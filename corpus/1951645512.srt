1
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:30,179
- I'm calling the cops.
- You had a stop sign, why didn't you just...

2
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,021
What do you think you are doing? No!

3
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,327
Shut up.

4
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:14,396
We have to stop. There's an accident.
Tell the children to look the other way.

5
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,476
Play hurt!

6
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:29,874
What happened?

7
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,753
Everybody, sit down.

8
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,913
Move over, lady.
Keep your eyes on that window.

9
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,685
Boy, you deaf or something?

10
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:44,259
Shep, boot it!

11
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,763
Back off, fuckers, or I'm shooting again.

12
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,714
Keep moving. Shep, put all these
in the barn in front of you.

13
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,308
- Let's go.
- Get them up there.

14
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,386
Shoot at them, Shep.

15
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:23,085
- Keep going.
- Get in here, pull that door shut.

16
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,277
- Hello, Potter.
- Henderson, what are you doing here?

17
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,110
I'm Deputy SAC, Albany.

18
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,444
Did Lebow and Geller get in?

19
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,746
Geller is in there.
Lebow is 20 minutes behind you.

20
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,515
- How many of our people are on site?
- Seven, including me.

21
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,716
- Why so few?
- That's all I had available.

22
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,417
What about Hostage Rescue?

23
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,018
Team One is in Miami on a DEA raid.

24
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:33,394
Two is in Chicago on a bank robbery
that went barricade this morning.

25
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,296
So, what do I do for muscle?

26
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,266
Well, you got a raft of locals out there.

27
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,803
I don't trust locals.

28
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,731
As I recall, Potter, you don't trust anybody.

29
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:46,604
Sir, the director is going to be
in the AG's office at 3:00.

30
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,044
He wants you to call him then.

31
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,115
Thanks, Toby. Nice job setting this up.

32
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,741
Thank you, but I just got here.
This is all State stuff.

33
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,615
It belongs to Sgt. Roger Elb over here.

34
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,655
- Very good, Sergeant.
- Thank you, Mr. Potter.

35
00:05:56,823 --> 00:06:00,190
We are capable of receiving any digitized
or microwave communications.

36
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,194
We've got the high-speed data links
to the FBI mainframe...

37
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,856
and Toby explained to me
how you like to monitor the press.

38
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,763
- So I'm setting that up now.
- Very good.

39
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:13,100
- I understand we have deaf hostages?
- Yeah. From a local school.

40
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,640
We'll need an interpreter,
someone from the school.

41
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:16,800
We're working on it.

42
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:20,003
Sergeant, do you have an extra flack vest
and a bullhorn?

43
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,876
- Yes, sir.
- John.

44
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,141
- Yeah?
- About Mrs. Potter, I...

45
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:26,012
Thanks, Toby. I got your very nice note.

46
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,485
- Sorry I didn't write back.
- Don't mention it.

47
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,284
Here you go, sir.

48
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,842
- Who is in charge?
- Mr. Henderson, with the FBI.

49
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,313
I am John Potter from the FBI.

50
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,817
I guess that would
make you in charge, then.

51
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,181
I'm Lenny Budd.

52
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,223
Sir, my men were pretty excited
when they heard you were coming.

53
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,792
Are you in charge
of the state troopers here, Captain?

54
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:43,760
Yes, sir. I am.
But why don't you just call me Lenny?

55
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,831
Okay, Lenny, what's the situation?

56
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,932
You see those two boarded-up windows?

57
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:53,028
There's been some kind of movement.
Glints, maybe a gun barrel or a scope.

58
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,970
- Then, they seem to...
- We'll get to that.

59
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,507
How many people do you have here?

60
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:01,203
I've got 37 troopers and six police from
the town of Beaumont, their whole force.

61
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,442
Where are they deployed?

62
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:07,144
Behind those trees is the river.
I've got seven in the trees over there.

63
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:11,314
I've got 10 in this grove to the left.
I've got eight covering the field out back...

64
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,858
and six that you see here.

65
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,552
Who is in charge of the local police?

66
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,755
Gene Stillwell. He is the chief
of the Beaumont police force here.

67
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,730
- Do you want to meet him?
- No. In a minute.

68
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,960
Leave the people in the trees where they are.

69
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,867
These troopers here, pull them back.

70
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:29,066
Everywhere in front of this point,
just consider the kill zone.

71
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:33,111
From now on, anyone out there needs
to be in good cover with full body armor.

72
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,847
Second, those news vans out back,
move them.

73
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,780
At least a mile away.

74
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:42,352
Mr. Henderson said
they would be okay there.

75
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:45,385
- Did he?
- They won't like being moved, sir.

76
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:48,352
Fuck them. They've got long lenses.
Let them use them.

77
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:51,692
We have never done anything like this
before, sir. We'll get sued.

78
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:52,991
Fine. They can sue.

79
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,466
- Wait here.
- Yes, sir.

80
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,008
I figured it out.

81
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,601
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

82
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,309
The cattle,
they are out in the stockyard, right?

83
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:12,145
They channel them through here,
one by one.

84
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:15,618
And then, bam! Bullet in the head.
That's what they do.

85
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,746
- They just shoot them, right?
- No kidding.

86
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:22,757
And they get hoisted up on to these hooks.
They get spun around here...

87
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,989
through here toward the guys down here,
and then... What?

88
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,502
What's going on? What?

89
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,273
Come on. What's going on?

90
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,353
Get up.

91
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,786
- What's up?
- I don't know.

92
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,124
Kind of exciting, huh?

93
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,569
Exciting?

94
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,631
- I'm Sonny.
- Hey.

95
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,434
They don't want to fuck you,
so just leave them alone.

96
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,806
Shit, Handy. I was just talking to them.

97
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:15,506
I don't want you fucking them, either.
So you just keep it tucked in, boy.

98
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,105
<i>You men in the building.</i>

99
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:22,077
<i>This is John Potter.
I'm with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</i>

100
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,380
<i>I would like to talk to you men in there.</i>

101
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,516
<i>- We'll have a cellular phone brought up.
- Well, well.</i>

102
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,525
<i>- In about 10 minutes.
- Mr. John Potter.</i>

103
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,325
<i>- We are not planning an assault.
- Guess we're finished, boys.</i>

104
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:33,989
- Why? Who the hell is that?
- Shit.

105
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,035
He's John Potter. He's with the FBI.

106
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,230
And they are not going to attack,
but they are sending us a phone.

107
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,465
I thought you was deaf, lady.

108
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,978
She is, but she reads lips.

109
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,012
Her name is Melanie and she's a teacher.

110
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,051
I'm just the bus driver, but I'm going to...

111
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:57,213
I'm really happy for you, but would you
mind shutting your fucking mouth?

112
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,520
Excuse me?

113
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,126
What was that little motion she made?
What was that?

114
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,698
What did that one there say to me?

115
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,769
She said, "Please don't hurt the children. "

116
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:14,699
Yeah? Tell me what she said.

117
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,304
What did she really say, lady?

118
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,774
She said you were an asshole.

119
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:22,009
That's what I thought you said.

120
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,116
You're right.

121
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,514
- All these roads are sealed, right?
- Yes, sir.

122
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,921
And I want the river sealed, too,
both directions.

123
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,222
- That's the Niagara River, sir.
- I know. I want it closed.

124
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,158
See, downriver, closer to Lake Ontario...

125
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,291
the Coast Guard's on our side,
Canadian Coast Guard on their side.

126
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:44,801
They've both been alerted.

127
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,734
But up here, we got a lot of rapids.

128
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,833
We can't use regular boats there.
You have to use those Zodiac boats.

129
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,672
Neither the Coast Guard
nor the police have any.

130
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,045
Fine. Borrow some men from
the Coast Guard. Rent some of those boats.

131
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,243
Buy them if you have to, but block the river.

132
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:03,788
- We are ready for you, John.
- All right. Let's take this inside.

133
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:14,831
- You okay, John?
- Yeah, I'm fine, Henry.

134
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:19,665
<i>Potter himself, seen here in file footage,
was wounded by flying debris...</i>

135
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,900
<i>and was hospitalized for 16 weeks,
during which time...</i>

136
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,169
<i>his wife of 26 years
died of an unrelated illness.</i>

137
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:26,676
I didn't watch those hearings, you?

138
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,644
<i>After weeks of congressional investigation...</i>

139
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,081
<i>Potter was exonerated of wrongdoing
in the massive explosion.</i>

140
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,243
<i>Indeed, some observers credit the FBI...</i>

141
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,514
<i>with avoiding
a much more serious disaster...</i>

142
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,146
<i>had the bomb gone off in the original target.</i>

143
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,888
<i>Still, critics of the FBI voiced protest
over Potter's return to his high-level post...</i>

144
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,931
<i>and Houston has been coupled with Waco
in the minds of many.</i>

145
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:50,991
<i>Except for his congressional testimony,
Potter has never made any public...</i>

146
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,235
Pardon me, Mr. Potter.

147
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:57,573
And in case anybody is interested,
that's still true.

148
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:00,509
I have nothing to say about Houston.

149
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,079
Okay, let's all get up to speed.

150
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,650
We've established
a threat management team here...

151
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,981
myself, my intelligence officer,
Henry Lebow...

152
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:12,615
my communications officer, Toby Geller,
and Capt. Budd, who'll serve as my deputy.

153
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,189
There will also be a containment officer
who I haven't picked yet.

154
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:17,757
All right.

155
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,364
At 1:30 this morning, these three escaped...

156
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:24,766
from the Lewisburg Maximum Security
Federal Penitentiary in central Pennsylvania.

157
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:26,461
Theodore Jeremiah Handy.

158
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:29,741
Shephard Wilcox.

159
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,301
Ray "Sonny" Bonner.

160
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:35,775
Handy is serving a life sentence
for robbery, arson and murder.

161
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:40,042
Seven months ago, he, Wilcox,
Handy's girlfriend, and another perp...

162
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,053
robbed the President's Federal
Savings Bank in Pittsburgh...

163
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,817
made off with $2,200,000.

164
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,449
And as I recall, they never found the loot.

165
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,724
They apprehended Handy and Wilcox
in Canada three weeks later.

166
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,426
The girlfriend got away.
And the other perp was killed in a firefight.

167
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:58,367
Handy's girlfriend, Pris Gunder,
was never apprehended.

168
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,337
- We don't even have a picture.
- What about him?

169
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:06,910
Bonner and Handy were cellmates.
He was in Lewisburg for interstate flight.

170
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,478
Suspected serial rapist.

171
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:14,249
About that containment officer,
have any of you had HR experience?

172
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,813
You were going to say something, Chief?

173
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,787
No. Well...

174
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,752
We did have a situation on a farm.

175
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:26,929
A fellow killed his wife and was threatening
to do the same with his two boys.

176
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,294
What did you do, Chief?

177
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,902
I didn't really know what to do.
We didn't have any of this stuff.

178
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:37,200
I talked to him.
I spent about 20 hours on the phone.

179
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:40,244
- And you stayed with it the full time?
- Yes, sir.

180
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:43,480
- How did it end?
- He came out. He gave himself up.

181
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,913
And the boys?

182
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:48,919
They were okay,
apart from seeing their mother that way.

183
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:54,718
Good work. You are my containment officer,
if that's all right with you.

184
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,988
Yes, sir. Anything I can do to help.

185
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,665
Could I talk to you outside for a second?

186
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:09,574
What the hell is going on? That's my job
and you goddamn well know it.

187
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,940
You don't have the sort of temperament
I need for this containment.

188
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,478
And that upstate hick does?

189
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,710
With all due respect, sir,
you've been gone a long time.

190
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,951
Meanwhile, there has been lots of training...

191
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,849
based on mistakes made at Waco...

192
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,785
- Ruby Ridge, and Houston.
- I wrote those manuals.

193
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:29,257
I was there in Houston
and that was your call all the way.

194
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:32,493
You're relieved of duty
at this barricade, Agent.

195
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,193
Order your team to report to Chief Stillwell
and evacuate the site.

196
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:43,432
That big rep of yours might have
skated you past some congressmen...

197
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,635
but inside we know
it is running out of wind.

198
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:49,703
My reputation is irrelevant, Henderson.
It is my authority that counts.

199
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:58,314
Let's go over the rules of the engagement.

200
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,585
There will be
no rescue attempts whatsoever.

201
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,491
We will keep the takers
within 100 yards of the building.

202
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,187
They will not cross that boundary.

203
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,994
If any of them attempt to do so,
your troops are cleared to fire.

204
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,764
Shoot to wound unless there is
a direct present threat to a hostage.

205
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,230
Got that?

206
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,700
- Where is the throw phone?
- It's ready.

207
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,171
Let's go to work.

208
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,204
I was wondering...

209
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,546
You hardly said two words
about them kids in there.

210
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,043
What's your point?

211
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,984
Shouldn't you have reminded everybody...

212
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,557
that our number one priority
is getting them out alive?

213
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,489
That's not our number one priority at all.

214
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:38,859
Our number one priority is to end
this situation with a minimum loss of life.

215
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:41,228
I'm not sure I fully understand that.

216
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,496
This way
he can only kill the nine hostages.

217
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,330
Jesus.

218
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:49,202
Maybe we can save those kids in there
and maybe we can't.

219
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,242
But we can sure as hell
keep them from killing anybody else.

220
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,642
The only way
they are coming out of that building...

221
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,510
is in handcuffs or body bags.

222
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,814
Clear enough for you?

223
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,885
We've got gas, but it ain't gonna work.

224
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,083
I don't think it's run since 1950.

225
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,489
Yeah, figures.

226
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,321
How much gas we got in that canister there?

227
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,397
Nearly full.

228
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:16,166
You planning on doing some plumbing
in here?

229
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:23,006
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Put that back in the duffel bag right now.

230
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,572
What the hell is all this shit for?

231
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,907
It's none of your damn business, is it?

232
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:32,709
Get back to that fucking window
where I put you and watch for them goons.

233
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,415
Moron.

234
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,960
This trooper is going to make
the run with that phone.

235
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,520
- What's your name, Officer?
- Steven Cardy, but I go by Stevie, mostly.

236
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,292
- How old are you?
- I'm 22, sir.

237
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,494
You're the high-school quarterback that
joined the troopers for excitement?

238
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,696
- How do you know that?
- You have that look.

239
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,576
- Enjoying it so far?
- Yes, sir. I am.

240
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:02,110
I'm sorry, sir. I mean, it's a terrible situation.

241
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,876
- I'm happy to help as much as I can.
- I know what you mean.

242
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,644
I don't want any heroics today.

243
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,220
You see that pen out there?

244
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,551
I want you to move up there
and you pitch this...

245
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:15,093
as far as you can towards the front door
of that slaughterhouse.

246
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,718
What if I hit the building with it?

247
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,729
It's a special phone and the bag is padded.

248
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:22,392
If you hit the building from there,
you ought to give up law enforcement...

249
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,832
and try out for the Jets.

250
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,469
Yes, sir. Okay.

251
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,196
<i>This is Agent Potter again.</i>

252
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:32,575
<i>One of my men is going to throw this phone
as close as he can.</i>

253
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,214
<i>This is not a trick.
It is simply a cellular phone.</i>

254
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,452
<i>Will you let our man approach?</i>

255
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,157
You can go.

256
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,823
- Are you sure that means yes?
- They would have said no with a bullet.

257
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,486
- Go on. Keep low.
- Yes, sir.

258
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,449
What the hell is he doing?

259
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:22,322
I don't know, sir.
Maybe he wants to get closer.

260
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,656
<i>That's far enough, Stevie.
Throw it from there.</i>

261
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,227
Mark down, first contact with the hostage.

262
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:37,594
Content? What's the communication?

263
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,298
I don't know. Where's the interpreter?

264
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,970
- Christ!
- They're on their way.

265
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,174
Set up a video camera
with a telephoto lens...

266
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,308
and keep it focused
on that upstairs window.

267
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,578
Right.

268
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,919
<i>- Yeah.
- Theodore Handy?</i>

269
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:07,160
- Yeah!
- This is John Potter, FBI.

270
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,261
I'd like to talk to you, Ted.
Can I call you Ted?

271
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,200
Well, you got us surrounded...

272
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,932
you got a lot of goons
up there in the trees with guns...

273
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,873
you can pretty much call me
whatever you want to.

274
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,971
Ted, this is a real tense situation.

275
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,344
<i>No, I'm not tense, I'm not tense at all.
In fact, I'm really relaxed...</i>

276
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,512
'cause I'm getting ready to shoot
one of these little kids.

277
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,917
Ted, I don't think you want to kill anybody.

278
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,579
<i>- Do you go by Jack?
- John, actually.</i>

279
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:34,556
Okay, Jack, now what makes you think...

280
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,060
that I'm not going to shoot myself
one of these kids?

281
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,561
'Cause if you do that...

282
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:41,064
I have to conclude
that you plan to kill all of them.

283
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,997
That's when we come in and take you out.

284
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:46,434
<i>Bullshit! That's bullshit.
There's no way you're going to take...</i>

285
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:49,029
<i>a chance at coming in here
and shooting one of these kids.</i>

286
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:53,373
I'm asking you not to kill anyone, Ted.
Can I have your word on that?

287
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:57,172
Well, I don't know, Jack.
Should I or shouldn't I?

288
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,914
<i>Like, should I or shouldn't I?
You know how that happens sometimes...</i>

289
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,817
you just can't make up your fucking mind?

290
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:12,094
Mr. Potter, I'm Constance Stanley
from Laurent Clerc school.

291
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,563
We've been anxious for you to get here.

292
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,589
How are they?

293
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,863
They're all still alive, as far as we know.

294
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,203
- You brought the profiles?
- Yes.

295
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,308
Here, please sit down.

296
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:31,041
- The young teacher?
- Melanie Charrol.

297
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,283
She signed something to me
from the window.

298
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,359
I'm sorry, it's not funny. It's just that
you're making the sign for drink.

299
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,087
Could it have been this?

300
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,792
- That's it.
- That's the sign for help.

301
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,728
- That makes sense, she wants help.
- Right.

302
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:56,035
But if you're doing it correctly,
then she wasn't saying, "You help. "

303
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,132
She was saying, "Help you. "

304
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:01,337
- Help me?
- Yes. Well, I mean, I can't be sure.

305
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:07,110
I don't understand her wanting to help me,
I can understand her wanting help.

306
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,821
I can even understand her wanting a drink.

307
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,654
When this is over,
I'll buy her a double martini.

308
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,092
- How're doing? How's everybody doing?
- God, what are you doing now?

309
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,822
I sure hope nobody smokes.

310
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:23,063
I chew, but I gave up smoking years ago.

311
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:25,766
<i>- Yeah.
- Jack, how you doing?</i>

312
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,600
Listen, I want to introduce you...

313
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,731
<i>to Donna, she's the bus driver.</i>

314
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:33,902
Yeah, here, say hi, and then tell him
exactly what I'm doing. Go.

315
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:36,971
He's sprinkling gasoline...

316
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,880
<i>- all over the room.
- How are the children?</i>

317
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:42,717
<i>They're fine, except for Beverly.</i>

318
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,118
<i>She has asthma...</i>

319
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:48,181
- and these fumes aren't going to help...
- Let's go, down the stairs, honey.

320
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:50,591
Tell them exactly what I'm doing now.
Don't miss a beat.

321
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,493
He's sprinkling gasoline
all the way down the stairs.

322
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,656
Keep going, honey.

323
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,064
<i>Turn to your right,
all the way down to the bottom.</i>

324
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:00,138
<i>We're going down.
We're on the second floor.</i>

325
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,728
Head's up, Shep!

326
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:06,006
Baby! What's that there?

327
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,246
- It's a lantern.
- Tell him.

328
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:10,871
- He's pointing to a lantern.
- Right.

329
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,507
What would happen if that lantern fell over?

330
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,550
<i>- The third floor would go up in flames.
- Good. Stand right there.</i>

331
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:18,782
Jack, did you hear that?
Do you get the picture?

332
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,323
We get the picture.

333
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:23,656
Good, hang on a sec, Jack.
I'll be with you in a second here.

334
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,093
Hey, Sonny.

335
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:28,257
This here's gonna be your spot,
it's gonna be your post, okay?

336
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:29,890
I want you right there on the steps.

337
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:34,062
In case any of those little canary birds
come down here, toss that lantern over.

338
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:37,869
If someone tries to shoot or
come in the windows, toss the lantern over.

339
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,041
Come on, man, that means
I'm stuck here with them up there...

340
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,843
I'm here alone and you guys are downstairs.

341
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:47,683
- You got a problem with that?
- No.

342
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:51,151
Let's go, walk.

343
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,082
Jack, you're still there?

344
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,718
<i>Listen, this here is something neat...</i>

345
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,854
<i>- I'm going to let the bus driver go.
- No.</i>

346
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:04,268
- Wait! Let one of the children go, please.
- No. This is your lucky day, darling.

347
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:08,266
<i>- Great, Ted. I appreciate that.
- I want to let you know that I'm not all bad.</i>

348
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:10,739
- Check you later.
- How are you going to talk to them?

349
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,504
Melanie and me is going
to get along just fine, darling.

350
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:30,422
- Go on out there and meet her, Stevie.
- Yes, sir.

351
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:46,641
Why would he tell us about
the gasoline and then send her out?

352
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:52,343
John, don't try it. John!

353
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,580
Get down!

354
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:01,685
Don't run.

355
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,127
No, stay down! Get on the ground!

356
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,538
Downlink!

357
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,621
- Potter.
- Jack.

358
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:35,420
There's one thing you got to understand
about me. I don't care about that bus driver.

359
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,290
I don't care about the teacher
or these little boys and girls.

360
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:41,627
These are all just like
little birds I use to shoot back home...

361
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:44,827
<i>off my front porch.
Now, you can go pick her up.</i>

362
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,962
I'm not going to shoot you.
You just better give me what I want.

363
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:51,573
- And what do you want?
- Get back to you on that.

364
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,620
Should we move some of our people closer?

365
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,817
No, we do nothing. Nothing.

366
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,451
It's his move.

367
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:02,966
Downlink.

368
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,569
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Jack.

369
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,148
Listen, I've had a chance
to think it over. Did you?

370
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,514
Yes, I did. But we have to get
one thing straight.

371
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:18,146
I'm the only man in this universe
that can get you out of there alive.

372
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:21,453
There's nobody else.
I'm the one to reckon with, Ted.

373
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,357
That may be, but in the meantime,
you know, we're starving.

374
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:27,829
My buddy is starting to disappear
before my eyes. You should see him.

375
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,991
You know what we never get in prison?

376
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,161
<i>- Pizza. Ain't that right, Shep?
- Where's the nearest pizza place?</i>

377
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:36,299
There's one over at Beaumont,
10-15 minutes.

378
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,805
It'll take about an hour, Ted. What else?

379
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,844
<i>- A helicopter, real big one.
- I'll work on it. What else?</i>

380
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:46,105
<i>Let me see. I need 100 rounds
of 12-gauge double aught.</i>

381
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,218
I guess you know I can't do that.

382
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,817
<i>- Even if I was to give you a girl, Jack?
- Sorry.</i>

383
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,249
<i>Weapons and ammo are deal breakers.</i>

384
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,021
Yeah, I hear you, Jack.

385
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,154
<i>But if we were to do some horse-trading,
which one would you want?</i>

386
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:03,098
<i>Would you want anyone in particular?
How about the teacher?</i>

387
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:05,567
<i>I mean, she's so fucking sexy, isn't she?</i>

388
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,104
<i>She looks good, she smells good.</i>

389
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:09,988
Hell, if I wasn't so devoted to Priscilla,
I'd take a stab at her myself.

390
00:30:10,023 --> 00:30:11,771
Hell, if I wasn't so devoted to Priscilla,
I'd take a stab at her myself.

391
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:14,936
<i>- Yeah, one of the girls has asthma.
- Yeah, no shit.</i>

392
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,813
For a deaf kid, she sure makes a racket,
I'll tell you that.

393
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,180
<i>That means she's coming out, Ted?</i>

394
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:24,744
No, Jack. What it means is I'm going
to shoot her in exactly two minutes...

395
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:27,552
if I don't get that ammo. Start timing.

396
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,619
Shit.

397
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,857
Get up. Sit down, lady. Sit down.

398
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,763
Get down on your ass, get your ass down.

399
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,597
- Jesus!
- He's at the window.

400
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:49,812
- Call it out, Toby.
- One minute, 30 seconds.

401
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,679
Do something.
Tell him you'll give him the shells.

402
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,085
- No.
- He's going to shoot her.

403
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,221
I don't think he will.

404
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,492
- Sonny!
- Yeah.

405
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:08,327
- Get up here now!
- Coming! What?

406
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,901
Get this one, take her down to the post
and tie her up.

407
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:13,527
- Take her down right now, hurry up.
- Come on. Move.

408
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:21,710
One minute.

409
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:26,943
- Send them some blanks.
- Maybe some ammo that'll jam the guns?

410
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,075
No.

411
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:33,390
- Okay, that's it. I'm going out there.
- Hold it, Lenny. You're not going anywhere.

412
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:36,092
He's going to kill her in cold blood.

413
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:37,889
- He's not.
- Thirty seconds.

414
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:40,226
How the hell do you know that?

415
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:51,331
Twenty seconds.

416
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,137
Fifteen seconds.

417
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:02,252
Ten seconds, nine, eight...

418
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,685
Three, two.

419
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:12,156
Zero, that's two minutes.

420
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,358
Two minutes, five seconds.

421
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:29,044
Downlink.

422
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:30,671
Thank God.

423
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,408
<i>- Yeah.
- Hey, Jack. How's it hanging?</i>

424
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,145
Fair to middling. How about you?

425
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,881
I'm doing just fine, thanks for asking.
Here's the deal.

426
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:41,686
I'm going to shoot me one of these kids
every hour till the chopper gets here.

427
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,229
That's one an hour, every hour,
starting at 4:00 p. m.

428
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:48,393
And I'm also gonna need me
100 rounds of ammo...

429
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:49,761
<i>for the Glocks as well.</i>

430
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:52,961
Why, I guess you're not hearing me, Ted.
No ammo, period.

431
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:56,866
The food will be there in 40 minutes.
When you get it, I get the girl.

432
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:01,412
You owe me this one.
You shot one. This one's mine.

433
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,482
- You really want her, Jack?
- I really want them all, Ted.

434
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:10,650
You're a pistol, that's what you are, Jack.
You're one big pistol.

435
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:14,156
All right, I'm going to let you
have this little yellow hacker.

436
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:17,557
For the food
and for that chopper at 4:00 p. m.

437
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:28,168
That's good, Mr. Potter, that's real good.
We can get your helo in 30 minutes.

438
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,907
We don't need one, Lenny.
We're not letting him go mobile.

439
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,570
- He's going to kill them all.
- So he says.

440
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,374
And you're willing to take that risk?

441
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:40,474
That's my job, Lenny.
That's why I'm here, to talk him out of it.

442
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,394
- Will you even talk to us?
- I have no comment.

443
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,596
Are you here to take over
the hostage negotiation?

444
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,798
I've nothing to say,
I'm not here to take over.

445
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:06,104
- Is the governor trying to get Potter fired?
- No, it's nothing like that.

446
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,702
We are doing the best we can,
we're trying very hard.

447
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,179
We're being held a mile...

448
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:20,985
Move it!

449
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,220
- Let's go!
- Come on.

450
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:37,638
Our state police HRT is here,
along with the brass.

451
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:42,035
- Did you request them?
- No, I did not. I would have told you if I did.

452
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,385
Agent Potter.

453
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:55,190
I'm Roland Marks, Assistant Attorney
General for the state of New York.

454
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:59,724
And this is State Police Major Tremain.

455
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:02,699
I brought our hostage rescue team
with me, Mr. Potter.

456
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,461
They would have been here hours ago...

457
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:08,005
but, if you can believe it,
we never received any kind of notification...

458
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,733
or request for assistance.

459
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:14,007
The governor thought I should get
down here and offer our assistance...

460
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,377
make sure there are no more
communication glitches like that one.

461
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:20,940
Thank you, but that was no glitch,
we have the situation under control.

462
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,179
But the FBI HRT is in Miami.

463
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,518
I know for a fact they can't leave
before tonight, at the earliest.

464
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:29,092
- That's true.
- He shot a hostage.

465
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,090
If he shoots one, he'll shoot the others.

466
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:35,154
That calls for an immediate tactical
response, it's standard operating procedure.

467
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,234
That's not my judgment in this case.

468
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:43,231
- I notice that you're monitoring the press.
- Yes.

469
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:47,642
Do you realize that there's
a great deal of public interest...

470
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:50,441
- and sympathy for the deaf children?
- I bet there is.

471
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:53,176
Yet, you've ignored
every request for a press briefing.

472
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,343
Yes, we're very busy here.

473
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,618
In fact, if that's all, we're still busy.

474
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:02,519
What? Are you telling us to leave?

475
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:06,562
As you can see, sir, this is
a very small space for us all to work in.

476
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:10,658
- Can I see you outside?
- Certainly.

477
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,797
Are you aware that everything
in that shack...

478
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:18,273
and the people are working
for the state of New York?

479
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:22,142
And we appreciate the assistance,
but this is still a Federal operation.

480
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:25,079
- You're not planning an assault, are you?
- No.

481
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,846
Have you offered to exchange yourself
or other personnel for those children?

482
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,319
- Have you asked for volunteers?
- No.

483
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:34,653
We understand they've offered to trade
the hostages for a helicopter.

484
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,125
- They're not getting one.
- Well, why not?

485
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:40,686
You could track it on radar with
a homing device, they wouldn't get away.

486
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:42,129
It's too risky.

487
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:44,929
There is a known quantity of casualties
right now.

488
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:47,471
You just came off a suspension, didn't you?

489
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:50,166
No, I took leave for personal reasons.

490
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:54,801
Everyone has the greatest sympathy
about Mrs. Potter.

491
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:58,177
- Including, clearly, the congressmen who...
- Look, I don't know you...

492
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:00,978
so don't go mentioning
sympathy for my wife.

493
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:04,846
You're free to complain about me
to the governor or to Washington...

494
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:07,948
you be my guest. Excuse me.

495
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,127
You got it?

496
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:21,404
Light him up.

497
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:27,175
<i>- Lower your face shield and say something.
- What should I say?</i>

498
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:29,743
That's fine. Okay, get him dressed.

499
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,352
Get as close to the doorway as you can,
I want to see what's inside.

500
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:38,945
What kind of weapons they have,
radios, portable TVs, whatever.

501
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:40,648
Yes, sir. No problem.

502
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,783
You should stand in the doorway...

503
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:45,885
but do not, under any circumstances,
go inside.

504
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,824
All right, but what if he won't release
her unless I do?

505
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,924
You just leave the food, walk away.

506
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:54,471
If it's between you and the hostage,
you save yourself first.

507
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:57,473
- Well, sir, if I...
- That's an order, trooper.

508
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:01,005
Okay, send him out.
I'll tell him you're coming.

509
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:12,022
- Hey, Sonny.
- Yeah.

510
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:15,752
Sonny, bring down that teacher
and that little kid...

511
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,829
who makes all of them hacking noises,
bring them down right now.

512
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,294
Just a second.

513
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:24,166
Hey, Jack...

514
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,293
<i>I'm sure you got a wire on that boy, right?</i>

515
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:29,567
- What if I do?
- I want you to tell him to stop, right now.

516
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:30,641
Why?

517
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,437
I don't want him to get here
and think he can snoop around.

518
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:36,445
I know how you fuckers work,
I've been barricaded before, man.

519
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:39,675
- I'm a pro.
- Stevie, hold it right there.

520
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,426
Bring them here.

521
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,842
Okay, we've got some food coming.

522
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:10,880
Some food that's outside.

523
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:14,914
You are going to go outside
and get the food...

524
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:21,084
You're gonna go home, okay?

525
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,023
So, that's the deal. Go get food...

526
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:28,331
I'm just going to have to shoot her.

527
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:36,506
Go. Come on, we're hungry. Let's move it.

528
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,003
That'll do it.

529
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,541
Come on, all the way.

530
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:47,546
When you come back, I'll be waiting for you.

531
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:57,226
Yeah, love, go.

532
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,762
Shit.

533
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,506
Get him back.

534
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,278
Uplink.

535
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:23,079
Hey, Ted, I'm coming out there.
That kid forgot two large pepperonis.

536
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:41,304
Downlink.

537
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:45,933
- Yeah.
- I want you to stop right where you are.

538
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:48,841
And I want you to tell that cop-boy of yours
to go back to you...

539
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:52,109
'cause I don't want you getting closer to her
than you already are.

540
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:53,706
Stevie, come here.

541
00:40:58,522 --> 00:40:59,580
Melanie...

542
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:03,187
I'm John Potter, I'm with the FBI.

543
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,021
Can you understand me?

544
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:08,154
Good. I want you to pretend...

545
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:12,836
that you're looking through the pizza boxes,
but keep your eyes on me.

546
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:17,268
- Move over there, closer, and go slow.
- Yes, sir.

547
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,038
Don't block her line of vision to me.

548
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,446
Melanie.

549
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:30,449
...but we can see you signing
through the upstairs window.

550
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:35,347
We're trying to get you out,
but we need your help, okay?

551
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:41,421
I want to know how the children are.
And I want to know about the three men.

552
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:47,832
- Just hurry this shit up, Jack.
- Yeah, okay.

553
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,303
Little faster, Stevie.

554
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:52,242
Good.

555
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,611
I want you to take the pizza and go back.

556
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,039
I'm sorry I have to send you back.

557
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:00,907
You be careful.

558
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,116
Be careful.

559
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:17,698
<i>- Yes.
- Ted.</i>

560
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:20,767
You got your pizza, send out Beverly.

561
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,668
You're sure that's the one you want, Jack?

562
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:24,434
You sure you don't want Melanie instead?

563
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,204
I can sort of see you looking
at her out there.

564
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,677
She does have a set on her, doesn't she?

565
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:33,441
- Send the girl out, Ted.
- Okay.

566
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:39,283
Bye-bye. Get rid of this kid.

567
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,989
Go get her.

568
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:54,938
Okay.

569
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:17,285
What is it?

570
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:19,919
Chief Stillwell saw someone
at the south end of the field.

571
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,225
- Did he fire?
- No, shot came from the building.

572
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,732
Sir, look.

573
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:27,395
Shit!

574
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:30,933
- Tell everybody, no return fire.
- Yes, sir.

575
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:34,875
- I'm coming up. Stevie, come with me.
- Yes, sir.

576
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:41,740
Theodore Handy, I'm Roland Marks!

577
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,254
Assistant Attorney General
for the state of New York.

578
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:50,989
I want you to let the kids go
and take me in their place.

579
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,153
We don't want you.

580
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:59,999
Handy, I'm alone and unarmed.

581
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:02,865
He's stepping lively.

582
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:05,407
If he gets any closer,
I'm gonna have to shoot him.

583
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:12,007
For the love of God, Handy,
let those children go.

584
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:19,149
<i>Marks, this is Potter.</i>

585
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:22,616
<i>Get under cover immediately,
or you will be arrested.</i>

586
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:24,554
I'm trying to save them.

587
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,190
<i>No, you are endangering them.</i>

588
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:32,663
I want you to give up the kids, Handy,
and take me in their place.

589
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:34,235
Do you hear me?

590
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:38,305
I said I don't want you.

591
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:46,742
I swear, that one went right by his ear.

592
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,784
There's no reason to shoot me. I'm unarmed.

593
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:50,615
Kissing the worms, man.

594
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:52,450
- I just want to talk to you.
- Hey.

595
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:54,183
Hey, Sonny.

596
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:56,418
- Yeah.
- Get your ass down here, right now.

597
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,927
What you doing, girl?
You snooping around here?

598
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,018
What?

599
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,564
Get your ass down here
and get this lady upstairs.

600
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:03,792
Get her now.

601
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:06,069
We have to get him out of there.

602
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,803
Stay low, son.

603
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,067
I'm trying to help you, you understand that?

604
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:18,542
Get down on the ground, sir.
You're interfering with a Federal operation.

605
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:21,949
What the hell are you talking about?
You're working for me.

606
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,713
And don't you forget it.

607
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:27,123
Handy...

608
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:30,293
if you let the kids come out...

609
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:33,691
I'm prepared to negotiate in good faith.

610
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,727
- I'm gonna have to take you in, sir.
- Yeah, I'd like to see you try.

611
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:43,170
Sir, my orders are to shoot you in the leg
and drag you back.

612
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:51,536
Let's go!

613
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:01,221
<i>Handy, you son of a bitch,
I'll see you rot in hell.</i>

614
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:05,719
Crazy old fuck.

615
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:08,055
Let's eat.

616
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:17,107
Never exchange hostages, Marks.

617
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:19,607
The whole point of negotiation
is to devalue them.

618
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,304
If he'd gotten you,
it would have made my job impossible.

619
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:23,401
I don't see why.

620
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:26,142
A hostage like you would have boosted
his sense of power...

621
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,342
and courage a hundred times.

622
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,510
He'd up his demands and stick to them.

623
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,384
I don't care about that.
What I care about is those hostages.

624
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:35,390
Really? It had nothing to do with
those cameras out there?

625
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:38,655
Are you implying that I'd risk my life
for some kind of publicity?

626
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:41,595
Unlike you, I happen to care about
those women and children.

627
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:44,098
Unlike you,
I'm willing to risk my life for them.

628
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:47,398
I'm not the one concerned
with rebuilding a shattered reputation.

629
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:48,471
John.

630
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:50,665
Yeah, what's up?

631
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:54,369
There's a detective second
on the Pittsburgh PD, a Sharon Foster.

632
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:57,714
She negotiated Handy's surrender
in the holdup five years ago.

633
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,682
- He gave up to her?
- He did, yes. Appears she's pretty good.

634
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:03,719
- Then get her up here.
- I thought you might say that.

635
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:07,279
So I connected her through
to the 5:00 puddle jumper from Buffalo.

636
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:09,689
The only reason
you needed to tell me that now...

637
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:13,058
- was to give me time to rein my temper.
- You know me so well.

638
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:14,164
Thanks.

639
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:20,196
Let's get something straight, Marks,
and you, too, Major.

640
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:22,795
If either of you
interfere with this barricade again...

641
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:26,307
I will arrest you and I'll see the US Attorney
makes sure you do time.

642
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,275
Then you should consider
your own actions...

643
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:31,541
because you could be facing state charges
for reckless endangerment.

644
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:33,616
I'll try to live with that.

645
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,414
Potter's bluffing. He'd never make that stick.

646
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,457
Yeah, you wanna take the chance?

647
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:43,958
So we just stand here
and watch them be murdered...

648
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:46,291
not lift a finger? Is that it?

649
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:47,821
No.

650
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:51,389
What we do is, hope to God
that Potter knows what he's doing.

651
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:52,559
Excuse me.

652
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:21,331
How is she?

653
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:24,025
They had to give her a shot,
but she should be all right.

654
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:27,399
- When will we be able to question her?
- She's at the window.

655
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:33,299
The children are okay.

656
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,141
They're scared, but they're all right.

657
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,944
They took Susan downstairs
and tied her up...

658
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:44,013
with the young one, right below us.

659
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:47,486
- The rapist.
- Supposedly likes very young children.

660
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,559
Susan might be too old for him.

661
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:55,724
They have a gun. Two shotguns and tools.

662
00:48:58,669 --> 00:48:59,761
New ones...

663
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:04,865
a hammer and a big monkey wrench.

664
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:08,036
I think I've found a way to escape.

665
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:11,746
There's a broken-down staircase
that they're not guarding.

666
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:15,475
I know you can't answer me,
or tell me what to do...

667
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:18,179
but I think you would want me to do it.

668
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:20,350
I don't want you to do it.

669
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,752
And so I will try.

670
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:33,001
You like some pizza?

671
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:37,129
No? Why?

672
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:39,834
You must be hungry.

673
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:42,912
Have some. Look.

674
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,574
Good pizza.

675
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:50,412
I haven't had pizza
in about eight-and-a-half months.

676
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,257
Want some?

677
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:39,669
Yeah.

678
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:43,773
There you go.

679
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:47,801
Good, huh?

680
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,627
It's good stuff.

681
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:28,518
Downlink.

682
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,217
- Yeah, hello, Ted.
- You know, Jack...

683
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:39,321
it's damn near 4:00 p. m.,
and I haven't heard nor seen no helicopter.

684
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:43,426
You gotta give us some time.
We're having trouble with the bulldozer.

685
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:44,761
What bulldozer?

686
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:48,103
Who the fuck asked for a bulldozer?

687
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:51,538
<i>Come on, Ted, we're both looking out
at the same field.</i>

688
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:53,905
Where's the helicopter supposed to land?

689
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:56,274
All that old junk, those old fence posts...

690
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:58,574
we gotta clear an area for 100 feet around.

691
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:01,173
I know you want the helicopter
close to the building.

692
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,717
<i>You're damn right I do.</i>

693
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:03,786
You see?

694
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:09,118
<i>- What about a pontoon chopper?
- A pontoon chopper.</i>

695
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:13,060
<i>- I'd have never thought about that.
- You damn well should've thought about it.</i>

696
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:15,859
<i>There's a goddamn river
out back here behind the building.</i>

697
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:19,993
<i>- Why, yes, but that's the Niagara River.
- Yeah, I know it's the Niagara River, Jack.</i>

698
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:23,402
<i>Good for you.
Because I had no idea till I got here.</i>

699
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:26,565
<i>They tell me the water is very fast,
the current.</i>

700
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:30,703
<i>Which just stands to reason, we're not
that far downriver from Niagara Falls.</i>

701
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:34,875
You might wanna land a helicopter,
but you'd be swept downriver right away.

702
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:37,553
You see? That's why we need the bulldozer.

703
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:41,513
Jack? Tell me something, Jack.

704
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:44,989
In Houston, with them fellows,
what'd they ask for?

705
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:47,620
They ask for a helicopter, bulldozer?

706
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:52,228
- They wanted a lot of things, Ted.
- I know, I mean, we saw it on C-Span...

707
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,599
all those fellows in Lewisburg
in prison there.

708
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:56,262
We was watching the hearings and...

709
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:59,206
You could hear a goddamn mouse fart
when you was on TV.

710
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:01,607
- Did you know that?
- No, I didn't.

711
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:04,407
<i>Yeah, you were on the stand
for, what, three days?</i>

712
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,311
- Three days.
- See, I knew that.

713
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:08,907
But, you know,
the thing that bothered me, Jack...

714
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:13,479
was they never asked you
if you thought that you fucked up.

715
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:16,220
<i>It seemed like a simple question to me...</i>

716
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:18,692
so I'm asking you, did you fuck up?

717
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:23,692
<i>- The investigation concluded...
- I don't give a shit about the investigation...</i>

718
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,928
that's not what I'm getting at.
What I'm getting at is...

719
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,604
when that building exploded...

720
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:32,600
did you feel bad?

721
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:36,208
<i>- Yes.
- Did it bother you?</i>

722
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,274
You lost those people,
I mean, those kids in the store...

723
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:43,148
<i>cops, your FBI brothers
and that poor fucking retard janitor.</i>

724
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:46,588
Answer the question, Jack.

725
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,193
Yes, it bothered me.

726
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:55,697
You see, right there, Jack.
We ought to change jobs, man.

727
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:57,630
Because that wouldn't bother me at all.

728
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,794
<i>The only thing that bothers me
is when I don't keep my promises.</i>

729
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,929
That doesn't seem to bother you at all,
does it?

730
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:07,032
<i>- Ted, this is a practical situation here.
- No, this is the situation.</i>

731
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:09,441
If that bulldozer is not here
within a half hour...

732
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:13,482
I promise, I give you my word that I'm gonna
kill that little what's-her-name...

733
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:17,041
- that Emily with the little red hair.
- Half an hour, that's not...

734
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:19,747
It's half an hour. That's a promise.

735
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:25,351
Can we get a bulldozer here in half an hour?

736
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:14,874
Okay, I'm gonna do something.

737
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:20,508
Okay? I don't want you to be afraid.

738
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:25,514
I'm gonna untie you,
just your one hand, all right?

739
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:32,792
See if I can get this. Let's untie it,
just like this.

740
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:37,561
See, get some circulation back in there.

741
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:41,166
That feels good, right?

742
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:42,638
Good.

743
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:45,633
Okay, now I'm gonna take your hand.

744
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:51,007
I just want you to relax.
Just relax. Okay. There you go.

745
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,976
Yeah, like this.

746
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:00,389
How does that feel? Fuck.

747
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:03,786
You gotta go easy, or do you like it rough?

748
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:07,693
Do you like it rough?
Yeah, you can pinch it. You can pinch it.

749
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:13,264
Be rough with me, yeah. I like that.
I like that.

750
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:24,470
- Hey, Sonny.
- Yeah?

751
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:26,742
Everything okay up there?

752
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,318
Everything's fine, Ted.

753
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:36,855
I'm telling you, okay?
Everything's gonna be fine, okay?

754
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:41,695
We're gonna have some fun now, okay?

755
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:43,860
Just a second here.

756
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:47,664
You'll be a lot more comfortable
when I take this off, okay?

757
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:51,569
Just a second. Wait.

758
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:07,356
Okay.

759
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:20,927
Here we go. Look, yeah, just relax. Fuck.

760
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:39,621
Jesus.

761
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:44,752
Get off me!

762
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:48,755
Hey, get off. Get off.

763
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:52,226
What are you doing?
Hold that one, will you?

764
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:56,066
What the fuck.

765
00:57:57,507 --> 00:58:00,340
- What, did you kill her?
- No, she's just knocked out.

766
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:03,703
It's that bitch's fault there.
She tried to jump me.

767
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:05,814
Bring her here.

768
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,820
Hey, you squirrelly woman.

769
00:58:13,189 --> 00:58:14,986
Here's what you're gonna do.

770
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:19,125
You're gonna stay the fuck upstairs
and you're gonna watch these kids...

771
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:22,221
and you're gonna keep these kids quiet.

772
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:25,295
And if you don't do that,
I'm gonna let Sonny...

773
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:29,235
pick one of them little canary birds
and do with her what he wants.

774
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:30,896
You understand?

775
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:34,239
Shep!

776
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:37,375
I know, just take these kids upstairs.

777
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:39,408
Get ready, sister.

778
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:54,759
Remember a couple of months ago
what the Calo brothers did to Joey?

779
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:55,853
Yeah.

780
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:57,625
Remember that...

781
00:58:57,734 --> 00:59:00,726
if it weren't for me, they would have done
the same thing for you?

782
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:03,738
Yeah, and I owe you.
I was just having fun, that's all.

783
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,832
I'll tell you something, right now, Sundance.

784
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:10,105
I'm in a death-defying line of work,
you understand?

785
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,306
And all I need is obedience.

786
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:15,179
I need people that I can trust to do
what I tell them to do.

787
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:18,550
You can trust me.
I just thought you meant...

788
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:23,715
You know something, if you fuck up again
I'm gonna have to kill you.

789
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:28,258
- I'm not gonna fuck up.
- I'm gonna have to kill you. Okay.

790
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:42,609
Great job. Nice timing.

791
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:45,112
We got one of our people
who can drive this thing?

792
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:47,205
- You're looking at him.
- You're kidding.

793
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:50,411
Do you want me to take my time
going real slow making this patch?

794
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,546
No, you can go as fast as you like.
But before you go out there...

795
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:56,181
drain out half the water
and three-quarters of the oil.

796
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:59,125
You know how much an engine
on one of these things costs?

797
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:00,195
$75,000.

798
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,730
- Now, ask me if I care.
- Sir, she's at the window.

799
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:04,630
- Now, ask me if I care.
- Sir, she's at the window.

800
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:10,632
I'm going to take the children there.
She's found a tunnel that leads to a river...

801
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:14,298
and she's gonna take the children there.
She's talking to the kids now.

802
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:26,352
I need you to get their attention
at the window for five minutes.

803
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:29,189
We'll start when we see you start.

804
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:31,958
We'll go, okay? But hurry.

805
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:33,986
Here. So must it be about there.

806
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:36,497
- Do we have our Zodiac boats on the river?
- Yes, sir.

807
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:38,567
Can we get somebody
to take these plans there?

808
01:00:38,668 --> 01:00:39,930
I can do it, sir.

809
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:42,664
Oh, and Lenny, warm up your bulldozer,
you're on.

810
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:43,739
Yes, sir.

811
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,707
Just one moment.
You're not gonna let them risk it?

812
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:50,746
I don't think I can stop them.
I'm not sure I would if I could.

813
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:52,212
But they could get killed.

814
01:00:52,515 --> 01:00:53,709
They could get killed anyway.

815
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,546
Look, Mrs. Stanley,
I'm sorry if that sounded callous...

816
01:00:56,753 --> 01:01:00,484
but a situation like this, you have
to think of the hostages as already dead.

817
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:03,690
That way, if we save some, we celebrate.

818
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:06,021
Get him.

819
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:08,223
Uplink.

820
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:09,798
Yeah.

821
01:01:10,066 --> 01:01:11,158
Got good news, Ted.

822
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:12,390
<i>Got me my chopper?</i>

823
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,561
Close, the bulldozer's here.

824
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:52,503
Ted, look at that.

825
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:11,752
This guy's so slow.

826
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:31,797
Start the engine.

827
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:35,173
Go through this side.

828
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,281
It's overheating pretty bad.

829
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:48,652
Good, now really gun it.

830
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:33,795
There goes $75,000.

831
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:36,936
Look at that shit.

832
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,854
Come on, Ted, you have to be reasonable.

833
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:54,787
How can we foresee
something like that happening?

834
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:56,657
What the fuck is that?

835
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:00,928
Jack, I'll get back to you.

836
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:11,707
That.

837
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,171
That's some kind of engine noise.

838
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:17,541
Sonny, check on those kids.

839
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:22,676
Fuck!

840
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:28,316
Shit!

841
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:31,951
Ted!

842
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:36,357
I was watching them every second, I swear!

843
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:38,592
I don't know what the hell happened!

844
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:49,202
I got it. Here we go.

845
01:05:53,249 --> 01:05:54,716
We'll be back.

846
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:00,355
Zodiac 1 to Zodiac 2, move in.

847
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:21,135
Watch it.

848
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:24,073
Okay, let's go.

849
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,545
Two out.

850
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:43,165
Go!

851
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:46,598
Melanie and the big girl, Susan.

852
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:48,664
They didn't make it.

853
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:49,938
They got them.

854
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:51,705
Shit!

855
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:58,612
Shep, let's go!

856
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:06,713
Hang on!

857
01:07:35,651 --> 01:07:39,280
Shots have been fired, a boat is over.
It's Stevie and one of the hostages.

858
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:04,479
Get out, you're blocked on both sides!

859
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,605
We can't risk it, not with the kid!

860
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:09,117
Pull out!

861
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:27,099
<i>Too dangerous to pursue
while the kids are in the boat.</i>

862
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:29,296
<i>Are there any more boats downstream?
Over.</i>

863
01:09:17,253 --> 01:09:19,687
<i>We have them in sight, they're okay.</i>

864
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:22,253
Chief Stillwell sent me
to pick up Det. Foster.

865
01:09:22,358 --> 01:09:24,724
Welcome, I'm Lenny Budd
and this is Agent Potter.

866
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:25,918
John Potter.

867
01:09:26,028 --> 01:09:28,326
Sharon Foster.
I understand you're in a situation...

868
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:31,399
- with an old friend of mine.
- The situation's very fluid right now.

869
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,058
Stand by, we're gonna need your help.

870
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:35,136
Get in here.

871
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:36,835
What's that now?

872
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:40,233
- What is that?
- A lamp.

873
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:44,578
Yeah, now, you are a bit of a moron, but
I want you to try to envision something.

874
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:48,714
This fucking lamp falls over,
the flame goes up them stairs...

875
01:09:48,817 --> 01:09:50,842
and the little kids burn like fucking toast...

876
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:54,480
and if the goons were to rush us,
all you had to do was stand here, right?

877
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:57,286
- Ted, I was.
- You were standing here? The whole time?

878
01:09:57,993 --> 01:09:59,119
Turn around.

879
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:02,263
- You see me, man?
- Yeah, I see you.

880
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:06,061
You know some other way to get down here
from up there?

881
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:07,226
- Answer him.
- No.

882
01:10:07,336 --> 01:10:08,349
Well, then, you tell me, man. You tell me.

883
01:10:08,384 --> 01:10:09,363
Well, then, you tell me, man. You tell me.

884
01:10:10,172 --> 01:10:13,505
How're they gonna get down here
from up there without you seeing them?

885
01:10:14,743 --> 01:10:18,509
Look at them and look at you,
they're smaller.

886
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:20,215
Right?

887
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:24,379
Shep, take the girls down and tie them up.

888
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:26,748
Take them downstairs right now, will you?

889
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:29,157
Don't...

890
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:30,782
Shut up.

891
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:33,085
Just shut up and listen to me.

892
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:34,726
Okay, sorry.

893
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:39,663
Now, was you standing there
the whole time, Sonny?

894
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,264
I had to take a piss.

895
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:44,096
All right, where did you piss?

896
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,067
I went over there.

897
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:48,640
That corner? How come you didn't piss
in this corner?

898
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:50,871
I thought of that...

899
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:53,608
and then I thought,
no, I'd probably stink up the place.

900
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:55,979
What... Come on.

901
01:10:56,385 --> 01:10:57,909
That's twice today, isn't it?

902
01:10:58,487 --> 01:10:59,647
Twice today, what?

903
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:03,349
- Twice your little dick got us into trouble.
- Come on.

904
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,793
No, don't.

905
01:11:06,962 --> 01:11:10,398
Come on, I'll do anything. I'm begging you.

906
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,700
Don't.

907
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:14,662
Fuck!

908
01:11:30,586 --> 01:11:31,951
That's gotta hurt.

909
01:11:59,848 --> 01:12:02,646
Sir, a couple of our snipers report hearing
a gunshot.

910
01:12:03,252 --> 01:12:05,550
- Outside?
- Definitely inside. Muffled.

911
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:07,313
- One single shot?
- That's right.

912
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,755
- Melanie?
- Maybe, if he's angry enough...

913
01:12:09,892 --> 01:12:11,359
to give up even more leverage.

914
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,018
- You want me to get him?
- No.

915
01:12:13,128 --> 01:12:15,756
I'm not gonna talk to him anymore,
we'll use Det. Foster.

916
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:18,025
- I'm ready, sir.
- Not now.

917
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:20,262
He's got to call us.

918
01:12:21,203 --> 01:12:24,798
All right, we'll make no moves at all.
No activity anywhere that he can see...

919
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:27,705
and we initiate no conversations, period.

920
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:30,037
We wait him out.

921
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:32,004
Sir, he can wait a long time.

922
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:33,575
So can I.

923
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:27,797
This far upstate,
we just don't see men like that.

924
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:30,000
Unfortunately, we do in Pittsburgh.

925
01:13:30,272 --> 01:13:31,671
This very one, in fact.

926
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:34,808
How the hell did you get him to surrender?

927
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:37,570
I just kept him on the phone
long enough, I guess.

928
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:39,476
No concessions, rewards?

929
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:43,417
I promised I'd fuck him.

930
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:48,714
That one I haven't tried.

931
01:13:56,865 --> 01:14:00,892
They did escape from a federal institution,
however the murders were committed...

932
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:04,865
Marks.

933
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:11,144
Thank God. I started to think you'd...

934
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:14,411
No. Don't worry about that.

935
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:16,449
I'm staying close.

936
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:40,001
Fuck this.

937
01:15:53,515 --> 01:15:54,573
Downlink!

938
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:56,818
No.

939
01:16:07,863 --> 01:16:09,296
<i>I hope you're happy, Jack.</i>

940
01:16:09,932 --> 01:16:11,559
'Cause you sure made your point.

941
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:18,836
It's not Mr. Potter, Ted. It's Sharon Foster.
Remember me?

942
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:24,678
Yeah, of course I do, darling.

943
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,209
You still owe me a piece of ass.

944
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:28,874
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

945
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:32,049
I'm just passing by,
heard you were up to your old tricks.

946
01:16:32,554 --> 01:16:34,749
<i>Not me, I was just up all night...</i>

947
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:38,053
and twiddling my thumbs
and biding my time.

948
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:39,521
So, what's shaking?

949
01:16:40,395 --> 01:16:43,762
I'm still with the PD, got promoted.
I'm a detective second now.

950
01:16:43,999 --> 01:16:44,966
<i>No shit.</i>

951
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:48,501
Yeah, I'm doing something with my life.
What are you doing with yours?

952
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:51,095
I'm very proud of my accomplishments,
actually.

953
01:16:51,373 --> 01:16:52,533
<i>You ought to be...</i>

954
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:54,698
cause you're a grade-A fuckup.

955
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:57,209
<i>Listen to you, girl.</i>

956
01:16:57,379 --> 01:17:00,280
You've been hanging around
too many cops, I'd say.

957
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:02,076
Let's talk, Ted.

958
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:03,946
<i>Sure, I'll talk. Make it quick.</i>

959
01:17:04,052 --> 01:17:06,247
<i>Gotta make a deal with Potter
for that chopper.</i>

960
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:10,382
I wouldn't make any book on that...

961
01:17:10,492 --> 01:17:11,982
<i>if I were you.</i>

962
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:13,350
Why's that?

963
01:17:14,763 --> 01:17:16,128
You have no chips left.

964
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:20,928
For one thing, you're missing six hostages,
or didn't you notice?

965
01:17:21,737 --> 01:17:22,931
Yeah, I know that.

966
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:26,373
But I still got the two ladies
over there sleeping, tied up.

967
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:29,403
Who cares?

968
01:17:31,613 --> 01:17:33,706
Yeah, but it's not the same.

969
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:36,416
You see, when you had the kids,
you had real juice.

970
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:38,713
But now with a couple grown women...

971
01:17:39,554 --> 01:17:40,680
I don't know, Ted.

972
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:43,348
<i>What I'm trying to say is if things heat up...</i>

973
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:45,449
<i>they could get expendable real quick.</i>

974
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,721
Fuck off. Let me talk to Potter right now.

975
01:17:50,432 --> 01:17:51,456
He's not here.

976
01:17:51,566 --> 01:17:54,126
Just go and fucking find him, then.

977
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:56,431
If I don't get that chopper here
in 10 minutes...

978
01:17:56,538 --> 01:17:59,234
<i>I'm gonna shoot myself
a couple of ladies dead.</i>

979
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:02,902
That's fucking brilliant,
you must've thought that one through.

980
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:05,479
You dumb fucking asshole,
if you kill those ladies...

981
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:09,175
these guys will lay a shit storm on you
so fast, you won't know what hit you.

982
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:11,514
You better face it,
even if you got the chopper...

983
01:18:11,653 --> 01:18:14,486
they'll drag you back
and stick a needle in your vein.

984
01:18:14,589 --> 01:18:16,557
Now, how does that sound?

985
01:18:16,925 --> 01:18:19,359
<i>That's something to look forward to,
isn't it, baby?</i>

986
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:20,461
Yeah.

987
01:18:21,496 --> 01:18:22,895
I don't want no needle.

988
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:24,658
That never has to happen, Ted.

989
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:26,058
My ass.

990
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:28,096
Now, you listen to me...

991
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:30,235
I'm telling you the truth.

992
01:18:30,772 --> 01:18:32,740
<i>You make a deal now or you'll die today.</i>

993
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:35,570
Hold on a second.

994
01:18:36,311 --> 01:18:37,278
Now what?

995
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,610
Who could guarantee the State won't
seek the death penalty?

996
01:18:42,084 --> 01:18:43,244
I suppose Marks could.

997
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:44,976
- Where is he?
- He's outside.

998
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:48,784
Spent the night in the media tent,
after having his picture taken with the kids.

999
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:50,858
- That figures. Get him in here.
- Right.

1000
01:18:52,828 --> 01:18:55,262
I think we may be able
to work something out here.

1001
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:56,597
Listen, baby...

1002
01:18:56,698 --> 01:18:59,861
while they're checking, why don't you
come in here and sit on my dick?

1003
01:18:59,968 --> 01:19:02,232
I would, Ted, you know I would.

1004
01:19:02,337 --> 01:19:03,770
But I don't know where it's been.

1005
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:07,636
<i>My dick? It's been in my pants
for an awful long time, unfortunately.</i>

1006
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:10,477
You just keep it there
just a little while longer.

1007
01:19:10,712 --> 01:19:11,906
He's gonna surrender?

1008
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,640
I think we can get him to,
if you'll put it on paper.

1009
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:20,048
Of course I will.

1010
01:19:25,627 --> 01:19:28,095
I have the State
Assistant Attorney General here.

1011
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:30,628
<i>He's guaranteeing they won't seek
the death penalty...</i>

1012
01:19:30,732 --> 01:19:33,394
if you surrender. Now, do we have a deal?

1013
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:36,801
No, we don't got a deal.
I wanna see it all writ out first.

1014
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:39,703
You will, we're gonna send it
to you right now.

1015
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:42,702
And, Ted, you're doing the right thing.

1016
01:19:57,025 --> 01:19:58,287
<i>- Yeah.
- Ted?</i>

1017
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:00,161
Hang on.

1018
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:04,425
<i>- Hello.
- So what do you think, Ted?</i>

1019
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:06,732
It's fine, except I don't see no mention
about my man, Shep Wilcox.

1020
01:20:06,767 --> 01:20:08,799
It's fine, except I don't see no mention
about my man, Shep Wilcox.

1021
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:12,533
<i>- He's a part of this.
- Absolutely, same deal. Bonner, too.</i>

1022
01:20:13,175 --> 01:20:16,076
You can forget about him.
He's not gonna be needing no paper.

1023
01:20:16,178 --> 01:20:17,543
Why is that?

1024
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:20,206
Poor little fellow
went and had himself an accident.

1025
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:25,147
That little redhead we got in here,
she went and bit his dick off.

1026
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:29,313
Mr. Potter just walked in.
He wants to talk to you.

1027
01:20:31,526 --> 01:20:34,461
Hey, Ted, I just heard the news.
You're doing the right thing.

1028
01:20:35,063 --> 01:20:37,827
Save the bullshit, will you, Jack?
What's the game plan now?

1029
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:42,460
Just a few ground rules. When I tell you,
put down your weapons...

1030
01:20:43,138 --> 01:20:46,505
step outside with your hands out
to your side, not on your head.

1031
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:50,636
It's like Christ on the cross.
It's a very nice image, isn't it?

1032
01:20:50,745 --> 01:20:51,939
How fitting.

1033
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:54,007
Listen, here's the deal.

1034
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:56,743
I want to see you. I want you up front.

1035
01:20:56,852 --> 01:21:00,720
<i>I want to know where you are.
That's the only way we're coming out.</i>

1036
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:05,151
I'll be there, five minutes.

1037
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:17,971
Sir, in case we get busy later,
I want to say...

1038
01:21:18,073 --> 01:21:19,734
it was a privilege working with you.

1039
01:21:19,841 --> 01:21:22,207
Likewise. You did a great job with him.

1040
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:26,076
- It was all you, sir. I just carried the mail.
- Nevertheless, great job.

1041
01:21:26,181 --> 01:21:27,273
Thank you.

1042
01:21:30,452 --> 01:21:32,079
<i>Time's up, Ted.</i>

1043
01:21:40,962 --> 01:21:43,590
Where are you, Jack? I can't see you.

1044
01:21:47,402 --> 01:21:49,063
Right here, Ted.

1045
01:21:59,781 --> 01:22:01,146
Come on out.

1046
01:22:05,487 --> 01:22:07,352
Now stretch your arms out.

1047
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:11,759
Stretch your arms out, now!

1048
01:22:13,795 --> 01:22:14,955
Do it.

1049
01:22:15,063 --> 01:22:18,260
Okay, Jack, take it easy.
You're gonna have a fucking heart attack.

1050
01:22:18,366 --> 01:22:20,596
Step forward, five feet.

1051
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:24,197
On your face, do it.

1052
01:22:25,073 --> 01:22:29,407
- On your face, now!
- All right, man, you're the boss.

1053
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:45,354
Hey, Jack.
What, not even gonna say hi to me?

1054
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:53,626
Hello, sweet cheeks,
I've been waiting for you.

1055
01:22:53,768 --> 01:22:55,736
How about that fuck now, baby?

1056
01:22:55,904 --> 01:22:57,667
You look terrific.

1057
01:23:01,276 --> 01:23:03,267
The building is clear, sir.

1058
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:49,747
Let's get you home.

1059
01:24:00,268 --> 01:24:02,498
Capt. Budd, this is Kelly at Airport Security.

1060
01:24:02,604 --> 01:24:05,437
We found a body in the ladies' room
broom closet, sir.

1061
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:07,804
<i>Could you get here right away?</i>

1062
01:24:08,476 --> 01:24:11,411
<i>Kelly, calm down, now.
You and Harris preserve the crime scene.</i>

1063
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:14,375
<i>- I'll get down there as quick as I can.
- Yes, sir.</i>

1064
01:24:19,254 --> 01:24:22,712
No, it's the least I can do for you fellows
for giving me a ride.

1065
01:24:23,191 --> 01:24:25,591
I hate those uniforms.

1066
01:24:26,027 --> 01:24:28,621
- Cream?
- Yes, in both, thanks.

1067
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:30,823
- Sugar?
- Yeah.

1068
01:24:31,466 --> 01:24:32,433
Great.

1069
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:36,134
Watch your step, honey.

1070
01:24:41,476 --> 01:24:43,205
- She's a trip.
- Yeah.

1071
01:24:48,283 --> 01:24:52,117
Hi. Can I borrow that towel, please?

1072
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:53,885
- That towel?
- Yeah.

1073
01:24:57,025 --> 01:24:58,583
Thank you.

1074
01:25:02,864 --> 01:25:04,388
Hey, look, man.

1075
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:07,928
Looks like your wish has come true, man.
Check it out.

1076
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:10,067
My wish.

1077
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:42,768
- Baby.
- Morning, fellows. Shep.

1078
01:25:43,071 --> 01:25:45,631
Take the keys, hands first.

1079
01:25:46,608 --> 01:25:49,941
- I did miss you.
- Easy.

1080
01:25:50,612 --> 01:25:52,603
- Let's go.
- Hands. This one down there.

1081
01:25:56,251 --> 01:25:57,912
I'm driving. Move over.

1082
01:25:58,019 --> 01:26:01,216
Get the way over, sweet cheeks, attagirl.

1083
01:26:06,861 --> 01:26:07,885
Shit.

1084
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:10,694
Jesus Christ!

1085
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:28,706
When was the body found?

1086
01:26:28,816 --> 01:26:30,579
It's about 15 minutes ago, sir.

1087
01:26:31,753 --> 01:26:33,880
Harris is in there with the body right now.

1088
01:26:34,255 --> 01:26:37,019
Sit down, son.
Put your head between your knees.

1089
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:38,557
Thank you, sir.

1090
01:26:40,628 --> 01:26:42,721
Looks to me like she got her neck broken.

1091
01:26:46,434 --> 01:26:49,164
Second stage rigor's set in.
It's room temperature.

1092
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:51,204
She's been dead about 12 hours.

1093
01:26:51,339 --> 01:26:54,001
She must have been locked
in the broom closet all night.

1094
01:26:54,108 --> 01:26:56,269
- You didn't touch anything, I hope.
- No, sir.

1095
01:26:56,377 --> 01:26:58,072
Would you all give us some room here now?

1096
01:26:58,179 --> 01:27:00,943
Everybody outside the door
until the crime lab gets here.

1097
01:27:10,124 --> 01:27:12,752
What is it?
You look as sick as young Kelly out there.

1098
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:14,487
That's a cop.

1099
01:27:14,696 --> 01:27:17,164
You see that? Right there?

1100
01:27:17,865 --> 01:27:20,527
You have the same worn spot on your belt.

1101
01:27:21,269 --> 01:27:23,237
Made by a handcuff case.

1102
01:27:26,507 --> 01:27:28,065
We've been had, Lenny.

1103
01:27:30,111 --> 01:27:33,979
Who knew that Sharon Foster was coming
into this airport yesterday?

1104
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:36,243
Just our people,
people on the command check.

1105
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:41,144
One of them tipped off Handy's girlfriend...

1106
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:43,720
that Foster was coming.

1107
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:46,925
- Excuse me, Handy's girlfriend?
- Yeah.

1108
01:27:47,028 --> 01:27:49,053
What's her name, Pris Gunder?

1109
01:27:49,163 --> 01:27:51,393
The one that got away
after the bank robbery?

1110
01:27:52,634 --> 01:27:55,797
Now, only a very close friend of Handy's...

1111
01:27:55,903 --> 01:27:58,337
can get away with pretending
to be Sharon Foster.

1112
01:27:58,906 --> 01:28:00,737
So, you're saying...

1113
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:03,970
That that is the body
of the real Sharon Foster.

1114
01:28:04,746 --> 01:28:08,011
- I find that hard to believe.
- So do I, but look.

1115
01:28:15,256 --> 01:28:16,746
God, you're right.

1116
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:19,923
- Christ.
- What?

1117
01:28:20,895 --> 01:28:23,625
Sharon Foster. Damn!

1118
01:28:24,098 --> 01:28:27,067
Pris Gunder, she wanted to get a ride back
to Pittsburgh.

1119
01:28:27,502 --> 01:28:30,471
She hitched a ride on the perp truck
going to Lewisburg.

1120
01:28:31,339 --> 01:28:32,465
Shit.

1121
01:28:37,845 --> 01:28:39,369
And both officers are down?

1122
01:28:39,747 --> 01:28:42,443
Yes, sir, one's dead
and the other one ain't far from it.

1123
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:43,983
There was a woman with them.

1124
01:28:44,385 --> 01:28:47,445
There is a woman down inside,
but she works here. No other woman.

1125
01:28:50,091 --> 01:28:52,992
All right. We'll be there
as soon as we take Melanie home.

1126
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:54,993
We don't have time, Lenny.

1127
01:28:55,096 --> 01:28:57,826
We got to get back to that slaughterhouse
where the money is.

1128
01:28:57,932 --> 01:29:00,992
- What's that?
- The money's in the slaughterhouse.

1129
01:29:01,369 --> 01:29:02,631
What money?

1130
01:29:02,737 --> 01:29:05,604
The $2,200,000
from the bank robbery in Pittsburgh.

1131
01:29:05,707 --> 01:29:09,234
That's where they were headed yesterday
morning when they hit that Cadillac.

1132
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:12,871
- But my man chased them in there.
- No, he didn't, Lenny, he followed them.

1133
01:29:41,509 --> 01:29:45,104
- Yeah, they're here. Get them moving.
- And no sirens.

1134
01:29:45,713 --> 01:29:49,171
Everyone remains in the staging area
until I call them forward.

1135
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:50,974
<i>- You hear that?
- Roger.</i>

1136
01:29:51,085 --> 01:29:52,552
Good. Get on it.

1137
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:55,386
Wait here. Lock the doors.

1138
01:29:56,724 --> 01:29:59,522
You'll be safe in the car.
The troopers are on their way.

1139
01:30:41,869 --> 01:30:45,361
It sure is a good thing I like you,
'cause I could plug you so easy...

1140
01:31:33,421 --> 01:31:35,446
Bullshit. Your share is your share.

1141
01:31:37,191 --> 01:31:39,352
Man, you're a tough bargainer, huh?

1142
01:31:39,627 --> 01:31:42,687
You know, it's like this all the time.
I'm getting dirty for you.

1143
01:31:42,797 --> 01:31:45,561
You're all down there,
prissy in your nice little suit.

1144
01:31:45,666 --> 01:31:50,569
Hey, I gave you a simple job.
The whole thing was laid out for you.

1145
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:54,198
You turned it into a goddamn bloodbath.

1146
01:31:55,009 --> 01:31:58,137
- Did I ask to get caught?
- You practically did.

1147
01:31:58,412 --> 01:32:00,846
What the hell were you doing anyway,
coming here?

1148
01:32:00,982 --> 01:32:04,782
Hey, Pris, come on in here
and listen to this, honey.

1149
01:32:05,052 --> 01:32:07,145
You're hearing all this shit, Pris?

1150
01:32:09,757 --> 01:32:13,818
Pris, I'm telling you,
Marks said I screwed up.

1151
01:32:14,061 --> 01:32:16,325
When have I ever screwed up, honey?

1152
01:32:17,064 --> 01:32:20,932
Pris, just answer me, baby. Where are you?

1153
01:32:28,743 --> 01:32:30,142
What are you doing?

1154
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:42,248
Hey, Pris, this fucker is gonna shoot me.

1155
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:45,458
She's as tired
of cleaning up after you as I am.

1156
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,250
Pris, honey!

1157
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:51,494
Don't move, Marks. Put the gun down.

1158
01:33:34,942 --> 01:33:36,204
Forgetting something?

1159
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:39,006
You were gonna let Marks shoot me
