1
00:22:20,621 --> 00:22:22,550
I WAS GONNA ASK HER TO MARRY ME

2
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:23,645
YOU KNOW?

3
00:22:28,483 --> 00:22:31,110
MERRY CHRISTMAS IN JULY, BABY

4
00:22:42,705 --> 00:22:44,123
THIS IS SO SPECIAL

5
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:53,341
YOU DO KNOW I WANT KIDS.

6
00:22:53,716 --> 00:22:54,874
OKAY NOT A TRUCK LOAD

7
00:22:54,926 --> 00:22:56,917
JUST ENOUGH TO FILL THE HOUSE WITH

8
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,012
CHEER

9
00:22:58,471 --> 00:22:59,253
LAUGHTER

10
00:22:59,305 --> 00:23:00,004
YOU KNOW...

11
00:23:00,056 --> 00:23:01,933
HOLD THAT THOUGHT

12
00:23:04,811 --> 00:23:05,760
WHAT'S THIS?

13
00:23:05,812 --> 00:23:06,854
OPEN IT

14
00:23:20,243 --> 00:23:21,567
PRINCESS ALICE ADOPTION HOME?

15
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:23,329
LOOK, WE CAN AFFORD ONE

16
00:23:23,955 --> 00:23:25,790
MAYBE TWO...

17
00:23:28,835 --> 00:23:30,253
THANK YOU SO MUCH

18
00:23:31,671 --> 00:23:33,131
THANK YOU SO MUCH

19
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,949
I NEED A HIT

20
00:24:45,078 --> 00:24:45,901
HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED?

21
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:46,996
A STRONG HIT

22
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:53,336
BUT SEE... I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY

23
00:24:54,671 --> 00:24:56,881
AH YOU'RE PLAYING GAMES, FUCK OFF

24
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,177
I REALLY NEED IT...

25
00:25:02,011 --> 00:25:03,429
PLEASE HELP ME

26
00:25:05,515 --> 00:25:06,891
YOU REALLY WANT IT?

27
00:25:41,384 --> 00:25:42,719
YOU'RE CROWDING UP MY SPACE

28
00:25:46,139 --> 00:25:48,641
YOU SEE, ACTUALLY, I'D
LIKE TO BUY SOME DRUGS

29
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:50,810
BUT...

30
00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:53,396
I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY

31
00:25:54,313 --> 00:25:58,609
THE GUYS DOWNSTAIRS SAID I COULD COME UP

32
00:26:01,154 --> 00:26:02,196
I HAVE A CAR

33
00:26:03,948 --> 00:26:05,283
YOU CAN HAVE IT

34
00:26:08,202 --> 00:26:11,330
I'M NOT A CAR DEALER, I DON'T NEED A CAR

35
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,387
BUT YOU CAN OFFER ME SOMETHING...

36
00:26:28,264 --> 00:26:29,307
SOMETHING?

37
00:26:37,106 --> 00:26:38,232
SURE

38
00:26:52,163 --> 00:26:53,539
WHERE THE DRUGS?

39
00:26:53,956 --> 00:26:55,249
IT'S IN MY POCKET

40
00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:01,631
I'M A MAN OF MY WORDS

41
00:27:02,131 --> 00:27:03,174
TRUST ME

42
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,763
I NEED TO FORGET

43
00:27:09,931 --> 00:27:11,682
AND THESE DRUGS, THEY HELP YOU?

44
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:13,476
FORGET

45
00:27:15,728 --> 00:27:17,021
SO WHY NOT USE ALCOHOL?

46
00:27:17,647 --> 00:27:18,731
TOO SLOW

47
00:27:21,317 --> 00:27:23,486
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO FORGET

48
00:27:25,863 --> 00:27:26,906
I THINK

49
00:27:27,365 --> 00:27:28,908
I THINK YOU WANT TO REMEMBER

50
00:27:30,993 --> 00:27:33,079
WHY...? WHY RELIVE SUCH?

51
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,122
I'M NOT

52
00:27:36,123 --> 00:27:37,166
I'M NOT

53
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,584
BUT WHY...? I MEAN...

54
00:27:38,709 --> 00:27:39,752
DO YOU...

55
00:27:41,796 --> 00:27:42,839
YOU ENJOY IT?

56
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:46,342
WHY WOULD I ENJOY IT?

57
00:27:51,347 --> 00:27:53,808
YOU KNOW THE RULES

58
00:28:03,067 --> 00:28:05,100
ARE YOU TRYING TO PUNISH YOURSELF?

59
00:28:05,152 --> 00:28:06,821
FOR NOT SAVING HER?

60
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:13,119
A DECORATED OFFICER LIKE YOURSELF

61
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,999
YOU WERE USELESS TO SAVE HER

62
00:28:21,502 --> 00:28:22,545
AND THESE DRUGS...

63
00:28:23,129 --> 00:28:24,380
THESE DRUGS, THEY'RE...

64
00:28:24,547 --> 00:28:26,340
TO REPLAY IT

65
00:28:27,633 --> 00:28:28,885
LIKE A REMOTE

66
00:28:29,218 --> 00:28:30,553
REWIND IN TIME

67
00:28:31,846 --> 00:28:33,180
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T SAVE HER

68
00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:36,350
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE FOR

69
00:28:44,901 --> 00:28:46,611
I NEED TO SEE HER

70
00:29:19,852 --> 00:29:20,895
NO!

71
00:29:21,187 --> 00:29:22,229
NO! NO!

72
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:26,442
I'll FIX THIS

73
00:29:27,026 --> 00:29:27,777
I'll FIX THIS

74
00:29:27,944 --> 00:29:28,986
I'll FIX THIS.

75
00:29:32,031 --> 00:29:34,033
NO! NO! NO!

76
00:30:01,936 --> 00:30:05,356
YOU SHOULD HAVE NEVER TOUCHED HER!

77
00:31:49,585 --> 00:31:51,045
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

78
00:31:52,463 --> 00:31:54,788
AND THEN LOOK HOW THEY LEFT IT

79
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,842
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

80
00:33:29,476 --> 00:33:31,854
YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST LET YOUR
COLLEAGUES TAKE CARE OF IT

81
00:33:34,023 --> 00:33:35,691
THEY WERE NEVER GONNA SOLVE IT

82
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:41,864
HAD TO DO IT MYSELF

83
00:33:45,534 --> 00:33:51,165
AND I FOUND EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM

84
00:33:55,085 --> 00:34:00,174
AND WHAT DID YOU DO WHEN YOU FOUND THEM?

85
00:34:04,595 --> 00:34:07,389
I KILLED THEM

86
00:34:11,477 --> 00:34:12,519
LOOK

87
00:34:18,317 --> 00:34:19,558
PALESA IS GONE

88
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,570
SHE CAN REST IN PEACE NOW

89
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,866
IT IS...

90
00:34:26,242 --> 00:34:27,368
OVER

91
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:32,081
EXCEPT

92
00:34:34,124 --> 00:34:35,459
EXCEPT FOR ONE!

93
00:34:40,881 --> 00:34:42,091
I CAN'T

94
00:34:42,716 --> 00:34:43,926
LET YOU GO

95
00:34:45,803 --> 00:34:48,097
I'M NOT DONE YET

96
00:35:13,747 --> 00:35:15,332
I FOUND THEM ALL

97
00:35:22,548 --> 00:35:24,842
WE CAN HAVE AS MANY KIDS AS YOU WANT

98
00:35:33,934 --> 00:35:35,269
COME WITH ME

99
00:35:35,853 --> 00:35:37,646
COME... COME WITH ME

100
00:36:58,998 --> 00:37:00,041
I got it.

101
00:37:00,145 --> 00:37:01,480
I think we need tools.

102
00:37:01,814 --> 00:37:05,442
When Stevie and Large's
favorite courts are frozen over...

103
00:37:05,651 --> 00:37:09,321
When life gives you ice...
You make... a basketball hoop.

104
00:37:30,259 --> 00:37:34,012
Ah, something very interesting
is happening with the wild Stevie.

105
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:39,852
This male specimen is Justin Tyler,
also known as the new kid on the block,

106
00:37:39,977 --> 00:37:46,442
also known as my cousin from Michigan,
also known as just moved here last week.

107
00:37:46,525 --> 00:37:47,568
Let's observe.

108
00:37:56,743 --> 00:37:57,786
Yeah, that's cool.

109
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,537
Yeah?

110
00:37:58,829 --> 00:37:59,872
What's cool?

111
00:38:01,123 --> 00:38:04,460
Nothing, man.
So I'll see you tomorrow, then.

112
00:38:06,462 --> 00:38:08,630
Great. Later.

113
00:38:11,467 --> 00:38:12,509
What was that?

114
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:17,931
Nothing. He just wants to hang.

115
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,434
OK, cool, where we hanging?

116
00:38:21,894 --> 00:38:24,062
I think it's like... just me.

117
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:30,736
Oh! Oh! This is a very interesting
day for Stevie, everyone.

118
00:38:30,861 --> 00:38:32,946
She is going... on a date.

119
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,655
It's not -

120
00:38:34,072 --> 00:38:36,074
Yo, so are you going to
let him touch your butt,

121
00:38:36,158 --> 00:38:38,994
because I heard that people
from Michigan can be very forward.

122
00:38:40,037 --> 00:38:41,079
I swear to God.

123
00:38:41,997 --> 00:38:46,168
OK, OK, OK. I'll stop. I'll stop.
Just guard your butt.

124
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,223
Hold still.

125
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,183
Sorry.

126
00:39:03,685 --> 00:39:05,771
Does it have to be so hard?

127
00:39:05,979 --> 00:39:07,147
I'm not doing it hard.

128
00:39:08,398 --> 00:39:10,400
You know you could be
so cute if you just tried.

129
00:39:11,944 --> 00:39:12,986
Thank you.

130
00:39:17,991 --> 00:39:19,326
OK, that's my eyeball.

131
00:39:19,451 --> 00:39:21,620
It's called eyeliner, yes.

132
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:29,962
I cannot believe you are going on a date.

133
00:39:30,879 --> 00:39:32,965
Can you stop calling it that?

134
00:39:33,006 --> 00:39:35,092
Well is anyone else going to be there?

135
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,052
No - I don't know.

136
00:39:37,469 --> 00:39:39,137
Then it's a date, Steve.

137
00:39:43,225 --> 00:39:49,565
Just laugh at his jokes, and
touch your hair a lot. It'll be great.

138
00:39:53,944 --> 00:39:58,949
Oh my god!
I am so incredibly talented.

139
00:39:59,575 --> 00:40:03,036
Steve! You look so hot!

140
00:40:05,497 --> 00:40:10,002
Now, this.

141
00:40:12,879 --> 00:40:13,922
I'm not wearing that.

142
00:40:32,316 --> 00:40:33,358
Hi.

143
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,610
Hi.

144
00:40:34,818 --> 00:40:40,032
You must be Stevie!
I'm Angie, Justin's sister.

145
00:40:40,866 --> 00:40:42,117
Welcome to the neighborhood.

146
00:40:43,785 --> 00:40:44,828
Thank you.

147
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:50,792
Are you OK?

148
00:40:51,084 --> 00:40:54,963
Yeah! He'll be right out.

149
00:40:56,423 --> 00:40:57,466
OK.

150
00:40:59,968 --> 00:41:01,011
Nice shirt.

151
00:41:04,848 --> 00:41:09,353
Hey. You ready to go? Later, Spangela.

152
00:41:09,561 --> 00:41:10,604
Bye.

153
00:41:12,856 --> 00:41:13,899
Cool shirt.

154
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:29,247
Are you sure you don't want to go to
that Italian place? I made a reservation.

155
00:41:30,582 --> 00:41:31,625
A what?

156
00:41:32,084 --> 00:41:34,252
A reservation. At the Italian place.

157
00:41:35,087 --> 00:41:38,090
Oh, that's OK, my sister barfed there once.

158
00:41:39,883 --> 00:41:40,926
Thanks for the warning.

159
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:53,230
OK, holding, right?
I'm sorry, this is the playoffs.

160
00:41:53,647 --> 00:41:55,941
Hey, playoffs.

161
00:41:59,236 --> 00:42:01,571
What's up, guys? Yo!

162
00:42:01,697 --> 00:42:01,988
Yo!

163
00:42:02,114 --> 00:42:04,282
Niners game? Awesome.

164
00:42:07,327 --> 00:42:08,370
What are you doing?

165
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:10,455
The game.

166
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,586
Are you wearing make-up?

167
00:42:18,004 --> 00:42:19,047
What are you wearing?

168
00:42:19,089 --> 00:42:20,132
Nothing.

169
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:20,966
Ew!

170
00:42:21,049 --> 00:42:21,508
Stop.

171
00:42:21,591 --> 00:42:22,217
Look at that!

172
00:42:22,342 --> 00:42:23,385
I'm getting a refill.

173
00:42:26,805 --> 00:42:27,973
Well she looks weird.

174
00:42:29,307 --> 00:42:33,186
Dude, what the hell?
You just crash people's dates all the time?

175
00:42:33,895 --> 00:42:35,897
Yeah, it's what I do instead of drugs.

176
00:42:37,858 --> 00:42:41,820
OK, I'll lay off.
It's the only bar in town.

177
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:45,073
Dartboard's open.

178
00:42:52,122 --> 00:42:57,377
See, it's your form. It's like,
totally off. T's a push not a throw.

179
00:42:57,794 --> 00:42:59,087
It's not baseball.

180
00:42:59,546 --> 00:43:01,423
OK. Show me.

181
00:43:03,717 --> 00:43:05,385
So... arm...

182
00:43:08,013 --> 00:43:09,055
- Push?
- Yeah.

183
00:43:10,724 --> 00:43:14,770
OK. Alright, I'll give it a whirl.

184
00:43:19,858 --> 00:43:20,400
See?

185
00:43:20,484 --> 00:43:23,236
Woohoo! Yeah!

186
00:43:23,278 --> 00:43:24,571
Nice one brother!

187
00:43:25,113 --> 00:43:28,241
Jesus, what are you doing here?

188
00:43:28,533 --> 00:43:32,412
I wanted to watch the game.
And cable not installed yet so...

189
00:43:34,289 --> 00:43:37,417
We gonna play this game, or we gonna
stand around like a bunch of sissies?

190
00:43:38,835 --> 00:43:39,878
Be my guest.

191
00:43:48,887 --> 00:43:51,389
Whoa. She's better than you, Stevie.

192
00:44:34,724 --> 00:44:35,767
You OK?

193
00:44:46,111 --> 00:44:48,321
Still our turn, still our turn.

194
00:45:07,799 --> 00:45:08,842
You OK?

195
00:45:10,093 --> 00:45:11,136
Yeah.

196
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:14,472
What was in that?

197
00:45:16,683 --> 00:45:17,726
Tequila.

198
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,478
Oh. That makes sense.

199
00:45:30,238 --> 00:45:35,660
So, Stevie.
Is that like, after Stevie Nicks?

200
00:45:36,536 --> 00:45:40,540
No, it's short for Stephanie.

201
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,379
Hm. OK. Stephanie.

202
00:45:46,796 --> 00:45:48,173
Don't ever call me that.

203
00:45:49,007 --> 00:45:52,385
Woo! OK then! Touchy.

204
00:45:54,012 --> 00:45:55,764
Hey, um, can I ask you something?

205
00:45:58,266 --> 00:45:59,309
Shoot.

206
00:46:00,352 --> 00:46:02,938
What happened? With your leg?

207
00:46:04,648 --> 00:46:09,861
This thing... I played college ball.

208
00:46:10,528 --> 00:46:15,367
And the second-to-last game of my
senior season, I tore my achilles in half.

209
00:46:18,203 --> 00:46:26,544
Two years and two surgeries
later, here I am. Ended my career.

210
00:46:28,713 --> 00:46:29,756
You played basketball?

211
00:46:32,258 --> 00:46:33,426
I played a little.

212
00:46:37,472 --> 00:46:44,479
God, I can't imagine...
not being able to play,

213
00:46:44,521 --> 00:46:48,942
I mean, sometimes I think,
it's the only thing I have.

214
00:46:56,658 --> 00:46:57,701
I wouldn't say that.

215
00:47:02,205 --> 00:47:09,295
Yo! Hey, we gotta go, Large found
the karaoke machine. It's not good.

216
00:47:09,504 --> 00:47:12,090
Yo, Large, no one likes that song!

217
00:47:12,215 --> 00:47:14,175
Are you guys ready for this shit!

218
00:47:18,555 --> 00:47:20,724
Yeah, like, two years on these crutches.

219
00:47:20,765 --> 00:47:21,349
What?

220
00:47:21,391 --> 00:47:24,060
She's better on them then she is off...
Are you OK?

221
00:47:24,394 --> 00:47:25,895
You're gonna need crutches yourself.

222
00:47:25,979 --> 00:47:27,022
Oh... no.

223
00:47:29,733 --> 00:47:30,859
Wait, wait, Stevie.

224
00:47:32,736 --> 00:47:34,112
I had a really good time tonight.

225
00:47:35,363 --> 00:47:36,823
Me... me too.

226
00:47:36,865 --> 00:47:43,288
I mean, other than the fact that you handed me my ass
at almost every competitive activity we played today.

227
00:47:45,248 --> 00:47:46,416
I did that?

228
00:47:46,499 --> 00:47:47,834
Yeah, a little bit.

229
00:47:49,836 --> 00:47:54,758
I'm sorry, I - I just forget to let
people win sometimes... It's like a...

230
00:47:56,217 --> 00:47:57,260
I'll forgive you.

231
00:48:05,602 --> 00:48:06,644
Was that OK?

232
00:48:26,748 --> 00:48:27,791
Goodnight, Stevie.

233
00:48:35,632 --> 00:48:36,758
What are you doing up?

234
00:48:37,592 --> 00:48:38,843
What happened?

235
00:48:40,428 --> 00:48:41,471
Nothing.

236
00:48:42,806 --> 00:48:44,390
He kissed you, I saw!

237
00:48:44,682 --> 00:48:46,059
Were you watching?

238
00:48:48,019 --> 00:48:50,230
Yes, it was amazing,
are you going to see him again?

239
00:48:52,899 --> 00:48:53,942
I don't know.

240
00:48:54,275 --> 00:48:58,780
You have to see him again. Steve,
this is like, so amazing, you have no idea.

241
00:48:58,822 --> 00:49:00,240
Why do you care so much?

242
00:49:00,448 --> 00:49:02,967
Because, Steve, everyone thinks
you're like a lesbian or something

243
00:49:02,992 --> 00:49:06,371
and honestly it's getting really annoying,
everyone talking about it all the time!

244
00:49:12,836 --> 00:49:16,923
I'm sorry, they - they what?

245
00:49:24,097 --> 00:49:25,557
Steve, I told them you weren't.

246
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:11,019
C'mon, O'Hara!

247
00:50:14,564 --> 00:50:15,607
So, we hangin' out later?

248
00:50:17,192 --> 00:50:18,234
Sure.

249
00:50:18,443 --> 00:50:20,570
I was thinking Monopoly?
I'll let you be the banker.

250
00:50:21,779 --> 00:50:22,822
Let's play the game.

251
00:50:23,489 --> 00:50:24,532
OK.

252
00:50:30,413 --> 00:50:31,456
I'm out.

253
00:50:32,498 --> 00:50:33,750
Let me take a look at it.

254
00:50:37,712 --> 00:50:38,938
Yeah, I think it's gonna be OK.

255
00:50:38,963 --> 00:50:40,006
I'll survive.

256
00:50:42,717 --> 00:50:44,093
You coming to Owen's for lunch?

257
00:50:44,802 --> 00:50:46,888
No, I'm going to get a couple of shots in.

258
00:50:52,727 --> 00:50:53,770
You sure you're OK?

259
00:50:56,064 --> 00:51:00,026
Yeah, I'm fine, really.
You should go with them.

260
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,363
OK.

261
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:07,325
I'll see you later though, yeah?

262
00:51:09,619 --> 00:51:10,662
Yo guys, wait up!

263
00:51:39,148 --> 00:51:40,191
Wow.

264
00:51:42,277 --> 00:51:44,946
Hey, didn't see you there.

265
00:51:46,406 --> 00:51:49,784
Your sister told me where I could find you.
Cute kid.

266
00:51:51,661 --> 00:51:53,746
Here, let me see it.

267
00:51:55,206 --> 00:51:56,249
C'mon!

268
00:52:00,211 --> 00:52:01,879
You alright?
I saw you limping earlier?

269
00:52:03,631 --> 00:52:04,799
I'm alright.

270
00:52:06,759 --> 00:52:07,969
Who's the gimp now?

271
00:52:08,845 --> 00:52:11,222
Yeah, we're a sad pair, aren't we?

272
00:52:12,974 --> 00:52:14,809
Show me your best trick shot.

273
00:52:16,686 --> 00:52:17,770
I don't have a trick shot.

274
00:52:19,897 --> 00:52:23,026
OK, boring. I'll teach you mine.

275
00:52:23,943 --> 00:52:26,779
It's called The Crazy Susan.
It was my shot in college.

276
00:52:27,113 --> 00:52:28,364
Top of the key. Come on.

277
00:52:31,284 --> 00:52:33,953
Face away.
Away from the basket. Alright.

278
00:52:36,331 --> 00:52:37,373
Close your eyes.

279
00:52:40,877 --> 00:52:41,919
I'm gonna spin you.

280
00:52:48,885 --> 00:52:52,138
Your back is to the basket.
Shoot.

281
00:52:55,266 --> 00:52:57,018
Close your eyes! Cheater.

282
00:53:04,525 --> 00:53:06,110
Oh my god.

283
00:53:06,527 --> 00:53:07,570
It went in?

284
00:53:08,821 --> 00:53:11,324
Yeah. Shit.

285
00:53:11,991 --> 00:53:12,867
It went in!

286
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:13,618
Well done.

287
00:53:13,826 --> 00:53:16,412
That's The Crazy Susan?
It's not that crazy.

288
00:53:16,496 --> 00:53:17,580
Very nice.

289
00:53:18,414 --> 00:53:19,540
I'm gonna take this now.

290
00:53:19,749 --> 00:53:21,125
No, I need that actually.

291
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,718
I'm sorry... I have no idea what that was.

292
00:53:30,802 --> 00:53:34,514
It's OK... my brother.

293
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:39,352
Right.

294
00:53:40,728 --> 00:53:41,771
You like him.

295
00:53:45,817 --> 00:53:48,861
We'd fight over girls, but I would never...

296
00:53:51,781 --> 00:53:56,994
No, I get it, I'm... I'm sorry.

297
00:53:59,997 --> 00:54:05,420
Don't be. Trust me. OK?

298
00:54:08,339 --> 00:54:09,382
OK.

299
00:54:11,384 --> 00:54:12,427
OK?

300
00:55:40,744 --> 00:55:41,974
Flo, really?

301
00:55:42,517 --> 00:55:46,145
You're outside drinking?
Please get rid of the bottle.

302
00:55:51,692 --> 00:55:53,444
It's not fine at all!

303
00:56:03,871 --> 00:56:08,876
And uh, also a pint.
Can I get a pint please?

304
00:56:09,001 --> 00:56:10,044
Got it.

305
00:56:14,632 --> 00:56:15,883
What, why is that funny?

306
00:56:17,134 --> 00:56:18,177
A pint?

307
00:56:18,886 --> 00:56:19,512
A pint.

308
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,348
You can't order a pint here...

309
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,059
I don't want to get a
small beer. I want a..pint.

310
00:56:25,142 --> 00:56:26,185
Medium.

311
00:56:26,811 --> 00:56:27,645
A medium?

312
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:28,813
Medium beer.

313
00:56:29,105 --> 00:56:32,024
That's a pint. This is a
pint glass, by the way.

314
00:56:32,233 --> 00:56:32,984
Yeah?

315
00:56:33,067 --> 00:56:34,110
Yeah.

316
00:56:56,966 --> 00:56:58,009
Finally.

317
00:57:25,202 --> 00:57:26,037
Hi.

318
00:57:26,245 --> 00:57:27,288
Hi.

319
00:57:36,589 --> 00:57:39,091
I can only give you a
passing grade on this.

320
00:57:40,551 --> 00:57:41,677
Why?

321
00:57:42,928 --> 00:57:47,099
I mean, Flo - You didn't
follow the assignment.

322
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:49,727
You don't care though.

323
00:57:50,227 --> 00:57:54,190
No, I suppose I didn't exactly...

324
00:57:54,398 --> 00:57:56,484
The assignment was on Kafka!

325
00:57:58,277 --> 00:58:01,697
You wrote about the
predetermined behaviors of insects...

326
00:58:02,948 --> 00:58:06,410
And their lack of a
decision making process.

327
00:58:08,371 --> 00:58:11,499
It's purely primal. Can you imagine?

328
00:58:12,875 --> 00:58:14,126
Sometimes.

329
00:58:18,089 --> 00:58:20,383
Shit. Hi Florence.

330
00:58:22,051 --> 00:58:25,680
I will see you at the party. Okay.

331
00:58:27,765 --> 00:58:28,808
Faculty Party.

332
00:58:29,558 --> 00:58:31,936
Ah, grown-up time.

333
00:58:33,312 --> 00:58:35,064
No, there will be some students.

334
00:58:36,941 --> 00:58:37,983
Come.

335
00:58:55,418 --> 00:58:56,127
How's it going?

336
00:58:56,252 --> 00:58:57,294
Good!

337
00:59:00,506 --> 00:59:02,174
I'm a bit underdressed, but-

338
00:59:02,383 --> 00:59:03,426
No, you're fine.

339
00:59:18,566 --> 00:59:19,692
Oh, okay.

340
00:59:30,327 --> 00:59:31,370
Hi Alex!

341
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:34,290
Hi!

342
00:59:36,584 --> 00:59:37,626
Excuse-me.

343
01:00:16,207 --> 01:00:17,458
Hello Florence.

344
01:00:19,335 --> 01:00:21,212
I'm so glad you could make it.

345
01:00:21,337 --> 01:00:22,463
Thank you.

346
01:00:23,297 --> 01:00:25,174
So what do you think of my humble abode?

347
01:00:25,382 --> 01:00:26,967
It's really lovely, yeah.

348
01:00:27,468 --> 01:00:29,762
You know the rug is from the Masada...

349
01:00:30,805 --> 01:00:32,890
Don't, don't step on it.

350
01:00:33,933 --> 01:00:35,184
- It's sacred.
- Okay.

351
01:00:35,601 --> 01:00:38,103
But my favorite piece is the mandala.

352
01:00:39,146 --> 01:00:41,440
Tibetan. We carried it over the Hima...

353
01:00:41,565 --> 01:00:46,362
Well... The Sherpas carried it
over the Himalayas. Near to Nepal.

354
01:00:46,445 --> 01:00:49,073
They weren't too happy about it.

355
01:00:49,573 --> 01:00:52,201
It's really beautiful. So nice.

356
01:00:52,701 --> 01:00:54,787
Yeah. That's really nice.

357
01:00:58,749 --> 01:01:03,128
Well, enjoy your evening.

358
01:01:06,048 --> 01:01:07,091
Thanks.

359
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,191
This is weird.

360
01:01:25,025 --> 01:01:26,068
I know.

361
01:01:30,155 --> 01:01:31,198
Wait, I...

362
01:01:38,289 --> 01:01:39,623
I like you.

363
01:01:41,292 --> 01:01:42,334
Don't.

364
01:01:42,668 --> 01:01:43,711
I do.

365
01:01:48,507 --> 01:01:49,550
The way you think.

366
01:01:52,761 --> 01:01:56,515
The way you talk to
people, even stupid people.

367
01:01:58,809 --> 01:02:01,020
They always feel like the
only person in the room.

368
01:02:19,038 --> 01:02:20,080
I can't.

369
01:03:36,407 --> 01:03:37,992
We can't do this here.

370
01:04:03,517 --> 01:04:05,102
Yeah, hi!

371
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:06,437
Hi!

372
01:04:06,562 --> 01:04:07,896
You look a little pekid.

373
01:04:08,105 --> 01:04:09,148
A little?

374
01:04:09,356 --> 01:04:11,025
- Pekid.
- Pekid!

375
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:12,901
- Pale.
- Oh! Yeah.

376
01:04:14,778 --> 01:04:16,030
Too much to drink?

377
01:04:16,155 --> 01:04:17,197
Uh? No.

378
01:04:17,614 --> 01:04:19,700
Not enough?

379
01:04:19,992 --> 01:04:22,286
You want something? Beer, Wine?

380
01:04:24,788 --> 01:04:25,831
Both?

381
01:04:32,713 --> 01:04:38,969
Uh yeah I'm... Can you excuse me a second?
I'm sorry I need to use the bathroom.

382
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:52,292
Hi.

383
01:05:52,709 --> 01:05:53,752
Hi.

384
01:06:22,948 --> 01:06:25,117
I thought we could get a cup of coffee.

385
01:06:25,742 --> 01:06:27,411
I'm sorry I can't.

386
01:06:29,204 --> 01:06:30,247
But-

387
01:06:30,873 --> 01:06:32,624
I can't do that.

388
01:06:42,843 --> 01:06:44,094
You need to leave.

389
01:06:51,393 --> 01:06:53,426
I'm sorry, why are you doing this?

390
01:06:53,478 --> 01:07:01,820
[No dialogue]

391
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:20,311
Hello stranger.

392
01:22:22,396 --> 01:22:26,066
And what in god's name have you been up to,
to be calling me at this time in the morning?

393
01:22:26,254 --> 01:22:29,695
I'm innocent I swear,
just on my way home...

394
01:22:31,415 --> 01:22:34,179
I heard the news, you okay babe?

395
01:22:34,804 --> 01:22:36,890
Yeah... I'm fine, thank you.

396
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:38,662
Yeah? And that cunt of an ex?

397
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:40,289
She playing the martyr again?

398
01:22:40,331 --> 01:22:41,061
Behave.

399
01:22:41,269 --> 01:22:44,814
God, I fucking hate her,
I've always hated her Chris...

400
01:22:45,753 --> 01:22:49,194
I know you loved that twat
but she's a psycho bitch...

401
01:22:49,611 --> 01:22:50,653
You're better off.

402
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:52,801
Listen, don't hold back
on my account Mikey.

403
01:22:52,947 --> 01:22:54,720
You know, say what you really think.

404
01:22:55,033 --> 01:22:57,952
So when are you coming to see me again?

405
01:22:58,057 --> 01:22:59,648
- We'll have a laugh, few drinks...?
- I don't know.

406
01:22:59,673 --> 01:23:02,019
I've got loads of work
to do and I'm pretty skint.

407
01:23:02,436 --> 01:23:06,190
Me too.
I'm in the motor trade now y'know?

408
01:23:06,398 --> 01:23:07,962
Oh yeah, doing what?

409
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:12,759
Washing cars!
You need cheering up babe.

410
01:23:13,176 --> 01:23:20,058
C'mon leave that town full of sour-faced,
clam-smackers and come see me!

411
01:24:19,232 --> 01:24:20,979
[Telephone rings, voice
answers]: ' Chrissy!”

412
01:24:21,004 --> 01:24:22,985
So am I going to get this drink or what?

413
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:29,189
Oh my god, you've still got it?

414
01:24:33,829 --> 01:24:37,114
Right Chrissy, let's get wasted.

415
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:50,148
So Chris, you thought about
making this more permanent?

416
01:24:50,617 --> 01:24:54,006
My head's too messed up to think
about moving right now to be honest.

417
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:56,978
And I've already kind of done Brighton?

418
01:25:05,267 --> 01:25:07,353
It's fucking good to see you, Chrissy.

419
01:25:08,082 --> 01:25:10,585
I'd forgotten how fucking funny you were.

420
01:25:17,363 --> 01:25:22,263
I've forgotten what a shag feels
like but still, that's good to hear.

421
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:27,216
Hey, I lost track of the women you had
when we lived together.

422
01:25:27,998 --> 01:25:30,344
That was ten years ago.

423
01:25:32,273 --> 01:25:35,610
I've got saggy tits now,
who's gonna want me?

424
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:41,553
Bollocks to that, you
always had paper tits.

425
01:25:43,743 --> 01:25:48,331
Seriously Chrissy you
can pull any bird you like.

426
01:25:49,843 --> 01:25:52,293
I've been thinking
about a librarian recently.

427
01:25:52,502 --> 01:25:56,360
You know, less talking... More fingers.

428
01:25:56,777 --> 01:25:59,905
You'll be lucky in here
if the dykes can read!

429
01:27:16,961 --> 01:27:18,108
Is everything alright?

430
01:27:19,776 --> 01:27:22,070
Yeah Deb, it's fine.

431
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:27,180
It's Jaz.

432
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:57,418
Look, I'm …I'm just gonna go.

433
01:27:57,627 --> 01:28:00,442
No no, it's fine, it's fine.. Ok.

434
01:28:00,651 --> 01:28:01,693
OK.

435
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:03,570
You can go.

436
01:28:09,618 --> 01:28:11,078
What the fuck are you doing?

437
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:15,666
Fuck off.

438
01:28:17,855 --> 01:28:19,315
Get out of my way you fucking dyke.

439
01:28:19,419 --> 01:28:21,401
Ow, what the fuck? You prick.

440
01:28:22,235 --> 01:28:23,277
Yeah?

441
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,638
What the hell has just happened?

442
01:28:30,576 --> 01:28:31,723
Is that for me?

443
01:28:38,918 --> 01:28:41,108
Look at the state of your face.

444
01:28:52,578 --> 01:28:54,663
Ugh, I'd almost forgotten
what this feels like.

445
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:59,147
What the fuck do you actually
do up there in the North?

446
01:28:59,251 --> 01:29:01,232
I'm ready for round two babe!

447
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:05,976
Who was that guy Mikey? Huh?

448
01:29:07,123 --> 01:29:11,294
No one. Look, I can't
please everyone, can I?

449
01:29:12,493 --> 01:29:14,162
You're selling yourself again.

450
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:14,996
Chris...

451
01:29:15,204 --> 01:29:17,603
Oh Mikey.

452
01:29:20,366 --> 01:29:23,337
Look, why don't you move down here?
Stay with me?

453
01:29:23,755 --> 01:29:26,153
You can be like my bodyguard or something?

454
01:29:26,674 --> 01:29:28,468
I'm not that kind of person anymore, Mikey.

455
01:29:28,551 --> 01:29:31,158
I can't go back to trawling the bars alone.

456
01:29:31,575 --> 01:29:35,120
That one night stand,
Mikey, made me feel like shit.

457
01:29:35,537 --> 01:29:37,205
And I'm worried about you.

458
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:42,210
Don't be daft. And you wouldn't
be alone I'd come with you.

459
01:29:43,462 --> 01:29:47,007
Chris, you're like fresh
meat down here babe.

460
01:29:47,424 --> 01:29:50,239
Plenty of dykes would love to
get their tubby little hands on you.

461
01:29:50,552 --> 01:29:52,533
Don't…I hate that word.

462
01:29:52,638 --> 01:29:53,159
What, dyke?

463
01:29:53,263 --> 01:29:54,306
No, tubby.

464
01:29:55,661 --> 01:29:57,872
Do you remember that guy
we brought back to the flat?

465
01:29:58,268 --> 01:30:00,562
Yeah you do, the one in a orange tutu?

466
01:30:02,543 --> 01:30:05,463
To this day, I still can't
believe I kissed him,

467
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:08,591
with your lady juice all over his face!

468
01:30:09,008 --> 01:30:10,781
God, who were we then?!

469
01:30:12,866 --> 01:30:14,222
We had a laugh.

470
01:30:14,847 --> 01:30:18,080
Listen babe I've got to go. I've
got to see a friend about something.

471
01:30:18,497 --> 01:30:20,269
What? What about?

472
01:30:20,686 --> 01:30:22,772
Nothing... It's just a regular thing we do.

473
01:30:23,189 --> 01:30:25,379
Oh for fuck's sake, Mikey?

474
01:30:26,004 --> 01:30:29,341
Two hours max that's all. Enjoy the beach!

475
01:30:29,445 --> 01:30:30,488
See you later.

476
01:30:38,725 --> 01:30:41,228
Listen, all I”m asking
for is a couple of minutes.

477
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:50,195
Look, this is obviously not a good time.
I'm going to call you back later.

478
01:30:50,404 --> 01:30:51,551
Ok I've got to go.

479
01:30:54,366 --> 01:30:57,807
[Off screen]: Monkey… Monkey.

480
01:31:00,779 --> 01:31:01,821
Hello boy!

481
01:31:02,708 --> 01:31:08,025
Monkey behave! I'm so sorry. He's pretty
harmless, he just loves the attention.

482
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:09,172
He's adorable.

483
01:31:09,381 --> 01:31:13,447
Yeah but he thinks everyone wants to play.
I'm sorry, are you ok?

484
01:31:15,116 --> 01:31:18,557
Yeah I'm fine. How old is he?

485
01:31:19,391 --> 01:31:24,813
Well, in human years he's 7. So
yeah, in dog years, he's getting on really.

486
01:31:25,543 --> 01:31:26,898
I know the feeling.

487
01:31:27,733 --> 01:31:29,088
You're just visiting eh?

488
01:31:29,297 --> 01:31:30,756
Is it that obvious?!

489
01:31:31,173 --> 01:31:34,302
Ha, no I just do this walk everyday
and I've never seen you before.

490
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:39,619
Yeah, just visiting a friend,
who happens to be busy at the moment.

491
01:31:43,582 --> 01:31:47,909
Ah… Well, do you… Do you fancy
grabbing a coffee or something?

492
01:31:49,629 --> 01:31:51,715
You know, just while you're friends busy?

493
01:32:22,892 --> 01:32:25,186
Well you know what you're going don't you?

494
01:32:27,167 --> 01:32:28,418
Thanks.

495
01:32:33,267 --> 01:32:35,404
So when did you split from your ex?

496
01:32:42,078 --> 01:32:48,334
A few months ago.
It's not her that concerns me though.

497
01:32:50,002 --> 01:32:55,737
We have a little girl, Mia.

498
01:32:59,178 --> 01:33:02,619
Deb wanted to be a mother so badly.

499
01:33:02,828 --> 01:33:05,121
And I'd have done anything to please her.

500
01:33:06,373 --> 01:33:10,335
The day that she gave birth...

501
01:33:13,985 --> 01:33:18,572
I dunno, something massively changed in me?

502
01:33:21,336 --> 01:33:24,255
I suppose that's what being a parent does.

503
01:33:27,279 --> 01:33:35,621
Anyway, Deb met someone else…
They live together now.

504
01:33:37,185 --> 01:33:44,849
She just rammed it down my throat saying
that Mia was young enough to forget me.

505
01:33:51,313 --> 01:33:53,086
God, what a bitch.

506
01:33:55,849 --> 01:33:58,195
I think it was just a
mother's instinct to be honest.

507
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:02,366
No, that's no excuse to be fucking cruel.

508
01:34:03,096 --> 01:34:04,869
You're her parent too.

509
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:12,585
Technically, we're not
related…. I mean not genetically.

510
01:34:13,732 --> 01:34:17,694
Look, I know we've only just met

511
01:34:18,737 --> 01:34:21,865
and it's probably not even my place to say,

512
01:34:23,481 --> 01:34:29,372
but you can't let your ex push
you out of your daughter's life.

513
01:34:29,581 --> 01:34:30,415
I mean, Jesus,

514
01:34:30,519 --> 01:34:35,733
if you were a bloke who used
a sperm donor to have a child,

515
01:34:36,358 --> 01:34:39,382
we wouldn't even be
having this conversation.

516
01:34:41,363 --> 01:34:47,307
I just miss… I miss my little girl…

517
01:34:53,146 --> 01:34:56,587
And I'm sure she's missing you,
no matter what anyone else says.

518
01:34:58,464 --> 01:35:00,654
Get your daughter back, Chris.

519
01:35:03,156 --> 01:35:05,971
You leave your number
before you go back, yeah?

520
01:35:19,422 --> 01:35:21,612
I used to love metal
detecting when I was a kid.

521
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:23,697
Did you find much?

522
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:27,764
No... Just the odd coin.

523
01:35:30,892 --> 01:35:33,812
See, there's a space
for sale under the arches.

524
01:35:35,063 --> 01:35:39,338
If we had the money we could
open that club, do you remember?

525
01:35:40,589 --> 01:35:44,656
The music would be blinding
but we'd drink away the profits, right!

526
01:35:49,348 --> 01:35:54,979
I'm sick of being skint.
Renting my arse out for a fucking drink.

527
01:35:56,334 --> 01:35:59,150
I'm sick of never getting it right, Mikey.

528
01:36:00,088 --> 01:36:03,008
You know, life and its bullshit.

529
01:36:04,155 --> 01:36:07,283
But we battle through babe, we always have.

530
01:36:08,377 --> 01:36:10,671
But it seems easier when you're around.

531
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:20,494
So are you and Jess going to hook up again?

532
01:36:20,942 --> 01:36:26,990
God, you know everyone.
She's a sweet girl.

533
01:36:29,909 --> 01:36:31,578
Listen, why don't you come back with me?

534
01:36:32,203 --> 01:36:34,602
Even if it's just just
for a couple of days?

535
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:38,772
You are fucking joking?
What? To lezzerland?

536
01:36:39,607 --> 01:36:41,275
There ARE men in Hebden you know!

537
01:36:41,901 --> 01:36:45,133
And I'm sure you're pretty good
at sniffing out you're own type.

538
01:36:46,801 --> 01:36:49,200
Plus it would be nice to have some company.

539
01:36:52,953 --> 01:36:56,290
Fuck it. Yeah, why not?

540
01:36:58,792 --> 01:37:01,503
There are no clubs mind, just local pubs…

541
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:05,674
Can we stop at a Little Chef on the way up?

542
01:37:05,987 --> 01:37:07,551
I could fucking murder a fry up.

543
01:37:08,073 --> 01:37:09,949
Oh yeah a bit of sausage.

544
01:37:12,713 --> 01:37:14,433
You know, they're all posh now.

545
01:37:14,954 --> 01:37:16,206
Shit, yeah …

546
01:37:16,988 --> 01:37:21,315
Well, I'm sure we'll find a greasy spoon
somewhere, it's the fucking North after all.

547
01:37:39,875 --> 01:37:41,231
Hey, she's still working!

548
01:37:41,752 --> 01:37:43,316
You better fucking believe it.

549
01:38:49,684 --> 01:38:50,831
You wanna get out of here?

550
01:38:52,166 --> 01:38:53,751
I'm not going home with you.

551
01:38:54,043 --> 01:38:55,086
Why?

552
01:38:55,419 --> 01:39:02,093
Well for one, I have to work in the
morning. And um, I know how you operate.

553
01:39:04,387 --> 01:39:06,264
How do I operate?

554
01:39:06,973 --> 01:39:08,140
I've seen you around.

555
01:39:10,309 --> 01:39:12,395
Maybe I just like you.

556
01:39:12,603 --> 01:39:17,733
Oh yeah?
Then why don't you ask me out on a date.

557
01:39:18,985 --> 01:39:22,113
Let's go out on a date.
Right now.

558
01:39:37,128 --> 01:39:38,170
Call me.

559
01:39:45,428 --> 01:39:46,470
What the fuck?

560
01:40:55,831 --> 01:40:57,917
Hey, where we going?

561
01:40:59,710 --> 01:41:01,796
C'mon player. You'll see.

562
01:41:51,303 --> 01:41:53,389
Uh-uh, I need you to drive.

563
01:42:00,354 --> 01:42:04,984
Besides, seems like you're
still tripping over home-girl.

564
01:42:07,361 --> 01:42:08,404
What?

565
01:42:08,612 --> 01:42:09,989
Your bathroom friend?

566
01:42:11,449 --> 01:42:14,034
Whatever. I'm not tripping now.

567
01:42:22,751 --> 01:42:24,628
Be sweet and buy me another shot?

568
01:42:35,723 --> 01:42:36,765
Stop here.

569
01:43:31,612 --> 01:43:33,197
You like whiskey huh?

570
01:43:35,074 --> 01:43:36,325
This bottle's special.

571
01:43:36,534 --> 01:43:37,576
Oh. Henny.

572
01:43:37,993 --> 01:43:40,496
No. My last bottle.

573
01:43:42,456 --> 01:43:43,832
You're quitting drinking?

574
01:43:44,667 --> 01:43:47,586
In 52 minutes.

575
01:43:48,003 --> 01:43:49,046
Quit now.

576
01:43:59,932 --> 01:44:01,350
We could back to my place.

577
01:44:03,936 --> 01:44:07,189
Uh-uh. I got somewhere to be.

578
01:44:08,649 --> 01:44:10,734
So what, I'm your chauffeur for the night?

579
01:44:11,026 --> 01:44:17,074
Aw, don't be like that. You'll get
what you want. I'm slutty when I'm lit.

580
01:44:36,051 --> 01:44:37,678
You really don't know what tonight is?

581
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:38,762
No.

582
01:44:39,513 --> 01:44:45,144
Lunar eclipse.
This one's special, it's in Virgo.

583
01:44:45,436 --> 01:44:47,938
Powerful energy for letting go.

584
01:44:48,981 --> 01:44:50,566
You're so California.

585
01:44:52,735 --> 01:44:56,405
Yeah. Well, last time I tried to get
sober I chose my birthday as the cut-off.

586
01:44:57,031 --> 01:45:02,536
Problem is I don't know what time
I was born. No one ever told me.

587
01:45:02,703 --> 01:45:04,121
I went hard that day.

588
01:45:05,372 --> 01:45:13,172
Just kept pushing it forward like, maybe I
was born at 10, no maybe 11, no maybe 11:59.

589
01:45:15,049 --> 01:45:17,468
Got so drunk I forgot about the whole plan.

590
01:45:22,556 --> 01:45:26,935
I know I'm not supposed to say this but,
I like you when you drink.

591
01:45:27,853 --> 01:45:32,107
Yeah. Do you like that I wanna drink
more than I wanna fuck you?

592
01:46:15,526 --> 01:46:16,151
Wait –.

593
01:46:16,485 --> 01:46:17,194
C'mon player.

594
01:46:17,403 --> 01:46:18,445
Wait, is this for real?

595
01:46:18,570 --> 01:46:19,905
Is this for real or what?

596
01:46:20,030 --> 01:46:21,073
Or are you wasted.

597
01:46:24,702 --> 01:46:25,994
You're asking me if I'm wasted?

598
01:46:30,124 --> 01:46:32,518
C'mon don't tell me you've
never fucked a drunk girl before.

599
01:46:32,543 --> 01:46:34,628
I've seen the girls you pick up at the Lex.

600
01:46:35,963 --> 01:46:39,007
You've seen me before?
How come I haven't seen you?

601
01:46:39,216 --> 01:46:40,676
I've been avoiding you player.

602
01:46:40,759 --> 01:46:49,101
Stop calling me that.
Besides, with you it's-

603
01:46:50,352 --> 01:46:53,480
It's what? Different?

604
01:47:10,581 --> 01:47:14,126
Don't miss it.
It's any minute now.

605
01:48:52,891 --> 01:48:53,934
It was here right?

606
01:49:45,110 --> 01:49:46,570
You can't come up.

607
01:49:50,324 --> 01:49:51,575
When will I see you…

608
01:49:55,120 --> 01:49:56,496
Will I see you again?

609
01:50:00,042 --> 01:50:01,293
What about your car?

610
01:50:02,961 --> 01:50:05,047
It was a piece of shit anyway.

611
01:50:11,261 --> 01:50:14,473
I'm sorry I usually don't\- You're okay.

612
01:50:14,681 --> 01:50:19,061
- It's just I meant it. What I said about you, I...
- I know
