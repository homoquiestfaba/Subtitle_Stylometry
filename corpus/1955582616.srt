00:00:56,535 --> 00:00:57,970
 Watch your step. 

6
00:01:33,113 --> 00:01:35,435
 On February 26, 1998, a reclusive woman named 

7
00:01:35,483 --> 00:01:37,857
 Shirley Ardell Manson, died of cancer in Lexington, Kentucky. 

8
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:41,530
 The contents of your home was sold at auction. 

9
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:45,171
 Three days later someone discovered his secret. 

10
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:54,502
 New York City, November 2, 1957. 

11
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:55,281
 Excuse me. 

12
00:01:55,544 --> 00:01:56,335
 I am so sorry. 

13
00:01:56,602 --> 00:01:58,184
 Do not worry. That things happen. 

14
00:01:58,185 --> 00:01:59,394
 No. No. It was really my carelessness. 

15
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:01,408
 Be careful not to cut yourself. 

16
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:04,015
 You broke it. 

17
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:09,987
 You do not need to go. 

18
00:02:15,186 --> 00:02:16,294
 MS. Dorsett? 

19
00:02:21,377 --> 00:02:24,046
 Too late. Too late... 

20
00:03:00,241 --> 00:03:02,128
 Philadelphia??? 

21
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:11,895
 - Number? - Operator. 

22
00:03:12,115 --> 00:03:14,301
 I would like to make a connection to the distance to the city of New York. 

23
00:03:14,586 --> 00:03:20,186
 - Kondaic 50134 - Please insert 50 cents. 

24
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:29,771
 Please enter 50 cents. 

25
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:39,753
 - Hello? Hello, are you there? - Yes I am here. 

26
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,720
 Thank you. 

27
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:50,373
 Hello? 

28
00:03:50,446 --> 00:03:52,283
 - Stan. - Sybil, what happened? 

29
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,017
 - I do not know, I'm sorry. - We should have dinner last night. 

30
00:03:54,388 --> 00:03:55,373
 I went to his apartment, 

31
00:03:55,474 --> 00:03:57,073
 - You do not ... - I'm in Philadelphia. 

32
00:03:57,157 --> 00:03:58,264
 What are you doing there? 

33
00:03:58,347 --> 00:04:01,731
 - I do not ... - Sybil? 

34
00:04:03,496 --> 00:04:04,347
 Sybil? 

35
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,784
 MS. Dorsett? It has a message for you. 

36
00:04:29,296 --> 00:04:32,759
 - November 7? - What did you say? 

37
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,989
 How long have I been here? 

38
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,471
 We will see. 

39
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:40,141
 You registered on the 2nd. 

40
00:04:40,952 --> 00:04:42,452
 This is the sixth night. 

41
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:43,999
 Here, this is for you. 

42
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,464
 Now, when you go to your room, take a nice hot bath. 

43
00:04:47,635 --> 00:04:50,577
 I was very worried about you out there with this storm. 

44
00:04:51,213 --> 00:04:54,297
 I tried to warn you: do not go out there, but you would not listen. 

45
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:56,417
 broken glass? 

46
00:04:57,168 --> 00:04:58,675
 I can not pay for it. 

47
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:05,787
 crystal Broken 

48
00:06:16,261 --> 00:06:17,949
 Too late... 

49
00:06:29,283 --> 00:06:30,838
 Too late... 

50
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:36,716
 Sybil why you left school and gone for a week? 

51
00:06:36,881 --> 00:06:39,327
 I was a little nervous, that's all. 

52
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:43,053
 If you are nervous school recommends that you see a psychiatrist ... 

53
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:45,003
 ... before accepting you back. 

54
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,004
 I'm sorry. 

55
00:06:47,548 --> 00:06:51,050
 You do not have to apologize Sybil. It is a matter of disease. 

56
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:53,219
 Disease? 

57
00:06:53,503 --> 00:06:55,711
 It seems that you suffer from "Cat Syndrome" ... 

58
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,410
 ... a woman's disease. 

59
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,377
 The Greeks describe how wild feeling. 

60
00:07:01,048 --> 00:07:03,098
 Sometimes they call hysteria. 

61
00:07:04,474 --> 00:07:08,233
 Do you suffer from amnesia, severe headaches. 

62
00:07:08,983 --> 00:07:12,752
 In addition to his brilliance, his IQ is 170, it is very bright. 

63
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:14,634
 My mother was much brighter. 

64
00:07:15,238 --> 00:07:17,437
 You nãopensa much of yourself ... 

65
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:19,838
 ...first of all. 

66
00:07:22,064 --> 00:07:24,181
 Have you thought about suicide? 

67
00:07:26,891 --> 00:07:28,655
 Oh, I would never do that. 

68
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,809
 I do not want to go to hell. Because if I go to hell. 

69
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,366
 I will not see my mother in heaven my mother was a saint, you know? 

70
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,488
 Well, in short. 

71
00:07:40,396 --> 00:07:42,905
 Nothing seems to be wrong with you physically. 

72
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,757
 So I suggest you do psychoanalysis. 

73
00:07:44,874 --> 00:07:45,645
 Psychoanalysis? 

74
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,721
 I can not be more patient, but I have a colleague who would ... 

75
00:07:48,815 --> 00:07:50,574
 - devil's work. - What? 

76
00:07:51,832 --> 00:07:54,139
 My father does not approve of psychoanalysis. 

77
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:55,566
 Why that? 

78
00:07:55,969 --> 00:07:58,873
 Doctors use drugs and hypnosis and all kinds of things ... 

79
00:07:58,882 --> 00:08:01,128
 to make you say what they want you to say. 

80
00:08:01,252 --> 00:08:04,059
 I do not believe that Dr. Wilbur would. 

81
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:07,359
 - It will ask you questions ... - She? 

82
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:08,997
 She. 

83
00:08:10,284 --> 00:08:12,051
 Damn I have no time. 

84
00:08:12,447 --> 00:08:14,012
 I have customers all I can handle. 

85
00:08:14,113 --> 00:08:16,313
 I also have a commitment as a teacher. 

86
00:08:16,743 --> 00:08:18,381
 Understand that I'm already full schedule the way it is. 

87
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:20,182
 What are you talking? Would only be 45 minutes per week. 

88
00:08:20,244 --> 00:08:22,339
 You will like. She's from the Midwest, like you. 

89
00:08:23,972 --> 00:08:25,895
 Montana is not in the Midwest. 

90
00:08:25,998 --> 00:08:28,853
 Now let's Connie, you're the best lady, psychoanalyst, that time has created. 

91
00:08:28,886 --> 00:08:31,799
 Oh, that's because I'm a lady, or I'll take care of ladies? 

92
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,270
 It's going to be easy. I promise. 

93
00:08:33,355 --> 00:08:35,350
 It is only slightly hysterical. You're good with it. 

94
00:08:35,587 --> 00:08:37,420
 I really need to go. I appreciate that. 

95
00:08:37,522 --> 00:08:39,610
 If you have any problem just let me know. 

96
00:08:58,464 --> 00:08:59,315
 Sybil? 

97
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:03,572
 Oh, how are you? I'm Dr.. Wilbur. 

98
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,438
 Please come in. 

99
00:09:16,594 --> 00:09:18,008
 Here, sit down, sit down. 

100
00:09:19,373 --> 00:09:23,663
 I like to record the sessions, for my own reference. 

101
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:28,265
 At the end all the tapes will be returned to you, of course. 

102
00:09:28,338 --> 00:09:29,884
 You do not mind, right? 

103
00:09:30,586 --> 00:09:31,740
 No problem. 

104
00:09:40,304 --> 00:09:43,040
 Well, Dr. Atcheson came to me talk a little bit about you. 

105
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:46,198
 His family is from Wisconsin? 

106
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,564
 Little Conner. 

107
00:09:49,438 --> 00:09:50,447
 It appears to be small. 

108
00:09:51,645 --> 00:09:52,797
 And is. 

109
00:09:56,998 --> 00:09:58,921
 I came to New York to study Arts. 

110
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:00,903
 A big change. 

111
00:10:01,023 --> 00:10:02,173
 Yes. I bet you do. 

112
00:10:04,288 --> 00:10:06,051
 Do you miss Little Conner? 

113
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,044
 Who should not. 

114
00:10:09,072 --> 00:10:10,798
 It was perfectly wonderful. 

115
00:10:13,463 --> 00:10:15,415
 I had a wonderful childhood. 

116
00:10:15,678 --> 00:10:16,610
 And friends. 

117
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:19,476
 special friends as Tommy Ewold. 

118
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,627
 - Let's jump. - What? 

119
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,458
 It was my first great friend. 

120
00:10:31,657 --> 00:10:32,935
 - Let's go. - No. 

121
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:35,706
 Do you still have family there? 

122
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:37,841
 My dad. 

123
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:42,698
 My mother died very recently, and I was an only child. 

124
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,300
 I'm sorry to hear that. 

125
00:10:44,534 --> 00:10:46,525
 It must have been difficult for you? 

126
00:10:48,558 --> 00:10:50,407
 Oh gone. 

127
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:54,427
 I took care of her and in the end ... 

128
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:56,541
 ... we were never very close. 

129
00:10:56,678 --> 00:10:57,808
 Even when... 

130
00:10:58,773 --> 00:10:59,988
 ... she was dying. 

131
00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:01,884
 <I> Peggy Louisiana! </ I> 

132
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:03,826
 What was Mom? 

133
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:06,716
 I am so sorry. I was very rude to you. 

134
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,134
 What she meant by that? 

135
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:18,321
 Sybil? 

136
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:21,018
 What she meant when she said ... 

137
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:23,541
 ... so rude to you? 

138
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,597
 Well, I do not know. 

139
00:11:25,777 --> 00:11:27,768
 She was a wonderful woman. 

140
00:11:28,008 --> 00:11:30,345
 A saint. We were with sisters. 

141
00:11:30,526 --> 00:11:32,579
 Oh, I thought you said you were not very close. 

142
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,143
 Oh, but we were. 

143
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:36,647
 She took me to all the places where she was going. 

144
00:11:36,802 --> 00:11:38,204
 We were always together. 

145
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,170
 You see, my mother was over 40 when she had me ... 

146
00:11:41,172 --> 00:11:42,784
 ... right after the other baby died. 

147
00:11:42,845 --> 00:11:45,427
 I almost died too. I weighed only 2.5 kilograms. 

148
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:47,717
 And she was worried about me all the time. 

149
00:11:47,942 --> 00:11:50,226
 My father was also concerned. He was a busy man ... 

150
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:52,799
 ... he was a builder in the city. He built the church we were going. 

151
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,627
 You believe in God? 

152
00:11:58,126 --> 00:11:58,992
 You believe? 

153
00:11:59,392 --> 00:12:00,408
 Of course. 

154
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,907
 Are you Catholic? My mother would not approve if you are not Catholic. 

155
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:04,730
 Why not? 

156
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,650
 I did not intend to offend ... 

157
00:12:06,912 --> 00:12:09,052
 ... is that my mother does not approve most people ... 

158
00:12:09,106 --> 00:12:11,116
 ... and I was very unhappy ... 

159
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:13,107
 ... understand that I am far from being the perfect type ... 

160
00:12:13,173 --> 00:12:14,145
 - ... friends do not want ... - Sybil! 

161
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:17,443
 You come telling me what you think ... 

162
00:12:17,444 --> 00:12:18,698
 ... of all things ... 

163
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:21,554
 ... but I wonder how you feel about yourself. 

164
00:12:25,816 --> 00:12:26,635
 Sybil ... 

165
00:12:26,736 --> 00:12:29,718
 ...how do you feel? 

166
00:12:35,618 --> 00:12:36,976
 Not very well. 

167
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:43,167
 Since wee I've always been very sick, but not ... 

168
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:46,037
 What do you mean? 

169
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,367
 People said I was doing things I had not done. 

170
00:12:50,922 --> 00:12:51,865
 Like what? 

171
00:12:53,955 --> 00:12:57,325
 Well, sometimes I found people I had never seen before, 

172
00:12:57,483 --> 00:12:59,097
 they said they knew me. 

173
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:02,055
 And sometimes I find clothes ... 

174
00:13:02,057 --> 00:13:04,857
 I did not remember having bought hanging in my closet. 

175
00:13:05,422 --> 00:13:07,177
 Or paintings ... 

176
00:13:07,695 --> 00:13:09,373
 I began ... 

177
00:13:10,575 --> 00:13:13,228
 ... and when he came home, I found them completed, 

178
00:13:13,913 --> 00:13:16,827
 but in a completely different style ... 

179
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:22,006
 ...like this. 

180
00:13:30,396 --> 00:13:32,098
 Who is Peggy Lou Baldwin? 

181
00:13:32,483 --> 00:13:34,271
 I've never heard. 

182
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,950
 My mother used to call me Peggy Louisiana ... 

183
00:13:38,061 --> 00:13:39,669
 ... when I was a little girl. 

184
00:13:40,855 --> 00:13:44,126
 And Mrs. Baldwin was my favorite teacher in school, but ... 

185
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:46,075
 I did not draw it. 

186
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:47,886
 And where did you come from then? 

187
00:13:50,448 --> 00:13:55,025
 I found in my room in Philadelphia, when I ... 

188
00:14:02,896 --> 00:14:05,012
 What were you doing in Philadelphia? 

189
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:11,492
 I do not know. 

190
00:14:16,327 --> 00:14:17,107
 Excuse me. 

191
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,798
 - No, no, no. - Excuse me. 

192
00:14:19,303 --> 00:14:20,013
 Get one. 

193
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:21,258
 Thanks. 

194
00:14:22,725 --> 00:14:25,910
 Stan said I need to be more disciplined. 

195
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:27,395
 Who is Stan? 

196
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,358
 My boyfriend. 

197
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,083
 He is a mathematics graduate student. 

198
00:14:31,342 --> 00:14:34,665
 He is wonderful and understanding, I know that when we get married ... 

199
00:14:34,685 --> 00:14:36,559
 everything will be alright. 

200
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:40,967
 Will? 

201
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:08,064
 He does not want to see me. 

202
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,684
 I know it's my fault, but it still hurts a lot. 

203
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:12,690
 What are you talking about? 

204
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:14,811
 Stan ... 

205
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,881
 ... he left me in the gentlest way possible ... 

206
00:16:20,093 --> 00:16:22,235
 ... because he's a wonderful man. 

207
00:16:22,768 --> 00:16:23,508
 Sybil, 

208
00:16:25,947 --> 00:16:30,122
 you noticed, that changed completely subject to ... 

209
00:16:30,202 --> 00:16:33,167
 ... we were talking about a minute ago? 

210
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,224
 He left me this letter. 

211
00:16:47,937 --> 00:16:49,167
 Oh my God. 

212
00:16:49,248 --> 00:16:49,948
 What's it? 

213
00:16:51,555 --> 00:16:53,281
 - They did it again. - What? 

214
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:56,779
 Time ran. and does not do it for everyone, do? 

215
00:16:57,257 --> 00:16:59,632
 Sybil, what do you mean by the time go? 

216
00:16:59,747 --> 00:17:02,360
 - What happened? - I do not know. 

217
00:17:02,527 --> 00:17:04,038
 I do not know what happened. 

218
00:17:04,634 --> 00:17:07,924
 I'm here, then I'm not, then I'm new and all ... 

219
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:12,056
 ... things are so different, people are different. 

220
00:17:13,468 --> 00:17:17,163
 And you can not trust them, you can not ... 

221
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:18,744
 ... you really, really ... 

222
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:22,585
 - I want to go out, let me out! - Sybil! 

223
00:17:22,747 --> 00:17:23,597
 No! 

224
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:24,833
 Stop it. 

225
00:17:24,898 --> 00:17:26,518
 Be careful, be careful. 

226
00:17:28,694 --> 00:17:29,972
 Let me see your hands. 

227
00:17:31,973 --> 00:17:34,514
 What about the window? You do not care about her? 

228
00:17:34,952 --> 00:17:35,958
 Of course not. 

229
00:17:36,803 --> 00:17:39,803
 The windows can be repaired, much more easily than people. 

230
00:17:41,773 --> 00:17:42,935
 It's all right. 

231
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:46,851
 Are you alright. Come, sit down. 

232
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,449
 Sit down, dear. 

233
00:17:56,328 --> 00:17:58,331
 -'s blood. - Where? 

234
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:02,545
 Sybil not, do not. See, there's no blood. 

235
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:05,694
 In Grandma's bed, just before she died. 

236
00:18:06,234 --> 00:18:08,452
 And in the hay, the barn, where Tommy was killed. 

237
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:09,453
 Let's jump. 

238
00:18:09,582 --> 00:18:10,465
 What? 

239
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,551
 - Let's jump. -. That's not silly, Tommy. 

240
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:15,877
 Thus. 

241
00:18:24,294 --> 00:18:25,542
 Tommy !!! 

242
00:18:25,744 --> 00:18:27,236
 Tommy !!! 

243
00:18:30,133 --> 00:18:32,931
 He dropped the fork and he was dead. 

244
00:18:33,023 --> 00:18:35,830
 And I stayed there until the doctor arrived, because I did not want to leave him ... 

245
00:18:36,017 --> 00:18:37,951
 lying there like I did with my grandmother. 

246
00:18:38,219 --> 00:18:39,892
 She was bleeding when I went to call for help .... 

247
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,592
 the doctor came and took me from there ... 

248
00:18:41,757 --> 00:18:45,158
 would not let me see her when she died, oh dear God ... 

249
00:18:45,347 --> 00:18:49,115
 Grandma, please do not leave me, do not leave me. 

250
00:18:54,903 --> 00:18:57,333
 Sybil! Sybil! 

251
00:19:00,234 --> 00:19:01,568
 Sybil? 

252
00:19:02,135 --> 00:19:03,090
 Look at me. 

253
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:08,519
 Can you tell me more about your grandmother? 

254
00:19:15,184 --> 00:19:17,139
 You can say how you felt when you were living with her? 

255
00:19:17,174 --> 00:19:18,346
 Why do you care? 

256
00:19:18,347 --> 00:19:20,947
 - You do not care. - Sybil, I care. 

257
00:19:21,695 --> 00:19:23,968
 You're just trying to trick me. 

258
00:19:24,117 --> 00:19:25,326
 Many people deceive me, 

259
00:19:25,327 --> 00:19:28,027
 many people and they deceived. 

260
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,610
 I feel so bad when they deceive me. 

261
00:19:36,311 --> 00:19:37,122
 Who are you? 

262
00:19:37,157 --> 00:19:38,290
 Sybil. 

263
00:19:39,393 --> 00:19:43,492
 No, you're not. 

264
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:59,591
 - You can see the differences? - Oh, you can bet. 

265
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,987
 You can bet I can. 

266
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:05,898
 What's your name? 

267
00:20:06,563 --> 00:20:10,350
 Peggy. Peggy Lou Baldwin. 

268
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:14,396
 We are not similar but most people may think. 

269
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,464
 You did that drawing, Peggy? 

270
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:22,950
 Uhh. I like to draw in black and white because I do not ... 

271
00:20:23,058 --> 00:20:24,199
 I know how to paint as well as she. 

272
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:27,002
 Oh, I think it's very good. 

273
00:20:27,401 --> 00:20:28,862
 It is very, very good. 

274
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:30,714
 Tell me something. 

275
00:20:32,888 --> 00:20:35,411
 If you and Sybil are not similar ... 

276
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,226
 ... yet you relate? 

277
00:20:37,826 --> 00:20:39,901
 - Do you have the same mother? - No, no. 

278
00:20:39,997 --> 00:20:42,559
 No, she's not my mother. Do not say that. 

279
00:20:42,776 --> 00:20:44,654
 Okay, I'm sorry, I ... 

280
00:20:45,575 --> 00:20:48,427
 It's all right. I just wanted to know. 

281
00:20:48,893 --> 00:20:50,704
 Can I talk to Sybil? 

282
00:20:51,674 --> 00:20:53,303
 You can control it? 

283
00:21:14,686 --> 00:21:16,068
 What happened? 

284
00:21:18,575 --> 00:21:20,303
 Did I do that? 

285
00:21:21,098 --> 00:21:22,504
 I am so sorry. 

286
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,735
 - I'll pay for it. - No Sybil. 

287
00:21:25,072 --> 00:21:27,452
 Sybil, let it. Do not touch the glass. 

288
00:21:28,967 --> 00:21:29,946
 Forget. 

289
00:21:31,421 --> 00:21:33,747
 Sybil, have you broken glass before? 

290
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,248
 I do this all the time. 

291
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,997
 - But I do not remember how. - Do you have absences. 

292
00:21:39,846 --> 00:21:41,351
 Since when does that happen? 

293
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:44,802
 Ever since I can remember. 

294
00:21:47,215 --> 00:21:48,369
 Oh my God. 

295
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:53,979
 Do you know. Now everyone will know. 

296
00:21:54,258 --> 00:21:56,835
 No, no. Of course not. I will not tell anyone. 

297
00:21:59,605 --> 00:22:01,620
 When these absences happen? 

298
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:02,860
 Have you noticed some sort ... 

299
00:22:02,861 --> 00:22:04,392
 - ... pattern that is repeated? - No, no. 

300
00:22:04,422 --> 00:22:06,919
 - Something that triggered ... - What's wrong with me? 

301
00:22:10,738 --> 00:22:11,888
 I do not know. 

302
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:15,326
 But you and I will find out. 

303
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:18,180
 You will not use drugs or hypnotize me. 

304
00:22:18,215 --> 00:22:18,990
 No, no. 

305
00:22:19,091 --> 00:22:20,591
 You will not send me to the hospital? 

306
00:22:20,717 --> 00:22:22,801
 - Do not. - I do not want to go to a hospital. 

307
00:22:23,178 --> 00:22:25,515
 Of course it will not. You need not go to a hospital. 

308
00:22:27,507 --> 00:22:31,290
 Oh dear God ... I'm losing my mind. 

309
00:22:31,461 --> 00:22:32,732
 No, Sybil. 

310
00:22:34,643 --> 00:22:36,098
 You're not losing your head. 

311
00:22:38,388 --> 00:22:43,361
 Think that's a start. Only a start. 

312
00:22:45,241 --> 00:22:46,463
 OK? 

313
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,153
 I did some research, 

314
00:22:52,254 --> 00:22:55,654
 probably know that a handful of cases have been recorded. 

315
00:22:55,962 --> 00:22:56,998
 Connie, you know as well as I do ... 

316
00:22:56,999 --> 00:22:58,999
 that there is no such thing as multiple personalities ... 

317
00:22:59,052 --> 00:23:00,594
 the diagnostics menu does not even mention. 

318
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:02,796
 Oh I know, what the hell, if you could see it. 

319
00:23:02,797 --> 00:23:04,697
 I did, it is a brilliant hysterical. 

320
00:23:04,922 --> 00:23:07,201
 Suffering occasionally from some psychotic confusion ... 

321
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,401
 It turns out that is unconscious, 

322
00:23:08,603 --> 00:23:11,103
 - very talented ... - You think I have not considered it? 

323
00:23:12,408 --> 00:23:14,380
 Where's your objectivity, Connie? 

324
00:23:14,403 --> 00:23:17,321
 - What? - hysteria is a female problem. 

325
00:23:17,505 --> 00:23:18,838
 And that's why I sent for you. 

326
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,764
 Do not reduce this because we are women. 

327
00:23:20,865 --> 00:23:23,165
 I'm not diminishing anything. 

328
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:26,799
 I just said, check the menstrual flow. 

329
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,200
 to a pheromone balance, maybe crazy. 

330
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:31,201
 This is no side effect. 

331
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:34,402
 If someone does not help this girl, then she will end up committing suicide ... 

332
00:23:34,403 --> 00:23:37,703
 - or ending up in a mental hospital ... - I will not throw it in a mental institution. 

333
00:23:37,804 --> 00:23:39,004
 No, no, listen. 

334
00:23:39,205 --> 00:23:41,405
 Look. I know it sounds crazy, 

335
00:23:41,406 --> 00:23:44,306
 but the standards and no one else cares. 

336
00:23:44,707 --> 00:23:47,707
 I mean that something happened when this girl was young ... 

337
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:51,108
 that Paggy know, but Sybil refuses to face. 

338
00:23:51,109 --> 00:23:54,609
 But that turns the night in hiding. 

339
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,409
 But in a way, Peggy may be necessary. 

340
00:23:58,411 --> 00:24:02,311
 Look. It is to a new channel the water takes when it reaches the reservoir. 

341
00:24:02,512 --> 00:24:04,412
 I do not know how and why it happens, 

342
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:07,013
 but she expressed anger that Sybil care. 

343
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:08,914
 - Honey, please. - What? 

344
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,915
 Harold, come on. 

345
00:24:12,016 --> 00:24:14,716
 How do you know? I mean, we can ... 

346
00:24:15,217 --> 00:24:18,817
 we can discover a new frontier here. 

347
00:24:23,218 --> 00:24:25,618
 Hey! What do you think you're doing? 

348
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:28,218
 Hey Hey! This is my car! 

349
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,620
 No, it's not. This car is my father. 

350
00:24:29,621 --> 00:24:32,721
 - Not in hell he is. - Hey! Take your hands off me! 

351
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:35,622
 IT IS? You'll pay for this glass. 

352
00:24:35,623 --> 00:24:37,623
 I can hurt you. 

353
00:24:37,724 --> 00:24:38,823
 What are you doing? 

354
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:41,325
 - I'm taking it for damage. - No, you will not. 

355
00:24:41,326 --> 00:24:43,126
 The wasted time and fix it. 

356
00:24:43,127 --> 00:24:44,726
 That's all the money we have! 

357
00:24:46,628 --> 00:24:48,428
 Be careful, you stupid, 

358
00:24:49,129 --> 00:24:50,728
 - stupid ... - Ah. mad cow. 

359
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:54,529
 Stupid! Stupid!... 

360
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,830
 It can not be angry because her mother does not. 

361
00:24:57,931 --> 00:25:00,731
 It depends on me, and then I get myself in trouble. 

362
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,331
 Why her mother does not allow? 

363
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,733
 It is sin. 

364
00:25:04,134 --> 00:25:06,934
 Anger is purple. See? 

365
00:25:08,135 --> 00:25:10,235
 Who are you angry? 

366
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,336
 - Of people. - What people? 

367
00:25:14,337 --> 00:25:16,837
 Of people, the angry people. 

368
00:25:16,838 --> 00:25:19,338
 - With who? - As the Sybil's mother. 

369
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:21,939
 What have you done to make her angry? 

370
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,240
 Trees are not purple, stupid! 

371
00:25:27,241 --> 00:25:30,741
 Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! 

372
00:25:30,742 --> 00:25:32,942
 I can not answer everything. 

373
00:25:32,943 --> 00:25:36,443
 There are things I will not tell you and nobody can make me. 

374
00:25:37,544 --> 00:25:39,144
 I'll break the glass. 

375
00:25:39,745 --> 00:25:42,044
 - I'll break the glass and escape. - No! 

376
00:25:42,146 --> 00:25:45,446
 - Even if you do not want me to do. - You do not need to break the glass. 

377
00:25:45,447 --> 00:25:48,046
 You do not need to break the glass, you can walk out the door. 

378
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:49,748
 - I can not. - Yes you can. 

379
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:51,349
 It's not locked. 

380
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,350
 - Do not. - Go ahead, turn the knob, 

381
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:53,751
 - No! Do not open the door. 

382
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,852
 I will leave here the garage, I'll get the car of my father. 

383
00:25:56,853 --> 00:25:59,453
 - Why do you need to do this? - I do not like people or anything. 

384
00:25:59,454 --> 00:26:02,154
 - I do not like music. - Music. What music? 

385
00:26:02,255 --> 00:26:03,955
 Nobody likes me. 

386
00:26:04,156 --> 00:26:06,856
 - Nobody cares. - The hands hurt. 

387
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:09,357
 - it hurts a lot. - Your hands? 

388
00:26:09,358 --> 00:26:11,258
 Other hands, hands that come get you. 

389
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:13,359
 - Hands who, who? - They will not say. 

390
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,959
 I will not say, but I will not say, I will not say. 

391
00:26:17,961 --> 00:26:21,061
 No, you can tell me. Honey, can you tell me. 

392
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:23,861
 No, no. Does all get angry inside me, 

393
00:26:24,063 --> 00:26:27,063
 she wants to break things, say things. 

394
00:26:27,064 --> 00:26:28,364
 - Setting the glass! - No! 

395
00:26:28,365 --> 00:26:29,665
 - I need to do this. - No, let go. 

396
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:31,566
 - Where else would I live? - No. 

397
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,267
 It's all right. 

398
00:26:37,868 --> 00:26:40,768
 It's OK. You are OK. 

399
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,769
 No! No, no. 

400
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:54,570
 Dra. Wilbur? 

401
00:26:54,971 --> 00:26:56,671
 Sybil? 

402
00:27:00,172 --> 00:27:05,272
 I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. 

403
00:27:06,373 --> 00:27:08,573
 About what? 

404
00:27:08,574 --> 00:27:10,874
 About losing our sessions last week. 

405
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:12,875
 But you have not lost any session. 

406
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:17,876
 - Oh God. - Sybil. 

407
00:27:17,877 --> 00:27:20,077
 I think I can explain a few things ... 

408
00:27:20,178 --> 00:27:22,778
 ... but first I would like to ask you some questions, right? 

409
00:27:22,879 --> 00:27:25,279
 - What kind of questions? - Easy. 

410
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,580
 Like how you feel about the music? 

411
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:32,881
 I'm not very good, I had piano lessons as a child, 

412
00:27:32,882 --> 00:27:34,382
 But mother was very critical. 

413
00:27:34,383 --> 00:27:38,183
 - She was a good pianist. - And hands, and on his hands? 

414
00:27:38,184 --> 00:27:40,283
 Hands ever came to pick her up? 

415
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:41,585
 I think not. 

416
00:27:41,586 --> 00:27:44,286
 Anyone ever hurt you with their hands? 

417
00:27:44,387 --> 00:27:45,486
 Do not. 

418
00:27:46,688 --> 00:27:49,888
 You have a few glasses of memories? 

419
00:27:49,889 --> 00:27:51,089
 Do not. 

420
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,790
 Are you sure, you can not think of anything ... 

421
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:57,390
 You do not remember anything related to windows? 

422
00:27:57,692 --> 00:28:00,092
 Mother had some lovely crystals. 

423
00:28:00,093 --> 00:28:03,893
 Once my cousin Luana and I were washing dishes and her ... 

424
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:07,894
 Why did you do that? 

425
00:28:09,395 --> 00:28:11,295
 - Who made this? - Sybil. 

426
00:28:11,696 --> 00:28:13,196
 - Mother, I did not. - Clean it. 

427
00:28:13,197 --> 00:28:16,397
 - But, but ... - I said to clean. 

428
00:28:26,198 --> 00:28:27,698
 Because? 

429
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:34,599
 And blood. The blood signal leaves you disturbed? 

430
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,600
 Grandma died of cancer, the treatment bled enough. 

431
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:42,101
 I loved her, she was very good to me. 

432
00:28:42,602 --> 00:28:44,402
 What about Tommy Ewold? 

433
00:28:44,403 --> 00:28:47,503
 When he fell from the top of the barn, had a lot of blood? 

434
00:28:47,504 --> 00:28:49,603
 How do you know what happened to Tommy? 

435
00:28:49,705 --> 00:28:51,004
 Sybil ... 

436
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:56,506
 When you delete when you have these collapses ... 

437
00:28:56,607 --> 00:28:58,307
 ... of which we speak. 

438
00:28:58,308 --> 00:29:01,008
 Someone else takes over and takes his place. 

439
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:03,609
 Who? 

440
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,810
 Someone who is well inside, 

441
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:09,211
 - someone who is called ... - Peggy Lou, I know. 

442
00:29:11,112 --> 00:29:12,712
 So you know about her. 

443
00:29:12,713 --> 00:29:17,913
 Just know, I know what everyone does, especially Sybil. 

444
00:29:19,314 --> 00:29:22,514
 But you, you are not Sybil. 

445
00:29:22,515 --> 00:29:28,515
 I'm not, I'm Victoria, Victoria Antoniete Shalom. 

446
00:29:28,616 --> 00:29:32,716
 I was born in Paris, but I am Americanized, so, so ... 

447
00:29:32,717 --> 00:29:34,717
 ... please call me Vic. 

448
00:29:35,118 --> 00:29:37,217
 How are you, Vic? 

449
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:43,619
 Very well, but only when it is not. Sybil worries all the time. 

450
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,220
 Like now, for example. 

451
00:29:47,221 --> 00:29:49,821
 She does not like when I buy things. 

452
00:29:49,822 --> 00:29:52,822
 Oh ... so these are yours. 

453
00:29:52,823 --> 00:29:56,423
 I put on the credit card, but Sybil tries to get them back. 

454
00:29:56,424 --> 00:29:57,924
 It's very funny. 

455
00:29:58,525 --> 00:30:00,825
 How long have you been there, Vic? 

456
00:30:00,826 --> 00:30:05,526
 From the beginning. I was the first, and the other came. 

457
00:30:05,727 --> 00:30:07,027
 What other? 

458
00:30:07,028 --> 00:30:10,128
 Sead, Marie, Peggy and Vany ... 

459
00:30:10,829 --> 00:30:15,629
 Oh ... you do not know about them, right? 

460
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,430
 I met Peggy. 

461
00:30:19,131 --> 00:30:21,431
 - How many more are there? - 16. 

462
00:30:23,932 --> 00:30:26,432
 Are sixteen of us. 

463
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:43,233
 Good evening. 

464
00:30:45,334 --> 00:30:48,034
 - Vic? - It is too late? 

465
00:30:48,235 --> 00:30:51,034
 Well, actually I was ... 

466
00:30:51,236 --> 00:30:53,736
 It is not alright. Come on in. 

467
00:30:56,337 --> 00:30:57,937
 I was going out tonight ... 

468
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:02,738
 ... but I wanted you to see how my real appearance. 

469
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:04,439
 Wow. 

470
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,340
 Ulala. 

471
00:31:07,341 --> 00:31:08,940
 Her hair is very special. 

472
00:31:08,942 --> 00:31:12,942
 Oh, it's very special, it is not. But it gives me a lot of work. 

473
00:31:13,043 --> 00:31:17,043
 This cluster does not come easily, but I do not care. 

474
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:19,244
 I have a very refined taste. 

475
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:22,844
 But that's just my preciousness. 

476
00:31:22,846 --> 00:31:26,546
 Oh. Oh, I did not look higher, but ... 

477
00:31:26,547 --> 00:31:30,747
 Nevermind. It's just a candy curls to make it the way I like it. 

478
00:31:31,048 --> 00:31:32,448
 Do you approve? 

479
00:31:32,449 --> 00:31:34,149
 I, yes. 

480
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:38,750
 I do not allow that many people to see me like that way. 

481
00:31:38,851 --> 00:31:41,951
 Most of the time, I have to disappear. 

482
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:48,052
 And others, they appear differently than yours? 

483
00:31:48,053 --> 00:31:49,453
 But of course. 

484
00:31:50,654 --> 00:31:52,354
 Would you like to see? 

485
00:31:52,355 --> 00:31:56,055
 This is Peggy Lou and Peggy Ann. 

486
00:31:56,156 --> 00:31:58,255
 - Peggy Ann? - Yes. 

487
00:31:58,757 --> 00:32:00,657
 Peggy Lou is most of the time angry ... 

488
00:32:00,758 --> 00:32:03,858
 and Peggy Ann fearful and shy virtuously. 

489
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:06,759
 You probably will not know 12 of them. 

490
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,360
 - Sybil knows them? - No. 

491
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:12,061
 She does not know any of us. 

492
00:32:12,562 --> 00:32:16,361
 - Let me show you Mary. - Mary? 

493
00:32:16,363 --> 00:32:20,763
 Yes, very sweet girl. But a little neurotic. 

494
00:32:20,764 --> 00:32:24,764
 Well ... they are neurotic, all except me. 

495
00:32:24,765 --> 00:32:29,865
 At least, I think I'm not, but in this chaotic situation you never know. 

496
00:32:30,066 --> 00:32:32,966
 I'll let you know all eventually. 

497
00:32:32,967 --> 00:32:34,267
 You're in charge? 

498
00:32:34,768 --> 00:32:38,768
 I just a messenger. I communicate and control when they leave. 

499
00:32:38,969 --> 00:32:40,869
 Two, I agree. 

500
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,070
 When they leave? 

501
00:32:44,871 --> 00:32:48,371
 It depends, each specializes in something. 

502
00:32:48,572 --> 00:32:52,272
 For example, Peggy Lou, who met, she is good with anger ... 

503
00:32:52,773 --> 00:32:56,973
 and mathematics, she takes stock with checkbooks own. 

504
00:33:02,074 --> 00:33:03,574
 16? 

505
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:05,975
 Like no other recorded case. 

506
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,776
 And I have to treat all individually. 

507
00:33:09,577 --> 00:33:11,977
 Well. I hope each of you to pay separately. 

508
00:33:11,978 --> 00:33:12,978
 Oh, very funny. 

509
00:33:12,979 --> 00:33:16,179
 That's crazy Connie, I think you are reading many tales. 

510
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,980
 You think I'm playing it wrong, is not it? 

511
00:33:17,981 --> 00:33:21,581
 I think you are being sucked into a very controlling patient. 

512
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,982
 This disease does not exist. 

513
00:33:23,983 --> 00:33:26,283
 Nor is there a category for that diagnosis. 

514
00:33:26,384 --> 00:33:27,984
 So we proposed a. 

515
00:33:27,985 --> 00:33:29,885
 I write a story about it. 

516
00:33:29,886 --> 00:33:32,786
 And I make a presentation at the next convention of the APA 

517
00:33:32,787 --> 00:33:34,087
 We have created a category. 

518
00:33:34,188 --> 00:33:37,288
 That's not wise Connie, I think they will withdraw you from the stage to laughter. 

519
00:33:37,289 --> 00:33:39,089
 - You think so. - I'm sure. 

520
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:41,090
 She's hysterical high suggestion. 

521
00:33:41,091 --> 00:33:43,390
 When she, me or you have created these types of characters to ... 

522
00:33:43,392 --> 00:33:44,192
 justify analyzes ... 

523
00:33:44,193 --> 00:33:45,793
 - that they were possibly created. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. 

524
00:33:45,794 --> 00:33:47,094
 Do you think I created these people? 

525
00:33:47,295 --> 00:33:48,895
 I think you might have suggested, 

526
00:33:48,996 --> 00:33:50,196
 almost intentionally. 

527
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:52,796
 How often have you met her? 

528
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:57,798
 3? 4 She will not prove that short period of time. 

529
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:02,499
 Hal, Come. She spent all her life hiding the truth. 

530
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,300
 - She is good at acting. - Look. I see a lot of crazy people. 

531
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:08,201
 - What? Or hear me. - And I did not find it so unique. 

532
00:34:08,202 --> 00:34:10,002
 And now you tell me that this covering ... 

533
00:34:10,003 --> 00:34:11,303
 some iceberg of a psychiatric phenomenon ... 

534
00:34:11,404 --> 00:34:13,004
 - no one believes there. - Yes. I see at least I ... 

535
00:34:13,005 --> 00:34:14,505
 while you can not. 

536
00:34:14,505 --> 00:34:15,906
 You keep going down this path Connie 

537
00:34:15,907 --> 00:34:18,407
 It's a great opportunity, we may be making history. 

538
00:34:18,408 --> 00:34:22,808
 - You will destroy all their work. - Yeah, so I'll take that chance. 

539
00:34:26,809 --> 00:34:31,209
 - Bad day Doctor? - More or less. 

540
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,610
 A stab in the back, ... 

541
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:37,110
 ... I scratched some ribs, but not quite. 

542
00:34:38,712 --> 00:34:40,612
 Miki know. 

543
00:34:41,013 --> 00:34:42,813
 Nobody cares what I have to say, 

544
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:45,313
 they just want me to not listen. 

545
00:34:45,315 --> 00:34:46,815
 You have to be a bartender. 

546
00:34:46,815 --> 00:34:48,415
 - Hey Connie? - Yes. 

547
00:34:48,417 --> 00:34:50,717
 I have 16 cousins ​​looking for dating, 

548
00:34:50,818 --> 00:34:52,918
 you know someone who should I contact? 

549
00:35:00,819 --> 00:35:03,119
 - Men. - IT IS. 

550
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,520
 I used to be so proud to be the only woman in that department, but ... 

551
00:35:11,321 --> 00:35:14,121
 Lately I've been feeling a professional who has been tolerated ... 

552
00:35:14,122 --> 00:35:18,922
 ... to be the one that will sweep the mess that nobody wants to deal with. 

553
00:35:18,923 --> 00:35:21,923
 Yeah, I know a little of that. 

554
00:35:23,624 --> 00:35:26,524
 - Miki, what is it? - That? 

555
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,225
 It is these pins. 

556
00:35:29,226 --> 00:35:31,026
 Look at this. 

557
00:35:35,027 --> 00:35:38,227
 - It's a cute, right? - Yes. 

558
00:35:40,528 --> 00:35:42,328
 Give me one more. 

559
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:48,129
 Wow. Well well well. 

560
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,030
 I do not see what this has to do with me. 

561
00:35:51,031 --> 00:35:53,831
 What do you think you're doing during his blackouts, Sybil? 

562
00:35:53,832 --> 00:35:55,232
 I do not do anything. 

563
00:35:55,233 --> 00:35:57,633
 And if people have inside you, 

564
00:35:57,734 --> 00:36:02,134
 which they are not exactly people but consciousness levels. 

565
00:36:02,235 --> 00:36:05,335
 Personalities that are activated, they go out and take control. 

566
00:36:05,336 --> 00:36:07,336
 - This is impossible. - No, this is not. 

567
00:36:07,337 --> 00:36:10,337
 They emerge when you are inferior. 

568
00:36:10,338 --> 00:36:12,238
 They are functional in the outside world. 

569
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,239
 That's crazy! 

570
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,140
 You keep saying or doing something. 

571
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:16,641
 - Even if you are not aware ... - This is crazy. 

572
00:36:16,642 --> 00:36:18,341
 - what you are saying or doing - Are you saying I'm crazy? 

573
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,743
 No, I'm not saying you're crazy. 

574
00:36:20,744 --> 00:36:24,044
 And I'm afraid that there is not a great knowledge about this condition. 

575
00:36:24,045 --> 00:36:27,845
 That's a lie. You are a liar. 

576
00:36:29,046 --> 00:36:30,645
 Mother was right. 

577
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:33,947
 People like you try to control us, make us crazy. 

578
00:36:34,048 --> 00:36:37,048
 - Perhaps your mother tried to control you. - No, no! 

579
00:36:37,449 --> 00:36:40,149
 My mother was wonderful, she was the best mother ever. 

580
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,150
 She beat you, 

581
00:36:41,251 --> 00:36:44,051
 - and punished you when you did not ... - That's because it was my fault! 

582
00:36:44,052 --> 00:36:46,452
 No, it was because of her. 

583
00:36:47,253 --> 00:36:51,453
 Now, I want to know more about it ... 

584
00:36:51,454 --> 00:36:55,800
 I want to know everything that you remember about your mother. 

585
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,455
 She was very talented, 

586
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:08,455
 it could have been a concert pianist if her father permitted. 

587
00:37:08,457 --> 00:37:10,557
 Why did she not? 

588
00:37:10,558 --> 00:37:13,458
 He took her school, she had to work. 

589
00:37:13,459 --> 00:37:15,558
 Did she ever got to talk about it? 

590
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:19,060
 She was not angry if that's what you're inducing. 

591
00:37:20,261 --> 00:37:22,161
 Good... 

592
00:37:23,562 --> 00:37:25,562
 Maybe at first she was. 

593
00:37:25,763 --> 00:37:31,163
 She cut your favorite jacket, but God punished her. 

594
00:37:31,664 --> 00:37:35,064
 - As? - He made it very, very sick. 

595
00:37:35,465 --> 00:37:37,965
 She was so excited, 

596
00:37:38,066 --> 00:37:41,165
 family dishes had to be placed with cloths because ... 

597
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:43,167
 She could not bear to see them. 

598
00:37:43,168 --> 00:37:46,868
 This is very agitated. She was always so nervous? 

599
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:50,469
 No! It was much better when grown. 

600
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:56,569
 Except when ... 

601
00:37:57,371 --> 00:37:59,171
 When what, Sybil? 

602
00:38:00,172 --> 00:38:02,672
 When she tried to put the needle line. 

603
00:38:02,673 --> 00:38:06,872
 But I could not do that, Dad had to do it. He did. 

604
00:38:06,874 --> 00:38:10,874
 Everything and then he was a wonderful husband ... and a father. 

605
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:17,775
 He even took care of her after I was born. 

606
00:38:17,776 --> 00:38:21,176
 She was so sad. He did not allow her to take me. 

607
00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:23,677
 So I wept much, and ... 

608
00:38:23,678 --> 00:38:26,478
 That's why Grandma appeared there. 

609
00:38:27,279 --> 00:38:29,979
 Grandma made me sit on her lap. 

610
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:33,280
 When she was come, nothing hurt, nothing. 

611
00:38:33,481 --> 00:38:34,681
 What you mean? 

612
00:38:34,682 --> 00:38:36,982
 She never got angry with me. 

613
00:38:36,983 --> 00:38:40,983
 I readied the table, she never said what I was doing wrong. 

614
00:38:46,484 --> 00:38:51,084
 When she died, they were not allowed to see her. 

615
00:39:06,285 --> 00:39:09,285
 Grandmother! 

616
00:39:10,786 --> 00:39:13,886
 The next thing I realized, was in a classroom ... 

617
00:39:13,887 --> 00:39:17,087
 and it was two years later. I did not recognize the teacher. 

618
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:20,888
 We were studying arithmetic and I had never learned math. 

619
00:39:20,889 --> 00:39:23,789
 Yes, but someone else must obviously have learned. 

620
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,290
 It means your checkbook is accounted for, right. 

621
00:39:26,391 --> 00:39:29,091
 This is not proof that when you're not here, that ... 

622
00:39:29,092 --> 00:39:31,792
 someone else is taking care of you? 

623
00:39:32,193 --> 00:39:34,993
 Who? Who would do that for me? 

624
00:39:35,294 --> 00:39:36,993
 Her name is Peggy. 

625
00:39:36,995 --> 00:39:39,895
 Stop trying to make her believe me that obviously ... 

626
00:39:39,896 --> 00:39:41,996
 - do not want. - What? 

627
00:39:41,997 --> 00:39:45,797
 I assumed because she was angry over the death of the grandmother. 

628
00:39:46,498 --> 00:39:49,998
 His mother was not going to lift a finger, so I had to be angry with her. 

629
00:39:49,999 --> 00:39:53,598
 I was out, really, for a long time, it was great. 

630
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,900
 So why did you come back inside, Peggy? 

631
00:39:56,901 --> 00:39:58,701
 Nobody likes me. 

632
00:39:59,002 --> 00:40:02,402
 I was angry all the time, because I did not like them. 

633
00:40:02,903 --> 00:40:07,502
 Then Sybil returned and I left. That was when he met Tommy. 

634
00:40:07,504 --> 00:40:13,004
 Tommy was the only friend. She could tell him everything. 

635
00:40:13,005 --> 00:40:14,105
 Let's jump. 

636
00:40:14,106 --> 00:40:15,906
 When Tommy died. 

637
00:40:17,607 --> 00:40:21,407
 It was tragic, but I assumed. 

638
00:40:21,408 --> 00:40:24,508
 It was the first time I allowed myself to come out. 

639
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:27,809
 even if it has remained inside for a long period. 

640
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:29,210
 Why, Vic? 

641
00:40:29,611 --> 00:40:32,411
 Because people who loved, Sybil. 

642
00:40:32,412 --> 00:40:35,611
 Grandma and Tommy died. 

643
00:40:35,713 --> 00:40:39,013
 I was the only one who could handle myself. 

644
00:40:39,214 --> 00:40:41,413
 Hurry up do not say. 

645
00:40:42,715 --> 00:40:45,915
 I am glad that is not blue because her boyfriend died. 

646
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:47,916
 Father would not like to see her with him. 

647
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:49,116
 Because? 

648
00:40:49,118 --> 00:40:53,317
 Why is it wrong to mix with people who are not of our religion. 

649
00:40:53,419 --> 00:40:56,419
 Tommy sabia, is burning in hell right now. 

650
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,720
 This is so tragic. 

651
00:40:58,721 --> 00:41:02,821
 How many times have I told you not to talk about this nonsense of French. 

652
00:41:02,822 --> 00:41:05,722
 - Olá Rita ... - Hi. 

653
00:41:05,723 --> 00:41:07,623
 - Wonderful night. - Oh yeah. 

654
00:41:07,624 --> 00:41:08,924
 Going to the park? 

655
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:11,425
 It's time to go to the Kigui Park. 

656
00:41:11,426 --> 00:41:13,426
 - Happy Christmas to you. - For you too. 

657
00:41:13,527 --> 00:41:17,027
 Merry christmas, it's such a snob. 

658
00:41:17,828 --> 00:41:21,028
 I'll show you. Look at this. 

659
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,328
 No, please. 

660
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:46,730
 She dedicated the wards of other people? 

661
00:41:47,031 --> 00:41:51,531
 I found it so embarrassing. How are you today, Dr. Wilbur? 

662
00:41:51,532 --> 00:41:53,932
 I do not believe we met. I'm Mary. 

663
00:41:54,133 --> 00:41:57,732
 Mary Lucinda Dorsett, I received this name after my grandmother. 

664
00:41:57,734 --> 00:42:02,134
 Do you like poetry? Grandma liked. Poetry relieves pain. 

665
00:42:02,135 --> 00:42:04,435
 What pain, Mary? 

666
00:42:04,736 --> 00:42:08,336
 I can not tell you, the death of the grandmother is very recent. 

667
00:42:08,537 --> 00:42:12,837
 No darling. She's been dead for 20 years. 

668
00:42:12,938 --> 00:42:17,438
 No, it is now passing that when this carry with you. 

669
00:42:18,339 --> 00:42:20,538
 We try to be heroes. 

670
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:24,740
 Sybil try, I try, but it does not work. 

671
00:42:29,241 --> 00:42:34,341
 Perhaps Sybil's mother, studying a way to try, Mary. 

672
00:42:34,442 --> 00:42:38,842
 But now she died, you can talk about the pain. 

673
00:42:39,143 --> 00:42:42,443
 Can? Can you tell me about it, Mary? 

674
00:43:18,844 --> 00:43:20,244
 - No! - What? 

675
00:43:20,245 --> 00:43:21,845
 - No, no, no ... - Listen to me. 

676
00:43:21,846 --> 00:43:23,546
 What is going on? 

677
00:43:24,847 --> 00:43:27,947
 When you listen to me? 

678
00:43:28,848 --> 00:43:30,348
 Listen me! 

679
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:32,049
 What is going on? What do you see? 

680
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:36,150
 Do not hit me Mom. Do not hit me Mom. Sybil is dead. 

681
00:43:36,151 --> 00:43:37,750
 Who are you? What is your name? 

682
00:43:37,852 --> 00:43:41,752
 - Mom. Mom does things. - Are you Ruthy? 

683
00:43:41,753 --> 00:43:44,753
 - Little girls. - What little girls? 

684
00:43:45,654 --> 00:43:49,454
 - Mom puts blades inside. - She does what? 

685
00:43:49,455 --> 00:43:53,355
 - It puts blades inside. - Within the little girls? 

686
00:43:55,356 --> 00:43:57,256
 It does this to you, Ruthy? 

687
00:43:57,257 --> 00:44:00,857
 Mom plays games, it hurts-the mama, mama makes promises. 

688
00:44:00,858 --> 00:44:02,258
 Promise what? 

689
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:05,859
 Do not tell, do not tell, do not tell. 

690
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,260
 It also hurts you, Ruthy? 

691
00:44:08,861 --> 00:44:13,060
 No, no, please Mommy, please do not hurt me. 

692
00:44:13,062 --> 00:44:14,962
 Bad girl. 

693
00:44:14,963 --> 00:44:17,463
 Mom I'll be a good girl, I'll be a good girl, I will not tell ... 

694
00:44:17,464 --> 00:44:20,564
 I will not tell, I will not tell, I promise, I will not tell. 

695
00:44:20,565 --> 00:44:22,265
 Bad girl! 

696
00:44:22,266 --> 00:44:24,066
 - No! No! No! - She's guilty! 

697
00:44:24,367 --> 00:44:26,967
 Stop it! Sybil. 

698
00:44:26,968 --> 00:44:29,268
 No, no... 

699
00:44:29,269 --> 00:44:30,468
 Sybil. 

700
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,670
 No, no. 

701
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:35,071
 Ruthy pare! Now! Ruthy not! 

702
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,972
 Alright, stop! 

703
00:44:37,073 --> 00:44:38,772
 Let me go. 

704
00:44:43,674 --> 00:44:45,474
 - Stop it! - Get away from me. 

705
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:47,475
 Sybil, listen to me. 

706
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,476
 - Stop it. Stop it! - you will not play with me. 

707
00:44:50,477 --> 00:44:52,176
 Please stop. 

708
00:44:52,878 --> 00:44:54,178
 Sybil, Sybil. 

709
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:57,079
 No! Sybil. 

710
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:04,180
 Stand back. No. You do not walk away from me, stay away from me. 

711
00:45:04,381 --> 00:45:06,580
 - Listen to me, all is well. - No. 

712
00:45:06,882 --> 00:45:08,882
 No! 

713
00:45:14,283 --> 00:45:16,183
 I'm sorry. 

714
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:22,683
 I'm sorry. 

715
00:45:33,285 --> 00:45:35,484
 It's all right. 

716
00:45:37,086 --> 00:45:41,486
 Ruthy, the one who attacked you only have six years of age. 

717
00:45:41,487 --> 00:45:44,787
 Her relatives make love in front of her all the time. 

718
00:45:44,788 --> 00:45:45,988
 Oh yeah. 

719
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:50,989
 Once the mother miscarried, Ruthy put blame on sex. 

720
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:55,189
 Her father defeated by bad luck, can you believe that? 

721
00:45:55,891 --> 00:45:58,391
 Hey! Vanessa I really like your painting. 

722
00:45:58,392 --> 00:46:01,292
 Thank March, its is also lovely. 

723
00:46:01,293 --> 00:46:03,593
 Let me get this straight. This is your march? 

724
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,794
 This is my Doctor. 

725
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:06,295
 Oh ... right. So... 

726
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:09,995
 That's his march, and this is your Vanessa? 

727
00:46:09,997 --> 00:46:11,596
 That's right. 

728
00:46:13,898 --> 00:46:16,398
 Any one of you can tell me ... 

729
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:18,699
 more about Ruthy? 

730
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,100
 Her mother treated her badly. 

731
00:46:21,101 --> 00:46:22,801
 The treated badly? 

732
00:46:22,802 --> 00:46:26,302
 It also hurt the little girl when the baby was born? 

733
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:28,303
 She kept the worst for you. 

734
00:46:28,304 --> 00:46:29,804
 What was she doing? 

735
00:46:29,805 --> 00:46:34,805
 She raped her ... with the handle of a hook. 

736
00:46:35,406 --> 00:46:38,806
 March, there is a concert tonight, I'd love to appear, 

737
00:46:38,807 --> 00:46:40,707
 would you like to go? 

738
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:43,608
 Get out of here, Fetish stinks, you know, I do not like him. 

739
00:46:44,509 --> 00:46:46,209
 Vanessa ... 

740
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:50,610
 Where were you when the Ruthy's mother did this to her? 

741
00:46:50,911 --> 00:46:53,511
 I was there, I saw it. 

742
00:46:54,012 --> 00:46:55,512
 We all saw it. 

743
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:59,312
 But you do not feel anything? 

744
00:46:59,314 --> 00:47:02,013
 Why should we? We are all different people Doctor, 

745
00:47:02,215 --> 00:47:05,015
 I'm March, and I'm Vanessa. 

746
00:47:05,916 --> 00:47:09,716
 Now Mary, and now Peggy. 

747
00:47:09,817 --> 00:47:12,117
 Not a sweetie. 

748
00:47:12,818 --> 00:47:14,318
 Vic. 

749
00:47:14,919 --> 00:47:17,219
 We are not the same people. 

750
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,919
 And none of us will disappear. 

751
00:47:32,921 --> 00:47:35,020
 I had never seen anything like it. 

752
00:47:35,022 --> 00:47:38,522
 This is not associated with some advanced type of amnesia. 

753
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:40,323
 It is more advanced than that. 

754
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:46,324
 Each character has its own standard memories, series of conflicts. 

755
00:47:47,525 --> 00:47:51,225
 And relationships with anyone, and yet ... 

756
00:47:51,526 --> 00:47:56,826
 None of them has the dimensions of separate individuals. 

757
00:47:56,827 --> 00:47:59,427
 It's almost like I can say that she is acting. 

758
00:47:59,828 --> 00:48:02,428
 And if I'm wrong? And if she's lying to me? 

759
00:48:03,129 --> 00:48:05,029
 She's good at it. 

760
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:06,830
 God knows how good at it. 

761
00:48:06,831 --> 00:48:09,331
 She spent a lifetime doing it. 

762
00:48:09,532 --> 00:48:14,832
 I never felt so indecisive, with my own training. 

763
00:48:17,833 --> 00:48:21,633
 I know that we should not get involved, but still ... 

764
00:48:21,634 --> 00:48:26,034
 She needs ... a mother or a friend. 

765
00:48:26,335 --> 00:48:29,135
 And I can not do it for her, so ... 

766
00:48:29,136 --> 00:48:30,636
 What should I do? 

767
00:48:30,737 --> 00:48:33,437
 And if it stops in a sanatorium because ... 

768
00:48:34,638 --> 00:48:36,938
 I do not know what the hell I'm doing. 

769
00:48:40,939 --> 00:48:45,339
 - Mom, please. - You'd better hang on. 

770
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:48,940
 Mommy please, please Mom. 

771
00:48:48,941 --> 00:48:52,040
 Stop it! Stop it! That hurts! That hurts! That hurts! 

772
00:48:52,042 --> 00:48:54,442
 I can not take it anymore, I can not, I can not! 

773
00:48:54,443 --> 00:48:57,743
 I can not take it anymore, I can not. Please. 

774
00:49:06,144 --> 00:49:08,944
 Oh, thank God it's you. 

775
00:49:09,345 --> 00:49:11,944
 Sybil Oh, what happened? 

776
00:49:11,946 --> 00:49:13,145
 I do not know. 

777
00:49:13,147 --> 00:49:15,846
 I woke up in an ambulance when they tried to give me an injection, 

778
00:49:15,948 --> 00:49:20,248
 I gave them your name. They would put me in a sanatorium for observation. 

779
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:23,348
 - You will not let them go? - No, no, no. Of course not. 

780
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:26,150
 Let's go. I'll get you out. 

781
00:49:28,951 --> 00:49:32,251
 That's it, no big deal, but ... 

782
00:49:32,252 --> 00:49:34,152
 please do not notice the mess. 

783
00:49:34,453 --> 00:49:39,553
 - Would you like coffee or tea? - Yes Coffee, please, black.. 

784
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:54,054
 Well, that's very, very kind Sybil. 

785
00:49:54,255 --> 00:49:55,455
 Thanks. 

786
00:49:58,656 --> 00:50:00,856
 Oh, I thought you did not play. 

787
00:50:00,857 --> 00:50:02,857
 I do not play. 

788
00:50:08,158 --> 00:50:10,357
 You think you might have something ... 

789
00:50:10,359 --> 00:50:13,058
 in music that night that may have disturbed you? 

790
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,960
 I do not remember. 

791
00:50:15,261 --> 00:50:17,861
 Maybe your father can tell us something. 

792
00:50:17,862 --> 00:50:23,062
 Well, he would never come to New York, he calls Sharon the city of sin. 

793
00:50:23,063 --> 00:50:24,363
 Saron. 

794
00:50:24,564 --> 00:50:27,263
 He never set foot in that place. 

795
00:50:27,265 --> 00:50:31,165
 He did not want me to live here, he wants me to come home. 

796
00:50:31,866 --> 00:50:34,966
 Or maybe we can go see him. 

797
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,567
 - In Little Conner? - Yes. 

798
00:50:38,868 --> 00:50:40,567
 Truth! You'd do that for me? 

799
00:50:40,569 --> 00:50:42,469
 If you think he can get me. 

800
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:44,770
 Oh, he'll love to meet you. 

801
00:50:44,771 --> 00:50:46,971
 I told him all about you. 

802
00:50:46,972 --> 00:50:49,972
 It is cozy, charming, a wonderful man. 

803
00:50:53,373 --> 00:50:56,873
 Hang on! Hang on! 

804
00:50:57,474 --> 00:50:59,074
 Hang on! 

805
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:04,875
 What? 

806
00:51:07,776 --> 00:51:09,776
 Mother, no! 

807
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,677
 - Dad. - Hello, my darling. 

808
00:52:04,678 --> 00:52:07,877
 - Nice to see you. - Nice to see you too, honey. 

809
00:52:10,179 --> 00:52:11,779
 This is Dr. Wilbur. 

810
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,480
 Mr. Dorsett, I was eager to meet him. 

811
00:52:14,481 --> 00:52:16,881
 - Mrs. Wilbur.. - Dr. Wilbur.. 

812
00:52:18,282 --> 00:52:20,982
 Well, let's go. 

813
00:52:25,683 --> 00:52:27,383
 You go to Dr. Wilbur church? 

814
00:52:27,384 --> 00:52:30,784
 Oh ... Oh ... no, not often. 

815
00:52:30,985 --> 00:52:34,385
 Done. The story of our life here. 

816
00:52:34,586 --> 00:52:40,785
 My father was very active in preparing for the end of the world. 

817
00:52:41,287 --> 00:52:45,587
 The Lord will destroy the earth and be blessed. 

818
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:51,088
 Feeling, for it is a sin. I think you disagree. 

819
00:52:51,089 --> 00:52:54,689
 Feeling is inescapable as breathing Mr. Dorsett. 

820
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:57,890
 We all know what happens when you hold your breath. 

821
00:53:00,191 --> 00:53:03,191
 Sybil wrote that you had questions about Hattie. 

822
00:53:03,292 --> 00:53:04,991
 It's a wonderful woman. 

823
00:53:04,993 --> 00:53:07,293
 Sybil said she was nervous. 

824
00:53:08,694 --> 00:53:10,994
 We are all sometimes. 

825
00:53:10,995 --> 00:53:14,694
 But we had financial difficulties. It was difficult for her. 

826
00:53:14,696 --> 00:53:16,895
 Everyone has their own customs. 

827
00:53:16,897 --> 00:53:18,897
 What kind of morals? 

828
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:25,498
 Hattie was a proud woman. She liked being on top. 

829
00:53:25,499 --> 00:53:28,799
 And when the depression came, we lost our money. 

830
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,200
 - He hit it too hard. - In what sense? 

831
00:53:38,401 --> 00:53:41,600
 He was bedridden and stopped talking. 

832
00:53:41,602 --> 00:53:44,702
 I had to dress her, feed her. 

833
00:53:44,803 --> 00:53:48,903
 I brought a man from the clinic and he said ... 

834
00:53:49,404 --> 00:53:51,704
 What is the word? Esquizométrica. 

835
00:53:51,705 --> 00:53:53,404
 Schizophrenic. 

836
00:53:53,406 --> 00:53:55,906
 Would you like some milk with your tea Dra. Wilbur? 

837
00:53:55,907 --> 00:53:59,107
 No darling. She was treated that? 

838
00:54:01,408 --> 00:54:03,908
 We were not able to pay for treatment. 

839
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:05,309
 So... 

840
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:07,110
 We pray, 

841
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:11,611
 and one day she began to speak again. 

842
00:54:12,011 --> 00:54:13,811
 She was healed. 

843
00:54:14,012 --> 00:54:17,212
 - It was nothing. - Anything? 

844
00:54:17,813 --> 00:54:20,813
 Santa is correct, it was perfectly fine. 

845
00:54:21,014 --> 00:54:23,214
 Mr. Dorsett ... 

846
00:54:23,915 --> 00:54:28,715
 Do you think we can talk alone, perhaps sometime this afternoon. 

847
00:54:28,816 --> 00:54:30,216
 I do not see the purpose of it all. 

848
00:54:30,217 --> 00:54:34,117
 Taking this time, Hattie was a perfectly healthy woman. 

849
00:54:34,118 --> 00:54:36,817
 Sybil was lucky to have her as a mother. 

850
00:54:37,719 --> 00:54:40,919
 Schizophrenia is not cured with prayers, Sybil. 

851
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,320
 At least none that I know of. 

852
00:54:42,421 --> 00:54:44,620
 She could not help, you should not blame her. 

853
00:54:44,622 --> 00:54:46,721
 Is there anything you remember here ... 

854
00:54:46,923 --> 00:54:49,323
 back here to do it remember? 

855
00:54:49,324 --> 00:54:53,024
 No, nothing bad, just nice things, like going to church ... 

856
00:54:53,025 --> 00:54:57,625
 ice cream, and visit Dr. tailler, it was beautiful violins. 

857
00:54:57,626 --> 00:55:00,426
 He promised to make me one so I ... 

858
00:55:03,827 --> 00:55:07,527
 - What? What is? - I will not say I will not say ... 

859
00:55:07,528 --> 00:55:10,028
 - Do you remember something, Peggy? - A broken bottle. 

860
00:55:10,029 --> 00:55:12,729
 Sybil was visiting Dr. tailler and Sybil's mother came along. 

861
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:14,630
 And Sybil struck the medicine bottle that was on the desk ... 

862
00:55:14,631 --> 00:55:17,231
 - but it was an accident. - You broke. 

863
00:55:17,932 --> 00:55:20,832
 - You are a bad girl. - Mom. 

864
00:55:21,133 --> 00:55:25,332
 - No, please. - What did she do? 

865
00:55:25,334 --> 00:55:28,033
 - No mother. - Ruthy, it's okay. 

866
00:55:28,035 --> 00:55:30,634
 Can you remember. I'm here with you, it's okay. 

867
00:55:30,636 --> 00:55:32,136
 Tell me what she did. 

868
00:55:32,137 --> 00:55:36,237
 - No, no, no! - Ruthy. 

869
00:55:39,438 --> 00:55:41,038
 Ruthy! 

870
00:55:57,539 --> 00:55:59,739
 She did not. 

871
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,640
 Do not, do not. 

872
00:56:01,741 --> 00:56:04,341
 I will not, I'll be nice. 

873
00:56:06,342 --> 00:56:09,042
 Ruthy, what she did to you? 

874
00:56:16,043 --> 00:56:19,543
 She... 

875
00:56:24,044 --> 00:56:26,844
 I have, I have to. 

876
00:56:29,245 --> 00:56:32,444
 I have, I have to do. 

877
00:56:32,446 --> 00:56:34,946
 I just want you to be a good little girl. 

878
00:56:35,247 --> 00:56:37,647
 Your mother wants you to go to heaven ... 

879
00:56:37,648 --> 00:56:43,248
 because the world is coming to an end and then it will be too late, too late. 

880
00:56:46,049 --> 00:56:48,949
 How often she did it? 

881
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,650
 I was bad. 

882
00:56:55,651 --> 00:57:00,350
 I behaved badly. 

883
00:57:00,452 --> 00:57:06,452
 And then she ... 

884
00:57:07,653 --> 00:57:09,953
 What? 

885
00:57:09,954 --> 00:57:14,354
 She died on the piano. 

886
00:57:14,355 --> 00:57:17,855
 - Mom, please. - You better hold. 

887
00:57:17,856 --> 00:57:18,856
 It hurts. 

888
00:57:19,157 --> 00:57:23,857
 I can no longer hold. I can not. 

889
00:57:23,858 --> 00:57:27,658
 I can not, I can not ... 

890
00:57:29,259 --> 00:57:30,459
 It is better to handle. 

891
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,660
 I can not, I can not handle ... 

892
00:57:37,461 --> 00:57:42,861
 - Mom. - You're bad, bad girl. 

893
00:57:46,762 --> 00:57:48,162
 Sybil? 

894
00:57:53,863 --> 00:57:56,163
 Sybil ?! 

895
00:57:59,264 --> 00:58:01,464
 What have you done with my daughter? 

896
00:58:01,465 --> 00:58:02,765
 She was perfectly fine ... 

897
00:58:02,966 --> 00:58:05,866
 before moving to New York and get to see you. 

898
00:58:06,267 --> 00:58:07,366
 This is not true. 

899
00:58:07,368 --> 00:58:10,668
 She was never quite right, Mr. Dorsett. 

900
00:58:11,969 --> 00:58:15,069
 Why did you allow your daughter to be raised by a schizophrenic? 

901
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:17,470
 - Do not blame Hattie ... - And she was catatonic. 

902
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,871
 by Sybil problems. She loved her daughter. 

903
00:58:19,872 --> 00:58:22,372
 And Sybil was truly happy to have her as a mother. 

904
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:24,673
 Even people like you talk to her and ... 

905
00:58:24,674 --> 00:58:26,274
 They do believe in all sorts of crazy things. 

906
00:58:26,275 --> 00:58:28,775
 - That never happened. - Excuse me, but this ... 

907
00:58:29,576 --> 00:58:31,876
 This simply is not true. 

908
00:58:31,877 --> 00:58:33,777
 What about injuries? 

909
00:58:34,478 --> 00:58:39,478
 You never noticed any marks on it? Oossos broken? 

910
00:58:39,579 --> 00:58:41,579
 For me just talk to you. 

911
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:44,380
 Hattie was abusing his daughter. 

912
00:58:44,381 --> 00:58:46,080
 She never raised a hand on Sybil. 

913
00:58:46,082 --> 00:58:48,582
 cold water and other things ... 

914
00:58:48,683 --> 00:58:50,783
 It raped a cable with a hook. 

915
00:58:50,784 --> 00:58:51,584
 How dare you... 

916
00:58:51,585 --> 00:58:53,785
 - come to my house and do ... - She beat her, tortured ... 

917
00:58:53,786 --> 00:58:56,586
 - these charges. - and even then you did not see anything. 

918
00:59:00,187 --> 00:59:01,287
 Anything. 

919
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:05,488
 Dra. Wilbur is the mother of the obligation to create the daughter. 

920
00:59:14,289 --> 00:59:16,889
 Oh God, what happened? 

921
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:26,390
 Who made this? 

922
00:59:37,591 --> 00:59:40,391
 Dra. Wilbur? 

923
00:59:40,592 --> 00:59:44,092
 Sybil? Are you alright? Do you need something? 

924
00:59:44,093 --> 00:59:47,792
 - I did. - What? What did you do? 

925
00:59:47,794 --> 00:59:50,794
 I straightened the apartment, before she went to Little Cornner. 

926
00:59:51,395 --> 00:59:54,395
 I built shelves covered, and bought blankets for her to sleep. 

927
00:59:54,396 --> 00:59:57,996
 I made Mike wash and dry, but I did all the hard work. 

928
00:59:57,997 --> 01:00:01,196
 Sybil, dear. I'm a bit of a hurry, so walk with me. 

929
01:00:01,298 --> 01:00:02,397
 Now... 

930
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:05,899
 - Who's Mike? - You have not met. 

931
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,000
 Well, it seems I have not met too. 

932
01:00:09,001 --> 01:00:10,301
 I'm Sid. 

933
01:00:12,202 --> 01:00:13,902
 - Sid? - Yes. 

934
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:18,303
 Sid, as Sybil Izabel Dorset? 

935
01:00:18,404 --> 01:00:20,904
 Hey. I had not thought of that, 

936
01:00:21,105 --> 01:00:23,305
 - Well ... - I am different from her. 

937
01:00:23,306 --> 01:00:25,706
 I'm a young man, like my father. 

938
01:00:26,207 --> 01:00:28,207
 It was built, I am also built. 

939
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:31,008
 Yes, but you are not exactly like his father, Sid. 

940
01:00:31,009 --> 01:00:33,809
 I'm sorry, I have arms, legs and all. 

941
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:36,510
 But not everything. 

942
01:00:38,711 --> 01:00:42,111
 Well, I never had it, but ... 

943
01:00:42,612 --> 01:00:44,912
 When I get older, it will grow. 

944
01:00:45,213 --> 01:00:47,813
 No! Now listen to me. 

945
01:00:48,914 --> 01:00:52,014
 A boy in a woman's body does not grow to be a man. 

946
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:54,115
 This is not the body of a woman. 

947
01:00:54,116 --> 01:00:56,716
 My mother was a woman and she was dirty. 

948
01:00:56,717 --> 01:00:58,417
 - I'm not a girl. - Yeah, but ... 

949
01:00:58,818 --> 01:01:00,714
 All the girls are not like your mother says. 

950
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:02,819
 But I told you, I'm like my father. 

951
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:06,420
 And Mike is like the grandpa, girls can have babies if we want. 

952
01:01:06,521 --> 01:01:08,621
 - Not exactly, I do not think ... - Yes, we can. 

953
01:01:08,622 --> 01:01:10,422
 What the hell you know. 

954
01:01:10,623 --> 01:01:14,123
 You're just trying to make me be like all the others, and I will not be. 

955
01:01:14,324 --> 01:01:16,924
 We are all different, can not see it? 

956
01:01:16,925 --> 01:01:19,425
 - We will never be the same. - Sybil ?! 

957
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:20,726
 Sid! 

958
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:41,227
 What are you doing, you have a lot of talent. 

959
01:01:41,528 --> 01:01:42,627
 Thanks. 

960
01:01:42,629 --> 01:01:45,629
 I've been admiring his work for long. 

961
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:47,930
 So many different styles. 

962
01:01:48,031 --> 01:01:50,631
 This is not exactly a compliment. 

963
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:53,732
 In my mind is. 

964
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:56,533
 I would go in an opening with me? 

965
01:01:56,734 --> 01:01:59,234
 - I'm friends with a gallery ... - No, thank you. 

966
01:02:00,035 --> 01:02:02,335
 Thank God she did not leave with him. 

967
01:02:02,736 --> 01:02:07,036
 - Meeting is a case of sin. - That's your opinion, Mary. 

968
01:02:08,537 --> 01:02:10,736
 But maybe if you were with the Sybil ... 

969
01:02:11,138 --> 01:02:13,038
 you may find that you have different ideas about it. 

970
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:16,039
 I do not want to go along, I just want to be me. 

971
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,740
 But you will not lose who you are. 

972
01:02:18,741 --> 01:02:21,741
 No, think of it as a democracy, each has ... 

973
01:02:21,742 --> 01:02:23,842
 Not much freedom brings sin. 

974
01:02:24,243 --> 01:02:26,743
 Freedom does not always sin. 

975
01:02:26,744 --> 01:02:28,444
 It brings the release of God. 

976
01:02:28,445 --> 01:02:31,545
 Do not confuse God with religion, Mary. 

977
01:02:31,546 --> 01:02:33,446
 You blame the church for who we are. 

978
01:02:33,447 --> 01:02:35,547
 No, I blame ignorance and repression. 

979
01:02:35,548 --> 01:02:37,348
 And you try to get away from my religion. 

980
01:02:37,349 --> 01:02:38,849
 I never said that. 

981
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:41,950
 But you think you want. 

982
01:02:41,951 --> 01:02:44,251
 Because I go to church can not be right at the same time. 

983
01:02:44,252 --> 01:02:46,652
 You do not realize. What I am is bad. 

984
01:02:46,853 --> 01:02:48,253
 This is my punishment. 

985
01:02:48,254 --> 01:02:51,054
 If I want to be better, God will punish me otherwise. 

986
01:02:51,055 --> 01:02:53,955
 And what did you do to deserve this punishment? 

987
01:02:53,956 --> 01:02:55,256
 Well, I must have done something, 

988
01:02:55,357 --> 01:02:57,357
 why else would God allow this to happen? 

989
01:02:57,358 --> 01:03:00,658
 I do not know Mary, but I know he wants you to improve. 

990
01:03:00,759 --> 01:03:03,359
 Improving means killing me, it's a sin. 

991
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,760
 - It does not mean suicide. - The world will end ... 

992
01:03:04,761 --> 01:03:06,861
 and I will burn in hell. I'll never see Grandma. 

993
01:03:06,862 --> 01:03:08,562
 No, Mary, Mary ... 

994
01:03:08,763 --> 01:03:11,063
 The end of the world that you are afraid. 

995
01:03:12,164 --> 01:03:15,564
 It's the end, it's the end of the world you know now. 

996
01:03:15,565 --> 01:03:19,265
 There is another world, a warm and free. 

997
01:03:19,266 --> 01:03:23,266
 Like all those little Russian dolls, put together ... 

998
01:03:23,267 --> 01:03:27,667
 A completely inside the other, you will not die. 

999
01:03:27,668 --> 01:03:29,168
 You will grow. 

1000
01:03:29,169 --> 01:03:31,769
 Precisely what we have to do? 

1001
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:39,270
 You have to enter the Sybil, Vanessa. 

1002
01:03:39,371 --> 01:03:40,871
 All you have to know. 

1003
01:03:40,872 --> 01:03:44,372
 Wait, wait, look at what it can do. She does not want to know us! 

1004
01:03:44,373 --> 01:03:47,373
 Look, I do not have time to explain, let me talk to Vic. 

1005
01:03:47,474 --> 01:03:50,374
 No, you will talk to me. We know that we are crazy Dra. Wilbur. 

1006
01:03:50,375 --> 01:03:53,475
 Put us together only make things worse. 

1007
01:04:01,898 --> 01:04:07,923
 Hal! Hal! 

1008
01:04:11,976 --> 01:04:13,476
 On here! 

1009
01:04:14,777 --> 01:04:17,477
 - Dr. Hi. - Why are you doing this? 

1010
01:04:17,678 --> 01:04:18,778
 Would you like to join me? 

1011
01:04:18,879 --> 01:04:20,979
 I would like to explain this letter? 

1012
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:24,480
 - We'll talk later. - No, we speak now! 

1013
01:04:24,481 --> 01:04:26,781
 I mean everyone here know exactly ... 

1014
01:04:26,882 --> 01:04:28,482
 what you will speak at the convention, right? 

1015
01:04:28,583 --> 01:04:30,983
 - I just present the problem. - Simply? 

1016
01:04:31,384 --> 01:04:33,084
 After my presentation, 

1017
01:04:33,085 --> 01:04:38,185
 You will perform and read 25 pages of paper calling me a fool. 

1018
01:04:38,186 --> 01:04:39,486
 Look, I treated this woman first. 

1019
01:04:39,487 --> 01:04:40,887
 - No, you have not tried. - And I get the odds. 

1020
01:04:40,888 --> 01:04:43,388
 You did not treat you interviewed her, Hal? 

1021
01:04:44,989 --> 01:04:47,789
 I am Connielia, and am no longer his student ... 

1022
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:50,290
 and if you disagree with me and tell me to my face, but ... 

1023
01:04:50,291 --> 01:04:51,791
 not humiliate me in front of all these people. 

1024
01:04:51,792 --> 01:04:53,692
 I'm not demeaning you, you're doing this to yourself. 

1025
01:04:53,693 --> 01:04:54,893
 Why is this so important to you? 

1026
01:04:54,894 --> 01:04:57,694
 Why do you think I'm forcing these personalities it? 

1027
01:04:57,695 --> 01:04:59,695
 You're getting hysterical, calm down. 

1028
01:05:00,096 --> 01:05:03,496
 There it is again, hysterical woman. 

1029
01:05:03,497 --> 01:05:04,997
 Stop this. 

1030
01:05:04,998 --> 01:05:07,098
 You think I'm overshadowing you, is not it? 

1031
01:05:07,299 --> 01:05:09,399
 - That's it, is not it? - Connie ... 

1032
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,600
 This is not about understanding the psychology, 

1033
01:05:11,601 --> 01:05:12,901
 - I think you're taking advantage - or anything else. 

1034
01:05:13,002 --> 01:05:15,502
 - For yourself. - It's about me not knowing my place. 

1035
01:05:15,503 --> 01:05:17,503
 You're being an ambitious woman, Connie. 

1036
01:05:17,504 --> 01:05:20,104
 IT IS? What's wrong with that? 

1037
01:05:20,305 --> 01:05:21,504
 Oh, wait! 

1038
01:05:21,506 --> 01:05:23,606
 It has a big problem with that. 

1039
01:05:25,307 --> 01:05:27,807
 And the right word for this is: Woman. 

1040
01:05:29,408 --> 01:05:31,607
 Oh, come on, Connie. 

1041
01:05:54,809 --> 01:05:56,109
 Hello? 

1042
01:05:58,110 --> 01:06:03,110
 Ramon. Oh, thank God there's someone here I can talk to. 

1043
01:06:04,311 --> 01:06:06,511
 How are you, Sybil? 

1044
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:11,512
 Do not call me that, call me Vanessa, it is a kind of nickname. 

1045
01:06:13,013 --> 01:06:15,313
 I'm bored, and I'm hungry. 

1046
01:06:15,514 --> 01:06:17,714
 Let's get something to eat, right? 

1047
01:06:18,615 --> 01:06:20,515
 You mean like a date? 

1048
01:06:20,716 --> 01:06:25,716
 Sure, and why not. Only three of us. Who knows maybe we'll get lucky. 

1049
01:06:50,117 --> 01:06:52,317
 I'm always there when they speak. 

1050
01:06:52,418 --> 01:06:53,918
 Vanessa Hey, want a hot dog? 

1051
01:06:53,919 --> 01:06:55,719
 Call me march. 

1052
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:58,919
 Marchat? Do not tell me it's another nickname. 

1053
01:06:58,921 --> 01:07:01,421
 Yeah, I guess you can call it that. 

1054
01:07:01,622 --> 01:07:02,821
 You're kidding me, right? 

1055
01:07:02,823 --> 01:07:04,022
 No! 

1056
01:07:04,924 --> 01:07:08,524
 - What is so funny? - Two please. 

1057
01:07:28,025 --> 01:07:30,725
 Oh my God. 

1058
01:07:31,226 --> 01:07:35,726
 It is a rare animal, as my feeling for you is rare. 

1059
01:07:35,727 --> 01:07:38,426
 Thanks Ramon, it's beautiful. 

1060
01:07:40,328 --> 01:07:45,828
 I love you Sybil, or Vanessa is any name you want to call. 

1061
01:07:45,829 --> 01:07:49,629
 I wanna take you to my house, to Argentina to meet my family. 

1062
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:58,430
 No! No, no... 

1063
01:07:58,631 --> 01:08:02,531
 - Sybil was just a kiss. - What is going on? 

1064
01:08:02,532 --> 01:08:05,932
 I do not remember anything in my mind that hurt you. 

1065
01:08:05,933 --> 01:08:06,733
 Did you really think it was me? 

1066
01:08:06,734 --> 01:08:09,534
 Pure and clear heart, they shall see God. 

1067
01:08:09,634 --> 01:08:10,434
 What is wrong? 

1068
01:08:10,435 --> 01:08:12,035
 Boys do not sleep with other guys. 

1069
01:08:12,036 --> 01:08:15,136
 - Of course not. - Stop it! What's happening to me? 

1070
01:08:15,137 --> 01:08:18,837
 Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid ... 

1071
01:08:18,837 --> 01:08:23,037
 - Please stop. - You stop! 

1072
01:08:24,639 --> 01:08:25,939
 <I> For the love of God. </ I> 

1073
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,740
 See what made me do! 

1074
01:08:28,941 --> 01:08:31,640
 <I> I've never seen anything like it before. </ I> 

1075
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:33,842
 It was horrible. 

1076
01:08:34,542 --> 01:08:37,742
 It was like I was talking to people who were not there. 

1077
01:08:37,844 --> 01:08:39,844
 But they were there. 

1078
01:08:40,545 --> 01:08:43,345
 All the people you told me. 

1079
01:08:43,345 --> 01:08:45,645
 - What I am? A freak? - No! 

1080
01:08:45,647 --> 01:08:47,147
 Sybil Oh, no. 

1081
01:08:47,848 --> 01:08:50,048
 No, you're not a freak. 

1082
01:08:50,049 --> 01:08:52,149
 You're making progress, believe it or not. 

1083
01:08:52,149 --> 01:08:54,549
 So how do I feel like I was worse. 

1084
01:08:54,651 --> 01:08:57,151
 As if these demons were taking control. 

1085
01:08:57,152 --> 01:08:59,652
 They are not demons, and they are not having you. 

1086
01:08:59,653 --> 01:09:01,453
 But they do, they do, they steal time ... 

1087
01:09:01,453 --> 01:09:03,353
 - No, listen to me. - They're taking my life. 

1088
01:09:03,354 --> 01:09:04,854
 Listen to me Sybil. 

1089
01:09:06,256 --> 01:09:08,456
 And if they were the only way ... 

1090
01:09:08,857 --> 01:09:12,157
 the little girl knows how to defend ... 

1091
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:15,458
 pretending to be someone else. 

1092
01:09:15,459 --> 01:09:17,959
 But she had to pretend so intensely ... 

1093
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:20,560
 the pretense became real. 

1094
01:09:20,961 --> 01:09:22,561
 You understand? 

1095
01:09:22,962 --> 01:09:25,262
 What choices you had, Sybil? 

1096
01:09:25,363 --> 01:09:29,063
 His mother abused you, your father was negligent, his grandmother died. 

1097
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:32,364
 He left me, white man ... left me. 

1098
01:09:32,865 --> 01:09:34,965
 Who are you talking about? 

1099
01:09:36,166 --> 01:09:37,666
 He said... 

1100
01:09:39,966 --> 01:09:42,067
 She broke my arm ... 

1101
01:09:42,167 --> 01:09:43,567
 And he says... 

1102
01:09:43,569 --> 01:09:46,269
 How's my big girl today? 

1103
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:47,270
 Good. 

1104
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:51,371
 And I saw that his shirt was unbuttoned the cuff. 

1105
01:09:51,372 --> 01:09:52,872
 And then I asked him ... 

1106
01:09:52,973 --> 01:09:56,073
 if I could close to him as I did with my father. 

1107
01:09:58,874 --> 01:10:01,174
 Of course, melzinho he said. 

1108
01:10:01,175 --> 01:10:03,875
 No one had ever called me melzinho before. 

1109
01:10:05,676 --> 01:10:08,376
 And he said I was ready to go home. 

1110
01:10:08,577 --> 01:10:12,277
 And I did. I knew he would take me with him. 

1111
01:10:12,278 --> 01:10:16,378
 He would take me home and be my new father, and take care of myself as a daughter. 

1112
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:25,379
 - But he turned and walked away. - Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! 

1113
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:28,580
 He left me, and this was the first time. 

1114
01:10:31,981 --> 01:10:34,481
 I keep waiting. 

1115
01:10:36,782 --> 01:10:41,382
 But I'm a Doctor, Sybil, and I'm not leaving. 

1116
01:10:41,883 --> 01:10:44,483
 I'll be, right? 

1117
01:10:45,184 --> 01:10:48,884
 I want you to meet someone. 

1118
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:57,685
 This is Peggy. 

1119
01:10:57,686 --> 01:11:00,986
 I hear the glass breaking ... 

1120
01:11:01,187 --> 01:11:04,187
 This reminds me of the cucumber dish. 

1121
01:11:04,688 --> 01:11:06,188
 I just had to run to the door ... 

1122
01:11:06,189 --> 01:11:08,389
 How did you get the voice of my mother. This is the voice of my mother. 

1123
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:09,390
 Disconnect! 

1124
01:11:09,391 --> 01:11:11,491
 This is the voice of Peggy Lou, she's talking about ... 

1125
01:11:11,592 --> 01:11:13,791
 No! Do not turn off this thing! 

1126
01:11:13,793 --> 01:11:15,692
 Do not you realize, Sybil? 

1127
01:11:16,394 --> 01:11:20,794
 Peggy Lou took the anger you felt, but can not express ... 

1128
01:11:20,795 --> 01:11:23,295
 for having been unjustly accused of having broken the cucumber dish. 

1129
01:11:23,296 --> 01:11:25,196
 I do not want her to take my anger, 

1130
01:11:25,197 --> 01:11:26,597
 I do not want anything to do with her. 

1131
01:11:26,598 --> 01:11:28,298
 Therefore Peggy breaking glass. 

1132
01:11:28,299 --> 01:11:30,499
 Well, I want it to stop! 

1133
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:32,600
 It's me much harm. 

1134
01:11:33,701 --> 01:11:35,801
 But it will stop ... 

1135
01:11:35,802 --> 01:11:38,701
 when you manage to get angry on their own. 

1136
01:11:39,203 --> 01:11:41,503
 - You want to hear more? - No! 

1137
01:11:43,804 --> 01:11:45,504
 This is Vic. 

1138
01:11:50,505 --> 01:11:53,105
 - French is terrible. - Yes. 

1139
01:11:53,106 --> 01:11:55,306
 I pray to God as Grandma did. 

1140
01:11:55,307 --> 01:11:56,807
 I will be a good Christian. 

1141
01:11:57,108 --> 01:12:01,108
 I try to forgive Mom when she hurts her. 

1142
01:12:01,109 --> 01:12:04,409
 The girls did the measurements, you have to give them credit. 

1143
01:12:04,410 --> 01:12:06,210
 But Mike and I did the rest. 

1144
01:12:06,311 --> 01:12:08,411
 They are useless without us. 

1145
01:12:39,312 --> 01:12:41,912
 She can play ... 

1146
01:12:42,513 --> 01:12:45,213
 - So beautiful. - Yes. 

1147
01:12:46,614 --> 01:12:49,714
 Vanessa is very talented. 

1148
01:12:50,015 --> 01:12:52,515
 Because? Why she can play and I can not play? 

1149
01:12:52,516 --> 01:12:56,415
 That's not fair. It's not fair to rob me, they took my life. 

1150
01:12:56,417 --> 01:12:59,217
 But once, since all are together again, 

1151
01:12:59,318 --> 01:13:01,418
 - you recover. - No, no I will not. 

1152
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:03,919
 I will never recover, they are many. 

1153
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:06,120
 - No ... Sybil. - No! 

1154
01:13:09,921 --> 01:13:12,621
 Do not. 

1155
01:13:19,422 --> 01:13:22,121
 - Stupid! Stupid! Stupid ... - What? 

1156
01:13:22,323 --> 01:13:24,723
 You can not trust them. 

1157
01:13:24,924 --> 01:13:27,224
 - No One Likes You. - You know who I am? 

1158
01:13:27,325 --> 01:13:29,825
 I'm Mary. Mary Lucinda Dorset, 

1159
01:13:29,826 --> 01:13:30,926
 Do you love poetry? 

1160
01:13:31,027 --> 01:13:34,127
 Best. I understand that you would get scared. 

1161
01:13:34,328 --> 01:13:36,428
 I quite like it. 

1162
01:13:41,129 --> 01:13:42,429
 You should listen to me, March. 

1163
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:45,330
 But you do not want to hear anyone but you. 

1164
01:13:47,530 --> 01:13:49,230
 What do you know? You're just a girl. 

1165
01:13:49,331 --> 01:13:52,331
 - Girls do not understand anything. - Please stop! Please! 

1166
01:13:53,632 --> 01:13:56,632
 Please do not do that anymore. Please please. 

1167
01:13:57,133 --> 01:13:59,032
 No, no! 

1168
01:15:17,234 --> 01:15:21,334
 - Who stopped you? - They all stopped. 

1169
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:24,835
 I do not want to go to hell Dr. Wilbur, 

1170
01:15:24,836 --> 01:15:27,936
 but it is better than living like this. 

1171
01:15:27,937 --> 01:15:30,237
 I want to live without hurting myself. 

1172
01:15:30,538 --> 01:15:33,838
 I want to live without nightmares, and crying, and ... 

1173
01:15:33,839 --> 01:15:37,239
 wake up not knowing where I was and what I did. 

1174
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,639
 I want a friend. 

1175
01:15:43,841 --> 01:15:45,641
 I'm your friend, Sybil. 

1176
01:15:45,842 --> 01:15:49,842
 If you had killed tonight I would greatly miss her. 

1177
01:15:51,643 --> 01:15:55,543
 Sybil, I have an idea, do not know if it will work, but I think ... 

1178
01:15:57,144 --> 01:16:00,344
 Each inside you have an age, right? 

1179
01:16:00,745 --> 01:16:02,245
 Ruthy six years. 

1180
01:16:02,346 --> 01:16:05,846
 Sid 15 years, Vic 18 years. 

1181
01:16:06,147 --> 01:16:08,747
 Everyone is stuck in time, and I think ... 

1182
01:16:08,748 --> 01:16:13,248
 The first step to bring everyone together is doing all the same age. 

1183
01:16:13,349 --> 01:16:15,349
 - Your age. - As? 

1184
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:18,750
 I want permission to hypnotize her. 

1185
01:16:18,751 --> 01:16:22,751
 I know, I know, I promised that we would never do this, but ... 

1186
01:16:23,952 --> 01:16:27,052
 I had so many things I did not understand before, 

1187
01:16:27,053 --> 01:16:29,353
 you do not know me and ... 

1188
01:16:29,354 --> 01:16:32,354
 I did not trust me, but now you trust, right? 

1189
01:16:38,155 --> 01:16:41,355
 - Yes, Doctor. - Good. 

1190
01:16:41,956 --> 01:16:44,856
 And I think we should start this weekend, we can ... 

1191
01:16:44,857 --> 01:16:48,357
 go to my house, the lake, and ... 

1192
01:16:49,458 --> 01:16:51,657
 It's very beautiful. 

1193
01:16:53,559 --> 01:16:58,059
 You are now in a deep state of rest .... 

1194
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,759
 I want you to think on ... 

1195
01:17:01,761 --> 01:17:04,561
 when you were a child and a happy day. 

1196
01:17:04,962 --> 01:17:06,662
 Can you think of? 

1197
01:17:09,463 --> 01:17:11,963
 - Yes. - What was your age? 

1198
01:17:12,064 --> 01:17:13,264
 Three. 

1199
01:17:13,665 --> 01:17:15,665
 And why are you happy? 

1200
01:17:16,566 --> 01:17:19,766
 Because Mom is not bothering me. 

1201
01:17:21,067 --> 01:17:23,367
 It is comforting jacket. 

1202
01:17:23,568 --> 01:17:26,168
 She did not speak for long. 

1203
01:17:27,069 --> 01:17:30,469
 But that's okay, because I can do what I want. 

1204
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:37,470
 Now, when I touch your hand ... 

1205
01:17:37,771 --> 01:17:40,571
 I want to talk to Ruthy, right? 

1206
01:17:48,072 --> 01:17:49,772
 Ruthy. 

1207
01:17:49,973 --> 01:17:53,573
 - You see the little Sybil? - Yes. 

1208
01:17:54,074 --> 01:17:57,674
 Do you see how the little Sybil is happy? 

1209
01:17:58,075 --> 01:17:59,375
 Yes. 

1210
01:17:59,376 --> 01:18:01,576
 You can be happy too. 

1211
01:18:01,977 --> 01:18:05,077
 - Would you like that? - Oh yeah. 

1212
01:18:05,178 --> 01:18:08,378
 You have to grow, you have to be an adult. 

1213
01:18:08,379 --> 01:18:12,679
 You have to have 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 years. 

1214
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:13,680
 That's fine. 

1215
01:18:14,181 --> 01:18:15,181
 And then I can paint, 

1216
01:18:15,182 --> 01:18:18,081
 I can do all the things I can not do now. 

1217
01:18:18,083 --> 01:18:20,982
 Good. Are you ready? 

1218
01:18:20,984 --> 01:18:25,884
 You are growing and growing and growing. 

1219
01:18:40,785 --> 01:18:42,385
 Wow. 

1220
01:18:42,386 --> 01:18:46,386
 And now when you touch your hands I want to talk to Sid. 

1221
01:18:46,487 --> 01:18:47,887
 Right? 

1222
01:18:50,388 --> 01:18:53,188
 - Sid? - Yes. 

1223
01:18:53,689 --> 01:18:55,889
 - How old are you? - 15. 

1224
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:58,389
 You would not want to grow up? 

1225
01:18:58,391 --> 01:18:59,391
 Right. 

1226
01:18:59,592 --> 01:19:02,892
 Except that if I grow up, I'm going to die, I do not want to die. 

1227
01:19:02,893 --> 01:19:04,693
 No, you will not die, Sid. 

1228
01:19:04,694 --> 01:19:07,794
 You will only see the world through different eyes. 

1229
01:19:07,995 --> 01:19:10,595
 - Is ready? - I guess. 

1230
01:19:11,796 --> 01:19:16,396
 Now you have 16, you now have 17, and has 18. 

1231
01:19:16,597 --> 01:19:19,897
 Oh my God. Is my age now. 

1232
01:19:19,898 --> 01:19:22,498
 Yes, Vic, and now it's your turn. 

1233
01:19:22,899 --> 01:19:25,699
 You should not have the age of Sybil? 

1234
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:29,400
 Since you have the memory of all the years that make it age? 

1235
01:19:29,401 --> 01:19:30,800
 I think so. 

1236
01:19:30,902 --> 01:19:33,102
 If you put it that way. 

1237
01:19:33,103 --> 01:19:35,003
 Since you're the pastor, vic. 

1238
01:19:35,004 --> 01:19:37,804
 I want to meet with you all. 

1239
01:19:37,805 --> 01:19:41,305
 Ruthy and Sid, Vanessa and March. 

1240
01:19:41,406 --> 01:19:44,106
 I have to be the Sybil agent? I do not want to grow up. 

1241
01:19:44,107 --> 01:19:48,207
 Peggy, it's easy when all have the same age. 

1242
01:19:54,708 --> 01:19:57,907
 Mary, okay? 

1243
01:20:03,209 --> 01:20:07,108
 I will be able to do the things I like to do ... 

1244
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:10,610
 none of the others go to church, just me? 

1245
01:20:10,611 --> 01:20:13,811
 Of course, you can still go to church. 

1246
01:20:13,812 --> 01:20:16,312
 I will not take anything from you. 

1247
01:20:16,413 --> 01:20:20,413
 Is that you? You'll still be my friend? 

1248
01:20:22,914 --> 01:20:25,514
 Of course I'll still be your friend. 

1249
01:20:27,115 --> 01:20:30,715
 Now you will wake up, and when you do, 

1250
01:20:30,716 --> 01:20:35,416
 all have the same age and share the same memories. 

1251
01:20:35,517 --> 01:20:36,916
 You understand? 

1252
01:20:38,818 --> 01:20:40,518
 You are ready? 

1253
01:20:41,219 --> 01:20:43,019
 All ready? 

1254
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:50,920
 When I touch your hand, you awake. 

1255
01:20:56,721 --> 01:20:58,521
 Sybil? 

1256
01:21:01,222 --> 01:21:03,422
 How do you feel? 

1257
01:21:08,123 --> 01:21:09,322
 Different. 

1258
01:21:11,624 --> 01:21:14,424
 - I can not explain. - It's all right. 

1259
01:21:15,225 --> 01:21:17,225
 What do you remember? 

1260
01:21:18,026 --> 01:21:19,826
 I do not want to think about it. 

1261
01:21:20,827 --> 01:21:24,027
 But you remember a few things now. 

1262
01:21:26,428 --> 01:21:28,428
 But not all are bad memories, right? 

1263
01:21:28,529 --> 01:21:31,629
 It has some memories of good things, right? 

1264
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:33,830
 Like, when you played to dress in the attic. 

1265
01:21:33,831 --> 01:21:37,031
 - When you were happy playing ... - I should not be happy. 

1266
01:21:37,732 --> 01:21:41,632
 - Because? - My mother was sick. 

1267
01:21:41,633 --> 01:21:44,633
 When someone has a mother, you must love her. 

1268
01:21:44,634 --> 01:21:45,934
 Bad girl. 

1269
01:21:45,935 --> 01:21:50,435
 She did not deserve. What she did to you was terrible. 

1270
01:21:50,436 --> 01:21:52,835
 She did not do those things. 

1271
01:21:54,037 --> 01:21:55,737
 Yes, she does. 

1272
01:21:56,238 --> 01:22:01,638
 Because? I do not understand, I loved it. 

1273
01:22:04,339 --> 01:22:05,539
 Mother loves you. 

1274
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:08,840
 I tried to love her. 

1275
01:22:09,841 --> 01:22:12,041
 Even when... 

1276
01:22:13,142 --> 01:22:18,242
 but I could not, I, me, me. I did not. 

1277
01:22:19,243 --> 01:22:20,843
 I think I ... 

1278
01:22:22,144 --> 01:22:23,444
 I hated her. 

1279
01:22:23,845 --> 01:22:27,445
 When she hurt me I want to hurt her back. 

1280
01:22:27,746 --> 01:22:30,746
 God, she should not do those things! 

1281
01:22:30,747 --> 01:22:34,047
 I hate her! I wanted to kill her! 

1282
01:22:34,348 --> 01:22:36,148
 Even if he is my mother! 

1283
01:22:36,449 --> 01:22:41,648
 I want her dead! I want her dead! ... 

1284
01:22:44,950 --> 01:22:48,550
 Oh God. 

1285
01:22:50,351 --> 01:22:52,351
 Oh God. 

1286
01:22:52,352 --> 01:22:55,952
 It WAS CHATTING, FOR MANY YEARS, Sybil has transformed COMPLETELY. 

1287
01:22:55,953 --> 01:22:59,253
 DURING THAT TIME THE DIAGNOSIS, '' MULTIPLE DISORDER IDENTITIES " 

1288
01:22:59,254 --> 01:23:03,554
 It WAS ACEIT0 AS AVAILABLE FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL EVOLUTION. 

1289
01:23:11,355 --> 01:23:13,455
 TWO WOMEN CONTINUED INTIMATE FRIENDS. 

1290
01:23:13,756 --> 01:23:15,956
 BY DOCTOR 1992 WILBUR die. 

1291
01:23:16,057 --> 01:23:18,557
 COLLEAGUES CONTINUED ITS MANY BELIEVING 

1292
01:23:18,958 --> 01:23:20,758
 SHE HERSELF CREATED THOSE CHARACTERS 

1293
01:23:20,759 --> 01:23:23,059
 DESIGNATED BY HIS PATIENT. 

1294
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:53,960

1295
01:23:53,961 --> 01:23:59,161
 Shirley Ardell Mason, WAS THE WOMAN KNOWN AS THE WORLD "SYBIL". 

1296
01:24:02,462 --> 01:24:05,362
 THESE WORKS OF ART, OF DISCOVERED AFTER HIS DEATH, 

1297
01:24:05,363 --> 01:24:08,663
 They WERE RAISED IN SEVERAL STYLES, GIVING SUPPORT TO BELIEVE 

1298
01:24:08,664 --> 01:24:12,464
 WHAT WERE VERY DIFFERENT ARTISTS PAINT ... 

1299
01:24:15,765 --> 01:24:19,265
 ... USING THE SAME HAND.
