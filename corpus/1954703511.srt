1
00:00:29,887 --> 00:00:32,959
Authentic souvenirs.
Come and buy your souvenirs!

2
00:00:37,127 --> 00:00:39,118
(♪ harmonica)

3
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:17,162
How you doing, buddy?

4
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,678
Oh, yeah.

5
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:32,158
Oh, you're so pretty.

6
00:01:35,087 --> 00:01:37,317
- See anything, Jerry?
- (Jerry barks)

7
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:40,001
Some stakeout. Looks dead to me.

8
00:01:44,327 --> 00:01:48,718
Thank you, sir. God bless you. Get that!
God bless you, sir. Thank you.

9
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:51,877
Waiting on Jesus!

10
00:01:52,447 --> 00:01:55,200
Well, our shift is through.

11
00:01:56,047 --> 00:01:58,641
Time to pack it in, my friend.

12
00:01:58,727 --> 00:02:01,002
(Jerry whimpers)

13
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:05,717
Come on, it's not gonna be that bad. It's
starting a new chapter in our life, that's all.

14
00:02:06,087 --> 00:02:10,558
Think about the free time we'll have
to do all the things we wanna do, huh?

15
00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:14,599
So keep an eye on that tambourine.
We're gonna need the cash.

16
00:02:22,087 --> 00:02:24,521
Well, how about that.

17
00:02:25,527 --> 00:02:28,485
Well, I guess we get
to go out in a blaze of glory, huh?

18
00:02:29,687 --> 00:02:30,756
Let's go!

19
00:02:35,887 --> 00:02:38,037
- (horn blares)
- Get out of the way!

20
00:02:43,327 --> 00:02:46,364
Down, Jerry. We're coming in
the back. Go through the front.

21
00:02:46,447 --> 00:02:48,836
We got you, Dooley. We're in the front.

22
00:02:52,447 --> 00:02:55,723
Where's my backup?
Where's my backup? I'm coming in.

23
00:02:56,007 --> 00:02:57,998
I'm a cop, I'm a cop, I'm a cop.

24
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:01,720
Freeze, assholes!

25
00:03:02,287 --> 00:03:04,278
(all) Surprise!

26
00:03:07,207 --> 00:03:09,118
Dooley!

27
00:03:09,207 --> 00:03:12,643
- "Gimme backup! Gimme backup!"
- Think we'd let you go without a party?

28
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:15,400
- Oh, I can't...
- Congratulations, old man!

29
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,796
- Oh...
- It's all downhill from here!

30
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:21,084
- Oh, you guys.
- Officer needs a beer.

31
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:24,523
- Yeah. Give him four beers!
- (Dooley) The officer needs a lot of beer.

32
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:26,802
Happy retirement party, baby!

33
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:29,879
Come here, gimme a kiss! That's right!

34
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:33,084
Well, this is really... a surprise!

35
00:03:35,207 --> 00:03:37,402
(♪ harmonica)

36
00:03:41,607 --> 00:03:43,598
Thank you. That's very nice.

37
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,957
I will put this in my collection.

38
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:50,877
- What's this?
- Don't know. Beautiful box.

39
00:03:50,967 --> 00:03:53,800
This is from... the auto pool.

40
00:03:54,647 --> 00:03:57,559
Well. Hey, look at that.
Hey, how about this?

41
00:03:57,647 --> 00:04:00,525
We put batteries in, so you won't
go a day without a squad car.

42
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:04,156
Oh, that is really cool. Do you wanna
try it? Look, he's already happy.

43
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:06,283
- Fire that thing up.
- Yeah, let's see.

44
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:09,404
- Hey, Jerry Lee. Look at this. You ready?
- (siren)

45
00:04:09,487 --> 00:04:12,206
- (Dooley makes engine noise)
- Look at that! It's a police car.

46
00:04:12,287 --> 00:04:15,438
Come on, Jerry Lee. Come on,
you can get it. Look out, Jerry Lee!

47
00:04:15,527 --> 00:04:17,518
- There it is!
- Oh!

48
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:20,075
Look out! Under your feet,
your feet, your feet!

49
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:23,682
Oh, oh, you got it! You got it!
Oh, don't break it, Jerry!

50
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:26,641
- Come on!
All our toys!

51
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:29,317
Oh, man, you broke it.

52
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:31,637
Come here, boy.

53
00:04:31,727 --> 00:04:35,561
What a good boy. Good boy.
How about that?

54
00:04:35,647 --> 00:04:38,719
Now, this is the last one.
It's from the girls in the dispatch.

55
00:04:38,807 --> 00:04:41,401
- Dispatch! Yeah!
- Well, thank you.

56
00:04:42,687 --> 00:04:46,123
- It's for Jerry Lee's collar.
- That's beautiful.

57
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:50,120
- Very nice. Very nice.
- (Dooley) That's really nice. Look at that.

58
00:04:50,647 --> 00:04:53,764
- It's a picture of you and a picture of me.
- (Jerry barks)

59
00:04:59,447 --> 00:05:02,280
You know I love those guys. I do.

60
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:06,076
But I am so glad this job is over.
I am done being a cop.

61
00:05:06,647 --> 00:05:10,435
I am done with the shoot-outs,
I am done with the fist fights.

62
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,759
Let me tell you, Jerry Lee, the next time
I get punched, bit, kicked or yelled at,

63
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:19,637
it's gonna be because...
because I have a girlfriend!

64
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:31,363
Here. Happy retirement, partner.

65
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:34,920
Attaboy. Attaboy, Jerry Lee.

66
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:37,475
(Jerry Lee burps)

67
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:39,558
My sentiments exactly.

68
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:43,763
- (burps)
- Oh, that's bad breath.

69
00:05:43,847 --> 00:05:46,122
Come on, Dooley. Whoa!

70
00:05:46,207 --> 00:05:49,358
- Come on. Closing time.
- I love you, Petey. I really do.

71
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:52,883
I mean, you're the best friend a man
could have, except for a dog.

72
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:55,322
I love you too,
but we gotta go home. Come on.

73
00:05:55,407 --> 00:05:59,082
I know you're probably right, but just
one more. Jerry Lee wants one more.

74
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,158
One more, just the detectives. Come on.

75
00:06:01,247 --> 00:06:03,715
You got a big day tomorrow.
It's your first day off.

76
00:06:03,807 --> 00:06:08,119
I know. I'm gonna pick up my retirement
cheque, my pension cheque,

77
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:10,960
then, what I'm gonna do,
I'm gonna have my car detailed,

78
00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:14,926
and then Jerry Lee and I... Jerry Lee and I
are gonna hit the road, Jack!

79
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,805
- A vacation? That's nice.
- Why not?

80
00:06:17,887 --> 00:06:20,003
I mean, I already got it mapped out. Yeah.

81
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:22,442
We're gonna go
coast to coast on Route 66.

82
00:06:22,527 --> 00:06:24,995
You're not driving anywhere
until you sleep it off.

83
00:06:25,087 --> 00:06:27,476
- It goes to Chicago, I think.
- That's got a coast.

84
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:29,558
Lake Michigan has a coast.

85
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:39,884
What? What?

86
00:06:43,047 --> 00:06:45,038
What the hell was that?

87
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:50,601
All right, buddy. We slept that off.

88
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:54,079
I feel a little hung over,
but I'm gonna get through that too.

89
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:57,398
I'm gonna get through this retirement.
You and I are out.

90
00:06:57,487 --> 00:06:59,478
We're free! We're out.

91
00:07:00,727 --> 00:07:02,957
- Out... of...
- (engine splutters)

92
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:06,118
Gas.

93
00:07:06,847 --> 00:07:08,838
We're outta gas!

94
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:12,078
Out of gas! I can't believe it.

95
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:18,516
I shouldn't have canceled
that Triple A card. I am so cheap!

96
00:07:19,687 --> 00:07:22,884
All right. We're retired, we're free,
we're just outta gas.

97
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:25,003
You know what?
I'm gonna call a cab!

98
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:30,081
Yes! Retired people ride in cabs
all the time. Where are we?

99
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:32,601
Oh, gimme that cellphone.

100
00:07:33,407 --> 00:07:36,285
Retired people have cellphones!
We'll call a cab!

101
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:38,358
(Dooley dials)

102
00:07:38,447 --> 00:07:41,007
Can you give me the number
of the Yellow Cab Company?

103
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:44,079
- (Jerry Lee barks)
- Hey. Jerry Lee!

104
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:48,078
What's up?

105
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:50,958
Jerry Lee!

106
00:07:56,047 --> 00:07:58,038
What's going on?

107
00:08:00,287 --> 00:08:02,278
What do ya got?

108
00:08:03,127 --> 00:08:05,561
Oh, no. Man!

109
00:08:05,647 --> 00:08:07,922
Let me see.

110
00:08:08,007 --> 00:08:09,998
Just our luck.

111
00:08:10,487 --> 00:08:14,321
OK, buddy. Where are they?
Yeah. Emergency.

112
00:08:35,927 --> 00:08:38,282
Easy. What do ya got?

113
00:08:48,047 --> 00:08:50,277
All right, buddy. These guys are serious.

114
00:09:17,527 --> 00:09:19,518
Easy.

115
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,757
- (door creaks)
- Hold up.

116
00:09:54,287 --> 00:09:55,845
Attaboy.

117
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:01,038
No! Don't sneeze!

118
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:13,682
Jesus! Jerry!

119
00:10:15,287 --> 00:10:17,005
Come on!

120
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:28,238
- Stop! Police! Hold it!
- (gunfire)

121
00:10:39,407 --> 00:10:40,681
Jerry Lee!

122
00:10:53,807 --> 00:10:55,923
Hey! Wait for me!

123
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:00,844
Hey!

124
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:06,435
Get him!

125
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,678
Get this outta here.

126
00:12:07,087 --> 00:12:08,679
Oh, shit.

127
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:10,280
(Jerry Lee barking)

128
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:19,996
Easy, boy.

129
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,800
Ow!

130
00:12:52,727 --> 00:12:55,560
(Jerry Lee barking)

131
00:12:57,407 --> 00:12:58,999
(snarling)

132
00:12:59,087 --> 00:13:01,999
(barking)

133
00:13:35,287 --> 00:13:38,563
- That's mine, dog.
- Jerry Lee! Down!

134
00:13:38,647 --> 00:13:42,765
(Jerry Lee continues barking)

135
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,518
Jerry Lee!

136
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:54,884
Jerry Lee! Jerry Lee, come here.

137
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,923
- Come here. Are you all right?
- Stay where you are!

138
00:13:57,807 --> 00:14:01,004
Hands in the air! Hands in the air!
Now drop your weapon.

139
00:14:01,087 --> 00:14:03,601
- I'm a cop.
- Control that dog. Control that dog!

140
00:14:03,687 --> 00:14:05,882
Drop the weapon.

141
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:08,761
- Heel, Jerry.
- (police radio)

142
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:12,204
- Heel.
- Federal agents. You're under arrest.

143
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:15,040
- For what?
- It's all right. Now, calm down.

144
00:14:15,127 --> 00:14:16,446
That's the one.

145
00:14:17,647 --> 00:14:21,196
You guys make it a practice to arrest
officers while you're doing backup?

146
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:24,484
- Mighty fine police work.
- You're cocky for a cop who got busted.

147
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:27,400
Busted? Are you suggesting
I'm involved in this?

148
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:30,399
- Got a different point of view?
- Let's hear it.

149
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,806
I was on my way home.
I observed a 2-11 in progress.

150
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:36,082
- Observed?
- Jerry Lee heard something.

151
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,920
- The dog heard something?
- We approached the premises.

152
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:41,885
I found a dead security guard
and I called it in. I went in.

153
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:44,686
I found another dead guard.
Jerry Lee tracked the perps,

154
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:47,565
we observed them in
their heist, they heard us,

155
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:50,844
they fled, I followed in pursuit,
the one guy killed the other guy,

156
00:14:50,927 --> 00:14:54,886
and took off while you guys and your
three-ring circus were arresting me.

157
00:14:54,967 --> 00:14:57,435
And the perp who escaped?
What'd he look like?

158
00:14:57,527 --> 00:15:02,043
Six foot, 185 pounds, skilled shooter,
agile, I'd say a military background.

159
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:05,517
- Distinguishing features?
- Couldn’t tell. Had gloves and a mask.

160
00:15:05,607 --> 00:15:07,757
- Just like the dead guy.
- Any idea what he was after?

161
00:15:07,847 --> 00:15:11,203
Gosh, I'm sorry, guys.
I was gonna make him tea and biscuits

162
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:13,642
and have a chat,
but they were trying to kill me.

163
00:15:13,727 --> 00:15:16,605
Wanna find out what they stole?
Ask the labs, or better yet,

164
00:15:16,687 --> 00:15:20,680
find the guy you lost, and quit
sweating my ass. I was just doing my job.

165
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:22,200
- Your job?
- You have no job.

166
00:15:22,287 --> 00:15:25,006
- As of midnight you were retired.
- You're a civilian.

167
00:15:25,087 --> 00:15:29,205
A civilian who's now mixed up
in a serious federal investigation.

168
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,166
(Jerry Lee growls)

169
00:15:36,927 --> 00:15:38,918
Calm down. Calm down.

170
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,357
You don't worry about a thing, now.

171
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:47,640
They got nothing on us.
What can they possibly do, huh?

172
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:50,961
What?! They froze my pension?!

173
00:15:51,047 --> 00:15:53,277
Tough luck, Dooley.
It's department policy.

174
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:56,518
You'll get it when the
Department of Justice closes its case.

175
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:59,041
Those clowns couldn't
close their own zipper!

176
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:02,164
- I'll be dead before I see that money.
- It's out of my hands.

177
00:16:02,247 --> 00:16:06,365
- It's a federal issue now.
- They have no idea who he is, how to...

178
00:16:06,447 --> 00:16:09,359
The only way I'll get my pension
back is find the guy myself.

179
00:16:09,447 --> 00:16:13,565
Oh, no. No way, uh-uh.
Look, you are retired now, Dooley.

180
00:16:13,647 --> 00:16:15,763
- You're not a cop any more. Clear?
- Yes, sir.

181
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:19,726
Then go home! Practice your whittling.
Take a cooking class or something.

182
00:16:19,807 --> 00:16:22,401
But you stay out of this!

183
00:16:22,487 --> 00:16:24,603
No problem, sir. Sir.

184
00:16:25,007 --> 00:16:27,077
Sure. No problem.

185
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:31,285
We're really sorry. If there's anything we
can do for you, you just say the word.

186
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:34,279
Well, actually, could you
spout me a hundred bucks?

187
00:16:34,367 --> 00:16:36,358
Wife's birthday. Can't do it.

188
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:39,438
Hey, Petey, old pal.

189
00:16:39,807 --> 00:16:43,243
Can you spout me a couple of hundred
bucks, just to tide me over?

190
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:46,637
- I'm still paying off the boat.
- Yeah. Sure, I understand.

191
00:16:46,727 --> 00:16:49,116
Hey, everybody... Hey, listen up.

192
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:51,596
Listen, you know, uh... I'm embarrassed.

193
00:16:51,687 --> 00:16:55,475
As humiliating as it sounds,
I'm kind of in a financial jam, and...

194
00:16:56,527 --> 00:17:01,157
I was wondering if anybody could lend,
you know, one of your own

195
00:17:01,247 --> 00:17:06,526
two hundred bucks to see me through
this difficult transition to retirement.

196
00:17:07,607 --> 00:17:12,397
It would be, you know, a great
opportunity for you, now, to say so.

197
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:14,758
Anybody?

198
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:18,602
You still got your PI license, don't you?

199
00:17:18,687 --> 00:17:20,564
- Yeah.
- So use that.

200
00:17:20,647 --> 00:17:23,115
Terrific. What am I gonna
live on in the meantime?

201
00:17:23,207 --> 00:17:25,437
- What are you doing, fella?
- (Jerry Lee whines)

202
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:28,883
- Hey, what about breeding Jerry Lee?
- Pimp Jerry Lee?

203
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:32,323
- Yeah.
- I can't. He's a champion police dog.

204
00:17:32,407 --> 00:17:36,161
People are looking for decorated sires
like Jerry Lee all the time.

205
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:39,879
I hear you can get $1500 a pop.

206
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,518
1500 bucks a pop?

207
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:46,196
Hello! Hi! Dog owners?

208
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,167
Dog owners? Hi!

209
00:17:49,247 --> 00:17:53,718
Uh... Any of you looking to breed,
you know, for puppies...

210
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:57,925
Cute little puppies? You know,
the cute little furry things?

211
00:17:58,007 --> 00:18:00,362
I got a champion dog right here.

212
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,802
Here's the dad, right here.

213
00:18:02,887 --> 00:18:06,562
He is a stud. And... and he's hot to breed.

214
00:18:06,927 --> 00:18:09,521
Hey there, handsome. Looking to stud?

215
00:18:09,607 --> 00:18:12,804
Oh, uh... I'm sorry,
I think you have the wrong idea.

216
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:15,481
- I was just talking to your dog.
- Oh!

217
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:17,922
Jerry! Uh, I'm sorry.

218
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:21,636
- Maurice Charles. Professional breeder.
- Oh.

219
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:24,116
This is Champion.
He thinks he's a big dog.

220
00:18:24,207 --> 00:18:28,644
Breeder, huh? That's great. I'm Thomas
Dooley. This is my dog Jerry Lee.

221
00:18:28,727 --> 00:18:31,366
Oh! Please! Mr Tough Guy, huh?

222
00:18:31,447 --> 00:18:34,564
- Yeah, well, he's a big one.
- He's got remarkable structure.

223
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:37,400
- And just the loveliest markings.
- Thank you very much.

224
00:18:37,487 --> 00:18:39,478
- Does he have his papers?
- Uh, papers?

225
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:43,765
- American Kennel Club, Schutzen titles?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. I got papers.

226
00:18:43,847 --> 00:18:45,917
I mean, this is a champion police dog.

227
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:48,919
- A-1. I mean, decorated dog.
- You don't say!

228
00:18:49,007 --> 00:18:51,919
- A stud! He's a stud!
- You should come by my place.

229
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:54,123
- Say around... three?
- Three?

230
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:57,040
- I've some clients you should meet.
- That'd be great.

231
00:18:57,287 --> 00:18:59,596
- Let's go poop.
- Thank you, Maurice.

232
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:04,880
Did you hear that? I don't care
what you think. This is non-negotiable.

233
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:30,199
- Did you bring the chips?
- They're at home in my safe.

234
00:19:30,287 --> 00:19:33,085
Oh, yeah? All of 'em?

235
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:35,397
Including the alpha?

236
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:38,758
You surprise me, Frankie.

237
00:19:40,327 --> 00:19:42,602
When did you take
an interest in computers?

238
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:47,283
About the minute I heard you were
having a problem at the lab, Mr Thyer.

239
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:49,483
Don't worry about it.
It's being handled.

240
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:52,240
Good. Because my client doesn't like risk.

241
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:57,715
You got till the end of the week.
After that, no deal.

242
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:06,445
Tell your client
he'll get his precious microchips,

243
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,200
but the price just doubled
for his lack of faith.

244
00:20:26,287 --> 00:20:28,437
Mr Dooley.

245
00:20:29,847 --> 00:20:31,917
- Mr Dooley?
- Yes.

246
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:36,078
- Yes. Maurice, how are you?
- Hi.

247
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:38,635
- What a lovely home you have here.
- Thank you.

248
00:20:38,727 --> 00:20:41,002
It set you back a few bucks, huh?

249
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,796
Detective Dooley, I'd like you to meet
Jack and Jackie Von Jarvis,

250
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:47,003
- and their bitch Jacqueline.
- How do you do?

251
00:20:47,087 --> 00:20:50,204
- Great, thanks.
- Hello. Alert you a pretty dog!

252
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:52,519
Yes!

253
00:20:53,447 --> 00:20:56,007
- Oh, that's...
- Well, it's... it's so nice...

254
00:20:57,807 --> 00:21:00,037
to meet you, uh...

255
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:02,846
How old is Jacqueline?
Get your nose outta my ass!

256
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:05,441
- What's your problem?
- Did you bring his papers?

257
00:21:05,527 --> 00:21:07,279
- Yes.
- Good.

258
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:10,439
I mean, they're not all, um...
I got some coffee stains on 'em,

259
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,883
but you can see that
he's a really nicely bred dog.

260
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:17,004
Um, there you go.
There's his papers, right here.

261
00:21:17,807 --> 00:21:20,719
- Jerry Lee. Excuse me. Jerry Lee!
- (Jackie) Absolutely not.

262
00:21:20,807 --> 00:21:23,924
We cannot possibly breed
our Jacqueline with this unruly mate.

263
00:21:24,007 --> 00:21:27,682
We demand nothing less than perfection!
Isn't that right, girl, hm?

264
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:33,080
Yes, isn't it? No, we don't like the bad
dogs! No, we don't like the bad...

265
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:38,958
No, we don't like bad things.
We don't like the dirty dogs, do we? No!

Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. Sit, Molly.
Good girl.

Detective Thomas Dooley, Jerry Lee...
Catherine Coleman and Molly.

- Hi.
- Hi.

282
00:22:38,007 --> 00:22:39,076
- Catherine?
- Yeah.

283
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:42,159
Uh... Why would you and Molly
wanna have puppies?

284
00:22:42,247 --> 00:22:45,523
My sisters each have kids, and I wanted
to give each one of them a puppy.

285
00:22:45,607 --> 00:22:50,840
German shepherds are so protective. So I
was hoping we could work something out.

286
00:22:50,927 --> 00:22:54,920
- Well, I, uh...

287
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:57,965
I don't see why not. Where do we sign?

288
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:11,358
OK, partner. We're home.

289
00:23:11,447 --> 00:23:13,438
(Jerry Lee groans)

290
00:23:16,207 --> 00:23:19,438
Come on. Come on!

291
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:22,278
Come on. Let's go.

292
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,881
What's with you, riding in the back seat?

293
00:23:24,967 --> 00:23:28,403
You know, you've been weird all day.
You all right?

294
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:31,437
Come on. Let's go.

295
00:23:33,127 --> 00:23:35,357
You wanna stay here tonight?

296
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:38,245
Fine. Stay there. I'm going in.

297
00:23:38,327 --> 00:23:40,716
I wanna get something to eat.

298
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:44,245
Some pizza, some miso soup.

299
00:23:44,687 --> 00:23:47,485
You stay there tonight. Bye!

300
00:23:48,687 --> 00:23:50,678
Come on!

301
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:53,800
Leash?

302
00:23:53,887 --> 00:23:56,037
Good boy.

303
00:23:56,967 --> 00:24:01,324
You know, I got you for free. I can go to
the pound and get another one for free.

304
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:04,160
With this attitude like this,
I just might do that.

305
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:08,518
(squeaking noises/shouting)

306
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:11,044
Ah!

307
00:24:12,127 --> 00:24:14,561
You're hurting me!

308
00:24:18,327 --> 00:24:20,397
You got bad, bad gums.

309
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:24,121
Pizza in there, or something. That's it.

310
00:24:29,087 --> 00:24:30,156
Mm!

311
00:24:32,087 --> 00:24:33,315
- Hi.
- Hi.

312
00:24:37,007 --> 00:24:39,646
- This is for you.
- Thanks.

313
00:24:39,887 --> 00:24:41,878
Come on in.

314
00:24:43,927 --> 00:24:47,203
- Using the dog as cover.
- Clever.

315
00:24:48,127 --> 00:24:50,436
Very clever.

316
00:24:50,527 --> 00:24:52,995
Come on, Jerry. Come on.
Have a seat. Please...

317
00:24:53,087 --> 00:24:55,555
Thanks. Sit, Molly.

318
00:24:55,647 --> 00:24:59,435
- Good girl.
- Uh, Molly, this is Jerry Lee.

319
00:24:59,527 --> 00:25:01,518
- Jerry...
- (growls)

320
00:25:04,727 --> 00:25:07,685
Uh... Is there something wrong?

321
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:10,327
No, nothing.

322
00:25:11,527 --> 00:25:14,121
I'll just be a second.

323
00:25:15,367 --> 00:25:17,881
Jerry Lee! What's the matter with you?

324
00:25:19,087 --> 00:25:22,238
Come on, I know you're nervous,
and you just met this dog,

325
00:25:22,327 --> 00:25:25,842
but this is how you guys do it
in your world. You meet, you do it!

326
00:25:25,927 --> 00:25:28,157
Excuse me. Is there a problem here?

327
00:25:28,247 --> 00:25:31,956
No, I just think he's a little nervous.
It's the first time he's ever done it.

328
00:25:32,047 --> 00:25:36,120
I think what he needs is a little...
professional assistance.

329
00:25:36,207 --> 00:25:38,437
Why don't you let me help him?

330
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:41,117
Help? You mean, help?

331
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,596
- Help. Yes.
- I'll talk to him.

332
00:25:44,047 --> 00:25:47,357
Come here. Look at me. Listen,
you gotta do this for the team, man.

333
00:25:47,447 --> 00:25:51,122
You gotta step up. You gotta look
at that girl and make it happen.

334
00:25:51,207 --> 00:25:53,596
Come on. We need the cash.

335
00:25:53,687 --> 00:25:56,155
You understand that?
We need the money.

336
00:25:56,247 --> 00:26:00,365
Believe me, you don't want the
alternative. You want Maurice...

337
00:26:01,567 --> 00:26:03,558
Huh?

338
00:26:04,767 --> 00:26:07,679
All right, then. Just pretend!

339
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:10,600
Pretend it's... uh...

340
00:26:12,007 --> 00:26:15,522
Come on!
Don't fight me on this one. Come on!

341
00:26:15,967 --> 00:26:19,118
- Are you sure about this?
- Trust me. She's just his type.

342
00:26:19,207 --> 00:26:21,596
Come on. Take a look.
Will you just take a look?

343
00:26:25,207 --> 00:26:27,277
Pretty, huh? You like her?

344
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:29,358
She likes you.

345
00:26:37,927 --> 00:26:42,284
OK, so, half now and half when we know if
it took, less my handling fee, of course.

346
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:46,804
- Thank you very much.
- Well, my work here is done.

347
00:26:46,887 --> 00:26:49,321
- I'll be in touch.
- OK.

348
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:52,080
Stud! You're a stud!

349
00:26:53,047 --> 00:26:55,242
Hi, Molly. I'm so sorry about the costume.

350
00:26:55,327 --> 00:26:57,522
- But I told you it would work, didn't I?
- Yeah.

351
00:26:57,607 --> 00:27:00,485
- You'll give me one of the pups?
- The pick of the litter.

352
00:27:00,567 --> 00:27:02,683
- Really?
- Yeah.

353
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:06,646
Jeez, look at this. A truck.
You drive a truck!

354
00:27:06,727 --> 00:27:08,718
- Yeah.
- I mean, I know, it's just...

355
00:27:08,807 --> 00:27:11,719
- You don't see, you know, many...
- Women driving pick-ups.

356
00:27:11,807 --> 00:27:13,877
- Well, you just don't, that's all.
- Yeah.

357
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:17,437
Well, see, I do a lot of gardening,
some landscape architecture.

358
00:27:17,527 --> 00:27:20,519
- So it comes in handy.
- Well, you know, I love plants.

359
00:27:20,607 --> 00:27:22,598
And trees.

360
00:27:23,447 --> 00:27:25,642
Sycamores.

361
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,718
Elm.

362
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:30,598
Willows.

363
00:27:31,207 --> 00:27:33,277
- Shrubs.
- Shrubs.

364
00:27:33,367 --> 00:27:35,597
Shrubs.

365
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:38,201
- OK.
- Nice doing business with you.

366
00:27:38,287 --> 00:27:40,198
- Yeah.
- We'll see you again.

367
00:27:40,287 --> 00:27:42,323
Bye!

368
00:27:42,407 --> 00:27:44,398
Bye-bye!

369
00:27:47,527 --> 00:27:49,995
Ha, ha ha! Oh, yeah!

370
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:54,205
Look at this, buddy.
Look at all this money!

371
00:27:54,287 --> 00:27:58,678
You know what I think we're gonna do?
I think we're gonna reinvest in ourselves.

372
00:27:58,767 --> 00:28:03,522
We're gonna go to the newspaper,
put an ad in for our PI business...

373
00:28:03,607 --> 00:28:07,122
Just until we get the pension cheque.
No, no. You can't spend money.

374
00:28:07,207 --> 00:28:11,041
No, no, no. It's not yours. I'll get
you some kibble out of it, all right?

375
00:28:11,127 --> 00:28:13,118
Look at that.

376
00:28:21,927 --> 00:28:23,519
I don't like that dog.

377
00:28:26,647 --> 00:28:30,435
- Why are you guys tailing me?
- You're a suspect in an investigation.

378
00:28:30,527 --> 00:28:32,916
- And it's our job.
- I gave you everything I know.

379
00:28:33,007 --> 00:28:35,157
You already screwed up my pension.

380
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:38,922
Hey, you wanna do me a favour?
Leave me alone for the rest of my life.

381
00:28:39,007 --> 00:28:40,884
- Sorry, Dooley.
- No can do.

382
00:28:40,967 --> 00:28:43,197
Rules are rules.

383
00:28:50,847 --> 00:28:52,838
I can't believe you did that!

384
00:28:57,327 --> 00:28:59,557
The dog bit the Tyre.

385
00:28:59,647 --> 00:29:01,638
Hey! See ya!

386
00:29:02,287 --> 00:29:04,039
Good boy, Jerry.

387
00:29:13,047 --> 00:29:15,038
Look at this guy.

388
00:29:18,287 --> 00:29:20,278
Don't wave back.

389
00:29:23,447 --> 00:29:25,438
Morning, assholes!

390
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:29,076
That is it!

391
00:29:41,727 --> 00:29:43,763
Oh. Oh, how terrible.

392
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:49,760
- Suckers.
- No! It's not worth the suit, man.

393
00:29:49,847 --> 00:29:51,838
Come on!

394
00:29:52,527 --> 00:29:54,518
Not worth the suit!

395
00:29:56,807 --> 00:29:59,241
Here it is, here it is, here it is.

396
00:29:59,327 --> 00:30:02,478
"K-9 Private Investigator at your service."

397
00:30:03,327 --> 00:30:06,922
"Need to collect a loan?
Worried about loved... ones..."

398
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:11,556
What are you doing up there?
All right. That's it.

399
00:30:11,647 --> 00:30:13,877
We're definitely going to the vet. Now.

400
00:30:13,967 --> 00:30:15,958
There's your problem. Right there.

401
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:19,164
Jerry Lee swallowed
something he shouldn't have.

402
00:30:19,967 --> 00:30:21,559
- He's constipated?
- Very.

403
00:30:21,647 --> 00:30:24,241
- What the hell is it?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

404
00:30:24,327 --> 00:30:28,366
Give it a few days. It'll pass. When it does,
give me a call. I'd like to know what it is.

405
00:30:28,447 --> 00:30:31,564
In the meantime, you might wanna
buy some air freshener.

406
00:30:31,647 --> 00:30:33,638
Air freshener?

407
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:36,123
(farting)

408
00:30:36,207 --> 00:30:38,198
Stop that!

409
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:44,158
(farting)

410
00:30:45,727 --> 00:30:48,639
What the hell did you eat?
What did you swallow?

411
00:30:49,607 --> 00:30:52,246
- For crying out loud.
- (doorbell)

412
00:30:52,327 --> 00:30:54,397
Probably those assholes out there.

413
00:30:54,487 --> 00:30:57,445
Jesus! Phew.

414
00:30:57,807 --> 00:30:59,923
No, you can't use my can...

415
00:31:00,007 --> 00:31:03,283
I help you?
- I'm sorry. Did I come at a bad time?

416
00:31:03,727 --> 00:31:07,197
- No, no. No.
- Well, I was looking for Thomas Dooley.

417
00:31:07,287 --> 00:31:11,599
- K-9 Private Investigators?
- Yes. That's me.

418
00:31:11,687 --> 00:31:14,520
Come in, please.
Please, please, come in.

419
00:31:20,007 --> 00:31:21,998
There you go. It's clean.

420
00:31:23,327 --> 00:31:25,318
OK. So.

421
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,959
- You need a private investigator?
- I, uh...

422
00:31:32,047 --> 00:31:35,483
- I don't really know where to begin.
- Well, just start. You know. Just go.

423
00:31:35,567 --> 00:31:38,240
I think something horrible
has happened to my fiancé.

424
00:31:38,327 --> 00:31:42,036
- Oh.
- He disappeared a week ago.

425
00:31:42,127 --> 00:31:44,163
- A week ago?
- Yeah.

426
00:31:44,247 --> 00:31:47,080
- Well, has this happened before?
- No, never.

427
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:50,364
We were in the middle of...
wedding plans,

428
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:55,645
at dinner, and we had
an argument over the invitations.

429
00:31:57,247 --> 00:32:01,684
Well, he stormed out of the restaurant, and
I... I called him all night on his cell,

430
00:32:01,767 --> 00:32:03,883
the whole next day.

431
00:32:03,967 --> 00:32:06,162
Nobody answered.

432
00:32:06,247 --> 00:32:08,966
And that was the last time I saw him.

433
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:13,523
Here.

434
00:32:15,887 --> 00:32:17,878
- Here. Please.
- Thanks.

435
00:32:17,967 --> 00:32:21,562
It's... it's, you know, dirty.
I mean, it's clean enough.

436
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:30,284
(clears throat)
So, look. We're gonna find him.

437
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:34,963
He's out there. Now, does
your future husband have a name?

438
00:32:35,047 --> 00:32:38,437
- Kevin Wingate.
- Wingate.

439
00:32:38,527 --> 00:32:41,087
Now, did he owe any money,
does he have any enemies?

440
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:44,079
Kevin? No. It's impossible.

441
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:47,159
He's never been anything
but kind and reliable.

442
00:32:47,247 --> 00:32:49,966
- Respons...
- (farting)

443
00:32:50,047 --> 00:32:51,446
(growling)

444
00:32:52,407 --> 00:32:55,877
(clears throat) I'm gonna need
some more specific information.

445
00:32:55,967 --> 00:32:59,118
Uh, do you have any kind
of social security numbers, or...

446
00:32:59,207 --> 00:33:03,166
It's everything I could think of.
Social security numbers, phone numbers.

447
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:07,923
Old credit card receipts, email.
The photo is from our engagement party.

448
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:12,921
Please find him. Money is no object.

449
00:33:14,047 --> 00:33:17,005
Well, I'm glad you brought that up.
It's kind of expensive.

450
00:33:17,087 --> 00:33:21,683
It's $100 an hour plus expenses. I can
show receipts for all the expense...

451
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:24,804
Will $1,000 be enough for a retainer?

452
00:33:27,527 --> 00:33:30,087
- It'll work.
- (farting)

453
00:33:35,007 --> 00:33:36,565
- Oh.
- Oh!

454
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:38,638
Just step over him.

455
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:40,958
Jerry Lee.

456
00:33:41,487 --> 00:33:45,799
Thank you, Detective. I feel better
already. And I'm not usually like this.

457
00:33:45,887 --> 00:33:49,197
Oh, well, as soon as I find something,
I'll be glad to give you a call.

458
00:33:49,287 --> 00:33:51,676
How do I find you?

459
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:55,601
Here's my card.

460
00:33:55,687 --> 00:33:59,282
Well, Laura, don't you worry.
You're in good hands, and paws.

461
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:03,000
- Is he all right?
- Yeah. He's just a little jet-lagged.

462
00:34:03,087 --> 00:34:06,318
He gets a little weird. When he gets
some rest he'll be on the job.

463
00:34:06,407 --> 00:34:10,286
- No better sleuth than Jerry Lee.
- If you say so, Detective.

464
00:34:10,367 --> 00:34:13,245
- Please, find Kevin.
- Yes.

465
00:34:20,047 --> 00:34:22,641
Why must you do that
when I'm with a client?

466
00:34:23,407 --> 00:34:28,435
What is with you?
It's gonna be a long night.

467
00:34:28,807 --> 00:34:30,798
Kevin Wingate.

468
00:34:31,327 --> 00:34:36,799
Princeton undergrad, Harvard MBA,
lettered both in golf and tennis.

469
00:34:36,887 --> 00:34:38,878
(Jerry Lee farts)

470
00:34:44,247 --> 00:34:48,320
Investment banker.
Holdings in major companies.

471
00:34:48,407 --> 00:34:52,958
- (farting)
- You stink.

472
00:34:53,727 --> 00:34:55,126
Beans.

473
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:59,366
Oh, yeah. This'll make it happen.

474
00:34:59,447 --> 00:35:01,438
How about this? Cabbage?

475
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,759
That's good.
That'll blow it out for you. Prunes?

476
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:08,444
Just one?

477
00:35:08,527 --> 00:35:10,483
OK. Just one.

478
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:11,886
All right.

479
00:35:13,327 --> 00:35:16,160
Dodger Dog. Yeah. Oh, yeah!

480
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,966
This looks like mineral oil, but it's not.

481
00:35:19,047 --> 00:35:21,402
Mineral oil.

482
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:24,081
Curry powder.

483
00:35:25,047 --> 00:35:26,196
Hot!

484
00:35:27,887 --> 00:35:30,082
Mm! OK, buddy. Ready?

485
00:35:30,167 --> 00:35:33,284
Oh, yeah! That's good. That's good!

486
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:36,322
That's gonna make it happen, brother.

487
00:35:36,407 --> 00:35:39,205
Pizza! Mm!

488
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,883
Look at that!

489
00:35:45,527 --> 00:35:48,644
How's that look? You like that? Huh?

490
00:35:48,727 --> 00:35:51,480
Mm! Here we go. Come on.

491
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,558
Come on.

492
00:35:54,447 --> 00:35:56,438
(groans)

493
00:35:57,687 --> 00:36:00,201
I know this is killing you, Jer.

494
00:36:00,287 --> 00:36:03,802
But trust me.
You're gonna thank me in the morning.

495
00:36:07,087 --> 00:36:09,760
- You want some Alka-Seltzer?
- (whines)

496
00:36:09,847 --> 00:36:12,202
- Want some Alka-Seltzer?
- (groans)

497
00:36:12,287 --> 00:36:13,800
I'll get you some Alka-Seltzer.

498
00:36:23,687 --> 00:36:25,678
All right. Go poo-poo.

499
00:36:26,887 --> 00:36:29,845
Come on. Hurry up. Poo-poo. Ca-ca.

500
00:36:30,287 --> 00:36:32,755
You want some privacy, is that it?

501
00:36:36,807 --> 00:36:39,560
Go on. I'm not watching.

502
00:36:40,927 --> 00:36:42,918
Go ahead.

503
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:47,763
I'll park my butt right here.
You work your butt.

504
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:53,119
- (Jerry Lee whines)
- Come on, hurry up.

505
00:36:53,207 --> 00:36:55,596
I'm freezing my nuts off here.

506
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:58,358
(loud farting)

507
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:11,996
Hey! Hey, Sparky. Sparky!
Sparkster! Get back here!

508
00:37:12,087 --> 00:37:14,078
Jerry Lee?

509
00:37:18,087 --> 00:37:20,476
See? What did I tell ya?

510
00:37:20,567 --> 00:37:23,479
Pizza! You feel better?

511
00:37:43,207 --> 00:37:45,198
Oh, man.

512
00:37:46,207 --> 00:37:49,005
Ugh... Jerry Lee...

513
00:37:58,447 --> 00:38:00,085
What's this?

514
00:38:02,207 --> 00:38:05,404
- So, Sato, what is it?
- Don't know who you're hanging out with,

515
00:38:05,487 --> 00:38:08,001
but you've got
some very smart friends, brother.

516
00:38:08,087 --> 00:38:12,000
Check this out, man. This is a beta-test
schematic of your microchip.

517
00:38:12,087 --> 00:38:15,045
See these design patterns
and all those extra lines of code?

518
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:16,162
- There?
- Yeah.

519
00:38:16,247 --> 00:38:19,557
This has been in development for years,
but no one's cracked it.

520
00:38:19,647 --> 00:38:22,366
- Until now?
- You got it, man. This device?

521
00:38:22,447 --> 00:38:25,041
Light years ahead
of anything I've even read about.

522
00:38:25,127 --> 00:38:27,766
Hm. It's worth something, then, huh?

523
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,202
You'd be stoked
if you had the whole string.

524
00:38:30,287 --> 00:38:33,563
This is what we call an alpha.
It's like the big kahuna of microchips.

525
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:37,322
It contains command data that allows
the slave chips to function properly.

526
00:38:37,407 --> 00:38:40,877
From these design patterns,
there's three more chips that go with it.

527
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:43,561
With all four,
there's no telling what you could do.

528
00:38:43,647 --> 00:38:45,638
OK. Pretend I got 'em.

529
00:38:47,287 --> 00:38:50,165
- What then?
- Put the technology on the market,

530
00:38:50,247 --> 00:38:52,317
start a whole new generation
of computers.

531
00:38:52,407 --> 00:38:55,558
And the bottom would
fall out of a billion-dollar industry.

532
00:38:55,647 --> 00:38:58,002
- Bingo.
- Yeah.

533
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:01,078
Tom, you're not on the job any more.

534
00:39:01,167 --> 00:39:04,079
What's the matter with a couple
of guys just shooting the bull?

535
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:06,635
Timmons, I need
to get clear on this FBI thing.

536
00:39:06,727 --> 00:39:08,957
What do you wanna know, Dooley?

537
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:14,167
Thank you, Carlos. OK. I need some
information on that heist at Al Microlabs.

538
00:39:14,247 --> 00:39:18,126
For some reason I keep thinking
that I've heard of that place before.

539
00:39:18,207 --> 00:39:20,926
Isn't that the same place
that had that fire last year?

540
00:39:21,007 --> 00:39:22,725
- Fire?
- Yeah.

541
00:39:22,807 --> 00:39:26,846
A while back. Arson thought it was set.
Insurance companies didn't wanna settle.

542
00:39:26,927 --> 00:39:29,316
Everyone working the case
had to sign a statement.

543
00:39:29,407 --> 00:39:32,638
It turned into this big litigation deal.
We had to sign a statement.

544
00:39:32,727 --> 00:39:36,163
- Was there a suspect?
- Dooley! What are you doing here?

545
00:39:36,927 --> 00:39:39,566
Captain Thomas!
I just brought some doughnuts.

546
00:39:39,647 --> 00:39:42,081
- Would you like some?
- No, I don't want a doughnut.

547
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:44,806
- And this area is for detectives only.
- Yes, sir.

548
00:39:44,887 --> 00:39:47,799
- Come on, Captain. He's still one of us.
- Shut up, Timmons!

549
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:52,085
And you. You listen to me.
You are under investigation.

550
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:54,681
Not me, not the department. You!

551
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:58,555
Which is why I don't wanna see you
or Jerry Lee anywhere near this place

552
00:39:58,647 --> 00:40:01,684
until your name is cleared.
Is that understood?

553
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:03,883
Yes, sir.

554
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:06,242
No? OK. Come on, Jerry Lee.

555
00:40:06,327 --> 00:40:10,445
- We're not welcome here any more.
- What the hell is it with you two?

556
00:40:10,527 --> 00:40:15,476
Don't you understand basic police
procedure? The man is retired!

557
00:40:15,567 --> 00:40:19,401
He is under investigation!
He is not allowed in this area!

558
00:40:19,487 --> 00:40:22,638
Question. Whens the last time
you walked a beat?

559
00:40:22,727 --> 00:40:25,241
Keep this up, you'll be
renewing old acquaintances.

560
00:40:25,327 --> 00:40:29,366
- Stay low. Stay low.
- Next time you question my authority,

561
00:40:29,447 --> 00:40:32,837
you're gonna be taking a little vacation
of your own, you hear me?

562
00:40:32,927 --> 00:40:36,715
- Cuesta, wipe that smirk off your face.
- OK. Jerry Lee, you sit here.

563
00:40:37,047 --> 00:40:41,006
Parking violations! And I'm sick of you
eating your lunches in the squad room.

564
00:40:41,087 --> 00:40:44,523
What is that, anyway?
Smells like onion enchilada!

565
00:40:44,847 --> 00:40:48,556
When I come back, I wanna see
you guys doing some real work!

566
00:40:59,807 --> 00:41:01,365
Come on. Come on.

567
00:41:02,887 --> 00:41:05,162
Hey, Jerry Lee!

568
00:41:05,247 --> 00:41:07,715
What are you doing here?

569
00:41:07,807 --> 00:41:09,798
Good boy.

570
00:41:13,607 --> 00:41:15,677
Oh, yeah, thanks for the warning.

571
00:41:32,447 --> 00:41:36,281
OK. Come on, let's go. Easy. Easy.

572
00:41:36,367 --> 00:41:39,598
- Oh.
- Dooley. Why are you still here?

573
00:41:40,447 --> 00:41:43,166
- I had to pee.
- Why am I still talking to you?

574
00:41:43,247 --> 00:41:46,364
- Go pee somewhere else! Get outta here!
- Yes, sir.

575
00:41:48,167 --> 00:41:50,886
What the dog sees in him I'll never know.

576
00:41:51,607 --> 00:41:53,598

00:42:04,127 --> 00:42:05,276

Aah! Hey, hey!
Hey, what, are you crazy, man?

650
00:47:14,847 --> 00:47:19,637
OK, I'll talk, all right? I'll talk. Whatever
you want. Just be cool. Don't drop me!

651
00:47:19,727 --> 00:47:22,287
Why were you a suspect
in the Al Microlabs fire?

652
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:25,245
It was a setup, all right?
They knew I had a record.

653
00:47:25,327 --> 00:47:28,524
Oh, like thousands of guys
like to play with fire!

654
00:47:28,607 --> 00:47:30,882
- I was approached by a guy.
- A guy. What guy?

655
00:47:30,967 --> 00:47:34,004
I don't know what kinda guy!
OK? A good-looking guy!

656
00:47:34,087 --> 00:47:36,885
- Uh, he wore fancy clothes.
- Pretty guy!

657
00:47:36,967 --> 00:47:39,606
- Frankie the Fence made the connect.
- You know him?

658
00:47:39,687 --> 00:47:41,678
What do you want?
Frankie or the guy?

659
00:47:41,767 --> 00:47:44,122
- The guy, wise guy! The guy!
- OK!

660
00:47:44,207 --> 00:47:46,402
- OK!
- The name!

661
00:47:46,487 --> 00:47:48,842
I don't know! It was, like, a year ago.

662
00:47:48,927 --> 00:47:50,918
You buying that, Jerry Lee?

663
00:47:51,207 --> 00:47:53,675
- You buy these? Bad fashion statement.
- Don't...

664
00:47:53,767 --> 00:47:57,442
- Oh! I lost my grip! I lost my grip!
- Oh, my God. Oh, God!

665
00:47:57,527 --> 00:47:59,961
- Give me the name!
- OK!

666
00:48:00,047 --> 00:48:03,357
I think it was Shyer. Oh, I mean, Thyer.
OK? I can't remember.

667
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:05,438
- First name?
- Charles Thyer! That's it.

668
00:48:05,527 --> 00:48:08,325
- Talk to him lately?
- No. He got somebody else to do the job.

669
00:48:08,407 --> 00:48:11,763
- Are you lying to me?
- I swear I'm not.

670
00:48:13,207 --> 00:48:15,198
All right.

671
00:48:15,287 --> 00:48:17,847
- Did I hurt ya? Huh?
- No.

672
00:48:17,927 --> 00:48:20,680
Are you sure? You got a nipple ring?

673
00:48:20,767 --> 00:48:22,758
- No.
- Oh, good.

674
00:48:23,247 --> 00:48:25,715
Where are you going?
You can't just leave me here.

675
00:48:25,807 --> 00:48:27,798
That's for calling me Grandpa.

676
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,796
Look at that. Search results.

677
00:48:33,047 --> 00:48:35,515
No match. No Charles Thyer.

678
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:40,076
I don't get it.
I don't think Cochran would lie to us.

679
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,886
I mean, that kid was scared to death.

680
00:48:42,967 --> 00:48:45,083
Half of it's mine. Half.

681
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:47,806
Which one do you want? This one?

682
00:48:51,127 --> 00:48:53,163
Attaboy!

683
00:48:54,247 --> 00:48:56,636
Well, I gotta tell ya,

684
00:49:01,127 --> 00:49:03,516
whoever we're looking for,

685
00:49:04,167 --> 00:49:06,556
he's gonna come for this.

686
00:49:07,007 --> 00:49:09,885
So we'd better hide it in a good place.

687
00:49:09,967 --> 00:49:13,403
How about the little locket?
The one the girls gave you. Come on.

688
00:49:13,487 --> 00:49:17,924
Hard to believe a little thing like this
can crush a billion-dollar industry, huh?

689
00:49:18,007 --> 00:49:20,316
Now it's safe.
You don't want nobody near it.

690
00:49:21,927 --> 00:49:23,326
No.

691
00:49:25,527 --> 00:49:27,324
No.

692
00:49:29,887 --> 00:49:31,957
No! OK, I get the point!

693
00:49:32,367 --> 00:49:35,359
Charles Thyer
doesn't exist on this planet!

694
00:49:37,247 --> 00:49:39,078
All right. Calm down. Cool it.

695
00:49:39,167 --> 00:49:43,479
Cool it. Retired people
don't get crotchety like this.

696
00:49:44,887 --> 00:49:47,924
We're just gonna
move onto something else.

697
00:49:48,007 --> 00:49:51,363
Kevin Wingate file. OK.
Can you accept that?

698
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:53,722
Stupid machine.

699
00:50:07,847 --> 00:50:09,326
Yes!

700
00:50:12,647 --> 00:50:15,798
Born Allentown, Pennsylvania.

701
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:21,120
Technical school. Employed
by Pittsburgh Steel Company.

702
00:50:21,207 --> 00:50:22,640
Vietnam?

703
00:50:24,487 --> 00:50:26,523
(phone rings)

704
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:28,563
- What?
- Hello, Detective?

705
00:50:28,647 --> 00:50:32,322
Hi. It's Catherine Coleman.
I didn't wake you, did I?

706
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:37,800
No, no. Hi, Catherine. No, not at all. I
was just... fighting with my computer.

707
00:50:37,887 --> 00:50:40,560
- How's Molly?
- Well, it's...

708
00:50:40,647 --> 00:50:42,638
She... she's doing OK.

709
00:50:42,727 --> 00:50:45,366
She seems a little different,
though, you know?

710
00:50:45,447 --> 00:50:49,679
I had this feeling that it worked.

711
00:50:49,767 --> 00:50:53,203
- Really?
- Yeah. I don't know, it's just little things.

712
00:50:53,287 --> 00:50:57,439
But I'm sort of
keyed into her moods, you know?

713
00:50:57,527 --> 00:50:59,836
I know that sounds kind of silly, but...

714
00:50:59,927 --> 00:51:03,761
No, not at all. I know exactly what
you're talking about. I mean, Jerry Lee...

715
00:51:03,847 --> 00:51:07,476
I can always tell when he's
happy or he's sad or he's pissed off at me.

716
00:51:07,567 --> 00:51:10,604
Yeah, they're kind of
like kids, aren't they?

717
00:51:12,167 --> 00:51:14,601
Yeah, kinda.

718
00:51:15,727 --> 00:51:20,039
I mean, you know, Jerry Lee's my partner,
but he's... he's more, you know?

719
00:51:20,127 --> 00:51:22,118
He's...

720
00:51:22,927 --> 00:51:24,599
special.

721
00:51:26,087 --> 00:51:28,123
I thought you were going on a road trip?

722
00:51:28,207 --> 00:51:30,198
Oh, yeah. We are.

723
00:51:31,167 --> 00:51:34,637
I just have to wrap up
this huge PI case I'm running right now.

724
00:51:34,727 --> 00:51:39,005
Wow. So you're... you're an actual
private eye, like in the movies?

725
00:51:39,087 --> 00:51:41,726
Well, I... I mean, kinda.

726
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:44,605
- I love those old movies.
- Yeah, me too.

727
00:51:44,967 --> 00:51:48,642
Have you seen The Thin Man? It's one
of my favourite private-eye movies.

728
00:51:48,727 --> 00:51:51,605
- And he had a dog.
- And he's very thin.

729
00:51:51,687 --> 00:51:54,520
Yeah! He was!

730
00:51:55,727 --> 00:51:58,560
Listen, um... Catherine.

731
00:51:58,647 --> 00:52:01,719
I was thinking that maybe you,
me and the dogs could...

732
00:52:01,807 --> 00:52:05,322
- (beep)
- Can you hold? I got another call.

733
00:52:05,407 --> 00:52:07,398
- Sure.
- Thank you.

734
00:52:08,287 --> 00:52:11,643
- Yeah? Dooley.
- Detective? It's Laura Fields.

735
00:52:11,727 --> 00:52:14,560
- Laura?
- This is really embarrassing...

736
00:52:14,927 --> 00:52:17,202
(grunts) OK!

737
00:52:17,287 --> 00:52:19,562
Well, that's all done.

738
00:52:19,647 --> 00:52:23,162
- Thank you very much, Detective.
- You're welcome.

739
00:52:23,767 --> 00:52:27,282
It's just a little leak, I think.
But you wanna have it fixed by tomorrow.

740
00:52:27,367 --> 00:52:30,484
You don't wanna drive around
without a spare.

741
00:52:30,567 --> 00:52:32,956
Um... It's probably not
the right time to ask,

742
00:52:33,047 --> 00:52:36,119
but have you had any luck
finding Kevin?

743
00:52:36,207 --> 00:52:38,243
Well, let me ask you something.

744
00:52:38,327 --> 00:52:41,364
How long did you know Kevin
before you decided to get married?

745
00:52:41,447 --> 00:52:44,439
- About a year.
- Did he ever talk about what he did?

746
00:52:44,887 --> 00:52:47,685
Uh... investments. Technology stocks.

747
00:52:48,487 --> 00:52:50,478
Some real estate.

748
00:52:50,647 --> 00:52:54,356
Well, Laura,
I don't wanna sound like a pessimist,

749
00:52:54,447 --> 00:52:58,360
but you're gonna have to consider
the possibility that you won't find him.

750
00:52:58,447 --> 00:53:02,486
- You think something's happened to him?
- No. Just the opposite.

751
00:53:03,487 --> 00:53:05,523
I'm not sure he wants to be found.

752
00:53:06,167 --> 00:53:10,524
Right. He was looking for a way out.

753
00:53:10,607 --> 00:53:13,838
Well, your fiancé wasn't
exactly who you thought he was.

754
00:53:17,967 --> 00:53:20,845
- Who's this?
- Well, according to the US government,

755
00:53:20,927 --> 00:53:23,760
- this is Kevin Wingate.
- What is this? Some kind of a joke?

756
00:53:23,847 --> 00:53:28,682
No, it's not a joke. The social security
number you gave me belongs to this man.

757
00:53:28,767 --> 00:53:31,679
- And he died in 1995.
- What?

758
00:53:32,527 --> 00:53:34,836
- It's not Kevin.
- Kevin... Whoever he is...

759
00:53:34,927 --> 00:53:37,043
- Why would he do this to me?
- I don't know.

760
00:53:37,127 --> 00:53:40,563
- Why would he lie to... me?
- I don't know. I have no idea.

761
00:53:43,287 --> 00:53:45,278
- Here, let me help you.
- No, I'm fine.

762
00:53:45,367 --> 00:53:48,006
I've managed this long
on my own. I'll be fine.

763
00:53:48,087 --> 00:53:50,078
I'm sorry. Thank you
for taking the case.

764
00:53:50,167 --> 00:53:53,239
If you'll just send me the bill,
I'll settle my account.

765
00:53:53,327 --> 00:53:56,763
- Look, you hired me to find your fiancé.
- But you just said...

766
00:53:56,847 --> 00:54:00,681
He's not who you thought.
That doesn't mean the case is closed.

767
00:54:01,887 --> 00:54:06,039
When you set your mind to something,
you don't give up, do you, Detective?

768
00:54:06,127 --> 00:54:08,516
Well, nobody's perfect.

769
00:54:10,007 --> 00:54:11,998
Come on.

770
00:54:16,247 --> 00:54:18,522
- Take care.
- I'll call you.

771
00:54:32,327 --> 00:54:35,637
OK, Jerry Lee.
This morning we got some lessons.

772
00:54:35,727 --> 00:54:40,517
Because... you know what? There aren't
many people in this world that I trust.

773
00:54:40,607 --> 00:54:42,598
But you are one of the people.

774
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:46,919
So, since we don't belong to
the police department any more,

775
00:54:47,007 --> 00:54:50,158
we can't just call Dispatch
for backup, right?

776
00:54:51,207 --> 00:54:55,917
So you and I, we're gonna have a little
training session after breakfast.

777
00:54:56,007 --> 00:54:59,044
And we're gonna learn
how to cover each other's backs.

778
00:54:59,127 --> 00:55:02,836
OK, Jerry Lee. Here's the cellphone.
Here are the pencils.

779
00:55:02,927 --> 00:55:05,487
Cellphone's down on the ground.
I got the pencils.

780
00:55:05,567 --> 00:55:08,559
I'm gonna throw 'em.
Stay right there. Stay right there.

781
00:55:08,647 --> 00:55:11,684
When you hear a bang, you go get 'em!

782
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:15,316
- (fires gun)
- Bang, bang! That's it! That's it!

783
00:55:16,727 --> 00:55:19,605
Attaboy! Bring it here,
bring it here! Attaboy!

784
00:55:19,687 --> 00:55:22,360
No, the phone. Pencil to the phone.

785
00:55:22,807 --> 00:55:25,116
Like that. Like that.

786
00:55:25,207 --> 00:55:28,040
Like this, see?
No, no, no, don't knock the phone over.

787
00:55:28,127 --> 00:55:31,836
- (fires gun)
- Bang! Go get it. Attaboy! Any pencil!

788
00:55:31,927 --> 00:55:34,282
Get the pencil! Bring it to the phone.

789
00:55:34,367 --> 00:55:37,245
The phone, the phone.
Pencil into the phone.

790
00:55:38,287 --> 00:55:41,085
You're getting it.
The phone, the phone, the phone.

791
00:55:41,167 --> 00:55:43,158
No, no, no, no. We're not playing.

792
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:49,243
You're not helping.
You're not working with me, boy.

793
00:55:49,887 --> 00:55:52,037
Jerry, no, no, no, it's not a bone.

794
00:55:52,127 --> 00:55:54,595
It's a phone. Yeah.

795
00:55:54,687 --> 00:55:56,837
Jerry! Jerry, give me that pencil.

796
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:59,157
That's it. That's it, see?

797
00:55:59,247 --> 00:56:01,283
Phone. Here.

798
00:56:01,367 --> 00:56:05,838
I have heard that certain individuals have
difficulty adjusting to life after retirement.

799
00:56:05,927 --> 00:56:08,964
- But this takes the cake.
- Hi, Petey.

800
00:56:09,047 --> 00:56:11,925
I'm trying to train Jerry Lee here
on how to use my cellphone.

801
00:56:12,007 --> 00:56:14,396
Oh, I don't think
he has figured that out yet.

802
00:56:14,487 --> 00:56:16,637
Look, it's still a work in progress.

803
00:56:16,727 --> 00:56:19,719
OK, buddy. Here. Go get it!
Go get that pencil!

804
00:56:20,487 --> 00:56:23,399
- I got your message. What's up?
- Hey, thanks for coming.

805
00:56:23,487 --> 00:56:26,126
- I think I know who torched the place.
- Are you serious?

806
00:56:26,207 --> 00:56:28,198
- Yeah.
- Don't tell me.

807
00:56:28,287 --> 00:56:30,278
If you tell me, I have to reopen the case.

808
00:56:30,367 --> 00:56:33,086
If I can find him, he can lead me
to the guy who did the heist.

809
00:56:33,167 --> 00:56:37,001
What is this? The Misery Loves Company
group? You want me off the job too?

810
00:56:37,087 --> 00:56:39,442
Come on, Petey.
This is your chance to be a hero!

811
00:56:39,527 --> 00:56:42,564
Save me the sales pitch.
All right. What do ya got?

812
00:56:42,647 --> 00:56:44,638
Thyer. A name. Thyer.

813
00:56:45,007 --> 00:56:46,998
- Charles Thyer.
- Thyer.

814
00:56:47,087 --> 00:56:51,000
Well, what makes you think he torched
the place before he robbed it?

815
00:56:51,087 --> 00:56:55,683
You told me that the Microlabs changed
insurance companies after the fire, right?

816
00:56:55,767 --> 00:56:59,965
Insurance companies need to approve
blueprints before they sign a new policy.

817
00:57:00,047 --> 00:57:02,322
So you think he took a look at the plans.

818
00:57:02,407 --> 00:57:05,763
With all that security, he knew his way
around pretty damn good.

819
00:57:05,847 --> 00:57:08,600
- All right, I'll check this guy out.
- Thanks, Petey.

820
00:57:08,687 --> 00:57:11,247
- But listen. This is the last time.
- What?

821
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:15,286
- You are not a cop any more.
- I'm not a cop. Can't even spell it.

822
00:57:15,527 --> 00:57:17,518
- Thanks.
- Good luck with the phone.

823
00:57:17,607 --> 00:57:20,917
You'll know if it works. I programmed
your number into the phone.

824
00:57:21,007 --> 00:57:23,726
You know, Dooley, sometimes
I wonder about you.

825
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:27,846
- Most of the time, I wonder about you.
- Me too, Petey. Me too.

826
00:57:28,607 --> 00:57:31,724
What? Not all the pencils! One pencil!

827
00:57:31,807 --> 00:57:34,241
Just one pencil. What are we gonna do?

828
00:57:34,327 --> 00:57:37,603
I have a better shot at
teaching you how to use a payphone.

829
00:57:59,207 --> 00:58:02,961
- So?
- Are you certain he was a cop?

830
00:58:03,727 --> 00:58:05,797
Oh, yeah. This guy was a cop.

831
00:58:05,927 --> 00:58:09,602
This guy had handcuffs, OK?
He had a police-issue.9mm.

832
00:58:09,687 --> 00:58:13,316
He had a big-ass German shepherd,
all right? Yeah, he was a cop.

833
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:16,046
And you said... nothing
that would lead him to me?

834
00:58:16,127 --> 00:58:20,200
Nothing at all, man. I mean,
I played this thing totally cool.

835
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:23,563
You know me. I'm a loyal guy, right?
Loyalty's everything to me.

836
00:58:23,647 --> 00:58:25,683
- Yeah.
- Right?

837
00:58:25,767 --> 00:58:28,201
- Relax, Billy. It's all right, man.
- OK.

838
00:58:28,287 --> 00:58:31,563
- Yeah?
- All right. I swear I didn't say a thing.

839
00:58:33,367 --> 00:58:35,927
- It's cool.
- OK.

840
00:58:36,007 --> 00:58:37,998
- Yeah?
- Cos, you know, if you're good...

841
00:58:38,087 --> 00:58:41,124
Hey. Don't worry about it, OK?

842
00:58:41,447 --> 00:58:43,722
- Get outta here.
- All right.

843
00:58:43,807 --> 00:58:45,877
- Yeah?
- OK.

844
00:58:45,967 --> 00:58:47,958
OK.

845
00:59:00,687 --> 00:59:02,917
Loyalty's everything to me too, Billy.

846
00:59:14,247 --> 00:59:16,238
Here we go, my friend.

847
00:59:17,607 --> 00:59:19,598
- Jerry Lee?
- (growling)

848
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:22,517
- What's the matter?
- (growling)

849
00:59:35,167 --> 00:59:37,158
Seek.

850
00:59:55,847 --> 00:59:58,202
OK, boy. Come on.

851
01:00:06,487 --> 01:00:08,955
Seek.

852
01:00:14,447 --> 01:00:17,166
What the hell happened here, Jerry?

853
01:00:19,567 --> 01:00:22,206
- Freeze!
- Oh, my God!

854
01:00:22,287 --> 01:00:25,359
- Out! Out!
- It's... it's me!

855
01:00:25,447 --> 01:00:28,519
- What are you doing here?
- Kevin was at my house.

856
01:00:28,607 --> 01:00:31,121
- Who?
- Kevin! Or whoever he is!

857
01:00:31,207 --> 01:00:35,359
Whatever his name is! He was there,
waiting for me after work.

858
01:00:35,447 --> 01:00:39,201
And he knows that I've been looking for
him. He knows all about you, too.

859
01:00:39,287 --> 01:00:42,757
I tried to confront him about all the lies,
but he just... He went...

860
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:45,566
The guy is out of his mind!
He started saying things to me.

861
01:00:45,647 --> 01:00:47,877
Really... really horrible things.

862
01:00:47,967 --> 01:00:50,959
And then he threatened...
He threatened to hurt me.

863
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:54,403
I didn't know what to do, so I got
in the car. I tried to call you, but...

864
01:00:54,487 --> 01:00:58,082
- OK.
- There was no answer, and I got scared.

865
01:00:58,167 --> 01:01:00,158
Just take it easy, OK?

866
01:01:00,247 --> 01:01:03,045
Take it easy. Come here, sit down.

867
01:01:03,127 --> 01:01:06,802
Sit down. There you go.
There you go. Just relax, OK?

868
01:01:06,887 --> 01:01:09,196
Here, let me get something for ya.

869
01:01:09,287 --> 01:01:12,006
Here. Here. Take this.

870
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:16,318
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

871
01:01:16,407 --> 01:01:18,398
- No, I'm sorry.
- No, it's OK.

872
01:01:18,487 --> 01:01:22,719
- Sorry. I keep doing this to your clothes.
- Oh, don't worry about the shirt.

873
01:01:22,807 --> 01:01:25,560
Listen, uh...
does he have a key to your place?

874
01:01:25,647 --> 01:01:29,720
- Yes, of course he does.
- Well, you can't go home.

875
01:01:29,807 --> 01:01:31,798
You should find a hotel.

876
01:01:31,887 --> 01:01:34,606
- I can't. I've got Lana.
- Who?

877
01:01:34,927 --> 01:01:37,202
My dog. I can't keep her
in the car all night.

878
01:01:38,567 --> 01:01:43,004
- Why don't you just stay here?
- I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

879
01:01:43,087 --> 01:01:45,601
Oh, this mess?
I can clean up in a few minutes.

880
01:01:45,687 --> 01:01:48,918
- What happened in here?
- I don't know.

881
01:01:49,007 --> 01:01:52,716
- I don't think I can impose.
- Don't worry. It's not an imposition.

882
01:01:52,807 --> 01:01:56,402
I'll just clean up all of it.
It'll take me a few minutes, that's all.

883
01:01:56,487 --> 01:02:00,605
Then I'll make up the couch here,
and you can sleep here,

884
01:02:00,687 --> 01:02:03,201
and in the morning
change the locks at your place.

885
01:02:03,287 --> 01:02:07,724
- You sure you don't mind?
- Oh, no, no. Not at all. It'll be a pleasure.

886
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:12,039
- (growling)
- I'm not sure he thinks it's a good idea.

887
01:02:12,127 --> 01:02:15,403
- He'll be fine.
- OK. I'll go get her.

888
01:02:15,487 --> 01:02:18,763
- Go. You don't want her sitting in the car.
- I'll be right back.

889
01:02:18,847 --> 01:02:19,836
OK.

890
01:02:25,327 --> 01:02:27,761
Come here.

891
01:02:27,847 --> 01:02:29,838
You see those legs?

892
01:02:30,807 --> 01:02:34,516
Listen to me. I don't care
what kind of rat dog she's got,

893
01:02:34,607 --> 01:02:37,883
I want you to be kind,
friendly, and share your toys.

894
01:02:37,967 --> 01:02:41,403
- Otherwise I'll lock you in the bathroom.
- We're back!

895
01:02:46,287 --> 01:02:48,721
Happy now? Come on in.

896
01:02:53,607 --> 01:02:56,075
Well, thanks for helping clean the place.

897
01:02:56,167 --> 01:02:58,158
Oh, it's the least I could do.

898
01:02:59,167 --> 01:03:01,362
Why someone would do
something like this...!

899
01:03:01,447 --> 01:03:03,278
Well, they were looking for something.

900
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:05,927
- Did they find it?
- It wasn't here.

901
01:03:07,127 --> 01:03:08,401
(whining)

902
01:03:08,487 --> 01:03:10,603
Well, well, well, well.

903
01:03:12,047 --> 01:03:15,801
Will you look at those two? I think
we should give 'em a little privacy.

904
01:03:15,887 --> 01:03:18,720
- You think?
- I don't know.

905
01:03:18,807 --> 01:03:20,798
Yeah.

906
01:03:26,927 --> 01:03:28,918
Be gentle.

907
01:03:31,967 --> 01:03:34,765
This is the bathroom. Kitchen, of course.

908
01:03:34,847 --> 01:03:39,125
This is my room.
The sheets are always clean in there.

909
01:03:39,447 --> 01:03:41,756
You know the living room.
The door is locked,

910
01:03:41,847 --> 01:03:44,805
so you should feel
very comfortable and safe, and...

911
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:48,766
You're all set here, so... breakfast
and coffee is served at eight.

912
01:03:48,847 --> 01:03:51,315
- OK. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

913
01:03:51,407 --> 01:03:56,242
I didn't plan on this, so I don't actually
have anything, you know, to sleep in.

914
01:03:57,247 --> 01:03:59,238
That's fine.

915
01:04:01,127 --> 01:04:04,642
- Can I borrow something?
- Oh, yeah. Sure. Um...

916
01:04:05,127 --> 01:04:07,402
A shirt. I'll get a shirt.

917
01:04:08,527 --> 01:04:12,839
I mean, Jerry Lee and I, we don't sleep
in pyjamas, so we don't have any.

918
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:19,878
It's pretty nice, huh?

919
01:04:20,447 --> 01:04:22,438
- Perfect.
- Yeah. This one's clean.

920
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:24,518
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

921
01:04:26,727 --> 01:04:31,562
You'd like to change, wouldn't you? Yes.
I'd like to step out while you do that.

922
01:04:50,287 --> 01:04:54,280
- Well. It looks great on you. Huh! It fits.
- Yeah.

923
01:04:54,367 --> 01:04:58,997
Is there anything else
I can get you before we... I mean, uh...

924
01:04:59,087 --> 01:05:01,999
- You hit the sack.
- A glass of water would be nice.

925
01:05:02,087 --> 01:05:06,319
Agua... mineral. Water on the way.

926
01:05:23,207 --> 01:05:25,880
- Thank you.
- Is that enough?

927
01:05:25,967 --> 01:05:27,559
Yeah.

928
01:05:31,487 --> 01:05:33,921
Well, Laura, is there anything else
I can get you?

929
01:05:34,007 --> 01:05:37,556
You know, a nightcap,
piece of fruit. Floss?

930
01:05:38,007 --> 01:05:41,556
Uh, you wouldn't happen
to have any raisins, would you?

931
01:05:41,647 --> 01:05:43,717
Yes. Yes, I have raisins. Hold on.

932
01:05:48,327 --> 01:05:50,318
Raisins.

933
01:05:56,647 --> 01:05:59,798
Yeah, I got raisins. I got raisins.

934
01:06:06,407 --> 01:06:08,398
Raisins are really good.

935
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:18,199
- Mm. Here you go.
- Mm. Great. Thank you, I love raisins.

936
01:06:18,287 --> 01:06:20,357
- I love raisins too.
- They're so good.

937
01:06:20,447 --> 01:06:22,915
- Well, they're actually grapes, you know.
- Mm-hm.

938
01:06:23,007 --> 01:06:25,077
Vineyards use grapes for wine,

939
01:06:25,727 --> 01:06:28,958
and the grapes that they don't use
they turn into raisins.

940
01:06:29,047 --> 01:06:31,117
So we're actually eating Merlot.

941
01:06:32,607 --> 01:06:35,758
Or we're eating... shitty grapes.

942
01:06:35,847 --> 01:06:39,203
- Or something. I don't know.
- Mm. They're very, uh...

943
01:06:41,167 --> 01:06:43,158
- Moist.
- Mm-hm.

944
01:06:49,647 --> 01:06:52,320
- And tender.
- And tender.

945
01:06:54,087 --> 01:06:56,123
And low in cholesterol.

946
01:07:09,767 --> 01:07:13,203
- Wait. I'm sorry.
- What?

947
01:07:13,287 --> 01:07:16,438
- I have to ask you something.
- I got something, in the bedroom.

948
01:07:16,527 --> 01:07:19,599
They're a little old, but
the expiration date says they're fine.

949
01:07:19,687 --> 01:07:24,044
No, no, no. Is this...
the beginning of something special,

950
01:07:24,127 --> 01:07:26,960
or is it just a one-night stand?

951
01:07:32,447 --> 01:07:36,326
I think maybe we're getting
ahead of ourselves here.

952
01:07:36,407 --> 01:07:40,082
- Moving along too fast.
- OK.

953
01:07:40,167 --> 01:07:42,806
Maybe we should talk about it
in the morning?

954
01:07:42,887 --> 01:07:45,355
- Yeah.
- OK.

955
01:07:55,687 --> 01:07:57,678
- Good night.
- Night.

956
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:02,118
- Dooley?
- Yes?

957
01:08:02,207 --> 01:08:05,085
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

958
01:08:05,607 --> 01:08:06,881
Son of a bitch.

959
01:08:17,807 --> 01:08:20,401
- Looking for something?
- Oh, you scared me to death!

960
01:08:20,487 --> 01:08:24,116
Yeah, I'm looking for a pen.
I wanted to leave you a note.

961
01:08:24,207 --> 01:08:27,438
There's one right there on the desk
behind you.

962
01:08:27,527 --> 01:08:30,678
- Duh!
- How about breakfast?

963
01:08:30,767 --> 01:08:35,795
- I make a mean breakfast.
- Oh, Dooley, I would love to, but I can't.

964
01:08:35,887 --> 01:08:39,562
I've got a crazy day at work,
and I still have to walk Lana.

965
01:08:39,647 --> 01:08:43,481
I can do that. I'm gonna walk Jerry Lee
anyway. I'm taking him to the dog park.

966
01:08:43,567 --> 01:08:48,197
- One of the benefits of retirement.
- It's not a good idea. She's really finicky.

967
01:08:50,527 --> 01:08:53,564
Is this about last night?

968
01:08:53,647 --> 01:08:55,638
Don't worry about last night.

969
01:08:59,527 --> 01:09:01,518
Bye-bye.

970
01:09:03,527 --> 01:09:05,757
All right. I'll call you soon.

971
01:09:11,967 --> 01:09:15,721
Stop your bull.
You know, I made a choice.

972
01:09:15,807 --> 01:09:17,877
You're a dog.

973
01:09:20,007 --> 01:09:22,237
Hey! Hey!

974
01:09:22,327 --> 01:09:27,447
Who jacked my place? You were meant
to be watching! Who jacked my house?

975
01:09:27,527 --> 01:09:29,643
- What's going on?
- You were watching it!

976
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:32,082
I can't stand this any more.
I've had it up to here.

977
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:36,080
- This is an invasion of privacy!
- The captain wants to see you.

978
01:09:36,167 --> 01:09:39,398
- As soon as I'm done with these feds.
- They can wait.

979
01:09:39,487 --> 01:09:42,479
- The captain wants you in his office, now.
- Now?

980
01:09:43,527 --> 01:09:45,085
(Jerry Lee barks)

981
01:09:45,167 --> 01:09:48,796
- What's wrong? I do something wrong?
- Get in the car.

982
01:09:48,887 --> 01:09:51,685
Come on, Jerry Lee.
We're going downtown.

983
01:10:00,007 --> 01:10:01,998
Breathe.

984
01:10:06,727 --> 01:10:10,640
- What's so important I need an escort?
- Sit down, Dooley, and shut up.

985
01:10:12,367 --> 01:10:16,121
We found a body in the reservoir
this morning. Billy Cochran.

986
01:10:16,207 --> 01:10:20,837
Is there anything you want to tell us about
your relationship to the deceased?

987
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:23,839
- What, am I a suspect again?
- You tell me.

988
01:10:23,927 --> 01:10:28,239
Somebody with your description and
Jerry Lee's has a gunfight with him in his
loft.

989
01:10:28,327 --> 01:10:31,876
And I know you were in my office
looking him up on my computer.

990
01:10:31,967 --> 01:10:36,643
- Captain, I did not kill Billy Cochran.
- Then what the hell are you up to?

991
01:10:36,727 --> 01:10:39,116
This came from the DOJ this morning.

992
01:10:39,207 --> 01:10:42,040
It's the guy you asked about -
Charles Thyer.

993
01:10:42,127 --> 01:10:46,757
This is Nicolas Burrows.
And this is Kevin Wingate.

994
01:10:46,847 --> 01:10:50,203
(Thomas) Burrows and Wingate
are aliases for Charles Thyer.

995
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:54,883
According to the feds, he's an industrial
terrorist with a penchant for disguise.

996
01:10:54,967 --> 01:10:58,482
They think he's the one
who jacked the lab.

997
01:10:58,567 --> 01:11:01,764
There were four microchips stolen.
They were prototypes.

998
01:11:01,847 --> 01:11:05,999
But one is an alpha chip. Without it,
the other microchips will not work.

999
01:11:06,087 --> 01:11:09,477
I know that. Where's Thyer?

1000
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:13,401
Uh, nobody knows. They almost got him
twice, but both times he got away.

1001
01:11:13,487 --> 01:11:17,400
- He might have someone on the inside.
- Well, Cochran gave up Thyer.

1002
01:11:18,087 --> 01:11:20,442
Cochrars dead,
my house has been ransacked...

1003
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:23,166
- You think Thyer's behind all this?
- I'm sure of it.

1004
01:11:23,247 --> 01:11:25,966
Is there anybody else
who can corroborate this hunch?

1005
01:11:26,527 --> 01:11:29,121
Maybe. Frankie the Fence.

1006
01:11:29,207 --> 01:11:32,119
- All right. Find Frankie. Bring him in.
- You can't do that.

1007
01:11:32,207 --> 01:11:35,244
He finds out, Thyer'll be gone.
We'll never be able to get him.

1008
01:11:35,327 --> 01:11:37,602
You're not a cop any more, Dooley.
Let it go.

1009
01:11:37,687 --> 01:11:40,918
You have to understand,
Jerry Lee and I have been working on
him.

1010
01:11:41,007 --> 01:11:44,522
We know what he's looking for. We can
find him, but we need Frankie to do it.

1011
01:11:44,607 --> 01:11:46,882
- What am I supposed to do?
- Leave Frankie the Fence alone.

1012
01:11:46,967 --> 01:11:49,117
Gimme 24 hours. You'll get your killer,

1013
01:11:49,207 --> 01:11:51,675
the feds'll get their thief
and I'll get my pension.

1014
01:11:51,767 --> 01:11:54,327
And you'll never see me again.

1015
01:11:54,407 --> 01:11:58,002
- 24 hours, that's all.
- Not one minute more, Dooley.

1016
01:11:58,087 --> 01:11:59,805
Yes, sir.

1017
01:12:09,887 --> 01:12:12,276
Ah, if it isn't the
former Detective Dooley.

1018
01:12:13,047 --> 01:12:17,199
- Well, hello, Frankie. How's the fagioli?
- Gives me indigestion, just like you.

1019
01:12:17,807 --> 01:12:20,685
You hurt my feelings.
So you're not gonna ask me to join you?

1020
01:12:20,767 --> 01:12:22,837
You wanna talk, you get a warrant.

1021
01:12:23,527 --> 01:12:26,599
Oh, I forgot, you can't.
You're not a cop any more.

1022
01:12:26,687 --> 01:12:28,962
Well, in that case, get lost.

1023
01:12:40,927 --> 01:12:42,918
OK. I'll go.

1024
01:12:43,327 --> 01:12:46,080
Sorry to bother you.
I know you're eating. Enjoy your meal.

1025
01:12:46,167 --> 01:12:48,158
- Wait, Dooley.
- What?

1026
01:12:48,687 --> 01:12:52,475
- Tell him to let go of me.
- You want me to join you?

1027
01:12:52,567 --> 01:12:56,879
Why, thank you very much, Frankie.
I don't mind if I do. The beans look good.

1028
01:12:57,407 --> 01:12:59,841
I understand you're moving
some hot property.

1029
01:12:59,927 --> 01:13:03,715
- I don't know what you're talking... Oh!
- (Jerry Lee growls)

1030
01:13:04,487 --> 01:13:08,446
- Business has been good.
- Well, I'm glad to hear that, Frankie.

1031
01:13:08,527 --> 01:13:11,405
- Because I'm looking for a vendor.
- You're a cop.

1032
01:13:11,487 --> 01:13:15,196
Not any more. They took my pension
away. This is for my personal growth.

1033
01:13:15,287 --> 01:13:18,279
No way. I got a strict policy...

1034
01:13:18,367 --> 01:13:20,358
- Ow!
- (Jerry Lee growls)

1035
01:13:23,327 --> 01:13:27,320
All right. In your case,
I'm willing to make an exception.

1036
01:13:27,407 --> 01:13:30,524
- Well, thank you, Frankie.
- What are you selling?

1037
01:13:31,047 --> 01:13:34,164
A microchip. You heard of it?

1038
01:13:34,247 --> 01:13:36,238
- Mm.
- Jerry Lee.

1039
01:13:42,727 --> 01:13:48,359
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Wouldn’t be a prototype, would it?

1040
01:13:49,407 --> 01:13:52,205
Tell your buyer to bring the other three,
see if they match.

1041
01:13:52,287 --> 01:13:54,642
- What's your price?
- Two million.

1042
01:13:54,727 --> 01:13:57,844
- Hah! No... That... that's reasonable.
- (Jerry Lee growls)

1043
01:13:58,287 --> 01:14:00,926
Well, I want him there in person
with the money.

1044
01:14:01,327 --> 01:14:04,080
Midnight tonight at the foundry? All right?

1045
01:14:04,167 --> 01:14:06,044
Good.

1046
01:14:06,127 --> 01:14:09,881
- Come on, Jerry.
- Uh... No dog.

1047
01:14:09,967 --> 01:14:12,117
- No dog, no deal.
- Aw...

1048
01:14:12,207 --> 01:14:16,120
My client's coming alone.
So can you. Come on! Fair's fair.

1049
01:14:16,967 --> 01:14:22,200
All right, the dog will stay in the car. But
I want him there, in person, with the cash.

1050
01:14:22,287 --> 01:14:25,677
- All right.
- Keep the bread. I'm on that protein thing.

1051
01:14:25,767 --> 01:14:28,156
- Right.
- Come on, Jerry.

1052
01:14:32,847 --> 01:14:36,840
Hi. You've reached Kevin and Laura.
Please leave us a message.

1053
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:41,557
Laura, I've been trying to reach you.
Please call me as soon as you get this.

1054
01:14:45,567 --> 01:14:48,081
OK, buddy. Here we are.

1055
01:14:49,807 --> 01:14:53,004
OK. Gimme that little... chip.

1056
01:14:55,687 --> 01:14:58,247
OK. Here's the deal.

1057
01:14:59,367 --> 01:15:02,518
Here's the phone. Phone there.

1058
01:15:02,607 --> 01:15:04,802
Pen. It's right here.

1059
01:15:04,887 --> 01:15:10,166
You hear anything, anything at all,
you call Petey with the pen.

1060
01:15:10,247 --> 01:15:12,442
Bang! That's it.

1061
01:15:12,527 --> 01:15:14,722
Bang! Good. OK.

1062
01:15:18,727 --> 01:15:21,002
OK, buddy, I'll be back.

1063
01:15:24,247 --> 01:15:26,886
Use the phone to call Petey
if you need to.

1064
01:16:00,447 --> 01:16:02,165
That's far enough.

1065
01:16:06,967 --> 01:16:10,164
Well, if it isn't Charles Thyer.

1066
01:16:10,247 --> 01:16:13,045
- Or should I say Kevin Wingate?
- Does it matter?

1067
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:18,123
To some people. The IRS? Your fiancee?

1068
01:16:18,687 --> 01:16:22,999
- Blockbuster Video?
- Detective... put down your gun.

1069
01:16:32,807 --> 01:16:34,957
- You got the money?
- No.

1070
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:38,640
- Give it to me.
- No.

1071
01:16:46,927 --> 01:16:49,316
The next one won't miss.

1072
01:16:51,487 --> 01:16:53,603
- Take it easy, Chucky.
- Hey!

1073
01:16:54,047 --> 01:16:56,515
- Do not call me Chucky.
- I can understand that.

1074
01:16:56,607 --> 01:16:58,723
You must have gotten trouble as a kid.

1075
01:16:58,807 --> 01:17:03,403
You know, the little doll with the knife?
Chucky, Chucky, Chucky!

1076
01:17:03,487 --> 01:17:06,285
- Easy.
- Back up. Back up.

1077
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:11,926
OK.

1078
01:17:13,127 --> 01:17:15,118
Do you know
what you put me through?

1079
01:17:15,207 --> 01:17:18,722
I didn't do it on purpose.
I didn't know Jerry Lee swallowed it.

1080
01:17:19,727 --> 01:17:22,400
You don't wanna
blow that thing off, Charles.

1081
01:17:22,487 --> 01:17:26,480
I mean, another bang!
And you don't know who's gonna hear
that.

1082
01:17:26,927 --> 01:17:30,522
You just keep popping
those things out - bang! Bang! Bang!

1083
01:17:30,607 --> 01:17:33,041
You need to shut up. Right now.

1084
01:17:33,127 --> 01:17:35,357
(whines)

1085
01:17:35,967 --> 01:17:39,926
You got the chip.
What else do you want?

1086
01:17:40,487 --> 01:17:43,206
From you? Absolutely nothing.

1087
01:17:44,807 --> 01:17:46,798
(gunshot)

1088
01:18:04,247 --> 01:18:06,636
He was gonna kill you.

1089
01:18:07,487 --> 01:18:09,876
- I had to stop him.
- Yeah.

1090
01:18:13,167 --> 01:18:15,158
Thank you.

1091
01:18:20,447 --> 01:18:23,086
You said you'd find him, and you did.

1092
01:18:29,527 --> 01:18:30,516
Uh-uh!

1093
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:33,158
Laura...

1094
01:18:36,087 --> 01:18:38,078
You are good!

1095
01:18:38,727 --> 01:18:40,718
Really good.

1096
01:18:41,847 --> 01:18:46,079
You know, I always wondered how
Thyer knew his way around that lab.

1097
01:18:46,447 --> 01:18:51,282
And when I finally figured out that Charles
Thyer and Kevin Wingate, your fiancé,

1098
01:18:51,367 --> 01:18:55,155
were the same guy, all I had to do was
take one look at your business card.

1099
01:18:55,567 --> 01:18:58,400
And bang! I had my answer.

1100
01:19:03,967 --> 01:19:07,801
Insurance adjuster.
Fire, blueprints... Bingo.

1101
01:19:08,727 --> 01:19:10,877
You were in on it with him, huh?

1102
01:19:11,647 --> 01:19:16,118
What... what happened? Why did you lose
interest? What went wrong? What?

1103
01:19:16,207 --> 01:19:19,119
You decided to split up
after he lost the chip?

1104
01:19:19,207 --> 01:19:22,643
He always told me partners
only get one mistake. That was his.

1105
01:19:22,727 --> 01:19:24,797
- Oh.
- You're pretty smart, Dooley.

1106
01:19:24,887 --> 01:19:26,878
I guess that's your mistake.

1107
01:19:31,287 --> 01:19:36,236
You set me up. You put me onto Wingate
to find Thyer for you.

1108
01:19:36,327 --> 01:19:40,115
I hired you to find my fiancé.
You did your job.

1109
01:19:40,207 --> 01:19:42,767
Thanks. Can I use you as a reference?

1110
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:44,838
(phone rings)

1111
01:19:47,087 --> 01:19:50,523
- LAPD, Detectives. Hello?
- (barking)

1112
01:19:51,247 --> 01:19:54,284
Must be a prank. Some dog on the phone.

1113
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:59,839
A dog? Dooley trained Jerry Lee to dial
me on the cellphone if he got into trouble.

1114
01:20:02,167 --> 01:20:04,601
Give me the chip, Dooley.

1115
01:20:05,247 --> 01:20:07,886
You want it? Go get it.

1116
01:20:12,527 --> 01:20:14,643
You had to be a boy scout.

1117
01:20:23,167 --> 01:20:24,998
Get my gun.

1118
01:20:28,207 --> 01:20:31,244
Attaboy. Good boy!
Come on! Where were you? Damn it!

1119
01:20:36,007 --> 01:20:38,726
Laura? Laura, come on!

1120
01:20:41,567 --> 01:20:43,364
Jesus! Jerry!

1121
01:20:45,247 --> 01:20:47,238
Laura, you don't have to do this!

1122
01:20:48,247 --> 01:20:50,238
Jerry Lee!

1123
01:20:52,967 --> 01:20:54,923
Easy! Easy!

1124
01:21:04,607 --> 01:21:06,598
Watch it. Watch it.

1125
01:21:11,287 --> 01:21:13,517
Jerry... you go that way.

1126
01:21:14,367 --> 01:21:16,358
Go on.

1127
01:21:19,847 --> 01:21:21,838
Good boy.

1128
01:22:11,487 --> 01:22:14,763
Come on, Laura.
You don't have to do this.

1129
01:22:15,207 --> 01:22:18,756
You can turn yourself in
and we'll work on a deal.

1130
01:22:18,847 --> 01:22:20,724
A deal! No deal.

1131
01:22:23,247 --> 01:22:25,124
It's all over, Dooley.

1132
01:22:25,207 --> 01:22:26,481
(gun clicks)

1133
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:28,478
Shit!

1134
01:22:32,287 --> 01:22:34,118
Why do I always pick the psychos?

1135
01:22:37,207 --> 01:22:39,482
Where are you going?

1136
01:22:39,567 --> 01:22:43,162
The police are coming.
You're trapped, you got nowhere to hide.

1137
01:22:43,247 --> 01:22:45,761
Please, be reasonable here.

1138
01:22:45,847 --> 01:22:48,884
- Screw you, Dooley.
- Nice mouth.

1139
01:22:52,247 --> 01:22:54,715
Hold on! Gimme... Here!

1140
01:22:56,487 --> 01:22:58,637
Hold on. Hold on. That's it. I got you.

1141
01:23:00,087 --> 01:23:02,157
Easy. Easy. Hold on!

1142
01:23:08,807 --> 01:23:10,559
I got you. Hang on.

1143
01:23:14,927 --> 01:23:17,361
Oh, Jesus.

1144
01:23:18,447 --> 01:23:20,915
Jerry Lee! Jerry Lee!

1145
01:23:26,767 --> 01:23:29,201
- Hold it!
- Don't you dare let go!

1146
01:23:30,527 --> 01:23:32,324
Jerry Lee!

1147
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:33,522
Jerry?

1148
01:23:34,687 --> 01:23:35,756
Come on!

1149
01:23:35,847 --> 01:23:37,121
Hang on.

1150
01:23:37,407 --> 01:23:38,635
Grab my pants!

1151
01:23:39,087 --> 01:23:41,362
That's it. My foot. Attaboy!

1152
01:23:42,247 --> 01:23:43,999
That's it. Pull!

1153
01:23:44,567 --> 01:23:46,797
That's it, boy. A little more!

1154
01:23:47,367 --> 01:23:49,961
That's it. Pull, Jerry Lee!

1155
01:23:52,647 --> 01:23:54,877
That's it.

1156
01:23:55,647 --> 01:23:57,126
Come on!

1157
01:23:57,207 --> 01:23:59,118
Dooley!

1158
01:23:59,727 --> 01:24:01,206
- Come on.
- Dooley!

1159
01:24:01,287 --> 01:24:03,278
- Here!
- (Jerry Lee barks)

1160
01:24:04,327 --> 01:24:06,716
I'm all right. Don't worry about it.

1161
01:24:10,167 --> 01:24:14,683
- Who the hell is she?
- This is Charles Thyer's partner.

1162
01:24:14,767 --> 01:24:18,806
- Arrest her.
- Guess I just picked the wrong guy.

1163
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:21,720
- That was your mistake, huh?
- No.

1164
01:24:21,807 --> 01:24:24,446
My mistake was going soft on you.

1165
01:24:26,287 --> 01:24:28,596
It happens.

1166
01:24:43,847 --> 01:24:47,237
Good work, Dooley.
Your pensions in my office.

1167
01:24:48,967 --> 01:24:51,435
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

1168
01:24:53,527 --> 01:24:55,916
So, Dooley. You're retired?

1169
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:57,486
Yeah.

1170
01:25:00,527 --> 01:25:02,677
- Hell, that dog did it again.
- Hey.

1171
01:25:04,447 --> 01:25:07,359
Jerry Lee... did you hear that?

1172
01:25:07,967 --> 01:25:10,800
The pension cheque is waiting.
We got our money. We're retired.

1173
01:25:10,887 --> 01:25:14,436
We're going on a trip, buddy! A big trip!

1174
01:25:14,527 --> 01:25:17,325
Gimme five! Gimme five, yeah!

1175
01:25:18,407 --> 01:25:21,479
And where were you?
Chasing squirrels while I almost died?

1176
01:25:21,567 --> 01:25:25,162
Leave me hanging over here?
It wasn't challenging enough for ya?

1177
01:25:25,247 --> 01:25:29,638
You have to wait till I'm actually almost
dead before you come and save the day?

1178
01:25:29,727 --> 01:25:32,924
You need more discipline as a dog.
And you know what I need?

1179
01:25:33,007 --> 01:25:35,680
I need a pizza. I am so hungry.

1180
01:25:39,487 --> 01:25:42,285
- Hey. Hey, Maurice.
- Well!

1181
01:25:42,807 --> 01:25:45,321
So there you are, finally.

1182
01:25:45,407 --> 01:25:47,398
Come on.

1183
01:25:48,247 --> 01:25:51,842
- How are you, Mr Studly?
- I'm just fine, thank you.

1184
01:25:51,927 --> 01:25:54,122
- OK, where are they?
- Keep your knickers on.

1185
01:25:54,207 --> 01:25:58,962
They're right over there. OK. Here we go.

1186
01:25:59,047 --> 01:26:02,881
- So, I heard you went on a little trip?
- Yeah. We went across country.

1187
01:26:02,967 --> 01:26:05,879
Right there and... the balance of payment.

1188
01:26:05,967 --> 01:26:09,118
- Oh, great.
- Mm-hm. Now skip along. She's waiting.

1189
01:26:09,207 --> 01:26:12,165
- Thank you, Maurice.
- You're welcome.

1190
01:26:12,247 --> 01:26:14,556
My God.

1191
01:26:14,647 --> 01:26:17,081
Jerry Lee, you're a dad.

1192
01:26:18,447 --> 01:26:20,438
Come on.

1193
01:26:22,367 --> 01:26:24,722
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

1194
01:26:24,807 --> 01:26:28,277
- I'm good. How are you?
- I'm... I'm great.

1195
01:26:28,367 --> 01:26:32,280
I promised you the pick of the litter.
So which one do you want?

1196
01:26:33,167 --> 01:26:36,796
- Can I have 'em all?
- No. I promised two to my sisters' kids.

1197
01:26:37,487 --> 01:26:39,478
Oh, my God. How do you pick?

1198
01:26:39,567 --> 01:26:43,116
Look how beautiful they are.
Jerry Lee, you are a stud.

1199
01:26:43,207 --> 01:26:47,962
Come on over here!
Well, look at... There's one! Oh, my God!

1200
01:26:48,047 --> 01:26:50,436
- Look at you!
- (farting)

1201
01:26:50,527 --> 01:26:53,758
Oh! Oh!

1202
01:26:53,847 --> 01:26:55,838
We'll take this one.

1203
01:26:55,927 --> 01:27:00,125
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, Jerry Lee, look at this one!

1204
01:27:00,207 --> 01:27:03,722
Look at this one. Yeah,
you can smell your own, can ya?

1205
01:27:05,207 --> 01:27:07,198
He's so beautiful.

1206
01:27:08,647 --> 01:27:10,638
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1207
01:27:12,207 --> 01:27:15,404
It's the puppy thing. I don't know.

1208
01:27:15,487 --> 01:27:18,559
So, what do we name him?

1209
01:27:21,127 --> 01:27:23,402
I don't know. Um...

1210
01:27:23,487 --> 01:27:26,479
- How about, uh... Nick?
- Nick's good.

1211
01:27:26,567 --> 01:27:27,556
- Nick.
- I like Nick.

1212
01:27:27,647 --> 01:27:31,686
- Or, you know, something like Mike, or...
- Mike, Nick, Peter.

1213
01:27:31,767 --> 01:27:33,758
- Paul.
- Peter. Paul. Mary!

1214
01:27:34,647 --> 01:27:38,356
- We clearly can't get a name out of this.
- We're pretty good at breeding...

1215
01:27:38,447 --> 01:27:41,325
How about we go into business?
You know, breeding dogs?

1216
01:27:41,407 --> 01:27:45,116
- I don't know. Um, it depends on the split.
- Well, 50-50 split.

1217
01:27:45,207 --> 01:27:48,916
- No, I don't think so, no. Wait a second.
- What do you mean, wait a second?

1218
01:27:49,007 --> 01:27:51,202
- Is this a negotiation ploy?
- Maybe.

1219
01:27:51,287 --> 01:27:52,640
- You got him?
- Yes, I got him.

1220
01:27:52,727 --> 01:27:55,958
- You're about to lose another one!
- Dooley, will you relax?

1221
01:27:56,047 --> 01:27:58,880
So, wait.
This negotiation thing's really important.

1222
01:27:58,967 --> 01:28:02,960
I don't wanna do... Oh, oh, oh, there goes
another one! Jerry Lee, go get him!

1223
01:28:03,047 --> 01:28:05,845
- I think he's after that terrier.
- Look how cute...
