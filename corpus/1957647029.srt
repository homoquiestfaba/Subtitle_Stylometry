What up? It's Tiffany Fluffit,
Channel 6 Action News.

285
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,262
The Bad Guys
have struck again...

286
00:11:16,395 --> 00:11:19,365
Guys, guys, stop it.
We're on TV.

287
00:11:19,498 --> 00:11:20,933
- Ooh, ooh!
- ...proving once more that they

288
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:23,502
are the most diabolical
criminals of our time.

289
00:11:23,636 --> 00:11:26,472
Ooh, "diabolical." That's new.

290
00:11:26,605 --> 00:11:28,140
Know what it sounds like?
A cologne.

291
00:11:28,274 --> 00:11:29,508
(dramatically):
Diabolical.

292
00:11:29,642 --> 00:11:31,410
TIFFANY: To address
this heinous crime spree

293
00:11:31,543 --> 00:11:34,513
is the newly elected governor,
Diane Foxington.

294
00:11:34,647 --> 00:11:35,915
- Governor?
- DIANE: Okay. Yeah.

295
00:11:36,048 --> 00:11:37,817
- I hear you. I hear you.
- (reporters clamoring)

296
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,520
Listen, listen. We all know
how dastardly the Bad Guys are.

297
00:11:41,654 --> 00:11:44,590
- WOLF: You bet we are.
- But more than anything...

298
00:11:44,724 --> 00:11:47,193
(chuckles)
I feel sorry for them.

299
00:11:47,326 --> 00:11:48,961
What?

300
00:11:49,095 --> 00:11:50,697
These so-called Bad Guys

301
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,465
are really just
second-rate has-beens.

302
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:55,501
Behind their amateurish antics

303
00:11:55,634 --> 00:11:57,770
and, frankly,
unoriginal capers...

304
00:11:57,904 --> 00:11:59,706
I mean, really, another bank?...

305
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,141
is nothing but
a deep well of anger...

306
00:12:02,274 --> 00:12:03,542
I ain't angry! You're angry!

307
00:12:03,676 --> 00:12:05,311
- ...denial...
- Not true.

308
00:12:05,444 --> 00:12:06,578
...and self-loathing.

309
00:12:06,713 --> 00:12:08,715
The only one I self-loathe
is you.

310
00:12:08,848 --> 00:12:11,183
And those are holes
that no amount of cash

311
00:12:11,317 --> 00:12:14,420
or priceless art can ever fill.

312
00:12:16,422 --> 00:12:18,490
What's on the Food Network?

313
00:12:18,624 --> 00:12:20,159
DIANE:
So, can we just forget about...

314
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:21,761
Who-who is she to judge us?

315
00:12:21,894 --> 00:12:23,730
- DIANE: ...and focus on more positive things?
- (growls)

316
00:12:23,863 --> 00:12:25,397
And what could be more positive

317
00:12:25,531 --> 00:12:27,533
than the Annual
Good Samaritan Awards,

318
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,636
where tomorrow night I will
present the Golden Dolphin

319
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:34,106
to this year's goodest citizen?

320
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,474
I can't believe I voted for her.

321
00:12:35,607 --> 00:12:36,876
You voted for her?

322
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:39,545
TARANTULA: What?
She's good on climate change.

323
00:12:39,678 --> 00:12:41,313
Wait. What's going on?

324
00:12:41,447 --> 00:12:43,950
You've got that twinkle
in your eye.

00:12:45,785 --> 00:12:48,955
Guys, who's up for another job?

326
00:12:49,088 --> 00:12:50,356
A big one.

327
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:51,958
(all gasp)

328
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,593
SNAKE:
The Golden Dolphin.

329
00:12:54,727 --> 00:12:56,228
- Seriously?
- Oh.

330
00:12:56,362 --> 00:12:57,864
I thought I was the crazy one.

331
00:12:57,997 --> 00:13:00,366
That job has broken
every criminal who's tried it.

332
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:03,035
The Bucharest Bandits,
Lucky Jim.

333
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:04,837
SHARK:
The Crimson Paw.

334
00:13:04,971 --> 00:13:06,672
Actually, the Crimson Paw
was never arrested.

335
00:13:06,806 --> 00:13:09,141
Yeah, but he never stole
anything again.

336
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:10,877
Snake, what better way

337
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,379
to wipe that smirk
off the governor's fuzzy face

338
00:13:13,512 --> 00:13:14,814
than stealing the Golden Dolphin

339
00:13:14,947 --> 00:13:16,816
from right under her whiskers?

340
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:19,551
This is the Holy Grail
of thievery.

341
00:13:19,685 --> 00:13:21,754
If we pull this off,
we'll cement our legacy

342
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:24,156
as the greatest criminals
of all time.

343
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,792
Whoa, whoa, buddy.

344
00:13:25,925 --> 00:13:28,427
I thought we weren't supposed
to make things personal.

345
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,462
Besides, we've got
a good thing going here.

346
00:13:30,596 --> 00:13:34,533
Friends, freedom,
and just look at this loot.

347
00:13:35,334 --> 00:13:36,635
All right, you're right.
Forget it.

348
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:38,938
- The Dolphin job is off.
- Good.

349
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:41,373
I guess the pig
will get his trophy after all.

350
00:13:41,507 --> 00:13:43,675
Yeah, I guess he would...

351

00:22:08,046 --> 00:22:10,649
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

528
00:22:10,782 --> 00:22:12,951
Thank you.

529
00:22:13,084 --> 00:22:15,987
Last year,
we faced our biggest test

530
00:22:16,121 --> 00:22:19,591
when a meteorite crashed
into our dear city.

531
00:22:19,725 --> 00:22:22,694
That meteorite didn't just make
a hole in our city.

532
00:22:22,828 --> 00:22:24,696
It made a hole in our hearts.

533
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,632
- CROWD: Aw.
- (Shark sniffles)

534
00:22:26,765 --> 00:22:29,034
But even in tragedy,
Professor Marmalade,

535
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:30,869
he did what he does so well.

536
00:22:31,002 --> 00:22:33,372
He made us look
at things differently.

537
00:22:33,505 --> 00:22:35,206
And thanks to you, Marmalade,

538
00:22:35,341 --> 00:22:38,944
the Love Crater Meteorite
will forever serve as a symbol

539
00:22:39,077 --> 00:22:42,714
of how there is good
even in the worst places.

540
00:22:42,848 --> 00:22:44,316
(applause)

541
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,717
Whoo!

542
00:22:45,851 --> 00:22:47,586
(Diane continues indistinctly)

543
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:49,154
(Piranha laughs, grunts)

544
00:22:52,023 --> 00:22:54,326
(all grunt)

545
00:22:55,126 --> 00:22:57,195
(groans) Hurry up.

546
00:22:57,996 --> 00:22:59,264
(grunts)

547
00:22:59,398 --> 00:23:00,999
...and successfully reversed
climate change

548
00:23:01,132 --> 00:23:03,402
for the well-being of all of us.

549
00:23:03,535 --> 00:23:07,138
This is going
surprisingly smoothly.

550
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,741
(gasps)

551
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,079
(Wolf yelps)

552
00:23:14,913 --> 00:23:17,115
What the molt is that?

553
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,650
WOLF: The Wolf Piranha
Snake Shark Tarantula

554
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,652
- Protection System.
- TARANTULA: The WPSST?

555
00:23:20,786 --> 00:23:23,154
- This was not supposed to happen.
- What?

556
00:23:23,288 --> 00:23:25,190
Guys, calm down. I'm on it.

557
00:23:25,323 --> 00:23:28,694
Initiating WPSST override
protocol. (chuckles)

558
00:23:28,827 --> 00:23:29,995
Get it, queen!

559
00:23:30,128 --> 00:23:31,497
(computer buzzes)

560
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,765
- WOLF: Did it work?
- Just give me five minutes.

561
00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:37,235
And now, please join me
in welcoming to the stage...

562
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:39,004
We don't have five minutes.

563
00:23:39,137 --> 00:23:41,239
...Professor Marmalade.

564
00:23:41,373 --> 00:23:42,307
Aw.

565
00:23:42,441 --> 00:23:44,676
We love you,
Professor Marmalade!

566
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,011
The pig is on the move.

567
00:23:46,144 --> 00:23:48,279
I repeat, the pig
is on the move.

568
00:23:48,414 --> 00:23:50,782
Webs, Webs, the curtain's
going up any minute.

569
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:51,983
It's not letting me in.

570
00:23:52,117 --> 00:23:53,284
Check your system preferences.

571
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:54,720
You probably need
to download a driver.

572
00:23:54,853 --> 00:23:55,821
Try rebooting.

573
00:23:55,954 --> 00:23:57,322
Oh, my gosh, you fixed it.

574
00:23:57,456 --> 00:23:58,557
- SNAKE and WOLF: Really?
- No!

575
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,459
- (door rattling)
- CHIEF: Hey, Larry.

576
00:24:00,592 --> 00:24:01,560
Come on, open up.

577
00:24:01,693 --> 00:24:03,361
What did we say
about locking doors?

578
00:24:03,495 --> 00:24:05,831
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Shark, I got a situation here.

579
00:24:05,964 --> 00:24:07,165
SHARK:
Copy that. I'm on my way.

580
00:24:07,298 --> 00:24:09,067
- (stomach burbling)
- (grunts)

581
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,436
Hurry up, guys.

582
00:24:10,569 --> 00:24:13,071
Time to turn this baby
on beast mode.

583
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,509
Eat it, WPSST!

584
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,515
Please, not now. (whimpers)

585
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:25,316
- Wolf.
- Wait, wait, wait. No, no, Piranha!

586
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:28,186
- This award is for...
- (Piranha farts loudly)

587
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,989
(clears throat)
As I was saying...

588
00:24:31,122 --> 00:24:34,493
(gasps) No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

589
00:24:36,962 --> 00:24:38,564
(sniffing)

590
00:24:38,697 --> 00:24:41,366
- Piranha! Are you kidding me?
- PIRANHA: Sorry!

591
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,602
And that's why
my Gala for Goodness

592
00:24:43,735 --> 00:24:46,505
will raise all the money needed
for those less fortunate.

593
00:24:46,638 --> 00:24:47,873
- CHIEF: Come on!
- (pounding at door)

594
00:24:48,006 --> 00:24:49,174
(inhales deeply)

595
00:24:49,775 --> 00:24:52,210
I'm starting
to get mad here, Larry.

596
00:24:53,311 --> 00:24:54,746
- WOLF: Webs! Webs!
- (muffled grunting)

597
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,517
And now the moment
we've all been waiting for.

598
00:24:59,918 --> 00:25:02,621
- (whimpering)
- Whoa!

599
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,595
(groans)

600
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:14,032
SHARK (high-pitched voice):
Excuse me.

601
00:25:14,165 --> 00:25:15,667
Is this the ladies' room?

602
00:25:15,801 --> 00:25:17,836
Oh, uh, y-you need
to take a right

603
00:25:17,969 --> 00:25:19,838
at the end of the hall, ma'am.

604
00:25:19,971 --> 00:25:22,273
(gasping)

605
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,412
Yes. Whoop-bam!

606
00:25:28,714 --> 00:25:29,781
Oh, come on!

607
00:25:30,582 --> 00:25:34,185
And now it is my honor
to award Professor Marmalade

608
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:38,389
with the Golden Dolphin!

609
00:25:40,091 --> 00:25:41,392
- (gasps) No.
- No.

610
00:25:41,527 --> 00:25:42,661
(normal voice):
Yes!

611
00:25:42,794 --> 00:25:45,030
(high-pitched voice):
I mean, yes!

612
00:25:45,163 --> 00:25:46,832
What?

613
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:50,936
(screams)

614
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:54,172
Everyone, everyone, uh,
please don't panic.

615
00:25:54,305 --> 00:25:55,607
Just stay calm.

616
00:25:55,741 --> 00:25:58,043
I'm-I'm sure there's
an explanation for this.

617
00:25:58,176 --> 00:25:59,310
(gasping, murmuring)

618
00:25:59,444 --> 00:26:02,914
I repeat, uh,
please do not panic.

619
00:26:04,516 --> 00:26:06,184
Nice work, everybody.

620
00:26:06,317 --> 00:26:09,320
Now, let's make like a wolf
and get the pack out of here.

621
00:26:09,454 --> 00:26:11,322
Ah, wordplay.

622
00:26:11,456 --> 00:26:12,624
I don't get it.

623
00:26:12,758 --> 00:26:14,626
MARMALADE:
Diane, Diane, if I may...

624
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,828
- (microphone feedback squeals)
- You have to understand,

625
00:26:16,962 --> 00:26:20,098
I didn't bring hope back
to the city for an award.

626
00:26:20,231 --> 00:26:24,135
I did these good things because
of how they made me feel.

627
00:26:24,269 --> 00:26:25,771
That tingly feeling I get.

628
00:26:25,904 --> 00:26:27,205
That shiver up my spine.

629
00:26:27,338 --> 00:26:31,109
The wag in my tiny tail.

630
00:26:31,242 --> 00:26:33,078
Because, you see,

631
00:26:33,211 --> 00:26:37,448
being good just feels so good.

632
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:41,587
And when you're good,
you're loved.

633
00:26:42,788 --> 00:26:44,690
- (gasps, whimpers)
- Wolf?

634
00:26:44,823 --> 00:26:46,224
- Wolf?
- What are you doing?

635
00:26:46,357 --> 00:26:48,326
SNAKE, SHARK and PIRANHA:
Go!

636
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:50,261
- It's the Bad Guys!
- (guests screaming)

637
00:26:50,395 --> 00:26:51,563
Arrest them!

638
00:26:51,697 --> 00:26:52,463
OFFICERS:
Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut,

639
00:26:52,598 --> 00:26:53,832
hut, hut, hut, hut, hut,

640
00:26:53,965 --> 00:26:55,801
hut, hut, hut, hut, hut,
hut, hut, hut, hut.

641
00:26:55,934 --> 00:26:57,035
(officers growl)

642
00:26:57,168 --> 00:26:58,469
They stole the Golden Dolphin!

643
00:26:58,604 --> 00:27:01,439
Come on, you can't prove that.

644
00:27:03,374 --> 00:27:05,243
(high-pitched voice):
My baby!

645
00:27:05,376 --> 00:27:06,912
- On your knees, Bad Guys.
- (knuckles crack)

646
00:27:07,045 --> 00:27:08,146
With your hands up.

647
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,315
Never! We're out of here.

648
00:27:10,448 --> 00:27:12,918
♪ ♪

649
00:27:13,051 --> 00:27:15,286
So long, suckers.

650
00:27:21,426 --> 00:27:24,129
Well, this just got
a little weird.

651
00:27:24,262 --> 00:27:26,131
(siren whooping)

652
00:27:26,264 --> 00:27:27,933
TIFFANY:
The Bad Guys go bust.

653
00:27:28,066 --> 00:27:31,069
The nefarious fivesome
has finally been captured.

654
00:27:31,202 --> 00:27:33,839
And I, Tiffany Fluffit,
am first on the scene.

655
00:27:33,972 --> 00:27:36,642
Wow. You know, I-I just
realized that I have devoted

656
00:27:36,775 --> 00:27:39,244
my entire adult life
to putting you in jail.

657
00:27:39,377 --> 00:27:40,979
You are my purpose.

658
00:27:41,112 --> 00:27:42,881
Without you, who am I?

659
00:27:43,014 --> 00:27:44,315
Ah, I'm just kidding.

660
00:27:44,449 --> 00:27:46,117
This is the best moment
of my life!

661
00:27:46,251 --> 00:27:47,285
- (smack)
- (Wolf whimpers)

662
00:27:47,418 --> 00:27:50,088
It's the end of the Bad Guys.

663
00:27:50,221 --> 00:27:51,522
No!

664
00:27:51,657 --> 00:27:53,558
Get your hands off of me!
(screams)

665
00:27:53,692 --> 00:27:56,061
Ooh, you're begging
for a biting right now.

666
00:27:56,194 --> 00:27:57,595
Wolf!

667
00:28:00,899 --> 00:28:02,634
TIFFANY: Professor Marmalade!
Madam Governor!

668
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:04,502
Ooh, Professor Marmalade!
Madam Governor!

669
00:28:04,636 --> 00:28:06,738
- Madam Governor!
- One at a time. One at a time.

670
00:28:09,307 --> 00:28:10,541
- Hey. Hey!
- Excuse me.

671
00:28:10,676 --> 00:28:12,510
- (people gasp)
- Sorry to interrupt.

672
00:28:12,644 --> 00:28:15,346
I just wanted to congratulate
the governor here.

673
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,949
I got to say,
you really got us pegged.

674
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:22,320
We're just a deep well
of anger and self-loathing.

675
00:28:22,453 --> 00:28:24,289
- Denial.
- Sure. That, too.

676
00:28:24,422 --> 00:28:25,490
- Narcissism.
- Yeah. Yeah.

677
00:28:25,623 --> 00:28:26,792
Emotional emptiness.

678
00:28:26,925 --> 00:28:28,326
- So we're on the same page.
- Hmm.

679
00:28:28,459 --> 00:28:30,428
What is he doing?

680
00:28:30,561 --> 00:28:33,598
Sadly, we were never
given a chance

681
00:28:33,732 --> 00:28:37,202
to be anything more
than second-rate criminals.

682
00:28:37,335 --> 00:28:39,805
If only there was someone
who could help

683
00:28:39,938 --> 00:28:43,474
the flower of goodness
inside us blossom.

684
00:28:43,608 --> 00:28:45,877
Some icon of love
and forgiveness,

685
00:28:46,011 --> 00:28:49,314
like, uh, I don't know,
Mother Teresa.

686
00:28:49,447 --> 00:28:52,383
Best thing is to just
throw us in jail

687
00:28:52,517 --> 00:28:55,020
for the rest
of our hopeless lives.

688
00:28:55,153 --> 00:28:56,822
Yeah, that's the plan.

689
00:28:56,955 --> 00:28:58,589
- Wait, wait, wait, no, no.
- (grunting)

690
00:28:58,724 --> 00:29:00,291
- Get in there.
- Ow!

691
00:29:00,425 --> 00:29:02,360
MARMALADE:
Wait.

692
00:29:03,161 --> 00:29:04,395
Uh, beg... beg pardon?

693
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:06,431
Mr. Wolf may be a savage beast.

694
00:29:06,564 --> 00:29:08,099
Basically walking garbage.

695
00:29:08,233 --> 00:29:09,567
Sorry, I'm making a point.

696
00:29:09,701 --> 00:29:11,302
Do what you need to do, pal.

697
00:29:11,436 --> 00:29:13,471
But how can we say
they're hopeless

698
00:29:13,604 --> 00:29:15,807
if they've never
been given a chance?

699
00:29:15,941 --> 00:29:18,910
What if... what if we tried
a little experiment, Diane?

700
00:29:19,044 --> 00:29:21,546
As you know,
my Gala for Goodness,

701
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,383
the "hashtag charity event
of the year," is coming up.

702
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:27,252
If I can prove
to everyone at that gala

703
00:29:27,385 --> 00:29:28,787
that the Bad Guys have changed,

704
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,422
will you set them free
and give them a clean start?

705
00:29:31,556 --> 00:29:32,858
(crowd gasping, murmuring)

706
00:29:32,991 --> 00:29:35,060
- What? Professor Marmalade!
- WOLF: Ow!

707
00:29:35,193 --> 00:29:37,428
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't you see what he's doing?

708
00:29:37,562 --> 00:29:39,064
He's playing you.

709
00:29:39,197 --> 00:29:40,265
But it was my idea.

710
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:41,532
It was his idea.

711
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:43,534
But only because
you made him have it.

712
00:29:43,668 --> 00:29:45,871
Madam Governor,
you can't just let them go.

713
00:29:46,004 --> 00:29:48,273
Professor, I'm not about to put
the safety of the city

714
00:29:48,406 --> 00:29:50,341
on the line for an experiment.

715
00:29:50,475 --> 00:29:51,977
Excuse me, Madam Governor.

716
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,713
I seem to remember that
a wise person once said,

717
00:29:55,847 --> 00:30:00,051
"Even trash can be recycled
into something beautiful."

718
00:30:01,052 --> 00:30:02,788
(chuckles softly)

719
00:30:03,688 --> 00:30:04,990
Okay. I'm game.

720
00:30:05,123 --> 00:30:07,658
But only because it's you,
Professor.

721
00:30:07,793 --> 00:30:08,894
No!

722
00:30:09,027 --> 00:30:11,096
We'll hold on to the Dolphin
until the gala.

723
00:30:11,229 --> 00:30:14,499
Just to remove
any unnecessary temptation.

724
00:30:14,632 --> 00:30:16,667
Of course. Good thinking.

725
00:30:16,802 --> 00:30:18,736
That's why you're governor.

726
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,139
Now that everyone's happy...

727
00:30:21,272 --> 00:30:22,607
Not happy.

728
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,243
...I, Rupert Marmalade
the Fourth,

729
00:30:25,376 --> 00:30:27,312
will turn the Bad Guys into...

730
00:30:27,445 --> 00:30:29,180
- the Good Guys!
- (cameras clicking)

731
00:30:29,314 --> 00:30:31,783
(people gasping)

732
00:30:33,785 --> 00:30:36,054
I think these belong to you.

733
00:30:36,187 --> 00:30:37,588
Hey.

734
00:30:38,689 --> 00:30:41,326
DIANE: Not everyone gets
a second chance.

735
00:30:41,459 --> 00:30:45,530
Make the most of it,
Mr. Poodleton.

736
00:30:49,234 --> 00:30:50,568
(engine starts)

737
00:30:50,701 --> 00:30:52,938
(sirens wailing)

738
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:56,241
- (chuckles)
- SNAKE: Wolf?

739
00:30:56,374 --> 00:30:57,542
What are you doing?

740
00:30:57,675 --> 00:30:59,110
- WOLF: What?
- OTHERS: Yeah.

741
00:30:59,244 --> 00:31:01,179
Oh, that. (chuckles)

742
00:31:01,312 --> 00:31:04,015
I-I-I'm sorry.
I thought it was, uh, obvious.

743
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:06,184
We're gonna go good.

744
00:31:07,385 --> 00:31:09,087
Uh, you totally lost me.

745
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,322
I told him to stop drinking
out of the toilet.

746
00:31:11,456 --> 00:31:13,391
Hey, did you get hit
on the head?

747
00:31:13,524 --> 00:31:14,759
What? No, I didn't
get hit on the head.

748
00:31:14,893 --> 00:31:16,461
My cousin got hit on
the head with an anchor,

749
00:31:16,594 --> 00:31:18,229
and after that,
he only swam in a circle.

750
00:31:18,363 --> 00:31:20,431
WOLF: No, no, g-guys, guys,
you're not following me.

751
00:31:20,565 --> 00:31:23,468
We're gonna pretend to go good.

752
00:31:23,601 --> 00:31:25,136
Just a few days with Marmalade.

753
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:29,274
And then we roll into the gala
as Good Guys

754
00:31:29,407 --> 00:31:32,610
and roll out scot-free with...

755
00:31:32,743 --> 00:31:35,546
ALL:
The Golden Dolphin.

756
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,814
You got it.

757
00:31:36,948 --> 00:31:39,084
Since when do we not
finish a job?

758
00:31:39,217 --> 00:31:42,487
The Bad Guys become
the Good Guys

759
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,756
so we can stay the Bad Guys.

760
00:31:45,891 --> 00:31:48,326
- You know what I'm saying?
- (laughter)

761
00:31:48,459 --> 00:31:49,861
Bad Guys acting good?

762
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:51,696
It's the ultimate Bad Guy thing.

763
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:53,131
It's fantastic.

764
00:31:53,264 --> 00:31:54,565
Wolf, you're a genius.

765
00:31:54,699 --> 00:31:56,134
(laughter continues)

766
00:31:56,267 --> 00:31:58,603
It's gonna be, like,
the most relaxing con ever,

767
00:31:58,736 --> 00:32:00,205
like a vacation.

768
00:32:00,338 --> 00:32:02,573
Oh, oh. A con-cation.

769
00:32:02,707 --> 00:32:04,342
(laughter)

770
00:32:04,475 --> 00:32:08,146
SHARK: Ooh! My parents met
on a con-cation.

771
00:32:10,181 --> 00:32:12,050
(seagulls squawking)

772
00:32:12,183 --> 00:32:14,485
♪ ♪

773
00:32:14,619 --> 00:32:16,287
(Marmalade humming)

774
00:32:20,725 --> 00:32:22,093
(doorbell rings)

775
00:32:22,227 --> 00:32:23,394
Oh, goody.

776
00:32:23,528 --> 00:32:24,963
WOLF (chuckling):
Wow.

777
00:32:25,096 --> 00:32:26,564
Big and fancy.

778
00:32:26,697 --> 00:32:28,866
Rodent's got taste. Okay.

779
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,769
Huh. Almost makes me
want to be cute.

780
00:32:31,903 --> 00:32:35,273
MARMALADE: They say experience
is the best teacher.

781
00:32:35,406 --> 00:32:37,108
And they are wrong.

782
00:32:37,242 --> 00:32:38,476
I am.

783
00:32:38,609 --> 00:32:40,811
Good morning,
students of goodness.

784
00:32:40,946 --> 00:32:46,084
And welcome to the first day
of the rest of your best life.

785
00:32:46,217 --> 00:32:47,418
A giant butt.

786
00:32:47,552 --> 00:32:48,753
Huh?

787
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:50,388
Uh, it's-it's not a butt.

788
00:32:50,521 --> 00:32:53,024
It's a lamp in the shape of

789
00:32:53,158 --> 00:32:55,293
the Love Crater Meteorite,
my greatest...

790
00:32:55,426 --> 00:32:57,362
- I wonder whose butt it is.
- (Shark gasps) - WOLF: Uh...

791
00:32:58,163 --> 00:33:00,165
Once again, it's not a butt.
Thank you.

792
00:33:00,298 --> 00:33:02,167
It's a heart.
Now, as I was saying...

793
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,569
- Then why does it have cheeks?
- (shushing) - Shut it!

794
00:33:04,702 --> 00:33:06,437
What? I've never seen
a heart with cheeks.

795
00:33:06,571 --> 00:33:08,039
(scoffs) It's not a...

796
00:33:08,173 --> 00:33:10,541
- Booty!
- It's not a butt! Not a butt!

797
00:33:10,675 --> 00:33:13,111
Does he know what a butt is?

798
00:33:13,244 --> 00:33:14,980
(clears throat)
As I was saying,

799
00:33:15,113 --> 00:33:17,949
on the outside,
the five of you are villains,

800
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:20,051
predators,
remorseless sociopaths.

801
00:33:20,185 --> 00:33:22,253
Oh, stop.
You're making me blush.

802
00:33:22,387 --> 00:33:24,122
But inside, there's a flower...

803
00:33:24,255 --> 00:33:27,092
the flower of goodness...
and when it blooms

804
00:33:27,225 --> 00:33:29,627
and you feel that tingle
of positivity

805
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,262
radiating through your body,

806
00:33:31,396 --> 00:33:34,465
you're going to want to feel it
all the time.

807
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:36,267
So we're going for a tingle?

808
00:33:36,401 --> 00:33:37,602
Not any tingle.

809
00:33:37,735 --> 00:33:39,837
The tingle of goodness,
which you'll feel

810
00:33:39,971 --> 00:33:43,208
in my state-of-the-art
Sharing Laboratory.

811
00:33:43,341 --> 00:33:47,245
Okay, Mr. Snake, I'm going
to give you a Push Pop.

812
00:33:47,378 --> 00:33:49,814
Great! Push Pop just for me!

813
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:52,550
- No, to share.
- Why?

814
00:33:52,683 --> 00:33:54,552
Well, on a fundamental level,

815
00:33:54,685 --> 00:33:56,654
it's about putting
someone else's needs

816
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:59,124
- ahead of your own.
- (chuckling)

817
00:33:59,257 --> 00:34:00,992
Oh, no. No way.

818
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:02,860
Snake.

819
00:34:02,994 --> 00:34:05,596
(groans)
All right, all right.

820
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,598
This is going to taste
extra sweet,

821
00:34:07,732 --> 00:34:10,235
'cause I know how bad
you want it.

822
00:34:10,368 --> 00:34:12,670
(groaning)

823
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:14,639
Pop me, please. Ah...

824
00:34:14,772 --> 00:34:17,008
(groaning)

825
00:34:18,543 --> 00:34:20,378
Nope. Sucker.

826
00:34:20,511 --> 00:34:21,612
- That's it!
- (gasps)

827
00:34:21,746 --> 00:34:23,514
- I'll teach you to share!
- (screams)

828
00:34:23,648 --> 00:34:24,815
(all gasp)

829
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:26,951
Mm, I like sharing.
It's yummy. Mm.

830
00:34:27,085 --> 00:34:28,786
SNAKE (echoing):
Totally worth it.

831
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:31,022
Well, that's terrifying.

832
00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:33,091
Let's try something simpler.

833
00:34:33,224 --> 00:34:35,626
A good person always
pays attention

834
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,095
to the needs of others.

835
00:34:37,228 --> 00:34:39,764
Now, here's a kindly,
frail grandma.

836
00:34:39,897 --> 00:34:41,766
(others laughing)

837
00:34:41,899 --> 00:34:45,236
Mr. Piranha, help grandma
across the street.

838
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:48,139
(scoffs) Sure, sure, sure.
I do this all the time.

839
00:34:48,939 --> 00:34:51,742
- Here you go, ma'am.
- (others laughing)

840
00:34:51,876 --> 00:34:53,711
Oh, he is totally gonna blow it.

841
00:34:53,844 --> 00:34:55,246
What was that? What did you say

842
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,847
- You think I can't do this?
- (Tarantula laughing)

843
00:34:56,981 --> 00:34:59,284
- No, no, no, Piranha!
- (truck horn blares)

844
00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:02,220
(Wolf screams, groans)

845
00:35:02,353 --> 00:35:04,222
Maybe simpler?

846
00:35:04,355 --> 00:35:06,291
(cat meowing)

847
00:35:06,424 --> 00:35:09,194
Hey, look.
It's a cat stuck in a tree.

848
00:35:09,327 --> 00:35:11,329
It doesn't get much simpler
than that.

849
00:35:11,462 --> 00:35:13,364
Now, what in this scenario

850
00:35:13,498 --> 00:35:15,400
would give you that good tingle?

851
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:17,001
Eating it?

852
00:35:17,135 --> 00:35:19,270
This is why I always carry
two pieces of bread with me.

853
00:35:19,404 --> 00:35:20,438
No.

854
00:35:20,571 --> 00:35:23,308
I want you to s...

855
00:35:23,441 --> 00:35:24,575
- Smack it.
- Skin it?

856
00:35:24,709 --> 00:35:26,344
- Stab it.
- Sauté it. - Sing to it?

857
00:35:26,477 --> 00:35:28,246
Save it. I want you to sa...

858
00:35:28,379 --> 00:35:30,515
That's obv... It's so obvi...
I want you to save it.

859
00:35:30,648 --> 00:35:31,916
ALL:
Oh!

860
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:33,818
- Right, right.
- Right, right, right. Sure.

861
00:35:34,819 --> 00:35:37,388
- Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
- (growling)

862
00:35:37,522 --> 00:35:38,656
(meows)

863
00:35:38,789 --> 00:35:40,458
Whoa, that cat is
obviously defective.

864
00:35:40,591 --> 00:35:41,759
What is wrong with you?

865
00:35:41,892 --> 00:35:43,428
You're gonna give it
a heart attack.

866
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:45,230
(scoffs)
I'll handle this.

867
00:35:46,063 --> 00:35:48,333
- What's up, papa!
- (yowls)

868
00:35:48,466 --> 00:35:49,834
(Wolf grunts)

869
00:35:49,967 --> 00:35:52,270
(screams) Get him off my face!
He's on my face!

870
00:35:52,403 --> 00:35:54,572
No, no, no, no, no, listen!
Wh-What are you doing?

871
00:35:54,705 --> 00:35:55,806
(cat yowling)

872
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,908
(Wolf groans)

873
00:35:59,377 --> 00:36:02,913
Okay. What, may I ask,

- Yeah. Who's a good kitty?
- (meows)

1050
00:43:05,069 --> 00:43:06,971
- Who's a good kitty?
- TARANTULA: Uh, Wolf?

1051
00:43:07,104 --> 00:43:09,907
Um, you saved him?

1052
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,308
MARMALADE:
Yes!

1053
00:43:11,441 --> 00:43:14,378
(chuckling):
Yes. It's working.

1054
00:43:14,511 --> 00:43:15,746
You-you filmed that?

1055
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,315
Yes, and they're starting
to like you.

1056
00:43:18,448 --> 00:43:19,483
SHARK (chuckling):
Yeah!

1057
00:43:19,617 --> 00:43:21,351
- All right!
- (whooping)

1058
00:43:21,485 --> 00:43:22,620
This might just be enough

1059
00:43:22,753 --> 00:43:24,088
to win over the guests
at the gala.

1060
00:43:24,221 --> 00:43:26,190
- Now we're talking!
- Yes! - All right!

1061
00:43:26,323 --> 00:43:28,926
TARANTULA:
Yeah, we did it! All right!

1062
00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:30,695
MARMALADE:
Uh, Wolf?

1063
00:43:30,828 --> 00:43:33,230
I must say,
you've really turned a corner.

1064
00:43:33,363 --> 00:43:35,232
- You're really getting it.
- Really?

1065
00:43:35,365 --> 00:43:36,934
- Oh, uh, thanks.
- (meows)

1066
00:43:37,067 --> 00:43:38,102
Now, I mean it.

1067
00:43:38,235 --> 00:43:40,170
And I can see it
from tip to tail.

1068
00:43:40,938 --> 00:43:44,474
It's just a shame that you
have to carry all that baggage.

1069
00:43:45,342 --> 00:43:47,845
What are you talk...
You mean the guys?

1070
00:43:47,978 --> 00:43:49,246
What do you mean?

1071
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:50,748
MARMALADE:
You have great potential, Wolf,

1072
00:43:50,881 --> 00:43:52,349
but at some point,
you're going to have to choose

1073
00:43:52,482 --> 00:43:55,620
between your friends
or the good life.

1074
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:01,826
(snoring)

1075
00:44:04,494 --> 00:44:06,664
Hey. You still awake?

1076
00:44:06,797 --> 00:44:08,332
(cat meows)

1077
00:44:08,465 --> 00:44:10,034
You-you brought the cat in?

1078
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:11,869
(chuckling):
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1079
00:44:12,002 --> 00:44:13,938
I'm just...
I'm just saving it up for later.

1080
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:15,472
Why? What's up?

1081
00:44:16,306 --> 00:44:17,942
I was just getting
a little worried,

1082
00:44:18,075 --> 00:44:19,744
since you've kind of become a...

1083
00:44:19,877 --> 00:44:21,846
- Become a what?
- (purring)

1084
00:44:21,979 --> 00:44:24,014
You know, teacher's pet.

1085
00:44:24,148 --> 00:44:26,350
Getting all cozy with Marmalade.

1086
00:44:26,483 --> 00:44:28,452
Your tail wagging
and everything.

1087
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:30,554
Well, yeah, because
it has to be believable.

1088
00:44:30,688 --> 00:44:33,423
Uh-huh. Yeah, I guess so.

1089
00:44:33,557 --> 00:44:36,160
As long as it's all
part of the plan.

1090
00:44:37,027 --> 00:44:39,596
It is all part of the plan,
isn't it?

1091
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:42,867
Snake, buddy,
who made the plan to begin with?

1092
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,401
You did.

1093
00:44:44,534 --> 00:44:48,005
So I'm the one who sticks
to the plan the most, right?

1094
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,208
Yeah, ri... Uh, yeah, ok...

1095
00:44:51,341 --> 00:44:53,577
I guess that makes sense, yeah.

1096
00:44:53,711 --> 00:44:56,113
But if the plan
were ever to change,

1097
00:44:56,246 --> 00:44:58,949
you'd-you'd tell me, right?

1098
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:03,587
You have my word.

1099
00:45:03,721 --> 00:45:05,756
Go bad...

1100
00:45:06,556 --> 00:45:08,458
Or go home.

1101
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,468
- Hey, Snake. - Yeah?
- (purring)

1102
00:45:18,602 --> 00:45:20,805
You ever wonder
what it'd be like?

1103
00:45:20,938 --> 00:45:23,607
The world loving us
instead of being scared of us?

1104
00:45:23,741 --> 00:45:25,642
You ever...
you ever think about that?

1105
00:45:25,776 --> 00:45:26,911
Loving us?

1106
00:45:27,044 --> 00:45:28,445
(chuckles) Yeah, right.

1107
00:45:28,578 --> 00:45:30,514
I don't waste time
thinking about stuff

1108
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:32,182
that's never gonna happen.

1109
00:45:32,316 --> 00:45:36,721
(sighs) I can't wait for things
to get back to normal.

1110
00:45:43,761 --> 00:45:46,363
Yeah. Back to normal,
back to normal.

1111
00:45:47,397 --> 00:45:49,399
(sighs)

1112
00:45:50,634 --> 00:45:52,737
(dramatic news theme plays)

1113
00:45:54,872 --> 00:45:57,374
What up?
We are just moments away

1114
00:45:57,507 --> 00:45:59,409
from Professor Marmalade's
Gala for Goodness,

1115
00:45:59,543 --> 00:46:01,578
where the legendary
Love Crater Meteorite

1116
00:46:01,712 --> 00:46:04,715
will be on display
for the first time ever.

1117
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:07,484
But what everyone
is really buzzing about

1118
00:46:07,617 --> 00:46:10,955
is the Bad Guys, whose
heart-melting rescue video

1119
00:46:11,088 --> 00:46:14,925
has made them an overnight
viral sensation.

1120
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,395
All right, guys,
this is the big one.

1121
00:46:18,528 --> 00:46:20,130
The Golden Dolphin

1122
00:46:20,264 --> 00:46:21,732
is inside a titanium case

1123
00:46:21,866 --> 00:46:23,700
controlled by a randomly
generated five-digit code,

1124
00:46:23,834 --> 00:46:25,369
a code kept safe and secure

1125
00:46:25,502 --> 00:46:28,405
inside a briefcase handcuffed
to the chief of police.

1126
00:46:28,538 --> 00:46:30,407
PIRANHA:
She's not messing around.

1127
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,109
WOLF: The code is only
accessible with

1128
00:46:32,242 --> 00:46:33,844
- her authorized fingerprints.
- SNAKE: Leave that to me.

1129
00:46:33,978 --> 00:46:35,913
WOLF:
While Snake gets the code,

1130
00:46:36,046 --> 00:46:37,414
Shark will secure
the fake Dolphin.

1131
00:46:37,547 --> 00:46:39,149
SHARK:
I like the sound of that.

1132
00:46:39,283 --> 00:46:41,018
WOLF: Meanwhile, the rest of us
plant circuit jammers.

1133
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,120
TARANTULA: Allowing me
to hack into the power grid.

1134
00:46:43,253 --> 00:46:44,822
WOLF: At the end of the night,
we toast the professor,

1135
00:46:44,955 --> 00:46:46,857
"Blah-blah-blah, yada yada,"

1136
00:46:46,991 --> 00:46:49,393
and when I say "Marmalade,"
lights go out,

1137
00:46:49,526 --> 00:46:52,329
and we'll have exactly
four seconds to make our move.

1138
00:46:52,462 --> 00:46:54,364
SNAKE:
The old switcheroo.

1139
00:46:54,498 --> 00:46:57,167
WOLF: Chief hands Marmalade
the fake Dolphin,

1140
00:46:57,301 --> 00:47:00,270
we get our pardon, applause,
applause, exit stage right,

1141
00:47:00,404 --> 00:47:02,873
and by the time they realize
what happened...

1142
00:47:03,007 --> 00:47:04,574
(over speakers):
So long, suckers!

1143
00:47:04,708 --> 00:47:06,343
...we'll be driving off
into the sunset,

1144
00:47:06,476 --> 00:47:07,644
legacy cemented.

1145
00:47:07,778 --> 00:47:09,113
- (laughter)
- PIRANHA: Nice.

1146
00:47:09,246 --> 00:47:10,514
Got to hand it to you, buddy.

1147
00:47:10,647 --> 00:47:12,582
You're a real artist.

1148
00:47:15,185 --> 00:47:17,121
Well, Good Guys, this is it.

1149
00:47:17,254 --> 00:47:18,655
Good luck out there.

1150
00:47:18,789 --> 00:47:22,626
Remember, all eyes will be
on you tonight, not me.

1151
00:47:22,759 --> 00:47:26,630
Friends, meet the Good Guys!

1152

(cheering)

1153
00:47:32,336 --> 00:47:34,338
Uh, this is different.

1154
00:47:34,471 --> 00:47:36,440
- Is this a prank?
- What's that sound?

1155
00:47:36,573 --> 00:47:38,642
Like screaming
but not terrified.

1156
00:47:38,775 --> 00:47:41,611

1219
00:50:13,197 --> 00:50:14,664
You know,
if I didn't know better,

1220
00:50:14,798 --> 00:50:16,200
I'd think that
you were avoiding me.

1221
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:17,534
Avoiding you?

1222
00:50:17,667 --> 00:50:19,336
Wh-Why would I do that?

1223
00:50:20,337 --> 00:50:21,705
Okay.

1224
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:25,375
But I have to say,
I'm a little disappointed.

1225
00:50:26,176 --> 00:50:29,146
I was hoping you were gonna
ask me to dance.

1226
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:30,480

Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Wolf.

1283
00:52:52,489 --> 00:52:54,057
As you know,
the money raised tonight

1284
00:52:54,191 --> 00:52:57,194
will be delivered tomorrow
to schools, hospitals

Uh... (clears throat)

1288
00:53:03,032 --> 00:53:06,069
I just want to take
a moment to recognize

1289
00:53:06,203 --> 00:53:08,338
the one responsible
for our new outlook.

1290
00:53:08,472 --> 00:53:10,974
Our brilliant mentor,

1291
00:53:11,107 --> 00:53:12,709
- a paragon of enlightenment...
- Do it. - Come on.

1292
00:53:12,842 --> 00:53:15,845
...the one and only
Professor...

1293
00:53:18,482 --> 00:53:20,650
- TARANTULA: Wolf, do it.
- WOLF: ...uh, Professor...

1294
00:53:20,784 --> 00:53:22,051
(hisses)

1295
00:53:22,186 --> 00:53:24,388
...um...

1296
00:53:26,223 --> 00:53:28,358
...Professor Marmalade!

1297
00:53:28,492 --> 00:53:30,160
(cheering)

1298
00:53:31,027 --> 00:53:33,297
Chief, may I do the honors?

1299
00:53:36,466 --> 00:53:37,601
That's not the plan.

1300
00:53:37,734 --> 00:53:38,768
What is happening?

1301
00:53:38,902 --> 00:53:40,304
He's gone rogue.

1302
00:53:41,771 --> 00:53:43,607
A deal's a deal.

1303
00:53:44,641 --> 00:53:47,477
By the power vested in me,
it is a pleasure

1304
00:53:47,611 --> 00:53:50,113
to grant the Bad Guys
a full par...

1305
00:53:50,247 --> 00:53:52,482
(guests gasping, murmuring)

1306
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:56,720
- That was weird.
- MAN: The meteorite is gone!

1307
00:53:56,853 --> 00:53:58,222
Somebody stole it!

1308
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:02,192
- (chief groans)
- Chief.

1309
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:04,194
- Wolf. (growls)
- Come on.

1310
00:54:04,328 --> 00:54:05,962
You can't possibly think
that we did this.

1311
00:54:06,095 --> 00:54:08,298
(over speakers):
So long, suckers!

1312
00:54:09,399 --> 00:54:10,800
Run!

1313
00:54:10,934 --> 00:54:12,269
Get them!

1314
00:54:12,402 --> 00:54:14,904

1315
00:54:19,676 --> 00:54:22,011

- (panting)
- (officers grunting)

1317
00:54:25,715 --> 00:54:27,384
Here. Here.

1318
00:54:27,517 --> 00:54:30,086
- What are you doing?
- I'm giving it all back.

1319
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,321
Huh?

1320
00:54:31,455 --> 00:54:33,523
- (clamoring)
- Excuse me.

1321
00:54:33,657 --> 00:54:35,692
(panting, grunting)

1322
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,062
- What happened back there?
- I couldn't do it.

1323
00:54:39,195 --> 00:54:40,930
What do you mean,
you couldn't do it?

1324
00:54:41,064 --> 00:54:42,332
- I-I-I just... I...
- No!

1325
00:54:42,466 --> 00:54:44,768
- I do not run.
- OFFICERS: Hut, hut, hut...

1326
00:54:44,901 --> 00:54:46,570
That is not how I roll.

1327
00:54:46,703 --> 00:54:48,505
Piranha,
don't do anything crazy.

1328
00:54:48,638 --> 00:54:49,973
(laughing)

1329
00:54:50,106 --> 00:54:53,410
Crazy is what I bring
to the party, chico.

1330
00:54:57,747 --> 00:54:59,916
(Shark groans)

1331
00:55:01,285 --> 00:55:02,652
Hey, you're making a mistake.

1332
00:55:02,786 --> 00:55:03,753
We didn't do it.

1333
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:05,021
I know we always say that,

1334
00:55:05,154 --> 00:55:06,222
but this time
it's actually true.

1335
00:55:06,356 --> 00:55:08,224
A-la-la-la-la. Can't hear you.

1336
00:55:08,358 --> 00:55:10,460
- Guilty, guilty, guilty.
- Talk to Marmalade.

1337
00:55:10,594 --> 00:55:12,396
We're really good now.
He'll tell you.

1338
00:55:12,529 --> 00:55:13,630
Professor!

1339
00:55:13,763 --> 00:55:16,032
Tonight's headline:
Change is impossible.

1340
00:55:16,165 --> 00:55:18,034
You should always judge
a book by its cover,

1341
00:55:18,167 --> 00:55:20,404
and all stereotypes
have been affirmed.

1342
00:55:20,537 --> 00:55:22,138
MARMALADE:
Stop, for goodness' sake!

1343
00:55:22,272 --> 00:55:23,573
Let me speak to them.

1344
00:55:23,707 --> 00:55:26,242
I'm-I'm sure there's been
some misunderstanding.

1345
00:55:27,043 --> 00:55:29,178
- (door opens)
- Ah, Professor Marmalade.

1346
00:55:29,313 --> 00:55:30,680
You've got five minutes.

1347
00:55:30,814 --> 00:55:32,816
No deals this time.

1348
00:55:32,949 --> 00:55:33,983
Y-You have to help us.

1349
00:55:34,117 --> 00:55:35,652
Tell 'em.
Tell 'em we didn't do it.

1350
00:55:35,785 --> 00:55:37,654
There, there.
Of course you didn't do it.

1351
00:55:37,787 --> 00:55:38,922
How could you?

1352
00:55:39,055 --> 00:55:42,426
After all,
you're such a good boy.

1353
00:55:43,226 --> 00:55:46,596
You're such a good boy.

1354
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:48,432
That shiver up my spine.

1355
00:55:48,565 --> 00:55:50,800
The wag in my tiny tail.

1356
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:52,168
Arrest them!

1357
00:55:52,302 --> 00:55:54,070
What if we tried
a little experiment, Diane?

1358
00:55:54,203 --> 00:55:56,506
As you know,
my Gala for Goodness...

1359
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,875
TIFFANY: Where the legendary
Love Crater Meteorite

1360
00:55:59,008 --> 00:56:01,545
will be on display
for the first time ever.

1361
00:56:01,678 --> 00:56:04,981
All eyes will be
on you tonight, not me.

1362
00:56:05,815 --> 00:56:07,050
WOMAN:
You're such a...

1363
00:56:07,183 --> 00:56:09,486
MARMALADE:
Good boy.

1364
00:56:10,487 --> 00:56:11,888
You.

1365
00:56:12,021 --> 00:56:13,590
It was all you.

1366
00:56:13,723 --> 00:56:15,124
What are you talking about,
Wolf?

1367
00:56:15,258 --> 00:56:16,526
The old lady,
the Golden Dolphin,

1368
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,395
good training...
it was all to get us here,

1369
00:56:18,528 --> 00:56:20,764
so he could steal the meteorite
and let us take the fall.

1370
00:56:20,897 --> 00:56:22,566
Whoa. Whoa, what old lady?

1371
00:56:22,699 --> 00:56:25,201
And-and why would a guinea pig
want a meteorite anyway?

1372
00:56:25,335 --> 00:56:28,104
(Marmalade chuckling)

1373
00:56:28,237 --> 00:56:31,040
Uh, guys, he's creeping me out.

1374
00:56:31,174 --> 00:56:32,776
Wait, what? What's going on?

1375
00:56:32,909 --> 00:56:34,177
Someone turn me around.

1376
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:35,945
MARMALADE:
Well, well.

1377
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:37,981
So, you finally get it.

1378
00:56:38,114 --> 00:56:39,516
- Wait.
- What?

1379
00:56:39,649 --> 00:56:41,117
You stole the meteorite?

1380
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:43,219
Oh, it's not just a meteorite.

1381
00:56:43,353 --> 00:56:44,788
I told you guys it's a butt.

1382
00:56:44,921 --> 00:56:46,122
It's not a butt!

1383
00:56:46,255 --> 00:56:47,457
(takes deep breath)

1384
00:56:47,591 --> 00:56:50,059
It's the ultimate power source.

1385
00:56:50,193 --> 00:56:53,062
You see, when it struck,
scientists found that

1386
00:56:53,196 --> 00:56:54,931
it emitted
an electromagnetic frequency

1387
00:56:55,064 --> 00:56:57,000
unlike anything else on Earth.

1388
00:56:57,133 --> 00:56:58,802
I'm going to harness its power

1389
00:56:58,935 --> 00:57:02,138
to pull off the greatest heist
