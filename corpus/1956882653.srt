00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,224
Or, who are we?

183
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,325
You know, cause that's more
of a metaphysical question.

184
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:41,293
Now I's probably something...

185
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,262
you should be asking yourself,
not a couple of strangers.

186
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,697
We're looking for, um,
a Mister S..., uh...

187
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:46,599
Sarafanov?

188
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,700
Sarafanov. Yes.

189
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:49,602
Is he home?

190
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,403
No.

191
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,207
He'll be right back though.

192
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:57,377
How do you know him?

193
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,881
Well, that is a difficult
question to answer for...

194
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:03,649
Your dad and I,

195
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,751
we, uh, we go back.

196
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:06,853
You see, the thing is, is...

197
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:08,254
Nikita.

198
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:09,721
Nikita. That's a great name.

199
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:10,756
Parlez-vous français?

200
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,691
It's Russian.

201
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:13,793
Nikita.

202
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,131
And the sad thing is, is that

203
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,735
I...

204
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:27,539
I haven't even met your old man.

205
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,308
But I thought you
said you go way back.

206
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,078
We do. We do.

207
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,847
Max and I, we,

208
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:38,484
Shit, I might as
well just say it.

209
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,120
Yeah. Yeah, you should probably
just go ahead and say it.

210
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,491
Max Sarafanov

211
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,560
Happens to be...

212
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:52,565
My father...

213
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,010
I don't think he even
knows I was born.

214
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,149
So Nikita, that means
you and I are...

215
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,454
How bout you give your
big brother a hug, huh?

216
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:22,295
This is a beautiful moment.

217
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:24,197
For both of you.

218
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:26,266
Yeah.

219
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,302
Yeah, go to him.

220
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:33,006
Come on.

221
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,015
I have to tell you something.

222
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,119
I don't really like
talking dirty during sex.

223
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:49,356
You don't?

224
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,660
I just fake it to
make you happy.

225
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,462
You're really good at it.

226
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:57,364
At times I...

227
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,899
think I'm just using you
to get me out of this dump.

228
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,369
So use me.

229
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,404
Tha's the foundation
of a good marriage.

230
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,306
You fake it...

231
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,242
and I take you with me
when I go to Houston.

232
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,647
You sure about that?

233
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:16,549
What kind of question is that?

234
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,452
I'm gonna marry you.

235
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,723
I'm not pilot's wife material.

236
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:25,891
Yes you are.

237
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:27,759
No, I'm not.

238
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,029
I... I have a tattoo

239
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:34,166
I's not like yo're
potato and 'm po-tah-to.

240
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35,168
You're a cheeseburger
and I'm borscht.

241
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,239
I'm taking you with me
because I don't have a choice.

242
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,241
I don't, huh?

243
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,510
I love borscht.

244
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:49,448
Do I have to climb
out the window again?

245
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,350
[Cork Pops]

246
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:57,390
Thank you.

247
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,126
Welcome!

248
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:00,593
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

249
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:12,038
So Nikita.

250
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,939
Where's your, um,

251
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,175
your mom, like, Mrs. Sarafanov?

252
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,111
No, no, no. There isn't
a Mrs. Sarafanov.

253
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,249
I know a single parent
when I see one.

254
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,317
It's true.

255
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:26,486
When I was six, my mom, uh,

256
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,257
test drove this Trans Am with
this guy looked like Robert Redford.

257
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:33,326
Uh, we never saw her again.

258
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:35,428
Wow.

259
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:37,364
Bummer.

260
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,233
Anyway. Uh, Pringles?

261
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:43,170
I always love a
Pringle. Thank you.

262
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:52,078
[Knocking]

263
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,745
It's my dad

264
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,514
Your dad!

265
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,649
Our Dad!

266
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,554
Hey. Hey. I have something
important to tell you.

267
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:04,356
Listen.

268
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,858
I was just as young
and mad as you once.

269
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,727
Just exactly.

270
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,230
You can say that again.

271
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:12,864
You can't help it.

272
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,033
A mix of warrior, poet,

273
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,469
boils through your veins.

274
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,805
I's a family curse.

275
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:20,373
What are you doing?

276
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,141
I'm fucking starving.

277
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:21,374
Well, let's go.

278
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,275
Jesus look.

279
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,144
I'm a little high...

280
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:26,413
Okay, just get the Pringles and
let's get the fuck outta here.

281
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:29,782
What?

282
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:33,620
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

283
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:40,627
What?

284
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:43,296
Look at this.

285
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:45,432
What the...?

286
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:46,466
Have you been drinking?

287
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,768
Well, well, I had a little
champagne for the occasion.

288
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,938
You're fourteen years old.

289
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:53,773
Everything you do is illegal.

290
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:56,409
Do you want to spend the
rest of your life in prison?

291
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,379
Your son is in the kitchen.

292
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:02,849
Your elder son.

293
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,287
To my Russian bear.

294
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:09,322
This is a no-brainer,
I'm telling you.

295
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:11,523
No way.

296
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:11,958
What do you mean no way?

297
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,692
No way.

298
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,195
Why in the hell would
we go anyplace else?

299
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:16,729
Nobod's gonna look for us here.

300
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:20,499
Look, how is, how the hell am I
gonna convince a total fucking stranger

301
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,933
that he's my father?

302
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,635
Wait, wait. Your real father
is a total fucking stranger.

303
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:24,571
He might as well be this guy.

304
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:28,375
Come on. I's worth a try.

305
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:29,642
[Door opens]

306
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:38,851
[Door closes]

307
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,786
Good evening.

308
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,754
Max Sarafanov.

309
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,291
Skip Retcho. Really
good to meet you, sir.

310
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:45,892
Bo.

311
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:52,465
I's, uh, short for,
for Beauregard.

312
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,367
So?

313
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,968
How can I help you, Beauregard?

314
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:00,606
Sir, we, we,

315
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:02,974
apologize for just showing up
here like this out of the blue.

316
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,511
But, uh,

317
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:08,947
, coming to meet his biological father
was a very big decision for my friend.

318
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,950
Well, unfortunately,

319
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:13,520
I'm afraid, uh, this is some
sort of misunderstanding.

320
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:17,457
Sir, he's not asking for much.
Just a little bit of your time?

321
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:21,827
I hate to disappoint you.

322
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:25,297
I really hope you find
your father sometime soon.

323
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:27,234
But, yo've got the wrong man.

324
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:35,341
'Ve been waiting for this moment

325
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,677
since the day I learned to talk.

326
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:40,879
And I's okay.

327
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,950
Dad. I, I have no
expectations and no regrets.

328
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:46,752
But I never had another son.

329
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:47,953
Are you sure?

330
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:48,588
Of course I'm sure.

331
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,292
Hundred percent sure.

332
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,560
When's your birthday?

333
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:56,363
August fourteenth 1980.

334
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,565
What's going on?

335
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:01,099
You did't tell me
you had a sister.

336
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,668
What do you mean sister?

337
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,470
We have a brother.

338
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:06,004
-Ca't you tell?
I mean, he is a,

339
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:07,307
a Sarafanov through and through.

340
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:09,409
Dad, who are these people?

341
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:13,845
Honey, uh, this nice young man

342
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:16,014
is a bit confused.

343
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,351
He thinks that he and I
might be related potentially.

344
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:23,389
Potentially. This guy.
Potentially. I mean, ca't you see?

345
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,123
How much they
look alike in the...?

346
00:20:24,124 --> 00:20:25,424
No.

347
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:26,658
H's got Dad's eyes.

348
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:28,560
Exactly.

349
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,663
No, he does't. Our father
has beautiful eyes.

350
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:33,600
Lolita, there is no reason to be rude.
Beauregard has the nice blue eyes.

351
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:40,238
You can't just let these perfect
strangers waltz into our house and

352
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,807
eat our fucking Pringles.

353
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:43,141
Shame on you.

354
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:43,743
Are you up for adoption, too?

355
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:47,713
Listen, if you want us to leave,
then just say the word.

356
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:49,748
Leave

357
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,049
It was nice to meet you, Dad.

358
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,851
What's her name?

359
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:54,620
Your mother?

360
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:56,722
Janice.

361
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:57,990
Janice Who?

362
00:20:58,925 --> 00:20:59,859

01:06:03,227 --> 01:06:04,094
you made a believer out of me.

1092
01:06:05,662 --> 01:06:06,997
So, to Max!

1093
01:06:07,831 --> 01:06:08,498
Brilliant musician

1094
01:06:09,533 --> 01:06:11,767
and soon to be
recognized composer.

1095
01:06:11,768 --> 01:06:13,069
But...

1096
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:14,171
more importantly,

1097
01:06:17,374 --> 01:06:18,308
to a hell of a father

1098
01:06:20,044 --> 01:06:22,178
In two days,

1099
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:23,147
you've done more for
me as a father...

1100
01:06:25,115 --> 01:06:26,583
than most sons get
in a lifetime.

1101
01:06:28,285 --> 01:06:29,753
Spoken like a true Russian.

1102
01:06:37,094 --> 01:06:37,727
Thank you, son.

1103
01:06:39,196 --> 01:06:39,996
Nastrovia.

1104
01:07:35,185 --> 01:07:36,719
Uh...

1105
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:37,387
Hey, buddy Look.

1106
01:07:46,763 --> 01:07:47,464
Nikita.

1107
01:07:53,637 --> 01:07:54,771
Nikita...

1108
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:57,441
[Gasps]

1109
01:07:58,542 --> 01:08:00,410
Stop!

1110
01:08:02,045 --> 01:08:04,147
Sorry, Mr. Sarafanov.

1111
01:08:04,148 --> 01:08:06,048
But I got a photographic memory.

1112
01:08:06,049 --> 01:08:07,316
Like an elephant.

1113
01:08:07,317 --> 01:08:08,984
What instrument do you play?

1114
01:08:08,985 --> 01:08:10,187
He plays the clarinet.

1115
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:14,490
Of course, the clarinet. That's,
tha's where I knew you from.

1116
01:08:14,491 --> 01:08:15,824
I've seen him play
the clarinet before.

1117
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:17,593
Oh, let go of it, okay?

1118
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:20,529
No, it was at Sunset
Acres Nursing Home.

1119
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:21,897
Tha's where I saw him.

1120
01:08:21,898 --> 01:08:23,766
You're mistaking him
with someone else.

1121
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:24,668
No, I'm not.

1122
01:08:24,669 --> 01:08:26,068
Yes, you are.

1123
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:26,803
Wha's your problem?

1124
01:08:26,804 --> 01:08:28,937
You are.

1125
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,573
Mr. Sarafanov. Tell them.
My grandmother loves you.

1126
01:08:30,574 --> 01:08:32,375
Ida Johnson?

1127
01:08:32,376 --> 01:08:34,009
She's ninety-seven years old
and she's always in the corner

1128
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:35,478
yelling, bravo,
bravo when yo're playing.

1129
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:37,580
And on her birthday

1130
01:08:37,581 --> 01:08:39,715
I put ten dollars in
your clarinet case.

1131
01:08:39,716 --> 01:08:41,518
Greg! Hey, Greg.
Commando Greg. Greg!

1132
01:08:42,752 --> 01:08:43,720
You know you might
recognize me, too!

1133
01:08:45,189 --> 01:08:47,623
I was, I was the, I was in the
Dickies Nachos commercials.

1134
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:49,725
I knew your face
looked familiar!

1135
01:08:49,726 --> 01:08:51,227
He, h's the Royal Munch guy!

1136
01:08:51,228 --> 01:08:52,961
Exactly! Yeah!

1137
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:53,630
Yeah.

1138
01:08:54,498 --> 01:08:55,631
You know what else?

1139
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:56,665
Your face looks familiar to me.

1140
01:08:56,666 --> 01:08:57,301
Really?

1141
01:08:59,536 --> 01:09:01,238
I've seen you on TV.

1142
01:09:03,673 --> 01:09:04,641
Yes, I remember
your grandmother.

1143
01:09:07,611 --> 01:09:08,612
She's a lovely woman.

1144
01:09:12,416 --> 01:09:13,750
It was me at nursing home.

1145
01:09:16,386 --> 01:09:17,287
I told you.

1146
01:09:21,057 --> 01:09:21,891
I play there.

1147
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,362
Sometimes.

1148
01:09:28,865 --> 01:09:29,833
I also play...

1149
01:09:30,934 --> 01:09:31,901
At dance parties,

1150
01:09:33,703 --> 01:09:34,738
And funerals.

1151
01:09:42,746 --> 01:09:43,380
I lied to you.

1152
01:09:48,385 --> 01:09:49,786
I lied to you all along.

1153
01:09:52,722 --> 01:09:53,957
I, uh...

1154
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,293
I was let go

1155
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,363
from the orchestra
six months ago.

1156
01:10:05,001 --> 01:10:06,303
I failed.

1157
01:10:09,973 --> 01:10:10,974
I failed as a serious musician.

1158
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:20,917
I's all right. Please.
I'll be all right.

1159
01:10:25,922 --> 01:10:28,424
Dance parties, funerals.

1160
01:10:28,425 --> 01:10:29,993
Tha's exactly where the great
musicians belong, if you ask me.

1161
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,228
Dad...

1162
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:33,863
Who cares where you play?

1163
01:10:35,499 --> 01:10:36,766
You're awesome right
here on Fairfax.

1164
01:10:38,835 --> 01:10:39,369
Thank you son.

1165
01:10:41,204 --> 01:10:42,272
I have wonderful children.

1166
01:10:44,508 --> 01:10:45,675
You're a whore.

1167
01:10:47,411 --> 01:10:48,378
You're just a whore.

1168
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:54,884
Susan, wait!

1169
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:56,553
Nikita...

1170
01:10:59,188 --> 01:11:01,391
I'm sorry. I told you I
was great with faces.

1171
01:11:04,828 --> 01:11:05,462
Ah!

1172
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:06,896
What's going on?

1173
01:11:10,867 --> 01:11:11,701
Oh Shit!

1174
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:28,718
Everybody out now.
He needs to rest.

1175
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:34,491
Come on.

1176
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:37,794
He'll be fine.

1177
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:39,896
If he asks for some vodka...

1178
01:11:40,964 --> 01:11:41,798
give him a little.

1179
01:11:41,799 --> 01:11:42,865
Okay

1180
01:11:42,866 --> 01:11:43,433
Yes, with pickle.

1181
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:44,701
Yes with pickle

1182
01:11:47,404 --> 01:11:49,405
Bye

1183
01:11:49,406 --> 01:11:50,340
I, uh... Will be next door.

1184
01:12:09,693 --> 01:12:11,595
Could I exchange those
for a fifth of Smirnoff, please?

1185
01:12:12,862 --> 01:12:15,063
Nikita.

1186
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:18,634
Alcohol is the Achilles
heel of all Russian men.

1187
01:12:18,635 --> 01:12:20,636
Look at what happened
with your brother.

1188
01:12:20,637 --> 01:12:22,472
What do you mean?

1189
01:12:24,608 --> 01:12:26,410
Wait til you see what
Vera left in the VCR.

1190
01:12:29,212 --> 01:12:30,913
The suspects seen here
are still at large.

1191
01:12:30,914 --> 01:12:31,448
Hey!

1192
01:12:34,951 --> 01:12:35,919
Man, Greg was a lot
tougher than he looked.

1193
01:12:37,521 --> 01:12:38,488
Yeah, but you held
your own for awhile.

1194
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:40,457
Well, thank you, but I don't...

1195
01:12:41,758 --> 01:12:42,726
think I should have done that.

1196
01:12:44,494 --> 01:12:45,661
I like Greg. H's a nice guy.

1197
01:12:45,662 --> 01:12:47,530
Who am I kidding?

1198
01:12:47,531 --> 01:12:49,398
I could never move to Texas...

1199
01:12:49,399 --> 01:12:50,667
and marry Greg.

1200
01:12:57,173 --> 01:12:58,575
Hey, you okay?

1201
01:13:00,544 --> 01:13:01,678
No. I fell in love.

1202
01:13:03,747 --> 01:13:03,980
What?

1203
01:13:18,562 --> 01:13:19,563
Who's the lucky girl?

1204
01:13:27,103 --> 01:13:27,637
It's you.

1205
01:13:33,109 --> 01:13:35,011
Why are you
torturing me like this?

1206
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:39,448
You're my brother.

1207
01:13:39,449 --> 01:13:40,850
No, no, I am not
your damn brother.

1208
01:13:43,019 --> 01:13:44,052
What do you mean?

1209
01:13:44,053 --> 01:13:45,554
I'm not your brother.

1210
01:13:45,555 --> 01:13:47,456
My mother,

1211
01:13:47,457 --> 01:13:49,125
raised me in Tarzana. I don't
even know my da's name.

1212
01:13:51,127 --> 01:13:54,129
Lolita, just believe me. I lied.
But I lied to Max. I lied to Nikita.

1213
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:55,664
I am not related to you
or anybody in this family!

1214
01:13:55,665 --> 01:13:57,466
I have given...

1215
01:13:57,467 --> 01:13:59,635
my whole life

1216
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:00,937
to my children.

1217
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:05,441
And what do I get in return?

1218
01:14:06,543 --> 01:14:08,011
They both leave me.

1219
01:14:09,813 --> 01:14:10,647
You are all have
left of my soul.

1220
01:14:11,748 --> 01:14:14,583
You and your mother

1221
01:14:14,584 --> 01:14:15,151
We are off to the
airport. You and I.

1222
01:14:17,153 --> 01:14:18,554
We are going back to
Cincinnati to see Janice.

1223
01:14:18,555 --> 01:14:19,922
Ah, shit...

1224
01:14:19,923 --> 01:14:21,423
W'll pick up flowers
at the airport.

1225
01:14:21,424 --> 01:14:22,925
Daisies, lots of them!

1226
01:14:22,926 --> 01:14:24,093
She used to love daisies.

1227
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:27,497
Wha's so funny? Huh?

1228
01:14:31,267 --> 01:14:32,769
You think I's funny?

1229
01:14:33,402 --> 01:14:34,237
No.

1230
01:14:34,238 --> 01:14:35,303
Huh?

1231
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,039
No.

1232
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,108
I have raised some
heartless egoists.

1233
01:14:40,844 --> 01:14:42,145
I show you what your
fathe's made of!

1234
01:14:45,381 --> 01:14:48,383
All I need from this dump

1235
01:14:48,384 --> 01:14:50,385
is my clarinet!

1236
01:14:50,386 --> 01:14:52,688
My clarinet and my notes.

1237
01:14:52,689 --> 01:14:53,990
That is all what I need.

1238
01:14:57,226 --> 01:14:59,562
Nobody is carrying
me from here in a coffin!

1239
01:14:59,563 --> 01:15:00,930
Nobody!

1240
01:15:06,135 --> 01:15:07,469
How could you lie
to me like that?

1241
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:08,171
What else was I supposed to do?

1242
01:15:09,305 --> 01:15:10,139
I trusted you.

1243
01:15:10,139 --> 01:15:10,840
I know.

1244
01:15:11,641 --> 01:15:12,141
I opened up to you.

1245
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:14,744
I fucking French-kissed you.

1246
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:18,113
You're just...

1247
01:15:18,114 --> 01:15:18,982
a stranger.

1248
01:15:18,982 --> 01:15:19,616
But I's a good thing. I mean...

1249
01:15:21,551 --> 01:15:22,285
are't you actually relieved
that 'm not your brother?

1250
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,353
No.

1251
01:15:24,354 --> 01:15:25,621
No.

1252
01:15:25,622 --> 01:15:26,656
Yes.

1253
01:15:28,792 --> 01:15:30,659
I don't know,

1254
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:31,460
I'm gonna call the police

1255
01:15:31,461 --> 01:15:32,528
Oh, go ahead.

1256
01:15:34,964 --> 01:15:36,132
I'd rather be a convict
than be your brother

1257
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:40,804
And I just wish I could...

1258
01:16:06,763 --> 01:16:07,697
- Dad!
- Oh gee

1259
01:16:12,702 --> 01:16:13,036
I's not what you think.

1260
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:15,503
Oh god...

1261
01:16:15,504 --> 01:16:16,039
Please take a deep breath.

1262
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:17,907
What have I done?

1263
01:16:19,776 --> 01:16:21,144
B's not my brother. H's
just some hustler from Tarzana.

1264
01:16:22,278 --> 01:16:22,912
I's true.

1265
01:16:25,148 --> 01:16:26,683
He, h's a car thief. Him
and Skip. I called the police.

1266
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:29,152
I lied to you, Max.
I'm not your son.

1267
01:16:31,187 --> 01:16:32,587
I'm sorry. But the
police were chasing...

1268
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:33,923
I need to see Janice.

1269
01:16:36,392 --> 01:16:38,061
My mother's nam's
not Janice, Max.

1270
01:16:39,162 --> 01:16:40,063

She's not a cellist.

1272
01:16:42,999 --> 01:16:44,100
She's a flight attendant
for Hibichi Air.

1273
01:16:46,135 --> 01:16:47,003
And I'm not your son, Dad...

1274
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:51,908
But I love you like the
father I never had.

1275
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,315
And you...

1276
01:17:00,316 --> 01:17:01,951
my God, I love seeing
your face so much.

1277
01:17:02,919 --> 01:17:03,853

01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:16,965
Perfect.

1282
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:18,267
I fell in love with a felon.

1283
01:17:20,269 --> 01:17:21,170
How Russian of me.

1284
01:17:22,739 --> 01:17:23,773
Will you marry me?

1285
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:27,943
Pretty crazy timing.

1286
01:17:27,944 --> 01:17:29,345
Well, you said to live
in the moment, so...

1287
01:17:30,947 --> 01:17:31,715
I'm about to go to
prison. I had to ask.

1288
01:17:33,549 --> 01:17:34,784
You son of a bitch.

1289
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:43,059
I guess I really deserved that.

1290
01:17:49,365 --> 01:17:51,735
You have beautiful eyes,
you know that?

1291
01:17:53,436 --> 01:17:54,971
You too, Boris Maximovich.
