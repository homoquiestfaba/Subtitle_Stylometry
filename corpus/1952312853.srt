1
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:15,937
That's nice.
Thank you.

2
00:00:16,014 --> 00:00:19,675
Thanks very much,
I appreciate it.

3
00:00:24,313 --> 00:00:25,405
Thank you very much.

4
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:26,539
Thank you all.

5
00:00:26,615 --> 00:00:27,910
Thank you.

6
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:29,446
I appreciate that.

7
00:00:29,514 --> 00:00:30,480
Thank you.

8
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:31,808
Thank you.

9
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:33,870
So let me ask
you something.

10
00:00:33,948 --> 00:00:35,845
Let me ask you how's
everybody doing tonight

11
00:00:35,913 --> 00:00:37,742
huh?

12
00:00:41,515 --> 00:00:42,443
Good.

13
00:00:42,512 --> 00:00:45,637
Well fuck you.

14
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:49,270
Just trying to make
you feel at home.

15
00:00:49,346 --> 00:00:52,313
Now listen, I've been
out here all this time

16
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:53,812
and I haven't
been complaining

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,141
about anything yet

18
00:00:55,214 --> 00:00:56,010
so I think it's time

19
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:58,911
to go into the
complaint department.

20
00:00:58,981 --> 00:01:01,206
This is just a
series of things

21
00:01:01,278 --> 00:01:04,337
that are pissing
me off okay?

22
00:01:04,414 --> 00:01:06,902
A series of things that
are pissing me off

23
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:08,969
cause I don't
have pet peeves

24
00:01:09,047 --> 00:01:14,104
I have major psychotic
fucking hatreds okay?

25
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:16,611
And it makes the world a
lot easier to sort out.

26
00:01:17,414 --> 00:01:19,002
First thing on
my list tonight,

27
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:20,669
airport security.

28
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:21,870
Tired of this shit.

29
00:01:21,945 --> 00:01:23,172
There's too much of it.

30
00:01:23,245 --> 00:01:25,371
There's too much
security at the airport.

31
00:01:25,446 --> 00:01:28,071
I'm tired of some guy
with a double digit IQ

32
00:01:28,146 --> 00:01:29,736
and a triple digit income

33
00:01:29,812 --> 00:01:32,438
rooting around inside
of my bag for no reason

34
00:01:32,513 --> 00:01:34,637
and never
finding anything.

35
00:01:34,712 --> 00:01:36,145
Haven't found
anything yet.

36
00:01:36,214 --> 00:01:39,144
Haven't found one
bomb in one bag

37
00:01:39,212 --> 00:01:40,201
and don't tell me,

38
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:41,505
Well the
terrorist know

39
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:42,977
there bags are
going to be searched

40
00:01:43,046 --> 00:01:44,533
so now they're leaving
their bombs at home.

41
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:46,101
There are no bombs.

42
00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:49,269
The whole thing is
fucking pointless

43
00:01:49,345 --> 00:01:52,071
and it's completely
without logic.

44
00:01:52,144 --> 00:01:53,406
There's no logic at all.

45
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,875
They'll take away gun
but let you keep a knife.

46
00:01:55,944 --> 00:01:58,275
Well what the
fuck is that?

47
00:01:58,345 --> 00:02:01,402
In fact there's a whole
list of lethal objects

48
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:03,636
they will allow you
to take on board.

49
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,803
Theoretically you
could take a knife,

50
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,241
an ice pick,
a hatchet,

51
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:08,572
a straight razor,
a pair of scissors,

52
00:02:08,644 --> 00:02:10,043
a chainsaw, six
knitting needles

53
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:11,668
and a broken
whiskey bottle

54
00:02:11,745 --> 00:02:13,372
and the only thing they're
going to say to you

55
00:02:13,446 --> 00:02:14,909
is that bag has to fit

56
00:02:14,977 --> 00:02:18,206
all the way under the
seat in front of you.

57
00:02:18,278 --> 00:02:21,936
And if you didn't take
a weapon on board relax,

58
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:23,738
after you been flying
for about an hour

59
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,503
they're going to bring
you a knife and fork.

60
00:02:27,577 --> 00:02:30,976
They actually give
you a fucking knife.

61
00:02:31,045 --> 00:02:32,534
It's only a table knife

62
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:35,632
but you could kill a
pilot with a table knife.

63
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:38,472
Might take you a couple
of minutes you know,

64
00:02:38,544 --> 00:02:41,031
especially if
he's hefty huh?

65
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,168
Yeah but you could
get the job done

66
00:02:43,244 --> 00:02:46,142
if you really wanted
to kill the prick.

67
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:47,905
Shit there's a lot of
things you could use

68
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:49,273
to kill a guy with.

69
00:02:49,344 --> 00:02:51,069
You could probably beat
a guy to death with the

70
00:02:51,142 --> 00:02:53,905
Sunday New York
Times couldn't you?

71
00:02:53,977 --> 00:02:57,636
Or suppose you just
had really big hands

72
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,767
couldn't you strangle
a flight attendant?

73
00:02:59,844 --> 00:03:01,503
Shit you could probably
strangle two of them,

74
00:03:01,577 --> 00:03:03,133
one with each hand.

75
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,903
You know if you are lucky
enough to catch them

76
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,942
in that little
kitchen area

77
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,804
before they give out the
fucking peanuts you know?

78
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,774
But you could
get the job done

79
00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:14,502
if you really
cared enough.

80
00:03:14,576 --> 00:03:16,509
So why is it
they allow a man

81
00:03:16,577 --> 00:03:18,007
with big powerful hands

82
00:03:18,075 --> 00:03:20,167
to get on board
an airplane?

83
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:21,538
I'll tell you why.

84
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:23,473
They know he's not
a security risk

85
00:03:23,543 --> 00:03:25,007
because he's
already answered

86
00:03:25,075 --> 00:03:28,234
the three big
questions.

87
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,740
Question number one:

88
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:32,673
Did you pack your
bags yourself?

89
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:39,634
No Carrot Top
packed my bags.

90
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,766
He and Martha Stewart
and Florence Henderson

91
00:03:44,843 --> 00:03:46,932
came over to the
house last night,

92
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:49,237
fixed me a lovely
lobster Newburgh,

93
00:03:49,309 --> 00:03:51,069
gave me a full
body massage

94
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:53,005
with sacred oils
from India,

95
00:03:53,075 --> 00:03:55,097
performed a four
way around the world

96
00:03:55,174 --> 00:03:57,935
and then they
packed my bags.

97
00:03:58,008 --> 00:04:00,475
Next question:

98
00:04:06,774 --> 00:04:07,900
Have your bags

99
00:04:07,975 --> 00:04:10,100
been in your possession
the whole time?

100
00:04:10,174 --> 00:04:12,003
No.

101
00:04:12,074 --> 00:04:13,973
Usually the night
before I travel,

102
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:16,802
just as the
moon is rising,

103
00:04:16,874 --> 00:04:18,772
I place my suitcases
out on the street corner

104
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:19,931
and leave them there

105
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:22,736
unattended for
several hours.

106
00:04:22,808 --> 00:04:25,602
Just for good luck.

107
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:28,401
Next question:

108
00:04:28,474 --> 00:04:30,031
Has any
unknown person

109
00:04:30,108 --> 00:04:32,596
asked you to take
anything on board?

110
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:34,504
Hmm,

111
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,973
but what exactly is
an unknown person?

112
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:41,304
Surely everyone is
known to someone.

113
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,998
In fact, just
this morning

114
00:04:43,072 --> 00:04:47,096
Kareem and Ucef
Allibamgaba

115
00:04:47,173 --> 00:04:49,661
seemed to know each
other quite well.

116
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,139
They kept joking about

117
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:54,604
which one of my suitcases
was the heaviest.

118
00:04:54,673 --> 00:04:57,138
And that's another thing they
don't like at the airport,

119
00:04:57,206 --> 00:04:58,901
jokes you know?

120
00:04:58,974 --> 00:05:01,563
Yeah you can't
joke about a bomb.

121
00:05:01,638 --> 00:05:03,299
Well why is it just jokes?

122
00:05:03,374 --> 00:05:06,862
What about a riddle?

123
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,905
How about a limerick?

124
00:05:08,972 --> 00:05:11,836
How about a
bomb anecdote?

125
00:05:11,905 --> 00:05:16,031
You know no punch line
just a really cute story.

126
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:18,097
Or suppose you
intended the remark

127
00:05:18,174 --> 00:05:21,036
not as a joke but
as an ironic musing.

128
00:05:21,106 --> 00:05:23,039
Are they prepared to
make that distinction?

129
00:05:23,107 --> 00:05:25,901
Why I think not.

130
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:28,437
And besides who's
to say what's funny.

131
00:05:28,505 --> 00:05:30,630
Airport security
is a stupid idea,

132
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,106
it's a waste of money

133
00:05:32,106 --> 00:05:33,730
and it's only there
for one reason,

134
00:05:33,804 --> 00:05:36,601
to make white
people feel safe.

135
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:38,933
That's all, the illusion,

136
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,937
the feeling and
illusion of safety

137
00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:43,302
cause the
authorities know

138
00:05:43,373 --> 00:05:45,304
they can't make an
airplane completely safe.

139
00:05:45,372 --> 00:05:47,134
Too many people
have access.

140
00:05:47,206 --> 00:05:48,693
You'll notice the
drug smugglers

141
00:05:48,771 --> 00:05:50,135
don't seem to have
a lot of trouble

142
00:05:50,205 --> 00:05:52,502
getting there little
packages on board do they?

143
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:57,196
No and God bless them too.

144
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:03,061
Oh and by the way

145
00:06:03,138 --> 00:06:06,036
an airplane flight shouldn't
be completely safe.

146
00:06:06,105 --> 00:06:08,094
You need a little
danger in your life.

147
00:06:08,171 --> 00:06:11,159
Take a fucking chance
once in a while will you?

148
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,397
What are you going to do

149
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:15,436
play with your prick for
another thirty years?

150
00:06:15,503 --> 00:06:17,095
What are you going to
read People Magazine

151
00:06:17,171 --> 00:06:20,331
and eat at Wendy's
till the end of time?

152
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:22,029
Take a fucking chance.

153
00:06:22,104 --> 00:06:23,764
Besides even if
they made

154
00:06:23,838 --> 00:06:25,769
all of the airplanes
completely safe

155
00:06:25,837 --> 00:06:27,201
the terrorist
would simply

156
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,703
start bombing other
places that are crowded.

157
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:30,498
Porn shops,

158
00:06:30,571 --> 00:06:31,333
crack houses,

159
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:32,428
titty bars

160
00:06:32,505 --> 00:06:34,901
and gangbangs you know?

161
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,368
Entertainment venues.

162
00:06:37,437 --> 00:06:39,403
The odds of you being
killed by a terrorist

163
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:41,937
are practically zero.

164
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:44,799
So I say relax and
enjoy the show.

165
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,199
You have to be a realist.

166
00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:48,360
You have to be realistic
about terrorism.

167
00:06:48,436 --> 00:06:50,699
Certain groups of
people, certain groups,

168
00:06:50,771 --> 00:06:51,928
Muslim Fundamentalist,

169
00:06:52,002 --> 00:06:53,128
Christian
Fundamentalist,

170
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:54,566
Jewish Fundamentalist

171
00:06:54,635 --> 00:06:58,693
and just plain
guys from Montana

172
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:00,702
are going to continue to
make life in this country

173
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,929
very interesting for
a long, long time.

174
00:07:04,003 --> 00:07:05,334
That's the reality.

175
00:07:05,404 --> 00:07:07,198
Angry men in
combat fatigues

176
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:09,498
talking to God on
a two-way radio

177
00:07:09,571 --> 00:07:12,127
and mothering incoherent
slogans about freedom

178
00:07:12,203 --> 00:07:13,635
are eventually
going to provide us

179
00:07:13,703 --> 00:07:16,498
with a great deal
of entertainment.

180
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,262
Especially after your
stupid, fucking economy

181
00:07:19,335 --> 00:07:21,733
collapses all around you

182
00:07:21,802 --> 00:07:23,427
and the terrorist come
out of the woodwork

183
00:07:23,502 --> 00:07:24,694
and you'll have anthrax

184
00:07:24,768 --> 00:07:26,030
in your water supply

185
00:07:26,103 --> 00:07:27,467
and serine gas in
your air conditioners.

186
00:07:27,536 --> 00:07:28,864
They'll be chemical
and biological

187
00:07:28,934 --> 00:07:30,424
suitcase bombs
in every city

188
00:07:30,502 --> 00:07:31,762
and I say enjoy it,

189
00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:33,233
relax. Enjoy the show.

190
00:07:33,302 --> 00:07:34,598
Take a fucking chance.

191
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:36,066
Put a little fun
in your life.

192
00:07:36,135 --> 00:07:37,897
To me terrorism
is exciting.

193
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:39,162
It's exciting.

194
00:07:39,236 --> 00:07:41,201
I think the very
idea that you can

195
00:07:41,268 --> 00:07:42,792
set off a bomb
in a marketplace

196
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,300
and kill several
hundred people

197
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:45,734
is exciting and
stimulating

198
00:07:45,803 --> 00:07:48,892
and I see it as a
form of entertainment.

199
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,526
Entertainment
that's all it is.

200
00:07:53,435 --> 00:07:54,798
Yeah.

201
00:07:56,534 --> 00:07:59,023
But... but I also know
that most Americans

202
00:07:59,101 --> 00:08:01,566
are soft and frightened
and unimaginative

203
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:03,294
and they don't realize
there's such a thing

204
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:05,165
as dangerous fun

205
00:08:05,236 --> 00:08:06,722
and they certainly
don't recognize

206
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,390
a good show when
they see one.

207
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:09,956
I have always
been willing

208
00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:11,728
to put myself at
great personal risk

209
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:13,390
for the sake of
entertainment.

210
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:14,991
And I've always been
willing to put you

211
00:08:15,068 --> 00:08:17,329
at great personal risk
for the same reason.

212
00:08:17,401 --> 00:08:18,799
As far as I'm concerned

213
00:08:18,868 --> 00:08:20,334
all of this
airport security,

214
00:08:20,402 --> 00:08:22,027
all the searches,
the screenings,

215
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,500
the cameras, the questions

216
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:24,896
it's just one more way

217
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:27,298
of reducing your liberty
and reminding you

218
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:30,800
that they can fuck with
you anytime they want

219
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:32,891
as long as you
put up with it.

220
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:34,729
As long as you
put up with it,

221
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:37,595
which means of course
anytime they want

222
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:39,189
cause that's what
Americans do now.

223
00:08:39,266 --> 00:08:40,893
Their always willing
to trade away

224
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:42,488
a little of their freedom

225
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:43,930
in exchange for
the feeling,

226
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,295
the illusion of security.

227
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:47,560
What we have now

228
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:50,098
is a completely
neurotic population

229
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,724
obsessed with
security and safety

230
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,822
and crime and drugs
and cleanliness

231
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:56,730
and hygiene and germs.

232
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:59,292
There's another
thing, germs.

233
00:08:59,368 --> 00:09:01,264
Where did this
sudden fear of germs

234
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,958
come from in this country?

235
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:04,499
Had you noticed this,

236
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:06,032
the media constantly
running stories

237
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,656
about all the
latest infections,

238
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:11,097
salmonella, ecoli,
hanka virus, bird flu

239
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,256
and Americans
panic easily

240
00:09:13,332 --> 00:09:14,764
so now everybody's
running around

241
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,355
scrubbing this
and spraying that

242
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:17,626
and overcooking
their food

243
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,064
and repeatedly
washing their hands

244
00:09:19,134 --> 00:09:21,792
trying to avoid all
contact with germs.

245
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:23,194
It's ridiculous

246
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:25,232
and it goes to
ridiculous lengths.

247
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,458
In prisons

248
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,430
before they give you
a lethal injection

249
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:32,693
they swab your
arm with alcohol.

250
00:09:32,766 --> 00:09:34,323
It's true.

251
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,127
It's true.

252
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,925
It's true.

253
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:44,729
Well they don't want
you to get an infection

254
00:09:44,798 --> 00:09:46,025
and you can see
their point.

255
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:47,724
Wouldn't want some
guy to go to hell

256
00:09:47,798 --> 00:09:49,957
and be sick.

257
00:09:50,031 --> 00:09:51,691
Would take a lot of
the sportsmanship

258
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:53,697
out of the whole
execution.

259
00:09:53,765 --> 00:09:58,459
Fear of, germs why
these fucking pussies.

260
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,156
You can't even get a
decent hamburger anymore.

261
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:02,754
They kick the shit
out of everything now

262
00:10:02,832 --> 00:10:05,491
cause everybody's afraid
of food poisoning.

263
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:07,156
Hey where's your
sense of adventure?

264
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,288
Take a fucking
chance will ya?

265
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:10,593
Do you know how
many people

266
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,995
die in this country from
food poisoning every year?

267
00:10:13,065 --> 00:10:14,622
Nine thousand,
that's all,

268
00:10:14,696 --> 00:10:17,926
it's a minor risk.

269
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:22,760
Take a fucking chance
bunch Goddamn pussies.

270
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,421
Besides what do you think

271
00:10:24,497 --> 00:10:26,429
you have an
immune system for?

272
00:10:26,497 --> 00:10:29,758
It's for killing germs
but it needs practice.

273
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,559
It needs germs
to practice on

274
00:10:34,596 --> 00:10:36,323
so... so listen.

275
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,154
So listen.

276
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,388
If you kill all the
germs around you

277
00:10:41,463 --> 00:10:43,328
and live a completely
sterile life

278
00:10:43,398 --> 00:10:44,726
then when germs
do come along

279
00:10:44,796 --> 00:10:46,353
you're not going
to be prepared.

280
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,953
And never mind
ordinary germs

281
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:49,394
what are you going to do

282
00:10:49,464 --> 00:10:50,897
when some super
virus comes along

283
00:10:50,965 --> 00:10:52,360
that turns your
vital organs

284
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:54,396
into liquid shit?

285
00:10:54,464 --> 00:10:55,623
I'll tell you what
you're going to do,

286
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:56,685
you're going to sick,

287
00:10:56,763 --> 00:10:57,752
you're going to die

288
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,887
and you're going
to deserve it

289
00:10:58,963 --> 00:11:00,156
cause you're
fucking weak

290
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,786
and you got a fucking
weak immune system.

291
00:11:01,863 --> 00:11:03,590
Now.

292
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,457
Goddamn it.

293
00:11:06,528 --> 00:11:08,621
Hey.

294
00:11:08,697 --> 00:11:10,422
All right.

295
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:12,086
Let me you tell
you a true story

296
00:11:12,162 --> 00:11:13,854
about immunization okay?

297
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:15,725
When I was a little
boy in New York City

298
00:11:15,796 --> 00:11:18,920
in the 1940's we swam
in the Hudson River

299
00:11:18,996 --> 00:11:22,224
and it was filled
with raw sewage okay?

300
00:11:22,296 --> 00:11:25,229
We swam in raw
sewage you know,

301
00:11:25,297 --> 00:11:27,889
to cool off

302
00:11:27,964 --> 00:11:30,189
and at that time the
big fear was polio.

303
00:11:30,261 --> 00:11:32,524
Thousands of kids died
from polio every year

304
00:11:32,596 --> 00:11:33,653
but you know something?

305
00:11:33,729 --> 00:11:35,695
In my neighborhood no
one ever got polio,

306
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:37,058
no one, ever.

307
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,253
You know why?

308
00:11:38,328 --> 00:11:41,192
Cause we swam
in raw sewage.

309
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:43,624
It strengthened
our immune systems.

310
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:45,218
The polio never
had a prayer.

311
00:11:45,296 --> 00:11:50,988
We were tempered
in raw shit.

312
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,857
So... so personally
I never take

313
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:55,019
any special precautions
against germs.

314
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:56,391
I don't shy
away from people

315
00:11:56,462 --> 00:11:57,792
who sneeze and cough.

316
00:11:57,862 --> 00:11:59,122
I don't wipe off
the telephone.

317
00:11:59,195 --> 00:12:00,559
I don't cover
the toilet seat

318
00:12:00,628 --> 00:12:01,958
and if I drop
food on the floor

319
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:03,961
I pick it
up and eat it.

320
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:05,856
I eat it.

321
00:12:05,927 --> 00:12:08,986
Yes I do.

322
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,993
Even if I'm at
a sidewalk café

323
00:12:12,061 --> 00:12:14,289
in Calcutta,

324
00:12:14,362 --> 00:12:16,191
the poor section

325
00:12:16,261 --> 00:12:20,056
on New Years morning
during a soccer riot.

326
00:12:20,127 --> 00:12:21,787
And you know something
in spite of all that

327
00:12:21,861 --> 00:12:23,293
so called risky behavior

328
00:12:23,362 --> 00:12:24,519
I never get infections.

329
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:25,559
I don't get them.

330
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:26,558
I don't get colds.

331
00:12:26,627 --> 00:12:27,557
I don't get flu.

332
00:12:27,626 --> 00:12:28,523
I don't get headaches.

333
00:12:28,593 --> 00:12:29,651
I don't get upset stomach.

334
00:12:29,728 --> 00:12:30,887
And you know why?

335
00:12:30,961 --> 00:12:32,255
Cause I got a good
strong immune system

336
00:12:32,326 --> 00:12:33,623
and it gets a
lot of practice.

337
00:12:33,694 --> 00:12:35,126
My immune system
is equipped

338
00:12:35,194 --> 00:12:36,659
with the biologically
equivalent

339
00:12:36,727 --> 00:12:38,887
of fully automatic
military assault rifles

340
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:41,427
with night vision
and laser scopes

341
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:42,719
and we have
recently acquired

342
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:44,884
phosphorus grenades,
cluster bombs

343
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,892
and anti-personnel
fragmentation mines.

344
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,892
So when my white blood
cells are on patrol

345
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,425
Keeping order in
my bloodstream

346
00:12:52,493 --> 00:12:54,391
seeking out strangers
and other undesirables,

347
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,858
if they see any,

348
00:12:55,926 --> 00:12:57,687
any suspicious looking
germs of any kind

349
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:00,158
they don't fuck around.

350
00:13:00,227 --> 00:13:01,656
They whip out the weapons,

351
00:13:01,725 --> 00:13:02,987
they wax the motherfucker

352
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:04,388
and deposit the
unlucky fellow

353
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:07,449
directly into my colon.

354
00:13:07,526 --> 00:13:09,821
Into my colon,
there's no nonsense.

355
00:13:09,892 --> 00:13:11,120
There's no
Miranda warning.

356
00:13:11,194 --> 00:13:12,351
There's none of that

357
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,857
three strikes and
your out shit.

358
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:18,916
First offense bam
into the colon you go.

359
00:13:18,994 --> 00:13:20,185
Yeah.

360
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,452
Good.

361
00:13:22,526 --> 00:13:23,549
Yeah.

362
00:13:23,626 --> 00:13:25,455
All right.

363
00:13:25,526 --> 00:13:30,822
Oh, and speaking
of my colon

364
00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:32,058
I want you to know

365
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:33,717
I don't automatically
wash my hands

366
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,281
every time I go to
the bathroom okay?

367
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,222
Can you deal with that?

368
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,722
Sometimes I do,
sometimes I don't.

369
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,155
You know when
I was my hands?

370
00:13:43,225 --> 00:13:46,554
When I shit on them.

371
00:13:46,624 --> 00:13:48,682
That's the only time.

372
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:49,781
That's the only...

373
00:13:49,858 --> 00:13:51,085
and you know how
often that happens?

374
00:13:51,158 --> 00:13:54,989
Tops... tops two, three
times a week, tops.

375
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:56,150
Tops.

376
00:13:56,226 --> 00:13:57,621
Maybe a little
more frequently

377
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:00,419
over the holidays,
you know what I mean?

378
00:14:00,492 --> 00:14:02,082
And I'll tell you
something else

379
00:14:02,158 --> 00:14:04,248
my well-scrubbed
friends.

380
00:14:04,324 --> 00:14:06,290
You don't always need
a shower everyday.

381
00:14:06,358 --> 00:14:07,416
Did you know that?

382
00:14:07,492 --> 00:14:08,650
It's overkill.

383
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:10,384
Unless you work out
or work outdoors

384
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,583
or for some reason come
in intimate contact

385
00:14:12,658 --> 00:14:14,022
with huge
amounts of filth

386
00:14:14,092 --> 00:14:15,556
and garbage everyday

387
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:17,089
you don't always
need a shower.

388
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:18,452
All you really need to do

389
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:21,422
is to wash the
four key areas,

390
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:24,924
armpits, asshole,
crotch and teeth.

391
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:25,923
Got that?

392
00:14:25,992 --> 00:14:29,152
Armpits, asshole,
crotch and teeth.

393
00:14:29,225 --> 00:14:31,053
In fact you can
save yourself

394
00:14:31,124 --> 00:14:32,284
a whole lot of time

395
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:34,118
if you simply use
the same brush

396
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:37,351
on all four areas.

397
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,446
Thank you.

398
00:14:44,224 --> 00:14:45,553
Thank you.

399
00:14:46,256 --> 00:14:48,017
I appreciate
it. Thank you.

400
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,482
All right.

401
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:52,522
Listen I got a
few more items

402
00:14:52,588 --> 00:14:54,556
of things that are
pissing me off

403
00:14:54,623 --> 00:14:57,589
and this one comes in
the form of a question.

404
00:14:57,657 --> 00:14:59,021
Haven't we had
about enough

405
00:14:59,091 --> 00:15:02,114
of this cigar smoking
shit in this country?

406
00:15:02,191 --> 00:15:03,246
Huh?

407
00:15:03,322 --> 00:15:05,721
Huh?

408
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,584
When is this going to end?

409
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,385
When is this shit
going to go away?

410
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,614
When are these fat,
arrogant, overpaid,

411
00:15:11,688 --> 00:15:12,848
overfed, over privileged,

412
00:15:12,923 --> 00:15:14,321
over indulged,
white collar,

413
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,617
business criminal,
asshole, cocksuckers

414
00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:20,382
going to put
out their cigars

415
00:15:20,456 --> 00:15:23,650
and move along to their
next abomination?

416
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,711
White pussy businessmen

417
00:15:25,788 --> 00:15:29,844
sucking on a
big brown dick.

418
00:15:29,921 --> 00:15:32,183
That's all it is.

419
00:15:32,254 --> 00:15:33,618
That's all it is.

420
00:15:33,688 --> 00:15:36,654
Yeah.

421
00:15:36,722 --> 00:15:39,917
A big brown dick.

422
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:41,318
Sigmund Freud said,

423
00:15:41,388 --> 00:15:43,379
"Sometimes a cigar
is just a cigar."

424
00:15:43,457 --> 00:15:48,819
Oh yeah, well sometimes
it's a big brown dick...

425
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:50,582
with a fat, arrogant,
white-collar

426
00:15:50,656 --> 00:15:52,121
business
criminal, asshole

427
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:55,552
sucking on the
wet end of it.

428
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,213
But hey, the news is
not all bad for me,

429
00:15:58,289 --> 00:15:59,618
not all bad,

430
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:00,948
you want to know
the good part?

431
00:16:01,021 --> 00:16:02,611
Cancer of the mouth.

432
00:16:02,687 --> 00:16:03,619
Good.

433
00:16:03,688 --> 00:16:05,120
Fuck 'em.

434
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:06,346
Makes me happy.

435
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,647
It's an attractive
disease,

436
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:11,552
goes nice with
a cell phone.

437
00:16:11,621 --> 00:16:12,712
So light up.

438
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:14,650
Suspend a man and
suck that smoke

439
00:16:14,721 --> 00:16:16,483
deep down into
your empty suit

440
00:16:16,555 --> 00:16:17,918
and blow it
out your ass

441
00:16:17,988 --> 00:16:22,478
you fucking cocksucker.

442
00:16:22,555 --> 00:16:23,748
Thank you.

443
00:16:23,822 --> 00:16:26,116
Thank you.

444
00:16:26,187 --> 00:16:27,916
Hey,

445
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:32,815
here's another question
I've been pondering.

446
00:16:32,887 --> 00:16:35,319
What is all this
shit about angels?

447
00:16:35,388 --> 00:16:36,546
Have you heard this?

448
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,210
Yeah, three out
of four people

449
00:16:38,287 --> 00:16:40,617
now believe in angels.

450
00:16:40,687 --> 00:16:44,948
What are you
fucking stupid?

451
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,951
Has everybody lost
their fucking mind

452
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:48,680
in this country?

453
00:16:48,754 --> 00:16:49,845
Angels, shit.

454
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:51,010
You know what
I think it is?

455
00:16:51,086 --> 00:16:52,917
I think it's a
massive collective

456
00:16:52,988 --> 00:16:55,044
psychotic chemical
flashback

457
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,280
of all the drugs,

458
00:16:57,355 --> 00:16:58,785
all the drugs,

459
00:16:58,853 --> 00:17:00,480
smoked, swallowed,
snorted, shot

460
00:17:00,555 --> 00:17:02,950
and absorbed rectally

461
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:06,384
by all Americans
from 1960 to 1990.

462
00:17:06,453 --> 00:17:08,646
Thirty years of
adulterated street drugs

463
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:12,675
will get you some
fucking angels my friend.

464
00:17:12,753 --> 00:17:13,979
Angels shit.

465
00:17:14,052 --> 00:17:15,608
What about goblins huh?

466
00:17:15,685 --> 00:17:17,618
Doesn't anybody
believe in goblins?

467
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:19,778
Never hear about them
except on Halloween

468
00:17:19,851 --> 00:17:22,614
and its always negative
shit too you know?

469
00:17:22,686 --> 00:17:27,310
And zombies, where the
fuck are all the zombies?

470
00:17:27,385 --> 00:17:28,646
That's the trouble
with zombies,

471
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:31,378
they're unreliable.

472
00:17:31,452 --> 00:17:33,351
I say if you're going
to buy the angels shit

473
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,612
you might as well go

474
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,584
for the zombie
package as well.

475
00:17:37,387 --> 00:17:40,647
Here's another
horrifying example,

476
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:43,151
aspect of
American culture,

477
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:44,707
the pussification,

478
00:17:44,785 --> 00:17:46,080
the continued,

479
00:17:46,151 --> 00:17:48,276
the continued
pussification

480
00:17:48,352 --> 00:17:50,545
of the American male

481
00:17:50,617 --> 00:17:53,174
in the form...

482
00:17:55,353 --> 00:17:58,545
yeah all right,

483
00:17:58,617 --> 00:18:00,105
in the form of

484
00:18:00,184 --> 00:18:03,481
Harley Davidson
theme restaurants.

485
00:18:03,552 --> 00:18:06,575
What the fuck is
going on here?

486
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,515
Harley Davidson used
to mean something.

487
00:18:09,584 --> 00:18:11,915
It stood for
biker attitude.

488
00:18:11,986 --> 00:18:14,509
Grimy outlaws and
there sweaty mamas,

489
00:18:14,586 --> 00:18:16,515
full of beer and crank

490
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,141
rolling around
on Harley's

491
00:18:18,218 --> 00:18:19,911
looking for a good time

492
00:18:19,985 --> 00:18:21,042
destroying property,

493
00:18:21,118 --> 00:18:25,550
raping teenagers and
killing policemen.

494
00:18:25,617 --> 00:18:29,208
All very necessary
activities by the way

495
00:18:29,284 --> 00:18:31,614
but now theme
restaurants

496
00:18:31,684 --> 00:18:33,207
and this soft shit

497
00:18:33,285 --> 00:18:35,306
obviously didn't come
from hardcore bikers.

498
00:18:35,383 --> 00:18:37,905
It came from these
weekend motorcyclists.

499
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,143
These fraudulent,

500
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:40,706
two day a week
motherfuckers

501
00:18:40,784 --> 00:18:42,214
who have their bikes

502
00:18:42,283 --> 00:18:43,910
trucked into
Sturgis, South Dakota

503
00:18:43,985 --> 00:18:46,176
for the big rally
and then ride around

504
00:18:46,249 --> 00:18:48,217
like they just come
in off the road.

505
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:49,579
Dentist and bureaucrats

506
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,776
and pussy boy
software designers

507
00:18:51,851 --> 00:18:53,940
getting up on a Harley

508
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:55,643
cause they think
it makes them cool.

509
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,183
Well hey Skeezits
you ain't cool,

510
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,738
you're fucking chilly.

511
00:19:00,817 --> 00:19:02,715
And chilly ain't
never been cool.

512
00:19:04,116 --> 00:19:05,480
And here as long
as were talking

513
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,776
about theme restaurants,

514
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:07,974
I got a proposition
for you,

515
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:09,948
I think if white people

516
00:19:10,017 --> 00:19:12,277
are going to burn
down black churches

517
00:19:12,349 --> 00:19:13,475
then black people

518
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,175
ought to burn down the
House Of Blues huh?

519
00:19:16,249 --> 00:19:19,840
What a fucking disgrace
that place is,

520
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,110
the House Of Blues.

521
00:19:21,183 --> 00:19:22,273
They ought to call it

522
00:19:22,349 --> 00:19:25,578
the house of lame
white motherfuckers.

523
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,446
Inauthentic, low
frequency, single digit

524
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:30,446
lame white motherfuckers,

525
00:19:30,514 --> 00:19:32,573
especially these
male movie stars

526
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,808
who think they're
blues artist.

527
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,006
You ever see these guys?

528
00:19:36,082 --> 00:19:37,708
Don't you just want
to puke in your soup

529
00:19:37,782 --> 00:19:39,748
when one of these fat,
balding, overweight,

530
00:19:39,816 --> 00:19:41,179
over aged, out of shape,

531
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:42,645
middle-aged
male movie stars

532
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,146
with sunglasses
jumps on stage

533
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:46,114
and starts blowing
into a harmonica.

534
00:19:46,183 --> 00:19:49,147
It's a fucking sacrilege.

535
00:19:49,214 --> 00:19:50,613
In the first place,

536
00:19:50,682 --> 00:19:51,941
in the first place,

537
00:19:52,014 --> 00:19:53,481
white people
got no business

538
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:56,514
playing the blues
ever at all,

539
00:19:56,581 --> 00:19:58,548
under any
circumstances.

540
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:01,445
Ever, ever, ever.

541
00:20:01,515 --> 00:20:03,104
What the fuck
do white people

542
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:05,240
have to be blue about?

543
00:20:05,316 --> 00:20:11,611
Banana Republic
ran out of khakis?

544
00:20:11,681 --> 00:20:12,976
Huh?

545
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:16,377
The Espresso
machine is jammed.

546
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:20,345
Hootie and the Blowfish
are breaking up?

547
00:20:20,413 --> 00:20:22,107
Shit white people
ought to understand

548
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:24,580
there job is to give
people the blues

549
00:20:24,646 --> 00:20:26,840
not to get them.

550
00:20:26,914 --> 00:20:29,505
And certainly not to
sing or play them.

551
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,046
Tell you a little
secret about the blues;

552
00:20:31,114 --> 00:20:33,238
it's not enough to know
which notes to play

553
00:20:33,313 --> 00:20:36,108
you got to know why
they need to be played.

554
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,238
And another thing,
I don't think,

555
00:20:38,314 --> 00:20:39,837
I don't think
white people

556
00:20:39,915 --> 00:20:42,245
should be trying to
dance like blacks.

557
00:20:42,315 --> 00:20:45,040
Stop that!

558
00:20:45,113 --> 00:20:49,409
Stick to your faggoty
polkas and waltzes.

559
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,207
And that repulsive

560
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,405
country line dancing
shit that you do

561
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,775
and be yourself.

562
00:20:55,846 --> 00:20:57,334
Be proud, be
white, be lame

563
00:20:57,412 --> 00:21:00,039
and get the fuck
off the dance floor.

564
00:21:01,778 --> 00:21:05,608
Now.

565
00:21:05,678 --> 00:21:06,940
I thank you.

566
00:21:07,013 --> 00:21:09,376
Now listen,

567
00:21:09,446 --> 00:21:12,879
long as were
discussing minorities

568
00:21:12,945 --> 00:21:14,878
I'd like to mention
something about language.

569
00:21:14,946 --> 00:21:16,277
There are a
couple of terms

570
00:21:16,348 --> 00:21:17,835
being used a
lot these days

571
00:21:17,913 --> 00:21:19,470
by guilty
white liberals.

572
00:21:19,547 --> 00:21:20,476
First one is,

573
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:22,136
happens to be.

574
00:21:22,212 --> 00:21:23,838
He happens to be black.

575
00:21:23,913 --> 00:21:25,004
I have a friend

576
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,136
who happens to be black.

577
00:21:27,212 --> 00:21:31,009
Like it's a fucking
accident you know?

578
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,204
Happens to be black?

579
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:33,437
Yes he happens
to be black.

580
00:21:33,511 --> 00:21:35,568
Awe yeah, yeah, yeah.

581
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:36,805
He had two black parents?

582
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,311
Oh yes, yes he did.

583
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,968
Yes.

584
00:21:40,044 --> 00:21:40,976
And they fucked?

585
00:21:41,045 --> 00:21:42,703
Oh indeed they did.

586
00:21:42,777 --> 00:21:43,835
Indeed.

587
00:21:43,912 --> 00:21:47,207
So where does the
surprise part come in?

588
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:48,745
I should think it
would be more unusual

589
00:21:48,813 --> 00:21:54,301
if he just happened
to be Scandinavian.

590
00:21:54,378 --> 00:21:56,675
And the other
term is openly.

591
00:21:56,746 --> 00:21:57,835
Openly gay.

592
00:21:57,911 --> 00:22:00,105
They'll say,
he's openly gay.

593
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:01,735
But this... that's
the only minority

594
00:22:01,812 --> 00:22:03,005
they use that for.

595
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:04,135
You know you wouldn't say

596
00:22:04,211 --> 00:22:06,642
someone was openly black.

597
00:22:06,711 --> 00:22:09,836
Well maybe James Brown

598
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,536
or Lewis Farrakhan.

599
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,600
Lewis Farrakhan
is openly black.

600
00:22:14,678 --> 00:22:17,666
Colin Powell is
not openly black.

601
00:22:17,744 --> 00:22:20,835
Colin Powell is
openly white,

602
00:22:20,911 --> 00:22:24,308
he just happens
to be black.

603
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:25,708
Okay.

604
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:27,003
Thank you.

605
00:22:27,077 --> 00:22:28,202
Thank you.

606
00:22:29,645 --> 00:22:30,611
Yeah.

607
00:22:30,678 --> 00:22:32,371
Oh thank you.

608
00:22:32,445 --> 00:22:34,204
Thank you.

609
00:22:34,276 --> 00:22:35,435
And while were at it

610
00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:36,840
when did the word urban

611
00:22:36,911 --> 00:22:39,468
become synonymous
with the word black?

612
00:22:39,544 --> 00:22:42,032
Did I fall asleep for
eight or nine years?

613
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,542
Urban styles, urban
trends, urban music,

614
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,337
I was not consulted
on this at all.

615
00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:48,137
Didn't get an email,
didn't a fax,

616
00:22:48,209 --> 00:22:50,540
didn't get a fucking
postcard, fine!

617
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,633
Let them go.

618
00:22:51,711 --> 00:22:53,039
And I don't
think white women

619
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:56,166
should be calling each
other girlfriend okay?

620
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:59,073
Stop pretending
to be black.

621
00:22:59,143 --> 00:23:00,539
And no matter
what color you are

622
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,905
"you go girl"

623
00:23:01,977 --> 00:23:05,602
should probably go...

624
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:08,164
right along,

625
00:23:08,242 --> 00:23:09,971
right along with
"you the man."

626
00:23:10,044 --> 00:23:11,234
Hey you the man.

627
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:12,002
Oh yeah?

628
00:23:12,075 --> 00:23:16,270
Well you the
fucking honkey.

629
00:23:17,409 --> 00:23:20,499
Now something a little
more positive for you.

630
00:23:20,575 --> 00:23:21,735
Don't want you to think

631
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,207
the whole show is
just negativity.

632
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,866
This is about a festival.

633
00:23:24,942 --> 00:23:26,669
This is my idea
for one of those

634
00:23:26,742 --> 00:23:29,335
big outdoor
summer festivals.

635
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,636
This is called Slugfest.

636
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:33,503
This is for men only.

637
00:23:33,574 --> 00:23:34,666
Here's what you do,

638
00:23:34,742 --> 00:23:36,265
you get about a
hundred thousand

639
00:23:36,343 --> 00:23:37,830
of these fucking men,

640
00:23:37,908 --> 00:23:39,068
you know the ones I mean,

641
00:23:39,142 --> 00:23:41,505
these macho
motherfuckers.

642
00:23:41,575 --> 00:23:44,667
Yeah, these strutting,
preening, posturing,

643
00:23:44,743 --> 00:23:48,195
hairy, sweaty, alpha
male jack offs.

644
00:23:48,274 --> 00:23:50,104
The muscle assholes.

645
00:23:50,175 --> 00:23:51,869
You take about a
hundred thousand

646
00:23:51,942 --> 00:23:53,669
of these
disgusting pricks

647
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:55,502
and you throw them
in a big dirt arena,

648
00:23:55,574 --> 00:23:57,631
big twenty-five
acre dirt arena,

649
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:59,039
and you just let them

650
00:23:59,108 --> 00:24:00,733
beat the shit
out of each other

651
00:24:00,808 --> 00:24:02,671
for twenty-four
hours nonstop,

652
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,934
no food, no water

653
00:24:04,008 --> 00:24:08,133
just whiskey and PCP.

654
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:10,934
And you just let them
punch and pound and kick

655
00:24:11,007 --> 00:24:12,497
the shit out of
each other until

656
00:24:12,575 --> 00:24:13,834
only one guy is
left standing

657
00:24:13,907 --> 00:24:14,964
then you
take that guy

658
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,132
and you put him
on a pedestal

659
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:19,765
and you shoot him
the fucking head.

660
00:24:19,841 --> 00:24:21,569
Yeah.

661
00:24:21,642 --> 00:24:24,472
Yeah.

662
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:26,870
Then you put the
whole thing on TV.

663
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,339
Budweiser would
jump at that shit

664
00:24:28,408 --> 00:24:29,930
in half a minute.

665
00:24:30,008 --> 00:24:31,166
And guys would volunteer.

666
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,297
Guys would line up

667
00:24:32,373 --> 00:24:33,431
all you got to do

668
00:24:33,507 --> 00:24:35,530
is promise them a small
appliance of some kind.

669
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,197
Men will do anything
just give them something

670
00:24:37,273 --> 00:24:38,330
that plugs in the wall

671
00:24:38,406 --> 00:24:41,532
makes a whirring noise.

672
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:44,127
Here's another
male cliché,

673
00:24:44,205 --> 00:24:45,672
these guys who
cut the sleeves

674
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,830
off of their T-shirts

675
00:24:46,906 --> 00:24:48,463
so the rest of us can have

676
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,029
an even more
compelling experience

677
00:24:50,107 --> 00:24:52,868
of smelling
their armpits.

678
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,463
I say, hey Bruno shut it
down would you please?

679
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,303
You smell like an
anchovy's cunt okay?

680
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:01,499
Yeah.

681
00:25:01,574 --> 00:25:04,038
Not good.

682
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,732
Not good Bruno

683
00:25:09,806 --> 00:25:13,261
and definitely
not for sharing.

684
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,703
This is the same
kind of guy

685
00:25:14,772 --> 00:25:16,431
that has that
barbed wire tattoo

686
00:25:16,505 --> 00:25:18,563
that goes all the way
around the bicep.

687
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,004
You've seen that
haven't you?

688
00:25:20,074 --> 00:25:21,765
That's just what
I need some guy

689
00:25:21,838 --> 00:25:24,531
who hasn't been laid
since the bicentennial

690
00:25:24,604 --> 00:25:28,264
wants me to think he's
a bad motherfucker

691
00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:30,829
because he's got
a picture ahha,

692
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:33,428
a painting of some
barbed-wire on his...

693
00:25:33,505 --> 00:25:34,972
I say hey junior
come around

694
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,368
when you have the
real thing on there

695
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:37,098
I'll squeeze that shit on

696
00:25:37,173 --> 00:25:39,103
good and tight
for you okay?

697
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,432
No kidding.

698
00:25:40,504 --> 00:25:41,664
No kidding.

699
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:43,069
This is the same
kind of guy if you,

700
00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:44,365
if you smashed
him in the face

701
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:45,734
eight or nine times

702
00:25:45,805 --> 00:25:47,101
with a big chunk
of concrete

703
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:48,398
and then beat
him over the head

704
00:25:48,471 --> 00:25:49,768
with a steel rod for
an hour and a half

705
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,031
you know what?

706
00:25:51,105 --> 00:25:53,934
He'd drop like
a fucking rock.

707
00:25:54,004 --> 00:25:56,234
Like a rock.

708
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:59,031
Here's another guy
thing that sucks.

709
00:25:59,104 --> 00:26:00,401
These T-shirts that say,

710
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,596
Lead follow or get
out of the way.

711
00:26:02,671 --> 00:26:03,898
You ever see that?

712
00:26:03,972 --> 00:26:05,368
This is more of that

713
00:26:05,437 --> 00:26:06,836
stupid Marine
Corp bullshit.

714
00:26:06,905 --> 00:26:08,870
Obsolete male impulses

715
00:26:08,937 --> 00:26:10,631
from a hundred
thousand years ago.

716
00:26:10,705 --> 00:26:12,829
Lead follow or get
out of the way.

717
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,201
You know what I do

718
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,736
when I see that shirt?

719
00:26:16,903 --> 00:26:18,495
I stand right in
the guys path,

720
00:26:18,571 --> 00:26:19,901
force him to
walk around me,

721
00:26:19,972 --> 00:26:21,164
he gets a
little past me,

722
00:26:21,237 --> 00:26:22,430
I spin him around,

723
00:26:22,504 --> 00:26:23,662
kick him in the nuts,

724
00:26:23,737 --> 00:26:25,293
rip off his shirt,
wipe it on my ass

725
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,927
and shove it down
his fucking throat.

726
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:30,094
That's what I do when
I see that shirt.

727
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,295
Yeah.

728
00:26:32,538 --> 00:26:33,629
Hey, listen,

729
00:26:33,705 --> 00:26:34,998
that's all
these Marine's

730
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:37,264
are looking for
a good time.

731
00:26:37,338 --> 00:26:39,132
And speaking
of tough guys,

732
00:26:39,203 --> 00:26:41,136
I'm getting a little
tired of hearing

733
00:26:41,204 --> 00:26:43,294
that after six
policemen get arrested

734
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,802
for shoving
a floor lamp

735
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,358
up some black guys ass

736
00:26:46,437 --> 00:26:47,903
and ripping his
intestine's out

737
00:26:47,971 --> 00:26:49,335
the police
department announces

738
00:26:49,404 --> 00:26:52,495
they're going to have
sensitivity training.

739
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:54,660
I say hey, if you
need special training

740
00:26:54,736 --> 00:26:56,169
to be told not to jam

741
00:26:56,237 --> 00:26:58,395
a large
cumbersome object

742
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,992
up someone else's asshole

743
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,661
maybe you're
too fucked up

744
00:27:01,737 --> 00:27:03,202
to be on the police
force in the first place

745
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,327
huh?

746
00:27:04,403 --> 00:27:05,595
Maybe.

747
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:06,828
Maybe not.

748
00:27:06,903 --> 00:27:08,198
Maybe not, I don't know.

749
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:09,566
Listen, yeah.

750
00:27:09,637 --> 00:27:14,331
That's right.

751
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:15,526
You know what
they ought to do?

752
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:16,863
They ought to have
two new requirements

753
00:27:16,936 --> 00:27:18,095
for being on the police.

754
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,727
Intelligence and decency.

755
00:27:20,803 --> 00:27:23,030
You never can tell
it might just work.

756
00:27:23,102 --> 00:27:26,160
It certainly hasn't
been tried yet.

757
00:27:26,236 --> 00:27:27,599
No one should ever have

758
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:29,363
any object placed
inside their asshole

759
00:27:29,437 --> 00:27:30,866
that is larger
than a fist

760
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:35,868
and less loving
than a dildo okay?

761
00:27:35,935 --> 00:27:40,027
Now this next thing is
about our president.

762
00:27:40,102 --> 00:27:42,363
This is about
our president.

763
00:27:42,435 --> 00:27:43,696
Bill Jeff.

764
00:27:43,768 --> 00:27:44,755
Bill Jeff.

765
00:27:44,834 --> 00:27:45,823
Bill Jeff.

766
00:27:45,902 --> 00:27:46,994
Clinton.

767
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,625
I don't call him Clinton
I call him Clittin.

768
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:54,328
Clittin, C-L-l-T-T-l-N,
apostroph-e.

769
00:27:54,402 --> 00:27:55,889
His big deal was J.F.K.

770
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:56,729
Isn't that right?

771
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:57,961
Love J.F.K.

772
00:27:58,035 --> 00:27:59,262
Wanted to immolate J.F.K.

773
00:27:59,336 --> 00:28:00,358
In every way.

774
00:28:00,435 --> 00:28:01,662
Well J.F.K.'s
administration

775
00:28:01,735 --> 00:28:03,133
was called Camelot.

776
00:28:03,202 --> 00:28:04,428
Well what it really
should have been called

777
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:06,434
Come A Lot.

778
00:28:06,502 --> 00:28:09,365
Because that's what
he did he came a lot.

779
00:28:09,435 --> 00:28:10,799
So Clinton's
looking for a legacy

780
00:28:10,868 --> 00:28:11,958
that's what he
should call it.

781
00:28:12,034 --> 00:28:14,522
Well maybe come a little
would be better for him

782
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,589
cause he came a little.

783
00:28:15,668 --> 00:28:16,724
You know, a little
on the dress,

784
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:17,926
little on the desk,

785
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:19,261
not a whole lot really.

786
00:28:19,334 --> 00:28:21,061
Hey he was no match,

787
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:24,259
no match for Kennedy in
the pussy department.

788
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:25,526
Kennedy aimed high,

789
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:27,156
Marilyn Monroe.

790
00:28:27,233 --> 00:28:31,326
Clinton showed his dick
to a government clerk.

791
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,127
There's a drop off here.

792
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,394
It's a drop off.

793
00:28:35,468 --> 00:28:38,627
Thank you.

794
00:28:38,701 --> 00:28:40,395
Thank you.

795
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,267
Now... I appreciate it.

796
00:28:42,335 --> 00:28:44,162
Something else I'm
getting tired of

797
00:28:44,232 --> 00:28:46,961
is all this stupid bullshit
we have to listen to

798
00:28:47,034 --> 00:28:49,363
all the time
about children.

799
00:28:49,434 --> 00:28:50,831
It's all you here
in this country.

800
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,991
Children.

801
00:28:52,067 --> 00:28:53,032
Help the children.

802
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:54,088
What about the children?

803
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:55,258
Save the children.

804
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:56,526
You know what I say?

805
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:57,826
Fuck the children.

806
00:28:57,899 --> 00:28:59,525
Fuck 'em.

807
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:02,621
They're getting entirely
too much attention

808
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,029
and I know what you're
thinking you say,

809
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:05,621
Jesus he's not going to
attack children is he?

810
00:29:05,699 --> 00:29:09,496
Yes he is.

811
00:29:09,566 --> 00:29:12,397
He's going to
attack children.

812
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:15,261
And remember this is
Mister Conductor talking.

813
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:18,163
I know what I'm
talking about.

814
00:29:18,232 --> 00:29:21,958
I know what I'm
talking about.

815
00:29:22,031 --> 00:29:24,498
And I also know,

816
00:29:24,566 --> 00:29:26,293
I also know all
you single dad's

817
00:29:26,366 --> 00:29:27,695
and soccer mom's

818
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:29,231
who think you're
such fucking heroes

819
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:30,696
aren't going to
like this

820
00:29:30,765 --> 00:29:32,458
but somebody's got to tell
you for your own good,

821
00:29:32,532 --> 00:29:35,430
you're children are
overrated and overvalued.

822
00:29:35,497 --> 00:29:37,328
You've turned them into
little cult objects.

823
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:40,989
You have a child fetish
and it's not healthy.

824
00:29:41,065 --> 00:29:43,587
And don't give me, don't
give me that weak shit.

825
00:29:43,664 --> 00:29:45,256
Well I love my children.

826
00:29:45,332 --> 00:29:47,889
Fuck you.

827
00:29:47,965 --> 00:29:49,795
Everybody loves
their children.

828
00:29:49,865 --> 00:29:51,489
Doesn't make you special.

829
00:29:51,564 --> 00:29:54,430
John Wayne Gacy
loved his children.

830
00:29:54,499 --> 00:29:57,826
Kept them all right out in
the yard near the garage.

831
00:29:57,897 --> 00:29:59,557
That's not what
I'm talking about.

832
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,461
What I'm talking about
is this constant,

833
00:30:01,532 --> 00:30:03,861
mindless, yammering
in the media,

834
00:30:03,931 --> 00:30:05,726
this neurotic fixation

835
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:07,286
that some how everything,

836
00:30:07,364 --> 00:30:10,558
everything has to be
revolved around children.

837
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:12,653
It's completely
out of balance.

838
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,721
Listen, there are a couple
of things about kids

839
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:15,958
you have to remember.

840
00:30:16,032 --> 00:30:19,655
First of all, they're
not all cute okay?

841
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,060
In fact, if you
look at them close

842
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:24,357
some of them are rather
unpleasant looking.

843
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,261
And a lot of them don't
smell too good either.

844
00:30:27,331 --> 00:30:28,626
The little ones
in particular

845
00:30:28,697 --> 00:30:29,959
seem to have a kind of

846
00:30:30,031 --> 00:30:32,428
urine and sour milk
combination or something.

847
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,945
Stay with me on
this, the longer,

848
00:30:33,996 --> 00:30:34,927
the sooner you face it

849
00:30:34,977 --> 00:30:36,984
the better off
you're going to be.

850
00:30:36,984 --> 00:30:38,756
Second premise,
not all children

851
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:41,290
are smart and
clever got that?

852
00:30:41,364 --> 00:30:43,023
Kids are like any
other group of people,

853
00:30:43,097 --> 00:30:47,153
a few winners a
whole lot of losers.

854
00:30:47,229 --> 00:30:49,252
There are a lot of
loser kids out there

855
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:52,263
who simply aren't
going anywhere.

856
00:30:52,331 --> 00:30:53,851
And you can't
save them all.

857
00:30:53,928 --> 00:30:55,020
You can't save them all.

858
00:30:55,096 --> 00:30:56,154
You got to let them go.

859
00:30:56,228 --> 00:30:57,285
You go to cut them lose.

860
00:30:57,362 --> 00:30:59,159
You got to stop
overprotecting them

861
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,922
cause your making
them too soft.

862
00:31:00,996 --> 00:31:03,486
Today's kids are
way too soft.

863
00:31:03,563 --> 00:31:07,326
For one thing there's too
much emphasis on safety.

864
00:31:07,397 --> 00:31:08,986
Childproof
medicine bottles

865
00:31:09,063 --> 00:31:10,291
and fireproof pajamas,

866
00:31:10,364 --> 00:31:12,691
child restraints in
car seats and helmets,

867
00:31:12,761 --> 00:31:15,558
bicycles, skateboard,
baseball helmet.

868
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,255
Kids have to wear helmets
now for everything

869
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,727
but jerking off.

870
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:21,853
Grown ups have
taken all the fun

871
00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:23,326
out of being a kid

872
00:31:23,395 --> 00:31:25,758
just to save a few
thousand lives.

873
00:31:25,828 --> 00:31:27,260
It's pathetic.

874
00:31:27,329 --> 00:31:29,024
It's pathetic.

875
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,787
What's happening is,

876
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,758
all right,

877
00:31:31,828 --> 00:31:33,316
what's happening,

878
00:31:33,394 --> 00:31:34,382
you know what it is?

879
00:31:34,461 --> 00:31:37,985
These baby boomers, these
soft, fruity baby boomers

880
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,551
are raising an
entire generation

881
00:31:39,629 --> 00:31:41,651
of soft, fruity kids

882
00:31:41,728 --> 00:31:43,752
who aren't even allowed
to have hazardous toys

883
00:31:43,829 --> 00:31:45,352
for Christ's sake.

884
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,520
Hazardous toys shit.

885
00:31:46,595 --> 00:31:48,255
What ever happened
to natural selection?

886
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,691
Survival of the fittest.

887
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,455
The kid who swallows
too many marbles

888
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:54,689
doesn't grow up to
have kids of his own.

889
00:31:54,761 --> 00:31:56,090
Simple as that.

890
00:31:56,161 --> 00:31:57,253
Simple.

891
00:31:57,329 --> 00:31:59,886
Nature, nature.

892
00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:02,018
Nature knows best.

893
00:32:02,094 --> 00:32:04,151
We're saving entirely
too many lives

894
00:32:04,227 --> 00:32:06,490
in this country
of all ages.

895
00:32:06,562 --> 00:32:08,492
Nature should be
allowed to do its job

896
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,390
of killing off the
weak and sickly

897
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,324
and ignorant people
without interference

898
00:32:13,394 --> 00:32:16,189
from air bags and
batting helmets.

899
00:32:16,261 --> 00:32:20,785
Just think of it as
passive euthenics okay?

900
00:32:20,861 --> 00:32:24,089
Now here's another example
of over protection.

901
00:32:24,162 --> 00:32:26,023
Did you ever notice
on the TV news

902
00:32:26,093 --> 00:32:28,754
every time some
guy with an AK 47

903
00:32:28,828 --> 00:32:30,487
strolls onto a school yard

904
00:32:30,561 --> 00:32:32,151
and kills three
or four kids

905
00:32:32,227 --> 00:32:33,385
and a couple
of teachers,

906
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,392
the next day,
the next day

907
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,290
the school is overrun
with counselors

908
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,723
and psychiatrist

909
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:41,054
and grief
counselors

910
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,252
and trauma therapists

911
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:43,658
trying to help
the children cope.

912
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:45,351
Shit when I was in school

913
00:32:45,426 --> 00:32:46,620
someone came to our school

914
00:32:46,694 --> 00:32:48,158
and killed three
or four of us

915
00:32:48,225 --> 00:32:51,091
we went right on
with our arithmetic.

916
00:32:51,161 --> 00:32:56,456
Thirty-five
classmates minus four

917
00:32:56,526 --> 00:32:59,289
equals thirty-one.

918
00:32:59,361 --> 00:33:00,826
We were tough.

919
00:33:00,894 --> 00:33:01,951
We were tough.

920
00:33:02,027 --> 00:33:04,651
I say if kids can handle
the violence at home

921
00:33:04,726 --> 00:33:05,886
they ought to be
able to handle

922
00:33:05,961 --> 00:33:08,256
the violence in school.

923
00:33:08,327 --> 00:33:10,224
I'm not worried about
guns in school,

924
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:11,486
you know what
I'm waiting for?

925
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,821
Guns in church.

926
00:33:13,893 --> 00:33:15,449
That's going to
be a lot of fun.

927
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:16,821
And it will
happen you watch.

928
00:33:16,892 --> 00:33:20,018
Some nut will go fucking
ape shit in a church

929
00:33:20,093 --> 00:33:21,284
and they'll
refer to him as

930
00:33:21,358 --> 00:33:25,347
a disgruntled worshiper.

931
00:33:25,425 --> 00:33:26,619
Here.

932
00:33:26,693 --> 00:33:28,487
Here's another bunch
of ignorant shit.

933
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:30,024
School uniforms.

934
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:32,026
Bad theory.

935
00:33:32,026 --> 00:33:34,048
The idea that if kids
wear uniforms to school

936
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:35,422
it helps keep order.

937
00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:37,583
Don't these schools
do enough damage

938
00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:39,623
making all these
kids think alike

939
00:33:39,691 --> 00:33:42,090
now there going to get
them to look alike too?

940
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,386
And it's not a new idea.

941
00:33:43,459 --> 00:33:46,118
I first saw it in old
newsreel in the 1930's

942
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:47,452
but it was hard
to understand

943
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:51,980
cause the narration
was in German.

944
00:33:53,191 --> 00:33:54,417
All right.

945
00:33:55,725 --> 00:33:56,885
One more.

946
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:58,082
Thank you.

947
00:33:58,157 --> 00:34:00,784
Thank you.

948
00:34:00,858 --> 00:34:03,016
One more item
about children

949
00:34:03,091 --> 00:34:05,716
and that is this
superstitious nonsense

950
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:07,758
that blames
tobacco companies

951
00:34:07,825 --> 00:34:09,380
for kids who smoke.

952
00:34:09,457 --> 00:34:10,980
Listen kids don't smoke

953
00:34:11,058 --> 00:34:14,957
because a camel in
sunglasses tells them to.

954
00:34:15,025 --> 00:34:17,216
They smoke for the
same reasons adults do

955
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:20,745
because it relieves
anxiety and depression.

956
00:34:20,824 --> 00:34:22,290
And you'd be anxious
and depressed too

957
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:23,755
if you had to
put up with these

958
00:34:23,823 --> 00:34:25,085
pathetic, insecure,

959
00:34:25,158 --> 00:34:26,953
striving, anal,
yuppie parents

960
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:28,455
who enroll you in college

961
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,819
before you're old
enough to know

962
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:33,346
which side of the
playpen smells the worst.

963
00:34:33,425 --> 00:34:35,150
And then they fill
you full of Ritalin

964
00:34:35,222 --> 00:34:36,518
and drag you
all over town

965
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:38,316
in search of
meaningless structure.

966
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:40,720
Little League, Cub
Scouts, swimming, soccer,

967
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:44,245
karate, piano, bagpipes,
watercolors, witchcraft,

968
00:34:44,324 --> 00:34:48,552
glass blowing and
dildo practice.

969
00:34:48,624 --> 00:34:49,954
They even,

970
00:34:50,024 --> 00:34:52,718
they even have play
dates for Christ's sakes.

971
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:55,153
Playing is now done
by appointment.

972
00:34:55,222 --> 00:34:56,280
What ever happened to

973
00:34:56,357 --> 00:34:57,720
you show me
your wee wee

974
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:01,187
and I'll show you mine?

975
00:35:01,256 --> 00:35:04,984
Hey no wonder kids
smoke, it helps.

976
00:35:05,057 --> 00:35:06,386
Not as much as weed

977
00:35:06,456 --> 00:35:09,149
but hey you can't
have everything.

978
00:35:09,222 --> 00:35:10,189
You know it's true,

979
00:35:10,257 --> 00:35:12,346
parents are burning these
kids out on structure.

980
00:35:12,422 --> 00:35:15,149
I think everyday
all children

981
00:35:15,221 --> 00:35:17,620
should have three
hours of daydreaming,

982
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,382
just daydreaming.

983
00:35:19,455 --> 00:35:22,218
You could use it a little
of it yourself by the way.

984
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,754
Just sit at the window
stare at the clouds

985
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:24,947
it's good for you.

986
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:26,216
Do you want
to know how

987
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,515
you can help
your children?

988
00:35:27,588 --> 00:35:29,885
Leave them the fuck alone!

989
00:35:32,655 --> 00:35:33,849
Very well.

990
00:35:36,122 --> 00:35:37,553
Thank you very much.

991
00:35:38,288 --> 00:35:38,947
Okay.

992
00:35:41,755 --> 00:35:43,618
All right now a
little change of pace.

993
00:35:43,689 --> 00:35:45,313
Little change
of intensity.

994
00:35:45,387 --> 00:35:46,319
I want you to know

995
00:35:46,388 --> 00:35:47,377
what's on
television tonight

996
00:35:47,456 --> 00:35:48,387
on the other channels.

997
00:35:48,456 --> 00:35:49,578
Always like people
to know what it is

998
00:35:49,653 --> 00:35:51,949
they're missing by
listening to my shit.

999
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,647
First of all on the
Playboy channel

1000
00:35:54,722 --> 00:35:56,948
on the Playboy
channel tonight

1001
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,783
they have one of those
new reality shows

1002
00:35:58,855 --> 00:36:00,877
where the people at home
send in their own tapes

1003
00:36:00,955 --> 00:36:05,047
it's called, Home
Videos of Bad Fucking.

1004
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,585
And speaking of that
delightful activity

1005
00:36:07,653 --> 00:36:09,517
I guess you know last
week Rickey Lake

1006
00:36:09,587 --> 00:36:10,884
had a special program

1007
00:36:10,956 --> 00:36:12,511
Women Who Fake Orgasms

1008
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,076
so tonight not
to be out done

1009
00:36:14,154 --> 00:36:15,984
Jerry Springer has
a night time special

1010
00:36:16,055 --> 00:36:19,077
Men Who Fake
Bowel Movements.

1011
00:36:19,154 --> 00:36:20,484
Yeah I think they're
running out of topics

1012
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:22,019
on those shows too.

1013
00:36:22,087 --> 00:36:23,280
Sally Jesse's
next show is

1014
00:36:23,354 --> 00:36:24,753
Rapist's Who Force
Their Victims

1015
00:36:24,821 --> 00:36:27,547
to Play Yahtzee
Beforehand.

1016
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,381
Getting a little
strange on daytime TV.

1017
00:36:30,453 --> 00:36:33,681
Then later on tonight
on the Nostalgia Channel

1018
00:36:33,753 --> 00:36:35,117
they're going to
play back-to-back

1019
00:36:35,187 --> 00:36:36,483
two of my
favorite episodes

1020
00:36:36,554 --> 00:36:37,883
of Little House
on the Prairie.

1021
00:36:37,954 --> 00:36:40,444
First of all of the
1975 Christmas show,

1022
00:36:40,522 --> 00:36:43,488
A Douche Bag for Clara.

1023
00:36:43,555 --> 00:36:44,711
Wasn't that good?

1024
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:46,844
And it was sad toward
the end when she cried

1025
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,215
cause she stuck it
in the wrong hole.

1026
00:36:51,286 --> 00:36:53,116
But as they say
in the U.S. Navy,

1027
00:36:53,187 --> 00:36:56,948
there is no wrong hole.

1028
00:36:57,019 --> 00:36:59,985
And then right after that
they're going to play

1029
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:02,145
my favorite Little House
on the Prairie of all time,

1030
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,515
Missy Takes A Big
Dump In The Woods.

1031
00:37:05,586 --> 00:37:06,811
And that was
interesting I thought

1032
00:37:06,885 --> 00:37:08,045
cause she had on
the high heels

1033
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:09,085
and the long dress

1034
00:37:09,153 --> 00:37:10,345
and it was fun to watch

1035
00:37:10,419 --> 00:37:13,750
how she had to maneuver
through the poison sumac.

1036
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,285
And they didn't have
toilet paper in those days

1037
00:37:16,353 --> 00:37:20,786
she had to use a
series of pinecones.

1038
00:37:20,853 --> 00:37:24,876
And she was pulling them
in the wrong direction.

1039
00:37:24,953 --> 00:37:25,919
Yes.

1040
00:37:25,986 --> 00:37:27,384
I understand toward
the end of the show

1041
00:37:27,452 --> 00:37:28,815
they had to bleep
out a lot of

1042
00:37:28,885 --> 00:37:31,147
screaming and
foul language.

1043
00:37:31,218 --> 00:37:33,047
And then hey, hey,

1044
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:35,777
later on tonight
on pay-per-view,

1045
00:37:35,851 --> 00:37:37,613
on pay-per-view
Willie Nelson.

1046
00:37:37,686 --> 00:37:40,514
Willie Nelson's concert
is on and TV Guide listed

1047
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:42,278
all the songs he's
going to sing.

1048
00:37:42,352 --> 00:37:43,748
He's going to start out
with one my favorites,

1049
00:37:43,817 --> 00:37:47,943
Too Drunk To Jerk Off,
isn't that a good one?

1050
00:37:48,017 --> 00:37:49,450
God I love that song.

1051
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:51,575
Then he's going to do
a series of love songs.

1052
00:37:51,651 --> 00:37:54,846
Kiss Me I'm Coming,
awe that's a good one.

1053
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:56,214
Kiss me I'm coming.

1054
00:37:56,285 --> 00:37:57,343
Hold me I'm humming.

1055
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,815
Hmmmm.

1056
00:37:59,884 --> 00:38:02,010
Well I can't help
it, I am a romantic

1057
00:38:02,085 --> 00:38:05,141
and I do enjoy the
sentimental tunes.

1058
00:38:05,217 --> 00:38:06,547
Here's a sad song,

1059
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:10,709
I should of Fucked
Ole' What's Her Name.

1060
00:38:10,784 --> 00:38:11,875
Remember that?

1061
00:38:11,951 --> 00:38:13,712
I should of never
played the game.

1062
00:38:13,784 --> 00:38:17,681
I should of fucked
ole' what's her name.

1063
00:38:17,749 --> 00:38:19,717
Here's one my mother used
to sing around the house.

1064
00:38:19,785 --> 00:38:23,740
You're Love Ran Down My
Leg and Now You're Gone.

1065
00:38:23,818 --> 00:38:24,680
Yeah.

1066
00:38:24,749 --> 00:38:25,875
Yeah.

1067
00:38:25,951 --> 00:38:27,417
That one always got to me.

1068
00:38:27,484 --> 00:38:30,348
I'm glad you feel
the same way.

1069
00:38:30,418 --> 00:38:32,009
Here's a fine love song.

1070
00:38:32,085 --> 00:38:37,072
You Blew My Mind
Now Blow Me.

1071
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,878
He even,

1072
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:42,178
he's even going to do
a Stevie Wonder song,

1073
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:45,216
I Just Called To Say
I Tested Positive.

1074
00:38:45,283 --> 00:38:46,442
Yeah.

1075
00:38:46,517 --> 00:38:47,777
Well you don't want
to leave anybody out

1076
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:49,110
you know what I mean?

1077
00:38:49,183 --> 00:38:50,648
And hey, and hey,

1078
00:38:50,716 --> 00:38:52,274
what would a Willie
Nelson show be

1079
00:38:52,351 --> 00:38:53,871
without a couple
of cowboy songs?

1080
00:38:53,949 --> 00:38:55,313
He's going to do that one

1081
00:38:55,382 --> 00:38:57,007
George Jones and
Waylon Jennings wrote,

1082
00:38:57,082 --> 00:38:58,446
Drinking Beer,
Taking A Shit

1083
00:38:58,516 --> 00:39:00,107
and Passing Out.

1084
00:39:00,183 --> 00:39:01,614
Then he's going
to do a kind of

1085
00:39:01,683 --> 00:39:03,240
traditional western song,

1086
00:39:03,317 --> 00:39:04,613
one that Gene
Autry used to sing

1087
00:39:04,684 --> 00:39:06,808
when I was a little boy,
It's Midnight in Montana

1088
00:39:06,883 --> 00:39:10,475
and I Can't Get My
Dick Out of this Cow.

1089
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:13,981
I love that song.

1090
00:39:14,049 --> 00:39:15,778
I always liked it.

1091
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:16,906
Yeah.

1092
00:39:16,983 --> 00:39:18,210
You know why I like
that song so much?

1093
00:39:18,283 --> 00:39:21,181
Cause it's a real
cowboy song,

1094
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:25,306
and by the way, speaking
of cattle fucking,

1095
00:39:25,382 --> 00:39:26,847
do you know why it is

1096
00:39:26,915 --> 00:39:28,313
when a rancher
fucks a sheep

1097
00:39:28,382 --> 00:39:30,110
he does so at the
edge of a cliff?

1098
00:39:30,183 --> 00:39:35,443
It's so the sheep
will push back.

1099
00:39:35,515 --> 00:39:37,641
Little something for you.

1100
00:39:39,348 --> 00:39:40,838
Yes.

1101
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:42,505
Just a little tip
for you outdoorsmen

1102
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:44,571
when you're out camping.

1103
00:39:46,682 --> 00:39:49,306
Now this next thing
is about names

1104
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,176
that's all names.

1105
00:39:51,248 --> 00:39:52,942
Names are an
interest of mine.

1106
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:53,981
Not a hobby.

1107
00:39:54,049 --> 00:39:55,378
Hobby's cost money.

1108
00:39:55,448 --> 00:39:56,970
Interest are free.

1109
00:39:57,048 --> 00:39:58,208
This is just about names.

1110
00:39:58,282 --> 00:40:00,406
Did you ever notice how
they name singles bars?

1111
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,969
Singles bars have
all the same kind of

1112
00:40:03,048 --> 00:40:04,980
cutesy little one word
names that end in 'S.'

1113
00:40:05,048 --> 00:40:08,013
Scamps, Tramps, Chats,
Rumors, Cahoots, Cheers,

1114
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,739
Chances, Mingles,
Risks, Gambits, Notions,

1115
00:40:10,813 --> 00:40:13,144
hey if I had a singles bar
you know what I'd call it?

1116
00:40:13,214 --> 00:40:16,441
Nipples and Dicks.

1117
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,640
A little truth
in advertising.

1118
00:40:18,714 --> 00:40:20,771
The Sperm Club.

1119
00:40:20,847 --> 00:40:24,302
Snatch-O-Rama.

1120
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:27,368
The Crotchiteria,

1121
00:40:27,446 --> 00:40:30,005
Frankie's Fuckery,

1122
00:40:30,081 --> 00:40:35,603
Café Vagina,
Open All Night.

1123
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,340
Well I'm an old
fashioned guy.

1124
00:40:38,414 --> 00:40:40,345
I'm old-fashioned
cause I believe

1125
00:40:40,413 --> 00:40:41,845
the name on the
outside of a place

1126
00:40:41,913 --> 00:40:43,278
ought to let you know

1127
00:40:43,348 --> 00:40:44,811
what's going on
in the inside.

1128
00:40:44,879 --> 00:40:47,108
Here would be a good name
for a gay restaurant,

1129
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,611
The Mouthful, huh?

1130
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,374
Come on that's
clever shit,

1131
00:40:51,447 --> 00:40:52,843
that's a double
pun Goddamn it,

1132
00:40:52,912 --> 00:40:55,209
you didn't think of it.

1133
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,040
Besides you don't
have to eat there

1134
00:40:57,112 --> 00:40:58,739
if you don't want to.

1135
00:40:58,814 --> 00:41:04,006
No, no, just go in
have a cocktail.

1136
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,876
Or a high ball.

1137
00:41:07,947 --> 00:41:09,708
Here's another name
I don't care for,

1138
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,268
TGI Fridays.

1139
00:41:11,346 --> 00:41:12,743
You know these cutesy
ass little places,

1140
00:41:12,812 --> 00:41:15,539
TGI Fridays.

1141
00:41:15,612 --> 00:41:19,101
That whole TGIF thing was
cute for about an hour,

1142
00:41:19,179 --> 00:41:20,805
about an hour,

1143
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,503
and that was 65 years ago

1144
00:41:22,577 --> 00:41:24,272
when someone first
said it on the radio.

1145
00:41:24,346 --> 00:41:25,674
Not cute anymore,

1146
00:41:25,744 --> 00:41:29,074
time to start bombing
these locations.

1147
00:41:29,145 --> 00:41:30,475
TGI Fridays.

1148
00:41:30,545 --> 00:41:32,013
If I had a
place like that

1149
00:41:32,013 --> 00:41:33,307
you know what
I'd call it?

1150
00:41:33,378 --> 00:41:34,969
H-S-l-O-W,

1151
00:41:35,046 --> 00:41:39,309
Holy Shit its
Only Wednesday.

1152
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,640
I think people would
drink a lot more liquor

1153
00:41:42,712 --> 00:41:47,803
if they thought it was
Wednesday all the time.

1154
00:41:47,878 --> 00:41:49,707
Well I'm just looking
for a little honesty

1155
00:41:49,778 --> 00:41:51,176
in these names,
little honesty.

1156
00:41:51,245 --> 00:41:52,574
That's not asking a lot.

1157
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,371
I'm thinking of
opening up a motel

1158
00:41:54,444 --> 00:41:57,412
and calling it The
Sleep and Fuck.

1159
00:41:57,479 --> 00:42:00,034
Wouldn't that be a good
honest name for a motel?

1160
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:03,076
Who needs this Shady
Pines bullshit?

1161
00:42:03,144 --> 00:42:05,906
The Sleep and Fuck Motel.

1162
00:42:05,977 --> 00:42:07,637
Get me one of them
big neon signs,

1163
00:42:07,711 --> 00:42:10,074
Sleep... Fuck.

1164
00:42:10,144 --> 00:42:12,111
Sleep... fuck.

1165
00:42:12,178 --> 00:42:13,236
Sleep and fuck.

1166
00:42:13,312 --> 00:42:14,334
Sleep and fuck.

1167
00:42:14,411 --> 00:42:15,378
Sleep and Fuck.

1168
00:42:15,445 --> 00:42:17,136
Sleep... fuck.

1169
00:42:17,209 --> 00:42:19,301
Sleep... fuck.

1170
00:42:23,678 --> 00:42:25,075
Sleep and Fuck.

1171
00:42:25,144 --> 00:42:26,336
Sleep and Fuck.

1172
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,900
You put it right at
the Jersey entrance

1173
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:31,670
to the Holland
Tunnel you know?

1174
00:42:31,743 --> 00:42:33,107
Actually Fuck and Sleep

1175
00:42:33,177 --> 00:42:34,905
would be a little more
accurate wouldn't it?

1176
00:42:34,978 --> 00:42:36,373
Best name for a
motel would be

1177
00:42:36,442 --> 00:42:38,137
The Fuck and Smoke and
Sleep and Rollover

1178
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:39,401
and Get Out of Bed
and Wash Your Crotch

1179
00:42:39,475 --> 00:42:41,170
and Go Out and Buy
Two Cans Mr. Pibb

1180
00:42:41,244 --> 00:42:44,038
and Go Home and Fuck
A Whole Lot More.

1181
00:42:44,109 --> 00:42:46,042
A whole lot more.

1182
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,507
Cause that's all
they ever have left

1183
00:42:47,576 --> 00:42:49,736
in those soda machines
on Sunday nights.

1184
00:42:49,811 --> 00:42:53,766
Mr. Pibb and Diet
Shasta Orange

1185
00:42:53,844 --> 00:42:55,398
and that yellow can

1186
00:42:55,475 --> 00:43:01,238
of Canada Dry Tonic
Water that nobody wants!

1187
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:03,275
And speaking of
naming things,

1188
00:43:03,342 --> 00:43:05,536
am I the only person
in this country

1189
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:07,472
who's laughing when
these commercials

1190
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:11,635
come on television for
Snapper lawn mowers?

1191
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:14,038
Isn't there anyone else
on this fading republic

1192
00:43:14,108 --> 00:43:16,699
who knows what
a snapper is?

1193
00:43:16,775 --> 00:43:19,641
A snapper is a pussy okay?

1194
00:43:19,709 --> 00:43:20,969
That's what it means,

1195
00:43:21,042 --> 00:43:23,134
snapper means pussy

1196
00:43:23,209 --> 00:43:25,640
It's derived from an
older more specific term

1197
00:43:25,709 --> 00:43:28,140
snappin' pussy,

1198
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:29,869
which describes a
particular type of pussy.

1199
00:43:29,944 --> 00:43:31,430
One with good, quick
muscular control,

1200
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:33,270
kind of an elasticity
in the vaginal wall

1201
00:43:33,342 --> 00:43:34,706
that can grab
a hold of you

1202
00:43:34,776 --> 00:43:36,072
and give you a decent hump

1203
00:43:36,142 --> 00:43:37,665
do you know what
I'm talking about?

1204
00:43:37,741 --> 00:43:41,640
A snappin' pussy.

1205
00:43:41,709 --> 00:43:45,038
But now, now snapper
means any kind of pussy

1206
00:43:45,108 --> 00:43:48,337
and they've named a lawn
mower company after it.

1207
00:43:48,409 --> 00:43:51,704
Now I have seen a few
snappers in my day,

1208
00:43:51,775 --> 00:43:55,469
never seen one
that'll cut grass.

1209
00:43:55,542 --> 00:43:56,439
No.

1210
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:57,700
No.

1211
00:43:57,774 --> 00:43:59,537
Maybe do a little edging,

1212
00:43:59,609 --> 00:44:01,403
a little edging
along the driveway

1213
00:44:01,474 --> 00:44:04,407
after a party that's
all you can hope for.

1214
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:08,462
But you know weed whacker
you can understand.

1215
00:44:08,874 --> 00:44:11,034
Now a lot of these
company names

1216
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:12,300
and product names

1217
00:44:12,374 --> 00:44:13,704
are influenced
by marketing

1218
00:44:13,775 --> 00:44:15,330
and advertising people

1219
00:44:15,407 --> 00:44:17,737
and this next thing
is about advertising

1220
00:44:17,807 --> 00:44:19,433
and by the way if
you should have any

1221
00:44:19,508 --> 00:44:21,473
cognitive dissonance
about the fact

1222
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,870
that I do commercials
for 10-10-2-20

1223
00:44:23,941 --> 00:44:26,272
and still attack
advertising up here

1224
00:44:26,342 --> 00:44:28,169
well you're just
going to have

1225
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,569
to figure that shit
out on your own okay?

1226
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:36,096
Now, this is called
advertising lullaby.

1227
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:37,571
Keeping in mind of course

1228
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,367
that the whole
purpose of advertising

1229
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,133
is to lull
you to sleep.

1230
00:44:42,206 --> 00:44:45,035
Quality, values, styles,
service, selection,

1231
00:44:45,105 --> 00:44:47,470
convenience, economy,
savings, performance,

1232
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,597
experience,
hospitality, low-rates,

1233

risk, no obligation,

00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:08,471
no entry fee, no
hidden charges,

1243
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,766
no purchase necessary,

1244
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,031
no one will call on you,

1245
00:45:11,105 --> 00:45:14,901
no payments or interest
till September.

1246
00:45:14,972 --> 00:45:19,530
But limited time only,
so act now, order today,

1247
00:45:19,606 --> 00:45:21,698
send no money, offer good

batteries not included,
mileage may vary,

1250
00:45:25,873 --> 00:45:27,168
all sales are final,

00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:28,670
allow six weeks

1252
00:45:28,738 --> 00:45:30,398

It's our way of

00:46:32,937 --> 00:46:34,700
Actually it's
our way of saying

1280
00:46:34,772 --> 00:46:37,565
bend over just a
little bit farther

1281

so we can stick this
big advertising dick

00:46:40,038 --> 00:46:42,196
up your ass a
little bit deeper.

1283
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:43,496
A little bit deeper.

1284
00:46:43,569 --> 00:46:46,297
A little bit deeper.

1285
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:53,364
You miserable,

1286
00:46:53,437 --> 00:46:56,368
no good, fucking
consumer asshole.

1287
00:46:57,769 --> 00:46:59,759
Cause you do know folks
living in this country

1288
00:46:59,836 --> 00:47:01,268
you're bound to know,

1289
00:47:01,337 --> 00:47:03,632
that every time you're
exposed to advertising

1290
00:47:03,703 --> 00:47:05,101
you realize once again

1291
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:06,657
that America's
leading industry,

1292
00:47:06,735 --> 00:47:08,532
America's most
profitable business

1293
00:47:08,604 --> 00:47:10,899
is still the
manufacture packaging,

1294
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:13,900
distribution and
marketing of bullshit.

1295
00:47:13,968 --> 00:47:16,936
High quality, grade
'A', prime cut,

1296
00:47:17,003 --> 00:47:19,195
pure American bullshit

1297
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:20,564
and the sad part is,

1298
00:47:20,635 --> 00:47:22,726
is that most people seem
to have been indoctrinated

1299
00:47:22,802 --> 00:47:24,359
to believe that bullshit

1300
00:47:24,436 --> 00:47:26,061
only comes from
certain places,

1301
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:27,328
certain sources,

1302
00:47:27,402 --> 00:47:30,665
advertising, politics,
salesmen, not true,

1303
00:47:30,736 --> 00:47:32,393
bullshit is everywhere.

1304
00:47:32,467 --> 00:47:33,866
Bullshit is rampant.

1305
00:47:33,936 --> 00:47:35,127
Parents are full of shit,

1306
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,394
teachers are
full of shit,

1307
00:47:36,468 --> 00:47:37,798
clergymen are
full of shit

1308
00:47:37,869 --> 00:47:40,892
and law enforcement
people are full of shit.

1309
00:47:40,969 --> 00:47:43,366
This entire country,

1310
00:47:43,435 --> 00:47:47,561
this entire country is
completely full of shit

1311
00:47:47,635 --> 00:47:49,295
and always has been

1312
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:50,923
from the Declaration
of Independence

1313
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,763
of the Constitution to
the Star Spangled Banner

1314
00:47:52,835 --> 00:47:55,426
it's still nothing more
than one big steaming pile

1315
00:47:55,502 --> 00:47:58,989
of red, white and blue
all American bullshit

1316
00:47:59,067 --> 00:48:02,556
because think of
how we started.

1317
00:48:02,634 --> 00:48:03,657
Think of that.

1318
00:48:03,734 --> 00:48:05,063
This country was founded

1319
00:48:05,134 --> 00:48:07,068
by a group of slave owners

1320
00:48:07,136 --> 00:48:09,725
who told us all men
are created equal.

1321
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,390
Oh yeah, all
men except for

1322
00:48:11,466 --> 00:48:13,933
Indians and niggers
and women right?

1323
00:48:14,001 --> 00:48:15,523
Always like to use

1324
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,260
that authentic
American language.

1325
00:48:17,334 --> 00:48:19,595
This was a small
group of unelected,

1326
00:48:19,667 --> 00:48:21,896
white male, land
holding, slave owners

1327
00:48:21,968 --> 00:48:24,229
who also suggested
their class

1328
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:26,495
be the only one
allowed to vote.

1329
00:48:26,568 --> 00:48:29,556
Now that is what's known
as being stunningly

1330
00:48:29,634 --> 00:48:32,929
and embarrassingly
full of shit.

1331
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,159
And I think, I
think Americans

1332
00:48:35,234 --> 00:48:37,700
really show their
ignorance when they say

1333
00:48:37,768 --> 00:48:40,029
they want their
politicians to be honest.

1334
00:48:40,099 --> 00:48:43,260
What are these fucking
creedents talking about?

1335
00:48:43,334 --> 00:48:45,457
If honesty were suddenly

1336
00:48:45,532 --> 00:48:47,362
introduced into
American life

1337
00:48:47,433 --> 00:48:49,955
the whole system
would collapse.

1338
00:48:50,033 --> 00:48:51,659
No one would
no what to do.

1339
00:48:51,733 --> 00:48:54,255
Honesty would fuck
this country up.

1340
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:56,662
And I think deep down
Americans know that.

1341
00:48:56,732 --> 00:48:58,130
That's why they elected

1342
00:48:58,199 --> 00:49:01,427
and re-elected
Bill Clinton.

1343
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:06,057
That's right.

1344
00:49:06,133 --> 00:49:09,258
Because, because
the American people

1345
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:11,127
liked their bullshit
right out front

1346
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:14,222
where they can get a
good strong whiff of it.

1347
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,856
Clinton might
be full of shit

1348
00:49:15,933 --> 00:49:18,228
but at least he
lets you know it.

1349
00:49:18,299 --> 00:49:20,232
Dole tried to
hide it didn't he?

1350
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,957
Dole kept saying, I'm
a plain and honest man.

1351
00:49:23,031 --> 00:49:24,828
Bullshit.

1352
00:49:24,899 --> 00:49:26,329
People don't believe that.

1353
00:49:26,398 --> 00:49:27,592
What did Clinton say?

1354
00:49:27,666 --> 00:49:29,030
He said, Hi folks.

1355
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:32,463
I'm completely full shit
and how do you like that?

1356
00:49:32,533 --> 00:49:34,497
And the people said,
You know something?

1357
00:49:34,564 --> 00:49:37,621
At least he's honest.

1358
00:49:37,698 --> 00:49:39,222
At least he's honest

1359
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,560
about being completely
full of shit.

1360
00:49:42,398 --> 00:49:44,093
It's just like the
business world.

1361
00:49:44,166 --> 00:49:45,495
Same as business.

1362
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:47,723
Everybody knows by
now all businessmen

1363
00:49:47,798 --> 00:49:50,263
are completely
full of shit.

1364
00:49:50,331 --> 00:49:52,661
Just the worse kind
of low life criminal,

1365
00:49:52,731 --> 00:49:54,958
cocksuckers you could
ever want to run into.

1366
00:49:55,031 --> 00:49:57,692
The fucking piece
of shit businessman.

1367
00:49:57,766 --> 00:49:59,854
And the proof of it,
the proof of it is

1368
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,488
they don't even
trust each other.

1369
00:50:01,564 --> 00:50:03,028
They don't trust
one another.

1370
00:50:03,096 --> 00:50:04,654
When a businessman
sets down

1371
00:50:04,731 --> 00:50:06,095
and negotiates a deal

1372
00:50:06,165 --> 00:50:07,959
the first thing he
does is automatically

1373
00:50:08,031 --> 00:50:10,724
assume that the other guy
is a complete lying prick

1374
00:50:10,797 --> 00:50:13,094
who's trying to fuck
him out of his money.

1375
00:50:13,165 --> 00:50:14,789
So he's got to do
everything he can

1376
00:50:14,864 --> 00:50:16,832
to fuck the other guy
a little bit faster

1377
00:50:16,899 --> 00:50:18,590
and a little bit harder.

1378
00:50:18,663 --> 00:50:19,994
And he's got to do it

1379
00:50:20,064 --> 00:50:21,792
with a big smile
on his face.

1380
00:50:21,865 --> 00:50:24,591
You know that big
bullshit businessman smile

1381
00:50:24,664 --> 00:50:27,562
and if you're a
customer whoa,

1382
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:30,255
that's when you get
the really big smile.

1383
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:33,023
Customer always gets
the really big smile

1384
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:34,427
as the businessman

1385
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:36,189
carefully
positions himself

1386
00:50:36,262 --> 00:50:38,229
directly behind
the customer

1387
00:50:38,297 --> 00:50:39,921
and unzips his pants

1388
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:43,292
and proceeds to
service the account.

1389
00:50:43,363 --> 00:50:45,693
I'm servicing
this account.

1390
00:50:45,764 --> 00:50:49,321
This customer
needs service.

1391
00:50:49,397 --> 00:50:52,363
Now you know
what they mean.

1392
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:54,192
Now you know what they
mean when they say,

1393
00:50:54,264 --> 00:50:57,661
We specialize in
customer service.

1394
00:50:57,730 --> 00:50:59,752
Whoever coined the phrase,

1395
00:50:59,829 --> 00:51:01,419
"let the buyer beware"

1396
00:51:01,496 --> 00:51:05,986
was probably bleeding
from the asshole.

1397
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:08,755
But that's business.

1398
00:51:08,828 --> 00:51:10,886
That's business.

1399
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:14,155
But in the bullshit
department,

1400
00:51:14,228 --> 00:51:15,422
in the bullshit department

1401
00:51:15,496 --> 00:51:18,018
a businessman
can't hold a candle

1402
00:51:18,095 --> 00:51:19,823
to a clergyman.

1403
00:51:19,896 --> 00:51:21,417
Cause I got to tell
you the truth folks,

1404
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:22,928
I got to tell
you the truth,

1405
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,984
when it comes to bullshit,

1406
00:51:25,062 --> 00:51:28,619
big time, major
league bullshit

1407
00:51:28,695 --> 00:51:31,558
you have to stand in awe,

1408
00:51:31,627 --> 00:51:34,254
in awe of the
all time champion

1409
00:51:34,329 --> 00:51:36,817
of false promises and
exaggerated claims

1410
00:51:36,895 --> 00:51:38,088
religion,

1411
00:51:38,162 --> 00:51:39,559
no contest.

1412
00:51:39,628 --> 00:51:42,685
No contest.

1413
00:51:42,762 --> 00:51:44,193
Religion,

1414
00:51:44,261 --> 00:51:46,022
religion easily has

1415
00:51:46,094 --> 00:51:49,391
the greatest bullshit
story ever told.

1416
00:51:49,462 --> 00:51:50,789
Think about it.

1417
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:54,258
Religion has actually
convinced people

1418
00:51:54,327 --> 00:51:58,919
that there's an invisible
man living in the sky

1419
00:51:58,994 --> 00:52:00,756
who watches
everything you do,

1420
00:52:00,828 --> 00:52:02,816
every minute of every day

1421
00:52:02,894 --> 00:52:05,054
and the invisible man
has a special list

1422
00:52:05,129 --> 00:52:08,923
of ten things he does
not want you to do.

1423
00:52:08,993 --> 00:52:10,983
And if you do any
of these ten things

1424
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:14,391
he has a special place
full of fire and smoke

1425
00:52:14,461 --> 00:52:16,517
and burning and
torture and anguish

1426
00:52:16,594 --> 00:52:18,787
where he will send
you to live and suffer

1427
00:52:18,861 --> 00:52:20,258
and burn and choke

1428
00:52:20,327 --> 00:52:22,384
and scream and cry
forever and ever

1429
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,892
till the end of time.

1430
00:52:24,961 --> 00:52:27,289
But he loves you.

1431
00:52:33,294 --> 00:52:37,659
He loves you.

1432
00:52:37,727 --> 00:52:42,385
He loves you and
he needs money.

1433
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:45,120
He always needs money.

1434
00:52:45,194 --> 00:52:47,090
He's all-powerful, all
perfect, all knowing

1435
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:52,854
and all wise somehow
just can't handle money.

1436
00:52:52,926 --> 00:52:55,916
Religion takes in
billions of dollars,

1437
00:52:55,993 --> 00:52:57,855
they pay no taxes,

1438
00:52:57,926 --> 00:53:00,119
and they always
need a little more.

1439
00:53:00,192 --> 00:53:03,523
Now you talk about a
good bullshit story,

1440
00:53:03,594 --> 00:53:07,046
holy shit!

1441
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,216
Thank you.

1442
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,052
Thank you.

1443
00:53:16,926 --> 00:53:18,188
But... thank you very much.

1444
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,126
But I want you to know,

1445
00:53:22,193 --> 00:53:23,679
I want you to
know something,

1446
00:53:23,758 --> 00:53:25,191
this is sincere,
I want you to know

1447
00:53:25,259 --> 00:53:27,418
when it comes to
believing in God

1448
00:53:27,493 --> 00:53:28,719
I really tried.

1449
00:53:28,792 --> 00:53:30,951
I really, really tried.

1450
00:53:31,026 --> 00:53:32,958
I tried to believe
that there is a God

1451
00:53:33,026 --> 00:53:34,457
who created each of us

1452
00:53:34,525 --> 00:53:35,752
in his own image
and lightness,

1453
00:53:35,824 --> 00:53:37,312
loves us very much

1454
00:53:37,391 --> 00:53:39,154
and keeps a close
eye on things,

1455
00:53:39,226 --> 00:53:40,658
I really tried
to believe that.

1456
00:53:40,726 --> 00:53:42,519
But I got to tell you
the longer you live,

1457
00:53:42,591 --> 00:53:44,022
the more you look around,

1458
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:47,580
the more you realize
something is fucked up.

1459
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:49,624
Something is wrong here.

1460
00:53:49,691 --> 00:53:52,248
War, disease, death,
destruction, hunger,

1461
00:53:52,324 --> 00:53:54,587
filth, poverty, torture,
crime, corruption

1462
00:53:54,659 --> 00:53:57,784
and the Ice Capades

1463
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:00,255
something is
definitely wrong.

1464
00:54:00,324 --> 00:54:02,018
This is not good work.

1465
00:54:02,091 --> 00:54:03,852
If this is the
best God can do

1466
00:54:03,925 --> 00:54:05,584
I am not impressed.

1467
00:54:05,658 --> 00:54:07,283
Results like these
do not belong

1468
00:54:07,357 --> 00:54:09,687
on the resume of
a supreme being.

1469
00:54:09,758 --> 00:54:11,519
This is the kind of
shit you'd expect

1470
00:54:11,591 --> 00:54:14,954
from an office temp
with a bad attitude.

1471
00:54:15,024 --> 00:54:17,583
And just between you and
me, between you and me

1472
00:54:17,659 --> 00:54:19,384
in any decently
run universe

1473
00:54:19,456 --> 00:54:20,923
this guy would have been

1474
00:54:20,989 --> 00:54:23,821
out on his all-powerful
ass a long time ago.

1475
00:54:23,891 --> 00:54:25,254
And by the way,

1476
00:54:25,323 --> 00:54:27,290
I say this guy because
I firmly believe,

1477
00:54:27,357 --> 00:54:29,515
looking at these results,
that if there is a God

1478
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:31,318
it has to be a man.

1479
00:54:31,391 --> 00:54:33,356
No woman could
or would ever

1480
00:54:33,423 --> 00:54:35,856
fuck things up like this.

1481
00:54:35,925 --> 00:54:39,152
So, so,

1482
00:54:39,224 --> 00:54:41,917
lf,

1483
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:44,353
If there is a
God, if there is,

1484
00:54:44,423 --> 00:54:46,946
I think most reasonable
people might agree

1485
00:54:47,024 --> 00:54:49,784
that he's at least
incompetent and maybe,

1486
00:54:49,856 --> 00:54:52,948
just maybe doesn't
give a shit.

1487
00:54:53,024 --> 00:54:54,251
Doesn't give a shit,

1488
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:55,844
which I admire
in a person

1489
00:54:55,922 --> 00:54:57,389
and which would
explain a lot

1490
00:54:57,456 --> 00:54:58,943
of these bad results.

1491
00:54:59,022 --> 00:55:00,751
So rather than
be just another

1492
00:55:00,823 --> 00:55:02,344
mindless religious robot,

1493
00:55:02,422 --> 00:55:04,150
mindlessly and aimlessly

1494
00:55:04,223 --> 00:55:05,712
and blindly believing
that all of this

1495
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:07,584
is in the hands
of some spooky

1496
00:55:07,656 --> 00:55:08,918
incompetent father figure

1497
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:10,545
who doesn't give a shit,

1498
00:55:10,622 --> 00:55:12,089
I decided to look around

1499
00:55:12,157 --> 00:55:13,882
for something
else to worship.

1500
00:55:13,955 --> 00:55:15,478
Something I could
really count on

1501
00:55:15,555 --> 00:55:17,987
and immediately I
thought of the sun.

1502
00:55:18,056 --> 00:55:19,283
Happened like that.

1503
00:55:19,356 --> 00:55:22,550
Overnight I became
a sun worshiper.

1504
00:55:22,621 --> 00:55:23,849
Well not overnight,

1505
00:55:23,923 --> 00:55:26,081
you can't see
the sun at night

1506
00:55:26,155 --> 00:55:29,451
but first thing
the next morning

1507
00:55:29,522 --> 00:55:32,282
I became a sun worshiper.

1508
00:55:32,354 --> 00:55:34,048
Several reasons,

1509
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:36,053
first of all I
can see the sun

1510
00:55:36,121 --> 00:55:38,850
okay?

1511
00:55:38,923 --> 00:55:39,978
Yeah.

1512
00:55:40,054 --> 00:55:41,646
Unlike some other
God's I could mention,

1513
00:55:41,722 --> 00:55:43,653
I can actually
see the sun.

1514
00:55:43,721 --> 00:55:44,948
I'm big on that.

1515
00:55:45,022 --> 00:55:46,580
If I can see something,
I don't know,

1516
00:55:46,656 --> 00:55:49,418
it kind of helps the
creditability along you know?

1517
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:51,510
So everyday I
can see the sun

1518
00:55:51,587 --> 00:55:53,612
as it gives me
everything I need

1519
00:55:53,689 --> 00:55:56,211
heat, light, food,
flowers in the park,

1520
00:55:56,289 --> 00:55:57,947
reflections on
the lake,

1521
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,886
an occasional skin
cancer but hey

1522
00:56:00,955 --> 00:56:02,852
at least there were
no crucifixions

1523
00:56:02,921 --> 00:56:04,511
and were not setting
people on fire

1524
00:56:04,587 --> 00:56:07,020
simply because they
don't agree with us.

1525
00:56:07,088 --> 00:56:09,279
Sun worship is
fairly simple,

1526
00:56:09,353 --> 00:56:10,979
there's no mystery,
no miracles,

1527
00:56:11,054 --> 00:56:12,609
no pageantry, no
one asks for money,

1528
00:56:12,686 --> 00:56:14,119
there are no
songs to learn

1529
00:56:14,187 --> 00:56:15,710
and we don't have
special building

1530
00:56:15,788 --> 00:56:20,049
where we all gather once a
week to compare clothing.

1531
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,609
And the best thing,

1532
00:56:21,687 --> 00:56:23,177
the best thing
about the sun

1533
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:25,015
it never tells
me I'm unworthy.

1534
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:26,781
Doesn't tell me
I'm a bad person

1535
00:56:26,855 --> 00:56:28,149
who needs to be saved.

1536
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,948
Hasn't said an
unkind word.

1537
00:56:30,021 --> 00:56:32,283
Treats me fine.

1538
00:56:32,354 --> 00:56:34,682
So I worship the sun

1539
00:56:34,753 --> 00:56:36,946
but I don't
pray to the sun

1540
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,351
know why?

1541
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:40,352
I wouldn't presume
on our friendship.

1542
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:41,646
It's not polite.

1543
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:43,151
I've often thought
people treat God

1544
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:44,687
rather rudely don't you?

1545
00:56:44,754 --> 00:56:47,742
Asking up trillions and
trillions of prayers everyday.

1546
00:56:47,819 --> 00:56:50,284
Asking and pleading
and begging for favors.

1547
00:56:50,352 --> 00:56:51,785
Do this, give me that,
I need a new car,

1548
00:56:51,854 --> 00:56:53,318
I want a better job

1549
00:56:53,386 --> 00:56:54,909
and most of this praying

1550
00:56:54,986 --> 00:56:56,452
takes place on Sunday,

1551
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,747
his day off.

1552
00:56:58,819 --> 00:57:02,411
It's not nice and it's
no way to treat a friend.

1553
00:57:02,487 --> 00:57:04,314
But people do pray
and they pray

1554
00:57:04,385 --> 00:57:05,612
for a lot of
different things.

1555
00:57:05,685 --> 00:57:08,846
You know you're sister needs
an operation on her crotch.

1556
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:13,148
Your brother was arrested
for defecating in a mall.

1557
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,412
But most of all you'd
really like to fuck

1558
00:57:15,486 --> 00:57:16,917
that hot little red head

1559
00:57:16,985 --> 00:57:18,746
down at the
convenient store.

1560
00:57:18,818 --> 00:57:20,216
You know the one
with the eye patch

1561
00:57:20,286 --> 00:57:22,116
and the clubfoot huh?

1562
00:57:22,186 --> 00:57:23,672
Can you pray for that?

1563
00:57:23,751 --> 00:57:25,582
I think you'd have to.

1564
00:57:25,653 --> 00:57:28,710
And I say fine, pray
for anything you want,

1565
00:57:28,786 --> 00:57:30,478
pray for anything but

1566
00:57:30,551 --> 00:57:32,541
what about the
divine plan?

1567
00:57:32,619 --> 00:57:33,948
Remember that?

1568
00:57:34,019 --> 00:57:35,416
The divine plan;

1569
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:37,918
long time ago God
made a divine plan.

1570
00:57:37,986 --> 00:57:39,474
Gave it a lot of thought,

1571
00:57:39,552 --> 00:57:41,846
decided it was a good
plan, put into practice

1572
00:57:41,918 --> 00:57:43,612
and for billions and
billions of years

1573
00:57:43,685 --> 00:57:46,344
the divine plan has
been doing just fine.

1574
00:57:46,418 --> 00:57:48,975
Now you come along and
pray for something.

1575
00:57:49,051 --> 00:57:50,676
Well suppose the
thing you want

1576
00:57:50,751 --> 00:57:52,877
isn't in God's
divine plan.

1577
00:57:52,951 --> 00:57:54,281
What do you
want him to do

1578
00:57:54,351 --> 00:57:56,612
change his plan
just for you?

1579
00:57:56,684 --> 00:57:58,174
Doesn't it seem a
little arrogant?

1580
00:57:58,252 --> 00:57:59,411
It's a divine plan.

1581
00:57:59,486 --> 00:58:00,881
What's the use
of being God

1582
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:02,247
if every run down schmuck

1583
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:03,475
with a two-dollar
prayer book

1584
00:58:03,549 --> 00:58:05,540
can come along and
fuck up your plan?

1585
00:58:05,618 --> 00:58:07,015
And here's
something else,

1586
00:58:07,084 --> 00:58:08,606
another problem
you might have,

1587
00:58:08,684 --> 00:58:10,742
suppose your prayers
aren't answered,

1588
00:58:10,817 --> 00:58:11,976
what do you say?

1589
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:13,415
Well it's God's will.

1590
00:58:13,485 --> 00:58:14,746
Thy will be done.

1591
00:58:14,818 --> 00:58:16,511
Fine but if
it's God's will

1592
00:58:16,585 --> 00:58:17,949
and he's going to do
what he wants to anyway

1593
00:58:18,019 --> 00:58:20,916
why the fuck bother
praying in the first place?

1594
00:58:20,984 --> 00:58:23,677
Seems like a big
waste of time to me.

1595
00:58:23,751 --> 00:58:25,909
Couldn't you just
skip the praying part

1596
00:58:25,983 --> 00:58:27,915
and go right to his will?

1597
00:58:27,983 --> 00:58:29,540
It's all very confusing.

1598
00:58:29,617 --> 00:58:30,946
So to get around
a lot of this

1599
00:58:31,017 --> 00:58:33,312
I decided to
worship the sun

1600
00:58:33,383 --> 00:58:35,782
but as I said I don't
pray to the sun.

1601
00:58:35,851 --> 00:58:37,314
You know who I pray to?

1602
00:58:37,382 --> 00:58:40,076
Joe Peshi.

1603
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:41,547
Joe Peshi.

1604
00:58:41,616 --> 00:58:42,980
Joe Peshi.

1605
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:45,140
Two reasons, first of all
I think he's a good actor

1606
00:58:45,216 --> 00:58:46,342
okay?

1607
00:58:46,417 --> 00:58:47,542
To me that counts.

1608
00:58:47,617 --> 00:58:48,673
Second,

1609
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:52,013
he looks like a guy who
can get things done.

1610
00:58:52,082 --> 00:58:55,016
Joe Peshi doesn't
fuck around.

1611
00:58:55,084 --> 00:58:57,446
Doesn't fuck around.

1612
00:58:57,516 --> 00:59:00,039
In fact,

1613
00:59:00,117 --> 00:59:02,309
in fact, Joe Peshi
came through

1614
00:59:02,383 --> 00:59:05,042
on a couple of things that
God was having trouble with.

1615
00:59:05,116 --> 00:59:06,911
For years I asked
God to do something

1616
00:59:06,982 --> 00:59:09,210
about my noisy neighbor
with the barking dog,

1617
00:59:09,283 --> 00:59:11,112
Joe Peshi straightened
that cocksucker out

1618
00:59:11,182 --> 00:59:13,274
with one visit.

1619
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:15,109
It's amazing what
you can accomplish

1620
00:59:15,181 --> 00:59:18,272
with a simple
baseball bat.

1621
00:59:18,348 --> 00:59:22,212
So I've been praying to
Joe for about a year now

1622
00:59:22,282 --> 00:59:23,840
and I noticed something.

1623
00:59:23,917 --> 00:59:25,609
I noticed that
all the prayers

1624
00:59:25,682 --> 00:59:27,171
I used to offer to God

1625
00:59:27,249 --> 00:59:29,407
and all the prayers I
now offer to Joe Peshi

1626
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:30,972
are being
answered at about

1627
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:33,479
the same fifty
percent rate.

1628
00:59:33,547 --> 00:59:35,208
Half the time I
get what I want,

1629
00:59:35,283 --> 00:59:36,805
half the time I don't.

1630
00:59:36,882 --> 00:59:39,040
Same as God, fifty-fifty.

1631
00:59:39,115 --> 00:59:40,809
Same as the
four-leaf clover

1632
00:59:40,882 --> 00:59:42,211
and the horseshoe,

1633
00:59:42,282 --> 00:59:43,714
the wishing well and
the rabbit's foot.

1634
00:59:43,782 --> 00:59:45,247
Same as the Mojo man.

1635
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:46,678
Same as the Voodoo lady

1636
00:59:46,748 --> 00:59:48,146
who tells you your fortune

1637
00:59:48,215 --> 00:59:49,647
by squeezing the
goat's testicles,

1638
00:59:49,715 --> 00:59:51,474
it's all the
same fifty-fifty.

1639
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:53,571
So just pick your
superstition, sit back,

1640
00:59:53,649 --> 00:59:56,046
make a wish and
enjoy yourself

1641
00:59:56,115 --> 00:59:58,103
and for those of you
who look to the Bible

1642
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:01,170
for a moral lessons
and literary qualities

1643
01:00:01,248 --> 01:00:02,611
I might suggest

1644
01:00:02,681 --> 01:00:03,942
a couple of other
stories for you.

1645
01:00:04,015 --> 01:00:06,105
You might want to look
at the Three Little Pigs,

1646
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:07,511
that's a good one.

1647
01:00:07,582 --> 01:00:09,102
Has a nice happy ending.

1648
01:00:09,179 --> 01:00:10,338
I'm sure you'll like that.

1649
01:00:10,413 --> 01:00:11,846
Then there's Little
Red Riding Hood

1650
01:00:11,915 --> 01:00:13,313
although it does have
that X-rated part

1651
01:00:13,382 --> 01:00:14,677
where the big bad wolf

1652
01:00:14,748 --> 01:00:16,713
actually eats
the grandmother,

1653
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,144
which I didn't care
for by the way.

1654
01:00:19,214 --> 01:00:22,374
And finally I've often
always drawn a great deal

1655
01:00:22,446 --> 01:00:25,436
of moral comfort
from Humpty Dumpty.

1656
01:00:25,514 --> 01:00:26,878
The part I like the best,

1657
01:00:26,948 --> 01:00:28,878
all the king's horses
and all the king's men

1658
01:00:28,946 --> 01:00:31,810
couldn't put Humpty Dumpty
back together again.

1659
01:00:31,879 --> 01:00:33,846
That's because there
is no Humpty Dumpty

1660
01:00:33,914 --> 01:00:35,742
and there is no God.

1661
01:00:35,812 --> 01:00:39,245
None, not one, no
God, never was.

1662
01:00:39,313 --> 01:00:42,542
In fact, I'm going
to put it this way,

1663
01:00:42,614 --> 01:00:44,204
if there is a God,

1664
01:00:44,281 --> 01:00:46,009
if there is a God

1665
01:00:46,078 --> 01:00:50,342
may he strike this
audience dead.

1666
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:52,209
See nothing happened.

1667
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:55,302
Everybody's
okay all right.

1668
01:00:55,379 --> 01:00:57,676
Tell you what,

1669
01:00:57,747 --> 01:01:00,268
tell you what I'll
raise the stakes.

1670
01:01:00,345 --> 01:01:02,209
I'll raise the
stakes a little bit;

1671
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:05,870
if there is a God may
he strike me dead.

1672
01:01:05,945 --> 01:01:07,310
See nothing
happened wait

1673
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:09,971
I got a little
cramp in my leg

1674
01:01:10,046 --> 01:01:12,136
and my balls hurt.

1675
01:01:12,212 --> 01:01:15,043
Plus I'm blind.

1676
01:01:15,113 --> 01:01:16,578
Now I'm okay again,

1677
01:01:16,646 --> 01:01:18,613
must have been
Joe Peshi.

1678
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,508
God Bless Joe Peshi.

1679
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:21,739
Thank you all very much.

1680
01:01:21,813 --> 01:01:23,006
Joe bless you.

1681
01:01:23,077 --> 01:01:24,270
Thank you all very much.

1682
01:01:24,344 --> 01:01:26,539
I appreciate it.

1683
01:01:34,379 --> 01:01:35,140
Bye bye.

1684
01:01:35,212 --> 01:01:36,303
Have fun.

1685
01:01:36,378 --> 01:01:37,435
Good.

1686
01:01:37,511 --> 01:01:38,909
Thank you very much.

1687
01:01:49,344 --> 01:01:50,674
Have a good time,

1688
01:01:50,745 --> 01:01:53,108
Have a good
time, thank you.
