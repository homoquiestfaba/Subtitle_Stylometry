1
00:00:03,955 --> 00:00:07,000
We always tought alien life
would come from the stars.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,000
But it came from deep beneath the Pacific.

3
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:15,862
What the hell is going on?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,400
First Kaiju made land in San Francisco.

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,500
The second attack hit Manila.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,500
And the third one hit Cabo.

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,500
And we learned this was not gonna stop.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,578
In order to fight monsters,

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,810
we created monsters of our own.

10
00:00:42,017 --> 00:00:43,710
FROM DIRECTOR
GUILLERMO DEL TORO

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,000
We needed a new weapon.

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
The Jaeger program was born.

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,800
Two pilots, our minds, our memories

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,100
Connected

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And man and machine become one.

16
00:01:08,564 --> 00:01:09,381
On July 12th

17
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:18,295
GO
BIG

18
00:01:18,296 --> 00:01:20,000
Today, at the edge of our hope,

19
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,034
OR GO
EXTINCT

20
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:27,600
at the end of our time,

21
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,700
we've chosen to believe in each other.

22
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,300
Today, we face the monsters
that are at our door!

23
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,500
Today, we are cancelling the apocalypse!

24
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,658
It is pretty cool.

25
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,110
PACIFIC RIM

26
00:02:19,076 --> 00:02:20,850
07 12 13

27
00:02:20,885 --> 00:02:21,790

28
00:02:21,825 --> 00:02:23,181
SEE IT IN REALD 3D AND IMAX 3D
