1
00:02:06,572 --> 00:02:08,499
Hey, you all packed?

2
00:02:10,076 --> 00:02:11,557
I don't want you to
miss your flight.

3
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:20,353
Hey, hey.

4
00:02:21,212 --> 00:02:23,782
Hey. I don't want to
see you upset, okay?

5
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,052
Jen, look at me, okay?

6
00:02:29,178 --> 00:02:30,447
I don't have to go.

7
00:02:30,471 --> 00:02:32,074
Yes, yes.

8
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:35,661
Jen, you need to go.

9
00:02:35,685 --> 00:02:37,520
You need to go home.

10
00:02:38,062 --> 00:02:40,173
We need to get help.

11
00:02:41,607 --> 00:02:43,919
This'll be good
for you all right?

12
00:02:43,943 --> 00:02:45,837
Get back on track.

13
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:47,965
Maybe get on some meds,
this will be good for you.

14
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:49,549
I promise.

15
00:02:53,244 --> 00:02:56,869
I just really need
my friend right now.

16
00:03:00,543 --> 00:03:02,699
Got something for you.

17
00:03:18,978 --> 00:03:21,088

Hello?

24

Is someone there?

25
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:51,155
Jesus Christ, Keaton.

26
00:05:52,423 --> 00:05:54,900
Hey. What the hell
is wrong with you?

27
00:05:56,427 --> 00:05:58,399
Nothing's wrong with me.

28
00:05:58,512 --> 00:06:01,035
Nothing at all.

29
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:02,660
Your powers out.

30
00:06:02,684 --> 00:06:03,869
Yeah, I know my powers,

31
00:06:03,893 --> 00:06:06,037
You can't just walk in here.

32
00:06:06,061 --> 00:06:07,301
Why not?

33
00:06:07,646 --> 00:06:09,757
Because you don't live here.

34
00:06:11,275 --> 00:06:12,669
Ok, come down.

35
00:06:12,693 --> 00:06:13,837
Don't tell me to calm down.

36
00:06:13,861 --> 00:06:14,672
No, no.

37
00:06:14,696 --> 00:06:17,299
I think it's a good idea for you to
calm down when you have that knife

38
00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:18,323
in your hand.

39
00:06:23,537 --> 00:06:24,959
That I heard something.

40
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:26,893
Heard something?

41
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:28,292
What did you hear?

42
00:06:32,546 --> 00:06:34,748
Did you hear from Sam?

43
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:36,424
That it?

44
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:39,750
Fuck off.

45
00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:42,906
Yo. I'm really a-

46
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,634
Sorry I mentioned Sam.

47
00:07:00,658 --> 00:07:02,844
I didn't know you
were so sensitive.

48
00:07:02,868 --> 00:07:04,971
Not sensitive.

49
00:07:04,995 --> 00:07:06,807
She's coming back.

50
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:09,353
It's been, what, since
the 20th of last month?

51
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,105
What are you, a calendar?

52
00:07:13,462 --> 00:07:14,838
The fuck.

53
00:07:15,464 --> 00:07:17,901
I'm just saying that
you got back in the 15

54
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:20,028
and you're in a good mood
for, like, three or four days.

55
00:07:20,052 --> 00:07:22,280
And then what do you
know about my mood?

56
00:07:22,304 --> 00:07:25,286
That you're much more fun
when you're in a good one.

57
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:28,286
Yeah, I can say the
same thing about you.

58
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,914
Sorry if my bad moods getting
in the way of your good time.

59
00:07:30,938 --> 00:07:34,288
But my entire future
is riding on Sam. So.

60
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,261
You wanna go out?

61
00:07:44,285 --> 00:07:45,524
It's raining.

62
00:07:46,453 --> 00:07:48,839
So? you like the rain.

63
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:53,019
I don't know.

64
00:07:53,043 --> 00:07:57,494
C'mon, it'll take
your mind off of her..

65
00:07:58,716 --> 00:07:59,943
You know, we're not in anything

66
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:01,711
anymore, right Keaton?

67
00:08:06,473 --> 00:08:07,473
I know

68
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:11,541
what I hurt your feelings?

69
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,457
No. What are you
even doing right now?

70
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:16,592
I told you I thought
I heard something.

71
00:08:18,903 --> 00:08:20,338
I'm just going to
take a wild guess.

72
00:08:20,362 --> 00:08:24,124
But don't you think it
could have been storm?

73
00:08:56,732 --> 00:08:58,843
Hey Stu!

74
00:09:01,153 --> 00:09:02,300
What?

75
00:09:04,907 --> 00:09:06,885
I just haven't seen

76
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:10,055
you dance like that
in a long time.

77
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:11,593
Don't be weird.

78
00:09:12,998 --> 00:09:15,310
Still selling those zippers Jen?

79
00:09:15,334 --> 00:09:18,063
Yeah, I'm still
selling the zippers.

80
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:20,059
Why you wanna buy some?

81
00:09:20,547 --> 00:09:21,317
Why do you ask me that?

82
00:09:21,341 --> 00:09:24,231
Every time I come in here,
Making fun of me, too now?

83
00:09:24,885 --> 00:09:27,960
No, he's just jealous. Jen.

84
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:30,408
I don't need you
to stand up for me.

85
00:09:30,432 --> 00:09:34,699
Yeah, I know that

86
00:09:35,604 --> 00:09:38,083
you're just jealous, Stu.

87
00:09:38,107 --> 00:09:39,299
Oh, I'm jealous?

88
00:09:40,609 --> 00:09:43,179
Oh, I'm jealous, too.

89
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:45,757
She's going to be
a millionaire, Stu.

90
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:51,516
Keaton stop it. Why?

91
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,852
Seriously, shut the fuck up.

92
00:09:57,918 --> 00:09:58,918
Okay.

93
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:06,181
Hey. Hi.

94
00:10:06,802 --> 00:10:08,446
Can I buy you a beer?

95
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,990
Actually, I just.

96
00:10:10,014 --> 00:10:11,298
Just got one.

97
00:10:11,473 --> 00:10:14,089
Ah, get lost, bro. What's up?

98
00:10:15,227 --> 00:10:18,393
I said get lost
for your own sake.

99
00:10:19,398 --> 00:10:21,049
That your boyfriend?

100
00:10:22,067 --> 00:10:24,212
No. No, he's not.

101
00:10:24,236 --> 00:10:25,089
Listen bro, it's not.

102
00:10:25,113 --> 00:10:27,674
It's not an offense or,
personal to you it's just.

103
00:10:27,698 --> 00:10:30,093
She's very peculiar.

104
00:10:30,117 --> 00:10:32,887
About size -Oh my God.

105
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:33,972
You fucking kidding me?

106
00:10:33,996 --> 00:10:35,765
No I'm not.

107
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:38,084
Leave me alone.

108
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,230
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

109
00:10:42,254 --> 00:10:45,900
Listen to me. Hey.

I'm sorry, pal.

112
00:10:50,637 --> 00:10:53,390
I apologize.

113
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:56,161

114
00:10:56,185 --> 00:10:59,247
- Yeah Stu. Get the bitch a beer.

115
00:10:59,271 --> 00:11:02,574
Why don't you take
a walk, buddy?

116
00:11:04,985 --> 00:11:06,004
You want me to walk away?

117
00:11:06,028 --> 00:11:08,505
Yeah, I want you to walk away.

118
00:11:10,032 --> 00:11:12,260
- Hey, stop it.
- No no no.

119
00:11:12,284 --> 00:11:14,028
I'm gonna walk away

120
00:11:14,328 --> 00:11:16,163
I'm gonna walk away.

121
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:22,014
I'll take a walk.

122
00:11:41,647 --> 00:11:46,601
Mm mm.

123
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:52,983
Mm. Wow.

124
00:12:32,281 --> 00:12:33,427
I'm sorry.

125
00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:38,929
For what, Keaton?

126
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,063
For today.

127
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,642
Last year.

128
00:12:53,802 --> 00:12:58,665
I just want things to go
back to normal between us.

129
00:13:02,644 --> 00:13:05,305
I miss you.

130
00:15:36,465 --> 00:15:37,567
Sam?

131
00:15:37,591 --> 00:15:38,401
Of course it's me!

132
00:15:38,425 --> 00:15:39,320
Who else would it be?

133
00:15:39,344 --> 00:15:43,105
I've been calling you
for the last hour.

134
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:45,241
Jen, are you listening?

135
00:15:45,265 --> 00:15:47,160
It's early.

136
00:15:47,184 --> 00:15:48,619
Where have you been?

137
00:15:48,643 --> 00:15:51,414
I'm at JFK, Jen Listen up.

138
00:15:51,438 --> 00:15:53,640
I've been trying to get
in touch with you, Sam.

139
00:15:53,732 --> 00:15:55,710
I know, I know. I know.
Things have gotten crazy.

140
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:58,786
But. Jen. Listen, I got news.

141
00:15:58,811 --> 00:15:59,656
Okay.

142
00:15:59,681 --> 00:16:03,120
Big, gigantic fucking news.

143
00:16:04,034 --> 00:16:04,928
The fuck?

144
00:16:04,952 --> 00:16:07,153
Hello? Jen?

145
00:16:08,455 --> 00:16:10,058
Are you even
listening right now?

146
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:10,900
Yeah.

147
00:16:10,925 --> 00:16:14,102
I met this super successful
guy a couple of weeks ago.

148
00:16:14,127 --> 00:16:16,105
Inherited his dad's
business or something.

149
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:19,859
And Jen, he wants to fund us.

150
00:16:19,883 --> 00:16:21,944
- Wait, for real?
- Yes! Can you believe it?

151
00:16:21,968 --> 00:16:25,776
He wants to help
us with everything.

152
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:29,535
Have you discussed
strategy or development?

153
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:32,220
Yeah. We'll get there. We'll get
there. I promise. This is real.

154
00:16:32,354 --> 00:16:35,083
Trust me. He's invited
us out on his yacht.

155
00:16:35,107 --> 00:16:38,043
For the week to talk
ideas and sign contracts.

156
00:16:38,068 --> 00:16:39,420
Wait, when?

157
00:16:39,444 --> 00:16:42,702
Today! You still have
your passport, right?

158
00:16:43,365 --> 00:16:44,592
I need a passport?

159
00:16:44,616 --> 00:16:46,761
I just told you. His yachts
in the Virgin Islands.

160
00:16:46,785 --> 00:16:49,055
A car will pick you up and bring
it to the plane in an hour.

161
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:50,079
Okay?

162
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:53,893
Sam. Sam.

163
00:16:53,917 --> 00:16:57,312
I haven't heard from you in
weeks, and I'm just supposed to-

164
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,183
This, this feels
really fast. Like

165
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,862
out of nowhere.

166
00:17:04,886 --> 00:17:07,547
You are going to have to
trust me on this, all right?

167
00:17:08,765 --> 00:17:12,495
It's like a second
chance for us.

168
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:16,006
This is it. Are you in?

169
00:17:31,788 --> 00:17:35,459
You have reached the
voicemail box of... Keaton.

170
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:38,169
At the beep.

171
00:18:50,784 --> 00:18:52,261
Here you are, ma'am.

172
00:18:52,285 --> 00:18:53,285
Thanks.

173
00:20:39,768 --> 00:20:40,914
Jen!

174
00:20:41,186 --> 00:20:42,663
Oh, my God.

175
00:20:42,687 --> 00:20:45,394
Look, who made it, finally.

176
00:20:48,902 --> 00:20:51,425
Hello hello.

177
00:20:51,738 --> 00:20:54,300
Oh my god, hey girl.

178
00:20:54,324 --> 00:20:55,926
Where the hell have you been?

179
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,568
Around -What are you wearing?

180
00:20:58,593 --> 00:20:59,484
Yachting attire.

181
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:00,655
What do you think?

182
00:21:01,748 --> 00:21:03,100
There he is.

183
00:21:03,124 --> 00:21:05,740
Been waiting for you. We're
about ready to head out.

184
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,170
Grab your bag.

185
00:21:10,715 --> 00:21:11,715
Lemme get that.

186
00:21:13,635 --> 00:21:15,029
Hi -Jen.

187
00:21:15,053 --> 00:21:17,390
- David Calperson, welcome.
- Nice to meet you.

188
00:21:17,415 --> 00:21:18,194
Thank you.

189
00:21:18,219 --> 00:21:20,253
- Sam's told me a lot about you.
- Really?

190
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:20,994
It's funny.

191
00:21:21,018 --> 00:21:23,265
- I've heard almost nothing about you.
- Ha!

192
00:21:23,603 --> 00:21:25,956
Well, that's okay,
because I was bluffing.

193
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,750
Honestly, Sam only
talks about herself.

194
00:21:27,774 --> 00:21:30,160
Yeah, that sounds
about right You guys!

195
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,549
- John. shoes off.
- Oh.

196
00:21:35,573 --> 00:21:37,042
Lose the shoes.

197
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,432
John. Hey John
watch the teak man!

198
00:21:43,456 --> 00:21:46,811
C'mon! What have I told
you? Tell the guys.

199
00:21:46,835 --> 00:21:48,312
Jen, hurry up.

200
00:21:48,336 --> 00:21:49,346
Coming

201
00:21:54,634 --> 00:21:55,781
salon.

202
00:21:55,927 --> 00:21:58,267
I think this room is
pretty self-explanatory.

203
00:21:59,139 --> 00:22:01,386
Crazy, right?

204
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,798
Hey, come on.

205
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:05,329
I wanna show you the bridge.

206
00:22:05,353 --> 00:22:08,060
It's very cool. Watch your step.

207
00:22:08,273 --> 00:22:12,086
So here we have a state of
the art navigation system.

208
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:12,999
World class.

209
00:22:13,024 --> 00:22:14,588
Not to mention our
crew is as well.

210
00:22:14,612 --> 00:22:16,493
- How you doing boys?
- Welcome.

211
00:22:16,698 --> 00:22:17,360
Thank you.

212
00:22:17,385 --> 00:22:19,009
Say hello to the boys.

213
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:21,095
Hey -Over here. We got radar.

214
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:23,597
As you can see, security cameras
to protect us from pirates.

215
00:22:23,621 --> 00:22:24,724
Safety first.

216
00:22:24,748 --> 00:22:27,601
And, I don't know, buttons
and lights and stuff.

217
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,645
Hey, gentlemen, when you're
ready, go ahead and take us out.

218
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:30,724
Yes, sir, Captain.

219
00:22:31,921 --> 00:22:34,903
- Did they just call you Captain?
- Huh...

220
00:22:35,842 --> 00:22:36,842
Weird.

221
00:22:37,927 --> 00:22:39,321
If you follow me down here
I'll show you the bedrooms.

222
00:22:39,345 --> 00:22:41,266
There's three of them. So
you can take your pick.

223
00:22:41,306 --> 00:22:42,242
You can bunk up together.

224
00:22:42,266 --> 00:22:44,994
I don't care. International waters.
No judgment. This is my bedroom.

225
00:22:45,018 --> 00:22:46,370
If you need anything,
it's bigger.

226
00:22:46,394 --> 00:22:46,872
It's nicer.

227
00:22:46,896 --> 00:22:49,623
I'm staying here because
this is a yacht after all.

228
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:50,417
We'll meet up for dinner.

229
00:22:50,441 --> 00:22:54,707
I have to make a
phone call to Beijing.

230
00:22:55,195 --> 00:22:56,797
But please make
yourselves at home.

231
00:22:56,821 --> 00:22:58,257
The crew, the
contents of the ship.

232
00:22:58,281 --> 00:23:00,634
Everything is completely
at your disposal.

233
00:23:00,658 --> 00:23:01,844
Okay. I'll see you
soon. Don't go in there.

234
00:23:01,868 --> 00:23:03,337
Just kidding. Go
wherever you want.

235
00:23:25,433 --> 00:23:27,787
So what's new back at home?

236
00:23:27,811 --> 00:23:30,701
Give me something juicy.

237
00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:36,086
Keaton came over
there other night.

238
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,946
Fuck him.

239
00:23:41,658 --> 00:23:44,386
I've been having these
dreams about him.

240
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,246
You mean nightmares?

241
00:23:47,163 --> 00:23:49,090
More like memories.

242
00:23:52,126 --> 00:23:55,017
You ever have a dream
that felt totally real?

243
00:23:55,797 --> 00:23:57,127
Yeah, sure.

244
00:23:58,341 --> 00:24:00,236
When I'm drunk or

245
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,822
after I've eaten
too much cheese.

246
00:24:02,846 --> 00:24:05,461
Like a ton of cheese.

247
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:08,255
I call them cheese dreams

248
00:24:09,894 --> 00:24:10,894
right.

249
00:24:13,022 --> 00:24:17,426
Well, I had one of those
dreams about Keaton.

250
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:22,049
In the dream I killed him.

251
00:24:22,657 --> 00:24:25,318
Ugh, scary.

252
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,370
Yeah.

253
00:24:33,918 --> 00:24:36,488
I'm sorry I didn't call more

254
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:41,402
do you have any idea how many hospitals
I called trying to find you, I thought.

255
00:24:41,426 --> 00:24:43,821
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

256
00:24:43,845 --> 00:24:45,955
I really am.

257
00:24:48,266 --> 00:24:51,662
You know, you probably
won't believe me,

258
00:24:51,686 --> 00:24:54,248
but I tell everyone about you.

259
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,834
We wouldn't be here
if it weren't for you.

260
00:24:56,858 --> 00:25:00,528
God, you are so much smarter
than all of David's friends.

261
00:25:04,407 --> 00:25:05,407
All right.

262
00:25:07,035 --> 00:25:10,014
You should still
feel guilty about it.

263
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:13,158
But I'm gonna work on it.

264
00:25:15,126 --> 00:25:17,282
Where's David?

265
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:18,913
I don't know

266
00:25:19,172 --> 00:25:21,099
I think I miss him.

267
00:25:21,215 --> 00:25:22,943
- Oh my God.
- What?

268
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:26,030
Are you listening to yourself?

269
00:25:26,054 --> 00:25:27,448
I'm going to go find him.

270
00:25:27,472 --> 00:25:29,261
If rhat's okay with you.

271
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,899
Let me check my schedule.

272
00:25:36,147 --> 00:25:38,667
Yep. Works for me.

273
00:25:38,691 --> 00:25:39,532
All right.

274
00:25:39,557 --> 00:25:40,566
All right.

275
00:25:41,611 --> 00:25:43,217
Ta ta!

276
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:26,215
Sorry.

277
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:27,383
And done.

278
00:26:27,407 --> 00:26:28,921
Yeah. Okay.

279
00:26:30,785 --> 00:26:33,389
So how did you two meet?

280
00:26:33,413 --> 00:26:35,432
Sam picked me up at a bar.

281
00:26:35,456 --> 00:26:38,072
- Yeah, you believe that, right?
- It's true.

282
00:26:38,126 --> 00:26:40,020
She found out that I
was an entrepreneur.

283
00:26:40,044 --> 00:26:42,292
And she just kind
of glommed onto me.

284
00:26:43,131 --> 00:26:45,608
Sam's built quite the reputation
for you, too, in New York.

285
00:26:45,883 --> 00:26:47,486
He's lying.

286
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,116
I'm not.

287
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:56,657
Anybody else want an Ambien?

288
00:26:57,228 --> 00:26:58,329
No.

289
00:26:58,646 --> 00:27:01,125
The last time that I took
an Ambien, I woke up,

290
00:27:01,149 --> 00:27:05,295
and every single lamp that I own
was on top of my refrigerator.

291
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:08,924
And had a roast in the oven,
which was seasoned to perfection.

292
00:27:08,948 --> 00:27:11,176
It was a fucking good roast.

293
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,679
And I've never made
roast before or after.

294
00:27:13,703 --> 00:27:16,776
So that's something.

295
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,567
Can we talk business?

296
00:27:24,514 --> 00:27:25,449
Yes, of course.

297
00:27:25,474 --> 00:27:26,859
What are you going
to talk about?

298
00:27:26,883 --> 00:27:27,985
I mean, start.

299
00:27:28,009 --> 00:27:31,037
I'd like to know
where we're going.

300
00:27:32,013 --> 00:27:35,316
I just assumed Sam would've
told you that already.

301
00:27:36,601 --> 00:27:37,495
You haven't?

302
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:40,455
What kind of business
partner are you?

303
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:43,116
We're on our way to my
factory in Puerto Rico,

304
00:27:43,483 --> 00:27:46,086
and my lawyers are
waiting for us there

305
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,900
with your contract.

306
00:27:49,363 --> 00:27:50,363
Really?

307
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:51,644
Nothing.

308
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,502
I'm terrible.

309
00:27:54,494 --> 00:27:55,888
I'm a manufacturer.

310
00:27:55,912 --> 00:27:59,123
I have a company that produces
small metal attachments.

311
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:02,269
We make a lot of buttons mostly.

312
00:28:02,293 --> 00:28:04,855
But I've done zippers
in the past as well.

313
00:28:04,879 --> 00:28:08,732
We do military uniforms, some
hospital accouterments, and

314
00:28:09,509 --> 00:28:11,904
a lot of professional attire.

315
00:28:11,928 --> 00:28:13,947
So my plan

316
00:28:13,971 --> 00:28:15,866
to take the equipment
that I already have,

317
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:19,743
make a few small tweaks,
just in a few new molds.

318
00:28:19,977 --> 00:28:22,042
I want to start pumping
out your patent.

319
00:28:22,855 --> 00:28:24,249
This is where it gets
really interesting.

320
00:28:24,273 --> 00:28:26,335
I've already got
the deal in place.

321
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:27,669
It's a licensing contract.

322
00:28:27,693 --> 00:28:30,339
It's gonna make the three of us

323
00:28:30,363 --> 00:28:33,300
about $25 million
How does that sound?

324
00:28:33,324 --> 00:28:37,888
We are about to be on every
piece of clothing in the world.

325
00:28:37,912 --> 00:28:41,124
I want to officially
welcome you to the 1%.

326
00:28:41,165 --> 00:28:43,597
You're an entrepreneur.
Now. Okay.

327
00:28:43,918 --> 00:28:46,670
Your ideas are the ideas
that shape the world.

328
00:28:47,046 --> 00:28:50,533
Our thoughts become
reality. Jen,

329
00:28:51,384 --> 00:28:56,063
I need you to trust me when I
tell you I know how to make money.

330
00:28:56,514 --> 00:28:58,826
And he's got friends
who make missiles.

331
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,202
Tanks.

332
00:29:00,226 --> 00:29:02,246
Actually, that's one friend

333
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,580
I have one friend
that makes things.

334
00:29:03,604 --> 00:29:04,558
It's not that weird.

335
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:06,830
Somebody has to make tanks.

336
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:13,085
So why is the boat,
ship, named Vivie Rae?

337
00:29:13,406 --> 00:29:14,800
Oh, God.

338
00:29:14,824 --> 00:29:16,430
She who shall not be named.

339
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:18,128
His ex-wife.

340
00:29:18,619 --> 00:29:19,805
Vivian.

341
00:29:19,829 --> 00:29:22,169
Actually, was her name.

342
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:25,853
I guess she thought
Vivie Rae sounded

343
00:29:25,877 --> 00:29:29,481
more exotic, whatever.

344
00:29:29,505 --> 00:29:33,176
Anyway, long story short,
my ex-wife had a lot of

345
00:29:34,552 --> 00:29:36,800
mental and emotional

346
00:29:37,763 --> 00:29:40,425
issues, to say the least,

347
00:29:44,478 --> 00:29:45,478
Look,

348
00:29:47,148 --> 00:29:50,169
I want to thank you
all for being here,

349
00:29:50,193 --> 00:29:53,046
for making me a lot of money

350
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,731
and for lifting my spirits.

351
00:29:55,781 --> 00:30:00,278
Cheers.

352
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,706
Hey -Hi.

353
00:30:04,123 --> 00:30:06,268
How far away are you
from Puerto Rico?

354
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:08,219
About three and a half days.

355
00:30:08,711 --> 00:30:10,230
Do you even speak Spanish?

356
00:30:10,254 --> 00:30:15,163
I speak the international language
of cold, hard cash. Mamacita.

357
00:30:27,396 --> 00:30:29,041
Actually, I'm
going to go to bed.

358
00:30:29,065 --> 00:30:30,751
I'm really tired.

359
00:30:30,775 --> 00:30:32,656
But you guys stay up, okay?

360
00:30:32,902 --> 00:30:35,425
Jen, wait wait wait
wait wait, wait on me.

361
00:30:37,281 --> 00:30:38,967
I'm going to go join her.

362
00:30:38,991 --> 00:30:39,633
Okay?

363
00:30:39,951 --> 00:30:40,951
Yeah.

364
00:30:42,745 --> 00:30:43,745
Goodnight.

365
00:30:51,003 --> 00:30:52,003
Wait up

366
00:31:21,325 --> 00:31:25,225
what's the situation
with you two?

367
00:31:25,371 --> 00:31:27,808
Me and David?

368
00:31:27,832 --> 00:31:30,218
No. The other
billionaire on the ship.

369
00:31:30,376 --> 00:31:31,680
- Yeah.
- Shit.

370
00:31:32,503 --> 00:31:35,348
Were you trying to give
me some room up there?

371
00:31:36,382 --> 00:31:38,079
Do you like him?

372
00:31:39,343 --> 00:31:40,343
You're

373
00:31:41,095 --> 00:31:42,031
successful.

374
00:31:42,055 --> 00:31:44,670
Hasn't tried
anything creepy yet.

375
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:47,222
Do you?

376
00:31:50,313 --> 00:31:53,570
You just kissed him.

377
00:31:54,025 --> 00:31:56,712
Plus, I definitely don't want to
have a threesome with you and him.

378
00:31:56,736 --> 00:31:57,796
Oh, my God.

379
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,893
Jen chill, we were
just having some fun.

380
00:32:01,782 --> 00:32:04,177
This is a business trip.

381
00:32:04,201 --> 00:32:08,009
Honestly, you should have
seen him before I met him.

382
00:32:08,664 --> 00:32:11,280
He was such a wreck.

383
00:32:11,334 --> 00:32:12,561
From the divorce?

384
00:32:12,585 --> 00:32:13,777
Yeah,

385
00:32:14,295 --> 00:32:16,231
She must of done a
real number on him.

386
00:32:16,255 --> 00:32:19,109
He doesn't like
to talk about her.

387
00:32:19,133 --> 00:32:21,794
I think he really loved her.

388
00:32:26,098 --> 00:32:29,035
I need to know you
for the right reasons.

389
00:33:03,052 --> 00:33:04,521
One second.

390
00:33:05,221 --> 00:33:06,907
Hey -Hey.

391
00:33:06,931 --> 00:33:08,537
Are you comfortable?

392
00:33:09,183 --> 00:33:10,183
Yeah.

393
00:33:12,812 --> 00:33:13,812
Good.

394
00:33:15,606 --> 00:33:19,047
I just wanted to know if
you get cold at night,

395
00:33:19,402 --> 00:33:22,292
It can get kind of
chilly on the ship.

396
00:33:23,656 --> 00:33:25,675
Um, I'm fine.

397
00:33:25,783 --> 00:33:27,113
Good.

398
00:33:27,868 --> 00:33:28,878
Good.

399
00:33:30,371 --> 00:33:31,563
I'll see you in the morning.

400
00:33:31,747 --> 00:33:33,628
Goodnight -Goodnight.

401
00:35:48,467 --> 00:35:51,403
Jen, Jen? Jen.

402
00:36:58,287 --> 00:37:00,306
Jesus -Sorry.

403
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:03,602
My interrupting?

404
00:37:03,626 --> 00:37:04,865
No.

405
00:37:08,213 --> 00:37:09,314
Sit.

406
00:37:09,715 --> 00:37:11,184
- Are you sleeping okay?
- Yeah.

407
00:37:12,259 --> 00:37:14,278
I'm just a morning person.

408
00:37:20,976 --> 00:37:23,041
Mind if I ask you a question?

409
00:37:29,443 --> 00:37:31,254
What happened in New York

410
00:37:31,278 --> 00:37:33,068
between you and Sam?

411
00:37:34,198 --> 00:37:35,483
What did Sam tell you?

412
00:37:37,493 --> 00:37:38,493
Nothing.

413
00:37:40,496 --> 00:37:41,918
It's just that

414
00:37:42,831 --> 00:37:45,060
if we're going to work together,

415
00:37:45,084 --> 00:37:46,185
which we are.

416
00:37:46,627 --> 00:37:50,065
I want to feel like we
can trust each other too.

417
00:37:50,089 --> 00:37:51,358
If you don't want to talk
about it. That's fine.

418
00:37:51,382 --> 00:37:54,730
I just want you to feel
that you can trust me.

419
00:37:57,596 --> 00:37:58,881
But no pressure.

420
00:38:10,109 --> 00:38:13,871
So, for the last year,
I've been having these

421
00:38:15,114 --> 00:38:16,765
panic attacks.

422
00:38:18,742 --> 00:38:19,650
I don't know.

423
00:38:19,675 --> 00:38:22,795
I think my brain works
differently than other people.

424
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:25,099
Cause you're an artist?

425
00:38:25,582 --> 00:38:27,326
Because you're a thinker?

426
00:38:27,918 --> 00:38:29,708
I don't know about that.

427
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:34,842
No it just got
worse, in New York.

428
00:38:35,843 --> 00:38:38,154
Sam was gone a lot,

429
00:38:38,178 --> 00:38:40,323
hanging out with
her new friends.

430
00:38:40,347 --> 00:38:44,751
And her new friends were more

431
00:38:48,981 --> 00:38:51,137
successful -Ah

432
00:38:52,192 --> 00:38:53,192
like me.

433
00:38:53,569 --> 00:38:54,569
Yeah.

434
00:38:56,447 --> 00:38:57,869
I don't know, I mean, this.

435
00:38:58,198 --> 00:39:00,538
This is great. It's

436
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:04,985
it's just not, really me.

437
00:39:08,459 --> 00:39:09,881
I disagree.

438
00:41:27,139 --> 00:41:29,846
That goes all the way down.

439
00:41:30,851 --> 00:41:32,245
I don't want to think about it.

440
00:41:32,269 --> 00:41:34,655
Well, just don't
think about Jaws.

441
00:41:34,688 --> 00:41:36,339
What's Jaws?

442
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,190
Really?

443
00:41:39,651 --> 00:41:40,651
Huh.

444
00:41:40,986 --> 00:41:43,339
Do sharks actually
attack you here?

445
00:41:43,363 --> 00:41:46,009
Sharks don't come into the
bay this late into the winter.

446
00:41:46,033 --> 00:41:48,970
But the idea is that when you jump in,
make as little a splash as possible.

447
00:41:48,994 --> 00:41:51,055
Because they're
attracted to the motion!

448
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:52,915
You Jerk.

449
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,188
I can't help but
feel like something,

450
00:41:59,212 --> 00:42:02,149
could just pop
out at any moment.

451
00:42:07,262 --> 00:42:08,959
What the fuck!

452
00:42:22,945 --> 00:42:25,881
David? what about the sharks?

453
00:42:26,573 --> 00:42:28,259
I think there's room enough
I this big blue sea for

454
00:42:28,283 --> 00:42:29,944
all God's creatures.

455
00:42:29,969 --> 00:42:30,779
Come jump in.

456
00:42:30,804 --> 00:42:31,997
It's perfect.

457
00:42:38,293 --> 00:42:39,293
Fuck it.

458
00:42:40,253 --> 00:42:41,768
Wait, seriously?

459
00:42:46,885 --> 00:42:47,885
C'mon!

460
00:42:50,138 --> 00:42:51,138
I told you.

461
00:42:59,439 --> 00:43:02,880
- It's so salty.
- I know it's nice.

462
00:43:26,633 --> 00:43:30,405
Jen! Jen. Jen!

463
00:43:30,429 --> 00:43:31,530
You okay?

464
00:43:33,348 --> 00:43:35,918
Quick, quick, just
get out of the water.

465
00:43:36,768 --> 00:43:38,053
You okay?

466
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,416
Are you okay?

467
00:43:39,479 --> 00:43:41,279
Something's down there.
Somethings down there.

468
00:43:43,775 --> 00:43:46,129
Hey! Hey. Hey.

469
00:43:46,153 --> 00:43:48,447
What was it? You see a fish?

470
00:43:49,406 --> 00:43:50,406
Is it Jaws?

471
00:43:50,866 --> 00:43:51,866
What?

472
00:44:13,221 --> 00:44:15,450
Is this not the
best Indian food?

473
00:44:15,474 --> 00:44:16,474
Yeah.

474
00:44:32,949 --> 00:44:35,636
I don't think we
really like this wine.

475
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,771
I'm going to get a
different bottle.

476
00:44:40,207 --> 00:44:41,207
Excuse me.

477
00:44:52,177 --> 00:44:53,416
Sam?

478
00:45:08,443 --> 00:45:10,187
Sam?

479
00:45:13,698 --> 00:45:16,010
I have to go down
to the stockroom.

480
00:45:16,034 --> 00:45:17,548
I'll be right back.

481
00:45:19,579 --> 00:45:22,745
Hey D? Will you grab me a
bottle of white, please?

482
00:45:28,255 --> 00:45:30,732
Sam, I'm sorry about today.

483
00:45:34,261 --> 00:45:37,151
It's like New York
all over again.

484
00:45:38,098 --> 00:45:39,565
What?

485
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:53,359
That's not fair.

486
00:46:03,206 --> 00:46:05,768
White.

487
00:46:05,792 --> 00:46:07,903
Thank you.

488
00:46:33,612 --> 00:46:37,649
- Sam, Stop, hey.
- Hey.

489
00:46:37,782 --> 00:46:40,627
No, this is a bad idea.

490
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,092
This is a bad idea.

491
00:46:44,122 --> 00:46:46,278
What about Jen?

492
00:46:52,047 --> 00:46:53,332
Fuck.

493
00:47:54,609 --> 00:47:56,215
What do you want?

494
00:47:56,528 --> 00:47:57,528
What do you want?

495
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,564
What do you want?

496
00:48:00,699 --> 00:48:02,350
What do you want?

497
00:48:04,577 --> 00:48:06,459
What do you want?

498
00:48:18,174 --> 00:48:20,285
Why are you here?

499
00:48:22,512 --> 00:48:23,843
Why are you here?

500
00:48:42,365 --> 00:48:44,552
Jen? Wake up Jen.

501
00:48:44,576 --> 00:48:46,846
Wait -Jen wake up!

502
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:48,139
Drop the knife Jen!

503
00:48:48,163 --> 00:48:49,390
- What is that?
- Drop it!

504
00:48:49,414 --> 00:48:50,653
Jen wake up!

505
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:51,976
Wake up Jen!

506
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,523
Drop it! Wake up Jen! Wake up!

507
00:48:54,794 --> 00:48:57,648
- Drop the knife. Drop the knife Jen.
- Hey! Hey!

508
00:48:57,672 --> 00:48:59,232
Get off of her!

509
00:48:59,549 --> 00:49:03,403
Hey, hey, hey.

510
00:49:05,263 --> 00:49:07,374
Is she sleep walking?

511
00:49:08,224 --> 00:49:09,368
She probably had a nightmare.

512
00:49:09,392 --> 00:49:10,814
Are you okay? Yeah yeah yeah.

513
00:49:14,814 --> 00:49:16,558
Try to get some rest.

514
00:49:16,608 --> 00:49:17,608
Yeah, You need it.

515
00:49:20,195 --> 00:49:21,571
Sam wait.

516
00:49:21,863 --> 00:49:22,863
Wait.

517
00:49:23,365 --> 00:49:25,567
Can I talk to you?

518
00:49:31,164 --> 00:49:34,789
You know those dreams
I told you about.

519
00:49:36,211 --> 00:49:38,321
You think they're real?

520
00:49:40,382 --> 00:49:41,817
What are you talking about?

521
00:49:41,841 --> 00:49:44,364
I think they happened.

522
00:49:47,972 --> 00:49:51,202
I think if you
had killed Keaton,

523
00:49:51,226 --> 00:49:52,953
we both would know, don't you?

524
00:49:52,977 --> 00:49:54,830
You don't believe me.

525
00:49:54,854 --> 00:49:58,084
Look, I know that the
past couple of months

526
00:49:58,108 --> 00:50:00,906
have been crazy, but.

527
00:50:02,487 --> 00:50:05,424
I don't think it's safe to say
that you've lost your mind, Jen.

528
00:50:05,448 --> 00:50:08,064
I'm seeing things.

529
00:50:08,118 --> 00:50:09,585
It's a figure.

530
00:50:10,537 --> 00:50:11,537
It's like.

531
00:50:11,663 --> 00:50:13,057
It's like this presence.

532
00:50:13,081 --> 00:50:14,683
Jen, stop.

533
00:50:14,707 --> 00:50:17,230
- It's like a black hole.
- Stop it!

534
00:50:18,169 --> 00:50:19,688
I'm trying.

535
00:50:19,712 --> 00:50:22,858
- You need to keep it together.
- I'm trying.

536
00:50:22,882 --> 00:50:24,777
Please, for me.

537
00:50:24,801 --> 00:50:26,270
Okay?

538
00:50:27,637 --> 00:50:30,199
We've come this far already.

539
00:50:30,223 --> 00:50:33,114
Don't fuck this up.

540
00:50:33,268 --> 00:50:34,644
Understood?

541
00:50:34,978 --> 00:50:35,978
Sam.

542
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:40,292
- Goodnight. Sleep good alright?
- Sam, wait?

543
00:50:40,316 --> 00:50:42,336
Goodnight. We'll
talk in the morning.

544
00:50:46,156 --> 00:50:48,217
David, I am.

545
00:50:48,241 --> 00:50:50,489
So sorry.

546
00:50:53,621 --> 00:50:57,429
The subconscious is
a powerful thing.

547
00:50:59,043 --> 00:51:00,354
She's home.

548
00:51:00,378 --> 00:51:03,023
She's missing you. She's scared.

549
00:51:03,047 --> 00:51:05,317
She's alone. Now she's here.

550
00:51:05,341 --> 00:51:08,141
Her life is changing a lot
that can affect people.

551
00:51:09,804 --> 00:51:11,574
I know it's strange, but

552
00:51:11,598 --> 00:51:14,809
human beings are
strange creatures.

553
00:51:15,518 --> 00:51:19,165
I think the best thing we could
do right now is get some sleep

554
00:51:19,189 --> 00:51:20,565
separately.

555
00:51:22,609 --> 00:51:24,170
Did we ruin everything?

556
00:51:24,194 --> 00:51:27,910
No. One bad dream
can't ruin everything.

557
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:31,385
Did I make things,
weird between us though?

558
00:51:31,409 --> 00:51:39,409
Come here. nothing's weird.

559
00:51:40,251 --> 00:51:41,582
Get some sleep.

560
00:51:43,796 --> 00:51:47,925
Goodnight -Goodnight...

561
00:52:24,921 --> 00:52:32,921
Girl, you've been so good to me Stayin'
by my side through the bad times.

562
00:52:36,224 --> 00:52:44,224
All my dreams never came true somehow But
things are gonna be different now, baby.

563
00:52:48,861 --> 00:52:56,861
My ship is comin'
in, baby, baby.

564
00:52:58,162 --> 00:53:06,162
My ship is comin' in.

565
00:53:06,796 --> 00:53:10,776
And won't it be fine?

566
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:18,508
Girl, we're gonna
make it this time

567
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:22,413
you can throw away

568
00:53:22,437 --> 00:53:26,333
that shabby dress, buy yourself.

569
00:53:26,357 --> 00:53:29,844
The finest things in town, girl.

570
00:53:32,822 --> 00:53:38,596
Dry your eyes We're celebrating.

571
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:43,642
Oh, there's so many
good times waiting baby.

572
00:53:43,666 --> 00:53:50,869
My ship is comin'
in, baby, baby.

573
00:54:02,727 --> 00:54:04,746
Let me the fuck out of here!

574
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,624
Hello?

575
00:54:06,648 --> 00:54:08,626

Help!

579
00:54:14,697 --> 00:54:15,707
What the fuck?

580
00:54:16,074 --> 00:54:17,074
Morning.

581
00:54:18,701 --> 00:54:20,353
My door was locked.

582
00:54:20,703 --> 00:54:22,768
Huh? That's weird.

583
00:54:25,583 --> 00:54:27,878
We're gonna have some
breakfast. Come join me.

584
00:54:35,385 --> 00:54:36,715
Found her.

585
00:54:37,136 --> 00:54:38,283
Morning.

586
00:54:38,513 --> 00:54:39,513
Morning.

587
00:54:43,226 --> 00:54:45,978
Yep. Jen!

588
00:54:47,897 --> 00:54:49,319
How are you feeling?

589
00:54:50,066 --> 00:54:51,168
Much better.

590
00:54:51,192 --> 00:54:53,128
- Good.
- Yeah.

591
00:54:53,152 --> 00:54:55,630
I think I just
needed some sleep.

592
00:54:59,242 --> 00:55:01,031
Sam told me

593
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,766
that you were having

594
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:06,382
some sort of bad dream the
night before you came here.

595
00:55:07,375 --> 00:55:08,375
Yeah.

596
00:55:08,626 --> 00:55:10,828
Yeah, it was pretty crazy.

597
00:55:11,087 --> 00:55:12,417
What was that about?

598
00:55:13,548 --> 00:55:15,015
My ex.

599
00:55:15,383 --> 00:55:16,392
Keaton.

600
00:55:17,844 --> 00:55:20,091
He just showed up at my house.

601
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:25,097
I just had a dream that
something happened.

602
00:55:27,061 --> 00:55:28,988
Something like what?

603
00:55:35,319 --> 00:55:36,319
I don't

604
00:55:36,654 --> 00:55:39,361
I don't remember, actually.

605
00:55:42,869 --> 00:55:45,851
I'm really sorry that
that happened to you.

606
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:48,892
All I can tell you is that
you're not going to have to worry

607
00:55:48,916 --> 00:55:50,157
about people like that anymore.

608
00:55:51,002 --> 00:55:51,813
You're gonna have so much money.

609
00:55:51,837 --> 00:55:54,038
You can pay somebody to take
care of him if you need to.

610
00:55:56,966 --> 00:55:57,527
Yeah, I don't know.

611
00:55:57,551 --> 00:56:00,762
I think I was stressed and.

612
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:03,285
I was worried about Sam.

613
00:56:04,474 --> 00:56:08,786
I missed her. felt pretty alone.

614
00:56:11,981 --> 00:56:15,789
I know it's strange, but

615
00:56:16,652 --> 00:56:20,553
human beings are
strange creatures.

616
00:56:25,369 --> 00:56:28,490
All right, I'm
going to go shower.

617
00:56:29,123 --> 00:56:31,693
Still have all this saltwater
in my hair from yesterday.

618
00:56:41,928 --> 00:56:43,350
Excuse me, sir?

619
00:56:45,223 --> 00:56:48,159
- What?
- Could I have a word with you for a moment?

620
00:56:49,185 --> 00:56:50,119
Okay.

621
00:56:50,144 --> 00:56:51,659
Just take a second.

622
00:56:57,443 --> 00:56:58,819
Excuse me.

623
00:57:06,953 --> 00:57:08,639
Some of the crew
have been talking.

624
00:57:08,663 --> 00:57:11,223
We're a little bit concerned about
the situation from last night.

625
00:57:11,749 --> 00:57:13,894
- Yeah.
- I think it would be a good idea

626
00:57:13,918 --> 00:57:17,818
to start the discussion about
finding a place to dock.

627
00:57:19,048 --> 00:57:20,734
No, that's not going to work.

628
00:57:20,758 --> 00:57:23,924
We need to stay on schedule,
so just do your fucking job.

629
00:57:37,608 --> 00:57:39,030
Ladies?

630
00:57:39,986 --> 00:57:42,142
Girls?

631
00:58:00,756 --> 00:58:02,913
Hey Jen?

632
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:10,701
- Sam?!
- Dave! What the fuck?

633
00:58:10,725 --> 00:58:12,452
Sorry

634
00:58:12,476 --> 00:58:14,246
I thought she was
coming for you.

635
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:17,895
What? Jen? Are you crazy?

636
00:58:19,859 --> 00:58:20,670
What's happening?

637
00:58:20,694 --> 00:58:22,253
I have no idea.

638
00:58:24,947 --> 00:58:26,425
- Buddy, stay with me.
- No, Joe!

639
00:58:26,449 --> 00:58:28,844
I need, I need a first
aid kit right now.

640
00:58:28,868 --> 00:58:30,762
Any crew member, I
need a first aid kit.

641
00:58:30,786 --> 00:58:32,556
Joe, Joe, Stay with me,
buddy. Stay with me.

642
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,474
C'mon Joe.

643
00:58:34,498 --> 00:58:35,601
- You alright, you alright.
- Keep talking buddy, keep talking

644
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:37,561
keep on talking buddy,
Keep on talking.

645
00:58:37,585 --> 00:58:39,099
You're going to be all right.

646
00:59:14,789 --> 00:59:17,909
Kiss me -No

647
00:59:18,542 --> 00:59:21,892
Keaton, Keaton no!

648
00:59:22,797 --> 00:59:24,036
Get off!

649
00:59:25,299 --> 00:59:28,695
Hey. Hey.

650
00:59:35,685 --> 00:59:37,932
How long have I been asleep?

651
00:59:38,062 --> 00:59:40,539
Why don't we start
with what you remember.

652
00:59:47,363 --> 00:59:48,877
- What's going on?
- Jen.

653
00:59:49,699 --> 00:59:51,760
- Sam? Sam? Sam?
- Jen, I want you to

654
00:59:51,784 --> 00:59:53,470
Sam, what's happening?

655
00:59:53,494 --> 00:59:54,638
Tell me exactly-

656
00:59:54,662 --> 00:59:57,015
Sam? get these the
fuck off of me!

657
00:59:57,039 --> 01:00:00,251
The best thing you can do right
now is relax and work with me.

658
01:00:00,334 --> 01:00:02,312
Sam what's going on?

659
01:00:02,336 --> 01:00:04,401
Jen, calm down, okay?

660
01:00:04,922 --> 01:00:06,984
She's right, Jen,
you need to relax.

661
01:00:07,008 --> 01:00:08,902
Don't tell me to fucking relax!

662
01:00:08,926 --> 01:00:10,302
Get these the fuck off of me!

663
01:00:11,345 --> 01:00:14,143
Sam. Sam?

664
01:00:15,641 --> 01:00:17,619
Sam, would you give the
two of us a minute, please?

665
01:00:17,643 --> 01:00:19,705
- Sam no.
- Jen, everything's gonna be okay.

666
01:00:19,729 --> 01:00:20,831
Just one minute, Sam.

667
01:00:20,855 --> 01:00:23,041
- No, Sam's don't.
- David she doesn't know anything.

668
01:00:23,065 --> 01:00:24,751
- Sam!
- What happened?

669
01:00:24,775 --> 01:00:26,461
She hasn't remember anything.

670
01:00:26,485 --> 01:00:27,697
What don't I remember?

671
01:00:27,722 --> 01:00:28,809
Watch your hand?

672
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:30,256
Sam, Sam!

673
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:41,518
I need to ask you
some questions.

674
01:00:41,542 --> 01:00:42,542
Okay?

675
01:00:52,511 --> 01:00:58,659
- Do you recognize this woman?
- No.

676
01:01:02,605 --> 01:01:04,256
When did you meet her?

677
01:01:06,067 --> 01:01:07,259
I didn't.

678
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,471
You don't recognize her?

679
01:01:11,072 --> 01:01:13,136
I don't know her.

680
01:01:16,035 --> 01:01:17,971
Where'd you get
that necklace, Jen?

681
01:01:17,995 --> 01:01:19,739
- What?
- Jen.

682
01:01:20,414 --> 01:01:23,018
When did this woman
give you that necklace?

683
01:01:23,042 --> 01:01:25,520
I don't know her, I don't.

684
01:01:25,544 --> 01:01:28,160
I don't know her.

685
01:01:29,381 --> 01:01:31,904
Who gave you the necklace?

686
01:01:38,516 --> 01:01:41,131
Sam.

687
01:01:50,778 --> 01:01:51,925
David.

688
01:01:52,446 --> 01:01:53,822
What's going on?

689
01:01:54,198 --> 01:01:56,802
Look, I really think that we
should dock at that island.

690
01:01:56,826 --> 01:01:59,507
- You know the one I was telling you about?
- Just give me a second.

691
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:01,155
I need to think.

692
01:02:06,168 --> 01:02:10,665
David, there is a dead body
on this ship we have to stop!

693
01:02:10,714 --> 01:02:11,908
David!

694
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:15,565
What are you doing?

695
01:02:19,431 --> 01:02:22,689
Jen told me that you gave
her something in New York.

696
01:02:23,269 --> 01:02:24,691
Where did you get it?

697
01:02:25,771 --> 01:02:26,863
What are you talking about?

698
01:02:26,888 --> 01:02:29,912
I'm talking about her necklace.

699
01:02:30,442 --> 01:02:33,425
From some vintage
shop in Green point.

700
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:40,040
You're lying to me.

701
01:02:43,289 --> 01:02:45,215
Why would you say that?

702
01:02:46,417 --> 01:02:47,311
You said you have Ambien.

703
01:02:47,335 --> 01:02:48,390
Give it to me.

704
01:02:48,961 --> 01:02:52,311
- Why?
- Get me the fucking pills!

705
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,532
When did they get to you?

706
01:03:06,937 --> 01:03:07,880
Hm?

707
01:03:07,905 --> 01:03:10,167
Who gave you the necklace? Who
told you to give it to Jennifer?

708
01:03:10,191 --> 01:03:12,002
Was it before we met?

709
01:03:12,026 --> 01:03:14,412
Was it a coincidence
we met in that bar?

710
01:03:17,323 --> 01:03:20,580
- Was it a coincidence we met that bar?!
- You are insane!

711
01:03:24,455 --> 01:03:28,997
This is every last dime I
have that isn't in assets.

712
01:03:30,085 --> 01:03:32,647
You can consider
it a signing bonus.

713
01:03:32,671 --> 01:03:36,204
I don't know who you're working
with, but I know for a fact

714
01:03:36,592 --> 01:03:38,445
you won't get more money
than working with. But

715
01:03:38,469 --> 01:03:39,799
David, what,

716
01:03:42,514 --> 01:03:44,743
Hi. I'm so sorry
about all of this.

717
01:03:44,767 --> 01:03:45,785
What the fuck is going on?

718
01:03:45,809 --> 01:03:47,454
I know none of
this is your fault.

719
01:03:47,478 --> 01:03:49,831
Lemme help you. But
here's the deal.

720
01:03:49,855 --> 01:03:51,874
Sam!

721
01:04:03,953 --> 01:04:08,642
I need you to relax until
you get this contract signed.

722
01:04:08,666 --> 01:04:11,186
So I have a few pills here
that are going to help you.

723
01:04:11,210 --> 01:04:14,100
And just for a little while,
until we can get to the factory.

724
01:04:14,421 --> 01:04:15,358
All right?

725
01:04:15,382 --> 01:04:17,734
I just need you to
take them and relax.

726
01:04:17,758 --> 01:04:19,945
It's very important
for us. Please.

727
01:04:19,969 --> 01:04:22,405
I need you to trust
me. Do you trust me?

728
01:04:22,429 --> 01:04:23,823
You trust me?

729
01:04:23,847 --> 01:04:25,533
Please, please, please.

730
01:04:25,557 --> 01:04:27,619
I don't like this
any more than you do.

731
01:04:27,643 --> 01:04:28,643
Sam!

732
01:04:30,688 --> 01:04:32,999
I just need you to
take them and relax.

733
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:35,455
It's very important for us.

734
01:04:36,193 --> 01:04:38,716
I'm not going to-Ow!

735
01:04:40,281 --> 01:04:43,308
I'm not gonna be able to let you
breathe unless you take these pills.

736
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:46,265
You understand?

737
01:04:49,248 --> 01:04:50,074
Open.

738
01:04:50,165 --> 01:04:51,017
Open.

739
01:04:51,041 --> 01:04:52,041
Open.

740
01:04:56,046 --> 01:04:58,400
When you swallow, I
can let you breathe.

741
01:04:58,424 --> 01:05:00,402
Swallow. And you can breathe.

742
01:05:00,426 --> 01:05:03,867
Swallow. Do you want some
water? I can get you some water.

743
01:05:08,058 --> 01:05:09,058
Good,

744
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:11,060
good.

745
01:05:12,771 --> 01:05:14,056
Sorry.

746
01:05:14,189 --> 01:05:15,667
This is important.

747
01:05:15,691 --> 01:05:18,086
This is going to be
good for you. I promise.

748
01:05:18,110 --> 01:05:19,046
I just need you to relax.

749
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:20,721
We're going to be there soon.

750
01:05:22,698 --> 01:05:23,698
Okay.

751
01:05:37,588 --> 01:05:44,102
Sam, shit.

752
01:05:51,685 --> 01:05:52,879
Sam?

753
01:07:00,754 --> 01:07:03,650
Hey. Hey,

754
01:07:03,674 --> 01:07:07,803
wake up.

755
01:07:12,224 --> 01:07:14,794
Shit.

756
01:07:22,776 --> 01:07:25,667
Stop fucking around
I'm trying to fix this.

757
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:40,856
Can I help you?

758
01:07:42,963 --> 01:07:44,202
Can you hear me?

759
01:07:46,216 --> 01:07:48,648
You need to go back upstairs.

760
01:07:48,927 --> 01:07:49,927
Hello?

761
01:07:52,764 --> 01:07:53,617
What are you doing?

762
01:07:53,641 --> 01:07:55,751
Help!

763
01:08:18,790 --> 01:08:23,062
Jen Hey,

764
01:08:23,086 --> 01:08:24,508
what are you doing?

765
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:29,255
You feeling all right?

766
01:08:30,802 --> 01:08:34,565
Listen, I'm sorry
about the pills. Jen.

767
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,071
Let's talk about this.

768
01:08:39,478 --> 01:08:41,267
Hey, put that down.

769
01:08:41,813 --> 01:08:46,585
Jen. Jen, put that down. Jen,

770
01:08:48,570 --> 01:08:52,516
Jen. Jen, Jen.

771
01:09:02,182 --> 01:09:03,054
Come on.

772
01:09:03,079 --> 01:09:04,862
I know that's not you.

773
01:09:05,712 --> 01:09:08,282
I know that's not you.

774
01:09:12,636 --> 01:09:14,380
Vivian?

775
01:09:15,973 --> 01:09:18,358
Are you listening to me?

776
01:09:22,312 --> 01:09:24,790
It's just us now.

777
01:09:30,404 --> 01:09:32,055
I never meant

778
01:09:32,155 --> 01:09:33,853
any of this.

779
01:09:38,996 --> 01:09:41,473
You know, I love you.

780
01:09:42,791 --> 01:09:46,920
You're the only thing
I've ever really loved.

781
01:09:50,632 --> 01:09:54,349
You know, I'm lying about that.

782
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:59,033
Please don't do this to me.

783
01:09:59,057 --> 01:10:01,160
I'm sorry.

784
01:10:01,184 --> 01:10:03,800
I'm sorry.

785
01:10:05,564 --> 01:10:09,693
I said I'm sorry.

786
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:16,575
Sorry.

787
01:11:34,236 --> 01:11:39,133
Sam, Sam,

788
01:11:39,157 --> 01:11:40,947
where is everyone?

789
01:11:43,286 --> 01:11:44,847
They're all gone.

790
01:11:52,462 --> 01:11:54,848
They left?

791
01:12:22,534 --> 01:12:25,011
Sam.

792
01:12:31,501 --> 01:12:34,576
It's so good to see you again.

793
01:14:28,243 --> 01:14:31,639
Samantha's told me
so much about you.

794
01:14:31,663 --> 01:14:32,994
She did?

795
01:14:33,748 --> 01:14:36,776
She said she wouldn't have
anything if it wasn't for you.

796
01:14:39,921 --> 01:14:42,812
That she owes you everything.

797
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:51,475
I can see you have
a lot of questions.

798
01:14:52,976 --> 01:14:55,774
I'd like to give
you some answers.

799
01:14:58,648 --> 01:15:00,759
I want to show you something.

800
01:15:02,068 --> 01:15:03,537
Come with me.

801
01:15:20,712 --> 01:15:22,593
Coming?

802
01:16:53,596 --> 01:16:55,294
Where are we?

803
01:16:58,268 --> 01:17:00,424
This is where I grew up.

804
01:17:03,565 --> 01:17:04,620
Do you see?

805
01:17:23,293 --> 01:17:25,449
I chose you.

806
01:17:26,963 --> 01:17:28,707
It's okay.

807
01:18:28,608 --> 01:18:30,030
Jen!

808
01:18:31,361 --> 01:18:32,370
Jen.

809
01:18:34,864 --> 01:18:35,874
Jen.

810
01:18:39,828 --> 01:18:40,828
Just.

811
01:18:40,903 --> 01:18:43,701
I'm sorry. Hey.
