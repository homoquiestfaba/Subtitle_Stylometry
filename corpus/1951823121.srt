00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:35,467
Oh, right. Sorry.

170
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,066
- Your mother sent us to...
- KARSH: What is this?

171
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:41,443
CAMRYN: I drew that this morning.
I have no idea what it is.

172
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:42,981
It's your father's crest.

173
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,983
Our father? Aron?

174
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,781
I've been dreaming about him
every single night.

175
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:52,085
- You... You don't suppose...
- No. No. No.

176
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:55,719
Aron died the night the twins were born.
I know this for a fact.

177
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,195
- So dead.
- BOTH: Dead?

178
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,663
Yeah, gone.

179
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,632
- Did he say... Yeah.
- Did he say dead?

180
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,499
- Uh, of... Of course, Miranda...
- ILEANA: Oh, Miranda!

181
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,037
...will wanna see this.
- That's what we came to tell you.

182
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,097
- Your mother wants to see you, now.
- Now?

183
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,735
Oh. No, no, no, no. Not now.

184
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:16,510
(CHUCKLES) But you're a princess.
You have certain responsibilities.

185
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:19,142
Yeah, and one of them is to make sure
that I'm not late

186
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,708
for my first day of school.

187
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,380
Sorry, but I don't have time
to play princess.

188
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:27,358
It's not playing if you really are one.
Oh, do we get to wear a tiara?

189
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,417
Or a crown?
Will there be a prince involved?

190
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:30,860
I would love a prince.

191
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,694
Look, Your Highness,
you'll have to go without me, okay?

192
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,859
Just tell Mom I'll portal over
as soon as I can.

193
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:40,099
- All right? Bye. What?
- Alex! Good luck.

194
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,200
- You'll do great.
- Thanks. You, too. Bye.

195
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,340
Okay. So that didn't go so well.

196
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,442
Oh, well,
one twitch is better than no twitch.

197
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,310
Really not feeling the love right now.

198
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,912
Ooh, on the way back,
can we stop in the dimension

199
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,581
where everything is made out of sugar?

200
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,354
- I want to look at wedding cakes.
- Oh, that's convenient. Why?

201
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,122
So you can visit your ex-boyfriend,
the dentist?

202
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:06,824
You know what?
Bob is so 23 and a half years ago.

203
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,196
Are you coming?

204
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:11,668
I, uh, I think I'll take my closet.

205
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:15,173
- That would have been a good idea.
- Oh, you think so?

206
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:35,150
Oh, finally. I was getting worried.

207
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,495
I am so relieved to know
that you're safe.

208
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,192
Safe? Why wouldn't I be safe?

209
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,134
We just destroyed Thantos
and the Darkness, right? Right?

210
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,068
Right. Right?

211
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:49,301
Right. Of course,
there's always work to be done.

212
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:50,731
Do you wanna go? Yeah.

213
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,902
MIRANDA: Which is why I was hoping
that you and your sister would help

214
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,674
their poor mother finish
securing her kingdom.

215
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,342
Of course, that begs the question,
where is your sister?

216
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,180
She starts school today.

217
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,345
I'm doing independent study
this semester, so...

218
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,446
So we'll have to make do without her.

219
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,957
Even though I believe I specifically
requested the presence

220
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:10,189
- of both of my daughters.
- See? I told you she'd notice.

221
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:11,923
Look, I'm trying.

222
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:15,831
Well, not that securing the kingdom
doesn't sound like a whole lot of fun,

223
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,699
but when do I get to start princessing?

224
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,467
- Princessing?
- You know. Princessing.

225
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:27,104
Going to balls, riding in carriages,
waving. I'm really good at waving.

226
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:32,677
Oh!

227
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,181
Hi!

228
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:39,315
Well, there won't be too much of that
until you learn to control your magic.

229
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,052
And your walking.

230
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:44,290
Since Ileana is your protector,
she will also be your teacher.

231
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:47,526
But don't worry, I'm a cool teacher.
We can totally have class on the lawn.

232
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,727
If the dragons aren't loose.

233
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,531
Desire? Magdalena?

234
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:56,735
Could you please take my daughter and
see that she is properly princessed up?

235
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,477
Then you can meet Ileana
in the conservatory.

236
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,344
Yeah. Let's start with the tiara, ladies.

237
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:07,884
"Work to do?"

238
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,114
"Secure the kingdom"?
What are you talking about?

239
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:13,420
I don't want to alarm them
until we're certain,

240
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:16,893
but there's something moving
through the Shadowlands.

241
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:20,431
- Something evil.
- Thantos? He's still alive?

242
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,068
But if he regains human form,
the first thing he'll do

243
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,535
- is go after the twins.
- I know.

244
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,765
Use an illuminating spell
to secure the entrances,

245
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,364
then meet me in the dungeons.

246
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:32,205
I want every inch
of this castle searched.

247
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,076
Should I insist
that Alex return to Coventry?

248
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:39,083
(STUTTERING) And by "insist" I mean,
beg, plead and cajole.

249
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:43,886
No. For now, she might actually
be safer in her own dimension.

250
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,327
Just when you think you're gonna get
a little time off.

251
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:56,960
Yeah. You know, it seems like we just
defeated the Darkness yesterday. Huh?

252
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,963
- Back to work.
- Yeah.

253
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,699
You know, to be honest,
I thought we were finally gonna get

254
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,172
a little us time, you know.

255
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:05,574
KARSH: What? 21 years in exile
is not enough us time?

256
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:10,842
<i>(POP MUSIC PLAYING)</i>

257
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:41,279
- What? You can't even say hi?
- Uh, hi.

258
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,644
Come on, don't be that way.

259
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,205
Don't be...

260
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:48,646
Uh, I'm sorry. Hi.

261
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,046
That's better.

262
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:52,949
Hi.

263
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,323
You know, I'm pretty sure
you just said that.

264
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,123
Right. Okay, um,

265
00:14:57,196 --> 00:15:00,097
as fun as this is,
I've got to find McGregor Hall.

266
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,827
I'm sitting in
on a Renaissance poets lecture.

267
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,370
Okay, uh, other side of the quad.

268
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,302
And, you know,
it is good to see you branching out,

269
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,274
'cause I've never really seen you
outside the Art Department.

270
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,333
- Art Department?
- Yeah. Later.

271
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,902
Wait. Um, I know what's going on.

272
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,440
- You're making a huge mistake.
- Maybe, but how about I call you later?

273
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,544
- And I like the new hair. It's nice.
- "I like the hair. It's..." Uh.

274
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:26,614
- MARCUS: Later, Cam.
- Wait! Um, I'm not who you think I am!

275
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,994
- Hmm. No kidding. Hmm.
- Hi.

276
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,553
Of course, I knew it was you the minute
you walked onto campus.

277
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,997
Camryn wouldn't be caught dead
in those jeans.

278
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:38,093
Uh, not that they don't look
totally cute on you.

279
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,797
We're identical, Beth.

280
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,863
And to set the record, I tried to tell him...

281
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,808
Uh-huh. Guess you didn't get off
the Flirt Town Express long enough

282
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,242
to introduce yourself.

283
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,609
I don't even know who he is.

284
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,444
Marcus Warburton,
your sister's ex-boyfriend.

285
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:54,475
Yeah, emphasis on the "ex" part.
She broke up with him two weeks ago.

286
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:58,421
- We don't talk to him anymore.
- She broke up with him? Huh.

287
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,521
But he's so...

288
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:04,187
(SIGHING) Knowledgeable
about campus geography.

289
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,525
Hmm.

290
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:10,000
Oh, look, there's McGregor Hall.
Right where he said it was. See ya.

291
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:14,199
Oh, and, uh, don't worry.
I won't say a word to Camryn about this.

292
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:19,639
(SIGHING) But I do plan on texting her
every single detail.

293
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,507
Now, this is what I'm talking about.

294
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,451
(GASPING) Magic books!
Someone did write it all down.

295
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,523
Doesn't look so hard.

00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,871
Oh! Oh! Thanks.

No problem. Here you go.

300
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:02,245

All right, all right. Look.
You're just trying too hard, all right?

304
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,892
Just picture what you want
to have happen, all right?

305
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,126
- And let it flow through you.
- Hmm.

306
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,134
- You ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

307
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:22,703
- Thanks.
- No problem.

308
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,810

in my parents' garage.

- I'm Demetri.
- Are you a prince?

- I prefer not to use titles.
- I'm Camryn.

311

Oh, everyone knows who you are.
Welcome to Coventry.

She's probably looking...

00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:51,099
Okay, now, that's gonna be tricky
because I talk with my hands a lot.

316
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,799
Oh, it just takes some getting used to.
But, don't worry about that, I'll, uh,

00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:57,239
- I'll clean it up for you.
- Oh, thanks again.

- Look.

"I prefer not to use titles?"

There's no reason I can't talk to her.

No reason except for the fact that
you broke, like, 1,400 laws.

I was expecting, though.

No, me neither. I think she liked me.

00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,951
Oh! Hi. Um, I was hoping
I was gonna see you again.

333
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:51,988
Look, there's been
a huge misunderstanding.

334
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:55,727
I know this is gonna sound...
You just called me Alex.

335
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,530
Yeah. Yeah. That's your name, isn't it?

336
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:01,630
Well, yeah, but, um. Beth got to you.

337
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,766
(CHUCKLING) Got to me?

338
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,503
She basically tackled me
in the cafeteria.

339
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:08,512
But, other than that, I did know
something was different.

340
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,774
And not just the hair.

341
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,476
Well, apparently, my sister's
very popular around here.

342
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,382
- Yeah.
- So far, I've been invited

343
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:17,320
to seven parties and asked out twice.

344
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,625
Okay, so why don't we make that
three times, then?

345
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,252
- You feel like getting something to eat?
- Wha...

346
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:27,355
Sorry, but that has bad idea
written all over it. Yeah.

347
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,923
Okay, um, well,
if it makes any difference,

348
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,697
one of the reasons your sister and I
broke up is 'cause

349
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,170
we really just didn't have
much in common.

350
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,672
Well, it doesn't make a difference.

351
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,835
It just means I'll be borrowing
your notes.

352
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,435
- See ya.
- Okay.

353
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,013
Uh, hey, uh, Alex! Wait!

354
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,151
Why don't you let me walk you home?

Didn't we just play
two rounds of this game?

356
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,066
Yeah, I... You know, I just wanna
make sure you're safe, right.

357
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,227
And besides, Camryn would never
forgive me if I let anything

He'll be fine-ish.

495
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:45,946
But his shadow? Not so fine-ish.

496
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,692
His shadow?

497
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,093
- Shadows exist on their own here?
- Oh, yes. Yeah.

498
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:55,929
It's in that world,
the world of the Shadows,

499
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,333
that Thantos is hiding
and plotting his return.

500
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,895
I just hope we're not too late.

501
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:06,069
"Too late"?
What does she mean, "Too late"? Oh!

502
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,411
- They're doomed.
- Oh, yeah.

503
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,779
Too late to stop him
from regaining his human form.

504
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,050
Why? What happens then?
It's bad, right?

505
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:18,078
I can tell it's going to be bad.

506
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:22,354
He's got one purpose and one purpose
only, to destroy the two of you.

507
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,655
Yeah.

508
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:27,529
Yeah, that would fall underneath
the category of bad.

509
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:34,996
If Thantos does come back, I doubt we'll
be able to stop him a second time.

510
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,734
CAMRYN: Wait!

511
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:39,606
That's what I saw standing over you
this morning.

512
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:44,774
It wasn't a man, it was a shadow
of a man. Thantos was in our house!

513
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:46,578
- No, he wasn't.
- (WHISPERING) Yes, he was!

514
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:47,845
ALEX: Wasn't!
CAMRYN: Yes, he was!

515
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,319
If he can freely travel
between the two worlds,

516
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:51,980
then he's already stronger
than we feared.

517
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:53,819
ALEX: What is up with you
and this Shadow business?

518
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,757
- It was not in the Shadows.
- CAMRYN: Yes, it was!

519
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,524
MIRANDA: But I'm afraid
that once again, you two

520
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,564
are the only ones that can stop him.

521
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,259
ALEX: Us? Why us?

522
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,460
Why can't they do some
of the heavy pointing for a change?

523
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:07,300
- (LAUGHS) No offense.
- None taken.

524
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:10,808
But it is a good question.
They never do anything.

525
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,775
Well, okay, some taken.

526
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:22,976
In two days, the sun and the moon
will be in perfect alignment.

527
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,420
A solar eclipse?

528
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,982
And both of you
will be at your most powerful.

529
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,528
Well, I always wanted
a solar eclipse wedding. Please?

530
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:33,587
Well, you know my mother
can't be here in two days.

531
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,428
Oh, that's right. Pretty please?

532
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,024
- No! Yes!
- Are you sure there's no way...

533
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,501
I need them
to perform the Vanquishing Spell.

534
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:43,337
Well, that's not possible.
They can't do a Vanquishing Spell.

535
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:46,377
They're still at wall-walking.
Remedial wall-walking.

536
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:47,468
(WHISPERING) There was an incident.

537
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:49,410
In fact, stuck in the wall
is more accurate.

538
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,539
I don't think we have any other choice.

539
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:54,585
- But they're not ready.
- Then get them ready.

540
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,155
Uh, hey, shouldn't it be up to us
whether we perform

541
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:00,714
- this Vanquishing Spell or not?
- CAMRYN: Yeah.

542
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,453
- What is it?
- ILEANA: It's a spell so powerful

543
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:06,327
that it'll destroy anything
that's hidden in the Shadowlands.

544
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:13,097
ALEX: But if we do that spell, it will
vanquish Dad's shadow. We can't do it.

545
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:15,069
Excuse me?

546
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:19,803
I found it today in the North Tower.
It was Dad's, wasn't it?

547
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:23,439
I think he's trying to communicate
with us. He's alive.

548
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:25,846
I think he's in the Shadowlands.

549
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:33,013
I am so sorry.

550
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:37,459
I know you don't want to believe this,
but your father's gone.

551
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,227
He's not coming back.

552
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:44,792
I searched for years
through the Shadows. He's not there.

553
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:49,696
- But... But my stories, my dreams...
- Are the work of Thantos.

554
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,209
The moon is half in darkness.

555
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,575
You have a connection
to the Shadowlands. He's using you.

556
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:57,240
But the ring? What about Aron's ring?

557
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:02,379
Only Thantos could have Aron's ring.
He took it from him when he killed him.

558
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:06,947
But it's not Thantos. I know it's not.
It's Aron, our father.

559
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:10,791
- He needs our help.
- No, we need your help.

560
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:16,291
I'm sorry, but on this,
you're just gonna have to trust me.

561
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:19,029
Now, I'm counting on you
and your sister.

562
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,799
The future of Coventry depends on you.

563
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:28,175
(SIGHING) It's amazing this place
ever got along without us.

564
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:32,410
MIRANDA: Prepare for the spell.
KARSH: Yes, my Queen.

565
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:44,819
All right. Now.

566
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,956
Now, the most important aspect
of the Vanquishing Spell

567
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,059
is getting the proportions correct.

568
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,969
It's a very delicate balance.

- Okay. So, as I was saying...
- What?

580
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,897
...the most important part of
the Vanquishing Spell is to have the...

581
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:32,136
Okay, what do you say we just jump in
and get right to it?

582

All this talk-talk
never pulled a rabbit out of a hat.

No, but it does help prevent small
villages from turning into donkeys.

584

I said I was sorry.

585
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:42,142
KARSH: Oh, and I suppose it's
no coincidence that that village

586
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,085
- happened to be my mother's.
- BOTH: Oh.

587
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,679
Kind of sorry.

it's all about balance.

Equal part sun, equal part moon,
equal part...

- Okay. I think they got it.
...hot, equal part cold.

592
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,660

it matters whether you agree or not.

Yeah, he's great.

660
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:33,983
Uh, well, look, I should probably
leave the two of you to save the world.

661
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:35,712
But, listen, um, I was wondering

662
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:37,117
if I could show you
around the gardens sometime?

663
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,656
Yes! I mean, yes.

664
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,721
That would be a yes.

665
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:46,854
KARSH: Oh, look, there you are!
Can I get some tea, please?

666
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,990
ILEANA: And could I get one of those
chicken salad sandwiches

667
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:50,465
with the crust cut off?

668
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:53,833
Ooh, and some olives. Hmm.
I love me the olives.

669
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,140
- Well?
- Right away, sir.

670
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,807
KARSH: Hey, where's your apron?
Put your apron on.

671
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:06,044
Wow, things have really slipped
since we went into exile.

672
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,106
Hmm.

673
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:08,674
You guys should probably
order something, too.

674
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,880
We're gonna be working late.

675
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:13,451
You're not a prince?

676
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:15,685
(SIGHING) No.

677
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:18,652
I... Excuse me.

678
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:23,664
Cam, what's the matter with you?
Go after him.

679
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:25,725
He's working. I don't...

680
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:29,069
We should probably get back
to the spell.

681
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,200
ALEX: You're impossible. Demetri!

682
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,507
Demetri!

683
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:39,238
Hey, Demetri.

684
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:41,818
- MAN: Hail, your Divinity.
- Demetri, I want to talk.

685
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:43,080
- WOMAN: Princess Artemis.
- Princess Alex.

686
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,850
Okay, you guys have
got to stop doing that.

687
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,982
Okay, look, I'm sorry. Okay?
Please, don't be mad, all right?

688
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:50,619
I didn't lie to her. Granted, I completely
didn't tell her the truth, but I didn't lie.

689
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:53,687
No, no. It's okay.
Calm down. Nobody's mad.

690
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:58,065
I just wanted to impress her, you know,
I just... I want her to like me.

691
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:02,572
Even though you're a waiter it does
not mean you cannot be impressive.

692
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,373
I've cleaned people's houses,
toilets included, for two summers.

693
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:08,969
- Really?
- Well, hey,

694
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:10,638
you gotta do what you gotta do.

695
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,740
But your job doesn't define who you are.

696
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:15,342
Well, no, of course not.
Who your parents are does.

697
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:17,444
And, again, no.

698
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,183
Okay, I'm sorry. Are you sure
you're a princess? 'Cause...

699
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,248
Well, I'm kind of new at it.
Just give me a few more weeks

700
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:25,420
and I promise to be
way more stuck-up and snotty.

701
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:29,592
And Camryn, well, she likes you.

702
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:34,399
- So don't give up. Okay?
- Okay.

703
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:38,632
- Actually, can I ask you a favor?
- Sure. Anything.

704
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,075
Can I borrow some of your magic?

705
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:45,339
My magic? Why would you want that?

706
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:48,911
Well, so I can do something
special for Camryn.

707
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:51,853
- Well, don't you have any of your own?
- No.

708
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:54,822
Oh, okay. Well, then...

709

(DEMETRI SCREAMING)

711
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,127
- What happened?
- Are you all right?

712
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:03,860
It was Thantos. I know it.
He tried to take over Demetri's shadow.

713
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:06,368
- Well, where is he now?
- He's in there.

714
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:08,132
- Where?
- In there.

715
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:12,833
- Where? There?
- He's in there.

716
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:17,875
- Ah. He's in there.
- KARSH: Ah!

717
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:22,549
But I didn't know what else to do.

718
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,487
He asked to borrow my magic
to impress Cam.

719
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,218
- Uh-huh?
- Oh, come on.

720
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,418
Only Thantos
would ask something like that.

721
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:32,656
This is Coventry.
Everyone has magic, right?

722
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,426
I'm afraid that's not entirely true.

723
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:38,866
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Uh, I could use a chiropractor.

724
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,238
You... You see, after your father was
killed, your mother thought

725
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:44,706
it would be best to leave magic
in the hands of those

726
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,265
who could best control it.

727
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:50,245
Uh, like the royal family
and your protectors.

728
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:51,645
- That's us.
- Mmm-hmm.

729
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:54,479
- They took everyone's magic?
- KARSH: Hmm.

730
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:56,417
That's horrible. That's so unfair.

731
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:58,955
Uh, Alex, I really don't think
you understand...

732
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:01,423
No, no. I understand just fine.

this morning, and she was gone.

I was getting so worried!

- Duh!

doing the Marcus whoop-de-doo.

They're just going over notes.

746

(SCOFFS) I mean, no giggling,
no hair-flipping. She's really bad at this.

00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,302
Thanks. You're a good friend.

748
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,842
Uh, well, apparently not good enough
for you to text me back.

749
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:56,504
I have blisters!

750
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:00,413
I think I should be telling you
what to do.

- I'm... I'm trying, okay.
- Okay. I think I gotta go.

- Later.

(SIGHING) Hey, Marcus.
It's me, Alex, again.

759
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:38,455
I can see that. Um, what happened?

760
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:40,114
I thought you had studying to do.

761
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,715
I do? Oh! I do.

762
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,927
So many books by dead people to read.

Um, but before I go, I was wondering,
you know my sister, Camryn?

764
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:53,897
Really pretty, you used to date.
What do you think of her?

Okay. That's a little random.
Um, I don't know.

00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,508
She's great, I mean she's fun.

- I am not self-centered!

(GASPS) Aren't these
just the cutest shoes?

I wouldn't say that! I wouldn't say that.

And that only works if those shoes
are actually cute.

- Well, they're your shoes.
- What are you even doing here?

so I wouldn't look bad.

would have run from Coventry,

Why do you think he's only
communicating with me?

801

He gave me the ring.

00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:23,342
Which, you have to say,
isn't the worst idea in the whole...

825
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,741
Alex?

826
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:29,646
Alex? Remember when I said
there was an incident?

827
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:31,545
Well, Ileana...

828
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:37,551
I don't know about this.

829
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,619
Don't you suppose they bricked this up
for a reason?

830
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:43,291
Yup, and I want to know
what that reason is.

831
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:45,301
- Just stay close.
- Wait!

832
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,359
You know when you go
to a horror movie

833
00:46:47,437 --> 00:46:49,997
and there's always that stupid girl
who goes inside the creepy house

834
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:52,303
even though there are a gazillion signs
saying, "Keep Out"

835
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:54,503
and the whole audience is screaming,
"Don't go in there"?

836
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:57,411
- Yeah?
- (WHISPERING) You're that girl.

837
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,346
Wha... What was that?

838
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:01,077
Nothing. Just a shadow.

839
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,413

844
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:22,937
Isn't there a spell
you should be studying?

845
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:25,201
- Well...
- Uh...

846
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:28,267
We were just, you know,
checking out the new place, and, uh...

847
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,176
- Yeah.
- I have to say,

848
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:31,646
you could use
a couple more bathrooms.

849
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:34,707
- Yeah.
- Uh, Cam drew this.

850
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:37,446
I used to draw all the time
when I was your age.

851
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,079
But don't you think it's kind of strange?

852
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:41,021
It would be stranger if you hadn't.

853
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:43,685
Thantos is many things,
but he's not a fool.

854
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,354
He's purposely trying to deceive you.

855
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:51,297
This is Dad's study, isn't it?

856
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:53,636
Yes, it was.

857
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:57,368
It was his favorite place
in the whole castle.

858
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:00,668
It's just like he left it.

859
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:03,736
What was he like?

860
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:06,339
Please? You never talk about him.

861
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:10,312
I don't know where to begin.

862
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:16,125
He was funny and sweet and strong.

863
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:19,825
<i>I was just about your age
when I met him at the Winter Festival.</i>

864
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,804
<i>We ended up dancing
the whole night together.</i>

865
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:36,337
And when it was over,
he said he wanted to give me a present,

866
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,813
so I would remember him forever.

867
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:42,549
I could pick whatever I wanted.

868
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,610
What did you ask for?

869
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:47,452
A star from the north sky.

871
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,928
- It's a real star.
- Good gift.

873
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:00,667
I never told anyone that story.

874
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:02,966
It was our secret.

875
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,669
All right, it's getting late.
You should get home.

876
00:49:07,744 --> 00:49:08,768
Bye, Mom.

877
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:13,612
I think I'll sleep a little easier knowing
you're safe in your own dimension.

I know you're struggling.

879

It's not Thantos who's been coming
to me. It's Dad. I know it.

I know that you believe that.
But you're just gonna have to trust me.

Okay.

telephone in this magical land of yours?

890
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,369
Sorry.

891
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:18,914
Yesterday, you go slog off in that
swimming pool and you can't call?

892
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:20,449
I took the closet, I'm sorry.

893
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,109
Your... Your mother
has been worried sick.

894
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:24,016
Actually, your mother's just fine.

895

But your father, well,
he drained the pool.

I'm sorry, Daddy. I still haven't mastered
inter-dimensional communication.

download, and talk on the cell phone

No.

Is there something that you're not telling
us, because you know that

we'll freak out and there's a chance
your father's head will explode?

991
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:33,614
Oh, look. There's one now.

992
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:37,319
Alex, the eclipse
is almost upon us. Wait!

993
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,830
- (WHISPERING) That was awkward.
- (WHISPERING) Yup.

994
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:50,102
Someday she's gonna understand.

995
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,900
We don't have much time
before the eclipse. Where's Camryn?

996
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:57,344
At home. Well, her other home.
With her parents. Her other parents.

997
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:01,612
Mom. Mother. The other mother, is...
She's not here.

998
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:03,447
- Would you find her, please?
- Oh, yeah.

999
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,681
Ask her to talk to her sister.

1000
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,588
- We need them both here.
- Yes. We're on it.

1001
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,451
On the way there, could we stop
so I can change my shoes?

1002
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:12,790
I think they match perfectly.

1003
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:15,057
I have to talk to her?
Why do I have to talk to her?

1004
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:16,155
Because you're her sister.

1005

1006
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:18,426
She'll listen to you.

1007
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:20,059
Have either of you met Alex?

1008
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:22,468
She's not so good on the listening
or the sistering.

1009
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:25,906
And she took my lip gloss.
Oh, she's such a little...

1010

Oh, there it is.

we don't have much time left.

1012
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,078

of the Shadowlands, we're defenseless.

1013

Uh, but Miranda she's...

1014
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:37,742
Miranda is still too weak from
her last battle with the Darkness.

1015
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:39,846
CAMRYN: Uh...
ILEANA: And too proud to say so.

1016

of stopping him.

I wanna do what's right.

1021
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:56,798
- I just don't know what the right thing is!
- ILEANA: I think you do.

1022
00:57:56,873 --> 00:58:01,708
You are a princess of Coventry.
You can't just sit back and do nothing.

1023
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:04,508
You have to act. You have to govern.

1024

I'm sorry if that's not what you thought
princessing was, but it is.

- Whoa, tough love.
- Thank you.

1026
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:13,010
- Yeah.
- ILEANA: Oh, yeah.

1027
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:17,753
Look, it's not what I thought it would be,
but, I like it.

1028

I like having responsibility, and I like
having my life be about something.

- Love the tiara!

1030

So you'll help?

1031
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:30,804

I'll make sure she's there.

quite a bit of dust in Twin Town.

somewhere, and Alex isn't budging.

You? You're way over there
in no-sense land.

ALEX: Okay, then something definitely
must be wrong,

1052

if you think you're the sensible one.

1053

this isn't happening?

in my power to try and help him.

supposed to do that?

(ALEX GRUNTING)

1319
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:57,574
- Dad!
- No!

1320
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:01,581
Stay back!

1321
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:05,525
Ooh, gladly.
It's too late for you to do anything now.

1322
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:08,058
He has nothing left.

1323
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:17,599
Now, I know you'll never understand.

1324
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:24,040
With us here, he has everything left.

1325
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:45,427
ALL: "We give you everything."

1326
01:16:58,313 --> 01:16:59,371
No!

1327
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:04,846
(THANTOS GRUNTS)

1328
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:17,190
Dad!

1329
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:24,135
Thank you. Thank you.

1330
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:38,712
(GROWLING)

1331
01:17:40,355 --> 01:17:41,754
Watch out!

1332
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,757
(THANTOS SCREAMING)

1333
01:17:56,938 --> 01:17:58,405
BOTH: Loser.

1334
01:18:12,954 --> 01:18:14,683
(ARON CHUCKLING)

1335
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,494
You were right. This kind of bond is
something he could never understand.

1336
01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:34,598
KARSH: Hello!
ILEANA: Hey! How's it going up there?

1337
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:37,173
- KARSH: A little help, please!
- Hi!

1338
01:18:37,245 --> 01:18:38,337
(ARON LAUGHING)

1339
01:18:38,413 --> 01:18:40,938
Seriously, we don't have a flying spell!

1340
01:18:41,016 --> 01:18:44,144
Come to think of it, we don't...
We don't have a landing spell, either!

1341
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:47,052
I don't know how long
this gargoyle can hold us.

1342
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:48,054
(BELLS TOLLING)

1343
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:54,057
And do you, Karsh, take the lovely
Ileana to be your lawful wedded wife?

1344
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:00,497
I do! Yeah, absolutely.

1345
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:01,627
(ALL LAUGHING)

1346
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:04,001
ARON: And do you Ileana
take the handsome Karsh...

1347
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:07,530
You look great.
Oh, you know you love it.

1348
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:10,438
Yeah, you're right. I kind of love it.

1349
01:19:10,512 --> 01:19:12,412
ILEANA: Of course I do.

1350
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:15,712
ARON: Well, we certainly got lucky with
the weather, didn't we, everyone?

1351
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:18,548
I just wanna say, uh,
does anyone have any objections

1352
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:19,644
(DONKEY BRAYING)

1353
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:20,779
As to whether the lovely Ileana...

1354
01:19:20,856 --> 01:19:23,324
I know.
They grow up so fast, don't they?

1355
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,483
(BRAYING)

1356
01:19:24,559 --> 01:19:25,719
I hear you.

1357
01:19:25,794 --> 01:19:27,625
Well, may we have
the rings now, please?

1358
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:30,927
- Oh, yes.
- BOTH: You are my favorite.

1359
01:19:30,999 --> 01:19:32,159
CAMRYN: Oh.

1360
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:36,500
I can't believe you're not more
freaked out about this.

1361
01:19:36,571 --> 01:19:39,369
What is there to be freaked out about?

1362
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:41,306
(SIGHING) I'm just jealous
she has this much space

1363
01:19:41,376 --> 01:19:43,503
in the back of her closet.

1364
01:19:50,018 --> 01:19:51,042
Aw.

1365
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:54,054
- We now pronounce you husband...
- And wife.

1366
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:55,282
Okay.

1367
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:01,693
You may now kiss the bride.

1368
01:20:01,763 --> 01:20:04,288
Oh! Right! Okay. Okay.

1369
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:06,632
- We shouldn't go head on...
- Why?

1370
01:20:06,701 --> 01:20:08,532
Because our noses are not helping.

1371
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:10,036
- What? No, did you say it was big?
- No, no, no.

1372
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:11,367
- ILEANA: Are you sure? You don't?
- I don't think it's big.

1373
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:13,430
No, not at all. I just...

1374
01:20:13,508 --> 01:20:14,497
BOTH: (WHISPERING) Kiss her.

1375
01:20:14,576 --> 01:20:17,101
Uh, okay, okay. Okay.

1376
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:19,170
(ALL CHEERING)

1377
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:20,839
(DONKEY BRAYING)

1378
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:26,550
- Rose petals?
- Yeah, I know. Disgusting.

1379
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:27,645
It was the twins' idea.

1380
01:20:27,722 --> 01:20:29,417
I can't believe
you did that to my mother.

1381
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:32,289
I don't think she's ever looked lovelier.

1382
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:40,926
- That was lovely.
- No, that was weird.

1383
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:44,494
No, David. How could you say that?
Yes, that was weird.

1384
01:20:58,019 --> 01:20:59,145
No, no, I got it.

1385
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:01,382
- No wait. You... But your...
- No, I need.

1386
01:21:01,456 --> 01:21:04,653
Mrs. Karsh and I
are going to start a book club.

1387
01:21:05,927 --> 01:21:08,794
Well, you finally know
how your fairytale ends.

1388
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:12,527
- I never doubted it had a happy ending.
- You so doubted it.

1389
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:14,262
You were like the princess of doubt.

1390
01:21:14,336 --> 01:21:15,928
- What?
- Yes.

1391
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:17,028
- Me?
- Mmm-hmm.

1392
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:19,437
- No, that was you.
- So not true.

1393
01:21:20,942 --> 01:21:23,274
- Your tiara slipped.
- ALEX: Oh.

1394
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:24,771
(GIGGLING)

1395
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:31,349
- Ah, well. I think we look fabulous.
- You think?

1396
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:32,647
Mmm-hmm.

1397
01:21:34,689 --> 01:21:37,419
BOTH: Go, twitches! Go, twitches!

1398
01:21:37,492 --> 01:21:39,619
ALL: Go, twitches! Go, twitches!
