1
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,520
They say most of your brain
shuts down in cryo-sleep.

2
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,840
All but the primitive side...

3
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
...the animal side.

4
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,760
No wonder I'm still awake.

5
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,720
Transporting me with civilians.

6
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,640
Sounded like 40, 40-plus.

7
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,400
Heard an Arab voice.
Some hoodoo holy man.

8
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,120
Probably on his way to New Mecca.

9
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,560
But what route?
What route?

10
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,320
Smelled a woman.

11
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,320
Sweat, boots, tool belt, leather.
Prospector type.

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,400
Free settlers.

13
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,080
And they only take the back roads.

14
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,640
And here's my real problem:

15
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,120
Mr. Johns, blue-eyed devil.

16
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,560
Planning on taking me back to slam...

17
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,040
...only this time he picked a ghost lane.

18
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,240
A long time between stops.

19
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,240
A long time for something to go wrong.

20
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,720
Why did I fall on you?

21
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,520
He's dead.
Captain's dead.

22
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,880
I was looking right at him.

23
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,120
The chrono shows we are 22 weeks out.

24
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,840
So gravity was not supposed to 
kick in for another 19--

25
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,320
-Why did I fall at all?
-Did you hear what I said?

26
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,840
Captain's dead.

27
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,920
1,550 millibars.

28
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,800
Dropping 20 mb per minute--Shit!

29
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,000
We're hemorrhaging air.
Something took a swipe at us.

30
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,680
Just tell me we're still
in the shipping lane.

31
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,760
Just show me all those stars.
Come on! Those big, bright--

32
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,500
What?

33
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,200
This is an emergency dispatch from 
merchant vessel, Hunter Gratzner,

34
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,500
en route to the Tangiers system

35
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,000
with 40 commercial passengers on board.

36
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,750
We have been knocked out of our
shipping lane and are currently

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,440
entering the atmosphere of a planetary
body in the following position:

38
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,000
X-38-stroke-5
Y-95-stroke-8, Z-21--

39
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,560
Fry, where the hell's our comms?

40
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,700
Rate of descent beyond known limits.
Rate of descent beyond--

41
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,400
Hey, they trained you for this
Fry, right?

42
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,120
Deploy lower air brakes now.

43
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,760
-Deploy lower air brakes now.
-Center of gravity too far aft.

44
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,240
Recommend purging ballast now.

45
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,640
What the....
Was that a purge, Fry?

46
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,960
Too heavy in the ass!

47
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,800
Can't get my fucking nose down!

48
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,280
Crisis program selected Number 2 in
the system because it shows some oxygen.

49
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,360
Maximum terrain:
220 meters over mean surface...

50
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,800
...largely cinder and gypsum
with some evaporite deposits.

51
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,960
Fry, what the hell are you doing?

52
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,240
I gotta drop more load.

53
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,360
Look, I tried everything else.
I still got no horizon.

54
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,840
You gotta try everything twice 'cause
no way that we just flush out the--

55
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,880
Look,  If you know something I don't, get
your ass up here and take the chair or--.

56
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,680
Listen, company says we are responsible
for every single one of those people, Fry.

57
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,920
What, we both die
out of sheer fucking nobility?

58
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,960
Don't you touch that handle, Fry!

59
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,240
I'm not gonna die for them!

60
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,160
-Air lock doors not secure.
-Owens!

61
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,920
70 seconds, Fry! You still have
70 seconds to level this beast out!

62
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
-damnit! shit! SHIT!! SHIT!!!
-Air lock doors not secure--

63
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Air lock doors not secure.
Air lock--

64
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,720
What the fuck is happening up there?

65
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,400
-Imam? ...Imam?
-...Zeke?

66
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,040
Somebody's gonna get hurt
one of these days.

67
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,920
It ain't gonna be me.

68
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,800
Here, Shazza.

69
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,520
So, I guess something went wrong.

70
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,680
I'm sorry.

71
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,640
Get it out of me!

72
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,400
Don't touch it!
Don't--Don't you touch that handle!

73
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,200
-Leave it alone.
-Get it out of him.

74
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,480
No, No, No.
It's too close to his heart.

75
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,640
There's some Anestaphine in the med-lock
in the back of the cabin.

76
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,760
Not anymore there's not.

77
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,720
Get out of here.
Everyone.

78
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,880
Get out of here.

79
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,160
Teach me for flying coach.

80
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,400
Interesting.

81
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,920
Is anyone else
having difficulties breathing?

82
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,520
Yeah. I feel one lung short.
All of us.

83
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,840
I feel like I just ran or something.

84
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,120
There was talk of a scouting party looking
for other people, but--then we saw this.

85
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,480
What the bloody hell happened?

86
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,720
Could have been a meteor storm.
Might have been a rogue comet.

87
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,280
-I don't know.
-Well, I for one am thoroughly grateful.

88
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,920
This beast wasn't made
to land like this, but...

89
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,920
...I think you did well.

90
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,080
Actually, the only reason
we're alive is because of her.

91
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,360
Yes, I suppose you're right.
Thanks very much.

92
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,880
Yeah.
Thanks for saving our dicks.

93
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,320
No, really.
Thanks awfully.

94
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,200
Well done.

95
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,040
He just escaped from a maximum prison.

96
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,160
So, do we just keep him locked up forever?

97
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,280
Well, that would be my choice.

98
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,800
-Is he really that dangerous?
-Only around humans.

99
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,720
I'll bet the whole container's upside
down, it's all--it's all topsy-turvy.

100
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,320
Well, thank goodness
it's not a total loss.

101
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,640
Booze?
This is what you have to drink?

102
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,880
I'm gonna need a receipt for that.
For all of these. This is my personal stuff.

103
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,800
I don't suppose this will help you at all.

104
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,440
Unfortunately, it is not permitted.
Especially while on Hajj.

105
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,640
-You realize there's no water, don't you?
-All deserts have water.

106
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,800
-It only waits to be found.
-I hope you're right.

107
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,840
All the more for me then.

108
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,040
Motherfucker.

109
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,800
What the hell are these?

110
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,880
They're Maratha crow-bill war Picks
from Northern India. Very rare.

111
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,880
And this?

112
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,960
That's a hunting blow-dart pipe
from Northern Papua New Guinea.

113
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,800
And that's very, very rare,
since the tribe is now extinct.

114
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,680
'Cause they couldn't hunt shit with
these things, would be my guess.

115
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,500
Well then, what's the point, anyway?
I mean, If the man is gone, he's gone.

116
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,500
-Why should he bother us?
-Maybe to take what you got...

117
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,760
...Maybe to work your nerves.

118
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,080
Or maybe he'll just come back
and skull-fuck you in your sleep.

119
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,440
Sounds like a charmer.

120
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,320
For you.

121
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,720
There we go.

122
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,250
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

123
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,480
Imam! If we're looking for water,
we should leave soon.

124
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Before nightfall, while it's cooler.

125
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,040
Ali.

126
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,680
Excuse me.

127
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,960
I think you should see this.

128
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,800
Three suns?

129
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,800
Bloody hell.

130
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,080
So much for your nightfall.

131
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,840
So much for my cocktail hour.

132
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,240
We take this as a good sign...

133
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,200
...a path, direction from Allah.

134
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,400
Blue sun, blue water.

135
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,360
Ever wondered why I'm an atheist?

136
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,880
It's a bit of a bad sign.
That's Riddick's direction.

137
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,040
I thought you found his restraints
over there. Towards sunset.

138
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,640
Right. Which means
he went towards sunrise.

139
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,400
Zeke.

140
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,680
Fully-loaded clip. Safety's on.
One shot if you spot him, okay?

141
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,760
Don't tell me you're going off, too.

142
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,000
What happens if Mr. Riddick spots us first?

143
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,640
There'll be no shots.

144
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,720
Quiet!

145
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,500
Seven stones to keep the devil at bay.

146
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,560
Sorry.

147
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,600
So, did you see anything?

148
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,360
No Riddick.

149
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,500
Trees...trees mean water.

150
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,000
You comfy up there?

151
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,375
Yes, well, its amazing how you can
do without the necessities of life,

152
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,550
-provided you have the little luxuries.
-Just keep your bloody eyes open.

153
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I don't want that dog sneaking up
on my bloody ass.

154
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:49,550
Yes, well, you dig the graves.
I'll hold the fort, old boy--

155
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,120
-Christ!
-He'd probably get you right here...

156
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,040
...right under the jaw,
and you'd never even hear him coming.

157
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,840
-Because that's how good he is.
-Tell me something,

158
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,640
Did you run away from your parents
or did they run away from you?

159
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,880
It's a communal graveyard, perhaps.

160
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,400
Like the elephants of Earth.

161
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,920
He asks what could have killed
so many great things.

162
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,880
Is this whole planet dead?

163
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,000
Drink?

164
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,280
Probably shouldn't do this.
Dehydrates you even more.

165
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,720
You're probably right.

166
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,840
You know, you could've stayed back
at the ship. Probably should've.

167
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,800
We don't find water,
you know what happens.

168
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,080
I wanted to get away.

169
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,880
I've never seen a captain
so ready to leave her ship.

170
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,400
-I think we should keep moving.
-What did Owens mean...

171
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,760
...about not touching the handle?

172
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,480
This is between you and me, Carolyn.
I promise.

173
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,880
I'm not your captain.

174
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,840
During the landing when...

175
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,640
...things were at their worst,
Owens was at his best.

176
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,080
He's the one that stopped the docking pilot
from dumping the main cabin.

177
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,200
-Passengers.
-And the docking pilot being?

178
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,520
I guess I'm a little more glad
to be here than I thought.

179
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,840
Hassan! Suleiman!

180
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,000
Captain.

181
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,360
Is there anyone here?

182
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,880
There was water here.

183
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,600
Lights?

184
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,500
Lights on? ...
Okay.

185
00:23:003,320 --> 00:23:04,840
They are saying, "God is great."

186
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,560
Yes.
This is the source of the water.

187
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,880
No darkness.

188
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,000
No lights because no darkness.

189
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,080
Hello, Mecca!

190
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,560
Tell me that was you just now.

191
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,720
What are you going on about?
He's been right here helping me.

192
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,040
Back of the ship.
That noise?

193
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,600
You trying to tell me
that was someone else?

194
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,560
No!

195
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,560
Oh, my God. I thought I was the only one
who got out of the crash alive.

196
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,440
It was just somebody else.
It was just somebody else from the crash!

197
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,440
Crikey, I thought it was him.
I thought it was Riddick.

198
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,400
No juice.

199
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,500
It looks like it's been laid up for years.

200
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,880
-But we might be able to adapt it to the--
-Shut up!

201
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,600
-Sorry, I thought I heard something.
-Like what?

202
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,440
Gunshots.

203
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
Dang!

204
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,520
Piece of shit!

205
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,320
What did you do to Zeke?

206
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,520
What did you do to him?

207
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,720
Just kill him. Just somebody
goddamn kill him before he--

208
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,520
So, where's the body?

209
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,520
Well, do you want to tell me
about the sounds?

210
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,720
Look, you told Johns you heard something.

211
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,800
That's fine.

212
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,000
You don't want to talk to me,
that's your choice. But, just so you know...

213
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,240
...there's a debate right now as to whether
we should just leave you here to die.

214
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,440
You mean the whispers?

215
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,080
What whispers?

216
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,920
The ones telling me to go for
the sweet spot just to the left of the spine.

217
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,440
Fourth lumbar down.

218
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,240
The abdominal aorta.

219
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,280
It's a metallic taste, human blood.

220
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,400
Copperish. If you cut it with
peppermint schnapps, that goes--

221
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,080
Do you want to shock me
with the truth now?

222
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,240
All you people are so scared of me.

223
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,800
Most days, I take that as a compliment.

224
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,800
But it ain't me
you got to worry about now.

225
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,120
Show me your eyes Riddick.

226
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,560
You'd have to come a lot closer for that.

227
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,360
Closer.

228
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,080
Where the hell can I get eyes like that?

229
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,200
-Gotta kill a few people.
-Okay. I can do it.

230
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,400
Then you gotta get sent to a slam where they
tell you you'll never see daylight again.

231
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,480
You dig up a doctor,
and you pay him 20 menthol Kools...

232
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,800
...to do a surgical shine job
on your eyeballs.

233
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,000
So you can see who's sneaking up 
on you in the dark?

234
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,000
-Exactly.
-Leave!

235
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,500
Leave.

236
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,880
Cute kid.

237
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,320
Did I kill a few people?

238
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,500
Sure.

239
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,040
Did I kill Zeke?

240
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,000
No.

241
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,440
You got the wrong killer.

242
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,720
He's not in the hole.
We looked.

243
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,440
Look deeper.

244
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,280
They're hollow.

245
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,520
I'm in here!

246
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,000
I'm in here! I'm inside!

247
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,920
I thought I heard something.

248
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,320
Please! Can you hear me?

249
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:01,320
I'm in here!
I'm inside!

250
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,500
Oh my God. Help me.

251
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,500
Give me your goddamn hand.

252
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,800
I heard you, Fry. I heard you first.

253
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,480
-Fry, are you okay?
-Come on.

254
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,560
-What's down there? What is it?
-Did you find Zeke?

255
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,120
-Fry, Are you okay?
-You're all right.

256
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,920
-Fuck!
-Okay.

257
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,200
That was so fucking stupid!

258
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:52,000
I don't know what the fuck is in there...

259
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,720
...but whatever it is, it got Zeke,
and it nearly got me!--

260
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,400
Get it off me! Get it off me!

261
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,760
-Get it off me! Get if off me!
-Watch it! Watch your head!

262
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,480
Finally found something
worse than me, huh?

263
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,240
So here's the deal.

264
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,000
You work without chains,
without bit, and without shivs.

265
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,360
-You do what I say, when I say it.
-For what?

266
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,200
The honor of going back
to some asshole of a cell? Fuck you.

267
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,640
The truth is...

268
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,520
...is I'm tired of chasing you.

269
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,560
Are you saying you'd cut me loose?

270
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,440
I'm thinking you could have died
in the crash.

271
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,000
My recommendation: Do me.

272
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:52,080
Don't take the chance that I'll get
shiv-happy on your wanna-be ass.

273
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,500
Hey--

274
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,640
Ghost me, motherfucker.
That's what I would do to you.

275
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,880
I want you to remember this moment.

276
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,440
The way it could have gone and didn't.

277
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,040
Here.

278
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,040
-Take it easy.
-Fuck you!

279
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,760
Do we have a deal?

280
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,800
"I want you to remember this moment."

281
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,960
-Just one?
-For now.

282
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,760
So, you click your fingers
and he's one of us now.

283
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,480
I didn't say that.

284
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,480
But at least this way, I don't have
to worry about you all, ugh...

285
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,560
...falling asleep and not waking up.

286
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,160
-So, could I talk to him now?
-No.

287
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,360
Blast!

288
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,120
Paris P. Ogilvie.
Antiquities dealer, entrepreneur.

289
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,160
Richard B. Riddick.
Escaped convict...

290
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,960
...murderer.

291
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,480
Tha-That's a particularly good Shiraz.
It-It-It's a lovely drop.

292
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,480
It-It's very expensive.

293
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,000
By all means, please.
Help yourself.

294
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,520
All right, all right.
My turn.

295
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,880
There we are, we're gettin' there.
So--

296
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,800
We've got enough power for a sys-check
but we'll still need more cells.

297
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,920
How many are we talking about?

298
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,960
Ummm...Let's see, we got a 90-gig draw.
The other...

299
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,160
...ship takes 20-gig cells, so that'd be five.

300
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,160
Five total to launch.

301
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,200
Thirty-five kilos each.

302
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,200
Well, that's pretty heavy.

303
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,680
You know that old sand cat out there?

304
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,000
I might be able to get it going.

305
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,920
Yeah, do it if you can.
But if you need a hand...

306
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,000
...Where'd Riddick go?

307
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,750
Let's go.

308
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,040
You're missing the party.
Come on, boy.

309
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,120
"Missing the party. Come on."

310
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,920
All praises be Allah,
for his many blessings to us.

311
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,500
What?

312
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,750
It's the winner of the look-alike contest.

313
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,880
-Who were these people, anyway? Miners?
-No, looks like geologists.

314
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,280
You know, an advance team,
moves around from rock to rock.

315
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,600
Nice of them to leave so much stuff here.

316
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,720
Why did they leave their ship?

317
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,840
It's not a ship. It's a skiff,
and it's disposable really.

318
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,480
It's more like an emergency life raft, right?

319
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,440
Yeah, they probably had a big
drop ship take them off planet.

320
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,480
These people didn't leave.
Come on.

321
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,520
Whoever got Zeke, got them.
They're all dead.

322
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,920
You don't really think they left
with their clothes on the hooks...

323
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,320
-...Photos on the shelves?
-Maybe they had weight limits.

324
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,000
You don't know--

325
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,320
I know you don't prep your emergency ship
unless there's a fuckin' emergency.

326
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,320
-He's fuckin' right.
-Watch your mouth.

327
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,960
Hey, he's just saying what
we're all thinking.

328
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,040
So what happened?
Where are they?

329
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,520
Has anyone seen the little one? Ali?

330
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,040
Has anyone checked the coring room?

331
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,000
-Ali?
-Jack, wait, wait.

332
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,000
Ali? ...Ali?

333
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,500
Ali?

334
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:58,900
Ali?

335
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Imam?

336
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,500
Imam?

337
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,000
Other buildings weren't secure.

338
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,080
So they ran here.
Heaviest doors.

339
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,480
Thought they'd be safe inside.
But they forgot to lock the cellar.

340
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,280
Whatever the fuck those things were,
they seem to stick to darkness.

341
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,600
So if we stick to daylight,
we should be alright, okay?

342
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:28,200
-Let's go.
-Twenty-two years ago.

343
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,720
What?

344
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,800
These coring samples are dated.

345
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,960
Last one's 22 years ago, this month.

346
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,500
OK, is there something special
about that, Carolyn?

347
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,960
I don't know.

348
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,840
There could be.

349
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,960
An eclipse.

350
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,760
You're not afraid of the dark, are you?

351
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,000
So we got to get the power cells.

352
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,040
-Shit, I've still gotta check
on the hull-- 

353
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,100
-and patch the--
-Wait on the power cells.

354
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,200
What, wait for what?
Until it's so dark, we can't even

355
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,900
-find our way back?
-You don't know when it's gonna happen,

356
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,200
-So let's not get over excited.
-Just get the fucking cells here Johns.

357
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,480
-What, What is the discussion?
-Maybe I should tell you how Riddick escaped.

358
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,680
-He can pilot?
-Yeah, he hijacked a prison transport.

359
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:41,680
Made a hell of a good run
before I tracked his ass down.

360
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,900
Okay, Okay, Maybe that's a good thing.
Maybe we can use him...

361
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,680
...to help us navigate or something.

362
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,360
He also figured out how to kill the pilot.

363
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,000
Look, you told me that we could trust him.
You said that we had a deal, Johns.
