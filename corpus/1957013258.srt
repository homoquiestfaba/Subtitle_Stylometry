3
00:00:19,273 --> 00:00:22,940
to Lou's Entertainment
Company in Lancaster.

4
00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:25,742
(static buzzing)

5
00:00:25,742 --> 00:00:28,390
- [Man] Johnson starts to
get the sun poured on him.

6
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,763
It warms up and you can
feel it on your skin.

7
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,060
- [Man] I-90 northwest
tollway in Devon Toll Plaza

8
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,173

00:00:44,622 --> 00:00:47,277

00:00:48,943 --> 00:00:50,753
for the drivers who missed it.

12
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:54,732
- [Man] What do I do in life?

13
00:00:54,732 --> 00:00:56,294
What I do is grab my paycheck

14
00:00:56,294 --> 00:00:59,211
and put it right next to the stove.

15
00:01:06,212 --> 00:01:08,063
(static buzzing)

16
00:01:08,063 --> 00:01:09,143

17
00:01:09,143 --> 00:01:10,360
and put him into a studio.

18
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,960
The guy just started wailing out after

19
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,659
about 20 years of drinking.

00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:16,492

Fall prices are up and slipping,

24
00:01:23,897 --> 00:01:28,657
but are still above $3.00 a
gallon for regular unleaded gas.

25
00:01:30,014 --> 00:01:31,670
(static buzzing)

26
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,491

of thunder showers.
- Talk?

clear up by morning though.

Nothing happened with me and Julia.

Look, Amy, we're just friends.

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,282
I was more than that, BJ.

carrying Illinois plates.

131
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,593
Stolen, last seen in Chicago this morning.

132
00:07:51,594 --> 00:07:53,975
The driver is believed to be John Lowman.

133
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:55,620
(gunshot banging)
He's wanted for six counts

134
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,603
of bank robbery and for the
murder of a federal agent.

135
00:08:01,463 --> 00:08:03,783
- [Mark] Federal agent,
hold it right there!

136
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,706
Don't do it, Lowman,
you got no where to run.

142
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,000

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,140
- [Ray] Spit it out,
Franklyn, what's going on?

144
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,380
- [Franklyn] A local girl was abducted

145
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,410
at gunpoint at the lookout point.

146
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,056
We've got a witness.

- First week out.

151
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,140
How the hell you'd do that?

152
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,253
- Well, I've been shooting guns
with my dad since I was six.

153
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,083
Lessons are gonna cost you extra.

154
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,543
- Well, how about dinner instead?

155
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,510
It's Megan, right?

156
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,343
Mark Phillips.

157
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,023
- I'll pass on dinner, thanks.

158
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,070
- What am I not your type?

159
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,783
- Well, if I had a type he
wouldn't be wearing a ring.

160
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,613
- We're legally separated.

161
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,540
She thought I'd be better
off using my law degree

162
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,470
to take down some serious corporate money

163
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,923
instead of signing on here.

164
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,163
Her dad disagreed.

165
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,260
We're gonna be here for 18 weeks.

166
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,773
Why don't you think about
that dinner invitation, okay?

167
00:10:23,943 --> 00:10:27,710
- That's um, that's good target work.

168
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,780
- Thank you, sir.

169
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:32,570
- Top 25% of your class, Saunders.

170
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,940
You shoot like you were born to it.

171
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,610
Good job so far.

172
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,360
- Thank you, sir.

173
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,590
Except, so far sounds like

174
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,090
there's a but lurking in there somewhere.

175
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,070
- Well, you know the
protocol here at the academy.

176
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,270
We not only discourage
romantic liaisons between

177
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:52,640
the trainees here, but
Agent Phillips is married.

178
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,700
- Sir, I didn't know there was

179
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,470
a law against having a conversation.

180
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,410
And Phillips says he's separated.

181
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,233
- I don't think you're hearing me.

182
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,087
If you're laboring under the delusion

183
00:11:04,087 --> 00:11:07,840
that this is a free
country, this is Quantico.

184
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,093
There's no freewill here.

185
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,913
- With all do respect, sir.

186
00:11:12,913 --> 00:11:15,010
I am not used to be reprimanded

187
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,673
for something I have not done.

188
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:19,470
- Oh, you got stones.

189
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,763
I admire that in a woman.

190
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,043
Just be careful.

191
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,410
Don't do anything that's gonna damage

192
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,510
the progress you've been making.

193
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,060
Won't look good in your report.

194
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:33,323
(dramatic music)

195
00:11:45,295 --> 00:11:49,146
- All units, the suspect
vehicle is an '04 SUV,

196
00:11:49,146 --> 00:11:50,895
burgundy with Illinois tags.

197
00:11:50,895 --> 00:11:54,645
Repeat, '04 SUV, burgundy
with Illinois tags.

198
00:11:55,855 --> 00:11:57,950
- [Officer] 61, up on your screen.

199
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,560
- Who's in charge here?

200
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,170
- Well, judging by your
badge, I'd say you are, Agent-

201
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,370
- Megan Saunders.

202
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,390
- That's a pretty fast
response from the feds

203
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,790
considering we haven't even notified you.

204
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,070
- I was in the neighborhood.

205
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,200
- Out of Chicago?

206
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,090
- I'm on vacation.

207
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,240
I picked up your chatter on my scanner.

208
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,660
- Uh huh.

209
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,130
Ray Taylor, Belgarde County Sheriff.

210
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,873
This is Deputy Franklyn.
- Hi.

211
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,560
- Looks pretty isolated out here.

212
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,010
- Yeah, the young folks drive up here

213
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,260
for the best view in town.

214
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,299
- And whatever comes with it.

215
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:27,990
- Uh, can you fill me in, Sheriff?

216
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,130
- We don't know a lot yet.

217
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,800
A young girl's been abducted.

218
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,680
Her boyfriend's SUV was stolen.

219
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,442
- [Megan] Have her parents been contacted?

220
00:12:34,442 --> 00:12:37,012
- We don't have a phone
number or an address yet.

221
00:12:37,012 --> 00:12:39,330
- Does the boy have her cell
number or know where she lived?

222
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,463
- I swear to God if you guys
didn't show up when you did,

223
00:12:41,463 --> 00:12:43,400
we'd both be dead.

224
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,830
- The girl's name is Amy Kennedy.

225
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,050
She's new at the high school.

226
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,220
Not in the mainstream yet.

227
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,340
- Yeah, BJ here thinks that she

228
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,320
lives over on Willowbrook Avenue.

229
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,870
Says he has her cell phone
number, but it's not on him.

230
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,790
- Franklyn, why don't
you take the boy home?

231
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,963
Get him to give you the cell phone number.

232
00:12:55,963 --> 00:12:57,680
- Yes, sir.
- Was there a GPS

233
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,272
device on the vehicle?
- No, that'd make it too easy.

234
00:13:00,272 --> 00:13:01,439
- Hang on, BJ.

235
00:13:02,557 --> 00:13:05,413
Did you or Amy recognize
the man who took her?

236
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,560
- No.

237
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,872
- Would you be able to
give me a description.

238
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:13,373
- Uh, it's a white dude, late 20s.

239
00:13:14,582 --> 00:13:15,593
He was huge.

240
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,043
I'd say 6'4", maybe 210.

241
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,923
- [Megan] Did he look like this?

242
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,662
- That's him.
(suspenseful music)

243
00:13:32,662 --> 00:13:36,323

(John beatboxing)
(hand tapping)

249
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,910
- That's really annoying.

250
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,930
- The singing?

251
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:00,930
- And that drumming.

252
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,673
- Anybody ever tell you
you're bossy for a kid?

253
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,883
- I'm nobody's kid.

254
00:14:14,598 --> 00:14:18,219
(thunder booming)

255
00:14:18,219 --> 00:14:19,370
- [John] What would your
parents think if they heard

256
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,920
you saying something like that?

257
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,490
- They don't care how I feel.

258
00:14:28,996 --> 00:14:30,079
- I remember.

259
00:14:31,432 --> 00:14:35,721
I remember how it was when I was your age.

260
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:37,888
Parents don't give a damn.

261
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,920
Old man beating the crap
outta me for no reason.

262
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:45,881
(thunder rumbling)

263
00:14:45,881 --> 00:14:48,890
Then one day I beat him back.

264
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,410
Harder than he ever beat me.

265
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,880
- You hit your father?

266
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:58,808
- No, I didn't have a
father, I had a drunk.

267
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:05,370
(car engine rumbling)

268
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,320
Didn't you ever wanna do that?

269
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,153
Hm?

270
00:15:09,047 --> 00:15:13,509
Didn't your mind ever
scream out to you in spades,

271
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:17,650
you know to do it back to
somebody who was doing it to you?

272
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,733
Huh, come on.

273
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:26,650
- Look, I don't know your name.

274
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:27,903
I'll forget your face.

275
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,310
I won't tell anybody what happened,

276
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,710
just drop me off somewhere, okay?

277
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:35,697
- Yeah, not until I decide.

278
00:15:35,697 --> 00:15:36,603
- Decide what?

279
00:15:37,692 --> 00:15:42,081
- Whether you're gonna
be useful to me or not.

280
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:44,914
(John beatboxing)

281
00:15:48,772 --> 00:15:50,039
(crickets chirping)

282
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,807
- Yeah, well, for the most part

283
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,290
we got a county that
people like to live in.

284
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:58,010
Very low crime rate and
we're very proud of that.

285
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,110
This kinda thing just doesn't happen here.

286
00:16:02,172 --> 00:16:04,470
You know, the car looks clean.

287
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,050
He may have just ran outta gas.

288
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,173
- Or he needed to dump a hot car.

289
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,740
You say where he kidnapped
the girl and picked up

290
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,041
the new one is about a
five minute walk from here?

291
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,131
- Yeah, about that.

292
00:16:14,131 --> 00:16:16,270
You can coordinate the
search through my office.

293
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,030
- Okay, as long as we understand

294
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,830
who's heading up this investigation.

295
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:24,380
- Look, I don't give a
damn who's in charge.

296
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,900
All I want is to get that
young girl back safely.

297
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,920
- So do I.

298
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,400
I've been following this
guy through three states.

299
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,920
- I thought you said you were on vacation.

300
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,770
- Is that a statement or a question?

301
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,480
- Maybe a little bit of both.

302
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,440
Look, can I be frank?

303
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,543
- I wish you would be.

304
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,930
- I've got nothing against you.

305
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,870
I mean, take Franklyn.

306
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,760
She's gonna be a damn good cop
once she gets the hang of it.

307
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,350
- So, youth and female go
hand-in-hand in this conversation?

308
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,830
- All I'm saying is, if you're
honchoing this operation,

309
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,520
I just hope you know what you're doing.

310
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,550
- We can get into my credentials later.

311
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,160
We're wasting time.

312
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,570
- Look, I feel it's never a waste of time

313
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,040
to know who you're working with.

314
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,250
- I was at the top of
my class at Quantico.

315
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,500
I've been on the field
for almost three years,

316
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,420
mainly on bank robbery detail.

317
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,920
- Which is why you're chasing Lowman?

318
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,850
- He robs banks.

319
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,980
I go after people who rob banks.

320
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,969
- [Franklyn] Sheriff Taylor?

321
00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:19,070
- Taylor.

322
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,180
- [Franklyn] A letter
is out to our department

323
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,160
and the state police.

324
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,552
- Copy that, what's your 20?

325
00:17:22,552 --> 00:17:23,670
- [Franklyn] Carol Kennedy.

326
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,990
- Follow me.

327
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,240
(light dramatic music)

328
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,230
Nice neighborhood if you got

329
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,830
an extra million or two to burn.

330
00:17:41,312 --> 00:17:43,280
- [Franklyn] The mother,
Carol Kennedy, she's inside.

331
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,310
Father, Dennis Kennedy,

332
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,330
he's flying back from a business trip.

333
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,630
He's a commodities trader
and she's in real estate.

334
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,630
They're both pretty shook up.

335
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,123
- Do you have any idea
who would want to do this?

336
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,160
- His name is John
Lowman, he's a fugative,

337
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,500
and he's wanted on a few charges.

338
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,740
- But why, why would
anyone wanna take Amy?

339
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,990
- I think Amy and her friend were

340
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,720
just at the wrong place at the wrong time.

341
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,200
- What friend?

342
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,580
- A BJ Busconi, a young
boy from the high school.

343
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,003
You didn't know Amy was with him?

344
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:15,070
(Carol sighs)
- No.

345
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,950
She was supposed to be at a
school play with a girlfriend.

346
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,250
I asked her to call to let us know

347
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,700
when she was on her way home.

348
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,360
Her life is in danger.

349
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,600
- We know that, ma'am.

350
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,223
The man that took her-
- No, you don't understand.

351
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,180
Amy has type one diabetes.

352
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,040
He blood sugar swings very greatly.

353
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,140
If Amy doesn't eat regularly,
get her insulin on schedule,

354
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,010
she could go into a coma and die.

355
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,000
- When was the last time she
ate and had her injection?

356
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,040
- Well, she had a shot after school

357
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,500
because I found her needle, but-

358
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,250
- What?
(Carol sighs)

359
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:55,113
- I don't know if she had supper.

360
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:59,570
Without eating, taking her
insulin would put her in danger.

361
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:02,450
- Realistically, how long do we have?

362
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,660
- It could happen very fast.

363
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,623
- How fast?

364
00:19:06,621 --> 00:19:10,977
- A matter of hours.
(dramatic music)

365
00:19:10,977 --> 00:19:14,640
(car engine rumbling)

366
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,797
- [Newsman] It's 10:30 in
the Windy City, people.

367
00:19:15,797 --> 00:19:19,040
Reports of a stolen late model dark SUV

368
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,300
in the Belgarde County region.

369
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,269
If you see it-
- Don't look back.

370
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:22,697
- Please don't approach it.
- At the car behind.

371
00:19:22,697 --> 00:19:23,530
- [Newsman] Call the local authorities

372
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,596
with the location and the direction

373
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:25,429
the vehicle was traveling.
- What's your name?

374
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:26,823
- [Newsman] Try and get
that girl home safe.

375
00:19:26,823 --> 00:19:27,656
- Amy.
- Amy.

376
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:31,883
We're gonna have one fast rule here, Amy.

377
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:34,607
You see the gun in my belt?

378
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:38,633
If anything bad happens,
it's gonna be all up on you.

379
00:19:42,868 --> 00:19:44,430
(water splashing)

380
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,548
- We moved here when my husband
was transferred in his job.

381
00:19:47,548 --> 00:19:49,440
(light dramatic music)

382
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,260
Amy still misses her old friends.

383
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,090
She hasn't adjusted
well to the new school.

384
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,130
- How does Amy handle her condition?

385
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,020
- She doesn't like to be
babied, that's for sure.

386
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,610
But she's self conscious,

387
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,590
feels it prevents her from
fitting in with the other kids.

388
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,273
She's become very good
at hiding her secret.

389
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,850
- Does she use the insulin pen

390
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,320
or does she just have injections?

391
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,300
- Injections.

392
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,100
We constantly have to factor and adjust,

393
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,680
check her blood sugars, give her shots,

394
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,030
just for her to stay alive.

395
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,950
We bought her a glucometer
so that she would always know

396
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,323
what her blood sugar is.

397
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,670
You know how scattered teenagers can be.

398
00:20:27,287 --> 00:20:29,000
(Carol sighs)

399
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,453
That's Amy with her horse.

400
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,430
- She rides?
- Did.

401
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,513
We sold the horse when we moved here.

402
00:20:36,513 --> 00:20:38,500
I mean, what else could we do?

403
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,260
It broke her heart.

404
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,960
- This one's better for the media.

405
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,040
- Sure.

406
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,710
- You say her cell phone is new which

407
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,470
is the voicemail hasn't been setup?

408
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,210
- Once we were notified
we kept trying to call,

409
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,470
but there's never an answer.

410
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,710
- We'll keep trying.

411
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,710
If the phone is used we
can triangulate the signal

412
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,763
between cell towers and get her location.

413
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,360
- Well, shouldn't we be
prepared for a ransom call?

414
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,870
I mean, doesn't the FBI come
in and setup a phone tap or?

415
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,880
- I don't think that's the situation here.

416
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,830
- What do you mean?

417
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,390
What is the situation here?

418
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,340
With Amy's condition she could die!

419
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,880
- A deputy will be with you at all times.

420
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,350
We'll notify the law enforcement

421
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,423
of her condition as soon as possible.

422
00:21:18,442 --> 00:21:19,810
(Carol sighs)
- Thank you.

423
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,250
- We need your help, Mrs. Kennedy.

424
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,640
We need a supply glucose and
insulin as soon as possible.

425
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,370
- Yes, of course, I'm sorry.

426
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,293
Anything I can do.

427
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,834
- How many deputies do we have?

428
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:32,380
- Five.
- That's not enough.

429
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,100
- This isn't Chicago, Agent Saunders.

430
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,760
We have limited resources.

431
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,110
- A woman's life is at stake.

432
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,575
Make it happen.

433
00:21:38,575 --> 00:21:41,825
(light dramatic music)

434
00:21:45,994 --> 00:21:48,474
- Whoever it is, he's not going away.

435
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,383
Just relax.

436
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,040
- What if I don't wanna relax?

437
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,244
Suppose I don't wanna do
what you're telling me.

438
00:21:56,244 --> 00:21:58,320
- If that even comes close to happening,

439
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,004
I'm not gonna be very
happy with you, am I?

440
00:22:01,004 --> 00:22:03,644
(car engine roaring)

441
00:22:03,644 --> 00:22:05,055
Uh huh.

442
00:22:05,055 --> 00:22:08,234
There we go.
(hand tapping)

443
00:22:08,234 --> 00:22:10,463
Nothing to worry about.

444
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:12,447
(eerie music)

445
00:22:12,447 --> 00:22:14,747
Except your boyfriend
left us riding on empty.

446
00:22:16,004 --> 00:22:17,754
Need to stop by a gas station soon.

447
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,422
- He's not my boyfriend.

448
00:22:21,422 --> 00:22:23,470
(John scoffs)
- Not your boyfriend.

449
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,394
What you go up to a place like that

450
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:26,944
with just anybody who asks you?

451
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,520
- We were just talking.

452
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:37,023
He was gonna take me for a
burger after school, but hey,

453
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,093
I don't have to explain anything to you.

454
00:22:41,815 --> 00:22:44,565
(John chuckling)

455
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:49,760
(crickets chirping)

456
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,280
- The reason could be to kidnap the girl.

457
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,120
I mean, not necessarily
Amy Kennedy, but someone.

458
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,130
- That's not his MO.

459
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,590
He usually robs banks.
- And he kills cops, too.

460
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,266
So it's not a big stretch to imagine

461
00:23:00,266 --> 00:23:03,150
he'd snatch someone for cash.

462
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,950
- In any case, he could
be hiding out nearby.

463
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,850
Maybe in the woods near Cotter Creek

464
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,040
or by the old refinery.

465
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,805
- You know more about our
county than you've led on.

466
00:23:12,805 --> 00:23:14,070
(officers talking over each other)

467
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,710
Listen up, people.

468
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,823
I need your attention.

469
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,360
For now, this'll be our
task force command center

470
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,110
for the investigation into
the kidnapping of Amy Kennedy.

471
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:28,050
This is Special Agent
Megan Saunders of the FBI.

472
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:31,400
- As of now, you are all
under federal jurisdiction.

473
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Our suspect, John Carl Lowman,
is on the run for robbing

474
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,840
a bank and the killing of an FBI agent.

475
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,840
He's been IDed as the suspect
who has kidnapped Amy Kennedy.

476
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,200
- Now we believe that they
are still in our area.

477
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,300
But right now we're more than

478
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,480
three hours into this investigation.

479
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,990
- We're at a critical point right now

480
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,200
for more than one reason.

481
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,040
The chances of finding
a kidnap victim diminish

482
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,210
drastically after the first 24 hours.

483
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:02,150
In addition to that, Amy has diabetes.

484
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,040
She's in an unstable condition,

485
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,560
she needs regular insulin
shots and the clock is ticking.

486
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,530
- So, people, we need to move hard

487
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:12,910
and we need to move fast on this.

488
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,330
- I need a direct line
to the state police.

489
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,675
You don't have to look to
Sheriff Taylor, I'm in charge.

490
00:24:17,675 --> 00:24:18,867
- Just do it, Franklyn.

491
00:24:18,867 --> 00:24:21,530
- And you, I need you to
contact all neighboring

492
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,690
counties and see what
resources they can spare.

493
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,290
We need more bodies and we need them now.

494
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:29,013
- [Man] Around midnight, the
Midnight Blues with Papa G.

495
00:24:29,013 --> 00:24:30,850
Just an hour away, it's your your guide

496
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,680
to the best new blues
coming out of Illinois.

497
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,530
All your favorite classics will be by

498
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,329
to help you wind things down.

499
00:24:36,329 --> 00:24:37,708
- [John] Get out.

500
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,370
(crickets chirping)

501
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,970
- [Amy] Are you leaving me here?

502
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:46,999
- Just get out.
(car beeping)

503
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:50,249
(light dramatic music)

504
00:24:58,668 --> 00:25:01,418
(screw rattling)

505
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,290
Why are you wearing makeup?

506
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,143
- What's wrong with makeup?

507
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:13,802
- Trying to look older?

508
00:25:13,802 --> 00:25:16,359
- I'm not trying to do anything.

509
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:19,559
(John scoffs)

510
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,483
- I think you are.

511
00:25:23,308 --> 00:25:24,980
I just think you're
trying to fit in, right?

512
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,813
- Wrong.

513
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,623
- You don't fit in anyway though, do ya?

514
00:25:37,489 --> 00:25:40,239
Trying to run would be a mistake.

515
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,122
- I wasn't going to.

516
00:25:42,122 --> 00:25:44,483
- [John] I know you
were thinking about it.

517
00:25:45,715 --> 00:25:48,503
(license plate rattling)

518
00:25:48,503 --> 00:25:51,253
(horse neighing)

519
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,736
- He's lonely.
(horse snorting)

520
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,395
(John scoffs)

521
00:25:58,395 --> 00:25:59,812
- Who, the horse?

522
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,046
We're freezing our butts out here,

523
00:26:03,046 --> 00:26:06,743
he's in the nice warm
stall, plenty of hay.

524
00:26:07,995 --> 00:26:09,245
Not a worry in the world.

525
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,960
- Depends on who's taking care of him.

526
00:26:13,983 --> 00:26:15,150
Who loves him.

527
00:26:16,664 --> 00:26:18,864
- What do you know about horses?

528
00:26:18,864 --> 00:26:19,697
- I had one.

529
00:26:21,294 --> 00:26:23,163
His name was Buddy.

530
00:26:25,886 --> 00:26:26,860
(John sighs)

531
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,963
- Where we're going there's horses.

532
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,163
- Where?

533
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:41,603
- You behave and you'll
get to see 'em, okay?

534
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,523
- Can I get back inside?
(John sniffing)

535
00:26:55,535 --> 00:26:57,135
- Just don't try anything, okay?

536
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,290
(car beeping)

537
00:27:08,478 --> 00:27:10,240
(car door slamming)

538
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,480
- So the area that I was mentioning,

539
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,090
it's all crisscrossed by farm roads.

540
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:18,090
Then there's woodlands
around the outer reaches,

541
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:21,670
so I'm thinking that if
Lowman goes in there,

542
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:24,270
well, he'll be like your
basic needle in a haystack.

543
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,230
Still think he's coming
to Belgarde intentionally?

544
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,113
- Just haven't figured out why.

545
00:27:31,836 --> 00:27:34,733
- You never said when it was
you were through here before.

546
00:27:35,594 --> 00:27:37,700
- Well, that was a long time ago.

547
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,533
- Business?

548
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,940
- I have some relatives nearby.

549
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,577
- I've lived here most of my life.

550
00:27:44,577 --> 00:27:46,143
Be anyone I might know?

551
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,690
- I don't think so.

552
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:52,220
- [Franklyn] Sheriff Taylor.

553
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,620
You have a call on line two.

554
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,333
- [Ray] Thanks.

555
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:59,290
- Uh, the cell phone
company called and says

556
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,950
that she hasn't made a
call since yesterday,

557
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:03,160
but we have them monitoring the phones.

558
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,253
- Okay, just keep on it.

559
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,320
- Can I ask you something, Agent Saunders?

560
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,515
- As long as you call me Megan.

561
00:28:13,515 --> 00:28:18,515
- Okay, Megan, well, okay I
know why I signed up to do this

562
00:28:21,007 --> 00:28:23,250
and I do not doubt that,

563
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:27,250
but you know there's a certain
amount of day-to-day stuff

564
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:31,330
to deal with and well, I
guess I was just wondering

565
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:32,513
do you have any advice?

566
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,173
- On figuring out the alpha male?

567
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:40,090
- Yeah, that about spells it out.

568
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,883
- Just don't get discouraged.

569
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:47,620
- The FBI must be a
whole different ballpark.

570
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,290
- No, not that much.

571
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,834
They still wanna prove that
they're bigger and stronger.

572
00:28:51,834 --> 00:28:52,667
- Oh.

573
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:55,430
- There's no law against being
smarter than them, is there?

574
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,730
- No, none that I've read.

575
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:58,963
- Why did you join up?

576
00:29:01,475 --> 00:29:04,063
(Franklyn sighs)
- Well, it was my sister.

577
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:09,293
She uh, she was coming
home late one night,

578
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,550
she got car jacked and she was murdered.

579
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,053
- I'm so sorry.

580
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,353
- Thanks.

581
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,910
While you're here if there's
anything that you need, just...

582
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:26,893
- Thanks.

583
00:29:28,495 --> 00:29:31,162
(phone beeping)

584
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,733
Dad, Megan.

585
00:29:35,724 --> 00:29:38,370
I'm in Belgarde County on a kidnapping.

586
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,713
So far I'm coming up empty.

587
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,163
Listen, I don't have your address,

588
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,670
but I'd like to pick your brain.

589
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,326
(suspenseful music)

590
00:29:53,326 --> 00:29:54,486
(Amy gasps)

591
00:29:54,486 --> 00:29:59,016
- Don't you try anything.
(Amy panting)

592
00:29:59,016 --> 00:29:59,933
- [Amy] Ow.

593
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,190
(light dramatic music)

594
00:30:18,221 --> 00:30:21,138
- No, I don't think anybody saw us.

595
00:30:23,452 --> 00:30:25,152
We need to get gas somewhere else.

596
00:30:26,251 --> 00:30:28,751
(Amy panting)

597
00:30:30,721 --> 00:30:31,554
What's the matter with you?

598
00:30:31,554 --> 00:30:32,387
You okay?

599
00:30:34,281 --> 00:30:36,260
- I'm not feeling well.

600
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,590
I need something to eat.

601
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:43,313
- Oh, we'll pick something
up when we get gas, okay?

602
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:47,843
Amy?

603
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,600
Look, I think I'm being
fairly accommodating here.

604
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,150
Okay, when I ask you a
question I expect an answer.

605
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:56,172
Huh?
(Amy gasps)

606
00:30:56,172 --> 00:30:57,220
- Okay, yes.

607
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,053
- Yes, what?

608
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,200
- I'd like some food.
- You'd like some food what?

609
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,961
- Please.
- Aha, please, good, good.

610
00:31:07,961 --> 00:31:10,961
(suspenseful music)

611
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,410
- So, he starts his criminal
career at the age of 14

612
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,960
by trying to murder his
father with a butcher knife.

613
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,590
I'd say that qualifies him
as having a screw loose.

614
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:22,480
- Institutionalized till he was 19.

615
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,930
Psych report said he can go off

616
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:26,740
at anytime and the judge lets him walk.

617
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,700
- Well, there's hanging judges

618
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,400
and there's revolving door judges.

619
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,160
Spare me from the latter.

620
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,710
Thanks, Tony.

621
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:37,460
So, a series of auto thefts
and petty crimes follow,

622
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,240
a hard time in Arizona and then again

623
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,420
at my favorite getaway, Joliet.

624
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,760
And then he graduates to the big time.

625
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,490
- A series of bank heists.

626
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,753
- And a suspected killer
of a federal agent.

627
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,770
- There's nothing suspect about it.

628
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,920
Lowman pulled the trigger.

629
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,180
- You say that with the conviction
of someone who was there.

630
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,653
- The agent who was shot was my partner.

631
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,530
- Well, that explains some things.

632
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,120
I may just be a country Sheriff
elected every four years

633
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,053
by a bunch of farmers and
loggers, but I know people,

634
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,950
and I knew something was nagging at you.

635
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,133
- It's a nightmare I keep reliving.

636
00:32:17,262 --> 00:32:20,690
- Now, the thing is
when we catch this SOB,

637
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,380
with or without the girl he's looking at

638
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,420
a date with death row.

639
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,683
He's got nothing to lose.

640
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,320
- That's what I'm worried about.

641
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,251
- This is?
- My partner who was shot.

642
00:32:35,251 --> 00:32:38,100
(phone ringing)

643
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,333
- Sheriff Taylor.
(static buzzing)

644
00:32:43,747 --> 00:32:45,982
(lips smacking)

645
00:32:45,982 --> 00:32:47,700
- The way you've been handling
the pressure out there

646
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,263
is nothing short of amazing.

647
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,530
- Pressure's only felt by people

648
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,131
who don't know what they're doing.

649
00:32:54,131 --> 00:32:55,942
- Is that straight out of the manual?

650
00:32:55,942 --> 00:32:57,290
- [Megan] Uh uh.

651
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,910
- An inspiring school teacher?

652
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,490
- My dad.

653
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,590
He also didn't want me to join the Bureau.

654
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,070
- That made you more
determined than ever, huh?

655
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,943
- It's genetic.

656
00:33:08,761 --> 00:33:10,830
I don't think we should be doing this.

657
00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:14,281
- What, getting to know each other?

658
00:33:14,281 --> 00:33:15,643
Dating?

659
00:33:15,643 --> 00:33:19,573
- Well, I don't know, we're
not even out on the field yet.

660
00:33:22,321 --> 00:33:24,979
- Are you really gonna let
Jack Bryant stand between us?

661
00:33:24,979 --> 00:33:27,030
I mean, we both want
the same things, right?

662
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:27,993
We'll be discrete.

663
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,499
- What does Jack Bryant have against us?

664
00:33:31,499 --> 00:33:33,253
We're just getting to know each other.

665
00:33:34,169 --> 00:33:35,406
(Mark sighs)

666
00:33:35,406 --> 00:33:36,743
- He's my father-in-law.

667
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,860
- You were married to his daughter?

668
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,533
- Bryant's been bribing
me to go back to her.

669
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:52,923
But look, I have moved on with my life.

670
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,570
And I want you there with me.

671
00:33:59,384 --> 00:34:01,515
(lips smacking)

672
00:34:01,515 --> 00:34:04,630
- [Ray] And he meant something to you?

673
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:07,280
Agent?
(phone ringing)

674
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,523
- We met at Quantico and then

675
00:34:08,523 --> 00:34:10,523
we were put on the bank detail together.

676
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,990
- So, he was more than just a partner.

677
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:15,710
- We were together for three years.

678
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:19,200
- Which makes it personal for
you and that's not healthy.

679
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,203
- I can handle it.

680
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,270
- What's your intent?

681
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,890
- To find Amy Kennedy
and if Lowman's with her,

682
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,690
I'll deal with him after she's safe.

683
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,063
- Fair enough.

684
00:34:32,056 --> 00:34:34,883
The girl's mother is here,
dropping off her insulin.

685
00:34:34,883 --> 00:34:39,133
(officers talking over each other)

686
00:34:43,718 --> 00:34:45,150
- Oh.

687
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,413
This is all we had on hand.

688
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,460
The blue is long lasting,
the yellow is short.

689
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,293
She's gonna need both.

690
00:34:51,293 --> 00:34:52,643
- How long will this last?

691
00:34:52,643 --> 00:34:54,270
- A couple of weeks, maybe a month.

692
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,100
Oh, and I also brought this.

693
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,540
- What is that?
- It's glucose.

694
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,840
Basically sugar water,
she's gonna need this.

695
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,780
Maybe more so than the insulin.

696
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,265
If you, I mean, when you find-

697
00:35:06,265 --> 00:35:09,476
(bottle clinking)
(Carol crying)

698
00:35:09,476 --> 00:35:10,309
- Hey.
- I am so sorry.

699
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:11,963
- Look, come sit down, sit down.

700
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:17,510
- I'm so sorry, it's just my nerves.

701
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,140
- I know, I don't know
how you're holding up

702
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,886
as well as you are.

703
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:23,880
(Carol gasps)

704
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,090
- Amy's all we have.

705
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,393
She's my baby.

706
00:35:30,707 --> 00:35:32,100
Thank you.

707
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:36,180
Sometimes Amy thinks she's a burden to us,

708
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:40,093
but oh, she means everything to me.

709
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,670
- Can I get you anything else?

710
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,563
- No, no, thank you.

711
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,930
I should go to the airport
and wait for my husband.

712
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:55,420
- Before you go, this isn't
going to be enough insulin

713
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,766
to hand out to all our units.

714
00:35:56,766 --> 00:35:58,000
- All right, I'll call Amy's doctor.

715
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,990
- And we'll call the hospital.

716
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,460
Are there any more instructions
I can give to my people?

717
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,960
- Oh, it's just so complicated.

718
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,980
It's not like taking a
spoonful of cough medicine.

719
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,227
Her blood sugar has to be checked first.

720
00:36:07,227 --> 00:36:09,143
Her glucometer should help.

721
00:36:09,143 --> 00:36:10,684
- [Megan] All right, okay.

722
00:36:10,684 --> 00:36:12,015
- [Man] This is 101.1.

723
00:36:12,015 --> 00:36:12,884
Coming up after the break,

724
00:36:12,884 --> 00:36:14,462
your up to the minute news to midnight.

725
00:36:14,462 --> 00:36:17,962
Traffic, weather, together all after this.

726
00:36:19,572 --> 00:36:21,119
(car door slamming)

727
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,772
(seatbelt whirring)

728
00:36:22,772 --> 00:36:26,022
(light dramatic music)

729
00:36:27,172 --> 00:36:29,652
(car door squeaking)

730
00:36:29,652 --> 00:36:31,069
- [John] Come on.

731
00:36:33,332 --> 00:36:35,822
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

732
00:36:35,822 --> 00:36:37,512
Looks like you had one too many, girl.

733
00:36:37,512 --> 00:36:39,584
- I was just dizzy for a second.

734
00:36:39,584 --> 00:36:40,992
I'm okay.

735
00:36:40,992 --> 00:36:42,325
I'm just hungry.

736
00:36:43,403 --> 00:36:44,997
- Okay.

737
00:36:44,997 --> 00:36:47,383
And remember I've got
a gun under my shirt.

738
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,760
I don't want anyone damaged unnecessarily.

739
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,682
Do you?
- No, I don't.

740
00:36:53,682 --> 00:36:55,190
- Okay.

741
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,350
You speak out of turn, you try to run,

742
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,177
you're the one that's gonna
get hurt and I don't want that

743
00:36:59,177 --> 00:37:01,654
'cause I like you, okay?

744
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:03,894
(Amy panting)

745
00:37:03,894 --> 00:37:05,144
- Okay.
- Okay, come on.

746
00:37:12,883 --> 00:37:14,504
(door creaking)

747
00:37:14,504 --> 00:37:15,890
- [Man] US-41 Lakeshore driving south.

748
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,673
- What will it be there, folks?

749
00:37:19,128 --> 00:37:21,715
- Uh, vehicle at pump two.

750
00:37:21,715 --> 00:37:23,150
I'm gonna need to fill it.

751
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,050
- Sure thing.

752
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,337
Anything else for you tonight?

753
00:37:26,337 --> 00:37:27,670
- Hm, maybe some snacks?

754
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,234
Hm, huh?
- 580, 594.

755
00:37:29,234 --> 00:37:31,090
Hickory Parkway westbound is slow going

756
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:31,953
with the ramp to 394 closed.
- Right there.

757
00:37:33,714 --> 00:37:35,580
- You the boss, Jason?

758
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,860
- Night assistant manager.

759
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,333
11:00 to 7:00, I'm your man.

760
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,693
- Ah.

761
00:37:41,788 --> 00:37:43,748
- The I-90, I-95-
- Why don't you, uh,

762
00:37:43,748 --> 00:37:45,850
- Expressway inbound-
- Go see over there,

763
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:47,759
see if there's anything you'd like, okay?

764
00:37:47,759 --> 00:37:49,128
- [Man] Are closed until further notice.

765
00:37:49,128 --> 00:37:51,839
And only three local lanes are
available in each direction.

766
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,422
- Night assistant manager, huh?

767
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,050
That's a hell of a lot
of responsible, Jason.

768
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,460
- Sometimes it can be.
- Michigan Avenue.

769
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,020
- Huh.
- Or the combination of

770
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,802
the Skyway, Stony Island
and Lakeshore Drive.

771
00:38:03,802 --> 00:38:06,122
The I-90 Chicago Skyway outbound

772
00:38:06,122 --> 00:38:08,421
has scheduled construction
between St. Lawrence Ave.

773
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:11,171
(sirens wailing)

774
00:38:14,752 --> 00:38:15,723
(dramatic music)
And light south winds

775
00:38:15,723 --> 00:38:18,803
of 15 miles per hour, with a high of 64.

776
00:38:18,803 --> 00:38:20,272
(beads rattling)
Overcast and chance of showers

777
00:38:20,272 --> 00:38:22,723
throughout the day and into the night.

778
00:38:22,723 --> 00:38:25,843
Breaking news now concerning
a stolen black SUV

779
00:38:25,843 --> 00:38:27,030
in the Belgarde County region-

780
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,961
- Oh, I thought you were hungry?

781
00:38:27,961 --> 00:38:28,868
- [Man] With reports that a young girl-

782
00:38:28,868 --> 00:38:30,850
- They don't have much here.
- May be kidnapped.

783
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,464
- I think I just need some sugar.

784
00:38:32,464 --> 00:38:33,842
- [Man] The vehicle was
reported stolen four hours ago-

785
00:38:33,842 --> 00:38:35,192
- You hear that Jason, huh?

786
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,870
Empty shelves, that reflects directly

787
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:41,150
on your managerial skills.

788
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,650
- We run outta stuff pretty fast.

789
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,413
We're the last stop for 16 miles.

790
00:38:45,493 --> 00:38:47,732
We have a delivery tomorrow though.

791
00:38:47,732 --> 00:38:51,170
- Well, that doesn't help
us right now, does it?

792
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:54,200
Go outside, fill up the tank, okay?

793
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,202
Remember what I told you
about people getting hurt.

794
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:58,035
Yeah?

795
00:38:59,402 --> 00:39:02,184
Now, go.
(eerie music)

796
00:39:02,184 --> 00:39:03,017
Go.

797
00:39:05,442 --> 00:39:07,110
- I can't unlock the
pump unless you've paid,

798
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,973
so will that be-
(Amy gasping)

799
00:39:11,093 --> 00:39:12,530
- You know what, I don't
seem to have my wallet

800
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:15,651
with me tonight, Jason,
so I'd appreciate it if-

801
00:39:15,651 --> 00:39:17,460
(Amy groaning)

802
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,910
- No.
- No?

803
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:21,430
- Sorry, I can't unlock the
pump unless you've paid.

804
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,128
It's policy, it's story policy.

805
00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:25,461
(suspenseful music)

806
00:39:25,461 --> 00:39:28,701
(Amy sniffling)

807
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:30,760
- Unlock the pump, Jason.

808
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,760
We need gas.

809
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,833
- I can't.

810
00:39:36,029 --> 00:39:39,530
- Unlock the pump.
(suspenseful music)

811
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:40,863
Unlock the pump.

812
00:39:42,258 --> 00:39:44,925
(neck cracking)

813
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,320
- We have enough glucose,
but we need more insulin.

814
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,310
Mrs. Kennedy's doctor will
meet you at the hospital.

815
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,173
- [Franklyn] Okay, I'll
pull my car around.

816
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:59,220
- Can we find her in time?

817
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,290
- We're doing our best.

818
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:03,010
- This is your area of
expertise, isn't it?

819
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:03,843
Kidnapping?

820
00:40:03,843 --> 00:40:06,750
I mean, that is why Sheriff
Taylor brought you in.

821
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,888
- I had been working on
the bank robbery detail.

822
00:40:09,888 --> 00:40:10,950
(Carol scoffs)

823
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:14,050
- You've never worked on
a kidnapping case before?

824
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:15,430
- This is my first.

825
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,650
I was in the area tracking
the movements of the man

826
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,950
who took Amy and then I
joined up with Sheriff Taylor.

827
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,370
- Oh, can't they send us someone-

828
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,970
- Who knows what they're doing?

829
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,860
- I didn't mean that.

830
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,000
- I know what I'm doing.

831
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,530
I've contacted the FBI
Field Office in Chicago.

832
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,110
There will be more agents coming.

833
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:32,048
I was trained for this.

834
00:40:32,048 --> 00:40:34,798
(dramatic music)

835
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,773
- It's unlocked.

836
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:40,989
- Good boy.

837
00:40:40,989 --> 00:40:42,240
Good.
(car door slamming)

838
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,740
(Amy panting)

839
00:40:56,918 --> 00:41:00,307
(phone beeping)

840
00:41:00,307 --> 00:41:03,520
(phone ringing)

841
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,977
- All I want is Amy back in
my arms again, that's all.

842
00:41:05,977 --> 00:41:09,460
(phone ringing)

843
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:12,021
Amy, Amy is that you honey?

844
00:41:12,021 --> 00:41:13,810
- Mom, Mommy?

845
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:16,773
Oh, God, something terrible has happened.

846
00:41:18,284 --> 00:41:21,284
(suspenseful music)

847
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,564
(gunshot banging)

848
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:24,673
(Amy gasps)

849
00:41:24,673 --> 00:41:26,280
- Oh, my God, I heard gunshots.

850
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,700
- Oh, God.
- Amy?

851
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,360
This is Meg Saunders, I'm with the FBI.

852
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,670
I'm gonna try to find you.

853
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,981
Are you alone?
- Yeah.

854
00:41:33,981 --> 00:41:35,550
Yeah, for now.

855
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,963
- Do you know where you are?

856
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:39,160
- I need to talk with my mother.

857
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,260
- Talk to me.
- Okay.

858
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,553
- Is the man who took you nearby?

859
00:41:44,553 --> 00:41:47,310
- He's inside a gas station.

860
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,430
And there were gunshots.

861
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:50,513
- Do you know where you are?

862
00:41:51,649 --> 00:41:53,164
- I don't know.

863
00:41:53,164 --> 00:41:55,600
We've been driving around and around.

864
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,542
- [Megan] Are you still
in Belgarde County?

865
00:41:57,542 --> 00:41:59,943
- I don't know, I don't know.
(Amy crying)

866
00:41:59,943 --> 00:42:01,650
- Ask the last time she had her shot.

867
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:04,730
- [Megan] When was the last
time you had your insulin?

868
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,090
- After school.

869
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,820
- Have you eaten dinner?

870
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:11,290
- He was gonna take me for a
burger, but we never made it.

871
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,280
- Have you eaten anything?

872
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,050
- I just, I just had a donut and a drink.

873
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,060
- Do you know the name of the gas station?

874
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,809
Do you see any sign?

875
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:21,860
(suspenseful music)
- It says-

876
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,687
- That's very, very stupid.

877
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:28,980
- [Megan] Amy, are you there?

878
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,380
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's here.

879
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,668
(Amy crying)
Who's this?

880
00:42:31,668 --> 00:42:34,188
- This is Special Agent Megan Saunders.

881
00:42:34,188 --> 00:42:36,948
Is this John Lowman?
(Amy crying)

882
00:42:36,948 --> 00:42:38,610
- I'm not gonna answer that.

883
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:41,880
But I am impressed that the
FBI is handling carjacking now.

884
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,100
- This is not a carjacking,
this is a kidnapping.

885
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,420
You took her against her will.

886
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,609
We need you to let her
go before it's too late.

887
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:51,278
(dramatic music)
(Amy crying)

888
00:42:51,278 --> 00:42:54,846
- How do you know I have
her here against her will?

889
00:42:54,846 --> 00:42:56,438
Yeah, maybe we're having a good time.

890
00:42:56,438 --> 00:42:58,430
Ain't we, Amy?

891
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:00,440
Maybe she likes the adventure.

892
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,858
- Has she told you about her condition-

893
00:43:01,858 --> 00:43:03,263
(phone clicking)

894
00:43:03,263 --> 00:43:04,440
- Ow.
- You told me that

895
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,273
you didn't have a phone.

896
00:43:05,273 --> 00:43:06,650
You said you didn't have a phone.

897
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,110
- I forgot I had it with me.

898
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:11,064
- Oh, yeah, yeah?
(Amy crying)

899
00:43:11,064 --> 00:43:11,897
(phone thudding)
Well, you don't have

900
00:43:11,897 --> 00:43:13,156
one anymore.
- What happened?

901
00:43:13,156 --> 00:43:14,470
(phone beeping)

902
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:15,500
- She's with Lowman.

903
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,913
He hung up.
- Oh, God.

904
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:19,625
- What kinda watch is this?
- No.

905
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:21,513
It's not a watch.
(glucometer beeping)

906
00:43:21,513 --> 00:43:23,894
Please don't hurt me, please.

907
00:43:23,894 --> 00:43:26,310
- Okay, just relax, come on.
- Please, no.

908
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:28,033
- [John] Get in there.

909
00:43:28,033 --> 00:43:31,033
(car door slamming)

910
00:43:33,782 --> 00:43:36,873
(car engine rumbling)

911
00:43:36,873 --> 00:43:39,790
(tires screeching)

912
00:43:43,004 --> 00:43:45,110
- Whittaker's with the cell carrier now.

913
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:47,200
Trying to see if we can
pinpoint their signal.

914
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,510
- When I talked to her she
sounded scared to death.

915
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:51,713
It's been 10 hours since her last shot.

916
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:55,170
- Yeah, well, even if that
gas station is in the county,

917
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:56,647
I can guarantee you won't-
- Lowman's not gonna be there

918
00:43:56,647 --> 00:43:58,830
when we get there, but I'm gonna do

919
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:00,187
what I should have done a long time ago.

920
00:44:00,187 --> 00:44:01,847
I'm gonna go there and-

921
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:05,657
- You Sheriff Taylor?
- That would be me.

922
00:44:05,657 --> 00:44:06,690
And you are?

923
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:09,220
- Jack Bryant, Special
Agent Chicago Field Office.

924
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:12,443
Can we talk?
(dramatic music)

925
00:44:12,443 --> 00:44:15,025
(glucometer beeping)

926
00:44:15,025 --> 00:44:18,290
- What do you mean it's not a real watch?

927
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:19,820
- It monitors my glucose levels

928
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,520
without me having to prick myself.

929
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:23,763
I have diabetes.

930
00:44:27,274 --> 00:44:29,460
- You gotta take medicine for that?

931
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,973
- Injections after I eat.

932
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,220
What happened back at the gas station?

933
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,968
- Yeah, with Jason?

934
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,130
The boy took too much
corporate responsibility

935
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:45,500
on his shoulders.

936
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,350
It's not like we were robbing a bank.

937
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,464
- Why would you do that?

938
00:44:54,464 --> 00:44:57,047
He wasn't even a threat to you.

939
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,430
- Honestly, sometimes I don't
know why I do what I do.

940
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:08,020
What happens if you don't
take your injections?

941
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,207
- I don't think about it.

942
00:45:13,634 --> 00:45:15,034
I just think about tomorrow.

943
00:45:16,663 --> 00:45:18,050
(dramatic music)

944
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,670
- [Jack] Well, is there a ransom request?

945
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:21,150
- None so far.

946
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:23,294
- Then what's the kidnapper's motive?

947
00:45:23,294 --> 00:45:26,130
- It just happened when Lowman's
stolen car ran out of gas,

948
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:28,190
the new car had a girl in it.

949
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:30,070
- I'll get to you in a minute.

950
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:31,930
I trust you've got all your resources

951
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:33,030
on this case, Sheriff, yes?

952
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,090
- Well, because we're not
a big city department,

953
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:36,740
doesn't mean we're a bunch of hicks.

954
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,430
- Glad to hear that.

955
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:40,340
Specifics would be nice.

956
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,560
- Well, fine.

957
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,480
I put out a BOLO alert and-
- Good.

958
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,430
- Called in all off duty personnel,

959
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:46,660
engaged the state police,

960
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,250
and we start our search
parties at first light.

961
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,440
- While we're standing here,

962
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,960
Lowman could be getting farther away.

963
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,300
The victim is diabetic.

964
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,620
Her condition is severe

965
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:56,602
if she doesn't have these injections.

966
00:45:56,602 --> 00:45:57,750
- I am sorry to hear that,

967
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:01,580
but you were on departmental leave, yes?

968
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:02,890
- That ended a week ago.

969
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:05,970
I asked the SAC for more
time and it was granted.

970
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:07,470
- Oh, so, you were freelancing?

971
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:10,230
You were tracking Lowman like vigilante?

972
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:12,600
- As soon as I assessed
the situation I called

973
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,680
the Field Office, which
is why you're here.

974
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,610
- Look, would somebody just
tell me who is in charge here.

975
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,590
- Yes, that would be me.

976
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:24,630
- If anybody knows Lowman, it is me.

977
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:27,070
I've already set everything in motion.

978
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:30,590
- You had your opportunity
to take him out, Saunders,

979
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:33,010
and you failed and an agent was killed.

980
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:34,630
- I need to see this to the end.

981
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:36,530
Don't take me off this, Bryant.

982
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:37,943
I'm asking you not to.

983
00:46:39,454 --> 00:46:41,300
- You know, I've had a long drive.

984
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,840
We'll reconvene in the morning.

985
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,591
- In the morning?

986
00:46:44,591 --> 00:46:46,580
A young girl's life is
hanging in the balance.

987
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:48,950
Her health is going downhill fast.

988
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:50,040
- Well, you've said that you have

989
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,890
a search party organized for first light.

990
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:54,350
We'll reconvene then and you'll

991
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:56,400
bring me totally up to speed.

992
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,880
I'm gonna be calling the
SAC now and I will tell them

993
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,080
that you will be reporting
for reassignment.

994
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,970
- You're making a mistake, Bryant.

995
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:06,743
- You already made yours.

996
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:10,713
You shoulda been suspended or worse.

997
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:13,063
Goodnight.

998
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,373
- Dammit.

999
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:19,190
There's a young girl's life in jeopardy

1000
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:23,420
and what we don't need
here is an FBI turf war.

1001
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:25,030
- There is none.

1002
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:25,863
It's over.

1003
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,033
(thunder booming)

1004
00:47:29,033 --> 00:47:32,283
(light dramatic music)

1005
00:47:37,042 --> 00:47:42,042
- I need to know when one of
these cars is gonna be the law.

1006
00:47:45,138 --> 00:47:49,070
We're gonna have to
stay off the main roads.

1007
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:50,053
- Going where?

1008
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:52,162
- You'll see.

1009
00:47:54,543 --> 00:47:55,410
You're not gonna go and get sick

1010
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:59,413
like you said you were going to, are you?

1011
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:01,850
- If I don't get my insulin, I will.

1012
00:48:04,628 --> 00:48:07,659
(dramatic music)

1013
00:48:07,659 --> 00:48:10,409
(rain pattering)

1014
00:48:15,711 --> 00:48:20,711
(bag rustling)
(somber music)

1015
00:48:21,329 --> 00:48:23,996
(keys jingling)

1016
00:48:28,446 --> 00:48:29,878
(beer bottle clanking)

1017
00:48:29,878 --> 00:48:33,045
(carbonation hissing)

1018
00:48:41,246 --> 00:48:44,060
(dramatic music)

1019
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,230
- There's no rear entrance.

1020
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:48,500
If Lowman shows there's only
one way in and one way out.

1021
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,830
- Well, who's that?

1022
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:51,223
Lowman usually works alone.

1023
00:48:54,463 --> 00:48:57,063
- That could be him with
the beanie and the glasses.

1024
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:01,560
- Dispatch, this is 852.

1025
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,760
We're at TriState National,

1026
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,326
3rd and Melvo, requesting backup.

1027
00:49:05,326 --> 00:49:08,076
(dramatic music)

1028
00:49:18,177 --> 00:49:21,046
(sirens wailing)

1029
00:49:21,046 --> 00:49:22,846
Federal Agents, hold it right there!

1030
00:49:24,056 --> 00:49:26,577
(phone ringing)

1031
00:49:26,577 --> 00:49:28,685
- [Man] In the Windy City,
more of your favorite

1032
00:49:28,685 --> 00:49:30,326
blues all night.

1033
00:49:30,326 --> 00:49:32,825
It's after midnight and
we're heading into the vault

1034
00:49:32,825 --> 00:49:35,412
with some classics chords from the boys,

1035
00:49:35,412 --> 00:49:37,273
and a few jam sessions, my favorite.

1036
00:49:38,539 --> 00:49:40,486
(phone ringing)

1037
00:49:40,486 --> 00:49:42,210
You got something on your mind?

1038
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:44,528
You pick up the phone
and give Papa G a call.

1039
00:49:44,528 --> 00:49:46,437
If you know what the blues are tonight,

1040
00:49:46,437 --> 00:49:50,604
keep it here, keep it tight
on the G-spot tonight.

1041
00:49:51,508 --> 00:49:52,540
- [Man] Falling with it, haze.

1042
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:53,710
Hey, listen, while you're on the road,

1043
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:56,130
keep an eye out for that stolen black SUV.

1044
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:58,480
We're heading into our number 10.

1045
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,477
Still no word on the young-

1046
00:50:01,561 --> 00:50:04,311
(dramatic music)

1047
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:12,480
- [Mark] Federal Agents,
hold it right there.

1048
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,680
Don't do it, Lowman,
you got no where to go.

1049
00:50:16,548 --> 00:50:21,548
(woman screaming)
(suspenseful music)

1050
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:25,923
(gunshot banging)

1051
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:33,003
(gunshot banging)

1052
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:37,438
(muffled woman screaming)

1053
00:50:37,438 --> 00:50:40,105
(Megan panting)

1054
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,960
(gunshot banging)
(Mark groaning)

1055
00:50:46,267 --> 00:50:49,100
(gunshot banging)

1056
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:54,689
- Take the shot, Meg.

1057
00:50:54,689 --> 00:50:58,468

Take the shot!

1058
00:50:58,468 --> 00:51:01,530
(gunshot banging)

1059
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:02,697
Take the shot!

1060
00:51:03,616 --> 00:51:06,948
- I don't have a direct line of fire.

1061
00:51:06,948 --> 00:51:11,948

1062
00:51:14,519 --> 00:51:17,186

1063
00:51:23,308 --> 00:51:24,141
Mark!

1064
00:51:27,858 --> 00:51:30,119
- [Man] 101.1, you got
the bro on the radio.

1065
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:31,960
Windy City tonight, Danline Expressway

1066
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,461
is now a mess with construction.

1067
00:51:33,461 --> 00:51:34,909
You construction guys, come on,

1068
00:51:34,909 --> 00:51:36,760
how many coffee breaks
do you need out there?

1069
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,427

- Hi, Dad.

1076
00:52:13,743 --> 00:52:15,573
Mind if I invade your space?

1077
00:52:16,787 --> 00:52:18,391
- Please.

1078
00:52:18,391 --> 00:52:21,440
As long as you don't preach
to me like you used to.

1079
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,340
- I never thought I'd hear back from you.

1080
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:26,493
- Well, I've been busy lately.

1081
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:30,358
- Still going to meetings I hope?

1082
00:52:30,358 --> 00:52:32,393
- 96 days sober.

1083
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:36,100
Headed for my personal best.

1084
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,950
- What are the Vegas odds on that?

1085
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:39,663
- Better than the money on you.

1086
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,713
I hear you stepped in it.

1087
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,913
- I hesitated when I
shoulda pulled the trigger.

1088
00:52:50,369 --> 00:52:55,369
(gunshot banging)
(somber music)

1089
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:57,703
- It was a civilian or your partner.

1090
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:01,770
- My partner.
- It's okay.

1091
00:53:02,998 --> 00:53:05,747
It's gonna be okay.
- Hold on, Mark, hold on.

1092
00:53:05,747 --> 00:53:08,638
(somber music)

1093
00:53:08,638 --> 00:53:11,221
(Megan crying)

1094
00:53:20,877 --> 00:53:22,253
And I hit a wall.

1095
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:25,333
Now I'm being hounded by Jack Bryant.

1096
00:53:27,975 --> 00:53:28,808
- Oh.

1097
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:34,453
He made a name for himself with
some major busts earlier on.

1098
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:38,893
Media darling for a New York minute.

1099
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,810
Riding their pony ever since.

1100
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:45,763
He's um, morally bankrupt.

1101
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,373
Has fans in management.

1102
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,520
- Well, Mark was killed and he was-

1103
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:57,950
- His son-in-law.
- Ex son-in-law.

1104
00:53:57,950 --> 00:53:59,000
How do you know that?

1105
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:05,940
- The Bureau used to be
built on honor and integrity.

1106
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:14,807
Still good people there and
some remember my number.

1107
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:22,470
- Jack Bryant's wrong about me.

1108
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:25,520
- From his point of view
you're a homewrecker.

1109
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,800
And you got his son-in-law killed.

1110
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,100
- That's not what happened.

1111
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,960
They were separated.

1112
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:35,293
- Megan, your pain
doesn't matter to Bryant.

1113
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:37,783
He has too much of his own.

1114
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:43,979
(Megan sighs)

1115
00:54:43,979 --> 00:54:45,969
- Why can't I get over this?

1116
00:54:45,969 --> 00:54:49,219
(light dramatic music)

1117
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:55,653
I thought while I'm in town
maybe we can do this again.

1118
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:58,889
I could even give you a lift home.

1119
00:54:58,889 --> 00:55:02,960
- Next thing you know you'd
be sending Christmas cards,

1120
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,063
and who knows where that would lead.

1121
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:12,633
- Yeah, who knows.

1122
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:20,899
(register dinging)
- No.

1123
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:27,153
This Lowman, he's got you hooked, huh?

1124
00:55:27,153 --> 00:55:29,520
- I just, I have to find him.

1125
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,587
- Go back to the file.

1126
00:55:31,587 --> 00:55:35,040
Go over it, go over it again.

1127
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,307
There's always something you missed.

1128
00:55:37,307 --> 00:55:38,140
Always.

1129
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:39,540
- Well, go over it for what?

1130
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,050
I'm done, I'm toast.

1131
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:42,680
- How much do you want this?

1132
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,200
- I wanted it bad, for Mark.

1133
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,143
- I could make a call above Bryant.

1134
00:55:49,307 --> 00:55:52,809
- Well, I've never asked you
for anything before, Dad.

1135
00:55:52,809 --> 00:55:54,800
I'm not gonna ask now.

1136
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,250
- I guess that makes us even.

1137
00:55:57,973 --> 00:56:01,147
Because I've never given you anything.

1138
00:56:01,147 --> 00:56:04,397
(light dramatic music)

1139
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:17,240
(birds chirping)

1140
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:26,440
(car door slamming)

1141
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:31,427
- Usually works alone, but
not on the TriState Bank job.

1142
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,550
We engaged with his accomplice,

1143
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:37,390
Mark is hit while I'm radioing.

1144
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:40,493
Lowman and his accomplice
escape in separate vehicles.

1145
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:47,670
- [Donald] There's always
something you've missed.

1146
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:48,503
Always.

1147
00:56:53,218 --> 00:56:54,960
(Megan sighs)
(light dramatic music)

1148
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,533
- Known associates.

1149
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:03,550
Farrah Wyatt, Daniel Campos A.K.A Frogman,

1150
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:05,653
Victor Kirk A.K.A. Captain Kirk.

1151
00:57:13,159 --> 00:57:14,370
(phone beeping)

1152
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:16,510
Franklyn, Meg Saunders.

1153
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:17,730
I need a favor.

1154
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:19,940
I gave Sheriff a copy of Lowman's file

1155
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,640
and there's a list of known associates.

1156
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:25,190
I need to run locations on them.

1157
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:26,023
When?

1158
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,083
And word on Amy?

1159
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:31,006
Where are you?

1160
00:57:31,006 --> 00:57:36,006
(light dramatic music)
(body bag zipper buzzing)

1161
00:57:43,049 --> 00:57:45,882
(camera clicking)

1162
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:51,900
- We're certain this is the
station Amy made the call from.

1163
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:52,733
- How certain?

1164
00:57:52,733 --> 00:57:53,850
- This is where we found her cell phone.

1165
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:56,503
- Yeah, the night manager was shot inside.

1166
00:57:57,539 --> 00:58:00,253
He was just a kid, looked
like he didn't have a chance.

1167
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:03,030
- There's a security camera right there.

1168
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:04,070
Is there one inside?

1169
00:58:04,070 --> 00:58:05,980
- Yeah, we've already pulled the tapes.

1170
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:08,050
- And there's a monitor, too.

1171
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:10,290
- You know, I had just
about given up on you.

1172
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:12,720
Something told me you
wouldn't go away quietly.

1173
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,150
- Where's Bryant.

1174
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:16,971
- Spoke to him after
Franklyn talked to you.

1175
00:58:16,971 --> 00:58:18,521
Thought we owed you a heads up.

1176
00:58:20,342 --> 00:58:23,259
(tires screeching)

1177
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:25,803
Ut oh.

1178
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:32,090
- I thought we had your bacon settled?

1179
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:34,863
- What are you gonna
do, Bryant, arrest me?

1180
00:58:34,863 --> 00:58:37,510
- Well, you are impeding a
Federal investigation, Saunders.

1181
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:39,820
- No, you are standing
in the way of our finding

1182
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:42,590
a kidnapped girl with a medical emergency.

1183
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,470
If this girl dies I'll make certain

1184
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:46,410
my report details your interference.

1185
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:49,170
Including a catnap you
took when those hours

1186
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:50,062
could have made a difference.

1187
00:58:50,062 --> 00:58:51,362
(phone ringing)
- Bryant.

1188
00:58:54,402 --> 00:58:55,923
Yes, I'll wait.

1189
00:58:58,091 --> 00:58:59,853
SA Jack Bryant here, sir.

1190
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:02,343
I understand.

1191
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:05,850
Of course I understand.

1192
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:08,050
Crucial it is to finding
this kidnap victim.

1193
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:12,220
Agent Saunders' input
is definitely welcome.

1194
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:13,110
We're on this together.

1195
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:16,093
In fact, we're sharing a
significant lead as I speak.

1196
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:21,370
Thank you, sir, for your support.

1197
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:22,920
I really, really appreciate it.

1198
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:29,020
It must be nice having
friends in high places, huh?

1199
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:29,960
Is that what you do?

1200
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,410
- You know, maybe somebody just recognized

1201
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:34,980
the important thing here
is finding Amy Kennedy.

1202
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:36,950
- Couldn't agree more, what have you got?

1203
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:38,740
- Franklyn, cue up the tapes and let's go.

1204
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:41,911
- Let's go.
(light dramatic music)

1205
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:44,578
(door creaking)

1206
00:59:47,279 --> 00:59:49,770
(crows cawing)

1207
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:53,020
(light dramatic music)

1208
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:57,350
- She doesn't look like she's
under any duress at all.

1209
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:59,760
She could be with him willingly.

1210
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,930
- She could be afraid of him,

1211
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,580
and in that case she would
do exactly as he says.

1212
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:04,880
It could be the Patty Hearst Syndrome,

1213
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,724
she could feel he's her only lifeline.

1214
01:00:07,724 --> 01:00:08,873
- She doesn't look very sick to me.

1215
01:00:08,873 --> 01:00:10,573
- When I talked to her she was weak.

1216
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:12,000
- Really?
- She told her mother

1217
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,130
she wasn't feeling well.

1218
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:15,798
She hasn't had her last
insulin shot since yesterday.

1219
01:00:15,798 --> 01:00:17,770
- [Man] Hey, it's the bro at 101.1,

1220
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:18,930
seven o'clock in the Windy City.

1221
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:20,390
Report just in.

1222
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:23,957
A young gas attendant found
shot dead in Belgarde County.

1223
01:00:23,957 --> 01:00:28,957
This is a big story-
(flare hissing)

1224
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:35,510
Police have setup roadblocks
around the county.

1225
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:36,896
Asking for your support.

1226
01:00:36,896 --> 01:00:37,729
- We're gonna need to make a detour.

1227
01:00:37,729 --> 01:00:39,330
- If you've seen an SUV,
it could be burgundy,

1228
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:41,637
it could be black, white male.

1229
01:00:41,637 --> 01:00:44,304
(flare hissing)

1230
01:00:46,675 --> 01:00:48,176
Trust me, guys.

1231
01:00:48,176 --> 01:00:49,333
Do not go anywhere near this man-

1232
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:51,283
- What's the matter with you?
- Because he's considered

1233
01:00:51,283 --> 01:00:53,896
armed and very dangerous.
- I'm tired and I'm thirsty.

1234
01:00:53,896 --> 01:00:55,645
(glucometer beeping)

1235
01:00:55,645 --> 01:00:57,032
- Let me see.

1236
01:00:57,032 --> 01:00:59,045
What's that mean?

1237
01:00:59,045 --> 01:00:59,883
- My blood sugar's too high.

1238
01:01:03,384 --> 01:01:05,334
- Here, you should drink.

1239
01:01:05,334 --> 01:01:06,565
Drink some of this.

1240
01:01:06,565 --> 01:01:07,398
Have some of it.

1241
01:01:07,398 --> 01:01:10,092
Come on, come on, you
said you were thirsty.

1242
01:01:10,092 --> 01:01:11,009
Drink, hey!

1243
01:01:16,971 --> 01:01:17,923
You need one of those injections.

1244
01:01:17,923 --> 01:01:19,662
That's what you need.

1245
01:01:19,662 --> 01:01:24,662
(light dramatic music)
(car engine rumbling)

1246
01:01:25,955 --> 01:01:28,705
(birds chirping)

1247
01:01:31,572 --> 01:01:33,347
(somber music)

1248
01:01:33,347 --> 01:01:36,240
- The kid behind the counter
is frightened of Lowman.

1249
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,693
- Yeah, that's him showing
the gun under the shirt.

1250
01:01:44,970 --> 01:01:46,270
- Amy's gone during this?

1251
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:47,820
- Yeah, he let her walk out the door.

1252
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:48,653
- She could've run.

1253
01:01:48,653 --> 01:01:49,549
That's when you gotta run.

1254
01:01:49,549 --> 01:01:50,720
- There is no place for miles.
- She could've run.

1255
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:51,913
- And she is weak.

1256
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,330
- Well, that explains
why we found the phone.

1257
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:57,570
- It doesn't explain where she is

1258
01:01:57,570 --> 01:01:59,024
and we are running out of time.

1259
01:01:59,024 --> 01:02:00,192
- All right.

1260
01:02:00,192 --> 01:02:01,970
- [Newsman] The disappearance
of a Belgarde girl

1261
01:02:01,970 --> 01:02:03,980
remains a mystery this morning.

1262
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:06,750
Amy Kennedy, a junior
at Belgarde high school

1263
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:09,720
was abducted at gunpoint late last night

1264
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,760
by a John Carl Lowman.

1265
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,390
Lowman is a suspect in
the coldblooded murder

1266
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:15,460
of a Belgarde gas station-
- Unbelievable.

1267
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:17,830
- [Newsman] Manager off
the north south interstate.

1268
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:20,270
He's also wanted for a shooting
death of a federal agent

1269
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:23,936
during a bank robbery several
months ago near Chicago.

1270
01:02:23,936 --> 01:02:25,730
You know, we do a feature
on the radio program.

1271
01:02:25,730 --> 01:02:27,450
You know it's 101 with the brother.

1272
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:28,420
We have a tool of the day.

1273
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:31,520
This guy has got to be
the tool of the day.

1274
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,760
Put him in the toolbox, man.

1275
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,090
God, this whole entire town
is going crazy over this.

1276
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:38,079
We gotta get in to see one his-

1277
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:43,079
(horse neighing)
(light dramatic music)

1278
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:53,883
- What's going on here?

1279
01:02:53,883 --> 01:02:54,790
- This girl's sick.

1280
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:57,123
- Oh, I'm Dr. Lycar.

1281
01:02:57,123 --> 01:02:58,740
This is a veterinary
clinic, not a hospital.

1282
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,840
- Yeah, she needs
insulin, you got insulin?

1283
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,730
- Yeah, I mean, for the care of animals.

1284
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:04,317
But it's an emergency supply, so.

1285
01:03:04,317 --> 01:03:06,660
- If she doesn't take her
insulin, she's gonna die.

1286
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:07,910
So I'd say that's an
emergency wouldn't you?

1287
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:09,330
(horse neighing)

1288
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:10,477
- I'm sorry, I can't help you.

1289
01:03:10,477 --> 01:03:11,880
I'm not licensed for what you...

1290
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,772
Aw, man.
(suspenseful music)

1291
01:03:13,772 --> 01:03:15,380
Hey, you know what, you don't understand

1292
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:17,320
because yes, I have
insulin, but it's in bulk.

1293
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:18,590
It's not in individual doses.

1294
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:22,090
And I don't know the patient's dosage.

1295
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:22,973
It could be more harmful for her-

1296
01:03:22,973 --> 01:03:25,643
- Look, I don't have
time to argue with you.

1297
01:03:25,643 --> 01:03:28,441
Where do you wanna do this?

1298
01:03:28,441 --> 01:03:30,963
- It's right in here.

1299
01:03:30,963 --> 01:03:33,713
(horse neighing)

1300
01:03:43,182 --> 01:03:46,432
(light dramatic music)

1301
01:03:51,543 --> 01:03:54,293
(horse neighing)

1302
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,120
- All right, so he arrives with the girl

1303
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,170
without warning and just breaks in?

1304
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:47,270
- According to Dr. Lycar's report,

1305
01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:48,880
he held a gun to the doctor

1306
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,630
and forced him to give
her the insulin shot.

1307
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:52,392
- [Jack] And he left with the same SUV?

1308
01:04:52,392 --> 01:04:54,640
- [Ray] Doctor gave me a
description, it's the same vehicle.

1309
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,520
- So, he kills a service
station manager for no reason,

1310
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:01,060
but risks getting caught
to get Amy insulin.

1311
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:02,470
Why?
- There is nothing about

1312
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:04,010
this guy that's made any sense so far.

1313
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:06,103
- Maybe he's formed an attachment to her?

1314
01:05:07,043 --> 01:05:09,130
- They could be miles from here by now.

1315
01:05:09,130 --> 01:05:11,190
- They could've been miles
right after the kidnapping.

1316
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:13,340
Instead he goes in almost a circle

1317
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:15,810
from the kidnapping to the gas station.

1318
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:16,860
- Yeah, it's as if he's-

1319
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:18,430
- He's like biding time.
- Right.

1320
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:19,263
- Why?

1321
01:05:19,263 --> 01:05:20,480
- Why is he here in the first place?

1322
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,710
Where was he headed?

1323
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:24,230
And then he breaks his pattern
and makes a direct line

1324
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:26,780
to the vet's office,
giving her the shot there.

1325
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:27,740
- Oh, before I forget.

1326
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:29,903
I was able to run last known associates.

1327
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:33,040
- Captain Kirk.

1328
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,580
- As in "Star Trek."

1329
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:35,700
- As in Victor Kirk.

1330
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:38,230
He served time with Lowman at Joliet.

1331
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:39,400
And he matches the description

1332
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,430
of the accomplice who
did the bank robbery.

1333
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:43,840
- Well, his last known
address was at Glendon Avenue.

1334
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,820
That's at the farm nearby the refinery.

1335
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:46,980
- Let's get back this, all right?

1336
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:49,510
So, from the service station to here.

1337
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:51,640
The route means he's going
north to the interstate.

1338
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,319
- Not necessarily, I have a hunch.

1339
01:05:53,319 --> 01:05:54,513
- No, no more hunches, Saunders.

1340
01:05:54,513 --> 01:05:55,870
- Just hear me out.

1341
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:57,560
The interstate runs north and south.

1342
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:59,340
What makes you so sure he's going north?

1343
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:00,192
- You wanna debate this?

1344
01:06:00,192 --> 01:06:01,700
Why is everything a debate with you?

1345
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:04,763
- There are hospitals and
pharmacies near to Chicago,

1346
01:06:04,763 --> 01:06:08,470
instead he risks getting caught
and gets the shot near here.

1347
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:09,510
- Well, you know what?

1348
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:11,250
Amy got her insulin, which gets her out

1349
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:12,893
of danger and buys us more time.

1350
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:15,911
- Only the doctor didn't
exactly know what he was doing,

1351
01:06:15,911 --> 01:06:17,580
and she could be in more danger.

1352
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:19,270
- You know, Saunders,
against my better judgment,

1353
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:20,820
I was ordered by my superiors

1354
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:23,000
to allow you into this
investigation again.

1355
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,230
You are not running the show.

1356
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,510
We are going north.

1357
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:26,990
- To the interstate?
- Exactly.

1358
01:06:26,990 --> 01:06:28,203
Is there any objections?

1359
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:30,530
- You're calling the shots, Agent Bryant.

1360
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:32,580
- All right, I want the State
Patrol to meet us there.

1361
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:34,349
Are you clear on all of this?

1362
01:06:34,349 --> 01:06:35,457
- I think I know where he's headed.

1363
01:06:35,457 --> 01:06:36,963
- Put it in your report.

1364
01:06:38,008 --> 01:06:38,841
Let's go.

1365
01:06:39,789 --> 01:06:41,450
(Ray sighs)

1366
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:45,080
- That guy has got all the
instincts of a blind squirrel.

1367
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,720
- I just wanna find Amy Kennedy.

1368
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,253
If he's right, I'm happy.

1369
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:53,480
- Right behind you, Sheriff.

1370
01:06:56,711 --> 01:07:00,000
Oh, wait, Megan, you're
not coming with us?

1371
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,940
- Bryant and I are just gonna
go back and forth like this.

1372
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:03,720
It's not gonna help us find her.

1373
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,400
- It's more than that.

1374
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,750
- I think I know why he's in Belgarde.

1375
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:09,330
- You figure it's to
hook up with this Kirk?

1376
01:07:09,330 --> 01:07:11,760
- That's why he's been here
all night treading water.

1377
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,343
- Yeah, but that's a lot of
trouble when you're on the run

1378
01:07:13,343 --> 01:07:14,920
just to hook up with an old buddy.

1379
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:18,280
- An accomplice, if Victor Kirk
was in on the bank robbery,

1380
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,160
the money was never recovered.

1381
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,790
- And you figure Kirk has it?

1382
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:25,961
- If he took off with the
money, it's over $200,000.

1383
01:07:25,961 --> 01:07:27,270
- Well, good luck to you.

1384
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:29,607
If you need anything
just radio us for backup.

1385
01:07:34,129 --> 01:07:37,881
(light dramatic music)
(birds chirping)

1386
01:07:37,881 --> 01:07:41,048
(car engine rumbling)

1387
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:42,913
- There.

1388
01:07:44,089 --> 01:07:47,191
What did I tell you, horses, huh?

1389
01:07:47,191 --> 01:07:48,441
There they are.

1390
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:51,173
What's the matter with you?

1391
01:07:51,173 --> 01:07:53,769
I thought, I thought you loved horses?

1392
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:54,852
- I do, I do.

1393
01:07:56,589 --> 01:07:59,289
- All right, you wanna, wanna
get out and take a look?

1394
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:03,187
- I can't, my legs hurt

1395
01:08:03,187 --> 01:08:05,353
and my eyes are getting really blurry.

1396
01:08:07,610 --> 01:08:09,663
- I thought you'd be okay
if you got your shot?

1397
01:08:10,951 --> 01:08:14,003
- It only worked for a while.
(glucometer beeping)

1398
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,373
My blood sugar's gone down again.

1399
01:08:23,841 --> 01:08:24,845
- You know what?

1400
01:08:24,845 --> 01:08:27,153
Here, we're gonna take care of that.

1401
01:08:28,837 --> 01:08:29,960
But first I'm gonna have a little talk

1402
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,788
with Kirk about a debt he owes me.

1403
01:08:31,788 --> 01:08:34,955
(car engine rumbling)

1404
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:41,799
(suspenseful music)

1405
01:08:54,746 --> 01:08:56,133
- [Newsman] There's a break
here up to the minute news

1406
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:57,476
to eight o'clock with the latest.

1407
01:08:57,476 --> 01:08:58,596
And Bob, my nextdoor neighbor,

1408
01:08:58,596 --> 01:09:01,252
please, what the heck was
going on there last night?

1409
01:09:01,252 --> 01:09:06,252
If you're still-
(dramatic music)

1410
01:09:19,767 --> 01:09:22,767
(suspenseful music)

1411
01:09:46,366 --> 01:09:50,116
- [Mark] Federal Agents,
hold it right there!

1412
01:09:53,113 --> 01:09:56,836
Don't do it, Lowman,
you got nowhere to run.

1413
01:09:56,836 --> 01:09:59,586
(dramatic music)

1414
01:10:14,396 --> 01:10:16,847
(gunshot banging)

1415
01:10:16,847 --> 01:10:20,087
(woman screaming)

1416
01:10:20,087 --> 01:10:25,087
(gunshot banging)
(Mark groaning)

1417
01:10:27,196 --> 01:10:32,196
(woman screaming)
(gunshots banging)

1418
01:10:37,436 --> 01:10:42,436
(Mark groaning)
(body thudding)

1419
01:10:43,137 --> 01:10:45,804
(Megan panting)

1420
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:55,955
(gunshot banging)
(metal clanking)

1421
01:10:56,777 --> 01:10:59,305
(woman whimpering)
(gunshot banging)

1422
01:10:59,305 --> 01:11:00,638
- The shot, Meg.

1423
01:11:03,004 --> 01:11:04,171
Take the shot.

1424
01:11:07,936 --> 01:11:10,924
- [Megan] I don't have
a direct line of fire!

1425
01:11:10,924 --> 01:11:13,107
(gunshot banging)

1426
01:11:13,107 --> 01:11:15,857
(dramatic music)

1427
01:11:25,389 --> 01:11:30,389
(heartbeat pounding)
(Mark sighs)

1428
01:11:33,345 --> 01:11:38,345
(Megan panting)
(somber music)

1429
01:11:50,322 --> 01:11:55,322
Mark!
(Mark groaning)

1430
01:12:04,032 --> 01:12:07,032
(suspenseful music)

1431
01:12:09,802 --> 01:12:11,719
Agent down, Agent down.

1432
01:12:16,192 --> 01:12:17,942
Help is coming, Mark.

1433
01:12:20,362 --> 01:12:25,362
(heartbeat pounding)
(Mark sighs)

1434
01:12:30,549 --> 01:12:35,549
(birds chirping)
(light dramatic music)

1435
01:13:02,410 --> 01:13:07,410
(door creaking)
(suspenseful music)

1436
01:13:16,042 --> 01:13:17,872
(glucometer ringing)

1437
01:13:17,872 --> 01:13:19,213
(beer splashing)

1438
01:13:19,213 --> 01:13:21,880
(Kirk spitting)

1439
01:13:24,544 --> 01:13:26,211
- John, is that you?

1440
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,977
- I came for what you owe me.

1441
01:13:32,197 --> 01:13:33,280
- Who's that?

1442
01:13:36,016 --> 01:13:38,494
- Nevermind about her.

1443
01:13:38,494 --> 01:13:39,736
- She looks real bad.

1444
01:13:39,736 --> 01:13:40,936
And what's that beeping?

1445
01:13:40,936 --> 01:13:42,151
(gun clicks)
- The money, Kirk.

1446
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:45,151
(suspenseful music)

1447
01:13:48,677 --> 01:13:51,026
(Kirk stuttering)

1448
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:53,401
- I didn't think you
were coming back, Johnny.

1449
01:13:53,401 --> 01:13:56,401
(suspenseful music)

1450
01:13:58,104 --> 01:14:00,353
- I didn't call you
'cause I didn't trust you.

1451
01:14:02,082 --> 01:14:04,332
Now, you wouldn't be trying

1452
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,230
to shaft me out of my split, would you?

1453
01:14:10,097 --> 01:14:10,930
- No, please.

1454
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:15,955
I got your money, all right?

1455
01:14:15,955 --> 01:14:17,455
But, but not here.

1456
01:14:19,314 --> 01:14:22,053
I wouldn't be that dumb.

1457
01:14:22,053 --> 01:14:22,886
- Where?

1458
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:26,275
- Hidden where no one can find it.

1459
01:14:26,275 --> 01:14:27,108
- Oh.

1460
01:14:27,108 --> 01:14:28,093
- Your share and mine.

1461
01:14:29,363 --> 01:14:33,226
I, I can show you where it-

1462
01:14:33,226 --> 01:14:38,226
- Tell me first.
(glucometer beeping)

1463
01:14:41,003 --> 01:14:43,503
(Megan sighs)

1464
01:14:46,923 --> 01:14:49,506
(gun clicking)

1465
01:14:51,344 --> 01:14:54,344
(suspenseful music)

1466
01:15:06,133 --> 01:15:08,723
(gunshot banging)
(horse neighing)

1467
01:15:08,723 --> 01:15:13,723
(birds chirping)
(horses neighing)

1468
01:15:22,653 --> 01:15:25,653
(car door slamming)

1469
01:15:30,635 --> 01:15:32,963
(horse neighing)

1470
01:15:32,963 --> 01:15:36,213
(light dramatic music)

1471
01:16:01,621 --> 01:16:04,704
(glucometer beeping)

1472
01:16:12,207 --> 01:16:15,207
(suspenseful music)

1473
01:16:22,168 --> 01:16:27,168
(door creaking)
(door thudding)

1474
01:16:29,698 --> 01:16:34,698
(glucometer beeping)
(dramatic music)

1475
01:16:44,658 --> 01:16:46,570
- Move and you're dead.

1476
01:16:46,570 --> 01:16:48,450
- I need to do this.

1477
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:49,453
I need to do it now.

1478
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:53,180
- You're that agent I
talked to on the phone.

1479
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:54,780
- She'll die if I don't do this.

1480
01:16:56,590 --> 01:16:59,113
- Look, you don't do
nothin' unless I say you do.

1481
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:02,350
- Her blood sugar is dangerously low.

1482
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:03,736
I need to give her this shot.

1483
01:17:03,736 --> 01:17:05,093
- I already gave her a shot.

1484
01:17:05,093 --> 01:17:06,800
- That was insulin.

1485
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:07,953
She needs glucose.

1486
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:11,770
Hang on.

1487
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:13,470
It's Megan, I talked to you on the phone.

1488
01:17:13,470 --> 01:17:14,373
Can you hear me?

1489
01:17:15,517 --> 01:17:16,350
- Wait a second, wait a second,

1490
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:18,823
I said you don't do
anything unless I say so.

1491
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:22,770
- You must care about her
or she would be dead by now.

1492
01:17:25,023 --> 01:17:26,336
- Is anyone here with you?

1493
01:17:26,336 --> 01:17:27,603
(glucometer beeping)

1494
01:17:27,603 --> 01:17:29,033
Answer me!
- No!

1495
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:31,333
No, I came here alone.

1496
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:35,593
If you shoot me she'll die.

1497
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:38,300
You need to let me give her

1498
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:40,483
this injection and get
her to the hospital.

1499
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,393
- Hey...

1500
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,003
I've seen you before.

1501
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:49,760
- I get that a lot.

1502
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:52,280
- No, no, no, no, no,
I've seen you before.

1503
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:54,493
Where was that?
- Let me concentrate.

1504
01:17:57,650 --> 01:17:58,483
- Fine.

1505
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:02,540
I'm leaving, but if you try to follow me,

1506
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:03,413
I will kill you.

1507
01:18:05,496 --> 01:18:08,579
(glucometer beeping)

1508
01:18:18,885 --> 01:18:20,776
(door creaking)

1509
01:18:20,776 --> 01:18:23,359
- Hey, Amy, it's gonna be okay.

1510
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:25,299
Amy, Amy?

1511
01:18:27,285 --> 01:18:28,585
Can you hear me?

1512
01:18:28,585 --> 01:18:31,335
(dramatic music)

1513
01:18:32,986 --> 01:18:35,569
(gun clicking)

1514
01:18:39,986 --> 01:18:42,103
(car door thudding)

1515
01:18:42,103 --> 01:18:45,270
(car engine rumbling)

1516
01:18:57,592 --> 01:19:00,342
(dramatic music)

1517
01:19:04,251 --> 01:19:06,313
(nails clipping)

1518
01:19:06,313 --> 01:19:08,890
(water dripping)

1519
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:10,410
Are you feeling better?

1520
01:19:10,410 --> 01:19:12,370
- Yeah, thanks.

1521
01:19:12,370 --> 01:19:13,203
Did you tell my parents.

1522
01:19:13,203 --> 01:19:15,620
- I'm gonna call them right now.

1523
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:16,593
Did he hurt you?

1524
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:19,853
- No, he was actually okay to me.

1525
01:19:21,550 --> 01:19:24,350
But I know he did other things
and you let him get away.

1526
01:19:25,790 --> 01:19:27,980
- You are what's important, Amy.

1527
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:29,880
We can always catch up with him later.

1528
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:33,390
Did he say where he was going?

1529
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:41,040
- He's going after some money.

1530
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:44,250
I heard the other guy say that
it was at the old refinery.

1531
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:45,103
- Anything else?

1532
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:48,769
- Something about a heating vent.

1533
01:19:48,769 --> 01:19:52,243
(water dripping)

1534
01:19:52,243 --> 01:19:54,993
(dramatic music)

1535
01:20:10,233 --> 01:20:13,233
(car door slamming)

1536
01:20:20,731 --> 01:20:23,314
(gun clicking)

1537
01:20:30,453 --> 01:20:33,703
(muffled police radio)

1538
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:36,600
- Your parents are gonna
meet you at the hospital

1539
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:37,990
and I'll check on you later.

1540
01:20:37,990 --> 01:20:39,453
- Thanks.

1541
01:20:39,453 --> 01:20:40,780
Be careful.

1542
01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:41,830
- I will, sweetheart.

1543
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:47,070
- Are you gonna hurt him?

1544
01:20:48,272 --> 01:20:49,272
- [Woman] 2214, Tom.

1545
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:52,450
- Bryant.

1546
01:20:52,450 --> 01:20:54,080
- Go ahead.

1547
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,740
- I found Amy, she's on
her way to the hospital.

1548
01:20:56,740 --> 01:20:57,810
She's gonna be okay.

1549
01:20:57,810 --> 01:21:00,870
- Wait, wait, you went
in alone, without backup?

1550
01:21:00,870 --> 01:21:02,840
That's totally against protocol.

1551
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:05,010
- She was virtually comatose.

1552
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:06,390
- And Lowman?

1553
01:21:06,390 --> 01:21:08,180
- He's on his way to the old refinery.

1554
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:09,567
- All right, Saunders,
you hold your position.

1555
01:21:09,567 --> 01:21:10,400
Did you hear me?

1556
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,900
We will contain the area.

1557
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:14,150
I will organize a SWAT team, over.

1558
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:16,010
- There's no time, over and out.

1559
01:21:16,010 --> 01:21:16,843
- Saunders!

1560
01:21:18,001 --> 01:21:19,001
(gun clicks)

1561
01:21:19,001 --> 01:21:20,057
Turn it around.

1562
01:21:20,057 --> 01:21:22,143
We're going the wrong way.

1563
01:21:23,871 --> 01:21:26,788
(tires screeching)

1564
01:21:29,591 --> 01:21:32,341
(dramatic music)

1565
01:21:48,601 --> 01:21:51,601
(suspenseful music)

1566
01:21:52,833 --> 01:21:55,583
(dramatic music)

1567
01:22:04,652 --> 01:22:07,402
(metal clanking)

1568
01:22:09,940 --> 01:22:13,190
(light dramatic music)

1569
01:22:19,492 --> 01:22:22,909
(metal walkway clanking)

1570
01:22:56,281 --> 01:22:58,948
(John groaning)

1571
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:10,773
(pliers clicking)

1572
01:23:14,681 --> 01:23:18,098
(metal walkway clanking)

1573
01:23:21,751 --> 01:23:26,751
(air vent rattling)
(light dramatic music)

1574
01:23:30,151 --> 01:23:31,823
(bag rustling)

1575
01:23:31,823 --> 01:23:34,183
(metal walkway clanking)

1576
01:23:34,183 --> 01:23:36,933
(money thudding)

1577
01:23:39,052 --> 01:23:41,292
(money rustling)

1578
01:23:41,292 --> 01:23:43,961
(metal walkway clanking)

1579
01:23:43,961 --> 01:23:47,220
(suspenseful music)
- Lowman!

1580
01:23:47,220 --> 01:23:48,710
You helped saved Amy's life,

1581
01:23:48,710 --> 01:23:51,110
at first I thought about
cutting you some slack.

1582
01:23:52,324 --> 01:23:54,790
- But that's not in your nature, is it?

1583
01:23:54,790 --> 01:23:57,743
- Why did you take her with you?

1584
01:23:59,983 --> 01:24:02,600
- Who knows why we do what we do.

1585
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,130
- I think you took her for insurance.

1586
01:24:05,130 --> 01:24:07,930
You thought you wouldn't get
shot if she was in the car.

1587
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:10,353
- Yeah, whatever.

1588
01:24:10,353 --> 01:24:13,003
- But then things started to change.

1589
01:24:13,003 --> 01:24:14,580
You started to care for her, didn't you?

1590
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:17,680
- You know what, think
what you wanna think.

1591
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:18,513
Okay?

1592
01:24:19,604 --> 01:24:21,504
But that's not why you're here, is it?

1593
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:27,420
- I'm here to take you in
for robbery and murder.

1594
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:29,593
You shot and killed my partner!

1595
01:24:30,993 --> 01:24:32,743
- Now you wanna kill me, don't you?

1596
01:24:35,023 --> 01:24:36,791
(suspenseful music)

1597
01:24:36,791 --> 01:24:38,958
You know it was me or him.

1598
01:24:43,212 --> 01:24:44,911
And now it's you or me.

1599
01:24:44,911 --> 01:24:49,900
(suspenseful music)
(gunshot banging)

1600
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:52,567
(door creaking)

1601
01:25:00,519 --> 01:25:03,769
(light dramatic music)

1602
01:25:09,031 --> 01:25:11,614
(John panting)

1603
01:25:21,212 --> 01:25:24,629
(metal walkway clanking)

1604
01:25:43,876 --> 01:25:47,209
(light dramatic music)

1605
01:26:00,174 --> 01:26:04,583
(Megan sniffling)
(metal walkway clanking)

1606
01:26:04,583 --> 01:26:07,833
(light dramatic music)

1607
01:26:27,375 --> 01:26:28,735
(gunshot banging)
(Megan gasps)

1608
01:26:28,735 --> 01:26:31,485
(dramatic music)

1609
01:26:35,904 --> 01:26:38,237
- [Mark] Take the shot, Meg!

1610
01:26:39,783 --> 01:26:40,950
Take the shot!

1611
01:26:43,973 --> 01:26:47,504
(suspenseful music)

1612
01:26:47,504 --> 01:26:50,421
(gunshots banging)

1613
01:26:52,973 --> 01:26:55,640
(John groaning)

1614
01:27:03,584 --> 01:27:06,251
(body thudding)

1615
01:27:28,213 --> 01:27:33,213
(gravel crunching)
(car engine rumbling)

1616
01:27:33,314 --> 01:27:38,314
(birds squawking)
(frogs croaking)

1617
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:49,214
(water splashing)

1618
01:27:49,214 --> 01:27:51,714
(light music)

1619
01:27:54,728 --> 01:27:55,561
- Oh.

1620
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:12,933
(Donald groaning)

1621
01:28:16,339 --> 01:28:18,839
(Megan sighs)

1622
01:28:20,811 --> 01:28:23,600
This could set a very bad precedence.

1623
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,550
- All I had to do was
call the county tax roll

1624
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:27,683
and find out where you lived.

1625
01:28:33,470 --> 01:28:37,170
- Well, uh, don't just stand there.

1626
01:28:37,170 --> 01:28:40,782
Grab a pole and the bait box.

1627
01:28:40,782 --> 01:28:43,282
(light music)

1628
01:28:54,872 --> 01:28:57,705
(water splashing)

1629
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:05,410
The girl is okay?

1630
01:29:05,410 --> 01:29:10,120
- She's lucky to be alive.
(fishing reel clicking)

1631
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:12,603
- Ballistics, they come through?

1632
01:29:14,030 --> 01:29:16,530
- The bullets taken from
the gas station manager

1633
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:19,803
and Victor Kirk match the
bullets taken from Mark.

1634
01:29:21,290 --> 01:29:23,343
- How do you feel about it?

1635
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:25,690
- What?

1636
01:29:25,690 --> 01:29:29,120
- Being able to pull the
trigger when you had to.

1637
01:29:32,121 --> 01:29:33,290
(Megan sighs)

1638
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:35,340
- I thought it would make me feel better.

1639
01:29:37,632 --> 01:29:38,465
- And now?

1640
01:29:39,771 --> 01:29:41,938
- I don't know how I feel.

1641
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:45,993
Like I finished a job, you know,

1642
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:50,291
sense of completion but nothing more.

1643
01:29:50,291 --> 01:29:51,600
- Good.

1644
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,491
That's how you're supposed to feel.

1645
01:29:53,491 --> 01:29:56,824
(fishing reel clicking)

1646
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:02,000
- I could get used to it.

1647
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,072
- Oh, don't, please.

1648
01:30:04,072 --> 01:30:05,970
(Megan laughing)

1649
01:30:05,970 --> 01:30:07,860
Who knows where that could lead.

1650
01:30:09,410 --> 01:30:10,923
- Yeah, who knows.

1651
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:20,124
(gentle music)

1652
01:30:20,124 --> 01:30:24,543
(bird squawking)
(fishing reel clicking)

1653
01:30:24,543 --> 01:30:27,043
