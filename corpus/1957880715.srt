A Mexican tribe.

308
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,540
Let's see. They existed about a thousand years ago.

309

[Bill] So naturally she's attracted to them.

310
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:55,760
The Toltec's gods and myths formed the basis for much of the Aztec religion.

311
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,040
And Aztec noblemen often claimed a (indistinct) from the Toltecs.

00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:30,470

323
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,990
Maybe this is our chance to do him justice.

324
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:37,160

00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,620
You're sure? We didn't lose anything?

329
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,070
[Mike] Because that free style rap was flawless.

330
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,570
Better not be any glitches on that tape.

Let's do it.

334
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,230
What about that green video last week?

335
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,540
Tapes rolling.

336
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,960
[Kevin] He hears more about that green video

337
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,140
than Buckner heard about game six.

338
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,290
I think we were talking about the eagle symbol.

339
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,180
Yes eagles.

340
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,270
The eagles were the attendants of the gods of the daytime powers.

341
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:13,680
[Bill] Lash learned how to prep for interviews from Oliver Reed.

342
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,720
Four eagles?

343
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,140
There are four cardinal points on the compass.

344
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,490
And the number four is significant in American Indian culture.

345
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,770
[Mike] The ancient ones called it the Fab Four.

346
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,500
Christian faith.

347
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,460
Now their ritual calender, is divided into four equal parts.

348
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,130
Each one corresponding.

349
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,950
[Kevin] Why do they look so green? Oh crap!

350
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,260
The Toltecs.

351
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,000
Why was Cody so obsessed with the Toltecs?

352
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,550
They were from Mexico.

353
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,520
They didn't have anything to do with his heritage?

354
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,800
[Bill] Why can't people stick to their own kind, is what I'm asking.

355
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:53,380
He and many of the elders of his tribe believed in age-old myths or legends.

356
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,750
[Mike] Ugh. I cancelled the Ayatollah interview for THIS?

357
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,310
Brutal and outcast tribe moved far north.

358
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:03,790
And they said to have moved close to this community.

359
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,700
But we're hundreds and hundreds of miles.

360
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,280
Don't give me a lesson in geography.

361
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,150
[Kevin] My uncle was a Rand McNally!

362
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,610
Such a move.

363
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,440
But Cody believed the legend.

364
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,250
And on this very ground.

365
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,290
[Bill] Where I just spit out my gum.

366
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:23,360
That is, they worshiped from below.

367
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,550
Only the Toltec sorcerers were actually allowed to stand on the power spot.

368
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,620
Totem Hill.

369
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:33,270
[Mike] Do not open reporter until Christmas. (Kevin laughs)

370
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,970
They served the god of the nocturnal skies.

371
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,160
Who symbolize the destructive principles of the universe.

372
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,020
The dark powers.

373
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,020
[Kevin] Such as seals.

374
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,990
If it's alright with David, I'll read Cody's diary.

375
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,240
There might be something in there that would help your story.

376
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,380
[Bill] I could find out if he had a crush on me.

377
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,200
I mean help your story!

378
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,080
There is something you can do for me Miss Dalton.

379
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,710
Lunch, dinner?

380
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,160
My phone number?

381
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,590
No no. I was gonna tell you about the whip.

382
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,180
[Mike] Care to ghost write it?

383
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,590
I think that might just be a little  bit out of my field.

384
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,700
Oh no. This is a gift from Cody.

385
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,970
[Kevin] And I am not INTO you!

386
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,660
Gathered from the four quarters of the world.

387
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,480
And it's said to have power to protect.

388
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,400
[Bill] Guys keep pulling up Tim Burton's property markers.

389
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,770
I would like you to mention the whip was a gift from Cody to me in your story.

390
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:30,240
A symbol of homage from you to the spirit of John Cody.

391
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,990
Beautifully put.

392
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,260
[Mike] And that'll be my cue to pour out my forty.

393
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,770
(bell rings)

394
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,580
[Kevin] A lovely funeral was held for the news program's only viewer.

395
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,360
Who hung himself out of boredom.

396
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,720
(bell rings)

397
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,390
[Bill] Thank you for coming! Vote God! Thanks again!

398
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,690
Remember to vote God!

399
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,690
I'm afraid the preacher's sermon didn't do much to uplift your spirit Beth.

400
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,050
No it's not that.

401
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,340
It just that I hate the thought of trying to look for a new place next quarter.

402
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,720
I mean it's so much fun.

403
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,890
[Mike] I'm listening. No really.

404
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:09,080
It was the best time in my life.

405
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,450
And I'm sorry, but I refuse to commute.

406
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,250
Hey you make home sound like torture in comparison.

407
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,590
[Kevin] Now come on! mom's rectally feeding us chicken pot pie tonight!

408
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,420
and of course I had to get a high number.

409
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,120
Anyway 45 miles is too far away to commute.

410
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,420
Hey Beth! Heard you didn't make the cut.

411
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,150
Listen I'll let you borrow my pup tent okay?

412
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,000
You sarcastic little twerp!

413
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,300
[Bill] Didn't you learn anything from my freakin sermon!!!??

414
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,810
Why couldn't I have been born an only child?

415
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,130
Lynn you'll be looking for a room too, won't you?

416
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,990
Yeah, but. I don't care. I mean I didn't like the girls in my suite anyway.

417
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:42,110
[Mike] (slurring words) They said I was a boozier Sean Young.

418
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,900
Hey yeah! Beth I think I know just the thing! Come on!

419
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,220
Mary!

420
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,380
[Kevin] Walter Shobach before he went shabas.

421
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,320
Mary! Mary! Mary tell Beth about the house.

422
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,160
Hi! Beth!

423
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,730
How are you?

424
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,630
Just fine.  How long will you be in town?

425
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,740
[Bill] Ugh. Etiquette takes forever

426
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,080
Tomorrow afternoon.

427
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,080
You know newspeople never get any.

428
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,700
Tell her about the house Mary!

429
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,880
[Mike] What does it have? A water slide? Calm down!

430
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,460
I think you might like it.

431
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,040
The owner died about a month ago. It's like new.

432
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,650
Really new. It's really big!

433
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,990
And get a lot of girls in there. Be just like a sorority house.

434
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,950
Great! Tell me more about it.

435
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:20,860
[Kevin] Gah. Enough about this house! (Bill laughs)

436
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,480
It has weathered wood on the outside, four bedrooms, sunken tub.

437
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,800
[Bill] Wraith with tomahawks.

438
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,650
How did you find out about a place like this anyway?

439
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,480
Well I did a few news stories on him.

440
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,780
Yeah, yeah. Escorted by four indian sorcerers.

441
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,650
[Kevin] Like gag me with a peace pipe!

442
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,200
Garden. Indian sorcerers.

443
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,050
Yeah these four Toltec witch doctors types did some kind of magic.

444
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,830
Dark powers!

445
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,410
[Mike] Heh. And where's your room in relation to mine?

446
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,610
(laughing)  Is it safe to live in?

447
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:54,080
Well I hear that the landlord wants to dispel a lot of the myths so.

448
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,980
The rent should be low

449
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,990
[Kevin] The body count should be high.

450
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,630
Take a chance beth!

451
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,190
Come on! Take a chance!

452
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,610
♪♪♪

453
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,470
[Bill] And that once in a lifetime chance turned out to

454
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:12,710
be a beige ranch bungalow with three windows.

455
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:16,890
[Mike] Great. My coat matches the house!

456
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:20,620
♪♪♪

457
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,080
Whoa.

458
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,360
[Kevin] Unairated lawns give me the creeps.

459
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,480
(knocking)

460
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,790
[Bill] The frigid tundra that is south eastern United States.

461
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,300
Boo!

462
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,580
Hi Tammy.

463
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,940
Funny!

464
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,980
[Mike] Opening doors I just knocked on!

465
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,830
Girl you better watch out.

466
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,420
Honey Toltec sorcerers were bad dudes.

467
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,280
Tammy I never even heard of the Toltecs until Mary told me about the house.

468
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,230
You mean you didn't know about this place?

469
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,350
[Kevin] Don't you watch the community affairs type show

470
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,810
that runs at odd ball times on Saturdays? (Mike laughs)

471
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,280
Hey where's Susan?

472
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,410
She's in her room. You share?

473
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,020
Yeah but the owner wants two to a room. It's not that bad.

474
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,740
Come on. You'll love it. Come on!

475
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,310
[Bill] Don't let the door hit you on the way in!

476
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,260
You'll love it.

477
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,410
Already told Mr. Cody you were moving in and

478
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:14,390
can move in as soon as you pay your deposit.

479
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,790
[Mike] Well it does look like a good place for my door to door sales business.

480
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,920
Beth I really do feel like an outcast.

481
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,370
I mean this is the second year I didn't get a low number.

482
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:26,320
[Kevin] Why did I enroll in scarce housing university?

483
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,340
On everything. I mean my social life?

484
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,650
The total pits.

485
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:34,530
Beth I never dreamed I wouldn't get a room on campus this quarter.

486
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:38,650
[Bill] I was SO looking foward to getting policed by a power tripping RA.

487
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,870
Bring the men to where we are.

488
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:44,040
You talking MY kind of trash now lady!

489
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,650
[Mike] And over here is the gratuitous crotch room.

490
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,580
Oh geez would you look at this?

491
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,420
You'd think she was getting ready for a date with Tom Selleck.

492
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,120
[Kevin] Or whoever plays Higgins.

493
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,030
Tammy! Hey girl! How are you?

494
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,890
Fine and you?

495
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,200
Are you moving in today?

496
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,880
You kidding? The house on totem hill.

497
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,060
Uh oh. Come on, you'll love it.

498
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,740
Well that's what I hear. and by the look of this place.

499
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,310
[Bill] Man she suffers from renters schizophrenia.

500
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,000
So we got the big bedroom.

501
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,390
And you haven't even SEEN the fringe benefits yet.

502
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,320
Honey you're not gonna believe this.

503
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,740
Come on.

504
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,250
[Mike] You GOTTA see this Schlitz poster I found. It's out of this world.

505
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,090
Bath.

506
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,840
Ooooo whooo!

507
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,450
[Kevin] Fully carpeted bathroom? Whoo hoo!

508
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:32,400
Whoever stayed here was a really a Rockefeller in disguise.

509
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,960
Well no Tammy.

510
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,670
I think it just took it after the place was built.

511
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,700
Anyway come on. There's a lot more to see.

512
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,470
[Bill] If you think that tub was fancy you're gonna

513
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,920
flip over the spray hose on the kitchen sink!

514
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,390
[Kevin] Whoo hoo!

515
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:49,870
Would you check this cabinet space?

516
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:53,530
[Mike] AJAX? You sure this wasn't JP Morgan's old place?

517
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,100
Oh wow.

518
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,580
Hey Beth.

519
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,520
Where are we gonna put all the beer I'm gonna bring?

520
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,310
Tammy you would think of that.

521
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:03,120
[Kevin] You late stage alcoholic.

522
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,730
Okay great.

523
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,480
Oh we can take turns cooking huh?

524
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,920
Child. I make a mean lasagna!

525
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,260
[Bill] I mean really CRUEL! It finds your flaws and it doesn't let up.

526
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,590
Let me show you to your room.

527
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,990
Wait a minute Beth. All I said.

528
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,380
I know what you said Tammy. But you'll come around.

529
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:22,020
[Mike] Yeah Tammy. Just focus on the cabinet space!

530
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,050
Downstairs you have own choice of bedrooms.

531
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:30,650
Honey it is definitely better than the dorm rooms.

532
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,060
Isn't that the truth!

533
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,910
[Kevin] Don't you dare bad mouth the dorms! Sorry renter's schizophrenia again!

534
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,470
Nice.

535
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,790
No sunken bath tub but it'll suffice.

536
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,560
And over here.

537
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,200
[Bill] Is Tom Cruise wearing a Vince t-shirt.

538
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,210
Are you kidding? I hate pool.

539
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,920
Susan's a recreational freak around here.

540
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,780
Did you know it took ten guys to bring this ugly thing in here?

541
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,920
[Mike] Ten guys? Were they all Don Knots clones? (Kevin laughs)

542
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,990
Well I  like pool.

543
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,450
And here we have our own laundry room.

544
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:01,070
Complete with indian artifacts left by the previous owner.

545
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,260
[Kevin] some human remains, maybe a hot plate.

546
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,180
I don't know. I haven't looked through it yet.

547
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,980
But I've never seen them look like this before.

548
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:11,460
See usually the eagle is set up on top of a skull's head,

549
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,230
and it symbolizes good or evil.

550
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,100
[Bill] But we'll use it to clean the lint trap.

551
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,680
Honey I've heard a lot about this house.

552
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,690
That's why I'm not even for sure I want to stay here.

553
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,670
[Kevin] Oh come on. Our laundry room looks like a refugee.

554
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,970
And it smells like a fart!

555
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:30,120
[Bill] Well.

556
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,840
Hey! What did you think?

557
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,090
Well.

558
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,780
Oh come on you'll love it! It'll be great!

559
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,090
All the shouting about?

560
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,400
[Mike] Also sure I heard gun shots and animals dying.

561
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,510
Tammy um, this is Lynn. Lynn this is Tammy.

562
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,330
Tammy Lynn Lynn. Tammy.

563
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,660
[Bill] Wait who am I?

564
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,830
[Kevin] You're Lynn.

565
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,240
[Bill] No no. I'm Tammy, you're Lynn.

566
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,550
[Kevin] So then, who's Lynn?

567
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,120
[Bill] Tammy is Lynn. But that's you!

568
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,690
[Kevin] So I'm Lynn right Tammy?

569
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,910
[Bill] I don't know.

570
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,410
Cheapest place in town.

571
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,570
Best company in the world.

572
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,100
Lots of party room!

573
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,700
[Mike] And we need a lot of party room as we are college students

574
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,220
and definitely not 30 year old bank tellers.

575
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,730
Plenty of privacy if you happen to have a FRIEND.

576
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,670
MM hmm. (laughs)

577
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,580
See all you have to do is say yes?

578
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,330
YES! Don't rush her!

579
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,540
[Kevin] The director's main note was "no one, at any time,

580
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,730
should act like a real human being."

581
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:19,540
She may have other plans or something.

582
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,430
[Bill] Or maybe there's just not enough party space

583
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:24,590
her being such a crazy college student. And all?

584
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,490
Where's the phone?

585
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:27,930
Uh.

586
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:30,040
Well. One little item this house never had.

587
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,920
[Mike] No phone. But there is that pervasive fart smell.

588
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,060
[Bill] Huh?

589
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,940
Electricity?  Tammy we have electricity.

590
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,070
Okay. Not even he'd like things that simple.

591
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,170
Come on. I'll show you where the nearest phone is.

592
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,410
What was that?

593
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,240
Hello David. How are you?

594
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,080
Just fine thank you.

595
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,350
I knew you'd be here today.

596
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,020
And I just wanted to come by and thank you

597
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,720
for telling your friends about the house.

598
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,240
Four of them moved in already,

599
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,070
and another tenant coming in this afternoon.

600
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:57,780
[Bill] Also I just took a class on how to speak in the most boring manner possible.

601
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,110
How do you think I'm doing?

602
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,840
Really interested in the story.

603
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,440
Sure come by anytime.

604
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,790
Good.

605
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,960
I think I left my note book in the court room. Will you excuse me?

606
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,500
Okay.

607
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,430
[Mike] Okaya! It's the new duller way of saying OKAY. (Kevin laughs)

608
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:15,100
Mr. Girard what are you doing here?

609
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,530
Hi Miss Dalton.

610
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,090
I'm here three or four times a month.

611
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,680
[Kevin] Well that explains what you're DOING here then!

612
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,540
Yes we just tried a fellow I arrested last month for shooting fish.

613
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,390
Shooting fish?

614
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,770
[Bill] Yeah Lou Zeland is an angry drunk.

615
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,720
What can I tell you?

616
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,300
The story about the fish making so much noise he couldn't sleep.

617
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,990
That's ridiculous!

618
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,210
[Mike] It's not nearly as ridiculous as you fawning

619
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,950
over the aged whip carrying park ranger!

620
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,780
Speaking of stories.

621
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,840
I was just talking to David Cody and I was thinking

622
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,340
about going out to the house to do a follow up.

623
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,850
[Bill] I told him that already, and it was such riveting cinema,

624
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,880
I thought I'd thrill the audience by saying it again.

625
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,970
Might be something interesting.

626
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,440
Okay.

627
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,330
Right around here.

628
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,090
That's the old man!

629
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,530
Those WERE noisy fish!

630
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,930
[Kevin] The dark power.

631
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:08,480
Come for the lengthy dog whipping scenes, stay for the humor.

632
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,440
You know it's too bad you didn't come by here when you first started your story.

633
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,800
I've been keeping up on the Cody place since I started working here.

634
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,040
[Mike] I keep asking for one, maybe two more 20 watt bulbs.

635
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,880
But they won't give in.

636
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,720
I'm a history/mathematics major.

637
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,430
So I'm kind of interested in things such as Totem Hill and  local legends.

638
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,460
Well you know.  This is interesting.

639
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,890
But it doesn't really tell me anything I don't know.

640
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:34,440
[Bill] That's what I say every time I'm done watching The Electric Company.

641
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,250
Find some interesting information.  Take a look at this.

642
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,750
What is it?

643
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,330
It was filed away with some government documents.

644
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,630
We got a whole file cabinet back there full of things pertaining to

645
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:44,590
federal investigations concerning this county area.

646
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,130
[Kevin] So if you ever need anything that's interesting

647
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,960
but doesn't tell you anything you don't already know. I'm your man.

648
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,650
See after he proved, that the treaties were still enforceable.

649
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:55,690
You mean after the federal courts ruled in his favor.

650
00:29:55,690 --> 00:30:00,370
[Mike] (slurs words) In his favor! (Bill laughs)

651
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,110
This is news.

652
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,210
[Bill] (slurs words) What was it?

653
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:08,260
[Mike] (slurs words) Yeah what was it? You're talking about?

654
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,480
He made a formal written request that the land be destroyed.

655
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,840
Uprooted, graded and that if any archeological

656
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,810
artifacts were found, they were to be turned over to the US Navy and buried at sea.

657
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,900
[Bill] He also shot a lot of fish because they were too noisy.

658
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,210
Kind of a thing we do around here.

659
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,900
Found that four Toltec sorcerers had buried themselves there several.

660
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,110
[Kevin] (gruff voice) I was in the navy and I retired. (Bill laughs)

661
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:33,610
Why did he want everything dumped in the ocean?

662
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:36,920
The Toltecs believed that if they buried themselves alive.

663
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,260
Buried alive?

664
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:42,900
[Mike] I ought to do a follow up story on burying people alive.

665
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,630
They hushed it up to try to keep from being embarrassed.

666
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,330
Anyway, about the legend.

667
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:51,330
These buried sorcerers fed on the blood of the living in order to remain alive.

668
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:53,580
[Bill] Yep. That's what Madonna does too.

669
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:57,830
Practiced all those dusk to dawn rituals to keep the Toltec sorcerers under control.

670
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,540
That explains it all.

671
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,440
[Kevin] (laughs) It does???!!! (Mike laughs)

672
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,550
Built on Totem Hill.

673
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:10,010
Cody went before the courts to get control of the property surrounding it.

674
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:12,660
[Mike] (gruff voice) Gin and bourbon for everyone!

675
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:17,060
Reimbursed the contractor and gave the house the house to Cody.

676
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,730
Of course the contractors were glad to get rid of the place.

677
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,530
Three of their workmen were listed as missing.

678
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,160
during the construction of the home.

679
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,340
[Bill] May have something to do with that fart smell!

680
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,570
Yes he thought that the Toltec sorcerers got them.

681
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:31,030
So my quiet unassuming friend, John Cody,

682
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,040
went before the government of the United States.

683
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,510
And demanded that they let him have control.

684
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:40,260
[Kevin] (slurred words) Okay I'm gonna grab a nap. UGH.

685
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,340
Wouldn't have asked for it if he hadn't thought he

686
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,850
was protecting the people that were laughing at him.

687
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,940
What a self sacrificing man he was.

688
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,420
[Mike] I declare this scene over. Good bye.

689
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:57,490
(birds chirping)

690
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,610
[Bill] Ooo! I hope the party's not too big a rager!

864
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,970
We're not exactly speaking.

865
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,980
Tell you what, that bitch had better shape up.

866
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,450
Or I'm gonna teach her tail a lesson.

867
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:59,500
[Mike] Is her tail familiar with Howard's End's

868
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,450
of people's history of the United States?

869
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:03,300
Wait a minute.  Dallas and Al are in school this year aren't they?

870
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,100
Yeah I wish they weren't. I can't stand them.

871
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,200
Okay okay. I'll give you a ride.

872
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,780
And I think I'll drop it on those two.

873
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,580
We might just have a little party here this evening.

874
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,250
Now Craig!

875
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,960
Put Susan's lovely butt in order.

876
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,220
[Kevin] Dallas is a fully licensed and bonded butt repair specialist.

877
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,810
Alan? UGH!

878
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,450
Oh get out of here and let me get ready will ya?

879
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:23,640
Bitch.

880
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:29,970
[Bill] Punched up dialog by Brett Easton Ellis.

881
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:33,550
He wasn't home.  (Mike laughs)

882
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,490
Left a message with the service.

883
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,130
Uh that's too bad.

884
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:39,140
[Mike] I simonized my hair for this and everything.

885
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,510
Oh I'm sure he would.

886
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,350
He'd be glued to his TV set.

887
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:45,720
You know I bet he misses Cody.

888
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,800
Yeah. You can see it in his eyes.

889
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,610
[Kevin] No actually that's jaundice.

890
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,230
He has these really sensitive eyes.

891
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:54,480
Well I don't know about sensitive eyes.

892
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,570
But I do know that Cody is part of a world gone by.

893
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:58,450
And Girard misses him.

894
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:01,800
[Bill] So are we gonna Mary Kay Letourneau or what?

895
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,350
You don't think that Mr. Girard believes in Cody's legends do you?

896
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:09,030
No. But I do realize that there is some truth. In all legends.

897
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:11,280
[Mike] Especially the legend of Curly's Gold!

898
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,050
[Bill] So much truth.

899
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:18,520
And the fact is, according to fiction anyway, that

900
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,530
tonight's the night four eagle's dreaded most.

901
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:25,290
[Kevin] The friars are roasting him tonight.

902
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:33,410
(music indistinct in background)

903
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:36,560
[Bill] Gamergates founding fathers.

904
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,630
Hey man! Check it out!

905
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,890
[Mike] Composting toilets half off!

906
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:42,740
[Kevin] Whoo!

907
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:48,130
(indistinct)

908
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,550
Hey boss we got a hot balloon getting out of a truck out here.

909
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,170
What?

910
00:41:53,170 --> 00:42:00,080
[Kevin] Ah thank god. I was hoping we'd get another helping of this guy.

911
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,130
I want to drive your truck Uncle Earl.

912
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:04,910
[Bill] I want to run over those nice dogs from the

913
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:07,130
beginning of the movie Uncle Earl!

914
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:11,190
This job I'll never know. (fart noise)

915
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,050
Sick Uncle Earl!

916
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:17,160
[Mike] Hard to believe this guy is Frederick Eisman professor of poetry at Yale.

917
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:21,870
Worry anybody half to death.

918
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,260
Hey man! You're right!

919
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,820
The GoodYear blimp is at the door!

920
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:28,250
[Kevin] It's gonna provide aerial coverage of our sad little party!

921
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:32,070
(music plays)

922
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:36,820
Hey sorry dude, but party's by invitation only.

923
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:41,030
My name's not dude.

924
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:43,260
Here to fix the toilet.

925
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:47,180
[Bill] After I thoroughly wrecked that porcelain son of a bitch that is.

926
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,380
Hey Craig! You'd better tell your friend to bring his own beer.

927
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,730
No problem. Looks like he's carrying his own keg.

928
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,490
[Mike] Let's tap him and imbibe his bodily essences.

929
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,230
Just a couple of my friends come by to entertain the girls.

930
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:59,520
Entertain? Shit.

931
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,220
Hey like fix it good okay?

932
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,990
What do you think I'm gonna do? Fix it bad?

933
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:07,370
[Kevin] Well there's a 90% chance that  Earl will, in fact, fix it bad.

934
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:09,470
How did you come to be staying here?

935
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:11,970
Sammy thought these girls were supposed to bring other girls up here.

936
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:14,860
Well I kind of slipped in through a loop hole.

937
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,940
[Bill] The "we need another victim whose grisly death

938
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:20,100
we can all celebrate" loop hole.

939
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,070
She's the one who called.

940
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:26,090
She said "you got to get over and fix this toilet right now!"

941
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:27,960
[Mike] His sister's Polly Holiday?

942
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,630
If those girls wouldn't be flushing their UNsanitary

943
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:32,220
napkins down the commode, wouldn't get stopped up anyway.

944
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,560
[Bill] Oh charming.

945
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:37,100
Your head's the only unsanitary thing that was clogging up the commode.

946
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,810
[Kevin] Wait. His head is clogging up the toilet?

947
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:41,150
And if so where did he get his CURRENT head?

948
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:46,030
(indistinct)

949
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:48,620
[Bill] Heh heh. And let THAT be a lesson to

950
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:51,660
anyone who dares cross wits with Earl Coleman.

951
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,780
Listen I was sorry to hear about your brother being sick.

952
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,110
Well not as sorry as I am.

953
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:00,000
He forgets that too much fun to fixing toilets.

954
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,600
[Mike] Sorry to rub your life choices and your

955
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,990
stupid should have gone to college face!

956
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:06,260
Proud to entertains such a handsome little guy!

957
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,210
Heh, entertain.

958
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:11,090
Understand these two guys in here want to entertain you.

959
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:13,280
[Kevin] They're rehearsing Cabaret in there right now.

960
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,010
Had music for an hour.

961
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:16,790
Mm hmm. Yelling or peering every five minutes.

962
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:20,250
See what they're really trying to do is intimidate Susan and me.

963
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:21,690
Well why just you two?

964
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:23,530
My color for one.

965
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:26,800
[Bill] My collection of Ace of Base records for two.

966
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,430
Kind of feel left out don't you?

967
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:29,970
Not really. Well I tell you one thing.

968
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:34,030
They come banging on my door and I'll stick all three of their heads in there.

969
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:39,000
[Mike] Susan's really stuck in a rut with a toilet thing. It's time to branch out sister.

970
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,910
Don't worry about those guys.

971
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:42,450
I'll get rid of them before I leave.

972
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,970
And the Indian, I'll talk to him tomorrow about what's his face.

973
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:48,510
[Kevin] You're our knight in shining armor repulsive homophobe.

974
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,030
Come on squirt.

975
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:53,090
I want to drive the truck!

976
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,880
Will you shut up about the truck?

977
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,870
You're only nine years old.

978
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:59,890
Nine year old is too stupid to drive a truck.

979
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:02,970
[Bill] Remember when this was a movie about ancient Toltec wizards?

980
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:05,030
I got a lot of studying to do.

981
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:07,170
Me too.

982
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:09,900
But how can you with all this noise?

983
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:13,540
[Mike] And that was Wes Craven's The Facts of Life.

984
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:15,450
Hey Susan baby!

985
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:17,410
How about coming in here and modeling one of your little outfits for us?

986
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:18,900
You did what you wanted to do with his face.

987
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,880
Come on in and let us do what we want to do with yours!

988
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,090
[Kevin] Wait. I could have said that with more better grammar. Let me try again!

989
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:25,940
Lay off that girl.

990
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:27,890
Why? you like her, man?

991
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:31,350
Come on let's think of some good watermelon jokes for mammy Tammy.

992
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:32,730
Yeah.

993
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,920
[Bill] It's racist Scattergories. Fun for the whole clan.

994
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,870
Damn! Ain't a thing wrong with this commode.

995
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:44,790
I don't understand why nobody can't fix nothing no more.

996
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:48,950
[Mike] Especially stuff that's not broken as I just said this toilet isn't.

997
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:50,820
One of these days you're gonna go to college.

998
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:54,220
You'll study real hard.

999
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:58,070
[Kevin] That kid? HE'S why there's a warning on packs of silica gel.

1000
00:45:58,070 --> 00:45:59,930
Educated and everything.

1001
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:03,510
And be embarrassed about how dumb your Uncle Earl is.

1002
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:10,517
[Bill] Look son, he's trying to tell you he's stuck behind the toilet!

1003
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,310
[Mike] Alright, just push aside all these Dinty Moore cans.

1004
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:18,300
That's just fine.

1005
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,140
But I'll tell you one thing.

1006
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:23,400
If I ever catch you acting like one of them scrotum heads

1007
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,800
down the hall I'll beat your buns with a weed eater.

1008
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,690
[Kevin] Somewhere Adrian Peterson nods his approval.

1009
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:35,740
Cletis? Cletis? Cletis? (engine starts)

1010
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:39,050
Stop!

1011
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:41,700
[Bill] Stop! In the name of COPD!

1012
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,870
That kid went to pick us a six pack.

1013
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:46,300
Hope you don't mind. Hot damn white trash.

1014
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:50,110
[Mike] The pot and kettle quietly tender their resignations.

1015
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:52,000
Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn!

1016
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,120
Sounds like a stampede outside.

1017
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,260
Just like his damn daddy!

1018
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:01,820
[Kevin] Truck thief nine years old, wears his hat that dumb way, just like his daddy.

1019
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:06,890
Ah where the hell is my tool?

1020
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:10,830
[Bill] This guy hasn't seen his tool in YEARS!

1021
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:15,260
(music plays)

1022
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:19,140
[Mike] Back off. I'm busy not smoking this cigarette.

1023
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:23,360
What's that damn thing?

1024
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,800
[Bill] Carrie needs a manicure!

1025
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,740
(laughing)

1026
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:31,120
Drink up guys! The party's just beginning!

1027
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:35,070
(laughing)

1028
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:38,870
That's about it. You know I really hate this machine Mr. Girard.

1029
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:42,580
[Kevin] As a television reporter I naturally hate all recording devices.

1030
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:44,700
Thanks again.

1031
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,890
I almost forgot, to tell you the reason I'm doing the story tonight.

1032
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:51,030
We figured out today's the start of the evil day.
