This is a motherfucking staring contest.

00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:50,583
You can't be serious.

359
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,833
Look at my face. I'm really serious.

360
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:55,791
Fine.

361
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:58,000
I'm very competitive.

362
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,083
Me too.

363
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,083
I'm staying over at Tina's tonight.

364
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,291
OK.

365
00:27:50,958 --> 00:27:51,958
"OK"?

366
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:54,208
Yeah.

367
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,125
Usually, that incites a diatribe

368
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:00,708
- about how Tina's an asshole...
- "Diatribe." Good word.

369
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:02,833
...and how I shouldn't spend
so much time with her.

370
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,083
Yeah, well, it appears that
my many rantings on this topic

She hated reading.

No, he's not.

443
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:22,541
He freaked out last year
and threw a chair at Roamer,

444
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:24,375

445
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:26,666
He did?

446
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:31,416
[Amanda] Yeah, like, Roamer was fine,
but he's seriously fucked up.

00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:55,458

468
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,375
I get it.

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,333
Doesn't mean
it doesn't piss me off sometimes.

470

475
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:25,625
you could put it right over there.

476

Sorry. Hey. Hi, I'm Theodore Finch.
Pleasure to meet you both.

- Little early, don't you think, Theodore?
- Yes. Yes, it is early.

536

That is a fair observation.

537
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:58,916
But you see, I'm your daughter's partner
for the school project,

538

[Finch] Yes, sir. We're partners.

Well, Theodore, I think
it's Violet's decision to make, but...

00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:26,583
maybe not a bad idea.

01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:41,000
Um... I am ADHD, OCD,
BPD, DID, and bipolar.

884
01:15:41,541 --> 01:15:42,541
Yeah. [chuckles]

885
01:15:42,833 --> 01:15:46,458
Um... you'd think some of those
would cancel the others out, but...

886
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:48,666
Yeah, my week's been OK.

887
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:50,916
I've been watching
a lot of basketball lately,

888
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,291
and that's been helping a lot, so...

889
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Good.

890
01:15:56,458 --> 01:15:57,916
Hi. Welcome.

891
01:16:01,875 --> 01:16:02,875
Um...

892
01:16:05,041 --> 01:16:07,666
I'm, uh... Theodore Finch.

893
01:16:09,791 --> 01:16:10,833
No labels.

894
01:16:12,583 --> 01:16:16,125
Not really sure why I'm here.
[chuckles lightly]

895
01:16:17,166 --> 01:16:18,166
Uh...

896
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:25,041
I guess it's 'cause I...
I got in this fight at school and,

897
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:27,541
like,

898
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:31,541
I was there, but I wasn't there.

899
01:16:31,625 --> 01:16:33,625
I was watchin' myself, and...

900
01:16:37,875 --> 01:16:38,875
uh...

901
01:16:39,458 --> 01:16:41,833
I-I-I just get a little lost sometimes.

902
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,333
I run... a lot.

903
01:16:48,041 --> 01:16:49,458
Sometimes that helps.

904
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Kind of.

905
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:57,708
I don't know. Is that enough?

906
01:16:58,666 --> 01:16:59,666
Sure.

907
01:17:00,125 --> 01:17:01,750
Thanks. Glad you're here.

908
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:07,833
Amanda, why don't you go ahead?

909
01:17:10,166 --> 01:17:11,250
I'm Amanda.

910
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:14,791
I'm bulimic.

911
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:18,125
I've tried to kill myself twice.

912
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:23,291
I think about it almost every day.

913
01:17:37,166 --> 01:17:38,875
[footsteps approaching]

914
01:17:39,416 --> 01:17:41,416
[Kate] Hey, have you heard anything yet?

915
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:44,333
- No.
- [Kate sighs] OK.

916
01:17:45,458 --> 01:17:48,416
I gotta go to work. I'm gonna be late.
But you should stay.

917
01:17:49,333 --> 01:17:50,750
Why does he keep doing this?

918
01:17:54,625 --> 01:17:55,708
I don't know.

919
01:18:00,041 --> 01:18:02,250
Have him call me
when you hear from him, OK?

920
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:05,041
Yeah.

921
01:18:05,291 --> 01:18:06,583
- [Kate] Bye.
- Bye.

922
01:18:06,708 --> 01:18:08,708
[footsteps receding]

923
01:18:12,208 --> 01:18:14,291
[Amanda]
<i>I heard you beat the shit outta Roamer.</i>

924
01:18:16,583 --> 01:18:18,103
Why do you keep doing stuff like that?

925
01:18:18,166 --> 01:18:20,541
Aren't you tired of people
talking about you all the time?

926
01:18:22,166 --> 01:18:23,916
People are always gonna talk.

927
01:18:24,916 --> 01:18:26,166
It's their specialty.

928
01:18:29,583 --> 01:18:30,583
Are you OK?

929
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:37,666
I don't know.
I feel like I keep messing things up,

930
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:42,166
and I'm not sure
I know how to not do that.

931
01:18:42,625 --> 01:18:43,625
Does this work?

932
01:18:45,666 --> 01:18:47,458
It's better than the alternative.

933
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,000
[knocking on door]

934
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:37,293
[Kate] <i>Your girlfriend's pretty worried
about you.</i>

935
01:19:37,708 --> 01:19:39,625
She's been at the house all afternoon.

936
01:19:43,041 --> 01:19:44,041
What's going on?

937
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:52,166
I don't... really remember...

938
01:19:53,125 --> 01:19:55,250
Dad that well.

939
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:58,708
And everything I do...

940
01:20:01,041 --> 01:20:03,458
remember is... is bad.

941
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:08,375
Are there any...

942
01:20:09,583 --> 01:20:11,750
good memories you have of him?

943
01:20:12,791 --> 01:20:13,833
[Kate sighs]

944
01:20:14,833 --> 01:20:17,916
Well, the fact that he would
beat the shit out of us

945
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,833
kind of negated all the good times.

946
01:20:26,916 --> 01:20:29,500
But why was he like that?

947
01:20:29,583 --> 01:20:32,333
Was he like that because of us? Was he...

948
01:20:33,583 --> 01:20:34,875
like that because of Mom?

949
01:20:34,958 --> 01:20:37,375
He was like that
because he was a shitty person.

950
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:39,833
[Finch] There has to be a reason, though.

951
01:20:39,916 --> 01:20:43,000
Because if there's a reason,
then he could get better.

952
01:20:43,083 --> 01:20:44,166
Something or...

953
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:48,416
someone could make him better, right?

954
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:51,875
I don't know. Who cares?
Dude, he's someone else's problem.

955
01:20:51,958 --> 01:20:54,000
Why are you asking me about Dad?

956
01:20:57,875 --> 01:20:59,291
What's going on, Finch?

957
01:21:03,541 --> 01:21:05,458
Come on. You can talk to me, man.

958
01:21:08,333 --> 01:21:10,125
Nothing, Kate.

959
01:21:10,208 --> 01:21:11,291
Sorry. Nothing.

960
01:21:12,666 --> 01:21:13,666
I'm good.

961
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:16,916
Are you sure?
Because I have to open the bar,

962
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,750
- but I can find someone to cover me.
- I'm good. [chuckles]

963
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:26,500
You know I love you, right, Theo?

964
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:30,750
I know.

965
01:21:47,208 --> 01:21:48,208
[door opens]

966
01:21:52,958 --> 01:21:54,416
[footsteps approaching]

967
01:22:13,791 --> 01:22:14,875
You scared me.

968
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:22,916
What is all of this?

969
01:22:25,583 --> 01:22:27,250
[Finch] I'm trying to focus.

970
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:29,583
[Violet] Focus on what?

971
01:22:30,916 --> 01:22:32,291
On staying awake.

972
01:22:34,916 --> 01:22:37,000
I don't understand what that means.

973
01:22:38,708 --> 01:22:40,166
Sometimes I...

974
01:22:41,125 --> 01:22:42,333
go blank.

975
01:22:44,166 --> 01:22:46,875
I... get into these dark moods.

976
01:22:48,041 --> 01:22:50,666
I think too fast
to keep track of anything,

977
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:53,041
and then it's like...

978
01:22:54,208 --> 01:22:57,041
all my thoughts are gone at once.

979
01:22:58,458 --> 01:23:01,791
And sometimes,
if I put 'em up there, I can...

980
01:23:02,208 --> 01:23:04,333
focus and slow down, but...

981
01:23:07,291 --> 01:23:09,791
I can't right now. I can't.

982
01:23:11,958 --> 01:23:12,958
OK.

983
01:23:14,125 --> 01:23:15,916
[Finch] And this usually works.

984
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,791
Maybe there's too much clutter.

985
01:23:21,333 --> 01:23:23,708
I can fix it. I just...

986
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:27,000
I just need time to figure this out.

987
01:23:30,291 --> 01:23:33,291
- [Violet] I'm trying to help you.
- I don't need your help!

988
01:23:33,833 --> 01:23:36,541
This is on me! This isn't about you!

989
01:23:38,833 --> 01:23:40,708
You need to tell me what's wrong.

990
01:23:44,375 --> 01:23:45,458
You don't get it.

991
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:49,583
[sobbing]

992
01:23:51,583 --> 01:23:52,666
You're right.

993
01:23:53,833 --> 01:23:55,083
I don't get it.

994
01:23:58,416 --> 01:24:00,041
Don't you know, Violet?

995
01:24:03,666 --> 01:24:04,875
I'm "The Freak."

996
01:24:08,916 --> 01:24:10,291
I'm fucked up!

997
01:24:22,875 --> 01:24:24,000
I need you to leave.

998
01:24:29,916 --> 01:24:30,916
Go!

999
01:24:33,875 --> 01:24:35,375
[footsteps receding]

1000
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:40,958
[door opens]

1001
01:24:42,041 --> 01:24:43,041
[door closes]

1002
01:25:00,375 --> 01:25:01,750
[birds chirping]

1003
01:25:07,208 --> 01:25:09,208
[indistinct chattering]

1004
01:25:23,791 --> 01:25:25,250
[brakes squeak]

1005
01:25:35,125 --> 01:25:37,125
[ringing tone]

1006
01:25:39,458 --> 01:25:41,708
[voicemail]
<i>Hey, it's Finch. Leave a message.</i>

1007
01:25:41,791 --> 01:25:43,583
- [Violet sobbing]
- [voicemail beeps]

1008
01:25:43,666 --> 01:25:45,375
Hey, Finch. Um... [sobs]

1009
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:49,250
I'm sorry.

1010
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:51,833
I'm just sorry that I pushed.

1011
01:25:51,916 --> 01:25:53,666
And... I...

1012
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:56,666
just need you to come back.

1013
01:26:00,958 --> 01:26:03,500
I just really need you to come back, OK?

1014
01:26:09,708 --> 01:26:11,708
[breathing heavily]

1015
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:31,916
Hey, kiddo.

1016
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:33,750
Hey.

1017
01:26:39,875 --> 01:26:40,875
Dad?

1018
01:26:43,333 --> 01:26:44,333
Yeah?

1019
01:26:48,041 --> 01:26:49,500
On Eleanor's birthday...

1020
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:54,958
I...

1021
01:26:57,833 --> 01:26:59,250
I wasn't really thinking.

1022
01:27:04,791 --> 01:27:06,708
I found myself at the bridge.

1023
01:27:10,666 --> 01:27:12,416
I was standing on a ledge.

1024
01:27:16,875 --> 01:27:18,583
That's how I met Finch.

1025
01:27:19,666 --> 01:27:20,958
He found me there.

1026
01:27:25,666 --> 01:27:26,875
He saved me.

1027
01:27:29,916 --> 01:27:31,208
You... you weren't gonna...

1028
01:27:31,666 --> 01:27:32,666
I'm OK.

1029
01:27:35,958 --> 01:27:36,958
I was...

1030
01:27:38,166 --> 01:27:39,166
confused.

1031
01:27:41,458 --> 01:27:42,541
I was sad.

1032
01:27:45,458 --> 01:27:46,458
I'm OK.

1033
01:27:50,333 --> 01:27:51,458
I'm better now.

1034
01:27:54,916 --> 01:27:55,916
Wow.

1035
01:27:57,958 --> 01:28:00,000
Well, I'm glad Finch was there.

1036
01:28:02,875 --> 01:28:03,875
Me too.

1037
01:28:09,625 --> 01:28:11,750
[Violet] I just wish I knew where he was.

1038
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:15,750
Well...

1039
01:28:18,583 --> 01:28:20,708
you two have been a lot of places.

1040
01:28:21,833 --> 01:28:23,875
Is there any place else he might go?

1041
01:28:42,375 --> 01:28:43,500
[buckles seat belt]

1042
01:28:44,541 --> 01:28:45,625
[exhales slowly]

1043

[breathing shakily]

1046
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:49,500
[panicked breathing]

1047
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:55,666
Finch!

1048
01:29:56,041 --> 01:29:57,708
[panicked breathing]

1049
01:30:00,958 --> 01:30:02,000
Finch!

1050
01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:06,666
Finch.

1051
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:08,083
[panicked breathing]

1052
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:24,125
[Violet sobbing]

1053
01:30:34,458 --> 01:30:36,416
Marco!

[somber instrumental music playing]

[strained sobbing]

1056
01:31:54,583 --> 01:31:56,541
[man] On behalf of Finch's family,

1057
01:31:56,625 --> 01:31:59,000
I wanna thank you all
for being here today.

1058
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:03,750
We've gathered to celebrate
and to honor the memory of one

1059
01:32:03,833 --> 01:32:07,875
who will be incredibly missed
because he has been so dearly loved.

1060
01:32:08,625 --> 01:32:10,541
The events of these past few days...

1061
01:32:10,708 --> 01:32:12,708
[mournful instrumental music playing]

1062
01:32:37,333 --> 01:32:39,333
[indistinct reading]

1063
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,250
