1
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,433
You know, I was watching you.
You know, I was watching you.

2
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,200
You are he king, my friend.
I'm talking the king.

3
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:56,596
The boss is gonna bronze your balls.

4
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:58,677
That feels good, suppose.

5
00:00:58,721 --> 00:01:00,631
I mean it was absolutely awesome.

6
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,639
You got Ornay and Delecom in your
pocket.

7
00:01:40,603 --> 00:01:42,116
Think we'll be need the car?

8
00:01:42,683 --> 00:01:43,913
Try to wait here.

9
00:01:59,243 --> 00:02:02,600
Mr. Byron, we can still catch
Mr. Kimball in his car.

10
00:02:02,805 --> 00:02:05,194
- Shall I phone?
- Thank you, Helene.

11
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:19,914
Mr. Kimball on 3, Mr. Byron.

12
00:02:25,925 --> 00:02:28,917
- Hello, Roger.
- Good work, Jeffrey, you've sold Ornay.

13
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,959
Well, let's hope so. We'll know
the 30th. I'm having dinner with him.

14
00:02:32,164 --> 00:02:36,000
- I have complete confidence in you.
- Thank you, have a good trip.

15
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:43,122
- Bring in the Delecom briefs, Helene.
- Bronze, jell. Platinum!

16
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:51,635
- Thank you, Helene.
- You're welcome.

17
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:58,801
- Has my wife phoned?
- No, sir. She has not.

18
00:02:59,688 --> 00:03:02,521
- Could you fix me a Scotch?
- "Yes, of course."

19
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:28,839
- You look very nice today.
- Thank you, Mr. Byron.

20
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,401
That suit is very becoming.

21
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:41,400
"You are very nice."

22
00:04:37,372 --> 00:04:40,286
I can feel Jeffrey leaving me.

23
00:04:40,494 --> 00:04:45,123
- No, he'd never divorce you.
- Leave me in other ways.

24
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:49,409
- It's you, sweetie.
- Think so?

25
00:04:49,614 --> 00:04:53,128
- Lf you were someone else...
- That reminds me.

26
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,325
Do you know of a good handy-man?

27
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:58,207
We need someone to finish up all
the work around the apartment.

28
00:04:59,014 --> 00:05:02,087
I don't want to call that contractor
back.

29
00:05:03,015 --> 00:05:06,893
- I think he cheated me.
- My mother is using one right now.

30
00:05:07,094 --> 00:05:10,327
- Is he bonded?
- Well, he's older so...

31
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:12,525
- Yeah.
- Yeah, probably.

32
00:05:27,815 --> 00:05:31,967
I'll buy it.
I'm ovulating.

33
00:05:37,896 --> 00:05:41,207
- I got you a new cigar, Lucky.
- Thanks, Gloria.

34
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:44,409
- Will you slip it in the tool box?
- Sure.

35
00:05:44,617 --> 00:05:47,335
I'm used to women in lounge clothes.

36
00:05:47,537 --> 00:05:50,413
My wife has more bathrobes than
Miss America.

37
00:05:54,017 --> 00:05:58,930
One thing about your work, you don't
have to wear a tie or anything like that.

38
00:06:01,818 --> 00:06:05,207
Big ties just advertise a man's bad
taste.

39
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,008
What about women's clothes.
What do they say?

40
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:16,854
How a lady shows her breasts in public
tells me all I need to know about her.

41
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:22,934
You take plumbing and a woman's
nature.

42
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:26,416
They're both unpredictable and
filled with hidden mysteries.

43
00:06:30,817 --> 00:06:33,014
All a man can do is service them
properly...

44
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:35,574
...so they flow the way they're
designed to.

45
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:39,654
- Say, Gloria.
- Yeah?

46
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:42,216
- Come over here.
- Over there?

47
00:06:42,421 --> 00:06:43,409
Yeah.

48
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,291
- I want you to turn me on.
- What?

49
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,334
- Hot water, when I say so.
- Oh!

50
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,532
Okay. Make it wet.

51
00:07:05,701 --> 00:07:07,453
It works.

52
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:15,172
Just have to caress each curve
properly.

53
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:40,619
Well, cousin Constance, surely you
cannot suppose there is any malice...

54
00:07:40,822 --> 00:07:43,973
...within these walls.

55
00:07:48,823 --> 00:07:52,214
I'm not living here.
You cannot force me.

56
00:08:12,505 --> 00:08:15,622
- Now you know, Constance...
- Hey, babe.

57
00:08:15,824 --> 00:08:20,615
Now you have been in ecstasy. There's
evil behind every stone in this place.

58
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:23,463
- Odd smell.
- New brand.

59
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,858
- I bet.
- There is no evil in this house, cousin.

60
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:30,215
- "Only in you."
- What are you watching?

61
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:36,223
Jack Dana.
Taped it off the late show.

62
00:08:36,425 --> 00:08:39,419
He was much too worthy.
A living thing.

63
00:08:40,627 --> 00:08:42,695
Ain't heard his name in a while.

64
00:08:44,906 --> 00:08:49,775
- How many pictures did you do with him?
- One bad one, one lousy one...

65
00:08:49,986 --> 00:08:54,459
...one even more lousy one,
two really lousy ones.

66
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,180
Five.

67
00:08:58,828 --> 00:09:02,024
If you only knew of the agonies
I'm sparing you.

68
00:09:02,227 --> 00:09:06,300
- He ain't much of an actor.
- Ain't is the wrong word.

69
00:09:07,227 --> 00:09:08,215
Darling.

70
00:09:08,747 --> 00:09:10,977
But you're right,
he wasn't much of an actor.

71
00:09:13,228 --> 00:09:15,218
- He died today.
- We are, you and I are fierce...

72
00:09:15,267 --> 00:09:16,255
...in fine clothes.

73
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,618
- He what?
- The slightest touch...

74
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:20,865
- What from?
...and we may shatter.

75
00:09:21,068 --> 00:09:23,060
He was allergic to himself.

76
00:09:29,387 --> 00:09:33,143
Well, here...

77
00:09:36,669 --> 00:09:41,345
Give me those feet.
Let's take a look here.

78
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,309
Look, that toe is much bigger
than that toe.

79
00:09:49,428 --> 00:09:51,944
He died a long time ago,
if you ask me.

80
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,059
Just gave up after losing you.

81
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,868
That's what I'd do, babe.

82
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,903
How about fixing the mirror first?

83
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:16,742
So...?

84
00:10:18,032 --> 00:10:22,262
How was work today, Lucky.
Unclog a few tubes?

85
00:10:24,032 --> 00:10:28,981
- Pipes.
- Big difference, I'm sure.

86
00:10:30,032 --> 00:10:32,593
You're taking me with you into town
tomorrow.

87
00:10:32,794 --> 00:10:35,306
I don't have anything scheduled in
town tomorrow, babe.

88
00:10:35,512 --> 00:10:41,668
- I do. Doctor's appointment at 9.
- Doctor? Something wrong?

89
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:47,026
My soul needs and overhaul.

90
00:10:48,913 --> 00:10:53,464
You got at least another 2 or 3 hundred
years left on that model.

91
00:10:54,512 --> 00:10:58,347
Lucky Fix-it Mann!
Yes, Ma'am.

92
00:11:01,434 --> 00:11:04,712
I worked on that house today
as a matter on fact.

93
00:11:06,035 --> 00:11:11,029
Right. That'd be fine.
Alright. Bye. "Yes".

94
00:11:11,795 --> 00:11:13,831
How's that for a coincidence?

95
00:11:14,036 --> 00:11:17,027
Job estimate in town tomorrow morning
at 9.

96
00:11:17,235 --> 00:11:19,510
That's why they call you Lucky.

97
00:11:49,437 --> 00:11:51,553
Goddamn lock!

98
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:57,910
Marianne, have you found somebody
to fix...

99
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,468
- Do you like it?
- Excuse me, I have to change...

100
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,509
...into a jock strap.

101
00:12:24,438 --> 00:12:27,474
Jeffrey, aren't you going to say
anything?

102
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,228
The music's awful.

103
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:53,594
I thought you were finding a handy-man?
What happened?

104
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,713
He's coming tomorrow. Isabel's mother
recommended him.

105
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,038
- She's probably screwing him.
- Jeffrey!

106
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,956
Admit it, Marianne. All Gloria knows
how to do well is screw.

107
00:13:04,161 --> 00:13:08,313
Some women are like that.
Others aren't.

108
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:14,951
- How do you know?
- How do I know what?

109
00:13:16,243 --> 00:13:19,552
How do you know that all Gloria
can do well is screw?

110
00:13:20,722 --> 00:13:25,477
- She told me. What's for dinner?
- When did she tell you?

111
00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:28,472
Last year at Isabel's Christmas party.

112
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,673
Another reason I hate parties.

113
00:13:34,843 --> 00:13:39,233
- Did that excite you?
- Not as much as it should.

114
00:13:41,563 --> 00:13:44,522
I meant when Gloria told you that.

115
00:13:45,363 --> 00:13:48,083
That's what I'm talking about.

116
00:13:51,244 --> 00:13:54,918
Jeffrey, let's make love.

117
00:13:55,844 --> 00:14:00,041
Why don't you relax this role you
think you're playing?

118
00:14:00,243 --> 00:14:03,203
I'm hungry. I'd like to tell you
something about work today.

119
00:14:08,164 --> 00:14:13,077
- Why are these days in red?
- My eggs are fertile.

120
00:14:13,443 --> 00:14:16,801
- What?
- Grade A this week.

121
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:22,205
I'm circling the 30th for a crucial
dinner with Bernard Ornay.

122
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:26,232
Grand poobah of Delecom.
I want you there.

123
00:14:26,725 --> 00:14:29,365
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

124
00:14:32,046 --> 00:14:33,877
It can wait.

125
00:14:35,446 --> 00:14:37,719
Why can't this wait, Marianne?

126
00:14:37,924 --> 00:14:40,439
I'm trying to tell you something
very important.

127
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:45,560
This can't wait. Because I, of course,
have no sense of priority.

128
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:48,122
I want my desires satisfied immediately.

129
00:14:48,328 --> 00:14:51,444
I want to make love with you right
now because you're my husband...

130
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,399
...and I want a baby.

131
00:15:00,047 --> 00:15:03,358
Because... because I love you.

132
00:15:07,808 --> 00:15:12,040
I play this role for myself,
and it makes my cry.

133
00:15:12,247 --> 00:15:15,798
- Maybe I'm the one who should cry.
- Why not?

134
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:18,998
It's all for you anyway.
Nothing's working.

135
00:15:20,448 --> 00:15:22,439
I wouldn't say that.

136
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:26,246
Certain things working quite well
on many levels.

137
00:15:30,648 --> 00:15:32,719
And I love you, too.

138
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:42,326
Want me to stay with you at the
doctor's? I'll cancel this estimate.

139
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,680
- I'll manage, Lucky.
- What's the matter with you?

140
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:48,359
You want something to be matter
with me? I'll try and oblige.

141
00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:52,039
I don't want that. I want to know why
you have to see a doctor.

142
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:55,687
- What's wrong with you?
- You mean, am I dying or something?

143
00:15:55,891 --> 00:15:59,645
Jesus, babe. Don't start. Don't get
into that we're all dying bit.

144
00:15:59,851 --> 00:16:04,241
- Okay. I won't.
- Jack Dana's dead.

145
00:16:04,451 --> 00:16:07,443
You and me, we're still here.
It's a big difference.

146
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:35,132
- Yes?
- Handy-man here, Madame Byron.

147
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,052
"Thank you, Frederico."

148
00:16:53,974 --> 00:16:57,010
- Miss Byron?
- Yes?

149
00:16:57,212 --> 00:17:00,332
- Lucky Fix-it Mann.
- What?

150
00:17:00,535 --> 00:17:02,526
The handy-man.

151
00:17:04,214 --> 00:17:07,605
- How do you do?
- "Pleased to meet you."

152
00:17:10,853 --> 00:17:14,165
- Please, come in, Mr. Mann.
- Thank you. Lucky.

153
00:17:18,055 --> 00:17:20,410
- I get it.
- There's not much to get.

154
00:17:21,855 --> 00:17:24,130
Please, come in.

155
00:17:26,856 --> 00:17:29,209
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

156
00:17:30,054 --> 00:17:35,005
- Would you like some coffee or tea?
- Maybe later.

157
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,649
I appreciate you're coming by on such
short notice.

158
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:43,006
No problem.
What can I do you for?

159
00:17:46,217 --> 00:17:48,776
Mrs. Marino saud that you can fix
anything.

160
00:17:49,257 --> 00:17:52,453
You bend it, I mend it.
Or you break it, I make it.

161
00:17:52,816 --> 00:17:56,253
- Very poetic.
- No, not really.

162
00:17:56,457 --> 00:17:59,255
At least I never wrote one that was
readable.

163
00:17:59,297 --> 00:18:01,652
But you tried.

164
00:18:02,856 --> 00:18:08,411
Yeah, maybe once or twice a long time
ago in the navy.

165
00:18:09,258 --> 00:18:11,977
Something happened between my brain
and my fingers.

166
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:15,137
Guess my hands were made for other
things.

167
00:18:19,938 --> 00:18:23,056
You're a good listener, Mrs. Byron.

168
00:18:24,258 --> 00:18:27,775
I appreciate when people communicate
with each other.

169
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,218
Yeah.

170
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:49,050
I want to know exactly.

171
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,375
- I've looked at the X-rays.
- You know?

172
00:18:52,581 --> 00:18:56,290
I did a part a once where I had
X-ray eyes.

173
00:18:57,861 --> 00:19:02,172
Come in handy, wouldn't it?
God, I did some daft parts.

174
00:19:03,861 --> 00:19:06,249
In
In "The Curse of Count Falco".

175
00:19:06,461 --> 00:19:10,454
That was going to be my last bad part,
I had a good one all lined up but...

176
00:19:10,661 --> 00:19:16,099
...the curse got the real me, too.
Spooky, how that happens.

177
00:19:19,063 --> 00:19:22,293
I played a young widow who was
two months pregnant...

178
00:19:22,502 --> 00:19:26,256
Phyllis, you have a few minor common
conditions.

179
00:19:26,462 --> 00:19:30,501
But I'm afraid there's nothing
really wrong with you.

180
00:19:31,063 --> 00:19:36,376
But um... Oh, well...

181
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:44,413
Life goes on then, doesn't it?

182
00:19:46,063 --> 00:19:49,612
- Is this, 3,500 square feet?
- 3,500. Exactly!

183
00:19:49,903 --> 00:19:52,418
- And you've got a pool.
- Never used it.

184
00:19:56,703 --> 00:20:00,220
I was thinking of making this a
child's room. What do you think?

185
00:20:01,464 --> 00:20:06,219
A child's room? This is nice.
This is really big.

186
00:20:08,425 --> 00:20:12,657
- Are these, yours?
- Just a silly little hobby.

187
00:20:12,865 --> 00:20:15,661
Pretty damn good. You should put them
on the walls.

188
00:20:15,863 --> 00:20:20,461
No. Jeffrey hates them.
They're not very accomplished.

189
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:23,456
Well you could have fooled me.

190
00:20:23,505 --> 00:20:26,066
I don't know what I like,
but I know what art is.

191
00:20:28,065 --> 00:20:30,899
- Is the bedroom behind here?
- Yes.

192
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:33,177
I was thinking.

193
00:20:33,387 --> 00:20:37,425
You could build a door right here
so you keep an eye on him.

194
00:20:37,626 --> 00:20:41,221
- That's always important with a child.
- That would be great.

195
00:20:42,146 --> 00:20:48,220
I've got some pictures here of
a little girl's room I did.

196
00:20:48,425 --> 00:20:53,342
Let's see. That's a gat I did.

197
00:20:58,069 --> 00:21:01,583
Here's Buffoni's. Whatever that is.
Here's this little girl's room.

198
00:21:01,787 --> 00:21:06,067
- Here's the wallpaper that goes.
- I love the moons and stars.

199
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:09,065
- Yeah, that's great, ain't it?
- I love them!

200
00:21:10,428 --> 00:21:14,546
- What do you think?
- Nice. You got a painter's eye.

201
00:21:14,748 --> 00:21:20,026
- I like that. Let's do that.
- Let me get some measurements.

202
00:21:23,469 --> 00:21:27,860
- Are you married, Lucky?
- 24 years to the same gal.

203
00:21:28,068 --> 00:21:31,109
Used to be an actress in California.
Phyllis Hart.

204
00:21:31,311 --> 00:21:34,267
She's on the tube every now and then,
in some old movie.

205
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:39,110
- Any children?
- No.

206
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:45,829
- Can I ask why not?
- It just didn't work out.

207
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:50,268
Phyl's a hell of a gal just for
putting up with me.

208
00:21:50,471 --> 00:21:53,825
I can't imagine you'd be difficult
to live with.

209
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:01,385
I never got past having fund and
not feeling crappy about what I did.

210
00:22:02,871 --> 00:22:09,663
That's all right, though.
She lets me do it, no questions asked.

211
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:14,510
She sounds like a very
secure woman.

212
00:22:16,272 --> 00:22:18,307
I envy that.

213
00:22:20,712 --> 00:22:22,703
Yeah.

214
00:23:26,623 --> 00:23:28,262
Cassie...

215
00:23:34,226 --> 00:23:40,221
Cassie?
Cass... Cass...

216
00:23:40,426 --> 00:23:42,578
Cassie?

217
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:46,063
Cassie it's me!
Cassie! Cassie!

218
00:23:47,547 --> 00:23:52,383
Cassie... Cassie... Cassie...

219
00:23:54,748 --> 00:23:57,547
Cassie! Cassie!

220
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:12,586
Baby I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, baby.

221
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:17,987
Oh, my Cass.
I'm so sorry.

222
00:24:23,232 --> 00:24:25,905
Be coming around at 9 in the morning
if that's okay.

223
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:30,071
- I might make some noise.
- I'll look forward to it.

224
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,991
- "See you later."
- "Yes."

225
00:24:36,514 --> 00:24:38,309
See you!

226
00:24:47,836 --> 00:24:50,225
I'll look forward to it.

227
00:24:51,035 --> 00:24:52,434
"See you later."

228
00:25:04,597 --> 00:25:07,635
- Busy?
- Just doing my nails.

229
00:25:07,838 --> 00:25:12,546
Ornay sure plays cut-throat.
Glad we're on the same side.

230
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:16,392
- Watch it with that.
- Cut-throat.

231
00:25:17,238 --> 00:25:19,833
- That's not funny.
- Excuse me, Mr. Byron.

232
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:23,033
Mr. Ornay's executive assistant
just called.

233
00:25:23,241 --> 00:25:26,037
You look extremely nice again today,
Helene.

234
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,832
- Thank you, sir.
- Ditto, Helene.

235
00:25:28,882 --> 00:25:30,836
You should come in here more often.

236
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:39,797
Mr. Ornay would like to re-schedule
your meeting to this weekend...

237
00:25:39,841 --> 00:25:41,036
...at Chateau Lenore.

238
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:46,002
Rent me a car, and book everything,
me plus one.

239
00:25:48,643 --> 00:25:50,315
Yes, sir.

240
00:25:57,243 --> 00:26:01,124
Ever wonder about women being like
fine wine?

241
00:26:05,844 --> 00:26:08,155
Sort of like kissing your aunt.

242
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,716
Kissing, Donald?

243
00:26:15,646 --> 00:26:17,637
What are you doing?

244
00:26:20,047 --> 00:26:22,038
Impossibilities, Donald.

245
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:26,124
I'm excited about the impossibilities
of things.

246
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,840
- Hey, Lucky.
- Hey, Judy.

247
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:50,201
- Would you get me a beer?
- Coming right up.

248
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:53,531
Hi, babe.

249
00:27:08,214 --> 00:27:10,010
We can't escape the game.

250
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:13,173
I won't even glace at it if you're
going to say something.

251
00:27:13,376 --> 00:27:16,730
No, go ahead. It's nice to see
them whack the little ball.

252
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:20,172
Better than whacking
the little woman.

253
00:27:25,054 --> 00:27:27,252
Maybe you better go a little easy
on the sauce, babe.

254
00:27:27,456 --> 00:27:29,252
Saying something like that?

255
00:27:29,456 --> 00:27:31,765
I haven't touched the sauce.

256
00:27:31,976 --> 00:27:35,255
I've been on the gin. And I never said
you whacked me, Luchy.

257
00:27:35,457 --> 00:27:37,447
Not on the outside.

258
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:40,774
What is it with you, Phyl?

259
00:27:40,979 --> 00:27:44,014
I come in here to have a nice dinner
and already you're firing shots.

260
00:27:44,058 --> 00:27:45,696
What's that?

261
00:27:50,179 --> 00:27:52,373
Okay, alright.

262
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:54,977
What did the doctor say?
What's that about?

263
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:58,252
He said very little indeed.
I seemed to do most of the talking.

264
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,259
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing's wrong with me, Lucky.

265
00:28:01,461 --> 00:28:06,900
- I'm just taking it as I see it.
- And you see plenty, babe.

266
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:14,821
Yeah, from behind my veils...
Like, what's her name, the belly dancer?

267
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:23,894
Like her.
Phyllis and the Seven Veils.

268
00:28:26,624 --> 00:28:31,858
- Dopey, Grumpy, Sleepy...
- Happy.

269
00:28:33,864 --> 00:28:35,138
Happy.

270
00:28:38,866 --> 00:28:41,777
You know the hardest part of all,
Lucky...

271
00:28:42,466 --> 00:28:48,302
...is finding out...
too late, that none of it lasts.

272
00:28:50,867 --> 00:28:54,064
Bulb's got to blow out sooner or later,
babe.

273
00:28:55,426 --> 00:28:58,101
Yes, it's lights out sooner or later.

274
00:28:59,468 --> 00:29:04,020
But you know, the good stuff's still
hiding in the dark.

275
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:10,588
In the afterglow.

276
00:29:13,072 --> 00:29:14,900
I saw Cassie today.

277
00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:21,504
At the Parc des Ecluses. I know it was
her. My body knew it was her.

278
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:25,023
Would you like to order now?
Red sauce, right?

279
00:29:25,073 --> 00:29:26,710
Tomato, yes.

280
00:29:26,911 --> 00:29:29,028
And a little more sauce in here,
please.

281
00:29:29,511 --> 00:29:33,062
It's so much fun seeing you guys.
It's been a while.

282
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:38,952
- Lucky, you still fixing things?
- Still fixing things?

283
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:45,151
The game.

284
00:29:47,874 --> 00:29:49,865
What happened today?

285
00:29:51,075 --> 00:29:55,467
- I didn't see her face.
- Jesus, Phyl. Just let it go.

286
00:29:56,275 --> 00:29:59,870
It won't let me go. Or you.
She ran away from both of us.

287
00:30:00,076 --> 00:30:02,795
She ran away from both of us and
since she isn't coming back, let it go.

288
00:30:02,996 --> 00:30:04,988
It wasn't her today.

289
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:06,868
I didn't for a minute think
she'd be returning to us...

290
00:30:07,078 --> 00:30:12,516
...a couple of selfish fools like us,
but I don't know, after 8 years...

291
00:30:12,718 --> 00:30:16,075
...and we're still here, maybe she
thought it would be safe.

292
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:19,271
I mean, sometimes I think she'll just
appear.

293
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:28,353
Maybe she thinks we've become more...
Ioving?

294
00:30:30,081 --> 00:30:33,198
She was nice, this girl today.
She held herself well.

295
00:30:33,401 --> 00:30:35,676
She was carrying a shopping bag.

296
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,758
- Am I just making it all up?
- Sometimes you lose things, Phyl.

297
00:30:46,881 --> 00:30:49,874
And sometimes you find them.
Just let it be, what it is.

298
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:52,075
It's lost, I know that.

299
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:56,197
I just want to feel happy or unhappy,
just something.

300
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:01,760
You still at the same number, Lucky?

301
00:31:02,964 --> 00:31:03,953
I'll call you.

302
00:31:06,285 --> 00:31:09,914
- Yeah, same number.
- Be right bacvk with the bread.

303
00:31:13,084 --> 00:31:15,076
You still feel lots of things.

304
00:31:15,887 --> 00:31:21,483
Lucky Mann, you great big old octopus...

305
00:31:21,686 --> 00:31:27,955
- All your tentacles waving about.
- What do you want me to say, Phyl?

306
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:30,636
Just what the hell do you want me
to say?

307
00:31:31,687 --> 00:31:35,317
You want me to say that I'm not eager
to dry up and live in the past?

308
00:31:37,089 --> 00:31:40,844
- Not an octopus. An alley-cat.
- Lf you don't like the way things are...

309
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,243
...you can change it.

310
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:46,124
- It's house rules. You set them.
- I wasn't complaining.

311
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:49,322
Don't think I was complaining.
I don't.

312
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:54,889
I just sometimes feel a little pang
when you're out prowling the Ritz.

313
00:31:55,891 --> 00:31:58,885
But what you and your little kittens do
in the privacy of their own basket...

314
00:31:59,094 --> 00:32:01,162
...is none of my business.

315
00:32:01,372 --> 00:32:04,683
Always been an alley-cat,
ain't changing now.

316
00:32:04,893 --> 00:32:07,248
Ain't that how we did it?

317
00:32:10,694 --> 00:32:15,165
Me curling up in your lap two or three
times a day at somebody's private pad.

318
00:32:16,093 --> 00:32:21,771
Remember? Chocolate cream pies,
six pack of beer, and our song.

319
00:32:22,694 --> 00:32:27,167
Sometimes, I'm tempted to find a nice
dark corner at the Ritz...

320
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:30,449
...and watch you in action.

321
00:32:31,697 --> 00:32:33,608
See what I'm missing.

322
00:32:33,855 --> 00:32:38,215
All you got to do is lift the veils,
babe. Any time you say.

323
00:32:49,098 --> 00:32:52,455
He'll bring the written estimate over
today, and he promised...

324
00:32:52,658 --> 00:32:56,937
...that it wouldn't be a dime
over 4,000, for everything.

325
00:32:58,699 --> 00:33:00,895
When did you day it was a platinum
door lock?

326
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,499
I forgot about the door lock.

327
00:33:06,101 --> 00:33:08,490
Get it fixed, Marianne.
Don't worry about it.

328
00:33:08,701 --> 00:33:11,375
Jeffrey, we are going to make these
changes.

329
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:14,496
- We don't need a baby's room.
- Why not?

330
00:33:14,703 --> 00:33:17,580
Because we don't need a baby!

331
00:33:17,782 --> 00:33:20,580
It's a very tough world out there,
Marianne.

332
00:33:20,782 --> 00:33:23,218
Not to mention, overcrowded.

333
00:33:23,423 --> 00:33:27,097
All the more reason to soften it up
a little bit!

334
00:33:28,304 --> 00:33:33,140
Isn't that our job?
Isn't that our purpose, why we're here?

335
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:37,578
To take a flying leap into the future
and spread a little joy along the way?

336
00:33:38,704 --> 00:33:42,699
Tell me something. Why did you bother
getting married?

337
00:33:42,907 --> 00:33:47,138
You don't need kids, you don't need
love, you don't need sex...

338
00:33:47,346 --> 00:33:49,417
...you don't need anything
but yourself!

339
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:53,505
Come to think of it, you're the most
selfish person I've ever met!

340
00:33:57,508 --> 00:34:01,979
For your information, I'm not afraid
to go this alone, Jeffrey.

341
00:34:02,188 --> 00:34:05,100
I'm having a baby,
with or without you!

342
00:34:05,588 --> 00:34:08,901
- Oh, really?
- Really.

343
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:18,062
My, my.
The green-eyed monster.

344
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,868
No.

345
00:34:23,591 --> 00:34:26,947
You're far too stuck on yourself
to be jealous.

346
00:34:41,715 --> 00:34:43,751
If that's what you really want...

347
00:34:47,513 --> 00:34:50,269
...I don't give a good goddamn.

348
00:34:50,715 --> 00:34:53,069
You don't know anything, Jeffrey!

349
00:34:53,595 --> 00:34:55,631
You haven't got a clue!

350
00:34:58,315 --> 00:35:00,307
I'm having this baby!

351
00:35:04,516 --> 00:35:06,506
And you're not invited!

352
00:35:07,116 --> 00:35:09,108
You can't even come!

353
00:35:47,008 --> 00:35:48,511
Good morning, Mr. Byron.

354
00:36:05,132 --> 00:36:08,962
Go away. I don't want to see you
any more.

355
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:32,191
The doorman was going to buzz,
but he got...

356
00:36:33,723 --> 00:36:36,872
It's okay.

357
00:36:37,999 --> 00:36:40,799
Did somebody die?

358
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,515
- Is it physical pain, or danger?
- No.

359
00:36:48,798 --> 00:36:51,073
Then it's going to be all right.

360
00:37:10,794 --> 00:37:12,940
The handy-man is on his way up,
Madame Byron.

361
00:37:13,152 --> 00:37:15,027
"Thank you, Frederico."

362
00:37:16,388 --> 00:37:18,538
You're on your way up.

363
00:37:18,751 --> 00:37:22,342
And I'll be going up and down all
morning. I'm parked out in front.

364
00:37:22,548 --> 00:37:28,623
What must you think?
Catching me off-balance twice in a row?

365
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:32,865
I don't think anything. I just
wouldn't want you to hurt yourself.

366
00:37:34,384 --> 00:37:36,260
I'm a mess.

367
00:37:38,782 --> 00:37:40,773
Would you like some coffee?

368
00:37:40,981 --> 00:37:45,656
Well, if you got an extra front door
key I won't have to bother you at all.

369
00:37:45,862 --> 00:37:50,412
- It'll only be a couple of trips.
- Okay, I'll go get it.

370
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:06,335
Couple of Canadian comedians.

371
00:38:14,932 --> 00:38:17,209
Can I trust you?

372
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:22,161
I never had any complains about
my work, Mrs. Byron.

373
00:38:22,368 --> 00:38:25,282
No, I'm sure you haven't.

374
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:30,562
- Please, call me Marianne.
- I got an estimate here.

375
00:38:30,607 --> 00:38:32,600
Everything's included.

376
00:38:33,568 --> 00:38:36,479
Thank you. And "thank you very much".

377
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:06,911
"I'm coming over!"

378
00:39:07,757 --> 00:39:09,748
I forgot to tell you.

379
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:17,346
What did you forget to tell me?

380
00:39:23,753 --> 00:39:29,665
- Fine, you have it your way.
- For a change.

381
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,661
- We need to tighten that front lock.
- Right.

382
00:40:09,981 --> 00:40:11,971
- Hey, Lucky?
- Yeah?

383
00:40:13,138 --> 00:40:16,368
- I'm awfully glad you're here.
- Yeah.

384
00:40:23,496 --> 00:40:26,327
So, Marianne excited about moonlight
on the lake?

385
00:40:26,533 --> 00:40:30,527
- The big seduction?
- I don't feel like eating at L'AItro again.

386
00:40:30,734 --> 00:40:32,880
Why don't you surprise me?
Take me somewhere new.

387
00:40:34,731 --> 00:40:36,724
Place I'd love to take you.

388
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:42,280
Perfect for a day like this.
My birthday.

389
00:40:45,008 --> 00:40:48,888
I hope you don't mind, this restaurant
seating arrangement's sort of family style.

390
00:40:49,088 --> 00:40:53,126
- Perfect.
- Great.

391
00:40:53,926 --> 00:40:58,281
- We'll have the Lagavulin 16 year.
- Enjoy your meal.

392
00:41:05,123 --> 00:41:09,322
- After 5 years, I know what your drink is.
- I wouldn't know yours.

393
00:41:09,962 --> 00:41:11,953
Because I keep changing.

394
00:41:14,321 --> 00:41:15,913
Well... here we go.

395
00:41:16,121 --> 00:41:19,268
- Thank you. And two more please.
- Yes, sir.

396
00:41:20,238 --> 00:41:23,034
Jeffrey, I've been cooped up way
too long.

397
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:30,756
So, on my birthday, no less it feels
absolutely unspeakable to finally be out.

398
00:41:50,071 --> 00:41:52,062
Is there no end to your horrors?

399
00:41:52,111 --> 00:41:54,782
None whatsoever, but they are not
mine alone.

400
00:41:57,308 --> 00:41:59,820
I think you still do not understand,
dear cousin.

401
00:42:00,025 --> 00:42:01,698
And I think it is time that you did.

402
00:42:01,906 --> 00:42:04,895
The sin of this family has been passed
down through centuries...

403
00:42:04,944 --> 00:42:07,220
and it must cease with our child.

404
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:11,938
Our blight must be removed from
this earth, forever.

405
00:42:12,143 --> 00:42:15,613
- You cannot bury me alive!
- I must, dearest Constance.

406
00:42:15,822 --> 00:42:17,813
There can be no peace without penalty.

407
00:42:32,857 --> 00:42:35,610
I think you still don't understand,
honey.

408
00:42:36,735 --> 00:42:38,965
And I think it's time that you did.

409
00:42:44,773 --> 00:42:47,765
I wouldn't count on it, Count.

410
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:04,806
- Have you ever met his wife?
- My friend worked with her in Hollywood.

411
00:43:05,007 --> 00:43:09,477
- Says she's a bum, from way back.
- No kids for such a long marriage.

412
00:43:10,285 --> 00:43:13,561
My friend said they had a kid,
but she ran away from home.

413
00:43:14,886 --> 00:43:20,322
- God. That's terrible.
- Probably got kids in every port.

414
00:43:36,558 --> 00:43:40,265
We'll put the door here and
lead right into the bedroom.

415
00:43:41,277 --> 00:43:42,676
Good.

416
00:43:42,878 --> 00:43:46,630
Got a little trouble with the electrical
outlet, but I'll take care of that.

417
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:53,189
Excuse me.
I got to get to the saw.

418
00:43:56,673 --> 00:44:00,427
I was on the phone with a friend
of mine...

419
00:44:00,633 --> 00:44:03,624
...and she was saying how hard it
is to...

420
00:44:05,469 --> 00:44:08,746
- Would you like something to drink?
- Later, sure.

421
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:14,178
That's what she was saying,
how hard it is to...

422
00:44:14,386 --> 00:44:20,302
...to meet people and just have a
drink, no strings attached.

423
00:44:20,507 --> 00:44:22,496
Not even sure I approve.

424
00:44:22,543 --> 00:44:24,693
You got to be careful
go for a certain type.

425
00:44:25,865 --> 00:44:28,901
Sounds so calculated.

426
00:44:29,103 --> 00:44:33,096
I mean... this friend of mine...

427
00:44:33,863 --> 00:44:35,850
I didn't know where to tell her.

428
00:44:35,899 --> 00:44:38,734
Where to go so she wouldn't feel
frightened of the consequences.

429
00:44:38,939 --> 00:44:44,456
- Would you hand me the goggles?
- Never really being single myself.

430
00:44:49,055 --> 00:44:52,049
You can't do better than the
Ritz-Carlton downstairs bar...

431
00:44:52,096 --> 00:44:53,495
about 6 in the evening.

432
00:44:53,697 --> 00:44:56,925
It's a little swank and uppity,
but if you're...

433
00:44:57,133 --> 00:45:00,604
...playing the odds,
the favorities...

434
00:45:00,814 --> 00:45:02,802
...it's pretty hard to beat.

435
00:45:03,013 --> 00:45:05,767
- Great. I'll go write that down.
- All right.

436
00:45:08,611 --> 00:45:10,329
Oh, my God!

437
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:23,515
Wow! Okay. Okay.

438
00:45:36,162 --> 00:45:39,872
- So, what's your type?
- What?

439
00:45:40,084 --> 00:45:43,596
- What's your type?
- My type?

440
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,870
When you're being careful.

441
00:45:54,238 --> 00:45:57,353
There's a certain type that I am
careful with.

442
00:45:58,236 --> 00:46:03,227
But I trust the ones that never sleep
around but who feel like getting lucky.

443
00:46:13,233 --> 00:46:16,621
- It's a matter of trust, isn't it?
- Yeah.

444
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:22,868
It's a matter of trust.

445
00:46:23,069 --> 00:46:26,060
My God, you're a fine looking woman.

446
00:46:31,627 --> 00:46:36,619
I forgot the sugar.
I'll go get the sugar.

447
00:48:00,822 --> 00:48:04,860
Marianne, business trip has come up
for this weekend.

448
00:48:06,381 --> 00:48:08,370
I won't be coming home.

449
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:10,282
Afternoon, sir.
You just missed Mrs. Byron.

450
00:49:11,402 --> 00:49:13,518
That so?

451
00:49:56,749 --> 00:50:00,706
Marianne, business trip has come up
for this weekend.

452
00:50:02,347 --> 00:50:03,941
I won't be coming home.

453
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:06,325
No wonder cheating is so popular.

454
00:51:07,529 --> 00:51:10,565
- Do they let the feeling last?
- Who's they?

455
00:51:10,768 --> 00:51:13,724
I don't know. The powers that be,
other people.

456
00:51:13,926 --> 00:51:15,518
Ah, other people.

457
00:51:15,566 --> 00:51:18,364
People ain't going to let you feel very
good for very long anywhere.

458
00:51:18,566 --> 00:51:23,479
They always want your life in agony
over something you don't understand.

459
00:51:23,684 --> 00:51:27,119
They want you to feel bad so
they can feel good.

460
00:51:27,483 --> 00:51:30,871
- How's your life so far?
- My life?

461
00:51:31,841 --> 00:51:33,512
Only one I got.

462
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,072
I want to kiss you in public
right now.

463
00:51:53,515 --> 00:51:57,745
- You've got a beautiful face.
- For stopping doors.

464
00:51:57,953 --> 00:52:01,468
No. I bet you've always been easy
on the eyes.

465
00:52:01,673 --> 00:52:04,902
- Want another drink?
- No, thank you.

466
00:52:05,111 --> 00:52:07,341
- Make that a double.
- You want to go then?

467
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:10,304
Because I forgot to bring my tools
down from the apartment.

468
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:15,824
Remember this, rule number one,
always bring your tools home.

469
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:18,982
- Check!
- Right away, sir.

470
00:52:21,108 --> 00:52:25,065
What did you mean when you said
things dind't work out?

471
00:52:25,905 --> 00:52:28,863
What do you mean?
What didn't work out?

472
00:52:29,905 --> 00:52:31,462
The children.

473
00:52:32,303 --> 00:52:36,536
- That's a touchy subject.
- Okay. Then answer another question.

474
00:52:38,301 --> 00:52:44,057
- Are you setting mine fields?
- How does your wife handle it so well?

475
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:48,688
It has to be difficult.
It has to hurt her.

476
00:52:58,697 --> 00:53:01,415
Phyl and I haven't had sex in a long
while.

477
00:53:03,293 --> 00:53:07,412
It was her choice, her decision.

478
00:53:08,693 --> 00:53:10,170
But I know why.

479
00:53:11,892 --> 00:53:14,884
It came from an argument we had
a long time ago.

480
00:53:16,292 --> 00:53:19,283
And she...

481
00:53:21,291 --> 00:53:24,644
Some stuff got said that we coudln't
take back.

482
00:53:26,488 --> 00:53:28,683
This is how we pay for it.

483
00:53:30,888 --> 00:53:33,321
My husband won't have sex with me,
either.

484
00:53:34,486 --> 00:53:36,044
Or he can't.

485
00:53:36,885 --> 00:53:39,035
He hasn't said which.

486
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:42,874
So there you go.

487
00:53:44,401 --> 00:53:46,313
There you go.

488
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:38,942
- Stand by. I may need you later.
- Yes, Mr. Byron.

489
00:54:44,825 --> 00:54:46,976
Welcome to the Ritz-Carlton.
May I help you?

490
00:54:47,186 --> 00:54:49,254
A suite.

491
00:54:49,664 --> 00:54:57,170
- A one-bedroom or a juniro executive?
- One bedroom, for two weeks.

492
00:54:57,381 --> 00:55:00,692
- Two weeks.
- Where is the bar?

493
00:55:00,902 --> 00:55:04,211
There's one downstairs through those
arches.

494
00:55:27,614 --> 00:55:30,332
Will you run me a tab?

495
00:55:47,328 --> 00:55:48,966
Thanks.

496
00:56:04,883 --> 00:56:07,840
- How rude!
- Probably an American.

497
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,310
Smoke gets in your eyes.

498
00:56:22,078 --> 00:56:24,591
Kern-Hammerstein.

499
00:56:28,795 --> 00:56:31,629
A bottle of Dom Perignon and
two glasses.

500
00:56:38,556 --> 00:56:40,827
I'm not completely without charm.

501
00:56:41,752 --> 00:56:44,949
In fact, I live up to the very edge
of my charm.

502
00:56:45,312 --> 00:56:47,380
Is that so?

503
00:56:49,749 --> 00:56:52,139
Being a woman of clever perception and
remarkable beauty you may have noticed...

504
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:53,984
...that already.

505
00:56:54,948 --> 00:56:59,817
- I noticed your wedding ring.
- You're English.

506
00:57:01,346 --> 00:57:05,497
- It's removable.
- Does your wife know that?

507
00:57:06,545 --> 00:57:09,695
If we see her, we can ask her.

508
00:57:09,904 --> 00:57:12,179
I came here to spy on her.

509
00:57:15,543 --> 00:57:21,093
But, she may be elsewhere engaging
in oral copulation or the like.

510
00:57:32,337 --> 00:57:35,408
- And tomorrow?
- I never leave a job unfinished.

511
00:57:40,536 --> 00:57:41,934
My hero.

512
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:47,325
Well, all right, I guess...

513
00:57:50,492 --> 00:57:52,926
You forgot your tool box.

514
00:57:53,134 --> 00:57:57,727
Jesus! I've never done that before.
Said the sailor to the girl.

515
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:03,882
Eight thirty. Jesus!
Shit!

516
00:58:06,527 --> 00:58:08,595
Better be careful, Lucky.

517
00:58:09,566 --> 00:58:13,081
If you fall in love with me,
you're going to need two of everything.

518
00:58:19,724 --> 00:58:21,839
- See you.
- Bye-bye.

519
00:58:27,362 --> 00:58:30,477
...make a stimulating companion,
don't you think?

520
00:58:30,682 --> 00:58:31,670
She might.

521
00:58:31,881 --> 00:58:35,758
I could ask her to accompany me
tomorrow to Chateau Lenore...

522
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:39,590
...for an all-expenses-paid weekend
in the mountains.

523
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:42,708
But I'd like to ask you.

524
00:58:44,317 --> 00:58:46,750
You certainly are up to the edge
of something.

525
00:58:47,835 --> 00:58:53,227
The mountains... could be dangerous.

526
00:58:56,714 --> 00:59:00,148
You are the most fascinating woman
I've ever met in my entire life.

527
00:59:02,112 --> 00:59:05,342
Yes. I know.

528
00:59:07,709 --> 00:59:11,589
What is your husband doing right now?

529
00:59:15,668 --> 00:59:17,862
Same thing as your life.

530
00:59:20,906 --> 00:59:25,457
Well... I do hope they're enjoying
themselves as much as we are.

531
00:59:27,345 --> 00:59:29,142
I don't.

532
00:59:57,896 --> 00:59:59,647
See you later.

533
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:06,808
It is later, for chrissake.

534
01:00:13,491 --> 01:00:18,609
I love the sound of wet tires.
It reminds me of the movies.

535
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:23,681
You a movie star?

536
01:00:25,488 --> 01:00:28,320
- I'm an actress.
- Really?

537
01:00:28,527 --> 01:00:30,519
All the time.

538
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:36,442
- My card, Madam.
- Very gallant, I'm sure.

539
01:00:37,446 --> 01:00:40,116
I can't see without my glasses.

540
01:00:41,083 --> 01:00:45,951
In case you never find them,
my name is Jeffrey Byron the third.

541
01:00:46,162 --> 01:00:47,753
The third what?

542
01:00:47,961 --> 01:00:50,350
Whatever it was they were making.

543
01:00:50,561 --> 01:00:53,710
There will not be a fourth.
We Byrons quit when we get it right.

544
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:00,671
- Watch it!
- I'm watching. I don't want to miss anything.

545
01:01:00,877 --> 01:01:03,074
Don't worry, nothing's happening.

546
01:01:03,878 --> 01:01:05,867
Come with me this weekend.

547
01:01:06,675 --> 01:01:11,031
Moonlight on the lake...
four stars on the menu.

548
01:01:12,034 --> 01:01:16,823
- Someone like you deserves at least that.
- Believe me.

549
01:01:17,033 --> 01:01:21,151
I am getting exactly what I deserve.

550
01:02:05,459 --> 01:02:11,054
- Dream's over. Wake up.
- Never.

551
01:02:12,656 --> 01:02:16,045
I'm staying at the Ritz-Carlton.
Room nine one eight.

552
01:02:16,258 --> 01:02:18,849
I'll s end a car, anything you like.

553
01:02:20,055 --> 01:02:26,242
Look, the third... you're a real
charmer, you really are very cute.

554
01:02:26,453 --> 01:02:28,488
I just want the privilege of your
company.

555
01:02:28,692 --> 01:02:31,158
I promise, no sex beyond what I've done.

556
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:37,169
We're done, done.

557
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:44,926
Champagne always makes me feel
like my shoes are off.

558
01:03:07,642 --> 01:03:10,279
- Thanks for the lift.
- Don't mention it.

559
01:03:13,641 --> 01:03:16,710
- Hotel, please.
- Yes, Mr. Byron.

560
01:04:16,222 --> 01:04:19,054
Where the hell have you been?
What time is it?

561
01:04:35,017 --> 01:04:40,169
- What are you doing, babe?
- I'm making you better.

562
01:04:44,011 --> 01:04:46,003
I'm kissing you better.

563
01:04:54,572 --> 01:04:59,166
Honey, come on, please.

564
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:02,127
I'm feeling really beat up tonight.

565
01:05:02,328 --> 01:05:07,162
That's all right. I'm feeling up,
honey. I'm sorry.

566
01:05:10,005 --> 01:05:12,998
- And I was kissing you!
- Jesus...

567
01:05:17,202 --> 01:05:19,195
What is wrong with you?

568
01:05:23,201 --> 01:05:26,002
Fucking bastard!

569
01:05:26,204 --> 01:05:30,512
- Fuck you! Get off me right now!
- What the hell is wrong with you?

570
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:34,950
Lucky, bloody well get off me.

571
01:05:35,198 --> 01:05:38,076
You're hurting me!

572
01:06:01,992 --> 01:06:07,700
Just a sudden craving for chocolate
cream pie and a sip of beer.

573
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:14,619
And our very own song.

574
01:06:32,783 --> 01:06:37,171
- Hello?
- Mr. Byron, did I wake you up?

575
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:41,612
I got your message this morning.
Shall I phone back?

576
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:44,379
No, no, no.

577
01:06:44,579 --> 01:06:46,570
What's happening with the car?

578
01:06:46,779 --> 01:06:49,735
Mr. Duncan said he would take care
of the car.

579
01:06:49,937 --> 01:06:53,373
- Is everything all right, sir?
- Yes.

580
01:06:53,577 --> 01:06:57,567
I have made arrangements to come
over if you're still considering...

581
01:06:57,774 --> 01:07:03,211
...the possibility of a driver.
- No, thank you. That won't be necessary.

582
01:07:04,975 --> 01:07:06,692
Yes, sir.

583
01:07:43,562 --> 01:07:47,712
Bastard, not even a good-bye kiss.

584
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:51,550
Are you up, Phyl?

585
01:07:57,959 --> 01:08:02,234
Up for just about anything.
How about you?

586
01:08:03,356 --> 01:08:05,505
See you for dinner.

587
01:08:08,354 --> 01:08:10,345
Enjoy your work.

588
01:09:10,098 --> 01:09:14,725
Surprised?
Packed and ready to go.

589
01:09:19,134 --> 01:09:21,931
Not with you.
I'm quitting the office.

590
01:09:22,133 --> 01:09:25,761
You're quitting?
I didn't ask you to do that, Donald.

591
01:09:27,131 --> 01:09:29,123
I'll open up my own restaurant.

592
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:32,284
Let's have lunch some time, eh?

593
01:09:40,127 --> 01:09:42,119
Jeffey by daylight.

594
01:09:58,284 --> 01:10:01,274
- We need champagne.
- It's a little early.

595
01:10:01,442 --> 01:10:05,911
No, to christen it, silly.
I want to try.

596
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:10,636
No way, that's heavy. Be careful.
All right, then hit it right here.

597
01:10:17,077 --> 01:10:22,150
- Lady wins a stuffed animal.
- I was thinking of Jeffrey.

598
01:10:23,716 --> 01:10:27,833
I want my stuffed animal, Lucky.
I want millions of them.

599
01:10:28,115 --> 01:10:30,105
This is a baby's room.

600
01:10:34,513 --> 01:10:38,025
I'll shove off a little early. I'll
swing by the lumber yard on my way home.

601
01:10:39,311 --> 01:10:42,507
- I could make you dinner if you like.
- No.

602
01:10:44,311 --> 01:10:50,019
Don't worry, Lucky. I'm not going to
ask anything of your time, or of you.

603
01:10:50,229 --> 01:10:56,497
- I'm perfectly willing to go this alone.
- Isn't there something in between?

604
01:11:06,903 --> 01:11:11,258
I love the way you smell.
Like a man.

605
01:11:12,302 --> 01:11:14,576
Jeffrey smells like soap.

606
01:11:15,901 --> 01:11:19,731
The only thing him and me got in
common is you.

607
01:11:26,297 --> 01:11:29,495
Haven't seen this kind of splendor
since "Bambi".

608
01:11:31,416 --> 01:11:33,406
I'd rather look at you.

609
01:11:35,296 --> 01:11:39,730
- Is this some kind of mother thing?
- Mother would never approve of this.

610
01:11:41,694 --> 01:11:43,729
My daughter's about your age.

611
01:11:43,931 --> 01:11:48,289
Well, a few years younger maybe.

612
01:11:49,971 --> 01:11:54,202
- She's the reason we came to Montreal.
- From England?

613
01:11:55,489 --> 01:11:57,604
No, not from England.

614
01:11:58,967 --> 01:12:02,006
- She's beautiful, I'm sure.
- Yes.

615
01:12:03,368 --> 01:12:07,757
Young and beautiful, like you.

616
01:12:09,446 --> 01:12:11,958
Just a kid, like you.

617
01:12:13,284 --> 01:12:18,516
I'm not a kid.
A kid wouldn't know how to handle you.

618
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:10,459
Entertaining a new client, laddie?

619
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:14,497
Ornay.

620
01:13:15,267 --> 01:13:18,814
May I introduce, Monica Bloom,
my research associate.

621
01:13:20,666 --> 01:13:23,382
And you certainly do look familiar.

622
01:13:23,584 --> 01:13:26,017
I have been know to be,
from time to time.

623
01:13:27,783 --> 01:13:32,649
- Bernard Ornay, meet Phyllis...
- Hart, I'm his mistress.

624
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:41,737
- He must be lucky.
- I find him very different from Lucky.

625
01:13:43,858 --> 01:13:45,849
- So?
- So?

626
01:13:45,898 --> 01:13:48,458
- Dinner at 8?
- A pleasure.

627
01:13:59,654 --> 01:14:03,769
Did I mention?
Separate rooms.

628
01:14:28,843 --> 01:14:31,678
See you in a few days,
don't way up.

629
01:14:35,242 --> 01:14:37,961
Good evening, Mrs. Byron.
Mr. Byron isn't home as yet.

630
01:14:38,162 --> 01:14:44,952
- Did the handy-man come back?
- No. Are you expecting him this evening?

631
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:49,438
- I suppose not. "Good evening".
- "Good evening, Madam".

632
01:16:20,613 --> 01:16:24,492
Jack Dana and Dirk O'Brien were in it.

633
01:16:24,693 --> 01:16:27,329
It was a stupid film.

634
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:31,967
The director was bad.
He hadn't a clue about acting.

635
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:36,923
And Jack was very serious about
this work.

636
01:16:37,128 --> 01:16:41,918
I was always trying to soothe him.
He had the most terrible temper.

637
01:16:42,127 --> 01:16:46,995
And on the last day, Jack and
the director has this huge row.

638
01:16:47,805 --> 01:16:53,799
And the director, just like that,
cut us out of the big scene...

639
01:16:54,003 --> 01:16:56,596
...and gave all our lines to other
actors.

640
01:16:58,003 --> 01:17:03,394
I couldn't believe it. Jack and I
ended up in Dirk's dressing room.

641
01:17:03,601 --> 01:17:05,716
And we got completely blotto.

642
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:13,427
Dirk suggested that we hide during
lunch, in the closet, on the set.

643
01:17:13,636 --> 01:17:15,911
And when they came back and did the
scene...

644
01:17:16,116 --> 01:17:19,951
...we would open the closet door
and deliver our last lines.

645
01:17:22,795 --> 01:17:30,792
But we were in that bloody closet for
about an hour before anyone came back...

646
01:17:32,793 --> 01:17:35,827
And we were drunk...

647
01:17:36,030 --> 01:17:40,069
And... Jack was my pal.

648
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:43,579
And he was very attractive.

649
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:45,825
My husband was in the navy at the time.

650
01:17:48,587 --> 01:17:51,624
And I got pregnant in that closet.

651
01:17:57,386 --> 01:18:01,138
Well, tha's it. That's the story.

652
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:05,383
The most unbelievable coming-out-of-
the-closet story I've ever heard.

653
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:11,459
- How about you, laddie?
- Well, I've heard two this weekend.

654
01:18:11,661 --> 01:18:14,492
This is by far the more compelling.

655
01:18:14,699 --> 01:18:18,294
True confessions again, I'm afraid.
Better send me to bed with no pudding.

656
01:18:19,577 --> 01:18:22,012
I have exactly the opposite in mind.

657
01:18:23,378 --> 01:18:27,527
I want to dance.
Somebody dance with me.

658
01:18:29,976 --> 01:18:34,207
So, what did your husband say when
he found out?

659
01:18:36,295 --> 01:18:39,284
- He didn't.
- He didn't?

660
01:18:39,492 --> 01:18:40,482
Not then.

661
01:18:42,372 --> 01:18:45,840
I waited 15 years to tell him.

662
01:18:47,251 --> 01:18:50,685
I thought we were safe,
we had a good marriage.

663
01:18:50,889 --> 01:18:54,564
We had fun, we used to go dancing.

664
01:18:55,569 --> 01:19:00,844
We were in love, for God sakes.
We had rows of course, but who doesn't?

665
01:19:01,045 --> 01:19:09,201
We made sense to each other.

666
01:19:10,564 --> 01:19:13,442
And I thought I could tell him
in a way he'd be able to handle.

667
01:19:15,763 --> 01:19:17,754
I thought we were safe.

668
01:19:17,964 --> 01:19:21,749
I thought we were that safe thing
called family.

669
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:27,674
It was all right, at first.
We were both calm.

670
01:19:30,759 --> 01:19:37,230
And then... he lost his mind.

671
01:19:38,756 --> 01:19:40,746
He started screaming...

672
01:19:41,755 --> 01:19:46,349
She's not mine!

673
01:19:47,552 --> 01:19:49,545
And she heard him.

674
01:19:49,754 --> 01:19:52,949
He didn't mean it. He loved her more
than anything on earth.

675
01:19:54,511 --> 01:19:56,741
But she heard him.

676
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:04,220
It must have broken her heart.

677
01:20:07,346 --> 01:20:11,135
We lost it all.

678
01:20:19,344 --> 01:20:21,983
Jack Dana never did know.

679
01:20:24,224 --> 01:20:29,739
- So you had the child?
- Of course I had the child.

680
01:20:29,781 --> 01:20:32,453
Of course I did.

681
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:37,376
"Fascinating!"

682
01:20:39,338 --> 01:20:42,330
Bernard?
Come and dance with me.

683
01:20:43,137 --> 01:20:49,213
No, no. I want to tell Miss Hart
about my own acting fantasies.

684
01:20:50,376 --> 01:20:53,013
Why don't you dance with Monica,
laddie?

685
01:20:54,774 --> 01:20:57,368
Sorry, Horny.

686
01:20:58,133 --> 01:21:01,966
Well, who needs a partner to dance?

687
01:21:03,731 --> 01:21:05,847
All of a sudden, I feel like
Scarlet O'Hara.

688
01:21:06,091 --> 01:21:11,004
I duly regret I must take my leave.
Don't stand, gentlemen.

689
01:21:12,527 --> 01:21:15,679
The pleasure has been all mine.

690
01:21:35,322 --> 01:21:38,119
When they said you were good
at putting people together laddie...

691
01:21:38,321 --> 01:21:40,709
...I didn't realize just how good.

692
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:44,673
If you call me laddie one more time,
after you pay for dinner...

693
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:46,710
...your next drink will be from
the lake.

694
01:21:46,919 --> 01:21:50,433
I've paid for nothing yet.
Nothing is signed.

695
01:21:50,718 --> 01:21:55,110
And if you continue on like this
quite probably I won't.

696
01:21:55,318 --> 01:22:00,993
That's waht drives a lemming like you,
isn't it? The probability of things.

697
01:22:01,196 --> 01:22:03,754
Very boring predictability.

698
01:22:03,954 --> 01:22:08,629
Corporate takeovers, bimbo girlfriends,
fertility cycles.

699
01:22:09,913 --> 01:22:11,902
You fool!

700
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:18,661
For a king, Horny, for a true king,
the impossible is far more rewarding...

701
01:22:18,707 --> 01:22:20,621
...than the probable!

702
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:23,706
Take a flying leap into the future!

703
01:22:23,908 --> 01:22:25,899
See what the hell is out there!

704
01:22:26,708 --> 01:22:28,699
She's always saying that.

705
01:22:28,908 --> 01:22:31,500
Take a flying leap into the future,
Horny!

706
01:22:41,423 --> 01:22:45,097
Aw! Jesus, fuck!

707
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:56,576
Hi. Look, I'm sorry, it's late.

708
01:22:58,699 --> 01:23:02,486
You want to go somewhere?
Have a quiet beer?

709
01:23:08,856 --> 01:23:10,129
Ough!

710
01:23:10,895 --> 01:23:12,885
- Thank you.
- For what?

711
01:23:13,094 --> 01:23:16,882
- For going bowling.
- Anything's possible.

712
01:23:17,893 --> 01:23:20,487
- No, it's too late for most things.
- Why?

713
01:23:21,692 --> 01:23:24,726
- Other people, for openers.
- Your only reason?

714
01:23:25,610 --> 01:23:28,203
I wouldn't know how.

715
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:31,684
They say it's just a matter of too much
or too little.

716
01:23:45,724 --> 01:23:48,998
"Just two seconds and I'll be..."

717
01:24:42,268 --> 01:24:43,667
Go away.

718
01:24:49,786 --> 01:24:54,336
- Who is that?
- Room service.

719
01:24:55,543 --> 01:24:57,535
Pudding in bed.

720
01:25:02,462 --> 01:25:04,418
You're not going to deny that urge,
are you?

721
01:25:04,462 --> 01:25:05,736
What?

722
01:25:07,461 --> 01:25:09,657
My sweet tooth?

723
01:25:11,061 --> 01:25:14,416
No. Mine.

724
01:25:30,055 --> 01:25:32,046
I want to know more of you.

725
01:25:33,855 --> 01:25:37,049
What does that mean wanting to know
you?

726
01:25:37,252 --> 01:25:41,006
- Beats me.
- Why don't you ask me?

727
01:25:42,850 --> 01:25:45,365
Why would I ask you anything, laddie?

728
01:25:46,652 --> 01:25:48,641
Please!

729
01:25:50,849 --> 01:25:54,636
- The choice seems to be yours.
- Lf only that were true.

730
01:25:54,848 --> 01:25:58,395
But lovely of you think so,
thanks ever so much.

731
01:25:59,646 --> 01:26:04,798
Perhaps another time.

732
01:26:16,441 --> 01:26:19,161
I have some phone calls I have
to make in the morning.

733
01:26:21,839 --> 01:26:25,037
We leave around noon,
is that all right?

734
01:26:32,237 --> 01:26:34,430
I'm in no hurry.

735
01:26:41,233 --> 01:26:44,226
It's all right.
It's okay.

736
01:27:05,427 --> 01:27:08,975
A clever ruse, that's all it is.
Sexuality.

737
01:27:09,626 --> 01:27:13,457
- I beg your pardon?
- Not just us, everyone.

738
01:27:13,823 --> 01:27:15,654
Oh, them.

739
01:27:16,824 --> 01:27:20,817
I mean, what is wrong with sexual
modesty? Tell me that.

740
01:27:22,223 --> 01:27:25,420
You mean, exercising restraint?

741
01:27:26,781 --> 01:27:31,614
- Well, it's good and it's bad.
- Right. It's good and it's bad.

742
01:27:31,819 --> 01:27:37,734
- The eternal marriage.
- Marriage. You mean happy ever after.

743
01:28:36,802 --> 01:28:43,239
I want a divorce.

744
01:28:49,918 --> 01:28:52,907
- I want a divorce.
- We are not married.

745
01:28:53,195 --> 01:28:57,188
If a woman is loved and treated well
life can be quite simple.

746
01:28:57,355 --> 01:29:01,586
But, if necessary, she is just as
capable of living like a man.

747
01:29:06,192 --> 01:29:09,025
Why would you wnat to do something
like that?

748
01:29:10,951 --> 01:29:14,182
Most marriages don't work out anyway.

749
01:29:18,349 --> 01:29:22,341
- Do I look like an explorer?
- An explorer?

750
01:29:24,387 --> 01:29:29,744
Let's see. To be an explorer you have
to put your hands on your hips.

751
01:29:29,986 --> 01:29:33,580
To be a man stick your chest out.
Act cocky.

752
01:29:36,586 --> 01:29:39,973
You know?

753
01:29:40,982 --> 01:29:47,897
I think women should stay women.

754
01:29:49,580 --> 01:29:54,448
You know, completely women.

755
01:29:56,379 --> 01:30:00,767
- Uniquely women.
- What about children, Lucky?

756
01:30:06,774 --> 01:30:11,370
When Phyl sat me down and told me that
I wasn't the father of my daughter...

757
01:30:12,854 --> 01:30:16,368
...I just sat there in shock.
I was numb.

758
01:30:18,572 --> 01:30:20,766
What a betrayal.

759
01:30:22,571 --> 01:30:28,120
So I just got up and said that I needed
to think it over and needed some time.

760
01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:30,320
And I went down to a bar.

761
01:30:31,567 --> 01:30:36,277
I sat down at the bar and had a couple
of drinks, and it just started cooking.

762
01:30:36,487 --> 01:30:39,761
How the tell could she do this to me?

763
01:30:39,965 --> 01:30:41,958
To Cassie, for Christ's sake?

764
01:30:42,167 --> 01:30:45,553
I got so pissed off I went back to the
house and I'm just sreaming at her.

765
01:30:45,763 --> 01:30:47,800
I'm yelling, throwing things.

766
01:30:48,004 --> 01:30:51,233
I said, "we don't have a child together.
You have a child, not me."

767
01:30:51,442 --> 01:30:55,560
You, selfish sonovabitch!
She ain't mine, goddamit!

768
01:30:57,759 --> 01:30:59,876
I think that's what Cassie heard.

769
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:04,755
In the morning, I went down
to the room, she was gone.

770
01:31:05,957 --> 01:31:07,949
A couple of weeks went by.

771
01:31:09,357 --> 01:31:13,395
We got a letter.
It was from here, Montreal.

772
01:31:14,556 --> 01:31:18,149
She said that she never wanted to see
us again.

773
01:31:18,355 --> 01:31:20,743
We weren't fit to be her parents.

774
01:31:20,954 --> 01:31:26,152
It just killed Phyllis.
God, it just killed her.

775
01:31:26,553 --> 01:31:30,021
She wanted to come here, to find Cassie.

776
01:31:30,231 --> 01:31:32,380
So I sold the house, we moved.

777
01:31:40,668 --> 01:31:45,422
Phyl still thinks she sees her now
and then, but it's been 8 years.

778
01:31:46,747 --> 01:31:49,544
I've given up.

779
01:31:49,787 --> 01:31:53,174
Every once in a while I catch myself
searching the faces.

780
01:31:57,743 --> 01:32:01,735
I don't know if I really want do find
her.

781
01:32:04,942 --> 01:32:07,933
Because I don't know how I'd feel.

782
01:32:18,936 --> 01:32:23,248
- Can I buy you a drink, at least?
- What a great mind you have!

783
01:32:30,334 --> 01:32:32,289
Here?

784
01:32:36,530 --> 01:32:38,521
I'll have gin and tonic.

785
01:32:54,528 --> 01:32:57,834
Get off him!
Leave him alone!

786
01:32:58,564 --> 01:33:01,637
Leave him alone, Jeffrey!

787
01:33:06,244 --> 01:33:09,950
- Take him!
- Leave him. Stop it!

788
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:11,993
I want to talk to that man!

789
01:33:12,202 --> 01:33:15,716
- I want to talk to that man!
- I'm right outside!

790
01:33:16,319 --> 01:33:19,835
- She's with me.
- Take it easy. Take it easy.

791
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:24,953
- What he's been doing with my wife?
- What?

792
01:33:25,318 --> 01:33:27,275
- I'm not going to cause any trouble.
- You wouldn't understand even...

793
01:33:27,319 --> 01:33:28,512
if I told you, Jeffrey!

794
01:33:29,516 --> 01:33:33,350
Tell them to be careful with that guy.
He's cute.

795
01:33:33,556 --> 01:33:37,673
- Who are you?
- Oh! I'm with him.

796
01:33:39,114 --> 01:33:42,105
- You're with my husband.
- I am really sorry...

797
01:33:46,512 --> 01:33:50,661
Why don't we all meet at your place?
I think everybody knows where that is.

798
01:33:56,310 --> 01:34:02,066
- All right.
- Now walk away.

799
01:34:02,107 --> 01:34:04,097
My truck's up that way.

800
01:34:26,621 --> 01:34:28,610
What did you do with my car?

801
01:34:35,298 --> 01:34:36,889
Get out of the way!

802
01:34:38,297 --> 01:34:41,732
- How did you meet my husband?
- Rather he met me.

803
01:34:41,936 --> 01:34:45,530
- Did you sleep with him?
- Sleep with him? No.

804
01:34:45,735 --> 01:34:48,326
- I didn't sleep with him.
- Frigid, isn't he?

805
01:34:48,532 --> 01:34:49,568
Frigid?

806
01:35:03,329 --> 01:35:09,402
Tell me, is it true what they say
about the laboring classes?

807
01:35:09,607 --> 01:35:14,045
I mean, did he give you everything
you need?

808
01:35:14,886 --> 01:35:20,357
- He's the most sexual man I've ever met.
- Really?

809
01:35:21,563 --> 01:35:23,759
How many men have you met?

810
01:35:26,283 --> 01:35:28,476
Two.

811
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,508
"Good morning, Pedro."

812
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:43,668
Excuse the mess. I'm doing a little
remodeling.

813
01:35:44,678 --> 01:35:49,546
- That's how we met.
- Wonderful!

814
01:35:52,875 --> 01:35:57,868
- Would you like something to drink?
- Gin.

815
01:35:58,074 --> 01:36:04,511
- I'll make some coffee, too.
- Yes. That'd be good.

816
01:36:17,028 --> 01:36:22,339
This is my favorite. We're still in the
process of making it into a baby's room.

817
01:36:25,667 --> 01:36:29,374
- We?
- Yeah, he's been helping me.

818
01:36:29,585 --> 01:36:34,657
- Are you pregnant?
- I won't know for a few days...

819
01:36:34,703 --> 01:36:36,693
...but I have that feeling.

820
01:36:37,983 --> 01:36:42,929
- Bully for you.
- And you? Any children?

821
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:45,134
A daughter.

822
01:36:45,342 --> 01:36:47,854
- Does she live here?
- Visiting.

823
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:54,094
So... Do you know who the father is?

824
01:37:00,614 --> 01:37:03,847
Well, he's a lucky man.

825
01:37:06,015 --> 01:37:09,689
I'll have to leave now.
This has suddenly become...

826
01:37:09,894 --> 01:37:12,453
...a little crazy.

827
01:37:12,653 --> 01:37:15,245
It's funny you would say that.

828
01:37:19,849 --> 01:37:23,399
Mr. Byron, good evening.
It's a beautiful ev...

829
01:37:23,450 --> 01:37:24,565
Your car.
Could I get...

830
01:37:25,850 --> 01:37:28,760
- Have you told him?
- No, he knows nothing.

831
01:37:28,808 --> 01:37:30,799
Just be sure you tell him.

832
01:37:31,008 --> 01:37:35,204
Mr. Byron, Mrs. Byron and another
woman have just arrived.

833
01:37:40,123 --> 01:37:43,434
Sir, that's far too fast.
This is a residential area.

834
01:37:45,563 --> 01:37:48,474
I could make you another one.

835
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:04,394
You know what?
I'm starting to enjoy myself.

836
01:38:05,437 --> 01:38:07,428
No, I really am.

837
01:38:11,515 --> 01:38:15,826
- What are you doing here?
- You, fucking bastard!

838
01:38:16,234 --> 01:38:19,829
- Ough!
- Get out from in front of the door.

839
01:38:19,954 --> 01:38:24,185
- You! Come here!
- Come on! I'm just the handyman.

840
01:38:24,233 --> 01:38:25,789
Get inside!

841
01:38:27,231 --> 01:38:30,540
- Come here. Come here, Phyllis!
- Phyllis!

842
01:38:41,227 --> 01:38:43,218
And don't you dare follow me.

843
01:38:45,585 --> 01:38:47,778
Errol bloody Flynn.

844
01:39:03,622 --> 01:39:07,134
Do you know her? You said Phyllis.
How do you know her name?

845
01:39:10,618 --> 01:39:13,177
How did you know her name?

846
01:39:13,616 --> 01:39:16,416
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

847
01:39:16,618 --> 01:39:20,085
Any time, big guy!
And you know where I live!

848
01:39:22,016 --> 01:39:26,405
- Does he know her?
- What?

849
01:39:28,014 --> 01:39:30,006
- Is this free?
- Yeah.

850
01:39:31,613 --> 01:39:34,206
- Did a woman come out here?
- Yeah, in the taxi.

851
01:39:37,411 --> 01:39:39,685
Phyllis, come on, open the door!

852
01:39:42,410 --> 01:39:45,718
Lucky, I've seen you with her.
I know what's going on.

853
01:39:45,928 --> 01:39:47,361
And that isn't part of the deal.
You know that's not part of the deal.

854
01:39:47,408 --> 01:39:49,046
Please go.

855
01:39:49,248 --> 01:39:51,238
- No. Listen to me, come on!
- It's over, it's finished.

856
01:39:51,287 --> 01:39:52,799
I don't want to see you again.

857
01:39:53,006 --> 01:39:57,476
Don't you dare come home. I don't want
anything more to do with you.

858
01:39:57,525 --> 01:39:58,400
Shit!

859
01:40:51,029 --> 01:40:53,065
We were great.

860
01:41:00,586 --> 01:41:03,020
Where are you going?

861
01:41:11,104 --> 01:41:14,255
We all go a little mad sometimes,
Marianne.

862
01:41:15,983 --> 01:41:18,177
But we were great.

863
01:42:23,364 --> 01:42:27,913
You cannot mar the bright and perfect
flower that will be my child.

864
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:32,600
You can say that again, sister.

865
01:42:40,358 --> 01:42:44,748
You cannot mar the bright and perfect
flower that will be my child.

866
01:42:59,152 --> 01:43:02,065
So, does Jeffrey know yet?
It's his, isn't it?

867
01:43:03,552 --> 01:43:06,019
Of course Jeffrey's the father.

868
01:43:06,231 --> 01:43:13,226
This child is going to bring us together
and keep us close in a family sense.

869
01:43:14,748 --> 01:43:21,187
- But, for right now, we're separated.
- Separated? Marianne! That's impossible!

870
01:43:44,339 --> 01:43:45,329
Mr. Byron?

871
01:43:59,336 --> 01:44:01,327
Is hot in here, huh?

872
01:44:23,249 --> 01:44:26,321
I think I broke my goddamn leg.

873
01:44:42,683 --> 01:44:47,153
Listen. Outside currents on the
winds...

874
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:51,996
To the world, I am announcing,
I am about to urinate.

875
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,355
Only pigs could see the wings.

876
01:45:02,717 --> 01:45:07,108
The black hole.
Ever seen who I was?

877
01:45:09,714 --> 01:45:15,346
Could be taken for two hundred miles.
Twinkle, twinkle, little spectrum...

878
01:45:15,554 --> 01:45:18,546
...big kids come when you least
expect them.

879
01:45:21,911 --> 01:45:24,185
You went away, my heart went with you.

880
01:45:25,111 --> 01:45:27,260
Where? Where?

881
01:45:39,707 --> 01:45:41,298
Cassie?

882
01:45:45,305 --> 01:45:48,978
Cassie? Cassie?

883
01:45:54,981 --> 01:45:56,255
Cassie?

884
01:45:59,301 --> 01:46:00,290
Cassie?

885
01:46:11,498 --> 01:46:15,728
It is you, isn't it?
Cassie? It's you, isn't it?

886
01:46:17,096 --> 01:46:21,566
Oh, my God, Cassie, you're beautiful.

887
01:46:24,294 --> 01:46:27,842
Cassie, please forgive me.

888
01:46:28,891 --> 01:46:32,600
I'm so sorry.
Honey, I am so sorry.

889
01:46:38,291 --> 01:46:40,200
Honey, please...

890
01:46:43,488 --> 01:46:44,807
Cassie, I...

891
01:46:54,285 --> 01:46:57,515
Bye-bye.
Take care of yourself.

892
01:47:17,879 --> 01:47:19,868
"I love you."

893
01:47:45,472 --> 01:47:47,620
"I love you."

894
01:47:56,067 --> 01:47:57,261
Marianne?

895
01:48:28,658 --> 01:48:32,127
Your father, an adulterer.

896
01:48:33,737 --> 01:48:36,455
Your best friend...

897
01:48:37,935 --> 01:48:43,566
Someday a time for us.

898
01:48:46,453 --> 01:48:48,647
Time together...

899
01:48:50,053 --> 01:48:53,441
...a time to spare.

900
01:48:55,050 --> 01:48:58,645
Time to learn.

901
01:49:00,050 --> 01:49:03,642
Time to care.

902
01:49:05,846 --> 01:49:22,352
Someday... somehow...
will find a new way of living.

903
01:49:26,441 --> 01:49:32,514
We will find a way of forgiving.

904
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:39,316
Somewhere...

905
01:49:51,833 --> 01:49:56,306
...there's a place for us.

906
01:49:56,834 --> 01:50:03,943
A time and a place for us.

907
01:50:06,830 --> 01:50:13,825
Hold my hand and we're half way there.

908
01:50:16,227 --> 01:50:24,143
Hold my hand and I'll take you there.

909
01:50:26,824 --> 01:50:31,817
Somehow...

910
01:50:33,222 --> 01:50:37,010
Someday...

911
01:50:40,820 --> 01:50:43,971
Somewhere...
