All right, Mr. Barstow.

14
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,185
I have the reservation here for
you and Mr. Dickens in room 357...

15
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:00,394
Ooh, Dickens!

16
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:01,979
Thank you.

00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:07,943
Merry Christmas.

20
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:10,255
You've reached the Hotel Fontaine,
your home for the holidays.

21
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,715
This is Georgia speaking.
How may I help you?

22
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,783
You can help me
by coming outside

23
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,910
and giving me a hand
with all of this stuff.

24
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,036
Kiki, great. You're here.

25
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,287
I will be right out.

26
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,044
- Ooh, Georgia!

27
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,605
Florence! Did the
champagne arrive yet?

28
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:29,173
Oh, yes. All 20 cases.

29
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,091
- Great.
- You really got the good stuff, huh?

30
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:32,718
Christmas only
comes once a year.

31
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:33,945
- Yep.
- There you go. Thank you.

32
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,782
[gasps] Oh, uh, that goes outside by
the front door to the right, please.

33
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:38,140
Thank you so much.

34
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,517
- [screams]
- Oops.

35
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,244
- Oh, my God. Thank you, Milton.
- [laughs]

36
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,288
Who knew the Christmas rush
would be so hazardous this year?

37
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:46,774
[gasps] Oh! Oh, uh, the bedside
table lamp in 209 needs a fresh bulb,

38
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,735
414 needs fresh batteries in the
remote, and 327 has a leaky tub.

39
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:51,277
Leaky tub. Yeah,
I'm all over it.

40
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:53,572
- You're the best. Thank you, Milton.
- [phone chimes]

41
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,245
Uh-hmm. Thank you.

42
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,333
Ho, ho, ho, how
about a donation?

43
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,627
Ho, ho, yourself.
How about some help?

44
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,939
Well, if you give me a donation,
I'll give you some help.

45
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,482
Where is your Christmas
spirit, Santa?

46
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,675
Left it up north with
the other reindeer.

47
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,385
I'm so sorry it took so long.

48
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,513
I had no idea how hard it would be
to find a partridge in a pear tree.

49
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:18,931
So, I had to go with the macaw.

50
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,701
As my head concierge, you shouldn't
have to be schlepping all of this,

51
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:24,645
but with my extra holiday time
staff comes in tomorrow, hopefully.

52
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,105
Don't worry about it.

53
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:29,400
What are best friends for, if not
to schlep a little yuletide cheer?

54
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,083
Besides, I should
really be thanking you

55
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,113
for letting me organize this whole
Jingle Mingle party myself this year.

56
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,781
Jingle Mingle, what is that?

57
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:37,843
It's our annual Christmas Eve
party for singles who wanna mingle.

58
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:39,761
[Kiki] And also, for singles
who are not ready to mingle.

59
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,704
Basically, it's a
Christmas party for anyone

60
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,515
who doesn't have something
to do on Christmas Eve.

61
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:44,832
Where's my invitation?

62
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,250
Every party needs a Santa Claus.

63
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,453
Not one on the naughty list.

64
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,187
Hey, I see you when
you're sleeping, you know?

65
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,713
Creepy!

66
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,756
I'm Santa... I'm Santa Claus!

67
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,466
It was a Santa joke!

68
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,510
Just a whiff of
white truffle, chef?

69
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:57,595
Just a whiff.

70
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,644
Et voila!

71
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:08,928
[Victor] You know you go through a lot of
trouble making Georgia lunch every day?

72
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,442
It's not trouble. Besides,
it's not the point.

73
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,985
That is the point.

74
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,195
You've been working here
for over a year now.

75
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,656
And she still doesn't know
how you really feel, does she?

76
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,784
Victor, Georgia and
I are just friends.

77
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:21,911
Good friends.

78
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:24,288
All right, chef.

79
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,498
Just because you and
Anna are sneaking around

80
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:28,000
doesn't mean that we all are.

81
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,503
Uh, we ain't sneaking around. I
mean, you won't tell anybody, right?

82
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:34,757
Look, Anna just wants to keep
it on the down low, all right?

83
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,675
Your secret's safe with me.

84
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:42,640
Oh, hey, Anna. How you doing?

85
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:43,849
Luke, hi!

86
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:45,684
Little last-minute
Christmas shopping?

87
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:47,603
Oh. [chuckles] Yeah, sort of.

88
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,147
If it's for Victor, you better
hide it. He's right in there.

89
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,734
How did you... Victor
doesn't want anyone to know.

90
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,027
Know what?

91
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,367
[sighs]

92
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,250
Oh, my God.

93
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:11,377
Okay.

94
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:15,047
Wow.

95
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,757
Let me guess. Kiki
made the sign.

96
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,716
Her marketing
instincts are great.

97
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:20,681
She's just a little
heavy-handed on the glitter.

98
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,305
At least it is covering the
giant crack in the wall.

99
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:25,224
They say cracks
let the magic in.

100
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,559
[sighs] I'm afraid I
don't believe in magic.

101
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:29,663
- [Luke] Well, do you believe in lunch?
- [Georgia] Oh, my God.

102
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,456
You don't have to keep doing
this for me. You know that.

103
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,607
Hey, making lunch for you
is the highlight of my day.

104
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:37,569
Well, you making lunch for me
is the highlight of my day.

105
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:41,365
So take some time and eat.

106
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:44,576
[sighs] Oh, God.

107
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,079
There's just so much I have to
get done before Christmas Eve.

108
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,848
The lights. The lights on the
fifth floor aren't working.

109
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,624
I forgot to tell
Milton. Oh, my God!

110
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,460
So they can use candles.
It adds mystery.

111
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,965
This rug is ancient.

112
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,088
I have to change this rug!

113
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,135
Not ancient. Vintage.

114
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,824
Does that tree look
crooked to you?

115
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:08,201
[Luke] A little. I think it's
the weight of all the ornaments.

116
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,203
I wanted to get matching ones
this year, I just ran out of time.

117
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:13,063
No, I thought that was the
whole point of our tree.

118
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:14,690
People bring their
own ornaments.

119
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,483
Makes it feel like home.

120
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,778
[chuckles] Hey, not bad.

121
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:22,406
Not bad for a seven-year-old.

122
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,992
I remember it took me a
whole week to make that.

123
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:28,078
I guess I always knew I was
gonna grow up to work with food.

124
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,292
What's the matter? Is it cold?

125
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,045
No, no. It's perfect.

126
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,130
It's just...

127
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,299
I'm so lucky to have you.

128
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,426
You're such a good chef.

129
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,096
You know you could do a lot better
than this old hotel of ours.

130
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,515
I love this old hotel of ours.

131
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:50,308
And the way I look at it,

132
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,227
it's not always the
place that's important.

133
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,688
Sometimes it's the people.

134
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:58,650
[crowd chattering]

135
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,027
Oh, my God! Now what?

136
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,110
Thank you.

137
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,406
Ugh, glitter.

138
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,217
[Jimothy] Hey, enough photos.
Enough photos. Stop with the flash.

139
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,535
No. No, you do not
have a release.

140
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,579
Thank you. Move, move, move.

141
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,207
Not the cameras. Not the cameras,
please. No flash. No flash.

[upbeat music playing]

143
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:19,814
Welcome to the Hotel Fontaine,
your home for the holidays.

144
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,173
[Jimothy] We have a reservation.

145
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,008
Of course. And the name is...

146
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:24,092
Seriously?

147
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,178
This is Pandora.

148
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,701
You probably heard
her last release.

149
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,473
Love, Love, Love is
All Couture to Me.

150
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,058
[Pandora chuckles softly]

151
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,435
Never mind, Jimothy. Nobody did.

152
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,603
That's why we're here.

153
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:37,523
Guru Peterson. That's my
life coach, Guru Peterson.

154
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:42,236
He says I need a simple zen space
to ground myself for the holidays.

155
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,404
Okay.

156
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:46,615
Of course. Here you are. We
have you in a queen room.

157
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:50,034
Avenue view, it's very
simple, very cozy, very zen.

158
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:53,872
Cozy sounds... small.

159
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,042
How about a king?

160
00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,294
Hmm.

00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:00,879
Okay.

Okay. How about the

Ah, there. That should do it.

00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,503
Well, thank you so much, Milton.

178
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:42,880
Oh, you're welcome. [sighs]

179
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,232
Funny thing about this
sink, you know what,

180
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:47,050
that's the third time that faucet
has come loose in the past week.

181
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,469
You'd almost swear somebody
is doing it on purpose.

182
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:52,848
Well, that's crazy. Why would
anybody wanna sabotage my sink?

183
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,058
- Yeah. Weird.
- Weird.

184
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,776
I thought I told
you to stop that.

185
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,695
Checking in.

186
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,281
[Georgia] Of course.
And your name is...

187
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,868
Prince Raymond. Hello.

188
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:16,038
Welcome to the Hotel Fontaine.
It is an honor to have you here.

189
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,916
Thank you. It's just
Raymond though, no Prince.

190
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,334
Right. I knew that.

191
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,211
I just read about you
giving up your title.

192
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:25,047
Yes. And I'm trying to keep a
low profile, you understand?

193
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,966
The Hotel Fontaine is famous
for its discretion with guests.

194
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,261
Instead of two turtle doves, what
if I went with a couple of rabbits?

195
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,096
- Prince Raymond.
- [Georgia] Kiki.

196
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,475
What? This is Prince
Raymond of Caspernia.

197
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,518
Not anymore. He quit.

198
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:42,313
Oh. Well, so then you're not
in town looking for a princess?

199
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,541
Please, forgive my associate.

200
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:46,026
She has inhaled too
much Christmas glitter.

201
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,319
[sighs]

202
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,487
Stop.

203
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:50,656
I'm sorry about him.

204
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,492
He's taken my
abdication rather badly.

205
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,160
He refuses to quit.

206
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,846
I don't even think the earpiece
is attached to anything anymore.

207
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,871
[both chuckles]

208
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,460
So your, um, not Royal Highness?

209
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,337
Just Raymond is fine.

210
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,649
Just Raymond. Is this your
first time visiting in New York?

211
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:09,091
Yes, actually.

212
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:12,028
I want to get as far away from my family
this year for the holidays as possible.

213
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,596
Well, my name is Georgia.
I am the hotel manager.

214
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,848
And if there's anything at
all that I can do for you,

215
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:18,183
please, don't hesitate to ask.

216
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:20,435
Yes, we are all yours.

217
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:23,897
Thank you for your help.

218
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:24,981
No.

219
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,946
Kiki, what was that?

220
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,739
You are not going
to believe this.

221
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:34,616
But I dreamt about
him last night.

222
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,326
This has to be
some kind of sign.

223
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,577
- I mean, look.
- Yes.

224
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,681
It's a sign that you should
stop reading that stuff.

225
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:42,665
There is some kind of
Christmas magic happening here.

226
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,459
The prince and I are
obviously meant to be.

227
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:47,379
Kiki, I hate to break this to you
but there's no such thing as magic.

228
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,441
So how do you explain the prince walking
through the front door of our hotel?

229
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:51,675
[phone chimes]

230
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:56,013
Kiki, will you keep an eye on
the front desk for me, please?

231
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,473
Yes. Wow! Thank you!

232
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:01,101
Kiki, just watch the front desk.

233
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,394
All right? Don't move.

234
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:05,022
Okay. But don't be
surprised if you come back

235
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,983
and I am suddenly Princess Kiki.

236
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,276
[whispers] Okay.

237
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,610
[exhales deeply]

238

[Milton grunts]

240
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,420
I should have this fixed
for you in no time, Georgia.

241
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,339
Get that water
working on 310, too.

242
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,758
Great. Thank you, Milton.

243
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,469
Um, is it possible for you to
maybe come back a little later?

244
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,971
Sure. Yeah, I mean,
you're the boss.

245
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,600
[grunts] Yeah. Everything okay?

246
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:42,768
Yes. Yes.

247
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:43,769
- Totally. Everything's fine.
- Yeah.

248
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,612
Yeah, I have to make a
phone call. That's it.

249
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,247
- [Milton] All right.
- Yeah. Thank you.

250
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,208
Well, yeah, if you need me, you
know where to find me, yeah?

251
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,525
- Sure do!
- [both chuckle]

252
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,069
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

253
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,152
Yeah, thank you.

254
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:54,821
All right. Great. Thanks.

255
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,367
[exhales heavily]

256
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:01,828
[Fontaine] I must say, Georgia.

257
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,289
You present a very
persuasive argument

258
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:08,293
and, uh, the design you sent for
the proposal, they look magnific.

259
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,837
So innovative, so modern.

260
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,506
Thank you, Madame Fontaine.

261
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,007
The problem is...

262
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,718
I hate modern.

263
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:21,723
That's why we keep Hotel
Fontaine to preserve the past,

264
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:23,600
the elegance, the way of life.

265
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,520
Right. But you wouldn't
have to give any of that up.

266
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,648
The Auberge Moderne would
be the Hotel Fontaine's

267
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,776
cool modern counterpart
right here in New York City.

268
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,444
I understand all
of that, Georgia.

269
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:35,904
But, uh...

270
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,073
Oh, merci, Jean Luc.

271
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,159
This sounds like a great
big deal of extra work

272
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:43,912
and I hardly have time to
spend on my yacht as it is.

273
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,622
That's the beauty
of my proposal.

274
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,415
You wouldn't have
to do anything.

275
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,585
I would take on full responsibility
as the executive director

276
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,588
while you continue to
travel as much as you like.

277
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,298
And all I'm asking
for in return is...

278
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,175
Forty-nine percent
of the ownership.

279
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:58,802
I think that's fair.

280
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,470
[laughs]

281
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:04,433
Oh, your ambition reminds me so
much of myself when I was your age.

282
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:07,894
And I must say, you've
done a wonderful job

283
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,730
over the past two years
for me with the hotel.

284
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,986
And I often say you are
the daughter I never had.

285
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,447
Really? Does this
mean you'll do it?

286
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,240
No.

287
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,119
Oh. Uh, okay.

288
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,913
Well, thank you anyway.

289
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,041
And Madame, would you
please not mention this

290
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,960
to any of the staff
here at the hotel?

291
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,379
I wouldn't want them to know
I was thinking about leaving

292
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:36,965
and it might rub
them the wrong way.

293
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,759
Wait, what if...

294
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,013
I invest half?

295
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:44,723
Half?

296
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:48,143
You come up with the rest
and we'll see if we do.

297
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:51,062
Madam Fontaine, you know I don't
have access to that kind of money.

298
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:54,399
Oh, but I know you to be
a very clever young girl.

299
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:57,819
And I suspect that when you
put your mind to something,

300
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:59,821
there is nothing you can't do.

another four days.

going somewhere to think.

always go to think.

Nothing. [sighs]

that didn't work out.

if we don't talk about it?

about it if you don't want to.

hard their whole lives.

to own their own home.

518
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,606
Bonjour. Joyeux Noel.

519
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:44,525
This is the Hotel Fontaine,
your home for the holidays.

520
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:46,110
How may I help you?

521
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:49,071
[crowd murmuring]

522
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,494
- Let's go.
- Oh.

523
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,998
Where's Santa's little helper
going off to this time?

524
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,083
-It's a Christmas secret, Santa!
[bell ringing]

525
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,954
[Pandora] I wonder what he
looks like under the beard?

526
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:07,506
Dickens... Dickens!

527
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:09,424
Dickens!

528
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:12,595
[flowing waltz playing]

529
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:15,348
You don't even have to lift a
finger if you don't want to.

530
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:16,349
You bring the capital.

531
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:19,852
I'll be the executive director, and
we will split the 49% ownership stake.

532
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:23,314
To be honest, I'm not exactly looking
to get into the hotel business.

533
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:24,690
Why not?

534
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:26,025
Okay. Look down there.

535
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,860
Did you know that during
the holiday season,

536
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:32,073
an average of 800,000 people pass
through Rockefeller Center every day?

537
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:35,493
[inhales sharply] You know, my father
built an indoor rink at the palace once.

538
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,776
First time I tried skating,
I broke my ankle. [chuckles]

539
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:42,124
The point is, all of those
people need somewhere to stay.

540
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:45,461
And modern hotels are the fastest growing
segment of the hospitality industry.

541
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,546
I very much appreciate that,

542
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,799
but I don't know why I would
put any roots down here.

543
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,175
I don't know the city at all.

544
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:52,778
And I'm planning to leave
the day after Christmas.

545
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:55,096
Which gives me just enough
time to show you around.

546
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:58,516
- But I...
- Will you at least give it a chance?

547
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,319
Look, if I don't convince
you that this city

548
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:02,311
is a good investment
by Christmas,

549
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,731
you can hop on your jet and fly
off to anywhere else in the world.

550
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:07,400
But...

551
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,819
if you fall in love
with New York...

552
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,237
I must warn you.

553
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,824
I was a prince, so I'm
pretty difficult to impress.

554
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,159
Clearly, you've
never met New York.

555
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,577
Deal?

556
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:21,746
[chuckles softly]

557
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,001
So you've seen my jet?

558
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:33,634
[joyful marketplace chatter]

559
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:41,559
[Kiki] Do you think these like
geese need to actually lay the eggs

560
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,704
or do you think they can kind
of just sit on top of them?

561
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:45,938
I feel like it's gonna
be kind of hard to...

562
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:48,691
[sighs] ...do you remember
how excited you used to get

563
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,318
about Christmas
when you were a kid?

564
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:54,238
Actually, I don't.

565
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:57,742
Wow. Christmas buzzkill.

566
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,285
Come on.

567
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:02,288
[Pandora] Honestly,
there wasn't much time

568
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:04,373
between the dance rehearsals,

569
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:06,751
and singing classes,
and piano lessons.

570
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:09,670
You know, like,
like any normal kid.

571
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:13,049
Well, in that case, we need
to make up for lost time.

572
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,009
We start with the head first.

573
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,555
Oh, no, I can't.

574
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,099
That is nothing but
sugar and baked lard.

575
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:24,769
Yeah, that's basically
what Christmas is.

576
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:28,689
Come on. I know the best hot
chocolate stand in the city.

577
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,192
[chuckles softly]

578
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:32,902
[flustered hubbub]

579
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:33,985
[barking]

580
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:41,619
Hey, buddy. You lost?

581
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,039
Dickens...

582
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,624
Well, it is Christmas.

583
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,210
Okay, Dickens, let's
find out where you live.

584
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:52,421
[Georgia] They say that a million
kids visit this market at Christmas.

585
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:55,925
In fact, over 60 million
tourists visit New York City

586
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,760
- every year, all year round.
- [chuckles]

587
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,888
And you just have this
information at your fingertips?

588
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:06,435
I have been working on this proposal
for a really, really long time.

589
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:09,814
- I have done my research.
- Yes, I can see that.

590
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:14,610
This new hotel isn't just a real
estate investment for you, is it?

591
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,570
No...[exhales deeply] no.

592
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:17,905
It...

593
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,448
it means the world to me.

594
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:23,035
Look, Georgia, I
appreciate your enthusiasm.

595
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:26,956
And New York is obviously a
massive tourist destination.

596
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,207
But... [sighs]

597
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,793
the truth is, I'm just not sure

598
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,676
I'm looking to invest
in a business right now.

599
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:34,880
I see.

600
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:39,718
Do you mean right now, right now or
do you mean right now as in never?

601
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:43,514
You know what? Why don't we
discuss this over dinner?

602
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,307
I would like that.

603
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,702
I've never had dinner
with a real prince before.

604
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,162
Well, then we're even,
I've never had dinner

605
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,205
with a real hotel
manager before.

606
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,355
[Georgia chuckles softly]

607
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:53,065
How about 8:00?

608
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:55,568
And seeing as you're the
authority on all things New York,

609
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:56,878
I'll leave the where
of it up to you.

610
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,529
That is easy.

611
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,614
I just happen to know
the best chef in town.

612
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:03,242
[Luke] A prince?

613
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:04,577
He used to be.

614
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,953
He used to be?

615
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,764
I didn't know you could
"use to be" a prince.

616
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:10,541
The thing is, he doesn't want
anybody to know about it.

617
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:12,460
So we need to eat
somewhere private.

618
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:15,171
There will only be two of us.
Well, three of us, technically,

619
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,047
but I don't think his
bodyguard eats anything

620
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:18,775
but protein shakes and
the occasional cow.

621
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,801
How did you end up having
dinner with this guy?

622
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:24,680
You know, it's kind
of complicated.

623
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,307
Can we just do 8:00, please?

624
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,560
Yes, we sure can.

625
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:31,437
You're the best.
Thank you so much.

626
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,815
- How's the broth, chef?
- Good, chef.

627
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:37,359
Oh, also, remember
he is royalty,

628
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,754
so I need you to make us something
that's really going to impress him.

629
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,530
He's back to being a prince now?

630
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:44,950
No problem, G.

631
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:46,535
Bring him to the roof at 8:00.

632
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:48,954
The roof?

633
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,165
You said private?

634
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,709
Well, yeah but...

635
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,004
Don't worry about a thing, okay?

636
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,131
I am making the best
dinner he's ever had.

637
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:01,967
What would I ever do
without you, Luke?

638
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:03,636
Thank you.

639
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,517
What are you looking at?

640
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:12,686
Come on. We got
dinner to make, chef.

641
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,232
[sighing]

642
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,902
[bell ringing]

643
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,324
We still need to get the inflatable
pool for the swimming swans

644
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:26,742
and, of course, the swans,

645
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,494
so we better get an
early start tomorrow.

646
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,621
I will see you in
the morning at 8:00.

647
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:31,872
[scoffs] Don't be silly.

648
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:34,041
8:00 doesn't come
in the morning.

649
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:37,294
Does it?

650
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:39,255
[Georgia] Kiki,
what are you doing?

651
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,048
- Didn't Milton tell you?
- Tell me what?

652
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:42,567
I put him in charge
of the front desk.

653
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:43,944
I gave him the badge
and everything.

654
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,595
[Georgia] Kiki, I love Milton,
but he already has a job.

655
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:49,098
This hotel will literally
fall apart without him.

656
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,867
He doesn't have time to
be checking in guests.

657
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:53,143
Okay. But he's doing a
great job at the front desk.

658
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:54,853
Kiki, that's not the point.

659
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:57,690
The point is that this isn't how
you're supposed to run a hotel.

660
00:30:57,773 --> 00:31:01,318
Okay, Georgia, you know the
Fontaine isn't like other hotels.

661
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,821
You're right.

662
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:04,905
It isn't.

663
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:06,589
[sighs] I can't wait
to get out of here.

664
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,118
Can't wait to what?

665
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,036
Georgia.

666
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:13,080
Georgia.

667
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:14,999
Georgia, wait.

668
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:16,584
- Are you Kiki?
- Yeah.

669
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,294
Sign here for you geese.

670
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:19,587
Oh.

671
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:23,090
Thank you.

672
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:25,634
[squawks]

673
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:33,601
[swinging Christmas
rock playing]

674
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:39,189
[Luke] Thanks, Milton. I could
never get these things to work...

675
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:42,276
[dreamy music playing]

676
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,402
Wow.

677
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:46,530
Wow.

678
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,390
Do I look okay? You
look more than okay.

679
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,041
You look...

680
00:31:57,124 --> 00:31:59,376
more than okay.

681
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,505
You look... you
look more than okay.

682
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:04,840
Thanks.

683
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,800
I really wanna make
a good impression.

684
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:09,219
Yeah, of course. I mean,
he's a prince, right?

685
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:11,639
It's not like you're having
dinner with some commoner.

686
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:13,557
[chuckles]

687
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:15,059
I'll see you upstairs.

688
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,019
Yeah. Yeah, see you upstairs.

689
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,358
I think it's a bit of a pity
you're not dining together.

690
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:25,736
Yeah. We're just
friends, Milton.

691
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,738
What makes you think
we should be together?

692
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:30,324
Oh, I don't think you
should be together.

693
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:33,952
Everybody thinks you
should be together.

694
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:37,581
[chuckles]

695
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:46,507
[sighs]

696
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,469
Where have you been all day?

697
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:53,263
I went to a Christmas market.

698
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:55,306
Excuse me?

699
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:56,934
I even ate a gingerbread man

700
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:59,770
that I'm almost 100%
certain was not gluten-free.

701
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,190
So why can't I come
up with a new song?

702
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:05,859
Maybe this will inspire you.

703
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,069
Look.

704
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:10,823
I bought you more nice, normal
clothes for you to wear for Christmas.

705
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,616
Oh.

706
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,201
Ho, ho, ho!

707
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:17,746
[sighs] This is a disaster.

708
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,958
If I don't have a new hit
song soon, my career is over.

709
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,627
What am I gonna do? [sighs]

710
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:28,841
[Holiday vibes playing]

711
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:32,593
Hmm...

712
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:36,140
Just, um, put that on my bill.

713
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:39,226
Good evening,
mademoiselle, and monsieur,

714
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:41,562
and monster.

715
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:43,063
Welcome to Restaurant de Luke.

716
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:44,147
Follow me.

717
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:49,820
Prince, sorry, Raymond,

718
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:52,948
allow me to introduce
you to Chef Luke.

719
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,111
Pleasure to meet you, Chef.

720
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,326
And you...

721
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,329
you are welcome here.

722
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:01,665
Welcome. Thank you.

723
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:03,208
Please.

724
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:05,794
- [clears throat]
- Raymond is visiting New York City

725
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:06,879
for the first time, Luke.

726
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,547
- Oh, is he?
- Yeah.

727
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:12,217
And yet it seems as though he's
made himself right at home.

728
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:13,302
[clears throat]

729
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,929
- Well, it's an easy city to love.
- [Georgia chuckles]

730
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:18,074
- Not if it doesn't love you back.
- [Georgia] Chef Luke.

731
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:21,351
I'm sure you have things
to do in the kitchen.

732
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:22,518
Don't let us keep you.

733
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:24,271
Yes. Yes, of course.

734
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,938
Enjoy your wine.

735
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:27,024
Yeah.

736
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,154
Do you know who that is?

737
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,031
- Georgia said he was a prince.
- Yeah.

738
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:36,158
He's also the guy that was
with her this afternoon.

739
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:38,118
What does that matter?

740
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:39,453
They're just having dinner.

741
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:41,413
[stammers] This
isn't just dinner.

742
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,623
Look at this.

743
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:44,081
Okay. Well, whatever it is,

744
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:46,376
the lobster appetizers
are ready to serve.

745
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,021
You want me to fire
up them fillets now?

746
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:49,254
The fillet?

747
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,590
No, no, no, no, no.

748
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:54,034
There's gonna be
a change of menu.

749
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,847
To our partnership.

750
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:00,700
[Prince Raymond] Let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

751
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:02,351
I haven't made my decision yet.

752
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:04,853
Right.

753
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:07,481
My father always says it's
best to discuss business

754
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:08,774
on a full stomach.

755
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,502
One of the few things
we actually agree on.

756
00:35:10,526 --> 00:35:13,529
You know, I would
really appreciate it

757
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:17,616
if we could keep all of
this between the two of us.

758
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:21,411
I'm not ready to tell the
hotel staff about it yet.

759
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:22,704
[chuckles]

760
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,207
We'll keep it between us then.

761
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,167
Your secret is safe with me.

762
00:35:27,251 --> 00:35:28,335
Thank you.

763
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:37,010
It must have been fun
growing up in a palace?

764
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:38,554
Not always.

765
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:42,182
There are very strict
rules, curfews,

766
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:44,643
elocution lessons,
apparel guidelines.

767
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:47,855
You know, I've never worn
sweatpants in my life.

768
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:49,773
- [gasps] Criminal.
- [chuckles]

769
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:51,125
[Georgia] No wonder
you ran away.

770
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,901
I'm aware of how that sounds.

771
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:54,152
No, actually, I...

772
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:55,737
I really, really get it.

773
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,614
When I moved to New York,

774
00:35:57,698 --> 00:36:00,826
it was like the first
independent thing I ever did.

775
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,329
It was like I finally
owned my own life.

776
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:07,014
And now, you want to
own your own hotel.

777
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,919
[Luke] Dinner is served.

778
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:12,087
Oh, fantastic.

779
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,505
I'm obviously famished.

780
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:17,676
[Luke] Tonight's specialty of the
house is an old New York City recipe

781
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:20,637
that's been passed down in
my family for generations.

782
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:23,223
We only use farm to
table ingredients

783
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:27,436
that have been handcrafted with
artisanal attention to detail

784
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,982
and served at a perfect
temperature of 104 degrees.

785
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:33,942
I present to you...

786
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:36,904
- Pizza.
- [Prince Raymond] Pizza.

787
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:39,573
Yes. Well, we also
have a selection

788
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:42,034
of curated toppings.

789
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,996
I would recommend...

790
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,791
the, uh, cracked
pepper, of course,

791
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,501
simpler is always better.

792
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:52,920
Don't you agree?

793
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:57,549
Chef Luke, may I have
a word in private?

794
00:36:57,633 --> 00:36:59,301
- Of course.
- Excuse us.

795
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,097
After everything we spoke
about and you served him pizza?

796
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:06,308
I thought you said you
always liked my pizza, G?

797
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,393
Are you trying to
ruin this for me?

798
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:11,438
This? I... I don't even know what
this is because you won't tell me.

799
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:15,484
I can't, okay? I'm
sorry. Not yet.

800
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,128
It's just... it's
really important to me.

801
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:19,392
Yeah, well, it must be. You
spent the whole day together.

802
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,323
What? How do you know that?

803
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:24,368
Because I saw you.

804
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:27,663
- Are you spying on me?
- [scoffs]

805
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:31,208
Spy... don't try to change
the subject, all right?

806
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,918
I saw him kiss your hand.

807
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,670
He's a prince.
That's what they do.

808
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,255
Besides what difference
does it make to you anyway?

809
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,218
Oh, nothing... none, none.

810
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:42,803
It makes no difference to me.

811
00:37:43,637 --> 00:37:45,430
Raymond. Hi.

812
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:47,933
Sorry. There was an
emergency in the kitchen,

813
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,202
but I will be right
back at the table.

814
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:51,079
Well, you better hurry up.
There's not gonna be any left.

815
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:53,021
I was never allowed to
eat pizza at the palace.

816
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,415
They say it wasn't
fit for a prince.

817
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,358
But this, Chef Luke. Hmm.

818
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:58,068
This is incredible.

819
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,028
This is one of the
most delicious meals

820
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:02,781
I think I've ever tasted
in my life, so bravo.

821
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,158
Uh, thank you. Thanks.

822
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:07,922
[Prince Raymond] If this is any
indication of New York City cuisine,

823
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:09,246
might've stick around after all.

824
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:14,584
I have to get back to the table.

825
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:16,920
My pizza's getting cold.

826
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:19,548
G. [sighs]

827
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:25,679
Sorry, brother.

828
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:26,763
Come on.

829
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:28,181
- Let's go.
- [Luke sighs]

830
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,936
No, it's okay.

831
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,229
Yeah. I love you.

832
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:44,156
Everything okay, Flo?

833
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,867
Yeah. Oh, yeah,
everything's fine.

834
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,954
Just my son and my daughter-in-law
aren't gonna be able to make it in

835
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:53,165
for Christmas dinner
after all, so...

836
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,374
I'm sorry.

837
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:58,795
Yeah. Which leaves me with a whole
lot of turkey for one person.

838
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:00,130
- [chuckles]
- [Milton chuckles]

839
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:02,674
So you done for the night?

840
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:08,638
Yeah. Uh, pretty cold out there, so I sure
am glad I have this beautiful new scarf.

841
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:11,349
[Florence] Oh, yeah. Well,
it's very becoming on you.

842
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:12,433
[laughs] Oh, thank you.

843
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:15,520
[sighs]

844
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:19,566
Well, good night, Milton.

845
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:22,527
Well, have a good night, Flo.

846
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:28,575
Good night, Anna.

847
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:30,077
Good night.

848
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:45,383
Oh...

849
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,053
Oh, no.

850
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,555
My gift for Victor...

851
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:56,436
[solemn guitar playing]

852
00:39:57,354 --> 00:40:01,316
[Prince Raymond] You know, I don't
think your Chef Luke like me very much.

853
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:04,277
No. I wouldn't
say that. [laughs]

854
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:06,863
Luke is just passionate.

855
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:09,032
You know how chefs are.

856
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:10,909
So you've known him
for a long time then?

857
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:16,581
I've been friends with
Luke for a very long time.

858
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,418
I can't even imagine
the hotel without him.

859
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:22,963
Just friends?

860
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,137
Oh, my gosh. I love
that window. [chuckles]

861
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,432
[toy train whistling]

862
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,102
[giggling]

863
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:40,438
You know, I heard that there are
over eight million mechanical elves

864
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:41,874
in New York City

[Prince Raymond] You're not the only one

867

[Georgia] I am just trying to help
you make a sound business decision

868
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:48,822
based on facts and logic.

869
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:52,742
The truth is, I haven't made
many big decisions in my life.

870
00:40:53,577 --> 00:40:58,623
My last one, abdicating the throne,
wasn't based in logic at all.

871
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:01,877
I guess that's going to be
true of my next decision, too.

872
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,297
Are you serious?

873
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,424
[chuckles] Very.

874
00:41:08,425 --> 00:41:09,843
I looked at your proposal.

875
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,928
I think you'd be a
great business partner.

876
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,804
You're not kidding, right?
He's not kidding, right?

877
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:16,224
No.

878
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:17,726
Not kidding.

Oh, my God. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

- [Prince Raymond] Careful.

881
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:23,523
You know, there are
paparazzis hiding.

00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:25,901
We don't want anyone
to get the wrong idea.

883
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,235
Sorry.

884

This is going to be the
best Christmas ever.

886

[Georgia] So the Prince has
agreed to invest half the cost

887
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:45,337
But I heard that Prince
Raymond has left the throne,

888
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,048
didn't want to be a part of
the royal family anymore.

00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:50,091
Silly boy.

890
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:53,261
Well, yes, but he is looking
to expand his interests.

891
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:56,014
The thing is, he is leaving New
York right after Christmas, so...

892
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:57,265
So in that case,

893
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:58,934
I suggest...

894
00:41:59,643 --> 00:42:02,395
Jean-Luc, I'm thirsty.

895
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:04,981
Yes. What do you suggest?

896
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:08,401
[Madame] I suggest you
open a bottle of Champagne.

897
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:10,779
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

898
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,662
Thank you, Madame Fontaine.
Thank you so much.

Oh, don't thank me.

00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:40,627
Oh...

1036
00:48:43,463 --> 00:48:45,423
He's even got good
taste in clothes.

1037
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:55,350
[Kiki] I just can't believe
Georgia wouldn't tell me

1038
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,226
she's planning to
leave the hotel.

1039
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,771
Maybe she wanted to
keep it a secret.

1040
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:02,649
People keep secrets from each
other all the time, right?

1041
00:49:02,732 --> 00:49:05,109
Even when they're supposed
to be best friends?

1042
00:49:05,193 --> 00:49:06,235
I don't know.

1043
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,821
I never really had
time for a best friend.

1044
00:49:08,905 --> 00:49:11,783
Well, I am in the market for a
new one, if you're interested.

1045
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:12,867
Thanks.

1046
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,827
Come on. You're gonna
help me with these.

1047
00:49:16,913 --> 00:49:19,457
Um, what am I supposed to do?

1048
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,518
Oh, we're gonna
decorate the cookies

1049
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:23,270
and then put them on the
tree for the Jingle Mingle.

1050
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,505
Oh, no, no, no. I better not.

1051
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:27,924
Why not? It's
Christmas tradition.

1052
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:31,469
But what if I don't do it right?

1053
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:33,262
What if my cookies
are a huge flop

1054
00:49:33,346 --> 00:49:36,391
and nobody likes them and I never
have another hit cookie again?

1055
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,768
Who cares if no one
likes your cookies?

1056
00:49:40,103 --> 00:49:43,147
Listen, some people
don't like gingerbread.

1057
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:44,816
Some people don't
like shortbread.

1058
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:47,318
Some people don't even
like cookies at all.

1059
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:49,904
So you really can't worry what
other people are gonna think.

1060
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,783
Sometimes, you just gotta
make the cookies for yourself.

1061
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:56,327
Get to work.

1062
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:57,912
Oh.

1063
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:06,105
[Prince Raymond] You know, when
I said I wanted to see New York,

1064
00:50:06,129 --> 00:50:07,880
I didn't mean to see
it all in one day.

1065
00:50:07,964 --> 00:50:10,758
So far, we've seen a property
that look like a prison.

1066
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:12,885
One, like a subterranean bunker,

1067
00:50:12,969 --> 00:50:14,449
and there was that
hole in the ground

1068
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,115
that I was actually
beginning to consider

1069
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:18,182
until we were attacked
by feral pigeons.

1070
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:21,769
I have to admit so far, Georgia,
this isn't very encouraging.

1071
00:50:21,853 --> 00:50:22,895
No, I know. Okay.

1072
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:25,231
Just... just wait
until you see this one.

1073
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,321
Do you have a key?

1074
00:50:32,405 --> 00:50:33,406
Better.

1075
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:34,866
I have an app.

1076
00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:42,206
[Georgia] Look at this place.

1077
00:50:42,457 --> 00:50:44,459
The realtor is starting
to stage it for Christmas.

1078
00:50:46,002 --> 00:50:48,588
- Oh, this is...
- Beautiful.

1079
00:50:50,757 --> 00:50:52,550
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

1080
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,220
Look at that.

1081
00:50:56,304 --> 00:50:59,474
That, now, that is
a Christmas tree.

1082
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:01,017
Now, this...

1083
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,936
This is a proper
restaurant for our hotel.

1084
00:51:06,189 --> 00:51:11,110
The Viridian is the hotel's five-star
award-winning dining experience.

1085
00:51:11,194 --> 00:51:13,821
I know just the chef
to do it justice.

1086
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:15,573
Chef Luke.

1087
00:51:16,616 --> 00:51:17,658
Chef Luke?

1088
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,328
Erm... [chuckles]

1089
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:22,997
He's great at making pizza.

1090
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:27,001
I was thinking more along the
lines of Otto Hans Becker.

1091
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:29,212
Has a Michelin star

1092
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:31,295
and he's the spoke chef to
World Hunger Foundation.

1093
00:51:31,339 --> 00:51:33,216
[Georgia] Chef Luke
likes to help people too.

1094
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:36,886
Look, Georgia. I know that
he's your friend, but...

1095
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:40,973
Our new hotel will need someone
with reputation. Gravitas.

1096
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:45,686
Luke just isn't that.

1097
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:52,568
[discouraged music playing]

1098
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:03,246
So partner, what do you think?

1099
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:06,499
I think we found our hotel.

1100
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:19,636
Hey.

1101
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:28,271
Hi. Excuse me.

1102
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:30,231
I was wondering if
you had matching boots

1103
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:32,024
to go with this jack... et.

1104
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:35,026
Hi.

1105
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:37,237
Hey.

1106
00:52:37,697 --> 00:52:38,739
You work here?

1107
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:40,241
Actually, I own the place,

1108
00:52:40,992 --> 00:52:43,911
and another uptown and
one at the airport.

1109

Got 'em in the
divorce. [chuckles]

1110

How do you own pet
stores but not a dog?

1111
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:51,419
I do.

- No.

I actually have something
I wanna ask you.

1119
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,021
I would...

1120
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:15,943
I would really like to go to the
Jingle Mingle at the hotel with you.

1121
00:53:16,027 --> 00:53:18,863
And that is if you
still wanted to go.

1122
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:23,868
Hmm, do I wanna go to the
Jingle Mingle with you?

1123
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,828

it. Yes, I do.

Nothing. It's just, um,

I've only been single for
about six months, you know?

1128

And I still get a little...
skittish with, you know, this.

1129

Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

I've had about two
years, and I still squirm

for my phone number.

What do you think?

00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:40,249
Doesn't matter how much
glitter you throw around.

1206
00:57:42,293 --> 00:57:44,378
There really is no
such thing as magic.

1207
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:53,846
[exhales sharply]

1208
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:55,931
[indistinct chatter]

1209
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:57,516
[clears throat]

1210
00:58:01,187 --> 00:58:03,165
Well, the guests should be
arriving in a couple of hours.

1211
00:58:03,189 --> 00:58:04,565
Flo, anything I
can help you with?

1212
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:06,609
Oh. Actually, there is.

1213
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:07,902
Have a seat, Milton.

1214
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:10,029
Oh, all righty...

1215
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:12,656
So, with it being
Christmas Eve and all,

1216
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:15,868
and you and I being
friends all these years.

1217
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:18,621
I thought, well... I... uh-hmm.

1218
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,665
- For me?
- Yeah. Well, read the tag.

1219
00:58:21,749 --> 00:58:23,167
Oh.

1220
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,669
- Yeah, that's me. [laughs]
- [chuckles]

1221
00:58:25,753 --> 00:58:27,254
Okay. Go ahead.
Open it already.

1222
00:58:27,338 --> 00:58:28,589
Okay. Sure. Sure.

1223
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:31,508
Well, this is... Oh,
it's sweet of you.

1224
00:58:34,637 --> 00:58:37,097
Oh, Flo.

1225
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:39,117
Well, you know, you looked
really good in the red one,

1226
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:41,936
but I just thought that this
went with your eyes better.

1227
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:44,104
Hmm.

1228
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:46,023
Ah. Great.

1229
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:47,441
Thank you.

1230
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,235
But I didn't get you anything.

1231
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:51,403
Oh, well, I've already
thought about that.

1232
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:54,698
Remember I told you that my
son and my daughter-in-law

1233
00:58:54,782 --> 00:58:56,575
can't make it this Christmas?

1234
00:58:56,659 --> 00:59:00,829
So, I was wondering if you
would like to come to my place

1235
00:59:00,913 --> 00:59:03,916
and help me eat all that
goldarn turkey that I bought.

1236
00:59:05,334 --> 00:59:08,337
Flo, I would like
that very much.

1237
00:59:10,923 --> 00:59:12,925
- [chuckles]
- Great.

1238
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:15,719
I need to get back
for the mingle, soon.

1239
00:59:15,803 --> 00:59:18,681
But I really want to show you
my idea for the lobby first.

1240
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:23,185
So I'm thinking we redo this
whole reception area here.

1241
00:59:23,269 --> 00:59:24,311
Oh, shoot.

1242
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:26,188
Madame Fontaine, I
forgot to charge my phone

1243
00:59:26,272 --> 00:59:29,024
so I might lose you,
but what do you think?

1244
00:59:29,108 --> 00:59:30,901
Whatever you like, Georgia.

1245
00:59:30,985 --> 00:59:33,904
Okay. Great.

1246
00:59:33,988 --> 00:59:35,739
Are you sure you don't
wanna ask Jean-Luc?

1247
00:59:35,823 --> 00:59:36,991
Jean-Luc is not here.

1248
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:41,620
He's found a more
amusing way to vacation.

1249
00:59:47,876 --> 00:59:50,296
There's got to be charger
in here somewhere.

1250
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:53,841
Of course.

1251
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,384
[exhales sharply] Oh, the party.

1252
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:01,598
[groans]

1253
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:07,354
What? Oh, the app.

1254
01:00:09,481 --> 01:00:12,318
Oh, my God. No,
no, no, no, no.

1255
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,488
Hello?

1256
01:00:16,572 --> 01:00:19,033
[mouthed] Can anybody
hear me? Hello?

1257
01:00:20,701 --> 01:00:21,910
Help!

1258
01:00:21,994 --> 01:00:22,995
Hello?

1259
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:27,875
[indifferent city bustle]

1260
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:38,844
[Christmas party music playing]

1261
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,306
[Kiki] Has anyone seen Georgia?

1262
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:44,350
I've been calling her
for like the last hour

1263
01:00:44,433 --> 01:00:46,268
and it just keeps
going to voicemail.

1264
01:00:47,436 --> 01:00:48,937
What about the milkmaids?

1265
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:52,191
Them too?

1266
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:54,735
Great. That is just great.

1267
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:58,364
[laughs] If it isn't
Little Miss Edwina Scrooge.

1268
01:00:58,447 --> 01:01:00,991
You know what? Not
tonight, Santa, okay?

1269
01:01:01,075 --> 01:01:04,119
I've got no pipers,
my drummers cancelled,

1270
01:01:04,203 --> 01:01:07,039
and my lords 'a' leaping are
stuck on the train from Brooklyn,

1271
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:08,892
along with the rest of
the 12 Days of Christmas.

1272
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:09,917
I don't even have a...

1273
01:01:11,919 --> 01:01:13,545
Hey, Santa.

1274
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:19,093
How'd you like to go to a party?

1275
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:21,220
Thought you'd never ask.

1276
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:24,765
[upbeat music playing]

1277
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:34,108
Well, Merry Christmas.

1278
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:37,861
Are we, uh, single or
not yet ready to mingle?

1279
01:01:38,654 --> 01:01:40,948
Um, single I guess.

1280
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:43,200
[chuckles] Single,
it is. Enjoy.

1281
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:45,369
Thank you.

1282
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:48,705
Stop fidgeting.
You look just fine.

1283
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:52,584
Now, this is a nice, normal party
full of nice, normal people.

1284
01:01:52,668 --> 01:01:55,504
[gasps] Thank you.

1285
01:01:55,587 --> 01:02:00,426
This is going to be just
the inspiration you need.

1286
01:02:00,509 --> 01:02:01,509
[glasses clink]

1287
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:06,515
Something's wrong. I know it.

1288
01:02:06,598 --> 01:02:08,016
This isn't like her.

1289
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,018
Perhaps, she changed
her mind about coming.

1290
01:02:10,102 --> 01:02:11,228
Georgia wouldn't do that.

1291
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:12,872
This party was her idea
in the first place.

1292
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:14,273
She loves the Jingle Mingle.

1293
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:17,317
Well, maybe she doesn't
love it anymore.

1294
01:02:22,448 --> 01:02:24,551
[Prince Raymond] Listen, I
think I know where Georgia is.

1295
01:02:24,575 --> 01:02:26,994
- [knocking]
- [Georgia] Help.

1296
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:28,370
Please, help me.

1297
01:02:28,454 --> 01:02:30,205
Hello? Hi. Hi.

1298
01:02:30,289 --> 01:02:32,666
[silence]

1299
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:34,877
Help, please. Help
me get out, please.

1300
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,671
[silence]

1301
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,631
[groans]

1302
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:43,385
[sighs]

1303
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:49,183
[party swing playing]

1304
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:54,414
[man] I own a
frozen yogurt store

1305
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:56,273
and our signature
flavor is vanilla.

1306
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:59,377
In my free time, I collect vintage khakis,
you know, from different eras in history.

1307
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:02,279
Some people believe that
khaki originated in 1930s,

1308
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:05,824
but you can actually trace the
origin of the pants to the 1840s.

1309
01:03:05,908 --> 01:03:07,784
[chuckles]

1310
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:09,453
Excuse me.

1311
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:17,669
[sniffs] [sighs]

1312
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:21,548
If this is normal, I quit.

1313
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:41,234
[sighs]

1314
01:03:44,613 --> 01:03:46,031
Look, I'm sorry.

1315
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:48,617
I'm just not ready
to do this yet.

1316
01:03:49,368 --> 01:03:50,368
Sorry, sir?

1317
01:03:51,078 --> 01:03:53,413
Oh, just talking to the dog.

1318
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:55,207
Oh.

1319
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:57,167
Well, that's everything then.

1320
01:03:57,251 --> 01:04:00,003
You're not joining everyone
for the Jingle Mingle tonight?

1321
01:04:00,087 --> 01:04:01,171
No, I'm not.

1322
01:04:01,255 --> 01:04:04,049
Besides, what's so great
about mingling, anyway?

1323
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:05,884
[barking]

1324
01:04:05,968 --> 01:04:08,595
Dickens! Dickens!

1325
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:11,723
[excited barking]

1326
01:04:14,101 --> 01:04:15,644
Dickens!

1327
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:17,479
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1328
01:04:17,563 --> 01:04:20,315
[panting]

1329
01:04:26,113 --> 01:04:27,281
[elevator dings]

1330
01:04:32,286 --> 01:04:33,787
"Good girll pose," Amazing.

1331
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,550
Perfect. Those are some
real Santa selfies.

1332
01:04:35,581 --> 01:04:37,517
You know where to find me
afterwards if it gets too cold.

1333
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:40,294
Oh, speaking of...
Thank you. Thank you.

1334
01:04:40,961 --> 01:04:42,963
Santas are supposed to be
having milk and cookies.

1335
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:44,881
Yeah, but this Santa
wants champagne

1336
01:04:44,965 --> 01:04:46,734
because I've been working
incredibly hard for this.

1337
01:04:46,758 --> 01:04:48,678
- I'm not dropping it.
- [Kiki] Drop it! Drop it!

1338
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:52,139
- [thuds]
- [sparks]

1339
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:54,266

[barking]

1343
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:03,317
Just look at what
you did, Santa.

1344
01:05:05,277 --> 01:05:06,778
Santa!

1345
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:10,490
Dickens!

1346
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:14,828
Hi.

1347
01:05:16,288 --> 01:05:17,581
Going somewhere?

1348
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:20,250
Um...

1349
01:05:23,337 --> 01:05:25,797
I'll, uh, I'll go check the
fuses, you keep them calm.

1350
01:05:25,881 --> 01:05:27,591
- [clears throat]
- What? What?!

1351
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:31,386
Hey, everyone.

1352
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:33,388
Wow. [laughs]

1353
01:05:33,472 --> 01:05:38,018
What a Christmas surprise! I
should ask Santa for new wiring!

1354
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:41,104
[dramatic music playing]

1355
01:05:51,031 --> 01:05:53,533
[Luke] No, I thought that was
the whole point of our tree?

1356
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:55,410
People bring their
own ornaments.

1357
01:05:55,494 --> 01:05:58,705
Makes it feel more like
home. Look at that.

1358
01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:00,457
Not bad for a seven-year-old.

1359
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:04,211
Hey, making lunch for you
is the highlight of my day.

1360
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:06,880
[Kiki] It doesn't matter how
much glitter you throw around.

1361
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,132
There really is no
such thing as magic.

1362
01:06:09,216 --> 01:06:12,678
[dramatic music playing]

1363
01:06:16,515 --> 01:06:18,100
[groaning]

1364
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:32,197
[knocking]

1365
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:40,622
Oh, my God. [chuckling] Yes.

1366
01:06:40,706 --> 01:06:42,916
Hi. Hi. Yes. Thank
you. Thank you.

1367
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:46,002
Hi. Oh, my God. Um, uh,
can you get the app?

1368
01:06:46,086 --> 01:06:48,088
[silence]

1369
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:51,299
You need to get an app for
the building to open the door.

1370
01:06:56,847 --> 01:06:57,848
There's that.

1371
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:04,771
[Kiki] All right, everyone. Lights
will be back on in just a minute.

1372
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:08,066
Have some more champagne, right?

1373
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:10,485
Luke. Everybody's leaving.

1374
01:07:10,569 --> 01:07:12,489
Can you get them to play
some music or something?

1375
01:07:12,571 --> 01:07:14,698
With what? The
power is still out.

1376
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:16,867
My party-giving reputation
is going to be over

1377

1378
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,420
I'm sorry.

1379
01:07:28,503 --> 01:07:31,173
I really thought I
could do this, but...

1380
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:33,884
Hey. Breakups are hard.

1381
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:35,719
You know?

1382
01:07:35,802 --> 01:07:37,522
But you can't let it
define your whole life.

1383
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:40,515
So how do you get past it?

1384
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:42,350
Maybe you don't.

1385
01:07:43,477 --> 01:07:46,563
Maybe you just go through it.

1386
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:49,191
Sounds easier than it feels.

take to get the power back on?

01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,718
Beats me. Some things
just take time, you know?

1391
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:24,100
Victor, I thought you
didn't want anyone to know?

I thought you didn't
want anyone to know.

Come here.

as important as belonging.

alone at Christmas and why?

flight and tell you something in person.

Director of the Hotel Fontaine.

little incentive.

1534
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:09,065

- I just think that

extra at Christmas.

you about a raise after the holidays.

at the Hotel Fontaine?

1544

There is no events and
marketing position.

There is now.

1546

That is, if you'll forgive me.

course I forgive you.

Actually, Milton, why
don't you keep it?

1556
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:11,627
No, no, no, I, I couldn't.
I'm not the, uh...

You do?
