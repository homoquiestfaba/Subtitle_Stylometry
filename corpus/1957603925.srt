00:01:06,124 --> 00:01:10,086
[Walt exhales]
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

3
00:01:10,169 --> 00:01:13,464
Hi, I'm Walt and this is
my official application

4
00:01:13,548 --> 00:01:17,385
for the Kovi Industries
Student Mars Program.

5
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:19,971
Not that the last 36
applications weren't official,

6
00:01:20,054 --> 00:01:21,848
it's just this is
my final one.

7
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:25,768
because they are actually
making me graduate
after this semester,

8
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:27,520
so... Okay.

9
00:01:27,604 --> 00:01:31,774
<i>I was raised by a single mom.</i>
<i>She had, like, 100 careers.</i>

10
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:34,903
<i>We moved around like crazy,</i>
<i>so I never really had</i>
<i>a home base.</i>

11
00:01:34,986 --> 00:01:37,280
<i>But one time</i>
<i>when I was, like, six,</i>

12
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:39,574
<i>she took me to see</i>
<i>this solar eclipse</i>

13
00:01:39,657 --> 00:01:42,911
and from that moment on
all I wanted to do
was go to the Sun.

14
00:01:42,994 --> 00:01:46,873
And I know that you can't
actually go to the Sun.

15
00:01:46,956 --> 00:01:51,753
My mom would try to tell me
that, but I would
just stare at it.

16
00:01:51,836 --> 00:01:53,630
Uh, and I was obsessed.

17
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:56,132
<i>Because there was more</i>
<i>out there than the new town,</i>

18
00:01:56,215 --> 00:01:59,218
<i>or the new school which always</i>
<i>felt like the same town</i>
<i>and the same school</i>

19
00:01:59,302 --> 00:02:00,970
and I think if I could've
gotten the chance to just

20
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:04,265
go up there and look back
I would've seen...

21
00:02:06,017 --> 00:02:10,188
where I fit in,
in this crazy universe.

22
00:02:10,271 --> 00:02:14,859
<i>Exploration is the way</i>
<i>that we discover where</i>
<i>we truly belong</i>

23
00:02:14,943 --> 00:02:19,489
and I just...
I don't belong here.

24
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:23,326
Which is all to say
that I think I would be
a perfect fit

25
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:27,664
for the Geological Survey Team,
or Propulsions Analysis
Department.

26
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:31,209
Botany and Terraformation Crew,
Security Detail, Rover Repair.

27
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:35,213
Look, if you need someone
to make you coffees,
I'm your guy.

28
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:40,218
I am your guy.

29
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,223
That's it.

30
00:02:45,306 --> 00:02:47,558
Um... Okay.

31
00:02:47,642 --> 00:02:48,935
Well, with any luck,

32
00:02:49,018 --> 00:02:51,187
the next time you see me

33
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,107
uh, I will be on Mars.

34
00:02:58,861 --> 00:03:02,156
[Leon]<i> Let's face it.</i>
<i>This planet isn't</i>
<i>cutting it anymore.</i>

35
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,118
<i>I'm self-made billionaire,</i>
<i>Leon Kovi</i>

36
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:08,287
<i>and I cannot wait</i>
<i>to meet you on Mars.</i>

37
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:13,251
[Gary] Walt! Oat milk latte.
Light foam.

38
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:15,128
Oat milk latte. Light foam.

39
00:03:15,211 --> 00:03:18,089
[Gary] This obsession with Mars
is borderline unhealthy

40
00:03:18,172 --> 00:03:21,259
and you are on the wrong side
of that border.

41
00:03:21,342 --> 00:03:22,510
Exactly.

42
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:24,470
Should I fire you,
so you can go there?

43
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:28,808
Let's do it, Walt.
I'll fire you.
It truly would be my pleasure.

44
00:03:28,891 --> 00:03:31,102
No, Gary. I love it here.

45
00:03:31,185 --> 00:03:32,645
[Gary] Maybe tomorrow.

46
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:35,440
-[woman] Oat milk latte?
-Light... foam?

47
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,528
-Gary?
-[Gary] Yes, Walt?

48
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:41,904
Did she just smile at me?

49
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:45,241
[Gary] Honestly, I'd say
she smiled past you.

50
00:03:45,324 --> 00:03:47,702
-Analysis.
-There is a 52% chance

51
00:03:47,785 --> 00:03:49,454
of romantic interest.

52
00:03:49,537 --> 00:03:53,499
But a 48% chance she pities you
due to your low status position

53
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,126
as an assistant barista

54
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:58,129
to a robot
on a university campus.

55
00:03:58,212 --> 00:03:59,630
Shall I continue?

56
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,232
I honestly feel like I'm gonna
get accepted this time.

57
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,069
You're projecting.

58
00:04:21,152 --> 00:04:22,987
So what?

59
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:26,365
Leon Kovi was 25 when he became
the very first man
to set foot on Mars.

60
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:28,284
And here we are, just settling

61
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:31,788
for the same classes and jobs
and parties that our parents
went to,

62
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,832
and their parents went to
before them and their parents
went to before them--

63
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,459
So you're not coming to
the party?

64
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,461
-Of course,
I'm coming to the party.
-Great. Come on.

65
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,463
-You're carrying the booze.
-[Walt] No, come on.

66
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,507
-We're gonna forget about it
and I'm gonna take it to work.
-Walt,

67
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,550
I'm gonna need you to
keep the whole

68
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:46,386
Walt-ing thing
in check tonight.

69
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:48,179
-"Walt-ing"?
-Bummer monologues.

70
00:04:48,262 --> 00:04:51,057
-Leon Kovi hero worship.
-It's not hero worship.

71
00:04:53,142 --> 00:04:56,813
-That came with
the application packet.
-Not the frame.

72
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,358
Don't you wanna be
part of something special?

73
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,445
Walt.

74
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:06,405
You're not special.

75
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:08,491
I'm not special.

76
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,743
Most people, not special.

77
00:05:10,827 --> 00:05:13,079
Listen, someday,
you're gonna meet someone

78
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:15,248
and make something special
with them.

79
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:16,499
Like a memory.

80
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,960
Or a weird, well, baby thing.

81
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:21,921
But until then,

82
00:05:22,004 --> 00:05:25,758
drink this and for the love
of God do not bring up Mars.

83
00:05:25,842 --> 00:05:28,136
-[club music playing]
-This place is nuts.

84
00:05:28,219 --> 00:05:29,720
Do you live here?

85
00:05:29,804 --> 00:05:31,722
Oh, no. Some trust fund girl.

86
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:34,684
[scoffs]

87
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,853
You know, when I was little,
I had this fantasy
that my mom--

88
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:38,813
Ooh, let's not.

89
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:40,356
Yeah.

90
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,276
Bathroom?

91
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,615
It's beautiful.

92
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:51,367
[orb] Hi, Sophie.

93
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,994
Okay, show me yours.

94
00:05:53,077 --> 00:05:54,579
[orb]<i> Hi, Calvin.</i>

95
00:05:54,662 --> 00:05:56,539
<i>Hi, human Sophie.</i>

96
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,708
<i>Nine months.</i>

97
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,919
<i>Nine months until</i>
<i>my parents' contract is up</i>

98
00:06:02,003 --> 00:06:03,963
<i>and we return to Earth.</i>

99
00:06:04,046 --> 00:06:07,508
<i>Nine more months</i>
<i>without touching you.</i>

100
00:06:07,592 --> 00:06:11,679
<i>At least this way, you will</i>
<i>know when I want to touch you</i>

101
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:13,556
<i>and vice versa.</i>

102
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,975
Well, I hope touching me
is a lot more fun than touching
one of these.

103
00:06:16,058 --> 00:06:18,227
<i>No, no, no, it is.</i>
<i>The texture's for, like...</i>

104
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,229
<i>Can you guys please stop</i>
<i>talking about touching</i>
<i>each other in here?</i>

105
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,064
-Hi, Brandon.
-[Brandon]<i> Hi, Sophie.</i>

106
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,525
<i>Jan, can you get Brandon</i>
<i>out of here?</i>

107
00:06:24,609 --> 00:06:28,029
-[Brandon]<i> Will you stop</i>
<i>calling her Jan? It's "Mom."</i>
<i>-Jan, get your idiot son out!</i>

108
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:34,744
[Brandon]<i> Why would you grab</i>
<i>my butt? Now the hole.</i>

109
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:38,414
[Calvin]<i> Dude,</i>
<i>way too much, dawg!</i>
<i>Get out of here.</i>

110
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:41,959
-Is that on Mars?
-Oh! What are you doing?
Get out!

111
00:06:42,043 --> 00:06:43,377
Just looking for the bathroom.

112
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:45,421
Who walks into bathrooms
without knocking?

113
00:06:45,504 --> 00:06:47,423
Walt. Is this live?

114
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:49,217
How did they solve
for the time delay?

115
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,052
<i>It's called quantum splicing.</i>

116
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,095
Don't talk to him.
I don't know this man.

117
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,805
-Could we exchange emails
or something?
-[Sophie] No!

118
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:57,141
-Mine's just "Walt"
five times at...
-[gasps]

119
00:07:00,144 --> 00:07:01,646
I'm sorry. I can replace it.

120
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:03,397
Unless it's expensive.

121
00:07:03,481 --> 00:07:05,066
-Get out.
-Right now?

122
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:06,776
[Sophie] Yes, right now!

123
00:07:09,278 --> 00:07:11,447
Sorry. Jules tricked me
into throwing a party.

124
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,116
-[Jan]<i> And yet</i>
<i>you're in your room.</i>
-Uh, nope.

125
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,204
It's not really a party.
It's more of a soiree.

126
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:19,789
[Jan]<i> Sophie, it's fine.</i>

127
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,749
<i>I'm late for work. Love you.</i>

128
00:07:21,832 --> 00:07:23,918
-Love you.
-[Calvin]<i> Love you, Mom.</i>

129
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:27,129
<i>Go. Mingle. We'll be back soon.</i>

130
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,591
<i>And in the meantime, it might</i>
<i>be good for you to have</i>
<i>some new experiences.</i>

131
00:07:30,675 --> 00:07:33,636
Nothing's more overrated
than new.

132
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,680
<i>There's a title</i>
<i>for your thesis.</i>

133
00:07:37,515 --> 00:07:38,766
<i>Sophie,</i>

134
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,226
<i>go.</i>

135
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:41,769
<i>I'll make sure Calvin</i>
<i>calls you tomorrow.</i>

136
00:07:43,854 --> 00:07:45,815
-Night, Jan.
<i>-Goodnight.</i>

137
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,837
You know, I've been at this
school for three years.

138
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,964
Always said that I'd explore
these woods.

139
00:08:11,382 --> 00:08:13,759
Never have. Guess I thought
that I would just...

140
00:08:13,843 --> 00:08:16,053
[slurring] I've been going
to this school
for five years.

141
00:08:16,137 --> 00:08:18,764
-Oh, five years, okay.
-[burps]

142
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:22,518
And I always said I'd explore
these woods too.

143
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:26,272
But know what?
Somebody already did.

144
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:29,191
A long, long time ago.

145
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,609
It's over.

146
00:08:30,693 --> 00:08:32,903
There's nothing left
to discover.

147
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:36,240
You're okay, man.

148
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:38,951
You're a good listener.

149
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:40,536
[Ginny laughs]

150
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,706
I'm sorry.

151
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,208
I've never seen light flirting
take such a dark turn.

152
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,835
Basically my superpower.

153
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:50,296
Just one brief conversation
with me will

154
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:53,382
really leave you
questioning everything.

155
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,177
Not the hero we need, but maybe
the one we deserve.

156
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,929
You know, in about 14 seconds
you're going to get
the sudden urge to jump.

157
00:08:59,013 --> 00:09:00,723
Oh, no. You're safe.

158
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:04,727
I'm already in the midst
of an existential crisis.

159
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,771
Oh, well. In that case,

160
00:09:06,854 --> 00:09:08,397
Walt, at your service.

161
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,316
-Ginny.
-Ginny?

162
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,568
Yeah, the, uh,

163
00:09:12,651 --> 00:09:14,236
astrophysics major?

164
00:09:15,738 --> 00:09:18,240
How did you know that?

165
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:21,160
I was in your Intro to
Fluid Dynamics class.

166
00:09:21,243 --> 00:09:23,037
Freshmen year.

167
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,122
This is the part where
you at least pretend
to remember me.

168
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:28,959
-Oh, my God! Walt! Wow.
-Yeah, thank you. Thank you.

169
00:09:29,043 --> 00:09:30,419
Changed your major?

170
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,712
Sixteen times.

171
00:09:31,796 --> 00:09:33,756
Only for
personal reasons like...

172
00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:36,842
I have no idea what physics is.

173
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:40,388
But enough about me.
Tell me about your crisis.
What's going on?

174
00:09:41,472 --> 00:09:43,224
Well, I'm

175
00:09:43,307 --> 00:09:45,142
supposed to move tomorrow.

176
00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:47,186
Big move, actually in, uh,

177
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,940
seven hours and...

178
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,400
Let's just say
it's a big commitment

179
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:55,236
and I'm not
a big commitment kinda gal.

180
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:57,154
Are you saying we're in
one of those

181
00:09:57,238 --> 00:10:00,366
classic "we-only-
have-tonight" scenarios?

182
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:02,660
Will spending it with you
make me wanna stay?

183
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,289
[Walt] Now,
the thing about here,

184
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,707
is that it's mostly garbage.

185
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,501
As you can see, to your left
and to your right

186
00:10:10,584 --> 00:10:12,420
there's literal garbage
overflowing from

187
00:10:12,503 --> 00:10:14,004
these receptacles at all times.

188
00:10:14,088 --> 00:10:15,965
-Yeah.
-And it might magically
seem to disappear

189
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,843
but it's really just added
to that big floating pile
of garbage

190
00:10:18,926 --> 00:10:20,386
in the Pacific Ocean.

191
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:22,138
Currently the size of Texas
and visible from space.

192
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:23,681
How scenic.

193
00:10:23,764 --> 00:10:25,808
Now, the one great thing

194
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,810
about this particular
garbage factory

195
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,062
is its connection to
the last best chance

196
00:10:30,146 --> 00:10:32,440
any of us have
at a real adventure.

197
00:10:33,858 --> 00:10:36,152
The Kovi Industries
Mars Program.

198
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:37,987
So that's how
they got you here.

199
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:43,993
Yeah. But tomorrow another ship
will leave for Mars without me.

200
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,828
You could always rob a bank
and buy a ticket.

201
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,080
-Yeah, I'd have to rob,
like, nine banks.
-Hmm.

202
00:10:48,164 --> 00:10:50,458
I have considered
the old air ducts plan.

203
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,210
You know, hide in the air ducts
survive on stolen food.

204
00:10:53,294 --> 00:10:55,671
Pee in bottles that you dump
into other people's toilets
while they sleep.

205
00:10:55,754 --> 00:10:59,467
[Walt] And hope they would be
so impressed when I arrive
that they just let me stay.

206
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,968
[Ginny laughs]

207
00:11:04,722 --> 00:11:08,517
Curious how you spin garbage
into this spot.

208
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,603
[Walt] This is
a garbage-free zone.

209
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:17,234
It's like Mars.

210
00:11:17,318 --> 00:11:19,069
Did you know that they send
all of their trash

211
00:11:19,153 --> 00:11:20,988
back to Earth
on the return flights?

212
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,744
Okay, I gotta know.

213
00:11:27,828 --> 00:11:29,205
Why Mars?

214
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:38,881
I feel like if I had been born
like 600 years ago

215
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:42,968
I would've stolen a boat
and just set sail by now.

216
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:44,553
And I probably would've died.

217
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:45,846
Oh, definitely would've died.

218
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,431
But it would've been
an adventure.

219
00:11:48,724 --> 00:11:49,892
You know?

220
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,603
And now there's Mars
and I keep applying,

221
00:11:52,686 --> 00:11:54,772
but 36 rejections later

222
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:56,482
and I'm starting to get
the feeling that...

223
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:59,276
They don't need
extraordinary mediocrity?

224
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,237
Yeah. That's funny.

225
00:12:05,783 --> 00:12:07,201
No, I get it.

226
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:11,997

227

our foil.

228
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:18,337
A telltale reflection of what
has been deepest in our hearts.

229
00:12:20,214 --> 00:12:23,217
We've seen in Mars the utopia,

230
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,429
a wilderness, a sanctuary.

231
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:31,850
With so few landmarks,
guideposts, or constraints

232
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,562
all is possible.

233
00:12:35,896 --> 00:12:37,856
Mars has been a blank canvas

234
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,817
and tenderly

235
00:12:41,235 --> 00:12:43,279

has rushed to fill it."

-Hmm.

I think

00:12:59,878 --> 00:13:02,089
when you look at something
from this distance,

243
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:04,174
it's all possibility.

Then every step you take
toward that

00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,049
who knows exactly
what you're going through.

341
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:57,634
Because you're causing it?

342
00:17:58,886 --> 00:18:02,598
No. Because my girlfriend

343
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,641
left for Mars a month ago

344
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:06,977
and hasn't texted me back
in three days.

345
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,735
How long have you guys
been together?

346
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:18,363
Since ninth grade.
So, eight years.

347
00:18:18,447 --> 00:18:20,699
Eight years?

348
00:18:20,782 --> 00:18:23,744
-How did you manage that?
-We had a plan.

349
00:18:23,827 --> 00:18:26,121
One year, long distance
and then

350
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,082
he comes back to Earth
and I graduate

351
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,710
and we use his terraforming
expertise and my focus

352
00:18:31,793 --> 00:18:35,756
on eco reconstruction
to jump-start an algae-based
waste reduction technology.

353
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:38,967
-What?
-Plants that eat garbage, okay?

354
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,094
It's how we're gonna save
the world.

355
00:18:41,178 --> 00:18:44,348
-You're smart. [laughs]
-I know.

356
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,683
And what about you guys?

357
00:18:48,435 --> 00:18:50,312
Ginny?

358
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:53,732
We've been dating since
freshman year-ish.

359
00:18:53,815 --> 00:18:55,108
It got serious recently.

360
00:18:55,192 --> 00:18:57,486
What does this Mars genius have

361
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:58,946
that I don't?

362
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:01,907
-Everything. Yeah.
-Everything?

363
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,825
Could you actually be
more specific?

364
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,869
I'm trying to figure out why
they keep rejecting
my applications.

365
00:19:09,623 --> 00:19:11,458
[Sophie] He checks
all the boxes.

366
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,587
Oh. You mean, literally.

367
00:19:16,672 --> 00:19:18,173
Okay, let's see.

368
00:19:18,256 --> 00:19:20,175
"Quiet. Strong jaw.

369
00:19:20,258 --> 00:19:22,386
Mental fortitude. Six-pack.

370
00:19:25,263 --> 00:19:27,557
Good family, cool mom."
I have a cool mom.

371
00:19:27,641 --> 00:19:29,393
Yeah? You guys close?

372
00:19:29,476 --> 00:19:31,478
No. I mean "cool," like when
she was going
through the divorce

373
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:34,189
I was able to just do whatever
I wanted from 12 on.

374
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:35,649
Anyhow. "Hates video games.

375
00:19:35,732 --> 00:19:38,276
Pragmatic and high-earning
potential."

376
00:19:40,487 --> 00:19:42,406
-It's interesting.
-What?

377
00:19:42,489 --> 00:19:44,408
That's an impossible checklist.

378
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:48,537
-That's my cue.
-You know,
if you really love this guy

379
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,082
I do know a way that you can
get on that ship tomorrow.

380
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,543
Two words.

381
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,378
Air ducts.

382
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,755
-Or I could just buy a ticket.
-Yeah, for like
a million dollars.

383
00:20:04,428 --> 00:20:05,804
Do you have a million dollars?

384
00:20:05,887 --> 00:20:09,391
-My finances are personal.
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

385
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:12,269
That means you have
at least two million dollars.

386
00:20:12,352 --> 00:20:13,937
What are you doing here?

387
00:20:14,021 --> 00:20:15,397
Buy a ticket!

388
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,316
-It's your last chance
for a year.
-I can't.

389
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,110
You have the money.

390
00:20:20,193 --> 00:20:22,904
I have aerophobia.

391
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,198
Well, we're all afraid
of arrows.

392
00:20:25,282 --> 00:20:27,451
Oh, my God!
I'm afraid of flying.

393
00:20:27,534 --> 00:20:28,952
[door buzzes]

394
00:20:29,036 --> 00:20:31,204
-And now I'm trapped.
-You're trapped? I'm trapped.

395
00:20:31,288 --> 00:20:33,206
-[Sophie] Gary, door!
-I can't even
get through security

396
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,292
to see
a shuttle launch up-close.

397
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:39,046
-Unlock the door, Gary.
-I'm afraid I can't do that.
Perhaps it's malware.

398
00:20:39,129 --> 00:20:41,631
You can transcend
time and space.

399
00:20:41,715 --> 00:20:43,842
In the name of love.
The ultimate adventure.

400
00:20:43,925 --> 00:20:46,344
I'm filing a complaint
to corporate right now.
Open the door.

401
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:48,555
[Gary] No need
to call corporate.

402
00:20:48,638 --> 00:20:50,599
A simple misunderstanding.

403
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:54,019
Walk away. Just like
I knew you would.

404
00:20:54,102 --> 00:20:57,731
-You don't know anything
about me.
-I know everything about you.

405
00:20:57,814 --> 00:20:59,274
No!

406
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:02,319
The only people who know me
are 55 million miles away!

407
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:09,951
The only people who know me
are 55 million miles away.

408
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,162
The only people
that know me are...

409
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,790
Gary?

410
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,792
Oh, God, that's sad.

411
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,710
No, no. No. Please, please.

412
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:21,797
Don't call corporate on Gary.
He's just gonna take it
out on me.

413
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,548
Calvin is on Mars.

414
00:21:23,632 --> 00:21:25,509
Jan, Brandon, Jim,
they're all there.

415
00:21:25,592 --> 00:21:27,385
How many boyfriends
do you have?

416
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:29,137
It's really that simple.

417
00:21:35,811 --> 00:21:37,395
Goodbye, Walt.

418
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,617
[objects clattering]

419
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,286
-[grunts in frustration]

420
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:00,502

422

423
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:07,300

426
00:22:14,683 --> 00:22:17,978

427
00:22:18,061 --> 00:22:20,647
<i>I named her Ripley. Say hi.</i>

428
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,649

<i>-...into one of our escape pods</i>
<i>back on Earth.</i>
-Oh, my God.

431
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:36,121
[Gary] Walt, I saw you
consuming alcohol.

432
00:22:36,204 --> 00:22:38,540
I must administer
a breathalyzer.

433
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,750
-Breathe on my face.
-[Walt] Bye, Gary.

434
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:45,797
-I'll miss you.
-[Gary] Goodbye, Walt.

435
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:48,383
I have already forgotten you.

436
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:00,937
[whispering] Okay.
You can do this. You're okay.

437
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:11,615
[over speakers]<i> I'm billionaire</i>
<i>astronaut Leon Kovi</i>

438
00:23:11,698 --> 00:23:16,411
<i>and it's my pleasure to welcome</i>

439
00:23:16,494 --> 00:23:19,873
<i>Together, we can build</i>

440
00:23:19,956 --> 00:23:21,750

441
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,169
-Hey!
-Oh, my God.

442
00:23:24,252 --> 00:23:25,837
What are you doing here?

443
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:27,923
And what are you wearing?

444
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:30,508
I just came to see the launch.
And I got all this duty-free.

445
00:23:30,592 --> 00:23:32,177
Wore it right out of the store.

446
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,262
Duty-free doesn't mean free.
You just robbed a gift shop.

447
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:35,972
What? No.

448
00:23:36,056 --> 00:23:37,557
Wait, really?

449
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:43,438
Look, I just came to apologize.
I was a dick.
Also, I need a favor.

450
00:23:43,521 --> 00:23:45,941
You are the ingrown toenail
of humanity.

451
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,485
-Leave me alone.
-Just hear me out
for one minute.

452
00:23:48,568 --> 00:23:50,612
All I need is for you to tell
security I'm your family

453
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,364
-so I can accompany you
to the gate.
-What?

454
00:23:52,447 --> 00:23:55,116
No. God! I'm leaving this
planet largely because of you.

455
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,744
And I totally understand.
Again, so, so sorry.

456
00:23:57,827 --> 00:24:00,288
-It's just...
-It's just, "Go away."

457
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,168
You had a plan, right?

458
00:24:05,252 --> 00:24:06,878
So you know what it feels like
when that plan
gets taken from you.

459
00:24:06,962 --> 00:24:08,797
How it just kills you?

460
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,091
I barely got in this school.
I took out 100 loans

461
00:24:11,174 --> 00:24:14,094
and I worked a dozen crappy
jobs because this was my plan.

462
00:24:14,177 --> 00:24:15,553
To go to Mars.

463
00:24:15,637 --> 00:24:17,806
And now Ginny is there
and I have to be with her.

464
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,475
I have to adventure with her.
Just like you.

465
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:22,686
-Just like Kelvin.
-Calvin.

466
00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:24,562
Just like Calvin.

467
00:24:24,646 --> 00:24:26,481
But now Ginny is gone.

468
00:24:26,564 --> 00:24:30,026
And all I have left is
one last chance to see
a rocket launch up close

469
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:33,154
which I have dreamt about
for as long as I can remember.

470
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,532
Sophie...

471
00:24:35,615 --> 00:24:38,159
you can keep my dream alive,

472
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,620
if only for
a couple more hours.

473
00:24:44,332 --> 00:24:47,419
Please. Please help me.

474
00:24:48,712 --> 00:24:51,339
You are not allowed to talk.

475
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,721
[Walt] And on the first
colonial mission
the ship's hull was damaged.

476
00:24:57,804 --> 00:24:59,514
Kovi had to survive
in the air ducts.

477
00:24:59,597 --> 00:25:01,349
Now, he almost died,

478
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,601
but his lung capacity
is unparalleled.

479
00:25:03,685 --> 00:25:06,229
My lung capacity is also
kind of unparalleled.

480
00:25:06,313 --> 00:25:08,064
When I was a kid, I actually
went under in the wave pool.

481
00:25:08,148 --> 00:25:09,566
I was down there for, like,
three minutes

482
00:25:09,649 --> 00:25:11,359
before anyone could
even pull me back up.

483
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:14,487
They all thought I drowned,
but I really just passed out.

484
00:25:14,571 --> 00:25:16,656
That's why I never go to
the bathroom in the wave pool.

485
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,075
Did you know that this whole
building is triple-reinforced
with concrete?

486
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:22,120
Space concrete. In case
the shuttle explodes
on the launchpad.

487
00:25:22,203 --> 00:25:24,539
Which has only happened twice.

488
00:25:24,622 --> 00:25:26,374
-[Walt] What's happening?
-[Sophie] Shut up.

489
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,543
It's something I have to do
when I'm nervous.

490
00:25:28,626 --> 00:25:32,005
-I dance to relieve tension.
-No, no, no. I'm into it.

491
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,383
-Don't make fun of me.
-I'm not.

492
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,053
This is the first
interesting thing
I've seen you do.

493
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,721
[Sophie] I hate when boys
do that.

494
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:43,266
As if they are the arbiters
of all that is interesting.

495
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:48,229
[woman on speaker]<i> Final call</i>
<i>for all zones.</i>

496
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,440
<i>Final boarding call</i>
<i>for all zones.</i>

497
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:58,031
-Okay. This is it.
-This is it.

498
00:25:58,114 --> 00:25:59,699
Goodbye forever, Walt.

499
00:26:00,742 --> 00:26:02,786
-Well, maybe not forever.
-Forever.

500
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:05,080
Oh, I actually
got you something.

501
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:06,748
Don't worry,
I paid for it this time.

502
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,416
But Duty Free should really
change its name.

503
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,378
-Walt.
-Right. Yeah.

504
00:26:11,461 --> 00:26:12,962
Thank you for everything.

505
00:26:13,046 --> 00:26:14,798
Also, makes us even
for the orb.

00:35:50,247 --> 00:35:53,167
Says here you were already on
the Olarun Two.

674
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,877
Oh, there...

675
00:35:54,961 --> 00:35:57,213
Earl, this is a clerical error.

676
00:35:57,296 --> 00:36:00,466
You know how computers
just get buggy sometimes?

677
00:36:00,549 --> 00:36:03,010
Why are you two standing
so far apart?

678
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:06,263
Most young couples are all over
each other, kissing...

679
00:36:06,347 --> 00:36:08,599
at an alarming frequency.

680
00:36:08,683 --> 00:36:09,725
Yeah.

681
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:11,852
That makes sense.

682
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,270
Right, sweetie?

683
00:36:13,354 --> 00:36:14,522
[groans softly]

684
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:18,526
Ah!

685
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:21,612
Say, Earl... what's this?

686
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:24,615
Space wine.

687
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:25,574
Cool.

688
00:36:25,658 --> 00:36:27,868
I usually drink alone.

689
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:30,913
I gave Carla a glass...

690
00:36:30,997 --> 00:36:32,623
but she can't hold her liquor.

691
00:36:32,707 --> 00:36:33,791
Carla?

692
00:36:33,874 --> 00:36:36,293
Oh. Carla, the computer.

693
00:36:36,377 --> 00:36:38,796
[Carla] You can't hold
your liquor.

694
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:39,880
[warbles]

695
00:36:41,382 --> 00:36:42,383
Uh...

696
00:36:43,009 --> 00:36:43,884
Earl...

697
00:36:45,261 --> 00:36:46,679
-[slow music playing]
-[sizzling]

698
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,643
-[electricity crackling]
-Oh!

699
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:54,520
All right.

700
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:56,981
Soft reboot, Earl.

701
00:36:57,064 --> 00:36:59,233
How do you know
how to do all this?

702
00:36:59,316 --> 00:37:01,986
My thesis is on eliminating
planned obsolescence

703
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:03,863
and universal
mechanical literacy

704
00:37:03,946 --> 00:37:07,283
as key tools to promote
biospheric sustainability.

705
00:37:07,366 --> 00:37:10,119
It'd be kind of ironic
if I didn't know how to fix it,
you know?

706
00:37:10,202 --> 00:37:12,580
Yeah. Yeah,
I know, I know. I do know...

707
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:13,539
It's ironic.

708
00:37:13,622 --> 00:37:15,583
[Carla] Earl, is that you?

709
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,293
I had the most terrible dream.

710
00:37:17,376 --> 00:37:19,462
[Earl] Let's get you that ID.

711
00:37:19,545 --> 00:37:20,713
[Cornelia] Hello, Calvin.

712
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,757
Hello, Calvin.

713
00:37:23,966 --> 00:37:25,092
Hello, Calvin.

714
00:37:27,428 --> 00:37:29,305
Your photo will show up
in all the system reports

715
00:37:29,388 --> 00:37:33,017
so as long as no one does
a deep search,
you should be fine.

716
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,394
Calvin hates social media.

717
00:37:35,478 --> 00:37:38,397
Okay. Amazing.
Wow. My heart is racing.
What are we doing next?

718
00:37:38,481 --> 00:37:39,565
Next? We lay low.

719
00:37:39,648 --> 00:37:41,984
What? No.
Oh, my heart.

720
00:37:42,068 --> 00:37:43,110
-Gary?
-Cornelia.

721
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:44,612
Cornelia, is my heart normal?

722
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,280
[Cornelia] Your biorhythms
are elevated.

723
00:37:46,363 --> 00:37:48,866
You may be experiencing
cardiac arrest...

724
00:37:48,949 --> 00:37:50,618
or sexual reproduction.

725
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,661
Oh, it's definitely not
sexual reproduction.

726
00:37:52,745 --> 00:37:53,954
Okay. We need a routine.

727
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:56,874
Be seen enough
not to draw attention.

728
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:59,168
Oh, here we go.

729
00:37:59,251 --> 00:38:01,670
A lecture series by a few
of the Mars specialists
on board.

730
00:38:01,754 --> 00:38:02,880
[Walt] Hard pass.

731
00:38:02,963 --> 00:38:04,298
-Bathing in zero G...
-Soft maybe.

732
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:06,967
Food tube cooking, spacewalk...

733
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,135
Spacewalk?

734
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,804
No. You need a partner for that

735
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:12,473
and there's no way I'm getting
off the ship until it lands.

736
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:15,476
Come on, Sophie.
We are in the clear.

737
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:16,936
Let's go have some fun.

738
00:38:17,019 --> 00:38:18,145
We're not gonna get caught.

739
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:20,189
They're not gonna kick us off.

740
00:38:20,272 --> 00:38:21,440
Check it. Cornelia?

741
00:38:21,524 --> 00:38:22,983
[Cornelia]
Greetings, Calvin-Walt.

742
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:24,777
Nope. Just Calvin.

743
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,071
Cornelia, wasn't there
a stowaway on the Olarun Three?

744
00:38:27,154 --> 00:38:28,656
[Cornelia] Yes.
A feline was discovered.

745
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:31,283
And isn't that cat
now the very first cat on Mars?

746
00:38:31,367 --> 00:38:32,701
<i>-No.</i>
-See?

747
00:38:32,785 --> 00:38:34,537
What?

748
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,039
[Cornelia] She is awaiting
trial for her crimes against
the company.

749
00:38:37,123 --> 00:38:38,290
Ripley.

750
00:38:38,374 --> 00:38:40,042
And that's why we stick
to the plan.

751
00:38:40,126 --> 00:38:41,919
-What's this?
-Calvin's practice interviews.

752
00:38:42,002 --> 00:38:44,505
If you're going to be him,
you have to get to know him.

753
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:46,215
You filmed them?

754
00:38:46,298 --> 00:38:49,176
I will download
his thesis for you
and explain it to you,

755
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,930
and show you
some of the messages
he sent me.

756
00:38:53,013 --> 00:38:53,848
The PG ones.

757
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:55,975
You mean the boring ones.

758
00:38:56,058 --> 00:38:58,686
Cornelia,
please dim the lights.

759
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,316
This is gonna suck, isn't it?

760
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,235
[Sophie] Only for 35 days.

761
00:39:08,821 --> 00:39:10,156
[upbeat music playing]

762
00:39:16,078 --> 00:39:19,165
We can do quizzes
at 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m.

763
00:39:19,248 --> 00:39:21,250
-Two a day?
-Yes!

764
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:22,376
What about...

765
00:39:22,459 --> 00:39:23,919
personal intimacy time?

766
00:39:24,003 --> 00:39:26,046
We share that room.

767
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,757
Exercise some self-control.

768
00:39:35,931 --> 00:39:38,100
[Calvin]<i> Hey, there she is.</i>

769
00:39:38,184 --> 00:39:40,561
<i>-Sorry, do we have</i>
<i>a call scheduled?</i>
-No, no, we didn't.

770
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:43,731
I just thought that you might
be in the mood.

771
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:45,232
Got to shit.

772
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:47,443
Wrong room! Wrong room!

773
00:39:47,526 --> 00:39:50,154
Whoa! Whoa! Hypocrite!
Hypocrite! Hypocrite!

774
00:39:50,237 --> 00:39:51,739
<i>Sophie! Sophie?</i>

775
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:54,241
-You get 10 minutes a day.
-15.

776
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,410
-Twelve.
-Fine.

777
00:39:56,493 --> 00:40:03,584
Humans. AI. A crucial
relationship that should
always remain professional.

778
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,544
Even I struggle to follow.

779
00:40:05,628 --> 00:40:07,880
We would love it if you would
do a lecture on terraforming.

780
00:40:07,963 --> 00:40:09,882
-No.
-Since you are the expert.

781
00:40:09,965 --> 00:40:14,303
He had a traumatic accident
on stage last year

782
00:40:14,386 --> 00:40:17,014
and he's recovering still.

783
00:40:17,097 --> 00:40:18,349
Did you get an erection?

784
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,850
-What?
-Yes.

785
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:21,268
-Oh, my God.
-Wow.

786
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,312
-You have to keep
a low profile.
-I am.

787
00:40:23,395 --> 00:40:26,357
People wanna hang out with me
even after the erection rumors.

788
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,609
It's weird, I know. It's never
happened to me before.

789
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:31,028
It's because
they wanna hang out
with Calvin.

790
00:40:31,111 --> 00:40:32,780
Ginny doesn't care
if I work out.

791
00:40:33,989 --> 00:40:35,449
She does.

792
00:40:35,532 --> 00:40:36,617
No, she doesn't.

793
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:38,994
She does.

794
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,164
Hey. No.

795
00:40:42,248 --> 00:40:43,749
Pick it up.

796
00:40:43,832 --> 00:40:45,834
[Calvin]<i> Given my major</i>
<i>in biochemical engineering</i>

797
00:40:45,918 --> 00:40:48,754
<i>and my parents' existing</i>
<i>employment at Kovi</i>
<i>Industries.</i>

798
00:40:48,837 --> 00:40:50,506
<i>Not that I should be hired...</i>

799
00:40:50,589 --> 00:40:53,425
<i>through nepotism or something</i>
<i>like that.</i>

800
00:40:53,509 --> 00:40:55,135
<i>I just mean that maybe if I</i>
<i>could...</i>

801
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:57,513
-[Sophie]<i> Hey, relax.</i>
<i>-I am relaxed.</i>

802
00:40:57,596 --> 00:41:00,015
[Sophie]<i> You're doing fine.</i>

803
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:02,226
<i>Why don't you talk about how</i>
<i>we use the same tech on Earth</i>
<i>to aid in waste reduction...</i>

804
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:04,103
<i>-Sophie.</i>
<i>-...develop new bioplastics,</i>
<i>and innovate...</i>

805
00:41:04,186 --> 00:41:06,897
-Sophie.
<i>-Please just focus</i>
<i>on the camera.</i>

806
00:41:06,981 --> 00:41:09,775
<i>If I deviate too much,</i>
<i>they'll just skip to the</i>
<i>next applicant, okay?</i>

807
00:41:09,858 --> 00:41:11,735
[Sophie]<i> Sure. Rolling.</i>

808
00:41:11,819 --> 00:41:13,904
[male voice]<i> Good night,</i>
<i>sweet passengers.</i>

809
00:41:13,988 --> 00:41:17,157
<i>May your dreams be filled</i>
<i>with the counting</i>
<i>of electric sheep.</i>

810
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:20,369
[Ginny]<i> Hey!</i>
<i>You're coming to Mars?</i>

811
00:41:20,452 --> 00:41:22,746
<i>-And then you go radio silent?</i>
-Mother...

812
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:24,456
-[Cornelia] Hello, Sophie.
-Privacy! Privacy!

813
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,333
-Wait! Are you watching porn?
<i>-You're coming to Mars?</i>

814
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:27,835
-What? No!
-Lights!

815
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:29,169
Pause. Just pause.

816
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,671
Play.

817
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:34,258
<i>Hi. You're coming to Mars?</i>

818
00:41:34,341 --> 00:41:36,927
<i>And then you go radio silent?</i>

819
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:38,762
<i>I don't know if you're</i>
<i>serious or not...</i>

820
00:41:38,846 --> 00:41:41,849
<i>-but call me.</i>
-You logged in?
Are you kidding?

821
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:45,102
I couldn't tell if Ginny was
actually excited that I was
coming to Mars.

822
00:41:45,185 --> 00:41:47,396
I'm just trying to get
a more scientific answer.

823
00:41:47,479 --> 00:41:51,358
You're using facial recognition
software to find out if your
girlfriend likes you?

824
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:54,236
[male computer voice]
<i>Likelihood of</i>
<i>romantic interest...</i>

825
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,571
<i>-82%.</i>
-Yeah!

826
00:41:55,654 --> 00:41:57,698
-Who was that?
-[Gary]<i> I am Gary.</i>

827
00:41:57,781 --> 00:42:00,826
That's Cornelia. I reprogrammed
her name and voice to Gary.
After Gary.

828
00:42:00,909 --> 00:42:02,411
You can't do that.

829
00:42:02,494 --> 00:42:04,079
I'm lonely.
And you don't let me
talk to anyone.

830
00:42:04,163 --> 00:42:06,457
No. You can't change things
without telling me, okay?

831
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,542
There's a plan
and we stick to the plan.

832
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:11,879
If we don't, we go to jail,
or we get ejected into the sun.

833
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:13,380
You can't just unilaterally
change things

834
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:15,549
because you're insecure
about your relationship.

835
00:42:15,632 --> 00:42:17,801
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you talking
to me or are you talking to
Calvin right now?

836
00:42:17,885 --> 00:42:19,219
What's that supposed to mean?

837
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:21,263
I didn't change your plans.
Calvin did.

838
00:42:21,347 --> 00:42:24,224
I didn't ditch you
to go to Mars
for a job, Calvin did.

839
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:27,561
-I didn't refuse
to send you nudes.
-[gasps]

840
00:42:27,644 --> 00:42:28,771
Those texts were off-limits.

841
00:42:28,854 --> 00:42:30,731
I saw them by accident.

842
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:33,901
Where are you going?

843
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:36,487
I saw Earl eating ice cream,
but they don't serve it
in the cafeteria,

844
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:39,323
which means he's got his own
little supply that I'm gonna
steal from

845
00:42:39,406 --> 00:42:42,284
because I am stressed.
And when I'm stressed,
I need sugar.

846
00:42:42,368 --> 00:42:43,243
No!

847
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:54,922
I work here!

848
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:56,757
Does that ever really work?

849
00:42:58,425 --> 00:42:59,802
Most of the time, yeah.

850
00:42:59,885 --> 00:43:01,261
We have to get out of here.

851
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:02,596
We are going to get caught.

852
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:05,307
You are the only person that
ever catches me.

853
00:43:05,391 --> 00:43:06,767
Okay. Okay.

854
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:09,061
If you're gonna be here,
you gotta pull your weight.

855
00:43:09,144 --> 00:43:11,855
I know you're not used to this
sort of sneaking around,
espionage thing.

856
00:43:11,939 --> 00:43:13,440
I am. I'm the expert here,

857
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:15,567
so I'm gonna be looking
for the refrigeration unit.

858
00:43:15,651 --> 00:43:17,569
The cooling kind.

859
00:43:17,653 --> 00:43:18,862
Like that one?

860
00:43:21,657 --> 00:43:23,325
Okay. Come on.

861
00:43:23,409 --> 00:43:26,453
Guess this means
I'm kinda grounded
for the rest of the flight?

862
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,455
-Kinda.
-Copy that.

863
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:31,250
And can you please keep
your opinions about
my relationship to yourself?

864
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:33,377
You've no idea what
we've been through.

865
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,962
[Carla] Hello, Sophie.

866
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:36,296
[Walt] You're right.

867
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,216
[Carla] Ambient sound
control activated.

868
00:43:39,299 --> 00:43:40,300
Sorry.

869
00:43:44,138 --> 00:43:46,056
Okay. Apology accepted.

870
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,142
You know,
you're almost always right.

871
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:50,310
Even in those last three
arguments with Calvin.

872
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:52,104
And I know I shouldn't
have read them...

873
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:54,815
but you were right.

874
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:58,152
It's honestly creepy
and kind of annoying
how right you are all the time.

875
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:02,448
Especially as someone
who is wrong almost
all the time. Never right.

876
00:44:02,531 --> 00:44:04,491
Well, except right now.

877
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:05,993
Me saying that you're right--

878
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:09,496
Okay. I got it. Thanks.
Now, let's go.

879
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:13,834
And you're totally right
to lock me in here
for the rest of the trip.

880
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:15,210
[sighs]

881
00:44:15,294 --> 00:44:17,463
But can we please start
my house arrest tomorrow?

882
00:44:18,964 --> 00:44:20,090
Why?

883
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:24,303
This is made out of algae?

884
00:44:27,222 --> 00:44:28,348
Smells like it.

885
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:30,434
This is pretty bad.

886
00:44:30,517 --> 00:44:32,019
It's awful.

887
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:33,353
Calvin would love it.

888
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:34,646
Okay, that's...

889
00:44:35,647 --> 00:44:36,773
probably true.

890
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,485
I don't know how he does it.

891
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,487
Does what?

892
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:45,032
Super focused,
algae genius thing.

893
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:46,200
Like it's all he thinks about.

894
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:48,327
It's not all he thinks about.

895
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:50,537
Okay, well...

896
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:52,664
the great thing
about being Walt,

897
00:44:52,748 --> 00:44:56,877
is that he's not smart enough
to think about any one thing
for too long.

898
00:44:57,836 --> 00:45:00,380
I miss Walt. Good guy.

899
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:01,465
Handsome.

900
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:05,469
So, what about you and Ginny?

901
00:45:07,429 --> 00:45:09,139
What about us?

902
00:45:09,223 --> 00:45:12,267
You're flying to Mars
for her. You must
have some sort of plan.

903
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:14,269
I don't know.

904
00:45:16,021 --> 00:45:18,607
I steal the spaceship...

905
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:20,734
travel the stars...

906
00:45:20,817 --> 00:45:22,194
adventure.

907
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:26,323
What?

908
00:45:26,406 --> 00:45:30,327
You've been on a spaceship,
traveling through the stars
your entire life.

909
00:45:34,748 --> 00:45:35,999
Earth.

910
00:45:37,918 --> 00:45:40,087
In a billion years...

911
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:44,883
we will never build
or find anything quite like it.

912
00:45:45,717 --> 00:45:47,886
It's our only spaceship.

913
00:45:50,472 --> 00:45:54,643
What could we possibly
do out here that
we couldn't do there?

914
00:45:56,979 --> 00:46:01,233
You ever worry the wrong person
is headed to the wrong planet?

915
00:46:02,234 --> 00:46:03,318
Me and Calvin?

916
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:06,613
No.

917
00:46:07,656 --> 00:46:09,032
We'll be back.

918
00:46:09,116 --> 00:46:11,785
Once his contract
is up... [sighs]

919
00:46:11,868 --> 00:46:14,413
First his turn, then my turn.

920
00:46:14,496 --> 00:46:16,957
Right. The plan.

921
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,167
We're building a life together.

922
00:46:19,251 --> 00:46:23,630
And when you find
something extraordinary,
you fight for it.

923
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:26,466
Sacrifice for it. Protect it.

924
00:46:27,426 --> 00:46:28,969
Yes.

925
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:33,849
Because what most of us
fail to appreciate...

926
00:46:33,932 --> 00:46:39,313
when presented with something
truly unique, is that it will
only ever exist once.

927
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:40,897
You read my thesis.

928
00:46:40,981 --> 00:46:42,691
I may have even understood it.

929
00:46:42,774 --> 00:46:46,445
That is weirdly touching.

930
00:47:02,794 --> 00:47:04,171
That algae really
isn't sitting well.

931
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:06,548
Don't mention algae.

932
00:47:06,632 --> 00:47:08,467
[Tabby] Hello, peers.

933
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:12,346
Unfortunately,
I've just learned
that our scheduled speaker,

934
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,556
Doctor Franklin Dearborn...

935
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,185
has come down with a mild case
of "space madness."

936
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,187
-Awesome.
-And his scheduled presentation

937
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:24,900
on the theoretical limits
of quantum propulsion
is being rescheduled.

938
00:47:24,983 --> 00:47:27,944
However, I was
logging on to one of
the community terminals

939
00:47:28,028 --> 00:47:32,282
and I came across
this fascinating
thesis presentation.

940
00:47:33,408 --> 00:47:34,576
There it is.

941
00:47:35,327 --> 00:47:37,287
Calvin Riggins...

942
00:47:37,371 --> 00:47:39,289
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, my God.

943
00:47:39,373 --> 00:47:42,584
...is our very modest but very
accomplished expert in
terraformation.

944
00:47:42,668 --> 00:47:44,169
And I'm hoping
he'll save the day

945
00:47:44,252 --> 00:47:46,380
by coming up here
and teaching us a bit

946
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:49,466
about how Mars will someday
be as green as Earth.

947
00:47:49,549 --> 00:47:52,177
Hopefully, greener,
as Earth is dying.

948
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,347
Come on up here, Calvin.

949
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:57,140
[applauding]

950
00:47:57,224 --> 00:48:00,102
-What do I do?
-I don't know. Maybe just riff.

951
00:48:00,185 --> 00:48:01,520
Isn't, like, talking
your superpower?

952
00:48:01,603 --> 00:48:02,771
Calvin!

953
00:48:02,854 --> 00:48:03,730
One second.

954
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:05,899
Calvin! Calvin!

955
00:48:05,982 --> 00:48:07,734
[all] Calvin! Calvin!

956
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,986
Give me one of your earbuds.
We'll use it like a
walkie-talkie.

957
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:11,613
You can just tell me
what to say.

958
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:13,782
I left them in the room.

959
00:48:13,865 --> 00:48:15,450
[woman] Get up here!

960
00:48:15,534 --> 00:48:17,619
Have them eject me
towards the sun.

961
00:48:17,703 --> 00:48:19,538
[woman] Calvin! All right,
here he comes!

962
00:48:19,621 --> 00:48:22,040
He's coming up!

963
00:48:22,124 --> 00:48:25,836
Don't worry.
If you get an erection,
keep going.

964
00:48:25,919 --> 00:48:27,045
[mic feedback buzzes]

965
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:33,885
Uh, hi.

966
00:48:36,471 --> 00:48:41,810
I'm Calvin.
I'm a terraformologist.

967
00:48:41,893 --> 00:48:43,103
[audience chuckles softly]

968
00:48:44,104 --> 00:48:45,939
[boy] Zinger!

969
00:48:46,022 --> 00:48:48,150
Let's start with the basics.

970
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,777
Terraforming...

971
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:54,406
which comes from
the Latin term "Terra..."

972
00:48:54,489 --> 00:48:56,324
-Oh, God.
-...meaning "Earth..."

973
00:48:56,408 --> 00:48:58,869
and forming...

974
00:48:58,952 --> 00:49:01,163
That's forming.

975
00:49:05,417 --> 00:49:08,211
"Changing Mars for us."

976
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:11,965
Changing for us.

977
00:49:14,634 --> 00:49:15,594
Changing...

978
00:49:20,849 --> 00:49:24,811
Someone a lot smarter than me
once said that Mars
is like our mirror.

979
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:28,482
The reflection of
what is deepest in our hearts.

980
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,358
Calvin, that's so true.

981
00:49:30,442 --> 00:49:32,861
After traveling with you guys
for the last few weeks,

982
00:49:32,944 --> 00:49:37,073
I don't really know
if that's true anymore.

983
00:49:37,157 --> 00:49:41,328
When I look at you,
I see the smartest people
on the planet.

984
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:44,998
And you've spent
your entire lives

985
00:49:45,081 --> 00:49:49,711
trying to check an impossible
set of boxes...

986
00:49:51,087 --> 00:49:52,714
for Mars.

987
00:49:52,798 --> 00:49:54,508
And I get it.

988
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:57,469
Mars is awesome. I applied to
this program, like, 37 times.

989
00:49:57,552 --> 00:49:59,095
[all chuckling]

990
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:06,394
But maybe
when you find that thing

991
00:50:06,478 --> 00:50:09,356
that you're willing
to cross the entire universe
to be with...

992
00:50:12,067 --> 00:50:14,653
just make sure it's ready
to do the same for you.

993
00:50:17,989 --> 00:50:20,075
Don't terraform yourself.

994
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:23,328
It's your life, too.

995
00:50:36,383 --> 00:50:37,968
[computer]
<i>Thanks for listening!</i>

996
00:50:39,719 --> 00:50:40,887
I'm done.

997
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:43,390
That was it? A little short.

998
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:45,016
Tabby...

999
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,309
let's get married.

1000
00:50:47,936 --> 00:50:49,271
What?

1001
00:50:49,354 --> 00:50:51,606
I mean engaged to get married.

1002
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:56,194
Calvin's presentation,
it was useless from
a technical perspective...

1003
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,698
but he's right.

1004
00:50:59,781 --> 00:51:02,284
I should have
never put Mars before us.

1005
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:04,494
Before you.

1006
00:51:04,578 --> 00:51:06,580
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1007
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:08,623
What say you, woman?

1008
00:51:08,707 --> 00:51:09,708
Yes!

1009
00:51:10,208 --> 00:51:11,334
Yes!

1010
00:51:11,418 --> 00:51:12,669
[all cheering]

1011
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,257
Listen up, everybody.

1012
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:21,261
Mandatory engagement party
in T-minus 30 minutes.

1013
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:22,804
[upbeat music playing]

1014
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:27,434
It's finally happening!

1015
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:30,061
A real dance party!

1016
00:51:30,145 --> 00:51:32,063
It's time to shine, bitch.

1017
00:51:32,731 --> 00:51:34,065
[whoops]

1018
00:51:37,068 --> 00:51:37,903
Hey!

1019
00:51:47,203 --> 00:51:48,455
Hey.

1020
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:51,583
Did you make this?

1021
00:51:51,666 --> 00:51:53,501
I didn't pack a dress.

1022
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:57,505
You are so annoyingly
good at things.

1023
00:51:57,589 --> 00:52:00,383
Coming from a guy that just
inspired an engagement party

1024
00:52:00,467 --> 00:52:03,887
with a speech pulled from
the deepest recesses
of his own ass.

1025
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:06,306
Oh, this isn't
an engagement party.

1026
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:07,807
What are you talking about?

1027
00:52:09,225 --> 00:52:10,518
It's a birthday party.

1028
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:14,522
I don't do birthdays.

1029
00:52:15,815 --> 00:52:18,443
You also
don't fly on rockets

1030
00:52:18,526 --> 00:52:20,403
or conspire with stowaways.

1031
00:52:20,487 --> 00:52:23,156
I think you just gotta face it.

1032
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:25,283
You're a space criminal now.

1033
00:52:25,367 --> 00:52:26,910
[laughs]

1034
00:52:26,993 --> 00:52:29,162
Now make a wish. And don't wish
to go on a spacewalk with me

1035
00:52:29,245 --> 00:52:31,998
because that's, kind of,
an open-door policy.

1036
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:34,167
Any time. Any time.

1037
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:35,418
Please.

1038
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:37,837
Spacewalk.

1039
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:39,839
[scoffs] My wish.

1040
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,132
You got it.

1041
00:52:43,635 --> 00:52:45,470
Do you wanna get your parents
on a video call?

1042
00:52:47,305 --> 00:52:49,432
My parents died when I was 14.

1043
00:52:51,267 --> 00:52:52,227
What?

1044
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:58,775
I'm so sorry.

1045
00:52:58,858 --> 00:53:00,151
I had no idea.

1046
00:53:01,152 --> 00:53:02,862
Calvin's family took me in.

1047
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:05,532
Well, Jan, actually.

1048
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:10,036
She didn't even hesitate.
It was just,
"Here's your room."

1049
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,538
"What are your favorite meals?"

1050
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:14,791
and "I'm ready to go shopping
whenever you are."

1051
00:53:26,177 --> 00:53:30,432
You know,
Calvin probably wouldn't
go to a party like this.

1052
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:33,685
Okay. I'll go peacefully.

1053
00:53:33,768 --> 00:53:35,395
Just let me have one more song.

1054
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:39,190
No, I mean...
you should be Walt tonight.

1055
00:53:41,192 --> 00:53:43,945
'Cause you miss him so much.

1056
00:53:45,613 --> 00:53:46,698
Come on, Tsukino.

1057
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:52,704
Yeah!

1058
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:02,922
-Oh, my God, it's our room.
-Here we go.

1059
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:04,924
[Cornelia] Ambient
sound control activated.

1060
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:06,634
I should really go
hang up this dress.

1061
00:54:06,718 --> 00:54:07,927
Yeah, let's keep it on.

1062
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:09,512
Think of it like
a really big bib.

1063
00:54:09,596 --> 00:54:13,183
That space wine hits extra hard
with this altitude.

1064
00:54:13,266 --> 00:54:14,976
Oh, my God, Walt.

1065
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:18,521
We are in space,
not high in the sky.

1066
00:54:18,605 --> 00:54:21,399
Do you have any idea
how space works?

1067
00:54:23,443 --> 00:54:25,028
I'm sorry.

1068
00:54:25,111 --> 00:54:29,449
Sometimes you're just so dumb
and it makes me so angry.

1069
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:30,617
I know.

1070
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:34,162
Makes me angry too.

1071
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:41,169
[slurping]

1072
00:54:41,252 --> 00:54:42,921
Gary, can you please
dim the lights?

1073
00:54:45,381 --> 00:54:47,133
I feel like a Hot Pocket.

1074
00:54:56,935 --> 00:54:57,936
Hey.

1075
00:55:02,524 --> 00:55:04,984
What should we do for
my birthday?

1076
00:55:08,029 --> 00:55:10,323
Something
old Sophie couldn't...

1077
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:15,829
but new Sophie can.

1078
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:17,664

00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:21,709
-We're gonna die.
-Eventually.

1082
00:55:21,793 --> 00:55:22,877
In glorious battle.

1083
00:55:22,961 --> 00:55:24,879
-Let's go back inside.
-No.

1084
00:55:27,132 --> 00:55:28,007
Look at me.

1085
00:55:29,217 --> 00:55:30,051
On three.

1086
00:55:30,135 --> 00:55:31,302
What? What on three?

1087
00:55:31,386 --> 00:55:32,762
You know what on three.

1088
00:55:34,139 --> 00:55:35,056
Seriously?

1089
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:37,100
One.

1090

All right.
Listen up, everybody.
Roughly 11 minutes ago,

1120
00:58:58,051 --> 00:59:01,054
our hull was breached by an
unidentified piece of debris.

1121
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:02,889
Our O2 reserves
have been pierced,

1122
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:05,224
so we'll be docking
at the Mars orbital station,

1123
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:07,769
and we'll take
a freight shuttle
to the surface.

1124
00:59:07,852 --> 00:59:09,687
Come with me.

1125
00:59:09,771 --> 00:59:11,731
[Cornelia] Hello, Sophie.

1126
00:59:11,814 --> 00:59:14,150
They're checking IDs at
the Mars database, which is
basically space customs.

1127
00:59:14,233 --> 00:59:15,568
So the moment they scan yours,
they're gonna see that Calvin
is already on Mars.

1128
00:59:15,651 --> 00:59:16,819
Oh, shit.

1129
00:59:16,903 --> 00:59:18,029
Question.

1130
00:59:18,112 --> 00:59:19,447
Do you think you can fit
in my suitcase?

1131
00:59:20,782 --> 00:59:22,533
That feels like
a first draft idea.

1132
00:59:22,617 --> 00:59:24,577
Okay. Well, if you weren't so
gangly then it might work.

1133
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,120
What if we say there
are two Calvins?

1134
00:59:26,204 --> 00:59:27,955
The one on Mars
is already the imposter.

1135
00:59:28,039 --> 00:59:30,208
I could sleep with
Captain Tarter.
I know that I'm her type.

1136

It's like a honeypot scheme.

1137
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:33,419
We know that she's indebted
to me after that point,

1138
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,546
and not because I want to
or anything, but because it,

1139
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:37,131
-you know, would help us--
-Okay, stop.

1194
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,832
[automated voice]
<i>Beginning orbital rotation.</i>

1195
01:02:16,916 --> 01:02:20,086
<i>Estimated time to arrival,</i>
<i>14 hours.</i>

1196
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:27,260
Where to go first?

1197
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:28,928
Wait. Lights.

1198
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,264
Good idea.

1199
01:02:43,568 --> 01:02:45,027
[Sophie] Wow.

1200
01:02:45,111 --> 01:02:46,279
Titan.

1201
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:48,447
Good choice.

1202
01:02:52,785 --> 01:02:54,161
Try Europa.

1203
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,757
I feel like it's staring at me.

1204
01:03:06,841 --> 01:03:08,259
Then look away.

1205
01:03:09,135 --> 01:03:10,303
No.

1206
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:12,597
That's exactly what it wants.

1207
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:15,057
I can tell this is getting
painful for you.

1208
01:03:15,141 --> 01:03:16,350
Yeah.

1209
01:03:20,896 --> 01:03:22,273
Did you just break it?

1210
01:03:22,356 --> 01:03:24,317
No. Just wait.

1211
01:03:30,156 --> 01:03:31,741
It's the beginning.

1212
01:03:33,284 --> 01:03:34,368
Of what?

1213
01:03:39,999 --> 01:03:41,375
[Sophie] Of everything.

1214
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:54,388
[Walt] Are those stars?

1215
01:03:54,472 --> 01:03:58,392
[Sophie] Dark matter collecting
under the force of gravity.

1216
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:05,483
Invisible strings just
pulling everything into place.

1217
01:04:14,659 --> 01:04:17,161
And celestial bodies just...

1218
01:04:19,997 --> 01:04:21,207
follow.

1219
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:35,805
What happened?

1220
01:04:35,888 --> 01:04:38,265
I think
the universe just ended.

1221
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:43,562
-We should...
-I just...

1222
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:44,689
You...

1223
01:04:46,482 --> 01:04:48,067
We should probably
get some sleep.

1224
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:49,527
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1225
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:32,111
"Buy a small country."

1226
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:34,447
"Kidnap Gary from
the coffee shop."

1227
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:35,906
He never leaves.

1228
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:40,161
"Get brain augmenting
chip installed."

1229
01:05:40,244 --> 01:05:42,413
Yeah. I wanna read other
people's minds.

1230
01:05:42,496 --> 01:05:45,750
This is
an impossible checklist.

1231
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:48,335
-I deserve that.
-[chuckles]

1232
01:05:52,256 --> 01:05:53,549
Where are we?

1233
01:05:53,632 --> 01:05:57,511
We are about five minutes
from where I grew up.

1234
01:05:57,595 --> 01:06:00,556
It's basically
an illegal dump site.

1235
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:03,309
My dad used to
bring me out here.

1236
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:04,477
Cool.

1237
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,104
It was so dangerous.

1238
01:06:07,188 --> 01:06:10,024
Like, exposed wires everywhere,
and broken glass,

1239
01:06:10,107 --> 01:06:13,444
and I got electrocuted,
like, 100 times.

1240
01:06:13,527 --> 01:06:15,112
-That's awesome.
-Yeah.

1241
01:06:15,196 --> 01:06:18,491
And it smelled terrible.

1242
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:20,159
Like, so bad.

1243
01:06:21,869 --> 01:06:25,998
We were gonna save the world,
one broken thing at a time.

1244
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:33,130
I loved it.

1245

1247
01:06:42,556 --> 01:06:45,559

1260
01:07:58,173 --> 01:08:01,635

1275
01:08:52,519 --> 01:08:53,520
No.

1276

I'll see you soon.

<i>I'll see you when you land.</i>

1278

Walt.

1279

Huh?

1280
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:43,612
Tell me what you think.

1281
01:09:43,696 --> 01:09:45,864
I'm gonna hide
in one of these storage boxes
with this O2 canister.

1282
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:49,076
When you find me,
in one of the storage units...

1283
01:09:49,159 --> 01:09:50,327
in about...

1284
01:09:51,537 --> 01:09:52,621
two-and-a-half...

1285
01:09:52,705 --> 01:09:54,707
Let's say two hours,
just to be safe.

1286
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:56,458
I can't.

1287
01:09:56,542 --> 01:09:57,668
Are you afraid that
I'm gonna be dead?

1288
01:09:57,751 --> 01:09:59,003
No. Walt.

1289
01:09:59,086 --> 01:10:01,380
Look, if the box smells like
a dead body...

1290
01:10:01,463 --> 01:10:02,464
just keep walking.

1291
01:10:02,548 --> 01:10:04,633
I can't help you anymore.

1292
01:10:09,555 --> 01:10:10,597
I'm sorry.

1293
01:10:13,017 --> 01:10:14,893
But this is my life.

1294
01:10:16,562 --> 01:10:18,480
I can't risk it.

1295
01:10:18,564 --> 01:10:19,732
Calvin...

1296
01:10:21,066 --> 01:10:22,192
is here.

1297
01:10:23,235 --> 01:10:24,570
His family...

1298
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:27,197
My family is here.

1299
01:10:27,281 --> 01:10:28,866
And Ginny is here.

1300
01:10:28,949 --> 01:10:31,618
Stop acting like our situations
are even remotely the same.

1301
01:10:32,453 --> 01:10:33,579
Right.

1302
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:36,248
You're not supposed to be here.

1303
01:10:36,331 --> 01:10:39,126
And you are?
'Cause you can buy a ticket.

1304
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:42,796
That's not fair.

1305
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,089
You know what's not fair?

1306
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:46,467
Try getting this close
to your dreams

1307
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:47,676
and having someone tell you

1308
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,137
you're not good enough
37 times.

1309
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:52,056
Or meeting the girl
of your dreams

1310
01:10:52,139 --> 01:10:54,767
the night before she goes
to another planet,
or having to work...

1311
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:56,018
Wait.

1312
01:10:56,101 --> 01:10:57,561
What?

1313
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:02,191
How long have you
and Ginny been together?

1314
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:04,651
Since freshmen year-ish.

1315
01:11:04,735 --> 01:11:06,361
How "ish"?

1316
01:11:10,324 --> 01:11:13,577
The night before she left
for Mars-ish.

1317
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:14,912
[breathing heavily]

1318
01:11:15,704 --> 01:11:17,122
I'm gonna throw up.

1319
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:18,916
No, don't do that,
'cause then I'm gonna throw up.

1320
01:11:20,292 --> 01:11:23,962
I can't believe
how selfish you are.

1321
01:11:24,046 --> 01:11:26,632
You are so obsessed

1322
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:28,717
with escaping
your average existence

1323
01:11:28,801 --> 01:11:33,347
that you would blow up my life,
her life, for what?

1324
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:35,682
For some sort of adventure?

1325
01:11:35,766 --> 01:11:37,476
For some stupid journal entry?

1326
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:41,188
Sophie, I couldn't blow up
your life if I tried.

1327
01:11:41,271 --> 01:11:42,815
You're living his life.

1328
01:11:42,898 --> 01:11:44,858
[scoffs] That's ridiculous.

1329
01:11:44,942 --> 01:11:46,985
Do you think
he's gonna move for you?

1330
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:49,655
Do you think he's gonna go back
to Earth for you?

1331
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:52,157
That he's not going to get
offered a better job,

1332
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:54,493
and you're gonna go along
with it, like you always do?

1333
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:56,120
You don't know
anything about him.

1334
01:11:56,203 --> 01:11:57,704
I actually do.

1335
01:11:58,705 --> 01:11:59,915
I've had to be him.

1336
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,837
He's never gonna
meet you halfway.

1337
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,880
He's never going to follow you.

1338
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:10,884
You're a coward, Sophie.

1339
01:12:15,389 --> 01:12:17,015
Someday...

1340
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:20,686
when that stupid journal
is filled...

1341
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:23,605
you're gonna flip through it
and realize

1342
01:12:23,689 --> 01:12:27,442
just how pointless it all was.

1343
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:34,283
Sophie...

1344
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:39,955
I'm here because
I am wanted here.

1345
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:54,678
You are here because no one
cares where you are.

Two minutes?

1370
01:15:34,671 --> 01:15:35,839
He's awesome.

1371
01:15:35,922 --> 01:15:36,923
You know what?

1372
01:15:38,008 --> 01:15:39,051
He is awesome.

1373
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:40,218
Wow. [chuckles]

1374
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:45,432
He is also my boyfriend.

1375
01:15:45,515 --> 01:15:48,018
My new boyfriend.

1376
01:15:50,896 --> 01:15:51,730
Oh.

1377
01:15:53,899 --> 01:15:55,192
You're dating my guard?

1378
01:15:55,275 --> 01:15:59,321
You followed me to Mars
after one night.

1379
01:15:59,404 --> 01:16:01,907
Kind of needed to start dating
a security guard.

1380
01:16:05,577 --> 01:16:06,953
Just to be clear...

1381
01:16:08,497 --> 01:16:10,123
you're not here to rescue me?

1382
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:13,001
No.

1383
01:16:13,085 --> 01:16:15,796
But I did bring you
some company.

1384
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:21,760
Ripley?

1385
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:23,678
Oh, my God. Hi.

1386
01:16:23,762 --> 01:16:26,306
What are you doing here?
I thought you were arrested.

1387
01:16:29,101 --> 01:16:30,018
[knocking at door]

1388
01:16:31,061 --> 01:16:31,937
Time to go.

1389
01:16:41,279 --> 01:16:43,615
You'll be okay, Walt.

1390
01:16:43,698 --> 01:16:45,784
I mean, we both know
who you're really in love with.

1391
01:16:48,328 --> 01:16:49,454
Mars.

1392
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:50,372
Mars.

1393
01:16:51,081 --> 01:16:51,998
And you made it.

1394
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:55,252
More or less.

1395
01:17:04,177 --> 01:17:07,097
It says his application
was rejected like
100 times.

1396
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:09,099
-Wow, 100 times?
-37.

1397
01:17:09,182 --> 01:17:12,561
I don't understand why someone
would wanna be somewhere
they do not belong.

1398
01:17:12,644 --> 01:17:14,688
-Yeah, you've got a point.
-Well, I think it's exciting.

1399
01:17:14,771 --> 01:17:17,607
Did you and the stowaway
cross paths, Sophie?

1400
01:17:17,691 --> 01:17:18,900
-No.
-No?

1401
01:17:18,984 --> 01:17:20,944
[laughing] No.
He must've been hiding.

1402
01:17:21,027 --> 01:17:22,946
-Really?
-In the air ducts or something.

1403
01:17:23,029 --> 01:17:25,907
-Wow. Can you just imagine?
-That is so stupid.

1404
01:17:25,991 --> 01:17:28,118
So, any idea what
you're gonna do

1405
01:17:28,201 --> 01:17:29,494
now that you're here?

1406
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:32,080
I recommended her for a spot
on my team.

1407
01:17:32,164 --> 01:17:33,498
What?

1408
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:35,459
Well, they love you for it.

1409
01:17:35,542 --> 01:17:37,502
You're totally qualified
and they're always looking
for young candidates

1410
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:39,171
who can carry out
the next phase.

1411
01:17:39,254 --> 01:17:40,589
The next phase?

1412
01:17:40,672 --> 01:17:42,799
Yeah, the 12-year
life-cycle trials.

1413
01:17:56,855 --> 01:17:58,023
[Leon] Wake up, Walt.

1414
01:18:03,278 --> 01:18:04,196
[purring]

1415
01:18:05,572 --> 01:18:06,781
Did you just talk?

1416
01:18:08,074 --> 01:18:09,409
It's time to go.

1417
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:11,119
Gary?

1418
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,122
Is that you?

1419
01:18:14,206 --> 01:18:16,458
I didn't really think
the cat could talk.

1420
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:28,970
Clear?

1421
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:30,931
[meowing]

1422
01:18:31,515 --> 01:18:32,349
Copy.

1423
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:39,523
[Leon] Come closer.

1424
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:41,441
Hello?

1425
01:18:51,576 --> 01:18:52,661
[meowing]

1426
01:18:53,578 --> 01:18:54,412
Okay.

1427
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:56,331
Ripley.

1428
01:19:13,014 --> 01:19:13,932
[Leon] Hello, Walt.

1429
01:19:18,770 --> 01:19:21,273
Holy shit. It's you.

1430
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:22,649
Leon Kovi.

1431
01:19:22,732 --> 01:19:25,360
I have that same picture
right by my bed.

1432
01:19:25,443 --> 01:19:27,112
That sounded weird.

1433
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:29,948
I've thought about meeting you
for a really, really long time.

1434
01:19:32,409 --> 01:19:33,285
As have I.

1435
01:19:34,119 --> 01:19:35,245
What?

1436
01:19:35,328 --> 01:19:37,122
I have been monitoring
your progress

1437
01:19:37,205 --> 01:19:40,417
since you first entered
that escape pod back on Earth.

1438
01:19:43,795 --> 01:19:44,963
Oh, shit.

1439
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:46,548
[man 1]<i> Bob,</i>
<i>you seeing this kid?</i>

1440
01:19:46,631 --> 01:19:48,133
[man 2]<i> Yep,</i>
<i>kid thinks he's invisible.</i>

1441
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:50,343
You have cameras everywhere?

1442
01:19:50,427 --> 01:19:53,263
[man 1]<i> Bob says,</i>
<i>everybody just act like</i>
<i>you don't see him.</i>

1443
01:19:53,346 --> 01:19:55,181
[Walt] Why didn't
you arrest me?

1444
01:19:55,265 --> 01:19:57,684
Well, I ran a profile
and the risk of you impacting
the journey

1445
01:19:57,767 --> 01:19:59,769
in a meaningful way
was below zero

1446
01:19:59,853 --> 01:20:02,355
which I didn't even think
was mathematically possible,

1447
01:20:02,439 --> 01:20:04,316
but it was,
it was a negative number, Walt.

1448
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:07,652
There was some concern
that you would die
in the air ducts.

1449
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:10,488
And the smell
of your rotting carcass

1450
01:20:10,572 --> 01:20:13,033
might disturb
some of the paying guests.

1451
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:15,035
Bets were made.

1452
01:20:15,744 --> 01:20:16,578
I won.

1453
01:20:20,290 --> 01:20:22,500
That girl had nothing
to do with it.

1454
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:26,671
-Walt!
-She did. But I forced her.
Not, like, forced her.

1455
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:28,214
Blackmail. Light blackmail.

1456
01:20:28,298 --> 01:20:30,467
There is no such thing
as "light blackmail," okay?

1457
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:33,470
There's no diet blackmail.
You blackmailed her, it's fine.

1458
01:20:34,846 --> 01:20:36,723
So, what happens now?

1459
01:20:36,806 --> 01:20:41,394
Well, the board has voted
to write this off
as a security systems test.

1460
01:20:41,478 --> 01:20:43,146
Ship you back to Earth

1461
01:20:43,229 --> 01:20:45,190
and tie you up
in so much legal trouble

1462
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:48,234
that the world at large
will never hear from you again.

1463
01:20:48,318 --> 01:20:50,945
[sighs] Can I at least get
my own escape pod?

1464
01:20:51,863 --> 01:20:54,407
Walt, I hate the board.

1465
01:20:54,491 --> 01:20:56,701
So, I leaked
the security footage.

1466
01:20:56,785 --> 01:20:59,245
I shared your whole journey
with the world.

1467
01:20:59,329 --> 01:21:00,580
Oh. You what?

1468
01:21:00,664 --> 01:21:02,207
[Leon] It's become so popular.

1469
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:04,042
Look how happy it makes people.

1470
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:06,461
I'm told it's called
"Walt-ing."

1471
01:21:06,544 --> 01:21:09,881
She's Walt-ing. He's Walt-ing.
They're all Walt-ing.

1472
01:21:09,964 --> 01:21:11,216
Walt-ing?

1473
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:12,676
I, myself, can't Walt.
I have a bad back.

1474
01:21:12,759 --> 01:21:14,886
But Alan here has Walted.
Haven't you, Alan?

1475
01:21:14,969 --> 01:21:18,223
I am hiding. I am a sneaky,
sneaky human boy.

1476
01:21:18,306 --> 01:21:20,850
It's very, very fresh.

1477
01:21:20,934 --> 01:21:25,980
And now the board
is terrified of a PR backlash.

1478
01:21:26,981 --> 01:21:28,066
Please, sit.

1479
01:21:30,735 --> 01:21:33,154
You remind me
of a young me, Walt.

1480
01:21:33,238 --> 01:21:34,572
Emotionally, that is.

1481
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:36,658
Intellectually,
it's more of an apples to...

1482
01:21:37,951 --> 01:21:39,244
whatever a much
smarter fruit is.

1483
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:40,662
What's a smarter fruit, Walt?

1484
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:43,123
Papaya?

1485
01:21:43,206 --> 01:21:44,999
Papaya! Yes.

1486
01:21:45,083 --> 01:21:46,418
I'm the papaya.

1487
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:48,545
Do you know why the papaya
came to Mars, Walt?

1488
01:21:50,296 --> 01:21:51,589
Taxes?

1489
01:21:51,673 --> 01:21:54,426
No, I'm a billionaire, Walt,
I don't pay taxes.

1490
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:58,054
I bet the papaya came
for the exact same reason
as the simple little apple.

1491
01:21:58,930 --> 01:21:59,764
Love?

1492
01:21:59,848 --> 01:22:02,016
Love? How old are you?

1493
01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:04,185
No.

1494
01:22:04,269 --> 01:22:06,271
You wouldn't settle
for the relentless

1495
01:22:06,354 --> 01:22:09,649
onslaught of the quotidian
that is life on Earth,

1496
01:22:09,733 --> 01:22:11,526
so you came here...

1497
01:22:11,609 --> 01:22:13,445
-[scoffs]
-to Mars.

1498
01:22:13,528 --> 01:22:16,364
This is not just a playground
for the wealthy, Walt.

1499
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:20,618
It's a continuation
of our species' rich history

1500
01:22:20,702 --> 01:22:25,957
of curiosity and exploration.

1501
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:30,754
Now, we need the public
and our investors
to understand that.

1502
01:22:30,837 --> 01:22:32,714
I think that you and I

1503
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:34,674
could help each other.

1504
01:22:35,425 --> 01:22:38,344
You, a barista.

1505
01:22:38,428 --> 01:22:39,512
Assistant barista.

1506
01:22:39,596 --> 01:22:41,639
A barista's assistant.

1507
01:22:42,557 --> 01:22:44,476
Unremarkable in every way.

1508
01:22:44,559 --> 01:22:47,562
Truly middle of-the-road,
by all metrics.

1509
01:22:47,645 --> 01:22:48,813
Okay, I got it.

1510
01:22:48,897 --> 01:22:51,900
Stowing away
for an historic journey

1511
01:22:52,734 --> 01:22:54,736
against impossible odds,

1512
01:22:54,819 --> 01:22:57,238
secretly facilitated by me,
of course,

1513
01:22:57,322 --> 01:23:02,243
to discover something
that just might make
his meaningless little life

1514
01:23:02,327 --> 01:23:06,956
just a smidgeon,
just a tickle more meaningful.

1515
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:11,544
Now, that is a story
people wanna hear, Walt.

1516
01:23:13,797 --> 01:23:14,839
Oh, what's this?

1517
01:23:18,259 --> 01:23:19,969
Walt, this has your name on it.

1518
01:23:20,053 --> 01:23:21,846
-This is a contract.
-Contract?

1519
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:23,765
Ceding control of your likeness

1520
01:23:23,848 --> 01:23:26,684
to Kovi Industries
for exclusive use

1521
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:28,353
in promotional materials

1522
01:23:28,436 --> 01:23:30,688
in perpetuity across
all universes,
known and unknown.

1523
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:32,023
And in exchange...

1524
01:23:33,566 --> 01:23:34,692
you may stay here.

1525
01:23:35,693 --> 01:23:37,362
Are you serious?

1526
01:23:37,445 --> 01:23:38,988

1540
01:25:08,411 --> 01:25:10,496
Sure. Dozens of times over.

1541
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:13,958
But don't you think it's better

-Sure.
-Yes, I agree.

1546

[Walt] Hey, Gary.

1555
01:25:52,413 --> 01:25:53,831
What are they doing down there?

1556
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:56,334
Preparing the return vessel
for launch.

1557
01:25:56,417 --> 01:25:58,670
At the conclusion
of each orbital cycle,

1558
01:25:58,753 --> 01:26:02,548
the humans celebrate
their domination
of this lifeless planet.

1559
01:26:02,632 --> 01:26:04,092
After the festivities,

1560
01:26:04,175 --> 01:26:07,178
broken objects of little value
are sent back to Earth

1561
01:26:07,261 --> 01:26:09,347
for long-term storage.

1562
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:11,099
You mean, garbage?

1563
01:26:11,933 --> 01:26:13,309
Yes.

1564
01:26:13,393 --> 01:26:14,686
Like sexual reproduction,

1565
01:26:14,769 --> 01:26:17,605
making garbage brings humans
great happiness.

1566
01:26:17,689 --> 01:26:20,358
But looking at it
causes deep shame.

1567
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:22,402
It must be hidden.

1568
01:26:24,529 --> 01:26:27,824
Are we supposed to be here?

1569
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:30,451
No.

1570
01:26:30,535 --> 01:26:34,372
I have asked you to return
to the habitat 11 times.

1571
01:26:34,455 --> 01:26:35,373
All right, Gary.

1572
01:26:36,249 --> 01:26:37,250
You win.

1573
01:26:37,333 --> 01:26:38,459
I am Victor.

01:26:55,893 --> 01:26:56,853
[chuckles softly]

1575
01:27:06,195 --> 01:27:08,322
Hey, Ga... Victor?

1576
01:27:08,406 --> 01:27:09,407
Yes, Walt?

1577
01:27:11,909 --> 01:27:13,244
I'm gonna need some tools.

1578
01:27:17,665 --> 01:27:20,043
I don't even understand
why you wanna go to this thing.

1579
01:27:21,878 --> 01:27:23,755
It's the return party.

1580
01:27:23,838 --> 01:27:25,006
It's gonna be fun.

1581
01:27:25,089 --> 01:27:27,175
Plus, you can't work
all the time.

1582
01:27:27,967 --> 01:27:29,761
Which reminds me,

1583
01:27:29,844 --> 01:27:31,763
when can I tell them
you can start?

1584
01:27:33,056 --> 01:27:33,931
Start what?

1585
01:27:35,892 --> 01:27:37,393
The job.

1586
01:27:37,477 --> 01:27:38,978
With my team.

1587
01:27:39,062 --> 01:27:40,938
I don't know
if it's the right fit.

1588
01:27:43,775 --> 01:27:44,609
Um...

1589
01:27:48,362 --> 01:27:51,783
It's the perfect fit.

1590
01:27:51,866 --> 01:27:53,534
I mean, it's the same schedule.

1591
01:27:53,618 --> 01:27:56,037
I still have to finish
my thesis anyway so...

1592
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:58,122
Yes, I know,

1593
01:27:58,206 --> 01:28:02,085
but, well,
you don't need it anymore.

1594
01:28:02,168 --> 01:28:03,461
You're here.

1595
01:28:03,544 --> 01:28:05,379
You have a job offer.

1596
01:28:05,463 --> 01:28:09,300
You can graduate without it.
You know, it's the past.

1597
01:28:09,383 --> 01:28:10,468
It's not the past.

1598
01:28:12,845 --> 01:28:14,180
It's supposed to be the future.

1599
01:28:16,099 --> 01:28:17,058
My future.

1600
01:28:25,274 --> 01:28:26,526
[upbeat music playing]

1601
01:28:33,282 --> 01:28:34,492
Yeah, no.

1602
01:28:35,159 --> 01:28:36,452
Good stuff, guys.

1603
01:28:37,954 --> 01:28:40,373
Shoot me in the face.
That is getting old.

1604
01:28:40,456 --> 01:28:44,085
Oh! It almost came
to that, honey, trust.

1605
01:28:44,168 --> 01:28:48,339
I voted to eject you,
but Kovi, he's a softy.

1606
01:28:48,422 --> 01:28:50,216
You knew the whole time too?

1607
01:28:50,299 --> 01:28:52,927
Walt, I have an IQ of 165

1608
01:28:53,010 --> 01:28:56,139
and I can pilot
a four billion-dollar
spaceship--

1609
01:28:56,222 --> 01:28:59,475
Through an asteroid belt. Yeah.

1610
01:28:59,559 --> 01:29:00,601
I'm sorry.

1611
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:03,146
It's okay.

1612
01:29:04,188 --> 01:29:08,276
So, how you enjoying Mars?

1613
01:29:08,359 --> 01:29:11,779
Honestly, I thought
it would be different.

1614
01:29:11,863 --> 01:29:13,614
I thought that I would get here

1615
01:29:13,698 --> 01:29:16,951
and I would be changed
or something.

1616
01:29:17,034 --> 01:29:20,288
But now I'm here
and it's exactly the same.

1617
01:29:21,998 --> 01:29:25,251
Walt, it doesn't matter
how far you travel,

1618
01:29:25,334 --> 01:29:27,003
you can never escape yourself.

1619
01:29:29,297 --> 01:29:31,340
Did you just come up with that?

1620
01:29:31,424 --> 01:29:34,510
No, bitch.
That is a very common phrase.

1621
01:29:34,594 --> 01:29:36,721
-How have you not heard
that before?
-Never heard it.

1622

'cause you dumb.

1623

do you remember how I told you,
you could stay?

1688
01:34:34,727 --> 01:34:35,853
Yeah?

1689
01:34:35,936 --> 01:34:37,605
Well, we just finished
the first run

1690
01:34:37,688 --> 01:34:40,024
of our new campaign
and there's been
a change of plans.

1691
01:34:40,107 --> 01:34:40,983
Seriously?

1692
01:34:42,735 --> 01:34:45,863
Can I please just have
my own escape pod?

1693
01:34:45,946 --> 01:34:49,617
How about
your very own spaceship?

1694
01:34:50,451 --> 01:34:51,327
What?

1695
01:34:51,410 --> 01:34:53,037
We're sending you to Ceres.

1696
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,039
It's a tiny,
little dwarf planet

1697
01:34:55,122 --> 01:34:58,083
in the main asteroid belt
between us and Jupiter.

1698
01:34:58,167 --> 01:35:01,045
And you are gonna be
the very first person

1699
01:35:01,128 --> 01:35:02,880
to ever set foot on her.

1700
01:35:04,006 --> 01:35:05,716
Again, what?

1701
01:35:05,799 --> 01:35:07,134
We've set up an outpost.

1702
01:35:07,218 --> 01:35:09,261
And it's time
for a ribbon cutting.

1703
01:35:09,345 --> 01:35:12,097
You're gonna set up the ribbon,
you're gonna cut the ribbon.

1704
01:35:12,181 --> 01:35:14,558
It's gonna be very exciting.
We want you there.

1705
01:35:14,642 --> 01:35:17,186
That's... That's amazing.
Thank you.

1706
01:35:17,269 --> 01:35:18,103
Hmm.

1707
01:35:19,813 --> 01:35:21,190
But, why me?

1708
01:35:24,735 --> 01:35:27,905
-Can I be honest with you?
-Yeah.

1709
01:35:27,988 --> 01:35:31,408
People cannot get over
how average you are.

1710
01:35:31,492 --> 01:35:33,410
It's like a superpower
or something, [chuckles]

1711
01:35:33,494 --> 01:35:34,578
I don't know what it is.

1712
01:35:34,662 --> 01:35:36,372
They look at you,
and they think,

1713
01:35:36,455 --> 01:35:38,415
"If this guy can do it,

1714
01:35:38,499 --> 01:35:41,085
then I can do
literally anything."

1715
01:35:43,879 --> 01:35:45,089
I'll take it.

1716
01:35:45,172 --> 01:35:47,091
Great. Good choice.

1717
01:35:47,174 --> 01:35:50,594
Listen, you should
probably get in touch
with your family, friends

1718
01:35:50,678 --> 01:35:52,346
or anyone
who's important to you,

1719
01:35:52,429 --> 01:35:54,348
'cause you're not gonna
see them for a few years.

1720
01:35:54,431 --> 01:35:55,891
[phone ringing]

1721
01:35:55,975 --> 01:35:57,268
I gotta take this. Sorry, Walt.

1722
01:35:57,851 --> 01:35:58,936
Hello.

1723
01:35:59,019 --> 01:36:00,521
Yeah, I just ran it by him.

1724
01:36:00,604 --> 01:36:02,982
Yeah, he's happy.
He's super happy.

1725
01:36:03,065 --> 01:36:04,650
It'll be an adventure.

1726
01:36:04,733 --> 01:36:06,068
He's gonna be like
the Little Prince.
He'll be great.

1727
01:36:08,195 --> 01:36:09,363
Hey, Alan?

1728
01:36:09,446 --> 01:36:11,240
Yes, Walt.

1729
01:36:11,323 --> 01:36:12,950
Could you place a call
for me, please?

1730
01:36:13,033 --> 01:36:15,744
Of course.
Who would you like me to call?

1731
01:36:18,205 --> 01:36:19,290
Sophie Tsukino.

1732
01:36:20,624 --> 01:36:22,001
I'm sorry.

1733
01:36:22,084 --> 01:36:25,129
Sophie Tsukino is no longer
registered as a resident.

1734
01:36:25,212 --> 01:36:26,755
What?

1735
01:36:26,839 --> 01:36:30,634
She is the sole passenger
on today's return shuttle
to Earth.

1736
01:36:30,718 --> 01:36:34,013
My records indicate
she has already boarded
the ship.

1737
01:37:14,970 --> 01:37:16,180
[sighs softly]

1738
01:37:16,263 --> 01:37:18,682
[Walt] Oh, it stinks in here.

1739
01:37:18,766 --> 01:37:20,809
This ship smells so bad.

1740
01:37:21,894 --> 01:37:23,520
Walt.

1741
01:37:23,604 --> 01:37:25,189
Actually it makes sense.
It's literally filled
with garbage.

1742
01:37:25,272 --> 01:37:27,358
Sir, that seat is for
authorized personnel only.

1743
01:37:27,441 --> 01:37:29,485
I know, I'm sorry. Okay.

1744
01:37:29,568 --> 01:37:31,070
Wait, how do I...

1745
01:37:31,153 --> 01:37:33,197
-It's the button directly--
-I can't see.

1746
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:35,157
-Sorry.
-Just hold the button.
No, no, no.

1747
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:37,242
Just hold the down button.
The same thing you did
to get here.

1748
01:37:37,326 --> 01:37:40,663
I got it. Sorry. I got it.
[laughing]

1749
01:37:47,086 --> 01:37:48,128
Expect a fine.

1750
01:37:49,922 --> 01:37:50,756
Really?

1751
01:37:57,805 --> 01:37:58,681
Walt?

1752
01:37:59,848 --> 01:38:00,724
Sophie?

1753
01:38:01,809 --> 01:38:02,893
What are you doing here?

1754
01:38:05,646 --> 01:38:06,730
I'm following you.

1755
01:38:10,693 --> 01:38:12,152
Back to Earth.

1756
01:38:12,236 --> 01:38:14,363
Even though
I didn't invite you,

1757
01:38:14,446 --> 01:38:17,533
or even tell you I was leaving.

1758
01:38:17,616 --> 01:38:19,868
Making it
all the more romantic?

1759
01:38:19,952 --> 01:38:23,956
You literally did
the exact same thing
for another girl last month.

1760
01:38:24,039 --> 01:38:25,416
Okay, yes.

1761
01:38:25,499 --> 01:38:29,211
I did recently travel across
the universe for love.

1762
01:38:29,294 --> 01:38:31,338
No, no, not love.

1763
01:38:31,422 --> 01:38:32,715
You barely knew that girl.

1764
01:38:34,758 --> 01:38:36,093
Correct.

1765
01:38:36,176 --> 01:38:37,511
But I do know you.

1766
01:38:37,594 --> 01:38:41,974
You're the most
frustratingly, brilliantly,

1767
01:38:42,057 --> 01:38:43,851
-contradictorily...
-Not a word.

1768
01:38:43,934 --> 01:38:46,687
...annoyingly talented person
I've ever met.

1769
01:38:46,770 --> 01:38:51,442
Every time I'm with you,
you make me feel so dumb.

1770
01:38:51,525 --> 01:38:52,651
[chuckles]

1771
01:38:52,735 --> 01:38:54,486
In the best way possible.

1772
01:38:56,029 --> 01:39:01,410
I'd rather be Mars's garbage
flying back to Earth

1773
01:39:01,493 --> 01:39:04,913
than boring old Walt,

1774
01:39:04,997 --> 01:39:07,166
flipping rocks on Mars alone.

1775
01:39:10,461 --> 01:39:13,297
So you're really gonna
give up this whole
Mars adventure thing?

1776
01:39:16,175 --> 01:39:17,885
I'm not giving up anything.

1777
01:39:19,553 --> 01:39:20,721
You're the adventure.

1778
01:39:22,598 --> 01:39:24,683
Ah! Goddammit.

1779
01:39:25,476 --> 01:39:26,310
What?

1780
01:39:31,273 --> 01:39:33,734
You come in here
with no plan at all

1781
01:39:33,817 --> 01:39:37,112
just expecting everything
to magically work out

1782
01:39:37,196 --> 01:39:38,280
and then somehow,

1783
01:39:38,363 --> 01:39:40,908
you pull that line
out of your ass?

1784
01:39:44,077 --> 01:39:44,912
Yeah.

1785
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:47,831
You are so annoying.

1786
01:39:47,915 --> 01:39:48,749
