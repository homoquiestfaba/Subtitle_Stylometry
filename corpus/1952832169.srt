1
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,870
Thank you, Detective.

2
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,570
- Any change?
- Nothing since you left.

3
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,390
She seems to be looking for something.

4
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,050
Camera?

5
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,140
She has a nice ass.

6
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,820
Stay focused on the mission.

7
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:15,280
Keep an eye on her,
but don't get too close.

8
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,810
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

9
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,160
What can I get for you?

10
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,280
Tea with milk and fresh orange juice..

11
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,780
- ...and a croissant with butter.
- I've already attended to it.

12
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,110
- Thank you.
- No problem.

13
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,700
- Say again?
- She's drinking her tea!

14
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,250
- Can I get you a tea, sir?
- No, no thank you.

15
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,180
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

16
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,930
- I'm looking for Elise Ward.
- Ward, the lady.

17
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,520
Okay, thanks.

18
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,300
- Good morning. Elise Ward?
- Yes, that's me.

19
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,620
I have a letter for you.

20
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,950
She's talking to someone.

21
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,630
A delivery boy.

22
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,230
Scotland Yard, London.

23
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,890
No, it's okay.
It is a gift, you can keep it.

24
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,350
Thank you.

25
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,080
- Here you go, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

26
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:26,970
Get him.

27
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,560
Let's move.

28
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,270
Sir, sir! Sir, we are police.

29
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,690
- What did I do?
- You're under arrest.

30
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,630
- You're coming with us.
- What did I do?

31
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,570
What are you arresting me for?

32
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,730
Go, now!

33
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,440
- No, stop! Police!
- What happened?

34
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,050
The road's too narrow,
we have to go around.  Quick!

35
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,380
Turn right!
Quick, go!

36
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,340
Let's go

37
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,850
Police. Make way!

38
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:50,970
- Can I take your picture?
- Sure.

39
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,980
Memorize this face.

40
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,530
The train arrives in 10 minutes
Stop him when he descends.

41
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:17,590
Arrival at train station Venezia Santa
Lucia in 10 minutes. End of the line.

42
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,900
Yes?

43
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,460
Received.

44
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:41,960
Abort. We go back to HQ quickly.

45
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,500
On the other side.

46
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,740
Damn.

47
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,690
Welcome to Venice, Madam.

48
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,020
Thank you.

49
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,800
Thank you.

50
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,100
Hello, Welcome to Hotel Danieli, Madam.

51
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,990
- Is that clear?
- Let's go.

52
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,320
Excuse me, sir. Good morning.

53
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:28,870
- I'm not sure he's Pierce.
- The boss warned us about this.

54
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,820
Get him!

55
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,490
- Hello, please help.
- Hello, sir.

56
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:30,130
The boss wants him alive!

57
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,670
She's returned.

58
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,890
Get ready to intervene.

59
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:44,250
- Look at that man!
- What the hell?

60
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:50,390
Center, send someone to the market!

61
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:54,830
There is a nut trying to kill himself.
American, I bet.

62
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:00,310
Stop, stop!

63
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,360
Do not jump!

64
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,460
- I'm so sorry.
- Asshole!

65
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:29,160
- Stop him
- I'm sorry, sorry!

66
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:56,640
- Answer the phone.
- Yes, sir.

67
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:56,670
- Ah, wonderful!
- No, no.

68
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:18,220
They placed a... how do you say...
A bounty on your head.

69
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:50,500
Do not shoot him!

70
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,940
It suits you perfectly, sir
You have a wonderful figure.

71
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:35,530
- You think it's a little loose?
- No, it's of the utmost magnificence

72
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,060
14 Red, bet made.

73
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:47,410
Wager, sir?

74
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,810
42 Red.

75
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:58,200
- They're back.
- Yeah, bring them in.

76
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:03,920
Hello Madam.

77
01:12:57,510 --> 01:12:59,180
Ms. Ward's boarding the boat.

78
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:53,710
The Commissioner wants a report.

79
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:16,960
Please?

80
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:03,090
We're here.

81
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:11,160
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

82
01:22:08,350 --> 01:22:10,650
In my opinion she knows nothing.

83
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:49,180
Yes, go!

84
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:44,910
No, knife.

85
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:54,180
- Order the shot.

86
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:10,400
This is the man that
was driving the boat.
