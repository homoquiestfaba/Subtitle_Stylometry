1
00:02:01,809 --> 00:02:04,687
Today is a good day to die.

2
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:10,641
- What's happening?
- It's crack. Get some help.

3
00:02:10,809 --> 00:02:13,881
Crackheads take up all our time.

4
00:02:14,529 --> 00:02:18,124
- What have we got?
- Hemmorage.

5
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:25,400
- Vaginal bleeding.
- Probably a street abortion.

6
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:29,721
- We've got to open her up.
- All the O. R.'s are full.

7
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:34,405
- We can't wait. I'll operate.
- You can't!

8
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:39,359
Just do it! Get him out of here.

9
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:46,168
15 years on the job and you're
gonna get me canned in one day.

10
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:49,401
Here we go.

11
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,480
Forceps!

12
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:54,641
Where is it? Clamp!

13
00:02:54,809 --> 00:02:59,360
- You got her.
- All right, I've got her.

14
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:02,202
Dave, get out of here. Now!

15
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:08,682
Labraccio!
What the hell are you doing?

16
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:30,640
Randall Steckle,
"Diary of a Surgeon." No.

17
00:03:30,809 --> 00:03:35,678
Randall Steckle,
"Diary of a Surgeon to be."

18
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:39,398
Randall Steckle,
"Making of a..."

19
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:43,801
"Forging of a Surgeon."
No, pretentious.

20
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:48,440
Randall Steckle, "Genesis"?

21
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:55,159
"Genesis of a Young Surgeon."
Brilliant!

22
00:04:10,809 --> 00:04:13,528
Morning.

23
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:18,401
Nice work. Keep it up.

24
00:04:23,249 --> 00:04:25,729
Suddenly, even though
I was in a coma, I saw myself.

25
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:29,358
Suddenly, even though
I was in a coma, I saw myself.

26
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,639
Like, from above, looking down.

27
00:04:34,489 --> 00:04:39,119
Ralph, my husband, was crying.

28
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:43,328
The doctor was saying I was dying.

29
00:04:43,489 --> 00:04:47,641
I saw myself in the bed
and everything.

30
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:51,918
I started to float out
into the hall.

31
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:58,642
Then into this tunnel
toward this light.

32
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:03,878
It was the most beautiful light
I ever saw.

33
00:05:04,049 --> 00:05:08,008
I heard this voice.

34
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:13,038
It was the most beautiful voice
I ever heard.

35
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:16,565
And it said:

36
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:20,358
"I'm going to take your baby."

37
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:26,484
"But you are going back."

38
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:34,485
And I woke up, and there
was Ralph and the doctor.

39
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:40,918
I was legally dead
for 41/2 minutes.

40
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:45,685
But I didn't see no tunnel
and I didn't see no light.

41
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:50,001
I did... and it was so beautiful!

42
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:54,560
- I was in this garden...
- This tunnel and this light...

43
00:05:54,729 --> 00:06:00,361
Then this guide...
and a chariot and music.

44
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:04,761
Terry, I think they'd better
get you off medication.

45
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:08,842
Thanks.

46
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:14,366
- What's up?
- Good morning.

47
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:18,124
There's trouble in E. R.
You'd better watch your ass.

48
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:21,838
Why are you always asking
the patients about death?

49
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:25,684
I'll be late for class.
Thanks, Edna.

50
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:33,438
The spoils of arthritis. Some rather
resilient inflammatory tissue here.

51
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:40,082
We're now under the transverse arch
of the foot. The metatarsals...

52
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:45,039
Brilliant, Dr. Steckle. Bring all
that talent with you tonight.

53
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:51,205
Nelson, about tonight. I like you.
I have to decline on moral grounds.

54
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:56,841
There enough atrocity in the world
without your own little horror.

55
00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:02,288
It's ignorance we fear. When did
truth and knowledge become a horror?

56
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:07,125
Especially to a scientist
and a genius like yourself.

57
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:18,758
- How are you doing, Mannus?
- Fine.

58
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:23,078
I've been meaning to ask you,
are you dating anyone?

59
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:27,037
- Identify.
- Costodiaphragmatic recess.

60
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:30,087
Is it offensive
if I make conversation?

61
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:35,243
Sometimes it's nice to open up.
Like old Lenny here, he's open.

62
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:39,197
- Identify.
- Pylorus.

63
00:07:39,369 --> 00:07:43,078
I've heard all the rumours and
nicknames about you, Rachel.

64
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:48,118
I'm sure you're a very warm woman.
Not in the least bit repressed.

65
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:53,043
- Identify.
- Your brains.

66
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:58,164
You want to come over to my place?

67
00:07:58,329 --> 00:08:04,962
Dr. Hurley,
I need a word with Dr. Mannus.

68
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:09,042
- I already said no to this.
- Steckle and Hurley are in.

69
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:12,201
Two of the top
GPA's in the school.

70
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:15,600
I need you to handle the injections
and the I.V.

71
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:20,240
I have no interest
in watching you kill yourself.

72
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:23,003
I think you do.

73
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:27,606
Good morning, class.
Today's exam will be scaled.

74
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:31,125
Three A's will be given,
five B's and ten C's.

75
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:34,281
The remaining four
will get D's and F's.

76
00:08:35,609 --> 00:08:41,844
As in life, you're competing not
with me, yourself or this exam, -

77
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:45,763
- but with each other.

78
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:50,286
There are a lot of others who'd
like to make a name for themselves.

79
00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:54,920
It's a shame that the people with
the ability don't have the nerve.

80
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:58,968
- All right, we'll be there.
- Speak for yourself, Joseph.

81
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:03,600
Sure, it'll be dramatic, Nelson.
You'll cry or faint, puke at best.

82
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:07,648
But then what?
I don't think you have the balls.

83
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:12,439
You just bring the equipment.
I'll bring my balls.

84
00:09:12,609 --> 00:09:14,725
Did you hear about Labraccio?

85
00:09:18,369 --> 00:09:22,044
Dave, it's a four-month suspension.
It won't affect your scholarship.

86
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:24,598
Forget it, I'm out of here.

87
00:09:25,729 --> 00:09:31,122
You're the best they've ever had.
They won't let you walk away.

88
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:35,601
- Besides, you were wrong.
- No, damn it! She was dying.

89
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:38,886
I saved her life.
What would you have done?

90
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:45,238
They have to make an example out of
you to protect their insurance bond.

91
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:47,718
They'll take you back next term.

92
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:51,086
It doesn't matter.
I'd do the same thing again.

93
00:09:51,249 --> 00:09:56,403
I know you would.
That's why I need you there tonight.

94
00:09:56,569 --> 00:10:00,562
There are a few people I'd like
to kill, but you're not one of them.

95
00:10:00,729 --> 00:10:04,358
I don't want to die.

96
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:09,967
I want to come back with the answers
to death... and life.

97
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:12,563
I can get there with the others...

98
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:18,599
...but I need you.
I need you to bring me back. Please.

99
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:25,566
I'm sorry, man, I can't do that.

100
00:10:26,169 --> 00:10:31,448
Just walk away, Dave.
Go climb a mountain.

101
00:10:31,609 --> 00:10:35,921
I don't understand you any more.
You burn your career on a stranger.

102
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:39,445
Now you turn your back
on a friend.

103
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:54,399
Look, I'm real sorry
about what happened today.

104
00:10:55,569 --> 00:11:01,405
- I won't make it back without you.
- So don't do it.

105
00:11:11,849 --> 00:11:14,682
Dave...

106
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:19,324
What if it works?

107
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:53,647
I don't want to be buried
on Saturday.

108
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:58,485
It costs $150 more
to be buried on Saturday.

109
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:03,405
Mrs. Amsler,
you're doing much better.

110
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:49,562
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

111
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:51,447
<i>I know you're home.</i>

112
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:55,284
- <i>Don't be late. Bring the camera.</i>
- What camera?

113
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:11,761
- Thank God he called a specialist.
- No lectures, okay?

114
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:14,648
You're engaged. Grow up.

115
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:19,599
I'm recording a few last adventures
before resigning myself to monogamy.

116
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:24,889
I didn't realise. I thought
you were just a pussy marauder.

117
00:14:27,609 --> 00:14:32,444
What the hell are we doing here?
This is goodbye med-school.

118
00:14:32,609 --> 00:14:36,397
Ten bucks says he shits his drawers
and we're out of here.

119
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:40,881
Not those lights.
Security will come running.

120
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:44,724
Set up over the grate.
I just got the boiler going.

121
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:48,928
- You're really going to do this?
- Just humour the man.

122
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:53,287
Take me down with nitrous,
sodium pentathol and a cold blanket.

123
00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:55,917
I've got some chilled D5W.

124
00:14:56,089 --> 00:15:01,641
When my temperature is 86°,
hit me with 200 joules.

125
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:05,848
The shock will stop my heart.
Then take my mask off.

126
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:10,127
- You said Rachel was coming.
- Steckle, shut the door.

127
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:13,725
You handle the injections.

128
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:18,041
When the EEG flatlines, the brain
is dead. I'll be exploring.

129
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:23,806
Give me 30 seconds. Set the blanket
to warm and take me up to 93°.

130
00:15:23,969 --> 00:15:28,918
Inject 1 cc of adrenalin,
and Joe, come in with the defibs.

131
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:33,446
- You bring me back to life.
- With brain damage.

132
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:39,007
Resembling in many ways...
a Cabbage Patch doll.

133
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:43,242
Not with a body temperature of 86°.

134
00:15:45,489 --> 00:15:49,767
Dr. Mannus,
will you handle the injections?

135
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:58,687
Wait a minute. Quite simply,
why are you doing this?

136
00:15:58,849 --> 00:16:01,886
To see if there's anything
beyond death.

137
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:04,927
Philosophy failed. Religion failed.

138
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:09,879
Now it's up to physical science.
Mankind deserves to know.

139
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:12,882
You're doing this for mankind?

140
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:17,008
This letter absolves you
of any responsibility.

141
00:16:17,169 --> 00:16:20,844
This isn't for mankind.
You want to get on "60 Minutes" -

142
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:24,638
- sandwiched between Andy Rooney
and the commercials.

143
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:29,519
"Tonight, a medical student who
experienced death and came back."

144
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:34,205
- Fame is inevitable.
- That's the wrong reason.

145
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:39,841
Dr. Hurley, electrodes. Don't you
want to be on "60 Minutes"?

146
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:49,040
Rachel, how about a little nitrous?
At least I'll go out with a laugh.

147
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:55,282
Dr. Hurley, get the blanket.

148
00:16:58,489 --> 00:17:02,801
We're all professionals.
I'm sure this'll go very smoothly.

149
00:17:02,969 --> 00:17:05,802
Can I have your apartment?

150
00:17:05,969 --> 00:17:09,484
- It's a joke!
- One minute.

151
00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:14,484
Don't be late. Start filming now.

152
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:18,005
You'll have a complete record
of the experiment.

153
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:22,162
Promise me
you'll go through with this.

154
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:32,282
One little kiss goodbye.

155
00:17:32,449 --> 00:17:36,078
I'll see you soon.

156
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:48,278
- 96°.
- This letter doesn't mean shit.

157
00:17:48,449 --> 00:17:54,524
Let him sleep. He'll have a wet
dream and think he went to heaven.

158
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:59,558
- Now I know why I'm here.
- I've stated my feelings, goodbye.

159
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:04,439
Are you willing to risk your future
for Nelson's fame?

160
00:18:06,449 --> 00:18:09,122
Someone's coming!

161
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:16,878
- Is he dead?
- He's only sleeping.

162
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:19,609
Talk some sense into these people.

163
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:24,240
I'll do it.
I've got nothing to lose.

164
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:27,367
- Just his life!
- I can get him back.

165
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:32,080
- Just stop his heart for a minute.
- Don't think I couldn't have.

166
00:18:37,689 --> 00:18:40,567
No!

167
00:18:40,729 --> 00:18:44,563
- Clear.
- What are you doing?

168
00:18:44,729 --> 00:18:48,244
- A systole.
- You're killing him.

169
00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:52,527
- No wonder you got tossed.
- Stop this shit.

170
00:18:52,689 --> 00:18:58,480
I did not come to medical school
to murder my classmates!

171
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:05,408
Flatline.

172
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:12,164
They're getting smaller. He's dying.

173
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:17,199
- Brain death. Now it's real.
- Start filming.

174
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:22,318
He's dead, isn't that enough?
Let me try to bring him back.

175
00:19:22,489 --> 00:19:28,928
- Just watch the door.
- We're in the room with a dead man.

176
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:34,959
- One minute to go.
- Start filming!

177
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:17,878
- 30 seconds to go.
- Okay, let's heat him up.

178
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:44,967
- 20 seconds. 89°, 90°...
- Sodium bicarbonate ready.

179
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,765
I'm charging the paddles.

180
00:20:55,329 --> 00:20:59,004
Monitor the EKG.

181
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:05,486
- Body temp: 93°.
- Here we go.

182
00:21:10,849 --> 00:21:14,478
- What have we got?
- Not a goddamn thing.

183
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:17,766
Up me to 300.

184
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:27,759
Begin CPR.

185
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:32,764
Sodium bicarbonate and eppy.

186
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:36,126
My God!

187
00:21:41,889 --> 00:21:44,847
Not a goddamn thing!

188
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:48,888
- 98°.
- Hit him again. 350.

189
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:54,167
Nothing.

190
00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:01,047
Got him!

191
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:04,565
- Steckle, help me.
- More eppy.

192
00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:09,766
In.

193
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,848
We got REM.

194
00:22:30,129 --> 00:22:35,283
- Nelson, can you hear us?
- Welcome back, man.

195
00:22:35,449 --> 00:22:42,002
- The crazy motherfucker did it!
- Jesus Christ!

196
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:47,289
Steckle, that's some bedside manner.
You'll make one hell of a doctor.

197
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,407
Suck me.

198
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:46,887
Can you recall any specific emotion?
Heat, cold, anything like that?

199
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:51,725
- You can't be specific.
- Did you see a tunnel of light?

200
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:57,407
No, but there is something
out there. It's comforting.

201
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:00,766
Have you any idea how big this is?

202
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:05,127
He could use some air.
You guys could get us some fluids.

203
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:10,238
- Thanks for saving my life.
- It was so much fun.

204
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:17,844
- How do you feel, wise one?
- Like a highly-tuned instrument.

205
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:21,684
Can you hear the traffic
on the lake shore?

206
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:30,004
Underneath that there's a hum.
It's the street lights.

207
00:24:31,689 --> 00:24:37,719
Even fainter... I can hear
a kind of dragging sound.

208
00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:42,888
- And it's getting louder.
- No.

209
00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:47,758
I not only hear it, I can feel it.

210
00:24:48,969 --> 00:24:54,646
Yeah, your prognosis is excellent.
You'll be great on "60 Minutes".

211
00:24:54,809 --> 00:25:00,566
- It's bigger than that, David.
- I'm sure you'll see to that.

212
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:05,919
- You're not buying any of this.
- You forgot... I'm an atheist.

213
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:10,884
Are you all right for a few minutes?

214
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:17,889
- How's he doing?
- He thinks he's back from the dead.

215
00:25:17,889 --> 00:25:23,407
- How's he doing?
- He thinks he's back from the dead.

216
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:27,926
- That's what we did, right?
- All we did was get lucky.

217
00:25:28,089 --> 00:25:33,686
- I would like to go next.
- Yeah, I'd like to be famous, too.

218
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:38,001
- It's not about fame.
- They'll build monuments to you.

219
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:42,321
- Small stone ones. "Rest in Peace."
- I'm going next.

220
00:25:42,489 --> 00:25:46,243
I'd be willing to go
1 minute 20 seconds.

221
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,324
1:30.

222
00:25:50,489 --> 00:25:56,007
Are you two so competitive that
you're willing to bet your lives?

223
00:25:57,209 --> 00:26:00,406
1:30.

224
00:26:00,569 --> 00:26:05,359
That's it then. Not a bad price
to pay for fame and glory.

225
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:09,238
Die to be a hero,
but don't die to be a celebrity.

226
00:27:03,209 --> 00:27:06,201
Champ?

227
00:27:15,609 --> 00:27:20,524
- Someone ought to stay with him.
- I will.

228
00:27:20,689 --> 00:27:23,601
Are you okay?

229
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:27,239
I'd like to go home.

230
00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:08,401
Are you okay?
You were hyperventilating.

231
00:28:10,849 --> 00:28:13,761
Your blood pressure will rise -

232
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:19,686
- as your
cardiovascular vessels constrict.

233
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:25,727
- God, you're beautiful.
- Get some rest.

234
00:28:28,969 --> 00:28:33,008
I bet 24 hours ago you didn't think
you'd be spending the night here.

235
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:39,608
You were lucky last night, Nelson.
Don't push it.

236
00:28:43,449 --> 00:28:45,679
ENGAGEM ENT PARTY

237
00:28:49,369 --> 00:28:54,204
<i>I want to wish you two</i>
<i>the best of everything together.</i>

238
00:29:03,689 --> 00:29:06,601
Hello,
may I please speak to Anne Coldren?

239
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:12,928
Anne?

240
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:16,559
<i>Hi, I've been thinking about you.</i>
<i>How are you?</i>

241
00:29:16,729 --> 00:29:19,448
Counting the days
to Thanksgiving break.

242
00:29:19,609 --> 00:29:24,888
I've got to transfer to a school
closer to you or get a faster car.

243
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:29,839
- We should've married last summer.
- <i>My mother wasn't ready yet.</i>

244
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:33,479
You know, you're the best.

245
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:36,726
If anything happens...

246
00:29:36,889 --> 00:29:41,644
- Joe, what's wrong?
- <i>I don't know. I'm just tired.</i>

247
00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:45,848
I'm not making any sense.
I should go.

248
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:50,878
- Joe, you're scaring me.
- It's okay, nothing's wrong.

249
00:29:51,049 --> 00:29:54,166
I love you. Bye.

250
00:31:16,569 --> 00:31:20,847
- Nothing.
- Starting CPR.

251
00:31:23,729 --> 00:31:28,644
- CPR and adrenalin, and nothing!
- What's going on? Come on, Joe!

252
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:34,158
- Come on, Nelson, let me try.
- We're running out of time!

253
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:39,604
- Let me try.
- I'm doing everything I can!

254
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:43,444
- Nelson, step back.
- Come on, Joe!

255
00:32:28,409 --> 00:32:32,004
I got him. Oxygen.

256
00:32:33,969 --> 00:32:37,120
0xygen ready.

257
00:32:39,769 --> 00:32:43,205
CPR successful. Hurley lives.

258
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:46,805
It's okay, Joe.

259
00:32:52,689 --> 00:32:56,238
- It was great.
- Here it comes.

260
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:58,479
Define "great".

261
00:32:58,649 --> 00:33:03,882
I don't know, it's not thinking
about the past or the future.

262
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:09,681
- It's difficult to explain.
- Yeah, dying is funny that way.

263
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:13,762
Nelson's right, there
definitely is activity beyond death.

264
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:18,002
- Absolutely.
- The experience was strange.

265
00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:22,799
- It was almost erotic.
- He's dead and he gets laid.

266
00:33:22,969 --> 00:33:26,120
What do you mean, erotic?

267
00:33:26,289 --> 00:33:30,202
I don't want you to think
it was wantonly sexual.

268
00:33:30,369 --> 00:33:33,441
No, that never
would have occurred to me.

269
00:33:33,609 --> 00:33:39,127
It was friendly. It was something
vaguely feminine guiding me.

270
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:43,919
This could be the conquest of our
generation. The last great frontier.

271
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:49,083
First you had the sea, then
America, the West, the Moon...

272
00:33:49,249 --> 00:33:51,558
...Mr. Leary, drugs,
the inner journey...

273
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:55,039
Our former First Lady
and the outer journey...

274
00:33:55,209 --> 00:33:58,121
- But this is ours!
- We did have disco.

275
00:33:58,289 --> 00:34:03,841
- Fuck the baby boomers.
- Watch your mouth.

276
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:09,686
- <i>I</i> found something. Remember?
- I came back from the dead tonight.

277
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:13,159
It doesn't surprise me.
We had Elvis in here last night.

278
00:34:16,249 --> 00:34:20,003
Pay when you're ready, okay?

279
00:34:21,249 --> 00:34:26,767
- Was it difficult getting back?
- Not that I remember.

280
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:32,720
But you remember everything else?
I think you guys are full of shit.

281
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:38,646
- I'm not buying any of this.
- I wouldn't buy it either...

282
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:42,438
...unless I'd been there.
So what about it, Dave?

283
00:34:42,609 --> 00:34:48,400
- An atheist has nothing to lose.
- I'm going next.

284
00:34:48,569 --> 00:34:54,439
Nobody's going next. You're looking
for answers where there are none.

285
00:34:54,609 --> 00:35:01,003
You just saw what you wanted to see.
Give it up. It's too dangerous.

286
00:35:01,169 --> 00:35:06,687
We can't turn back now.
I'm going further. 1:50.

287
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:12,280
Two minutes...
I changed my mind. Two minutes.

288
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:15,282
- 2: 10.
- 2:20.

289
00:35:17,729 --> 00:35:20,197
It looks like we found a winner.

290
00:35:26,609 --> 00:35:29,681
Enjoying yourself, Nelson?

291
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:42,327
Joe...

292
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:47,965
Was there anything negative
about your experience?

293
00:35:48,129 --> 00:35:51,519
No. Nothing.

294
00:35:55,009 --> 00:35:57,204
Good.

295
00:35:57,369 --> 00:36:04,161
- Hold on.
- Was that your idea of chivalry?

296
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:09,244
- Were you trying to show me up?
- Not everything is about you.

297
00:36:09,409 --> 00:36:14,244
Nobody seems to want me to go under.
I don't need your protection.

298
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:17,401
What do you need, Mannus?

299
00:36:17,569 --> 00:36:21,323
What do you think I need?

300
00:36:21,489 --> 00:36:28,201
When someone is as smart and driven
as you are, and very beautiful, -

301
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:31,839
- it makes the rest of us
very nervous.

302
00:36:33,169 --> 00:36:37,606
- Why did you change your mind?
- I'm the sceptic on this.

303
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:45,642
If I see there's nothing out there,
there's no reason for us to go on.

304
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:49,518
How do you explain
the similarity in death experiences?

305
00:36:49,689 --> 00:36:54,285
People from different cultures see
the same things in the same order.

306
00:36:54,449 --> 00:37:00,684
Maybe there's a hormone released
by the brain at the time of death.

307
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:06,481
No, you're reaching. What if you go
and there is something out there?

308
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:12,524
- Then you can kill yourself, too.
- I'm not going to kill myself.

309
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:19,003
I'm glad to hear that, Mannus.
I might miss you.

310
00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:25,360
- So why this obsession with death?
- It's just an interest.

311
00:37:25,529 --> 00:37:30,557
A personal interest. Goodnight.

312
00:37:30,729 --> 00:37:35,325
- Can I drive you home?
- No, thanks.

313
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:40,288
I didn't take the money.

314
00:38:40,449 --> 00:38:44,408
I got the toaster, but too many
appliances make you love me.

315
00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:46,480
Right, Nelson?

316
00:38:46,649 --> 00:38:52,884
In the end,
we all know what we've done.

317
00:39:14,889 --> 00:39:17,562
Champ?

318
00:40:00,089 --> 00:40:03,559
Come here, Champ.

319
00:40:04,609 --> 00:40:07,442
Come here, boy.

320
00:40:13,689 --> 00:40:16,886
What are you doing here, kid?
Are you all right?

321
00:40:18,929 --> 00:40:21,124
Are you okay?

322
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:23,280
Are you lost?

323
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:48,642
Halloween morning.
Rotting pumpkins, burning leaves, -

324
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:52,245
- black cats
mating like rats in the alley.

325
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:57,005
It were as if we felt no fear.

326
00:40:57,169 --> 00:41:02,482
As if we were already dead,
and had nothing to lose by dying.

327
00:41:02,649 --> 00:41:08,918
Because we lived life so well,
and loved life so much, -

328
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:11,603
- we imagined ourselves immortal.

329
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:17,366
Overwhelming the powers that be
with our passion for science.

330
00:41:17,529 --> 00:41:20,202
Or maybe we were fucked in the head.

331
00:41:22,169 --> 00:41:26,720
Hey, I'm Joe Hurley.
You're Terry, right?

332
00:41:26,889 --> 00:41:32,282
- You had a near-death experience.
- I don't want to talk about it.

333
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:38,843
Wait a minute.
I had a near-death experience also.

334
00:41:40,129 --> 00:41:46,477
I need someone to talk to.
This thing changed my life.

335
00:41:47,289 --> 00:41:52,238
- At first, they didn't believe me.
- What the hell do they know?

336
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:59,440
If you have to go to class, maybe we
can discuss it one night this week?

337
00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:03,727
All that day I knew
something was going to happen.

338
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:09,441
I've always had premonitions.
Once, my aunt was to fly...

339
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:20,480
<i>Why did you do this to me, Joe?</i>

340
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,602
No!

341
00:43:47,489 --> 00:43:51,164
Trick or treat.

342
00:44:31,609 --> 00:44:37,286
It's Halloween. There's a full moon.
Aren't we pushing it a little bit?

343
00:44:38,969 --> 00:44:44,123
I'm sorry I'm late.
I ran into some very big guys.

344
00:44:44,289 --> 00:44:48,362
- Let me take a look at it.
- I'm fine.

345
00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:54,124
- Where the hell have you been?
- I don't feel well. Look at you.

346
00:44:54,289 --> 00:44:57,759
Just worry about your camera.

347
00:44:57,929 --> 00:45:01,126
Nice outfit.

348
00:45:02,129 --> 00:45:04,643
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

349
00:45:05,449 --> 00:45:09,408
Who are you supposed to be?
Boner Man?

350
00:45:10,089 --> 00:45:15,038
- 2:20, don't forget.
- You just hurry up and get back.

351
00:45:15,209 --> 00:45:18,167
You can buy us breakfast.

352
00:45:18,329 --> 00:45:21,765
Don't let go of the rope.

353
00:45:23,249 --> 00:45:26,286
<i>Hoka hey.</i>

354
00:45:26,449 --> 00:45:29,441
See you soon.

355
00:45:37,449 --> 00:45:41,044
20 cc's sodium pentathol in.

356
00:45:43,489 --> 00:45:47,164
- 86°.
- 200 joules charged.

357
00:45:50,329 --> 00:45:53,048
Clear.

358
00:45:56,889 --> 00:46:00,086
Flatline.

359
00:46:47,129 --> 00:46:52,601
What hangs in the air palpably?
Is it hope, or the fear of death?

360
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:56,728
- Shut up, Steckle.
- No, you shut up!

361
00:46:58,489 --> 00:47:02,038
What if he didn't make it back?

362
00:47:03,169 --> 00:47:06,525
Would you miss him, Rachel?

363
00:47:08,289 --> 00:47:10,644
One minute.

364
00:47:26,769 --> 00:47:30,205
- 90°.
- Give him another five seconds.

365
00:47:30,369 --> 00:47:35,443
- Why not ten? We've got the time.
- Are you serious?

366
00:47:35,609 --> 00:47:39,443
<i>Joey, I trusted you.</i>

367
00:47:40,609 --> 00:47:44,397
- Stations. Joe, move yourself.
- Come on, no kidding around here.

368
00:47:44,569 --> 00:47:47,447
Who's kidding?

369
00:47:48,849 --> 00:47:52,558
- What's going on here?
- 92°.

370
00:47:53,569 --> 00:47:56,402
Joe, get it!

371
00:47:56,569 --> 00:48:02,439
Come on. 2: 15, 2: 16, 2: 17, 2: 18...

372
00:48:02,609 --> 00:48:05,840
2:20. Hand it over.

373
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:09,081
This is my lab. 300 joules.

374
00:48:11,529 --> 00:48:14,566
Charged. Clear.

375
00:48:27,289 --> 00:48:29,962
Breathe!

376
00:48:30,129 --> 00:48:35,362
- 1,000, 2,000... What comes next?
- Knock it off, Nelson!

377
00:48:35,529 --> 00:48:41,684
- 5,000. Breathe.
- 300 joules charged. Clear.

378
00:48:42,569 --> 00:48:45,208
Come on, Dave.

379
00:48:55,649 --> 00:48:59,278
- That's it!
- That's not it. It's a v-fib!

380
00:48:59,449 --> 00:49:03,920
- Try lidocaine.
- Not yet.

381
00:49:04,089 --> 00:49:08,879
- Come on, Dave.
- Raise it to 360. Clear.

382
00:49:09,049 --> 00:49:12,883
- Try lidocaine.
- Three fucking minutes.

383
00:49:13,049 --> 00:49:18,521
Starting CPR. Joe, keep filming.
I'm going to bring him back.

384
00:49:20,169 --> 00:49:23,764
<i>You lied to me, Joe.</i>

385
00:49:33,129 --> 00:49:37,281
- We've got him.
- 1 mg eppy in.

386
00:49:37,449 --> 00:49:44,366
That was close.
That was way too close.

387
00:49:45,209 --> 00:49:48,485
- <i>Hoka hey.</i>
- What did you say?

388
00:49:48,649 --> 00:49:53,928
<i>Hoka hey.</i> It's the war cry
of the Sioux Indians. It means...

389
00:49:54,089 --> 00:49:59,766
"Today is a good day to die."
So was it, Dave?

390
00:49:59,929 --> 00:50:04,400
I don't know if I was dead.
I may have felt something.

391
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:08,926
A dream... or just a bunch of stuff
stored up inside my mind.

392
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,762
You were brain-dead.

393
00:50:11,929 --> 00:50:15,683
Some electrical current
circulating through my body...

394
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:22,402
It would've shown up on the EEG.
You were dead. So what happened?

395
00:50:24,249 --> 00:50:27,844
It's hard to verbalise.

396
00:50:28,009 --> 00:50:31,763
It's like being paranoid
without the fear.

397
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:36,081
Like being watched.
You guys were standing over me.

398
00:50:36,249 --> 00:50:40,720
- Who could be watching?
- They're dead.

399
00:50:40,889 --> 00:50:44,802
The sceptic did feel something.
I'm going again.

400
00:50:44,969 --> 00:50:49,520
- No way! I've been bumped twice.
- Four minutes.

401
00:50:49,689 --> 00:50:53,523
- Labraccio went for 3:50.
- That was a mistake.

402
00:50:53,689 --> 00:50:58,319
- Under four minutes is pointless.
- Nobody is going for four minutes!

403
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:02,198
- 4:25.
- 5 minutes.

404
00:51:02,369 --> 00:51:08,001
- I'm next or I'm out for good.
- It'll be hard without her.

405
00:51:08,169 --> 00:51:11,844
- But without me...
- Or me.

406
00:51:16,849 --> 00:51:19,807
Well, mutiny at last.

407
00:51:22,609 --> 00:51:28,844
I trusted you with a brilliant idea.
It was the chance of a lifetime.

408
00:51:29,009 --> 00:51:34,845
- Give it a rest, Nelson.
- None of you had my foresight!

409
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:41,687
Rachel, you want to go next?
Be my guest, but this was my idea!

410
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:43,840
You're tourists!

411
00:51:47,369 --> 00:51:51,601
I would've gone 3:30 or 3:40.
I still might.

412
00:51:51,769 --> 00:51:57,366
But 4:25 is crazy. We're pushing the
five-minute mark. It's dangerous.

413
00:52:00,809 --> 00:52:03,004
<i>You shit, Joe.</i>

414
00:52:03,169 --> 00:52:06,400
<i>You said you loved me, Joe.</i>

415
00:52:09,769 --> 00:52:12,681
- <i>I love you, Joe.</i>
- Buddy?

416
00:52:12,849 --> 00:52:17,525
Skelator, are you listening to me?

417
00:53:24,929 --> 00:53:27,124
Thanks for staying.

418
00:53:27,289 --> 00:53:33,478
I'm on the early shift.
You seem fine. I'll see you later.

419
00:53:33,649 --> 00:53:36,880
- About tonight...
- Don't try to talk me out of it.

420
00:53:37,049 --> 00:53:39,165
Why are you doing this?

421
00:53:39,329 --> 00:53:44,483
I've lost people
that are close to me.

422
00:53:44,649 --> 00:53:49,723
I want to make sure they've gone
to a good place. Is that so trivial?

423
00:53:49,889 --> 00:53:54,440
To tell you the truth, it's the best
reason I've heard yet for going.

424
00:53:54,609 --> 00:53:58,727
There's something
I didn't tell you about last night.

425
00:53:58,889 --> 00:54:06,523
I had this feeling
that if I had gone any further...

426
00:54:06,689 --> 00:54:12,047
...that there was something out
there protecting me. Something good.

427
00:54:12,929 --> 00:54:18,720
- So you don't need to go under.
- The atheist now believes in God?

428
00:54:18,889 --> 00:54:24,407
I'm trying to tell you
that I don't want you to do it.

429
00:54:26,009 --> 00:54:32,357
Think about all we'll have to talk
about... when you bring me back.

430
00:54:34,129 --> 00:54:35,329
I'm dying. Don't lie to me.

431
00:54:35,329 --> 00:54:38,958
I'm dying. Don't lie to me.

432
00:54:41,809 --> 00:54:44,403
Mrs. Amsler, you've fought well.

433
00:54:44,569 --> 00:54:49,848
- Sometimes we just have to let go.
- That's what the voices say.

434
00:54:50,009 --> 00:54:55,800
- What voices?
- They say, "Have you done enough?"

435
00:54:55,969 --> 00:54:59,086
"Have you told everyone
you love them?"

436
00:54:59,249 --> 00:55:02,525
I have.

437
00:55:02,689 --> 00:55:09,925
They're friendly voices. They're
telling you what you need to know.

438
00:55:10,089 --> 00:55:15,243
- What?
- That you have someplace to go.

439
00:55:16,249 --> 00:55:21,039
- Do you believe that?
- Yes, I do.

440
00:55:26,329 --> 00:55:29,207
Yes, I do.

441
00:56:11,249 --> 00:56:14,639
Hey, fellatio!

442
00:56:16,729 --> 00:56:20,847
Got a match? Well, I do.

443
00:56:21,009 --> 00:56:23,921
Your face and my ass.

444
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:27,877
- Your breath and a buffalo fart.
- Do I know you?

445
00:56:28,049 --> 00:56:32,486
You don't know jack shit!
Butt-wad, needle-dick, cock-bite, -

446
00:56:32,649 --> 00:56:35,163
- jack-off, limp-wrist, -

447
00:56:35,329 --> 00:56:40,642
- banana-breath, shit-bird,
bird-turd, turd-face, -

448
00:56:40,809 --> 00:56:44,927
- kiss-ass, brown-nose,
macho-wimp, limp-dick!

449
00:56:45,089 --> 00:56:50,209
What's the matter? Gonna cry?
Cry-baby Davie.

450
00:56:50,369 --> 00:56:54,806
Shit-faced, rat-turd,
ass-licking, son of a bitch.

451
00:57:11,849 --> 00:57:16,445
- How did it happen?
- I was playing hockey.

452
00:57:16,609 --> 00:57:18,998
- About last night...
- It's okay.

453
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:22,923
- No-show Labraccio.
- That's not like him.

454
00:57:23,089 --> 00:57:28,527
- It's his way of trying to stop me.
- It's not a good idea to continue.

455
00:57:28,689 --> 00:57:32,648
- We don't need David.
- Can you do this?

456
00:57:32,809 --> 00:57:38,645
- Can you trust me?
- No, but let's do it anyway.

457
00:57:38,809 --> 00:57:41,687
Nitrous on.

458
00:57:44,529 --> 00:57:47,441
See you soon.

459
00:58:02,329 --> 00:58:07,608
How long's she been under?
We're bringing her back.

460
00:58:07,769 --> 00:58:12,889
- She hasn't been under long enough.
- Just do it, Joe.

461
00:58:13,049 --> 00:58:15,882
Don't expect any kisses for this.

462
00:58:57,769 --> 00:59:04,845
- Aborting fourth experiment. Why?
- Why don't you ask Dr. Death?

463
00:59:05,009 --> 00:59:09,161
- What's going on?
- We're bringing Rachel back early.

464
00:59:09,329 --> 00:59:15,086
- Drop it. Think about Rachel.
- Joe's right. 91 °. Let's be ready.

465
00:59:49,209 --> 00:59:53,043
Rachel, don't go in there.

466
00:59:53,209 --> 00:59:56,918
<i>I</i> told you not to do that.

467
00:59:57,569 --> 00:59:59,764
Denny!

468
01:00:00,969 --> 01:00:03,437
It's your fault!

469
01:00:09,129 --> 01:00:13,042
- Nothing.
- Take me up to 300.

470
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:16,042
Come on, Rachel.

471
01:00:36,929 --> 01:00:39,921
300 joules. Clear!

472
01:00:40,089 --> 01:00:42,808
- Got her! .
- V-fib. We don't have her.

473
01:00:42,969 --> 01:00:46,439
- It's okay, we'll get her.
- Step me up to 360.

474
01:00:48,369 --> 01:00:53,489
- What did you do to me?
- A short, maybe a circuit.

475
01:00:54,009 --> 01:00:57,684
- Joe, you charged the battery?
- Shit!

476
01:00:57,849 --> 01:01:01,808
Starting CPR. Bag her, Steckle.

477
01:01:05,209 --> 01:01:07,677
No pulse.

478
01:01:31,969 --> 01:01:38,158
- It's not working. Joe, take over.
- She's been under 4 minutes.

479
01:01:40,249 --> 01:01:45,084
We're moving to bretylium.
It's the only way.

480
01:01:45,249 --> 01:01:48,446
Don't do it, you'll fry her.

481
01:01:51,689 --> 01:01:54,078
Nelson!

482
01:01:54,809 --> 01:01:58,165
Please, don't!

483
01:02:03,409 --> 01:02:06,958
You'll bring her back?

484
01:02:10,129 --> 01:02:12,962
Come on, Mannus.

485
01:02:15,449 --> 01:02:17,440
Lidocaine in.

486
01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:21,363
Come on back to us. Come on.

487
01:02:23,529 --> 01:02:27,442
Wait!

488
01:02:29,009 --> 01:02:32,319
I heard something.

489
01:02:33,769 --> 01:02:37,125
Oxygen!

490
01:02:40,209 --> 01:02:43,599
She's back.

491
01:02:53,809 --> 01:02:58,803
- Why did you stop us?
- Something happened to me today.

492
01:02:58,969 --> 01:03:02,928
There was a girl... Winnie Hicks.
I went to school with her.

493
01:03:03,089 --> 01:03:05,922
We used to make fun of her.

494
01:03:06,089 --> 01:03:12,085
On the train, she started calling
me names. Right in front of me!

495
01:03:12,249 --> 01:03:17,482
- She was still only ten years old.
- Maybe you fell asleep.

496
01:03:17,649 --> 01:03:22,643
- No, it was not a dream.
- I've seen some odd things, too.

497
01:03:22,809 --> 01:03:26,643
- I thought it was brain damage.
- In your case it probably is.

498
01:03:26,809 --> 01:03:29,767
Shut that off, Steckle,
this is personal.

499
01:03:29,929 --> 01:03:34,400
I've been haunted by images of women
that I secretly videotaped.

500
01:03:34,569 --> 01:03:39,723
They're all members
of the Joe Hurley Video Library.

501
01:03:39,889 --> 01:03:43,848
What about you, Nelson?
Who's come looking for you?

502
01:03:45,049 --> 01:03:49,520
His name's Billy Mahoney.
He's a kid we picked on in school.

503
01:03:49,689 --> 01:03:54,240
- It's no big deal.
- Then what happened to your face?

504
01:03:54,409 --> 01:03:58,800
- The little guy gets carried away.
- Wait a minute.

505
01:03:58,969 --> 01:04:04,168
I can understand Dave nodding off,
and pervert here having flashbacks.

506
01:04:04,329 --> 01:04:10,882
You're saying this guy physically
touches you. That is not possible!

507
01:04:11,049 --> 01:04:14,724
- This is too weird.
- Weird? We've experienced death.

508
01:04:14,889 --> 01:04:18,598
Now somehow we've brought
our sins back physically.

509
01:04:18,769 --> 01:04:23,524
- When did you know about this?
- After Joe went.

510
01:04:23,689 --> 01:04:29,685
- But you didn't say a word!
- Jesus Christ! We're scientists.

511
01:04:29,849 --> 01:04:35,048
It's reckless, immoral and unethical
for you to withhold your findings.

512
01:04:35,209 --> 01:04:38,997
Rachel Mannus may have the answers
to life and death.

513
01:04:39,169 --> 01:04:42,639
She was under for five minutes!

514
01:04:42,809 --> 01:04:47,519
If she walks out of that
ladies' room with those answers, -

515
01:04:47,689 --> 01:04:50,761
- the whole world will worship her.

516
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:56,845
- Just like you do.
- You should've told us, Nelson.

517
01:04:57,009 --> 01:05:01,685
- You wouldn't have done it.
- At least we'd have had a choice!

518
01:05:08,569 --> 01:05:11,606
We're fucked.

519
01:05:12,609 --> 01:05:17,842
- Rachel, are you all right?
- I'm okay.

520
01:05:26,609 --> 01:05:33,208
I said I was fine.
Are you guys gonna watch me?

521
01:06:42,849 --> 01:06:47,445
Come on, Billy Mahoney.

522
01:06:47,609 --> 01:06:50,487
Give it your best shot.

523
01:06:51,529 --> 01:06:56,842
I dare you... I fucking dare you.

524
01:06:57,649 --> 01:07:04,487
- Things from our past want revenge?
- I'm not exactly sure how it works.

525
01:07:04,649 --> 01:07:11,248
But if you see anything,
I want you to talk to me about it.

526
01:07:11,409 --> 01:07:15,084
You can tell the doctor.

527
01:07:15,249 --> 01:07:21,597
- I'll be in the living room.
- Is it people we've hurt?

528
01:07:21,769 --> 01:07:25,284
Did something happen tonight?

529
01:07:26,289 --> 01:07:28,325
No.

530
01:07:29,569 --> 01:07:33,198
Just try and get some rest.

531
01:07:37,689 --> 01:07:42,126
- How's she doing?
- I think she's hiding something.

532
01:07:42,289 --> 01:07:45,520
- What did Nelson do to that kid?
- I don't know!

533
01:07:45,689 --> 01:07:50,638
- We must keep each other informed.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

534
01:07:50,809 --> 01:07:55,929
Why don't you guys take off?
I'll stay with her. I'm sorry.

535
01:08:32,409 --> 01:08:35,924
We're gonna get you, Billy Mahoney!

536
01:08:37,209 --> 01:08:40,246
No!

537
01:08:41,489 --> 01:08:44,003
Stop, Nelson!

538
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:17,239
- How are you doing?
- I'm late. I'll see you later.

539
01:09:17,409 --> 01:09:23,405
- Wait. Where are you going?
- I've got to stop her.

540
01:09:23,569 --> 01:09:26,163
Good morning, Rachel.

541
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:30,319
No... no...

542
01:09:31,489 --> 01:09:36,927
Her voices were wrong.
There's nothing beautiful out there.

543
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:41,879
- Losing them is part of our work.
- But I was wrong.

544
01:10:45,129 --> 01:10:48,565
You look like
you're enjoying the day.

545
01:10:50,489 --> 01:10:55,768
- Don't you remember me, Joe?
- Yes, of course.

546
01:10:55,929 --> 01:11:01,845
- Are you a model? You could be.
- Look, I've got to go.

547
01:11:02,009 --> 01:11:06,287
I'm not picking you up.
I just picked you out.

548
01:11:06,449 --> 01:11:09,521
Mind if I buy you a drink?

549
01:11:09,689 --> 01:11:14,160
- I'll call you this weekend.
- Fine, I'm in the book.

550
01:11:18,689 --> 01:11:22,238
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Who are you?

551
01:11:22,409 --> 01:11:27,358
- What are you doing?
- Some crazy girl... Do I know you?

552
01:11:27,529 --> 01:11:31,966
Would you like to?
We don't have to do anything.

553
01:11:32,129 --> 01:11:36,327
We can just lie together.
Hold each other in our underwear.

554
01:11:42,569 --> 01:11:45,527
I'll call you. I promise.

555
01:11:45,689 --> 01:11:49,568
I'm tired of playing the field.

556
01:11:49,729 --> 01:11:53,005
We can stop whenever you want.

557
01:11:54,489 --> 01:11:57,686
It'll only
make our relationship better.

558
01:11:59,449 --> 01:12:02,521
I've never felt like this before.

559
01:12:05,409 --> 01:12:09,038
Of course I respect you.

560
01:12:15,449 --> 01:12:20,477
- Call me whenever you want.
- Show me that you love me.

561
01:12:20,649 --> 01:12:23,925
You're not real!

562
01:12:28,329 --> 01:12:31,446
Anne, is that you?

563
01:12:34,329 --> 01:12:39,357
- Is it really you?
- You sounded so upset on the phone.

564
01:12:39,529 --> 01:12:44,603
- I was worried. I took the bus.
- What a great surprise.

565
01:12:45,369 --> 01:12:50,397
- How long have you been here?
- Long enough to see your tapes.

566
01:12:51,809 --> 01:12:54,926
My God!

567
01:12:55,089 --> 01:13:01,039
You're gonna think I'm leaving you
because you slept with those girls.

568
01:13:01,209 --> 01:13:03,928
They meant nothing to me.

569
01:13:04,089 --> 01:13:09,322
I wish they had meant something.
If you had cared for any of them, -

570
01:13:09,489 --> 01:13:12,162
- I could have fought that.

571
01:13:12,329 --> 01:13:16,481
But to film all those girls...
To have so little respect...

572
01:13:16,649 --> 01:13:22,758
Those women trusted you.
You have no understanding of trust.

573
01:13:24,569 --> 01:13:29,085
- It's not what you think.
- Yes, it is.

574
01:13:30,689 --> 01:13:30,729
Hello, is this Mrs. Earl R. Hicks?

575
01:13:30,729 --> 01:13:33,562
Hello, is this Mrs. Earl R. Hicks?

576
01:13:33,729 --> 01:13:38,405
Do you have a daughter Winnie,
about 26 years old?

577
01:13:38,569 --> 01:13:44,087
You do? I'm David Labraccio.
I was in school with Winnie.

578
01:13:44,249 --> 01:13:47,446
Yeah, my parents still live there.

579
01:13:47,609 --> 01:13:51,682
I wanted to get in touch with her
and I was wondering...

580
01:13:55,529 --> 01:13:59,044
Okay. Do you have her address?

581
01:14:00,129 --> 01:14:03,485
Great. I really appreciate it. Bye.

582
01:14:11,449 --> 01:14:15,567
- Jesus!
- It looks as bad as it feels?

583
01:14:15,729 --> 01:14:20,564
- You want me to take a look at it?
- No. How's Rachel doing?

584
01:14:20,729 --> 01:14:25,405
She didn't come out of that bathroom
with the answers to life and death.

585
01:14:25,569 --> 01:14:30,165
Where are you going?
Can I go?

586
01:14:30,329 --> 01:14:37,326
- It's a two hour drive.
- I don't want to be alone.

587
01:14:38,209 --> 01:14:44,762
You will remove the left kidney
and dissect the lower intestines.

588
01:14:44,929 --> 01:14:50,845
Remove the ascending colon
from the transverse colon.

589
01:14:51,009 --> 01:14:56,367
Proceed to the sigmoid colon
and on to the appendix.

590
01:14:58,769 --> 01:15:03,206
- Where the hell are you going?
- Are you okay?

591
01:15:03,369 --> 01:15:09,365
I would be fine if everyone would
stop asking me if I'm all right.

592
01:15:12,409 --> 01:15:16,527
- Is she getting the heebie-jeebies?
- I'm spooking, too.

593
01:15:16,689 --> 01:15:20,728
Getting us kicked out of med-school
won't get Anne back.

594
01:16:10,409 --> 01:16:12,127
Mannus!

595
01:16:12,289 --> 01:16:18,159
I'll handle this. Back to work
or suffer the consequences.

596
01:16:18,329 --> 01:16:20,445
Fuck it.

597
01:16:28,729 --> 01:16:32,563
- This must be it.
- Winnie did well for herself.

598
01:16:32,729 --> 01:16:37,849
- She won't even remember you.
- It's worth a shot.

599
01:16:38,009 --> 01:16:41,206
- Are you coming?
- No.

600
01:16:41,369 --> 01:16:47,558
Listen, if anything happens...
If you need me, just honk the horn.

601
01:17:14,009 --> 01:17:19,367
Ring, ring, ring.
Dave, you should've sent a letter.

602
01:17:19,529 --> 01:17:22,680
Anybody home?

603
01:17:27,769 --> 01:17:33,127
- Hi, is your mother at home?
- Coming.

604
01:17:35,369 --> 01:17:38,167
Go in the house, baby.

605
01:17:38,809 --> 01:17:44,884
- Yes? Can I help you?
- Yeah, I think you can.

606
01:17:45,049 --> 01:17:49,759
Are you Winnie Hicks?
From Claremont?

607
01:17:49,929 --> 01:17:55,765
I'm David Labraccio.
We went to school together.

608
01:17:55,929 --> 01:17:59,524
I was a little smaller then.

609
01:18:00,929 --> 01:18:04,319
I just drove up from the city.
That's my truck.

610
01:18:06,729 --> 01:18:10,005
Hello, I'm nice. He's nice.

611
01:18:10,169 --> 01:18:14,401
We're both fucking lunatics.
Can I come in, please?

612
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:22,524
I've got to hand it to you, Dave...
you've got guts.

613
01:19:00,729 --> 01:19:05,564
This is beautiful.
You've done well for yourself.

614
01:19:05,729 --> 01:19:09,324
Well, it isn't medical school.

615
01:19:09,489 --> 01:19:13,243
But I never liked school anyway.

616
01:19:13,409 --> 01:19:16,845
I wasn't very good at it.

617
01:19:17,009 --> 01:19:21,366
- I'm surprised you remember me.
- I do remember you.

618
01:19:21,529 --> 01:19:25,317
I also remember the way
we treated you back then.

619
01:19:25,489 --> 01:19:31,883
You were a little shy, and I was
a real jerk... and I'm sorry.

620
01:19:32,049 --> 01:19:38,966
What are you talking about? That was
so long ago I don't even remember.

621
01:19:39,129 --> 01:19:42,087
Let's not dredge up all that stuff.

622
01:19:42,249 --> 01:19:49,121
However we made you feel...
it was wrong. We were wrong.

623
01:19:51,409 --> 01:19:54,003
Go on.

624
01:19:58,529 --> 01:20:02,283
I have a family now.

625
01:20:02,449 --> 01:20:05,839
I haven't been that ugly little girl
in quite some time.

626
01:20:06,009 --> 01:20:10,002
You were never ugly.

627
01:20:11,169 --> 01:20:14,445
Why did you come here?

628
01:20:49,209 --> 01:20:51,769
David, help!

629
01:20:51,929 --> 01:20:57,401
I know how kids are.
It didn't mean anything.

630
01:20:57,569 --> 01:21:04,520
- I didn't mean to come here...
- Winnie, are you all right?

631
01:21:04,689 --> 01:21:06,884
I'm fine, Ben.

632
01:21:15,049 --> 01:21:20,885
I'm sorry if I made you feel bad.
I didn't want to hurt you again.

633
01:21:23,289 --> 01:21:25,439
I'm gonna go.

634
01:21:28,489 --> 01:21:31,162
David?

635
01:21:33,209 --> 01:21:35,120
Thank you.

636
01:21:36,089 --> 01:21:39,479
Are you sure?

637
01:21:41,129 --> 01:21:43,802
Thanks.

638
01:21:53,169 --> 01:21:58,687
David, help!

639
01:22:50,969 --> 01:22:55,201
Nelson, stop. Stop!

640
01:22:58,049 --> 01:23:04,727
- Where's Billy Mahoney?
- No one's here but the two of us.

641
01:23:04,889 --> 01:23:07,198
Let go!

642
01:23:35,529 --> 01:23:38,168
Where the hell have you guys been?

643
01:23:41,329 --> 01:23:45,117
- She freaked in class.
- How are you doing?

644
01:23:45,289 --> 01:23:52,604
Fine, for somebody who keeps seeing
her father who's been dead 20 years.

645
01:23:53,609 --> 01:23:57,841
"Death is beautiful."
What a bunch of crap.

646
01:24:01,529 --> 01:24:04,566
How are you doing, Nelson? Okay?

647
01:24:06,769 --> 01:24:09,841
I'd like to thank you
for the nightmare.

648
01:24:10,009 --> 01:24:16,084
You were so eager to jump on...
Welcome aboard.

649
01:24:16,249 --> 01:24:18,479
You withheld information.

650
01:24:19,889 --> 01:24:23,768
- I'm sorry you're so upset.
- You're not the only one at risk!

651
01:24:23,929 --> 01:24:30,482
- I always felt this was unnatural.
- Steckle, you didn't risk a thing.

652
01:24:30,649 --> 01:24:35,165
- Stop! We're all in this together.
- No, we're not.

653
01:24:35,329 --> 01:24:38,878
Isn't she strong? So independent.

654
01:24:39,049 --> 01:24:42,325
When I get into trouble,
I don't drag everybody down with me.

655
01:24:42,489 --> 01:24:47,768
Come on! What happened to you?
Caught with your videotapes down.

656
01:24:47,929 --> 01:24:53,879
You swore at a little girl. You're
having bad dreams about your daddy.

657
01:24:54,049 --> 01:24:59,123
- I'm really sorry!
- You don't know anything about me.

658
01:24:59,289 --> 01:25:03,168
But Dave does, doesn't he?

659
01:25:03,329 --> 01:25:08,722
Come on, they're your sins.
Live with them... I do.

660
01:25:08,889 --> 01:25:13,041
You want to see death?
Take a good look. It <i>is</i> beautiful.

661
01:25:13,209 --> 01:25:18,329
You've already hurt yourself.
Do you want to hurt her, too?

662
01:25:21,809 --> 01:25:27,884
Help him find Billy Mahoney.
Just do it, all right?

663
01:25:28,049 --> 01:25:33,681
- Don't leave him alone.
- Why do we want to find Billy?

664
01:25:33,849 --> 01:25:40,322
Young Dr. Dave thinks
he's solved our karmic problems.

665
01:25:41,849 --> 01:25:46,127
- Atonement, gentlemen.
- Atonement?

666
01:25:46,289 --> 01:25:51,522
Wait a goddamn minute!
You're always running away from me.

667
01:25:51,689 --> 01:25:55,045
Why don't you talk to me?

668
01:25:58,649 --> 01:26:03,803
- My father shot himself.
- And you feel responsible?

669
01:26:04,889 --> 01:26:09,917
There was this door in our hallway
and I wasn't supposed to go in...

670
01:26:10,089 --> 01:26:15,083
Kids always feel responsible.
You could not have been to blame.

671
01:26:15,249 --> 01:26:20,881
You said it yourself.
People we've wronged want revenge.

672
01:26:21,049 --> 01:26:25,327
I don't know if this will help,
but going to see Winnie Hicks...

673
01:26:25,489 --> 01:26:34,761
I can't explain, but it lifted...
just asking for forgiveness...

674
01:26:34,929 --> 01:26:38,638
Winnie Hicks is alive.
My father's dead.

675
01:26:38,809 --> 01:26:43,166
Your father is in a good place.

676
01:26:43,329 --> 01:26:46,958
He wants you to let him go.

677
01:26:48,089 --> 01:26:51,126
Then why is he back?

678
01:27:05,049 --> 01:27:06,767
Here.

679
01:27:06,929 --> 01:27:11,047
- Where the hell are we?
- We'd better get you to a hospital.

680
01:27:17,569 --> 01:27:23,007
Come on, this is a short cut.
I can't believe I remember all this.

681
01:27:25,889 --> 01:27:31,759
- The neighbourhood's falling apart.
- Give me the keys!

682
01:27:31,929 --> 01:27:35,285
<i>Step on a crack</i>
<i>break your mother's back...</i>

683
01:27:39,569 --> 01:27:45,201
Last one over is a rotten egg!

684
01:27:46,369 --> 01:27:50,282
Come on, boys,
salvation just ahead.

685
01:28:04,889 --> 01:28:09,167
This is a graveyard.

686
01:28:09,329 --> 01:28:15,438
Nelson, where the fuck are you?
This isn't funny any more.

687
01:28:15,609 --> 01:28:18,123
It never was.

688
01:28:18,289 --> 01:28:20,883
- Where the hell are you?
- Right here.

689
01:28:26,049 --> 01:28:30,964
This is where Billy lives. Wake up,
you little shit, you've got company!

690
01:28:31,929 --> 01:28:37,686
I knew he was here...
because I put him here.

691
01:28:37,849 --> 01:28:42,877
- Billy Mahoney!
- No, Nelson, don't do it!

692
01:29:20,849 --> 01:29:25,001
I was taken away from my family
when I was nine years old.

693
01:29:25,169 --> 01:29:31,119
I went to Stoneham School for Boys.
I thought I'd paid my dues!

694
01:29:31,289 --> 01:29:36,682
It was an accident.
Let's go home, okay?

695
01:29:36,849 --> 01:29:43,038
Dave's right...
I can still make amends.

696
01:29:43,209 --> 01:29:46,519
How?

697
01:29:55,929 --> 01:30:01,799
- Nelson?
- Joe, I've got to borrow your car.

698
01:30:04,289 --> 01:30:07,884
Nelson, wait.

699
01:30:13,449 --> 01:30:15,599
My God!

700
01:30:48,769 --> 01:30:54,082
Hello.
What? Where?

701
01:31:07,449 --> 01:31:11,408
Nelson freaked out.
Joe and Steckle are stranded.

702
01:31:11,569 --> 01:31:14,481
- Will you be all right alone?
- Yeah.

703
01:33:51,129 --> 01:33:54,087
Daddy.

704
01:33:57,089 --> 01:34:00,286
Rachel.

705
01:34:01,129 --> 01:34:04,201
Sweetheart...

706
01:34:06,569 --> 01:34:09,845
I'm sorry.

707
01:34:13,969 --> 01:34:18,008
Forgive me.

708
01:34:51,449 --> 01:34:57,046
Billy Mahoney died 17 years ago,
and Nelson feels responsible.

709
01:34:57,209 --> 01:35:02,602
- Do you know where he went?
- He ran off to make amends.

710
01:35:02,769 --> 01:35:06,603
- You think he'd try to flatline?
- Alone? That would be suicide.

711
01:35:19,449 --> 01:35:23,567
- David?
- No, it's Nelson.

712
01:35:23,729 --> 01:35:26,562
<i>David's out trying to find you.</i>

713
01:35:26,729 --> 01:35:33,077
I wanted to say I was sorry.
Please, tell David.

714
01:35:33,249 --> 01:35:39,643
- <i>I'm sorry I got you into this.</i>
- No, none of that matters now.

715
01:35:43,929 --> 01:35:48,878
Rachel, everything matters.
Everything we do matters.

716
01:35:50,049 --> 01:35:53,644
- That's why I'm going under again.
- No, Nelson, wait.

717
01:35:53,809 --> 01:35:59,042
- <i>Tell me where you are.</i>
- I really am sorry.

718
01:36:24,889 --> 01:36:28,086
- It's payback for our arrogance.
- Save it.

719
01:37:00,769 --> 01:37:07,117
It's a good thing I didn't flatline.
I used to tease my fat babysitter.

720
01:37:14,969 --> 01:37:18,598
Okay, Billy Mahoney, come on.

721
01:38:56,409 --> 01:39:01,244
- Body temperature down to 78°.
- He used potassium!

722
01:39:04,889 --> 01:39:09,485
Joe, electrodes!
300. Clear.

723
01:39:12,649 --> 01:39:16,881
- Nothing.
- We have to go again. Clear.

724
01:39:26,969 --> 01:39:30,200
Go up to 360. Clear!

725
01:39:30,369 --> 01:39:36,239
- I can't hear anything.
- He called. It's been nine minutes.

726
01:39:36,409 --> 01:39:38,559
Let's intubate.

727
01:39:42,569 --> 01:39:46,528
I can't get it in.
His trachea's too tight.

728
01:39:51,609 --> 01:39:54,806
Stop, Billy!

729
01:40:07,049 --> 01:40:11,804
- Nothing.
- Get me 4mg of atropine ready.

730
01:40:20,089 --> 01:40:23,923
- David...
- Atropine intratracheal.

731
01:40:24,089 --> 01:40:30,927
- This is a truckload, Dave.
- This has got to work. Come on.

732
01:40:36,489 --> 01:40:39,561
- Come on, Nelson.
- He's been dead ten minutes.

733
01:40:39,729 --> 01:40:44,280
- He's not in v-fib.
- Eppy intracardial.

734
01:40:44,449 --> 01:40:47,441
Just do it!

735
01:40:50,169 --> 01:40:53,047
No!

736
01:40:53,209 --> 01:40:56,087
Don't do it, Billy!

737
01:40:56,249 --> 01:40:59,719
I'm sorry!

738
01:41:25,929 --> 01:41:27,129
Starting CPR!

739
01:41:27,129 --> 01:41:28,562
Starting CPR!

740
01:41:29,889 --> 01:41:32,608
It's been 12 minutes! He is dead.

741
01:41:32,769 --> 01:41:35,442
Breathe!

742
01:41:38,569 --> 01:41:41,800
Forget about it. We lost him.

743
01:41:41,969 --> 01:41:44,767
Dave, stop it!

744
01:41:44,929 --> 01:41:48,638
Stop, David.

745
01:41:48,809 --> 01:41:52,597
David, stop it!

746
01:41:52,769 --> 01:41:55,920
Let him go.

747
01:42:09,849 --> 01:42:14,604
- We're all responsible for this.
- Maybe we deserve this.

748
01:42:14,769 --> 01:42:18,967
No.
It's not fair and it's not right.

749
01:42:19,129 --> 01:42:24,647
I'm sorry, God! I'm sorry we stepped
on your fucking territory!

750
01:42:24,809 --> 01:42:29,007
I'm sorry! Isn't that enough?

751
01:42:32,729 --> 01:42:38,042
- Apparently not.
- I'll call the police.

752
01:42:40,569 --> 01:42:46,883
I could hear it in his voice on the
phone. He felt he deserved to die.

753
01:42:47,089 --> 01:42:53,005
Bullshit! It was a mistake.
He was just a little kid.

754
01:42:53,609 --> 01:42:56,885
He doesn't deserve to die!

755
01:44:01,009 --> 01:44:04,399
Come on, Nelson!

756
01:44:09,329 --> 01:44:13,368
- Clear...
- No, wait!

757
01:44:16,569 --> 01:44:19,641
I've got a pulse.
We've fucking got him!

758
01:44:19,809 --> 01:44:24,724
- Come on, pick up the beat.
- Easy, don't rush him.

759
01:44:24,889 --> 01:44:30,486
- Pick up the beat.
- Don't rush him.

760
01:44:37,009 --> 01:44:39,887
That's it.

761
01:44:50,009 --> 01:44:54,685
Hail Mary, praise Jesus,
and all that stuff.

762
01:44:54,849 --> 01:45:00,765
- Hi, don't try to talk.
- I've got to get this on tape.

763
01:45:17,169 --> 01:45:19,444
He said...

764
01:45:21,689 --> 01:45:25,318
He said it wasn't
such a good day to die.

765
01:45:37,649 --> 01:45:39,609
Thank you.

766
01:45:39,609 --> 01:45:41,201
Thank you.
