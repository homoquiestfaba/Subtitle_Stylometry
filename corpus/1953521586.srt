1
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,983
Bring your boat is fine.

2
00:02:13,242 --> 00:02:17,156
I like it anyway.
Father, do you think it fine?

3
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:20,040
- I love it, Laura.
- Come on. Dad likes it.

4
00:02:20,582 --> 00:02:23,205
- Who wants breakfast?
- I!

5
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:25,459
I want pancakes.

6
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,840
Dressed up situation.
I thought you already started to come back to haunt.

7
00:03:14,553 --> 00:03:18,765
- Please.
- Certified and all.

8
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:24,099
Navigator two of the best days.

9
00:03:25,314 --> 00:03:31,851
Name has not been changed. This is
door and the motor.

10
00:03:32,071 --> 00:03:34,229
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

11
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,448
Are you divorced?

12
00:03:41,413 --> 00:03:45,541
- I do not.
- A divorced will be here...

13
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:52,044
Between the foot of chicken legs and lives in a boat
YOU a couple of months and go away.

14
00:03:53,718 --> 00:03:58,012
For all get used to it. Here is the time
peaceful.

15
00:03:58,222 --> 00:04:02,551
- Do you want to know something else?
- I'll take things clear.

16
00:04:02,768 --> 00:04:05,639
Okay. See you later.

17
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,317
I have a boat, boating
if I were a man, but when I'm not.

18
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:19,069
- Have you?
- We'll see.

19
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,322
Do not forget. In that order.

20
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,958
I could not help looking.

21
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:28,338
You will need such a... not good.

22
00:11:29,507 --> 00:11:33,836
You might have a little to do.
I'll be Windissä West.

23
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:37,885
Do you live in it? - Yes. Since June
since I left.

24
00:11:38,057 --> 00:11:44,059
I've always wanted to do this.
The summer was great.

25
00:11:47,192 --> 00:11:51,023
As late has been great.
I'll be right.

26
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:56,525
- Have you divorced?
- I do not.

27
00:11:57,576 --> 00:12:03,163
Good, if you put the boat in order.
Women like sailing.

28
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:10,373
In fact, I  harder sailing. There is no
patience. Too much work.

29
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:13,793
But it all works, right?

30
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:20,180
Duty calls. See you later.

31
00:12:20,558 --> 00:12:23,345
- Thanks for the beer.
- Please.

32
00:15:02,095 --> 00:15:06,638
- Good evening.
- How are you?

33
00:15:25,493 --> 00:15:28,411
Thank you, Lauren. "

34
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,242
Lauren...

35
00:15:38,464 --> 00:15:42,046
<i> Lauren, do not run to the bathroom
... </ i>

36
00:16:05,742 --> 00:16:07,781
Oh, God...

37
00:16:18,462 --> 00:16:21,333
Can not...

38
00:16:36,147 --> 00:16:38,602
He bought Hesperus.

39
00:17:10,557 --> 00:17:12,715
Damn.

40
00:17:16,437 --> 00:17:18,513
Hello?

41
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:22,413
You seemed a little tense in the morning.

42
00:18:23,838 --> 00:18:29,128
- What is it?
- yesterday I made a deal.

43
00:18:29,343 --> 00:18:32,344
One place Charlevoix.

44
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:39,183
Too Cold too... rain.

45
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:46,517
All too quiet.

46
00:18:48,738 --> 00:18:51,063
Forced to leave.

47
00:18:53,492 --> 00:18:56,908
- I'll see you.
- Good luck.

48
00:19:01,543 --> 00:19:04,034
When are you going to go?

49
00:19:08,424 --> 00:19:10,417
See you later.

50
00:23:20,927 --> 00:23:26,087
Good... Take it easy, son.

51
00:23:26,307 --> 00:23:29,641
Calm down.

52
00:23:31,104 --> 00:23:36,892
All is going well.
Take it easy. Spit it out.

53
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,359
You're doing just fine.

54
00:25:24,592 --> 00:25:27,546
- More coffee?
- Thank you.

55
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:38,018
You do not like homemade food.

56
00:25:43,736 --> 00:25:46,309
Did you hear last night bagpipes
call?

57
00:25:47,323 --> 00:25:51,238
I did not hear anything.

58
00:25:56,249 --> 00:25:59,665
- Is this acceptable?
- No, of course not.

59
00:26:33,912 --> 00:26:38,787
I'm trying to quit, but I want to
ever enjoy.

60
00:26:40,043 --> 00:26:43,459
Is there a garden break,
and a cigarette break?

61
00:26:44,756 --> 00:26:46,962
Right.

62
00:26:48,593 --> 00:26:53,420
- Does the engine still does not work?
- It started almost last week.

63
00:26:54,598 --> 00:26:57,007
Are you going to take it as soon as the open sea?

64
00:27:02,273 --> 00:27:06,022
Hesperus is not afraid of cold water.

65
00:27:06,694 --> 00:27:11,155
- How long have you been on the boat?
- 51 days.

66
00:27:12,867 --> 00:27:15,192
Who  those days fall?

67
00:29:11,152 --> 00:29:15,648
Not worth
mixed with alcohol and drugs.

68
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:44,501
<i> Lotus eaters called
residents. They were friendly </ i>

69
00:31:44,722 --> 00:31:49,680
<i> and gave sailors fruit.
They did not want anything bad... </ i>

70
00:31:49,894 --> 00:31:54,520
<i>... but thought that it was
the best thing for them... can give. </ i>

71
00:31:54,732 --> 00:31:57,649
The boat is there.

72
00:31:59,112 --> 00:32:03,988
This we have. You see,
Lauren?

73
00:32:10,498 --> 00:32:16,168
<i> When the wind died down, they took
oars and rowed for several days, - </ i>

74
00:32:16,337 --> 00:32:19,788
<i> until they reached the ground,
cyclones in which to live. </ I>

75
00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:23,300

<i> On the island... </ i>

77
00:32:34,939 --> 00:32:37,062
Are you there?

78
00:32:50,455 --> 00:32:52,743
Wait a minute.

79
00:32:55,543 --> 00:33:02,126
<i>  Lootuksensyöjät called

80
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,310
See, I'm being ripped off!
Let the whole shit!

81
00:38:52,275 --> 00:38:54,232
Oh, God...

82
00:38:54,486 --> 00:38:59,860
- I did not know where else to go.
- Sit. You need to warm up.

83
00:39:00,074 --> 00:39:04,535
Put ​​this on.

84
00:39:05,038 --> 00:39:08,537
You get a warm drink.

85
00:39:13,171 --> 00:39:15,662
This.

86
00:39:23,181 --> 00:39:25,802
It should help.

87
00:39:28,686 --> 00:39:32,553
- Do you like tea?
- I have never tasted.

88
00:39:32,857 --> 00:39:35,812
Teetäkö? Really?

89
00:39:43,201 --> 00:39:48,443
Once I called you, I liked
break and I followed you.

90
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:53,662
- Is not that clever?
- It's all right.

91
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,345
Joey does not mean anything by it.

92
00:40:05,348 --> 00:40:11,137
Be here as long as you want.
Sleep here. I sleep at the bow.

93
00:40:20,071 --> 00:40:22,230
Lauren?

94
00:40:28,788 --> 00:40:30,828
Lauren?

95
00:40:46,598 --> 00:40:50,547
I'm going to the bow, so you
a moment in peace.

96
00:43:09,323 --> 00:43:11,862
Do you put the sail?

97
00:43:13,412 --> 00:43:17,279
Harbor is a great sail maker.

98
00:43:17,499 --> 00:43:22,741
- I want to do it yourself.
- It's your business.

99
00:43:22,962 --> 00:43:25,797
The place is closed today, however.

100
00:43:46,986 --> 00:43:50,936
Less on your back, the more
feet.

101
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,205
Good way. In that way, you keep going
to row all day.

102
00:44:00,166 --> 00:44:05,706
I wanted to ask what the two
sailors are the best days.

103
00:44:05,922 --> 00:44:09,125
Day, when he buys a boat and the
day when he sells the boat.

104
00:44:09,342 --> 00:44:17,089
- One of life's truths?
- I do not know. I have experienced only one.

105
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:59,047
Oh, no.

106
00:45:09,527 --> 00:45:12,481
Come on.

107
00:45:30,507 --> 00:45:33,626
Do I need a permit to enter the ship?

108
00:45:34,886 --> 00:45:37,211
You are already on board.

109
00:45:43,395 --> 00:45:48,769
When you put your cell phone
out of the earth? - Halloween season.

110
00:45:50,527 --> 00:45:53,611
I've been coming here after
twice a week talking to you.

111
00:46:06,585 --> 00:46:11,460
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to clean the fuel line.

112
00:46:11,673 --> 00:46:15,089
This is a sailing ship.
Why does the engine have to fix it?

113
00:46:15,301 --> 00:46:19,844
90 per cent of sail boats passing
75 percent of the time engine.

114
00:46:21,224 --> 00:46:23,893
Engine.

115
00:46:26,187 --> 00:46:28,311
When are you coming back?

116
00:46:34,904 --> 00:46:37,111
I do not know.

117
00:46:38,575 --> 00:46:41,196
How much time do you need?

118
00:46:42,203 --> 00:46:44,409
I do not know.

119
00:46:45,665 --> 00:46:49,165
You can work remotely.
We'll leave you alone.

120
00:46:49,378 --> 00:46:52,378
- There is a huge amount to do.
- We are four months behind.

121
00:46:52,589 --> 00:46:54,665
- You've got a great team.
- It's no longer about what you have left.

122
00:46:54,925 --> 00:46:58,128
- There will always be new product launches.
- Not us.

123
00:46:58,344 --> 00:47:00,966
Homma is to see over.

124
00:47:03,057 --> 00:47:05,133
Out of stock.

125
00:47:11,608 --> 00:47:14,609
How much time has passed?
Eight months?

126
00:47:16,613 --> 00:47:22,947
I still do not understand.
Just incomprehensible.

127
00:47:27,832 --> 00:47:34,001
Forget about the program.
We are worried about you.

128
00:47:34,214 --> 00:47:38,627
I'm worried about. You just
disappeared.

129
00:47:38,843 --> 00:47:41,417
I'm here.

130
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:56,817
It is no wonder that you're here.

131
00:48:08,623 --> 00:48:11,292
Not quite at their leisure.

132
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:13,134
Are you going to give up?

133
00:49:13,313 --> 00:49:20,561
- Where's the sail maker is?
- Across the street.

134
00:49:20,779 --> 00:49:23,270
In there?

135
00:49:26,117 --> 00:49:28,075
Thank you.

136
00:50:00,068 --> 00:50:04,196
We can not change the direction of the wind, the sail
but we can control. "

137
00:50:09,578 --> 00:50:14,453
I gave myself a good recommendation.
Sure.

138
00:50:16,292 --> 00:50:21,334
Well...  let's see what you got.

139
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:57,623
Bagpipes
can save a person's soul.

140
00:50:59,335 --> 00:51:01,494
- Do you like salmon?
- Yes.

141
00:51:01,713 --> 00:51:07,751
Good. We get Marie salmon.
An old family recipe.

142
00:51:09,263 --> 00:51:12,548
He may look like Hesperus
Norwegian fishing vessel.

143
00:51:12,766 --> 00:51:15,304
No. Well it is.

144
00:51:19,939 --> 00:51:26,820
I took the salad and wine
Marie's companion manual.

145
00:51:27,029 --> 00:51:31,941
- As long as you do not only brought tobacco.
- I stopped smoking.

146
00:51:32,202 --> 00:51:35,785
Really?
Then someone else to steal from me.

147
00:51:35,997 --> 00:51:42,249
- This time I'm serious.
- Good. Did you quit the drinking?

148
00:51:42,462 --> 00:51:47,005
- Do not be silly.
- Search glass. Raise a toast.

149
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:57,884
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

150
00:51:59,229 --> 00:52:04,852
Open the bottle, so
get up to speed.

151
00:52:06,402 --> 00:52:08,561
Where is your boat?

152
00:52:10,323 --> 00:52:12,565
Let me show you something, when we are
eaten.

153
00:52:23,962 --> 00:52:27,295
There it is. Marie.

154
00:52:27,507 --> 00:52:32,881
- Ongoing project.
- Really beautiful.

155
00:52:33,096 --> 00:52:37,592
My wife and I came to ten o'clock
years ago St Laurence River.

156
00:52:37,809 --> 00:52:40,929
We had to bypass the Great Lakes.

157
00:52:41,646 --> 00:52:47,649
Sailed Mackena Bay,
when he had a brain hemorrhage.

158
00:52:49,571 --> 00:52:53,354
We did not get to this place
further.

159
00:52:56,369 --> 00:53:01,281
I was last on the boat when I threw
Marie's ashes.

160
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:04,500
He has been in my heart ever since
.

161
00:53:07,505 --> 00:53:09,664
And I am grieved.

162
00:53:12,427 --> 00:53:16,009
I do not recommend the same for a young man of
.

163
00:53:51,591 --> 00:53:57,047
- Coffee?
- Breakfast, if that's okay.

164
00:53:59,057 --> 00:54:02,841
- Of course.
- Great.

165
00:54:13,363 --> 00:54:18,108
Hesperus is the evening star
spirit of Greek mythology.

166
00:54:19,243 --> 00:54:26,575
He first rose to -
Atlas mountain, but the storm brought him to -

167
00:54:27,461 --> 00:54:30,378
and he disappeared without a trace.

168
00:54:31,631 --> 00:54:37,504
Goodness of why he became a
-friendly evening star.

169
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:42,298
He gives every night nocturnal peace.

170
00:54:42,517 --> 00:54:48,390
- You're gonna always be here?
- I like it here. It is peaceful.

171
00:54:48,607 --> 00:54:54,645
The place is remote and people are
interesting.

172
00:54:54,863 --> 00:54:59,940
- Everywhere is the same thing.
- Water plays a role.

173
00:55:01,202 --> 00:55:07,455
I can go to Cape Town, South Africa
Mackena through the gulf -

174
00:55:07,668 --> 00:55:11,879
and continue the lakes and the sea
along the coasts of Nova Scotia.

175
00:55:12,172 --> 00:55:18,625
South east along the seashore, and
, then north, away from the golf stream.

176
00:55:19,554 --> 00:55:26,351
Panamankanavaa south along the trade winds and the
to Hawaii.

177
00:55:31,942 --> 00:55:36,817
Equatorial crack,
west of Fiji.

178
00:55:39,491 --> 00:55:42,776
For a while,
in Darwin Australia.

179
00:55:44,329 --> 00:55:49,453
Indian Ocean. Weather and ocean currents
must occur properly.

180
00:55:50,419 --> 00:55:55,579
Sailing 160 miles south of Madagascar in Durban.

181
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:06,970
Last piece of south-west along the coast of Africa.

182
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:15,273
One and a half years and 3,200 miles later, I am in Cape Town
.

183
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:29,496
- Are you going to do it sometime?
- I may have already done.

184
00:56:41,094 --> 00:56:45,423
The material is still late.
Just a few weeks.

185
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:49,091
A few weeks? A few weeks
was a few weeks ago.

186
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:52,928
- Time flies like the wings.
- Yes.

187
00:56:53,147 --> 00:56:57,857
When the season until you
you could do other stuff.

188
00:56:58,070 --> 00:57:03,574
- What?
- The cover boards need to hone.

189
00:57:03,783 --> 00:57:07,318
But it is not my
boat.

190
00:57:39,695 --> 00:57:42,482
He has slowed down the pace.

191
00:57:45,867 --> 00:57:48,239
We can help.

192
00:59:09,618 --> 00:59:12,369
Hello.

193
00:59:12,621 --> 00:59:14,779
What's up?

194
00:59:14,956 --> 00:59:18,407
- We made it here in the winter?
- I made it alive.

195
00:59:18,668 --> 00:59:22,286
- Boat starting to be okay.
- Yes. Slowly, but surely.

196
00:59:22,505 --> 00:59:26,419
You change the name.
It is no longer appropriate.

197
00:59:26,676 --> 00:59:33,260
Name begins to be known.
Are you going to stay for a while?

198
00:59:33,475 --> 00:59:39,727
Thought I'd
for a few weeks at the end. Calmness.

199
00:59:47,447 --> 00:59:51,944
Be careful.

200
00:59:53,787 --> 00:59:55,744
Great.

201
01:00:05,548 --> 01:00:09,961
Come on, sweetheart.
I'll see you later.

202
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:23,143
Dark and the light of day, between
when night begins to descend countries, -

203
01:00:23,358 --> 01:00:29,478
is the time to take a break day at work,
in children's hour.

204
01:00:33,535 --> 01:00:38,909
You are my forever.
Always and day, -

205
01:00:40,584 --> 01:00:46,953
The walls are damaged, decaying, and
flying away.

206
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:50,103
Are you okay?

207
01:03:58,448 --> 01:04:01,117
I should have known that he was ill
.

208
01:04:03,203 --> 01:04:08,541
We were on board.
Deep sea and distant islands.

209
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:12,582
Why do we sailed the Great Lakes Region
?

210
01:04:15,674 --> 01:04:18,461
It was his idea.

211
01:04:20,428 --> 01:04:28,174
He did not want to, that I would be alone in the sea
if something happens.

212
01:04:31,106 --> 01:04:36,183
He knew what was going to happen.
I do not even think about it.

213
01:04:40,824 --> 01:04:46,826
I should have guessed.
I would have been able to help.

214
01:04:49,999 --> 01:04:52,705
But I did not understand.

215
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:05,179
Bagpipes never
other things.

216
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:06,275
- Sounds around the clock.
- All over the world, all the time.

217
01:06:07,285 --> 01:06:10,120
There is a Grand Traverse.

218
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:13,912
The Indians hunted
canoe, and passed along Lake Michigan.

219
01:06:14,167 --> 01:06:19,245
Bay was a barrier. They paddled along the beach to the south of
-

220
01:06:19,423 --> 01:06:23,373
and to the north along the other shore
. Long way to go.

221
01:06:23,594 --> 01:06:27,887
Or they were able to walk half a mile coast to the open sea
-

222
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:33,382
Leelana-Peninsula,
a shorter distance, but the treacherous waters.

223
01:06:33,603 --> 01:06:39,357
When they left the continent, they saw the
of the peninsula from a distance.

224
01:06:39,567 --> 01:06:44,526
Indians said seats at
"Oh Me Nah I", a place far away.

225
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:49,448
French fur traders used the same route.

226
01:06:49,661 --> 01:06:54,702
They said it "Le Grande
Traversée" long route.

227
01:06:54,916 --> 01:07:01,120
Then came the other. Missionary,
continued, settlers, farmers.

228
01:07:01,339 --> 01:07:06,417
And finally came the tourists.
The name came from the Grand Traverse.

229
01:07:08,347 --> 01:07:14,515
I have to back row. If you start to blow, we can end up with
Magna country.

230
01:07:16,229 --> 01:07:18,767
Please wait. There is something for everyone.

231
01:07:32,788 --> 01:07:36,453
It's a Grand Traverse, son.

232
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:40,878
- What is it?
- All.

233
01:08:10,909 --> 01:08:13,317
I'm almost done.

234
01:08:15,747 --> 01:08:18,238
You are ready.

235
01:09:04,629 --> 01:09:07,298
It's really beautiful.

236
01:09:07,507 --> 01:09:11,207
Do you take it up the field?

237
01:09:15,349 --> 01:09:17,472
You should be.

238
01:09:24,316 --> 01:09:29,227
Sometimes when you are out there, what should be
, -

239
01:09:29,446 --> 01:09:32,316
it is too early.

240
01:11:21,516 --> 01:11:24,186
I left it on the counter.

241
01:11:25,938 --> 01:11:30,683
- Do not smoke?
- The burner package yesterday to finish.

242
01:11:36,781 --> 01:11:41,075
The two happiest days in a sailor's life
.

243
01:11:49,044 --> 01:11:54,963
You are a prisoner of the fortress,
and I will not let you leave.

244
01:11:55,175 --> 01:12:00,798
I'll put you in my heart
a round into the chamber of the tower.

245
01:13:26,516 --> 01:13:29,089
Do not be angry, but change the name of
.

246
01:13:32,605 --> 01:13:38,893
Hesperus as the evening star is the spirit that will bring peace to the night
, -

247
01:13:39,112 --> 01:13:41,734
Greek mythology.

248
01:13:43,241 --> 01:13:45,815
If you say so.

249
01:13:53,418 --> 01:13:59,172
- Please. As we agreed.
- No it did not have to be certified.

250
01:13:59,383 --> 01:14:05,006
I do not want to lose this, and
I know the situation, in this condition.

251
01:14:09,726 --> 01:14:12,133
Do not forget that.

252
01:14:16,692 --> 01:14:21,934
It belongs to the boat.

253
01:14:29,371 --> 01:14:36,785
<i> And a half years, 2,700 miles,
and I am in Cape Town. </ I>

254
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:43,540
<i> - Are you going to do it sometime?
- I may have already done it. </ I>

255
01:14:46,847 --> 01:14:51,140
- Good luck.
-, Too.

256
01:14:51,141 --> 01:14:52,141
- PLAYER 25/04/2013 -
