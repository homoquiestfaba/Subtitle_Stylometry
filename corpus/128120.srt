1
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:33,459
Yes, Yuko

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,297
Nowjust get down from the bus

3
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:36,899
Where do you want to go

4
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:40,998
I got it, OK

5
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:42,904
Got it? Where?

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,019
Let's go shopping together

7
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,023
What do you want to buy

8
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:03,818
We must have juice and candy

9
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,521
But they are waiting
It's alright

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,433
Come on This...

11
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,437
What

12
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,335
No

13
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,005
What's up

14
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,741
I can't move

15
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,350
I can't go inside

16
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:34,418
Are you alright? Come on

17
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,064
No

18
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:43,567
No

19
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:27,669
Cursed

20
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,654
Welcome

21
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,609
How are you

22
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,975
Welcome

23
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:13,310
I am not a customer

24
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,918
I've made an appointment with your boss

25
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,679
Excuse me, where is Mr. Kitaura

26
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,322
He is in the office

27
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,014
I'm Ryoko in OK Mark

28
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:21,520
I want to see Mr. Kitaura Okay

29
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,025
You are too late

30
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,621
I've already waited for 30 minutes

31
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,033
It is ordinary

32
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:30,792
for small shopkeepers like us to wait

33
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,801
for people from big companies like you

34
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,997
Not such thing

35
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,801
The appointment should be at 2 o'clock

36
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,245
What's the point of standing there

37
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,547
Not even want to say 'Welcome'

38
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:05,569
Welcome

39
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:37,692
What

40
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,997
Do you want to persuade us to join your group

41
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,201
If you agree to join our group,

42
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,702
I promise to report it

43
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,102
to Mr. Tejima

44
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,903
Tejima? That good guy

45
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:49,582
How is that guy

46
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,106
He promised to visit us

47
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,784
when our store opens

48
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,713
He had an accident

49
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:55,879
Accident?

50
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,380
Did he die?

51
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,614
Not yet, but he was seriously wounded

52
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,123
How is it?

53
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,089
His legs are in great pain

54
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,490
How painful is it

55
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:06,528
Does it need to cut off the legs

56
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:07,825
Already cut off

57
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,132
It's two legs

58
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,529
Have both shanks been cut off

59
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,934
It's really serious

60
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,199
Did you hear that

61
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,239
Both shanks have been cut off

62
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:19,843
Then he can't walk anymore

63
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,341
Don't bother me

64
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,638
I'm watching closely on that part-time worker

65
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,444
If I pay less attention,

66
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:26,640
that girl

67
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,750
will take away the money

68
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,945
Can he still walk?

69
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,118
The situation...

70
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,224
How is it
Tell me quickly

71
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,328
Did he urinate on the bed

72
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,053
Is he in great pain
Does he look miserable

73
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,961
Please tell me

74
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,065
Let's go back to the merchandise

75
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,463
The sales volume of our goods

76
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,432
has been quite good

77
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,670
So I really don't want

78
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:49,967
to change the agent

79
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:51,240
If something wrong arises,

80
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,977
I think your company will not

81
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,679
help my small shop

82
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,380
Tejima had already told me

83
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,879
For your worriness,

84
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:58,947
that's why I come here today

85
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,482
I come here to explain to you in details

86
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,049
What's the point of explaining

87
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:05,390
All is the damn shit of your company

88
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,588
That stupid thing had already explained

89
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,563
That stupid thing?

90
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,288
That guy without shanks

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,594
He had already explained to us

92
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,583
Will you go?

93
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,479
Not yet

94
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,378
Your boss wants me to take stock

95
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,920
What a bad luck

96
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,821
Our headquarters will probably blame me

97
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:46,623
Excuse me, you are...

98
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,026
I am a part-time worker. My name is Nori

99
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,996
I only worked here for about a month

100
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:52,835
My name is Ryoko

101
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:54,504
I'm the staff of OK Mark

102
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,841
Does OK Mark want this shop

103
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:58,332
Yes

104
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,344
I want to persuade the owner
to join our group

105
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,754
It sounds good

106
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:12,249
Something like chargers of the
mobile phones can be put here

107
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,857
People can also draw money here

108
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,922
Customers usually don't come here

109
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,653
There are many reasons for this

110
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,059
It's better for the lights here

111
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,961
to be brighter

112
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,967
It's really a bit dark

113
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,380
I usually have a sort of
uncomfortable feeling

114
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,484
I have to go to the warehouse to take the stock

115
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,588
Try to finish it within three days

116
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,658
I will try my best

117
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:05,102
This shop really gives me a strange feeling

118
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:11,769
Mr. Kitaura?

119
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,038
Welcome

120
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,060
Welcome

121
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:43,761
Wait a minute

122
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,767
666 yen please, sir

123
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,467
It doesn't have any custormer here

124
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,441
Do you know why the people nearby

125
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:57,071
do not come to this shop

126
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,583
That's why I guess

127
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,342
here is still in stock

128
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:06,254
This thing has already
out of stock in other places

129
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,756
Understand

130
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:11,890
Excuse me Yes

131
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,563
I got 1000 yen from you, sir

132
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,562
Now give back 334 yen to you

133
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,304
Thank you

134
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,909
Than you for coming

135
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,079
Pick it up

136
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,288
Pick it up

137
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,661
Who

138
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,808
Pick it up

139
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,921
Thank you
Thank you very much

140
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,511
Good morning, Mr. Kitaura

141
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,704
How is it going

142
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,901
Stock-taking will probably
be finished within this week

143
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:59,303
Believe me

144
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:13,457
Something strange is around here

145
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:16,958
Can't you feel it

146
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:22,165
Yes

147
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,426
My aunt also told not to do part-time work

148
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,668
Does only Miss. Nori work here?

149
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,731
Only me and Omori who works on night shift

150
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:36,581
Do you think there are ghosts here

151
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:44,147
Because I always think that
I am watched by somebody

152
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,184
The shopkeeper and his wife are also strange

153
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,695
So I have to finish stock-taking
as soon as possible

154
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,668
If we are able to purchase this shop,

155
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,269
it will definitely look different

156
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,770
When all the lights are changed,

157
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,270
many customers would come

158
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,978
Then I won't find other part-time job

159
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,373
and wait for your good news

160
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,707
The pay would also be better

161
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,382
I will have it reviewed

162
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,489
I go to work then Okay

163
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,276
What is it

164
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:31,389
Excuse me

165
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,087
Could you please explain it

166
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,999
The expiry date of this food
was three years ago

167
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,603
It has already expired

168
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,468
Why do you still keep it in the warehouse

169
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,778
This kind of goods cannot be regarded

170
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,918
as the assets of the shop

171
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:02,085
Yes, Mr. Kitaura

172
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,331
Are you sick

173
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,303
Sick?

174
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,935
Are you feeling sick

175
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,736
What are you talking about

176
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:24,238
This lady is really strange

177
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,947
Just ignore her

178
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,046
Are you alright

179
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:32,917
What do you mean

180
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,952
I think it is you who have
problems with your mind

181
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,318
Please be quiet

182
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,054
This is my goods

183
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,630
Don't take it, you thief

184
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,060
You are too much, Mr. Kitaura

185
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:45,964
The goods has already expired

186
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:52,871
What's the matter

187
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:54,773
Look over there

188
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:57,942
What

189
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:18,803
It rushed to the glass

190
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:58,341
You go back first

191
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,106
Let me clean up the mess

192
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:01,237
Miss. Ryoko

193
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:03,246
You have just said that here is strange

194
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,816
Is it true
Not such thing, don't worry

195
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:07,109
If it really does,

196
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:08,717
Nori will also...

197
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:11,345
What will happen to me...

198
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,026
It would be alright

199
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,659
In OK Mark,

00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,164

You have to try your best to change this shop

203
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,670
Okay, please go

00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,870
Please don't stop me

205
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,343
What do you want

206
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,589
I want to clean up the filth

207
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:33,195
Honey
You have to clean it without a single mark

208
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:34,596

212
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,336
It is gloomy outside

213
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:19,703

You should not have time to buy food to eat

217
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:50,773
I buy it for you

218
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,375
I would be in trouble if somebody has found out

219
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,375
I pay it myself. What is to be afraid of

220
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:55,970

What's the matter

235
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:19,937
You ring me suddenly

236
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:21,643
Are you discharged from hospital

237
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,611

238
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:29,112

00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:37,256
Hello, Mr. Tejima

00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,272
There are many people

244
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,077

00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,805
Many people are walking
Miss. Ryoko

246
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:32,615
They are walking very fast

247
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,081
Mr. Tejima

248
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,415
I cannot hear very well

249
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,087
Why only me

250
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,692
Ioses both legs

251
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,696
Why only me

252
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:05,547
Don't you know

253
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:12,615
Only ghosts have no leg

254
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:19,052
Only ghosts have no leg

255
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:39,477
Hateful, hateful

256
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:49,783
Hateful, hateful, hateful, hateful

257
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,335
What's the matter

258
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:10,034
It seems that somebody is in the fridge

259
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:13,071
Is anybody inside

260
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:17,876
Maybe I just saw the wrong thing

261
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:20,378
It should not have anybody

262
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:24,550
That's right

263
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,381
Am I a bit nervous

264
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:36,195
Did you buy it again

265
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:42,705
Did you buy this just for me

266
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:44,197
No such thing

267
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:45,407
I'm a Christian

268
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,301

Omori

292
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:03,003
What's the matter

293
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,971
What's the matter

Nothing

295
00:44:12,584 --> 00:44:14,074
Before it is getting dark,

00:44:14,285 --> 00:44:15,616
Nori, you go home now

297
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:18,584

00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:16,176
it's very cold, very cold

299
00:45:19,484 --> 00:45:20,781
Do you have shampoo

300
00:45:21,686 --> 00:45:24,177

301
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,758

00:46:13,905 --> 00:46:15,338
I want to buy one more bun

00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:18,839
If so,

00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,840

310
00:46:24,549 --> 00:46:25,516
I keep you waiting

311
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,240
That's okay

312
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:31,121
Thank you for coming
What a beautiful store-assistant

313
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:32,620
Very cold

314
00:46:54,379 --> 00:46:56,370
You have a message

315
00:46:59,384 --> 00:47:02,251
Have you forgotten to bring your mobile phone

316
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:03,786
Where are you

317
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:05,847
Okay

318
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,680
I would go there later

319
00:47:08,092 --> 00:47:09,286
You wait for me there first

320
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,885
I long for your food

321
00:47:12,096 --> 00:47:13,654
Now I go to buy some desserts

322
00:47:22,807 --> 00:47:24,104
The police of Tanage county have arrested

323
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,606
the director of Gantang office,

324
00:47:26,811 --> 00:47:28,210
Konto,

325
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:29,707
who was suspected to kill
a four-year old child Tanage

326
00:47:29,914 --> 00:47:31,211
According to our investigation,

327
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:33,281
the suspect, Konto,

328
00:47:33,418 --> 00:47:34,976
suddenly became crazy

329
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:36,175
and killed his own dog

330
00:47:36,421 --> 00:47:39,015
near his own shop

331
00:47:39,123 --> 00:47:40,112
As Konto defended,

332
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:41,517
he only hit his dog

333
00:47:41,726 --> 00:47:42,522
with metal stick

334
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:43,921
as usual

335
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:45,685
He didn't know that a child would suddenly

336
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:47,297
go into the area

337
00:47:47,498 --> 00:47:48,988
It is reported that the people nearby

338
00:47:49,133 --> 00:47:51,897
heard Konto calling pupils as stupid thing

339
00:47:52,136 --> 00:47:53,535
And Konto always gets money by

340
00:47:53,738 --> 00:47:56,036
pursuing those cats and dogs
which are roaming around

341
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,140
He will tie them up and

342
00:47:58,342 --> 00:47:59,639
hit with metal stick

343
00:47:59,844 --> 00:48:01,835
Now the police are investigating

344
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,240
the above events for further details

345
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:07,042
Now comes the next news

346
00:48:07,418 --> 00:48:09,249
In Aogi of Yama county,

347
00:48:09,454 --> 00:48:12,252
the firemen has found

348
00:48:12,523 --> 00:48:13,854
a dead body of a 21-year old teenager,
Kinshi,

349
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:15,719
and his room-mate,

350
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,359
another 23-year old teenager, Kataoka,

351
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:20,861
At the beginning,

352
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:23,033
Kataoka was very agitated

353
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:25,735
But now the situation is under control

354
00:48:26,871 --> 00:48:28,964
Now the death of Kinshi

355
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:30,865
is being investigated

356
00:48:31,175 --> 00:48:33,040
The police have found out

357
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:34,539
a skull

358
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:36,146
and other bones at Kataoka's home

359
00:48:36,481 --> 00:48:38,676
After laboratory investigation,
Kinshi's skin tissues

360
00:48:38,883 --> 00:48:40,851
have been found on Kataoka

361
00:48:41,486 --> 00:48:43,351
The police are now investigating
for further details

362
00:48:43,855 --> 00:48:47,382
It is believed that this case
is directly related to Kataoka

363
00:48:47,692 --> 00:48:50,286
But since Kataoka was very agitated,

364
00:48:50,495 --> 00:48:53,191
the process of investigation was hindered

365
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:56,965
After he calms down,

366
00:48:57,802 --> 00:49:00,965
it is believed that he would be interrogated

367
00:49:01,506 --> 00:49:03,872
Maybe he would be brought back to the scene

368
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:05,598
and reorganized the case

369
00:49:06,511 --> 00:49:08,604
The police now put Kataoka into prison

370
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:10,275
and refuse bail

371
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:14,915
The above are Japanese news
and reported by Hirayama

372
00:49:40,912 --> 00:49:42,038
Is anybody there

373
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:12,933
Why nobody is there

374
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:21,779
Something is strange

375
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:03,435
I'm alright

376
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:09,724
Madam, do you walk past here every day

377
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,934
Are you their relatives

378
01:01:13,237 --> 01:01:14,829
No

379
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:17,833
Then come with me

380
01:01:19,243 --> 01:01:21,234
Here is not a good place to talk

381
01:01:21,645 --> 01:01:22,907
What's the matter

382
01:02:00,284 --> 01:02:03,879
It's better for the shop to close down

383
01:02:04,855 --> 01:02:06,652
The shopkeeper has already

384
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:08,553
changed to several people

385
01:02:09,693 --> 01:02:12,287
Not a single one can keep going

386
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:14,796
Each one also becomes very strange

387
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:16,460
Strange

388
01:02:16,767 --> 01:02:17,995
You also think so

389
01:02:18,702 --> 01:02:21,796
That couple doesn't look like normal persons

390
01:02:26,677 --> 01:02:28,611
That land is the root of the problem

391
01:02:29,012 --> 01:02:30,001
That land?

392
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:34,106
When a person buys the land,

393
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,711
he would become reluctant
to communicate with others

394
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:41,113
Iike that couple

395
01:02:42,326 --> 01:02:44,487
Then there would even have murders

396
01:03:13,724 --> 01:03:16,557
Sometimes mankind is really cunning

397
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:20,152
In order to achieve their aims,

398
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:22,758
they would hurt themselves deliberately

399
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:24,456
and cheat for insurance compensation

400
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:27,862
This kind of people deserve punishment

401
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:31,668
What are you saying? Derserve punishment

402
01:03:34,745 --> 01:03:36,474
That shop is not made by

403
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:38,839
ordinary material

404
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:41,673
What material do you guess

405
01:03:42,586 --> 01:03:44,144
Not ordinary material?

406
01:03:45,355 --> 01:03:49,485
Mankind is really greedy

407
01:03:49,793 --> 01:03:52,694
The shop is not made by cement

408
01:03:52,963 --> 01:03:54,487
but the graves nearby

409
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:55,892
They broke the graves

410
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:58,693
and mixed the debris with other materials

411
01:03:59,703 --> 01:04:01,671
The boss of that construction company

412
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:03,905
also died in a strange way

413
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:09,609
It serves him right

414
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:44,745
Miss. Ryoko

415
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:47,414
You also know that it is strange

416
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:52,920
I want you to tell me

417
01:04:53,457 --> 01:04:55,254
If I were you,

418
01:04:55,525 --> 01:04:57,152
I wouldn't pretend not to see anything

419
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,123
and not to feel anything

420
01:04:59,162 --> 01:05:00,629
If so,

421
01:05:00,964 --> 01:05:02,329
I would rather accept myself

422
01:05:02,532 --> 01:05:04,762
to have such special power, right

423
01:05:06,169 --> 01:05:07,659
I can listen to them

424
01:05:08,472 --> 01:05:09,769
touch them

425
01:05:10,941 --> 01:05:12,875
Of course can even look at them

426
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:14,635
Now

427
01:05:15,779 --> 01:05:18,839
I am always able to see

428
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:21,641
Well

429
01:05:23,153 --> 01:05:24,381
But

430
01:05:24,888 --> 01:05:27,049
I will try to pretend not to see anything

431
01:05:28,492 --> 01:05:30,858
even though it is wrong to do so

432
01:05:30,994 --> 01:05:32,188
I have my own opinion

433
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:33,853
I will not think much about ghosts

434
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:35,496
Really

435
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,701
I think maybe because
I have done something bad

436
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:42,464
It is a retribution

437
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,298
So I am able to see those strange things

438
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:50,279
Nori, when you encounter
some strange things,

439
01:05:50,514 --> 01:05:52,209
do you have such thought?

440
01:05:54,084 --> 01:05:55,711
Maybe

441
01:05:56,486 --> 01:06:00,013
But other people really cannot see anything

442
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:08,029
In fact there are some other things
which are not able to explain by logic

443
01:06:11,034 --> 01:06:14,697
The issue itself may not be on Nori or me

444
01:06:14,838 --> 01:06:17,136
These things are beyond
the control of mankind after all

445
01:06:17,741 --> 01:06:22,235
So we don't need to think about
why there are strange things to happen

446
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:27,139
But just to face it
when these things have happened

447
01:06:27,551 --> 01:06:28,950
Do you really think in this way

448
01:06:29,252 --> 01:06:30,549
Miss. Ryoko

449
01:06:32,556 --> 01:06:34,353
You would feel better
if you could think like this

450
01:06:34,858 --> 01:06:37,156
Maybe you won't agree with me

451
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,520
But...

452
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:41,424
I would be very worried

453
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:47,261
Sometimes it sounds like
I'm thinking too much

454
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:49,869
I would feel better

455
01:06:50,073 --> 01:06:53,133
if just regard it as an ordinary thing

456
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:54,768
What do you mean

457
01:06:55,145 --> 01:06:57,670
And the issue is not on me

458
01:06:58,181 --> 01:07:01,173
To regard it as an ordinary thing,

459
01:07:01,585 --> 01:07:05,351
do you want to tell me these principles

460
01:07:29,112 --> 01:07:30,977
You better quit that part-time job

461
01:07:31,815 --> 01:07:33,407
Got it, Nori

462
01:08:46,089 --> 01:08:47,249
Omori

463
01:10:04,067 --> 01:10:04,965
Omori

464
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:07,627
Omori

465
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:10,062
Omori

466
01:10:19,749 --> 01:10:20,681
Omori

467
01:10:34,264 --> 01:10:35,390
Omori

468
01:10:38,101 --> 01:10:39,193
Omori

469
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:49,469
Omori

470
01:11:10,333 --> 01:11:11,698
Omori

471
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:14,801
Omori

472
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:47,658
Omori

473
01:11:49,572 --> 01:11:52,973
Omori...

474
01:11:55,278 --> 01:11:59,078
Omori...

475
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:48,746
Go back

476
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:28,884
Hello

477
01:15:29,392 --> 01:15:31,087
Many people

478
01:15:31,294 --> 01:15:33,057
are here

479
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:48,973
Hello, Mr. Tejima

480
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:14,394
Mr. Tejima

481
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:38,559
Here is quite good

482
01:16:39,862 --> 01:16:43,923
All are without legs

483
01:17:02,285 --> 01:17:03,775
Mr. Tejima

484
01:17:05,288 --> 01:17:07,051
Thank you for your care

485
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:09,155
for so long

486
01:17:12,762 --> 01:17:13,786
Goodbye

487
01:18:05,615 --> 01:18:07,048
Okay

488
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:11,847
Is Yuko

489
01:18:12,355 --> 01:18:13,617
I just get down from the bus

490
01:18:13,656 --> 01:18:15,419
Where do you want to go to buy things

491
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:18,152
I got it, OK

492
01:18:22,732 --> 01:18:25,132
Go with me. It's beautiful
Where

493
01:18:25,368 --> 01:18:27,666
Quick Okay

494
01:18:36,779 --> 01:18:40,772
Oh! No, I can't move

495
01:18:41,751 --> 01:18:43,548
My legs cannot move

496
01:18:44,287 --> 01:18:46,084
What's the matter

497
01:18:49,992 --> 01:18:54,452
No...

498
01:21:40,031 --> 01:21:42,226
Ladies and gentlemen

499
01:21:42,433 --> 01:21:43,832
I'm Sato

500
01:21:44,669 --> 01:21:46,193
The shooting of Cursed

501
01:21:46,337 --> 01:21:48,737
is finally finished. Thank you

502
01:21:49,507 --> 01:21:51,168
The first time I saw the film

503
01:21:51,342 --> 01:21:53,572
was on a small television

504
01:21:54,379 --> 01:21:56,108
Though the screen is small,

505
01:21:56,481 --> 01:21:59,143
some scary scenes in the film

506
01:21:59,384 --> 01:22:01,147
are enough to frighten me

507
01:22:01,719 --> 01:22:04,984
This is a very scary film

508
01:22:05,523 --> 01:22:10,483
I also scared when the film was shooting

509
01:22:10,862 --> 01:22:13,126
Don't you have the same feeling with me

510
01:22:13,197 --> 01:22:16,166
Let's see the titbits of the film

511
01:22:21,272 --> 01:22:25,072
Thank you

512
01:22:27,378 --> 01:22:32,247
What do you want to say

513
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:37,517
The film has almost finished shooting

514
01:22:37,956 --> 01:22:44,589
It will be finished very soon

515
01:22:49,033 --> 01:22:54,198
I really feel a bit unhappy about that

516
01:22:54,906 --> 01:23:00,276
While the film is being shot,
I have been very happy

517
01:23:00,511 --> 01:23:03,173
If the film has finished shooting,

518
01:23:03,581 --> 01:23:06,015
I will have a sense of loneliness

519
01:23:08,086 --> 01:23:13,524
I really want to keep working with the staff

520
01:23:14,492 --> 01:23:18,861
What did you feel
when you first saw the script

521
01:23:19,130 --> 01:23:23,533
When I first saw the script,

522
01:23:25,003 --> 01:23:34,639
I found the beginning quite straightforward

523
01:23:35,246 --> 01:23:40,650
But having the experience of
being a store-assistant,

524
01:23:42,687 --> 01:23:50,059
it is still valuable to me

525
01:23:52,397 --> 01:24:02,033
At the beginning, I was not that concentrated

526
01:24:02,907 --> 01:24:08,846
but later it was greatly improved

527
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:15,544
I think I am going to be a good actor

528
01:24:17,989 --> 01:24:21,516
Do you watch scary films

529
01:24:21,793 --> 01:24:23,693
No

530
01:24:23,895 --> 01:24:27,228
When I see some scary scenes,

531
01:24:27,398 --> 01:24:29,992
I would be very frightened

532
01:24:30,468 --> 01:24:36,839
I would immediatedly use
my hands to cover my face

533
01:24:39,710 --> 01:24:43,737
When did you first go to funerals

534
01:24:44,182 --> 01:24:47,379
I went to funerals before

535
01:24:47,618 --> 01:24:50,212
I will try my best

536
01:24:51,789 --> 01:24:55,885
Is there anything that is
particularly hard to you

537
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:59,454
It is that

538
01:24:59,831 --> 01:25:03,767
I had to get used to many new things

539
01:25:04,869 --> 01:25:07,929
at the beginning

540
01:25:08,072 --> 01:25:14,944
I was not used to at the beginning

541
01:25:15,213 --> 01:25:18,614
Did you seek advice from other people

542
01:25:19,350 --> 01:25:23,650
I did seek advice from my seniors

543
01:25:24,822 --> 01:25:28,918
I once hurt my finger carelessly

544
01:25:30,328 --> 01:25:34,526
I was very worried

545
01:25:35,333 --> 01:25:38,598
but my seniors always encouraged me

546
01:25:38,936 --> 01:25:43,100
I am very grateful to them

547
01:25:45,843 --> 01:25:48,539
What do you think

548
01:25:49,514 --> 01:25:53,177
I will try other films as well

549
01:25:53,885 --> 01:25:55,546
and will work very hard

550
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:57,253
to train my acting

551
01:25:58,556 --> 01:26:00,854
Please continue to give me encouragement

552
01:26:06,063 --> 01:26:08,054
I'm Sato

553
01:26:09,467 --> 01:26:14,166
This story is about

554
01:26:14,939 --> 01:26:20,343
many scary things keep on
happening in a store

555
01:26:20,845 --> 01:26:22,836
The story is really excellent

556
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:27,176
Please feel free to give suggestions

557
01:26:54,246 --> 01:26:55,736
Mankind is the most terrible creature
Don't you know that

558
01:26:56,081 --> 01:26:57,878
There are lots of people around us
What kind of people would you meet?

559
01:26:58,250 --> 01:26:59,774
Maybe he would become
hysterical in front of you

560
01:27:00,685 --> 01:27:02,152
Who? Who?

561
01:27:13,164 --> 01:27:14,096
The scary legend of city

562
01:27:14,366 --> 01:27:16,197
finally becomes a movie

563
01:27:19,571 --> 01:27:24,201
Tokyo Psycho

564
01:27:24,809 --> 01:27:26,276
A young writer with freshness

565
01:27:26,611 --> 01:27:30,308
It's written by Hirayama

566
01:27:30,682 --> 01:27:32,775
the new launch of

567
01:27:33,184 --> 01:27:35,482
director Tomie, Katagawachu

568
01:27:35,887 --> 01:27:38,685
What do you want to tell me?

569
01:27:41,793 --> 01:27:43,590
I have forgotten

570
01:27:43,995 --> 01:27:45,929
Oh! Yes

571
01:27:46,598 --> 01:27:50,500
I have important thing to tell you

572
01:27:50,902 --> 01:27:53,302
I have also just got it

573
01:27:55,307 --> 01:28:00,609
We've found lgumi's present address

574
01:28:01,846 --> 01:28:04,610
Please blame me louder

575
01:28:05,016 --> 01:28:07,109
I like to hear those words

576
01:28:07,319 --> 01:28:08,718
It feels good

577
01:28:09,821 --> 01:28:13,416
This city is covered with craziness

578
01:28:19,331 --> 01:28:20,423
It is adapted from real cases

579
01:28:20,732 --> 01:28:22,131
The craziest, abnormal criminal

580
01:28:22,467 --> 01:28:23,832
No

581
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:41,850
Coming slowly from beautiful girls

582
01:28:42,454 --> 01:28:45,855
It is hard to believe

583
01:28:46,057 --> 01:28:50,551
Everything becomes crazy

584
01:28:54,366 --> 01:28:55,390
In this city

585
01:28:55,767 --> 01:28:57,359
if you are not crazy

586
01:28:57,802 --> 01:29:01,101
you will die
