to get out of their way

877
00:49:24,375 --> 00:49:25,771
when they come into the dome.

878
00:49:25,795 --> 00:49:27,942
The restaurant
is called Starved.

879
00:49:27,966 --> 00:49:32,158
What we do, we lock you in
a dark room for 48 hours, right?

880
00:49:32,182 --> 00:49:34,872
No light, no food, no water.
It's wet.

881
00:49:34,896 --> 00:49:37,628
I'd take your clothes if I
could, but that'd be illegal.

882
00:49:37,652 --> 00:49:39,882
Actually surprised,
'cause this is

883
00:49:39,906 --> 00:49:42,847
kind of new for you
and your natural lifestyle.

884
00:49:42,871 --> 00:49:46,353
Oh, well, I do dabble sometimes,

885
00:49:46,377 --> 00:49:50,904
but just with plant drugs, so...

886
00:49:50,928 --> 00:49:52,575
I let you out.

887
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:56,541
And I give you
one single red ripe tomato.

888
00:49:56,565 --> 00:49:57,835
Ah.

889
00:49:57,859 --> 00:49:59,881
One tomato.

890
00:49:59,905 --> 00:50:01,926
That's it?

891
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:03,805
Exactly.

892
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:06,936
Yeah, this is a...
What is it? Cacao plant?

893
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,105
Is that what it is?

894
00:50:08,129 --> 00:50:09,525
Oh, that's chocolate.

895
00:50:09,549 --> 00:50:11,613
Oh, I definitely...
I can't have chocolate.

896
00:50:11,637 --> 00:50:13,115
That's very bad for me.

897
00:50:13,139 --> 00:50:17,248
So this is <i>coco,</i> from Colombia.

898
00:50:17,272 --> 00:50:18,627
Okay.

899
00:50:18,651 --> 00:50:21,381
I'm so happy we found love,
because...

900
00:50:21,405 --> 00:50:23,052
Man, I don't know about you,
Josh,

901
00:50:23,076 --> 00:50:24,806
but when Lex and I broke up,
I was...

902
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:26,433
I mean... Fucking destroyed.

903
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:28,145
Devastated. Fucking destroyed.

904
00:50:28,169 --> 00:50:30,399
And the chemical connection
we had was out of this world.

905
00:50:30,423 --> 00:50:33,280
She said to me, and, you know,
we've talked about this.

906
00:50:33,304 --> 00:50:36,538
She said that, sexually, she'd
never been satisfied by anyone

907
00:50:36,562 --> 00:50:38,750
the way that, you know,
I had, but...

908
00:50:38,774 --> 00:50:40,879
I think she said that
to everybody.

909
00:50:40,903 --> 00:50:42,006
Best sex of my life.

910
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:43,283
Come here.

911
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:50,732
You're great. I miss you.
[LAUGHS]

912
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,528
I miss you too. Yeah.

913
00:50:52,552 --> 00:50:53,947
You know, you always think

914
00:50:53,971 --> 00:50:55,659
you're gonna be
one of those moms.

915
00:50:55,683 --> 00:50:57,412
"No, everything's gonna be
the same.

916
00:50:57,436 --> 00:51:00,586
I'm just gonna have this new
person in my life." But no.

917
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:03,173
No. Different place.
The world is a different place.

918
00:51:03,197 --> 00:51:04,594
My eyes have been opened.

919
00:51:04,618 --> 00:51:07,808
Yes. I mean,
before I adopted Levi,

920
00:51:07,832 --> 00:51:10,522
I was so selfish, you know?

921
00:51:10,546 --> 00:51:11,524
Yeah. I know.

922
00:51:11,548 --> 00:51:13,528
And now, I mean,

923
00:51:13,552 --> 00:51:15,991
everything I do
is for everybody else.

924
00:51:16,015 --> 00:51:17,059
Sure. So I get it.

925
00:51:20,065 --> 00:51:23,673
Are you sure you're actually
wanting to have a baby?

926
00:51:23,697 --> 00:51:24,699
Yes.

927
00:51:25,993 --> 00:51:28,349
Okay. Yes. Yeah.

928
00:51:28,373 --> 00:51:31,731
That's very good, 'cause,
you know, it's like suicide.

929
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,693
What?

930
00:51:33,717 --> 00:51:37,200
Well, you know, things you can't
undo in your life.

931
00:51:37,224 --> 00:51:41,668
Okay. Having a baby,
committing suicide,

932
00:51:41,692 --> 00:51:44,698
renouncing your US citizenship
for a dream.

933
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:49,265
So you're sure? I'm sure. Yeah.

934
00:51:49,289 --> 00:51:51,896
Okay. Okay.
Why do you keep...? Yes.

935
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,067
I don't know. There's an energy
I want multiple.

936
00:51:54,091 --> 00:51:57,198
I'm getting
that's just a little resistant.

937
00:51:57,222 --> 00:51:59,495
MIA: There was this one
case, Gerard Watkins.

938
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:02,250
It was an attempted robbery.

939
00:52:02,274 --> 00:52:06,341
He killed a guy in a convenience
store and it was just...

940
00:52:06,365 --> 00:52:09,557
I was like, "Yeah, but does he
deserve to die for that?"

941
00:52:09,581 --> 00:52:12,145
And, you know,
we fought for him.

942
00:52:12,169 --> 00:52:14,149
He got a lighter sentence.

943
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:16,236
He's still around.

944
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:20,829
And then I was like, "Wait
a second. A man was murdered.

945
00:52:20,853 --> 00:52:26,173
He has a mom. He was once a baby
in that mom's arms."

946
00:52:26,197 --> 00:52:29,095
[SCOFFS] Gerard should've died.

947
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:31,433
And that man's mom
should have watched him die,

948
00:52:31,457 --> 00:52:36,109
and she should have decided
how painful it gets to be.

949
00:52:36,133 --> 00:52:38,865
Like, you know that
death rattle they talk about?

950
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:41,913
She should have gotten
to feel the death rattle.

951
00:52:41,937 --> 00:52:44,316
My husband will never
not be sweating.

952
00:52:46,738 --> 00:52:48,050
He's a little moist, yeah.

953
00:52:48,074 --> 00:52:50,722
We moved to an island,

954
00:52:50,746 --> 00:52:54,772
and now he's just
forever dripping.

955
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:57,820
[LAUGHS] Yeah.
And you laugh, but honestly,

956
00:52:57,844 --> 00:53:00,241
we're having problems
sexually because of it.

957
00:53:00,265 --> 00:53:02,161
I don't know
what it is down here.

958
00:53:02,185 --> 00:53:04,792
If it's the heat,

959
00:53:04,816 --> 00:53:10,201
or if it's the stress of running
a hospitality business, or...

960
00:53:14,126 --> 00:53:17,191
if it's just something
she's been eating.

961
00:53:17,215 --> 00:53:20,556
But it's gotten worse...

962
00:53:21,975 --> 00:53:26,776
and worse and worse,
and now it's really like...

963
00:53:28,112 --> 00:53:30,301
It's as if we're about
to be intimate

964
00:53:30,325 --> 00:53:33,600
and my husband's
just been through a carwash,

965
00:53:33,624 --> 00:53:36,188
but his body is the car.

966
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:37,548
And I just...

967
00:53:39,761 --> 00:53:44,580
For me, my arousal
goes to an all-time low.

968
00:53:44,604 --> 00:53:47,711
And it's funny because he's
the wettest he's ever been

969
00:53:47,735 --> 00:53:49,363
and I couldn't be drier.

970
00:53:51,534 --> 00:53:54,666
I just miss the old smell
of my wife's vagina.

971
00:54:05,562 --> 00:54:06,690
I hate my life.

972
00:54:07,817 --> 00:54:09,505
What? I just...

973
00:54:09,529 --> 00:54:13,638
I wish sometimes that I could
just be in the middle of a mall.

974
00:54:13,662 --> 00:54:17,103
I wanna go to the movies and
I wanna watch a Marvel movie.

975
00:54:17,127 --> 00:54:18,797
And I wanna root for the...

976
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:23,598
The man who flies who's red.
The...

977
00:54:25,226 --> 00:54:28,751
Superman.
I wanna root for Superman.

978
00:54:28,775 --> 00:54:31,447
Yeah, no. Yeah.
And wear deodorant or...

979
00:54:32,575 --> 00:54:34,888
Well, I wear deodorant.

980
00:54:34,912 --> 00:54:36,726
Yes. No, I know.

981
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:37,936
And I love my deodorant.

982
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,773
I would never put aluminum
on my body.

983
00:54:39,797 --> 00:54:41,777
No, no, no, no, no.

984
00:54:41,801 --> 00:54:46,077
I make it with this arrowroot
powder and a hint of mint.

985
00:54:46,101 --> 00:54:49,208
Oh...
And there's a coconut base...

986
00:54:49,232 --> 00:54:51,821
I can make you some,
if you'd like.

987
00:54:53,282 --> 00:54:56,557
Yes. Thank you.

988
00:54:56,581 --> 00:54:58,310
JOSH: It smells so bad.

989
00:54:58,334 --> 00:55:00,272
Have you ever tried
durian fruit?

990
00:55:00,296 --> 00:55:02,986
All right. It's experimental,
but I know it does work.

991
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:04,656
Try turmeric paste.

992
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,326
You're gonna have to apply it
directly to the labia.

993
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:10,292
Okay. Okay. All right.
We're done.

994
00:55:10,316 --> 00:55:12,839
I don't wanna have
this conversation anymore.

995
00:55:12,863 --> 00:55:14,510
It makes me uncomfortable.

996
00:55:14,534 --> 00:55:16,388
So I would appreciate it if we

997
00:55:16,412 --> 00:55:18,768
wouldn't talk about
our wives' vaginas.

998
00:55:18,792 --> 00:55:20,546
Please? Thank you.

999
00:55:22,048 --> 00:55:24,386
I'm gonna be honest with you,
Josh, like...

1000
00:55:25,639 --> 00:55:27,159
Women at an early age are taught

1001
00:55:27,183 --> 00:55:29,163
to be ashamed of their vaginas,

1002
00:55:29,187 --> 00:55:32,169
so it kind of felt like you were
doing some misogynistic attack.

1003
00:55:32,193 --> 00:55:35,217
How would you like if your wife
made fun of your smelly dick?

1004
00:55:35,241 --> 00:55:37,597
If you had a smelly dick.
How would it make you feel?

1005
00:55:37,621 --> 00:55:39,810
Would it make you feel bad?
It'd make you feel bad?

1006
00:55:39,834 --> 00:55:41,128
Don't touch me, man!

1007
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:46,532
You, the idea for your
restaurant is morally offensive.

1008
00:55:46,556 --> 00:55:47,868
Move.

1009
00:55:47,892 --> 00:55:49,896
Fuck. What the fuck?

1010
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:57,536
LEX: Can I sit here?

1011
00:56:04,299 --> 00:56:05,552
I'm sorry.

1012
00:56:07,681 --> 00:56:10,037
I'm so sorry.

1013
00:56:10,061 --> 00:56:12,273
I don't even have the words,
really, to...

1014
00:56:16,741 --> 00:56:18,578
say how sorry that I am.

1015
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:27,363
But I'm totally fine if you
don't want me to write the vows,

1016
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:29,892
or even come to the ceremony.

1017
00:56:37,533 --> 00:56:39,494
Ah!

1018
00:56:40,664 --> 00:56:42,644
[SHUSHING]

1019
00:56:42,668 --> 00:56:49,198
Lex? Lex? I love you.
I love you.

1020
00:56:49,222 --> 00:56:52,121
Lex, I love you.

1021
00:56:52,145 --> 00:56:55,628
And one day you're gonna have
your own beautiful baby.

1022
00:56:55,652 --> 00:56:56,672
You are.

1023
00:56:56,696 --> 00:56:59,636
I know it. I know these things.

1024
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:05,607
And I'm gonna be the godmother,
because who else would it be?

1025
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:08,445
And you have to write the vows.

1026
00:57:08,469 --> 00:57:11,350
Who else
is gonna write the vows?

1027
00:57:12,519 --> 00:57:14,248
Me? Yeah.

1028
00:57:14,272 --> 00:57:16,795
You're gonna write the vows,

1029
00:57:16,819 --> 00:57:19,801
'cause you can't
let me down again.

1030
00:57:19,825 --> 00:57:22,330
You can't cross Mia twice.

1031
00:57:24,042 --> 00:57:27,817
And I love you. I do. But...
I love you.

1032
00:57:27,841 --> 00:57:30,364
I miss what we had physically.

1033
00:57:30,388 --> 00:57:33,829
I know. I know.
I see it in your eyes.

1034
00:57:33,853 --> 00:57:37,629
But, Lex, I'm getting married.

1035
00:57:37,653 --> 00:57:39,382
Oh... I'm getting married.

1036
00:57:39,406 --> 00:57:42,388
So you're gonna write the vows,

1037
00:57:42,412 --> 00:57:48,257
and we're gonna have
those memories forever.

1038
00:57:51,597 --> 00:57:53,994
Okay? Yeah.

1039
00:57:54,018 --> 00:57:56,774
Mia, where's the gun?

1040
00:57:58,444 --> 00:58:02,512
Don't worry about the gun.
The gun is safe.

1041
00:58:02,536 --> 00:58:04,516
I put the gun...

1042
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:08,422
The gun knows where it is.
It's safe.

1043
00:58:23,035 --> 00:58:25,390
It's so pretty.

1044
00:58:25,414 --> 00:58:26,810
Yeah.

1045
00:58:26,834 --> 00:58:28,313
You okay?

1046
00:58:28,337 --> 00:58:32,237
