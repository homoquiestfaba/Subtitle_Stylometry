00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,534
{Men shouting
in Asian language}

2
00:01:01,174 --> 00:01:03,909
{Speaking Asian language}

3
00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:35,207
{Dog barking in distance}

4
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:45,784
{Men speaking Asian language}

5
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:22,722
{All shouting}

6
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:35,267
{Screaming}

7
00:03:11,838 --> 00:03:14,640
- Ah!

8
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:35,994
- Go!

9
00:04:51,972 --> 00:04:54,139
- I would hazard our friends,

10
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:55,808
the Hong merchants,

11
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,744
are prospering under
your able governorship,

12
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:00,579
my friend?

13
00:05:02,382 --> 00:05:06,151
- They grow rich and
show their appreciation.

14
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:10,422
But there is one last fly
that buzzes around my face.

15
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,192
Reverend Elders
grows too bold.

16
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:17,229
- He'll be dealt with before
the next shipment arrives.

17
00:05:17,297 --> 00:05:18,364
{Door opening}

18
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:19,931
Ah!

19
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,467
- Oh, the lovely Priscilla!

20
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:25,137
- Forgive the intrusion, Father.
I just wanted

21
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:26,304
to bid you goodnight.

22
00:05:26,372 --> 00:05:28,574
- That's my girl.
Now to bed.

23
00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:33,612
The Governor and I have
dreary business to discuss.

24
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,113
- Goodnight.

25
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:36,849
- Sleep well, my darling.

26
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:41,253
Dream beautiful dreams.

27
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:43,655
{Speaking Asian language}

28
00:05:58,705 --> 00:06:00,372
- Ah, Reverend Elders!

29
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,275
Speak of the devil.

30
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:04,744
- Your Lordship.

31
00:06:04,811 --> 00:06:09,014
I must appeal to you.
This must stop.

32
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:11,716
Smuggling opium,

33
00:06:11,784 --> 00:06:14,419
kidnapping villagers for
transport to forced labour...

34
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:16,322
- We're doing nothing wrong.

35
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:20,058
In fact, under the Treaty of
Lorcha, it's entirely legal.

36
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:22,627
- I know you're selling
British Army rifles

37
00:06:22,695 --> 00:06:25,030
to the Hong merchants.

38
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:30,869
- Now, that is a serious charge.

39
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:33,305
- My only consolation

40
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:36,475
is the knowledge that
tonight's opium shipment

41
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,777
lies at the bottom
of the harbour.

42
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:45,017
He is setting up

43
00:06:45,085 --> 00:06:46,885
his own private army.

44
00:06:46,953 --> 00:06:50,122
- A detail we don't need public.

45
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,491
- I shall see to it

46
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:55,528
that every MP
and every newspaper

47
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:57,763
here and in England

48
00:06:57,831 --> 00:06:59,665
knows the true story.

49
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:03,535
- I'm afraid you won't,
Reverend.

50
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:07,807
We can't have Heaven interfering

51
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:09,708
with our earthly plans.

52
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,212
Business will go on.

53
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,981
You, unfortunately,

54
00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:17,782
will not.

55
00:07:19,152 --> 00:07:20,553
{Grunting}

56
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,154
Wait.

57
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:26,992
{Groaning}

58
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:31,396
Before you die,

59
00:07:31,464 --> 00:07:33,732
let me assure you

60
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,301
that I am not without feeling.

61
00:07:37,937 --> 00:07:40,572
I would not send you
from this world alone.

62
00:07:44,978 --> 00:07:46,344
Your son...

63
00:07:46,412 --> 00:07:49,581
will follow you tonight.

64
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:50,883
{Grunting}

65
00:07:52,852 --> 00:07:54,386
{Knife dropping}

66
00:07:59,092 --> 00:08:01,827
This is the third such
ambush in as many months.

67
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:04,864
Opium is the currency
of our business,

68
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:09,735
and I will tolerate no more
meddling in my affairs.

69
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,653
{Jonathan speaking
Asian language}

70
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:31,556

{Banging on door}

72
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,628
- Come here.

73
00:08:36,696 --> 00:08:38,697
Chu-Shu, keep an eye on him.

74
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:40,699
{Banging continues}

75
00:08:43,503 --> 00:08:44,803
Chu-Shu, go and get Chen.
Quickly!

76
00:08:51,244 --> 00:08:52,945
There, quickly.

77
00:08:53,013 --> 00:08:55,414
- What's happening?
{Glass shattering}

78
00:08:56,883 --> 00:08:59,618
- Stay here no matter what.
Promise?

79
00:08:59,686 --> 00:09:01,019
- Promise.

80
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:04,856
{Crashing}

81
00:09:04,924 --> 00:09:07,759
{Dog barking}

82
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:23,508
- The boy, where is he?

83
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:26,344
- He isn't here.
He's staying with a friend.

84
00:09:32,017 --> 00:09:33,919
{Banging}

85
00:09:44,164 --> 00:09:47,299
- You think you can fool me,
woman?

86
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:49,100
I'll ask you once more.

87
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:51,370
Where's the boy?

88
00:09:57,377 --> 00:09:59,144
- He's away.

89
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:00,812
- Where's the boy? Speak!

90
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,313
- He's away!

91
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,086
{Grunting}

92
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:09,788
{Ding screaming}

93
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:14,693
{Gasping}

94
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,562
- Tell me!
Where is he?

95
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:21,933
Ah! You have spirit.

96
00:10:22,035 --> 00:10:24,169
It will be useful
in the next world!

97
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,971
{Ding screaming}

98
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:32,144
{Knocking on door}

99
00:10:34,447 --> 00:10:35,847
- Who's there?

100
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:37,015
{Asian language}

101
00:10:48,194 --> 00:10:50,362
{Panting}

102

{Speaking Asian language}

103
00:10:59,338 --> 00:11:01,974
- Come! Governor Fung
will want to hear of this.

104
00:11:02,075 --> 00:11:03,976
{Both speaking
Asian language}

105
00:11:16,856 --> 00:11:18,957
{Man shouting
in Asian language}

106
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:21,093
{Horse carriage arriving}

107
00:11:31,905 --> 00:11:33,672
- Throw him with the others.

108
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,761
{Crying}

109
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,231
{Door opening}

110
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:01,766
- It's me they wanted!

111
00:12:01,835 --> 00:12:04,169
I should have done something.

112
00:12:04,237 --> 00:12:06,138
- There was nothing
you could do.

113
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:08,440
Now come.
We cannot stay here.

114
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:14,680
- Father! Where is Father?

115
00:12:14,747 --> 00:12:17,049
- They are going to pay
for this!

116
00:12:17,117 --> 00:12:20,185
They must have found
out about Elders!

117
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:25,457
We have to get his son
far away as possible!

118
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:29,361
- Lindsey is too well-connected.

119
00:12:29,428 --> 00:12:33,165
There is nowhere
the child can hide, not safely.

120
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:34,933
- Then what are we
to do with him?

121
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:37,168
- We'll take him
to Xidong Village.

122
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:39,270
Uncle Pei will know what to do.

123
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,247
{Rooster crowing}

124
00:12:50,116 --> 00:12:53,051
{Birds chirping}

125
00:13:42,702 --> 00:13:44,937
{Men speaking Asian language}

126
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:56,841
- Where am I?

127
00:14:56,976 --> 00:14:58,309
{Speaking Asian language}

128
00:15:12,024 --> 00:15:13,258
- {Mai}: Grey one?

129
00:15:13,325 --> 00:15:15,226
- Wort whistle.

130
00:15:15,295 --> 00:15:16,495
- Pink one?

131
00:15:16,562 --> 00:15:18,029
- Belladonna.

132
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:19,531
- Black one?

133
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:21,333
- Cloud Shade.
- Yay!

134
00:15:22,502 --> 00:15:26,738
{Both speaking Asian language}

135
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,657
Good, good, good.

136
00:15:45,692 --> 00:15:48,059
- If Chen wishes this,

137
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:50,262
then I will certainly do it.

138
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:53,999
- I think Chen completely wrong.

139
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:56,734
Let the foreigners
kill each other!

140
00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:59,003
It will save us the trouble.

141
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:03,841
- Tell him
that I will do as he wishes.

142
00:16:18,357 --> 00:16:22,027
You look like a cross between
a peacock and a swan.

143
00:16:23,762 --> 00:16:26,064
What am I to call you?

144
00:16:26,132 --> 00:16:28,266
- My name is Jonathan.

145
00:16:28,334 --> 00:16:31,302
Terrible things happened.

146
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:35,073
And I don't know
what happened to my father.

147
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:37,142
- Your father is dead.

148
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:42,514
I'm sorry.

149
00:16:42,582 --> 00:16:44,749
First, you mourn.

150
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:49,487
Then we'll see...

151
00:16:49,555 --> 00:16:52,623
what place
we can find for you...

152
00:16:52,691 --> 00:16:54,893
in this world.

153
00:16:57,597 --> 00:17:00,198
{Crow cawing}

154
00:17:25,157 --> 00:17:27,692
- That is your job, not mine.

155
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:29,961
- I too busy!
To fit in, you have to do a lot!

156
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:31,329
- No.

157
00:17:34,132 --> 00:17:35,900
- Did you say no?

158
00:17:40,105 --> 00:17:41,439
- Hey, cut it out!

159
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:43,408
- Yeah? Why should I?

160
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:49,147
{Grunting}

161
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:52,150
{Grunting}

162
00:18:02,861 --> 00:18:04,496
- Hmm!

163
00:18:05,464 --> 00:18:07,732
- You are a disgrace
to our village!

164
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,468
Go play with your foreign devil!

165
00:18:11,236 --> 00:18:13,738
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

166
00:18:13,806 --> 00:18:15,573
What was that?
It was incredible.

167
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:17,442
- It's called Wushu;

168
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:19,310
it's a martial art.

169
00:18:19,312 --> 00:18:22,146
- How do you know English?
- Uncle Pei teaches us.

170
00:18:22,214 --> 00:18:25,650
He says the way to know
how your enemy thinks

171
00:18:25,718 --> 00:18:27,919
is to learn the way they speak.

172
00:18:27,986 --> 00:18:30,121
- Why didn't anyone
tell me before?

173
00:18:30,189 --> 00:18:31,789
- You're still an outsider here.

174
00:18:31,857 --> 00:18:32,957
You don't fit in.

175
00:18:36,862 --> 00:18:40,298
{Instructor shouting
in Asian language}

176
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,558
{Continues shouting
in Asian language}

177
00:19:19,371 --> 00:19:24,075
- I don't think you are here
for an English lesson.

178
00:19:24,143 --> 00:19:26,210
- I want to learn Wushu.

179
00:19:26,278 --> 00:19:29,046
- You think...

180
00:19:30,015 --> 00:19:32,817
you can master the art of ages?

181
00:19:32,884 --> 00:19:36,487
- Yes. I'll give you
everything I have.

182
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:45,297
- We have never shared our
ways with a foreigner before.

183
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,968
But I will teach you.

184
00:19:52,337 --> 00:19:56,040
Within you, there is a dragon.

185
00:19:57,843 --> 00:19:59,110
Come.

186
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:00,878
Try and hit me.

187
00:20:02,514 --> 00:20:05,049
You must learn to do what I ask,

188
00:20:05,117 --> 00:20:06,417
without questions.

189
00:20:07,753 --> 00:20:08,420
{Grunting softly}

190
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,825
Try.

191
00:20:13,892 --> 00:20:15,726
Put something into it!

192
00:20:15,794 --> 00:20:17,228
{Yelling}

193
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:28,472
But there is one condition.

194
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,109
- Anything.

195
00:20:33,111 --> 00:20:35,747
- This must be our secret.

196
00:20:35,815 --> 00:20:38,216
Tell no one what we are doing.

197
00:21:14,486 --> 00:21:17,054
{Both grunting}

198
00:21:53,158 --> 00:21:55,893
{Grunting}

199
00:22:16,582 --> 00:22:18,816
You are doing well...

200
00:22:18,884 --> 00:22:20,852
for a foreigner.

201
00:22:30,763 --> 00:22:32,797
{Grunting}

202
00:22:32,865 --> 00:22:34,565
{Screaming}

203
00:22:38,037 --> 00:22:40,872
- Ah!
{Panting}

204
00:22:45,277 --> 00:22:47,311
I see Uncle Pei has been
teaching you some tricks.

205
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:49,080
- He knows many things
besides English.

206
00:22:49,147 --> 00:22:52,416
- I never thought
I would see this.

207
00:22:52,484 --> 00:22:53,718
It's nice.

208
00:22:57,422 --> 00:22:59,757
{Grunting}

209
00:23:00,826 --> 00:23:04,262
- Never assume you have
the upper hand, my darling.

210
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:05,997
- Yes, Pa.

211
00:23:10,168 --> 00:23:13,738
- Mistress, your plant-studies
instructor is waiting.

212
00:23:13,806 --> 00:23:15,940
- Off you go.

213
00:23:17,442 --> 00:23:19,343
- Of course, Papa.

214
00:23:22,014 --> 00:23:24,715
- You must empty yourself,

215
00:23:24,783 --> 00:23:27,852
become one with everything.

216
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,187
- I'm trying.

217
00:23:29,254 --> 00:23:32,123
- That's your trouble.

218
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:36,628
You must let the dragon be you.

219
00:23:36,695 --> 00:23:39,230
Wushu is a meditation.

220
00:23:39,297 --> 00:23:43,667
It's not made
for hate or revenge.

221
00:23:43,735 --> 00:23:46,870
- They killed
my father and Ding.

222
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:54,411
- You must let it go.

223
00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:57,782
The past is the past.

224
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,817
Seek inside,

225
00:23:59,885 --> 00:24:04,722
and never let your feelings
rule your actions, ever!

226
00:24:12,397 --> 00:24:14,265
- Our little lost English boy

227
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,533
has become a strong young man.

228
00:24:16,601 --> 00:24:20,204
- But he's half of what
he was meant to be.

229
00:24:21,873 --> 00:24:23,741
- Wushu is for the Chinese.

230
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:26,511
It can never be
understood by outsiders.

231
00:24:26,578 --> 00:24:28,078
- Leave us, young friend.

232
00:24:28,146 --> 00:24:30,848
We have business to discuss.

233
00:24:35,687 --> 00:24:39,056
The Hong merchants
are gathering.

234
00:24:39,124 --> 00:24:42,293
The shipment must have arrived.

235
00:24:42,361 --> 00:24:44,528
- The roads are all watched.
How could it happen?

236
00:24:44,596 --> 00:24:46,931
- The English know many tactics.

237
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,968
They surely know just
what strings to pull on.

238
00:24:52,804 --> 00:24:54,238
- We have to find out

239
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:56,040
where they are
taking the opium.

240
00:24:56,108 --> 00:24:57,942
- I can get
the information for you.

241
00:25:00,011 --> 00:25:03,280
For once,
being a foreigner is good.

242
00:25:03,349 --> 00:25:05,850
I can move through the
British concession unnoticed.

243
00:25:09,154 --> 00:25:11,322
This is my fight, too.

244
00:25:16,428 --> 00:25:18,496
- Perhaps it is time.

245
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,928
{Speaking Asian language}

246
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:01,339
- I am honoured you have
interest in my store.

247
00:26:01,407 --> 00:26:04,676
- These are the things I need.

248
00:26:39,344 --> 00:26:42,447
- These creatures
only love their weakness.

249
00:26:42,514 --> 00:26:44,215
- Where do they go?

250
00:26:47,185 --> 00:26:49,587
What do they see?

251
00:26:49,655 --> 00:26:51,622
- They drift

252
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,190
where their thoughts lead them.

253
00:26:53,258 --> 00:26:56,494
But their dreams are empty.

254
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,899
You must always be strong.

255
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:06,203
There is no place in your
life for such empty dreams.

256
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,558
{Speaking Asian language}

257
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:32,596
{Shouting}

258
00:27:32,664 --> 00:27:35,333
{Grunting}

259
00:27:46,144 --> 00:27:49,080
{Man groaning}

260
00:28:12,037 --> 00:28:14,105
- Witchcraft and sorcery
are fine,

261
00:28:14,173 --> 00:28:16,174
but they have
their limitations.

262
00:28:16,241 --> 00:28:18,276
- There is more to it than that.

263
00:28:18,343 --> 00:28:20,745
The only limitations
are knowledge

264
00:28:20,812 --> 00:28:22,613
and one's willingness to use it.

265
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,882
- Your knowledge
wasn't very useful in there.

266
00:28:37,128 --> 00:28:39,096
{Dog barking}

267
00:28:41,032 --> 00:28:43,601
- As you know, each of
you has been handpicked

268
00:28:43,668 --> 00:28:46,203
and given provinces to control

269
00:28:46,271 --> 00:28:48,639
by my good friend the Governor.

270
00:28:48,707 --> 00:28:51,042
We've given you
an endless supply of opium

271
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:53,811
and addicts to consume it.

272
00:28:53,879 --> 00:28:57,547
We've given you the right
to enslave your people

273
00:28:57,615 --> 00:29:00,418
and send them to work on
plantations around the empire.

274
00:29:00,486 --> 00:29:05,656
You, the Hong merchants,

275
00:29:05,723 --> 00:29:08,558
have been well rewarded
for your efforts.

276
00:29:08,626 --> 00:29:11,929
- Our gratitude is yours,
and our special thanks.

277
00:29:15,467 --> 00:29:17,000
- We need more,

278
00:29:17,068 --> 00:29:19,703
50,000 more slaves,

279
00:29:19,771 --> 00:29:22,873
for our western
estates and plantations.

280
00:29:22,941 --> 00:29:25,042
- That can't be done!
- Which is why

281
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,443
we are increasing your quota

282
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:28,379
of opium distribution.

283
00:29:35,354 --> 00:29:36,687
- Hey! You!

284
00:29:36,755 --> 00:29:38,422
- What are you doing?
- Jonathan!

285
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:41,025
Jonathan!

286
00:29:49,701 --> 00:29:51,168
{Horse neighing}

287
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,939
{Grunting}
Cha! Cha!

288
00:29:55,006 --> 00:29:55,906
{Grunting}

289
00:29:55,974 --> 00:29:57,841
Jonathan! Hurry up!
Cha! Cha!

290
00:29:57,909 --> 00:30:00,444
Cha! Cha!
We gotta go!

291
00:30:00,512 --> 00:30:02,180
- This is for my father!

292
00:30:02,247 --> 00:30:04,182
{Shouting}

293
00:30:12,157 --> 00:30:15,426
- Cha! Cha!
Cha! Cha!

294
00:30:15,494 --> 00:30:16,894
Jonathan, let's go!

295
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:18,695
- Jonathan.

296
00:30:18,763 --> 00:30:19,397
- Jonathan!

297
00:30:23,435 --> 00:30:24,534
- Hey!

298
00:30:24,602 --> 00:30:27,871
- Cha! Cha!
Cha! Cha!

299
00:30:27,939 --> 00:30:29,040
- Look out!

300
00:30:29,107 --> 00:30:32,009
- After them!
Move, you fools!

301
00:30:32,076 --> 00:30:34,177
{Screaming}

302
00:30:37,949 --> 00:30:39,083
- Hey!

303
00:30:41,953 --> 00:30:43,587
Stop!

304
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,094
Hey!

305
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:56,400
- Cha! Cha!

306
00:31:00,138 --> 00:31:00,971
- Ah!
- I had him!

307
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,306
He was right there!

308
00:31:02,374 --> 00:31:04,241
- Don't worry!
There'll be another chance.

309
00:31:04,309 --> 00:31:05,676
- Idiots!

310
00:31:05,744 --> 00:31:07,378
{Screaming}

311
00:31:09,548 --> 00:31:10,915
- Who the hell is she?

312
00:31:10,982 --> 00:31:12,883
- It's Lindsey's daughter!
- What do we do with her?

313
00:31:12,951 --> 00:31:14,251
- Throw her
in the devil's water!

314
00:31:14,318 --> 00:31:16,487
{Screaming}

315
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:19,290
- Close it!

316
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:23,126
- I want every soldier
in Shanghai looking for her.

317
00:31:23,194 --> 00:31:26,363
- Immediately, sir.

318
00:31:26,431 --> 00:31:27,732
- I also want a reward posted

319
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:29,567
for information leading
to her release.

320
00:31:32,304 --> 00:31:33,971
God gave you legs
to carry out my wishes.

321
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:36,340
If they don't move
in the next 5 seconds...

322
00:31:36,408 --> 00:31:41,645
I'll have them cut off.

323
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,197
- We're here, miss.

324
00:32:02,467 --> 00:32:04,702
It would be good
if you got off now.

325
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:09,273
Otherwise,
I'll have to carry you.

326
00:32:23,187 --> 00:32:26,223
- I see Jonathan knows
how to handle a woman.

327
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:37,334
- What's this?

328
00:32:37,402 --> 00:32:39,837
- We had to borrow
a carriage to get away.

329
00:32:39,904 --> 00:32:42,072
She was in it.
- It's Lindsey's daughter.

330
00:32:42,139 --> 00:32:44,275
- We didn't know
what to do with her.

331
00:32:46,044 --> 00:32:48,712
- Pei-Shu, we could use her

332
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,881
as a bargaining chip.

333
00:32:55,587 --> 00:32:58,054
- We are not kidnappers.
I don't like this.

334
00:32:58,122 --> 00:33:01,325
We'll keep her until morning

335
00:33:01,393 --> 00:33:02,759
and decide then.

336
00:33:06,498 --> 00:33:09,867
{Men speaking Asian language}

337
00:33:11,803 --> 00:33:14,405
{Baby crying}

338
00:33:29,921 --> 00:33:32,623
{Crickets chirping}

339
00:33:48,206 --> 00:33:50,107
{Chen}: It's a list of villages.

340
00:33:52,243 --> 00:33:57,014
It tells all the merchants
how many people to enslave.

341
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:04,088
They drug our people and
send them to forced labour.

342
00:34:04,155 --> 00:34:06,890
{Wang}: Is there
no end to their evil?

343
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:09,426
{Pei}:
We have to warn the villages.

344
00:34:09,494 --> 00:34:10,894
{Wang}: I'll go.

345
00:34:10,962 --> 00:34:12,896
{Chen}: See to it.

346
00:34:16,868 --> 00:34:18,902
You did well today.

347
00:34:25,944 --> 00:34:28,946
{Blowing whistle}

348
00:34:32,717 --> 00:34:34,452
- Goodnight.

349
00:34:40,492 --> 00:34:42,193
- You all right?

350
00:34:43,528 --> 00:34:46,096
- I saw the man
who had my father killed.

351
00:34:47,132 --> 00:34:49,099
- How did you feel?

352
00:34:51,702 --> 00:34:55,238
- I didn't know you could
hate another person so much.

353
00:34:55,306 --> 00:34:58,308
- You have to let go.

354
00:34:59,443 --> 00:35:01,611
- I can't.

355
00:35:03,014 --> 00:35:04,915
I don't know how.

356
00:35:17,028 --> 00:35:18,829
- The news?

357
00:35:18,897 --> 00:35:20,398
- Nothing, sir.

358
00:35:34,045 --> 00:35:36,146
- I thought you might be hungry.

359
00:35:36,214 --> 00:35:38,815
So...

360
00:35:38,883 --> 00:35:40,684
here's breakfast.

361
00:35:40,752 --> 00:35:42,486
- Thank you.

362
00:35:42,554 --> 00:35:45,422
- Might not be
what you're used to,

363
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:48,125
but it's good.

364
00:35:48,193 --> 00:35:51,361
- Do you care to join me?

365
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:55,198
- I shouldn't.
I have things to do.

366
00:35:59,905 --> 00:36:01,906
- Like kidnapping
other young English girls?

367
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,543
- We didn't hurt you.

368
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:09,380
We didn't know you were there
or you were Lindsey's daughter.

369
00:36:11,483 --> 00:36:13,751
- What do you know
of my father?

370
00:36:13,818 --> 00:36:16,186
He's a wonderful man.

371
00:36:16,254 --> 00:36:18,589
He's done everything for me.

372
00:36:18,656 --> 00:36:19,990
And he's been a good friend

373
00:36:20,058 --> 00:36:21,892
to the Chinese people.

374
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,762
- You mean the Manchu Governor
and the Hong merchants.

375
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:27,497
- In the city,
all of the Chinese respect him.

376
00:36:27,565 --> 00:36:30,667
- He has brought nothing
but pain and hardship

377
00:36:30,735 --> 00:36:31,835
to my people.

378
00:36:31,902 --> 00:36:33,970
- Where did you get
that "your people" stuff?

379
00:36:34,038 --> 00:36:35,906
You're not Chinese.

380
00:36:37,742 --> 00:36:39,910
{Sighing}

381
00:36:39,978 --> 00:36:42,345
Jonathan...

382
00:36:44,516 --> 00:36:47,117
I know who you really are.

383
00:36:52,524 --> 00:36:57,261
{Men shouting
in Asian language}

384
00:37:30,328 --> 00:37:33,129
- Well?
- Notices are everywhere, sir,

385
00:37:33,197 --> 00:37:34,698
and we're searching
homes for anyone

386
00:37:34,765 --> 00:37:36,800
that might have been involved
in yesterday's events.

387
00:37:36,868 --> 00:37:39,502
- And they know not to be gentle
in their questioning.

388
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,004
- That they do, sir.

389
00:38:05,796 --> 00:38:07,063
- I've come to offer my help.

390
00:38:07,131 --> 00:38:10,867
- Those bloody swine!

391
00:38:13,104 --> 00:38:14,438
- They are like the fog.

392
00:38:16,207 --> 00:38:17,808
They come in stealth...

393
00:38:19,076 --> 00:38:20,243
and disappear.

394
00:38:20,311 --> 00:38:25,015
But this time,
someone will talk.

395
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:28,385
I propose
to double your reward.

396
00:38:29,921 --> 00:38:31,755
- Your generosity moves me.

397
00:38:50,342 --> 00:38:52,175
{Horse neighing}

398
00:39:20,371 --> 00:39:22,172
- Hey, hey!

399
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,184
What's troubling you?

400
00:39:34,252 --> 00:39:36,453
- The girl we brought here.

401
00:39:36,521 --> 00:39:37,521
- Yes.

402
00:39:38,923 --> 00:39:41,692
- She knew my name.

403
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:45,028
- Perhaps she heard
Tian say it on the boat.

404
00:39:45,096 --> 00:39:48,498
- She says she knows
who I really am.

405
00:39:48,566 --> 00:39:50,967
- So do I.

406
00:39:51,035 --> 00:39:52,869
You're Jonathan
of Xidong Village,

407
00:39:52,937 --> 00:39:56,205
an orphan we took in...

408
00:39:56,273 --> 00:39:58,041
as one of our own.

409
00:40:00,478 --> 00:40:03,680
- She meant who I was
before I came here.

410
00:40:03,747 --> 00:40:07,217
- Life is about who you are,

411
00:40:07,285 --> 00:40:09,353
not who you were.

412
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,787
- I want to kill her father,

413
00:40:10,855 --> 00:40:12,890
but she seems so...

414
00:40:12,957 --> 00:40:15,692
nice, helpless.

415
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,527
I don't know.

416
00:40:17,595 --> 00:40:21,365
- Don't think about it too much.

417
00:40:21,432 --> 00:40:23,600
Life is simple.

418
00:40:27,638 --> 00:40:29,639
- I hope you enjoyed the show.

419
00:40:29,707 --> 00:40:32,609
- It--it wasn't me;
I didn't see anything.

420
00:40:37,448 --> 00:40:39,215
- So you mean I'm nothing?

421
00:40:39,283 --> 00:40:43,419
- No. You're really something.

422
00:40:43,487 --> 00:40:45,489
- So...

423
00:40:45,556 --> 00:40:48,124
you were watching.

424
00:40:50,829 --> 00:40:52,662
- No. I mean...

425
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,264
not...

426
00:41:10,081 --> 00:41:12,216
{Grunting}

427
00:42:14,478 --> 00:42:18,649
- Queen of Skies,
Mistress of Night,

428
00:42:18,716 --> 00:42:21,785
grant me power
to escape this place.

429
00:42:21,853 --> 00:42:26,723
Make truth from lies,
and pity my plight.

430
00:42:26,791 --> 00:42:30,126
Let Jonathan
believe my face.

431
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:49,879
- I can tell;

432
00:42:49,947 --> 00:42:52,215
you are your father's seed.

433
00:42:52,283 --> 00:42:56,519
The shoot bends
as the branch before.

434
00:42:58,756 --> 00:43:02,692
- I have no idea
what you're talking about.

435
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,527
- Here, there has
always been shelter

436
00:43:04,595 --> 00:43:06,296
for those in need.

437
00:43:08,132 --> 00:43:11,300
You will never know
what true peace is.

438
00:43:11,368 --> 00:43:14,637
- I know what will happen
when my father finds you.

439
00:43:22,479 --> 00:43:25,015
- I know. I know.
It--it's my fault.

440
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:27,216
- Oh, I wouldn't be
so hard on myself, sir.

441
00:43:27,284 --> 00:43:32,121
- No, no.
I accept full responsibility.

442
00:43:32,156 --> 00:43:33,823
{Chuckles}

443
00:43:33,891 --> 00:43:37,827
You know,
they say this is priceless.

444
00:43:48,172 --> 00:43:51,340
My daughter...

445
00:43:51,408 --> 00:43:53,409
is priceless.

446
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,915
And who do I put
in charge of finding her?

447
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:01,718
A raving...

448
00:44:03,621 --> 00:44:04,854
drivelling...

449
00:44:04,923 --> 00:44:09,159
second-rate incompetent!

450
00:44:36,987 --> 00:44:38,922
{Knocking on door}

451
00:44:56,207 --> 00:44:57,874
- Won't you join me?

452
00:45:13,257 --> 00:45:15,092
Give me your hand.

453
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,494
Give me your hand.

454
00:45:26,904 --> 00:45:28,438
See?

455
00:45:28,505 --> 00:45:30,506
We're alike.

456
00:45:30,942 --> 00:45:34,377
We're both English, not Chinese.

457
00:45:36,814 --> 00:45:39,049
We were born in the West.

458
00:45:41,418 --> 00:45:43,019
- I was born here.

459
00:45:43,087 --> 00:45:45,621
My mother died having me.

460
00:45:47,158 --> 00:45:48,992
Your father
had my father killed.

461
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:50,493
- Who told you that?

462
00:45:50,561 --> 00:45:53,463
- Chen. He was the one
who saved me.

463
00:45:53,531 --> 00:45:56,832
- He's obviously the one
who killed your father.

464
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,968
- That's not true.

465
00:45:59,036 --> 00:46:02,772
- They've obviously filled
your head with stories.

466
00:46:07,744 --> 00:46:10,347
And now they're going
to kill me as well.

467
00:46:10,415 --> 00:46:12,049
- That's rubbish.

468
00:46:12,116 --> 00:46:14,651
No one is going to hurt you.

469
00:46:14,718 --> 00:46:17,953
- Do you think
they can let me go now?

470
00:46:18,021 --> 00:46:19,489
Now that I know where you are?

471
00:46:22,826 --> 00:46:24,361
Jonathan...

472
00:46:25,762 --> 00:46:28,365
- What you're saying
is all lies.

473
00:46:28,432 --> 00:46:30,600
- But what if it isn't?

474
00:46:30,667 --> 00:46:34,304
Jonathan, I'm so frightened.

475
00:46:35,706 --> 00:46:37,840
Please hold me.

476
00:46:52,456 --> 00:46:54,724
- Chen wants to see you.

477
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,581
{Chen, echoing}:
Are you all right, Jonathan?

478
00:47:21,051 --> 00:47:22,585
{Jonathan, echoing}:
What are you staring at?

479
00:47:22,653 --> 00:47:24,154
{Xi Guay, echoing}:
A complete fool.

480
00:47:24,221 --> 00:47:27,857
- Look at me.
I'm not from here.

481
00:47:27,925 --> 00:47:30,460
All these years,
and I still don't belong!

482
00:47:30,527 --> 00:47:32,262
- Lindsey is torturing
innocent people

483
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:35,665
to find his daughter.
- What did you expect?

484
00:47:35,733 --> 00:47:37,934
We started this.

485
00:47:38,002 --> 00:47:41,271
{Xi Guay}: Even a beautiful
snake can be treacherous.

486
00:47:41,339 --> 00:47:44,207
- Then what did you want?

487
00:47:47,077 --> 00:47:50,113
{Wang, echoing}: I still say
we should get rid of her.

488
00:47:54,952 --> 00:47:57,586
- Put these on.

489
00:47:57,654 --> 00:47:59,856
{Wang}: It's the only way
to stop them.

490
00:47:59,924 --> 00:48:01,224
{Chen}: No.

491
00:48:01,292 --> 00:48:02,992
- Um... Help me.

492
00:48:09,166 --> 00:48:11,635
Come with me.

493
00:48:11,702 --> 00:48:14,737
{Wang}: Let me take care of it.
I will do it.

494
00:48:16,474 --> 00:48:18,141
- Thank you.

495
00:48:21,712 --> 00:48:24,147
We were meant for each other.

496
00:48:42,732 --> 00:48:45,168
- Not so far away...

497
00:48:45,235 --> 00:48:47,971
yet not near.

498
00:48:48,038 --> 00:48:50,773
In a village by the water...

499
00:48:50,841 --> 00:48:56,479
there is an old man
and a younger man

500
00:48:56,546 --> 00:48:59,215
who are blocking the way.

501
00:49:01,018 --> 00:49:03,953
- I was afraid
this would occur.

502
00:49:04,021 --> 00:49:06,189
- Wang wants her dead.
I heard him.

503
00:49:06,224 --> 00:49:08,324
- Wang is hot-headed
and full of anger.

504
00:49:08,392 --> 00:49:12,028
Chen and I would
never allow it.

505
00:49:12,095 --> 00:49:13,697
{Lindsey}:
What else do you see?

506
00:49:13,798 --> 00:49:16,533
{Speaking Asian language}

507
00:49:21,372 --> 00:49:22,772
- The young one...

508
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:28,378
he has the power of the dragon.

509
00:49:28,446 --> 00:49:31,548
He seeks...

510
00:49:31,615 --> 00:49:33,883
but cannot find.

511
00:49:35,987 --> 00:49:38,821
If this one find
the fire of the dragon,

512
00:49:38,889 --> 00:49:40,790
we are all of us in danger.

513
00:49:40,858 --> 00:49:42,892
- You are going nowhere.

514
00:49:45,663 --> 00:49:47,196
{Groaning}

515
00:49:47,264 --> 00:49:48,564
- Hyah! Hyah!

516
00:49:52,236 --> 00:49:56,206
- I have a score to settle
with your dragon.

517
00:49:56,273 --> 00:49:58,474
- Help!

518
00:49:58,542 --> 00:49:59,542
Someone!

519
00:49:59,609 --> 00:50:01,411
- When I find him...

520
00:50:01,479 --> 00:50:05,648
I'll send him
to the eighth level of hell.

521
00:51:00,638 --> 00:51:03,439
{Rooster crowing}

522
00:51:06,443 --> 00:51:08,678
- How is he?

523
00:51:11,581 --> 00:51:13,016
- He's been poisoned,

524
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:16,385
with Moon Shade
and Spider's Claw.

525
00:51:17,921 --> 00:51:20,156
- Is there something I can do?

526
00:51:20,224 --> 00:51:23,826
- The only way to fight
poison is with poison.

527
00:51:23,894 --> 00:51:26,896
What we need
is the Song of Midnight.

528
00:51:26,963 --> 00:51:28,598
- Where can I find it?

529
00:51:28,666 --> 00:51:32,134
- It's a silver flower that
grows among blue leaves.

530
00:51:32,202 --> 00:51:33,836
The only place I've seen it

531
00:51:33,903 --> 00:51:35,938
is in Governor Fung's garden.

532
00:51:36,006 --> 00:51:38,341
- I'll go at once.

533
00:51:38,409 --> 00:51:40,009
- No, you can't!

534
00:51:40,076 --> 00:51:41,478
- I have to.

535
00:51:46,683 --> 00:51:48,217
I've been such a fool.

536
00:51:48,284 --> 00:51:51,521
If anything happens
to Uncle Pei...

537
00:51:51,588 --> 00:51:55,558
I've made it wrong.
Now I'll make it right.

538
00:52:09,707 --> 00:52:13,075
- I am happy
you are safe and sound.

539
00:52:18,516 --> 00:52:20,983
- Are you certain
you're all right, my darling?

540
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:22,652
- I'm fine, Daddy.

541
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:25,221
They're imbeciles, really.

542
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:27,490
Especially that Jonathan.

543
00:52:27,558 --> 00:52:29,925
I can't believe
you let him get away.

544
00:52:29,993 --> 00:52:31,961
{Chuckles}

545
00:52:32,029 --> 00:52:34,130
- Don't fret.

546
00:52:34,198 --> 00:52:36,565
He'll pay.

547
00:52:36,633 --> 00:52:37,633
They'll all pay.

548
00:52:37,701 --> 00:52:40,436
- Mmm...

549
00:52:43,273 --> 00:52:44,773
{Speaking Asian language}

550
00:53:02,092 --> 00:53:04,293
{Dog barking in distance}

551
00:53:06,296 --> 00:53:08,130
{Dog barking}

552
00:53:52,709 --> 00:53:55,578
{Guards speaking
Asian language}

553
00:53:55,646 --> 00:53:57,012
{Dog barking}

554
00:53:58,415 --> 00:53:59,916
- Hiyah!

555
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:05,388
{Grunting}

556
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:23,506
{All screaming}

557
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,322
- You shouldn't
have come for me.

558
00:54:39,389 --> 00:54:41,223
- Quick. We better move.

559
00:54:41,292 --> 00:54:43,993
They'll send more men soon.

560
00:54:49,366 --> 00:54:52,134
- You idiots! Do you have any
idea of risk you were taking?

561
00:54:52,202 --> 00:54:53,202
- Uncle Pei?

562
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:57,473
- He is still among us,
only barely.

563
00:54:57,541 --> 00:54:58,807
- Go!

564
00:55:31,108 --> 00:55:32,374
{Coughing}

565
00:55:58,434 --> 00:56:00,435
- Jonathan...

566
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,073
{Groaning}

567
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,175
You have the world's...

568
00:56:07,177 --> 00:56:09,344
biggest heart.

569
00:56:11,982 --> 00:56:13,048
But there's...

570
00:56:13,116 --> 00:56:16,319
work to be done...

571
00:56:16,386 --> 00:56:20,856
on what goes on...

572
00:56:20,924 --> 00:56:24,560
in this head of yours.

573
00:56:27,196 --> 00:56:29,498
{Coughing}

574
00:56:36,272 --> 00:56:38,574
- I made your favourite.

575
00:56:41,478 --> 00:56:43,312
Mushroom with eggplant.

576
00:56:43,379 --> 00:56:45,815
- You shouldn't have.

577
00:56:45,882 --> 00:56:48,918
- I know that. I wanted to.

578
00:56:58,861 --> 00:57:00,696
- Nothing will ever
be the same again.

579
00:57:00,763 --> 00:57:02,798
We'll have to leave

580
00:57:02,865 --> 00:57:05,334
the only place I've
ever known as home.

581
00:57:05,402 --> 00:57:08,603
Has Chen decided
where we're going?

582
00:57:08,671 --> 00:57:11,541
- He picked out
a safe place downriver.

583
00:57:11,608 --> 00:57:13,476
We'll leave in groups
after dark

584
00:57:13,544 --> 00:57:15,878
and meet at the temple ruins.

585
00:57:24,721 --> 00:57:26,389
- Can I come, too, Papa?

586
00:57:26,456 --> 00:57:27,923
- No, my darling.

587
00:57:27,991 --> 00:57:29,691
You've had enough
adventures for a while.

588
00:57:29,759 --> 00:57:31,560
- But I want to see you
punish those men

589
00:57:31,627 --> 00:57:34,029
who were so mean to me.

590
00:57:34,097 --> 00:57:35,331
Please?

591
00:57:37,267 --> 00:57:38,467
- All right.

592
00:58:36,526 --> 00:58:39,361
- That's the wretched little
pigsty they kept me in.

593
00:58:45,802 --> 00:58:48,704
- Come.
They can't have gone far.

594
00:58:58,815 --> 00:59:00,983
- Isn't Father wonderful?

595
00:59:01,051 --> 00:59:03,919
- Yes, His Lordship
is most impressive.

596
00:59:03,987 --> 00:59:05,988
I've decided to do him
a great honour.

597
00:59:06,056 --> 00:59:08,824
I've decided to marry you.

598
00:59:12,429 --> 00:59:16,065
It will cement our alliance.

599
00:59:16,133 --> 00:59:17,833
{Laughing}

600
00:59:19,936 --> 00:59:21,971
- What an amazing idea!

601
00:59:22,038 --> 00:59:23,906
{Speaking Asian language}

602
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,328
{Chen}: Where's Jonathan?

603
00:59:46,396 --> 00:59:48,330
- Wang, have you seen him?

604
00:59:48,398 --> 00:59:50,833
- He stay behind.

605
00:59:58,275 --> 00:59:59,475
- Ah!

606
01:00:06,583 --> 01:00:08,484
My young friend,

607
01:00:08,551 --> 01:00:12,387
have you learned nothing
from our time together?

608
01:00:12,455 --> 01:00:16,225
Vengeance is not
the path of the dragon.

609
01:00:17,661 --> 01:00:20,529
There is a fire in you,
Jonathan,

610
01:00:20,596 --> 01:00:22,364
but it's fed by a darkness.

611
01:00:29,772 --> 01:00:31,807
When the stars are right,

612
01:00:31,874 --> 01:00:35,243
the dragon's heart
will show you the way.

613
01:00:35,312 --> 01:00:37,680
Let's go!

614
01:00:37,747 --> 01:00:38,580
No!

615
01:00:49,892 --> 01:00:51,027
- NO!

616
01:00:52,195 --> 01:00:54,730
NO!

617
01:00:57,567 --> 01:01:02,137
- I think it's high time
you learned some manners.

618
01:01:02,205 --> 01:01:03,405
{Grunting}

619
01:01:13,116 --> 01:01:14,950
- Ah!
{Grunting}

620
01:01:24,161 --> 01:01:28,797
- After him!
Go! Shoot the boy!

621
01:01:28,865 --> 01:01:30,599
{Gunshots}

622
01:01:30,667 --> 01:01:32,334
- Chen!

623
01:01:32,402 --> 01:01:34,470
- Let's go!

624
01:01:42,411 --> 01:01:43,612
{Sighing}

625
01:01:48,284 --> 01:01:49,818
{Lindsey}:
Your arrival was very timely.

626
01:01:49,886 --> 01:01:53,389
{Guard shouting
in Asian language}

627
01:01:53,523 --> 01:01:54,690
- Daddy.

628
01:01:54,757 --> 01:01:56,993
Daddy, the most dreadful
thing just happened.

629
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:58,794
- Don't fret, my darling.

630
01:01:58,862 --> 01:02:01,330
Young Jonathan's
used up all his luck.

631
01:02:01,398 --> 01:02:05,134
- No, it's not that.
Fung wants to marry me!

632
01:02:06,169 --> 01:02:07,903
- The audacity.

633
01:02:09,639 --> 01:02:10,806
On the other hand,

634
01:02:10,874 --> 01:02:15,911
if he were to, um,
expire during his sleep,

635
01:02:15,945 --> 01:02:18,580
no one would
question the cause.

636
01:02:18,648 --> 01:02:20,682
- Perhaps even
on our wedding night.

637
01:02:24,053 --> 01:02:25,287
{Speaking Asian language}

638
01:02:25,355 --> 01:02:28,056
- We've captured
the head of the dragon!

639
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,887
- What did you learn?

640
01:04:05,955 --> 01:04:08,990
- Lindsey's daughter
is to marry Governor Fung.

641
01:04:10,993 --> 01:04:12,428
{Laughing}

642
01:04:15,665 --> 01:04:18,166
- This could work for us.

643
01:04:18,235 --> 01:04:20,402
With everyone at the
Governor's residence,

644
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:23,939
we could search Lindsey's
home for some clues.

645
01:04:24,006 --> 01:04:25,674
- What about Chen?

646
01:04:25,742 --> 01:04:28,110
- Chen will be there.

647
01:04:28,177 --> 01:04:30,479
He is to be executed
during the wedding feast.

648
01:04:30,547 --> 01:04:32,681
{Wang}: What?

649
01:04:32,749 --> 01:04:34,150
- When?

650
01:04:34,217 --> 01:04:35,984
- Two days' time.

651
01:04:36,052 --> 01:04:37,586
- Where?

652
01:04:37,653 --> 01:04:39,421
- At the Fungs' mansion.

653
01:04:39,489 --> 01:04:41,623
- That's not a lot of time.

654
01:04:41,691 --> 01:04:43,392
- But it will have to do.

655
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:46,061
It's all we have.

656
01:04:53,937 --> 01:04:57,138
{Thunder rumbling}

657
01:05:06,182 --> 01:05:07,983
{Thunder rumbling}

658
01:05:23,966 --> 01:05:25,868
{Grunting}

659
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:42,184
Come on!

660
01:06:22,458 --> 01:06:26,061
{Men speaking Asian language}

661
01:06:44,614 --> 01:06:48,683
- And how is the widow-to-be?

662
01:06:48,751 --> 01:06:50,319
- I feel ridiculous.

663
01:06:50,387 --> 01:06:52,488
But I'd feel even more foolish

664
01:06:52,555 --> 01:06:54,790
if I didn't take
that monstrosity

665
01:06:54,857 --> 01:06:56,525
for everything he's worth.

666
01:06:56,593 --> 01:07:00,662
- I can't tell you
how proud I am.

667
01:07:13,976 --> 01:07:16,978
{Drums beating}

668
01:07:42,672 --> 01:07:46,208
{Crowd applauding}

669
01:08:04,994 --> 01:08:07,028
{Crowd applauding}

670
01:09:30,913 --> 01:09:32,547
Ladies and gentlemen,

671
01:09:32,615 --> 01:09:35,617
please permit me,
as father of the bride,

672
01:09:35,684 --> 01:09:38,987
to make a toast.

673
01:09:39,055 --> 01:09:43,091
I can think of no one
I would prefer as son-in-law

674
01:09:43,159 --> 01:09:45,794
than the honourable
Governor Fung.

675
01:09:45,862 --> 01:09:47,596
May you both find...

676
01:09:47,664 --> 01:09:50,098
eternal happiness.

677
01:09:55,004 --> 01:09:57,606
{Crowd chattering}

678
01:09:59,175 --> 01:10:01,342
To make this day
truly memorable,

679
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:03,378
I offer as a wedding gift,

680
01:10:03,446 --> 01:10:07,248
and for your
general entertainment...

681
01:10:08,051 --> 01:10:09,818
the leader of the scourge

682
01:10:09,886 --> 01:10:11,820
that has terrorized
our community!

683
01:10:14,857 --> 01:10:16,057
{All chattering excitedly}

684
01:10:16,125 --> 01:10:18,460
Tonight,
Manchu and English justice

685
01:10:18,527 --> 01:10:21,396
will swing as one,
bringing to an end...

686
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:25,667
this worthless life.

687
01:10:28,337 --> 01:10:31,339
- But first,
for your pleasure...

688
01:10:32,608 --> 01:10:35,910
may I present
the finest performer

689
01:10:35,978 --> 01:10:37,645
of the Szechuan Opera,

690
01:10:37,713 --> 01:10:39,948
the Master of Masks!

691
01:10:41,484 --> 01:10:43,918
{All applauding}

692
01:10:50,326 --> 01:10:56,197
{Traditional Chinese
music playing}

693
01:10:56,265 --> 01:10:58,500
{Crowd cheering}

694
01:11:38,207 --> 01:11:39,407
{Lindsey}: Bravo!

695
01:11:39,475 --> 01:11:42,477
- You! Come here!

696
01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:55,890
You're quite astonishing,
you know.

697
01:11:55,958 --> 01:11:57,725
And I'm not often impressed.

698
01:11:59,962 --> 01:12:02,230
Show me your true face.

699
01:12:05,434 --> 01:12:07,969
I said show me your face,

700
01:12:08,036 --> 01:12:09,604
little dancer.

701
01:12:10,439 --> 01:12:11,506
{Fung grunting}

702
01:12:13,576 --> 01:12:15,943
- You heard her.

703
01:12:16,011 --> 01:12:17,445
Our patience runs out.

704
01:12:22,552 --> 01:12:24,352
{Crowd chattering excitedly}

705
01:12:40,035 --> 01:12:42,704
- Predictable to the end.

706
01:12:44,507 --> 01:12:47,275
Just like your father.

707
01:12:52,414 --> 01:12:54,715
{Crowd screaming}

708
01:13:05,594 --> 01:13:07,261
- Ah!

709
01:13:16,338 --> 01:13:18,606
- Ah!

710
01:14:00,049 --> 01:14:01,415
- Jonathan!

711
01:14:05,087 --> 01:14:06,254
{Xi Guay screaming}

712
01:14:13,663 --> 01:14:16,031
- Let me show you

713
01:14:16,098 --> 01:14:20,568
the proper way
to handle a woman.

714
01:14:33,115 --> 01:14:35,984
{Grunting}

715
01:14:58,273 --> 01:14:59,340
- Daddy!

716
01:15:02,978 --> 01:15:03,845
Daddy...

717
01:15:04,213 --> 01:15:05,914
Daddy, are you all right?

718
01:15:05,981 --> 01:15:07,748
Are you all right?
Daddy?

719
01:15:07,816 --> 01:15:09,083
- Hey!

720
01:15:09,151 --> 01:15:12,187
It was I who killed your father!
I'm the one you want!

721
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:14,055
- You're nothing but a pawn.

722
01:15:14,122 --> 01:15:15,990
But you'll kill
no more of my people.

723
01:15:18,026 --> 01:15:19,795
{Screaming}

724
01:15:37,112 --> 01:15:39,814
- Come on.

725
01:15:49,491 --> 01:15:51,392
{Groaning}

726
01:15:57,933 --> 01:16:00,201
- No!

727
01:16:58,127 --> 01:17:01,129
- Lord Lindsey,
with great respect,

728
01:17:01,196 --> 01:17:03,564
I've come to claim my wife,

729
01:17:03,632 --> 01:17:05,033
my property.

730
01:17:08,336 --> 01:17:10,604
- Business, yes.

731
01:17:13,709 --> 01:17:15,509
Business.

732
01:17:17,947 --> 01:17:19,547
- Please, Daddy.

733
01:17:19,615 --> 01:17:21,449
Please, Daddy,
don't make me.

734
01:17:21,517 --> 01:17:24,019
- It's going to be all right.
- Don't make me.

735
01:17:24,086 --> 01:17:26,354
- It's going to be all right.
- Please. Daddy.

736
01:17:45,574 --> 01:17:49,544
{Speaking Asian language}

737
01:17:54,349 --> 01:17:57,051
- So our little Wushu dragon

738
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:59,754
finally learned to breathe fire.

739
01:17:59,822 --> 01:18:02,924
- It's hard to believe I used
to push you into the river.

740
01:18:02,992 --> 01:18:05,459
{Both laughing}

741
01:18:05,527 --> 01:18:07,261
So...

742
01:18:07,329 --> 01:18:08,997
how did you do it?

743
01:18:09,064 --> 01:18:12,166
- I just, uh...

744
01:18:12,234 --> 01:18:14,736
I saw Lindsey with Xi Guay.

745
01:18:16,272 --> 01:18:18,072
- The question is,

746
01:18:18,273 --> 01:18:20,808
can you do it again?

747
01:18:22,944 --> 01:18:25,012
