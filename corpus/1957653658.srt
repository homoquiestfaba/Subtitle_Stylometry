Whoa. [grunts]

20
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:36,471
Come on, Sally. I can't be late.
I'm the one who scheduled this practice.

21
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,390
Right behind you, big brother.

22
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,564
[Charlie Brown] Whoops. Heads up!

23
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,316
Good morning, Charlie Brown.

24
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,527
Good morning, Linus, Lucy.
Are you ready for today's practice?

25
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:54,114
Why do we even bother with practice?
We never win any games.

26
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:56,658
That's exactly why. I'm tired of losing.

27
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,535
Look at it this way, Charlie Brown,

28
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,580
we learn more from losing
than we do from winning.

29
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,750
That must make me
the smartest person in the world.

30
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:08,503
Aren't you going to say good morning
to me, my Sweet Babboo?

31
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,839
I'm not your Sweet Babboo!

32
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,758
What's the plan, Charlie Brown?

33
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,928
New uniforms? New playbook?
A new quarterback?

34
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,055
No, a new coach.

35
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,558
Hmm. Maybe you're not such
a blockhead after all.

36
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,322
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Marcie.

37
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,115
I've been reading up on football.

38
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,160
I'm ready to get out there
and kick around the old hogskin.

39
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:43,580
It's pigskin, Marcie.
And everything isn't "old" in football.

40
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:44,915
Whatever you say, sir.

41
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,876
And don't call me "sir."
Today it's "Coach."

42
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,211
All right, listen up.

43
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,379
[chatter stops]

44
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:52,965
- Chuck here…
- Ah.

45
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:57,052
…has asked me to help his team
get in shape for next season.

46
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,429
Nothing like a good challenge.

47
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,514
[Linus gulps]

48
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,474
Ready to get to work? Good.

49
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:05,561
I like to start my warm-ups
with 100 jumping jacks.

50
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:06,770
Marcie?

51
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:10,315
You heard her. Jump!
[inhales sharply, blows]

52
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:14,027
- [blows whistle] One, two, three…
- [huffing]

53
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:19,867
…four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

54
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,910
- 11, 12, 13…
- [huffing continues]

55
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:25,539
- Sorry I'm late, Coach.
- Hope you have a good excuse, Pigpen.

56
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:33,964
I do. The line at the candy store sure was
backed up due to Mother's Day tomorrow.

57
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,300
[Charlie Brown] What?

58
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:40,012
That's tomorrow? I can't believe
I almost forgot Mother's Day.

59
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,306
[all] Mother's Day?
Mother's Day is special.

60
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,807
Cut the chitchat, Chuck.

61
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,267
Marcie, where were we?

62
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,561
I, uh... I lost count. [giggles]

63
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,104
Oh, forget it.

64
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:52,482
Time for a little demonstration.
What you're about to see

65
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:56,570
is some real down-in-the-dirt,
slam-bang, rock-'em-sock-'em football.

66
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,946
Marcie, bring 'em in.

67
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,364
[gasps]

68
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:01,200

[squeaks]

70
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,078
[Peppermint Patty] Keep your eyes
on the kid with the funny nose.

71
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,122
Look at those moves.

72
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,166
Okay, kid. Enough with the moves.

73
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,669
[Woodstock shrieks, groans]

74
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,505
Let's start with a simple kick.

75
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,005
All right, tee it up!

76
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,298
[whistles]

77
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,680
[groans]

78
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,390
Uh, nice hit, little guy.

79
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:29,144
Shake it off. Forget the kick.
Let's do the passing play.

80
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,733
I never know what my mother would like.
You're clever, Linus. What are you doing?

81
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:38,487
Well, every day my mom puts
these little notes in my lunch sack,

82
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,696
just like this one.

83
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,659
"Dear Son, study hard.

84
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,994
Remember, all you need
to find true happiness

85
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:47,746
is already there within you.

86
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,415
The lunch is just a bonus. Love, Mom."

87
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,210
She gets carried away sometimes.

88
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,587
[Peppermint Patty]
Now go straight out and cut right.

89
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,632
Now left. Now cut back.

90
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,759
[all gasp]

91
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,262
[squeaks]

92
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:06,682
Don't come back.
It's a pass, not a return.

93
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:10,561
This year, I decided to write
a special letter back to thank her.

94
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,564
Unfortunately,
I still need to figure out what to say.

95
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,191
Writing is not really my strong suit.

96
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:20,988
[Charlie Brown] "Roses are... [grunts]
Violets are"... [grunting]

97
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:24,283
This isn't the play! Tackle that guy.

98
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,034
Can he even hear me?

99
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,412
What are you guys doing?

100
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:32,541
I'm making Mom a gift
that will be a true artistic masterpiece.

101
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,168
Oh, really? What's that?

102
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,044
If I knew, I'd tell you!

103
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,424
- What are you getting your mom?
- She's been really nice lately,

104
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:44,136
so I upped her gift
to a crisp five-dollar bill.

105
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,721
How thoughtful of you.

106
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,139
Cold, hard cash.

107
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,474
You don't have the ball.

108
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:52,144
I'm writing a sonata for my mom.

109
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:56,148
I call it, "You're the Best Mom,"
in F major.

110
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,399
My mom loves hugs,

111
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,110
so I'm making her
a coupon book full of them.

112
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:02,821
Stop! Look behind you.

113
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,699
[both shrieking]

114
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:11,330
[Peppermint Patty] Not bad
for a little guy. Run! Go, go go!

115
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,498
[squeaks, grunts]

116
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,919
- [Snoopy sobbing]
- Yeah! Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

117
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,671
Not pretty, but it's a touchdown!

118
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:22,090
- Did you get all… that?
- [chattering]

119
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,759
- Mother's Day.
- Happy Mother's Day.

120
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,135
Isn't Mother's Day the best?

121
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,346
- Happy Mother's Day.
- I love Mother's Day.

122
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:28,972
[grumbling]

123
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,475
[growling]

124
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,060
May I have your attention?

125
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:37,064
Unless you all have something better
you'd rather be doing?

126
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,527
Actually, I need to go
to the craft store for art supplies.

127
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,070
I need to make more coupons.

128
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,781
I still have to work on the last movement
of my sonata.

129
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,825
A card would go nicely
with my box of chocolates.

130
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,203
I should be writing my letter.

131
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:57,000
[chuckles] Sorry, Coach. I should go too.

132
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,628
I'll call you to set up
another practice soon.

133
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,007
All right, go ahead and leave.

134
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,760
But don't blame me
when you lose next season.

by stupid Mother's Day.

I turn back and do a fake-o pass
to the running back.

179
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:55,137
But then I keep the ball to myself,

180
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,973
do a few tricky moves
to avoid the other side,

181
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,934
and run down the field for a touchdown.

182
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,227
Sir…

183
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:05,772
- [panting and grunting]
- This is all very interesting, sir,

184
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:08,692
but maybe we should do this
when the other players are here.

185
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:13,363
No. I refuse to change my plans
just because of Mother's Day. [pants]

186
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:16,450
Maybe we could find something else
that's fun to do.

187
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,493
Who says I'm not having fun?

188
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:21,955
Is this the face of a person
not having fun?

189
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,668
- Do you want to talk about it, sir?
- No.

190
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:36,011
Sir, I'm really sorry
you don't have a mom.

191
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:39,014
I just don't understand
why Mother's Day's such a big deal.

192
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,391
Mother's Day is… dumb!

193
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:45,437
[sighs]

194
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:48,607
[inhales deeply, sighs]

195
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,988
It's nice that we've opened up
this line of communication, sir.

196
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:01,912
[grunts]

197
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:09,753
[grunts, groans]

198
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,548
You should just go home, Marcie.

199
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:15,634
I'm sure you have some things
you need to prepare for tomorrow.

200
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:19,096
Taken care of, sir. I made cupcakes.

201
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,265
I would rather stay here with you.

202
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:25,435
It's the same every year.

203
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,523
I'm having a good day,
and then someone brings up Mother's Day.

204
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:33,986
And suddenly I'm reminded that
I'm the only kid who doesn't have a mom.

205
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,780
It must be difficult, sir.

206
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:38,490
It really is, Marcie.

207
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:48,917
Last year, I pretended to be sick

208
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:51,253
so I didn't have to go
to school that week.

209
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:54,673
I remember. You came down
with a case of the yuckies.

210
00:11:57,885 --> 00:12:00,888
If you want,
you can spend Mother's Day at my house.

211
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,639
I don't mind sharing my mom.

212
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:06,727
Your mom's nice,
but it's just not the same.

213
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,313
Is there anything I can do to help?

214
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,357
I don't know, Marcie.

215
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:16,028
Can you make Mother's Day go away
and never come back again?

216
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,739
Uh, I'm afraid not, sir.

217
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:21,033
I didn't think so.

218
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:27,122
Let's go return Chuck's football.

219
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,753
"To my mom." Hmm. No.

220
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:37,716
"Mommy dearest." Uh, no. [sighs]

221
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:41,470
"O mother of mine." [groans]

222
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:45,432
"Hey, Mom." [groans]

223
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,227
Letter writing is a lost art.

224
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:50,854
"Mother."

225
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:53,065
- Move over, Linus.
- Wha... Uh?

226
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:56,443
I need the table to make
my special Mother's Day present.

227
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:05,410
It's going to be a portrait of Mom
done in watercolor.

228
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,996
She's going to take one look at it
and say,

229
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,707
"That picture belongs
at the top of the fridge."

230
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,501
Sounds like a great idea.

231
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:15,254
I believe the best gifts
come from the heart.

232
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:18,131
Heart, schmeart. This is art.

233
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:24,179
Being a great artist means
having discipline, concentration,

234
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:27,349
and never rushing your masterpiece.

235
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,684
Done!

236
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,021
Uh, have you looked at Mom recently?

237
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:34,189
[yells, grunts]

238
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:40,612
I think I'll make something else.
Something inspired.

239
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:45,117
Whew. There's a fine line
between honest and too honest.

240
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,872
Aren't you going to ring the doorbell?

241
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,707
I don't want to see anybody.

242
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,586
- [groans]
- Do you want to borrow my handkerchief?

243
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,214
I'm not crying, I'm thinking.

244
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:02,426
They sort of look like
the same thing sometimes.

245
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,678
Well, it's here if you want it.

246
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:11,101
[sighs] I don't know why I get so upset.

247
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,854
Maybe because you miss your mom?

248
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:16,940
I never had a mom. How could I miss her?

249
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,943
Well, maybe you miss what moms do,

250
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:22,070
like making your favorite cookies

251
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:24,656
and putting a bandage on your finger
when you have a cut

252
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,200
and singing your favorite song?

253
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:27,618
I don't miss those things.

254
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:32,664
My dad does all that mom stuff for me.
He's the best. [gasps]

255
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:34,499
Your dad is very nice.

256
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,461
Are you okay, sir?

257
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:41,256
Marcie,
there are all types of moms, right?

258
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,593
Of course. Foster kids have terrific moms.

259
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:48,180
So do adopted kids.
Some kids even have two moms.

260
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:53,560
Right. And even kids like me, with no mom,
can have someone who acts like a mom.

261
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:57,898
And all those moms deserve
to be celebrated, don't you think?

262
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,233
Sure they do.

263
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,610
[pants] Well, that's what I'm gonna do.

264
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:04,738
For Mother's Day,
I'm going to celebrate my dad.

265
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,198
It's so simple.

266
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:09,826
All I have to do is get him
one of those Mother's Day gifts.

267
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:12,996
Like a card?

268
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,707
Yes, that's it! A card!

269
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:20,128
I get him a card. And bang!
No more yuckies. Problem solved.

270
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:22,589
Marcie, you're a genius!

271
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,091
I am?

272
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:33,016
I can't believe
it's already Mother's Day tomorrow.

273
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,644
Wasn't it just Mother's Day last year?

274
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:37,354
It happens every year.

275
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,983
But stay focused, Sally.
We need to think of a special gift.

276
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,444
- [clock ticking]
- Hmm.

277
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,239
- [ticking continues]
- Mmm.

278
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:50,075
[yawns]

279
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:59,084
[gasps] Sally, I think I have a plan.

280
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:01,587
What does Mom always say
is her favorite meal?

281
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,505
The one she doesn't have to cook.

282
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:04,631
Exactly.

283
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:08,468
Well, tomorrow we're going to
make her breakfast in bed.

284
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:10,596
Won't that make her sheets soggy?

285
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:15,184
I don't think you understand
the finer details of breakfast in bed.

286
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:18,395
It's served on a tray,
and it's very classy.

287
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,105
It sounds messy to me.

288
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:22,524
Trust me, she's going to love it.

289
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:24,693
But we should do a test run first.

290
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,446
Bring me the good plates
from the china cabinet.

291
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,239
Aye, aye, big brother.

292
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,037
Hmm.

293
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:38,874
[grunts]

294
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:42,920
[groans, grunts]

295
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,129
Ooh.

296
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:49,843
[grunts]

297
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,014
Whoa. [screams]

298
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,851
Whoa. [screams] Whoa!

299
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:01,104
Whoa. [screams, grunts]

300
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:03,690
[clattering, clanging]

301
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:08,028
Wha... Huh?

302
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,446
[gasps]

303
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:17,496
I thought you said
breakfast in bed wasn't messy.

304
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:21,165
Good grief.

305
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,383
[squeaks]

306
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:33,428

We have arrived. All right.

345
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:20,220
We're looking for a Mother's Day card
that says,

346
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:23,015
"Thanks, Dad,
for being such a good mother."

347
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:25,601
That sounds… logical.

348
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,355
"Dear Mother,
your smile brightens my day." No.

349
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:32,941
"Dear Mother, my love for you"... [scoffs]

350
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:37,404
"To a mother sweeter than sugar."
Not that one either.

351
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,698
Where are the Mother's Day cards
he'd like?

352
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:43,452
Some trucks or sports
or a little bit of flannel?

353
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,996
These are all flowery and mushy. [gasps]

354
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,624
"Mother, O Mother!" Oh, brother.

355
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:50,375
No. Never. Nope.

356
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:52,044
[groaning]

357
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:55,631
[groans]

358
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:58,926
I don't believe it.
There's nothing here for my dad.

359
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,594
Have you seen any cards that say,

360
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,764
"Happy Mother's Day
to the world's greatest grandma"?

361
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:07,226
I want one that's short and sweet,
just like her.

362
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:09,228
[scoffs] Good luck with that.

363
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:14,525
"There is no other like my grandmother.

364
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:17,861
Happy Mother's Day
to the world's greatest grandma."

365
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:19,696
- This is perfect.
- Huh?

366
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,407
Thank you. Oh, Marcie.

367
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:24,409
[Peppermint Patty grumbles]

368
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:25,827
Excuse me.

369
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:29,665
Can you show me where I can find
a Mother's Day card for my father?

370
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:32,084
[droning adult chatter]

371
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,753
Well, you should expand
your card selection.

372
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:38,632
Not everyone has the same sort
of family, you know. Sheesh.

373
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:40,384
Marcie.

374
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:43,053
Sorry.

375
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:45,430
Come on.

376
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,474
I refuse to give up.

377
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:49,017
Let's go.

378
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,895
- [bell chimes]
- What about ice skates?

379
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:53,105
He has weak ankles.

380
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:55,649
- What about flowers?
- He has allergies.

381
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:59,611
- Some jewelry?
- Nice, but too expensive.

382
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:00,696
How about a cake?

383
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:03,031
- He's more of a salty kind of guy.
- [sighs]

384
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:04,408
A day of pampering?

385
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:05,951
He hates cucumber.

386
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:08,871
[trombone playing]

387
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:11,582
Write him a song?

388
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:15,586
[yells] I give up. This is impossible.

389
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:20,883
[squeaking]

390
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:22,176
[Snoopy] Hmm?

391
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:27,890
[squeaking continues]

392
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:33,061
[squeaks]

393
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:35,981
[teeth chatter]

394
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,149
Aw.

395
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:38,692
Hmm.

396
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:48,452
[Snoopy laughing]

397
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,292
[struggling]

398
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:58,629
[screams, blows]

399
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:06,720
- [Snoopy] Whoo-hoo!
- [cheers]

400
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,602
- [sighs]
- [rumbles]

401
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:15,020
[Snoopy clears throat]

402
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:17,773
Aha!

403
00:23:18,774 --> 00:23:20,275
[chatters]

404
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:23,153
Huh?

405
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:24,821
[chuckles]

406
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:26,573
[blows]

407
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:36,542
Mmm.

408
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:40,295
[both laughing]

409
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:49,221
[howling]

410
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:59,773
[wind whistling]

411
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,443
[screams]

412
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:05,863
[both shrieking]

413
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:08,198
- [Snoopy] Huh?
- [squeaks]

414
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:13,579
[Woodstock squeaking, chattering]

415
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:14,663
[shouts]

416
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:19,334
[both scream]

417
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,753
[screaming]

418
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:29,720

- [both scoffing]
- [roaring]

422
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:47,654
[both shriek]

423
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:52,826
Don't you think cleaning up the kitchen
counts as a gift?

424
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,787
We're running out of time.
Let's keep looking.

425
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:00,375
[gasps] How about an ice cream cake?

426
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:04,713
Actually, that's not a bad idea.

427
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:12,721
- [droning adult chatter]
- One ice cream cake, please.

428
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,598
- [droning adult chatter]
- Um…

429
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,141
- Strawberry.
- Strawberry.

430
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:18,185
- [droning adult chatter]
- Make it, um…

431
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:19,978
- Large.
- Large, please.

432
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:21,438
[droning adult chatter]

433
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:23,440
Uh…

434
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:28,070
Sally, I'm a little short.
Do you have any money?

435
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:31,990
[groans] From one mess to another.

436
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:39,998
You know, Mother's Day is just
another commercial scam.

437
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:42,459
- [droning adult chatter]
- Thank you, sir.

438
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:46,797
Should I assume you won't be eating
any of this commercial scam?

439
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,465
Ah, of course I will.

440
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:52,511
When ice cream is involved,
my principles are totally negotiable.

441
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:53,595
[bell tinkles]

442
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:56,765
[humming]

443
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:05,732
I suppose you're wondering
where I got this beautiful crown.

444
00:26:05,816 --> 00:26:07,276
It certainly crossed my mind.

445
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,319
I made it to give to my mom tomorrow,

446
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:12,197
so she can feel what it's like
to be queen for a day.

447
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:15,075
I'm testing it out,
and it feels very good.

448
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:16,076
Hmm.

449
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,287
I'm never going to find something
for my da...

450
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,831
[exclaims, grunting]

451
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:24,877
Mother's Day, Mother's Day…
Everywhere I go, that's all I hear.

452
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,965
I think if I hear "Mother's Day"
one more time, I'll... I'll scream.

453
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:32,301
We got my mom an ice cream cake
for Mother's Day.

454
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:36,471
I was going to get her a vanilla cake
or a chocolate cake for Mother's Day.

455
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:37,556
[grumbles]

456
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:39,766
But Sally suggested strawberry.

457
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:42,686
And that seemed like the perfect flavor
for Mother's Day.

458
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:47,107
[all] Mother's Day. Mother's Day.
Mother's Day. Mother's Day.

459
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:50,235
[groans, screams]

460
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:53,113
Whoa!

461
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:54,239
[gasps]

462
00:26:54,323 --> 00:26:55,824
[gasps]

463
00:26:55,908 --> 00:26:57,367
[gasps]

464
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,871
[gasps, exclaims]

465
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:05,876
[gasps, exclaims]

466
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:08,504
It's ruined! Look what you did!

467
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:12,883
[gasps] S-Sorry, Lucille.

468
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:16,178
Chuck. It's just... [sighs]

469
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:18,430
Uh, no time to explain.

470
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:21,016
Sir, come back.

471
00:27:21,517 --> 00:27:24,728
Apparently Mother's Day
is not her favorite holiday.

472
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:32,861
- Sir? Where are you going?
- Home.

473
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:40,702
All I wanted to do was get my dad
a Mother's Day gift. I couldn't do that.

474
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:42,412
- Maybe we can...
- No, Marcie.

475
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:44,915
Whatever you're going to say,
I don't want to hear it.

476
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:47,960
Every time you try to help,
I end up feeling worse.

477
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:51,547
I... I'm sorry, sir.
That was never my intention.

478
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:55,592
Mother's Day has always been bad for me,
and that's never going to change.

479
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:58,136
So please, leave me alone.

480
00:28:06,228 --> 00:28:07,813
[rustling]

481
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:11,275

482
00:28:11,984 --> 00:28:15,195

00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:19,366
[Woodstock chattering]

484
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,078
[Snoopy] Ooh.

485
00:28:25,122 --> 00:28:27,124
[cheering]

486
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:29,334
[squeaks]

487
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:35,048
[chattering]

488
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:38,135
- [grunts]
- [squeaks]

489
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:43,432
Hmm.

490
00:28:51,148 --> 00:28:52,191
[squeaks]

491
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:55,611

493
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:08,790
[panting]

494
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,880
[squeaks]

495
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,846

[squeaks]

497
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:34,733
Aw. [chattering]

498
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:47,746
[chattering]

499
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:52,835
[sighs]

500
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:54,586
[groans]

501
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,675
[Woodstock groans]

502
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,769
[sniffs, sighs]

503
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:18,735
I bet ants don't have to
celebrate Mother's Day.

504
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:22,823
Lucky ants.

505
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:25,284
Ants are lucky, I suppose.

506
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:28,287
They always seem to know
where they fit in.

507
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,038
[sighs]

508
00:30:30,122 --> 00:30:33,417
Every now and then, my dad says to me,

509
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,336
"Peppermint Patty,
do you know what you are?"

510
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,088
And I always say no.

511
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:44,428
Then he says to me, "You are a rare gem."
And then we laugh about it.

512
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:47,931
But sometimes I wish I wasn't so rare.

513
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:49,933
I think I understand.

514
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:54,605
Today everyone was so excited.
More than excited.

515
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:58,025
They were happy
about celebrating their moms.

516
00:30:58,108 --> 00:31:03,488
And I knew, no matter what I do,
I'll never know how that feels.

517
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:05,073
And I was angry.

518
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:09,661
Have you ever thought
maybe your anger is really sadness?

519
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:15,334
[crying]

520
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:22,633
It's okay to cry, sir.

521
00:31:24,635 --> 00:31:27,763
[sniffles] One tear isn't crying.

522
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,480
Maybe you could get your dad
something else.

523
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:38,607
Don't start that again.

524
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:41,777
I was thinking, sir,
we tried the usual things.

525
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,861
But you are rare.

526
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:46,657
Is there something you could give him
that could only come from you?

527
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,325
I don't know.

528
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:52,120
Well, what are your favorite things
to do together?

529
00:31:52,204 --> 00:31:53,622
[sighs]

530
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:54,957
Everything.

531
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:59,211
We play baseball.
He taught me all I know about football.

532
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:04,466
We like to tell each other dumb jokes.
The dumber they are, the more we laugh.

533
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:08,720
He loves to hear me laugh.
He says it reminds him of my mom.

534
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:10,472
[gasps]

535
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:13,851
- Huh?
- I know how to celebrate Mother's Day.

536
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:16,603
Tomorrow I'll spend the whole day
with my dad.

537
00:32:16,687 --> 00:32:20,649
We'll play and talk to each other,
and I'm gonna make him laugh.

538
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:22,192
And he'll make me laugh.

539
00:32:22,276 --> 00:32:25,404
And together
we'll share the biggest laugh ever.

540
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:29,408
That sounds like the best
Mother's Day gift a father has ever had.

541
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:32,286
Yeah! Yeah! It does! I gotta go!

542
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:33,370
[clears throat]

543
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:39,251
Marcie, if I said anything before
to hurt your feelings, I'm sorry.

544
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:42,004
- You're a true friend. Mmm.
- You are too, sir.

545
00:32:42,087 --> 00:32:45,007
[both chuckling]

546
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:48,385
And wish your mom
a happy Mother's Day for me! [chuckles]

547
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:50,387
Will do, sir.

548
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:55,017
[Lucy blows]

549
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,732
This is good.
But is it top-of-the-fridge good?

550
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,442
Ahem.

551
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:13,744
It's definitely top-of-the-fridge quality.

552
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:15,871
Oh, thank goodness.

553
00:33:15,954 --> 00:33:18,624
I was starting to think
I had a self-doubt.

554
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:22,252
- But it's still missing something.
- What? But you just said...

555
00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:25,047
All cards need a message inside.
It's a rule.

556
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,551
Okay, wise guy. What does your letter say?

557
00:33:30,344 --> 00:33:31,345
Here.

558
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:37,226
Hmm. [gasps] Aw. Mmm.

559
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:42,940
Linus. It's...
It's everything I wish I could say.

560
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:47,611
Well, you know,
my letter needs something to go in.

561
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:50,197
If you want,
we can put it inside your card

562
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,282
and give them both to Mom together.

563
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:53,867
You'd do that?

564
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:58,288
It just needs one little change here.

565
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:07,214
[clears throat] "Dear Mom,
I'm writing you this letter to thank you

566
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:09,675
for the notes you put
in my school lunches.

567
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:14,721
Also, to thank you for my school lunches,
especially the bologna sandwiches,

568
00:34:14,804 --> 00:34:17,516
- not so much the tuna fish."
- [gags]

569
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,436
"This is my way of thanking you
for all the things you do for me.

570
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:25,482
<i>When I'm scared,
you give me cuddles and act so sweet.</i>

571
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,654
<i>When I'm lonely,
you call me your 'forever best friend.'</i>

572
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:31,947
<i>I like that.</i>

573
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:37,494
<i>You always find the time
to listen to my new ideas."</i>

574
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,168
<i>"You give me lots hugs and kisses,
even in front of my friends,</i>

575
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:48,505
<i>which is sometimes embarrassing,
but I still like them.</i>

576
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:53,969
<i>When I make mistakes,
you encourage me to try again and again.</i>

577
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:02,561
<i>You make sure I'm safe every night.</i>

578
00:35:03,645 --> 00:35:06,648
<i>You give me your best
in your own special way."</i>

579
00:35:06,732 --> 00:35:08,066
[snores]

580
00:35:10,861 --> 00:35:11,945
[grunts]

581
00:35:12,029 --> 00:35:13,864
Go long, Dad. [chuckles]

582
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:15,908
Oh, nice catch.

583
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:18,452
[chuckles] Say goodbye to that one, Dad.

584
00:35:18,535 --> 00:35:21,747
Here's another one.
What did the egg say to the chef?

585
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:24,374
- [droning adult chatter]
- "You crack me up."

586
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:26,376
[Linus] <i>"When I'm sad, you make me laugh.</i>

587
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,796
<i>And then you laugh too,
which makes me laugh even more."</i>

588
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,131
[sighs]

589
00:35:31,924 --> 00:35:36,595
"Mostly I know you're someone who loves me
and will always be there for me.

590
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:40,516
I guess that's what moms do.
But you do it the best. That's why"...

591
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:42,809
[whispers] This is where you come in.

592
00:35:42,893 --> 00:35:48,524
We really, really, really love you back.
Happy Mother's Day.

593
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:50,609
[both giggling]

594
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:01,870
[Snoopy] Ooh?

595
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:03,789
- [squeaks]
- Aw.

596
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:05,582
[both chuckling]

597
00:36:10,587 --> 00:36:12,923
- [Woodstock sighs]
- [Snoopy sighs]

598
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:22,933
[howling]

599
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:24,101
[howling continues]

600
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:26,687
[all laughing]

601
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:29,606
[roaring]

602
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:32,693
[all laughing]
