1
00:02:32,168 --> 00:02:33,670
G-46.

2
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,445
Bingo! Heh.

3
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,477
Goodbye, Arkham!

4
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,628
That means you!

5
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:42,665
Where?!

6
00:04:58,982 --> 00:04:59,932
Bingo.

7
00:05:40,523 --> 00:05:42,025
Huh?

8
00:05:44,027 --> 00:05:46,029
Tweet, tweet.

9
00:05:58,574 --> 00:05:59,542
split the take.

10
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:39,365
Instant karma, Joker.

11
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:02,438
Batsy. You're such a card.

12
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:35,254
Which crypt's
Got the money casket?

13
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,930
Tombstone with the-

14
00:07:51,154 --> 00:07:52,655
Ugh.

15
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,296
Catch! Hee, hee!

16
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,880
Give it up.

17
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,658
This must be the place

18
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,163
I'll take what's behind
door number one.

19
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,020
Like that'll stop me.

20
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,815
Show me the money.

21
00:10:12,962 --> 00:10:13,879
Ow!

22
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:17,750
I'm bleeding!

23
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,414
Where is that loot?!

24
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,126
What's that?

25
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,162
Show's over.

26
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,533
The show must go on.

27
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,963
You wouldn't leave your
pal hanging now, would you

28
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:36,806
Almost had you.

29
00:13:47,543 --> 00:13:49,044
Blood.

30
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,970
Hey! Cemetery's
closed!

31
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,740
That will do.

32
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,981
Looks like I'm the main course.

33
00:14:46,402 --> 00:14:48,737
Aah! Dead guys
don't do that!

34
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:54,026
Not dead.

35
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,379
while I sleep.

36
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,264
You.

37
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:26,108
And Cobblepots
do not serve.

38
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,516
I shall darn t hat straightaway, sir.

39
00:16:16,158 --> 00:16:18,110
Tonight,
Joker met his demise.

40
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:26,835
Penguin's trail went
completely cold.

41
00:16:41,684 --> 00:16:44,186
This is Gotham City.

42
00:16:58,901 --> 00:17:02,705
events which occurred
following my death.

43
00:17:12,214 --> 00:17:15,667
far from Transylvania.

44
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:25,144
Now, take me on a tour
of this Gotham...native guide.

45
00:17:26,261 --> 00:17:30,649
The night is young,
and still I thirst.

46
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,444
Where's your cameraman?

47
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:32,411
with such a beautiful view.

48
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:45,090
Would you believe,
I have to wrap this up?

49
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,938
I meant as my date.

50
00:19:31,553 --> 00:19:34,389
how was your dinner
with the lovely Vicky Vale?

51
00:19:56,912 --> 00:19:59,414
I'm not gonna lose
anyone else on my watch.

52
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:42,791
Oh! My purse!

53
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:45,210
Geh!

54
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,435
A rent-a-cop?

55
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:28,206
My legacy has been
quite influential.

56
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:49,060
It wasn't just the teeth.

57
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:08,330
with the ravishing
Vicky Vale on your arm

58
00:24:18,673 --> 00:24:22,060
Time for my master
to rise and shine.

59
00:24:26,982 --> 00:24:30,318
You have places to be,
people to bite!

60
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:20,652
there's one bird you'll have
to knock off his perch.

61
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:44,926
Pat Foley and guest.

62
00:26:02,611 --> 00:26:04,863
You, attend to the spill
in the study.

63
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:24,883
does nothing of the sort.

64
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:28,446
these beings cloak themselves
as normal members of society.

65
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,674
we've gotta
circulate.

66
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,130
Tall, dark and... weird?

67
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:08,703
Hors d'oeuvres?

68
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:16,461
Exquisite.

69
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,252
I prefer my meat cooked.

70
00:28:30,258 --> 00:28:33,812
But you must.
It really packs a punch.

71
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,693
to wash this down.

72
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,670
There's someth
ing I need to attend to.

73
00:29:41,963 --> 00:29:43,965
I don't remember how.
I got out here.

74
00:29:47,302 --> 00:29:48,803
Alucard.

75
00:29:53,475 --> 00:29:54,476
Master Bruce?

76
00:30:20,869 --> 00:30:22,754
Looking for
some munchies?

77
00:30:30,378 --> 00:30:31,346
You, there.

78
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:33,798
Circulate.

79
00:30:55,236 --> 00:30:56,538
Was I not clear
the first-

80
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,324
Oh, dear.

81
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:09,717
Oh. Leaving
before dessert?

82
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,228
Tomorrow morning,
on Gotham TV News

83
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,902
Sorry, Vicky... I'll be right back.

84
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:47,755
The mirror... He had no reflection.

85
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,042
Sir? Did you hear me?

86
00:31:53,962 --> 00:31:54,963
Thanks.

87
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:01,469
His name.

88
00:32:02,303 --> 00:32:03,855
Alucard.

89
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:03,081
there's a chance
it can be treated.

90
00:33:17,712 --> 00:33:22,133
Especially when it is
courtesy of Dr. Thomas Wayne.

91
00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:37,732
If only I were shallow.

92
00:33:49,544 --> 00:33:53,581
The question is, when will you
let someone rescue you?

93
00:34:01,389 --> 00:34:02,340
Vicky Vale.

94
00:34:06,094 --> 00:34:07,562
I'm on my way.

95
00:34:21,776 --> 00:34:24,112
You are meant
for each other

96
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:48,853
is none other than...

97
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:55,810
in the relationship.

98
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,433
You know, as in blood.

99
00:35:41,155 --> 00:35:44,575
You have been in the gra
ve a long time, master.

100
00:35:48,029 --> 00:35:53,000
Even her name possesses
a mysterious allure.

101
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:59,674
I think it's time
to seek my bride.

102
00:36:10,718 --> 00:36:12,186
at Gotham Cemetery.

103
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:22,480
are not the only objects
I enhanced with garlic

104
00:37:04,405 --> 00:37:08,326
Not if vampires
have an aversion to crosses.

105
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:02,964
Ugh!

106
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,060
Unh!
Ugh!

107
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:18,346
Aah!

108
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:59,530
To attain speed, stren
gth and immortality.

109
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,012
Dripping with garlic.

110
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:21,936
I shall most certainly
steer clear of those.

111
00:41:03,477 --> 00:41:06,480
Try as you may,
you cannot out-bat me.

112
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:36,260
Join me, Batman.

113
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:27,811
until maggots
feed upon your flesh.

114
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:41,659
Alfred...

115
00:42:44,778 --> 00:42:45,746
Oh, dear.

116
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,178
You.

117
00:44:06,493 --> 00:44:08,495
Only a dream, Master Bruce.

118
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,758
Sir?

119
00:44:28,716 --> 00:44:31,218
As if he were the son of Dracula

120
00:44:41,562 --> 00:44:43,313
He'll be hungry and cranky

121
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,656
Huh. Almost dark.

122
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:58,796
You!

123
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:26,490
No! There's nothing in there!

124
00:45:29,276 --> 00:45:31,161
Thought we were partners

125
00:45:44,425 --> 00:45:46,376
There's nothing here for you.

126
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:10,200
Ooh. That is o ne fat-looking vault.

127
00:46:11,652 --> 00:46:12,653
No, Joker!

128
00:46:13,654 --> 00:46:15,622
That's one good-looking corpse.

129
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:30,337
Breakfast in bed.
Fresh-squeezed.

130
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:55,946
wanna give blood?

131
00:47:10,544 --> 00:47:12,095
It's a blood bank.

132
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,256
Undead and kicking!

133
00:48:40,968 --> 00:48:42,386
Yah.

134
00:48:59,653 --> 00:49:00,904
Ew.

135
00:50:14,061 --> 00:50:17,030
We have our test subject.

136
00:50:59,606 --> 00:51:01,024
With a little bloodwork.

137
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,583
Solar generator
prepped and reader, sir.

138
00:53:05,031 --> 00:53:07,617
Joker's blood di
dn't withstand the sunlight

139
00:53:40,767 --> 00:53:44,821
I can smell the precious nectar
pumping through your veins

140
00:53:57,918 --> 00:54:00,453
that it is difficult
to separate fact from fiction.

141
00:54:08,295 --> 00:54:10,297
her blood-thirst
rivaled even his own.

142
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:38,625
The horror

143
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,544
Tell her I'm running late.

144
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,251
Coming

145
00:54:58,645 --> 00:55:00,563
Please do come in.

146
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:16,246
Then feed me!

147
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:25,121
Got ketchup?

148
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:46,860
get close.

149
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:51,314
You have been
most patient, Miss Vale.

150
00:55:57,787 --> 00:55:59,739
Uh, that would be dinner.

151
00:56:07,247 --> 00:56:10,050
He isn't coming, is he?

152
00:56:27,233 --> 00:56:30,070
Burning up inside.

153
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:33,990
I can't take it anymore!

154
00:56:39,279 --> 00:56:41,698
Have mercy on a sad clown.

155
00:56:58,932 --> 00:57:01,468
I am his vessel.

156
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:18,034
you complete me.

157
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:57,323
Stable.

158
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:05,248
Astonishingly, she still
speaks the world of you.

159
00:58:18,511 --> 00:58:20,430
Lunch.

160
00:58:24,217 --> 00:58:25,635
You're late!

161
00:58:34,227 --> 00:58:36,062
Hmph!

162
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:09,429
No. Just insane.

163
00:59:10,763 --> 00:59:13,766
Which is why you're
going back to Arkham.

164
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:24,494
so does the victim's
memory of it.

165
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:36,539
Hopefully, that won't be
an issue after tonight.

166
00:59:51,804 --> 00:59:55,608
Dracula may walk like a man...
but he's a monster.

167
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:00,530
Wait up!
Wait!

168
01:00:44,357 --> 01:00:45,858
Have a good night,
doctor.

169
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:52,341
after returnin g Vicky's call.

170
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:06,656
Sir?

171
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:15,331
Vicky.

172
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:33,433
I think Vicky's
been patient enough.

173
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:35,802
Right, then.

174
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:18,978
the blood wedding.

175
01:03:38,164 --> 01:03:41,167
Meet my true bride.

176
01:03:51,511 --> 01:03:52,512
Ashes?

177
01:04:00,853 --> 01:04:05,691
Mere blood cannot repair her,
as it would a punctured heart.

178
01:04:17,236 --> 01:04:20,289
upon the very essence
of life itself.

179
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:24,327
Master...take my soul.

180
01:04:35,221 --> 01:04:37,256
Joker's footprints.

181
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:54,824
So this is how Dracula
bypassed the crosses.

182
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:03,499
Apparently, so did he.

183
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:34,447
An unwanted guest.

184
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:49,865
Huh?

185
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:01,343
I don't know, but let'
s get everyone out of here.

186
01:08:20,613 --> 01:08:21,614
Agh!

187
01:08:26,152 --> 01:08:29,155
You dare interrupt
the ceremony.

188
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:37,630
Huh?

189
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:50,509
No human can resist my will.

190
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:56,265
Ugh.

191
01:09:56,909 --> 01:09:57,910
Ugh!

192
01:10:01,547 --> 01:10:02,581
My bride!

193
01:10:16,395 --> 01:10:17,346
Batman?

194
01:10:39,952 --> 01:10:41,420
Go!

195
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:04,109
The sunrise will not help you
this time.

196
01:11:47,936 --> 01:11:50,356
I can smell your blood.

197
01:12:02,001 --> 01:12:04,086
from within the catacombs?

198
01:12:54,386 --> 01:12:55,170
Come here!

199
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:57,399
I do hope
this is a positive turn.

200
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:54,673
Count Dracula?

201
01:15:12,975 --> 01:15:14,309
Oh, dear.

202
01:15:29,575 --> 01:15:33,996
Now, where did you
disappear to, my pretty?!

203
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:44,056
Here's Ozzy!

204
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:55,567
Ohh!

205
01:16:17,923 --> 01:16:20,425
It shall be your tomb.

206
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:25,631
Bite this.

207
01:16:41,146 --> 01:16:43,065
Ugh!

208
01:16:49,988 --> 01:16:54,876
but no earthly medicine can cure
a supernatural affliction.

209
01:17:16,898 --> 01:17:19,401
I am the Prince of-

210
01:17:41,173 --> 01:17:42,174
You are...

211
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:44,843
Bruce Wayne.

212
01:17:48,964 --> 01:17:50,966
And The Batman.

213
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:53,719
And you're dust.

214
01:18:13,038 --> 01:18:16,491
I shall sweep that into
the dustbin, straightaway.

215
01:18:26,334 --> 01:18:28,804
blood and stuff, and...

216
01:18:32,007 --> 01:18:32,924
Huh?

217
01:18:42,601 --> 01:18:44,019
Huh?

218
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:42,661
See any vampires,
Vicky?

219
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:46,581
Just bats.
