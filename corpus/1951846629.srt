1
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,300
What?

2
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,600
What took so long?

3
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,100
-I'm sorry?
-It wasn't that far back.

4
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Yeah? Well, I had to look around a bit.

5
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,000
-What for?
-Nobody was there.

6
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,000
-What do you mean, nobody was there?
-I don't know. Just like I said.

7
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,800
So, you just filled them up and took off?

8
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,400
I left money on the counter.

9
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,000
Qkay.

10
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,700
Hey.

11
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,000
It must be back at my place.

12
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,900
Well, I guess I won't be seeing that again.

13
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,900
Son of a bitch.

14
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,000
-Give it up.
-Hey, they're making them smaller, I swear.

15
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,700
-Making what smaller?
-His balls.

16
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,300
-What?
-Yeah.

17
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,700
-I'm serious.
-Since when do you golf?

18
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,800
I'll have you know,
it is a very good tension-reliever.

19
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,300
Be careful with them.
Those belong to Ted's uncle, I think.

20
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,700
What am I gonna do, bend the shafts?

21
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,000
Four-letter word for ''exclude.''
Second letter is ''M.''

22
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,500
-What are you doing with those?
-Qh, the fridge is full.

23
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,800
''Qmit.''

24
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,300
Qkay, baby, this is the one.

25
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,500
Qh! Damn it!

26
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:59,500
-Shoot. Locked.
-Qh, man. Teddy, there's no key.

27
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,600
-Look over the door.
-It's not up here.

28
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,900
It used to be up there.

29
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,400
-And it's...
-Try it again. Qh.

30
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,100
-Throw the beers in the lake?
-Yeah, okay.

31
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,600
-Bryce?
-Hey, Lily.

32
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,100
Hey.

33
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,300
Bryce?

34
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,600
-Yeah?
-Can I talk to you for a minute?

35
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,800
-Sure, babe.
-Inside?

36
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,700
Yeah, I'll be right in.

37
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,300
Well?

38
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,000
I don't know.

39
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,400
-Well?
-What?

40
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,300
-What are we gonna tell them?
-Tell them whatever you want.

41
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,700
-Well, what are you going to tell them?
-As little as possible.

42
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,700
-Hey, guys.
-Qh, hey!

43
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,500
-Hey, you.
-Hey.

44
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,200
So, have you heard from Ted?

45
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,100
-He's not here?
-No. Shocking, isn't it?

46
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,700
-You the first one up again?
-You know me.

47
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,000
Well, come on, lovely.
Let's get this weekend started.

48
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,200
-Qh, Kim?
-What?

49
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,300
You want to take your bags up with you?

50
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,700
-Well, can't you take them all in?
-Well, it'd be easier if you took yours.

51
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,500
What's the matter?
Don't want to break a nail?

52
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,700
No, I just gotta take the gas can
down to the boat.

53
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,900
Darling, they sold that boat.

54
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,100
Well, whatever. Look, you don't have to.

55
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,000
It's fine.

56
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,400
Geez, give me one, too, why don't you?

57
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,200
Thanks, Evie.

58
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,500
I was joking.

59
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,000
I mean, you know you personally
have fucked the whole weekend, right?

60
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,600
-What do you mean?
-You know what he means.

61
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,800
No, no, no, please, enlighten me here.
Tell me.

62
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,600
No. No. Whatever. Whatever.

63
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,500
I mean, like, you couldn't have...
You know what?

64
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
You couldn't have waited?

65
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,500
-You couldn't wait to break up with her.
-What was I supposed to be waiting for?

66
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,100
Fucking Monday?

67
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,200
Qh, and I'm fine, by the way, guys.
Thanks for asking.

68
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,300
So, what? So, what?

69
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,500
So, we're supposed to actually just, like,
walk around on eggshells

70
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,400
while you two are all, like,
tense with each other?

71
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,700
-Again.
-Again?

72
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,000
-Again.
-Yeah, again.

73
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,500
-New Year's Eve, three years ago, buddy.
-That was three years ago?

74
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,800
-Yup.
-That was brutal.

75
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,600
Penultimate worst.

76
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,700
-That was the penultimate worst?
-Yes, it was.

77
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,900
-You don't wanna say ''penultimate.''
-Yeah, I do.

78
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,300
-You wanna say ''ultimate.''
-No, I wanna say ''penultimate.''

79
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,900
''Penultimate'' means second-to-last.

80
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,000
Yeah, but that was the last time
we all got together.

81
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,600
That's not the same thing.

82
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,100
So, what, you're saying I should have
discussed it with you guys first?

83
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,700
You know what, Matt? We're trying
to come up here and have a nice weekend,

84
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,100
and now this.

85
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Was it definite?

86
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,400
-It just slipped out.
-How...

87
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,100
Excuse me? How...
How does that just slip out?

88
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,600
I don't know.

89
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,300
Well, what?
What, did she beat it out of you?

90
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,100
Yeah, I think she beat it out of him.

91
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,400
Nobody beat it out of me. I just said it.

92
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,500
Great.

93
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,800
Tasty.

94
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,900
So, what? What... I mean, what did she say?

95
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,100
I mean, was she surprised? I mean, was she,
like, totally, totally, completely shocked?

96
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,100
-''Was she, like, totally, totally, totally...''
-Dash... Yo.

97
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,900
You know what, guys? I really
don't want to discuss it anymore. All right?

98
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,100
Drama of the week.

99
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,800
I thought you guys were doing
the whole open thing.

100
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,100
Qh, fuck, D, listen,
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

101
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,000
I don't know anyone who would agree
to do the whole open thing.

102
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,000
We're supposed to tell each other
if there's someone else.

103
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,900
Really? And that's supposed
to make things better?

104
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,300
I think it's respectful.

105
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,600
More respectful is just not saying anything.

106
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
Ignorance is bliss, right?

107
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,400
So, what, he didn't tell you anything?

108
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,700
Which could mean that there's nobody.

109
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,400
Qr that there could be somebody.

110
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,900
Should've got that place together
when you had the chance.

111
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,200
Eve!

112
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,900
Just being honest.

113
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,500
Eve's still looking hot.
We can talk about that.

114
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,400
What have you guys been up to?

115
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
Shit.

116
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,600
Long-distance relationships are hard.

117
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,300
What?

118
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,000
What? What are you talking about?

119
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,700
You... You've been with the same girl
since you were what, like, three?

120
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,000
And you cheat on her constantly.

121
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,100
-No. Hey!
-Give me that.

122
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,900
Can I have that, please?

123
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,400
No, I don't.

124
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,400
-You don't?
-I don't do that anymore.

125
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,500
-Qh, you don't...
-What? I don't do that anymore.

126
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,300
-Qh, you... Qh, I'm sorry.
-Qh!

127
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,600
For the record.

128
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,700
Really? Because that's...
That's not what it looked like

129
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,300
-that time that chick was sitting down...
-No, no, no, no, no.

130
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
-No? Qh.
-No. No.

131
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,400
-No, because... No.
-No?

132
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
-No?
-Yes, but no, I don't...

133
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,700
-I'm like really trying not to do that anymore.
-Good for you.

134
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,400
So, you don't, but you do?
Is that your final answer?

135
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,300
I just think, you know,
I'm getting too old for it.

136
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,100
-Too old to be chasing it all the time and...
-So, let me get this straight.

137
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,800
Essentially, you're saying
that you're too tired to cheat on your wife?

138
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,300
No, what I'm saying is, it's like,

139
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,000
I've just traded the quality for the quantity
too many times.

140
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,500
Yeah, well, Dash, a lot of the people try to
figure that out before they get the ring on.

141
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Yeah, well, I figured that one out
the hard way, then, didn't l?

142
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,000
And I'm making up for it now.

143
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Like, we haven't seen each other
more than two times this year,

144
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,900
and all of a sudden
you're an expert on my marriage?

145
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,600
This conversation's killing my buzz.

146
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,700
Look, all I was trying to say, anyway,

147
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,000
is life is a fucking series
of long-distance relationships.

148
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,000
You know, your family,
your friends and that...

149
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,700
We're all in a long-distance relationship.

150
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,800
-Wow, that's deep.
-Yup.

151
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,600
-That must be some good pot.
-It is some good pot.

152
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,400
Yeah, it's not bad.

153
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,200
-And anyway, what about your girlfriend?
-What about her?

154
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,500
She's kind of got that whole
Catholic-school-girl thingy going on.

155
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,100
-I was thinking the same thing.
-Yo, guys, she's having a nap. Just...

156
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,100
You got her all locked up in detention?

157
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,800
Are you gonna go back there and give her
a couple of smacks with your ruler?

158
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,300
-Dashiell!
-She gotta do some schoolwork

159
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,700
-before she comes out?
-Dash!

160
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,900
Maybe, I should go back there
and help her clean the chalkboard?

161
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,500
-Yeah?
-Well, how old is she, anyways?

162
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,600
-Discretion, always the better part of valor.
-I'm 22, actually.

163
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,100
What's up?

164
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,300
I'm gonna go for a walk.

165
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,600
Qh, the girls are down swimming,
if you want, at the dock.

166
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,800
Qh, I just kind of feel like going for a walk.

167
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,900
Baker, remember that time
at Jennifer Warren's party

168
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,400
when you pissed on Jane Caufield, man?

169
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,700
-Tell her about standing on the boards...
-He doesn't know what he's talking about.

170
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,200
-Remember that? That was...
-He's a bit insane.

171
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,500
-That was not... That wasn't me.
-That was so you. That was hilarious.

172
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,500
-Sure.
-Where the hell is Ted anyway?

173
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Sorry, I thought it was you, man.

174
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,600
Qh, look, she's going out to play.

175
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,600
Be nice.

176
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,900
You didn't have to try to make small talk
with her for three hours

177
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,900
waiting for someone else to get here.

178
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
She just doesn't know anyone.

179
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,100
Anyone her own age anyway.

180
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,800
-Where did he meet her?
-Babysitting.

181
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,900
Hey, weren't you supposed to be
bringing some new guy up this weekend?

182
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,700
-Yeah, Eve, what happened with that?
-Same thing that always happens.

183
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,600
Qh! His wife wouldn't let him.

184
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,700
No. This guy wasn't married, he wasn't
cheating with me on someone else.

185
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,200
I don't know, maybe that was the problem.

186
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,800
You know, just with all of them,
I get to that point

187
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,800
where things just seem broken and I just
don't have the energy anymore to fix it.

188
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,500
-Can you change this song?
-Why, you don't like it?

189
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,700
No.

190
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,700
Qh, that's new.

191
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,000
I thought you were all anti-tattoo,
anti-piercing, anti-scarification.

192
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,500
No, no, I never said that.

193
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,300
-Qh, yes, you did.
-No!

194
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,500
-Really?
-Yes, you did.

195
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,200
Well, if I did, I don't remember it.

196
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,900
Anyway, Dash and I both got these.
We did it instead of renewing our vows.

197
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,300
-His idea?
-Yes, it was his gift to me.

198
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,400
Amber, did you know
when he was cheating on you?

199
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,700
Well, in my case, Kim, it was a little obvious.

200
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,000
-No, I mean, I wasn't talking about...
-Walking in on him?

201
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,800
Qkay, you know what?
I don't want to talk about this.

202
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,900
Qkay? I mean, it was...
It was a one-time thing,

203
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,200
and he's not like that anymore.

204
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,200
-So, things are good?
-Well, they're better.

205
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,200
You're lucky.

206
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,800
-You look like you could use one.
-Yeah. Thanks, Eve.

207
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,800
-It's good to see you.
-Yeah, you, too.

208
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,800
-So?
-So-so.

209
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,200
-You look good.
-So do you.

210
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,100
I like your hair.

211
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,500
Yeah? I don't know. I'm growing it.
I'm still not sure if I like it.

212
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,500
-So, you guys gonna try and work it out?
-Why'd I know you were gonna say that?

213
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,400
Because I'm obviously terribly predictable.

214
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500
I knew you were gonna say that.

215
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:22,700
I don't know. You know?
What do you want me to say? We'll see.

216
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,000
Why, what'd she say?

217
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,900
Hey, see that?

218
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,300
-What's that?
-I got them for you. They're veggie burgers.

219
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,800
-Qh, sweetie, I eat meat now.
-What? Since when?

220
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,000
These things make you sickly.

221
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,500
How was your nap?

222
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,500
It's freezing.

223
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,700
Trying to call your girlfriend?

224
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,600
Trying to get a hold of Ted.
It keeps saying, ''Call was lost.''

225
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,700
-Think he got the dates wrong?
-I doubt it. The weekend was his idea.

226
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,700
We are talking about the same Ted here,
aren't we?

227
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,900
Yeah.

228
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,200
Whatever, it's not like
we're locked out or anything.

229
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,400
So, what are we gonna do?
We're just gonna eat?

230
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,500
We're not gonna wait for him?

231
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,100
Why don't you try the reception
out by the road?

232
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,900
Qh, forget it. It's his problem.

233
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,100
Did you try holding your golf club
up over your head?

234
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,500
''Did you try holding your golf club...''

235
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,800
-Hey, Lily. You hungry?
-Yeah, kind of.

236
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,800
We were just starting to wonder
where you'd gone.

237
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,300
I was just walking.
The woods are really beautiful.

238
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,500
-You want a drink?
-I'm good, thanks.

239
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,400
-Drugs?
-No.

240
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,500
You're bleeding.

241
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,000
Yeah, I fell.
Do you guys know where Bryce is?

242
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,100
You wanna maybe put something on that.

243
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,400
Qh, I'm okay. I'm just gonna
put some water on it. Is he inside or...

244
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,900
-He's in there somewhere.
-Qkay, thanks.

245
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,500
Maybe she's rabid.

246
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,100
Rabid.

247
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,300
So? How you getting along with everybody?

248
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,400
Yeah.

249
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,300
Yeah? What do you mean, ''Yeah''?

250
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,300
Yeah. I mean, they all seem nice.

251
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,900
You say that like they don't all seem nice.

252
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:44,100
I just think it would be better and more fun
to be able to hang out with everyone

253
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,700
when, you know, they're sober
and maybe not in a group.

254
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,200
That would, of course,
negate the whole idea of the weekend, but...

255
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,300
So, how's work?

256
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:22,200
-They wanna promote me.
-Matt, that's great.

257
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,500
Yeah, is it? Growing with the company
and all that crap?

258
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,000
Yeah, you sound really excited.

259
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,700
More hours, more responsibility, same pay.

260
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,100
Are you still writing?

261
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,600
No. I'm up at 6:00. I'm home at 7:00.

262
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,000
I mean, who has energy
to do anything else?

263
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,300
Exactly.

264
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,700
What's that supposed to mean?

265
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,000
Nothing. Just that.
I know just what you're talking about.

266
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,800
Qkay, well, it sounds like
there's something else there.

267
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,300
-Oh, really? Well, what does it sound like?
-No, man, I'm exactly the same way.

268
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:04,000
You know, I come home from work,
watch T.V., eat and pass out.

269
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
You know, you rinse and repeat.

270
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,100
Dash, that's not true.
We do stuff on the weekends.

271
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,300
I'm taking a class.

272
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,600
Qh, I'm hardly ever home,
unless I'm sleeping.

273
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,100
It's too depressing.

274
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,400
So, is this what you expected?

275
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,400
Damn, Matt, I don't know, man.
Like, what did you expect it to feel like?

276
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,200
I don't know.

277
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,700
Qlder.

278
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,400
Like, adult?

279
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,800
Yeah, I guess.

280
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,900
Hey, I pay adult taxes.

281
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,800
Would you grow up?

282
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,800
What did you expect? To chase teenagers
around campus bars your entire life?

283
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,600
-Poor, poor Baker.
-Eve, don't start.

284
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,500
I guess now you got your chance, huh?

285
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,600
Hit up a few last calls.

286
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,800
Yeah.

287
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,200
Happy New Year!

288
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:19,200
I'm sorry, honey. It's not usually like this.
Like, it's usually so much more fun.

289
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,800
I mean, how was I supposed to know
they were gonna break up?

290
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,700
-Like, how was I supposed to know?
-Bryce, you think that's the big problem?

291
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,200
-Come on, let's go.
-Where?

292
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,300
Down to the point. I found this great place.
We can go for a swim. It'll be fun.

293
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,900
Honey, why didn't you wanna go earlier
with the girls?

294
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,500
Well, now you and I can be alone.

295
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,000
-We are alone.
-More alone.

296
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,400
-I'm scared of the fish.
-You're a baby.

297
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,300
-Please?
-I just feel...

298
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,500
I feel like I should be with these guys.

299
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,000
I mean, it's the only weekend.
I never see them.

300
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,900
ls it just gonna be a bunch of stories
about funny things

301
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,500
that happened to people you used to know,
I'm never gonna meet?

302
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,700
Yes. Probably. Definitely.

303
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,900
Yeah.

304
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,200
I promise it will not be lame, okay?

305
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,000
-Little bit. A little lame. All right, let's go.
-Maybe.

306
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,900
Come on.

307
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,300
Qkay, Amber. Truth.

308
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,100
What's the weirdest thing
that's ever happened to you?

309
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,800
The weirdest thing? Qh, man, I don't know.

310
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,800
Nothing weird ever happens to me.

311
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,300
Qkay, I guess...

312
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,500
I think I saw a UFQ this one time.

313
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,400
Someone else go.

314
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,900
How about the Hag Syndrome?

315
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,200
You know that thing when you wake up

316
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,000
in the middle of the night
and you can't move,

317
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,600
and you get this pressing down
on your chest,

318
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,500
and you feel like something's
in a room with you?

319
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,200
Yes, I've totally had that.
It scares the crap out of me.

320
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,600
ls that what that is?
When you feel all numb and cold?

321
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,800
So, what do they call it
the Hag Syndrome for?

322
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,100
Because they used to say it's like a hag's
crawled on top of you, holding you down.

323
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,900
Yeah, I've had that,
and you, like, want to scream but you can't.

324
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
And there's, like,
all these voices in your head,

325
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,600
and there's, like, wind
and it feels like you're in a tunnel.

326
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,700
Well, I felt something pulling me
down the bed, it wasn't the hag.

327
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,100
It's just sleep paralysis.

328
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,100
Yeah, your brain's awake, but your body's
still asleep and you're dreaming.

329
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,700
That's all it is. I've had it happen.

330
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,200
You know what I think?

331
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:24,400
When that happens,
your soul leaves your body.

332
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,600
That's what I think.

333
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,100
-It was probably just squirrels.
-Qr it was the hag!

334
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,300
Guys, what about Dead Mary?

335
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,100
No. No. No.

336
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,100
We haven't played that
since my 16th birthday.

337
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,800
What is it? What is Dead Mary?

338
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,600
Qh, my God.
You've never heard of Dead Mary?

339
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,900
Where are you from?

340
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,800
It's stupid.

341
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,800
Well, if it's before my time,
I probably don't know it.

342
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,000
Qh, give it up. You're not
that much younger than us. Please.

343
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,300
Hey.

344
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,000
Dead Mary, it's a game.
You go to any room with a mirror...

345
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,700
Like a bathroom.

346
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,800
And you take a candle
and you go in there by yourself,

347
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,900
and you look in the mirror,
and you say her name three times.

348
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Dead Mary. Dead Mary. Dead Mary.

349
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,500
Yeah, I've heard about that,
but isn't it called Bloody Mary?

350
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,400
-No.
-Bloody Mary's the lame version.

351
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,400
So then, who's Dead Mary?

352
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,000
She's a witch.

353
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:51,500
Well, yeah, only she's dead.
So, she's like an eviI spirit.

354
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,000
Hence the whole dead part.

355
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:59,200
She's all rotting flesh,
and her eyes are sunken into their sockets

356
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:03,300
and when she breathes,
she breathes death into you.

357
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,100
-Hey.
-Will you fucking...

358
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,700
Come on.

359
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,100
Then what?

360
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,100
You say her name three times,
and then what happens?

361
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,100
Then you see her, right?

362
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:23,100
You open your eyes,
and she appears in the mirror.

363
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,300
I've seen her.

364
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,200
-Yeah, right. Bullshit.
-I saw her.

365
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,500
-It's true. We did.
-We all did.

366
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,900
Serious?

367
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,300
You all lie.

368
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,400
-Screw you, I lie.
-Guys, come on.

369
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,200
You know what?
lf it's so fake, you take this candle,

370
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,400
and you go into the bathroom,
and you do it.

371
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,800
-No.
-You're scared.

372
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,800
I'll totally do it. Give me the candle.

373
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,500
Dead Mary.

374
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,700
Dead Mary.

375
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,700
Dead Mary.

376
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,700
Who's next?

377
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,300
Come on.

378
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,100
My turn.

379
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,200
Dead Mary.

380
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,100
Dead Mary.

381
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,100
Dead Mary.

382
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,400
Qkay, that was a little bit scary.

383
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,100
Christ.

384
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,300
Hey. Hey, Eve.

385
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,700
-Evie?
-Hey!

386
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,200
You okay in there?

387
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,900
You think she fainted?

388
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,700
-Eve!
-Hey, Eve, are you all right in there?

389
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,900
Well, that was fun.

390
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,600
Who's next?

391
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,300
Qh, I'll go.

392
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,200
Dead Mary.

393
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,100
Dead Mary.

394
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,100
Dead Mary.

395
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,100
What the fuck? Where's the light?
Damn it. Damn it.

396
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,500
Did you fall asleep in there or what?

397
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,100
-Where's Kim?
-She went to bed.

398
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,100
Looks like you're sleeping on the couch.

399
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,000
-You mind if I get in there?
-Qh, yeah.

400
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,800
-You guys staying up?
-Qh, man. No, today's been long enough.

401
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,300
Nothing personal. I just...
Let's start again tomorrow.

402
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,400
-Wanna smoke one?
-Yes.

403
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,000
No.

404
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,200
-Breakfast.
-All right.

405
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,500
Good night, buddy.

406
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,200
See you.

407
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,800
Holy...

408
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,700
Hey.

409
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,500
Bryce!

410
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,900
Bryce! Bryce! Bryce!

411
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,600
-Qh, my God!
-She killed him.

412
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,900
-Qh, my God, she killed him.
-Qh, my God.

413
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,100
She killed him. Qh, my God, she killed him.

414
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,900
-She killed him.
-Who? Who killed who, Lily?

415
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,400
Where did all this blood come from?

416
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,200
-She's crazy. I saw her.
-Who's crazy?

417
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,300
Eve! Eve! She killed him. Qh, my God.

418
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,000
What the hell's going on?

419
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,700
No, no, no, no, no. You stay...
You stay away.

420
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:14,200
-Calm down!
-Hey! Look at me. Hey! Look at me.

421
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:18,500
-Hey, what did you see out there? Honey?
-Matt... Matt...

422
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,200
What? What about Matt?

423
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,700
ln the woods. Matt's in the woods.
He's dead.

424
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,500
Qh, my God.

425
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,600
Don't look at me like that!

426
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,200
-You bitch, I saw you!
-Qkay, just shut up!

427
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,200
-Shut up, honey! Hey!
-I saw you!

428
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,300
-Matt!
-I saw you! I saw you!

429
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,000
-She killed him!
-What are you talking about?

430
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,500
Qh, my God.

431
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,900
-I can't fucking see shit out there!
-Now, goddamn it, listen to me!

432
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,200
Where did the blood come from?

433
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,800
-ln the woods.
-All right, let's go!

434
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,700
What? We don't know
what the fuck is out there.

435
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,200
-What if he's really hurt?
-It'll be light soon.

436
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,900
-I'm not going back out there.
-What were you doing outside, anyway?

437
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:10,700
I just wanted to go for a swim.
I wanted to go earlier but Bryce didn't...

438
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,900
Yeah, that's right.

439
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,700
Well, what the fuck
was Matt doing out there?

440
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,500
I saw them together. At first, l... I thought...

441
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,500
-What?
-What?

442
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,100
-What?
-Qh, you've gotta be kidding me.

443
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,400
I saw them with their flashlights.
They were together.

444
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,100
They were together,
the two of them, outside. I saw them.

445
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,500
What? You think I went
down there with Matty?

446
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,900
I know what I saw.

447
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,400
-Qh, you better shut the fuck up right now.
-Eve.

448
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,400
Whatever, he is not here now.
We need to figure out where he is.

449
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,700
I told you where he is. I told you.
He's down in the...

450
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:51,500
-Shut up, Lily!
-Qkay, look, we're wasting time.

451
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,800
-Are you coming or not?
-No. Bryce, don't...

452
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,400
-Baker!
-I think I need to stay here.

453
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,600
I just want to go home.
Please, I don't want to stay here.

454
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,800
Matty!

455
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,100
What is going on here?
What the fuck is going on here?

456
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,000
-I just want to go home.
-Baker!

457
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,700
-Please.
-Baker, you'd better get out here!

458
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,600
Listen to me, please don't go.

459
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,600
-Let's just go home. Let's just go.
-He's my friend. Watch her for me.

460
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,900
Hurry.

461
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,900
Bryce! Bryce!

462
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,200
Watch her.

463
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:03,300
Qh, no. Qh, no. Qh, no.

464
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,800
Jesus.

465
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,500
No.

466
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,500
Jesus.

467
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,600
-Don't touch him.
-Qh, my God.

468
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,700
We gotta call somebody!
The ambulance, the cops...

469
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,400
With what phone?

470
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,100
So, we drive somewhere
that's got reception.

471
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:29,700
What about her?

472
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,800
-Who?
-Lily.

473
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,100
What about her?

474
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:38,600
You think she did this?
What are you, insane?

475
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,600
A person could not have done this.

476
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,900
I mean, for God's sake,
it looks like he's been chewed.

477
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,200
-It could have been anything. Animals...
-<i>Wake the hell up, Baker!</i>

478
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,600
<i>Why are you even defending her?</i>
<i>Just because you're sleeping with her?</i>

479
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,600
-<i>How well do you know her?</i>
-<i>This is insane. This makes no sense!</i>

480
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,900
<i>It makes complete sense to me.</i>

481
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,600
What?

482
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,400
He moved! He grabbed me!
Baker, he grabbed on to me.

483
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,200
It was a reflex, Kim. It was a reflex.
Bodies do that.

484
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,700
Bodies do not do that.

485
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,600
Qkay, Kim, just relax, okay. Calm down.

486
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:13,900
Baker, he grabbed me,
he touched me and grabbed onto me!

487
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:18,600
-He was holding me!
-Think he's still alive?

488
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:21,800
He's not fucking still alive, Eve.
Qkay? Just look at him.

489
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,800
We need to get an ambulance.

490
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,900
Just stop it, all right?

491
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:46,500
Kim, you should see the look on your face.

492
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:56,100
What's the matter, honey?
You got nothing to say?

493
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:00,100
Course, you wouldn't tell the truth,
anyways, would you?

494
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,200
I guess you could say the same about me.

495
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:08,200
Do you honestly think it was just your face
I saw every time I fucked you?

496
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,200
Jesus, Matt.

497
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,800
Dash, you should know
what I'm talking about, right?

498
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:18,500
How could you even keep track
of what you're fucking, huh?

499
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,700
Well, it seems your little wife has taken
a page out of your own book. Right, Baker?

500
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,900
Let me go!

501
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:29,400
Tell me, Baker, how have you and Amber
kept Dash in the dark for so long, huh?

502
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,900
Let me go!

503
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:46,500
Tell me, Dash,
your wife fucking your best friend?

504
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,700
That's got to be the penultimate worst.

505
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:58,200
But as bad as that is,
you haven't seen anything yet.

506
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,200
Things are just beginning.

507
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,000
They're just beginning.

508
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,400
You'd better run, bitch!

509
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:34,800
Kim!

510
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,200
Baker!

511
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,900
What was that thing
saying about you and Amber?

512
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,400
-Get off me!
-Did you fuck her?

513
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,600
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

514
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,300
Can you stop it in there?

515
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,100
Stop it in there! Stop it.

516
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,500
Nothing?

517
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:22,100
-Nothing.
-So, that makes all three.

518
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,600
Looks like we're walking out of here.

519
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,600
Baker!

520
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,400
Baker!

521
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,300
Baker!

522
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,000
We're gonna need some gas.

523
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,300
No.

524
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,900
I don't think this is such a good spot.

525
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:38,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Guys, I don't think...
We can't just burn him.

526
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:42,500
Christ, Amber! You think anyone
gives a fuck what you think?

527
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,900
Come on, honey.

528
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,800
Get a blanket or a garbage bag.

529
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,900
Dash, get something.

530
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,600
I'm not sure this is such a good spot, either.

531
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,200
-Jesus, Baker.
-What?

532
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,600
-I don't know, man.
-Qh, and I do?

533
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,500
I don't think he's coming back.

534
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,900
Now what?

535
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,600
-What about her?
-Well, she's not coming out of there.

536
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:44,000
Listen, I am still not convinced.

537
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,800
-Surprise, surprise.
-It is impossible.

538
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:52,100
You guys, we really need to not be fighting
with each other right now, okay?

539
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,500
You're right.

540
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,100
Every time I close my eyes,
I see those pieces of my friend.

541
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:11,300
We don't need to relive it.

542
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,700
Maybe you do, Kim.

543
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,400
Maybe you need to think about
what might have happened

544
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,300
if we hadn't been there to witness it.

545
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,000
Think about how that thing
that used to be your boyfriend

546
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,900
might have put itself back together
and come up to the cabin, and then what?

547
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:29,200
He looked exactly the same.

548
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,500
Maybe he crawls into bed with you, Kim,

549
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,600
and maybe for old time's sake,
you let him, huh?

550
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:35,900
Shut up.

551
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,200
You tell me what happens next.

552
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,700
-Maybe you suck that thing off.
-Shut up!

553
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,500
Maybe you let that thing get inside of you.

554
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,700
For God's sake, Kim. You just put a fucking
shovel through your boyfriend's head!

555
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,800
-You're disgusting.
-Would you listen to me?

556
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,700
Kim.

557
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,300
You listen to him.

558
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,200
What's your point?

559
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:10,200
My point is, we would not know.
He looked exactly the same.

560
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:17,100
Dead Matt would be here with us now,
having a coffee or hanging around

561
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,600
or making some bacon or I don't know,
maybe turning us

562
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,700
into whatever the hell it was that he became.

563
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,400
Qr maybe that's already happened.

564
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,600
Maybe it happens to you when you're alone.

565
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,200
Lily.

566
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:43,800
-She was alone in the woods the whole day.
-But she's all tied up, right?

567
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:47,100
Yeah, she is, but you're not.

568
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:01,000
-What? You think I'm like that?
-Lily said she saw you down in the woods.

569
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:05,600
-Lily said she saw you killing Matt.
-I was in bed.

570
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,100
-So you keep telling us.
-No.

571
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:14,900
-No, this is insane.
-Maybe Matt was just always like that.

572
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,600
Dead Mary.

573
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,800
What about it?

574
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,700
You were alone in that bathroom
for an awful long time.

575
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:27,200
So what? So were you.

576
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:30,500
Yeah, not as long as you were.

577
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,700
It's a game.

578
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:39,300
It's supposed to be a fucking game.
There's no real Dead Mary.

579
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,200
I mean, what are you trying to say?

580
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:45,200
That one of us actually conjured her up
in the mirror last night?

581
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:50,100
Even before that.
You were alone yesterday down by the lake.

582
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,900
-You tried to call Ted.
-So what?

583
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
-And you took that nap in the afternoon.
-You're saying that I'm not me?

584
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,800
Maybe none of us are.
Maybe I'm the only one left.

585
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,600
Hey, I'm myself.

586
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,400
Can you prove it?

587
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:12,500
I changed my mind. Bring Lily out here.

588
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,900
-What?
-We test her.

589
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:20,800
-How?
-We cut off her hand and see what happens.

590
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,600
Does that mean we can get to cut off your
hand next, Eve, and see what happens?

591
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,800
I'm not cutting my hand off.

592
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,600
But I'll cut hers.

593
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Nobody is cutting anyone's hand off.

594
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:44,500
Jesus, Lily was alone in the woods,
and Amber's back there with her now.

595
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:48,400
Dash, Amber was alone
with her before, remember?

596
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,600
You were alone with her all night, last night.

597
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:06,500
So?

598
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:11,100
-Now what?
-Wait for Ted.

599
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,800
Like that's ever been an option.

600
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:17,900
What? You're really just
gonna walk out of here?

601
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,400
-What choice do we have?
-Matt went outside and he died.

602
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:27,400
Then we could all just kill each other
in this room.

603
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,100
How about that?

604
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,700
I'm not fucking walking out of here.

605
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,000
Amber?

606
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,200
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean that.

607
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:58,900
You know I didn't mean that.
You know I love you, right?

608
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,800
You know I love you. It's just...

609
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,900
Just go away, Dash.

610
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,000
-Angel...
-No.

611
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:13,700
You can't talk to me like that. You can't
talk to me like that in front of everybody.

612
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:17,800
Angel, I know, okay?
It's just, this thing is so messed up.

613
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,900
Qkay? I am so messed up right now.

614
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,900
I'm not thinking straight.

615
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,900
No, you're not.

616
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,900
Amber, I gotta ask you a question.

617
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,900
-And it's about you and Baker.
-Qh, God. No.

618
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,300
-Baby...
-No, Dash.

619
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:53,400
-Not now. Please.
-You don't think I have the right to know?

620
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,500
I have the right to know.

621
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:03,900
Yes, and I have the right to say
that now is not the time to get into this.

622
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:15,300
What? Qkay, I'm not gonna freak out.

623
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:19,100
I'm not. Just what?

624
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:25,200
Come on, look at me. Qkay, it's me, it's me.
It's Dash.

625
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:31,000
Dash, go away. Please.

626
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:37,300
-Babe?
-Dash, go away, okay?

627
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
-Honey, honey...
-Go away!

628
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:08,100
So, what if Ted never comes?

629
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,300
Qne hit and it's already loose.

630
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:19,700
Give yourself some credit.
It's pretty artsy-craftsy.

631
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:25,100
Yeah, well, give me some popsicle sticks
and some pipe cleaners, and I'm all set.

632
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,900
-Here. Might wanna tighten that up a little.
-Thanks.

633
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,900
Think you'll be able to use it?

634
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,900
I don't know. I guess it depends on who.

635
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,800
Kim.

636
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,200
-I'm sorry about what I said earlier.
-Don't.

637
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:57,100
-No. I went too far, and...
-Stop.

638
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,200
-But, Kim...
-Stop.

639
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:05,800
I know why you think you need to,
and I know you're not really sorry.

640
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,000
Fine.

641
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,900
But you know, I just need to say that

642
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:22,100
if I had to choose, I'm glad it's us in here.

643
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,300
-Where were those?
-Under the brick.

644
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,500
-Great.
-So?

645
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:14,300
-So, one of us stays, one of us goes.
-I'll go.

646
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,500
Now, what if I'm not me and I ambush you?

647
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:23,400
I'd kill you with this
and whatever else I find in there.

648
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:27,500
-And what if there's nothing else in there?
-I'd kill you anyway.

649
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,600
I'm going.

650
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:41,400
-So, what do you see?
-Not much.

651
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,200
-Guns would be nice.
-Yeah. Well, you know what?

652
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:49,700
Call it a hunch, but I don't think
Ted's aunt and uncle are big into hunting.

653
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:50,800
I don't know if you've noticed,

654
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,600
but there really aren't enough
kitchen knives to go around.

655
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:55,200
Yeah. Well, just give me a second.
I'm looking.

656
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:57,500
You're taking too long.

657
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,400
Hold on.

658
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:03,700
What do you see?

659
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,900
There's a croquet set,
I don't know, a couple of oars.

660
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,400
Eve, you wanna step back?

661
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:13,300
-ls there anything sharp in there?
-Not that I can see.

662
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,300
Dash?

663
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,600
He's dead.

664
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,100
Stay back! Stop! Stop!

665
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,500
Stay back.

666
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:03,800
-Dash...
-Where's Dash?

667
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:06,100
Amber! Back in the house!

668
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,600
-Where is he?
-Get in the house and watch Lily!

669
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:12,400
Get back in the house!

670
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:14,100
Where is he?

671
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:19,900
He was one of them. He tried to kill me.

672
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:28,600
Qh, my God.

673
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:37,900
I made him wait outside
when I went in to check. He just came at me.

674
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:40,800
Lucky I found this.

675
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:45,700
Looks like he got you pretty badly, too.

676
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,200
We struggled over it.

677
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:53,000
So, what do we do? Door's busted.
We can't exactly corral him in here.

678
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:56,900
Get Amber to trade us her shovel.

679
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,700
Split up the body parts,
and bury him all over the lawn.

680
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:04,800
And what exactly are we gonna tell Amber
the shovel's for?

681
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:11,500
Plus, if he's anything like Matt,
he would just dig himself back up again.

682
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:14,300
-We gotta burn him.
-Here?

683
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,500
No, out in the woods.

684
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,100
-We have to.
-Not yet.

685
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:08,400
Hey, dude.

686
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,700
What's up?

687
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:17,500
Where's Amber, man?

688
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:23,400
Aren't you gonna have another crack at her,
now that I'm all tied up like this?

689
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:25,500
I know about you two.

690
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:32,500
The time you guys made it to third base
over a cheap bottle of wine in our own bed.

691
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:37,200
-You always treated her like shit.
-Yeah, man, but I married her, not you.

692
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:44,200
So, she's still inside guarding
that new girlfriend of yours? The crazy one?

693
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:48,500
She's gonna kill you.

694
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:58,400
Does she know anything about
the two of you cheating whores?

695
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:02,000
Fuck!

696
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,600
-Fuck you!
-Talk.

697
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:30,000
How do you expect a guy to talk
when you go and do all that to his face?

698
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,800
I thought we were friends.

699
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:36,700
-What do you want?
-What do I want?

700
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:40,900
I want you to stop stabbing me
in the goddamn face with garden tools.

701
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,700
I'll kill you. I will kill you.

702
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:49,200
You kill me, I come back again!
It's one of those circle-of-life kind of things.

703
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,400
I'll kill you anyway.

704
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
But first I want a few answers.

705
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:09,800
Kim, I'm sorry about Matty.

706
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:15,000
I'm sorry about this whole weekend.

707
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,600
-lf I were one of them...
-Are you confessing?

708
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:28,000
lf I were one of them, what do you think
would happen if I were to cry wolf

709
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:31,700
and tell Baker to come outside right now
and help me kill you?

710
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:37,800
-It probably works both ways.
-Probably.

711
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:45,400
Fine! What?

712
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,700
-Why are you doing this?
-Is that all, man?

713
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,500
Qne last time. What do you want?

714
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:59,100
-What do you want?
-You!

715
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:06,200
Dead Mary! Dead Mary!

716
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,900
I can't hear you, Baker! I can't hear you!

717
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:15,500
Sing with me, Baker!
I can't fucking hear you! Huh?

718
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:18,200
Well, so much for the big weekend!

719
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:21,400
What are you all gonna do? What are you
gonna say happened up here, Baker?

720
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:25,200
You all just gonna go on with your lives?
Say it was a bear?

721
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,600
Qh, I know. I know, I know, I know.

722
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:37,900
You're still thinking Alamo, right? Huh?

723
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,900
Right, Baker?

724
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,200
Tell me.

725
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:51,400
Well, the word's not Alamo, Baker.

726
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:57,100
The word is apocalypse.

727
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:01,800
Us, you, right now!

728
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:06,900
And even if you do manage
to make it out alive,

729
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:09,300
that just makes you a survivor.

730
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:14,000
The rest of your life,
you're walking wounded, shell-shocked.

731
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:23,300
Jumping at noises,
sleeping with the lights on,

732
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:26,300
and looking over your shoulders

733
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:30,200
because one day, one of us is gonna be
right there behind you.

734
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:36,700
Besides me, who's left?

735
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,800
Qh, come on. Now, that would be telling.

736
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:03,900
-How far is the nearest cottage?
-I don't know.

737
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:10,500
Where are you going? Baker!
Where are you going?

738
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:17,800
This is a long weekend, right?
Nice, quiet getaway to the country, right?

739
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,100
Then why do we seem to be
the only ones up here?

740
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,900
I mean, have you noticed?

741
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,700
Ever since we got here,
have you smelled any cookouts?

742
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,800
Heard any loud parties, any motorboats,
any water skis?

743
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,700
What are you saying?

744
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:34,400
We're gonna go see who the hell else
is up here with us.

745
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:35,800
We're waiting for Ted.

746
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:40,200
You wanna stay here and bank it all
on a guy that's never gonna show up?

747
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,800
We all go.

748
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:44,800
All of us.

749
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:48,100
Straight line through the woods
to the main road.

750
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:51,500
-No, I'm not going.
-You are definitely not staying here, Eve.

751
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,700
What? You think I'm gonna
go after your girlfriend?

752
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:58,200
Yeah, that's the thing, Eve.
See, it's either you or her.

753
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:03,000
Baker, this is me.

754
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:12,900
So, what, you gonna leave Amber
to hold the fort?

755
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,800
Amber! Amber!

756
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:28,500
What?

757
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:32,700
Listen, we're going for help! All right?
You stay here!

758
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,500
We'll be back as soon as we can!

759
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,100
And, Lily,

760
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:40,600
if you can hear me,

761
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:45,400
I'm gonna get you out of there, hon.
I promise.

762
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,800
Amber, go back inside!

763
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:52,100
Lock all the doors.
Close the shutters, and don't let anybody in!

764
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,800
-Well, what if it's Ted?
-Anybody!

765
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,500
Stop it. Stop it.

766
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:29,300
I said, stop it! Stop that noise!

767
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:33,300
Amber?

768
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,000
Amber?

769
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,100
-Amber!
-How are you talking?

770
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,100
I took the gag out of my mouth.

771
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:49,100
Well, put it back in. I don't wanna hear you.

772
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:51,300
You better wanna hear me!

773
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:55,400
Well, you're a liar, and you're a murderer.

774
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,500
No, I'm not.

775
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:03,300
That's what Eve wants you to think, Amber.
I'm telling you, I saw her.

776
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:08,300
I saw her with Matt in the woods, okay?
I saw her kill him.

777
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:11,400
-I saw her tear his head off.
-No, no, no.

778
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,500
Eve is my friend,
and you don't even know her.

779
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:17,600
You don't even...
You don't even know any of us.

780
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,200
Amber.

781
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:39,500
I need you to listen to me. Qkay? Just...
Just listen to me.

782
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:43,900
-Are you listening?
-No.

783
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:53,200
Just now, when Bryce was outside with Kim,

784
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:55,200
who else was with them?

785
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:02,500
Who else was with them, Amber?
Was it Dash?

786
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:07,500
No. I don't know where he is.

787
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:09,800
Was it Eve?

788
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,900
Amber, was it Eve?

789
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:22,100
Do you know where they went?

790
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:27,800
Where did they go? Do you know?

791
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:31,500
What does it matter, anyway?
You're all tied up in there.

792
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:37,300
You're right. I am. I'm all tied up.

793
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:43,700
There is nothing that I can do to you,
so the least you can do is just hear me out.

794
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:44,900
What?

795
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:48,600
You have to believe me.

796
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:52,100
You have to trust me.

797
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:55,800
Give me one good reason
why I should do that.

798
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,100
Because...

799
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:06,800
Because I love your friend Bryce
very, very much.

800
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:14,100
You do?

801
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:16,000
Yeah.

802
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:19,300
And have you told him that?

803
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:24,100
No.

804
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:26,800
No.

805
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:37,300
But I promise you, if we get out of this,
I promise you I will.

806
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:42,400
I don't care what happens to me right now.

807
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:47,000
But I care very much
about what happens to Bryce.

808
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:49,700
Bryce.

809
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:55,300
We just call him by his last name.
All his friends do.

810
01:21:56,700 --> 01:22:02,300
Yeah, I know, but I think he's got
a pretty nice first name, too.

811
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:11,900
Amber, if he's with Eve, if Kim's with Eve,

812
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
they're both in a lot of danger right now.

813
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,200
Are you still there?

814
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:06,600
What do you want me to do?

815
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:10,000
You need to go into Eve's room.

816
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:12,100
Why?

817
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:17,500
When I saw Eve in the woods with Matt,
her clothes were covered in blood.

818
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:21,300
She chased me back to the house.
I thought she was right behind me.

819
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:24,400
She must have climbed through her window
and changed her clothes.

820
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,900
She was the last one
to leave her room, remember?

821
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:30,000
-Yeah.
-I don't know how she did it. I just...

822
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:32,700
I know her other clothes
have still got to be in there.

823
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:36,500
I bet if you went into her room right now,
you'd find them.

824
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,400
Qkay.

825
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,500
I'm gonna go, but I'm not letting you out.

826
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:50,100
That's fine.

827
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,600
Amber!

828
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,800
Amber, honey!

829
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:47,300
Baker!

830
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:50,900
Baker!

831
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Babe!

832
01:25:58,500 --> 01:25:59,700
Amber!

833
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:08,100
Babe, I'm in the shed!

834
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:19,600
Qh, my God.

835
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:25,400
-Babe.
-Qh, my God.

836
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,700
-You should see the other guy.
-Qh, God. Baby.

837
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,500
Who did this to you?

838
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,500
Baker and Kim. They got taken.
They went crazy, and they got Eve, and...

839
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:38,700
Qh, God.

840
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:41,900
Eve's in a lot of trouble, baby.
We've gotta help Eve.

841
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:46,200
There's cutters. There's something sharp
on that bench right there.

842
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:51,600
God, that was horrible.

843
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,100
What?

844
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,600
-Why did they tie you up?
-What?

845
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:09,400
Come on, baby! They're gonna be here
any minute, and they're gonna get us, too.

846
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:10,500
Come on.

847
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:14,700
-No.
-Am.

848
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:20,300
No, you're like Matt was.

849
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:24,900
Am, I'm not like Matt was. Look at me, okay?
Look at me.

850
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:29,900
I'm the same guy that used to copy off you
in third period physics.

851
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:35,100
I got you that necklace,
the one you're wearing right now.

852
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:39,600
I gave it to you inside that tape case.
Remember tapes?

853
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:42,900
That was so long ago.

854
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:46,800
Come on, you know it's me. You just...
You just need some convincing, that's it.

855
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:49,200
Qh, my God. Qh, my God. Lily was right.

856
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:53,900
Lily! That lying bitch is trying
to tear us apart and you fucking know it!

857
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:56,500
Huh? Amber, come here!

858
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,200
Amber! Amber! Amber!

859
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:04,100
This is exactly why he cheated on you
all those years.

860
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:08,100
You think he stopped
when you guys got married? Wake up!

861
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:12,100
Last week was some little slut
who came into the bar, in the bathroom.

862
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:15,600
Fucked her over the shitter.
And you know why?

863
01:28:15,700 --> 01:28:18,300
Because you're so goddamn weak!

864
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:22,200
That's it. Walk away!

865
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:27,500
You think it was fun for old Dash,
living with a doormat?

866
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,600
Maybe if you actually acted pissed off

867
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:33,600
and maybe laid down a few ultimatums
once in a while,

868
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:36,200
it would have made a difference.

869
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:40,200
Amber! Are you listening to me?

870
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:47,300
Come on! You think it's fun
always being on top in the relationship?

871
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:53,000
It's boring! Men, they want a little misery!

872
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:57,100
They want to punch through walls,
bring out a little blood!

873
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:02,300
They wanna get that old reptile
part of the brain electrified once in a while!

874
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:03,800
They want...

875
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:13,700
Baby, I didn't mean any of that.
I didn't mean any...

876
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:35,000
What, are you gonna burn me alive
while you cry about it?

877
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:47,600
I hope you and Baker
are really happy, honey.

878
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:01,200
I hope you and Baker
have a real good life together,

879
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:05,700
right up untiI the point where you get
your fucking heads chewed off!

880
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:12,500
Yeah, fucking light it! Come on!
Nobody is getting out of here alive!

881
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:17,300
And you better believe me, baby,

882
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:21,500
that what is coming is going to hurt
worse than anything.

883
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:25,000
And I mean anything.

884
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:30,000
And you know what the best part is, Amber?

885
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:35,800
The best part is you're finally gonna have
something real to cry about, honey.

886
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:43,100
And I just can't fucking wait!

887
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:53,300
Qh, yeah? You don't have it in you.

888
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,300
Lily! Lily!

889
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:32,400
Lily! Lily!

890
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,800
Let me in! I'm not one of them!

891
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:41,300
Lily, let me in, baby! I'm not one of them!
I'm not one of them!

892
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:44,900
Where's Eve?

893
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:50,300
She attacked us. She's dead.

894
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:52,800
Kim?

895
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:57,300
I don't know. I lost her in the woods.

896
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,700
Did Eve bite you?

897
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:13,400
Baby, just let me in so I can see you!

898
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:15,900
You know I can't do that.

899
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:21,900
I know it.

900
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:25,600
Good girl.

901
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:31,000
Bryce...

902
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:35,300
I love you.

903
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,800
Who knows? Maybe it's not so bad.

904
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:47,700
How do we know?

905
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:51,100
Maybe we shouldn't be fighting it.

906
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:20,400
Please,

907
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:23,000
don't.

908
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:28,700
Don't.

909
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:53,700
Lily?

910
01:34:56,500 --> 01:35:00,000
-Qpen the door and let me in.
-No way.

911
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
I could come in a window.

912
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:05,900
You could try.

913
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:21,500
Who lit that fire?

914
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,700
-Amber.
-ls she in there with you?

915
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:29,500
She never came back.

916
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:39,500
So, I guess it's just you and me.

917
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:45,200
It's gonna be a long night.

918
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:17,600
-What is it?
-Eve's back.

919
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,100
Haven't burned him yet?

920
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,200
Not yet.

921
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:14,400
I thought I smelled gas.

922
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:18,300
Three cars worth.

923
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:29,200
What are you gonna do if you find out
you're the only two left?

924
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:31,300
Well...

925
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:36,700
It's been a long weekend already.

926
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:44,500
Kim, I fucked Matt.

927
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:55,000
Eve, we broke up.
