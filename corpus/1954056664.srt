Hmm... Mrs. Crosby.

00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,629
- Hello, Coco.
- Good morning.

27
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,631
- Good morning, Mrs. Harper.
- Hi, Andrei.

28
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:41,633
Your husband was
out of here early.

29
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:44,970
- Hmm. Such is the life of a surgeon.
- Yes, indeed.

30
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:47,439
- Bye-bye.

43
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:24,643
- Come on, Desiree!
- Whoo! Whoops!

44
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:28,646
You call that a punch?

45
00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:31,149
You're hitting
like a girlie girl.

Come on!

00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:35,620
Neutralize your opponent!

48
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:37,489
Oh!

49
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,526
Oh. Sorry.

50
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:43,529
I love it.

51
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:47,031
Lunch at one?

52
00:02:47,032 --> 00:02:49,034
Absolutely!

53
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:10,021
Cheers.

54
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:11,523
So, Lana,

55
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:13,525
tell us about Rudolpho.

56
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,528
Mm. It's Renaldo.

57
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,730
And I just found out he has a wife
and three kids back in Argentina.

58
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:22,734
Who cares as long as his family
stays over there, right?

59
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,669
I'd care.

60
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,071
Oh, my gosh, it's Dr. Fisher,
best surgeon in town.

61
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:28,072
Ah!

62
00:03:28,073 --> 00:03:31,376
Dr. Fisher! Hi!
Cheers.

63
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,879
Bye-bye.

64
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
Oh, Mrs. Harper!

65
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:37,382
- Let me get your bag.
- Thank you, Andrei.

66
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,384
Oh, they're heavy.
How are you?

67
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,887
Ah, you should see the summer
collection at Coccinelle.

68
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:44,890
Really. I can't wait.

69
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:52,230
Mm, blinis and caviar for me.

70
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:55,734
Hummus and carrots for him.

71
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:04,944
Dr. Harper's office.

72
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:06,945
- Hi, Linda.
- Hi, Desiree.

73
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:09,447
So is my husband
on his way home?

74
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:11,449
Uh, didn't he text you?

75
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,952
No, no, no,
I didn't get his text.

76
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,454
He had a last-minute
surgery.

77
00:04:16,455 --> 00:04:18,456
He has a last-minute surgery?

78
00:04:18,457 --> 00:04:20,459
- It was a bunion flare-up.
- Tonight?

79
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,461
Yes, tonight. Would you
like me to leave a message?

80
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:28,967
Oh. Uh, no, no, um...
no message.

81
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,468
All right.

82
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:31,470
Thanks.

83
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:41,980
Happy Anniversary, Wade.

84
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:03,335
You all right?

85
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,039
Do I look all right?

86
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,321
You know, Desiree,
you shouldn't consume so much dairy.

87
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:25,157
Oh, really, Doctor?

88
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:27,592
Who spiked your prune juice?

89
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:30,495
Well, let me see.

90
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,997
Maybe it's the Cristal
that I had,

91
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:36,434
by myself, on our anniversary.

92
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:38,837
Our anniversary?

93
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,341
How could you forget?

94
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,849
Desiree...

95
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:53,852
I'm leaving you.

96
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:57,389
What?

97
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:01,359
I'm in love
with my acupuncturist.

98
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,195
You've been getting
acupuncture?

99
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:05,563
- Yes.
- But...

100
00:06:05,564 --> 00:06:07,565
you hate pain.

101
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:09,567
It isn't really painful.

102
00:06:09,568 --> 00:06:11,970
It's quite relaxing, actually.
She's very gentle.

103
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,906
I don't care if she puts you
into a tantric coma!

104
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:16,308
I meant to tell you sooner.

105
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,878
- Sooner?
- We've been seeing each other for eight months.

106
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,815
Well, that's very sneaky of you.

107
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,251
What's her name?

108
00:06:27,753 --> 00:06:28,754
Olive.

109
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:34,759
Olive. Like...
the cocktail condiment?

110
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,063
How old is she?

111
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:41,566
I can see that you're not
taking this very well.

112
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,402
How old is she, Wade?

113
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,573
Twenty.

114
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:53,244
Just stop before things
get any worse!

115
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:56,247
"Worse?" How could
things get any worse?

116
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:59,751
Wade wants a divorce,
and you don't get a dime.

117
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,186
How is that possible?

118
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:04,122
It's possible because you,

119
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,591
against my vehement protests,
signed a pre-nup,

120
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:10,595
which is the nastiest,
most malignant piece of one-sided schlock

121
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,097
ever been drafted
on the island of Manhattan.

122
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:16,100
Thank you, Eddie.
That makes me feel so much better.

123
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:17,101
Anything else?

124
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:18,603
Well, yeah.

125
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,104
He's also filed
a restraining order against you.

126
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:22,107
- What?
- Apparently,

127
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,609
you turned into
some kind of crazed ninja

128
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,045
and tried to strangle him
over his Grape Nuts.

129
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,446
It was All Bran.

130
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:29,948
Who cares?
It's a nutty thing to do.

131
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:31,817
And I didn't strangle him.

132
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,286
Much.

133
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:37,789
I don't even know you
anymore, Desiree.

134
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,757
Whatever happened to that
sweet little Jersey girl

135
00:07:39,758 --> 00:07:42,794
that I kissed in the boys' bathroom
back at Flemville Elementary?

136
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:45,129
Oh, for goodness sakes, Eddie!

137
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,570
We were twelve! You're supposed
to be my lawyer. Do something!

138
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,802
I'm trying. Okay?
I'm in the process of negotiating

139
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,444
the retrieval of your personal
belongings from your former dwelling

140
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,808
in the presence
of a law enforcement officer.

141
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:57,809
"Former dwelling?"

142
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,145
Yeah. You gotta surrender
your keys to the penthouse.

143
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:02,647
What?

144
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:03,848
And the ring.

145
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,351
No!

146
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,964
Let go.

147
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:22,366
How am I supposed
to sustain myself?

148
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:26,838
Have you forgotten that your parents
practically hocked the family business

149
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,373
to send you to Columbia?

150
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:33,344
Maybe it's time
to dust off that MBA of yours.

151
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:36,347
Perfect. I can just hear
the interview now.

152
00:08:36,348 --> 00:08:38,850
"Oh, what kind of work
experience have you acquired

153
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,352
over the last 15 years
Mrs. Harper?"

154
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:45,357
"Well, none, but I am quite
an accomplished shopper."

155
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:46,591
You have a place to stay?

156
00:08:48,393 --> 00:08:50,294
Crash on my couch.

157
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,630
Thanks,

158
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:55,600
but my girlfriends
will be fighting over me.

159
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,034
- Morgan.
- What's going on?

160
00:08:57,035 --> 00:08:58,536
- You heard?
- Unbelievable.

161
00:08:58,537 --> 00:09:00,538
Oh, yes! Listen...

162
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:02,540
We were just leaving
for the country house.

163
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,042
You're going to the
Hamptons? That's perfect!

164
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:07,044
I can watch your penthouse
while you're gone.

165
00:09:07,045 --> 00:09:08,546
The building doesn't allow
strangers in the apartment.

166
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:11,048
But surely your husband
would trust me.

167
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:12,550
How's Wade's throat?

168
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:15,553
Oh. Uh, Wade's throat is fine.

169
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:18,055
So he's not pressing charges?

170
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:20,391
No, he's not pressing charges.

171
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:22,727
- Hi, Lana. You got my message?
- Uh-huh.

172
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,730
- So I can stay with you?
- No, honey, I'm with Fabio.

173
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,732
- Who's Fabio?
- You know, the one from Spain.

174
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:32,236
Oh. Well, that's no problem.
You won't even know I'm there.

175
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:33,738
He cooks in the nude.

176
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,240
Oh. That would be awkward.

177
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:38,743
Sasha? I'm desperate.

178
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,746
All I'm asking is to sleep
in your maid's room.

179
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,748
That's Fluffy's room.

180
00:09:43,248 --> 00:09:45,249
I don't care
if your cat's in there.

181
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,251
I love Fluffy.

182
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,472
He's so sensitive.

183
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,254
Any little change,
he stops eating.

184
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:53,257
Listen, missy. Who nursed you
through your last eye job?

185
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:54,759
I can't believe
you just said that!

186
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,260
Are you blackmailing me?

187
00:09:56,261 --> 00:10:00,264
No, I am not trying
to blackmail you! I would never!

188
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:02,767
- Well, it sounded like it to me.
- Oh, come...

189
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:07,605
Hello? Hello?

190
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:09,307
Out of the road! Get back!

191
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:12,476
Watch it! Ohh!

192
00:10:12,477 --> 00:10:13,444
Oh!

193
00:10:13,812 --> 00:10:15,112
Ah!

194
00:10:15,113 --> 00:10:15,613
Oh!

195
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,104
May I help you?

196
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:41,973
I'd like a room, please.

197
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,308
Do you have a reservation?

198
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:47,178
No, this is
an involuntary visit.

199
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,680
I'm afraid we're sold out.

200
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:54,185
Can you...
Can you please...

201
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,654
Can you please check?
Just in case.

202
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:59,190
All right, but I'm
absolutely certain.

203
00:10:59,691 --> 00:11:01,192
Please.

204
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,595
Ah! Mr. Pitbull
just canceled.

205
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:07,999
- Oh!
- So the Imperial Suite is available

206
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,403
at $3,250... per night.

207
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:15,840
Sold! Oh, you have no idea
what a horrible day I've had.

208
00:11:16,174 --> 00:11:18,543
What I need is
a new pair of shoes,

209
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:22,146
a hot bath,
and a Porterhouse steak.

210
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:26,551
I'm terribly sorry.
Your card has been declined.

211
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,185
That's impossible.

212
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:32,523
It has no credit limit.
Please, try again.

213
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:43,234
Oh. Yes, right away.

214
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,071
W-What are you doing?

215
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:51,575
I have been instructed
to destroy your card.

216
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:54,078
You know, good luck.
It's made out of titanium.

217
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:02,720
I don't suppose
you'd comp me a room.

218
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,722
No!

219
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:08,226
I didn't think so.
How 'bout your place?

220
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,732
Hey!

221
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:18,737
I was joking!
He's not even my type!

222
00:12:19,237 --> 00:12:22,907
I am calling the credit card
complaint department.

223
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:26,945
You are all in big trouble!

224
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,892
Oh, no.

225
00:12:42,961 --> 00:12:44,962
Daddy.

226
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:49,867
I'm so happy to see you.
It's been a long time.

227
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,440
I forgot to pay
that nice cab driver.

228
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,444
Don't worry about that. He hit you.
I don't think they charge for that.

229
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:03,582
I remember.
I was making a call.

230
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,152
Did you see my phone?

231
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,154
I don't think it made it.

232
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:13,157
But I can't live without it.

233
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:17,262
You'd be amazed
at what we can live without.

234
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,832
You may get sleepy, darling.

235
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:25,103
The doctor gave you
an anti-anxiety agent.

236
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:28,674
Really?
I'm feeling quite alert.

237
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,182
You go ahead and rest,
sweetheart.

238
00:13:38,183 --> 00:13:40,485
You'll be as good
as new tomorrow.

239
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,990
I'm so happy you're home.

240
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,094
I missed you.

241
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,026
Breakfast is ready!

242
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,046
Oh... Oh!

243
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,553
Ah!

244
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,723
Daddy?

245
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:15,279
- Daddy!
- Good morning, sweetheart.

246
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,281
How you feeling?

247
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:20,284
A little stiff,
but okay, I guess.

248
00:15:20,285 --> 00:15:22,787
Sit, sit, sit, sit.
There you go.

249
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,297
What's wrong?

250
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:38,369
You made me pancakes
and Jimmy Dean sausages!

251
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,937
That's your favorite.

252
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:43,207
This breakfast
is five zillion calories!

253
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,776
Well, don't you want it?

254
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,780
No, I do.
That's the problem.

255
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,550
Daddy, I have
something to tell you.

256
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:56,121
I know.
Eddie told me about Dick.

257
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,789
It's not Dick. That was
my college boyfriend.

258
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,292
My husband's name
is Wade, remember?

259
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,793
Well, whatever.

260
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:05,296
If your mother
was still alive...

261
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,332
God rest her soul...

262
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,969
there's no telling what
she would've called him.

263
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,973
I don't understand why
Wade would do this to me.

264
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:16,975
I was a good wife.

265
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,976
You warned me not to marry him,

266
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:20,578
but now look at me.

267
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,647
Now I'm just a discarded woman,

268
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,650
like somebody's
disposable razor!

269
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,084
Here, drink some juice.

270
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:28,152
Why aren't you listening to me?

271
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,088
I am, I am. I'm listening,
I'm listening.

272
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:33,157
I'm letting you vent.

273
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:37,595
Darling, everything's
gonna be all right. Believe me.

274
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,664
How am I going
to support myself?

275
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,799
I don't even have a skill.

276
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,336
You have a perfectly good skill.

277
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,604
Baking.

278
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,510
There you are.
Make you feel better.

279
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,512
Making bread?

280
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,014
It's not just bread.

281
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,016
- It's the staff of life.
- Of life.

282
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,020
I'm sorry
I'm late, Mr. P.

283
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:05,857
My mother, she had a...
Oh. Hello.

284
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,793
- Dino, this is my daughter.
- Hi.

285
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,362
Desiree.

286
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,797
Dino Ravettino.

287
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:17,535
Boy, Paddy talks a lot
about you. All good.

288
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,538
Hey, Mr. P,
I'm thinking about trying out a new coffee.

289
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,039
It's called
"cinnamon swirl."

290
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,041
It sounds good.

291
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,010
I'll brew some up.
Nice to meet you.

292
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,547
You, too.

293
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:30,548
- He's new.
- He's big.

294
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,051
But surprisingly nimble
in the kitchen.

295
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:43,628
- Good morning.
- Hey, Moe.

296
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,906
Good morning, Francine.

297
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:57,074
Morning, Paddy.

298
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:06,484
Hey, Moe!
How does it go?

299
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,986
Morning, Paddy.

300
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:34,044
- Hi, Edna.
- Paddy, I'm so glad you finally hired some help.

301
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:35,046
Oh.

302
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:38,048
Did she just call me the help?

303
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:40,551
This is Desiree, my daughter.

304
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:45,356
Oh. The one who married
that famous, rich doctor from Manhattan?

305
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:48,860
How about a loaf
of Irish soda bread?

306
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,362
- It's hot out of the oven.
- Okay, sure.

307
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:54,865
Hey, boss, I got an order
ready for delivery.

308
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:55,966
Is Reggie here yet?

309
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:58,002
No, he's not here yet.

310
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:01,572
- Oh.
- I read about your husband in OK Magazine.

311
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:05,576
Did he really do
Britney Spears' surgery?

312
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:06,577
Excuse me?

313
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,679
Her toe tuck.

314
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,347
- No.
- Her husband

315
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:13,417
is the cosmetic foot doctor
to the stars.

316
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,486
He specializes
in toe-besity.

317
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:19,023
So, when's he coming
to Flemington so we can meet him?

318
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:21,592
Never.
He dumped her.

319
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:22,526
Uh, sorry.

320
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:23,594
Dad!

321
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:29,600
Can I help you?

322
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,202
My name's Calvin.
I'm Reggie's brother.

323
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,571
- Where's Reggie?
- He's at jury duty.

324
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,573
He sent me to make
his deliveries for him.

325
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:36,874
Fine. Where's your car?

326
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,912
Man, I don't have one.
I'm only fifteen.

327
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:42,714
Oh, shoot.

328
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:47,284
- Watch the head.
- Doh!

329
00:19:47,285 --> 00:19:49,287
- All right, you in?
- Dino's in.

330
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:54,091
Nope!
He's not in, Dad.

331
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:55,626
Oh...

332
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,127
Is Francine okay with this?

333
00:19:57,128 --> 00:19:59,129
- She's fine.
- Looks a little tight.

334
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,731
I don't want to break
her steering wheel.

335
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:03,801
All right.
Dino out.

336
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,906
- Oh! Ow...
- Oh!

337
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,474
All right, easy, now.

338
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:11,976
Desiree in.

339
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:13,478
- What?
- You're in.

340
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,980
No, I'm from Manhattan.
We don't drive.

341
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,982
Of course you do.
I taught you.

342
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,484
Well, that was two decades ago.

343
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,052
Well, you're all we've got.

344
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:26,123
I'm too old, he's too big,
and he's too young.

345
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,425
Please.

346
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,464
Look, it's just like
riding a bicycle.

347
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:36,968
You get a few blocks, and
it all comes back to you.

348
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:40,972
Uh, the brake's in the middle.

349
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,474
Go.

350
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:46,510
Okay. I can do this.

351
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,012
I can do this.

352
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,580
Okay, I can do this.

353
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,149
You're doin' great, honey! Keep it up!

354
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,519
- You're beautiful!
- Go! Go, go!

355
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,523

356
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,991
Yeah. Just like
her mother.

357
00:21:00,992 --> 00:21:03,527

A piece of paradise

00:22:31,082 --> 00:22:32,082
Hey.

372
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,418

Hi there.

378
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,992
Hi.

379
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,226
You saw that, didn't you?

380
00:23:16,227 --> 00:23:17,294
Yep.

381
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:26,804
- I, uh-I should probably tell somebody. Right?
- Nah.

382
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:28,806
No?

383
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,309
I don't know.
Do birds really need two stories?

384
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:36,648
Oh...

385
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:39,150
Well, uh...

386
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:41,085
Hate to hit and run, but, uh,

387
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,153
do you know where I
can leave this bread?

388
00:23:43,154 --> 00:23:45,656
- I'll take it.
- Oh, great.

389
00:23:53,164 --> 00:23:54,165
Here.

390
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:56,667
Okay.

391
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,669
I got it. Thanks.

392
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,172
Okay. Thanks.

393
00:24:02,173 --> 00:24:03,674
Well.

394
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:07,177
So you're the new
delivery girl?

395
00:24:07,178 --> 00:24:11,181
No, no, I am not
the new delivery girl.

396
00:24:11,182 --> 00:24:12,683
I'm, uh-I...

397
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:16,186
Never mind.

398
00:24:16,187 --> 00:24:20,691
Okay. I will let you
get back to your gardening.

399
00:24:24,562 --> 00:24:26,063
Sorry.

400
00:24:27,565 --> 00:24:29,566
I'll take those, boss.

401
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:31,068
Thank you.

402
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:01,098
Hi.

403
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:02,099
Hello.

404
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,102
- You must be Francine.
- Desiree!

405
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:06,603
I feel like I know you already.

406
00:25:06,604 --> 00:25:08,105
Hi.

407
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,607
Paddy must be thrilled
to have you home.

408
00:25:10,608 --> 00:25:12,176
Yeah.

409
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,011
But you're not?

410
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:17,881
Oh, I just wish home
wasn't in New Jersey.

411
00:25:17,882 --> 00:25:19,950
Oh. Well...

412
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,886
I suppose Flemington is a little
different than what you're used to.

413
00:25:22,887 --> 00:25:24,454
Just a little.

414
00:25:24,455 --> 00:25:26,723
Oh, I brought you your keys.

415
00:25:26,724 --> 00:25:28,792
Thank you for letting us
use your car.

416
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,260
You're welcome. Anytime.

417
00:25:30,261 --> 00:25:32,796
Okay. So...

418
00:25:38,102 --> 00:25:38,902
How's it going, Calvin?

419
00:25:38,903 --> 00:25:40,437
It's going a'ight. Thanks.

420
00:25:45,476 --> 00:25:46,977
I love this game.

421
00:25:47,478 --> 00:25:48,479
I love it, I love it.

422
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,983
Oh, hey, Desiree.
Nice to see you.

423
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:55,219
Thanks, Moe.

424
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,920
I see you got back alive.

425
00:25:56,921 --> 00:25:59,923
Yeah, but I think I might have
killed the Mini Cooper.

426
00:25:59,924 --> 00:26:01,491
Uh-oh.

427
00:26:01,492 --> 00:26:03,494
Mr. P, Francine
would forgive you anything,

428
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:04,928
if you know what I mean.

429
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:06,763
Huh. What's he
talking about?

430
00:26:06,764 --> 00:26:08,332
Uh, nothing!

431
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,068
Big mouth.

432
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,403
- Sorry, boss.
- Hit me.

433
00:26:13,404 --> 00:26:16,106
So who's minding
the store, guys?

434
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,608
Why? Do we have a customer?

435
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,610
- No.
- Hey.

436
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:22,613
Eddie called.
Sounded important.

437
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,449
Okay.

438
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,018
Full house!

439
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:30,020
- Full house.
- Oh...

440
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:33,758
You owe me two haircuts,
and you owe me spaghetti.

441
00:26:34,325 --> 00:26:35,926
I'm gonna get you next time.

442
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:38,495
So, does that work for you two?

443
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,497
- Eddie, that works for me.
- Great.

444
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,800
Okay. I'll get the papers
over to your office.

445
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:44,134
- Dougie.
- Good to see you.

446
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:46,637
- Marina.
- Ah. Thank you.

447
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,138
- See you soon.
- Come on, honey.

448
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:49,039
Eddie Rubinsky.

449
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:50,474
Eddie!

450
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:52,476
Were you trying to reach me?

451
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:55,178
Desiree, I got good news.

452
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:58,181
Oh. I can move back
into my penthouse?

453
00:26:58,182 --> 00:26:59,249
No.

454
00:26:59,817 --> 00:27:03,320
Help me, Eddie.
I can't live here.

455
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:04,821
Okay, well, listen.

456
00:27:04,822 --> 00:27:06,823
I talked Wade into dropping
the restraining order,

457
00:27:06,824 --> 00:27:09,326
and they've scheduled
a meeting with you tomorrow

458
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:10,327
at his lawyer's office.

459
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,329
With me?

460
00:27:11,829 --> 00:27:13,330
Oh, that's good.

461
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:15,332
That's-I mean...
That's good, right?

462
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,368
Yeah. If you manage to control yourself,

463
00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:19,536
you'll get your clothes back.

464
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:23,041
Aha! Hallelujah!

465
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,044
Eddie, I gotta call you back.

466
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,547
Yeah, but, De-

467
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,188
Hi, Calvin.

468
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:38,690
Hey.

469
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:43,394
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, this drawer just sprung

470
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,395
when I was trying
to clean up and all.

471
00:27:45,396 --> 00:27:47,397
- It just popped open.
- Well, that's not good.

472
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:49,967
No, ma'am, it's not.

473
00:27:52,036 --> 00:27:54,538
You worked hard here today.
The place looks nice.

474
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,040
Thanks.

475
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,543
Is your brother gonna be
coming back tomorrow?

476
00:28:00,044 --> 00:28:01,311
Nah.

477
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:03,580
I'm sorry to hear that.

478
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:07,084
Yeah. Do you think maybe Paddy
would let me fill in for him?

479
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:09,853
I can make deliveries before
school and come back at 3:00.

480
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,889
I could do that for y'all,
if you want.

481
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,392
Plus, m-m-my family
could really use the money.

482
00:28:16,894 --> 00:28:18,895
I think my dad
would be okay with that.

483
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:20,897
Yeah? Thanks.

484
00:28:20,898 --> 00:28:22,399
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

485
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,403
- Later, Mr. P.
- Good night, Calvin.

486
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:29,906
Hey, Dad, about Calvin...

487
00:28:29,907 --> 00:28:33,410
- Oh, yeah, he's a good kid, isn't he?
- Yeah, I like him.

488
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:35,412
Whoa!

489
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:38,248
Paddy,
we gotta call that guy to fix the register.

490
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:39,216
It's popping open again.

491
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:42,786
Desiree, he lost the last hand,

492
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:44,622
so Dino has to cook dinner.

493
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,925
You're in luck. You know
I make a mean meatball. Hmm?

494
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,927
Oh, yeah, I know.

495
00:28:50,928 --> 00:28:52,929
What game's playing?

496
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:55,432
The Sox. The Red Sox and the Yankees.

497
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:57,434
- You got a bet on 'em?
- No betting.

498
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:59,437
I already owe you a spaghetti.

499
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,939
Oh, it's hit deep to center!

00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,841

- Morning.

504
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:40,111
I just killed my blow dryer.

505
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:41,479

506
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:43,513

to straighten my hair?

Have you seen the dress
I was wearing when I got here?

508
00:29:45,516 --> 00:29:47,518
I washed it for you.

hot out of the dryer.

510
00:29:49,987 --> 00:29:52,522
- The dryer?
- Yeah.

511
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:57,594

00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:59,863

wet it, you know, and stretch it back out.

♪ But I'll promise
I'll never look up ♪

534
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:05,629
- Desiree?
- Ohh...

535
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,131
Lana.

536
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:12,135
Wow. I almost
didn't recognize you.

537
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:13,036
What happened?

538
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,839
Retro.

539
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:19,143
Okay. Well, can I just say
the '80s have come and gone.

540
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,111
Twice.

541
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:23,113
I was just in a meeting
with my business manager,

542
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:25,116
and he was telling me
all this drama.

543
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:28,286
Is it true? You and Wade
are really getting divorced?

544
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:31,288
I don't know.
It's a nightmare.

545
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:32,790
- I could use a lunch with the girls.
- Sure, honey.

546
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,292
Where are you staying?
The St. Regis?

547
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:36,127
New Jersey.

548
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:37,494
What?

549
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:40,998
I had nowhere else to go.

550
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,000
Remember?

551
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,502
Oh, yeah. This whole situation
has gotten really tricky,

552
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:47,504
'cause Wade and I run
in the same social circles,

553
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:49,506
and he's a member
of my country club and, you know,

554
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,508
but it's like
I've really got to run

555
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,510
'cause I'm late
for my, uh, my facial.

556
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:55,012
So, bye.

557
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:57,015
So, lunch this weekend?

558
00:31:57,448 --> 00:32:00,017
Sure. Yeah.
We'll call you.

559
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:01,519
Bye.

560
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:17,534
Hi. How can I help you?

561
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:19,003
Desiree?

562
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,007
Oh. Hi, Wade.

563
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:26,343
You look... different.
Are you all right?

564
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,179
Sort of.

565
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,183
I've regained my sanity
since the last time I saw you.

566
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,118
Oh.

567
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,019
Sorry about the tie grabbing.

568
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:40,357
No. It was
completely my fault.

569
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:43,860
Actually, I'm really pleased that we
had a chance to meet before we go in.

570
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:48,365
I just wanted to tell you
how sorry I am and that I really hope-

571
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:49,866
Wade.

572
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:53,370
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Saul Blinderman.

573
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,372
This is my junior associate,
Nicole Hoffman.

574
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:56,707
This way, please.

575
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,042
Uh, but my lawyer
isn't here yet.

576
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:01,045
The receptionist will show him in.

577
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:07,384
This meeting should be brief since there
is a clear-cut prenuptial agreement

578
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:10,588
which was signed
willingly by both-

579
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:12,423
I'm sorry I'm late.

580
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:16,927
Ah.

581
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,429
Eddie, are you okay?

582
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,170
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

583
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:21,951
I had a little
cracked tooth back here.

584
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,720
The dentist gave me
a little something.

585
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,904
I feel much better now.
You change your hair?

586
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:29,740
Mr. Rubinsky,
may we continue, please?

587
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:32,709
Yeah, sure.
Go ahead.

588
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,245
The prenuptial agreement
clearly states

589
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:39,116
that Mrs. Harper is only entitled to the
monetary sum and personal belongings

590
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:41,418
that she entered
into the marriage with.

591
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:45,956
But it precludes the creation of any
community property after the marriage began-

592
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:48,625
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Bla bla bla.

593
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,293
Excuse me?

594
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:52,295
Eddie...

595
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:54,297
Get it together.

596
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:57,601
We need to reschedule this
for another time.

597
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,603
That doesn't work for us.

598
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:02,105
Mr. Harper would like
to conclude this as quickly as possible.

599
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:04,107
I don't understand.

600
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:05,609
What's the big rush?

601
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:08,946
Olive is pregnant.

602
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,784
That was exhilarating!

603
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,788
Exhilarating?
Are you cracked?

604
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:20,290
My husband is pregnant
with another woman!

605
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:23,794
Hi. That's right!
Yeah, it's bad.

606
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:26,663
But it's good for you
in a whole new monetary way.

607
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:29,166
- Are you kidding?
- Oh! What? What?

608
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:33,171
Desi, hey! Desi!
What's the problem?

609
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,715
Oh, Giorgio!

610
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,217
Jimmy!

611
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,221
Louis. Oh!

612
00:34:56,561 --> 00:35:00,464
I hate to break it to you,
but we're moving to Jersey.

613
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:02,533
Damn!

614
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,372
Hmph!

615
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,373
What?

616
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:11,875
Nothin'.

617
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:14,878
Those are cute, that's all.

618
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,383
They are, aren't they?

619
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,391
Vvvvv!

620
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,326
Vvvvv!

621
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,495
Sir, please don't touch that.

622
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:35,565
I'm not touching it.
That's what's so incomprehensible.

623
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:38,068
See? Vvvvv!

624
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,571
- Vvvvv!
- Step away from the planet, sir!

625
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,873
Vvvvv!

626
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,447
It's a little snug.

627
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,449
Oh, trust me, Tamika,

628
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,452
once you lose the bulletproof
vest and let out that side seam,

629
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:56,953
it's fabulous.

630
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:58,021
You think so?

631
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:03,593
Are you sure?

632
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:05,596
It never fit me right, anyway.

633
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:11,101
Now for the shoes.

634
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,105
Don't sit.

635
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,311
Don't touch!

636
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,054
Can I look?

637
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,333
Eddie?

638
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:44,335
Yeah?

639
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:47,837
- You okay?
- Yeah.

640
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:49,773
I'm going.

641
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,342
Me, too.

642
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:54,945
Oh, Officer,

643
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:57,848
if you ever need a lawyer,
please, call me.

644
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:01,352
Wow.

645
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,828
It's time to go, ma'am.

646
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,546
Bye. Thank you.

647
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,218
You are gonna be fine.

648
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:36,720
Yeah?

649
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,616
This is your life.

650
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,120
Get used to it.

651
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,299
Hmm.

652
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,304
Miss you, Mom.

653
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:07,745
Let's bake.

654
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:16,287
Dad's right. Baking does
make you feel better.

655
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:03,933
Holy moley!
It's the Bride of Chucky.

656
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:06,503
Uh! This isn't working!

657
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,506
I am not a baker!

658
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:12,976
My housekeeper buys
my bread at Zabar's!

659
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:22,486
Whoa.
Would you look at that.

660
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:28,512
Good morning.

661
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:29,759
Morning!

662
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,827
Morning, Calvin.

663
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:33,830
I got wheels, Mr. P.
I'm ready to roll.

664
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:35,265
Ho!

665
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,434
We saw. Very pink.

666
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,002
That's my sister's, man!

667
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,069
I want the fruity one.

668
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,638
I pointed to it first.

669
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,106
Where's Desiree?

670
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,240
Changing.

671
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:45,809
For three hours?

672
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,812
Man, I need a spa day.

673
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:50,815
How you feeling?

674
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:52,282
Just fine.

675
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,852
Can you wrap these cannolis?

676
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:57,855
It's what I live for, Dino.

677
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,691
There she is.

678
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:04,093
- The one that left her husband?
- No!

679
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:05,662
He left her.

680
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:07,664
He's a successful doctor.

681
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:11,035
What a shame. She looks
like such a nice girl.

682
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:13,336
It's gonna be tough
for a woman her age

683
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:16,339
to find a new husband
with that kind of annual income.

684
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,841
Practically impossible.

685
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,343
I can hear you.

686
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:23,847
Maybe she should go
on the Internet.

687
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:26,717
My cousin's daughter
found a nice rabbi on there.

688
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:30,119
She'd be better off
in a bar. Mm-hmm.

689
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,690
Well, if I were her,
I'd get on my hands and knees

690
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:37,294
and beg that handsome doctor
to please take her back.

691
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,330
That's it!

692
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,399
I am not going anywhere.
You hear me?

693
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,069
Not to a bar,
not on the Internet,

694
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,571
and, heaven forbid,
not on my knees

695
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:52,075
to beg my sneaky, cheating
husband to take me back.

696
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:54,711
So in case any of you
missed the story of my life,

697
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:59,148
yes, my husband is having a baby
with his acupuncturist.

698
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:02,886
No, I don't need a man
for his annual income,

699
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,888
and maybe, if God has any mercy,

700
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:07,858
you will all get over it
and find something else to talk about!

701
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:10,860
I think she lost it.

702
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,930
Uh... who's next?

703
00:42:15,632 --> 00:42:17,700
Me?

704
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,235
What would you like?

705
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,624
That was certainly different.

706
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:45,628
You just managed to insult half of Paddy's
best customers in one fell swoop.

707
00:42:45,629 --> 00:42:47,130
- Well, they deserved it.
- Oh, maybe,

708
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,632
but your father didn't.

709
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:52,635
You know how happy he is
to have you home now?

710
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:55,304
He's really missed you.

711
00:42:55,305 --> 00:42:58,274
I know.
I've missed him, too.

712
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:02,912
I tried to get back to visit.

713
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,481
It's been five years.

714
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,483
You can't have tried very hard.

715
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:11,521
But no matter.
Paddy would give you the world if he could.

716
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:15,525
And despite
their misguided ways,

717
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:18,529
those people in there
just wanted to help you, too.

718
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,531
It's what folk do around here.

719
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:23,000
They help each other.

720
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:26,536
And instead of being grateful,

721
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:29,472
you strut around with
your Fifth Avenue attitude

722
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:32,542
and your lousy work ethic.

723
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:38,514
If you just looked around
you might realize

724
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:41,784
that Paddy can't even afford
the job he's given you.

725
00:43:43,353 --> 00:43:46,289
What?
I had no idea.

726
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,860
Because you didn't
bother asking.

727
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:11,948
Dad?

728
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,482
Yeah?

729
00:44:13,483 --> 00:44:14,817
How are things going here?

730
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,620
Oh, fine. Why?

731
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,991
I was just going over
your numbers, and-

732
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,493
Here, try that.

733
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:26,863
- Huh.
- Mm!

734
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,331
Um...

735
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,832
It's not looking good.

736
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,834
You do a decent business
in the morning,

737
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,836
but the rest of the day,
it's absolutely dead.

738
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:36,172
- What about that potato bread?
- It's delicious.

739
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,007
Needs a tad more sea salt.

740
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,442
- You think so?
- Yeah.

741
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,844
Oh, maybe, maybe a touch.

742
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:45,848
I'm talking about the future
of Paddy's Bakery here.

743
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:50,353
I keep tellin' him.
We need to modernize. Don't I, Mr. P?

744
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,121
I'm too old to be modern.

745
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:54,891
Maybe we could put a little
sitting area out front.

746
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:56,894
We could jazz up
the place a little bit.

747
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:59,396
We could offer
designer coffees.

748
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:02,058
My cousin's got a used
cappuccino machine he's selling.

749
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:03,480
I could get it for a steal.

750
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:05,401
- Perfect!
- What y'all need to do is get

751
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:07,904
some new tunes, man,
for us young people.

752
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:10,407
- Great idea.
- Whoa. Wait a minute.

753
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:13,376
I don't know about that.

754
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:16,379
Come on, Daddy.
I can make this work.

755
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,649
Let me show you what I learned at that
expensive university you paid for.

756
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:23,719
I promise you,
I won't steer you wrong.

757
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,056
Oh. Oh, well, maybe.

758
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,392
Well, all right.

759
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,727
Yes!

760
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:33,730
I got it.

761
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:36,599
- Yes!
- Yeah.

762
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,101
- Delicious.
- Ha ha! Whoo!

763
00:45:39,102 --> 00:45:43,106
Ow! Mm, one second.

764
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:45,608
Oh!

765
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:48,445
I broke a nail. I don't believe it!

766
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:53,884
You want me to call someone?

767
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:57,787
Oh. You again.

768
00:45:57,788 --> 00:45:59,288
Hi.

769
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:00,790
Hi.

770
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:03,293
We never formally met.
I'm Benny.

771
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:05,295
Benny.

772
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:09,299
As in Benoit's.

773
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:12,635
Oh, and you're the chef.

774
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:13,470
Yes.

775
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:14,971
And the owner?

776
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,973
Yeah.

777
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:20,476
Well, technically speaking,
the place belongs to my family.

778
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:23,480
My mother's French,
my father's English.

779
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:25,482
My mother's
eccentric great-uncle

780
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:28,485
decided to build a chateau
in the middle of New Jersey.

781
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:33,489
No one else in the family wanted to
restore it, but I did, so here I am.

782
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,224
In good old Flemington.

783
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:36,993
I take it you prefer Manhattan.

784
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:38,828
How do you know that?

785
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:40,664
Well, it's a small town.

786
00:46:42,165 --> 00:46:44,166
Can I get you something?

787
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:45,668
Uh, yeah, yeah.

788
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:49,673
I just came to, um,
settle my account for the month.

789
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,710
Hmm.

790
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,179
Would you like a receipt?

791
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,648
Yes, please.

792
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:12,662
That's a lot of baguettes.

793
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,967
What I'd really like
is your phone number.

794
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:19,869
What?

795
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:23,839
Oh, uh, hi, Benny.

796
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,842
Hi, Paddy.

797
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,379
So?

798
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,380
I don't have a number.

799
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:35,851
My phone was killed by a taxi
in front of a five-star hotel,

800
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:38,387
but even if I, if I...
if I did,

801
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:43,393
I am in a transitional state
and emotionally unavailable at this time.

802
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:47,897
Well, in that case,
I'll just take the receipt.

803
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:57,206
Au revoir.

804
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,082
Yeah, I don't even know
what that means.

805
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:11,587
You can come out now.

806
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:14,090
Yeah, well, we were just, uh...

807
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:15,592
Just keep walking.

808
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,094
- Let's go see what Moe's up to.
- Keep walking.

809
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:21,598
Yep, I'm walking. Walking.

810
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:22,958
Wait a minute.

811
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:27,363
Don't you have a good
Irish jig or something-

812
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:30,799
Oh. Little cakes! Hey.

813
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,802
- Want to taste?
- Oh, please.

814
00:49:33,803 --> 00:49:35,805
Wow. Mm.

815
00:49:36,806 --> 00:49:40,810
Mm. Whoa.
Oh, oh, that's good.

816
00:49:41,811 --> 00:49:43,312
I taste real vanilla bean.

817
00:49:43,813 --> 00:49:46,315
- Yep. My mother's recipe.
- Ah.

818
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,817
But a mini version.

819
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,319

That's a foofie cup.

872
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:26,975
I know. Coffee
just tastes better in a cup like this.

00:52:26,976 --> 00:52:28,844
Oh, good grief.

874
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:32,181
Hi.

875
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:34,683
Hi there.

876
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:36,185
Nice painting.

877
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:38,187
Thanks.
Nice, uh, nice tray.

878
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:40,189
Thanks.

879
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:41,690
So, how's everything
going at the bakery?

880
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:43,192
Great, great.

881
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:45,694
I hear you're
selling cappuccinos now.

882
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,696
Yeah.

883
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:50,199
And, um, something
called a paddycake?

884
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,201
Uh-huh.

885
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:54,704
I still can't call you, can I?

886
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:57,207
- No.
- I didn't think so.

887
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,611
Uh-oh.

888
00:53:03,546 --> 00:53:05,047
- Uh-oh.
- Paddy.

889
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:06,548
Give me a hand, would ya?

890
00:53:06,549 --> 00:53:08,484
- It's stuck.
- Oh, not again.

891
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,234
This joint is jumpin'!

892
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:27,736
You're gonna love it.
Really good.

893
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:30,706
Here you go. Tell me
how you like it. Okay?

894
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,108
It's all good stuff there.

895
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:35,878
Flavor of the day
is passion fruit. Few of those?

896
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,248
Must be the music.

897
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:54,096
Hey, Mr. Kerrigan.

898
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:55,164
Hi, Eddie.

899
00:53:56,633 --> 00:54:01,103
Desiree, I am really sorry about
botching the meeting with Wade.

900
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:02,238
Hmm.

901
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:11,180
Would you accept this free phone
that I got with my rollover minutes

902
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:13,182
as a peace offering?

903
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:16,685
Yes.

904
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:19,188
Thanks, Eddie.

905
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:22,192
- Of course I forgive you.
- Hey.

906
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:26,696
Hey, guys.
It's Friday night.

907
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:31,767
So what are we all doing, huh?

908
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,101
Come on, baby!

909
00:54:33,102 --> 00:54:34,169
Yes!

910
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:37,673
Whoohoo!

911
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:40,309
You still got it, Dad.

912
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,311
Go on, Eddie.
Give her a crack.

913
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:43,379
- Okay.
- Come on, Eddie.

914
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,682
Calvin, Hobbes,
watch and learn.

915
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:51,153
Oh. Oh!
Chicken cacciatore!

916
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:52,722
Oh!

917
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:55,724
Dad.

918
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:58,727
So how come you didn't
ask Francine to come out?

919
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:02,731
Francine? Uh, uh...

920
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:04,132
She's busy.

921
00:55:04,133 --> 00:55:06,168
Come on.

922
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:07,737
Well...

923
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:10,240
Sweetheart, I, uh...

924
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:14,009
I'm just not ready yet.

925
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:16,078
Sure you are.

926
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:18,580
You just don't know it.

927
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:22,985
At least try to go out
on one casual date.

928
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:34,062
Uh...

929
00:55:34,063 --> 00:55:36,899
Listen. Let me make
a deal with you, okay?

930
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:37,900
Okay.

931
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:39,868
I will if you will.

932
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:41,436
- Yeah?
- All right. You have a deal.

933
00:55:41,437 --> 00:55:44,439
Okay.

934
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:47,442
There's Benny.

935
00:55:47,443 --> 00:55:48,544
- Go on.
- Oh.

936
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:53,615
- No.
- Come on, now. A deal's a deal.

937
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:56,118
Go ahead. Go on!

938
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:03,125
Hi!

939
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:04,127
- Oh.
- Oh.

940
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:06,261
Sorry, I...
Sorry to startle you.

941
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:08,264
No, not at all.

942
00:56:09,265 --> 00:56:11,233
It's nice to see you
out and about.

943
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:14,804
Yeah, I live to bowl.
Here's my number.

944
00:56:17,807 --> 00:56:19,308
Hey, Benny!

945
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:22,411
Hey, Cat.

946
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:39,962
- Nice to see you.
- You, too.

947
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:40,964
Hi.

948
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:42,464
Desiree, this is Cat.

949
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:43,966
Cat, Desiree.

950
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:44,968
Hi. You're very pretty.

951
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:47,336
Great jeans.
I gotta go.

952
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:50,340
Oh.

953
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:59,181
That was so stupid!

954
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:01,184
Well, I cannot believe...

955
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:02,684
What are you doing?

956
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:04,453
Just shut up and pretend
we're together.

957
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:06,688
- Okay.
- She struck out with Benny.

958
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:09,191
- Don't point.
- Who's the hottie?

959
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:12,628
I'm such an idiot.

960
00:57:12,629 --> 00:57:15,698
- He has a girlfriend.
- No, no, no. You got it all wrong.

961
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,668
Cat's not with Benny.
She's with Johnny.

962
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:29,379
Ow! Hey, I'm sorry, Mr. P.

963
00:57:34,283 --> 00:57:36,351
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Sorry.

964
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:37,853
Hey! What's
she doin'?

965
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:38,987
Patience.

966
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:41,056
We regulars have seniority.

967
00:57:41,057 --> 00:57:43,058
- Okay, that's fine, but...
- Isn't that right, Desiree?

968
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:45,179
- Just a few minutes...
- Get to the back of the line!

969
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:48,697
Thank you.
It's on the house.

970
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:50,733
- Thank you, Desiree.
- You're welcome.

971
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:52,734
Thank you, Stella.

972
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:54,736
Thank you, sweetie.

973
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:56,205
Chocolate.

974
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:59,508
We need more paddycakes.

975
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:02,310
They're animals out there.

976
00:58:02,311 --> 00:58:04,880
Hey, that's the way I like it.

977
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:06,148
When does Calvin get back?

978
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,216
Who knows?

979
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:10,218
Eddie!
Oh, thank goodness.

980
00:58:10,219 --> 00:58:12,579
- We need your help.
- How long has business been like this?

981
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:13,522
Since today.

982
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:15,991
Eddie, don't just stand there.
Do something.

983
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,025
Like what?

984
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:18,593
Wash the pans.

985
00:58:18,594 --> 00:58:20,062
I don't do dishes!

986
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:23,498
I make $600 an hour soaking
rich people in Manhattan!

987
00:58:23,499 --> 00:58:25,567
Let me clear off these.

988
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:29,572
I'll be right back.

989
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:33,375
Well, hello, ladies.

990
00:58:33,376 --> 00:58:34,910
I'm not really a waiter.

991
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:36,445
I'm actually rich and powerful.

992
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:37,946
I live on Central Park West.

993
00:58:37,947 --> 00:58:40,449
See that Benz there?
It's mine.

994
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:41,950
Right.

995
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:43,953
No? Okay.

996
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:47,456
Looks good, looks good.

997
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:49,925
There you go, June.
Thank you.

998
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:53,695
Everybody, I'm sorry.
We're sold out.

999
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:54,763
No!

1000
00:58:55,264 --> 00:58:56,265
Okay, tomorrow, tomorrow.

1001
00:58:56,766 --> 00:58:57,733
Please come back.

1002
00:58:57,734 --> 00:58:59,301
Thank you, Joyce.

1003
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:01,370
I'll have a dozen
for you, okay?

1004
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:03,939
Ah!

1005
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:07,943
Whew!

1006
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:10,445
Ah, we're closed.

1007
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:13,448
- Thank the Lord!
- Man, that was crazy.

1008
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:15,951
You know, this has been
the biggest day

1009
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:17,953
in the history of this bakery.

1010
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:19,955
Hi! Have you seen this?

1011
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:21,958
What's that?
What's this?

1012
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:27,763
"Life Just Got Sweeter On
The Other Side Of The River."

1013
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:31,667
They're calling Paddy's Bakery
"a little slice of nirvana."

1014
00:59:32,168 --> 00:59:33,169
Ooh, that's nice.

1015
00:59:33,669 --> 00:59:36,171
It talks about
you, too, Desiree.

1016
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:37,673
They love your paddycakes!

1017
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:39,274
Oh!

1018
00:59:39,275 --> 00:59:41,943
- How did they find us?
- Yeah.

1019
00:59:41,944 --> 00:59:44,012
It's the Gaultier girl!

1020
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:46,081
We're famous!

1021
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:55,457
Thanks for coming out.

1022
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:57,292
You're welcome, kiddo.

1023
00:59:57,293 --> 00:59:59,695
Would you mind dropping
these off to Andrei, my old doorman?

1024
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:02,497
Sure.

1025
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:05,767
Don't worry. I'm gonna have you
living back in the city in no time.

1026
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:06,835
Okay.

1027
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:09,337
Mwah! I got ideas.

1028
01:00:09,338 --> 01:00:11,339
All right.

1029
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,607
- See you soon.
- Drive safe.

1030
01:00:12,608 --> 01:00:14,176
I will.

1031
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:22,685
Desiree, Benny called earlier.

1032
01:00:23,686 --> 01:00:24,452
He did?

1033
01:00:24,453 --> 01:00:26,021
He asked us out.

1034
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:27,956
He asked who out?

1035
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:31,026
All of us.

1036
01:00:31,027 --> 01:00:33,028
Watch your step.

1037
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:36,499
You know, sometimes the
cement will attack you!

1038
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:38,533
Hello, hello!

1039
01:00:38,534 --> 01:00:42,070
Welcome to my humble abode!

1040
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:44,573
Ah, lovely to see you.

1041
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:46,042
Thank you, Francine.

1042
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:49,077
Thank you.
Please. That's great.

1043
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:50,579
- I'll put this in the kitchen.
- Thanks, Paddy.

1044
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,581
That's very kind of you.
Thank you very much.

1045
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:54,583
- Make yourselves at home now.
- Benny, how ya doin'?

1046
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:56,084
- Dino, good to see you.
- Good to see you.

1047
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:58,086
- Thanks for coming.
- I'll put this in the fridge.

1048
01:00:58,087 --> 01:01:01,089
Thank you, thank you.
You know where you're going.

1049
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:02,090
You shouldn't have.

1050
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:04,092
I should have.

1051
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:07,096
I'll put it
somewhere safe. Come on.

1052
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:13,101
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

1053
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:15,604
I didn't have your number,
so I called your dad.

1054
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:20,075
This is my uncle's wine
from Sicily.

1055
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:22,043
- Oh!
- It's wonderful.

1056
01:01:22,044 --> 01:01:25,113
- I have to try that.
- Merci bien, Elena.

1057
01:01:26,782 --> 01:01:28,783
- Smells so good.
- Thank you, thank you.

1058
01:01:28,784 --> 01:01:31,353
I hope you enjoy it.

1059
01:01:34,423 --> 01:01:36,424
Um, to your very good health.

1060
01:01:36,425 --> 01:01:38,426
It's really lovely
to have you all here.

1061
01:01:38,427 --> 01:01:39,928
It means a lot to me.
Cheers.

1062
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:42,430
Thank you. Cheers.

1063
01:01:42,431 --> 01:01:44,232
So much. Salute.

1064
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:45,367
Cheers.

1065
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:49,972
It's my pleasure.

1066
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:52,975
- Mm, fantastic.
- Oh.

1067
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:54,977
Benny,

1068
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:58,546
this is probably the best chicken
I've ever eaten in my whole life.

1069
01:01:58,547 --> 01:02:01,249
Well, thank you, Paddy,
but it's not chicken.

1070
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,817
It's not?

1071
01:02:02,818 --> 01:02:04,820
It's frog's legs, Paddy.

1072
01:02:06,555 --> 01:02:10,592
What the heck, ya know?
As long as it doesn't hop off the plate.

1073
01:02:14,096 --> 01:02:16,164
No, no, I disagree.

1074
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:18,133
Opera should only be
sung in Italian.

1075
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:20,669
It's the most romantic
language in the world, huh?

1076
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:24,172
Yeah, but the French,
they sing the best love songs.

1077
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:26,675
Well, yeah, I think
you're both crazy.

1078
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:29,945
'Cause the best thing
in the world is a good Irish jig.

1079
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:31,513
An Irish jig?

1080
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:32,948
I know how to settle this.

1081
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:38,987
♪ Way, hey, and away, yah ♪

1082
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:42,657
♪ We'll pay Paddy Doyle
for his boots ♪

1083
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:46,161

with a fling, yah ♪

1084
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:49,665
♪ And pay Paddy Doyle
for his boots ♪

1085
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:51,766
Thank you for this.

1086
01:02:51,767 --> 01:02:54,602
My father hasn't been
on a date in seven years.

1087
01:02:54,603 --> 01:02:56,171
It's my pleasure.

1088
01:02:58,174 --> 01:03:01,176
Would you like a quick tour?

1089
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:03,178
- I'd love one.
- Come on.

1090
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:05,513
♪ Way, hey, and away, yah ♪

1091
01:03:05,514 --> 01:03:08,450
♪ We'll pay Paddy Doyle
for his boots ♪

1092
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:12,020
Ah, yes, so the guests
all stay up there,

1093
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:15,657
and, um, this is where I live.

1094
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:22,630
That's an elevator in there,
but it doesn't work.

1095
01:03:22,631 --> 01:03:24,699
Nice.

1096
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:27,702
And in there is the library.
Lots of books.

1097
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:30,839
Books.
I love books.

1098
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,676
You love books?
I love books.

1099
01:03:36,178 --> 01:03:38,246
Oh, that's my office in there,

1100
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:39,748
but it's a little disorganized.

1101
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:41,250
You don't want to look in that.

1102
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:44,252
Okay.

1103
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:47,255
How is it that you don't
have a significant other?

1104
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:49,257
- Oh, I did have. She was French.
- Oh.

1105
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:52,260
She hated New Jersey. In the end,
she didn't care for me much either.

1106
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:54,262
Ah, French girls are tough.

1107
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:55,764
Brutal.

1108
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:06,275
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

1109
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:24,794
Oh, that's my great uncle.
Just ignore him.

1110
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:26,295
Okay.

1111
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:30,298
Perhaps we should
continue the tour.

1112
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:31,800
Yes.

1113
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,804
- Uh, we have a problem.
- What is it?

1114
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:38,306
We've run out of hallway.

1115
01:04:38,307 --> 01:04:40,308
And they've stopped singing.

1116
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:43,278
Benny, come on down here!
It's your turn now!

1117
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:44,813
Yeah! Come on!

1118
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:47,316
- Rain check?
- Absolutely.

1119
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,769
- We need more coconut cream.
- Already?

1120
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:09,538
Oh, wow!
That's a good thing.

1121
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:13,275
Any calls?

1122
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:14,442
Nope.

1123
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:16,445
It's only been two days.

1124
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:18,780
It's too soon
for Benny to call.

1125
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:21,683
Yeah, that would violate
the three-day rule.

1126
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:24,586
Yeah, man. Women like it
when you make them wait.

1127
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,622
I got a news flash for you men.
The three-day rule is stupid.

1128
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:29,958
Women don't like it.
It just makes us angry.

1129
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:32,795
I don't care what happens.
Do not call Benny.

1130
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:34,129
I'm not.

1131
01:05:34,396 --> 01:05:35,964
- Just relax.
- Yeah, man, chill.

1132
01:05:36,398 --> 01:05:37,932
I am the queen of chill!

1133
01:05:39,935 --> 01:05:41,937
I could care less
if Benny calls or not.

1134
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:47,442
Paddy's.

1135
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,444
I mean, Desiree here.

1136
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,947
I'm a genius.

1137
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:55,651
It's Eddie.

1138
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,453
Hi. Look,
we're very busy here.

1139
01:05:58,721 --> 01:05:59,788
What is it?

1140
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:01,990
I would love
to buy you a hot dog.

1141
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:03,958
What?

1142
01:06:03,959 --> 01:06:05,327
No, not you, Desiree.

1143
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:06,662
How 'bout a pretzel?

1144
01:06:07,062 --> 01:06:08,630
Eddie, focus.

1145
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,632
- No...
- Yo, what are you doin'?

1146
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,634
Come on! You're
scaring off my customers!

1147
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:13,635
Give me one of those.

1148
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:16,137
- Look, I'm hanging up, Eddie.
- Desiree, wait!

1149
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:17,639
Keep the change.

1150
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:21,142
I got you
a Willy Wonka of a deal,

1151
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:23,144
and you're gonna love it!

1152
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:25,647
Zwieback International

1153
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:28,149
wants to franchise
Paddy's Bakery.

1154
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,151
Are you serious?

1155
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:34,155
Yeah! They're going crazy over
the whole paddycakes thing.

1156
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:36,157
We can talk about
my commission later.

1157
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:39,160
We gotta move fast,
while I got 'em salivating.

1158
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:41,163
Hang on. Daddy...

1159
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,667
Zwieback wants to
franchise the bakery.

1160
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,834
They want to meet
with us Friday.

1161
01:06:46,835 --> 01:06:49,337
Great. Get me
the flour, sweetheart.

1162
01:06:50,839 --> 01:06:52,340
Did you hear me?

1163
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:53,841
Yeah, I heard you.

1164
01:06:53,842 --> 01:06:57,345
Look, I'm not going
to the big city. You go.

1165
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:00,348
Okay.

1166
01:07:00,849 --> 01:07:01,849
We're on.

1167
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:06,855
Great. Oh, and, Desiree,
they're gonna pick you up.

1168
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:21,904
Hey, Daddy, are you sure
you're okay with me negotiating for you?

1169
01:07:22,137 --> 01:07:23,705
Well, of course.

1170
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:28,543
It's just...
It's your bakery, and this is a huge deal.

1171
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:31,379
Sweetheart, it's not my bakery.

1172
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,381
It's our bakery.

1173
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:35,217
Thank you for saying that.

1174
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:37,586
I just hope I don't mess it up.

1175
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:39,053
You won't.

1176
01:07:39,054 --> 01:07:40,388
How do you know?

1177
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:43,091
Because you're a Kerrigan.

1178
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:47,296
Now, go get 'em, tiger.

1179
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:51,233
Desiree!
Good luck, darlin'!

1180
01:07:57,239 --> 01:08:01,109
"Saw the article.
Us girls want to have drinks."

1181
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:04,913
Ah! Perfect.
"See you at 5."

1182
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:08,449
Look out, New York.
I'm back.

1183
01:08:10,786 --> 01:08:12,466
- Okay, they're ready for you.
- All right.

1184
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:16,125
Hey, Benny must be
pretty busy, huh?

1185
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:17,925
- He went to Paris.
- Paris?

1186
01:08:17,926 --> 01:08:19,127
It was an unexpected trip.

1187
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:22,263
Gabrielle had
some sort of crisis.

1188
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:24,632
Have a safe flight.

1189
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:26,134
Uh, thanks.

1190
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:54,996
- Oh.
- Mm.

1191
01:08:55,998 --> 01:08:58,300
Marcus Kelly Macaroons.

1192
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:00,135
One of our franchises.

1193
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:03,405
So, Mrs. Harper...

1194
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:05,340
Please, call me Desiree.

1195
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:07,842
Of course.

1196
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:12,313
Desiree, we do things
differently here at Zwieback International.

1197
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:15,317
Anyone can franchise
a successful product,

1198
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,653
but can they capture
the atmosphere

1199
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:21,989
of love and caring that
has become the very essence

1200
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:24,492
of what Paddy's Bakery
stands for?

1201
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:26,261
Picture this:

1202
01:09:26,462 --> 01:09:29,530
The quintessential
family bakery,

1203
01:09:29,531 --> 01:09:32,333
established in 1892,

1204
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:37,538
bringing a little slice
of home to the big city.

1205
01:09:37,539 --> 01:09:42,010
We have a deal memo here
for you to sign. James?

1206
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:46,681
I'm sure you'll find our offer
more than satisfactory.

1207
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,554
In addition
to the signing bonus,

1208
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:56,391
Desiree will have the title
of co-executive director.

1209
01:09:56,658 --> 01:09:58,693
Mm. With my father.

1210
01:10:01,196 --> 01:10:07,201
Well, we would be happy
to discuss a minimal involvement for him.

1211
01:10:07,202 --> 01:10:09,203
Minimal?

1212
01:10:09,204 --> 01:10:13,208
Well, Desiree,
with all due respect,

1213
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:15,210
he is in his sunset years,

1214
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:19,213
and we are launching a new
contemporary franchise.

1215
01:10:19,214 --> 01:10:22,216
Yeah, we really want to push
the envelope on this one.

1216
01:10:22,217 --> 01:10:24,719
And push my father out
in the process?

1217
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,988
Well, we'd keep him on
for the first few months.

1218
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:28,756
- A few months?
- Whoa, whoa, come on.

1219
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:30,759
Yeah, wait, wait, wait.
What happened here?

1220
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:34,262
Just a minute ago, you had us
picturing Paddy's Bakery

1221
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:36,765
as a snug, cozy
little slice of home.

1222
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:40,268
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
but the twist is there's no room for dad.

1223
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:43,604
May I suggest you have
another look at the offer.

1224
01:10:43,605 --> 01:10:44,605
Don't look at it.

1225
01:10:44,606 --> 01:10:47,108
I'm sure your father
would be happy retiring

1226
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:50,112
in sunny Florida
with a big fat check.

1227
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:53,581
See, that's where you're wrong.

1228
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:57,084
Because your greedy gluttonous
muffins will come and go,

1229
01:10:57,085 --> 01:11:00,588
but my father is Paddy's Bakery,

1230
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:03,592
and he is very happy
working in Flemington.

1231
01:11:05,093 --> 01:11:06,594
So what does this mean?

1232
01:11:08,096 --> 01:11:08,996
Desiree?

1233
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:21,443
Sorry, gentlemen,
but we have no deal.

1234
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:22,945
Rule!

1235
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:28,450
I'm just gonna take these.

1236
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:40,628
Desiree, I can't believe I'm saying this,

1237
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:43,130
but you did the right thing.

1238
01:11:43,131 --> 01:11:45,133
Thanks, Eddie.

1239
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:51,772
Hi.

1240
01:11:51,773 --> 01:11:53,841
- Hey.
- Hello there.

1241
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:57,345
No, no, no, no.
Excuse me. We ordered Bellinis.

1242
01:11:57,346 --> 01:12:00,348
That is champagne
with white peaches, not yellow.

1243
01:12:00,349 --> 01:12:02,351
Don't think he understood me.

1244
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:05,820
Sorry, Desiree.
This place has really gone to the natives.

1245
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:07,355
So are you on your way?

1246
01:12:09,358 --> 01:12:10,858
I don't think I can make it.

1247
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:14,462
What happened? I thought you were
staying in town to shop for apartments?

1248
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:18,032
You know, suddenly
I've changed my mind.

1249
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:20,034
Why?

1250
01:12:20,035 --> 01:12:22,703
Because I don't fit
in here anymore.

1251
01:12:22,704 --> 01:12:26,207
And you know what?
I don't want to.

1252
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:29,711
Goodbye.

1253
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:41,223
So, now what?

1254
01:12:42,724 --> 01:12:44,225
I'm going home.

1255
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:03,478
Benny.

1256
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:10,052
Watch your head, ma'am.

1257
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,055
This way.

1258
01:13:19,227 --> 01:13:20,361
Wade?

1259
01:13:20,362 --> 01:13:22,831
I had to see you.

1260
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,866
How did you know I was here?

1261
01:13:25,867 --> 01:13:27,435
I called the bakery.

1262
01:13:31,773 --> 01:13:34,275
Desiree. I'm sorry.

1263
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:36,277
Olive dumped you, didn't she?

1264
01:13:36,278 --> 01:13:38,746
- Yeah.
- Ha! And a baby on the way?

1265
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:41,782
- A false alarm.
- Oh, big surprise there.

1266
01:13:41,783 --> 01:13:45,286
I know I screwed up,
but just give us a second chance.

1267
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:46,754
We can have
a beautiful life together.

1268
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:48,789
We had a beautiful
life together, Wade.

1269
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:50,792
It wasn't enough for you.

1270
01:13:54,296 --> 01:13:59,300
When did you get this?

1271
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:02,803
I had a momentary
midlife crisis.

1272
01:14:02,804 --> 01:14:04,805
It won't happen again.

1273
01:14:04,806 --> 01:14:07,541
But isn't it gorgeous?

1274
01:14:07,542 --> 01:14:10,611
Come on. Now, let me
take you back home.

1275
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:13,381
To Manhattan, where you belong.

1276
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,918
Things have changed
for me now, Wade.

1277
01:14:18,987 --> 01:14:19,988
All right.

1278
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:24,925
At least let me drive you
to the bakery. Come on.

1279
01:14:24,926 --> 01:14:26,494
All right.

1280
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:30,999
You're gonna love it. Hmm?

1281
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:34,002
That's it.

1282
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:46,514
You'll see, Desiree.

1283
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:49,017
I'm not the selfish idiot
I used to be.

1284
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:54,022
I've changed.

1285
01:14:57,793 --> 01:14:59,094
Son of-

1286
01:15:09,438 --> 01:15:11,005
I didn't see you coming.
I'm so sorry.

1287
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:13,841
You better be, big boy.
That's a $285,000 Ferrari!

1288
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:17,445
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay, okay.
- Wade!

1289
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:19,380
What are doing?
Leave Benny alone!

1290
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:21,349
- You know this idiot?
- Yes!

1291
01:15:21,883 --> 01:15:23,317
- Hi.
- Hi.

1292
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:24,852
How is Gabrielle?

1293
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:27,388
My mother?
She's fine now.

1294
01:15:27,389 --> 01:15:29,890
Hello? Do I
look like I care?

1295
01:15:29,891 --> 01:15:31,959
- Did you say your mother?
- Yeah.

1296
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:33,961
Desiree, would you get
back in the car, please?

1297
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:35,529
No!

1298
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:37,531
I've changed my mind, Wade.

1299
01:15:37,532 --> 01:15:40,367
What's wrong with you?
You have a perfectly simple decision.

1300
01:15:40,368 --> 01:15:42,403
You either take
the high life or the low life!

1301
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:44,872
- You're the lowlife.
- Hey.

1302
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:47,007
Don't you think you've
embarrassed yourself enough already?

1303
01:15:47,008 --> 01:15:48,576
Back off, baguette boy!

1304
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:50,545
You back off, bucko!

1305
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:56,051
Ow! Ooh!

1306
01:15:56,551 --> 01:15:58,652
Oh!

1307
01:15:58,653 --> 01:16:00,721
- You... You hit him!
- Uh-huh.

1308
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:03,725
Ohh...

1309
01:16:12,667 --> 01:16:15,736
I need to find a better place
for that birdhouse.

1310
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:31,252
I've got it, thanks.

1311
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:33,255
Yep, in front of
all of my customers.

1312
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:38,259
I don't think I've ever
felt so... emasculated.

1313
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:42,763
Yeah. Sorry.

1314
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:46,267
Is there something
I could do to help restore your reputation?

1315
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:48,270
Well, since you asked.

1316
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:19,133
Surprise!

1317
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:20,668
Yeah!

1318
01:17:28,176 --> 01:17:31,178
I'm sorry, Daddy.

1319
01:17:31,179 --> 01:17:33,113
There is no franchise deal.

1320
01:17:33,114 --> 01:17:35,649
I know. Eddie called.

1321
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:39,154
You do realize that,
if you'd have signed that deal,

1322
01:17:39,654 --> 01:17:42,623
you'd have your life back
on Fifth Avenue right now?

1323
01:17:42,624 --> 01:17:44,826
It wasn't worth it.

1324
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:48,329
Thank you for not
selling your daddy out.

1325
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,332
I'm so proud of you.

1326
01:17:53,668 --> 01:17:57,672
That means more to me than
any penthouse on any avenue.

1327
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:00,674
I love you, Daddy.

1328
01:18:00,675 --> 01:18:02,677
Good girl.

1329
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:08,649
Desiree, you did
the right thing by Mr. P.

1330
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:13,220
- Good job.
- And that is something to celebrate.

1331
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:14,221
It is.

1332
01:18:14,222 --> 01:18:16,457
Calvin, let's have some music.

1333
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:17,792
You got it, Mr. P.

1334
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:23,865
Hey! I'm sorry I'm late.

1335
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:26,368
Us peons had to drive.

1336
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:29,503
- Eddie!
- Plus, I had to pick up my date.

1337
01:18:30,805 --> 01:18:34,875
- Ooh-whoo!
- Tamika! Look at you!

1338
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:37,645
You are a goddess.

1339
01:18:37,646 --> 01:18:42,683
You were right. Once I lost the
bulletproof vest, it fit like a glove.

1340
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:45,686
So when did you two happen?

1341
01:18:45,687 --> 01:18:48,256
Well, I could ask
you two the same thing.

1342
01:18:48,757 --> 01:18:51,892
Well, it's party time!

1343
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:53,193
What are you thinking?

1344
01:18:53,194 --> 01:18:58,199
You know, life is sweeter on
the other side of the river.

1345
01:18:59,768 --> 01:19:01,268
