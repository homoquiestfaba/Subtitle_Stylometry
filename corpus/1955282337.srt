And yet, there are moments...

201
00:18:19,689 --> 00:18:24,477
Why? Because of an inherent weakness?

No.

your faith in Lord God...

It's fine, taking a step was my decision.
We've covered that.

I know that my behavior
has been irregular,

236

but I've told you over and over
that there are some changes, and...

- You've had time.

- Weeks.
- Then I need more... time I guess.

Yes, and I appreciate it.

If I decide that something is for the best,
I think that my wife should honor that.

247

Bram, you haven't slept in almost a month.

00:21:57,206 --> 00:21:59,352
You're barely eating.

249
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:03,656

- Sarah.

I'm not drinking, you know that.
It's a fact.

My head does.

253
00:22:14,858 --> 00:22:19,262
Bramwell, the position
you've taken is valid.

254
00:22:19,362 --> 00:22:22,832
Ephesians asks that wives submit
unto their husbands

255
00:22:22,932 --> 00:22:25,068
as they would unto the Lord.

256
00:22:25,168 --> 00:22:29,538
For the husband is the head of the wife
as Christ is the head of the church,

257
00:22:29,638 --> 00:22:33,543
and therefore,
as the church submits to Christ,

258
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,779
so let wives do unto their husbands.

259
00:22:36,879 --> 00:22:38,589
However...

260
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:42,671
your position has validity too, Sarah.

261
00:22:43,486 --> 00:22:45,481
What you described,

262
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:48,424
and described on several occasions,

263
00:22:48,524 --> 00:22:52,495
is behavior that is,
to say the least, unusual.

264
00:22:52,895 --> 00:22:56,966
And it seems to me is indicative
of a larger problem,

265
00:22:57,066 --> 00:23:00,069
but we're not going to make any progress

like this for as long as it takes.

the house with some sort of photocopy.

It constantly reminds me
of how things were...

274
00:23:35,538 --> 00:23:38,117
and I can't go back to that.

to carry it out.

the end times are nigh.

that unlike the cruel heathen deities,

338
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,718

only spiritual surrender.

Bram?

369
00:30:52,825 --> 00:30:55,371
You questioned my will.

370
00:30:56,912 --> 00:31:00,449
You shake your fist at me in defiance.

- All who meddle.
- Stop this right now.

- Stop it!

at a sort of good news, bad news situation.

Good news is, there does not appear to be
a single thing medically wrong with you.

Everything is right where it needs to be.

if everything you've told me
is the God's honest truth...

None of this is okay.

399
00:32:51,894 --> 00:32:56,271
I appreciate that, Bram, which is why
we're taking steps to get you well.

400
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,847
Look, Uriel spoke very highly of Dr. Kore.

401
00:33:02,905 --> 00:33:06,208
- With any luck, maybe he'll...
- He's not a doctor.

402
00:33:06,658 --> 00:33:08,770
He's a shrink.

403
00:33:09,478 --> 00:33:12,291
I think it's the same thing.

404
00:33:13,081 --> 00:33:16,084
I'm gonna go there,
and he's gonna say that I'm crazy

405
00:33:16,184 --> 00:33:20,656
and put me on all sorts of medications
or ship me off somewhere

406
00:33:20,756 --> 00:33:22,958
where I'm not gonna be able
to see either of you anymore.

407
00:33:23,058 --> 00:33:25,010
Bram, what's happening to you?

408
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:28,030
I don't know
what's happening to me, Sarah.

409
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:31,436
I just... I think that maybe we're looking
for answers in the wrong places.

410
00:33:31,536 --> 00:33:33,982
Wrong places?

411
00:33:34,082 --> 00:33:36,681
- We devoted ourselves to something, Sarah.
- (SIGHS)

412
00:33:37,873 --> 00:33:40,285
Something bigger than ourselves.

413
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:44,346
Something that has been there for us
through good and through bad.

414
00:33:44,446 --> 00:33:47,850
Something that's solved our problems when
we both didn't think we could get lower,

415
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:51,653
and I don't think that it's in our best
interest to just cast that off the moment...

416
00:33:51,753 --> 00:33:53,855
The moment that what?

417
00:33:53,955 --> 00:33:56,769
Mind your tone. Please.

418
00:33:58,694 --> 00:34:01,563
It's worth thinking about,
that's all I'm saying.

419
00:34:01,663 --> 00:34:04,283
No, Bram, I saw something the other night
that I've never seen before.

420
00:34:04,383 --> 00:34:07,035
I don't think anyone has ever seen before.

421
00:34:07,135 --> 00:34:10,122
Okay, I don't know who was speaking to me
in our bedroom, but it wasn't you.

422
00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:12,675
Do you understand?

423
00:34:12,775 --> 00:34:16,111
So what happens the next time
that little visitor decides to show up?

424
00:34:16,211 --> 00:34:18,914
But instead of just talking, he wanders
into the kitchen and gets a knife

425
00:34:19,014 --> 00:34:20,616
and finishes the business out for himself.

426
00:34:20,716 --> 00:34:23,018
I don't think that that's
the way that it works.

427
00:34:23,118 --> 00:34:26,554
If God wanted Skya dead, Bram...

428
00:34:26,654 --> 00:34:28,123
she would be dead.

429
00:34:28,223 --> 00:34:33,128
He would have caved the roof in on her
or blown out my tires with her in the car

430
00:34:33,228 --> 00:34:36,565
or set off a gas leak one of the ten times
a day that she's in the kitchen,

431
00:34:36,665 --> 00:34:38,901
but she's still here, healthy as can be.

432
00:34:39,001 --> 00:34:42,437
Sarah, I'm sorry, but I don't think
that that's the way that it works.

433
00:34:42,537 --> 00:34:45,731
I think His children
need to act on their own.

434
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:49,578
Great, so our alternative is what?

435
00:34:49,978 --> 00:34:51,747
You just keep having these visions

436
00:34:51,847 --> 00:34:55,150
night after night for the rest
of your life for the next 50 years?

437
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:58,887
God will not suffer you to be tempted
above that ye are able.

438
00:34:58,987 --> 00:35:03,502
But will with that temptation make away
to escape that ye shall be able to bear it.

439
00:35:05,227 --> 00:35:07,639
I will bear what I must.

440
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:11,199
It was what? Three weeks.

441
00:35:11,299 --> 00:35:16,171
Three weeks until you stopped
acknowledging our child all together.

442
00:35:16,271 --> 00:35:18,707
How many more nights
until you stop sleeping,

443
00:35:18,807 --> 00:35:21,677
avoiding what's happening completely?

444
00:35:21,977 --> 00:35:24,813
And how long after that
until you turn back to alcohol?

445
00:35:24,913 --> 00:35:28,183
How long after that
until you break entirely?

446
00:35:28,283 --> 00:35:31,130
I will bare what I must.

447
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:35,901
What are you suggesting then?

448
00:35:36,725 --> 00:35:39,094
We asked the minister for help
and that didn't work.

449
00:35:39,194 --> 00:35:42,631
(LAUGHING)
Oh, that didn't work spectacularly.

450
00:35:42,731 --> 00:35:44,967
We looked for physical evidence.

451
00:35:45,067 --> 00:35:47,079
Nothing there.

452
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:52,093
So if not this next step,
if not cold, clinical,

453
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:55,251
psychiatric diagnosis... then what?

454
00:35:55,351 --> 00:35:58,647
I don't know. I don't know.

455
00:35:58,747 --> 00:36:03,197
But... I think if we're willing
to surrender our faith so easily then...

456
00:36:03,297 --> 00:36:06,155
- what was the point of any of it?
- I am not surrendering a thing.

457
00:36:06,255 --> 00:36:09,238
I am making sure that the death
of our infant daughter isn't the result

458
00:36:09,338 --> 00:36:11,848
of a chemical imbalance
in her father's brain.

459
00:36:23,538 --> 00:36:25,841

and you're always saying that...

Would you mind coming over
and spending some time with her?

- Oh, hi.
- Hello.

You and your Joseph. Was that his name?

- Are you...

I think I'm...

00:38:39,407 --> 00:38:41,806
I might have made some
unfair judgments before,

479
00:38:41,906 --> 00:38:45,277
and that's not the person
I strive to be, so...

482
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:56,258
what was that party you had
at your place a couple weeks back?

483
00:38:56,358 --> 00:38:59,144
- You know, had to do with little, uh...
- Oh, Skya.

484
00:38:59,244 --> 00:39:03,065
Skya. Oh, my God, how cute is that?
What was it, her birthday or something?

485
00:39:03,165 --> 00:39:05,167
- No, it was her Christening.
- Oh.

486
00:39:05,267 --> 00:39:09,538
Now, explain something to me,
'cause I guess I've never really known.

487
00:39:10,038 --> 00:39:13,642
What is a Christening? I mean,
it's kind of like a baptism, right?

00:39:13,742 --> 00:39:18,146
There's a ceremony and the rest of it,
but, you know, what's it mean?

489
00:39:18,246 --> 00:39:21,149
It's a sacrament. It means a divine grace.

really believe all that?

And your answer is, yes, Gabe,
that is exactly what I believe.

Hi.

511
00:40:38,193 --> 00:40:40,495
- Did you see the doctor?
- Yes.

512
00:40:40,595 --> 00:40:42,909
Did you or are you lying to me?

513

Please don't speak to me like that.

514
00:40:48,236 --> 00:40:51,817
Yes, I saw him. We talked for a long time.

515
00:40:52,774 --> 00:40:56,044
My session with him went 40 minutes over,
but he said not to worry about it,

516
00:40:56,144 --> 00:40:58,581
because I took precedence.

517
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,183
He's a man of faith, Sarah.

518
00:41:01,283 --> 00:41:05,065

there's no doubt about that, but...

- My mother was here.

521

- What sort of ideas did this man have?

He told me to try it for a few weeks,
and if nothing changes then he had...

There's no use in getting ahead
of ourselves. Until we know more.

527

in several senses of the word.

528
00:41:43,758 --> 00:41:47,439
King Saul lost three children...

529
00:41:48,496 --> 00:41:51,333
and rather than live
with everything that happened,

530
00:41:51,433 --> 00:41:53,568
everything that was going to happen...

531
00:41:53,668 --> 00:41:56,014
He fell on his sword.

532
00:41:56,571 --> 00:42:01,252
I want you to think very carefully
before you say anything else.

533
00:42:11,386 --> 00:42:14,099
I want you to please explain this.

534
00:42:15,557 --> 00:42:17,893
- Where did that come from?
- Is it yours?

535
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:21,663
- What do you mean is it mine?
- I think I was pretty fucking clear, Bram.

536
00:42:21,763 --> 00:42:24,476
- Watch your language.
- Answer the question.

537

539
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,452
Not once.

540
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:37,956
Because I respect your privacy.

541
00:42:39,047 --> 00:42:41,293
You found that in a trash can?

542
00:42:42,384 --> 00:42:44,496
Somewhere nearby.

543
00:42:46,421 --> 00:42:48,366
Then yes.

544
00:42:49,023 --> 00:42:51,036
It is mine.

545
00:42:52,761 --> 00:42:56,296
- So what? What, all of the visions...
- It's not what you think.

546
00:42:56,396 --> 00:42:59,545
- ...they're all just part of some big...
- Listen to me!

547
00:43:00,368 --> 00:43:03,405
It's mine, but I didn't drink any of it.

548
00:43:03,855 --> 00:43:07,842
I never have. Not once in all of
the months that I've been doing it.

549
00:43:07,942 --> 00:43:10,025
All of the months
that you've been doing what?

550
00:43:11,546 --> 00:43:14,082
This is gonna sound like a story.

551
00:43:14,182 --> 00:43:17,262
That's why I avoided
telling you in the first place.

552
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:22,491
I knew it would be difficult
for someone else to understand.

553
00:43:23,091 --> 00:43:27,705
But I have been sober for more than 3
months. That's the God's honest truth.

554
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:31,966
I chose you and Skya
over the bottle, right?

555
00:43:32,066 --> 00:43:34,836
But I don't work late on Thursdays.

556
00:43:34,936 --> 00:43:37,148
I never have.

557
00:43:38,306 --> 00:43:40,518
Every Thursday night...

558
00:43:41,776 --> 00:43:45,957
since the first week of my sobriety, I...

559
00:43:49,534 --> 00:43:51,466
I have a ritual.

560
00:43:51,886 --> 00:43:53,888
A way to prove it to myself.

561
00:43:53,988 --> 00:43:55,353
Prove what?

562
00:43:55,453 --> 00:43:58,103
I go to Mark's Liquor on ninth.

563
00:43:59,561 --> 00:44:02,841
I buy a 37 ounce bottle of Nu-ball...

564
00:44:04,132 --> 00:44:06,320
and I go to our spot.

565
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:09,904
On Magetto Fire Road,
and I look out at the city.

566
00:44:10,004 --> 00:44:12,207
The lights.

567
00:44:12,307 --> 00:44:15,731
I think of all the people unburdened
by my problems,

568
00:44:15,831 --> 00:44:21,293
and I think about all the people burdened
by problems much worse than mine.

569
00:44:25,086 --> 00:44:28,056
And then I pour out every drop...

570
00:44:28,456 --> 00:44:30,735
and come home.

571
00:44:32,227 --> 00:44:34,429
To prove it to yourself?

572
00:44:34,529 --> 00:44:38,450
To prove that alcohol and I
can exist in the same world.

573
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,845
So why risk it?

574
00:44:41,169 --> 00:44:44,172
Why risk bringing the bottles back here,
why not just leave them there?

575
00:44:44,272 --> 00:44:46,284
I don't know.

576
00:44:47,575 --> 00:44:49,787

Jacob hasn't been out
of Anti-OC for years.

I guess you remember that Jacob was weird.

612
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,110
Just antisocial. We thought
low level Asperger's or something,

613
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:46,314
but nothing... nothing that could
ever become dangerous.

614
00:48:46,414 --> 00:48:50,017
But he started to have...

615
00:48:50,117 --> 00:48:53,020
outbursts, temper tantrums
he was too old to be having

616
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,690
in places he shouldn't
have been having them.

617
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:59,160
- Wasn't anyone concerned?
- Of course we were concerned.

618
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:02,596
But they were having trouble diagnosing him,
and there'd be long periods of time

619
00:49:02,696 --> 00:49:04,909

but it's always the same.

I'm just trying to gather
as much information as I can.

630
00:49:34,495 --> 00:49:37,842
Information is fine,
just don't start looking for meaning.

631
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:43,270
One day Jacob told us that he
was hearing voices in his head

632
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:45,009
every time he tried to go to sleep,

633
00:49:45,109 --> 00:49:49,169
so, obviously we all got on
the diagnosis train in a big way and...

634
00:49:49,269 --> 00:49:52,313
by that point it had been going on
much longer than we knew about,

635
00:49:52,413 --> 00:49:54,348
and he was near the edge.

636
00:49:54,448 --> 00:49:57,679
Did he ever tell you
what the voices were saying?

637
00:49:59,453 --> 00:50:01,666
Not at first, no.

638
00:50:02,824 --> 00:50:07,462
But after, when the police asked why
he had put the knife in so many times,

639
00:50:07,562 --> 00:50:12,777
he said it was because the voice told him
to cut out our mother's heart.

640
00:50:17,038 --> 00:50:19,207
You didn't come here
for any kind of confirmation,

641
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:22,777
so why don't you just tell me
what you wanna know.

642
00:50:23,077 --> 00:50:26,124
I guess the... the only thing is that...

643
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:33,731
If you could have done anything
differently, what would it have been?

644
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:38,960
I would have had my brother locked
in the deepest, darkest hole,

645
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,229
and sold the key for scrap metal,

646
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:44,876
and if that didn't work,
I would have killed him.

705
00:54:34,829 --> 00:54:37,041
<i>And the voice.</i>

<i>I feel like it could kill me

711
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,773
Okay, Bram, listen to me.

712
00:54:56,417 --> 00:54:59,120
Have you spoken to Dr. Kore?

713
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:01,499
That was the next step, right?

714
00:55:03,224 --> 00:55:05,812
If this didn't work he said that...

715
00:55:05,912 --> 00:55:08,606
that he had something you could try.

716
00:55:09,763 --> 00:55:12,209
<i>Something we could try.</i>

717
00:55:14,435 --> 00:55:16,647
<i>I just got off the phone with him.</i>

718
00:55:18,205 --> 00:55:21,452
<i>He said it's something
we need to be in on together.</i>

721
00:55:31,218 --> 00:55:32,864
Yeah.

722
00:55:35,489 --> 00:55:37,702
Where should I meet you?

723
00:55:40,094 --> 00:55:42,136
<i>I'm outside.</i>

DOCTOR: I'd like to thank you both
for making the trip.

726
00:56:27,875 --> 00:56:32,513
The office can be so impersonal
for visits like this.

727
00:56:32,913 --> 00:56:37,251
Doctor, excuse me, I assume Bram
has brought you up to speed.

728
00:56:37,351 --> 00:56:43,003
- I told him everything.
- Oh, yes, and it is a beautiful story.

729
00:56:43,624 --> 00:56:45,703
Pardon me?

730
00:56:46,527 --> 00:56:49,741
Remarkable. Extraordinary.

731
00:56:50,664 --> 00:56:54,368
I am of a mind that anything which can be
considered truly remarkable in this world

732
00:56:54,468 --> 00:56:58,949
of quantifiable data,
should be considered beautiful.

733
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,452
Do you not agree?

734
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:03,373
- Wow, look at him.
- Sarah.

735
00:57:03,473 --> 00:57:06,047
No. No, look at him.

736
00:57:06,147 --> 00:57:08,916
I have had to watch him
recognize and then resist,

737
00:57:09,016 --> 00:57:11,285
and then fight tooth and nail
against whatever it is

738
00:57:11,385 --> 00:57:14,688
that is trying it's damnedest
to rip his mind apart.

739
00:57:14,788 --> 00:57:17,091
And you're standing here
telling me that it's beautiful?

740
00:57:17,191 --> 00:57:22,830
No, no, no. Of course not.
Not in the traditional sense.

741
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:25,409
He said you could help us.

742
00:57:26,233 --> 00:57:27,835
Understand.

743
00:57:27,935 --> 00:57:30,438
I make no promises.

744
00:57:30,538 --> 00:57:32,773
I have prescribed your husband
enough medication

745
00:57:32,873 --> 00:57:36,343
to knock the wren activity out
of a west Indian manatee.

746
00:57:36,443 --> 00:57:38,756
And it's only made things worse.

747
00:57:40,214 --> 00:57:45,845
Which leaves me to believe that what we
are dealing with is not entirely internal.

748
00:57:46,287 --> 00:57:49,790
- What I said from the beginning was...
- What you have said from the beginning,

749
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:54,061
as you perceive it, is that God
or something very much in his image

750
00:57:54,161 --> 00:57:56,430
appeared to you the night
of your daughter's Christening,

751
00:57:56,530 --> 00:58:01,402
and almost every night since then,
commanding you to take her life.

752
00:58:01,502 --> 00:58:04,038
Not unlike the binding of Issac.

753
00:58:04,138 --> 00:58:06,337
- Yes.
- Yes.

754
00:58:07,841 --> 00:58:12,179
I once had a patient who I knew relatively
straight away was manic depressive.

755
00:58:12,279 --> 00:58:15,256
At first, oh, he denied it. Vehemently.

756
00:58:15,356 --> 00:58:19,386
Delusions of grandeur
so characteristic of the disease.

757
00:58:19,486 --> 00:58:22,089
He was unyielding.

758
00:58:22,189 --> 00:58:25,593
So I invited him here
one evening like this.

759
00:58:25,693 --> 00:58:28,496
I made ajiaco like tonight.

760
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:31,466
You've both seen that there is corn in it.

761
00:58:32,066 --> 00:58:34,035
I'm sorry, what are you talking about?

762
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:37,848
By the time we were ready to eat,
he had withdrawn.

763
00:58:38,772 --> 00:58:40,808
He refused to make conversation.

764
00:58:40,908 --> 00:58:44,945
So, I made a little remark
about where I'd got the corn.

765
00:58:45,045 --> 00:58:48,459
At a farmer's market.
And do you know what he said?

766
00:58:51,618 --> 00:58:53,297
No.

767
00:58:55,039 --> 00:58:57,341
No, you didn't get it there?

768
00:58:57,441 --> 00:59:00,728
No. To the corn in it's entirety.

769
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:05,232
There's no corn in this he said.
Spooning the corn into his mouth.

770
00:59:05,532 --> 00:59:07,701
There was no change in his demeanor.

771
00:59:07,801 --> 00:59:10,456
He wasn't having an episode
or anything of that nature.

772
00:59:10,704 --> 00:59:14,074
So, I slowly encouraged him
to explain himself.

773
00:59:14,174 --> 00:59:17,278
He said, he had seen
the jar on the counter,

774
00:59:17,378 --> 00:59:22,659
and the label had said capers,
so clearly, this was not corn.

775
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:25,162
Can you imagine?

776
00:59:25,552 --> 00:59:29,759
- I think what Sarah meant was...
- Would you help me serve? Please.

777
01:00:01,588 --> 01:00:03,524
It's very good.

778
01:00:03,624 --> 01:00:06,337
Great. I'm glad.

779
01:00:09,763 --> 01:00:12,599
You should see if you can try
to get some of this down.

780
01:00:12,699 --> 01:00:14,585
I think you'd like it.

781
01:00:14,735 --> 01:00:17,971
- It has potatoes.
- What is this?

782
01:00:18,071 --> 01:00:21,952
Are you messing with us or something?
Why did you bring us here?

783
01:00:23,043 --> 01:00:26,247
I thought we would enjoy
our dinner first, Bram.

784
01:00:26,347 --> 01:00:29,626
Well, excuse me if I have
other things on my mind.

785
01:00:30,183 --> 01:00:31,985
Can you help us or not?

786
01:00:32,085 --> 01:00:36,066
What? What was that about all
your other patient?

787
01:00:37,358 --> 01:00:40,428
He had seen the capers,
and he had seen the corn,

788
01:00:40,528 --> 01:00:44,598
and his mind was not in a place
to differentiate the two.

789
01:00:44,698 --> 01:00:48,369
You are visited by a creature
calling itself God...

790
01:00:48,769 --> 01:00:51,038
and all that you have
allowed yourself to do in response

791
01:00:51,138 --> 01:00:55,476
is to discern whether those visitations
are real or imagined.

792
01:00:55,576 --> 01:00:58,445
Is there anything incorrect
in what I'm saying?

793
01:00:58,545 --> 01:00:59,646
No.

794
01:00:59,746 --> 01:01:02,616
Real... imagined.

795
01:01:02,716 --> 01:01:04,785
Two options.

796
01:01:04,885 --> 01:01:08,222
But, as I see it,
strictly according to the data,

797
01:01:08,322 --> 01:01:12,359
there is a third option, an option
which you have yet to fully explore,

798
01:01:12,459 --> 01:01:17,063
an option which in my opinion
as a man of faith and a man of medicine

799
01:01:17,163 --> 01:01:21,428
potentially holds the most
validity of all three.

800
01:01:22,636 --> 01:01:24,935
Which is what?

801
01:01:26,106 --> 01:01:29,877
That you are indeed commanded by a spirit.

802
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:32,146
A supernatural being.

803
01:01:32,246 --> 01:01:35,544
But not the heavenly father.
Not our God who art in heaven.

804
01:01:35,644 --> 01:01:37,885
Something else.

805
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:41,989
You described this being
as enveloped in light, did you not?

806
01:01:42,589 --> 01:01:46,193
Well, then, don't see what you believe.

807

He's sleeping like a log.

895
01:08:54,454 --> 01:08:56,927
He's gotten up two, three times a night
as long as I've known him,

896
01:08:57,027 --> 01:08:59,359
but for the past few weeks
he's slept straight through

898
01:09:02,095 --> 01:09:05,699

since he was a teenager.

Long after I'd become a man...

1050
01:22:27,499 --> 01:22:31,807
after he had passed away.
And it became a kind of story, you know.

1051
01:22:32,838 --> 01:22:34,874
My father, that old so and so.

1052
01:22:34,974 --> 01:22:38,946
You know what he did to me
when I was just a kid?

1053
01:22:39,278 --> 01:22:43,216
And one day I was telling
that story to friends...

1054
01:22:43,816 --> 01:22:47,553
and I, uh, finished...

1055
01:22:47,653 --> 01:22:51,942
with my usual flourish
of incredulity, and...

1056
01:22:52,742 --> 01:22:56,238
waited for the chorus of sympathy...

1057
01:22:57,496 --> 01:23:01,501
and a man at the far end of the table...

1058
01:23:02,001 --> 01:23:04,737
asked me when did this happen.

1059
01:23:04,837 --> 01:23:07,440
And I told him the year,
and he pulled up his pants leg

1060
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:11,186
and he showed me a scar
like you would not believe.

1061
01:23:12,378 --> 01:23:14,318
Those skates...

1062
01:23:14,668 --> 01:23:18,177
had been recalled that year
because they had faulty wheels.

1063
01:23:20,052 --> 01:23:22,465
My father never told me that.

1064
01:23:24,023 --> 01:23:28,671
He did what was in
my best interest and he knew it.

1065
01:23:30,563 --> 01:23:32,825
And that was enough.
