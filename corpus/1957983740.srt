I have your face tattooed
on my back. Well, look at that.

193

Jack, for fuck's sake,
I've been trying you all week.

194

me back? [speaking Italian]

Hey, Charlie. How's the missus?

197
00:12:07,535 --> 00:12:09,737
I think she left me.
Hey, me too! Congrats!

198
00:12:09,872 --> 00:12:11,874
Are you okay with March 17th
for the premiere?

199
00:12:12,006 --> 00:12:13,674
No, 18th. Thursdays
are always classier.

200
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:16,611
Hey, send Charlie a bottle of
bourbon and get ahold of his negative

201
00:12:16,744 --> 00:12:19,547

too shiny. Yes, Mr. Conrad.

202

This table only has one bottle,
and we're gonna need eight.

211
00:12:44,238 --> 00:12:45,706
We're also gonna need
two gin rickeys,

Lillet with a dash of absinthe.

216
00:12:57,418 --> 00:12:59,720
Okay. Two gin rickeys,
uh, three French...

217
00:12:59,855 --> 00:13:02,557
You didn't have to do that,
you know, to get my attention.

218
00:13:06,127 --> 00:13:07,495
I am so sorry, Mr. Conrad.

219
00:13:07,628 --> 00:13:08,931
I want... What's your name?

220
00:13:09,697 --> 00:13:13,434
Jen. I just wanted you
to look my way.

221
00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:17,238
Jen, I'd always look your way.

won't come out of the car.

off the nearest cliff.

224
00:13:27,816 --> 00:13:28,850
Right.

225
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,718
Be right back.

After all we've been through.

228
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:41,262
Well, to be fair, George, you
did just meet her a week ago.

You've never done cocaine?

243
00:14:19,635 --> 00:14:21,838
[scoffs]
Of course I've done cocaine.

244
00:14:21,971 --> 00:14:24,974
Well? I do cocaine
all the time. I just, uh...

245

Okay, I'll do a little.
Whatever. [chuckles]

I don't know,
maybe Niagara Falls.

249
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,752
You know, "Roy," actually,
in French, means "king."

250
00:14:36,886 --> 00:14:39,755
And I added the "La,"
so it's "Nellie the King."

251
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:41,156
I made that up.

252
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:43,659
What about you? Where
would you go? Sorry?

I don't know. Um...

00:14:53,535 --> 00:14:55,437
I always wanted to go
on a movie set.

257

Yeah? Yeah. A movie set.

00:14:57,807 --> 00:14:59,508
Tell me why.

I don't know why.
I wanna go on a movie set too.

262
00:15:05,882 --> 00:15:10,086
Why? I just want to be part
of something bigger, I guess.

263
00:15:10,218 --> 00:15:11,553
Bigger than what?

264
00:15:12,254 --> 00:15:13,689
Bigger than this.

265
00:15:13,823 --> 00:15:16,358
Bigger than my life. Bigger
than scooping elephant shit.

266
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:18,360
Bigger. Better. Important.

267
00:15:18,493 --> 00:15:21,164
Something important. To be
part of something important.

268
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,298
Something that lasts,
that means something.

269

Making movies. I want
to go on a movie set too.

Or at least I want to be there,
work there, learn there. I don't know.

You sit there.

And you're watching the
movie and... And you escape.

in your own shitty fucking life.

You can be in their life.

and people die in movies.

know. Movies are sad sometimes.

Movies are fucking happy.
They make you feel something.

[rhythmic chanting]

351
00:22:09,271 --> 00:22:11,739
You! I've been looking
all over for you.

352
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:13,843
We got a serious
fucking situation.

353
00:22:13,976 --> 00:22:16,579
There's no exit except
down the main staircase.

354
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:18,180
Nothing in the back? No.

355
00:22:18,314 --> 00:22:20,682
You gotta go through the
ballroom. Everyone will see her.

356
00:22:20,816 --> 00:22:22,918
Is there a doctor? No.

357
00:22:23,052 --> 00:22:25,054
They're all high down there.
Maybe they won't care.

358
00:22:25,187 --> 00:22:27,857
If we take her out now...
Somebody will care!

359
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,926
She's a fucking kid,
and she looks like she's dead.

360
00:22:36,698 --> 00:22:38,100
We use the elephant.

361
00:22:42,037 --> 00:22:43,339
We bring him through the front.

362
00:22:43,472 --> 00:22:47,009
Everyone will look at him.
No one will look at her.

363
00:22:50,212 --> 00:22:52,348
It's only 2:00.
Don wanted to save the elephant.

364
00:22:54,484 --> 00:22:56,186
Fine. Get the wrangler.

365
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:59,589
Jimmy, you carry the girl with me.
Then you drive her to the hospital.

366
00:22:59,722 --> 00:23:02,325
Doubt she'll be able to work
tomorrow. That's her fucking problem.

367
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:04,895
No. She's in the bar scene
in <i>Maid's Off.</i>

368
00:23:09,732 --> 00:23:12,035
Yeah. Jane Thornton, that's her.

369
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:14,104
Bar shoots tomorrow, doesn't it?

370
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,906
Yes.

371
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,243
[shouts]
Who the fuck invited her?

372
00:23:21,211 --> 00:23:22,345
[guest] Um...

373
00:23:23,446 --> 00:23:24,747
I did.

374
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:27,050
You blimp motherfucker,
piece of fat fucking shit!

375
00:23:27,184 --> 00:23:29,152
It was her first film.
She wanted to celebrate.

376
00:23:29,286 --> 00:23:31,054
I'll fucking... You doughboy!

377
00:23:31,188 --> 00:23:33,323
You fuckhead motherfucking
Humpty Dumpty! [grunting, screaming]

378
00:23:33,456 --> 00:23:35,659
Bob, come on! Bob!
I'm gonna cut you up!

379
00:23:35,792 --> 00:23:38,328
No, Bob! Don't leave me! Fuck!

380
00:23:38,461 --> 00:23:40,230

383
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,974
Her.

384
00:23:51,107 --> 00:23:53,843
Whoever she is.
We go with her tomorrow.

385
00:24:02,152 --> 00:24:03,687
[elephant trumpeting]
[all clamoring]

386
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,355
[guest] What the fuck?

387
00:24:07,357 --> 00:24:10,227

00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:23,300
Yeah. All right, <i>Kapitän.</i>

399
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:27,771
Just one more drink
for old time's sake.

400
00:25:27,904 --> 00:25:29,139
Sir?

401
00:25:30,173 --> 00:25:33,143
I just want to say
thank you for the work.

402
00:25:33,276 --> 00:25:37,013
And I was wondering
if perhaps, next time,

403
00:25:37,147 --> 00:25:41,951
you or Mr. Wallach might
have something for me on a set?

404
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:44,487
I'll do anything.

405
00:25:44,621 --> 00:25:47,090
I can paint, I can cook,
I can clean, I can do coffee...

406
00:25:47,223 --> 00:25:49,326
You're where you belong.

407
00:25:53,697 --> 00:25:55,198
Okay. Thank you.

408
00:25:56,232 --> 00:25:58,635
[Nellie]
Ooh. I'm gonna raise you.

409
00:26:00,103 --> 00:26:03,940
[Jimmy] You need to be on set in
three hours. You'd better get some sleep.

410
00:26:04,741 --> 00:26:06,343
[laughs]

411
00:26:06,476 --> 00:26:08,678
Gentlemen.
You have a good night, Nellie.

412
00:26:08,813 --> 00:26:09,879
[poker player] Congratulations.

413
00:26:10,013 --> 00:26:11,247
[Nellie squeals]

414
00:26:11,381 --> 00:26:12,916
Manny!

415
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,884
Ain't life grand?

416
00:26:15,018 --> 00:26:16,920
[laughing]

417
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:24,027
[screams]

418
00:26:25,195 --> 00:26:27,430
Oh, if they could see me now!

419
00:26:27,564 --> 00:26:33,069
All the cunts in Lafayette called me
the ugliest mutt in the neighborhood.

420
00:26:33,203 --> 00:26:35,840
Well, let them see me now!

421
00:26:35,972 --> 00:26:38,174
Can you believe this, Manny?

422
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:41,878
Hey, Josie! Hey, Nana!

423
00:26:42,011 --> 00:26:46,784
Why don't you kiss
my royal Angeleno hooch?

424
00:26:46,916 --> 00:26:48,151
Nellie.

00:27:05,168 --> 00:27:06,503
Night night, honey.

[crashes]

431
00:27:09,672 --> 00:27:10,940
Don't worry about that.

432
00:27:11,074 --> 00:27:13,009
The car is not mine.

433
00:27:26,756 --> 00:27:29,092
Chico. Hey, Chico!

434
00:27:30,393 --> 00:27:31,995
Jack Conrad's passed out.

435
00:27:32,128 --> 00:27:34,297
Use one of Wallach's cars
to take him home.

436
00:27:52,115 --> 00:27:55,318
Señor? Sir? Uh, do
you have keys? [grunts]

437
00:27:55,452 --> 00:27:58,421
Yeah. I have keys.

Damn it. [door opens]

00:28:17,207 --> 00:28:19,442
Ah, <i>musica. Musica?</i>

444
00:28:19,576 --> 00:28:20,510
Huh?

445
00:28:20,643 --> 00:28:21,779

[singing along in Italian]

449
00:28:28,318 --> 00:28:32,455
Imagine me at the opera? That
would've made Ina's folks happy.

450
00:28:33,556 --> 00:28:34,792
[sighs]

451
00:28:34,925 --> 00:28:36,726
[music continues playing]

452
00:28:36,861 --> 00:28:38,528
Well, if you'll excuse me...

456
00:28:46,736 --> 00:28:48,538
See my point? Come on.

457
00:28:48,671 --> 00:28:51,140
[singing in Italian]

458
00:28:52,075 --> 00:28:53,710
Ina's mom always said,

459
00:28:53,844 --> 00:28:56,613
"I don't see how you can marry
someone who paints his face."

460
00:29:05,121 --> 00:29:06,756
You know what we gotta do?

461
00:29:08,993 --> 00:29:11,829
We gotta redefine the form.

462
00:29:11,962 --> 00:29:16,901
The man who puts gasoline in
your tank goes to the movies why?

463
00:29:17,033 --> 00:29:18,903
Why? Why?

464
00:29:19,035 --> 00:29:21,638
Because he feels
less alone there.

465
00:29:22,806 --> 00:29:25,542
Don't we owe him more
than the same old shit?

466
00:29:25,675 --> 00:29:28,244
You got the guys in Europe
with the twelve-tone.

467
00:29:28,378 --> 00:29:31,514
You got Bauhaus architecture.
Fucking Bauhaus, you know?

468
00:29:31,648 --> 00:29:34,551
And we're still doing
costume pictures?

469
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:38,321
It's the dinosaurs, kid.

470
00:29:39,355 --> 00:29:41,090
It's the ones
who go to Beverly Hills

471
00:29:41,224 --> 00:29:43,159
for meatballs and mint juleps

472
00:29:43,293 --> 00:29:45,395
to reminisce about the old days,

473
00:29:45,528 --> 00:29:49,465
when they can't see
there's so much more to be done!

[blows]

475
00:29:52,702 --> 00:29:55,705
We've got to innovate.
We've got to inspire.

476
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,475
We got to dream beyond these
pesky shells of flesh and bone.

477
00:29:59,609 --> 00:30:03,513
Map those dreams onto celluloid
and print them into history.

478
00:30:03,646 --> 00:30:07,216
Turn today into tomorrow
so that tomorrow's lonely man

479
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:09,285
may look up
at that flickering screen

480
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:12,056
and say for the very first time,

481
00:30:12,188 --> 00:30:15,325
"Eureka! I am not alone!"

482
00:30:16,192 --> 00:30:17,694

You need something?

Yeah, I like you. I want
you to take me to set today.

496

I want you by my side.

<i>Sí.</i>

499
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:19,355
You ever been
on a movie set before?

500

No.

501
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:24,727
You'll see.

502
00:31:25,762 --> 00:31:28,799
It's the most magical place
in the world.

528
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:19,436
[crew member] Higher! More!

529
00:34:22,106 --> 00:34:24,675

[shouting ferociously]

532
00:34:31,883 --> 00:34:34,953
Now go over, put it in the pot.
Scream like a big, fat pig.

533
00:34:35,086 --> 00:34:37,021
All right. All right,
all right! Yes!

534
00:34:37,155 --> 00:34:38,388
Go!

535
00:34:39,123 --> 00:34:43,360

536
00:34:46,197 --> 00:34:48,099

[shouting]

539
00:34:56,473 --> 00:34:58,508
More whiskey! More whiskey!

540
00:34:58,642 --> 00:35:01,946
Well, don't just fucking stand
there! Get the fuck out of the shot!

541
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,782
[playing jazz]

542
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,418
[camel grunts]

543
00:35:10,822 --> 00:35:14,558
Peanuts! Good for hangovers!

544
00:35:14,691 --> 00:35:16,928
You. You're new?
You're new here?

545
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:18,897
Your first bag is free.

546
00:35:22,633 --> 00:35:26,137
One bag or two? One. And
you're paying this time? Thank you.

547
00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:27,504
Hurry the fuck up!

548
00:35:27,638 --> 00:35:29,807
Can you stop drinking?
We are not shooting yet!

549
00:35:29,941 --> 00:35:31,943
Put down the fucking glasses!

550
00:35:34,078 --> 00:35:36,247
Who the fuck is this? I
asked for the girl with the tits.

551
00:35:36,381 --> 00:35:38,049
This is who they found.

552
00:35:39,017 --> 00:35:40,952
What happened to the tits part?

553
00:35:41,085 --> 00:35:42,686
She OD'd.

554
00:35:44,322 --> 00:35:46,057
[groans loudly]

555
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:54,198
Just go. Just go.
Get her made up.

556
00:35:55,066 --> 00:35:56,267
Max! Yes.

557
00:35:56,401 --> 00:35:57,567
Just, uh, shoot the men
or something.

558
00:35:57,701 --> 00:35:59,137
No tits? No tits.

559
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,839
All right, no tits, everybody!
We're shooting the men.

560
00:36:01,973 --> 00:36:05,009
[director] <i>Diese Scheißen</i> fucks!
They are ruining my movie!

561
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,845
I want them on camera
in five minutes!

562
00:36:07,979 --> 00:36:09,881
Otto, please, please.
Jack's arriving.

563
00:36:10,014 --> 00:36:11,581
[tires screech]

564
00:36:11,715 --> 00:36:13,318
What about pancakes?

565
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,920
Do you heat the syrup or do you
let the pancake do the warming?

566
00:36:16,054 --> 00:36:19,489
[groans] Heat the syrup?
I agree!

567
00:36:19,623 --> 00:36:21,458
Ha. That there is George Munn,

568
00:36:21,591 --> 00:36:24,862
best producer in the biz
and my oldest pal.

569
00:36:24,996 --> 00:36:26,931
Set patrol over there
is Jim Kidd.

570
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:30,534
Legend of the Wild West who
made his name killing Apaches.

571
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:32,337
Lives in Brentwood now.
[Otto] This is bullshit!

572
00:36:32,469 --> 00:36:35,273
Georgie, what's up Von
Cheeseburger's ass today? [sighs]

573
00:36:35,406 --> 00:36:38,575
The extras want to renegotiate
their pay... you motherfucker!

574
00:36:38,709 --> 00:36:40,744
Huh. I do not care if
the extras are revolting!

575
00:36:40,878 --> 00:36:42,880
Well, put the kid on it.

576
00:36:43,014 --> 00:36:45,383
The kid? Yeah, the kid.
The Mexican I brought.

577
00:36:45,515 --> 00:36:47,251
He's great. What's your name?

578
00:36:47,385 --> 00:36:49,287
Me? Manuel. [Otto] Bullshit!

579
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:52,390
Right, Manuel. Manuel's
great! Put Manuel on it.

580
00:36:52,522 --> 00:36:54,459
You have experience
with strikes?

581
00:36:54,591 --> 00:36:57,095
Um... yes.

582
00:36:57,627 --> 00:36:58,796
Okay, good.

583
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,465
Well, these are all junkies
from Skid Row,

584
00:37:00,597 --> 00:37:02,632
so they're pretty violent.
[Otto] ...you fucking assholes!

585
00:37:03,734 --> 00:37:05,003
Who are you?

586
00:37:05,136 --> 00:37:07,405
That's the cocksucker
they sent to screw us!

587
00:37:07,537 --> 00:37:11,109
Gentlemen, I believe
you all agreed to a day's work.

588
00:37:11,242 --> 00:37:14,812
And I believe I agreed to
ram this knife up the asshole

589
00:37:14,946 --> 00:37:17,348
of the first faggot
they sent over!

590
00:37:17,482 --> 00:37:19,583
[strikers cheering]
[speaking Spanish]

591
00:37:19,716 --> 00:37:22,420
This is where you kiss
the apparition, <i>ja?</i>

592
00:37:22,552 --> 00:37:23,855
<i>Ja.</i>

593
00:37:23,988 --> 00:37:25,823
She has led you to
your destiny through fate,

594
00:37:25,957 --> 00:37:28,625
through your lifetime to
this moment, <i>ja?</i> Mm-hmm.

595
00:37:28,759 --> 00:37:30,194
Very good, <i>ja? Ja.</i>

596
00:37:30,328 --> 00:37:32,430
I'm gonna play it adagio.

597
00:37:32,562 --> 00:37:35,900
You know, for the music
and the poetry.

598
00:37:36,034 --> 00:37:38,036
All art aspires to music.

599
00:37:38,169 --> 00:37:39,504
I like it. Yeah.

600
00:37:39,636 --> 00:37:41,239
Sandwich!

601
00:37:41,372 --> 00:37:42,907
What is this dolly doing here?

602
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:45,943
[strikers shouting angrily]

603
00:37:46,077 --> 00:37:48,612
Sir! Sir, sir!
Sir, can I borrow that?

604
00:37:48,745 --> 00:37:51,149
[gunshot] [Manuel] All
right, you motherfuckers!

605
00:37:51,282 --> 00:37:55,520
Any of you don't work gets
a bullet in the fucking skull!

606
00:37:55,652 --> 00:37:56,720
[gunfire]

607
00:37:56,854 --> 00:37:59,157
Get back to work!
Get back to work!

608
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,958
Get back to work!

609
00:38:01,092 --> 00:38:02,493
[muffled] Manuel's great!

610
00:38:02,626 --> 00:38:04,262
How's that for camera?
Much better, Ruth.

611
00:38:04,395 --> 00:38:05,530
Jesus Christ!

612
00:38:05,662 --> 00:38:07,697
Is somebody gonna fix her face?

613
00:38:07,832 --> 00:38:09,400
Get her out of here!
Fuck's sake.

614
00:38:09,534 --> 00:38:11,701
Do you not know how to do
makeup? You, what's your name?

615
00:38:11,836 --> 00:38:13,137
Tim. Tim, you're fired.

616
00:38:13,271 --> 00:38:15,039
What? You heard her!
Get the fuck off this set!

617
00:38:16,207 --> 00:38:18,076
[Otto] Action!

"Marbled meadows metamorphose

Soldiers swarm the fields

Oh, why do I bother?

H-He's dead.

643
00:40:39,051 --> 00:40:41,320
He did have a drinking problem.

644
00:40:41,954 --> 00:40:43,589
[George] That's true.

645
00:40:43,721 --> 00:40:46,225
Probably ran into it
himself, huh?

646
00:40:46,825 --> 00:40:48,460
It's a disease.

[Jack] Close with Swanson
and the fireworks. The end!

651
00:41:09,281 --> 00:41:10,949
Irv! For the Clayton movie...

652
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:12,884
Sir, I-I think your tent's
in the line of fire.

653
00:41:13,018 --> 00:41:15,487
They'll edit it out in post.
But I think we could get hurt...

654
00:41:15,621 --> 00:41:17,789
[explosion] Jack, every time you
wear a prosthetic, we lose money.

655
00:41:17,923 --> 00:41:20,092
Don't be a pussy, Irv. The
fireworks shot is too expensive.

656
00:41:20,225 --> 00:41:22,160
And you'll never get Gloria
Swanson. Why no Swanson?

657
00:41:22,294 --> 00:41:23,829
She only does leads.
She's on the phone, sir.

658
00:41:23,962 --> 00:41:24,930
Thanks, Abby. Who?

659
00:41:25,063 --> 00:41:26,331
Gloria Swanson. What?

660
00:41:26,465 --> 00:41:29,668
Gloria? Jack Conrad.
Listen, I need some advice.

661
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:31,603
You know all
the young up-and-comers.

662
00:41:31,737 --> 00:41:35,240
Well, I need a real discovery for the
part in my movie. Who do you suggest?

663
00:41:35,374 --> 00:41:37,743
Why discovery? Well,
this role requires real range.

664
00:41:37,876 --> 00:41:41,079
A range I just don't see in
any of today's stars... [screams]

665
00:41:41,213 --> 00:41:42,547
Excuse me.

666
00:41:42,681 --> 00:41:47,052
Props needs better aging,
goddamn it! We talked about this!

667
00:41:47,185 --> 00:41:49,221
Sorry, what... No, I didn't...

668
00:41:49,354 --> 00:41:51,223
Gloria, you have
buckets of charm.

669
00:41:51,356 --> 00:41:54,726
This is real drama we're talking
about. Shakespeare-level stuff.

670
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,162
Hmm. Of course
you could do Shakespeare.

671
00:41:57,296 --> 00:42:00,699
You would be spectacular
in one of his fluffier plays.

672
00:42:01,633 --> 00:42:04,369
Gloria, you're taking this
the wrong way.

673
00:42:04,503 --> 00:42:07,306
Well, I'd like to work
with you too.

674
00:42:07,439 --> 00:42:10,075
No, I'm afraid it's impossible.
It's gotta be a discovery.

675
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:14,146
We couldn't afford star fees
even if we wanted to.

676
00:42:14,279 --> 00:42:15,881
Really? Huh.

677
00:42:16,014 --> 00:42:18,850
Well, how about
I talk it over with the studio?

678
00:42:18,984 --> 00:42:22,688
I can't speak for them,
of course, but I'll do my best.

679
00:42:22,821 --> 00:42:25,223
Okay, then. Bye now.

680
00:42:25,357 --> 00:42:26,158
[hangs up]

681
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:28,093
She'll do it for cheap.

682
00:42:28,226 --> 00:42:32,230
Now take the money I saved you and
put it towards the goddamn fireworks shot.

683
00:42:33,398 --> 00:42:34,801
Cut!

684
00:42:34,933 --> 00:42:37,436
[screams] These fucking horses!

685
00:42:37,569 --> 00:42:38,603
Motherfuckers!

686
00:42:38,737 --> 00:42:39,838
[grunts] Is that the last one?

687
00:42:39,971 --> 00:42:41,773
What happened?
We lost all ten cameras.

688
00:42:41,907 --> 00:42:44,309
But what about Jack's scene?
We make a camera run right now!

689
00:42:44,443 --> 00:42:46,011
It's too far!
Sun sets in three hours!

690
00:42:46,144 --> 00:42:47,446
Send Joey now. Tell him
to speed. In the meantime...

691
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:49,782
Joey has a flag sticking
through his chest, Larry.

692
00:42:49,915 --> 00:42:51,616
A flag? He ran into it himself.

693
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,852
Right. Um, send Miguel then.

694
00:42:59,124 --> 00:43:01,193
Here. 1312 Cahuenga.

695
00:43:01,326 --> 00:43:04,429
You give 'em that card,
you tell 'em you work for Munn.

696
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:05,864
And hurry!

697
00:43:05,997 --> 00:43:07,566
Okay, here's the shot.

698
00:43:08,767 --> 00:43:11,636
Flirt with the men. Dance.
Get up on the table and that's it.

699
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:14,306
Just, uh, don't look at the
fucking camera. Places!

700
00:43:14,439 --> 00:43:16,942
[crew member] And camera!
[camera clattering]

701
00:43:27,787 --> 00:43:28,920
[Ruth] And music!

702
00:43:29,054 --> 00:43:32,290
[up-tempo jazz playing]

703
00:43:34,092 --> 00:43:35,460
[Ruth] Action!

704
00:43:35,594 --> 00:43:36,995
Hi, boys.

705
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:40,932
Santa, get me wet.

706
00:43:49,207 --> 00:43:51,109
Another, please.

707
00:43:56,748 --> 00:43:59,819
That one's for you,
snuggle pup. [chuckling]

708
00:43:59,951 --> 00:44:01,453
Hey, baby grand.

709
00:44:02,521 --> 00:44:03,588
[grunting]

710
00:44:03,722 --> 00:44:05,390
[chuckles]

711
00:44:05,524 --> 00:44:07,259
Where are you going?

712
00:44:10,095 --> 00:44:12,097
Uh... okay,
start dancing, please.

713
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,166
[music continues]

714
00:44:20,505 --> 00:44:21,640
Bauhaus.

715
00:44:21,773 --> 00:44:23,843
You know what I mean
by Bauhaus, don't you?

716
00:44:23,975 --> 00:44:26,278
Not as it relates
to this, sir, no.

717
00:44:40,425 --> 00:44:42,160
[cheering]

718
00:44:46,264 --> 00:44:49,534
And then he says,
<i>"Hasta la vista,</i> motherfucker."

719
00:44:49,668 --> 00:44:50,602
Type it.

720
00:44:50,735 --> 00:44:54,072
[cheering, whistling]

721
00:44:55,974 --> 00:44:57,209

723
00:45:10,422 --> 00:45:11,556
[shouts]

724
00:45:15,427 --> 00:45:18,463
And then he says, "Frankly,
Scarlett, you're a cunt."

725
00:45:18,597 --> 00:45:19,631
Type it.

726
00:45:25,938 --> 00:45:27,038
[glass shattering]

727
00:45:31,409 --> 00:45:32,477
Cut!

728
00:45:33,044 --> 00:45:35,213
[brakes squealing]

729
00:45:35,347 --> 00:45:37,249
Man number three,
I can see your erection.

730
00:45:37,382 --> 00:45:38,951
All right, tuck it.
Just tuck it up.

731
00:45:39,084 --> 00:45:41,353
[panting]

732
00:45:52,999 --> 00:45:55,033
Hi. I work for Mr. George Munn.

733
00:45:55,166 --> 00:45:56,869
We need a camera
for Strassberger's show.

734
00:45:57,003 --> 00:45:58,905
Oh, yeah? What kind of camera?

735
00:45:59,037 --> 00:46:01,139
Bell and Howell 35 millimeter.

736
00:46:02,307 --> 00:46:06,545
Uh-huh.
Is it a 2708 model or 2709?

737
00:46:08,246 --> 00:46:11,082
I-I'm not sure.
Is there a big difference?

738
00:46:15,053 --> 00:46:16,822
Um, yeah.

739
00:46:17,289 --> 00:46:18,791
Hey, Donny!

740
00:46:18,925 --> 00:46:21,259
What? There's a guy
up here wants to know

741
00:46:21,393 --> 00:46:25,697
if there's a big difference between
a 2708 and a 2709. [chuckling]

742
00:46:25,831 --> 00:46:27,833
Okay. [Donny guffawing]

743
00:46:27,967 --> 00:46:30,268
Do you have either? Nope.

744
00:46:30,402 --> 00:46:32,370
Every camera's
been loaned out. Fuck.

745
00:46:32,504 --> 00:46:34,874
One's coming back
in half an hour though.

746
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,975
Half hour?

747
00:46:36,107 --> 00:46:37,977
But it's a 2709.

748
00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:39,110
Yeah. Okay.

749
00:46:39,244 --> 00:46:40,612
Thirty minutes.

750
00:46:40,745 --> 00:46:43,615
For the 2709. I can
do that. Thirty minutes.

751
00:46:43,748 --> 00:46:45,450
Two-seven... Okay.

752
00:46:45,584 --> 00:46:47,319
...zero-nine.

753
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:51,156
[clock ticking]

754
00:47:07,706 --> 00:47:09,274
Are you married?

755
00:47:09,407 --> 00:47:12,510
My wife died.
Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry.

756
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,782
Hey! Next part.
Miss Moore'll come in.

757
00:47:16,916 --> 00:47:19,517
She saved you from prostitution,
so when you see her, cry in shame.

758
00:47:19,651 --> 00:47:22,520
I need big tears! Big!
You got it? Okay, yeah.

759
00:47:23,588 --> 00:47:25,290
Is that gum?

760
00:47:25,423 --> 00:47:27,392
Are you fucking kidding me?
What's wrong with you?

761
00:47:27,525 --> 00:47:30,195
Five-minute warning
for Miss Moore!

762
00:47:42,641 --> 00:47:45,276
[door opens] [car horn honks]

763
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:46,611
That's mine!

764
00:47:46,745 --> 00:47:48,781
I have 20 minutes
to be in Simi Valley.

765
00:47:48,914 --> 00:47:52,384
Which road do I take? Uh, you're
gonna look at least 90 in this traffic.

766
00:47:52,517 --> 00:47:57,355
We've got an eight-part sign-out
process. Let me go try to find a pen.

767
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:02,862
Action!

768
00:48:02,995 --> 00:48:05,230
[up-tempo jazz playing]
And action, Miss Moore.

769
00:48:05,363 --> 00:48:07,133
Hand on chest. Aghast! [gasps]

770
00:48:07,265 --> 00:48:08,633
My goodness,
what is going on here?

771
00:48:08,767 --> 00:48:10,602
Girl on bar, look at Miss Moore.

772
00:48:10,735 --> 00:48:12,237
And tears!

773
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:15,607
[whispers] Okay, glycerin.

774
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:18,044
Um, we seem to be out.
What? We haven't used any.

775
00:48:18,176 --> 00:48:19,444
Porky thought it was lube.

776
00:48:19,577 --> 00:48:20,813
He thought it was lube? Yes.

777
00:48:20,946 --> 00:48:22,747
[Ruth] Are you
fucking... She can't cry.

778
00:48:22,882 --> 00:48:24,749
She's just some random whore
from Wallach's house! [sobs]

779
00:48:26,852 --> 00:48:28,753
[crying]

780
00:48:44,736 --> 00:48:45,938
Cut.

781
00:48:46,072 --> 00:48:47,439
[sobs, stops]

782
00:48:48,107 --> 00:48:50,709
Hiya. I'm Nellie LaRoy.

783
00:48:51,376 --> 00:48:53,012
So we going again?

784
00:48:53,145 --> 00:48:54,379
Fucking motherfucker.

785
00:48:54,512 --> 00:48:55,848
I'm so sorry, God.

786
00:48:55,981 --> 00:48:58,416
You gave us the beautiful light,
and I squandered it.

787
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:00,019
I won't have
any fucking light now.

788
00:49:00,152 --> 00:49:03,089
Otto, you should have fought
for 20 cameras, you idiot!

789
00:49:03,221 --> 00:49:05,724
[siren wailing]

790
00:49:05,858 --> 00:49:07,059
What is this bullshit?

791
00:49:07,193 --> 00:49:10,428
[siren wailing continues]

792
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:17,402
[siren stops] Camera! Camera!

793
00:49:17,535 --> 00:49:18,904
Camera! Yeah.

794
00:49:19,038 --> 00:49:20,605
Camera! Camera! Yeah.

795
00:49:20,739 --> 00:49:22,875
My camera's here!
My camera's here!

796
00:49:23,008 --> 00:49:25,077
We roll, we roll!
We are losing the light!

797
00:49:25,211 --> 00:49:27,046
[Ruth] Take two! Action!

798
00:49:27,179 --> 00:49:28,748
[gasps] And cry.

799
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,518
Cut! Okay, I want to
try something. [grunts]

800
00:49:32,651 --> 00:49:34,955
Think you could hold for
two beats for tears gushing?

801
00:49:35,088 --> 00:49:37,157
Eyes water for two, on the third
beat, I'm gonna do a light effect.

802
00:49:37,289 --> 00:49:39,658
That's when you gush. Water
for two, gush on three. Yep.

803
00:49:39,793 --> 00:49:42,528
Yes. Okay, let's do it!
Ruth, any notes on my entrance?

804
00:49:45,098 --> 00:49:46,332
You're fine.

805
00:49:54,174 --> 00:49:55,976
Ready for you, Mr. Conrad.

806
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,947
[Ruth] Action! [gasps]

807
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,916
Eyes water.

808
00:50:03,049 --> 00:50:04,985
Light. And tears!

809
00:50:05,118 --> 00:50:06,585
[sobs]

810
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,620
Cut!

811
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,727
Okay. Forgive the ask.
This is nuts.

812
00:50:14,861 --> 00:50:17,831
But could you, by any chance,
try the same thing with less tears?

813
00:50:17,964 --> 00:50:19,365
One tear or two?

814
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:33,546
Let's do this.

815
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:37,217
'Twas brillig
and the slithy toves were...

816

817
00:50:39,418 --> 00:50:42,155
Oh, hey. Come with.

818
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:45,091
Camera's up the hill,
Mr. Conrad. Over here?

819
00:50:45,225 --> 00:50:46,793
There? Yeah.

820
00:50:47,994 --> 00:50:48,929
We'd better hurry.

821
00:50:49,062 --> 00:50:50,797
[grunts]

822
00:50:56,102 --> 00:50:57,503

824
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,512
There? Okay.

825
00:51:06,645 --> 00:51:08,547
[Otto]
Ah, my beautiful baby boy.

826
00:51:08,681 --> 00:51:10,116
Come, come. Okay, right here.

827
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:13,220
Now remember, you are sad
and lonely man. Right here.

828
00:51:13,352 --> 00:51:16,589
No one will ever love you but her,
and she's only in your head, okay?

829
00:51:16,722 --> 00:51:18,792
[crew member] Last looks!
Do I know her?

830
00:51:19,491 --> 00:51:22,262
[Otto] No. She's in your head!

831
00:51:22,394 --> 00:51:24,231
No, no! No last looks!
No last looks!

832
00:51:24,363 --> 00:51:27,366
Get the fuck out! I'll fucking
kill you! We are losing the light!

833
00:51:27,499 --> 00:51:28,767
We roll now! We roll!

00:51:28,902 --> 00:51:31,137
Roll, roll, roll, roll.

838
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,342
[Ruth] Action! [gasps]

839
00:52:10,076 --> 00:52:11,644
[crew] Oh, my God, it's a fire!

840
00:52:11,777 --> 00:52:13,545
Everyone, run! Run!

841
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:16,816
Don't stop the camera!
Keep rolling! Keep rolling!

842
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:18,385
Single tear!

843
00:52:18,517 --> 00:52:21,054
[people screaming]

844
00:52:21,187 --> 00:52:23,089
Cannon! Cannon!

[gunshot] [sizzling]

846
00:52:27,426 --> 00:52:28,661
More crying!

847
00:52:28,795 --> 00:52:31,563
Now laugh in
embarrassment. [laughing]

848
00:52:31,697 --> 00:52:33,934
Now look at Miss Moore.

849
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:36,702
You're trying to hide the shame.

850
00:52:37,603 --> 00:52:39,172
Hold steady. What the...

851
00:52:39,306 --> 00:52:41,540
You're trying to be strong.

852
00:52:41,674 --> 00:52:44,643
You're trying to bury the pain.

853
00:52:44,777 --> 00:52:50,582
But you can't hold back
that one final tear!

854
00:52:50,716 --> 00:52:53,652
[romantic music playing]

855
00:53:05,497 --> 00:53:08,068

857
00:53:49,442 --> 00:53:51,077
And cut. Cut.

858
00:53:54,347 --> 00:53:56,850
[camera whirring slows, stops]

859
00:53:58,451 --> 00:53:59,386
We got it.

[crew applauding, cheering]

863
00:54:14,401 --> 00:54:15,667
Who the fuck is that?

864
00:54:15,802 --> 00:54:18,570
Camera boy! The camera boy!
You saved my movie!

865
00:54:18,704 --> 00:54:21,875
I love you! I love you!
Yes! Did you see that?

866
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:23,609
Did you see the butterfly?

867
00:54:23,742 --> 00:54:25,145
That was a butterfly.

868
00:54:26,645 --> 00:54:28,580
Who's writing
the titles on this?

869
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:34,788
I gotta ask you something.
Yeah? Was it okay?

870
00:54:34,921 --> 00:54:37,924
It was incredible!
I just... How do you do it?

871
00:54:38,058 --> 00:54:40,960
Just tear up over and over
like it's nothing?

872
00:54:42,328 --> 00:54:44,097
I just think of home.

873
00:54:46,565 --> 00:54:47,967
[band playing jazz]

874
00:54:48,101 --> 00:54:50,336
[Elinor] So, Jacky boy,
how do you think it turned out?

875
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:53,173
Ah, people want the kiss, we
give them the kiss. [cork pops]

876
00:54:53,306 --> 00:54:55,875
But, madame,
I can't help but wonder,

877
00:54:56,009 --> 00:54:57,944
don't we have a higher calling?

878
00:54:58,078 --> 00:54:59,678
We got a lot of great stuff.

879
00:54:59,813 --> 00:55:02,148
We're really excited about our
new discovery, Nellie LaRoy.

880
00:55:02,282 --> 00:55:04,683
Is she here tonight? Can
you point her out to me? Uh...

881
00:55:04,818 --> 00:55:06,119
[Nellie whooping]

882
00:55:06,252 --> 00:55:08,822
[guests cheering]

883
00:55:08,955 --> 00:55:11,590
Yeah, she's the one having sex
with the ice sculpture.

884
00:55:11,723 --> 00:55:13,493
We're all very fond of her.

885
00:55:13,625 --> 00:55:16,196
[up-tempo jazz playing]

886
00:55:20,033 --> 00:55:23,669
It needs more punch. Take two frames
off the tail and three more off the head.

887
00:55:23,803 --> 00:55:25,238
Manuel. Yes?

888
00:55:25,371 --> 00:55:28,308
I saw Olga Putti sing
to herself in Hungarian,

889
00:55:28,441 --> 00:55:30,043
and I think I'm in love.

890
00:55:30,176 --> 00:55:32,345
Send two dozen roses to her
dressing room every morning this week.

891
00:55:32,479 --> 00:55:35,081
You know she doesn't speak
English? Neither does love.

892
00:55:36,715 --> 00:55:38,118
Let's do a title here.

893
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,953
"I've been in fashion shows too.

894
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:42,021
They voted me the 'Least
Dressed Woman' in Paris."

895
00:55:42,155 --> 00:55:44,023
And when it looks like the guy
asks her something,

896
00:55:44,157 --> 00:55:46,192
have him ask her name
and have her reply,

897
00:55:46,326 --> 00:55:50,063
"No names.
Just call me the wild child."

898
00:55:54,733 --> 00:55:56,970
Do you think
she swings both ways?

899
00:56:21,727 --> 00:56:24,898
You're not on the list. Okay, listen
to me. My name is Nellie LaRoy.

900
00:56:25,031 --> 00:56:27,066
Still not on the list.
Lady, I'm in the movie.

901
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,836
They clearly cut you, baby.
Is that snakeskin?

902
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:31,971
Oh, my God! Nellie LaRoy!
Can I have an autograph?

903
00:56:32,105 --> 00:56:34,007
I once fought a rattlesnake,

904
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,075
and it's against the law to even deal
with a rattlesnake. Gorgeous! Gorgeous!

905
00:56:36,209 --> 00:56:38,744
There are laws now because I
fought the rattlesnake and lived.

906
00:56:38,878 --> 00:56:40,647
Okay. You can go in.

907
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,882
Why, thank you.

Naturally, I always knew
my daughter had it in her.

We're gonna do great things
together, she and I.

914
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:06,232
By the way,
the name is Robert Roy.

915
00:58:06,366 --> 00:58:08,368
She added the "La." [chuckles]

916

[radio announcer] <i>It's

This goddamn bitch is stealing
the scene right from under me!

933
00:58:52,212 --> 00:58:53,782
She's changing the blocking
with every take.

934
00:58:53,914 --> 00:58:56,283
She's icing her nipples so
they perk up through her dress.

935
00:58:56,417 --> 00:58:58,619
Fuck you. I ain't icing
my nipples. This is natural.

936
00:58:58,752 --> 00:59:01,021
You're just sore because
yours look like fucking latkes.

937
00:59:01,155 --> 00:59:04,224
And she placed this
in my dressing room.

938
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:07,561
I don't even know
what that is. Oh!

939
00:59:07,695 --> 00:59:10,664
Guys, let's just try a take, okay? I
don't think she meant anything by it.

940
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:12,866
Let's go back to our ones.
I need a drink. Whore!

941
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,968
Nellie, back to your one.
Guys, back to your one.

942
00:59:15,102 --> 00:59:16,837
I'll give you something
to cry about!

945
00:59:24,745 --> 00:59:25,979
Whoo!

946
00:59:27,047 --> 00:59:29,450
Stop! She's changed
the blocking again!

947
00:59:29,583 --> 00:59:31,352
Fine. Grab a close-up.
No! No close-up.

948
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:33,987
To match-cut with yours.
I'm the star! I get the close-up.

949

This is my money. My company's
writing the checks. I decide!

950
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,562
Fine. Close-up on Constance.

951
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:43,430
Close-up on Constance!

952
00:59:48,769 --> 00:59:50,070
Hi, Dr. Lubin.

953
00:59:50,204 --> 00:59:52,940
I think I want to get
that operation we discussed.

954
00:59:53,674 --> 00:59:54,908

will that take to heal?

Hungarian 'cause he's good with languages.

She missed the rain in Budapest so
I built a rain machine in the garden.

01:04:20,875 --> 01:04:21,843
Tony, go, go!

1044
01:04:21,976 --> 01:04:24,511
[sighs, laughs] How you been?

1045
01:04:25,312 --> 01:04:28,215
Eh, good, good. Ah! Look at you!

1046
01:04:28,348 --> 01:04:29,750
Wow. You remember me.

1047
01:04:29,884 --> 01:04:32,086
Yeah, of course I remember
you. How could I forget?

1048
01:04:32,219 --> 01:04:35,489
And you're a star now. I
was always a star, remember?

1049
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:37,190
Right, right. [laughing]

1050
01:04:37,324 --> 01:04:40,394
And, um, what are you doing
here? Are you here for a movie or...

1051
01:04:40,527 --> 01:04:42,396
No, I had to get out of town
for a few days.

1052
01:04:42,529 --> 01:04:45,833
Some shit came up with a guy saying
I owed him money in a game of craps.

1053
01:04:45,967 --> 01:04:47,835
Then Wallach got pissed.
He straightened him out.

1054
01:04:47,969 --> 01:04:49,971
But he thinks I have a
gambling problem, which I don't.

1055
01:04:50,104 --> 01:04:53,041
I only gamble if I'm, you know,
pissed or drunk or having a great night.

1056
01:04:53,173 --> 01:04:54,508
What about you?

1057
01:04:55,575 --> 01:04:57,210
Um, Jack Conrad sent me.

1058
01:04:57,344 --> 01:04:59,013
Jack Conrad? Yeah,
I'm working with him.

1059
01:04:59,147 --> 01:05:02,649
Oh! I would fuck him. Wow.

1060
01:05:02,784 --> 01:05:05,452
Why would Conrad
send you here? God.

1061
01:05:05,585 --> 01:05:07,989
I got out of this place
first chance I got.

1062
01:05:08,122 --> 01:05:09,791
Took nothing with me but my dad.

1063
01:05:09,924 --> 01:05:11,525
He's actually
my business manager now.

1064
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:14,162
He is? Yeah. He's so bad at it.

1065
01:05:14,294 --> 01:05:17,664
Cannot add, cannot spell. Why
don't you hire someone else?

1066
01:05:17,799 --> 01:05:20,300
He's my dad.
What else is he gonna do?

1067
01:05:20,434 --> 01:05:22,402
Oh, shit, we're here. Hey, Tony?

1068
01:05:22,536 --> 01:05:25,405
Can you hang onto this
for me, please? Thanks.

1069
01:05:25,539 --> 01:05:27,607
I'm just gonna
be a minute, okay?

1070
01:05:30,577 --> 01:05:33,213
Actually, uh, do you wanna
come in with me?

1071
01:05:33,647 --> 01:05:34,849
Yeah.

1072
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:45,425
[nurse] May I help you?
Yes. Nellie LaRoy.

1073
01:05:51,866 --> 01:05:53,801
[metal door closes]

1074
01:06:08,082 --> 01:06:09,316
Hi.

1075
01:06:16,891 --> 01:06:18,725
Seems okay here.

1076
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,964
It's pretty nice.

1077
01:06:25,298 --> 01:06:26,801
This is Manny.

1078
01:06:28,502 --> 01:06:31,338
He works in the movies too.

1079
01:06:36,510 --> 01:06:38,512
Okay. Thank you.

1080
01:06:42,884 --> 01:06:45,086
That was a waste of time.
[chuckling]

1081
01:06:45,219 --> 01:06:46,453
Let's go.

1082
01:06:51,959 --> 01:06:56,898
I hate when people put
fucking toppings on ice cream.

1083
01:06:57,597 --> 01:06:58,866
Doesn't need it.

1084
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,668
It messes up a good thing.
You know what I mean?

1085
01:07:02,203 --> 01:07:03,905
I fucking hate that.

1086
01:07:05,539 --> 01:07:10,244
God, I've never done nothing
except disappoint people my whole life.

1087
01:07:10,377 --> 01:07:13,081
Teachers told me I was no good.
Boys told me I was no good.

1088
01:07:13,215 --> 01:07:16,151
Every fucking casting director
in the city told me

1089
01:07:16,285 --> 01:07:18,586
I was too short
or I was too fat.

1090
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:20,555
Usually I was too fat.

1091
01:07:21,556 --> 01:07:23,524
You know, my mama actually
had some fat years too.

1092
01:07:23,658 --> 01:07:26,727
You wouldn't know it now,
looking at her, but she did.

1093
01:07:27,863 --> 01:07:30,531
They fucked up with me, Manny.
They really fucked up with me.

1094
01:07:30,665 --> 01:07:32,801
'Cause I make 'em squirm.

1095
01:07:33,601 --> 01:07:35,603
And I like making 'em squirm.

1096
01:07:36,839 --> 01:07:41,910
Let 'em know that I got here
on my terms, not theirs.

1097
01:07:42,044 --> 01:07:45,580
And when I'm done, I'm gonna
dance my ass off into the night.

1098
01:07:45,713 --> 01:07:47,582
And they'll know...
Everyone will fucking know

1099
01:07:47,715 --> 01:07:51,619
that they could never control
one goddamn fucking thing.

1100
01:08:07,202 --> 01:08:08,703
Do you like ice cream?

1101
01:08:11,405 --> 01:08:13,407
Of course.

1102
01:08:21,549 --> 01:08:23,517
My family lives in LA, you know.

1103
01:08:26,021 --> 01:08:27,155
Really?

1104
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:31,860
I thought they were in Mexico.

1105
01:08:31,994 --> 01:08:34,129
We crossed the border
when I was 12.

1106
01:08:37,065 --> 01:08:38,432
They're not far.

1107
01:08:38,566 --> 01:08:41,103
I could take a car,
drive for 30 minutes

1108
01:08:41,236 --> 01:08:45,040
and just say hi.

1109
01:08:49,644 --> 01:08:51,146
But you never do.

1110
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,513
<i>Sí.</i>

1111
01:08:55,050 --> 01:08:57,652
It's just easier
to be on my own.

1112
01:09:01,290 --> 01:09:03,025
I've always been on my own.

1113
01:09:10,598 --> 01:09:14,403
Um, Tony, take Manny
wherever he needs to go.

1114
01:09:14,535 --> 01:09:17,940
Oh, no, it's okay. No,
no, no. I insist. I insist.

1115
01:09:18,073 --> 01:09:19,007
[sniffs]

1116
01:09:19,141 --> 01:09:21,143
I'm gonna see you
back in LA, okay?

1117
01:09:21,276 --> 01:09:22,510
[kisses]

1118
01:10:10,859 --> 01:10:15,629
[audience cheering]

1119
01:10:34,383 --> 01:10:39,553
[loud cheering continues]

1120
01:10:58,206 --> 01:11:01,642
[audience member]
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1121
01:11:15,791 --> 01:11:18,726
[loud cheering continues]

1122
01:11:20,495 --> 01:11:23,899
[car horns honking]

1123
01:11:28,303 --> 01:11:33,041
Jack? It's Manny.
Everything's about to change.

1124
01:12:17,018 --> 01:12:19,187
Nell, how you feeling?

1125
01:12:20,322 --> 01:12:21,223
I'm ready.

1126
01:12:21,356 --> 01:12:23,225
Yeah, you gonna
try a take? Yeah.

1127
01:12:23,358 --> 01:12:25,026
Okay, so we're gonna pre-roll
first. I'll cue your entrance.

1128
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:27,028
First mark is where you
say the line, "Hello, college,"

1129
01:12:27,162 --> 01:12:29,730
and then you head to the phone,
do the rest of the dialogue.

1130
01:12:29,865 --> 01:12:31,600
Sounds easy.
[chuckles] I think it will be.

1131
01:12:31,732 --> 01:12:33,969
Lloyd, any direction on voice?

1132
01:12:34,102 --> 01:12:36,972
Uh, no, we're good up
here, Ruth. Okay, great.

1133
01:12:37,105 --> 01:12:40,075
Uh, Mark, can we
fix her makeup? Mark.

1134
01:12:40,208 --> 01:12:43,178
No air conditioning?
[chuckling] It's too loud.

1135
01:12:47,449 --> 01:12:49,017
Okay.

1136
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,819
Just be natural. You'll be fine.

1137
01:12:50,952 --> 01:12:52,888
All right, places, everyone!

1138
01:12:55,023 --> 01:12:56,791
[bell rings] [footsteps]

1139
01:12:56,925 --> 01:12:59,861
Uh, hey, whoa, what is that?

1140
01:13:02,696 --> 01:13:05,300
Harry, what kind of shoes
are those?

1141
01:13:06,201 --> 01:13:09,571
Uh... Come on,
guys, rubber soles!

1142
01:13:09,703 --> 01:13:12,140
Okay, everyone, a reminder.

1143
01:13:12,274 --> 01:13:15,343
Rubber soles only from now on!

1144
01:13:15,477 --> 01:13:16,878
Okay.

1145
01:13:17,612 --> 01:13:20,882
And camera! And sound!

1146
01:13:21,016 --> 01:13:24,419
"It's Joanne from 31
Grimes Hall. I just..."

1147
01:13:24,553 --> 01:13:27,589
Fuck! "31 Grays Hall."
Grays Hall, Grays Hall.

1148
01:13:27,721 --> 01:13:29,157
"Hiya, this is Joanne
from 31 Grays Hall.

1149
01:13:29,291 --> 01:13:30,992
I just wanted to see
if the phone worked."

1150
01:13:31,126 --> 01:13:33,761
"Just wanted to see if the
phone worked. Who is this?"

1151
01:13:35,030 --> 01:13:37,966
Scene 17, take one.
[crew member] Mark.

1152
01:13:39,634 --> 01:13:41,836
[exhales]

1153
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:44,673
Come on. Come on, come on.
You know it.

1154
01:13:44,806 --> 01:13:47,708
[Ruth] And action!

1155
01:13:58,453 --> 01:14:01,256
[whirring]

1156
01:14:11,866 --> 01:14:13,802
[door hinge squeaking]

1157
01:14:19,975 --> 01:14:22,344
[electricity buzzing]

1158
01:14:22,477 --> 01:14:25,746
[footsteps]

1159
01:14:30,018 --> 01:14:31,553
Hello, college!
[microphone squeals]

1160
01:14:31,686 --> 01:14:33,188
Jesus, fuck! Cut!

1161
01:14:33,321 --> 01:14:34,256
[bell rings]

1162
01:14:34,389 --> 01:14:35,991
[Max] What happened?
She blew the valves.

1163
01:14:36,124 --> 01:14:38,660
I just need a minute.
[Max] All right, well, hurry.

1164
01:14:39,594 --> 01:14:41,630
Give me one sec.
Christ, it's hot in there.

1165
01:14:41,762 --> 01:14:44,065
[Max]
Okay, are we still in places?

1166
01:14:44,199 --> 01:14:45,900
Okay.

1167
01:14:47,902 --> 01:14:49,738
Okay, all set here.
Miss LaRoy? Yeah.

1168
01:14:49,871 --> 01:14:53,774
What would really help us would be
if you said the line a little more quietly.

1169
01:14:56,177 --> 01:14:59,014
Okay. [Max] All right,
places, everyone!

1170
01:14:59,614 --> 01:15:01,449
And camera!

1171
01:15:01,583 --> 01:15:03,184
And sound!

1172
01:15:03,318 --> 01:15:04,319
[bell rings]

1173
01:15:04,452 --> 01:15:05,787
Close that!

1174
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:07,489
Don't you know
what a red light means?

1175
01:15:07,622 --> 01:15:09,624
Scene 17, take two.

1176
01:15:09,758 --> 01:15:10,992
[crew member] Mark.

1177
01:15:11,726 --> 01:15:12,961
Action.

1178
01:15:16,398 --> 01:15:17,432
[sighs]

1179
01:15:19,501 --> 01:15:21,136
[Ruth] Cut.
Missed your mark, Nell.

1180
01:15:21,269 --> 01:15:22,037
[bell rings]

1181
01:15:22,170 --> 01:15:24,239
[Nellie] Oh. [Ruth] It's...

1182
01:15:24,372 --> 01:15:25,874
Yeah, I, uh...

1183
01:15:26,007 --> 01:15:28,810
I don't know, I felt, like, a
little lighter on my feet that time.

1184
01:15:28,943 --> 01:15:32,080
I feel I should come further into the
room. Right, but the microphone is...

1185
01:15:32,213 --> 01:15:33,815
Um... [snaps fingers]

1186
01:15:33,948 --> 01:15:35,317
All right. Hey, Lloyd? Yeah.

1187
01:15:35,450 --> 01:15:38,553
Can we just move the mic
a little deeper in the room?

1188
01:15:39,789 --> 01:15:41,856
[Lloyd] Why?

1189
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:43,725
Because Nellie felt
lighter on her feet that time.

1190
01:15:43,858 --> 01:15:46,494
[Nellie] I was just saying I think I
should come further into the room.

1191
01:15:46,628 --> 01:15:49,431
Oh, okay. Yeah, sure, I mean,
if you have half an hour to spare.

1192
01:15:49,564 --> 01:15:52,167
[Ruth] Half an hour? Well,
I can't just move the mic.

1193
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:53,868
I have to redo all the wires.

1194
01:15:54,002 --> 01:15:56,538
We'll have to reset the rafters,
then find the new position.

1195
01:15:56,671 --> 01:15:59,274
Then I'm gonna have to recalibrate
the whole room. Okay, okay. Okay.

1196
01:15:59,407 --> 01:16:01,276
Nell, why don't we just...
Is it okay...

1197
01:16:01,409 --> 01:16:03,945
Let's just try one on the
mark, okay? You can do it.

1198
01:16:04,079 --> 01:16:07,149
And camera! And sound!

1199
01:16:07,283 --> 01:16:08,250
[rings]

1200
01:16:08,384 --> 01:16:10,686
Scene 17, take three. Mark.

1201
01:16:10,821 --> 01:16:11,954
Action.

1202
01:16:12,555 --> 01:16:15,191
[squeaking]

1203
01:16:19,261 --> 01:16:21,864
[quietly] Well, hello, college.
Cut! No good for sound.

1204
01:16:21,997 --> 01:16:24,233
Well, fucking hell, Lloyd. Could
you just let us get through one take?

1205
01:16:24,367 --> 01:16:27,470
Why would I do that if you won't be
able to use it? You told me to do it quiet.

1206
01:16:27,603 --> 01:16:30,841
That's why I did it quiet. Quiet,
not inarticulate. You can't mumble.

1207
01:16:30,973 --> 01:16:32,843
This is bullshit.

1208
01:16:33,008 --> 01:16:35,644
Are we going again or what? I can't
breathe in here! We're going again!

1209
01:16:35,778 --> 01:16:37,713
And camera and sound! [rings]

1210
01:16:37,848 --> 01:16:40,116
Scene 17, take four. Mark.

1211
01:16:40,249 --> 01:16:42,151
Action. [squeaks]

1212
01:16:48,157 --> 01:16:49,925
Well, hello, college!

1213
01:16:50,059 --> 01:16:51,527
Motherfucker!
Who opened the door?

1214
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:52,895
[shouting]

1215
01:16:53,028 --> 01:16:54,330
[Max] All right,
everybody, eyes on me!

1216
01:16:54,463 --> 01:16:56,132
Any other faggots
who ignore that red light...

1217
01:16:56,265 --> 01:16:58,167
You're alternating the
pitch of your voice too much.

1218
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:00,804
Okay, can you just...
Lloyd, Lloyd, fuck off.

1219
01:17:00,936 --> 01:17:05,307
Fuck off. I listen to my fucking
director, not the fucking sound guy!

1220
01:17:05,775 --> 01:17:07,176
Who the fu...

1221
01:17:08,277 --> 01:17:11,147
Mr. Wallach, so happy
you're joining us. Come on.

1222
01:17:21,825 --> 01:17:23,359
Maybe try staying more monotone.

1223
01:17:24,427 --> 01:17:25,261
Okay.

1224
01:17:25,394 --> 01:17:27,296
And camera and sound!
Yeah, okay.

1225
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:29,031
[rings] Scene 17, take five.

1226
01:17:29,165 --> 01:17:30,633
Mark. Action.

1227
01:17:30,766 --> 01:17:32,168
[squeaks]

1228
01:17:36,907 --> 01:17:38,340
Well, hello, college.

1229
01:17:47,349 --> 01:17:49,452
Hiya, this is Joanne
from Gray... [Lloyd] Cut!

1230
01:17:49,585 --> 01:17:53,055
Motherfucking shit!
Cocksucking... What the fuck?

1231
01:17:53,189 --> 01:17:54,791
[Ruth]
What the fuck happened now?

1232
01:17:54,925 --> 01:17:56,725
I'm hearing a high-pitched
noise. Yeah, it's her voice.

1233
01:17:56,860 --> 01:17:58,727
Do you hear that?
[Nellie] For fuck's sake.

1234
01:17:58,862 --> 01:18:00,596
Do you hear? That squeak?

1235
01:18:02,364 --> 01:18:04,066
Is anybody wearing a watch?

1236
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:05,936
No. No.

1237
01:18:06,068 --> 01:18:08,437
I'm telling you, I can't
stay in there that long.

1238
01:18:08,571 --> 01:18:10,306
It's a fucking hotbox!
I get it, Bill.

1239
01:18:10,439 --> 01:18:12,775
Nobody is comfortable
in here. Quiet!

1240
01:18:12,909 --> 01:18:14,610
What is that fucking sound?

1241
01:18:14,743 --> 01:18:17,079
We gotta move this along.
[whispering] I'm so sorry, Mr. Wallach.

1242
01:18:17,213 --> 01:18:19,181
We'll get this under control,
I promise you.

1243
01:18:20,182 --> 01:18:22,585
"Hiya, this is Joanne
from 31 Grimes Hall."

1244
01:18:22,718 --> 01:18:26,255
Fuck! Grays Hall. "I just
wanted to see... Who is this?"

1245
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:30,493
[breathing heavily]

1246
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:32,428
[buzzing]

1247
01:18:34,463 --> 01:18:38,033
Hey, Count? Count?
[snaps fingers]

1248
01:18:38,167 --> 01:18:39,502
I need a red one. Yeah, yeah.

1249
01:18:39,635 --> 01:18:41,838
"The" Count.
It's just The Count.

1250
01:18:41,972 --> 01:18:43,405
Just next time say, "The Count."

1251
01:18:43,539 --> 01:18:45,074
Now's not really
"The" fucking time.

1252
01:18:45,207 --> 01:18:47,643
Found it!
It's a pin in Ruth's ankle.

1253
01:18:47,776 --> 01:18:49,311
Did you have surgery?

1254
01:18:49,445 --> 01:18:52,781
If you can just keep your
right leg absolutely still.

1255
01:18:52,916 --> 01:18:55,952
[Max] And camera and sound!

1256
01:18:56,085 --> 01:18:57,052
[sighs] [rings]

1257
01:18:57,186 --> 01:18:58,687
Scene 17, take six. Mark.

1258
01:18:59,388 --> 01:19:01,524
Action. [squeaks]

1259
01:19:04,928 --> 01:19:06,228
Well, hello, college. [sneezes]

1260
01:19:06,362 --> 01:19:10,332
Who sneezed?
Who the fuck sneezed?

1261
01:19:10,466 --> 01:19:14,270
Kike-nosed, Hymie-hole piece
of mongoloid shit! I see you.

1262
01:19:14,403 --> 01:19:16,873
Oh, I see you right there,
you little Shylock dickface.

1263
01:19:17,007 --> 01:19:21,410
Wipe your nose again! Wipe your little
hook nose, you menorah motherfucker!

1264
01:19:21,544 --> 01:19:25,247
Now, does anyone else here
need to sneeze? Huh?

1265
01:19:25,381 --> 01:19:28,751
Does anyone else here need
to fuck this scene in the ass?

1266
01:19:29,318 --> 01:19:31,387
Camera! And sound!

1267
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,255
Scene 17, take seven. Mark.

1268
01:19:33,389 --> 01:19:36,058
Action. [squeaks]

1269
01:19:39,094 --> 01:19:40,462
Hello, college. Nell, your mark!

1270
01:19:40,596 --> 01:19:42,498
[screams] Fuck this shit!

1271
01:19:42,631 --> 01:19:44,667
Fuck. Lloyd. It's a
million fucking degrees!

1272
01:19:44,801 --> 01:19:47,603
We gotta move the mic. Or you could
fucking direct her to hit her fucking mark.

1273
01:19:47,736 --> 01:19:49,705
But why is it so fucking hard?
You're right!

1274
01:19:49,839 --> 01:19:52,241
I didn't realize
we were making <i>Ben-Hur!</i>

1275
01:19:52,374 --> 01:19:54,844
I can move it right now.
My whole year is wide open.

1276
01:19:54,978 --> 01:19:57,079
We could shoot this thing
through fucking New Year's.

1277
01:19:57,212 --> 01:20:00,016
Wherever the fuck those little feet of hers
want to go, I can move the mic for them!

1278
01:20:00,149 --> 01:20:03,352
Okay, calm down! Get off of
me! I dare you! I fucking dare you!

1279
01:20:03,485 --> 01:20:05,321
Get off the set! You're good.

1280
01:20:05,454 --> 01:20:07,189
Un-fucking-professional!

1281
01:20:07,323 --> 01:20:08,959
Okay. Okay, Lloyd,
ready to go again?

1282
01:20:09,091 --> 01:20:11,995
You want me to use this chalk?
Make the mark bigger for you?

1283
01:20:12,127 --> 01:20:14,129
[Ruth] Okay, we're gonna
go again. It's fine. No, it's fine.

1284
01:20:14,263 --> 01:20:16,398
The mark's right here. I'm
gonna kick your fucking ass!

1285
01:20:16,532 --> 01:20:19,101
Oh, yeah! Come on! Come on!

1286
01:20:19,234 --> 01:20:20,769
[all shouting]

1287
01:20:20,904 --> 01:20:24,173
Can we go? I'm gonna have
a fucking heart attack in here.

1288
01:20:24,306 --> 01:20:27,077
Get back
in your fucking box, Bill!

1289
01:20:27,242 --> 01:20:28,377
[Lloyd]
I can't even believe this.

1290
01:20:28,510 --> 01:20:30,479
Everyone, shut up!
Shut the fuck up!

1291
01:20:30,613 --> 01:20:33,682
[Nellie] That's not how we
make movies. Shut the fuck up!

1292
01:20:33,817 --> 01:20:37,854
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut the fuck up!

1293
01:20:37,988 --> 01:20:40,090
Shut the fuck up!

1294
01:20:40,222 --> 01:20:44,360
Now, if anyone stops this
scene again, I will shit on you!

1295
01:20:44,493 --> 01:20:48,430
I will shit in your mouth,
I promise you!

1296
01:20:50,766 --> 01:20:55,237
Is that clear, Lloyd?
Is that good for fucking sound?

1297
01:20:55,371 --> 01:20:59,174
Now, we are going again!

1298
01:20:59,308 --> 01:21:03,612
Camera! And motherfucking sound!

1299
01:21:11,121 --> 01:21:14,223
[breathing raggedly]

1300
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,028
[rings]

1301
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:20,763
Scene 17, take eight.
[weakly] Mark.

1302
01:21:21,730 --> 01:21:23,532
[sighs] Action.

1303
01:21:26,168 --> 01:21:28,737
[squeaking]

1304
01:21:34,209 --> 01:21:36,278
Hello, college.

1305
01:21:42,718 --> 01:21:43,652
Hello?

1306
01:21:43,787 --> 01:21:45,654
Hiya, this is Joanne
from 31 Grays Hall.

1307
01:21:45,789 --> 01:21:48,158
I was just gonna see
if the phone worked.

1308
01:21:48,290 --> 01:21:49,758
Who is this?

1309
01:21:49,893 --> 01:21:53,495
You don't say. The Dean!
Well, how you doin'?

1310
01:21:54,763 --> 01:21:56,833
It's a nice campus you got here.

1311
01:21:56,966 --> 01:21:58,434
So, uh,

1312
01:21:58,567 --> 01:22:01,336
what's a girl supposed to do
once she's here?

1313
01:22:01,470 --> 01:22:03,205
[laughs] Sure, classes.

1314
01:22:03,338 --> 01:22:05,374
But ain't you got any parties?

1315
01:22:05,507 --> 01:22:07,776
Not till the evening, huh?

1316
01:22:09,045 --> 01:22:11,280
All right, I can handle that.

1317
01:22:11,413 --> 01:22:14,249
I'm from Granville, Ohio,
so I know quiet.

1318
01:22:14,383 --> 01:22:15,451
[chuckles]

1319
01:22:15,584 --> 01:22:18,253
Thanks a bunch, Dean.
See you later.

1320
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:24,326
Nice fella.
Wonder if he's single.

1321
01:22:32,434 --> 01:22:33,903
Cut! Cut!

1322
01:22:34,037 --> 01:22:36,940
[all cheering] We did it!

1323
01:22:37,073 --> 01:22:38,707
[squealing]

1324
01:22:38,842 --> 01:22:42,078
[laughing hysterically]
Yes, we did it!

1325
01:22:42,212 --> 01:22:43,947
[laughing hysterically]

1326
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:47,349
Okay, check the gate!
[Max] Billy, check the gate!

1327
01:22:48,184 --> 01:22:49,618
[laughing]

1328
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:53,756
[Max] Billy! [laughs]

1329
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:54,924
Bill!

1330
01:22:56,391 --> 01:22:57,693
Billy, come on.

1331
01:22:57,827 --> 01:23:00,596
Bill... Let's get a crowbar.
Come on. Hurry up.

1332
01:23:03,233 --> 01:23:04,234
[all] Bill!

1333
01:23:04,366 --> 01:23:06,035
[Ruth] Oh, my God.

1334
01:23:10,539 --> 01:23:11,975
He's dead.

1335
01:23:13,442 --> 01:23:18,047
[playing jazz]

1336
01:23:18,181 --> 01:23:20,415
[people whooping]

1337
01:23:21,084 --> 01:23:22,317
Manuel!

1338
01:23:23,153 --> 01:23:24,419
Meet Estelle.

1339
01:23:24,553 --> 01:23:27,157
She's from Broadway.
She's a real actor.

1340
01:23:27,289 --> 01:23:32,294
We got engaged yesterday. Now she's trying
to explain to me that movies are a low art.

1341
01:23:33,163 --> 01:23:34,296
<i>Mucho gusto.</i> Drinks?

1342
01:23:34,429 --> 01:23:36,665
Double shot of tequila.
Water, darling.

1343
01:23:39,301 --> 01:23:40,937
[shattering] <i>Hola,</i> Jacky!

1344
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:42,771
<i>Hola,</i> Carmelita.

1345
01:23:43,605 --> 01:23:45,875
I have no idea who that is.

1346
01:23:49,879 --> 01:23:53,850
The point is, darling, I believe
movies are every bit as profound.

1347
01:23:53,983 --> 01:23:56,786
And with sync sound,
which, who knows,

1348
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:59,823
could be what the discovery
of perspective was for painting,

1349
01:23:59,956 --> 01:24:03,392
I think what we have here
in Hollywood is high art.

1350
01:24:03,525 --> 01:24:06,129
It's...
Party time, sparkle cocks!

1351
01:24:06,262 --> 01:24:08,397
[all cheering]

1352
01:24:09,165 --> 01:24:10,834
Hot damn!

1353
01:24:10,967 --> 01:24:13,169
Jack Conrad? Hmm.

1354
01:24:13,303 --> 01:24:17,506
You are even more fuckable
in person.

1355
01:24:17,639 --> 01:24:20,076
Thank you. This is Estelle.

1356
01:24:20,210 --> 01:24:21,911
His fiancée. Fiancée?

1357
01:24:22,045 --> 01:24:24,080
Hey, I'm not actually
gonna fuck him.

1358
01:24:24,214 --> 01:24:26,648
I beat the whole USC football team
at a game of craps when we wrapped,

1359
01:24:26,783 --> 01:24:28,918
so now they have to be
my slaves for the night.

1360
01:24:29,052 --> 01:24:31,187
Jack, can you say hi to
my dad, please? Sure.

1361
01:24:31,321 --> 01:24:33,890
He wanted to meet you. He's also my
manager. It's a good thing we met, Jack.

1362
01:24:34,023 --> 01:24:36,192
I got a business proposition
just for you.

1363
01:24:36,326 --> 01:24:38,460
A Nellie-themed diner.

1364
01:24:38,594 --> 01:24:40,964
I'm gonna call it
"The Wild Child Grill."

1365
01:24:41,097 --> 01:24:44,466
I'm gonna serve sandwiches
shaped like her face.

1366
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:47,003
[band playing quietly]

1367
01:24:47,136 --> 01:24:48,838
[Sidney] It's not a threat,
it's just what it is.

1368
01:24:48,972 --> 01:24:51,207
If you keep playing flat,
I'm gonna fucking headbutt you,

1369
01:24:51,341 --> 01:24:53,508
and it's just gonna be
what it's gonna be.

1370
01:24:53,642 --> 01:24:55,278
You need to play better.
You embarrassing us.

1371
01:24:55,410 --> 01:24:57,815
Joe, you hear what he just said
to me? Listen to this psychopath.

1372
01:24:57,948 --> 01:24:59,817
When you gonna do something?
Why you worried about Joe?

1373
01:24:59,950 --> 01:25:01,384
Nigga, when are you
gonna do something?

1374
01:25:01,517 --> 01:25:02,920
Have you ever heard
of Alexander Scriabin?

1375
01:25:03,053 --> 01:25:05,256
Why the fuck do I care
about Alexander Scriabin?

1376
01:25:05,388 --> 01:25:07,291
Alexander Scriabin
was a Russian pianist.

1377
01:25:07,423 --> 01:25:10,160
Broke his hands just so his fingers
could stretch across the keys better.

1378
01:25:10,294 --> 01:25:13,730
I'm saying if I fucking headbutt you
across them funky-ass lips of yours,

1379
01:25:13,864 --> 01:25:15,565
you might start playing
a little better.

1380
01:25:15,698 --> 01:25:17,368
We can hope. You're
fucking deranged, Sidney.

1381
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:20,304
Elinor's trying to civilize
me for talkies. Ain't that nice?

1382
01:25:20,436 --> 01:25:21,839
"Isn't that nice?"

1383
01:25:21,972 --> 01:25:24,108
Isn't.
And more attire next time.

1384
01:25:24,241 --> 01:25:25,943
A little more attire's
always in the way.

1385
01:25:26,076 --> 01:25:28,012
Nellie dresses low
'cause Nellie is low.

1386
01:25:28,145 --> 01:25:31,081
Now, let me tell you about
the time I fought a rattlesnake.

1387
01:25:31,215 --> 01:25:33,117
It was Death Valley. April.

1388
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:35,752
Jack? It's George.

1389
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:38,923
Aw, Georgie.

1390
01:25:39,722 --> 01:25:42,192
Who was it this time? [panting]

1391
01:25:42,326 --> 01:25:43,760
Claire.

1392
01:25:43,894 --> 01:25:45,628
Claire.
Well, Claire's a lesbian.

1393
01:25:45,762 --> 01:25:47,463
That's an uphill battle
for anyone.

1394
01:25:47,597 --> 01:25:50,267
Come on, buddy, get your head
out of there. Let's go get a drink.

1395
01:25:50,401 --> 01:25:52,102
Okay, okay, I'll stop.

1396
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:56,006
I'm stuck.

1397
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:58,175
What? I'm stuck.

1398
01:25:58,309 --> 01:25:59,742
Get me the fuck out of here!

1399
01:25:59,877 --> 01:26:02,445
[emcee] Ladies and
gentlemen, your attention, please!

1400
01:26:02,578 --> 01:26:04,447
For your entertainment
this evening,

1401
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:08,718
Miss Lady Fay Zhu
will now choose a partner.

1402
01:26:09,452 --> 01:26:13,791
[band playing tango]

1403
01:26:25,235 --> 01:26:26,469
Hi.

1404
01:26:27,537 --> 01:26:29,772
I'm Nellie LaRoy's dad.

1405
01:26:30,207 --> 01:26:31,574
[chuckles]

1406
01:26:31,708 --> 01:26:33,210
What's your name?

1407
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:46,316
Cannonball!

1408
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:00,030
[laughing]

1409
01:28:06,236 --> 01:28:08,638
[crowd applauding]

1410
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:20,551
[vocalizing]

1411
01:28:20,683 --> 01:28:22,319
You're great, man.

1412
01:28:22,453 --> 01:28:25,989
You call my office 'cause we're
gonna need more musicians.

1413
01:28:26,123 --> 01:28:27,558
And you're talented, man.

1414
01:28:27,690 --> 01:28:29,059
Mr. Thalberg,
it's an honor to meet...

1415
01:28:29,193 --> 01:28:31,627
Yeah, I'm gonna go throw up now.

1416
01:28:34,298 --> 01:28:37,067
[guest 1] Spoke to my friend at
Kinoscope. He said the movie's a disaster.

1417
01:28:37,201 --> 01:28:39,203
[guest 2] LaRoy's?
[guest 1] Yeah.

1418
01:28:39,336 --> 01:28:41,405
They went double the budget 'cause
she could never hit her fucking mark

1419
01:28:41,538 --> 01:28:44,174
and her voice sounds
like a dying pig. [laughter]

1420
01:28:44,308 --> 01:28:46,642
No, seriously, apparently
the footage is so awful,

1421
01:28:46,776 --> 01:28:48,345
Wallach's already thinking
about dumping her.

1422
01:28:48,479 --> 01:28:50,981
[guest 2] I'm not surprised.
She never had any talent anyway.

1423
01:28:51,115 --> 01:28:52,950
[guest 1] Oh, my God. Zero.

1424
01:28:53,083 --> 01:28:57,254
Filthy, slutty piece of fucking
trash with a nasty voice.

1425
01:28:57,788 --> 01:28:58,956
[laughing]

1426
01:28:59,089 --> 01:29:00,891
You meet her dad? Oh, my God.

1427
01:29:01,024 --> 01:29:04,128
He's even more embarrassing
than she is. Fucking idiot.

1428
01:29:06,096 --> 01:29:07,364
Goodbye!

1429
01:29:07,498 --> 01:29:08,631
[laughing]

1430
01:29:08,764 --> 01:29:10,868
Don't come back!
[laughing continues]

1431
01:29:11,001 --> 01:29:14,271
[guest 1] It's the end, I'm telling
you. It's the end for all of 'em.

1432
01:29:14,404 --> 01:29:15,638
All the frogs.

1433
01:29:25,582 --> 01:29:28,218
[crying, sniffling]

1434
01:29:45,668 --> 01:29:48,305
[sighs] Don't be a fucking baby.

1435
01:30:02,419 --> 01:30:05,289
[Robert] And that, that is when I
grabbed the snake by the head.

1436
01:30:05,422 --> 01:30:08,258
The big fucking man!
There he is! What?

1437
01:30:08,392 --> 01:30:10,894
What's he telling you?
What was he saying to you?

1438
01:30:11,028 --> 01:30:12,496
The snake story.
The snake story.

1439
01:30:12,629 --> 01:30:15,132
Come on, buddy.
You got it, yeah.

1440
01:30:15,265 --> 01:30:16,934
[Nellie] Dad, I have an idea.

1441
01:30:17,067 --> 01:30:21,872
Why don't you fight a snake...
A real one... right now?

1442
01:30:22,005 --> 01:30:23,874
Come on. Okay, <i>no problemo.</i>

1443
01:30:24,007 --> 01:30:26,143
Let's go fight a snake. Okay!

1444
01:30:26,276 --> 01:30:30,347
Fucking listen up,
all you big-dick Mister Men!

1445
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:36,019
Who wants to see my dad
fight a fucking snake?

1446
01:30:37,921 --> 01:30:39,122
Fuck yeah!

1447
01:30:39,256 --> 01:30:42,125
[all cheering]

1448
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:45,696
[Jack] A snake's getting fought!

1449
01:30:45,829 --> 01:30:47,763
A snake's getting fought!

1450
01:30:54,071 --> 01:30:56,039
Yeah, I mean,
Chaplin is hung for sure,

1451
01:30:56,173 --> 01:30:59,243
but Gary Cooper...
Gary Cooper is a fucking horse!

1452
01:30:59,376 --> 01:31:03,413
He's also a fucking pussy. All
that cock... [snorts] ...no balls.

1453
01:31:03,547 --> 01:31:04,982
A shame. [snorts]

1454
01:31:05,115 --> 01:31:07,351
What are the schlongs like
on Broadway? You want some?

1455
01:31:07,484 --> 01:31:10,854
[Estelle] No, thank you.
Doesn't look that bad, buddy.

1456
01:31:10,988 --> 01:31:12,389
Stop! [pats window]

1457
01:31:17,928 --> 01:31:20,397
[rattling]

1458
01:31:21,398 --> 01:31:23,667
[car doors closing]

1459
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:25,602
Sweetie, come on.
Please don't...

1460
01:31:25,736 --> 01:31:27,271
[laughing]

1461
01:31:27,404 --> 01:31:29,206
[Elinor] Thank you.

1462
01:31:29,339 --> 01:31:30,374
Please, hurry!

1463
01:31:30,507 --> 01:31:32,542
[squealing, laughing]

1464
01:31:34,444 --> 01:31:37,147
This can't be where we...
Where are we?

1465
01:31:37,281 --> 01:31:39,049
[laughing]

1466
01:31:39,182 --> 01:31:41,785
Where'd he go?
[people exclaiming]

1467
01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:44,988
[laughing] [Robert] Holy fuck!

1468
01:31:45,122 --> 01:31:48,058
Out of my way! Huh. Huh.

1469
01:31:48,191 --> 01:31:51,261
No! Stand... Stand... Stand back.

1470
01:31:52,229 --> 01:31:53,397
Back!

1471
01:31:53,530 --> 01:31:55,165
I'm gonna fight a snake.

1472
01:31:55,299 --> 01:31:57,934
[rattling continues] Whoo!

1473
01:31:58,068 --> 01:32:02,572
[laughs] Look, sweetie, he's
gonna fight a snake. Isn't this great?

1474
01:32:02,706 --> 01:32:04,408
[Robert] Here we go.

1475
01:32:04,541 --> 01:32:05,575
Ha!

1476
01:32:08,779 --> 01:32:11,948
See that snake? See this man?

1477
01:32:12,784 --> 01:32:14,151
Watch this.

1478
01:32:16,887 --> 01:32:18,488
[rattling]

1479
01:32:18,622 --> 01:32:20,624
So, first,

1480
01:32:20,757 --> 01:32:25,729
one must assume
the <i>position</i> of a mongoose!

1481
01:32:25,862 --> 01:32:28,365
[growls, hisses]
[crowd laughing]

1482
01:32:28,498 --> 01:32:31,601
[imitates rattling]

1483
01:32:31,735 --> 01:32:33,805
I'm not... I'm just gonna...

1484
01:32:33,937 --> 01:32:35,439
[grunts]

1485
01:32:35,572 --> 01:32:37,809
[babbling] Tell me that...

1486
01:32:37,941 --> 01:32:41,411
If I could just've done the whole
thing over and over and over!

1487
01:32:41,545 --> 01:32:44,748
If I could just fucking
defend... Yeah... Fighting...

1488
01:32:44,881 --> 01:32:48,185
[babbling] If I could just...

1489
01:32:48,618 --> 01:32:49,853
I...

1490
01:32:52,389 --> 01:32:53,623
Aw! [laughing]

1492
01:32:57,060 --> 01:33:00,230
Motherfucker!

1493
01:33:00,931 --> 01:33:02,332
Who is gonna fight it?

1494
01:33:03,867 --> 01:33:05,869
No, I'm not onboard. I'm scared.

1495
01:33:06,002 --> 01:33:07,270
I got practice. I'm allergic.

1496
01:33:07,404 --> 01:33:11,608
Goddamn it, you fucking
pussies! [kicks sand]

1497

You fucking piece-of-shit,
fucking bullshit, fucking pussies!

1498
01:33:16,546 --> 01:33:20,183
The night is almost over.
I got a 10:00 a.m. call time.

1499
01:33:20,317 --> 01:33:24,254
I just want to see
a motherfucking snake fight!

1500
01:33:24,388 --> 01:33:27,591
Nellie, babe... Don't "Nellie,
babe" me, you six-foot vagina!

[crowd laughing]

1502
01:33:30,494 --> 01:33:31,695
I will fight it!

1503
01:33:31,829 --> 01:33:33,330
[crowd] No, no, no! [Jack] Yes!

1504
01:33:33,463 --> 01:33:35,365
I'm more man than
any of you. Nellie, Nellie.

1505
01:33:35,499 --> 01:33:37,768
I ain't a fucking pussy!
Nellie...

01:33:44,541 --> 01:33:47,010
Oh! [gasping]

See? You see that?

1509

It's that fucking easy!

Nellie! Nellie!

1516
01:34:04,495 --> 01:34:06,564
Let it go. Let it...
Hey! Hey, I got it!

Jack, do something!

1527
01:35:07,793 --> 01:35:11,996
Right. Once more
into the breach, dear friends!

1528
01:35:12,129 --> 01:35:14,198
Once more!

Welcome to the wonderful

I have to do this?

1548
01:37:24,362 --> 01:37:25,964
What do you mean?
It's gonna be great!

1549
01:37:26,098 --> 01:37:28,332
Just stand there and sing?
Exactly.

1550
01:37:28,466 --> 01:37:30,068
While it's raining. Yeah.

1551
01:37:30,201 --> 01:37:32,503
And that's Noah's Ark?

1552
01:37:33,270 --> 01:37:35,406
Uh, I believe so, yeah.

1553
01:37:35,539 --> 01:37:37,843
Because it's raining so much?

1554
01:37:37,976 --> 01:37:40,444
To be honest with you, I don't
really know why it's Noah's Ark.

1555
01:37:40,578 --> 01:37:42,213
Georgie. Come on, come on.

1556
01:37:42,346 --> 01:37:43,849
No. No. What? This is...

1557
01:37:43,982 --> 01:37:46,785
Norma's here. Buster
Keaton's here. George, no. No.

1558
01:37:46,918 --> 01:37:48,586
The song's a hit.

1559
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:50,254
[laughing] You love to sing.

1560
01:37:50,388 --> 01:37:53,859
Oh, I hate you. I
hate you. Come on.

1561
01:37:53,992 --> 01:37:56,661
Just don't let Olga
shoot me. Okay.

1562
01:38:14,012 --> 01:38:16,148
[mouthing words]

1563
01:38:28,225 --> 01:38:30,028
[director] Cut! Cut!

1564
01:38:30,162 --> 01:38:33,031
Musicians, you're on a break. I
wanna work with my actors for a second.

1565
01:38:33,165 --> 01:38:35,766
The head bobbing,
it's very mechanical right now.

1566
01:38:35,901 --> 01:38:39,203
Think of something that
makes it personal to you. Okay?

1567
01:38:39,336 --> 01:38:41,940
That's a little too much, Mary.
That's too personal. Okay?

1568
01:38:42,074 --> 01:38:44,408
So just bobbing, all right?
Let's work on that.

1569
01:38:44,542 --> 01:38:46,945
Up. Up. Rest of the body
doesn't move.

1570
01:38:47,079 --> 01:38:49,613
Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up.

1571
01:38:49,747 --> 01:38:53,584
Very good, Mary.
Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up.

1572
01:38:53,718 --> 01:38:56,287
Oh, I like this. Isolate the
shoulders. What do you think?

1573
01:38:56,420 --> 01:38:59,057
Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up.

1574
01:38:59,191 --> 01:39:00,959
You're asking me what I think?

1575
01:39:01,093 --> 01:39:02,194
Okay. Yeah.

1576
01:39:02,326 --> 01:39:03,895
This looks so much
better. [laughs]

1577
01:39:04,029 --> 01:39:06,064
I think you got those cameras
pointed in the wrong direction.

1578
01:39:06,198 --> 01:39:07,833
Do the rainbow, remember?
Big arms!

1579
01:39:07,966 --> 01:39:10,234
That's what I think. Take this
one more time. Everybody ready?

1580
01:39:10,367 --> 01:39:12,703
Musicians are ready? And action!

1581
01:39:17,408 --> 01:39:20,212
[trumpet flourishes]

1582
01:39:20,344 --> 01:39:22,214
Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up.

1583
01:39:22,379 --> 01:39:23,882
Up. Up.

1584
01:39:24,015 --> 01:39:26,550
Bob. Bob. Bob.
Bob. Bob. That's better.

1585
01:39:26,684 --> 01:39:30,122
[trumpet flourishes continue]

1586
01:39:30,254 --> 01:39:32,891
Good. Good, good, Candace.
Very good.

1587
01:39:34,592 --> 01:39:39,030
Yeah, it's coming together. This is
much better. Remember that energy.

1588
01:39:48,874 --> 01:39:53,912
[end note plays]

1589
01:39:55,013 --> 01:39:57,314
Cut! [bell rings]

1590
01:40:03,221 --> 01:40:04,688
Good idea.

1591
01:40:24,943 --> 01:40:26,577
Manuel Torres.

1592
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:29,881
How have you been?

1593
01:40:30,481 --> 01:40:32,884
Uh, well, sir. And you?

1594
01:40:35,020 --> 01:40:36,855
Y-You want to talk
with Mr. Thalberg?

1595
01:40:36,988 --> 01:40:39,423
Were these Sid Palmer shorts
your idea?

1596
01:40:41,325 --> 01:40:44,728
They're more like a collaboration
between Sidney and me.

1597
01:40:44,863 --> 01:40:47,299
Uh-huh.
How'd you like to leave MGM,

1598
01:40:47,431 --> 01:40:49,100
come be sound chief
at Kinoscope?

1599
01:40:50,969 --> 01:40:52,436
What?

1600
01:40:52,570 --> 01:40:55,307
We need Spanish-language
pictures. We're taking new directions.

1601
01:40:55,439 --> 01:40:57,641
It's changing times, Manny.
I'm honored, sir, but...

1602
01:40:57,775 --> 01:41:00,477
And we need to do something
about Nellie LaRoy.

1603
01:41:01,512 --> 01:41:02,914
Oh, yeah.

1604
01:41:03,681 --> 01:41:05,549
You know her, don't you?

1605
01:41:06,584 --> 01:41:08,887
The Jersey thing
doesn't work anymore.

1606
01:41:09,020 --> 01:41:11,488
Today's audiences find
her pornographic. [chuckles]

1607
01:41:11,622 --> 01:41:14,658
She's been hanging around Jim
McKay's casinos like a half-wit.

1608
01:41:14,793 --> 01:41:17,461
She owes gambling debts
all over town.

1609
01:41:17,595 --> 01:41:19,663
And she sounds like a donkey.

1610
01:41:20,232 --> 01:41:21,465
I mean...

1611
01:41:23,268 --> 01:41:24,501
Anyways...

1612
01:41:25,469 --> 01:41:26,905
think about it.

1613
01:41:35,046 --> 01:41:36,747
[Manny]
<i>Gentlemen, here's the plan.</i>

1614
01:41:36,882 --> 01:41:40,352
We turn Nellie LaRoy
into a lady.

1615
01:41:40,484 --> 01:41:43,420
We change her parts.
We fix her voice.

1616
01:41:43,554 --> 01:41:45,357
No more drugs. No more gambling.

1617
01:41:45,489 --> 01:41:49,560
Elinor St. John writes a story
about her amazing transformation.

1618
01:41:49,693 --> 01:41:52,130
With the right endorsements,
and with Elinor as an ally,

1619
01:41:52,264 --> 01:41:57,135
we can remake Miss LaRoy
into an actress of sophistication.

1620
01:41:57,269 --> 01:41:58,535
Like the ladies of MGM.

1621
01:41:58,669 --> 01:42:00,671
Next, Sidney Palmer.
Today's white audiences

1622
01:42:00,805 --> 01:42:02,274
want Negroes in their pictures.

1623
01:42:02,406 --> 01:42:03,741
Negro music, Negro voices.

1624
01:42:03,875 --> 01:42:06,710
So we bring Sidney to Kinoscope,
whatever he costs.

1625
01:42:10,414 --> 01:42:11,782
One moment, gentlemen.
One moment.

1626
01:42:11,917 --> 01:42:14,585
Um, Sidney Palmer, okay?
Sidney Palmer.

1627
01:42:34,039 --> 01:42:36,507
I was hoping I could introduce
the two of you.

1628
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:39,144
Miss LaRoy, meet Mr. Torres.

1629
01:42:39,277 --> 01:42:40,711
Mr. Torres, meet Miss LaRoy.

1630
01:42:40,845 --> 01:42:44,183
Mr. Torres is gonna be
working for us here at Kinoscope.

1631
01:42:48,653 --> 01:42:49,989
Hi, Mr. Torres.

1632
01:42:50,122 --> 01:42:51,556
Just want you to know
that I'm ready to change,

1633
01:42:51,690 --> 01:42:53,859
and I'll do whatever you need.

1634
01:42:57,196 --> 01:42:58,530
Call me Manny.

1635
01:42:59,165 --> 01:43:00,032
[director] <i>Cut!</i>

1636
01:43:00,166 --> 01:43:02,335
Beautiful. <i>Bellísimo, bellísimo.</i>

1637
01:43:02,467 --> 01:43:04,502
Next time, try softer, okay?

1638
01:43:04,636 --> 01:43:07,406
"But why, my darling Pierre?
Why?"

1639
01:43:07,539 --> 01:43:09,008
Walt! Walt, hey!

1640
01:43:09,141 --> 01:43:11,177
Move that microphone
45 degrees, okay?

1641
01:43:11,310 --> 01:43:14,280
That one near her,
okay? [phone ringing]

1642
01:43:14,413 --> 01:43:16,816
<i>Amigo,</i> no, no, no.
Hey... [whistles]... <i>amigo!</i>

1643
01:43:16,949 --> 01:43:19,185
It's not "Manuel," it's
"Manny." Manny Torres.

1644
01:43:19,318 --> 01:43:21,253
Not Manuel, okay?
[assistant] Phone for you, sir!

1645
01:43:21,387 --> 01:43:22,754
Yeah. [speaking Spanish]

1646
01:43:22,888 --> 01:43:24,123
[Manny] Manny Torres.
[Jack] <i>Manuel.</i>

1647
01:43:24,256 --> 01:43:26,993
[Jack] <i>Moving up fast.</i>
Jack? I'm sorry.

1648
01:43:27,126 --> 01:43:28,961
I meant to call you.
The reds chill her out.

1649
01:43:29,095 --> 01:43:30,930
Blues keep her skinny. <i>Don't
say a word. I'm happy for you.</i>

1650
01:43:31,063 --> 01:43:33,132
[Jack] <i>You deserve this.</i> Did you
see my screen test yet, Manny?

1651
01:43:33,265 --> 01:43:35,901
[Jack] <i>Now go show those
fat fucks how it's done.</i>

1652
01:43:36,035 --> 01:43:37,502
[line clicks]

1653
01:43:39,071 --> 01:43:41,539
Okay! Okay! [speaking Spanish]

1654
01:43:41,673 --> 01:43:44,642
Let's roll, people!
Let's go! Take two!

1655
01:43:44,776 --> 01:43:48,546
"Pierre, who is the fella
to whom you are speaking?"

1656
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:50,749
"Who is the fellow..." Fellow.

1657
01:43:50,883 --> 01:43:52,517
Fellow. Fuck. Fellow.

1658
01:43:52,650 --> 01:43:54,820
Welcome to your new home,
Mr. Palmer.

1659
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:05,965
And your car.

1660
01:44:06,966 --> 01:44:08,901
A gift from Mr. Wallach.

1661
01:44:13,671 --> 01:44:16,674
And that finishes at 5:30, leaving
you enough time to make the gala.

1662
01:44:16,809 --> 01:44:18,244
And a Hearst invite has
come in for Miss LaRoy.

1663
01:44:18,377 --> 01:44:20,946
Only question is,
what do we do about Fay Zhu?

1664
01:44:23,449 --> 01:44:25,818
It won't help Nellie
with the Hearst crowd.

1665
01:44:38,898 --> 01:44:41,100
"Listen to me, Catherine.
I don't care if they find us.

1666
01:44:41,233 --> 01:44:44,136
They could strip me of my rank
and it wouldn't change how I feel."

1667
01:44:44,270 --> 01:44:47,306
Latest voice tests:
Conrad Nagel, rich tone.

1668
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:48,908
William Haines, good consonants.

1669
01:44:49,041 --> 01:44:50,943
[Manny] You're messing
with Nellie's career,

1670
01:44:51,077 --> 01:44:54,513
and we're trying so hard
to get it back on track.

1671
01:44:54,646 --> 01:44:57,249
There's a new sensibility now.

1672
01:44:57,383 --> 01:44:59,418
People care about morals.

1673
01:44:59,552 --> 01:45:03,122
"I've known loss. I've known
pain. You're what gives me life."

1674
01:45:03,255 --> 01:45:05,558
Try accenting "you"
a little more, darling.

1675
01:45:05,690 --> 01:45:07,759
"You are what gives me life."

1676
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:09,661
Just a suggestion.

1677
01:45:09,795 --> 01:45:13,065
Marion Davies stutters a bit.
Maybe supporting roles from now on?

1678
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:14,967
[Manny] This sort of thing
is no longer acceptable.

1679
01:45:15,101 --> 01:45:18,204
"You are what gives me life."
Maybe try it slower.

1680
01:45:18,337 --> 01:45:21,773
Ramon Novarro can play guitar,
but south-of-the-border accent.

1681
01:45:23,608 --> 01:45:27,980
What I'm trying to say is
Kinoscope can no longer employ you.

1682
01:45:31,417 --> 01:45:35,154
Your image is not helpful, and
we don't need titles anymore.

1683
01:45:38,157 --> 01:45:39,391
That's it.

1684
01:45:42,228 --> 01:45:43,728
I'm sorry.

1685
01:45:54,507 --> 01:45:58,511
[Thalberg] <i>Jack Conrad has a
good voice, is our biggest asset.</i>

1686
01:45:58,643 --> 01:46:00,179
Also the most expensive.
[knocks on door]

1687
01:46:00,312 --> 01:46:03,349
Yeah? [Jack] <i>"You
are what gives me life.</i>

1688
01:46:03,482 --> 01:46:05,050
<i>I love you."</i>

1689
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:08,120
Then what I'd suggest there
would be to... [phone ringing]

1690
01:46:09,721 --> 01:46:11,123
[Jack] Hello? <i>Jack, it's Irv.</i>

1691
01:46:11,257 --> 01:46:13,225
<i>Listen, there's no good way
to say this...</i>

1692
01:46:13,359 --> 01:46:15,094
<i>They found George in his home
this morning.</i>

1693
01:46:15,227 --> 01:46:17,830
<i>Looks like he struck out
with a girl he was seeing.</i>

1694
01:46:17,963 --> 01:46:19,697
<i>He shot himself.</i>

1695
01:46:22,201 --> 01:46:23,235
<i>Jack?</i>

1696
01:46:25,504 --> 01:46:26,738
Thank you.

1697
01:46:33,212 --> 01:46:38,284
So, what I would suggest there
would be to play subtext rather than...

1698
01:46:41,153 --> 01:46:42,388
Honey?

1699
01:46:42,521 --> 01:46:44,256
Are you okay?

1700
01:46:45,723 --> 01:46:48,427
He was the first one
to say I have talent.

1701
01:46:49,929 --> 01:46:51,797
He saved my life.

1702
01:46:52,531 --> 01:46:53,765
Who?

1703
01:46:58,537 --> 01:47:00,738
It's not a low art, you know.

1704
01:47:00,873 --> 01:47:02,975
I want you to know that.

1705
01:47:04,443 --> 01:47:07,446
What I do means something
to millions of people.

1706
01:47:07,580 --> 01:47:11,684
My folks didn't have the money or
the education to go to the theater,

1707
01:47:11,817 --> 01:47:14,853
so they went to the vaudeville
houses, and then the nickelodeons.

1708
01:47:14,987 --> 01:47:18,324
And you know what?
There's beauty there.

1709
01:47:19,491 --> 01:47:22,795
What happens up on that screen
means something.

1710
01:47:22,928 --> 01:47:25,965
Maybe not to you
in your ivory tower.

1711
01:47:26,098 --> 01:47:30,735
But for real people on the
ground, it means something.

1712
01:47:32,571 --> 01:47:35,874
Jack, I-I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1713
01:47:36,008 --> 01:47:37,509
Of course you don't.

1714
01:47:37,643 --> 01:47:39,777
Of course you don't!

1715
01:47:39,912 --> 01:47:42,414
A hundred thousand people
see you on Broadway,

1716
01:47:42,548 --> 01:47:45,417
and it's the smash
of the century, right?

1717
01:47:46,085 --> 01:47:47,920
Well, here it's a flop!

1718
01:47:48,988 --> 01:47:50,522
A fucking flop!

1719
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:53,758
So do me a favor, darling. Save
your subtext recommendations

1720
01:47:53,892 --> 01:47:57,563
for your pretentious Eugene
O'Neill-Henrik Ibsen jerk-offs

1721
01:47:57,696 --> 01:48:01,233
that only a handful of rich
geriatrics give two fucks about,

1722
01:48:01,367 --> 01:48:04,270
and I'll do what I do
without your help!

1723
01:48:05,770 --> 01:48:07,072
Huh? [gasps]

1724
01:48:10,442 --> 01:48:12,411
[breathing heavily]

1725
01:48:16,649 --> 01:48:18,817
[crying]

1726
01:48:30,195 --> 01:48:32,598
<i>Listen, Catherine.
I don't care if they find us.</i>

1727
01:48:32,731 --> 01:48:36,001
<i>They could strip me of my rank
and it wouldn't change how I feel.</i>

1728
01:48:36,135 --> 01:48:38,837
<i>I've known loss.
I've known pain.</i>

1729
01:48:40,005 --> 01:48:42,408
<i>It's you who gives me life.</i>

1730
01:48:43,842 --> 01:48:45,344
<i>I love you.</i>

1731
01:48:53,185 --> 01:48:55,587
You think it works? It's great.

1732
01:48:56,121 --> 01:48:57,523
It's a winner, Jack.

1733
01:48:57,656 --> 01:48:59,325
You think it works?

1734
01:49:02,494 --> 01:49:04,963
[sighs]

1735
01:49:06,031 --> 01:49:08,100
I wish George could've seen it.

1736
01:49:08,901 --> 01:49:10,269
[director] Yes.

1737
01:49:11,570 --> 01:49:13,005
[knock on door]

1738
01:49:13,138 --> 01:49:15,741
[assistant] Mr. Conrad,
you're gonna miss your train.

1739
01:49:15,874 --> 01:49:17,109
Christ!

1740
01:49:17,676 --> 01:49:19,411
[groans] Ah, fuck.

1741
01:49:19,545 --> 01:49:22,848
I'm off to repair my marriage.
I'll see you bastards in a month.

1742
01:49:22,981 --> 01:49:24,550
[director] Good luck with that.

1743
01:49:27,419 --> 01:49:29,188
[Elinor] Okay, don't forget.

1744
01:49:29,321 --> 01:49:32,157
Your friend Manuel pulled a
lot of strings to get you in here.

1745
01:49:32,291 --> 01:49:34,393
These people choose
who stays and who goes.

1746
01:49:34,526 --> 01:49:36,595
So show them that you're
a lady of sophistication

1747
01:49:36,729 --> 01:49:38,063
and you'll be back on top.

1748
01:49:38,197 --> 01:49:39,865
So, now what did we discuss?

1749
01:49:39,998 --> 01:49:42,267
[clears throat]
"-ing" not "-in."

1750
01:49:42,401 --> 01:49:44,069
"Isn't" not "ain't." Mm-hmm.

1751
01:49:44,203 --> 01:49:46,472
And when in doubt,
say somethin' French.

1752
01:49:46,605 --> 01:49:47,841
Perfection!

1753
01:49:47,973 --> 01:49:51,343
Also, no drinking,
and try not to eat too much.

1754
01:49:52,144 --> 01:49:53,946
Billy! Marion!

1755
01:49:54,079 --> 01:49:55,981
Oh, Elinor! Hello.

1756
01:49:56,115 --> 01:50:00,052
May I please present to you
Miss Nellie LaRoy.

1757
01:50:00,185 --> 01:50:02,688
How do you do? <i>Enchantée.</i>

1758
01:50:02,822 --> 01:50:04,323
[Hearst] Good evening,
Miss LaRoy.

1759
01:50:04,456 --> 01:50:05,591
Oh. [chuckles]

1760
01:50:06,158 --> 01:50:07,459
Oh. [chuckles]

1761
01:50:07,593 --> 01:50:09,695
Nell, I'd like you
to also meet Mildred Yates.

1762
01:50:10,195 --> 01:50:12,064
Sir Delmer Lunny.

1763
01:50:12,832 --> 01:50:15,501
And Jonathan
and Harriet Rothschild.

1764
01:50:15,634 --> 01:50:17,269
Pleasure. [kisses]

1765
01:50:17,403 --> 01:50:19,806
[Jonathan] Gerald, have you heard
about the new Ellis Engel picture?

1766
01:50:19,938 --> 01:50:21,340
It sounds just awful.

1767
01:50:21,473 --> 01:50:23,877
[Gerald] Yes, I've spoken
to L.B. about it already.

1768
01:50:24,009 --> 01:50:26,612
There'll be no more of that
kind of thing, I can assure you.

1769
01:50:26,745 --> 01:50:31,450
Here we have a <i>pâté de campagne</i>
designed by Krümt with a Takagei bubble.

1770
01:50:31,583 --> 01:50:36,522
I hear it's Strindberg season in
New York. Do you like <i>Miss Julie?</i>

1771
01:50:37,289 --> 01:50:41,493
Yes, she is lovely
and very talented.

1772
01:50:41,627 --> 01:50:43,495
[all laughing]

1773
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:48,500
[laughs]

1774
01:50:53,605 --> 01:50:54,640
[chattering]

1775
01:50:54,773 --> 01:50:56,341
[chuckles]

1776
01:50:59,578 --> 01:51:01,246
[chattering continues]

1777
01:51:03,282 --> 01:51:05,250
Sidney. Manny.

1778
01:51:14,861 --> 01:51:16,161
All right.

1779
01:51:16,295 --> 01:51:19,765
Billy, is your new rug
really a Klikó?

1780
01:51:19,899 --> 01:51:22,734
I got it last spring.
One of a kind.

1781
01:51:22,869 --> 01:51:24,002
Mr. Palmer.

1782
01:51:24,136 --> 01:51:26,171
It is truly an honor
to meet you.

1783
01:51:26,305 --> 01:51:28,774
Teddy and I
saw <i>Cottage Blues</i> last week.

1784
01:51:28,908 --> 01:51:30,509
Genius!

1785
01:51:31,376 --> 01:51:32,411
Thanks.

1786
01:51:36,549 --> 01:51:39,185
Do you play bridge, Miss LaRoy?

1787
01:51:41,789 --> 01:51:44,457
[in French]

1788
01:51:45,926 --> 01:51:48,094
[speaking French]

1789
01:51:49,028 --> 01:51:51,431
[Elinor responds
in French] [laughter]

1790
01:51:55,568 --> 01:51:57,103
[guest]
You're from Mexico, then?

1791
01:51:57,237 --> 01:51:59,405
Uh, Spain. Madrid.

1792
01:52:00,039 --> 01:52:02,075
Spain. Madrid. Wow.

1793
01:52:02,208 --> 01:52:04,110
How did you get into music,
Mr. Palmer?

1794
01:52:04,244 --> 01:52:07,113
Uh, I taught myself, mostly.

1795
01:52:07,247 --> 01:52:10,918
Incredible.
Who are your influences?

1796
01:52:11,084 --> 01:52:13,520
Uh, Scriabin. Ah.

1797
01:52:13,653 --> 01:52:15,288
I like Rachmaninoff.

1798
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:25,298
Do you think George Eliot was
better as a novelist or a poet, Nell?

1799
01:52:27,033 --> 01:52:30,036
I think he was marvelous,
marvelous at both. [chuckles]

1800
01:52:30,169 --> 01:52:36,010
Now I do apologize, but I must
resign briefly to the powder room.

1801
01:52:36,142 --> 01:52:38,111
I shan't be long. Ta-ta!

1802
01:52:38,244 --> 01:52:41,648
...everything you need, you know,
right here. It's got the restaurants and...

1803
01:52:41,781 --> 01:52:44,985
Of course, now you can't gamble
in LA. You been to Cal-Neva?

1804
01:52:45,118 --> 01:52:47,988
This one guy McKay owns a few
joints, but he's a little scary, so...

1805
01:52:48,121 --> 01:52:50,356
One moment, please. Oh, sure.

1806
01:52:52,659 --> 01:52:55,261
Jack! Didn't think you'd get
in in time. How was Europe?

1807
01:52:55,395 --> 01:52:57,865
Inspiring! Di... And
congrats on the new film.

1808
01:52:57,998 --> 01:52:59,499
Opens tonight, right? Correct.

1809
01:52:59,632 --> 01:53:02,702
Did you know Michelangelo
painted the entire Sistine Chapel

1810
01:53:02,836 --> 01:53:03,904
on his back?

1811
01:53:04,038 --> 01:53:05,873
Manny! How's our girl doing?

1812
01:53:06,006 --> 01:53:09,409
Oh, She's doing great.
Perfect. Okay, good.

1813
01:53:12,012 --> 01:53:13,179
[Nellie]
Manny, I need to go home.

1814
01:53:13,313 --> 01:53:14,815
You cannot go home.
I can't do this.

1815
01:53:14,949 --> 01:53:16,449
You're going back out there.
I'm having a heart attack.

1816
01:53:16,583 --> 01:53:18,685
Elinor and I worked so hard
to get you into this.

1817
01:53:18,819 --> 01:53:21,154
Manny, I am dying
out there. Okay, okay.

1818
01:53:21,287 --> 01:53:23,222
They're a bunch of...
They're awful.

1819
01:53:23,356 --> 01:53:26,927
Mildred's got a fucking rabbit on
her shoulders that's probably still alive.

1820
01:53:27,061 --> 01:53:28,361
Hey. The ass-pincher!

1821
01:53:28,494 --> 01:53:29,964
They can save your career.
They don't like me!

1822
01:53:30,096 --> 01:53:31,764
If they like you... They don't!

1823
01:53:31,899 --> 01:53:33,834
...we get the right director, the
right publicity... What about Ruth?

1824
01:53:33,968 --> 01:53:35,869
I need Ruth back. Ruth
doesn't fucking cut it anymore!

1825
01:53:36,003 --> 01:53:38,072
Listen to me, I'm here
for you. It's you and me.

1826
01:53:38,204 --> 01:53:41,574
You could be a star again,
Nellie. Again. It's you and me.

1827
01:53:43,443 --> 01:53:45,178
You look beautiful, okay?

1828
01:53:45,311 --> 01:53:47,915
I look fucking ridiculous.
What's your name?

1829
01:53:48,048 --> 01:53:50,383
Nellie LaRoy.
Perfect. Once again.

1830
01:53:50,516 --> 01:53:53,286
Nellie LaRoy. In French.

1831
01:53:53,419 --> 01:53:56,689
It is French already!
[chuckles] Okay, let's go.

1832
01:53:56,824 --> 01:53:58,691
[Nellie]
"Roy" means "king," remember?

1833
01:54:01,929 --> 01:54:03,162
Beautiful.

1834
01:54:04,130 --> 01:54:06,699
Jack. It's great to see you.

1835
01:54:06,834 --> 01:54:08,468
You, too. <i>Salud.</i>

1836
01:54:09,369 --> 01:54:11,204
Are you holding up?

1837
01:54:14,842 --> 01:54:16,609
Well, I do miss him.

1838
01:54:17,276 --> 01:54:18,578
Uh...

1839
01:54:18,711 --> 01:54:19,880
Miss him?

1840
01:54:20,647 --> 01:54:21,748
George.

1841
01:54:22,548 --> 01:54:24,584
What were you referring to?

1842
01:54:24,717 --> 01:54:28,022
Uh... Jack. How was Europe?

1843
01:54:28,154 --> 01:54:30,156
Great! And good to be home.

1844
01:54:30,289 --> 01:54:31,925
That's the attitude.

1845
01:54:32,392 --> 01:54:33,927
Staying strong.

1846
01:54:37,163 --> 01:54:38,765
Where have you been? She's fine.

1847
01:54:38,899 --> 01:54:41,668
And what do you think of the
new wave of race films, Mr. Palmer?

1848
01:54:41,802 --> 01:54:46,506
I find the studios' committees for the
casting of Negroes inspiring, don't you?

1849
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:49,977
And he replies,
"Do they need an electrician?"

1850
01:54:50,110 --> 01:54:51,177
[all laughing]

1851
01:54:51,310 --> 01:54:52,946
Do you know any good jokes,
Nellie?

1852
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:54,514
Yeah, I...

1853
01:54:54,647 --> 01:54:57,216
Nell prefers listening to jokes
rather than telling them.

1854
01:54:57,350 --> 01:54:59,153
Come on, tell us a joke.
I have a joke.

1855
01:54:59,285 --> 01:55:01,021
Harold Lloyd and I
were in France...

1856
01:55:01,155 --> 01:55:02,956
Hey, how you holding up?

1857
01:55:03,857 --> 01:55:05,258
You, too?

1858
01:55:05,391 --> 01:55:08,095
Well, I guess the movie
isn't a hit.

1859
01:55:08,227 --> 01:55:09,529
So be it.

1860
01:55:09,662 --> 01:55:12,231
I'm sure you'll get
another chance.

1861
01:55:13,466 --> 01:55:15,635
Why wouldn't I
get another chance?

1862
01:55:16,269 --> 01:55:17,805
No, it just... What I mean...

1863
01:55:17,938 --> 01:55:21,909
Would someone kindly tell me
what the fuck is going on?

1864
01:55:32,019 --> 01:55:33,686
He shows up with a mime.

1865
01:55:33,821 --> 01:55:38,125
I go, "Harold, my croque monsieur
is worth a lot more than a mime!"

1866
01:55:38,257 --> 01:55:39,827
[laughter]

1867
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:43,262
Nell, you must have
some good ones. Well, I-I...

1868
01:55:43,396 --> 01:55:45,531
I am not the best joke teller.

1869
01:55:45,665 --> 01:55:48,068
[Jonathan] Come on, Nellie.
Isn't being funny what you do?

1870
01:55:48,202 --> 01:55:49,736
Yeah, I believe
that films like yours

1871
01:55:49,870 --> 01:55:52,638
are gentle but virile olive
branches in these divided times.

1872
01:55:52,772 --> 01:55:56,009
That is my cue. I should be
going. Please, you must play for us.

1873
01:55:56,143 --> 01:55:58,544
[laughing]

1874
01:55:58,678 --> 01:56:00,780
[Jonathan] Come on, Nellie.
We'll approve your next picture.

1875
01:56:00,914 --> 01:56:04,151
[Delmer] Yes, Nellie, be funny.
[Elinor] You know, I just thought of one.

1876
01:56:04,317 --> 01:56:05,819
Two fish
are on their honeymoon...

1877
01:56:05,953 --> 01:56:07,187
Actually, I got one.

1878
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:10,157
A bear and a rabbit are
shittin' in the woods one day.

1879
01:56:10,289 --> 01:56:12,025
And the bear says to the rabbit,

1880
01:56:12,159 --> 01:56:14,995
"Hey, do ya ever have a problem
with the shit stickin' to your fur?"

1881
01:56:15,129 --> 01:56:19,398
And the rabbit finishes shittin'
and he says, "No, I never do. Why?"

1882
01:56:19,532 --> 01:56:22,301
And the bear says,
"Fan-fuckin'-tastic!"

1883
01:56:22,435 --> 01:56:25,072
And he grabs the rabbit
behind the ears

1884
01:56:25,205 --> 01:56:26,272
and...

1885
01:56:26,405 --> 01:56:28,008
[gasps]

1886
01:56:30,610 --> 01:56:32,745
I can't believe you just...

1887
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:34,014
Why not?

1888
01:56:34,148 --> 01:56:36,682
Why? Haven't you heard
what they say about me?

1889
01:56:36,817 --> 01:56:39,019
I'm a degenerate fucking animal.

1890
01:56:39,153 --> 01:56:40,888
"Oh, Nellie!" Look at them.

1891
01:56:41,021 --> 01:56:45,558
"Who knows what she might do?
She's from Jersey, you know."

1892
01:56:45,691 --> 01:56:49,096
This is what a degenerate
fucking animal from Jersey does.

1893
01:56:49,229 --> 01:56:51,999
[guests gasping, murmuring]

1894
01:56:52,132 --> 01:56:54,600
[moaning]

1895
01:56:57,570 --> 01:56:59,840
[gasping, murmuring continues]

1896
01:57:02,608 --> 01:57:07,247
That's what the degenerate
fuckin' animal from Jersey does.

1897
01:57:07,380 --> 01:57:08,748
So you know what?

1898
01:57:08,882 --> 01:57:11,450
I'm gonna let you all go on
fucking your cousins,

1899
01:57:11,584 --> 01:57:13,319
polishing your guest lists,

1900
01:57:13,452 --> 01:57:16,824
plying your underaged fuckin'
mistresses with fuckin' Beaujolais,

1901
01:57:16,957 --> 01:57:18,324
you sick fucks!

1902
01:57:18,457 --> 01:57:20,794
I'm the animal?
What is this shit?

1903
01:57:20,928 --> 01:57:22,162
What is this shit?

1904
01:57:22,296 --> 01:57:25,265
I'm the sick one!
I'm the fuckin' crazy one!

1905
01:57:25,398 --> 01:57:27,767
You people make me fucking sick!

1906
01:57:28,334 --> 01:57:30,003
You're not better than me!

1907
01:57:30,137 --> 01:57:33,506
You're not! You're not
fucking better than me.

1908
01:57:33,639 --> 01:57:35,976
I don't need this shit.
[gasping]

1909
01:57:37,277 --> 01:57:40,848
You know what? I'm gonna go home,
I'm gonna stick some coke up my pussy,

1910
01:57:40,981 --> 01:57:44,650
and you all can stick
your champagne flutes

1911
01:57:44,784 --> 01:57:48,021
up your rose-smellin',
candy-tastin',

1912
01:57:48,155 --> 01:57:51,357
snow-white fuckin' assholes!

1913
01:57:55,262 --> 01:57:57,563
[guests murmuring]

1914
01:58:02,702 --> 01:58:04,905
[stomach gurgling]

1915
01:58:11,879 --> 01:58:13,113
[retching]

1916
01:58:13,247 --> 01:58:15,615
[guests gasping, clamoring]

1917
01:58:18,318 --> 01:58:19,552
[Hearst] My rug! [burps]

1918
01:58:19,685 --> 01:58:21,487
You puked on my rug!

1919
01:58:21,621 --> 01:58:24,457
[guests gasping, clamoring]

1920
01:58:26,659 --> 01:58:28,661
[gagging, coughing]

1921
01:58:36,370 --> 01:58:38,771
[guests murmuring]

1922
01:58:46,412 --> 01:58:49,883
[Catherine whispering]
<i>Please, before it's too late.</i>

1923
01:58:50,017 --> 01:58:53,452
<i>You can't stay here.
They'll find you.</i>

1924
01:58:54,154 --> 01:58:55,889
<i>They'll find us.</i>

1925
01:58:56,023 --> 01:58:59,092
[Jack] <i>Listen, Catherine.</i>
<i>I don't care if they find us.</i>

1926
01:58:59,226 --> 01:59:02,561
<i>They could strip me of my rank
and it wouldn't change how I feel.</i>

1927
01:59:02,695 --> 01:59:05,498
<i>I've known loss.
I've known pain.</i>

1928
01:59:06,900 --> 01:59:09,535
<i>It's you who gives me life.</i>
[snorts]

1929
01:59:10,503 --> 01:59:11,972
[snorts] <i>Catherine...</i>

1930
01:59:14,041 --> 01:59:15,842
<i>I love you.</i> [audience laughing]

1931
01:59:15,976 --> 01:59:19,079
<i>I love you, I love you,
I love you.</i>

1932
01:59:19,212 --> 01:59:21,614
[laughing continues]

1933
01:59:26,987 --> 01:59:31,158
"I love you, I love you!" [audience
member] "I love you!" [laughing]

1934
01:59:36,529 --> 01:59:38,899
[laughing continues]

1935
01:59:51,878 --> 01:59:53,380
[Elinor] Jack Conrad.

1936
01:59:53,512 --> 01:59:54,815
[chuckles]

1937
01:59:54,948 --> 01:59:57,951
What are your thoughts
for the future?

1938
01:59:59,319 --> 02:00:03,390
Well, my last two movies didn't
work, but I learned a lot from 'em.

1939
02:00:03,522 --> 02:00:06,226
There were things I'd taken for
granted... [pen scratching on paper]

1940
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:08,527
that maybe I shouldn't have.

1941
02:00:10,097 --> 02:00:13,599
Well, you're still
MGM's biggest asset.

1942
02:00:13,733 --> 02:00:15,701
You still command
the biggest paycheck.

1943
02:00:15,836 --> 02:00:17,570
And I'd like to earn it.

1944
02:00:17,703 --> 02:00:20,040
I'm still learning
this new language.

1945
02:00:20,874 --> 02:00:22,641
Is it true
that you've quit drinking?

1946
02:00:22,775 --> 02:00:24,777
Yeah. It was getting in the way.

1947
02:00:24,911 --> 02:00:27,181
I'm not gonna let
that happen anymore.

1948
02:00:27,315 --> 02:00:31,052
There's a lot of acting talent
coming in from the theater now.

1949
02:00:31,185 --> 02:00:35,189
Might you go to the stage
to gain more experience?

1950
02:00:35,323 --> 02:00:38,759
Elinor, I will master
the talking film on film.

1951
02:00:38,893 --> 02:00:40,694
[pen continues scratching]

1952
02:00:40,828 --> 02:00:42,729
Do you miss the silents?

1953
02:00:47,969 --> 02:00:49,003
No.

1954
02:00:49,837 --> 02:00:52,140
We shouldn't stand
in the way of progress.

1955
02:00:52,273 --> 02:00:54,142
[scratching continues]

1956
02:00:56,944 --> 02:00:59,113
Okay. Thanks, Jack.

1957
02:00:59,247 --> 02:01:02,150
You're still the kid I met
20 years ago, you know.

1958
02:01:02,283 --> 02:01:05,987
You haven't changed...
[chuckles] ...a bit.

1959
02:01:06,120 --> 02:01:08,622
Thank you, Elinor.
Neither have you.

1960
02:01:28,443 --> 02:01:29,844
[knock on door]

1961
02:01:30,710 --> 02:01:32,947
We're ready for you on set,
Mr. Palmer.

1962
02:01:51,265 --> 02:01:53,334
She's not gonna
fuck this up again, is she?

1963
02:01:53,468 --> 02:01:55,837
I guarantee you,
she's going to blow you away.

1964
02:01:55,970 --> 02:01:58,339
Is she ready? Hurry.
[assistant] I'll check.

1965
02:01:58,473 --> 02:02:01,142
You good with the money? Looks
realistic. Yeah. What about the gun?

1966
02:02:01,275 --> 02:02:04,212
We're still having a problem
with the firing mechanism.

1967
02:02:04,345 --> 02:02:06,613
<i>¡No, carajo!</i>
It still sounds like that?

1968
02:02:06,746 --> 02:02:09,649
Hi there.
It's Jack calling for Irving.

1969
02:02:10,318 --> 02:02:11,352
Jack Conrad.

1970
02:02:12,619 --> 02:02:15,323
One o'clock. All right, fine.
I'll call back then. Thanks.

1971
02:02:17,225 --> 02:02:18,226
There you are.

1972
02:02:18,359 --> 02:02:20,828
We have a serious
fucking problem. What?

1973
02:02:20,962 --> 02:02:22,897
The band looks mixed.
What do you mean?

1974
02:02:23,030 --> 02:02:26,100
I mean, the other players
are a lot darker than Sid. So?

1975
02:02:26,234 --> 02:02:29,203
Manny, do you think I could say
a line? No! Get back to the shot!

1976
02:02:29,337 --> 02:02:31,405
In your wide, next to them,
Sidney looks white.

1977
02:02:31,539 --> 02:02:33,773
But he's Black. They
won't think that in the South.

1978
02:02:33,908 --> 02:02:36,310
To them, this'll look like a mixed band.
We won't be able to book the movie there.

1979
02:02:36,444 --> 02:02:38,146
The South is big money.
That's half the revenue lost.

1980
02:02:38,279 --> 02:02:40,248
No, that's not possible.
Nellie needs this movie to work.

1981
02:02:40,381 --> 02:02:43,017
Forget working, it's not even
worth finishing at that rate.

1982
02:02:43,151 --> 02:02:45,419
Wallach'll just pull the plug.

1983
02:02:45,553 --> 02:02:48,122
[upbeat jazz music playing]

1984
02:02:51,559 --> 02:02:53,494
[sighs] What do you suggest?

1985
02:02:53,628 --> 02:02:58,132
Oh, he did, did he? Okay,
then I'll call back at 4:00. Thanks.

1986
02:03:00,700 --> 02:03:02,336
Sidney? Yeah.

1987
02:03:06,874 --> 02:03:08,708
Why? For the lighting.

1988
02:03:08,843 --> 02:03:11,212
Just to match the other players.

1989
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:20,454
For the lighting.

1990
02:03:22,223 --> 02:03:23,257
<i>Sí.</i>

1991
02:03:25,393 --> 02:03:26,427
I know.

1992
02:03:27,228 --> 02:03:28,329
But look around.

1993
02:03:28,462 --> 02:03:31,165
Your fellow players,
if we don't get the shot,

1994
02:03:31,299 --> 02:03:33,901
the studio will shut
the picture down

1995
02:03:34,669 --> 02:03:36,404
and they won't get paid.

1996
02:03:37,104 --> 02:03:39,273
You're an actor now, Sidney.

1997
02:03:39,407 --> 02:03:42,643
Actors change their
appearance for roles.

1998
02:03:42,776 --> 02:03:44,278
It's normal.

1999
02:03:57,358 --> 02:03:59,093
[sighs]

2000
02:03:59,794 --> 02:04:01,662
It's going to be on you, Sidney.

2001
02:04:01,796 --> 02:04:07,301
You are risking all these guys' ability
to feed their families over makeup.

2002
02:04:21,415 --> 02:04:22,984
<i>Gracias.</i>

2003
02:04:31,758 --> 02:04:33,160
We all good?

2004
02:05:03,624 --> 02:05:07,828
Left for the day. Huh.
Well, here's what I'm gonna do.

2005
02:05:07,962 --> 02:05:10,264
I'm gonna come down there
and see for myself.

2006
02:05:10,398 --> 02:05:13,901
No, that's exactly what
I'm gonna do. Thank you.

2007
02:05:17,738 --> 02:05:20,408
I'm sorry, I just can't
have you in here right now.

2008
02:05:20,541 --> 02:05:22,276
He left for the day, but I
can take a message for you...

2009
02:05:22,410 --> 02:05:23,377
[Jack] Thank you.

2010
02:06:43,557 --> 02:06:44,759
[director] Cut!

2011
02:06:44,892 --> 02:06:46,961
That is a wrap on Sid.

2012
02:06:48,129 --> 02:06:50,131
[crew cheering]

2013
02:06:51,298 --> 02:06:54,535
Uh, Mr. Torres?
We can't find Miss LaRoy.

2014
02:06:54,969 --> 02:06:56,370
Yeah?

2015
02:06:56,504 --> 02:06:57,571
She's gone.

2016
02:06:57,705 --> 02:07:00,074
[crew cheering, clapping]

2017
02:07:09,150 --> 02:07:11,085
[crew member]
Going over to Stage 4!

2018
02:07:13,521 --> 02:07:16,056
You'll need that to come
back. It's okay. I won't be back.

2019
02:07:16,190 --> 02:07:17,725
[typing] [door opens]

2020
02:07:17,859 --> 02:07:19,260
Madame? Let's chat.

2021
02:07:19,393 --> 02:07:20,928
I'm on a deadline, darling.

2022
02:07:21,061 --> 02:07:23,063
You know,
when I first moved to LA,

2023
02:07:23,197 --> 02:07:25,332
you know what the signs
on all the doors read?

2024
02:07:25,466 --> 02:07:28,035
"No actors or dogs allowed."
[chuckles]

2025
02:07:28,169 --> 02:07:30,237
Yeah, I changed that.

2026
02:07:30,371 --> 02:07:33,140
I helped build this place
you call home.

2027
02:07:33,274 --> 02:07:37,711
I've never had any illusions about
us. I've never pretended we're friends.

2028
02:07:38,145 --> 02:07:39,915
We're friendly.

2029
02:07:40,047 --> 02:07:42,316
I scratch yours,
you scratch mine.

2030
02:07:43,050 --> 02:07:44,385
That's our work.

2031
02:07:45,753 --> 02:07:47,121
But this?

2032
02:07:47,254 --> 02:07:49,123
This is something else.

2033
02:07:51,492 --> 02:07:52,660
[sighs]

2034
02:07:54,495 --> 02:07:57,164
What do you want, Jack? I
want to know why you wrote it.

2035
02:07:57,298 --> 02:07:59,733
No, you want to know
why they laughed.

2036
02:08:03,304 --> 02:08:05,206
Would you like me to tell you?

2037
02:08:08,709 --> 02:08:10,544
Why they laughed.

2038
02:08:13,080 --> 02:08:15,182
Sure, Elinor. Why?

2039
02:08:15,649 --> 02:08:17,284
There is no why.

2040
02:08:18,319 --> 02:08:21,722
It wasn't your voice.
It wasn't a conspiracy.

2041
02:08:21,857 --> 02:08:24,558
And it certainly
wasn't anything I wrote.

2042
02:08:25,861 --> 02:08:28,729
There's nothing
you could have done differently.

2043
02:08:28,864 --> 02:08:30,631
There's nothing you can do.

2044
02:08:30,764 --> 02:08:35,002
Your time has run out. There
is no why. Stop questioning it.

2045
02:08:40,174 --> 02:08:42,109
I'm on a dry spell. No.

2046
02:08:42,978 --> 02:08:44,211
It's over.

2047
02:08:44,345 --> 02:08:47,147
It's been over for a while.
I'm sorry.

2048
02:08:49,016 --> 02:08:51,652
Elinor, you peddle gossip.

2049
02:08:53,320 --> 02:08:54,688
You don't make anything.

2050
02:08:54,823 --> 02:08:57,658
You don't know what it is
to put yourself out there.

2051
02:08:57,792 --> 02:08:59,660
You're just a cockroach.

2052
02:09:00,628 --> 02:09:02,563
I've been counted out before.
This isn't new to me.

2053
02:09:02,696 --> 02:09:05,566
Have you ever stopped to think
why, when there's a house fire,

2054
02:09:05,699 --> 02:09:08,135
the people die
and the cockroaches all survive?

2055
02:09:08,269 --> 02:09:09,603
Jesus Christ.

2056
02:09:09,737 --> 02:09:13,374
What happened was you thought
the house needed you.

2057
02:09:14,074 --> 02:09:15,309
It doesn't.

2058
02:09:16,377 --> 02:09:19,180
Doesn't need you any more
than it needs the roaches.

2059
02:09:19,314 --> 02:09:21,349
And the roaches, knowing this,

2060
02:09:21,483 --> 02:09:25,353
crawl back into the dark,
lay low, and make it through.

2061
02:09:27,823 --> 02:09:29,224
See, but you,

2062
02:09:29,357 --> 02:09:31,693
you held the spotlight.

2063
02:09:33,395 --> 02:09:38,700
It's those of us in the dark, the
ones who just watch, who survive.

2064
02:09:43,605 --> 02:09:45,140
A house fire.

2065
02:09:45,273 --> 02:09:48,243
And there'll be
hundreds more like it, too.

2066
02:09:48,376 --> 02:09:51,112
An earthquake could
wipe this town off the map

2067
02:09:51,246 --> 02:09:53,481
and wouldn't make a difference.

2068
02:09:55,250 --> 02:09:57,552
It's the idea that sticks.

2069
02:10:00,288 --> 02:10:03,391
There'll be a hundred more
Jack Conrads.

2070
02:10:04,092 --> 02:10:05,327
Hundred more me's.

2071
02:10:05,460 --> 02:10:07,395
Hundred more conversations
just like this one,

2072
02:10:07,529 --> 02:10:10,632
over and over again,
until God knows when.

2073
02:10:15,004 --> 02:10:16,872
Because it's bigger than you.

2074
02:10:25,380 --> 02:10:28,183
I know it hurts.

2075
02:10:29,217 --> 02:10:31,686
No one asks to be left behind.

2076
02:10:33,722 --> 02:10:37,093
But in a hundred years, when
you and I are both long gone,

2077
02:10:38,293 --> 02:10:43,198
any time someone threads a
frame of yours through a sprocket,

2078
02:10:44,165 --> 02:10:45,868
you will be alive again.

2079
02:10:46,802 --> 02:10:48,403
You see what that means?

2080
02:10:49,604 --> 02:10:53,608
One day, every person on every
film shot this year will be dead.

2081
02:10:53,742 --> 02:10:57,512
And one day, all those films
will be pulled from the vaults,

2082
02:10:57,646 --> 02:11:00,482
and all their ghosts
will dine together,

2083
02:11:00,615 --> 02:11:04,419
and adventure together, go
to the jungle, to war together.

2084
02:11:05,320 --> 02:11:08,723
A child born in 50 years

2085
02:11:08,858 --> 02:11:11,393
will stumble across your image
flickering on a screen

2086
02:11:11,526 --> 02:11:15,463
and feel he knows you,
like... like a friend,

2087
02:11:15,597 --> 02:11:19,300
though you breathed your last
before he breathed his first.

2088
02:11:21,536 --> 02:11:24,706
You've been given a gift.
Be grateful.

2089
02:11:26,374 --> 02:11:28,077
Your time today is through,

2090
02:11:29,045 --> 02:11:33,415
but you'll spend eternity
with angels and ghosts.

2091
02:11:51,299 --> 02:11:52,868
Thank you for that.

2092
02:12:03,813 --> 02:12:05,915

[knocking continues]

2096
02:12:26,301 --> 02:12:27,769
Manny! I need your help.

2097
02:12:27,903 --> 02:12:30,371
I'm in so much trouble
and I really need your help.

2098
02:12:30,505 --> 02:12:32,674
Calm down
and tell me what happened.

2099
02:12:32,808 --> 02:12:35,144
I fucked up, Manny.
I fucked up, Manny.

2100
02:12:35,276 --> 02:12:38,480
And I know you've been trying to
help me, and I've kept fucking up.

2101
02:12:38,613 --> 02:12:40,682
Now I really need your help,
and I hate to ask...

2102
02:12:40,816 --> 02:12:41,851
Calm down.

2103
02:12:41,984 --> 02:12:44,186
<i>Cálmate.</i> Okay, yeah,
I was in Cal-Neva,

2104
02:12:44,319 --> 02:12:46,989
and I was playing cards
and there was...

2105
02:12:47,123 --> 02:12:50,826
This guy, McKay, runs the place
and, he's... like, you don't fuck with...

2106
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:52,393
How much? He's...

2107
02:12:56,165 --> 02:12:57,499
[speaking Spanish]

2108
02:12:57,632 --> 02:12:59,902
It's a lot. It's a lot.
How much do you owe?

2109
02:13:03,038 --> 02:13:04,372
Eighty-five grand.

2110
02:13:04,506 --> 02:13:05,673

2111
02:13:05,808 --> 02:13:07,542
They took me... <i>¿Como?</i> How?

2112
02:13:07,675 --> 02:13:09,945
He took me back into a room,
Manny, and they said

2113
02:13:10,079 --> 02:13:12,313
if I don't have the money
by the end of the week,

2114
02:13:12,447 --> 02:13:14,917
they're gonna pour acid
on my pussy.

2115
02:13:15,050 --> 02:13:16,718
[speaking Spanish]
And they're not kidding.

2116
02:13:16,852 --> 02:13:19,021
They will fucking kill you.
These people are killers.

2117
02:13:19,155 --> 02:13:20,856
Pay them, okay? I can't.

2118
02:13:20,990 --> 02:13:23,625
You don't fuck with these kind
of people. You just pay them.

2119
02:13:25,527 --> 02:13:27,595
I can't pay them.
What do you mean?

2120
02:13:27,729 --> 02:13:30,498
I don't have the money
to pay them. I don't have...

2121
02:13:30,632 --> 02:13:33,169
You're Nellie LaRoy.
Of course you have the money.

2122
02:13:33,301 --> 02:13:35,537
No, I don't. It's...

2123
02:13:37,206 --> 02:13:40,042
It's gone. [stammering]

2125
02:13:42,677 --> 02:13:45,080
We don't own the house.

2126
02:13:45,214 --> 02:13:48,951
I don't have that...
I don't have that money.

Please be nice to me, Manny.

Please. [speaking Spanish]

You fucked my life!

I have nowhere else to go.

You're the only one, Manny!

You're the only one
who's ever been nice to me.

2137

You're the only one who's
ever cared. [speaking Spanish]

2138
02:14:34,096 --> 02:14:37,800
I've always helped you, and all
you've done is break my heart!

2139

[sobbing] Please.

2140
02:14:41,736 --> 02:14:44,039

I tried.

Manny,
I did everything you said.

2145
02:15:02,690 --> 02:15:05,660
I tried. [sniffling]

2146
02:15:12,700 --> 02:15:13,936
Don't go home.

2147
02:15:15,703 --> 02:15:17,605
Stay here for a couple of days.

2148
02:15:19,707 --> 02:15:21,010
I'm gonna fix it.

2149
02:15:27,383 --> 02:15:28,616
Thank you.

<i>Okay? So? What do you think?</i>

2165
02:16:37,685 --> 02:16:40,789
Yeah. I just have one question.

2166
02:16:41,622 --> 02:16:43,524
It's a piece of shit, isn't it?

2167
02:16:44,525 --> 02:16:45,828
[chuckles] <i>What?</i>

2168
02:16:45,961 --> 02:16:48,063
And I'd be bailing
you out, wouldn't I?

02:16:48,197 --> 02:16:49,630
<i>No. No. Of course not.</i>

2170
02:16:49,764 --> 02:16:53,836
Irv, let's just call it for
what it is. That's all I ask.

2171
02:16:53,969 --> 02:16:56,839
I'll do your movie.
I'll bail you out.

2172
02:16:56,972 --> 02:17:00,608
All I want in return
is a little honesty.

2173
02:17:01,676 --> 02:17:02,945
Can you do that, Irv?

2174
02:17:03,078 --> 02:17:06,148
Can you be honest with me
for ten seconds or so?

2175
02:17:10,019 --> 02:17:12,254
I'd be bailing you out,
wouldn't I?

<i>Yeah, you'd be bailing me out.</i>

Yeah.

Okay. You know?
Really dig into it.

Yeah. Find it out here.

Find it on that horizon. Yeah.

Manny, I got it all figured out.

2208
02:18:57,193 --> 02:18:59,162
Because I know that you've
been trying to get my career going.

2209
02:18:59,295 --> 02:19:01,965
I've had an idea.
I was thinking I can dance.

2210

If I can dance,
I bet I can sing.

Nellie, you have to stop this,
okay? You really have to stop.

2213

I'm figuring out
how to get the money.

02:19:09,939 --> 02:19:11,640
Exactly! This is how
we make the money back.

2215
02:19:11,773 --> 02:19:13,675
I'm gonna tell Wallach that we're
gonna finish the movie, okay?

2216
02:19:13,810 --> 02:19:15,979
And first, all this,
all this fucking mess

2217
02:19:16,112 --> 02:19:18,181
that you are doing every
fucking day is part of your process.

2218
02:19:18,314 --> 02:19:21,184
Manny, it's gonna be like
nothing anyone's ever seen.

2219
02:19:21,317 --> 02:19:22,051
[phone rings]

2220
02:19:22,185 --> 02:19:23,853
Hello? Manny, it's done.

2221
02:19:23,987 --> 02:19:25,687
I got the money and I know
a guy who will set the meet.

2222
02:19:25,822 --> 02:19:28,491
You got it? Okay, but... but
you're going to be there, right?

2223
02:19:28,625 --> 02:19:32,328
Don't worry, I'll be there the
whole time. See you Friday.

2224
02:19:33,329 --> 02:19:34,397
[chuckles]

2225
02:19:34,531 --> 02:19:36,299
Nellie, we did it, okay?

2226
02:19:36,432 --> 02:19:39,035
Fuck Don Wallach!
Fuck all of this shit, okay?

2227
02:19:39,169 --> 02:19:41,504
Fuck him, Manny! Yes!
Fuck it! Fuck it!

2228
02:19:41,638 --> 02:19:43,072
[both shout]

2229
02:19:47,443 --> 02:19:50,980
[Manny] How did you get the money
so fast? I have my ways. Don't worry.

2230
02:19:51,114 --> 02:19:53,682
And it's all in here? Yes.

2231
02:19:54,716 --> 02:19:56,085
How do you know the guy?

2232
02:19:56,219 --> 02:19:58,687
I sold him keys a while
back. He works for McKay.

2233
02:19:58,821 --> 02:20:02,691
So, we give him the bag, he calls McKay,
and the threat against Nellie is off.

2234
02:20:02,825 --> 02:20:04,227
Okay, okay.

2235
02:20:05,761 --> 02:20:07,263
I'm not used to
this kind of people.

2236
02:20:07,397 --> 02:20:09,432
They're no worse
than movie people.

2237
02:20:11,167 --> 02:20:12,368
You good?

2238
02:20:12,936 --> 02:20:14,971
Yeah, yeah. Let's go.

2239
02:20:15,939 --> 02:20:19,175
Remember. A monologue
in the next picture.

2240
02:20:26,015 --> 02:20:27,884
Wilson. Been a while.

2241
02:20:28,017 --> 02:20:30,253
Good to see you. Meet Manny.

2242
02:20:30,386 --> 02:20:33,389
[snorting, hawking]

2243
02:20:35,792 --> 02:20:37,427
Nice to meet you, Manny.

2244
02:20:37,560 --> 02:20:39,596
And nice to meet you, sir.

2245
02:20:39,728 --> 02:20:42,031
I believe this belongs to you.

2246
02:20:49,872 --> 02:20:51,174
You're a producer?

2247
02:20:51,708 --> 02:20:53,742
Um, a studio executive.

2248
02:20:53,876 --> 02:20:56,479
Jim heard
you were a big producer.

2249
02:20:56,613 --> 02:21:00,016
He's here now. He'd love
to buy you guys a drink.

2250
02:21:01,417 --> 02:21:04,487
That's very kind of him,
but... Sounds great. Yeah.

2251
02:21:05,054 --> 02:21:06,755
Great. Follow me.

2252
02:21:09,926 --> 02:21:12,428
Gotta be polite. One drink.

2253
02:21:13,563 --> 02:21:14,797
Fuck.

2254
02:21:19,335 --> 02:21:20,370

[ballad playing

2256
02:21:32,682 --> 02:21:33,716
Jim.

2257
02:21:34,350 --> 02:21:36,919
This is Manny and The Count.

2258
02:21:38,154 --> 02:21:40,556
How do you boys do?

2259
02:21:41,124 --> 02:21:42,558
I'm James McKay.

2260
02:21:43,593 --> 02:21:45,261
How do you do, sir? Hello.

2261
02:21:45,695 --> 02:21:46,896
Sit down.

2262
02:21:47,697 --> 02:21:48,798
Thank you.

2263
02:21:52,669 --> 02:21:53,703
[The Count] Hey. [Manny] Hi.

2264
02:21:53,836 --> 02:21:55,238
[James] Do you want a drink?

2265
02:21:55,371 --> 02:21:57,373
It's brandy mixed with ether.

2266
02:21:57,507 --> 02:21:58,508
Yes. Sure.

2267
02:21:58,641 --> 02:22:00,710
Wilson, will you
get us some drinks, please?

2268
02:22:00,843 --> 02:22:02,879
[snorts, spits]

2269
02:22:03,012 --> 02:22:07,517
Sir, I... I just wanted to say how
sorry I am that things got out of hand.

2270
02:22:07,650 --> 02:22:09,686
Nonsense. You came through.

2271
02:22:09,819 --> 02:22:11,087
That's what counts.

2272
02:22:13,122 --> 02:22:16,659
So, you boys are friends
with Nellie LaRoy?

2273
02:22:16,794 --> 02:22:18,161
Um, yeah.

2274
02:22:18,294 --> 02:22:19,495
Mmm.

2275
02:22:19,629 --> 02:22:22,098
Too bad what happened
to her career, huh?

2276
02:22:22,231 --> 02:22:24,634
Such a shame, yeah. It's sad.

2277
02:22:24,767 --> 02:22:26,169
Her new movie will work.

2278
02:22:27,103 --> 02:22:29,172
So you're the movie producer.

2279
02:22:30,006 --> 02:22:31,474
Uh, studio executive.

2280
02:22:31,607 --> 02:22:35,311
I got some movie ideas myself.
You wanna hear them?

2281
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:38,514
Yes.

2282
02:22:39,282 --> 02:22:40,183
Please.

2283
02:22:41,050 --> 02:22:43,019
[clears throat, inhales sharply]

2284
02:22:43,152 --> 02:22:45,288
[chuckles] Okay.

2285
02:22:46,589 --> 02:22:47,657
Mmm.

2286
02:22:47,791 --> 02:22:48,725
[giggles]

2287
02:22:48,858 --> 02:22:51,694
Okay, so,

2288
02:22:51,829 --> 02:22:56,065
there's a 10-year-old kid and he's
a prodigy at all these adult things.

2289
02:22:56,199 --> 02:22:58,201
He's supersmart with words.

2290
02:22:58,334 --> 02:23:03,573
He can play the piano and
recite Lincoln and all this stuff.

2291
02:23:04,774 --> 02:23:06,476
Here's the twist:

2292
02:23:07,310 --> 02:23:10,346
Turns out
he's a 50-year-old midget.

2293
02:23:10,480 --> 02:23:14,450
He only looks like he's a kid.
The joke's on us.

2294
02:23:15,885 --> 02:23:16,986
[chuckles]

2295
02:23:17,120 --> 02:23:19,389
That's really good. Wow.

2296
02:23:19,522 --> 02:23:21,557
It's very good.
It's great, yeah.

2297
02:23:21,691 --> 02:23:23,794
Very good. I am sorry.

2298
02:23:23,926 --> 02:23:27,096
I'm gonna check on the drinks.
I don't know where Wilson went.

2299
02:23:32,635 --> 02:23:34,370
[sighs] Stupid...

2300
02:23:34,504 --> 02:23:36,874
One drink and we leave.
Right after this we leave.

2301
02:23:37,006 --> 02:23:38,941
Calm down. I am calm, <i>cabrón.</i>

2302
02:23:39,075 --> 02:23:40,943
No, you're not.
You're very nervous.

2303
02:23:41,077 --> 02:23:44,213
I'm not here for drinks and
fun, okay? I'm in your debt.

2304
02:23:44,347 --> 02:23:46,817
You're not in my debt.
Whose money it is?

2305
02:23:46,949 --> 02:23:49,552
The guy makes it by
the kilo. It's not a big deal.

2306
02:23:49,685 --> 02:23:51,855
What guy? You never
told me how you got it.

2307
02:23:51,988 --> 02:23:54,490
Tony. The prop guy.

2308
02:23:54,624 --> 02:23:56,894
I thought I told you that.
It's the prop guy's money?

2309
02:23:57,026 --> 02:23:59,262
No, it's the money
that he makes.

2310
02:24:00,062 --> 02:24:02,598
What do you mean?
Like, uh, his income?

2311
02:24:03,132 --> 02:24:04,700
No, it's his...

2312
02:24:04,835 --> 02:24:08,504
It's from your bank heist
picture. It's movie money.

2313
02:24:08,638 --> 02:24:10,339
It's prop money.

2314
02:24:14,878 --> 02:24:18,314
The money in the bag
is prop money?

2315
02:24:18,448 --> 02:24:21,951
Well, where was I gonna
get 85 grand in two days?

2316
02:24:22,084 --> 02:24:24,487
We have to go now,
<i>pendejo cabrón!</i>

2317
02:24:24,620 --> 02:24:25,555
[shushes] Calm.

2318
02:24:25,688 --> 02:24:28,591
Um, have I, uh,
interrupted something?

2319
02:24:28,724 --> 02:24:30,326
[The Count] No, no.

2320
02:24:30,460 --> 02:24:32,595
Oh, thank you.

2321
02:24:33,931 --> 02:24:36,399
[hawks, spits]

2322
02:24:36,532 --> 02:24:38,267
I got more ideas.

2323
02:24:38,401 --> 02:24:40,403
You ever heard of Wyatt Earp?

2324
02:24:40,536 --> 02:24:43,072
He died a couple of years ago.
I met him once.

2325
02:24:43,206 --> 02:24:44,640
Little known fact:

2326
02:24:44,774 --> 02:24:49,545
The greatest hero of the
Wild West couldn't count.

2327
02:24:49,679 --> 02:24:50,713
No? No.

2328
02:24:50,848 --> 02:24:52,950
So I was thinking,
you make a movie about him,

2329
02:24:53,082 --> 02:24:55,919
and in it, you make
him full-fledged retard.

2330
02:24:56,052 --> 02:24:59,088
[gasps] What?

2331
02:25:00,056 --> 02:25:01,290
You okay?

2332
02:25:02,391 --> 02:25:04,994
What? You're sweating.

2333
02:25:08,397 --> 02:25:10,533
It's probably the ether. It's...

2334
02:25:10,666 --> 02:25:12,001
Oh.

2335
02:25:12,134 --> 02:25:14,470
I thought you were just
excited about the idea.

2336
02:25:17,440 --> 02:25:20,743

2337
02:25:21,677 --> 02:25:22,578
[snorts, spits]

2338
02:25:22,712 --> 02:25:24,480
[James] My next idea's my best:

2339
02:25:24,614 --> 02:25:26,782
The world's most
fearless warrior.

2340
02:25:26,917 --> 02:25:30,186
I know just the guy to play him.
You just build the movie around him.

2341
02:25:30,319 --> 02:25:32,288
He is sensational.

2342
02:25:32,722 --> 02:25:33,790
He is?

2343
02:25:36,092 --> 02:25:37,660
Would you like to meet him?

2344
02:25:39,762 --> 02:25:41,999
Sure. Um, I...
I can have the studio set...

2345
02:25:42,131 --> 02:25:45,601
Oh, no, no, no. I'm going to see
him now. He's at the Blockhouse.

2346
02:25:47,336 --> 02:25:50,573
Where is that?
It's just over the hill.

2347
02:25:50,706 --> 02:25:54,210
A few minutes' drive. Wilson
and I can take you there and back.

2348
02:25:54,343 --> 02:25:56,679
It's the best party in town.

Mmm.

2350

It's, uh... It's very late and we
have to go. Oh, no, no, it's worth it.

02:26:04,253 --> 02:26:05,655
I promise you.

2352

I mean, I appreciate it,
but we have to go. Trust me.

Oh, come on, boys,
it's just on the other side.

2393

You either are a star
or you aren't. And he is!

2409
02:30:27,651 --> 02:30:30,754

He's just made

2419
02:31:13,331 --> 02:31:15,199
They found him
in a forest in Oregon.

2420
02:31:15,333 --> 02:31:18,236
He will do anything for cash.

2421

Wilson, quick, give me a 20.

2422

[Lewis] You have to see Dresden.
It's the most beautiful city in Germany.

2449
02:33:22,126 --> 02:33:24,594
[Rebecca] Jack said he was gonna
take me to Greece. [Lewis] Greece?

2450
02:33:24,728 --> 02:33:26,496
Isn't that right, honey?
That's right.

2451
02:33:26,629 --> 02:33:28,598
The architecture is amazing.
You'll love it.

2452
02:33:28,732 --> 02:33:31,102
Santoríni. [Rebecca]
I hear it's so beautiful.

Folks, I'd like to introduce you to
the wild and wonderful Lady Fay.

This is Rebecca. This is Lewis.

2457
02:33:40,777 --> 02:33:42,179
How do you do? [Rebecca] Hello.

2458
02:33:42,313 --> 02:33:44,115
How do you do?
[Jack] What's your excuse?

2459
02:33:44,248 --> 02:33:45,548
Just wandering through?

2460
02:33:45,682 --> 02:33:48,285
Mmm. Something like that.
Let me get you a drink.

2461
02:33:48,419 --> 02:33:50,321
Were you shooting? No.

2462
02:33:50,454 --> 02:33:52,256
Just wanted some air.

2463
02:33:52,390 --> 02:33:53,623
What's next?

2464
02:33:53,757 --> 02:33:56,127
I'm going to Europe,
actually. Are you?

2465
02:33:56,260 --> 02:33:57,594
Yeah, Pathé wants me.

2466
02:33:57,727 --> 02:34:01,332
That's great!
Pathé's got really good taste.

2467
02:34:01,465 --> 02:34:02,400
Thank you.

[sighs, chuckles]

2471
02:34:09,306 --> 02:34:11,909
So how's your movie? It's shit.

2472
02:34:13,477 --> 02:34:16,247
Another giant swing
at mediocrity.

2473
02:34:17,381 --> 02:34:19,917
Well, the girl seems nice.

2474
02:34:21,485 --> 02:34:22,719
She is.

2475
02:34:24,388 --> 02:34:28,159
And she has no idea
it'll end like all the others.

2476
02:34:28,292 --> 02:34:30,027
You like her?

2477
02:34:30,161 --> 02:34:31,195
No.

2478
02:34:33,898 --> 02:34:35,833
You might want to save her.

2479
02:34:45,642 --> 02:34:47,878
You okay, sweetie?

2480
02:34:57,054 --> 02:35:00,091
It was the most magical place
in the world, wasn't it?

2481
02:35:03,060 --> 02:35:03,794
It was.

2482
02:35:03,928 --> 02:35:06,997
Another set, another review.

2483
02:35:07,798 --> 02:35:10,267
Another romance,
another breakup.

2484
02:35:12,602 --> 02:35:14,371
I'm tired, Fay.

2485
02:35:24,315 --> 02:35:25,483
It's okay.

2486
02:35:26,884 --> 02:35:30,955
[clicks tongue] It's okay. I've been
the luckiest bastard in the world.

2487
02:35:33,257 --> 02:35:36,927
I had a good run, didn't
I? Hmm? You sure did.

2488
02:35:37,428 --> 02:35:39,196
Yeah. I enjoyed that.

2489
02:35:40,965 --> 02:35:42,833
I gotta run, sweetie. Yep.

2490
02:35:42,967 --> 02:35:47,071
It was so good to see you, Fay.
You're gonna do great things in Europe.

2491
02:35:47,204 --> 02:35:50,007
You were always one of
the good ones. Thank you.

2492
02:35:56,348 --> 02:35:58,383
Ciao, my love. Ciao.

2493
02:36:00,986 --> 02:36:03,889
See you in Venice. See
you in Prague. [Fay chuckles]

2494
02:36:35,686 --> 02:36:37,923
I'm gonna go get those cigars.

2495
02:36:46,565 --> 02:36:51,503
Hey, you do a great job. What's
the best tip you've ever received?

2496
02:36:51,636 --> 02:36:53,238
Fifty dollars.

2497
02:36:53,371 --> 02:36:54,639
Who gave you that?

2498
02:36:54,772 --> 02:36:56,942
You did, Mr. Conrad.

2499
02:36:58,643 --> 02:37:02,280

Get up. I don't feel good.

We are going to
Mexico, Nellie. Mexico?

2505
02:38:41,546 --> 02:38:44,416
Get dressed. We are going now. I'm
not going to Mexico. Are you crazy?

2506
02:38:44,549 --> 02:38:46,184
They are going to
fucking kill us, okay?

2507
02:38:46,318 --> 02:38:47,652
I fucked up. Go hit a
<i>piñata</i> if you're homesick.

2508
02:38:47,786 --> 02:38:50,455
Nellie, get dressed
and get in the fucking car, now!

2509
02:38:50,588 --> 02:38:54,125
Manny, you're scaring me.
I need another hit.

Okay, I feel better.

2511

See you in ten minutes, <i>cabrón.</i>
Ten minutes.
