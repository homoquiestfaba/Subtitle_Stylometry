[Terese] <i>It's a pretty
foolproof system.</i>

351
00:17:57,712 --> 00:18:01,149
<i>If a character coughs,
they die.</i>

352
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,483
<i>Maybe that's why people
are always so concerned</i>

353
00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:05,787
<i>when I causally cough.</i>

354
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,656
<i>It's been subconsciously
ingrained into them</i>

355
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:11,591
<i>that it means I'm gonna, like,
die or something.</i>

356
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:16,329
<i>And I am, but not,
like, soon...</i>

357
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:18,800
<i>I think.</i>

Don't you think
that's kind of creepy?

364
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,832
Jesus, Amanda!

365
00:18:50,865 --> 00:18:53,433
Just saying.
You're drooling.

366
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:56,303
You should shoot your shot.

367
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:57,672
Oh, my God.
It's a pandemic.

368
00:18:57,705 --> 00:18:59,907
I can't just go around
dating random dudes.

369
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:01,976
[Amanda] You could do it
from a distance.

370
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:04,979
[gasps] Oh, my God, it would be
like <i>Five Feet Apart.</i>

371
00:19:05,012 --> 00:19:06,914
Okay, that's really insensitive.

372
00:19:06,948 --> 00:19:10,051
And also, no it wouldn't
because he doesn't have CF.

373
00:19:10,084 --> 00:19:11,284
How do you know?

374
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:16,389
Because it would just be
way too ironic.

375
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,427
Where are you going?

376
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,395
Just getting a coffee.

377
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:24,065
Do you have a mask?

378
00:19:24,098 --> 00:19:26,033
Duh!
Look.

379
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:29,170
All I'm saying is if you're
so starved for a relationship,

380
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:31,205
you have the perfect
potential man gardening

381

of this duplex.

382
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,675
- Whatever!
- [door opens]

383
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:37,410
And also, I'm not starved
for a relationship.

384
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:39,180
I just want some dick!

385
00:19:39,213 --> 00:19:40,413
[door closes]

386
00:19:43,718 --> 00:19:45,585
God, I really hope
he didn't hear that.

387
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:48,990
Then again...

- Hey.
- Hey!

391
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:09,710
So, um, I think just maybe

392
00:20:09,744 --> 00:20:13,547
we should be, um, limiting
how much we're going out.

393
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:16,818
I mean, I just got a coffee,

394
00:20:18,186 --> 00:20:20,621
For the third time this week.

395
00:20:20,655 --> 00:20:22,623
Terese, don't worry.
I'm being careful.

396
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:27,195
Okay, can you just wash
your hands please?

397
00:20:28,296 --> 00:20:30,430
Yeah, I was going to.
I just got home.

398
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:32,800
Just give me the chance to.
Okay?

399
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:41,508
[Terese] <i>She barely even told me
she was coming back,</i>

400
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:45,112
and the reason she left
hasn't changed at all.

401
00:20:45,146 --> 00:20:47,081
And I feel like
I'm gonna get COVID,

402
00:20:47,114 --> 00:20:49,116
and it's gonna be all her fault.

403
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:52,419
<i>Ooh, okay.
That's a little extreme.</i>

404
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,156
[Terese] Yeah, I can't help but
feel she's being irresponsible

405
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:57,325
and she's going outside though.

406
00:20:57,357 --> 00:21:00,594
<i>But you can't know
how she's acting.</i>

407
00:21:00,628 --> 00:21:02,330
Exactly.
That's my issue.

408
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:05,365
I feel like I've lost
all control with her back.

409
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:08,703
<i>Well, I know how you like
your control.</i>

410
00:21:08,736 --> 00:21:11,504
<i>Have you tried talking
to her about it?</i>

411
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:14,242
Yes.

412
00:21:14,275 --> 00:21:17,678
<i>No, I mean</i> actually <i>talking</i>
<i>to her about it.</i>

413
00:21:17,712 --> 00:21:20,147
<i>Like setting ground rules,</i>

414
00:21:20,181 --> 00:21:23,184
<i>making your standards
explicitly clear.</i>

415
00:21:23,217 --> 00:21:25,286
I guess you're right.

416
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:27,788
I just, like... my anxiety's
running my life.

417
00:21:27,822 --> 00:21:31,192
<i>And it can be...</i>

418
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:35,562
<i>Overwhelming when...</i>

419
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:39,734
<i>you let your anxiety consume
the people around you as well.</i>

420
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:42,236
Wait, is that how you felt?

421
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:45,706
Is that why you, like, you
left earlier than...

422
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,143
<i>No, no, no, no.
My mom made me come home.</i>

423
00:21:49,176 --> 00:21:50,311
<i>Um...</i>

424
00:21:50,344 --> 00:21:52,545
<i>But yeah.</i>

425
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:54,615
<i>Like, I did feel that way
a little bit.</i>

426
00:21:56,117 --> 00:21:57,919
<i>I... I didn't mind it
too much though</i>

427
00:21:57,952 --> 00:22:00,520
<i>because I know how important
this is for you.</i>

428
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:03,024
<i>Amanda knows you have CF.</i>

429
00:22:03,057 --> 00:22:06,593
<i>But I don't think she
understands what that means.</i>

430
00:22:07,762 --> 00:22:10,398
[Terese] <i>But she's just
a sub-leaser.</i>

431
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,666
[dramatic musical sting]

432
00:22:11,699 --> 00:22:13,167
A sub-leaser who's gonna be here

433
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,902
for the next year.

434
00:22:14,936 --> 00:22:17,672
Just tell her.
It'll make your life easier.

435
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:36,157
- Hey.
- Hey!

436
00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:39,592
So I just... uh, I just wanted
to talk to you.

437
00:22:40,094 --> 00:22:43,864
Um, I guess you should know
about me.

438
00:22:43,898 --> 00:22:46,599
Well, since we're gonna be
living together,

439
00:22:46,634 --> 00:22:49,136
I just...

440
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:53,441
Um, I thought
you should know that, um...

441
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:58,112
I have Cystic Fibrosis.

442
00:23:00,448 --> 00:23:02,083
Oh.

443
00:23:02,116 --> 00:23:03,384
Yeah, no, yeah.
It's not...

444
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:06,654
It's not a big deal or anything.
Um...

445
00:23:06,687 --> 00:23:09,390
It's just, like, you might see
some, like, equipment,

446
00:23:09,423 --> 00:23:13,127
uh, laying around
or, like, just...

447
00:23:15,196 --> 00:23:16,529
Okay.

448
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,567
Yeah!
Uh, yeah.

449
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,502
[stammers] Cool.
Well...

450
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:27,408
Now that you know,
that is a cool fun fact

451
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:28,508
that you know about me.

452
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,177
Okay.
I'll talk to you later.

453
00:23:30,211 --> 00:23:32,579
That's a really good juice,
that.

454
00:23:32,613 --> 00:23:34,348
See ya later.

455
00:23:34,382 --> 00:23:35,850
[sighs]

456
00:23:36,717 --> 00:23:40,087
It's just like it's so much
easier being alone.

457
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:41,588
[friend on videochat] <i>You sure?</i>

458
00:23:42,823 --> 00:23:45,693

[soft acoustic music]

460
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:55,870
- [Amanda] Hey.
- Mm.

461
00:23:55,903 --> 00:23:57,271
[Amanda] What's up?

462
00:23:59,373 --> 00:24:01,175
This.
[chuckles]

463
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:03,978
Looks like we have
the same idea.

464
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:06,013
Since when are you
a big drinker?

465
00:24:07,314 --> 00:24:10,418
Quarantine has a tendency
to change things.

466
00:24:11,652 --> 00:24:14,388
Can you just, um,
wipe that down though please?

467
00:24:15,156 --> 00:24:16,891
Uh, okay.

468
00:24:24,665 --> 00:24:26,133
Yeah, can you just
maybe thorough...

469
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:29,303
Terese, look... I'm not
irresponsible or anything.

470
00:24:29,336 --> 00:24:31,405
Can you stop watching me
like a hawk?

471
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:32,840
Okay, I'm sorry.

472
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:34,809
I don't mean to be, like,
backseat cleaning,

473
00:24:34,842 --> 00:24:36,710
but I just... I realized
we haven't had

474
00:24:36,744 --> 00:24:39,180
a proper conversation
about COVID safety procedures

475
00:24:39,213 --> 00:24:40,815
since you've been back, and I...

476
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:44,351
I really just do need
a little bit more from you.

477
00:24:44,385 --> 00:24:46,554
What, do you want me
to get tested more?

478
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,422
Sure, I mean, getting tested
more would be great,

479
00:24:48,456 --> 00:24:50,491
but by the time
you tested positive,

480
00:24:50,524 --> 00:24:51,725
you would have
already exposed me.

481
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:53,027
And I'm just trying
to think of ways

482
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,262
we can both avoid exposure
in general.

483
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,432
For me, best practice is
to kind of overreact,

484
00:24:58,466 --> 00:25:01,936
and with CF, it...

485
00:25:01,969 --> 00:25:04,705
like, I just... I have to be
at a higher alert

486
00:25:04,738 --> 00:25:07,408
for this kind of stuff, so...

487
00:25:07,441 --> 00:25:10,878
It just makes me really anxious.

488
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:13,180
Yeah.
I can tell.

489
00:25:13,214 --> 00:25:14,448
[bottle scrapes]

490
00:25:14,482 --> 00:25:17,518
[music continues]

491
00:25:19,487 --> 00:25:22,089
I realize I should have said
this right when you got back,

492
00:25:22,123 --> 00:25:24,725
but I just need you to be
at the same level

493
00:25:24,758 --> 00:25:26,460
of precaution as me or it...

494
00:25:26,494 --> 00:25:29,330
it's just kind of all
for nothing then.

495
00:25:31,732 --> 00:25:34,468
Okay.
So what are the rules?

496
00:25:34,502 --> 00:25:36,437
Okay, well everything that comes
into the house

497
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,705
has to be wiped down.

498
00:25:37,738 --> 00:25:39,473
I mean, sanitized completely.

499
00:25:39,507 --> 00:25:42,209
Sanitize your hands.
Wash your hands right after.

500
00:25:42,243 --> 00:25:44,211
Leave all the bags in the trash.

501
00:25:44,245 --> 00:25:45,946
Make sure that you always have
gloves on

502
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,616
whenever you're outside.

503
00:25:47,648 --> 00:25:49,383
Sanitize the gloves
when you have the chance.

504
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:50,484
[voice becoming distant]
Keep your mask on.

505
00:25:50,518 --> 00:25:51,752
I know it...

finished it.</i>

Okay.</i>

513
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,968
<i>Wait.
Um...</i>

514
00:26:08,002 --> 00:26:09,803
<i>Okay.</i>

515
00:26:09,837 --> 00:26:12,607
<i>Amanda said...
to shoot my shot.</i>

516
00:26:12,641 --> 00:26:13,974
<i>Right?</i>

517
00:26:14,008 --> 00:26:15,476
<i>I mean, I guess
it couldn't hurt.</i>

518
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:17,878
<i>What do I say...?</i>

519
00:26:20,381 --> 00:26:21,882
Hey!

520
00:26:22,983 --> 00:26:24,518
Hey.

like the perfect man,</i>

694
00:34:23,296 --> 00:34:27,068
<i>but he could be, like,
a serial killer</i>

695
00:34:27,101 --> 00:34:30,738
<i>or worse... a scorpio.</i>

696
00:34:30,772 --> 00:34:33,708
[sighs] <i>Only one way
to find out though.</i>

697
00:34:36,276 --> 00:34:40,048
<i>I'd love it if my bangs could
just not look like barcodes.</i>

698
00:34:40,782 --> 00:34:42,215
<i>Gross.</i>

699
00:34:45,787 --> 00:34:46,988
[exhales]

700
00:34:50,692 --> 00:34:51,959
Hey!

701
00:34:51,993 --> 00:34:53,493
- Hey.
- Hey.

702
00:34:53,527 --> 00:34:55,163
- Oh, whoa, sorry, six feet.
- Oh, right, six feet.

703
00:34:55,195 --> 00:34:56,164
[both chuckle]

704
00:34:56,196 --> 00:34:57,597
How are you?

705
00:34:57,632 --> 00:34:59,533
I'm good, ya know?

706
00:34:59,566 --> 00:35:01,669
I just...

707
00:35:01,703 --> 00:35:04,304
Making like a plant
and photosynthesizing.

708
00:35:04,337 --> 00:35:05,773
[laughs]
Aren't we all?

709
00:35:05,807 --> 00:35:07,141
We're all plants.

710
00:35:07,175 --> 00:35:09,610
So glad to see
that you're a plant guy

711
00:35:09,644 --> 00:35:11,311
'cause I'm a plant girl.

712
00:35:11,344 --> 00:35:12,613
- Really?
- Yes!

713
00:35:12,647 --> 00:35:13,881
Wow, what's your favorite?

714
00:35:13,915 --> 00:35:16,684
Oh, um...

715
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:18,686
Just so many, I can't even
remember the names.

716
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,188
- It's, like, crazy.
- I know.

717
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,956
The names are hard.
I just like the shapes.

718
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:23,624
- The shapes are cool.
- Yeah, yeah.

719
00:35:23,658 --> 00:35:25,960
- I love your plants.
- Thanks!

720
00:35:25,993 --> 00:35:27,195
They're super sick.

721
00:35:27,227 --> 00:35:28,830
How long have you
been doing this?

722
00:35:28,863 --> 00:35:30,732
Oh, just from the start
of quarantine.

723
00:35:30,765 --> 00:35:32,532
No way, I would've thought
this was, like,

724
00:35:32,566 --> 00:35:33,835
a many years endeavor.

725
00:35:33,868 --> 00:35:35,703
- No, no, just started.
- Wow.

726
00:35:35,737 --> 00:35:37,004
[neighbor] I think they're
looking pretty good.

727
00:35:37,038 --> 00:35:38,840
I gotta cut a couple
in the back but...

728
00:35:38,873 --> 00:35:40,641
[Terese] <i>I wish it
weren't a pandemic</i>

729
00:35:40,675 --> 00:35:43,343
<i>so I could just ask him out.</i>

730
00:35:43,376 --> 00:35:45,312
<i>I guess that's not stopping
some people,</i>

731
00:35:45,345 --> 00:35:48,381
<i>but I'm not just some people.</i>

732
00:35:56,289 --> 00:35:58,192
[Terese]
<i>Yes.</i>

733
00:35:58,226 --> 00:36:01,394
<i>Yo, why would anyone
ever use a bowl?</i>

734
00:36:01,428 --> 00:36:02,997
<i>This is so efficient,</i>

735
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,633
<i>and it doesn't dirty
any dishes.</i>

736
00:36:06,934 --> 00:36:08,870
<i>Bowl, bowl.</i>

737
00:36:08,903 --> 00:36:10,938
<i>Should I smoke another bowl?</i>

738
00:36:11,939 --> 00:36:13,141
[laughs]

739
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:17,078
[laughs]

740
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,114
Mm.

741
00:36:20,148 --> 00:36:21,682
<i>Spoons are like small shovels.</i>

742
00:36:21,716 --> 00:36:23,350
<i>I never thought about that.</i>

743
00:36:23,818 --> 00:36:26,286
[footsteps]

744
00:36:33,426 --> 00:36:35,730
[Terese]
<i>Where are you going?</i>

745
00:36:35,763 --> 00:36:38,633
<i>What would you have
to look that nice for?</i>

746
00:36:43,671 --> 00:36:45,740
[keys jangle]

747
00:36:45,773 --> 00:36:48,009
[Terese] <i>What if she's
going to see someone?</i>

748
00:36:52,847 --> 00:36:54,115
[keys jangle]

749
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:57,484
[Terese]
<i>No.</i>

750
00:36:57,517 --> 00:36:59,921
<i>I'm way too high to talk
about this right now.</i>

751
00:36:59,954 --> 00:37:01,856
<i>I don't want any smoke tonight.</i>

752
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:04,225
- [door closes]
- <i>Except the weed kind.</i>

753
00:37:06,994 --> 00:37:09,730
[laughs]

754
00:37:09,764 --> 00:37:11,966
[coughing]

755
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,143
[door opening]

756
00:37:24,212 --> 00:37:25,246
[Terese]
<i>Hmm.</i>

757
00:37:25,279 --> 00:37:26,914
<i>She's been gone a while.</i>

758
00:37:26,948 --> 00:37:28,515
[man speaks indistinctly]

759
00:37:28,548 --> 00:37:31,285
[Amanda] Yeah, she's, like,
really strict, so...

760
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:33,321
[indistinct chatter]

761
00:37:33,353 --> 00:37:35,488
[tense music]

762
00:37:35,522 --> 00:37:36,991
[laughter]

763
00:37:38,558 --> 00:37:39,994
Who the fuck is that?

764
00:37:44,364 --> 00:37:46,000
I'm Sean.

765
00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:47,768
Hi.
Shut up.

766
00:37:47,802 --> 00:37:49,369
And get the fuck
out of my house.

767
00:37:49,402 --> 00:37:51,339
- Terese.
- No, keep the mask on!

768
00:37:51,371 --> 00:37:53,608
Why are you still here?
Get out of my house!

769
00:37:53,641 --> 00:37:55,877
Now, please.

770
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:58,713
What the... who was that?

771
00:37:58,746 --> 00:38:01,616
Um... Sean.

772
00:38:01,649 --> 00:38:03,851
Sean.
Sean who?

773
00:38:03,885 --> 00:38:06,087
I don't know.
I met him...

774
00:38:08,055 --> 00:38:09,190
online.

775
00:38:09,223 --> 00:38:10,457
[huffs]

776
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:12,860
You did not go on a Tinder date

777
00:38:12,894 --> 00:38:14,729
in a fucking pandemic.

778
00:38:14,762 --> 00:38:16,631
You told me to do what I had
to do to get over Zack.

779
00:38:16,664 --> 00:38:18,065
Oh, my God.

780
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:19,834
I meant, like, drink
a bottle of vodka and cry,

781
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:21,401
like egg his house,
harass him online,

782
00:38:21,434 --> 00:38:24,972
not bring some <i>fucker</i> named Sean
into my house!

783
00:38:25,538 --> 00:38:27,474
Our house.

784
00:38:27,507 --> 00:38:29,509
You're right.
I am so sorry.

785
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:30,912
We both live here.

786
00:38:30,945 --> 00:38:32,747
You just put us both at risk!

787
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,683
For what, stilted conversation
and a quick fuck?

788
00:38:35,716 --> 00:38:38,986
Amanda, in what world
was this okay?

789
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,689
We've only talked about, like,
wiping things down

790
00:38:41,722 --> 00:38:43,357
- and sticking to takeout...
- Oh, my God.

791
00:38:43,391 --> 00:38:46,894
I thought the "not mingling
with strangers" was implicit.

792
00:38:46,928 --> 00:38:48,663
He tested negative last week.

793
00:38:48,696 --> 00:38:51,431
He tested negative last week?

794
00:38:51,464 --> 00:38:53,834
Anything could've happened
within that last week,

795
00:38:53,868 --> 00:38:56,237
especially if he's going out
on random dates

796
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:57,838
during a pandemic!

797
00:38:57,872 --> 00:38:59,907
Well, we weren't, like,
coughing on each other.

798
00:38:59,941 --> 00:39:01,541
Are you a fucking idiot?

799
00:39:01,574 --> 00:39:02,677
Are you a fucking idiot?!

800
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,245
I know you're
from Arizona,

801
00:39:04,278 --> 00:39:06,347
but I thought you understood,
like, simple science.

802
00:39:07,547 --> 00:39:09,116
[Amanda sighs]

803
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,286
You're acting like I want
to give you COVID or something.

804
00:39:12,987 --> 00:39:16,691
You're not trying very hard
to prevent it.

805
00:39:16,724 --> 00:39:19,393
You can go out and be reckless
and irresponsible

806
00:39:19,427 --> 00:39:21,262
and probably get away with it
scot-free,

807
00:39:21,295 --> 00:39:22,964
but if you bring COVID
into this house,

808
00:39:22,997 --> 00:39:24,597
I could die.

809
00:39:32,006 --> 00:39:35,676
A ventilator may have always
been part of my future,

810
00:39:37,011 --> 00:39:39,579
but if you're going
to live here with me,

811
00:39:39,613 --> 00:39:40,915
I need you to make sure
it doesn't become

812
00:39:40,948 --> 00:39:42,984
part of my present.

813
00:39:44,618 --> 00:39:45,853
Okay.

814
00:39:46,821 --> 00:39:49,190
CF is a lung disease.

815
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:54,561
If I get COVID,
I could be done for.

816
00:39:54,594 --> 00:39:56,731
This is so serious.

817
00:39:57,665 --> 00:39:59,133
I'm sorry.

818
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:02,103
This must be so hard for you.
I can't imagine.

819
00:40:02,136 --> 00:40:03,938
[Terese sighs]

820
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:05,373
Well try to.

821
00:40:07,274 --> 00:40:09,477
And we need to both quarantine
in our rooms

822
00:40:09,509 --> 00:40:11,979
until you can get tested.

823
00:40:18,686 --> 00:40:20,187
[sighs]

824
00:40:20,654 --> 00:40:22,023
[door closes]

825
00:40:23,523 --> 00:40:26,427
[light rock music]

826
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,996
[Terese] <i>As if I weren't
confined enough.</i>

827
00:40:31,832 --> 00:40:34,035
[vocalizing in song]

828
00:40:59,727 --> 00:41:02,196
[music continues]

829
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,254
[door closes]

830
00:41:33,861 --> 00:41:35,229
[Amanda] Hey.

831
00:41:36,197 --> 00:41:37,565
Don't worry.

832
00:41:37,597 --> 00:41:39,400
Um, I just wanted
to let you know

833
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:42,036
that my test came back negative.

834
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:44,205
[Terese] That's lucky.

835
00:41:44,238 --> 00:41:45,539
Yeah.

836
00:41:45,573 --> 00:41:47,675
And for what it's worth,

837
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:50,444
Sean also tested negative.

838
00:41:50,478 --> 00:41:53,247
He sent me a screenshot
when he asked me out again.

839
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,916
Well, have fun with that.

840
00:41:57,585 --> 00:41:59,854
I'm not gonna go out
with him again.

841
00:42:00,788 --> 00:42:04,325
You were right.
It was a stupid thing to do.

842
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:08,162
I was just so upset over Zack.

843
00:42:09,797 --> 00:42:11,765
But I finally called him,

844
00:42:11,799 --> 00:42:14,635
and we had a really good talk.

845
00:42:14,668 --> 00:42:16,637
Uh, we're back together.

846
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:19,573
Or still together.

847
00:42:19,608 --> 00:42:22,810
But I think I'm gonna start
staying there again.

848
00:42:22,843 --> 00:42:24,445
Oh, that is so good!

849
00:42:24,478 --> 00:42:26,780
I... that... that's so good
for you guys.

850
00:42:26,814 --> 00:42:30,117
Like, I'm so happy for you guys.

851
00:42:30,151 --> 00:42:31,485
- Wow.
- Yeah.

852
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:34,121
Um, I think it's for the best.

853
00:42:34,155 --> 00:42:35,856
[Terese] Yeah.

854
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:39,160
I'm sorry I made you feel
so unsafe.

855
00:42:39,827 --> 00:42:41,662
I don't wanna
stress you out anymore.

856
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,832
Plus I miss him so much.

857
00:42:44,865 --> 00:42:47,601
It is so hard being lonely
in these times.

858
00:42:47,636 --> 00:42:49,970
[laughs]

859
00:42:50,004 --> 00:42:52,072
Don't I know it.
[laughs]

860
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,909
Okay.
Uh, I'm gonna go pack.

861
00:42:54,942 --> 00:42:57,011
Yes, yeah.
Go pack.

862
00:42:58,546 --> 00:43:00,514
Go... go pack, girl.

863
00:43:03,017 --> 00:43:04,351

[footsteps]

865
00:43:08,756 --> 00:43:11,258
- I'm gonna head out.
- [Terese] Okay, cool.

[keys jangle]

867
00:43:14,228 --> 00:43:16,430

- Bye.

[man] <i>Hello, LA County
testing site.</i>

1214
01:02:08,529 --> 01:02:10,931
- <i>This is Terrence.</i>
- Yeah, hi.

1215
01:02:10,964 --> 01:02:13,967
Um, I got tested on Thursday,

1216
01:02:14,001 --> 01:02:16,036
and I still haven't gotten
my results.

1217
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:17,438
[Terrence] <i>Okay, yeah,
so we're pretty overwhelmed</i>

1218
01:02:17,471 --> 01:02:18,839
<i>at the moment.</i>

1219
01:02:18,872 --> 01:02:19,973
<i>I can't look
into anything for you</i>

1220
01:02:20,007 --> 01:02:21,842
<i>unless it's been seven days.</i>

1221
01:02:23,544 --> 01:02:25,613
Yeah, I just feel really awful,

1222
01:02:25,647 --> 01:02:29,617
and I really need to know
if I have COVID.

1223
01:02:29,651 --> 01:02:32,186
[Terrence] <i>Yeah, well,
if your symptoms worsen,</i>

1224
01:02:32,219 --> 01:02:33,954
<i>you should seek
professional help</i>

1225
01:02:33,987 --> 01:02:35,923
<i>and go to an ER
if you start...</i>

1226

1227
01:02:36,957 --> 01:02:37,991
Yeah, thanks, Terrence.

1228
01:02:38,025 --> 01:02:39,694
Really fucking helpful.

1229
01:02:42,463 --> 01:02:44,031
[sighs]

1230
01:02:44,064 --> 01:02:46,533
I probably should have said
that last part in my head.

[stomach gurgling]

01:02:57,911 --> 01:02:59,714
Aww.
Poor baby.

1234
01:02:59,748 --> 01:03:01,115
Are you drunk?

1235
01:03:01,148 --> 01:03:02,784
No.
[gasps]

1236
01:03:02,817 --> 01:03:05,085
- Gas station sushi.
- [laughs]

1237
01:03:05,886 --> 01:03:07,488
Can I help you?

1238
01:03:07,521 --> 01:03:08,989
Or do you need... I don't know...

1239
01:03:09,022 --> 01:03:10,825
do you need more soy sauce,
wasabi?

1240
01:03:10,859 --> 01:03:11,925
[Terese groans]

1241
01:03:11,959 --> 01:03:13,527

my life how I wanted to,</i>

1252
01:03:46,026 --> 01:03:48,595
<i>it would be worth
it in the end.</i>

1253

Ow.

[Terese]
<i>Okay.</i>

1268
01:05:18,051 --> 01:05:20,420
<i>Okay, I was only out
for two minutes.</i>

1269
01:05:20,454 --> 01:05:22,189
<i>That's not too bad.</i>

1270
01:05:23,457 --> 01:05:26,560
<i>Or is it?
Oh, fuck.</i>

1271
01:05:27,461 --> 01:05:29,429

[phone vibrating]

1273
01:05:36,738 --> 01:05:38,272
Hello?

1274
01:05:38,305 --> 01:05:40,340
[Dr. Samuels] <i>Hello.
This is Dr. Samuels.</i>

1275
01:05:40,374 --> 01:05:43,510
<i>I'm on call tonight.
What seems to be the issue?</i>

1276
01:05:43,544 --> 01:05:46,848
Hello, uh, yeah,
I think I have COVID.

1277
01:05:46,881 --> 01:05:48,582
[Dr. Samuels] <i>Have you
been tested?</i>

1278
01:05:49,082 --> 01:05:51,051
Uh, yeah, about a week ago.

1279
01:05:51,084 --> 01:05:52,921
It hasn't come back yet.

1280
01:05:53,988 --> 01:05:57,524
Um, but I've had a fever
and symptoms all week.

1281
01:05:57,558 --> 01:06:01,495
Um, and I have a really tight
pressure on my chest.

1282
01:06:01,528 --> 01:06:04,032
Um, and my hands are tingly.

1283
01:06:04,064 --> 01:06:07,200
And I think I just passed out.

1284
01:06:07,234 --> 01:06:08,535
[Dr. Samuels] <i>You think?</i>

1285
01:06:11,505 --> 01:06:14,008
I did.
I did.

1286
01:06:14,042 --> 01:06:16,209
[Dr. Samuels] <i>And you're
a CF patient, right?</i>

1287
01:06:17,879 --> 01:06:21,015
- Yes
- [Dr. Samuels] <i>Okay.</i>

1288
01:06:21,049 --> 01:06:22,817
<i>I think we should bring you in
to check you out</i>

1289
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:24,719
<i>and see if you need
to be admitted.</i>

1290
01:06:24,752 --> 01:06:26,654
<i>We'll be able to test you
again for COVID</i>

1291
01:06:26,688 --> 01:06:28,355
<i>as well as a fall flu panel.</i>

1292
01:06:28,388 --> 01:06:31,158
<i>But you just passed out,
so I wouldn't recommend</i>

1293
01:06:31,191 --> 01:06:33,695
<i>for you to operate
a vehicle right now.</i>

1294
01:06:33,728 --> 01:06:36,430
<i>Do you have anyone who could
bring you to the hospital?</i>

1295
01:06:45,305 --> 01:06:46,641
[sighs]

1296
01:07:00,922 --> 01:07:02,322
Why didn't you tell me?

1297
01:07:04,558 --> 01:07:06,293
That you were sick?

1298
01:07:09,329 --> 01:07:11,198
I didn't tell anyone.

1299
01:07:12,232 --> 01:07:15,069
Well, except Syd.

1300
01:07:15,103 --> 01:07:18,271
[Amanda sighs]
It must be so scary for you.

1301
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:24,444
Yeah.
It is.

1302
01:07:25,245 --> 01:07:27,982
That's partially why
I didn't tell anyone

1303
01:07:28,016 --> 01:07:32,053
because everyone telling me
how scary it is

1304
01:07:32,086 --> 01:07:34,287
doesn't make it any less scary.

1305
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:38,191
Sorry.

1306
01:07:39,127 --> 01:07:40,662
[Terese sighs]

1307
01:07:40,695 --> 01:07:42,162
It's okay.

1308
01:07:47,501 --> 01:07:49,469
Why didn't you tell me
about Zack

1309
01:07:49,503 --> 01:07:51,238
right when you got back?

1310
01:07:52,607 --> 01:07:55,009
Uh...

1311
01:07:55,043 --> 01:07:58,278
I thought that

1312
01:07:58,311 --> 01:08:03,117
if I made a big deal out of it,
then it would have been real.

1313
01:08:03,151 --> 01:08:05,419
And also... [laughs]...

1314
01:08:05,452 --> 01:08:07,254
we don't talk.

1315
01:08:09,456 --> 01:08:10,958
We could.

1316
01:08:10,992 --> 01:08:13,161
Could we?

1317
01:08:13,193 --> 01:08:14,996
I know I didn't know you
that well

1318
01:08:15,029 --> 01:08:16,764
before I moved in,

1319
01:08:16,798 --> 01:08:21,201
but you never tried very hard
to change that.

1320
01:08:21,803 --> 01:08:25,272
And then things got so tense
when I came back from Zack's.

1321
01:08:28,676 --> 01:08:31,879
You just... didn't understand.

1322
01:08:31,913 --> 01:08:33,781
[Amanda scoffs understandingly]

1323
01:08:33,815 --> 01:08:36,450
[Amanda] You're right.
I didn't un...

1324
01:08:36,483 --> 01:08:38,418
I don't understand.

1325
01:08:40,487 --> 01:08:44,591
You've always acted like CF
was no big deal.

1326
01:08:46,928 --> 01:08:49,529
You never actually told me
what it was.

1327
01:08:53,901 --> 01:08:57,205
I'm not good at, like,
explaining the science of it.

1328
01:08:59,907 --> 01:09:02,977
And you're not even
from Arizona.

1329
01:09:03,010 --> 01:09:07,380
[both laughing]

1330
01:09:09,382 --> 01:09:12,419
Sorry.
Sorry about that.

1331
01:09:12,452 --> 01:09:14,889
Um...
[laughs]

1332
01:09:19,426 --> 01:09:21,229
I guess I just...

1333
01:09:22,395 --> 01:09:26,734
I envy how little you have
to care about all of this.

1334
01:09:29,402 --> 01:09:31,038
I know.

1335
01:09:31,072 --> 01:09:34,374
I wish I could go out
and see my friends.

1336
01:09:34,407 --> 01:09:37,344
Go to restaurants
and just...

1337
01:09:37,377 --> 01:09:41,314
feel invincible like
everybody else I know.

1338
01:09:42,415 --> 01:09:43,951
But I'm not.

1339
01:09:45,318 --> 01:09:48,355
I've never been invincible.

1340
01:09:49,824 --> 01:09:51,424
Especially now.

1341
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:57,364
[Amanda sighs]

1342
01:09:57,397 --> 01:09:59,767
[Terese] Bye.
Thanks again.

[doctor] <i>Your oxygen
and EKG look good,</i>

1347
01:10:07,942 --> 01:10:09,811
<i>and your chest x-ray
is actually better</i>

01:10:09,844 --> 01:10:11,179
<i>than the last time you had one.</i>

1349
01:10:11,212 --> 01:10:12,713
[Terese] <i>Okay.</i>

1350
01:10:12,747 --> 01:10:14,414
[doctor] <i>So I feel fine
to send you home.</i>

1351
01:10:14,447 --> 01:10:16,383
<i>You probably passed out
from dehydration.</i>

1352
01:10:16,416 --> 01:10:18,219
<i>Just keep drinking plenty
of fluids.</i>

1353
01:10:18,252 --> 01:10:19,720
<i>We should have
your results tomorrow.</i>

1354
01:10:19,754 --> 01:10:21,088
<i>Someone from the clinic
will call you,</i>

1355
01:10:21,122 --> 01:10:22,290
<i>and we will go from there.</i>

1356
01:10:22,322 --> 01:10:24,091
[Terese] <i>Okay.
Thank you.</i>

Hello?

[Angela] <i>Hey, Terese.</i>

1362
01:10:54,354 --> 01:10:56,824
<i>It's Angela from the CF Clinic.</i>

1363
01:10:56,858 --> 01:10:58,926
<i>How are you doing?</i>

1364
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,629
Um, I'm all right.
I'm tired.

1365
01:11:01,662 --> 01:11:03,164
[Angela] <i>Yeah.</i>

1366
01:11:03,197 --> 01:11:05,299
<i>I heard you had a late night
at ATC.</i>

1367
01:11:05,333 --> 01:11:08,269
<i>That's why I'm calling.
Your test results came back!</i>

1368
01:11:08,302 --> 01:11:12,673
<i>And let me just
pull them up here...</i>

1369
01:11:12,707 --> 01:11:14,141
<i>Let's see.</i>

1370
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:17,178
<i>I think it's in here...</i>

1371
01:11:17,211 --> 01:11:19,512
<i>And you are...</i>

1372
01:11:19,546 --> 01:11:21,816
<i>negative for COVID!</i>

1373
01:11:21,849 --> 01:11:23,383
Oh, my God.

1374
01:11:24,652 --> 01:11:26,254
Oh, my God.

1375
01:11:27,154 --> 01:11:28,488
Oh, my God, so what do I have?

1376
01:11:28,521 --> 01:11:30,024
What's wrong with me?

1377
01:11:30,057 --> 01:11:34,161
[Angela] <i>You did test positive
for rhinovirus.</i>

1378
01:11:34,195 --> 01:11:35,796
Rhinovirus?

1379
01:11:37,031 --> 01:11:39,033
[Syd] <i>You had a cold?</i>

1380
01:11:39,066 --> 01:11:40,735
[Terese coughing]
Yeah.

1381
01:11:40,768 --> 01:11:43,304
I just had a fucking cold!

1382
01:11:43,337 --> 01:11:44,906
Just a fucking cold.

1383
01:11:44,939 --> 01:11:47,742
Worst cold of my life,
but, like, it wasn't COVID.

1384
01:11:47,775 --> 01:11:49,010
Yet.

1385
01:11:49,043 --> 01:11:50,211
