Bye babe.

I'm sorry.

193

Hey.

194

Look's good, dude.

195

- Hi Kenny.

Oh, hi.

That's a pretty name.

Let me know if you need
anything.

207
00:11:19,161 --> 00:11:21,263
I pretty much run this place.

208
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:27,670
Do you like surfing?

209
00:11:27,702 --> 00:11:29,071
I got bit by a shark
a few years ago.

210
00:11:29,104 --> 00:11:29,972
Wanna see the scar?

211
00:11:30,004 --> 00:11:31,105
Wow.

212
00:11:31,138 --> 00:11:32,674
Kenny 45 seconds in,

213
00:11:32,707 --> 00:11:34,609
you're already talking about
the shark bite.

214
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:35,710
She's off limits, bro.

215
00:11:35,744 --> 00:11:37,345
Hey, she's fine.

216

You're the one that said
watch out for Kenny.

217
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:40,849
She what?

218
00:11:40,882 --> 00:11:42,718
- I'm done.
- Fine.

219
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,818
You need to chill?

220
00:11:43,851 --> 00:11:45,854
You are just bad energy.

Bro, it is good to see you.

Man, costing me millions.

You still looking like the MVP

I've got something that'll
cheer you up.

230
00:12:02,704 --> 00:12:03,239
Now come on.

231
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:10,178
Wait till I show you this.

232
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:12,981
Man, I just got this bottle

Boy, I'm telling you,

238
00:12:20,088 --> 00:12:21,724
I knew you'd enjoy that.

239
00:12:21,757 --> 00:12:23,758

240
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:24,792
What do you wanna show us?

241
00:12:24,825 --> 00:12:27,329
Oh,
well actually that's exactly

242
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:28,830
what I wanted to toast about.

243
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:30,733
So look, I want you guys to be

244
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:31,867

Who's thirsty?

249
00:12:37,873 --> 00:12:40,175
You, you look like you need
a drink.

250
00:12:40,207 --> 00:12:42,143
Huh, I don't think so.

- Come on, let her loosen up.
- [Carl] Yeah.

252
00:12:44,378 --> 00:12:45,848
She's not 21.

253
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,848
Okay.

254
00:12:46,882 --> 00:12:49,852
Party pooper.

255
00:12:49,884 --> 00:12:52,854
Baby, I wanna play the new track
for them.

256
00:12:52,888 --> 00:12:54,657
Can you grab my laptop
from upstairs

257
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,724
and bring it back down please?

258
00:12:55,757 --> 00:12:56,992
Okay.

259
00:12:57,024 --> 00:12:59,394
Yo, I'm telling you
this song is sick.

260
00:12:59,427 --> 00:13:00,428
I'm smelling number one
with this one.

261
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:01,396
Seriously.

262
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,767
I mean, Trinity has been working
her ass off.

263
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,234
She's unbelievable.

264
00:13:06,268 --> 00:13:09,171
Just I feel so blessed.

265
00:13:10,272 --> 00:13:13,042
Hey Sis, you a Trinity Lee fan
or what?

266
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:17,679
No, it's not my scene.

267
00:13:18,747 --> 00:13:20,049
Okay.

it and it was not there.

That hard drive is worth more

Alright,

and what you did after
you left the studio.

Nowhere I came home.

282
00:13:57,885 --> 00:13:59,020
And you didn't go anywhere else?

283
00:13:59,053 --> 00:14:01,422
No, I came straight home.

284
00:14:01,455 --> 00:14:04,325
Wait, actually I stopped
and got gas,

285
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:07,362
but that's it.

286
00:14:07,394 --> 00:14:09,097
Where else did you go?

287
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,999
Nowhere.

288
00:14:12,032 --> 00:14:13,502

Yeah.

302
00:15:01,215 --> 00:15:02,884
Actually Becky used it once.

Didn't you Bec?

304
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,255
She got her phone back.

00:15:07,955 --> 00:15:09,859
It's your phone?

307
00:15:14,528 --> 00:15:17,499
[Becca] Yes,
he that's took at school and I drove

308
00:15:17,532 --> 00:15:20,168
to their house and wouldn't
leave until they gave it

309
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:21,336
back to me.

Dude, I've never seen this place
before in my life.

I've no idea what that is.

316
00:15:41,322 --> 00:15:43,024
Yeah,
well you are going to go get it.

No matter what it takes, man,

318
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,360
I need you to bring that
back here.

00:15:52,901 --> 00:15:54,303
Get outta here.

323
00:15:57,571 --> 00:15:59,508
Leave my phone, dumbass.

324
00:16:03,143 --> 00:16:05,147
That's really harsh.

325
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,849
He's always doing this.

326
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,450
He's such a fuck up.

327
00:16:08,483 --> 00:16:11,286
Okay, but he's your friend
and he's loyal.

328
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:12,387
He seemed to forget that
and take that

329
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,289
for granted sometimes.

330
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:16,357
Like he's always there for you.

331
00:16:17,325 --> 00:16:19,161
It's like having a child.

00:16:21,595 --> 00:16:22,864
Okay.

get my friend.
