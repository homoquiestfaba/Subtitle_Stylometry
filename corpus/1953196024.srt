354
00:57:22,653 --> 00:57:24,911
you're never gonna make it in time.

355
00:57:33,634 --> 00:57:36,132
You children are bad seeds, Jimmy.

356
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:43,804
and now you're gonna reap
what sow.

357
00:57:46,049 --> 00:57:48,719
Nathan never heard of sow.

358
00:57:49,295 --> 00:57:51,393
A mother knows her children, Jimmy.

359
00:57:57,541 --> 00:58:00,303
You remember those bed time stories
I used to tell you.

360
00:58:05,321 --> 00:58:06,910
Like Hansel and Gretel.

361
00:58:10,507 --> 00:58:12,607
Those were bad kids, Jimmy.

362
00:58:14,868 --> 00:58:18,952
They lied and they stole.

363
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,971
You remember what happended
at the end?

364
00:58:27,744 --> 00:58:30,694
- How it ended?
- Yeah, I remember.

365
00:58:35,923 --> 00:58:38,245
The witch got barbecued.

366
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:01,952
Jimmy let me out of here!

367
00:59:03,268 --> 00:59:03,990
No.

368
00:59:04,984 --> 00:59:05,810
Jimmy!

369
00:59:08,431 --> 00:59:10,627
Jimmy, you open this door.

370
00:59:16,342 --> 00:59:19,307
When I'll get out of here,
you're gonna be in a world of pain.

371
00:59:20,352 --> 00:59:21,544
Open the door!

372
00:59:21,779 --> 00:59:25,221
Good luck! I kept sammy in there
for three hours before.

373
00:59:28,425 --> 00:59:30,879
I'm scared, Jimmy.

374
00:59:33,638 --> 00:59:35,658
Don't leave me here alone.

375
00:59:38,149 --> 00:59:40,427
Don't leave me in here, Jimmy.

376
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,594
Jimmy!

377
01:00:26,899 --> 01:00:29,927

385
01:01:45,064 --> 01:01:47,509
It's past your bed time Jimmy.

01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,917
You're gonna say the prayers now.

387
01:01:50,856 --> 01:01:52,234
Look at me.

388
01:01:53,528 --> 01:01:55,787
- Come on.
- No, please mom.

389
01:01:55,862 --> 01:01:57,129
- Give me your hand.

390
01:01:57,534 --> 01:01:58,540
- Give me your hand!

391
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,095
Okay, it's okay.

392
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:06,395
We're gonna stop it now.

393
01:02:15,918 --> 01:02:20,384
- Now I let me down to sleep

I pray the lord!

399
01:02:34,373 --> 01:02:36,022

01:03:20,356 --> 01:03:22,377
No mom, please.

There's my boy, now come on.

404
01:05:23,192 --> 01:05:24,970
In the long buddy.

405
01:05:36,547 --> 01:05:38,425
Who left the oven on.

406
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,502
You're gonna burn this place down.

407
01:05:59,144 --> 01:06:00,781
You will dare.

408
01:06:02,146 --> 01:06:05,524
Jimmy!

409
01:06:10,094 --> 01:06:12,625
Mamma told you not to play
with matches now.

410
01:06:19,969 --> 01:06:22,446

420
01:08:23,897 --> 01:08:25,559
Hang on son, help is on the way.

421
01:08:25,594 --> 01:08:27,081
- May day, please...

422
01:09:11,024 --> 01:09:14,769
patient is a Caucasian female,
age 32

423
01:09:14,804 --> 01:09:16,852
Sufferig from a psychotic break.

424
01:09:17,215 --> 01:09:19,290
Secondary the postpartum psychosis

425
01:09:19,346 --> 01:09:22,740
Due to her physical condition
she's been removed from

426
01:09:22,921 --> 01:09:24,968
Forasine and other anti-psychotics

427
01:09:25,003 --> 01:09:28,931
While continuing to under go
a battery of psychological testing

428
01:09:29,013 --> 01:09:33,897
- Can I get to leave today?
- Let's take a seat a second.

429
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,142
The doctor says yes,

430
01:09:37,177 --> 01:09:40,066
But we gotta have an important
man-to-man first.

431
01:09:44,976 --> 01:09:46,999
It's about your mother.

432
01:09:50,771 --> 01:09:52,849
I know how you feel

433
01:09:54,145 --> 01:09:57,197
but the doctors've had helped
me understand is that...

434
01:09:57,332 --> 01:10:00,167
It wasn't your mother that was
doing those things at the night.

435
01:10:00,762 --> 01:10:03,428
Let's say she was sick, Jimmy.

436
01:10:03,645 --> 01:10:05,881
and the doctor say that with
enough treatment...

437
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:07,781
- she's gonna be herself again.
- Dad no,

438
01:10:07,938 --> 01:10:10,168
Dad they can't let her out.
She'll kill me.

439
01:10:10,184 --> 01:10:15,198
- She won't stop till I'm dead.
- No son, the court's explained

440
01:10:15,355 --> 01:10:19,041
and the doctors did too.
It wasn't her that was doing
those things.

441
01:10:23,229 --> 01:10:30,137
Listen, I know you might not
wanna hear this right now,

442
01:10:30,705 --> 01:10:35,357
But when your mother is healthy,
I want her to come home.

443
01:10:37,927 --> 01:10:41,817
I know it's hard, but I'm only
asking of you Cheif is,

444
01:10:42,629 --> 01:10:44,096
that's a try.

445
01:10:45,670 --> 01:10:47,229
Think you can do that?

446
01:10:50,176 --> 01:10:52,261
That's my good boy.

447
01:10:53,859 --> 01:10:56,469
Come on here, come on.

448
01:11:01,545 --> 01:11:03,625
Your mother was pregnant,
Jimmy.

449
01:11:06,070 --> 01:11:08,709
and it's a miracle that baby
survived.

450
01:11:10,431 --> 01:11:13,120
You're gonna be a big brother
again.

451
01:11:14,066 --> 01:11:16,833
And we all are gonna be a
family.

452
01:11:28,287 --> 01:11:32,809
