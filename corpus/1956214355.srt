1
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,706
Gordon ...!

2
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,975
Yeah, what, Smiley?

3
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,345
Where the hell is everybody?

4
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:40,980
Spring Break, man. There's still
a few of the guys around

5
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,683
because of the game. Everybody
else is gone til next week.

6
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,818
Yeah, well, that's great, except
I got stuck writing this tenth

7
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,820
anniversary essay for
the fraternity.

8
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,557
So?

9
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,559
"So?" You told me we'd all
pitch in on this.

10
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:54,961
Why do I have to
do it by myself?

11
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:57,330
I thought you were the brains of
this outfit?

12
00:19:57,364 --> 00:20:00,267
Apparently not. You know this
counts as part of our review,

13
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,303
right? If I don't get it done on
time, they cut our funding.

14
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:05,805
Talk to Andrew.

15
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:08,007
When did we all start taking
orders from Andrew?

16
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,477
Since always. He's the head of
the fraternity, man.

17
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,012
Well, I didn't vote for him ...

18
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,548
Guess what? I'm going swimming.

19
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,717
Gordon ...

20
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,987
I hate Spring
Break ...

21
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:43,276
(Knocking)

22
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,578
Hello ...?

23
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:50,417
Smiley, if that's you, I'm still
not helping you with that

24
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,719
essay! Cowboy up, dude!

25
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:30,589
Gordon ...

26
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:33,660
Hello ...?

27
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:44,804
Why won't you play with me,
Gordon?

28
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:47,373
Okay, what's up with the
Peeping Tom routine?

29
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:53,079
Well, whoever you are, I hope
you like what you see..

30
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:59,505
(SCREAMS)

31
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:45,484
Huhhh..

32
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:51,250
Huhhh..

33
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:54,486
That was so not funny, Kels!

34
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,356
Not from where I'm standing ...!

35
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:59,525
What are you looking for?

36
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:01,860
A puddle!

37
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:04,163
Are we done now?

38
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:10,502
Come on man. I'm sorry I gotta
amuse myself somehow ...

39
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:12,638
Glad you have some free time
on your hands.

40
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:16,943
What's wrong, little
buddy?

41
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:19,211
Knock it off, huh? I'm serious.
I got stuck writing

42
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:21,513
the essay for the
frat committee.

43
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:24,483
Ohh, that ten-year
anniversary thing?

44
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:27,286
How did you get that gig?

45
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:29,555
Because everyone else
either went home or

46
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:31,958
decided to hide
out from me.

47
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:34,226
So Anyways, if you're just
sitting around bored,

48
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,628
maybe you could ...

49
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:38,998
Uh-uh, man, I would but uh, I
got a month's worth of

50
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:41,367
laundry to take care of before a
stroke of lightning strikes and

51
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,569
brings it to life or something.
How about some one else?

52
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:47,539
I know Andrew's still here, so
are Brad, Liam,

53
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:51,010
Cliff, Dude get Gordon ...

54
00:31:51,043 --> 00:31:53,112
Well, I already tried Gordon,
but he blew me off to go

55
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:55,414
swimming.

56
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:57,483
No he didn't. I was just at the
pool. and theres

57
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:59,952
No one is there.

58
00:31:59,986 --> 00:32:02,288
Well, somebody's gonna help me.

59
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:04,556
Well how hard could it be to
write about this place? Some

60
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,559
rich guy builds a mansion,
decides to donate it to the

61
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:10,396
fraternity a month later. The
end. Add some paragraphs

62
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,265
about rich people boom
your done.

63
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:15,667
It's not that simple.

64
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:18,104
Sounds pretty simple.

65
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:20,272
You know about
the place that was

66
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:22,241
here before the
mansion was built?

67
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,510
A national park?

68
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:26,979
Try an insane asylum.

69
00:32:27,013 --> 00:32:29,148
What?

70
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:31,317
Yeah. Some kind of sanitorium.
I couldn't believe it, either,

71
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,253
but I just read it in my copies
of the public records ...

72
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:37,523
So, what happened to the
sanitorium?

73
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:40,126
Well, I didn't get exactly to
that part, because you

74
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,394
decided to mess with me.

75
00:32:42,428 --> 00:32:44,496
Wait, Just now, you were
reading? 'Cause that didn't look

76
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:47,099
like "reading" to me.

77
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:50,502
No, I meant, up in my room ...
Look, anyways, What's

78
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:54,006
important someone else
besides me is gonna work on

79
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,276
this. Or else I'm gonna go
swimming and let you guys

80
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:00,546
worry about the frat
losing it's sponsorship.

81
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:05,151
Ok Fine, if I run into anybody
else on my way to the laundry

82
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:08,687
room, I'll send them your way.
That's the best I can do.

83
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,658
Gee, I don't want to put you
out or anything ...

84
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:16,328
Hey, Don't mention it!
Man!

85
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:22,168
You don't get enough
of this at practice?

86
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:25,071
No way, man. They postponed
the game, I'm taking advantage

87
00:33:25,104 --> 00:33:27,306
of the extra down time.

88
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,575
I'd rather have gone on Spring
Break. A bunch of us were

89
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:33,145
gonna go down to Costa Rica .

90
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,816
No offense, Brad, but the last
time you guys went down there,

91
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,419
two of you came
back in handcuffs.

92
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:42,821
And no regrets.

93
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,291
I'll tell you what. We win this
game, I'll pay for

94
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:47,726
everybody to go to Costa Rica.

95
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,097
Then, I suggest somebody get
out their checkbook.

96
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:54,700
You sure talk a good game.

97
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:57,203
Somebody needs to take
you down a peg.

98
00:33:57,236 --> 00:33:59,638
Anytime you feel froggy ...

99
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:11,117
You give?

100
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:14,286
Yeah, ease up! The last thing
I need before the

101
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,523
game is a dislocated shoulder!

102
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:20,126
I could have had you.

103
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,528
Yeah. Yeah "Could have".

104
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,830
Well, while I can still move,
I'm gonna hit the weights.

105
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:28,434
Nice practicing with ya.

106
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:03,401
Crap! What are
you doing in here?

107
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:08,774
Don't tell me you've been in
here the whole time!

108
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:14,713
You okay, man?

109
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:19,117
Join us, Kelso. Let us show
you how dark it is down here ...

110
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,853
What are you talking about?

111
00:40:21,887 --> 00:40:24,189
Join us ...

112
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:26,658
What the hell is
wrong with you?!?

113
00:40:38,637 --> 00:40:40,639
Don't fight it, Kelso ...

114
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:10,268
Oh !!

115
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,771
Please tell me this
is a joke ...

116
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,262
Entre'.

117
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,201
Sorry to disturb you,
my liege.

118
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:46,772
Oooo, nice!

119
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,743
What the hell do you
want, Smiley?

120
00:41:51,777 --> 00:41:54,279
Some help, for openers.

121
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:57,048
So ... what's that?

122
00:41:57,082 --> 00:41:59,818
What's this?!? It's the essay
that everybody else blew off!

123
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,754
What the hell do you want
me to do about it?

124
00:42:02,788 --> 00:42:05,624
Well, as head of the fraternity,
I figured you'd kind of be

125
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:07,959
interested in, you know,
not losing it ...

126
00:42:07,993 --> 00:42:10,161
Again, what do you want
me to do about it?

127
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:12,297
Some help would be nice.

128
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,700
A bunch of the guys are
hanging around for that game.

129
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:16,935
Why don't you ask one of them?

130
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:19,170
I tried that. Gordon's busy,
Kelso's busy, Brad and Liam

131
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:21,172
are supposedly off practicing
somewhere, I don't even know

132
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,575
where Cliff or Davis are ...

133
00:42:23,609 --> 00:42:25,711
Don't look at me. I don't "do"
essays.

134
00:42:25,744 --> 00:42:27,946
What makes you
think I do?

135
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:30,148
Aren't you the brains of
this outfit?

136
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:32,317
Why does everybody keep
saying that?

137
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:35,020
What do you need me for? You can
bang this out in like an hour.

138
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:37,288
See, that's what I thought.
Turns, out, this place has a

139
00:42:37,322 --> 00:42:40,158
really wild history. Remember
the old sanitorium outside of

140
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:42,694
of town?

141
00:42:42,728 --> 00:42:44,696
Yeah, the freaky old hospital
they had to close down

142
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:47,098
back in the Eighties?

143
00:42:47,132 --> 00:42:50,235
It burnt down. Anyway, guess
what they built in its place?

144
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:55,173
Here? Are you serious?

145
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:58,209
I haven't gotten to the good
part, yet. You know when the

146
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:01,312
hospital burnt down?
Twenty-five years ago today.

147
00:43:01,346 --> 00:43:03,982
This place ain't twenty-five
years old.

148
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:07,653
Yeah. It was just an empty lot
for fifteen years. Nobody

149
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:11,089
wanted anything to do with it.
Then, some rich dude builds

150
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:14,159
This place. A mansion here and
abandons it a month later,

151
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:17,028
no explanation, no nothing.
He sells it off for a

152
00:43:17,062 --> 00:43:19,297
quarter of the market value,
which is how the Beta Beta

153
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,900
Sigma got it.

154
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:24,102
I heard one of the patients was
locked in a closet and got burnt

155
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:26,304
up in the fire. Maybe
it was just bad karma?

156
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:28,674
There's nothing in the public
records.

157
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:30,642
Okay, so there used to be a
loony bin here. So what?

158
00:43:30,676 --> 00:43:33,178
So what's the big deal?

159
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:35,914
What am I supposed to do,
write an essay about the mental

160
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,249
hospital that used to be here?
The committee wants a fluff

161
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:41,119
piece, not an expose' ...

162
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:43,922
I'm sure you'll figure out
something. You're a bright guy.

163
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,324
I'm coming back here after
your little game.

164
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:49,661
Look, man, you get this done
for us.. I'll owe you big. You

165
00:43:49,695 --> 00:43:51,897
name it. I'll give you a free
backrub.

166
00:44:00,939 --> 00:44:03,675
What?!?

167
00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:05,677
Cliff buddy, I need you. I got
a big essay to write!

168
00:44:05,711 --> 00:44:08,179
I'm sleeping!

169
00:44:08,213 --> 00:44:10,682
It's half-past noon!

170
00:44:10,716 --> 00:44:13,051
I had a rough night
last night!

171
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:15,220
I'm not writing this essay by
myself, you hear me?

172
00:44:15,253 --> 00:44:17,789
I need your help!

173
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:20,191
I thought you were the brains of
this outfit?

174
00:44:20,225 --> 00:44:22,794
I'm gonna strangle the
next person who says that!

175
00:44:22,828 --> 00:44:24,730
I need some "me time". As soon
as I get up,

176
00:44:24,763 --> 00:44:27,265
I swear I'll pitch in!

177
00:44:27,298 --> 00:44:29,935
I'm gonna strangle the next
person who says that, too.

178
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:32,838
Huh!

179
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,242
Some people ...!

180
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:20,531
Join us, Liam. Join
your friends.

181
00:58:20,565 --> 00:58:22,733
Come see how dark it is ...

182
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:27,538
Who was that?

183
00:58:28,673 --> 00:58:30,808
Betty?

184
00:58:32,076 --> 00:58:40,250
Lisa? I swear to God, you
sorority babes are nuts ...!

185
00:58:40,284 --> 00:58:43,754
Pre-game jitters.

186
00:58:44,955 --> 00:58:48,192
You're just hearing some chick's
voice in your head.

187
00:58:48,225 --> 00:58:51,862
Maintain, buddy ...Maintain..

188
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:33,137
What's with the negativity?

189
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:35,339
Did you see Cliff?

190
00:59:35,372 --> 00:59:37,842
I just got up. I was on my
way to the shower.

191
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:40,344
So ... no? Did you see Gordon?
Brad? Liam? Kelso?

192
00:59:40,377 --> 00:59:43,681
I haven't seen anybody.

193
00:59:43,714 --> 00:59:45,983
They're hiding from me!
I know it!

194
00:59:46,016 --> 00:59:48,653
You mind telling me what's
going on?

195
00:59:48,686 --> 00:59:51,055
First, I get stuck writing this
frat essay. Now, I find out this

196
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:53,257
place was built over some burnt-
out old insane asylum.

197
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:55,826
What?!?

198
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:57,862
Yeah, have you ever hear of the
sanitorium that used to stand

199
00:59:57,895 --> 01:00:00,064
around here?

200
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:02,399
That place is an
old wives' tale.

201
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,935
No, that place really existed.
Here. It burnt to the ground

202
01:00:04,969 --> 01:00:07,137
twenty-five years ago today.
Then, some rich dude builds

203
01:00:07,171 --> 01:00:09,974
this place on the same lot. He
moves out a month later.

204
01:00:10,007 --> 01:00:12,677
Ten years ago today.

205
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:14,845
Nah, man, it's a horror story.
It was haunted or something.

206
01:00:14,879 --> 01:00:17,081
C'mon, Davis, haunted?

207
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:20,284
Yeah, I think they said some
patient was accidentally left

208
01:00:20,317 --> 01:00:23,087
in a padded room when
the fire broke out.

209
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,890
Whatever it is, there's no way I
can gloss over the facts here

210
01:00:25,923 --> 01:00:29,093
and make it sound good.
And it has to sound good.

211
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:31,195
I thought you were
the brains of this...

212
01:00:31,228 --> 01:00:33,831
Don't.

213
01:00:33,864 --> 01:00:36,266
You want help,
I'll help. We'll figure out a

214
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,335
to spin the whole loony bin
angle. I'm a Journalism major,

215
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:40,337
so it's no big deal.

216
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:43,007
Finally!

217
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,676
But first I have to hop in the
shower first.

218
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:48,245
No. People have been doing
this to me all day.

219
01:00:48,278 --> 01:00:50,347
You'll go off, take a shower,
then, you'll disappear into the

220
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,750
magical world of the cafeteria
or the gym or wherever the hell

221
01:00:52,783 --> 01:00:55,352
everybody else went ...

222
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:57,855
It'll take me five minutes.

223
01:00:57,888 --> 01:01:00,157
No.

224
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:02,259
You can wait outside the damn
door.

225
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:04,962
Okay. Take your shower.

226
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:07,264
You're really gonna wait
outside the door?

227
01:01:07,297 --> 01:01:09,767
You have no idea how bad I've
been dogged today.

228
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,836
You want a magazine
or something?

229
01:01:11,869 --> 01:01:13,771
I'm timing you.

230
01:08:54,664 --> 01:08:57,267
What hell's going on
in there, Davis ...?

231
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:32,336
Still having a nervous
breakdown about that essay?

232
01:09:33,637 --> 01:09:36,640
Something is very,
very wrong ...

233
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:39,309
What?

234
01:09:39,343 --> 01:09:41,578
The guys ... something happened
... something bad ...

235
01:09:41,611 --> 01:09:44,214
they're not normal ...

236
01:09:44,248 --> 01:09:46,716
Define "not normal" ...

237
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:50,587
Uh ... blank stares, the sudden
need to kill ...

238
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:53,990
Yeah, very funny.

239
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:56,760
I'm serious.

240
01:09:56,793 --> 01:09:59,596
Here's what happens. I'm going
out that door. I'm going to go

241
01:09:59,629 --> 01:10:02,599
out into the hallway. And as
soon as I see any of my frat

242
01:10:02,632 --> 01:10:04,901
brothers looking like rejects
from "Night Of The Living Dead"

243
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:07,337
-- and I won't -- I'm coming
back in here, I'm kicking your

244
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:09,373
butt and then, I'm gonna fix it
so you don't have to stress out

245
01:10:09,406 --> 01:10:11,608
about that essay one more
minute. Know why? Because

246
01:10:11,641 --> 01:10:13,977
im going to have you kicked out
of this fraternity faster than

247
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:16,580
can say "campus housing".

248
01:10:16,613 --> 01:10:18,715
Listen. Today is the
twenty-fifth anniversary

249
01:10:18,748 --> 01:10:21,351
of that sanitorium
burning down. Let's say,

250
01:10:21,385 --> 01:10:23,720
for the sake of argument,
they forget to evacuate

251
01:10:23,753 --> 01:10:26,523
one of the patients.
Some girl, some Jane

252
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:28,992
Doe, she's locked in
a padded room, she's

253
01:10:29,025 --> 01:10:31,761
burned alive. So, each
year on this date, she

254
01:10:31,795 --> 01:10:34,364
comes back and
haunts the grounds.

255
01:10:34,398 --> 01:10:36,566
Only now, it's a frat
house.

256
01:10:37,801 --> 01:10:40,537
And this is the first time
anybody reported it because ...?

257
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:44,341
The dude who built this place
moved out. Ten years ago

258
01:10:44,374 --> 01:10:48,478
today. Who knows what he
saw? Then, it's a frat house.

259
01:10:48,512 --> 01:10:51,348
And this is the first year
anyone's been here during

260
01:10:51,381 --> 01:10:54,384
Spring Break, because of that
game getting postponed ...

261
01:10:54,418 --> 01:10:56,686
I don't believe you.

262
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,323
Until five minutes ago, I didn't
believe it. But you didn't see

263
01:10:59,356 --> 01:11:02,726
those guys. Something bad
happened to them, and I think

264
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:05,729
it has something to do
with that patient ...

265
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:08,665
Like I said, when I come
back, you're out.

266
01:11:11,034 --> 01:11:13,837
Andrew?

267
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:20,810
Andrew?

268
01:11:21,411 --> 01:11:23,580
Andrew?
