00:00:17,212 --> 00:00:20,842
Hello and welcome to the morning edition
of Locksmith Harry's "Pandora's Box", 

2
00:00:21,592 --> 00:00:24,743
streaming to you live-live-live
on all your favorite devices.

3
00:00:25,423 --> 00:00:28,483
Today we're talking about hackers,
hackivists, and all things' hackerdom. 

4
00:00:28,993 --> 00:00:31,553
Modern-day Robin Hoods,
or cyber-terrorists?

5
00:00:32,472 --> 00:00:35,403
Our first guests, a dynamic
trio of professional hackers 

6
00:00:35,622 --> 00:00:39,272
known simply as BES to their
exclusive clientele and peers, 

7
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,612
they help to make our
cyberworld go 'round.

8
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:42,521
Welcome to the show.

9
00:00:42,941 --> 00:00:43,643
Thank you Harry.

10
00:00:43,983 --> 00:00:45,765
Yeah, thanks mate,
it's great to be here.

11
00:00:46,016 --> 00:00:47,517
So, where's number three?

12
00:00:47,777 --> 00:00:50,321
Uh, Stat should be
here any minute now.

13
00:00:50,542 --> 00:00:54,403
She's not too good with time, I'm afraid,
but she's excellent at what she does.

14
00:00:54,623 --> 00:00:57,477
And what you all do is,
essentially, get paid to hack.

15
00:00:57,727 --> 00:01:00,931
Uh, we're programmers... 'hacker'
could mean a lot of things.

16
00:01:01,043 --> 00:01:03,647
Yeah, and technically it's
not bad to 'hack' something.  

17
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:06,597
It's origins come from fixing
something, you know, making it better. 

18
00:01:06,597 --> 00:01:08,970
To create abstractions
that are improvements.

19
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,943
I've read about all these kinds
of color-codes for hackers. 

20
00:01:12,943 --> 00:01:17,807
you got black hats, white hats,
grey hats, blue hats...

21
00:01:17,807 --> 00:01:19,187
Which hat do you guys where?

22
00:01:19,187 --> 00:01:20,527
We're mostly white hats.

23
00:01:20,527 --> 00:01:22,651
With a few other
colors mixed in.

24
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:27,073
Ah, so you hack bank accounts and
wreak general havoc in your off-time.

25
00:01:27,073 --> 00:01:28,673
Not exactly.

26
00:01:28,673 --> 00:01:31,395
Well Harry, have you checked
your accounts lately?

27
00:01:31,395 --> 00:01:33,207
Right... right.

28
00:01:33,207 --> 00:01:37,203
No seriously, our work is to assist in
protecting your privacy and information 

29
00:01:37,203 --> 00:01:41,099
and to determine points of weakness
within a given construct or system.

30
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:42,791
oh, so you're the good guys.

31
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,273
You could say that.

32
00:01:45,112 --> 00:01:49,966
With so much of our lives online and so much of our
daily infrastructure running on a network of some kind,

33
00:01:49,906 --> 00:01:54,010
You can argue that the most powerful people
in the world are a bunch of nameless,

34
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,584
faceless folks who are the arbiters
of this age in connectivity.

35
00:01:56,584 --> 00:02:01,252
it's like a hacker-ruling class, and you
guys are making geo-political impact. 

36
00:02:01,252 --> 00:02:03,232
it must be exciting
to realize that.

37
00:02:03,232 --> 00:02:05,484
I try not to think
about it that way.

38
00:02:05,484 --> 00:02:09,148
There are certainly issues that
are being addressed because of it.

39
00:02:09,148 --> 00:02:13,142
But is it addressed properly? for
folks like me, it can be terrifying.

40
00:02:13,142 --> 00:02:17,444
I mean, i don't want private or confidential
information being laundered to the world.

41
00:02:17,444 --> 00:02:21,112
I don't want my personal accounts
compromised, my identity taken.

42
00:02:21,112 --> 00:02:23,782
Most hackers aren't
interested in those things.

43
00:02:23,782 --> 00:02:27,238
But it does happen. You guys
work security mostly.

44
00:02:27,238 --> 00:02:30,422
How do you think this affects
things, say, on a national level, 

45
00:02:30,422 --> 00:02:33,434
with stuff being taken and
weeded out to the global public?

46
00:02:33,434 --> 00:02:38,862
yeah, but the hacker ethos has a passion for
the truth. It wants what's real to be out there. 

47
00:02:38,862 --> 00:02:43,126
there are clear injustices and flaws in
our world that can be peacefully addressed, 

48
00:02:43,126 --> 00:02:46,570
and if hackers can help expose
or fix them, i say why not?

49
00:02:47,121 --> 00:02:48,823
Eva, what's your
take on this?

50
00:02:48,823 --> 00:02:53,127
I believe there shouldn't be censorship,
whether online or in real life. 

51
00:02:53,127 --> 00:02:57,700
but, i'm not a hackivist, I'm a working girl.
I love what I do, but i stay out of politics.

52
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,895
But what if the life you wish to
live is a lie, as so many proclaim. 

53
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:05,319
What if censorship in all things
becomes prevalent and the norm? 

54
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,371
Would you stand up and
fight against that?

55
00:03:07,371 --> 00:03:10,183
Well, hell yeah. But it
isn't to that point yet...

56
00:03:10,183 --> 00:03:11,965
And what about number three?

57
00:03:11,965 --> 00:03:18,011
who, Stat? As long as her iPhone is working and
she's connected somewhere, she's a happy camper.

58
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:18,991
And yourself?

59
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:22,773
Well, I believe we take a lot of
what we have today for granted. 

60
00:03:23,222 --> 00:03:28,883
We expect food to be cheap and available
everywhere; have unlimited drinking water,

61
00:03:28,863 --> 00:03:33,435
electricity at our fingertips, our cars to
run, our highways to be in good condition, 

62
00:03:33,374 --> 00:03:39,569
our Internet to function fast and without a hitch.
What happens if all that just stops working?

63
00:03:39,831 --> 00:03:42,928
well, I wouldn't be
broadcasting this show...

64
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:46,960
aye, you'd be out looking for food
and water and trying to make a fire.

65
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,458
woah nelly, let's hope it doesn't come
to that folks, because i would suck at it.

66
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:57,263
Most people probably would, Harry.
Most people probably would...

67
00:05:44,028 --> 00:05:44,930
Is that blood?

68
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,642
Hello... Earth to Jesse.

69
00:05:50,412 --> 00:05:51,872
Is that fucking
blood on your hands?

70
00:05:52,512 --> 00:05:53,432
It's not my blood.

71
00:05:53,932 --> 00:05:55,696
I guess the other guy
is all beat-up to shit -

72
00:05:55,696 --> 00:05:57,738
That's what you're gonna say?

73
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,022
Who said it was a guy?

74
00:06:01,044 --> 00:06:03,326
You're so full of shit.

75
00:06:03,609 --> 00:06:05,804
Check out my latest post. 

76
00:06:05,804 --> 00:06:07,723
Isn't that the
coolest thing ev-er?

77
00:06:09,926 --> 00:06:10,988
What is that anyway?

78
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,732
It's a wake up call.

79
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:17,711
Oh, I hate wake-up calls...

80
00:06:19,241 --> 00:06:21,335
You'll like this one.

81
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:47,861
Ow... that hurt... 

82
00:06:49,183 --> 00:06:50,077
Stop it. Jesse.  

83
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:53,649
What the fuck?

84
00:08:34,024 --> 00:08:37,450
What the fuck, Stat... what
the hell happened to you?

85
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:38,560
Hey...

86
00:08:39,472 --> 00:08:40,902
Holy shit girl, are you okay?

87
00:08:40,902 --> 00:08:43,708
Stat is on-time?
Must be Armaggeddon.

88
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,505
Hey, where were you anyway?

89
00:08:49,157 --> 00:08:51,371
I'm... not sure
what happened.

90
00:08:51,873 --> 00:08:52,934
Do you know who
did this to you?

91
00:08:53,244 --> 00:08:53,867
No clue.

92
00:09:06,398 --> 00:09:07,659
Do you know who we are?

93
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,642
I'm Eva and this is Bren...

94
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:12,839
We work together. Do you
remember what you do?

95
00:09:13,148 --> 00:09:15,050
Logging in here was... easy. 

96
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:17,603
This place looks familiar.

97
00:09:18,395 --> 00:09:19,487
That's your flat, dear.

98
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:22,749
It's pretty fucked up...

99
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,303
Shouldn't we be calling the
police, an ambulance perhaps?

100
00:09:25,563 --> 00:09:26,785
Yeah, we need to
get you looked at.

101
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:32,215
Can either of
you explain this?

102
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:38,268
It's started...

103
00:09:39,294 --> 00:09:41,565
Can you move it a
bit to the right?

104
00:09:41,805 --> 00:09:42,981
What's started?

105
00:09:43,643 --> 00:09:44,775
Actually, the other way...

106
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,271
What is it?

107
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:52,707
It's fucking glued to
my hand, you guys... 

108
00:09:52,707 --> 00:09:53,817
What the Hell is going on?

109
00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:55,017
I'm coming to you. now.

110
00:09:55,017 --> 00:09:56,471
You're taking a flight?

111
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:59,003
I'm at a friend's, so
i'm like an hour away.

112
00:09:59,003 --> 00:10:00,413
You hold tight, sister.

113
00:10:01,013 --> 00:10:03,245
Is this the friend with benefits
or the friend with problems?

114
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:04,520
None of your
fucking business.

115
00:10:04,989 --> 00:10:06,579
What the fuck is it?

116
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:08,559
It's a bit
complicated to explain.

117
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,109
Give me the Twitter version.

118
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,934
Won't fit in 140 characters,

119
00:10:12,934 --> 00:10:14,865
Darlin'. it needs
a pdf manual.

120
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:15,673
Do you remember how to code?

121
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:18,997
Wouldn't that be ironic
if she couldn't...

122
00:10:19,277 --> 00:10:20,549
This isn't fucking funny.

123
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:24,277
Irony and funny may
have moments of inclusion, 

124
00:10:24,277 --> 00:10:26,259
but they aren't
exactly synonymous.

125
00:10:28,354 --> 00:10:29,993
I don't know who i am.

126
00:10:32,116 --> 00:10:32,728
Grim.

127
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,142
Stay calm. Stay put. I'll
be there in an hour, max.  

128
00:10:37,843 --> 00:10:39,874
Bren, can you do anything
about it from remote?

129
00:10:39,874 --> 00:10:41,088
I can do almost anything from

130
00:10:41,088 --> 00:10:42,507
remote given the
time, but... that?

131
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:44,269
He put it on a
bloody phone and

132
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,750
glued it to her bloody hand.

133
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,562
WHO did?

134
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,532
We'll get to that...

135
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:50,636
Eva, you reckon it's
safe if she hangs about?

136
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:53,539
Do you remember anything?

137
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,026
bits... my head's killing me.

138
00:11:00,857 --> 00:11:01,446
Do you know your name?

139
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,490
Stat... Stacey.

140
00:11:06,861 --> 00:11:10,167
Stacey. Yeah, you
hate that name.

141
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,385
You were always Stat to us. 

142
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,193
I don't think, considering
the circumstances,

143
00:11:14,564 --> 00:11:16,256
There is a better option
for her to go to, alone.

144
00:11:16,657 --> 00:11:17,127
Hm.

145
00:11:17,498 --> 00:11:19,701
Besides, i doubt
he'll be back.

146
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:21,210
It's obviously
happening already.

147
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:22,023
Who?

148
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,653
How would you describe him?

149
00:11:24,252 --> 00:11:25,626
How about a fucking name?

150
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,356
Jesse. His name is Jesse.
Ring any bells?

151
00:11:30,826 --> 00:11:31,556
I think I...

152
00:11:41,905 --> 00:11:43,866
Well, he certainly has
that effect  on people.

153
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:01,646
Jesse...

154
00:12:04,328 --> 00:12:04,668
Pardon me? 

155
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,542
It’s the name you mentioned.

156
00:12:10,384 --> 00:12:14,066
Right. Do you know this...
Jesse?

157
00:12:15,808 --> 00:12:16,652
I know of him.

158
00:12:18,448 --> 00:12:19,270
How well do you know him?

159
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:23,034
I never met him, but he's a bit
of a rock star in certain circles. 

160
00:12:24,396 --> 00:12:25,276
I know some of his work.

161
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,978
And you think
this is his doing?

162
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,294
Security for WestDat?
Seriously?

163
00:12:38,946 --> 00:12:41,850
Why you waste your talent and time
with those people is beyond me.

164
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:43,812
They're off your map,
what do you care?

165
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,522
They pay well. 

166
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:53,404
I can see the attraction.

167
00:12:59,838 --> 00:13:03,232
Do you know that coffee is harvested
with two different kinds of bean? 

168
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:07,086
You have the ripe red bean,
which is less acidic; 

169
00:13:07,506 --> 00:13:10,676
and the unripened green bean,
which is used in lesser brands.

170
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,354
The best way to harvest coffee
to this day is to do it by hand. 

171
00:13:18,274 --> 00:13:21,000
For selection. It's
very labor intensive.

172
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,192
And the point is?

173
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,920
To have coffee abundant on every
street corner in the world,

174
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,500
you have a massive chain of industry
with the plebs of labor at the bottom. 

175
00:13:32,162 --> 00:13:34,214
How much of what we pay here
do you think goes to them?

176
00:13:35,436 --> 00:13:40,704
don't you see the pattern? the
weight between demand and sharing?

177
00:13:41,768 --> 00:13:43,341
It's like a cheap DDoS. 

178
00:13:45,764 --> 00:13:50,278
All it can lead to is
implosion and collapse.

179
00:13:56,464 --> 00:13:57,716
Ever study the fall of Rome?

180
00:13:58,448 --> 00:14:01,771
What's up. you didn't call me here
to talk about history or coffee...

181
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:03,782
We're recruiting.

182
00:14:04,265 --> 00:14:04,974
Not interested.

183
00:14:05,927 --> 00:14:12,174
Still trying to create change? To make
cyberspace a more safer, civil place?

184
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:16,610
Are you still trying to free information from the
shackles of the material by fucking it all up?

185
00:14:17,062 --> 00:14:20,334
Open your eyes. Look where you
stand. You might be surprised.

186
00:14:20,334 --> 00:14:22,196
And you obviously
know where you stand.

187
00:14:23,318 --> 00:14:24,950
You've always been a
cheerleader for transparency, 

188
00:14:26,262 --> 00:14:27,696
But you never think
about the cost.

189
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,472
The world doesn't need
transparency or change.

190
00:14:32,222 --> 00:14:35,426
It's broken, and all you keep doing
is moving the same shit around. 

191
00:14:38,696 --> 00:14:39,896
You could be writing history.

192
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,732
What ever happened to the idea that
you don't own your abstractions?

193
00:14:45,604 --> 00:14:47,166
Who ever said anything
about ownership?

194
00:14:47,376 --> 00:14:48,726
You stamp it on
everything you do.

195
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:49,700
You misunderstand me.

196
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,644
I doubt that.

197
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:52,406
How's that working for you?

198
00:14:52,406 --> 00:14:53,798
How's what working for me?

199
00:14:53,798 --> 00:14:54,890
Being cock-sure.

200
00:14:55,172 --> 00:14:56,402
Great, you?

201
00:14:57,921 --> 00:14:59,734
You can't tell me you don't
see the rot in all this. 

202
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,631
No one would
knowingly choose this. 

203
00:15:05,986 --> 00:15:08,371
The world needs
a hard reboot.

204
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:14,049
d'you practice this shit
in front of the mirror? 

205
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:17,781
Every line that comes out of
your mouth is like your code. 

206
00:15:18,593 --> 00:15:19,853
It's a lead into
a sucker punch.

207
00:15:21,905 --> 00:15:22,995
That is why you fail.

208
00:15:23,365 --> 00:15:27,593
Because i think you're like a bad
'come to jesus' bumper sticker?

209
00:15:28,201 --> 00:15:29,774
That you see humor
in any of this. 

210
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:31,560
Look in the mirror.

211
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:35,331
You're no better than those fat lemmings
sipping on their mocha frappacinos,

212
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:37,345
clogging the net with
their mundane drivel, 

213
00:15:38,073 --> 00:15:39,697
oblivious to their
enslaved existence,

214
00:15:40,787 --> 00:15:43,649
believing that people actually give a
fuck about what they're doing at any

215
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:45,421
given moment as they happily
hand over their lives.

216
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:48,451
and you're like a
bad post in Phrack.

217
00:15:50,773 --> 00:15:53,037
Since when do you give a shit about
what people do with their lives?

218
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:01,215
Payback is imminent.
Lines will be drawn.

219
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,945
you'll want to be on
the right side when it does.

220
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:07,594
I'll keep that in mind.

221
00:16:55,856 --> 00:16:57,658
Call the police, now!

222
00:17:01,366 --> 00:17:02,116
You okay?

223
00:17:04,016 --> 00:17:07,432
I’m very sorry to say this,
but after you talk to the police,

224
00:17:08,032 --> 00:17:09,872
I don’t want you
back here again.

225
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,406
This is a serious
allegation you’re making

226
00:17:24,528 --> 00:17:29,282
I made no allegation. I just asked who did
your last security work. It's all there.

227
00:17:30,764 --> 00:17:32,524
We'll have our it people
look into this immediately.

228
00:17:33,304 --> 00:17:33,905
You do that.

229
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,795
Say, I got some time after
this. Wanna get a drink?

230
00:17:42,842 --> 00:17:44,116
I'll send the
invoice to accounts.

231
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,992
Getting a lead into this stream
is proving a bit difficult. 

232
00:18:03,184 --> 00:18:06,630
You're in the best position to do so,
i'm afraid. or eva, whenever she gets there.

233
00:18:08,392 --> 00:18:10,166
I need to get this
thing off my hand...

234
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,478
You have to
appreciate the irony.

235
00:18:15,722 --> 00:18:17,124
What if I just turn it off?

236
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:21,946
Yeah, look... though the actual event resides
somewhere else, let's hold that thought, alright?

237
00:18:37,624 --> 00:18:39,432
Today, you're about to
be a part of history.

238
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:52,026
Today, you're not going to tweet, post, or
say anything mundane or ridiculously trivial. 

239
00:18:51,118 --> 00:18:55,076
Today, the  world
is going to wake up

240
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:02,318
and hear your words.

241
00:19:11,722 --> 00:19:14,466
Well, not your words. 

242
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,222
But you'll be my herald.

243
00:19:22,354 --> 00:19:24,737
Today's the day that
you get your wish: 

244
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:28,999
to be famous, 

245
00:19:31,386 --> 00:19:32,696
and remembered.

246
00:20:12,573 --> 00:20:15,146
I remember bits
about this guy Jesse.

247
00:20:15,724 --> 00:20:16,735
My condolences.

248
00:20:17,285 --> 00:20:18,888
He's psycho.

249
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,651
He's definitely a character.

250
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:24,366
Are you on the
fanboy forums?

251
00:20:25,346 --> 00:20:28,201
Hardly. An odd fascination
more than anything. 

252
00:20:28,442 --> 00:20:30,763
He knows his shit,
no one can argue that. 

253
00:20:31,576 --> 00:20:34,056
His great grandfather
was part of the Choctaw

254
00:20:34,056 --> 00:20:37,002
code talkers in your Army's 36th
Infantry Division, World War One.

255
00:20:38,054 --> 00:20:42,288
He's relentless, a nutter, and definitely
two sandwiches short of a picnic;

256
00:20:43,178 --> 00:20:46,343
but he's been a voice for a
lot of angry people for years.

257
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:50,060
You and Eva never got along
with him. I keep my distance.

258
00:20:50,401 --> 00:20:51,952
Eva seemed like she
knew what this was.

259
00:20:52,244 --> 00:20:55,540
Let's just say Eva has had more
dealings with Jesse than either of us; 

260
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,454
a rather unenviable position.

261
00:21:06,272 --> 00:21:08,483
I wouldn't do anything with
that phone if I were you...

262
00:21:09,406 --> 00:21:10,566
someone just text'd me.

263
00:21:11,298 --> 00:21:12,340
yeah well, don't reply.

264
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,192
Too late.

265
00:21:15,552 --> 00:21:16,302
Are you daft?

266
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:17,863
What if it's him?

267
00:21:18,764 --> 00:21:21,169
Then you've just let him
know that's you're lucid,

268
00:21:20,574 --> 00:21:21,196
That you're okay.

269
00:21:21,606 --> 00:21:22,758
I think he wants me to be.

270
00:21:23,068 --> 00:21:25,190
After beating you within
a sliver of your life?

271
00:21:27,014 --> 00:21:28,806
First, we don't
know who did this.

272
00:21:29,376 --> 00:21:32,432
I know it was Jesse who busted my
nose, but that was another time.

273
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:42,689
Oh fuck...

274
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:43,472
What?

275
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:45,925
Shit.

276
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,186
We just lost four hours.

277
00:21:52,887 --> 00:21:53,559
How?

278
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,281
He's fucking with me.

279
00:21:55,823 --> 00:21:58,395
Eva thinks it's Jesse from something
she's glimpsed in the stream.

280
00:21:58,787 --> 00:22:00,097
Could it be anyone else?

281
00:22:03,091 --> 00:22:06,026
I don't know... I mean,
this can't all be for me. 

282
00:22:06,695 --> 00:22:11,019
This part, the phone, is for me,
but what's happening on the phone...

283
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:14,813
Well, he knows you code, otherwise why
put it there? it's like he's showing off...

284
00:22:15,403 --> 00:22:16,085
It's like a dare.

285
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:18,730
It certainly fits Jesse's M.O.

286
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:22,762
You really should
get to a hospital.

287
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,310
I'll live.

288
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,112
People have died from less. 

289
00:22:26,605 --> 00:22:30,235
You could have a concussion, internal
bleeding, brain hemorrhaging-

290
00:22:30,235 --> 00:22:30,785
Bren...

291
00:22:30,785 --> 00:22:31,808
- or any of the above.

292
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:37,301
I'll get to a hospital once we figure this
out and get this fucking phone off my hand.

293
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:39,891
Yeah, well maybe a hospital would
get the phone off your hand.

294
00:22:40,281 --> 00:22:41,701
Focus, Bren.

295
00:22:42,452 --> 00:22:44,152
I thought it was rather
a bright idea myself. 

296
00:22:47,755 --> 00:22:48,624
d'you got any acetone?

297
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:52,841
I don't remember if i
have acetone in the house; 

298
00:22:53,312 --> 00:22:55,707
and even if I do, how am I
supposed to find it in this mess?

299
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:58,313
How about margarine?

300
00:22:58,313 --> 00:22:59,734
Says here margarine works.

301
00:23:00,534 --> 00:23:04,949
Or... you could use soap and water
to soften it against your skin,

302
00:23:06,123 --> 00:23:08,053
though water and phones
usually don't mix very well.

303
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:13,697
Stat continues to look
around her desk for something.

304
00:23:41,647 --> 00:23:43,038
Well, at least you
haven't lost that.

305
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:44,832
Apparently. 

306
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,386
It crossed my mind, but you don't think
this is some kind of a bomb do you?

307
00:23:49,978 --> 00:23:51,520
What, you mean the
kind that goes boom?

308
00:23:51,941 --> 00:23:52,956
Is there another kind?

309
00:23:55,148 --> 00:23:56,110
Yeah, the kind that goes boom.

310
00:23:57,192 --> 00:24:01,006
Look, anything's possible,
but Jesse resides in another place.

311
00:24:01,308 --> 00:24:02,818
He's ambitious
beyond measure.

312
00:24:03,681 --> 00:24:05,582
Bombs, they're dirty...
not elegant.

313
00:24:06,562 --> 00:24:10,586
If you ask me, he's playing
something on a much grander scale.

314
00:24:56,574 --> 00:24:59,166
It's a long string. i'll let
you know if i've hit the loop yet.

315
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:10,938
Get out of the fucking way!

316
00:25:12,748 --> 00:25:14,528
Are you kidding me?? what?

317
00:25:58,109 --> 00:25:59,889
Eva just called,
said she's almost there.

318
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,790
Great. 

319
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:06,628
Figures he'd glue the
fucking phone to my right hand.

320
00:26:08,078 --> 00:26:10,269
I got the source links,
but it's to hell and back.

321
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:12,511
Okay, just give me a sec...

322
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,411
How's the head?

323
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,610
Numb. Cold. 

324
00:26:20,891 --> 00:26:22,010
I just remembered something...

325
00:26:22,741 --> 00:26:23,200
Oh?

326
00:26:23,741 --> 00:26:24,441
I have a gun.

327
00:26:25,303 --> 00:26:26,055
The point is?

328
00:26:26,842 --> 00:26:28,076
It's getting down
to the wire.

329
00:26:28,428 --> 00:26:29,978
Who knows what's going
to happen at zero.

330
00:26:31,032 --> 00:26:35,053
Look, if it's locked away somewhere,
why not just leave it there? 

331
00:26:35,755 --> 00:26:37,784
Typical.
Bloody cowboys, all of ya.

332
00:26:38,244 --> 00:26:40,194
Look, the gun isn't going
to solve this problem.

333
00:26:40,194 --> 00:26:42,223
I don't think when
the clock gets to zero,

334
00:26:42,223 --> 00:26:45,046
a zombie is going to pop
out of your closet at ya.

335
00:26:52,146 --> 00:26:54,435
Besides, you said you're
right-handed, right?

336
00:26:54,735 --> 00:26:57,165
It's not much use trying to
fire a weapon in your off-hand.

337
00:26:57,586 --> 00:26:58,995
Jesus, you sound
like my mother.

338
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:03,395
I'm ambidextrous with a few
things and, it still shoots.

339
00:27:04,048 --> 00:27:05,027
Not funny.

340
00:28:19,253 --> 00:28:28,680
What if I stick this line with a false go-to,
hook it, plant the variable here, and...

341
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,234
Ha. Brilliant. Could work.

342
00:28:31,014 --> 00:28:31,924
Could set it off again...

343
00:28:31,924 --> 00:28:33,964
Yeah, well...
it could do that.

344
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:38,444
You think Eva will
be here in less than... 

345
00:28:38,444 --> 00:28:39,546
Twenty minutes?

346
00:28:39,796 --> 00:28:41,856
Not sure. Let me call her.

347
00:28:47,036 --> 00:28:49,356
Hello.
Yeah, how far are you? 

348
00:28:49,356 --> 00:28:51,346
We may have a break
on the strings.

349
00:28:55,926 --> 00:28:57,346
Well, it's a bit
tighter than that.

350
00:29:03,228 --> 00:29:05,068
Stat will explain
when you get there.

351
00:29:07,018 --> 00:29:11,230
She said that she's ten minutes
away, and not to do anything rash.

352
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,590
Rash?

353
00:29:12,864 --> 00:29:13,951
I'm paraphrasing.

354
00:29:15,334 --> 00:29:16,214
Gonna do it.

355
00:29:17,196 --> 00:29:19,206
If you give me a bit more time,

356
00:29:19,206 --> 00:29:21,188
I could figure out
what is at stake here.

357
00:29:21,188 --> 00:29:23,178
Time is not exactly on our side.

358
00:29:24,588 --> 00:29:25,628
Just give me ten minutes.

359
00:29:25,948 --> 00:29:29,200
Stopping the sequence is priority
right now, whatever's at stake.

360
00:29:33,462 --> 00:29:34,692
I'll take that as agreement.

361
00:29:53,087 --> 00:29:54,187
Fuck me...

362
00:30:08,853 --> 00:30:09,693
What, it worked?

363
00:30:11,195 --> 00:30:11,805
It worked.

364
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:15,255
That calls for a drink.

365
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:16,925
I need a smoke.

366
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,135
You don't smoke.

367
00:30:20,115 --> 00:30:20,716
Nice try.

368
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,735
Listen, shouldn't
you just stay put?

369
00:30:24,045 --> 00:30:25,156
I need some fresh air.

370
00:30:25,906 --> 00:30:27,857
Okay, that doesn't
make any sense.

371
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:30,847
I'll just be out
around the corner.

372
00:30:33,147 --> 00:30:37,276
Cheers. i'll let eva in when she
gets here, tell her you're outside.

373
00:30:37,807 --> 00:30:38,337
Breathing.

374
00:30:39,036 --> 00:30:40,277
Tell her there's
beer in the fridge.

375
00:30:40,957 --> 00:30:43,457
Oh so she gets a beer for
driving over, and I get nothing?

376
00:30:43,847 --> 00:30:47,687
How about a night of rounds at that watering
hole under the tracks you like so much?

377
00:30:51,377 --> 00:30:52,017
You're back.

378
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,678
How's the nose?

379
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,160
Sorry for the mess, 

380
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:34,360
the boys had it  in their minds that
you had something on the operation. 

381
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,380
you had some really neat stuff.

382
00:32:19,347 --> 00:32:23,948
Fix it now, bitch.
Fix it!

383
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:37,481
It's clever. but all you're doing
is delaying the inevitable.

384
00:32:40,874 --> 00:32:42,896
Glad to inconvenience you.

385
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,219
He's a spineless shit. 

386
00:32:45,219 --> 00:32:46,410
Couldn't  even do it himself.

387
00:32:47,947 --> 00:32:48,527
Enough.

388
00:33:09,474 --> 00:33:09,924
Stat...

389
00:33:18,274 --> 00:33:21,423
Stop, or she dies. 

390
00:33:23,124 --> 00:33:25,073
Not another step.

391
00:33:36,773 --> 00:33:38,073
How long were you in on this, Bren?

392
00:33:40,473 --> 00:33:45,093
As long as it made sense.
When did you figure it out?

393
00:33:45,093 --> 00:33:46,213
What the fuck?

394
00:33:46,623 --> 00:33:48,543
Hard to ignore your
comments in the code.

395
00:33:48,863 --> 00:33:50,183
You wanted me to know.

396
00:33:50,643 --> 00:33:52,083
Okay, everyone just chill. 

397
00:33:52,343 --> 00:33:54,323
All of this drama
isn't necessary.

398
00:33:54,613 --> 00:33:56,933
And Jesse, for god's sake,
put the bloody gun down!

399
00:34:00,523 --> 00:34:04,207
Stat. You will see the virtue
in all this once it's done.

400
00:34:04,517 --> 00:34:07,867
And the World will realize
everything they took for granted.

401
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:15,107
From the ashes of discontent and
enslavement, true freedom shall rise.

402
00:34:18,817 --> 00:34:20,197
Jesse, have you gone mental?

403
00:34:21,437 --> 00:34:23,107
Get with the bloody program.

404
00:34:24,089 --> 00:34:25,259
Put the gun down, now.

405
00:34:36,798 --> 00:34:37,918
Your ass is next.

406
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:43,648
I never keep it loaded...

407
00:34:46,049 --> 00:34:48,955
... thank god you're okay.

408
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,260
You can't stop it. 

409
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,250
It all ends and begins. 

410
00:35:02,984 --> 00:35:04,314
now.
