00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,347
[Laughs]
Yeah, I like that.

180
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:01,550
I've been to 14 interviews
since I graduated.

181
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:03,469
No one wants to sponsor
foreigners anymore.

182
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,856
Who cares if your visa's
not good? Just stay.

183
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,724
Millions of people
do it every year.

184
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,059
No.

185
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,978
I won't stay
if I'm not wanted.

186
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,870
[Winces]

187
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,457
[Dials]

188
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,461
Yeah, give me
Immigration.

189
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,085
[Whistling]

190
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,230
Howard!

191
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,765
[Resumes whistling]

192
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,651
Get here
a little faster, buddy.

193
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,153
Come on. Grab that one, too.

194
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,521
[Claps hands]

195
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,940
I've never been so
humiliated in my life,

196
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,408
not even in Moscow,

197
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,910
where you expect men
to act like pigs.

198
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,412
Well, Elena,
you have legal options.

199
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,864
You don't have to let him
get away with this.

200
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,282
He's only a symptom.

201
00:11:06,782 --> 00:11:07,783
I just don't
have status.

202
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:08,701
That's the problem.

203
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,619
You're smart and ambitious.

204
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,921
You will find a sponsor.

205
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,673
In three weeks?
I know people who've been

206
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,508
looking for anything
that pays for months.

207
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,343
Way to be supportive,
darlin'.

208
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,345
I'm just
being honest with her.

209
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,932
Ha ha! I made this
specially for you.

210
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:27,853
Seared monkfish in a wild
mushroom broth. Enjoy it.

211
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,188
Smells so good.

212
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,975
Mmm. This is
better than sex.

213
00:11:33,142 --> 00:11:34,560
Well, maybe you
shouldn't have any.

214
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,696
[Giggles]

215
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,030
Mmm.
Enjoy.

216
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,315
This is great, man,
five star.

217
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,483
Thanks, man.

218
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,785
You are
a true artist, Carlos.

219
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,654
It is what I was born
to do, to give pleasure.

220
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,623
Enjoy it, okay?
Thank you.

221
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,158
I'll see you guys
at closing.

222
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:52,328
You didn't tell him,
did you?

223
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:53,713
No, only that
I didn't get the job.

224
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,214
You know Carlos.

225
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,215
He'll do
something stupid

226
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,083
and get himself
deported.

227
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,801
I never realized
how careful

228
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,553
immigrants have to be
all the time.

229
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,473
All I ever wanted was
to come to America

230
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,342
and have a better life.

231
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:07,226
We'll figure this out.

232
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,728
You are our best friends,

233
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,229
and you're
not going anywhere.

234
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,597
Oh, my God.
Congratulations!

235
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:14,100
[Claps hands]
Yeah. Ha ha ha ha!

236
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,601
MIKE: What's going on?

237
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,103
They just got engaged.

238
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,188
Oh, how sweet. Hi.

239
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,275
Don't forget my tip.
I mean it.

240
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:24,577
I know how cheap you are.

241
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,915
ELENA:
I'm worried about them.

242
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,417
CARLOS: They haven't been
getting along for a while.

243
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,868
Yeah, but it's
getting worse now.

244
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,338
I'm lucky I found you.

245
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,344
If I go back to Russia,
would you come with me?

246
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,381
Freeze! Nobody move!

247
00:12:45,714 --> 00:12:46,298
Wh-What?
On the ground!

248
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,683
Let's go! Get on the ground!

249
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,101
Elena Dubrovnik.
Yes.

250
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,803
You're under arrest, sweetheart.
You're coming with me.

251
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,104
We haven't done anything!

252
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:52,972
Let her go!

253
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:53,856
We received information

254
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:55,274
that your immigration
status has expired.

255
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,358
That's a lie. Who gave
you this information?

256
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:57,693
That's privileged.

257
00:12:57,893 --> 00:12:58,477
Hey, get your hands
off her, man!

258
00:12:58,978 --> 00:12:59,695
Did he also tell you
he tried to molest me?

259
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,030
Molest you?
Who tried to molest you?

260
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,031
Shut the fuck up!
[Blow strikes]

261
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,402
[Door slams shut]

262
00:13:07,903 --> 00:13:09,405
[Door opens]

263
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:23,752
What'd they
pop you for, honey?

264
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,589
They think I'm illegal.

265
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,675
An accent like that,

266
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:30,559
you don't exactly
sound American.

267
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,344
I'm Russian.

268
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:36,098
Oh, you one of those,
uh, mail-order brides?

269
00:13:36,432 --> 00:13:38,984
No. I'm a student.

270
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:42,321
Ah, well, let me guess.
Cosmetology, huh?

271
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:43,989
International finance.

272
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,359
Hmm. Well, good luck
with that, sister.

273
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,861
Hey, let me know
when they're hiring

274
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,362
so I don't have to work
on my back.

275
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:51,864
[Keys jingle]

276
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,666
[Buzzer]

277
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,423
You know, your visa
expires in 20 days,

278
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,425
so if I were you, I'd make
some travel arrangements.

279
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,426
Otherwise,
you're gonna be coming

280
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,377
back here
for an extended stay.

281
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,557
Where is Carlos?

282
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:19,808
In the car.

283
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,894
This place makes him
a little jumpy.

284
00:14:25,981 --> 00:14:28,567
The agent said they'd received
reliable information

285
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,069
that my status had expired.

286
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,070
CARLOS:
That is bullshit!

287
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,071
Can't we sue the police,

288
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,039
hire a lawyer
or something?

289
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,541
No podemos pagar,
mi amor.

290
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,542
MIKE:
What'd she say?

291
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,244
No money for lawyers.

292
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,580
Well, maybe
I could do it.

293
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:42,998
I'm almost a lawyer.

294
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,301
Oh, boy.

295
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:53,842
[sighs]

296
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,231
There are basically
two ways

297
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,016
to immigrate
into the U.S.,

298
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,352
through an employer
or a family member.

299
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:04,353
We don't have either one.

300
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:05,854
I know.

301
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:07,239
So your only hope is
winning the visa lottery.

302
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,574
What is that?

303
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:09,775
It's a lottery
for green cards.

304
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,110
And what are her chances?

305
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,578
About the same as
winning the Powerball.

306
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,946
Uh, well...

307
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,115
The only way you could
legally stay in the U.S.

308
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,866
is for you to find
a U.S. citizen to marry.

309
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,368
The same for you,
Carlos.

310
00:15:19,368 --> 00:15:20,869
Well, it's not a bad idea.

311
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:21,670
It's a pretty good idea.

312
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,505
What?

313
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,007
Come on.
That wouldn't be so hard

314
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,425
to find somebody
to marry you.

315
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:28,594
We could pay somebody,
yeah? I mean...

316
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:29,845
They don't have any money,
and neither do we.

317
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,047
We could chip in.

318
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,382
We don't need any money.
I mean, who--

319
00:15:33,382 --> 00:15:34,183
They would marry her for free.

320
00:15:34,383 --> 00:15:36,352
And I would marry
a rich white guy too.

321
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:37,720
Are you crazy?

322
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,637
Yes.

323
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,522
That's illegal. You
have to marry a woman.

324
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,057
Fine. I'll marry
a rich white girl.

325
00:15:42,057 --> 00:15:42,942
Does it matter?

326
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:44,143
I'm handsome.
[Laughs]

327
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,028
What's so funny?
I'm serious.

328
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,813
No, that might
actually work.

329
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,114
I mean, if you're
game, I'm game.

330
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:50,532
I mean, why not?
I'm game.

331
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:52,484
Hang on. Wait. Wait.
This is way over my head.

332
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,954
Let's find a real lawyer.

333
00:15:55,404 --> 00:15:57,489
BETTY: You want to what?

334
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,326
MIKE: Betty, you said
you wanted to help 'em out.

335
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:04,163
Yeah, help,
donate time to the cause,

336
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,382
give free legal advice,
but not you.

337
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,383
This is something
I want to do,

338
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,834
and I know
it's gonna be tough,

339
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:12,471
but, look, maybe this
is something we need.

340
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,390
This is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

341
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,808
We do not need this.

342
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:20,346
Our lives are perfectly fine
just the way they are.

343
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,897
This is Elena, and,
you know, in this case,

344
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,732
it really is
just a piece of paper.

345
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:25,017
They're
our best friends.

346
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,352
I know.

347
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,070
Well, then, let's do it.

348
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,857
What's the worst
that could happen?

349
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,610
So how long do we
have to stay married?

350
00:16:34,943 --> 00:16:37,946
Two years. It's a long time,
and it's serious.

351
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,916
I have to state again
that Congress has devoted

352
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,919
an entire act to the penalties
for engaging in marriage fraud.

353
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,922
I could be disbarred before
I even finish law school.

354
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,425
She's right. This isn't

00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,951
Mike, Mike, you just
have to push forward

534
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,953
with this thing.
Play it out all the way.

535
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,454
Yeah,
all the way to jail.

536
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,455
I just want to
pretend none of this

537
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:41,957
ever happened.
I want a divorce.

538
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,959
You and Elena are married.

539
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,460
It's a legally
binding document.

540
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,963
You can't abandon her.

541
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,966
That's it.
We'll swap. Simple.

542
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,468
Swap?

543
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:54,970
Swap what?

544
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:55,971
Each other.

545
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,473
Um, I'll move in
with Elena,

546
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,475
and Carlos will
move in with you.

547
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,979
Oh, God, no. [Laughs]

548
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,480
I am not gonna live
with Carlos.

549
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,481
You wanted to go
all the way.

550
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:07,482
No!
Well, baby,
this is all the way.

551
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,483
I don't know
what else to do.

552
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,985
I told the woman
I was living on a boat.

553
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:10,852
Oh, uh-uh. I don't--

554
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,737
Ohh! I don't know.

555
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,239
Carlos in my apartment?

556
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,740
Our apartment.

557
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,743
Using my bathroom, going
through my personal things.

558
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,078
He's not neat.

559
00:26:21,363 --> 00:26:22,664
There's got to be another way.

560
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,418
Prison.

561
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,336
That's the better way.

562
00:26:28,703 --> 00:26:30,755
真El barco m?o?
That's crazy, man.

563
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,173
I forbid it.
It will never work.

564
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:32,958
It has to.

565
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,259
The agent has to
come and see

566
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,844
that we're a happy,
loving, married couple

567
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,345
living together
under one roof,

568
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,713
or in this case,
your goddamn boat.

569
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:40,966
She saw us doing it.

570
00:26:43,218 --> 00:26:44,302
She was in your bedroom?

571
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:46,137
No, we were
in the living room.

572
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:47,439
Nice work,amigo.
Where?

573
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,556
On the floor?
Against a wall?

574
00:26:48,556 --> 00:26:49,307
On the couch.

575
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,109
That's totally
off topic. I--Focus.

576
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,560
Okay, okay.

577
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:54,896
Let's say we do this.
Where do I live?

578
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:56,615
With me.

579
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:00,986
Really?
I can live with that.

580
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:05,824
JOEY HOLLAND:
?? Another honeymoon ??

581
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:09,794
?
?? And not a moment too soon ?

582
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,830
?? Just what we needed ??

583
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,499
?? Another honeymoon ??

584
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:15,967
[Glass shatters]

585
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,421
?? Uh-huh ??

586
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,391
?? Ooh doo doo doo ??

587
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,187
?? Tears on my pillow... ??

588
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:39,691
No problem. It was just
my CD and my stereo.

589
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,693
It's no problem.

590
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:44,195
Don't worry about it.

591
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:46,197
?? Another day ??

592
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:47,198
?? Another dime... ??

593
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:48,033
[Mouths word]

594
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,336
I hate these shorts.

595
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,837
Don't let him wear them.

596
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,205
I'm just gonna
throw 'em out.

597
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:55,957
Whoop.

598
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:56,841
Okay...
I'll get this.

599
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,210
I guess this
is all of it.

600
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,465
Well...

601
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,267
Well, this is awkward.

602
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,135
Yeah. [Laughs]

603
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,520
Yeah, it's a
little strange.

604
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,555
Uh, I guess me
and the missis

605
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:11,690
will go back
to thecasa.

606
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,692
Okay.
Okay.

607
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,527
I'll call you later,
sweetie.

608
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,645
Te veo, Orita.
Bye.

609
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,030
Bye.

610
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,949
MIKE: Don't do anything
I wouldn't do, you know.

611
00:28:21,316 --> 00:28:21,900
I don't know.
You know what I mean.

612
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,036
Just keep your paws
off the merchandise.

613
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,371
Right back at you, bro.

614
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:27,956
Ah.
Hey, hey, Mike,

615
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,624
I can say
the same thing to you.

616
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,409
You don't have to.

617
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,246
Ciao.
Ciao.

620
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,052
So, shall
I bring my stuff

621
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,555
into your bedroom,
Betty Boo?

622
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,556
[Laughs] Carlos.
Yeah?

623
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,974
Stop.
What?

624
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,658
Okay.

625
00:29:12,534 --> 00:29:14,119
It's a beautiful night.

626
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,954
I'm gonna go
sleep up on deck.

627
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,173
Sleep on top
of the sheets with me.

628
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,758
I don't think
that's a good idea.

629
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,509
What if the agent
comes back?

630
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,297
You're right.

631
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,718
Mike, thank you
for being my fake husband.

632
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,893
Hi.

633
00:29:40,395 --> 00:29:41,646
Hi.

634
00:29:41,896 --> 00:29:44,115
I just put some clean
towels out for you.

635
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:44,983
Gracias.

636
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,069
Are you gonna
be okay out here?

637
00:29:48,236 --> 00:29:51,823
I think I'd be a little
more comfortable in your bed.

638
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,826
[Both laugh]

639
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:56,828
Good night, Carlos.

640
00:30:00,748 --> 00:30:02,217
What kind
of Latin lover am I?

641
00:30:02,584 --> 00:30:05,170
[Scoffs] The couch.

642
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,172
Shit.

643
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:45,126
Did you sleep well?

644
00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:47,929
Yeah. It must have
been the water.

645
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,931
The gentle rocking,
it's nice, huh?

646
00:30:50,298 --> 00:30:52,717
Yeah, it's like a--
It's like a big water bed.

647
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,802
I'm coming up.

648
00:31:06,814 --> 00:31:07,899
Oh, sweet Jesus!

649
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,200
I didn't see anything.

650
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,402
I don't mind if you look.
Hand me that towel.

651
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,328
Does that make you
feel uncomfortable?

652
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,296
No.

653
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:22,297
Yes.

654
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,082
I don't know.

655
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,217
You can look now.

656
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,972
I'll never understand
you Europeans

657
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:34,392
and your utter freedom
with your body.

658
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,477
Everyone has one, no?

659
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,481
Do you always swim naked
in the morning?

660
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,267
The fish don't
seem to mind.

661
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:44,435
Do you?

662
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,273
I don't mind
if they don't mind.

663
00:31:56,531 --> 00:31:58,032

Aah!

00:32:13,047 --> 00:32:13,965
Get out!
Jesus.

667
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,934
God, at least knock.

668
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,777
Oh, my God.

669
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,278
Oh, my God. Help.

670
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,279
Help!

671
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,816
Elena, help!

672
00:32:32,066 --> 00:32:33,117
What?

673
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,152
I can't--
The water's off.

674
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:35,653
I can't see anything.
I got soap in my eyes.

675
00:32:36,237 --> 00:32:37,655
Oh, hold on.

676
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,543
Here.

677
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:43,544
Thank you.

[Laughs]

680
00:32:51,085 --> 00:32:51,886
Did you see anything?

681
00:32:52,086 --> 00:32:54,973
Um, maybe, a little.

682
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,725
It's--It's cold.

Hello. Hey.
Hey.

686
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,178
Where's Elena?

687
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,014
She's at a job interview.
Did you forget something?

688
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,383
No, man. I just came by
to see how you're doing.

689
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:41,769
Uh, we're good. You?

690
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,104
Yeah, man,
I'm cool.

691
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,605
Man, you got
a nice crib.

692
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,391
Thanks. Thank you.
How's Betty?

693
00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:47,225
It's cool.

694
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:48,226
Yeah, Elena's good too.

695
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:50,194
Oh, good. [Laughs]

696
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,146
Man, we got a couple of
cool girlfriends, huh?

697
00:33:52,146 --> 00:33:53,231
I mean,
not a lot of girls

698
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,699
would go for
this living situation.

699
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,567
So how'd you sleep,
buddy?

700
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,903
Good. Good. You?

701
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:00,288
Oh, I miss Elena

702
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,656
and sleeping in my bed
and all that.

703
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,374
Me too. [Laughs]

704
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:04,575
Sleeping with Elena?

705
00:34:04,992 --> 00:34:07,578
No, uh, Betty.
What--What did you think?

706
00:34:07,995 --> 00:34:09,080
[Both laugh]

707
00:34:09,497 --> 00:34:10,581
It's just--Heh heh.

[Both laughing]

709
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:17,088
No, really,
where did you sleep?

710
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:19,474
I was gonna sleep up there,
but she wouldn't let me.

711
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,475
Oh, that's nice of her.

712
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,426
So then where?

713
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:24,429
I slept down here
on top of the...

714
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,851
on top of the floor.

715
00:34:30,184 --> 00:34:31,185
You mean on the floor?

716
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,154
On the floor, yeah.

717

[Both chuckle]

718
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:40,111
Yeah. Well,
I got to go to work.

719
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,029
Can you tell Elena
I came by to say hello?

720
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,282
Okay. Ple--
Tell Betty hi too, please.

721
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,950
Cool. Uh...

722
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,618
did she go swimming
this morning?

723
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:49,454
Who? Di...

724
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:50,455
Elena.

725
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:51,956
Sorry. Uh, I don't know.

726
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:52,840
I was--I was sleeping, so...

727
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,209
Tell her not to, okay?

728
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,179
Don't--Are you afraid
she might drown?

729
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,047
[Both laugh]

730
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:01,382
Just tell her not to.

731
00:35:01,883 --> 00:35:03,634
Carlos says no swimming.

732
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:05,019
Thank you.
Okay.Nada.

733
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:06,888
Give me a hug.
Okay.

734
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:16,564
BETTY: Oh, my God!

735
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:23,654
Ohh!

736
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:24,655
What?

[Cell phone

740
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,395
Hi, baby. Miss me?

741
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,263
You've got a problem.

742
00:35:49,597 --> 00:35:51,182
We promised my parents
we'd be there for Thanksgiving,

743
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,017
so we'll never hear the end
of it if we bail on them.

744
00:35:53,267 --> 00:35:55,269
Just take Elena
with you.

745
00:35:55,603 --> 00:35:57,188
As my wife?

746
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,241
She is your wife for
the next 23 months.

747
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,193
All right, if I'm going,
you're going with me.

748
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,195
Okay, fine. I'll go.

749
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:06,280
Don't have to be
such a baby about it.

750
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,200
As Carlos' fianc?e.

751
00:36:09,617 --> 00:36:11,702
I like that idea.

752
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:15,006
Guys, this sounds
very complicated.

753
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,924
My mom's gonna be so pissed.

754
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,211
She loves Betty.

755
00:36:20,461 --> 00:36:21,045
He's so uptight.

756
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:22,430
How do you live
with this guy?

757
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,098
Mama's boy.

we should have

taken the highway
and not surface streets.

leaving town.

so uptight, Mike.

762
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:32,640
I'm just saying.

the first time, Mike.

Now, remember,
we can't blow this.

We convince them,

767
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,481
we can convince
the INS agent from hell.

over it a hundred times.

Well, I can see why you made
such a rash decision, son.

south, Colombia.

where the drugs come from.

you here again, dear.

Oh, and you.

You must really
be something

to steal my son's heart
so quickly.

00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,675
You know,
we didn't even have time

796
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,093
to put an announcement
in the paper.

797
00:37:42,376 --> 00:37:43,427
You didn't knock her up,
did you, son?

Jesus, Dad.

with your relationships.

It's okay. I'm good.

but I got it.

I'll take it.

not even offering.

carrying my bag.

Why did you dump Betty?

I--
She must be heartbroken.

841
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,267
Does she look
heartbroken?

842
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:17,104
I'm just saying, honey,
it was all so sudden,

843
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,606
and Betty's such
a nice young lady,

844
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:20,941
and Carlos is so, so--

845
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,977
Latin?
Yes, exactly.

846
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:25,980
Look, Mom, uh, just
because Betty's nice

847
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,947
doesn't mean
that I should spend

848
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:27,732
the rest of my life
with her.

849
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,533
But a Russian?

850
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,318
I mean, they used
to be our enemy.

851
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:34,622
I--Mom, Elena's smart,
and she speaks her mind,

852
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,541
and she doesn't schedule
every waking moment.

853
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:38,959
What's wrong with scheduling?

854
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,829
I mean, if I didn't, our lives
would be absolute chaos.

855
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,164
Okay, Mom.

856
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,134
Unh! It's just all so odd.

857
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,920
All right, everyone,
why don't we all settle in?

858
00:39:50,171 --> 00:39:52,089
Uh, Betty, you and Mike,

859
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,391
you take Mike's old room
just like always.

860
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,175
Wait. Mom.

861
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,426
Oh, I'm sorry.

862
00:39:55,843 --> 00:39:58,262
Uh, I'm just so used
to Betty being here.

863
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:01,599
Uh, So, Betty, you'll
be in Sarah's room,

864
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,568
and, um, Carlos, you'll
be in the guesthouse,

865
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:05,820
and Mike and Elena--

866
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:06,821
Are married.

867
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,159
Right.

868
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,664
You have any Pepto-Bismol?

869
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,581
Yes.

870
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:20,785
I'm surprised
by how casual you are.

871
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:22,753
I mean, four years together.

872
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,789
I couldn't be
so cool about it.

873
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:26,290
Well, we just decided
that there is

874
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,293
no reason why
we can't stay friends.

875
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:31,796
Oh, I suppose
that Latin love machine

876
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:34,799
takes some of the sting
out of it. [Laughs]

877
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,018
[Betty laughs]

878
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,607
Betty, you can
be honest with me.

879
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,892
Is she using him?

880
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,145
For what?

881
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:50,564
To stay in this country.

882
00:40:50,564 --> 00:40:52,700
I'm guessing
she isn't a citizen.

883
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,237
Uh, they just fell in love,
Jill, really.

884
00:40:56,237 --> 00:40:58,122
Well, what do
you know about her?

885
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,958
Did she just appear
out of thin air?

886
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:04,245
He has never
mentioned her, not once,

887
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,963
and I only learned about it
because I got a letter.

888
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,883
Actually, she's my, um--
She's my best friend.

889
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,385
She's your best friend,
and you're fine

890
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:13,003
that she's with
your old boyfriend?

891
00:41:13,587 --> 00:41:14,588
Yeah, well--[Laughs]

892
00:41:14,588 --> 00:41:17,341
I know that this--
It seems awkward,

893
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:19,677
but they're just
really happy together,

894
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:22,146
and I know that Mike wants you
to be happy for them as well.

895
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,399
Well, I'll try.

896
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:30,187
Oh, it's just so good
to have you here, dear.

897
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:33,908
Mmm.
Just all very strange.

898
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,662
[slow exhalation]

899
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,082
This is going
pretty well, huh?

900
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,001
What?

901
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,920
I just feel bad
for Betty.

902
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,422
Why?
[Sighs]

903
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,424
Well, your parents
obviously love her.

904
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:53,928
She should be the one
sleeping here, not me.

905
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,429
I feel like a fake in
front of your parents.

906
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,433
Look, it's--it's just
gonna be one night.

907
00:42:03,804 --> 00:42:04,772
Whoa.
Dad.

908
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,441
I am so sorry, kids.

909
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,393
I forgot.
You have to knock

910
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:10,444
with newlyweds
in the house.

911
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,446
Dad, it's okay.
We were just...

912
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:13,731
Talking.

913
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:14,481
Talking.

914
00:42:14,982 --> 00:42:16,534
Yeah, I can see it
on your face.

915
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,869
You can't fool me,
sweetheart.

916
00:42:20,321 --> 00:42:22,706
Yeah, you've got that look.

917
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,043
[Laughs] Talking?

918
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,962
You're a lucky guy, son.

919
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:29,914
Well, come on.
Pull yourself away

920
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:31,916
from this beautiful
Russian bride of yours.

921
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:33,584
We'll hit some balls
before dinner.

922
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,386
Hey, where's Carlos?

923
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:36,887
Does he play?

924
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,673
Hey, Carlos! Carlos!

925
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,759
What does he mean,
hit balls?

926
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:45,479
[Knock on door]

927
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,733
Betty, this is crazy.

928
00:42:50,017 --> 00:42:50,601
Mike's mother
doesn't believe in us,

929
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,102
and his father
is just a little nuts!

930
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:54,405
He grows on you,
kind of like Mike.

931
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,523
I don't want anyone
to grow on me.

932
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,828
Elena, the INS is
already suspicious.

933
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,696
They've contacted
his parents.

934
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,582
This is our insurance.

935
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,451
I know. It's a mess.

936
00:43:07,701 --> 00:43:09,787
We just have to get through it
the best way we can.

937
00:43:13,874 --> 00:43:15,292
We'll be right back, hon.

938
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,094
Dinner will be
ready at 5:00.

939
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,596
Yeah, I know. I know.

940
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,547
We're just gonna play
the front nine, okay?

941
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,433
Well, does Carlos
play golf?

942
00:43:22,716 --> 00:43:23,717
Well, I didn't
think I did.

943
00:43:24,051 --> 00:43:25,135
Do you drinkcerveza?

944
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:26,637
I do that
very well, sir.

945
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:28,138
Do you smoke cigars?

946
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:29,139
[Scoffs] Of course.
I'm Colombian.

947
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,641
Then you can play golf, son.

948
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:31,558
Nice.
[Laughs]

949
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:33,060
Hey, you're early.
Look at you.

950
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,062
Happy Thanksgiving.

951
00:43:35,062 --> 00:43:35,896
Hola.

952
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:37,231
Hola.

953
00:43:37,231 --> 00:43:39,149
Your mother will explain.
Let's go, men.

954
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,151
Hey. Yeah. Hi.

955
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,654
You're early.

956
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:45,656
Hey.

957
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,157
Ah, look who's here.

958
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:49,159
Hi, sweetie.

959
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:50,077
Here. Give me that.

960
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:56,083
Okay.
So where's the wife?

961
00:44:03,424 --> 00:44:03,924
All right,hombre.

962
00:44:04,425 --> 00:44:05,392
Left arm straight,
straight.

963
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,312
Okay, so hand like
this, finger here,

964
00:44:08,595 --> 00:44:09,980
like--like you're
holding a gun.

965
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,732
Oh, that's easy. Yeah.

966
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,184
And, uh,
up and back.

967
00:44:14,601 --> 00:44:15,686
Jesus Christ.

968
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:17,187
Make it--
Make it two boxes.

969
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:18,188
All right.

970
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:25,162
Okay, I'm ready.

971
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:29,333
Hey, batter, batter,
batter, batter!

972
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,835
Batter! Heh.

973
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,337
Sorry, sir.

974
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,927
Oh, not bad, son.
Not bad at all.

975
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:43,347
Okay, Carlos,
head down, eye on the ball.

976
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:45,799
Hey, I didn't mean
to barge in

977
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,551
on the hot and heavy
with Elena, Mike.

978
00:44:47,801 --> 00:44:49,853
You know, I never really
mentioned it before,

979
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,222
but, uh, I don't
really care for Betty.

980
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:55,059
No offense, Carlos.
Eye on the ball.

981
00:44:55,309 --> 00:44:56,310
I mean, she's just
kind of stuck-up

982
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:57,478
for my taste.
She's not stuck-up.

983
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:58,729
She's a little
stuck-up, Mike.

984
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,698
Oh, but this
Russian chick,

985
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,649
she is hot as hell.

986
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,618
I walked in on 'em.

987
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:05,369
Another couple
of minutes,

988
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:07,071
it would have been
high heels to the sky.

989
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:08,372
I never touched her.
Nothing happened, man,

990
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:09,957
only in his perverted mind.

991
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,825
No need to defend
yourself, pal.

992
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,577
You're married.

993
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:14,712
Don't listen to him.

994
00:45:14,995 --> 00:45:16,580
If you touch her, Mike,
I will kill you.

995
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:17,581
It's our way.

996
00:45:24,004 --> 00:45:25,005
Whoa!

997
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,307
You're a natural,
amigo.

998
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,394
Hey, I don't
know how you

999
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,395
play the game
where you come from,

1000
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,346
but here
in this country,

1001
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,815
we pick up the club,
we walk to the ball.

1002
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,900
We do not throw
the club.

1003
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,988
[Overlapping conversations]

1004
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:43,824
All right, everybody,

1005
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:45,159
dessert plates to the sink.

1006
00:45:45,526 --> 00:45:46,410
I'll do it, Mom.

1007
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,245
Oh, good man. This will
give you practice

1008
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,830
for your
food service career

1009
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,166
when you finally
get your degree.

1010
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,501
What's that supposed
to mean?

1011
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,336
Oh, I don't know.

1012
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:57,788
What was your, uh--
your college major?

1013
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:02,209
I-I'm getting a PhD.

1014
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,177
HAROLD: A PhD.

1015
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:04,962
I'm studying English literature,

1016
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,430
specifically the sonnet.

1017
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,431
The sonnet.
Yes.

1018
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:08,882
What are you gonna do
with these sonnets?

1019
00:46:08,882 --> 00:46:10,717
You gonna stand on
a corner and sell them?

1020
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:13,771
What Mike is studying is the
sonnets as a literature genre.

1021
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,273
It goes back
to the 14th century,

1022
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:19,143
Italian poet Petrarch,
and not until the 16th century--

1023
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,945
Sweetheart, that is
all very fascinating,

1024
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,697
but it seems to me
if you're gonna put

1025
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,816
all that time
and all that money

1026
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,734
into a degree, you ought
to get something

1027
00:46:27,734 --> 00:46:29,736
that's gonna put food
on the table.

1028
00:46:29,736 --> 00:46:30,737
JILL: Enough, Harold.

1029
00:46:30,737 --> 00:46:34,074
We have been through this
a thousand times.

1030
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:36,827
Yeah, I know. I'm just
yanking his chain.

1031
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:40,414
The study of poetry is a very
valuable task, Mr. White.

1032
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:44,218
Part of the original text of
the Bible was written as poetry,

1033
00:46:44,418 --> 00:46:48,505
so it has many purposes besides
bringing beauty to the world.

1034
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:49,506
Hmm.

1035
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:51,842
I assure you,
we'll be just fine.

1036
00:46:52,092 --> 00:46:54,478
You do what you love.

1037
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:58,515
You also have to work hard
at what you love.

1038
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:02,853
I just don't
understand, Betty.

1039
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:05,072
You and Mike, you were
made for each other.

1040
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,106
Obviously,
we weren't, Mom.

1041
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,575
Otherwise, I wouldn't
be married to Elena.

1042
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:09,526
What are you gonna
serve your children

1043
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,913
on Thanksgiving, Elena?
Borscht? Vodka?

1044
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,164
Jesus, Mom!

1045
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:15,866
If it's not one of you,
it's the other.

1046
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,786
We don't celebrate Thanksgiving
in Russia, Mrs. White.

1047
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:20,671
Well, of course not.

1048
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,673
What do you have
to be thankful for?

1049
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,959
Chernobyl?
Losing the space race?

1050
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,344
I mean, you sent a monkey.

1051
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:28,345
Shh, shh, shh.

1052
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,764
What do you and my son
have in common?

1053
00:47:31,131 --> 00:47:33,717
We are very much
in love.

1054
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,607
She hates me.

1055
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,810
No, she hates me for
blowing it with her son.

1056
00:47:44,144 --> 00:47:45,729
Okay, let's calm down.

1057
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:48,732
She's your mother,
and you hurt her.

1058
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:50,234
Poor Elena has to put up
with this for two years.

1059
00:47:50,651 --> 00:47:51,735
We'll make it
through this.

1060
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:53,287
If we can make it through
this horrible night,

1061
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,655
we can make it
through anything.

1062
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:58,575
Oh, did I
interrupt something?

1063
00:47:58,575 --> 00:47:59,626
No. Actually,
Carlos and I

1064
00:47:59,993 --> 00:48:01,378
were going to bed.

1065
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:05,999
Good night.

1066
00:48:08,001 --> 00:48:10,137
Keep it down tonight, son.

1067
00:48:10,504 --> 00:48:15,842
Oh, and, uh, try not to break
the bedsprings, you lucky dog.

1068
00:48:16,176 --> 00:48:17,261
[Laughs]

1069
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:18,679
[Laughs]

1070
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,182
Good night, Dad.

1071
00:48:22,182 --> 00:48:23,517
I thought you were
sleeping with Sarah.

1072
00:48:26,019 --> 00:48:28,605
No. Your mother
insisted as a couple

1073
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:29,856
we stay together.

1074
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:32,276
We are engaged.

1075
00:48:32,526 --> 00:48:33,944
That's right.

1076
00:48:51,044 --> 00:48:53,130
CARLOS: Putting it
in the back. Oh, hold on.

1077
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:54,631
Ah, almost.

1078
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:56,633
Oh, I got my hand on there.

1079
00:48:57,050 --> 00:49:00,604
[Groaning] I--I--I got...

1080
00:49:04,057 --> 00:49:05,892
Oh, it's so tight.

1081
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,645
[Groans]

1082
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:10,397
Oh, God. Ahh.

1083
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,531
What are you doing?

1084
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:12,866
I'm trying to watch
thef?tbolgame

1085
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,702
once I get
this cable connected.

1086
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:17,988
It's after midnight.
Football isn't on.

1087
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,540
I'm talking about
realf?tbol,okay?

1088
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,292
Colombia versus Argentina.

1089
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:23,961
[Laughs] Oh.

1090
00:49:24,244 --> 00:49:26,163
What's the matter? You okay?

1091
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:26,997
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just--

1092
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:29,416
I--I needed to get
some air. Oh.

1093
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:30,751
Yeah.

1094
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,552
Remind me never
to do this again.

1095
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:33,637
You mean to tell me

1096
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,588
we're not coming
for Christmas?

1097
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:36,506
[Laughs]

1098
00:49:38,425 --> 00:49:39,893
Hey, listen. I'm really
worried about Elena, man.

1099
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,813
Seriously, I mean,
this is really hard on her.

1100
00:49:43,096 --> 00:49:44,181
I mean, we have
your mother against us,

1101
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:45,682
the United States
government.

1102
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:46,600
It's very difficult,

1103
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,068
and I'm sure it's hard
on you too.

1104
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:49,403
I'm okay.

1105
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,238
Right.

1106
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:54,024
Look, I wanted
to talk to you

1107
00:49:54,274 --> 00:49:55,359
about something, man.

1108
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,244
Yeah?

1109
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,912
I just wanted
to say thank you,

1110
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:01,698
and words can't express
how I feel about you

1111
00:50:01,698 --> 00:50:03,000
and what you've done.

1112
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,336
No problem. [Laughs]

1113
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:07,838
What'd you think
I was gonna say?

1114
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,091
I thought, eh--

1115
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:14,594
I thought you thought that
Elena and I were going at it.

1116
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,596
[Laughs]

1117
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:19,099
I know what your dad
said and everything,

1118
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:22,135
but I know for sure,
for sure that Elena

1119
00:50:22,135 --> 00:50:24,938
doesn't find you the
least bit attractive.

1120
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:27,391
I mean, you're
a good-looking guy

1121
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:28,358
and everything, but...

1122
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,979
In the dark.

1123
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:42,406
Hi.

1124
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:49,246
You read my dissertation.

1125
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,549
Are you mad?

1126
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:53,333
Uh, no.

1127
00:50:55,669 --> 00:50:58,055
Uh, just the opposite.

1128
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,424
The sonnets are
very beautiful, Mike.

1129
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:04,094
Even if your parents
don't understand,

1130
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:07,347
you shouldn't be ashamed
of what you love.

1131
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:19,993
BETTY: What a nightmare.

1132
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,245
Bye.
Bye.

1133
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:23,413
Bye.
Thank you.

1134
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,198
Keep it up, son.
[Laughs]

1135
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,117
Bye.
Bye.

1136
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:30,537
Something very strange
is going on here.

1137
00:51:30,537 --> 00:51:33,423
It's called love,
Mother. It happens.

1138
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,092
If he's so in love with her,

1139
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,594
then why isn't he riding in
the back seat with his wife?

1140
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,096
Ah, who gives a shit?

1141
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,097
Let it go, Mom.

1142
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,598
Just be happy
he's happy.

1143
00:51:55,896 --> 00:51:57,481
Have you worked
on a boat before?

1144
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,316
Nope. Unh!

1145
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:02,986

without water before either.

Can you please
give me that?

I've already
checked it out.

I guess Mike is
going first to open.

1177
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:00,403
Yes. You spent so much time
laying around the apartment,

1178
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,322
that I thought you'd be
more comfortable in a robe.

1179

It's nice.

00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:09,362
Thank you, honey.

1182
00:54:09,362 --> 00:54:10,247
This is really
thoughtful.

1183
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:11,915
Matches your eyes.

Uh, you're next.

1185

Carlos goes first.

Just what
you always wanted.

No, it's a--
No, I really like it.

1190
00:54:31,384 --> 00:54:33,270
I just--I just got
to buy a suit now.

1191
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,941
I thought it's time
to embrace change.

1192
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:39,225
Gracias, mi amor.

1193
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:42,696
You're next.

It's a gift certificate,

1195
00:54:49,569 --> 00:54:50,453
I thought that you--

1196
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,205
You're always
so disappointed

1197
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,206
with the stuff
that you get. This time,

1198
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:54,074
you can buy yourself
something,

1199
00:54:54,407 --> 00:54:55,992
and that way, you
wouldn't be disappointed

1200
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:57,827
like you normally are.

1201
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:02,666
I don't know what--

1202
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:05,001
I don't know what to say.

this is for you.

1204
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:14,844
Wow, Carlos.

1205
00:55:15,095 --> 00:55:17,647
These are beautiful.
Betty, look.

1206
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:18,648
Those are amazing.

Wow, look.

Ha ha ha.

1209
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:24,020
Actually, I have
something too.

1210
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,271
Um, could you...

1211
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,107
Sorry.
I thought my wife

1212
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:28,191
would want
something from, uh,

1213
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:29,943
her husband, so...

1214
00:55:30,443 --> 00:55:31,444
This is for me?

1215
00:55:31,444 --> 00:55:32,445
Yes.

1216
00:55:37,784 --> 00:55:38,785
Wow.

1217
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:42,172
Uh, the first charm

1218
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,007
is for good fortune
in America.

1219
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:46,843
The second charm
is for, uh,

1220
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:47,844
finding a job you adore,

1221
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:49,846
and the third charm,
the heart,

1222
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,131
is for luck in love.

1223
00:55:51,631 --> 00:55:53,883
Mike, this is so thoughtful.

1224
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:55,218
You're welcome.
I just--I...

1225
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,519
It's very nice.

1226
00:55:57,971 --> 00:55:58,805
Why the hell does she
need love, man?

1227
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:00,473
She has me.

1228
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:04,277
Um, anyway, uh...

1229
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:05,278
wine all around,
yes?

1230
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:06,279
Yes.
Yes?

1231
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:07,230
Okay.

1232
00:56:07,647 --> 00:56:08,732
Betty.

1233
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,472
Okay, so you were
born in Moscow.

1234
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,308
Your birthday
is September 26.

1235
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:36,810
Uh, you don't like
to drink ice water,

1236
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,812
because it makes
your teeth cold.

1237
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:42,816
You, uh--You count from 1 to 120
when you brush your teeth.

1238
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,818
When you're nervous,
you tuck a piece of hair

1239
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:46,569
behind your ear even though
it isn't out of place.

1240
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,354
I don't do that.

1241
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:49,606
Yeah, you do. It's only when
you're nervous. It's cute.

1242
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,826
Um, your favorite color
is green.

1243
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,745
Uh, you talk in your sleep
in Russian,

1244
00:56:56,029 --> 00:56:57,614
so I don't understand
what you're saying.

1245
00:56:57,997 --> 00:56:59,582
How does it sound?

1246
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:02,085
I don't know. Uh...

1247
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,586
happy, I guess.

1248
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,088
Should I go on?

1249
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,589
They're not gonna
ask all that anyway.

1250
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:08,508
We have our names
on the boat lease,

1251
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:11,010
joint credit cards
and a checking account,

1252
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:13,513
the photos
at our wedding

1253
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:14,380
and your parents' house.

1254
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,349
All they care about
is documentation.

1255
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:20,303
Should I tell them how you like
to swim naked at sunrise?

1256
00:57:22,222 --> 00:57:23,139
That's our secret.

1257
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,204
Who are these other people?

1258
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:44,210
Uh, my best friend
and his fianc?e.

1259
00:57:45,578 --> 00:57:46,963
How were the ribs?

1260
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:49,883
We didn't have any.

1261
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:52,886
Um, we wanted to get
going with the honeymoon,

1262
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,137
if you know
what I'm saying.

1263
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:55,421
[Chuckles]

1264
00:57:55,922 --> 00:57:56,723
What's Elena's
favorite soda?

1265
00:57:56,923 --> 00:57:57,474
Sorry?

1266
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:59,309
Her favorite soda?

1267
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,311
Come on.
This should be easy.

1268
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,595
You've been man and wife
for how long?

1269
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:05,899
Uh, it'll be
two months Friday.

1270
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:08,184
So what's the answer?

1271
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:09,152
This is your wife.

1272
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:10,653
She--She doesn't
have any.

1273
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,655
She only drinks,
uh, wine

1274
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:15,658
or water without ice.

1275
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:20,663
Heh.

1276
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:21,915
Correct.

1277
00:58:22,282 --> 00:58:22,832
Well, you'll receive

1278
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:24,868
your immigration papers
in four weeks.

1279
00:58:31,457 --> 00:58:33,543
Oh, my God!

1280

JOEY HOLLAND:
?? Another day goes by ??

1281
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:50,610
?? Another in your eye... ??

1282
00:58:50,977 --> 00:58:52,896
Are you saying you don't
want to have children?

1283
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,781
No. Of course that's not
what I'm saying.

1284
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,649
I just, you know...
[Scoffs]

1285
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,035
Because I want
a family,

1286
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:00,537
and it's not something
you can plan.

1287
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,321
It might just happen.

1288
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:02,956
You're not pregnant,
are you?

1289
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:05,575
Oh, my God.

1290
00:59:05,992 --> 00:59:06,960
CARLOS: No.

1291
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:08,661
Would that be so terrible?

1292
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:09,462
Yes.

1293
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,164
No, it'd be great.

1294
00:59:11,331 --> 00:59:12,165
She just started
her life here.

1295
00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:13,716
Mothers have careers
all the time,

1296
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:14,467
millions of 'em.

1297
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,052
Not when a baby is sucking

1298
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,387
all the life and money
out of you.

1299
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,173
Oh, my God, that's cold.

1300
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,091
Guys, I'm not pregnant.

1301
00:59:22,508 --> 00:59:23,593
Oh, my God.
Gracias.

1302
00:59:23,593 --> 00:59:25,762
Oh, I--I almost
shit on myself, man.

1303
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:28,231
[Laughs] Me, too.

1304
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:32,101
Carlos, it would kill you
to be a father,mi amor?

1305
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:34,988
No. I mean, you know,

1306
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,906
I can barely take care
of myself now, you know.

1307
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:39,108
Yeah, that's right.

1308
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,327
I think I'm gonna have
a baby when I'm 33.

1309
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:44,163
It's not too old,
and it's not too young.

1310
00:59:44,364 --> 00:59:44,948
I'm not sure it's
something you can

1311
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:46,449
put on a spreadsheet
and tack to

1312
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:47,951
your refrigerator,
darlin'.

1313
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,371
Sure I can.

1314
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,841
I'm sorry.
Far be it from me

1315
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:57,293
to doubt your ability
to control everything.

1316
01:00:02,048 --> 01:00:03,967
Wow. I thought
you were already 33.

1317
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,302
That's not very nice.

1318
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,689
BETTY: That, ladies
and gentlemen of the jury,

1319
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:11,474
is what happened.

1320
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,611
What'd you think
of my closing argument?

1321
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,312
It was okay.

1322
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:18,231
But you say it
like it was just--

1323
01:00:18,231 --> 01:00:20,617
you know, just fine.
[Sighs]

1324
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:21,901
That's right.
That's exactly what I said.

1325
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,039
How long do I have to wait?

1326
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:27,991
Oh. Oh, um, innocent.
Let him go.

1327
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:31,294
No, I'm the prosecution,
Carlos.

1328
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:35,131
I mean, guilty.
Lock the son of a bitch up.

[Groans]

1330
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,255
Aw. Look, I'm sorry.

1331
01:00:42,255 --> 01:00:44,757
You have to be
more convincing, you know.

1332
01:00:44,757 --> 01:00:46,592
Put more passion,
more fire into it.

1333
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:48,478
Make me believe you.

01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:53,566
700 ADL rifle for 15 years.

1335
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:57,570
He knows this rifle
very well,

1336
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:00,773
as he uses it every weekend
during hunting season.

1337
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,859
Betty,
you were fantastic!

1338
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:04,694
You were great, brilliant,
so convincing!

1339
01:01:05,111 --> 01:01:06,913
Oh, you're so sweet.
Thank you.

1340
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:07,747
Guilty!
Ohh.

1341
01:01:10,616 --> 01:01:12,669
Now we can catch up.

1342
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,537
What?

1343
01:01:14,954 --> 01:01:16,539
You know.

1344
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:18,758
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, sure.

1345
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:21,427
Um, we've actually
got to get going.

1346
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:23,429
Elena has a meeting with
an employer in the morning.

1347
01:01:28,968 --> 01:01:29,936
Te veo, Orita.

1348
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,721
Gracias, mi amor.

1349
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:33,473
Buena suerte.

1350
01:01:33,806 --> 01:01:35,391
So what's up, Betty Boo?

1351
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:37,393
Want to go dancing?

1352
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:38,895
Trip the light
fantastic?

1353
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:41,948

?? Do you like the way
I move... ??

1355
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:52,241
Oh, this was
a good idea...

1356
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:53,543
[Horn honks]
hearing those.

1357
01:01:53,826 --> 01:01:55,378
Whoo! Getting attention.

1358
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:57,830
Whoo. I love attention.

1359
01:01:59,832 --> 01:02:01,918
Is Mike really working
on his thesis tonight?

1360
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:04,170
It's not a thesis, Betty.
It's a dissertation,

1361
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:05,972
and that's what he said
he wanted to do.

1362
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:07,306
And you believed him?

1363
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:09,592
Shouldn't I?

1364
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:12,061
Elena, he has been working
on that thesis for years.

1365
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,896
He doesn't want
to finish it.

1366
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:15,765
Why not?

1367
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:17,734
Because then he'll have
to get a real job

1368
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,769
and enter
the real world.

1369
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:21,604
And he doesn't
want a real job?

1370
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:24,357
Mike doesn't really
know what he wants.

ELENA: This guy has
been staring at you.

1376
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:42,592
I thought that
he was looking at you.

1377
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:45,878
I wanted to ask you
something.

1378
01:02:46,212 --> 01:02:48,047
Yeah.

1379
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:49,932
Do you love Mike?

1380
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,719
Um, I think so.

1381
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:54,937
You're not sure?

1382
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:58,775
Yes, I do. I do.
I love him.

1383
01:02:59,058 --> 01:03:00,109
But you don't seem happy.

1384
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:02,562
Well, four years
is just a long time

1385
01:03:02,562 --> 01:03:04,480
to be with
the same person.

1386
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:07,233
Why have you stayed together
if you're not happy?

1387
01:03:08,568 --> 01:03:10,453
Because it's safe.

1388
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,706
We know
each other's boundaries,

1389
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:14,574
not to cross them.

1390
01:03:16,075 --> 01:03:19,579
It's not perfect,
but it works for us.

?? Then you want
to come back ??

1392
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:21,581
?
?? And you found another ?

01:03:21,581 --> 01:03:22,915

Hello there, Mrs. White.

1397
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:32,592
Oh, I like
the sound of that.

1398
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:34,977
It's, uh,
easier to pronounce.

working all night?

1401
01:03:39,432 --> 01:03:41,517
Yeah. If I keep having
nights like this,

1402
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:45,021

Thank you. I've been, uh...

1406
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:57,033
I don't know. I been feeling
more passionate lately.

1407
01:03:58,367 --> 01:03:59,952
Passion's good.

1408
01:04:02,955 --> 01:04:04,423
What are you doing?

1409
01:04:04,790 --> 01:04:06,375
Dancing got me
all sweaty and hot,

1410
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:07,877
so I'm gonna take a dip.

1411
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:13,933

1588
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:22,574

not upset about it.

Betty,

1591

we're supposed to be.

1592
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:34,803

have gotten married.

1593

would have happened.

want to get married.

such a stupid thing?

I was jealous, okay?
I was mad,

1601
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:17,379

and I'm sorry.

I have to leave.

No! We'll hire
an attorney.

1604
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:22,351
We'll fight this out.
I'll tell them

1605
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:24,853

of rage and jealousy.

1606

Carlos, we've done
everything possible

1607
01:15:27,139 --> 01:15:28,557

we can do.

1626
01:16:43,882 --> 01:16:44,883

caught us.

and I ruined it for me, man!

were there today?

already.

explained to you.

nothing to me.

all over her.
