1
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,480
How's my life gonna be?
I don't know.

2
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
I don't know.

3
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,200
Maybe good, maybe bad.
I don't know.

4
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,440
Lord knows.

5
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,200
<i>Cité Soleil</i>

6
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,880
<i>is a new city in Port-au-Prince.</i>

7
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
<i>A slum</i>

8
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,760
<i>built up with people</i>
<i>coming from the countryside.</i>

9
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,320
<i>Poor people</i>

10
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,600
<i>coming to Port-au-Prince</i>
<i>with the hope</i>

11
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,440
<i>to find a better living.</i>

12
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,680
<i>At the time of François Duvalier</i>

13
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,360
<i>he was going to build up</i>
<i>a city</i>

14
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,720
<i>for tourists to see</i>
<i>that there is something</i>

15
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,200
<i>beautiful in Haiti.</i>

16
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,440
<i>We've waited for so long</i>
<i>The government's full of shit</i>

17
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,240
<i>We're waiting for change</i>
<i>We need it, let me tell you</i>

18
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,000
I know who I am.

19
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,160
I know where I wanna be.

20
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,240
I know where I'm from also.

21
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,200
The life of a young man
like me

22
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,120
you have to have
your own dreams.

23
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,279
<i>Listen up</i>
<i>I'm here to tell you a story</i>

24
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,839
<i>I declare that</i>
<i>what I tell you is the truth</i>

25
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,400
<i>2pac could sing</i>
<i>His parents were full of hope</i>

26
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,960
<i>Couldn't imagine</i>
<i>he'd be destroyed like that</i>

27
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,480
<i>See what the police did</i>
<i>Cast them into darkness</i>

28
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,080
<i>His parents are in despair</i>
<i>Oh God, our Father</i>

29
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,880
<i>Look at the people of our youth</i>
<i>Carrying a cross</i>

30
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,360
<i>Day after day</i>
<i>The cross becomes too heavy</i>

31
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,480
Oh, check out the real situation.

32
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,280
That's my fucking girlfriend,
nigga baby.

33
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,720
Let me see how many it is.

34
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,200
35 bullets.

35
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,000
They may call me a gangster,
but I'm also a rapper.

36
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,280
Oh, goddamn.
Let's go, baby! Let's go!

37
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,480
I'm in Cité Soleil.
My soldiers are in Cité Soleil.

38
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,520
They know I'm pure mafia.
You don't fuck with 2pac. No!

39
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,920
I'm 2pac. I'll eat you alive
and no one know will ever know.

40
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,040
But if you attack my kid

41
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,920
I'll go after you in broad
daylight, understand? Broad daylight!

42
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,600
Don't cry, baby.

43
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,960
Dad is not going to die.

44
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,360
Got a beautiful daughter, man.
She is three years old.

45
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,360
I got to take care of her and all.

46
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,880
I don't want to die.
All we need is peace, baby.

47
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,720
Unity Makes Strong.

48
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,640
Freedom or death!
Freedom or death!

49
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,080
Aristide to prison!
Chimeres to school!

50
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,120
I used to burn tires in the street
for Aristide, you know.

51
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,280
Write his name everywhere on the
road, "Vive Aristide", you know.

52
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,480
"Down with the opposition".
That's what I do.

53
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,640
When they see we fight for Aristide.
We give Aristide power.

54
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,960
What do they do? They know
they can't fuck with Aristide.

55
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,680
Now they make us hot!

56
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,200
They give us the name "Chimeres"
and make everybody scared of us.

57
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,520
We are in the learning process
of building a state of law.

58
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,960
How could we let thugs, gangs

59
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,240
moving ahead with weapons
in their hands? No!

60
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,480
<i>We're with the big boss</i>
<i>Nobody can hurt us now</i>

61
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:51,400
<i>Nobody can hit us</i>
<i>with their bullets today</i>

62
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,840
I got the big boss
in the government.

63
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,080
So they give me this car
to work in, you see?

64
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,840
<i>Official Vehicle</i>
<i>Mayor of Port-au-Prince</i>

65
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,680
It's my pass.

66
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,320
It's like that, man.
We're cool, brother.

67
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,120
They don't wanna rent
the house no more

68
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,200
with all the Chimeres
running around with guns.

69
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,160
That's not true.
That's complete bullshit.

70
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,840
What am I gonna do
if the Chimeres make them leave?

71
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,360
Don't worry.
I'll come back later.

72
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,559
See? The big boss is here.
I take care of things.

73
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:41,679
It's for their own good.
When my guys fuck up, I fix it.

74
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,840
I want you to understand, dog.

75
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,400
That song, that music is
the real Tupac, nigga.

76
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,560
Peace.

77
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,120
Planet. You understand?
We can never have peace.

78
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,600
<i>That's why I keep my pistol</i>
<i>in the street, nigga</i>

79
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,120
I was just talking to
my little brother, Bily. Goddamn...

80
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,320
They call him <i>Iron Pants, </i>baby.

81
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,560
You know, we're two brothers.

82
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:39,120
Like y'all know. 2pac, fuck.
I'm a thugster, a gangster.

83
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,320
But Bily, not a gangster.
It's true.

84
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,920
Bily wants to be president,
you know, of Haiti.

85
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,080
Fuck Haiti, man.

86
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,520
But my brother, I respect him anyway.
I respect him.

87
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,680
<i>I used to be like 2pac</i>
<i>It wasn't me</i>

88
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,840
<i>I used to be like Che Guevara</i>
<i>It wasn't me</i>

89
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,400
Yo, Lily, just relax.
No money now.

90
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,800
I'm a poor man now.

91
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,600
You steal something, pow! You die!

92
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
Just try and do your best, alright?

93
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,640
If you are a rich man, you are
supposed to help the poor people.

94
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,960
If you see the life
of people here

95
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,880
no house to sleep in, no job,
no water, nothing to eat

96
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,560
no money to pay for school
for the children.

97
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,600
But they have a gun.
What do you think they can do?

98
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,800
People of Cité Soleil have
no one to speak for them.

99
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,280
There is only Aristide.

100
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,720
Cité Soleil might have
about 300,000 people.

101
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,880
Soleil 1, Soleil 3, Soleil 5.

102
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,200
Okay, my town is right here.
Soleil 19, baby.

103
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:08,280
Labanye, Amaral, 2pac,
Bily, Dread Wilmer.

104
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Fuck, we're five guys, man.

105
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,240
We're five guys!
We represent Cité Soleil.

106
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,480
I'm going to the car.

107
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,120
This is Bily here.

108
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,920
We're on the microphone.
We must have the power.

109
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,240
It's me the power!

110
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,400
My brother,
I really love my little brother.

111
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,200
He works for Aristide.
He's a Lavals, fuck!

112
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:07,160
I can't fight against my brother.
I have to be with him.

113
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,560
They are all dressed now.

114
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,840
Everything is in the hands of 2pac.

115
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,800
What about the guns?

116
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,960
I gave guns to three people.

117
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,440
You know I'm the chief.

118
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,720
Am not going out without a weapon.

119
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,480
They say Bily makes a lot
of trouble on the streets.

120
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,080
Yeah sure, I make lots of shit
when we hit the streets

121
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,280
but apart from that, shoot at
students from the schools? No.

122
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,280
The assassins, rebels who
are against us? Yes.

123
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,320
Is Labanye there also?

124
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,840
Yes, if he don't go,
Aristide will kill him.

125
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:00,240
You gotta be a real G.
Motherfucker! Thug for life!

126
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,120
Okay... Hello?

127
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,080
Hello? Hello, Bily.

128
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,800
What?

129
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,840
Fuck.
He had a car accident.

130
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,520
All of his guys have problems.

131
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,600
And he asked for, you know,
bandage and everything.

132
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,960
But, I don't know, I cannot...

133
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,360
Helicopter, Mr. Aristide.

134
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,640
What?

135
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:17,080
Don't be the President's soldier,
okay? At least for a few days.

136
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,960
Last night we were
at President Aristide's house

137
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,920
providing security for him.

138
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,360
We stayed till morning
and went to barricade the streets.

139
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,880
Bily was driving and falling asleep.

140
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,080
The car was going fast, really fast.

141
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,280
The car rolled around.

142
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:49,280
It rolled around once,
and the second time it stopped.

143
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,920
Franzo's wounded.
He's got bruises all over.

144
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,600
They had an accident.
I wanted to talk to Franzo.

145
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,440
2pac says I went back
to steal from him.

146
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,760
Me? How come?
Why should I do that?

147
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,200
I'm sure you took it.
Listen to me.

148
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,920
What money? Ask Franzo.
He's right here.

149
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,040
We were on a mission
and came straight home.

150
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,280
-I'm gonna kill you.
-Oh, this is bad.

151
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,440
I don't mess with people's stuff.
Get it?

152
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,440
I brought it to you.
Gave everything back.

153
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,640
I'd never go in his pockets.
I'd never steal from Franzo.

154
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,480
-I'm talking and you're interrupting!
-No, Chief.

155
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,320
Fuck you!

156
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,200
-I'm gonna kill you!
-I know nothing about it!

157
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,320
The Prime Minister has
ordered the police force

158
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,120
to crush our demonstration.

159
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,360
Let's go, baby. Let's go.

160
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,560
Peace and love.

161
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,960
Everybody's scared of Cité Soleil.
Everybody's afraid of Cité Soleil.

162
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:32,080
I know in Cité Soleil you never
live long, always die young.

163
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,080
Always die young.

164
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,880
-What's her name?
-Genaldo.

165
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,560
You see the head?

166
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,280
-There's a lot of pressure.
-Yes, it's water inside.

167
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:01,880
The doctor said if the head stays
like this, it will explode.

168
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,760
Listen, I'll call the lady
I told you about.

169
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:13,880
Hello... I would like to...

170
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,400
Hello?

171
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,040
Aristide let me stay in prison.
Do two years.

172
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,160
And for no reason.
He knew I didn't do nothing.

173
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,120
And Aristide's like a motherfucker,
stupid motherfucker.

174
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,120
He didn't react. He doesn't do nothing
for me, like he doesn't know me.

175
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:59,000
Fuck Aristide. You don't know me?
Of course I know you. You know me.

176
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,040
When I got out, I go in my town
in Cité Soleil. Fuck...

177
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,040
What I see, baby.

178
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,760
I cannot fight against Aristide
with guns. No, no, no.

179
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,240
I say I'm gonna take
another way, baby.

180
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,440
I'm gonna fight against
him with my music.

181
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,560
<i>All you sleepyheads, wake up</i>

182
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,160
<i>Listen to the guard of the cemetery</i>

183
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,400
<i>The war has just begun</i>
<i>We will not surrender</i>

184
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,520
<i>We're men of strength</i>
<i>We don't make mistakes</i>

185
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,120
<i>The spirits gave my balls power</i>
<i>to ring the bells at noon</i>

186
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,640
<i>He makes me invincible</i>
<i>Like it or not, this is his will</i>

187
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,760
<i>My machete's too sharp</i>
<i>Nobody can't touch me</i>

188
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,880
<i>These words are nuclear weapons</i>
<i>They'll silence you</i>

189
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,800
<i>My bullets will go through you</i>
<i>You won't even know it</i>

190
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,960
<i>We're too strong for you</i>

191
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,920
Oh my God!

192
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:58,280
Oh Lord, man. That motherfucker
made that music in prison.

193
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,000
Me and him sat down.
We said, hey, look man

194
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,840
what kind of music
we got to write, man?

195
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,480
Me, I used to sing only outlaw music.

196
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,440
That was only thing I sang about.
Being a gangster. Criminal.

197
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,360
Normal shit... killing people.

198
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,520
Couldn't get them with a gun?
We'd get them with machetes.

199
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,200
We don't fuck around.
Fuck you up with a baseball bat.

200
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,320
But this gentleman said no.

201
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,640
Wyclef, what's up? It's 2pac.

202
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,320
-It's Wyclef Jean.
-What's going on, Clef?

203
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,440
-Word up, my man.
-You know why I call myself Pac?

204
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:39,520
Cause I'm not stupid, man.
Tupac was a smart motherfucker.

205
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,160
When I say I'm talking to 2pac,
I have to say it's not American Tupac.

206
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,240
I tell them the real 2pac is
from Cité Soleil, partner.

207
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,560
I made this song about
our youth, it's my story.

208
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,800
I wrote it in prison.
I can make a great album.

209
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,640
Listen to this. Let me sing it for you.
Please listen.

210
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,800
<i>The Life of Our Youth.</i>

211
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,480
<i>I invite you to sit and listen</i>
<i>to a story gone bad</i>

212
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,360
<i>The story of our youth</i>

213
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,880
<i>It's the story of a boy</i>
<i>who's barely seventeen</i>

214
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,520
<i>He had some talent</i>
<i>Could have been somebody</i>

215
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,080
<i>The police changed his fate</i>
<i>Turned him into nothing</i>

216
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,640
<i>How did his fate turn out</i>
Clef, listen.

217
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,040
<i>2pac's talent was singing</i>

218
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,840
<i>The police hated him</i>
<i>Threw him in jail</i>

219
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,920
<i>He was still in 4th grade</i>
<i>They sentenced him to life</i>

220
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,360
<i>He'd done nothing wrong</i>
<i>Just smoking weed</i>

221
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,680
<i>Look how they brought him down</i>
<i>He became a victim</i>

222
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,920
<i>For a year and a half</i>
<i>Being way too young</i>

223
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,440
<i>He endured a heavy sentence</i>
<i>Went down and down</i>

224
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,120
<i>We need support and guidance</i>
<i>We have to tell them that</i>

225
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,600
<i>A lot of support and guidance</i>
<i>We have to tell them that</i>

226
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,600
Come listen to my music, Amaral.
Come listen to my music.

227
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,440
<i>Becoming a victim</i>

228
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,960
<i>Being way too young</i>
<i>He endured a heavy sentence</i>

229
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,360
<i>I will go down</i>
Fucking go down, nigga!

230
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:44,080
We already passed St. Marc
on our way to the capital.

231
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,080
When we arrive at the capital,
there will only be one solution!

232
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,680
We will take the National Palace.

233
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,960
We used to be with Lavalas.

234
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,800
Lavalas paid for sticks and machetes
so we could beat the people.

235
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,480
Since Lavalas killed my brother,
we revolted against Aristide.

236
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:53,680
If those guys get Aristide out, one
of them will be president? Fuck that!

237
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:59,120
I'm not happy with the opposition.
I'm just telling you they may win.

238
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,920
So you want to fight
until the end for Aristide?

239
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:07,800
Until you are...
until your death for Aristide.

240
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,640
That's how it is, Lele.
He can't give it up now.

241
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,000
They take me for a gangster, not
a person who wants development.

242
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:20,000
You think those guys will leave me
alone? Stop calling me Chimere?

243
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,560
They know a lot of Chimeres
don't have a choice.

244
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,680
Okay, why do they know that
and they don't do nothing?

245
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:33,080
They want to fight with us.

246
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,560
I don't know about Bily.
I'm talking to my little brother.

247
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,800
Lele, I stop, I die.
Anything I do, I die.

248
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,240
Chief Bily!

249
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,080
Everything under control?

250
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,120
-Is everything quiet here?
-We're waiting to see what happens.

251
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,240
-Been working?
-I haven't worked all week.

252
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,760
Well, you should. I think the President
might leave Haiti this week.

253
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,080
I don't know about that.
I don't know.

254
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,000
Okay, bye.

255
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,600
How you guys doing?

256
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,880
Trying to get money for school.

257
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,720
I'll give you some money
for food and for school.

258
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,120
Voilà!

259
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:47,320
I hear people calling me
a gangster and a Chimere.

260
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,240
But nobody wants to help
people advance here.

261
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,920
Nobody wants to help people
get an education.

262
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:03,480
If you just listen to your kids,
then you'll hear what they need.

263
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,000
Then you'll help them.

264
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,120
<i>I am the bull</i>

265
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,200
<i>Your daddy is not going to die there</i>

266
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,320
<i>I'm already a bull</i>

267
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:22,440
<i>Your papa bull is not</i>
<i>going to die out there</i>

268
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:29,160
Bily is just a kid.
Somehow he's my kid.

269
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,120
I don't want to lose
the same way Bily did.

270
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,440
They fucked with Bily's head,
made him a Lavalas.

271
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,400
I bought Bily a gun.
He gave it to the government.

272
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,040
What is that shit?
I paid $800 for that gun!

273
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:48,320
I said I gave it to you.
He goes: "It belongs to the boss!"

274
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,120
You can't do that shit in Cité Soleil!

275
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,320
He runs his gang
like a police station.

276
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,320
What kind of bullshit is that!
He complicates things.

277
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,400
Bily! Bily!

278
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,920
Bily! Bily!

279
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,640
Bily...!

280
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,320
What's going on?

281
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,880
Chief Bily...!

282
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,560
Ghana has a bullet in the...

283
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,720
... in the feet.

284
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,440
Billy told me
Ghana was saying bullshit.

285
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,960
Somehow not respecting what he was
saying. So he shot him in the feet.

286
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,760
Shot!
And Ghana was my soldier.

287
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,200
Bily got a problem with Ghana.

288
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,560
I'm not gonna accept, baby!

289
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,520
I told him: Shit! Can you send
somebody to send him to hospital.

290
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,880
He says:
Nobody can. Only you.

291
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,920
I told him I cannot come.
It's really insecure for me.

292
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,440
He says: Lele, I love you.

293
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,840
I gave orders.
Everybody knows your car.

294
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,880
You're safe.
You can come.

295
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,200
He is by the chocolate colored door.

296
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,040
Ghana!

297
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,080
-Hello. I'll go check on him.
-Open the gate.

298
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,720
Try the other rock!

299
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,520
Good morning, Ghana.

300
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,680
Lele, my girl... friend.

301
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,920
Friend, not girl.

302
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,040
What's going on, Lele?
Everything okay?

303
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,000
Bily likes Lele so much.

304
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,840
He likes her.

305
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,880
This is for you.
Don't spend it on girls.

306
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,840
No, I won't give it to nobody.
I won't spend it on girls.

307
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,480
-It's for yourself.
-Not for girls.

308
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,760
-I know you.
-You know me?

309
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,360
I need money to eat,
not for girls.

310
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,920
I need it to live.

311
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:26,159
How do you know
I spend money on girls, Lele?

312
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,840
You don't give it
to them directly, but...

313
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,120
I don't give girls money.

314
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,199
I give money to the people,
not to girls.

315
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,760
He believes in voodoo shit.
Come on, fuck voodoo, man.

316
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,560
Fuck God.
Fuck voodoo, brother.

317
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,680
Fuck everybody, man.

318
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,560
Believe me, I believe
in my own finger.

319
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,320
I believe in that, baby, that!

320
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:49,920
I'm aiming to reach the National
Palace, throw Aristide in jail

321
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,480
or shoot him!

322
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:19,200
Today, in Haiti, we have terrorists,
drug dealers, criminals

323
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,240
acting and killing innocent people.

324
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,960
They killed more than 5,000 people.

325
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,120
Now they are back
to kill more people.

326
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:04,120
I spent ten years in exile,
ten years in the Dominican Republic

327
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,840
thinking about how
I could come back...

328
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,720
... come back to Haiti

329
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,000
to liberate the people
from the dictatorship of Aristide.

330
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,160
If Bush and the international
community knew exactly

331
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,440
what's going in Haiti, they would
abandon Aristide immediately.

332
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,760
My aunt is always upset
because I'm a Chimere.

333
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,880
We're all mean.
If you're mean, I'm mean.

334
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,040
If you do something to me,
I can do the same to you.

335
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,520
-Did you take my car?
-I'm not mean to you.

336
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,960
You're my mother.
I didn't steal it.

337
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,520
-I borrowed it, that's all.
-It wasn't borrowed.

338
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:24,760
-Not borrowed, what then?
-It was taken.

339
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,280
-I was in a hurry.
-You were in a hurry.

340
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,240
If I'm lying, I'll die.
But I'm not, so I can't die.

341
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:39,200
God in heaven is protecting me.
That's why I can't die.

342
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:44,360
That's from your voodoo priestess.

343
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,440
With this I can't die.

344
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,040
-But you don't like it?
-The doctor is coming.

345
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,400
Gabriel said, Boss, I'm gonna
be with you forever.

346
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,480
Everywhere you go, I will go
with you. I'm your bodyguard.

347
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,240
He's a stupid motherfucker.
He can't write his name.

348
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,600
His school is killing people, that's it.

349
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,000
Gabriel is my soldier.
Franzo is my soldier.

350
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,600
You see them niggas,
you got to run, baby.

351
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,480
This is Franzo's daughter.

352
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,720
Franzo, please. Stay cool now.
Don't get all hot, okay?

353
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,840
Stay cool like me.

354
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,360
Got a match?

355
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:59,080
Not like that. Don't...!
Just give it to me.

356
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,200
See, nigga? Don't play.

357
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:07,600
You fuck with us, you gonna die.
That's Franzo and Pac.

358
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,440
Let me hear it click, dog.

359
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,640
We know you have a temper.
Shit, man. Let's hear it.

360
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,720
Yes, thank you very much.
We heard it.

361
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,680
Franzo's a great guy.
Great guy.

362
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,480
Franzo will die. He's crazy.
He pulls his gun on me.

363
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,760
But Bily, you can't just say
Franzo's gotta die.

364
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,760
-Cut Franzo loose. He don't listen.
-He don't listen to nobody.

365
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,480
I told you, man.
He's gonna die like this.

366
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:45,880
He's all alone in Cité Soleil.
No mother, no father. Only likes war.

367
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,280
No more fucking bullshit.
I'm gonna take his gun away.

368
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,360
What's going on, motherfuckers?

369
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,800
-What's going on?
-Yeah, 2pac.

370
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,160
Franzo, sweetheart.
I love you, you know that.

371
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,120
Lots of love. When I tell you
to do something, do it!

372
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,360
I would never ask you for something
that's not good for you.

373
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,400
You don't understand
what's going on.

374
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,120
You know me, Franzo.
I love you.

375
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,640
-They want to kill me.
-I know.

376
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,440
I don't want you to die.
If you die, I lose. Okay, partner?

377
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,320
2pac, my dream is
to have my own gang.

378
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,280
If Bily tries to fuck with me,
I'll pull my gun on him.

379
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,120
He needs to run if he sees me.

380
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,960
Know why you'll die?
Cause that's how life is, Franzo.

381
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,160
The more you kill,
the shorter your life becomes.

382
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,360
But 2pac, you know I have an Uzi.

383
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,280
Listen up, Franzo.

384
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,080
If you go looking for trouble,
you're gonna die.

385
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,400
You'll be dead real soon.
There's nothing to do.

386
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,760
Play the game good.
You're not playing it well.

387
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,320
Bullshit.
You're stupid, imbecile!

388
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,200
Franzo is a two-faced motherfucker.

389
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:19,400
He doesn't say fuck you to my
face, but he pulls his gun on me.

390
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,400
Yes, he doesn't respect you.

391
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:26,600
Everybody wants to kill him,
but they don't, because of me.

392
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,000
Franzo's a kid.
You have to pull his ears.

393
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:34,000
But you can talk to him, you know.

394
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,600
Franzo: <i>So kill me here, sweetheart.</i>
<i>Bily, I'm right here.</i>

395
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:42,960
<i>Come and kill me right here.</i>
<i>I'm ready to die, Bily.</i>

396
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,680
That's fucking bullshit.

397
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,320
I'll give him a bullet
so he won't do that again.

398
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:03,320
Come on. One bullet and then
you'll have to pay for hospital.

399
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,400
I won't send you any money.

400
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,840
-I already had to pay for Ghana.
-Why did you feel obliged to do that?

401
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,320
I can't let someone with
no money take a bullet.

402
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:17,080
-You don't have to kill anyone.
-But he doesn't respect me.

403
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,400
Give him a second chance.

404
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,280
No, I have to give him a bullet
to make him respect me.

405
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,040
Chiefs, chiefs, chiefs!
Respect, respect...

406
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:32,600
Who made me chief? You think
someone asked me to be a chief? No.

407
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,480
I get respect
because I respect people.

408
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:41,240
You think if you shoot him
in the leg, he'll respect you?

409
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:47,120
No need for respect. I'll make him
fear me and then kill him good.

410
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,560
<i>They say times are changing</i>

411
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,680
<i>If I had money</i>
<i>I'd be in Miami</i>

412
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,920
Bily's crazy, man.
Bily's crazy.

413
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,800
He knows who he's fucking with.

414
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,640
What is he doing with that M-14?

415
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,480
Give me that. What the hell is
Gabriel doing with that gun?

416
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,760
-But we should all have guns now.
-Get down now.

417
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:28,000
-Give it to me.
-No, 2pac, this is the only one.

418
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,560
I can't go without a weapon.
Do you want to kill me?

419
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,960
-Get down, right now.
-Don't do it, Bily. Bily!

420
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,960
Give the gun to 2pac.

421
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,840
Give it to him, right now!

422
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,240
Gabriel,
I'm gonna shoot you!

423
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,680
Go get him!

424
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:58,680
No reason to shoot!
Don't shoot, Bily!

425
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:04,000
I'm not scared, Bily!
Not scared of you, Bily!

426
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,760
Stay out of it, Franzo!

427
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,800
Bily wants to kill us!
Bily wants to kill us!

428
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,640
-Where is Bily going?
-Don't shoot him!

429
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,960
You can't do that!
You can't do that!

430
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:34,480
-Gabriel!
-2pac! 2pac! 2pac!

431
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,120
-Oh, 2pac!
-Give me that!

432
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,840
Okay, let's go! Let's go!

433
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,960
They just called me on the telephone.
Told me Gabriel is dead.

434
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:14,080
They shot him up in his neck.
With a shotgun.

435
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:19,400
I told him, don't go downtown.
I know he has enemies downtown.

436
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,640
Dead by a fucking cop.

437
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,880
Franzo was there with Gabriel.

438
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Franzo told me, Boss, shit man,
I'm crying like a motherfucker.

439
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,320
Gabriel died in front of me.
I can't do nothing.

440
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,920
They asked me what the hell
I'm gonna do for the funeral

441
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:43,360
cause they know somehow
I'm in charge of that.

442
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,360
Fuck.

443
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,880
Save your life, you know.
Take another way.

444
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,360
I try to explain to them,
but they don't understand.

445
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:28,560
-What's happening?
-There's no power. They cut it off.

446
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:32,120
Let's go to the service place.

447
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,880
-Does he have...?
-Yeah, baby. He has a big generator.

448
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,080
In the house!
This is my town, baby!

449
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:49,600
I need the generator.
You know Gabriel was my boy.

450
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,320
I was told Wednesday.

451
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,120
I'm gonna shoot someone today.
Bullets are gonna fly.

452
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,240
If you don't go get our generator,
I'll make serious trouble.

453
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:04,360
I would never make trouble for you.
No, no, no, no.

454
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,840
Hey! Are you giving me shit?

455
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,960
No, no!
2pac, that's not it.

456
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:13,800
-Somebody already booked it.
-Booked it?

457
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,520
If I made problems for you,
I'll make it up to you.

458
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,560
I swear to God
we'll find a generator.

459
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,680
It's my town, baby.

460
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,200
It's like that.

461
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,920
<i>It's no lie</i>
<i>This is 2pac's dream</i>

462
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,840
<i>Corrupt and greedy</i>
<i>Thief. President</i>

463
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,960
Yeah, that's me and
my girlfriend, nigga.

464
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,560
Me and my angel, nigga.
Baby, please give me a kiss.

465
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:32,560
Black and white, nigga.
We love each other for real.

466
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,360
Yes, man, what's up?
That's yours?

467
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:44,080
-Lele, you will get that?
-No, I need to talk to you.

468
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,960
What happened?

469
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:53,400
Since not long, since
a few days, I have some guy.

470
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,720
And the guy is your brother.

471
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,320
So that's the situation now.

472
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,280
-Now you're joking.
-No, I'm not joking.

473
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:16,320
-What do you think about it?
-Me? To me, it's a joke.

474
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:20,440
-No, it's not a joke. Really.
-Yeah.

475
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,200
So Aristide go.
I told you, man.

476
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,760
That's what I wrote in my music.

477
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,080
I knew he had to go.
Get the fuck out of here.

478
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,400
That's why I'm happy, nigga.

479
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,520
We're here! We're here!

480
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,520
The President left,
but we're still here.

481
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,000
They're gonna come looking for us.

482
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:19,560
Guy Philippe said
we're the cause of all the trouble.

483
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:24,440
But me and five guys will
make him run like a thief.

484
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:30,560
Bily gave me a gun,
so I could go out and fight.

485
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,440
I'm ready for the war.

486
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,520
I want to say that

487
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,960
with a trembling voice

488
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:28,720
that this warm welcome
this morning...

489
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,120
... makes me feel very good.

490
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:37,840
Because I'm back in my country,
I'm with my people.

491
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,440
I have no problems with the police

492
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:44,840
not with the policemen
or with the people.

493
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:49,760
We have problems with the Chimeres
and the chiefs of the Chimeres

494
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:55,000
who are crazy, and have done
nothing for the country or the people.

495
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,240
From 1804 to 2004,
that's 200 years!

496
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:10,600
200 years of independence.
200 years!

497
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,160
What did you ask me?

498
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,680
We are the people of Cité Soleil.

499
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:22,200
We fought hard to get
Aristide as our President.

500
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,520
Tell little Bush
we need three things.

501
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:27,480
The Haitian people
have three prayers:

502
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,600
School for our kids.
Food. Sleep.

503
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,360
We don't need peace.

504
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:40,000
We need the Chimeres to fight

505
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:44,800
the extravagant systems
right here in Cité Soleil.

506
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,920
Look at us today.

507
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,840
I feel like killing you
to take your camera.

508
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,080
I'm satisfied we got rid
of the dictator.

509
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:10,080
We need to prevent
the destruction of Port-au-Prince.

510
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,520
The Chimeres are still around.

511
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,520
We are at the service of
the government to disarm them.

512
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,680
I saw the guy who gave the order
to Guy Philippe to go to La Saline

513
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,000
not to Cité Soleil. They will make
the decision tomorrow at five

514
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:30,520
so you need to speak
with them before.

515
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:34,000
Cause they're afraid of you
and all your guns.

516
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,600
They don't know what you want...
if you are still for Aristide or not.

517
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,080
Okay, talk with Dread now.

518
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:46,120
Make a decision, but you should
negotiate or they may attack.

519
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:07,360
-No more Chimeres!
-Chimeres are nothing but trouble.

520
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,800
Hello, Guy.
How are you doing?

521
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,360
No, not at all. I'm in Cité
Soleil with the chiefs now.

522
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:33,040
-I will pass you on.
-Hello?

523
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,160
I am Bily, you understand?

524
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,640
In Cité Soleil, we are four chiefs.
We don't want no more violence.

525
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:44,280
We can guarantee
that the violence stops.

526
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,320
If we make it stop, it's not
cause people here are afraid

527
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:52,440
of the rebels,
it's cause people are gonna die.

528
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:56,240
It's always people from
Cité Soleil who are the victims.

529
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:00,360
Now I lay down my weapons.
My hands are in my pockets.

530
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:08,720
No, I'm not afraid of being attacked.

531
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:13,520
I'm worried about my people,
I'm not worried about myself.

532
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:17,800
Before talking to you, calls started
coming from Lavalas members

533
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,960
who asked me to stay with them

534
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,320
to start a new rebellion
like in Gonaives.

535
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:29,520
But we'll stay cool as long as you
respect that we have rights too.

536
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:32,000
If you think you can disarm us

537
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:35,280
and then massacre us,
we won't tolerate that.

538
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,880
We're ready for war, but if it's
about stopping the violence

539
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,200
and for everyone
to be able to live in peace

540
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,360
and give jobs to the people

541
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:49,720
then we'll support anyone
who comes to power.

542
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,560
Hello?

543
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:56,640
Bravo, Bily. Shit!
You told Philippe.

544
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:04,000
-What do you think, Bily?
-What?

545
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:07,360
I don't know what you should do, but
you should give the old weapons.

546
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:13,160
You pretend you give, but you
don't give them your weapons.

547
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,280
You tell them you don't trust them

548
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,400
because everywhere they've been,
Africa, Eastern Europe

549
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,520
each time it has been a massacre.

550
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,800
You know, we come
to protect you, they say.

551
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:26,520
It's true they want to,
but then after...

552
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:32,000
I don't want my people to die,
my soldiers to die.

553
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:38,280
I know now it's not the time.

554
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,400
It's not the right time
to have enemies.

555
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:46,480
It's time to have friends,
not enemies.

556
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:51,840
My niggas, my people,
I care for their lives.

557
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,800
Yo, Clef.

558
01:00:54,920 --> 01:01:00,640
Yeah, we've got guns in Cité Soleil,
but we've got talents too.

559
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,720
People think we're the devil.
It's not true, man.

560
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,680
I said we gotta talk to Wyclef.
He can give us support.

561
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,360
Our story is your story.
Cité Soleil respects you.

562
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:15,040
Only you sing with respect
for Cité Soleil. Understand?

563
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:19,520
Like in the song,
<i>Cité Soleil, don't be afraid.</i>

564
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:23,960
Do you know how many people have
guns in Cité Soleil? Three thousand.

565
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:27,880
We've got three thousand soldiers.
They've got arms, big arms.

566
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,200
They promise we'll have security
when we give up the guns.

567
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:35,400
Then the rebels come looking for us,
what we're gonna do?

568
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,000
So we're gonna die.
Our family's gonna die.

569
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,800
We don't want that thing.

570
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:44,000
What we need? We need peace.
We don't want to fight each other.

571
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,600
We don't want no more people
die in Cité Soleil

572
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:51,520
cause we die of hunger already,
why we gonna die by arms now?

573
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:51,680
<i>Aristide, five more years.</i>
<i>Aristide, five more years.</i>

574
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:03,600
<i>Justice for the little man is death</i>

575
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:07,720
<i>You're coming to my house</i>
<i>looking for resistance</i>

576
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:10,840
<i>Some people don't know</i>
<i>what I did for my country</i>

577
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,760
<i>They say, where is he?</i>
<i>He's a gangster</i>

578
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,640
<i>And all I tried to do</i>
<i>was free Haiti</i>

579
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:55,640
The military is here.
I don't want to be with you.

580
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:40,320
Fuck that shit, man!
No power in Haiti.

581
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:44,480
You see, what happened.
Power is a gun in Haiti.

582
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:51,880
If you don't have a gun,
no power.

583
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,840
-Big fucking problem.
-What?

584
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:01,240
They got Amaral.
They beat him up. The military.

585
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,960
-The military?
-Yes, the American forces.

586
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:07,400
Some snitches said Dread Wilmer
was going to see Amaral.

587
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:12,160
This morning they got Amaral and
beat him up to get Dread Wilmer?

588
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:17,000
Labanye knew Aristide would go. He
acts like he's not for Aristide no more.

589
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,920
Now Labanye can do what he
wanna do, man. You know?

590
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:24,120
Make a phone call: Hey, cop.
Dread went to Amaral's house.

591
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:29,400
Go get him for me, please.
Now Labanye is the fucking boss.

592
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:38,320
In Cité Soleil, in one place,
there can't be two chiefs, never.

593
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:42,120
When you have two chiefs,
they always fight each other.

594
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,520
It's a game. Sometimes to lose,
sometimes to win

595
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:49,040
but I really want to win,
I don't want to lose.

596
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:52,160
If I lose, I die.
If I die, I lose.

597
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,600
No more Pac, fuck Pac.
They will forget me.

598
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:00,400
But if I go away to another country

599
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:03,640
still make my music,
they will always think about Pac.

600
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,640
-What's happening?
-Something's going on.

601
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,400
-Where?
-There was some shooting.

602
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:26,080
-Where?
-Lots of bullets.

603
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:31,200
You see, I'm chilling.
I just wake up in my bed.

604
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:36,880
And now I'm going to fight. For what?
I wake up in my bed, man.

605
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,800
Let me see.

606
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:44,840
Over here, this way.
It was over here.

607
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,560
Fuck your mother!

608
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:50,760
What is this shit?

609
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:06,960
Get in the car.
Come get in the car, man.

610
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,320
It's war.

611
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,680
Kill the motherfucker!

612
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,000
2pac!

613
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:22,399
Labanye and Pac are fighting.

614
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:24,840
Labanye and Pac.

615
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,319
I gotta get the hell outta here, dog.

616
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:35,560
If I stay, I'm going to die.

617
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,720
2pac is a motherfucker, man.
He is going back to jail.

618
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:43,800
Why do you want him to go back
to jail? It's worse than death.

619
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,760
He doesn't respect me.
Yesterday I lost my gun.

620
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:50,880
He has one gun and he had
50 Cent put it somewhere.

621
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,800
I tell 50 Cent to get the gun
so I can borrow it.

622
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:58,439
-And you would give it back?
-Yeah, cause he's not in Cité Soleil.

623
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:03,760
My life is not okay.
All this happens to me cause of 2pac.

624
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:08,840
I'm coming down there, baby.
Okay? You're with me now.

625
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:12,960
Yes, I hear what you're saying.
I hear you.

626
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,560
Okay, just hide that gun.

627
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:21,399
Don't give it to him. If you do,
then you're not my friend.

628
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,640
Okay, baby. I love you.

629
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,880
Listen, I'm gonna put
a bullet in his ass.

630
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,560
If he tries to take that gun,
do what you have to do!

631
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:38,399
You hear me?
No matter what it is!

632
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:41,479
I don't have a brother any more.

633
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,080
Fuck Bily, man.
Lele, listen to my music.

634
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,279
Fuck him!

635
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:54,880
You see, me and 2pac,
we're never relaxed.

636
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Every time, we get into a fight.

637
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,680
It's for 2pac I do what I do.

638
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:03,160
But if 2pac was not my brother,
I'd kill him already.

639
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:06,760
I always act like I trust him.

640
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,480
Always act like that.

641
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,800
But in my heart I don't trust him.

642
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:18,560
I don't really know
if he's my enemy or my brother.

643
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:22,160
And he has soldiers.
That's the big problem.

644
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:24,760
If I wanna kill Bily right now, I can!

645
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:29,640
Like I told you.
Him too. He's a chief.

646
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:35,360
If he wanna do something, he can
give the message to his soldiers

647
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:38,320
and I'll die and after,
he'll act like it's not him.

648
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:41,520
He will cry like a little baby.
It's like that, Lele.

649
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,760
We're Haitian, man.

650
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:54,280
Bily is trying to be the chief,
but everybody knows I am.

651
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,920
He is crazy!
They know who is chief. They know.

652
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:01,080
The only way for him right now
is to kill me.

653
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:04,680
He can't. Killing your brother
would be disgusting.

654
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,080
The people of Soleil 19
would never accept it.

655
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:13,760
Know why I gotta leave Cité Soleil?
I don't want to kill my brother.

656
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,880
-It would be ugly. See what I mean?
-It would be ugly.

657
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:21,400
That's my problem. He wants to be
chief, so I let him be chief.

658
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,920
His problem is the other chiefs.
They will destroy him.

659
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:28,600
Now what's left is the hate.
It always destroys you.

660
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:32,480
I take care of myself,
but I know I'm gonna die.

661
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:39,600
One day I'll die,
but only God knows when.

662
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:42,080
Only God.

663
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,680
Hello, it's Lele.

664
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,240
It's true.
There's a warrant against you.

665
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:56,800
They want to make an example
and clean up before the UN arrives.

666
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:01,120
If you stay another day,
they're going to arrest you.

667
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:13,480
My name is Léon Charles.
I am the Chief of Police in Haiti.

668
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,480
There is a hard wing.

669
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:25,920
The hardcore of the gangs

670
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:30,640
are identified as people like
Labanye, Amaral, Dread Wilmer

671
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,440
2pac, Bily.

672
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:38,400
We're looking for them.

673
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:42,880
We published pictures

674
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,680
of 30 gang leaders in the papers.

675
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:54,320
Earlier, the police
could not arrest them.

676
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:59,120
Now I have the power
to arrest whoever I want

677
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:04,440
committing any crimes
in the streets of Port-au-Prince.

678
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:10,920
So I have to leave Haiti,
but I don't know how.

679
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,000
Man...

680
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:22,160
Like Wyclef say, when the doors
close, you find another one open.

681
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:28,560
But it's not true. I find the door's
closed, I can't find another open.

682
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:33,040
Every door is closed.
For me, every door is closed.

683
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:35,960
All the doors, man.

684
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:20,000
The police caught Bily behind
the market. Let's go, Lele.

685
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:23,000
Lele, let's go please.

686
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,720
Damn those people.

687
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,800
Fuck them cops.

688
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:34,760
They catch my brother.
How I'm gonna be cool?

689
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:39,080
A lot of cops are not Lavalas.
They're for the opposition.

690
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:42,200
When they catch you,
you ain't got no chance.

691
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:45,200
You're gonna die.
He's gonna kill you, man.

692
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:47,040
My little brother's dead?

693
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:51,960
You think if I see a cop, I'm gonna
fuck with him? Play with him?

694
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,360
They're gonna get shot, dog.
Believe me!

695
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:57,960
Kill my blood? Kill you too,
motherfucker. It's like that, baby.

696
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,640
Niggas gonna die, man.

697
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:06,520
Fuck them cops. I'm ready to die.
We're gonna make war.

698
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,040
In front of the Americans, they say
they're gonna arrest you.

699
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:13,480
If the Americans aren't there,
they're gonna kill you.

700
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:19,600
That's the big problem in Haiti
since the beginning in Aristide.

701
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:22,920
When Aristide came back, he didn't
want to sit with the Macoute.

702
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,080
He made us Lavalas kill Macoute

703
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:30,320
and now that the opposition is back,
they're gonna kill Lavalas.

704
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:33,440
It's always like that. When the
opposition goes, Lavalas comes.

705
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:39,120
It's gonna keep killing, killing, killing.
Haiti will never be changed.

706
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:56,480
Now I gotta get some money
and leave this fucking country.

707
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:36,920
This is my brother. Shut the camera.
This is my brother, my cop.

708
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:40,040
He's going now,
to make a license for me.

709
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:44,080
Tomorrow, baby. If the license comes
tomorrow, we're okay, man.

710
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:51,480
Now it's only me, man.

711
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:55,640
Like I say, just me against the world.

712
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,960
I've got nothing to lose now, baby.

713
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,440
Nothing.

714
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,960
Just Taina.

715
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:25,000
Man.
If my mother was alive...

716
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:29,320
... good luck, my son.

717
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:34,200
Do a good thing.
Don't make me ashamed.

718
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:37,880
She was always like that,
don't make me ashamed.

719
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,080
Now she's dead.

720
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:44,520
She's in the sky for me, cause
she was a really good woman.

721
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:47,280
She's in the sky, man,
with the angels.

722
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:51,800
But me, I'm not gonna
be with my mom now. I know.

723
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:55,400
I know.

724
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,880
I'm scared, man.
Like tomorrow, I'll go away.

725
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,360
I got to go.

726
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,360
I will go.

727
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:12,200
No matter what, you gotta believe
in your destination, baby.

728
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,640
How is my life going to be?
I don't know.

729
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:18,320
I don't know.

730
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:22,080
Maybe good, maybe bad.
I don't know.

731
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:25,720
Lord knows.
