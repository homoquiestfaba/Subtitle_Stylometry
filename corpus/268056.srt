2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,960
Marker.

5
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,080
Jamal!

7
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,080
Jamal, are you awake?

9
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,040
I know you can hear me.

11
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,160
l´m writing all this down.
I have that thing with your teacher...

13
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,720
...then l´m working late. So you´lI have to
take care of yourseIf for dinner, okay?

15
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,200
-Okay?
-Okay.

17
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,440
I thought you wanted to get up by 7:30.

19
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,040
Hear the chains sing?

21
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,880
Check that up, man.

23
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,960
Hold on. What up, J? Where you been?

25
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,240
Asleep, yo.

27
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,120
I was up late
wondering how l´d save your ass out here.

29
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,000
What are you saving?

31
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,400
J, break him up, man.

33
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,040
You can´t give him that.

35
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,800
-You can´t give him that.
-l´m awake now.

37
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,840
You got something for me?

39
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,800
Soufflé, baby!

41
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
You got nothing for me.

43
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,960
A lot of good that´s doing.

45
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,000
He´s bringing something for the Window.

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,400
-You ever seen him?
-The Window?

49
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,880
No, but he see us, man.

51
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,520
Come on, man.

53
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,760
What´s wrong with y´all?
Don´t you want to play ball?

55
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,760
Wake up.

57
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,040
In 1845...

59
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,440
...Poe wrote his most famous piece,
The Raven.

61
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,840
A poem he wrote while he was strung out
on coke and obsessed with death.

63
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,560
The Raven is like the football team.

65
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,960
They´re obsessed with death,
always get their ass kicked.

67
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,720
Baltimore Ravens: only pro football team
named after a classic poem.

69
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,880
Anyone read it?

71
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,840
´´Once upon a midnight dreary

73
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,440
´´while I pondered weak and weary´"

75
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,640
Jamal, how about it?

77
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,280
I never read it.

79
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,160
Okay, I need those essays by next Tuesday.

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,400
My dad saw the Window, man.
About 20 years ago.

83
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,080
Standing there like a ghost,
like the ones in our science books.

85
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,200
Just like that, man.

87
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,120
-He was white?
-Ain´t milk white?

89
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,040
What ghost isn´t white?

91
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,480
l´m just playing, man.

93
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,360
I heard he killed someone.
That´s why he stays inside.

95
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,760
Listen, you got to kill an army
to have to hide here.

97
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,880
Y´all play too much. Remember Shurrita?
The one who lived below the Window?

99
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,400
She calls me up
this one night buggin´, dog.

101
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,200
Saying how she heard a tapping sound
coming from the Window´s place.

103
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,040
Tap....

105
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,600
While she was on the phone,
she started screaming.

107
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,320
´Cause now the tapping has made its way
downstairs somehow.

109
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,040
Tap....

111
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,360
And now it was on the other side
of her door.

113
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,640
She could tell he was tapping
with some kind of knife.

115
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,240
And then the phone disconnected.
That was the last time we seen Shurrita.

117
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,080
Shurrita who lived across the street?

119
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,800
That girl is a crack ho.

121
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,560
No, she was nice.

123
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,240
All I know is the Window´s bad news.

125
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,560
Rules was...

127
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,440
...if you went outside, you stayed away
from the Window´s place.

129
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,840
We need to stay away from your lying ass.

131
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,280
You believe me, right?

133
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,240
You full of shit, dog.

135
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,960
Damn.

137
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,880
Let me guess. You´d go up in there, right?

139
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,880
lt´s an old man looking out a window.

141
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,320
You´d go up there, right?

143
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,720
-He won´t go.
-Let them know, J.

145
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,720
-He won´t go.
-This nigga´s scared.

147
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,120
Yo, I got the next call.

149
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,040
-So?
-So...

151
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,800
...I dare you to go up there, right?

153
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,120
Right?

155
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,320
Whatever, man. l´ll go up there. Yeah.

157
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,560
-He´s going.
-Big shot.

159
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,000
Bring it on.

161
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,640
That´s my dog.

163
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,840
D, I believe you, dog.

165
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,720
Shut up. Go to class or something.

167
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,240
Here, man. Sit over here.

169
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,920
-Stop playing with me.
-This is my birthday.

171
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,880
Go over there.

173
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,040
-Fine. I won´t sit near you.
-Take your apple, too.

175
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,400
-Miss Joyce?
-Yeah.

177
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,280
-Good to see you.
-You, too. Come, sit down.

179
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,000
We got Jamal´s test scores back.

181
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,440
-Test scores?
-Assessment tests.

183
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,200
All of the kids are required to take them.

185
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,440
He didn´t tell you, did he?

187
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,000
Mrs. Wallace,
Jamal maintains a C average...

189
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,520
...which means he does enough to get by
and just enough not to stand out.

191
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,040
What makes Jamal´s case unusual
are his test results.

193
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,880
Oh, my God.

195
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,880
I see him reading these books all the time.
Books I never read.

197
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,560
Some l´ve never even heard of.
And he´s always writing in his notebooks.

199
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,480
Ever since his father left.
But that´s what I see.

201
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,760
All he ever talks about is basketball.

203
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,320
Basketball is where he gets his acceptance.

205
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,280
The kids here don´t care about
what he can write.

207
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,760
Let´s go! Between the yellow lines!

209
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,120
Yo, T.

211
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,520
-How are you, Fly?
-Maintaining.

213
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,840
You looking for tickets, little bro?

215
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,160
Dead tonight. Sorry about that.

217
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,160
Come on. We know you got tickets.

219
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,080
I got four words for you:

221
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,880
Boss Tunn Red Sox.

223
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,320
The Yanks and Sox tickets
have been sold out for a month.

225
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,960
Okay, Mr. Fly? By the way...

227
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,720
...go tell Camry boy there
to back up his cheap-ass bumper...

229
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,360
...on that Mercedes over there.

231
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,640
Go handle that. Let´s go, Fly!

233
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,080
What the hell, Jamal? Mom called.

235
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,440
-Told me about that test. What´s up?
-Nothing.

237
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,360
What do you mean, ´´nothing´´?

239
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,760
This getting in the way
of your plans or something?

241
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,880
lt was your plan first, T.

243
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,560
Yeah, I know. A little college ball...

245
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,240
...then start signing checks for everyone,
solve their problems.

247
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,720
Look at me, though.

249
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,840
Hold a minute.

251
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,280
Hold onto these.

253
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,920
I guess this makes it our plan now.

255
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,280
One thing.

257
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,080
Don´t tell nobody about them test scores.

259
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,000
Don´t worry. l´m your brother, dog.

261
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,560
Whatever we discuss stays between us.

263
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,760
Love you, dog. All right?

265
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,800
Just remember one thing.

267
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,040
Mom will know when the game ends,
so you take your ass straight home.

269
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,680
Don´t get into no trouble, man. Be careful.
Stay safe. Love, dog.

271
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,040
-Okay, T. Good lookin´.
-Be careful, man.

273
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,920
lt stinks in here.

275
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,400
J, see that window?
He keeps that one cracked sometimes.

277
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,280
The light´s been out for two hours.

279
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,720
You sure he asleep?

281
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,320
That Methuselah´s a thousand years old.
That´s all he ever do.

283
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,440
Yo, J, for the reals, I don´t know about this.

285
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,680
I think l´m-- Shit!

287
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,960
I think l´m pulling the call.

289
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,320
-No, I got this one.
-Rats.

291
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,640
-Yo, Fly.
-Keep it. You got to bring something out.

293
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,760
Man, you hear us, drop down, okay?

295
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,960
Okay.

297
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,840
Don´t stay in there too long.

299
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,480
I got you.

301
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,080
This is rickety.

303
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,880
Oh, shit! Yo, you got something?

305
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,320
-Shit!
-What happened?

307
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,760
You son of a bitch!

309
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,680
Dickheads, he wasn´t asleep.

311
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,080
-Did you see him?
-Not for long.

313
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,640
Stop bouncing that damn ball in the house.

315
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,080
I got Michael Jordan´s name
written in dirt all over my floor.

317
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,520
Don´t worry, l´ll clean it.

319
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,400
I got a better chance
of Michael Jordan cleaning it.

321
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,760
If you´re thinking of a shower,
the hot water´s a bit slow.

323
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,680
-I wasn´t thinking of it.
-Where´s your pack?

325
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,880
-I don´t know.
-´´Don´t know´´?

327
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,800
What do you mean, you don´t know?

329
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,680
We wanted you to bring something,
not leave something.

331
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,600
Why don´t you leave it alone?

333
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,520
What was in your bag?

335
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,960
l´m not talking about the damn bag.

337
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,080
I bet you ain´t.

339
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,120
Let me teach you something.
Watch the eyes.

341
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,960
He´s probably watching you now.

343
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,640
You don´t know about that, man.
Here´s how you do it.

345
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,800
I won´t do anything to your car.

347
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,160
Sorry?

349
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,680
You look worried,
like l´ll do something to your car.

350
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,200
I worry about this car everywhere.
Don´t take it personally.

353
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,960
lt´s just a car, man.

355
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,640
No, it´s not ´´just a car.´´ lt´s a BMW.

357
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,200
Anyone who knows anything
about that company...

359
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,600
...knows that it´s more than ´´just a car.´"

361
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,000
Anybody who knows about that company?

363
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,400
So I wouldn´t know anything like that.

365
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,600
No, that´s not what I meant.

367
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,560
Last thing I knew about BMW...

369
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,560
...was it made plane engines
when it first started.

371
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,560
A guy by the name of Franz Popp
started it all.

373
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,640
Franz Popp. I like that name.

375
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,080
Made this one engine before 1920.
lt flew six miles up.

377
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,920
Popp and his boys
were just getting started.

379
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,640
They made this one engine, the 801,
World War ll, 14 cylinders...

381
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,280
...2,300 horsepower, seven miles up.

383
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,400
With more time, they´d have bombed
the shit out of England...

385
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,520
...maybe even won the war.

387
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,520
That´s where this comes from.

389
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,440
White propeller zipping around a blue sky.

391
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,400
After the war, we told them
they couldn´t make plane engines.

393
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,800
That´s when BMW
gave some serious thought to making cars.

395
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,600
Kind of like this one.

397
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,800
You probably knew all that,
seeing as you lease one.

399
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,240
Thanks for the history lesson.

401
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,560
No problem, man.

408
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,800
Messin´ with my stuff, man.

413
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,200
The other night was....

415
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,160
lt was just this dare thing
me and my boys do.

417
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,240
I was wondering
if I could bring you more of my stuff...

419
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,120
...or maybe I could write something else.

421
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,840
How about 5,000 words on
why you´ll stay the fuck out of my home?

423
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,280
Come on, man. I know you´re in there.

425
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,440
Take your goddamn hand off my door.

427
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,440
I just came...

429
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,520
...to drop off that thing you asked me for.

431
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,120
What thing?

433
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,160
The 5,000 words on why you wanted me
to stay out of your place.

435
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,280
That´s kind of what you said.

437
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,240
Well, try remembering it
exactly as I said it.

439
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,400
Come on in, Jamal.

441
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,880
Hi, honey.

443
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,280
lt´s okay.

445
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,640
Sit down.

447
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,080
Mrs. Wallace, Jamal,
when we got your recent test scores...

449
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,800
...we thought the private schools
might show some interest.

451
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,680
Well, we were right.

453
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,360
-Mr. Bradley.
-My name is David Bradley.

455
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,880
l´m with the Mailor School in Manhattan.

457
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,520
Mailor-Callow?

459
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,200
That´s right. You´re familiar with us?

461
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,480
Yeah.

463
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,200
Mailor-Callow is not only
the best prep school in the city...

465
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,360
...it´s one of the finest private schools
on the East Coast.

467
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,800
Only the best go there.

469
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,200
We´re a few weeks into our fall term...

471
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,120
...but every year we hold some openings
until the test scores come in.

473
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,320
Jamal, your test scores, to put it mildly...

475
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,880
...caught our attention.

477
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,360
l´m here to see if you´d be interested
in attending our school.

479
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,720
Leaving for another school,
especially a private one, won´t be easy.

481
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,720
But this isn´t the right place
for you anymore.

483
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,480
lt´s not a difficult choice.

485
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,120
Mr. Bradley...

487
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,080
...there is no way we could pay for this.

489
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,280
We´re not asking you to.

491
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,000
When Dr. Simon said
only the best go to Mailor...

493
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,120
...he forgot to say our commitment
to excellence goes beyond the classroom.

495
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,480
-I figured that.
-We thought you might.

497
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,480
Mrs. Wallace, 40 of our students
have gone on to play college ball.

499
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,880
Three have made it to professional level.
We evaluated...

501
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,680
...your play last year
and while this is a strictly academic offer...

503
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,360
...we won´t be disappointed if you play.

505
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,880
All we ask is you come out,
take a look, think it over.

507
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,800
-Okay.
-Mrs. Wallace.

509
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,680
-Thank you.
-Jamal.

511
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,000
-Good-bye.
-We´ll be in touch.

513
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,560
I didn´t knock this time.

515
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,560
-To whom were you speaking?
-l´ll tell you if I get my 5,000 words back.

517
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,680
Bolt the door if you´re coming in.

519
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,200
The man in the car?

521
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,920
He was from this private school.

523
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,000
They want me to go there.

525
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,320
We don´t have to pay anything, though.

527
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,040
My mom and I live
a couple of blocks from here.

529
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,160
My brother was there a few years ago,
but he left after my dad left.

531
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,200
My mom got tired of waiting
for my dad to get clean.

533
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,640
And my dad got tired of trying.

535
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,080
That´s when I started writing.

537
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,840
What´s your name?

539
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,640
Jamal Wallace.

541
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,400
Sounds like some kind of marmalade.

543
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,000
How old are you?

545
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,040
l´m 16.

547
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,520
Sixteen?

549
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,280
And you´re black.

551
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,800
-lt´s remarkable.
-´´Remarkable´´?

553
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,880
lt´s remarkable l´m black? What does me
being black have to do with anything?

555
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,160
You don´t know what to do right now,
do you?

557
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:24,000
If you say what you really want to,
I may not read any more of this.

559
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,440
But if you let me run you down
with this racist bullshit...

561
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,880
...what does that make you?

563
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,280
l´m not playing this game, man.

565
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,920
I say you are playing it.

567
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,920
An expression is worth a thousand words.

569
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,840
Perhaps in your case, just two.

571
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,480
Here.

573
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,680
Bum-ass old man.

575
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,320
´´One hand to give, one to receive,
as we eat together in unity.

577
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,000
´´May our minds,
bodies and spirits grow strong.

579
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,440
´´And congratulations to Jamal. Amen.´"

581
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,520
Did you see this?

583
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,880
-Let me see.
-Don´t mess it up.

585
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,840
Wait.

587
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,720
From the cover,
this looks like the funny-man school to me.

589
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,640
Terrell, eat your food.

591
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,920
You´ll be fine.
Mommy don´t make nothing but soldiers.

593
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,920
You could have done the same thing.

595
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,360
I work at a parking lot,
and l´m no regular lot attendant.

597
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,040
I am the supervisor
of all the parking lot attendants.

599
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,000
You never know how much you´ll make
from week to week.

601
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,400
One week it´s $50, the next it´s $100.

603
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,800
-That´s not a real job.
-Ma, leave him alone.

605
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,520
I rap. You know I got my rap thing going.

607
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,560
Don´t bring up the rap. Eat your food.

609
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,480
-Want to hear a song?
-Eat your food.

611
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,920
l´ll sing it for you.

613
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,320
´´When I come due
When I blow the spot

615
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,320
´´Your son, the supervisor
Of the parking lot´´

617
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,760
Tell it, Jamal, my voice is hot, right?

619
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,160
Jamal Wallace?

621
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,760
-Yeah?
-Hi. l´m Claire Spence.

623
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,760
Bradley asked me to show you around.

625
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,600
All right.

627
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,800
Come on.

629
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,160
Besides, the teachers here...

631
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,080
...aren´t that into student participation.

633
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,120
They prefer to hear themselves talk.

635
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,480
-What do you mean?
-You´lI see.

637
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,760
This morning, we begin
our third required reading of the semester.

639
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,240
The study of a novel
that offers everything...

641
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,360
...and an author
who could have offered much more.

643
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,280
That´s Robert Crawford. He´s been here
as long as most of the buildings.

645
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,000
When William Forrester was 23, in 1953...

647
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,720
...he set out to write his first book.

649
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Many aspiring authors talked about
writing the great 20th century novel.

651
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,440
William Forrester did it...

653
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,120
...on his first try.

655
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,960
Have you read this?

657
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,000
Yeah. You?

659
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,360
Only about a dozen times.

661
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,200
This was the only book
he chose to publish.

663
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,560
For all we know,
it was the only one he chose to write.

665
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,480
Your job over the next week
is to read it and tell me why.

667
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,160
So...

669
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,200
...will you be back tomorrow?

671
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,080
Yeah. They want me to spend some time
on the court.

673
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,480
I heard.

675
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,640
Graduation was a little rough
on last year´s team.

677
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,800
But it´s just like college, right?

679
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,320
You get an education
and they get what they want.

681
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,520
Maybe you both get what you want.

683
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,840
Maybe.

685
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,400
lt was very nice meeting you, Jamal.

687
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,640
You, too, Claire.
Will you be around tomorrow?

689
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,800
Not where you´ll be, but...

691
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,360
...you might find me for lunch.

693
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,240
-I didn´t say those two words yesterday.
-Why not?

695
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,480
I want you to read more of my stuff.

697
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,720
They talk a lot about you out there.

699
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,480
All this legend bullshit.

701
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,960
They got some stories.
People wonder if you killed someone.

703
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,200
That, and wondering why
you been in here so long.

705
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,720
I wouldn´t move. lt´s quiet.
You don´t hear nothing in here.

707
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,320
Our place has noisy neighbours.

709
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,760
Their kid is always yelling,
´cause he´s a year old...

711
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,160
...or pops yells
´cause the kid is making noise.

713
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,680
Then mom, on top of that, is yelling.
But it´s a different kind of yelling, ´cause...

715
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,760
...the old man´s playing tunes for her and
she´s banging her head against the wall...

717
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,800
...and she´s screaming--

719
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,280
You better stir that soup.

721
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,320
What?

723
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,840
Stir the soup before it firms up.

725
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,960
Why doesn´t ours get anything on it?

727
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,680
Come on. Closer.

729
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,280
Now.

731
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,200
You got someone
doing that kind of yelling?

733
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,000
What I have is an adult male. Quite pretty.

735
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,800
Probably strayed from the park.

737
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,640
A Connecticut warbler.

739
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,680
You ever go outside to do any of this?

741
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,320
You should have stayed
with the soup question.

743
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,400
The object of a question is to obtain
information that matters only to us.

745
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,600
You were wondering
why your soup doesn´t firm up?

747
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,760
Probably because your mother
was brought up in a house...

749
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,160
...that never wasted milk in soup.

751
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,240
That question was a good one,
in contrast to, ´´Do I ever go outside?´´...

753
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,240
...which fails to meet the criteria of
obtaining information that matters to you.

755
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,520
All right. I guess I don´t have
any more soup questions.

757
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,160
No?

759
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,800
Why´d you say all that stuff
about me being black?

761
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,560
lt had nothing to do with you being black.

763
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,080
I wanted to find out
how much bullshit you´d put up with.

765
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,920
-So you knew l´d come back?
-Yes.

767
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,800
Just like I know
you´ll go to this new school.

769
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,760
How do you know?

771
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,240
Because there´s a question in your writing
about what you wish to do with your life.

773
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,600
That is a question your present school
cannot answer for you.

775
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,040
Let´s match up.
Wallace, you take Hartwell.

777
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,880
What´s up? l´m Jamal.

779
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,440
Just check it, all right?

781
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,840
Check the ball.

783
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,480
Come on.

785
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,880
Ball´s in.

787
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,760
Play him tough.

789
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,080
Way to go, gang.

791
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,200
D up. Let´s go, garbage.

793
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,960
Come on.

795
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,880
Step up.

797
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,080
Why don´t you leave
the trash-talking back home?

799
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,760
What? Get that goofy look off your face.

801
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,840
-l´m gonna make you my son right now.
-Right.

803
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,200
-You gonna be my son.
-Come on.

805
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,360
Let´s go.

807
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,680
-Come on, man.
-What?

809
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,440
You´re too small.

811
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,280
A little defence would be real nice.

813
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,880
Coach, you´re right. A little defence.

815
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,040
-Try to get past the line.
-What?

817
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,160
I said, get past the line.

819
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,320
Pressure.

821
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,160
Too much.

823
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,240
I need some help!

825
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,920
Ten seconds. Let´s go the other way.

827
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,120
-l´m taking your spot.
-What?

829
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,040
-l´m taking your spot.
-You take nothing.

831
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,440
Come on.

833
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,040
My court, babe. My court.

835
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,560
That´s how we play it down here.

837
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,160
That´s right.

839
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,760
John Hartwell´s just a rich kid
who wants as much of the spotlight...

841
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,160
...as he can get in his senior year.
That´s all it is.

843
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,920
-They take things real serious around here.
-lt´s a serious place.

845
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,360
Serious enough that I end up here
getting lunch on my books most days.

847
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,520
What´s that you´re working on?

849
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,880
Forrester´s book.

851
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,680
-You said you read it a dozen times.
-I know, but look at this.

853
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,760
My dad got it for me. lt´s an early printing.

855
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,360
-Listen, I got to go.
-But you just got here!

857
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,040
I know, but, I forgot something.
I got to check up on something.

859
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,960
l´lI see you later.

862
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,440
´´Born: 1930...

864
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,000
´´...in Scotland.´"

867
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,040
´´Moved to New York
with his family in his late teens.

869
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,040
´´Mr. Forrester was unavailable
for comment.´´

871
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,760
Yeah, I bet he was.

873
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,880
Are we now planning
to make these visits a habit?

875
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,560
You said you knew l´d come back.

877
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,000
Yes, but I thought you meant once.

879
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,840
I need some help with a thing at school.

881
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,120
Yes. This ´´thing´´ at school.

883
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,600
And what ´´thing´´
are we talking about now?

885
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,720
You ever read that?

887
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,680
l´m trying. I just can´t seem to get past
the first 10 pages.

889
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,440
As I recall...

891
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,760
...it took awhile
to get past those pages myself.

893
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,560
Christ, you´ve dog-eared one of them.
Show a little respect for the author.

895
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,920
That´s you, isn´t it?

897
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,680
You´re the author.

899
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,200
I read the whole thing. lt´s not bad.
Especially the part--

901
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,800
I know what it is.

903
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,280
The last thing I need is another person
telling me what they think it is.

905
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,720
I wasn´t going to say that.

907
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,480
What were you going to say?
I should tell you everything about me?

909
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,000
I told you about me.

911
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,280
You could learn a little something
about holding back.

913
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,960
If I ask you not to say anything
to anybody...

915
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,720
...about here, us...

917
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,360
...is that something I can trust you on?

919
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,160
Yeah.

921
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,280
I promise.

923
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,480
Fine.

925
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,280
And if I ask you to keep helping me
with my writing?

927
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,880
There´ll be no questions about me...

929
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,160
...my family,
or why there was only one book.

931
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,840
Then I won´t ask.

933
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,240
Good.

935
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,080
And good night.

937
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,800
What´s it feel like?

939
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,760
What?

941
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,200
Writing something the way you did.

943
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,640
Perhaps you´ll find out.

945
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,120
Listen, you 5-foot nothing....

947
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,480
That´s what l´m saying, though.

949
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,880
Kenzo, how old are you?

951
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,120
Why?

953
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,200
Look at your face!
Your mom didn´t do that to you?

955
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,120
She started you young.

957
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,280
Know where that comes from?
Eating too much cookie.

959
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,560
Teresa told me.

961
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,680
I like ´em big.
You got a problem with that?

963
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,480
-Nothing wrong with a big girl!
-That big?

965
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:47,800
lt don´t make a difference. lt´s like
when l´m with all three of your mothers.

967
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,320
-Not my mother.
-Yeah.

969
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,520
Hold on, Oscar Mayer wiener.

971
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:56,160
Stop playing, man. You got beat like Tina
in school one day. I seen Duke smack you.

973
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:00,400
Listen, throw it at your mama.
Every day, throw it towards your mama.

975
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,720
Your mama. Stop throwing your mama.

977
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,040
lt´s all in your tank, brother.

979
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,560
Why you laughing?

981
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,240
Man, your glasses are like Coke bottles.

983
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,800
Classics.

985
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,080
-You ever met somebody famous?
-How famous?

987
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,760
Like, I don´t know, like...

989
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,240
...somebody people would know.

991
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,040
Nobody like that comes around here, man.

993
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,720
Are you here for good now?

995
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,040
Yeah. l´m just trying to get started.

997
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,040
At least they look good, right?

999
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,960
You´ll all be pleased to know this year´s
writing competition has been scheduled.

1001
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,840
For those choosing to take part,
all entries must be turned in...

1003
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:05,240
...before spring break, which means you
have a few months of procrastination left.

1005
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,400
Feel free to experiment
with a more proactive approach.

1007
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,360
Mr. Wallace?

1009
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,080
Please.

1011
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,880
I had a chance to review the files
sent over by your former school.

1013
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,240
Test scores, impressive.

1015
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,960
Actual classroom work, not so impressive.

1017
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,520
ls this the level of work
I should anticipate?

1019
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,080
Because, if it is...

1021
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:46,800
...it will help me determine
whether to treat you as a student...

1023
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,520
...or as someone who is here to pursue,
how should I put it...

1025
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,120
...other endeavours?

1027
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,800
Of course, your work will give you
ample opportunity to respond.

1029
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,840
Good day, Mr. Wallace.

1031
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,640
Just so you know,
you handled that the right way.

1033
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,480
How is that?

1035
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,280
You didn´t say anything.
The ones who do run into trouble.

1037
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,560
-John Coleridge.
-Jamal Wallace.

1039
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,840
So, how many people do say something?

1041
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,880
And actually stay in Crawford´s class?
Not many.

1043
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,120
I missed what you said.

1045
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,960
I didn´t say anything.

1047
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,080
You read all these?

1049
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,200
No, I just keep them
to impress all my visitors.

1051
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,760
All your visitors.

1053
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,760
We´ve been talking
about your book at school.

1055
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:55,240
People have been talking about it for years.
They just haven´t been saying anything.

1057
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,960
I think I got it down, though.

1059
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,320
I figure you were writing about
how life never works out.

1061
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,440
Really? You had to read a book
to figure that out?

1063
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,720
But Crawford´s messed up on it anyhow.

1065
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,360
He says the guy having trouble
after the war is really you.

1067
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:16,360
Some symbolism shit for all the problems
you were having with everybody.

1069
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,880
Robert Crawford?

1071
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:23,240
Yeah. I think it´s bullshit, though.
I think there really was somebody else.

1073
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,240
Mr. Johannsen?

1075
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,800
Here.

1077
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,280
Mr. Massie.
Another trip to your favourite destination.

1079
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,680
l´ve got four bags.
I can just leave them if you like.

1081
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,880
No.

1083
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,160
Come right in.

1085
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,360
How you doing, Mr. Johannsen?

1087
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,760
lt´s at least a haIf hour before the sun sets.

1089
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,320
Then you can begin
your panic-driven quest back to Manhattan.

1091
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,960
This should last you till next week.

1093
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,040
Your mail is in this one.

1095
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,280
Mr. Johannsen?

1097
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,680
-The essentials are in--
-Essentials?

1099
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:08,200
I took care of your bills.
I put all the copies in this one.

1101
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,360
The phone company wants to know
if you want to continue service...

1103
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,240
...seeing as you haven´t had a call
in about--

1105
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,800
I got your socks for the next few weeks.
They´re in this one.

1107
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,280
I have your latest check from accounting.

1109
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:27,000
They want to know if you cashed
the last one. lt´s showing up outstanding.

1111
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,680
Not as outstanding as it once was.

1113
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,320
l´m sorry.
I didn´t realise you had company.

1115
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,920
We were just having a discussion on...

1117
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,640
...German automobile history.
Care to join us?

1119
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,440
-No, l´m in the tow-away.
-Of course you are.

1121
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,320
See you next week?

1123
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,080
Not if l´m lucky.

1125
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,880
Why don´t you give that guy a break
and do your own shopping?

1127
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,800
Why are your socks inside out?

1129
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,240
Socks are badly designed.

1131
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,280
The seams are on the inside.
They hurt the toes.

1133
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:11,160
In some cultures, it´s good luck
to wear something inside out.

1135
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,320
You believe that?

1137
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,200
No. But it´s like praying.
What do you risk?

1139
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:20,360
And I do go outside. How do you think
those windows get cleaned?

1141
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,880
Now, about this professor of yours.

1143
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,520
How did it feel having him tell you
what you can´t do?

1145
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,480
Like he knew he was better than me.

1147
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,000
Then let´s show him what you can do.

1149
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,720
Why is it the words we write
for ourselves...

1151
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:43,640
...are always so much better
than the words we write for others? Move.

1153
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,160
Sit.

1155
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,920
Go ahead.

1157
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,320
Go ahead and what?

1159
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,640
Write.

1161
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,120
What are you doing?

1163
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:09,800
l´m writing. Like you´ll be,
when you start punching those keys.

1165
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,640
ls there a problem?

1167
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,600
No. l´m just thinking.

1169
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,320
No thinking. That comes later.

1171
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,520
You write your first draft...

1173
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,000
...with your heart.

1175
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,240
You rewrite with your head.

1177
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,600
The first key to writing is...

1179
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,240
...to write.

1181
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,200
Not to think.

1183
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,440
Jesus.

1185
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,640
ls there a chance you might sit down?

1187
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,760
´´A Season of Faith´s Pefection.´"
What´s this?

1189
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,920
Start typing that.

1191
00:51:56,040 --> 00:52:00,040
Sometimes the simple rhythm of typing
gets us from page one to page two.

1193
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,200
When you begin to feel your own words,
start typing them.

1195
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,520
Punch the keys for God´s sake!

1197
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,480
Yes!

1199
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,560
You´re the man now, dog.

1204
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,200
Jamal?

1206
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,400
Whatever we write in this apartment...

1208
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,320
...stays in this apartment.

1210
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,680
No exceptions.

1212
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,440
Okay, let´s push it, guys.

1214
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,360
-That´s a foul.
-What do you mean? I had the spot.

1216
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,760
l´ll let you know when you got the spot.

1218
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:46,320
Gentlemen, our season begins in one week.
If I see this kind of thing one more time...

1220
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,080
...l´lI have you shooting fouls
to see who runs.

1222
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,240
ls that understood?

1224
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,560
One.

1226
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,760
Two.

1228
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,640
Three.

1230
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,480
Eleven.

1232
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,760
Twelve.

1234
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,160
Thirteen.

1236
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,640
Twenty-nine.

1238
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,240
Forty-eight.

1240
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,000
Forty-nine.

1242
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,120
Hold it.

1244
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,520
One more.

1246
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,440
That was one of the most
impressive things l´ve ever seen.

1248
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,200
Why do I know it wasn´t good enough
for either one of you?

1250
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,480
Shower up and get out of here.

1252
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,680
You may think we´re the same. We´re not.

1254
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,640
Mr. Wallace?

1256
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,000
Mr. Wallace.

1258
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,320
Professor.

1260
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,720
The latest paper you turned in...

1262
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,000
...displayed quite a bit of improvement
from your earlier work.

1264
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,800
-Thank you.
-Yes.

1266
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,840
How long did it take to write?

1268
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,280
I wrote it last night.

1270
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,800
Last night.

1272
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,480
Well, I have some things to finish up here.

1274
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,520
Good day, Mr. Wallace.

1276
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,080
That´s right. Select again.

1278
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,920
-´´Birds of a Feather´´ for $600.
-Answer..

1280
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,320
´´Vibrant in colour, its name borrows
from a Vivien Leigh character. ´´

1282
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,760
Scarlet tanager.

1284
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,160
No, it´s ´´What is the scarlet tanager?´"

1286
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,600
What is the scarlet tanager?

1288
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,000
See, you have to know the rules
to play the game.

1290
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,080
lt was written by a writer
you´ve never heard of.

1292
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:18,280
´´Thy duty, winged flame of spring

1294
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,720
´´is but to love and fly

1296
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:25,520
´´and sing´´ He was writing about
the song of the tanager.

1298
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,880
A song about new seasons, new life.

1300
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,120
That´s James Lowell, man.

1302
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,880
I know who he is.

1304
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,680
l´ll stay with ´´Poor Assumptions´"
for $800, Alex.

1306
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,720
Ever seen any scarlet tanagers
around here?

1308
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,400
They don´t stray that far from the park.

1310
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,560
So, your professor wasn´t exactly
full of praise this afternoon?

1312
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,760
Not exactly.

1314
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,960
There´s something you should know
about Robert Crawford.

1316
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,520
He wrote a book a few years after mine.

1318
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,800
All the publishers rejected it,
which was the right decision.

1320
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,920
lnstead of writing another one...

1322
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,880
...he took a job
teaching others how to write.

1324
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,640
How do you know all that?

1326
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,840
Just remember that bitterly
disappointed teachers...

1328
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,920
...can be either very effective...

1330
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,760
...or very dangerous.

1332
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,400
Okay, this is the first step tonight, guys.
Mailor on three.

1334
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,720
One, two, three, Mailor!

1336
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,080
Gold. Black.

1338
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,880
Straight and high, boys.

1340
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:06,720
What up, J?

1342
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,360
-You was in there tonight?
-26 points.

1344
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,480
8 out of 10 from the floor,
10 from 10 from the line.

1346
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:13,440
l´m supposed to miss that?

1348
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,880
lt was hot.

1350
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,760
You were putting some serious ink
on that stat page.

1352
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,480
What´s going on?

1354
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,880
Brothers are going to Red Rose.
I said we´d catch up.

1356
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,920
Friday night. Come on.

1358
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,680
Jamal, you plan on doing that every night?

1360
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,760
-Worked out, I guess.
-l´d say so.

1362
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,520
This is Fly.

1364
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,200
Hi. l´m Claire. You a friend of Jamal´s?

1366
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,120
Claire! Come on.

1368
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,840
l´m coming.

1370
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,520
Don´t hold up the bus too long.
Nice meeting you, Fly.

1372
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,120
What the hell you working there, man?

1374
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,000
Shut up, man.

1376
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,240
Yo, about Red Rose....

1378
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,480
I got to go to this dude´s house.
They do it every year.

1380
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,400
Don´t go off on this.

1382
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,680
You big time. Go on.
I don´t want to hold your bus up.

1384
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,160
Will you be around this weekend?

1386
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,880
Where do you think l´ll be? The Hamptons?

1388
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,840
Very nice talking with you.
Now, if you need anything...

1390
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,160
...please give me a call. Okay?

1392
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,440
Okay.

1394
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,120
Building up a collection of those things?

1396
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,800
Yeah, a few.

1398
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,480
Want to go outside for a while?

1400
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,680
Yeah. You know this place?

1402
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,720
I live in this place. Come on.

1404
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,680
They´ll be congratulating themselves
on your game till midnight.

1406
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:43,960
Which means l´lI have to cram tomorrow
for this test on Monday.

1408
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,600
Test on what?

1410
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,520
On the Sherlock Holmes books.

1412
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:50,400
They have us tracking down
all this worthless stuff like:

1414
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,760
Who introduced Watson to Holmes?

1416
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:56,320
They give it to you
´cause it forces you to read everything.

1418
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,440
Looks like it might be a while.

1420
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,960
Maybe so.

1422
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,320
So this friend, Fly,
how long have you known each other?

1424
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,640
A while. He was born there
and I was born there, too.

1426
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,480
-The Bronx?
-Yeah.

1428
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,480
Must be hard.

1430
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,760
What?

1432
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,400
New people, new school.

1434
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,720
lt´s not?

1436
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,400
No.

1438
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:24,880
What´s hard is growing up in a place
cops don´t even want to be in after dark.

1440
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,640
What´s hard is knowing you´re safe there.

1442
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:33,120
´Cause the people you need to worry about,
know you´ve got nothing to give them.

1444
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:36,480
So it´s a good thing you´re here.

1446
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,760
These people don´t think
I got anything to give them, either.

1448
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,080
Don´t let me get by you.
Once I get by you, l´ll score.

1450
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,840
Ready? Now stay in front of me, all right?

1452
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,400
All right?

1454
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,840
I got by you.

1456
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,200
You´re bigger than I am.

1458
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,960
lt doesn´t matter. You still got to defend.

1460
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,720
How do I do that?

1462
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:06,600
How do you play defence?
l´ll show you one way, here.

1464
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,760
Turn around.

1466
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,400
Feel that?

1468
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,840
I feel it.

1470
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:19,200
Now I know where you´ll go,
because I can feel you move.

1472
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,960
Try and move left.

1474
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,240
See, you can´t get around me.
I feel you moving left.

1476
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,600
Try and go right.

1478
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,600
l´m still here.

1480
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,960
I feel when you try to go right,
so you can´t go there, neither.

1482
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,920
Now try and get by me.

1484
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:41,720
Hold on.

1486
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,640
You have to dribble first.

1488
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,640
Dribble. Okay. Like....

1490
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,960
Like this?

1492
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,560
-Sorry.
-Claire.

1494
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,000
Daddy?

1496
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,920
Some of our guests are leaving.

1498
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,720
l´lI see you on Monday, okay?

1500
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,240
Claire?

1502
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,560
Yeah?

1504
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,440
lt was Stamford.

1506
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:22,560
Excuse me?

1508
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,000
At the bar in London.

1510
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,880
He was the one
who introduced Watson to Holmes.

1512
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,600
Might actually save you some time
after everyone´s done in there.

1514
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,840
You know how long
l´ve been working on that?

1516
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:44,400
lt ain´t one season of faith´s perfection.
Feels like I worked on it for two or three.

1518
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,080
You´re in that place
where you can´t even hear me.

1520
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:56,160
I could ask why you never left
this neighbourhood, and you wouldn´t--

1522
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,240
Paragraph three starts...

1524
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,360
...with a conjunction, ´´and.´"

1526
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,800
You should never start a sentence
with a conjunction.

1528
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,680
-Sure you can.
-No.

1530
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,160
lt´s a firm rule.

1532
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,360
No.

1534
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:13,880
lt was a firm rule. Sometimes using
a conjunction at the start of a sentence...

1536
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,240
...makes it stand out. And that may be
what the writer´s trying to do.

1538
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,160
And what is the risk?

1540
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,440
Doing it too much.

1542
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:26,400
lt´s a distraction
and could give your piece a run-on feeling.

1544
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,880
But the rule on using ´´and´´ or ´´but´´
at the start of a sentence is pretty shaky.

1546
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,560
Even though it´s still taught
by too many professors.

1548
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:38,600
Some of the best writers have ignored
that rule for years, including you.

1550
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,720
Well, you´ve taken something
which was mine...

1552
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:49,520
...and made it yours.
Quite an accomplishment.

1554
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,760
Thank you.

1556
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,160
The title´s still mine, isn´t it?

1558
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,480
I guess.

1560
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,960
lt was the neighbourhood that changed,
not me.

1562
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:04,800
I ain´t seen nothin´ changed.

1564
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,720
You ´´ain´t seen nothin´´´?
What in the hell kind of sentence is that?

1566
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,320
In here, don´t talk like you do out there.

1568
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,280
I was messin´ with you, man.
lt was a joke.

1570
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:24,400
Tell me about the neighbourhood back
when people were still reading your book.

1572
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,720
What did you say?

1574
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,720
Nothing.

1576
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:34,120
You said ´´back when people
were still reading my book.´´

1578
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,520
Didn´t you?

1580
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,520
We have 24 copies...

1582
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,200
...but l´m sorry, they are checked out.

1584
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,120
Thank you, anyway.

1586
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,000
Any luck?

1588
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,840
Did you get on the waiting list?

1590
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,960
Your book was checked out.

1592
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,640
And, yes...

1594
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,680
...I did pay for dinner.

1596
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:13,680
lt cost me $13, so you made your point.

1598
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:18,720
I tried to call to see what food you wanted,
but the phone kept ringing.

1600
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,120
I took the bell out 20 years ago.

1602
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,320
Let me ask you something.

1604
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,440
Why does a guy like you...

1606
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,520
...waste his time reading
National Enquirer?

1608
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,440
What´s wrong with it?

1610
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:39,360
lt´s trash, man.

1612
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:42,240
You should be reading
The Times or something.

1614
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,520
I read The Times for dinner...

1616
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,200
...but this is my dessert.

1618
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:51,160
They got some writing contest at school.

1620
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,760
-You ever enter one of those?
-A writing contest?

1622
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,400
-Yeah.
-Once.

1624
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,520
-A long time ago.
-Did you win?

1626
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,480
Well, of course I won.

1628
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,960
Like money or something?

1630
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,400
The Pulitzer.

1632
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,480
They make all the students
read in front of everyone.

1634
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,880
What the hell´s that got to do with writing?

1636
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:18,600
Writers write so that readers can read.
Let someone else read it.

1638
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,120
You ever read your own book?

1640
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,000
In public? Hell, no.

1642
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,720
I barely read it in private.

1644
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,960
You know those things they do,
that coffee shop reading shit?

1646
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:32,880
Do you know why they do it?

1648
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,040
To sell books, I guess.

1650
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:37,320
Because they want to get laid.

1652
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:40,320
Really? Women will sleep with you
if you write a book?

1654
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:43,320
They´ll sleep with you
if you write a bad book.

1656
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,120
-Did it ever happen to you?
-Sure.

1658
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,000
Did you ever get married?

1660
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:56,240
Not exactly a soup question, is it?

1662
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,840
No, I never did.

1664
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,320
But I learned a few things along the way...

1666
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:07,960
...which might help with this young lady
you always talk about.

1668
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,080
Like what?

1670
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,680
The key to a woman´s heart...

1672
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,840
...is an unexpected gift
at an unexpected time.

1674
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,560
You´re giving me advice on women?

1676
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,960
Unexpected gift, unexpected time.

1678
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,800
This is so unexpected.

1680
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,200
lt´s not a first printing or anything.

1682
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,400
Oh, my gosh.

1684
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,720
-What?
-This is a signed copy.

1686
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,640
I can´t accept this.
lt must have cost a fortune.

1688
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,040
lt didn´t cost that much, really.

1690
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,800
Maybe the bookstore missed it.

1692
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,600
Bookstores don´t usually miss this stuff.

1694
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:57,120
How´d you end up going to Mailor?

1696
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,920
Mailor was originally an all-boys´ school...

1698
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,400
...so, my father did
what anyone in his position would do.

1700
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,160
He got on the board and changed the rules.

1702
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:10,400
And every kid there knows it.

1704
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,480
They´d have done it anyway.

1706
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,080
That doesn´t change anything.
l´m still Dr. Spence´s daughter.

1708
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,280
That night at my home, after the game...

1710
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,640
...when you were showing me
how to play basketball:

1712
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,160
Was that all you were showing me?

1714
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,160
That´s not going to work.

1716
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:37,760
What?

1718
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,680
That.

1720
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,240
Why not?

1722
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:45,400
Ask your father.

1724
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,320
l´m not asking for some kind
of prenuptial agreement.

1726
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,800
lt´s just a question.

1728
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,440
Why must everything be
so black and white with you?

1730
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,440
I forgot the question.

1732
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,120
You don´t forget anything, Mr. Stamford.

1734
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:21,960
You don´t think he wrote it?
That´s a serious accusation, Robert.

1736
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,960
You come to the Faculty Board with this....

1738
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,280
l´m aware of how serious it is.

1740
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,280
lt´s remarkable work.

1742
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,200
You recognize any of it?

1744
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,200
lt smacks of something.

1746
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,840
But I don´t know.

1748
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:40,000
The boy does well in my class.
He had good scores coming in.

1750
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,200
Maybe he just needed direction.

1752
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:46,160
Carl, he´s a basketball player
from the Bronx.

1754
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,160
Who happens to have won 17 straight...

1756
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,400
...for a school that likes winning.

1758
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,760
Have you considered
he might just be that good?

1760
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,560
Not this good.

1762
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,280
Do you know
what the absolute best moment is?

1764
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,880
When you´ve finished your first draft...

1766
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,880
...and you read it by yourself.

1768
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,000
Before these arseholes...

1770
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,480
...take something
they couldn´t do in a lifetime...

1772
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,680
...and tear it down in a single day.

1774
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,640
People love that book, man.

1776
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,040
I didn´t write it for them.

1778
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:21,560
And when the critics
started all this bullshit about...

1780
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:25,400
...what it was I was really trying to say...

1782
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,000
...well, I decided then...

1784
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:32,240
...one book was enough.

1786
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,120
William, that was 50 years ago, man.

1789
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:43,040
I actually spent money on these tickets.
Come on.

1791
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:45,240
ls it still light outside?

1793
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:46,920
lt´s nighttime.

1795
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,120
Well?

1797
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:59,640
You look good. lt´s not the latest stuff--

1799
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,800
I wasn´t asking how I look.

1801
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:05,360
-I was asking, are we ready to go?
-Yeah. Come on, man.

1803
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:08,760
Let´s go.

1805
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,440
Come on.

1807
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,680
We play here in two weeks.

1809
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:32,120
I said, we play here in two weeks.
State tournament.

1811
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:52,400
Hold on. Let me get a programme.

1813
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:27,320
Damn.

1815
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:41,600
Let´s get you out of here.

1817
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:44,800
I got you.

1819
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,760
You used to get out, right?

1821
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,400
Yeah, a long time ago.

1823
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,320
-What happened?
-How should I know?

1825
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,680
I didn´t keep track of the time.

1827
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:24,080
Sorry for losing you back there.

1829
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,080
No apology needed.

1831
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:28,680
Good. l´ve got one more place.
lt´s quiet and on the way home.

1833
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,320
You only got 10 minutes.

1835
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,760
All right.

1837
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,240
Take that.

1839
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,160
Ground level.

1841
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,200
´´The house that Ruth built.´"

1843
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,200
Why did you bring me here?

1845
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:10,640
Because it´s your birthday.

1847
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,600
I looked it up in the almanac.

1849
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,960
You´re not in the dead people section yet.

1851
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,160
I figure with all the games you watched...

1853
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:29,400
...with whoever you watched them with...

1855
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,520
...you probably never got this close.

1857
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,880
What are they doing on the dirt?

1859
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:38,280
Who cares? You acting like
they´re going to play a World Series game.

1861
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:40,520
Relax.

1863
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:43,600
My brother and I,
we were here for every game.

1865
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,960
Till he left for the war.

1867
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:54,400
I thought it´d be the same
when he came back, but...

1869
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:57,760
...he talked a little less...

1871
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,560
...and drank a little more.

1873
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:04,680
I promised my mother
I would help him get through it all.

1875
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,440
I caught up with him this one night.

1877
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,520
I was already haIf a dozen drinks behind.

1879
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,120
So we had a few more...

1881
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:22,560
...and after a while,
he tells me he wants to...

1883
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,800
...drive me back to the apartment.

1885
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:28,200
I said ´´No, thanks.´"

1887
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:32,640
We were all still living there, then.

1889
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,480
I just stood there and...

1891
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,840
...watched him drive off.

1893
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,400
He makes it through
the whole goddamn war...

1895
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:49,360
...and I let him drive.

1897
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:55,360
Later that night, the nurse was typing...

1899
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,760
...whatever it is they type...

1901
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,800
...and you know what she tells me?

1903
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:06,040
She tells me how much
my book meant to her.

1905
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:10,480
My brother is getting cold
in the next room...

1907
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,520
...and all she can talk about is a book.

1910
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,200
Within five months, I buried...

1912
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,360
...him, my ma, my father.

1914
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,400
All of them here in the Bronx.

1916
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,000
We´d spend our summers here.

1918
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,440
And if we were lucky, the fall.

1920
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,360
A lot of falls with those teams.

1922
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,000
Yeah, well...

1924
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,920
...not enough.

1926
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:54,640
´´The rest of those
who have gone before us...

1928
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,760
´´...cannot steady the unrest of those...

1930
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,160
´´...to follow.´"

1932
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:04,440
You wrote that in your book.

1934
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:34,120
I realise that if I give you enough time
you´ll find a way...

1936
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,240
...to amaze even me.

1938
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:41,280
Does he know?

1940
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:43,960
No, he doesn´t know.

1942
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,600
This was one of the best evenings l´ve had
in quite some time.

1944
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:50,760
All of it?

1946
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,440
Yes.

1948
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:54,080
All of it.

1950
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:55,600
Well, I....

1952
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,720
This guy....

1954
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,680
How do you say you know this guy again?

1956
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,000
-He´s my teacher.
-Yeah?

1958
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,320
Seemed like a different kind of dude.

1960
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,800
Anyone in particular?

1962
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:28,800
I sometimes come here in the morning.

1964
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,640
Just me, the aspiring...

1966
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,800
...and all of them.

1968
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:41,760
There was a note downstairs
saying I should come to see you.

1970
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,680
Mr. Wallace...

1972
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:49,440
...I think it´s time you and I had an honest
and open discussion about your writing.

1974
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,080
I thought you liked it.

1976
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,840
Your recent work?

1978
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,400
I liked it very much.

1980
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:02,080
No, the question concerning
your most recent work...

1982
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,920
...isn´t whether it´s good...

1984
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:09,320
...it´s whether it´s too good.

1986
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:15,200
The acceleration in your progress from
your old school to this one is unusual...

1988
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:19,520
...to the point that I must draw
one of two conclusions:

1990
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:25,920
Either you´ve been blessed with
an uncommon gift, which has kicked in...

1992
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:28,600
...or...

1994
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:33,200
...you´re getting your inspiration
from elsewhere.

1996
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:37,600
Given your previous education
and your background...

1998
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:41,400
...l´m sure you´ll forgive me
for coming to my own conclusions.

2000
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,520
I wrote those papers.

2002
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:45,840
Then you won´t mind showing me.

2004
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:49,280
The next assignment´s due in two weeks.

2006
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:52,520
l´ll schedule some time for you
to come to my office.

2008
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:56,600
l´d like to have you write it there.

2010
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:02,520
In the meantime, if there´s anything
you wish to talk about....

2012
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:06,720
l´m not writing anything.

2014
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:08,960
Which proves what?

2016
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:13,280
If a two-comma kid wrote these papers,
he´d say, ´´Considering your background´´?

2018
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,200
-Two-comma kid?
-$1,000,000.

2020
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,160
One comma, two commas.

2022
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,160
No, I don´t.

2024
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,840
Do you know what
people are most afraid of?

2026
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:25,760
-What?
-What they don´t understand.

2028
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:29,000
When we don´t understand,
we turn to our assumptions.

2030
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,960
Crawford cannot understand...

2032
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:36,320
...how a black kid from the Bronx
can write the way you do.

2034
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,360
So he assumes you can´t.

2036
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:42,640
Just like I assume he´s an asshole.

2038
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,960
You knew him, didn´t you?

2040
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,560
Crawford? No.

2042
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,720
But he thought he knew me.

2044
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:53,080
So what was that about his book?

2046
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:56,160
A lot of writers
know the rules about writing...

2048
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,400
...but they don´t know how to write.

2050
01:28:58,400 --> 01:28:59,360
So?

2052
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:02,760
So Crawford wrote a book
about four authors who did know.

2054
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:06,000
I was the only one still alive.

2056
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:09,520
He convinced a publisher to buy it.

2058
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:13,760
I made a polite telephone call...

2060
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:17,200
...to this publisher, telling him and others...

2062
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,960
...I was in the process
of writing a second book...

2064
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:25,240
-...and if they wanted to bid on it--
-So that´s why Crawford´s book went away.

2066
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:29,600
But you knew
there wouldn´t be a second book.

2068
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,560
Yeah, but they didn´t.

2070
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:41,480
lnteresting what happens
when the resources aren´t close at hand.

2073
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:23,880
The tradition of handing in composition
entries on the final day continues...

2075
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:27,360
...for yet...

2077
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:29,400
...another year.

2079
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,400
Ladies and gentlemen...

2081
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:39,040
...may I have your attention?

2083
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:41,320
Please, if you don´t mind.

2085
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:45,440
´´Ere sin could blight or sorrow fade

2087
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,760
´´Death came with friendly care

2089
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:50,440
´´The opening bud to heaven convey´d´"

2091
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:52,880
How nice of you to join us.

2093
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,800
That´s not part of the poem.

2095
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:59,040
´´And bade it blossom there´´ Anyone?

2097
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:05,320
A little more early morning reticence
than usual.

2099
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:07,720
Mr. Coleridge.

2101
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,760
Please.

2103
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:17,240
How many students
would you say are here today?

2105
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:21,120
l´m not sure.

2107
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:24,160
Perhaps you could humour us with a guess.

2109
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:27,600
Thirty?

2111
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:31,360
And of that 30, not one person knows
the author of that passage.

2113
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,440
I find that remarkable, don´t you?

2115
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,680
Perhaps we should back into this.

2117
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:44,600
In looking at this, what, if any conclusions,
might we be able to draw?

2119
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,520
You mean about the author?

2121
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,480
About anything.

2123
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:54,920
Do any of the words strike you as unusual?

2125
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:02,480
Feel free to view this
as the appropriate time for a response.

2127
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:06,520
´´Ere.´"

2129
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,600
And why is that unusual?

2131
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,360
Because it sounds old.

2133
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:16,520
lt does sound old, doesn´t it?

2135
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:18,920
Do you know why it sounds old?

2137
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:23,360
Because it is old. More than 200 years old.

2139
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:27,040
Written before your father was born,
before his father was born.

2141
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:29,120
But...

2143
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,520
...that still does not excuse the fact
that you...

2145
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:34,240
...don´t know who wrote it, now, does it?

2147
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,960
l´m sorry, sir, I don´t....

2149
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:42,720
You, of all people here,
should know who wrote that passage.

2151
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:46,000
And do you know why, Mr. Coleridge?

2153
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,520
I repeat, do you know why?

2155
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,320
Just say your name, man.

2157
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:55,680
Excuse me.
Did you have something to contribute?

2159
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,800
I just said that he should say his name.

2161
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:04,400
And why would it be helpful
for Mr. Coleridge to say his name?

2163
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:07,320
Because that´s who wrote it.

2165
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,520
Very good, Mr. Wallace.

2167
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:14,880
Perhaps your skills do extend
a bit farther than basketball.

2169
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:20,560
If we can turn to page--
You may be seated, Mr. Coleridge.

2171
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:24,440
Turn to page 120
in the little blue book that--

2173
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:26,680
Further.

2175
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:29,640
l´m sorry?

2177
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:31,400
Don´t.

2179
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:37,120
You said my skills extend ´´farther´"
than the basketball court.

2181
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:39,640
´´Farther´´ relates to distance.

2183
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:42,280
´´Further´´ is a definition of degree.

2185
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:44,480
You should have said ´´further.´"

2187
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:46,480
Are you challenging me?

2189
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:49,760
No more than you challenged Coleridge.

2191
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:53,200
Perhaps the challenge
should have been directed elsewhere.

2193
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,440
´´It is a melancholy truth that even--

2195
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:59,840
´´Great men have poor relations´"

2197
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,240
Dickens.

2199
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:06,000
-´´You will hear the beat of--´"
-Kipling.

2201
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:09,600
-´´All great truths begin--´"
-Shaw.

2203
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:12,760
-´´Man is the only animal--
-´´That blushes

2205
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,440
´´or needs to´"

2207
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:19,600
Mark Twain.

2209
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,360
-Come on, Professor--
-Get out!

2211
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,160
Get...

2213
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,640
...out.

2215
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:35,280
Yeah. l´ll get out.

2217
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:50,240
-Leave it alone, Claire.
-Hold on, please.

2219
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:53,120
So around here,
they kick you out if you know something?

2221
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,040
You have no idea what Crawford could do.

2223
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,080
You´re right about that.

2225
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:04,000
-Do you think you should apologise?
-No.

2227
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:06,760
-Do you?
-No.

2229
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:10,920
You did nothing wrong.
You just beat him at his own game.

2231
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,680
But...

2233
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:16,000
...it would be a good time to be careful.

2235
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:18,000
Careful about what?

2237
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:23,440
You have a gift that should allow you
to do remarkable things in life.

2239
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:26,240
That is, if you don´t screw it up...

2241
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:28,760
...by being a 16-year-old right now.

2243
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:42,000
You got a call from the office.

2245
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,680
Mr. Wallace, please.

2247
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:54,560
As you know...

2249
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:59,080
...Professor Matthews is on Faculty Board.
Dr. Spence is chair of the Trustees Board.

2251
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:02,760
We´ve been reviewing the writing
competition submissions.

2253
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:07,680
We were hoping you might clarify
some points concerning your submission.

2255
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:10,760
A Season of Faith´s Pefection.

2257
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,680
Your piece, correct?

2259
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:17,400
Yeah, that´s it.

2261
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:22,040
It is standard policy to ask students
if they wish to credit any source material...

2263
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:27,120
...or acknowledge any other writers
when turning in an assignment.

2265
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,600
Do you wish to do that?

2267
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,120
1960.

2269
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,840
An essay titled Baseball´s Best Year...

2271
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,280
...with a subtitle that reads:

2273
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,680
A Season of Faith´s Pefection.

2275
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:52,680
Published in the New Yorker
and written by...

2277
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:55,040
...William Forrester.

2279
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:01,280
Your version is quite original, but...

2281
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:04,560
...there is the title
and first paragraph to consider.

2283
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:07,640
lsn´t there?

2285
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:13,880
Either you happen to have
William Forrester´s permission...

2287
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,680
...or....

2289
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:18,520
Have you some other explanation?

2291
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:19,760
No.

2293
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,640
That´s my paper.

2295
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:28,640
Then your entry is now withdrawn and
this is a matter for the board to consider.

2297
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:33,080
The board does have the authority
to place you on academic probation...

2299
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:38,120
...which would prevent you
from playing basketball in the future.

2301
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,400
Since the board doesn´t meet
till next week...

2303
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:48,800
...you can play in this weekend´s
state championship.

2305
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:52,080
But the board has a history
of taking these matters...

2307
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,440
...quite seriously.

2309
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,040
So we would like to suggest
what we feel is a...

2311
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:02,200
...solution that may satisfy these concerns.

2313
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:05,040
Robert.

2315
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:09,480
What matters most is to ensure
this type of violation isn´t repeated.

2317
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:11,200
So...

2319
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:15,840
...you will be required to write an apology
to the students you took advantage of...

2321
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:18,440
...by submitting this piece...

2323
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:21,440
...and you will read it in front of my class.

2325
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:22,880
l´m not reading anything.

2327
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:27,080
The board will consider that when deciding
whether to renew your scholarship.

2329
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:30,440
You haven´t left us with too many options.

2331
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,520
Excuse me.

2333
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:49,800
Don´t ever embarrass me
in front of my class.

2335
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:57,080
Return the pen when you´re finished.

2337
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:07,000
No conventional greetings today?

2339
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:10,400
Why have me rewrite something
you published?

2341
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:11,360
Be careful.

2343
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:13,760
Why didn´t you tell me
some magazine ran it?

2345
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:15,680
Why the hell should it matter?

2347
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:17,720
You should have told me.

2349
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:20,960
What did you do with it?

2351
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,640
I turned it in.

2353
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:26,280
I turned it in.
I had to show them something.

2355
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:30,280
You promised me anything we wrote
in here would stay in here.

2357
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:32,400
I know!

2359
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:38,040
-I just thought--
-Shut up.

2361
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,640
What are they telling you?

2363
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:50,720
I go on probation unless I write a letter
saying I was wrong.

2365
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:52,640
Then write the letter.

2367
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:54,560
l´m not writing anything.

2369
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:57,360
You got him, he gets you. Write the letter.

2371
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:01,000
And you´d let him do that?

2373
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:05,320
ls this supposed to be another lesson?

2375
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:08,920
l´m tired of all these lessons.
Every time I come here.

2377
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:15,200
The title of your essay is at the top
of my paper. What´s the lesson in that?

2379
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:16,640
l´m not the one who turned it in.

2381
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:19,520
You talked all that trash
when all you had to say was:

2383
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:23,160
´´Keep this one here
´cause it got printed in the New Yorker.´"

2385
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,960
That´s all you had to say.

2387
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:29,120
I could use a little help.

2389
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:31,200
No, that´s not an option.

2391
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,480
-You don´t even have to go--
-I said, that´s not an option.

2393
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,360
Sorry, man.

2395
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:39,680
l´m used to people not helping me.

2397
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:42,680
Oh, Christ.
Not that self-pity father bullshit.

2399
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:46,240
What did you say?

2401
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:53,200
Man, fuck you, William!

2403
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:56,480
The real bullshit
is you letting me take it on this one...

2405
01:40:56,480 --> 01:41:00,760
...´cause you´re scared to walk out the door
and do something for someone else.

2407
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:05,400
That´s the only damn reason.

2409
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:08,960
You don´t know a damn thing
about reasons.

2411
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:10,880
There are no reasons!

2413
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:13,960
Reasons why some of us live
and some of us don´t.

2415
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:17,120
Fortunately for you,
you´ve decades to figure that out.

2417
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:21,360
What´s the reason for having a locked
cabinet of writing no one can ever read?

2419
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:25,160
What is that, man?

2421
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:29,720
l´m done with this shit.

2423
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:40,840
Look, Jamal is here to pay us a visit.

2425
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:46,920
What´s up?

2427
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:49,760
What´s up, y´all?

2429
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:51,160
Come on.

2431
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:20,960
How does your first game
in the Garden feel?

2433
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:24,720
A little closer than I thought.

2435
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:28,800
That´s why I thought
it might be a good time for us to talk.

2437
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:33,600
I know it´s been hard handling classes with
the time you have to spend on the court.

2439
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:36,640
I couldn´t handle it, not at this school.

2441
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:40,240
Maybe it was unfair of us
to ask you to do it.

2443
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:44,160
I talked to the board members
and to Crawford...

2445
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:46,400
...and...

2447
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:50,120
...we don´t want to pursue this
any more than you do.

2449
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:54,120
So, l´m here to present you with an offer.
We forget the whole thing.

2451
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:58,400
Next year, your academic schedule
will be less demanding.

2453
01:42:58,400 --> 01:42:59,840
Crawford wanted that?

2455
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:02,400
Crawford wants what´s best for you...

2457
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:04,640
...and for the school.

2459
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:06,560
What am I supposed to do?

2461
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:09,920
You hold up a championship trophy
at the end of this tournament.

2463
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:12,960
You make that happen,
l´ll make the rest happen.

2465
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:15,680
All right?

2467
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:18,280
Now, go finish up what you came to do.

2469
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:26,640
Let´s go, Pilgrims!

2471
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:30,240
Let´s go! Throw to Jamal!

2473
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:59,760
Damn, man. Come on.

2475
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:02,200
Defence!

2477
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:16,600
Jamal, get the ball!

2479
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:35,600
Good pass, man.

2481
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:45,040
Pick it up.

2483
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:57,600
Offensive foul! That way!

2485
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:00,200
10, Gold. Offensive! That way.

2487
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:03,440
You got them now. Let´s go.

2489
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:17,120
Time-out.

2491
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:22,600
This is still our game. We stop here,
they´lI have to put us on the line.

2493
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:26,880
When that happens, it´s all over.
Don´t lose your composure.

2495
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:31,920
If they score, we don´t call a time-out.
The ball goes to Hartwell or Wallace.

2497
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:35,480
Okay? Hartwell or Wallace. Let´s go.

2499
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:38,480
Go!

2501
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:53,920
What´s the score?

2503
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:56,200
lt ain´t looking good, Ma.

2505
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:09,640
Foul. 22, Blue. Two shots.

2507
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:16,320
Foul, Blue team, 22.
Hit, two. Go line up, guys.

2509
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,280
Two shots.

2511
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:31,520
We´re going to make these.

2513
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:34,400
-I can´t look.
-lt´s gonna be all right, Ma.

2515
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:45,800
Do it.

2517
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:54,880
Damn.

2519
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:02,240
One shot.

2521
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:30,200
That´s game.

2523
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:17,080
Thank God.
He must have come in after we left.

2525
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:19,400
Let him sleep.

2527
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:22,560
-l´ll turn the light off.
-Turn it off and come on.

2529
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,720
You started cleaning up your room, Jamal.

2532
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:49,240
He looks very happy with himself,
that coyote.

2534
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:09,160
Jamal, he wrote that for you.

2536
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:12,040
When?

2538
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:13,880
After the game.

2540
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:16,920
He´s going back to the school this morning.

2542
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:19,400
lt´s funny, though.

2544
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:21,960
They always let you get but so far...

2546
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:25,040
...before taking everything away from you.

2548
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:29,600
God, he´s such a good kid, man.
Then he gets to come back to this shit.

2551
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:11,600
ls that seat open?

2553
01:52:13,640 --> 01:52:15,160
I think so.

2555
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:19,200
This isn´t where I thought l´d find you.

2557
01:52:21,320 --> 01:52:23,240
lt´s still my school.

2559
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:27,360
They want me out,
they´lI have to do it themselves.

2561
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:29,040
They will.

2563
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:31,400
Whatever.

2565
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:48,120
´´The winter´s darkness and cold is but
a momentary prelude to the new spring.

2567
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:52,560
´´And while its grip seems endless
our own perseverance proves equal.

2569
01:52:53,480 --> 01:52:54,920
´´We renew ourselves once again...

2571
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:58,200
´´...seeking out the bright moments
that will serve...

2573
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:01,200
´´...that will serve therefore....

2575
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:06,280
´´Therefore serve
as the foundation of our future.´"

2577
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:09,360
Thank you.

2579
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:20,760
Professor Crawford.

2581
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:25,720
May I read a few words?

2583
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:32,880
What is he doing here?

2585
01:53:34,280 --> 01:53:36,520
Yes, of course, by all means.

2587
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:41,480
Thank you, Professor.

2589
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:57,160
My name is William Forrester.

2591
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:05,040
Excuse me.

2593
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:11,880
l´m that one.

2595
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:17,680
Losing Family.

2597
01:54:19,400 --> 01:54:22,360
´´Losing family obliges us
to find our family.

2599
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:28,000
´´Not always the family that is our blood...

2601
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:31,000
´´...but the family
that can become our blood.

2603
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:35,640
´´Should we have the wisdom
to open our door to this new family...

2605
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:40,920
´´...we will find that the wishes we had
for the father, who once guided us...

2607
01:54:42,440 --> 01:54:45,360
´´...for the brother, who once inspired us....

2609
01:55:20,360 --> 01:55:22,920
´´The only thing left to say will be:

2611
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:27,160
´´´I wish I had seen this,
or I wish I had done that, or I wish....´´"

2613
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:32,640
Most of you are too young...

2615
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:36,320
...to know what your wishes will be.

2617
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:38,960
But when I read these words...

2619
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:42,200
...words of hope, dreams...

2621
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:46,560
...I realise that the one...

2623
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:49,880
...wish that was granted to me,
so late in life...

2625
01:55:51,080 --> 01:55:53,360
...was the gift of friendship.

2627
01:55:56,840 --> 01:56:01,360
Mr. Forrester, l´m sure I speak on behalf
of everyone in thanking you for this visit.

2629
01:56:03,560 --> 01:56:05,000
The quality...

2631
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,840
...of your words...

2633
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:10,360
...is something we should
all aspire to reach.

2635
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:19,200
May I ask to what do we owe this honour?

2637
01:56:20,840 --> 01:56:22,760
Professor Crawford...

2639
01:56:23,720 --> 01:56:27,440
...I spoke here today
because a friend of mine wasn´t allowed to.

2641
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:32,000
A friend who had
the integrity to protect me...

2643
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:35,480
...when I was unwilling to protect him.

2645
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:39,280
His name is Jamal Wallace.

2647
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:47,240
Jamal Wallace is a friend of yours?

2649
01:56:47,240 --> 01:56:48,760
Yes, he is.

2651
01:56:51,080 --> 01:56:54,680
I helped him find his own words
by starting with some of mine.

2653
01:56:55,880 --> 01:56:57,960
In return, he promised...

2655
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:01,680
...never to say anything about me.

2657
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:06,080
A promise which he kept.

2659
01:57:08,360 --> 01:57:12,080
While your visit seems heartfelt,
l´m sure you will appreciate...

2661
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:15,240
...it will not change or interfere...

2663
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:20,120
...with this institution reaching a fair
and proper decision in this case.

2665
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:22,560
There´s one more issue here.

2667
01:57:24,680 --> 01:57:27,040
Those words that I read today...

2669
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,920
...I didn´t write them.

2671
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:32,720
Jamal Wallace did.

2673
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:43,760
Quiet.

2675
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:48,400
Quiet, please.

2677
01:57:49,160 --> 01:57:50,600
Be still.

2679
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,640
Quiet, please.

2681
01:57:55,400 --> 01:57:57,360
That has no bearing...

2683
01:57:57,800 --> 01:58:00,200
...on the decision concerning Mr.--

2685
01:58:00,200 --> 01:58:03,560
As director of this competition,
I have final say in this matter.

2687
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:05,320
Robert, sit down.

2689
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:08,400
I have been a teacher
for more than 30 years.

2691
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:12,480
That´s long enough to know
that integrity counts for something.

2693
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:15,520
l´d say that Mr. Forrester has cleared up...

2695
01:58:16,040 --> 01:58:17,480
...this matter...

2697
01:58:17,480 --> 01:58:21,400
...very nicely for us all.
As chairman of the Faculty Board, I have...

2699
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:24,160
...the last word in that matter.

2701
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:27,560
You are excused
from next week´s board meeting.

2703
01:58:27,560 --> 01:58:29,280
Mr. Forrester...

2705
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:33,920
...should you ever be interested
in a teaching position....

2707
01:58:34,280 --> 01:58:35,480
No.

2709
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:39,840
Jamal, these are your words?

2711
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:44,320
Sixteen.

2713
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:47,320
Remarkable.

2715
01:59:13,640 --> 01:59:17,040
l´m thinking you´ll make
your own decisions from here on.

2717
01:59:18,440 --> 01:59:21,760
I thought you´d say something like,
´´l always could.´´

2719
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:25,120
No more lessons.
I have a question, though.

2721
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:29,560
Those two foul shots
at the end of the game...

2723
01:59:30,440 --> 01:59:33,200
...did you miss them or did you miss them?

2725
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:37,240
Not exactly a soup question, is it?

2727
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:40,520
Let´s go.

2729
01:59:42,920 --> 01:59:46,880
Do you think our vaudeville act today
will merit the National Enquirer?

2731
01:59:47,240 --> 01:59:48,760
Definitely.

2733
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:52,720
Whatever happens, l´m off.

2735
01:59:54,920 --> 01:59:58,280
What´s the word
you and your friends would use for that?

2737
01:59:58,760 --> 02:00:00,160
Leaving?

2739
02:00:00,680 --> 02:00:02,080
Oh, God.

2741
02:00:02,600 --> 02:00:04,040
Where are you off to?

2743
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:07,000
I have a homeland
I haven´t seen for too long.

2745
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:09,160
You mean lreland.

2747
02:00:09,320 --> 02:00:11,240
Scotland, for God´s sake.

2749
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:13,360
l´m messin´ with you, man.

2751
02:00:15,080 --> 02:00:16,840
Be sure to write.

2754
02:00:52,040 --> 02:00:53,480
What´s up, John?

2756
02:00:53,480 --> 02:00:55,400
You heard from William?

2758
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:59,880
Yeah, but I don´t know what he´s doing.
He just checks up on the college recruiters.

2760
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:04,040
I was just downstairs.
Looks like you got another one.

2762
02:01:04,040 --> 02:01:05,320
Word?

2764
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:07,640
See you around.

2766
02:01:14,120 --> 02:01:16,720
-Steve Sanderson.
-How are you doing?

2768
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,920
Thanks for coming down on short notice.

2770
02:01:18,920 --> 02:01:20,440
No problem.

2772
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:22,280
What school are you from?

2774
02:01:22,280 --> 02:01:25,280
No. l´m a lawyer.
I work with Roberts & Carter.

2776
02:01:27,080 --> 02:01:28,040
-A lawyer.
-Yeah.

2778
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:30,880
But congratulations on all that. lt´s great.

2780
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:35,880
A bunch of guys in the office
are following you.

2782
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:40,880
We´re the legal representation
for William Forrester.

2784
02:01:42,440 --> 02:01:43,920
How is he?

2786
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:46,280
Sit down.

2788
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:55,440
We´ve received word
that William passed away.

2790
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:07,920
l´m sorry.

2792
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:16,160
He wanted you to have...

2794
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:18,680
...these things right away.

2796
02:02:33,320 --> 02:02:34,960
What happened?

2798
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:38,040
William had cancer.

2800
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:42,560
They found it a couple of years ago.

2802
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,920
Jamal, this is crazy.

2804
02:02:55,400 --> 02:02:56,920
Oh, my God.

2806
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:03,200
Look at all these books.

2808
02:03:03,560 --> 02:03:05,480
Don´t touch anything.

2810
02:04:20,840 --> 02:04:22,280
Dear Jamal..

2812
02:04:22,280 --> 02:04:25,640
Someone I once knew wrote
that we walk away from our dreams...

2814
02:04:25,640 --> 02:04:29,320
...afraid that we may fail, or worse yet,
afraid we may succeed.

2816
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:34,720
While I knew so very early on
that you would realise your dreams...

2818
02:04:35,240 --> 02:04:38,520
...I never imagined
I would once again realise my own.

2820
02:04:40,040 --> 02:04:41,480
Seasons change, young man.

2822
02:04:41,480 --> 02:04:45,880
While I waited until the winter of my life
to see what I´ve seen this past year...

2824
02:04:47,240 --> 02:04:51,360
...there is no doubt I would have
waited too long, had it not been for you.

2826
02:05:01,160 --> 02:05:03,440
You gonna be here awhile, man?

2828
02:05:06,920 --> 02:05:08,840
Just can´t watch the eyes this time.

2830
02:05:08,840 --> 02:05:11,080
You´ll be okay, man. Come on.

2832
02:05:14,120 --> 02:05:15,720
Come on, man.

2834
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:17,880
Get up.
