1
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:29,711
Here's another geography
question for $1000.

2
00:00:29,746 --> 00:00:32,892
What mountain range separates
Casablanca from Sahara desert?

3
00:00:32,927 --> 00:00:35,674
Is it A, the Himalayas,
B, the Atlas mountains,

4
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:39,262
C, the Pyrenees or
D, the Aberdare mountains?

5
00:00:40,303 --> 00:00:42,592
- Doesn't prove anything.
- It proves everything, and you know it.

6
00:00:42,627 --> 00:00:47,029
- Do you want to see it again?
- No, thanks. I hate watching myself on TV.

7
00:00:47,064 --> 00:00:49,223
Roddy, why did you do it?

8
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:50,855
Have you ever been in debt, Lizzie?

9
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,324
And I mean real debt.
It changes everything.

10
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:56,111
- That's no excuse.
- What are you doing?

11
00:00:56,146 --> 00:00:58,826
- The right thing.
- Look, Lizzie,

12
00:00:58,861 --> 00:01:01,660
if this is your way of asking
for a raise, it worked.

13
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:03,548
Hey, how much do you want?

14
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,459
I don't want money, Roddy.
I'm not you.

15
00:01:05,494 --> 00:01:07,501
All right, you don't want money.
What do you want?

16
00:01:07,536 --> 00:01:08,957
I want to be able to sleep at night.

17
00:01:08,992 --> 00:01:12,073
I want to be able to be proud
of the show the way I used to be.

18
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:19,318
What are you going to do, slip it under
the producer's door anonymously?

19
00:01:19,353 --> 00:01:22,190
Didn't even have the courage
to write your own name on it.

20
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,882
Aw, Lizzie, all right,
look, I'm sorry.

21
00:01:25,917 --> 00:01:28,947
- Hey, it'll never happen again.
- Damn right it won't.

22
00:01:28,982 --> 00:01:32,163
Okay, okay.
Look, you win.

23
00:01:33,034 --> 00:01:34,982
I'll quit the show.

24
00:01:35,017 --> 00:01:37,486
But just give me one day.

25
00:01:37,521 --> 00:01:39,312
Let me do it on my own,

26
00:01:39,347 --> 00:01:42,314
so I can do it with whatever's
left of my dignity.

27
00:01:43,607 --> 00:01:46,373
- If this is a trick, I don't...
- it's not a trick. It's not a trick.

28
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:48,832
I swear to you.
Watch, watch tonight.

29
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:51,541
Before the bonus round,
I'll make an announcement.

30
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,604
God help me.

31
00:01:56,956 --> 00:01:58,762
Okay.

32
00:01:59,724 --> 00:02:01,219
Okay.

33
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:13,300
How about another drink
before I walk the plank?

34
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,731
Sure.

35
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,746
Thank you. Welcome back to
Treasure chest. I'm Roddy Lankman.

36
00:03:06,781 --> 00:03:08,592
Well, before we start
the bonus round,

37
00:03:08,627 --> 00:03:11,213
I do have an important
announcement to make.

38
00:03:11,248 --> 00:03:14,031
It's about time. - My contract here at
Treasure chest is almost up,

39
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:16,869
and a lot of people have been
asking what my plans are.

40
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:19,155
Well, this afternoon,
I made a big decision,

41
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,772
and I'd like to share it
with all you people.

42
00:03:22,956 --> 00:03:26,813
I just signed a new 5 year contract,
which means I'm going to be right here

43
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:30,517
doing what I always do for as long
as they want me to be here.

44
00:03:30,552 --> 00:03:32,977
What do you think about that?

45
00:03:51,707 --> 00:03:54,860
Come on.
Oh, my god.

46
00:04:00,768 --> 00:04:02,896
Come on.

47
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:04,424
Oh, my god.

48
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:24,497
MONK Season 3 Epi. 08
Mr. Monk and the Gameshow

49
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:22,710
- Oh, this is looking good.
- You think so?

50
00:05:22,745 --> 00:05:24,977
Oh, it's looking fantastic.

51
00:05:25,012 --> 00:05:28,590
A little more mayonnaise,
a pinch of paprika.

52
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,264
Maybe two pinches.
Maybe three pinches.

53
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:32,166
- Okay, that's perfect.
- Maybe four pinches.

54
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:34,243
Okay, Kevin, I think
that's enough. Thank you.

55
00:05:34,278 --> 00:05:38,321
We are going to need some pepper,
and I think I have some upstairs.

56
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:42,374
Maybe I should bring all my
seasonings down here

57
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,011
if we're going to be
cooking all week.

58
00:05:44,046 --> 00:05:46,527
All week? - Here's something
you might find interesting.

59
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:51,757
This is only the eighth time in my life
I have ever had egg salad. - Really?

60
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:54,238
And how much do you want
to bet I can name all eight?

61
00:05:56,497 --> 00:05:58,951
The first time was in third grade.

62
00:05:58,986 --> 00:06:01,894
I traded sandwiches with a kid
named Stuart kramer.

63
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:05,948
Then three years after that,
my cousin's confirmation party.

64
00:06:05,983 --> 00:06:10,595
Two years after that, I was in
a restaurant. I ordered tuna fish.

65
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,216
- Do you like to laugh?
- No, I don't.

66
00:06:12,251 --> 00:06:14,391
Well, get ready to,
because I knew it was egg salad.

67
00:06:14,426 --> 00:06:17,097
I could smell it,
but the waitress kept saying to me,

68
00:06:17,132 --> 00:06:19,987
"No, it's tuna fish."
Phone.

69
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,619
We're on number three.
Remember where we are.

70
00:06:22,654 --> 00:06:25,139
Hello?
Oh, Sharona.

71
00:06:25,174 --> 00:06:27,562
Sharona, how, how's your mom?

72
00:06:27,597 --> 00:06:31,667
Oh, good. Oh, thank god.
Thank god for modern medicine.

73
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:35,045
Not, not too good, actually.

74
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,366
He's in the kitchen right now

75
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:40,566
naming every egg salad
sandwich he ever had.

76
00:06:41,503 --> 00:06:45,001
Eight, including today.

77
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:49,925
It's not funny.
Stop, stop laughing.

78
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:54,258
Sharona, I don't, I don't know
why you asked him to look in on me.

79
00:06:54,293 --> 00:06:58,152
I'm not a child.
Please stop laughing.

80
00:06:58,813 --> 00:07:02,926
Okay, I'll call you back.
Give her my best. Okay.

81
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:09,822
And when you come back...
bring a gun. Okay. bye.

82
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:14,444
That was Sharona.
She won't be coming back until monday.

83
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,951
Monday.
Wow.

84
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:19,336
We are going to need
some more food.

85
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:21,846
Let's make a list.

86
00:07:24,072 --> 00:07:25,934
Okay.

87
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:28,414
Bread, juice

88
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:31,803
paprika, milk...

89
00:07:31,838 --> 00:07:33,689
No milk. Right.

90
00:07:33,724 --> 00:07:38,208
Crossing that off the list.
Adding to the list, bok choy.

91
00:07:38,243 --> 00:07:39,751
Doorbell.

92
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:46,357
Who is it?

93
00:07:46,855 --> 00:07:50,583
It's Trudy's father.
It's my father-in-law.

94
00:07:50,618 --> 00:07:53,221
- Yeah, he called this morning.
- Why didn't you tell me?

95
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:56,194
I did. I wrote it on a post-it note.

96
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:58,411
We need more of those, by the way.
We're out of them.

97
00:08:00,555 --> 00:08:03,866
- Adrian.
- Dwight.

98
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,549
Dad.

99
00:08:13,686 --> 00:08:17,486
Yeah.
I missed you, too.

100
00:08:18,926 --> 00:08:21,033
Mr. E., here's your coffee.

101
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,678
Sorry it took so long.
I'm still not used to that kitchen.

102
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,696
- Careful. It's hot.
- Thank you, Kevin.

103
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:31,752
- Oh. There's something in there.
- That's a raisin.

104
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:33,440
I put it in to sweeten the coffee.

105
00:08:33,475 --> 00:08:36,838
Little trick I picked up when
I was waiting tables in Aspen, Colorado,

106
00:08:36,873 --> 00:08:39,967
which I did for two summers.
Not two consecutive summers,

107
00:08:40,002 --> 00:08:41,359
'cause there was
a summer in between...

108
00:08:41,394 --> 00:08:42,702
- Thank you, Kevin.
- Thank you, Kevin.

109
00:08:42,737 --> 00:08:45,012
- Delicious.
- Okay.

110
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:51,717
- Oh, happy birthday.
- Oh, thank you.

111
00:08:52,301 --> 00:08:56,926
- Did you get my card?
- Uh, yes, I did.

112
00:08:56,961 --> 00:08:58,487
Did you look inside?

113
00:08:58,522 --> 00:09:02,922
'Cause the punch line was
on the inside. - Yes, I did.

114
00:09:02,957 --> 00:09:06,435
- It was very funny.
- It was a pun.

115
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,769
It was very funny. It's on my mantel.
Everybody likes it.

116
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,836
- How is Marcia?
- Much better.

117
00:09:16,871 --> 00:09:20,397
She's, uh, volunteering
as a grief counselor.

118
00:09:21,297 --> 00:09:23,426
Believe me, she's good at it.

119
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,343
Send her my love.

120
00:09:27,378 --> 00:09:30,551
Well, I was hoping that wouldn't be
necessary. That's why I'm here.

121
00:09:30,586 --> 00:09:34,338
I was hoping you might come back
with me to Los angeles.

122
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:37,104
I'm producing a new game show.

123
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:39,294
It's called "Treasure chest."

124
00:09:39,932 --> 00:09:42,482
Wow. Wow.
Is that your show?

125
00:09:42,517 --> 00:09:44,514
Because I love that show.

126
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:46,843
Who comes up with
all those questions?

127
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,774
Well, we have a staff of writers.

128
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:53,556
'Cause I'll tell you something,

129
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:56,274
that is something I've always
thought I would be good at.

130
00:09:56,309 --> 00:09:58,315
I'm always asking people questions,

131
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,242
and a lot of the time, they
are genuinely stumped.

132
00:10:01,277 --> 00:10:03,623
That's true. We are.

133
00:10:05,158 --> 00:10:08,916
Adrian...
My little show's in trouble.

134
00:10:08,951 --> 00:10:11,044
- I think it's serious.
- What is it?

135
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:13,727
Well, I'd rather you
see for yourself.

136
00:10:13,762 --> 00:10:16,706
Do you think you could come
down to L. A. for a couple of days?

137
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,048
Plenty of room.
Marcia would love it.

138
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:23,976
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.
Dwight, I, I can't.

139
00:10:24,011 --> 00:10:27,465
Uh, I, I, I can't just leave.

140
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,730
- Sharona's not here.
- I'm here. We could go.

141
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,497
Uh, I don't know.

142
00:10:34,532 --> 00:10:36,479
Come on, it'll be fun.

143
00:10:36,514 --> 00:10:40,726
Three guys on a road trip
to Hollywood.

144
00:11:09,432 --> 00:11:11,299
- Is Roddy Lankman here?
- Lenny,

145
00:11:11,334 --> 00:11:13,519
tell Bernie not to start
the music cues too soon,

146
00:11:13,554 --> 00:11:15,446
and make sure the affiliates
are sitting in the front row.

147
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:18,010
- Mr. E., is Roddy Lankman here?
- He's probably in makeup.

148
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:19,112
Okay, do you think
I could talk to him?

149
00:11:19,147 --> 00:11:21,904
'Cause I have some ideas
that I'd like to run by him.

150
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:24,770
Don't worry, mr. E., I won't
embarrass you. - I'm sure you won't.

151
00:11:24,805 --> 00:11:27,507
It's just that Roddy doesn't
like to be disturbed before the show.

152
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:28,990
Tanya.

153
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,960
This is Kevin dorfman, a friend
of mine from San francisco.

154
00:11:33,995 --> 00:11:35,547
Would you mind showing him around?

155
00:11:35,582 --> 00:11:37,419
- I'd be happy to.
- You're the pointer.

156
00:11:37,454 --> 00:11:39,640
Oh, point to something.

157
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,660
It looks better.
She makes everything look better, Tanya.

158
00:11:42,695 --> 00:11:45,808
- Hey, how did you get this job?
- I want you to meet someone.

159
00:11:49,714 --> 00:11:51,463
Val birch.

160
00:11:51,498 --> 00:11:53,443
This is my old friend, Adrian monk.

161
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:54,962
Adrian.

162
00:11:54,997 --> 00:11:57,095
Well, gym class must have
been hell with a name like that.

163
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,613
Yes.
Yes, it was. Thank you.

164
00:11:58,648 --> 00:12:00,774
Are you nearly done, or do
you just like touching me?

165
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:02,915
Adrian's here from San francisco.

166
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:06,709
Oh, Frisco. God-awful town.
I was there last year.

167
00:12:06,744 --> 00:12:08,437
It was foggy the whole week.

168
00:12:08,472 --> 00:12:11,173
When are they going to do
something about all that fog?

169
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:14,573
Well, I, I don't know.
I'll make some calls.

170
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,521
I couldn't see a damn thing,
not even that, um...

171
00:12:17,556 --> 00:12:18,993
Uh, Golden bridge they got.

172
00:12:19,028 --> 00:12:22,471
- The Golden gate.
- No, genius, the bridge.

173
00:12:22,506 --> 00:12:24,374
Right. That's what they
call it the golden...

174
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:26,556
Okay, okay.
Testing, 1, 2, 3.

175
00:12:26,591 --> 00:12:29,008
We're done, okay?

176
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:34,858
That idiot's won seven times in a row.

177
00:12:34,893 --> 00:12:39,525
Adrian, I know he's cheating.
I just can't figure out how.

178
00:12:46,285 --> 00:12:50,156
- Roddy Lankman?
- Uh, yeah.

179
00:12:50,191 --> 00:12:54,050
Kevin dorfman. I'm a big fan
of yours, sir. A major fan.

180
00:12:54,085 --> 00:12:58,244
- Okay, how you doing?
- Look, I know we just met, Roddy,

181
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:01,546
but I understand you have
your own production company.

182
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:04,224
Well, that's good,
because I have an idea for a show,

183
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:07,254
and if you're interested,
we can produce it together.

184
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:09,529
- I really can't.
- Okay.

185
00:13:09,564 --> 00:13:10,895
It's called "40 winks."
In a nutshell,

186
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:17,306
three contestants, three beds.
The first one who falls asleep wins.

187
00:13:17,341 --> 00:13:20,351
So we're watching people
fall asleep? - Exactly.

188
00:13:20,386 --> 00:13:23,789
- You snooze, you win.
- I can't do that.

189
00:13:23,824 --> 00:13:26,788
I, I can't even really talk
to strangers about ideas.

190
00:13:26,823 --> 00:13:28,944
It's for legal reasons.

191
00:13:28,979 --> 00:13:31,561
Well, it's a good thing
I'm not a stranger, then.

192
00:13:31,596 --> 00:13:34,001
- I'm friends with Dwight Ellison.
- Oh, really?

193
00:13:34,036 --> 00:13:38,350
I'm here with Adrian monk,
the detective. - Detective?

194
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:41,661
Yeah, from San francisco.
Dwight brought him here to look around.

195
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,409
He's having some sort of
problem with the show.

196
00:13:45,593 --> 00:13:47,662
Huh.

197
00:13:47,697 --> 00:13:50,120
- Nice to meet you.
- All right.

198
00:13:51,222 --> 00:13:53,659
- A detective?
- Will you keep it down?

199
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:55,759
He's from San francisco.
That's all I know.

200
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:58,260
- So what?
- So what?

201
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,718
- He's going to be watching us.
- So let him watch.

202
00:14:00,753 --> 00:14:04,101
He's not going to figure it out.
The system is perfect.

203
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:06,212
Now, look, here's what's
going to happen.

204
00:14:06,247 --> 00:14:08,848
I'm going to win tonight,
I'm going to win tomorrow,

205
00:14:08,883 --> 00:14:11,949
and I'm going to keep on winning
until I say we're done.

206
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,847
- It's too dangerous.
- It's too dangerous, huh?

207
00:14:15,882 --> 00:14:19,875
Well, I guess you should have thought
of that before you killed your assistant.

208
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,754
Now let's go back inside.
It's showtime.

209
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,106
It's driving me nuts,
Adrian. I need someone

210
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:37,809
to look at this from a different angle.

211
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:39,987
- Maybe I'm missing something.
- Are you sure he's cheating?

212
00:14:40,022 --> 00:14:43,142
He has to be.
That Neanderthal Val birch...

213
00:14:43,177 --> 00:14:45,115
he's been answering
graduate-level questions

214
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,129
in geography, history,
astronomy.

215
00:14:48,164 --> 00:14:50,156
Nobody's that smart,
not even you.

216
00:14:50,191 --> 00:14:52,695
So he has to be getting
the questions in advance.

217
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,144
Maybe somebody's helping
him, one of the writers.

218
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:56,379
I thought of that.

219
00:14:56,414 --> 00:14:59,195
For the last two weeks, I've
been writing all the questions myself.

220
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,405
These are the ones
we're using tonight.

221
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,291
- Who else gets to see these?
- Nobody.

222
00:15:04,326 --> 00:15:06,744
Not the director,
not even Roddy.

223
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:08,668
These envelopes stay sealed

224
00:15:08,703 --> 00:15:12,966
until he opens them on stage
during the actual game.

225
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:19,130
What are you doing?
What is that?

226
00:15:19,165 --> 00:15:20,768
It's Roddy Lankman's pencil.

227
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:23,547
Yeah, those are his teeth marks.

228
00:15:23,582 --> 00:15:25,229
This is what you
call a collectible.

229
00:15:25,264 --> 00:15:27,157
You can look,
but don't touch.

230
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,781
- I don't want to touch it.
- Yeah, right.

231
00:15:28,816 --> 00:15:30,456
Seriously, don't touch it.

232
00:15:30,491 --> 00:15:33,187
Live from Hollywood, California,

233
00:15:33,222 --> 00:15:35,702
let's grab those shovels and go digging,

234
00:15:35,737 --> 00:15:39,373
'cause the name of the game
is "Treasure chest".

235
00:15:39,408 --> 00:15:43,175
Here's your host,
Roddy Lankman!

236
00:15:44,614 --> 00:15:46,585
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome back to "Treasure chest."

237
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,385
I'm Roddy Lankman, and, boy,
what a nice crowd we have today,

238
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,836
but let's welcome back
our reigning champion.

239
00:15:51,871 --> 00:15:55,600
He's been here for three weeks. He shows
absolutely no signs of slowing down.

240
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:57,711
He's a retired limousine driver
from Woodland hills.

241
00:15:57,746 --> 00:16:00,798
In his free time, he likes hunting
and fishing up in the Bluestone valley.

242
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,066
Welcome back to the show, Val birch!

243
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,286
What is the largest desert in Asia?

244
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:18,242
Is it A, the Sahara, B, the Negev,
C, the Gobi, D..

245
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,317
C, the Gobi.

246
00:16:19,352 --> 00:16:21,148
Correct for $1,000!

247
00:16:25,711 --> 00:16:29,287
Thank you, Tanya.
The next question, for $1,500.

248
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,098
which Monarch is sometimes
known as "the Tragic queen"?

249
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:35,066
Was it A, queen Elizabeth,
B, Marie antoinette,

250
00:16:35,101 --> 00:16:37,080
C, Catherine the Great...

251
00:16:37,115 --> 00:16:39,766
B, Mary ann tonette.

252
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:42,387
Uh, that is correct.
Marie antoinette.

253
00:16:45,356 --> 00:16:47,167
He mispronounced it.

254
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:50,443
Here's a $2,000 question,

255
00:16:50,478 --> 00:16:52,409
and I see this one has a visual clue,

256
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,622
so, Tanya, if you could
bring up our visual.

257
00:16:55,337 --> 00:16:56,788
Thank yon very much!

258
00:16:56,823 --> 00:16:59,240
Which founding father
lived in this house?

259
00:16:59,275 --> 00:17:03,350
Was it A, George washington,
B, Thomas jefferson, C...

260
00:17:03,385 --> 00:17:06,466
- B, Jefferson.
- Jefferson is correct for $2,000.

261
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:09,242
Pitching another perfect game,
Val birch.

262
00:17:10,173 --> 00:17:11,717
- Did you see that?
- What?

263
00:17:11,752 --> 00:17:15,380
He didn't even look at the picture,
and he still got it right.

264
00:17:15,415 --> 00:17:18,433
How? - Maybe they're
signaling each other.

265
00:17:18,468 --> 00:17:22,115
Val birch is still in the lead
with a grand total of $234,000!

266
00:17:23,763 --> 00:17:26,719
That's a lot of money, Val.
What do you plan to do with it?

267
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,340
I don't know.
Let's just keep playing.

268
00:17:34,611 --> 00:17:36,296
Marcia.

269
00:17:36,331 --> 00:17:38,765
Come see what the cat dragged in.

270
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,840
- Adrian.
- Marcia.

271
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:43,678
Welcome home.

272
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,876
Thank you.

273
00:17:46,971 --> 00:17:48,850
You okay?

274
00:17:48,885 --> 00:17:51,033
Yes, I'm, I'm just...

275
00:17:51,762 --> 00:17:54,754
- there are so many memories.
- I know.

276
00:17:55,546 --> 00:17:58,027
That's why we could never move.

277
00:17:58,062 --> 00:17:59,969
Oh, honey, this is Kevin dorfman.

278
00:18:00,004 --> 00:18:04,159
Hello. Kevin dorfman.
I live above Adrian.

279
00:18:04,194 --> 00:18:07,222
May I say what a lovely home you
have here. - Oh, thank you.

280
00:18:07,257 --> 00:18:09,286
- Spanish style, isn't it?
- Yes.

281
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:12,555
Yes, I thought so.
I grew up in a house just like this,

282
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:16,255
except the dining room
was over on this side...

283
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,636
Hello.

284
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:35,658
Hi, mom, dad.
This is Adrian.

285
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:39,889
- Mr. and Mrs. Ellison.
- It's Dwight and Marcia.

286
00:18:39,924 --> 00:18:42,802
I feel like we're old friends,
the way Trudy talks about you.

287
00:18:42,837 --> 00:18:45,307
She's been sending us
articles and newspaper stories.

288
00:18:45,342 --> 00:18:47,631
You can believe about 40% of that stuff.

289
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,864
Come in, come in.

290
00:18:49,899 --> 00:18:51,952
You must be exhausted.

291
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,113
- Nice to see you.
- So good to see you, too.

292
00:18:55,148 --> 00:18:58,064
Oh, that's okay.
We don't mind a little dirt.

293
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:02,148
- Almost done.
- Okay.

294
00:19:03,595 --> 00:19:06,036
You have a beautiful home.

295
00:19:07,452 --> 00:19:09,680
Well, that's fascinating.

296
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,751
Well, come on in.

297
00:19:11,786 --> 00:19:14,512
I'm sure you must
all be exhausted.

298
00:19:15,075 --> 00:19:17,814
Adrian, you remember
where the guest room is?

299
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:19,423
Oh, yeah.

300
00:19:58,383 --> 00:20:00,628
It's still how she left it.

301
00:20:00,663 --> 00:20:02,164
Do you want to go in?

302
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:05,639
There might be something
you want to keep.

303
00:20:11,027 --> 00:20:13,194
I can't.

304
00:20:13,229 --> 00:20:15,133
I know.

305
00:20:15,168 --> 00:20:18,283
It took me 2 and half years.

306
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:22,220
How did you do it, Marcia?

307
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,215
How did you survive?

308
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,503
I didn't think I would.

309
00:20:31,246 --> 00:20:33,014
I was buried alive.

310
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:35,289
Buried alive.

311
00:20:38,952 --> 00:20:42,639
And then one day,
the sun came up.

312
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,106
My garden was blooming.

313
00:20:44,141 --> 00:20:47,145
Kids were riding by the house
on their bikes,

314
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,361
and I decided to give
the world a second chance.

315
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,731
It's still a beautiful world, Adrian.

316
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:10,336
- You don't have to do that.
- It's no problem.

317
00:21:10,371 --> 00:21:15,249
I remember how you like
everything separated. It's okay.

318
00:21:15,284 --> 00:21:18,296
So, Kevin, did I understand
Adrian correctly?

319
00:21:18,331 --> 00:21:20,410
You won the lottery
a couple years ago?

320
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,462
Yes, I did.
That is accurate.

321
00:21:25,063 --> 00:21:27,511
And you're probably wondering
what happened to all the money.

322
00:21:27,546 --> 00:21:29,920
That's a fair question.
Here's a tip.

323
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,316
if you're ever lucky enough
to win the big jackpot,

324
00:21:32,351 --> 00:21:35,838
you should probably not make
some of the mistakes I made.

325
00:21:35,873 --> 00:21:38,992
For one thing, Vegas.
it's a good place to avoid.

326
00:21:39,027 --> 00:21:41,967
Secondly, if you're ever
going to hire an accountant,

327
00:21:42,002 --> 00:21:44,667
you might want to make sure
he's certified.

328
00:21:44,702 --> 00:21:47,269
And most importantly, never,
under any circumstances,

329
00:21:47,304 --> 00:21:49,657
marry Lisa Abromowitz.

330
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,829
I'll try to remember that.

331
00:21:54,864 --> 00:21:56,988
Or her sister Shelly.

332
00:22:02,884 --> 00:22:05,230
Is something wrong
with the food?

333
00:22:05,265 --> 00:22:07,711
Oh, no, mom.
It's perfect.

334
00:22:07,746 --> 00:22:10,377
I'll, um, explain later.

335
00:22:11,018 --> 00:22:14,630
Adrian, I'm producing
a new cop show in the fall.

336
00:22:14,665 --> 00:22:18,608
We're looking for a consultant to work
with the writers, keep us honest.

337
00:22:18,643 --> 00:22:22,622
The position is yours
if you want it. - Wow.

338
00:22:23,323 --> 00:22:24,743
Dwight, I don't know what to say.

339
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:25,712
Why don't you say yes?

340
00:22:25,747 --> 00:22:28,889
Dad, that's really sweet, but
Adrian would never quit his job.

341
00:22:28,924 --> 00:22:31,357
It's his life.
Oh, you guys should see him.

342
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:33,198
- He is so brilliant.
- Here we go.

343
00:22:33,233 --> 00:22:34,161
When he's at a crime scene,

344
00:22:34,196 --> 00:22:36,546
the other policemen, they just
stand back and watch him work.

345
00:22:36,581 --> 00:22:38,335
They watch me so
they know what not to do.

346
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,291
Oh, you are so modest.

347
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:44,213
Besides, we love San francisco.
I really can't see us ever leaving.

348
00:22:44,248 --> 00:22:45,867
It's so far away.

349
00:22:45,902 --> 00:22:48,441
Not the way Trudy drives.

350
00:22:48,476 --> 00:22:51,146
So you won't be moving back.

351
00:22:51,181 --> 00:22:55,263
Well, Adrian, you take
care of my little girl.

352
00:22:55,298 --> 00:22:58,962
- She's all we have.
- Yes, sir. I will.

353
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,905
I'm so sorry.

354
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,947
- About what?
- Wait a minute.

355
00:23:12,982 --> 00:23:14,989
Hold the phone.
I've got it.

356
00:23:15,024 --> 00:23:18,418
Got what? - How they're
cheating on the show.

357
00:23:18,453 --> 00:23:20,071
It's a code.

358
00:23:20,106 --> 00:23:24,535
Roddy Lankman is blinking
when he asks the questions.

359
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,439
Like once for A, two for B.

360
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:31,925
- That's what he does.
- No, no, no, no. I thought about that.

361
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,112
I've studied every frame
from every show. It's impossible.

362
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:38,239
He never blinks
or gestures or changes his voice,

363
00:23:38,274 --> 00:23:40,579
at least that I could tell.

364
00:23:40,614 --> 00:23:43,908
Well, you were there. Did you
notice anything? - No, no.

365
00:23:43,943 --> 00:23:46,484
But when can I talk
to this Mr. Lankman?

366
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:49,285
I've already asked him.
He won't talk to you or anybody.

367
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,364
These days, he hardly ever
leaves his trailer.

368
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:54,448
Poor guy's had
a pretty tough year.

369
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:56,187
What happened?

370
00:23:56,222 --> 00:23:58,489
Well, for one thing,
he's broke.

371
00:23:58,524 --> 00:24:00,314
He declared bankruptcy
last January.

372
00:24:00,349 --> 00:24:03,194
- And then there was the accident.
- What accident?

373
00:24:03,229 --> 00:24:07,223
Last month his personal assistant,
a girl named Lizzie Talvo, was killed.

374
00:24:07,258 --> 00:24:10,894
Her car went off the road
in Bluestone valley.

375
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:13,918
- Roddy took it pretty hard.
- Bluestone valley?

376
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:17,616
Val birch goes fishing
in Bluestone valley.

377
00:24:18,101 --> 00:24:21,812
They mentioned it on the show
when they introduced him.

378
00:24:22,938 --> 00:24:28,314
Val birch fishes...
where the girl was killed.

379
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,614
He fishes where the girl was killed.

380
00:24:33,649 --> 00:24:36,024
That's probably important.

381
00:24:37,071 --> 00:24:39,398
Did you notice he said it twice?

382
00:24:50,743 --> 00:24:52,620
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

383
00:24:53,084 --> 00:24:56,139
- Why are you making that face?
- We're in rugged terrain.

384
00:24:56,174 --> 00:24:58,364
This is my rugged
terrain face. - Okay.

385
00:25:00,692 --> 00:25:04,345
Okay, she was,
she was traveling east.

386
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,965
Her car went off the road
up there, ended up...

387
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,398
right here between
these two rocks.

388
00:25:11,433 --> 00:25:14,804
- Haven't the police already been here?
- Well, that's true but...

389
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:19,461
they weren't really looking for anything.
This wasn't a criminal investigation.

390
00:25:26,755 --> 00:25:28,243
What is it?

391
00:25:28,747 --> 00:25:30,385
Something?

392
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,412
Something intended for Dwight Ellison.

393
00:25:39,737 --> 00:25:43,775
- An exercise tape.
- Did you bring those baggies?

394
00:25:44,901 --> 00:25:46,906
Oh, this is real evidence, isn't it?

395
00:25:46,941 --> 00:25:49,284
Oh, goodness.
I feel like a...

396
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:54,454
- What's the matter? Are you okay?
- I just swallowed a bug.

397
00:25:54,489 --> 00:25:58,248
- You, you what?
- I'm okay. - - Oh, god.

398
00:26:10,922 --> 00:26:12,563
What is it?

399
00:26:20,903 --> 00:26:22,562
It's Val birch.

400
00:26:23,846 --> 00:26:25,221
He was here.

401
00:26:28,886 --> 00:26:30,806
Kevin? - It's okay.
I spit that one out.

402
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:33,649
Oh, god. Just,
let's get out of here,

403
00:26:33,684 --> 00:26:36,403
and just, for god's sake,
cover your mouth. - Okay.

404
00:26:36,438 --> 00:26:37,816
It's just a videotape.

405
00:26:37,851 --> 00:26:40,229
"Thighs and abs: 10 minutes
a day to a perfect you."

406
00:26:40,264 --> 00:26:42,731
Does that mean anything to you?
Yeah, me neither.

407
00:26:42,766 --> 00:26:45,653
We're at Val birch's house now.
I want to have another word with him.

408
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:48,289
No, I'll be fine.
Thanks. I appreciate that, Dwight.

409
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,023
I don't think he's home.

410
00:26:58,046 --> 00:26:59,845
Hello, Mr. Birch?

411
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,601
Hello, it's Adrian monk.
We spoke yesterday at the show.

412
00:27:04,157 --> 00:27:05,482
Mr. Birch?

413
00:27:05,517 --> 00:27:09,337
I'm here, too. Kevin dorfman.
I'm his upstairs neighbor.

414
00:27:15,361 --> 00:27:18,722
It looks unlocked?
What do you think?

415
00:27:18,757 --> 00:27:21,339
Well, we can't go in
without a reason.

416
00:27:22,943 --> 00:27:26,801
- I'm kind of thirsty. Does that count?
- No, Kevin.

417
00:27:26,836 --> 00:27:28,718
Thirst is no excuse for
breaking and entering.

418
00:27:28,753 --> 00:27:32,430
- Wouldn't it be cool if it was?
- Yes, that would be cool.

419
00:27:32,465 --> 00:27:34,668
Here. Let me...

420
00:27:34,703 --> 00:27:35,998
what are you doing?
What are you doing?

421
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:39,146
I'm leaning in. Yeah, I went to
law school for three semesters.

422
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:41,958
You can lean anywhere you want.
It's in the constitution.

423
00:27:43,003 --> 00:27:45,672
I can't imagine which constitution
you're referring to.

424
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:47,957
You know what?
Grab my pants.

425
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:51,199
Pardon me? - Grab my pants.
I need the counterweight.

426
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:53,033
Kevin, I really don't
want to grab your pants.

427
00:27:53,986 --> 00:27:56,834
If I touch that floor,
it's a felony.

428
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,172
Mr. Birch?

429
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:17,743
Hello?
Mr. Birch?.

430
00:28:17,778 --> 00:28:19,794
Hello?

431
00:28:19,829 --> 00:28:23,403
Kevin, you see that pencil on the chair?
Can you reach that?

432
00:28:33,424 --> 00:28:37,182
- You got it?
- I got it. Pull me. Yes, I got it.

433
00:28:39,336 --> 00:28:42,684
Do you still have the pencil that
Roddy Lankman gave you yesterday?

434
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:45,364
- The collectible.
- The collectible.

435
00:28:52,925 --> 00:28:56,998
- Kevin, do you have the pencil?
- I have the pencil.

436
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,594
He was here.

437
00:29:02,465 --> 00:29:04,394
Roddy Lankman was here...

438
00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:05,675
but why?

439
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,354
Maybe they were trying
to figure out how to cheat.

440
00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:10,016
Let's go.

441
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:15,009
Hi, this is your old pal Val.

442
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,257
Leave your message
when you hear the beep.

443
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:20,459
He's checking his messages.

444
00:29:20,494 --> 00:29:25,077
You have one saved message.
May 2nd, 7:39 P. M.

445
00:29:25,112 --> 00:29:26,849
He's skipping that one.

446
00:29:26,884 --> 00:29:31,945
You have one new message.
Today, 10:15 A. M.

447
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,841
Mr. Birch, this is Tony Forrest
at Southland mercedes.

448
00:29:34,876 --> 00:29:36,197
I have some good news for you.

449
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,746
The new 640 you ordered
will be in tomorrow.

450
00:29:38,781 --> 00:29:40,946
I got it here in three weeks
just like I promised.

451
00:29:40,981 --> 00:29:42,982
Let me know when you
want to pick it up.

452
00:29:46,435 --> 00:29:49,739
He ordered a new Mercedes-Benz
four weeks ago.

453
00:29:50,314 --> 00:29:51,992
Before he went on the show.

454
00:29:52,027 --> 00:29:53,926
That's what I call confidence.
He knew he was going to win.

455
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:57,484
If we can figure out how they're
cheating, we can nail them both.

456
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:01,210
- I have to get closer.
- Closer?

457
00:30:01,245 --> 00:30:03,593
Yesterday we were
in the front row.

458
00:30:03,628 --> 00:30:05,706
You can't get much
closer than that.

459
00:30:08,447 --> 00:30:10,670
Please welcome to the show, Adrian monk.

460
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:29,917
Welcome to the show, Adrian.

461
00:30:29,952 --> 00:30:31,893
Mr. E., You are not going to regret this.

462
00:30:31,928 --> 00:30:34,756
Is there anybody you'd
like to say hello to? - Yes.

463
00:30:35,272 --> 00:30:39,227
Okay, who would that be? - Sharona.
She's in New Jersey visiting her mother.

464
00:30:39,262 --> 00:30:42,617
Oh, that's very nice. How long have
you and Sharona been married?

465
00:30:42,938 --> 00:30:44,625
No, no, no.

466
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,937
Uh, Sharona is my nurse.

467
00:30:45,972 --> 00:30:50,165
I was married, but my wife
Trudy was killed by a car bomb.

468
00:30:51,878 --> 00:30:53,449
Did he just say "car bomb"?

469
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:58,197
Which is why I have devoted my life
to putting criminals behind bars,

470
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:02,238
even famous, powerful men
who think they're above the law.

471
00:31:05,189 --> 00:31:08,004
Uh, I'm sure you do
a great job, too.

472
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:11,772
- All right, who wants to...
- Dig for treasure?

473
00:31:11,807 --> 00:31:13,515
All right, Tanya, let's get
this game started.

474
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,710
We're going to start out
with a $1,000 question.

475
00:31:17,424 --> 00:31:19,182
Where...

476
00:31:19,217 --> 00:31:21,051
Adrian.

477
00:31:21,987 --> 00:31:23,774
I'm sorry.

478
00:31:24,434 --> 00:31:28,253
Um, there was a smudge
on my buzzer thing.

479
00:31:28,288 --> 00:31:30,410
Well, I'm sorry, but according
to our rule book,

480
00:31:30,445 --> 00:31:32,212
you'll have to answer the question.

481
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,559
Could you repeat the question, please?

482
00:31:34,594 --> 00:31:37,863
Yes, but unfortunately, only the
part that you've already heard,

483
00:31:37,898 --> 00:31:41,695
so... where?

484
00:31:42,593 --> 00:31:44,033
Where?

485
00:31:50,382 --> 00:31:51,896
Where?

486
00:31:54,109 --> 00:31:55,765
Once more, please.

487
00:31:56,648 --> 00:32:00,888
- Where?
- Where...

488
00:32:00,923 --> 00:32:03,688
you have 10 seconds.

489
00:32:05,514 --> 00:32:07,415
Constantinople.

490
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,253
Well, we're a multiple choice show,

491
00:32:09,288 --> 00:32:11,550
so all we need is A, B, C, or D.

492
00:32:11,585 --> 00:32:14,849
- D.
- D?

493
00:32:14,884 --> 00:32:17,079
- No, B.
- B.

494
00:32:17,114 --> 00:32:18,922
B. B. Definitely B.

495
00:32:18,957 --> 00:32:22,912
- B, and that's your final answer.
- A.

496
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:27,463
Uh, well, the correct answer
is C, Macy's.

497
00:32:28,478 --> 00:32:33,383
Moving on, let's go
to our $1,500 question.

498
00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:36,472
Oh, for the love of god.

499
00:32:36,507 --> 00:32:39,544
I'm sorry. It's still
a little grimy here.

500
00:32:41,094 --> 00:32:44,143
Time is money for some of us.

501
00:32:44,178 --> 00:32:45,645
Okay, I'll try.

502
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,521
All right, moving
onto the $1,500 question...

503
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:07,284
Okay. I'm done.

504
00:33:12,334 --> 00:33:16,632
That's it. - What element do you
add to iron to make steel?

505
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:19,302
Is it A, aluminum, B, carbon,

506
00:33:19,337 --> 00:33:22,501
- C, lead, or...
- B, carbon.

507
00:33:22,536 --> 00:33:24,844
Carbon is correct for $1,500.

508
00:33:25,578 --> 00:33:27,349
They're still cheating.

509
00:33:28,097 --> 00:33:31,142
But why would they do that
with Adrian out there?

510
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,453
They have no choice.

511
00:33:33,488 --> 00:33:35,630
- If Val loses today, he can't come back.
- What Greek city hosted

512
00:33:35,665 --> 00:33:37,154
- the original olympics?
- That's a good point.

513
00:33:37,189 --> 00:33:40,075
Was it A, Athens, B, Rhodes,

514
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:43,031
- C, Olympia...
- C, Olympia.

515
00:33:43,066 --> 00:33:46,084
Correct again for $1,500.

516
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:51,849
He figured it out.

517
00:33:51,884 --> 00:33:54,016
He knows how they're cheating.

518
00:34:01,571 --> 00:34:04,465
One minute. We are back in one.

519
00:34:06,114 --> 00:34:08,986
- So you figured it out?
- Yes, sir. I know how they're cheating.

520
00:34:09,021 --> 00:34:10,537
Was I right about
the blinking? - No.

521
00:34:10,572 --> 00:34:12,769
- Was I close?
- No.

522
00:34:12,804 --> 00:34:14,146
But it is a code.

523
00:34:14,181 --> 00:34:17,514
Lankman is holding the question
cards differently every time.

524
00:34:18,081 --> 00:34:21,004
If he holds it by this corner,
it means the answer is A.

525
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:23,411
This corner means B,
and this one's for C.

526
00:34:23,446 --> 00:34:25,065
What do we do now?

527
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:28,019
I guess we call the police.

528
00:34:28,054 --> 00:34:31,867
Hi, it's me. It's 7:15.
Call me when you get home.

529
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:34,132
I love you.

530
00:34:41,974 --> 00:34:43,340
Dwight...

531
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:45,488
Dwight!

532
00:34:45,523 --> 00:34:47,100
When did Lizzie Talvo die?

533
00:34:47,135 --> 00:34:48,852
- What was the date?
- May 2nd.

534
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:50,383
May 2nd. About what time?

535
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:54,398
- Evening, while the show was on.
- Around 7:39 P. M.?

536
00:34:54,433 --> 00:34:57,104
- That sounds about right.
- Don't call the police. Not yet.

537
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:59,201
These men are guilty of
more than just cheating,

538
00:34:59,236 --> 00:35:00,849
and I think I can prove it.

539
00:35:00,884 --> 00:35:03,331
- You're going to prove it now?
- If I don't do it now,

540
00:35:03,366 --> 00:35:05,036
they might destroy the evidence.

541
00:35:05,071 --> 00:35:09,223
- 15 seconds! Places!
- I got to go. I got to go.

542
00:35:09,258 --> 00:35:11,973
Listen, isn't there a way to make
a phone call during the show?

543
00:35:12,008 --> 00:35:14,488
Well, you can phone a friend, but
only if you make it to the bonus round.

544
00:35:14,523 --> 00:35:16,421
Oh, you're so far behind.
You'll never make it.

545
00:35:16,456 --> 00:35:21,729
Five seconds!
4, 3, 2...

546
00:35:24,761 --> 00:35:27,379
Welcome back to "Treasure chest."
My name is Roddy Lankman,

547
00:35:27,414 --> 00:35:33,646
and our reigning champ Val birch
is in the lead again with $3,000.

548
00:35:33,681 --> 00:35:36,561
In second place, Susan with zero,

549
00:35:36,596 --> 00:35:39,223
and, Adrian, you're at negative $1,000.

550
00:35:39,258 --> 00:35:41,369
Well, Roddy, I think
my luck is about to change.

551
00:35:41,404 --> 00:35:45,246
Well, there's only one way to find out.
Let's do round two and dig for treasure.

552
00:35:45,281 --> 00:35:48,368
For $4,000, the bone that connects
your knee to your ankle is

553
00:35:48,403 --> 00:35:51,766
- the A, fibula, B, tibia...
- B, tibia.

554
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,550
That is correct.

555
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,218
Next question.

556
00:35:56,253 --> 00:35:58,588
How many square yards
in an acre? Is...

557
00:35:58,623 --> 00:35:59,558
C.

558
00:36:02,049 --> 00:36:05,754
Uh, C is correct.
It's 4,840 square yards.

559
00:36:06,632 --> 00:36:08,347
Lucky guess.

560
00:36:08,382 --> 00:36:11,354
A lucky guess indeed.
For $5,000...

561
00:36:11,389 --> 00:36:14,749
- D.
- D is correct.

562
00:36:14,784 --> 00:36:17,043
Another lucky guess.

563
00:36:17,078 --> 00:36:20,521
For $5,500, president Mckinley
was assassinated...

564
00:36:20,556 --> 00:36:23,390
- D./- B.
- D. The answer is D, Roddy.

565
00:36:23,425 --> 00:36:26,760
D is correct, yes.
Next question...

566
00:36:26,795 --> 00:36:28,914
- who...
- B, B, B, B, B.

567
00:36:28,949 --> 00:36:31,291
B is correct.
It's Jackson Browne.

568
00:36:31,326 --> 00:36:33,833
- Susan, are you okay?
- I, I just...

569
00:36:33,868 --> 00:36:36,395
it looked so much easier
when I was watching at home.

570
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,253
Yes, it always looks easier at home.

571
00:36:38,288 --> 00:36:40,748
- For $6,000...
- C!

572
00:36:40,783 --> 00:36:42,857
- No, C is not right.
- A.

573
00:36:42,892 --> 00:36:45,071
A is correct. The wombat.

574
00:36:45,106 --> 00:36:47,728
And for the last question,
for $6,000,

575
00:36:47,763 --> 00:36:50,364
- what element...
- D.

576
00:36:52,182 --> 00:36:56,231
D is correct, and that's
the end of round two.

577
00:36:56,266 --> 00:36:58,813
A couple of very intelligent
gentlemen here.

578
00:36:58,848 --> 00:37:02,782
Uh, that means Adrian monk is
the winner of round two.

579
00:37:02,817 --> 00:37:06,690
Val birch, you're going to have
to sit this one out this time.

580
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,749
Adrian, you understand
what happens in round two.

581
00:37:08,784 --> 00:37:10,456
You answer these five
questions correctly,

582
00:37:10,491 --> 00:37:11,763
and you not only win this game,

583
00:37:11,798 --> 00:37:15,051
but you win this great
big pot of gold!

584
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:21,040
You know how we play our game.
You have five questions.

585
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:22,883
Let's see how you do.

586
00:37:22,918 --> 00:37:26,761
Adrian, who was the first president
to win the nobel peace prize?

587
00:37:26,796 --> 00:37:30,071
Roddy, I understand
I can phone a friend.

588
00:37:30,778 --> 00:37:32,519
You want to phone a friend
on the first question.

589
00:37:32,554 --> 00:37:35,974
Well, you're the boss.
Tanya, let's bring him the phone.

590
00:37:36,441 --> 00:37:38,614
For those joining us
for the first time,

591
00:37:38,649 --> 00:37:40,823
Adrian is going to call a friend

592
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:44,074
to see if he can get a little help on
this very important bonus round question.

593
00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:46,325
All right, who would you like to call?

594
00:37:47,785 --> 00:37:50,318
Well, Roddy, I would like to call...

595
00:37:50,353 --> 00:37:53,130
- him.
- Me?

596
00:37:53,165 --> 00:37:55,538
You want to call me?

597
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:58,042
I don't think I'm at home.

598
00:38:01,773 --> 00:38:03,374
Well, Mr. Monk,
what are you doing?

599
00:38:03,409 --> 00:38:05,790
Do you know what he's doing?
Because I don't know what he's doing.

600
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:11,108
I'm trying to prove that you
are guilty of murder, Mr. Lankman,

601
00:38:11,143 --> 00:38:14,478
or at the very least, manslaughter.

602
00:38:14,513 --> 00:38:16,591
Lizzie Talvo, your personal assistant,

603
00:38:16,626 --> 00:38:19,700
discovered that you were
cheating on the show.

604
00:38:20,948 --> 00:38:24,781
- Uh... can we go to a commercial?
- You do and you're fired.

605
00:38:24,816 --> 00:38:27,607
She died about a month ago
in a car crash,

606
00:38:27,642 --> 00:38:30,915
and this man has been
blackmailing you ever since,

607
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:34,293
and you have been paying him off
here on your show

608
00:38:34,328 --> 00:38:36,700
by feeding him the answers.

609
00:38:38,224 --> 00:38:40,348
I knew it.
Do over.

610
00:38:40,383 --> 00:38:43,553
Mr. Birch, you were in Bluestone
valley the night she died.

611
00:38:46,683 --> 00:38:48,976
You must have seen the crash.

612
00:38:54,812 --> 00:38:58,159
She was still alive
when you got to the car.

613
00:38:59,155 --> 00:39:02,025
She had to have said something
to you before she died...

614
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,773
something about Mr. Lankman.

615
00:39:04,808 --> 00:39:08,334
You must have realized
you just hit the jackpot.

616
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:13,986
You called your own answering machine
and recorded her dying words.

617
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:16,453
You can't prove any of this.

618
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:17,838
I was at your house yesterday,

619
00:39:17,873 --> 00:39:20,965
and I happened to hear
the date and time stamp

620
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,598
of a phone message that
you had saved...

621
00:39:24,633 --> 00:39:27,882
May 2nd, 7:39 P. M.

622
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:31,690
I think I can prove it, sir.
What's your number?

623
00:39:31,725 --> 00:39:35,614
Adrian, it's 555-0137.

624
00:39:35,649 --> 00:39:37,265
Thank you, Dwight.

625
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:44,969
Hi, this is your old pal Val.

626
00:39:45,004 --> 00:39:47,226
Leave your message
when you hear the beep.

627
00:39:51,697 --> 00:39:56,073
4, 8, 2.

628
00:39:56,108 --> 00:40:01,634
You have one saved message.
May 2nd, 7:39 P. M.

629
00:40:01,669 --> 00:40:05,634
It was Roddy.
It was Roddy Lankman.

630
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:07,891
He was cheating on the show.

631
00:40:07,926 --> 00:40:10,525
I was going to blow the whistle.

632
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,376
He cut my brakes.

633
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,128
Roddy.

634
00:40:16,139 --> 00:40:17,644
Mr. Lankman, Mr. Birch,

635
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:19,860
some homicide detectives
are outside.

636
00:40:19,895 --> 00:40:21,447
They want to talk to you.

637
00:40:32,569 --> 00:40:33,868
Adrian.

638
00:40:38,826 --> 00:40:40,582
You were amazing.

639
00:40:42,255 --> 00:40:44,413
Just like Trudy always said.

640
00:40:46,921 --> 00:40:48,811
Thank you for this.

641
00:40:50,157 --> 00:40:52,380
Thank you for Trudy.

642
00:41:53,316 --> 00:41:56,911
Monday.
Dear diary, it is a terrible day.

643
00:41:56,946 --> 00:41:59,093
Ginger died this morning.

644
00:41:59,128 --> 00:42:02,026
I was too sad to go to
school or even eat.

645
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,511
I cried all day.

646
00:42:03,546 --> 00:42:05,910
I will never be happy again.

647
00:42:06,708 --> 00:42:08,043
Friday.

648
00:42:08,078 --> 00:42:09,749
Tomorrow I'm going to camp.

649
00:42:09,784 --> 00:42:11,703
I have been packing all day.

650
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:13,629
It's going to be so much fun.

651
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,387
I can't wait.

652
00:42:15,422 --> 00:42:17,635
I still think about Ginger sometimes,

653
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:20,024
but now I just remember the good times.

654
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:21,888
I guess daddy was right.

655
00:42:21,923 --> 00:42:24,014
God wants people to be happy.

656
00:42:24,049 --> 00:42:26,604
Nobody can stay sad forever.
