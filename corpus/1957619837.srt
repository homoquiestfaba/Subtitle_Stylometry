1
00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:04,003
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,854
(thundering)

3
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,794
- [Skeeter] There's this game
 called Virtual Combat right?

4
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,995
It's really cool.

5
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:09,829
- [Josh] Really?

6
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:10,763
- Yeah, it's rad.

7
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:13,132
So what games have you seen?

8
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:16,736
- Oh I saw this game
 called Mortal Ninjas

9
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,037
or something like that.

10
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,272
- Oh really was that cool?

11
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,407
- Yeah, the guys like
 jump around chopping

12
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,176
each other with big old swords--

13
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,811
- Hey there's Debbie Morrow.

14
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,218
- [Debbie] Hi Josh.

15
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,561
- Hi Debbie.

16
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,229
- Hi.

17
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,498
- How are you coming with
  your science assignment?

18
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,700
If you want I can help
you with your homework.

19
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,535
- Come on Josh.

20
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:49,802
- [Debbie] Well maybe.

21
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,271
- You know science
 runs in our family.

22
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,972
My dad works at
 the government lab.

23
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:58,444
- Hey, how's it going
 today boys, huh?

24
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,613
Mmm, who is this
 your girlfriend huh?

25
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,081
This your girlfriend!

26
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:02,982
Your girlfriend!

27
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,189
- I don't have a girlfriend.

28
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,891
- Yeah, never had
 one, never will huh.

29
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,359
So what's your old
  man been up to?

30
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,029
Build any monsters lately
  in the basement huh?

31
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,197
(groaning)

32
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,066
He's gonna build a big ship
 that's gonna go to Mars,

33
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,901
well that's where
  he belongs huh.

34
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:22,835
- [Josh] Ow!

35
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:24,404
- Leave him alone Charlie.

36
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,672
- Huh, what was that?

37
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:26,506
Huy, what you say?

38
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,340
Say it again.

39
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,508
- Get lost!

40
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,577
- Hey go back to
 Arkansas, lizard boy!

41
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,212
Hey forget these guys
 come with me Debbie,

42
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,446
I'll buy you a milkshake.

43
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,084
- Bye Debbie.

44
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,757
- [Skeeter] You
  in trouble again?

45
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,793
- [Josh] Kinda, I
 didn't clean my room

46
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,695
and I didn't make my bed.

47
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,196
- So what's your
 dad working on now?

48
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,431
A death ray.

49
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,267
- Yeah, I wish I could
use it on Johnny Thomas.

50
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,236
- You wanna come over
and play Virtual Combat?

51
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:58,538
It's 32-bit.

52
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,773
- No, I don't think
 my mom will let me.

53
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:03,076
One more mistake
  and I'm grounded.

54
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,546
- Okay, but if you want to
  come over, give me a call.

55
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:07,814
- Okay.

56
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:08,648
See you later.

57
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,767
Mom, I'm home!

58
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:31,804
- What are you doing?

59
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,773
- Getting a cookie.

60
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,607
- One!

61
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,481
What happened to your face?

62
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,315
- Nothing.

63
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:50,056
(telephone ringing)

64
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,191
- [Mom] Hello.
 (dog barking)

65
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,426
- Hey, come here.

66
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:56,562
Hey, hey Cosmo,
  how was your day?

67
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,933
Yeah, you got it made.

68
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:04,203
No mom to boss you around,
  no school, no homework.

69
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,906
No Johnny Thomas.

70
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,210
- Josh your backpack's
 on the counter.

71
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,379
- See what I mean.

72
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:19,519
- Cosmo, get down! Get down!

73
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,021
(dog whining)

74
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,727
Why don't you tell me
 what happened today?

75
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:36,703
Okay, but you can't let those
 guys push you around Josh.

76
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,338
You gotta stand up to 'em.

77
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:41,941
- But he's bigger than I am.

78
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:45,078
- Yeah, well,
 bullies usually are.

79
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,312
They want a fair fight

80
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:48,448
so they pick on kids
 they can win against.

81
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,016
But you can't let 'em win.

82
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,152
- But what if I get hurt?

83
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,822
- Well this hurts doesn't it?

84
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,592
Sweetie, if you don't
 stand up for yourself,

85
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:03,696
you're gonna hurt more
 inside than you do outside.

86
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,800
Look, if you're wrong admit it.

87
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,237
Everybody's wrong sometimes
 and that's when you back down.

88
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:16,609
But if you're right, got to
 stand up for yourself okay?

89
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,014
Feel better?

90
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,118
(doorbell rings)

91
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,452
- Somebody at the door Mom.

92
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,597
- Young man, is
 your mother at home?

93
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:38,898
- Well--

94
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:39,732
- Thank you!

95
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,104
Oh, there you are.

96
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:48,107
- Mrs. Pringle, what
can I do for you today?

97
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:51,377
- It's about that
thing in your backyard.

98
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:54,514
- What were you doing
 in our backyard?

99
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,851
- Oh, I was on a ladder
 cleaning out the rain gutters,

100
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,586
I couldn't help but see.

101
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,088
- (laughing) Of course not.

102
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,991
Well I'm really sorry that
  that device offends you.

103
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,193
Next time why don't
 you have your husband

104
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,694
clean out the rain gutters.

105
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:11,097
- I will take this up with
 the Homeowners Association.

106
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:11,931
Hmmmph!

107
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,535
- Hmmmph.

108
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,103
- What a fruitcake.

109
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,772
- Josh, remember to
 respect your elders,

110
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,641
even if they are
 fruitcakes (laughs).

111
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,585
(light music)

112
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,391
- Earth to Griffin.

113
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,664
Just what are we wasting
  our time on today Griffin?

114
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:45,998
- Well, I uh.

115
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,136
I have this formula that
perfectly replicates

116
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,238
the cellular code
 of any solid matter

117
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,173
with a negative polarity.

118
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:57,009
Um, well, here, watch.

119
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:04,784
Now the fluid will
  act as a magnet.

120
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,023
Right.

121
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:15,862
There we go.

122
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,335
See.

123
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,206
- Interesting Griffin.

124
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:32,111
- Very interesting Dr. Woorter.

125
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,982
- Thank you sir.

126
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,317
And I'm sure you can see
  the military applications

127
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:39,619
of my inventions.

128
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,787
(clearing throat)

129
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,756
- Yes, Professor Griffin?

130
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,425
- Did you have
 something to add Karl?

131
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:51,430
- No, um, no, just something
 stuck in my throat.

132
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,836
- Well, Doctor, this has been
 a very valuable presentation.

133
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,872
- Thank you Colonel Cutter.

134
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,807
- Jerry, call me Jerry.

135
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:03,609
- Jerry.

136
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,615
- [Mom] Then what happened?

137
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,984
- Then he called him Jerry,

138
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,986
like they were all
 friends or something.

139
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,890
- When the colonel was gone
 did you give him a wedgie?

140
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,325
- [Mom] Joshua.

141
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:22,595
- It's your invention you
ought to fight and get it back.

142
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,096
- Josh, adults don't fight.

143
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,032
Fighting only creates chaos.

144
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,800
- Josh has a point honey.

145
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,269
I mean you can't just let Dr.
 Woorter walk all over you.

146
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,871
You've got to stand
 up for yourself.

147
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,407
- What and lose my job!

148
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,742
Honey, honey you
 just don't understand

149
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,110
office politics do you?

150
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,546
What I invent at the lab
is the lab's property.

151
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,014
They own it, they
  make the profits.

152
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,383
- Well then invent
  something at home.

153
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:47,787
I mean you have your own lab
 down in the basement, use it.

154
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,589
- Well I still think you
should have given him a wedgie.

155
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,431
- Cosmo, you eat your own food

156
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,700
and we'll eat our own food okay?

157
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:18,017
- Hmmph, I can't believe
 the neighborhood association

158
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:21,253
allows people like that
to live around here.

159
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,688
- [Mr. Pringle] Mmm hmmm.

160
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:25,358
- No telling what that crackpot
is doing in his basement.

161
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,926
Maybe making a bomb.

162
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:27,827
- Mmmm hmm.

163
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,831
- If he blew up a
 bomb, can you imagine

164
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,867
what that would do to
 property values around here.

165
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,302
- Mmm hmmm.

166
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,604
- Hmmmph, well if the Homeowners
Association isn't going

167
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:41,440
to do anything about him,
  we should go to City Hall.

168
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,241
- Yes dear.

169
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:46,479
- He's back down in
 that basement again.

170
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:52,084
Probably doing
  something immoral.

171
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:05,831
- Honey!

172
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:07,533
Honey!

173
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,503
- Mmm mmm.

174
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,445
(light music)

175
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:50,109
- Well Griffin.

176
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,846
What are we wasting
 our time on today?

177
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,448
- Nothing sir.

178
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,183
- Nothing, that's nice.

179
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:02,354
You know that automatic
shaver you designed.

180
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,989
- Yes sir.

181
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,191
- Well it doesn't work!

182
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,995
If you need me for
 anything, I'll be at lunch.

183
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,903
(chuckling)

184
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,433
- Honey, dinner's ready.

185
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:50,970
- I'll just eat down here okay.

186
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,920
- More sweet potatoes Josh?

187
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,891
- Oh no Mom, I gotta go.

188
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:23,202
- (sighing) Yes, and what
  a nice family dinner.

189
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,250
Here you go.

190
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:41,220
- Oh hi!

191
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,491
I'll just eat that later.

192
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,559
- Yeah, okay.

193
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:22,228
- Yes!

194
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,932
Looks good huh Cosmo?

195
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,136
Cosmo, science dog (laughing).

196
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,076
You wanna help daddy
 with an invention?

197
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,412
Works by changing the
cellular density of the,

198
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,781
ah, you wouldn't
 understand would you?

199
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:43,616
You're a dog!

200
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:46,986
Are you a thirsty dog?

201
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:51,023
It's non-toxic, biodegradable.

202
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,893
Won't hurt you a bit, yeah.

203
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:57,596
There you go,
 that's right Cosmo.

204
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,901
Tastes good, huh.

205
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:03,836
Yeah, yeah.

206
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:16,415
Alright, flop number one.

207
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,183
Science.

208
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:23,489
- Herbert, that Griffin's going
to blow up the neighborhood.

209
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,225
- Mmm, anything you say dear.

210
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,898
- Alright, that might do it.

211
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,835
Here you go, want another drink?

212
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,103
Yeah, you do, don't ya.

213
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:42,574
Uh huh, yeah, ooh
  that tastes good.

214
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,380
Hmmm.

215
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,351
Nothing.

216
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,853
(dog whining)

217
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,360
Oh wow! Wow!

218
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:04,730
(dog barking)

219
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,231
No, stay! Stay!

220
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,666
Cosmo!

221
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,801
You are there aren't you Cosmo?

222
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,868
Stay, stay.

223
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:12,371
Don't! Stay! Stay!

224
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,911
(dog whining)

225
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:22,481
It's okay, come on
  now, it's alright.

226
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:27,186
Good, good, good.

227
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,021
There you go good girl.

228
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,862
Now, Cosmo! Cosmo!

229
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:40,165
We can't tell anyone
 about this yet.

230
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,967
Oh no, no, no, no!

231
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,803
Now you just don't go blabbing
 this around town okay!

232
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,071
(dog barking)

233
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,006
You're gonna have to be
invisible for a few days

234
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:49,908
and then I can patent
 the formula in my name

235
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:53,545
and then I can use the lab
 at work to find the antidote.

236
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:58,517
Till then, this is our
 little secret okay?

237
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,718
(dog barking)

238
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,086
Good girl! Yeah!

239
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,263
- Cosmo! Cosmo!

240
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,503
Hey Mom have you seen Cosmo?

241
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,138
- Uh, no.

242
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,240
- Well she's not
  in the back yard.

243
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,341
- Maybe she's hiding.

244
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,777
- I can't find her anywhere!

245
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,779
- Well, wouldn't
 get upset about it.

246
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,213
She didn't just
  up and disappear,

247
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,615
she's around here somewhere.

248
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,018
- Cosmo! Cosmo!

249
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,062
- My mom is no one.

250
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,465
Sometimes it feels that way.

251
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,408
(dog panting)

252
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,186
- I think Cosmo ran away.

253
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,156
- Oh she's probably
 just out exploring.

254
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:13,759
- Why would she leave?

255
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,961
I was always nice to her.

256
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,798
- Josh, she's around somewhere.

257
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,969
- 'Cause I didn't play
  with her enough, isn't it.

258
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:26,038
She was always bringing me
 her ball wanting me to play.

259
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,240
But I didn't have time for her.

260
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,710
I didn't make time for her

261
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,914
and now she's gone.

262
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,119
- She'll be back honey.

263
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,155
Tired, smiling from
 her adventures,
 waiting for us to look

264
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,958
the other way so she can
snatch some food off the table.

265
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:50,796
- I hope so.

266
00:18:56,702 --> 00:19:00,272
- (sighing) I hope so too.

267
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,180
(music playing on TV)

268
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,220
- [TV Character] How are they
 gonna protect themselves?

269
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,658
- Handguns and rifles,
that's all they'll have.

270
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:24,663
(ominous music) (gunshots)

271
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,168
- Is your room clean?

272
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,102
- Mmm hmm.

273
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,470
- Have you made your bed?

274
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,738
- Mmm hmm.

275
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,640
- Great, thanks.

276
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,808
Don't forget to take
the garbage out tonight.

277
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,155
(gunshot)

278
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,560
(lighthearted music)

279
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,074
(dog whining)

280
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:05,697
- Joshua!

281
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,602
Josh!

282
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,503
- Yes Mom.

283
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:17,643
- Joshua Griffin, you
are grounded for a week.

284
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,778
- But Mom, there's a
 sci-fi double feature

285
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,747
at the Elray theater
 this weekend.

286
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:24,716
- Well I'm really sorry,
  but your room isn't clean.

287
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,218
Your bed isn't made.

288
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,153
- But, but I made my bed.

289
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,021
- Josh!

290
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,992
I'm sorry, but there
 will be no movie-going

291
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:35,260
for you this weekend.

292
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,529
And turn this TV off.

293
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,923
When you finished that, can
 you set the table for me?

294
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:05,724
- Yes Mom.

295
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,393
(Mom gasping)

296
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:10,996
(Dad laughing)

297
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,832
- Oh my!

298
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,201
Oh did we have a good day?

299
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:19,404
- Yes, yes, my ship has come in.

300
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:21,740
- Oh, it's not
  the Titanic is it?

301
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,376
- What does your ship do?

302
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:29,314
- Makes objects invisible.

303
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:31,483
- Oh that's nice honey.

304
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:36,922
- Imagine, imagine,
 invisible eye glasses.

305
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,323
Invisible braces.

306
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:41,626
Invisible bandages,
 invisible anything!

307
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:44,296
Honey, honey we
  are gonna be rich.

308
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,032
We're gonna get rid of the
 old station wagon of yours.

309
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,501
We're gonna maybe move
 to a bigger house.

310
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,703
Maybe take a vacation in Hawaii.

311
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,705
- Oooh! (laughing)

312
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,174
- What kind of vacation
  would it be without Cosmo.

313
00:22:59,111 --> 00:22:59,911
- Cosmo!

314
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,250
The reason is that you haven't
 seen her for the last Week

315
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,253
is because of my experiment.

316
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:15,327
You see I tested the formula
 on her son and Cosmo is uh.

317
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:17,462
I'll just show
 you, just show you.

318
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,231
Cosmo, come here girl!

319
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:21,199
(dog barking)

320
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,033
Come on, come on.

321
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:25,837
There she is.

322
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,006
Formula works on dogs too.

323
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:30,108
- Oh!

324
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:35,213
Oh! (shrieking)

325
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:38,383
Oh my goddess, honey,
 you're a genius.

326
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,686
- You gave me the idea.

327
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:44,222
- Well, can you bring her back.

328
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:46,525
- Oh yeah, yeah sure,
 with an antidote.

329
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,227
- Way to go dad.

330
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:50,695
Hey I'll do the dishes later.

331
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,632
Come on Cosmo!

332
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:58,170
(screaming and laughing)

333
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:04,509
(telephone ringing)

334
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:10,849
- Morning Al.

335
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,301
- So let me get this straight.

336
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,269
Everyone in your family
is totally jazzed

337
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:34,139
'cause your dad invented
this invisibility stuff.

338
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:34,940
- Right.

339
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:39,177
- Cosmo's back but you
 still can't see her.

340
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:40,512
- Right.

341
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,581
- And you're still grounded!

342
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,516
- Right!

343
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:47,085
- Man, what I wouldn't
 give to be invisible.

344
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,620
For just one day.

345
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:52,757
- Well, well, well lookie here.

346
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:57,395
It's lizard boy and
his good friend Dweebo.

347
00:24:57,395 --> 00:25:00,265
Hey guess what Dweebo,
 your girlfriend,

348
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:01,766
she's a little bent out of shape

349
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:04,236
'cause you didn't take her to
 the movie Saturday you know.

350
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:06,371
- So?

351
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:09,074
- So, I think I'm
gonna have to take her.

352
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,810
Maybe I'll give here a
 little kissing, ha, ha, ha.

353
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:29,694
- This place is spooky.

354
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,931
- Well here let me
  turn on the light.

355
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,969
(Skeeter screams)

356
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,205
- Geez, Skeeter,
 it's just a skeleton.

357
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,712
I'm not too sure
 this is a good idea.

358
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:51,383
- Come on Josh, it's the only
 way to sneak past your parents

359
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,685
and save Debbie Morrow
from that Thomas creep.

360
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:18,343
- What if it hurts?

361
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,178
- Did it hurt Cosmo?

362
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,381
- Well, maybe we
 should try it on Ben.

363
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,450
- No, not a good idea.

364
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,421
- Well then, I'm
 not gonna drink it.

365
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:32,057
- Fine, okay.

366
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:38,797
(ominous music)

367
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,893
- [Mom] Josh is that you?

368
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:09,728
- My mom.

369
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:14,799
- [Skeeter] Ben! Ben!

370
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,633
Where'd he go?

371
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:16,568
Where'd he go!

372
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:17,836
- What are you doing down here?

373
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,471
- I'm just showing
  Skeeter Dad's lab.

374
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,440
- Well you know you're not
  supposed to be down here

375
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,309
without your
 father's permission.

376
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,411
- Yes Mom.

377
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:30,615
- You know you're not
 supposed to have company over

378
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:32,417
when you're grounded.

379
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,251
- Yes Mom.

380
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,268
- Sorry to run you off Skeeter.

381
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:56,474
- It's okay Mrs. Griffin, I
 have lots of homework to do.

382
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,179
- [Mom] What am I
gonna do with you Josh?

383
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:04,282
- Sorry Mom.

384
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:07,852
- Go upstairs and
  do your homework.

385
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:13,792
Thank you.

386
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:22,367
(slow dramatic music)

387
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:42,020
- I'm gonna be grounded
for the rest of my life.

388
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:58,470
(gasping)

389
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:04,008
- What!

390
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:09,280
Oh my gosh!

391
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:15,086
Josh! Josh you get in
here right this minute!

392
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,288
I don't believe this.

393
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:19,791
What is going on.

394
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,292
Stay calm.

395
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:24,195
Just wait till your father
 hears about this young man.

396
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,501
Josh, what happened to me?

397
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,470
- Uh, well.

398
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:36,107
Uh Skeeter and I
 had this plan and--

399
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,676
- Josh, look at me!

400
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:44,048
- I'm trying, but
  you're not there.

401
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:49,154
- Okay, let's start with
breaking into your father's lab.

402
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:51,456
- Okay, I broke into the lab

403
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,925
and borrowed some of dad's
  invisibility formula.

404
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:54,993
- Joshua!

405
00:29:56,794 --> 00:30:01,799
- Okay, I stole some of the
invisibility formula so that...

406
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:07,872
and I put in the RC bottle
  and I guess you drank it.

407
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,806
- Why?

408
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:12,410
- Because you were thirsty.

409
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,113
- Why did you steal the formula?

410
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,615
- So, so I could sneak
 out of the house.

411
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:20,952
See, 'cause this, 'cause
 this guy named Johnny Thomas

412
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,921
he was gonna--

413
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:26,624
- Oh young man you wait
 till your father gets home!

414
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:29,093
- Sorry mom.

415
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:31,796
- Hi honey, I'm home.

416
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:34,966
Honey?

417
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:37,268
(Mom sobbing)

418
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:38,069
Honey?

419
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:41,639
What's wrong?

420
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,577
- Look at me Karl,
  just look at me!

421
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:49,948
- Hey, hey there's
  no reason to cry.

422
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:53,251
I mean underneath all that
  stuff you're beautiful.

423
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:57,689
- Underneath all this stuff
 I'm invisible! (sobbing)

424
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:01,693
- What!

425
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,895
- Josh broke into your lab
 and stole some of the formula

426
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:07,332
and I drank it by mistake
  and now I'm invisible.

427
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:08,600
- Oh my god!

428
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,768
It works on people too.

429
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:14,505
I mean this is so much
  more than I ever imagined.

430
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,174
Tell me, how does it feel?

431
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:17,642
Tingly?

432
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,011
Is your vision blurred
  or is it darkened at all?

433
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,246
- Karl!

434
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:23,648
Am I gonna look
  like this forever?

435
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,084
- Now did you say
 that Josh did this.

436
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,686
- Yes and as soon as
you give me the antidote

437
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:29,887
I'm gonna kill him.

438
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,225
- Honey, I don't
 know how to say this.

439
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,128
- Say what!

440
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,099
- There is no antidote.

441
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,369
- What!

442
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,404
- Not yet at least.

443
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:50,241
- So?

444
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:55,213
- So, so, I didn't have time
 to develop an antidote yet.

445
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,515
- Yet!

446
00:31:57,515 --> 00:32:01,452
- Honey now you may
have to remain invisible

447
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:03,588
until I sell them the formula.

448
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,422
- Hah!

449
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,458
Forget it!

450
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,826
- That's not gonna
 work for you is it?

451
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,166
- Oh, this is ridiculous.

452
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,568
Karl, you've got to
 find an antidote.

453
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:21,105
If you have to sneak around
 to do it, sneak around.

454
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:25,510
- Okay, okay, I'll just have
 to smuggle the formula in,

455
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,911
make the antidote

456
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:29,714
and hope that Dr.
  Woorter doesn't catch me.

457
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,449
- Well that'll be easy.

458
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,985
- It would be easier
if I had a test subject

459
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:36,154
so that I could make
sure the antidote works.

460
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,522
- What about Cosmo?

461
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:39,290
(dog barking)

462
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,958
- Cosmo's too big.

463
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:42,193
I'm gonna have enough trouble

464
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:43,594
getting the formula
 past Woorter without--

465
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:44,429
- Ben!

466
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:47,432
Ben, Skeeter's lizard,
 he's invisible too.

467
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,077
- Well, what have we
got going here Griffin?

468
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,913
- Oh, um, this is the a,

469
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:06,050
my kinetic energy experiment
 that I have been working on.

470
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,518
You know.

471
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:09,654
- Oh well, now that
you've brought it here,

472
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,656
it's our property right?

473
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:15,693
- Oh, of course.

474
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:20,698
You know, but I need the
computer to run a few equations

475
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:23,267
then you can have the
 wheel for analysis.

476
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:24,435
- Certainly, certainly.

477
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,515
- Right.

478
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,388
Okay, come on, come on.

479
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,662
Yes, alright now,
formulate the antidote.

480
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,868
- The antidote to what Griffin?

481
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,668
- My formula.

482
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:05,710
- And just what does this
  new formula of ours do?

483
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,648
Invisibility, hmmm.

484
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:15,420
I feel a promotion coming
  on, for myself naturally.

485
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,890
- Dr. Woorter,
 this is my formula.

486
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,159
Now I developed this
 myself on my own time.

487
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,394
- On your own time,
 but in our laboratory

488
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,662
with our computer.

489
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:27,331
- Well, not exactly.

490
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:30,134
- You know that's
 grounds for dismissal.

491
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:33,337
- No, Dr. Woorter,
 you don't understand.

492
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:35,406
- Oh yes, I understand.

493
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,942
And I think that I'm
going to confiscate this

494
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:39,544
for the good of mankind.

495
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:44,248
And I don't think that
  sending this off right now

496
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,117
is such a good idea.

497
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:51,289
- You realize what would happen

498
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,891
if this falls into
 the wrong... hands.

499
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:55,927
Oh my god.

500
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,405
- Get me security, fast.

501
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,679
- Dr. Woorter! Dr. Woorter!

502
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,682
You can't do this.

503
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:21,686
- Sorry Griffin, but as
of 3.07 this afternoon,

504
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:25,022
you are barred from
 this lab for life.

505
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:27,258
- You don't understand, my wife!

506
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,559
- Oh yes, your wife.

507
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,228
Well, looks like
 she's gonna have to

508
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:31,696
find another job now huh?

509
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,065
So will you for that matter.

510
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:38,269
Can you say, would you like
 fries with your burger?

511
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:42,206
- Dr. Woorter, please, I
 must have access to the lab.

512
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:43,808
- Bye bye.

513
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,642
- No! No!

514
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:57,522
- Oh great, it's in code.

515
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:02,793
It's alright, I can
 break it, I think.

516
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:11,002
My new formula.

517
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,404
- And just what do
  you think it does.

518
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:18,376
- Well sir, imagine if
  you can, an invisible army

519
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:21,512
capable of crossing enemy
 lines and attacking at will.

520
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:26,017
Past guards, past surveillance
 cameras, without being seen.

521
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,618
- Science fiction Doctor.

522
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:28,619
- Science fact.

523
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:32,857
- Empty cage, or is it?

524
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:42,433
- Seems like some
 kind of trick to me.

525
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:45,136
Empty cage with a
  motorized wheel.

526
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:46,137
- It's no trick sir.

527
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,640
It's an invisible lab specimen.

528
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:55,746
I'm telling you, inside of
 this cage is an invisible...

529
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:58,516
Something or other.

530
00:36:58,516 --> 00:36:59,584
- Something or other?

531
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:04,322
- Sir, whoever
  owns this formula,

532
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,457
is going to rule the world.

533
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:08,459
- If you can prove this Doctor,

534
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:12,263
you're gonna be a
 very, very rich man.

535
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:16,534
Now as soon as you can get
  me a valid lab specimen,

536
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,469
I'll show it to the boys in D.C.

537
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:27,612
- What are you? A rat?

538
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:33,451
(light music)

539
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,127
- Mom, you home?

540
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:58,976
Aaargh!

541
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:00,544
- [Mom] Not until after dinner.

542
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:02,847
- Mom, don't sneak
 up on me like that!

543
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:05,783
- [Mom] Well don't
sneak cookies like that.

544
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,652
- Mom, you don't
 have any clothes on!

545
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,688
Or at least I
 don't think you do.

546
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,922
- [Mom] Is your bed made?

547
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,393
- Mom, where are you?

548
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,128
- [Mom] Watching
your every move.

549
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:26,003
(knocking)

550
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,043
(knocking)

551
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:37,948
- Hiya doing Griff?

552
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:40,418
Go get your mommy, I'm
 collecting for the Tribune.

553
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:43,321
- How much?

554
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,323
- 12 bucks, plus a generous
 tip you little twerp.

555
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:52,096
- Mom, it's the paper boy
  and he needs 12 dollars.

556
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,432
- [Mom] My purse is
 on the coffee table.

557
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:55,266
- Wait here.

558
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,044
Mom, you've only got 10 dollars.

559
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:09,580
- I'll take a check.

560
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:25,496
Hey Griff, by the way, I'm
  taking that girl you like

561
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:27,365
out to the movies
  Saturday night.

562
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,101
Too bad you can't
 make it huh? (laughs)

563
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,943
- She already had one
 filled out for you.

564
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:39,877
- What and no tip.

565
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,415
Hey that nose of yours is
 looking pretty good there huh.

566
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:47,184
Ready for another pop! (laughs)

567
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:49,653
Ow!

568
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:53,124
Ow!

569
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:58,929
Man, what is that?

570
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:03,567
- Didn't I tell you
 I was telekinetic?

571
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,735
- Huh?

572
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,837
- I can move things
 with my mind.

573
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:08,439
- Ow!

574
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,040
What are you talking about?

575
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,976
- It's one of my
  dad's experiments.

576
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:16,514
You lay one hand on Debbie and
 I'll make your head explode.

577
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:17,448
I can do it!

578
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,622
- [Mom] Look at that boy run!

579
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:27,458
- Thanks Mom!

580
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:28,826
- [Mom] No sweat kiddo.

581
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:00,224
Hi honey, did you get it?

582
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:01,525
Did you find the answer?

583
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,894
What's the matter?

584
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:06,430
- I got fired.

585
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,766
- [Mom] (gasps) You what?

586
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:09,800
- Fired from the lab.

587
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,005
No chemicals, no super computer.

588
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:17,575
- No antidote.

589
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,443
- Dr. Woorter
confiscated the formula

590
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:20,678
and barred me from the lab.

591
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:24,448
- Karl, I can't stay
 invisible forever!

592
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:27,685
- I don't know what to do.

593
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:29,486
- Oh.

594
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:39,363
- Something is wrong Herbert.

595
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:41,298
- Yes dear.

596
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:43,834
- I haven't seen
 Laura Griffin all day

597
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,736
and goodness knows
  I've been looking.

598
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:48,706
It's as though she's
just up and disappeared.

599
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,976
(sad music)

600
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,404
- Dad, you can't let those
  guys push you around.

601
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:23,340
You've got to stand
 up for yourself.

602
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:27,211
- He's my boss Josh.

603
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:30,381
He's more important than I am.

604
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,950
- But he didn't invent
 the formula, you did.

605
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,385
You're the genius dad.

606
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:39,056
He may be your boss but
  you're smarter than he is.

607
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,457
You can't let him win.

608
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,493
- He fired me!

609
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,361
It's over!

610
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:45,829
I lost!

611
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:49,066
- You can't give up just
because you're hurt.

612
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,068
You've got to keep going.

613
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,803
If you don't stand up for
  yourself, you'll be hurt

614
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:54,805
on the inside as well
 as on the outside.

615
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:59,009
It's your formula Dad.

616
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:04,748
You have the right to break
 into the lab and get it back.

617
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,450
If you find out the
antidote in the process

618
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,384
it's even better.

619
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:09,320
- You make it sound easy.

620
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,187
- It will be.

621
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:13,023
We've got to take the chance.

622
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,458
- I've still got my keys.

623
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,795
They're closed on Saturday.

624
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:23,334
If I can get past the
 guard at the desk.

625
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:24,535
- We can do it.

626
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:26,537
We've got to get
 Mom back to normal.

627
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:39,383
- [Security Guard] Dr. Griffin,
what are you doing back?

628
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:41,819
- We're here to
  clean out my desk.

629
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:43,721
- Mmm hmm.

630
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:53,464
- Just be cool.

631
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,665
Right here.

632
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:57,167
(tense music)

633
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:03,807
Alright, here we go.

634
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:09,079
- This is a pretty
  cool place Dad.

635
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,415
- Thanks.

636
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:12,683
We got to hurry though.

637
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:27,331
(telephone ringing)

638
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:32,236
- Woorter here.

639
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,741
No I didn't give
 Griffin permission to
 collect his things.

640
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:39,109
How long has he been there?

641
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:42,312
No, no, no, don't
  call the police.

642
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:43,814
I'll take care of this myself.

643
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:51,422
- Alright, alright,
 this better work.

644
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:58,996
Now this I believe is the
ingredient that we were missing.

645
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:04,768
Yeah, yeah.

646
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:05,602
Huh.

647
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:06,603
- Let's try that on Ben.

648
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:07,438
- Let's try.

649
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:17,047
Here you go Ben.

650
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,115
There you go.

651
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:24,154
I've learned a
 valuable lesson son.

652
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,391
I should have thought
 before I acted.

653
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:31,862
Once Mom's back I'm gonna
  destroy the formula.

654
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:34,398
Shred every trace, it's
just too dangerous.

655
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,233
The world's not ready yet.

656
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,701
Look what it's done to us.

657
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:39,670
- It's okay, you
didn't know Dad.

658
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:40,771
- Maybe I should have.

659
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:46,643
(dreamy music)

660
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:50,080
Yes, yes!

661
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,081
It works! It works!

662
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:53,884
- Mom's gonna be okay.

663
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:57,020
- [Dr. Woorter] I'm
 so happy to hear that.

664
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:00,424
- Run! Run!

665
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:03,327
(fast paced music)

666
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:12,002
- Restrain him will you, he
 just ruined my experiment.

667
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:17,908
- Dr. Woorter, Dr.
Woorter, I can explain.

668
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:21,078
My wife has disappeared.

669
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:22,646
I have to get her back.

670
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:24,581
- Your wife disappeared?

671
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:25,415
- [Dad] Yes.

672
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,153
- And so that made
 you break into my lab.

673
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:32,389
- Yes! I needed certain
 chemicals to make an antidote

674
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:33,223
to bring her back.

675
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:34,057
She's invisible.

676
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:35,025
- Invisible!

677
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:35,926
Did you hear that?

678
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,830
I believe he said
 that she's invisible.

679
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:44,668
I think that you'd better
 call the state mental hospital

680
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:46,870
and have them come
 and get Prof. Griffin.

681
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:49,506
- My god, didn't
  you just hear me?

682
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:50,874
My wife is at home, she's
  there waiting for me.

683
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:51,842
She's invisible.

684
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:53,277
You can't do this.

685
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:56,747
- So, you decided to try
 this experiment on your wife?

686
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,885
- Look, just let me go.

687
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:05,289
Let me go Woorter and I'll
 split the formula with you.

688
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:07,858
- Oh, there's no
  reason to do that.

689
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:10,260
You see Griffin, once
 the competency hearing

690
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,496
finds you mentally unstable.

691
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,898
Well, they're gonna
 lock you up for life.

692
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:18,101
Then the formula will
 be mine, all mine.

693
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:19,336
Take him away.

694
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:26,310
So, that's who you are.

695
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:43,160
- Listen, you've got
 to let me out of here.

696
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,463
My dad isn't crazy, my
mom really is invisible.

697
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:49,733
It's my fault really.

698
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:52,436
I'm the one who gave
 her my dad's formula.

699
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,505
Look, my dad isn't crazy.

700
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,475
You believe me don't you.

701
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,286
- Aha, you got him huh?

702
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:12,389
Well dementia seems
 to run in the family.

703
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,291
Better get a child
 custody officer here

704
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:16,693
to take care of little Joshua.

705
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:19,096
Put him in a home for
  disturbed little children.

706
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:25,435
As for you Griffin, I see
 basket-weaving in your future.

707
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:29,006
Lots and lots of basket-weaving.

708
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:30,207
- Didn't you hear what I said.

709
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,775
YOu've got to believe
 me I'm not crazy.

710
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:35,212
My wife is really
  invisible, really.

711
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:36,046
Let me out.

712
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:38,815
Help!

713
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:40,484
Somebody help! No! No!

714
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:42,552
You don't understand.

715
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:44,688
I'm the only one who
 knows how to help her.

716
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:46,857
(yelling)

717
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:52,429
Help!

718
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:56,533
Help me!

719
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:01,104
- Rats.

720
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:06,877
The only proof that the
 formula really works, ruined.

721
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:09,179
Thanks a lot pal.

722
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:15,852
All I need now is just
 another invisible specimen.

723
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:20,791
Yeah, something that would
  sway the joint chiefs

724
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,492
to pay me twice what I want.

725
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:24,761
What?

726
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,198
Wait a minute.

727
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,235
The mother, Mrs. Griffin.

728
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:34,805
Of course!

729
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:38,575
(ominous music)

730
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:57,828
There, she'll never
 know the difference.

731
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:05,469
Perfect.

732
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:18,915
- [Mom] Gosh you guys
it's after five o'clock.

733
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:20,050
Where are you?

734
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,618
You said you wouldn't
 be this late.

735
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,760
- [Josh] Well don't I at
least get a phone call.

736
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,561
- [Woman] Alright
  but make it quick.

737
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,404
(telephone ringing)

738
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:44,040
- [Mom] Oh finally,
this has got to be them.

739
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:50,313
Hello.

740
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:51,615
- Mom.

741
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:53,083
- [Mom] Where are
  you, are you okay?

742
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,051
- Well we ran into a
  little trouble at the lab.

743
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:56,953
Dr. Woorter caught us.

744
00:50:56,953 --> 00:50:58,522
They put me in this orphanage.

745
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:00,357
- [Mom] Orphanage!

746
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:01,558
- Yeah, until the hearing.

747
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,194
- [Mom] What hearing?

748
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:05,862
- Dad's sanity hearing.

749
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:07,364
They've got him
  in the loony bin.

750
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:08,565
- [Mom] What!

751
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,766
- Dr. Woorter convinced
them that he's crazy

752
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:11,501
because he thinks
 that you're invisible.

753
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:13,036
- [Mom] Well, where
 is this hearing.

754
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:15,338
- No Mom, you can't go there.

755
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:17,607
Dad thinks the formula
 is too dangerous.

756
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:20,877
You can't let anybody know
 that the invisibility works.

757
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:22,679
- [Mom] What else can I do?

758
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:25,482
- Well Dad's hearing's on Monday
morning nine o'clock sharp.

759
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:27,651
You gotta think of something.

760
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:28,652
- [Mom] I will.

761
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:29,586
- That's enough.

762
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,154
- Just a minute.

763
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:33,123
- [Mom] Josh! Josh!

764
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:35,725
- Mom.

765
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:36,893
- [Mom] Yeah?

766
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:37,961
- I love you.

767
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:39,696
- [Mom] I love you too.

768
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:43,467
- Alright, come with me.

769
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:53,009
- [Mom] Alright,
  Laura, stay calm.

770
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:56,046
Stay calm and you can get
 everything straightened out.

771
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:59,816
(mumbling)

772
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,921
Poor Karl, he must be so upset.

773
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:09,259
What could be keeping that cab.

774
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:11,862
I have to get to the lab before
Prof. Woorter gets there.

775
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:13,964
If I can just get to Karl's lab,

776
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,299
I can find the antidote
for this somewhere.

777
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:19,936
I can't believe it's
taking that cab so long.

778
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:24,574
Oh, my gosh I'm gonna
 die in this outfit.

779
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:26,243
Must be 100 degrees.

780
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:30,614
Josh, I never wanted
 this to happen to him.

781
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:35,185
Don't worry family,
 Mom will pull through.

782
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:39,956
(lighthearted music)

783
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:53,870
(taxi hooting)

784
00:52:58,141 --> 00:52:58,942
At last.

785
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:08,718
- Where to lady?

786
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:11,254
- Applied Technologies lab.

787
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:12,923
- [Driver] Want
  me to step on it?

788
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:17,360
- Here's a twenty, it should
 cover the fare and your tip.

789
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,429
- You feeling okay lady?

790
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:20,797
- Just get going.

791
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:21,631
- Okay.

792
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,485
Here you go lady,
  safe and sound.

793
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:45,155
- Thank goodness, I
 could not have stayed

794
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:47,457
inside these clothes
 one more minute.

795
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:49,559
It's pretty hot in
 here, you know that.

796
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:53,263
Just got to get
  these things off.

797
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:56,366
Then I got to get in, I've
  got to get past the guards

798
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:57,834
without being seen.

799
00:53:57,834 --> 00:54:00,303
When I find that Dr.
  Woorter, what he did to me

800
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:02,339
I'm gonna give him
 one swift kick in the.

801
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:06,643
I don't believe I'm taking
  my clothes off in public.

802
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:07,877
Broad daylight.

803
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:12,249
Excuse me, what are
 you looking at buddy!

804
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:13,883
Thanks for the ride.

805
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:17,454
- Have a nice day.

806
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:18,288
- [Mom] You too.

807
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:32,102
- Before we make a presentation
to the joint chiefs

808
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:35,605
I need proof
 Woorter, solid proof.

809
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,173
- Oh you'll have your proof sir.

810
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:39,342
Just as soon as I
 can secure a specimen

811
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:41,778
for my show and
  tell presentation.

812
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:44,147
- And just how long do
  you think it will take you

813
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:46,816
to secure this specimen?

814
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:47,984
- [Mom] Excuse me.

815
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:55,191
- I think that I'll have one
 very soon sir, very soon.

816
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:02,666
- [Mom] I know the antidote
 must be around here somewhere.

817
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:05,235
Oh, hi Ben.

818
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:06,569
Where could it be?

819
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:07,904
What does it look like?

820
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:09,639
Oh! That's not it.

821
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:11,474
Maybe over here.

822
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:14,511
Wait a minute, that's it!

823
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:19,949
(shrieking) Help! Help!

824
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:21,017
Let me out of here!

825
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:22,719
Let me out!

826
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:24,554
- Well, good evening
 Mrs. Griffin.

827
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:29,092
Nice to see you, or not to
 see you as the case may be.

828
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:29,993
- [Mom] Let me go!

829
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:35,098
- I wish you'd stop
  struggling so much though.

830
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:38,134
I'm afraid you
 might hurt yourself.

831
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:39,602
- [Mom] Let me go!

832
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:42,572
- Oh, I'm afraid
I can't do that.

833
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:44,074
You see Mrs. Griffin.

834
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:48,545
Well you are dramatic proof
 that the invisible formula

835
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:50,447
really works on humans.

836
00:55:51,881 --> 00:55:55,118
Now, after your poor husband
 is found mentally unstable

837
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:58,154
and committed to an asylum.

838
00:55:58,154 --> 00:56:03,026
I will use you as part of my
 presentation in Washington.

839
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:06,262
You will help me
 to sell the formula

840
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:09,165
to the government for millions.

841
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:11,167
- [Mom] I won't
  help you Woorter.

842
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:14,571
- Oh yes, I think you
 will Mrs. Griffin.

843
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:19,576
You see, well if you co-operate,
well then I will supply you

844
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:23,513
with the antidote, which
you came so close to.

845
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:26,649
And also your husband and
  your son will be released.

846
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:29,819
Now if you choose
  not to co-operate.

847
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:33,289
Oh dear, I sure hate to
see families separated

848
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:38,294
but I'm sure that you understand
that business is business.

849
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,564
- [Mom] You promise you'll
 release my husband and son.

850
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,299
- Scout's honor.

851
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:48,104
Just stay quiet until we
 get to Washington, alright.

852
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:50,140
Now, if you'll excuse me,

853
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:53,042
I will go and prepare
your room for the trip.

854
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:03,419
Well, I hope you'll like
your room Mrs. Griffin.

855
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:05,555
- [Mom] Oh it's
  swell, real swell.

856
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:07,924
Just, remember to
 keep your mouth shut

857
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,126
until we get to
 Washington D.C. huh.

858
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:12,328
- [Mom] I heard
 you the first time.

859
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:16,399
- Anything you
  say can jeopardize

860
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:19,068
the future well-being
 of your family.

861
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:20,069
- [Mom] I know that.

862
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:25,975
- Oh, here's something
 to think about.

863
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:26,910
- [Mom] Ow!

864
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:31,881
You're not gonna get
away with this Woorter.

865
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:36,252
(lightning crashes)

866
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:47,831
- What are you thinking about?

867
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:48,665
- My mom.

868
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:51,601
- I used to think
  that having a mom

869
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:54,370
was the worst thing
 in the whole world.

870
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:57,640
Even worse than head-lice.

871
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:02,412
But then my mom went
 away, never came back.

872
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:06,950
- I'm sorry.

873
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,284
- It's okay.

874
00:58:08,284 --> 00:58:10,386
What happened to your mom?

875
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,424
- I don't know.

876
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:19,329
- You should get some sleep.

877
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:28,338
(sad music)

878
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:37,513
(lightning crashes)

879
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:54,030
- [Mom] Hey guys, I'm
 sorry I let you down.

880
00:58:55,531 --> 00:58:58,234
I promise we'll be a
  family again really soon.

881
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:02,572
I love you. (crying)

882
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:12,882
- I can't sleep.

883
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:19,055
I'm worried about
 my wife and my son.

884
00:59:25,695 --> 00:59:29,899
Funny, I haven't worried
  about them in a long time.

885
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:36,973
I'm usually busy doing
 unimportant things.

886
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:42,312
Now it may be too late.

887
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:48,584
(crying)

888
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:08,104
- [Mom] Oh I don't want
to go to Washington.

889
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,439
- Well Lenny, this is the one.

890
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,440
Come on let's get
  it on the truck.

891
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,275
It's almost nine a.m.

892
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,142
- [Mom] Nine a.m!

893
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,546
- I heard you the first time.

894
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:17,747
- I didn't say anything.

895
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:19,949
I gotta get some sleep.

896
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:20,783
Come on.

897
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:26,756
- Geez, this thing's heavy.

898
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:28,257
- It must weigh a ton.

899
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:31,060
- [Mom] Excuse me, I don't
  weigh an ounce over 112.

900
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:36,432
- Did you hear that?

901
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,344
- Nothing in there,
 but a picture.

902
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:49,579
- [Mom] Hey, no peeking.

903
01:00:58,554 --> 01:00:59,355
- Smitty!

904
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:04,794
- [Mom] Sleep tight.

905
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:09,132
Sorry guys, but
  sometimes a mom's

906
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:10,566
got to play a little tough.

907
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:28,985
- Morning, sleep well?

908
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:31,287
- Listen, you have no
reason to keep me here.

909
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:32,722
I am not insane.

910
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:34,757
- Ah, that's what they all say.

911
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:37,760
- [Dad] But I'm not like the
 others, I really am sane.

912
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,462
- That's what the hearing's for.

913
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:40,663
- To prove I'm sane.

914
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:43,166
- No, to prove that
 you belong here.

915
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:44,700
Come on, haven't got all day.

916
01:01:57,246 --> 01:01:59,816
- Oh sir, sir, I think
 that in the interests

917
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:01,584
of national security
  that we shouldn't mention

918
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:03,686
the invisibility
formula at this hearing.

919
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:06,255
- Well at this point, I'm not
 sure there is such a thing.

920
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:07,490
- Oh yeah, there is, there is!

921
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:09,659
Wait till you see the
 new specimen I have.

922
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:28,277
- The board acknowledges
Colonel Cutter.

923
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:34,750
- Well Professor Griffin
  was always a strange bird.

924
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:37,487
Not exactly the kind of man
 you would expect to find

925
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:38,321
in the army.

926
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:43,626
Men like me, strong, courageous,

927
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:47,230
with a love for
dressing up in uniform.

928
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:52,034
A love for living
  with other men.

929
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:59,008
In other words, he was not what
you would call a man's man.

930
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:00,810
- Like yourself Colonel.

931
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:02,378
- Well thank you ma'am.

932
01:03:02,378 --> 01:03:03,813
Yes exactly.

933
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:08,417
He was always cowering in
 the corner during briefings.

934
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:10,987
Strange bird.

935
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:13,289
- I see, is that all?

936
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:17,093
- I think that about covers
 the situation ma'am yes.

937
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:17,927
- Thank you.

938
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:27,470
- Is there a Mrs.
  Pringle present.

939
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,473
- Oh, yes I'm right
 here your honor.

940
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,608
- I'm not a judge,
  I am a doctor.

941
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:35,678
I understand you have some
 information to share with us.

942
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:36,913
- Yes, your honor.

943
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:38,781
- Mrs. Pringle please
 take the stand.

944
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:50,893
- Professor Griffin and
 his wife and son have lived

945
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:54,163
across the street
 from me for 11 years.

946
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:59,969
If you ask me, he
 was never quite sane.

947
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:04,774
And then, suddenly last
 week, his wife disappeared.

948
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:07,376
Hmmph, just up and vanished.

949
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:12,348
I think he killed her
and cut her up in pieces

950
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:14,183
and buried them all
 over the back yard.

951
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:16,185
I bet if you would get
 some men with shovels

952
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:17,587
they could dig her up.

953
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:20,189
- Thank you, that
  will be enough.

954
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:27,730
- Hey son.

955
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:30,233
- Don't worry, you're
 gonna get out of this.

956
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:31,667
- I know, I know.

957
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:34,837
- Hey buddy, keep your distance.

958
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:36,138
This guy's a psycho.

959
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:37,106
- He's my dad!

960
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:38,507
- Just keep your distance.

961
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:44,614
- [Doctor] Professor
 Griffin please.

962
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:48,651
- Good luck.

963
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,835
- My name is Karl
  Jackson Griffin

964
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,439
and there has been
  a mistake made.

965
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:16,145
As a research scientist for
Applied Technologies Laboratory

966
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,349
I created an
 invisibility formula.

967
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:26,722
Then, due to a
mistake, my wife Laura,

968
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:31,260
drank some of the formula
  and she became invisible.

969
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:37,733
And then Dr. Woorter stole
  the invisibility formula

970
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,337
and he fired me.

971
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:44,307
When I attempted to break into
 the lab to create an antidote

972
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:46,042
so that my wife
 could be seen again,

973
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:48,878
Dr. Woorter had me arrested.

974
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:53,182
Here I am now.

975
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,719
Dr. Woorter is the one
 who should be on trial

976
01:05:56,719 --> 01:06:00,189
for stealing my formula.

977
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,693
- This is not a trial,
 it is a hearing.

978
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:11,000
- Okay, then hear this.

979
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:17,740
I love my wife
  and I love my son.

980
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:23,779
I love my family and
 I also love my job.

981
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:29,652
And I won't go on working
  with disreputable people

982
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:32,288
like Dr. Woorter, who
steal the work of others

983
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:34,323
and claim it as their own.

984
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,297
That's enough to drive
anybody a little crazy.

985
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:48,838
For years, I did nothing.

986
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:53,809
I let him steal from me,
 afraid that he would fire me.

987
01:06:58,447 --> 01:07:01,050
Well I, I can't do that anymore.

988
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:08,324
I am not gonna let bullies like
Dr. Woorter push me around,

989
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:13,162
claim that he invented my
formula and say that I am crazy.

990
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:14,597
Dr. Woorter is a thief.

991
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:19,535
He's the one who should
be on trial, not me.

992
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:21,771
- This is not a trial.

993
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:22,838
It's a hearing.

994
01:07:24,006 --> 01:07:26,008
Thank you Dr. Griffin,
 you may take a seat.

995
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:34,183
So let's hear what Dr.
 Woorter has to say.

996
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:47,763
- Well first of all, let me
 assure you that I'm no thief.

997
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:54,403
Now, I'm sorry to have
  to be the one to say this

998
01:07:55,805 --> 01:08:00,443
but Professor Griffin has
  clearly lost his mind.

999
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:05,114
I mean invisibility, come on.

1000
01:08:05,114 --> 01:08:06,782
We all know that
 there's no such thing

1001
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:10,286
as an invisibility formula.

1002
01:08:10,286 --> 01:08:12,721
And as for his wife
 being invisible.

1003
01:08:12,721 --> 01:08:14,723
She disappeared all
 right, she took off!

1004
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:17,793
I mean otherwise
  she would be here.

1005
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:21,263
And as you can plainly
 see-- (slapping)

1006
01:08:25,334 --> 01:08:28,103
She's not.

1007
01:08:28,103 --> 01:08:29,472
- Glad you could
 make it sweetheart.

1008
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:36,612
- Oh it's a little warm in here.

1009
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:41,617
Now, seems to me that
 Professor Griffin should not

1010
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:46,722
be allowed to interact with
fellow human beings like myself.

1011
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:49,859
(grunting)

1012
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:54,697
Stop that!

1013
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:56,532
Stop that immediately.

1014
01:08:57,533 --> 01:08:58,367
Stop that!

1015
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:00,636
Excuse me.

1016
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:09,445
Furthermore, I believe
 that Professor Griffin

1017
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,682
should be committed to the
 state mental health facility

1018
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:16,185
because-- (giggling)

1019
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:18,153
Stop that tickling!

1020
01:09:18,153 --> 01:09:18,988
Stop that!

1021
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:21,790
- Do you see anybody?

1022
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:24,193
- No, of course not.

1023
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:24,994
Do you?

1024
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:29,832
- Man's obviously crazy.

1025
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,568
- That's not true,
  I'm not crazy.

1026
01:09:32,568 --> 01:09:34,136
It's her, don't you understand.

1027
01:09:34,136 --> 01:09:35,538
Can't you see?

1028
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:36,906
Of course you can't see.

1029
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:37,840
That's because she's invisible.

1030
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,942
But believe me she's there.

1031
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:42,011
She's the one that made me
 pick my nose, she slapped me.

1032
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,446
She's been tickling-- (yelling)

1033
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:45,814
She's trying to
 make me look crazy.

1034
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:47,550
I'm not, I'm not crazy.

1035
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:49,718
- That's what they all say.

1036
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:54,456
(Woorter yelling)

1037
01:09:58,594 --> 01:09:59,929
- Everybody wave
  your arms around.

1038
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:01,764
You'll hit her, you'll hit her.

1039
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:04,266
I'm telling you I'm not crazy.

1040
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:10,639
- I'd say that this
 hearing is over.

1041
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:12,508
Professor Griffin,
  you're free to go.

1042
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:17,813
And I'd like to see a
  full report on Dr. Woorter

1043
01:10:17,813 --> 01:10:19,048
tomorrow morning.

1044
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,683
See that he doesn't
 hurt himself.

1045
01:10:27,289 --> 01:10:29,625
- Honey! Honey?

1046
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:30,726
- Professor Griffin.

1047
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:34,096
It looks like we're gonna have

1048
01:10:34,096 --> 01:10:36,165
a vacancy at Applied
 Technologies.

1049
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:41,637
- You want me to take my
old job back after this?

1050
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:45,107
- No I wouldn't think of
 giving you your old job back.

1051
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:47,376
How would you like
  Dr. Woorter's job?

1052
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:50,045
- What?

1053
01:10:50,045 --> 01:10:51,413
- What we're looking
 for is a leader.

1054
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:53,816
A man who isn't afraid
to stand up for himself.

1055
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:56,986
So do you want the job?

1056
01:11:00,255 --> 01:11:01,290
- Yeah.

1057
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:03,492
I mean, yes sir.

1058
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:06,996
And there are gonna be some
 big changes around here

1059
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:09,498
and I have got plenty
 of ideas Colonel.

1060
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:15,337
- Jerry, call me Jerry.

1061
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:18,874
And if I were you I'd take
  that wife of yours out

1062
01:11:18,874 --> 01:11:20,309
and celebrate tonight.

1063
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:22,711
I don't think you would've
gotten out of this without her.

1064
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:23,946
- Oh you're right.

1065
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:25,781
You know if it's not
 too much trouble,

1066
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:30,185
have the invisibility antidote
 sent over from the lab.

1067
01:11:30,185 --> 01:11:31,687
- I'll do that right away sir.

1068
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:38,294
- Well, congratulations
neighbors.

1069
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:42,464
Oh!

1070
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:44,166
Why I never.

1071
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:50,039
Hmmph.

1072
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:52,741
- [Mom] Oh, I've wanted
to do that for so long.

1073
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:53,542
- There you are.

1074
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:57,446
So, where to now?

1075
01:11:57,446 --> 01:11:58,247
- [Mom] Home!

1076
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:03,819
- You are some woman.

1077
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:06,055
- [Mom] You wouldn't
 believe what happened to me.

1078
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:07,256
I got locked in a cage

1079
01:12:07,256 --> 01:12:09,224
and had to beat up
 two guys to get here.

1080
01:12:13,862 --> 01:12:16,165
- Oh I wish I could see the
 expression on your face.

1081
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:19,435
- [Mom] I wish I could
 just see my face.

1082
01:12:22,938 --> 01:12:25,641
- Hey Dad, this just
 came by messenger.

1083
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:27,443
- The antidote.

1084
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:28,677
- [Mom] Oh thank God.

1085
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:32,915
- I can't wait to see you.

1086
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:34,717
How I have missed you.

1087
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:36,418
Okay honey.
 - I've missed me too.

1088
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:38,454
- Here we go.

1089
01:12:38,454 --> 01:12:40,356
Don't spill any.

1090
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:47,329
- [Mom] Did I get the right one?

1091
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:49,498
It tastes like water.

1092
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:54,136
- Nothing happened, I?

1093
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:56,572
- You mean it doesn't work.

1094
01:12:56,572 --> 01:12:58,407
(mom groans)

1095
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:00,242
- We're gonna figure
 out something son.

1096
01:13:00,242 --> 01:13:02,711
If I have to get the team
  at the lab to work on it,

1097
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,346
they're gonna work
 on it night and day

1098
01:13:04,346 --> 01:13:05,647
until we find an antidote.

1099
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:10,085
Sorry Laura, I'm so sorry.

1100
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:15,758
(mom moaning)

1101
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:19,194
(dog panting)

1102
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:22,998
- Hey Cosmo, what are you doing?

1103
01:13:24,266 --> 01:13:27,469
Sit, sit.

1104
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:32,474
Oh hey, I used to
 think you had it made.

1105
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:36,945
No mom to boss you around,
  no chores, no homework.

1106
01:13:38,947 --> 01:13:40,516
What am I gonna do Cosmo?

1107
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:44,787
Hey? C--

1108
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:48,423
Mom, Dad, come quick.

1109
01:13:48,423 --> 01:13:49,958
Cosmo, Cosmo I can see you.

1110
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,060
- [Mom] What is it?

1111
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:52,895
- Look.

1112
01:13:54,429 --> 01:13:56,865
- [Mom] She's visible.

1113
01:13:58,834 --> 01:14:01,370
- How did it happen,
what did you do to her?

1114
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:03,705
- Nothing, she was like
  this whenever she came in.

1115
01:14:03,705 --> 01:14:06,008
- [Mom] Karl, does this mean

1116
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:08,277
that the formula just wears off?

1117
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:11,213
- No I don't think so.

1118
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:13,215
It has to be a chemical reaction

1119
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:15,551
to something that
  she ate or drank.

1120
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:17,119
- Something in the house.

1121
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:18,020
- [Mom] Like what?

1122
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:19,922
- Let's look.

1123
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:22,391
- [Mom] Hurry Karl.

1124
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:31,700
- Let's just go
 through everything.

1125
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:34,036
- [Mom] What are we
 supposed to be looking for.

1126
01:14:35,571 --> 01:14:37,039
Nothing out of order here.

1127
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:44,346
There's nothing in here.

1128
01:14:47,249 --> 01:14:48,083
What?

1129
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:54,423
- Honey.

1130
01:14:54,423 --> 01:14:55,257
- [Mom] Yeah?

1131
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:58,193
- The dog food.

1132
01:14:58,193 --> 01:15:00,729
- [Mom] You want
 me to eat dog food.

1133
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:02,264
- Yes, yes, Cosmo did.

1134
01:15:02,264 --> 01:15:04,199
Maybe there's something in
  it, some chemical additive

1135
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:05,434
or preservative.

1136
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:07,336
You know, we won't
 know unless you try.

1137
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:09,838
(Mom sighing)

1138
01:15:11,573 --> 01:15:13,008
- [Mom] Blech!

1139
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:15,677
How can you eat this
 stuff Cosmo, ech.

1140
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:23,185
Well, is anything happening.

1141
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:26,321
- No, I guess it's
  not the dog food.

1142
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:27,155
Keep searching.

1143
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:29,358
- [Mom] Great.

1144
01:15:31,493 --> 01:15:33,729
(slurping)

1145
01:15:34,763 --> 01:15:35,964
Anything?

1146
01:15:35,964 --> 01:15:37,332
- Guess it's not the water.

1147
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:39,902
- [Mom] I'm not going to
drink out of the toilet.

1148
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:41,937
I don't care if it
 will make me visible.

1149
01:15:42,838 --> 01:15:44,072
- Course not.

1150
01:15:44,072 --> 01:15:46,241
- [Mom] And I'm not
 gonna bite fleas.

1151
01:15:47,342 --> 01:15:48,977
- Oh no, no, I wouldn't
have you do that.

1152
01:15:48,977 --> 01:15:50,679
But what else does Cosmo eat?

1153
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:52,381
- [Mom] Besides dog food.

1154
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,783
Table scraps when
  no-one's looking.

1155
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:58,053
- Table scraps!

1156
01:15:58,987 --> 01:16:00,455
I'll be right back.

1157
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:03,992
- [Mom] Wait, Karl,
 where are you going?

1158
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:06,728
- Dad what's the hurry?

1159
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:07,896
- I've got it.

1160
01:16:08,797 --> 01:16:10,265
- Oh yeah.

1161
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:13,268
- Now go get your mother,
 she's over by the refrigerator

1162
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:14,937
tell her to lay
  down by the sofa.

1163
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:24,947
You ate this, you
 drank this didn't you?

1164
01:16:29,017 --> 01:16:32,254
- [Mom] Josh, what is your
 father doing down in the lab?

1165
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:34,623
- Don't worry Mom,
  Dad's got an idea.

1166
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:35,924
- [Mom] I hope it's a good one.

1167
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,393
- Okay, I've found it.

1168
01:16:38,393 --> 01:16:41,063
It's a version of the
  formula that didn't work.

1169
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:42,798
My equation was off by 2%.

1170
01:16:42,798 --> 01:16:44,466
- [Mom] So?

1171
01:16:44,466 --> 01:16:47,869
- So, that 2% is the
 difference between the formula

1172
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:49,338
and the antidote.

1173
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:51,773
See, I put the beaker next
 to my dinner in the basement.

1174
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:53,709
When Cosmo tried to get
  the food, she knocked over

1175
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:57,312
the beaker, drank some of the
 liquid, now she's visible.

1176
01:16:57,312 --> 01:16:59,281
- Is there enough left for Mom?

1177
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:00,148
- Gosh I hope so.

1178
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:02,784
Well, let's go.

1179
01:17:04,653 --> 01:17:06,822
(gulping)

1180
01:17:09,524 --> 01:17:11,426
Okay, now we wait.

1181
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:15,263
- [Mom] I feel
  funny, all tingly.

1182
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:17,866
(dreamy music)

1183
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:32,914
- Gross.

1184
01:17:32,914 --> 01:17:34,916
- Look at that, amazing!

1185
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:56,972
- How do I look without makeup?

1186
01:17:58,140 --> 01:17:59,141
- Simply beautiful.

1187
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:02,611
- Mom, I can see you.

1188
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:05,847
Don't ever disappear again okay?

1189
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:07,082
- Okay.

1190
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:08,884
- (laughing) That
  goes for me too.

1191
01:18:10,052 --> 01:18:13,188
- Okay, but no more
 nutty experiments.

1192
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:16,825
- Oh, but I was working on this
experimental growth formula

1193
01:18:16,825 --> 01:18:18,060
that you can do on a baby chick,

1194
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,394
makes them grow to
 the size of a house.

1195
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:20,295
- Karl!

1196
01:18:21,696 --> 01:18:25,767
- I threw it out in the
 trash, don't worry about it.

1197
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:28,603
(strange barking)

1198
01:18:30,605 --> 01:18:31,773
- [All] Cosmo?

1199
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:36,178
(lively music)
