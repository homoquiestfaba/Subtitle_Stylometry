1
00:05:12,361 --> 00:05:14,046
<i>Yeah, no, I can't talk right now.</i>

2
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,781
No, I just walked into my office.

3
00:05:15,814 --> 00:05:17,750
I have a meeting. Yeah.

4
00:05:17,783 --> 00:05:20,419
All right. No.

5
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:23,022
<i>Yeah. No. Listen, no no no. It's not okay.</i>

6
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:24,924
Okay, I don't care if he's in court.

7
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:27,393
I'll call you back. Yeah, all right.

8
00:05:27,426 --> 00:05:29,729
Hey. Get over here.

9
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,240
It's good to see you on the outside.

10
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:37,436
Come on inside.

11
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:38,504
- Yeah.
- All right.

12
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:46,979
So, uh, can I get you anything?

13
00:05:47,012 --> 00:05:48,147
No, I'm good for now.

14
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,449
Um, should we take care of business?

15
00:05:50,482 --> 00:05:52,118
Let's see what you got.

16
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,787
Okay. Well, listen,
before we get into this,

17
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,122
I just want to tell you that, you know,

18
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,657
you've been away a long time and, uh...

19
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,793
<i>You know, quite a while.
Things have changed.</i>

20
00:06:00,826 --> 00:06:03,162
- So I heard.
- <i>They have.</i>

21
00:06:03,195 --> 00:06:06,165
Here's the status of your
three closest associates.

22
00:06:06,198 --> 00:06:08,534
As you know, Satto Campione

23
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:11,003
and Richard D'Amato testified against you

24
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:12,972
and many other people that you know.

25
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,907
<i>They both got five years each</i>

26
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,810
<i>for their service to the government.</i>

27
00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:19,645
And Dominic Salerno...

28
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:21,480
He died in prison of lung cancer.

29
00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:25,718
What a shame,
that prick bastard hump cocksucker.

30
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:27,486
I figured you'd say that.

31
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,455
Listen, I know he's not one
of your favorite people,

32
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:32,458
but, uh, Dominic, Jr... He's still around.

33
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:34,593
- Huh.
- <i>He tried to follow in your footsteps,</i>

34
00:06:34,626 --> 00:06:37,530
but he couldn't get the guys in
the neighborhood to support him.

35
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,098
You know, there's been some rumors

36
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:41,801
<i>that he's been cooperating
with the government,</i>

37
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,503
but I can't confirm that information.

38
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:46,772
Seems like he's got a, uh...

39
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:49,608
He's got some sort of a landscaping
business now, I believe.

40
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:51,510
Oh, good for him, little shit.

41
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:52,845
Yeah.

42
00:06:52,878 --> 00:06:54,747
You know, Ben, I can't believe all of this,

43
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,482
I'm telling you.

44
00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:00,753
Yeah. Listen, Joe,

45
00:07:00,786 --> 00:07:03,522
I spoke to the U.S. attorney's office,

46
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:06,826
and I have a paper here that
I gotta go over with you.

47
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,828
And you gotta sign it,

48
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:11,530
<i>and you gotta understand
everything I'm about to tell you.</i>

49
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:14,066
<i>Okay? Here is a list</i>

50
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:16,936
of every known member in organized crime,

51
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,637
according to the F.B.I.,

52
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,740
that you cannot talk to,
meet, associate with,

53
00:07:21,773 --> 00:07:25,110
<i>come in contact with in any shape,
way or form.</i>

54
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:27,263
<i>Do you understand what I'm
telling you here right now?</i>

55
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,648
I understand.

56
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:32,952
<i>Tell me this: What have I got left, Ben?</i>

57
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,821
Who am I gonna socialize with?

58
00:07:35,854 --> 00:07:37,490
I was a boss.

59
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:40,226
I ran neighborhoods.
I had men working for me.

60
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,127
<i>The feds got me by the balls now.</i>

61
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,729
I don't know if I'm gonna make it out here.

62
00:07:43,762 --> 00:07:45,130
I really don't. That's honest.

63
00:07:45,163 --> 00:07:47,633
Look, I wish I could make this transition

64
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,969
easier for you, but I can't.

65
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,538
<i>Maybe you should spend a little
more time with your daughter,</i>

66
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:55,808
<i>get reacquainted, take care of your health.</i>

67
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:58,744
It's not the same out there anymore, Joe.

68
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:00,579
It's just not.

69
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:02,815
The F.B.I. Is smarter, stronger and tougher

70
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:04,683
than it's ever been.

71
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:07,253
I mean, guys that want to be in
the life today are fucking nuts.

72
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:10,222
They get locked up and
arrested within three years.

73
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:13,292
10 guys get pinched,
nine guys want to cooperate.

74
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:17,196
<i>It's a fuckin'
race to the government's doorstep.</i>

75
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:20,099
And all due respect, Joe...

76
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,535
Please don't take this the wrong way...

77
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:25,538
But you're not the same man
you were 20 years ago.

78
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:29,542
<i>The life you knew and
loved is gone forever.</i>

79
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,611
I know you a long time
and I care about you.

80
00:08:32,644 --> 00:08:34,847
You're my friend.

81
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,651
But you gotta give it up. Its over, Joseph.

82
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,787
<i>You gotta listen to what I'm saying now.</i>

83
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,589
<i>It's done.</i>

84
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:06,145
Come on, sweetie.

85
00:09:08,313 --> 00:09:09,549
Come on.

86
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,563
I'm coming.

87
00:09:32,871 --> 00:09:34,607
Hey, guys! How are you?

88
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,075
- Hey, Bobby, how you doing?
- Good.

89
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,243
- Hey, Liv. What's up?
- Hi.

90
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:40,379
- Hi, Michelle.
- Hi.

91
00:09:40,412 --> 00:09:42,014
So how's it being back?

92
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:44,283
Oh, it's good, yeah. Well, we'll talk.

93
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:45,985
Come on in. Hey, dad,

94
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,921
Bobby's here from next
door with his family.

95
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:50,255
They've come to kill you

96
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:52,358
with cannolis. Oh my God.

97
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:53,993
Just what he needs, frigging cannolis.

98
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,161
Oh, my God! Bobby!

99
00:09:56,194 --> 00:09:57,730
<i>Hi.</i>

100
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,264
This is my wife Michelle.

101
00:09:59,297 --> 00:10:00,966
What a<i> Bella.</i>

102
00:10:02,109 --> 00:10:03,636
And this is Liv, my daughter.

103
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,005
- Hello, Liv.
- Hello.

104
00:10:07,623 --> 00:10:09,308
Look what they brought you, dad.

105
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:10,709
Just what you need, some cannolis.

106
00:10:10,742 --> 00:10:11,977
Put it on a plate and bring it out here.

107
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,345
Yeah, put it on a plate. Come with me.

108
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:15,014
We'll make some coffee.
We'll make some coffee.

109
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,815
- You didn't have to do that.
- Oh, it's my pleasure.

110
00:10:16,848 --> 00:10:18,150
It's good to see you, Mr. Joe.

111
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:19,184
Been a lot of years.

112
00:10:19,217 --> 00:10:20,352
Yeah.

113
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:21,387
Unbelievable.

114
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:22,388
It's good to see you.

115
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:23,389
- You, too.
- Yeah.

116
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:24,890
How's your family?
How's your mother and father?

117
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:26,191
They're good, they're great.

118
00:10:26,224 --> 00:10:27,426
They moved down to Florida.

119
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:28,694
- They retired.
- Where'd they go?

120
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:29,962
- Port St. Lucie.
- Wow.

121
00:10:29,995 --> 00:10:31,195
Got a little piece of property.

122
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:32,676
They built a house, so they're happy.

123
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:33,699
They told me to say hello.

124
00:10:33,732 --> 00:10:34,900
Send them my love, will you?

125
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:36,235
I will, I will.

126
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:37,436
- Jeez.
- Yeah.

127
00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:38,904
I can't believe you're...

128
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:40,139
I know, I know.

129
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,407
So what are you doing?

130
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,075
Ah, they left me the deli.

131
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:44,276
Keep it in the family.

132
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:45,978
Yeah, so I'm happy. It's fun.

133
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:48,047
There was two guys there.
They can't be there no more.

134
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,815
- Vinnie and Anthony.
- Oh, yeah, they're there.

135
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:51,750
Of course, they're a little older,
a little slower,

136
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:53,743
but they're there making sandwiches.
They're good.

137
00:10:53,752 --> 00:10:56,789
- What about carmine the bricklayer?
- He's still there.

138
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,290
With the chair like this? He's still there?

139
00:10:58,323 --> 00:10:59,458
Same thing.

140
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:00,891
We live in a time capsule over here.

141
00:11:00,892 --> 00:11:02,728
Yeah, you should come say hello to them.

142
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:04,129
- They'd love to see you.
- I will. There's no doubt.

143
00:11:04,162 --> 00:11:05,431
Yeah, everybody's happy you're back.

144
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,366
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

145
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,068
You know when I saw you last?

146
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:14,039
You were sitting like a king on his throne

147
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:15,841
in your '85 Camaro.

148
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:17,209
You wouldn't look left or right.

149
00:11:17,242 --> 00:11:18,711
You'd just look straight ahead.

150
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,112
"Look at me, everybody. Look at my car."

151
00:11:20,145 --> 00:11:23,148
Yeah, yeah, that's right, that's right.

152
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:25,384
I remember the last time I saw you, too.

153
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:28,020
Yeah. Yeah.

154
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:29,455
Yeah yeah.

155
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:32,491
- Come on, let's sit down and have some cannoli, huh?
- All right.

156
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:33,759
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

157
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:36,495
<i>I had way too much sugar.</i>

158
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:38,797
Sugar breaks down the immune system.

159
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,033
Sugar, yeah. That I need to know, right.

160
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:43,469
Listen, you people be careful going home.

161
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:44,870
<i>All right, we will.</i>

162
00:11:46,182 --> 00:11:48,340
Listen, like I said, if you need anything,

163
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:50,409
I'm either at the house or I'm at the deli,
all right?

164
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:52,042
Oh, yeah, he actually lives at the deli.

165
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:53,479
- Try him there first.
- Yeah, I'm easy to find there.

166
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,848
I will do that.
And it was very nice to see you.

167
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,449
- Yeah, see you later.
- All right, sweetie.

168
00:11:57,482 --> 00:11:59,051
- All right, Mr. Joe.
- I'll walk you out.

169
00:11:59,084 --> 00:12:00,919
The stoop's a little...
We need to fix that brick.

170
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:03,374
- Good night, good night.
- Thanks again, guys.

171
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:08,761
He looks old, right, sweetie?

172
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,530
Yeah. I feel bad for him.

173
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:12,998
I know.

174
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:15,167
But it's okay that I offered to, uh,

175
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,102
take him places and run errands for him

176
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:18,337
if I got the time, right?

177
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,872
Yeah, why? It's not like you're offering

178
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,840
to do anything illegal.

179
00:12:21,873 --> 00:12:22,607
Just be careful, though.

180
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,343
Remember what happened to my Uncle.

181
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,811
Your Uncle Iggy was a made guy

182
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:27,780
who ran errands for a boss.

183
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,114
I run a family deli.

184
00:12:29,147 --> 00:12:30,816
It's not... It's not as glamorous.

185
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:33,819
I know. I'm just saying.

186
00:12:33,852 --> 00:12:35,521
It's just nuts to see him like that.

187
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,189
I mean, that guy was the shit, right?

188
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:38,423
He was, wasn't he?

189
00:12:38,456 --> 00:12:39,858
Fuckin' Mr. Joe.

190
00:12:39,891 --> 00:12:41,193
He was so awesome.

191
00:12:41,226 --> 00:12:42,828
Yeah.

192
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:45,030
What does your dad think of him?

193
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:46,999
My dad? You know, they got along fine.

194
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,801
But my dad don't respect
that gangster shit.

195
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,302
No, he doesn't.

196
00:12:50,335 --> 00:12:52,337
That's 'cause he's an old-school,
hard-working guy.

197
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,939
Yeah, but, you know, they were fine.

198
00:12:53,972 --> 00:12:55,174
Yeah?

199
00:12:57,442 --> 00:12:59,011
Your daughter's sleeping.

200
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,479
- Is she?
- Yeah.

201
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:03,882
I'm a lucky guy.

202
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:05,151
Mmm.

203
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,603
Listen, I want you to have the best day.

204
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:26,405
- You take this.
- Is everything in here?

205
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:27,873
- Everything.
- The gabagoul and the provolone?

206
00:13:27,906 --> 00:13:29,608
- Everything, and the deposit.
- Okay.

207
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:32,611
I'll see you later. Angel, come with me.

208
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:34,112
Next week,
you're gonna stay home from school.

209
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:36,215
You'll be my assistant, I'll give you $5.

210
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,349
Okay.

211
00:13:37,382 --> 00:13:38,517
- Sweetheart.
- You ready?

212
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,985
Hey, high-five, no?

213
00:13:40,018 --> 00:13:41,320
- Hey. Hey.
- High-five.

214
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,522
Boom, boom, boom.

215
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:45,090
<i>Have the best day, all right, sweetheart?</i>

216
00:13:45,123 --> 00:13:46,859
How's the old man doing?

217
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:47,893
His heart... It's messed up.

218
00:13:47,926 --> 00:13:49,862
- No good, no good.
- No.

219
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,530
- Bad heart, you gotta...
- Bad shape.

220
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:53,532
- All that shit we eat.
- It is all the shit we eat.

221
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:55,567
It tastes good,
but it's so high in cholesterol and fat,

222
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,635
it's a wonder my heart hasn't exploded,

223
00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:59,004
working here,
eating it all the time, especially.

224
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:01,206
I got relatives who lived
to be almost 100 years old.

225
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:02,407
Great-aunts and whatnot.

226
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,575
I don't know how they do it, honestly.

227
00:14:03,608 --> 00:14:04,910
- You get lucky.
- Yeah.

228
00:14:04,943 --> 00:14:07,446
- That's it.
- It's very sad, very sad.

229
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:08,947
Powerful guy like that.

230
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,220
Powerful... Used to be powerful.

231
00:14:10,248 --> 00:14:11,617
Guy used to float when he walked.

232
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,318
You kidding me?

233
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:15,587
He was a piece of steel, this guy.

234
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,456
I feel bad. I feel bad.

235
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,391
What about a transplant?

236
00:14:19,424 --> 00:14:21,460
Heart transplant? He's got no insurance.

237
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:22,661
In his line of work?

238
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:24,129
Yeah.

239
00:14:24,162 --> 00:14:25,597
And how's he look? He looks old?

240
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,132
- He looks old.
- Not the same?

241
00:14:27,165 --> 00:14:29,601
That's what tripped me out. He looks old.

242
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:31,370
Know what I mean? He's, like, an old man.

243
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,438
He's, like, an older guy.

244
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,940
You gotta take care of that.

245
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:36,475
You gotta take care of yourself,

246
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,343
because it catches up to you.

247
00:14:38,376 --> 00:14:39,912
Let me tell you something.

248
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,246
That's why I'm here.

249
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,648
Every day, I walk from the house,

250
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:45,083
I'm here. Exercise. You're right.

251
00:14:45,116 --> 00:14:47,219
Carmine, you live two minutes away.

252
00:14:47,252 --> 00:14:49,288
There you go, breakin' balls again.

253
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:50,989
I'm saying, it's around the corner.

254
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:52,291
Hey, it's uphill, isn't it?

255
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,644
Oh, come on. You gotta do it more.

256
00:14:53,658 --> 00:14:56,028
Do it 30, 40 times, then talk to me.

257
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,130
You gotta, like, join a gym,
do something like that.

258
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:01,500
Gym. You know when I went
to the gym that time?

259
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:02,534
You got a membership, right?

260
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,270
I don't go anymore.
I fell on the treadmill there.

261
00:15:05,303 --> 00:15:07,139
<i>I end up on the floor.</i>

262
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:08,573
<i>They're all calling ambulances.</i>

263
00:15:08,606 --> 00:15:10,008
<i>I just fell.</i>

264
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,376
I made a misstep. I'm...

265
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:12,945
No, gym is out.

266
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,978
Plus, it stinks there. I can't take it.

267
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:20,152
You know they knocked down Shea, right?

268
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,653
<i>I heard about that.</i>

269
00:15:21,686 --> 00:15:23,326
<i>I didn't even know it when I was in jail.</i>

270
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:24,957
<i>I didn't even know it.</i>

271
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,058
- Isn't that terrible?
- <i>That's terrible.</i>

272
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,193
They knocked down fuckin' Shea stadium.

273
00:15:28,226 --> 00:15:29,728
- That's wrong.
- <i>Shea stadium!</i>

274
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:31,997
It's wrong. Man.

275
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,532
I won't go to the new place.
I haven't been there yet.

276
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,000
<i>I don't blame you.</i>

277
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:36,368
Shea stadium.

278
00:15:36,401 --> 00:15:38,704
Okay, nice, big breaths.

279
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,012
And give me one more.

280
00:15:50,682 --> 00:15:52,083
I want to explain everything to you

281
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,019
so we both know what to
expect from each other.

282
00:15:54,052 --> 00:15:57,055
That's good, doc.
Don't candy-coat nothin', all right?

283
00:15:57,088 --> 00:15:58,123
Okay, good.

284
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:01,693
Let's face it... The federal government

285
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:04,096
doesn't take the best care of its inmates,

286
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,364
so I came in late in the game.

287
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,165
Hmm. I understand, doc.

288
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:10,002
And because of that,
there's only so much I can do.

289
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:13,472
What you have now is
advanced cardiomyopathy,

290
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,407
or heart muscle disease.

291
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,175
It's a type of progressive heart disease

292
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,511
where the heart is abnormally enlarged,

293
00:16:19,544 --> 00:16:22,014
thickened or stiffened.

294
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,182
Your heart's ability
to pump blood is compromised,

295
00:16:24,215 --> 00:16:26,218
and eventually it can lead
to heart failure...

296
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,120
Back-up of blood into the lungs

297
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,222
or the rest of your body.

298
00:16:32,342 --> 00:16:33,658
So what you're telling me

299
00:16:33,691 --> 00:16:35,227
is eventually I'm gonna die.

300
00:16:36,594 --> 00:16:38,096
We all are.

301
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:40,098
That's very true, doc.

302
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:42,467
All we can do now is make
sure you stay on your meds,

303
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,302
do some light exercise,

304
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:47,105
try to go easy on foods that
are high in fats and starch.

305
00:16:47,138 --> 00:16:49,107
Doc, I've been away for 20 years.

306
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,660
I got a few years left.
I'm gonna enjoy them, if you don't mind.

307
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:54,279
Fair enough,
but at least try to get some exercise.

308
00:16:54,312 --> 00:16:56,648
I'm sure you have some catching up to do

309
00:16:56,681 --> 00:16:58,216
and, uh, some ladies to chase.

310
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:01,053
Well, I tell you something,

311
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,588
before we go into that subject,

312
00:17:03,621 --> 00:17:05,424
I gotta do like they do at N.A.S.A.

313
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,126
They find out if all
those systems are a-okay

314
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:09,795
before I open that silo,<i> capisce?</i>

315
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,630
Long time ago.

316
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,799
Gotcha. But you let me know.

317
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:16,301
I have some colleagues that can
help in that arena as well.

318
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:18,837
Oh!
You guys can do everything these days, huh?

319
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,139
Pretty much.

320
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,810
Mr. Scoleri, take care of yourself.

321
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,578
See you in about five or six weeks?

322
00:17:26,611 --> 00:17:28,080
Yes. Thanks, doc.

323
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,686
What the fuck?

324
00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:40,158
<i>Did they mention how long?</i>

325
00:17:40,191 --> 00:17:41,793
<i>No, the doctor can't tell for sure,</i>

326
00:17:41,826 --> 00:17:44,629
<i>but... he seems to be taking it well.</i>

327
00:17:44,662 --> 00:17:45,797
What can he do, right?

328
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,299
Nothing. Nothing.

329
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,467
What is this, sweetie?

330
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,502
Oh, Mrs. Panepinto dropped this off.

331
00:17:50,535 --> 00:17:52,137
- You want some?
- Yes, please.

332
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,505
- All right.
- A little bit.

333
00:17:53,538 --> 00:17:55,240
- Just a little bit.
- Just a little bit.

334
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:57,476
The doctor told him get some exercise,

335
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,444
rest when you can,
and he's got a bunch of pills

336
00:17:59,477 --> 00:18:01,113
he's gotta take every day.

337
00:18:02,511 --> 00:18:05,617
Unbelievable. You know,
I remember watching him and his crew

338
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,486
walk around on fresh pond road.

339
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,488
- He was like a God.
- I know, he was the man.

340
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:12,190
- Yeah.
- But not anymore.

341
00:18:12,223 --> 00:18:14,526
Now he's just regular Joe citizen.

342
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,329
Yeah. That's messed up.

343
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:20,299
- It's crazy, right?
- Yeah, it's amazing.

344
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,136
<i>That's decaf, dad.</i>

345
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:25,403
<i>You're not hitting the real stuff</i>

346
00:18:25,436 --> 00:18:26,872
<i>when I'm at work, right?</i>

347
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,540
Me? No, your honor.

348
00:18:28,573 --> 00:18:31,243
<i>What am I gonna do with you?</i>

349
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,812
<i>I was watching this show on the
cooking channel the other day.</i>

350
00:18:33,845 --> 00:18:35,581
They got a cooking channel?

351
00:18:36,814 --> 00:18:38,850
Yeah, dad, they got cooking channels.

352
00:18:38,883 --> 00:18:41,253
They got reality show channels,
fishing channels,

353
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,854
<i>they got channels, channels, channels.</i>

354
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:45,624
I heard that me and some of the guys

355
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:49,227
were actually on a documentary on T.V.
A couple of years ago.

356
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,362
<i>Where'd you hear that from?</i>

357
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,830
I heard it from one of the guys

358
00:18:51,863 --> 00:18:53,198
when I was in.

359
00:18:57,435 --> 00:18:59,938
Yeah, I heard about that, too.

360
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:03,275
Anyway, I was watching the cooking channel.

361
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,809
I love the cooking channel.

362
00:19:04,842 --> 00:19:06,444
And I noticed when this Italian chef

363
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:07,846
was talking about the food,

364
00:19:07,879 --> 00:19:10,315
he didn't drop his vowels the way we do.

365
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:12,184
What does that mean?

366
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,818
Well, he was saying "mozzarella,"

367
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:15,554
not "Moozzarell." You know.

368
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,422
Why do you think he was doing that?

369
00:19:17,455 --> 00:19:19,324
That's easy.
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

370
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:22,627
Dad, he's an Italian chef. He's from Italy.

371
00:19:24,356 --> 00:19:27,199
We're Italian.
Only that's the way we say it over here.

372
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,467
That's how they say it in queens.
That's right, yeah.

373
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,369
<i>Where do we live? We live in queens.</i>

374
00:19:31,402 --> 00:19:33,305
Yeah, we do. You're right, dad.

375
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,707
It's just that, you know, I've been...

376
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,310
Consciously working
on saying it the right way,

377
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:41,913
and it sounds a little uneducated.

378
00:19:41,946 --> 00:19:43,848
No, I don't mean it like that, dad.

379
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:45,650
I just mean that I've been working on,

380
00:19:45,683 --> 00:19:47,986
<i>you know, pronouncing things the right way.</i>

381
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:50,822
This way, when you go to the butcher
next time, he will understand you,

382
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:52,958
'cause he obviously doesn't
understand you now,

383
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,960
'cause you dropped your vowels.

384
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,428
Is that what you said you do?

385
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:59,231
No no, that's not what I'm saying.
That's not what I'm saying.

386
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:00,799
I don't know what to tell you.

387
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,301
Ahh.

388
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,270
It might be really nice

389
00:20:05,303 --> 00:20:06,988
if you tell me that you love me.

390
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:10,542
<i>You haven't told me you love me once</i>

391
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:12,577
<i>since you've been home.</i>

392
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,213
I'm just saying.

393
00:20:17,615 --> 00:20:20,319
That's what all this
talk about the food was?

394
00:20:21,352 --> 00:20:22,654
To come to this?

395
00:20:22,687 --> 00:20:24,789
No.

396
00:20:24,822 --> 00:20:26,524
It's just that, you know, you were away

397
00:20:26,557 --> 00:20:28,360
for a really long time,

398
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,495
<i>and we missed a lot of time.</i>

399
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:32,998
And it's just nice to hear sometimes,
that's all.

400
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,499
That's all.

401
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:38,670
Rita, I don't know. I'm not that guy.

402
00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:41,606
I'm not a sentimental kind of guy.
I don't...

403
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:44,309
<i>I would think you would
take that for granted.</i>

404
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,945
It's... I know you love me, dad.

405
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:48,613
It's just, you know,

406
00:20:48,646 --> 00:20:50,882
we missed a lot of time together.

407
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:52,884
You're home now.

408
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:54,620
You know, you're here now.

409
00:20:57,021 --> 00:20:59,024
<i>It's just nice to hear sometimes.</i>

410
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:00,825
<i>I don't even know why I brought it up.</i>

411
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:03,028
<i>Silly.</i>

412
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,034
All right, now, Livvy, honey,

413
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,702
I'm gonna show you something...

414
00:21:10,735 --> 00:21:13,438
How to really grow vegetables
that come beautiful.

415
00:21:13,471 --> 00:21:15,740
All right? Take the vegetable

416
00:21:15,773 --> 00:21:17,842
that you buy in the nursery.

417
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,345
Make a hole like this. That looks nice.

418
00:21:22,747 --> 00:21:24,449
Put this in here like this.

419
00:21:24,482 --> 00:21:26,017
Nice.

420
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,820
Then you scooch it around
over here like this.

421
00:21:28,853 --> 00:21:31,022
See? Now, the trick is,

422
00:21:31,055 --> 00:21:32,857
you gotta put manure.

423
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,427
- What's manure?
- Uh...

424
00:21:36,761 --> 00:21:38,029
This stuff here.

425
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:40,899
All right. Right over there.

426
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,435
The nice thing about this is,

427
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,570
when mommy goes to the
store to buy the organic...

428
00:21:45,603 --> 00:21:47,038
You know the organic?

429
00:21:47,071 --> 00:21:48,707
Well, that's what this does.
This is organic.

430
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,442
You don't need all that other stuff.

431
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,477
And that's the whole secret.

432
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,446
Okay? So remember...

433
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,680
Over here, put this here.

434
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:57,749
Put it in, and put on the manure.

435
00:21:57,782 --> 00:22:00,018
What's manure?

436
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,555
Uh...

437
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:05,090
Well, it's cow...

438
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:08,893
It's, uh...

439
00:22:08,926 --> 00:22:10,662
It's a cow, uh...

440
00:22:10,695 --> 00:22:12,464
Anyway, when you use it, see...

441
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,032
Here, here.

442
00:22:14,065 --> 00:22:15,867
You put some on. Come on.

443
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,602
Okay, nice.

444
00:22:17,635 --> 00:22:19,871
That's it, very good.

445
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,439
See?

446
00:22:21,472 --> 00:22:23,108
That's the whole story.

447
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,442
See?

448
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:27,679
You still haven't told me what manure is.

449
00:22:28,746 --> 00:22:30,448
Uh...

450
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:32,117
You know what? You know what?

451
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,819
- Bobby.
- What's up?

452
00:22:34,852 --> 00:22:36,421
You know what you do, sweetheart?

453
00:22:36,454 --> 00:22:37,922
You go ask daddy what it is.

454
00:22:37,955 --> 00:22:39,924
He'll tell you all about it, all right?

455
00:22:39,957 --> 00:22:41,926
Livvy's got a little question for you.

456
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:43,595
What's up, sweetheart?

457
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,699
- What is it, sweetie?
- Jeez.

458
00:22:47,732 --> 00:22:50,135
I forgot how tough it is
to be around little girls.

459
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:52,170
Like with Rita. Gotta be careful.

460
00:22:52,203 --> 00:22:54,172
It's not like a boy.

461
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:57,675
Or else they become a rough,
old, stupid old man like me.

462
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:59,778
All right. A little more cow shit.

463
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:00,846
Just a little bit.

464
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,083
There you go.

465
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:07,486
Nice and sweet.

466
00:23:13,691 --> 00:23:15,160
Hey, Tony, how you doing?

467
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,061
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, bobbo.

468
00:23:17,094 --> 00:23:18,196
- See that shot?
- Forget about it.

469
00:23:18,229 --> 00:23:20,198
It's crazy, right?

470
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:21,499
What's up, Vinnie? How you feeling?

471
00:23:21,532 --> 00:23:22,167
All right. How you doing?

472
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,502
- You good?
- Yeah.

473
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:26,504
What's going on?

474
00:23:26,537 --> 00:23:28,473
Can I talk to you in the back for a sec?

475
00:23:28,506 --> 00:23:30,175
- Yeah. What, are you all right?
- Yeah.

476
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,511
Yeah, why are you looking at me like that?

477
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:35,880
You're flipping faces at me.
What's the problem?

478
00:23:35,913 --> 00:23:37,449
Everything good at home?

479
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:38,850
- Yeah, everything's great.
- You sure?

480
00:23:38,883 --> 00:23:41,186
Yeah, why are you acting weird? What's up?

481
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:42,554
I think you're acting weird.

482
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,755
What's the deal, man? What's up?

483
00:23:43,788 --> 00:23:45,788
Some guys came looking for you earlier.

484
00:23:47,196 --> 00:23:48,460
- Hello?
- I see. F.B.I.?

485
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,061
Yeah. They're looking for you.

486
00:23:50,094 --> 00:23:52,130
- A big guy and another guy.
- Are you serious?

487
00:23:52,163 --> 00:23:54,065
Yeah, two guys...
a black guy and a white guy.

488
00:23:54,098 --> 00:23:56,468
What did you tell them?

489
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:57,836
I didn't say nothin',
'cause I don't know what to say,

490
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,504
'cause you're not telling me something,

491
00:23:59,537 --> 00:24:01,857
and maybe you need to tell me
something I don't know about.

492
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:04,209
- Nothing's going on. Nothing is going on.
- Maybe something's going on.

493
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:06,211
No, Vinnie, nothing's going on.

494
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:07,679
- Maybe something's going on.
- Just shut up. There's nothing going on.

495
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,647
- When did this happen?
- Today.

496
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,716
Maybe something's going on
you're not telling me about.

497
00:24:11,749 --> 00:24:13,952
You need to tell me,
so when these guys come looking for me,

498
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,220
- I'm not a jerk-off.
- Don't. Stop.

499
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:16,853
I'm sitting here with my dick in my hand.

500
00:24:16,854 --> 00:24:18,556
- They ask for my name?
- Yeah.

501
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:20,695
No, they asked for my name. They asked...

502
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,827
Hey, Anthony.

503
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,562
Hey, Dommo, how you doing?

504
00:24:24,595 --> 00:24:25,730
Good. How are you?

505
00:24:25,763 --> 00:24:27,098
All right. How's the family?

506
00:24:27,131 --> 00:24:28,933
Good. Everybody's the same.

507
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:31,269
- How's your kids?
- Everybody's good. Everybody's good.

508
00:24:31,302 --> 00:24:33,571
Good, good. So, uh...

509
00:24:33,604 --> 00:24:34,873
Bobby around?

510
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,508
Yeah, he's in the back.

511
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,009
Yeah? There he is.

512
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:39,244
Oh!

513
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:41,946
- Hey.
- Hey.

514
00:24:41,979 --> 00:24:43,581
- What's up, Dominic?
- How you doing, Bobby?

515
00:24:43,614 --> 00:24:46,284
- Good, how's it going?
- Good, good. You?

516
00:24:46,317 --> 00:24:47,585
You know, staying busy.

517
00:24:47,618 --> 00:24:49,120
Yeah, that's what I hear.

518
00:24:49,153 --> 00:24:51,155
What do you hear?

519
00:24:51,188 --> 00:24:52,790
What, are you getting defensive?

520
00:24:52,823 --> 00:24:54,225
No.

521
00:24:54,258 --> 00:24:56,961
I don't know.
You seem a little offended by me.

522
00:24:56,994 --> 00:24:58,596
No, not at all, Dominic.

523
00:24:58,629 --> 00:25:00,265
- You sure?
- Yes, what's going on?

524
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:03,268
Whew. That's good to knew.

525
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:05,637
So could you do me a favor, then?

526
00:25:07,104 --> 00:25:08,273
What is it?

527
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:09,607
Could you let your neighbor know

528
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,809
that I send him my absolute best?

529
00:25:11,842 --> 00:25:13,645
Yeah. Sure.

530
00:25:18,616 --> 00:25:19,885
Is that all?

531
00:25:21,118 --> 00:25:22,620
Could you also let him know

532
00:25:22,653 --> 00:25:23,721
that I'd like to have
a cup of coffee with him?

533
00:25:23,754 --> 00:25:25,223
No, that's not gonna happen.

534
00:25:25,256 --> 00:25:27,625
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

535
00:25:27,658 --> 00:25:30,028
There's no underlying point to
my response to you, Dominic,

536
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:31,763
except for I'm not gonna
tell him anything more

537
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:34,098
than "hi, how are you?
I hope you're well." That's it.

538
00:25:34,131 --> 00:25:36,067
Who died and left you a pair of balls, huh?

539
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,835
Dominic, cut the bullshit.

540
00:25:37,868 --> 00:25:40,271
He's an old man, he just came back.

541
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:41,271
He's not feeling good.

542
00:25:41,272 --> 00:25:43,274
He's not supposed to talk to or associate

543
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:44,809
with anybody who could
get him into trouble.

544
00:25:44,842 --> 00:25:47,211
You know the fuckin' drill, right?

545
00:25:47,244 --> 00:25:49,247
You know what I like about you, Bobby?

546
00:25:51,315 --> 00:25:52,717
Go ahead.

547
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,653
You're still one of the good kids.

548
00:25:55,853 --> 00:25:57,355
You never got in trouble,

549
00:25:57,388 --> 00:26:00,592
you kept your nose clean,
never got caught up with us.

550
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:03,227
But... just watch your fuckin' mouth

551
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,597
and don't forget who you're fuckin'
talking to.

552
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,631
<i>Capisce?</i>

553
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:11,736
You done?

554
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,641
Yeah, I'm done.

555
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,411
All right.

556
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:20,878
Have a good day, all right?

557
00:26:20,911 --> 00:26:23,715
You, too. Take care.

558
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,151
Gents. Keep her clean.

559
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:33,758
Fucking guy.

560
00:26:35,651 --> 00:26:37,862
<i>Should've smacked him in the fuckin' teeth.</i>

561
00:26:37,895 --> 00:26:39,130
<i>Prick.</i>

562
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:47,872
Thank you.

563
00:26:47,905 --> 00:26:49,007
Yeah.

564
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,675
- Hey.
- <i>Hey, Bobby.</i>

565
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,243
- How are you?
- <i>Good.</i>

566
00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:54,746
I want you to meet my parole guy,
officer Ramirez.

567
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,314
This is Bobby, my next-door neighbor.

568
00:26:56,347 --> 00:26:57,715
Nice to meet you.

569
00:26:57,748 --> 00:26:59,050
Federal probation, not parole.

570
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:00,718
You keeping this guy out of trouble?

571
00:27:00,751 --> 00:27:02,420
I'm trying, I'm trying.
It gets hard, but he's good.

572
00:27:02,453 --> 00:27:04,956
What trying? My days are numbered, pal.

573
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:06,691
Yeah, well, I got a feeling

574
00:27:06,724 --> 00:27:09,360
that you'd give me a run
for my money if you could.

575
00:27:09,393 --> 00:27:11,195
Back in the day.

576
00:27:11,228 --> 00:27:13,731
Not no more now. I got a bum ticker.

577
00:27:13,764 --> 00:27:15,900
Every day I get up, that's a blessing.

578
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,038
Well, I'll see you next week, Mr. Scoleri.

579
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,305
- I'll be waiting.
- Nice meeting you, Bobby.

580
00:27:21,338 --> 00:27:22,774
Nice to meet you, too.

581
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,043
Oh, just as a formality,
I just need your last name.

582
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:27,378
Dibianco.

583
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:29,213
You don't look like a dibianco.

584
00:27:29,246 --> 00:27:30,748
I know, I get that all the time.

585
00:27:30,781 --> 00:27:32,016
Why do you ask?

586
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:34,018
We just like to know who
he's associating with.

587
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:35,787
He's... he's good. He's good.

588
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,789
<i>I know him before he was born.</i>

589
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:38,956
I know his father. It's a good family.

590
00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:40,469
Stand-up guy, his father. Hard worker.

591
00:27:40,491 --> 00:27:42,260
- No need to explain.
- Been here my whole life.

592
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:44,395
- I understand. See you guys.
- No problem.

593
00:27:44,428 --> 00:27:45,763
- Take care.
- Have a good day.

594
00:27:45,796 --> 00:27:47,799
Thank you. What's up, Bobby?

595
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,767
How you feeling? You good?

596
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,035
Eh.

597
00:27:51,068 --> 00:27:52,828
Listen, I'm gonna go for
a walk in the park.

598
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,238
You want to come get some exercise?

599
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:56,040
It's too cold. I'm not in the mood.

600
00:27:56,073 --> 00:27:57,108
All right.

601
00:27:57,141 --> 00:27:58,976
Listen, I, uh...

602
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:00,445
I don't know if I'm
supposed to mention this,

603
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,280
or even if you care, but Dom Salerno, Jr...

604
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:04,015
<i>He came into the deli.</i>

605
00:28:04,048 --> 00:28:05,983
He sends his regards and says hello.

606
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,885
Do me a favor.

607
00:28:07,918 --> 00:28:11,255
Don't ever mention that
motherfucker's name again.

608
00:28:11,288 --> 00:28:13,191
Not ever. Not to me, not ever.

609
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,427
I... I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to offend you.

610
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,229
Bobby, do me a favor. Leave me be today.

611
00:28:18,262 --> 00:28:19,831
It's all right. All right?

612
00:28:21,832 --> 00:28:25,203
All right, I'll... I'll see you later.

613
00:28:28,439 --> 00:28:30,508
<i>Hmm. This health insurance company</i>

614
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:32,043
is just so screwed up.

615
00:28:32,076 --> 00:28:33,878
People are getting denied coverage

616
00:28:33,911 --> 00:28:35,111
that used to be entitled to it.

617
00:28:35,112 --> 00:28:36,347
How anything gets done,

618
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,849
I have no idea, dad.

619
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,851
I heard that if we lived in Europe,

620
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,352
I could get a new heart, no problem,

621
00:28:41,385 --> 00:28:42,954
no cost, no nothin'.

622
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:44,522
Not here, dad.

623
00:28:44,555 --> 00:28:46,357
Not in the richest country in the world.

624
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,227
Yeah, well... maybe this president of ours

625
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,229
could throw a couple of ideas our way.

626
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:53,798
I'm not gonna hold my breath.

627
00:28:53,831 --> 00:28:55,867
Let me ask you something.

628
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,900
Hmm?

629
00:28:57,958 --> 00:28:59,537
How's the boyfriend situation?

630
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,405
Am I gonna see some grandkids,

631
00:29:01,438 --> 00:29:03,341
or am I gonna go to my
death without hearing,

632
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,443
"grandpa! Hi, grandpa!"

633
00:29:05,476 --> 00:29:08,479
Dad, come on, stop.

634
00:29:08,512 --> 00:29:10,081
Sometimes I think I'm paying a debt

635
00:29:10,114 --> 00:29:12,317
from something I did in some other life.

636
00:29:14,351 --> 00:29:16,320
You're getting all spiritual now.

637
00:29:16,353 --> 00:29:18,356
No, I'm just saying it ain't easy.

638
00:29:20,257 --> 00:29:23,027
I know it's not, dad. But you know what?

639
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,530
You lived life to the fullest,
and you know you did.

640
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:28,065
And in another time,
you wouldn't have gone away.

641
00:29:28,098 --> 00:29:30,268
But it's different nowadays.

642
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:31,969
That's what I heard.

643
00:29:32,002 --> 00:29:33,471
Where's the fuckin' loyalty?

644
00:29:33,504 --> 00:29:35,106
I'm sorry. Pardon my French.

645
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:39,410
Yeah, nobody came around
when you were gone,

646
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:40,845
not that I needed anything.

647
00:29:40,878 --> 00:29:42,814
The important thing is I'm back here.

648
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:44,348
Give credit to the feds.

649
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:47,952
They made me go home and die in my own bed.

650
00:29:47,985 --> 00:29:49,587
Credit to them, the mutts.

651
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,056
Dad, don't say that, okay?

652
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:53,925
I'm sorry.

653
00:29:57,628 --> 00:29:59,530
I want to ask you a question, dad,

654
00:29:59,563 --> 00:30:01,899
and it's hypothetical,
so I don't want you to panic.

655
00:30:01,932 --> 00:30:03,868
Go ahead.

656
00:30:03,901 --> 00:30:06,037
What would you do if you had a son...

657
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,572
I don't have a son.

658
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:08,873
Let me finish.

659
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,410
What would you do if you had a son

660
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:13,978
and he was gay?

661
00:30:18,282 --> 00:30:19,851
What, a fag?<i> Madon.</i>

662
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:21,586
I'd kill the little bastard.

663
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:23,921
Why, dad?
He's a human being like everybody else.

664
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:26,591
No, that's not a human
being like everybody else.

665
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,526
They take it you-know-where.

666
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,995
No, that's not natural. That's a homo.

667
00:30:31,028 --> 00:30:34,232
So being gay means you automatically
take it in the you-know-where?

668
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:35,933
Yeah. Listen to me, honey, okay?

669
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:37,568
It's not natural.

670
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:39,370
I don't have a son, but if I did,

671
00:30:39,403 --> 00:30:41,038
I would raise him to be a man.

672
00:30:41,071 --> 00:30:42,440
It's when you mollycoddle them,

673
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:44,075
that's when they come out that way.

674
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:45,977
Dad, it's got nothing to do

675
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,012
with whether you raise
him like a man or not.

676
00:30:48,045 --> 00:30:49,647
Could we talk about something else?

677
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,616
I don't have a son.
This doesn't pertain to me

678
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:54,185
'cause I don't have a son.

679
00:30:54,218 --> 00:30:57,021
And I'm getting agita from this, all right?

680
00:30:57,054 --> 00:30:58,356
Well, you have a daughter.

681
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:59,524
Yeah? And?

682
00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:02,994
What if I told you I was gay?

683
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,463
What?! Get out!

684
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:06,664
What are you giving me this crap for?

685
00:31:06,697 --> 00:31:08,366
What the hell are you talking about?

686
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,167
- Ridiculous.
- I'm just saying, what if?

687
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,937
What if what?
What, are you telling me you're a dyke?

688
00:31:15,973 --> 00:31:17,541
No, dad. I'm...

689
00:31:17,574 --> 00:31:19,110
I'm saying...

690
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:21,045
I'm saying that I'm gay.

691
00:31:29,653 --> 00:31:30,955
You're not.

692
00:31:32,723 --> 00:31:35,026
Yeah, dad. I am.

693
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,995
Seriously. I'm gay.

694
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:43,701
What did I do? I know I've done
a lot of bad things in my life,

695
00:31:43,734 --> 00:31:46,237
but I paid for that.
But what did I do to you?

696
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,239
No no no, dad. Listen to me.

697
00:31:48,272 --> 00:31:49,407
Listen to me, please.

698
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,008
You didn't do anything okay?

699
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:53,010
It's just the way I am. It's...

700
00:31:53,043 --> 00:31:55,046
It's... the way I came out.

701
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,048
I've always been attracted to women.

702
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,016
Come on, dad. I'm 43 years old,

703
00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:01,523
and I've never been married.
What did you think?

704
00:32:02,686 --> 00:32:05,356
What about Artie from St. Mary's?

705
00:32:05,389 --> 00:32:08,359
- Who? From where?
- Artie. St. Mary's.

706
00:32:08,392 --> 00:32:11,395
Oh my God. Artie?

707
00:32:11,428 --> 00:32:14,232
Dad, Artie... he's a
hairdresser in the city.

708
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,269
What did...

709
00:32:18,302 --> 00:32:21,005
I mean, this... I'm speechless.

710
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,577
I... we're gonna get through
this together, okay?

711
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,312
We're gonna get through this, all right?

712
00:32:28,345 --> 00:32:29,747
Just don't you worry about it.

713
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,082
What are we gonna get through, dad?

714
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,984
They got pills for this.

715
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:34,337
They got... They must have pills.

716
00:32:34,351 --> 00:32:35,753
They got pills to make your hair grow.

717
00:32:35,786 --> 00:32:37,321
They got pills to make your eyelashes grow.

718
00:32:37,354 --> 00:32:39,090
I saw it.

719
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,959
I don't want any pills, dad.

720
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:44,161
Well, maybe you could get some therapy,

721
00:32:44,194 --> 00:32:46,030
go to a psych guy, you know?

722
00:32:46,063 --> 00:32:47,565
I don't want any therapy, dad.

723
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:48,599
I don't want a psych guy.

724
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:52,036
I'm really happy with who
I am and who I'm with.

725
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,674
Who are you... who?

726
00:32:57,745 --> 00:32:59,377
I was living with my girlfriend

727
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,512
for a while, dad, before you came home.

728
00:33:02,646 --> 00:33:04,248
Where?

729
00:33:04,281 --> 00:33:05,683
What's the difference?

730
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:08,619
Living in my house with a dyke?

731
00:33:08,652 --> 00:33:10,488
Dad, nobody cares.

732
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,123
Yeah, they care.

733
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,026
What the hell are you talking about?

734
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,728
Ohh, wow.

735
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:20,297
Jeez!

736
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,434
Maybe I should just drop fuckin'
dead right now.

737
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:26,670
You know what, dad? Stop, all right?
Please.

738
00:33:26,703 --> 00:33:28,006
Please stop.

739
00:33:30,407 --> 00:33:32,076
I am speechless.

740
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,482
So will you meet her for dinner?

741
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:42,053
What are you talking about?

742
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:43,454
How can you say things like...

743
00:33:43,487 --> 00:33:45,223
How can you say that to me?

744
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:50,094
Meet her for dinner? With you and a dyke?

745
00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:51,262
God.

746
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:52,663
Nice.

747
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:57,068
You know what, dad?

748
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:58,736
You don't know anything about her.

749
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:02,506
You don't even... you
know nothing about me.

750
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:06,577
You left me 20 years ago

751
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:09,513
because of the choices
you made in your life.

752
00:34:09,546 --> 00:34:11,182
Wait a minute. That's out of line.

753
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,383
- Oh, I'm out of line?
- Yeah.

754
00:34:12,416 --> 00:34:15,416
You just called my girlfriend a dyke,
and I'm out of line?

755
00:34:16,653 --> 00:34:18,189
I have news for you, dad.

756
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,357
I haven't lived in your house

757
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,693
for almost 15 years.

758
00:34:22,726 --> 00:34:24,128
I've been living in the city

759
00:34:24,161 --> 00:34:26,664
in my apartment with my girlfriend.

760
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,399
<i>I only came back to queens</i>

761
00:34:28,432 --> 00:34:30,501
<i>so that you would feel like
you hadn't missed anything,</i>

762
00:34:30,534 --> 00:34:32,169
<i>and because I love you so much.</i>

763
00:34:32,202 --> 00:34:33,871
And right now I am regretting

764
00:34:33,904 --> 00:34:36,374
every second of that decision.

765
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,178
Sweetheart, I...

766
00:34:44,181 --> 00:34:45,549
Don't.

767
00:34:45,582 --> 00:34:48,219
Don't, dad, please. Don't "sweetheart" me.

768
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,590
You know what? I know that I'm not the son

769
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:54,125
<i>that you always wanted,</i>

770
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:56,561
<i>and I'm really okay with that, dad.</i>

771
00:34:57,594 --> 00:34:59,163
And there's one more thing.

772
00:34:59,196 --> 00:35:00,198
My mother...

773
00:35:01,665 --> 00:35:04,602
I found her. Do you remember her?

774
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:08,239
<i>Thanks for lying to me
about her being dead.</i>

775
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,341
Jesus, dad, didn't you
think that I would...

776
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:11,775
That I would ever be curious

777
00:35:11,808 --> 00:35:13,344
as to why I never knew my mother

778
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,146
or I didn't know anything about her?

779
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:17,581
I mean, why? Why would you do that to me?

780
00:35:17,614 --> 00:35:21,352
<i>She's a beautiful woman,
with her issues and all.</i>

781
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:24,855
<i>So what is it, dad?</i>

782
00:35:24,888 --> 00:35:27,358
What, are you embarrassed?

783
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,226
Are you embarrassed that your daughter

784
00:35:29,259 --> 00:35:30,828
is not all Italian?

785
00:35:40,871 --> 00:35:44,475
I'm sorry, dad. I'm really sorry.

786
00:35:44,508 --> 00:35:46,243
But the way you feel right now

787
00:35:46,276 --> 00:35:47,712
<i>is how you made me feel.</i>

788
00:35:49,346 --> 00:35:51,482
You see if they got a pill for that.

789
00:35:51,515 --> 00:35:53,918
Oh, come on, Rita.

790
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:01,726
Jesus Christ.

791
00:36:25,382 --> 00:36:26,617
Can I help you?

792
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,319
- You Bobby dibianco?
- Yeah.

793
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,620
I'm special agent O'Bannon.

794
00:36:29,653 --> 00:36:31,422
This is special agent Butler, F.B.I.

795
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,291
Mind if we ask you a few questions?

796
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:37,228
Sure.

797
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:38,495
Can... can we do it outside?

798
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,797
My family's in here.

799
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:40,998
- Absolutely.
- No problem.

800
00:36:41,031 --> 00:36:42,500
After you.

801
00:36:55,412 --> 00:36:57,982
You know, you look more like
a Connor that a dibianco.

802
00:36:58,015 --> 00:36:59,516
Yeah, I get that all the time.

803
00:36:59,549 --> 00:37:01,619
Uh, it's my mother's maiden name.

804
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,654
Yeah, we know. We did our homework.

805
00:37:04,588 --> 00:37:06,323
We're with the organized crime task force

806
00:37:06,356 --> 00:37:07,457
out of the B.Q. Office.

807
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,760
Right, I got the card
from my employee the other day.

808
00:37:09,793 --> 00:37:11,393
- That was you guys, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

809
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,997
How well do you know Joseph Scoleri?

810
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:16,033
God, he's been my neighbor
since before I was born.

811
00:37:16,066 --> 00:37:17,735
And, you know, he just came back,

812
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:19,403
as I'm sure you guys know.

813
00:37:19,436 --> 00:37:21,372
And, uh, I'm just trying to do

814
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,640
what a lot of us do in this area,

815
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:25,042
which is help out, you know? Neighborly.

816
00:37:25,075 --> 00:37:26,977
Well, we just noticed

817
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,779
that you've been spending a
lot of time with him lately,

818
00:37:28,812 --> 00:37:30,047
and we wanted to make
sure that you understand

819
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,716
who you're dealing with.

820
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:36,020
No, I know all about Mr. Scoleri,

821
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:37,855
and I know about everything that went down,

822
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:40,024
so I understand, you know.

823
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:41,759
But the reality is...

824
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,027
He's just an old man with nobody around

825
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,030
except for his daughter, who's working
all the time just to keep the lights on.

826
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:49,433
So I'm just trying to...
Help out. That's all.

827
00:37:49,466 --> 00:37:51,402
Yeah, you're quite the neighbor.
Just make sure

828
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,278
<i>it doesn't go any further than that.</i>

829
00:37:59,409 --> 00:38:00,811
Is that it?

830
00:38:00,844 --> 00:38:02,880
Thank you very much for your time.

831
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:04,548
<i>Hey, Mr. dibianco?</i>

832
00:38:04,581 --> 00:38:07,084
- Bobby.
- Bobby, right, right.

833
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:09,386
He's a dying breed, you know?

834
00:38:09,419 --> 00:38:11,455
Not really worth getting in trouble for.

835
00:38:11,488 --> 00:38:13,557
You have a lot to lose. If I were you,

836
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,459
<i>I'd keep my distance.</i>

837
00:38:15,492 --> 00:38:17,361
Besides, you know they only sent him home

838
00:38:17,394 --> 00:38:19,063
because he's dying soon, right?

839
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,065
That's really nice of the
federal penitentiary system.

840
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:23,934
I'll make sure to tell Mr. Joe and
his daughter you guys said that.

841
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:25,636
Mr. Joe. Right, right.

842
00:38:25,669 --> 00:38:27,404
That's important around here.

843
00:38:27,437 --> 00:38:29,473
You take care of yourself.

844
00:38:44,654 --> 00:38:46,324
What are you doing?

845
00:38:48,992 --> 00:38:50,594
Everything's all right.

846
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,542
Hello?

847
00:39:05,575 --> 00:39:07,544
Happy Birthday!

848
00:39:07,577 --> 00:39:09,513
- Happy Birthday, baby.
- Thank you.

849
00:39:09,546 --> 00:39:11,615
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

850
00:39:11,648 --> 00:39:12,916
Happy Birthday, Bobby.

851
00:39:12,949 --> 00:39:14,451
Thank you, thank you.

852
00:39:14,484 --> 00:39:15,485
Surprised to see you here.

853
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,941
Hey,
two beautiful girls asked me to come over.

854
00:39:19,823 --> 00:39:21,658
As my mother would say.

855
00:39:21,691 --> 00:39:23,460
All right, you guys want to have some cake?

856
00:39:23,493 --> 00:39:25,162
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's good to see you.

857
00:39:25,195 --> 00:39:26,597
Thank you, little girl.

858
00:39:28,665 --> 00:39:30,701
So you're not actually from queens?

859
00:39:30,734 --> 00:39:33,570
No no. Bronx-bred.
No no. It was lighter then,

860
00:39:33,603 --> 00:39:35,406
- if you know what I'm talking about.
- Right, right.

861
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,974
Okay, now I want to play 50 questions.

862
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:38,909
- Please.
- Okay.

863
00:39:38,942 --> 00:39:40,878
<i>So what was your first job?</i>

864
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:43,680
Ohh. Cleaning up the fish guts

865
00:39:43,713 --> 00:39:45,449
at the Fulton fish market.

866
00:39:45,482 --> 00:39:46,850
- Wow.
- Worst job in the world.

867
00:39:46,883 --> 00:39:50,187
I mean, the smell... I
can still remember it.

868
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,823
I remember that it gave me the feeling

869
00:39:52,856 --> 00:39:54,625
I gotta do something else.

870
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,493
And that led me down the wrong path,

871
00:39:56,526 --> 00:39:58,028
but it led me on a different path.

872
00:39:58,061 --> 00:39:59,763
- Sure.
- I wanted to get out of there

873
00:39:59,796 --> 00:40:01,098
the first five minutes I was there,

874
00:40:01,131 --> 00:40:03,667
but I couldn't quit.
My father was a hard-ass.

875
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,470
- I'm sorry. Uh...
- It's okay.

876
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:07,671
<i>It ain't the first time she's heard it.</i>

877
00:40:07,704 --> 00:40:08,939
She heard it before. Don't worry about it.

878
00:40:08,972 --> 00:40:11,041
The fact of the matter,

879
00:40:11,074 --> 00:40:13,210
he was a very hard-working man,

880
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:14,778
like your father. Same thing.

881
00:40:14,811 --> 00:40:16,513
I appreciate that, thank you.

882
00:40:16,546 --> 00:40:17,881
<i>No, it's the truth.</i>

883
00:40:17,914 --> 00:40:20,083
- Yeah, just like him.
- Yeah.

884
00:40:20,116 --> 00:40:21,952
- I have a question.
- Yes, honey.

885
00:40:21,985 --> 00:40:26,190
My friend at school told me
that you used to be a gangster.

886
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:27,958
Oh, that's not appropriate...

887
00:40:27,991 --> 00:40:30,694
Whoa, who... Who said that? Huh?

888
00:40:30,727 --> 00:40:33,197
But you want to know something?

889
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,631
That is not a question.

890
00:40:40,003 --> 00:40:41,238
Thank you, Bobby.

891
00:40:41,271 --> 00:40:42,739
All right, Mr. Joe.

892
00:40:42,772 --> 00:40:44,908
Thanks for coming, all right?

893
00:40:44,941 --> 00:40:47,478
Listen, Bobby, the other day,
when you asked me...

894
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:48,879
- Don't worry about it.
- Yeah?

895
00:40:48,912 --> 00:40:50,714
- Don't worry about it.
- All right.

896
00:40:50,747 --> 00:40:52,249
You got a beautiful family.

897
00:40:52,282 --> 00:40:53,684
<i>Thank you. I know, I'm lucky.</i>

898
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:55,085
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

899
00:40:55,118 --> 00:40:56,587
If you need anything, let me know, okay?

900
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,255
- I will do that.
- All right.

901
00:40:58,288 --> 00:40:59,289
Get home safe.

902
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:01,992
- Thanks, Bo...
- Oh, I'm kidding.

903
00:41:02,025 --> 00:41:03,961
Yeah. It's worth repeating.

904
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:05,562
Okay.

905
00:41:05,595 --> 00:41:07,531
Gee, where do I live?

906
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,068
Have a good night, all right, Mr. Joe?

907
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:12,570
Yeah, thanks.

I'm afraid that's all there is today.

916
00:42:12,862 --> 00:42:14,598
That will do.

917
00:42:14,631 --> 00:42:15,999
Thank you.

I hope all the crack I've been smoking

00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:32,082
- don't show up.
- Funny.

921
00:42:39,389 --> 00:42:43,060
- You're good.
- Hey, would you mind taking that with you?

922
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:44,995
This?

923
00:42:45,028 --> 00:42:46,564
Come on, let's go.

924
00:42:48,331 --> 00:42:51,068
You're comfortable.
You look very comfortable.

925
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:53,070
You're well-adjusted.

926
00:42:54,237 --> 00:42:55,973
How's it going?

927
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:57,174
Not bad.

928
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:01,078
You're still seeing Dr. Shapiro regularly?

929
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:02,212
I am.

930
00:43:04,681 --> 00:43:07,784
I got a call from an F.B.I.
Agent... O'Bannon...

931
00:43:07,817 --> 00:43:09,620
From the New York office.

932
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:11,338
That's nice. Give him my regards.

933
00:43:14,623 --> 00:43:16,360
You're really clear on who you can

934
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:19,262
and can't associate with, right?

935
00:43:19,295 --> 00:43:20,631
Crystal clear.

936
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:23,801
How's your neighbor?

937
00:43:24,901 --> 00:43:27,104
Bobby dibianco?

938
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:30,007
Very nice person. Very nice family.

939
00:43:31,988 --> 00:43:33,410
I hear he takes great pride

940
00:43:33,443 --> 00:43:35,178
in looking after you.

941
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:36,614
Yes, he does.

942
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:39,716
That's what we do. It's a Sicilian thing.

943
00:43:39,749 --> 00:43:41,385
Your people do that?

944
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:42,419
- My people?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

945
00:43:42,452 --> 00:43:43,820
Do what?

946
00:43:43,853 --> 00:43:46,156
Take care of each other.

947
00:43:46,189 --> 00:43:47,924
Who are you referring to?

948
00:43:47,957 --> 00:43:49,826
People taking care of people.

949
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:51,128
Neighbors.

950
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:53,263
Like a community.

951
00:43:53,296 --> 00:43:54,798
<i>A village.</i>

952
00:43:59,235 --> 00:44:00,838
I'll see you next week.

953
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,374
Wait a minute. I thought
we were on monthly.

954
00:44:04,407 --> 00:44:06,410
No. That's my call.

955
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:08,112
We're on weekly.

956
00:44:13,316 --> 00:44:15,085
Fuckin' mutt.

957
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,436
Hold on, I'm coming.

958
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,474
- Hi. Mr. Scoleri?
- Yeah.

959
00:44:37,507 --> 00:44:40,177
Uh, I'm Anna, one of Rita's friends.

960
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,446
- Hi, Anna.
- It's so nice to meet you.

961
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:44,381
- You, too.
- Rita's caught up at work,

962
00:44:44,414 --> 00:44:45,849
so she asked me to come pick you up

963
00:44:45,882 --> 00:44:47,150
and take you to your doctor's appointment.

964
00:44:47,183 --> 00:44:49,886
Oh. What a pleasant surprise.

965
00:44:49,919 --> 00:44:51,822
I never expected such a beautiful girl

966
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:52,956
to come and take me anywhere today.

967
00:44:52,989 --> 00:44:54,124
Why, thank you.

968
00:44:54,157 --> 00:44:55,325
I'll go wherever you tell me.

969
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:57,828
- Ha! You're a flirt, aren't you?
- A little bit.

970
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,062
I'll be right back.

971
00:44:59,095 --> 00:45:00,430
- Gotta get my coat.
- Okay.

972
00:45:00,463 --> 00:45:01,798
I've got an umbrella.

973
00:45:01,831 --> 00:45:04,067
- You're not going anywhere.
- No.

974
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,769
Waiting right here for you.

975
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:34,798
Mr. Joe?

976
00:45:34,831 --> 00:45:36,366
<i>Come on in, it's open.</i>

977
00:45:39,525 --> 00:45:41,104
How you feeling? You all right?

978
00:45:41,137 --> 00:45:42,405
<i>Yeah.</i>

979
00:45:42,438 --> 00:45:44,174
I got some vegetables.

980
00:45:44,207 --> 00:45:47,310
- Thanks.
- And fruit and, uh...

981
00:45:47,343 --> 00:45:48,478
<i>Some milk.</i>

982
00:45:48,511 --> 00:45:50,514
Thanks, Bobby.

983
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:52,783
Hey, Bobby,
you understand this thing over here?

984
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:54,117
<i>What's that?</i>

985
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:55,519
I can't get this thing to work.

986
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:57,287
<i>What's that? A C.D.?</i>

987
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,791
- Yeah, that's a C.D.
- Yeah, I got it.

988
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:02,359
We had cassettes in my time.

989
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:03,552
We didn't have this over here.

990
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,895
You just put it in and press the button.

991
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,008
This, I don't understand it.

992
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:07,430
Yeah, well...

993
00:46:07,463 --> 00:46:09,299
You go like this.

994
00:46:09,332 --> 00:46:11,401
Then you just press play.

995
00:46:11,434 --> 00:46:13,403
- It turns on.
- Huh.

996
00:46:13,436 --> 00:46:14,538
This.

997
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:16,373
Huh, look at that.

998
00:46:18,508 --> 00:46:19,843
That's fancy.

999
00:46:19,876 --> 00:46:21,244
- Ah.
- There you go.

1000
00:46:21,277 --> 00:46:22,879
<i>Goes around so fast.</i>

1001
00:46:22,912 --> 00:46:25,282
<i>What's that music, huh?</i>

1002
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:26,550
<i>The guy... Victor...</i>

1003
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:29,853
He turned me onto this when I was away.

1004
00:46:29,886 --> 00:46:32,360
It's got something to it.
It holds my attention.

1005
00:46:33,556 --> 00:46:34,591
Huh?

1006
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:35,580
I like it.

1007
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:37,060
<i>Yeah.</i>

1008
00:46:37,093 --> 00:46:38,595
<i>See, what happened is,</i>

1009
00:46:38,628 --> 00:46:41,097
there was these guys back in Cuba

1010
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:42,432
in the '40s and the '50s,

1011
00:46:42,465 --> 00:46:44,367
like that.

1012
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,469
They, um...

1013
00:46:46,502 --> 00:46:48,271
They were superstars.

1014
00:46:48,304 --> 00:46:50,574
And these guys, a couple of years ago,

1015
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:53,844
went down to Cuba and got
these guys together,

1016
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:55,579
and they made a record.

1017
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:57,013
<i>Mm-hmm?</i>

1018
00:46:57,046 --> 00:46:59,349
And so this is the record over here.

1019
00:46:59,382 --> 00:47:01,051
It's really... I don't know what it is.

1020
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:04,254
I don't know why it gets me like that.

1021
00:47:04,287 --> 00:47:06,857
No, it's good. It's like, uh...

1022
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,491
It's authentic.

1023
00:47:08,524 --> 00:47:10,861
- It sounds genuine.
- <i>Yeah yeah.</i>

1024
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:13,296
This here record was made a few years ago,

1025
00:47:13,329 --> 00:47:15,332
but it sounds like it was made

1026
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:17,267
just, uh, back in the '50s.

1027
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,603
Has that feel, you know?

1028
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:21,238
<i>Just has that thing.</i>

1029
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:22,873
Yeah, it's good. It's, uh...

1030
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:23,946
It's authentic. I like it.

1031
00:47:23,973 --> 00:47:25,976
I mean... it's good.

1032
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,544
<i>Yeah.</i>

1033
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,614
So, Bobby...

1034
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:34,050
What do you remember about me?

1035
00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:35,919
What do you mean?

1036
00:47:35,952 --> 00:47:37,921
You know what I mean.

1037
00:47:42,191 --> 00:47:45,195
I don't know. I mean, I was
just a kid when you went away.

1038
00:47:45,228 --> 00:47:47,364
I used to hear more things after you left

1039
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:48,665
than when you were around.

1040
00:47:48,698 --> 00:47:52,669
But, I mean, you were like a hero to us.

1041
00:47:52,702 --> 00:47:55,272
<i>We all loved you.
We all wanted to be like you,</i>

1042
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:58,909
<i>dress like you and have a car like Mr. Joe.</i>

1043
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:00,477
I mean, even me. Everybody.

1044
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,913
We all loved you. We still do.

1045
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:05,015
Everybody's glad you're back, you know?

1046
00:48:08,217 --> 00:48:09,920
That's nice to hear, Bobby,

1047
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:11,688
but I'm just an old man now

1048
00:48:11,721 --> 00:48:14,557
with a heart that don't work

1049
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:16,627
and a dyke for a daughter...

1050
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,562
<i>And a parole officer spic</i>

1051
00:48:19,595 --> 00:48:21,464
who comes around here
and takes great pleasure

1052
00:48:21,497 --> 00:48:23,033
in busting my fuckin 'balls.

1053
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:25,602
- <i>Spic cocksucker.</i>
- Oh, come on.

1054
00:48:25,635 --> 00:48:27,270
The "old" part is right.

1055
00:48:27,303 --> 00:48:30,574
Hey, watch it.

1056
00:48:34,644 --> 00:48:37,044
What happened?
Something happen with you and, uh...

1057
00:48:37,046 --> 00:48:38,482
You and Rita?

1058
00:48:40,316 --> 00:48:42,920
Yeah. We had an argument.

1059
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:47,590
When she told me that she was a lesbian,

1060
00:48:47,623 --> 00:48:50,327
<i>that she had a girlfriend.</i>

1061
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,095
You know anything about that?

1062
00:48:53,763 --> 00:48:56,533
Mr. Joe, with all due respect, I, uh...

1063
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:58,101
I try to mind my business,

1064
00:48:58,134 --> 00:49:00,103
and I want people to mind their business.

1065
00:49:00,136 --> 00:49:01,638
She's my neighbor, I love her,

1066
00:49:01,671 --> 00:49:03,974
I known her my whole life. But, you know...

1067
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:06,409
I stay out of everybody's way, you know?

1068
00:49:06,442 --> 00:49:08,712
Hmm. It's a good attitude, Bobby.

1069
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:11,481
<i>You'd have made a good wiseguy.</i>

1070
00:49:14,769 --> 00:49:17,454
Well, you know,
kids aren't afraid to tell anything.

1071
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:19,222
When I was a kid,

1072
00:49:19,255 --> 00:49:21,057
if I got a bad mark on a report card,

1073
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:22,726
I was afraid I was getting
a fuckin' beating

1074
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:24,761
from my mother and my
father when he got home.

1075
00:49:24,794 --> 00:49:27,364
I know, I know. I remember.
I had the same thing.

1076
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:29,477
<i>Today the kids don't...
they're not afraid of anything.</i>

1077
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:32,736
"Daddy, I got a... I shoot heroin.

1078
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:36,706
Daddy, I'm a fag.
Daddy, I gotta have a sex change,

1079
00:49:36,739 --> 00:49:39,309
psychotherapy...
" what the fuck happened here?

1080
00:49:39,342 --> 00:49:41,211
What happened to these fuckin' kids?

1081
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:43,580
There's nothin'...
what happened to these fuckin' kids?

1082
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:47,050
Yeah, it's all fucked up.
There's no more filters.

1083
00:49:47,083 --> 00:49:48,785
There's no more respect.

1084
00:49:48,818 --> 00:49:51,688
None. It's crazy. It's changed.

1085
00:49:51,721 --> 00:49:53,056
<i>It's nuts.</i>

1086
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,059
Yeah.

1087
00:49:56,092 --> 00:49:57,732
The world's going to shit. I got nothin'.

1088
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,130
My life is a mess. I got a...

1089
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:03,533
No wife, no money.

1090
00:50:03,566 --> 00:50:05,568
<i>I'm sick.</i>

1091
00:50:05,601 --> 00:50:08,071
<i>I can't go nowhere 'cause I got no license.</i>

1092
00:50:08,104 --> 00:50:09,639
I can't get no license.

1093
00:50:09,672 --> 00:50:14,344
The feds took 7,481 days out of my life.

1094
00:50:14,377 --> 00:50:16,246
Shit.

1095
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:18,114
<i>They should've just let me die there.</i>

1096
00:50:18,147 --> 00:50:19,482
No. Come on, don't say that.

1097
00:50:19,515 --> 00:50:20,817
<i>Would've been better, Bobby.</i>

1098
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:22,052
No, come on.

1099
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:23,386
Bobby, I can't make it out here.

1100
00:50:23,419 --> 00:50:25,388
I don't know what I'm doing.

1101
00:50:25,421 --> 00:50:27,224
I just feel that, uh...

1102
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:31,161
I can't function right.

1103
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,763
<i>I'm not the same man.</i>

1104
00:50:34,014 --> 00:50:36,699
And something happened.
Maybe prison softened me up,

1105
00:50:36,732 --> 00:50:38,435
I don't know, but I...

1106
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:41,772
I'm reflecting on a lot of shit that I did.

1107
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:44,508
A lot of shit.

1108
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,445
And I don't, uh...

1109
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:50,513
<i>I don't know how to come to terms with it,</i>

1110
00:50:50,546 --> 00:50:52,049
<i>if you know what I mean.</i>

1111
00:50:59,522 --> 00:51:02,192
But the worst thing I done, see...

1112
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,094
I lied to my daughter.

1113
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:07,831
I told her her mother was dead.

1114
00:51:09,765 --> 00:51:12,202
<i>I shouldn't have done that.</i>

1115
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,536
<i>Her mother was a drug addict,</i>

1116
00:51:13,569 --> 00:51:15,238
<i>so I wanted to keep them apart, you know.</i>

1117
00:51:15,271 --> 00:51:17,574
But I deprived my daughter...

1118
00:51:19,321 --> 00:51:20,743
Of the image of her mother.

1119
00:51:20,776 --> 00:51:22,479
How's she gonna be a woman

1120
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:24,114
without the image of her mother?

1121
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:25,515
And I did that.

1122
00:51:25,548 --> 00:51:27,150
Maybe that's why she went gay.

1123
00:51:27,183 --> 00:51:29,185
No, that's not true.

1124
00:51:29,218 --> 00:51:30,387
<i>I don't know.</i>

1125
00:51:34,757 --> 00:51:36,893
My daughter.

1126
00:51:36,926 --> 00:51:39,162
My little baby daughter.

1127
00:51:43,499 --> 00:51:46,736
That's the worst thing I ever done.

1128
00:52:22,872 --> 00:52:25,208

Mr. dibianco,

1135
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,975
could you step out of
the car for us, please?

1136
00:52:59,008 --> 00:53:00,877
Sure.

1137
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:02,645
You guys can just call me Bobby.

1138
00:53:02,678 --> 00:53:05,515
<i>- All right, got it.
- You got it.</i>

1139
00:53:05,548 --> 00:53:07,951
Officers Butler and O'Bannon, right?

1140
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:09,586
- Agent.
- Agent.

1141
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,321
Sorry.

1142
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,388
How are we doing today?

1143
00:53:12,421 --> 00:53:13,756
- We're doing good.
- Yeah?

1144
00:53:13,789 --> 00:53:14,924
- How can I help you?
- Things are good?

1145
00:53:14,957 --> 00:53:16,960
Everything's just fine.
Just taking care of some errands.

1146
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:18,728
Good.
We just happened to be in the neighborhood

1147
00:53:18,761 --> 00:53:19,796
and wanted to ask a few questions.

1148
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:22,599
- Okay.
- Maybe you've got some extra information

1149
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:24,467
on our good friend Mr. Scoleri,

1150
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,636
who he's been talking to.

1151
00:53:26,669 --> 00:53:28,705
- Uh...
- Forgive me... Mr. Joe.

1152
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:31,307
No, I don't have any new
information on him.

1153
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,243
Just the same old stuff. But, I mean,

1154
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:35,311
you guys can't keep harassing me

1155
00:53:35,344 --> 00:53:37,680
just because I'm friends
with someone you're looking 'at.

1156
00:53:37,713 --> 00:53:40,683
We're talking about an old man,
a harmless old man.

1157
00:53:40,716 --> 00:53:42,785
He's dying.
You sent him home for that, right?

1158
00:53:42,818 --> 00:53:44,420
Butler was being insensitive.

1159
00:53:44,453 --> 00:53:46,322
Didn't mean anything by it.

1160
00:53:46,355 --> 00:53:49,359
He was raised in an... Alternate household.

1161
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,960
Okay.

1162
00:53:50,993 --> 00:53:53,029
Listen, I've had one question

1163
00:53:53,062 --> 00:53:54,697
going on in my mind for a while,

1164
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:57,000
and I'm glad I got the
opportunity to ask you.

1165
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:58,801
What is it?

1166
00:53:58,834 --> 00:54:01,004
- Why is it that your people...
- my people?

1167
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:02,805
Yeah. Your people are okay

1168
00:54:02,838 --> 00:54:05,908
with Mr. Scoleri reaching
his hand into their pockets

1169
00:54:05,941 --> 00:54:07,944
and bleeding these
mom-and-pop businesses dry

1170
00:54:07,977 --> 00:54:09,545
while he got fat.

1171
00:54:09,578 --> 00:54:12,715
Not to mention the beatings,
the intimidation,

1172
00:54:12,748 --> 00:54:14,317
the occasional murder.

1173
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:15,550
I don't know what to tell you.

1174
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,353
My family never had that problem.

1175
00:54:17,386 --> 00:54:19,355
- Hmm.
- Wonder why that is.

1176
00:54:19,388 --> 00:54:21,991
What do you mean? What are you insinuating?

1177
00:54:22,024 --> 00:54:23,426
Nothin'.

1178
00:54:24,927 --> 00:54:26,863
- Okay. All right.
<i>- Yeah, forget it.</i>

1179
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:29,399
Okay, this is a nice neighborhood, right?

1180
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,867
You look around this neighborhood.

1181
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,435
You don't see any drug-dealers
around any corners.

1182
00:54:32,468 --> 00:54:34,070
Nobody's getting their houses broken into.

1183
00:54:34,103 --> 00:54:36,839
That's partially because
of guys like Mr. Scoleri.

1184
00:54:36,872 --> 00:54:38,074
There's a certain amount of respect

1185
00:54:38,107 --> 00:54:40,043
that they bring to the neighborhood.

1186
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:41,711
Maybe you guys are in the wrong place.

1187
00:54:41,744 --> 00:54:43,713
Maybe you're in the wrong neighborhood.

1188
00:54:43,746 --> 00:54:45,448
So we should be in the black
and Latino neighborhoods?

1189
00:54:45,481 --> 00:54:47,817
I didn't say that. Did I say that?

1190
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:49,619
- Sound like it.
- Yeah, I think you insinuated it.

1191
00:54:49,652 --> 00:54:52,388
I wasn't insinuating anything.

1192
00:54:52,421 --> 00:54:54,424
Well, this has been an educational

1193
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:55,537
and inspiring conversation.

1194
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:56,659
I appreciate your time.

1195
00:54:56,692 --> 00:54:57,727
So we're all done?

1196
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:58,828
We're done here for today.

1197
00:54:58,861 --> 00:55:00,396
I'm gonna let you know something.

1198
00:55:00,429 --> 00:55:01,431
If you guys keep harassing me,
I'm telling you,

1199
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,032
I'm gonna file a civil suit.

1200
00:55:03,065 --> 00:55:04,334
I appreciate that warning.

1201
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:06,369
'Cause so far, you guys are 0-for-2.

1202
00:55:06,402 --> 00:55:07,770
- Good luck.
- All right.

1203
00:55:07,803 --> 00:55:09,523
- We're swinging for the fences.
- All right.

1204
00:55:09,538 --> 00:55:11,374
Next time, if you want to just say hello,

1205
00:55:11,407 --> 00:55:13,443
just say hello.
We don't even have to stop the car.

1206
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:14,844
<i>Have a good day.</i>

1207
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:34,530
Mr. Joe.

1208
00:55:34,563 --> 00:55:36,599
Hey, Bobby! How are you, young fellow?

1209
00:55:36,632 --> 00:55:38,701
The question is, how are you?
What's going on?

1210
00:55:38,734 --> 00:55:40,570
I'm fine. I'm making the gravy.

1211
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:42,038
Oh, yeah? Looks like you're making a sauce.

1212
00:55:42,071 --> 00:55:44,474
No, it's not a sauce. It's a gravy.

1213
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:47,643
No, no, no, no. That's a sauce for pasta.

1214
00:55:47,676 --> 00:55:50,413
Yeah. That's a gravy for macaroni.

1215
00:55:50,446 --> 00:55:51,606
You know what I call you guys?

1216
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:53,116
I call you "yuppie Italians."

1217
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:55,451
Oh, oh, oh! With the yuppies.

1218
00:55:55,484 --> 00:55:57,520
I'm saying that's a sauce you put on pasta,
right?

1219
00:55:57,553 --> 00:55:59,689
Very nice. Let me explain
to you what it is.

1220
00:55:59,722 --> 00:56:01,457
- What do you got in there?
- So you learn something.

1221
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:03,426
- What is it?
- You can do it in your deli.

1222
00:56:03,459 --> 00:56:06,529
Look, I brown the meat.
This is beef, pork and veal.

1223
00:56:06,562 --> 00:56:08,398
I browned it in olive oil.

1224
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:09,999
But it's gotta be not extra virgin,

1225
00:56:10,032 --> 00:56:11,734
'cause extra virgin gets bitter.

1226
00:56:11,767 --> 00:56:13,870
So you use regular imported nice olive oil.

1227
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:15,571
- Right.
- And now...

1228
00:56:15,604 --> 00:56:18,174
We browned it, we take it out.

1229
00:56:18,207 --> 00:56:20,643
The flavor of the oil

1230
00:56:20,676 --> 00:56:22,145
is coming from the meat.

1231
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:25,615
Now you add a couple of handfuls
of nice chopped onions.

1232
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:27,583
You see? Nice. Beautiful.

1233
00:56:27,616 --> 00:56:29,452
The meat...

1234
00:56:29,485 --> 00:56:32,688
Has imbued its flavor into the olive oil.

1235
00:56:32,721 --> 00:56:34,457
Right. Imbued.

1236
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:35,958
- That's a good word, isn't it?
- Imbued.

1237
00:56:35,991 --> 00:56:38,895
And you let them stay
there on a small flame.

1238
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:40,463
And you let them caramelize.

1239
00:56:40,496 --> 00:56:41,664
You know what "caramelize" is, right?

1240
00:56:41,697 --> 00:56:42,865
I know what it is.

1241
00:56:42,898 --> 00:56:46,002
All right, now, when that's finished,

1242
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:47,904
you put a little basil,
too, right in there.

1243
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:49,906
- I like to even cook it from there.
- Mm-hmm.

1244
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:51,874
Then I'm gonna put in the tomatoes,

1245
00:56:51,907 --> 00:56:53,976
which I will crush with my hands.

1246
00:56:54,009 --> 00:56:56,679
All right. Make sure you wash your hands.

1247
00:56:56,712 --> 00:56:58,881
Little bastard.

1248
00:56:58,914 --> 00:57:00,216
A little salt and pepper.

1249
00:57:00,249 --> 00:57:02,652
I'm gonna make sure
I have it on a nice simmer

1250
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:06,122
so it goes, "plop, plop, plop, plop."

1251
00:57:06,155 --> 00:57:08,758
And that's it.
You don't put nothing else in it.

1252
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:11,694
That's the only ingredients.
No garlic, no sugar. No.

1253
00:57:11,727 --> 00:57:13,596
And it's done. Nice.

1254
00:57:13,629 --> 00:57:15,465
The best thing you ever ate in your life.

1255
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:16,999
And it is not called a sauce.

1256
00:57:17,032 --> 00:57:18,568
It's a gravy.

1257
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:21,180
Well, whatever it is,
it smells like a good sauce.

1258
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:23,973
Pain in the ass.

1259
00:57:24,006 --> 00:57:25,575
<i>How you feeling? You all right?</i>

1260
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,143
I feel good.

1261
00:57:27,176 --> 00:57:29,245
- Bobby, I gotta ask you a favor.
- All right, what is it?

1262
00:57:29,278 --> 00:57:31,013
<i>I gotta reach out to some
old friends of mine,</i>

1263
00:57:31,046 --> 00:57:32,548
<i>if you know what I'm talking about.</i>

1264
00:57:32,581 --> 00:57:35,718
There's a guy name of Louie Lapresa

1265
00:57:35,751 --> 00:57:37,720
from forest Avenue, the bakery.

1266
00:57:37,753 --> 00:57:39,155
<i>Is he still around?</i>

1267
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:43,025
Yeah, I see him.
I know who you're talking 'about.

1268
00:57:43,058 --> 00:57:45,027
- <i>Yeah. All right.</i>
- I... he's around.

1269
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,929
See, I have to have a sit-down

1270
00:57:46,962 --> 00:57:48,798
with some of these guys
who are still around.

1271
00:57:48,831 --> 00:57:51,033
I want to ask you to go pass...

1272
00:57:51,066 --> 00:57:53,569
Oh, no, Mr. Joe. I, uh...

1273
00:57:53,602 --> 00:57:55,104
I don't feel comfortable doing that.

1274
00:57:55,137 --> 00:57:56,606
I don't want to talk to Lapresa.

1275
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:57,974
What are you talking about?

1276
00:57:58,007 --> 00:57:59,609
You don't even know what
I was gonna ask you.

1277
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:02,211
Yeah, but I think I do, and...

1278
00:58:02,244 --> 00:58:04,213
Not for nothing, I mean, I can't...

1279
00:58:04,246 --> 00:58:06,749
You'd go to jail just for
speaking to those guys, right?

1280
00:58:06,782 --> 00:58:08,184
Fuck jail.

1281
00:58:08,217 --> 00:58:09,919
I just did 20 years. 20.

1282
00:58:09,952 --> 00:58:11,754
I could do another 20 standing on my head.

1283
00:58:11,787 --> 00:58:13,923
They're never gonna kill this thing.

1284
00:58:13,956 --> 00:58:15,658
Well, that's fine, you know.

1285
00:58:15,691 --> 00:58:17,059
You might not be scared of jail,

1286
00:58:17,092 --> 00:58:18,961
but I am, Mr. Joe.

1287
00:58:18,994 --> 00:58:20,596
That's... That's not for me.

1288
00:58:20,629 --> 00:58:22,031
I can't do that.

1289
00:58:22,064 --> 00:58:23,700
I got a family.

1290
00:58:27,636 --> 00:58:29,572
Let me ask you a question.

1291
00:58:29,605 --> 00:58:31,607
Do you think you can be half-pregnant?

1292
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,142
Is that what you think?

1293
00:58:33,175 --> 00:58:34,744
Look, I... I'm not gonna do that.

1294
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:36,279
I can't do that, Mr. Joe.

1295
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:39,181
I mean, taking you to the grocery
store and to the doctor...

1296
00:58:39,214 --> 00:58:41,684
That's fine.
But I'm not gonna pass along any messages

1297
00:58:41,717 --> 00:58:43,886
<i>or talk to somebody that's
gonna get me in trouble,</i>

1298
00:58:43,919 --> 00:58:46,604
<i>or you in trouble, for that matter.
I can't do that.</i>

1299
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:49,692
You know I got a guy following me

1300
00:58:49,725 --> 00:58:51,861
in an unmarked car every now and then?

1301
00:58:51,894 --> 00:58:54,330
And the fuckin' F.B.I...
They showed up at my house...

1302
00:58:54,363 --> 00:58:56,599
<i>And at the job...</i>

1303
00:58:56,632 --> 00:58:58,200
<i>Asking me all kinds of crazy shit.</i>

1304
00:58:58,233 --> 00:59:00,102
<i>I'm just... I'm a working guy.</i>

1305
00:59:00,135 --> 00:59:01,837
<i>I don't do that stuff.</i>

1306
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:04,340
What fuckin' F.B.I.?!

1307
00:59:04,373 --> 00:59:05,808
What guys are following you?

1308
00:59:05,841 --> 00:59:07,944
Are you a fuckin' rat now? Is that it?

1309
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:09,879
You got nothing on me!

1310
00:59:16,775 --> 00:59:18,354
This is getting weird, Mr. Joe.

1311
00:59:18,387 --> 00:59:19,889
I gotta... I gotta go.

1312
00:59:19,922 --> 00:59:21,090
Don't you walk away from me

1313
00:59:21,123 --> 00:59:22,625
<i>when I'm talking!</i>

1314
00:59:22,658 --> 00:59:24,660
<i>Don't you disrespect me!</i>

1315
00:59:24,693 --> 00:59:26,293
You forgot who you're talking to, right?

1316
00:59:26,295 --> 00:59:28,230
I'm a fuckin' legend in this neighborhood!

1317
00:59:28,263 --> 00:59:31,200
No, you were a legend! You're not a legend.

1318
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,136
You're just an old guy with a bad heart.

1319
00:59:34,169 --> 00:59:36,839
<i>You can't talk to me like that.
We're friends.</i>

1320
00:59:36,872 --> 00:59:38,941
<i>I don't need this shit.
I got a family, Mr. Joe.</i>

1321
00:59:38,974 --> 00:59:40,810
I'm not gonna stand here
and let you scream at me.

1322
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:42,245
I gotta go.

1323
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,014
Have a good one.

1324
00:59:49,406 --> 00:59:51,354
Yeah, you go! You get out of my house!

1325
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:53,289
Don't you ever fuckin' come back!

1326
00:59:53,322 --> 00:59:55,091
You're dead to me!

1327
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:56,659
Fuckin' mutt!

1328
01:00:01,296 --> 01:00:02,699
Fucking guy.

1329
01:00:13,709 --> 01:00:17,680
<i>Grant that we may possess
the gift of charity</i>

1330
01:00:17,713 --> 01:00:19,849
<i>for which you have taught us to hope</i>

1331
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:22,818
<i>through Christ our lord.</i>

1332
01:00:22,851 --> 01:00:25,788
Please stand and let us pray.

1333
01:00:34,363 --> 01:00:36,232
The lord be with you.

1334
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:39,168
And with your spirit.

1335
01:00:39,201 --> 01:00:41,937
<i>May almighty God bless you,</i>

1336
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:45,708
<i>the father and the son and the holy spirit.</i>

1337
01:00:45,741 --> 01:00:47,176
Amen.

1338
01:00:47,209 --> 01:00:49,045
Our mass is over now.

1339
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:51,280
Let us go in peace to love

1340
01:00:51,313 --> 01:00:53,315
and to serve the lord.

1341
01:00:53,348 --> 01:00:55,751
Thanks be to God.

1342
01:00:55,784 --> 01:00:58,706
- Oh, hey. How's it going?
- Good. How are you doing?

1343
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:00,356
- Good.
- Good to see you.

1344
01:01:00,389 --> 01:01:02,124
Oh, Liv, you're beautiful.

1345
01:01:02,157 --> 01:01:04,193
When I grow up, I want
to look just like you.

1346
01:01:04,226 --> 01:01:05,795
Thank you.

1347
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,396
What's going on? How's your dad?

1348
01:01:07,429 --> 01:01:09,832
He's miserable. You know, he's a tough guy.

1349
01:01:09,865 --> 01:01:11,467
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

1350
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,436
He misses you coming around, you know.

1351
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:16,172
I don't know. Tell him I said hello.

1352
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:17,907
- I'm gonna make him call you.
- All right.

1353
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,408
When he's ready.

1354
01:01:19,441 --> 01:01:20,843
- No big deal.
- All right.

1355
01:01:20,876 --> 01:01:22,878
So what are you doing today?

1356
01:01:22,911 --> 01:01:25,014
The usual... my mother's for Sunday dinner.

1357
01:01:25,047 --> 01:01:26,816
- Sounds nice.
- We eat like pigs.

1358
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:28,751
Pigs, yeah. I wish I could come,

1359
01:01:28,784 --> 01:01:30,953
but I gotta go or the old
man's gonna blow a gasket.

1360
01:01:30,986 --> 01:01:32,955
So I'll see you later.

1361
01:01:33,964 --> 01:01:35,491
Bye, sweetie. Nice to see you.

1362
01:01:35,524 --> 01:01:36,926
- Have a good day.
- We'll talk later.

1363
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:38,260
Bye.

1364
01:01:52,274 --> 01:01:54,110
<i>- You remember?
- I remember it.</i>

1365
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:56,846
<i>It was live.
I remember it 'cause it was live.</i>

1366
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,514
<i>He comes running up with the camera...
Geraldo?</i>

1367
01:01:58,547 --> 01:02:00,082
Yeah. And he says to fat Tony,

1368
01:02:00,115 --> 01:02:01,317
with his cigar in his mouth...

1369
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:02,818
He goes, "what do you got to say, Tony?"

1370
01:02:02,851 --> 01:02:04,904
"What do I gotta say? Go fuck yourself."

1371
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,490
- Hello, boys.
- Hey, look who's...

1372
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:09,125
- Mr. Joe.
- Mr. Joe, how are you?

1373
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:10,727
How are you?

1374
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,262
- Hello.
- Hey, Vinnie, carmine.

1375
01:02:13,295 --> 01:02:15,765
- Good to see you.
- You, too. Anthony.

1376
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:17,366
<i>How are things at home, carmine?</i>

1377
01:02:17,399 --> 01:02:19,502
Everybody's good. I got my son,

1378
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:22,171
his wife, the kids.
They bought a house on long island.

1379
01:02:22,204 --> 01:02:23,773
My daughter just had a baby.

1380
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:29,044
Me and the wife,
we're still stuck in the neighborhood.

1381
01:02:29,077 --> 01:02:31,814
We love it here.
Hey, we're still slaving for Bobby.

1382
01:02:31,847 --> 01:02:34,817
Yeah, busting our humps
for Bobby over here.

1383
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:36,250
How about yourself? You look great.

1384
01:02:36,251 --> 01:02:37,887
One day at a time, Vinnie.

1385
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,889
Some days chickens, some days feathers.

1386
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,824
But I... One day at a time.

1387
01:02:41,857 --> 01:02:43,893
- True, true.
- All right. Anyway...

1388
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,161
Give my love at home.

1389
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:46,796
Let me get this for you.

1390
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:48,331
- All right.
- Absolutely.

1391
01:02:49,498 --> 01:02:51,033
Wow.

1392
01:02:51,066 --> 01:02:52,334
Look at him.

1393
01:03:04,613 --> 01:03:06,882
No no no, don't worry about it.

1394
01:03:06,915 --> 01:03:10,119
- I insist.
- No, it's only $1.

1395
01:03:11,887 --> 01:03:13,989
It says $1.99.

1396
01:03:14,022 --> 01:03:15,925
It's half-off day.

1397
01:03:29,872 --> 01:03:31,473
<i>Take care of your health, yeah?</i>

1398
01:03:31,506 --> 01:03:33,876
Stay well, Mr. Joe.

1399
01:03:33,909 --> 01:03:35,594
- Okay.
- Thanks for stopping in.

1400
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:46,622
- What?
- There was something...

1401
01:03:46,655 --> 01:03:47,489
Something going on over there?

1402
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:49,258
So, what, are you breakin' balls? Huh?

1403
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:51,360
Little ball-breaker? Look at this guy.

1404
01:03:51,393 --> 01:03:52,862
He's the president of the ball-breakers.

1405
01:03:52,895 --> 01:03:54,296
- B.B.U.
- B.B.U.

1406
01:03:54,329 --> 01:03:56,498
- Skinny Vinnie the Guinea.
- Skinny Vinnie.

1407
01:03:56,531 --> 01:03:58,868
You guys have a little relationship...

1408
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:00,603
- You guys mind your business.
- Little troubles?

1409
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:02,071
A little girl fight?

1410
01:04:02,104 --> 01:04:03,539
Shut your mouth.

1411
01:04:03,572 --> 01:04:04,974
No respect.

1412
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:11,948
Dad, I'm home.

1413
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,500
Hey. Hey, dad. How was your day?

1414
01:04:31,533 --> 01:04:34,370
Good.

1415
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:35,938
What's this?

1416
01:04:35,971 --> 01:04:37,339
They're flowers.

1417
01:04:37,372 --> 01:04:38,908
- For who?
- You.

1418
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:41,477
- From who?
- Me.

1419
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:42,678
- For me?
- Yes.

1420
01:04:42,711 --> 01:04:44,981
- From you?
- Yes.

1421
01:04:46,081 --> 01:04:47,383
Would you read the card?

1422
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:01,530
I, uh...

1423
01:05:01,563 --> 01:05:03,332
I'm no good at this.

1424
01:05:05,233 --> 01:05:07,003
And, uh...

1425
01:05:10,038 --> 01:05:13,008
I have to apologize to you

1426
01:05:13,041 --> 01:05:15,377
because of what I did

1427
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:18,447
in telling you that your mother was dead.

1428
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,683
It was a stupid mistake.

1429
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:23,419
I knew at that time that you and she...

1430
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:24,954
She shouldn't be near you

1431
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:28,524
because of the problems
that she was going through.

1432
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:31,260
But it was stupid of me
to tell you she was dead,

1433
01:05:31,293 --> 01:05:34,697
and I'm very sorry. I was wrong.

1434
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:38,133
Now, about the other day in the park.

1435
01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:41,070
The things that I said about you...

1436
01:05:42,337 --> 01:05:45,975
And the things that I said
about your girlfriend...

1437
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:50,546
I don't know if you could ever believe me,

1438
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:53,048
if you could ever find it in your heart

1439
01:05:53,081 --> 01:05:55,050
to forgive me.

1440
01:05:55,083 --> 01:05:57,586
But if you could,

1441
01:05:57,619 --> 01:06:01,390
I would be so completely honored

1442
01:06:01,423 --> 01:06:03,592
to go to a restaurant

1443
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:06,161
with you and your girlfriend

1444
01:06:06,194 --> 01:06:08,431
if I could still be invited.

1445
01:06:13,101 --> 01:06:15,137
Yeah. Yeah, dad.

1446
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:17,006
You're still invited.

1447
01:06:19,174 --> 01:06:20,743
I love you, daddy.

1448
01:06:20,776 --> 01:06:22,044
I love you.

1449
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:25,047
Yeah.

1450
01:06:33,455 --> 01:06:35,290
Did you make dinner for me or what?

1451
01:06:35,323 --> 01:06:37,092
Well, naturally.

1452
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:09,485
Bobby?

1453
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:17,392
Hello?

1454
01:08:17,425 --> 01:08:19,261
<i>Hey, Michelle, it's Rita.</i>

1455
01:08:19,294 --> 01:08:20,762
Hey, Rita, how's your dad?

1456
01:08:20,795 --> 01:08:22,865
- <i>He's hanging in there.</i>
- Oh, good.

1457
01:08:22,898 --> 01:08:24,900
<i>I have a huge favor for Bobby.</i>

1458
01:08:24,933 --> 01:08:26,468
<i>Okay, what do you need?</i>

1459
01:08:26,501 --> 01:08:28,270
<i>I'm stuck at work right now.</i>

1460
01:08:28,303 --> 01:08:31,206
<i>I'm done, but by the time I leave,
I'm gonna get back late,</i>

1461
01:08:31,239 --> 01:08:33,408
<i>and I really need him
to take my dad to the doctor.</i>

1462
01:08:33,441 --> 01:08:35,177
<i>This is an important one.</i>

1463
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:36,545
<i>Yeah, sure, that should be no problem.</i>

1464
01:08:36,578 --> 01:08:38,178
<i>I'll call you back if there's a problem,</i>

1465
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:39,314
<i>but it should be fine.</i>

1466
01:08:39,347 --> 01:08:40,649
<i>Thank you so much. I owe you.</i>

1467
01:08:40,682 --> 01:08:42,217
<i>You're welcome. Talk to you later.</i>

1468
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:43,719
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

1469
01:09:13,715 --> 01:09:16,852
<i>Joe!</i>

1470
01:09:16,885 --> 01:09:18,721
Mr. Joe!

1471
01:09:20,889 --> 01:09:23,258
You broke into my house.
I'm calling the cops.

1472
01:09:23,291 --> 01:09:26,228
I didn't break in.
You don't hear me banging on the door?

1473
01:09:26,261 --> 01:09:28,197
You better get out. I'm
gonna call the cops.

1474
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:30,766
All right, call the cops. I'm sure
they're gonna rush over here for you.

1475
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:32,434
How you feeling? You all right?

1476
01:09:32,467 --> 01:09:34,436
- I feel 100%.
- <i>You good?</i>

1477
01:09:34,469 --> 01:09:36,572
All right, Rita called,
said you got a doctor's appointment,

1478
01:09:36,605 --> 01:09:38,740
so I'm gonna take you today, okay?

1479
01:09:38,773 --> 01:09:40,876
I'll die before I get in a car with you.

1480
01:09:42,877 --> 01:09:44,913
You're not gonna come with me?

1481
01:09:44,946 --> 01:09:45,914
You're not gonna get in the car with me?

1482
01:09:45,947 --> 01:09:48,851
Look, I'm your neighbor.
I'm not going anywhere.

1483
01:09:51,683 --> 01:09:53,789
Come on, Mr. Joe. You can't be mad at me.

1484
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:55,557
You're acting like a big baby.

1485
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:57,993
A big, giant Italian baby.

1486
01:09:58,026 --> 01:10:00,662
Keep it up. Keep disrespecting me.
Keep it up.

1487
01:10:00,695 --> 01:10:02,264
<i>You're not gonna come with me?</i>

1488
01:10:02,297 --> 01:10:05,334
All right, I'm gonna wait
downstairs until you're ready,

1489
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:06,935
and if you don't show up,
they're gonna charge you,

1490
01:10:06,968 --> 01:10:08,704
<i>so we gotta go.</i>

1491
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:13,375
Come on.
You can't be mad at me forever, all right?

1492
01:10:13,408 --> 01:10:15,444
Let's go. We gotta go.

1493
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:16,912
I'm gonna be waiting downstairs.

1494
01:10:16,945 --> 01:10:18,780
Sunny day.

1495
01:10:18,813 --> 01:10:20,749
Time to get moving.

1496
01:10:20,782 --> 01:10:22,685
Everybody loves the sunshine.

1497
01:10:25,553 --> 01:10:27,990
A beautiful day in the neighborhood.

1498
01:10:32,027 --> 01:10:33,362
Come on!

1499
01:10:42,337 --> 01:10:44,006
Don't... stop...

1500
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:46,375
Stop honking the fuckin' horn!

1501
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:48,744
Mr. Joe!

1502
01:10:51,646 --> 01:10:53,015
All the frigging honking.

1503
01:10:53,048 --> 01:10:54,648
You're disturbing the whole neighborhood.

1504
01:10:54,649 --> 01:10:56,051
Can I please take you to the doctor?

1505
01:10:56,084 --> 01:10:57,386
We're not going anywhere.

1506
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:58,720
My daughter's coming to pick me up.

1507
01:10:58,753 --> 01:10:59,953
- No, she's not.
- Yes, she is.

1508
01:10:59,954 --> 01:11:01,456
- I just called...
- I just spoke to her.

1509
01:11:01,489 --> 01:11:03,325
- She's not coming.
- What's the difference?

1510
01:11:03,358 --> 01:11:05,394
I'm not getting in the car with no rat.

1511
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:06,995
- Are you being serious?
- You're a rat.

1512
01:11:07,028 --> 01:11:08,397
You know you're a rat.

1513
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,365
How am I a rat? Look, Mr. Joe,

1514
01:11:10,398 --> 01:11:12,067
come on, I took off of work to take you.

1515
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,335
We gotta go.

1516
01:11:17,939 --> 01:11:20,309
All right, but not another fuckin' word.

1517
01:11:20,342 --> 01:11:22,311
No words.

1518
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:24,046
All right? Come on, let me help you down.

1519
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:25,869
- I am not an invalid.
- All right.

1520
01:11:27,899 --> 01:11:29,584
I don't believe this fuckin' guy.

1521
01:11:29,617 --> 01:11:30,819
<i>Let me get the door.</i>

1522
01:11:30,852 --> 01:11:32,321
Get away from that door.

1523
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:34,356
<i>I won't get the fuckin' door.</i>

1524
01:11:34,389 --> 01:11:36,425
<i>Pain in the ass, this fuckin' guy.</i>

1525
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:37,859
Unbelievable.

1526
01:11:40,395 --> 01:11:41,730
<i>Vaffanculo!</i>

1527
01:11:43,698 --> 01:11:46,435
You don't open the frigging door?
What's the matter with you?

1528
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:48,937
Don't know how to operate a fuckin'
automobile?

1529
01:11:51,373 --> 01:11:53,075
You good? All right.

1530
01:11:54,142 --> 01:11:56,611
Get your seat belt.

1531
01:12:30,945 --> 01:12:32,514
Get outta here!

1532
01:13:00,311 --> 01:13:01,943
You don't have to wait with me.

1533
01:13:01,976 --> 01:13:03,445
Yeah, I know.

1534
01:13:03,478 --> 01:13:04,679
So what are you still doing here?

1535
01:13:04,712 --> 01:13:07,182
Rita asked me to stay here so
I could tell her what the doctor says.

1536
01:13:07,215 --> 01:13:09,751
- I can tell her.
- She just wanted to make sure

1537
01:13:09,784 --> 01:13:11,820
<i>you don't forget any details.</i>

1538
01:13:11,853 --> 01:13:14,490
You kids. I'm telling you.

1539
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:25,801
Are you incapable of
apologizing for something?

1540
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:28,170
I am not incapable of anything.

1541
01:13:28,203 --> 01:13:30,739
You tell me what I'm supposed
to apologize for, okay?

1542
01:13:30,772 --> 01:13:32,174
- Tell me that.
- For what happened the other day.

1543
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:34,176
Do you think I'm gonna think less of you

1544
01:13:34,209 --> 01:13:36,578
or people will think less
of you if you say sorry?

1545
01:13:36,611 --> 01:13:39,181
Come on, Bobby.
You think I really give a shit

1546
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:40,916
about what people think about me anymore?

1547
01:13:40,949 --> 01:13:42,517
Yeah, I do. I do think that.

1548
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:44,486
Can I just have a second, please?

1549
01:13:46,742 --> 01:13:48,690
I do think you care what people think.

1550
01:13:48,723 --> 01:13:50,225
And that's okay. That's normal.

1551
01:13:50,258 --> 01:13:52,461
It's normal. So now you're a psychiatrist?

1552
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:54,196
No, I'm just... I'm
trying to be your friend.

1553
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:55,631
Jesus.

1554
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:02,237
You know why I said no to
you a few weeks ago, right?

1555
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:04,139
It's because I'm not getting in trouble

1556
01:14:04,172 --> 01:14:06,608
for passing along a stupid message for you.

1557
01:14:06,641 --> 01:14:09,010
<i>And you shouldn't want to
risk going back to jail</i>

1558
01:14:09,043 --> 01:14:11,112
<i>for sending a message.</i>

1559
01:14:11,145 --> 01:14:12,848
<i>That's crazy.</i>

1560
01:14:17,986 --> 01:14:19,087
Hello?

1561
01:14:25,325 --> 01:14:27,062
You know, I don't have to be here.

1562
01:14:27,095 --> 01:14:29,865
I don't need to be
doing these things for you.

1563
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:31,633
I have other things I could be doing.

1564
01:14:31,666 --> 01:14:34,236
<i>I have a family. I have a daughter.</i>

1565
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:36,571
<i>I'm doing it because I want to,</i>

1566
01:14:36,604 --> 01:14:38,039
<i>not because I have to.</i>

1567
01:14:38,072 --> 01:14:40,008
<i>'Cause I like you.</i>

1568
01:14:40,041 --> 01:14:41,877
<i>But you're not my boss.</i>

1569
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:44,012
You know that, right?

1570
01:14:44,045 --> 01:14:46,215
Those days are over for you.

1571
01:14:50,363 --> 01:14:52,521
Got me driving around here like I'm crazy.

1572
01:14:52,554 --> 01:14:54,022
<i>And you scream at me?</i>

1573
01:15:00,628 --> 01:15:02,297
Are you hearing me? Are you...

1574
01:15:02,330 --> 01:15:04,065
Is this making any sense to you?

1575
01:15:04,098 --> 01:15:06,309
I just need to know that you're hearing me.

1576
01:15:17,345 --> 01:15:19,047
I was out of line.

1577
01:15:20,648 --> 01:15:23,151
I just hope you know who I am, Bobby.

1578
01:15:26,254 --> 01:15:27,923
And I'm sorry.

1579
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:34,830
Well, I apologize, too.

1580
01:15:36,197 --> 01:15:38,133
And I appreciate you saying it.

1581
01:15:47,642 --> 01:15:49,578
By the way, it's a sauce.

1582
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:51,646
<i>It's not gravy.</i>

1583
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:54,616
Jesus. It's a gravy, wise-ass.

1584
01:15:54,649 --> 01:15:58,086
No. Gravy you pour on
turkeys on Thanksgiving.

1585
01:15:58,119 --> 01:15:59,988
Sauce you put on other things.

1586
01:16:00,021 --> 01:16:02,324
Yeah, that's right. Now you're an American.

1587
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:03,659
Yeah.

1588
01:16:06,127 --> 01:16:09,097
Look, if this doctor's gonna do the old,
you know,

1589
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:10,632
cough and juggle the nuts,

1590
01:16:10,665 --> 01:16:12,033
can I leave?

1591
01:16:12,066 --> 01:16:14,202
Fuckin' idiot.

1592
01:16:14,235 --> 01:16:18,206
They got golf,
they got 14,000 swimming pools,

1593
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:20,108
90,000 resorts.

1594
01:16:20,141 --> 01:16:22,644
- Nah. Where am I going?
- Boca.

1595
01:16:22,677 --> 01:16:24,179
- Nah.
- Tampa bay.

1596
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:25,814
- Clearwater.
- Miami beach.

1597
01:16:25,847 --> 01:16:28,116
I got my pension. My house is paid.

1598
01:16:28,149 --> 01:16:30,919
I got the kids nearby. For what?!

1599
01:16:30,952 --> 01:16:32,621
I'm just saying.
You could get, like, a mansion down there,

1600
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:34,254
especially since the market took a shit.

1601
01:16:34,255 --> 01:16:35,657
It took, like, a diarrhea.

1602
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:37,292
Listen, I was down there already.

1603
01:16:37,325 --> 01:16:39,327
We went to visit my wife's sister's family.

1604
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,830
And I'm telling you, her husband...

1605
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:43,798
I swear to God, you look at this guy,

1606
01:16:43,831 --> 01:16:46,668
he's, like...
they're waiting to call his number.

1607
01:16:46,701 --> 01:16:48,101
Pull a ticket, time to go. Go ahead.

1608
01:16:48,102 --> 01:16:50,405
- He was gonna die?
- It's as hot as Vietnam.

1609
01:16:50,438 --> 01:16:52,040
- Nah, nah, nah.
- It's hot up here.

1610
01:16:52,073 --> 01:16:53,642
My grandkids are in the neighborhood.

1611
01:16:53,675 --> 01:16:55,677
- Nah, I'm not going.
- Got grandkids.

1612
01:17:03,117 --> 01:17:04,919
If you guys don't want me in here,

1613
01:17:04,952 --> 01:17:06,721
- just say the word.
- Aww!

1614
01:17:06,754 --> 01:17:08,423
- Then get the fuck out.
<i>- Come here.</i>

1615
01:17:08,456 --> 01:17:10,158
- I'm serious.
- Come here.

1616
01:17:10,191 --> 01:17:12,111
- What's the matter with you?
- We want you here.

1617
01:17:12,126 --> 01:17:14,729
- Come on.
- What's up, fellas?

1618
01:17:14,762 --> 01:17:16,402
- How you doing, Anthony?
- How you doing?

1619
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:19,367
How you doing? Vin, how are you?

1620
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,737
Hey, Bobby.

1621
01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:24,673
Oh. Carmine.

1622
01:17:24,706 --> 01:17:27,075
What a big surprise.

1623
01:17:28,476 --> 01:17:30,145
So how's life?

1624
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:31,913
Good, good, good. How's things?

1625
01:17:31,946 --> 01:17:33,782
How's business, Dom. You all right?
Everything good?

1626
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:35,417
How's business? If I tell you,

1627
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:37,719
you think you're gonna let
the whole neighborhood know?

1628
01:17:37,752 --> 01:17:40,689
Ah, Dom, what's with you?

1629
01:17:42,256 --> 01:17:43,892
What's with me?

1630
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:46,695
Dom, what...

1631
01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:47,996
What's the matter? What's wrong with you?

1632
01:17:48,029 --> 01:17:49,798
What's wrong with me?

1633
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:51,933
Who the fuck are you to
talk to me like that?

1634
01:17:51,966 --> 01:17:53,468
- Dominic, come on.
- No no, hold on a second.

1635
01:17:53,501 --> 01:17:55,070
Hold on a second, Bobby.

1636
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:56,705
Carmine obviously has something

1637
01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:58,173
that he wants to say to me.

1638
01:17:58,206 --> 01:17:59,741
Why don't you relax?

1639
01:17:59,744 --> 01:18:00,741
<i>Sit down, Vinnie.</i>

1640
01:18:00,742 --> 01:18:02,277
Did I offend you?

1641
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:05,413
Yeah, people that gossip
too much offend me.

1642
01:18:05,446 --> 01:18:06,815
All right, dom, what can I get for you?

1643
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:08,116
I know what you can get me.

1644
01:18:08,149 --> 01:18:09,851
Get me a fuckin' bat

1645
01:18:09,884 --> 01:18:12,320
so I can shut this washer
woman up for good.

1646
01:18:12,353 --> 01:18:13,955
- <i>You fuckin' gossiping prick.</i>
- All right, you gotta go.

1647
01:18:13,988 --> 01:18:16,291
- You gotta go, Dominic.
- I gotta go?

1648
01:18:16,324 --> 01:18:18,460
Dom, your old man ain't around anymore.

1649
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:19,961
You can't talk to people like that.

1650
01:18:19,994 --> 01:18:21,830
Are you fuckin' talking about my father?!

1651
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:24,199
- Dom, now you gotta go!
- That's it. Oh yeah?

1652
01:18:24,232 --> 01:18:26,000
You think 'cause you're running
errands for the old man,

1653
01:18:26,033 --> 01:18:27,301
- you can talk to me like that?
- Yeah, I think that.

1654
01:18:27,335 --> 01:18:29,504
- Who the fuck are you talking to?
- What's the matter with you?

1655
01:18:29,537 --> 01:18:31,840
- You think it's the ninth grade?
- Watch your fuckin' mouth.

1656
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:35,210
And you... I should've buried
you a long fuckin' time ago!

1657
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:36,811
- Bobby, what's going on here?
- Don't worry about it.

1658
01:18:36,844 --> 01:18:39,180
Rita, mind your own business!
The men are talking.

1659
01:18:39,213 --> 01:18:40,482
Don't talk to me like that.

1660
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:42,884
- Your old man...
- Are you crazy?

1661
01:18:42,917 --> 01:18:44,753
- Your old man is washed up.
- Dominic!

1662
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:46,054
Mind your own business! Shut the fuck up!

1663
01:18:46,087 --> 01:18:47,889
- Fuck you!
- You fuckin' dyke!

1664
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:53,929
Now you gotta go!

1665
01:18:55,329 --> 01:18:57,232
Now you're going! Now you're going!

1666
01:18:57,265 --> 01:18:58,900
Yeah, you're an asshole!

1667
01:18:58,933 --> 01:19:00,301
Get the fuck out of here!

1668
01:19:00,334 --> 01:19:02,003
Rita!

1669
01:19:02,036 --> 01:19:04,405
Shit. Sit down, sit down. Rita, come here.

1670
01:19:04,438 --> 01:19:06,841
You want to get... I'll fuckin' kill you!

1671
01:19:06,874 --> 01:19:08,376
Hey! Carmine's having a heart attack!

1672
01:19:08,409 --> 01:19:10,478
- What?!
- He's having a heart attack!

1673
01:19:35,903 --> 01:19:37,839
We're so sorry, Angela.

1674
01:19:37,872 --> 01:19:39,374
Thank you for being here.

1675
01:19:39,407 --> 01:19:40,967
If you need anything, just let us know.

1676
01:19:40,975 --> 01:19:42,243
Thanks, Bobby.

1677
01:19:42,276 --> 01:19:44,245
He really loved you guys, you know?

1678
01:19:44,278 --> 01:19:45,446
We loved him.

1679
01:19:45,479 --> 01:19:46,599
And he missed your dad a lot

1680
01:19:46,614 --> 01:19:48,416
once he moved down to Florida.

1681
01:19:48,449 --> 01:19:49,884
I know. My father called.

1682
01:19:49,917 --> 01:19:51,920
He told me tell you that he's...

1683
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:53,521
He's heartbroken.

1684
01:19:53,554 --> 01:19:55,156
Thanks, Bobby.

1685
01:19:55,189 --> 01:19:56,925
You'll send him my love, won't you?

1686
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:58,493
Yeah yeah, I will.

1687
01:19:58,526 --> 01:20:01,062
We'll be here if you need anything, okay?

1688
01:20:01,095 --> 01:20:02,397
Okay.

1689
01:20:05,166 --> 01:20:07,202
Love you.

1690
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:08,870
Love you, too.

1691
01:20:10,504 --> 01:20:11,540
Angela.

1692
01:20:21,382 --> 01:20:22,517
Mario.

1693
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:23,885
Mr. Joe.

1694
01:20:31,926 --> 01:20:35,297
Mm-hmm.

1695
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:26,081
Hmm?

1696
01:22:13,721 --> 01:22:16,564
- Hey, what's up?
- Oh my God, Rita. Look at your face.

1697
01:22:16,597 --> 01:22:18,032
Yeah, I know.

1698
01:22:18,065 --> 01:22:19,567
I never liked dom, Jr.,

1699
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:22,437
even when he was a kid.
Couldn't stand the effing guy.

1700
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:25,039
- I hear he could get charged with something.
- No, not for this.

1701
01:22:25,072 --> 01:22:27,075
- Yeah, tell her that thing you heard.
- What?

1702
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:28,977
That thing you told me. Tell her.

1703
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:31,045
- What are you talking about?
- That thing, tell her.

1704
01:22:31,078 --> 01:22:32,480
- What thing did you hear?
- It's nothing.

1705
01:22:32,513 --> 01:22:34,182
It was a rumor I heard in the deli.

1706
01:22:34,215 --> 01:22:36,117
<i>What did you hear?</i>

1707
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:38,686
I heard that... I overheard somebody saying

1708
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:40,621
that he's been cooperating for a while.

1709
01:22:40,654 --> 01:22:42,690
- It could be totally...
- No shit.

1710
01:22:42,723 --> 01:22:45,026
- Yeah.
- I knew he was good-for-nothin'.

1711
01:22:45,059 --> 01:22:47,195
Don't tell your father
you heard that from me,

1712
01:22:47,228 --> 01:22:49,163
'cause I don't even know if it's true.

1713
01:22:49,196 --> 01:22:52,300
Bobby, I would never tell my
father in a million years.

1714
01:22:52,333 --> 01:22:54,235
- <i>You're a great guy.</i>
- Okay.

1715
01:22:54,268 --> 01:22:56,004
I gotta go check on my dad.

1716
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:57,672
All right. We'll see you later.

1717
01:22:57,705 --> 01:22:59,407
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1718
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,675
- What did I do?
- What do you mean, what did you do?

1719
01:23:00,708 --> 01:23:02,028
Why would you bring that up here?

1720
01:23:02,043 --> 01:23:03,277
<i>- Why would you even say...
- Did you see her face?</i>

1721
01:23:03,311 --> 01:23:06,715
<i>Why would you say something like that?</i>

1722
01:23:13,354 --> 01:23:15,056
Who was it, daddy?

1723
01:23:15,089 --> 01:23:17,058
Don't worry. He's not on the list.

1724
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:26,127
What's the matter, dad? You look nervous.

1725
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:27,862
This is an important night for you.

1726
01:24:27,895 --> 01:24:29,497
I don't want to screw it up.

1727
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:31,199
And also, what if somebody sees me?

1728
01:24:31,232 --> 01:24:33,334
Dad, you could never screw it up,

1729
01:24:33,367 --> 01:24:36,304
and nobody's gonna see you here, okay?

1730
01:24:39,206 --> 01:24:40,308
You happy?

1731
01:24:42,676 --> 01:24:44,145
Yeah.

1732
01:24:44,178 --> 01:24:45,813
Yeah, I'm happy.

1733
01:24:45,846 --> 01:24:47,215
I'm a little nervous right now.

1734
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:48,716
- You, too?
- Yeah.

1735
01:24:48,749 --> 01:24:50,318
We're nervous together.

1736
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:55,190
I think she's here.

1737
01:25:03,230 --> 01:25:04,265
Dad.

1738
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:07,293
No.

1739
01:25:07,493 --> 01:25:09,203
Okay.

1740
01:25:09,236 --> 01:25:12,640
Besides, I have a little surprise for you.

1741
01:25:14,157 --> 01:25:16,210
Go easy, all right? This is a lot for me

1742
01:25:16,243 --> 01:25:17,411
to take in one night.

1743
01:25:17,444 --> 01:25:18,680
Okay.

1744
01:25:20,948 --> 01:25:22,417
She's here.

1745
01:25:32,593 --> 01:25:33,895
How are you?

1746
01:25:33,928 --> 01:25:35,630
Good, thank you.

1747
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:38,299
Dad, um...

1748
01:25:38,332 --> 01:25:41,269
This is Anna, and Anna's my girlfriend.

1749
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:42,870
<i>I'm sorry. I should've told you.</i>

1750
01:25:42,903 --> 01:25:44,572
You're not mad, are you?

1751
01:25:46,807 --> 01:25:50,244
No, she's, uh...

1752
01:25:50,277 --> 01:25:52,246
She's your... She's your, uh...

1753
01:25:52,279 --> 01:25:54,315
Yes, dad, she's my girlfriend.

1754
01:25:54,348 --> 01:25:56,817
So nice to meet you again... formally.

1755
01:25:56,850 --> 01:25:58,219
You, too.

1756
01:25:58,252 --> 01:25:59,787
I hope you're not mad at us.

1757
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:01,189
I'm not mad, no.

1758
01:26:01,222 --> 01:26:02,957
Rita missed you quite a bit, and...

1759
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:04,926
Well, she couldn't wait for me to meet you.

1760
01:26:04,959 --> 01:26:07,762
Well, she's a great girl. Everything...

1761
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:10,231
I mean, her happiness is everything to me.

1762
01:26:10,264 --> 01:26:12,600
- You're not mad?
- I'm not mad.

1763
01:26:12,633 --> 01:26:15,236
She's so beautiful.

1764
01:26:16,983 --> 01:26:18,773
<i>Let's sit down and order some wine.</i>

1765
01:26:18,806 --> 01:26:19,941
Yeah. A bottle of Amarone.

1766
01:26:19,974 --> 01:26:23,244
- Let's have some wine.
- Sounds good.

1767
01:26:24,678 --> 01:26:26,948
You've done good.

1768
01:26:26,981 --> 01:26:28,716
Well, I'm...

1769
01:26:28,749 --> 01:26:30,484
I don't know what to say.

1770
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:32,987
Me, either.

1771
01:26:34,255 --> 01:26:35,823
- Is this...
- Let's order some wine.

1772
01:26:35,856 --> 01:26:37,225
Is this what "awkward" means?

1773
01:26:37,258 --> 01:26:39,393
Hey, over here. Come here, come here.

1774
01:26:39,426 --> 01:26:40,995
This is what "awkward" means, right?

1775
01:26:41,028 --> 01:26:42,430
Yes, it is.

1776
01:26:45,899 --> 01:26:49,637
Uh, you know, back in the day,

1777
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:52,473
we didn't see things the
way we see them now.

1778
01:26:52,506 --> 01:26:57,345
And I'm an old-fashioned guy.
I'm not gonna change that way.

1779
01:26:57,378 --> 01:26:58,879
But I am gonna change,

1780
01:26:58,912 --> 01:27:01,315
because I have found...

1781
01:27:01,348 --> 01:27:03,651
The world is not gonna change,

1782
01:27:03,684 --> 01:27:05,553
so I have to change.

1783
01:27:05,586 --> 01:27:08,522
But the only reason to change is beca...

1784
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:14,028
Because my daughter's happiness

1785
01:27:14,061 --> 01:27:15,830
is the most important thing to me.

1786
01:27:15,863 --> 01:27:17,865
Nothing else matters in my life right now.

1787
01:27:17,898 --> 01:27:19,734
Thank you, dad.

1788
01:27:19,767 --> 01:27:21,769
Thank you for saying that.

1789
01:27:21,802 --> 01:27:23,771
I appreciate that.

1790
01:27:27,975 --> 01:27:29,910
Okay.

1791
01:27:29,943 --> 01:27:33,514
So now let's get onto
a more important subject.

1792
01:27:33,547 --> 01:27:37,018
Okay? Now, this subject
has to be spoken of.

1793
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:40,721
So, in my researches, if you will,

1794
01:27:40,754 --> 01:27:43,024
I found that it is medically possible

1795
01:27:43,057 --> 01:27:46,661
and in other ways it is
societally possible that, uh...

1796
01:27:46,694 --> 01:27:48,763
Dad, wait, what are you trying to say?

1797
01:27:48,796 --> 01:27:50,665
What are you trying to say, dad?

1798
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:55,570
When am I gonna see a grandchild?

1799
01:27:57,471 --> 01:27:58,539
What?

1800
01:28:01,008 --> 01:28:02,843
Whoa.

1801
01:28:07,414 --> 01:28:09,083
- Okay.
- Wow.

1802
01:28:09,116 --> 01:28:11,952
You got me, now I got you.

1803
01:28:11,985 --> 01:28:14,722
- You got us, dad. You definitely got us.
- He's spunky.

1804
01:28:14,755 --> 01:28:17,425
I'm very serious. I'm an old Sicilian man.

1805
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:18,793
I got a right.

1806
01:28:22,029 --> 01:28:23,931
I don't know what to say.

1807
01:28:25,099 --> 01:28:27,335
It's possible. I know it is.

1808
01:28:27,368 --> 01:28:30,004
- Dad, we'll work on it.
- We will?

1809
01:28:30,037 --> 01:28:31,837
Yeah, we're gonna work on it.
We'll work on it.

1810
01:28:31,839 --> 01:28:34,642
- Okay, we'll work on it.
- Yeah.

1811
01:28:34,675 --> 01:28:37,078
Makes me happy.

1812
01:28:45,853 --> 01:28:47,988
Let's go, Frankie!

1813
01:28:48,021 --> 01:28:49,623
<i>Let's go!</i>

1814
01:28:49,656 --> 01:28:51,893
Come on, Frank, let's see what you got.

1815
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:54,595
<i>Break the ball, baby!</i>

1816
01:28:56,663 --> 01:28:58,366
- Hey.
- Hey.

1817
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:00,534
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

1818
01:29:00,567 --> 01:29:02,002
Come on, Frank.

1819
01:29:02,035 --> 01:29:03,704
<i>Frank the tank!</i>

1820
01:29:03,737 --> 01:29:05,539
There you go, Frankie!

1821
01:29:05,572 --> 01:29:08,576
Run this one out. Here you go, Frankie!

1822
01:29:08,609 --> 01:29:11,679
All right, Frankie.
You're making me look bad.

1823
01:29:11,712 --> 01:29:13,814
Come on, baby!

1824
01:29:13,847 --> 01:29:16,083
Come on, babe! Hit one out of the park!

1825
01:29:16,116 --> 01:29:18,653
Baby, get the heating pad ready.

1826
01:29:42,976 --> 01:29:44,661
Come on, give me something nice.

1827
01:29:46,647 --> 01:29:48,015
<i>Be nice. Something nice.</i>

1828
01:29:49,406 --> 01:29:50,985
It's all right. It's all right.

1829
01:29:51,018 --> 01:29:52,954
Next one, next one.

1830
01:30:30,224 --> 01:30:31,759
All right, let's go!

1831
01:31:22,446 --> 01:31:24,078
We had a little problem, right?

1832
01:31:24,111 --> 01:31:25,980
Yeah, but, you know, it's all fine.

1833
01:31:26,013 --> 01:31:27,882
- I wanted to talk to you for a while now.
- Sure.

1834
01:31:27,915 --> 01:31:30,217
I've been trying to talk
to Bobby, get you...

1835
01:31:30,250 --> 01:31:31,586
Yeah, me, too.

1836
01:31:36,823 --> 01:31:39,927
Let me hit something. Let me hit something.

1837
01:31:48,302 --> 01:31:49,737
Hey!

1838
01:31:50,904 --> 01:31:52,106
Hey!

1839
01:32:04,585 --> 01:32:05,586
Joe!

1840
01:32:05,619 --> 01:32:07,722
Joe! What happened?

1841
01:32:09,923 --> 01:32:12,593
- Bobby, what happened?
- Go! Take the baby!

1842
01:32:12,626 --> 01:32:14,662
<i>Call for help! Frankie!</i>

1843
01:32:16,063 --> 01:32:17,831
Hey. Go help.

1844
01:32:17,864 --> 01:32:19,900
Dominic!

1845
01:32:19,933 --> 01:32:22,636
Hey! Help!

1846
01:32:22,669 --> 01:32:24,271
Dominic!

1847
01:32:28,141 --> 01:32:29,610
Hey, keep breathing.

1848
01:32:29,643 --> 01:32:31,245
Hey! Breathe.

1849
01:32:32,245 --> 01:32:34,649
Joe, you gotta breathe.

1850
01:32:36,083 --> 01:32:39,119
Joe. Dominic.

1851
01:32:39,152 --> 01:32:40,655
Hey!

1852
01:32:41,688 --> 01:32:43,090
Get help!

1853
01:33:09,683 --> 01:33:12,653
<i>What the... What is this thing here?</i>

1854
01:33:12,686 --> 01:33:14,688
<i>I feel like I'm wearing a wire, sweetheart.</i>

1855
01:33:14,721 --> 01:33:18,359
<i>I don't know why you're making me do this.</i>

1856
01:33:18,392 --> 01:33:21,195
<i>Okay, I think it might be on. I don't know.</i>

1857
01:33:21,228 --> 01:33:23,631
<i>I've never done this before,
but what the fuck?</i>

1858
01:33:23,664 --> 01:33:25,966
<i>I'm sorry, I don't mean to... bad language.</i>

1859
01:33:25,999 --> 01:33:27,735
<i>You want, uh...</i>

1860
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:29,737
<i>You wanted me to do an electronic journal,</i>

1861
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:33,741
<i>so here you go.
What else am I gonna do in here?</i>

1862
01:33:33,774 --> 01:33:35,976
<i>I wish I could say this
to you face to face,</i>

1863
01:33:36,009 --> 01:33:38,746
<i>but obviously I don't
have much of a choice.</i>

1864
01:33:38,779 --> 01:33:41,081
<i>How's things out there? How are you?</i>

1865
01:33:41,114 --> 01:33:42,883
<i>How's your love life?</i>

1866
01:33:42,916 --> 01:33:45,185
<i>You know how much I love you, right?</i>

1867
01:33:45,218 --> 01:33:47,655
<i>I'm looking at a concrete block wall,</i>

1868
01:33:47,688 --> 01:33:50,758
<i>wondering what it's gonna
be like when I'm back home.</i>

1869
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:53,327
<i>I'll be out of here next year sometime,
you know.</i>

1870
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:56,030
<i>I can't wait to see you.</i>

1871
01:33:56,063 --> 01:33:57,931
<i>I know you're probably disappointed in me,</i>

1872
01:33:57,964 --> 01:34:00,067
<i>and I can understand why, honey.</i>

1873
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:02,336
<i>There's so many things I want to tell you,</i>

1874
01:34:02,369 --> 01:34:04,405
<i>but I'll start here.</i>

1875
01:34:04,438 --> 01:34:07,741
<i>I am sorry I wasn't the
father you always dreamt of.</i>

1876
01:34:07,774 --> 01:34:09,410
<i>I'm old-school.</i>

1877
01:34:09,443 --> 01:34:11,679
<i>I live by a code I can't explain.</i>

1878
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:15,182
<i>I'm a street guy, and I
got myself into this.</i>

1879
01:34:15,215 --> 01:34:17,251
<i>I promise I'll do whatever I can</i>

1880
01:34:17,284 --> 01:34:20,187
<i>to make our time together
special when I get home.</i>

1881
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:22,089
<i>I promise you, honey.</i>

1882
01:34:22,122 --> 01:34:24,458
<i>Okay, I'm gonna change the subject now,</i>

1883
01:34:24,491 --> 01:34:27,227
<i>because I don't want to get too
emotional about this thing here.</i>

1884
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:29,730
<i>Anyway, I can't wait to get out</i>

1885
01:34:29,763 --> 01:34:31,765
<i>and meet this significant other</i>

1886
01:34:31,798 --> 01:34:33,367
<i>you keep talking about.</i>

1887
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:34,968
<i>Who is this guy?</i>

1888
01:34:35,001 --> 01:34:37,905
<i>He better be handsome, or you know what.</i>

1889
01:34:37,938 --> 01:34:40,708
<i>I can't wait till you
have a kid, sweetheart.</i>

1890
01:34:40,741 --> 01:34:42,376
<i>I need at least that.</i>

1891
01:34:42,409 --> 01:34:44,144
<i>I know that that sounds selfish.</i>

1892
01:34:44,177 --> 01:34:45,846
<i>Look, I'm babbling now.</i>

1893
01:34:45,879 --> 01:34:48,816
<i>This journal stuff is making me tired.</i>

1894
01:34:48,849 --> 01:34:50,350
<i>I don't even know if this thing</i>

1895
01:34:50,383 --> 01:34:52,419
<i>is taping what I'm saying to you,</i>

1896
01:34:52,452 --> 01:34:54,421
<i>but I'm getting sleepy, sweetheart,</i>

1897
01:34:54,454 --> 01:34:56,390
<i>and the guys around here
think I'm going crazy,</i>

1898
01:34:56,423 --> 01:34:58,092
<i>talkin' to myself.</i>

1899
01:34:58,125 --> 01:34:59,960
