Okay, Bob...

33
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:35,620
Bob, are you aware that Castle has clocked
exactly one media appearance state,

34
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:39,240
and that was Walter's last interview
before she died, that would be 9 fucking years ago!

35
00:05:39,242 --> 00:05:43,022
Stop menstruating and just tell me
whether we fucking have it?

36
00:05:43,023 --> 00:05:45,138
We fucking, have it.

37
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:46,690
Good!

38
00:05:48,985 --> 00:05:51,226
Okay, focus.
Let's get lunch.

40
00:05:52,862 --> 00:05:54,720
Burger chili fried?

41
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,377
I could eat a burger.

42
00:05:58,407 --> 00:06:00,184
We live in society.

43
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,600

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,227

46

Going live in...
5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

54
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:39,106
First, there was "Society".

55
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,798
The ultimate sim environment,
where players don't control

56
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:45,226
virtual animated characters,
but actual,

57
00:06:45,227 --> 00:06:47,759
living, breathing human beings.

58
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,563
They walked them, they talked them,
they juiced them, they rocked them.

59
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,291
Rickidy dickidy doo.
We had that on t-shirts
back on 2010.

60
00:06:55,292 --> 00:06:57,568
The creation of reclusive genius
Ken Castle...

61
00:06:57,569 --> 00:06:59,233
"Who is Ken Castle?"

62
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:01,251
"Society" took the
world by storm,

63
00:07:01,252 --> 00:07:04,104
becoming the number one guilty
pleasure of billions.

64
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:06,843
You can get paid
to be controlled,

65
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,815
or you can pay to control.

66
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:11,860
And generating one of the world's
largest private fortunes,

67
00:07:11,861 --> 00:07:14,680
surpassing Bill Gates
practically, over night.

68
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,449
Nine months ago,
Castle availed a new simulation.

69
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:25,121
One that would take gaming into new heights
of thrilling excess...

70
00:07:26,027 --> 00:07:28,044
and controversy.

71
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:29,392
SLAYERS

72
00:07:29,393 --> 00:07:33,013
Slayers, if "Society" let us
live through others,

73
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:35,832
"Slayers" could let us
die through others.

74
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:40,510
Slayers gives the gamer full control
of a flesh and blood human being,

75
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:42,594
in full scale
kill or be killed combat.

76
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,806
And when we say "flesh and blood"

77
00:07:44,807 --> 00:07:49,035
We mean, flesh...
and blood.

78
00:07:56,825 --> 00:07:59,836
- Slayers.
- Slayers!

79
00:07:59,837 --> 00:08:01,695
Why isn't it murder?

80
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:06,213
Gina, when was the last time you saw someone
volunteer to be murdered?

81
00:08:06,214 --> 00:08:10,090
I'm sure you know that every last one
of our Slayers is a bonified death row inmate.

82
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:12,493
Each one offered the chance to participate
as an alternative to their sentences.

83
00:08:12,494 --> 00:08:14,900
If you stay alive for 30 sessions,
you can get set free.

84
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,451
That's not a bad goddamn deal.

85
00:08:18,546 --> 00:08:21,717
And has any of these men or women have
actually survived long enough to be set free?

86
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:25,362
Well I remind the audience that Slayers
was put together with a full cooperation

87
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:27,477
and approval, of the United States
Federal government.

88
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:29,025
That the revenue that produces...

89
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:31,524
is responsible for funding
our entire prison system...

90
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:33,735
keeping the bad guys
behind bars.

91
00:08:33,736 --> 00:08:37,067
And that the prop was voted
for by a cock solid 68% of the american public.

92
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:39,824
In an election tainted by
a suspected digital fraud.

93
00:08:39,825 --> 00:08:42,357
Let's talk about the
so called "genericons".

94
00:08:42,358 --> 00:08:44,375
Sent into the Slayers environment,

95
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:48,285
With a set of pre programmed actions,
with no one controlling them,

96
00:08:48,286 --> 00:08:51,522
and no way to react, their chances
of survival next to nil?

97
00:08:51,523 --> 00:08:54,502
There's plenty of men and women in prison
who can never cut it to Slayers

98
00:08:54,503 --> 00:08:57,867
shouldn't they be given the same chance,
roll the dice for a ticket out?

99
00:08:57,868 --> 00:09:00,144
Besides they only need to survive
one session.

100
00:09:00,145 --> 00:09:02,374
Right.

101
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,393
So Mr. Castle,
how the hell does it work?

102
00:09:04,394 --> 00:09:08,300
It begins with a single nano cell
planted in the motor cortex of the brain.

103
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:11,480
This cell can replicate,

104
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:13,690
replacing the cells around it
with perfect copies.

105
00:09:14,877 --> 00:09:18,785
And these copied cells contain
remote access functionality.

106
00:09:18,786 --> 00:09:21,637
Therefore nano plus cortex,
equals a "nanex".

107
00:09:21,638 --> 00:09:24,459
Is it true, that every human
that undergoes this procedure,

108
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,439
will have a distinct "ip" address,
like a mobile device...

109
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,361
- or a notebook computer?
- Similar, yes.

110
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:33,176
But control is strictly localized
with the parameters of our gaming environment.

111
00:09:33,177 --> 00:09:35,067
You take "Society" for instance.

112
00:09:35,068 --> 00:09:38,111
Once our cast member has left the workplace
they're completely free,

113
00:09:38,112 --> 00:09:40,388
from the control and
monitoring of their player.

114
00:09:41,349 --> 00:09:42,821
Oh well that's a relief!

115
00:09:42,822 --> 00:09:44,777
For some, maybe.

116
00:09:44,778 --> 00:09:46,328
For some...

117
00:09:51,284 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't you suspect some folks wouldn't
mind a bit of controlling?

118
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:57,275
Someone else making all the
decisions for you?

119
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:02,051
No tough choices,
no responsibilities?

120
00:10:03,911 --> 00:10:06,633
- Think about it.
- We will, Mr. Castle.

121
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:09,051
We will!

- Mr. Castle, we have no idea where this is...

We will all be his dogs if we allowed
this evolution to continue.

00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:22,574
- What?
- Sign it. Please Tillman.

172
00:15:22,575 --> 00:15:26,002
My son David is your biggest fan.
He prays for you.

173
00:15:35,247 --> 00:15:38,282
I need to prove it's authentic.
Makes it worth more.

174
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:39,872
Why would anyone want my name?

175
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:42,550
You don't even know what's
going on out there, do you?

176
00:15:42,551 --> 00:15:44,954
<i>All medical personal
report to central process.</i>

177
00:15:44,955 --> 00:15:46,827
- Damn, gotta go.
- No no! Wait,

178
00:15:46,828 --> 00:15:49,558
How did you get this picture?
Have you seen them?

179
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,934
<i>Sweat baby sweat baby
sex is a Texas drought.</i>

180
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:21,297
<i>Me and you do the kind of stuff
only Prince would sing about</i>

181
00:16:21,298 --> 00:16:25,481
<i>So put your hands down my pants
and you'll be feeling nuts</i>

182
00:16:25,482 --> 00:16:27,403
<i>Yes I'm Siskel,
yes I'm Ebert</i>

183
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,613
<i>and you're getting
two thumbs up</i>

184
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,920
<i>Come quicker than FedEx never reach an apex,
just like Coca-Cola stock you are inclined,</i>

185
00:16:31,921 --> 00:16:33,746
<i>To make me rise an hour early</i>

186
00:16:33,747 --> 00:16:36,627
<i>just like Daylight Savings Timeo</i>

187
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:40,081
<i>You and me baby
ain't nothin' but mammals</i>

188
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:44,038
<i>So let's do it like they do
on the Discovery Channell. Do it again now.</i>

189
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:47,448
<i>You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals
So let's do it</i>

190
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:51,126
<i>like they do on the Discovery Channel
Gettin' horny now</i>

191
00:17:19,387 --> 00:17:23,878
- Hey.
- Hi.

192
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,390
So what's your damage?

193
00:17:30,105 --> 00:17:33,831
You know, just hanging out.
Just looking to meet people.

194
00:17:33,832 --> 00:17:35,994
...meet people.

195
00:17:35,995 --> 00:17:39,175
Lucky you. You met me.

196
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:50,713
- I'm Nika.
- I'm Dale. I like your fur.

197
00:17:51,685 --> 00:17:55,520
- Do you wanna go somewhere?
- Do you wanna go somewhere?

198
00:17:58,008 --> 00:18:00,180
We are somewhere.

199
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:30,676
<i>Ken Castle...Is a liar.
Liar!</i>

200
00:18:31,322 --> 00:18:33,017
Fuck!

201
00:18:33,018 --> 00:18:35,496
<i>A new video prank by
the subversive group Humanz...</i>

202
00:18:35,497 --> 00:18:37,781
<i>caused a nation wide
stir today.</i>

203
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:41,469
<i>All contact between "Society" city, and
an estimated 3 quarters of a million players</i>

204
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,570
<i>were shut down for 3 hours
while Castle technicians</i>

205
00:18:44,571 --> 00:18:48,793
<i>were working on what they described as
a "satellite infection"...</i>

206
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:52,017
<i>These pranks, at first,
attributed to rogue isolated hackers </i>

207
00:18:52,018 --> 00:18:55,568
<i>are now suspected to be the work of
an elaborate and sophisticated,</i>

208
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:59,006
<i>network of programming cells,
spread around several countries.</i>

209
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:00,988
<i>Experts estimate that the service interruption</i>

210
00:19:00,989 --> 00:19:04,324
<i>will end up costing Castle
billions in lost revenue.</i>

211
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:06,470
<i>Well don't cry for Castle,
he can cover this with</i>

212
00:19:06,471 --> 00:19:08,722
<i>change in his couch cushions.</i>

213
00:19:08,723 --> 00:19:11,036
<i>On a personal note,
that shit was fucked up.</i>

214
00:19:11,037 --> 00:19:14,141
<i>Yeah it was.
I literally pissed myself.</i>

215
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:15,882
<i>Sounds like fun.</i>

216
00:19:15,883 --> 00:19:19,543
<i>Seriously, these Humanz cock suckers,
they're are out of control.</i>

217
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:32,284
- Sandra.
- Quiet.

218
00:19:33,284 --> 00:19:38,496
- My name is Sandra.
- Stop talking.

219
00:22:17,008 --> 00:22:19,288
<i>They can't say
I didn't try...</i>

220
00:23:24,206 --> 00:23:25,756
Fuck yeah!

221
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:44,910
We're all going to die!

222
00:23:53,268 --> 00:23:55,322
Get me out of here!

223
00:23:56,674 --> 00:24:00,264
I'm not supposed to be here!

224
00:24:00,265 --> 00:24:03,580
Who are they?

225
00:24:03,581 --> 00:24:09,535
Who the fuck are they?
Who the fuck is playing us man?

226
00:24:21,476 --> 00:24:23,323
Shut up, fish.

227
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:54,111
Gay, gay, gay, tardily gay.

228
00:24:54,112 --> 00:24:55,836
- Swarmers.
- Swarmers.

229
00:24:55,837 --> 00:24:57,764
The latest innovation
from Browning,

230
00:24:57,765 --> 00:24:59,520
this self detonating cartridge...

231
00:24:59,521 --> 00:25:00,986
offers the widest
and deadliest spray available...

232
00:25:01,108 --> 00:25:02,709
from a full tracking, cornering coordinates.

233
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,902
- Daddy like it.
- Simon!

234
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,274
Fan girl, stop hacking me.

235
00:25:06,275 --> 00:25:09,382
You suck Simon. You're going to get
my boyfriend killed...

236
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:12,458
before he gets out of jail and
before he can fill me up with his!

237
00:25:12,459 --> 00:25:14,091
Simon!
I just wanna play you.

238
00:25:14,092 --> 00:25:16,497
- Forget about that star fucker.
- Shut up bitch!

239
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:19,543
So when am I going to get to meet you,
for like, real?

240
00:25:19,544 --> 00:25:21,236
What's that?

241
00:25:21,915 --> 00:25:23,743
What's up looser?

242
00:25:23,744 --> 00:25:26,075
Mum says: Go to college,
move the fuck out, and...

243
00:25:26,076 --> 00:25:28,580
Oh yeah! You're a sick retard!
You're pathetic.

244
00:25:28,581 --> 00:25:29,981
You smell like Jeffrey Dahmer.

245
00:25:29,982 --> 00:25:31,785
- Wanna make out?
- You wish.

246
00:25:31,786 --> 00:25:34,027
I can't wait until they
cut you out, Simian.

247
00:25:34,028 --> 00:25:34,989
Your balls bitch.

248
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,013
- Simon?
- Maybe.

249
00:25:36,014 --> 00:25:37,585
Oh my God! Is really you!

250
00:25:37,586 --> 00:25:41,471
- Nice.
- Do you want to see our tits, Simon?

251
00:25:41,472 --> 00:25:42,232
Yes, yes I do.

252
00:25:42,233 --> 00:25:46,431
Now that we have your attention, here's
an offer that you can't refuse.

253
00:25:46,432 --> 00:25:48,641
- Here we go.
- 50 million euros...

254
00:25:48,642 --> 00:25:50,085
for control of Kable.

255
00:25:50,087 --> 00:25:53,166
instant transfer to the account
of your choice.

256
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:54,962
Kable is not for sale,
thank you.

257
00:25:54,963 --> 00:25:56,046
Baby, make a hundred...

258
00:25:56,046 --> 00:25:58,320
Spin the reel!

259
00:26:04,212 --> 00:26:06,804
What the fuck?

260
00:26:16,663 --> 00:26:22,420
If you want to talk to Kable,
we can show you how.

261
00:26:29,097 --> 00:26:31,565
Look at it.
The new face of Slayers.

262
00:26:31,566 --> 00:26:34,028
Pure, crystalized horror,

263
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:37,108
two stories high and
bathed in bloody red.

264
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:38,422
He is what they want.

265
00:26:38,423 --> 00:26:39,480
They love Kable.

266
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:40,791
They do now,

267
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:43,865
but when they watch their hero die
right in front of their eye balls...

268
00:26:43,866 --> 00:26:45,306
so sharp and vivid...

269
00:26:45,307 --> 00:26:48,198
if feels like it could've reach out and
touch the wet flesh.

270
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:52,525
They're going to change their point of view
Be seduced by the power.

271
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:56,794
The violence, the dominance.
Is human nature.

272
00:26:56,795 --> 00:26:59,543
Kable made it to 28 battles, every
player in the game is going to take him out.

273
00:26:59,544 --> 00:27:01,556
Yeah, Kable is a perfect soldier,

274
00:27:01,557 --> 00:27:03,805
he's a tactical killing computer.

275
00:27:03,806 --> 00:27:08,420
His only vulnerability is
the nanex itself. The...

276
00:27:08,421 --> 00:27:10,209
delay between Simon's commands

277
00:27:10,209 --> 00:27:13,259
and Kable's ability to execute.

278
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,310
So why should this one be any different?

279
00:27:15,311 --> 00:27:17,935
Who controls him?

280
00:27:21,594 --> 00:27:23,250
No one.

281
00:27:34,316 --> 00:27:36,421
Get it out of me!

282
00:27:55,532 --> 00:27:57,486
What the hell happened
to this one?

283
00:27:57,487 --> 00:27:59,529
Looks like he escaped.

284
00:28:03,545 --> 00:28:08,667
Hi girls. Back to your exercise.

285
00:28:16,557 --> 00:28:20,369
That's Hackman,
Hackman, Hackman, knack man.

286
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,829
They say he killed a
whole bunch of people, man.

287
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,855
Killed himself all kinds of people.

288
00:28:25,815 --> 00:28:29,565
And then one day, he just walks up
and turns himself in...

289
00:28:29,566 --> 00:28:32,734
like he wants to be inside
or some crazy shit like that.

290
00:28:32,735 --> 00:28:34,178
You know what I'm saying?

291
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:36,646
So it's going to be all
kinds of Slayers, man.

292
00:28:36,647 --> 00:28:39,817
As long as you got motherfuckers like
that running around killing...

293
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:43,853
Kable! Let's go!
Upgrades, come on.

294
00:28:46,229 --> 00:28:48,183
Why don't you upgrade
a brother man?

295
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,587
Why don't you shut the fuck up?!

296
00:28:54,562 --> 00:28:57,284
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.

297
00:28:57,285 --> 00:28:59,775
Fucking, shut the fuck up.

298
00:29:25,841 --> 00:29:28,435
- Who wimps?
- What?

299
00:29:28,436 --> 00:29:32,056
Who wimps,
the player or the slayer?

300
00:29:35,456 --> 00:29:41,031
Someone, somewhere else is the eye.

301
00:29:41,032 --> 00:29:43,146
It's tripped out, man.

302
00:29:43,147 --> 00:29:48,530
Sometimes, they take over.
Completely, they...

303
00:29:48,531 --> 00:29:51,193
move you around like a robot.

304
00:29:51,194 --> 00:29:54,459
- But that don't work so good.
- Why?

305
00:29:55,229 --> 00:29:56,894
The delay.

306
00:29:56,895 --> 00:30:00,356
Yeah the ping.
They talk about that.

307
00:30:00,357 --> 00:30:03,880
About how long it takes the
Slayer to respond to the command.

308
00:30:03,881 --> 00:30:06,193
Whatever they call it,

309
00:30:06,194 --> 00:30:11,285
the slice of a second out there,
is the difference between living and dying.

310
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:14,640
When that trigger pulls...

311
00:30:19,168 --> 00:30:21,465
it's just me.

312
00:30:42,082 --> 00:30:43,674
Hey, Kable.

313
00:30:45,095 --> 00:30:47,109
Look.

314
00:30:47,883 --> 00:30:49,966
I just killed someone.

315
00:30:50,927 --> 00:30:53,199
This is the blood.

316
00:30:55,126 --> 00:30:56,676
Look.

317
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:02,240
He's back here.

318
00:31:02,241 --> 00:31:03,803
Wanna see?

319
00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:08,575
No your head
ain't working straight.

320
00:31:12,432 --> 00:31:15,509
I'm going to kill you too,
on sunday.

321
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,790
Yeah, probably.

322
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,713
That's why they put me here.

323
00:31:18,714 --> 00:31:21,469
I got no strings.

324
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:26,179
I got no strings,
so I have fun.

325
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:29,899
I'm not tied up to anyone.

326
00:31:29,899 --> 00:31:34,224
They got strings,
but you can see,

327
00:31:35,058 --> 00:31:39,864
there are no strings on me.

328
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:41,945
You go two whores, Kable.

329
00:31:42,687 --> 00:31:45,559
- What the fuck you said?
- Outside.

330
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:50,430
I'm sorry,
I met your pretty girls.

331
00:31:51,595 --> 00:31:55,059
So you want to get back to them.

332
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,365
But I'm going to visit them first.

333
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,078
Alright.

334
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:19,041
Kable.

335
00:32:19,734 --> 00:32:23,994
Kable. Kable, dude. It's me.
It's me.

336
00:32:23,995 --> 00:32:25,117
Who?

337
00:32:25,118 --> 00:32:28,162
Simon, I'm playing you.

338
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:31,975
- How come I can hear you?
- Well it's mud.

339
00:32:31,976 --> 00:32:34,312
Gamers can't talk to cons.

340
00:32:34,313 --> 00:32:35,863
I know.

341
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:39,559
It's fucking unbelievable.
This is amazing.

342
00:32:55,483 --> 00:32:57,086
Cool yeah?

343
00:32:57,087 --> 00:32:58,805
No it's not cool.

344
00:32:59,713 --> 00:33:02,271
Pay attention to the fucking game!

345
00:33:09,714 --> 00:33:12,532
Okay, okay.
I got it, I got it.

346
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:13,783
What are you, 12?

347
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:16,664
I'm 17 actually,
thank you.

348
00:33:22,277 --> 00:33:24,262
This is unbelievable.

349
00:33:24,262 --> 00:33:27,019
How am I not dead yeat?

350
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,926
Cause I'm a badass,
motherfucker.

351
00:33:42,317 --> 00:33:44,238
Shit!

352
00:33:50,349 --> 00:33:54,374
Freek, you shouldn't be here.

353
00:34:14,355 --> 00:34:16,172
- Gibs.
- What?

354
00:34:16,173 --> 00:34:19,929
Like giblets. Chunks.
Pieces. Pieces everywhere.

355
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:22,360
These are real humans fucker.

356
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:31,202
Death row, psychos...  so what?

357
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:33,701
They had it coming anyway, right?

358
00:34:46,562 --> 00:34:48,645
I guess that goes for me too.

359
00:34:48,646 --> 00:34:50,660
Yeah, but you're different.

360
00:34:51,529 --> 00:34:53,515
Different, how?

361
00:34:53,516 --> 00:34:56,110
I don't know, because
you're in my side.

362
00:34:56,111 --> 00:34:58,864
Damn new area.

363
00:35:04,156 --> 00:35:07,360
Think about it Kable, all the shit
we've been through together,

364
00:35:07,361 --> 00:35:09,956
what an epic run, man.

365
00:35:09,957 --> 00:35:12,036
It's gonna suck to see it end.

366
00:35:12,037 --> 00:35:13,673
Are you fucking kidding me?

367
00:35:13,674 --> 00:35:17,038
Oh yeah, I get that for you is different.

368
00:35:20,309 --> 00:35:21,859
This way.

369
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,653
- There's nothing there.
- Trust me, kid.

370
00:35:26,654 --> 00:35:29,435
It's restricted area. It's beyond
the border of the game

371
00:35:29,436 --> 00:35:31,749
I couldn't put you there if I tried.

372
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,806
Warning.

373
00:35:32,807 --> 00:35:34,358
Access denied.

374
00:35:41,463 --> 00:35:44,056
Very well.

375
00:35:44,826 --> 00:35:46,514
Shit.

376
00:35:58,381 --> 00:36:00,367
Bye, Kable.

377
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:16,103
Come on.

378
00:36:16,104 --> 00:36:19,341
This kid will get me killed.

379
00:36:19,342 --> 00:36:21,292
Dude I'm right here, man.
I can hear you.

380
00:36:21,293 --> 00:36:23,731
Listen to me.

381
00:36:23,732 --> 00:36:26,230
I don't know who's behind it or why,

382
00:36:26,231 --> 00:36:30,044
but I was supposed to die tonight.
Lucky for us,

383
00:36:30,045 --> 00:36:32,639
I can beat them...

384
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,595
but not with you controlling me.

385
00:36:34,596 --> 00:36:36,197
What the hell are you talking about?

386
00:36:36,198 --> 00:36:40,684
Turn me lose, kid.
You want to win? Turn me lose.

387
00:36:40,685 --> 00:36:42,438
Find a way.

388
00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:45,782
Bastard.

389
00:36:51,517 --> 00:36:56,135
So Ms Roth. Says here you're
applying for custody of your daughter?

390
00:36:56,136 --> 00:36:58,604
Delia, her name is Delia.

391
00:36:59,373 --> 00:37:02,378
Spouse incarcerated, left without the possibility of parol.

392
00:37:02,378 --> 00:37:05,547
- You use your maiden name?
- huh-huh.

393
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:08,787
My husband, is...

394
00:37:08,788 --> 00:37:11,902
it's not entirely true
regarding his sentence.

395
00:37:11,903 --> 00:37:14,145
In fact,
he's due to be released soon.

396
00:37:14,146 --> 00:37:18,339
Ms. Roth,
your husband was charged and...

397
00:37:20,395 --> 00:37:22,670
charged and convicted
of first degree murder,

398
00:37:22,671 --> 00:37:25,262
I can't hardly
consider his release,

399
00:37:25,263 --> 00:37:29,585
or if it happened at all..
I don't think it would be a good thing.

400
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:34,363
So it's says you're an actor?

401
00:37:36,228 --> 00:37:38,822
I don't know that I've
seen you in anything.

402
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:40,925
I work in "Society".

403
00:37:41,546 --> 00:37:43,405
It's a job.

404
00:37:43,406 --> 00:37:46,034
Ms. Roth, your child has been exceedingly well placed,

405
00:37:46,034 --> 00:37:48,821
the new family is very wealthy,
she won't have to work for anything.

406
00:37:48,822 --> 00:37:51,770
Now I can understand that
you love your daughter.

407
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:55,778
Probably very much. But do you really
think she would be better off...

408
00:37:55,779 --> 00:37:57,788
with...

409
00:37:57,789 --> 00:37:59,518
people like you?

410
00:38:00,872 --> 00:38:05,196
Yes, I do.
I'm her mother.

411
00:38:08,116 --> 00:38:11,822
We will give your application on
the consideration of merits.

No shit.

419
00:38:50,565 --> 00:38:52,679
You think about
what the brother said?

420
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,666
What brother do you refer,
brother?

421
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:57,260
Kable wants the freedom to ass kick.

422
00:38:57,262 --> 00:38:58,992
Do shit his way.

423
00:38:58,993 --> 00:39:01,363
- Are you going to give it to him?
- You were listening?

424
00:39:01,364 --> 00:39:03,062
We see and hear everything...

425
00:39:03,063 --> 00:39:06,332
everything that goes on inside
that so called game.

426
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:09,409
Alright then,
Kable said we got lucky...

427
00:39:09,411 --> 00:39:12,036
They were gunning for us.
What's that all about?

428
00:39:12,037 --> 00:39:14,118
Kable got a past,
he knows things.

429
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,107
Things you don't even know.

430
00:39:16,108 --> 00:39:18,960
- What things?
- Things that Castle is afraid of.

431
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,869
As long as you boy stays on the him inside,
Castle knows he can keep him quiet.

432
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:27,676
But if he ever got out... Castle
would never let that happen.

433
00:39:27,677 --> 00:39:28,886
There's one battle left,

434
00:39:28,887 --> 00:39:30,655
I think I can handle my own business,
thank you very much.

435
00:39:30,656 --> 00:39:32,290
You're not hearing me.

436
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:35,815
This is not something you can control.

437
00:39:35,816 --> 00:39:37,706
They're gonna kill his ass, Simon.

438
00:39:37,707 --> 00:39:39,887
In the eyes of the world,
and then what?

439
00:39:39,888 --> 00:39:44,118
You're just another poor
little rich honky.

440
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:47,097
No cable, no pussy, no shit.

441
00:39:47,098 --> 00:39:52,737
Look man, this... this is too heavy. I don't
even know what the hell are you talking about.

442
00:39:52,738 --> 00:39:55,783
- I just play games, man. Games.
- That's right.

443
00:39:55,784 --> 00:39:57,674
It is a game.
You want to win, don't you?

444
00:39:57,675 --> 00:39:58,892
Yeah, I intent to.

445
00:39:58,893 --> 00:40:01,807
Then you need to cut your
strings puppet master.

446
00:40:01,808 --> 00:40:05,363
Imagine a slave that don't got
to wait to be told what to do.

447
00:40:05,364 --> 00:40:07,152
No ping, you dig?

448
00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:08,986
That would be cheating.

449
00:40:08,987 --> 00:40:11,327
A mod.
That's all it would be.

450
00:40:11,328 --> 00:40:15,300
You know why?
Because the game's got to evolve.

451
00:40:15,301 --> 00:40:18,014
- You feel me?
- I do.

452
00:40:18,858 --> 00:40:21,164
I do feel you my,
giant brother.

453
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:23,910
Well then,
let's rock baby.

454
00:40:29,371 --> 00:40:34,040
Tillman...
he knows you talked to him.

455
00:40:34,905 --> 00:40:36,826
Your player.

456
00:40:40,683 --> 00:40:43,108
- Who are you?
- A friend.

457
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:45,937
I don't have any.

458
00:40:45,938 --> 00:40:47,860
Listen to me.

459
00:40:47,861 --> 00:40:52,281
Simon is going to give you what you want.
What you asked him for.

460
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:57,859
- How do you know that?
- I know something else.

461
00:40:57,861 --> 00:41:00,192
Whether or not he's controlling you,

462
00:41:00,193 --> 00:41:03,019
you will never reach the save point.

463
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,622
Castle won't allow it.

464
00:41:04,623 --> 00:41:07,315
- We'll see.
- No, you have to escape.

465
00:41:07,316 --> 00:41:10,221
Your wife and your
daughter need you, Tillman.

466
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:13,978
If you want to get out and see
the people in the picture...

467
00:41:13,979 --> 00:41:16,284
you will have to find another way.

468
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:23,465
I need you to get me something.

469
00:41:23,466 --> 00:41:25,765
What? Tell me.

470
00:41:26,958 --> 00:41:29,996

Kill something!

482
00:43:50,696 --> 00:43:53,194

This is the last game

00:43:53,194 --> 00:43:56,076

Initial reports are that Kable,

508
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,459
the most recognizable face
of the Slayers phenomenon...

509
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:50,887
next to Ken Castle himself,

510
00:47:50,888 --> 00:47:53,170
is officially listed as fragged.

511
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:56,401
Just one session away from being
the first Slayer ever...

512
00:47:56,402 --> 00:47:59,155
to win a full pardon and release.

513
00:47:59,157 --> 00:48:02,880
And in NetCast, fledged by technical
difficulties and dead spots

514
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:05,023
the report could not be confirmed,

and convicted of murder just 4 years ago,

517
00:48:11,374 --> 00:48:15,348
has been removed from Slayers
rosters and upcoming events listings.

518
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:18,071
His player, gaming mega star, Simon Silverton,

519
00:48:18,072 --> 00:48:19,800
could not be reached for comment.

520
00:48:21,277 --> 00:48:22,719
Do you have a question?

521
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,739
Tillman left her away for the outside, right?

522
00:48:24,739 --> 00:48:28,094
- Tillman, yeah.
- Find her.

523
00:48:56,275 --> 00:48:58,831
<i>Blink, activated.</i>

524
00:49:31,632 --> 00:49:33,263
She's not home.

525
00:49:33,264 --> 00:49:37,071
But Castle's personal security will be,
soon enough and trust me...

526
00:49:37,072 --> 00:49:40,239
- You don't want to meet them.
- Who are you?

527
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,478
You asked me that once before

528
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,710
- Your voice.
- You know, you should really come with me.

529
00:49:46,767 --> 00:49:48,318
Like now!

530
00:50:41,976 --> 00:50:44,185
See that's why you're a fool!
That's what I'm talking about!

531
00:50:45,724 --> 00:50:49,373
Could you stop

532
00:50:49,374 --> 00:50:51,677
Come one man, that's why
it's a game of deception, man!

533
00:50:57,535 --> 00:50:59,551
That's bullshit, man!
You know that's bullshit!

534
00:50:59,552 --> 00:51:01,472
So you're the ones who broke me out?

535
00:51:01,473 --> 00:51:04,149
- We only freed your mind.
- And your ass follows.

536
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:05,982
Holly shit...
You made it!

537
00:51:05,983 --> 00:51:12,778
You're really here.
Kable. You're great.

538
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,290
- You got questions.
- A few.

539
00:51:18,291 --> 00:51:20,374
So she took my blood.
Why?

540
00:51:20,375 --> 00:51:22,268
The nanex.

541
00:51:22,269 --> 00:51:25,158
It modifies the actual cell
structure of your brain.

542
00:51:25,159 --> 00:51:28,973
We can crack it, but it's not one size fits all,
we need your DNA

543
00:51:28,974 --> 00:51:31,476
so that we can generate costume code.

544
00:51:31,477 --> 00:51:32,951
Alright, then why me?

545
00:51:32,952 --> 00:51:34,655
Because Castle
is afraid of you man.

546
00:51:34,656 --> 00:51:37,671
It ain't just a game, Tillman.
Every day there's more people stepping forward.

547
00:51:37,672 --> 00:51:41,227
Want to be a part of Castle's world,
throwing away everything that means to be human.

548
00:51:41,228 --> 00:51:42,991
Right now is the desperate ones.

549
00:51:42,992 --> 00:51:47,196
Convicts, addicts, the sick, the poor.
The ones that fell through the cracks.

550
00:51:47,197 --> 00:51:49,092
The federal prison system
is growing out of control.

551
00:51:49,093 --> 00:51:51,089
Set to bankrupt the whole damn USA,

552
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:53,392
then Castle rides in on a white horse

553
00:51:53,393 --> 00:51:56,343
Says he has a plan to bail us all out
and we just fall in line?

554
00:51:56,344 --> 00:51:57,925
The healthcare system is collapsing.

555
00:51:57,926 --> 00:52:00,482
And this time he's pushing for
total control over genetic diseases.

556
00:52:00,483 --> 00:52:02,469
Birth defect is no longer an issue.

557
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:04,749
All we have to do is exchange our cells
for the ones he wants to give us.

558
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,682
Promise of a longer life
and a fatter wallet...

559
00:52:06,683 --> 00:52:08,600
- Do you think people will refuse?
- Fuck no.

560
00:52:08,601 --> 00:52:10,150
Then the next thing you know...

561
00:52:12,034 --> 00:52:14,085
we're all slaves.

562
00:52:15,916 --> 00:52:17,466
I can't help you.

563
00:52:18,931 --> 00:52:21,598
Tillman.
We know where she is.

564
00:53:24,384 --> 00:53:25,934
Hi, Nika.

565
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:29,629
- Oh hi. Rick Rape, right?
- Rick Rape, right?

566
00:53:31,025 --> 00:53:33,878
I thought you weren't allowed
to come here anymore.

567
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:41,425
That was last month.
I was a bad boy.

568
00:53:44,019 --> 00:53:48,895
Are you still a bad boy?

569
00:54:44,627 --> 00:54:47,481
- Please, don't kill me.
- Please, don't kill me.

570
00:54:47,482 --> 00:54:49,220
No.

571
00:54:50,435 --> 00:54:53,091
- I'll do anything.
- Don't say that.

572
00:54:57,077 --> 00:54:58,401
Stop!

573
00:54:58,402 --> 00:55:01,380
Stop!
Goddamn it.

574
00:55:01,986 --> 00:55:05,610
You, in there controlling...
Let her talk!

575
00:55:05,611 --> 00:55:08,440
I can't she has to say what I tell her.

576
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:11,064
You can hear me.
I know you can.

577
00:55:13,659 --> 00:55:14,916
I love you.

578
00:55:14,917 --> 00:55:16,467
I love you too.

579
00:55:17,322 --> 00:55:19,092
Shut up!

580
00:55:20,114 --> 00:55:23,001
Don't say anything else.
I'm going to find you...

581
00:55:23,002 --> 00:55:25,953
and I'm going to rip you to fucking pieces,
do you understand me?

582
00:55:25,954 --> 00:55:27,919
I'm getting you out of here.

583
00:55:31,759 --> 00:55:34,578
I'm going to take you to some place
where you can turn it off, the program.

584
00:55:35,644 --> 00:55:37,512
Hi Kable.

585
00:55:51,138 --> 00:55:53,829
Look at me bitch!

586
00:55:55,759 --> 00:55:57,627
Anybody in there?

587
00:56:15,042 --> 00:56:16,911
Go on.

588
00:56:16,912 --> 00:56:18,463
Do it.

589
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,688
What the fuck do we do?

590
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:20,439
I can get you out of here.

591
00:59:30,343 --> 00:59:33,299
Oh shit!
I can't believe it's you!

592
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:38,701
This is... listen, Tillman,
you can trust me, I swear.

593
00:59:39,796 --> 00:59:43,568
If not...
you're dead!

594
00:59:43,568 --> 00:59:45,218
Okay.
Faster! Faster!

595
01:00:02,053 --> 01:00:03,443
I guess you remember that day, huh?

596
01:00:03,443 --> 01:00:07,284
You just gotten Kable through his
10th consecutive session alive.

597
01:00:08,182 --> 01:00:10,812
No one ever thought an icon could last that long.

598
01:00:10,813 --> 01:00:12,937
Pretty hot shit, aren't you?
King player.

599
01:00:12,938 --> 01:00:14,759
Good times.

600
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:18,079
Sure, on the outside.
Now look at these.

601
01:00:20,296 --> 01:00:22,126
That's what it's like on the inside.

602
01:00:22,126 --> 01:00:25,286
Wonder how long you would last
on the other side of the screen?

603
01:00:25,936 --> 01:00:28,510
You know, Simon...
you being held here today...

604
01:00:29,706 --> 01:00:32,569
suspected of aiding an escape
of a convicted murder

605
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:34,786
from a maximum security penitentiary.

606
01:00:34,787 --> 01:00:37,355
The charges are beyond serious.

607
01:00:39,533 --> 01:00:41,629
Your hard drives have been seized.

608
01:00:42,494 --> 01:00:45,661
Forensics are depicting the content
as we speak.

609
01:00:45,662 --> 01:00:48,186
Your internet activity over
the last 10 years,

610
01:00:48,187 --> 01:00:50,762
is being scrutinized and catalogued.

611
01:00:50,763 --> 01:00:52,396
In minute...

612
01:00:53,069 --> 01:00:54,744
vivid detail.

613
01:00:54,745 --> 01:00:57,668
In addition, your father's bank
accounts have been frozen,

614
01:00:57,668 --> 01:00:59,524
pending further investigation.

615
01:01:00,452 --> 01:01:04,201
After all, it was essentially his money
that funded Mr. Tillman's escape.

616
01:01:05,181 --> 01:01:06,734
Now I need you to tell me...

617
01:01:06,735 --> 01:01:09,999
everything that happened leading
up to yesterday afternoon.

618
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,469
Anybody you talked to,
everything you saw, everything you did.

619
01:01:15,526 --> 01:01:18,653
And I need you to tell me that
right now.

620
01:01:18,654 --> 01:01:20,205
Yeah, huh...

621
01:01:21,341 --> 01:01:23,598
I'm going to need something too.

622
01:01:25,867 --> 01:01:29,636
Oh really?
And what might that be?

623
01:01:30,382 --> 01:01:33,608
Could you guys do a sandwich like...

624
01:01:33,608 --> 01:01:36,816
peanut butter,
or almond butter, walnut butter...

625
01:01:36,817 --> 01:01:39,711
huh, pecan butter, pistachio butter..

626
01:01:41,328 --> 01:01:45,057
pretty much any kind of...
you know, nut butter

627
01:01:45,058 --> 01:01:46,608
with some grape jelly.

628
01:01:49,474 --> 01:01:51,360
Pistachio butter.

629
01:01:51,361 --> 01:01:54,340
- They make that?
- It's awesome.

630
01:02:08,798 --> 01:02:10,272
Now what?

631
01:02:10,272 --> 01:02:13,915
Now we just put the DNA into the suit,
light it up, extract it...

632
01:02:13,916 --> 01:02:16,539
a few modifying sequences into the code and

633
01:02:16,539 --> 01:02:17,845
we're good to go.

634
01:02:17,846 --> 01:02:20,011
- It's an anti-spyware program.
- Basically.

635
01:02:20,012 --> 01:02:22,446
We can't quarantine the foreign
cells per say, but...

636
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:25,108
we can disable their ability to transmit and receive.

637
01:02:25,109 --> 01:02:27,562
Fuck that.
I'll make you cut it out me.

638
01:02:27,564 --> 01:02:29,616
That would be like cutting out
a part of your brain.

639
01:02:29,617 --> 01:02:32,333
The nanex cells replace the cells,
they replicate.

640
01:02:32,334 --> 01:02:33,885
They become you.

641
01:02:35,487 --> 01:02:38,074
We're going to have to keep her sedated
until we kill the link.

642
01:02:38,075 --> 01:02:40,956
Otherwise she will be broadcasting
everything she sees and hears,

643
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:42,803
30 minutes.
You give us a robot...

644
01:02:42,804 --> 01:02:46,105
we give you back a super hot female.

645
01:02:46,106 --> 01:02:47,730
Tillman!

646
01:02:47,731 --> 01:02:49,281
We need to talk.

647
01:02:51,099 --> 01:02:53,177
- So talk.
- Come on.

648
01:03:01,925 --> 01:03:04,534
They tested on soldiers.

649
01:03:04,535 --> 01:03:07,042
The first volunteer was
the corporate Travis Scotch

650
01:03:07,043 --> 01:03:09,351
a friend of yours, I believe.

651
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:11,570
And the second,
it was you.

652
01:03:16,123 --> 01:03:18,418
The idea was to replace your brain,

653
01:03:19,374 --> 01:03:21,332
bit by bit,
cell by cell.

654
01:03:21,333 --> 01:03:24,750
The new tissue would never break down,
never deteriorate.

655
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:29,559
A new era in human longevity, that's what they told us.

656
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,619
9 weeks later Scotch was dead.

657
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:33,682
and you were serving life at maximum.

658
01:03:33,683 --> 01:03:35,325
Castle's project was shut down.

659
01:03:35,326 --> 01:03:37,895
But the same technology
resurfaced within a year

660
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:39,112
in a game.

661
01:03:39,113 --> 01:03:41,356
Castle called it "Society".

662
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:45,256
Tillman, listen man, whatever happened in that
project, is something Castle wanted buried.

663
01:03:45,257 --> 01:03:48,504
We need that shit man.
What you saw, what you know.

664
01:03:50,685 --> 01:03:52,147
I don't know what to tell you.

665
01:03:52,148 --> 01:03:54,083
You gotta tell me shit.

666
01:03:54,084 --> 01:03:55,684
I want you to show me.

667
01:03:58,929 --> 01:04:00,986
Okay, we're ready to rock.
We're ready to break the link in...

668
01:04:00,987 --> 01:04:03,676
3... 2... 1.

669
01:04:13,302 --> 01:04:14,853
Who's there?

670
01:04:20,415 --> 01:04:22,244
What are you doing here?

671
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:26,364
- Who are you?
- Tech support.

672
01:04:26,365 --> 01:04:27,922
SOCIETY
LINK FAILURE

673
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,911
- What are we looking at?
- His memories.

674
01:04:39,912 --> 01:04:42,581
Translating into raw audiovisual data.

675
01:04:43,984 --> 01:04:45,630
I read something about this.

676
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:48,590
But that tech is not supposed to be
available for another decade.

677
01:04:48,591 --> 01:04:51,579
They'll have better shit than
this in Best Buy in 18 months.

678
01:04:59,709 --> 01:05:02,220
Son of a bitch!
John Tillman.

679
01:05:02,221 --> 01:05:05,690
Man I never thought I would be so
happy to see your ugly face.

680
01:05:06,713 --> 01:05:09,868
Scotch.

681
01:05:11,461 --> 01:05:14,690
<i>Is it me or is this place fucked?</i>

682
01:05:15,363 --> 01:05:17,778
<i>They got me hooked up to
computers 5 hours a day.</i>

683
01:05:18,885 --> 01:05:21,731
Feed me vitamins, and pills,
and god knows what

684
01:05:21,732 --> 01:05:24,096
giving me injections, taking and giving me blood...

685
01:05:24,097 --> 01:05:28,278
These nurses are whipping my ass...
and there are male nurses to bro!

686
01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:31,399
I can't believe I let you
talk me in to this.

687
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:35,652
And I'm having these, like, blackouts...
and is scaring the shit out of me.

688
01:05:35,653 --> 01:05:37,381
I don't even know how long I've been here

689
01:05:40,234 --> 01:05:42,419
Hey man...

690
01:05:44,353 --> 01:05:46,511
<i>Are they letting you out already,
you son of a bitch?</i>

691
01:05:48,721 --> 01:05:50,562
I'm not getting out.

692
01:05:50,563 --> 01:05:52,151
Okay.

693
01:05:56,455 --> 01:05:58,652
Johnny...
Are you good?

694
01:06:00,461 --> 01:06:01,568
I'm fine.

695
01:06:01,569 --> 01:06:03,296
Man you don't look fine.

696
01:06:05,757 --> 01:06:07,047
I'm sorry.

697
01:06:07,047 --> 01:06:08,597
Yeah that's okay.

698
01:06:09,837 --> 01:06:12,149
It's not like you ever been that
good in the first place.

699
01:06:19,388 --> 01:06:20,938
What's the gun for, John?

700
01:06:20,939 --> 01:06:22,490
What's happening?

701
01:06:23,686 --> 01:06:26,034
Really you're scaring me man.
What's the gun for?

702
01:06:26,035 --> 01:06:27,432
I can't st...

703
01:06:27,433 --> 01:06:29,226
I can't stop.

704
01:06:29,227 --> 01:06:31,636
Stop what?
What did they do to you man?

705
01:06:34,228 --> 01:06:36,450
John, stop it! You're scaring me now.
Stop it.

706
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:38,001
Sorry Scotch, I...

707
01:06:39,271 --> 01:06:40,822
John, no! Don't!
Stop!

708
01:06:52,792 --> 01:06:55,074
Not the best commercial for Ken Castle.

709
01:06:55,075 --> 01:06:56,428
They made them do it.

710
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:58,301
- Castle made them do it.
- It was a test.

711
01:06:58,302 --> 01:06:59,454
Touching.

712
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:01,270
Excuse me,
media whore.

713
01:07:01,271 --> 01:07:03,086
This isn't just a story.

714
01:07:03,087 --> 01:07:05,082
The whole world is splitting down the middle.

715
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:07,392
Sooner or later,
everyone is going to have to take a side,

716
01:07:07,393 --> 01:07:08,942
even scavengers like you!

717
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,077
It's you.

718
01:07:56,369 --> 01:07:58,499
I missed you, so much!

719
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:00,688
You are the reason I held on.

720
01:08:05,654 --> 01:08:08,076
- I love you.
- Where's our daughter?

721
01:08:13,924 --> 01:08:15,651
I couldn't stop them. I'm sorry.

722
01:08:15,652 --> 01:08:17,800
Nobody could.

723
01:08:17,801 --> 01:08:21,288
The foster parents paid good money
to remain anonymous.

724
01:08:21,288 --> 01:08:23,782
But there's always a data trail
if you know where to look.

725
01:08:23,783 --> 01:08:25,125
Where is she?

726
01:08:25,126 --> 01:08:26,611
I'm sorry, Tillman.

727
01:08:26,612 --> 01:08:28,481
She's with Castle.

728
01:08:44,149 --> 01:08:45,700
Tillman!

729
01:08:47,517 --> 01:08:49,817
That's all the story
you're going to get.

730
01:09:02,535 --> 01:09:04,085
Silverton, get up.

731
01:09:06,292 --> 01:09:08,400
What's going on man?

732
01:09:08,401 --> 01:09:11,615
Looks like someone up the chain
has decided you're no longer a threat.

733
01:09:20,155 --> 01:09:22,055
CHEATER

734
01:09:22,056 --> 01:09:24,458
FUCK YOU CHEATER!

735
01:09:30,247 --> 01:09:34,586
NANEX
ACCESS DENIED

736
01:09:39,164 --> 01:09:40,837
We'll find him.

737
01:09:41,931 --> 01:09:43,481
Don't worry.

738
01:09:44,111 --> 01:09:45,744
We'll come to us.

739
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:50,495
KABLE, THE FALLEN HERO OF SLAYER
REST IN PEACE

740
01:10:58,161 --> 01:11:00,796
- Not bad for a video, huh?
- What?

741
01:11:00,797 --> 01:11:04,244
The latest and greatest, I defy you
to tell it from real life...

742
01:11:04,245 --> 01:11:06,012
could you imagine porn on this thing?

743
01:11:45,608 --> 01:11:51,491
<i>I've got you under my skin</i>

744
01:11:51,492 --> 01:11:57,493
<i>I've got you deep
in the heart of me.</i>

745
01:11:58,002 --> 01:12:00,340
<i>So deep in my heart</i>

746
01:12:00,341 --> 01:12:04,206
<i>that you're really a part of me</i>

747
01:12:05,186 --> 01:12:10,359
<i>I've got you under my skin</i>

748
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:15,093
<i>I'd tried so not to give in</i>

749
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:22,260
<i>I said to myself:
this affair never will go so well</i>

750
01:12:23,678 --> 01:12:29,042
<i>But why should I try to resist
when, baby, I know so well</i>

751
01:12:29,043 --> 01:12:35,045
<i>I've got you...</i>

752
01:12:36,266 --> 01:12:38,174
<i>under my skin.</i>

753
01:12:39,917 --> 01:12:42,925
<i>I'd sacrifice anything come what might</i>

754
01:12:42,926 --> 01:12:46,191
<i>For the sake of havin' you near.</i>

755
01:12:46,192 --> 01:12:49,941
<i>In spite of a warnin'
voice that comes in the night</i>

756
01:12:49,942 --> 01:12:53,126
<i>And repeats, repeats in my ear...</i>

757
01:12:53,127 --> 01:12:58,954
<i>Don't you know, little
fool, you never can win?</i>

758
01:12:58,955 --> 01:13:04,957
<i>Use your mentality,
wake up to reality.</i>

759
01:13:05,478 --> 01:13:10,644
<i>But each time that I do
just the thought of you</i>

760
01:13:10,645 --> 01:13:12,983
<i>Makes me stop before I begin</i>

761
01:13:12,984 --> 01:13:16,679
<i>'Cause I've got you under my skin</i>

762
01:13:19,888 --> 01:13:24,113
<i>under my skin.</i>

763
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:29,394
You're awesome!

764
01:13:29,395 --> 01:13:30,732
Castle.

765
01:13:30,733 --> 01:13:32,283
Kable.

766
01:13:33,504 --> 01:13:34,954
I don't care about you.

767
01:13:34,955 --> 01:13:37,255
You just want your little
sugar pie, I know.

768
01:13:37,256 --> 01:13:38,836
So don't do anything stupid.

769
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,134
My house, my rules.

770
01:13:41,903 --> 01:13:43,727
Come on, I want to show you something

771
01:13:50,001 --> 01:13:52,470
I wanted to thank you for
leading me into them,

772
01:13:52,471 --> 01:13:54,914
the Humanzuz's cell, that is.

773
01:13:56,292 --> 01:13:59,077
Of course sooner or later they
would be whistling my tune

774
01:13:59,077 --> 01:14:00,798
just like everybody else, but...

775
01:14:00,799 --> 01:14:04,035
Meantime, there's that little cracker
program they dreamed of that got my attention.

776
01:14:04,036 --> 01:14:06,084
That was a genuine disuse, no doubt about it

777
01:14:06,085 --> 01:14:08,295
One thing even they didn't know, though,

778
01:14:08,296 --> 01:14:10,312
I'm wired too.

779
01:14:10,313 --> 01:14:15,255
I replaced 98% of my own noodle
with nano-tissue years ago.

780
01:14:15,256 --> 01:14:18,641
But mine's different.
It's built to send,

781
01:14:20,938 --> 01:14:21,946
to transmit,

782
01:14:21,947 --> 01:14:24,328
whereas every other nano-cell
that I've put out there,

783
01:14:24,329 --> 01:14:27,170
including the ones
in your head Kable,

784
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:29,369
are designed to receive.

785
01:14:29,370 --> 01:14:31,916
I think it, you do it.

786
01:14:39,382 --> 01:14:42,201
We're talking every Slayer,
everyone in Society city.

787
01:14:42,202 --> 01:14:44,651
I believe your better half would
fall under that category,

788
01:14:44,651 --> 01:14:47,199
provided they were within
range of my transmitters.

789
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:50,566
Very nice, Castle. So you got
an army of psychotics

790
01:14:50,566 --> 01:14:52,869
and deviants to dance around for you?

791
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:58,119
You're thinking small, Kable.
But not as small as me.

792
01:14:58,119 --> 01:15:00,307
See, nano-cells are real small.

793
01:15:00,308 --> 01:15:03,743
A thousand times smaller than
these dust particulars.

794
01:15:04,678 --> 01:15:07,109
You inhale it. They go to work;
replicating, spreading

795
01:15:07,111 --> 01:15:10,022
like a virus, multiplying
in exponentials.

796
01:15:10,023 --> 01:15:13,359
Six months time, I can have a
hundred million people converted.

797
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,908
Ditch diggers, porn stars,
and presidents.

798
01:15:15,909 --> 01:15:17,274
Not one would be the wiser.

799
01:15:17,275 --> 01:15:20,187
A hundred million people who buy
what I want them to buy,

800
01:15:20,189 --> 01:15:22,273
vote how I want them to vote,

801
01:15:22,274 --> 01:15:25,861
do pretty much damn well anything
I figure they ought to do.

802
01:15:26,585 --> 01:15:28,136
For instance...

803
01:16:03,012 --> 01:16:05,335
You should have let him
fight for himself.

804
01:16:06,489 --> 01:16:08,117
Maybe you would've had a shot.

805
01:16:08,118 --> 01:16:11,216
- I think you're missing the point, my man.
- No no, I get it.

806
01:16:11,217 --> 01:16:12,652
You're pulling all the strings around here.

807
01:16:12,653 --> 01:16:15,201
Which makes my next move pretty...

808
01:16:17,290 --> 01:16:19,008
Neglected to mention my smart boys reversed

809
01:16:19,009 --> 01:16:21,255
that crack the Humanz worked for you.

810
01:16:21,256 --> 01:16:24,012
Easy breezy once I had access to their drives.

811
01:16:33,462 --> 01:16:37,027
<i>You're mine boy.</i>

812
01:16:53,846 --> 01:16:55,660
Come one, let's boogey wooguey
rock n' roll.

813
01:17:02,822 --> 01:17:05,706
I think that badass Slayer of the game
don't seem like much, does he?

814
01:17:13,433 --> 01:17:14,983
Lucky shot

815
01:17:17,298 --> 01:17:18,849
Not really.

816
01:17:30,473 --> 01:17:32,854
I need an audience
boys...

817
01:17:49,634 --> 01:17:55,185
No no no, you crawl...
on your belly like a toad.

818
01:17:55,187 --> 01:17:57,396
Is this bad?
I'm really bad.

819
01:17:58,015 --> 01:17:59,966
<i>Is this bad?
I'm really bad.</i>

820
01:18:06,687 --> 01:18:08,237
That's sweet.

821
01:18:10,903 --> 01:18:14,438
Alright boys are you ready?
It's time for a true test.

822
01:18:15,412 --> 01:18:18,179
Just like last time, remember?

823
01:18:20,847 --> 01:18:23,728
Yeah, you're stronger now,
a little more fighting...

824
01:18:23,729 --> 01:18:26,609
But I think the end result
will be just about the same.

825
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:46,793
What the hell was that?

826
01:18:46,794 --> 01:18:49,250
Someone from the outside
is sending him commands...

827
01:18:49,251 --> 01:18:51,227
We're being broadcast live.

828
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:54,684
Jam the signal!

829
01:18:55,695 --> 01:18:57,127
Goddamn retards!

830
01:18:57,128 --> 01:18:58,679
We're working on it...

831
01:19:00,314 --> 01:19:01,864
I think it,

832
01:19:02,415 --> 01:19:04,796
You... fucking... do it...

833
01:19:13,371 --> 01:19:15,379
Look at this knife...

834
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:17,363
imagine me sticking it into your gut.

835
01:19:18,875 --> 01:19:22,228
Think about it...
make it real!

836
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,549
Yes!

837
01:20:14,777 --> 01:20:18,601
- Are you okay?
- Are you my daddy, Tillman?

838
01:20:21,137 --> 01:20:22,688
I'm your daddy.

839
01:20:27,549 --> 01:20:29,100
Wait.

840
01:20:30,599 --> 01:20:32,658
- Shut it off.
- Pardon?

841
01:20:32,658 --> 01:20:34,641
The nanex.

842
01:20:35,612 --> 01:20:39,146
It's nothing to you.
Just a mouse click.

843
01:20:39,147 --> 01:20:40,698
Set us free.

844
01:20:46,489 --> 01:20:48,103
Well played, Kable.

845
