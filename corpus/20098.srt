1
00:01:56,612 --> 00:02:01,891
(computer voice) Stasis interrupted.
Fire in cryogenic compartment.

2
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:08,122
Repeat, fire in cryogenic compartment.
All personnelreport to...

3
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:12,490
..emergency escape vehicle launch pod.

4
00:02:14,452 --> 00:02:19,810
Deep-space Flight will commence
in Tminus 20 seconds.

5
00:03:36,852 --> 00:03:38,843
(alarm)

6
00:04:34,812 --> 00:04:37,929
Oh, Jesus Christ!

7
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:42,170
- What a way to make a landing!
- Get the torch!

8
00:04:54,132 --> 00:04:55,042
How many?

9
00:04:55,132 --> 00:04:59,523
- Don't know! Three, maybe four!
- Hey, Frank! Can we hurry this up!

10
00:04:59,612 --> 00:05:02,251
lt's gonna be 40 below in five minutes!

11
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:04,651
Whoa!

12
00:05:04,732 --> 00:05:06,290
- (dog barks)
- Come here!

13
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:07,851
- l'll kill him!
- What's that?

14
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:11,481
That stupid dog ofyours!
Get it out of here!

15
00:05:11,572 --> 00:05:14,245
- Come on, boy. Come on.
- (barking)

16
00:05:14,332 --> 00:05:16,243
- Get rid ofthat dog!
- He's gone!

17
00:05:20,092 --> 00:05:22,401
A bad way to go, huh?

18
00:05:23,372 --> 00:05:26,045
Hey, Frank, come on, let's go! Let's go!

19
00:05:26,132 --> 00:05:27,326
Wait!

20
00:05:29,572 --> 00:05:31,563
One ofthem is still alive!

21
00:05:44,372 --> 00:05:47,091
Right. We'll need all ofthose.

22
00:05:57,332 --> 00:06:01,689
That's it. OK. You're all right.

23
00:06:45,852 --> 00:06:47,843
(barking)

24
00:07:15,732 --> 00:07:19,042
This is Rumour Control.
Here are the facts.

25
00:07:19,132 --> 00:07:21,123
As some ofyou know,...

26
00:07:21,212 --> 00:07:25,410
..a 337 model EEV...

27
00:07:25,492 --> 00:07:31,044
..crash-landed here at 0600
on the morning watch.

28
00:07:31,132 --> 00:07:33,646
There was one survivor,...

29
00:07:33,732 --> 00:07:37,930
..two dead, and a droid that was
hopelessly smashed beyond repair.

30
00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:40,480
The survivor is a woman.

31
00:07:40,572 --> 00:07:42,802
- (laughter)
- ls she pretty?

32
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:46,771
l just want to say that
l've taken a vow of celibacy...

33
00:07:46,852 --> 00:07:48,888
..that also includes women.

34
00:07:48,972 --> 00:07:50,963
We've all taken the vow!

35
00:07:51,052 --> 00:07:52,610
Shut your gob, Morse!

36
00:07:52,692 --> 00:07:54,523
l don't appreciate company policy...

37
00:07:54,612 --> 00:07:58,287
..allowing her to intermingle
with the inmates and the staff!

38
00:07:58,372 --> 00:08:02,604
Our brother means to say
we view the presence of any outsider,...

39
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:04,922
..especially a woman,...

40
00:08:05,012 --> 00:08:09,210
..as a violation ofthe harmony,
and potential break in the spiritual unity.

41
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:11,567
We are aware ofyour feelings
in this matter.

42
00:08:11,652 --> 00:08:14,689
You will be pleased to know
that l have requested...

43
00:08:14,772 --> 00:08:18,890
..a rescue team.
Hopefully they will come this week...

44
00:08:18,972 --> 00:08:22,681
..and evacuate her ASAP.

45
00:08:22,772 --> 00:08:24,763
Don't give us that!

46
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:28,561
- What's her medical status?
- She doesn't seem too badly damaged.

47
00:08:28,652 --> 00:08:32,327
She's unconscious.
Can't give a more specific diagnosis.

48
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:34,687
- Will she live?
- l would think so.

49
00:08:36,252 --> 00:08:37,241
Look!

50
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:40,244
lt's in everybody's interest
she doesn't leave the infirmary...

51
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:44,564
..until the rescue team arrives.
Certainly not without an escort, right?

52
00:08:44,652 --> 00:08:46,210
Sir.

53
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:53,528
Gentlemen! We should all stick to our
set routine, and not get unduly agitated!

54
00:08:53,612 --> 00:08:55,045
Correct?

55
00:08:55,132 --> 00:08:57,043
All right.

56
00:08:57,132 --> 00:08:58,850
Thank you, gentlemen.

57
00:09:00,092 --> 00:09:01,445
(sighs)

58
00:09:03,652 --> 00:09:04,880
All right.

59
00:09:04,972 --> 00:09:06,883
Better get here soon.

60
00:09:44,052 --> 00:09:45,804
What's that?

61
00:09:47,012 --> 00:09:50,925
Just a little cocktail of my own mix.
A sort of eye-opener.

62
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:53,287
You a doctor?

63
00:09:53,372 --> 00:09:56,762
My name is Clemens.
l'm the Chief Medical Officer here.

64
00:09:56,852 --> 00:09:59,764
- Here?
- Fury 161.

65
00:09:59,852 --> 00:10:03,208
lt's one ofWeyland-Yutani's
backwater work prisons,...

66
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:05,965
..it grieves me to say. Do you mind?

67
00:10:09,372 --> 00:10:10,771
This is a stabiliser.

68
00:10:12,852 --> 00:10:17,801
l really ought to shave your head.
We have a big problem with lice here.

69
00:10:18,252 --> 00:10:22,165
When you feel better l'll give you
some clippers for your private parts.

70
00:10:22,252 --> 00:10:24,243
How did l get here?

71
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:28,084
You... crash-landed in an EEV.

72
00:10:28,172 --> 00:10:32,484
Evidently separated from your mother
ship before you hit our atmosphere.

73
00:10:32,572 --> 00:10:35,325
Any idea how long you've
been in hypersleep?

74
00:10:35,932 --> 00:10:37,843
Coming out that way can jolt your system.

75
00:10:37,932 --> 00:10:41,561
- l'll be sick for a couple ofweeks.
- lndeed.

76
00:10:43,612 --> 00:10:45,603
Where are the others?

77
00:10:45,692 --> 00:10:47,489
They didn't make it.

78
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:48,448
What?

79
00:10:48,532 --> 00:10:50,523
They didn't survive.

80
00:10:53,692 --> 00:10:56,252
l have to get to the ship.

81
00:10:56,452 --> 00:10:58,170
l have to get to the ship.

82
00:10:58,252 --> 00:11:01,528
- You're in no condition for that.
- You wanna get me some clothes, or...

83
00:11:01,612 --> 00:11:03,204
..should l go like this?

84
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:07,843
Given the nature of our indigenous
population, l would suggest clothes.

85
00:11:11,092 --> 00:11:13,890
None ofthem has seen a woman in years.

86
00:11:14,932 --> 00:11:17,207
Neither have l, for that matter.

87
00:11:19,452 --> 00:11:22,808
(Clemens)
This used to be a 5,000-convict facility.

88
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:26,726
But it's been reduced
to a custodial... staff of 25.

89
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:29,201
- Why?
- To keep the pilot light on.

90
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:30,691
Pilot light for what?

91
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:33,448
Blast furnace!

92
00:11:33,772 --> 00:11:37,731
Natural methane!
We have a foundry, Lt. Ripley!

93
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,803
The inmates forge lead sheets
for toxic waste containment!

94
00:11:41,892 --> 00:11:43,883
How do you know my name?

95
00:11:44,692 --> 00:11:47,286
lt's stencilled on the back ofyour shorts.

96
00:11:55,052 --> 00:11:57,008
(prisoner) Release the cable!

97
00:12:13,452 --> 00:12:15,886
Where are the bodies?

98
00:12:15,972 --> 00:12:19,885
We have a morgue. We've put them there
until the investigative team arrives.

99
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,440
ln about a week, l think.

100
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:27,127
- There was a droid.
- Disconnected.

101
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:31,683
He was in bits and pieces. We put
what was left on the rubbish tip.

102
00:12:31,772 --> 00:12:33,524
The corporal was impaled...

103
00:12:33,612 --> 00:12:35,045
..by that safety support.

104
00:12:35,132 --> 00:12:36,963
Never knew what hit him.

105
00:12:37,052 --> 00:12:39,361
And the girl?

106
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:42,569
She... drowned in her cryo-tube.

107
00:12:42,652 --> 00:12:45,564
l don't think she was conscious...

108
00:12:45,652 --> 00:12:48,644
..when it happened. l'm sorry.

109
00:13:08,492 --> 00:13:10,608
- (gasps)
- What's the matter?

110
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:14,048
- Where is she?
- ln the morgue.

111
00:13:14,132 --> 00:13:16,521
l have to see her.

112
00:13:16,612 --> 00:13:19,285
l have to see what's left of her.

113
00:13:24,932 --> 00:13:27,685
Oh, God, there you are!

114
00:13:27,772 --> 00:13:31,731
l've been looking everywhere for you!
Where you been, huh?

115
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,007
(dog pants)

116
00:13:41,172 --> 00:13:43,083
Come here!

117
00:13:43,932 --> 00:13:45,490
You OK?

118
00:13:45,572 --> 00:13:48,132
Let me see, Spike. Let me see.
Are you OK?

119
00:13:48,212 --> 00:13:50,328
Let me see.

120
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:54,205
What have you been
sticking your face into?

121
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,247
Hey!

122
00:13:55,332 --> 00:13:57,892
- (whimpers)
- Did somebody do this to you?

123
00:14:03,692 --> 00:14:06,684
What kind of animal
would do this to a dog?

124
00:14:31,932 --> 00:14:33,524
Um,...

125
00:14:34,212 --> 00:14:36,601
..could l have a moment alone, please?

126
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:39,449
Yes, of course.

127
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:12,283
(whispers) Forgive me.

128
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:37,809
What's she doing?

129
00:15:49,412 --> 00:15:50,447
OK?

130
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:52,931
No.

131
00:15:55,052 --> 00:15:57,008
We have to do an autopsy.

132
00:15:57,092 --> 00:15:58,730
- What?
- l told you.

133
00:15:58,812 --> 00:16:00,962
We have to make sure how she died.

134
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:05,522
And l told you... she drowned.

135
00:16:06,452 --> 00:16:08,488
l'm not so sure. l...

136
00:16:08,572 --> 00:16:10,847
l have to see inside of her.

137
00:16:10,932 --> 00:16:13,127
You're disorientated.

138
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:15,282
l have a very, verygood reason.

139
00:16:15,372 --> 00:16:17,408
Perhaps you'd like
to share that reason?

140
00:16:20,452 --> 00:16:23,205
Possible contagion.

141
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:25,886
What kind, exactly?

142
00:16:26,132 --> 00:16:28,123
- Cholera.
- Cholera?

143
00:16:30,652 --> 00:16:34,440
There hasn't been a case of cholera
reported for 200 years.

144
00:16:40,772 --> 00:16:42,763
(whispers) Please?

145
00:17:17,532 --> 00:17:19,443
Everything's in place.

146
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:21,563
There's no sign of infection.

147
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:25,284
No indication of disease.

148
00:17:25,372 --> 00:17:28,523
Her chest. Open her chest.

149
00:17:36,532 --> 00:17:37,647
Careful.

150
00:18:08,692 --> 00:18:09,966
Lungs...

151
00:18:12,412 --> 00:18:14,721
..flooded with fluid.

152
00:18:17,092 --> 00:18:19,526
Ergo, she drowned.

153
00:18:24,572 --> 00:18:26,130
Now,...

154
00:18:26,212 --> 00:18:28,521
..since l'm not a complete idiot,...

155
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:31,445
..would you tell me
what we're really looking for?

156
00:18:31,532 --> 00:18:33,363
(door opens)

157
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:44,002
Mr Clemens!

158
00:18:44,212 --> 00:18:45,042
Superintendent!

159
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:50,968
l don't believe you've met
Lieutenant Ripley.

160
00:18:51,052 --> 00:18:55,091
- What's going on, Mr Clemens?
- That's right, sir. What's going on?

161
00:18:56,532 --> 00:18:58,250
First,...

162
00:18:58,332 --> 00:19:03,042
..the lieutenant is feeling much better,
l'm happy to say.

163
00:19:03,132 --> 00:19:05,521
Second,
in the interest of public health,...

164
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,126
- ..l am performing an autopsy.
- Without my authority.

165
00:19:08,212 --> 00:19:12,490
There didn't seem to be time.
But it's turned out all right.

166
00:19:12,572 --> 00:19:14,881
- There's no sign of contagion.
- Good.

167
00:19:14,972 --> 00:19:18,567
lt might help if Ripley didn't parade
around in front ofthe prisoners.

168
00:19:18,652 --> 00:19:22,611
As l am told she did in the last hour.
lt might also be helpful...

169
00:19:22,692 --> 00:19:25,570
..if you informed me of any
change in her physical status.

170
00:19:25,652 --> 00:19:29,167
- Or is that asking too much?
- We have to cremate the bodies.

171
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,925
Nonsense! We'll keep the bodies on ice...

172
00:19:32,012 --> 00:19:34,890
- ..till the rescue team arrives.
- On ice.

173
00:19:34,972 --> 00:19:37,532
There is the public-health issue.

174
00:19:37,612 --> 00:19:42,402
The lieutenant feels there is still the
possibility of a communicable infection...

175
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:46,440
l thought you said
there was no sign of disease?

176
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:48,682
lt would appearthe child drowned.

177
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:53,050
But without proper laboratory tests
it's impossible to be certain.

178
00:19:53,132 --> 00:19:57,842
l would consider it unwise to tolerate even
the possibility of an unwelcome virus.

179
00:19:57,932 --> 00:20:01,288
An outbreak of... cholera...

180
00:20:01,372 --> 00:20:05,001
..would look extremely bad on a report,
would it not, sir?

181
00:20:06,932 --> 00:20:09,571
We've 25 prisoners in this facility,...

182
00:20:09,652 --> 00:20:11,608
..all double Y chromos,...

183
00:20:11,692 --> 00:20:15,844
..all thieves, rapists, murderers,
child molesters. All scum.

184
00:20:15,932 --> 00:20:20,483
Just because they've taken on religion
doesn't make them any less dangerous.

185
00:20:20,572 --> 00:20:22,881
l try not to offend their convictions.

186
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,406
l don't want to upset the order.

187
00:20:26,412 --> 00:20:28,801
l don't want ripples in the water.

188
00:20:28,892 --> 00:20:32,726
And l don't want a woman
walking around, giving them ideas.

189
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,970
l see.

190
00:20:35,052 --> 00:20:37,646
For my own personal safety.

191
00:20:38,332 --> 00:20:39,685
Exactly.

192
00:20:40,412 --> 00:20:44,485
l will leave the details ofthe cremation
to you, Mr Clemens.

193
00:20:47,172 --> 00:20:52,326
They may use the furnace, but l want
everyone back in lockup by 2200 hours.

194
00:21:53,532 --> 00:21:59,528
We commit this child and this man
to Your keeping, O Lord.

195
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:06,648
Their bodies have been taken
from the shadow of our nights.

196
00:22:09,292 --> 00:22:13,080
They have been released...

197
00:22:13,172 --> 00:22:17,006
..from all darkness and pain.

198
00:22:17,412 --> 00:22:18,606
(growls)

199
00:22:21,572 --> 00:22:24,723
The child and the man...

200
00:22:25,452 --> 00:22:27,568
..have gone beyond our world.

201
00:22:29,252 --> 00:22:31,368
They are forever...

202
00:22:31,452 --> 00:22:32,885
..eternal...

203
00:22:32,972 --> 00:22:35,122
..and everlasting.

204
00:22:35,252 --> 00:22:37,243
(dog barks)

205
00:22:39,252 --> 00:22:41,243
Ashes to ashes,...

206
00:22:41,732 --> 00:22:43,927
..dust to dust.

207
00:22:46,412 --> 00:22:49,085
(Dillon) Why?

208
00:22:49,172 --> 00:22:51,732
Why are the innocent punished?

209
00:22:51,812 --> 00:22:53,245
(dog growls)

210
00:22:55,052 --> 00:22:56,531
(dog whines)

211
00:22:56,612 --> 00:22:59,285
Why the sacrifice?

212
00:23:02,052 --> 00:23:03,690
Why the pain?

213
00:23:03,772 --> 00:23:05,330
(growls)

214
00:23:05,412 --> 00:23:06,322
(whines)

215
00:23:06,412 --> 00:23:09,051
There aren't any promises.

216
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:12,283
Nothing's certain.

217
00:23:13,252 --> 00:23:18,167
Only that some get called,
some get saved.

218
00:23:18,252 --> 00:23:22,848
She won't ever know
the hardship and grief...

219
00:23:22,932 --> 00:23:24,570
..for those of us left behind.

220
00:23:25,532 --> 00:23:28,251
We commit these bodies to the void...

221
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:30,529
..with a glad heart.

222
00:23:38,332 --> 00:23:39,321
(growls)

223
00:23:41,732 --> 00:23:43,882
For within each seed...

224
00:23:43,972 --> 00:23:46,281
..there is a promise of a flower.

225
00:23:50,052 --> 00:23:52,122
And within each death,...

226
00:23:52,212 --> 00:23:56,285
..no matter how small,...

227
00:23:56,372 --> 00:23:58,488
..there's always a new life.

228
00:24:01,212 --> 00:24:04,966
A new... beginning.

229
00:24:09,052 --> 00:24:10,451
Amen.

230
00:24:13,092 --> 00:24:14,445
(all) Amen.

231
00:24:44,252 --> 00:24:46,846
l tellya, it's fuckin' weird.

232
00:24:46,932 --> 00:24:51,448
The only one thatsurvived that crash
is a woman.

233
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:54,524
They'd already changed everything.

234
00:24:56,932 --> 00:24:59,890
l knowshe's serious...

235
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:04,846
What the fuck are we supposed to do?

236
00:25:09,052 --> 00:25:10,610
l mean it!

237
00:25:17,412 --> 00:25:21,007
Not from round here, that's for sure.

238
00:25:23,612 --> 00:25:25,842
Hello...

239
00:26:09,332 --> 00:26:13,325
l just wanted to, uh, say thanks
for what you said at the funeral.

240
00:26:13,412 --> 00:26:15,084
lt was...

241
00:26:16,172 --> 00:26:17,969
My friends would've appreciated...

242
00:26:18,052 --> 00:26:20,725
Yeah, well,
you don't wanna know me, lady.

243
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:23,372
l'm a murderer and rapist ofwomen.

244
00:26:26,092 --> 00:26:27,320
Really?

245
00:26:30,852 --> 00:26:34,049
Well, l guess...
l must make you nervous.

246
00:26:48,772 --> 00:26:50,763
Do you have any faith, sister?

247
00:26:50,852 --> 00:26:52,331
Not much.

248
00:26:52,412 --> 00:26:54,687
Well, we've got a lot offaith here.

249
00:26:55,932 --> 00:26:59,686
- Enough even for you.
- l thought women weren't allowed.

250
00:26:59,772 --> 00:27:01,649
We've never had any before.

251
00:27:02,812 --> 00:27:05,246
But we tolerate anybody.

252
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,323
Even the intolerable.

253
00:27:09,012 --> 00:27:10,286
Thank you.

254
00:27:10,372 --> 00:27:14,843
That's just a statement of principle.
Nothing personal. You see,...

255
00:27:14,932 --> 00:27:17,890
..we've got a good place to wait here.

256
00:27:17,972 --> 00:27:19,963
And until now...

257
00:27:20,052 --> 00:27:21,724
..no temptation.

258
00:27:23,052 --> 00:27:25,088
(Clemens)
Dillon and the rest ofthe...

259
00:27:25,172 --> 00:27:28,323
..alternative people...

260
00:27:28,412 --> 00:27:32,963
..embraced religion,
as it were, about five years ago.

261
00:27:33,052 --> 00:27:35,725
- Take two?
- (Ripley) l'm on medication.

262
00:27:35,812 --> 00:27:38,201
- Hardly.
- What kind of religion?

263
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:43,650
Some sort of... apocalyptic,
millenarian, Christian fundamentalist...

264
00:27:43,732 --> 00:27:45,882
- Right.
- Exactly.

265
00:27:45,972 --> 00:27:48,770
When the company
wanted to close the facility down,...

266
00:27:48,852 --> 00:27:52,242
..Dillon and the rest ofthe converts
wanted to stay.

267
00:27:52,332 --> 00:27:56,291
And... they were allowed
to remain as custodians,...

268
00:27:56,372 --> 00:27:58,442
..with two minders...

269
00:27:58,892 --> 00:28:00,883
..and a medical officer.

270
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,769
And here we are.

271
00:28:04,212 --> 00:28:06,407
How did you get
this wonderful assignment?

272
00:28:09,452 --> 00:28:11,443
How do you like your new haircut?

273
00:28:13,052 --> 00:28:14,565
lt's OK.

274
00:28:30,132 --> 00:28:33,568
Now that l've gone out
on a limb for you with Andrews,...

275
00:28:33,652 --> 00:28:38,282
..damaged my already less-than-perfect
relationship with that good man,...

276
00:28:38,372 --> 00:28:43,048
..and briefed you on the humdrum
history of Fury 161,...

277
00:28:43,132 --> 00:28:46,761
..can you not tell me what
you were looking for in the girl?

278
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:48,888
Are you attracted to me?

279
00:28:49,852 --> 00:28:51,888
ln what way?

280
00:28:54,092 --> 00:28:55,844
ln thatway.

281
00:28:58,052 --> 00:29:00,008
You're very direct.

282
00:29:01,332 --> 00:29:03,971
l've been out here a long time.

283
00:29:07,572 --> 00:29:11,645
 ln the year 7510

284
00:29:12,852 --> 00:29:15,844
(prisoner continues singing)

285
00:29:24,412 --> 00:29:26,164
(singing stops)

286
00:29:48,772 --> 00:29:49,887
Eurgh!

287
00:29:59,492 --> 00:30:02,086
(whispers) Hey, Spike! Spike!

288
00:30:02,172 --> 00:30:03,764
Spikey!

289
00:30:08,612 --> 00:30:11,809
Are you down there?
What are you doing?

290
00:30:18,052 --> 00:30:19,007
Aargh!

291
00:30:19,332 --> 00:30:21,482
Aargh!

292
00:30:54,012 --> 00:30:56,606
l really appreciate your affections.

293
00:30:58,212 --> 00:31:01,488
But l am aware that they...
deflected my question.

294
00:31:03,372 --> 00:31:05,203
ln the nicest possible way.

295
00:31:09,812 --> 00:31:12,042
(Ripley) You're spoiling the mood.

296
00:31:13,132 --> 00:31:18,001
l have ajob to do. l just want
to know why we had to cremate them.

297
00:31:18,092 --> 00:31:20,652
l had a terrible dream in hypersleep.

298
00:31:22,092 --> 00:31:24,890
And l had to be sure what killed her.

299
00:31:24,972 --> 00:31:27,167
Anyway, l made a mistake.

300
00:31:28,892 --> 00:31:29,881
Possibly.

301
00:31:31,452 --> 00:31:33,841
And now l've made another mistake.

302
00:31:33,932 --> 00:31:38,244
- Really? What's that?
- Fraternising with a prisoner.

303
00:31:39,412 --> 00:31:42,484
Physical contact.
lt's against the rules, isn't it?

304
00:31:45,412 --> 00:31:47,562
l'm not a prisoner.

305
00:31:49,852 --> 00:31:53,447
You have a bar code
on the back ofyour head.

306
00:31:56,852 --> 00:31:59,127
That does deserve an explanation.

307
00:32:00,412 --> 00:32:02,642
But l don't think now is the moment.

308
00:32:09,412 --> 00:32:11,403
(intercom) Mr Clemens.

309
00:32:12,252 --> 00:32:13,526
Mr Aaron.

310
00:32:13,612 --> 00:32:17,890
Superintendent Andrews wouldlike you
to report to ventshaft22. Now.

311
00:32:17,972 --> 00:32:20,930
- We've hadan accident.
- Something serious?

312
00:32:21,012 --> 00:32:25,722
You could callit that.
One ofourprisoners has been... diced.

313
00:32:26,212 --> 00:32:28,806
Sorry. l have to go.

314
00:32:32,052 --> 00:32:34,088
Official duties.

315
00:33:01,092 --> 00:33:03,447
- Who was it?
- Murphy.

316
00:33:03,532 --> 00:33:05,568
How do you know?

317
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:07,563
That's his boot.

318
00:33:10,532 --> 00:33:13,330
l gave him the assignment, sir.
He was a wanker.

319
00:33:13,412 --> 00:33:15,721
No apologies, Mr Aaron,
it wasn't your fault.

320
00:33:27,292 --> 00:33:31,046
Well, not much to say, is there?
Death was instantaneous.

321
00:33:31,132 --> 00:33:32,121
No shit.

322
00:33:32,212 --> 00:33:34,487
l take it he was pulled into the fan.

323
00:33:34,572 --> 00:33:36,449
Rush of air, l'd imagine. Except...

324
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,523
Right! Almost happened to me once.

325
00:33:38,612 --> 00:33:44,721
l've told 'em so many times: stay away
from the fans. Nobody bloody listens.

326
00:33:44,812 --> 00:33:46,530
Except the fan was blowing.

327
00:33:54,492 --> 00:33:55,288
What's that?

328
00:33:55,372 --> 00:33:57,806
- l don't know.
- l want to see you in my quarters...

329
00:33:57,892 --> 00:34:01,168
..in 30 minutes, ifyou please,
Mr Clemens.

330
00:34:07,252 --> 00:34:09,208
Have you got any ideas?

331
00:34:44,012 --> 00:34:46,287
(beeping)

332
00:34:52,252 --> 00:34:55,847
You know,
wandering around without an escort...

333
00:34:55,932 --> 00:34:59,447
..will really piss
Superintendent Andrews off.

334
00:34:59,532 --> 00:35:03,810
- Tell me about your accident.
- One ofthe prisoners has been killed.

335
00:35:05,412 --> 00:35:07,846
Really? How?

336
00:35:07,932 --> 00:35:10,082
ln the air shaft.

337
00:35:10,172 --> 00:35:12,811
Poor sod backed into a 9-foot fan.

338
00:35:12,892 --> 00:35:16,123
l found something
at the accident site.

339
00:35:16,212 --> 00:35:19,284
Just... a bit away
from where it happened.

340
00:35:19,372 --> 00:35:21,090
A mark.

341
00:35:21,172 --> 00:35:23,128
A burn.

342
00:35:24,532 --> 00:35:27,330
Like the one you found
on the girl's cryo-tube.

343
00:35:33,252 --> 00:35:34,810
Look,...

344
00:35:34,892 --> 00:35:37,042
..l'm on yourside.

345
00:35:37,132 --> 00:35:40,408
l want to help,
but l need to know what's going on.

346
00:35:40,492 --> 00:35:42,881
Or what you think is going on.

347
00:35:45,372 --> 00:35:49,251
lf you really wanna help, find me
a computer with audio capabilities...

348
00:35:49,332 --> 00:35:51,323
..to access this flight recorder.

349
00:35:51,412 --> 00:35:53,642
We don't have anything like that here.

350
00:35:53,732 --> 00:35:55,450
What about Bishop?

351
00:35:55,532 --> 00:35:58,285
- Bishop?
- The droid that crashed with me.

352
00:35:58,372 --> 00:36:00,761
l can point you in the right direction.

353
00:36:00,852 --> 00:36:04,845
l can'tjoin you.
l have a previous engagement.

354
00:36:07,812 --> 00:36:09,689
Listen to me, you piece of shit!

355
00:36:09,772 --> 00:36:12,570
Screw with me once more,
l'll cut you in half.

356
00:36:13,532 --> 00:36:15,682
l'm sorry, l don't think l understand.

357
00:36:15,772 --> 00:36:18,525
At 0700 hours
l received word from the network.

358
00:36:18,612 --> 00:36:21,046
This is the first high-level
communication...

359
00:36:21,132 --> 00:36:24,807
..this installation has ever received,
to my knowledge.

360
00:36:25,172 --> 00:36:27,447
They want this woman looked after.

361
00:36:27,532 --> 00:36:30,126
- They consider her to be high priority.
- Why?

362
00:36:30,212 --> 00:36:32,203
l have no idea.

363
00:36:32,692 --> 00:36:35,490
Why did you let her
out ofthe infirmary?!

364
00:36:35,572 --> 00:36:38,086
This accident with Murphy
is what happens...

365
00:36:38,172 --> 00:36:40,766
..when one ofthese sons of bitches
gets a hard-on.

366
00:36:40,852 --> 00:36:42,444
l'm a doctor, you're the jailer.

367
00:36:44,932 --> 00:36:47,048
We both know exactly what you are.

368
00:36:48,492 --> 00:36:49,641
Sit down!

369
00:36:49,732 --> 00:36:55,364
l think it might be better if l left.
l find you unpleasant to be around.

370
00:36:55,452 --> 00:36:56,567
lsn't that lovely!

371
00:36:56,652 --> 00:36:58,643
Consider this, Mr Clemens.

372
00:36:58,732 --> 00:37:03,852
How would you like me to explain
your sordid history to your new friend?

373
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:06,651
For her personal edification, of course.

374
00:37:07,612 --> 00:37:10,126
Now sit the hell down.

375
00:37:20,812 --> 00:37:21,847
Now,...

376
00:37:21,932 --> 00:37:24,241
..is there anything l should know?

377
00:37:29,412 --> 00:37:31,004
(thunder)

378
00:38:58,052 --> 00:39:00,441
- Ohhh!
- Shut up, you fuckin' bitch!

379
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:02,771
Shut up, you bitch!

380
00:39:04,612 --> 00:39:06,842
Let go of me!

381
00:39:06,932 --> 00:39:08,650
Fuck you!

382
00:39:08,732 --> 00:39:09,448
No!

383
00:39:09,532 --> 00:39:12,410
- Hold still!
- Ssh! Ssh!

384
00:39:12,492 --> 00:39:13,402
No!

385
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:17,483
Aaaaghhhh!

386
00:39:21,732 --> 00:39:22,926
You OK?

387
00:39:25,692 --> 00:39:27,728
Son of a bitch!

388
00:39:32,772 --> 00:39:35,889
Take off. l gotta re-educate
some ofthe brothers.

389
00:39:35,972 --> 00:39:39,965
We gotta discuss
some matters ofthe spirit.

390
00:39:51,132 --> 00:39:54,010
This is like ten city blocks.

391
00:39:56,532 --> 00:39:58,170
How many?

392
00:39:58,252 --> 00:40:01,244
- This makes 176.
- (Golic chews noisily)

393
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:05,962
Can't you chew quieter? l'm trying
to figure out how big this compartment is.

394
00:40:06,052 --> 00:40:10,682
- l can't think with this goddamn noise...
- You're not supposed to swear.

395
00:40:10,772 --> 00:40:12,524
l'm sorry.

396
00:40:12,612 --> 00:40:15,285
We've encircled this entire compartment...

397
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:16,851
Hey!

398
00:40:16,932 --> 00:40:18,285
What?

399
00:40:23,092 --> 00:40:25,765
- What the shit is doing that?
- Swearing!

400
00:40:25,852 --> 00:40:28,685
Shut up! lt's all right to say "shit".
lt ain't against God.

401
00:40:28,772 --> 00:40:30,569
What's going on with the candles?

402
00:40:35,812 --> 00:40:38,121
Must be the wind
from one ofthe vent shafts.

403
00:40:38,212 --> 00:40:40,567
Backwash from
the closest circulating unit.

404
00:40:40,652 --> 00:40:44,281
But if all the candles go out,
how are we gonna know where we are?

405
00:40:44,372 --> 00:40:47,569
Somebody will just have
to go back and relight them.

406
00:40:48,052 --> 00:40:50,282
l guess l'm nominated.

407
00:41:00,452 --> 00:41:02,124
Watch your step, brother.

408
00:41:11,372 --> 00:41:14,489
OK, who are the comedians?

409
00:41:46,972 --> 00:41:48,769
(screeching)

410
00:41:50,812 --> 00:41:52,245
Agh! Agh! No!

411
00:41:52,332 --> 00:41:54,163
Argh!

412
00:41:55,732 --> 00:41:56,801
Go!

413
00:41:56,892 --> 00:41:58,803
Aargh!

414
00:41:59,532 --> 00:42:01,363
Quick, in here!

415
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:02,680
Help me, help me!

416
00:42:04,372 --> 00:42:07,125
Go! Fuckin' go!

417
00:42:09,132 --> 00:42:11,805
Go on! Go on! Quick!

418
00:42:13,852 --> 00:42:14,967
(screaming)

419
00:42:15,052 --> 00:42:16,246
Come on!

420
00:42:21,052 --> 00:42:22,201
Give me that!

421
00:42:58,252 --> 00:42:59,685
(pipe clanks)

422
00:43:01,492 --> 00:43:02,163
Agh!

423
00:43:02,252 --> 00:43:04,561
Get this fuckin' thing off me!

424
00:43:04,652 --> 00:43:06,005
Oh, God, no!

425
00:43:06,092 --> 00:43:07,969
Let me go!

426
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:08,802
Agh!

427
00:43:08,892 --> 00:43:10,211
(screams)

428
00:43:21,492 --> 00:43:22,561
(beeping)

429
00:43:34,972 --> 00:43:36,041
(beep)

430
00:44:03,612 --> 00:44:04,601
(whispers) Hey!

431
00:44:06,732 --> 00:44:10,122
- (whispers) Hello, Ripley.
- (whispers) Hello, Bishop.

432
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:14,008
- How are you feeling?
- My legs hurt.

433
00:44:15,532 --> 00:44:19,366
- Listen, l'm sorry.
- That's OK. l'm just a glorified toaster.

434
00:44:19,972 --> 00:44:21,690
How are you?

435
00:44:22,492 --> 00:44:24,801
l like your new haircut.

436
00:44:24,892 --> 00:44:27,042
Can you access data
on the flight recorder?

437
00:44:27,132 --> 00:44:28,326
No problem.

438
00:44:33,492 --> 00:44:34,561
l'm home.

439
00:44:34,652 --> 00:44:36,643
What happened on the Sulaco?

440
00:44:37,052 --> 00:44:39,202
Why were our cryo-tubes ejected?

441
00:44:39,292 --> 00:44:41,726
(female computer voice)
Stasis interrupted.

442
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:47,011
Fire in cryogenic compartment.
Repeat, fire in cryogenic...

443
00:44:47,092 --> 00:44:50,164
What happened?
What started the fire, Bishop?

444
00:44:50,492 --> 00:44:52,483
Can you hear me?

445
00:44:54,652 --> 00:44:59,851
The fire was electrical.
lt was... in the subflooring.

446
00:44:59,932 --> 00:45:03,368
Did the sensors pick up anything
moving around prior to separation?

447
00:45:03,452 --> 00:45:06,489
lt's very dark here, Ripley.
l'm not what l used to be.

448
00:45:06,572 --> 00:45:07,721
Just tell me.

449
00:45:07,812 --> 00:45:10,804
Does the recorder indicate anything?

450
00:45:10,892 --> 00:45:13,452
Was there an alien on board?

451
00:45:14,932 --> 00:45:16,650
Yes.

452
00:45:19,692 --> 00:45:23,810
ls it on the Sulaco,
or did it come with us in the EEV?

453
00:45:23,892 --> 00:45:27,089
lt was with us all the way.

454
00:45:30,692 --> 00:45:32,603
Does the company know?

455
00:45:32,692 --> 00:45:35,889
The company knows everything
that happened on the ship.

456
00:45:35,972 --> 00:45:40,363
lt all goes into the computer
and gets sent back to network.

457
00:45:40,452 --> 00:45:42,249
And they want it?

458
00:45:42,332 --> 00:45:44,209
l hurt.

459
00:45:44,292 --> 00:45:47,443
Do me a favour. Disconnect me.

460
00:45:47,532 --> 00:45:51,445
l could be reworked.
But l'll never be top-of-the-line again.

461
00:45:52,412 --> 00:45:54,084
l'd rather be nothing.

462
00:45:55,532 --> 00:45:56,521
You sure?

463
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:01,642
- Do it for me, Ripley.
- (Ripleysighs)

464
00:46:07,572 --> 00:46:10,689
(metallic sigh)

465
00:46:11,772 --> 00:46:14,081
(agitated voices)

466
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:15,771
lt wasn't me!

467
00:46:15,852 --> 00:46:18,002
l didn't do it!

468
00:46:18,092 --> 00:46:22,051
So help me! lt was the dragon.

469
00:46:22,132 --> 00:46:25,204
Feeds on minds.
lt was... Nobody can stop it.

470
00:46:25,292 --> 00:46:30,002
- What about Boggs and Rains?
- Slaughtered like pigs. lt wasn't me!

471
00:46:30,092 --> 00:46:31,571
lt wasn't me!

472
00:46:31,652 --> 00:46:36,203
Stark raving mad. lt wasn't anyone's fault,
but he should have been chained up.

473
00:46:36,292 --> 00:46:39,364
You called it, sir. Mad as a fuckin' hatter.

474
00:46:39,452 --> 00:46:43,161
Keep him separated. Don't want him
causing a panic. Clemens!

475
00:46:43,252 --> 00:46:45,322
- Yeah.
- Sedate this poor idiot.

476
00:46:45,412 --> 00:46:47,721
Not until we know about the brothers.

477
00:46:47,812 --> 00:46:51,521
Now, pull yourselftogether.
Talk to me now.

478
00:46:51,612 --> 00:46:54,206
- Now, where are Boggs and Rains?
- lt wasn't me.

479
00:46:54,292 --> 00:46:56,852
(Andrews) You won't get
anything out of him!

480
00:46:56,932 --> 00:46:59,048
We'll have to send out a search team.

481
00:46:59,132 --> 00:47:02,727
There's a good chance
this simple bastard has murdered them!

482
00:47:05,372 --> 00:47:07,602
And you don't know that.

483
00:47:08,772 --> 00:47:10,763
He's never lied to me.

484
00:47:10,852 --> 00:47:12,365
He's crazy,...

485
00:47:12,452 --> 00:47:14,602
..he's a fool, but he's not a liar!

486
00:47:16,412 --> 00:47:18,767
He's telling the truth.

487
00:47:18,852 --> 00:47:21,889
l'd like to talk to him
about this... this dragon.

488
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,485
lt's a dragon!

489
00:47:23,572 --> 00:47:26,689
You won't talk to anyone.
l'm not interested in your opinion.

490
00:47:26,772 --> 00:47:29,605
You are not in full possession ofthe facts.

491
00:47:29,692 --> 00:47:33,241
He is a convicted murderer,
known for particularly brutal crimes.

492
00:47:33,332 --> 00:47:36,881
- lsn't that right, Mr Dillon?
- Yeah.

493
00:47:36,972 --> 00:47:38,690
That part's right.

494
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:43,769
Then l'll talk to you. lt's important.

495
00:47:43,852 --> 00:47:48,846
When l've finished with my official duties,
l'll be pleased to have a little chat. Yes?

496
00:47:53,252 --> 00:47:55,561
Let me see if l have this correct,
Lieutenant.

497
00:47:56,372 --> 00:47:59,364
lt's an eight-foot creature,
with acid for blood,...

498
00:47:59,452 --> 00:48:01,443
..and it arrived on your spaceship.

499
00:48:02,172 --> 00:48:05,801
lt kills on sight and is...
generally unpleasant.

500
00:48:05,892 --> 00:48:08,326
And you expect me
to accept all this on yourword.

501
00:48:08,412 --> 00:48:10,687
No. l don't expect anything.

502
00:48:10,772 --> 00:48:12,091
Quite a story, Mr Aaron.

503
00:48:12,172 --> 00:48:16,370
Right, sir. lt's a beauty.
Never heard anything quite like it, sir.

504
00:48:16,452 --> 00:48:20,411
Expect not. Tell me, Lieutenant,
what would you suggest we do?

505
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:25,000
Well, what kind ofweapons have you got?

506
00:48:25,092 --> 00:48:29,449
This is a prison. lt's not a good idea
to allow prisoners access to firearms.

507
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:31,250
lt keeps them from killing you.

508
00:48:31,332 --> 00:48:35,120
There's no way to escape.
With the arrival ofthe next supply ship,...

509
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:38,010
..the company will eliminate it.

510
00:48:38,092 --> 00:48:42,927
This is a maximum security prison...

511
00:48:43,012 --> 00:48:46,846
..and you have no weapons of any kind?

512
00:48:48,652 --> 00:48:51,405
We have some carving knives
in the abattoir,...

513
00:48:51,492 --> 00:48:53,960
..a few more in the mess hall,
some fire axes.

514
00:48:54,052 --> 00:48:56,043
Nothing terribly formidable.

515
00:48:56,132 --> 00:48:57,406
That's all?

516
00:48:57,492 --> 00:49:00,290
We're on the honour system.

517
00:49:04,292 --> 00:49:05,884
Then we're fucked.

518
00:49:05,972 --> 00:49:08,930
No! You're fucked.

519
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:12,243
Confined to the infirmary. Quarantined.

520
00:49:12,332 --> 00:49:13,606
Mr Aaron will escort you.

521
00:49:13,692 --> 00:49:18,846
You'll be safe from any large, nasty beasts
while you're there. Right?

522
00:49:20,292 --> 00:49:21,930
Yes.

523
00:49:22,012 --> 00:49:24,128
That's a good girl.

524
00:49:24,532 --> 00:49:25,442
(intercom)

525
00:49:25,532 --> 00:49:29,241
Let's allreport to the mess hall.
The superintendent wants a meeting.

526
00:49:29,332 --> 00:49:31,243
Mess hall, rightaway, people.

527
00:49:31,332 --> 00:49:34,802
lsn't there any way off ofthis place?
Some way to escape?

528
00:49:34,892 --> 00:49:36,689
(laughs) No.

529
00:49:36,772 --> 00:49:40,048
- A supply ship comes every six months.
- That's it?

530
00:49:40,132 --> 00:49:41,201
That's it.

531
00:49:41,292 --> 00:49:42,884
(whispers) Fuck!

532
00:49:43,732 --> 00:49:47,930
They are sending somebody
to pick you up quite soon.

533
00:49:48,012 --> 00:49:50,924
Really? (coughs) What's soon?

534
00:49:51,012 --> 00:49:55,528
l don't know. Nobody's ever
been in a hurry to get here before.

535
00:49:57,852 --> 00:50:00,889
Do you want to tell me
what you and Andrews talked about?

536
00:50:00,972 --> 00:50:02,121
No.

537
00:50:03,212 --> 00:50:05,203
You'd just say l'm crazy.

538
00:50:07,132 --> 00:50:09,362
That's a bit uncharitable.

539
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:17,803
How are you feeling?

540
00:50:19,052 --> 00:50:21,043
Not so hot. (clears throat)

541
00:50:21,812 --> 00:50:23,723
Sore throat,...

542
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,848
..sick to my stomach.

543
00:50:25,932 --> 00:50:27,604
Pissed off.

544
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:30,001
Understandable,
given the circumstances.

545
00:50:30,092 --> 00:50:33,801
Perhaps l should give you
one of my specialcocktails.

546
00:50:33,892 --> 00:50:37,567
(Golic) l don't know why everybody
blames everybody for everything.

547
00:50:37,652 --> 00:50:40,120
Nobody's perfect. We're only human.

548
00:50:40,212 --> 00:50:43,204
l don't know a perfect human.
Nobody l know.

549
00:50:44,492 --> 00:50:46,130
You married?

550
00:50:46,212 --> 00:50:47,691
Me?

551
00:50:47,772 --> 00:50:49,808
You should get married, have kids.

552
00:50:49,892 --> 00:50:52,611
Pretty girl.

553
00:50:52,692 --> 00:50:54,842
l used to know lots ofthem. Back home.

554
00:50:56,092 --> 00:50:58,083
They used to like me.

555
00:51:00,052 --> 00:51:01,929
For a while.

556
00:51:07,012 --> 00:51:08,650
You're gonna die, too.

557
00:51:15,732 --> 00:51:17,882
(Clemens) Are you?

558
00:51:18,412 --> 00:51:19,970
What?

559
00:51:20,852 --> 00:51:22,171
Married.

560
00:51:22,252 --> 00:51:23,571
Why?

561
00:51:24,652 --> 00:51:25,880
Just curious.

562
00:51:26,412 --> 00:51:28,004
No.

563
00:51:29,852 --> 00:51:31,763
How about levelling with me?

564
00:51:33,332 --> 00:51:37,245
When l asked how you got assigned here,
you avoided the question.

565
00:51:37,332 --> 00:51:39,482
Then when l asked about the prison lD...

566
00:51:39,572 --> 00:51:43,087
..tattooed on the back ofyour head,
you ducked me again.

567
00:51:45,372 --> 00:51:47,647
lt's a long, sad story.

568
00:51:48,532 --> 00:51:50,887
And more than a little melodramatic.

569
00:51:50,972 --> 00:51:53,281
Try me.

570
00:51:55,652 --> 00:51:57,608
lf you insist.

571
00:52:01,492 --> 00:52:03,369
After my student years,...

572
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:09,251
..despite the fact that l had become...
secretly addicted...

573
00:52:09,332 --> 00:52:12,927
..to morphine,
l was considered to be most promising.

574
00:52:13,012 --> 00:52:15,321
A man with a future.

575
00:52:18,092 --> 00:52:22,324
During my first residency
l did a 36-hour stretch on an ER.

576
00:52:23,452 --> 00:52:26,444
So l went out
and l got more than a little drunk.

577
00:52:27,092 --> 00:52:29,083
Then l got called back.

578
00:52:29,172 --> 00:52:33,563
A boiler had blown in a fuel plant
and there were... 30 casualties.

579
00:52:33,652 --> 00:52:35,643
And 11 ofthem died.

580
00:52:35,732 --> 00:52:37,723
Not as a result ofthe accident,...

581
00:52:37,812 --> 00:52:41,043
..but because l prescribed
the wrong dosage of painkiller.

582
00:52:43,252 --> 00:52:47,245
And l got seven years in prison
and my licence reduced to a three-C.

583
00:52:49,692 --> 00:52:52,206
(whispers) At least l got offthe morphine.

584
00:52:52,812 --> 00:52:54,325
(whispers) l'm sorry.

585
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:58,122
l think l was let off lightly.

586
00:52:59,012 --> 00:53:01,003
Did you serve your time here?

587
00:53:02,532 --> 00:53:07,447
l got to know this motley crew quite well.
So when they stayed,...

588
00:53:07,532 --> 00:53:09,329
..l stayed.

589
00:53:11,012 --> 00:53:13,367
Nobody else would employ me.

590
00:53:16,492 --> 00:53:19,290
So... do you still trust me with a needle?

591
00:54:35,612 --> 00:54:40,049
Once again this is Rumour Control.
Here are the facts.

592
00:54:40,132 --> 00:54:43,647
At 0800 hours, prisoner Murphy,...

593
00:54:43,732 --> 00:54:48,283
..through carelessness on his part,
was found dead in vent shaft 17.

594
00:54:48,372 --> 00:54:51,967
He seems to have been sucked
into a ventilator fan.

595
00:54:52,052 --> 00:54:54,043
(panting)

596
00:54:54,132 --> 00:54:56,771
At about 2100 hours,...

597
00:54:56,852 --> 00:55:00,811
..prisoner Golic
reappeared in a deranged state.

598
00:55:00,892 --> 00:55:03,122
Prisoners Boggs and Rains are missing.

599
00:55:03,212 --> 00:55:07,649
There seems to be a good chance
that they have met with foul play...

600
00:55:07,732 --> 00:55:10,405
..at the hands of prisoner Golic.

601
00:55:12,372 --> 00:55:15,444
We need to organise
and send out a search party.

602
00:55:17,212 --> 00:55:19,965
Volunteers will be appreciated.

603
00:55:20,052 --> 00:55:22,361
(panting)

604
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:26,240
l think it's fair to say
that our smoothly-running facility...

605
00:55:26,332 --> 00:55:29,244
..has suddenly developed a few problems.

606
00:55:29,332 --> 00:55:34,201
l can only hope we are able to all
pull together over the next few days,...

607
00:55:34,292 --> 00:55:37,045
..until the rescue team
arrives for Lt. Ripley.

608
00:55:37,132 --> 00:55:41,284
- lt's here! lt got Clemens!
- Stop this raving at once!

609
00:55:41,372 --> 00:55:43,727
l'm telling you! lt's here!

610
00:55:43,812 --> 00:55:46,610
Aaron, get that foolish woman
back to the infirmary!

611
00:55:46,692 --> 00:55:47,488
Agh!

612
00:55:49,772 --> 00:55:51,364
Move it! Everybody!

613
00:55:58,012 --> 00:55:59,650
Fuck!

614
00:56:04,725 --> 00:56:08,161
(prisoner) What do we do now?
Who's in charge?

615
00:56:09,405 --> 00:56:10,360
Organise!

616
00:56:10,445 --> 00:56:11,844
We gotta organise, right?

617
00:56:11,925 --> 00:56:13,597
Right! l'm next in line.

618
00:56:13,685 --> 00:56:16,438
85's gonna be in charge.
Jesus! Give us a break!

619
00:56:16,525 --> 00:56:18,038
Don't call me that!

620
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,400
Look, there's no way
l can replace Andrews.

621
00:56:20,485 --> 00:56:23,079
He was a good man.
l know you didn't appreciate him...

622
00:56:23,165 --> 00:56:27,124
Aaron, we don't wanna hear that shit now.
Hey, sister, what about you?

623
00:56:27,205 --> 00:56:30,595
You're an officer.
How about showing us a little leadership?

624
00:56:30,685 --> 00:56:33,074
Forget fuckin' Shirley Temple!
You take charge.

625
00:56:33,165 --> 00:56:34,200
Right!

626
00:56:34,285 --> 00:56:39,200
- You run things here anyway.
- No fuckin' way. l'm not the officer type.

627
00:56:41,485 --> 00:56:43,316
l just take care of my own.

628
00:56:43,405 --> 00:56:46,477
Well, what does this fuckin' beast want?

629
00:56:48,325 --> 00:56:50,361
ls this mother gonna try for us all?

630
00:56:53,645 --> 00:56:54,600
Yeah.

631
00:56:54,685 --> 00:56:57,153
Ain't that sweet!
How are we gonna stop it?

632
00:56:57,245 --> 00:56:59,201
(clears throat)

633
00:57:02,245 --> 00:57:04,964
- You have no weapons. ls that correct?
- Right.

634
00:57:05,845 --> 00:57:08,598
l haven't seen one exactly like this before.

635
00:57:08,685 --> 00:57:10,960
lt moves differently.

636
00:57:13,005 --> 00:57:15,394
But the others were afraid offire.

637
00:57:15,485 --> 00:57:17,237
Not much else.

638
00:57:17,805 --> 00:57:19,796
Can we seal offthis area?

639
00:57:19,885 --> 00:57:22,843
No chance.
The installation's ten miles square.

640
00:57:22,925 --> 00:57:24,836
There's 600 air ducts round...

641
00:57:24,925 --> 00:57:28,804
What about video? We could find it
using these closed-circuit monitors.

642
00:57:28,885 --> 00:57:31,718
The video system hasn't worked in years.

643
00:57:31,805 --> 00:57:33,796
Nothing much works here!

644
00:57:33,885 --> 00:57:35,876
We've got technology,
no way to fix it.

645
00:57:35,965 --> 00:57:38,399
- 85 is trying to tell you...
- Don't call me that!

646
00:57:38,485 --> 00:57:42,558
..we ain't got no entertainment centre.
No climate control, no video system.

647
00:57:42,645 --> 00:57:47,116
No surveillance. No freezers.
No fuckin' ice cream.

648
00:57:47,205 --> 00:57:49,241
No rubbers, no women.

649
00:57:49,325 --> 00:57:52,283
No guns. All we got here is shit!

650
00:57:52,365 --> 00:57:56,483
What the hell are we even talking
to her for? She brought the fucker.

651
00:57:56,565 --> 00:58:01,514
Why don't we just get her head
and shove it through that fuckin' wall?!

652
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:04,116
Morse...

653
00:58:07,725 --> 00:58:10,000
Why don't you shut the fuck up?

654
00:58:16,205 --> 00:58:17,843
Right.

655
00:58:18,445 --> 00:58:19,764
Right.

656
00:58:19,845 --> 00:58:21,563
What are we going to do?

657
00:58:34,885 --> 00:58:36,603
What's this?

658
00:58:36,685 --> 00:58:42,681
lt leads from the mess hall...
to the infirmary. lt's a ventilation shaft.

659
00:58:42,765 --> 00:58:46,075
Then we go in there. Flush it out.

660
00:58:46,165 --> 00:58:49,635
Hey, look, there's miles and miles
of tunnel through there.

661
00:58:49,725 --> 00:58:52,922
(Ripley sighs) lt won't go far.

662
00:58:53,805 --> 00:58:56,035
lt'll nest in this area.

663
00:58:56,125 --> 00:58:58,764
Right around...

664
00:58:58,845 --> 00:59:00,119
..here.

665
00:59:00,725 --> 00:59:02,636
How do you know that?

666
00:59:03,605 --> 00:59:05,994
lt's like a lion.

667
00:59:06,085 --> 00:59:10,681
- lt sticks close to the zebras.
- Zebras? Oh, right.

668
00:59:10,765 --> 00:59:13,563
But running around here in the dark,
are you kidding?

669
00:59:13,645 --> 00:59:16,205
Outside ofthis main shaft
there's no overheads.

670
00:59:16,285 --> 00:59:20,119
- Don't we have flashlights?
- Thousands ofthem, but no batteries.

671
00:59:20,205 --> 00:59:24,278
Torches?
Do we have the capacity to make fire?

672
00:59:24,365 --> 00:59:27,835
Most humans have enjoyed that privilege
since the Stone Age.

673
00:59:29,045 --> 00:59:31,001
No need to be sarcastic.

674
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:36,481
Never been used. They were
gonna dump nuclear crap in there.

675
00:59:36,565 --> 00:59:39,477
Never got round to it.
lt's clean as a whistle inside.

676
00:59:39,565 --> 00:59:41,954
This is the only way... in or out?

677
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:45,640
That's right.
Walls are six feet thick. Solid steel.

678
00:59:45,725 --> 00:59:47,556
They knew how to build these babies.

679
00:59:47,645 --> 00:59:50,682
You're saying,
we get something in there,...

680
00:59:50,765 --> 00:59:53,404
- ..there's no way it can get out?
- That's right.

681
00:59:54,125 --> 00:59:56,434
No fucking way.

682
01:00:00,165 --> 01:00:01,723
(whistles)

683
01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:05,444
lt's kept here.
Forget what this stuff's called.

684
01:00:05,525 --> 01:00:08,278
- Quinitricetyline.
- l knew that.

685
01:00:08,365 --> 01:00:12,643
l've gotta get these section arrangements
uh... organised with Dillon...

686
01:00:12,725 --> 01:00:14,920
..for the... paint brush, uh...

687
01:00:15,005 --> 01:00:15,960
So, um...

688
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:17,273
- David...
- Yeah.

689
01:00:17,365 --> 01:00:20,516
- You can get these drums organised.
- Right, 85.

690
01:00:20,605 --> 01:00:22,675
And, uh...

691
01:00:22,765 --> 01:00:24,596
..don't call me that.

692
01:00:26,805 --> 01:00:30,434
What's this... 85 thing?

693
01:00:30,525 --> 01:00:33,483
A couple of us sneaked
a look at his personnel file.

694
01:00:33,565 --> 01:00:35,123
lt's his lQ.

695
01:00:36,325 --> 01:00:38,077
(Ripley chuckles)

696
01:00:40,205 --> 01:00:42,036
(liquid sloshes)

697
01:00:42,645 --> 01:00:46,877
l saw a drum ofthis stuff
fall into a beachhead bunker once.

698
01:00:46,965 --> 01:00:49,798
The blast put a tug in dry dock
for 17 weeks.

699
01:00:50,405 --> 01:00:52,316
Great stuff!

700
01:00:56,605 --> 01:00:58,675
All right, let me get this straight.

701
01:00:59,685 --> 01:01:02,995
You wanna burn it down
and out ofthe pipes,...

702
01:01:03,085 --> 01:01:06,714
..force it in here, slam the door,
and trap its ass?

703
01:01:06,805 --> 01:01:07,681
Right.

704
01:01:07,765 --> 01:01:11,474
You want help
from us Y-chromo boys, huh?

705
01:01:11,565 --> 01:01:13,317
You got something better to do?

706
01:01:13,405 --> 01:01:16,203
Why should we put our ass
on the line for you?

707
01:01:16,285 --> 01:01:18,241
Your ass is already on the line.

708
01:01:18,325 --> 01:01:20,202
The only question is...

709
01:01:20,285 --> 01:01:22,321
..what are you gonna do about it?

710
01:01:34,725 --> 01:01:37,364
Man, this stuff stinks!

711
01:01:47,165 --> 01:01:49,156
You miss Doc, right?

712
01:01:52,085 --> 01:01:54,474
What makes you say that?

713
01:01:54,565 --> 01:01:56,681
l thought you two got real close.

714
01:01:58,845 --> 01:02:01,723
l guess you've been
looking through some keyholes.

715
01:02:01,805 --> 01:02:05,514
- That's what l thought.
- Ohh! Ohh...

716
01:02:09,885 --> 01:02:12,274
l hate this place. l hate this place!

717
01:02:17,245 --> 01:02:20,078
There's definitely
something in here with us.

718
01:02:23,045 --> 01:02:26,754
Don't light the fire until l give the signal.
This is the signal.

719
01:02:27,805 --> 01:02:29,875
Got it? Can you remember that?

720
01:02:32,965 --> 01:02:34,683
Agh! Shit!

721
01:03:13,205 --> 01:03:15,355
No! No!

722
01:03:15,565 --> 01:03:16,395
No!

723
01:03:17,405 --> 01:03:18,315
Agh!

724
01:03:19,565 --> 01:03:21,317
Agh! Agh!

725
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:34,956
Wait for the fucking signal!

726
01:03:42,325 --> 01:03:43,314
Get down!

727
01:03:45,485 --> 01:03:47,362
Agh!

728
01:03:48,445 --> 01:03:51,005
Come on!
We gotta find the sprinklers!

729
01:03:51,085 --> 01:03:52,757
We gotta help these guys!

730
01:03:55,005 --> 01:03:56,404
(screaming)

731
01:04:04,285 --> 01:04:06,799
Get to the waste dump.
Don't open the door!

732
01:04:17,925 --> 01:04:19,995
Aagh!

733
01:05:05,525 --> 01:05:07,038
Dillon! Over here!

734
01:05:07,125 --> 01:05:09,116
Here's another one.

735
01:05:10,245 --> 01:05:11,883
Oh, Jesus.

736
01:05:11,965 --> 01:05:13,603
This makes ten.

737
01:05:16,845 --> 01:05:19,075
Fuckin' great!

738
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:21,804
Well, now what are we gonna do?

739
01:05:23,485 --> 01:05:26,045
- (groans)
- You OK?

740
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:29,162
Piss on her. The fuckin' thing's loose.
What are we gonna do?

741
01:05:29,245 --> 01:05:31,839
l just said that. You miserable little shit!

742
01:05:31,925 --> 01:05:33,040
Cut that shit out.

743
01:05:33,125 --> 01:05:35,514
Tell your fuckin' bozo to shape up.

744
01:05:38,205 --> 01:05:39,433
What do you think?

745
01:05:39,525 --> 01:05:42,562
l've got to get to the EEV.

746
01:05:42,645 --> 01:05:44,363
Why? What's up?

747
01:05:44,445 --> 01:05:46,640
l just have to use the neuroscanner.

748
01:05:47,725 --> 01:05:49,124
You don't look so good.

749
01:05:49,205 --> 01:05:51,082
Who gives a shit! What are we gonna do?

750
01:05:51,165 --> 01:05:54,521
Do you want a smack in the mouth,
you stupid wanker?

751
01:05:54,605 --> 01:05:55,754
Stop causing panic!

752
01:05:55,845 --> 01:05:59,997
Panic? You're so stupid, you couldn't
spell it. Don't talk to me about panic!

753
01:06:00,085 --> 01:06:01,962
Shut up, both ofyou!

754
01:06:03,005 --> 01:06:04,916
Shut up!

755
01:06:15,285 --> 01:06:18,516
- Well, l'm out of ideas!
- Doesn't surprise me.

756
01:06:20,805 --> 01:06:22,875
- What about outside?
- Oh, great idea!

757
01:06:22,965 --> 01:06:27,481
The sun doesn't come up for two days, it's
40 below zero. That makes a lot of sense!

758
01:06:27,565 --> 01:06:30,796
You want us to stay here
and let this thing have us for lunch.

759
01:06:31,685 --> 01:06:35,917
Get everybody that's still left together.
Come down to the furnace.

760
01:06:36,005 --> 01:06:37,563
OK.

761
01:07:07,165 --> 01:07:08,598
Need any help?

762
01:07:11,845 --> 01:07:16,043
l didn't mean to scare you.
You shouldn't be wandering around alone.

763
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:20,363
Do me a favour and...
run this keyboard, will you?

764
01:07:21,245 --> 01:07:22,917
OK.

765
01:07:33,565 --> 01:07:36,523
- What do l do?
- Hit B or C. What's C?

766
01:07:37,285 --> 01:07:39,879
- "Display bio-functions"?
- That's it.

767
01:07:40,325 --> 01:07:42,714
(buzzing)

768
01:07:43,365 --> 01:07:45,595
OK, we're hot. Now what?

769
01:07:45,685 --> 01:07:47,676
Let it run its cycle.

770
01:07:47,965 --> 01:07:50,035
lt's real fuzzy.

771
01:07:50,125 --> 01:07:51,524
Hit enhancement.

772
01:08:11,645 --> 01:08:13,556
Keep looking.

773
01:08:19,565 --> 01:08:21,396
l don't know how to read this stuff.

774
01:08:21,485 --> 01:08:24,761
Haemorrhaging will show as a dark patch.

775
01:08:29,445 --> 01:08:30,878
(clears throat)

776
01:08:30,965 --> 01:08:35,641
Look for... hairline fractures
through the... base ofthe skull.

777
01:08:36,325 --> 01:08:37,758
Little white lines.

778
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:47,524
What is it?

779
01:08:48,525 --> 01:08:50,914
l think you've got one inside ofyou.

780
01:08:53,685 --> 01:08:55,641
That's not possible!

781
01:08:58,245 --> 01:09:00,554
What does it look like?

782
01:09:04,925 --> 01:09:06,563
Horrible.

783
01:09:06,645 --> 01:09:08,795
(Ripley) l have to see it.

784
01:09:10,885 --> 01:09:12,079
Freeze it!

785
01:09:12,165 --> 01:09:14,633
- You don't want to look at it.
- Freeze it!

786
01:09:39,005 --> 01:09:40,757
l'm sorry.

787
01:09:48,405 --> 01:09:50,396
lt's up.

788
01:09:50,485 --> 01:09:52,794
What do you want to say?

789
01:09:52,885 --> 01:09:55,240
Tell them the whole place has gone toxic.

790
01:09:55,325 --> 01:09:59,398
Are you kidding? They won't come here.
The rescue team will turn back.

791
01:09:59,485 --> 01:10:00,998
Yeah, l know.

792
01:10:01,085 --> 01:10:02,882
What are you talking about?

793
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:05,684
Our only hope is that they kill this fucker.

794
01:10:05,765 --> 01:10:09,838
Maybe they can do something for you.
l don't know, freeze you! An operation!

795
01:10:09,925 --> 01:10:11,483
They've got the technology!

796
01:10:11,565 --> 01:10:15,524
lf this organism gets offthe planet,
it'll kill everything.

797
01:10:15,765 --> 01:10:17,915
The company doesn't care about that.

798
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:21,077
They just want it,
for their bio-weapons division, OK?

799
01:10:21,165 --> 01:10:24,077
So we can't let them come here.

800
01:10:24,165 --> 01:10:25,803
Fuck you!

801
01:10:25,885 --> 01:10:30,197
Look, l'm sorry you've got this thing
inside you, but l'm getting rescued.

802
01:10:30,285 --> 01:10:32,321
l don't care about these prisoners.

803
01:10:32,405 --> 01:10:34,794
But l've got a wife and kid.
l'm going home!

804
01:10:34,885 --> 01:10:38,082
l know. This is hard.
But l'm gonna send this message.

805
01:10:38,565 --> 01:10:40,396
l need that fucking code.

806
01:10:40,485 --> 01:10:43,363
l'm sorry, ma'am. lt's classified.

807
01:10:43,445 --> 01:10:46,118
You stupid little shit,
this has got to be done!

808
01:10:46,205 --> 01:10:48,594
There are no alternatives!

809
01:10:49,325 --> 01:10:51,600
You're not getting it! No fucking way!

810
01:10:57,765 --> 01:10:59,915
Look... it's nothing personal.

811
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:03,441
Understand? l think you're OK.

812
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:10,600
Thanks.

813
01:11:18,965 --> 01:11:22,241
- Have you got any ideas?
- l don't know. Maybe l'll go find it.

814
01:11:22,325 --> 01:11:25,522
See how smart it is.

815
01:11:25,605 --> 01:11:27,516
You're gonna go and look for it?

816
01:11:27,605 --> 01:11:29,960
Yeah.

817
01:11:30,045 --> 01:11:32,639
l have a pretty good idea where it is.

818
01:11:32,725 --> 01:11:35,444
lt's just down there.

819
01:11:35,525 --> 01:11:37,402
ln the basement.

820
01:11:37,485 --> 01:11:40,875
This whole place is a basement.

821
01:11:41,285 --> 01:11:43,435
lt's a metaphor.

822
01:11:44,205 --> 01:11:45,763
Do you wanna come?

823
01:11:49,165 --> 01:11:50,564
Fuck me!

824
01:11:50,645 --> 01:11:53,000
(buzzing)

825
01:12:22,965 --> 01:12:26,480
(buzzing continues)

826
01:13:10,525 --> 01:13:12,959
Where are you when l need you?

827
01:13:16,605 --> 01:13:19,517
(hissing sound)

828
01:13:44,405 --> 01:13:46,555
Don't be afraid.

829
01:13:48,045 --> 01:13:50,161
l'm part ofthe family.

830
01:14:54,245 --> 01:14:56,042
You've been in my life so long...

831
01:14:56,925 --> 01:14:58,995
..l can't remember anything else.

832
01:15:01,765 --> 01:15:03,881
Now do something for me.

833
01:15:05,445 --> 01:15:07,037
lt's easy.

834
01:15:07,685 --> 01:15:09,118
Just...

835
01:15:10,205 --> 01:15:12,196
Just do what you do.

836
01:15:19,725 --> 01:15:21,124
(drops pipe)

837
01:15:40,725 --> 01:15:42,317
(hissing)

838
01:15:46,165 --> 01:15:47,564
Oh!

839
01:15:55,445 --> 01:15:57,436
lt won't kill me.

840
01:15:57,525 --> 01:15:59,243
You're supposed to be laying low.

841
01:15:59,325 --> 01:16:01,281
l have one inside of me.

842
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:05,195
- What are you talking about?
- l saw it.

843
01:16:06,045 --> 01:16:07,956
On the CAT scan.

844
01:16:08,045 --> 01:16:09,478
lt's a queen.

845
01:16:10,485 --> 01:16:12,919
An egg-layer.

846
01:16:13,005 --> 01:16:14,961
lt can make thousands more.

847
01:16:15,045 --> 01:16:18,082
lt still sounds like bullshit to me.

848
01:16:19,165 --> 01:16:21,440
lf it's inside you, how did it get there?

849
01:16:21,525 --> 01:16:23,436
(sighs)

850
01:16:25,405 --> 01:16:27,965
When l was in hypersleep, l guess.

851
01:16:29,285 --> 01:16:31,515
l don't have much time.

852
01:16:32,805 --> 01:16:35,399
And l can't do what l should.

853
01:16:37,525 --> 01:16:39,641
l need you to help me.

854
01:16:43,245 --> 01:16:45,964
(whispers) l need you to kill me.

855
01:16:46,045 --> 01:16:49,674
- What are you talking about?
- l'm dead anyway.

856
01:16:49,765 --> 01:16:51,835
l can't survive it.

857
01:16:53,085 --> 01:16:56,043
But the one inside of me
can generate thousands more.

858
01:16:57,565 --> 01:16:59,237
lt has to die.

859
01:16:59,925 --> 01:17:02,234
So somebody's gotta kill me.

860
01:17:04,925 --> 01:17:06,836
Are you up to it?

861
01:17:07,885 --> 01:17:10,524
You don't have to worry about that.

862
01:17:12,965 --> 01:17:14,398
(whispers) So...

863
01:17:27,405 --> 01:17:29,361
No speeches.

864
01:17:32,405 --> 01:17:34,236
No prayers.

865
01:18:04,005 --> 01:18:06,280
(whispers) What's going on?

866
01:18:06,365 --> 01:18:10,722
l don't like losing a fight.
Not to nobody, not to nothing.

867
01:18:10,805 --> 01:18:15,481
That thing has already killed half my men
and got the other half scared shitless.

868
01:18:15,565 --> 01:18:19,524
As long as it's alive, sister,
you're not gonna save any universe.

869
01:18:19,605 --> 01:18:22,756
- You fuckin' coward!
- l want that thing!

870
01:18:24,405 --> 01:18:27,158
l wanna get this thing
and l need you to do it.

871
01:18:27,805 --> 01:18:31,161
And if it won't kill you,
then maybe that helps us fight it.

872
01:18:31,845 --> 01:18:33,403
Otherwise fuck you!

873
01:18:33,485 --> 01:18:35,760
(moans)

874
01:18:38,885 --> 01:18:40,682
Dillon!

875
01:18:41,605 --> 01:18:43,402
We waste this thing.

876
01:18:44,965 --> 01:18:47,195
- Then you take care of me.
- No problem.

877
01:18:48,365 --> 01:18:51,596
Quick, easy and painless.

878
01:18:53,125 --> 01:18:56,834
(Dillon) You die sitting here on your ass,
or you die out there.

879
01:18:56,925 --> 01:18:59,723
At least we take a shot. We owe it one!

880
01:18:59,805 --> 01:19:01,602
What the fuck are you talking about?

881
01:19:01,685 --> 01:19:04,199
l'm talking about
killing that big motherfucker.

882
01:19:04,285 --> 01:19:05,798
That doesn't mean we should fight it.

883
01:19:05,885 --> 01:19:07,477
Jesus Christ, give us a break!

884
01:19:07,565 --> 01:19:10,716
You guys have got to be fucking nuts.
l've got a wife and kid...

885
01:19:10,805 --> 01:19:13,877
Nobody gives a shit about you, 85.
You're not a believer.

886
01:19:13,965 --> 01:19:15,842
You're a fuckin' company man!

887
01:19:15,925 --> 01:19:19,281
Yeah, OK. l'm a company man,
not a fuckin' criminal.

888
01:19:20,325 --> 01:19:24,841
You tell me how dumb l am. l'm smart
enough not to have a life sentence!

889
01:19:24,925 --> 01:19:25,960
Piss off!

890
01:19:26,045 --> 01:19:26,761
Weirdo!

891
01:19:26,845 --> 01:19:30,121
And l'm smart enough to wait
for some firepower to show up...

892
01:19:30,205 --> 01:19:32,924
..before we fight this thing! Right?

893
01:19:33,005 --> 01:19:35,599
OK, just sit here, on your asses. Fine!

894
01:19:35,685 --> 01:19:38,358
How about if l sit here on my ass?

895
01:19:38,445 --> 01:19:41,596
No problem. Oh, l forgot!

896
01:19:41,685 --> 01:19:46,315
You're the guy that's made
a deal with God to live for ever, huh?

897
01:19:46,405 --> 01:19:50,523
And all the rest ofyou pussies
can sit it out, too.

898
01:19:50,605 --> 01:19:52,960
Me and her'll do all the fighting.

899
01:19:53,365 --> 01:19:55,481
OK. But l want the same thing as you.

900
01:19:55,565 --> 01:19:59,558
l want to see it dead. l hate the fucker!
lt killed my mates, too!

901
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:02,559
Why the fuck can't we wait
for the company...

902
01:20:02,645 --> 01:20:06,354
..and have some guns on our side?
Why go on a fucking suicide run?

903
01:20:06,445 --> 01:20:07,480
Right!

904
01:20:07,565 --> 01:20:09,123
Because they won't kill it.

905
01:20:09,205 --> 01:20:12,561
They might kill you for having seen it
but they won't kill it.

906
01:20:12,645 --> 01:20:16,763
That is crazy! That is horseshit!
They will not kill us!

907
01:20:19,165 --> 01:20:24,398
When they first heard about this thing,
it was "crew expendable".

908
01:20:25,085 --> 01:20:28,998
The next time, they sent in Marines.
They were expendable, too.

909
01:20:29,725 --> 01:20:33,798
What makes you think they're gonna care
about a bunch of lifers, who found God...

910
01:20:33,885 --> 01:20:35,716
..at the ass-end of space?

911
01:20:37,605 --> 01:20:41,154
You really think they're gonna let you
interfere with their plans?

912
01:20:42,125 --> 01:20:44,719
They think we're... we're crud.

913
01:20:44,805 --> 01:20:46,477
And they don't give a fuck...

914
01:20:46,565 --> 01:20:49,557
..about one friend ofyours that's...
that's died.

915
01:20:50,685 --> 01:20:51,959
Not one.

916
01:20:55,845 --> 01:20:57,836
Have you got some sort of plan?

917
01:20:57,925 --> 01:21:00,393
This is a lead works, isn't it?

918
01:21:00,485 --> 01:21:05,843
All we gotta do is lower the fuckin' beast
into the mould. Drown it in hot lead.

919
01:21:07,245 --> 01:21:09,839
Oh, right. So how do we do that?

920
01:21:09,925 --> 01:21:13,076
Yeah. What are we gonna use for bait?

921
01:21:19,165 --> 01:21:20,518
Oh, fuck!

922
01:21:20,605 --> 01:21:23,403
You're all gonna die.

923
01:21:24,445 --> 01:21:27,357
The only question is how you check out.

924
01:21:28,925 --> 01:21:33,919
Do you want it on your feet...
or on your fuckin' knees?

925
01:21:34,205 --> 01:21:35,479
Begging!

926
01:21:35,565 --> 01:21:38,159
l ain't much for begging!

927
01:21:38,245 --> 01:21:40,554
Nobody ever gave me nothing!

928
01:21:40,645 --> 01:21:44,035
So l say fuckthat thing! Let's fight it!

929
01:21:49,245 --> 01:21:52,203
Fuck it! Let's go, boys!

930
01:21:52,285 --> 01:21:53,877
OK.

931
01:21:56,645 --> 01:21:59,239
What the fuck are we gonna do
if it runs at us?

932
01:21:59,325 --> 01:22:01,634
Better have some fucking good ideas.

933
01:22:05,245 --> 01:22:08,555
(computer voice) Door 1 open.

934
01:22:08,645 --> 01:22:10,840
When was the last time
you used this place?

935
01:22:10,925 --> 01:22:12,995
We fired it up five, six years ago.

936
01:22:13,085 --> 01:22:14,962
You sure the piston's gonna work?

937
01:22:15,045 --> 01:22:17,275
There's nothing for sure in this place.

938
01:22:21,845 --> 01:22:24,154
We trap it here first,
then you pull the lever.

939
01:22:24,245 --> 01:22:28,921
The piston's gonna push it into the mould.
One ofthe guys will pour the lead.

940
01:22:29,005 --> 01:22:32,395
- End of his ass, end of story.
- What if somebody screws it up?

941
01:22:32,485 --> 01:22:35,158
We're fucked.
You got one chance, one shot at it.

942
01:22:35,245 --> 01:22:38,282
There'll be no time to reset it.
Now, remember,...

943
01:22:38,925 --> 01:22:41,120
..you pull the lever.

944
01:22:41,205 --> 01:22:44,914
For a few seconds you're gonna be
trapped in here with that thing.

945
01:22:45,005 --> 01:22:46,882
You guys don't drop the ball, l won't.

946
01:22:46,965 --> 01:22:50,082
You better be right about
that thing not wanting you.

947
01:22:50,165 --> 01:22:52,759
Because if it wants out,
that's how it's gonna go.

948
01:22:52,845 --> 01:22:55,359
Through that alcove, through you.

949
01:22:55,885 --> 01:22:58,524
- Where are you gonna be?
- l'll be around.

950
01:22:58,605 --> 01:23:00,482
What about the others?

951
01:23:00,565 --> 01:23:02,157
Praying.

952
01:23:04,205 --> 01:23:06,480
- l have a problem with this.
- What part?

953
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:10,319
Where we're running in the dark
fuckin' maze with that thing chasing us.

954
01:23:10,405 --> 01:23:13,317
You lead it down channel B
to the piston chamber.

955
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:15,680
l'll close the doors behind you.

956
01:23:18,365 --> 01:23:22,119
Hey! What if it won't cooperate?
What ifwe get lost?

957
01:23:27,525 --> 01:23:29,402
This was her idea.

958
01:23:44,205 --> 01:23:46,958
l don't know about this shit.

959
01:23:47,045 --> 01:23:50,754
Hey, guys! My door ain't working!

960
01:23:50,845 --> 01:23:52,915
What the fuck is he saying?

961
01:23:53,005 --> 01:23:56,475
l think we better rethink this thing!

962
01:24:03,405 --> 01:24:05,441
(distant) Aargh!

963
01:24:06,405 --> 01:24:09,477
Did anybody hear anything?

964
01:24:19,925 --> 01:24:20,994
Come on!

965
01:24:21,085 --> 01:24:23,599
Come and get me, you fucker!

966
01:24:24,885 --> 01:24:26,238
lt's behind me!

967
01:24:26,805 --> 01:24:28,033
lt's started.

968
01:24:28,885 --> 01:24:30,762
lt's still behind me!

969
01:24:31,845 --> 01:24:33,324
lt's in channel B!

970
01:24:33,405 --> 01:24:36,761
lt's behind me! Shut the doors!

971
01:24:36,845 --> 01:24:39,040
Must be heading over to channel A!

972
01:24:44,005 --> 01:24:46,519
This thing is really pissed off!

973
01:24:46,605 --> 01:24:48,436
- Did you say B?
- No, E!

974
01:24:48,525 --> 01:24:51,164
- But you said we should stay here!
- Move your ass!

975
01:24:52,325 --> 01:24:53,838
Morse?

976
01:24:56,685 --> 01:24:58,880
Kevin!

977
01:25:07,405 --> 01:25:12,195
Yoo-hoo! Hey, fuckface!
Come and get me!

978
01:25:12,285 --> 01:25:13,638
(hissing)

979
01:25:13,725 --> 01:25:15,681
Aargh!

980
01:25:16,525 --> 01:25:19,961
You can't get me!

981
01:25:22,485 --> 01:25:23,804
A-7 closed!

982
01:25:25,685 --> 01:25:26,879
(yelling)

983
01:25:28,445 --> 01:25:31,596
Over in the east wing!
Door B-7 safe!

984
01:25:37,605 --> 01:25:38,560
Agh!

985
01:25:44,845 --> 01:25:46,563
- You, too?
- Yeah!

986
01:25:46,645 --> 01:25:48,203
Over to E, everybody!

987
01:25:48,285 --> 01:25:50,321
- Where the fuck is E?!
- This way!

988
01:26:07,845 --> 01:26:10,837
Here! Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!

989
01:26:10,925 --> 01:26:12,916
Here, kitty, kitty...

990
01:26:17,045 --> 01:26:19,081
You bastard!

991
01:26:19,165 --> 01:26:20,883
(hissing)

992
01:26:20,965 --> 01:26:22,114
lt's coming!

993
01:26:23,605 --> 01:26:25,721
lt's coming down through this tunnel!

994
01:26:25,805 --> 01:26:27,238
lt's after us!

995
01:26:28,285 --> 01:26:30,480
Shut the fucking doors!

996
01:26:30,565 --> 01:26:32,556
Jesus! l can fucking see it!

997
01:26:33,445 --> 01:26:36,994
Dillon, anybody! This is not a drill!

998
01:26:37,085 --> 01:26:41,556
Kevin! Gregor! Where the fuck are you?!

999
01:26:41,645 --> 01:26:43,795
Kevin!

1000
01:26:43,885 --> 01:26:46,080
Now l'm back in A!

1001
01:26:50,085 --> 01:26:51,359
(panting)

1002
01:26:59,605 --> 01:27:02,756
Door three, F channel closed!

1003
01:27:04,045 --> 01:27:05,603
l hope.

1004
01:27:07,405 --> 01:27:09,441
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What?

1005
01:27:09,525 --> 01:27:11,595
Don't hold it like that. Like this!

1006
01:27:11,685 --> 01:27:14,199
You could kill someone,
you fuckin' moron!

1007
01:27:18,125 --> 01:27:19,114
(hissing)

1008
01:27:19,205 --> 01:27:19,842
Aargh!

1009
01:27:20,685 --> 01:27:21,640
Morse!

1010
01:27:21,725 --> 01:27:22,794
Kevin!

1011
01:27:25,285 --> 01:27:26,957
Gregor!

1012
01:27:27,045 --> 01:27:29,923
All they have to do is
run down the damn corridor.

1013
01:27:30,605 --> 01:27:32,596
Stay here.

1014
01:27:34,565 --> 01:27:36,442
Where the hell is it?

1015
01:27:36,525 --> 01:27:38,516
(distant shouting)

1016
01:28:09,645 --> 01:28:10,361
(hissing)

1017
01:28:10,445 --> 01:28:11,719
Aargh!

1018
01:28:13,445 --> 01:28:15,481
(distant) lt's coming!

1019
01:28:15,565 --> 01:28:17,442
Oh, Jesus!

1020
01:28:21,805 --> 01:28:22,874
There!

1021
01:28:25,125 --> 01:28:27,161
(Ripley) No! Don't start the piston!

1022
01:28:27,765 --> 01:28:28,436
No!

1023
01:28:28,525 --> 01:28:30,243
We have to trap it!

1024
01:28:30,325 --> 01:28:32,202
What are you doing? lt's gone!

1025
01:28:32,285 --> 01:28:34,241
No! No.

1026
01:28:36,365 --> 01:28:37,764
lt's gone!

1027
01:28:38,605 --> 01:28:39,674
OK?

1028
01:28:41,365 --> 01:28:43,117
OK.

1029
01:28:48,325 --> 01:28:50,281
Oh!

1030
01:29:11,285 --> 01:29:13,276
(Kevin screams)

1031
01:29:15,965 --> 01:29:16,954
Argh!

1032
01:29:17,045 --> 01:29:18,683
Agh! Argh!

1033
01:29:21,245 --> 01:29:22,280
Kevin!

1034
01:29:23,765 --> 01:29:25,596
No! Don't move! No.

1035
01:29:26,445 --> 01:29:27,434
Aargh!

1036
01:29:28,085 --> 01:29:28,835
Come on!

1037
01:29:28,925 --> 01:29:31,120
Come on! Come on! Come on!

1038
01:29:32,125 --> 01:29:33,763
- The doors.
- lt's coming!

1039
01:29:35,845 --> 01:29:37,119
Take the piston!

1040
01:29:39,845 --> 01:29:41,722
- Ah! Oh!
- lt's all right.

1041
01:29:42,885 --> 01:29:45,524
lt's OK. lt's all right, Kevin.

1042
01:29:46,165 --> 01:29:47,518
Kevin.

1043
01:29:47,605 --> 01:29:48,924
Kevin!

1044
01:29:51,525 --> 01:29:53,993
(hissing)

1045
01:29:57,245 --> 01:29:58,598
(whispers) Leave him!

1046
01:29:58,685 --> 01:30:00,880
Leave him! He's dead. Lure it in.

1047
01:30:03,245 --> 01:30:05,361
(hissing)

1048
01:30:14,445 --> 01:30:16,515
Shit! How much time?

1049
01:30:16,605 --> 01:30:19,995
l'm not sure. Four or five minutes.
But we got to get it back in here...

1050
01:30:20,085 --> 01:30:23,475
..before the piston seals this place off!
Now let's move it!

1051
01:30:24,165 --> 01:30:25,803
Oh!

1052
01:30:35,845 --> 01:30:37,437
(yelling)

1053

1142
01:39:26,405 --> 01:39:28,965

l just felt it move.

1147
01:39:41,805 --> 01:39:44,194
- You know who l am?
- You're a droid.

1148
01:39:44,285 --> 01:39:47,960
Same model as Bishop.
Sent by the fucking company.

1149
01:39:48,045 --> 01:39:51,924
No. l'm not the Bishop android.

1150
01:39:52,005 --> 01:39:54,155
l designed it.

1151
01:39:54,245 --> 01:39:58,921
l'm very human. The company
sent me here to show you a friendly face.

1152
01:39:59,005 --> 01:40:02,759
To demonstrate
how important you are to us.

1153
01:40:02,845 --> 01:40:04,244
To me.

1154
01:40:04,325 --> 01:40:07,442
- You wanna take it back.
- We want to kill it and take you home.

1155
01:40:07,525 --> 01:40:08,594
Bullshit.

1156
01:40:08,685 --> 01:40:11,836
You're wrong. We want to help.

1157
01:40:11,925 --> 01:40:14,723
What does that mean?

1158
01:40:14,805 --> 01:40:17,035
We're going to take that out ofyou.

1159
01:40:17,765 --> 01:40:18,834
Keep it.

1160
01:40:18,925 --> 01:40:22,679
We can't allow it to live. Everything
we know would be in jeopardy.

1161
01:40:25,125 --> 01:40:28,674
- You don't want to take it back?
- Ripley, time is important.

1162
01:40:28,765 --> 01:40:33,520
We've got a surgical bay set up
on the rescue ship. Come with me.

1163
01:40:35,805 --> 01:40:38,114
You still can have a life.

1164
01:40:39,165 --> 01:40:40,644
Children.

1165
01:40:41,405 --> 01:40:43,361
And most important...

1166
01:40:43,445 --> 01:40:45,197
..you'll know it's dead.

1167
01:40:45,285 --> 01:40:47,560
Let me help you.

1168
01:40:48,605 --> 01:40:51,324
What guarantee do l have...

1169
01:40:52,565 --> 01:40:54,635
..once you've taken it out...

1170
01:40:54,965 --> 01:40:56,956
..that you'll destroy it?

1171
01:40:57,845 --> 01:40:59,722
You have to trust me.

1172
01:41:04,925 --> 01:41:06,278
Please.

1173
01:41:06,365 --> 01:41:07,764
Trust me.

1174

No.

1175
01:41:23,605 --> 01:41:25,357
What's this gonna achieve?

1176
01:41:25,445 --> 01:41:26,400
Argh!

1177
01:41:26,485 --> 01:41:27,315

1178
01:41:27,405 --> 01:41:29,282

- Argh! Aargh!!
- Morse...

1180
01:41:34,725 --> 01:41:36,158
Will you help me?

1181
01:41:36,245 --> 01:41:38,759
What do you want me to do?

1182
01:41:42,485 --> 01:41:45,045
lt was a mistake.
There was no need for any of it.

1183
01:41:45,125 --> 01:41:46,399
Fuckin' android!

1184
01:42:03,005 --> 01:42:04,438
(Bishop) Ripley!

1185
01:42:04,525 --> 01:42:07,278
Think of all we could learn from it.

1186
01:42:07,365 --> 01:42:10,357
lt's the chance of a lifetime!

1187
01:42:10,445 --> 01:42:12,003
You must let me have it!

1188
01:42:12,085 --> 01:42:14,519
lt's a magnificent specimen.

1189
01:42:34,765 --> 01:42:36,756
What are you doing?

1190
01:42:40,205 --> 01:42:42,480
No!

1191
01:42:52,925 --> 01:42:56,634
