10

<i>just outside the town of Deadwood.</i>

11
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,357
<i>I suppose there was a rough justice to it,</i>

12
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,190
<i>the way he met his end after sending</i>
<i>so many others to early graves.</i>

13
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,757
<i>It didn't make the moment easier</i>
<i>on any of his friends.</i>

14
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,590
I don't know why he never slept in my bed
sinced he come to Deadwood.

15
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,280
Only got interested once.

16
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,115
The timing was just wrong.

17
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,674
Too much had happened to him
before he got here.

18
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,714
I was awful attached to him.

19
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,872
All of us were. He had
that kind of effect on people.

20
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,469
I got a feeling maybe in some ways
you knew him best, Charley.

You know, I don't mind you shootin'
glasses off of my dog's head, Marshal,

23
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,032
but fondlin' him like that,
you'll ruin him for fightin'.

24
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,119
That dog's bred for fightin'.
You oughta understand that.

25
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,277
You've had more fights than anybody.

28

<i>By luck or design, it had fallen to him</i>
<i>to play the hero's part,</i>

Two damn weeks,

31
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,548

That's a funeral platform.

35
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,197
Must be on some kind of vigil

<i>(speaks Sioux)</i>

37
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,996
Says he's a Sioux,
named He Who Whistles.

38
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,596
He's a chief.

39
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,509
That's his wife lying there next to him.

40
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,234
They had to leave a tribe.

41
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,079
They couldn't find no buffalo.

42
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,916
Figured since he'd failed his people
and he'd failed his wife,

43
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,793
he had to go off
and find his own medicine.

44
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,434
Said he had a dream.

45
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,519
Had to fight a white-eye with long hair.

46
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,960
That looks to be you, Bill.

47
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,039
What the hell does this whistler
want to fight me for?

48
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,515
His religion.

49
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,676
He wins, his people live.

50
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,236
He's gonna hang your scalp
on a lodge pole.

51
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,872
Tell him I'm sorry
about his woman and his tribe.

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,635
Bad luck to kill an Indian
in a religious frame of mind!

60
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,910
He chose it!

61
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,077
He must have got more than 20 hides
out there. Winter prime.

62
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,910
Them hides'll fetch a dollar apiece in
Omaha. Let's run him off. What say you?

peacefully along the river

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,674

by a party of hostiles.

- <i>(war drum)</i>
- Hostiles? What kind of hostiles?

Indians!

130
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,071
Yes. What tribe of Indians, Wild Bill?

131
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,350
- They were Sioux. Sioux Indians.
- And who was their chief?

132
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:17,510
Up there! Turn down the damn light.
Damn near blind a feller.

133

Keep your eyes open.

136
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,313
You have glaucoma, Mr Hickok.

137
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:40,436
It's often a result from too much proximity
to, uh... infected females.

138
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,472
Keep your eyes straight ahead.
If you take my meaning.

139
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,195
I had some trouble about ten years back.

140
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,711
Cleared right up when the local doc
stuck a hot wire up my privates.

141
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,840
How bad's it gonna get?

142
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,348
You are losing your eyesight, Mr Hickok.

143
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,756
May take... two years,

144
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,394
may take... ten.

145
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,720

Yes, but it's not the same for you.
You don't know what real poverty is.

159
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,592
Mr Hickok, there's a man in the street
gonna give me a dollar

160
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:23,159
to come in here and tell you that
you're a coward, and a wife stealer...

161
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,716
and I can't say the rest,
but it was much worse.

You gonna ride or hide?
What's the matter?

What'd he <i>say?</i>

169
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,549
He said that you were a horse molester.

170
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,236
He say what horse?

171
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,429
What, are you hidin'?

172
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:18,350
The great Wild Bill Hickok
is actually inside hidin'?

173
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,430
- <i>(man)</i> What's this?
- <i>(man #2)</i> Wild Bill in a wheelchair!

174
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,036
Needless to say, Bill, all good fortune.

175
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,594
<i>I never saw a greater compliment to Bill</i>

176
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,712
<i>than that paid</i>
<i>by the citizens of Cheyenne.</i>

177
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,356
<i>Their confidence in his marksmanship</i>
<i>was such that none of them ran for cover,</i>

178
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,712
<i>but lined up as if they were watching</i>
<i>some athletic contest.</i>

179
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,031
- A whisky, please. Neat.
- You ain't gonna go out and watch this?

180
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,549
I don't think my friend needs my help.

181
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,389
I generally stay in the bar when he
gets involved with this sort of affair.

182
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,559
You just help yourself,
cos I ain't gonna miss it.

183
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,630
Here's to you, Bill.

184
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,995
<i>This dispute had begun two years before,</i>
<i>when one Ed Plummer had called Bill out.</i>

185
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,598
<i>Some said the reason</i>
<i>was a gambling debt.</i>

186
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,076
<i>Others claimed that it involved a woman.</i>

187
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:46,712
<i>Bill discovered that the Plummers</i>
<i>regarded the affair as a family matter.</i>

188
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,515
Argh! My leg!

189
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,954
I can't move my leg!

190
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,638
Aaargh!

191
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,072
Damn it, Will Plummer. I already shot you
once when you tried to bushwhack me.

192
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,352
You hear that? The man is accusing me.

193
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,755
Imagine that.

194
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,398
Have you forgotten, Mr Hickok,
that I am the aggrieved party here?

195
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,830
You must be drunk or gone crazy, Will.

196
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,714
Now, if you got any sense left,
you'll just head on home.

197
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,276
No, no. You're not gonna get off that easy.

198
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,517
You took the life from my brother.

199
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,474
And you left me a crippled old man
in a wheelchair.

200
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,909
You, sir, will die!

201
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,589
Mister, Wild Bill
just shot Will Plummer dead.

202
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,032
Then he told me to come ask you if you'd
mind to get the lead out of your ass...

203
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,039
sir... and come outside
and help untie him.

204
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,720
Will Plummer, rest in peace.

205
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,115
We owe God a death.

206
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,071
<i>Bill chose to move on to the town</i>
<i>that was the talk of the entire West.</i>

207
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,117
DEADWOOD GULCH,
DAKOTA TERRITORY, AUGUST 1876
<i>Gold had been discovered a year before.</i>

208
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,198
<i>"Get rich quick" was in the air.</i>

209
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:31,668
<i>From raw wilderness, suddenly up came</i>
<i>this hell-roaring place called Deadwood.</i>

210
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,836
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

211
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,359
You, uh, haul our bags
over to the tent city.

212
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,519
Tell 'em to find room
for Bill Hickok and a friend.

213
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,193
How are the eyes, Bill?
Going to be a lot of strangers in this town.

214
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,596
Ah, I can see OK straight ahead.

215
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,871
The sides are narrowin' in, and it hurts.

216
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,118
Comes and goes,
but hurts like hell when it's on you.

217
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,995
This town. I really think it's like
something out of the Bible.

218
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,989
- What part of the Bible?
- The part right before God gets angry.

219
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,111
<i>(whooping and cheering)</i>

220
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,556
<i>Deadwood was a haven</i>
<i>for cardsharps, con men,</i>

221
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,992
<i>thieves, killers, roughs, drunks,</i>
<i>pimps and whores...</i>

222
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,155
<i>along with those arbiters of disputes:</i>
<i>Whip, fist, knife and pistol.</i>

223
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,116
These two fellers must have
caused some trouble.

224
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,596
No trouble, just a couple of card cheats.

225
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,359
That's the worst kind of feller.

226
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,073
Man that cheats at cards
ain't got no religion.

227
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,553
Howdy, Jane.

228
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,671
Howdy, Bill.

229
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,793
Boys! This here is James Butler Hickok.

230
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,433
<i>(cheering and whooping)</i>

231
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,314
Everybody to the bar!
Drinks are on Bill!

232
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,435
Wild Bill. Carl Mann.

233
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,597
Pleased to meet you. This here's
my place, Mann's Number 10.

234
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,315
Make it your personal headquarters.
What kind of whisky do you favour?

235
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,798
Well, Carl, I prefer it in a glass.
Other than that, it's all good.

236
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,355
- That's the great Hickok?
- Sure as hell is.

237
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,430
He'll buy you a drink, shake your hand,
and you can tell your grandkids about it.

238
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,791
Charles Prince, of London, New York
and parts west, friend of Wild Bill's.

239
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,992
I know you're Calamity Jane.
He's spoken of you many times.

240
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,348
Joe!

241
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,438
Half a grand howdy, pard!

242
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,712
The whole town's crazy. Every polecat
in the territory's looking for gold.

243
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,278
They ain't even got a sheriff yet.
I figure I'll nominate you for the job.

244
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,834
- Wild Bill?
- <i>(Joe)</i> They got varmints here that...

245
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,554
What are you doing?

246
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,752
Wild Bill, I'm talkin' to you.

247
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,395
You'd better look out when
you walk down the street in this town.

248
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,877
You listen careful to every sound.
I come here to kill you.

249
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,673
He's not wearing a gun, Bill.

250
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:09,759
The man that kills Wild Bill
is gonna be awful famous.

251
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,836
<i>(laughter)</i>

252
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,356
You come here to kill me?
Let me give you some advice.

253
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,553
If you have to shoot a man,
you shoot him in the guts.

254
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,830
Might not kill him.

255
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,520
Sometimes they die slow.

256
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,115
But it'll paralyse his brain,
and the fight's as good as over.

257
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,872
Why don't you shoot the little snot?
At least rough him up some.

258
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,754
- He's just a dumb-ass kid.
- I got...

259
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,235
You son of a bitch!

260
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,189
- How you been, Bill?
- Middlin'. Just middlin'.

261
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,437
I ain't seen you in two, maybe three years.

262
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,516
Well, I'm still here.

263
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,074
- How you been?
- Well, I'm still here too.

264
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,158
Lots of towns, lots of camps.

265
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,279
Good to see you, Jane.
I like seeing old friends.

266
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,791
It's just for old times' sake.

267
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,913
- You wipin' it off?
- No. I'm rubbin' it in.

268
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,316
You can see me about as much as you
want. I guess that's always been the case.

269
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,398
I'm just a little too available.

270
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,157
I gotta be available too. Awful lot
of people want a piece of Wild Bill.

271
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,358
Let's have us a card game and a drink.

272
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,556
Outta my way, boys.

273
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,389
<i>As Bill played cards</i>
<i>and drank whisky on into the night,</i>

274
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,913
<i>Deadwood proceeded with its own</i>
<i>forced levity and bizarre behaviour.</i>

275
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:55,036
<i>The Dakota Dance Hall was</i>
<i>the preferred site for assignations.</i>

276
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,118
<i>This was no rude crib or flimsy shack.</i>

277
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,198
<i>It featured papered walls,</i>
<i>comfortable furniture,</i>

278
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:06,474
<i>polished spittoons,</i>
<i>and a piano that was actually in tune.</i>

279
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,357
You don't touch me. I saw
what you were doing. I don't like it.

280
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,152
Maybe you oughta.

281
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,555
You picked the wrong one,
cos I don't care.

282
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,956
Ow! Owww!

283
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,036
Ow! My ear!

284
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,358
Are they shakin'? My hands?

285
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,796
Are they shakin'?

286
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,388
This your first time?

287
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,638
I'm showin' you
Wild Bill don't scare me none.

288
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,036
He's right over there in the Number 10.

289
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,915
- How come you're after Wild Bill?
- I got personal reasons.

290
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,392
- What'd you say your name is, anyhow?
- Lurline.

291
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,230
Lurline Newcomb from Lawrence,
Kansas. But I been all over.

292
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,316
I bet you have.

293
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,160
I kinda like that name Lurline.

294
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,075
You were talking about Dave McCandless.

295
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,591
- You were sayin' of McCandless, Bill?
- He wasn't sayin' a goddamn thing.

296
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,998
You keep nosin' that around along with
Dave Tutt and how he took Bill's watch,

297
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,237
and them soldiers beat him
half to death in Hays City.

298
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,512
- I heard you killed seven men, Bill.
- He didn't have no reputation before that.

299
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,110
He just drove freight wagons.
It happened at Rock Creek Station.

300
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,030
Bill was taken with a woman kept by
the outlaw and horse thief McCandless.

301
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,673
Her name was Sarah.

302
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,715
McCandless and his bunch, ten men in all,
rode up lookin' to settle things.

303
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,278
Inside the station, Bill seen an old buffalo
gun. He wasn't sure it would shoot.

304
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,675
McCandless yelled
"We know you're in there,

305
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:38,396
and you've breathed your last breath
for messin' with my girl!"

306
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,153
Wild Bill was shot and cut bad
when they laid on him,

307
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,238
but he met 'em shootin', stabbin',
shoutin', hackin'.

308
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,035
He kicked and bit and kneed 'em down
till the air was blue with smoke

309
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,071
and the floor was wet with blood.

310
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:57,958
Ten men lay dead or dyin', and his boots
was fillin' with the blood of 16 wounds.

311
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,108
He thanked God and walked out into
the blindin' light before he fell over,

312
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,677
and that all happened July 12, 1861.
You can look it up.

313
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,314
I think it was maybe five killed.

314
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,989
- Are you all right, Bill?
- I'm fine, Charley.

315
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,673
I just need me some night air.

316
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,750
- Now, what set him off?
- Five men, Bill?

317
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,718
Well, hell, I thought it was seven!

318
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,120
The young kid stole a horse,

319
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,030
somebody said the Chinaman
looked the wrong way at a white woman,

320
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:06,678
and the Indian was in town tradin'
when we got the word about Custer.

321
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,837
We're gonna hang them all on Saturday.

322
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,149
<i>In the Chinese section of Deadwood,</i>

323
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:06,195
<i>there was generally available</i>
<i>a remedy for the restless spirit.</i>

324
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,756
<i>Bill was susceptible to its application.</i>

325
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,196
<i>(in Chinese)</i> Take it.
Afterwards, you'll have good dreams.

326
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,558
It will take you to a special place.

327
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,278
Dog soldiers. Cheyenne.

328
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,356
<i>(speaks Cheyenne)</i>

329
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,275
He said you saw a little dog. Um...
Can't make much sense out of it.

330
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,960
They followed your tracks.

331
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,877
Did the little dog speak to you?
The little dog's special medicine, sacred.

332
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,560
No! It's mine!

333
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,035
I'll kill you!

334
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,628
Argh! God!

335
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,595
Tell them I spoke to the little dog.

336
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,631
<i>(speaks Cheyenne)</i>

337
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:58,873
Tell them the little dog took me
to a holy place, then it disappeared.

338
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,956
<i>(Joe speaks Cheyenne)</i>

339
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,399
Then we went to the other world.

340
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:16,516
Tell them the little dog told me
that I was blessed. I'd live a long life.

341
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,396
<i>(speaks Cheyenne)</i>

342
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,155
Says you're a damn fine liar.

343
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,428
Says you saved yourself
and your friends for today.

344
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,157
But if he catches you killin' any buffalo
or takin' hides, the Cheyenne'll kill you.

345
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,912
What'd he tell you, Joe?

346
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,828
He said the next time
you saw the little dog,

347
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,111
you wouldn't live to see another moon.

348
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,236
<i>(footsteps)</i>

349
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,000
You OK, Bill?

350
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,554
I'm fine. No need to worry.

351
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,036
I damn well did get all concerned.

352
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,391
Nobody knew where you'd got to.

353
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,592
Had a hell of a time
findin' where you'd been.

354
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,110
Maybe I drank a little too much last night.

355
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,628
Had me some dreams.

356
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,752
Had too much on that Chinese pipe.

357
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,440
You're lookin' mighty peaked.

358
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,908
You wanna tell me
what you was dreamin' about?

359
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,309
About me and California Joe.

360
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,837
Things we did
when we come across some Indians

361
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,758
on a buffalo hunt six, seven years back.

362
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,075
What things? Bad things?

363
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,671
You know, they say sometimes
a dream might be a foretellin'.

364
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,997
Wasn't just a dream, it was a fact.
Gimme some room, Jane.

365
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,475
I gotta clear my head.

366
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,634
You ain't the same, Bill.

367
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,354
- How's that?
- I don't know.

368
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,473
You just... got kinda
different from before is all.

369
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,114
Maybe. I don't know.

370
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,198
You got a bathhouse in this town?

371
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,675
Sure could use one.

372
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,038
Howdy.

373
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,278
- What you doin' here?
- Maybe I'm just bein' friendly.

374
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,757
It ain't that I don't appreciate it.
I just got a lot of things to do today.

375
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,156
- What things?
- Weigh up my methods.

376
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,794
I'm gonna stir up old Wild Bill.

377
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,471
You'd better listen to me, because I know
where your Mr Wild Bill was last night.

378
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,717
One of them Chinese girls
told an upstairs girl that told me

379
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,230
that he went down to Song Lew's
and had himself a pipe.

380
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,955
You tell your friend, next time
he goes in there, tell me about it.

381
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,436
I'll make it worth her while. Yours, too.

382
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,918
You know, you can move all your plunder
into my room if you want.

383
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,873
It's the first room at the top of the stairs.

384
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,629
Maybe I'd better stay on
out at the tent city.

385
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,755
What's the problem?

386
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,996
No problem.

387
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,271
I think it just might be best if I stay out...

388
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,153
You got yourself some new gal?

389
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,155
I just ain't in the mood.

390
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,956
Well, you must have
got yourself some new gal.

391
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,709
You know, I don't ever remember askin'
to be the only thing in your life,

392
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,956
or you in mine, for that matter.

393
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:51,039
But what we had was kinda special,
and I don't see why we can't have it now,

394
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:56,109
so I would just like some kind of goddamn
explanation. You owe me that much.

395
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,472
I don't owe nobody nothin'.
I don't explain myself.

396
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,432
Not to you, not to some punk-ass kid!

397
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,516
Not to nobody!

398
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,789
Now, just run along and leave me be.

399
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,558
Sure thing.

400
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,513
And to hell with you, Mr Wild Bill!

401
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:27,353
<i>In truth, Bill felt some remorse</i>
<i>for his argument with Jane.</i>

402
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:33,396
<i>But it was the nature of their friendship</i>
<i>that feelings for one another go unstated.</i>

403
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,715
<i>Typical for a man of action,</i>

404
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:40,391
<i>Bill found romance</i>
<i>the most perplexing aspect of his life.</i>

405
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,751
Bill! Look what I got! This damn kid!

406
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,231
People said bring him. I bringed him!

407
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,112
<i>(laughter)</i>

408
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:03,509
Well, look what we got here. I'd stick
him in the manure bin if I was you, Joe.

409
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,835
Take him around back and shoot him.

410
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,111
He's makin' all kinds of trouble, Bill.
Skunk stuff, all of it.

411
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,437
Insulted some ladies,
broke some china over to the store.

412
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,791
He even claims that you told him to do it!

413
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,234
Here. You see to the damage.

414
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,476
- What name do you go by?
- Jack McCall.

415
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,434
Joe, cut his ropes.

416
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:38,111
Hear you been misbehavin', Jack.
What's the problem between me and you?

417
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,277
I don't like the way you treated my ma.

418
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,392
How you done whatever then you left her.

419
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:49,435
She kept track of you. She had lots
of stories from newspapers, dime novels.

420
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,348
I told her she should write you.
She said you wouldn't answer no letter.

421
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,755
- Who was she?
- A decent lady.

422
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,112
Miss Susannah Moore.

423
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,796
Greetings, Jack.

424
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,753
Charles Prince, friend of Bill's.

425
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:12,556
Could be that Wild Bill's made
a few mistakes over the years, but...

426
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,071
Well, it's understandable. But past is past.

427
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,475
Shut up, Charley.

428
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,191
Yeah, shut up, Charley.

429
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,708
I planned killin' you
from the time I found out

430
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:30,231
the man that ruined my ma
was a great hero to the country.

431
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,111
I'm gonna give you a chance in life, Jack.

432
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:39,075
I don't wanna kill nobody
so young and confused about things.

433
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:44,433
Joe, get him a horse, would you?
Put him on it and point him east.

434
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:50,510
East is where fellers like him oughta live,
but my recommendation is still to kill him.

435
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:07,391
I liked your ma. She was
a good, fine woman. Awful pretty.

436
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,958
This here's been
a real pleasure, Mr Hickok.

437
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:17,631
Not a word to your mother.
I don't wanna cause her no trouble.

438
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,433
She's dead six months.

439
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,518
I've been on your trail ever since.

440
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,116
<i>(thunderclap)</i>

441
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,631
It's gonna take some stitches.
That's what you get for actin' ornery.

442
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:49,880
Everybody in town's heard how the great
Wild Bill knocked you around. Hold still.

443
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,470
Now, you just don't worry about it none.

444
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,160
I accomplished my purposes.

445
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,958
<i>The rumour of Jack McCall's purpose</i>
<i>had spread through Deadwood.</i>

446
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,197
<i>The circumstances called for a killing.</i>

447
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:12,075
<i>There would be no shortage of killers</i>
<i>to heed the summons.</i>

448
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,035
You're Jack McCall?

449
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:25,518
- Whatever it is, I ain't interested.
- I'm Donnie. Donnie Lonigan.

450
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,995
I figure you and me
got things to talk about.

451
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:33,274
- That right? Where you from, Donnie?
- New York. Came here to find the gold.

452
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,154
- Had a bad run of luck.
- Who's your friend?

453
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,317
Jubal Pickett. Pleased to meet you.

454
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,916
I say just throw 'em out, Jack.
They just look to be street trash.

455
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,950
A five-dollar whore's
gonna tell me about street trash?

456
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,036
Oh, now.

457
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,596
Donnie, let's be polite.

458
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,473
How can I help you fellers?

459
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,160
We heard you're gonna be
paying to kill a man.

460
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,236
You hears wrong.

461
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,198
You gonna do it by yourself, Jack?

462
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,276
All alone?

463
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,998
I doubt you ever even shot a feller.

464
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,909
Bill Hickok. He'd be
at least a thousand dollars.

465
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,190
He's a two-gun plainsman.

466
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:30,235
And in addition, he carries a derringer
in his vest pocket as a hide-out.

467
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:35,275
He's killed at least 20 people. That's
not countin' what he done in the war.

468
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:41,396
I got three more fellers that work for me.
They like to take chances for money.

469
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,355
Well, I ain't there yet, Donnie,
but you boys stay in touch.

470
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:00,795
Well, hallelujah. Let's lift up our hands
tonight and praise the Lord. Hallelujah!

471
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:06,074
Hallelujah! How I love the Lord!
I love him, because he is able!

472
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:11,274
I love him, because he reached down and
he pulled me right from the gutters of sin!

473
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:17,077
I love him, because when sin and
sickness had me bound, he reached out.

474
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,159
He washed me in his precious blood.

475
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:27,628
Oh, hallelujah. And I am here to testify
tonight that it is my determination!

476
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,436
I will hold on! I will hold on
to the rock that is my salvation!

477
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,949
I will hold on to the word of God!

478
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:39,517
I will hold on to him!
Oh, yes, Satan, you can't touch me now!

479
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,791
Come on, you dirty devil!
I said you can't touch me now!

480
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,037
Oh, hallelujah.
Lift up your hands. Praise the Lord.

481
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,720
Hallelujah. Praise him.

482
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,229
Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.

483
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,194
Thank you, Jesus.

484
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,073
Amen. Thank you, Jesus.

485
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,156
Thank you, Jesus.

486
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,472
- Who's that feller?
- Yankee. Name of Bill Hickok.

487
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:28,037
He's awful dashin', ain't he? They say
he was spyin' around here during the war.

488
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,630
- He's lookin' at you.
- Look all he wants, won't do no good.

489
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,796
I bet he comes over
and asks you to dance.

490
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,515
- I won't dance with no Yankee.
- I thought you was a loyal Union woman.

491
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,995
I am. My dead husband wasn't.

492
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:45,672
He'd be rollin' in his grave
if I was dancin' with some Yankee feller.

493
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,876
I knew it. Here he comes.

494
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,950
It ain't gonna do no good. I didn't come
here to meet up with Yankee strangers.

495
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:16,599
You look like the prettiest girl around.
I was wonderin' if you wanna dance.

496
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,472
Surely.

497
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,995
You comin' with me?

498
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,355
I just think you're lyin'.

499
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,519
I ain't lyin'. I'll take you
on up to Springfield.

500
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,314
You had your way,
and you want to again, and you'II...

501
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:07,309
I'll take you on up to Springfield,
and that kid of yours, too.

502
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:13,390
I bet you have your way with lots of girls.
Bet you tell 'em all a whole pack of lies.

503
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,029
I ain't lyin'.

504
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:21,517
But I would if I couldn't figure
no other way with you.

He has had many fights.

Howdy, Bill.

509
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:40,999
- Dave.
- What brings you back to these parts?

510
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:44,829
I spent the last six months scoutin'
for the army. Figured I'd come back here,

511
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,793
see the sights, see my old friends.

512
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:53,798
I hope you ain't figurin' on startin'
back up with Miss Susannah Moore.

513
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,038
Got tired of waitin' on you,
took up with somebody else.

Who'd that be, Dave?

515
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,075
That'd be me, Bill.

516
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,350
She took up with me.

00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,755

Where'd you get that watch?

521
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:44,790
Goddammit, how many times I told you
to stop botherin' me about things?

522
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,595
I recognise it. It's Bill's, ain't it?

523
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,957
His daddy gave him this watch.

524
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,435
You sure never took it off him.

525
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:59,678
Yeah? Well, I never said
I did that neither, did I?

526
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,075
Then how'd you get it?

527
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,236
Card game last night.

528
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:12,195
You walk around town wearin' this watch,
he'll kill you.

529
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,270
Say, pard.

530
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,233
You seen old Dave Tutt today?

531
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:38,636
I sure have.
He's right over across the way.

532
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:41,718
Tell me, friend, is he wearing my watch?

533
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,832
I really couldn't say.

534
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,112
Well...

535
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:06,631
By God, Bill, I'm glad to see
you could make it out today.

536
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,429
You know, this ain't about
no timepiece, Bill.

537
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,516
You know it...

538
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,350

539
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,916
He called it.

540
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,631
Whole damn thing didn't have to happen.

541
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:27,072
I come here for Wild Bill.
I don't want nobody interferin' none.

550
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,436
<i>(Jack)</i>
I've been thinkin' about you, Donnie.

551
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:09,076
I've been thinkin' a man has to seize
his opportunities where he finds them.

552
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,954
I tried last night,
but I fell short of my mark.

553
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:19,795
Now, you're a lot rougher feller than I am,
ain't you, Donnie?

554
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,151
You and your boys here are real capable.

555
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,759
And you've found your greatest
opportunity right here in Deadwood.

556
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,758
The most famous gunfighter
in all the world.

557
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:34,997
- He's gettin' old.
- He is for a fact.

558
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:40,717
But, uh, the sight of him in the street,
well, it could make a young feller shake.

559
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:44,719
He don't make me shake.
How much money are we talkin'?

560
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:47,991
You called it before, Donnie. $1,000.

561
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,876
Here she is.

562
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:58,633
$250 now, $250 when we meet tonight,
the other half when it's done.

563
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,915
Want it or not?

Maybe you can help me.

01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,513
Where the hell did things go wrong?

570
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,476
This kid,

571
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,433
Miss Jane, trouble with my eyes.

572
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:25,318
You don't understand a blessed word

<i>(imitates slurping)</i>

574

I had him. I had him
right there in front of me.

575
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:48,996
All I had to do was pull the trigger.

576
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,793
You ask yourself why you didn't?

577
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,517
I don't know.

578
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:58,713
Maybe I was enjoyin' the moment
too much, or... <i>(chuckles)</i>

579
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,354
...maybe I ain't got the nerve.

580
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:08,350
Tie the knot right there, would you? A bow
knot or something that'll slip real easy.

581
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:13,958
I guess this is fare thee well
between you and me.

582
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:18,517
Come tonight, I either
see him dead and be on the run...

583
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,517
or he'll kill me dead like all them others.

584
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:28,191
You've come this far.
That's already buckin' the odds.

585

Maybe you'll just go all the way.

01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,954
Bill!

589
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,913
It's surely good to see you. Uh-huh.

590
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:26,717
Where you been, Bill? I thought
maybe that kid scared you outta town.

591
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:30,719
Would you find that help of yours
and tell him to go across to Jensen's barn,

592
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:33,559
tell them to have a horse ready?
I'm headin' out come dawn.

593
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,717
Yes, sir. I'll take care of it myself.

01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,310
- D'you eat your supper?
- Wasn't hungry.

595
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,993
Now, that don't sound right to me.

596
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,796
Mm-mm.

597
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:10,279
You got to learn
to take better care of yourself.

598
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:18,191
Where the hell'd everybody go? There's
not a damn person out there in the street.

01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:23,110
There's a new gold strike 30 miles
west of here. Real gargantua.

Whole town rushed off this morning.

01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,476
You stayed?

602
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:33,196
Maybe I was worried about you, Bill.

603
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,276
Ain't damn likely.

604
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:47,911
Joe and Charley hung around too.
Nobody knew where you'd been holed up.

605
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:53,990
If you're lookin' for them,
they're upstairs sleepin' in the flop room.

606
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:01,438
Had me another bad dream
on the Chinese pipe.

607
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:06,190
- Things are comin' back to haunt me.
- I figured it was somethin' like that.

608
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:10,108
You got to stay away from that stuff.
Stick with whisky.

- Now, why do you think that is?
- I don't know precisely.

I always reckoned I knew you
better than them others.

You've been around lots.

656
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:09,869
too much whisky, no food.

657
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,753
I get easy. Don't know that I should.

658
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,030
Oh, hush now, Bill.

659
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:18,554
Don't fight it none.

660
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:23,231
<i>(player piano plays</i>
<i>"The Battle Hymn of the Republic")</i>

661
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,836
Love you, Bill.

662
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,108
Right now I love you too, Jane.

663
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:46,596
Maybe we'd just better get on with it, hm?

664
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:52,869
? And his truth goes marchin' on

665
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,318
Hey!

666
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,549
Move easy or I kill you both.
Now get off her!

667
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,800
You inconsiderate bastard.

668
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:22,349
Get those guns in a tote sack
and head upstairs, see who's there.

669
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:24,994
Let's do it. Let's shoot the son of a bitch.

670
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,156
I'm thinkin'.

671
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,510
Don't hurry me none.

672
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:33,800
- Excuse me whilst I pull up my pants!
- Upstairs.

673
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,992
Don't want no back of the head shot
like Mr Lincoln.

674
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:40,237
Give me that pocket gun
you keep in there.

675
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:56,951
Hey! Would you mind avertin' your eyes?
I'm a little exposed here.

676
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:58,832
Donnie!

677
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,270
Goddammit! A Negro.

678
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:11,635
Just a gun-sharp.
Don't mind my colour. I make a livin'.

679
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,069
You ungrateful son of a bitch.

680
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:18,796
I almost got my ass shot off 20 times
tryin' to free your type during the war!

681
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:21,593
That was mighty white of you, Wild Bill.

682
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,877
Bill! The horses'll be ready at...

683
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,558
Aw, shit.

684
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,156
Who the hell are you?

685
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,917
I don't think these are gentlemen
we should challenge, Joe.

686
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:48,876
They look a bit on the rough and
boorish side, possibly even dangerous.

687
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:10,829
What are we waitin' for?
Let's get this done.

688
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:14,509
I told you I wanted to think things through.

689
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:19,077
I kinda enjoy the great man
bein' captured like he is.

690
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:23,239
You lose your nerve?
We've been here long enough.

691
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:29,675
- Well, play cards.
- You reckon we're really gonna do this?

692
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:36,036
You deserted my ma
and left her unacknowledged.

693
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:39,675
Then you shot and killed the only man
that coulda made her happy.

694
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:43,349
Your ma always knowed
I might have to leave.

695
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:48,199
She enjoyed our little time together,
just like I did.

696
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:52,677
Then how come you promised
you were gonna be like a father to me?

697
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,759
That's a mighty evil thing
to tell a young widow.

698
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:01,596
Now, you see, Jack,
that's the way it is with men and women.

699
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:07,795
Lots of times, men make some promises,
then take their pleasures and move on.

700
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:11,799
- Jane, play cards.
- Now, on the other side of the ledger,

701
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:16,436
you ought to understand that when
a woman finally surrenders to a man,

702
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,519
she's usually got him
just about where she wants him.

703
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,677
I'd love to go do my toilette,
<i>s'il vous plat?</i>

704
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,756
Sit back down.

705
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:29,718
- Bill?
- You can sit a minute.

706
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,275
I do believe I will.

707
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,596
Count me in, boys.

708
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:45,077
What if I could persuade Wild Bill
to let you go?

709
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,709
Erase the shadow
that he has cast over you.

710
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,990
Apologise.

711
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,350
Go drown in crap, Charley.

712
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:02,635
I don't know why this matters to me,

713
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:05,399
except that I'd miss Bill's company.

714
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:09,718
But every time there is a death of a hero,
we are all the less.

715
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:13,799
It drags down morale. People get anxious,
depressed, drink more, fight more,

716
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,753
causing more killings,
till the general uncertainty

717
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:20,350
destroys whatever
useful or good remains.

718
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:26,794
Jack, with luck, and rough cunning,

719
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:30,276
you've got maybe 40 years
to rid yourself of Wild Bill

720
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,073
and learn the value of simple things.

721
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:38,797
Fall in love with some pretty girl
and learn to cultivate your talents.

722
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:42,390
Is this your college education
that makes you dribble on so?

723
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:45,034
Oh, come on, Bill.

724
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:47,515
You can let this kid go.

725
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:51,633
Apologise for wrongs, real and imagined?

726
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,228
Shake hands, have a drink?

727
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:58,751
You'll need all the friends you can get
when your eyes get worse.

728
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,836
I don't apologise.

729
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:06,910
See, he figures whatever he done,
even if it wasn't perfect, was justifiable.

730
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,589
Well, you see, Jack.

731
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:18,910
Even if Bill won't do anything but die
restless, trying the patience of his friends,

732
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,759
maybe you could let him go.

733
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,392
Forgive him.

734
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:27,080
And move on.

735
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:30,192
He's the one captured here.

736
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,520
Well... I've said my piece.

737
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,716
You rotten bastard!

738
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:43,555
OK, Charley. Come on.

739
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,629
Come on. I got you.

740
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:50,117
Charley had him
some mighty interesting cards here.

741
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,593
There you go. Come on, sugar.

742
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:59,073
Carl, give me a rag or somethin'.

743
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:09,711
There ain't even a Chinaman out there.

744
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:22,238
There isn't much change.
I expect she could see a visitor, though.

745
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:27,677
She has her screaming fits now and then,
but most times she's normal.

746
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,439
I knew her family down in Arkansas.

747
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:35,315
Her momma's from Yell County.
The boy's been boarded out.

748
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:38,352
He's roomin' up the road there
at the James place.

749
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:42,598
- Our women ain't very pretty, are they?
- They look mostly hungry.

750
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:48,078
Probably are. The state's had us
on mush and molasses for months.

751
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,674
You shouldn't have come.

752
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:18,431
You got nothin' to be ashamed about.
The woman, she says you're normal.

753
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:23,918
That's what she says. Normal.
You act right, they'll let you out.

754
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:29,317
- I'll make 'em do it.
- No. I'll get outta here.

755
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,715
Don't you worry about that.

756
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:36,198
I just went through a bad time is all.

757
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,839
Lost my husband,

758
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,599
lost you, lost Dave.

759
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:44,870
You come into my life...

760
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:51,790
I thought you was the dashin' stranger
that was gonna change everything,

761
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,475
make it all fine.

762
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:59,194
And you did.

763
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:02,471
It was all real fine for a while.

764
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:05,273
The best I ever knew, about.

765
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:11,236
I even thought you was gonna be
a real good daddy to my son.

766
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,600
But then you went off, and...

767
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,190
when you come back,

768
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:23,789
it was gone. The special feeling was gone.

769
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,956
Go on your way.

770
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:34,510
I got my boy.

771
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,995
He'll take care of me.

772
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:45,190
I'll get outta here, and he'll take care
of me, and I'll take care of him.

773
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,555
Go on your way now, Bill.

774
01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:00,679
You gonna do it?
You gonna shoot Wild Bill?

775
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,109
I just gotta get the time right in my head.

776
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:05,470
If you're gonna finish Bill, just get to it.

777
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:10,913
I killed two men in my life.
I never made no goddamn circus out of it!

778
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,951
I didn't know no ladies killed.

779
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:16,152
I was defendin' myself
against unnatural advances.

780
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:20,034
Well, pard, looks like you've come
to a messy end, no size to it.

781
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:25,553
Don't seem right for the great Wild Bill,
but it don't seem like nothin' can be done.

782
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:28,797
So I figure, Jack, since
all this makes no difference to Bill,

783
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:31,150
kill him quick and don't apologise.

784
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,840
You're gonna go to hell, Joe.

785
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:39,637
It'd be a kindness to have your company,
but I'm just tryin' to get it over with.

786
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,876
Kill him.

787
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,468
Make sure you do it clean.
Don't prolong it.

788
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,239
Just kill him! Let's get it done.

789
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,990
Everybody says kill you.

790
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:58,996
Ain't their concern. It's yours and mine.

791
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:02,520
Now, listen.
I have here one hell of an idea.

792
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,552
You just give me the pistol,
one hard slug in her,

793
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:08,240
I'll blow my own damn brains out,
save you the trouble!

794
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:11,670
Yes, let him kill himself.
He's been doing it all his life.

795
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,358
Give me the gun!

796
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:34,276
I left one slug in there. I'm gonna
stand back so you can fire when ready.

797
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:46,240
You wanna say goodbye?

798
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:50,672
Sure.

799
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:55,673
Goodbye, Jack.

800
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,433
I got you that time, Wild Bill.

801
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,355
Now this is it.

802
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:35,392
I can't.

803
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,754
For Christ's sake!

804
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:43,590
I couldn't do it last night in the
Chinese flophouse, and I can't do it now.

805
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:46,075
Cos I done it already.

806
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:49,317
Like the Bible says, I done it in my heart.

807
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,795
I killed you already.

808
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,309
How about I do it?

809
01:20:56,440 --> 01:21:00,638
The man who kills Wild Bill
will be very famous.

810
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:03,638
Especially when he hangs for it.

811
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:07,275
Could you just jump over the bullshit?

812
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:17,435
Let's get outta here.

813
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,520
Be seein' you around, Wild Bill.

814
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:31,235
Maybe next time I won't be workin'
for no chickenshit kid.

815
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:41,758
Come on, let's go.

816
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:44,314
Well, at last I can do my toilette.

817
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:08,390
We got your guns! Anybody come outside
before we're gone, there will be a killin'!

818
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,192
Bill!

819
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:33,269
You all best stay in here.

820
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:36,039
Gimme one of them Colts, Bill.

821
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:41,712
Can't do it, Joe. I'm a better pistol shot
than you with either hand.

822
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,116
How are the eyes, Bill?

823
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:50,509
Never can tell, Charley.
It comes and goes.

824
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:06,318
<i>The theatre of Bill's life</i>
<i>had come to demand</i>

825
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:09,159
<i>that he walk up</i>
<i>the centre of a muddy street</i>

826
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,840
<i>rather than use the boardwalk.</i>

827
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:18,871
<i>He had discovered being Wild Bill</i>
<i>was a profession in its own right.</i>

828
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,991
<i>(horses fretting)</i>

829
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:30,671
You oughta know better
than to touch another man's hat.

830
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,518
Get him!

831
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:23,674
Come here, Jack.

832
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,913
Give me my pocket gun back.

833
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:40,716
I'm lettin' you live.

834
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:46,392
A sentimental gesture in honour
of your mother. Now get on outta here.

835
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:49,398
Thank you, Mr Hickok, sir.

836
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:50,714
Uh...

837
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:53,991
Mind if I have me a drink afore I leave?

838
01:24:55,360 --> 01:25:01,310
I'll buy you one. Whisky's good for a man.
Helps you see things in perspective.

839
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:07,674
<i>(Joe)</i> Whisky and cards.
The Lord does provide.

840
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:09,279
Ohh!

841
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,994
I've been up here 20 minutes
cryin' my eyes out,

842
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:15,396
and none of you bastards would come up
and tell me what happened!

843
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,718
- Bill killed 'em, killed 'em all.
- I don't expect decent treatment from Bill,

844
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:23,879
but I figured a gent like Charley
would come upstairs and tell a lady!

845
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,357
I knew if I told you that Bill was alive,
you'd be mad at him again.

846
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:33,110
- What's he doin' here?
- <i>(Joe)</i> Bill's buyin' him a drink.

847
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:38,192
Go on there and drink your drink
and then head on outta town!

848
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,675
Else I'll be the one to put a bullet in ya!

849
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,189
Yes, ma'am.

850
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:48,075
You ain't no kinda man at all.
You're just some kinda fool.

851
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,560
This whole thing's
been too damn crazy, Bill!

852
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:56,798
You've always been able to do
whatever you want, and we don't matter!

853
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,831
- None of us! Ever!
- Hush up now.

854
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,350
I'm concentratin' on my cards.
I like this view over here better, boys.

855
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:05,916
And I'm gonna like you a whole lot better
when you've passed on!

856
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:12,275
That way I can just say I loved you
and I don't have to explain it none! <i>(sobs)</i>

857
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,755
Come on, deal 'em up, Joe.
My luck's runnin'.

858
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:17,633
You remember them soldiers
in Hays City, Bill?

859
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:21,196
<i>(Charley)</i> He remembers every fight
he was ever in. He loves them all.

860
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:24,790
<i>(Bill)</i> Goddamn soldiers!
Never liked them, any of them.

861
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:29,198
Never liked bein' one, neither.
Wasn't cut out for the army life.

862
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:31,515
Never liked eastern bastards, neither.

863
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:35,315
One time Bill says to his deputy,
Mike Williams, he says...

864
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:40,719
This is in Abilene. Bill says "I don't want
you mixin' in this, cos this is my affair."

865
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:46,198
"It's just between me and this feller
Phil Coe, who stole my watch."

866
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,595
Dave Tutt stole my watch.

867
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:54,272
Then Bill waded into this mob of drunks,
sharps, whores, mental deficients,

868
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:57,676
all of 'em friends
of the great Texas gunfighter, Phil...

869
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:02,590
Phil Coe. Another one of them bullshit
Texans. Never much liked any of 'em.

870
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:05,871
Mean sons of bitches, usually
cheat at cards, never take a bath.

871
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,356
Bill says "Phil Coe, I'm arrestin' you,

872
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,948
because you went
and committed a murder."

873
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:15,789
All of a sudden Phil Coe pulls a drop
on Bill, who was too quick for him

874
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:20,277
and gunned him down with two shots,
the second one breakin' his spine.

875
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,994
He deserved it.
And that ain't the way it happened.

876
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,588
Then Bill heard footsteps
runnin' behind him.

877
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:30,669
He turns and fires, and accidentally
kills his own deputy, Mike Williams.

878
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,951
Then he tells the crowd
to clear the streets - which they done -

879
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:37,072
and he stands there
and cries over the body.

880
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:41,113
Nothin' like that ever happened.
It was windy. The dust got in my eyes.

881
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:44,277
Then there was the time
Bill fought them soldiers in Hays City.

882
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:47,517
A whole platoon of bluecoats
from the 7th Cavalry took him on

883
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:50,473
over a chance remark
about a woman Bill was seein'.

884
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:54,115
Bill's great fights always
involved a woman one way or another.

885
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:58,358
It was the only time the great Wild Bill
took off his guns.

886
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:01,438
Them soldiers damn near killed him
with their fists and boots.

887
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:04,199
Only the miracle of the bartender,
one Tommy Drum,

888
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:08,108
who gave Bill back his firearms,
saved the day.

889
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:09,992
Sendin' you home, Wild Bill.

890
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:12,472
No!

891
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:23,350
<i>Jack McCall was hanged March 1 st, 1877,</i>

892
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:28,235
<i>for the murder of James Butler Hickok,</i>
<i>known as Wild Bill.</i>

893
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:31,555
<i>Like a city in the Old Testament,</i>

894
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:36,800
<i>Deadwood had become</i>
<i>a place of prophecy and visions.</i>

895
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,753
<i>Bill was 39 years old when he died.</i>

896
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:44,149
<i>I'm proud to say I was his friend.</i>

897
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:48,200
? <i>What a fellowship</i>

898
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:51,878
? <i>What a joy divine</i>

899
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:57,468
? <i>Leaning on the everlasting arms</i>

900
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:00,952
? <i>What a blessed peace</i>

901
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:04,152
? <i>What a joy is mine</i>

902
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:09,749
? <i>Leaning on the everlasting arms</i>

903
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:13,113
? <i>Leaning on Jesus</i>

904
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:16,989
? <i>Leaning on Jesus</i>

905
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:23,195
? <i>Safe and secure from all alarm</i>

906
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:26,518
? <i>Leaning on Jesus</i>

907
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:30,036
? <i>Leaning on Jesus</i>

908
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:35,952
