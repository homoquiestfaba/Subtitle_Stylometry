1
00:01:52,726 --> 00:01:55,490
Brian and Tonya Digs.

2
00:01:56,696 --> 00:01:59,028
Okay, it says here
you both feel

3
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:02,762
that your lives are
monotonous, unfulfilled,

4
00:02:02,836 --> 00:02:08,365
sometimes humiliating
and straight out boring.

5
00:02:08,442 --> 00:02:10,342
Guys,

6
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,313
these problems started
long before your marriage.

7
00:02:15,382 --> 00:02:18,283
You've been like this
your whole lives.

8
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:21,286
So now you've sought
out my expertise

9
00:02:21,354 --> 00:02:23,618
because you want to
make some changes, yes?

10
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:29,026
I n your marriage and
your lives, yes? Alright.

11
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:31,393
Question number
one here.

12
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:34,594
Do you love
each other?

13
00:02:40,273 --> 00:02:46,269
Yes. When was the last time
you had any... fun... together?

14
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:57,350
When was the last time the
two of you did "that thing?"

15
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:00,156
"That thing?"

16
00:03:00,227 --> 00:03:01,194
Fucked.

17
00:03:03,797 --> 00:03:06,027
Yeah, that's
what I thought.

18
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:10,035
That's a damn shame.
Okay. Listen, uhm,

19
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:14,733
I'm gonna give you guys
a homework assignment.

20
00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:17,572
Between now and
our next session,

21
00:03:17,644 --> 00:03:23,708
I want you two to have
found something... fun.

22
00:03:23,783 --> 00:03:26,843
To do.
Together.

23
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,892
Alrighty, then.

24
00:03:37,964 --> 00:03:39,022
Yeah.

25
00:03:44,304 --> 00:03:46,670
<i>* What a waste agaln *</i>

<i>* We about to do

35
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:29,510
What do you call
a dog with no legs?

36
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:32,912
It doesn't matter
what you call him.

37
00:04:32,986 --> 00:04:35,580
He's not comin'!

38
00:04:40,393 --> 00:04:42,156
Here's another one.

39
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:46,096
What did one casket
say to the other casket?

40
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:50,462
Is that you "coffin?"

41
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,560
Digs, why haven't you authorized
payment on the Pettigrew account?

42
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:55,590
But... but M r. Haney, y...
you told me not to authorize it.

43
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:57,000
I never said that.

44
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,868
Yes you did, M r. Haney.
J... J ust yesterday.

45
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:07,443
Are you calling
me a liar, Digs?

46
00:06:07,514 --> 00:06:09,414
Oh, n... n... no, sir,
M r. Haney...

47
00:06:09,482 --> 00:06:11,882
Digs, if there's
one thing I hate,

48
00:06:11,951 --> 00:06:14,545
it's an employee
who passes the buck.

49
00:06:14,621 --> 00:06:18,022
You are skating on what I
like to call very thin ice.

50
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:19,581
Look at it!

51
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:22,526
If you happen to fall
through that very thin ice,

52
00:06:22,595 --> 00:06:24,222
you are gonna
drown, comprende?

53
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:26,595
Yes, sir,
M r. Haney!

54
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,226
So, with that
having been said,

55
00:06:29,302 --> 00:06:33,261
wipe that stupid look
off your face. Wipe it!

56
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:37,776
Get out of my office
and get back to work!

57
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,810
O K, I'm so sorry
we're late, M rs. Digs.

58
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:48,217
I got held up
at the shop-in

59
00:06:48,288 --> 00:06:50,279
and my boyfriend Tyrone
had to bring me.

60
00:06:50,356 --> 00:06:52,790
Hey, baby! You ready to go? Oome on.

61
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:56,420
Alright, well, say
goodnight to M rs. Digs.

62
00:06:56,496 --> 00:06:59,124
<i>Alrlght. Here we go. Oh, sorry.</i>

63
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,429
<i>He better not get
no dlrt In my car.</i>

64
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:03,765
He ain't, Tyrone.
Damn.

65
00:07:03,837 --> 00:07:06,397
<i>Alrlght. Say
goodnlght. Bye.</i>

66
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:20,408
H mm.

67
00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:23,817
U h, honey?

68
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:29,760
I was thinking, uhm, maybe we
could catch a movie or something.

69
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:32,024
Oh! What's playing?

70
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:34,498
I don't know.

71
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:39,834
U hm, oh, I did hear
about that one starnet guy

72
00:07:39,906 --> 00:07:43,137
w... with that other guy

73
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:47,646
and they, uh, they...
they go to that place,

74
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:52,742
and they, uh... and they
do that... that... thing.

75
00:07:58,258 --> 00:08:00,055
Ha.

76
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:06,256
Maybe we should take a
romantic walk along the lake.

77
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:08,300
Although it does get
kind of dangerous

78
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:10,063
down there
around this time.

79
00:08:10,136 --> 00:08:14,095
I saw on the news, some lady got
jumped in by a gang down there.

80
00:08:14,174 --> 00:08:15,163
H m.

81
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:19,803
Maybe we should just stay home.

82
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,177
Yeah.
Yeah.

83
00:08:41,534 --> 00:08:44,833
Boy, you fall for that one every time.

84
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:49,575
Evening, Brian.

85
00:08:51,511 --> 00:08:54,810
Hello, Otis.
Hello, Amber.

86
00:08:54,881 --> 00:08:56,849
Oome on in.

87
00:09:10,363 --> 00:09:11,557
M m.

88
00:09:16,536 --> 00:09:18,697
So I told the
motherfucker several times,

89
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:22,764
I said, "Motherfucker, keep your
dog from shittin' in my yard. "

90
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:24,537
That's what
you tell him.

91
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:26,704
But he wouldn't listen.
Would he, babe?

92
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:30,078
U h-uh. So I taught him a lesson.

93
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:32,777
I went out to his yard,
pulled my pants down,

94
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:36,253
took a shit
in his yard!

95
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:37,949
Took a shit
in his yard!

96
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:51,226
Anyway, Brian,
me and you...

97
00:09:51,304 --> 00:09:53,397
Need to talk
man-to-man shit.

98
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:56,433
Now, Brian.

99
00:09:56,509 --> 00:09:59,137
Oh, uh, yeah.
Excuse us, ladies.

100
00:10:05,618 --> 00:10:08,519
Otis loves having
Brian as a neighbor.

101
00:10:08,588 --> 00:10:12,251
I think he sees him as
the brother he never had.

102
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:15,158
Yeah. I see what you mean.

103
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:20,321
Tonya, remember I told you
I was gonna see that psychic

104
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,597
about those crazy
dreams I was having?

105
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:28,937
Well, she told me
that those dreams

106
00:10:29,008 --> 00:10:33,707
were a manifestation of my
own latent psychic abilities.

107
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:39,012
She said I have
the gift, Tonya.

108
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:40,985
No!

109
00:10:41,054 --> 00:10:43,579
M m-hm.

110
00:10:43,656 --> 00:10:45,283
Let me read
your palm.

111
00:10:48,761 --> 00:10:50,752
You know I wouldn't even ask you this

112
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,390
unless I really
needed it, Brian.

113
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:55,331
Oan you lend a brother a few dollars?

114
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:59,770
O... Otis, uh, you're my
neighbor and I like you.

115
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,104
A lot. But you never
paid me that 200

116
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:05,110
that I loaned you
two weeks ago

117
00:11:05,178 --> 00:11:08,306
or that 300
from last month.

118
00:11:08,381 --> 00:11:11,077
I ain't dissin',
bitch! See?

119
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,879
I come over here
in a time of need,

120
00:11:12,952 --> 00:11:15,785
and you go come bringin'
up some ol' shit? H uh?

121
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:17,550
After all I do
around here,

122
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:19,853
come around here
socializing and shit?

123
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:23,225
Oomin' over here spreadin' my
knowledge, logic, and worldly wisdom

124
00:11:23,296 --> 00:11:25,355
on your square ass? And
you wanna do this to me?

125
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:27,456
You know what?
Fuck you, Brian!

126
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:29,865
Fuck you with a big square dick!

127
00:11:29,936 --> 00:11:34,032
Alright, alright. U hm, here's
at least 40 bucks. All I have.

128
00:11:34,107 --> 00:11:35,335
Forty bucks?

129
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:37,535
Let me
have that.

130
00:11:39,712 --> 00:11:42,146
What?
That's 42.

131
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:45,150
Now, see, that's what being
a good neighbor all about.

132
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:49,848
Being a neighbor is good food and money.

133
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:51,719
And you know what?
I'm gonna get this

134
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,486
back to you by the end of the week.

135
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,254
You understand me?
We a team!

136
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:57,523
You down
with Otis.

137
00:11:57,597 --> 00:11:58,564
You down
with Otis?

138
00:11:58,631 --> 00:11:59,996
Say " I'm down
with Otis. "

139
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:01,499
I'm... I'm... I'm
down with Otis.

140
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:03,194
Say it like you
mean it.

141
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:05,237
I'm down
with Otis.

142
00:12:05,304 --> 00:12:09,263
You alright.
You alright.

143
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:13,008
You want
some chicken?

144
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:21,412
Oh.
Tonya! Sweety!

145
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:23,546
According to your palm,
you haven't been

146
00:12:23,623 --> 00:12:25,716
a happy woman
for a very long time.

147
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,154
Oh, and day after day after day,

148
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:34,290
you have to put on the happy
facade for the little kiddies.

149
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:35,629
And all the time,
you're in need

150
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:37,134
of a little
stimulation yourself.

151
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:44,539
Oh. So how's the therapy
going for you and Brian?

152
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,703
How'd you know we were
seeing a therapist?

153
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:49,373
It's all here,
plain as day.

154
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:52,282
Oh. Oh.

155
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,784
Don't you
worry, Tonya.

156
00:12:53,853 --> 00:12:55,753
You and Brian
are gonna find

157
00:12:55,822 --> 00:12:57,881
that "something"
you both enjoy.

158
00:13:12,004 --> 00:13:13,904
I'm telling you,
Brian, she saw things

159
00:13:13,973 --> 00:13:15,463
that no one
could have known.

160
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,669
I believe in that
palm-reading stuff

161
00:13:18,744 --> 00:13:21,144
as much as I believe
in Santa Olaus.

162
00:13:21,214 --> 00:13:23,341
Well, you believed
in Santa Olaus

163
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,475
up until your junior
year in high school.

164
00:13:25,551 --> 00:13:28,850
The point is, I don't
believe in it now, okay?

165
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:31,617
All that psychic doodle crap is a scam.

166
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:33,090
Now, I like Amber.

167
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:36,151
But she's a little
on the eccentric side.

168
00:13:36,229 --> 00:13:38,993
H m. What
about Otis?

169
00:13:40,466 --> 00:13:41,660
Good night, honey.

170
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:50,038
Good night.

171
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:03,515
<i>Come on, man,
hlt that dlce.</i>

172
00:14:08,461 --> 00:14:10,486
Yo, fellas,

173
00:14:10,563 --> 00:14:13,691
check out
LeMarc coming.

174
00:14:24,377 --> 00:14:25,776
Boo!

175
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:51,297
' N ight, M r. Haney.

176
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,362
Digs, you finish
that Whitemore account?

177
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,500
You said you wanted it
on Thursday, M r. Haney.

178
00:14:57,577 --> 00:14:59,169
I changed my mind,
I want it tomorrow.

179
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,910
M r. Haney, I was
just headed home.

180
00:15:02,982 --> 00:15:05,348
I already put in
three extra hours.

181
00:15:07,086 --> 00:15:08,951
You ever been down
to Skid Row, Digs?

182
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:14,919
I've driven past
it a few times.

183
00:15:14,994 --> 00:15:18,191
It's a damn shame the way
those people live down there.

184
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:22,633
Amongst all the filth,
and scum, and shit!

185
00:15:22,702 --> 00:15:25,899
A lot of those poor
bastards once had a good job.

186
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:27,769
J ust like you.

187
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,900
But they kept pissin'
off their bosses,

188
00:15:30,977 --> 00:15:33,775
<i>just llke you.</i>

189
00:15:33,846 --> 00:15:36,371
And if you're not
very careful, Digs,

190
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:40,215
you're gonna find yourself setting
up a cardboard box down there,

191
00:15:40,286 --> 00:15:42,277
<i>just llke them.</i>

192
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:44,186
Y'understand?

193
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:46,955
Thank you.

194
00:15:47,026 --> 00:15:48,653
Thank you!

195
00:15:48,728 --> 00:15:49,820
<i>Thank you I I</i>

196
00:16:38,577 --> 00:16:39,839
Aw, it's just
a bumper.

197
00:16:39,912 --> 00:16:41,812
You did me a favor, I needed to wake up.

198
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:44,213
Why the fuck did you
stop like a fucking pussy?

199
00:16:44,283 --> 00:16:45,341
Excuse me?

200
00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:47,147
You heard
me, bitch.

201
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:48,709
Let's forget
the whole thing.

202
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:49,880
Where you
goin', huh?

203
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,349
I don't want trouble,
it's been a long day...

204
00:16:53,426 --> 00:16:55,451
I don't wanna hear
your fucking life story.

205
00:16:55,528 --> 00:16:57,428
I don't want trouble,
I'm trying to get home.

206
00:16:57,496 --> 00:17:00,590
Yeah? What are you
gonna do about it?

207
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,224
Please, don't
do that.

208
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:04,997
Why, bitch? What are you gonna do?

209
00:17:05,071 --> 00:17:06,902
Oh, you got
a fucking problem?

210
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:11,235
I told you I didn't
want any trouble.

211
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,540
I tell you I was
trying to get home.

212
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,550
Honey?

213
00:17:57,623 --> 00:17:59,420
M m.
Yeah?

214
00:17:59,492 --> 00:18:01,323
I, uh,

215
00:18:01,394 --> 00:18:03,760
I had a little
accident tonight.

216
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:07,595
You did?
What happened?

217
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:15,538
Well, I was driving along
and I came to a stop sign

218
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:19,806
and this guy, he, uh,
he bumped from behind.

219
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:21,847
Are you and
the car O K?

220
00:18:21,914 --> 00:18:23,677
Everything's fine.

221
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:25,478
Oh. O K.

222
00:18:28,487 --> 00:18:30,455
Kinda.

223
00:18:30,523 --> 00:18:32,923
Kinda? What do
you mean "kinda?"

224
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:36,484
Well, I "kinda" got into
a little altercation.

225
00:18:36,562 --> 00:18:39,588
Altercation, Brian,
did you have a fight?

226
00:18:39,665 --> 00:18:41,963
If you want
to call it that.

227
00:18:42,835 --> 00:18:43,893
I killed him.

228
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:45,402
What do you
mean "killed him?"

229
00:18:45,471 --> 00:18:50,841
I mean like he's dead. And I did it.

230
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,378
I just... I just sort
of snapped, honey,

231
00:18:53,446 --> 00:18:55,471
I... I choked him
to death!

232
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:58,244
Brian, what are
we gonna do?

233
00:18:58,317 --> 00:19:00,649
Well, I left as soon
as it happened

234
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:03,745
and I don't think anybody
saw me or anything.

235
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:07,224
Do you think we should call the Police?

236
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:10,057
Honey, if we
call the Police,

237
00:19:10,129 --> 00:19:12,825
I'm going to
jail for... ever!

238
00:19:12,898 --> 00:19:15,264
Maybe if we just
don't talk about it,

239
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:16,892
<i>It'll all
blow over.</i>

240
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:20,268
<i>Oh, don't cry, honey.
D... D... Don't cry.</i>

241
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:22,500
Everything's gonna
be fine, O K?

242
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:24,941
As a matter of fact,
just go back to sleep

243
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:28,275
and act like I never
told you. O K?

244
00:19:28,347 --> 00:19:31,476
O K.

245
00:19:34,186 --> 00:19:35,653
I'll try.

246
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:52,498
Yo, fellas. Here come LeMarc again.

247
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:57,099
Boldness is back.

248
00:19:57,176 --> 00:20:00,009
Little big-ass
mustache.

249
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,876
Look here, man.

250
00:20:01,947 --> 00:20:05,383
If you walkin' through here, you
gonna have to pay a toll or something.

251
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:20,627
We gotta leave
this guy alone, dog.

252
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:23,964
Hey man, you can walk right on
through. Sorry for the inconvenience.

253
00:20:24,036 --> 00:20:25,401
Excuse us, man.

254
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,872
You been to karate
school or something?

255
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:31,000
God bless
you, brother.

256
00:20:31,076 --> 00:20:33,101
I'm telling
you, honey,

257
00:20:33,178 --> 00:20:37,114
as crazy as it sounds,
I feel like a new man.

258
00:20:37,182 --> 00:20:40,379
For the first time in
my life, I feel strong.

259
00:20:40,452 --> 00:20:41,919
Ever since
I killed that guy.

260
00:20:41,987 --> 00:20:42,919
But Brian!

261
00:20:42,988 --> 00:20:44,717
It's the truth!

262
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:48,351
I feel like I've experienced
some type of transformation.

263
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:50,258
It's... it's liberating.

264
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:52,194
It's crazy.

265
00:20:52,264 --> 00:20:55,358
I agree. But maybe crazy isn't
as bad as we always thought.

266
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:59,268
Brian, you just can't
go around killing people.

267
00:20:59,338 --> 00:21:00,771
Why not?

268
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:03,205
Because it's wrong!

269
00:21:03,275 --> 00:21:04,936
Says who?

270
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:08,605
If I kill a burglar or an enemy
of the country, is that wrong?

271
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:11,479
Honey, maybe it's time
we start questioning

272
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,108
everything we've
been taught.

273
00:21:13,185 --> 00:21:15,312
I feel like I've been
brainwashed my whole life!

274
00:21:15,387 --> 00:21:18,788
Always told to do the
so-called "right thing. "

275
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:20,950
Walk in a single file
line. Do your homework.

276
00:21:21,026 --> 00:21:23,460
Eat your vegetables.
Get a degree.

277
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:25,497
Get a job.
Follow the rules.

278
00:21:25,564 --> 00:21:27,691
Don't cause problems.
Don't be an inconvenience.

279
00:21:27,766 --> 00:21:30,963
I'm tellin' you, honey, I'm
not the man I used to be.

280
00:21:40,846 --> 00:21:44,179
Boy, you want to buy a
second one in the jaw.

281
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:47,150
Whatch'all got to eat?

282
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:48,208
Dog.

283
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,365
Oh, yeah.

284
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:12,037
I don't like
the sonuvabitch nohow.

285
00:22:12,111 --> 00:22:15,603
I should've bust the crack in
his ass on general principle.

286
00:22:15,681 --> 00:22:18,206
<i>You see, I'm the type of person</i>

287
00:22:18,283 --> 00:22:21,309
that I tell somebody what
I think to their face.

288
00:22:21,387 --> 00:22:22,945
<i>Do y'understand?</i>

289
00:22:23,022 --> 00:22:25,320
M m. Honey,

290
00:22:25,391 --> 00:22:27,723
you make this macaroni
and cheese yourself?

291
00:22:27,793 --> 00:22:29,852
Why... why,
yes I did, Otis.

292
00:22:29,928 --> 00:22:30,826
<i>M m.</i>

293
00:22:30,896 --> 00:22:32,386
It tastes
like shit.

294
00:22:32,464 --> 00:22:35,194
Too bland. Needs some sugar in it.

295
00:22:35,267 --> 00:22:36,598
I tell Amber
all the time,

296
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:38,569
"When you make
macaroni and cheese,

297
00:22:38,637 --> 00:22:41,128
<i>put a llttle sugar
In It. " Thls here,</i>

298
00:22:41,206 --> 00:22:43,197
this ain't really
macaroni and cheese.

299
00:22:43,275 --> 00:22:45,209
This shit cheese.
Oh, yeah.

300
00:22:45,277 --> 00:22:46,676
<i>Blg ol' plle
of shlt.</i>

301
00:22:46,745 --> 00:22:49,680
O K. Well, uhm, I better
get to those dishes.

302
00:22:49,748 --> 00:22:51,306
Excuse me.

303
00:22:51,383 --> 00:22:52,907
<i>H m.</i>

304
00:22:54,486 --> 00:22:56,044
Not bad, Brian.

305
00:22:56,121 --> 00:22:58,555
Not bad at all.

306
00:22:58,624 --> 00:23:00,524
But I can tell by the way she walks,

307
00:23:00,592 --> 00:23:02,457
you ain't hittin'
that right.

308
00:23:02,528 --> 00:23:05,156
You ain't hittin'
that right.

309
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:07,565
By the way,

310
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:09,658
I ain't giving you back
that money no time soon.

311
00:23:09,735 --> 00:23:13,034
Mess around,
got a boot on my car.

312
00:23:13,105 --> 00:23:15,505
And I know I just let the
fucker just sit out there,

313
00:23:15,574 --> 00:23:19,032
but it gonna work out, dog. So...

314
00:23:19,111 --> 00:23:22,444
I'm ready to hold a few more
dollars, man. To get that boot off.

315
00:23:25,384 --> 00:23:27,852
Do me
a favor, Otis.

316
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,217
Wait right here.

317
00:23:51,176 --> 00:23:52,143
Otis.

318
00:23:54,113 --> 00:23:58,072
You've had this coming for a long time.

319
00:24:10,796 --> 00:24:13,629
You must not know
who you fuckin' with!

320
00:24:22,975 --> 00:24:24,499
Thanks, honey.

321
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,976
I didn't hurt
him, did I?

322
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:33,441
You didn't
hurt him.

323
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,412
You killed him.

324
00:24:38,624 --> 00:24:41,593
I killed him? W... W... What
do you mean I killed him?

325
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,127
<i>I mean,
I'm golng to jall?</i>

326
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:44,662
<i>Oh my God I
I'm golng to jall I</i>

327
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:48,632
Honey, we have
to keep our heads!

328
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,103
Yeah, you killed him but you
saved my life in the process.

329
00:24:53,172 --> 00:24:56,835
I'm proud of you. Now we just have to...

330
00:24:56,909 --> 00:24:58,934
get rid of
the body.

331
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:02,105
How?

332
00:25:16,662 --> 00:25:19,563
I think you better wait outside, honey.

333
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:03,334
M ission accomplished.

334
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:06,496
I don't think killing
somebody is an accomplishment

335
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:08,937
we should be
proud of, Brian.

336
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:12,204
Especially friends
of ours.

337
00:27:12,277 --> 00:27:14,871
Honey, Otis was never a friend.

338
00:27:14,947 --> 00:27:17,916
You hated him as much as I did.

339
00:27:17,983 --> 00:27:19,780
What about Amber?

340
00:27:19,851 --> 00:27:21,910
Honey, we did
Amber a favor!

341
00:27:21,987 --> 00:27:24,387
Do you imagine what
it must have been like

342
00:27:24,456 --> 00:27:26,515
to live
with that prick?

343
00:27:29,227 --> 00:27:30,888
I have to admit,

344
00:27:30,963 --> 00:27:32,988
as shameful
as it sounds,

345
00:27:33,065 --> 00:27:35,693
I found the
whole thing...

346
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:37,166
exhilarating.

347
00:27:38,503 --> 00:27:40,698
Exhilarating is
good. I mean...

348
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:43,764
shouldn't we do things
we find exhilarating?

349
00:27:43,842 --> 00:27:45,673
J ust like the
therapist said,

350
00:27:45,744 --> 00:27:48,838
do things that we find fun. Together.

351
00:27:48,914 --> 00:27:52,042
Brian, we just can't go
around killing innocent people.

352
00:27:54,619 --> 00:27:56,314
Tell you what.

353
00:27:56,388 --> 00:27:59,357
We'll only kill people who deserve it.

354
00:27:59,424 --> 00:28:01,688
People like...
like Otis.

355
00:28:04,329 --> 00:28:06,194
This is crazy.

356
00:28:06,264 --> 00:28:08,562
I can't believe we're
talking about this.

357
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:13,434
I mean, I've never felt
like this before, so...

358
00:28:13,505 --> 00:28:16,997
alive! And I
have to admit...

359
00:28:17,075 --> 00:28:18,440
What, honey?

360
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,705
I can't help but notice a change in you.

361
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:24,340
A new-found poise,

362
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:26,907
confidence,

363
00:28:26,985 --> 00:28:28,976
Oh... oh yeah?

364
00:28:29,054 --> 00:28:31,079
Absolutely.

365
00:28:31,156 --> 00:28:34,319
So... dominant.

366
00:28:34,393 --> 00:28:37,692
So... alpha male!

367
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:42,991
I think...
I think it's sexy.

368
00:28:43,068 --> 00:28:45,866
Sexy?
Yeah?

369
00:28:45,937 --> 00:28:47,632
Yeah, I do.

370
00:28:57,516 --> 00:29:00,952
<i>Take mel
You flnel</i>

371
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:02,418
<i>Oh I</i>

372
00:29:02,487 --> 00:29:05,251
O K! Oh, yeah! I got it!

373
00:29:13,365 --> 00:29:17,597
<i>O K, baby I
O KI</i>

374
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:21,230
<i>O KI O KI</i>

375
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,112
I don't care how overwhelmed
you think you are.

376
00:29:31,716 --> 00:29:33,809
If I don't hear from you
by the end of this evening,

377
00:29:33,885 --> 00:29:35,716
you'll be overwhelmed
with unemployment!

378
00:29:35,787 --> 00:29:40,315
What the hell are you
doing in my office?

379
00:29:40,392 --> 00:29:42,622
Well, M r. Haney,

380
00:29:42,694 --> 00:29:44,787
I figured it was time
we had a little talk.

381
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:48,391
And since I'm always
here so late anyway,

382
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:49,934
why not tonight?

383
00:29:50,001 --> 00:29:52,595
Have you lost
your mind?

384
00:29:54,806 --> 00:29:57,138
Maybe.

385
00:29:57,209 --> 00:30:00,406
I wanted to talk to you
about your people skills.

386
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:01,776
They're terrible.

387
00:30:03,715 --> 00:30:06,240
You see,
M r. Haney,

388
00:30:06,318 --> 00:30:09,151
when you're in
a position of power,

389
00:30:09,221 --> 00:30:11,746
you're responsible for
treating those under you

390
00:30:11,823 --> 00:30:16,021
with, at the very least...
a little common decency.

391
00:30:17,762 --> 00:30:19,525
<i>I've trled to be a good employee to you,</i>

392
00:30:19,598 --> 00:30:22,362
but you wouldn't
let me.

393
00:30:22,434 --> 00:30:25,062
<i>Not only dld you move up deadllnes,</i>

394
00:30:25,137 --> 00:30:28,629
but you've sabotaged every
account I've worked on.

395
00:30:28,707 --> 00:30:31,107
More than that,
you've denied me

396
00:30:31,176 --> 00:30:37,911
the common respect and decency
that everybody deserves.

397
00:30:37,983 --> 00:30:40,543
First off,
you're fired.

398
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:43,884
<i>Not only are you flred,
you are very fucklng flred.</i>

399
00:30:43,955 --> 00:30:46,549
I'll see to it that you
never work in this town again.

400
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:49,685
You won't even get
a job collecting cans.

401
00:30:49,761 --> 00:30:53,458
Second, before you plunge
face-first into the cold cold world

402
00:30:53,532 --> 00:30:56,763
of unemployment, destitution
and eventual suicide,

403
00:30:56,835 --> 00:30:59,269
let me explain a little
something to you, pal!

404
00:30:59,337 --> 00:31:02,204
Shit rolls downhill.

405
00:31:02,274 --> 00:31:05,766
I'm at the top of that hill,
and you're at the bottom.

406
00:31:05,844 --> 00:31:08,870
So when I shit, it rolls down the hill

407
00:31:08,947 --> 00:31:10,778
and you eat it!

408
00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:14,148
That's the way of the world.
Always was, always will be.

409
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:17,154
Now, you got about five minutes
to evacuate this building

410
00:31:17,222 --> 00:31:18,587
before I
call security.

411
00:31:19,724 --> 00:31:21,419
Not much
time left, Digs.

412
00:31:21,493 --> 00:31:23,427
What do you
think you're doing?

413
00:31:23,495 --> 00:31:24,826
This isn't
fucking funny.

414
00:32:05,971 --> 00:32:07,233
How's it going?

415
00:32:08,473 --> 00:32:10,270
J ust one
minute, nigger.

416
00:32:10,342 --> 00:32:13,800
U h, I need to see
what's in that bag.

417
00:32:13,878 --> 00:32:15,311
Excuse me?

418
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:19,510
I said, I need to see
what's in that bag, Negro.

419
00:32:19,584 --> 00:32:21,916
I had a real heavy
workload today.

420
00:32:21,987 --> 00:32:22,749
U h-huh.

421
00:32:24,256 --> 00:32:25,917
So I just decided to
take all my files home

422
00:32:25,991 --> 00:32:28,459
and sort
of finish up.

423
00:32:28,526 --> 00:32:30,687
U hm, lemme ask
you a question.

424
00:32:30,762 --> 00:32:33,253
Do I look like
a rookie to you?

425
00:32:33,331 --> 00:32:37,324
My job is to maintain
security around here.

426
00:32:37,402 --> 00:32:39,996
All this. This is me,
bro. All of that. O K?

427
00:32:40,071 --> 00:32:42,198
How do I know that you're not stealing

428
00:32:42,274 --> 00:32:44,105
secret documents
in that bag?

429
00:32:44,175 --> 00:32:46,939
Which is a big-ass
bag by the way?

430
00:32:47,012 --> 00:32:50,539
So, I'm gonna ask you one
more time, African-American.

431
00:32:53,852 --> 00:32:55,979
I need to see
what's in that bag.

432
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:02,017
Damn!

433
00:33:03,862 --> 00:33:05,386
Hello?

434
00:33:05,463 --> 00:33:08,489
Woman, what did I tell you
about calling me at my job?

435
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:10,864
My job is to be
a security guard,

436
00:33:10,935 --> 00:33:13,802
I can't secure a shit if
I'm on the phone with you!

437
00:33:13,872 --> 00:33:16,864
And what the hell you up so late anyway?

438
00:33:16,941 --> 00:33:20,001
Eatin' crawfish? At
three in the morning?

439
00:33:20,078 --> 00:33:22,911
Woman, I swear to God when I
see you, I'm gonna kick your...

440
00:33:47,572 --> 00:33:50,063
You know, you were right, M r. Haney.

441
00:33:50,141 --> 00:33:53,702
It's a damn shame the way
these people live down here.

442
00:33:59,384 --> 00:34:00,715
Here you
go, brothers.

443
00:34:00,785 --> 00:34:05,017
Hot damn!
Thank you, baby.

444
00:34:32,016 --> 00:34:35,713
And then the pig looks
at the butcher and says,

445
00:34:35,787 --> 00:34:39,279
"Damn! I must have filled
out the wrong application!"

446
00:34:48,566 --> 00:34:51,330
Oh Brian, you should
be a stand-up comic.

447
00:34:51,403 --> 00:34:52,802
You're so funny.

448
00:34:52,871 --> 00:34:54,702
Me?
Nah.

449
00:34:54,773 --> 00:34:57,139
I better keep
my day job.

450
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:59,267
Speaking of
jobs, honey,

451
00:35:00,845 --> 00:35:05,942
with Haney gone, maybe
I'll get a promotion.

452
00:35:06,017 --> 00:35:07,917
Oh.

453
00:35:07,986 --> 00:35:10,216
Baby.

454
00:35:29,774 --> 00:35:32,072
I'm sure Otis will turn up soon.

455
00:35:32,143 --> 00:35:34,805
Maybe he just needed
to get away for a while.

456
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:39,316
No! No! Otis has
never not come home.

457
00:35:39,384 --> 00:35:44,048
Never! Never! Never!

458
00:35:44,122 --> 00:35:48,149
And I called the Police. And they said

459
00:35:48,226 --> 00:35:50,319
that I can't report
him missing

460
00:35:50,395 --> 00:35:55,025
because he hasn't been gone long enough!

461
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:59,092
I just know something
terrible has happened to him!

462
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,570
My Otis!

463
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:07,168
U hm, uh, I'm sure it's not
nearly as bad as you think.

464
00:36:07,245 --> 00:36:09,839
Right, Brian?
Baby.

465
00:36:09,914 --> 00:36:13,406
Yeah. I'm sure
Otis is fine.

466
00:36:13,485 --> 00:36:15,749
No he's not!

467
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:21,857
No!

468
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,127
Amber,

469
00:36:27,198 --> 00:36:31,225
there's something I
think I need to tell you.

470
00:36:31,302 --> 00:36:33,202
Otis made me promise not to tell.

471
00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:35,601
Oh.

472
00:36:35,673 --> 00:36:38,369
What? What
did Otis say?

473
00:36:38,443 --> 00:36:41,469
This is really
hard for me.

474
00:36:41,546 --> 00:36:45,141
I mean, you know how close
Otis and I, we're like brothers.

475
00:36:45,216 --> 00:36:46,843
Yeah, I know.

476
00:36:46,918 --> 00:36:49,580
I really feel like a
heel betraying a trust.

477
00:36:49,654 --> 00:36:53,090
Spit it out, Brian.
Amber deserves to know.

478
00:36:53,157 --> 00:36:54,988
I know, it's just so hard.

479
00:36:58,396 --> 00:37:00,660
Amber,

480
00:37:00,732 --> 00:37:02,825
Otis was
having an affair.

481
00:37:05,837 --> 00:37:08,237
An affair?

482
00:37:08,306 --> 00:37:09,500
My Otis?

483
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:11,474
I was just as surprised as you are.

484
00:37:11,543 --> 00:37:14,376
He said he'd been corresponding
back and forth off and on

485
00:37:14,445 --> 00:37:16,037
with his mistress
for over a year.

486
00:37:16,114 --> 00:37:19,015
He met her online
in some chatroom.

487
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:25,215
A mistress?
Online chatroom?

488
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,121
I ain't never seen Otis on no computer.

489
00:37:27,191 --> 00:37:30,285
And I never read anything
like this in his palm!

490
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:32,454
<i>I mean,
who Is she?</i>

491
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:35,055
Some young girl,
like 19 or 20.

492
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:36,725
What?

493
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:39,895
He said he was planning
on leaving you... for her.

494
00:37:41,973 --> 00:37:45,909
Oh. Oh no.
No. No.

495
00:37:45,977 --> 00:37:48,707
No, not my Otis.
No, he wouldn't... no.

496
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,375
I tried to talk him out
of it, Amber, really I did.

497
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:55,112
When last we spoke, I thought
he put the whole crazy idea

498
00:37:55,186 --> 00:37:57,882
out of his head.
I guess I was wrong.

499
00:37:57,956 --> 00:37:59,184
Oh no!

500
00:37:59,257 --> 00:38:00,622
I'm sorry, Amber.

501
00:38:00,692 --> 00:38:05,322
Amber, honey, it's not your fault.

502
00:38:05,396 --> 00:38:08,490
Maybe you're better off without him.

503
00:38:13,304 --> 00:38:14,737
Listen to me.

504
00:38:14,806 --> 00:38:16,171
If Otis doesn't
want you,

505
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,038
then you don't
want him.

506
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:22,102
Yeah, Amber! You're
still an attractive woman.

507
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,011
I'm sure there
are hundreds.

508
00:38:26,317 --> 00:38:29,252
Dora Lee's a couple guide.
She'll be thrilled to have you.

509
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:33,586
Yeah, Amber, it's time
you move on with your life.

510
00:38:33,658 --> 00:38:35,592
Right?
Right.

511
00:38:38,229 --> 00:38:39,560
You think so?

512
00:38:39,631 --> 00:38:42,862
Absolutely! Lt'd be
like a brand new start.

513
00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:46,370
A new lease on life. These
are exciting times for you.

514
00:38:46,437 --> 00:38:47,165
I like that.

515
00:38:47,238 --> 00:38:49,934
Yeah?

516
00:38:50,008 --> 00:38:55,705
Yeah.

517
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,946
<i>Yeah.</i>

518
00:38:59,684 --> 00:39:02,847
You know what?
You're both right.

519
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,152
Otis made his bed. Now he can lay in it.

520
00:39:07,225 --> 00:39:11,992
Yeah, that
crusty... old... ass!

521
00:39:12,063 --> 00:39:16,329
Ass, y'all! Yeah! He can
just stay where he is.

522
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:20,895
And that young heffer, I hope
she gives him a heart attack.

523
00:39:20,972 --> 00:39:24,772
Otis did me a favor.
That's right, you guys.

524
00:39:24,842 --> 00:39:28,539
It is time for me,
Amber, to have some fun!

525
00:39:28,613 --> 00:39:31,138
You... it...

526
00:39:31,215 --> 00:39:33,581
It's like my
momma said.

527
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:39,647
One monkey... don't stop no show.

528
00:39:39,724 --> 00:39:42,249
Especially no
monkey named Otis!

529
00:39:43,895 --> 00:39:46,659
Well, I just want
to thank you both

530
00:39:46,731 --> 00:39:49,222
for being
so supportive.

531
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,064
Oh, thank
you, Brian.

532
00:39:52,136 --> 00:39:56,266
You just need to go
home, forget about Otis,

533
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,433
and focus
on Amber.

534
00:39:58,509 --> 00:40:01,410
We love
you, Amber.

535
00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:03,413
And if you need anything at all,

536
00:40:03,481 --> 00:40:05,176
don't hesitate
to call.

537
00:40:05,249 --> 00:40:07,774
Oh, God bless
you both.

538
00:40:11,355 --> 00:40:14,620
Like we said, Amber,
don't be a stranger.

539
00:40:17,028 --> 00:40:21,089
Don't worry, Alfonso.
Your mom will be here soon.

540
00:40:46,124 --> 00:40:48,183
I'm solo on
a date, baby.

541
00:40:48,259 --> 00:40:52,059
M ichelle at the shop
working on some nappy-head.

542
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,654
Get your little
ass in the car.

543
00:40:57,668 --> 00:40:59,602
Oan't stand the
little motherfucker.

544
00:41:04,642 --> 00:41:07,770
So you his teacher?
You got a first name?

545
00:41:07,845 --> 00:41:09,312
M rs. Digs.

546
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,816
Take it easy, baby.

547
00:41:12,884 --> 00:41:14,647
Look at your
sexy little ass.

548
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:17,244
J ust trying to make
a little conversation.

549
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:20,313
I saw the way you
was looking at me.

550
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,429
Say something to your momma about this,

551
00:41:31,502 --> 00:41:33,970
I'm gonna beat you worse than
I did the last time. Hear me?

552
00:41:35,773 --> 00:41:39,038
Hey, hey! My name is Tonya.

553
00:41:51,355 --> 00:41:53,789
You know I ain't really
feeling M ichele no more.

554
00:41:53,858 --> 00:41:55,120
H mm.

555
00:41:55,193 --> 00:41:56,660
U h-uh.

556
00:41:56,727 --> 00:41:58,991
It's fucked up but I gotta
stay with her for a while

557
00:41:59,063 --> 00:42:01,054
'cause I'm trying
to stack my chips,

558
00:42:01,132 --> 00:42:04,295
get my dough right so I
can get back in the studio.

559
00:42:04,368 --> 00:42:07,337
The studio? So, uh, you sing?

560
00:42:07,405 --> 00:42:09,032
Baby, I rhyme.

561
00:42:09,106 --> 00:42:10,403
Oh.

562
00:42:10,474 --> 00:42:12,237
You wanna hear
a little something?

563
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,937
Oheck it out.

564
00:42:14,011 --> 00:42:16,070
One, two.
One, two.

565
00:42:16,147 --> 00:42:19,241
* Today is the day
I get to wax that ass *

566
00:42:19,317 --> 00:42:22,980
* Little school teacher Gonna
get me a pass To her class *

567
00:42:23,054 --> 00:42:25,852
* So I can wax it And smack

568
00:42:25,923 --> 00:42:29,882
* You know the rule,
Welcome to my school * *

569
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:32,591
You like that,
don't you?

570
00:42:32,663 --> 00:42:35,962
Ooh, yeah. You're very talented, Tyrone.

571
00:42:36,033 --> 00:42:40,094
I know that.

572
00:42:40,171 --> 00:42:41,365
So, uh,

573
00:42:43,341 --> 00:42:45,707
what time you say your
husband was coming home?

574
00:42:45,776 --> 00:42:48,336
Really late.

575
00:42:48,412 --> 00:42:50,277
Yeah.

576
00:42:50,348 --> 00:42:56,253
So, uhm, Tyrone,

577
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:02,623
what is your relationship
like with Alfonso?

578
00:43:02,693 --> 00:43:05,184
He's such
a little sweetheart.

579
00:43:06,497 --> 00:43:09,489
I can't stand
the little bastard.

580
00:43:09,567 --> 00:43:13,901
See, y'all think 'cause
he quiet, he's good,

581
00:43:13,971 --> 00:43:16,735
but I can't stand
little quiet motherfuckers.

582
00:43:16,807 --> 00:43:18,707
That's why I have to watch him.

583
00:43:18,776 --> 00:43:21,370
And I see him,
lookin' at me,

584
00:43:21,445 --> 00:43:23,572
cuttin' me little
dirty-ass looks,

585
00:43:23,648 --> 00:43:25,878
that's why every now
and then I gotta pop him

586
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:27,713
upside his little
nappy-ass head.

587
00:43:28,953 --> 00:43:29,942
H mm.

588
00:43:30,021 --> 00:43:31,989
Keep him in line
and shit.

589
00:43:32,056 --> 00:43:35,150
But fuck all,

590
00:43:35,226 --> 00:43:37,057
You know I came
here to fuck.

591
00:43:37,128 --> 00:43:37,992
Really?

592
00:43:38,062 --> 00:43:38,926
Yeah.

593
00:43:38,996 --> 00:43:40,020
This what
you want?

594
00:43:40,097 --> 00:43:41,291
You know that's
what I want.

595
00:43:41,365 --> 00:43:42,332
Right now?

596
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,459
Right now.

597
00:43:44,535 --> 00:43:48,369
O K, let's go
to the bedroom.

598
00:43:48,439 --> 00:43:50,737
Let's go.

599
00:43:53,077 --> 00:43:54,203
Oh!

600
00:43:54,278 --> 00:43:55,609
Oome on, girl!

601
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,012
Oh, O K,
hold it, Tyrone.

602
00:43:58,082 --> 00:44:00,380
Something I need
to tell you.

603
00:44:00,451 --> 00:44:02,180
What?

604
00:44:02,253 --> 00:44:03,777
I'm a freak.

605
00:44:03,854 --> 00:44:06,550
Shit.
So am I.

606
00:44:06,624 --> 00:44:09,388
Oh! No, no!
O K. No, no, no.

607
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,792
I mean, for real.
I'm a real freak.

608
00:44:11,862 --> 00:44:15,457
I'm strictly...
into freaky things.

609
00:44:15,533 --> 00:44:17,296
Like what?

610
00:44:17,368 --> 00:44:18,630
Handcuffs.

611
00:44:18,703 --> 00:44:22,002
Handcuffs?! You out
of your goddamn mind!

612
00:44:22,073 --> 00:44:23,870
I ain't about to let you handcuff me!

613
00:44:23,941 --> 00:44:25,374
Then it's time
for you to go

614
00:44:25,443 --> 00:44:27,638
'cause I only deal with
men who are on my level.

615
00:44:27,712 --> 00:44:31,512
Oh, fuck that. I ain't no punk now!

616
00:44:31,582 --> 00:44:33,948
Go and get
them cuffs.

617
00:44:34,018 --> 00:44:37,749
You're into this
kind of shit?

618
00:44:41,058 --> 00:44:45,927
Relax, Tyrone. You just
have to keep an open mind.

619
00:44:51,769 --> 00:44:53,964
What are you
gonna do with that?

620
00:44:56,607 --> 00:44:58,302
Oomfy?

621
00:44:58,376 --> 00:45:02,210
M mm.

622
00:45:02,279 --> 00:45:06,049
M m.

623
00:45:08,252 --> 00:45:09,947
That's what
I'm talking about!

624
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:12,148
I better get
some protection.

625
00:45:12,223 --> 00:45:13,713
Protection?
Where you goin'?

626
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:16,021
You got me
all worked up!

627
00:45:16,093 --> 00:45:19,085
We don't need no protection!
Oome on, we both clean! Oome on!

628
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,444
Hey.

629
00:45:34,515 --> 00:45:36,676
This ain't what
it look like.

630
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:42,516
But you got to know,
your bitch chose me. O K?

631
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:44,922
Now,

632
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,482
you look like
a gentleman,

633
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,425
we can handle this
like two gentlemen.

634
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:49,758
Or you can
uncuff me,

635
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,661
and we can get into some gangster shit.

636
00:45:51,732 --> 00:45:54,963
What you laughin' at,
nigger? This ain't funny.

637
00:45:55,036 --> 00:45:57,732
Now you uncuff me and she
gonna be downright hilarious

638
00:45:57,805 --> 00:45:59,466
because of the shit
I'm gonna do.

639
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:03,135
Where the fuck Tonya at? Tonya! Tonya!

640
00:46:05,546 --> 00:46:07,741
Aw.

641
00:46:09,116 --> 00:46:10,777
M mmm.

642
00:46:18,726 --> 00:46:20,318
What are you
gonna do with that?

643
00:46:44,485 --> 00:46:45,975
He was good
for me.

644
00:48:25,786 --> 00:48:27,481
Well, from
the looks of it,

645
00:48:27,555 --> 00:48:30,149
you two won't be requiring
my services any longer.

646
00:48:30,224 --> 00:48:33,022
<i>What's the secret?</i>

647
00:48:33,094 --> 00:48:37,224
Well, basically,

648
00:48:37,298 --> 00:48:40,734
we just found something fun to do.

649
00:48:40,801 --> 00:48:41,733
Together.

650
00:48:41,802 --> 00:48:43,565
Ah.

651
00:48:43,637 --> 00:48:47,767
<i>Well, congratulatlons.</i>

652
00:48:51,879 --> 00:48:53,904
<i>Honey, I have
to confess.</i>

653
00:48:53,981 --> 00:48:56,142
I've never been so
happy in my whole life.

654
00:48:56,217 --> 00:48:58,014
I feel the
same way.

655
00:48:58,085 --> 00:48:59,882
O K, Brian,
I was thinking,

656
00:48:59,954 --> 00:49:02,149
we never really
had a honeymoon,

657
00:49:02,223 --> 00:49:05,215
and neither of us have
been to the islands, so,

658
00:49:05,292 --> 00:49:07,089
maybe we
should go.

659
00:49:07,161 --> 00:49:09,994
<i>So then thls Splc
smashes Into me, rlght?</i>

660
00:49:10,064 --> 00:49:12,658
So I get out of the car
to check the damage,

661
00:49:12,733 --> 00:49:15,759
but really, it's to make
sure this little wetback prick

662
00:49:15,836 --> 00:49:19,169
doesn't try to run. None
of these Spics ever have

663
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,300
legal registration
or any insurance.

664
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:26,278
<i>Then thls blg nlgger
stops hls car and gets out,</i>

665
00:49:26,347 --> 00:49:28,781
as if it's any of
his freakin' business.

666
00:49:28,849 --> 00:49:31,682
At this point, I'm looking
around, I'm wondering,

667
00:49:31,752 --> 00:49:35,654
Am I the only fuckin'
American here? Fuck.

668
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:37,554
Excuse me, sir.

669
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:39,718
My wife and I are
trying to enjoy our meal.

670
00:49:39,793 --> 00:49:42,694
Would you mind lowering
your voice just a little?

671
00:49:45,833 --> 00:49:49,769
Anyway, this big nigger
walks up like he's a cop,

672
00:49:49,837 --> 00:49:53,705
but, check this out, he completely
ignores me, the white guy,

673
00:49:53,774 --> 00:49:55,401
and starts talkin'
to the Spic!

674
00:49:55,476 --> 00:49:58,309
Oan you believe
that shit? Fuck!

675
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:17,921
So, the Islands?

676
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:27,297
Where'd I park
that piece of shit?

677
00:50:33,514 --> 00:50:37,951
Agh. Agh! You
son of a bitch!

678
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:46,120
What do
you think?

679
00:50:46,193 --> 00:50:48,184
Again.

680
00:50:50,664 --> 00:50:52,996
Wooo!

681
00:50:53,067 --> 00:50:54,534
One more
for the road.

682
00:50:54,602 --> 00:50:57,730
Whoo!

683
00:51:13,721 --> 00:51:16,554
Wait, wait!
Wait, brother!

684
00:51:16,624 --> 00:51:19,058
I didn't even see you
hit that white dude.

685
00:51:19,126 --> 00:51:21,492
I was just smoking my joint.
It's not worth killing me.

686
00:51:21,562 --> 00:51:24,827
I'm just a waiter. How
much is it worth killing me?

687
00:51:24,898 --> 00:51:27,799
Oome on, this is black
on black crime, brother.

688
00:51:27,868 --> 00:51:31,395
The worse thing I do is
smoke weed. The last I smoke.

689
00:51:31,472 --> 00:51:33,633
I just went back
to school.

690
00:51:33,707 --> 00:51:36,107
I dropped out of J unior
H igh a long time ago.

691
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,438
I'm back in
the 9th grade.

692
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,069
I'm trying to make
shit happen.

693
00:51:39,146 --> 00:51:41,080
I'm just trying to
take care of my kids.

694
00:51:41,148 --> 00:51:42,638
I got four of them,
five maybe.

695
00:51:42,716 --> 00:51:45,310
I'm in the church,
and I'm in the mosque.

696
00:51:45,386 --> 00:51:48,048
Allah is good,
but so is Jesus.

697
00:51:48,122 --> 00:51:50,147
I'm gonna pick
that joint up,

698
00:51:50,224 --> 00:51:52,749
you and I gonna go
sit down, smoke it

699
00:51:52,826 --> 00:51:54,851
and you tell me
how I could come up,

700
00:51:54,928 --> 00:51:58,364
get suits like that,
Range Rover like that.

701
00:51:58,432 --> 00:52:00,024
And we could
be friends.

702
00:52:09,643 --> 00:52:11,110
We better go, baby.

703
00:52:29,863 --> 00:52:31,296
What's wrong?

704
00:52:35,336 --> 00:52:37,133
I was just
thinkin', honey.

705
00:52:37,204 --> 00:52:39,900
We said we'd only kill
people that deserved it.

706
00:52:39,973 --> 00:52:44,637
That guy in the parking
lot, he didn't deserve it.

707
00:52:44,712 --> 00:52:46,839
He was just in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

708
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:49,178
Baby, we did what we had to do.

709
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:52,582
That guy saw our car, he saw our faces,

710
00:52:52,653 --> 00:52:56,214
what were we supposed to
do? Let him turn us in?

711
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:59,817
We're just now starting
to enjoy our lives.

712
00:52:59,893 --> 00:53:05,160
And I'll be damned if I let
anyone or anything spoil that.

713
00:53:05,232 --> 00:53:06,529
O K?

714
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:12,698
Now we came here
to have fun.

715
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:14,604
Okey-dokey?

716
00:53:15,642 --> 00:53:18,440
So let's go
and dance.

717
00:53:18,512 --> 00:53:21,140
<i>M ista performed

718
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:25,675

00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:35,094

722
00:53:35,162 --> 00:53:37,926

723
00:53:37,998 --> 00:53:42,697

724
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:45,330
<i>* Hey, mlsta, you don't
Have to be so mean *</i>

725
00:53:45,406 --> 00:53:48,000
<i>* How can I get
Down on your beat *</i>

726
00:54:29,149 --> 00:54:34,086
<i>* Don't you ever stop Watch

727
00:54:34,154 --> 00:54:36,816
<i>* Hey mlsta, you don't

728
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:39,586

729
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:44,654
<i>* Don't you ever cease Rock

730
00:54:44,731 --> 00:54:46,995
Excuse me for
a second, baby.

731
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:53,636
Ha.
Wow.

732
00:55:09,423 --> 00:55:12,449
What can I get for you tonight, brother?

733
00:55:12,526 --> 00:55:16,018
I think we'll try
something different.

734
00:55:16,096 --> 00:55:19,259
I think we'll have
two glasses of red rum.

735
00:55:19,333 --> 00:55:20,129
Good choice.

736
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:37,445
But for real.
If that guy showed

737
00:55:37,518 --> 00:55:39,713
Don't you hate it when
guys try to make muscles

738
00:55:39,786 --> 00:55:41,447
where they
ain't got none?

739
00:55:41,522 --> 00:55:44,252
Oh, for real,
for real.

740
00:55:44,324 --> 00:55:47,316
Girl, do you see
what I see?

741
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:53,157
Looks like some bitches just don't
know how to hold their liquor.

742
00:56:00,374 --> 00:56:01,636
Here you guys go.

743
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:03,801
Thank you.

744
00:56:03,877 --> 00:56:06,345
Ah, just in time.

745
00:56:06,413 --> 00:56:07,744
Oh!

746
00:56:10,717 --> 00:56:13,185
To us.

747
00:56:29,102 --> 00:56:31,070
Ahh.

748
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:33,538
Whoo!

749
00:56:33,607 --> 00:56:35,097
Yeah!

750
00:56:41,348 --> 00:56:44,374
<i>* I'm the man *</i>

751
00:56:49,389 --> 00:56:51,857
<i>* I'm the man *</i>

752
00:56:57,698 --> 00:56:59,188
<i>* I'm the man * *</i>

753
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:30,462
Oh, baby...

754
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:35,365
Honey, honey,
please, not now.

755
00:57:35,435 --> 00:57:37,630
Don't I look
sexy enough?

756
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:40,229
Honey, you look
very sexy, honey.

757
00:57:40,307 --> 00:57:45,176
I just need a moment
to pull myself together.

758
00:57:45,245 --> 00:57:46,644
Okay.

759
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:51,277
What's wrong, baby?

760
00:57:53,987 --> 00:57:57,047
I stopped by the garage
to get the oil checked.

761
00:57:57,124 --> 00:57:58,284
Okay.

762
00:57:58,358 --> 00:58:00,189
And that's when
I saw him.

763
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:04,526
He didn't see me
but I saw him.

764
00:58:04,598 --> 00:58:09,126
He had on a mechanics
uniform. He must work there.

765
00:58:09,202 --> 00:58:12,069
I hadn't seen him
in 15 years but

766
00:58:12,139 --> 00:58:14,733
I recognized him the moment I saw him.

767
00:58:14,808 --> 00:58:15,900
Who, baby?

768
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,638
Butch Bailey.

769
00:58:21,715 --> 00:58:25,651
Who is this Butch Bailey and
what did he do to you, baby?

770
00:58:27,621 --> 00:58:30,715
Butch Bailey was the kid
who terrorized me every day

771
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:34,090
of my entire
high school career.

772
00:58:34,161 --> 00:58:36,994
For Butch, my torment,
was his entertainment!

773
00:58:37,064 --> 00:58:41,194
Taking my hard-earned lunch money
wasn't enough for this guy, oh no.

774
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:45,728
Our daily routine consisted of
nuggies, frogs, wedgies, the works.

775
00:58:45,806 --> 00:58:52,006
He used to call me Oharlie Brown
because of the shape of my head.

776
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:57,517
J ust when I started
feeling cool.

777
00:58:57,584 --> 00:59:00,348
Butch Bailey pulled the
nerve right back out of me.

778
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:06,620
Honey, I think it's time we settled
the score with this Butch Bailey.

779
00:59:06,693 --> 00:59:07,990
H uh?

780
00:59:08,061 --> 00:59:10,859
I think it would
be therapeutic.

781
00:59:10,931 --> 00:59:15,493
It would be like exorcising
a demon from your past.

782
00:59:15,569 --> 00:59:20,939
Now you know where Butch Bailey works.

783
00:59:21,007 --> 00:59:24,135
J ust go down there and pay him a visit.

784
00:59:24,211 --> 00:59:30,150
And

785
00:59:32,919 --> 00:59:37,117
Whoo!

786
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:38,953
Go get
him, baby.

787
00:59:47,534 --> 00:59:50,162
It's been a long time, Butch.

788
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:03,247
Hey Butch! Say hello
to my little friend.

789
01:00:11,625 --> 01:00:18,326
<i>Dudel Rlght now, what
you're dolng Is wrong I</i>

790
01:00:18,398 --> 01:00:21,595
<i>Yes, you I The Lord told me to tell you</i>

791
01:00:21,668 --> 01:00:25,832
<i>that what you're dolng Is
wrong as the day Is long.</i>

792
01:00:25,906 --> 01:00:30,843
<i>What? You thlnk the Lord aln't
hlp to your dastardly deeds?</i>

793
01:00:30,911 --> 01:00:33,778
<i>You thlnk the Lord aln't peeklng on you?</i>

794
01:00:33,847 --> 01:00:35,542
<i>U h-huh I</i>

795
01:00:35,615 --> 01:00:38,243
<i>But It's not too late
to save your twlsted soul</i>

796
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:40,912
<i>from eternal damnatlon.</i>

797
01:00:40,987 --> 01:00:46,186
<i>The questlon Is, are you ready
to answer the Lord's call?</i>

798
01:00:46,259 --> 01:00:50,787
<i>Are you ready to answer
the Lord's call? I</i>

799
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,564
Where's your garage?

800
01:01:01,641 --> 01:01:03,802
It's about
two blocks over.

801
01:01:05,378 --> 01:01:08,609
Okay, let's go
get him, baby.

802
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:13,215
Honey, I've been
doing some thinking.

803
01:01:13,286 --> 01:01:18,849
This thing between Butch
and I is kinda personal.

804
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:22,656
Maybe this is one
I should do alone.

805
01:01:22,729 --> 01:01:28,725
Baby! I want in
on the action.

806
01:01:28,802 --> 01:01:30,667
I know you
do, honey,

807
01:01:30,737 --> 01:01:34,104
but this is one

808
01:01:34,174 --> 01:01:35,698
I need to do
on my own.

809
01:01:54,694 --> 01:01:57,754
Alright, baby.

810
01:01:57,831 --> 01:02:01,892
M m, mm, mm.

811
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:04,766
Go and get him.

812
01:02:16,016 --> 01:02:18,849
I'm looking
for Butch Bailey.

813
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:21,586
<i>Hold on.</i>

814
01:02:33,066 --> 01:02:35,364
What you want, man?

815
01:02:35,435 --> 01:02:37,869
You don't
remember me?

816
01:02:39,239 --> 01:02:40,501
Hell, no.

817
01:02:40,573 --> 01:02:43,974
We both went to
Mount Vernon H igh.

818
01:02:44,044 --> 01:02:47,172
You used to pick
on me every day.

819
01:02:49,282 --> 01:02:56,313
Oharlie Brown? Aw, hell
now, after all these years.

820
01:02:56,389 --> 01:02:59,984
My man, Oharlie Brown,
come here, old boy.

821
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:03,223
Look at you,
looking all smooth.

822
01:03:03,296 --> 01:03:06,424
Yo, where is it? Where the lunch
money? Where the lunch money?

823
01:03:06,499 --> 01:03:11,334
Man, I used to whoop
your ass back in the day.

824
01:03:11,404 --> 01:03:13,599
So what you doin'
in my shop?

825
01:03:13,673 --> 01:03:14,970
Need your
car fixed?

826
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,770
Hell, I took your money back in the day,

827
01:03:16,843 --> 01:03:18,834
I might as well take
it now too, huh?

828
01:03:18,912 --> 01:03:21,642
Remember that time when I
made you eat all that dirt

829
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:23,706
right in front
of the Ohilean team?

830
01:03:23,783 --> 01:03:27,742
Now that shit was
funny as hell.

831
01:03:27,821 --> 01:03:31,814
Oharlie Brown. My man, Oharlie Brown.

832
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:41,731
<i>What you're dolng Is wrong
as the day Is long.</i>

833
01:03:47,507 --> 01:03:50,442
<i>You thlnk the Lord aln't peeklng on you?</i>

834
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:52,171
<i>U h-huh I</i>

835
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:55,271
<i>But It's not too late
to save your twlsted soul</i>

836
01:03:55,348 --> 01:03:57,111
<i>from eternal damnatlon.</i>

837
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:59,743
Man, you remember
that time I...

838
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,858
Did you get
him, baby?

839
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:19,064
What did you do
with the body?

840
01:04:23,176 --> 01:04:24,302
What happened, baby?

841
01:04:28,081 --> 01:04:29,309
Brian?

842
01:04:29,382 --> 01:04:35,582
Honey, we've had
a lot of fun.

843
01:04:35,655 --> 01:04:38,283
Our lives have undergone
a transformation

844
01:04:38,358 --> 01:04:41,555
that very few
ever experience.

845
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:50,161
We found that thing that brought
that spark into our lives.

846
01:04:50,236 --> 01:04:53,569
But now it's time to stop.

847
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,632
What are you
talking about, Brian?

848
01:04:56,709 --> 01:04:59,143
I'm talking about the killing, Tonya.

849
01:04:59,212 --> 01:05:01,646
It has to stop.

850
01:05:01,714 --> 01:05:04,205
Why?

851
01:05:04,284 --> 01:05:10,018
Honey, what we've been doing
is as wrong as the day is long.

852
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:12,820
You think the Lord
hasn't been peeping us?

853
01:05:12,892 --> 01:05:15,725
You think he's not hip
to our dastardly deeds?

854
01:05:15,795 --> 01:05:21,392
Oh no, honey. He's seen it
all and he don't like it.

855
01:05:21,468 --> 01:05:23,527
But it's not
too late.

856
01:05:23,603 --> 01:05:25,002
The question is...

857
01:05:30,243 --> 01:05:34,270
are we ready... to
answer the Lord's call?

858
01:05:36,049 --> 01:05:37,573
Whatever happened
to questioning

859
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:40,949
everything we've been
taught all of our lives?

860
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,079
Whatever happened to
being tired of doing

861
01:05:43,156 --> 01:05:46,216
the so-called
"right thing?"

862
01:05:48,094 --> 01:05:51,359
I thought we decided
to have some fun.

863
01:05:51,431 --> 01:05:54,264
And live by our own set of rules.

864
01:05:55,902 --> 01:05:59,736
Things have changed.
I've changed.

865
01:05:59,806 --> 01:06:05,108
Now, I know this is a lot to ask.

866
01:06:05,178 --> 01:06:07,942
But I need you
to change too.

867
01:06:08,014 --> 01:06:11,313
I n the name
of our love,

868
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:14,410
I need you to stop the killing.

869
01:06:20,627 --> 01:06:23,095
Alright, baby.

870
01:06:23,163 --> 01:06:27,065
If it means that
much to you,

871
01:06:27,133 --> 01:06:29,260
we can stop.

872
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:32,533
Thank you, Tonya.

873
01:06:32,605 --> 01:06:33,663
Oh.

874
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,207
Thank you!

875
01:07:54,187 --> 01:07:58,453
I n the name of God,
Satan, I rebuke you!

876
01:09:09,262 --> 01:09:11,127
Okay!
Okay!

877
01:09:26,646 --> 01:09:28,307
H mm.

878
01:09:28,381 --> 01:09:32,044
Thank God we're no longer
a part of that foolishness.

879
01:09:32,118 --> 01:09:35,053
Yeah.
Thank God.

880
01:09:35,121 --> 01:09:37,055
Whoo!

881
01:09:47,233 --> 01:09:49,633
Ma'am, although you
haven't said a word yet,

882
01:09:49,702 --> 01:09:52,796
I can tell you're a woman who
likes to get the job done right.

883
01:09:52,872 --> 01:09:55,602
Aren't you tired of slaving over
your meals with dull utensils?

884
01:09:55,675 --> 01:10:00,772
Don't you wish you could chop up
food like those Japanese chefs?

885
01:10:00,847 --> 01:10:02,178
Well, now you can.

886
01:10:10,356 --> 01:10:13,689
Ma'am, do you mind if I step in
and give you a free demonstration?

887
01:10:15,328 --> 01:10:16,852
Please do.

888
01:10:31,177 --> 01:10:32,872
Honey!

889
01:10:32,945 --> 01:10:35,038
I'm home early.

890
01:10:35,114 --> 01:10:37,378
Guess who got
promoted today?

891
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:39,042
Time to celebrate.

892
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,554
Tonya?

893
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:51,690
Tonya?

894
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:57,097
Honey?

895
01:11:03,075 --> 01:11:05,737
Honey?

896
01:11:11,617 --> 01:11:14,484
Brian, honey,
you're home early!

897
01:11:23,596 --> 01:11:25,154
Are you mad?

898
01:11:27,233 --> 01:11:29,667
<i>Am I mad?
Am I mad?</i>

899
01:11:29,735 --> 01:11:30,793
Yeah.

900
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,132
I come home early
to celebrate

901
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:33,695
a promotion
with my wife

902
01:11:33,773 --> 01:11:36,071
and find her cutting up
some strange man in our tub!

903
01:11:36,142 --> 01:11:38,337
Oh, congratulations
on the promotion, baby!

904
01:11:38,411 --> 01:11:39,935
Don't congratulate
me now.

905
01:11:40,012 --> 01:11:42,742
You strangled all the joy
out of that accomplishment.

906
01:11:42,815 --> 01:11:46,945
You lied to me, Tonya.
You betrayed our trust.

907
01:11:47,019 --> 01:11:49,715
Wait a minute, Brian. We had
a good thing going on here

908
01:11:49,789 --> 01:11:52,622
before you caught the holy
ghost and flipped the script.

909
01:11:52,692 --> 01:11:54,523
Yeah, maybe
I was wrong

910
01:11:54,594 --> 01:11:56,357
to tell you what you wanted to hear?

911
01:11:56,429 --> 01:12:00,160
Was it right to impose
your holy world ways on me?

912
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:04,101
U nlike some people,
I like to keep it real.

913
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:07,799
It's not my fault that you are too pussy

914
01:12:07,874 --> 01:12:10,502
to have
any real fun.

915
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:11,873
What did you
just call me?

916
01:12:11,944 --> 01:12:12,808
A pussy!

917
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:16,040
Oan you
hear yourself?

918
01:12:16,115 --> 01:12:17,742
Oan you hear
yourself, honey?

919
01:12:17,817 --> 01:12:20,615
Since when do you talk to me like that?

920
01:12:20,686 --> 01:12:23,678
I can't believe
what you've become.

921
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:26,054
Whatever I've become,
you made me.

922
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:28,059
Don't you try to turn this around on me!

923
01:12:28,127 --> 01:12:30,322
I'm trying to save your
soul from the fires of hell!

924
01:12:30,396 --> 01:12:32,591
You're going...

925
01:12:39,238 --> 01:12:42,264
Good evening, M r. Digs.
I'm Detective Gonzalez.

926
01:12:42,341 --> 01:12:44,673
I was wondering
if I could, uh,

927
01:12:44,744 --> 01:12:46,541
ask you and your wife
a few questions.

928
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:49,638
<i>I'm sure you're
both aware</i>

929
01:12:49,715 --> 01:12:54,175
of the recent serial murders
we've been experiencing.

930
01:12:54,253 --> 01:12:57,620
Yeah, yeah. We... we heard about it.

931
01:12:59,592 --> 01:13:04,359
Yeah. Well, before all the
bodies started popping up,

932
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:08,594
I was assigned to a few
missing persons cases

933
01:13:08,668 --> 01:13:12,798
and as, uh, coincidental
as this may sound,

934
01:13:12,872 --> 01:13:18,071
the both of you are linked to
some of those persons in question.

935
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:19,873
We are?

936
01:13:19,946 --> 01:13:20,878
Yeah.

937
01:13:22,214 --> 01:13:23,340
How is
that possible?

938
01:13:23,416 --> 01:13:27,113
Well, there's
Dudley Haney.

939
01:13:27,186 --> 01:13:29,654
That's your
employer, M r. Digs.

940
01:13:29,722 --> 01:13:32,190
And Tyrone Davis is a
live-in mama's boyfriend

941
01:13:32,258 --> 01:13:34,624
of one of
M rs. Digs' students.

942
01:13:34,694 --> 01:13:38,323
And Otis H ughes, that's
your next door neighbor.

943
01:13:38,397 --> 01:13:40,160
Now he just stopped
showing up at his job.

944
01:13:40,232 --> 01:13:43,326
H is wife placed a missing persons call,

945
01:13:43,402 --> 01:13:46,394
but we haven't been
able to reach her since.

946
01:13:46,472 --> 01:13:48,963
Ohh.

947
01:13:49,041 --> 01:13:53,478
Wow, that, uh,
that is a coincidence.

948
01:14:00,953 --> 01:14:04,411
<i>Detectlve Gonzalez, we
appreclate your stopplng by</i>

949
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:07,789
and we're really concerned
about those missing people

950
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:11,728
but I'm afraid we won't
be of much help to you.

951
01:14:11,797 --> 01:14:14,789
H mm.
Well,

952
01:14:16,502 --> 01:14:18,663
wouldn't it be
something, though,

953
01:14:18,738 --> 01:14:20,797
if the perpetrators
of those missing guys

954
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:25,333
were somehow connected to
the recent serial killings?

955
01:14:25,411 --> 01:14:26,935
Ha, ha.

956
01:14:28,347 --> 01:14:29,405
Yeah.

957
01:14:29,482 --> 01:14:31,040
That would
be something.

958
01:14:31,117 --> 01:14:36,020
Well, I've taken up enough of
your time this fine evening.

959
01:14:36,088 --> 01:14:40,149
Listen, if either of you
happen to recollect anything

960
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:43,161
that might be
of some assistance,

961
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:45,595
please give me
a call.

962
01:14:47,967 --> 01:14:49,059
You bet.

963
01:14:49,135 --> 01:14:52,502
And, uh,
before I go,

964
01:14:53,973 --> 01:14:56,373
do you mind if I use your bathroom?

965
01:15:01,647 --> 01:15:02,807
U h...

966
01:15:02,882 --> 01:15:05,316
Of course you can use our bathroom.

967
01:15:05,384 --> 01:15:07,113
It's just right down the hall.

968
01:15:07,186 --> 01:15:09,882
U hm, great. Thank you very much.

969
01:15:13,959 --> 01:15:14,948
<i>Rlght over here?</i>

970
01:15:15,027 --> 01:15:16,892
Yeah, just down
that hall.

971
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:26,770
I hope they have
some air freshener

972
01:15:26,839 --> 01:15:30,070
'cause I'm about
to blow the sucker up.

973
01:15:46,225 --> 01:15:48,716
I'm getting pretty good
with this motherfucker.

974
01:15:54,366 --> 01:15:55,594
Oome on, baby.

975
01:15:55,668 --> 01:15:57,363
We gotta cut up
the detective

976
01:15:57,436 --> 01:15:59,336
so we can toss him out
with the salesman.

977
01:15:59,405 --> 01:16:03,501
We? My, aren't
we plural today?

978
01:16:03,576 --> 01:16:05,601
"We" aren't
doing anything.

979
01:16:05,678 --> 01:16:09,170
Because "we" didn't kill anybody today.

980
01:16:09,248 --> 01:16:11,079
You're on your own
with this one, honey.

981
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:14,176
Fine. You think I need your
help to get rid of these two?

982
01:16:14,253 --> 01:16:16,813
I've taken out more people
than you could ever count.

983
01:16:16,889 --> 01:16:18,982
I didn't need you then
and I don't need you now.

984
01:16:21,794 --> 01:16:22,783
Wait a second.

985
01:16:32,238 --> 01:16:34,206
Baby.

986
01:16:34,273 --> 01:16:38,710
If you think I'm trusting
you with this, you're crazy.

987
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:20,444
Tonya?

988
01:17:20,519 --> 01:17:23,147
We need to talk.

989
01:17:39,371 --> 01:17:42,772
I've been doing
some thinking.

990
01:17:42,842 --> 01:17:46,073
Something you said earlier
was absolutely right.

991
01:17:46,145 --> 01:17:48,238
This is all
my fault.

992
01:17:48,314 --> 01:17:51,306
I'm the one who brought you into this.

993
01:17:51,383 --> 01:17:54,546
And I'm sorry.

994
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:59,421
But just like I started
it, I have to finish it.

995
01:17:59,491 --> 01:18:02,358
I asked you nicely
before to stop.

996
01:18:02,428 --> 01:18:04,692
Now I really
mean it, honey.

997
01:18:07,299 --> 01:18:10,166
I need you to stop
the killing right now.

998
01:18:10,236 --> 01:18:12,067
Or,

999
01:18:12,137 --> 01:18:14,799
you'll force me to do
what I have to do.

1000
01:18:17,676 --> 01:18:19,837
Fine by
me, Brian.

1001
01:18:19,912 --> 01:18:23,609
If you feel you have to
do what you have to do,

1002
01:18:23,682 --> 01:18:27,550
then I guess I have to do
what I have to do too.

1003
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:31,778
Fine.

1004
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:35,620
Fine.

1005
01:18:55,614 --> 01:18:58,344
Lord,

1006
01:18:58,417 --> 01:19:02,046
I'm at a major
crossroads here.

1007
01:19:02,121 --> 01:19:04,351
J ust like Abraham,

1008
01:19:04,423 --> 01:19:08,416
I've been called to do
something that I really,

1009
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:14,990
really, really, do not want to do.

1010
01:19:15,067 --> 01:19:17,661
I ask that you give
me the strength,

1011
01:19:17,736 --> 01:19:21,729
to stop the evil
that I have created.

1012
01:21:02,775 --> 01:21:07,235
I'm sorry, Lord.
I just couldn't...

1013
01:21:09,381 --> 01:21:11,349
I'm sorry, baby.

1014
01:21:18,323 --> 01:21:19,722
Why won't
you die?

1015
01:21:21,593 --> 01:21:23,823
Whoo-whooo!

1016
01:21:37,376 --> 01:21:39,844
Forgive me, honey,
but I have to do this

1017
01:21:39,912 --> 01:21:42,312
once and for all.

1018
01:21:42,381 --> 01:21:44,474
Whoa!

1019
01:21:54,326 --> 01:21:55,452
What you got?

1020
01:21:55,527 --> 01:21:57,085
What you got, Brian?
What you got?

1021
01:21:57,162 --> 01:21:59,824
That's how you want it,
honey? Let's see what you got.

1022
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:06,566
Yeah.

1023
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:16,044
You're so suspect.

1024
01:22:16,115 --> 01:22:18,583
You little pussy.

1025
01:23:18,043 --> 01:23:19,738
Aha!

1026
01:24:00,352 --> 01:24:06,291
Well, honey, I guess
this is where it all ends.

1027
01:24:06,358 --> 01:24:11,455
<i>Klnda poetlc
justlce, huh?</i>

1028
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:17,560
But in all honesty, I'll meet
my end with only one regret.

1029
01:24:17,636 --> 01:24:19,695
And that one regret
is that I led you

1030
01:24:19,771 --> 01:24:24,640
down the path of
psychopathic madness.

1031
01:24:24,710 --> 01:24:29,909
Honey, I hope that my
death will open your eyes

1032
01:24:29,982 --> 01:24:34,510
to what you... to
what we became.

1033
01:24:34,586 --> 01:24:38,545
And if my death will help
you find your own salvation,

1034
01:24:38,624 --> 01:24:41,491
then I gladly
give my life.

1035
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:44,324
Because...

1036
01:24:44,396 --> 01:24:48,025
I love you, Tonya.

1037
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:52,730
Well, with all that
having been said,

1038
01:24:52,804 --> 01:24:54,101
shoot!

1039
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:03,871
Oh, Brian.

1040
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:08,283
Oh, honey.

1041
01:25:20,565 --> 01:25:22,362
I'm sorry, baby.

1042
01:25:23,802 --> 01:25:25,167
<i>That's alrlght.</i>

1043
01:25:31,643 --> 01:25:33,304
We gotta step
it up, honey.

1044
01:25:33,845 --> 01:25:35,642
Our flight leaves
in two hours.

1045
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:37,545
This is so
exciting, Brian.

1046
01:25:37,616 --> 01:25:39,106
I always wanted
to go to the Islands.

1047
01:25:39,184 --> 01:25:41,914
I'd never dream that we would
actually be living there.

1048
01:25:41,987 --> 01:25:43,784
No one will ever find us there, honey.

1049
01:25:43,855 --> 01:25:45,516
Once we get there
and get settled in,

1050
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:47,148
and take on those
new identities,

1051
01:25:47,225 --> 01:25:48,749
we can put all this stuff behind us.

1052
01:25:48,827 --> 01:25:50,488
Oh!

1053
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:54,328
Baby, it's like we're starting all over.

1054
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:57,129
A never-ending
honeymoon. Give it to me.

1055
01:26:00,339 --> 01:26:01,863
My God!

1056
01:26:01,940 --> 01:26:02,907
Okay.

1057
01:26:02,974 --> 01:26:04,566
Okay!

1058
01:26:11,383 --> 01:26:12,372
Oh.

1059
01:26:14,019 --> 01:26:15,008
Oh.

1060
01:26:17,422 --> 01:26:18,411
Okay.
