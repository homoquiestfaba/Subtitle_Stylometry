1
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,396
For the love of God,
please ask me the question now.

2
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:44,970
Geography.

3
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:50,439
"What is the second largest city

4
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,238
in the Soviet Union?"

5
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:55,246
Moscow is the largest.
Any fool would know that.

6
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:59,307
A clever man might say Novosibirsk,

7
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,647
'cause it's the capital of Siberia.

8
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:03,449
- Might be overthinking things.
- Might.

9
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:05,148
Uh-oh.

10
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:08,489
Is it St. Petersburg?

11
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,426
Yes, I believe it is St. Petersburg.

12
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,260
Thank you. Thank you.
I am a trivia god.

13
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,459
I am so sorry, buddy.

14
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:18,059
Beg your pardon?

15
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,832
It's Leningrad.

16
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,338
And it's my turn.

17
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:24,433
Leningrad is St. Petersburg.
They're the same city, Paul.

18
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,707
No, I said which Soviet city,
not which Russian.

19
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,214
And during the Soviet era,
it was Leningrad.

20
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,944
Says so right here on the card.
See? "Leningrad."

21
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:35,953
Yes, it does say that on the card,
because this game is from 1984.

22
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,420
- Yeah.
- I will not be denied

23
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:38,821
my sweet-tasting victory

24
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,416
just because you can't pay $40
for another Trivial Pursuit.

25
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,756
Money has nothing to do with it.

26
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:44,227
I've had this game since I was six.

27
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,298
Playing with a new edition
would feel like...

28
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,832
like Alex Trebek
without his moustache.

29
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,834
- It just wouldn't feel right.
- I like him without the moustache.

30
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,665
- You like that moustache on him?
- Oh, yeah.

31
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,705
Let's say we ask
the sultry young Shelly.

32
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,171
James.

33
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,903
Shelly!

34
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,839
- Yeah?
- Hi, Shelly.

35
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,611
Alex Trebek's facial hair...
what say you?

36
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:06,946
<i>Sine qua non?</i>

37
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,782
I don't speak geek, dude.

38
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,755
It's not geek.
It's Latin.

39
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,484
I can teach you
if you wanted to learn.

40
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,531
You guys want another
round of drinks or something?

41
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:20,963
Not for me.

42
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,331
I have a date with
my endless dissertation.

43
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:24,801
Dissertation?
Constipation.

44
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,132
Come on, Paul.

45
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,434
The night is still young,
the grog is flowing,

46
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,566
the women are scrumptious
and, more importantly,

47
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,235
we have more time
for another trivia game.

48
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,903
I can't.
Classes start tomorrow.

49
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:37,073
I have to finish
this thesis from hell if it kills me.

50
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:39,083
You've been saying that
for eight years.

51
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:41,619
It's time to stop screwing around.

52
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,746
It's time to be a man.

53
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,689
And what, pray tell,
are you going to do after graduation?

54
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,556
I don't know.
What do you mean by "after"?

55
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,427
What do you mean by "man"?

56
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,328
Good night, James.

57
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,487
Free hug?

58
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:01,560
Yeah.

59
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,528
All right.
Thanks, man.

60
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,892
You're welcome.

61
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,966
Free hug, dude?

62
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,231
Uh, no.

63
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:18,402
Oh. I... Hello?

64
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,035
Excuse me.

65
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,213
Hi.

66
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,749
Hi.

67
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,944
Do you know how to get
to the Natural Resources Building?

68
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,764
There it is.

69
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,390
Did I mention I'm incredibly dense?

70
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:42,900
And a freshman?

71
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:46,597
Well, that's okay.
They're one and the same.

72
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,003
They've done tests and everything.

73
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,438
"They"?

74
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:53,205
Yeah, the guys that
do the tests on all the...

75
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,678
- Oh, on the stuff. Right.
- Yes, on that.

76
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,545
Okay.

77
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,517
- Better get to class.
- Okay.

78
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,110
- Thank you.
- Sure.

79
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:06,991
Actually, you know what?

80
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,459
I have class in this building too.
The Bible as Literature.

81
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:10,961
Yeah. Me too.

82
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,257
- Really?
- Yeah.

83
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:15,232
Apparently, the professor
is famous in Ann Arbor.

84
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,063
I'm Paul, by the way.

85
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,967
Oh. I'm Naomi.

86
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,407
You want to sit together?

87
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,382
I don't know anyone.

88
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,750
I totally would.

89
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,652
I just... I kind of
have to sit back here.

90
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,486
There's assigned seating in college?

91
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:44,256
Just for me. I'm a TA.

92
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,263
Oh.

93
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,128
So you're old?

94
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,702
Yes. Yes, I am.

95
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,065
Oh. Okay.

96
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,570
Bye.

97
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,247
Paul, <i>bonjour</i>.

98
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:03,576
Lucas Brannstrom.

99
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,151
I haven't seen you
since that Foucault seminar.

100
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,447
No, it's...
Paul, it's not "Foucault."

101
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:11,546
It's "Foucault."
It's in the throat.

102
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,592
But it's very difficult for you Americans
to pick up the subtleties of our language.

103
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:15,786
You're not French.

104
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,192
No, I'm Swedish.

105
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:20,094
But Foucault visited
Stockholm many times.

106
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,498
Hey, I didn't realize they were letting
comp lit guys TA this semester.

107
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,730
Well, I've wanted to work

108
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,533
for this professor
for a very long time.

109
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,164
He's very selective.

110
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,368
How many times have you
been a TA in this course?

111
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,969
Five.

112
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,479
Oh.

113
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,742
That is amazing.

114
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,819
You must be a very gifted scholar.

115
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,656
Hello, folk!

116
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:50,095
Good morning
and a rich welcome to you.

117
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,824
Marvelous to be with you.

118
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,867
I expect that you're as happy
to be back as I am

119
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:59,301
after the languid ease
of the summer,

120
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,806
lounging on the beach
and so on, eh?

121
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:06,242
Back to the urgency
of the life of the mind.

122
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,176
- Yea, nay?
- Yea.

123
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,806
- Yea.
- Yea.

124
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:14,284
Many of you I recognize.
Some I haven't seen yet.

125
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,788
I'll get to know your faces
and attach names to them

126
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,450
by about the second
and third day of class.

127
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,050
- Hi.
- Hi.

128
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:24,629
And then if you're absent, you see,
I'll miss you the first day.

129
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,527
Hi. Good to see you.

130
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,031
- Your name?
- Naomi.

131
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,261
Naomi. Thank you.
Welcome.

132
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,427
Hi. Ciao.

133
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,095
I'll get over to those

134
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,264
on the other side
of the room next day,

135
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,968
and soon I'll have names and faces

136
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:42,138
and the intimate details
of the lives of each of you.

137
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,007
This is English 401,

138
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:50,885
the Bible in English,
The Bible as Literature.

139
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,220
Let me begin

140
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,727
by inviting you on a journey

141
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,660
and inviting you
to take that journey

142
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,494
with an open mind

143
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,799
to your first, or a fresh,

144
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,930
confrontation

145
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,066
with collections of texts...

146
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,077
collections which are variously

147
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,444
in the Jewish and Christian traditions
called "the Bible."

148
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,613
It's a journey into
the heart of those texts,

149
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,280
a journey into the heart
of our culture,

150
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,254
and a journey, as well,

151
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,451
if you choose to make it so,

152
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,790
into the heart of yourselves.

153
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:33,126
My name is Elliot Tarson.

154
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,496
I'll be your companion
on this journey.

155
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,728
I'd like also to introduce

156
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,601
my four colleagues
in the course,

157
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:43,140
your section leaders.

158
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,733
First, there is Nick Laroussa

159
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,746
and Jessica Young

160
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:52,306
and Lucas Brannstrom,

161
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,511
and my own brilliant son...

162
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,781
forgive me, I'm so proud... Paul,

163
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:59,790
who has been with me
in the course a number of times.

164
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:02,156
Could you stand for a moment
and say hello

165
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,889
so that the whole group
gets to know you?

166
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,662
Hello.

167
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,862
Wonderful.

168
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,201
Paul, you are the professor's son.

169
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,797
Yeah.

170
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,520
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey.

171
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,526
Got the ketchup
for the loaf of meat.

172
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,528
Perfect.

173
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,122
Oh, and I want a full update
on class today.

174
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,565
Class was great.

175
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,136
Good.

176
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:47,137
Your father is in the study.

177
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,207
He wants to talk to you.

178
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,275
Okay.

179
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:05,123
Hey, Dad.

180
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,419
Fantastic lecture today.

181
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,257
Oh, you do know how
to flatter the old man.

182
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,327
Paul, I want to have

183
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,493
a discussion with you for a moment.

184
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,571
Sit.

185
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,902
Um, okay.

186
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:29,773
I ran into your advisor earlier,

187
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,976
and I must say I'm worried

188
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,350
that you haven't made adequate
progress towards your degree.

189
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:40,289
Dad, I've been working
on my dissertation a lot.

190
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,451
I mean, a lot.

191
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,189
Were you working on it a lot

192
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:48,061
when I saw you the other day

193
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,728
going into the pub
with your friend James?

194
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,137
Paul,

195
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:59,040
I instructed Dr. Hoguefeld

196
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:02,410
that this is to be your last semester

197
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,415
of funding from the department.

198
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,247
Wait. What?

199
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:10,345
It's time for you to take your degree.

200
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,422
Dad, my dissertation...

201
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,061
I still have to look
over Hoguefeld's notes,

202
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:22,760
and... and... and I haven't
even started on Whittier yet.

203
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,495
Okay.

204
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,006
I've been kind of stuck.

205
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:32,168
Oh, son, that's nothing to be
embarrassed about at all.

206
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,973
You mentioned Whittier.

207
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,674
I touch on Whittier in Chapter 32

208
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:39,648
of the <i>Tarson Guide</i>.

209
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,118
It may be of help to you.

210
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,918
Yea?

211
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,787
Yea, nay?

212
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,257
Yea.

213
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:42,638
"My opinion on this topic
matter are opposing heroes

214
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,308
is biologically and mentally 'retardment."'

215
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:48,147
This is a 16-year-old
in my SAT class.

216
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:51,314
16. He does not know
the correct word for retarded,

217
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:52,822
and he wants to go to college.

218
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,860
This is what my genius
is wasted on in test prep...

219
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:56,950
"retardment."

220
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,427
I'm gonna graduate.

221
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,157
Yeah, yeah, I know.

222
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,824
Really. I lost my funding.

223
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:04,425
I have to graduate this semester.

224
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,699
What are you gonna do?

225
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:09,774
This.

226
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,367
Trivia and beer.

227
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,679
The god of geekdom

228
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,874
has rewarded our lifetime
of worshipping his nerdy altar.

229
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,382
Yes! I knew you'd be down.

230
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,715
Of course I'm down.
Jesus, I work in test prep.

231
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,720
I have no life.
What about you, though?

232
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,722
You're gonna graduate?
What about your dissertation?

233
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,758
No, to hell with it.
I am so sick of all this

234
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,623
giant life-altering crap.

235
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:32,196
That is the beauty of trivia, my friend.

236
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:35,199
It is trivial...
totally and absolutely meaningless.

237
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,270
Okay. So what you're saying is
that we need to do this

238
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,066
precisely because
we do not need to do this.

239
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,697
- Yes.
- That's compelling.

240
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,368
Six big rounds of hardcore,

241
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:48,344
no-holds-barred trivia
at bars all over the city.

242
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,381
We are talking hollow glory.

243
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,313
We are talking pointless honor.

244
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:55,387
We are talking groupies who
are vaguely unattractive at best.

245
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,148
Groupies?

246
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,780
Yes, groupies.

247
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,484
I foresee one difficulty... sports.

248
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:03,891
- Sports?
- Sports.

249
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,896
Sports is an essential part of trivia.

250
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:09,229
I mean, I can list and diagram
every organelle inside of a cell,

251
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:12,793
but I have never once attempted
a stuff shot in a basket hoop.

252
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,738
Okay, all right. Relax.
I'll figure it out.

253
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:18,708
This is not gonna be easy.

254
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,006
We're talking about practice, training,

255
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,808
honing our intellects
every single day.

256
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,349
If we're gonna do this,
we're not gonna half-ass it.

257
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:26,918
We're gonna need both cheeks.

258
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,987
Of course. But that's
the best thing about this.

259
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,919
At the end of the day,
none of it matters.

260
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,150
I mean, who gives a crap
whether we win or lose?

261
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:36,056
But we will win, won't we?

262
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,823
- Yeah, sure. Maybe.
- All right.

263
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,333
- Yeah!
- You need to work on that.

264
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:13,094
Come on, Tarson.
Get your head in the game.

265
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,892
Hello, folk!

266
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,903
Welcome.

267
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,370
This is...

268
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,772
This is English 401,

269
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,181
Section 12 of
the Bible as Literature.

270
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:35,185
My name's Paul.

271
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,118
And in case you missed it,

272
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,713
I am, in fact,
the son of the man,

273
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,726
the myth, the legend,
Professor Tarson himself.

274
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,895
Okay, let's get started.

275
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,993
Let's pull out your
<i>Tarson Guides</i> to Chapter 1.

276
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,537
Excuse me?

277
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:57,302
If you have a question,
please raise your hand.

278
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,372
Excuse me.

279
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,844
Thank you.

280
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:05,576
Yeah, can you please tell us
a little bit more about yourself?

281
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,881
Uh, well...

282
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,148
I think I said
I'm Professor Tarson's son.

283
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,087
No, I mean,
something about you.

284
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,183
We all know who your dad is.

285
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,784
I mean, what else do you study?

286
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,863
Do you study
other ancient religions

287
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,432
or just Scriptures
from the Bible or...

288
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,805
Well, okay.

289
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,810
I'm a doctoral student in English lit,

290
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,470
but, yes, I do study the Bible.

291
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,448
And that is study,
not preach, per se.

292
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:41,784
Specifically,

293
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:46,085
my dissertation investigates
the King James Bible

294
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:49,422
and the many points
of intersection

295
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,723
within Western literary canon,

296
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,264
with a focus on

297
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:57,529
the significance
of language and communication

298
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,104
as a locus to the transcendent,

299
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,605
while embodying complex tropes

300
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,370
and even perhaps

301
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,911
both communal
and individual identity,

302
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:10,106
which, not surprisingly,

303
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:13,412
lends itself to a vital tension

304
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,955
of the static versus the dynamic...

305
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:17,953
Sorry.

306
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,956
...as is often

307
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:23,221
made manifest in the pre
and postmodern era.

308
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,629
What the hell?

309
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,430
Hands, please.

310
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:34,506
Okay, but what do you hope
to get from it?

311
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:36,699
I mean, why do you study the Bible?

312
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:39,333
Okay. Naomi, I know
that you're new at this,

313
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:42,572
but this class is not about religion,
it's about literature.

314
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,478
That's not what I mean.
What I mean...

315
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,051
And it is imperative that we approach
this topic dispassionately.

316
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,177
- That's not possible.
- It's absolutely possible.

317
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,983
Trust me. Okay?
Moving on.

318
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:52,989
Look, I don't know a thing
about the Bible, okay?

319
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:56,219
My parents are atheists.
Never read it before in my life.

320
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,695
But I see how important
that book is to so many people,

321
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,857
and I want to understand that.

322
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,662
I mean, that's why I'm here.

323
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,669
That's why I'm studying the Bible.

324
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,238
See?

325
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,466
The Bible absolutely saved my life.

326
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,872
- Really?
- Yeah.

327
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:14,673
I read the Bible every night
before I go to bed, religiously,

328
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,747
- and I'm not even religious.
- If we could...

329
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,577
I remember the first time I read the Bible,
when I was four years old.

330
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,845
There's something about the stories.
I mean, Heston in <i>The Ten Commandments</i>.

331
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,887
One of my moms is a rabbi.

332
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,548
I just need the credits.

333
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,466
Enough.

334
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,091
That's enough.

335
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,871
I'm the teacher in this class.

336
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,531
Me.

337
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,939
And we have
a lot of work to do.

338
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:47,603
So, if you wouldn't mind

339
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,876
pulling out your <i>Tarson Guides</i>
and turning to Chapter 1.

340
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,844
She sounds positively succulent.

341
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:59,253
- She's a student.
- Oh, come now, Paul.

342
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,292
Are you gonna tell me
that you've never fantasized

343
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,224
about having a sexy young sultress

344
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,023
in your office hours alone?

345
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,155
She's got a plaid school outfit on,

346
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,166
knee-high white stockings,

347
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,202
ruffled pink panties,

348
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:14,932
brand-new penny loafers,
oiled leather, lace.

349
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,100
You bend her over your hard oaken desk,
teach her the ways of the gun.

350
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,108
No.

351
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,439
Really?

352
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:23,070
That's the whole reason
I became a teacher.

353
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,479
It's unethical.
It's unprofessional.

354
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,451
It's completely against university bylaws.
Besides, she's a freshman.

355
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:31,716
Aha. Forbidden fruit,
ripe for the plucking.

356
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:35,020
Virile, nubile, tactile...

357
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,788
Okay, can we talk about trivia, please?

358
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,453
Fine. And what, might I ask,

359
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,758
have you determined
about our sports dilemma?

360
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,356
The guy is a sports genius.

361
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,401
I went to Catholic school
with him back in the 4th grade.

362
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:45,492
The fourth grade?

363
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:47,663
You're telling me you haven't
seen this guy in 15 years?

364
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:48,797
How do we know he's any good?

365
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:51,034
- He was the class jock.
- In fourth grade.

366
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,373
James, you should've seen the way
this guy dominated kickball.

367
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,106
- He could kick that thing for miles.
- Yeah, in fourth grade.

368
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:58,114
He's the only athlete
I've ever been friends with.

369
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:00,446
Would you please
give him a chance?

370
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:34,716
Uh, Izzy.

371
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:37,388
Izzy Dasselway.

372
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:38,786
- Oh, God, no.
- Hey, man.

373
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,381
Thanks for coming down.
Long time no see.

374
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:43,393
You ready for this action?

375
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:44,894
You ready for this?

376
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:46,896
I'm Ice, bitch.
Right now.

377
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:49,626
Do it. Do it. Do it.

378
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:52,101
Uh, okay.

379
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,229
This is, uh, James Koogly.

380
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,307
It's a pleasure.

381
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:05,981
Ice will get in your head.

382
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:08,985
And when Ice is in
your goddamn head,

383
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:10,987
you ain't gonna get the Ice out.

384
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:14,081
I am freakin' Ice...

385
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,225
Oh, shit.

386
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:26,937
All right. Welcome all
to the first annual

387
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,404
Ann Arbor Pub Trivia Tournament,

388
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,669
sponsored by L'Italia wine

389
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:35,178
and Sex Candy,
edible prophylactics.

390
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,010
Sex Candy. Tastes so good,
you'll buy it for the meal.

391
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:41,552
I'm Brian Collins,
and this is my lovely assistant, Shelly.

392
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:43,553
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Brian,

393
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,748
is that a pen in your pocket,
or are you excited

394
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:48,155
to do some trivia?

395
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,286
- Yes. Yeah.
- I'm excited to do trivia.

396
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:52,829
Team name.
What's our team name?

397
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,457
I have been brainstorming
about this, okay?

398
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:59,298
What do you think
of Apostles of Angst?

399
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,565
Or... Okay, okay.

400
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:05,131
Or The Many Secret Loves
of Anais Nin?

401
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:07,905
Ice Tigers.

402
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:10,481
The name is Ice Tigers.

403
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,482
Okay. That, uh...

404
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:16,543
That's intriguing, but perhaps...

405
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,624
Right now, trivia contests
are being held

406
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:25,855
at other inferior bars
all over our great city.

407
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,864
The top three teams
from each bar

408
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,196
will go on to compete
in the next round

409
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,736
until the championship,
where the final six teams

410
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,999
will compete
for ultimate supremacy.

411
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:37,165
Oh, hey, look who it is.
It's Paul, huh?

412
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,936
You're the ultimate scholar,
I hear, right?

413
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,740
Hey, is Daddy gonna come
and help you out on the team tonight?

414
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,509
'Cause looking at the team,
you're definitely gonna need it.

415
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:47,517
Hey, Brannstrom,
you comp lit pricks think you're so cool

416
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,554
just because you study literature
in two different languages.

417
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:54,091
Yeah, that's about right.
We do.

418
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,187
- Damn Swede.
- Yeah.

419
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:00,525
The first half of tonight's contest

420
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,827
consists of 20 questions
worth one point each.

421
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:06,461
Here we go.
Question one.

422
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:08,937
"What ruler famous for his laws

423
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,338
"created the ancient empire of Babylonia

424
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:14,344
in 16th century BCE?"

425
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,641
Hammurabi. Next.

426
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:22,015
"What is the largest bird of prey
in the Western Hemisphere?"

427
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,519
And, no, it is not Shelly.

428
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,522
What about the penguin?

429
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:27,751
They catch fish with their claws.

430
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,986
Andean condor.

431
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:33,394
One minute left.

432
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:37,491
"What Baroque composer is best known
for his classic work <i>Messiah?</i>

433
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:40,696
Was this composer born "ba-roke,"
or did they just die "ba-roke"?

434
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,141
20 seconds.

435
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:52,380
Five, four, three, two, one.

436
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:55,078
Right. The next category is sports.

437
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:01,391
Ice is all over this shit.

438
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,586
"What professional golfer

439
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:07,722
won the first ever Green Jacket
awarded to a Masters Champion?"

440
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,030
Izzy?

441
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,432
Ice.

442
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,941
Five seconds.

443
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,442
Ice has no idea.

444
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:21,444
"Ice has no idea"?

445
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,605
Ice is supposed to be
the stinking sports expert.

446
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,546
He is.
But not golf.

447
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,049
Okay, okay.

448
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,585
There are a lot of other sports.

449
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,450
- It's okay.
- Next question.

450
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:33,581
"Who captained
the French national soccer team

451
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:36,923
that won the 1984 Olympics?"

452
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:39,553
- Who is it?
- Soccer.

453
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,689
What the shit do they think Ice is,

454
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,030
a goddamn Euro-fag?

455
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,401
Okay, Ice.

456
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:48,938
Are there any sports
that Ice does know?

457
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,838
The big ones...
basketball, football...

458
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,808
"What is the name
of the first Japanese player

459
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,745
ever to play for
the American major leagues?"

460
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:00,151
Yeah, pretty much just
basketball and football.

461
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,913
And kickball.

462
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:06,456
I'll take these. All right.

463
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:11,756
All right. At the end of the first half
of tonight's contest,

464
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,262
in first place so far,

465
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:16,300
with an impressive showing
of 18 out of 20 points,

466
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:21,395
we have Den Mördaren
av Kultur och Himmelak-Själ.

467
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:24,737
Tied for second
and third place, with 17 points,

468
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,868
- are the Sig Apes...
- Yeah!

469
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,811
...and Moo Shu Dork.
- Yeah!

470
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:33,907
And in fourth place,
with 15 points, the Ice Tigers.

471
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:37,318
And, no, fellas, the first Japanese
baseball player in the US

472
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,890
was not Noriyuki "Pat" Morita.

473
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,891
This is absolutely ridiculous.

474
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,392
Those frat morons
are beating us.

475
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,224
If we keep this up,
we're not gonna make it

476
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,025
- to the next round of the tournament.
- Wait.

477
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,191
No. No.

478
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,268
Men, we can do this.

479
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:55,965
It's gonna take a little luck,
but I believe in the Ice Tigers.

480
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:57,974
Now, come on.
We have an entire half to go.

481
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,738
That is 20 more questions, right?

482
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:04,144
The final half of the contest
consists of only one question.

483
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:05,147
Damn.

484
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,377
And the category is sports.

485
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:08,975
Ah, <i>mutatis mutandis!</i>

486
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,611
Don't mess with the Ice in Latin!

487
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:13,282
- I shit Latin!
- Okay, okay.

488
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:16,360
Calm down. Calm down.

489
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,361
Now, I didn't know
if it would come to this,

490
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:22,456
but I think it's officially time
for my special trivia pen.

491
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:28,363
What's so special about it?

492
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,464
Well, it's got my name on it...

493
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,600
Paul.

494
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,116
Ice digs.

495
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,354
The final question is an identification.

496
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:46,549
"Name each of the colleges

497
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:49,422
that goes with the school mascots
pictured here."

498
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,292
Ice. Shit.

499
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,262
Oh, and one last bonus.

500
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:55,764
You see that little box
at the bottom?

501
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,960
That's double or nothing.
You check that box,

502
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,696
you get them all right,
you get double the points,

503
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,635
worth a possible 20 total.

504
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,708
But you get even one of them wrong,

505
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,002
and you get nada.

506
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,172
This is all Ice.

507
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,680
Are you...

508
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:13,808
Ice, do it.

509
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,887
Ten seconds left.

510
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,552
All right. Here we go.

511
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:25,322
This is it.

512
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,888
In first place, with 38 points,

513
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,025
an impressive showing,

514
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:33,036
our first qualifier for the next round

515
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,106
of the Ann Arbor Trivia Tournament,

516
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:38,004
Den Mördaren
and blah, blah, blah.

517
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,304
Good for you, dude.

518
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,309
Jackass.

519
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:43,039
Our next qualifier,

520
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,742
in second place tonight,
The Sig Apes.

521
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,881
This is a travesty of competitive trivia.

522
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,682
There's one more spot.

523
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,122
And our final qualifier,
in third place with 35 points...

524
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:56,750
and I didn't think these guys
were gonna pull it off...

525
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:58,852
The Lice Floggers.

526
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:02,665
Wait. Who?

527
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,733
Oh. Sorry.
Ice Tigers.

528
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:08,169
- We won!
- Yes!

529
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:10,935
Nobody shits the Ice.
Ice is in your head.

530
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:12,839
We're number three,
mucus mucockis!

531
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,309
I'm a qualifier.

532
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,403
I've never qualified
for anything in my whole life.

533
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,744
I work in test preparation.

534
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,943
That's right.

535
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:32,192
- Let's get a drink.
- Yeah.

536
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,478
Yeah.

537
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,383
Right on.

538
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:02,817
Hey, Naomi. Hey.

539
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,691
Oh, is it okay for me to speak,
or do I need to raise my hand?

540
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,230
Listen, I'm really sorry about that.

541
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:09,994
I get nervous when I talk
in front of people.

542
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,591
So maybe we can try again?

543
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,864
To talk.

544
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,371
To talk?

545
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:16,872
Yeah.

546
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,465
About the Bible.

547
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:22,335
Do you want to come
to my office hours?

548
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,146
I have a better idea.

549
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,117
Let's talk right now.

550
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,879
I can't right now.
You remember?

551
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,287
I have to sit with the TAs and...

552
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:36,292
I know.
Not in there.

553
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,294
Out there.

554
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:42,023
Wait. You mean...

555
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,624
Yeah. I heard
you can skip in college.

556
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,000
Apparently they don't even
take attendance.

557
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:48,936
I can't.

558
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,268
I'm a TA.

559
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,172
I have to be at lecture.
I can't skip.

560
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:53,767
Okay.

561
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:56,279
Later, Teach.

562
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,775
According to Richwell...

563
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:03,445
Are there questions
of me before I begin?

564
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:04,851
Excuse me. Hi.

565
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:06,947
Sorry, sir,
but lecture is about to start.

566
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,457
Listen, I gave it some thought,

567
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,117
and I think spending
the morning outside

568
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:12,628
would have definite
educational value.

569
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,357
Okay.

570
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:17,866
A story which is there is...

571
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,960
It's okay.
I'm her TA.

572
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,971
...and which,
in a long family line...

573
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:23,700
Gotta go.

574
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:28,802
...right to the point
which we associate with Rebekah.

575
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:35,314
What, is this, like, the first time
you've ever skipped class?

576
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,320
What? Come on. No.

577
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:38,821
It's okay.

578
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,686
It's my first time too.

579
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:44,487
So... the Bible.

580
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:46,187
Yes.

581
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,696
Hey, what's that?

582
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,427
What? Oh, that.

583
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:53,436
It's just some crap the university does
to help the kids relax.

584
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,506
Only morons do it.

585
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:56,834
Sweet.

586
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,568
No... Okay, seriously?

587
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,702
You don't understand.
I have no physical coordination whatsoever.

588
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,247
- Oh, so you're useless?
- Not useless.

589
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,817
Look, I'm great at trivia.
Do you play Trivial Pursuit?

590
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,818
Oh, so you're useless
and a giant geek.

591
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,887
Got it.

592
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,726
Come on.

593
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,352
Jump!

594
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:19,828
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah.

595
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:22,893
Hey, whatever happened to

596
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,435
"I just want to understand what makes
the Bible so important to people"?

597
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,026
I do.

598
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:29,834
That's why I'm working on my own religion,
thank you very much.

599
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:31,306
Little Thingie-ism.

600
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:33,639
"Little Thingie-ism."

601
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:36,305
The belief in life that only
the little things matter.

602
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:37,346
Okay.

603
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:38,437
"Okay"?

604
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:41,382
Like when someone
reads you a story.

605
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,977
Or when you're taking a bath,

606
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:45,487
and you've been in there
for way too long,

607
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,023
and you look down
and you have those ugly,

608
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,592
crinkly, pruney fingertips,

609
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,558
and it makes you laugh
just like that.

610
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:54,097
Or you're busy moon bouncing
when you should be in lecture hall.

611
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,358
Yeah, sure.

612
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,093
It's not like you're paying
to go to school or anything.

613
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,999
Oh, yeah. Well, why don't I just
spew a bunch of nerd speak

614
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:02,698
- and call it a day?
- Careful.

615
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,468
Try this.

616
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:09,445
- Take it easy.
- Boom!

617
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,515
- Okay.
- Bring it.

618
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,277
All right.

619
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,512
You're such a dork.

620
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:20,522
I'm okay. I'm okay.

621
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:23,594
You know, you never answered
my question in class, by the way.

622
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:25,719
- What's that?
- Why do you study the Bible?

623
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,526
I don't know.

624
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:31,193
I never really thought about it, honestly.

625
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,600
I don't like to teach.

626
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:35,569
Hate it, actually.

627
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:38,073
Okay. Well, then,
why would you...

628
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,371
Okay, I was an undergrad,

629
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,378
and I thought about doing
a lot of different things,

630
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,643
and then I took
my dad's Bible as Lit class.

631
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,877
- Your dad's Bible lit class?
- Yeah.

632
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:50,078
So, you went here as an undergrad?

633
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:52,679
Yeah. I've lived in Ann Arbor
my whole life.

634
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:55,683
What?

635
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:59,490
What a loser.
I would've gone crazy.

636
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,929
I couldn't wait
to get out of the house.

637
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,557
What? Wait a minute.
Where are you from?

638
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:04,965
Bloomfield Hills.

639
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:06,297
Bloom... Come on!

640
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:07,894
That's, like,
45 minutes from here.

641
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:09,472
It is a really long 45 minutes.

642
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:11,474
Oh, please.
Listen, listen.

643
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:14,238
Ann Arbor is a great place
to spend your life, okay?

644
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:16,438
- Okay.
- You out-of-towners all come in here

645
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:19,414
for your frat parties
and your football games.

646
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:22,247
By the way, I've never been
to one of those games. Not one.

647
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:25,914
And I am proud of it, because there's
a lot more to this city than that...

648
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,820
things that you can only
learn through time,

649
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:30,519
through experience, commitment.

650
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,432
I could show you a few things.

651
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,468
Oh, really?

652
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:39,593
Yeah.

653
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,371
You just asked me out on a date.

654
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,805
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

655
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,243
Good.

656
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:50,541
Good.

657
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,845
And we are totally going to a game.

658
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,587
You've really never been
to a Michigan game?

659
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,622
- Never.
- That's just weird.

660
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:02,352
You're weird.

661
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,729
Next question.

662
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,204
Okay.

663
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:22,512
"What award does the winner of
the PGA Championship receive?"

664
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,176
- Starts with a W.
- Hey!

665
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:30,777
Okay.

666
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:32,515
The...

667
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,321
Ends with an "er" sound.

668
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:37,325
"Er."

669
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:38,554
All right.

670
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:44,396
Sounds like a swan, okay?
Think about a swan.

671
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,493
Swanamake...

672
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:48,435
- The Wanamaker Trophy.
- Yes! Yes!

673
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,666
You is the Ice.

674
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:53,676
- God! <i>Vigilantibus aequitas</i>.
- Shit.

675
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,712
No hints. No hints.

676
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,804
I understand that you want us
to improve, okay?

677
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:00,008
But is the implementation
of torture really necessary?

678
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:01,277
This isn't torture.

679
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:04,081
I got this from a friend of mine
in the psych department. It's science.

680
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:06,588
Maybe I should use this
in my test prep class, huh?

681
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,886
You think these clamps
would attach to a human nipple?

682
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,290
You're not in grad school, slicky?

683
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,158
No, slicky ain't
in grad school, thank you...

684
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:16,893
Wait. What do you do, huh,
oh, spastic homunculus?

685
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,464
The lumberyard.

686
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,596
The lumberyard.
Jesus Chri...

687
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:25,107
I'm teammates with
"Hacksaw" Jim Duggan over here.

688
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:26,870
What do you guys think
about getting team shirts?

689
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:29,606
Ice. Yes. Shit.

690
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,013
Oh, damn it.
I gotta run.

691
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:34,107
What do you mean you gotta run?
Where you gotta run?

692
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:37,545
Ice, you're in charge
of team shirts.

693
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:38,952
- Done.
- From now on,

694
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:41,456
we meet here every morning
at 9 a.m. To practice.

695
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,117
No more third place.

696
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:44,660
We got a shot to win this bad boy.

697
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,593
Wait, wait. 9 a.m.?
Don't you have class then?

698
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:50,360
Yeah. Apparently they don't
even take attendance.

699
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:11,586
That's how ice skating goes.

700
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,917
That I know...

701
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:33,564
We're number two!

702
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,605
Okay.

703
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,436
Here. Stop here.

704
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,702
Okay.

705
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:42,176
This is where I went
to grade school and high school.

706
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:44,338
Father Gabriel Richard.

707
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:46,746
Three blocks from the university?

708
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:50,287
Father Gabriel Richard founded
the University of Michigan.

709
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,448
Besides, it's at least 20 blocks
away from my preschool.

710
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,457
That's a big deal.

711
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,457
Come on.

712
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,790
Oh. I'm catching up.

713
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,082
Hey, leave your bike here.

714
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:29,318
Okay.

715
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,933
- Come on.
- Okay.

716
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:42,328
Almost there. Okay?

717
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,670
- Yeah.
- And this is it.

718
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,405
The infamous rope swing.

719
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:49,809
Oh, awesome.

720
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:53,148
When I was a kid,

721
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,218
I used to come up here
all the time

722
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:58,618
and watch my friends
swing out and let go.

723
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:02,353
What about you?

724
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,360
Not once.

725
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:15,834
Bye.

726
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,475
Oh, my God.
It's freezing.

727
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:25,674
My nuts are the size of peas!

728
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:29,109
What are you doing?

729
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,949
What do you think I'm doing?

730
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,283
What...

731
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,482
Here goes nothing.

732
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,689
Oh, my gosh.

733
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:46,736
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm awesome.

734
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,709
Wow.

735
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,717
It's worse than I thought.

736
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:03,480
What's that?

737
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:06,385
This is an original edition.

738
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,515
Yeah, that's right.
You wanna play?

739
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:11,424
I'll go easy on you, I swear.

740
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,157
What does this tell me about you?

741
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:16,165
About the real Paul Tarson?

742
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,895
Absolutely nothing.
That's the point.

743
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:21,597
Really?

744
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:25,936
What?

745
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,670
Nothing.

746
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:33,974
Read me something.

747
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:36,177
- What?
- Something from the Bible.

748
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:39,222
Oh, come on. You've got your paper
on the brain. It's due in two weeks.

749
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,848
I would really like
to hear your favorite story.

750
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:46,027
Please?

751
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,257
All right, all right.

752
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,280
"Now, the serpent was more subtle

753
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:09,443
"than any beast the Lord God had made.

754
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:12,351
"And he said to the woman,

755
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:16,153
"'Did God really say you shall not eat
from the tree in the garden? '"

756
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:19,686
"And the woman said to the serpent,

757
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:23,893
"'We must not, or we will die.'

758
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:26,902
"But the woman saw the fruit
was pleasing to the eyes,

759
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,938
"so she took it and ate it

760
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,473
"and gave it to her husband to eat."

761
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:37,341
"Then they heard the Lord God
walking in the cool of the garden,

762
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,575
"and they hid.

763
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:41,878
"The Lord God
called to Adam and said,

764
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:45,285
"'Did you eat from the fruit
I commanded you not to eat? '"

765
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:49,349
"And Adam said, 'I did.'"

766
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:56,396
"So the Lord God banished him
from the garden of Eden..."

767
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:01,426
"...to work the earth
from which he'd been taken."

768
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,603
Thank you.

769
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:14,246
When I was a kid, my dad was...

770
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:17,343
away at lectures a lot
and conferences,

771
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:20,321
always surrounded by
students and academic bigwigs,

772
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:22,949
that kind of thing.

773
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,223
So the only time that
I really had him to myself

774
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,798
was when he was reading me
Bible stories,

775
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:30,867
like that one.

776
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:33,369
He, uh...

777
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,438
He could really bring them to life.

778
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:39,066
All of them...
Solomon, David, Moses.

779
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:43,237
And, well, it was amazing.

780
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:48,548
It was like the two of us were
really there, together, you know?

781
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,457
That's the reason.

782
00:44:56,894 --> 00:45:00,193
That's the reason I decided
to study the Bible.

783
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,658
That's beautiful.

784
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,760
Although it's not like having his wife

785
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:33,693
turned into a pillar
of salt did Lot any good.

786
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:37,062
It's not like God
turned him into a deer.

787
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:39,260
Get it?

788
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:41,269
Deer, salt... lick.

789
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:43,271
Oh, God.

790
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:45,170
Okay. Okay.

791
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:47,368
Don't forget to leave your papers
on the chair as you leave.

792
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:49,378
Thanks.

793
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:12,234
Hello. Good to see you.

794
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:14,236
Good to see you.

795
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:15,828
- Hello, David. How are you?
- Good to see you.

796
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,066
- Professor, good to see you.
- Hi, Alison.

797
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:20,575
Hey, Dad.

798
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:23,271
What brings you to this side
of the building?

799
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:26,178
So sorry to intrude, son,
but I couldn't wait

800
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,148
to tell you the good news.

801
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:29,879
Good news?
What's going on?

802
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:32,979
I'm going to retire.

803
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:36,548
What? Why?

804
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,857
Well, it's getting time for me

805
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,659
to cultivate my garden, son.

806
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:45,633
And with you

807
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:47,636
finishing your doctoral dissertation,

808
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:49,638
at last,

809
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:53,506
this is an ideal time
to pass on my legacy.

810
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:57,737
Dad, what's going on?

811
00:46:57,848 --> 00:47:01,614
A new assistant professorship.

812
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:04,619
And with your unique knowledge

813
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:08,555
of my work and this university,

814
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,059
there's a genuine chance

815
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,994
that you could be appointed
in my place.

816
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,827
Take your place?
