- ZACH: Oh, my God.
- JOHNNY: Did you do that?

521
00:25:41,692 --> 00:25:45,362
I am so sorry. It's literally my
second day on the job. I fell off.

522
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:48,565
JOHNNY: You tried to take
advantage of a defenseless old man?

523
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,001
Grandpa, are you okay?

524
00:25:51,035 --> 00:25:52,569
JOHNNY: I was attacked.

525
00:25:52,603 --> 00:25:55,873
He went higher than that roof.
He went all the way up in there.

526
00:25:55,906 --> 00:25:57,975
- What?
- STORE CLERK: See this thing right here.

527
00:25:58,008 --> 00:26:03,080
Your grandfather just sat on it and
laid back. This guy, he fell down,

528
00:26:03,113 --> 00:26:05,416
and he knocked your
grandfather through the roof.

he does this shit all the time.

I am Rob Dyrdek, and this

Incredible fine young men,

War dogs, new talent. One of them
is about to get blown sky high.

00:26:23,267 --> 00:26:26,103
The rest are gonna get really
lucky and just sit comfortably.

- Wee Man is not happy.

552

JOHNNY: He's not happy.

553
00:27:31,101 --> 00:27:33,772

- JOHNNY: What happened to you?

563
00:27:51,355 --> 00:27:55,459
I believe he shot up

570

Once upon a time,
lived a father and son

imprisoned on the
island of Crete.

572
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:23,720
Tired of life in the joint,
the father had the son gather up feathers

573
00:28:23,755 --> 00:28:26,156
that were lying around the cell
and he made them both wings.

574
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:29,660
And they went off to escape
the island of Crete forever.

575
00:28:29,693 --> 00:28:33,497
But there's that one thing they
left out of the ancient myth.

A little something for ya?

straight up.

00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:27,885
Hit somebody in the nuts.

700
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:32,622

No, I told Ehren it was
a lightweight. (LAUGHING)

he's coming, guys.

What's going on here?
You guys can't...

Almost 20 years ago today we

STEVE-O: <i>Francis
Ngannou's punch is</i>

719
00:35:29,412 --> 00:35:33,818
<i>the equivalent of being hit
by a Ford Escort at top speed.</i>

720
00:35:33,851 --> 00:35:38,022

- Wait. You don't need to read that now.

- Did you hear something break?
- Yeah, I heard this crack. I thought it was the cup.

728
00:36:04,148 --> 00:36:06,650
JOHNNY: <i>Is that the hardest you've
ever hit someone in the ding ding?</i>

729
00:36:06,683 --> 00:36:12,522
FRANCIS: <i>Oh, yeah. Because I've never
hit somebody in the ding ding on purpose.</i>

MAN: Eric, what's about to
go down here?

731
00:36:15,326 --> 00:36:19,797
Ehren's gonna get the world's

This ain't a Mensa convention.

and you would have been done
for the day.

748

It's a softball.

to help us achieve our dream.

856
00:42:05,876 --> 00:42:07,845
It's good to have dreams.

857
00:42:07,878 --> 00:42:10,447
All right, so, somebody
is going to sit in the tank

858
00:42:10,481 --> 00:42:11,882
and when they fart,

859
00:42:11,915 --> 00:42:14,885
that glass dome is our
fart catcher, inside there,

860
00:42:14,918 --> 00:42:17,888
we have a little
bit of oxygen and a spark.

861
00:42:17,921 --> 00:42:19,690
And so hopefully,
once that methane gas

862
00:42:19,723 --> 00:42:21,825
gets caught in there,
it will ignite,

863
00:42:21,859 --> 00:42:25,396
and we'll get the underwater
exploding fart.

864
00:42:25,429 --> 00:42:27,364
- Yo, Steve-O, are you ready?
- You ready to make history?

865
00:42:27,398 --> 00:42:29,333
I'm ready to get in there
and just see what happens.

866
00:42:29,366 --> 00:42:31,702
Oh, my goodness,
we're about to make history

867
00:42:31,735 --> 00:42:32,870
with Steve-O.

868
00:42:32,903 --> 00:42:36,507
Okay, make sure
his feet look good.

869
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,275
- Ready?
- STEVE-O: Yeah, I'm ready.

870
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:40,744
- It's in there, man.
- Remember to give us a countdown.

871
00:42:40,779 --> 00:42:41,979
It's in there.

872
00:42:42,713 --> 00:42:44,515
How was work today, honey?

873
00:42:44,548 --> 00:42:46,550

STEVE-O: I know
I'm gonna get it.

876
00:42:51,622 --> 00:42:52,656
Just relax.

877
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:54,759
ALL: Ooooh!

878
00:42:54,793 --> 00:42:56,226
We got a fart!

(GROANING)

880
00:42:57,928 --> 00:43:01,098
Oh, that was a huge one.

881
00:43:01,131 --> 00:43:03,200
- Wow. They're like ten, dude.
- They're perfect bombs.

882
00:43:03,233 --> 00:43:05,936
There's not enough
methane in his fart.

883
00:43:05,969 --> 00:43:08,105
<i>The spark in that bowl
is going nonstop though,</i>

884
00:43:08,138 --> 00:43:10,240
<i>so we just need to catch
enough farts.</i>

885
00:43:11,308 --> 00:43:12,811
ALL: Oooh!

886
00:43:12,843 --> 00:43:14,211
TORY: The farts
aren't igniting.

887
00:43:14,244 --> 00:43:16,880
- We need an open flame.
- STEVE-O: Yeah, bring it in.

888
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:23,187
This won't hurt a bit.

How did that explode?

902
00:43:57,221 --> 00:43:59,423
The spark in the fart
catcher exploded it.

So today we got my dad,
Dark Shark on set and honestly

- I don't think he's gonna like it.
- MAN: Why not?

923
00:44:45,602 --> 00:44:48,472
So you know my dad,
ex-convict, ex-gang banger,

doesn't fear anything
except for like,

925
00:44:50,541 --> 00:44:53,143
he kinda doesn't
like bugs or spiders,

926
00:44:53,177 --> 00:44:55,746
cats, dogs, basically anything
that's not normal to the hood.

927
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,181
So we're gonna fuck
with him today

928
00:44:57,214 --> 00:44:59,216

No, you gotta be careful
with the spider.

940
00:45:25,008 --> 00:45:27,010
- Can't hurt the spider.
- I'm just worried about breathing, man.

941
00:45:27,044 --> 00:45:28,847
I don't even like
handcuffs on me no more.
