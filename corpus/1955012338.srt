NARRATOR: Since its
inception in 1951,

2
00:00:30,763 --> 00:00:34,400
the Masters has been
a showcase event.

3
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,236
Competition always is keen among
the huge field of participants,

4
00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:39,272
who bowl in qualifying
play for one

5
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:42,408
of 63 positions in
the match play final.

6
00:00:42,508 --> 00:00:46,479
The defending champion is
exempt from qualifying.

7
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:49,115
As usual the event has
attracted bowling's elite,

8
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,150
including Master's champions.

00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,852
ELI (VOICEOVER): My
grandfather told me

10
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:54,654
that Earl Anthony
was the greatest

11
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:57,290
bowler that every lived.

12
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,560
He used to watch videos of
him with my dad and Uncle Sean

13
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,361
when they were kids.

14
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,797
Earl was a left-handed
bowler-- a south paw,

15
00:01:04,897 --> 00:01:08,401
my grandfather said-- who kept
his hair short and his glasses

16
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:09,469
on.

17
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,938
He was square-- so
square the other bowlers

18
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:15,007
called him Square Earl.

19
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:18,144
He won 43 titles in his life.

20
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:23,282
In 1975, he was the first
bowler to earn over $100,000.

21
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:26,486
And in '82, he was the first
to make over $1 million

22
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,254
in lifetime earnings.

23
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:31,491
And in 2000, he was named
Master of the Millennium

24
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,459
by "Bowling Magazine."

25
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:37,997
On August 14, 2001, he fell
down a flight of stairs

26
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,466
at a friend's house and died.

27
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:44,771
After everything he'd done,
he hit his head on the floor

28
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,305
and that was it.

29
00:01:46,405 --> 00:01:50,543
The great Earl
Anthony gone forever.

30
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,111
That got me to thinking.

31
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:54,313
What happens to us when we die?

32
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:57,049
Are we just gone--
finito, kaput?

33
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,552
Or do we live on forever?

34
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:03,422
And if we do, where do we go?

35
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:07,627
Where had the greatest
bowler of all time gone?

36
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,228
Where was Earl Anthony?

PRIEST: Eli, we've been
talking for a while now,

39
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:46,525
and I want to help.

40
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:50,263
But maybe you should tell
me the reason you're here.

41
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:53,099
The reason I'm here-- well,
my family's Presbyterian,

42
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,667
but we don't go to church.

43
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:58,004
Because honestly it's just not
a very satisfying religion,

44
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,306
so I'm thinking of
becoming Catholic.

45
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,609
And for me the whole idea of
an afterlife is very appealing.

46
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:06,279
Presbyterians believe
in heaven and hell.

47
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,881
Well, yes, but not purgatory.

48
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:11,217
I like the idea
that if you mess up,

49
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:14,287
you go somewhere and do
whatever to make up for it.

50
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,688
And then you go to heaven.

00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,792
truly evil-- because
for me-- truly evil

53
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:22,161
is kind of a game changer.

54

you want to tell me about?

00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:26,699
No.

someone would be truly evil?

about to kill your mother?

60
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,911
And you had to make a
choice-- kill him or let

61
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:40,346
him kill your mother?

62
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,148
There's really no
choice, now is there?

63
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,516

00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,587
GLENN: Hey, Sean.

183
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,459
OK, Mr. Big Shot over here.

184
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,128
OK, everybody calm down.

185
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,529
No, no, no.

186
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,865
Sorry, you're not old
enough. -Neither are you.

187
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,867
Dude-- she's the
same age as I am.

188
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,969
Well, yeah, but you're
driving us all home.

189
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,238
I'll drive.

190
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,239
Lucky.

191
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,206
Glenn, have a beer with me.

192
00:12:21,306 --> 00:12:22,341
I can't.

193
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:23,809
I have a bio test
in the morning.

194
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,612
I know when we were not wanted.

195
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:28,614
Give me that.

196
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:29,982
Oh, come on, man.

197
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:36,855
What the fuck are
you doing here?

198
00:12:36,955 --> 00:12:37,489
What?

199
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:38,690
You fucking deaf?

200
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:39,925
You're always fucking
hanging around

201
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,094
like some fucking baby puppy.

202
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,195
Knock it off, Tim.

203
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:44,730
TIM: No, seriously, this
is a football party.

204
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,598
There's no sophomores
on the football team.

205
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:48,066
It's Rick's little brother, man.

206
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:48,934
So?

207
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,269
This turned into
a family picnic?

208
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,004
I could have brung my
little brother along.

209
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,405
Oh, yeah?

210
00:12:53,505 --> 00:12:55,073
Well, unfortunately, Tim, they
only allow one retard per party

211
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,042
and you're already here.

212
00:12:57,142 --> 00:12:57,976
[punch]

213
00:12:58,076 --> 00:12:58,410
DICK: Hey!

214
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,244
What?

215
00:12:59,344 --> 00:13:00,512
You want some, huh?

216
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:02,981
Come on. [punching]

217
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:04,383
[groaning]

218
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:07,119
RICK: You got something to
say, just say it to me asshole.

219
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,120
Say it to me!

220
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:22,501
[engine starting]

221
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:26,705
[sirens]

222
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:44,990
I'm Sean.

223
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:45,757
Hi.

224
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,125
Come on up, from hospice.

225
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,227
Come on in.

226
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,796
They've, uh-- they've
been expecting you.

227
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,599
Glenn set up a room for you.

228
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:54,433
Right here.

229
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,844
You're, uh, much better
looking in person.

230
00:14:05,944 --> 00:14:07,646
Huh?

231
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,082
The "GQ" article.

232
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,285
Um, pictures don't
do you justice.

233
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,187
Thanks.

234
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,356
Is Glenn here?

235
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:18,924
Yeah, she's with your brother.

236
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:19,324
Come on.

237
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:29,234
When was last time
you saw your brother?

238
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:30,536
A while.

239
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,137
Well, his cancer's
fairly advanced

240
00:14:32,237 --> 00:14:33,972
so he's pretty
distressed physically.

241
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:47,252
Sean.

242
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:54,059
I'm so glad you came.

243
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,610
Yeah, he's on a morphine drug.

244
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,712
And Anna's giving
him more now, so he

245
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,615
sleeps-- most of the time.

246
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,317
What'd the doctor say?

247
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,319
No more doctors.

248
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,354
It's just he would have
been so much better

249
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:23,488
if he hadn't done the chemo.

250
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:27,426
I thought he was--

251
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:32,230
He wasn't-- I mean, it's
not the doctor's fault.

252
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,700
He as much as said
that he had no hope.

253
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,235
But you know him, he's
always ready to fight.

254
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:43,041
So how's life across the pond.

255
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:44,910
God, his friends
brought this in here.

256
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:48,447
It's so big and it's a mess.

257
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:53,619
It's good.

258
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:54,319
Good.

259
00:15:54,419 --> 00:15:55,587
It's good.

260
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:59,858
So we saw the article in
"GQ" and he was really proud--

261
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,361
and Eli too.

262
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,895
Yeah.

263
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,632
So, have you-- have you-- have
you talked to your father?

264
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,133
No.

265
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,501
Just Evie.

266
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:10,769
Yeah, Evie's been really great.

267
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:14,706
She's been helping so much.

268
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:17,409
How are you?

269
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:20,545
Really good-- I-- I'm good.

270
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,847
And Eli?

271
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,449
Yeah, he's-- he's as
good as can be, yeah.

272
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:31,523
I just-- your dad stopped
coming to see Rick.

273
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:33,091
What?

274
00:16:33,191 --> 00:16:34,059
When?

275
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,661
Yeah, this last week.

276
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:39,898
You know, you remember he
did that with your mom too.

277
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:42,034
And Rick doesn't
really say anything.

278
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,606
I'll talk to my dad.

279
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,381
I'm so glad.

280
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:58,550
He's going to be so
happy to see you.

281
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:08,126
[pins being knocked down]

282
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:12,297
[ball rolling]

283
00:17:12,397 --> 00:17:14,599
Thought you said he
played in high school.

284
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,634
Just give him a chance.

285
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,107
At least he hit
a pin this time.

286
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:22,908
Yeah.

287
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,409
Hey, maybe I could play.

288
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:26,878
No, rules are rules kiddo.

289
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:28,714
Are you hungry?

290
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:29,748
Here.

291
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,784
Go get us a couple of burgers.

292
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:34,319
We're going to head out now.

293
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:36,088
We'll come tomorrow
at lunch and see

294
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,522
if we can't make any progress.

295
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:39,091
Right, Ben?

296
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:43,028
Some mechanism of the wrist
that I just can't seem to get.

297
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,497
I'm going some of my videos.

298
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:46,698
Watch Earl Anthony.

299
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:48,066
He was a southpaw too.

300
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,736
Still, Dick Weber was the best.

301
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:51,737
In what universe?

302
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,038
Are you kidding?

303
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:55,273
Weirdo Anthony
couldn't touch Weber.

304
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:57,209
I'd say Earl's record
speaks for itself.

305
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,244
And I would a nerdy
weirdo over show

306
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:00,879
boat any day of the week, Hal.

307
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,280
Well, don't worry.

308
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:06,618
I'm usually able to master
concepts very quickly.

309
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:07,686
Come on.

310
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,689
A guy like you--
a piece of cake.

311
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,424
Well, we'll see you tomorrow.

312
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,700
[groaning]

313
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,301
Hey.

314
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:24,669
How you doing?

315
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,271
[sighs]

316
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,506
Is it bad?

317
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,274
Mm-mm.

318
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:29,674
OK.

319
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:35,747
Where you from, Anna?

320
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:38,150
Lovely Newark, New Jersey.

321
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,318
What brought you here?

322
00:18:40,418 --> 00:18:44,589
I needed a change of pace, to
start travelling a little bit.

323
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:45,657
I like it here.

324
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:46,758
People are nice.

325
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:47,726
There air is clean.

326
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,195
It's quiet.

327
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,965
And it has the most beautiful
sunsets I have ever seen.

328
00:18:54,065 --> 00:19:01,940
My mom used to make
Sean and me sit with her,

329
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:06,478
wave goodbye to the sun
when we were little.

330
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,547
That's your mom, huh?

331
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,316
She's very beautiful.

332
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,553
Sometimes I hear
her calling me.

333
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,723
How long ago did she pass?

334
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:25,497
Six years ago.

335
00:20:14,145 --> 00:20:17,616
[ringing]

336
00:20:33,598 --> 00:20:34,432
Uncle Sean.

337
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:34,833
Hey.

338
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:35,433
Eli.

339
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:39,838
Wow.

340
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,740
You've gotten so big.

341
00:20:44,342 --> 00:20:44,676
Dad.

342
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:45,243
Sean.

343
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:50,115
When did you get here?

344
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:51,716
This afternoon.

345
00:20:51,816 --> 00:20:54,552
There was a big car accident on
the road, and it took a while.

346
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,721
Where-- where you
guys coming from?

347
00:20:56,821 --> 00:20:57,989
The bowling alley.

348
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:00,025
Grandpa's got the
Fiesta Cup on Saturday.

349
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:00,926
Hal's still playing?

350
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:01,960
Oh, yeah.

351
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,628
ELI: And Hal's son-in-law, Ben.

352
00:21:03,728 --> 00:21:04,629
Oh, really.

353
00:21:04,729 --> 00:21:05,196
How's he?

354
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,464
He's a disaster.

355
00:21:06,564 --> 00:21:07,399
He's not so bad.

356
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:08,566
Oh, come on.

357
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,903
He's almost as bad a
bowler as your uncle here.

358
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:13,071
Come on, let's go see dad.

359
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:14,472
You know, I have to go.

360
00:21:14,572 --> 00:21:16,474
I have to pick up Evie,
then I have to lockup so--

361
00:21:16,574 --> 00:21:17,309
But-- grandpa--

362
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,210
I'll be back later with Evie.

363
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,478
Yeah, listen.

364
00:21:20,578 --> 00:21:22,747
Good job keeping
those stats, kiddo.

365
00:21:22,847 --> 00:21:24,916
It's important.

366
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:26,518
Well, listen, I got to go.

367
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,652
See you later, OK?

368
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:37,095
He never stays.

369
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:41,499
Yeah, I mean--
he's just-- so, Eli,

370
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:43,168
are you bowling in
the tournament too?

371
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:44,202
No, I can't.

372
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:46,004
Kids aren't allowed.

373
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:47,138
Oh.

374
00:21:47,238 --> 00:21:48,640
You know, my dad,
Hal, and grandpa

375
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,476
won it five years in a row
before my dad went to Iraq.

376
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:56,414
Yeah, well-- they were always
good bowlers, those three.

377
00:21:56,514 --> 00:22:00,251
Are you as bad as
he said you were?

378
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,787
Actually bowling
was my best sport--

379
00:22:02,887 --> 00:22:03,788
which isn't saying much.

380
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,927
Do you want to go see my dad?

381
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:10,095
Sure.

382
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:11,429
Oh, Uncle Sean.

383
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:13,331
Would you mind
not telling me dad

384
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:17,135
that Ben's not a good bowler?

385
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,104
Of course.

386
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:19,838
Come on.

387
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:20,305
ELI: Thanks.

388
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:27,846
So, you know, this is difficult
for everybody, but [inaudible]

389
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:32,517
young-- Hey, Dick.

390
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:33,885
Dan.

391
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:38,423
I, uh-- just getting some talc.

392
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,025
Getting ready, you know.

393
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,259
You're still in the tournament?

394
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,861
Of course I am.

395
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:45,463
Great.

396
00:22:45,563 --> 00:22:51,369
Um. [clears throat] Charlie was
talking about maybe stopping by

397
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:54,906
to see Rick tomorrow.

398
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:55,507
Great.

399
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:00,912
There you go.

400
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,714
See you Saturday.

401
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:06,985
My best to Cora.

402
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,453
Yeah, she's in Phoenix.

403
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:12,957
What was that look for?

404
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,726
I can't stand
Charlie Cornfelder.

405
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:19,064
We had to play ball with
that idiot for four years.

406
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:20,698
Way to go, Evie.

407
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,000
He asked about Rick.

408
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:30,408
People want to say goodbye.

409
00:23:30,508 --> 00:23:33,211
This is happening,
and you can't--

410
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,846
What, Evie?

411
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:35,947
What can't I do?

412
00:23:41,886 --> 00:23:43,021
I'm going to go see Rick.

413
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:44,255
Do you want to come?

414
00:23:44,355 --> 00:23:45,523
I have to finish up here.

415
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:57,035
[music playing]

416
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:02,040
[door slams]

417
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,143
Here's mom with John's
neighbor, that crazy old lady

418
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:05,977
with one eye.

419
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:06,744
What was her name?

420
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:08,079
Miss Ramirez?

421
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:12,117
She-- [laughs] Wait, wait--
She's-- I thought she was

422
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:13,551
a witch.

423
00:24:13,651 --> 00:24:17,322
She's-- she's like, you guys
are going to go to hell.

424
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:20,024
Remember she caught
us bombing cars?

425
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,659
What happened?

426
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:23,027
Yeah.

427
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:27,799
So, your dad and I, and John
were bombing cars with oranges.

428
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,735
And one of the car swerved
and clipped her fence.

429
00:24:30,835 --> 00:24:32,403
So we were trying
to run and get away,

430
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:34,639
and Miss Ramirez
comes out and sees us.

431
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:35,473
Us?

432
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:37,075
You were the only one she saw.

433
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:39,711
You ran away and left me.

434
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:40,445
Yeah. [laughs]

435
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,680
ELI: What happened?

436
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,482
Your dad and John
were faster than me,

437
00:24:44,582 --> 00:24:47,619
so I had to run up and
climb a tree to get away.

438
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,820
[laughs]

439
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,589
And I stayed in the tree
until dad came to get us.

440
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:53,725
ELI: What did grandpa do?

441
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:54,626
Yelled.

442
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:56,494
A lot.

443
00:24:56,594 --> 00:24:58,596
I got a whooping.

444
00:24:58,696 --> 00:24:59,831
Did you?

445
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,199
No.

446
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,834
Your dad took the fall.

447
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:04,435
Said it was his idea.

448
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,207
Yeah.

449
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,176
ELI: Was it?

450
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:11,776
Probably.

451
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:16,915
[knocking]

452
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,917
Hi, looks cozy in here.

453
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,351
I've Evie.

454
00:25:20,451 --> 00:25:24,189
Hey, um, it's nice to
finally meet you in person.

455
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,324
Nice to meet you.

456
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,860
Hello, sweetheart.

457
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,661
Hey, guys.

458
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,229
I'm sorry to intrude here.

459
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:32,997
I just want to get
this guy something

460
00:25:33,097 --> 00:25:35,733
to get him through the night.

461
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:37,535
Glenn, you can give
him one of these pills

462
00:25:37,635 --> 00:25:39,370
if he wakes up in pain, OK?

463
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,406
Can we just give
him a lower dose?

464
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,247
I mean, it's just been
so long since we've all

465
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:52,083
been together like this.

466
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:53,918
It doesn't work like that.

467
00:25:54,018 --> 00:25:57,255
Actually it's way
past someone's bedtime.

468
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:58,756
I don't want to go to bed.

469
00:25:58,856 --> 00:26:00,325
Come on, go with
Evie, sweetheart.

470
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:01,626
It's a school night.

471
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,127
I don't want to go to school.

472
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,562
We've talked about this before.

473
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:08,833
Come on.

474
00:26:08,933 --> 00:26:11,135
I'll tell you a
story-- a short one.

475
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,171
Your stories are
never short, Evie.

476
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:18,977
I love you, kiddo.

477
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:19,978
ELI: I love you, too.

478
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:27,352
Will you come tuck me in?

479
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:28,553
Yes, in a few minutes.

480
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:32,523
Yup.

481
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:37,929
Goodnight, Uncle Sean.

482
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:38,529
Goodnight.

483
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,913
[music playing]

484
00:27:01,819 --> 00:27:05,923
Long ago, there
were two sisters.

485
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:08,626
Blue Dawn and Dancing
Wind, her younger sister.

486
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:14,065
One day, their mother told
them to get their baskets

487
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:18,036
and go fill like with pinions
for the coming winter.

488
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,539
She warned them, come
home before dark,

489
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:24,309
and do not cross the river.

490
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:27,912
Well, they couldn't find that
many pinions near the puebla.

491
00:27:28,012 --> 00:27:32,216
So they wandered further
until they came to the river.

492
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:37,755
On the other side of the river,
they saw trees full of pinions,

493
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:39,957
and Dancing Wind said
their mother would never

494
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:44,429
find out if they crossed the
river and filled their baskets.

495
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:47,165
Blue Dawn tried to
resist but she couldn't.

496
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:50,735
So they walked down the river
till they found some rocks

497
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,870
where they could cross.

498
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,940
Then they started picking as
many pinions as they could.

499
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,277
Soon their baskets
were fulled of pinions.

500
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:00,845
And they decided to go home.

501
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:05,616
On their way back, the sun began
to fade behind the mountain.

502
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:09,754
And it became very, very dark.

503
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,990
They couldn't find the
rocks to cross the river.

504
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:15,360
And they began to cry.

505
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:20,164
Raven heard their cries and
he flew down beside them.

506
00:28:20,264 --> 00:28:23,434
He told them he would carry
them across the river.

507
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:28,940
But in exchange, he asked for
one of the baskets of pinions.

508
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:34,612
Then Raven grabbed Blue Dawn,
and flew her across the river.

509
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,785
He returned to Dancing Wind.

510
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:44,255
He picked her up and
began to cross the river.

511
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:50,027
But high in the sky above
the river, he stopped.

512
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,629
And he said.

513
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:53,164
Why don't you give
me that basket,

514
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:56,234
I'll carry it in my beak.

515
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:58,903
The little girl refused.

516
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:03,040
And Raven became so
mad, he let go of her.

517
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:09,847
And she fell, far, far, far down
into the land of the night sky,

518
00:29:09,947 --> 00:29:12,817
where true to her name
she danced along the wind

519
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:16,888
until she found a star
she could grab a hold of.

520
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:20,358
Far down below, she heard
her sister calling to her,

521
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:23,127
come back, come back.

522
00:29:23,227 --> 00:29:25,863
And she began to sob.

523
00:29:25,963 --> 00:29:28,800
The star asked her,
why are you crying?

524
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,868
And she told him
what had happened,

525
00:29:30,968 --> 00:29:32,870
and how much she
missed her family

526
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,107
and how she wished she had
listened to her mother.

527
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:40,611
The star took pity on her, and
he flew her back down to earth,

528
00:29:40,711 --> 00:29:43,314
and landed her right
beside her sister.

529
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,753
And now it's time
to go to sleep.

530
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:52,089
Tell me the rest, Evie.

531
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,257
Tell me about the star.

532
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:03,668
When Dancing Wing went into
the land of the night sky.

533
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:06,838
She went where souls
go when they die.

534
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:10,475
And your grandmother told you.

535
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:14,779
My grandmother told me that
when you see a falling star,

536
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:18,950
it's a soul coming back to
earth, getting a second chance.

537
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,997
Do you think my dad
will get a second chance?

538
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,338
EVIE: I don't know, sweetheart.

539
00:31:26,617 --> 00:31:28,886
So then my guy
evolved to a Charizard

540
00:31:28,986 --> 00:31:30,655
which has like 250 HP.

541
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:32,456
He's-- he's like a--
he's a fire type.

542
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,325
He's a great, um, great Pokemon.

543
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:38,729
Now we're off on the world of
Pokemon I know nothing about.

544
00:31:38,829 --> 00:31:41,332
You better get going.

545
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:43,301
Uh, Evie's not here.

546
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,068
GLENN: She's not?

547
00:31:46,737 --> 00:31:47,872
I'll stay with Rick.

548
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,440
You-- you go ahead.

549
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,008
No, Evie takes him.

550
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:57,448
You go to school that
we went to, right?

551
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:58,683
Yeah.

552
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:01,485
Well, I think I know
how to get there.

553
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,887
Go get your stuff.

554
00:32:05,756 --> 00:32:08,259
I love you.

555
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,561
Eli.

556
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:13,531
I'll be here when
you get back, OK?

557
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,232
We'll play Pokemon.

558
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:15,733
OK.

559
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,201
Love you.

560
00:32:17,301 --> 00:32:18,169
Love you, mom.

561
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,971
Bye.

562
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,505
(AS THE TERMINATOR)
I'll be back.

563
00:32:27,878 --> 00:32:30,414
So, you like school?

564
00:32:30,514 --> 00:32:33,451
Sixth graders are assholes.

565
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:35,353
Did you like school?

566
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,320
No.

567
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,789
Too many assholes.

568
00:32:38,889 --> 00:32:40,358
How come you never
came to see us?

569
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:44,795
I came to see you.

570
00:32:44,895 --> 00:32:49,667
Six years ago,
when grandma died.

571
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,802
I was five.

572
00:32:51,902 --> 00:33:00,444
Uh, my business took
off and-- I don't know.

573
00:33:00,544 --> 00:33:04,281
Mom told Evie you didn't
come because of grandpa.

574
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:05,082
Oh, yeah?

575
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,920
Do you believe in hell?

576
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:14,959
Uh, no.

577
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:21,098
But then again I don't really
believe in the afterlife.

578
00:33:21,198 --> 00:33:22,733
Or God.

579
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:24,535
Why not?

580
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,738
I don't see any
evidence for it.

581
00:33:27,838 --> 00:33:32,143
Energy is neither created nor
destroyed, merely transformed.

582
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:34,478
First law of thermodynamics.

583
00:33:34,578 --> 00:33:36,080
Meaning?

584
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,650
Meaning that if you think that
humans are energy, like I do,

585
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,852
they transform at death.

586
00:33:41,952 --> 00:33:43,254
They don't just disappear.

587
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:52,063
Do you like designing
women's clothes?

588
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,665
I design for men too.

589
00:33:54,765 --> 00:33:56,600
Do you have to sew?

590
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,570
[laughs] No.

591
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,771
I just come up with the ideas.

592
00:34:00,871 --> 00:34:02,840
Other people sew.

593
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,876
Mom hasn't changed
clothes in like a week.

594
00:34:05,976 --> 00:34:08,045
She doesn't play piano anymore.

595
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:10,214
She used to play
for me before bed.

596
00:34:14,885 --> 00:34:16,120
Good morning, guys.

597
00:34:19,356 --> 00:34:22,460
How did we do through
the night, huh?

598
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,794
He's OK.

599
00:34:23,894 --> 00:34:25,296
Yeah, you didn't have to
give him too many pills?

600
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,464
None.

601
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,432
It-- he was OK.

602
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:33,037
I'm going to give
you something now.

603
00:34:39,176 --> 00:34:42,480
Glenn, you know
where the morphine is?

604
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:46,083
What-- no-- you were the last--
you were the last one to give

605
00:34:46,183 --> 00:34:47,318
him the injection, right?

606
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,189
I don't-- some-- it
was on the table.

607
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:03,601
Uh, Eli.

608
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:09,974
Your mom is going
through a tough time.

609
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:16,313
If you need to talk--

610
00:35:16,413 --> 00:35:18,916
Yeah, I'm-- uh, I--
I'm late for school.

611
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:20,451
I-- I should go.

612
00:35:28,325 --> 00:35:29,226
Eli!

613
00:35:29,326 --> 00:35:30,094
Hey, Eli!

614
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:34,799
I-- I'll pick you
up from school.

615
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:35,533
Oh, no.

616
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,600
That's okay.

617
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,836
Well, no-- I-- I'd like to.

618
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:39,703
Two o'clock?

619
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,140
Three!

620
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:47,745
ATHLETE: What's going on, buddy?

621
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:50,181
Yeah, what's up, bro?

622
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:51,115
Yeah.

623
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,149
We're going to
get pumped today--

624
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:58,455
[music playing]

625
00:36:14,738 --> 00:36:15,739
Sean?

626
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,842
Sean McAllister?

627
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,743
Oh, my God, it is you.

628
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,213
God, you're still gorgeous.

629
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,715
Thank you, uh-- Nan!

630
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:25,816
Nan, come over here.

631
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:27,718
Oh my God, Sean.

632
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:30,588
I just bought some
of your pants.

633
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,856
That's crazy.

634
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:34,825
Oh my God, you don't
remember me, do you?

635
00:36:34,925 --> 00:36:37,561
We were cheerleaders.

636
00:36:37,661 --> 00:36:38,395
Ready?

637
00:36:38,495 --> 00:36:39,663
OK.

638
00:36:39,763 --> 00:36:41,165
You can do it, that's OK.

639
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:42,766
You can beat 'em anyway.

640
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:46,070
Of course, yes, yes.

641
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,372
That's right.

642
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:51,275
Hey, I'm so sorry
to hear about Rick.

643
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,445
I mean he survives Iraq
and now this happens.

644
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,348
Yeah, um, Mike's going
to go see him later.

645
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:58,949
Shhh.

646
00:36:59,049 --> 00:37:00,951
You know, I got to grab this.

647
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:01,752
Oh, sure.

648
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,187
Sean, this is Ana.

649
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:05,456
I was wondering if you
could swing by the pharmacy

650
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,826
and pick up your
brother's prescription.

651
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:10,261
I got to-- I got to get going--

652
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:10,761
Oh.

653
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:11,795
Oh, OK.

654
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:12,396
Bye.

655
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:16,367
Bye.

656
00:37:20,437 --> 00:37:21,338
See ya.

657
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:26,577
God, he's gorgeous.

658
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:29,179
And uber successful.

659
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,014
He's gay, right?

660
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:31,815
Yeah, I think so.

661
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,450
Bummer.

662
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:36,353
So remember,
nocturnal emissions

663
00:37:36,453 --> 00:37:39,390
or wet dreams as
they are often called

664
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:45,496
are a healthy, normal part
of a maturing boy's life.

665
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,564
Any questions?

666
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:51,535
[giggling]

667
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:11,588
Nocturnal emission,
where's my history paper?

668
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,290
I-- I didn't have time.

669
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,359
Do you want to die?

670
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,061
Leave him alone, Wolf.

671
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:19,196
Who's going to
stop me, four eyes?

672
00:38:19,296 --> 00:38:22,800
We have an arrangement,
don't we, Eli?

673
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,502
Don't we?

674
00:38:25,602 --> 00:38:27,438
No.

675
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:28,105
No, Wolf.

676
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:30,407
I don't think we do.

677
00:38:30,507 --> 00:38:34,311
I think I'm just staving off the
inevitable, that at some point,

678
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:36,246
you're going to cream me.

679
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,615
But you know what, Wolf?

680
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:42,686
You're going to
fail at everything.

681
00:38:42,786 --> 00:38:46,557
And not because you're
stupid, but because you're not

682
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,726
stupid enough.

683
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:52,896
If you were more stupid, you'd
be nicer, because being stupid

684
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,798
wouldn't bother you.

685
00:38:54,898 --> 00:38:59,536
But you're smart enough
to know you're stupid,

686
00:38:59,636 --> 00:39:05,409
which makes you mad and
scared, which makes you mean.

687
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,778
Anyway you'd look at
it, you're screwed.

688
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:14,151
Our arrangement is over.

689
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:14,985
Hey, you!

690
00:39:15,085 --> 00:39:15,819
You.

691
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:16,887
Go to the office!

692
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:18,956
You're dead.

693
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:19,990
Everybody go to class.

694
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,893
There's nothing to see here.

695
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:24,928
What happened?

696
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,530
Nothing.

697
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:30,467
Eli, I know your family's gone
through a rough time right now.

698
00:39:30,567 --> 00:39:33,737
Would you like to go home?

699
00:39:33,837 --> 00:39:34,838
No.

700
00:39:34,938 --> 00:39:37,408
My mom thinks it's best
if I come to school.

701
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,376
Is there anything
I can do for you?

702
00:39:39,476 --> 00:39:40,878
I'd just like to go to class.

703
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:58,562
[music playing]

704
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:20,284
Hey.

705
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:22,486
Thank you so much for
taking Eli to school.

706
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,821
My alarm didn't go off.

707
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,322
No problem.

708
00:40:25,422 --> 00:40:27,224
I was just picking up Rick's
medication down the block

709
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:28,759
so I thought I'd stop in.

710
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:29,259
Great.

711
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,160
Thank you.

712
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:30,761
I'll go get your dad.

713
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:31,428
No.

714
00:40:31,528 --> 00:40:33,664
Uh-- I can find it.

715
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,032
Of course you can.

716
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:35,632
Sure.

717
00:40:48,812 --> 00:40:49,313
Dad?

718
00:41:09,933 --> 00:41:12,035
You tell me what happened.

719
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,837
Don't you lie to me.

720
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:15,906
Dad, please.

721
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:17,441
What did that coach see?

722
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:21,178
What do you think he's
just making this up?

723
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:22,746
Who was with you, Sean?

724
00:41:22,846 --> 00:41:25,115
No one.

725

I'm not going to tell your
mother and don't you either.

Don't you tell
anyone, you hear me?

Well, this is a surprise.

00:41:49,072 --> 00:41:52,276
Uh-- I was just picking
up Rick's medication.

731
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:55,946
I thought I'd stop by.

732
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:58,482
John got that scholarship to
Northwestern and the brother

733
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:01,118
got into the Naval
Academy after that game.

734
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:02,052
I remember.

735
00:42:04,254 --> 00:42:05,622
You know John's
thinking about running

736
00:42:05,722 --> 00:42:08,292
for mayor of Los Angeles.

737
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:09,459
I didn't know that.

738
00:42:12,629 --> 00:42:16,166
So, how's England?

739
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:18,168
It's good.

740
00:42:18,268 --> 00:42:20,504
Good.

00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:22,706
I have to unload
some golf balls.

742
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:23,373
I'll help you.

743
00:42:26,376 --> 00:42:28,011
I'm going to go take
Glenn some lunch.

744
00:42:28,111 --> 00:42:29,079
You guys OK?

745
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:30,147
Nah, we're fine.

746
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:30,747
OK.

747
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:31,815
OK

748
00:42:31,915 --> 00:42:34,084
Would you mind
bringing this to Ana?

749
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:35,285
Of course.

750
00:42:35,385 --> 00:42:36,753
I'll see you after
bowling practice.

751
00:42:43,493 --> 00:42:45,128
Evie seems nice.

00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:45,729
Yeah.

The store hasn't
changed at all.

754
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,004

You got to see Rick.

757
00:43:02,512 --> 00:43:04,248
Glenn says you haven't
been there in a week

758
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:08,685
and you just got to go.

759

You know, that's
rich-- you telling me

760
00:43:11,521 --> 00:43:13,090
I need to go see your brother.

761
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,559
Let me ask you something,
Sean-- where the hell have you

762
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,694
been for the last six years?

763
00:43:17,794 --> 00:43:20,964
Or for that matter, the
16 years before that?

764
00:43:21,064 --> 00:43:22,833
I don't think there's
much time, Dad.

765
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,067
Oh, really?

766
00:43:24,167 --> 00:43:25,602
You don't?

767
00:43:25,702 --> 00:43:27,237
You know, I don't know what
I'd do without you and Evie

breathing down my goddamn neck.

769
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,542
I was here when your
brother got the diagnosis.

770
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:35,712
And I have been here every
day since, helping his son--

771
00:43:35,812 --> 00:43:38,315
your nephew-- who you have
seen, what, maybe three times

772
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:39,216
his entire life?

773
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:39,916
It's not about me, Dad.

774
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:40,550
It's not?

775
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:41,818
It's not about me.

776
00:43:41,918 --> 00:43:43,420
You did the same thing
when mom got sick.

777
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,156
Don't you dare bring
up your mother to me.

778
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:48,659
I held your mother's hand as
she drew her dying breath.

779
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:49,826
That's because Hal made you.

780
00:43:49,926 --> 00:43:53,130
You would barely
go near the room.

781
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,699
You broke her heart, Sean.

782
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,934
You never even came to see her.

783
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:00,270
You never came back,
after all she did for you.

784
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:03,840
I never came back because
you didn't want me to, Dad.

785
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,042
Come on.

786
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,777
Why don't you fucking tell
the truth for a change?

787
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:08,745
You could barely look
at me after that night.

788
00:44:08,845 --> 00:44:10,981
And the last two years,
I was here, I felt like--

789
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:12,282
The last two years?

790
00:44:12,382 --> 00:44:14,484
Dear God, Sean, I knew what
you were long before that.

791
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:21,925
Go see, Rick, OK?

792
00:44:22,025 --> 00:44:22,726
Go see your son.

Hey.

Yeah, it's so complicated.

806
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,804
Yes, it is.

807
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,240
It shouldn't have to be.

00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:44,874
Hey, little brother.

908
00:50:44,974 --> 00:50:46,543
Look at John.

909
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:47,544
Hey!

910
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:49,079
Let Mercedes breathe, John.

911
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:50,447
[laughs]

912
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,182
Ow.

913
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:53,950
Uh, sorry.

914
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,118
He's killing me.

915
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:01,925
[music playing]

916
00:51:16,172 --> 00:51:18,408
Go ahead and laugh but my
little theory has greatly

917
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:19,442
improved my life.

918
00:51:19,542 --> 00:51:21,010
I mean, I've done
all kinds of things

919
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:23,413
that I wouldn't have
done with people.

920
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:24,481
Like Tai Chi.

921
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:25,682
Like Tai Chi.

922
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:26,750
I'm taking salsa.

923
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,251
I'm online dating.

924
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:30,887
I'd venture to say you're
a tall order for match.com.

925
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:32,422
Sky diving.

926
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:33,556
Out of planes?

927
00:51:33,656 --> 00:51:35,125
Yes, exactly.

928
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:37,961
After you get past the initial
terror, when you're falling,

929
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:42,332
it's the most peace
I've ever felt. OK.

930
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,900
Enough about me.

931
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,803
How's your family?

932
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:48,671
It's funny you should
ask about my family.

933
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,940
I think that's my nephew.

934
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,709
He's supposed to be
in school right now.

935
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:53,309
I better--

936
00:51:53,409 --> 00:51:56,012
Oh.

937
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:58,615
I promise, next time
we talk about you.

938
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:00,717
You are a great girl.

939
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:02,085
Always have been.

940
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:08,491
[music playing]

941
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:38,054
Excuse me.

942
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:40,190
Well, the matinee actually
started 20 minutes ago.

943
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:41,457
No.

944
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:43,293
I'm actually looking for a
little boy, 11 years old,

945
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:45,428
dark hair, red hoodie, backback.

946
00:52:45,528 --> 00:52:47,363
Eli.

947
00:52:47,463 --> 00:52:47,831
Yes.

948
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:48,731
Eli.

949
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,967
Uh-- He's my nephew.

950
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:52,535
Oh, well.

951
00:52:52,635 --> 00:52:56,206
He had an appointment with their
spiritual leader, Guru Sai.

952
00:52:56,306 --> 00:53:00,610
It was originally for later
today but he moved it up.

953
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:01,878
Spiritual leader?

954
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:04,914
Our center is upstairs
above the theater.

955
00:53:05,014 --> 00:53:09,118
I believe Eli has joined
Guru Sai for lunch.

956
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:11,421
Well, I believe I
would like to join them.

957
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:18,328
[music playing]

958
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:20,830
Ah.

959
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:24,033
There they are.

960
00:53:24,133 --> 00:53:26,402
Have a beautiful day.

961
00:53:26,502 --> 00:53:27,537
You too.

962
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:28,838
Namaste.

963
00:53:28,938 --> 00:53:29,439
Likewise.

964
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:51,861
Uncle Sean, what
are you doing here?

965
00:53:51,961 --> 00:53:53,162
Well, that's funny.

966
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:55,265
I was just going to
ask you the same thing.

967
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:57,500
I-- had an appointment--

968
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,468
That you moved up.

969
00:53:58,568 --> 00:53:59,669
Yes, I heard.

970
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:01,604
You're supposed to be in school.

971
00:54:01,704 --> 00:54:04,040
Eli has graced me with
his company for lunch

972
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,742
while I help him with
a school project.

973
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:08,745
It's for social studies.

974
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:09,913
Really?

975
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:10,647
Come, please.

976
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,916
Join us.

977
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:14,183
I think we should get going.

978
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:15,852
I'm not going back to school.

979
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:22,058
Today's lentil
dal day and I doubt

980
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:25,128
if you've had any better, Mr.?

981
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:25,995
McAllister.

982
00:54:26,095 --> 00:54:28,464
Sean.

983
00:54:28,564 --> 00:54:31,834
Another bowl for Eli's uncle.

984
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,504
Come.

985
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:35,171
Very well.

986
00:54:40,009 --> 00:54:40,910
I get the ball, right?

987
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:41,911
I-- I-- turn.

988
00:54:42,011 --> 00:54:42,812
And there he is.

989
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:44,047
Bam!

990
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:45,315
It was my fault we
ran into each other.

991
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:47,550
I think he's
still seeing birds.

992
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:49,285
[laughs]

993
00:54:49,385 --> 00:54:50,186
Tweet, tweet, tweet.

994
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:52,155
You ran the wrong play.

995
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:53,056
Hey, guys.

996
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:54,557
Sorry.

997
00:54:54,657 --> 00:54:55,825
I'm just going to sneak in
here and give him his meds.

998
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:56,893
OK?

999
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:58,795
Yeah, we should,
uh, probably go.

1000
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:00,863
No!

1001
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,332
No, you don't have to leave.

1002
00:55:06,402 --> 00:55:10,773
I mean, we're having
such-- such a nice time.

1003
00:55:10,873 --> 00:55:12,475
Hey, it's OK.

1004
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:15,078
I-- uh, I could
come back tomorrow.

1005
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:17,647
What time's good?

1006
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:20,016
Anytime is good.

1007
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:20,616
Bye.

1008
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:24,520
See you, hon.

1009
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:25,888
Bye, sweetie.

1010
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,256
Ah, thank you.

1011
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:29,826
We'll see you.

1012
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:30,793
Love you, honey.

1013
00:55:30,893 --> 00:55:32,362
Bye.

1014
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:32,795
Bye.

1015
00:55:32,895 --> 00:55:34,263
Thanks.

1016
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:35,098
Call you tomorrow?

1017
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:36,432
Yes.

1018
00:55:36,532 --> 00:55:36,866
Great.

1019
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:37,500
OK.

1020
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:37,867
Perfect.

1021
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,743
Ana.

1022
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,011
Yeah?

1023
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:49,712
Can I talk to you
over here for a minute?

1024
00:55:49,812 --> 00:55:50,780
Sure, what's up?

1025
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:58,621
You couldn't have
waited one minute.

1026
00:55:58,721 --> 00:56:01,157
Glenn, we have to
stay ahead of the pain,

1027
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:03,559
or it's going to get
really bad, really fast.

1028
00:56:03,659 --> 00:56:04,260
He was fine.

1029
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,561
He was not in pain.

1030
00:56:05,661 --> 00:56:07,296
He was having a good
time with his friends.

1031
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:08,164
He was enjoying them.

1032
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:09,399
I know, I understand.

1033
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:10,733
But your husband's
a really stoic guy,

1034
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:13,069
and he doesn't want you
to know if he's in pain.

1035
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:14,604
But I can assure you, he is.

1036
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:17,540
And keeping him Medicated
makes your job that much easier.

1037
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:18,841
No, no, no.

1038
00:56:18,941 --> 00:56:20,710
No, because then you just
have a nice, quiet patient.

1039
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:21,944
Right?

1040
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:22,879
It's not about that.

1041
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:23,880
Just give him the shot.

1042
00:56:26,849 --> 00:56:30,720
[door slams]

1043
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:06,789
Although reincarnation sounds
pretty neat, not all of us

1044
00:57:06,889 --> 00:57:08,991
want to come back
for another life.

1045
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,894
How do not come back?

1046
00:57:11,994 --> 00:57:12,929
Have you heard of karma?

1047
00:57:16,365 --> 00:57:19,435
Ah, your dal.

1048
00:57:19,535 --> 00:57:22,205
Simply put, karma
is the universal law

1049
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:24,240
of action and reaction.

1050
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:27,143
Good actions gain
good reactions.

1051
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:30,847
And evil actions
bear evil reactions.

1052
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:34,817
If one's karma is really good,
one can get out of coming back.

1053
00:57:34,917 --> 00:57:39,088
So, what if you do
something in this life,

1054
00:57:39,188 --> 00:57:42,291
but you didn't mean to.

1055
00:57:42,391 --> 00:57:43,526
You know.

1056
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:47,263
It-- it wasn't your
fault, not really.

1057
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:52,368
But, you had to carry it.

1058
00:57:52,468 --> 00:57:55,872
It's impossible for us to
predict our future lives.

1059
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:59,876
But we believe that if a
man's good deeds balance

1060
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:04,247
his bad deeds, his soul
will be united with Krishna.

1061
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:08,050
Is there any proof
that incarnation exists?

1062
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,486
Proof is all around you.

1063
00:58:10,586 --> 00:58:13,489
Just look at nature.

1064
00:58:13,589 --> 00:58:15,691
In the summer, the
tree flourishes.

1065
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:19,962
[music playing]

1066
00:58:20,062 --> 00:58:23,432
And in the winter, it
loses its leaves and dies.

1067
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:31,641
And there it is in the spring,
alive and full of beauty.

1068
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:39,282
This is the cruel cycle of life.

1069
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:41,551
We humans think we
are apart from it,

1070
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:43,953
but the truth is we are not.

1071
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:51,260
Oh, there's grandpa's truck.

1072
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,395
He'll drive me home.

1073
00:58:56,098 --> 00:58:59,101
You're not going to tell my
mom about today, are you?

1074
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:03,973
Hey, Eli.

1075
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:10,713
I think that God looks
at soldiers differently.

1076
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:13,816
And think he sees they do
things they don't want to.

1077
00:59:13,916 --> 00:59:16,786
I thought you don't
believe in God.

1078
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,421
I don't.

1079
00:59:18,521 --> 00:59:20,623
But if I did, I think
he'd be super smart,

1080
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:23,192
and he'd see the whole
picture and all the--

1081
00:59:23,292 --> 00:59:24,493
Extenuating circumstances.

1082
00:59:26,862 --> 00:59:27,163
Yeah.

1083
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,401
What are you doing?

1084
00:59:32,501 --> 00:59:33,836
Just getting my stuff.

1085
00:59:39,008 --> 00:59:43,346
You know, maybe I'll
come in for a while.

1086
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:44,447
Oh.

1087
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:45,414
Yeah, yeah.

1088
00:59:45,514 --> 00:59:46,482
If you-- if you want to.

1089
00:59:46,582 --> 00:59:48,417
Check out the team.

1090
00:59:48,517 --> 00:59:50,086
That sounds great.

1091
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:52,054
Yeah.

1092
00:59:52,154 --> 00:59:52,655
Yeah.

1093
00:59:59,462 --> 01:00:00,596
Hey!

1094
01:00:00,696 --> 01:00:01,631
I thought I told you
to bring me Coke.

1095
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:02,331
Uh!

1096
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:03,899
My back!

1097
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:04,600
[moaning]

1098
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,269
For God's sakes, Hal!

1099
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:08,170
What-- here.

1100
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,772
Easy.

1101
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:10,306
Dad.

1102
01:00:10,406 --> 01:00:11,073
Dad.

1103
01:00:11,173 --> 01:00:11,974
Don't do that.

1104
01:00:12,074 --> 01:00:12,908
You might make it worse.

1105
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:14,243
Tell them to go
get an ambulance.

1106
01:00:14,343 --> 01:00:15,077
Oh, he doesn't
need an ambulance.

1107
01:00:15,177 --> 01:00:15,778
It's just a spasm.

1108
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:16,178
He might.

1109
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,480
Dad.

1110
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,114
Uncle Hal, has this
ever happened before?

1111
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:18,881
Yeah.

1112
01:00:18,981 --> 01:00:20,016
20 years ago.

1113
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,485
20 years ago, you got
to be kidding me, Hal.

1114
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:24,186
What are you doing?

1115
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:25,488
Yeah, pour it on
his face genius.

1116
01:00:25,588 --> 01:00:26,789
That'll help.

1117
01:00:26,889 --> 01:00:27,823
What happened?

1118
01:00:27,923 --> 01:00:28,858
Nothing.

1119
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,092
He's fine.

1120
01:00:30,192 --> 01:00:31,227
There were a couple
paramedics in the coffee shop.

1121
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:32,194
They'll be right down.

1122
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:33,362
Thank you.

1123
01:00:33,462 --> 01:00:33,963
Listen, you're going
to be fine, Hal.

1124
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:35,231
OK?

1125
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:37,033
Guess this sort of kills
the Fiesta Cup for you, Dick?

1126
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:37,633
Too bad.

1127
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:43,306
What did you say?

1128
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:44,340
Easy there, big fellow.

1129
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,375
I'm just stating the obvious.

1130
01:00:46,475 --> 01:00:48,311
You know what's obvious, Tim.

1131
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:49,645
You are an asshole.

1132
01:00:49,745 --> 01:00:52,181
That's what's obvious.

1133
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:52,848
Calm down.

1134
01:00:52,948 --> 01:00:53,816
Dick.

1135
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,084
Don't tell me to
calm down, asshole.

1136
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:56,919
You want to watch
the language, old man?

1137
01:00:57,019 --> 01:00:59,288
You want to see what an
old man can do to you?

1138
01:00:59,388 --> 01:01:02,224
You want to see that?

1139
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:03,392
Guess I'll see you tomorrow.

1140
01:01:03,492 --> 01:01:04,960
I guess you will.

1141
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:05,461
Come on.

1142
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:06,228
Let it go.

1143
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:06,662
TIM: Good luck.

1144
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:12,435
I'll be better tomorrow, Dick.

1145
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:13,436
You'll be OK, Hal.

1146
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:14,704
Just take it easy.

1147
01:01:24,613 --> 01:01:26,816
What are we going to do?

1148
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:28,250
I'm afraid that's it, kiddo.

1149
01:01:30,886 --> 01:01:32,988
It's too late for me to
find someone else, Eli.

1150
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:33,989
I'm sorry.

1151
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:34,690
No.

1152
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:35,524
You can't just give up.

1153
01:01:35,624 --> 01:01:36,525
I'm not giving up.

1154
01:01:36,625 --> 01:01:37,259
We just don't have a choice.

1155
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,394
ELI: Yes, we--

1156
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:39,862
Eli, I know you're
disappointed.

1157
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:42,098
No-- you're the one that
always says we can't give up.

1158
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:42,765
Eli.

1159
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:45,334
No!

1160
01:01:45,434 --> 01:01:48,371
Eli, it's OK.

1161
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:49,138
No.

1162
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:50,539
No, it's not.

1163
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:52,274
We can't give up.

1164
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:53,876
Come here.

1165
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:56,011
You know I would do
anything for you.

1166
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:57,713
But the tournament
is tomorrow morning.

1167
01:01:57,813 --> 01:02:02,952
But-- I promised my dad--

1168
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:06,655
DICK: What did you
promise your dad?

1169
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:07,990
That we'd bring him the cup.

1170
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:18,567
I could bowl for Hal.

1171
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,939
I'm a little-- a lot rusty.

1172
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:26,409
But-- I could.

1173
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:27,343
Yes!

1174
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:28,244
Yes, yes.

1175
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:29,145
That's a great idea.

1176
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:29,779
No.

1177
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:30,212
Wait.

1178
01:02:30,312 --> 01:02:31,447
Wait.

1179
01:02:31,547 --> 01:02:32,982
Uncle Sean said it
was his best sport.

1180
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:34,417
Eli, we're-- we're bowling
against some tough competition

1181
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:35,251
here.

1182
01:02:35,351 --> 01:02:36,585
Well, who-- what?

1183
01:02:36,685 --> 01:02:38,254
The important thing is
to not give up, right?

1184
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:46,462
When's the last
time you bowled?

1185
01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:47,630
Does it matter?

1186
01:02:52,768 --> 01:02:55,504
Go get some shoes.

1187
01:02:55,604 --> 01:02:56,105
Yes.

1188
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:18,227
Ana?

1189
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:27,236
Uh, I don't need
you anymore, Ana.

1190
01:03:27,336 --> 01:03:28,471
What?

1191
01:03:28,571 --> 01:03:30,105
I-- I can stay till
the boys get back.

1192
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:30,739
No.

1193
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,641
Not just tonight.

1194
01:03:32,741 --> 01:03:35,778
I don't need you anymore at all.

1195
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:37,246
I'm sorry, Glenn.

1196
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:41,283
I'll be calling hospice
tomorrow to find a replacement.

1197
01:03:41,383 --> 01:03:43,953
Hey, I'm sorry if I-- I--

1198
01:03:44,053 --> 01:03:46,922
Thank you for everything.

1199
01:03:47,022 --> 01:03:47,356
ANA: OK.

1200
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:47,957
Please.

1201
01:03:48,057 --> 01:03:49,859
OK.

1202
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:50,259
OK.

1203
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:56,765
[music playing]

1204
01:04:13,415 --> 01:04:14,483
That's too much shoulder.

1205
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:16,151
Remember-- you want
to shake hands.

1206
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:17,119
You want to--

1207
01:04:17,219 --> 01:04:18,087
Dad.

1208
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:19,421
I got it.

1209
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:20,656
All right.

1210
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:22,925
I think you're doing
great, Uncle Sean.

1211
01:04:28,797 --> 01:04:30,666
Come one.

1212
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:32,301
Oh, and remember-- remember.

1213
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:33,435
We have to be here at 10 AM.

1214
01:04:47,116 --> 01:04:49,418
Shit.

1215
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:50,419
[crying]

1216
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:52,321
Are you OK?

1217
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:53,722
Did you find the remote?

1218
01:04:53,822 --> 01:04:55,291
OK, it's going to be fine.

1219
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:56,625
OK.

1220
01:04:56,725 --> 01:04:58,227
Christ, that took
you long enough.

1221
01:04:58,327 --> 01:04:59,795
Oh, here you go, dad.

1222
01:04:59,895 --> 01:05:00,696
This is a good show.

1223
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:01,830
There we go.

1224
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:03,399
OK, mom it's fine.

1225
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:05,234
Can we talk outside?

1226
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:07,803
[crying]

1227
01:05:07,903 --> 01:05:08,938
You head home.

1228
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:10,272
I'm going to spend
the night here,

1229
01:05:10,372 --> 01:05:12,007
so you're going to have
to get Janie breakfast.

1230
01:05:12,107 --> 01:05:13,475
And I'll come home early, so
you can make the tournament.

1231
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,111
And tell Brenda I will pay
her what I owe her tomorrow.

1232
01:05:16,211 --> 01:05:17,513
Brenda?

1233
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:18,581
The babysitter, Christ!

1234
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:19,214
Oh!

1235
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:19,782
Crap.

1236
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,666
ELI: Ana?

1237
01:05:37,766 --> 01:05:38,267
Mom?

1238
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:52,548
What?

1239
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:55,451
Hal hurt his back, so Uncle
Sean is now on the team.

1240
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:56,852
Oh, well.

1241
01:05:56,952 --> 01:06:00,689
That's-- Is Hal OK?

1242
01:06:00,789 --> 01:06:01,957
He's fine.

1243
01:06:02,057 --> 01:06:04,159
Just pulled his back out.

1244
01:06:04,259 --> 01:06:05,761
Where is Ana?

1245
01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:07,062
She went home.

1246
01:06:07,162 --> 01:06:08,831
And Evie went to the
store, and-- and she'll

1247
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:09,798
see you at home.

1248
01:06:14,903 --> 01:06:20,643
I'd like to sit with him,
if that's OK with you.

1249
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:21,243
OK.

1250
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:24,713
OK.

1251
01:06:24,813 --> 01:06:25,214
Let's go.

1252
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:35,557
I love you.

1253
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:39,128
[kiss]

1254
01:07:14,263 --> 01:07:18,534
We're probably not going
to win the cup this year,

1255
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:20,903
although it's certainly not
for lack of Eli's trying.

1256
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:24,406
[laughs] That kid is something.

1257
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:31,146
I wish you could see it.

1258
01:07:31,246 --> 01:07:33,749
Hal's son-in-law
is replacing you

1259
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:39,588
and-- Sean is
replacing [laughs] Hal.

1260
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:46,795
It's like watching two
giraffes try to bowl.

1261
01:07:46,895 --> 01:07:50,599
[laughs]

1262
01:07:53,001 --> 01:07:56,572
And the sad thing is--
is that Hal's son-in-law

1263
01:07:56,672 --> 01:07:59,341
makes Sean look good.

1264
01:07:59,441 --> 01:08:02,911
[laughs]

1265
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:12,588
[music playing]

1266
01:08:23,565 --> 01:08:24,633
I was 22 when I had you.

ANNOUNCER:It's not often
you see such consistency,

1268
01:08:35,577 --> 01:08:38,180
especially when the
stakes are this high.

1269
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,585
And there's another
strike for Earl Anthony.

01:08:44,987 --> 01:08:47,256
Here's a profile of
Anthony from the back.

1272
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:49,091
Notice how he lifts
the ball straight

1273
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:52,461
through his high hand going
over the top of the ball

1274
01:08:52,561 --> 01:08:54,163
very smoothly.

1275
01:08:54,263 --> 01:08:56,632
You know, Bo, Earl Anthony will
probably go down in history

1276
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:58,834
as one of the greatest
bowlers that every lived,

1277
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:00,335
if not the greatest.

1278
01:09:03,071 --> 01:09:04,506
Look at his form.

1279
01:09:04,606 --> 01:09:05,374
Right there.

1280
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:06,308
Another strike.

1281
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:09,111
Doesn't get better than that.

1282
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:10,479
[spectators clapping]

1283
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:12,748
You know just not
on his game today.

1284
01:09:12,848 --> 01:09:13,448
Piece of cake.

1285
01:09:27,062 --> 01:09:29,498
RICK: Sean?

1286
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:30,098
Yeah?

1287
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:35,470
Sean, am I dead?

1288
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:36,839
No.

1289
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:38,040
You're here with me.

1290
01:09:41,543 --> 01:09:43,345
Glenn?

1291
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:44,346
She's sleeping.

1292
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:53,288
[sighs]

1293
01:09:59,127 --> 01:10:02,631
I went somewhere.

1294
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:04,199
Well, you're here now.

1295
01:10:10,672 --> 01:10:11,573
I missed you.

1296
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:16,545
I missed you too.

1297
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:21,116
I'm sorry I wasn't here.

1298
01:10:25,587 --> 01:10:26,455
You're here now.

1299
01:10:35,330 --> 01:10:40,769
That night-- I
know it was Pinky.

1300
01:10:48,243 --> 01:10:52,347
[music playing]

1301
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:29,618
[kissing]

1302
01:11:29,718 --> 01:11:30,218
Hey!

1303
01:11:37,092 --> 01:11:41,196
[music playing]

1304
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:53,141
RICK: Shhhhh.

1305
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:00,148
Shhhh.

1306
01:12:04,619 --> 01:12:06,521
It's OK.

1307
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:10,492
[crying]

1308
01:12:30,078 --> 01:12:32,314
Mom?

1309
01:12:32,414 --> 01:12:33,515
Oh, it's OK, sweetie.

1310
01:12:33,615 --> 01:12:34,516
He's just tired.

1311
01:12:37,352 --> 01:12:38,854
You ready, Eli?

1312
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:40,188
Mm-hmm.

1313
01:12:40,288 --> 01:12:42,624
When does Ana get here?

1314
01:12:42,724 --> 01:12:45,794
Oh, she should be
here any minute.

1315
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:47,562
You, OK?

1316
01:12:47,662 --> 01:12:49,798
Yeah.

1317
01:12:49,898 --> 01:12:53,435
We are going to have that
cup for you when we come home.

1318
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:56,371
[kiss]

1319
01:12:57,172 --> 01:12:58,740
I wouldn't count on it.

1320
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:02,677
[kiss]

1321
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:07,516
Good luck.

1322
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:08,650
Listen.

1323
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:10,018
We're not going to get
past the first round.

1324
01:13:10,118 --> 01:13:12,054
But I really, really
appreciate you

1325
01:13:12,154 --> 01:13:14,222
stepping in for us like this.

1326
01:13:14,322 --> 01:13:15,490
Do we have shirts?

1327
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:16,158
Oh, yeah.

1328
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:17,726
I almost forgot.

1329
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:19,694
Here you go.

1330
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:20,662
Yeah.

1331
01:13:20,762 --> 01:13:21,296
Hey.

1332
01:13:21,396 --> 01:13:22,197
Sorry we're late.

1333
01:13:22,297 --> 01:13:23,098
Put this on.

1334
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:24,199
Go get some shoes.

1335
01:13:24,299 --> 01:13:25,333
Here Eli.

1336
01:13:28,403 --> 01:13:29,204
How about this?

1337
01:13:29,304 --> 01:13:30,872
This is your shirt, huh.

1338
01:13:30,972 --> 01:13:32,441
Eli, listen-- uh, Ben?

1339
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:35,744
Why don't you warm up?

1340
01:13:35,844 --> 01:13:36,878
Listen, Eli.

1341
01:13:36,978 --> 01:13:38,914
I don't want you to get
your hopes up too high.

1342
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:41,583
I mean, there's three
rounds to this tournament.

1343
01:13:41,683 --> 01:13:44,419
And we probably won't make
it past the first round.

1344
01:13:44,519 --> 01:13:46,755
So, we're all going to have
to be OK with that, you know.

1345
01:13:46,855 --> 01:13:49,491
I mean, winning is always
great, but your dad

1346
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:52,494
will be proud of us with
or without that cup.

1347
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:55,864
But the important thing is-- the
fact thing is we did not quit.

1348
01:13:58,567 --> 01:13:59,167
Grandpa!

1349
01:13:59,267 --> 01:14:00,469
Did that just happen?

1350
01:14:09,344 --> 01:14:10,812
You're so beautiful.

1351
01:14:16,718 --> 01:14:24,126
Everyday I would go by the rec
room on my way to football.

1352
01:14:24,226 --> 01:14:28,497
And I'd hear this
beautiful music.

1353
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:34,503
And I'd stop in the
hallway and listen.

1354
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:39,407
One day I worked up the
nerve, and I opened the door

1355
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:40,575
and there you were.

1356
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:50,485
[inaudible] There
were so many things.

1357
01:14:55,323 --> 01:15:05,100
So many horrible things,
till I saw-- and I did.

1358
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:18,413
And then I would imagine
myself back in that hall again.

1359
01:15:18,513 --> 01:15:20,615
Outside that door
listening to you.

1360
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:26,988
Glenn.

1361
01:15:31,493 --> 01:15:32,594
I can't fight this.

1362

1363
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:20,435
Hey, how are you?

1364
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:23,638
He's at the tournament.

1365
01:17:23,738 --> 01:17:24,039
Who?

1366
01:17:27,509 --> 01:17:28,009
Eli?

1367
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:38,586

[piano playing]

1370
01:18:21,763 --> 01:18:24,332
Right now is not the
time to get psyched out.

1371
01:18:24,432 --> 01:18:27,001
We are just going
to bowl our game.

1372
01:18:27,102 --> 01:18:28,970
We're not going to
overthink it. or try

1373
01:18:29,070 --> 01:18:33,274
to analyze anything, like--
like how we got here, how

1374
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:34,843
in the hell Ben is bowling 270.

1375
01:18:34,943 --> 01:18:35,577
Who cares?

1376
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:37,245
Who cares?

1377
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:38,713
All right.

1378
01:18:38,813 --> 01:18:40,949
We're just going to go out
there, focus on the pins,

1379
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:42,283
and move.

1380
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:43,785
All right?

1381
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:46,554
Oh, if you're nervous, don't
let them see your nerves.

1382
01:18:46,654 --> 01:18:47,555
Just don't.

1383
01:18:47,655 --> 01:18:49,391
You know, it's easy, breezy.

1384
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:51,960
Easy.

1385
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:52,961
Let's do it.

1388
01:20:21,015 --> 01:20:23,117
If he hits 10 pins,
I think it's over.

1389
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,211
We need a strike to win, kiddo.

01:21:08,062 --> 01:21:10,131
I think my dad's
okay with second.

I love you, too, son.

I think I'm going to
head over to Rick's.

1405
01:23:18,259 --> 01:23:18,860
OK.

1406
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,161
I'll head up with Sean.

1407
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:20,662
Hey, Bill.

1408
01:23:20,762 --> 01:23:21,262
Huh?

1409
01:23:21,362 --> 01:23:22,630
Huh?

1410
01:23:22,730 --> 01:23:24,032
Hey, I got to go pee.

1411
01:23:24,132 --> 01:23:25,633
Can, um-- Can you hold the cup?

1412
01:23:25,733 --> 01:23:28,202
Yeah, of course.

01:23:28,302 --> 01:23:31,572
[laughs]

1414
01:23:51,926 --> 01:23:53,795
Not so tough now, are you?

1415
01:23:53,895 --> 01:23:54,796
Hey, hey, hey!

1416
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:57,398
Get off of him.

1417
01:23:57,498 --> 01:23:57,999
You OK, Eli?

1418
01:24:00,568 --> 01:24:02,103
What's going on?

1419
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:04,639
This guy, he pushed me, dad.

1420
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:06,007
Did you touch my kid?

1421
01:24:06,107 --> 01:24:07,475
I was getting him off my nephew.

1422
01:24:07,575 --> 01:24:10,344
Don't you ever touch my kid?

1423
01:24:10,445 --> 01:24:12,680
Then, keep your
animal away from him.

1424
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:15,750
What did you say?

1425
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:17,285
You heard me.

1426
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:18,386
Now move.

1427
01:24:18,486 --> 01:24:20,488
Not until you
apologize to my son.

1428
01:24:20,588 --> 01:24:21,723
It's not going to happen.

1429
01:24:21,823 --> 01:24:25,193
Then we got a problem.

1430
01:24:25,293 --> 01:24:27,495
I'm not going to
fight you, Tim.

1431
01:24:27,595 --> 01:24:29,163
Of course not.

1432
01:24:29,263 --> 01:24:31,532
You'd rather have your
brother fight all your battles

1433
01:24:31,632 --> 01:24:33,301

01:24:44,812 --> 01:24:46,114
What the hell?

01:24:46,214 --> 01:24:48,850
Not such hot stuff now, are you?

Sorry, Dick.

1444
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:01,229
You should have let your
fag fight his own fights.

1445
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:21,349
Can you drive?

1446
01:26:02,089 --> 01:26:03,591

GLENN: Eli, what are you doing?

1460
01:27:49,864 --> 01:27:50,598
It's dad.

1461
01:27:50,698 --> 01:27:51,999
He's coming back.

1462
01:27:52,099 --> 01:27:54,936
I-- I saw the star, just like
in Evie's story-- a-- a falling

1463
01:27:55,036 --> 01:27:55,569
star.

1464
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:56,671
Oh, Eli.

1465
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:58,205
It means that the soul
is coming back, mom.

1466
01:27:58,306 --> 01:27:59,941
He-- he's coming back.

1467
01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:02,543
It's his second chance.

1468
01:28:02,643 --> 01:28:04,211
Eli, honey.

1469
01:28:04,312 --> 01:28:05,947
He's not coming back.

1470
01:28:06,047 --> 01:28:07,882
But I saw the star.

1471
01:28:07,982 --> 01:28:09,850
Oh, Eli.

1472

He's not coming back.

But Evie's story

1474
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:14,722
It was just a story.

1475
01:28:14,822 --> 01:28:15,756
No.

Yeah.

No.

1479
01:28:20,394 --> 01:28:22,964
But I don't know
where he is, mom.

1480
01:28:23,064 --> 01:28:23,931
OK.

1481
01:28:24,031 --> 01:28:25,866
I don't know where he is.

You do not have to
look for your father,

1485

because he is right here.

1486
01:28:34,308 --> 01:28:36,711
He is with us.

1487
01:28:36,811 --> 01:28:37,611
He is with you.

1488
01:28:37,712 --> 01:28:39,347
He is always with you.

1489
01:28:39,447 --> 01:28:44,719
And I am so sorry that you have
had to go through this alone.

1490
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:45,820
But I'm here.

1491
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:47,888
I'm here now.

Shhh, it's OK.

Hey, Pinky's on the prowl.

[growling] Why are you
calling John, Pinky?

1507
01:30:01,095 --> 01:30:02,096
It's his new nickname.

I'll see you later, man.

Well, that depends
on who you ask.

1520
01:31:03,724 --> 01:31:07,194
For me, my father's
never very far.

1521
01:31:07,294 --> 01:31:09,530
I see him in the way my
grandfather looks at me

1522
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:13,434
and calls me kiddo-- the way my
uncle tells me about the things

1523
01:31:13,534 --> 01:31:18,372
they did as boys-- the
way Evie's always there,

1524
01:31:18,472 --> 01:31:20,341
and in the way my
mother plays piano

1525
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:21,742
until I fall asleep at night.

1526
01:31:24,211 --> 01:31:28,182
For the love they shared with
him, goes through each of them

1527
01:31:28,282 --> 01:31:36,790
and back and forth to me  and
is and always will be mine.

I'm not sure if I'll be
scared them or ready to go.

1531
01:31:55,943 --> 01:31:58,746
I just hope that I see all
the places that I want to see,

1532
01:31:58,846 --> 01:32:00,681
and do all the things
that I want to do

1533
01:32:00,781 --> 01:32:04,485
and that I love all the people
that I love, best that I can.

1534
01:32:07,021 --> 01:32:12,526
And if that happens, I think
the hardest part about dying

1535
01:32:12,626 --> 01:32:16,030
will just be letting go.
