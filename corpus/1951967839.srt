1
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,560 
MagnaVolt.
The final word in auto security.

2
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,520 
No embarrassing alarm noise,
no need to trouble the police...

3
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,000 
...and it won't even
run down your battery.

4
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,520 
{y:i}Magna Volt.

5
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,560 
{y:i}Lethal response.

6
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,680 
{y:i}On the international scene, the Amazon
{y:i}nuclear power facility has blown its stack...

7
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,400 
...irradiating the world's largest rain forest.
Environmentalists call it a disaster.

8
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,600 
But don't they always?

9
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,680 
In national news,
Attorney General Marcos today...

10
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,800 
...approved the ED 209 combat unit
for deployment in five American cities...

11
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,080 
...despite widespread complaints
of malfunction.

12
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,720 
The surgeon general is dead.

13
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,080 
Gunned down 20 minutes ago by a militant
addict of the deadly designer drug Nuke.

14
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,400 
The greatest health threat
facing our nation.

15
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,800 
Nuke.

16
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,360 
The most addictive narcotic
in history.

17
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,760 
A plague that...

18
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,640 
Nuke! Nuke!

19
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,520 
This station has just received
this transmission from Cain...

20
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,680 
...convicted murderer
and leader of the Nuke cult.

21
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,160 
The people want paradise.

22
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,800 
And they will have it.

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,240 
{y:i}The assassination is the latest
{y:i}act of terrorism by Cain...

24
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,080 
{y:i}... following the bombing
{y:i}of a drug treatment clinic that left five dead.

25
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,920 
After the latest breakdown in negotiations,
Detroit's police returned to the picket line...

26
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,680 
...demanding better terms from
Omni Consumer Products, OCP...

27
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,720 
...the corporation contracted by the city
to run the police department.

28
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,320 
OCP cut our salaries 40 percent
and canceled our pensions.

29
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,160 
Now they refuse to even talk to us.

30
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,480 
God knows why,
but they want this strike.

31
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,520 
What happened?

32
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,960 
Get up!

33
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,560 
- Hold him!
- You put my eye out, you bitches!

34
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,720 
Shut up, you fuckhead!

35
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,280 
- You're breaking my fucking arm!
- Hurry!

36
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,240 
Look at this. What a nasty man.

37
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,280 
Night's made. Let's pay Papa
and get us what we need.

38
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,240 
Nuke me, baby!

39
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,280 
- I'll kill you bitches!
- He's up! Come on!

40
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,520 
- You're shit with a timer, man!
- Come on! Let's go!

41
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,600 
I'll take out an army with this shit!

42
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,480 
Let's load up
and get the hell out of here!

43
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,840 
Where's the bullets for this gun, man?

44
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,880 
Third drawer, bottom.

45
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,800 
We should've brought a truck!

46
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,520 
I really like this gun, man.

47
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,200 
Just take it and get out.

48
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,680 
Thanks.

49
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,160 
- I don't believe this!
- What?

50
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,080 
- It's the cops, man.
- Cops are on strike, stupid.

51
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,240 
Can't you hear that?

52
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,840 
- See. What did I tell you?
- I'll fix him.

53
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,000 
Did you see that? We got him!

54
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,200 
- Beautiful. Come on, man. Let's move it.
- No. One more!

55
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,400 
Nice shit, man.

56
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,040 
Fucking cops!

57
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,400 
Peace officer.

58
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,920 
Think it over, creep.

59
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,560 
Nuke.

60
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,080 
It's not mine, man.

61
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,480 
Where is it made?

62
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,720 
It's not mine, man. I told you! I'm clean!

63
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,280 
Where is it made?

64
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,800 
I don't know, man!
All I know is where I get it!

65
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,880 
Freeze.

66
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,920 
Nobody move. This is a bust.

67
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,840 
Ladies, stay down.

68
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,800 
Somebody! Open the fridge, damn it!

69
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,200 
Come on!

70
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,280 
Can't shoot a kid, can you, fucker?

71
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,240 
{y:i}Can't shoot a kid...

72
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,560 
{y:i}Throw it home, Dad!

73
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,960 
Shut up!

74
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,400 
Drop it or the little shit's dead!
I'll blow its fucking head off, man!

75
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,240 
Lewis...

76
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,240 
...hang it up.

77
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,760 
Now, no shit from either one of you!

78
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,960 
- And don't try to follow me!
- We won't.

79
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,640 
The baby's going with me!

80
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,640 
I'll kill it, man. I'll do it. I'll fucking kill it!

81
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,080 
We can't have that.

82
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,840 
Nice shooting.

83
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,880 
See you, Jimmy.

84
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,160 
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

85
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,080 
Don't do it! No! Stop... Stop it, Alex!

86
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,360 
{y:i}OCP defines you as a machine...

87
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,840 
...that utilizes some living tissue.
You understand that.

88
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,920 
Yes.

89
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,440 
And so do you
consider yourself human?

90
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,600 
I require an answer.

91
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,320 
Stop tape.

92
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,440 
You have any idea what you're doing
to that poor woman?

93
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,480 
Take a look at her file.

94
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,080 
Go on.

95
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,240 
Officer, Mrs. Murphy
is bringing suit against OCP.

96
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,040 
My name is Tom Delaney.
I'm representing her.

97
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,440 
Up to a few months ago,
she wouldn't leave her bedroom.

98
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,440 
Then there were hypnotists
and harmonic treatments.

99
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,560 
Then you pull this shit!
Driving past her house day after day.

100
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,240 
Spying on her. Trying to make her
think her husband is still alive.

101
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,240 
She's barely started
to accept the loss.

102
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,720 
- You're ripping her to pieces.
- And for what?

103
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,160 
Do you think you could ever be
a husband to her?

104
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,960 
I mean, what can you offer her?

105
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,160 
Companionship?

106
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,600 
Love?

107
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,720 
A man's love?

108
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,760 
No.

109
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,120 
Roll tape.

110
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,760 
Are you Alex Murphy?

111
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,760 
No.

112
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,280 
Are you human?

113
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,960 
No.

114
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,720 
You are simply a machine.

115
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,120 
I am...

116
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,360 
...a machine.

117
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,400 
Nothing more.

118
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,840 
Nothing more.

119
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,560 
That'll do it. Stop tape.

120
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,520 
Now, you stay there.
All right, go get her.

121
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,840 
Let's be decent about this.
Give them some privacy.

122
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,880 
I don't have a problem with that.

123
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,680 
Alex?

124
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,040 
Don't you know me?

125
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,760 
Don't you remember me?

126
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,400 
Alex, it doesn't matter
what they've done to you...

127
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,560 
Touch me.

128
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,440 
It's cold.

129
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,280 
They made this...

130
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,240 
...to honor him.

131
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,840 
- No, l...
- Your husband is dead.

132
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,080 
I don't know you.

133
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,480 
Why is this happening?

134
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,480 
I thought all communication systems
were the same.

135
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,800 
I tried to save the company
a few bucks.

136
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,520 
It took two days to download specs
from Cleveland.

137
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,280 
I lost the account.

138
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,360 
It hardly befits my dignity
to have to come to you, Johnson.

139
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,200 
Sorry for the slight inconvenience,
Your Honor.

140
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,640 
Twenty minutes in rush hour isn't slight.

141
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,840 
Not when you're mayor of a major city!

142
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,640 
When will you start paying the cops
so they'll go back to work?

143
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,560 
We're not a charity.

144
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,960 
The city owes us over $37 million.

145
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,640 
- You'll have to cut us some slack.
- A deadline's a deadline. Sorry.

146
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,280 
How are we supposed to raise
that kind of money?

147
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,160 
You aren't.

148
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,280 
- What the hell is he talking about?
- We don't expect you to pay.

149
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,680 
Let me refer you to our contract.

150
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,040 
"In the event of default...

151
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,920 
...OCP shall have the uncontested right
of foreclosure on all city assets."

152
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,960 
You signed this.

153
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,920 
We miss one payment,
and you can foreclose?

154
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,920 
We can and we will.

155
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,480 
We're taking Detroit private.

156
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,240 
So you deliberately undermined
our credit.

157
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,600 
That was the easy part.

158
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,920 
And you engineered the police strike.

159
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,320 
You want Detroit to tear itself apart...

160
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,480 
...so you can raid it like you would
any other corporation!

161
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,680 
Do you know how many people
are dying?

162
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,120 
You're murderers!

163
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,200 
I'd advise you to say nothing further.
It might be...

164
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,600 
...actionable.

165
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,360 
It's bullshit!

166
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,720 
- Bullshit, you senile, old bastard!
- All right, calm down.

167
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,960 
- We better get out of here.
- I'm okay!

168
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,200 
- Calm down. We better leave.
- I'm calm.

169
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,520 
- Calm down. Easy.
- I'm okay.

170
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,000 
All right, good.

171
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,160 
- I'm in control. Everything is fine. It's okay.
- Relax.

172
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,320 
I'm fine.

173
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,440 
One last thing, gentlemen.

174
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,280 
We will sue your asses.

175
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,320 
Give it your best shot.

176
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,200 
Fuck you, you old, senile bastard!
This is bullshit!

177
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,000 
Fuck you!

178
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,680 
- This is bullshit!
- Calm down.

179
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,480 
I've been very patient, Johnson.
Five months.

180
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,440 
- Who's that?
- That's Dr. Juliette Faxx.

181
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,160 
Just moved up to head the
Attitude Adjustment team.

182
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,280 
Five months. Ninety million dollars!

183
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,160 
- I want to see some results.
- Yes, sir. I'll show you what we have.

184
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,600 
{y:i}OCP pioneered cyborg technology.

185
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,440 
{y:i}And now we take
{y:i}a quantum leap forward.

186
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,840 
{y:i}State-of-the-art
{y:i}destructive capabilities...

187
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,760 
{y:i}... commanded by a unique combination
{y:i}of software and organic systems.

188
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,360 
{y:i}In every way,
{y:i}an improvement over the original.

189
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,080 
{y:i}It gives me great pleasure
{y:i}to introduce to you, Robocop 2.

190
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,840 
{y:i}You are under arrest.

191
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,600 
{y:i}Stop or I'll shoot.

192
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,240 
{y:i}Stop or I'll shoot.

193
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,200 
{y:i}OCP is proud to present the future
{y:i}of urban pacification:

194
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,040 
{y:i}Robocop 2.

195
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,760 
Ninety million.

196
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,040 
They all go crazy.

197
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,600 
Robots with emotional problems.

198
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,200 
No, sir, not robots, cyborgs.

199
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,640 
Cybernetic organisms. We use living human
tissue and that's our whole problem.

200
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,880 
The candidates were all fine men,
respected police officers.

201
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,040 
I reviewed their files myself.

202
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,640 
Sir, police officers may not be
the best candidates for our purposes.

203
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,440 
They're a physical bunch.
They're macho, body-proud.

204
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,080 
Stripped of all that it's no wonder
they become suicidal.

205
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,440 
Our one success was a cop.

206
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,080 
Well, yes, Mr. Johnson. Alex Murphy.

207
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,200 
Top of his class,
devout Irish Catholic, family man.

208
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,560 
Everything in his profile
indicates a fierce sense of duty.

209
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,560 
That's probably what kept him alive.

210
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,480 
With due respect, Dr. Faxx,
your area of expertise is psychology.

211
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,960 
Not robotics.

212
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,280 
There's no harm in hearing
the young lady out, is there?

213
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,640 
No, sir.

214
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,760 
Thank you, sir. I believe that Murphy's case
was unusual but not unique.

215
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,440 
We can find someone else, someone
to whom the prospect might even be...

216
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,000 
...desirable.

217
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,320 
I've never met anyone who wanted
to be a robot.

218
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,440 
It would require a screening process,
one I'd would be happy to supervise.

219
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,280 
The cost would be negligible.

220
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,960 
It would be a shame
to waste all the work that's been done.

221
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,960 
It certainly would.

222
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,120 
Go to it. Report to me directly.

223
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,840 
Yes, sir.

224
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,760 
You could learn a thing or two
from that girl, Johnson.

225
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,440 
- Not for me!

226
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,680 
Decent pay to decent cops!

227
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,880 
Union's got a list!
We ain't forgetting who you are!

228
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,520 
One at a time!

229
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,360 
Please, one at a time.

230
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,400 
Don't you know
what's going on out here?

231
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,320 
It's the best we can do!

232
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,800 
Hello, ladies!

233
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,800 
They won't be fucking
with any more cops!

234
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,520 
They won't be fucking
with nobody, man!

235
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,000 
Hob. That's him.

236
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,800 
Thank you.

237
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,400 
Nuke me!

238
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,320 
Go ahead. Take two.

239
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,360 
There's plenty of Nuke to go around.

240
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,640 
I've lost him.

241
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,600 
You haven't been around in a while.

242
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,920 
Go ahead. This one's on me.

243
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,440 
Five degrees south-southwest.

244
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,840 
There's the little darling.

245
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,440 
Good eyes, Murphy.

246
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,680 
Good as money can buy.

247
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,600 
Ferdy, you got out.

248
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,120 
Well, I'll tell Cain, okay?

249
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,000 
Better have something
to give me this time, officer.

250
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,360 
One cop per car.
Okay, these are the routes.

251
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,040 
Three cars.

252
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,000 
- One cop per car?
- That's right.

253
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,440 
Sitting ducks. We set up three
snipers and that's all it takes.

254
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,360 
- Pay the man.
- All right.

255
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,800 
Thank you.

256
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,080 
- You didn't count it.
- That's all right.

257
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,320 
You should really count it, you know.

258
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,840 
It's okay.

259
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,040 
Give him something
to help him with his conscience.

260
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,640 
No, that's all right. I don't really want it.

261
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,160 
Come on, Duffy. I know you need it.

262
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,560 
Isn't this a school day?

263
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,320 
Cops!

264
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,560 
Oh, shit!

265
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,760 
Oh, no.

266
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,800 
Freeze!

267
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,040 
Turn around. Put your hands up.

268
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,720 
Shit.

269
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,800 
Officer Duffy, have a seat.

270
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,760 
You look a little out of breath, bitch.

271
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:45,640 
- You sold us out, Officer Duffy.
- What are you talking about, Murph?

272
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,520 
Where is Cain?

273
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,360 
I don't know any Cain.

274
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,600 
Where is Cain?

275
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,160 
I don't know.

276
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,560 
Where is Cain?!

277
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,200 
I told you, I don't know!

278
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,760 
Where?

279
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,480 
River Rouge. The old sludge plant.

280
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,040 
You're a rotten cop.

281
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,840 
Go.

282
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,280 
- You.
- You want me?

283
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,120 
Dead or alive.

284
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,320 
Then one of us must die.

285
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,800 
Dead, then.

286
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,400 
Jesus...

287
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,600 
...had days like this.

288
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,520 
Hounded and attacked like a criminal.

289
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,960 
But like him, I don't blame you.

290
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,680 
They program you, and you do it.

291
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,080 
- I will kill you.
- Oh, you just tried.

292
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,960 
And...

293
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,440 
...I forgive you.

294
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,040 
Why'd you stop? You got it cracked.

295
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,400 
I'm tired.

296
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,400 
They say he's got a brain.
I want to see it.

297
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,720 
You think it was me that beat you?

298
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,880 
It wasn't.

299
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,760 
It was this.

300
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,880 
It's too tough.

301
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,480 
Try here at the joint.

302
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,640 
Yeah!

303
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,800 
Look at that!

304
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,520 
Come on. Cut it out.

305
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,440 
How's it taste?

306
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,200 
What the hell's going on?!

307
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,280 
Man, just look at him.

308
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,200 
Christ, he's been stripped.

309
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,920 
Let's not get carried away here.
We're talking about a piece of equipment.

310
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,360 
Don't tell me he can't suffer.

311
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,640 
Just look at him.

312
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,360 
It's electrical.

313
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,240 
Bullshit.

314
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,360 
I know every inch of him.
Every circuit.

315
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,520 
Every living nerve.

316
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,640 
His pain centers are alive.
They're lit up like Christmas trees.

317
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,680 
The back-up generator's
just making him twitch.

318
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,400 
He's suffering.

319
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,480 
How long can he last?

320
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,360 
No way of knowing.

321
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,200 
Got him on minimal life support.

322
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,400 
Keeping the brain going
with microshocks.

323
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,240 
- It's damn tricky. He could go anytime.
- Move. Move!

324
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,360 
What's happening in here?

325
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,000 
OCP is happening. These bastards
won't lift a finger to help him.

326
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,080 
This unit needs
millions of dollars in parts.

327
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,240 
You can't expect authorization for that
kind of cash overnight. Be reasonable.

328
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,200 
If you don't fix him, it's murder.

329
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,200 
Settle down. I'm doing you
a favor by talking to you.

330
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,960 
You son of a bitch. He's in hell.

331
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,640 
Fix him!

332
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,640 
We'll be in touch.

333
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,920 
Oh, man, you guys are the greatest!

334
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,080 
Did you see their faces?

335
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,400 
"We're gonna throw away
the key, Duffy."

336
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,600 
The cops didn't give you trouble,
did they?

337
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,520 
The usual shit from Reed.
They'll never prove anything.

338
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,280 
Hey, want some?

339
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,880 
Hey, I'm a minor.
Don't want to break any laws.

340
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,440 
Here, you take it.

341
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,960 
God, I just love you guys!

342
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,120 
What happened?

343
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,360 
Hey, where we going?

344
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,080 
Hey, come on, guys.
This isn't funny, man.

345
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,960 
Oh, God, my head.

346
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,360 
My head is killing me.

347
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,320 
Hey, man. What's?

348
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,920 
Hey, Cain! Hey, it's good to see you.

349
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,720 
Thanks for getting me out.

350
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,840 
- I can't get up.
- You noticed that one.

351
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,560 
- Cain, I don't know what the kid told you...
- You told them, Duffy.

352
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,080 
- You told them where we were.
- That's not true.

353
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:12,000 
- We know all about it, Duffy.
- You think you're the only cop we have?

354
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,240 
Oh, shit!

355
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,080 
Cain. Cain, come on.
Man, I'm begging you, man!

356
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,600 
Look, I'll do anything!

357
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,760 
Okay. You're kidding, right?
Yeah, you're just kidding.

358
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,000 
You scared me.
You taught me a lesson, man.

359
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,440 
I'd never fuck with you,
because I really love you guys.

360
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,600 
- I really do!
- Shut up!

361
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,040 
I've been loyal. I know shit
that I still haven't even told you, Cain!

362
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,560 
You deserve this, Duffy.
Cain might have been killed.

363
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,080 
Okay. Okay.

364
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,960 
Maybe you ought to have the kid leave.

365
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,400 
- Why?
- What do you mean, "have the kid leave"?

366
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,240 
That's a good touch. That's a good touch.
"Have the kid leave."

367
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,920 
That's good. "Have the kid leave." Why?

368
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,160 
Come on. It's over.

369
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,760 
Come on, Cain! Come on, man.
What are you doing?

370
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,960 
Come on!

371
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,600 
You said you were
just gonna scare him!

372
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,760 
Doesn't he look scared?

373
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,240 
I can't believe you'd do this.

374
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,400 
It hardly matters what you believe,
Mr. Schenk.

375
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,400 
But these are criminals.
They're maniacs.

376
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,600 
You're giving premature
value judgments.

377
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,400 
All right, it may be true.
The subjects are socially misaligned.

378
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,520 
Socially misaligned?
These are death row inmates!

379
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:06,280 
And of no use to society. We need a
subject who'll welcome the power...

380
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,320 
...the virtual immortality we offer.

381
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,280 
Now, I really think this is a good place
to start looking.

382
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,080 
- You're out of your mind.
- Is that your professional opinion?

383
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,120 
Yes, goddamn it, it is! Yes!

384
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,720 
And you are not using my lab to put
that kind of a brain into my cyborg.

385
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,760 
We'd dearly miss you here.

386
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,280 
You're the one that's gonna be
out of a job.

387
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,840 
I'm going to take this directly
to Johnson.

388
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,680 
He's just been waiting for an excuse
to get you fired.

389
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,240 
Good morning, sir.

390
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,760 
I'm sorry to bother you this early.

391
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,640 
You seem agitated.

392
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,080 
Frankly, I'm shocked.

393
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,160 
Mr. Schenk just called.

394
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:05,000 
Dr. Faxx has begun screening
candidates for the Robocop 2 project...

395
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,840 
So I understand. It's very exciting.

396
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:12,000 
She's screening psychotics, sir.
Murderers.

397
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,080 
We aren't planning to build a toy,
Johnson.

398
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,680 
Faxx knows what she's doing.

399
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,640 
She's keeping Robocop offline.
It's a public-relations disaster.

400
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,680 
You've got to learn to look
at the larger picture. The foreclosure.

401
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,960 
You must know how important
that is to us.

402
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,000 
With Robocop out of commission, the
chaos down there will increase...

403
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,840 
...and the odds the city will fall
into our hands.

404
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:38,640 
But a competent executive would find a way
to deal with the corporate image problem.

405
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,400 
Couldn't agree with you more,
Mr. Johnson.

406
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,640 
Fortunately, I have found a way.

407
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,320 
Yes, Ms. Faxx and I have
already discussed it.

408
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:53,200 
I know you'll help
to implement her ideas.

409
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,240 
Of course, sir. Whatever I can do.

410
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,680 
Anything else?

411
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,920 
- Coffee?
- No, thank you.

412
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,800 
Don't forget your shoes
on the way out.

413
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,480 
He's my patient and critical.
I must stay with him.

414
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,480 
We'll let you know when we need you.

415
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,720 
Nobody on your staff has my experience
with him. You need me.

416
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,400 
We don't need anybody.

417
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,800 
"We." Who the hell are "we"?
You're a lawyer who knows nothing!

418
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,720 
You're exactly this far
from getting fired, babe.

419
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,120 
Shyster!

420
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,960 
He's one of mine.

421
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,640 
I want him back on his feet.

422
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,440 
Maybe he will be,
or maybe we'll just sell the parts for scrap.

423
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,320 
That's up to us.

424
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,880 
You see, Robocop's off warranty.

425
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,280 
Robocop's command program...

426
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,840 
...his set of directives...

427
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,320 
It determines his behavior.
It's time to update the program...

428
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,120 
...and I would like to hear
from each one of you.

429
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,480 
It's about time they asked us.

430
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,720 
We're getting a lot of heat
from parents' groups.

431
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,160 
Personally, I don't blame them.
I'm a parent.

432
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,440 
All that destructive behavior.

433
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,640 
He's become a role model
for our children.

434
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,400 
- Now, what are we teaching them?
- You have a point.

435
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,840 
If he talked things out with people
instead of firing that gun.

436
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,840 
Couldn't he take a little time
to address environmental issues?

437
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,080 
What was that?

438
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,640 
He could speak out
on environmental issues.

439
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,280 
Don't see any reason why not.

440
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,080 
For all the shooting he does...

441
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,520 
...l've never once seen him take the time
to do anything nice...

442
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,080 
...like visit an orphanage.
- You're absolutely right.

443
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,800 
Or help a cat out of a tree...

444
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,680 
...or go door to door collecting
for the Red Cross...

445
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,520 
...or maybe even roasting some
marshmallows with some Cub Scouts.

446
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:20,040 
Why, Mr. Johnson, that is wonderful.
Thank you so much.

447
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,440 
- It's no good. The program isn't uploading.
- He's resisting.

448
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,880 
There's too much data.

449
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,200 
- No, it's him. Leave him to me, Schenk.
- I can't... It's not going to work!

450
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,320 
You're wasting valuable time.

451
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,360 
- Don't resist us.
- Let me up.

452
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,840 
I must go.

453
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,000 
Go where?

454
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:51,760 
Do what? Go dancing? Fall in love?
What is it you think you are?

455
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,960 
Alex Murphy.

456
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,960 
That's a delusion.

457
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,160 
It's a glitch in your system.
Alex Murphy is dead.

458
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:04,920 
Take away the metal and wires,
you're just a couple chunks on a table.

459
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,160 
You're not even a corpse.

460
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,960 
What are you?

461
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,840 
Respond.

462
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,520 
I am Officer Alex Murphy...

463
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,240 
...Detroit Police Department.

464
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,920 
That won't do.

465
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,720 
What are you?

466
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,080 
Robocop. Crime Prevention Unit.

467
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,880 
OCP.

468
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,720 
Better. Much better.

469
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,920 
I type it. You think it.

470
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,480 
You type it. I think it.

471
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,920 
What a wonderful opportunity
you represent.

472
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,880 
Psychotherapy, it's such a...

473
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,200 
It's a slow, clumsy practice.
But with you this is so simple.

474
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,120 
Direct.

475
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,680 
You're lucky.

476
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:17,720 
We can do in moments with you what
would take years with a human patient.

477
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,200 
I'm really very lucky.

478
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,600 
You're free. You're free from doubt.
Free from having to make painful choices.

479
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,480 
I am free.

480
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,160 
He's ready.

481
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,360 
Uploading command program.

482
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,080 
I am so glad we had this chance
to dialogue.

483
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,080 
Look at you. It's like you're brand-new.

484
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,680 
Thank you. Thank you.

485
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,880 
You really had us worried there, Murphy.

486
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,440 
I'm touched.

487
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,320 
Get this guy.

488
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,560 
He's touched.

489
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,560 
That's enough. All of you,
back to your posts. Come on. Let's go.

490
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,800 
How you feeling, Murphy?

491
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,480 
I'm just fine, Warren.
Thank you for asking.

492
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,880 
Let's get you downstairs.

493
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:25,440 
I want to see what those amateurs
at OCP screwed up.

494
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:29,000 
Pity. It's a beautiful morning.

495
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,320 
Shame to waste it.

496
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,480 
- Ready for duty, partner?
- You betcha.

497
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,160 
- Let's go.
- Nothing I'd rather do.

498
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,920 
He sounds terrific.

499
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,640 
Something's wrong.

500
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,240 
Harder!

501
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,880 
It's Robo!
Everybody out the back door!

502
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,520 
- It's locked!
- It won't open!

503
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,160 
Murph, wake up, will you?

504
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,040 
Good morning.

505
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,120 
Come on, take him out.

506
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,400 
I think we should talk.

507
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,360 
What's with you, Murph?

508
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,080 
- Where'd they go?
- "Where'd they go?"

509
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:23,520 
They're still here,
the little bastards!

510
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,840 
Hands up! Let's go! Everybody up!

511
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,920 
Move it. Up against the wall.

512
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,080 
Let's go.

513
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,280 
Hands on top of your heads.
Nobody move.

514
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,040 
You are under arrest.

515
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,600 
You have the right to remain silent.

516
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,280 
Anything you say can and will
be used against you...

517
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,240 
...in a court of law.
- He's dead, Murphy.

518
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,480 
- You have the right...
- You're reading Miranda to a corpse!

519
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,440 
I'm having trouble.

520
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,840 
Oh, my.

521
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,560 
This isn't very nice.

522
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:25,760 
Though you may think
you're having fun now...

523
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,280 
...you only hurt the one you love.

524
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,520 
Think of Mom and Dad.

525
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,080 
What kind of lesson are
you teaching them?

526
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,480 
And now, a word on nutrition.

527
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,680 
Shit! He's fucked up!

528
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,440 
Bad language makes for bad feelings.

529
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,960 
Let's go!

530
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,680 
The point is...

531
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,240 
...we all have to work.

532
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,760 
I haven't finished.

533
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,200 
Hit the gas, Murphy.

534
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,680 
The posted limit is 35.

535
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,280 
We should set an example, Anne.

536
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,920 
Your hair looks lovely that way.

537
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,880 
It's OCP. They did something to you.

538
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,560 
I'm fine.

539
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,360 
Isn't the moon wonderful tonight?

540
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,520 
It's still daytime.

541
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,040 
It's the thought that counts.

542
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:28,240 
Oh, Jesus, we're heading back
to the station. That's all there is to it.

543
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,520 
What the hell are you doing?!

544
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,800 
Waste makes haste...

545
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,960 
...for time is fleeting.

546
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,080 
A rolling stone is won'th
two in the bush.

547
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,480 
Go fuck a refrigerator, pecker neck!

548
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,200 
Bad language makes for bad feelings.

549
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,880 
You're nuts!

550
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,600 
Murphy, come on, let's go.

551
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,960 
Come on!

552
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,440 
Back!

553
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,840 
Thank you for not smoking.

554
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,200 
Well, there it is. It's OCP.

555
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,400 
They screwed him up.

556
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,080 
He must be going out of his mind.

557
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,720 
It's not as if he can just say no.

558
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,920 
They put all this nonsense
into his brain. He has to obey.

559
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,000 
Take them out, all of them!

560
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,720 
Can't be done,
not with this equipment.

561
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:07,040 
Are you saying there's no way?
I can't believe that.

562
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,400 
Sure, there are ways.
You can pull his cranial circuits.

563
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,880 
Which would shut down
his life-support.

564
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:16,320 
You could run a few thousand volts
through him.

565
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,560 
Probably kill him.

566
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,240 
I'll get some help!

567
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,960 
- Get him inside!
- Come on, move it!

568
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,240 
- Come on!
- Don't touch him, he's hot!

569
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,000 
Use your jackets.

570
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,400 
Why'd he do that?

571
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,360 
Fried himself to get rid
of OCP's crazy commands.

572
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:37,440 
- Nice and easy.
- He weighs a ton.

573
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,200 
Out of the way! Move out!

574
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,040 
- Think he's alive?
- I don't know. He's pretty hot.

575
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,520 
Put me down.

576
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,680 
All right. Come on, stand him up.

577
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,800 
Are we cops?

578
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,720 
What's bugging you, Murph?

579
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,520 
Cain.

580
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,840 
Cain's bugging me.

581
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,480 
We have only just begun, my flock.

582
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,440 
Soon we will expand from city to city.

583
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:34,040 
The rich and poor alike
will know a paradise...

584
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,240 
...for every moment of their lives.

585
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,600 
This is a Nuke for every mood.

586
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,400 
We'll offer the opportunity...

587
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:46,240 
...to control every aspect
of their emotional lives.

588
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,920 
Here with the white noise
and black thunder...

589
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:52,560 
...and the red ramrod
and the blue velvet.

590
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,480 
Frank. The blue velvet.

591
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,520 
I think it's ready, sir.

592
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,360 
Thank you, Frank.

593
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:20,600 
Frank. The Benzedrine's
got my teeth wiggling.

594
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,840 
Cut it with scopolamine.

595
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,680 
- Five mils per.
- Yes, sir.

596
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,280 
Made in America.

597
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,280 
Yeah. We're gonna make that
mean something again.

598
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,080 
- Hey! Cops!
- What?

599
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,600 
Cops!

600
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,520 
And they ain't carrying
no picket signs!

601
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:48,200 
They're going to kick somebody's ass!

602
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:10,000 
Give me your hand, goddamn it!

603
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,040 
Christ!

604
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,560 
Fuck.

605
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,680 
Fuck!

606
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,000 
Get out!

607
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,120 
Bomb! Get down!

608
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,560 
You son of a bitch!

609
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,880 
Five hundred million in cash.
Nuke money seized by police.

610
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:32,040 
But State Attorney Sphincter won't let
the bankrupt city government touch it.

611
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,440 
Coming up next, threats from the police
union and cheers from the public...

612
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:41,080 
...as Metro-North cops go back to work
and apprehend the Nuke lord, Cain...

613
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,560 
...who may not live to stand trial.

614
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:51,280 
They say 20 seconds
in the California sunshine...

615
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:54,400 
...is too much these days...

616
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,160 
...ever since we lost the ozone layer.

617
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:02,360 
But that was before Sunblock 5000.

618
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,800 
Just apply a pint...

619
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,720 
...to your body...

620
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:11,080 
...and you're good for hours.

621
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,840 
See you by the pool.

622
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,360 
{y:i}Sunblock 5000.

623
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:28,000 
{y:i}Protection for the new age.

624
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,680 
Subject is violently antisocial...

625
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:34,400 
...given to delusions of godhood.

626
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:38,280 
And he's hopelessly addicted
to narcotics.

627
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,960 
Which offers us a simple
and infallible method...

628
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:45,520 
...of insuring his obedience.

629
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,160 
You're perfect.

630
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,200 
I must have you.

631
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:04,320 
What are you talking about?
It's like you don't even care!

632
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:07,440 
- Just do what I say, Angie!
- He'd want us to come for him!

633
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:11,200 
Forget about it! It's not gonna happen!
I'm through arguing with you!

634
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:15,760 
I'm not asking permission! Cain is
in the hospital, and we're getting him.

635
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:19,520 
You've really thought this out, haven't you?
What about the cops?

636
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,200 
We've got guns!

637
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:24,080 
- Damn it, Hob, Cain needs us!
- Fuck Cain!

638
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:29,120 
- He'd kill you if he heard you.
- He's not gonna kill anybody!

639
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:32,440 
- Shit, he's probably dead already.
- You just shut the hell up!

640
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:36,400 
You mouth off like that again,
and it's no more Nuke for you, bitch.

641
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,200 
Damn it, Hob, you know that's not fair.

642
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:42,880 
Now, come on.

643
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:46,640 
- It's been a bad time.
- Sure has. You're really hurting.

644
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:48,560 
Yeah, so I'm hurting.

645
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,360 
You're gonna get the shakes soon, Angie.

646
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,320 
You got it bad.

647
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,000 
You little bastard.

648
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:03,560 
You just do what I tell you
from now on, Angie.

649
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,560 
Start the motor and drive.

650
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,080 
He'll kill you.

651
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,040 
He'll kill us both.

652
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,720 
Fuck him.

653
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,040 
Oh, you're a mess.

654
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,680 
I got good news for you.

655
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:42,120 
You're going to have a chance
for immortality.

656
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,360 
As long as nothing happens
to that lovely brain.

657
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:58,440 
Dr. Weltman? It's Faxx.

658
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,520 
I'm afraid we lost our patient.

659
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:03,280 
Yeah, he just expired.

660
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:08,080 
Contact the organ harvest team. We've got
six minutes before the brain's useless.

661
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,520 
Night.

662
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:37,000 
Come on. Let's move it.
We've only got five minutes.

663
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,680 
Lock it up.

664
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,320 
Move the screen in closer.
I can't read it.

665
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:54,040 
- How'd we get this one?
- Well, Faxx found him.

666
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,920 
He volunteered.

667
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,840 
Volunteered?

668
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,680 
Big-hearted guy.

669
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,440 
Yeah, it's not the heart
we're after, though.

670
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:09,160 
Speaking of hearts, how's llene?

671
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,560 
Christ, does everybody know?

672
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,040 
All right, hold your breath.

673
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,920 
Showtime.

674
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,720 
It's nice and clean in here.
There's no damage.

675
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,360 
Here we go.

676
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,880 
Easy.

677
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:57,480 
We got it. Here it comes.

678
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,240 
- Thing of beauty.
- Excellent.

679
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:03,560 
I don't know about the rest of you,
but I'm hungry.

680
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,520 
Thank you!

681
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:23,960 
Yes!

682
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,720 
Spider Baby Stalirski!

683
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,440 
He's come out for Detroit,
and now you come out for him.

684
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:32,800 
The lines are open,
waiting for your pledge.

685
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,960 
If you want an honest government...

686
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,720 
{y:i}... that works for you...

687
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:42,200 
{y:i}... I'm asking you to dig deep
{y:i}into your pockets.

688
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:45,360 
{y:i}I'm asking you to give...

689
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:48,400 
{y:i}... whatever you can spare!

690
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,240 
Where does that put us?

691
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,120 
Hi. Yes, ma'am.

692
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:59,200 
Hello! This is Mayor Kuzak!

693
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:02,440 
{y:i}Could you turn down your set, please?

694
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,000 
Your Honor...

695
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:11,400 
...I have some very good news for you.

696
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,640 
I think...

697
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:16,160 
...the city is saved.

698
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,080 
Now...

699
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:22,040 
...you listen very carefully.

700
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,920 
It's no bluff.
Someone's shown up to bail the city out.

701
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:29,000 
- A rival corporation.
- The mayor isn't saying.

702
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:32,840 
And whoever it is is taking great
pains to keep their identity secret.

703
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:36,840 
They're paying in cash and they're not
moving the money through the banks.

704
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,400 
Thank you, councilman.

705
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,800 
That will be all.

706
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:45,560 
You know, once you guys take over...

707
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,720 
Your services to OCP
will be rewarded.

708
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:56,800 
If the city can pay,
we'll be humiliated.

709
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,520 
It's worse than that. We've shifted
80 percent of our resources...

710
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:02,880 
...to the urban pacification plan.

711
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:07,960 
If we can't foreclose, public confidence
in OCP will plummet, so will our stock.

712
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:09,480 
Sir?

713
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:11,240 
If I may?

714
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,240 
There's another option.

715
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:18,280 
We certainly have the surveillance
capabilities to follow the mayor.

716
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,840 
It all depends how far
we're willing to go.

717
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:25,840 
If anything went wrong...

718
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:27,960 
As I said, sir...

719
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,440 
...it all depends how far
we're willing to go.

720
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:34,240 
We have no legal recourse.

721
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,040 
There must be no witnesses.

722
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:48,640 
You've gone too far! Give me...

723
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,440 
Your blood pressure.

724
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:54,280 
Get me fired if you want to.
You're not bringing illegal drugs to my lab!

725
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:58,640 
I'll do worse than get you fired.
Now leave me alone!

726
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,960 
Such terrible pain.

727
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,800 
You don't remember me.

728
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:20,280 
But you do remember this, don't you?

729
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,600 
And we have it.
All the Nuke you'll ever need.

730
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,360 
Not so fast.

731
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,480 
I need you to do something
for me first.

732
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,440 
Then the pain stops.

733
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,560 
Good boy.

734
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:10,800 
I don't like this. I think we'd better
get out of here while we can.

735
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,800 
I know what I'm doing.

736
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,080 
If you have any cash,
put it in your shorts.

737
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:48,360 
That's just plain rude.

738
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,280 
I wonder if any of you could help me.

739
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,480 
I'm looking for a Mr. Hob.

740
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:06,960 
So...

741
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,120 
...how much you need?

742
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,600 
Money, I mean.

743
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:14,920 
Well, our current debt to OCP is...

744
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:20,040 
$37,480,911 dollars.

745
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,760 
Guess you're in some pretty deep shit.

746
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,080 
We need all the help we can get,
young man.

747
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,880 
Tell you what. Put me down for 50,
just to make sure.

748
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:32,040 
- 50 cents, 50 dollars. That's cute.
- Don't be a queer.

749
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:34,440 
Fifty million.

750
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,120 
This is bullshit.
Let's get out of here.

751
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,320 
Good God.

752
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,480 
Gentlemen?

753
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,560 
Well, will 50 do it?

754
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:20,080 
Oh, yes. That'll do it.

755
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:22,720 
- Don't you guys think that'll do it?
- Yeah.

756
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:25,840 
Fifty mil. That will do it.

757
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,840 
- That'll do it.
- These people are criminals!

758
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,400 
Why do you have to label people?

759
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,840 
- I hate labels!
- You shut up.

760
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,480 
We cannot capitulate
in the war on crime.

761
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:06,120 
I'd be voted out of office.
I don't think anyone wants that.

762
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,280 
War on crime is fine with us.

763
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:11,160 
It's business we're talking about here.

764
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:13,720 
Do you have any idea
how many people we employ?

765
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:17,280 
No. I never thought
about it like that.

766
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:18,600 
Sharp kid.

767
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,160 
So...

768
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:22,400 
...your war on crime...

769
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,280 
...you want to win it or what?

770
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:27,680 
We're the only chance you have.

771
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,680 
Listen to him.

772
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,600 
He's got it all worked out.

773
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:39,760 
Why do people do crimes?

774
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:44,920 
- Why? Drugs. People do drugs.
- Because they want drugs.

775
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,440 
The kind that cost too much.

776
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:51,000 
Nuke gives high quality
at a cheap price.

777
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,520 
If you get off our backs,
we'll make it cheaper.

778
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:54,680 
And safer.

779
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,240 
We don't shove our shit
down anybody's throat.

780
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:01,000 
And we don't advertise it
like they do with cigarettes or booze.

781
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:03,040 
So leave us alone...

782
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:06,040 
...and anybody who wants it gets it.

783
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:10,240 
So no more crimes.

784
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:14,160 
You get to be the mayor
who cleaned up Detroit.

785
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:23,440 
He's got a point.

786
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:26,320 
Don't you think he's got a point?

787
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,480 
Yeah, he's got a point.

788
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,440 
What the hell is that?

789
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,720 
Get out!

790
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,800 
Marv, are...?

791
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:35,360 
Cain.

792
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:37,400 
Oh, wow.

793
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:43,040 
You look great.

794
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:44,480 
It'll take some getting used to...

795
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,440 
...but it'll be great, Cain.

796
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:52,480 
Lie still.

797
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:01,600 
- I'm cold.
- You are going into shock.

798
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:04,680 
I will call for a medical emergency unit.

799
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,280 
Wait. No.

800
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,880 
Don't leave me.

801
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:15,680 
I won't leave you.

802
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:22,600 
Who did this?

803
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,560 
It was big.

804
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,520 
Bigger than you.

805
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:29,760 
It was Cain.

806
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,560 
I'm gonna die.

807
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:38,520 
You know what that's like, don't you?

808
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:42,200 
It really sucks.

809
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,040 
Yes.

810
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:14,920 
{y:i}Thirteen dead in what appears
{y:i}to be a Nuke money massacre.

811
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:18,240 
{y:i}Among the victims,
{y:i}two city councilmen.

812
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:21,560 
{y:i}Was the city trying to strike a deal
{y:i}with the drug lords?

813
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:24,880 
No comment!
I said, I have no comment!

814
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:27,000 
No comments on these allegations.

815
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:30,200 
These were men
who served this city tirelessly.

816
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:34,600 
However, I make a promise
to the people of Detroit City...

817
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:38,000 
...that no effort will be spared
to investigate this thoroughly!

818
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,000 
But, Mr. Mayor, what about...?

819
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:42,720 
I'm sorry. No more questions.

820
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:44,920 
{y:i}Our own Mayor Kuzak.

821
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,800 
{y:i}Now let's go live to Jess.

822
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:52,040 
And here it is, the Civic Centrum, OCP's
100-story gift to the Motor City.

823
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:55,280 
While debate continues
over OCP's hostile takeover...

824
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:58,040 
...there's no denying
the mood down here is festive.

825
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:01,680 
Citizens interviewed on the scene
expressed excitement and hope...

826
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:06,080 
...that OCP will make good on its
promise of a better life in Detroit.

827
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:08,280 
- Press!
- Sorry, folks, media only.

828
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,640 
TV and press only.
You'll have to step back.

829
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:20,680 
There he is!

830
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:29,320 
Can OCP bring industry
back to Detroit?

831
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:32,040 
Does OCP own the city?
Will you hold elections?

832
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:35,520 
- Do we become OCP employees?
- Why not go to City Hall?

833
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:37,240 
Just a minute.

834
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,640 
I'll answer that, young lady.

835
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:44,440 
City Hall is the decaying symbol
of mismanagement and corruption.

836
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:45,800 
You get that?

837
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:49,960 
This magnificent structure will be the seat
of leadership for the new Detroit.

838
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:53,360 
And what better place
for a clean, fresh start?

839
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:56,640 
And so, people of the press...

840
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,480 
...city officials...

841
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:01,920 
...in a few minutes
Omni Consumer Products...

842
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:04,880 
...and the troubled city of Detroit...

843
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:08,880 
...will join in a bold new venture.

844
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:11,080 
Now I'd like to explain...

845
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:13,160 
...just what this will mean.

846
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:16,000 
Sometimes we just
have to start over...

847
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:17,560 
...from scratch...

848
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:19,600 
...to make things right.

849
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:23,440 
And that's exactly
what we're going to do.

850
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:26,240 
We're going to build
a brand-new city...

851
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,680 
...where Detroit now stands.

852
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:30,840 
An example...

853
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:32,640 
...to the world.

854
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:54,840 
My friends...

855
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,240 
...welcome to our city
as it should be.

856
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:02,320 
And as it will be,
in the hands of responsible...

857
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:04,720 
...private enterprise.

858
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:07,920 
And a special welcome...

859
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:11,440 
...to Mayor Kuzak
and the outgoing administration.

860
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,520 
We're not going anywhere.

861
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:15,520 
Your Honor.

862
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:21,000 
You'll have to tear down a lot
of houses to make that.

863
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:22,920 
I mean, take away their homes!

864
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:26,160 
We're going to raise towers
of glass and steel.

865
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:30,120 
Every citizen will have a living unit,
safe, secure, and clean.

866
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:31,800 
Now, please take your seat.

867
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,120 
Won't be much room for neighborhoods.

868
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:36,520 
Not like the kind we all grew up in.

869
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:39,720 
Today neighborhoods are places
where bad things happen.

870
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:41,120 
Don't be nostalgic.

871
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:44,400 
What about democracy?
Nobody elected you.

872
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:47,000 
Anyone can buy OCP stock...

873
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:49,720 
...and own a piece of our city.

874
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:52,960 
What could be more democratic
than that?

875
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:57,600 
There's a lot of people in this town
that can't afford to buy your stock!

876
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,960 
And they won't let you
get away with this.

877
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:02,320 
You haven't been following the polls.

878
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:05,680 
Sit down.

879
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:09,840 
Sit down, mayor.

880
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,920 
About a year ago
we gave this city Robocop.

881
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:18,440 
I think he's worked out pretty well.

882
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:20,920 
But things have become
rougher out there.

883
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:24,080 
And now we need
a law enforcement unit...

884
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:26,520 
...able to meet the enemy
on his own ground...

885
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:29,520 
...and carrying enough firepower...

886
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:32,160 
...to get the job done.

887
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,960 
Ladies and gentlemen...

888
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:40,880 
...with great pleasure...

889
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:42,720 
...I give you...

890
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:45,080 
...Robocop 2.

891
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:57,040 
- Those bastards are maniacs!
- What's the matter?

892
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:00,160 
I can't believe it.
It was them! They sent it!

893
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:01,800 
Sent what?

894
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:03,560 
Nothing.

895
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:06,160 
There going to be a big call
for this unit.

896
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:08,520 
And we'll make him right here in Detroit.

897
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:11,640 
That means jobs
we can all be proud of.

898
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:14,000 
And make "Made in America"...

899
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:16,520 
...mean something again.

900
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:21,560 
This single container...

901
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,920 
...holds enough Nuke
to addict a city block.

902
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:28,200 
A hundred of these
are produced every day...

903
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:29,800 
...and sent to sweatshops...

904
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,920 
...where urban slaves
prepare this poison...

905
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:36,160 
...for our friends, our loved ones,
our children.

906
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:37,880 
Now, I say...

907
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:41,400 
...it's high time
we put an end to this plague.

908
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:45,680 
Robocop 2 will seek out
every laboratory...

909
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:49,080 
...every dealer,
and rid our city of Nuke.

910
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:54,600 
Yes.

911
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:58,000 
Things will be a lot quieter
with this boy around.

912
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:16,000 
- What's wrong with him?
- It's nothing.

913
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:18,720 
- Nothing at all.
- Turn him off.

914
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:21,040 
I can't.

915
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:23,520 
Cain! Let's step outside.

916
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:29,280 
You! Get out of here!
You're obsolete!

917
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:31,080 
That thing is a killer!

918
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:34,680 
- It's not even armed! It's harmless!
- It's a killer, and I saw it!

919
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:53,280 
- Take her out of here! Now!
- Let me go!

920
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,880 
Behave yourselves!

921
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:08,520 
- What's the deal here?
- Christ knows. Sounds like a war in there.

922
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:25,120 
You're coming with me, Cain.

923
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:25,400 
There he is!

924
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:40,640 
- All right, get back!
- Are you jealous of the replacement?

925
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:34,000 
This could look bad for OCP, Johnson.

926
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:37,440 
Scramble the best spin team we have.

927
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:49,600 
Ammo! Ammo!

928
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:11,240 
Get down!

929
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:34,200 
Hold your fire!

930
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:37,400 
Hold your fire, damn it!

931
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:01,040 
Let's get him out of here.

932
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:06,680 
Watch his neck. He's hurt bad. Easy.

933
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:14,280 
Shit!

934
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,000 
I gotta get back.

935
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:19,240 
Move it back! Move it back!

936
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:36,840 
Let's give him what he wants.

937
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:38,880 
Goodbye.

938
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:13,440 
It's serious trouble.
So many dead and wounded.

939
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:15,640 
There won't be trouble from the dead.

940
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,960 
They'll have relatives. They always do.

941
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:21,200 
- It'll be a feeding frenzy.
- It's only money.

942
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:23,400 
- What about criminal proceedings?
- Well...

943
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:27,440 
...we're looking at major indictments, sir.
Prison terms.

944
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:30,240 
- What about me?
- You know we'll do whatever we can.

945
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:32,280 
- That's not good enough.
- Sir?

946
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:34,760 
What if this was the work
of one individual?

947
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:38,880 
A person who had her own agenda, wasn't
in sync with the goals of our company?

948
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:41,800 
Well, that usually works.

949
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:44,720 
A woman who was not a team player.

950
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:47,520 
Who violated our trust.

951
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:50,960 
Easy, easy.

952
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:52,960 
Well...

953
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:55,600 
...we'd need some evidence
to support that.

954
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:58,520 
Sir, whether it exists or not,
I know I can find it.

955
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:01,720 
She did choose the brain, sir.

956
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:05,480 
- Good thinking.
- Sir.

957
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:07,800 
Thank God you're all right.

958
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:11,320 
I was worried. I thought
it was going to hurt you.

959
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:13,560 
It's over. It's all over.

960
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:16,440 
I failed you.

961
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:20,480 
Don't be hard on yourself.
Everything's going to be all right.

962
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:27,240 
Johnson, that business
we were talking about.

963
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:29,360 
Get right on it.

964
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:35,000 
Yes, sir.

965
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:42,640 
Just look at what they've done.
They are criminals.

966
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:45,560 
OCP won't own this city for long.
And I'll see to that.

967
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:48,160 
I'll take it to the streets
and the people.

968
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:49,720 
What has it come to?

969
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:52,560 
Businessmen can buy our rights
like stock?

970
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,880 
You don't realize what we're losing!

971
01:49:56,760 --> 01:49:58,920 
- Right here, sir!
- Give us a statement!

972
01:49:59,120 --> 01:50:02,840 
Dozens are dead.
Is this your idea of a better life?

973
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:06,880 
- Was this an experiment of some kind?
- He was crazy. How did it happen?

974
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:10,960 
- Did you build it to take control?
- How do you account for this disaster?

975
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:14,360 
Will OCP make reparations
to the victims?

976
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:17,560 
That son of a bitch
is getting away with it.

977
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:19,640 
We can't even touch him.

978
01:50:21,160 --> 01:50:22,880 
Patience, Lewis.

979
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:26,360 
We're only human.
