on Dan's phone.

896
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,731
But Rodney might
still be out there.

897
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:24,279
I know that this is very hard

898
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:26,847
for you, but...

899
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,479
I do have a procedure
that I have to follow.

900
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,559
It sounds like there's
no procedure at all.

901
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,719
- Bud!
- No, no, no, no, no.

doing a goddamn thing.

903
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:41,649
Now, either you're all
afraid to go in there...

904
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,959
or, uh...

905
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:48,839
you just don't give a shit.
- You walking down the wrong road.

906
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:51,599
I said I'm into it,
and I said I'll handle it.

907

908

- You need to stay out of my business.
- Stay out of your business.

909
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,999
- Knock it off.
- Stay out of your business.

910

While I was away, it seems that

911
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,959
all that you was into
was my business.

912
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:04,519

I'm gonna be on it until it's done.

An address? How am I
gonna get that address?

932

as well as I do that John Petty has one.

can dig that up.

No, no, no, don't see
if you can dig it up.

- Do it.
- Russell, listen to me.

you let these boys handle it.

is a nasty son of a bitch.

money to these people.

944
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,479
A hell of a lot of money.
I know they had this whole deal,

945
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:21,439
but I didn't realize
it was this big.

946
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:24,439
- What deal?
- Well, this bare-knuckle deal

947

I don't know that much about it,
but my guess is,

949
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,479
Rodney went up there to fight.

950
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:33,319
Well, why didn't you just
say something to Wesley?

951

Well, I don't... I don't know.

I mean, I didn't...
I didn't know what to say.

953

John should've known better.

954
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,679
I think he did, Red,
but Rodney forced his hand.

955
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,928
He thought it was the only way
to pay off that debt.

956
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:50,719
I don't see DeGroat's address, but
I do know it's up in the Ramapos.

And, Russell, please
hear me when I tell you,

you'd be way better off letting
the authorities deal with him.

such a good job, Dan.

but John hated dealing with them.

down here to get their money.
