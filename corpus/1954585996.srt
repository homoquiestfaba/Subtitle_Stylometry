1
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,670
It was my greatest victory

2
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:16,532
the dream of every commander

3
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:20,843
I have deluded myself into thinking
I could reunite all the kingdoms

4
00:01:20,844 --> 00:01:22,756
under a single flag

5
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:29,672
but further battles would be
needed

6
00:01:31,756 --> 00:01:36,003
there was more blood to shed

7
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:47,810
for the first time I felt lost

8
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:56,144
it was too late to turn back and too early
to declare that foolis war over forever

9
00:01:57,786 --> 00:02:04,980
my crown could no longer have stood
the weight of more lost lives

10
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:11,826
so it was that in the depths of
desperation I raised my eyes to heaven

11
00:02:11,827 --> 00:02:15,865
praying that someone infinitely
greater than me could help me

12
00:02:22,115 --> 00:02:30,448
the gods stayed silent but that very day
someone else decided to listen to my pleas

13
00:02:59,824 --> 00:03:01,943
what evil thing is this?

14
00:03:01,944 --> 00:03:05,210
Who are you?!

15
00:03:05,211 --> 00:03:09,867
When someone answers your
prayers call it evil

16
00:03:09,868 --> 00:03:17,166
I'm here to give you more power to trample over
all the principles on which your voice rests.

17
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:22,379
How valuable this tendency is
for us king Wolfkhan.

18
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,463
What do you want from me?

19
00:03:24,464 --> 00:03:26,549
Why are we here?

20
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,800
How do you know my name?

21
00:03:27,801 --> 00:03:29,851
It's very simple

22
00:03:29,852 --> 00:03:37,323
I want to thank you and propose a pact that
will put an end to your foolish remorse

23
00:03:37,324 --> 00:03:39,930
thank me? What for?

24
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:43,056
For the blood you have spilt
over all these years

25
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:47,227
the blood of brave warriors but
also blood of the innocent.

26
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:50,844
Guilty of only being on the
wrong side of the conflict.

27
00:03:50,845 --> 00:03:54,527
You have been an unwitting
messenger of death

28
00:03:54,528 --> 00:03:58,141
who has made us again as
powerful as we once were.

29
00:03:58,142 --> 00:04:03,911
Do you want to end the war early and reign
as the sole one over the whole continent

30
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:08,568
we are ready to give you what
you want. But on one condition

31
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:14,201
each of you heirs must be
sacrificed to our dark lord.

32
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:21,913
How can you even think I could
accept so foul of an offer?

33
00:04:21,914 --> 00:04:24,524
Don't lie to yourself.

34
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:30,917
You already have.

35
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,385
Ahhhh!

36
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,257
Ahahahahahaha!

37
00:05:21,797 --> 00:05:23,882
"Over the years,.

38
00:05:23,883 --> 00:05:27,495
The memory of that day faded.

39
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:33,265
Almost into nothing, years of
great victories followed.

40
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:37,857
The destructive fury of our
swords was truly awesome.

41
00:05:42,023 --> 00:05:48,279
Nothing seemed capable of
stopping us.

42
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,936
One warm spring the birth of
luna, my daughter

43
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:58,670
the overwhelming joy that invaded
my heart however was chilled,

44
00:05:58,671 --> 00:06:02,319
by a terrible discovery.

45
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,568
On luna's chest, there was a
mark, like a scar.

46
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:11,252
The demon, had kept it's promise

47
00:06:11,253 --> 00:06:14,210
and now I had to keep mine.

48
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:07,778
Please, can you help me? I'm trying to find the king.
I have an important message for him.

49
00:09:03,045 --> 00:09:06,206
Sword!, where's my sword?

50
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:13,233
The gladiators already warming up in
the arena and the king has no sword!?

51
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,082
Out, everyone, out of here.

52
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:25,156
Marion, where are you, you
witch.

53
00:09:31,406 --> 00:09:36,027
Your majesty you really must see
her.

54
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:38,669
She looks exactly like your dead
queen.

55
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,838
I couldn't believe my very eyes.

56
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:47,009
Could it be lorna your lost
daughter?

57
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:52,882
Look, I have kept her in a cell
apart so no one else may see her

58
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:56,673
you must see her your majesty.

59
00:11:03,087 --> 00:11:08,650
I knew you peasants from the lands to the
east could handle a hoe but not a sword.

60
00:11:10,387 --> 00:11:14,070
If you insist I'll show you where we
yocals from the east stick our hoes.

61
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:15,772
Leave him alone kayne

62
00:11:15,773 --> 00:11:19,178
you'll have a chance to show this
puppet a lesson at the tournament

63
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,437
better listen to your little
girlfriend yocal

64
00:11:21,438 --> 00:11:24,184
besides, it would be more fun
watching you eat the mud

65
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:27,312
in front of an arena full of
people.

66
00:11:27,313 --> 00:11:29,362
So, on his deathbed,

67
00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:34,541
the man who I believed to be my father
for all those years, told me a story.

68
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:37,182
He said when I was a little
baby,

69
00:11:37,183 --> 00:11:40,727
he saved me from drowning in the
kooney river.

70
00:11:40,728 --> 00:11:46,258
He said Miles before he saw some type of
mysterious hooded figure throw me in.

71
00:11:49,382 --> 00:11:53,936
This is the only thing I have
from my past.

72
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,322
This little stone.

73
00:12:07,697 --> 00:12:12,388
Since then I have traveled around
the world looking for this stone.

74
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:13,953
I knew if I found it

75
00:12:13,954 --> 00:12:17,600
I'd also find my real parents.

76
00:12:17,601 --> 00:12:19,583
I just wanted to ask them

77
00:12:19,584 --> 00:12:22,538
why they did this to me.

78
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:28,272
May I burn in hell if ever we
were guilty of such infamy.

79
00:12:28,273 --> 00:12:34,526
The truth is, someone kidnapped you
a few days after you were born.

80
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:38,106
Everything we did to find you
came to nothing.

81
00:12:38,107 --> 00:12:41,235
I thought I had lost you
forever.

82
00:12:41,236 --> 00:12:45,656
But fate has decided that we
meet again

83
00:12:52,947 --> 00:12:55,352
welcome home luna.

84
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,606
Keymock will now shine even more
brightly than ever before

85
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:09,490
what you need now is rest.

86
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:13,314
Your arrival comes the day before a
great tournament that I've announced

87
00:13:13,315 --> 00:13:18,492
to celebrate 10 years of peace
in our kingdom.

88
00:13:18,493 --> 00:13:23,496
It's the perfect way of blessing
the festivities.

89
00:13:23,497 --> 00:13:29,371
Tomorrow, we shall speak for
now, rest.

90
00:13:29,372 --> 00:13:36,296
Guard, take her to the royal apartments. Make
sure that no one enters without my consents.

91
00:13:43,587 --> 00:13:49,736
I advise your majesty to treat this
situation with the utmost caution.

92
00:13:49,737 --> 00:13:51,334
What do you mean?

93
00:13:51,335 --> 00:13:58,009
I don't know but, for now I
prefer to remain silent.

94
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:04,055
But there is something about this
situation that I do not like.

95
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:06,459
Good!, good!

96
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:17,436
Keep quiet, now don't put a dampener
on things for no good reason.

97
00:14:17,437 --> 00:14:22,579
Now more than ever, is a time
for our kingdom to celebrate.

98
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,359
As you wish, your majesty.

99
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,373
It's amazing how closely you
resemble each other.

100
00:15:02,374 --> 00:15:09,116
The same light in your eyes the
same rays of sunshine in your hair.

101
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:14,363
Looking at you makes having her
back with me, my daughter.

102
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:17,457
You both look so happy in this
picture.

103
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,099
Yes we were.

104
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,713
Your birth brought great joy to
our hearts.

105
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:27,849
You should have seen us, we were
like newly weds.

106
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,908
She would have only be born just
a few days.

107
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:36,195
Yet already she had begun to plan
every moment of your future.

108
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,824
How, how did my mother die?

109
00:15:43,907 --> 00:15:48,980
Part of her died the day when
you were kidnapped.

110
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,969
And then there was that night,

111
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:56,558
but you have plenty of time to learn the
history of your family my daughter.

112
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,553
Today is the Eve of a very
festival here in keymock.

113
00:16:00,554 --> 00:16:05,280
And your return would make it an
even more memorable event.

114
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:08,895
I want everything to be perfect.

115
00:16:08,896 --> 00:16:12,022
In the meantime, I have a
surprise for you.

116
00:16:12,023 --> 00:16:13,621
A surprise?

117
00:16:13,622 --> 00:16:17,235
Yes, I had our best tailors make
a special costume

118
00:16:17,236 --> 00:16:24,106
so that everyone can see the beauty
of king Wolfkhan's daughter!

119
00:18:23,015 --> 00:18:26,317
People of keymock!

120
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:36,188
For centuries history has taught
us that no army is invincible

121
00:18:38,271 --> 00:18:42,376
with the coming of our kingdom history
has been forced to re-write it's pages

122
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:53,834
the crowns of the most powerful rulers, have
had to bow down before our implacable force

123
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:08,882
thanks to our great warriors, keymock now
stands unopposed for splendor and glory.

124
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:16,851
By any other kingdom.

125
00:19:17,893 --> 00:19:26,226
That is why, it is our duty now
to celebrate their courage

126
00:19:30,264 --> 00:19:35,059
but there is another reason to
be happy,

127
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:43,393
truth, that the past gives back more
thank just thoughts of war and blood.

128
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:56,156
The past can even give us hope
of a better future.

129
00:19:56,157 --> 00:20:03,002
This, is luna! My daughter,
found again!

130
00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:12,979
And now, let the tournament
begin!

131
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:06,401
Your majesty

132
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:17,689
marigon, bringer of doom, you're
missing a great show

133
00:21:17,691 --> 00:21:19,672
I asked to talk to you majesty

134
00:21:19,673 --> 00:21:23,321
on a matter of the utmost
urgency.

135
00:21:23,322 --> 00:21:26,450
Go on speak, what have you got
to say that's so important.

136
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:30,064
I prefer to talk to your
highness in private.

137
00:21:30,065 --> 00:21:35,834
Make your words carefully remember you are
in presence of the princess of keymock

138
00:21:35,835 --> 00:21:39,968
from her there shall be no
secrets.

139
00:21:39,969 --> 00:21:42,958
I would not dream of offending
our princess.

140
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:45,911
So happily amongst us yet again

141
00:21:45,912 --> 00:21:49,496
it is simply a matter concerning
our lands

142
00:21:52,621 --> 00:21:56,514
it would only bore the princess
and distract her from the show.

143
00:21:57,556 --> 00:22:00,682
So be it, out of my way.

144
00:22:00,683 --> 00:22:04,275
These issues had better be
really important.

145
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:17,820
Ahhhhh!

146
00:22:20,945 --> 00:22:24,107
So say what it is you have to
say to me.

147
00:22:24,108 --> 00:22:26,713
She is not your daughter.

148
00:22:26,714 --> 00:22:29,285
What is this nonsense you are
spouting.

149
00:22:29,286 --> 00:22:31,929
Luna is not the person she says
she is.

150
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,456
How dare you!

151
00:22:33,457 --> 00:22:38,182
I'll tear our that serpent
tongue of yours.

152
00:22:38,183 --> 00:22:41,658
She does not bare the scar on
her body she was born with

153
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:42,603
you see.

154
00:22:47,811 --> 00:22:50,381
It can not be.

155
00:22:50,382 --> 00:22:52,989
What do these inscriptions mean?

156
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:56,012
They speak of an ancient
prophecy.

157
00:22:56,014 --> 00:22:59,696
That ruled before the kingdom of
keymock.

158
00:22:59,697 --> 00:23:04,431
But why does just looking at it
terrify you so much?

159
00:23:11,722 --> 00:23:14,848
Yes, I know that

160
00:23:14,849 --> 00:23:18,777
I tried to convince myself that
it would be the nightmare.

161
00:23:18,778 --> 00:23:20,862
I made a pact with it

162
00:23:20,863 --> 00:23:28,195
keymock will prevail all
kingdoms. And soon.

163
00:23:28,196 --> 00:23:36,015
And in exchange the demon asked
for the lives of your children.

164
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:39,943
So that's why luna was snatched
away all those years ago.

165
00:23:39,944 --> 00:23:44,633
Now I finally understand what
happened even after then.

166
00:23:44,634 --> 00:23:49,848
Yes, it was the price I had to
pay.

167
00:23:49,849 --> 00:23:53,416
But how did you?

168
00:25:36,266 --> 00:25:38,838
Tell me what the prophecy says.

169
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:41,479
The prophecy says that if human

170
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,993
sacrifices take place.

171
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:58,578
That the noble blood spilt will
awake farmwort

172
00:25:58,579 --> 00:26:04,966
a huge titan who will take his armies and
conquer the earth. Chaos will begin.

173
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:35,732
Only the children of the pact
can kill the monster.

174
00:26:35,733 --> 00:26:39,867
But it must happen before the
human sacrifice begins.

175
00:26:39,868 --> 00:26:43,970
It's time someone knew the
truth.

176
00:27:29,846 --> 00:27:32,318
Ahhhh!

177
00:28:08,249 --> 00:28:12,940
I always knew that sooner or
later it would come to this.

178
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:17,392
But I never thought it would
happen in this way.

179
00:28:53,848 --> 00:28:56,452
Ahhhh!

180
00:28:56,453 --> 00:29:00,068
When is this ritual to take
place.

181
00:29:00,069 --> 00:29:01,667
I do not know my king

182
00:29:01,668 --> 00:29:06,745
the book says nothing about when
this will happen.

183
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:48,255
It has already begun.

184
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:06,658
Har!

185
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:09,161
The winner is har!

186
00:30:09,162 --> 00:30:13,053
If luna had had to lose you must
act now

187
00:30:13,054 --> 00:30:17,224
but this time you must trust me.

188
00:30:17,225 --> 00:30:25,558
Beware witch, I have already made
to many mistakes in my life.

189
00:30:35,227 --> 00:30:38,771
The day is coming to a close.

190
00:30:38,772 --> 00:30:43,463
And with it the first part of
the keymock tournament.

191
00:30:43,464 --> 00:30:47,118
Let the evenings feasting begin.

192
00:30:51,285 --> 00:30:54,412
At least I fight for a good
reason.

193
00:30:54,413 --> 00:30:56,469
Tomorrow I show you how you use
this.

194
00:31:08,765 --> 00:31:10,849
I like you brother.

195
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:14,985
But tonight the tavern waits for
us.

196
00:31:14,986 --> 00:31:16,448
Aneheel

197
00:31:18,531 --> 00:31:19,991
what?

198
00:31:19,992 --> 00:31:22,111
Listen to an old story.

199
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,718
Two lovers lila and machnan

200
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:27,984
asked a priest in neeheel to
marry them in secret.

201
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:30,869
But neheel fell in love with
lila.

202
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:37,089
And corrupted machnan to convince lila
to kill herself to prove her love.

203
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:40,983
Lila kills herself but machnan
runs mad with pain.

204
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:44,006
And neeheel feeds on it
becoming a demon

205
00:31:44,007 --> 00:31:49,706
and so they call neeheel those demons
who live on the suffering of man.

206
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:53,117
And how do you fight them?

207
00:31:58,325 --> 00:32:03,539
Only a demon can fight another
demon.

208
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:09,794
Lila chose the way of hell to
come back to defeat neeheel.

209
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:16,137
But it's just another children's
story. Nothing else.

210
00:34:05,703 --> 00:34:09,014
Are you still thinking about
that story for children.

211
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,959
Things can change

212
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,043
the whole world changes

213
00:34:23,044 --> 00:34:30,696
and I'm beginning to fear that
every night could be our last.

214
00:34:34,862 --> 00:34:39,482
Things end only when we want
them to.

215
00:34:39,483 --> 00:34:42,508
The king

216
00:36:26,668 --> 00:36:30,247
what you looking for has never
been written

217
00:36:30,248 --> 00:36:33,308
you know that don't you.

218
00:36:35,391 --> 00:36:39,561
I never understood how you
thought you'd find the answers

219
00:36:39,562 --> 00:36:44,460
to all of your problems in
ancient history

220
00:36:44,462 --> 00:36:46,025
who are you?

221
00:36:46,026 --> 00:36:48,631
Who am I?

222
00:36:48,632 --> 00:36:51,863
It's a great question

223
00:36:51,864 --> 00:36:53,915
you should know

224
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:59,336
aren't you supposed to know
everything

225
00:36:59,337 --> 00:37:02,951
maybe.. Hmmm

226
00:37:02,952 --> 00:37:06,634
maybe the more important
question is

227
00:37:06,635 --> 00:37:09,976
what do I know about you

228
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:18,943
maybe I know that your prepared to
tell the king everything about me.

229
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:25,715
Maybe hmmm..

230
00:37:25,716 --> 00:37:28,842
I know after my poor mother
passed away,

231
00:37:28,843 --> 00:37:37,176
you tried to make decisions that were
supposedly in the best interests of the kingdom

232
00:37:38,194 --> 00:37:44,968
or maybe I know about your most
deep and darkest secret

233
00:37:44,969 --> 00:37:52,970
every single servant that passes through
here has to get specially approved by you

234
00:37:58,178 --> 00:38:03,844
I know, I know exactly what you
want.

235
00:38:06,969 --> 00:38:12,182
I know exactly what you
fantasize about

236
00:38:12,183 --> 00:38:20,516
could you imagine a night of pure
pleasure with the king's daughter no less

237
00:38:21,984 --> 00:38:25,633
I mean I know you've been with
almost every servant here

238
00:38:25,634 --> 00:38:27,861
but...

239
00:38:30,986 --> 00:38:34,112
Let me ask you something

240
00:38:34,113 --> 00:38:39,642
when was the last time you saw a
body like this

241
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:45,377
what do you want from me?

242
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,590
Are you going to kill me?

243
00:38:53,715 --> 00:38:57,302
No, but I'm afraid he is.

244
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:11,217
Kayne

245
00:40:11,218 --> 00:40:14,565
follow me

246
00:40:24,981 --> 00:40:31,201
destiny often takes roads that
are unknown to us

247
00:40:31,202 --> 00:40:36,102
only one single person in the
world can follow through a nation

248
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:40,273
that for too long awaits a
solution

249
00:40:40,274 --> 00:40:43,608
that person, is you kayne.

250
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:50,350
And your arrival here in keymock is
a sign that none of us can ignore

251
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:55,348
just as no one must know your
departure

252
00:42:08,168 --> 00:42:14,883
welcome to the second day of the
keymock tournament

253
00:42:22,175 --> 00:42:25,787
to consecrate the greatness of
our king

254
00:42:25,788 --> 00:42:30,763
the first warriors will be val
from the alterious

255
00:42:34,929 --> 00:42:38,266
and teela from romer

256
00:43:58,272 --> 00:44:00,356
clean all this up

257
00:44:00,357 --> 00:44:02,441
let not a trace remain

258
00:44:02,442 --> 00:44:05,569
and not a word to anyone

259
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:10,747
the tournament must go on as
though nothing has happened

260
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:14,574
after all no one is going to
miss her.

261
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:20,134
Except me old friend, I will.

262
00:44:23,259 --> 00:44:28,681
The next fighters are the great
istithias from cornio

263
00:44:28,682 --> 00:44:32,128
and the great hadran from
harcol.

264
00:48:13,892 --> 00:48:15,456
Gunnar

265
00:48:15,457 --> 00:48:17,542
kayne, what are you doing here?

266
00:48:17,543 --> 00:48:19,382
You answer that question

267
00:48:19,384 --> 00:48:21,084
that's my business

268
00:48:21,086 --> 00:48:24,282
shouldn't you be back at the
tournament with your little friend?

269
00:48:24,283 --> 00:48:25,535
I've got a sword to find

270
00:48:25,536 --> 00:48:28,979
you don't know what your getting
yourself into

271
00:48:31,062 --> 00:48:32,416
no!

272
00:48:32,417 --> 00:48:35,475
You don't know what you've done,
don't you understand?

273
00:48:35,476 --> 00:48:39,054
That was the only way to

274
00:48:39,055 --> 00:48:42,181
the sword is mine

275
00:48:42,182 --> 00:48:45,663
who gave you the viewer, you don't
understand that weapons power

276
00:48:50,871 --> 00:48:53,930
get back

277
00:48:54,972 --> 00:48:58,100
kayne, you're a very strong man
with your sword

278
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:02,746
but fight me like a real man, no
weapons

279
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:17,710
I told you hero, should have
stayed down

280
00:51:17,711 --> 00:51:21,066
still playing you two?

281
00:51:40,856 --> 00:51:43,435
Finally

282
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:26,663
beyond the fall

283
00:52:26,664 --> 00:52:29,269
beyond the light

284
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:33,856
beyond time beyond space

285
00:52:33,857 --> 00:52:35,837
the truth

286
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:42,789
that which you are, but you do
not know

287
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:49,357
twins, 2 twins have cost the
queen her life

288
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:55,509
take them away, in opposite
directions

289
00:52:55,510 --> 00:53:03,843
brothers, that's what you are, blood
units you, a pact separates you

290
00:53:06,979 --> 00:53:14,901
only the hands of the sons of the pact
can hold that which must not be seen

291
00:53:14,902 --> 00:53:18,760
the sword with guide your
journey

292
00:53:18,761 --> 00:53:27,093
the sword of the pact with seal that which
must not be seen in the darkness of oblivion

293
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:23,543
hey hey, its over, I am here
with you now

294
00:54:23,544 --> 00:54:27,582
its over, what ever it was

295
00:54:34,874 --> 00:54:39,565
you too were like that moments
ago, what happened

296
00:54:39,566 --> 00:54:44,396
it was a nightmare

297
00:54:44,397 --> 00:54:50,382
it was like something I already
knew

298
00:54:58,715 --> 00:55:01,134
do you want to tell me what's
going on?

299
00:56:46,838 --> 00:56:48,818
Father

300
00:56:48,819 --> 00:56:56,811
luna, excuse me, I just wanted to make sure that
your room here is well worthy of a princess

301
00:56:56,813 --> 00:57:01,538
oh yes it wonderful, just like a
dream

302
00:57:01,539 --> 00:57:04,490
I just want to be prepared for
the rest of the tournament

303
00:57:04,491 --> 00:57:06,543
I cant wait to see how it turns
out

304
00:57:06,544 --> 00:57:08,531
yes of course

305
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:20,583
so, you're the children of king
Wolfkhan, but how?

306
00:57:20,584 --> 00:57:24,442
He kept it hidden from us for a
reason

307
00:57:24,443 --> 00:57:30,801
but what do I know? All I know
is was a lie

308
00:57:30,802 --> 00:57:33,756
but how did you get here?

309
00:57:33,757 --> 00:57:41,506
The night that we were, ahh,
sleeping, I had a visit from Morgan

310
00:57:41,507 --> 00:57:48,734
the witch of my, our, father,
she told me of a sword

311
00:57:48,735 --> 00:57:51,794
and how it would remind me of a
past that would belong to me

312
00:57:51,796 --> 00:57:54,435
and how I was connected to it

313
00:57:54,436 --> 00:58:00,273
she also gave me a crystal viewer, for
which I could overcome the swords power

314
00:58:00,274 --> 00:58:03,853
and she showed me how I could
claim it

315
00:58:03,854 --> 00:58:08,546
the king, the king himself told
me about this sword

316
00:58:08,547 --> 00:58:11,743
it's the only weapon I can use
to win the tournament

317
00:58:11,744 --> 00:58:18,484
and whoever won the tournament,
also takes his kingdom

318
00:58:18,486 --> 00:58:20,883
he sent you here separately

319
00:58:20,884 --> 00:58:24,011
a better chance the sword would
be captured

320
00:58:24,012 --> 00:58:26,656
but what does that sword do?

321
00:58:29,781 --> 00:58:33,186
Find a father

322
00:58:33,187 --> 00:58:34,680
conquer a kingdom

323
00:58:34,681 --> 00:58:38,086
prevent a monster from
conquering the world

324
00:58:38,087 --> 00:58:41,635
well what are we waiting for?

325
01:01:53,862 --> 01:01:56,502
<i>Once you have found the sword</i>

326
01:01:56,503 --> 01:02:00,672
<i>you must search for the two
waterfalls</i>

327
01:02:00,673 --> 01:02:07,971
<i>follow the sun at sunset and
the darkest part of your sole</i>

328
01:02:07,972 --> 01:02:11,064
<i>the doors to hell will close</i>

329
01:02:11,065 --> 01:02:15,721
<i>only the sole asks to go beyond
the entrance</i>

330
01:02:15,722 --> 01:02:21,637
<i>sacrificing his eternity to the
black world of the demons</i>

331
01:03:36,632 --> 01:03:40,732
teela what are you doing?

332
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:43,268
Put the sword down

333
01:03:43,269 --> 01:03:48,481
to prove my love for you I have
followed you to the gates of hell

334
01:03:48,483 --> 01:03:56,815
you must complete our mission if not I
will return and I will show you no mercy

335
01:04:14,272 --> 01:04:16,204
teela, no!

336
01:06:03,019 --> 01:06:05,869
Ahhhh!

337
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:39,019
It's time to go brother, there's
no turning back from here.

338
01:07:23,615 --> 01:07:25,833
Yeah!

339
01:10:39,006 --> 01:10:39,981
Teela.

340
01:10:42,064 --> 01:10:43,630
Teela!

341
01:10:45,714 --> 01:10:47,280
You are alive

342
01:10:49,363 --> 01:10:53,011
my beloved this is how it must
be

343
01:10:53,012 --> 01:10:56,036
I have but a few hours left in
the land of men

344
01:10:56,037 --> 01:10:58,642
I will go and stop har

345
01:10:58,643 --> 01:11:02,179
only a demon can fight another
demon

346
01:13:01,708 --> 01:13:04,350
looking for me father

347
01:13:04,351 --> 01:13:06,436
LA LA luna?

348
01:13:07,478 --> 01:13:10,052
Ye ye yes!

349
01:13:12,136 --> 01:13:16,761
Or maybe you'd prefer to call me
hell.

350
01:13:19,886 --> 01:13:22,502
Father

351
01:13:32,918 --> 01:13:36,060
what is that?

352
01:13:49,601 --> 01:13:55,961
You, you useless coward!

353
01:13:55,962 --> 01:14:01,146
How dare you try and hide your
descendants from me

354
01:14:07,396 --> 01:14:10,869
your game is over human

355
01:14:10,871 --> 01:14:15,488
and now, well now its your
children's turn

356
01:15:20,067 --> 01:15:24,759
how dare you interfere with the
plans of the dark lord

357
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:28,929
I will crush you like the
cockroaches you are

358
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:31,431
victory is mine!

359
01:15:31,432 --> 01:15:34,962
No one stops the coming of
warmond

360
01:18:03,692 --> 01:18:06,263
Donna, what are you doing?

361
01:18:06,264 --> 01:18:08,384
Comeback

362
01:18:08,385 --> 01:18:11,409
know you know what you have to
do my sons

363
01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:19,227
its what you were born for and the reasons I
had you brought up far away and in obscurity

364
01:18:19,228 --> 01:18:23,925
but blood calls and destiny will
be fulfilled

365
01:18:29,133 --> 01:18:30,705
no!

366
01:18:39,038 --> 01:18:40,251
No!

367
01:20:19,203 --> 01:20:21,290
Teela

368
01:20:23,373 --> 01:20:25,392
I knew you'd make it

369
01:20:28,517 --> 01:20:31,125
yes, but at what cost?

370
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:37,239
I cant loose you again.

371
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:41,614
Now you must look after your
people, king of keymock.
