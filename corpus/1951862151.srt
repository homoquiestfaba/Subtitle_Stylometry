<i>...one of the worst wildfire in
Northern California history..</i>

3
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:14,841
<i>...Yesterday firefighters were dispatch
to the eastern edge of the fire...</i>

4
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:18,929
<i>...where wind picked up considerably,
sending embers and flame into the brush...</i>

5
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,878
<i>...and threatening nearby
Hardy County.</i>

6
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:24,632
<i>...over 52000 acres have
been consumed so far.</i>

7
00:02:24,633 --> 00:02:26,004
<i>with no end in sight.</i>

8
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,350
<i>Now, conditions have made it
increasingly difficult to contain...</i>

9
00:02:29,853 --> 00:02:34,895
<i>and high wind continues to spread the
flames at a rate of 260 acres an hour.</i>

10
00:02:34,896 --> 00:02:35,896
Those fires.

11
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,211
<i>Authorities are continuing
the manhunt for Butch Latham.</i>

12
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,525
<i>who escaped from
authority this week.</i>

13
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:20,674
He is considered extremely dangerous
and responsible for rape and murder

14
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:23,845
of 11 known women
in 4 states.

15
00:03:24,174 --> 00:03:26,773
While escaping, he killed an
officer and a prison guard.

16
00:03:27,048 --> 00:03:30,262
<i>If you see this man, do not
approach him. Call the FBI...</i>

17
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:46,225
Need some help?

18
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:48,621
Oh no. I'm just about
finished here. Thanks.

19
00:03:48,886 --> 00:03:51,690
- You work at the prison?
- No. County.

20
00:03:52,122 --> 00:03:56,281
Just gonna, pick up a group doing community
service, taking them up to Grizzly Park.

21
00:03:56,689 --> 00:03:58,880
Pick up all the trash
the visitors left.

22
00:03:59,477 --> 00:04:00,993
It's a new program
this year.

23
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:02,193
New program?

24
00:04:02,228 --> 00:04:05,451
It'll sure will be nice to disappear
in the woods, for a week.

25
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,777
Yeah.
Sure would.

26
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,649
Good morning, Howard.
Good morning, Michael.

27
00:04:23,745 --> 00:04:25,381
Fires are worst
this year.

28
00:04:25,586 --> 00:04:27,072
It's getting drier
and drier.

29
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,604
You know this is the third year
we've had to close the park early.

30
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:32,145
They'll never learn...

31
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,785
You can't throw a lit cigarette
out of a car window!

32
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,852
Yeah I know.

33
00:04:37,426 --> 00:04:38,760
Well, today's
our big day.

34
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:41,574
- Sure hope this program works.
- Yeah.

35
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:43,018
Sure, it'll be
a big help.

36
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,021
Sweet!

37
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,711
Alvavedo

38
00:06:50,191 --> 00:06:53,155
You leave a scratch on it and
I'll kill you, for the better!

39
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:25,015
- Is that the fax from the Sheriff's office?
- Yeah, I got it here.

40
00:07:28,238 --> 00:07:29,044
Listen to this.

41
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:34,770
Prostitution, petty theft,
larceny, computer hacking

42
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:39,352
huffing gas while loitering
and endangering human life...

43
00:07:40,112 --> 00:07:44,421
contributing the delinquency of a minor
and impersonating a police officer.

44
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:50,369
Well, the correction officer
should be picking him up now.

45
00:09:49,691 --> 00:09:50,794
I know, honey.

46
00:09:51,114 --> 00:09:52,593
I got a great idea!

47
00:09:52,628 --> 00:09:55,374
...let's skip Tahiti this
year, let's go camping!

48
00:09:55,939 --> 00:09:58,229
Till I get poison
ivy on my butt!

49
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:00,376
I hope it's not West Nile virus!

50
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,606
cooked over the camp fire...

51
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,796
That would have been lovely, except

52
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:09,445
cause I never got that fly-fishing
lesson you'd give me because...

53
00:10:10,055 --> 00:10:10,912
What was the reason?

54
00:10:11,593 --> 00:10:13,104
Oh, that's right!

55
00:10:14,426 --> 00:10:15,637
I hate bugs!

56
00:10:20,918 --> 00:10:21,823
Poison ivy?

57
00:10:22,937 --> 00:10:23,846
Mosquitoes?

58
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,135
I've never been
to Tahiti!

59
00:10:52,991 --> 00:10:54,336
What the heck
is that noise?

60
00:11:02,277 --> 00:11:03,202
Is this a
gangbang?

61
00:11:05,282 --> 00:11:06,444
Nice car.

62
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:23,978
Put your eyes
back in your head!

63
00:11:25,387 --> 00:11:27,806
Hey! No visitor! You guys
gotta get out of here!

64
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,826
You guys leave!

65
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:34,065
????

66
00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:36,029
He's gorgeous!

67
00:11:37,008 --> 00:11:38,964
This gonna be more
fun that I thought!

68
00:11:40,247 --> 00:11:41,882
Let's go!
Now!

69
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,047
That care of that
white boy hey?

70
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:04,645
Stupid spic.

71
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:08,025
I'm gonna meet
with your girl.

72
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:12,578
You're like a fascist
or something?

73
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:18,343
Something like that.

74
00:12:20,931 --> 00:12:21,651
Ryan.

75
00:12:24,048 --> 00:12:24,941
Scab.

76
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,656
- Sorry
- Idiot!

77
00:12:46,524 --> 00:12:51,548
The West was settled approximately
100,000 grizzlies roamed these lands.

78
00:12:52,023 --> 00:12:52,991
This area at one time

79
00:12:53,115 --> 00:12:56,016
had the second largest population
of grizzlies in the states

80
00:12:56,465 --> 00:13:00,282
This park, the last grizzly
was shot in 1922.

81
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:03,656
The white man offed them just like
they did to the American Indians...

82
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,304
Alright everybody.
Follow me!

83
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:19,739
OK.

84
00:13:19,874 --> 00:13:20,922
Excuse me.

85
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,655
When I call your name,
please identify yourself.

86
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,737
What's your name?

87
00:13:29,491 --> 00:13:30,950
Ranger Mike.

88
00:13:35,099 --> 00:13:36,647
Ryan Forbes III?

89
00:13:37,581 --> 00:13:38,583
Here

90
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:41,728
Ty Brown.

91
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,061
In the house.

92
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:44,959
Sanchez.

93
00:13:46,472 --> 00:13:48,055
Ohla Lola

94
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:53,227
- Candy Re..
- Reese

95
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,990
And I'm right beside you.

96
00:13:57,827 --> 00:13:58,641
Kiki Sato?

97
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,260
It's Sarto.

98
00:14:05,062 --> 00:14:07,308
I guess you'll be...
Baby?

99
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:12,260
- No.
- You'll think they're real?

100
00:14:12,823 --> 00:14:13,793
I think we can
find out!

101
00:14:16,086 --> 00:14:17,536
I'm Bebe.

102
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,117
OK.

103
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,260
Michael White?

104
00:14:22,378 --> 00:14:23,376
Scab.

105
00:14:25,076 --> 00:14:27,679
Scab?
OK.

106
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:30,279
Patrick Collier?

107
00:14:31,427 --> 00:14:34,625
- The name is Trickster.
- OK. Trickster is it.

108
00:14:37,755 --> 00:14:39,239
They all accounted for?

109
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:41,749
Yes sir.

110
00:14:43,937 --> 00:14:46,083
I knew Ranger Mike was
too good to be true!

111
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,153
I see all of you have
your backpacks.

112
00:14:59,342 --> 00:15:00,965
Let's let a look
inside, shall we?

113
00:15:01,388 --> 00:15:03,622
Isn't that like a violation
of our privacy?

114
00:15:04,342 --> 00:15:05,461
Yes, it is..

115
00:15:06,556 --> 00:15:07,871
This is bullshit!

116
00:15:09,344 --> 00:15:12,526
I'm aware that education
is lacking in this country...

117
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,278
but I will not tolerate
bad language.

118
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:16,966
Understood?

119
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:21,983
- Bebe, could we take a look inside?
- Sure, go ahead!

120
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,371
Here!

121
00:15:23,696 --> 00:15:26,644
I've never been camping before, but
I've packed everything I thought I need.

122
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:32,420
- What is that?
- Oh my God!

123
00:15:32,774 --> 00:15:35,390
- It's Mr. Vupi!
- Are you kidding me?

124
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,819
- Yeah right!
- Bebe.

125
00:15:54,783 --> 00:15:59,482
Ok, I'll take it, none of you have
ever really been camping before...

126
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,049
or bother to read the
list of things to bring!

127
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:03,729
or wear!

128
00:16:04,954 --> 00:16:06,819
Where is the officer that
brought you up here?

129
00:16:07,015 --> 00:16:08,191
Right here!

130
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,262
I assume the bag would
be check for weapons?

131
00:16:11,906 --> 00:16:13,943
Yeah, the...
checking.

132
00:16:14,522 --> 00:16:15,662
What happened there?

133
00:16:16,012 --> 00:16:19,715
I had a tire blew out on
the way to the pickup.

134
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,091
Spilled my? all over myself.

135
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,297
You gonna wanna change that
shirt, it’s an animal magnet.

136
00:16:29,886 --> 00:16:31,502
- I'm Ranger Bob...
- Jerry Stuart...

137
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,537
Mike, brief Jerry on
the week schedules

138
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:35,779
show him the gears.

139
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:38,553
and get him acquainted with the
map to the route he's going up on.

140
00:16:38,854 --> 00:16:39,613
Welcome aboard.

141
00:16:40,773 --> 00:16:44,394
Now you'll all need to pay close
attention to this orientation.

142
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,219
Now, I am not
your babysitter.

143
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,024
To be quite honest, if you do
not follow my instructions...

144
00:16:50,903 --> 00:16:52,744
I will not be
responsible for you.

145
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,254
Jerry there can,
but I won’t!

146
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:59,403
There are certain precautions that all
of you must take while we are on this trip.

147
00:17:00,276 --> 00:17:02,497
Now, there are obviously,
there are wild animals out there.

148
00:17:02,665 --> 00:17:07,019
We have like black bears, coyotes,
wolves, as well as timber rattlers.

149
00:17:07,604 --> 00:17:10,985
This point is, any of these
animals can kill you!

150
00:17:11,389 --> 00:17:13,738
- These animals are aggressive.
- He's just trying to scare us.

151
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,691
The reason I wanted to
look into your backpack

152
00:17:15,774 --> 00:17:18,793
was because there are certain
items that attracts these animals

153
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:23,933
No matter how cute an animal might
appear to be, do not feed them!

154
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:25,572
Alright?

155
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,461
Wolves were reintroduced
to the park some 4 years ago

156
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,092
unfortunately the
neighboring ranchers

157
00:17:31,109 --> 00:17:33,861
were not very happy
about this arrangement.

158
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:35,906
and as a result, we have
found several wolves traps

159
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,242
all around the park.

160
00:17:37,443 --> 00:17:39,858
These are very nasty items.

161
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,819
I can assure you do not
want to step on one of these

162
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,136
So it is imperative, that you remain
on the trails that we have selected

163
00:17:48,921 --> 00:17:50,589
and we stay together
as a group.

164
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,235
Should any of you decide
to wander off on your own.

165
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:56,980
Be forewarned. I am not
the good sherppard

166
00:17:57,124 --> 00:17:59,344
I will not leave the others
to come looking for you.

167
00:17:59,684 --> 00:18:01,621
You will be
on your own!

168
00:18:01,656 --> 00:18:03,738
How do you know we don’t
have go looking for you?

169
00:18:04,337 --> 00:18:05,428
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

170
00:18:05,811 --> 00:18:10,586
Frankly. I'm not sure that any of
you would survive, on your own!

171
00:18:11,766 --> 00:18:13,179
So, is that clear?

172
00:18:13,474 --> 00:18:15,865
- Crystal.
- Yes Sir!

173
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:20,281
It's important for you to
understand that nature

174
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,255
This place,
is sacred.

175
00:18:24,151 --> 00:18:27,447
You will respect it, or there
will be consequences.

176
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:35,415
- You ever licked a frog?
- What?

177
00:18:38,071 --> 00:18:39,306
No!

178
00:18:41,506 --> 00:18:43,393
- The bathroom's better this way.
- OK!

179
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:53,248
Have a nice night.
That's a good idea in these woods.

180
00:18:53,861 --> 00:18:55,375
I'll be right back.
OK?

181
00:19:03,357 --> 00:19:05,933
I'll show you our route as
well as poisonous snakes

182
00:19:05,968 --> 00:19:08,277
and plant leave that you
should stay away from.

183
00:19:13,503 --> 00:19:14,685
We are here.

184
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:17,090
We will hike up
Falling Rock today...

185
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,997
...and camp in Tumbling
Creek Falls, that's here.

186
00:19:20,518 --> 00:19:22,708
Tomorrow, if we'll put
in a full day of hiking

187
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:25,207
we'll reach the second ridge,
which will be our base camp.

188
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,539
On the first night,
we'll camp in tents.

189
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,462
Young lady, that is a very
poor choice of footwear.

190
00:19:32,768 --> 00:19:34,052
Poor choice?

191
00:19:35,617 --> 00:19:36,982
These were $300.

192
00:19:37,996 --> 00:19:40,344
You're not going up in those.
What else did you bring?

193
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:42,975
Well, I could have
another pair.

194
00:19:43,918 --> 00:19:45,380
How about these?

195
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,326
Those are not
gonna work.

196
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:49,084
I got these if
you're a size 8

197
00:19:49,311 --> 00:19:50,233
You’re kidding right?

198
00:19:50,698 --> 00:19:54,553
If they fit, take them.
If not, you will not go.

199
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:58,080
Fine.
I'm a size 8.

200
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:03,004
What would we do,
if we see a grizzly bear?

201
00:20:03,623 --> 00:20:05,223
You know, any kind of bear.

202
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,844
Well, most people would run, which
would be the worst thing you can to do.

203
00:20:09,402 --> 00:20:12,476
- I'd run.
- You never outrun a bear, son.

204
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,391
They can run 30-35
miles per hour

205
00:20:16,178 --> 00:20:17,429
I don't have to
outrun the bear.

206
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,515
I'd just have
to outrun you!

207
00:20:21,774 --> 00:20:22,498
So... Are

208
00:20:22,647 --> 00:20:24,516
What do you do, if
you do see a bear?

209
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,707
You spotted a bear and
he's not seeing you yet.

210
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:31,182
You quickly and quietly
get away from it.

211
00:20:31,183 --> 00:20:34,085
If you have been spotted, you
don't make sudden movement.

212
00:20:34,096 --> 00:20:36,619
You'll begin speaking,
very softly...

213
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:39,167
and it will help the bear
will identify, what you are.

214
00:20:39,578 --> 00:20:41,493
Yeah.
Dinner.

215
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,489
Bears are also getting
ready for habitation

216
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:46,712
so they'll be gorging
themselves this time of year.

217
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,845
I saw one of those
nature shows

218
00:20:48,018 --> 00:20:52,401
I thought it said, your suppose to make
yourself big, make loud noise and scare it.

219
00:20:53,081 --> 00:20:54,839
I would suggest
you not do that.

220
00:20:54,972 --> 00:20:57,786
The bear would consider
that confrontational behavior

221
00:20:57,797 --> 00:21:01,680
...and trust me, you do not
want a confrontation with him!

222
00:21:03,613 --> 00:21:04,421
Whatever!

223
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:05,942
I'll cap that ass.

224
00:21:06,471 --> 00:21:07,318
Let's move

225
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:15,630
Hey, what's that?

226
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,416
It's a GPS system. I'm just
programming where'd be going.

227
00:21:18,621 --> 00:21:19,614
You think it matters?

228
00:21:19,974 --> 00:21:20,830
It doesn't.

229
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,058
Pick up the trash
you'll see.

230
00:21:43,572 --> 00:21:47,240
So here's your radio and don't
forget to change that shirt OK?

231
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,243
Hey. Mister Ranger Sir!

232
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,515
Ranger Bob.

233
00:21:58,196 --> 00:22:00,664
Not Mister
Ranger Sir!

234
00:22:02,867 --> 00:22:04,013
How about
Sponge Bob?

235
00:22:05,207 --> 00:22:07,786
- What if we call you by your last name?
- Ranger Bob!

236
00:22:08,697 --> 00:22:11,460
- Bob?
- Bob!

237
00:22:11,936 --> 00:22:13,284
Your last name
is Bob?

238
00:22:15,941 --> 00:22:18,279
Oh. so you're
Bob-Bob?

239
00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:22,228
John... William... Bob!

240
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:24,101
Ranger Bob!

241
00:22:25,694 --> 00:22:27,531
Oh.

242
00:22:32,587 --> 00:22:34,577
I've almost forgot what
I was gonna ask him.

243
00:22:45,579 --> 00:22:48,055
So there should be plenty of food and water
up there, for you guys for the week, OK?

244
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:50,841
You guys have any problems,
just give me a call on the radio.

245
00:22:53,586 --> 00:22:57,382
Michael, parking lots cleared out,
I'll pull the gate behind me and lock it.

246
00:22:57,522 --> 00:22:59,261
- OK, thanks Howard
- You bet!

247
00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:07,932
- So the park is closing?
- Yeah, till next spring.

248
00:23:08,683 --> 00:23:10,301
Normally, we don't close
till November, but...

249
00:23:10,565 --> 00:23:14,637
fires are so bad this year that,
firefighters can't cover all this parks.

250
00:23:15,073 --> 00:23:18,989
We're one of the first to shut down
just because how remote we are.

251
00:23:19,229 --> 00:23:22,450
- So everyone’s gone?
- Yes, well except me.

252
00:23:22,706 --> 00:23:24,894
I'll be here in case if you or
Ranger Bob needs anything.

253
00:23:25,197 --> 00:23:27,170
I'd sure appreciate all
your help Ranger Mike

254
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:49,137
It's sure is beautiful,
Ranger Bob

255
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:56,848
Here too!

256
00:24:00,202 --> 00:24:02,491
Yes Bebe.
It's sure is.

257
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,125
What is this place?

258
00:24:47,346 --> 00:24:49,735
OK folks, let's take
a little break.

259
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,981
- I feels to tired!
- Amazing.

260
00:24:52,266 --> 00:24:54,789
Oh goodie, a
picnic table!

261
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:05,678
- My feet’s are killing me!
- Hey, what's you got there?

262
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:10,825
Tremendous.
Tit-fallious.

263
00:25:12,482 --> 00:25:15,939
- Could be nature at its best
- Yeah... Maybe... No!

264
00:25:21,647 --> 00:25:24,302
Please dispose of the
wrappers properly.

265
00:25:27,616 --> 00:25:33,612
- Ranger Bob, if a girl wants to tinkle?
- She would go her little ways off.

266
00:25:34,175 --> 00:25:37,085
and go behind the
bush or a tree.

267
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,995
- Oh OK!
- Watch out for poison oak.

268
00:25:40,426 --> 00:25:44,404
- The leaves I showed you?
- OK!

269
00:25:50,597 --> 00:25:52,316
Down boy!

270
00:25:57,629 --> 00:25:58,529
Is that girl
for real?

271
00:26:20,337 --> 00:26:21,341
Listen to this!

272
00:26:27,132 --> 00:26:28,031
Hey.

273
00:26:30,282 --> 00:26:31,355
Check this out.

274
00:26:59,373 --> 00:27:01,147
Oh. look how
cute you are!

275
00:27:03,107 --> 00:27:05,057
Here kitty, kitty!

276
00:27:05,305 --> 00:27:06,084
Here

277
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,034
Good baby

278
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:20,306
You're hungry
aren't you?

279
00:27:21,286 --> 00:27:22,497
Well, that's all now.

280
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:25,042
Bye. Nice to
meet you.

281
00:27:25,665 --> 00:27:26,461
Bye

282
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:37,364
Great. No reception!

283
00:27:38,566 --> 00:27:40,252
Cellular phones
don't work up here.

284
00:27:40,253 --> 00:27:41,453
There's no service.

285
00:27:41,896 --> 00:27:45,282
Besides, you're not allow to have
those on this little excursion.

286
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,250
You're joking?

287
00:27:51,634 --> 00:27:53,161
Could it get
any worse?

288
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,433
Yo, Ranger Bob!

289
00:27:57,396 --> 00:28:00,637
I was kind of evaluating the
path you have us going on...

290
00:28:00,747 --> 00:28:03,032
...and I think there a
shorter, easier way.

291
00:28:03,471 --> 00:28:05,556
- You think?
- Yeah.

292
00:28:06,563 --> 00:28:07,995
You the computer whiz?

293
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,459
Clear your credit, clear out
your bank account any minute.

294
00:28:13,116 --> 00:28:14,043
Just joking.

295
00:28:14,078 --> 00:28:18,140
This is a navigation system and it's
showing that, we can save like 2 hours.

296
00:28:18,652 --> 00:28:22,329
Son, the path you’re talking about, is too
close to the ranchers surrounding the park.

297
00:28:23,103 --> 00:28:26,407
You remember that little talk
we had, about nasty wolves traps?

298
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,707
Yes.

299
00:28:27,742 --> 00:28:30,287
But if we're careful and I'm
sure you know the way

300
00:28:30,396 --> 00:28:32,023
We'll stay
on course!

301
00:28:37,017 --> 00:28:38,765
He's trying to
torture us!

302
00:28:47,316 --> 00:28:49,205
Alright, let's
get going.

303
00:28:52,753 --> 00:28:57,867
OK, everyone be very
quiet and do not move!

304
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,551
Bebe.

305
00:29:02,984 --> 00:29:05,311
Did you feed
your new friend?

306
00:29:11,326 --> 00:29:12,614
Guys, it's
disgusting.

307
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:15,284
My eyes are
burning!

308
00:29:16,395 --> 00:29:17,710
Get the hell away
from my Bebe!

309
00:29:17,873 --> 00:29:18,641
I'm gonna
throw up.

310
00:29:19,978 --> 00:29:21,706
This is so gross!

311
00:29:23,608 --> 00:29:26,549
This is why we do not
feed the animals!

312
00:29:28,211 --> 00:29:30,351
The stinging in your eyes
will stop shortly

313
00:29:31,287 --> 00:29:34,679
as far as the smell, there's not alot of
thing we can do about that right now.

314
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:41,158
Kiki. I wouldn't advise screaming
again, when you see a wild animal.

315
00:29:41,723 --> 00:29:45,013
- Bebe?
- I thought it was a forest cat.

316
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:48,041
Stay down with
the rest of us.

317
00:30:20,215 --> 00:30:21,677
Jerry... It's Bob.
Do you copy?

318
00:30:22,895 --> 00:30:25,351
Jerry here.
I'm at the campsite now.

319
00:30:26,093 --> 00:30:27,463
Dropping off the gears.

320
00:30:28,616 --> 00:30:29,566
Roger that.

321
00:30:53,177 --> 00:30:56,663
OK, here's some soap,
this should help with the smell.

322
00:30:58,066 --> 00:30:59,341
Falls right down there.

323
00:30:59,997 --> 00:31:02,673
- Thanks, Ranger Bob.
- Your welcome.

324
00:31:04,843 --> 00:31:06,611
Go get cleaned.

325
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:27,834
Need any help,
Ranger Bob?

326
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,234
Goodness, Bebe, you
must be freezing?

327
00:32:39,448 --> 00:32:41,730
I'm gonna go setup
that last tent.

328
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:45,042
I can help!.

329
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:33,273
We still stink,
Ranger Bob!

330
00:34:33,862 --> 00:34:35,234
Yes, Candy you do.

331
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:38,022
In order not to contaminate
your other clothes

332
00:34:38,164 --> 00:34:41,210
all of you will wear the same
one tomorrow as you did today

333
00:34:42,802 --> 00:34:44,924
You want us to put
those clothes back on?

334
00:34:45,378 --> 00:34:48,914
Yes, unless you want to
smell like a skunk all week.

335
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,737
- That's so gross!
- I'm really sorry I didn't know.

336
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:08,148
Excuse me

337
00:35:09,618 --> 00:35:12,798
Hey Bebe, maybe you
could make it up to me?

338
00:35:13,419 --> 00:35:16,436
They're talking about making
us sleep in our own tent.

339
00:35:17,552 --> 00:35:18,976
I don't think so.

340
00:35:24,113 --> 00:35:25,451
Nice job, Scab.

341
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:29,212
A white power tattoo,
sitting next to a black man.

342
00:35:29,476 --> 00:35:30,423
Well done son.

343
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:40,023
Gotta drain the dragon!

344
00:35:41,965 --> 00:35:43,634
You have a dragon?

345
00:35:44,172 --> 00:35:45,738
I love dragons.

346
00:35:52,415 --> 00:35:55,217
F.Y.I. Ranger Bob.
The food sucks!

347
00:35:55,845 --> 00:35:57,421
I couldn't even eat mine!

348
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,784
Well, maybe it wouldn't have burned

349
00:36:00,947 --> 00:36:06,369
if anyone of you have bothered to
stir it while I was putting up the tents.

350
00:36:07,425 --> 00:36:09,993
- I helped you
- Yes, you did Bebe

351
00:36:10,332 --> 00:36:11,141
Thank you.

352
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:16,747
Let's talk about what each one of
you want to accomplish this week

353
00:36:16,994 --> 00:36:18,698
What do you mean, accomplish?

354
00:36:19,693 --> 00:36:22,314
Like maybe reflecting
why you ended up here?

355
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:27,181
Finding redemption, maybe
even forgiveness?

356
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:30,411
- Spider!
- Raul

357
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:38,841
Actually this is pretty close in size
and color to our spiders here.

358
00:36:39,437 --> 00:36:41,829
mostly found in trees.

359
00:36:42,573 --> 00:36:45,258
- Spiders?
- His kidding right?

360
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:50,161
You know what? I think it's
time for us all to turn in.

361
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:53,811
Men in one tent,
ladies in the other.

362
00:37:17,832 --> 00:37:19,977
Jerry. Ranger Bob here.
Do you copy?

363
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:26,210
Jerry.
Ranger Bob.

364
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:09,409
To hell with him.

365
00:38:40,813 --> 00:38:41,709
Crap.

366
00:38:44,068 --> 00:38:45,677
What the hell was that?

367
00:39:45,005 --> 00:39:48,033
Look! I'm drowning
the little suckers

368
00:39:50,723 --> 00:39:53,941
I'd be careful standing
so close to those fire ants

369
00:39:58,577 --> 00:39:59,508
Whoa

370
00:40:00,623 --> 00:40:01,984
Sorry about that.

371
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,849
Let's go!

372
00:40:15,643 --> 00:40:17,547
So those little
sucker bite?

373
00:41:05,271 --> 00:41:06,843
OK, I don't like cheating last time!

374
00:41:06,878 --> 00:41:09,693
You don't understand,
I'm in the middle of nowhere right now man

375
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:12,794
those old people have their
cheque and cash for them. Listen!

376
00:41:13,367 --> 00:41:14,837
- Alright
- Is this how it works?

377
00:41:15,861 --> 00:41:17,442
I gotta go.
What?

378
00:41:17,676 --> 00:41:20,606
- How did you get your phone to work?
- I got a booster for the signal

379
00:41:21,135 --> 00:41:22,494
Let me make a call!

380
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:25,134
Now why would I want to
do anything for you?

381
00:41:27,143 --> 00:41:28,871
I could tell Ranger Bob!

382
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:32,999
Alright 10 minutes... hang back
so nobody can hear you OK?

383
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,616
You'll make it
up to me later.

384
00:41:40,813 --> 00:41:42,362
Elaina.
It's me.

385
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:50,353
After lunch, I'm going the GPS system as
the saying goes and beat him by 2 hours.

386
00:41:51,169 --> 00:41:52,552
Ranger Bob
will be mad!

387
00:41:53,455 --> 00:41:55,644
What he's gonna to say when I beat
him there like 2 hours or more?

388
00:41:56,334 --> 00:41:57,254
Nothing!

389
00:42:03,597 --> 00:42:04,515
OK. Goodbye.

390
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:12,088
I don't think you've
all given us your best.

391
00:42:12,394 --> 00:42:15,567
The trash you've missed now, we've just
gonna have to pick up on the way down.

392
00:42:17,142 --> 00:42:19,670
- Is there any downhill?
- After the uphill.

393
00:42:21,812 --> 00:42:22,603
Let's go.

394
00:42:28,237 --> 00:42:29,372
OK. North.

395
00:42:31,887 --> 00:42:33,919
East. South.

396
00:43:19,289 --> 00:43:20,524
Find that,
Ranger Bob.

397
00:43:22,179 --> 00:43:23,200
We're definitely sent
to the top right?

398
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,204
Oh yeah.

399
00:43:25,785 --> 00:43:26,812
So what'd you do?

400
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,602
Poisoned my mother

401
00:43:30,351 --> 00:43:31,063
Really?

402
00:43:32,231 --> 00:43:34,072
Not like I wanted to
kill her or anything.

403
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:36,313
So about 2 years
less of college.

404
00:43:37,842 --> 00:43:39,145
Why'd you poison her?

405
00:43:40,687 --> 00:43:43,923
She'd just ragged
on me all the time.

406
00:43:45,141 --> 00:43:47,083
About buying too
many clothes.

407
00:43:47,517 --> 00:43:49,078
My studies.

408
00:43:49,372 --> 00:43:50,344
My friends.

409
00:43:50,935 --> 00:43:52,966
So you thought you'd give her
something else to think about?

410
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:54,745
Yeah.

411
00:43:55,723 --> 00:43:57,484
Hey, it worked for
almost a year.

412
00:43:58,947 --> 00:44:00,987
She always thought
she had the flu.

413
00:44:02,985 --> 00:44:04,282
Until the bleeding started.

414
00:44:05,568 --> 00:44:07,301
Must have been
internally or something.

415
00:44:07,976 --> 00:44:09,390
You're not in jail?

416
00:44:10,687 --> 00:44:12,151
My mother never
told on me.

417
00:44:13,796 --> 00:44:15,434
They just got me
stealing the poison.

418
00:44:24,725 --> 00:44:26,376
Just pick that up.

419
00:44:26,811 --> 00:44:28,467
Alright, let's pick
up the pace!

420
00:44:28,941 --> 00:44:29,917
Let's go...

421
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,575
Ouch!

422
00:45:01,248 --> 00:45:02,618
- You OK?
- Yeah.

423
00:45:03,503 --> 00:45:04,696
Oh my god!

424
00:45:07,825 --> 00:45:09,214
- Sorry
- OK.

425
00:45:12,856 --> 00:45:13,783
You hear that?

426
00:45:14,735 --> 00:45:15,779
What was that?

427
00:45:21,442 --> 00:45:23,312
Don't even mess around
with me like that, OK?

428
00:45:23,877 --> 00:45:24,892
So what'd you do?

429
00:45:26,237 --> 00:45:27,971
I used to part time at
this older care place

430
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:30,685
Got these old geezers
to trust me.

431
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:33,786
Stole their social security
cheques, their money..

432
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:35,738
and take their medications

433
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:37,870
and I'd replace them with placebo.

434
00:45:41,732 --> 00:45:43,903
These two old guys...
they died on me.

435
00:45:44,972 --> 00:45:47,467
- And you didn't go to jail?
- No.

436
00:45:47,767 --> 00:45:50,465
You see, the cops. They searched
me without a warrant.

437
00:45:50,684 --> 00:45:51,905
The case was thrown out.

438
00:45:55,844 --> 00:45:56,771
Your were lucky.

439
00:45:57,935 --> 00:45:59,338
I was smart!

440
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:01,957
It was alright, while
it lasted you know.

441
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:04,033
Got a good scam
plan now though.

442
00:46:05,018 --> 00:46:06,379
Maybe you could help me?

443
00:46:06,919 --> 00:46:08,392
You see, old people...

444
00:46:08,965 --> 00:46:10,443
they're so vulnerable.

445
00:46:10,706 --> 00:46:11,548
They're the perfect target.

446
00:46:12,077 --> 00:46:14,206
Nobody gives a rat's
ass about them.

447
00:46:16,084 --> 00:46:17,592
They're just taking up space.

448
00:46:18,135 --> 00:46:19,531
And natural resources.

449
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,008
Old people are creepy

450
00:46:50,856 --> 00:46:51,592
Madam.

451
00:46:51,927 --> 00:46:53,592
I thought you said we'd
suppose to be there by now?

452
00:46:53,918 --> 00:46:54,867
Just right up here.

453
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,271
Wait here.

454
00:48:05,451 --> 00:48:06,880
Jerry.

455
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:52,087
You stink so bad!

456
00:48:52,731 --> 00:48:55,000
No shit!
So do you!

457
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:57,105
You know, I could
really use a beer.

458
00:48:58,026 --> 00:48:59,129
I could drink one!

459
00:49:21,078 --> 00:49:22,495
We're not lost right?

460
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:24,210
No, it's just right up here.

461
00:49:27,606 --> 00:49:29,550
It's been more
than 10 minutes!

462
00:49:30,088 --> 00:49:31,782
"more than 10 minutes"

463
00:49:32,593 --> 00:49:35,702
If a tree fall in a forest,
do you hear the tree?

464
00:49:36,398 --> 00:49:37,403
How do you know it’s
more than 10 minute?

465
00:49:37,647 --> 00:49:39,471
Can you tell the time by
the sun or something!

466
00:49:39,506 --> 00:49:40,794
Yeah, actually...

467
00:49:41,709 --> 00:49:43,055
Can I have some of that?

468
00:49:43,576 --> 00:49:44,677
No.

469
00:49:49,268 --> 00:49:52,779
Did anybody happened to notice
when Ty and Kiki left us?

470
00:49:56,603 --> 00:49:58,556
OK.

471
00:50:02,043 --> 00:50:03,290
Where are they?

472
00:50:04,186 --> 00:50:05,421
Where's the camp?

473
00:50:08,853 --> 00:50:10,441
You don't know where
we are do you?

474
00:50:11,315 --> 00:50:12,676
- We're in the woods, baby!
- What?

475
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,909
It's not funny.
Ty!

476
00:50:16,242 --> 00:50:18,785
Look, stop tripping alright!
It's just right over there. Come on!

477
00:50:19,773 --> 00:50:22,686
You told me the camp,
was on this mountain top!

478
00:50:23,996 --> 00:50:26,093
- The co-ordinates are off a little bit.
- Ty!

479
00:50:27,513 --> 00:50:28,751
This isn't funny!

480
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:34,482
Should we get there
before dark?

481
00:50:34,854 --> 00:50:37,393
Yeah, let's just cut
through here.

482
00:50:43,503 --> 00:50:45,571
My legs!
Argh Man!

483
00:50:47,766 --> 00:50:49,209
Kiki, help me, Kiki!

484
00:50:55,328 --> 00:50:57,142
- Oh God!
- It's definitely broken!

485
00:50:57,661 --> 00:50:59,464
OK, Get my phone,
get my cell phone!

486
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:01,646
Give me my phone!

487
00:51:03,353 --> 00:51:05,310
- Candy has it!
- Argh... man!

488
00:51:05,873 --> 00:51:07,040
????

489
00:51:08,562 --> 00:51:12,154
Help, somebody help!

490
00:51:12,475 --> 00:51:13,715
My legs are killing me.

491
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:18,655
<i>Go back.</i>

492
00:51:20,801 --> 00:51:21,577
<i>Go back</i>

493
00:51:23,779 --> 00:51:24,609
<i>Go back</i>

494
00:51:26,891 --> 00:51:27,711
<i>Go back</i>

495
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,435
<i>Go back</i>

496
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:34,641
<i>Go back</i>

497
00:51:35,304 --> 00:51:38,506
- Scream.
- Help!

498
00:51:39,598 --> 00:51:41,127
- Help!
- Help!

499
00:51:41,424 --> 00:51:42,395
- Somebody gotta hear us.
- Please.

500
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:46,898
- Help!
- Help!

501
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:54,831
OK. Girls cabin to the
right, boys to the left.

502
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:56,224
No mixing, no swapping.

503
00:51:56,618 --> 00:52:00,200
This is Skunk-Off. It will
help with the smell.

504
00:52:00,495 --> 00:52:02,170
You'll have 1 hour to shower and relax.

505
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:04,901
After that you'll have a few
chores to do before it gets dark.

506
00:52:05,681 --> 00:52:07,020
Alright put your packs away.

507
00:52:10,862 --> 00:52:11,732
????

508
00:52:16,093 --> 00:52:17,173
I was in juvenile.

509
00:52:17,881 --> 00:52:18,688
Is that why you're here?

510
00:52:20,193 --> 00:52:23,505
No, it was stupid. I was at
a "gang related"...

511
00:52:23,744 --> 00:52:25,630
shooting incident.

512
00:52:27,103 --> 00:52:28,427
But they don't have shit on me.

513
00:52:28,572 --> 00:52:30,191
I was just there.

514
00:52:30,534 --> 00:52:34,574
Could you imagine a conversation
between Scab and Bebe?

515
00:52:34,906 --> 00:52:36,894
- Could you call that a conversation?
- No.

516
00:52:37,218 --> 00:52:39,827
"Scab, have you ever made it a bear?"

517
00:52:40,475 --> 00:52:43,650
"Have you ever like licked a frog?"

518
00:52:45,355 --> 00:52:47,219
Idiots... they're all idiots

519
00:52:49,682 --> 00:52:51,378
That bitch Candy says one word to me

520
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:53,268
she would leave this camp alive!

521
00:52:57,942 --> 00:53:01,817
- Lola Huh?
- My housekeeper name's Lola.

522
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:07,250
I'll rather see you
after the showers.

523
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:09,090
Definitely.

524
00:53:41,216 --> 00:53:42,067
Gentlemen...

525
00:53:42,102 --> 00:53:45,661
Here is a list of things, that
need to be done before dark.

526
00:53:48,757 --> 00:53:54,237
- Wash out all dirty clothes and hang...
- Hang them up.

527
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:57,987
Empty all candy bars, energy bars
from backpacks or persons.

528
00:53:58,347 --> 00:54:02,717
Turn in all food products, all deodorant,
and scented products, to be bagged.

529
00:54:05,223 --> 00:54:06,966
How else can we get
into town Ranger Bob?

530
00:54:09,979 --> 00:54:11,626
Are you trying to sell our stuff?

531
00:54:12,142 --> 00:54:15,214
Just give me any food
products you might have.

532
00:54:16,728 --> 00:54:17,536
I don't have anything?

533
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,044
Me either.

534
00:54:24,001 --> 00:54:27,866
Fine. You wanna be bait.
Be bait.

535
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:33,323
Bait.
Did he just say bait?

536
00:54:33,991 --> 00:54:36,456
- He's weird man.
- Yeah.

537
00:54:37,689 --> 00:54:38,952
I'm losing blood.

538
00:54:41,792 --> 00:54:43,593
Shit.

539
00:54:45,249 --> 00:54:46,713
The blood!

540
00:54:50,138 --> 00:54:51,634
Won't that attract
the animals?

541
00:54:57,857 --> 00:54:59,551
- What?
- Look...

542
00:55:01,051 --> 00:55:03,485
Turn me around.
I wanna see...

543
00:55:04,773 --> 00:55:06,106
Argh... Slow!

544
00:55:09,221 --> 00:55:11,088
There!
Can't you see?

545
00:55:16,594 --> 00:55:18,832
OK. Wait...
Wait...

546
00:55:19,348 --> 00:55:21,754
- Oh No!
- Wait... Wait!

547
00:55:23,322 --> 00:55:24,521
Kiki, don't run!

548
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:30,825
Oh God!

549
00:55:31,095 --> 00:55:31,937
No!

550
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:33,749
No!

551
00:55:36,386 --> 00:55:37,133
Kiki!

552
00:55:42,251 --> 00:55:43,361
Kiki!

553
00:55:45,871 --> 00:55:46,892
Bebe!

554
00:55:48,889 --> 00:55:50,211
- Get out of here!
- Alright!

555
00:55:52,023 --> 00:55:53,585
Like I haven't seen that before.

556
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:06,808
Hi.

557
00:56:15,225 --> 00:56:16,513
Too perfect.

558
00:56:16,514 --> 00:56:17,514
My vote's fake.

559
00:56:20,753 --> 00:56:23,144
However, one touch.

560
00:56:23,499 --> 00:56:25,646
- So touch them?
- Hey, Bebe!

561
00:56:26,273 --> 00:56:28,441
Are your tatas silicone?

562
00:56:29,692 --> 00:56:31,007
Sili... what?

563
00:56:34,109 --> 00:56:35,215
Unbelievable!

564
00:56:35,669 --> 00:56:36,775
She doesn't even know
what we're talking about.

565
00:56:36,802 --> 00:56:38,135
That's pretty amazing!

566
00:56:38,897 --> 00:56:42,064
Who cares...
I just want them!

567
00:56:45,191 --> 00:56:48,124
Please, somebody help me!

568
00:56:50,679 --> 00:56:53,073
I thought that correctional officer
guy was suppose to be here too?

569
00:56:54,556 --> 00:56:57,070
He was kinda gross...
He smelled...

570
00:56:57,452 --> 00:56:58,736
Yeah. Where is officer Jerry?

571
00:56:59,595 --> 00:57:01,131
I'm guessing miscommunication

572
00:57:01,547 --> 00:57:04,752
or he just didn't want to
spend the week with all of you.

573
00:57:05,743 --> 00:57:08,104
Or maybe he forgot to hang
his food and the bear got him.

574
00:57:08,392 --> 00:57:10,553
- Yeah!
- That's awful!

575
00:57:12,511 --> 00:57:14,155
I can't believe how hungry I was!

576
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:17,788
- That's the mountains...
- The chicken was really good, Ranger Bob!

577
00:57:18,333 --> 00:57:20,906
Yes, Bebe... it was nice
of you to help out.

578
00:57:21,831 --> 00:57:24,575
It was walking for 2 days, probably
taste like shit. We just couldn't tell.

579
00:57:27,019 --> 00:57:29,357
I'll eat it.
I'll eat it then.

580
00:57:31,774 --> 00:57:34,616
You know they gave me
these files on all of you.

581
00:57:35,193 --> 00:57:39,672
and seeing Jerry isn't here,
I thought we should talk about

582
00:57:39,921 --> 00:57:41,272
what brought each of you here...

583
00:57:42,393 --> 00:57:43,725
You have the files, just read them.

584
00:57:44,146 --> 00:57:45,419
don't wanna talk about them.

585
00:57:45,885 --> 00:57:48,410
Actually Candy, yours was on top.

586
00:57:50,373 --> 00:57:53,160
So I got paid for sex.
Big deal!

587
00:57:53,659 --> 00:57:56,254
Prada, Jimmy Choo,
Chanel are expensive.

588
00:57:57,413 --> 00:57:58,634
A girl need her accessories.

589
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:09,566
I am not going to wear the wrong shoes just
because my daddy wanna buy them for me.

590
00:58:11,009 --> 00:58:15,339
If all fashion at right now and Gucci has
this black shoe, that's just gorgeous.

591
00:58:16,355 --> 00:58:18,960
So you do this for
fashion accessories?

592
00:58:20,381 --> 00:58:21,589
Mostly...

593
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,359
Hey, I get 5000 a night!

594
00:58:26,661 --> 00:58:30,081
Some guy pays you $5000
to sleep with them?

595
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:33,811
- You got to be kidding me?
- Nope!

596
00:58:34,689 --> 00:58:35,952
I got 5 bucks.

597
00:58:36,985 --> 00:58:38,181
I'll give 6 for you.

598
00:58:41,163 --> 00:58:43,290
I need to go to the little girl's room.
You want to come with me Ryan?

599
00:58:43,736 --> 00:58:45,599
Not on my watch!

600
00:58:48,046 --> 00:58:51,894
Bebe, would you go with
Candy to the restroom please.

601
00:58:52,099 --> 00:58:53,167
Sure.

602
00:58:54,503 --> 00:58:55,857
You're really are no fun,
Ranger Bob.

603
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:04,554
So 5000 just walked by.

604
00:59:07,397 --> 00:59:10,616
Ryan, how about you?

605
00:59:11,193 --> 00:59:12,538
Yeah, Ryan the third.

606
00:59:14,535 --> 00:59:16,206
Corruption of a minor.

607
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:17,967
You got caught?

608
00:59:18,441 --> 00:59:21,953
Yeah, you're a rich boy. Why don't
your daddy buy you out of this?

609
00:59:22,137 --> 00:59:24,382
Believe me he did.
She ended up in the hospital.

610
00:59:24,767 --> 00:59:25,648
With her legs out.

611
00:59:26,417 --> 00:59:27,453
The hospital?

612
00:59:28,034 --> 00:59:30,980
My dad had the sex charge
expunged from the records.

613
00:59:31,681 --> 00:59:32,469
Sex?

614
00:59:33,563 --> 00:59:34,680
What happened to the girl?

615
00:59:35,975 --> 00:59:38,908
She kind of choke a little...
and passed out.

616
00:59:40,018 --> 00:59:41,835
Or did she choke on
her own vomit?

617
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:43,832
No man.

618
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:47,849
I was at this party
and I met this girl...

619
00:59:49,483 --> 00:59:52,931
We were having this...
amazing sex...

620
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:57,003
with this plastic bags over our
heads, cutting off our oxygen.

621
00:59:57,239 --> 01:00:01,762
I mean, you have to understand,
it increases the orgasm tenfold.

622
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:07,995
anyway, she started
to turn blue and...

623
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:10,059
So the real story is...

624
01:00:11,078 --> 01:00:15,092
you got an underage girl drunk and then had
sex with her while suffocating each other

625
01:00:15,614 --> 01:00:17,987
and now you're out doing
community service and she what?

626
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:19,509
In a coma?

627
01:00:19,888 --> 01:00:22,590
My old man gave her family a pile
of money for when she wakes up.

628
01:00:22,858 --> 01:00:25,104
- And you're OK with that?
- Yeah!

629
01:00:25,312 --> 01:00:28,534
and she's 15... it's not that I
care about her or anything..

630
01:00:29,896 --> 01:00:30,656
15?

631
01:00:32,717 --> 01:00:34,669
15 legal on the
line to Scab.

632
01:00:36,179 --> 01:00:38,938
I think I've heard all about
I need to in one night!

633
01:00:41,433 --> 01:00:45,185
- I'll bet your dad paid more than 5000.
- Shut up!

634
01:00:46,505 --> 01:00:48,381
It was the best
sex I've ever had.

635
01:00:54,997 --> 01:00:56,135
Oh god!
Get out of here!

636
01:00:59,008 --> 01:01:00,028
I'm not gonna die here.

637
01:01:00,792 --> 01:01:01,646
I'm not gonna die!

638
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:04,654
Get out of here!

639
01:01:07,621 --> 01:01:08,440
Get out of here!

640
01:01:08,642 --> 01:01:09,472
Get out of here!

641
01:01:09,816 --> 01:01:10,737
Get out of here!

642
01:01:12,383 --> 01:01:13,157
I'm the big dog.

643
01:01:13,642 --> 01:01:14,407
Yeah.

644
01:01:15,604 --> 01:01:17,111
See... I'm the big dog!

645
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:18,621
Yeah.

646
01:01:27,123 --> 01:01:28,953
Mother!

647
01:01:34,304 --> 01:01:35,946
Those showers were disgusting.

648
01:01:37,814 --> 01:01:38,936
They smelled funny.

649
01:01:41,377 --> 01:01:42,855
You guys are so spoiled.

650
01:01:45,756 --> 01:01:48,228
You had a long day today
didn't you Mr. Vupi.

651
01:01:49,792 --> 01:01:52,229
Is that the only Mr. Vupi
you'll ever had in your bed?

652
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:58,441
Don't listen to her Mr. Vupi.
I swear you're the only Mr. Vupi I ever had!

653
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:04,470
What do you think Scab did, to get here?

654
01:02:09,913 --> 01:02:11,966
You know that guy with the
beard who droved us here?

655
01:02:13,427 --> 01:02:14,507
He's weird man.

656
01:02:15,461 --> 01:02:16,685
Look like my Uncle Bud.

657
01:02:17,193 --> 01:02:18,598
Hey, what the hell was on his shirt?

658
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:20,632
Spew.

659
01:02:23,015 --> 01:02:23,897
Spew?

660
01:02:24,677 --> 01:02:26,168
I've seen it a million times.

661
01:02:26,529 --> 01:02:27,511
Spew.

662
01:02:33,577 --> 01:02:35,607
Where you think Ty and
that Kiki chick are at?

663
01:02:36,956 --> 01:02:37,841
Like you care!

664
01:02:38,747 --> 01:02:39,790
Asian chicks are cool.

665
01:02:41,806 --> 01:02:44,908
Remember, Ranger Bob
said if they don't show by

666
01:02:45,431 --> 01:02:47,222
noon tomorrow, he's
going looking for them.

667
01:02:48,398 --> 01:02:50,299
Well good, maybe
he'll get lost too.

668
01:02:53,063 --> 01:02:55,651
- What the hell is that?...
- Is that your pajama?

669
01:02:58,820 --> 01:02:59,980
Is that a bear costume?

670
01:03:01,642 --> 01:03:02,480
Yeah.

671
01:03:02,897 --> 01:03:04,382
Grizzly Park.

672
01:03:04,666 --> 01:03:06,904
It that what you've been dragging
up the mountain, this whole time?

673
01:03:07,103 --> 01:03:10,101
My uncle own a costume shop in L.A.
I borrowed it.

674
01:03:11,589 --> 01:03:17,186
He get alot of cool stuff, he rent to
movies, like fake police cars, ambulances

675
01:03:17,608 --> 01:03:18,517
A costume shop?

676
01:03:19,806 --> 01:03:24,268
Do you think he can get me
a police car and uniform?

677
01:03:25,924 --> 01:03:26,991
That's a bad idea man.

678
01:03:27,947 --> 01:03:29,203
That's how I ended up here.

679
01:03:29,870 --> 01:03:30,919
What are you doing with that thing?

680
01:03:31,503 --> 01:03:33,343
Go make some bear tracks.

681
01:03:34,256 --> 01:03:35,780
Try to confuse our Ranger Bob.

682
01:03:37,051 --> 01:03:42,297
Who know, maybe, tomorrow night, the
girls will scared and want to be our cabin.

683
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:44,623
I'm starting to like you Trickster.

684
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:46,744
What?

685
01:03:47,634 --> 01:03:48,682
I don't get it.

686
01:03:50,611 --> 01:03:52,916
Being in our cabins.
Sleep in our beds

687
01:03:53,325 --> 01:03:54,209
Chicks man.

688
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:56,361
Mmm... Candy.

689
01:03:57,144 --> 01:03:58,961
You'll think Lola would come?

690
01:04:00,821 --> 01:04:01,564
Why'd you care?

691
01:04:02,704 --> 01:04:03,763
I don't care.

692
01:04:05,112 --> 01:04:06,652
I was just...

693
01:04:06,687 --> 01:04:08,976
I thought you only
like white people?

694
01:04:10,581 --> 01:04:11,543
I do!

695
01:04:12,052 --> 01:04:13,225
I only like white people!

696
01:04:13,919 --> 01:04:14,892
OK?

697
01:04:15,765 --> 01:04:16,623
I was just saying!

698
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:42,764
Mike.

699
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:44,369
This is Ranger Bob.

700
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,319
Mike, do you copy?

701
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:50,694
Jerry, do you copy?

702
01:05:36,842 --> 01:05:37,605
Today!

703
01:05:53,415 --> 01:05:55,729
Let us go back to bed
if they're not coming.

704
01:05:56,196 --> 01:05:57,168
I'll get Bebe.

705
01:05:58,065 --> 01:05:59,783
No. You go get Scab.

706
01:06:00,296 --> 01:06:02,645
The rest of you, start breakfast.

707
01:06:02,803 --> 01:06:05,762
Surely one of you can
make scrabble eggs?

708
01:06:07,237 --> 01:06:09,335
Usually don't even
go to bed till now.

709
01:06:19,068 --> 01:06:21,537
Up and at them!
Hit the deck. Let's roll!

710
01:06:23,961 --> 01:06:25,088
Bebe!

711
01:06:28,887 --> 01:06:31,033
You need to wake up!

712
01:06:36,188 --> 01:06:37,121
Ranger Bob!

713
01:06:37,931 --> 01:06:40,869
Your late! You suppose to
be on your feet at 0700!

714
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,694
I'm sorry, Ranger Bob.

715
01:06:44,317 --> 01:06:46,474
You do it again I'm gonna
have to write you up!

716
01:06:49,153 --> 01:06:50,808
How late am I
allowed to be?

717
01:07:01,991 --> 01:07:03,318
Bebe now!

718
01:07:07,264 --> 01:07:11,126
A total of 18 trails have to
cleaned by the end of the week.

719
01:07:11,612 --> 01:07:13,877
Now, I'm gonna go
look for Ty and Kiki.

720
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:17,827
OK, you can make yourself some food, if you
want but be sure to clean up afterwards.

721
01:07:17,861 --> 01:07:20,056
I'll be back as soon as I can.

722
01:07:20,254 --> 01:07:23,789
We need some firewood, if you work your
way along the trail, you'll find plenty.

723
01:07:23,821 --> 01:07:25,835
Be sure to pick up trash as you go.

724
01:07:26,044 --> 01:07:30,827
and somebody let Scab know
not to wander off on his own!

725
01:07:31,036 --> 01:07:33,247
We always travel in pairs!

726
01:07:34,149 --> 01:07:35,351
Trickster.

727
01:07:35,815 --> 01:07:38,794
You and Bebe can just continue
to clean up, around here.

728
01:07:43,204 --> 01:07:44,067
Bebe...

729
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,881
It's an oil tank.

730
01:07:50,486 --> 01:07:54,106
Wow, isn't that amazing?

731
01:07:55,187 --> 01:07:57,357
They knew exactly
where to drill for oil.

732
01:07:57,521 --> 01:07:58,728
Even up here!

733
01:08:02,313 --> 01:08:03,709
Keep an eye on her.

734
01:08:04,285 --> 01:08:05,336
No problem.

735
01:08:07,151 --> 01:08:08,713
Just your eyes!

736
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:04,886
You sound like money,
Ryan Forbes III.

737
01:09:06,011 --> 01:09:08,047
So just how much money
does your daddy have?

738
01:09:13,445 --> 01:09:15,458
I see somebody
picking up trash.

739
01:09:22,993 --> 01:09:25,211
- You wanna come?
- You wish!

740
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:27,886
- Where's Scab?
- That way.

741
01:10:08,229 --> 01:10:09,325
Are you drunk?

742
01:10:14,113 --> 01:10:15,288
I'm getting high.

743
01:12:06,709 --> 01:12:08,493
I wouldn't peg Ranger Bob
for a whiskey drinker

744
01:12:09,729 --> 01:12:12,183
He's gonna be mad you went into
his cabin and messed with his stuff!

745
01:12:12,616 --> 01:12:14,629
Big deal, what
he's going to do?

746
01:12:19,145 --> 01:12:22,132
Scab... Huffing gas?

747
01:12:25,327 --> 01:12:26,202
Yeah.

748
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:31,953
My best friend Randy OD on Pam.

749
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:36,906
He ODed on a girl?

750
01:12:38,126 --> 01:12:40,480
No. No.
Pam...

751
01:12:41,508 --> 01:12:43,570
It's a cooking spray.

752
01:12:44,642 --> 01:12:49,760
You take it in a paper towel a little and
you pull it out and spray it in there and...

753
01:12:53,143 --> 01:12:54,303
.. and you'll fly.

754
01:12:55,279 --> 01:12:56,753
Isn't that bad for your lungs?

755
01:12:58,494 --> 01:13:01,520
Yeah.
He's dead.

756
01:13:14,688 --> 01:13:16,020
So Bebe, What are you here?

757
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:19,325
Did you sell your
body like Candy?

758
01:13:21,214 --> 01:13:23,524
Shoplifting. But I
didn't really do it!

759
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:25,566
My friend put
it in my bag

760
01:13:25,806 --> 01:13:27,018
and I really didn't
really know.

761
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:30,587
I'm gonna go drain
the dragon.

762
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:35,158
It's not really
a real dragon.

763
01:16:00,231 --> 01:16:01,077
Trickster!

764
01:16:07,961 --> 01:16:09,347
You're a bear, man!

765
01:16:10,017 --> 01:16:11,700
You're a bear, man!

766
01:16:15,381 --> 01:16:16,530
I wanna try it on.

767
01:16:17,425 --> 01:16:18,447
Give me your head.

768
01:16:22,330 --> 01:16:23,326
Give me your head.

769
01:16:27,384 --> 01:16:28,761
Come on, give
me your head.

770
01:16:30,044 --> 01:16:31,868
Give me.
Give me.

771
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:40,709
Did you hear that?

772
01:16:49,613 --> 01:16:50,976
Oh my God!

773
01:16:54,929 --> 01:16:56,020
What happened
to the plan!

774
01:16:57,861 --> 01:17:00,804
- I'm gonna kill you.
- I thought it was a bear!

775
01:17:01,896 --> 01:17:03,742
That what he had in his
backpack the whole time.

776
01:17:03,777 --> 01:17:05,248
Brian, that wasn't
the plan!

777
01:17:07,023 --> 01:17:08,443
I'm a good bear...
Watch!

778
01:17:35,977 --> 01:17:37,547
Over here!

779
01:17:38,006 --> 01:17:38,820
Come on!

780
01:17:42,178 --> 01:17:43,551
Get the window!

781
01:17:50,495 --> 01:17:54,225
We're safe. You can't fit in there,
it's too small!

782
01:18:25,663 --> 01:18:26,541
Lola is dead...

783
01:18:31,445 --> 01:18:33,682
We're gonna get out of here.

784
01:18:34,639 --> 01:18:35,650
You think he got Scab too?

785
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:37,908
Better hope so.

786
01:18:39,068 --> 01:18:40,383
Otherwise he'll still
gonna be hungry.

787
01:18:52,528 --> 01:18:53,464
Bebe. Shut up!

788
01:19:20,164 --> 01:19:21,042
Go check it out.

789
01:19:48,146 --> 01:19:49,228
Anything?

790
01:20:16,377 --> 01:20:17,609
It looks clear...
I don't see anything.

791
01:20:18,989 --> 01:20:19,961
You're positive?

792
01:20:38,826 --> 01:20:40,189
Maybe he went after
Lola and Scab?

793
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:43,557
No! No!

794
01:20:45,483 --> 01:20:46,815
Ryan.

795
01:20:51,423 --> 01:20:53,921
No... Ryan!

796
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:58,464
Ryan!

797
01:21:00,059 --> 01:21:01,202
Hold on!

798
01:21:24,225 --> 01:21:25,370
It's eating him.

799
01:21:29,575 --> 01:21:30,791
I don't hear him anymore.

800
01:21:37,636 --> 01:21:40,650
His hands are swollen.

801
01:22:06,618 --> 01:22:08,061
No, What are you doing?

802
01:22:09,798 --> 01:22:11,450
Help me Bebe!

803
01:22:13,330 --> 01:22:15,384
No... Bebe...

804
01:22:42,354 --> 01:22:43,095
Bebe...

805
01:22:44,401 --> 01:22:45,891
Ranger Bob...

806
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:52,215
It's OK hunny.

807
01:22:55,774 --> 01:22:57,240
Are you OK?

808
01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:14,637
- I still need to go to the bathroom
- Alright...

809
01:23:15,582 --> 01:23:17,389
I'll be back in 5 minutes so
that we can head out.

810
01:24:16,411 --> 01:24:19,659
Lisa, no, no listen...
this bear is still huge!

811
01:24:20,625 --> 01:24:23,485
like a giant, and he tore
the crap out of them!

812
01:24:24,121 --> 01:24:27,035
I'm serious, there blood was everywhere!
Blood was spreading!

813
01:24:27,696 --> 01:24:29,588
This guy's head was ripped off.

814
01:24:29,623 --> 01:24:32,106
Yeah! And I mean it's like survivor right?

815
01:24:32,966 --> 01:24:37,113
I won... I won...
I'm the last person here!

816
01:24:37,590 --> 01:24:41,737
Except... Yeah...
The ranger is such a dork!

817
01:24:43,708 --> 01:24:45,948
I fooled him from
the beginning.

818
01:24:46,571 --> 01:24:48,722
I mean I could manipulated
that bear if I wanted too.

819
01:24:49,037 --> 01:24:51,240
One of the girls had a
gun in the backpack.

820
01:24:52,651 --> 01:24:53,673
Maybe I should
shoot him?

821
01:24:54,997 --> 01:24:56,532
That could be kind of cool.

822
01:24:57,766 --> 01:24:59,247
Or I could just say I
thought he was a bear.

823
01:25:02,589 --> 01:25:05,299
Yeah.
Your right.

824
01:25:07,413 --> 01:25:09,619
I need to get down to the parking
lot, to get out of here first.

825
01:25:13,058 --> 01:25:17,045
Yeah... I think I
got to go now.

826
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:19,197
But I will call
you later OK?

827
01:25:19,539 --> 01:25:20,574
OK. See you soon.

828
01:25:21,352 --> 01:25:22,422
Bye...

829
01:26:06,301 --> 01:26:10,316
Tiffany Jones here, with a breaking
news report, live from the woods.

830
01:26:10,659 --> 01:26:12,343
Butch Latham is still this at large

831
01:26:12,403 --> 01:26:16,296
in this bizarre killing spree, that
has at least 9 adults murdered.

832
01:26:16,338 --> 01:26:19,725
including one park ranger,
here at Grizzly Park.

833
01:26:20,177 --> 01:26:23,667
8 of the young adult were murdered,
while doing community service.

834
01:26:23,915 --> 01:26:27,158
None of the 8 young adult
survived the killings.

835
01:26:27,503 --> 01:26:30,118
Butch Latham has apparently
hoodwinked authorities

836
01:26:30,419 --> 01:26:32,964
into believing that these
were bear attacks.

837
01:26:33,569 --> 01:26:35,974
A bear costume
has been found.

838
01:26:39,346 --> 01:26:42,535
Don't worry about me.
I'll be back next year.

839
01:26:46,083 --> 01:26:47,520
Atta boy!

840
