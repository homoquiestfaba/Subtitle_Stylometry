We started couples counseling.

178
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:52,559
Well, you seem a lot happier.

179
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,167
[Mark]
How's your work going?

180
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,212
Let me show you my knives.

181
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,148
Uh... yeah.

182
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:20,587
- Oh yeah.
- Got a full set.

183
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:23,390
Paring, peeling,
cheese, bread,

184
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:24,958
fillet, carving, cleaver.

185
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,428
[laughing]

186
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,997
- Cuts right through the bone.
- [Mark] Yeah, wow.

187
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,832
Yeah, cool stuff.

188
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,034
I'm upgrading, though.

189
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:35,569
We know this place on Randolph,

190
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:37,538
where all the shots in
Chicago get their knives.

191
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,975
Go ahead, take it up.

192
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,182
Feel the blade.
Go ahead.

193
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:56,223
- Just side to side sharp, huh?
- [Mark] Yeah, very sharp.

194
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,026
It's the same brand
Grant Achatz uses, Global.

195
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,428
- Oh, wow, the guy from...
- Alinea, Next.

196
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:03,197
Yeah, he's a fucking legend.

197
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:06,600
Told you it's sharp.

198
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:11,638
Were you always passionate
about electricity?

199
00:11:13,374 --> 00:11:14,908
I never thought
about it that way.

200
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,945
Do you own your own
business or...?

201
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,613
Yeah, I have a small company.

202
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,949
I have a few guys who work
for me. My son helps out.

203
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:24,551
Okay,
so you're an entrepreneur.

204
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,353
Paul, here you go.

205
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:29,123
That is a Chateau
Pontet-Canet.

206
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:38,165
Hmm. It's good.

207
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,068
- It is, isn't it?
- Yeah.

208
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:44,338
Mark, Paul's an electrician.

209
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:48,142
Oh, well, yeah.
I'm... half Hispanic, so.

210
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:52,946
Oh, nice.

211
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,186
We can all use another drink.
Hmm.

212
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,312
[Mark] I have this new app
that makes for organizing

213
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:26,748
calls so much easier.

214
00:12:26,781 --> 00:12:29,049
Oh, Dave is
addicted to podcasts.

215
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:32,319
I do spend a lot of time
in the kitchen.

216
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,221
What's the one
we had on in the car?

217
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,622
- Serial?
- No.

218
00:12:35,656 --> 00:12:38,125
Oh, Serial is
fucking amazing, though.

219
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:39,526
How have you guys
not heard of that?

220
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,528
- It's almost as good as TV.
- Wow.

221
00:12:41,562 --> 00:12:43,697
I just started listening to
this new one. It is so funny.

222
00:12:43,731 --> 00:12:45,666
- Which one?
- It's these two guys,

223
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,434
and they do this social
experiment where they

224
00:12:47,468 --> 00:12:49,470
- stop masturbating for a year.
- Mark!

225
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,341
What about you, Paul?
Do you listen to a podcast?

226
00:12:55,743 --> 00:12:58,579
Yeah, no, I like to
listen to podcasts.

227
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,581
Hmm. Like what?

228
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:03,150
History mostly.
I like Hardcore History.

229
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:06,253
Oh, I've heard that was good.

230
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:10,424
And politics, I like to
listen to political podcasts.

231
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,528
- Oh, are you like...
- Oh, I almost forgot.

232
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:18,800
Paul, I hope you're hungry
because I have prepared

233
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:22,269
an exquisite meal for, well,
for everyone this evening.

234
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:25,339
Organic pork tenderloin
locally sourced

235
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,574
and responsibly raised,
of course, chartreuse

236
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:30,077
compressed peaches,
dry melted leeks,

237
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,246
chanterelle
mushrooms resting on

238
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,081
an ethereal bed of golden figs,

239
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:37,484
seared foie gras
and a lavender pork reduction

240
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:39,520
of the chef's own divining.

241
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,156
It's a meal that moves
the earth when you eat it.

242
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,126
To paraphrase Hemingway
in For Whom the Bell Tolls.

243
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:50,264
- Robert and Maria.
- Yes! He gets it!

244
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:52,566
You get it.

245
00:13:59,707 --> 00:14:01,776
Yeah, they made love
and the earth moved.

246
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:04,478
Oh, did you,
did you read that in college?

247
00:14:04,712 --> 00:14:06,513
No, just for myself.

248
00:14:06,547 --> 00:14:08,315
Have you read
anything good lately?

249
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,684
Yeah, I just finished
The Brothers Karamazov.

250
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:12,286
I love the Brothers Karamazov.

251
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,788
Russian stuff depresses me.

252
00:14:13,821 --> 00:14:15,489
Wasn't there a
show based on that?

253
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,624
I don't think so.

254
00:14:17,892 --> 00:14:19,861
No, it's a novel by Dostoevsky.

255
00:14:19,894 --> 00:14:22,129
What am I thinking of? The
Russian show you were watching?

256
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:23,530
The Americans?

257
00:14:23,564 --> 00:14:25,499
Oh my God.
The finale.

258
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:27,401
I'm sorry.

259
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:28,703
I don't like
reading subtitles.

260
00:14:28,736 --> 00:14:30,738
[Dave]
She jumps ahead of me.

261
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:33,708
- He travels for work.
- You're in logistics, right?

262
00:14:33,741 --> 00:14:35,375
That's not who I am.

263
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:38,512
Oh, what about, have you guys
seen the show Master of None.

264
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,715
- [Mark] That's the one with...
- Aziz Ansari.

265
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:42,850
- [Dave] He's great.
- God, have you seen it?

266
00:14:42,884 --> 00:14:44,518
[Beth] I've heard that
it was great. But then

267
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,186
Aziz became problematic.

268
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,789
So true. I mean,
there's so many good shows

269
00:14:47,822 --> 00:14:49,356
on TV these days.

270
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,191
- I know!
- It's like... It's...

271
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,261
[enchanting music]

272
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:59,166
[laughing]

273
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:02,669
[doorbell ringing]

274
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:04,772
Excuse me.

275
00:15:13,815 --> 00:15:16,516
- [Dave] Hey, stranger.
- Hi!

276
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,853
- [Dave] How are you?
- Good, good.

277
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:23,557
- You look great.
- Oh yeah, you too.

278
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,163
I'm actually working
on a piece about

279
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:31,632
non-traditional
roles in child rearing.

280
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:34,869
Oh, you mean like a homosexual?

281
00:15:34,902 --> 00:15:37,237
- Mark!
- What? No, I didn't...

282
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,741
That's... You know
what I meant. Right?

283
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:43,243
Well, more couples are deciding

284
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,212
to have kids
without getting married.

285
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,782
And there's an interesting
shift in gender roles as well.

286
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:49,650
Mark and I were just
talking about this for us.

287
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:51,551
Are you and Dave
planning on having kids?

288
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:54,554
No,
we don't want to have kids.

289
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:56,523
- Oh, why not?
- It's not -

290
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,291
It's not that
I don't like kids.

291
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,895
It's just to not have
all the time, you know?

292
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:03,363
To visit when you
guys have kids,

293
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:05,232
- I'll babysit.
- Dave doesn't want them either?

294
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:08,468
No, he doesn't, actually, we...

295
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,372
I don't know.
It's complicated.

296
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:14,341
Well, Mark and I
are going to have a baby.

297
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,343
Oh, are you?
That's wonderful.

298
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:17,945
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, we're going with a

299
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:19,680
sort of
non-traditional approach.

300
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:21,348
- Okay.
- Are you adopting?

301
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,617
Um... artificial
insemination, actually.

302
00:16:25,686 --> 00:16:27,789
Oh, are you...?

303
00:16:30,925 --> 00:16:32,259
Am I what?

304
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,429
- [Irene] Like...
- Barren?

305
00:16:36,764 --> 00:16:39,767
No. Oh my God, no,
everything's working fine.

306
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:41,301
We just don't
want to want to, um...

307
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,804
To conceive in violence.

308
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:45,505
Yeah, we want our
baby to be conceived

309
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:46,874
under peaceful conditions.

310
00:16:46,908 --> 00:16:48,743
To avoid the
connotation of rape.

311
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,747
- Well, it doesn't have to be...
- Even the slightest overtone.

312
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,381
It just, it creates a safer

313
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:55,917
gestation environment
for the child.

314
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,985
As long as it's consensual...

315
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,454
It's the same as you wouldn't
want to grow up in a war zone.

316
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,422
Well, we don't want our
baby to be formed in

317
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:03,825
a traumatized womb.

318
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,928
Can't you just be gentle?

319
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:09,362
- Well, there's...
- Always the...

320
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:11,498
- The connotation.
- Exactly, the connotation.

321
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:13,600
Have you read
about this somewhere?

322
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,803
- I haven't read about.
- It's new.

323
00:17:15,837 --> 00:17:18,472
So, is it going to
be your sperm?

324
00:17:19,841 --> 00:17:21,641
[Irene] Well,
I would assume it is. It is.

325
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:23,577
- Yeah.
- We're discussing it.

326
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,046
Well, it should be.

327
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,714
Maybe your article
can help us decide.

328
00:17:26,748 --> 00:17:28,548
Anyway, the bottom line...

329
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:30,550
We're having it done by
a really wonderful doctor.

330
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:31,853
- He's Chinese.
- Mark!

331
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:33,620
Cecily recommended her.

332
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:35,957
Is that
how Cecily had her baby?

333
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,491
No, this is new.

334
00:17:39,093 --> 00:17:41,896
Well, that's wonderful,
really wonderful.

335
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:49,336
- Dave?
- You have guests.

336
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:51,005
Yeah.

337
00:17:52,073 --> 00:17:53,440
Yeah,

338
00:17:59,947 --> 00:18:01,048
Hi, everyone.

339
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:03,951
Hey, everyone,
this is our friend, Annie.

340
00:18:03,985 --> 00:18:05,352
Sorry, I'm late.

341
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,688
[Mark] Nice to... Okay.

342
00:18:11,726 --> 00:18:13,895
Oh, and of course you
already know Paul.

343
00:18:13,928 --> 00:18:16,630
- Oh, hi.
- I'm a friend of Annie's.

344
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:20,500
Oh, hi.

345
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:25,907
You haven't eaten already,
have you?

346
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,508
Oh, no, no, no.
You haven't missed anything

347
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,978
except some
rousing conversation.

348
