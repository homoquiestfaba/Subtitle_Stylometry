That's 3.5 grams.
We call it an eighth.

392
00:26:54,095 --> 00:26:57,163

<i>but I'd like to think
that it was in this moment</i>

1403
01:41:08,835 --> 01:41:10,534
<i>that Daniel Middleton knew</i>

1404
01:41:10,536 --> 01:41:12,638
<i>his time in this town
had finally come to an end.</i>

1405
01:41:13,739 --> 01:41:15,842
<i>And he knew
if he loved the girl,</i>

1406
01:41:16,442 --> 01:41:18,578
<i>the best thing was
to leave her be.</i>

1407
01:41:19,978 --> 01:41:22,979
<i>Some say he ended up
in Wyoming or Nevada.</i>

1408
01:41:22,981 --> 01:41:26,116
<i>In some forgotten little town
on the edge of the desert.</i>

1409
01:41:26,118 --> 01:41:29,053
<i>Others will tell you
he's in a big city somewhere.</i>

1410
01:41:29,055 --> 01:41:31,322
<i>Lost in the crowds.</i>

1411
01:41:31,324 --> 01:41:34,460
<i>Either way,
he was never seen again.</i>

1415
01:41:52,011 --> 01:41:53,678
<i>To this day,</i>

1416
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:56,048
<i>I can't tell you why
I looked out that window.</i>

1417
01:41:56,517 --> 01:41:58,352
<i>But when I saw her
standing there,</i>

1418
01:41:58,952 --> 01:42:02,623
<i>somehow I knew neither of us
would ever be the same.</i>

1419
01:42:04,156 --> 01:42:06,760
<i>I'm the last person in town
to see her alive.</i>

1420
01:42:07,494 --> 01:42:09,730
<i>And I don't know how
I feel about that.</i>

1421
01:42:10,397 --> 01:42:11,999
<i>I really don't.</i>

1422
01:42:14,401 --> 01:42:16,103
<i>When she left town,</i>

1423
01:42:16,937 --> 01:42:20,707
<i>she killed the dreams of every
boy whoever knew who she was.</i>

1424
01:42:21,575 --> 01:42:23,210
<i>Even if they were
little dreams.</i>

1425
01:42:24,311 --> 01:42:26,613
<i>Like catching a whiff
of her perfume.</i>

1426
01:42:27,514 --> 01:42:29,583
<i>Or tasting a piece of her gum.</i>

1427
01:42:31,585 --> 01:42:37,224
<i>Or even, maybe one day, that
she would know our names.</i>

1428
01:42:41,194 --> 01:42:45,130
<i>She was last seen in a diner
outside Peoria, Illinois,</i>

1429
01:42:45,132 --> 01:42:46,734
<i>and headed west.</i>

1430
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:55,140
<i>I wonder if she
got there okay.</i>
