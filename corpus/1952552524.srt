1
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:27,969
The dreadful case of the blood crucifer...

2
00:00:28,144 --> 00:00:30,635
<i>...occurred in London in 1887...</i>

3
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:35,012
...and formed one of the most painful
and alarming episodes...

4
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:39,178
...in my long association
with Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

5
00:00:39,355 --> 00:00:44,486
Nothing could ever eclipse in my mind
the horror of those events...

6
00:00:44,661 --> 00:00:50,156
...which honesty compels me now
to add to these chronicles.

7
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:55,971
If in future years
some other eye should read this memoir...

8
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,004
...it will, I hope, become apparent...

9
00:00:58,174 --> 00:01:01,837
...why I myself consider it best
to leave unpublished...

10
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:05,811
...in the recital
of my friend's outstanding cases...

11
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:11,113
...the heart of this appalling story.

12
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,056
It began 30 years before in India...

13
00:01:21,231 --> 00:01:25,190
...during the great mutiny
at the Red Fort of Agra...

14
00:01:25,368 --> 00:01:30,101
...the besieged stronghold
of the Mogul emperors.

15
00:02:41,978 --> 00:02:45,675
Damn you, Ross, I'm talking about money.
I need 50 rupees tonight.

16
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:48,340
Whatever for? You can't go anywhere.

17
00:02:48,518 --> 00:02:50,577
Please, Ali, just 50. Be a brick.

18
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,653
Is there a race in the fort tonight?

19
00:02:52,822 --> 00:02:54,915
At midnight,
in the square of the old quarter.

20
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,457
I find it peculiar in the extreme...

21
00:02:57,627 --> 00:03:00,960
...that these Indians
can so easily arrange a horse race...

22
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,223
...in the middle of a revolutionary uprising.

23
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:06,891
There's a superb pony called Tally Dallah.
I know I can double my money.

24
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:19,576
Look, Nelly,
you can't go off duty this evening.

25
00:03:19,749 --> 00:03:23,207
You and I must watch over 25 gates
until sunrise.

26
00:03:23,386 --> 00:03:25,946
- That's it.
- Just let me slip off for an hour later.

27
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,817
My dear fellow, there's a war on.

28
00:03:27,991 --> 00:03:31,427
The rebels won't come near this fort.
Not with Wazir Khan on the hill.

29
00:03:31,594 --> 00:03:32,618
Don't be naive.

30
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,855
Wazir Khan will bolt and join the pandies
at the first opportunity.

31
00:03:36,032 --> 00:03:37,727
But he's our maharajah.
He's devoted to us.

32
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:40,126
Sir.

33
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,134
Fall in there.

34
00:03:46,276 --> 00:03:47,538
Name?

35
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,008
Small, sir. Jonathan Small.

36
00:03:50,179 --> 00:03:51,874
Everything in order, Private Small?

37
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,916
I beg your pardon.
It's my first night on the gates...

38
00:03:55,084 --> 00:03:58,520
...and I feel a bit beef-witted about it all,
if you know what I mean.

39
00:03:58,688 --> 00:04:01,589
Could you tell me which gate is this,
in case of trouble?

40
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:04,022
We're here.

41
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:06,455
The fort has 100 gates.

42
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:08,824
We've just over a hundred white men.

43
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:12,058
So it was decided
that one British soldier and two natives...

44
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:14,066
...should be posted at each gate.

45
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:17,832
If you need any help,
fire your rifle and we will come.

46
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:22,205
If any badmash comes through your gate,
shoot to kill.

47
00:04:22,378 --> 00:04:23,436
Sir.

48
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:25,672
Very well, I will inspect your men.

49
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,840
For inspection, attention.

50
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:33,255
Greetings, illustrious buckle
on the great belt of Queen Victoria.

51
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:35,118
I'm Major Alistair Ross.

52
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,417
Hello.

53
00:04:36,592 --> 00:04:38,583
Inspiration of the beef-witted.

54
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:40,820
Talk sense to the officers.
Tell him your name.

55
00:04:40,997 --> 00:04:45,866
Ah! I'm Durga Dass, loyalty boy of 41st.

56
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,765
And this is Wali Dad. He's Afghan.

57
00:04:48,938 --> 00:04:50,098
Also, he is witless.

58
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:51,740
Well... Well...

59
00:04:51,908 --> 00:04:55,400
- This man's mad.
- The man's a mute, sir, but he's all right.

60
00:04:55,578 --> 00:04:57,443
We should replace him.
He's not competent.

61
00:04:57,613 --> 00:05:02,209
No, do not take him away.
He's powerful.

62
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,613
- I can prove it.
- How?

63
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:05,617
This mutiny...

64
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:08,985
...if you know the name
of the leader of the rebels...

65
00:05:09,158 --> 00:05:10,887
...give it to Wali Dad.

66
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,086
He will dispatch a sending and kill him.

67
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:17,890
- Major, I must apologize for this...
- No, no, no. I'm intrigued.

68
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:22,100
A sending is a horrible arrangement.

69
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:26,503
A curse sent by a chamar or wizard.

70
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:29,975
It may be as insignificant
as a piece of paper...

71
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:33,343
...or as deadly as a man without a face.

72
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:34,642
A man without a face?

73
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:35,943
Leper, sir.

74
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:40,613
Chamars of the skin-hide caste
can dispatch a sending...

75
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:44,749
...which will lie on the breast
of their enemy by night and kill him...

76
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:48,125
...like a tombstone, sahib.

77
00:05:48,297 --> 00:05:50,993
Good God. It gives me the willies.

78
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,032
Wali Dad is a chamar.

79
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,594
Let him send a sending for you.

80
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,969
Perhaps it will end the mutiny.

81
00:05:59,142 --> 00:06:01,542
The god of vengeance will assist.

82
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:03,105
You filthy devil.

83
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,906
Don't bring your pagan gods into this.

84
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:11,342
- Private, I could have you shot.
- Sir, you mustn't abuse my men.

85
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:14,080
St. Claire!

86
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:17,951
I must apologize for this officer.

87
00:06:18,528 --> 00:06:20,962
You all right, Private Small?

88
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:22,894
Yes, major.

89
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:26,930
Now, we will finish our rounds
and then I shall put you on report.

90
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:28,263
Carry on.

91
00:06:28,438 --> 00:06:31,236
Come along, Nelly.
You'll miss your horse race.

92
00:06:31,407 --> 00:06:33,136
You're such an ass.

93
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:38,076
India has an uncanny way
of bringing out extremes in people.

94
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:52,826
Shh! Be still, sahib. Be still.

95
00:06:53,863 --> 00:06:56,730
So you can talk.

96
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:59,868
And you can listen, or you can die.

97
00:07:00,036 --> 00:07:01,970
Have you joined the rebels?

98
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:05,471
- I'll call for the officers.
- They will not come unless a rifle's fired.

99
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:08,940
But do not concern yourself.
The fort is safe enough.

100
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:11,012
Then what do you want?

101
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,171
I have no money.

102
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,613
I have a Waterbury watch.
You can have that.

103
00:07:15,785 --> 00:07:19,687
I have over a million pounds in jewels.
You can have that.

104
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,689
What do you ask of me?

105
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,918
I ask you to be rich.

106
00:07:25,094 --> 00:07:27,119
Listen, Wazir Khan...

107
00:07:27,296 --> 00:07:29,787
...the mascot maharajah,
has joined the rebels.

108
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:31,365
The English do not know.

109
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:35,732
He has made plans that come what might,
he will keep his fortune.

110
00:07:35,905 --> 00:07:40,274
All the most precious stones
and choicest pearls that he owns...

111
00:07:40,443 --> 00:07:42,411
...he has put into a chest.

112
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:44,478
It is worth a fortune, sahib.

113
00:07:44,647 --> 00:07:49,880
He sends it by a trusted servant
here this night to hide in the old quarter.

114
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:54,386
This servant waits not 200 yards
from where you lie, sahib Small.

115
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,320
Out there.

116
00:07:57,827 --> 00:07:59,590
- This is fantasy.
- No.

117
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,364
It is kismet.

118
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:05,899
The kismet that happens
only once in a hundred years.

119
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:09,404
And what happens
to the trusted servant?

120
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,569
Durga Dass will cut his throat.

121
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:18,408
Say now, sahib,
are you with us or forever be silent?

122
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,912
All right.

123
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,413
I'm with you.

124
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,415
Swear it.

125
00:08:25,054 --> 00:08:28,581
I swear I am with you, heart and soul.

126
00:08:34,397 --> 00:08:35,659
You see that we trust you.

127
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,560
Walk now, Durga Dass,
and bring Lal Singh to the gate.

128
00:08:39,735 --> 00:08:41,202
Come.

129
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,911
That's not Lal Singh, it's a leper.

130
00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:29,643
A man without a face.
Man without a face.

131
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:33,689
The sending.

132
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:35,687
Christ in heaven.

133
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:47,096
Christ. The officers will come.

134
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,795
Do not think. Pray. Meditate.

135
00:09:49,972 --> 00:09:52,634
It's a sending. It's upon me, Wali Dad.

136
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:55,003
I'm untouchable.

137
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,941
Listen to me. This is no curse.

138
00:09:58,114 --> 00:09:59,809
The maharajah tricked you.

139
00:09:59,982 --> 00:10:03,645
He sent a leper with the treasure because
he knew no one would touch a leper.

140
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:05,844
But I have touched the leper.

141
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:08,746
I am cursed.

142
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,049
I've lost my caste.

143
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,260
Polluted, untouchable.

144
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,296
Quickly. Take the chest outside the gate.

145
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:22,801
I'll drag him away as far as I can.
Don't speak when the officers come.

146
00:10:25,808 --> 00:10:27,298
Stop where you are!

147
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,742
Who fired that shot?

148
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:37,550
Private Small, who is this man?

149
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,211
He tried to come through the gate, sir.

150
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:44,919
God almighty, it's a leper.

151
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,197
What is he holding?

152
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:51,356
The maharajah's joined the rebels, sir.

153
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:53,729
He sent all his jewels to the fort
to hide them.

154
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,895
They're in that chest.
Crafty bugger sent a leper.

155
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,598
These two were gonna kill him
and keep the treasure.

156
00:10:59,775 --> 00:11:02,005
And what share did they offer you?

157
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:04,674
As you say, sir.

158
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:08,049
Are you prepared to spend
the next 20 years of your life...

159
00:11:08,217 --> 00:11:10,412
...on the Andaman Islands?

160
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:15,250
I understand there is going to be
a particularly nasty prison.

161
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,415
I'm prepared for anything, sir.

162
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:22,188
- There must be a million in that chest.
- More.

163
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:28,936
Perhaps there is another way
to deal with this situation.

164
00:11:29,572 --> 00:11:31,802
It must include all five of us, major.

165
00:11:32,742 --> 00:11:34,369
Of course.

166
00:11:34,543 --> 00:11:36,602
What's the matter with him?

167
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,373
Come on, man.
We're not gonna hurt you.

168
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,277
Jesus, he's killed himself.

169
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:46,251
He said there was a curse.

170
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,482
Let me have that.

171
00:11:54,397 --> 00:11:56,160
Give them the chest.

172
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:57,492
You have no choice.

173
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,367
I'll look after you. Trust me.

174
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:04,934
- They will kill us, sahib.
- No, I have a way.

175
00:12:05,107 --> 00:12:07,439
Give them the chest.

176
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,925
It's no good, is it?

177
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:28,725
You can speak.

178
00:12:28,898 --> 00:12:31,025
I speak too well.

179
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:34,694
In this India of white voices...

180
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,100
...it's best to be silent and listen.

181
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:38,763
You were very convincing.

182
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,933
Do not flatter me, sahib.

183
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,045
What's the matter, man?
We're not going to hurt you.

184
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:46,875
You mean
there's room for me in your plans?

185
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:49,017
Of course.

186
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,320
Strange.

187
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:56,680
The bloom of the peach orchard
is upon all the valley.

188
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,056
And here, it is only dust.

189
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,622
And a great stink.

190
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:05,324
Oh, come along, man.

191
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:06,729
We're in this together.

192
00:13:06,902 --> 00:13:08,392
Together?

193
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:10,869
Are my eyes clouded?

194
00:13:11,307 --> 00:13:13,172
The treasure is yours.

195
00:13:13,342 --> 00:13:14,866
But why?

196
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,636
Why?

197
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:22,446
Because white-faced pariahs
cannot be trusted with brown skin.

198
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,046
- Kill him!
- No!

199
00:13:33,762 --> 00:13:35,059
Done.

200
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,222
- What about Small?
- Yes.

201
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,162
Why share three ways?

202
00:13:39,335 --> 00:13:40,700
Christ, Ali.

203
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,997
Three deaths already.

204
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:46,505
This curse business,
do you think there's anything in it?

205
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:51,242
Will you look on your future, Nelly?

206
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,814
- Shall I open it?
- I'm afraid.

207
00:13:57,987 --> 00:13:59,386
Of what?

208
00:13:59,555 --> 00:14:01,147
It will be empty.

209
00:14:01,323 --> 00:14:05,521
Some people say
there's no romance in India.

210
00:14:07,796 --> 00:14:09,525
These people are wrong.

211
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,008
All the stars of heaven in a box.

212
00:14:21,176 --> 00:14:25,203
And it's ours, Nelly, yours and mine.

213
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,316
Put it down.

214
00:14:33,222 --> 00:14:35,782
- Where's Wali Dad?
Dead.

215
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,949
Oh, Christ.

216
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,789
Well, we couldn't let him carry
this tale to his friends.

217
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,124
You can't trust the bloody natives.

218
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,233
That's the trouble, isn't it?

219
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,625
Can I trust you?

220
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,771
Can you trust me?

221
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,472
For all that, can you trust each other?

222
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,512
Unpleasant thought, isn't it?

223
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,449
Of course, there is a way.

224
00:15:02,618 --> 00:15:04,210
What do you propose?

225
00:15:04,386 --> 00:15:06,786
A covenant. An oath.

226
00:15:06,956 --> 00:15:08,184
You mean a paper?

227
00:15:08,357 --> 00:15:12,088
A paper stating: "We, the undersigned,
have committed two murders...

228
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:14,957
...and caused a suicide
while acquiring a great fortune...

229
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,566
...but in future we will try in every way
to be kind to each other"?

230
00:15:18,734 --> 00:15:20,634
Put our names to something like that?

231
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:22,464
- I don't want your names.
- What then?

232
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:23,662
I want your blood.

233
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,364
- Our blood?
- Aye.

234
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:29,109
A blood oath, captain.

235
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:30,870
An oath sworn in your own blood...

236
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:33,674
...which you break
on the peril of your immortal soul.

237
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,249
That's sacrilegious.
You're as mad as the natives.

238
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:38,386
Will you do it?

239
00:15:38,554 --> 00:15:41,921
The guard will be coming soon.
They'll have heard the shot.

240
00:15:42,091 --> 00:15:43,251
Yes or no?

241
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:47,121
Alistair, don't do it.

242
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:49,127
Be quiet.

243
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:51,430
It's the only way.

244
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:24,764
It's perverse.

245
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:27,333
Makes me sick. It's evil.

246
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:34,870
You will find if you wanna make
any money in this world...

247
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:40,641
...it is not always wise to be disturbed
by what we call evil.

248
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,185
And you want money, Nelly.

249
00:16:48,557 --> 00:16:51,287
It's all you ever want.

250
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:58,658
Do it.

251
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:12,841
Now...

252
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:17,516
...what shall we swear?

253
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:28,753
Move on.

254
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:05,317
Are you going to kill me?

255
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:09,288
You seem to be quite capable of
accomplishing that without my assistance.

256
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:12,297
You're developing
a certain vein of pawky humor, Watson...

257
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:15,527
...against which
I must learn to guard myself.

258
00:19:15,704 --> 00:19:17,137
Sorry, I...

259
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:21,800
I was officiating at a foot race
for medical students in Pimlico.

260
00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:23,808
I quite forgot I had it in my hand.

261
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,741
The post's here.

262
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,383
You know where it goes.

263
00:19:40,462 --> 00:19:41,929
Holmes, I must speak with you.

264
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,689
I feel I can hold out no longer.

265
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:45,959
I see. You wish to try it?

266
00:19:46,134 --> 00:19:47,465
Try it, indeed.

267
00:19:47,636 --> 00:19:51,436
I have more respect for my constitution
than to place that kind of strain upon it.

268
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,097
I suppose you're right.

269
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,472
I find it, however,
so clarifying to the mind...

270
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:59,341
...that its secondary disruptive action
is of small moment.

271
00:19:59,514 --> 00:20:01,505
Is it? Count the cost?

272
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:03,275
I speak here as a medical man.

273
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:07,115
There is a pathological and morbid process
which involves tissue destruction...

274
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,952
...and will, at last,
lead to a permanent disability.

275
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,687
- Surely the price is too high.
- My mind rebels at stagnation.

276
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:18,191
I abhor the dull routine of existence.

277
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:20,301
I am frustrated, Watson.

278
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,131
- That is not the solution.
- Nonsense.

279
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,329
Give me work.

280
00:20:24,506 --> 00:20:27,634
Give me the most abstruse cryptogram,
the most intricate analysis...

281
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,243
...and I am in my own
proper atmosphere.

282
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:32,778
Then I can dispense
with artificial stimulation.

283
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:38,215
Would you think me impertinent
if I were to put your theory to the test?

284
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,110
I should be delighted.

285
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:43,156
This watch
has recently come into my possession.

286
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,954
Perhaps you'll give me your opinion
as to the character and habits...

287
00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:49,859
...of the late owner.

288
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:52,663
Well, there are hardly any data.

289
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:56,429
The watch has been recently cleaned,
which robs me of my most important facts.

290
00:20:56,605 --> 00:20:59,597
You're right, it was cleaned
before it came into my possession.

291
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:03,609
That is, however, a most lame
and impotent excuse to cover your failure.

292
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:05,906
I make no excuse.

293
00:21:06,081 --> 00:21:09,016
This is a 50-guinea watch.
Hence, it belonged to a gentleman.

294
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,744
He was, alas,
possessed of most untidy habits.

295
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,253
He was left with good prospects
but he threw away his chances.

296
00:21:15,424 --> 00:21:19,758
Lived for some time in poverty,
with occasional intervals of prosperity...

297
00:21:19,928 --> 00:21:22,897
...until finally, taking to drink, he died.

298
00:21:23,065 --> 00:21:26,193
The watch, in fact,
belonged to your elder brother.

299
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,063
This is unworthy of you, Holmes.

300
00:21:28,236 --> 00:21:31,034
You've obviously studied the history
of my unhappy brother...

301
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:35,040
...and you now pretend to deduce
these facts in some sort of fancy...

302
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,678
My dear friend, I do apologize.

303
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:41,543
I'd forgotten how personal
and painful a thing this might be to you.

304
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:45,380
Believe me, I never even knew you had
a brother until you handed me that watch.

305
00:21:45,754 --> 00:21:48,245
Then how on earth
did you get these facts?

306
00:21:48,423 --> 00:21:50,983
They're absolutely correct
in every particular.

307
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:53,923
- No, this was not guesswork.
- I never guess.

308
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:57,327
It's a shocking habit,
destructive to the logical faculty.

309
00:21:57,499 --> 00:22:00,229
I began by stating
that your brother was careless.

310
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,563
Look at the lower part of
that watch case.

311
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,205
It's cut and marked all over...

312
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:08,434
...from the habit of keeping other objects,
such as coins and keys, in the same pocket.

313
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:09,634
Now, open the case.

314
00:22:10,045 --> 00:22:12,138
In England,
when a pawnbroker takes a watch...

315
00:22:12,314 --> 00:22:16,011
...he customarily scratches the number
of the ticket in the inside of the case.

316
00:22:16,184 --> 00:22:19,176
There are no fewer than four such numbers
visible to my lens.

317
00:22:19,354 --> 00:22:22,255
Inference,
your brother was often at low water...

318
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:26,588
...but he had occasional bursts of prosperity
or he could not have redeemed his watch.

319
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,253
Now look at the back plate.

320
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,991
There are hundreds of scratches
all around the keyhole.

321
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:33,828
Marks where the key has slipped.

322
00:22:34,002 --> 00:22:36,527
You will never see a drunkard's watch
without them.

323
00:22:36,705 --> 00:22:37,763
He winds it at night...

324
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,840
...and leaves these traces
of his unsteady hand.

325
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:43,637
Lastly, you said
the watch had come into your possession.

326
00:22:43,812 --> 00:22:45,439
Meaning you did not buy it.

327
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,674
The initials H.W. on the back
suggest your family name.

328
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,317
If the watch was left to you...

329
00:22:50,485 --> 00:22:53,045
...since your father has been dead
these many years...

330
00:22:53,221 --> 00:22:56,918
...it can only be from your late brother.
Where's the mystery in all this?

331
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:00,057
Well... Oh, I apologize, Holmes.

332
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:03,527
I should've had more faith
in your marvelous faculty.

333
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:08,265
I am the slave of my faculty.

334
00:23:08,437 --> 00:23:10,200
I am a brain, Watson.

335
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:13,933
The rest of me is a mere appendix.

336
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:16,509
However, the young woman
who is about to visit us...

337
00:23:16,678 --> 00:23:18,475
...may prove interesting.

338
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,909
What?

339
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,774
How did you...?

340
00:23:30,092 --> 00:23:31,923
I beg your pardon, gentlemen.

341
00:23:32,094 --> 00:23:33,686
My name is Irene St. Claire.

342
00:23:33,862 --> 00:23:34,920
I am Sherlock Holmes.

343
00:23:35,097 --> 00:23:38,328
This is Dr. Watson.
My particular friend is well...

344
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,162
Oh, Miss St. Claire.

345
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,360
Thank you, Dr. Watson.

346
00:23:42,537 --> 00:23:45,802
Please forgive me, gentlemen.
I have been frightened out of my wits.

347
00:23:45,974 --> 00:23:48,704
Indeed, that is most gratifying...

348
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:50,037
Most interesting.

349
00:23:50,212 --> 00:23:54,842
Miss St. Claire, if you please,
take a moment or two to compose yourself.

350
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:57,416
I have read of your exploits,
Mr. Holmes.

351
00:23:57,586 --> 00:24:00,020
But I feared
you would not wish to be of service to me.

352
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:01,621
Because you have no money.

353
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,520
Miss St. Claire, I beg you,
lay everything before us.

354
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,059
As to reward,
my profession is its own reward...

355
00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:09,754
...and my expenses
are largely defrayed for the moment.

356
00:24:09,931 --> 00:24:12,331
My last client was a sort of king.

357
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:15,436
Miss St. Claire, would you like a cup of tea?
You're shivering.

358
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:16,628
Not from cold.

359
00:24:16,805 --> 00:24:18,136
What, then?

360
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,441
Fear, Dr. Watson. Terror.

361
00:24:22,744 --> 00:24:25,542
This arrived in the post
yesterday morning.

362
00:24:28,783 --> 00:24:32,776
Hm. Curious.

363
00:24:39,194 --> 00:24:41,321
Dated 1857.

364
00:24:41,496 --> 00:24:42,861
Exactly 30 years ago.

365
00:24:43,031 --> 00:24:46,057
The thing is innocent enough.
It might be the work of a child.

366
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:50,796
But when my father opened it,
he fell unconscious to the floor.

367
00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:53,065
I put him in his bed.
He would not talk about it.

368
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,607
That evening, I heard him scream.

369
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:58,775
I ran to his room
and found him cowering in the corner...

370
00:24:58,947 --> 00:25:01,814
...muttering over and over again
something about a curse.

371
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,646
It was pitiful.

372
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,484
And then I saw it.

373
00:25:09,724 --> 00:25:11,692
Please go on. What did you see?

374
00:25:14,663 --> 00:25:18,656
Hanging on the outside of the window,
a hideous shadow.

375
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:23,467
Like a large cross stretched out
over the pane.

376
00:25:23,705 --> 00:25:28,768
It was too small to be a man,
and yet I am sure that it was real.

377
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,777
Then it vanished.

378
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:36,808
Gentlemen, I am not an hysteric.

379
00:25:36,985 --> 00:25:38,612
And I am not superstitious.

380
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:41,613
I saw what I saw.

381
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:46,420
- I believe you absolutely, Miss St. Claire.
- Oh, thank heaven.

382
00:25:46,595 --> 00:25:50,588
This morning, Mr. Holmes, when I looked
in his room, my father was gone.

383
00:25:50,765 --> 00:25:52,562
Indeed?

384
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:56,329
And you have no idea
as to the significance of this paper?

385
00:25:56,504 --> 00:25:57,994
None.

386
00:25:58,373 --> 00:26:04,835
It breaks my heart to think of him alone
and terrified, wandering in the fog.

387
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:10,315
Dr. Watson, Mr. Holmes, I...

388
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,018
I hope you will not turn me away.

389
00:26:13,188 --> 00:26:16,123
My dear young woman,
why should we do that?

390
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:20,584
My father is an opium addict.

391
00:26:21,463 --> 00:26:23,124
I'm sorry to hear that.

392
00:26:23,298 --> 00:26:26,267
That is how the little money we have
has been spent.

393
00:26:26,434 --> 00:26:29,028
Dr. Watson, I love my father.

394
00:26:29,204 --> 00:26:32,901
Something happened to him long ago that
permanently affected his heart and mind.

395
00:26:33,074 --> 00:26:37,010
- And it was this that drove him to opium.
- That drove him to addiction.

396
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:41,274
You know there are places in the East End
where one may go to breathe in the poison.

397
00:26:41,449 --> 00:26:43,815
Indeed, Miss St. Claire. Limehouse.

398
00:26:43,985 --> 00:26:46,510
But how can a man without money
support such a habit?

399
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,684
There is a Major Alistair Ross
who lives at Maidenhead...

400
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,554
...in a gloomy house
called Pondicherry Lodge.

401
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:54,194
He knew my father from the army.

402
00:26:54,629 --> 00:26:58,156
Whenever we find ourselves reduced
to our last farthing, he goes to him...

403
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:00,198
...and returns with 5 or 10 pounds.

404
00:27:00,935 --> 00:27:04,564
Would you excuse me, Miss St. Claire?
I should like to examine this paper.

405
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:07,799
I keep one or two chemicals
that might throw light in its origins.

406
00:27:07,976 --> 00:27:10,206
I'll be grateful if you did.

407
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,187
Well...

408
00:27:26,928 --> 00:27:31,490
I hope your mind is more at ease now,
Miss St. Claire.

409
00:27:31,966 --> 00:27:33,593
Thank you, Dr. Watson.

410
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:38,632
Miss St. Claire, your honesty and...

411
00:27:38,807 --> 00:27:41,275
And your courage
in the face of adversities...

412
00:27:41,443 --> 00:27:45,106
...which would drive
ordinary young women mad...

413
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,248
...fill me with awe.

414
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,814
- You're extraordinary.
I do not wish to be extraordinary.

415
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,587
I wish I were a simpleton
without any care in the world.

416
00:27:57,525 --> 00:28:01,120
Forgive me. What can you think of me?

417
00:28:01,296 --> 00:28:04,265
It just occurred to me
that I have no friends, sir.

418
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:08,129
I find myself seeking help
from two perfect strangers.

419
00:28:08,303 --> 00:28:11,295
Until this moment,
I at least had my pride.

420
00:28:11,473 --> 00:28:13,464
And you have it still.

421
00:28:16,344 --> 00:28:18,403
Your eyes are kind.

422
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,275
Is that so rare?

423
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,516
Dr. Watson.

424
00:28:23,685 --> 00:28:27,849
I have seen eyes that threaten
like loaded pistols.

425
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,614
But yours...

426
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:39,362
Miss St. Claire, will you call me John...

427
00:28:39,534 --> 00:28:41,468
...and think of me as your friend?

428
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,195
Miss St. Claire.

429
00:28:44,506 --> 00:28:47,805
- Did your father serve in India?
- Yes, Mr. Holmes.

430
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,034
How did you guess that?

431
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,644
Well, you mentioned another military man,
Major Ross.

432
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,508
And this paper is Indian papyrus.

433
00:28:54,082 --> 00:28:55,845
My dear, I do not wish to alarm you...

434
00:28:56,017 --> 00:28:59,043
...but I think we should leave
for Pondicherry Lodge at once.

435
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,018
Your father may have sought out
his former comrade.

436
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:05,023
And if not,
we still may find a clue to his whereabouts.

437
00:29:05,193 --> 00:29:08,594
If we can just catch the 3:27
from Paddington...

438
00:29:08,763 --> 00:29:10,628
...we'll be in Maidenhead before dark.

439
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,199
Mr. Holmes, you take my breath away.

440
00:29:13,368 --> 00:29:14,926
It's elementary, my dear.

441
00:29:15,403 --> 00:29:17,564
But this is not.

442
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:31,509
My family seems to be in the grasp
of some inexorable evil.

443
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:35,247
I would almost believe
that we're all cursed.

444
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:38,390
Cursed?

445
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,926
That is the second time
you've used that word. Why?

446
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:43,797
Do you believe in the supernatural,
Mr. Holmes?

447
00:29:43,965 --> 00:29:45,296
I do not discount it.

448
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:48,698
When my father returned from India,
he had no money.

449
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,203
He married my mother, Alice Napier,
who had a considerable fortune.

450
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:56,400
Almost from the beginning,
he gambled heavily and invested foolishly.

451
00:29:56,578 --> 00:29:59,809
In a few short years,
our fortune was gone.

452
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:02,541
We moved to a dingy house
in Camberwell.

453
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:04,980
And last year my mother...

454
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,317
...was taken from us.

455
00:30:08,857 --> 00:30:10,757
I'm sorry to hear that.

456
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,820
May I ask how she died?

457
00:30:16,831 --> 00:30:20,426
In a railway accident near Crewe.

458
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:24,429
Miss St. Claire,
I can understand your terror.

459
00:30:24,606 --> 00:30:25,630
What do you mean?

460
00:30:25,974 --> 00:30:28,442
The markings on this paper
were made with blood.

461
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,754
Maidenhead.

462
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,726
Maidenhead station.

463
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:54,364
Maidenhead.

464
00:30:54,536 --> 00:30:57,027
Next stop...

465
00:31:09,317 --> 00:31:11,615
Pondicherry Lodge.

466
00:31:49,057 --> 00:31:50,581
Major?

467
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,424
Major sir?

468
00:32:21,823 --> 00:32:23,256
Caught!

469
00:32:23,992 --> 00:32:26,222
Now, what are you about?

470
00:32:27,061 --> 00:32:28,619
Just tidying up, I was, governor.

471
00:32:28,796 --> 00:32:31,856
You're a fox, Birdy.
You're an exceedingly cunning fox.

472
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,365
I will not be called a fox, damn you.

473
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:37,402
"I will not be called a fox, damn you, sir. "

474
00:32:38,006 --> 00:32:39,030
Sir.

475
00:32:40,675 --> 00:32:41,937
There's a lesson for you.

476
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,975
I won't endure this.

477
00:32:44,912 --> 00:32:49,246
Oh, and what will you do about it?
Run to your mother, boy? Hm?

478
00:32:50,251 --> 00:32:51,411
I'm sorry, sir.

479
00:32:51,953 --> 00:32:55,684
Yes. Yes, Birdy, my dear boy.

480
00:32:58,292 --> 00:32:59,850
Now...

481
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,662
...why'd you come in here?

482
00:33:03,164 --> 00:33:05,064
There's a peddler at the door, sir.

483
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:09,169
A peddler? Well, give him a shilling
out of your own pocket if he moves you.

484
00:33:09,337 --> 00:33:10,964
That's what these fellows come for.

485
00:33:11,139 --> 00:33:13,869
He said he had something
of value to sell.

486
00:33:15,009 --> 00:33:18,274
- Something with jewels.
- Well, bring him in. Bring him in.

487
00:33:18,446 --> 00:33:19,572
Yes, sir.

488
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,698
This way.

489
00:33:47,842 --> 00:33:50,037
- Here we are, major.
- Get out, Birdy.

490
00:33:55,683 --> 00:33:57,981
Good day to you, master.

491
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:01,044
You're a stranger about these parts.

492
00:34:01,422 --> 00:34:03,185
Aye.

493
00:34:03,691 --> 00:34:05,750
Just put ashore.

494
00:34:05,927 --> 00:34:10,057
At Gravesend, from an Indian voyage.

495
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,694
India?

496
00:34:13,534 --> 00:34:16,697
And you have something to show me,
I understand.

497
00:34:16,871 --> 00:34:19,465
Something with jewels?

498
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:23,603
A small casket.

499
00:34:23,778 --> 00:34:26,372
Well, what's this?

500
00:34:26,681 --> 00:34:28,478
It's dull workmanship.

501
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:31,709
It's not the box, it's what's inside.

502
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:39,523
- A kris.
- Aye.

503
00:34:39,694 --> 00:34:42,060
Bloody good workmanship.

504
00:34:42,563 --> 00:34:44,360
Do you have a safe to put it in?

505
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:47,797
- What's that to you?
- Nothing.

506
00:34:49,103 --> 00:34:52,004
Can't be too careful these days.

507
00:34:54,275 --> 00:34:55,606
What are you doing?

508
00:34:55,777 --> 00:34:59,269
Looking about, sir, just looking about.

509
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,047
Taking stock
of a gentleman's sitting room.

510
00:35:04,285 --> 00:35:08,449
Not much to see, is there?
In the way of display.

511
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,425
Not if you have to sit here all day
and just look about you.

512
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:19,264
How did you lose the use of your legs,
if I may be so bold to ask?

513
00:35:19,433 --> 00:35:20,923
Damn your impertinence.

514
00:35:21,335 --> 00:35:23,565
How'd you lose yours? Come to that.

515
00:35:23,738 --> 00:35:24,898
It were chewed off.

516
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,307
- By what?
- Greed.

517
00:35:27,475 --> 00:35:29,306
- Greed?
- Aye.

518
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:33,104
You know what greed is, surely.

519
00:35:33,447 --> 00:35:37,440
- I think you're mad.
- Aye, perhaps I am.

520
00:35:39,153 --> 00:35:42,384
Perhaps I came here not to sell,
but to buy.

521
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,320
Buy what?

522
00:35:44,826 --> 00:35:46,316
Your life.

523
00:35:46,494 --> 00:35:48,485
Captain St. Claire is here, sir.

524
00:35:49,096 --> 00:35:51,724
- I put him in the library.
- Clever boy.

525
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,833
You're a very clever boy.

526
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:56,231
Now then, show this man out.

527
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,635
But if you see him again,
take a club to him.

528
00:36:12,787 --> 00:36:14,448
Good day to you, master.

529
00:36:14,622 --> 00:36:16,749
Get out, get out.

530
00:36:18,793 --> 00:36:19,953
Bring Nelly to me.

531
00:36:20,494 --> 00:36:23,395
- Hurry, boy. Hurry.
- Yes, sir.

532
00:36:31,305 --> 00:36:33,933
Captain St. Claire, sir.

533
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,371
What's the matter with you?
You look terrible.

534
00:36:38,546 --> 00:36:41,037
The curse, I've seen it.

535
00:36:41,215 --> 00:36:43,206
A monstrous cross at my window.

536
00:36:43,384 --> 00:36:46,148
It's the opium, my dear.
You imagine things.

537
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,311
No, listen.

538
00:36:51,392 --> 00:36:53,257
Yes, go away.

539
00:36:57,698 --> 00:37:00,690
- Small is alive.
- What?

540
00:37:00,868 --> 00:37:03,063
His piece of the crucifer,
it arrived yesterday.

541
00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:05,501
It was posted in London.

542
00:37:05,673 --> 00:37:09,609
If Small is here,
he's not looking for you or me.

543
00:37:09,777 --> 00:37:13,804
There's something in a treasure
which fastens on a man's mind.

544
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:18,281
- Give it to him, for chrissake.
- I will never give it up.

545
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,324
It's here, isn't it?

546
00:37:25,893 --> 00:37:29,056
- In this house.
- In this room.

547
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,721
But I gave up my share.

548
00:37:31,899 --> 00:37:35,665
Yes, you took the burden of guilt
from your own conscience.

549
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:39,699
I have watched over it and kept it pure.

550
00:37:39,874 --> 00:37:42,843
Inviolate. Whole.

551
00:37:43,711 --> 00:37:46,339
But you don't spend it.
Why must you keep it?

552
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,539
It's the having.

553
00:37:48,716 --> 00:37:51,082
The possession is my strength.

554
00:37:51,252 --> 00:37:55,120
The energy of my soul,
the warmth of my blood.

555
00:37:55,289 --> 00:37:57,223
Why do you think my legs failed me?

556
00:37:58,059 --> 00:38:00,050
I no longer needed them.

557
00:38:00,227 --> 00:38:04,425
I am content to sit in this empty room
like a dragon in a cave.

558
00:38:04,598 --> 00:38:06,293
Here.

559
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:10,904
Night and day I've gazed upon it.

560
00:38:11,272 --> 00:38:15,504
My soul has drunk its radiance.

561
00:38:15,977 --> 00:38:20,744
- I don't want to see.
- You're not worthy to see.

562
00:38:20,915 --> 00:38:22,883
But see you must.

563
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,143
I beg you, put it back.

564
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:28,686
I remember your last look at it
30 years ago.

565
00:38:28,856 --> 00:38:31,791
Ever since, it's been blazing in your mind.

566
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:37,420
Gathering its splendor against the moment
when you look upon it again.

567
00:38:37,598 --> 00:38:39,793
Let it be now.

568
00:38:39,967 --> 00:38:44,028
- I won't look.
- Then shade your eyes.

569
00:38:47,475 --> 00:38:53,107
When I die,
it will be buried with me forever.

570
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,183
Will it not make a rare lamp
for a sepulcher?

571
00:38:58,352 --> 00:39:01,651
Will it not burn brightly in a tomb?

572
00:39:01,822 --> 00:39:06,987
There shall it flame for ages,
keeping bright my memory.

573
00:39:08,996 --> 00:39:13,399
The memory of a hero.

574
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,351
Get out.

575
00:39:34,522 --> 00:39:37,116
There's a Mr. Sherlock Holmes
to see you, governor.

576
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:41,421
Sherlock Holmes, that crack
who attracts attention in the newspapers?

577
00:39:41,595 --> 00:39:45,156
Major Ross, I assume,
and Captain St. Claire.

578
00:39:45,332 --> 00:39:46,356
I am Sherlock Holmes.

579
00:39:46,534 --> 00:39:49,162
Father. My dear, let me look at you.

580
00:39:49,336 --> 00:39:51,964
Sherlock Holmes, the murder fancier.

581
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,233
Whatever could have brought you
to Maidenhead, Mr. Holmes?

582
00:39:55,409 --> 00:39:59,277
Why aren't you in London,
that great cesspool of crime?

583
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:00,641
Good heavens.

584
00:40:01,715 --> 00:40:03,876
Nelly, is this your daughter?

585
00:40:04,051 --> 00:40:06,076
Yes, Major Ross. We have met before.

586
00:40:06,253 --> 00:40:08,915
Oh, but you've grown so beautiful.

587
00:40:09,356 --> 00:40:10,380
What an honor.

588
00:40:10,558 --> 00:40:15,962
There hasn't been a woman in this house
since dear Birdy's mother left my employ.

589
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:18,462
This is my manservant, Birdy Johnson.

590
00:40:18,632 --> 00:40:20,600
But I beg you
not to ask him any questions.

591
00:40:20,768 --> 00:40:23,737
His mind is in its original state
of white paper.

592
00:40:23,904 --> 00:40:28,841
Do you require anything, sir?
Chairs, for a start.

593
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:33,412
They say a house is turned upside down
when you enter it, Mr. Holmes.

594
00:40:33,581 --> 00:40:36,778
Nothing but guessing and speculating.

595
00:40:36,951 --> 00:40:39,112
Speculating and guessing.

596
00:40:39,286 --> 00:40:42,187
Spare us your irony, sir.
Your life may be in danger.

597
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,653
What do you mean by that?

598
00:40:43,824 --> 00:40:46,884
Calm yourself, Major Ross.
Take a pinch of your snuff.

599
00:40:47,228 --> 00:40:50,095
- How do you know I use snuff?
- Though you remove all traces...

600
00:40:50,264 --> 00:40:54,394
...from your face with the handkerchief you
keep up the sleeve of your dressing gown...

601
00:40:54,568 --> 00:40:57,036
...the nail of the index finger
of your right hand...

602
00:40:57,204 --> 00:41:00,230
You are right handed.
- is encrusted with a burgundy powder...

603
00:41:00,407 --> 00:41:04,036
...which, due to its unique hue,
can only be the maharani brand of snuff...

604
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,008
...created by the East India Company.

605
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,546
Come in, Mr. Johnson.

606
00:41:10,851 --> 00:41:14,412
Two inches of solid oak
is hardly conducive to eavesdropping.

607
00:41:14,588 --> 00:41:17,386
Oh, light some candles, Birdy,
for God's sake.

608
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:22,359
It's so dark in here, you can hardly see
a magnifying glass in front of your face.

609
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:25,556
You fail to amuse me.
Nor you me.

610
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,724
You say my life is in danger.

611
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:31,463
What possible reason could you have
to offer for such a monstrous assertion?

612
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:34,301
Perhaps this.

613
00:41:35,976 --> 00:41:37,773
Where did you get that?

614
00:41:37,945 --> 00:41:39,970
- You have seen it before?
- No.

615
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:41,745
I think you have.

616
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,577
Oh, God.

617
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,844
Tell me everything
you know about this paper.

618
00:41:46,487 --> 00:41:48,352
Why don't you deduce it for yourself?

619
00:41:48,822 --> 00:41:51,586
Or is it beyond you?
Have your powers failed you?

620
00:41:51,959 --> 00:41:55,190
Do not fear for me, Major Ross,
I beg you.

621
00:41:55,362 --> 00:41:57,922
Then tell me. Amuse an old man.

622
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,895
What on earth do you think it can be?

623
00:42:00,067 --> 00:42:02,900
Deduce, sir. Deduce.

624
00:42:08,175 --> 00:42:12,202
It is a crucifer,
meaning that which bears a cross.

625
00:42:12,379 --> 00:42:17,009
Among the early Christians, it signified
a secret oath never written down.

626
00:42:17,184 --> 00:42:20,381
This one is unusual
because it is drawn in blood.

627
00:42:20,821 --> 00:42:23,483
There are three sets of thumbprints,
also in blood...

628
00:42:23,657 --> 00:42:25,488
...made whilst handling the paper.

629
00:42:26,026 --> 00:42:30,395
The other side is a section of a regulation
map of a fort with many gates.

630
00:42:30,564 --> 00:42:32,555
Some 45 are shown here.

631
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,298
This is only the center.

632
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:37,828
A man of education thinks immediately
of the Red Fort of Agra.

633
00:42:38,005 --> 00:42:40,872
The only structure in the world
with a hundred gates.

634
00:42:41,275 --> 00:42:44,870
Now, it is common knowledge that you
and St. Claire served during the mutiny.

635
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,511
So here is a desperate gesture.

636
00:42:47,681 --> 00:42:51,708
An oath drawn in blood, sworn
between three men in a time of revolution.

637
00:42:52,419 --> 00:42:55,183
Now, Major Ross,
who was the third man?

638
00:42:55,623 --> 00:42:56,647
What was the oath?

639
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,917
Most important,
should that oath be broken...

640
00:42:59,093 --> 00:43:01,823
...what precisely was the curse
that would ensue?

641
00:43:02,363 --> 00:43:03,796
Really, Mr. Holmes...

642
00:43:03,964 --> 00:43:07,866
...if you'd lived a hundred years ago,
you would have been burned.

643
00:43:09,103 --> 00:43:12,561
But first, before anything,
I want to see your piece of it.

644
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,907
- My piece?
- Please do not waste my time.

645
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:32,056
Captain St. Claire, yours.

646
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:44,698
An alarming object, is it not, Watson?

647
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:45,930
My word.

648
00:43:46,106 --> 00:43:47,539
Now, gentlemen...

649
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:52,471
...I ask you again,
who was the third man?

650
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:57,476
Jonathan Small.

651
00:43:57,651 --> 00:44:00,211
What have you done,
you blithering idiot?

652
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,287
Major Ross, I beg you.

653
00:44:02,456 --> 00:44:04,083
Help us to untangle this horror.

654
00:44:04,258 --> 00:44:06,726
- Can we not all be friends?
Friends?

655
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:11,593
I learned about friends in India
from a pack of snarling dogs.

656
00:44:16,637 --> 00:44:19,470
This dog is still alive.

657
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,074
Small. It's Jonathan Small.

658
00:44:22,676 --> 00:44:24,610
Not dead yet?

659
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,981
Watson, lock that window
and follow me.

660
00:44:31,819 --> 00:44:34,344
Johnson, don't let anyone in
or out of this room.

661
00:44:34,521 --> 00:44:36,182
Quick, Watson, after him.

662
00:44:37,825 --> 00:44:40,293
- Will you be all right?
- Yes, I'm not afraid.

663
00:44:40,461 --> 00:44:42,656
Watson. Hurry, man.

664
00:44:43,964 --> 00:44:46,990
I'm coming. Coming!

665
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:59,573
Watson, I fear we've been tricked.

666
00:45:06,053 --> 00:45:09,887
Irene?
- I'm here, father.

667
00:45:10,057 --> 00:45:13,220
Light some candles, Birdy,
for God's sake.

668
00:45:15,062 --> 00:45:16,825
Oh, God.

669
00:45:18,699 --> 00:45:20,929
The sending. The curse. It's...

670
00:45:26,006 --> 00:45:28,566
Who's there? Birdy?

671
00:45:28,742 --> 00:45:30,369
Oh, God help us.

672
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,672
Nelly.

673
00:45:35,883 --> 00:45:38,283
Damn you traitorous people.

674
00:45:38,452 --> 00:45:40,283
Birdy, where are you?

675
00:45:40,687 --> 00:45:41,915
Who's there?

676
00:45:42,089 --> 00:45:43,317
Nelly! Damn it.

677
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,321
Who's...? Who's there?

678
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,517
Birdy, where are you?

679
00:45:48,262 --> 00:45:52,096
He's been watching all the time.
He knows where it is.

680
00:45:52,566 --> 00:45:55,865
You cannot have it. It is mine.

681
00:45:56,036 --> 00:45:58,004
Mine!

682
00:45:58,205 --> 00:46:00,173
Mine!

683
00:46:21,428 --> 00:46:23,658
How much longer must we wait?

684
00:46:23,831 --> 00:46:27,460
Holmes has sent for Inspector Lestrade
of Scotland Yard.

685
00:46:27,634 --> 00:46:33,231
We must give him our evidence
as to the details of this terrible murder.

686
00:46:33,407 --> 00:46:36,570
And then we can go to London
and look for your father.

687
00:46:36,743 --> 00:46:39,576
- I hope we're not too late.
So do I.

688
00:46:40,013 --> 00:46:42,538
Inspector Lestrade,
this is my client, Miss St. Claire.

689
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,707
How do you do, miss?

690
00:46:45,085 --> 00:46:48,919
Watson.
Nasty business, this. Nasty business.

691
00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:52,786
We'll get the investigation out of the way
as soon as possible. Don't you worry.

692
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,556
- So you can leave this dreary place.
- Whatever I can do, inspector.

693
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:58,959
Cor blimey.

694
00:46:59,132 --> 00:47:01,430
Spare your comments, Hopkins.

695
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:05,394
Right, so this is Major Alistair Ross.

696
00:47:06,807 --> 00:47:10,334
I hope you haven't moved anything,
Holmes.

697
00:47:12,613 --> 00:47:14,513
I don't think it wise for you to go home.

698
00:47:14,681 --> 00:47:17,775
I suggest you come back with us
to Baker Street for tonight.

699
00:47:17,951 --> 00:47:19,316
That's a splendid idea.

700
00:47:19,486 --> 00:47:22,387
She can have my room,
and I'll sleep in the sitting room.

701
00:47:22,556 --> 00:47:25,992
I don't want to cause you any bother.
I just want to find my father.

702
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,256
Now, do you have any idea
where your father's gone?

703
00:47:29,663 --> 00:47:31,153
Yes.

704
00:47:31,398 --> 00:47:33,559
I fear he's gone to Limehouse.

705
00:47:33,734 --> 00:47:34,962
To an opium den.

706
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:37,769
My work has taken me
to such places before...

707
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:42,034
...and I have one or two favors
owed me there.

708
00:47:42,209 --> 00:47:43,938
I've examined the room and the body.

709
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:48,741
And from what you said before about what
happened when the phantom appeared...

710
00:47:48,916 --> 00:47:51,077
...I would say it's all very simple.

711
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:52,616
Really?

712
00:47:52,819 --> 00:47:57,654
Yes, all this talk of revenge
and curses has put you all on edge.

713
00:47:57,824 --> 00:48:00,520
When Small appeared at the window,
it frightened everybody.

714
00:48:00,694 --> 00:48:03,254
The room being darkened
frightened everybody some more.

715
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:08,732
The lightning threw the shadow
of that pollard lime tree into the room.

716
00:48:08,902 --> 00:48:11,336
That's your evil spirit.

717
00:48:11,505 --> 00:48:16,033
Now, this man Ross was ill.
Very ill, judging from his wheelchair.

718
00:48:16,209 --> 00:48:22,205
There are no marks on the body,
so obviously he died of a heart seizure.

719
00:48:23,183 --> 00:48:27,142
I'm afraid you've all been the victims
of a common hallucination...

720
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,755
...brought on by a pollard lime tree.

721
00:48:31,692 --> 00:48:33,819
- Let me congratulate you.
Thank you.

722
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,588
You've managed
to miss every detail of importance.

723
00:48:36,763 --> 00:48:39,061
- I beg your pardon?
- Beginning with the victim.

724
00:48:39,433 --> 00:48:44,564
You failed to notice the two very small
punctures on either side of the neck.

725
00:48:44,738 --> 00:48:47,332
I did notice.
He was obviously a careless shaver.

726
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:50,839
Fancy. Is this his razor?

727
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,172
What's that? Looks like a thorn.

728
00:48:53,981 --> 00:48:55,744
It is a thorn.

729
00:48:55,916 --> 00:48:57,406
Poisoned beyond question.

730
00:48:57,584 --> 00:48:59,017
- Poisoned?
Precisely.

731
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,881
Yeah, but what does it mean?

732
00:49:01,088 --> 00:49:03,648
It means murder, Lestrade.
What do you think it means?

733
00:49:03,824 --> 00:49:07,316
Watson, just push your hand here
in this poor fellow's arm.

734
00:49:07,494 --> 00:49:09,189
What do you feel?

735
00:49:11,164 --> 00:49:14,998
The muscles are as hard as a board.
Extreme contraction.

736
00:49:15,168 --> 00:49:17,466
- Far more than the usual rigor mortis.
- Quite so.

737
00:49:17,638 --> 00:49:21,574
Now, coupled with this distortion
of the face, what does that suggest to you?

738
00:49:21,742 --> 00:49:24,802
Death from
some powerful vegetable alkaloid.

739
00:49:24,978 --> 00:49:29,108
Some substance like strychnine,
which would produce tetanus.

740
00:49:29,282 --> 00:49:32,149
Excellent, Watson.
You really are invaluable.

741
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:35,482
Now, examine this thorn.

742
00:49:35,656 --> 00:49:37,521
Hopkins.

743
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:40,089
Is that an English thorn?

744
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:43,354
- I'm not an expert on thorns, Holmes.
- Quite right.

745
00:49:44,431 --> 00:49:47,730
Now, a few moments
after Small appeared at this window...

746
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:50,870
...Watson and I saw him escape
in the cab that brought us here.

747
00:49:51,038 --> 00:49:53,632
...at what must've been
the exact moment of the murder.

748
00:49:53,807 --> 00:49:55,604
Must have been somebody else involved.

749
00:49:55,776 --> 00:49:58,540
- A very abled and efficient ally.
- Go on.

750
00:49:58,712 --> 00:50:00,907
To begin with,
how came he into the room?

751
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:04,107
Johnson was guarding the door,
this window was locked.

752
00:50:04,284 --> 00:50:06,149
Yes, I locked it myself.

753
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,053
Did you?

754
00:50:08,622 --> 00:50:09,748
- Yes.
But even open...

755
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:12,289
...the window is too small
for a man to come through.

756
00:50:12,459 --> 00:50:15,189
Thank you, Miss St. Claire.
Now, look here.

757
00:50:15,362 --> 00:50:17,557
The muddy prints of naked feet.

758
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:21,928
Clear, well-defined, perfectly formed.

759
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:25,970
Yet scarce half the size
of those of an ordinary man.

760
00:50:27,641 --> 00:50:29,404
Good God, Holmes.

761
00:50:29,576 --> 00:50:32,306
Do you mean to say
a child has done this dreadful thing?

762
00:50:32,713 --> 00:50:33,873
Oh, my dear Lestrade.

763
00:50:34,047 --> 00:50:38,381
With all these data, you should be able
to draw some just inference.

764
00:50:38,552 --> 00:50:41,578
Diminutive footmarks. Naked feet.

765
00:50:41,755 --> 00:50:44,656
Great agility, poisoned darts.

766
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,620
- A savage.
- Superb, Watson.

767
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:52,993
An Indian who was associated
with Small during the mutiny.

768
00:50:53,166 --> 00:50:55,532
A savage certainly,
but not, I think, an Indian.

769
00:50:55,702 --> 00:50:58,466
These darts, too,
could only be shot in one way.

770
00:50:58,638 --> 00:50:59,798
Through a blowpipe.

771
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:03,136
Now then, Lestrade.
Where do we find our savage?

772
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,868
How the hell should I know?

773
00:51:05,045 --> 00:51:09,243
The Andaman Islands, 440 miles
west of Rangoon in the Bay of Bengal.

774
00:51:09,716 --> 00:51:11,741
The aborigines of the Andaman Islands...

775
00:51:11,918 --> 00:51:14,079
...are among the smallest races
on this earth.

776
00:51:14,254 --> 00:51:18,020
The Andaman Islands are also
the largest British prison in India.

777
00:51:18,191 --> 00:51:20,887
Small has obviously been there
since the mutiny.

778
00:51:21,061 --> 00:51:23,996
He must've been befriended
by one of the pygmy islanders...

779
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:26,792
...who helped him to escape
from that hell hole.

780
00:51:26,967 --> 00:51:28,798
Why, it's remarkable.

781
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:30,664
It's elementary.

782
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:33,829
What we are concerned with here
is motive.

783
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:37,738
Our pygmy was carrying something
rather heavy when he left this room.

784
00:51:37,911 --> 00:51:41,745
There are footprints in the garden up
to the window at about half an inch deep.

785
00:51:41,915 --> 00:51:44,179
Those going away are fully an inch.

786
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:47,684
And this chair
has a hidden compartment.

787
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:50,379
- Good grief.
- Now empty.

788
00:51:50,557 --> 00:51:53,720
These things would be apparent to you
if you would use your eyes.

789
00:51:53,894 --> 00:51:55,725
I was gonna look at that chair.

790
00:51:57,397 --> 00:52:00,298
- What do you make of it?
- I don't know what I make of it.

791
00:52:00,467 --> 00:52:03,766
That is because you failed to grasp
the most apparent clue.

792
00:52:03,937 --> 00:52:05,370
The crucifer.

793
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:08,064
Two officers
in command of a fort in India...

794
00:52:08,241 --> 00:52:13,144
...swear a sacred and secret oath
drawn in blood with this man Small.

795
00:52:13,313 --> 00:52:16,009
Size and weight
of what could be concealed in this chair...

796
00:52:16,183 --> 00:52:19,619
...would lead one to conclude
that they had stolen an invaluable treasure.

797
00:52:19,786 --> 00:52:23,483
Small helps them to secure the treasure
and they betray him.

798
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:25,890
But this is mere theory.

799
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:28,926
It is the only hypothesis
which covers the facts.

800
00:52:29,095 --> 00:52:30,960
But the case is not complete.

801
00:52:31,131 --> 00:52:34,897
This murder could not have been committed
without help from inside the house.

802
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:38,902
There are two punctures on Ross' neck
but only one dart.

803
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:43,099
Someone inside this house unlocked
that window and retrieved the dart.

804
00:52:43,276 --> 00:52:45,301
I have it. I have it.

805
00:52:45,478 --> 00:52:48,675
The manservant, Johnson.
There's no one else.

806
00:52:48,849 --> 00:52:51,374
You mean the butler did it?
Really, Lestrade.

807
00:52:51,551 --> 00:52:53,951
- Or her father.
- Oh, God.

808
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:58,454
There's no reason why St. Claire and Small
shouldn't form themselves into an alliance...

809
00:52:58,625 --> 00:53:01,958
...to revenge themselves on Ross
and recover the treasure.

810
00:53:02,128 --> 00:53:05,620
If that were true, I never would allow
the treasure to remain in our family.

811
00:53:05,799 --> 00:53:09,326
- After the havoc it has caused.
- I'm happy to hear you say that.

812
00:53:09,502 --> 00:53:11,595
- The treasure belongs to the crown.
Yes.

813
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,033
But where is it?

814
00:53:13,206 --> 00:53:15,504
- Small has it.
I would like to see it.

815
00:53:15,675 --> 00:53:19,133
I'd like to look on that thing
that ruined the lives of everyone around me.

816
00:53:19,312 --> 00:53:21,280
I assure you, once we've recovered it...

817
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,780
...you shall gaze upon it
to your heart's content.

818
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,850
I am very worried for my father.

819
00:53:26,019 --> 00:53:27,919
Then let's leave for Baker Street
at once.

820
00:53:28,088 --> 00:53:29,953
Come along, Lestrade.
We have work to do.

821
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:32,182
I must know what happened
that night at Agra.

822
00:53:32,359 --> 00:53:35,658
What was the curse?
Why was the crucifer left on Ross' body?

823
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:39,822
What I should like to know
is whether or not Watson locks the window.

824
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,562
You will agree your whole guess about
an accomplice rather rests on that point.

825
00:53:44,738 --> 00:53:47,571
I never guess.
Dr. Watson's a sterling fellow.

826
00:53:47,741 --> 00:53:49,834
If he says he locked the window,
he locked it.

827
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:53,468
He is not a mental deficient like
some members of the Metropolitan Police.

828
00:53:56,349 --> 00:53:58,010
Hopkins.

829
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,848
Oh. Miss St. Claire...

830
00:54:03,189 --> 00:54:04,884
...would you stay a moment, please?

831
00:54:05,058 --> 00:54:07,026
What is it, Dr. Watson?

832
00:54:08,862 --> 00:54:11,126
I... I wish you'd call me John.

833
00:54:11,298 --> 00:54:12,731
Yes, John.

834
00:54:12,899 --> 00:54:15,424
Just that don't concern yourself
about the future.

835
00:54:15,602 --> 00:54:17,467
I hope you'll let me help you.

836
00:54:17,637 --> 00:54:20,936
I should be proud
to be responsible for you.

837
00:54:21,875 --> 00:54:23,342
I mean...

838
00:54:24,444 --> 00:54:26,742
I know I'm an old campaigner.

839
00:54:28,381 --> 00:54:30,747
God, I don't know what I'm saying, I...

840
00:54:31,818 --> 00:54:33,649
I'm all feelings.

841
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,583
How kind you are.

842
00:54:36,556 --> 00:54:37,989
It's just that...

843
00:54:38,158 --> 00:54:39,625
I mean...

844
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,228
- I...
- Oh, John.

845
00:54:42,395 --> 00:54:44,329
It's been an amazing day. We've...

846
00:54:44,497 --> 00:54:48,194
We've been hurled into each other's lives
with the force of a hurricane.

847
00:54:48,668 --> 00:54:51,694
I don't understand
any of the things I feel.

848
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:56,205
I owe you and Mr. Holmes my sanity,
possibly my life.

849
00:54:56,943 --> 00:54:59,878
You're a man of such delicacy, I'm...

850
00:55:00,146 --> 00:55:02,637
I'm sure you understand.

851
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:06,878
Watson, what are you about?

852
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:08,077
Well, yes.

853
00:55:08,254 --> 00:55:11,087
Yes, well, of course I do,
I quite understand.

854
00:55:11,257 --> 00:55:13,350
Come, let us go at...

855
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:14,955
What is it?

856
00:55:15,128 --> 00:55:16,561
It's the crucifer. I...

857
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,528
Holmes said
it was the most important clue, I...

858
00:55:19,866 --> 00:55:22,334
- I wonder if I should take it with us.
- No.

859
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,431
Leave it.

860
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,866
That is where it belongs.

861
00:55:28,108 --> 00:55:29,132
Yes.

862
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,243
Where am I?

863
00:57:17,784 --> 00:57:21,686
You are in the Gate of a Hundred Sorrows,
Captain St. Claire.

864
00:57:22,589 --> 00:57:23,886
What time is it?

865
00:57:24,057 --> 00:57:27,322
To answer your question,
it is past midnight.

866
00:57:27,494 --> 00:57:31,931
To answer your need,
it is time for another pipe.

867
00:57:32,098 --> 00:57:33,565
When did I come here?

868
00:57:33,733 --> 00:57:35,758
Last evening.

869
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:40,104
It's hard to keep count
of the time in the Gate.

870
00:57:41,074 --> 00:57:43,167
Long time ago...

871
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:46,137
...I had a wife of sorts.

872
00:57:46,446 --> 00:57:48,607
But she's dead now.

873
00:57:49,249 --> 00:57:52,912
People say I killed her
by taking the black smoke.

874
00:57:53,086 --> 00:57:56,453
I murdered my wife, or so they tell me.

875
00:57:56,623 --> 00:57:58,750
My wife was a good woman.

876
00:57:58,925 --> 00:58:02,361
There was nothing good
about Madam Fung Tching.

877
00:58:02,529 --> 00:58:07,262
She was very dirty
hill-coolie woman with goiter.

878
00:58:07,433 --> 00:58:09,162
Besides perpetual good health...

879
00:58:09,335 --> 00:58:13,237
...she had discovered the secret
of perpetual bad temper.

880
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:19,242
At this time,
I own a spice shop in Calcutta.

881
00:58:20,046 --> 00:58:25,416
One night, they tell me
I filled her full of red pepper...

882
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:29,453
...and hung her from a beam
in the Babu Mosque.

883
00:58:29,622 --> 00:58:31,817
A murder in the Indian manner.

884
00:58:36,129 --> 00:58:40,259
A man needs no wife
if he is married to opium.

885
00:58:41,401 --> 00:58:42,925
Am I dead, by any chance?

886
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:45,400
Why do you speak of death?

887
00:58:45,572 --> 00:58:47,335
I came here to die.

888
00:58:47,507 --> 00:58:49,065
Why is that?

889
00:58:49,242 --> 00:58:53,110
I must join my friend, Major Ross.

890
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:55,577
He died last night.

891
00:58:56,549 --> 00:58:59,143
An angel is coming for me.

892
00:59:01,321 --> 00:59:03,846
A peg-legged angel.

893
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:09,028
Is this the angel who comes for you?

894
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,187
Father.

895
00:59:12,031 --> 00:59:13,328
How long have you been here?

896
00:59:13,499 --> 00:59:16,297
We must hang up a large black jar
outside our window...

897
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:18,164
...to ward off the evil eye.

898
00:59:18,338 --> 00:59:21,569
Yes, we'll do it now.
Let us go home to Camberwell.

899
00:59:21,741 --> 00:59:25,643
No, I can't. I started a pipe.

900
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,841
When it is finished...

901
00:59:30,416 --> 00:59:34,045
...the dragons will move about and fight.

902
00:59:34,754 --> 00:59:37,882
- What is that?
- This is my coffin.

903
00:59:38,057 --> 00:59:41,754
I brought it all the way from China
with me.

904
00:59:42,595 --> 00:59:46,554
When I die, it will go back to China...

905
00:59:46,733 --> 00:59:50,829
...with me and two ounces
of black smoke inside.

906
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:54,269
In case I should want some on the way.

907
00:59:54,774 --> 00:59:57,072
What are we to do?
- I don't know.

908
00:59:57,243 --> 01:00:00,212
Holmes said we should wait for him here.

909
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:02,845
This filthy place should be closed.

910
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,449
You should be put in prison.

911
01:00:04,617 --> 01:00:05,743
My pipe's gone out.

912
01:00:05,918 --> 01:00:07,283
I will light it.

913
01:00:07,453 --> 01:00:09,683
No, please. He's half mad already.

914
01:00:10,823 --> 01:00:12,188
For God's sake, man.

915
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:15,486
Can't you help us to get this poor fellow
out of here?

916
01:00:15,662 --> 01:00:19,621
That is the last thing I shall help you to do,
Watson.

917
01:00:20,433 --> 01:00:21,695
Very last.

918
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,893
- Holmes.
- Shh. Keep your voice down.

919
01:00:25,638 --> 01:00:27,572
How'd you come to be here?

920
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:29,731
The real Fung Tching is a friend of mine.

921
01:00:30,176 --> 01:00:33,942
Now, listen carefully. Lestrade
and his police are watching the streets.

922
01:00:34,113 --> 01:00:36,980
That sewer leads to a wharf.
There's a policeman out there.

923
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:40,244
I've had word that Jonathan Small
is checking all the opium dens.

924
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:43,321
- When he comes, I will be waiting.
- What do you want me to do?

925
01:00:43,489 --> 01:00:47,084
Take Miss St. Claire upstairs to the
slop house that fronts this sordid place.

926
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:48,352
But don't eat anything.

927
01:00:48,528 --> 01:00:51,827
Do not come back here until I send for you.
I want no distractions.

928
01:00:51,998 --> 01:00:55,229
Dr. Watson... John, please,
look at him. His breathing is so irregular.

929
01:00:56,536 --> 01:00:59,972
Have you spoken to Wali Dad
about the pony's knees?

930
01:01:00,139 --> 01:01:01,572
Now then, captain.

931
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:05,575
India's 3000 weary miles away.

932
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,440
I served there too, you know.

933
01:01:07,613 --> 01:01:10,411
That's where I got that gammy leg.

934
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:12,642
Jezail bullet.

935
01:01:13,786 --> 01:01:15,014
Is he all right, doctor?

936
01:01:15,188 --> 01:01:16,621
Oh, yes, he...

937
01:01:16,789 --> 01:01:20,748
He'll be right as rain in a few hours. Yes.

938
01:01:22,395 --> 01:01:26,354
Father, it is dangerous if you remain here.
You must come away with me now.

939
01:01:26,532 --> 01:01:27,692
Oh, no, my dear.

940
01:01:27,867 --> 01:01:30,165
I'm so afraid of dying in the open.

941
01:01:30,336 --> 01:01:31,860
Father, I beg you.

942
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:36,901
If I can attain heaven with a pipe,
why should you be envious?

943
01:01:37,076 --> 01:01:38,304
Heaven?

944
01:01:38,478 --> 01:01:40,207
That is not what I see in your face.

945
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:43,372
I see the spring of your will
unwound like a broken clock.

946
01:01:43,549 --> 01:01:46,245
I cannot bear to look at you like this.

947
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:48,613
Here. Smoke yourself to death!

948
01:01:49,522 --> 01:01:51,285
My dear, my dear.

949
01:01:52,024 --> 01:01:53,218
Are you all right?

950
01:01:53,826 --> 01:01:55,453
I've never spoken to him like that.

951
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:58,028
Now, you're completely exhausted.

952
01:01:58,197 --> 01:01:59,960
But there's no need to worry.

953
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,601
He's perfectly safe.

954
01:02:02,869 --> 01:02:05,133
Holmes is with him.

955
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,135
What do you mean?

956
01:02:07,373 --> 01:02:08,533
Come upstairs and we'll...

957
01:02:08,708 --> 01:02:11,438
We'll try and get a cup of tea
in that filthy cafe.

958
01:02:11,611 --> 01:02:13,579
I'll explain everything.

959
01:02:17,683 --> 01:02:18,741
My wife.

960
01:02:20,019 --> 01:02:23,853
She died at midnight from the heat.

961
01:02:24,023 --> 01:02:28,858
You were about
to tell me the story of that piece of paper.

962
01:02:29,028 --> 01:02:30,188
My pipe's gone out.

963
01:02:30,363 --> 01:02:33,730
Tell me the story. I will light it for you.

964
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,629
Chinaman.
- Oh, damn.

965
01:02:35,802 --> 01:02:38,600
You are well, Mr. Birdy.

966
01:02:39,906 --> 01:02:42,204
How long have I been here?

967
01:02:43,075 --> 01:02:46,044
You brought the captain here
last evening.

968
01:02:46,612 --> 01:02:49,376
Oh, Christ.

969
01:02:49,549 --> 01:02:51,574
How can I face her?

970
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,415
How can I tell her?

971
01:02:56,589 --> 01:02:59,183
I've got to get home to my mother
right away.

972
01:03:00,126 --> 01:03:01,388
What should I do?

973
01:03:01,561 --> 01:03:02,892
Hide her in the fort.

974
01:03:03,463 --> 01:03:05,454
It lies between
the coppersmith's gully...

975
01:03:05,631 --> 01:03:09,226
...and the pipe-stem seller's quarter
by the mosque of Wazir Khan.

976
01:03:10,937 --> 01:03:12,564
I have a map.

977
01:03:18,144 --> 01:03:20,169
This is the Agra Fort.

978
01:03:20,346 --> 01:03:24,373
And what happened that night
at the Agra Fort?

979
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:27,546
He cursed us.

980
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,312
What was the curse?

981
01:03:33,259 --> 01:03:36,319
He said if we betrayed him...

982
01:03:36,496 --> 01:03:38,123
Holmes.

983
01:03:38,297 --> 01:03:39,958
- Holmes.
- For the love of God.

984
01:03:41,801 --> 01:03:43,063
Holmes.

985
01:03:46,105 --> 01:03:47,436
Holmes?

986
01:03:47,607 --> 01:03:50,098
Come to the fire. Warm your hands.

987
01:03:50,276 --> 01:03:52,210
I will prepare a pipe for you.

988
01:03:52,378 --> 01:03:55,438
I don't want any of your filthy poison,
thank you.

989
01:03:55,615 --> 01:03:58,243
Where is Mr. Sherlock Holmes?

990
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:00,351
Have you drugged him?

991
01:04:01,487 --> 01:04:05,389
I warn you,
I'll close down this den of iniquity.

992
01:04:05,558 --> 01:04:09,289
You have no little vices,
Inspector Lestrade?

993
01:04:09,462 --> 01:04:13,159
For an Oriental, you are very impertinent.

994
01:04:13,332 --> 01:04:16,665
No, I have no little vices.

995
01:04:16,836 --> 01:04:20,636
One big vice in a man
leaves no room for smaller ones.

996
01:04:20,806 --> 01:04:23,036
I refer to stupidity.

997
01:04:23,209 --> 01:04:24,801
How dare you.

998
01:04:24,977 --> 01:04:26,501
For the love of God, man.

999
01:04:26,679 --> 01:04:29,580
Can't you see
I'm trying to get St. Claire to talk?

1000
01:04:29,749 --> 01:04:32,616
Holmes, you gave me quite a turn.
Was that your voice?

1001
01:04:33,052 --> 01:04:34,383
What do you want?

1002
01:04:34,887 --> 01:04:37,082
I've solved the case, Holmes.

1003
01:04:37,256 --> 01:04:39,918
I know who helped Small.

1004
01:04:40,192 --> 01:04:41,784
Look at this.

1005
01:04:42,728 --> 01:04:48,325
A signed statement
from Birdy Johnson's mother.

1006
01:04:48,501 --> 01:04:52,733
Some years ago, she robbed Ross
of some trifling silverware.

1007
01:04:52,905 --> 01:04:55,772
He forced a confession out of her,
sent it to his solicitor...

1008
01:04:55,942 --> 01:05:00,675
...with instructions to get it to the police
in case anything should happen to him.

1009
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,475
Johnson must have hated him.

1010
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:07,107
He was the one that opened the window.
He was the one that stole the thorn.

1011
01:05:07,286 --> 01:05:10,255
Johnson was Small's accomplice.

1012
01:05:10,423 --> 01:05:12,152
So the butler did do it after all.

1013
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:17,723
Oh, no, it's too late now. It is too late!

1014
01:05:17,897 --> 01:05:20,195
- It is too late!
- How long has he been there?

1015
01:05:20,366 --> 01:05:22,834
Good God, you're going to let him escape?
After him.

1016
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:29,130
Holmes. For God's sake, man.

1017
01:05:29,308 --> 01:05:32,277
Go upstairs to the cafe.
I think Irene has been poisoned.

1018
01:05:32,445 --> 01:05:34,072
How on earth...?

1019
01:05:34,246 --> 01:05:36,806
- Lestrade, why are you standing there?
- Right.

1020
01:05:36,983 --> 01:05:38,814
Watson, you stay here with St. Claire.

1021
01:05:38,985 --> 01:05:41,078
- I will see to his daughter.
- Holmes, wait, wait.

1022
01:05:41,253 --> 01:05:42,515
- Stay here.
- Wait, wait, I...

1023
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:44,212
I... Okay.

1024
01:06:06,779 --> 01:06:08,872
Hopkins, get after him, man.

1025
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:11,608
- Go on, get after him.
Okay.

1026
01:06:11,784 --> 01:06:14,651
This way! Come on.

1027
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:17,288
Get after him. Move it.

1028
01:06:17,757 --> 01:06:21,090
Alice, her mother, died violently.

1029
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:24,457
I filled her full of red pepper.

1030
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:29,060
Captain, I thought you were asleep.

1031
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:32,295
No one will light my pipe.

1032
01:06:32,705 --> 01:06:35,538
Why don't you go to sleep?

1033
01:06:35,708 --> 01:06:38,506
The moon has gone out.

1034
01:06:38,678 --> 01:06:43,377
The caravans go up
and the caravans go down.

1035
01:06:43,549 --> 01:06:48,179
And a hundred fires sparkle
in the pass.

1036
01:06:50,056 --> 01:06:52,616
Now... Now, wait...

1037
01:06:54,727 --> 01:06:57,218
Now it is quiet.

1038
01:06:58,397 --> 01:07:00,922
Now I can dream.

1039
01:07:21,353 --> 01:07:23,218
Ross.

1040
01:07:23,389 --> 01:07:26,552
Ross, is that you?

1041
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:29,852
Nelly.

1042
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:32,927
- Ross.
- Nelly.

1043
01:08:07,433 --> 01:08:09,526
Come with me.

1044
01:08:10,202 --> 01:08:11,328
Where are we going?

1045
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,233
To the entrance.

1046
01:08:13,405 --> 01:08:16,203
The entrance to the old quarter.

1047
01:08:16,375 --> 01:08:21,574
We must stop Small as he comes out
before he has time to hide the treasure.

1048
01:08:21,747 --> 01:08:26,116
Then we'll turn him in for the murder
of Wali Dad and Durga Dass.

1049
01:08:26,285 --> 01:08:29,345
He'll spend the rest of his life
on the Andaman Islands.

1050
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:32,824
Oh, no.

1051
01:08:44,236 --> 01:08:46,033
No.

1052
01:08:57,016 --> 01:08:58,643
Kill him!

1053
01:09:08,194 --> 01:09:09,923
Tell him about your leg.

1054
01:09:12,965 --> 01:09:15,957
It were torn off in a river.

1055
01:09:16,435 --> 01:09:18,596
Some water beast.

1056
01:09:18,771 --> 01:09:21,001
Shark or croc.

1057
01:09:22,107 --> 01:09:24,632
Then me eye became infected.

1058
01:09:26,378 --> 01:09:28,437
One day it just...

1059
01:09:29,648 --> 01:09:31,309
...rolled out in me hand.

1060
01:09:31,483 --> 01:09:32,609
Oh, God.

1061
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:35,679
God. God.

1062
01:09:43,195 --> 01:09:45,254
- God.
- Well, I'll leave you two alone.

1063
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:47,865
Must have so much to talk about.

1064
01:09:48,033 --> 01:09:49,330
Goodbye, Nelly.

1065
01:09:49,501 --> 01:09:51,799
Ali, wait. Don't go.

1066
01:09:51,971 --> 01:09:53,438
Please.

1067
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:55,335
Tell me, what's it like being dead?

1068
01:09:55,774 --> 01:10:00,575
You know, it's amazing to find oneself
still in the swing of things.

1069
01:10:00,746 --> 01:10:02,304
I like it.

1070
01:10:03,015 --> 01:10:04,448
Ali.

1071
01:10:23,002 --> 01:10:24,663
Jonathan Small.

1072
01:10:30,876 --> 01:10:33,845
You have broken your oath.

1073
01:10:34,013 --> 01:10:36,311
You know what must follow.

1074
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:40,312
- The curse.
- Aye.

1075
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:43,148
- The curse.
- Yes.

1076
01:10:45,824 --> 01:10:48,156
I'm glad to see you.

1077
01:10:51,196 --> 01:10:55,155
Do me the courtesy to light my pipe...

1078
01:10:55,968 --> 01:10:57,492
...and then kill me.

1079
01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:00,195
With pleasure, captain.

1080
01:11:00,372 --> 01:11:02,738
I shall lie back now...

1081
01:11:03,809 --> 01:11:08,246
...and watch the red and gold dragons
have their last big fight together.

1082
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:12,480
From the night through the day...

1083
01:11:12,651 --> 01:11:15,245
...and into the night again, I shall sleep.

1084
01:11:15,421 --> 01:11:18,219
And be the master of my dreams.

1085
01:11:18,891 --> 01:11:20,381
Come.

1086
01:11:20,559 --> 01:11:22,720
A good, stout puff.

1087
01:11:23,128 --> 01:11:27,394
Puff out the very bottom of your heart,
if any heart you have.

1088
01:11:35,641 --> 01:11:37,268
Take it.

1089
01:11:39,678 --> 01:11:43,079
Cover me. It's over.

1090
01:11:47,286 --> 01:11:49,413
God have mercy on your soul.

1091
01:11:49,588 --> 01:11:52,284
Let's go.
Hurry, man.

1092
01:11:58,430 --> 01:12:00,364
I've been outwitted, Lestrade.

1093
01:12:00,532 --> 01:12:02,090
I fear the worst.

1094
01:12:02,267 --> 01:12:03,291
Is she all right?

1095
01:12:04,069 --> 01:12:05,730
Drugged.

1096
01:12:05,904 --> 01:12:07,872
The pot of tea was still on the table.

1097
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,873
Laced with a great deal of Alwa opium.

1098
01:12:11,043 --> 01:12:13,739
She will be herself in a few hours.

1099
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:17,011
Did you catch Johnson?

1100
01:12:17,182 --> 01:12:20,117
No. No, he got away.
Fast runner, he was.

1101
01:12:20,285 --> 01:12:21,309
But not to worry.

1102
01:12:21,487 --> 01:12:23,318
- I sent my men after him.
- All your men?

1103
01:12:23,489 --> 01:12:25,957
Including the one
who was watching the wharf?

1104
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,655
Watson was here, wasn't he?

1105
01:12:29,828 --> 01:12:33,286
If you will look there, Lestrade,
you will see that Watson is unconscious.

1106
01:12:33,465 --> 01:12:36,491
Drugged, I don't doubt,
with the same pot of tea.

1107
01:12:36,668 --> 01:12:38,533
Well, no harm done.

1108
01:12:38,704 --> 01:12:40,763
I mean, everything seems to be in order.

1109
01:12:43,108 --> 01:12:45,167
Perfect order, for the killer.

1110
01:12:45,344 --> 01:12:49,075
The drugging created a splendid diversion
that gave Small time to slip in here...

1111
01:12:49,248 --> 01:12:50,408
...and murder St. Claire.

1112
01:12:50,582 --> 01:12:53,107
- St. Claire dead?
- See for yourself, is he breathing?

1113
01:12:53,285 --> 01:12:55,981
This is very awkward, Holmes,
I must say.

1114
01:12:56,155 --> 01:12:58,715
Right under our noses, as it were.

1115
01:12:59,224 --> 01:13:01,158
Oh, God.

1116
01:13:01,326 --> 01:13:04,762
- What...? What happened?
- Are you rational, man?

1117
01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:07,364
Yeah, I... Yeah, I think so.

1118
01:13:07,533 --> 01:13:09,330
My God, I... I fell asleep.

1119
01:13:09,501 --> 01:13:11,935
That lascar brute
put opium pills in your teapot.

1120
01:13:12,104 --> 01:13:13,366
Irene.

1121
01:13:13,539 --> 01:13:16,337
Unpleasant experience for a young girl
but by no means fatal.

1122
01:13:16,508 --> 01:13:17,805
Well?

1123
01:13:19,011 --> 01:13:22,139
Why, Holmes, you're wrong, I'm afraid.

1124
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:24,282
No signs of violence here.

1125
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:26,941
There are no prick marks
or anything like that.

1126
01:13:27,119 --> 01:13:28,916
This man was not murdered.

1127
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:32,751
Again.

1128
01:13:32,925 --> 01:13:33,949
What does it mean?

1129
01:13:34,126 --> 01:13:37,892
Why were these men
tyrannized by scraps of paper?

1130
01:13:38,063 --> 01:13:39,325
Holmes.

1131
01:13:39,998 --> 01:13:43,161
It's the same symptoms as Major Ross.

1132
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:45,303
And look here, blood.

1133
01:13:50,442 --> 01:13:53,434
Another thorn.

1134
01:13:53,612 --> 01:13:56,672
This one was inserted
in the stem of his pipe.

1135
01:13:57,082 --> 01:13:59,243
One good puff drew it into his mouth.

1136
01:14:00,786 --> 01:14:02,981
Watson, take Miss St. Claire
and bring her to the wharf.

1137
01:14:03,155 --> 01:14:05,316
We'll find a policeman
to take her to Baker Street.

1138
01:14:05,491 --> 01:14:08,358
- Lestrade, there's not a moment to lose.
Right.

1139
01:14:12,564 --> 01:14:15,055
Come along, man.
- Yeah, but where are we going?

1140
01:14:15,234 --> 01:14:18,032
May I remind you, Lestrade,
that Small has finished his work.

1141
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:19,295
My God, the treasure.

1142
01:14:19,471 --> 01:14:23,168
Order up your steam-launch and have them
meet us at the wharf in 15 minutes.

1143
01:14:23,342 --> 01:14:25,333
Small will almost certainly be
in a rowboat.

1144
01:14:25,511 --> 01:14:28,537
But it will still be a damn close-run thing.

1145
01:14:31,517 --> 01:14:34,008
Rest. Rest here.

1146
01:14:34,786 --> 01:14:36,447
Father.

1147
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:38,914
Father.

1148
01:14:39,091 --> 01:14:41,184
I'm... I'm here.

1149
01:14:41,627 --> 01:14:43,720
You must advise me.

1150
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:45,557
Gladly.

1151
01:14:47,533 --> 01:14:50,161
I think I have fallen in love.

1152
01:14:50,469 --> 01:14:53,563
While I've been away?

1153
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,604
Even so.

1154
01:14:56,608 --> 01:14:59,168
Plunge must have been very deep.

1155
01:14:59,545 --> 01:15:01,536
It was...

1156
01:15:01,713 --> 01:15:04,273
...as deep as a well.

1157
01:15:06,385 --> 01:15:08,216
Why do you love him?

1158
01:15:08,387 --> 01:15:13,120
Oh, he's rare and so kind.

1159
01:15:13,292 --> 01:15:16,193
Kindness, it's so old-fashioned.

1160
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:18,821
It has a habit of coming back...

1161
01:15:18,997 --> 01:15:22,558
...every now and then,
when it's least expected.

1162
01:15:24,636 --> 01:15:25,967
What...?

1163
01:15:26,438 --> 01:15:28,235
What's his name?

1164
01:15:28,807 --> 01:15:30,468
His name?

1165
01:15:31,310 --> 01:15:33,437
His name is John.

1166
01:15:38,684 --> 01:15:40,345
John.

1167
01:15:41,153 --> 01:15:43,121
Oh, my dear.

1168
01:16:04,576 --> 01:16:06,601
Got too much of
a start on us, Holmes.

1169
01:16:06,778 --> 01:16:08,370
I can't see anything in this.

1170
01:16:08,547 --> 01:16:10,742
- We'll never catch him.
- We must catch him.

1171
01:16:10,916 --> 01:16:12,349
Pour it on, stoker.

1172
01:16:12,517 --> 01:16:15,042
Even if we burn the boat,
we must have him.

1173
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:25,490
Constable, you must hold your course.
South by southeast with this current.

1174
01:16:26,031 --> 01:16:28,022
South by southeast, sir.

1175
01:16:29,768 --> 01:16:33,033
Small's best chance is to get out
of the country with the treasure.

1176
01:16:33,205 --> 01:16:35,639
If we can come up with him
before he boards his ship...

1177
01:16:35,807 --> 01:16:38,571
How can you be so certain
he's going to escape by sea?

1178
01:16:38,744 --> 01:16:41,770
Lestrade, we are an island nation.

1179
01:16:41,947 --> 01:16:45,041
But how do you know which
harbor he has gone to and which ship?

1180
01:16:45,217 --> 01:16:47,651
While the real Fung Tching
was watching St. Claire...

1181
01:16:47,819 --> 01:16:50,413
...I went to Gravesend,
our most sordid port.

1182
01:16:50,589 --> 01:16:54,116
A pound note there will buy you
all the information you could ask for.

1183
01:16:54,293 --> 01:16:58,229
People tend to remember a one-legged man
traveling with a pygmy.

1184
01:16:58,397 --> 01:17:00,058
They booked passage on a schooner...

1185
01:17:00,232 --> 01:17:03,360
<i>...called the Gloria Scott,
docked at Greenwich.</i>

1186
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:09,324
Police.

1187
01:18:09,501 --> 01:18:11,765
Stop in the name of the crown.

1188
01:18:17,676 --> 01:18:20,110
Stop in the name of the crown.

1189
01:18:22,848 --> 01:18:23,940
Keep off!

1190
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:27,210
Keep off, damn you,
until I finish me work.

1191
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:28,711
Keep away.

1192
01:18:35,327 --> 01:18:36,817
Look out.

1193
01:18:39,297 --> 01:18:40,662
No!

1194
01:18:45,070 --> 01:18:47,038
Go ahead and fire.

1195
01:18:47,205 --> 01:18:50,504
Life don't mean nothing to me.

1196
01:18:50,675 --> 01:18:54,702
Let the sea take this poison.

1197
01:19:05,290 --> 01:19:06,587
Well done.

1198
01:19:12,364 --> 01:19:15,026
- Hopkins, bring us alongside the bow.
Yes, sir.

1199
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,498
All right, come on, alongside.

1200
01:19:21,873 --> 01:19:23,465
Get a line on her.

1201
01:19:23,642 --> 01:19:25,872
Come on, move it, move it.

1202
01:19:30,348 --> 01:19:32,145
Hopkins, follow me.

1203
01:19:32,317 --> 01:19:35,115
Yes, sir. Right behind you.

1204
01:19:35,287 --> 01:19:36,879
Jonathan Small...

1205
01:19:37,055 --> 01:19:42,118
...I arrest you for the willful murder
of Alistair Ross and Neville St. Claire.

1206
01:19:42,294 --> 01:19:47,425
Aye. I reckon their deaths lie on my soul,
right enough.

1207
01:19:47,599 --> 01:19:48,623
For God's sake, man...

1208
01:19:49,568 --> 01:19:51,058
...is it drowned?

1209
01:19:51,236 --> 01:19:52,760
Is the chest in the sea?

1210
01:19:53,405 --> 01:19:55,100
Yes, it is.

1211
01:19:55,273 --> 01:19:57,935
Who are you?
- I'm Sherlock Holmes.

1212
01:19:58,109 --> 01:20:01,010
Oh, you're the clever one.

1213
01:20:01,179 --> 01:20:03,340
I knew it weren't him.

1214
01:20:03,648 --> 01:20:06,014
You led me a merry chase, Mr. Holmes.

1215
01:20:06,184 --> 01:20:09,244
May I repay the complement, Mr. Small.

1216
01:20:09,421 --> 01:20:12,117
Would you answer one or two questions?

1217
01:20:12,290 --> 01:20:13,917
Aye.

1218
01:20:14,092 --> 01:20:17,755
I should like to leave some account
of the business behind me.

1219
01:20:17,929 --> 01:20:20,727
I don't wanna be remembered
as a common cutthroat.

1220
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:22,260
Who is your accomplice?

1221
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:24,167
- Tonga.
- The pygmy.

1222
01:20:24,336 --> 01:20:25,769
Yeah.

1223
01:20:25,937 --> 01:20:28,167
He helped me escape
from the Andaman Islands.

1224
01:20:28,673 --> 01:20:31,301
He was a good and a crafty little devil.

1225
01:20:31,843 --> 01:20:35,370
I couldn't kill Ross until I knew
where the treasure was.

1226
01:20:35,547 --> 01:20:40,416
Tonga sat in the tree all day
and watched until he found out.

1227
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:44,681
Then I got you gentlemen out
of the room, and Tonga killed him.

1228
01:20:45,323 --> 01:20:47,314
But who helped you?
Who unlocked the window?

1229
01:20:47,492 --> 01:20:48,754
Who retrieved the dart?

1230
01:20:49,794 --> 01:20:51,284
No one, we had plenty.

1231
01:20:51,463 --> 01:20:55,331
You mean, there was no accomplice
inside the house?

1232
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,967
No, of course not.

1233
01:20:57,135 --> 01:20:58,295
Who opened the window?

1234
01:20:59,738 --> 01:21:01,797
I don't know what you're talking about.

1235
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:04,368
What was the curse?

1236
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:10,380
He who broke the oath
would die by the others' hand...

1237
01:21:10,549 --> 01:21:13,985
...that his piece of the oath should lie
on his own dead breast.

1238
01:21:14,152 --> 01:21:16,780
So that's why you put St. Claire's piece
on his body.

1239
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:19,982
I didn't.

1240
01:21:20,158 --> 01:21:22,592
- You didn't?
- No.

1241
01:21:22,761 --> 01:21:25,787
He just looked on and died.

1242
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:29,991
- I left the crucifer on the floor.
- You didn't kill him?

1243
01:21:30,569 --> 01:21:34,164
No. No, I swear it.

1244
01:21:34,339 --> 01:21:35,704
Good God, man.

1245
01:21:35,874 --> 01:21:37,705
What have you done?

1246
01:21:37,876 --> 01:21:41,209
He stabbed himself.
Oh, dear.

1247
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:43,238
My task is done.

1248
01:21:43,415 --> 01:21:45,815
And done well.

1249
01:21:46,351 --> 01:21:47,875
Where's my piece of the crucifer?

1250
01:21:48,053 --> 01:21:50,021
- You have it about you?
- I do.

1251
01:21:50,188 --> 01:21:51,746
Give it to me, Mr. Holmes.

1252
01:21:52,390 --> 01:21:55,291
Let me die under it as the others did.

1253
01:21:56,194 --> 01:21:58,526
A trinity of stupid men.

1254
01:21:59,531 --> 01:22:01,328
Aye.

1255
01:22:01,499 --> 01:22:04,798
The bloody sign for greed.

1256
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:13,508
God rest his soul.

1257
01:22:16,648 --> 01:22:18,081
Indeed.

1258
01:22:18,984 --> 01:22:20,508
Told me what he knew.

1259
01:22:21,386 --> 01:22:24,719
It's not enough, there's something else.

1260
01:22:25,423 --> 01:22:27,550
Something more.

1261
01:23:07,532 --> 01:23:08,965
Mr. Johnson.

1262
01:23:09,134 --> 01:23:10,465
Where is Holmes?

1263
01:23:10,635 --> 01:23:12,159
There's no one here.

1264
01:23:12,337 --> 01:23:14,134
I mean, they will be back soon.

1265
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,774
It's just as well.

1266
01:23:18,209 --> 01:23:20,507
You are the one I wanna talk to, miss.

1267
01:23:20,679 --> 01:23:22,544
Oh, yes.

1268
01:23:22,714 --> 01:23:24,375
About what?

1269
01:23:24,549 --> 01:23:26,073
I want you to help me.

1270
01:23:26,885 --> 01:23:28,716
- How?
- Not in here, miss.

1271
01:23:28,887 --> 01:23:31,583
The police may come.
They're looking for me, you know.

1272
01:23:37,128 --> 01:23:39,358
But what do you want of me?

1273
01:23:40,765 --> 01:23:44,531
Are there other rooms
where we might have a little chat?

1274
01:23:44,703 --> 01:23:46,102
Friendly-like.

1275
01:23:52,243 --> 01:23:54,143
This will do.

1276
01:24:04,923 --> 01:24:06,914
Will you excuse me a moment, gentlemen?

1277
01:24:07,092 --> 01:24:09,856
I'm just going to look in on Miss St. Claire.

1278
01:24:14,032 --> 01:24:17,433
Holmes,
you haven't said a word for over an hour.

1279
01:24:17,602 --> 01:24:21,402
We just have to catch Birdy Johnson
and the case is complete.

1280
01:24:21,573 --> 01:24:23,200
Is it?

1281
01:24:23,374 --> 01:24:26,707
It strikes me as a trifle too obvious.

1282
01:24:28,279 --> 01:24:31,339
I have formed no conclusion whatever.

1283
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:33,215
I have.

1284
01:24:33,685 --> 01:24:35,585
And it now proves correct.

1285
01:24:35,754 --> 01:24:37,415
Consider the facts, Holmes.

1286
01:24:37,589 --> 01:24:39,580
Johnson is present at both murders.

1287
01:24:39,758 --> 01:24:43,592
He holds open the window at the lodge,
thus aiding the pygmy.

1288
01:24:43,762 --> 01:24:47,528
He lures the police away
from the opium den, thus aiding Small.

1289
01:24:48,233 --> 01:24:53,193
You must concede, Holmes,
I am a little in front of you on this occasion.

1290
01:24:56,708 --> 01:24:58,039
What was that noise?

1291
01:24:58,209 --> 01:25:01,645
That was Lestrade's little cock-a-doodle
of victory.

1292
01:25:02,781 --> 01:25:04,180
How is Miss St. Claire?

1293
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:06,681
Oh, she is asleep.

1294
01:25:07,786 --> 01:25:09,720
I'm sorry, I'm awfully jumpy.

1295
01:25:09,888 --> 01:25:12,288
That poor fellow has put me
completely on edge.

1296
01:25:12,457 --> 01:25:14,118
Small? Why is that?

1297
01:25:14,292 --> 01:25:16,590
I felt he was telling the truth.

1298
01:25:16,761 --> 01:25:18,228
- Did you?
Oh, really.

1299
01:25:19,731 --> 01:25:22,700
Well, they will be waiting
for our statements at Scotland Yard.

1300
01:25:22,867 --> 01:25:25,427
Watson can stay here with the chest.

1301
01:25:25,904 --> 01:25:29,897
Well, I suppose it's safe enough
in the home of the great detective.

1302
01:26:07,512 --> 01:26:09,480
Irene.

1303
01:26:10,448 --> 01:26:13,315
You look magnificent.

1304
01:26:14,519 --> 01:26:16,510
- What on earth did you...?
- Thank you, John.

1305
01:26:16,988 --> 01:26:19,252
This gown was my mother's.

1306
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:21,858
I've been saving it
for a special occasion.

1307
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:25,991
- Special?
- It is here.

1308
01:26:27,365 --> 01:26:30,630
My dear, are you feeling quite yourself?

1309
01:26:31,035 --> 01:26:34,698
- The opium...
- I am quite myself, John.

1310
01:26:35,907 --> 01:26:36,931
Open it.

1311
01:26:37,876 --> 01:26:42,506
Irene, there is something I must tell you
about your father.

1312
01:26:44,549 --> 01:26:46,346
Open the chest first.

1313
01:26:49,721 --> 01:26:51,518
Well, why not.

1314
01:26:52,824 --> 01:26:55,156
There's been enough horror
this long night.

1315
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:09,865
Spill it out onto the floor.

1316
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:12,134
I want to see it flung about.

1317
01:27:24,923 --> 01:27:27,551
Oh, God.

1318
01:27:30,995 --> 01:27:34,590
This is a bonny thing.

1319
01:27:34,766 --> 01:27:36,028
Put it down.

1320
01:27:46,077 --> 01:27:47,374
Irene...

1321
01:27:47,545 --> 01:27:51,641
...you said you were saving the dress
for a special occasion.

1322
01:27:52,283 --> 01:27:53,409
For what occasion?

1323
01:27:54,352 --> 01:27:56,343
For a dream come true.

1324
01:27:57,822 --> 01:28:00,154
No, that's not right.

1325
01:28:00,325 --> 01:28:02,190
I must tell you.

1326
01:28:02,961 --> 01:28:05,759
My dear, your father is dead.

1327
01:28:06,664 --> 01:28:10,361
That is the special occasion.

1328
01:28:11,736 --> 01:28:14,933
No, please,
you don't know what you're saying.

1329
01:28:15,106 --> 01:28:17,904
- Perhaps you should lie down.
- Do you think I'm going mad?

1330
01:28:19,978 --> 01:28:23,345
Too many shocks for a young lady?

1331
01:28:23,514 --> 01:28:25,414
Oh, John.

1332
01:28:25,783 --> 01:28:30,550
The moment I walked through that door
and looked into your eyes...

1333
01:28:30,722 --> 01:28:32,815
...I knew I could do it.

1334
01:28:32,991 --> 01:28:34,925
Do what?

1335
01:28:35,093 --> 01:28:39,587
Persuade you and Mr. Holmes
to help me get what is rightfully mine.

1336
01:28:39,764 --> 01:28:42,198
Am I dreaming?

1337
01:28:42,367 --> 01:28:45,268
This will wake you.

1338
01:28:46,337 --> 01:28:48,066
Yes.

1339
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:51,231
I opened the window
at Pondicherry Lodge.

1340
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:53,673
I took the other thorn
out of Major Ross's neck...

1341
01:28:53,845 --> 01:28:55,676
...and put it into my father's pipe.

1342
01:28:55,847 --> 01:28:57,144
My hand was trembling...

1343
01:28:57,315 --> 01:29:00,182
...so that I thought I must surely pierce
my own skin and die.

1344
01:29:00,351 --> 01:29:03,582
But by then I knew that nothing
in the world could stop me.

1345
01:29:04,122 --> 01:29:05,248
And now...

1346
01:29:05,823 --> 01:29:07,347
...I am going to kill you...

1347
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:10,925
...and take what I have won.

1348
01:29:12,330 --> 01:29:14,628
Why, you miserable wretch.

1349
01:29:15,166 --> 01:29:17,327
You can't hope to succeed.

1350
01:29:17,502 --> 01:29:19,936
You think when Holmes comes back
and finds my body...

1351
01:29:20,104 --> 01:29:21,833
...he won't deduce what has happened?

1352
01:29:22,006 --> 01:29:23,405
I think not.

1353
01:29:23,574 --> 01:29:26,873
Birdy Johnson was kind enough
to call a little while ago.

1354
01:29:27,045 --> 01:29:28,637
I took the liberty of killing him.

1355
01:29:30,214 --> 01:29:32,239
He's under your bed.

1356
01:29:33,484 --> 01:29:36,317
When the police arrive,
this is how it will appear.

1357
01:29:36,487 --> 01:29:39,650
Johnson came here and broke
into the basement to steal the treasure.

1358
01:29:39,824 --> 01:29:41,121
There was a struggle.

1359
01:29:41,292 --> 01:29:42,816
You stabbed him, he shot you.

1360
01:29:42,994 --> 01:29:48,694
Someone heard the shot
and came to find a chest full of jewels.

1361
01:29:48,866 --> 01:29:51,596
What became of the young woman?

1362
01:29:52,036 --> 01:29:55,665
She vanished into the fog...

1363
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:59,276
...driven mad by the death
of her father...

1364
01:29:59,444 --> 01:30:02,413
...and the even more terrible death...

1365
01:30:05,183 --> 01:30:07,083
...of her lover.

1366
01:30:09,053 --> 01:30:11,044
You are a horror.

1367
01:30:11,722 --> 01:30:15,749
And you are a darling.

1368
01:30:16,861 --> 01:30:18,556
You are my biggest ally.

1369
01:30:19,230 --> 01:30:21,664
I could not have done it without you.

1370
01:30:22,867 --> 01:30:24,391
Yes.

1371
01:30:24,569 --> 01:30:26,366
You have done it.

1372
01:30:26,537 --> 01:30:30,997
And with my help, you've made me
as miserable a creature as yourself.

1373
01:30:35,179 --> 01:30:39,741
If your touch is as fatal to me
as to others...

1374
01:30:39,917 --> 01:30:44,752
...give me one last kiss
of unspeakable hatred.

1375
01:30:47,525 --> 01:30:48,685
And let me die.

1376
01:31:49,253 --> 01:31:50,311
Come in, Mr. Holmes.

1377
01:31:50,855 --> 01:31:53,016
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

1378
01:31:53,191 --> 01:31:55,250
I sent Lestrade ahead with the body.

1379
01:31:57,762 --> 01:32:00,060
- Whose body?
- Small's.

1380
01:32:00,231 --> 01:32:01,858
Small is dead?

1381
01:32:02,033 --> 01:32:06,629
Well, I must say, fate seems
to be smiling on me for a change.

1382
01:32:06,804 --> 01:32:08,965
Why did you come back? I'm curious.

1383
01:32:09,140 --> 01:32:10,402
My dagger.

1384
01:32:10,575 --> 01:32:12,543
You moved my dagger from the mantle.

1385
01:32:12,710 --> 01:32:14,473
I needed it.

1386
01:32:14,645 --> 01:32:17,546
Johnson saw me open the window
at Pondicherry Lodge.

1387
01:32:17,715 --> 01:32:21,947
So you've killed poor Johnson
and Watson as well.

1388
01:32:23,187 --> 01:32:25,155
You do not seem very concerned.

1389
01:32:25,323 --> 01:32:30,283
I am too awed by you.
I can think of nothing else.

1390
01:32:30,461 --> 01:32:33,897
I thought you were omniscient,
Mr. Holmes.

1391
01:32:34,365 --> 01:32:35,923
But tell me...

1392
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:39,433
...surely my moving the dagger was not
the only thing that gave me away.

1393
01:32:39,604 --> 01:32:42,971
No, no, that was merely the catalyst.

1394
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:45,199
When you have eliminated
the impossible...

1395
01:32:45,376 --> 01:32:48,243
...whatever remains, however improbable,
must be the truth.

1396
01:32:48,412 --> 01:32:50,846
There were others in the room
when Ross was murdered.

1397
01:32:51,015 --> 01:32:53,882
But you were the only one
who could have killed your father...

1398
01:32:54,051 --> 01:32:56,542
...if Small was telling the truth.

1399
01:32:56,721 --> 01:32:59,519
I put that thorn in Father's pipe
right under your nose.

1400
01:32:59,957 --> 01:33:04,189
But you were too busy showing off
your Chinese costume to Watson.

1401
01:33:05,563 --> 01:33:06,825
What was my mistake?

1402
01:33:07,298 --> 01:33:08,458
The crucifer.

1403
01:33:08,633 --> 01:33:10,897
You should not have put it
in your father's body.

1404
01:33:11,068 --> 01:33:12,899
Small felt responsible for his death...

1405
01:33:13,070 --> 01:33:15,698
...but he swore he did not put
the paper on his chest.

1406
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:19,432
Well, no one is perfect.

1407
01:33:19,610 --> 01:33:20,872
You came close.

1408
01:33:21,345 --> 01:33:23,677
Why did you come to me
in the first place?

1409
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:28,182
When the crucifer arrived in the post,
my father told me the whole story.

1410
01:33:28,352 --> 01:33:31,014
I realized that a million in jewels
had been entrusted...

1411
01:33:31,188 --> 01:33:33,156
...to the care of three madmen.

1412
01:33:33,324 --> 01:33:35,053
I could not compete with them.

1413
01:33:35,226 --> 01:33:38,457
So I came
to the great consulting detective.

1414
01:33:38,629 --> 01:33:39,653
I thought:

1415
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:42,628
"Let him find the treasure for me...

1416
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:47,464
...while I assist in every way I can
to affect the curse. "

1417
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:51,902
Now it is over.

1418
01:33:52,076 --> 01:33:55,102
And only one man stands
between me and the treasure.

1419
01:33:59,483 --> 01:34:01,007
And I...

1420
01:34:02,820 --> 01:34:04,253
...have a pistol.

1421
01:34:05,089 --> 01:34:06,283
Fire it.

1422
01:34:07,258 --> 01:34:10,523
Go on, Miss St. Claire, I beg you.

1423
01:34:10,961 --> 01:34:12,724
Shoot me.

1424
01:34:25,042 --> 01:34:28,011
You have made another mistake.

1425
01:34:28,179 --> 01:34:32,240
This is Watson's starting pistol.
He officiates at races and such.

1426
01:34:32,416 --> 01:34:35,317
It is loaded with blank cartridges.

1427
01:34:35,486 --> 01:34:36,851
But he's...

1428
01:34:37,021 --> 01:34:40,923
He fainted. Understandable
under the circumstances.

1429
01:34:41,092 --> 01:34:43,219
Watson. Come, Watson.

1430
01:34:43,394 --> 01:34:46,158
- Up, old man. Get up.
- What?

1431
01:34:47,331 --> 01:34:49,492
- Watch it.
- Oh, God.

1432
01:34:50,134 --> 01:34:52,364
Oh, you cut your hand, man.

1433
01:34:52,536 --> 01:34:53,560
Oh, God.

1434
01:34:53,738 --> 01:34:57,037
Oh, I'm sorry I ruined
your laboratory, old man.

1435
01:34:57,208 --> 01:34:59,972
Oh, God, I'm shot.

1436
01:35:00,578 --> 01:35:02,409
Well, Mr. Holmes...

1437
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:05,105
...I must congratulate you.

1438
01:35:05,649 --> 01:35:07,844
Whatever shall I do now?

1439
01:35:08,018 --> 01:35:10,782
Think and die.

1440
01:35:10,955 --> 01:35:12,980
Lestrade will be back in a few minutes.

1441
01:35:13,157 --> 01:35:14,920
Then she'll be gone.

1442
01:35:15,092 --> 01:35:17,788
Is the prisoner allowed one last request?

1443
01:35:17,962 --> 01:35:19,657
What is it?

1444
01:35:20,331 --> 01:35:22,492
Let me wear something...

1445
01:35:22,666 --> 01:35:25,635
...just until the inspector arrives.

1446
01:35:26,504 --> 01:35:28,096
Why not.

1447
01:35:40,951 --> 01:35:42,851
Thank you, Mr. Holmes.

1448
01:35:43,521 --> 01:35:45,921
I am content.

1449
01:35:48,058 --> 01:35:50,822
You are an unnatural creature, Miss...

1450
01:35:50,995 --> 01:35:52,292
Unnatural?

1451
01:35:52,463 --> 01:35:54,124
Revenge is a law of human nature.

1452
01:35:54,298 --> 01:35:56,789
- Revenge on your own father?
- He destroyed my mother.

1453
01:35:56,967 --> 01:35:59,458
With a pistol, a dagger, a thorn?

1454
01:35:59,637 --> 01:36:01,161
With greed.

1455
01:36:01,338 --> 01:36:02,430
With opium.

1456
01:36:02,873 --> 01:36:03,931
The wheel, the rack.

1457
01:36:04,108 --> 01:36:07,100
What are these to the last stages
of that addiction?

1458
01:36:07,278 --> 01:36:09,838
Nature herself becomes the tormentor.

1459
01:36:10,014 --> 01:36:11,311
Casts down the wretch...

1460
01:36:11,482 --> 01:36:14,474
...searches every vein,
makes a rod of every nerve.

1461
01:36:14,652 --> 01:36:16,119
It builds fires in the brain...

1462
01:36:16,287 --> 01:36:20,053
...and casts coals of living torment
on the heart.

1463
01:36:20,758 --> 01:36:24,489
She threw herself under the wheels
of a train.

1464
01:36:26,163 --> 01:36:29,564
Am I unnatural, gentlemen?

1465
01:36:33,270 --> 01:36:35,465
Case is closed.

1466
01:36:36,807 --> 01:36:39,435
Oh, Inspector Lestrade, thank heavens.

1467
01:36:39,910 --> 01:36:41,969
Comic relief.

1468
01:36:43,314 --> 01:36:44,975
Well, well.

1469
01:36:45,683 --> 01:36:47,844
Who would have believed it?

1470
01:36:50,054 --> 01:36:53,512
Holmes, how did you know?

1471
01:36:54,158 --> 01:36:56,092
Never mind, you can tell me later.

1472
01:36:56,260 --> 01:36:58,956
- Hopkins.
- Yes, sir.

1473
01:36:59,597 --> 01:37:02,498
- Put those jewels in that chest.
Oh, blimey.

1474
01:37:02,867 --> 01:37:06,234
Keep your opinions to yourself,
Sergeant Hopkins.

1475
01:37:07,738 --> 01:37:09,831
So we have the treasure.

1476
01:37:10,007 --> 01:37:12,567
We have the murderer.

1477
01:37:12,743 --> 01:37:14,768
And we have...

1478
01:37:15,813 --> 01:37:17,303
...this...

1479
01:37:17,815 --> 01:37:20,079
...from Buckingham Palace.

1480
01:37:23,387 --> 01:37:26,823
"Her Majesty Queen Victoria,
Empress of India, will receive...

1481
01:37:26,991 --> 01:37:29,482
...Inspector Lestrade
at 10:00 tomorrow...

1482
01:37:29,660 --> 01:37:32,925
...to tender him her personal thanks
and to accept from his hands...

1483
01:37:33,097 --> 01:37:36,430
...the great treasure of Agra. "

1484
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:39,160
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thank you, Holmes. Thank you.

1485
01:37:39,336 --> 01:37:44,706
I shall, of course, inform Her Majesty
of your assistance in this matter.

1486
01:37:48,412 --> 01:37:51,813
Well, now, young lady.

1487
01:37:51,982 --> 01:37:54,280
There is a dead body in the next room.

1488
01:37:54,451 --> 01:37:56,476
Birdy Johnson.

1489
01:37:59,323 --> 01:38:00,881
Hopkins.

1490
01:38:06,730 --> 01:38:08,163
Holmes.

1491
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:11,161
What am I gonna write in my report?

1492
01:38:11,335 --> 01:38:14,395
I will explain it all to you
in the police wagon, inspector.

1493
01:38:14,572 --> 01:38:16,631
You can make notes.

1494
01:38:17,575 --> 01:38:19,042
Right.

1495
01:38:20,277 --> 01:38:25,613
And when you see the queen tomorrow,
tell the old girl to be careful.

1496
01:38:25,783 --> 01:38:27,410
How's that?

1497
01:38:27,851 --> 01:38:30,649
The treasure is cursed.

1498
01:38:31,956 --> 01:38:35,687
It has already destroyed everyone
who has touched it...

1499
01:38:35,859 --> 01:38:38,487
...since the leper first carried it into Agra.

1500
01:38:38,896 --> 01:38:43,390
But you think it might destroy
Her Majesty?

1501
01:38:43,567 --> 01:38:45,432
And even the British Empire itself?

1502
01:38:45,603 --> 01:38:48,265
Give it to her and see.

1503
01:39:08,659 --> 01:39:10,183
She had a face...

1504
01:39:10,728 --> 01:39:13,288
A man might die for.

1505
01:39:15,466 --> 01:39:19,232
My dear old friend, there is nothing more
to be said or done.

1506
01:39:19,403 --> 01:39:22,702
One day the story can be told.

1507
01:39:22,873 --> 01:39:24,932
Meanwhile, I'll fetch my violin.

1508
01:39:25,109 --> 01:39:31,173
We'll try to forget for half an hour
the miserable ways of our fellow men.

1509
01:39:31,348 --> 01:39:34,647
Thank God this long night is over.

1510
01:39:36,787 --> 01:39:40,279
And I doubt whether I shall spend another
in Baker Street.

1511
01:39:41,291 --> 01:39:43,521
Watson, don't go.

1512
01:39:43,694 --> 01:39:47,357
I'd be lost without my Boswell.

1513
01:39:53,570 --> 01:39:54,628
My friend.

1514
01:40:04,782 --> 01:40:06,181
Well?

1515
01:40:14,491 --> 01:40:16,550
Gentlemen, excuse me.

1516
01:40:16,727 --> 01:40:19,252
I am Captain Mordecai Smith.

1517
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:22,422
- Are you Sherlock Holmes?
- I am.

1518
01:40:22,599 --> 01:40:26,535
This is my best friend and colleague,
Dr. Watson.

1519
01:40:26,704 --> 01:40:28,638
You must be tired, Captain Smith.

1520
01:40:28,806 --> 01:40:32,936
I perceive you have arrived only
this morning from the island of Sumatra.

1521
01:40:34,244 --> 01:40:36,838
Why, yes, but how...?

1522
01:40:37,448 --> 01:40:38,972
No matter, sir.

1523
01:40:39,149 --> 01:40:41,617
What is your story?
You are clearly terrified.

1524
01:40:41,785 --> 01:40:43,309
Terrified.

1525
01:40:43,487 --> 01:40:45,512
Yes, Mr. Holmes.

1526
01:40:45,689 --> 01:40:47,520
But not mad.

1527
01:40:47,691 --> 01:40:51,684
You would think me mad, would you not,
if I told you I had seen a giant rat?

1528
01:40:52,463 --> 01:40:55,694
A rat, sir, as big as a large dog.

1529
01:40:55,866 --> 01:40:58,801
It came out of the forehold this morning
just after we docked...

1530
01:40:58,969 --> 01:41:00,732
...and disappeared into the slums.

1531
01:41:01,972 --> 01:41:04,031
And it held...

1532
01:41:04,208 --> 01:41:06,199
...in its mouth...

1533
01:41:10,614 --> 01:41:14,812
Dr. Watson, would you be good enough
to revive our client?

1534
01:41:14,985 --> 01:41:18,148
You'll find he has a touch of Namibia fever,
I believe.

1535
01:41:18,889 --> 01:41:20,049
Come along, Watson.

1536
01:41:20,224 --> 01:41:22,454
The game's afoot.
