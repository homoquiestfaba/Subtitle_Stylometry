1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
  Come on. What are you doing?  

2
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,600
  What are you doing, Bananas  
  It is your reply.  

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
  Stop juggling.  
  We should stop.  

4
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Come on, Bananas.
Spin him around and select a Butch.

5
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,200
  Stop juggling.  
  The performance is over.  

6
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,200
  Spin him  
  and choose today's Butch.  

7
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,200
  Go home and take a drink.  

8
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,200
-Are you ready for something different?
-Yes ...

9
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,000
He changes the show.

10
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,200
You can not do the role.
Children ...

11
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,600
Look, you little clown.
Spin him as Bananas.

12
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,000
Otherwise, I rip your eyebrows
and attach them in the ass!

13
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,400
-Wait. He chooses a Butch.
Bananas have become Balloony!

14
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,000
Spin him now
and select a Butch.

15
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:44,200
No one can be Butch throughout life,
or bananas for that matter.

16
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,600
But Balloony
... playing with balloons!

17
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 -What the hell are you doing?  
-I want Bananas.

18
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,800
 -I have had enough of this!  
-You ...

19
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,400
Would you like to play with ... Balloony?

20
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,800
-Fuck you, clown!
 -Did I hear right?  

21
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
  Clips!  
  We are given clear for today.  

22
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,200
 -Want to play with ... Balloony?  
 -Fuck you, clown!  

23
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,200
Hurry up, Timmy!
Mom will be too late.

24
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,600
And there was a child
who said "Fuck you".

25
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,400
Meet me at the hotel
about half an hour.

26
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,600
It was not my fault.
It was the kid who said it.

27
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,400
This Ear receiver does not work.

28
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,800
Jack Armstrong wants to talk to you.
We got fired.

29
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
-So he can not do.
-Now he has actually done it.

30
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,000
-Because of the kid?
-He does not think you're funny.

31
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Jack Armstrong is a danger to hell!
He has ruined the show.

32
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,200
We should be working
with normal children on the street again.

33
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,400
Have you thought about people watching
The Banana Show to see the track?

34
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,600
-I can no more.
-The children laugh at it.

35
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,400
-There are others in life.
-Yes, to get adults to cry.

36
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,400
-It will be even worse.
-How?

37
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,600
-Where you meet your girlfriend?
-At the hotel.

38
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,600
-No good idea.
"This is my life, Binky.

39
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,800
Yes, but ...
Laurie is in L.A.

40
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,400
My wife?

41
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,200
-She has nothing to do here!
-You are still married, Bananas.

42
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,800
"I hope Lily is not there.
-Does she have the key?

43
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,600
Yes, of course.
She is my girlfriend!

44
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,600
Wait a minute ...

45
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,800
-What?
-I hope not too late.

46
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Stops you to say it?
My God!

47
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,200
Listen ...
You may go down and stop Lily.

48
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,600
I will prevent possible murder.
I will not go down.

49
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,800
-Can you do me a favor?
-Let me go!

50
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,000
I can explain 80% of it.
The remaining 20% is not important.

51
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,800
You are a lying shit boot.

52
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,400
"We need to talk.
-Really?

53
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,800
This is a lie detector
Speak loudly and clearly.

54
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,800
I love you, Laurie, but ...

55
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
-Now?
-It was a sight for the gods.

56
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,800
I know that sounds stupid,
but I can explain everything.

57
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,200
You will laugh about it later.
Meet me ...

58
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,600
Meet me at the club
about half an hour.

59
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,400
Is it the police? I wish to notify
a legal trouble.

60
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,200
Sunrise Hotel. Third and Washington.
Apartment Bråk.

61
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,400
Assault, yes. And intimidation!
Yes!

62
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,000
-If you leave him?
"We have never been together.

63
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,400
We can talk, Laurie.

64
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,800
Stop the car.
What are you doing?

65
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,600
Stop the car!
We can talk.

66
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,200
I have not been unfaithful
because we have separated.

67
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,600
I hope not to.
You must kill me first, sweetheart.

68
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,400
What are you doing?

69
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,400
Slow down, Laurie!
What are you doing?

70
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,400
Stay!

71
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,800
-How was it?
-Why did you call the police?

72
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,200
Mo Potter, creditors.
How goes it?

73
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,800
 -Sorry, Mo. He is gone.  
-I lose my commission?

74
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,600
 -Oh, yeah.  
-Shit. It was Five thousand.

75
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,600
 -sorry.  
-It is not your fault.

76
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,400
I send a sniffer dog
after him and see ...

77
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,000
... what comes up.

78
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,800
-Go, Mo!
-Mo Potter, creditors.

79
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,800
-I need you, Mo.
-Lenny! What happened?

80
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,800
Come down to Los Feliz prison.

81
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,800
 -What the hell is that noise?  
-It is the heat pipes.

82
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,600
Idioten had a piece in the studio
who went by. They arrested my girlfriend.

83
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,000
-Was it someone who was hurt?
-What does it matter?

84
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:41,000
I pay not enough, huh?
It was a direct question.

85
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,800
-No, leave it be!
-What the hell is happening?

86
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,800
-What is it with you, Mo?
 -Who the hell is that?  

87
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,200
-It is my exfru, Lenny.
  I lose a fortune!  

88
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,400
Add all the other crap aside
and meet me on 15 minutes!

89
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,400
-Go now, boy.
-Where?

90
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Los Feliz prison!
Hear you not?

91
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,800
-Where is it?
-I do it myself!

92
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,800
Take your damn rat dog
with you. And wash it!

93
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,800
-You must fit Timmy tonight.
-I?

94
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,600
-Kid?
-Yes. Your son, Mo.

95
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,400
What are you doing?

96
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,600
Do you think I long
after your rubbish?

97
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,400
My mother is sick
and I have to work extra.

98
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,000
-Get a babysitter.
-Do you not think that I have tried?

99
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:46,600
It is easier now. The only
few hours. I need the job.

100
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,400
Should I lug around on him
all night?

101
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,000
Yes ... But to ensure
that he is going early to bed.

102
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,000
Honey, you stay here with Daddy.
Will it be good?

103
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,600
You have your sandwich
and I bought a book for you.

104
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,800
Do you have personal viewfinder?
Can I not smile?

105
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
This will be good. I love you.
Behave properly now.

106
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,800
Thanks, Mo.
I call you when I have left.

107
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,600
Happy birthday, kid.

108
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,400
Well, you ...

109
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,000
What do you want?
Something to drink? Cola?

110
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,400
Water?

111
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,400
How about a mjölkfri drink?

112
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,200
It makes you sleep.
It is much lime in it.

113
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,000
I have to the police
and organize some things.

114
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:12,600
But I know you are good.
You measure up.

115
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,600
Right, old boy?
You remember that I called you that?

116
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,600
It's Bananas!

117
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,400
-My wife is arrested ...
I'm on the way out. Take your card.

118
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,400
We separated for half a year ago.

119
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,200
-I said nothing about my girlfriend ...
-Take your card.

120
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:50,000
I will try.
She came to my hotel room ...

121
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,800
We have separated,
but we are still married ...

122
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,800
... the police from Los Feliz.
- Right, Binky?

123
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,800
Yes ... Police from Los Feliz.

124
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,800
Maybe I can help you,
but I must rush off now.

125
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,400
Come to the police station.

126
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,200
It is helsjukt. The wife will
and what do you say then?

127
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,400
-I said, "Hello."
- "Hello"? I had said:

128
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,600
"It was you who married you
clown. I just fuck him. "

129
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Talk not so much!

130
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,000
Lily? Don 't talk to the dancers.

131
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,200
The woman is working and toiling away.
Should you not give her some money?

132
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,000
-You, then? Fucking dick.
-I heard it. I   is   a dick.

133
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,400
-But you have never had a taste.
-A little disappointment in my life.

134
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,000
"Small" is the right word.

135
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,200
We are ready, Owen.

136
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,000
-Stop the car.
-What?

137
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,200
-Owen, what are you doing?
-Planet is at. 6 in the morning.

138
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,200
-What are you doing?
-I have to think through some things.

139
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,000
-What is it, Owen?
-See you maybe at the airport.

140
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,800
Owen.
You do not know what God wants!

141
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,400
-The church does not either.
-Owen!

142
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,600
Up with the notes!
The ladies wear course.

143
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,000
This is the last
and then it's you.

144
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,400
She does not bite ... very hard.

145
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,200
I am not afraid.

146
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:09,000
I just wonder how I can
get her to dance for me.

147
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,400
You can throw up some money.
It is her livelihood.

148
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,000
-Now, then?
-Wag with the money away at the door.

149
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,400
It is someone who pays.
They go into the champagne room.

150
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:00,200
Do you not men?
She is death leaking.

151
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:05,000
She just trying to earn some money.
Come on!

152
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,200
Go from there.
You guys in penguin suits ...

153
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,200
Sit at the bar and wait.

154
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,600
You, Buddy Holly ...
To the bar.

155
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,000
-The perverse first business.
-The   is   business.

156
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,600
This is Rick from "Bare It".

157
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,000
We have three guys who are dressed
for priests. The usual ...

158
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,600
They are full and squabbling.

159
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Now is the time!

160
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,200
"We are priests!
-Are you okay, blind?

161
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,000
-No. Asshole scribbled!
-I did not mean ...

162
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,800
"I wait outside.
-It is a misunderstanding.

163
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
-Get away!
-Let us go in peace.

164
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,400
Is this cool enough?
What do you say now?

165
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
It is not just a collar.

166
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,400
This is my church.
In here it is I who am God.

167
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,400
Lily, take the back door!

168
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,800
-There he is.
-Pretend to be a priest ...!

169
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,600
"Then you are a pervert.
I'm a priest!

170
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,000
-Are you priests for real?
-Yes.

171
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,000
Has been.

172
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,000
What should we do with Robert?
We will flight tomorrow.

173
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,000
You can call your boss ...
But a creditor is perhaps better.

174
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,600
If you can set up with security
will we probably get him out.

175
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,600
Are you trying to kill Santa Claus?

176
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:06,000
It could have been worse.
You do not know what the problem is.

177
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,200
You could have been a Santa Claus wreck.

178
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,200
If you can set up with security
, so good.

179
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,600
-Has he hurt himself?
-I realized that it would happen.

180
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,800
Anything can happen.
We are fortunate.

181
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,200
Do you put handcuffs on pregnant
women and throw them in jail?

182
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,000
That girl is my fiancee.
She will feed my son.

183
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,000
If that happens her something
so true i am!

184
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,800
I suggest that you and your fiancee
is in therapy -

185
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,800
-so you learn
to resolve your conflicts in the future.

186
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,400
I go around with a suggestion box
around your neck? No!

187
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,800
I lose ten thousand per hour.
Do you have any solution for it?

188
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,600
-I 'm talking about what you have inside you.
-I 'm talking about money!

189
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,200
-Lenny ...
-What are you, Mo?

190
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,400
-What really happened?
-I have been told.

191
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,400
There was shooting
and my girl was locked up!

192
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,800
-Was anyone hurt?
-She is not aimed at anyone.

193
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,600
"It said nothing about you.
-Now you know it.

194
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,400
This is a school friend.
He taught me to plug toilets.

195
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,200
Throw it
I'll tell him to withdraw.

196
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,600
He who speaks with the creditor
is a storfräsare in the music.

197
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,200
-Do you know who I mean?
Yes, maybe.

198
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,200
It is he.
Lenny something ...

199
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,200
-Sanandra!
-Where are my things?

200
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,600
I hope fucking
that you have not ruined anything.

201
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,200
-Hey, Sanandra.
-Hey, Mo.

202
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,800
-Are you happy now?
-Kiss my ass, Lenny!

203
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,000
Sanandra, wait!

204
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,600
I 'm not going back to the studio.
And not back to the cell.

205
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,400
-What are you talking about?
-What are you doing?

206
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,400
Take it easy, the police officer.
It is nothing.

207
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,600
I have the best producers in L.A.
What is wrong?

208
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,400
Open your ears, dammit.
I can not sing!

209
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,000
Cash-back?
-Mo Potter. What?

210
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,800
Wait a minute.

211
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,400
-Have you approached a priest?
-Yes, one who claims that he is a priest.

212
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,400
I am on Almeida police,
behind the court building.

213
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,400
-Of course you can sing.
-The musicians laughed at me.

214
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,200
-Who laughed at you?
-Why? So you can kick them?

215
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,600
-It must be one p.m. moons.
-What?

216
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,400
It always said my mother
when she was waiting for trouble.

217
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,000
"Perhaps it is the 13 månarnas night."

218
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,600
I am not God anymore.

219
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It must be great to hear
a voice and know that it is God.

220
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,400
For me it was reality.
I had a guide within me.

221
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,800
-What are you gonna do now?
-Wait until I hear him again.

222
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,800
We must return to the studio
and a DAT tape, so ...

223
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,400
Stay!

224
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,400
-Why you playing on the street?
-Sorry.

225
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,800
I saw him not.
I drove almost to him.

226
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,600
Where is your mom?

227
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
-At work.
-What is your name?

228
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,000
-Timmy.
-Where is your father, Timmy?

229
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
Is he a cop?

230
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,200
Lenny, go in and find his father.

231
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,400
Are you okay?
Are you cold?

232
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,200
Is it yours?

233
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,000
Please.
Hold hard in it.

234
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,600
Hold hard
so it does not fly away again.

235
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,800
Bananas.
Your wife must sit for twelve hours.

236
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,600
They released a married woman once.

237
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:32,600
She shot her husband, twelve times
in the groin. It must not happen again.

238
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,400
What an idiot is what allows his son
play out in the parking lot?

239
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,200
-Lenny, good to see you again.
-Is it not amazing?

240
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,600
He was about to be hit.

241
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,600
-That 's my boy.
-Come with me!

242
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:55,200
-Did I not that you would wait?
-Is it your son?

243
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,600
You should be ashamed
that let him walk around here alone.

244
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,200
What is she doing here?

245
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,400
-Are they good?
-Ask him.

246
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,600
Are you okay?

247
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Women are weird. The longing
after what they want.

248
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:29,800
-Fan. He looked this way.
-Should I talk to him?

249
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,200
It does not help.
He is a clown.

250
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,800
-And what does that mean?
-It is getting worse.

251
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,000
What is he doing now?

252
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,600
I never know really
what Bananas do.

253
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,600
Lily, can I come in
and talk to you?

254
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,400
Can we switch places?

255
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,000
Bananas, stop now!

256
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,200
Come on, Lil.
There are two sides of this.

257
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,600
You are attracted to me,
but I can not touch you.

258
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,600
Why must it be so?

259
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,800
You do not do this again, huh?
Well, Timmy.

260
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Lenny ... Sign here,
then you can go.

261
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:44,600
You can have fun with the kid
and I can go and work.

262
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
Turn around.

263
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,000
Bend your forward.

264
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Mr. Potter?
I am Father Thaddeus Phaelan.

265
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:05,200
It applies to a colleague
who have been innocently imprisoned.

266
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,200
Let me finish this first
then we can talk business later.

267
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,600
Whose pager is it?

268
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,000
Wait a minute, you little gangster.
What are you hiding?

269
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,200
It is my mother.

270
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,200
Call the boy Potter again.

271
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,800
Give him a dose of adrenaline.

272
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,800
  We have a donor.  
  boy was going to St. Noel's.  

273
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,000
-Lenny, drive us to the hospital.
-No, Satan!

274
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,200
-I 'm calling to his mother.
-It is always wrong. Ask mom.

275
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,200
We will not ask anybody.
He will to the hospital.

276
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,000
-Let Mo take care of his son.
-He do not even know that he is sick!

277
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:01,400
Her father will never get in. ..
She is on a cruise.

278
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,800
I call her boss.
She will not until tomorrow.

279
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,400
-The boy needs to the hospital.
Jump-in.

280
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,800
Lenny ... I never got the opportunity
to introduce myself.

281
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,400
Binky silver. I am a producer
for a cable television program.

282
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,400
-Which hospital would they?
-St. Noel's.

283
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,600
How can you know so little
if your son?

284
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:36,400
We have been divorced for five years.
I barely know him.

285
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,800
I pay maintenance on time
each month.

286
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,400
My dearest wish is
Sanandra will give birth to my son.

287
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:53,600
And you do not even know
how your son doing?

288
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:58,400
Should not you also criticize me?

289
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,600
Len, I can drive.
So I can tell you more on the road.

290
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,600
Come on, Mo.
You sit in front.

291
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,400
If you wait for a man
will always be too late.

292
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,200
From now on, I never
too late, Lily.

293
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:25,600
-It is too late, Bananas.
-His name is Mr Bananas!

294
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:31,200
Was it not you who was fired
from TV? It was fucking fun.

295
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Whose friend is she?
And what do we do in the hospital?

296
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,400
What?

297
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,000
Listen to this.
Do you know how fucking stupid this is?

298
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,600
Sorry, Father.
I thought how stupid it is.

299
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:51,600
I have known Mo long
and do not know a thing about him.

300
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,600
My private life includes my job.
Are you listening?

301
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,800
It is Sanandra.
Is she not good?

302
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,000
People think she will get the opportunity
just because she is my child.

303
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,200
They give her a chance.
Do you understand?

304
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,000
Yes. She is great ...

305
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,800
Shut up!
I work with guys I like.

306
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,400
My friends, my family, my girl.
That is how I work.

307
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,800
Take it!

308
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,400
-What happened?
-What the hell am I doing here?

309
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,600
-I will die.
-But it is not me.

310
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,600
Can I drink this?
I am a small cat. Meow, meow.

311
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,200
You are a dumb dog ...

312
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,000
Everything will be fine.

313
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,200
Owen ... We can not
do more for the boy.

314
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,400
-We should help Robert.
-He should probably stay where he is.

315
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:56,200
-A sexklubb, huh?
-It was a mistake.

316
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,000
I hate sex.

317
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,600
But I do it anyway.

318
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:10,200
-Stop it.
-She goes nowhere without ...

319
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,800
-I have to go to the bathroom.
-Soon, darling.

320
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,200
Have you murdered your child?
It has already received fingers.

321
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,400
-I just want your number.
-You kill a child!

322
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:51,200
I will give birth.
A renkalv. Can you check?

323
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,600
Ouch, it hurt.

324
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,600
I feel much better now.
Take care of renkalven.

325
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,000
I will tell
the good news for Rudolf!

326
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,400
It is arranged. I have money.

327
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,600
Listen ... Uncle Lenny
accompany you to the bathroom.

328
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,800
I am in there with the doctor
and your dad. We will shortly.

329
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:27,600
-Here. Follow him to the bathroom.
-Then we talk about the studio, huh?

330
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,200
-Have you a cigarette?
-It must not smoke here.

331
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,600
I work in God's secret police.
The devil hit me.

332
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,000
-You know what I mean, right?
-Excuse us.

333
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:56,000
Humor is over return.
We must do something new.

334
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,400
We out of here.
We can not help the boy.

335
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,600
We have enough problems. The show
is stopped and Laurie are in jail.

336
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:09,400
Laurie does not want to sleep with me.
What does she want me to do?

337
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,000
-What is the problem?
-She lacks enthusiasm.

338
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,200
So what, then? Does she not
I have done it without enthusiasm?

339
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,400
-Is it your car?
-How so?

340
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,800
-You can not park here.
-Who says that?

341
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,600
I do.
I am a security guard at the hospital.

342
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,000
But if you are bidding on a cigarette
you can let it stand.

343
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,800
We do not smoke.

344
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Help!
He rapes me!

345
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Can we go now?

346
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:00,400
Need something?
Call me if you want something.

347
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,000
I lose a fortune.

348
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:34,000
Does this long?
I have people waiting on me.

349
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,600
-What do you know about your son?
-Very little. What is it?

350
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:45,200
Operation Paper. Your son
kidney has a capacity of 25%.

351
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:50,600
-He is therefore red blood cells.
-Wait until his mother will.

352
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,800
Moreover, his blood
very unusual.

353
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,200
Is all well there?

354
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,000
-Timmy?
-I feel good.

355
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,000
Timmy!

356
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,800
-Are you sure that you feel good?
-Yes.

357
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,400
Timmy cousin,
Slovo Zastopil -

358
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,200
-have been added
and prepared for transplantation.

359
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,800
He has never given away anything.

360
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,600
Listen to me, shit boot!
Do you understand what's happening?

361
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,200
Your son dies
if you do not sign now!

362
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,400
-Do you know what is going on?
-Yes, a little.

363
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,600
See this finger?

364
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,600
It has belonged to Lenny Keyes once.
Do you know who it is?

365
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
No? Lenny Keyes was the bowler
in Major League.

366
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:45,600
He won thirty games. You think
Perhaps it is a lie, but it is true.

367
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,400
You see this little scar?

368
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,800
Lenny Keyes finger was too far.
And the center was too short -

369
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,400
-so we went to the hospital and changed.
And then I played much better.

370
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,400
-It is not true.
-Jo. I had the record for juniors.

371
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,200
He won twenty-nine matches.
He had the record in Major League.

372
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:13,200
-How do they do?
-It is fantastic with the hospital.

373
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:20,400
They can make everything possible.
The doctor is a kind of magician.

374
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,600
Mo ... Are you okay?

375
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Yes.

376
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,400
-Who are you?
-Lily.

377
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,400
Lily ...
What should I do, Lily?

378
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,800
The doctor, the donor has disappeared.

379
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,400
-What?
-How could he disappear?

380
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:22,600
I gave him adrenaline.
I was away for a while and then ...

381
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,400
Do you mean that it was a false alarm?
There is no donor?

382
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,400
-Unfortunately not.
-What?

383
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:36,600
It is very unfortunate.
Stay with Tim, so we are calling you.

384
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,200
-Tell me one thing for me.
"We must find the donor!

385
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,800
Ask when he left.

386
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,800
-You heard what she said.
-For five minutes ago.

387
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,000
Sanandra!

388
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,600
What is going on, Mo?

389
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,000
-I do not know, Lenny.
-What do you mean?

390
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,800
It was a misunderstanding,
Monsignore.

391
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
  You got that right in. Are you sure  
  that it was a strippklubb?  

392
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,400
-Yes, it was.
 -Was there any sign?  

393
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,400
-Yes, that was it.
 -Did you see it?  

394
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,800
-No, it was very small.
 -What was it?  

395
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,800
"Bare It".

396
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
He may not have got far.

397
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,600
Damn! - Timmy donor
must be here somewhere.

398
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,000
Is that him?

399
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,600
-Where are you going?
 -Thaddeus!  

400
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,000
Now she is together with
the priest again. What is happening?

401
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,200
Lily does not want to talk to you,
understand you do not it?

402
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,800
Well, you ...
What would you do?

403
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,600
"We can do whatever you want.
-It does not matter, Dad.

404
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,000
I'm expecting mom.
You do not stay.

405
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,400
Shall we go to the zoo?

406
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,800
-You used to love the zoo.
-You promised that we would see monkeys.

407
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:30,000
"But we did not.
-Would you like to do it?

408
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,600
-Want to see the monkeys?
-It is not possible. It is closed.

409
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,800
What idiots!
They do not respond when you threaten them.

410
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
-See you.
-Where are you?

411
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,800
-I go to the zoo with my son.
-Monsignore, it was a ...

412
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,800
-Is it the car keys?
-Yes. It is Lily.

413
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,800
Thank you.

414
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,800
-Hello! Where are you?
I'm right back.

415
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,400
Wait!

416
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Mo!

417
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,600
-Where are they?
-To the zoo, I think.

418
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,200
-Have you seen Sanandra?
-She went with Owen and the stripper.

419
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,200
-They went that way.
-I must find her.

420
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,600
-I must find her Owen.
-I need to find Lily.

421
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,600
-I will go with you, Len.
-You sit in front.

422
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,800
Since he can walk
he can not be so close to death.

423
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,800
There is something there.

424
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Closed. Damn!

425
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:46,200
Imagine that you are a stupid,
alcoholic drug addict -

426
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,600
-with mental health problems
and internal bleeding.

427
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:59,000
-Where would you go?
-That I dare not even guess.

428
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,800
I need a drink.

429
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,800
Where the hell are they then?

430
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
You hear that, Bananas?

431
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,800
Look!
I saw something down there.

432
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,000
-Are you sure?
-Enough.

433
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:02,600
-Come on, come on ...
-Watch your page!

434
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,800
-What the hell?
-Binky are funny.

435
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
-When you're used to his humor.
-I 'm not laughing!

436
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,400
Lenny ...
I go out and pushes you.

437
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,800
I know who you mean.
He was here before.

438
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,200
-I do not know his name.
-When was he here?

439
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,200
Before he was hit.
I had to ask him to leave.

440
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,800
Come on ... to the left.

441
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,800
-I do indeed!
-Left!

442
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,200
What are you doing?
Are you going to destroy his family fortune?

443
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:56,200
Instead of criticizing me
so think when Lenny says something.

444
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,000
You can at least pretend
as if you are listening.

445
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,600
All rich guys are the same.
They have forgotten you tomorrow.

446
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Fucking cripple! If you CRASH
my car and you'll replace it!

447
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,200
Did you hear?
"Fucking cripple"?

448
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,000
Your new friend talking to you, Binky!

449
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
This with
Lily wants to leave Bananas ...

450
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,800
Everyone understands it but he.

451
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,800
Will you and Mr Bananas
not at all on the kid?

452
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,800
No, not really.
I got my own problems.

453
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:44,800
The show is stopped, and my partner
believe that humor is superfluous.

454
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,400
-Here are just drug addicts.
-Slovo is the drug addict.

455
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,400
Since he is a damn poor,
small pundarjävel. Do you?

456
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:01,000
-Owen, the fuck with you.
-I know Slovo. The asshole.

457
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:06,600
-He has whores on Market Street.
-It may be he.

458
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,800
He is a lefty.
I remember that very well -

459
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,400
-for he holds his balls
so when he piss on you.

460
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,400
So disgusting!
-He threw water on me.

461
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,600
-Look at Sunset Boulevard.
-Check it out here, shit boot!

462
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,800
Or this!

463
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,200
Can I help you?

464
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:20,400
-We would like to see the monkeys.
-Unfortunately, the zoo is closed.

465
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:26,000
I have promised the kid
that we would see monkeys.

466
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:31,800
He is sick, so it is important.
It is a full moon ...

467
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,200
Can you not help a sick boy
having a bad father?

468
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,200
Zoo is closed!

469
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,800
Open the gate.

470
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,600
I earn $ 380 a week.
I also have kids.

471
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,800
Are you a better dad
if you shoot me?

472
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,800
"I risk my job.
-We know that. Not true?

473
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,600
We are just like Indiana Jones.

474
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,000
Let's look at the worms ...
I mean monkeys.

475
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Ask them there.

476
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,800
Hello ...
I'm looking for some women.

477
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,200
-What women?
-Two beautiful women and a priest.

478
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,600
-Stick!
-Come here.

479
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,200
I want to talk to you.

480
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:42,800
-Do you know anything about women?
-Everything is so chaotic.

481
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:48,600
Men and women and what the hell ...
Who are you and what are they?

482
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
He is a pound key.
I saw him at the hospital.

483
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:57,400
"I almost beat him up.
-What do you know about the women?

484
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,400
I know maybe something,
but I want money.

485
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,800
-I have money. Come on!
-Hit them.

486
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,800
-Here.
-I love you!

487
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:12,800
-Do you know where they went?
-Sure. That way.

488
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,400
Come back when you have found them
so we partying. My treat.

489
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:21,200
But that idiot like I did not.

490
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,400
And you, you little shit ...
I will kick your ass!

491
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:29,200
-Want to fight?
Yes, come on.

492
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:35,000
If you are Binky
strikes me you apart and together!

493
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,200
Take it easy. I need to find
my girl. She is pregnant.

494
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,000
-Goddamn it!
-Keep looking.

495
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:47,000
-Slovo is perhaps on the roof.
-Shut up!

496
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,400
This is hopeless.

497
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,000
What are we doing?

498
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,800
-What is it?
-Nothing.

499
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,400
Here. Give me that.

500
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,600
Lenny think I expect his children.

501
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,800
I had an abortion two weeks ago.

502
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,400
But I dare not tell
for him.

503
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,600
Not so fast!
Look over there at the container.

504
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,400
Is it not they?

505
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,600
-What are they doing?
"We can save this child.

506
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,200
Timmy living, Lily.

507
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,000
-It is something completely different.
-I know.

508
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:32,000
-We continue to look, huh?
-Yes.

509
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:40,600
-Are they lesbians?
-Think you! She is my child.

510
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,800
But your problem
with these women -

511
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,200
-may have a different cause.

512
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,600
And Lenny says:
"Think about what you say."

513
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,400
Owen?

514
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,000
Where the hell are they now?

515
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:07,000
Take care, my friend.
It is not him.

516
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:17,800
-Did you hear what I said to Lily?
-Yes.

517
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,400
I love you, Lily!
I sacrifice my life for you!

518
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,600
What about him?
Why does he scream?

519
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,800
-He has it hard.
-He must realize the truth.

520
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,200
-What are you doing?
-Looking for Timmy donor.

521
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,400
And so you just run around
without saying anything to me?

522
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,800
-Don 't you see that I get worried?
-Calm down and help us.

523
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,000
Honey, there are thousands of pounds
on the streets.

524
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,800
His name Slovo Zasto ...
or something.

525
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,800
He left the hospital on foot
and have no money.

526
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,800
-Can we talk?
-You paid someone. Was it him?

527
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,800
Are you my personal nightmare, huh?

528
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,400
Wait ... What guy?
Be somewhere?

529
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:14,000
I have a pocket full of clover.

530
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,000
-Do you know what you have?
-No. What do I have?

531
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,200
Not shit.

532
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
-Your crazy bastard.
-It hurts! Damn.

533
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,800
I bleed ...
Waste-not bleed. They rot.

534
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:35,000
-Come. I buy you a drink.
-Why did you have no money before?

535
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,400
Do you want them, you come here
and give me a kiss.

536
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,800
-Stop it.
-I kill you!

537
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,800
-I think he is in love with you.
-Do not go.

538
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:54,200
What the hell is this?
You have my suit.

539
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,200
It is fucking my suit!

540
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,600
See what I mean?

541
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,800
It is difficult to know quite certainly
who does what with whom.

542
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,600
Come with something constructive, Binky.
Otherwise, stomach ache again.

543
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Thank you, Father.

544
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:33,000
I invite all to a round!
Priests do not drink, huh?

545
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:38,400
We have to kill people for
to earn money. How much did you get?

546
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Lily! What are you doing here?
Are you tired of paying the booze?

547
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,600
We are looking for a guy
who is hurt bad.

548
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,800
-Have you seen him?
-No.

549
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
No, we do not.

550
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:02,000
You do not stay.
We shall probably find him.

551
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,600
-What do you say, Owen?
-I will stay.

552
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:09,800
That is a good thing,
but you are actually a little in the way.

553
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:15,000
Lenny and I have problems with
women. You do not improve matters.

554
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,000
-Should we not help the boy?
-Yes, yes.

555
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:22,200
But women also.
It is a little complicated.

556
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:28,600
Why not help your fellow
who is in prison?

557
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,200
-Did you to their problems, Owen?
"This is what I mean.

558
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:38,000
You do not really understand it
with women, right?

559
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:43,400
You understand, perhaps one third,
but of three thirds.

560
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,200
I go nowhere
until the boy is safe.

561
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:53,200
-What about him?
-He hears voices.

562
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,600
Voices?

563
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,400
-Have you seen anything?
-The guy has blood on it.

564
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:07,800
-Why are you doing?
-I cut myself when I shaved me.

565
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:11,600
The great lover has not had enough.

566
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,000
Is not it amazing?
Idioten come back.

567
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:22,800
A dry Chianti. Omrörd, not shaken.
With olive and ...

568
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,800
-Is he?
-Yes.

569
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,800
What can I offer
two beautiful women?

570
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:40,400
What the hell?
Am I at Roscoe's?

571
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:47,600
Give me the waffles and chicken.
And some wine with it.

572
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,800
Third round?
-Final Round.

573
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:08,800
I just wanted to let the odd evenly.
There is no problem.

574
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,200
-Come. You going to the hospital.
-I feel good.

575
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:18,800
Give me something to drink.
-You walked before you had been helped.

576
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,200
The doctors wanted to pick out my body
before I was dead.

577
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:27,600
-There is nobody who wants to kill you.
-Who the hell are you talking to?

578
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:31,800
Do you think
I listen to you, bitch?

579
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:37,000
-You are corrupt. It is true.
-Is it really ass donor?

580
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,400
Give me a drink.
-His kidney is similar certainly a taco.

581
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:46,200
I would like to propose a toast.
- For you, sockerpullor.

582
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:51,000
I like to donate
my favorite body to you.

583
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:57,000
Should we not get drunk and naked
and stick in our bodies i. ..

584
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,800
Owen!

585
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:11,600
-Owen, release him!
-She has the right, Owen.

586
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,200
-Take it easy.
-Make him about it, Father?

587
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,800
It will conclude that we are
arrested for murder. He hears voices.

588
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,200
We must take him to the hospital.

589
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:31,000
-Do you want to see them close up, Timmy?
-Want that?

590
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,600
-Is it close enough?
-Yes.

591
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,000
He just wants to health.

592
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:52,200
-Is it fun?
-Yes.

593
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,400
He is a true fighter, huh?

594
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,800
-Mo Potter.
"We have found the donor.

595
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,600
He is unconscious.
Come to the hospital with Timmy.

596
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,400
Yes. Hello.

597
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:15,000
Just because I'm unconscious
I agree not to die.

598
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,800
-Close the fucking music!
-Take your filthy hands!

599
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,400
-Keep your fingers, bitch!
-Now it fucking be enough.

600
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,800
Move it!

601
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:35,800
Concerned he you? I kill him.
-Lenny, do not do it!

602
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,800
How is it, Lenny?

603
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,400
If you want my kidney
so you must kill me!

604
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:46,600
Do you bad!
There is no one wants to kill you!

605
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,800
Look, Dad!

606
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,200
Is there nothing you want?

607
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,000
Lenny, take him down here!

608
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:09,200
Jo. I would like ...

609
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,800
... some friends ...

610
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,600
... and beautiful women ...
... and so I would have ...

611
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:23,800
Give me a TV set,
alcohol and drugs -

612
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,200
and more drugs
case I will not ...

613
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:32,400
Listen.
Alcohol, women and all things are going well.

614
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:36,600
But a television, I can not arrange
until Tuesday.

615
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:44,000
I got all the rest.
Only you will help the boy.

616
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,800
You are priests.
Go up and talk to him.

617
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:53,600
Maybe it's my last night.
HERE GOES.

618
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:58,600
-Come on home to me.
-Oh my God ... I fall down!

619
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,000
Come now.

620
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,600
Stay there, old boy.
-Are you okay?

621
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:20,200
-My dad took me to the zoo.
-What is happening?

622
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,400
I had to negotiate
to get him down.

623
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:27,800
Whores, alcohol and drugs,
mr creditors. Lenny pay.

624
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,600
-Know how sick he is Lenny?
-Better than you, old man!

625
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:36,400
Keep the boy and the clown
situated away from me.

626
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:41,200
-Are you all right, Lenny?
-I have no choice.

627
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,600
Mr Bananas?

628
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:25,200
Mr. Bananas, you
that gorillas can swim?

629
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:30,200
I knew that they could not dance,
but I did not know that.

630
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,800
Bananas have a banana to the gorilla.
Show them that.

631
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,800
-Not now.
-Show them, Bananas.

632
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,400
Stop.
I am not Bananas longer.

633
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:04,000
Come now.
Lenny, I love you!

634
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:07,200
"This will be with.
"It said nothing about you.

635
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:11,800
Well, I did some.
You may not heard.

636
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Unpack them!
- Was it a high enough?

637
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,400
Or should I say it again?

638
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,800
What are you looking at, fool?

639
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,400
I just came on
what nice mother you could have been.

640
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,200
How are you?

641
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,400
I am a businessman.
I know how the tours going.

642
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:54,000
Why are you so happy
save little Timmy?

643
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:58,200
-If you kill me, he is finished.
-There is nobody who wants to kill you.

644
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:03,000
Except me. But I hate
prison too much.

645
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,400
Lenny, this is fun!
I love it.

646
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:13,200
It is nice to sit and talk,
exchange confidential called ...

647
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:18,600
Open our small, secret doors ...
Whatever.

648
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:23,000
Stay here!
We will have more guests.

649
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:29,000
When we come home to me
you behave yourself properly!

650
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:34,400
-Hey!
-Come in and shut the door.

651
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:38,800
Welcome to my jungle show.

652
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,200
I have no use for you.
- What is your name?

653
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:46,200
-Where should we sit?
-What?

654
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:51,400
-Where should we sit?
-For my little friend's face.

655
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:57,000
-Your girls are sitting on your face.
-It was not nice to say ...

656
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,800
-Stop it!
-Take it easy.

657
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,800
"JINGLE OF SLEIGH BELLS, JINGLE OF SLEIGH BELLS ..."

658
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:16,400
What 's he doing there?
The fucking losern.

659
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:53,000
-I want to stay here!
-Now disconnect of my house ...

660
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:58,200
Now I will arrange this.
- Is God with me, Father?

661
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,200
Look up! He has a gun.

662
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,800
Have you been completely insane?

663
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,800
Keep him.
What is wrong with you?

664
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,600
Lenny!

665
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,800
-Be careful, Timmy.
-Say something to your son.

666
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,600
Let my father.

667
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:34,600
Timmy ... old boy.
Put away the gun.

668
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,200
What should I do, boss?

669
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:41,600
Timmy ... You do not want
that someone will get hurt, huh?

670
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:47,400
-They may not make a bad father.
-They do not. Watch ...

671
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:56,200
-Dad?
-Timmy, we are just playing.

672
01:05:56,600 --> 01:06:01,800
Dad feels good. Go you
with Sanandra and priests.

673
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,600
Come on, Timmy.

674
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:09,400
Bind him. I do not want to see him
until tomorrow morning!

675
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:15,800
-What are you, priest?
-Owen.

676
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,800
Owen ...

677
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:26,000
When I keep Timmy in the hand
I am not afraid of anything.

678
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:31,400
It was the same when he was little.
But I forgot.

679
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:37,600
Let me
so I can take care of my son.

680
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
God do not like this.

681
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,400
Bastard ...!

682
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:24,000
-How is Lily?
-Not so good.

683
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,000
-Lenny, then?
-Not so good.

684
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:35,800
Happy birthday, Lenny!
Lenny is cool!

685
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,800
He is the best.

686
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,600
As long as he sings
We know at least where he is.

687
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:50,000
What is it with Timmy?
-He is up there and sleep.

688
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:57,000
-You idiot ... What are you doing?
-What is he doing?

689
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:01,400
-You do not impress anybody.
"I sacrifice my life for Lily.

690
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:07,400
-You can not make it so.
-How long?

691
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:11,600
-Two minutes, maybe.
-Fuck you! At least three.

692
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:16,600
Viewership she here?
Did she do it?

693
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,200
What to see?
A clown with skull in the pool?

694
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:27,000
Screams that I have become lax.
And you, I hear you down there.

695
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:31,800
And him, you have slept with.
-What do we do?

696
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,800
Come on, Bananas.
Time has passed.

697
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,000
  Come on, Bananas!  
  Spin child and select a Butch.  

698
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,400
Fuck you, clown!

699
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,600
Nifty. Now we're both wet.
Are you satisfied now?

700
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:00,400
-Fan ...
-Don 't you see that I want to die?

701
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:04,400
-I go.
-No, stay here.

702
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:09,400
-This is about a child.
-Yes. But I need you.

703
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,600
How pathetic you are!

704
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,600
-Excuse me.
-Yes, please!

705
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:20,000
Can you help him
so I listen gladly. Otherwise not.

706
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:26,800
Lily, I can not help him.
I'm just empty inside.

707
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,800
I used to hear funny things
inside the head.

708
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:39,600
-I do not anymore.
-You are a good clown, Bananas.

709
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,800
But you care not about the kids more.

710
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:50,600
Lily says that I left
be fun for ...

711
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:56,000
Nonsense, I think.
Not to be shitty, Lily -

712
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:59,000
-but Bananas was funny
before he met you -

713
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:03,800
and that you are lesbian
has nothing to do with it.

714
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,600
It does absolutely nothing
if you are a lesbian.

715
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,800
-Binky ...
Yes, Lily. Wearing say it.

716
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:15,600
I'm not a lesbian.
-It does not matter.

717
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:20,600
I think just on the track.
I love him.

718
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,800
-Binky, now go.
-She has ruined your sex life.

719
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:29,400
Stop it!
It was not what was the problem.

720
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:34,400
Well, maybe for her.
This is what I say.

721
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:38,200
You fucked her.
That was why she became a lesbian!

722
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:43,000
Children have a natural strength.

723
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:46,600
My neighbor has a boy
who like that I will.

724
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:52,800
When I am with him
I ignore everything else.

725
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:57,400
I need a pinch of air.
Watch him. I will shortly.

726
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,000
Owen.

727
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:05,800
Owen, wait!

728
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:11,800
-How is Mo?
-Good. Just great.

729
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,600
What is it?
What are you seeing?

730
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,200
-What is it?
-No!

731
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:29,800
Listen ...

732
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:37,200
I have decided.
So let me be in peace.

733
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:43,400
-Are you gonna shoot him?
-Time is running out.

734
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:49,400
I must ensure that this success.

735
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,600
Do you know if the gun is secured?

736
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,800
-Lily ...
-No. Owen is right.

737
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
I may look at the gun.

738
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:07,800
-Forget it, Owen. It does not work.
-Lily ... Listen!

739
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Slovo do not play anymore.
He has left!

740
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:16,800
Owen, come!
Slovo has disappeared.

741
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,600
It is only Peewee.
He does not litter.

742
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,200
Where are you?
The party is down here.

743
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:43,400
-Where are Slovo?
-Don 't think about him.

744
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:47,800
Why are you so wet?
Where are you?

745
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,800
-Wait a minute ...
-Let me go. You do not own me!

746
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,600
Now I understand.
You let the stripper take ...

747
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:04,600
-Turn your child's father?
-There are no children, Lenny.

748
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:14,600
-Stop it.
-There is no children.

749
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,200
-I did the abortion.
-It is ...

750
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:27,200
Bullshit, Sanandra. 

751
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:30,600
-You can not do that to me.
-On you?

752
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,200
What the hell is wrong with you?
"In you"?

753
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,800
I, then?
And Timmy?

754
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,600
What the hell are you looking at?

755
01:13:54,800 --> 01:14:00,400
Get out of here, everybody.
Right away!

756
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:06,200
Remove that monster.
Lion wants to eat me up.

757
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:10,200
He will squash your balls
if I ask him.

758
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,800
-Lenny said nothing about lions!
-Go to the hospital.

759
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,400
-If I plug the lion in you.
-Fuck you, bitch!

760
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:21,800
Give me the bottle.
- And take off my clothes, bitch!

761
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,600
-I do not understand what is happening.
-Timmy is gone.

762
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:29,400
There is someone in the pool!

763
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:36,000
-Oh my God ...
-Timmy!

764
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:43,800
-You are destroying our number!
-What kind of numbers?

765
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,200
-He terrified the people with cold feet.
-Man must overcome his fear.

766
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:52,200
-Shit in the pool, only.
-Or piss.

767
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:58,400
All pee in the pool.
Do never away from the edge, just.

768
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:03,800
-There should be meaningful, Lil.
-There should be meaningful, Lily.

769
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,000
-What?
-Timmy.

770
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:14,200
Bananas, take him up
before he is cold!

771
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:19,000
Sanandra, let the kid be.
He is playing of course.

772
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:22,600
Course teaches me to swim!
-Yes, but ...

773
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,400
Sanandra.
Let him be.

774
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:30,600
What the hell are you, Lenny?
You can not swim.

775
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,200
I am exhausted.

776
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:38,000
I have given away all my energy.
Now there is nothing left.

777
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:45,000
I can not anymore. I am tired.

778
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I am tired.

779
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:57,000
-Teach me to swim, Bananas!
-Lenny!

780
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:02,600
-Lenny, you big idiot!
-Bananas to the rescue!

781
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,600
All down in the pool!

782
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:27,200
-And God created woman.
-Yes!

783
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,400
Come!

784
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:58,000
I live. I live!

785
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:03,000
I have decided
to donate my kidney.

786
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,800
It does not matter which.

787
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:11,000
I wish only to be reborn.

788
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,000
What is he doing?

789
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,800
Oh God ...

790
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,400
Lenny, help me!
He has seizures!

791
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:35,600
I think he was shocked.
Get some towels!

792
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
He needs to the hospital.

793
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,200
Listen ...

794
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:11,200
Timmy may be just what he wants.

795
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:24,200
Say it was a Christmas present
from Santa Claus. Yes ...

796
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Santa Claus ...

797
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,800
It is Slovo Zastopil.
The boy should have his kidney.

798
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,400
-Take him away from the table.
"This time we do not. Come on!

799
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:53,400
One at a time.
One moment.

800
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,800
You with the medallion ...
Complete this.

801
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,800
The man is dead. The boy is in a coma.
Make sure to do something!

802
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,800
Doctor ...
We found the donor.

803
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,200
-He is dead.
-When did he die?

804
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:12,000
Approximately 10 minutes later.

805
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:30,800
Mr. Potter, we did everything we could -

806
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,400
-but the donor organ was destroyed.

807
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:41,400
I do not
how he could live so long.

808
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:45,600
But Timmy, then?
Are they good?

809
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,600
He gets dialysis and ...

810
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:57,200
 -I can not hear God anymore.  
 -What will you do now?  

811
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:05,400
  Wait until I hear him again.  

812
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,600
Doctor ...

813
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:34,000
I would like to talk to you
between four eyes.

814
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:47,000
When understood Owen
that he had the same blood?

815
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:54,200
He tested two weeks ago.
But it was something that Timmy said.

816
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:58,600
-I want to be with him.
-Wait a minute, honey.

817
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,600
Let him be together
with Owen and his father.

818
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,800
-Sanandra, we take a torch.
-Yes, do it.

819
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,800
I will stay here
if Mo needs me.

820
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:26,000
Thanks, Owen.

821
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:31,800
"I look at Timmy.
-Good.

822
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:42,600
My name is Vincent. I will
make you ready for the operation.

823
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:46,800
I will make sure
You will not feel anything.

824
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:49,400
Thank you, Vincent.

825
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:01,400
Are you sure
you know what you are doing?

826
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,600
You are a better priest than me,
Thaddeus.

827
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:12,800
Maybe.
But you are a better person.

828
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,800
Please feel free to kiss him.
I tell it to anyone.

829
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:22,600
Where are you going?
I would like to speak with you.

01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,400
Bananas ...
You taught me to swim.

831
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:30,400
Forget about the one where the cable shit.
We are doing something else together.

832
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:35,200
-Are you willing to discuss percentages?
-Exactly.

833
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,200
Sorry ...
Is this the dialysis department?

834
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:47,400
-I 'm looking for a little boy ...
-Timmy is in preparation.

835
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,800
Timmy feel good?

836
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:58,400
Mo, I have received your information.
I tried to call ...

837
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:04,600
-How is my little boy?
-Timmy 's fine.

838
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:12,200
What are the people?
The two women and ...

839
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,600
They have helped Timmy.

840
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:20,200
Why?
They know not him.

841
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:26,600
I do not know.

842
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,600

843
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,800
A Lenny Rollins paid bail

01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Bananas.
-Mrs Bananas drive home.

845
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:58,000
It has been a tiring night, Thad.
Where is Owen?

846
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:00,200
Thad?

847
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,400
Do you think Owen do?

848
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:46,600
Look there.
What a night, huh?

01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:09,400

Bill Nisselson, Rockets Red Glare -
