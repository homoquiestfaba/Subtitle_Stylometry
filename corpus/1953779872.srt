1
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:23,967
<i>There once were some Irish folk,
but sadly, they were quite broke.</i>

2
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:28,668
<i>So they packed up their crates
and moved to the States,</i>

3
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,440
<i>and their fortune,
they brought in a poke.</i>

4
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:38,512
<i>Now, their luck, it came fast,
and their fortunes grew vast,</i>

5
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:42,519
<i>because they stole the
luck of a creature.</i>

6
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:47,046
<i>But the thing got away,
and their gold turned to hay.</i>

7
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:52,290
<i>The town was appalled,
and fools they were called,</i>

8
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:56,061
<i>for ever daring to gain
from the dreaded luchorpain.</i>

9
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:03,000
<i>But that all came 
long before me.</i>

10
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,342
<i>My part in this tale
starts exactly as it ends.</i>

11
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,781
<i>With a bang.</i>

12
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:22,718
You missed it high right, toots. You're
too good a shot to miss it high right.

13
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:25,422
Let's adjust that sight.

14
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:29,592
Life is all about math,
alchemy, and luck.

15
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,535
With us O'Haras, it's mostly luck.

16
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,431
Yeah, you and that lucky boar's tooth.

17
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,669
It's an irrational world.

18
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:41,772
I don't make the rules.
I just break them.

19
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,744
Do you really believe all that stuff?

20
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:50,413
You know, luck and fairies and magic?

21
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,115
I certainly do.

22
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,886
No, but really. You really believe it?

23
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,894
There are more things
in heaven and earth, Henrietta,

24
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,760
than are dreamt of in 
your philosophy.

25
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,799
- What?
-Exactly.

26
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:20,716
- You got one in the chamber?
-No.

27
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,117
Put one in.

28
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,156
There it is. Follow me. Come on.

29
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,133
Pop!

30
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,426
- Karen, you all right?
-Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

31
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,261
- I thought I told you to follow me.
-I know. I got a little turned around.

32
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:41,335
You okay? Is she okay? You okay?

33
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,314
She's fine. She just kind of spun around
and knocked down.

34
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,112
Fell down? Honey, sweetheart,
are you doing all right?

35
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:50,312
You gonna tell me
what happened out there?

36
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:51,616
I was walking...

37
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,886
How many times have I told you
those damn boars are dangerous!

38
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:57,018
You don't even have a hunting license,
for Pete's sake!

39
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,393
What the hell do I need
a hunting license for? I know you.

40
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:03,866
If you knew me, you'd know how pissed off
I'd be if I knew you took her out.

41
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,529
It's one thing to put
your own life in danger.

42
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,239
All right? It's quite
another to put Karen's.

43
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,468
You're crossing the line, old man. What?

44
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,042
She's very capable.

45
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,607
I don't know what you see, okay? But
when I look at her, I see a little girl.

46
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,478
- Well, open your eyes.
-My eyes are open.

47
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,243
And you know what they see?

48
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:23,879
They see the whole town
saying your pop is a lunatic.

49
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,082
And you know what?
I've been defending you till now.

50
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:29,354
Because I believe them.
They're right. They're all right.

51
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:35,397
What? I hurt your feelings? I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

52
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,788
What in the hell?

53
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,797
I should have mowed my cat and dog.

54
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,988
What in the hell?

55
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,299
You want my gold tooth?

56
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,649
Are you sure you're all right?

57
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,325
Dad, I didn't...

58
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:47,262
Didn't just fall in the woods.
Something attacked me.

59
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,793
Attacked?
What do you mean something attacked you?

60
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,195
An animal?

61
00:09:56,162 --> 00:10:00,542
It got caught in some roots,
I shot it, and it ran.

62
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,610
Well, I'm glad you're safe,

63
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:07,242
but you've got to make sure you know
what it is you're shooting at, honey.

64
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,112
What?

65
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,386
I'm just glad that Pop's teaching you
to take care of yourself.

66
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,100
Hey, Hap.

67
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,507
Top of the morning to you.

68
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,206
Grab some real estate.
I'll be right with you.

69
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,510
Lucky number seven.

70
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:46,284
You ready to talk about it,
or I have to wait to number eight?

71
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,825
And don't give me any of that
"we don't talk about that crap."

72
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,759
We don't talk about that crap.

73
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,708
Almost got Karen killed.

74
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,341
What? How?

75
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,373
Hunting. Keening Woods.

76
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,415
Tempting fate hunting over there
all the time. You know that, right?

77
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,417
Haven't found any fairy folk
over there in over 100 years.

78
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:19,854
But something's wrong.

79
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,188
Don't start with the leprechauns again.

80
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,659
I'm still picking teeth off the floor

81
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,595
from the last fight you started
over those damn things.

82
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,662
Here.
Just be glad you're not old man McHenry.

83
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,394
What's that supposed to mean?

84
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,596
Well, his bed-and-breakfast
burned down on Tuesday. Look.

85
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:39,670
Anybody get hurt?

86
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,002
No, but still...

87
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,981
Luck of the Irish.

88
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,217
No number eights
till you stop with the leprechaun crap.

89
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,016
What can I do for you fine folks?
Starting a bit early, aren't you?

90
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,017
Dad?

91
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:26,949
Dad?

92
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,224
<i>Hello. Hi, honey.</i>

93
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:45,758
- God. I think something's in the house.
-You what?

94
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,534
The door's open. The alarm went off.
I think someone's here!

95
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,905
<i>Go to your room right now
and lock the door.</i>

96
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,944
<i>Go. Move. Now. I can't hear you.</i>

97
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,172
<i>- Why aren't you walking?
I can't hear you. -Okay.</i>

98
00:13:58,938 --> 00:13:59,939
<i>Are you there?</i>

99
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,014
<i>Are you... I heard the door. 
Are you in?</i>

100
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:10,124
<i>Sweetie? All right. Now listen to me.
Are you sure about this? Honey?</i>

101
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,252
Yeah.

102
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:15,231
<i>Okay. Then you do exactly as I say.</i>
<i>You get under the bed right now.</i>

103
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,927
<i>It's the safest place you could be.
Go. Hello?</i>

104
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,464
<i>You're dead, Karen. 
You're dead.</i>

105
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,736
<i>You're dead, 
and you don't even know it.</i>

106
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,841
Hurry up!

107
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,080
Hey.

108
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:12,418
Hey. Why didn't you tell me
you weren't coming to school?

109
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,152
Yeah. Sorry.
I only decided a few minutes ago.

110
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,252
What's that?

111
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,188
Some kind of weird plant rash.

112
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,196
Okay. You look weird. What's wrong?

113
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,565
I was attacked.

114
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,605
What? By who?

115
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,074
Some animal out in the woods.

116
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,973
Holy crap, Karen. Are you okay?

117
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:36,206
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Pop was there. I had my gun.

118
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,270
I shot at it, and it ran.

119
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,873
If you need me to bail, 
I totally can.

120
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,348
No, that's fine. Just go to
school, and I'll see you later.

121
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,616
- Are you sure?
-Yeah.

122
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,352
- All right. Feel better.
-Yeah.

123
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,552
Bye.

124
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,228
- Karen, hey.
-Hey, Karl.

125
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,467
<i>Hey. Yeah, 
from the Keening Courier.</i>

126
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,510
I also have that blog that I write 
called Strange Happenings.

127
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,476
- I have seen it.
-Cool.

128
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,974
You were at the pharmacy.
You're not feeling too good?

129
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:12,276
Not really, no.

130
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,046
Well, anyway, I was wondering 
if you had a minute,

131
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:19,715
you want to talk to me about that
experience you had out in Keening Woods?

132
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,280
Because I saw the police report
your dad wrote

133
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,258
that you were attacked by an animal,

134
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,853
but you weren't able
to identify it completely.

135
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,660
So, I was just wondering
if you could describe it for me.

136
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:32,259
No, Karl, I do not feel comfortable
doing that for your blog.

137
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,794
- Okay. Strange creature, huh?
-No.

138
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,170
- Unearthly? Otherworldly?
-No.

139
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,234
- Karl!
-No. Yeah. But, see...

140
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,141
I was doing research on the area
that you were hunting in,

141
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:48,848
and I just noticed that it was
right next to the Tree of Tears,

142
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,215
and I was wondering
if anything strange happened.

143
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:52,945
Wait.

144
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:55,983
What is the Tree of Tears?

145
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,990
It's right smack
in the middle of Keening Woods.

146
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,587
- You heard of it?
-No.

147
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:03,098
As legend has it, it's...

148
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:06,864
The town has some dark secrets
that are buried right there.

149
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,572
You sure you don't want to tell me
about this thing you shot?

150
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:14,941
- I get 100,000 hits a week on my blog.
-No, Karl.

151
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,538
You weren't really
out there hunting boar, were you?

152
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:21,084
- What?
-You're an O'Hara. Come on.

153
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,444
And what is that supposed to mean?

154
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,622
It's Pops O'Hara, the O'Hara legacy.

155
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,953
Okay, thanks, Karl.

156
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,120
Okay. I get it.

157
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,294
But if you change your mind
and you want to talk to me, call me,

158
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,356
'cause I'm texting you
my number right now.

159
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,494
- Great. Thanks, Karl.
-That was me on the phone.

160
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,801
Great. Who gave you my number?

161
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,067
Bye.

162
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:05,662
What the heck are you? No! No!

163
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,287
Top of the morning to you.

164
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,247
Wait, wait, wait. Hold it.

165
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:41,614
I love you, Karen,
but you can't come in here.

166
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,853
Your dad's gonna
shut the place down in a flash.

167
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,328
Come on. When I was 10, you let me
sit there and sing Oh, <i>Danny</i> Boy

168
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:49,332
for tourists with Pop.
You didn't have a problem with it then.

169
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,425
Sweetheart, that's commerce.

170
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,491
Son of a bitch.

171
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,771
I knew it. You're cheating me, 
old man!

172
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,000
Hey. What the hell is the matter with you?
You can't cheat at darts.

173
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,602
You can either throw the dart
in the bull's-eye, or you can't.

174
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,575
The only person who's ever 
cheated you was the guy upstairs.

175
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,406
He cheated you out of any brains.

176
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:07,711
Knock it off, both of you.

177
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,047
It's all right. I got it.

178
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,610
Hey, O'Haras don't hustle.
Get out.

179
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,014
Who the hell are you?

180
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:15,058
Someone who can have
the Sheriff here in two minutes.

181
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,353
Now leave.

182
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,190
You heard the lady.
Hit the bricks.

183
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,102
You're hustling dart games now?
That's a new low.

184
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:30,470
Just separating a fool from his gold.
You want to play?

185
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,700
Pop, I...

186
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,836
I have something 
I want to show you.

187
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,542
Do you know what that is?

188
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,717
Looked it up.

189
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,423
It says it's an ancient
curse from Ireland.

190
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,957
You pick a red four-leaf clover,
and you release an evil spirit.

191
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,862
If you don't get it in four days,
you're dead.

192
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,963
I picked one yesterday.

193
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,529
So, what do we do?

194
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,164
We're gonna need the luck 
of the Irish.

195
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:10,043
Luck of the Irish?
What the hell does that even mean?

196
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:15,577
You're always legends and fairy tales,
but now something really real comes along,

197
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:20,454
and all you've got is the luck of the Irish.
What's the end of this fairy tale?

198
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,254
I don't need luck of the Irish!
I need answers!

199
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:45,079
Well, Karen...

200
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:50,312
The burn on your 
hand is concerning,

201
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:54,187
but not nearly so much
as these blood work reports.

202
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,459
Why? What are they?

203
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:59,257
Your white blood cell count...
Through the roof.

204
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,259
And what does that mean?

205
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:05,467
It means your body is fighting off
a serious infection,

206
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,834
in this case, 
a potentially deadly one.

207
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:11,972
The strange thing is,
you don't have a fever.

208
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:14,469
The rest of your blood work
is completely normal.

209
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:18,478
Are you superstitious?

210
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,676
- Karen, this is serious.
-So am I.

211
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,218
What are you talking about?

212
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:25,583
I think I'm cursed.

213
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:31,852
Don't tell me. You've been
listening to your pops again.

214
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:35,455
Karen, you know the man is...

215
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:39,661
What? Go ahead. Say it. A drunk.
My pops is a crazy drunk.

216
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,068
Everybody says it. I know it.

217
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:46,766
Do you know I believed in unicorns
until I was 12 because of him?

218
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,512
And all his stories
about Keening Woods being haunted,

219
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:55,712
all the goblins and fairy folk,
I'm starting to think he's right.

220
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,784
- I'm cursed.
-Karen...

221
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:03,588
- Be rational.
-Why? It's an irrational world.

222
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:06,754
You want to put me in a hospital for
three days, run every test in the book?

223
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,161
I'll be dead on the fourth day.

224
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:11,523
No, thank you.

225
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,670
<i>Hey, Karen. Hi. Hey.</i>

226
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,641
<i>- Hey, Dax. What's up?
-Nothing.</i>

227
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:56,343
<i>You weren't in school today.</i>

228
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:59,177
<i>So, I got your calc homework
for you if you want.</i>

229
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,140
Thanks.

230
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,812
<i>Or, I can... 
You need anything?</i>

231
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,946
<i>I can... Do you need... 
I'll do whatever.</i>

232
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,821
<i>I... Or if you just 
want to talk.</i>

233
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:12,321
No, I'm fine, but thank you.

234
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:17,265
Dax, isn't that your closet door?

235
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:20,734
What? Yeah. Why?

236
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,094
Who's that?

237
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,706
Who's who?

238
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,268
That. Behind you.

239
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:32,308
Karen, that's not funny. You're freaking
me out a little bit, all right?

240
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,849
Dax, I'm not kidding.
You need to turn around.

241
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:34,906
There's something there.

242
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,544
<i>Okay, Karen, that's not funny.
You're freaking me out.</i>

243
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:40,749
<i>- Stop it, all right? Don't do that.
-No, Dax! Get out of there!</i>

244
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,850
I call you to check on you,
and you respond with some weird joke?

245
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:45,417
Dax, look out!

246
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,498
<i>Hey, sicky, I said I have your calc
homework if you want it.</i>

247
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,888
Good morning.

248
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,663
Good morning.

249
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,460
How are you feeling?

250
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,465
- Yeah? Better? Butter?
-Yeah.

251
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:34,408
Sweetheart, I want to ask you
a couple questions about the...

252
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:37,841
The thing that attacked you
in the woods the other day.

253
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,279
I want to know if you 
can describe it...

254
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:45,278
- That's plenty.
-...at all?

255
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:46,549
That's plenty of butter.

256
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:51,423
I don't know. It's hard. I...
I didn't really see it.

257
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:55,431
It's honey. 
I couldn't find the syrup.

258
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:58,661
- It's gonna take a little time.
-it's good.

259
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:02,398
Are we talking about
like a wild dog?

260
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,666
A bear?

261
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,265
Wolf?

262
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,704
A person?

263
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,074
You shot a person?

264
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,340
No, not a person.

265
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:14,544
It was covered in roots.
It came up out of the ground.

266
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:17,052
Look, it looked like
one of those old drawings

267
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:19,418
of the guys with the goat feet and...

268
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,518
I sound crazy. I know.

269
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:28,053
You just sound like
you're traumatized is all.

270
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,565
Eat your waffle.

271
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:33,535
What's going on?
What is it?

272
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:37,936
A person went missing
in Keening Woods yesterday.

273
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:41,808
I'm on my way out there
now to check it out.

274
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,777
You didn't shoot them, too,
 did you?

275
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:44,973
Dad.

276
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:50,117
The woods are off limits, all right?
Period.

277
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:52,678
You come home after school until we
find out what the hell this thing is.

278
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,348
All right.

279
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,358
- And eat the waffle.
-Go to work.

280
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:53,609
Come on, sicky.

281
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,480
Come get in the car.

282
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:16,628
Hey, Dax, thanks for giving me
my calc homework last night.

283
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,232
Sorry I was being so weird.

284
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:21,107
Yeah. No worries.

285
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:24,576
Hey, Karen,

286
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:27,815
I know you're not feeling too hot,
but would you want to come

287
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,716
and help us
with the float tonight after school?

288
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,482
Please?

289
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,887
I don't know.

290
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:39,621
Well, as St. Patrick's Day Parade Queen,
I could command you to do it,

291
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:43,258
but since you're not feeling too hot,
I'll just ask.

292
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:47,003
Yeah, I'll stop by for a little bit.

293
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,093
Awesome.

294
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:51,830
Me, too. I love decorating floats.

295
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:53,505
Cool.

296
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,544
Karen, you all right?

297
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:05,284
Let me out! Open the car doors!
Let me out now!

298
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:06,413
All right! All right!

299
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:08,957
Open the door right now!
I need to get out of the car!

300
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,549
Just open the door, please!

301
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,758
Where are you going?

302
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:13,989
Karen!

303
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:34,378
What is the matter with you?

304
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,112
Me? What is the matter with you?

305
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:41,214
Isn't it illegal to use your cop siren
thing to harass your little brother?

306
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,956
What? It's illegal to
read books in public now?

307
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:48,987
No. Don't be stupid.

308
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:50,464
What's wrong with you, huh?
Your phone broken?

309
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:52,296
No. Why?

310
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:53,768
Mom's been trying to call you
for three hours.

311
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:55,930
Well, Mom worries too much.

312
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:59,032
Yeah, I know, and you make it worse
because when she worries, she calls me,

313
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,077
and I have to drive all around town
looking for your ass...

314
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,511
Hey, search and seizure.
She doesn't have a warrant!

315
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,416
Just to tell you to put
your phone off mute.

316
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,917
All right. Sorry.

317
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,890
What are you reading?

318
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,668
<i>MILF?
What the hell?</i>

319
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:30,604
<i>It's Medieval Irish Legends
and Folklore.</i> M-I-L-F.

320
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,573
Why do you read
all this fantasy crap anyway?

321
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,272
I don't know.

322
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,212
I like reading the kind of crap where
guys like me actually get the princess.

323
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:39,441
You are the princess.

324
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,851
"Goblins, fairies, 
and mischief makers."

325
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:45,454
- I'm reading it for a friend.
-Yeah?

326
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:47,188
Yeah, Karen O'Hara.

327
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:52,693
The Sheriff's daughter.
Dax, my boss.

328
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,959
You're trying to seduce my boss' daughter
with goblins, fairies, and mischief makers?

329
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,899
I'm not trying to seduce anybody.
I'm...

330
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,328
She's in trouble.
Okay?

331
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:04,506
So, she's in trouble
with goblins,

332
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:07,338
and you're trying
to save her with fairies and magic?

333
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,802
At least I don't
have to worry about you seducing her.

334
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,908
Thanks, sis. That's nice. Great sister. 
Love you, too. The best.

335
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:19,820
<i>Unit 169, we've got a possible 382
on Old Forest Road in Keening Woods.</i>

336
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,684
Isn't that... Someone's gone missing?

337
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,325
Maybe. I got to go. Okay?

338
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,420
Yeah. Look who wants to be
the knight in shining armor now.

339
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:30,594
Very funny. Call Mom, smart-ass.

340
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:31,894
Call your mom.

341
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:35,062
That's your mom you're talking about.
Good luck with Karen.

342
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:09,300
Unit 214 checking in.
Who am I looking for, Carrie?

343
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,806
<i>Molly Morris called in 
again about Ian,</i>

344
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:14,241
<i>said he went missing on one
of his hunting trips yesterday.</i>

345
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,438
Yeah, well, I found his car.

346
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:24,648
Probably just drunk again.

347
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:28,017
<i>The Sheriff wants you
to check it out anyway.</i>

348
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,490
Copy that.

349
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:43,667
I hate Keening Woods.

350
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:12,025
Ian?

351
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,551
Oh, my God.

352
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:40,255
Carrie, get the Sheriff
out here right away.

353
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,360
Hey, Karen.

354
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:48,233
I wanted to come by and check on you,
make sure you're feeling...

355
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:51,330
- Are you all right?
-Yeah, you didn't have to do that.

356
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,636
I know.

357
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,337
Actually, I wanted to talk to you
about something, if that's all right?

358
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,073
Yeah. Yeah.

359
00:33:58,302 --> 00:33:59,838
It's...

360
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,216
What's that?

361
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,417
You don't remember drawing this?

362
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:09,987
Well, you did. Right before
you freaked out in the car.

363
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,691
This word, you know what it means?

364
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:18,199
I connected the letters like this.

365
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:24,502
L-U-C-H-O-R

366
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:27,934
P-A-I-N.

367
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:30,673
Luchorpain.

368
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,011
It's old Gaelic for leprechaun.

369
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,850
- How do you know all this?
-I know, right?

370
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:42,324
I'm the only kid in the world
who still uses the library.

371
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,853
Yeah. Well, then I must 
suck at drawing

372
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,329
because this doesn't look
anything like a leprechaun.

373
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:53,134
Well, not the kind that we're taught about.
But look at this.

374
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,499
It's the thing
that came at me in Keening Woods.

375
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,871
You must think I'm nuts.

376
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,175
No, I don't.

377
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,482
Well, then you're nuts 
for believing me.

378
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:10,018
Maybe.

379
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,621
Honey, it's a very nice drawing,
but what is it exactly?

380
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,697
A drawing of what came
at me in the woods.

381
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:25,963
It's what?

382
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:28,503
<i>Look, I know it sounds crazy,</i>

383
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:31,166
but I think it's a...
I can't believe I'm saying this.

384
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,401
I think it's a leprechaun.

385
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,671
All right. Sweetie, what are 
you saying now, okay?

386
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,505
I think Pop was right.

387
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:40,478
<i>Maybe there's some truth
to the old town legend about the settlers</i>

388
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,745
<i>bringing a leprechaun with them
from Ireland.</i>

389
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,787
Okay, that's great. 
But, honey, listen.

390
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:46,788
You and I both know
that Pop's not altogether there.

391
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:48,187
But I know what I saw.

392
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:51,989
I'm sure you do, but could we please just
talk about this later when I get home?

393
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,357
I'm in the middle of it right now.

394
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:57,258
- Okay. Bye, Dad.
-Bye.

395
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:09,274
You all right? What's the matter?

396
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,481
What's wrong?

397
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:21,181
- Get back in the car.
-I'm fine.

398
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:23,452
- Get out of here.
-I'm okay.

399
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:29,430
It's Stanley Howarth.

400
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:32,525
Looks like his body was dragged up
from his fishing spot.

401
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:37,300
Is that an animal attack?

402
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,706
We haven't had bears
in here for 60 years.

403
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,506
That ain't no boar.

404
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:45,905
- What's that?
-What?

405
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,984
Is that a goat?

406
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,984
Not unless it walked on two legs.

407
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,049
What?

408
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:00,823
Look at that track pattern.
It's a two-legged creature.

409
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,652
I'm sorry.

410
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:29,948
You all right?

411
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:34,856
What if I told you that I...

412
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,523
That I just saw a leprechaun?

413
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,689
Are you kidding me? I'd say, "What
the hell is wrong with you?"

414
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,736
Yeah, that's about right.

415
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:04,119
Leslie?

416
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:08,196
Leslie?

417
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:12,229
Leslie?

418
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:35,788
Leslie?

419
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,629
Are you eating something?

420
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,843
Hello?

421
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:04,976
Hello!

422
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:11,222
Is somebody there?

423
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,974
Not enough that you never pay me.
Now you're stealing stuff?

424
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:11,485
Give me a break, Hap.
This thing is bigger than the both of us.

425
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:14,045
I should call your son,
have him throw you in the tank.

426
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:16,284
Wouldn't be the first time, would it?

427
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:20,595
You stealing my lucky horseshoe
to fight another leprechaun, are you?

428
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:23,962
Kiss my Johnny Belinda, Wally.
And I have even started drinking today.

429
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,227
That's what I'm afraid of.

430
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,101
Bring it back when you're done.

431
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:43,308
Hey, Jen.

432
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:47,582
- Not now, Karl.
-What? Jeez. All I said was hi.

433
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,682
We're working here.
You got any questions, ask Sheriff O'Hara.

434
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,055
I did. He sent me to you.

435
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,152
- I don't know anything.
-That's probably why he sent me to you.

436
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:55,788
- Knock it off, Karl.
-Can I get a quote?

437
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:57,127
Remember the last time
I gave you a quote?

438
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,759
Yeah, when the tornado brought the
sharks to the lake, sharknado.

439
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:02,159
It took me two years to live
that stupid headline down.

440
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,563
I see his cufflinks were ripped off.

441
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,942
Very astute of you, Karl.
You should have been a cop.

442
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:08,567
So should you.

443
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,077
- Shut up.
-You shut up.

444
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,772
The cufflinks were gold.
Perp ran off with them.

445
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,042
That's all I'm giving you.

446
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:15,083
Right. The cufflink bandit.
That's probably what happened.

447
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,243
Excuse me?

448
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,786
No, no. It's just, I'm
sure you're well aware

449
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,913
of the case of this happening in town
many years ago.

450
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,650
Spit it out, Karl.
What are you trying to tell me?

451
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:25,125
1874,14 people were
murdered in Keening,

452
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,560
and gold was taken
straight from the victims' bodies.

453
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:29,364
You telling me this is 
a copycat murder?

454
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,627
Or a supernatural creature.

455
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:35,059
You know the Keening leprechaun
was reputed to have eaten gold

456
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:36,798
to heal itself and get stronger?

457
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,004
I can't believe
I'm standing here listening to you.

458
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:42,169
What is wrong with me?
Get out of here. Go.

459
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:43,644
There's someone or something
out there offing people,

460
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,203
and I've got the right to report it.

461
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,907
Look, we don't know
who's doing this, okay?

462
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:48,712
Or what.

463
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:50,080
The last thing the
people of Keening need

464
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,380
is your boogeyman crap
in the paper right now...

465
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:53,683
- Or online.
-Or online.

466
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,690
So I take it
that's a "no comment" from the police?

467
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,248
Bite me, Karl.

468
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:58,588
I'm gonna quote you on that.

469
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:01,596
Good.
Just make sure you spell my name right.

470
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:53,142
Oh. my God!

471
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:20,772
They gave you the nice cubicle.

472
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,377
Change your mind about giving me
the story on your strange creature?

473
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:25,478
No, I just wanted a few answers.

474
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,148
Join the club.

475
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:28,740
People are dropping
like flies around here,

476
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:31,616
and your dad and his team are about
as tight-lipped as a mime with tetanus.

477
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:33,887
"A mime with tetanus"?
That's the best you could come up with?

478
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:36,151
You want to talk about this thing
or bag on my metaphors?

479
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:37,214
Similes.

480
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,885
- Sit down.
-Fine.

481
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:44,422
Tell me what you saw,
and I'll give you everything I got.

482
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:47,266
I think I shot a leprechaun.

483
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:49,337
I knew it!

484
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:53,603
I knew there was something to that...
That whole legend. Did you...

485
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:54,768
You didn't kill it, though, did you?

486
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,000
No.

487
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,345
Did you get a good look at it?

488
00:43:58,402 --> 00:43:59,938
Not really,
but I got this.

489
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:03,178
And I got this.

490
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,246
It's the Curse of the Red Clover.

491
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,550
Yeah.

492
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,120
So, how do I beat this?

493
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:12,857
You're gonna have to
face the leprechaun yourself.

494
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:13,986
How?

495
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:15,986
I don't know.

496
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:17,656
Well, Karl, what do you mean "face it"?

497
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:20,565
You mean fight it, kill it,
beat it at a game of chess?

498
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,798
The legend is incomplete. I don't know.
Talk to Pops. What does he know?

499
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,406
Same as you, just drunk.

500
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:26,805
I wish I knew more.

501
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:31,508
Me, too. Well, thanks anyway, Karl.

502
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,639
And by the way, I don't want
to see this in your newspaper.

503
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:35,782
- Or my blog.
-That, too.

504
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:18,217
Hello, Pulitzer.

505
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,500
Here. leppy. leppy. leppy.

506
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:35,274
Got some yummy gold for you.
Yum, yum, yum.

507
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:48,083
Nice.

508
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:46,445
Okay, more to your right.

509
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:48,575
Your other right.

510
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:54,545
Okay.

511
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:57,592
Hey, what about this?

512
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,683
Really?

513
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,791
Come on, honey.

514
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:02,762
It's been in the family for generations.

515
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,694
It's lucky.

516
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:06,792
It wasn't lucky for Grandpa McHenry.

517
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,761
Well, sure it was.

518
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,467
Everyone got out of the fire okay,
didn't they?

519
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:14,308
I don't know, Mom.

520
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:16,605
I want my throne to be
beautiful, not that.

521
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:20,005
Hey, lucky is lucky.

522
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,314
And it's like your grandpa always said,

523
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:27,048
"There's no use fearing the wind
if your haystacks are tied down."

524
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,819
But okay. Suit yourself.

525
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:34,859
Hey, Karen, how are you feeling?

526
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,087
Do you want to help us
finish up the float?

527
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:39,828
No, I just wanted to stop by and say hi

528
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:43,497
and sorry for freaking out
in the car this morning.

529
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:46,065
You're going crazy. It's cool.

530
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,773
I'm gonna go home and get some rest.

531
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:50,402
All right. Feel better.

532
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:54,313
Okay. Here we go.
Now take good care of this.

533
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:57,511
All the parade queens
have worn it before you.

534
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:59,178
Lined with gold.

535
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:03,023
I hereby pardon you.

536
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,319
But for real, feel better.

537
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,192
Stop by later if you want.

538
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:11,233
I'd love to, but I already promised
my two favorite subjects

539
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:14,064
that I'd hang out with them
after they finish my throne.

540
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:18,006
I can walk you home.

541
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,540
I mean, if you want.

542
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:22,302
Okay.

543
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,801
Son of a bitch.

544
00:48:57,401 --> 00:49:01,372
I just wanted to say thank you
for everything today.

545
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:05,452
Yeah. I just don't like to
see anybody upset.

546
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:08,285
So it's not me?
It's the situation?

547
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:12,519
No. No, it's you.

548
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:17,061
Come on. You know I've liked
you since fifth grade.

549
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:19,389
It's pathetic. I know.

550
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,494
What? No, it's not pathetic.

551
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:23,765
You don't think it's pathetic

552
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:26,467
that it took you being attacked
by a mythical creature

553
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:28,472
for me to man up and talk to you?

554
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:30,643
Fifth grade, though? Seriously?

555
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:32,647
Yeah. You don't remember?

556
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:35,912
You kicked Evan Shardoff's ass
when he was picking on me.

557
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,018
Pop was teaching me
how to box that summer.

558
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:41,182
You are the best.

559
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:46,625
Who the hell is that?

560
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,224
Come on!

561
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,584
- Is that the horseshoe from our mailbox?
-Yeah.

562
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:17,955
That's two. Come on. Get in the house.
Get in the house.

563
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:29,901
I always thought leprechauns were nice
little guys in green with pots of gold.

564
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,300
Yeah, in fairy tales maybe,

565
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:36,401
but in the real world, they're the
vermin of all the fairy folk.

566
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,105
There's other fairy folk?
There's other fairy folk.

567
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:45,510
How do you think this town,
founded by a bunch of Irish immigrants,

568
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:47,282
did as well as it did?

569
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:49,517
Because of the gold
mine in Keening Gorge.

570
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:52,685
How do you strike a gold mine in a state
that doesn't have any gold veins?

571
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:57,762
They captured a leprechaun
in the old country

572
00:50:57,821 --> 00:51:00,802
and then they brought it over with them
when they settled here.

573
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:02,234
Everyone knows that story.

574
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:03,771
Yeah, they got its pot of gold, right?

575
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:05,238
No.

576
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:10,404
They drained the luck out of it
up at the old gold refinery.

577
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:13,880
They turned it mean and vicious,
and then it turned on them and escaped.

578
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:17,515
That's when they hired your
great-great-great-grandfather, Elias,

579
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:18,848
to hunt it down.

580
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,980
It doesn't sound like
he did a very good job.

581
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:22,421
He did a great job.

582
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:25,790
He buried it in the woods
according to Irish legend.

583
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:28,989
Four horseshoes bound
the leprechaun in place.

584
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:31,191
They were mounted on compass points.

585
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,131
North, south, east, and
west of the grave.

586
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:34,396
So, who moved them?

587
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:40,607
Well, that fire at McHenry's
bed and breakfast dislodged one of them,

588
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:43,372
and that's when the red clover bloomed.

589
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:50,779
It's not a boar tooth
on your neck, is it?

590
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,955
No, this was passed down
from generation to generation by Elias.

591
00:51:57,814 --> 00:52:01,261
In case the town forgot,
the O'Haras never would.

592
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:04,259
So, he buried it in the woods?
That's all we've got to do?

593
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:05,766
No, that's not all we got to do.

594
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:07,199
We got to find the four horseshoes,

595
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:10,067
and then we've got to use
the four horseshoes against him.

596
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:11,538
We've already got one.

597
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:17,011
We got two, and they're like
crucifixes to a vampire.

598
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:18,375
They hate them.

599
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:20,446
Yeah, I figured that out.

600
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:21,676
Where are the others?

601
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:25,146
Well, I think one is at the brewery,
and then the other one is at the fire,

602
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:26,710
but it's gone missing.

603
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,720
- Then let's go to the brewery.
-No, I'll get the horseshoes.

604
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:31,554
What you two need to do
is go through the books

605
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:35,119
and figure out how to attach them
together, so we can lift the curse.

606
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:38,933
Hey, Pop, when we kill that thing,

607
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,266
I get its tooth.

608
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:44,168
Deal. I'm gonna get one
for you, too, squirt.

609
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:54,347
Check this out.

610
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,175
- What the hell is that?
-That is blood.

611
00:52:58,241 --> 00:52:59,845
Green blood? From what?

612
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:03,781
Exactly. Why don't you get
in there, get a sample?

613
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,327
Yeah, I'll leave that to Forensics.

614
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:08,760
It looks like whatever this thing was,

615
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:10,923
it was hiding in the dumpster
when it was wounded.

616
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:13,328
Sounds like my father.

617
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:18,028
Why don't you keep it together, boss?
There's a crime scene right there.

618
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:21,302
It looks like Happy was taking out the
trash when this thing jumped out.

619
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:24,607
Did we ever get those lab reports
on those prints back from the lake?

620
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:27,078
Yeah, e-mailed Boston College Zoology.

621
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:30,209
They said
there's no such hoof in the database.

622
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,251
There's what?

623
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:35,590
There's no such hoof in the database.
Come on. Hoof!

624
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:36,919
- What?
-There's no such hoof.

625
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,584
Hoof. And forget your troubles.

626
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:40,559
Come on. Get happy.

627
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:44,428
You know it gets weirder in there.

628
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:47,532
See what I mean?

629
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:50,504
Yeah. That's weird.

630
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,800
Should I...

631
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:55,472
Be scared to ask what sort of animal
bleeds dark green,

632
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:58,172
rifles through a coin case,
and only takes the gold coins?

633
00:53:58,735 --> 00:53:59,770
Yeah.

634
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:00,837
Yeah, I thought so.

635
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:04,374
Want to hear a weirder question?
What eats gold coins?

636
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:06,210
<i>- Sheriff, copy?
-Yeah?</i>

637
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:09,647
<i>We have a disturbance over on...
Conor, you know, the road by your house.</i>

638
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:10,851
What?

639
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,951
<i>Witnesses say they heard
a couple of kids screaming,</i>

640
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:15,792
<i>then a shotgun being fired
by someone in an old Mustang.</i>

641
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:18,662
That'll be right. All right. 
We're on it.

642
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:30,141
Hello?

643
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:34,341
Your majesty. Got you.

644
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:35,883
I'm not that fat!

645
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,691
You realize we're not gonna find any beer.
This place has been shut down for years.

646
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:56,760
Yeah, but Happy O'Shannon
is using it

647
00:54:56,826 --> 00:55:00,433
to store a whole room full of
gold-leaf green beer for the parade.

648
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:04,168
This is not
what I thought you meant we were doing

649
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:07,807
when I offered to hang out
with you guys tonight.

650
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:11,215
I thought we'd do something, you know,
fun.

651
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:13,148
With me.

652
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,115
I don't even like drinking.

653
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:18,988
Yeah, but you're the
one with a car.

654
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:21,495
Shut up.
F him.

655
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:23,728
Seriously?

656
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:51,756
What do you want?
Didn't recognize the car?

657
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:53,659
I got half a dozen calls saying

658
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:56,789
shotgun blasts were heard
in front of our house, Pop.

659
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,224
Is that so?

660
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:00,458
Cut the crap. Where are you going?

661
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,361
I'm going to the brewery.

662
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:05,497
Why?

663
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,968
Give me the gun.

664
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:14,844
I got a lot more guns.

665
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:17,942
I know you do.
Where do you think you got them?

666
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:20,317
- What are you shooting at?
-I didn't get a good look at it.

667
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:24,519
No? Really? Well, I did.
What's a leprechaun doing in my town, Pop?

668
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:31,325
Karen picked the red clover
and released it accidentally.

669
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,924
Now she's cursed.

670
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:34,491
What do you mean she's been cursed?

671
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:36,764
Give me the gun back.
I'll get it.

672
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,167
She's got two days.

673
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:42,972
All we have to do is get it and get it
buried by then, and she'll be okay.

674
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:44,272
All right. That's all
well and good, all right?

675
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:46,712
But there's protocol, Pop.
I've got to call for backup here.

676
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:47,976
I get your backup.

677
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:51,114
You're in this alone, Conor.
What are you gonna tell your men?

678
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:55,554
That you're a lepre-cop,
hunting leprechauns?

679
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:57,717
You'll be the town joke,
just like me.

680
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:01,460
Face it, pal.
You're in this alone with your dad.

681
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:04,891
Yeah? Well, fine. All right?

682
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:09,298
But we're taking my car.
Step away from the vehicle.

683
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,680
Hey, check this out.

684
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:24,478
- He's called the Green Man.
-Green Man?

685
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:27,354
Yeah, he's an earth creature.

686
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:32,917
A lot of these creatures from Irish
folklore, they have different names,

687
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:35,690
but they're essentially the same.

688
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:37,493
Wait. Look at this.

689
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:43,230
You see where they stab him?
Look at this.

690
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:46,598
See how he heals up?

691
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,966
But wait. Check this out.

692
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,577
Here.

693
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:02,579
Look familiar?

694
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:07,055
We're gonna need that fourth horseshoe.

695
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:13,196
- Nice.
-And you didn't believe us.

696
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:16,036
Nope. Just didn't care.
Seen beer before.

697
00:58:16,062 --> 00:58:17,252
Have fun, losers.

698
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:21,269
Dude, check this out.
Did you see those gold flecks?

699
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,208
- Yeah, it's awesome.
-That is crazy.

700
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:41,929
Ben! You all right? Ben...

701
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:44,524
Ben!

702
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:48,330
What are you doing?
What happened? Ben?

703
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:43,552
Why are we going to the brewery?

704
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:46,327
To get the third horseshoe.

705
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:48,461
Where'd the leprechaun go?

706
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,323
I don't know.

707
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:54,360
- What does it want?
-I have no idea what it wants.

708
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,700
Well, how do you stop it?

709
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,373
You should be ashamed
of yourself, Conor.

710
00:59:58,399 --> 00:59:59,628
Ashamed of myself? For what?

711
00:59:59,662 --> 01:00:01,505
For not knowing your
family history.

712
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:04,571
Up until yesterday, when I came
face to face with the damned thing,

713
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:06,772
I thought all this leprechaun stuff
was a bunch of malarkey.

714
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:10,181
But now, I'm with the program here, Pop,
and you are not telling me anything.

715
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:11,547
So tell me, how do we kill it?

716
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:15,784
You can't kill fairy folk, son.
They're immortal.

717
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:18,724
- They're immortal? I should've known.
-Yeah. Don't be a wise ass.

718
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,193
How do we get rid of this thing?

719
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,287
- First, we find the four horseshoes.
-Okay.

720
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:27,330
And we put them together
in some kind of ancient configuration,

721
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:31,270
and it's supposed to stun the leprechaun.
I don't know.

722
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:35,070
Karen and what's-his-face
are looking it up on the Internet.

723
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:39,977
It's not like I do this
every day, Conor.

724
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:54,152
You Okay?

725
01:00:54,884 --> 01:00:57,194
You mean
other than the ancient death curse,

726
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:58,891
and having to fight
a nature demon

727
01:00:58,955 --> 01:01:00,457
when I don't know
what I'm supposed to be doing,

728
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:02,503
or you mean having a father

729
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:04,538
who's completely oblivious
to my blossoming womanhood

730
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:07,336
and trying to stifle my personal growth
because he can't let go?

731
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:11,436
Or maybe because my pops, the town drunk
who believes in goblins and fairies,

732
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:15,415
has actually turned out to be the one
who's completely right this entire time?

733
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:17,246
Life's a bitch, huh?

734
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:20,783
Sorry.

735
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:23,187
No. I'm sorry.
It was a dumb question.

736
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:25,988
No, it wasn't. It's just...

737
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:30,560
Who gets haunted by a leprechaun?
What is that?

738
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:33,396
It's the stupidest thing I've ever
heard of, and it's happening to me.

739
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:38,804
It's like I'm trapped in some
bad monster movie and can't get out.

740
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:41,603
And to top it off, this thing's
probably just gonna kill me anyway.

741
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:43,701
Hey, it's not gonna kill you.

742
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:47,441
If this was a bad monster movie,
it would kill everybody, but you.

743
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:49,676
Small consolation.

744
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:52,686
When somebody gets you down,
it takes 42 muscles to frown,

745
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:56,884
but it only takes two muscles
if you reach out and pimp-slap them.

746
01:01:56,946 --> 01:02:00,758
Are you suggesting
that I pimp-slap the leprechaun?

747
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:03,093
Yes. Yes, I am.

748
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,126
But you don't have to do it alone,

749
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:07,532
because I'm gonna be there
to pimp-slap the leprechaun with you.

750
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:12,130
It'll be like a double
pimp-slap deal, like...

751
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:20,176
Okay, I'm done talking. You talk.
You're better at it than me.

752
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:24,112
You and I make a pretty good team.

753
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:25,914
Yeah? You think so?

754
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:27,782
Yeah.

755
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:36,857
<i>Wood.</i>

756
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:39,700
What?

757
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:42,168
I mean a branch, a staff.

758
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:47,474
A branch, staff for the horseshoes,
for the pimp-slap.

759
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:50,170
And kissing me made you think of that?

760
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:52,977
No.

761
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:02,351
Give me that hammer.

762
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:07,360
Hey, remember when you were eight,
we went leprechaun hunting?

763
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:10,295
How could I forget?
I broke my arm that year.

764
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:11,593
You survived.

765
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,399
Now you wonder why
I don't want you taking Karen hunting.

766
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:18,302
She's more capable than you think.

767
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:21,567
And she's a lot less capable
than you think, Pop.

768
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:26,537
I was disappointed
we never found a leprechaun.

769
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:35,547
Well, Merry Christmas, son.

770
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:38,216
There's one now.

771
01:05:32,795 --> 01:05:36,709
O'Hara, radio. Got a 1031 at
the Silver Shamrock Brewery.

772
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,302
We need backup units and EMS.

773
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:45,277
This is not good.

774
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:21,482
There's another one.

775
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:30,626
Unbelievable.

776
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:32,792
Look at that thing.

777
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:51,048
- What's that?
- It's bait.

778
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:53,546
Look at him move.

779
01:06:56,612 --> 01:06:57,682
It's eating it.

780
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:14,704
Dad!

781
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:17,034
What are you doing?

782
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:49,808
Hello?

783
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,571
You all right?

784
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,519
Amanda?

785
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:04,618
Sheriff O'Hara, honey. It's Karen's dad.
Sweetie, it's...

786
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:14,500
All right. Let's get her out of here.
Get home safe.

787
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:30,342
Girl's not doing good,
keeps saying it was a monster.

788
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:34,050
- What the hell did you see in there?
-A leprechaun.

789
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,716
Lock it up for me, would you? Just...

790
01:08:39,882 --> 01:08:42,453
It's long gone, son.

791
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:45,863
So how did you know
that sucker back there ate gold?

792
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:49,164
Well, I'm an O'Hara, Pop.
I'm smart like that.

793
01:08:56,899 --> 01:09:01,348
The book says that the staff has to be
made out of oak, so this should work...

794
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:03,709
What?

795
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:11,985
Hey, you're gonna be all right. Okay?
You're not alone.

796
01:09:13,215 --> 01:09:14,387
He's right.

797
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:17,189
You're not alone.

798
01:09:18,521 --> 01:09:20,694
How are we gonna catch this thing?

799
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:23,532
There's only one person
I can think of who can help.

800
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:24,832
Who?

801
01:09:26,795 --> 01:09:28,399
Who do you think?

802
01:09:37,139 --> 01:09:39,779
All right.
So what do we know about this thing?

803
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,084
Well, if we had the fourth horseshoe,

804
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:48,094
we could use the four-leaf cleaver
long enough to bag it and bury it.

805
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:50,790
Otherwise, not so much.

806
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,855
Well, we're as ready as we can be.

807
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:57,000
Don't fear the wind
if your haystacks are tied down.

808
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:01,602
Wait. What did you just say?

809
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:06,201
- We're as ready as we can be.
-No, no. The other thing.

810
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:12,249
Don't fear the wind
if your haystacks are tied down?

811
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:15,848
I know where the fourth horseshoe is.

812
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:27,296
Okay. You look beautiful.

813
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:32,062
Hey. You know you don't have to do this.

814
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:34,630
Everyone would understand.

815
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:40,438
I know, but I think I need
it, and the town needs it.

816
01:10:40,836 --> 01:10:42,144
Amanda.

817
01:10:44,373 --> 01:10:47,047
Hey, Mom, do you still
have that horseshoe?

818
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:50,181
I think I could use some family luck.

819
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:17,946
Thanks, Mom.

820
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:53,547
Bye, Mom.

821
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:56,417
I love you, honey.

822
01:12:33,148 --> 01:12:36,027
- What's this?
-I don't know.

823
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:51,168
What are you doing here?
I just called it in.

824
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:53,144
What are you talking about?

825
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:54,875
It's Mrs. McHenry.

826
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:03,181
Dad.

827
01:13:04,947 --> 01:13:06,324
The parade.

828
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:52,128
Out of the way.

829
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:14,318
Jen!

830
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:57,034
Get out of here!

831
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:27,131
You all right?

832
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:28,395
I'm fine.

833
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:37,401
Is that thing dead? Are you all right?

834
01:15:37,466 --> 01:15:39,810
-It's stunned.
-Fine. I'm fine.

835
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:42,178
- How's the kid?
-What's-his-face is dead.

836
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:44,712
What's-his-face?

837
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:46,346
He's dead?

838
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,285
Pop!

839
01:15:54,349 --> 01:15:57,558
Where are you going? What are you doing?

840
01:15:58,554 --> 01:15:59,726
That's not a souvenir!

841
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:03,194
See ya!

842
01:16:03,592 --> 01:16:05,868
- He's taking it to Keening Woods.
-What?

843
01:16:05,928 --> 01:16:07,771
That's where you bury monsters.

844
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:21,854
Fatality behind Malone's
Market in the alley.

845
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:24,653
The animal has been captured.

846
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:29,355
It's being transported
in a 1967 green Mustang.

847
01:16:29,685 --> 01:16:31,255
Proceed with caution. Out of...
What are you...

848
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:32,355
No, let's go.

849
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:34,298
No "let's go." Out.
You're weak. You're tired.

850
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:36,393
Honey, you got a cut.
You probably need stitches.

851
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:38,836
I am fine. I do not need stitches.
Let's go.

852
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:41,170
No. What kind of father do you think I am?
Get out of the car.

853
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:45,006
You always think Pop is crazy
and dangerous, but you know what?

854
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:46,842
He let me shoot a gun when I was 10.

855
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:49,382
He let me climb Monroe Rock
without a rope when I was 11.

856
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:50,815
When I was 12, I was driving his truck.

857
01:16:50,872 --> 01:16:53,876
And you know that boar
he tells everybody he took down? Bessie?

858
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:55,319
That was me.

859
01:16:55,377 --> 01:16:56,913
He said he did that.

860
01:16:56,979 --> 01:16:59,892
Yeah. Well, he was
afraid you'd be worried.

861
01:17:00,582 --> 01:17:01,686
I...

862
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:05,095
Look, Pop taught me how to be strong.

863
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:07,895
But you taught me how to be smart.

864
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:09,299
Dad, please.

865
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:13,767
"Dad." Put on your seat belt.

866
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:16,759
Wait, Karen, before we go out there,

867
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:19,932
I just want you to know

868
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:23,943
that you've demonstrated
incredible moral fiber

869
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:27,674
and great courage, and I'm proud of you.

870
01:18:29,838 --> 01:18:31,340
I know I've treated you
like a little girl,

871
01:18:31,406 --> 01:18:36,321
and I've been way too overprotective
since we lost your mother.

872
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:41,417
I just want you to know
that you'll always be my baby,

873
01:18:41,483 --> 01:18:44,726
but you are no little girl.

874
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:50,194
Tell me what happened to her. To Mom.

875
01:18:52,027 --> 01:18:54,564
You said it yourself.
I'm not a little girl anymore.

876
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:56,438
What happened to her?

877
01:18:56,965 --> 01:18:58,740
You were very young.

878
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:08,377
It was Black Friday,
the busiest shopping day of the year.

879
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:13,059
And we left you with Pop,

880
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:17,427
so your mother and I could buy you

881
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:21,332
a game console below retail cost.

882
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:23,826
It was an incredible value.

883
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:25,394
Dad, what happened to her?

884
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:27,599
Honey, there were
just so many people, all right?

885
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:32,839
I was fighting a woman and her son
for the last unit, and

886
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:35,745
the crowd surged,

887
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:38,741
and I lost her.

888
01:19:39,574 --> 01:19:40,848
You what?

889
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:44,457
I couldn't find her.

890
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:47,255
I went to the lost-and-found,
and there was nothing.

891
01:19:47,315 --> 01:19:51,525
I paged her every day for a year.

892
01:19:55,957 --> 01:20:00,269
What good am I? I am a...
I'm a terrible husband.

893
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:04,504
I'm a real awful father,
and I am a really bad sheriff.

894
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:09,743
The whole town is dead,
and I can't even find my wife,

895
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:13,086
let alone catch a leprechaun, and...

896
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:18,316
Even a letter on my name tag is missing.
Who's Coner?

897
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:21,286
I'm Conor. How does that happen?

898
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:22,350
I don't know, Dad.

899
01:20:23,518 --> 01:20:25,828
If anyone should be dead out there
right now...

900
01:20:27,055 --> 01:20:29,035
Dad! No! Dad!

901
01:20:30,258 --> 01:20:31,601
Dad!

902
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,143
Oh, my God.

903
01:21:59,314 --> 01:22:00,384
I'm sorry.

904
01:22:01,683 --> 01:22:04,061
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

905
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:05,962
I should have waited for you two.

906
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:08,964
Where's your old man?

907
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:11,295
He's gone.

908
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:14,204
He's gone.

909
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:17,141
You need to come with me, okay?

910
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:19,105
I'm not going anywhere.

911
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:21,841
You need to save your ass
from that leprechaun.

912
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:25,818
That old gold refinery
is right down the road.

913
01:22:25,874 --> 01:22:30,118
You got to get him before
he gets there and heals himself.

914
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:34,017
You've got to come with me.
I'm not leaving you here.

915
01:22:34,082 --> 01:22:38,189
I'm not going anywhere. Here. Take this.

916
01:22:39,721 --> 01:22:42,964
It's good luck most of the time.

917
01:22:43,491 --> 01:22:44,697
I can't take this.

918
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,436
Pop, I can't take this from you.

919
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:49,033
Pop.

920
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:51,237
Go on.

921
01:22:52,734 --> 01:22:53,804
Pop.

922
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:56,944
Pop.

923
01:24:40,842 --> 01:24:41,843
Hey, leppy.

924
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:45,919
Happy St. Patrick's Day.

925
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:17,915
Nice.
