00:00:18,942 --> 00:00:21,945
(crickets chirping)

3
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:07,624
(people chattering)

4
00:01:12,663 --> 00:01:15,900
[Kid] This is the
house I grew up in.

5
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:22,404
That's our sailboat
we never use.

6
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:25,309
My dad calls it
the Spirit Breaker.

7
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:34,416
That's Flake's house.

8
00:01:34,418 --> 00:01:36,086
He's my best friend.

9
00:01:38,255 --> 00:01:41,756
That's where I broke my
wrist when I was eight.

10
00:01:41,758 --> 00:01:45,662
And the pole Flake and
I carved our names into.

11
00:01:48,332 --> 00:01:50,735
This is our school.

12
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:58,109
That's my locker I
can never get open.

13
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:02,977
I lay in bed at night terrorized
by thoughts of this place

14
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:04,915
to where I can't sleep.

15
00:02:05,848 --> 00:02:07,215
And if I ever do get to sleep,

16
00:02:07,217 --> 00:02:09,354
I just have nightmares about it.

17
00:02:10,553 --> 00:02:13,624
Everyone's in a group or
wants to be in a group.

18
00:02:13,626 --> 00:02:15,389
It's a joke.

19
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:16,991
This place, and everyone in it,

20
00:02:16,993 --> 00:02:19,527
is a big shit pile
floating downstream.

21
00:02:19,529 --> 00:02:20,829
And all the way at the bottom,

22
00:02:20,831 --> 00:02:23,164
below the kids with
missing jaws and shit,

23
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,334
there's me and Flake.

24
00:02:25,336 --> 00:02:27,202
Ours is a group of two.

25
00:02:27,204 --> 00:02:28,971
(dramatic violin music)

26
00:02:28,973 --> 00:02:31,809
(kids chattering)

27
00:03:12,248 --> 00:03:15,819
(locker handle clattering)

28
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,419
(bell ringing)

29
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:20,021
[Woman On PA] We know it's
only the first day of school,

30
00:03:20,023 --> 00:03:23,025
but we want to encourage everyone
to meet in the quad today

31
00:03:23,027 --> 00:03:25,960
where you can sign up
for chess club, art club,

32
00:03:25,962 --> 00:03:29,830
thespian club, yearbook
club, drama club,

33
00:03:29,832 --> 00:03:31,568
video journalism club...

34
00:03:32,302 --> 00:03:34,906
(kids chattering)

35
00:03:52,156 --> 00:03:54,391
Edwin, where's your book?

36
00:03:55,325 --> 00:03:56,758
In my locker.

37
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,495
Well, what good is
it doing you in there?

38
00:04:00,497 --> 00:04:02,166
Sometimes I wonder.

39
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:04,966
Did you hear me?

40
00:04:04,968 --> 00:04:07,538
What's it doing in your locker?

41
00:04:09,573 --> 00:04:10,972
Well, do you want to
explain to the principal

42
00:04:10,974 --> 00:04:12,973
why it's there?

43
00:04:12,975 --> 00:04:14,408
[Kid] He can't
get his locker open.

44
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,143
(kids laugh)

45
00:04:16,145 --> 00:04:16,980
Shh.

46
00:04:18,282 --> 00:04:19,416
Is that true?

47
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,385
Is that really true?

48
00:04:23,387 --> 00:04:24,555
Oh, fuck me.

49
00:04:32,296 --> 00:04:36,467
So, Ms. Meier says you're
not to come back into her class

50
00:04:38,135 --> 00:04:42,307
until you're ready to start
acting like a human being.

51
00:04:43,173 --> 00:04:44,909
Do you know when that'll be?

52
00:04:49,546 --> 00:04:52,179
You want to tell me
what happened today?

53
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:54,851
I couldn't get my locker open.

54
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,886
You couldn't get
your locker open?

55
00:04:58,888 --> 00:05:01,289
Why does everyone
repeat what I say?

56
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,825
[Principal] Okay, and I
suppose you found it appropriate

57
00:05:03,827 --> 00:05:06,695
to use foul language
in her class

58
00:05:06,697 --> 00:05:08,028
'cause you couldn't
get your locker open?

59
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:08,864
Is that right?

60
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:10,534
You suppose right.

61
00:05:12,936 --> 00:05:17,108
All right, just tell your
parents I'm gonna be in touch.

62
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:22,847
Do you hear me?

63
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,381
I may keep it a surprise.

64
00:05:26,383 --> 00:05:27,484
Oh, my god.

65
00:05:28,851 --> 00:05:30,352
Kids like you used to
get their butts kicked

66
00:05:30,354 --> 00:05:31,755
when I was a kid.

67
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:33,957
They still do.

68
00:05:35,892 --> 00:05:37,124
All right.

69
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:39,896
Can we see less of
each other, please?

70
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:44,265
My mom checks the summer
reading thing that we had to do

71
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:45,200
and she looks over and she says,

72
00:05:45,202 --> 00:05:46,434
"Oh, this isn't good enough".

73
00:05:46,436 --> 00:05:47,869
So, she's making me
redo the entire thing

74
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:49,270
before we have to
hand it in tomorrow.

75
00:05:49,272 --> 00:05:50,905
It's so fucking stupid.

76
00:05:50,907 --> 00:05:52,873
She's always on
my case about it.

77
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,609
She just won't shut up for
the rest of the period.

78
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:57,714
And then, in the hallway
after class she's like...

79
00:06:00,717 --> 00:06:01,519
Ball.

80
00:06:08,825 --> 00:06:10,424
Come on.

81
00:06:10,426 --> 00:06:11,595
What the fuck?

82
00:06:15,498 --> 00:06:16,765
What's up now, bitch?

83
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:18,299
[Flake] Get off me.

84
00:06:18,301 --> 00:06:19,770
[Edwin] Get off him.

85
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:20,972
Oh, fuck!

86
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,939
[Kid] Think you're funny now?

87
00:06:24,941 --> 00:06:27,577
Where you going?
Where you going?

88
00:06:29,078 --> 00:06:30,111
What are you gonna do?

89
00:06:30,113 --> 00:06:30,946
Look at you.

90
00:06:30,948 --> 00:06:31,780
[Flake] Get off of me.

91
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:33,049
Get off.

92
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:34,715
[Kid] You're such a bitch.

93
00:06:34,717 --> 00:06:35,383
[Flake] Fuck you.

94
00:06:35,385 --> 00:06:36,350
[Kid] Fuck me?

95
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:37,187
- Okay.
- Fuck you.

96
00:06:37,787 --> 00:06:39,087
(grunting)

97
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:40,155
[Coach] Hey, hey, hey, hey!

98
00:06:40,157 --> 00:06:41,857
Knock it off!

99
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,458
Hey, knock it off!

100
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,458
I'm gonna kill you.

101
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,760
What are you gonna do?

102
00:06:45,762 --> 00:06:48,429
[Coach] I said knock
it off right now!

103
00:06:48,431 --> 00:06:49,931
Hey, hey, knock it off.

104
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:51,499
Knock it off. Get off him.

105
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:53,200
Get off him!

106
00:06:53,202 --> 00:06:54,970
What is wrong with you?

107
00:06:54,972 --> 00:06:55,806
Go.

108
00:06:58,075 --> 00:07:00,344
(groaning)

109
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:04,044
Hey, hey kid.

110
00:07:04,046 --> 00:07:05,847
You all right?

111
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:07,114
(crying)

112
00:07:07,116 --> 00:07:10,585
I want everybody off
the field right now.

113
00:07:10,587 --> 00:07:11,419
Flake, you okay?

114
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:13,089
[Flake] Fuck you.

115
00:07:16,493 --> 00:07:17,424
[Coach] Go.

116
00:07:17,426 --> 00:07:18,426
I'll talk to you in a minute.

117
00:07:18,428 --> 00:07:19,262
Go.

118
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:27,505
(subdued music)

119
00:07:33,876 --> 00:07:35,876
[Tim] Was Roddy involved?

120
00:07:35,878 --> 00:07:37,278
[Edwin] No, not this time.

121
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,313
Just the last
time then, right?

122
00:07:39,315 --> 00:07:41,415
[Edwin] He gets blamed for
a lot of stuff he doesn't do.

123
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:42,816
I know.

124
00:07:42,818 --> 00:07:46,424
He's such a misunderstood
figure, isn't he?

125
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,222
How about a new friend, pal?

126
00:07:48,224 --> 00:07:50,157
You ever think about that?

127
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,825
Maybe a friend that you
haven't seen every single day

128
00:07:51,827 --> 00:07:53,193
since you were five.

129
00:07:53,195 --> 00:07:54,364
[Janice] Tim.

130
00:07:55,532 --> 00:07:57,064
You know, you're
grounded for a week.

131
00:07:57,066 --> 00:07:58,265
You get detention,
you get grounded.

132
00:07:58,267 --> 00:08:00,234
Those are the rules.

133
00:08:00,236 --> 00:08:01,606
Hey, you hear me?

134
00:08:03,073 --> 00:08:04,239
Edwin?

135
00:08:04,241 --> 00:08:06,207
No more ice cream for me.

136
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:08,410
Ooh, you want to make it two?

137
00:08:08,412 --> 00:08:09,677
I don't care.

138
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:10,611
Hey.

139
00:08:10,613 --> 00:08:12,616
[Janice] Edwin, come on.

140
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,987
What'd you teach today?

141
00:08:19,989 --> 00:08:21,157
[Tim] Macro.

142
00:08:22,058 --> 00:08:23,191
Was it fun?

143
00:08:23,193 --> 00:08:24,025
Yeah, I had fun.

144
00:08:24,027 --> 00:08:24,859
I like Macro.

145
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:25,693
I don't know.

146
00:08:25,695 --> 00:08:26,527
I don't know what to do.

147
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:27,565
Maybe a new school?

148
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:29,631
[Edwin] I'm not going
to a private school.

149
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:30,864
[Tim] You got that right.

150
00:08:30,866 --> 00:08:32,066
[Janice] Yeah
well somewhere new

151
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:33,000
wouldn't be the
worst thing for you.

152
00:08:33,002 --> 00:08:34,034
[Tim] Is that good, Gus?

153
00:08:34,036 --> 00:08:35,604
(laughing)

154
00:08:35,606 --> 00:08:37,037
[Woman] Hey, take
a napkin, please.

155
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,907
I think Gus is gonna
turn out to be normal.

156
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:42,509
Edwin, please don't say that.

157
00:08:42,511 --> 00:08:43,979
He is.

158
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,479
[Janice] You're not abnormal.

159
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:48,248
Well, let's not rush
to judgment on that.

160
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,450
[Janice] Honey.

161
00:08:49,452 --> 00:08:50,518
What, I can't kid
around with him?

162
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,487
[Janice] It's not funny.

163
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:53,455
You're fine.

164
00:08:53,457 --> 00:08:54,288
Your mother's right.

165
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,123
You're not abnormal.

166
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:55,956
[Edwin] I'm not?

167
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:56,891
Speaking of.

168
00:08:56,893 --> 00:08:57,825
[Janice] No, you're not.

169
00:08:57,827 --> 00:08:58,893
[Tim] What, are you possessed?

170
00:08:58,895 --> 00:08:59,728
Oh, Gus.

171
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:00,798
Please, just.

172
00:09:01,898 --> 00:09:04,365
I got something on my butt.

173
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:06,301
(Tim laughs)

174
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,569
Wow.

175
00:09:07,571 --> 00:09:08,637
Well, that came
out of left field.

176
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,771
[Janice] What would that be?

177
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:11,038
- [Gus] Want to see?
- [Tim] No.

178
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,040
[Janice] Oh, my God.

179
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:13,474
Maybe later.

180
00:09:13,476 --> 00:09:14,911
[Tim] That's the normal
you're aspiring to.

181
00:09:25,989 --> 00:09:27,656
What are they watching?

182
00:09:27,658 --> 00:09:28,491
TV.

183
00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:36,567
Are there any other kids
at school who don't watch TV?

184
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:38,700
You mean, besides me?

185
00:09:38,702 --> 00:09:41,038
Oh, besides you and Roddy.

186
00:09:42,606 --> 00:09:45,440
Not that I can think of.

187
00:09:45,442 --> 00:09:49,076
Well, don't kids talk
about shows and stuff

188
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:51,345
that are on all the time?

189
00:09:51,347 --> 00:09:52,949
All the time.

190
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:58,522
What about, um, social media?

191
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:01,125
Social media?

192
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:03,490
Okay, you know what I mean.

193
00:10:03,492 --> 00:10:05,926
Facebook, Instagram, whatever.

194
00:10:05,928 --> 00:10:09,163
You and Roddy don't
do any of that stuff.

195
00:10:09,165 --> 00:10:10,330
Don't the other kids?

196
00:10:10,332 --> 00:10:11,836
Yeah, of course.

197
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:17,571
So don't you feel left out?

198
00:10:17,573 --> 00:10:18,842
All the time.

199
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:29,986
(subdued music)

200
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:44,000
(phone beeping)

201
00:10:44,634 --> 00:10:47,505
(phone ringing)

202
00:10:48,572 --> 00:10:50,338
[Man On Phone] Hello?

203
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,511
Welcome to Target World.

204
00:10:54,276 --> 00:10:55,844
[Man On Phone] What?

205
00:10:55,846 --> 00:10:57,545
Who is this?

206
00:10:57,547 --> 00:10:59,817
Emperor Samatar.

207
00:11:00,717 --> 00:11:01,582
[Man On Phone] Oh, god.

208
00:11:01,584 --> 00:11:02,816
It's you again.

209
00:11:02,818 --> 00:11:04,418
What do you got
for me this time?

210
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,521
(imitates explosion)

211
00:11:06,523 --> 00:11:08,325
Oh, God.

212
00:11:09,391 --> 00:11:10,226
Okay.

213
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:18,101
Hello?

214
00:11:18,968 --> 00:11:21,402
[Man On Phone] So, that's it?

215
00:11:21,404 --> 00:11:22,537
All right, pal.

216
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:23,941
(phone clicks)

217
00:11:58,174 --> 00:12:02,145
(tapping on glass)

218
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:24,065
Asshole.

219
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:25,135
No talking.

220
00:12:30,506 --> 00:12:31,773
Asshole.

221
00:12:31,775 --> 00:12:33,611
What did I just say?

222
00:12:35,645 --> 00:12:37,644
What is it, Mr. Sfikas?

223
00:12:37,646 --> 00:12:38,580
[Sfikas] He's swearing at me.

224
00:12:38,582 --> 00:12:39,913
Can you tell him to stop?

225
00:12:39,915 --> 00:12:41,816
[Teacher] Leave him
alone, Mr. Hanratty.

226
00:12:41,818 --> 00:12:43,250
He keeps putting his
hand down his pants

227
00:12:43,252 --> 00:12:45,619
and doing something
with himself.

228
00:12:45,621 --> 00:12:46,454
It's gross.

229
00:12:46,456 --> 00:12:47,989
The whole desk moves.

230
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:49,556
(kids laugh)

231
00:12:49,558 --> 00:12:51,594
[Teacher] Just
both of you be quiet.

232
00:13:02,838 --> 00:13:03,671
18-15.

233
00:13:03,673 --> 00:13:04,504
My ball.

234
00:13:04,506 --> 00:13:05,342
Come on.

235
00:13:07,776 --> 00:13:08,743
Asshole.

236
00:13:08,745 --> 00:13:10,210
[Edwin] Fuckwad.

237
00:13:10,212 --> 00:13:12,312
[Flake] You're
such an asshole.

238
00:13:12,314 --> 00:13:13,681
[Edwin] You're such a fuckwad.

239
00:13:13,683 --> 00:13:14,585
Oh, okay.

240
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:17,053
Nice comeback, man.

241
00:13:22,726 --> 00:13:24,528
You're so bad at this.

242
00:13:28,832 --> 00:13:30,998
(garage door bangs)

243
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,169
Fuck you, man.

244
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,838
It's your serve.

245
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,672
20-16.

246
00:13:37,674 --> 00:13:38,576
Game point.

247
00:13:48,518 --> 00:13:51,722
(Flake laughs)

248
00:13:54,491 --> 00:13:55,826
I am victorious.

249
00:13:57,226 --> 00:13:59,927
Sorry to see that game end.

250
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:01,995
Thank you, Mrs. Pengue.

251
00:14:01,997 --> 00:14:04,197
Thank you very much.

252
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:05,365
Thank you, thank you, thank you,

253
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:07,567
thank you, thank you, thank you.

254
00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:08,805
Goodbye, folks.

255
00:14:10,273 --> 00:14:11,609
Good to be here.

256
00:14:19,448 --> 00:14:20,681
[Edwin] Help me.

257
00:14:20,683 --> 00:14:22,716
(laughs) Yes.

258
00:14:22,718 --> 00:14:24,418
[Janice] So, guess
who I got a call from

259
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,585
a little bit ago?

260
00:14:25,587 --> 00:14:27,187
[Tim] Uh, the Pope.

261
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:28,022
No.

262
00:14:28,024 --> 00:14:28,922
[Tim] Who?

263
00:14:28,924 --> 00:14:30,825
Mrs. Pengue.

264
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:32,026
[Tim] Uh-huh.

265
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:34,595
Yeah, she was
surprisingly upset.

266
00:14:34,597 --> 00:14:38,769
Said she found the most
interesting thing on her table.

267
00:14:40,669 --> 00:14:41,502
[Tim] What'd she find?

268
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:42,336
(Gus grunts)

269
00:14:42,338 --> 00:14:43,437
Hey, Gus.

270
00:14:43,439 --> 00:14:44,638
Knock it off.

271
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,974
You don't know
anything about this?

272
00:14:45,976 --> 00:14:47,207
[Edwin] No.

273
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:48,142
Hey, pal. Can
you get me a beer?

274
00:14:48,144 --> 00:14:48,976
(sighs)

275
00:14:48,978 --> 00:14:49,911
Aw, listen to him sigh.

276
00:14:49,913 --> 00:14:52,515
I know, he lives to serve us.

277
00:14:53,382 --> 00:14:54,282
You don't have to do that.

278
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:55,516
Come on.

279
00:14:55,518 --> 00:14:56,450
[Tim] What's your
mother talking about?

280
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:57,685
[Edwin] I don't know.

281
00:14:57,687 --> 00:14:59,119
Well, why don't
you tell your father

282
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:01,822
what Mrs. Pengue found
on her picnic table.

283
00:15:01,824 --> 00:15:04,224
I don't know what anyone
found on their picnic table.

284
00:15:04,226 --> 00:15:05,158
Thank you.

285
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,494
[Janice] Oh, yeah, you don't?

286
00:15:06,496 --> 00:15:07,427
[Edwin] No.

287
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:08,262
I don't want basghetti.

288
00:15:08,264 --> 00:15:09,497
I want pizza.

289
00:15:09,499 --> 00:15:11,365
A severed head?

290
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:12,499
A dying weasel?

291
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:13,801
I don't know.

292
00:15:13,803 --> 00:15:15,239
[Tim] What'd she find?

293
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:17,705
All right.

294
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:21,879
Well, it was a pile of human

295
00:15:22,345 --> 00:15:23,478
poop.

296
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,046
(Gus and Tim laugh)

297
00:15:25,048 --> 00:15:26,346
What?

298
00:15:26,348 --> 00:15:27,215
(laughs)

299
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,349
Okay, that's great.

300
00:15:28,351 --> 00:15:29,383
[Tim] He was going like this.

301
00:15:29,385 --> 00:15:30,384
No, encourage him.

302
00:15:30,386 --> 00:15:31,451
Great.

303
00:15:31,453 --> 00:15:33,253
How did she know it was human?

304
00:15:33,255 --> 00:15:34,187
Sorry.

305
00:15:34,189 --> 00:15:35,123
So, you think I did it?

306
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:35,956
Yeah.

307
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:36,891
You or Roddy.

308
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:38,393
Because I didn't do anything.

309
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:41,128
I don't need you all
worked up right now.

310
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,196
I'm just asking you a question.

311
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:45,099
I want pizza.

312
00:15:45,101 --> 00:15:46,200
[Janice] Well, we're
not having pizza.

313
00:15:46,202 --> 00:15:47,167
Have a bite, please.

314
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:48,436
Come on.

315
00:15:48,438 --> 00:15:50,039
You take a dump
on Pengue's table?

316
00:15:50,506 --> 00:15:51,140
No.

317
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:55,209
Did Roddy, or Flake, whatever
he's going by these days?

318
00:15:55,211 --> 00:15:56,411
No.

319
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,244
[Tim] Who did?

320
00:15:57,246 --> 00:15:58,178
I don't know.

321
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,113
[Tim] All right, come on.

322
00:15:59,115 --> 00:16:00,047
I didn't even go in her yard.

323
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:01,048
I don't know who did it, okay?

324
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:01,849
How did it get there?

325
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:02,783
I don't...

326
00:16:02,785 --> 00:16:04,018
[Tim] One of you guys did it.

327
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,685
[Edwin] I don't know
what you want me to say.

328
00:16:04,687 --> 00:16:05,353
Don't lie.

329
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:06,186
I'm not lying.

330
00:16:06,188 --> 00:16:07,422
Hey, relax, all right?

331
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,255
We're just talking about this.

332
00:16:08,257 --> 00:16:09,891
Just tell us.

333
00:16:09,893 --> 00:16:11,158
[Edwin] I didn't do anything.

334
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,093
What is the matter?

335
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:12,893
What do you want from me?

336
00:16:12,895 --> 00:16:14,162
Hey, hey, hey, relax.

337
00:16:14,164 --> 00:16:15,028
Hey!

338
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,467
Edwin, come back!

339
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,840
What's the matter with him?

340
00:16:26,842 --> 00:16:28,611
[Tim] I don't know.

341
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:40,623
(subdued music)

342
00:17:23,765 --> 00:17:26,067
(people chattering)

343
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:28,172
[Woman] You better
be there tomorrow.

344
00:17:29,973 --> 00:17:30,937
Okay, we'll call you.

345
00:17:30,939 --> 00:17:31,775
Thanks.

346
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,366
(laughing)

347
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,399
[Dickhead] Come on, seriously.

348
00:17:59,401 --> 00:18:00,901
Have you even kissed a girl?

349
00:18:00,903 --> 00:18:03,271
[Weensie] Yeah, do you
even know what a clit is?

350
00:18:03,273 --> 00:18:04,205
I think he does.

351
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:05,639
You think he does?

352
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:06,840
[Edwin] Yeah.

353
00:18:06,842 --> 00:18:08,642
Do you know how
many holes a girl has?

354
00:18:08,644 --> 00:18:09,776
Yeah.

355
00:18:09,778 --> 00:18:11,047
[Dickhead] You do?

356
00:18:12,215 --> 00:18:13,481
Yeah.

357
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:15,349
[Dickhead] So, how many?

358
00:18:15,351 --> 00:18:16,917
Fuck off.

359
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:17,851
[Weensie] He doesn't know.

360
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:18,785
[Dickhead] I think he does.

361
00:18:18,787 --> 00:18:20,221
I think he's got 'em himself.

362
00:18:20,223 --> 00:18:21,222
Three.

363
00:18:21,224 --> 00:18:22,223
[Dickhead] Where are they?

364
00:18:22,225 --> 00:18:23,424
He said three.

365
00:18:23,426 --> 00:18:25,329
[Dickhead] Where are they?

366
00:18:26,595 --> 00:18:29,866
One in the front
and one in the back.

367
00:18:31,266 --> 00:18:32,101
And?

368
00:18:33,937 --> 00:18:35,869
(laughs) He doesn't know shit.

369
00:18:35,871 --> 00:18:38,138
[Weensie] Yeah, he knows
where his mom's holes are.

370
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,678
[Dickhead] (laughing)
Can you believe this shit?

371
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:51,252
[Man On Recording] Dropped
one bomb on Hiroshima.

372
00:18:51,254 --> 00:18:53,321
That bomb has more power

373
00:18:53,323 --> 00:18:56,692
than 20,000 tons of TNT.

374
00:19:00,897 --> 00:19:02,163
So, I had this idea.

375
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:04,165
I lifted some stuff
from Pengue's garage

376
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:06,032
when I took that
shit on her table.

377
00:19:06,034 --> 00:19:07,702
Nice move, by the way.

378
00:19:07,704 --> 00:19:09,136
The table.

379
00:19:09,138 --> 00:19:10,170
What, did you get in trouble?

380
00:19:10,172 --> 00:19:11,171
Of course I got in trouble.

381
00:19:11,173 --> 00:19:12,608
What'd you think?

382
00:19:14,076 --> 00:19:16,310
(laughs) That's awesome.

383
00:19:16,312 --> 00:19:17,978
So, I got this
bug powder, right?

384
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,814
Roten...

385
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:21,349
I don't know what it's called.

386
00:19:21,351 --> 00:19:23,317
Roten something.

387
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:25,619
It's supposed to be
like super toxic.

388
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:26,853
Oh, great.

389
00:19:26,855 --> 00:19:29,290
So now I'm gonna
get shit for that.

390
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:31,391
You're not gonna get shit
for shit, Mr. Fearless.

391
00:19:31,393 --> 00:19:33,360
I took a pound from
like a 20 pound bag.

392
00:19:33,362 --> 00:19:35,332
[Flake's Dad]
Roddy, get down here!

393
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,035
Roddy!

394
00:19:44,573 --> 00:19:46,706
[Flake] What do you want?

395
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,711
[Flake's Dad] I want
you to get down here.

396
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:53,880
[Man On Recording] It was
to spare the Japanese people

397
00:19:53,882 --> 00:19:55,782
from utter destruction

398
00:19:55,784 --> 00:19:59,957
that the ultimatum of July the
26th was issued at Potsdam.

399
00:20:01,157 --> 00:20:05,329
Their leaders promptly
rejected that ultimatum.

400
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,727
[Flake's Mom] What
did your father want?

401
00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:08,396
[Flake] He wanted
to put his dick in me.

402
00:20:08,398 --> 00:20:09,233
(door closes)

403
00:20:09,966 --> 00:20:10,669
[Flake's Mom] What?!

404
00:20:15,037 --> 00:20:16,603
I'm all alone here.

405
00:20:16,605 --> 00:20:18,441
I feel like I'm living alone.

406
00:20:20,942 --> 00:20:22,845
So, what's your idea?

407
00:20:30,453 --> 00:20:32,852
Think the bug powder will
really get people sick?

408
00:20:32,854 --> 00:20:34,524
[Flake] We'll see.

409
00:20:37,893 --> 00:20:39,159
[Edwin] Shit.

410
00:20:39,161 --> 00:20:40,828
Well, how do we get the
powder into the vents?

411
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,661
[Flake] Oh my god, dude.

412
00:20:41,663 --> 00:20:42,629
Shut up.

413
00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:44,534
Just trust me, it'll work.

414
00:20:50,505 --> 00:20:52,807
Dude, that's fucked.

415
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:55,612
The pan's not gonna
fit through there.

416
00:21:01,217 --> 00:21:04,551
Why don't we pour
some in the baggie

417
00:21:04,553 --> 00:21:07,291
and leave the
baggie open inside?

418
00:21:26,074 --> 00:21:29,712
(urine splashing)

419
00:21:33,181 --> 00:21:35,685
(tense music)

420
00:21:59,108 --> 00:22:01,108
Where are your parents?

421
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,877
Movies, dinner, Canada.

422
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:03,980
I don't know.

423
00:22:12,755 --> 00:22:15,525
Do you want to check
out my dad's guns?

424
00:22:18,361 --> 00:22:20,528
What kind's he got?

425
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,096
Guns.

426
00:22:22,098 --> 00:22:23,265
More than one.

427
00:22:39,381 --> 00:22:42,052
(bag unzipping)

428
00:22:43,151 --> 00:22:45,822
(case clicking)

429
00:22:49,624 --> 00:22:51,591
This one's a carbine.

430
00:22:51,593 --> 00:22:53,359
It's from WW Two.

431
00:22:53,361 --> 00:22:54,762
WW Two?

432
00:22:54,764 --> 00:22:57,263
(snickers) Shut up.

433
00:22:57,265 --> 00:22:59,065
That's a Kalashnikov.

434
00:22:59,067 --> 00:22:59,899
Russian.

435
00:22:59,901 --> 00:23:02,505
(gun clicking)

436
00:23:12,448 --> 00:23:15,349
And this one's called
a nine millimeter.

437
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:17,618
(gun clicking)

438
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,289
So, um,

439
00:23:21,056 --> 00:23:22,490
are these new?

440
00:23:22,492 --> 00:23:23,491
New hobby.

441
00:23:23,493 --> 00:23:26,163
He went to a gun show last week.

442
00:23:27,596 --> 00:23:29,532
Does he have bullets?

443
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,199
He hides them in
a different place.

444
00:23:33,201 --> 00:23:35,805
(gun clicking)

445
00:23:42,044 --> 00:23:44,781
(metal clanging)

446
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:01,965
(gun clicking)

447
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:09,102
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

448
00:24:09,104 --> 00:24:13,209
(sighs) What are you thinking?

449
00:24:14,944 --> 00:24:18,548
I think you're thinking
what I'm thinking.

450
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:24,318
You wanna be like those
kids at that school?

451
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,522
In Colorado?

452
00:24:26,922 --> 00:24:27,756
No.

453
00:24:29,792 --> 00:24:31,361
No, they were fuck ups.

454
00:24:32,628 --> 00:24:35,298
I don't want to be like anybody.

455
00:24:40,069 --> 00:24:43,369
What were those kids' names?

456
00:24:43,371 --> 00:24:46,240
What are you the evening news?

457
00:24:46,242 --> 00:24:48,509
Do you wanna do this or

458
00:24:48,511 --> 00:24:49,346
or not?

459
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:53,116
Hmm,

460
00:24:54,115 --> 00:24:56,419
I get to choose which one I use?

461
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,420
Well, yeah.

462
00:25:00,422 --> 00:25:01,621
We'll go in with all three.

463
00:25:01,623 --> 00:25:04,291
The nine millimeter
'll be a backup.

464
00:25:04,293 --> 00:25:06,426
We gotta, we gotta
plan it, you know.

465
00:25:06,428 --> 00:25:10,600
We gotta plan it better
than the other thing.

466
00:25:13,101 --> 00:25:15,104
Yeah, that's for sure.

467
00:25:19,342 --> 00:25:22,275
I'm not just
talking here you know.

468
00:25:22,277 --> 00:25:24,046
I'm not just playing.

469
00:25:26,716 --> 00:25:28,717
I didn't say you were.

470
00:25:32,188 --> 00:25:34,090
Are you just playing?

471
00:25:35,658 --> 00:25:36,493
No.

472
00:25:40,795 --> 00:25:42,862
I think you are just playing.

473
00:25:42,864 --> 00:25:45,301
Well, wait and see.

474
00:25:48,771 --> 00:25:50,169
[Man] Come on, one more.

475
00:25:50,171 --> 00:25:51,440
Universe point.

476
00:25:52,742 --> 00:25:55,775
(grunting)

477
00:25:55,777 --> 00:25:57,744
(basketball bouncing)

478
00:25:57,746 --> 00:26:00,417
(ambient music)

479
00:26:08,658 --> 00:26:11,824
Have you guys been working
on your photosynthesis project?

480
00:26:11,826 --> 00:26:12,661
Right, I heard about that.

481
00:26:13,862 --> 00:26:14,831
Roddy's mother
told me about it.

482
00:26:15,563 --> 00:26:16,763
Mmhm.

483
00:26:16,765 --> 00:26:19,166
I'm really looking
forward to seeing that.

484
00:26:19,168 --> 00:26:20,934
What have you learned so far

485
00:26:20,936 --> 00:26:23,169
about photosynthesis?

486
00:26:23,171 --> 00:26:24,838
[Gus] Photosynthesis.

487
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,005
Some strange shit.

488
00:26:26,007 --> 00:26:26,939
Hey.
(gus laughing)

489
00:26:26,941 --> 00:26:28,207
[Janice] Oh sweetheart,

490
00:26:28,209 --> 00:26:28,876
please don't swear in
front of your brother.

491
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,343
He can swear.

492
00:26:30,345 --> 00:26:31,578
[Tim] No, and neither
can you until you have kids

493
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,446
of your own, which God help us.

494
00:26:33,448 --> 00:26:34,747
(laughing)

495
00:26:34,749 --> 00:26:36,250
You don't make
the rules, okay?

496
00:26:36,252 --> 00:26:37,150
[Gus] Yeah I do.

497
00:26:37,152 --> 00:26:38,420
Alright, Gus.

498
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:42,055
So we got a nice call from
the vice principal today.

499
00:26:42,057 --> 00:26:43,523
What'd he want?

500
00:26:43,525 --> 00:26:45,259
He wants us all to meet.

501
00:26:45,261 --> 00:26:46,894
[Gus] Mom!

502
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:47,828
Mom!

503
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,196
So we're all gonna meet?

504
00:26:49,198 --> 00:26:50,397
[Janice] What?

505
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:51,831
I thought we
talked about this?

506
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,434
[Gus] Mommy!

507
00:26:53,436 --> 00:26:55,334
[Janice] Gus, what?

508
00:26:55,336 --> 00:26:56,302
[Gus] Mommy!

509
00:26:56,304 --> 00:26:57,137
My gosh.

510
00:26:57,139 --> 00:26:58,504
Yes, hon?

511
00:26:58,506 --> 00:27:00,376
You're driving me nuts.

512
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,378
Don't look at me.

513
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,913
[Tim] You don't want
us to look at you?

514
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,347
You're okay?

515
00:27:07,349 --> 00:27:09,049
[Tim] I'm getting very
mixed messages from you, Gus.

516
00:27:09,051 --> 00:27:09,983
Very weird.

517
00:27:09,985 --> 00:27:11,118
[Gus] I want my Nerf ball.

518
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,552
No, hon,

519
00:27:12,554 --> 00:27:14,187
- no balls at the table, okay?
- Now what's a matter?

520
00:27:14,189 --> 00:27:16,724
Do I just have a
sign on my face today?

521
00:27:16,726 --> 00:27:18,958
You got a glass head.

522
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,127
Remember we use
to say that to you

523
00:27:20,129 --> 00:27:21,261
when you were little.

524
00:27:21,263 --> 00:27:22,562
Little glass head.

525
00:27:22,564 --> 00:27:23,400
Yeah.

526
00:27:24,432 --> 00:27:26,667
What am I thinking right now?

527
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:29,102
You're thinking, um,

528
00:27:29,104 --> 00:27:32,773
(sighs) I wish they'd
leave me alone.

529
00:27:32,775 --> 00:27:34,207
(snickering)

530
00:27:34,209 --> 00:27:37,144
He's thinking, why do
I have to eat with them?

531
00:27:37,146 --> 00:27:40,080
(laughing)

532
00:27:40,082 --> 00:27:41,881
[Tim] Close?

533
00:27:41,883 --> 00:27:43,850
[Janice] It's okay, hon.

534
00:27:43,852 --> 00:27:46,523
(ambient music)

535
00:28:40,775 --> 00:28:42,810
Looks great though.

536
00:28:42,812 --> 00:28:44,477
What are you working on?

537
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:45,913
Nothing.

538
00:28:45,915 --> 00:28:46,750
Hey!

539
00:28:47,749 --> 00:28:49,986
That's really great, Edwin.

540
00:28:51,286 --> 00:28:52,718
It's my brother.

541
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,790
Oh that's your brother.

542
00:28:56,659 --> 00:28:58,058
It's really good.

543
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,593
It's a great use of color.

544
00:29:00,595 --> 00:29:02,832
Yeah, keep working on that.

545
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,167
How's it going over here, huh?

546
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:11,341
(students chattering)

547
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,281
Hey, Edwin.

548
00:29:19,715 --> 00:29:21,682
So listen, we have to do
this world of color thing

549
00:29:21,684 --> 00:29:23,550
with three people in art class.

550
00:29:23,552 --> 00:29:24,386
And?

551
00:29:25,553 --> 00:29:27,724
Ms. Arnold says
you're really good.

552
00:29:28,323 --> 00:29:29,255
You are.

553
00:29:29,257 --> 00:29:30,189
You're a really good artist.

554
00:29:30,191 --> 00:29:32,428
(baying)

555
00:29:35,096 --> 00:29:36,932
What are you doing?

556
00:29:39,735 --> 00:29:42,002
You want time
to think about it?

557
00:29:42,004 --> 00:29:42,839
Um,

558
00:29:44,939 --> 00:29:45,842
yeah, okay.

559
00:29:47,476 --> 00:29:50,914
Don't forget, we
want you for our trio.

560
00:29:52,014 --> 00:29:55,385
(laughs) Tawanda
wants to touch your art.

561
00:29:58,086 --> 00:30:02,257
So there are eight doors
in and out of the school.

562
00:30:03,124 --> 00:30:04,827
Thought there were more.

563
00:30:07,396 --> 00:30:09,228
I'm sorry, it's like,

564
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,031
it's not like you
never made a mistake.

565
00:30:11,033 --> 00:30:12,198
You're a mistake.

566
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,536
[Edwin] Your
mother's a mistake.

567
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:18,205
God, I wish I could
do this by myself.

568
00:30:18,207 --> 00:30:19,542
Why don't you?

569
00:30:23,379 --> 00:30:27,414
Okay, so we have to
seal up all the doors?

570
00:30:27,416 --> 00:30:28,948
Yeah, but that's
the problem, dude.

571
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,716
We have to get from there
to there to there to there

572
00:30:30,718 --> 00:30:33,789
and we have to do
it relatively fast.

573
00:30:36,891 --> 00:30:40,026
Why don't we do something
to these doors ahead of time

574
00:30:40,028 --> 00:30:43,196
and we can come in
through these two?

575
00:30:43,198 --> 00:30:46,768
We could do it in the
gym during an assembly.

576
00:30:50,104 --> 00:30:53,273
(train horn blowing)

577
00:30:53,275 --> 00:30:55,011
That's a good idea.

578
00:30:57,278 --> 00:30:59,515
This is a good idea, Edwin.

579
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:04,920
(metal clanging)

580
00:31:11,326 --> 00:31:12,928
What about these?

581
00:31:16,532 --> 00:31:17,464
How long does it take to pull

582
00:31:17,466 --> 00:31:20,434
some bungee cords off of a door?

583
00:31:20,436 --> 00:31:21,971
(sighing)

584
00:31:25,873 --> 00:31:27,773
How 'bout scotch tape?

585
00:31:27,775 --> 00:31:29,379
I was just asking.

586
00:31:29,978 --> 00:31:32,414
(metal clanging)

587
00:31:36,986 --> 00:31:38,118
Why don't we put
this in the door

588
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,253
and slide it through the bars?

589
00:31:41,255 --> 00:31:42,488
I thought of that.

590
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:43,889
You could just slide it
right back out again.

591
00:31:43,891 --> 00:31:45,160
Right.

592
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,437
(distant country music)

593
00:31:56,271 --> 00:31:59,042
(engine roaring)

594
00:32:03,911 --> 00:32:04,913
Gentlemen.

595
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,449
Suppose your
brakes didn't work?

596
00:32:10,451 --> 00:32:12,121
My point entirely.

597
00:32:25,266 --> 00:32:28,871
Your parents ever try to get
you interested in sports?

598
00:32:33,074 --> 00:32:33,909
Music?

599
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:35,745
Nah.

600
00:32:37,813 --> 00:32:41,013
We tried to get Roddy
excited about music.

601
00:32:41,015 --> 00:32:44,384
You got me one of those
pianos for like one year olds.

602
00:32:44,386 --> 00:32:46,719
Do you want a real piano?

603
00:32:46,721 --> 00:32:47,987
No!

604
00:32:47,989 --> 00:32:49,222
We'll get you a real
piano if you want one.

605
00:32:49,224 --> 00:32:50,057
If you'll play it.

606
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:51,661
I don't want one!

607
00:32:53,762 --> 00:32:56,963
Roddy's grandmother
was a wonderful musician.

608
00:32:56,965 --> 00:32:58,432
Was she?

609
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,500
[Flake's Dad] She coulda
been a professional.

610
00:33:00,502 --> 00:33:01,868
All she did was
complain about her health

611
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:04,571
and she lived to be like 102.

612
00:33:04,573 --> 00:33:06,238
[Flake's Dad] What'd he say?

613
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,843
What do you care?

614
00:33:09,078 --> 00:33:11,447
How did I end up with
a kid with no ambition?

615
00:33:12,648 --> 00:33:14,613
Don't worry about
the no ambition part.

616
00:33:14,615 --> 00:33:15,916
[Flake's Dad] You got some?

617
00:33:15,918 --> 00:33:17,184
I'm working on it.

618
00:33:17,186 --> 00:33:19,586
You don't look like
you're working on it.

619
00:33:19,588 --> 00:33:22,558
I'm, I'm working
on it right now.

620
00:33:24,092 --> 00:33:24,927
Alright.

621
00:33:33,067 --> 00:33:35,237
(sighing)

622
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:44,013
(can spraying)

623
00:33:49,918 --> 00:33:51,784
What are you doing?

624
00:33:51,786 --> 00:33:55,357
(can shaking and spraying)

625
00:34:00,129 --> 00:34:01,328
Dude, your dad's gonna be pissed

626
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,629
with all this
paint on the floor!

627
00:34:03,631 --> 00:34:05,499
(can spraying)

628
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,565
You can fuck up
your skin like this

629
00:34:06,567 --> 00:34:08,068
if you do it long enough.

630
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:10,669
(can spraying)

631
00:34:10,671 --> 00:34:13,342
(ominous music)

632
00:34:21,015 --> 00:34:24,619
(can shaking and spraying)

633
00:34:30,925 --> 00:34:33,762
(muffled talking)

634
00:34:43,271 --> 00:34:45,507
Does that sound
about right, Edwin?

635
00:34:47,642 --> 00:34:50,644
Yeah, sounds about right.

636
00:34:50,646 --> 00:34:52,412
Well, here's what
we've been noticing.

637
00:34:52,414 --> 00:34:55,148
Edwin acts like he's
under constant pressure.

638
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,017
He's either very
quiet or acting out

639
00:34:57,019 --> 00:34:58,919
in various anti-social ways.

640
00:34:58,921 --> 00:35:00,287
He's very bright,

641
00:35:00,289 --> 00:35:01,787
and has a very good
head on his shoulders.

642
00:35:01,789 --> 00:35:03,890
Mrs. Arnold says he's been
working very diligently

643
00:35:03,892 --> 00:35:06,526
with others on his art
project in her class.

644
00:35:06,528 --> 00:35:07,693
I've seen his work
and it's very.

645
00:35:07,695 --> 00:35:08,827
What art project?

646
00:35:08,829 --> 00:35:11,530
It's just this art thing.

647
00:35:11,532 --> 00:35:13,832
It's for a competition
or something.

648
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:15,834
Okay, so the reason why

649
00:35:15,836 --> 00:35:18,738
we wanted to talk with you guys

650
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,939
is we have noticed a shift,

651
00:35:19,941 --> 00:35:22,876
obviously in
behavior, this year.

652
00:35:22,878 --> 00:35:25,579
And I guess we were
curious if you've noticed

653
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:29,249
anything in particular that
happened over the summer.

654
00:35:29,251 --> 00:35:32,421
Was there any kind
of traumatic event?

655
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:37,459
I mean, no.

656
00:35:38,193 --> 00:35:39,061
Not that I know of.

657
00:35:39,961 --> 00:35:40,795
No.

658
00:35:41,997 --> 00:35:43,195
Okay, well what
about you, Edwin,

659
00:35:43,197 --> 00:35:45,932
have you noticed anything?

660
00:35:45,934 --> 00:35:47,370
No, not really.

661
00:35:49,671 --> 00:35:52,275
You can't think of one thing?

662
00:35:54,409 --> 00:35:55,577
Well, I got older.

663
00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:02,115
So where do we go from here?

664
00:36:02,117 --> 00:36:02,985
Yeah.

665
00:36:04,151 --> 00:36:07,187
Right, okay well
one place to start

666
00:36:07,189 --> 00:36:08,887
is we offer a program

667
00:36:08,889 --> 00:36:12,561
for extra work
with socialization.

668
00:36:13,729 --> 00:36:16,129
You mean for like
special ed kids?

669
00:36:16,131 --> 00:36:17,631
No, no.

670
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,966
It's a workshop to help those
who are having difficulties

671
00:36:19,968 --> 00:36:23,769
and it's designed to
build teamwork, and trust,

672
00:36:23,771 --> 00:36:25,437
and they do really fun stuff.

673
00:36:25,439 --> 00:36:28,341
They do skits, they
do hypotheticals.

674
00:36:28,343 --> 00:36:29,876
How do you feel about that?

675
00:36:29,878 --> 00:36:31,845
Is that something that is
worth a try for you guys?

676
00:36:31,847 --> 00:36:33,847
(sighing)

677
00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:34,847
I'm fine with that.

678
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:36,082
- Okay.
- Yeah.

679
00:36:36,084 --> 00:36:37,617
What about the patient?

680
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:40,053
How does that sound?

681
00:36:40,055 --> 00:36:41,854
Fine with me.

682
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,055
Fine with you.

683
00:36:43,057 --> 00:36:44,726
Okay, everything's
fine with you.

684
00:36:47,762 --> 00:36:49,729
[Ms. Meier] Well we will
try to keep an eye out

685
00:36:49,731 --> 00:36:51,765
- on things on our end.
- Yeah, yeah, great.

686
00:36:51,767 --> 00:36:52,599
[Janice] Okay, thanks.

687
00:36:52,601 --> 00:36:53,436
Thank you.

688
00:36:54,535 --> 00:36:57,606
(train horn blowing)

689
00:37:06,081 --> 00:37:07,416
Hey, fuck off!

690
00:37:09,851 --> 00:37:11,117
This is ours.

691
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,820
What do you own
the railroad now?

692
00:37:13,822 --> 00:37:15,021
Those are ours too.

693
00:37:15,023 --> 00:37:16,722
What, are you gonna
hit us with that?

694
00:37:16,724 --> 00:37:20,829
You're trying to fuckin'
scare me with a rock?

695
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,162
Dude, give me the sketchpads.

696
00:37:23,164 --> 00:37:24,330
Put the rock down.

697
00:37:24,332 --> 00:37:25,131
Give me the
fucking sketchpads!

698
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:26,466
Put the rock down.

699
00:37:26,468 --> 00:37:29,305
(heavy breathing)

700
00:37:33,642 --> 00:37:34,640
(thudding)

701
00:37:34,642 --> 00:37:37,376
Those drawings suck by the way.

702
00:37:37,378 --> 00:37:38,778
Find another place
to blow each other.

703
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,381
(laughing)

704
00:37:41,383 --> 00:37:44,053
(ambient music)

705
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:53,693
Take your little gay
drawings with you.

706
00:37:53,695 --> 00:37:55,861
[Boy] What the fuck is this?

707
00:37:55,863 --> 00:37:59,499
They've got whole drawers
full of this crap. (laughs)

708
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:02,104
(ambient music)

709
00:38:16,785 --> 00:38:18,553
You still pissed?

710
00:38:19,954 --> 00:38:21,790
You still pissed?

711
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:25,260
Here put this in your mouth.

712
00:38:34,936 --> 00:38:37,740
You think we're
really gonna do this?

713
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,515
I don't know.

714
00:38:48,582 --> 00:38:51,151
Let's talk about it later.

715
00:38:51,153 --> 00:38:51,986
Okay.

716
00:38:58,126 --> 00:39:00,959
Man we are such pussies.

717
00:39:00,961 --> 00:39:03,231
(rustling)

718
00:39:06,434 --> 00:39:09,003
(solemn music)

719
00:39:21,849 --> 00:39:24,119
Ding-a-ling-ling-ling.
(door bells jingle)

720
00:39:32,494 --> 00:39:34,896
(chattering)

721
00:39:36,197 --> 00:39:37,031
Pst.

722
00:39:38,233 --> 00:39:41,504
- Dude any of these work.
- Hermie.

723
00:39:42,102 --> 00:39:43,202
You got money?

724
00:39:43,204 --> 00:39:45,671
I'm buying
something for myself.

725
00:39:45,673 --> 00:39:48,843
You buy somethin' for me,
you can hang around with us.

726
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:51,514
Take off.

727
00:39:52,914 --> 00:39:54,347
You heard him, come on.

728
00:39:54,349 --> 00:39:55,551
Oh man.

729
00:39:58,919 --> 00:39:59,755
Come on.

730
00:40:00,655 --> 00:40:02,291
I know what I want.

731
00:40:07,561 --> 00:40:10,062
So you know that
kid Budzinski?

732
00:40:10,064 --> 00:40:12,164
No, why? You kick his ass?

733
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:15,103
No. He kicked mine.

734
00:40:16,671 --> 00:40:18,570
You look okay to me.

735
00:40:18,572 --> 00:40:20,539
What'd he use a pillow?

736
00:40:20,541 --> 00:40:21,376
No.

737
00:40:23,077 --> 00:40:25,747
(car drives up)

738
00:40:31,218 --> 00:40:32,720
Your dad's here.

739
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:39,658
(car door closes)

740
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,561
Nice ride homie.

741
00:40:41,563 --> 00:40:43,129
Who's this?

742
00:40:43,131 --> 00:40:44,597
Friend of ours.

743
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:46,164
[Tim] He got a name?

744
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:47,934
- Hermie.
- Herman.

745
00:40:47,936 --> 00:40:49,801
[Tim] Seriously,
what's his real name?

746
00:40:49,803 --> 00:40:51,137
- Herman.
- Hermie.

747
00:40:51,139 --> 00:40:52,207
Herman?

748
00:40:56,378 --> 00:40:57,709
(doorbells jingling)

749
00:40:57,711 --> 00:40:59,347
[Herman] Nice guy.

750
00:41:12,793 --> 00:41:14,093
- (doorbells jingling)
- So you're hanging out

751
00:41:14,095 --> 00:41:15,764
in parking lots now?

752
00:41:16,664 --> 00:41:17,763
Library's closed.

753
00:41:17,765 --> 00:41:18,997
[Tim] Oh that's funny.

754
00:41:18,999 --> 00:41:21,434
Get in the car I'll
give you a ride home.

755
00:41:21,436 --> 00:41:22,901
I just ate.

756
00:41:22,903 --> 00:41:23,738
Get in.

757
00:41:25,606 --> 00:41:27,409
Can we get a ride too?

758
00:41:28,175 --> 00:41:30,278
Say bye to the homies.

759
00:41:32,847 --> 00:41:34,182
(car doors close)

760
00:41:40,722 --> 00:41:43,323
You don't have
any other friends?

761
00:41:43,325 --> 00:41:45,024
Who else am I supposed
to be hanging out with?

762
00:41:45,026 --> 00:41:46,492
I don't know,
somebody at your school.

763
00:41:46,494 --> 00:41:47,459
It's a big school you go to.

764
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:48,463
You can't...

765
00:41:50,932 --> 00:41:52,731
You still getting in fights?

766
00:41:52,733 --> 00:41:55,033
- Fights?
- Yeah fights.

767
00:41:55,035 --> 00:41:56,535
What are these fights anyway?

768
00:41:56,537 --> 00:41:57,803
How are they starting?

769
00:41:57,805 --> 00:42:00,309
I hate that, I hate the
thought of you fighting.

770
00:42:01,476 --> 00:42:02,608
Well then don't
think about it.

771
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:03,542
[Tim] Okay.

772
00:42:03,544 --> 00:42:04,711
They're certainly not fights.

773
00:42:04,713 --> 00:42:06,849
Well what are they then?

774
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:10,450
When are we gonna
stop this sport, huh?

775
00:42:10,452 --> 00:42:12,852
What a week? A month? A year?

776
00:42:12,854 --> 00:42:14,086
- We have to wait a year?
- A week.

777
00:42:14,088 --> 00:42:15,120
A week?

778
00:42:15,122 --> 00:42:16,955
Okay I hope so.

779
00:42:16,957 --> 00:42:19,595
That would be
great for everyone.

780
00:42:20,762 --> 00:42:22,495
You tell your mom
where you were?

781
00:42:22,497 --> 00:42:24,796
Yeah, I left a note.

782
00:42:24,798 --> 00:42:27,265
Well you got some mouth
on you, you know that?

783
00:42:27,267 --> 00:42:28,468
Sorry.

784
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:29,669
If you're not
gonna help yourself

785
00:42:29,671 --> 00:42:32,671
if you're not gonna
make an effort at least.

786
00:42:32,673 --> 00:42:33,773
I know you're
havin' a hard time.

787
00:42:33,775 --> 00:42:35,541
A lot of kids have a hard time.

788
00:42:35,543 --> 00:42:36,809
I had a hard time
when I was your age.

789
00:42:36,811 --> 00:42:37,776
Yeah, sure you did.

790
00:42:37,778 --> 00:42:38,711
Oh you don't believe me?

791
00:42:38,713 --> 00:42:40,213
I just said I did.

792
00:42:40,215 --> 00:42:41,648
Okay, so you're the only kid
who's ever gotten beaten up?

793
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:43,552
I didn't even bring this up.

794
00:42:45,986 --> 00:42:47,222
Light's green

795
00:42:48,055 --> 00:42:50,492
(horn honks)

796
00:42:54,963 --> 00:42:57,566
(sad music)

797
00:42:58,166 --> 00:43:01,903
(chattering)

798
00:43:24,925 --> 00:43:28,229
Hey. It's okay
to be gay you know?

799
00:43:29,631 --> 00:43:32,868
My sister in high school,
she's in the Lesbian Alliance.

800
00:43:34,068 --> 00:43:36,669
What are you talking about?

801
00:43:36,671 --> 00:43:38,336
I told you.

802
00:43:38,338 --> 00:43:40,872
What did you tell her?

803
00:43:40,874 --> 00:43:42,341
I told her not to bring it up.

804
00:43:42,343 --> 00:43:44,577
Look, it was hard
for my sister too.

805
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:47,747
She said she wishes somebody
had talked to her about it.

806
00:43:47,749 --> 00:43:49,948
You're sitting here
and calling us gay?

807
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:52,350
Look, it's not
a judgment thing.

808
00:43:52,352 --> 00:43:54,454
Oh okay, okay.

809
00:43:54,456 --> 00:43:56,155
And if I called you
a fuckin' skank,

810
00:43:56,157 --> 00:43:59,695
would you say that that's
not a judgment thing?

811
00:44:00,928 --> 00:44:03,361
I hurt your feelings?

812
00:44:03,363 --> 00:44:04,863
I hurt her feelings.

813
00:44:04,865 --> 00:44:07,633
She calls me fucking queer
and I hurt her feelings.

814
00:44:07,635 --> 00:44:08,834
Just forget it okay?

815
00:44:08,836 --> 00:44:10,236
What? No we're not
going to just forget it.

816
00:44:10,238 --> 00:44:11,738
Flake.

817
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:12,972
Fuck you too. Hey, giz
bag, listen to something.

818
00:44:12,974 --> 00:44:14,573
Don't touch me.

819
00:44:14,575 --> 00:44:16,441
Tell her she's
gotta talk to me.

820
00:44:16,443 --> 00:44:17,676
I'm not getting in
the middle of this.

821
00:44:17,678 --> 00:44:19,077
If somebody said
bad shit about you,

822
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:20,445
- we'd tell you who it was.
- Yeah.

823
00:44:20,447 --> 00:44:22,215
I was just trying to help.

824
00:44:22,217 --> 00:44:23,885
Who told you that?

825
00:44:26,253 --> 00:44:28,187
Matthew Sfikas.

826
00:44:28,189 --> 00:44:30,356
Who the fuck is
Matthew Sfikas?

827
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:32,024
Shit, he's that ninth
grader from detention.

828
00:44:32,026 --> 00:44:34,660
Well what's his damage?

829
00:44:34,662 --> 00:44:38,530
I told the monitor he
was playing with himself.

830
00:44:38,532 --> 00:44:40,533
He's just getting even.

831
00:44:40,535 --> 00:44:41,466
(sighs)

832
00:44:41,468 --> 00:44:43,169
He said he saw you guys.

833
00:44:43,171 --> 00:44:45,037
That's the only
reason I believed it.

834
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:46,738
What did he say
he saw us doing?

835
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,776
Look, just forget it.

836
00:44:51,311 --> 00:44:52,313
Who is he?

837
00:44:53,414 --> 00:44:55,515
Point him out,
come on. Who is he?

838
00:44:55,517 --> 00:44:56,615
Point him out. Point him out.

839
00:44:56,617 --> 00:44:58,450
Dude he's not here right now.

840
00:44:58,452 --> 00:45:02,320
You know what? Nice
dining with you all.

841
00:45:02,322 --> 00:45:04,325
(sighs)

842
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:10,428
(slams table)
(chattering)

843
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:13,101
(intense music)

844
00:45:33,521 --> 00:45:35,387
[Edwin] Why get 100 years
of detention for this kid

845
00:45:35,389 --> 00:45:38,157
when we can just save
him for our thing?

846
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:40,392
I'll kick his ass now
and we can shoot him later.

847
00:45:40,394 --> 00:45:41,593
How are you gonna
kick anyone's ass

848
00:45:41,595 --> 00:45:44,032
with your hand all fucked up?

849
00:45:45,265 --> 00:45:46,899
I'll use a shovel.
I'll use a rake.

850
00:45:46,901 --> 00:45:48,971
You can't use a shovel.

851
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:51,003
(sighs)

852
00:45:51,005 --> 00:45:52,470
What the fuck do you care?

853
00:45:52,472 --> 00:45:53,805
I'll use a chainsaw if I want.

854
00:45:53,807 --> 00:45:56,142
Oh okay. Let's find him then.

855
00:45:56,144 --> 00:45:58,376
Why don't you bring your rake?

856
00:45:58,378 --> 00:45:59,611
Why don't you put bug
powder in his milk

857
00:45:59,613 --> 00:46:02,515
since that worked so
fuckin' great last...

858
00:46:02,517 --> 00:46:03,515
Flake.

859
00:46:03,517 --> 00:46:05,353
(fighting)
(slamming)

860
00:46:05,954 --> 00:46:07,086
What the fuck?

861
00:46:07,088 --> 00:46:08,820
Get the fuck off me asshole.

862
00:46:08,822 --> 00:46:09,955
Get the fuck down.

863
00:46:09,957 --> 00:46:10,789
Oww.

864
00:46:10,791 --> 00:46:11,659
(grunting)

865
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:13,992
(hitting)

866
00:46:13,994 --> 00:46:16,030
- I'm sick of your shit.
- Asshole.

867
00:46:16,631 --> 00:46:17,332
Fuck you.

868
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,497
Fuck you.

869
00:46:19,499 --> 00:46:20,633
(coughing)

870
00:46:20,635 --> 00:46:23,939
(heavy breathing)

871
00:46:29,878 --> 00:46:33,282
Roddy. Roddy what
is going on up there?

872
00:46:35,215 --> 00:46:36,948
Roddy, what's goin' on?

873
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:38,450
(slamming)

874
00:46:38,452 --> 00:46:40,285
Woah, woah, woah.
Alright, woah, hold on.

875
00:46:40,287 --> 00:46:42,287
Roddy, Roddy, Roddy,
no. You stop it.

876
00:46:42,289 --> 00:46:43,124
Fuck you.

877
00:46:44,191 --> 00:46:44,990
- Roddy.
- Fucking maggot.

878
00:46:44,992 --> 00:46:45,925
You piece of shit.

879
00:46:45,927 --> 00:46:47,260
Get the fuck out of my house.

880
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:50,028
- Get out of my house.
- Stop it. Stop it.

881
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:51,499
[Flake] Fuck you.

882
00:46:51,965 --> 00:46:52,767
Roddy.

883
00:46:54,235 --> 00:46:55,100
Get out.

884
00:46:55,102 --> 00:46:57,773
(heavy breathing)

885
00:47:00,207 --> 00:47:02,010
(door slams)

886
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:04,412
I bet she is.

887
00:47:05,146 --> 00:47:06,379
Oh here he comes.

888
00:47:06,381 --> 00:47:07,379
Hey we hear you and
Roddy thought you were

889
00:47:07,381 --> 00:47:09,050
in Thunder Dome.

890
00:47:10,184 --> 00:47:12,754
I don't know what that means.

891
00:47:14,389 --> 00:47:16,358
Roddy's mother called us.

892
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:17,859
Are you alright?

893
00:47:20,227 --> 00:47:21,063
Buddy.

894
00:47:23,363 --> 00:47:25,830
Want me to clean you up?

895
00:47:25,832 --> 00:47:28,334
(cries)
Yeah?

896
00:47:28,336 --> 00:47:30,272
Oh honey, okay, okay.

897
00:47:34,675 --> 00:47:35,509
Okay.

898
00:47:38,046 --> 00:47:41,717
Fucking asshole.
(crying)

899
00:47:49,791 --> 00:47:52,126
(sad music)

900
00:48:02,102 --> 00:48:03,436
(door opens)

901
00:48:03,438 --> 00:48:06,472
Oh, you're dressed already.

902
00:48:06,474 --> 00:48:08,240
[Edwin] Couldn't sleep.

903
00:48:08,242 --> 00:48:09,278
Again?

904
00:48:10,677 --> 00:48:13,614
Okay well come downstairs,
I'll make you some breakfast.

905
00:48:14,215 --> 00:48:16,251
(solemn music)

906
00:48:32,867 --> 00:48:35,470
(locker slams)

907
00:48:36,838 --> 00:48:38,838
[Teacher] You have 45
minutes to complete the test.

908
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,008
It'll start when I say go.

909
00:48:50,617 --> 00:48:53,287
(child yelling and laughing)

910
00:48:58,258 --> 00:49:00,559
- Really good work you guys.
- Thank you.

911
00:49:00,561 --> 00:49:02,928
I can't wait for this
to go in the contest.

912
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:04,229
[Girl] Gotta think
of a name guys.

913
00:49:04,231 --> 00:49:05,499
[Teacher] Think
of a title, yeah.

914
00:49:09,436 --> 00:49:11,439
(sighs)

915
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:26,153
(car driving by)

916
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:40,736
(car door shuts)

917
00:49:44,171 --> 00:49:46,472
What are you doin' down there?

918
00:49:46,474 --> 00:49:48,043
I'm resting.

919
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:51,077
[Man] Is it comfortable?

920
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:52,814
Yeah, more or less.

921
00:49:55,849 --> 00:49:57,550
Model rocketry.

922
00:49:57,552 --> 00:49:58,720
You wanna see?

923
00:50:00,787 --> 00:50:01,622
No.

924
00:50:07,762 --> 00:50:10,432
(rocket blasts)

925
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:17,572
(calm music)

926
00:50:23,177 --> 00:50:25,613
(chattering)

927
00:50:27,347 --> 00:50:30,151
Mr. Edwin. Hey can I
talk to you a second?

928
00:50:30,617 --> 00:50:32,117
Now?

929
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:33,919
I know, I hate to bother
your fine dining experience.

930
00:50:33,921 --> 00:50:36,622
Get over here for a second.

931
00:50:36,624 --> 00:50:37,789
This is good.

932
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:39,457
(groans)

933
00:50:39,459 --> 00:50:40,992
Hey so I wanted to check in

934
00:50:40,994 --> 00:50:43,262
and see how you're feelin'

935
00:50:43,264 --> 00:50:45,497
about this
socialization workshop.

936
00:50:45,499 --> 00:50:46,465
God.

937
00:50:46,467 --> 00:50:48,233
Oh come on, man.

938
00:50:48,235 --> 00:50:50,503
It's not gonna be that bad.

939
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:52,604
You gotta just give it a shot.

940
00:50:52,606 --> 00:50:54,707
The bonus is it's during school

941
00:50:54,709 --> 00:50:57,879
so you get to miss
some class anyways.

942
00:51:01,782 --> 00:51:04,452
Alright here's the deal Edwin.

943
00:51:05,653 --> 00:51:08,153
The feeling is you can't
go on like this, man.

944
00:51:08,155 --> 00:51:09,120
You can't.

945
00:51:09,122 --> 00:51:11,293
The fights, the headaches.

946
00:51:12,459 --> 00:51:15,896
Somethin' pretty
extreme needs to happen.

947
00:51:21,501 --> 00:51:23,572
Okay here eat your lunch.

948
00:51:46,994 --> 00:51:49,794
(phone dials)

949
00:51:49,796 --> 00:51:52,601
(phone rings)

950
00:51:58,439 --> 00:52:01,209
(phone hangs up)

951
00:52:09,082 --> 00:52:11,249
You gotta help me
with this kid Budzinski.

952
00:52:11,251 --> 00:52:12,786
Who is this kid?

953
00:52:14,155 --> 00:52:16,925
You ever wash this shirt?

954
00:52:17,557 --> 00:52:18,659
My mom does.

955
00:52:19,526 --> 00:52:21,595
You ever wash those pants?

956
00:52:23,831 --> 00:52:25,530
So are you gonna help me?

957
00:52:25,532 --> 00:52:26,865
Help you what?

958
00:52:26,867 --> 00:52:28,466
With Budzinski.

959
00:52:28,468 --> 00:52:30,001
I just need help with a plan.

960
00:52:30,003 --> 00:52:31,503
A plan?

961
00:52:31,505 --> 00:52:34,439
Just hide behind a bush
and hit him with a stick.

962
00:52:34,441 --> 00:52:35,910
That's a plan?

963
00:52:36,977 --> 00:52:38,343
He's a seventh
grader, take his candy.

964
00:52:38,345 --> 00:52:40,278
Push him down in the sandbox.

965
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,180
I went after him
with a whiffle bat.

966
00:52:42,182 --> 00:52:43,918
A whiffle bat?

967
00:52:45,086 --> 00:52:47,222
Took it away from me
and beat me with it.

968
00:52:50,423 --> 00:52:52,358
Hey man, it happens.

969
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:56,028
No it doesn't.
Not to anybody else.

970
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:59,200
I get my ass kicked all
the time, are you kidding?

971
00:53:00,401 --> 00:53:02,604
Maybe I'll just
get my dad's gun.

972
00:53:03,204 --> 00:53:04,470
What?

973
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:06,472
See what he does then.

974
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:08,207
Don't be an idiot.

975
00:53:08,209 --> 00:53:10,108
That'll teach him
not to fuck with me.

976
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:11,175
Of course he
can fuck with you,

977
00:53:11,177 --> 00:53:13,047
you're like two feet tall.

978
00:53:13,914 --> 00:53:15,350
You can't just get a gun.

979
00:53:17,517 --> 00:53:19,286
Just leave me alone.

980
00:53:21,322 --> 00:53:24,892
All I know is someone's
gotta do something.

981
00:53:27,762 --> 00:53:30,265
(phone rings)

982
00:53:32,566 --> 00:53:33,666
Hello?

983
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,100
We got a problem.

984
00:53:35,102 --> 00:53:37,973
(phone hangs up)

985
00:53:40,206 --> 00:53:43,477
(phone dials)

986
00:53:44,778 --> 00:53:47,282
(phone rings)

987
00:53:48,381 --> 00:53:50,385
Don't hang up fuck head.

988
00:53:54,088 --> 00:53:55,354
Hello?

989
00:53:55,356 --> 00:53:56,521
[Flake] I'm still here.

990
00:53:56,523 --> 00:53:58,856
We got a problem.

991
00:53:58,858 --> 00:54:01,292
[Flake] So I hear.

992
00:54:01,294 --> 00:54:02,593
You already know?

993
00:54:02,595 --> 00:54:05,129
[Flake] You just
fuckin' told me.

994
00:54:05,131 --> 00:54:06,765
(sighs)

995
00:54:06,767 --> 00:54:08,600
So what's the problem?

996
00:54:08,602 --> 00:54:10,568
[Edwin] Our pal Hermie.

997
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:11,803
He told me he's getting a gun

998
00:54:11,805 --> 00:54:12,970
and going after
that kid he hates.

999
00:54:12,972 --> 00:54:14,439
(snickers)

1000
00:54:14,441 --> 00:54:16,975
No, I don't think
he's bullshitting.

1001
00:54:16,977 --> 00:54:19,748
I'm thinking he'd screw
it up for the both of us.

1002
00:54:20,881 --> 00:54:22,113
That certainly
is the type of shit

1003
00:54:22,115 --> 00:54:24,285
that always happens to us.

1004
00:54:26,619 --> 00:54:28,387
So what'd you tell him?

1005
00:54:28,389 --> 00:54:31,256
I told him he
couldn't just get a gun.

1006
00:54:31,258 --> 00:54:33,595
[Flake] And what'd he say?

1007
00:54:36,162 --> 00:54:38,329
[Janice] Hey can we talk?

1008
00:54:38,331 --> 00:54:40,499
Didn't say anything.

1009
00:54:40,501 --> 00:54:41,636
[Flake] Hmm.

1010
00:54:42,903 --> 00:54:44,436
[Edwin] I think we
gotta talk to him.

1011
00:54:44,438 --> 00:54:45,504
Who are you talking to?

1012
00:54:45,506 --> 00:54:46,738
[Edwin] I gotta go.

1013
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:49,041
[Flake] Oh I'll
talk to him alright.

1014
00:54:49,043 --> 00:54:50,642
You think he would really do it?

1015
00:54:50,644 --> 00:54:52,244
I gotta go, okay.

1016
00:54:52,246 --> 00:54:53,879
[Flake] What's wrong?

1017
00:54:53,881 --> 00:54:54,979
[Janice] Is that Roddy?

1018
00:54:54,981 --> 00:54:56,749
[Flake] Is that your mom?

1019
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:58,216
Yeah.

1020
00:54:58,218 --> 00:54:59,885
[Flake] Has she been
listening this whole time?

1021
00:54:59,887 --> 00:55:00,722
No.

1022
00:55:01,856 --> 00:55:04,689
Jesus Christ, call
me back asshole.

1023
00:55:04,691 --> 00:55:08,160
(phone hangs up)

1024
00:55:08,162 --> 00:55:08,997
Yeah?

1025
00:55:12,099 --> 00:55:15,200
[Janice] So you and
Roddy worked things out?

1026
00:55:15,202 --> 00:55:16,037
Yeah.

1027
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:21,273
(sighs)

1028
00:55:21,275 --> 00:55:25,447
Look, I was thinking that

1029
00:55:26,847 --> 00:55:28,747
we should go away somewhere
for your dad's birthday.

1030
00:55:28,749 --> 00:55:30,785
Like somewhere cool, and...

1031
00:55:32,419 --> 00:55:35,254
I don't know, how
does that sound?

1032
00:55:35,256 --> 00:55:36,191
Sounds good.

1033
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:38,425
Sounds good?

1034
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:40,095
Okay.

1035
00:55:40,994 --> 00:55:44,131
So where do you wanna go?

1036
00:55:47,034 --> 00:55:48,169
The lake.

1037
00:55:49,936 --> 00:55:51,972
Yeah, where we used
to spend summer.

1038
00:55:52,872 --> 00:55:54,041
The lake?

1039
00:55:55,809 --> 00:55:58,142
That's great, yeah. The lake.

1040
00:55:58,144 --> 00:56:00,879
Okay. Oh that's gonna be...

1041
00:56:00,881 --> 00:56:02,347
Let's take the sailboat.

1042
00:56:02,349 --> 00:56:04,115
We haven't taken
it out for so long.

1043
00:56:04,117 --> 00:56:05,651
(laughs)

1044
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:09,224
You and your brother used
to just have so much fun.

1045
00:56:10,423 --> 00:56:12,092
That's such a good
choice, hon. Okay.

1046
00:56:15,695 --> 00:56:17,930
[Edwin] You can
leave the door open.

1047
00:56:17,932 --> 00:56:18,967
I'm gonna...

1048
00:56:20,733 --> 00:56:23,237
(door closes)

1049
00:56:26,706 --> 00:56:29,109
(chattering)

1050
00:56:34,414 --> 00:56:37,418
[Herman] It's the kid
in the blue sweatshirt.

1051
00:56:39,385 --> 00:56:40,554
[Flake] Him?

1052
00:56:46,994 --> 00:56:49,329
(rap music)

1053
00:56:52,032 --> 00:56:54,102
[Budzinski] Boom, 21, losers.

1054
00:56:55,635 --> 00:56:56,470
Whoa.

1055
00:57:00,974 --> 00:57:02,309
See ya guys.

1056
00:57:03,276 --> 00:57:05,947
So, what do we
do now, exactly?

1057
00:57:11,285 --> 00:57:12,550
[Budzinski] Hey
see you guys later.

1058
00:57:12,552 --> 00:57:14,119
Oh, don't forget about
that game Wednesday.

1059
00:57:14,121 --> 00:57:15,789
We need to win this.

1060
00:57:22,061 --> 00:57:23,896
[Flake] Working on
some construction?

1061
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:25,497
What do you want?

1062
00:57:25,499 --> 00:57:27,869
So listen, you
know that kid Herman?

1063
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:31,102
About your size?

1064
00:57:31,104 --> 00:57:32,637
Yeah.

1065
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:34,673
We're thinking... well, we
watch out for him sometimes.

1066
00:57:34,675 --> 00:57:36,173
He's such a doofy little shit.

1067
00:57:36,175 --> 00:57:37,776
[Budzinski] You
got that right.

1068
00:57:37,778 --> 00:57:40,579
Yeah, he can really be a
pain in the ass sometimes.

1069
00:57:40,581 --> 00:57:42,517
Yeah, you got that right too.

1070
00:57:45,485 --> 00:57:48,620
(chuckles) We were hoping
you could cut him some slack

1071
00:57:48,622 --> 00:57:50,021
the next few weeks.

1072
00:57:50,023 --> 00:57:51,291
Why should I?

1073
00:57:53,059 --> 00:57:55,126
'Cause if you don't
we'll kick your ass.

1074
00:57:55,128 --> 00:57:57,262
[Budzinski] I'll
kick your ass, bitch.

1075
00:57:57,264 --> 00:57:59,367
Is the whole 7th
grade fucking nuts?

1076
00:58:00,133 --> 00:58:01,099
Get outta my yard.

1077
00:58:01,101 --> 00:58:01,936
Mom!

1078
00:58:02,836 --> 00:58:04,535
[Mom] What's the matter?

1079
00:58:04,537 --> 00:58:05,970
[Budzinski] Get outta
my yard, mother fucker.

1080
00:58:05,972 --> 00:58:07,905
We tried to ask
you nicely, dude.

1081
00:58:07,907 --> 00:58:09,140
Hi Mom, what's up?

1082
00:58:09,142 --> 00:58:10,142
Okay I'm calling
the police if you two

1083
00:58:10,144 --> 00:58:11,642
- don't get outta my yard.
- Go!

1084
00:58:11,644 --> 00:58:13,211
[Flake] Call the police. Call
the fucking National Guard.

1085
00:58:13,213 --> 00:58:14,912
[Mom] Whoa, whoa, whoa, you
don't talk to me like that.

1086
00:58:14,914 --> 00:58:15,948
What are your names?

1087
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,515
I'm Ed Gein.

1088
00:58:17,517 --> 00:58:20,218
Tell the police Ed Gein was
here and he wants your son.

1089
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:21,119
[Mom] Get outta my yard.

1090
00:58:21,121 --> 00:58:22,521
You inside.

1091
00:58:22,523 --> 00:58:23,457
Let's go.

1092
00:58:25,959 --> 00:58:28,795
[Flake] Now he's really
gonna go after Hermie.

1093
00:58:30,197 --> 00:58:32,530
We gotta figure out the
doors and move up our plan.

1094
00:58:32,532 --> 00:58:34,332
[Edwin] I know.

1095
00:58:34,334 --> 00:58:37,468
[Flake] We should do it
during the next assembly.

1096
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:40,108
I think there's one
in the gym on Friday.

1097
00:58:42,575 --> 00:58:45,780
(somber music)

1098
00:58:51,251 --> 00:58:54,322
I think there's something
wrong with my tooth.

1099
00:59:03,063 --> 00:59:06,099
I could see it in
the news afterwards.

1100
00:59:07,834 --> 00:59:10,801
The two, murderous

1101
00:59:10,803 --> 00:59:13,106
juvenile delinquents

1102
00:59:14,407 --> 00:59:16,410
and their whatever plan.

1103
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:23,985
You wuss out on me,
I'll shoot you myself.

1104
00:59:24,584 --> 00:59:26,320
(chuckles)

1105
00:59:26,919 --> 00:59:29,356
(eerie music)

1106
01:00:51,472 --> 01:00:52,473
I got it.

1107
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,075
A wedge.

1108
01:00:56,510 --> 01:00:57,345
What?

1109
01:00:58,311 --> 01:00:59,244
What the fuck's with you?

1110
01:00:59,246 --> 01:01:01,381
Am I doing this alone here?

1111
01:01:06,586 --> 01:01:07,852
A wedge?

1112
01:01:07,854 --> 01:01:09,887
Wedges, to seal up the doors.

1113
01:01:09,889 --> 01:01:11,622
We use wedges.

1114
01:01:11,624 --> 01:01:12,923
We do it from the outside.

1115
01:01:12,925 --> 01:01:14,358
One of us brings a
little hammer, bang,

1116
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,128
we drive it under the doors.

1117
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:19,164
No one from the
inside can open them.

1118
01:01:19,166 --> 01:01:22,733
God, I can't believe I
didn't think of that before.

1119
01:01:22,735 --> 01:01:25,939
I can't believe even you
didn't think of them.

1120
01:01:29,142 --> 01:01:32,813
So, does this mean
we can do it on Friday?

1121
01:01:43,322 --> 01:01:45,222
[Flake's Mom] Roddy, homework.

1122
01:01:45,224 --> 01:01:46,727
He's just going.

1123
01:01:48,427 --> 01:01:51,629
Do we know how much
kick these guns have?

1124
01:01:51,631 --> 01:01:54,399
Don't hold it like a
faggot and you'll be fine.

1125
01:01:54,401 --> 01:01:56,501
I'm not gonna hold
it like a faggot.

1126
01:01:56,503 --> 01:01:58,269
[Flake] Then you'll be fine.

1127
01:01:58,271 --> 01:02:00,307
Look, you better go, dude.

1128
01:02:01,775 --> 01:02:03,975
What about the
thing with Hermie?

1129
01:02:03,977 --> 01:02:05,443
[Flake] I don't know,
we gotta stall him.

1130
01:02:05,445 --> 01:02:06,847
Let me think about it.

1131
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:24,863
[Edwin] Where's Gus?

1132
01:02:24,865 --> 01:02:26,700
Being a sleepy head.

1133
01:02:28,735 --> 01:02:32,439
So, you wanna hear my plan?

1134
01:02:32,939 --> 01:02:33,775
Plan?

1135
01:02:35,342 --> 01:02:36,778
What's your plan?

1136
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:40,144
We go to the
lake this weekend.

1137
01:02:40,146 --> 01:02:41,912
It's supposed to
be in the 70s so

1138
01:02:41,914 --> 01:02:45,816
the water should still be warm
enough for you guys to swim.

1139
01:02:45,818 --> 01:02:49,990
Take the sailboat, you
know, just like old times.

1140
01:02:50,858 --> 01:02:51,655
Sounds like a good idea.

1141
01:02:51,657 --> 01:02:53,124
Yeah?

1142
01:02:53,126 --> 01:02:55,492
Well, I say we pick your
father up after his lecture

1143
01:02:55,494 --> 01:02:58,329
on Friday and just go
straight from there.

1144
01:02:58,331 --> 01:03:00,131
When's his lecture end?

1145
01:03:00,133 --> 01:03:01,968
[Janice] Like 10 or so.

1146
01:03:05,539 --> 01:03:06,470
Friday?

1147
01:03:06,472 --> 01:03:08,974
[Janice] Yeah, this Friday.

1148
01:03:08,976 --> 01:03:10,408
I got school.

1149
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:12,142
Well, we'll take
you out early.

1150
01:03:12,144 --> 01:03:15,012
It's like a get out
of jail free card.

1151
01:03:15,014 --> 01:03:16,847
(chuckles) Come on.

1152
01:03:16,849 --> 01:03:19,753
I mean unless you're
dying to stay in school.

1153
01:03:23,523 --> 01:03:25,457
Are you excited?

1154
01:03:25,459 --> 01:03:26,691
[Edwin] I guess.

1155
01:03:26,693 --> 01:03:29,397
You're gonna be
late, hon, come on.

1156
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:37,871
(students chattering)

1157
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:43,110
Are those lights
on your shoes?

1158
01:03:45,311 --> 01:03:46,278
What happened to your eye?

1159
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,711
Walk into somebody's boner?

1160
01:03:47,713 --> 01:03:48,548
No.

1161
01:03:50,182 --> 01:03:53,617
So, did we tell you
we talked to Budzinski?

1162
01:03:53,619 --> 01:03:55,021
Oh, he told me.

1163
01:03:58,057 --> 01:03:59,459
Did he do that?

1164
01:04:04,932 --> 01:04:06,167
Son of a bitch.

1165
01:04:07,367 --> 01:04:08,733
I'm gonna talk to
that little prick.

1166
01:04:08,735 --> 01:04:12,003
Just don't talk
to him anymore.

1167
01:04:12,005 --> 01:04:14,773
[Flake] Well, he can't
just keep beating on you.

1168
01:04:14,775 --> 01:04:16,573
Don't worry about me.

1169
01:04:16,575 --> 01:04:18,678
I'll figure it out myself.

1170
01:04:20,447 --> 01:04:24,048
So, listen, we got this plan

1171
01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:25,916
but it's gonna take
some time to set up

1172
01:04:25,918 --> 01:04:28,355
so it's gonna have
to start next week.

1173
01:04:29,423 --> 01:04:31,055
You in?

1174
01:04:31,057 --> 01:04:32,323
In what?

1175
01:04:32,325 --> 01:04:33,524
In on this thing.

1176
01:04:33,526 --> 01:04:36,831
You wanna, you wanna
get back at him or not?

1177
01:04:39,198 --> 01:04:40,133
Whatever.

1178
01:04:43,403 --> 01:04:44,906
Alright, then.

1179
01:04:46,273 --> 01:04:48,409
(students chattering)

1180
01:04:49,008 --> 01:04:51,111
(solemn music)

1181
01:05:01,854 --> 01:05:02,923
Hey Edwin.

1182
01:05:04,057 --> 01:05:05,392
Congratulations.

1183
01:05:06,425 --> 01:05:07,325
It's so exciting.

1184
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,763
[Edwin] Thanks.

1185
01:05:10,229 --> 01:05:12,530
You know if you win
the regional prize,

1186
01:05:12,532 --> 01:05:14,798
you get your name in the paper.

1187
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,001
Did you ever wonder
what it would be like

1188
01:05:16,003 --> 01:05:17,702
to see your name in the paper?

1189
01:05:17,704 --> 01:05:19,204
[Edwin] Yeah.

1190
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:22,142
(chuckles) Well, did you
ever think it might happen?

1191
01:05:22,742 --> 01:05:24,041
[Edwin] Yeah.

1192
01:05:24,043 --> 01:05:26,010
Well, go tell your parents.

1193
01:05:26,012 --> 01:05:27,778
It's a really big honor.

1194
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:29,881
You know, I mean
just to get this far.

1195
01:05:29,883 --> 01:05:33,287
It's great that it was
a group project too.

1196
01:05:35,454 --> 01:05:36,320
I guess.

1197
01:05:36,322 --> 01:05:37,157
Yeah.

1198
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,063
Okay, well see you later.

1199
01:06:41,887 --> 01:06:43,957
Hey, throw the ball.

1200
01:06:46,959 --> 01:06:47,794
Thanks.

1201
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,175
Hey.

1202
01:07:35,842 --> 01:07:36,677
Hey.

1203
01:07:38,311 --> 01:07:39,943
What the fuck?

1204
01:07:39,945 --> 01:07:41,646
[Man] What did you say?

1205
01:07:41,648 --> 01:07:42,916
It's my ball.

1206
01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:46,619
No, what did you say to me?

1207
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:50,123
I said I don't
fucking believe this.

1208
01:07:57,530 --> 01:07:59,933
You're just gonna
steal my fucking ball?

1209
01:08:05,939 --> 01:08:07,274
[Man] Come on.

1210
01:08:08,675 --> 01:08:10,408
It's not even mine.

1211
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:12,480
It's my little brother's.

1212
01:08:13,914 --> 01:08:16,317
You hear me, you fuck?

1213
01:08:27,227 --> 01:08:28,062
Whoo.

1214
01:08:32,064 --> 01:08:35,199
Oh, these old guys.

1215
01:08:35,201 --> 01:08:37,168
These are about ready
to go out, aren't they?

1216
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:38,906
[Edwin] Leave them.

1217
01:08:41,907 --> 01:08:43,373
Hon, I think we
can try to find you

1218
01:08:43,375 --> 01:08:44,676
another pair like them.

1219
01:08:44,678 --> 01:08:45,946
They're fine.

1220
01:08:48,113 --> 01:08:50,582
(cries)

1221
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:52,318
Why are you crying?

1222
01:08:55,287 --> 01:08:56,520
Hey.

1223
01:08:56,522 --> 01:08:58,756
[Edwin] Bit my tongue.

1224
01:08:58,758 --> 01:09:00,158
[Janice] Really?

1225
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:02,126
Okay, let me see.

1226
01:09:02,128 --> 01:09:03,496
Open your mouth.

1227
01:09:04,397 --> 01:09:05,399
Let me look.

1228
01:09:06,866 --> 01:09:09,132
Well, I can't tell if you
won't let me look at it.

1229
01:09:09,134 --> 01:09:10,735
It's on the bottom.

1230
01:09:10,737 --> 01:09:13,974
Okay, I'll be back
in a minute, okay?

1231
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:29,052
[Gus] Where's my ball?

1232
01:09:29,054 --> 01:09:30,587
[Janice] What?

1233
01:09:30,589 --> 01:09:32,159
[Gus] Where's my ball?

1234
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:35,196
[Janice] You left
it outside I think.

1235
01:09:36,161 --> 01:09:37,595
[Gus] I want it.

1236
01:09:37,597 --> 01:09:39,529
[Janice] Didn't
you leave it outside?

1237
01:09:39,531 --> 01:09:41,034
[Gus] I want it.

1238
01:09:42,201 --> 01:09:43,301
[Janice] Well,
it's too late now.

1239
01:09:43,303 --> 01:09:44,534
We can't get it tonight.

1240
01:09:44,536 --> 01:09:46,703
Please, hon, just go
get ready for bed.

1241
01:09:46,705 --> 01:09:47,907
[Gus] No.

1242
01:09:49,576 --> 01:09:50,678
[Janice] Edwin?

1243
01:09:52,812 --> 01:09:55,381
(cries) I'm under here now.

1244
01:10:00,687 --> 01:10:03,424
Are we sleeping under
the bed tonight or...

1245
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:06,893
Just lying here a minute.

1246
01:10:10,463 --> 01:10:12,700
Can I ask you a question?

1247
01:10:13,599 --> 01:10:15,001
[Edwin] Uh huh.

1248
01:10:16,736 --> 01:10:18,238
What's going on?

1249
01:10:19,406 --> 01:10:20,908
[Edwin] Nothing.

1250
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:26,711
Well, you know I'm
talking to a bed here, hon,

1251
01:10:26,713 --> 01:10:29,250
so there's obviously
something wrong.

1252
01:10:30,049 --> 01:10:32,652
(Edwin crying)

1253
01:10:37,857 --> 01:10:38,692
Hon.

1254
01:10:39,858 --> 01:10:41,195
What's the matter?

1255
01:10:45,698 --> 01:10:47,664
Hurt my face.

1256
01:10:47,666 --> 01:10:49,503
[Janice] What'd you do?

1257
01:10:51,804 --> 01:10:53,539
Rubbed it too hard.

1258
01:10:56,241 --> 01:11:00,079
Honey, come, Edwin
come on, come out please.

1259
01:11:06,753 --> 01:11:07,588
Oh hon.

1260
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:14,260
Come here, come here.

1261
01:11:14,994 --> 01:11:16,397
Honey, it's okay.

1262
01:11:17,597 --> 01:11:19,032
[Edwin] What is?

1263
01:11:20,834 --> 01:11:23,801
Whatever it is, you know.

1264
01:11:23,803 --> 01:11:26,770
I know that sometimes you
just can't handle stuff.

1265
01:11:26,772 --> 01:11:28,338
It's too hard.

1266
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:29,843
I can handle it.

1267
01:11:31,044 --> 01:11:32,877
Please don't go
getting all mad, okay?

1268
01:11:32,879 --> 01:11:34,878
I'm trying to talk to you.

1269
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,718
What are, what are you mad for?

1270
01:11:39,251 --> 01:11:40,584
You're just a little guy.

1271
01:11:40,586 --> 01:11:41,688
You should...

1272
01:11:42,921 --> 01:11:43,956
(door slamming)

1273
01:11:45,224 --> 01:11:46,059
(Janice sighs)

1274
01:11:47,192 --> 01:11:49,530
(solemn music)

1275
01:11:53,832 --> 01:11:56,266
(water lapping)

1276
01:11:56,268 --> 01:11:59,606
(wind in sail)

1277
01:12:15,522 --> 01:12:17,989
Gus, please come up and
just eat some cereal.

1278
01:12:17,991 --> 01:12:19,222
(Gus crying)

1279
01:12:19,224 --> 01:12:22,360
Ah, so a nice way
to start the day.

1280
01:12:22,362 --> 01:12:23,694
[Janice] Don't make fun
of him, though, please.

1281
01:12:23,696 --> 01:12:26,463
I'm not making fun of
him, I'm just commenting

1282
01:12:26,465 --> 01:12:28,498
on our happy home.

1283
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:29,333
He didn't find his ball?

1284
01:12:29,335 --> 01:12:30,267
[Janice] No.

1285
01:12:30,269 --> 01:12:31,068
[Tim] You look outside?

1286
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:32,302
You look outside?

1287
01:12:32,304 --> 01:12:33,904
Mmm hmm, he said
he looked all over.

1288
01:12:33,906 --> 01:12:36,543
[Gus] I looked all over.

1289
01:12:37,544 --> 01:12:38,575
I know, hon.

1290
01:12:38,577 --> 01:12:39,409
It's not the end of the world.

1291
01:12:39,411 --> 01:12:40,981
[Gus] Yes it is.

1292
01:12:42,881 --> 01:12:44,347
[Tim] How are you doing?

1293
01:12:44,349 --> 01:12:45,983
I'm good.

1294
01:12:45,985 --> 01:12:46,818
[Tim] You look great.

1295
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:49,287
(Gus whining)

1296
01:12:49,289 --> 01:12:51,422
And the Oscar goes to... Gus.

1297
01:12:51,424 --> 01:12:52,957
[Janice] He's so sad.

1298
01:12:52,959 --> 01:12:54,324
I think I know
where his ball is.

1299
01:12:54,326 --> 01:12:55,258
[Janice] Really?

1300
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:56,828
[Gus] Where, you got it?

1301
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:58,529
Flake borrowed it, I think.

1302
01:12:58,531 --> 01:12:59,463
[Tim] Flake, of course.

1303
01:12:59,465 --> 01:13:00,597
Yeah, I'll just get it back.

1304
01:13:00,599 --> 01:13:01,632
[Janice] That's good news.

1305
01:13:01,634 --> 01:13:02,867
[Tim] Yeah.

1306
01:13:02,869 --> 01:13:04,401
Things are looking
up for you, Gus.

1307
01:13:04,403 --> 01:13:06,639
[Edwin] I'll
get it, I promise.

1308
01:13:09,308 --> 01:13:11,611
[Tim] Big brother
coming through.

1309
01:13:16,448 --> 01:13:19,052
Hey, the assembly is tomorrow.

1310
01:13:21,054 --> 01:13:23,354
Um, I gotta go to the
dentist after school

1311
01:13:23,356 --> 01:13:25,655
so I'll call you after dinner.

1312
01:13:25,657 --> 01:13:27,091
My mom thinks I'm
gonna be getting braces

1313
01:13:27,093 --> 01:13:29,459
in the next few months.

1314
01:13:29,461 --> 01:13:32,363
I don't think that's
gonna work out.

1315
01:13:32,365 --> 01:13:34,768
(students chattering)

1316
01:13:37,303 --> 01:13:40,941
(Edwin gagging)

1317
01:13:43,876 --> 01:13:48,048
(Edwin panting)

1318
01:13:50,482 --> 01:13:51,584
(Edwin coughing)

1319
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:56,088
You okay, Edwin?

1320
01:13:59,526 --> 01:14:01,495
Yeah, I got sick.

1321
01:14:03,028 --> 01:14:05,495
Yeah, that's what I heard.

1322
01:14:05,497 --> 01:14:06,500
You okay?

1323
01:14:09,035 --> 01:14:12,872
So, um, what's
the class doing?

1324
01:14:13,939 --> 01:14:16,276
I gave them an assignment.

1325
01:14:19,745 --> 01:14:21,647
Sorry I'm missing it.

1326
01:14:23,415 --> 01:14:27,153
Okay, well, I just
wanted to check on you.

1327
01:14:38,798 --> 01:14:42,600
[Edwin] Um, excuse me,
you have any other colors?

1328
01:14:42,602 --> 01:14:44,872
Sorry, guy, that's all we got.

1329
01:15:01,254 --> 01:15:04,858
(phone ringing)

1330
01:15:07,794 --> 01:15:09,226
(sighs) Was his ball pink?

1331
01:15:09,228 --> 01:15:10,560
He says it wasn't.

1332
01:15:10,562 --> 01:15:12,096
[Edwin] It was.

1333
01:15:12,098 --> 01:15:13,029
He's losing his mind.

1334
01:15:13,031 --> 01:15:14,230
[Flake] Hello?

1335
01:15:14,232 --> 01:15:15,032
[Janice] He says
it was, honey.

1336
01:15:15,034 --> 01:15:16,367
[Gus] It wasn't pink.

1337
01:15:16,369 --> 01:15:17,834
[Flake] You there?

1338
01:15:17,836 --> 01:15:18,769
[Janice] I like the pink.
You don't like the pink?

1339
01:15:18,771 --> 01:15:20,538
[Flake] Are you all right?

1340
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:21,404
You're panting.

1341
01:15:21,406 --> 01:15:22,373
You sound like a dog.

1342
01:15:22,375 --> 01:15:25,045
(Edwin panting)

1343
01:15:26,179 --> 01:15:27,944
I'm scared.

1344
01:15:27,946 --> 01:15:29,913
[Flake] Don't wuss out on me.

1345
01:15:29,915 --> 01:15:30,948
Do you hear me?

1346
01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:33,284
I'm not wussing out on anyone.

1347
01:15:33,286 --> 01:15:34,784
[Flake] Shit,
dude, are you crying?

1348
01:15:34,786 --> 01:15:35,720
No!

1349
01:15:35,722 --> 01:15:36,953
[Flake] Are you gonna make it?

1350
01:15:36,955 --> 01:15:38,689
Do I have to come over
there and sit with you?

1351
01:15:38,691 --> 01:15:39,526
No!

1352
01:15:40,793 --> 01:15:43,260
[Flake] Dude, we got
a lot to do tonight.

1353
01:15:43,262 --> 01:15:45,930
How soon can you come over
after everybody's asleep there?

1354
01:15:45,932 --> 01:15:47,297
1:00, 1:30?

1355
01:15:47,299 --> 01:15:48,632
Yeah.

1356
01:15:48,634 --> 01:15:50,534
[Flake] Which?

1357
01:15:50,536 --> 01:15:51,370
1:30.

1358
01:15:52,571 --> 01:15:55,405
[Flake] All right,
come to the gate.

1359
01:15:55,407 --> 01:15:56,375
(phone hangs up)

1360
01:16:01,013 --> 01:16:03,516
You have a fight with Roddy?

1361
01:16:05,018 --> 01:16:08,519
Just wanted to see if he
wanted to play volleyball.

1362
01:16:08,521 --> 01:16:11,388
Yeah well, I packed a bag
for you for the trip tomorrow.

1363
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:13,893
Let me know if I
missed anything.

1364
01:16:25,905 --> 01:16:28,275
(wind rustling)

1365
01:16:34,513 --> 01:16:37,617
(crickets chirping)

1366
01:16:44,624 --> 01:16:47,861
(gate creaks)

1367
01:16:49,327 --> 01:16:52,232
(clicking)

1368
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:56,367
[Edwin] Are you
worried your dad's

1369
01:16:56,369 --> 01:16:57,838
gonna know they're missing?

1370
01:16:59,037 --> 01:17:00,270
[Flake] I locked
the cases back up

1371
01:17:00,272 --> 01:17:02,573
and I left the pistols, so...

1372
01:17:02,575 --> 01:17:05,845
(clicking)

1373
01:17:10,849 --> 01:17:13,184
[Edwin] This is really heavy.

1374
01:17:13,186 --> 01:17:15,889
Hold it farther
up with that hand.

1375
01:17:18,724 --> 01:17:20,559
You want to trade?

1376
01:17:21,527 --> 01:17:23,397
[Edwin] Yeah, maybe.

1377
01:17:26,965 --> 01:17:27,765
[Flake] You want a tube?

1378
01:17:27,767 --> 01:17:28,998
I brought two down.

1379
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,102
I'm fine.

1380
01:17:38,777 --> 01:17:42,581
You ever worry we might
shoot all the wrong people?

1381
01:17:44,383 --> 01:17:47,019
(bays)

1382
01:17:52,390 --> 01:17:55,062
You want to know
what I think about?

1383
01:17:56,362 --> 01:17:59,433
How when something
terrible happens somewhere,

1384
01:18:00,633 --> 01:18:04,403
and there's all those
flags and flowers and

1385
01:18:05,604 --> 01:18:08,474
candles and pictures
of people who died,

1386
01:18:09,509 --> 01:18:12,212
and pages of sayings and poems.

1387
01:18:15,447 --> 01:18:18,384
All that shit lined
up for months.

1388
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:23,789
That's what I think about.

1389
01:18:29,128 --> 01:18:32,631
(soft music)

1390
01:18:50,448 --> 01:18:51,382
Are you kidding me?

1391
01:18:51,384 --> 01:18:53,453
They haven't fixed this shit?

1392
01:18:54,387 --> 01:18:55,222
(loud thud)

1393
01:18:56,822 --> 01:18:59,892
(soft music)

1394
01:19:25,817 --> 01:19:28,487
(locker handle clattering)

1395
01:19:33,526 --> 01:19:35,095
What's your combo?

1396
01:19:35,995 --> 01:19:38,031
- What's your...
- 4, 17, 23.

1397
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:40,901
(soft music)

1398
01:20:30,415 --> 01:20:32,084
(floor creaks)

1399
01:20:33,486 --> 01:20:35,689
What are you doing?

1400
01:20:36,388 --> 01:20:37,656
(shushes)

1401
01:20:41,326 --> 01:20:43,162
Is Mommy up?

1402
01:20:43,896 --> 01:20:45,165
No, Mommy's sleeping.

1403
01:20:50,036 --> 01:20:52,672
You go to sleep too, okay?

1404
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:57,277
You like your Nerf ball?

1405
01:20:58,009 --> 01:21:00,446
Yeah, this one's pink.

1406
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:07,519
Don't be sad.

1407
01:21:10,889 --> 01:21:13,923
That's what everyone says.

1408
01:21:13,925 --> 01:21:16,263
Why does everyone say that?

1409
01:21:18,763 --> 01:21:21,034
I just get so mad sometimes.

1410
01:21:21,901 --> 01:21:25,472
(soft music)

1411
01:21:31,009 --> 01:21:32,811
How's your ear?

1412
01:21:33,912 --> 01:21:35,913
Mom says it's still
bothering you.

1413
01:21:35,915 --> 01:21:37,717
It hurts.

1414
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:41,454
[Edwin] How about now?

1415
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:43,622
No.

1416
01:21:46,858 --> 01:21:47,826
Okay.

1417
01:21:49,394 --> 01:21:50,828
Go to sleep.

1418
01:21:50,830 --> 01:21:51,861
[Gus] Goodnight.

1419
01:21:51,863 --> 01:21:53,433
Goodnight, Gus.

1420
01:21:56,134 --> 01:21:57,967
You're a great little
guy, you know that?

1421
01:21:57,969 --> 01:21:59,071
[Gus] Yeah.

1422
01:22:00,805 --> 01:22:02,776
Leave the door open.

1423
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:05,378
[Edwin] Okay.

1424
01:22:09,781 --> 01:22:11,116
Hey, wake up.

1425
01:22:12,351 --> 01:22:13,385
Let's go.

1426
01:22:16,522 --> 01:22:19,359
Hey. Gosh, you are so out.

1427
01:22:20,492 --> 01:22:23,193
Hey, I have some errands
to run this morning,

1428
01:22:23,195 --> 01:22:25,061
so I won't be by
the school until

1429
01:22:25,063 --> 01:22:26,832
quarter to 12 or so.

1430
01:22:31,504 --> 01:22:32,836
Hey.

1431
01:22:32,838 --> 01:22:34,404
Be where I said today, okay?

1432
01:22:34,406 --> 01:22:35,939
Don't make us come all
around the building

1433
01:22:35,941 --> 01:22:37,740
looking for you.

1434
01:22:37,742 --> 01:22:38,678
I won't.

1435
01:22:42,814 --> 01:22:44,547
Where's Dad?

1436
01:22:44,549 --> 01:22:48,354
[Janice] Oh, he went in
early to practice his thing.

1437
01:22:52,590 --> 01:22:54,794
Tell him I said good luck.

1438
01:22:55,527 --> 01:22:57,062
[Janice] Aw, okay.

1439
01:23:51,584 --> 01:23:53,420
[Student] Do it again,
do it again. (laughs)

1440
01:23:53,885 --> 01:23:54,687
Yeah?

1441
01:23:57,022 --> 01:23:57,954
Hey.

1442
01:23:57,956 --> 01:23:59,858
- (snickers)
- Hey.

1443
01:24:03,394 --> 01:24:05,631
(laughing)

1444
01:24:07,066 --> 01:24:10,070
(eerie music)

1445
01:24:28,786 --> 01:24:31,790
(muffled chatter)

1446
01:24:35,561 --> 01:24:37,030
Edwin.

1447
01:24:38,630 --> 01:24:40,062
You're gonna go to
the bathroom, alright?

1448
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:41,265
And you're gonna wait
there until the bell rings.

1449
01:24:41,267 --> 01:24:42,699
Do not go out until
the bell rings.

1450
01:24:42,701 --> 01:24:43,967
Go to your locker,
get the duffle,

1451
01:24:43,969 --> 01:24:45,034
bring the whole thing
to the doors, alright?

1452
01:24:45,036 --> 01:24:46,369
I will take care of the wedge.

1453
01:24:46,371 --> 01:24:48,105
Do not go in until you see me

1454
01:24:48,107 --> 01:24:49,739
at the double doors, alright?

1455
01:24:49,741 --> 01:24:51,807
We are going to go at
the same time, alright?

1456
01:24:51,809 --> 01:24:54,780
Do not go before I go,
go when I go. Okay?

1457
01:24:55,481 --> 01:24:56,316
Okay?

1458
01:24:56,781 --> 01:24:57,316
Okay.

1459
01:25:00,486 --> 01:25:03,256

1460
01:25:04,322 --> 01:25:05,556

(locker clatters)

1472
01:26:24,737 --> 01:26:26,168
Hey, Edwin.

1473
01:26:26,170 --> 01:26:27,973
What are you doing?

1474
01:26:30,742 --> 01:26:32,909
You're gonna be so late, here.

1475
01:26:32,911 --> 01:26:34,814
What's your combination?

1476
01:26:38,082 --> 01:26:39,751
4, 17, 23.

1477

(locker clattering)

1478
01:26:50,062 --> 01:26:51,261
Thanks.

1479
01:26:51,263 --> 01:26:53,600
Whatever, you're
gonna be late.

(muffled speaking)

1482
01:27:50,421 --> 01:27:51,954
[Speaker] Because
today is not the end,

1483
01:27:51,956 --> 01:27:53,457
it is the beginning.

1484
01:27:53,459 --> 01:27:54,858
Individually, many
of you perform

1485
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:56,763
with the best of your ability...

1486
01:27:57,595 --> 01:27:58,497
Hey.

1487
01:28:00,064 --> 01:28:01,263
Safety.

1488
01:28:01,265 --> 01:28:03,201
Turn the safety off.

1489
01:28:04,068 --> 01:28:08,240
(heavy breathing)

1490
01:28:10,808 --> 01:28:14,346
(muffled speaking)

1491
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:19,749

(gunshots)

1493
01:28:30,763 --> 01:28:32,596
Shoot your gun!

1494
01:28:32,598 --> 01:28:35,335
Shoot your fucking
gun, shoot it!

1495
01:28:37,335 --> 01:28:38,702
Fire it!

1496
01:28:38,704 --> 01:28:42,875
(gunshots)
(screaming)

1497
01:28:45,744 --> 01:28:48,915
(somber music)

1498
01:28:49,514 --> 01:28:50,615
Oh my God!

Put the gun down!

1500
01:29:00,793 --> 01:29:04,964

1501
01:29:06,365 --> 01:29:07,830
[Teacher] Get down.
Get the gun, get the gun!

1502
01:29:07,832 --> 01:29:09,865
(yelling)

1503
01:29:09,867 --> 01:29:11,937
Flake, no!

1504
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:13,305
Fuck!

1505
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:16,873
- [Teacher] Stop it!
- No, Flake!

1506
01:29:16,875 --> 01:29:18,341
[Teacher] Hey,
get out, get out!

1507
01:29:18,343 --> 01:29:19,943
(running, screaming)

1508
01:29:19,945 --> 01:29:20,976
- [Woman] Go, move!
- [Teacher] Settle down!

1509
01:29:20,978 --> 01:29:24,513
No, fuck! Let me go! Flake!

1510
01:29:24,515 --> 01:29:25,882
No! (sobbing)

1511
01:29:25,884 --> 01:29:27,784
Flake! Flake!

1512
01:29:27,786 --> 01:29:29,418
[Teacher] Don't move!

1513
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:31,454
- Flake!
- [Teacher] Don't move!

1514
01:29:31,456 --> 01:29:33,155
- Let me go, fuck!
- [Teacher] Don't move!

1515
01:29:33,157 --> 01:29:36,159
(yelling, running)

1516
01:29:36,161 --> 01:29:37,029
[Edwin] Flake!

1517
01:29:37,963 --> 01:29:38,898
Flake!

1518
01:29:40,131 --> 01:29:40,963
Fuck!

1519
01:29:40,965 --> 01:29:45,070
(sobbing)

1520
01:29:47,939 --> 01:29:48,775
Flake.

1521
01:29:51,108 --> 01:29:53,713
No. Flake.

1522
01:29:54,312 --> 01:29:57,883
(soft music)

1523
01:30:31,683 --> 01:30:33,516
[Edwin Voiceover] Every
weekend in the summer,

1524
01:30:33,518 --> 01:30:34,985
we used to take this
old dumpy sailboat

1525
01:30:34,987 --> 01:30:36,322
out onto the lake.

1526
01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:44,564
It looked like a dog
dish with a mast.

1527
01:30:46,497 --> 01:30:49,332
And this one time, we
gave this guy and his kid

1528
01:30:49,334 --> 01:30:50,803
in a Sunfish a tow.

1529
01:30:52,771 --> 01:30:54,003
I got to be the guy
who threw the rope

1530
01:30:54,005 --> 01:30:56,575
when we were close
enough to them.

1531
01:30:59,777 --> 01:31:03,882
(soft music)

1532
01:31:10,522 --> 01:31:13,556
I remember when we got
home, telling my parents

1533
01:31:13,558 --> 01:31:15,592
how great I thought it was.

1534
01:31:15,594 --> 01:31:18,898
I remember my mom
agreeing with me.

1535
01:31:21,133 --> 01:31:22,298
I remember the kid's face

1536
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:24,202
as we bounced
through some waves.

1537
01:31:26,138 --> 01:31:28,307
I remember how happy he was.

1538
01:31:31,777 --> 01:31:33,079
And I thought,

1539
01:31:34,245 --> 01:31:35,945
good for you, kid.

1540
01:31:35,947 --> 01:31:37,517
Like I was his dad.

1541
01:31:38,549 --> 01:31:39,619
Good for you.

1542
01:31:54,832 --> 01:31:58,970
(water lapping)

1543
01:32:19,390 --> 01:32:23,495
(somber music)
