my goddamn fucking story.
Please don't use that language.

179

This kid is going home.

180
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:29,353
CHERYL: Yes. Hopefully, he
will be going home, and hopefully

181
00:09:29,386 --> 00:09:31,698
you will be going home as well. RYAN:
Yeah I got a fucking mile-long record.

182
00:09:31,722 --> 00:09:33,800
He has none. Don't worry
about anything. I got this covered.

183
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:35,568
I know the judge. I'll get this
done in two minutes.

184
00:09:35,592 --> 00:09:37,103
Cheryl, you gotta get me
the fuck out of here.

I'm legal aid.

186
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:41,231
Oh, I'm sorry. We don't...

187
00:09:41,265 --> 00:09:42,609
There must be some
misunderstanding.

188
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:43,600
Robert has counsel.

189
00:09:43,634 --> 00:09:45,736
Well, I've actually decided
to work with Cheryl.

190
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,206
CHERYL: Your Honor, this wasn't
a burglary case.

191
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:52,109
It's just the measly cost
of a broken window.

192
00:09:52,142 --> 00:09:54,578
My client wanted personal art
of sentimental value

193
00:09:54,611 --> 00:09:57,080
of his teacher, who had no
family anyway.

194
00:09:57,114 --> 00:09:59,283
The true issue here
is a grieving kid

195
00:09:59,316 --> 00:10:00,651
who just lost his teacher.

196
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:04,421
Your Honor, we've investigated
the facts and the circumstances.

197
00:10:04,454 --> 00:10:06,857
It's obvious this is
a victimless crime,

198
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,726
considering both the
relationship and the belongings.

199
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,128
Therefore, the state moves

200
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:12,272
to dismiss the case.
JUDGE: Motion granted,

201
00:10:12,296 --> 00:10:13,330
case dismissed.

202
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:16,333
Well, that was easy.

203
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,402
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate this,

204
00:10:18,435 --> 00:10:20,704
I have to say,

205
00:10:20,737 --> 00:10:22,639
I admire your independence.

206

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

207
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,647
Well, your father is here now,

208
00:10:30,681 --> 00:10:32,182
so maybe you'll say
something to him.

209

(COUGHING)

210
00:10:47,331 --> 00:10:48,332
You okay?

211
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:49,699
I'm fine.

212
00:10:53,203 --> 00:10:55,772
I didn't get you anything.
It's okay.

213
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,408
You know Peter's a good
friend, right?

214
00:10:58,442 --> 00:10:59,643
Mmm-hmm.

215
00:10:59,676 --> 00:11:02,412
You know, he took the morning
off so that he could help you?

216
00:11:02,446 --> 00:11:04,247
You know he has a big job?

217
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:06,383
So what I think
would be terrific

218
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,920
is if you could send him
a note that you write,

219
00:11:09,954 --> 00:11:13,190
and just thank him for his time
and apologize.

220
00:11:13,223 --> 00:11:15,359
You see, the thing is,
I didn't ask him to help me.

221
00:11:16,293 --> 00:11:17,327
You did.

222
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:18,695
Clearly, I didn't need his help.

223
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:20,364
So maybe you should write
him an apology.

224
00:11:20,397 --> 00:11:22,666
Get him a, I don't know,
give him a fruit basket.

225
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:24,334
He'd like that.
Fruit basket?

226
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,671
I've had a lot of time to think.

227
00:11:27,704 --> 00:11:28,672
Especially last night.

228
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:32,175
Really, you know,
cemented it into my mind.

229
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:35,312
And I made the decision I'm not gonna
go back to school after winter break.

230
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:37,781
Oh, you have?

231
00:11:37,814 --> 00:11:39,416
You had a cemented thought,

232
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,785
and then you're...
that's your conclusion?

233
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:44,321
Do you want to explain
that any further?

234
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:45,874
(MOUTH FULL)
I can't really explain it.

235
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:49,426
Why am I not surprised?

236
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:53,597
If you want to take time off after
you graduate, then that's an option.

237
00:11:54,698 --> 00:11:56,968
But you need
to get your diploma.

238
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:59,703
So come January, you're going
to show up on time.

239
00:11:59,736 --> 00:12:00,771
You're going to smile.

240
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,049
You're going to look interested.

241
00:12:02,073 --> 00:12:04,708
You can get straight D's for all
we care, but you're gonna pass.

242
00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:07,477
Or I could just get my GED
and never suffer again.

243
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:09,047
I don't understand
how that works.

that's the stupidest idea I've ever heard.

Right there. Right there.

You know... you know what
you get with it?

00:12:14,785 --> 00:12:16,353
You know what you get
with the GED?

248

You know what kind of job
you would get?

249
00:12:17,454 --> 00:12:18,755
What?
Gas station.

250
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:20,791
I'd love to work
in a gas station.

251
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,759
Would you like to work
in the dishwasher?

252
00:12:22,793 --> 00:12:24,004
Yeah.
You want to work back there?

253
00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:25,862
There's no reason to be
so condescending

254
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:27,798
towards people who work
those kinds of jobs.

255
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:28,976
JENNIFER: He's not
being condescending.

256
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,667
You can't get a job
as a dishwasher.

they wake up in the morning?

258
00:12:31,935 --> 00:12:33,804
5 A.M.
4:45 probably.

259
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,338
It doesn't matter anyway.

260
00:12:35,372 --> 00:12:36,716
How is that going to look
on your application?

261

I don't give a shit.

262
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:39,609
Art schools don't
give a shit, okay?

263
00:12:39,643 --> 00:12:41,278
They only care about
the portfolio.

264
00:12:42,446 --> 00:12:44,347
Besides, I might not even
go to college anyway.

265

go to college.

taking a lot.

always do this, you get really close.

Calm down, Rob.

Yeah, only in the context
of high school.

its complete shit. It sucks.

on yourself, Miles.

00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,511
In whatever way.

525
00:26:34,811 --> 00:26:36,413
Um, uh...

526
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:40,684
You know what? Don't
worry about it. Okay.

527
00:26:40,717 --> 00:26:44,588
Uh, in regard to your outburst
at Rite Aid Pharmacy,

528
00:26:44,621 --> 00:26:47,257
I think that you will want
to plead guilty to that charge.

529
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:48,525
I think that's our best bet.

530
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,728
Listen.

531
00:26:51,762 --> 00:26:55,666
I'd imagine you get
a lot of maniacs in here.

532
00:26:55,699 --> 00:27:00,270
But this is a very specific,
unique case.

533
00:27:00,304 --> 00:27:03,540
And I can assure are you
that you are in good hands.

534
00:27:03,574 --> 00:27:06,610
I approach all my cases
with the same care.

535
00:27:06,643 --> 00:27:08,621
Frankly, I'd be better off
defending myself out there,

536
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:11,281
because after my last experience
with this, I'm not in the market

537
00:27:11,315 --> 00:27:13,216
for another simple jackass
with an agenda.

538
00:27:15,652 --> 00:27:18,288
Robert, honey, you don't need
to be writing this part down.

539
00:27:18,322 --> 00:27:20,722
I bet this wouldn't be just
another case if I was paying you.

540
00:27:22,593 --> 00:27:25,429
I refuse to go to court if this
is my only option.

541
00:27:25,462 --> 00:27:27,531
Well, not showing up
for your court date

542
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:31,735
will ensure you time in jail,
which is not an option.

543
00:27:31,768 --> 00:27:34,838
Right, Wallace? Please
don't make this difficult.

544
00:27:34,871 --> 00:27:37,240
It is my job to believe you.

545
00:27:39,643 --> 00:27:40,877
(LAUGHS)

546
00:27:51,388 --> 00:27:53,323
Miles, you're so fucking
disgusting.

547
00:27:53,824 --> 00:27:55,759
What?

548
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:58,295
I don't know. You're just
chewing really loud

549
00:27:58,328 --> 00:28:00,230
and you got grease
all over your fingers.

550
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:02,758
No wonder you skin
looks like hell.

551
00:28:03,634 --> 00:28:04,635
Pork rinds make it worse?

552
00:28:05,702 --> 00:28:07,604
Yeah of course.

553
00:28:07,638 --> 00:28:11,341
They did a study a little
while ago, at Harvard.

554
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:12,719
They studied pork rinds
at Harvard?

555
00:28:12,743 --> 00:28:16,146
Yeah. Dr Frankensladder.
You ever heard of him?

556
00:28:17,581 --> 00:28:19,282
Well, basically,
he came to the conclusion

557
00:28:19,316 --> 00:28:23,787
that acne is an unconscious
refusal to mature into adulthood.

558
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,989
What are you talking about?

559
00:28:25,023 --> 00:28:27,824
Bad skin is one way to ensure
absolutely no one in the world

560
00:28:27,858 --> 00:28:29,326
expects you to act
like a grown-up.

561
00:28:31,963 --> 00:28:33,497
I'm not gonna stop eating
pork rinds.

562
00:28:38,235 --> 00:28:39,503
These things are good.

563
00:28:54,518 --> 00:28:57,454
Wow. This is it?

564
00:28:57,854 --> 00:28:58,922
Yeah.

565
00:29:00,024 --> 00:29:01,425
It's incredible.

566
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:02,459
Yeah, it's cool.

567
00:29:02,926 --> 00:29:03,927
Yeah.

568
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:15,839
This is the best.

569
00:29:15,872 --> 00:29:17,008
Just shut that door.

570
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:18,076
I can't wait.

571
00:29:18,109 --> 00:29:20,477
I'm going to take the train
here every weekend.

572
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,679
We're going to stay up
all night drawing.

573
00:29:22,713 --> 00:29:24,757
We're going to have such a
great time. All right, all right, Miles.

574
00:29:24,781 --> 00:29:26,984
Please, just cool your
jets. Don't embarrass me.

575
00:29:27,018 --> 00:29:28,218
Okay.

576
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,858
Hey, Barry.

577
00:29:34,891 --> 00:29:35,892
Hello.

578
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:40,530
Slam it tight.

Oh, sorry. Wrong room.

585
00:30:36,353 --> 00:30:37,854
Sit right down.

586
00:30:37,888 --> 00:30:40,091
Sit down.
Right here?

587
00:30:40,124 --> 00:30:43,693
(TV CONTINUES PLAYING)

588
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:54,704
What? You started without me?

589
00:30:59,043 --> 00:31:02,479
What are you watching?
Beneath a 12-Mile Reef.

590
00:31:02,512 --> 00:31:04,581
With Richard Boone
and Robert Wagner,

591
00:31:05,515 --> 00:31:07,751
on glorious Cinemascope.

592
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:13,323
He's very handsome.

593
00:31:13,723 --> 00:31:14,724
You think so?

594
00:31:17,761 --> 00:31:19,462
Did you ever hear
of Richard Boone?

595
00:31:19,496 --> 00:31:20,564
Nah.

596
00:31:20,597 --> 00:31:23,900
He later played Paladin on TV,
and once he was a guest

597
00:31:23,934 --> 00:31:25,036
on The Joe Franklin Show.

598
00:31:25,069 --> 00:31:26,870
Did you ever
hear of The Joe Franklin Show?

599
00:31:26,903 --> 00:31:28,738
Well, that was before your time.

600
00:31:28,772 --> 00:31:31,741
But he was a big talk show host
in New York for many, many years.

601
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:33,510
He was great.

602
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:36,546
You like adventure movies?

603
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,857
Oh, I love them.
I love them all.

604
00:31:37,881 --> 00:31:41,152
You know, Gulliver's Travels?
The Dave Fleischer. Oh yes.

605
00:31:41,185 --> 00:31:44,021
Oh sure I do. His brother Max.
It was his studio.

606
00:31:44,055 --> 00:31:46,556
Full length animated
feature in 1939.

607
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,025
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, that's great.

608
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:49,459
And I love the character
of Gabby.

609
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:50,803
Remember him?
The comedic character?

610
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:52,462
Yeah.
He was great.

611
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:07,844
Hey.

612
00:32:10,947 --> 00:32:11,992
What are you guys doing in here?

613
00:32:12,016 --> 00:32:13,850
We're watching movies.

614
00:32:13,884 --> 00:32:18,122
A friend of mine puts them on
discs for me in exchange for things.

615
00:32:18,155 --> 00:32:19,656
Cool.

616
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:26,529
(EXHALES)

617
00:32:32,036 --> 00:32:33,037
Do you have any sodas?

618
00:32:36,907 --> 00:32:37,908
Comics.

619
00:32:43,813 --> 00:32:44,948
Oh, boy.

620
00:32:48,085 --> 00:32:50,955
We have fans of the
funnies, Steven.

621
00:32:52,256 --> 00:32:54,158
Did you hear me?

622
00:32:54,191 --> 00:32:56,459
Robert likes funny
books, Steven.

623
00:32:57,761 --> 00:33:00,031
Dick Tracy?
Dick Tracy rules.

00:33:04,235 --> 00:33:05,568
Blondie.

625
00:33:05,602 --> 00:33:06,503
Yeah.

626
00:33:06,536 --> 00:33:08,139
STEVEN: Batman and Robin.
ROBERT: Yeah.

You like Archie and Jughead?

629
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:16,646
I was in the Archie Fan club.

630
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,983
What, really?
BARRY: Mmm-hmm.

631
00:33:19,016 --> 00:33:20,450
STEVEN: One Big Happy.

632
00:33:22,886 --> 00:33:24,121
You guys sure like comics.

00:33:24,155 --> 00:33:25,156

ROBERT: Wait, what.
Steven.

636
00:33:39,569 --> 00:33:41,571
Okay. Could you be careful
with that one?

637
00:33:44,774 --> 00:33:45,775
It's a rarity, isn't it?

638
00:33:46,643 --> 00:33:47,911
Tijuana Bibles? Yeah.

639
00:33:47,944 --> 00:33:52,149
This, this anonymous cartoonist
did 'em, like a long time ago.

640
00:33:52,183 --> 00:33:54,684
But they're so fucking dirty.

641
00:33:54,718 --> 00:33:57,787
They're just really insane
and vulgar. Um...

642
00:33:59,123 --> 00:34:01,058
But, yeah, they're really...
they're really rare.

643
00:34:01,092 --> 00:34:02,868
You can find them if
you're looking for em usually.

644
00:34:02,892 --> 00:34:04,561
STEVEN: This is disgusting.

645
00:34:04,594 --> 00:34:06,263
They're like 20, 30,
sometimes higher.

646
00:34:06,297 --> 00:34:07,797
It's a bit much isn't it?

647
00:34:09,766 --> 00:34:11,302
Well, it's supply and demand.

648
00:34:11,335 --> 00:34:12,412
There should be more actually.

649
00:34:12,436 --> 00:34:14,604
But most people don't really
care about that stuff.

650
00:34:15,939 --> 00:34:18,309
That one's actually our old
art teacher's.

651
00:34:18,342 --> 00:34:21,278
Your teacher's?
He was into subversive stuff.

652
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,715
That one had
a lot of subversion.

653
00:34:25,749 --> 00:34:27,284
Subversion.

654
00:34:31,155 --> 00:34:32,256
Yeah.

655
00:34:37,962 --> 00:34:41,831
I like that, Barry.
Reminds me of <i>The Munsters</i>

656
00:34:41,865 --> 00:34:44,235
where Paul Lynde
went to the house

657
00:34:44,268 --> 00:34:49,739
and they served him water in
their best china, and he took a sip

658
00:34:49,773 --> 00:34:53,010
and at the bottom of the glass
was a giant widow spider.

00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,647

00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,250
ROBERT: What's this
comic called?

662
00:34:59,283 --> 00:35:01,651
CLERK: Oh, it's some crappy,
you know,

663
00:35:01,684 --> 00:35:04,021
funny animal anthology,
mess of reprints.

664
00:35:04,055 --> 00:35:05,322
You know.

665
00:35:05,356 --> 00:35:07,091
Pay wasn't good.
Nobody took it seriously.

666
00:35:07,124 --> 00:35:09,193
People batted
the shit out overnight.

667
00:35:09,226 --> 00:35:10,127
ROBERT: Sounds like it's good.
Like look at this.

668
00:35:10,161 --> 00:35:11,438
What is this red void
he's floating on?

669
00:35:11,462 --> 00:35:14,265
And why is his... Why is his chin
cut off? (ROBERT LAUGHING)

670
00:35:14,298 --> 00:35:18,169
Like a perfectly flat... What
is that line a cut off for?

671
00:35:18,202 --> 00:35:19,413
It's just a mess on every level.

672
00:35:19,437 --> 00:35:21,972
It's like so they wouldn't even
print these things right.

673
00:35:22,006 --> 00:35:24,051
Half the time, it's like they
have the colors spilling out

674
00:35:24,075 --> 00:35:25,885
on the wrong sides of the lines
and crap. They don't look that bad.

675
00:35:25,909 --> 00:35:27,211
I mean, they don't look sloppy.

676
00:35:27,244 --> 00:35:29,380
I love it, man.
I think it's loose.

677
00:35:29,413 --> 00:35:30,981
You know what I mean?

678
00:35:31,015 --> 00:35:34,018
It's like Warhol.
I brought my new Afrobot.

679
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:35,152
Nice.

680
00:35:36,987 --> 00:35:38,588
I'm really proud of it.

681
00:35:40,391 --> 00:35:41,624
Yeah, you want a critique?

682
00:35:41,658 --> 00:35:42,659
Sure.

683
00:35:43,827 --> 00:35:46,297
Afrobot and Segar's Treasure.

684
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,631

Popeye, you know?

(CHUCKLES)

686
00:35:51,435 --> 00:35:52,769
What's funny?

687
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:06,383
I don't know, Miles.

688
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:08,085
Your line work's like
really ratty.

689
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:10,955
That's just my style.
But crude isn't a style.

690
00:36:10,988 --> 00:36:12,089
I'm... I'm sorry.

691
00:36:12,123 --> 00:36:13,157
I just want to help you.

692
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,426
I mean, this is the fifth
one, right? Mmm-hmm.

693
00:36:15,459 --> 00:36:18,661
I don't... I really...
It's not for me.

694
00:36:18,695 --> 00:36:19,929
I'm sorry. It's not for me.

695
00:36:19,964 --> 00:36:21,031
The poor guy.

696
00:36:21,065 --> 00:36:22,266
You've got to put him down.

697
00:36:22,299 --> 00:36:24,435
He's like flailing around
in a coma.

698
00:36:24,468 --> 00:36:26,403
Just pull the plug.
Robert.

699
00:36:26,437 --> 00:36:29,240
Besides, nobody buys
the mini-comics as it is.

700
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:31,275
Yo, move, move!

701
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:34,011
Yo, move.

702
00:36:34,044 --> 00:36:35,412
I think I deserve
a second opinion.

703
00:36:35,446 --> 00:36:36,646
All right.

704
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:39,716
Hey, everybody.

705
00:36:39,749 --> 00:36:41,152
Who wants to win a free
comic book?

706
00:36:42,219 --> 00:36:44,355
No, I'm okay.
Nobody.

707
00:36:44,388 --> 00:36:46,390
George. George.

708
00:36:46,423 --> 00:36:48,135
If you give this a review,
you get to keep it.

709
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:49,293
Just don't mince words.

710
00:36:49,326 --> 00:36:51,694
They have a price,
it says one measly buck.

711
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,268
Did you really draw this?

712
00:37:01,905 --> 00:37:04,807
It looks like Tales from
Be an world to me.

713
00:37:04,841 --> 00:37:07,077
The eyes look like Be an world.

714
00:37:07,877 --> 00:37:10,247
The Sprout-Butts, it's...

715
00:37:10,281 --> 00:37:12,349
I'm sure he's just stealing
from it subconsciously.

716
00:37:12,383 --> 00:37:14,251
Yeah, I think he stole it.

717
00:37:14,285 --> 00:37:15,794
I've never read Tales
from the Be an world.

718
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:17,388
I bet you have.
Kinda reminds me

719
00:37:17,421 --> 00:37:23,327
when Gran'Ma'Pa threw that fabulous
Look See Show for all the beans.

720
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,395
Ring a bell?

721
00:37:24,428 --> 00:37:25,429
Does that ring a bell?

722
00:37:26,197 --> 00:37:27,498
Ding ding!

723
00:37:27,531 --> 00:37:29,799
I think the Sprout-Butts

724
00:37:29,832 --> 00:37:32,369
in Be an world, they... they
look more like little beads.

725
00:37:32,403 --> 00:37:34,371
(LAUGHS) Oh my God,
you have read it.

726
00:37:35,406 --> 00:37:36,739
You're a cheater.

727
00:37:36,773 --> 00:37:38,475
Pulling from Be an world
for inspo.

728
00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:40,954
You're allowed to have diverse
influences as a cartoonist, Robert.

729
00:37:40,978 --> 00:37:43,947
You have the most obvious
egghead taste in everything.

730
00:37:43,981 --> 00:37:45,015
You have asshole taste.

731
00:37:45,049 --> 00:37:46,249
You love the taste of asshole.

732
00:37:46,883 --> 00:37:47,884
Taste of asshole?

733
00:37:49,553 --> 00:37:50,454
Miles is making strides.

734
00:37:50,487 --> 00:37:53,290
I'll buy five for the
mini comics shelf.

735
00:37:53,324 --> 00:37:55,159
Great. I only made five.

736
00:37:56,926 --> 00:37:59,430
Can I owe you for those?
Sure.

737
00:38:02,799 --> 00:38:04,934
Oh. That's Neal Adams.

738
00:38:04,969 --> 00:38:07,438
Grip that shit. Top shelf.
Oh, cool.

739
00:38:07,471 --> 00:38:11,342
Except Joe's idea of top-shelf was
trash like McFarlane's early <i>Spawn</i> run.

740
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:12,409
Don't be a dickhead.

741
00:38:12,443 --> 00:38:14,111
This shit's meant to be fun.

742
00:38:14,144 --> 00:38:15,522
That's, that's why they
call them the funnies.

743
00:38:15,546 --> 00:38:17,386
They don't call them
the funnies for no reason.

744
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:22,052
This is what you got?

745
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:23,753
Mmm-hmm.

746
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,024
(EXHALES)

747
00:38:30,494 --> 00:38:31,972
You're not threatened
by me or something,

748
00:38:31,996 --> 00:38:33,896
now that I'm drawing
cartoonier looking comics?

749
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:42,939
Miles, if I'm being honest,
I think they show promise.

750
00:38:42,973 --> 00:38:44,117
But...
I asked you a question.

751
00:38:44,141 --> 00:38:46,876
No, I'm certainly not threatened
by you drawing like me.

752
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:51,582
Yeah, I'm flattered.
But if Katano were alive,

753
00:38:51,615 --> 00:38:53,584
he'd call it a hodge.
A half-assed job.

754
00:38:53,617 --> 00:38:54,951
Because it is.

755
00:38:57,521 --> 00:39:01,258
I didn't want to tell you, but
Katano helped me with the story line.

756
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:03,160
He actually loved it.

757
00:39:04,595 --> 00:39:08,165
So he said I'd turned
on my lights for this one.

758
00:39:08,966 --> 00:39:10,534
Okay. Great.

759
00:39:10,567 --> 00:39:12,303
Then why are you showing
it to me?

760
00:39:12,336 --> 00:39:13,404
You haven't seen this.

761
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:14,871
I've been working on it
a long time.

762
00:39:14,904 --> 00:39:16,383
Well, maybe don't
mention his opinion.

763
00:39:16,407 --> 00:39:18,442
If you're going to ask
my advice.

764
00:39:18,475 --> 00:39:20,475
Because I don't think
he was always honest with us.

765
00:39:21,078 --> 00:39:22,079
Honestly.

766
00:39:25,649 --> 00:39:26,517
That's $4.50.

767
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,218
That's including the
friendly discount?

768
00:39:28,252 --> 00:39:29,412
Well, there's a friendly tax.

769
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:46,836
How long are you going to be?

770
00:39:48,672 --> 00:39:51,642
Just a minute. Oh, you're
working for Cheryl, right?

771
00:39:51,675 --> 00:39:53,310
Yeah. Sometimes.

772
00:39:55,045 --> 00:39:56,613
You think she's good looking?

773
00:39:56,647 --> 00:40:00,150
Uh, she's really nice.
She's a really kind person.

774
00:40:00,184 --> 00:40:02,419
She's also a dishonest
person too.

775
00:40:02,453 --> 00:40:04,955
You turn your back,
she'll talk behind your back.

776
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:07,291
Um, I'm just gonna be a minute.

777
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:09,193
Before that, I was
fixing computers.

778
00:40:09,226 --> 00:40:11,528
And who were you fixing
computers for?

779
00:40:11,562 --> 00:40:14,231
For people whose computers
were broken?

780
00:40:14,264 --> 00:40:15,898
Okay.

781
00:40:15,932 --> 00:40:19,902
And after that, you worked
for a company called Image.

782
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:21,871
Years ago.
Wait, Image Comics?

783
00:40:24,241 --> 00:40:28,245
It says here that you were a
creative supervisor of some sort.

784
00:40:28,278 --> 00:40:31,415
That's just a fancy way of
saying I was a color separator.

785
00:40:31,448 --> 00:40:33,650
It's like an assistant
to the colorist,

786
00:40:35,185 --> 00:40:36,653
but more assembly line.

787
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:41,191
I wasn't an artist.
Nobody get all excited.

788
00:40:41,225 --> 00:40:43,260
And what ended your position

789
00:40:43,293 --> 00:40:46,063
as an assistant colorist there?

790
00:40:46,096 --> 00:40:47,664
Isn't that in your notes?

791
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:50,467
Yeah. No, it's, it's just
mentioned briefly,

792
00:40:50,501 --> 00:40:53,936
but I would, I would love
to hear it from you,

793
00:40:53,971 --> 00:40:56,273
since that was the position
that you had the longest

794
00:40:56,306 --> 00:40:58,375
and had the most
responsibilities.

795
00:40:58,409 --> 00:41:00,086
Because you're talking about
a 10-year-old incident.

796
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,345
It's completely irrelevant,

797
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:02,989
and inappropriate to
bring into this. Wallace...

798
00:41:03,013 --> 00:41:04,624
It's... It's obviously
all in front of you.

799
00:41:04,648 --> 00:41:06,459
You don't need to hear
anything about it from me.

800
00:41:06,483 --> 00:41:08,318
I understand why
it would seem that way,

801
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,987
but it is better for me.

802
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,422
I can build a better case
for you

803
00:41:11,455 --> 00:41:13,175
if I understand...
Let's close this subject.

804
00:41:14,658 --> 00:41:15,859
Yo, Joe.

805
00:41:15,893 --> 00:41:18,662
Yeah. Where are those old
Image back issues I sold you?

806
00:41:19,596 --> 00:41:20,707
Hell of a constitution you have.

807
00:41:20,731 --> 00:41:21,965
Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah.

808
00:41:21,999 --> 00:41:23,000
Yuck it up.

809
00:41:24,301 --> 00:41:26,003
Could you move?

810
00:41:26,036 --> 00:41:27,304
What?
Move.

811
00:41:27,337 --> 00:41:28,605
No! Go.

812
00:41:33,277 --> 00:41:35,979
JOE: You're not getting
a discount on those.

813
00:41:36,013 --> 00:41:37,681
Come on, now.
Those aren't yours anymore.

814
00:42:52,256 --> 00:42:53,257
Hey, man.

815
00:42:55,659 --> 00:42:56,660
Sorry to bother you.

816
00:43:00,764 --> 00:43:03,367
I just can't believe
you worked at Image.

817
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:09,273
It's definitely, uh, really big, early,
you know, an inspiration for me.

818
00:43:09,306 --> 00:43:10,340
Inspiration to what?

819
00:43:10,374 --> 00:43:11,375
Become a typist?

820
00:43:11,675 --> 00:43:12,676
(LAUGHS)

821
00:43:12,709 --> 00:43:17,748
No, no, I'm actually...
My main thing is I, uh...

822
00:43:18,348 --> 00:43:19,716
Draw.

823
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:24,555
Okay, well, again, I was
assistant to a colorist.

824
00:43:24,588 --> 00:43:28,692
Color separator, I had no creative
input in the product you read.

825
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,534
(DOOR SLAMS)

826
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:55,218
(WHISPERS) Wow!

827
00:43:55,252 --> 00:43:57,654
MAN: I had to go to
the bathroom bad,

828
00:43:57,688 --> 00:44:00,524
and everything's closed down,
you know?

829
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:05,162
So, I got a cup,
I went in the bathroom,

830
00:44:05,195 --> 00:44:07,364
and I took a hot piss
in the car.

831
00:44:07,831 --> 00:44:08,932
Right?

832
00:44:08,967 --> 00:44:14,571
And then a woman must have
saw me, called the police.

833
00:44:14,605 --> 00:44:16,573
They opened up the doors,
they grabbed me,

834
00:44:16,607 --> 00:44:20,611
he punches me in my face,
throws me against the cop car.

835
00:44:20,644 --> 00:44:23,647
She's making me
plead guilty against my will.

836
00:44:24,848 --> 00:44:26,216
Boy, you guys...

837
00:44:31,188 --> 00:44:35,258
I just... I wanted to say that I think
your mark on those Image books is,

838
00:44:35,292 --> 00:44:36,892
like way more distinctive
than you think.

839
00:44:38,629 --> 00:44:39,830
What does that mean?

840
00:44:39,863 --> 00:44:42,466
It feels like it doesn't...

841
00:44:42,499 --> 00:44:45,535
mean anything, but it...
You speak very well.

842
00:44:45,569 --> 00:44:46,570
Very good.
Um...

843
00:44:46,603 --> 00:44:49,439
Just that it does.
It's art, and it has impact

844
00:44:49,473 --> 00:44:50,774
and meaning and... Impact.

845
00:44:52,843 --> 00:44:55,555
Well, like think of how many people
read the books that you worked on.

846
00:44:55,579 --> 00:44:58,782
You separated those colors,
you know, that's a big deal.

847
00:44:59,883 --> 00:45:02,886
I know.
He's a professional.

848
00:45:08,525 --> 00:45:10,661
I don't know.
This is really crazy for me.

849
00:45:10,694 --> 00:45:13,530
I've just never met a
professional cartoonist before.

850
00:45:13,563 --> 00:45:17,200
And I really think that your separating
style is really its own unique thing.

851
00:45:19,569 --> 00:45:20,937
I just, I have to show you.

852
00:45:20,972 --> 00:45:23,907
I have to show you like, like...

(ROBERT EXHALES)

854
00:45:28,545 --> 00:45:32,516
Like here, the way the neon
colors bleed over the lines.

855
00:45:32,549 --> 00:45:34,317
You only really get
that in older printing,

856
00:45:34,351 --> 00:45:36,753
And it's kind of...
That's what I worked on?

857
00:45:38,488 --> 00:45:40,323
Um, I think. Is it?

858
00:45:40,357 --> 00:45:43,927
Maybe it's not...
Boy, you did beautiful work

859
00:45:43,961 --> 00:45:45,595
Doin' that stuff.
Why'd you have this?

860
00:45:47,264 --> 00:45:49,967
Um... Weirdly, I've just
been re-reading them.

861
00:45:52,036 --> 00:45:53,613
But what were you going
for them with that style? It's...

862
00:45:53,637 --> 00:45:55,372
You're making him upset.

863
00:45:55,405 --> 00:45:57,541
I was going for my survival.

864
00:45:57,574 --> 00:45:59,543
I'm in the middle
of legal counseling here.

865
00:45:59,576 --> 00:46:01,511
Right. Yeah. I'm so sorry.

866
00:46:03,814 --> 00:46:06,717
ROBERT: Sorry.
Some crazy kid.

867
00:46:07,918 --> 00:46:09,158
What the hell's wrong with him?

868
00:46:10,654 --> 00:46:12,823
With a guy like that,
you gotta calm down.

anything about my life,

you're immediately judgmental.

we have you here,

maybe you could answer some
questions about Robert's life.

Wallace doesn't talk to his own family.

He couldn't breathe.

breathe so I opened the windows for him.

Well, did you unlock the lock?

1216

Did you think of doing that?
Yes.

It's stuck from when
they were painted.

going to blame the painters?

1219
01:07:01,671 --> 01:07:03,916
Is that what this is about? No, I'm
not blaming the painters, I'm trying

1220

to explain my situation. 'Cause
it's always someone else's fault.

them back without even opening them.

01:15:09,026 --> 01:15:11,061
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.

1373
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:14,231
Okay,

1374
01:15:18,068 --> 01:15:19,069
And...

1375
01:15:21,371 --> 01:15:23,674
if you do a good job,

1376
01:15:24,708 --> 01:15:26,028
maybe it will turn
into something.

1377
01:15:30,314 --> 01:15:31,448
Seriously?

1378
01:15:31,482 --> 01:15:36,019
Look, I've haven't been
in the game for a while but...

1379
01:15:37,221 --> 01:15:38,722
Let's just say
I have connections.

1380
01:15:39,423 --> 01:15:40,424
You wanna...

1381
01:15:43,293 --> 01:15:45,095
I'm deeply moved.
But be careful with that.

1382
01:15:45,128 --> 01:15:48,131
I just can't believe you would
do that for me. Yeah, yeah.

1383
01:15:48,165 --> 01:15:50,100
Just be careful with that.
Oh, okay.

1384
01:15:50,133 --> 01:15:51,134
I'm back.

1385
01:15:52,336 --> 01:15:54,538
I wanted to grab my original
so you can see the details.

1386
01:15:58,308 --> 01:15:59,776
What do you think?

1387
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:02,010
We're in the middle of a
lesson. He paid for one lesson.

1388
01:16:02,513 --> 01:16:03,793
Just be careful with
the shadows.

1389
01:16:04,848 --> 01:16:06,049
I can draw.

1390
01:16:10,854 --> 01:16:12,422
Katano said my style's my own.

1391
01:16:14,157 --> 01:16:15,225
Okay.

1392
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:18,161
Don't know what that means.

1393
01:16:22,232 --> 01:16:23,734
Isn't imagination...

1394
01:16:24,801 --> 01:16:25,802
more important?

1395
01:16:27,204 --> 01:16:28,438
I mean, than craft?

1396
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:34,287
You see the influence
of the Duck book?

1397
01:16:34,311 --> 01:16:36,513
Just shut up, Miles.
He doesn't care.

1398
01:16:41,485 --> 01:16:43,453
This is Wallace's?

1399
01:16:43,487 --> 01:16:46,189
Yeah, some sample stuff he did
when he was separating.

1400
01:16:46,223 --> 01:16:47,491
MILES: Separating?

1401
01:16:49,326 --> 01:16:51,528
So you weren't
even an artist at Image.

1402
01:16:54,698 --> 01:16:57,501
ROBERT: Miles, please. Is form
really more important to you than soul?

1403
01:16:57,534 --> 01:16:59,336
Miles, please.

1404
01:16:59,369 --> 01:17:02,472
Is form really more
important than soul to you?

1405
01:17:04,841 --> 01:17:06,476
What would Katano say
about this?

1406
01:17:06,510 --> 01:17:09,513
Miles, please. Form is
more important than soul?

1407
01:17:09,546 --> 01:17:12,783
Miles. Please. don't quiz
a pro on art.

1408
01:17:12,816 --> 01:17:14,536
I'm quizzing him on soul.
(SCREAMS) Don't...

1409
01:17:17,487 --> 01:17:18,622
Don't quiz me on soul.

1410
01:17:26,763 --> 01:17:27,764
What did you do?

1411
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,668
What did you do?

1412
01:17:31,702 --> 01:17:33,537
Stand up. Now!

1413
01:17:38,508 --> 01:17:41,308
ROBERT: I was just practicing the
texture, I was going to black it out.

1414
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:45,549
I was gonna black
that out eventually.

1415
01:17:45,582 --> 01:17:48,218
You ruined the fucking page.

1416
01:17:48,251 --> 01:17:52,189
Wallace. I was just practicing
the texture. I'm just inking it out.

1417
01:17:52,222 --> 01:17:55,926
I'm... Look, I can white
some of that out if you prefer.

1418
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:59,496
I can do it great, I swear.
No. You can't!

1419
01:17:59,529 --> 01:18:01,832
I'm trying to sell this,
you fucking amateur!

1420
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:05,335
Well, maybe what sells
these days is originality.

1421
01:18:05,369 --> 01:18:09,606
Just face up to the fact that you
failed and you're not very good.

1422
01:18:15,545 --> 01:18:17,347
Do I really just suck to you?

1423
01:18:18,548 --> 01:18:20,851
My style isn't...
You didn't fail.

1424
01:18:22,219 --> 01:18:24,821
If anything, he made it more...

1425
01:18:26,623 --> 01:18:27,691
Artistic.

1426
01:18:33,998 --> 01:18:38,368
No one in this room
is an artist. Okay?

1427
01:18:39,369 --> 01:18:40,570
I'm not an artist.

1428
01:18:40,604 --> 01:18:41,638
You're not an artist.

1429
01:18:41,672 --> 01:18:43,473
You're definitely not an artist.

1430
01:18:43,507 --> 01:18:44,941

1431

You failed.

1436
01:18:59,890 --> 01:19:01,692
Yeah, but he failed with soul.

1437
01:19:01,725 --> 01:19:02,726
That's the difference.

1438
01:19:05,997 --> 01:19:09,332

Can I take a look

1441
01:19:18,642 --> 01:19:20,377
at what you were writing?

1442
