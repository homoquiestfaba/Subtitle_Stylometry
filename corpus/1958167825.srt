Once upon a time...

13
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,878
(high vocalizing)

14
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,045
(birds twitter)

15
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,297
In a faraway land...

16
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,298
(thunder crashes)

17
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,098
I am Raven Queen,

18
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,434
daughter of the evil queen.

19
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,437
And I pledge...

20
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:05,733
- Um, I...
- Come on, do it.

21
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,275
I... (sighs)

22
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,236
Male Narrator:
All eyes were on Raven

23
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,279
as she faced
the most important choice...

24
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,407
- (record scratches)
- Female Narrator: Really?
You're gonna start there?

25
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,700
At Legacy Day?

26
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,243
Male Narrator:
You know there's
only really room

27
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,285
for one narrator here.

28
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,495
Female Narrator:
Start at the beginning,

29
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,622
where the whole
Rebel and Royal drama began.

30
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,500
Male Narrator:
Oh fine. Gather 'round,
friends,

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,419
and let us tell you a story,

32
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,212
the story
of Ever After High.

33
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,090
(giggles)

34
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,468
(sneezes)

35
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,346
Male Narrator:
A high school for the teenage
sons and daughters...

36
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,724
- (grunts)
- of the most famous
fairy-tale characters...

37
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,308
- (ribbits)
- who ever lived.

38
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,643
Whoa.

39
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,645
Male Narrator:
But this year was
like no other

40
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,607
- (bleating)
- for the students
of Ever After High.

41
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,699
It was the year of Legacy Day...

42
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:58,326
- (chirps)
- a momentous event

43
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,996
where the students pledge
to all the magical world

44
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:04,499
to follow the same paths
as their fairy-tale parents.

45
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,919
Female Narrator:
Which they better do, or else.

46
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:10,005
Male Narrator:
I'm sorry. Who's telling
this story? If you don't...

47
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:13,467
Would you two
stop fighting?
Peas and crackers.

48
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,011
Um, who are
you talking to?

49
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,512
Why, the narrators.

50
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:20,641
Oh, you can't hear them,
Raven. Only I can.

51
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,851
- Okay.
- (gasps, giggles)

52
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,186
- Can I talk now?
- Mm-hmm.

53
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:29,190
It's just... I'm sick of everyone
thinking I'm so evil

54
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,567
because my mom was.

55
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,402
It's not fair!

56
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:37,825
No one thinks you're evil.
Now you're just talking crazy.

57
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:40,869
- (mimic bell)
- The daughter of the Mad Hatter

58
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,998
calls me crazy?
(sighs)

59
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,000
Would you stop
with the worry flurry?

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,585
Everyone at school
loves you.

61
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,046
It's Raven Queen!
Run!

62
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,632
She is evil!

63
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,174
Run, everyone.

64
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,343
- (bleats)
- (screams)

65
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,053
(doors slam shut)

66
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:00,806
See? They love you.

67
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,223
(watch rings)

68
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,224
(sproinging)

69
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,435
Yay! Tea time.

70
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,313
- Earl Grey.
- (squeaking)

71
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,565
Oh, you clever dormouse.
Why yes,

72
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,734
this is a new dress.

73
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,366
Male Narrator:
And so, life for Raven
was not easy,

74
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,242
feeling alone and isolated.

75
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:24,496
Female Narrator:
As it should be.
She is destined to be evil.

76
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:27,666
Male Narrator:
Couldn't go 20 seconds
without talking, could you?

77
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,626
Hey, Raven, uh...

78
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,586
You look gort.
I mean great.

79
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,588
I... I don't even
know what gort is.

80
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:37,217
I'd offer you a seat,
but I'm evil.

81
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,761
To sit here, you'd have
to be pretty...

82
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,346
- ...daring.
- (girls cheer)

83
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,099
Oh, Daring.

84
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,433
(cheering continues)

85
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,936
What? No, Raven.
I'm Dex.

86
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:51,065
Dexter Charming.
Daring's my bro... ther.

87
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,274
Oh, gort.

88
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,610
Raven, how's every
enchanted thing?

89
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,405
Apple White,
good to see you.
Hey, Daring.

90
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,991
I, uh, have to warn you.
Don't stare at the teeth.

91
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,617
Just got them whitened.

92
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,873
- (bell rings)
- Oh, oh, there's the bell.

93
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,499
Time for
Good Kingdom Management.

94
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,876
Raven, what's
your next class?

95
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,420
Uh, History of Evil Spells.

96
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,382
(giggles)
That is so
perfect for you.

97
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,385
Hey, Cerise,
how's it going?

98
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,804
(growls,
clears throat)

99
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,099
Oh, uh, sorry.
I... I have a cold.

100
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,060
Free food!

101
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:33,481
Male Narrator:
That night as Raven
returned to her dorm,

102
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,526
she found quite the surprise
waiting for her.

103
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,403
Hey, Maddie.

104
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,574
Welcome home, roomie.

105
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,492
Huh, good one, Apple.

106
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,036
I'm rooming with
Maddie this year.

107
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,537
Not anymore.

108
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,540
Since you're such
an important part
of my story...

109
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,375
You poison me.
I fall asleep.

110
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,920
The prince wakes you
with a kiss, blah blah blah.

111
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,797
Yada yada, I know. So?

112
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:01,176
So I asked Headmaster Grimm
if we could live together.

113
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:04,138
And he said yes.
Isn't that enchanting?

114
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,680
Uh, but... but...

115
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,809
Oh, oh, oh.
You are going to love
rooming with me.

116
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,518
I'm thoughtful
and beautiful

117
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,353
and I sing the most
wonderful songs

118
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:15,023
about woodland creatures.
(clears throat)

119
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:18,193
<i>♪ Oh the doves
love to fly</i>

120
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,862
<i>And the hares
love to burrow. ♪</i>

121
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,864
Move along.
Move along.

122
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,449
Nothing to see here.

123
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,744
And I already decorated
your half of the room.

124
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,706
Apple:
Isn't it just the evilest?

125
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,750
(giggles)
I knew you'd love it.

126
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,713
This is gonna
be a long year.

127
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,132
(bird coos)

128
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,301
Male Narrator:
Which brings us to
the rehearsals

129
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,511
for the Legacy Day ceremony.

130
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,387
So when your magical
key appears,

131
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:49,348
you insert it gently
into the Storybook of Legends,

132
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:54,313
then stand shoulders back
and declare your destiny
to the world.

133
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:55,689
Have I made myself clear?

134
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,858
Headmaster Grimm,
but what if...

135
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,234
No questions? Good.

136
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:02,070
Now, we're going to practice
with this tiny manual

137
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,572
of entirely
reasonable school rules.

138
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,574
(grunts)

139
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,660
Milton Grimm:
(clears throat)

140
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,995
(bleats)

141
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,872
Who will go first?

142
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,581
I, Madeline Hatter,

143
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,584
pledge to follow the destiny
of dear old Dad,

144
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,920
the Mad Hatter of Wonderland.

145
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,421
- (kettle whistles)
- When do I drink the tea?

146
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,840
Milton Grimm:
Next!

147
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,219
I'm Hunter Huntsman and
I pledge to follow my destiny

148
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:29,056
as the next Huntsman.
I'll swing my axe bravely and...

149
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:32,017
(blowing raspberry)

150
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,435
Really, Pesky?
You want to play that way?

151
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,604
Milton Grimm:
Next.

152
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,607
I'm... I'm Cedar Wood
and I pledge

153
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,776
to follow my destiny and
be the next Pinocchio.

154
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,196
Well, I mean, not
the next Pinocchio.

155
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:47,448
I mean, actually,
I can only tell the truth
while I'm in school,

156
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,408
but then one day...
one day, I'm gonna lie.

157
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:52,704
Uh, but does that mean
that I'm gonna be like my dad
or not like my dad?

158
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:53,747
Milton Grimm:
Next.

159
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,665
I'm Raven Queen

160
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:59,418
and I pledge to
follow my destiny as...

161
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,880
Um, I have a question.

162
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,965
What is it?

163
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,884
I was just wondering,
I mean,

164
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:09,388
what if I don't
want to take the pledge?

165
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:10,722
(gasps)

166
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,391
(gasps)

167
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,642
What? It's just a question.

168
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,728
And here's your answer.

169
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,980
If you don't
pledge your destiny,

170
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,692
your story ceases
to exist.

171
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,819
Ceases to exist?

172
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,281
So then what happens to me?

173
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,325
You will cease to exist.

174
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,492
Poof.

175
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:34,996
Now, Raven, continue.

176
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,124
- But, Mr. Grimm...
- Poof, poof!

177
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,750
Um...

178
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:43,046
I have to go.

179
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,672
(crowd gasping)

180
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,634
- (crowd mutters)
- What about her destiny?

181
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,136
Milton Grimm:
Now, settle down, everyone.

182
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,346
Male Narrator:
In the Vault of Lost Tales,

183
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,933
deep beneath the school,
another was listening.

184
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,684
(crazy laughter)

185
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,938
Male Narrator:
Giles Grimm, the brother
of the school's headmaster.

186
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:03,650
The Raven flies.
The clouds, they sing.

187
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,362
But what should happen
when the tide roles in?

188
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,823
(sighs)

189
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:13,785
Male Narrator:
What will happen, indeed?

190
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:17,331
Female Narrator:
Are you done? Can I tell
my side of the story now?

191
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:20,792
Male Narrator:
If you must. Go on..

192
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:28,258
Female Narrator:
In a faraway land,
all eyes were on Apple

193
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:33,680
as she made the most important
declaration of her life.

194
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,684
I am Apple White,
daughter of Snow White.

195
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:41,062
And I am ready
to pledge my destiny.

196
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,647
- (crowd cheers)
- (record scratches)

197
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,024
Male Narrator:
Of course you'd start
with Apple,

198
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,775
always playing favorites.

199
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,902
Start at the beginning
of the school year.

200
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,696
Female Narrator:
Oh, fine.

201
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,740
Gather 'round, friends,
and let us tell you a story,

202
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,910
the story of
Ever After High.

203
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,745
- (grunts)
- A high school

204
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,831
- for the teenage sons
and daughters...
- Hmph.

205
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,333
of the most famous
fairy-tale characters

206
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,751
- who ever lived.
- (growls)

207
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,462
Female Narrator:
But this year
was like no other

208
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,172
for the students
of Ever After High.

209
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:15,096
For it is
the year of Legacy Day,

210
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,724
a momentous event
where the students

211
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,268
pledge to all
the magical world

212
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:25,940
to follow the same paths
as their fairy-tale parents.

213
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,110
I can't believe it.
Legacy happens this year

214
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,112
and there is just
ever so much to do.

215
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,613
Totally, right?

216
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:36,617
I mean, this year's
after-party is gonna
be a page ripper.

217
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:39,287
- I heard D.J. N-Chant is...
- Briar.

218
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,206
It's not just
about the party.

219
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,790
This is destiny.

220
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,584
Future queen!

221
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,337
We can't let anyone post
embarrassing pictures of us
on MyChapter.

222
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,589
Hey, daughter
of Sleeping Beauty.

223
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,133
If I'm gonna be catching "z's"
for a hundred years,

224
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,219
I got to live it up now.

225
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,345
And come on.

226
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,180
No one would post
anything bad about you.

227
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,973
Everybody loves you.

228
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,808
It's Apple White.
(sighs)

229
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,810
(sighs)

230
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,811
Gorgeous.

231
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,021
(bleat)

232
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,399
Tiny:
Can I carry your books?

233
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,277
Why, Tiny, aren't you
the sweetest little thing?

234
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,486
Thank you.

235
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,654
See? They love you.
Oh, oh.

236
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,490
I don't want to miss a minute
of our first day.

237
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,200
- Hi, everybody.
- (happy murmurs)

238
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,826
Briar:
Hey, what's up?
Howdy.

239
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,037
- (laughs)
- Hey, Prince Daring.

240
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,706
Um, why are you holding
your hand over your mouth?

241
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,000
Well, you see, I just
got my teeth whitened.

242
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,003
And Headmaster Grimm said
I can't show people, 'cause...

243
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,672
But your smile
is so charming.

244
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,134
- Well, you know...
- Ah! My eyes!

245
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,927
I can't see!
Ah!

246
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,179
- Tiny:
I'm okay.
- (laughing)

247
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,308
- Apple, Daring...
- (clicks tongue)

248
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:45,895
So any juicy dating details
for my mirror-cast show?

249
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,188
Talk to the mirror.

250
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,191
Blondie, Daring and I
are still not a couple.

251
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,401
This is high school.

252
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,195
We've got "forever after"
to be together.

253
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,073
But you two are
the perfect couple...

254
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,326
not too this,
not too that.

255
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,202
You're just right.

256
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,413
Come on, Apple.
Let's go get some lunch.

257
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,123
Charm you later.

258
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,000
Oh, oh.
(giggle)

259
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,003
Female Narrator:
And so that night,

260
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,963
back in the Ever After dorms,

261
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:15,133
Apple had a surprise waiting
for her new roommate.

262
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,843
You think Raven's
gonna like this?

263
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,094
Of course.

264
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,180
What future evil queen
wouldn't love...

265
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,434
an evil throne, an evil crown,
and an evil haunted mirror?

266
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:27,521
True, but why are you
doing this for Raven?

267
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,565
Because she's such
an important part
of <i>my</i> story.</i>

268
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:33,485
When she poisons me,
it changes everything.

269
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:36,695
Then the Prince can wake me
and I become queen.

270
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,990
That's when I get
my "happily ever after."

271
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,200
I need her.

272
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,993
- Raven:
Hey, Maddie?
- (knocking)

273
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,411
Uh, quick, hide.

274
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,829
I don't want Raven to know
you helped me.

275
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:45,997
I'll go out the window.

276
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,457
I've never done that before.

277
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,459
(giggles) Whee!

278
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,048
Welcome home, roomie.

279
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,757
Huh, good one, Apple.

280
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,510
I'm rooming with Maddie
this year.

281
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,012
- Not anymore.
- Huh?

282
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,305
Man!

283
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,849
- I am good-looking.
- Whee!

284
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,602
Daring, how'd you know
I was gonna be here?

285
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,145
Catching damsels
in distress...

286
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,689
it's kind of my thing.

287
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:13,608
Well, that was a total rush!

288
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,193
Stay here.
I'm going again!

289
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,403
(giggles)

290
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,779
Hey, you want to get
a Hocus Latte?

291
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,408
Uh, that sounds magical.
I love mine with nutmeg.

292
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,742
- How do you like yours?
- Oh, I like a lotta,

293
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,245
lotta, lotta,
lotta, lotta cream.

294
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:27,872
(giggles)

295
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,165
- Hey.
- Hi, Ashlynn.

296
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,376
Want to go on
a nature hike later?

297
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,211
I haven't been
in the woods in days?

298
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:36,005
And it just feels so good
to get back to what really
matters.

299
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,048
(goose honks)

300
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,174
I got a shipment here

301
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,594
of 300 new shoes
for the Glass Slipper.

302
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,721
New shoes?!

303
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:44,347
(squeals)
Where?

304
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,682
(honks)

305
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,141
(geese honking)

306
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:53,147
(gasping and giggling)

307
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,149
It's a shoe thing.

308
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,902
Well, she is
Cinderella's daughter.

309
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,572
(bells chime)

310
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,574
Ooh, time for our
Legacy Day rehearsal.

311
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,200
I can't wait for everyone

312
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,412
to get a glimpse of the queen
I am going to become.

313
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,705
(goose honks)

314
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,249
(giggles)

315
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,667
Female Narrator:
But what Apple didn't know

316
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,754
was that Raven Queen
had other plans...

317
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,589
Male Narrator:
That would change
the world

318
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,090
- for the better.
- For the worse.

319
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,967
So when your magical key
appears,

320
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,886
you insert it gently
into the Storybook of Legends,

321
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:28,933
then stand shoulders back
and declare your destiny
to the world.

322
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,101
Have I made myself clear?

323
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,103
- But what if...
- No questions? Good.

324
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,812
Who will go first?

325
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,106
Ooh, me, me, me.

326
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,484
- Mm, ah, ooh, ooh.
- Step right this way,

327
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,277
my future queen.

328
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,488
I am Apple White.

329
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:45,824
And I pledge to
follow my destiny
as the next Snow White.

330
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:48,286
- Perfect.
- I know.

331
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,497
I am Briar Beauty.

332
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,792
And I pledge to follow
in my mom's footsteps

333
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,294
and sleep for
a hundred years.

334
00:13:56,294 --> 00:14:00,131
But before I do,
I'm gonna live every minute!

335
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,966
Ooh, speaking of which,

336
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:05,052
my dorm room Friday night,
we're gonna blow the roof
off the place.

337
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,262
Milton Grimm:
Next.

338
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,974
Hey, there.
Charming, Daring Charming.

339
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:14,312
I pledge to be just
like my old man, King Charming.

340
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,314
Brave, good-looking,

341
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,692
kind, good-looking,

342
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,777
thoughtful,
and good-looking.

343
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:21,986
- (clicks tongue)
- Next.

344
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,113
I'm Raven Queen.

345
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,826
And I pledge to
follow my destiny as...

346
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,994
Um, I have a question.

347
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,038
What is it?

348
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,832
I was just wondering,
I mean,

349
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:37,502
what if I don't want
to take the pledge?

350
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:38,670
(gasps)

351
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,463
(gasps)

352
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,048
She has to do it.

353
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,967
I mean, if she never
poisons me, then I'll
never fall asleep.

354
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,803
And I'll never be kissed
by my Prince.

355
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,304
And I'll never become queen.

356
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,391
And I'll never have
my "happily ever after."

357
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,685
Now, Raven,

358
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:56,396
erase that dangerous
idea from your head.

359
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,605
Continue.

360
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,234
I have to go.

361
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,194
- What?
- Hey, what about her destiny?

362
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:06,531
The rules...
I mean, the rules!

363
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,908
Female Narrator:
And so Apple took
refuge that night

364
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,869
in the enchanted forest,

365
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,496
- (cries)
- wondering what would
become of her destiny

366
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,915
should Raven not follow hers.

367
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,208
(gasps)

368
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,752
Headmaster Grimm?

369
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,671
Forgive me for
startling you, my dear.

370
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:26,050
I need you to keep an eye
on your roommate, Raven.

371
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,887
We must follow the paths
set out before us.

372
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:32,724
It's the only way to keep
our world safe.

373
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,726
Please, watch Raven

374
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:37,061
and convince her of this.

375
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:40,398
I know you'll do
whatever it takes.

376
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,734
I'll...

377
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,111
Female Narrator:
And so...

378
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:49,115
on the grave portent about
to befall Ever After High...

379
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:52,159
Male Narrator:
Must you always be so dramatic?

380
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,246
Female Narrator:
Must you always ruin
my ominous endings?

381
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,373
Male Narrator:
You're always taking
the Royals' side.

382
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,333
Female Narrator:
I mean, I'm known
for my endings.

383
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:08,259
Female Narrator:
And so here we are...
Legacy Day,

384
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:11,471
where the students
of Ever After High signed

385
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:15,057
the Storybook of Legends,
pledging to follow

386
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,102
the paths
of their fairy-tale parents.

387
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,353
Male Narrator:
Or not.

388
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,397
Female Narrator:
Seriously? I'm narrating here.

389
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,234
(sighs)
Maddie, you have to help me.

390
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,613
I don't feel like I can
sign the Storybook of Legends,

391
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,157
but I don't want
to let everyone down, either.

392
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,910
And do not forget the whole,
"If you don't sign,

393
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,620
your story disappears.
Poof!

394
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,497
And you may vanish
into oblivion."

395
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,791
(gasps)
That's a thing, you know,
and it's gotta hurt.

396
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,125
But we don't know
if that's true.

397
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,710
- But what if it is?
- But what if it's not?

398
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,754
- But what if it is?
- You're not helping.

399
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,006
Wait a tick.

400
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,883
<i>♪ I think I know
who can help! ♪</i>

401
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,138
No, but see...
I am totally a Royal.

402
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,389
(locker door slams)
Raven!

403
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,392
There you are.
We have to talk.

404
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,394
Come back!

405
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,772
Apple, where are
you going?

406
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,566
I have to convince Raven
to sign the book.

407
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,361
My destiny depends on it.

408
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,744
(breathing heavily)

409
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,579
(knocking)

410
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:22,041
(gasps)
(door opens)

411
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,919
Raven?
(echoing)

412
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,797
If anyone knows the truth
about the Storybook of Legends,

413
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,049
it's Giles Grimm.

414
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,969
Feathers and friends,
together, alone.

415
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,428
He's speaking Riddlish.

416
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,347
He was cursed
with a babble spell.

417
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,182
Makes him sound. you know,
bru-ru-ru, cuckoo.

418
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,101
He says it's nice
to have us here.

419
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,395
Ask him about the book.

420
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,565
If I don't sign,
am I really gonna... disappear?

421
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,609
Mm-hmm. Can a musical chair
change its tone

422
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,320
when the tablet of granite
is inscribed with a bone?

423
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,157
Hmm. The king who sings
with pages of sky

424
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:59,203
fears too much the dawn
that rises with lies.

425
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,789
He says there's
something wrong with the book,

426
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,499
and that if you don't sign,

427
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,125
your story... will...

428
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,963
What? What?!
(splashing)

429
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,339
Oh, sorry.

430
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,133
If you don't sign,
your story will continue.

431
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,803
Ah, really?
Oh, that's great.

432
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:16,804
I think.

433
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,472
Uhh! You think?

434
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,851
Hey! Riddlish is not
an exact language.

435
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,730
Female Narrator:
At last it was Legacy Day.

436
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,649
Next we have
Apple White.

437
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,986
(cheering and applause)

438
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:37,283
I am Apple White,
daughter of Snow White,

439
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:41,454
and I am ready to pledge
my destiny.

440
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,415
(clicking)

441
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,771
(cheering and applause)

442
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,189
(lips smacking)

443
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,820
And next, Raven Queen.

444
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,737
(thunder crashes)

445
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:23,663
I am Raven Queen,
daughter of the evil queen,

446
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:28,167
and... I pledge...
uh... I...

447
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,877
Come on, do it!

448
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:33,380
(sighs)

449
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,095
(clicking)

450
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,186
(gasps)

451
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,192
Ohh!

452
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:07,414
I am Raven Queen,

453
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,584
and I'm going to write
my own destiny.

454
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:15,006
My "happily ever after"
starts now.

455
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:17,299
(shattering)

456
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,759
Oh, no!
(murmuring)

457
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,636
(cheering)
Yay!

458
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:21,971
Raven did it!

459
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,641
(sighing)

460
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,394
I'm still here.
I didn't disappear.

461
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:33,691
How could you be so...
so selfish?

462
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:34,859
All:
Boo!

463
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,069
All:
Yay!

464
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:40,073
I'm sorry, Apple,
but I... oh!

465
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,448
Ahh!

466
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:44,326
Hold everything!

467
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,786
(booing stops)

468
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:48,831
Raven:
Ohh...

469
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:52,210
I didn't know
I could do that.

470
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,211
(gasps)

471
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,550
I'm sorry, Apple,

472
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,220
but I don't want anyone
to tell me who to be.

473
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,471
I want to figure that out
on my own.

474
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,306
And don't you understand?

475
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,226
I'm not the only one

476
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:10,394
who gets to choose
their own destiny now.

477
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,522
We all do... even you.

478
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,234
But I don't want to choose
a new destiny.

479
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:18,652
I liked the one I had,

480
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,447
and because of you
it might not happen.

481
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:22,823
But it might.

482
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:23,616
(sobbing)

483
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,159
I don't know.

484
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,995
I... I just don't know.

485
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,835
Wow!

486
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:39,257
You're still here.
No poof, poof, poof. Yay!

487
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:42,676
I know. It feels good.

488
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,137
Male Narrator:
Life between the Royals
and the Rebels

489
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:46,388
at Ever After High
would never be the same

490
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,975
after Raven stood up
for what she believed.

491
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,434
Female Narrator:
What she believed was wrong.

492
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,979
She didn't honor her destiny.
She tempted fate.

493
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:57,942
Listen, narrators, we are trying
to have a nice moment here.

494
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,110
(giggling)

495
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,402
(thunder crashes)

496
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,697
Raven does not know
the forces she has released.

497
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,407
This must be contained

498
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,576
before her dangerous idea
spreads.

499
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:12,581
(evil laughing)

500
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,292
(thunder crashes)

501
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,669
(fairy-tale theme music)
