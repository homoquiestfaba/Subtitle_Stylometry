1
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,429
Okay, ready?

2
00:00:56,936 --> 00:00:59,457
Whee!

3
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:22,049
That was so great.

4
00:01:22,217 --> 00:01:24,159
- Yeah, let's go again.
- Okay.

5
00:01:29,513 --> 00:01:30,626
It's a tie.

6
00:01:33,449 --> 00:01:34,726
- Ready?
- Yeah.

7
00:01:46,025 --> 00:01:47,935
Come on, Bobby, let's go again.

8
00:02:51,628 --> 00:02:52,806
We'll call you when we get there.

9
00:02:52,876 --> 00:02:55,265
Don't you worry about a thing.
We'll get the lease to the realtor.

10
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,381
- Take care.
- Okay. You, too.

11
00:02:57,773 --> 00:02:59,431
- We'll be in touch.
- Yeah.

12
00:03:02,701 --> 00:03:03,649
See you.

13
00:03:05,037 --> 00:03:06,695
Yeah, see you.

14
00:03:09,645 --> 00:03:12,133
I guess you're ready. In you get.

15
00:03:12,589 --> 00:03:13,799
Buckle up.

16
00:03:14,221 --> 00:03:15,268
Bye.

17
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:19,083
- Okay, call us when you get there.
- Yeah, we will.

18
00:03:19,725 --> 00:03:20,903
Safe trip.

19
00:03:39,278 --> 00:03:42,344
Come on, Jess. Let's go home, sweetie.

20
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,582
Jess?

21
00:04:26,192 --> 00:04:27,272
Jessie?

22
00:04:29,487 --> 00:04:31,659
Honey, Derek Tynan's here to see you.

23
00:04:32,016 --> 00:04:34,121
Do you want to go sledding with him?

24
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:38,375
It's a beautiful day out,
and you love sledding.

25
00:04:38,448 --> 00:04:39,626
With Bobby.

26
00:04:40,016 --> 00:04:43,945
Sweetie, I know you're sad,
but you can't stay in here forever.

27
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,314
Leave me alone.

28
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:53,100
- Not today, Derek.
- Oh, okay.

29
00:04:53,232 --> 00:04:54,923
Try again later, okay?

30
00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:06,666
Good.

31
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:09,769
Oh, the tree looks wonderful.

32
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:11,177
Good.

33
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:13,486
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

34
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:17,197
- So, has Jess had any dinner at all?
- No.

35
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,047
She just needs time.

36
00:05:19,217 --> 00:05:21,105
It's been almost a week.

37
00:05:21,298 --> 00:05:24,298
Bob, she's heartbroken, and she's ten.

38
00:05:24,946 --> 00:05:28,361
It took you three years
to get over Greg Sewell moving away...

39
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,283
and you were 27.

40
00:05:32,146 --> 00:05:35,408
Well, it's not going to be
a very merry Christmas around here.

41
00:05:36,723 --> 00:05:37,671
What?

42
00:05:37,843 --> 00:05:40,232
- I have an idea.
- What?

43
00:05:40,594 --> 00:05:44,424
Well, I think she's herding kangaroos
in the Australian outback...

44
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:46,604
No, that was last month.

45
00:05:46,898 --> 00:05:49,354
She's hot-air ballooning
over the geti right now.

46
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:52,394
No, please, anybody but...

47
00:05:53,267 --> 00:05:54,860
- Aunt Millie.
- Aunt Millie.

48
00:05:54,931 --> 00:05:58,989
Beautiful Bethy. How's my only niece?

49
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:02,507
I'm fine, Aunt Millie. I'm so glad you came.

50
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:03,692
Hello, Aunt Millie.

51
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,422
- Bill.
- Bob.

52
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:08,208
- Okay, Bill Bob.
- Just plain Bob.

53
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:12,236
Oh, be a dear, Plain Bob,
there's a little more in the car.

54
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:13,896
Come on in.

55
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:22,927
Lordy Lord,
Christmas is a time for faith and family...

56
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,043
and presents and turkey.

57
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:28,692
- Is it Christmas here yet?
- No, it's tomorrow.

58
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:31,888
Then I made it with just a breath to spare.

59
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:36,458
Jessie, there's someone very special here
to see you.

60
00:06:37,493 --> 00:06:38,441
Bobby?

61
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:41,547
No, honey, it's Aunt Millie,
all the way from Africa.

62
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,492
Oh, hi, Aunt Millie.

63
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:48,558
Aren't you going to give
your old auntie a hug?

64
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:55,214
Oh, my, this can't be my Jessie...

65
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:57,652
so beautiful and so sad.

66
00:06:58,997 --> 00:07:03,121
Come, you tell your Aunt Millie
all about the hurt in your heart.

67
00:07:04,086 --> 00:07:07,217
- Mind making some lunch, Bethy?
- Sure. No problem.

68
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,510
There, there.

69
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:15,253
And do you know something?
I know exactly how you feel.

70
00:07:15,318 --> 00:07:18,252
- No, you don't.
- Oh, but I do.

71
00:07:18,422 --> 00:07:21,073
You feel like you're all alone in the world...

72
00:07:21,462 --> 00:07:25,008
and there's this huge hole in your heart.

73
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,750
And no matter how hard you try,
it just won't go away.

74
00:07:29,303 --> 00:07:30,732
- Is it like that?
- Uh-huh.

75
00:07:31,831 --> 00:07:36,370
Oh, suffering sainthood, we can't have
you feeling this way at Christmas.

76
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,705
Oh, what to do?

77
00:07:41,847 --> 00:07:45,905
There's always... No, that won't do.

78
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:49,778
Or we could go... No, that's too far.

79
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:52,116
There must be something.

80
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:57,740
Yes, I have it.

81
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,072
- What?
- The story.

82
00:08:01,463 --> 00:08:02,641
What story?

83
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:06,388
Oh, only the story of
one of the greatest friendships ever...

84
00:08:06,455 --> 00:08:09,903
that has the power
to heal your broken heart.

85
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,229
Oh, but you probably
don't want to hear a story.

86
00:08:13,304 --> 00:08:15,922
Yes, yes, please, Aunt Millie,
tell me the story.

87
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:19,441
Okay.

88
00:08:21,112 --> 00:08:25,106
But first,
you have to answer a simple question.

89
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:26,544
What?

90
00:08:27,128 --> 00:08:29,430
Do you believe in Santa Claus?

91
00:08:31,353 --> 00:08:35,510
You know, some people
don't believe in Santa, or magic...

92
00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:38,870
or much of anything these days.

93
00:08:38,937 --> 00:08:40,726
So, you know...

94
00:08:41,657 --> 00:08:46,000
it'll be perfectly pointless telling
them the most magical story ever.

95
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:51,350
I think I believe.

96
00:08:51,993 --> 00:08:56,249
Excellent. Now you sit back and
make yourself as comfortable as you can.

97
00:08:57,786 --> 00:08:59,696
Oh, this is wonderful.

98
00:08:59,994 --> 00:09:01,336
Throw me a pillow.

99
00:09:03,034 --> 00:09:04,212
Thank you.

100
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:09,493
Now, many, many years ago, there was
this little girl called Katie Andrews...

101
00:09:09,562 --> 00:09:10,903
she was about your age.

102
00:09:10,971 --> 00:09:12,564
I just turned ten.

103
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:15,888
Jumping jimminy, so was Katie.

104
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:22,426
She was a wonderfully sensitive
and spirited little girl...

105
00:09:23,035 --> 00:09:25,490
but her life was less than ideal.

106
00:09:26,075 --> 00:09:27,417
And with good reason.

107
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:31,956
<i>You see, she lived in the shadow of her
two obnoxious brothers, Jack and Joe...</i>

108
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:35,702
<i>and she felt awfully alone.</i>

109
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,351
- Here we go, now.
- Give it back!

110
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:44,696
Hold on, I'm coming, I'm coming.

111
00:09:44,764 --> 00:09:46,105
Fun's over, boys.

112
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:02,738
Now then,
winter was Katie's favorite time of the year...

113
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:04,667
because she loved one thing...

114
00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:08,410
more than anything else
in the whole wide world...

115
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:09,910
skating.

116
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,038
You are wearing the wrong kind of skates.

117
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:05,536
Katie.

118
00:12:15,137 --> 00:12:16,893
It's time for dinner, honey.

119
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:19,871
Oh, he's very good.

120
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,282
I wish I could skate like that.

121
00:12:27,362 --> 00:12:28,442
Hello.

122
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:33,759
Oh, my goodness, you're Otto Brewer.

123
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,672
Yes, I know. You are this girl's mother?

124
00:12:36,738 --> 00:12:37,883
I'm Sarah Andrews.

125
00:12:37,954 --> 00:12:40,888
Katie, you didn't tell me
Otto Brewer was skating here.

126
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,579
He won the gold medal in the Olympics.

127
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,017
Oh, that was a longtime ago.

128
00:12:46,627 --> 00:12:49,758
- What is your name?
- Katie Andrews, sir.

129
00:12:49,826 --> 00:12:51,931
I have watched you, Katie.

130
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,459
Do you want to learn proper skating?

131
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,376
Then I will teach you.

132
00:12:57,475 --> 00:13:00,192
Because I cannot abide what you are doing.

133
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:03,041
Oh, that's very generous of you,
Mr. Brewer, but...

134
00:13:04,003 --> 00:13:05,018
But what?

135
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:07,068
Speak up, but what?

136
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:09,627
We couldn't afford to...

137
00:13:10,531 --> 00:13:12,319
Did I ask for payment?

138
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:15,164
No, I did not.

139
00:13:15,363 --> 00:13:18,909
What I'm asking is permission
to teach her proper skating.

140
00:13:21,603 --> 00:13:23,513
Then good.

141
00:13:23,716 --> 00:13:26,018
I only require two things...

142
00:13:26,116 --> 00:13:28,985
one, you will do what I'm asking, yes?

143
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,997
And you will get her proper skates.

144
00:13:32,068 --> 00:13:33,213
Papa!

145
00:13:33,923 --> 00:13:35,582
Come on, Papa.

146
00:13:36,868 --> 00:13:39,323
He would stay out here all night if he could.

147
00:13:39,396 --> 00:13:41,152
Oh, I have one of those, too.

148
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,642
This is Alexandra,
my troublesome daughter.

149
00:13:43,717 --> 00:13:46,499
She thinks I'm too old to be on the ice.

150
00:13:47,205 --> 00:13:49,790
This is Katie Andrews and her mother.

151
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,453
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

152
00:13:51,524 --> 00:13:54,688
- Katie is going to be my student.
- Student?

153
00:13:55,077 --> 00:13:57,052
Yes, student!

154
00:13:57,861 --> 00:14:00,763
You wanted to go, now we go.

155
00:14:01,605 --> 00:14:03,296
See you tomorrow, Katie.

156
00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:05,243
Proper skates.

157
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:09,947
Proper skates.

158
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,895
You should have seen her out there today.

159
00:14:20,965 --> 00:14:23,486
You know, her birthday's coming,
we could get her figure skates.

160
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:25,729
Sarah, we're barely getting by now.

161
00:14:25,862 --> 00:14:28,034
Ted, if it was the boys, we'd find a way.

162
00:14:28,102 --> 00:14:30,306
Look, sit down a minute.

163
00:14:32,678 --> 00:14:34,850
I didn't want to mention this, but...

164
00:14:35,398 --> 00:14:38,115
I did hear a rumor
there may be more layoffs soon.

165
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,450
Really?

166
00:14:40,998 --> 00:14:43,387
But it is just a rumor.

167
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:51,965
<i>- Come on, Katie, make a wish.
- Yeah, a wish.</i>

168
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:53,152
Make a wish, honey.

169
00:14:58,855 --> 00:15:00,481
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

170
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:02,885
- How come she gets such a big present?
- Yeah, how come?

171
00:15:02,952 --> 00:15:04,478
Because it's her birthday.

172
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:05,533
It's not fair.

173
00:15:05,607 --> 00:15:08,128
Pipe down, boys,
let your sister open her gift.

174
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,363
Yellow skates?

175
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:18,082
They're used,
but at least they're not hockey skates.

176
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:20,039
Now you'll be
a champion figure skater for sure.

177
00:15:20,104 --> 00:15:22,525
- Happy Birthday, sweetheart.
- Happy Birthday.

178
00:15:22,984 --> 00:15:24,511
They're banana skates!

179
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,458
Look at me,
I'm racing on my new banana skates!

180
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:29,959
Ooh, I'm Katie skating.

181
00:15:30,824 --> 00:15:32,199
Boys, stop it now.

182
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,728
Yellow skates.

183
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:40,840
<i>Yellow skates?</i>

184
00:15:41,737 --> 00:15:43,842
Yellow would be, like, totally ick.

185
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:48,159
Maybe to you, but to Katie...

186
00:15:48,873 --> 00:15:51,775
they were the most beautiful skates
she had ever seen.

187
00:16:45,483 --> 00:16:47,850
Inside edge.

188
00:16:50,507 --> 00:16:54,085
Who has ever heard of yellow skates?

189
00:16:57,036 --> 00:16:58,213
Ugly.

190
00:16:59,212 --> 00:17:02,441
<i>Now, as it happens,
Otto was not the only one...</i>

191
00:17:02,507 --> 00:17:05,257
<i>having a big problem
with the way things looked.</i>

192
00:17:06,155 --> 00:17:09,287
<i>One winter night, far away
at the North Pole...</i>

193
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,427
<i>Santa's village was in a tizzy...</i>

194
00:17:11,499 --> 00:17:14,729
<i>over the news of a very unusual arrival.</i>

195
00:17:20,237 --> 00:17:21,382
Step aside.

196
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,614
Make a path, that's what I would suggest.

197
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:27,621
That's it. That's right. Be out of my way.

198
00:17:29,356 --> 00:17:31,299
Are you sitting or working, huh?

199
00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:35,139
Don't read them, just sort them.

200
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,806
Thank you.

201
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:46,721
Santa.

202
00:17:47,245 --> 00:17:48,194
Santa?

203
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:49,986
Santa.

204
00:17:52,173 --> 00:17:53,417
Santa, wake up!

205
00:17:54,894 --> 00:17:56,803
Come quickly.
There is something you must see.

206
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:58,535
You're feeling sickly and hurt your knee?

207
00:17:58,605 --> 00:18:00,296
No, see, see.

208
00:18:00,973 --> 00:18:02,184
Hurry, follow me.

209
00:18:02,254 --> 00:18:04,163
What furry hollow tree?

210
00:18:04,653 --> 00:18:06,312
Santa, there is a crisis!

211
00:18:06,606 --> 00:18:08,428
You don't need to yell,
you don't need to yell.

212
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,579
Crisis, you say? What crisis?

213
00:18:13,198 --> 00:18:16,013
Blitzen and Delphi had the baby.

214
00:18:19,374 --> 00:18:21,349
But that's not a crisis...

215
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:23,046
that's wonderful news.

216
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:25,832
Wonderful news!

217
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,721
After all this while...

218
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,530
it's high time they heard
the clatter of little hooves.

219
00:18:32,591 --> 00:18:35,755
What are we doing standing here?
Let's go see him.

220
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:38,958
You may want to hold the jolly, sir.

221
00:18:39,023 --> 00:18:41,706
The him is a her, and that's not all.

222
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:43,947
You say she's in the Great Hall?
What's she doing there?

223
00:18:44,015 --> 00:18:45,640
She should be in the paddock.

224
00:18:45,711 --> 00:18:47,500
Yes, of course.

225
00:18:48,431 --> 00:18:49,479
After you.

226
00:19:04,048 --> 00:19:05,870
All right, clear the way.

227
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,206
Enough gawking, it's not a petting zoo.

228
00:19:08,784 --> 00:19:10,191
Blitzen.

229
00:19:11,793 --> 00:19:13,003
Hi, boss.

230
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:15,403
- Congratulations, old boy.
- Thanks, Santa.

231
00:19:15,472 --> 00:19:16,967
I hope you're not disappointed.

232
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:17,989
Sir.

233
00:19:23,953 --> 00:19:25,294
Oh, my.

234
00:19:26,961 --> 00:19:28,816
Oh, my, oh, my.

235
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:32,525
Isn't she...

236
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:35,921
Yes, yes, but what is that there on her head?

237
00:19:36,017 --> 00:19:40,589
Well, that's... She's not exactly...

238
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,274
she's certainly a lovely little...

239
00:19:43,441 --> 00:19:45,929
Oh, she looks like a pony. Please.

240
00:19:46,002 --> 00:19:48,904
Besides. Blitzen and Delphi
were hoping for a boy to take over...

241
00:19:48,978 --> 00:19:51,661
for Blitzen in his position in the sled
when he retires.

242
00:19:51,729 --> 00:19:53,802
As you can see, now this is impossible!

243
00:19:53,874 --> 00:19:57,900
Well, you may have a point there,
however, there are other ways...

244
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,075
to contribute to the community.

245
00:20:00,146 --> 00:20:02,448
We each have our own talents.

246
00:20:02,514 --> 00:20:04,369
We're going to have to assemble
a full Council.

247
00:20:04,434 --> 00:20:07,850
We need a name.
Now let me see, something appropriate.

248
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:09,995
We'll never get a Council in this blizzard,
of course.

249
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:12,619
That's it, Blizzard.

250
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:14,927
- That's it.
- That's what?

251
00:20:14,995 --> 00:20:16,882
- Well done, Archimedes.
- What have I done?

252
00:20:16,946 --> 00:20:18,157
It's a wonderful name.

253
00:20:18,227 --> 00:20:21,162
Blizzard. Delphi,
what do you think of Blizzard?

254
00:20:21,331 --> 00:20:22,990
It's wonderful.

255
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:27,345
Yes might I remind, Santa...

256
00:20:27,411 --> 00:20:30,542
that any new reindeer name
must be approved by the Council.

257
00:20:30,643 --> 00:20:33,807
Yes, and Archimedes,
may I remind you that Blizzard...

258
00:20:34,195 --> 00:20:36,497
is the daughter of Blitzen and Delphi...

259
00:20:36,563 --> 00:20:40,557
and the granddaughter of Sirius, one of
the greatest flyers ever.

260
00:20:40,691 --> 00:20:43,408
And she is to be given
all the love and respect...

261
00:20:43,636 --> 00:20:45,523
that her lineage deserves.

262
00:20:47,411 --> 00:20:50,346
No matter how different she looks.

263
00:20:51,156 --> 00:20:53,392
Indeed. Well said, Delphi.

264
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,074
Well, Blitzen?

265
00:21:01,749 --> 00:21:05,643
So, behold Blizzard.

266
00:21:06,645 --> 00:21:10,573
In accordance with our tradition,
I declare her to be...

267
00:21:10,964 --> 00:21:14,445
a full member of the herd.

268
00:21:26,069 --> 00:21:28,557
Welcome, Blizzard.

269
00:21:29,494 --> 00:21:31,403
May you live long, little one...

270
00:21:32,406 --> 00:21:36,628
and contribute mightily to the work
that is ours and ours alone.

271
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:43,473
All right, the fuss is over, back to work.

272
00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:47,955
<i>But the fuss Blizzard
would cause was only just beginning...</i>

273
00:21:48,022 --> 00:21:50,640
<i>as was Archimedes' dislike for her.</i>

274
00:21:51,222 --> 00:21:54,091
<i>You see, he lived for order, rules.</i>

275
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:57,133
No, I'm not questioning your
effectiveness at your job.

276
00:21:57,206 --> 00:21:59,792
On the contrary,
you made things run very smoothly.

277
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:00,844
Thank you.

278
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:03,090
I shudder to think
what would happen if we fail to meet...

279
00:22:03,158 --> 00:22:04,981
even one of my timetables.

280
00:22:05,047 --> 00:22:08,429
Chaos. Not to mention
thousands upon thousands of children...

281
00:22:08,502 --> 00:22:10,063
very disappointed come Christmas morning.

282
00:22:10,135 --> 00:22:11,662
Oh, we can't have that.

283
00:22:11,927 --> 00:22:14,961
No, I believe it is the rules that make
Christmas happen!

284
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:20,592
"Rules make Christmas happen."
That's a lovely new slogan.

285
00:22:20,663 --> 00:22:22,606
Oh, no blow guns, too dangerous.

286
00:22:28,887 --> 00:22:32,662
<i>The months flew by.
And as December approached...</i>

287
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:34,997
<i>it seemed that everyone in Santa's village...</i>

288
00:22:35,064 --> 00:22:38,861
<i>had just one thing
on their minds: Christmas.</i>

289
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,397
<i>Santa's reindeer were going out each day,
practicing for the big night.</i>

290
00:22:45,816 --> 00:22:49,013
That's my girl. Blitzen, looking good!

291
00:22:49,336 --> 00:22:53,843
Okay, Prancer, come on, baby, make that
nice turn. Yes! Keep your head up!

292
00:22:53,913 --> 00:22:56,913
<i>And when it came to
getting into the Christmas spirit...</i>

293
00:22:57,112 --> 00:22:59,217
<i>Blizzard was no exception.</i>

294
00:23:03,577 --> 00:23:06,196
- Hey, good morning, Aphrodite.
- What's so good about it?

295
00:23:06,265 --> 00:23:08,534
Just look around, it's a beautiful day.

296
00:23:08,761 --> 00:23:11,696
Smell her.
Who does she think she is anyway?

297
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:14,744
This is a team game,
so if one goes down, what?

298
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:16,369
We all go down.

299
00:23:16,441 --> 00:23:17,390
All go down.

300
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:19,286
Tell me about it.

301
00:23:19,353 --> 00:23:20,914
Hey, have any of you guys tried flying yet?

302
00:23:20,985 --> 00:23:22,065
I tried on my dad's harness.

303
00:23:22,137 --> 00:23:24,504
- How'd that go?
- I got a little lightheaded.

304
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,518
Cool.

305
00:23:25,594 --> 00:23:27,219
You guys wanna try flying with me?

306
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:29,046
Actually, we're doing guy stuff.

307
00:23:29,114 --> 00:23:31,383
- Blizzard, hi.
- Hey Donner, Jr.

308
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,003
I told you, we're doing guy stuff.
No girls allowed.

309
00:23:34,074 --> 00:23:35,830
You don't have to be so mean about it.

310
00:23:35,898 --> 00:23:38,746
- We don't want you here.
- Well then, I'll just leave.

311
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:41,232
Wow. Unbelievable.

312
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:42,745
- How is it down there?
- This is incredible!

313
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,304
I can't believe it! I can't fly.

314
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,036
Oh, well, boys, see you.

315
00:23:46,107 --> 00:23:48,889
This isn't fair, I'm calling my dad.
Where do you think you're going?

316
00:23:48,954 --> 00:23:51,736
Guys, I've got to go.

317
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:55,409
Blizzard, hey, wait up.

318
00:23:55,578 --> 00:23:58,578
Hey look, I'm on all fours here. Slow down.

319
00:23:58,651 --> 00:24:00,691
Blizzard, come on, not so fast.
Give me a break.

320
00:24:00,763 --> 00:24:01,973
Oh, hi, Donner Jr.

321
00:24:02,043 --> 00:24:04,857
- Blizzard, you can really fly.
- Yeah.

322
00:24:04,923 --> 00:24:06,003
How do you do that?

323
00:24:06,075 --> 00:24:10,232
I just think "up,"
and the next thing I know, I'm up in the air.

324
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,984
What's the matter? Come on, try it.

325
00:24:13,404 --> 00:24:16,371
So you just say to yourself, "up,"
and you go up?

326
00:24:16,603 --> 00:24:17,978
Pretty much.

327
00:24:18,044 --> 00:24:20,116
I'm still kind of grounded here, Blizzard.

328
00:24:20,187 --> 00:24:22,675
I don't know.
Maybe you're thinking too much.

329
00:24:22,907 --> 00:24:25,111
Don't think about it, just try it.

330
00:24:25,404 --> 00:24:26,811
Come on.

331
00:24:26,876 --> 00:24:29,364
Don't think about it, just fly.
Don't think about it, just fly.

332
00:24:33,565 --> 00:24:35,091
I almost had it.

333
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,653
Come on, catch me if you can.

334
00:24:37,757 --> 00:24:40,757
Blizzard, slow down, no, wait.
I'm coming. I'm coming, okay?

335
00:24:40,829 --> 00:24:44,603
Blizzard, slow down. Oh, my God! I'm flying!

336
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:46,043
I'm flying!

337
00:24:47,901 --> 00:24:51,196
Wow, I flew! Wait until my dad hears!

338
00:24:51,837 --> 00:24:53,659
<i>Well, at about that time...</i>

339
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:57,337
<i>Blizzard and Donner Jr.
weren't the only ones taking off.</i>

340
00:24:57,533 --> 00:24:59,256
<i>So was Katie...</i>

341
00:24:59,517 --> 00:25:01,721
<i>who, under the watchful eye of Otto...</i>

342
00:25:01,981 --> 00:25:04,916
<i>was skating like never before.</i>

343
00:25:05,502 --> 00:25:07,357
<i>And with each day...</i>

344
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:11,513
<i>gaining more of the confidence
she'd felt only in her dreams.</i>

345
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:20,088
Katie, you are ready.

346
00:25:21,662 --> 00:25:24,313
- Ready for what, Otto?
- Exhibition.

347
00:25:24,894 --> 00:25:27,131
- But...
- No but, but!

348
00:25:27,198 --> 00:25:31,421
Go home, have some rest,
have some good sleep.

349
00:25:31,966 --> 00:25:35,065
And tomorrow, bring your family here.

350
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:45,941
Why do we have to go
to see her stupid skating?

351
00:25:46,015 --> 00:25:47,444
But I don't want go.

352
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:49,405
We go to your hockey games...

353
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,314
you can go to her figure skating,
and that's final.

354
00:25:52,383 --> 00:25:53,332
Dad...

355
00:25:53,407 --> 00:25:55,796
You heard your mother.
Now, eat your supper.

356
00:25:57,311 --> 00:25:59,253
Pass the biscuits, please.

357
00:26:05,568 --> 00:26:10,008
<i>Can you imagine how Katie felt
as she stepped on to the ice?</i>

358
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,170
You are ready?

359
00:26:19,552 --> 00:26:20,534
Good.

360
00:26:20,608 --> 00:26:22,975
Katie, try to stay on your skates.

361
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,244
Yeah, and not on your bottom.

362
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:34,491
Silence, if you want to live another day.

363
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,825
Oh, Katie.

364
00:28:08,164 --> 00:28:09,690
Way to go, Katie.

365
00:28:23,332 --> 00:28:26,944
<i>But life can sometimes change
when you least expect it.</i>

366
00:28:29,573 --> 00:28:32,672
And Mr. Brewer says
that she really has potential.

367
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:35,041
In a few months, she might even...

368
00:28:35,237 --> 00:28:37,310
Ted, are you listening to me?

369
00:28:39,942 --> 00:28:41,600
What is it? What's wrong?

370
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,963
I got notice today at the mill.

371
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,717
I've been let go.

372
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:48,867
Oh, Ted.

373
00:28:50,342 --> 00:28:52,000
There's work in the city.

374
00:28:52,837 --> 00:28:54,048
You mean move?

375
00:28:54,822 --> 00:28:56,196
Sarah, you know as well as I do...

376
00:28:56,262 --> 00:28:58,880
that Grierson Lumber
is the only game in town.

377
00:28:59,078 --> 00:29:01,249
Moving to the city's our only option.

378
00:29:03,142 --> 00:29:06,590
Otto, I want to stay here with you.

379
00:29:07,014 --> 00:29:10,593
That's not possible, child.
Your family needs you.

380
00:29:12,838 --> 00:29:16,548
Katie, when you are on the ice...

381
00:29:16,615 --> 00:29:19,070
you will sometimes fall down...

382
00:29:19,303 --> 00:29:23,329
but you will always get up and try again.

383
00:29:23,687 --> 00:29:24,865
Yes?

384
00:29:25,735 --> 00:29:28,484
Keep getting up, Katie.

385
00:29:31,015 --> 00:29:32,324
Goodbye.

386
00:29:37,063 --> 00:29:38,307
Goodbye.

387
00:29:40,776 --> 00:29:42,881
- Stop!
- What's the matter?

388
00:29:43,431 --> 00:29:45,406
This is not cheering me up!

389
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:46,821
But I haven't got to the...

390
00:29:46,888 --> 00:29:48,230
Tell me more about Blizzard.

391
00:29:48,296 --> 00:29:50,467
You said this was about
their great friendship.

392
00:29:50,535 --> 00:29:52,226
I will, sweet pea, but first...

393
00:29:52,296 --> 00:29:55,645
No, please, Aunt Millie, now.

394
00:29:55,976 --> 00:29:58,213
Oh, mercy me, child, all right.

395
00:29:59,368 --> 00:30:01,125
Well, Blizzard grew...

396
00:30:02,184 --> 00:30:05,446
and one night she discovered she
possessed not one...

397
00:30:05,896 --> 00:30:09,245
but two of the three magic reindeer gifts.

398
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:11,491
What magic reindeer gifts?

399
00:30:14,952 --> 00:30:19,393
<i>Now, back then, it was very rare for
female reindeer to be accomplished flyers.</i>

400
00:30:19,465 --> 00:30:21,636
Except, of course, for Vixen.

401
00:30:22,089 --> 00:30:26,246
And it was well known that one of
Archimedes' most important rules...

402
00:30:27,081 --> 00:30:30,245
was never, ever, to fly at night...

403
00:30:30,313 --> 00:30:32,255
without an approved flight plan.

404
00:30:33,193 --> 00:30:37,285
But, as you know, Blizzard didn't care
much for rules, so she flew anyway...

405
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:40,801
simply because she loved to fly.

406
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:02,884
Blizzard, you were flying
after hours without a flight plan.

407
00:31:03,466 --> 00:31:08,006
This is in direct violation
of rule B10, section 1 43.

408
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:12,961
These rules are not to be broken
just because you feel like it.

409
00:31:13,098 --> 00:31:15,041
Who made up these rules, anyway?

410
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:16,389
Well, Blitzen.

411
00:31:16,715 --> 00:31:18,341
Blizzard, you're grounded.

412
00:31:18,411 --> 00:31:20,483
Grounded? You mean I can't...

413
00:31:21,163 --> 00:31:24,742
And you'll stay in this paddock
until I say otherwise.

414
00:31:25,355 --> 00:31:27,079
That's not fair!

415
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,913
If only she were
more like Cupid's daughter, Aphrodite.

416
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,125
This won't happen again, Archimedes.

417
00:31:33,484 --> 00:31:36,451
<i>Blizzard was unbelievably sad.</i>

418
00:31:37,196 --> 00:31:41,898
<i>But this was how she discovered
she had the second magic reindeer gift.</i>

419
00:31:42,508 --> 00:31:45,507
I can't believe
they'd lock me in my paddock.

420
00:31:46,188 --> 00:31:48,458
"Why can't you be more like Aphrodite?"

421
00:31:48,556 --> 00:31:50,826
I don't want to be more like Aphrodite.

422
00:31:52,588 --> 00:31:55,272
At times I just wish I could...

423
00:32:00,108 --> 00:32:01,450
Wow!

424
00:32:01,516 --> 00:32:04,037
Now I see me. Now I don't!

425
00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:08,456
Wow! This is great.

426
00:32:09,517 --> 00:32:12,234
Oh man, my hooves are on fire.

427
00:32:12,301 --> 00:32:14,211
I could really use a pedicure.

428
00:32:14,285 --> 00:32:17,830
Yeah, no kidding. I've got some
nasty chafing from today's practice.

429
00:32:17,901 --> 00:32:21,796
Yeah, my wife says I should soak in a
warm bath with a little bit of lavender.

430
00:32:21,869 --> 00:32:23,014
Lavender? Who knew?

431
00:32:23,085 --> 00:32:25,289
Yeah. It's supposed to relieve stress.

432
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,950
Did you hear something?

433
00:32:33,262 --> 00:32:34,506
Good evening, sir.

434
00:32:34,574 --> 00:32:36,941
Is it?

435
00:32:38,894 --> 00:32:41,643
- Been working here long, have you?
- Yes, sir.

436
00:32:42,222 --> 00:32:44,230
- You enjoy working?
- Very much...

437
00:32:44,302 --> 00:32:45,993
You take pride in your work,
that sort of thing?

438
00:32:46,063 --> 00:32:47,623
Yes, very much so, sir.

439
00:32:47,694 --> 00:32:50,629
As I suspected.

440
00:32:52,046 --> 00:32:54,730
Code P1359, section 1 1...

441
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,094
subsection V1 2, clause 7-4.

442
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,812
It's not wide enough.

443
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:02,697
You understand?
There's more work to be done, is the point.

444
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:04,196
Stupid.

445
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:11,087
- Who did that?
- I didn't see anyone.

446
00:33:11,151 --> 00:33:12,580
- You didn't see anyone?
- Sir, did you trip?

447
00:33:12,655 --> 00:33:14,313
Did I trip? I was pushed!

448
00:33:14,895 --> 00:33:17,797
Did I trip! Whoever did that...

449
00:33:18,352 --> 00:33:21,069
- Did you see anyone?
- I didn't see anyone, sir.

450
00:33:21,135 --> 00:33:22,215
No one?

451
00:33:22,288 --> 00:33:24,459
For that, you're on report. Back to work.

452
00:33:24,527 --> 00:33:25,705
I'm on...

453
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,588
Did you see his face?

454
00:33:33,007 --> 00:33:36,106
Blizzard, you were invisible.

455
00:33:36,241 --> 00:33:40,169
Oh, Jeremy, you can see me?
I'll have to remember that.

456
00:33:40,464 --> 00:33:44,109
Listen, this will just have to stay
our little secret, okay?

457
00:33:44,752 --> 00:33:48,647
But, as long as you know that secret,
can I tell you another one?

458
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:52,492
I know it's against the rules,
but I'm going to go night flying.

459
00:33:52,561 --> 00:33:53,870
You want to come?

460
00:33:54,001 --> 00:33:56,422
Why not, I'm on report anyway.

461
00:33:57,649 --> 00:33:59,656
- How much do you weigh?
- I don't know, why?

462
00:33:59,729 --> 00:34:03,374
Well, you'll be my first passenger,
and I've never flown with baggage before.

463
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:05,197
Baggage? Thanks.

464
00:34:05,329 --> 00:34:08,297
You're not going to crash, are you?
I can't look.

465
00:34:09,265 --> 00:34:11,305
Just hold on, baggage.

466
00:34:11,858 --> 00:34:14,989
<i>"Crash" and "Baggage"
became great friends.</i>

467
00:34:15,057 --> 00:34:19,083
<i>And they were together the day
Blizzard learned that she had the third...</i>

468
00:34:19,153 --> 00:34:22,350
<i>and the most amazing
of the magic reindeer gifts.</i>

469
00:34:23,346 --> 00:34:25,833
And so, the end.

470
00:34:26,642 --> 00:34:30,025
Oh, wait a minute, Aunt Millie, what about
the third magic gift?

471
00:34:30,098 --> 00:34:31,527
Do you want something more to eat?

472
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:34,472
And Katie hasn't even met Blizzard,
or become best friends...

473
00:34:34,547 --> 00:34:36,434
or anything. No, wait!

474
00:34:37,138 --> 00:34:38,632
It can't be the end yet!

475
00:34:38,706 --> 00:34:41,008
But that's as far as you'll let me tell.

476
00:34:41,107 --> 00:34:42,121
No, it isn't!

477
00:34:42,194 --> 00:34:46,089
So you do want to know what happened
after Katie and Otto said goodbye?

478
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:49,576
Can't you just tell me
about the third magic gift?

479
00:34:49,651 --> 00:34:50,764
Nope.

480
00:34:51,315 --> 00:34:53,454
Because what happened to Katie...

481
00:34:53,587 --> 00:34:57,516
is how Blizzard discovered she had
the most magical reindeer gift of all.

482
00:34:59,923 --> 00:35:03,338
Okay, but why does it have to be so sad?

483
00:35:04,723 --> 00:35:07,178
Every story has sad parts.

484
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:11,181
You've just got to get through them
to get to the good bits.

485
00:35:13,844 --> 00:35:16,364
Oh, don't be afraid of your feelings, Jess.

486
00:35:17,012 --> 00:35:19,117
They let you know you're alive.

487
00:35:22,004 --> 00:35:24,175
Okay. So...

488
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,535
where were we?

489
00:35:27,764 --> 00:35:30,797
Well, Katie's dad lost his job
at the lumber mill...

490
00:35:30,868 --> 00:35:32,778
and Katie had to say goodbye to Otto.

491
00:35:32,853 --> 00:35:34,314
Yeah.

492
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:38,571
Can you imagine how Katie felt
when she had to say goodbye...

493
00:35:38,645 --> 00:35:41,230
to everything that was near and dear to her?

494
00:35:46,837 --> 00:35:49,936
<i>And things got pretty grim
for the whole family.</i>

495
00:35:57,845 --> 00:36:00,977
There, honey,
that should give you some privacy.

496
00:36:01,717 --> 00:36:03,244
- I called it first.
- You did not!

497
00:36:03,318 --> 00:36:05,041
- Did too!
- Did not!

498
00:36:06,325 --> 00:36:08,846
Enough. Joe, top. Jack, bottom.

499
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:10,227
I win. You lose.

500
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:11,821
But, Dad, that's not fair!

501
00:36:11,894 --> 00:36:12,842
Sucker.

502
00:36:12,918 --> 00:36:14,828
How come he always gets what he wants?

503
00:36:14,901 --> 00:36:17,323
No arguments. And don't pester your sister.

504
00:36:18,454 --> 00:36:20,821
It won't be for long, I promise.

505
00:36:26,422 --> 00:36:27,666
Stop it.

506
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:57,101
Last one's a dirty rotten egg.

507
00:36:57,176 --> 00:36:58,223
Come on, get him!

508
00:37:06,264 --> 00:37:07,725
She must be a new girl.

509
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,069
Yeah, I haven't seen her before, either.

510
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,866
Why, thank you, Jeffrey.

511
00:37:32,377 --> 00:37:34,930
Looks good. Now, shoulders back.

512
00:37:35,257 --> 00:37:37,264
Arms wide. Nice.

513
00:37:37,913 --> 00:37:40,052
Arch your back, knees bent.

514
00:37:41,017 --> 00:37:42,872
Now watch your speed going in.

515
00:37:45,913 --> 00:37:48,783
That girl was spying, she distracted me.

516
00:37:50,073 --> 00:37:52,561
No, Erin, it was your sloppy takeoff.

517
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:55,700
Well, she shouldn't be here spying.

518
00:37:55,769 --> 00:37:58,901
All right, now do it again,
and this time, concentrate.

519
00:38:05,978 --> 00:38:08,661
All right, the air tag master is here.

520
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,618
You guys ready?
Who wants to have some fun now?

521
00:38:10,682 --> 00:38:12,919
- This is power tag.
- Want some of this?

522
00:38:12,986 --> 00:38:14,131
- Who's it first?
- You're it.

523
00:38:14,202 --> 00:38:17,071
- All right. All right, let's go.
- Okay, let's go. Go for it. Come on.

524
00:38:17,146 --> 00:38:18,161
That doesn't count.

525
00:38:18,235 --> 00:38:19,544
What're you talking about? I tagged you.

526
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,683
- Man, I got you.
- He got you. He totally got you.

527
00:38:21,755 --> 00:38:23,642
You gonna cry or are you gonna fly?

528
00:38:23,706 --> 00:38:24,851
Tag! Tag!

529
00:38:25,435 --> 00:38:28,599
You're it! Now I'm going to give you boys
a fighting chance.

530
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:30,457
Come on.

531
00:38:31,611 --> 00:38:34,906
- Come on, let's get her.
- Yeah, let's go!

532
00:38:35,003 --> 00:38:36,596
Wow, isn't Blizzard great?

533
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:38,839
Great? You're nuts. She's a freak.

534
00:38:38,907 --> 00:38:40,565
- Freak?
- Yeah, freak.

535
00:38:40,635 --> 00:38:42,097
Freak this!

536
00:38:42,684 --> 00:38:46,033
What's the matter, boys?
You got a little lead in your hooves?

537
00:38:47,163 --> 00:38:48,211
Look out!

538
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,455
Having a little trouble there? Sorry.

539
00:38:51,035 --> 00:38:52,890
My antlers.

540
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:55,921
I don't see what's so great about her.

541
00:38:56,091 --> 00:38:58,263
So she can fly. Whoopie.

542
00:38:59,164 --> 00:39:00,179
Give it back!

543
00:39:00,252 --> 00:39:01,779
- Keep away!
- You're it.

544
00:39:02,012 --> 00:39:03,441
My, but you're slow.

545
00:39:04,988 --> 00:39:07,377
Hey, are you guys still back there?

546
00:39:08,605 --> 00:39:10,710
What's the matter, all tuckered out?

547
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:14,578
What are you going to tell your friends?
You got beat by a girl?

548
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,376
- Give it back!
- Come get it.

549
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:19,705
You'll have to do better if you want it back.

550
00:39:19,773 --> 00:39:20,918
Hi, Dad!

551
00:39:20,989 --> 00:39:22,516
- Got it!
- Not for long.

552
00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:24,476
What the devil's going on in here?

553
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:26,712
No!

554
00:39:30,365 --> 00:39:31,707
- Where'd she go?
- She went this way.

555
00:39:31,773 --> 00:39:33,082
I don't see her.

556
00:39:34,174 --> 00:39:36,213
Gotcha! You're it.

557
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:38,172
Wait a minute, did you hear that?

558
00:39:38,237 --> 00:39:39,863
Hear what? I didn't hear anything.

559
00:39:39,934 --> 00:39:41,821
No, listen.

560
00:39:45,213 --> 00:39:46,588
What's the matter?

561
00:39:47,006 --> 00:39:48,533
I'm not sure.

562
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,052
Let's go find Jeremy.

563
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,299
You heard a voice?

564
00:39:54,462 --> 00:39:58,488
But I didn't just hear it,
I mean, I saw a little girl.

565
00:39:58,878 --> 00:40:02,490
And suddenly I felt this great sadness.

566
00:40:02,686 --> 00:40:04,475
- Oh, no!
- What?

567
00:40:04,606 --> 00:40:07,388
- You had a vision of a human child?
- Yeah.

568
00:40:07,486 --> 00:40:09,526
- Blizzard, you've got it.
- Got what?

569
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,211
The third magical reindeer gift!
The gift of empathic navigation.

570
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:14,521
Empathic navigation?

571
00:40:14,591 --> 00:40:17,722
It's how Santa finds the true hearts
of good children at Christmas.

572
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,219
It's the greatest of the gifts...

573
00:40:19,295 --> 00:40:21,434
but only the Donner lineage
is supposed to have it.

574
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:22,779
Then how come I don't have it?

575
00:40:22,847 --> 00:40:24,701
Don't worry, D.J., I'm sure you will.

576
00:40:24,767 --> 00:40:28,564
This is unbelievable.
You have all three magic gifts.

577
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:30,876
- Blizzard, do you know what this means?
- No. What?

578
00:40:30,943 --> 00:40:35,286
No other reindeer in the history of
Santa's reindeer has ever had all three gifts.

579
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,789
- What do I do?
- Nothing.

580
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,871
- Nothing?
- Do absolutely nothing.

581
00:40:38,944 --> 00:40:41,049
This could only get you
into really serious trouble.

582
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,909
Jeremy, she was so sad.

583
00:40:42,976 --> 00:40:45,561
Crash, please listen to me for once...

584
00:40:45,631 --> 00:40:46,941
ignore her.

585
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,386
One of Archimedes' most important rules
is that you can't contact humans.

586
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,758
Only Santa can do that,
and only on Christmas.

587
00:40:53,824 --> 00:40:55,417
- There she is. Blizzard!
- Oh, boy.

588
00:40:55,488 --> 00:40:56,633
Uh-oh, it's your dad.

589
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,454
Blizzard, this time, young lady,
you've gone too far.

590
00:40:59,521 --> 00:41:01,430
What am I going to do with you?

591
00:41:01,985 --> 00:41:03,578
Thanks for your help, Aphrodite.

592
00:41:03,649 --> 00:41:05,274
Glad I could help.

593
00:41:05,537 --> 00:41:06,999
Blizzard, come with me!

594
00:41:07,073 --> 00:41:08,382
See you, Jeremy.

595
00:41:08,576 --> 00:41:10,399
Remember what I said.

596
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,208
The rest of you get on home, too.

597
00:41:31,329 --> 00:41:33,402
<i>Blizzard was terribly torn...</i>

598
00:41:33,793 --> 00:41:36,412
<i>for she felt the sadness
as if it were her own...</i>

599
00:41:36,898 --> 00:41:39,713
<i>and she saw the little girl so clearly...</i>

600
00:41:41,058 --> 00:41:44,953
<i>but breaking one of Archimedes
three most important rules...</i>

601
00:41:45,154 --> 00:41:49,496
<i>would be completely,
absolutely unthinkable!</i>

602
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,254
Mommy! Mom!

603
00:42:17,731 --> 00:42:19,488
Mommy, there was a monster.

604
00:42:19,587 --> 00:42:22,402
What? No. Katie, it was a bad dream.

605
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:24,670
No, I saw it. It was staring at me.

606
00:42:24,739 --> 00:42:27,009
Ooga-booga-boo, a scary monster.

607
00:42:29,571 --> 00:42:31,644
All right, that's enough. Back to bed.

608
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:32,730
But it was there.

609
00:42:32,803 --> 00:42:35,487
I'm sure it was, but it's gone now.

610
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:41,886
Why don't you come and sleep in our room,
would that be better? Okay?

611
00:42:46,596 --> 00:42:47,905
Not another peep.

612
00:43:28,262 --> 00:43:29,374
Katie?

613
00:43:30,726 --> 00:43:32,319
I'm sorry I scared you.

614
00:43:32,422 --> 00:43:34,310
Please don't scream.

615
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:36,257
What are you?

616
00:43:36,454 --> 00:43:38,843
I'm a reindeer from the North Pole.

617
00:43:39,622 --> 00:43:41,084
My name is Blizzard.

618
00:43:41,446 --> 00:43:42,853
Santa's reindeer?

619
00:43:42,919 --> 00:43:45,853
Yeah, you've probably heard of
my dad. Blitzen.

620
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:49,986
Do all of Santa's reindeer look like you?

621
00:43:50,055 --> 00:43:53,186
No. I'm kind of special.

622
00:43:53,446 --> 00:43:55,934
I mean, I can fly faster than anybody.

623
00:43:56,007 --> 00:43:57,600
And I can become invisible.

624
00:43:57,671 --> 00:44:00,988
And I have empa... empa something.

625
00:44:01,191 --> 00:44:03,777
What it means is, I can see with my heart.

626
00:44:04,104 --> 00:44:06,046
And that's what brought me here.

627
00:44:06,695 --> 00:44:08,735
Katie, why are you so sad?

628
00:44:09,448 --> 00:44:12,262
Daddy lost his job, and we just moved here.

629
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,620
I miss my house, and I miss skating.

630
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,854
That's the thing I love most in the world.

631
00:44:18,919 --> 00:44:20,326
But I can't skate anymore.

632
00:44:20,392 --> 00:44:21,374
But why not?

633
00:44:21,448 --> 00:44:24,098
You just said that skating's the thing
you love most in the world.

634
00:44:24,167 --> 00:44:27,070
If you love skating, then you have to skate!

635
00:44:28,136 --> 00:44:30,111
What exactly is skating?

636
00:44:31,112 --> 00:44:33,982
See, you're laughing. I already helped.

637
00:44:35,656 --> 00:44:37,958
Okay, are you comfortable?

638
00:44:38,057 --> 00:44:41,319
Oh, watch the antlers,
you don't want to get poked in the eye.

639
00:44:41,768 --> 00:44:45,282
Now, I don't want to make you nervous,
but you're only my second passenger.

640
00:44:45,353 --> 00:44:47,141
- All right, you ready?
- Yeah.

641
00:44:47,208 --> 00:44:49,477
All right, Katie, hold on.

642
00:44:49,545 --> 00:44:51,650
Don't worry, I will.

643
00:44:51,881 --> 00:44:55,711
You know, I've discovered
it's a whole different world from up here.

644
00:44:55,785 --> 00:44:57,127
Oh, my.

645
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:02,657
Whoa, Blizzard.

646
00:45:44,683 --> 00:45:46,919
Hang on. Down we go.

647
00:45:49,803 --> 00:45:52,487
- How's this?
- Oh, Blizzard, it's perfect.

648
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,940
- I'll be right back.
- Katie, where are you going?

649
00:45:56,172 --> 00:45:58,376
- Katie?
- You'll see.

650
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,692
Leave me in the dark all by myself.

651
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,322
Oh, my.

652
00:46:12,428 --> 00:46:16,738
Oh, I see. Skating is just like flying on ice.

653
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,104
You know what?
I think I'll just stick to flying.

654
00:47:19,791 --> 00:47:22,027
<i>What fun they had.</i>

655
00:47:23,183 --> 00:47:26,663
- lf only...
- No, not again.

656
00:47:26,895 --> 00:47:28,869
What? Does something really bad
happen to Katie?

657
00:47:28,943 --> 00:47:31,398
No, just the opposite.

658
00:47:31,471 --> 00:47:34,089
It was a really good thing
that led to all the trouble.

659
00:47:50,352 --> 00:47:52,010
Hey, you.

660
00:47:52,432 --> 00:47:55,781
This is a private club, for members only.

661
00:47:56,143 --> 00:47:59,439
- I just wanted...
- You don't belong here. So beat it.

662
00:48:19,344 --> 00:48:23,022
I told you to stay away,
this place is for skaters.

663
00:48:24,305 --> 00:48:25,930
I can skate.

664
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,383
Did you guys hear that?
Snooper here says she can skate.

665
00:48:29,521 --> 00:48:31,431
Snooper.

666
00:48:34,321 --> 00:48:38,599
- I can, too, as well as any of you.
- Then I guess you'll just have to prove it.

667
00:48:38,705 --> 00:48:41,422
Erin's the reigning club and city champion.

668
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:44,839
Unless you're a chicken as well as a snoop.

669
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:47,952
Look, tomorrow, after our practice...

670
00:48:48,018 --> 00:48:51,880
show up at your snoop door,
and we'll see if you can really skate.

671
00:48:56,561 --> 00:48:58,983
How are things going at your new school?

672
00:49:00,818 --> 00:49:03,884
- Katie?
- Okay, I guess.

673
00:49:04,658 --> 00:49:07,440
Don't worry,
I'm sure you'll make some friends soon.

674
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:10,184
Here, hold this.

675
00:49:16,978 --> 00:49:19,345
Miss Brewer, what a surprise. Come in.

676
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:21,233
- Hello.
- Hello.

677
00:49:24,307 --> 00:49:27,568
Where's Otto? Isn't he coming?

678
00:49:29,395 --> 00:49:30,857
No, honey, he isn't.

679
00:49:32,627 --> 00:49:33,838
Katie...

680
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:37,773
my father hadn't been well for some time.

681
00:49:38,259 --> 00:49:39,983
He was a good man...

682
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:44,489
even though he could be
a little prickly at times.

683
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,882
More than anything,
my father loved skating...

684
00:49:48,948 --> 00:49:51,850
and in all of the years ever
since he was in the Olympics...

685
00:49:51,924 --> 00:49:54,794
not once did he take on a student, until you.

686
00:49:57,908 --> 00:49:59,915
He wanted you to have this.

687
00:50:12,404 --> 00:50:13,484
You know...

688
00:50:14,357 --> 00:50:18,132
he used to tell me that the two of you
were just alike...

689
00:50:18,197 --> 00:50:21,459
that you were both happiest
when you were on the ice.

690
00:50:31,157 --> 00:50:33,677
Maybe I shouldn't do this.

691
00:50:34,549 --> 00:50:37,484
Katie, you love skating...

692
00:50:37,846 --> 00:50:41,708
and you can't let anyone stop you
from doing it.

693
00:50:42,198 --> 00:50:46,224
- That's what Otto used to tell me.
- Otto was a smart man.

694
00:50:46,294 --> 00:50:49,109
And I have a feeling
that if he were here right now, he'd say:

695
00:50:49,174 --> 00:50:53,364
"Katie, get in there,
and skate circles around that little girl."

696
00:50:53,654 --> 00:50:56,621
You can do it. Come on, Katie.

697
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:58,674
I'll see you inside.

698
00:51:02,646 --> 00:51:05,167
Good work, girls. See you all tomorrow.

699
00:51:05,974 --> 00:51:06,923
Yes.

700
00:51:10,103 --> 00:51:12,973
Miss Ward,
is it okay to stay to work on my routine?

701
00:51:13,047 --> 00:51:15,567
With the city championships
coming up and all...

702
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:19,119
Good for you, Erin.
A little extra work never hurt anybody.

703
00:51:26,935 --> 00:51:28,364
Hey, Snooper.

704
00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:30,868
You ready?

705
00:51:31,768 --> 00:51:35,063
Are your skates yellow,
or are you actually a chicken?

706
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,257
What was that?

707
00:51:46,616 --> 00:51:47,565
Blizzard?

708
00:51:49,336 --> 00:51:50,285
Blizzard?

709
00:51:51,416 --> 00:51:52,365
I'm here.

710
00:51:53,368 --> 00:51:55,856
Don't do anything, please.

711
00:51:55,929 --> 00:51:58,068
I just want to skate fair.

712
00:51:58,457 --> 00:52:02,451
- Promise me.
- Okay, I promise you.

713
00:52:11,193 --> 00:52:15,350
Okay, chicken skates,
let's see what you've got.

714
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:20,596
- You first.
- Okay, see if you can do any of this.

715
00:52:56,315 --> 00:52:58,006
That was good.

716
00:53:41,148 --> 00:53:44,377
What's going on here?
Who are you, young lady?

717
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:47,196
Katie Andrews.

718
00:53:47,837 --> 00:53:49,746
We were just going to call you, Miss Ward.

719
00:53:49,821 --> 00:53:52,341
We caught her skating here
without permission.

720
00:53:52,412 --> 00:53:55,162
<i>- Liar.
- Blizzard, no.</i>

721
00:53:55,229 --> 00:53:58,393
All right, all of you, practice is over,
get changed and go home.

722
00:53:58,461 --> 00:53:59,476
Now!

723
00:54:02,045 --> 00:54:04,347
Katie Andrews, is it?

724
00:54:04,669 --> 00:54:08,347
- Yes, ma'am.
- Katie, you have some explaining to do.

725
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:11,577
Take off those skates and come to my office.

726
00:54:12,477 --> 00:54:14,582
Erin, go.
Your father will be here any second...

727
00:54:14,653 --> 00:54:17,109
and you know
how he hates to be kept waiting.

728
00:54:18,077 --> 00:54:20,249
<i>So, young lady, an explanation.</i>

729
00:54:21,309 --> 00:54:24,157
Where on earth
did you learn to skate so beautifully?

730
00:54:24,926 --> 00:54:27,031
At home, on a pond.

731
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:31,132
- But who taught you?
- My coach. Otto Brewer.

732
00:54:31,455 --> 00:54:34,716
- Otto Brewer was your coach?
- You know him?

733
00:54:35,262 --> 00:54:38,262
In his day, he was the best that ever was.

734
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:41,660
But he vowed never to coach, why you?

735
00:54:43,327 --> 00:54:44,505
I don't know.

736
00:54:46,207 --> 00:54:48,149
I guess because I love skating.

737
00:54:48,959 --> 00:54:50,388
Well, it shows.

738
00:54:51,743 --> 00:54:52,691
Katie...

739
00:54:53,087 --> 00:54:56,633
every year, just before Christmas,
there's a city-wide skating championship...

740
00:54:56,703 --> 00:54:59,769
and from what I just saw out there,
you have the talent to compete.

741
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,694
Every club's allowed to send two skaters...

742
00:55:01,759 --> 00:55:03,931
and in two weeks,
we have our club qualifying meet.

743
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,334
But I'm not a member...

744
00:55:07,424 --> 00:55:11,036
- and we can't afford to join.
- You let me worry about that.

745
00:55:11,104 --> 00:55:13,525
What do you say, Katie Andrews?

746
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,236
<i>Katie was on the ice again...</i>

747
00:55:18,303 --> 00:55:21,565
<i>practicing hard
in order to get ready for the competition.</i>

748
00:55:21,632 --> 00:55:23,225
<i>While at the North Pole...</i>

749
00:55:23,296 --> 00:55:26,592
<i>Santa's team was hard at work
perfecting moves of their own.</i>

750
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:30,069
Easy, team. Moonwalk.

751
00:55:30,977 --> 00:55:32,438
Whoa!

752
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,025
Not bad for the first one of the day.

753
00:55:36,096 --> 00:55:39,806
Christmas is only a few weeks away,
we need to be a lot sharper than this.

754
00:55:39,873 --> 00:55:41,597
- More bags here.
- Okay.

755
00:55:41,665 --> 00:55:43,639
- We need them.
- They're changing the mounts.

756
00:55:43,713 --> 00:55:45,142
All clear!

757
00:55:46,657 --> 00:55:49,526
All right, now, let's look alive. Look alive.

758
00:55:54,401 --> 00:55:56,190
Dasher, Dancer...

759
00:55:56,257 --> 00:55:59,519
on my mark, up, up, and away!

760
00:56:07,073 --> 00:56:08,568
- D. J?
- Yeah, Blizzard?

761
00:56:08,642 --> 00:56:12,603
I'll bet someday you'll...
You'll be as great a navigator as your dad.

762
00:56:12,674 --> 00:56:16,318
- Do you really think so?
- Yeah, I do.

763
00:56:16,386 --> 00:56:18,874
- D.J., you can do this.
- Blizzard, where'd you go?

764
00:56:18,946 --> 00:56:21,085
All you have to do is believe in yourself.

765
00:56:21,155 --> 00:56:24,416
You're right, I can do this.
I just have to believe in myself.

766
00:56:24,995 --> 00:56:28,061
Just believe in myself enough. I'm doing it.

767
00:56:28,227 --> 00:56:32,700
I'm doing it, I'm feeling it. I'm doing it.

768
00:56:33,059 --> 00:56:35,230
<i>- Blizzard?
- Over here.</i>

769
00:56:35,299 --> 00:56:37,121
Yeah, I knew that.

770
00:56:38,403 --> 00:56:43,040
You say Blizzard has
the gift of invisibility? Interesting.

771
00:56:43,107 --> 00:56:45,114
No wonder
I have not caught her flying lately.

772
00:56:45,187 --> 00:56:46,234
Exactly.

773
00:56:46,307 --> 00:56:49,820
Unlike Blizzard,
Aphrodite, you are a very good reindeer.

774
00:56:49,891 --> 00:56:52,575
- Stop.
- I want you to keep an eye on this Blizzard.

775
00:56:52,643 --> 00:56:55,065
You let me know
if she breaks any more rules.

776
00:56:55,139 --> 00:56:58,555
I believe one day
she will break one too many, and then...

777
00:56:58,628 --> 00:57:00,635
I will banish the freak.

778
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:03,970
Don't you think banishment
might be too good for her?

779
00:57:04,036 --> 00:57:07,135
- At the very least I make an example.
- That's what I'm thinking.

780
00:57:07,204 --> 00:57:09,059
Tell me what you have in mind.

781
00:57:16,229 --> 00:57:17,309
Blizzard!

782
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,976
There you are.

783
00:57:31,044 --> 00:57:33,532
- Hey, Baggage, what's the hurry?
- What's going on?

784
00:57:33,605 --> 00:57:36,922
Listen, I don't know how she found out,
but Aphrodite...

785
00:57:36,997 --> 00:57:39,997
told Archimedes
about your gift of invisibility.

786
00:57:40,069 --> 00:57:41,149
Blizzard, this is serious.

787
00:57:41,221 --> 00:57:43,393
I mean, he's looking for any reason
to get you banished.

788
00:57:43,462 --> 00:57:44,672
- Banished?
- From now on...

789
00:57:44,741 --> 00:57:47,938
- you're going have to mind your p's and q's.
- Baggage, you worry too much.

790
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:50,559
Crash, please. I know Archimedes.

791
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:52,735
You don't want to do anything
to provoke him.

792
00:57:52,806 --> 00:57:54,180
This close to Christmas...

793
00:57:54,245 --> 00:57:58,621
he'll let nothing, and I mean nothing,
stand in the way of the big day.

794
00:57:58,694 --> 00:58:02,469
He's right, Blizzard, this is no time
to be on Archimedes' bad side.

795
00:58:02,534 --> 00:58:05,730
Boy, this is trouble I don't need.

796
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:10,238
And most importantly is that
you're supposed to be having fun out there.

797
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:13,344
Can you remember that?
It's going to look absolutely magnificent.

798
00:58:13,414 --> 00:58:15,716
Now, before tomorrow...

799
00:58:15,782 --> 00:58:19,394
I just want to say how proud I am
of how hard all of you have worked.

800
00:58:19,943 --> 00:58:22,277
So, grab your skates,
get a good night's sleep...

801
00:58:22,343 --> 00:58:24,928
and see you all
bright and early for warm-ups.

802
00:58:25,766 --> 00:58:27,490
Thank you, Miss Ward.

803
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:34,491
Katie.

804
00:58:41,031 --> 00:58:42,460
Katie, wake up.

805
00:58:47,591 --> 00:58:50,209
- I have to talk to you.
- Okay.

806
00:58:50,279 --> 00:58:51,654
I'll be right up.

807
00:58:56,776 --> 00:59:00,606
Blizzard, you're too early.
I don't skate until tomorrow morning.

808
00:59:01,768 --> 00:59:04,518
I know, Katie, I know,
but I'm in big trouble at home.

809
00:59:04,584 --> 00:59:08,130
I mean, everybody's really mad at me,
and I probably shouldn't even be here now...

810
00:59:08,201 --> 00:59:11,463
but I just had to come.
I'm not going to be here tomorrow...

811
00:59:11,529 --> 00:59:14,845
- and I just wanted to wish you good luck.
- It's okay, Blizzard.

812
00:59:15,529 --> 00:59:19,457
Since you can't be here tomorrow
why don't I skate my program tonight...

813
00:59:19,753 --> 00:59:24,096
- just for you. I'll go change.
- Okay, but hurry.

814
00:59:32,873 --> 00:59:34,783
There's something wrong.

815
00:59:37,481 --> 00:59:40,067
Katie, are you all right?

816
00:59:40,138 --> 00:59:43,913
- My skates. They're ruined.
- What do you mean, ruined?

817
00:59:49,578 --> 00:59:51,072
Blizzard, why?

818
00:59:51,562 --> 00:59:53,863
Why would anybody ruin my skates?

819
00:59:54,666 --> 00:59:56,357
Now what am I going to do?

820
00:59:57,674 --> 01:00:01,602
Hop on, Katie. I think I have an idea.

821
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:12,743
Baggage, it's me.

822
01:00:13,931 --> 01:00:16,386
- I need a favor.
- Go on.

823
01:00:16,491 --> 01:00:20,168
Can my friend come in and warm up?
Because she's really cold.

824
01:00:24,652 --> 01:00:27,750
- This is my friend Katie Andrews.
- Hi.

825
01:00:29,996 --> 01:00:31,425
Are you crazy?

826
01:00:31,499 --> 01:00:35,362
Bringing a human up here breaks
Archimedes' second most important rule.

827
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,533
- We could both get in a lot of trouble.
- But I had to.

828
01:00:38,603 --> 01:00:41,473
- Why?
- Because she needs some skates.

829
01:00:41,548 --> 01:00:43,686
Are your antlers loose?

830
01:00:43,755 --> 01:00:45,032
Wait a minute.

831
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,489
You're not thinking
what I think you're thinking, are you?

832
01:00:47,564 --> 01:00:50,084
Look, I just need to borrow them for a day.
Who's gonna know?

833
01:00:50,156 --> 01:00:52,545
Are you forgetting
the number-one rule around here?

834
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:56,843
Stealing a toy meant for another child
will get you banished for sure.

835
01:00:56,908 --> 01:00:59,047
She's my friend, Jeremy.

836
01:00:59,597 --> 01:01:01,986
You know, I would do the same for you.

837
01:01:02,093 --> 01:01:05,573
You're going to get us both sent
to some polar-bear-infested iceberg.

838
01:01:05,644 --> 01:01:08,808
Look, just do me a favor,
keep her warm till I get back, okay?

839
01:01:08,877 --> 01:01:10,087
Thanks, Baggage.

840
01:01:10,157 --> 01:01:14,314
Sure, we've got nothing else to do
while you're out committing larceny.

841
01:01:14,605 --> 01:01:16,744
- I heard that.
- Good.

842
01:01:28,462 --> 01:01:30,404
<i>So how hard could this be?</i>

843
01:02:05,231 --> 01:02:07,053
Here we go.

844
01:02:07,759 --> 01:02:09,930
Are you a real elf?

845
01:02:10,031 --> 01:02:12,170
No, I'm a fake elf.

846
01:02:13,136 --> 01:02:17,609
- I'm sorry, I've never seen one before.
- You're not supposed to.

847
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:21,389
It's one of the rules here in the village.
No humans allowed.

848
01:02:22,736 --> 01:02:24,525
Now listen, Katie...

849
01:02:24,944 --> 01:02:26,635
you have to promise, for Blizzard's sake...

850
01:02:26,704 --> 01:02:31,014
to make sure that those skates get back here
as quickly as possible, or else...

851
01:02:31,344 --> 01:02:34,410
- Just get them back, okay?
- I promise.

852
01:02:45,072 --> 01:02:47,941
<i>- Here, these should fit.
- Thank you, Blizzard.</i>

853
01:02:50,417 --> 01:02:54,246
Baggage, can you lend Katie
something warm to wear?

854
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:55,498
Why not?

855
01:03:00,177 --> 01:03:03,723
- Katie, how you doing back there?
- Just great.

856
01:03:04,913 --> 01:03:07,466
Wait till Archimedes hears about this.

857
01:04:07,091 --> 01:04:08,171
Attagirl.

858
01:04:24,596 --> 01:04:27,214
Great work, Erin, that's the best
you've ever skated that routine.

859
01:04:27,284 --> 01:04:28,943
Thank you, Miss Ward.

860
01:04:30,165 --> 01:04:34,126
Has anyone seen Katie Andrews?
She's next. Have you seen Katie?

861
01:04:36,533 --> 01:04:38,420
I'm here.

862
01:04:39,957 --> 01:04:40,905
I'm here.

863
01:04:51,189 --> 01:04:53,295
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's all right.

864
01:04:53,365 --> 01:04:55,023
- Nice coat.
- Thanks.

865
01:04:55,093 --> 01:04:57,362
You better give me that. Great.

866
01:04:57,781 --> 01:04:59,243
- How do you feel?
- Good.

867
01:04:59,318 --> 01:05:00,266
Good.

868
01:05:00,597 --> 01:05:01,807
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Ready?</i>

869
01:05:01,877 --> 01:05:04,528
<i>- ... our final skater, Katie Andrews.
- Go, go, go.</i>

870
01:06:42,265 --> 01:06:43,345
Bravo!

871
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:13,716
And our two qualifiers
for this year's regional competition...

872
01:07:14,554 --> 01:07:16,725
Erin Scott-Pierce...

873
01:07:22,363 --> 01:07:24,086
and Katie Andrews.

874
01:07:30,683 --> 01:07:32,276
Way to go, Katie.

875
01:07:41,339 --> 01:07:45,016
- You were really good.
- Thanks.

876
01:07:52,316 --> 01:07:55,960
That was pathetic, Erin.
Do you hear me? Pathetic.

877
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:58,394
Daddy, I...

878
01:07:59,259 --> 01:08:00,569
I did my best.

879
01:08:00,636 --> 01:08:03,221
It's obvious to me that,
that wasn't very good.

880
01:08:03,388 --> 01:08:05,330
You're going to have to do a lot
better than that...

881
01:08:05,404 --> 01:08:06,779
if you want to win the city championship.

882
01:08:06,844 --> 01:08:09,811
And you do want to win the championship,
don't you, Erin?

883
01:08:09,884 --> 01:08:10,833
Yes.

884
01:08:10,908 --> 01:08:13,275
I can't hear you, Erin.
Do you want to be a champion?

885
01:08:14,397 --> 01:08:15,477
Yes, Daddy.

886
01:08:15,548 --> 01:08:18,069
Then skate like one,
and not like some pathetic loser.

887
01:08:20,829 --> 01:08:24,244
Hurry up and get dressed.
I will wait for you in the car.

888
01:08:29,277 --> 01:08:31,830
I think you're a really great skater.

889
01:08:42,942 --> 01:08:43,890
I...

890
01:08:44,733 --> 01:08:47,035
Katie, I'm sorry. I...

891
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:50,197
I ruined your skates.

892
01:08:51,805 --> 01:08:53,561
I'm really sorry.

893
01:08:55,134 --> 01:08:56,661
It's okay, Erin.

894
01:08:57,598 --> 01:08:58,940
They were old...

895
01:09:00,702 --> 01:09:02,676
and really yellow.

896
01:09:04,606 --> 01:09:05,653
Over here.

897
01:09:08,831 --> 01:09:11,449
<i>- Blizzard.
- You were great.</i>

898
01:09:11,518 --> 01:09:12,631
Thanks to you.

899
01:09:12,703 --> 01:09:14,907
I'll meet you on the roof
as soon as I get home.

900
01:09:14,975 --> 01:09:17,080
<i>- Okay, but then I really have to get back.
- Okay.</i>

901
01:09:17,151 --> 01:09:18,612
Good skate, Katie.

902
01:09:20,927 --> 01:09:24,375
- Congratulations, honey.
- That was real nice, sweetheart.

903
01:09:24,447 --> 01:09:27,829
- You were really great, Katie.
- Yeah, you were...

904
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:30,006
You were really good.

905
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:33,014
Honey, where did this jacket come from?

906
01:09:38,016 --> 01:09:39,226
Blizzard?

907
01:09:42,591 --> 01:09:46,301
- Blizzard, are you here?
- Katie, where are you?

908
01:09:47,743 --> 01:09:49,172
Up here, Mom.

909
01:09:50,496 --> 01:09:52,219
What are you doing up here?

910
01:09:52,864 --> 01:09:54,424
Just looking at the stars.

911
01:09:54,496 --> 01:09:57,115
Coach Ward is on the phone.
Erin is missing.

912
01:09:57,185 --> 01:09:59,770
Her father says he waited in the car,
but she didn't come out.

913
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,735
- They've looked everywhere. Any ideas?
- I haven't seen her since the rink.

914
01:10:04,513 --> 01:10:07,775
Well, come inside. It's freezing out here.

915
01:10:07,841 --> 01:10:09,150
Blizzard.

916
01:10:09,409 --> 01:10:10,358
Blizzard.

917
01:10:11,233 --> 01:10:12,280
<i>Over here.</i>

918
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:15,735
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

919
01:10:15,809 --> 01:10:18,460
Her dad was yelling at her
after the competition.

920
01:10:18,785 --> 01:10:20,508
She was really upset.

921
01:10:20,865 --> 01:10:24,161
She must have run away.
Could you find her?

922
01:10:25,217 --> 01:10:26,330
Sure.

923
01:10:45,314 --> 01:10:48,096
- She's in danger.
- We have to help her.

924
01:10:48,514 --> 01:10:49,725
Let's go.

925
01:11:06,339 --> 01:11:07,287
Help!

926
01:11:10,563 --> 01:11:11,708
Help!

927
01:11:12,291 --> 01:11:15,160
Help me, somebody!

928
01:11:15,523 --> 01:11:18,043
Help me, please!

929
01:11:18,211 --> 01:11:19,160
Help!

930
01:11:27,268 --> 01:11:30,464
Help me, someone!

931
01:11:30,564 --> 01:11:32,474
Help!

932
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:35,355
Help me!

933
01:11:37,028 --> 01:11:40,127
Help me, somebody!

934
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:42,362
- Help!
- There she is.

935
01:11:42,532 --> 01:11:43,710
Help!

936
01:11:47,108 --> 01:11:50,240
Erin, don't be afraid.
We're going to get you out of here.

937
01:11:50,917 --> 01:11:55,107
- Give me your hand, we'll pull you out.
- No. If I let go, I'll slip in.

938
01:11:55,172 --> 01:11:57,539
Erin, please, just give me your hand.

939
01:11:57,604 --> 01:12:00,354
- Come on!
- That's it, Erin.

940
01:12:01,157 --> 01:12:02,498
Come on, hold on.

941
01:12:05,157 --> 01:12:06,684
Try again.

942
01:12:08,837 --> 01:12:11,390
Now, don't let go.

943
01:12:12,261 --> 01:12:15,458
- I'm slipping.
- Erin, hold on.

944
01:12:17,446 --> 01:12:20,707
- Katie, do you have her?
- Come on, Blizzard. Come on.

945
01:12:23,942 --> 01:12:27,389
- Hold on.
- Erin, we're almost there.

946
01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:36,288
Thanks, Katie.

947
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:39,803
Katie?

948
01:12:42,311 --> 01:12:44,864
It's okay, this is my best friend, Blizzard.

949
01:12:44,935 --> 01:12:47,204
Yeah, the one that's
in a whole lot of trouble.

950
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:49,180
She was the one that found you.

951
01:12:50,375 --> 01:12:54,172
Katie, help is on the way. I really have to go.

952
01:12:55,847 --> 01:12:58,236
So, I think you'll both be okay now.

953
01:13:00,135 --> 01:13:02,557
Thanks, Blizzard, for everything.

954
01:13:05,063 --> 01:13:06,656
Don't mention it.

955
01:13:07,399 --> 01:13:10,531
Hurry home, Blizzard.
I don't want you to get into trouble.

956
01:13:13,511 --> 01:13:17,308
I'll see you soon, Katie.
But not until after Christmas.

957
01:13:21,383 --> 01:13:26,140
I'll tell you all about it,
but you have to promise to keep it a secret.

958
01:13:29,352 --> 01:13:30,727
- Erin.
- Daddy?

959
01:13:30,792 --> 01:13:31,741
Erin.

960
01:13:34,984 --> 01:13:36,610
Are you all right?

961
01:13:36,681 --> 01:13:40,543
Goodness, you're freezing.
Come on, sweetheart, let's get you home.

962
01:13:47,241 --> 01:13:48,190
The skates!

963
01:13:49,961 --> 01:13:51,390
Blizzard, come back.

964
01:13:55,657 --> 01:13:57,762
- Blizzard!
- Katie.

965
01:13:57,833 --> 01:13:58,913
Blizzard!

966
01:13:58,985 --> 01:14:02,051
Haven't you been out
in the cold enough tonight?

967
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:05,608
There's someone on the phone for you,
something about skates.

968
01:14:07,754 --> 01:14:09,609
Blizzard is in trouble.

969
01:14:09,674 --> 01:14:12,805
I'm telling you, really big trouble.

970
01:14:12,873 --> 01:14:16,867
<i>Jeremy told Katie how Aphrodite
saw her at the North Pole...</i>

971
01:14:17,898 --> 01:14:21,640
<i>and how Blizzard
broke three of the most important rules:</i>

972
01:14:21,706 --> 01:14:25,634
<i>That no one but Santa
could contact a human.</i>

973
01:14:25,706 --> 01:14:29,667
<i>That no human could ever set foot
in Santa's Village.</i>

974
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:31,080
But wait, it's...

975
01:14:31,147 --> 01:14:33,732
<i>But the thing
that really cooked Blizzard's goose...</i>

976
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:37,512
<i>was that she broke
the number-one most important rule:</i>

977
01:14:38,346 --> 01:14:42,951
She took a finished Christmas toy
that belonged to another child.

978
01:14:44,555 --> 01:14:47,272
Archimedes has called
a Council of Elders tomorrow...

979
01:14:47,339 --> 01:14:51,300
and he's going to ask
Santa to banish her forever.

980
01:14:51,371 --> 01:14:54,535
<i>- No, he can't.
- Yes, he can, and he will.</i>

981
01:14:54,603 --> 01:14:57,058
What if you bring the skates back?
You could come get them.

982
01:14:57,131 --> 01:14:58,079
No.

983
01:14:58,763 --> 01:15:02,309
That is exactly what got Blizzard
into this mess in the first place.

984
01:15:02,412 --> 01:15:03,972
It's her only chance.

985
01:15:04,684 --> 01:15:06,920
Jeremy, she's your friend, too.

986
01:15:09,324 --> 01:15:12,706
Look, I'm telling you,
this is all one big misunderstanding.

987
01:15:14,124 --> 01:15:16,196
I can explain everything. See...

988
01:15:16,268 --> 01:15:18,789
Come on, Blizzard,
don't make this harder than it already is.

989
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:21,380
And what's the point
if you won't even listen?

990
01:15:26,028 --> 01:15:27,719
Let us know if you get hungry.

991
01:15:30,828 --> 01:15:33,894
Listen, there's no way I can get there
by myself.

992
01:15:34,253 --> 01:15:36,228
I need you to take me.

993
01:15:36,301 --> 01:15:40,195
I'd do anything for Blizzard, you know that,
but I'm not sure I can find my way.

994
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:43,586
You just worry about the flying,
I'll take care of the navigating.

995
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:45,286
All right, I'm in.

996
01:15:55,245 --> 01:15:58,987
Jeremy, I can't see a thing. Where are we?

997
01:15:59,758 --> 01:16:02,856
Hang on a second, I'll check.

998
01:16:06,766 --> 01:16:09,700
I think it's somewhere down there!

999
01:16:10,126 --> 01:16:12,395
That's a big help.

1000
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:23,459
Katie!

1001
01:16:24,527 --> 01:16:27,276
Katie, where are you?

1002
01:16:28,142 --> 01:16:32,550
Here. I'm here! Jeremy!

1003
01:16:44,592 --> 01:16:47,439
Katie, this is Donner Jr.
Donner Jr., this is Katie.

1004
01:16:47,503 --> 01:16:49,642
Okay, give me the skates,
and we are out of here.

1005
01:16:49,711 --> 01:16:50,988
I have to go, too.

1006
01:16:51,056 --> 01:16:53,871
I got Blizzard into this mess.
I have to tell Santa.

1007
01:16:53,967 --> 01:16:56,717
- I can't carry both of you.
- Please, Jeremy.

1008
01:16:56,783 --> 01:17:00,100
This was all my fault. I owe it to her.

1009
01:17:00,176 --> 01:17:03,492
- Why don't I take Katie, and you stay here?
- Are you certain?

1010
01:17:03,568 --> 01:17:07,758
- 'Cause this is no time to fool around.
- I can do it. I can find my way.

1011
01:17:08,816 --> 01:17:11,402
I must have frozen my brain.

1012
01:17:11,952 --> 01:17:14,734
Go. Just hurry back, okay?

1013
01:17:15,472 --> 01:17:16,879
Thanks, Jeremy.

1014
01:17:16,944 --> 01:17:19,049
We'll be back before
you have time to miss us.

1015
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,429
Yeah, I'll believe that when I see it.

1016
01:17:21,648 --> 01:17:24,944
Just hurry. I'm only wearing
one pair of long underwear.

1017
01:17:26,384 --> 01:17:28,173
Thanks again, Jeremy.

1018
01:17:29,201 --> 01:17:32,550
Oh, and remember, Donner Jr.,
you're heading north.

1019
01:17:32,625 --> 01:17:33,672
North!

1020
01:17:37,937 --> 01:17:41,832
Crash, if you can hear me,
I hope you're happy now.

1021
01:17:44,306 --> 01:17:45,767
Believe me, sir,
if we do not nip this in the bud right now...

1022
01:17:45,841 --> 01:17:49,190
it will end our way of life,
and possibly the Christmas mission.

1023
01:17:51,538 --> 01:17:52,880
Yes, well...

1024
01:17:55,890 --> 01:17:57,483
you may be right.

1025
01:17:58,418 --> 01:18:00,174
But I don't have to like it.

1026
01:18:06,002 --> 01:18:08,423
I hereby call this hearing to order.

1027
01:18:09,746 --> 01:18:12,561
We have gathered to decide
the fate of Blizzard...

1028
01:18:12,626 --> 01:18:15,048
daughter of Blitzen and Delphi.

1029
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:18,280
She stands accused...

1030
01:18:18,355 --> 01:18:22,130
of breaking all of our most sacred rules.

1031
01:18:23,059 --> 01:18:24,717
Bring forward the accused.

1032
01:18:27,027 --> 01:18:28,456
Quite frankly...

1033
01:18:28,979 --> 01:18:32,209
truth be told,
I have amassed a litany of lesser charges...

1034
01:18:32,275 --> 01:18:33,933
that she is guilty of.

1035
01:18:34,003 --> 01:18:38,160
However, in the interest of time,
I will skip to the chase.

1036
01:18:38,228 --> 01:18:41,544
The first of our sacred rules
that she has broken.

1037
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:46,257
She had unauthorized contact
with a human from the outside world.

1038
01:18:47,283 --> 01:18:50,764
Secondly, she brought this human...

1039
01:18:50,836 --> 01:18:53,683
into Santa's village.

1040
01:18:54,996 --> 01:18:56,523
Finally...

1041
01:18:56,596 --> 01:19:00,458
she stole a finished toy,
specifically, a pair of skates...

1042
01:19:00,532 --> 01:19:05,039
that was an assigned Christmas gift
for another child.

1043
01:19:06,773 --> 01:19:10,996
Never before has anyone broken
all three of our most sacred rules.

1044
01:19:11,061 --> 01:19:15,534
Therefore, I have no choice
but to recommend immediate banishment!

1045
01:19:15,861 --> 01:19:16,809
No!

1046
01:19:29,909 --> 01:19:32,463
- Blizzard?
- Yes, Santa.

1047
01:19:32,885 --> 01:19:36,301
- Is what Archimedes says true?
- It is, Santa.

1048
01:19:37,109 --> 01:19:40,525
But how did you find the child
in the first place?

1049
01:19:40,853 --> 01:19:43,952
I heard her cries, and I felt her sadness...

1050
01:19:44,790 --> 01:19:47,604
- and I saw her in my heart.
- Really?

1051
01:19:48,566 --> 01:19:50,355
Empathic navigation?

1052
01:19:50,422 --> 01:19:53,968
Why I've never heard of such a thing
outside of the Donner lineage.

1053
01:19:55,798 --> 01:19:57,489
Tell me, Blizzard...

1054
01:19:58,775 --> 01:20:02,998
how was it you were able to leave
and return without anyone seeing you?

1055
01:20:03,063 --> 01:20:05,484
I was invisible, Santa.

1056
01:20:06,679 --> 01:20:08,501
You were invisible?

1057
01:20:11,031 --> 01:20:13,649
And you can fly?

1058
01:20:15,639 --> 01:20:17,614
Why, then you have all three...

1059
01:20:18,711 --> 01:20:21,013
of the magic reindeer gifts.

1060
01:20:21,912 --> 01:20:24,246
Nothing was stolen!

1061
01:20:24,311 --> 01:20:25,969
Who are you?

1062
01:20:27,127 --> 01:20:29,844
Katie Andrews, Santa.

1063
01:20:29,911 --> 01:20:32,464
She is Blizzard's thieving partner.

1064
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:35,767
You, little girl, cannot be in here.

1065
01:20:35,832 --> 01:20:37,719
Santa, this is exactly
what I was talking about.

1066
01:20:37,784 --> 01:20:39,726
Archimedes, for the love of Christmas,
pipe down.

1067
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:42,899
Pipe down and sit down!
Let me hear what this child has to say.

1068
01:20:42,968 --> 01:20:45,783
Great balls of tinsel,
you can be annoying sometimes.

1069
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:50,989
Come over here, Katie Andrews.

1070
01:21:11,993 --> 01:21:14,033
These are the skates.

1071
01:21:14,105 --> 01:21:17,902
- So now they aren't stolen.
- I'm glad you brought these back.

1072
01:21:18,489 --> 01:21:21,588
And I can see that it was a very difficult
and very brave thing to do.

1073
01:21:21,657 --> 01:21:24,854
But that doesn't take away from
how serious this is for us.

1074
01:21:25,337 --> 01:21:28,207
Every society has its necessary rules.

1075
01:21:28,633 --> 01:21:32,856
And you just can't go around breaking them
because you feel like it, now, can you?

1076
01:21:34,746 --> 01:21:35,694
Now...

1077
01:21:37,338 --> 01:21:41,593
so would you please mind telling me
why I shouldn't punish...

1078
01:21:41,658 --> 01:21:46,066
Blizzard for breaking
all of our most important rules?

1079
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:49,618
Because...

1080
01:21:51,322 --> 01:21:53,908
Because she's
the most special reindeer ever...

1081
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:58,224
and she didn't use her gifts
just to break the rules...

1082
01:21:58,299 --> 01:22:00,633
because she felt like it.

1083
01:22:00,699 --> 01:22:02,707
She only wanted to help me.

1084
01:22:03,643 --> 01:22:07,188
She risked everything to come to me
when I needed her the most...

1085
01:22:08,123 --> 01:22:09,530
and, Santa...

1086
01:22:10,331 --> 01:22:12,666
Blizzard helped change everything.

1087
01:22:13,211 --> 01:22:16,343
She showed me
that I didn't have to be alone anymore...

1088
01:22:16,412 --> 01:22:19,925
to try anything, even flying.

1089
01:22:20,604 --> 01:22:24,052
She made me believe in me,
so I was able to skate again...

1090
01:22:24,444 --> 01:22:26,811
the thing I wanted most in the world.

1091
01:22:27,164 --> 01:22:30,742
And together we rescued Erin
from drowning in the pond.

1092
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:35,483
But never once did Blizzard
ask for anything in return...

1093
01:22:37,212 --> 01:22:39,001
but only to be my friend.

1094
01:22:45,788 --> 01:22:49,204
And she is the best friend I'll ever have.

1095
01:22:50,461 --> 01:22:51,955
Santa, please.

1096
01:22:52,637 --> 01:22:54,971
Give Blizzard another chance.

1097
01:22:56,733 --> 01:22:58,140
Please, Santa?

1098
01:22:59,357 --> 01:23:00,786
It's Christmas.

1099
01:23:10,045 --> 01:23:12,598
It certainly can be said...

1100
01:23:12,669 --> 01:23:16,117
that there is no higher expression
of the Christmas spirit...

1101
01:23:16,190 --> 01:23:18,972
than the giving of oneself...

1102
01:23:19,229 --> 01:23:22,132
with no thought of return
or of personal consequences.

1103
01:23:22,878 --> 01:23:27,068
These are the very ideals upon which
our community was founded.

1104
01:23:35,262 --> 01:23:37,117
All right, Katie Andrews...

1105
01:23:37,599 --> 01:23:40,086
I'll grant you your Christmas wish...

1106
01:23:40,831 --> 01:23:42,838
and give Blizzard another chance.

1107
01:23:53,375 --> 01:23:54,553
But, Santa...

1108
01:23:54,943 --> 01:23:57,213
- the rules.
- Good point, Archimedes.

1109
01:23:57,279 --> 01:23:59,864
The rules. I think there are too darn many.

1110
01:24:01,183 --> 01:24:02,809
One final thought.

1111
01:24:05,152 --> 01:24:08,501
Though Archimedes
may get a trifle carried away...

1112
01:24:08,992 --> 01:24:12,636
now and then,
there are rules which need to be followed.

1113
01:24:12,704 --> 01:24:16,086
- You understand that, don't you, Katie?
- Yes, Santa.

1114
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:19,645
- And do you understand that, little one?
- Yes, Santa.

1115
01:24:19,807 --> 01:24:20,756
Good.

1116
01:24:22,368 --> 01:24:24,987
Then after Blizzard flies you home...

1117
01:24:25,248 --> 01:24:27,550
she will return here immediately...

1118
01:24:28,256 --> 01:24:30,198
to live up to our faith in her...

1119
01:24:30,272 --> 01:24:33,207
and abide by all those rules
which bind us together...

1120
01:24:33,281 --> 01:24:35,168
and serve as our mission in life.

1121
01:24:35,232 --> 01:24:38,844
Which means that
you won't be able to see each other...

1122
01:24:39,681 --> 01:24:41,142
anymore.

1123
01:24:43,137 --> 01:24:45,504
I can see you have found true friendship.

1124
01:24:46,657 --> 01:24:48,762
That's a precious gift...

1125
01:24:49,921 --> 01:24:53,303
but trust me, this is for the best.

1126
01:24:54,337 --> 01:24:55,995
You must trust me.

1127
01:24:58,625 --> 01:25:00,349
Can you both...

1128
01:25:02,946 --> 01:25:04,222
do that?

1129
01:25:27,362 --> 01:25:30,745
- I love you, Blizzard.
- I love you, too, Katie.

1130
01:25:31,106 --> 01:25:32,667
And you know what?

1131
01:25:32,739 --> 01:25:35,673
This won't be as bad
as they tried to make it sound.

1132
01:25:35,747 --> 01:25:37,820
Because all I have to do is...

1133
01:25:37,891 --> 01:25:40,891
close my eyes and look inside,
and there you'll be.

1134
01:25:40,963 --> 01:25:43,450
So, whenever you just wondered
how I was doing, you know...

1135
01:25:43,523 --> 01:25:48,095
you could just close your eyes
and think about me sometimes.

1136
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:51,482
Can we go, please?

1137
01:25:52,676 --> 01:25:54,531
I hate saying goodbye.

1138
01:25:57,891 --> 01:25:59,386
Goodbye, Katie.

1139
01:26:00,611 --> 01:26:01,560
Bye.

1140
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:04,896
Bye, Katie.

1141
01:26:06,532 --> 01:26:08,572
Baggage, are you crying back there?

1142
01:26:08,996 --> 01:26:12,510
What? I am not crying. Just fly.

1143
01:26:13,028 --> 01:26:14,654
Merry Christmas, Katie.

1144
01:26:15,813 --> 01:26:19,904
<i>And that was the last time
Katie saw Blizzard...</i>

1145
01:26:24,037 --> 01:26:27,353
<i>flying Jeremy through the aurora borealis.</i>

1146
01:26:30,149 --> 01:26:31,556
No, Aunt Millie.

1147
01:26:33,061 --> 01:26:36,738
She had to see Blizzard again,
after everything they went through.

1148
01:26:38,565 --> 01:26:41,085
But you said their friendship lasted forever.

1149
01:26:42,565 --> 01:26:44,475
This has been a terrible story.

1150
01:26:44,773 --> 01:26:48,089
I feel worse than before.
Why did you tell me this?

1151
01:26:48,165 --> 01:26:51,199
So, Jessie, I haven't told you everything.

1152
01:26:51,590 --> 01:26:54,273
There's still the three Christmas gifts.

1153
01:26:55,014 --> 01:26:56,508
What gifts?

1154
01:27:00,966 --> 01:27:04,741
<i>Santa came that Christmas
and left Katie another present.</i>

1155
01:27:06,599 --> 01:27:09,828
<i>And the second gift
was even more valuable.</i>

1156
01:27:13,063 --> 01:27:16,740
<i>Katie and Erin became lifelong friends.</i>

1157
01:27:23,143 --> 01:27:25,052
<i>Santa was right.</i>

1158
01:27:25,799 --> 01:27:29,095
True friendship
is a very special gift indeed...

1159
01:27:30,055 --> 01:27:34,179
and you never know
where that gift is going to come from next.

1160
01:27:37,191 --> 01:27:40,257
How is this supposed to help me
not miss Bobby?

1161
01:27:40,327 --> 01:27:42,367
Because the third gift...

1162
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:45,254
was the greatest gift of all.

1163
01:27:47,431 --> 01:27:50,181
<i>Whenever Katie wanted to be with Blizzard...</i>

1164
01:27:50,504 --> 01:27:53,887
<i>all she had to do was close her eyes...</i>

1165
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:55,902
<i>and look inside.</i>

1166
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:14,407
Blizzard helped Katie to understand...

1167
01:28:14,472 --> 01:28:17,287
that just because a friend goes away...

1168
01:28:17,896 --> 01:28:19,838
a friendship doesn't.

1169
01:28:20,328 --> 01:28:22,151
It lives forever...

1170
01:28:24,713 --> 01:28:25,662
here.

1171
01:28:27,721 --> 01:28:30,339
Thank you, Aunt Millie.

1172
01:28:30,409 --> 01:28:33,192
You're welcome, sweetie peetie.

1173
01:28:34,858 --> 01:28:36,516
It was my pleasure.

1174
01:28:48,042 --> 01:28:52,232
Well, let's all go downstairs
and celebrate the season.

1175
01:28:53,034 --> 01:28:55,784
Plain Bob, did you bring my things in
from outside?

1176
01:28:56,298 --> 01:28:59,680
- Yes, Aunt Millie.
- You're stronger than you look.

1177
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:07,430
Jess, there are more presents
in the drawer of the big trunk over there.

1178
01:29:10,506 --> 01:29:13,802
- This one's for you, from my mother.
- Lovely.

1179
01:29:13,867 --> 01:29:16,453
Don't worry,
it's gonna be nothing like last year.

1180
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:43,047
Thank you, Aunt Millie.

1181
01:29:43,116 --> 01:29:47,753
- Merry Christmas, Jessie.
- Merry Christmas, Aunt Millie.

1182
01:29:52,972 --> 01:29:55,722
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Cameron.
- Merry Christmas, Derek.

1183
01:29:55,788 --> 01:29:57,577
- A new sled, huh?
- Yeah.

1184
01:29:57,644 --> 01:30:00,611
- It's nice.
- Hey, Jess, wanna take it for a spin?

1185
01:30:03,117 --> 01:30:05,386
Come on in, Derek.

1186
01:30:11,949 --> 01:30:13,705
- Cool sled, Derek.
- Thanks.

1187
01:30:13,773 --> 01:30:17,799
- You're not afraid to go fast, are you?
- No, the faster, the better.

1188
01:30:25,774 --> 01:30:28,621
Merry Christmas, Blizzard.

1189
01:30:32,046 --> 01:30:34,283
Come on, everybody, keep up.

1190
01:30:34,606 --> 01:30:35,554
Yeah!

1191
01:30:38,158 --> 01:30:40,842
Merry Christmas, Mildred Katie Andrews.

1192
01:30:43,054 --> 01:30:44,003
D. J...

1193
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:47,620
- D.J., we're going this way.
- Yes, dear, I knew that.
