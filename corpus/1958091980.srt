1
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:15,897
That's good whiskey
you're wasting.

2
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:19,801
Been away a few days, Tom.

3
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:23,236
How'd you find me, Ranger?

4
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,840
Hound got your scent
back at the ranch.

5
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,509
Shit, I smelled you
from miles away.

6
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:31,512
Who am I supposed
to have pissed off anyhow?

7
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:35,348
Hey, you done violated
the conditions of your parole.

8
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,751
Like hell I did.

9
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:42,422
Assault, brandishing
a firearm in a public place.

10
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:47,795
You stole a horse, rifle,
whiskey from your employer.

11
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:49,429
You want me to go on?

12
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:50,497
That's my rifle.

13
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:52,432
What business do you have

14
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:55,435
with a 10,000-dollar
plains rifle, Tom?

15
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,906
Oh, saddle up son.
You're done.

16
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:02,810
Try to run, I'll kill ya.

17
00:04:02,844 --> 00:04:05,780
Hunting to feed
my family, Ranger.

18
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,849
Too bad it ain't
hunting season.

19
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:11,586
And you're just
more trash

20
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,888
from Terlingua County
like me, Tom.

21
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,423
Stop pretending
to be what you ain't.

22
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,559
<i>Tyree, you got your ears on,</i>
<i>buddy? Where you at, partner?</i>

23
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:19,927
About 15 miles south

24
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:22,997
of Manse Point
over Alkali Flats.

25
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,433
Just picked up Tom
that stole a horse and rifle

26
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,435
and beat Joe Hansons.

27
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,437
What can I do for you, Elmer?

28
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,741
<i>10-65, old Mutual Bank</i>
<i>over here in Mount Verde</i>

29
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:36,611
<i>got themselves held up</i>
<i>about a half hour ago.</i>

30
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:38,411
<i>Four heavily armed gunmen</i>

31
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,081
<i>driving one of them</i>
<i>off-road type rigs</i>

32
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,449
<i>came in raising</i>
<i>all manners of hell.</i>

33
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,820
<i>Got a 10-99 code on it.</i>
<i>Killed three officers.</i>

34
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:48,488
<i>Even put old Ben Copper's boy</i>
<i>in the ER,</i>

35
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:50,958
<i>so figured they'd be heading</i>
<i>your direction there, Alex.</i>

36
00:04:50,992 --> 00:04:52,392
<i>Watch your six, buddy.</i>

37
00:05:05,907 --> 00:05:08,341
<i>10-22, subjects are armed</i>
<i>with automatic weapons.</i>

38
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,111
<i>At present, no other units</i>
<i>are available to assist you.</i>

39
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:13,346
10-24, we got eyes
on that 10-80.

40
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,650
Avenue J, outside of El Paso.

41
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:16,851
We are currently in pursuit.

42
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:18,385
<i>10-22, to confirm,</i>

43
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,955
<i>four subjects carrying AK-47s.</i>

44
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,957
Left on Avenue 245.

45
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,094
Whoo, they're coming in hot.
Watch it, watch it.

46
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:29,396
Ooh, this sumbitch is flying.

47
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,965
Come on, man,
you gonna lose 'em.

48
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:49,784
<i>10-22,</i> <i>we have a chopper inbound.
</i> <i>ETA: 17 minutes.</i>

49
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:51,853
Let's go. Gas, gas, gas!
Let's go!

50
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,703
10-24, we lost 'em.

51
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:10,538
They're heading
southbound on Terlingua.

52
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:12,506
Shit.

53
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,087
<i>10-22 has broken pursuit.</i>

54
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,057
<i>Suspects were last seen headed</i>
<i>southbound on Terlingua Street.</i>

55
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:35,830
One suspect has left
the vehicle.

56
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:37,098
We are going to engage.

57
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:39,567
"And there before me
was a white horse.

58
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,669
Its rider was named Death

59
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:43,070
and Hell...

60
00:06:43,104 --> 00:06:44,872
- ...so close behind Devil."
- Shit! Gun! Get out now!

61
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:54,682
<i>10-22,</i>
<i>this is 10-24. Come in.</i>

62
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,183
<i>Are you engaging the suspects?</i>

63
00:06:57,251 --> 00:07:00,420
<i>Shane, if you're there,</i>
<i>answer me.</i>

64
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:15,236
They'll make the border
before the state police
have a chopper off the ground.

65
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:16,971
Yeah, wish I was with them.

66
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,840
Creaky bastard like you

67
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:21,943
creeping up
on a full-blood Tonkawa.

68
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,845
Spot me.

69
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,215
<i>Mexican police</i>
<i>ain't got a unit close enough</i>
<i>to intercede.</i>

70
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:29,650
<i>These boys should be considered</i>

71
00:07:29,684 --> 00:07:31,786
<i>extremely dangerous</i>
<i>there, partner.</i>

72
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,587
<i>Proceed with caution</i>
<i>now, Tyree.</i>

73
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,758
Hah. You gonna
shoot out their tires?

74
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:39,994
It's half a mile away, Ranger.

75
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,199
You're a good shot,
but that's impossible.

76
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:56,711
That's six feet high.
Jesus, Alex.

77
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:13,594
Goddamn! That's some
shooting there, Ranger.

78
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:16,597
What happened?
What the fuck happened?

79
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:34,548
Shattered the block
and killed the engine.

80
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,952
Takes a big round to do that.

81
00:08:51,132 --> 00:08:54,101
Save your ammo!
You're not getting
a shot at that range.

82
00:08:54,135 --> 00:08:55,569
Are they shootin' at us?

83
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:02,109
We shot at him,
so he shot back,
you dumb fuck.

84
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,548
I'm leaving you, Tom.

85
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:10,117
You look after the horses,

86
00:09:11,152 --> 00:09:12,620
but know this,

87
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:15,256
I care more about
that horse than I do you.

88
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:35,109
I'll fire, you run,
then you cover me as I run.

89
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:36,177
Let's fucking go.

90
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,174
Agh! Fuck.

91
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:16,650
Agh, fuck!

92
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:18,185
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

93
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:50,017
Alex.

94
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:55,689
He's a wanted criminal, asshole.

95
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:57,391
I don't care
if he lives or dies.

96
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:59,793
Thanks a lot, brother man.

97
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:05,733
You got me.

98
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:40,502
Damn! Have I saw
a shooting like that before.

99
00:11:40,535 --> 00:11:43,337
Radio call said there
were four men, Ranger.

100
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,805
You gonna go
after the other guy?

101
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,243
Yeah, that other one
won't get far on his own.

102
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:51,045
Now you'll be letting me go,
huh, Ranger?

103
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:53,480
You going to jail, Tom.

104
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,352
I did suggest he knock first.

105
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:08,590
He was concerned since you
weren't answering your phone.

106
00:13:08,623 --> 00:13:12,459
That man is Special Agent
Derby of the FBI.

107
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:15,296
British Intelligence.

108
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:18,332
I take it you're
Ranger Alex Tyree?

109
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:21,268
Major Edwards said
we could find you here.

110
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:26,541
We'd like to come in
for a chat, if that's okay.

111
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,150
You all right?

112
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:39,286
Give me two minutes.

113
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:46,460
British Intelligence?

114
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,830
We're here with the approval
of your State Department.

115
00:13:50,632 --> 00:13:53,334
Special agent Derby
was tasked with making sure

116
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:55,169
I didn't get into trouble.

117
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:58,138
Well, he's lucky I didn't
shoot him through the door.

118
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,608
You have a lot
of enemies, Ranger?

119
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,245
I put people in jail.

120
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,247
They tend to take
offense to that.

121
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:10,618
I realize you have
a different way

122
00:14:10,652 --> 00:14:12,654
of handling things here, Ranger.

123
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:16,223
And it can be quite
difficult to grasp
from a desk in London, but...

124
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:20,628
we're very aware of the elite
investigative skills

125
00:14:20,662 --> 00:14:24,064
of the Texas Rangers,
and we know what you do works.

126
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:28,369
We're not some cowboy
operation, Agent Smith.

127
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:34,308
We go by the book,
just like they do in London.

128
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:36,944
I'm here because
Major Edwards said

129
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:38,345
you're the best ranger
he's ever seen,

130
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:42,149
so I've been sent to ask you
to go into Mexico

131
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:43,283
and collect a prisoner.

132
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:47,454
Federales won't allow
an official British
or US extraction,

133
00:14:47,488 --> 00:14:49,923
but unofficially,
they've asked for you.

134
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:52,192
You'll be there
as a private citizen.

135
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:55,195
If anything goes wrong,
our association will be
basically deniable

136
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:56,930
in every conceivable way.

137
00:14:56,964 --> 00:14:59,567
It's been nice meeting you,
Agent Smith.

138
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:00,968
Excuse me?

139
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:03,337
You got the wrong moron, lady.

140
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,239
Crossed the border myself.

141
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:06,608
Federales laughed in my face

142
00:15:06,641 --> 00:15:09,042
when I told them I was there
to extradite a prisoner.

143
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:12,647
I'm late for work.

144
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,582
Carmen here will see you out.

145
00:15:14,616 --> 00:15:17,384
The prisoner in question
is the bank robber

146
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:20,287
who killed the three deputies
in Esperanza County.

147
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:24,391
What is he to you?

148
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:26,994
His name is Declan McBride.

149
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:28,429
Ex-provisional IRA

150
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:31,365
wanted for a string
of terrorist activities

151
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,501
on and off the British mainland.

152
00:15:33,535 --> 00:15:37,037
He's extremely vicious
and very resourceful.

153
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,239
And if we don't move quick,

154
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:42,309
he will find a way
to negotiate himself out prison.

155
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:45,245
And what's an Irishman
doing robbing banks in Texas?

156
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,382
Well, he's gone rogue,
charging a small fee
to rob banks

157
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:52,085
and passing the proceeds
to the worst criminal
causes imaginable.

158
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:54,689
Through his old partner,

159
00:15:54,722 --> 00:15:58,392
we found out he's planning
a job on the British mainland.

160
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:03,063
I'm asking you to do this
on behalf of my country.

161
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:28,288
The English agents
insulted my intelligence

162
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:30,290
by attempting
to threaten me, Alex.

163
00:16:30,925 --> 00:16:33,661
I was tempted not to give him
an extradition at all,

164
00:16:33,695 --> 00:16:35,429
but then I thought of you.

165
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,565
I remembered you helped me
with a situation

166
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:40,100
that was very delicate.

167
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:43,638
That small act
had large consequences.

168
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:45,673
It made me indebted to you.

169
00:16:45,707 --> 00:16:47,274
Today I pay you back.

170
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:51,178
The simple extradition
will be now a deportation,

171
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:54,448
and the paperwork
is already filled out.

172
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:55,449
Right.

173
00:17:02,624 --> 00:17:04,726
Thanks for the hospitality.

174
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,493
Mexico's a lovely place.

175
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:08,295
You're welcome.

176
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:37,525
I can make it
worth your while
if you drop me off here.

177
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,059
Save your breath, partner.

178
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:56,410
I'm sorry
about the police officers.

179
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:58,278
Genuinely am,

180
00:17:58,312 --> 00:18:00,414
but I acted in the cause
of a greater good.

181
00:18:00,982 --> 00:18:03,785
How much more
of this is off-road?

182
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:06,286
Less than ten miles,
we'll be at the border cross.

183
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,790
Twenty minutes from there
we'll be in Nuevo Laredo.

184
00:18:09,524 --> 00:18:13,193
You know who led the first
successful revolution
against colonial empire?

185
00:18:13,895 --> 00:18:14,862
Huh?

186
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,164
George fucking Washington.

187
00:18:17,932 --> 00:18:20,668
See, justice is just
your perspective, Ranger.

188
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:24,772
Elements working here are far
bigger than the two of us.

189
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:27,609
You talk more than my ex-wife.

190
00:18:27,642 --> 00:18:29,309
Shame
of it is, Ranger,

191
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:31,546
I think I'd have liked
going up against you.

192
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:26,868
Good to see you again, boss.

193
00:19:26,901 --> 00:19:28,235
No injuries?

194
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:29,504
Only my pride, brother.

195
00:19:29,537 --> 00:19:32,439
I told you, the bank robbery
was a bad idea.

196
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:35,208
Next time I'll listen.
Go get that cop.

197
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:44,886
That's our cue, Oleg.

198
00:19:45,753 --> 00:19:47,220
He's seen your face.

199
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:48,422
Choose your battles.

200
00:21:10,805 --> 00:21:12,740
Two faces

201
00:21:12,774 --> 00:21:14,709
that warm the heart

202
00:21:14,742 --> 00:21:17,545
with memories of conflict past.

203
00:21:17,578 --> 00:21:21,949
We have walked through
the dark as friends.

204
00:21:24,552 --> 00:21:30,490
Which is better than to walk
through the light alone.

205
00:21:32,994 --> 00:21:34,095
Yuri.

206
00:21:34,128 --> 00:21:36,764
Declan. You will stay.

207
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:37,932
I have food

208
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:41,368
and Ukrainian vodka.

209
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:43,805
My men are peasants
but they raid well.

210
00:21:44,705 --> 00:21:46,107
Come.

211
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,943
We will toast to comrades lost.

212
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:58,753
It is unwise to refuse
the generosity of Cossack,

213
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:02,089
lest they change their minds.

214
00:22:02,123 --> 00:22:04,357
Appreciate the invitation.

215
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:06,093
We're on the job
, brother.

216
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:08,495
So it is business.

217
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:10,698
Mm-hmm.

218
00:22:18,606 --> 00:22:20,041
So, gentlemen,

219
00:22:21,843 --> 00:22:26,647
Cold War
155-millimeter-long gun.

220
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:30,551
It will fire
100-pound projectile

221
00:22:30,585 --> 00:22:32,720
14 miles on good day.

222
00:22:32,753 --> 00:22:34,055
And on a bad day?

223
00:22:34,088 --> 00:22:35,556
On bad day,

224
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,659
it will be the nightmare
that ends your life

225
00:22:38,693 --> 00:22:40,094
before you hear the sound.

226
00:22:41,596 --> 00:22:43,097
Have your men deliver
to this address.

227
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:45,533
I'll take it from there.

228
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:52,607
You know,

229
00:22:55,176 --> 00:23:00,380
I worry that you will upset
many people with this toy.

230
00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:03,618
I like you, Declan.

231
00:23:03,651 --> 00:23:05,418
You are like brother.

232
00:23:05,987 --> 00:23:10,992
But when this job is over,
then so are we.

233
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:21,969
I expected you to look worse.

234
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:29,143
You got a lot of nerve, lady.

235
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:31,045
You've every right
to be indignant.

236
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:33,014
You were ambushed,
likely set up,

237
00:23:33,047 --> 00:23:37,484
but you did your job, and
thank God you're still alive.

238
00:23:37,518 --> 00:23:39,687
Thank God I'm alive.

239
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,189
Ranger Daniels was a good man.

240
00:23:42,623 --> 00:23:45,793
He was a husband, father,

241
00:23:46,894 --> 00:23:49,130
and a damn fine lawman.

242
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:51,899
He was also my friend.

243
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:55,136
I'm sorry.

244
00:23:55,169 --> 00:23:56,203
Sorry?

245
00:23:58,172 --> 00:23:59,974
That ain't gonna cut it.

246
00:24:00,007 --> 00:24:02,510
But work with me, Tyree.

247
00:24:02,543 --> 00:24:04,045
Help me bring in McBride.

248
00:24:04,078 --> 00:24:06,914
You've seen him close-up,
talked to him.

249
00:24:06,948 --> 00:24:08,849
You know him better than
anyone else we have.

250
00:24:08,883 --> 00:24:10,518
I doubt that.

251
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:12,787
You knew they were gonna try
to spring him, didn't you?

252
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:17,992
Need to get yourself
another errand boy, lady.

253
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:20,194
If I go after McBride,

254
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:22,863
it's gonna be under my terms,

255
00:24:22,897 --> 00:24:25,666
with my men, and my rules.

256
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,902
Just sit down, please.

257
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:30,738
Ranger Tyree, please.

258
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:33,808
You got one good reason
why I should help you?

259
00:24:33,841 --> 00:24:37,011
You want a reason,
I'll give you multiple reasons.

260
00:24:37,044 --> 00:24:40,815
The 1993 killings
of US servicemen in Somalia.

261
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:43,150
The '98 bombings
of US embassies.

262
00:24:43,184 --> 00:24:45,653
The kidnapping of 16
Western tourists in Yemen

263
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:47,254
- that same year.
- Yemen?

264
00:24:47,288 --> 00:24:51,993
All executed and planned
by a man named Aden Kashmiri.

265
00:24:52,426 --> 00:24:56,297
Now, we believe Kashmiri
has retained McBride's services

266
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,099
for a substantial fee

267
00:24:58,132 --> 00:25:01,602
to cause or instigate
a terrorist event in London.

268
00:25:03,237 --> 00:25:05,740
McBride working for Kashmiri

269
00:25:05,773 --> 00:25:08,709
makes him the world's most
dangerous terrorist for hire.

270
00:25:09,577 --> 00:25:10,644
Keep talking.

271
00:25:11,112 --> 00:25:12,847
Help me track him down.

272
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,582
Do what you do.

273
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:22,189
Uh, the department
would have to sign off on it,

274
00:25:22,223 --> 00:25:26,227
and nothing really gels
around here that efficiently,

275
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,228
so...

276
00:25:31,966 --> 00:25:34,268
You've already talked
to the major, haven't ya?

277
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,341
Right.

278
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,722
You remind me of my dad.

279
00:25:56,357 --> 00:25:59,226
He was a police detective
in London.

280
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,028
We're in the East End.

281
00:26:01,062 --> 00:26:02,730
It used to be a rough area.

282
00:26:04,131 --> 00:26:06,634
He was killed on the job
when I was 17.

283
00:26:07,935 --> 00:26:10,071
Mm.

284
00:26:10,104 --> 00:26:11,605
Sorry to hear that.

285
00:26:12,139 --> 00:26:14,975
It was then and there I decided
to go into law enforcement.

286
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:16,143
Ah.

287
00:26:16,177 --> 00:26:19,046
Switched college courses
to criminal science,

288
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,882
was recruited straight
out of college by MI6.

289
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,118
You did all right.

290
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:27,088
He'd approve.

291
00:26:27,121 --> 00:26:29,690
Don't underestimate
McBride, Ranger.

292
00:26:30,424 --> 00:26:34,995
Declan is a sociopathic
murderer with a genius IQ.

293
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:38,132
Misjudged him once.

294
00:26:38,165 --> 00:26:39,366
Won't happen again.

295
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:41,202
I believe that.

296
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:46,073
I should ask.

297
00:26:46,107 --> 00:26:49,877
Do you plan on even
remotely trying to blend in?

298
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:59,019
I guess I could lose
the hat in London.

299
00:27:21,976 --> 00:27:25,412
Section Control Geddes.
Call me Chief Control

300
00:27:25,446 --> 00:27:28,149
or just Geddes.
We're informal here.

301
00:27:28,182 --> 00:27:31,252
- Who's "we"?
- The agency.

302
00:27:31,285 --> 00:27:33,420
We who ensure the security

303
00:27:33,454 --> 00:27:37,825
of the entire island nation
of Great Britain
and it's Commonwealth.

304
00:27:37,858 --> 00:27:39,426
Glad you can join us.

305
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:42,463
Alex Tyree.

306
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:44,765
Nice hat, very subtle.

307
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:47,201
I'll order you one.

308
00:27:47,234 --> 00:27:50,471
If you had to give a threat
assessment number out of ten,

309
00:27:50,505 --> 00:27:53,440
in your opinion, where
would Declan McBride sit?

310
00:27:53,474 --> 00:27:56,443
I don't rate 'em.
Just catch 'em and brand 'em.

311
00:27:56,477 --> 00:27:58,979
Mm. You actually talk like that.

312
00:28:00,281 --> 00:28:03,150
This asshole got away
from me once.

313
00:28:03,184 --> 00:28:05,252
I'll drop the boom
on him next time.

314
00:28:05,286 --> 00:28:08,923
You've been closer to him
than any living operative,

315
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:10,991
you've spoken to him
and survived.

316
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:13,928
That makes you
a temporary asset, Ranger.

317
00:28:13,961 --> 00:28:17,831
McBride is in London,
and it's our responsibility

318
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:20,734
to see to it
that he doesn't leave.

319
00:28:20,768 --> 00:28:22,169
Is that clear?

320
00:28:22,203 --> 00:28:24,506
Yeah, I get your drift, chief.

321
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:30,044
If you do something,
anything that reflects
poorly on the agency,

322
00:28:30,077 --> 00:28:32,279
asset status terminated.

323
00:28:32,313 --> 00:28:33,781
You're on your own, son.

324
00:28:33,814 --> 00:28:37,017
Am I crystal fucking clear?

325
00:28:37,051 --> 00:28:38,352
I'm not your son.

326
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:40,020
And I'm not your fucking daddy.

327
00:28:40,054 --> 00:28:42,256
Just answer
the question, cowboy.

328
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:44,091
We understand, Control.

329
00:28:44,124 --> 00:28:45,960
Thank you for accommodating us.

330
00:28:45,993 --> 00:28:48,162
And we will do everything
in our power

331
00:28:48,195 --> 00:28:50,164
to respect the agency's wishes

332
00:28:50,197 --> 00:28:52,534
and the discreet nature
of our position.

333
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:56,136
There'll be a detective
in the lobby, 7:30 a.m.

334
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,805
He's your liaison.

335
00:28:57,838 --> 00:29:01,275
You are not permitted to move
around the city without him.

336
00:29:01,308 --> 00:29:04,778
That five-peso star
affords you no more rights

337
00:29:04,812 --> 00:29:07,481
than any other guest
to this city.

338
00:29:07,515 --> 00:29:10,384
Agent Smith,
you're in the UK now.

339
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:14,021
Protocol is everything.

340
00:29:14,054 --> 00:29:15,256
Yes, Control.

341
00:29:18,526 --> 00:29:20,861
Okay. Seven and three-eighths.

342
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,298
My hat size.

343
00:29:35,976 --> 00:29:38,979
Yeah?
Who said you could stop?

344
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:43,917
You owe me more than that,
you lazy cunt.

345
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,421
Always a sweet talker.

346
00:29:58,265 --> 00:29:59,567
You shouldn't have left me.

347
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:02,836
You got what
shouldn't be gotten.

348
00:30:08,942 --> 00:30:10,311
I need your help, Angel.

349
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:16,483
I know.

350
00:30:17,418 --> 00:30:20,555
Knew it when I saw you.
Knew it when you made love.

351
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:24,425
Know it's the only reason
you're here now.

352
00:30:35,336 --> 00:30:36,370
Angel...

353
00:30:46,447 --> 00:30:48,282
Angel...

354
00:30:48,315 --> 00:30:49,983
Kid outside worships me.

355
00:30:51,085 --> 00:30:53,454
I give him kale and he'll
slice you into dozen pieces

356
00:30:53,487 --> 00:30:55,155
and throw you in the Thames.

357
00:30:57,091 --> 00:30:58,992
Shouldn't have done
what you did to me.

358
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:03,130
Swore if I ever saw you again,
I'd fuck you back.

359
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,638
So this is it?

360
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:16,210
You turned on too many
old friends, me included.

361
00:31:20,314 --> 00:31:21,882
Now you can leave.

362
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:37,699
Alex Tyree, you're in room 207.
 Elevator's to the left.

363
00:31:37,732 --> 00:31:40,334
- Thank you.
- Wanna walk off the cab ride?

364
00:31:40,367 --> 00:31:43,370
As opposed to a massage?

365
00:31:43,404 --> 00:31:45,139
Luke will take
any luggage for you.

366
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:49,511
Thank you, Luke.

367
00:31:49,544 --> 00:31:50,645
With pleasure, sir.

368
00:31:50,678 --> 00:31:52,246
Throw it on the bed.

369
00:31:57,585 --> 00:31:59,253
You call this April?

370
00:31:59,286 --> 00:32:02,022
Should've listened to Carmen
and wore a warmer jacket.

371
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,425
So you staying at the hotel?

372
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:07,161
Well, I lived in Langley
for three years.

373
00:32:07,194 --> 00:32:09,296
I don't keep a place
in the UK anymore.

374
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:11,566
Stranger in your own town, huh?

375
00:32:13,768 --> 00:32:16,036
Geddes wants us to work
with his babysitter

376
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:17,705
but they won't be here
till morning.

377
00:32:19,607 --> 00:32:21,942
This ain't a walk
for our health, is it?

378
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,077
It's a long shot.

379
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:26,180
There's a potential
intelligence source.

380
00:32:26,213 --> 00:32:28,148
- Taxi.
- Ah.

381
00:32:30,752 --> 00:32:33,420
Her name's Angel, ex-IRA,

382
00:32:33,454 --> 00:32:36,156
and she's got a real axe
to grind when it comes
to McBride.

383
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,425
Let's hope
she feels like talking.

384
00:33:26,774 --> 00:33:29,711
Nice company
you keep, Smith.

385
00:33:29,744 --> 00:33:33,113
People looking to stay
in our good grace,
you know how it is.

386
00:33:33,146 --> 00:33:34,749
No, I don't. Not really.

387
00:33:35,415 --> 00:33:37,519
I'm many things to many people,

388
00:33:37,552 --> 00:33:40,522
and today,
I get to call in a favor.

389
00:33:42,624 --> 00:33:43,691
Mm-hmm.

390
00:33:56,804 --> 00:33:59,239
Long time, no see,
you British cunt.

391
00:33:59,273 --> 00:34:02,577
How are you anyway,
filthy Irish trollop.

392
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,344
I was all right
until yous arrived

393
00:34:04,378 --> 00:34:06,714
stinking up my drinking space.

394
00:34:06,748 --> 00:34:08,348
Can I join you for a drink?

395
00:34:08,983 --> 00:34:11,719
Or is looking at your reflection
caused you to, you know,

396
00:34:11,753 --> 00:34:13,186
empty the bar already?

397
00:34:14,722 --> 00:34:16,390
You brought
your girlfriend here.

398
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,293
Part of the States
you're from, yeah?

399
00:34:19,326 --> 00:34:20,528
Texas, ma'am.

400
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:22,864
Great state of Texas.

401
00:34:22,897 --> 00:34:26,501
Well, you may want to invest
in some local wardrobe.

402
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:28,570
You stand out like
a baller in sweatpants.

403
00:34:29,904 --> 00:34:31,806
I know what yous want, Smith.

404
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,542
Hmm. Bad news travels fast.

405
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,444
Get outta here.

406
00:34:37,477 --> 00:34:39,246
Give us some privacy,
you fucking apes.

407
00:34:39,279 --> 00:34:42,449
I'm trying to have
a private conversation.

408
00:35:04,204 --> 00:35:06,541
Don't screw me around, Angel.

409
00:35:07,542 --> 00:35:09,109
You know me better than that.

410
00:35:11,846 --> 00:35:14,414
Sit down. Sit down.

411
00:35:16,183 --> 00:35:17,652
He's here in town, for sure.

412
00:35:18,452 --> 00:35:20,722
You're not gonna find him
without my help.

413
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:26,460
Why should I believe anything
you have to say about him?

414
00:35:26,493 --> 00:35:28,529
You're hardly
a disinterested party.

415
00:35:28,563 --> 00:35:29,831
I know what you're implying,

416
00:35:29,864 --> 00:35:31,799
but anything between
McBride and me died

417
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:33,568
when he took my fucking eye.

418
00:35:33,601 --> 00:35:37,572
Hmm. 'Cause I heard he saved
your life after the attack

419
00:35:37,605 --> 00:35:38,673
where you lost your eye.

420
00:35:39,206 --> 00:35:41,208
You heard fucking wrong.

421
00:35:41,241 --> 00:35:45,245
You expect me to believe
that any animosity
you have for McBride

422
00:35:45,278 --> 00:35:48,181
is motivation enough
to sully your reputation?

423
00:35:51,451 --> 00:35:52,820
- I want money.
- Ah.

424
00:35:52,854 --> 00:35:54,287
Cash money.

425
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:55,957
Man's fucking dangerous.

426
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:59,827
So in addition, I'll be wanting
three men released.

427
00:36:00,427 --> 00:36:03,230
Not parole, but released.

428
00:36:03,263 --> 00:36:06,166
These lads need a clean record
to get their year citizenship.

429
00:36:07,001 --> 00:36:08,936
So much harder since 9/11.

430
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:14,509
You can appreciate that,
don't you, Ranger?

431
00:36:16,511 --> 00:36:17,712
You don't have anything.

432
00:36:19,013 --> 00:36:21,214
I can negotiate
a visa entry.

433
00:36:23,751 --> 00:36:28,756
And arrange for leniency,
customs and immigrations

434
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,958
in extenuating
circumstances, you see.

435
00:36:32,527 --> 00:36:33,795
You have my word on it.

436
00:36:37,732 --> 00:36:40,835
<i>You'll find McBride</i>
<i>when you find Oleg.</i>

437
00:36:41,468 --> 00:36:44,939
<i>Checked in two days ago.</i>
<i>Room 27.</i>

438
00:36:44,972 --> 00:36:46,206
Right.

439
00:36:50,678 --> 00:36:51,746
Jesus.

440
00:36:57,518 --> 00:37:00,855
You sure take me
to the nicest places, Smith.

441
00:37:00,888 --> 00:37:02,657
Just make sure
you stay behind me.

442
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:03,725
Ahh.

443
00:37:06,694 --> 00:37:09,030
McBride finds out I'm in town,

444
00:37:09,063 --> 00:37:13,801
he'll go Casper on us,
which gives us hours not days.

445
00:37:13,835 --> 00:37:17,437
And time is of the essence.

446
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:21,308
What is that?

447
00:37:23,376 --> 00:37:25,947
They told me to leave
my .45 at home.

448
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,683
You are just an observer
here, Tyree.

449
00:37:28,716 --> 00:37:30,417
Study shows it's a lot
more dangerous

450
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,520
when law enforcement are armed.

451
00:37:32,553 --> 00:37:34,522
Weren't dangerous,
wouldn't need one.

452
00:37:41,495 --> 00:37:44,632
You think your sweet talking
Irish friend set us up?

453
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:47,702
That's always a possibility.
Check that way.

454
00:38:24,437 --> 00:38:25,773
What a rat's nest.

455
00:38:30,812 --> 00:38:32,013
Football.

456
00:39:02,777 --> 00:39:05,146
This is CSI Smith.
We need backup.

457
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:07,114
223 Green Street, Hackney.

458
00:39:07,148 --> 00:39:09,083
We have one armed suspect.

459
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:10,483
Automatic weapon.

460
00:39:10,518 --> 00:39:12,687
He has a gun.
We are receiving fire.

461
00:39:23,064 --> 00:39:24,966
You should have killed me
when you had the chance,
you motherfucker.

462
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,519
Stop! Stop! You fucking freeze.

463
00:39:45,553 --> 00:39:48,589
Don't you fucking dare. Agh!

464
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:53,828
Fuck! You okay?

465
00:39:53,861 --> 00:39:55,129
Go. Go.

466
00:40:03,004 --> 00:40:04,739
Hold it! Freeze!

467
00:40:12,647 --> 00:40:14,715
- You all right, mate?
- Tyree,
cease fire! Civilian!

468
00:40:20,988 --> 00:40:22,723
Police! Drop your gun! Now!

469
00:40:22,757 --> 00:40:24,792
No! This is MCA
official business.

470
00:40:24,825 --> 00:40:27,728
We're on active assignment.
Check my ID. Check it.

471
00:40:40,741 --> 00:40:43,978
Technical branch
performed a digital forensic

472
00:40:44,011 --> 00:40:46,681
on the cell phone
you acquired, Smith.

473
00:40:46,714 --> 00:40:49,183
Belongs to Oleg Jakovenko,

474
00:40:49,216 --> 00:40:54,221
McBride's second in command,
a worthy target of opportunity.

475
00:40:54,255 --> 00:40:56,791
Tragic that you
let him slip away.

476
00:40:58,259 --> 00:41:02,163
If Jakovenko is in London,
then McBride's nearby.

477
00:41:02,196 --> 00:41:05,199
Give me access to the data,
let me find him, Control.

478
00:41:06,934 --> 00:41:11,138
An arresting officer
has already gone on record

479
00:41:11,172 --> 00:41:14,875
saying that someone
in a cowboy hat

480
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:20,514
fired shots at a fleeing suspect
in a crowded area.

481
00:41:20,548 --> 00:41:25,619
Even allowing for certain
quaint West Texas customs,

482
00:41:26,253 --> 00:41:29,523
uh, wouldn't you agree that
that was quite reckless?

483
00:41:31,092 --> 00:41:33,160
Last time I saw him,

484
00:41:33,194 --> 00:41:36,097
he murdered my friend
and partner, chief.

485
00:41:39,033 --> 00:41:41,235
You don't forget a man
does that to you.

486
00:41:44,772 --> 00:41:48,809
Give me something that I can
take to the agency executive.

487
00:41:48,843 --> 00:41:51,979
Parliamentary council
is breathing down their necks.

488
00:41:52,013 --> 00:41:56,584
Nobody enjoys parrying
questions from Etonians

489
00:41:56,617 --> 00:41:59,620
with no concept
of field intelligence.

490
00:42:00,287 --> 00:42:03,858
They're actually already talking
about a possible scapegoat.

491
00:42:05,192 --> 00:42:07,661
Any reason I shouldn't
give them one?

492
00:42:07,695 --> 00:42:09,130
Ranger Tyree is the only asset

493
00:42:09,163 --> 00:42:11,766
that's seen Declan McBride
in person.

494
00:42:11,799 --> 00:42:13,968
We're British Intelligence.

495
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:16,570
We have considerable
assets, don't we?

496
00:42:16,604 --> 00:42:17,872
Use them.

497
00:42:17,905 --> 00:42:20,875
Convince me that
you are the right team

498
00:42:20,908 --> 00:42:22,243
for this assignment.

499
00:42:22,276 --> 00:42:24,712
I need concrete evidence

500
00:42:24,745 --> 00:42:27,314
that McBride is operating
on British soil.

501
00:42:27,348 --> 00:42:29,750
<i>Ad colligenda bona.</i>

502
00:42:31,252 --> 00:42:32,319
Thanks, boss.

503
00:42:33,421 --> 00:42:37,992
And I will also need
a written report, Ranger Tyree,

504
00:42:38,025 --> 00:42:39,994
about yesterday's action.

505
00:42:43,697 --> 00:42:46,033
I wasn't sure what
I thought of you, chief.

506
00:42:46,067 --> 00:42:49,570
I'm just a simple
operative like you.

507
00:42:50,805 --> 00:42:52,239
Perhaps.

508
00:42:52,273 --> 00:42:56,143
I'm sure we're gonna get
along very, very well, Ranger.

509
00:42:56,177 --> 00:42:57,578
Mm-hmm.

510
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,418
Count it.

511
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:38,752
I trust you.

512
00:43:38,786 --> 00:43:40,221
Don't ever trust a terrorist.

513
00:43:40,254 --> 00:43:43,157
It's just... I need
the moneys, desperately.

514
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:46,260
Mm. All men are desperate
one way or another.

515
00:43:47,795 --> 00:43:50,731
During the Troubles,
the British SAS,

516
00:43:50,764 --> 00:43:52,299
they had a Nemesis program

517
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:55,302
where they take Republican
prisoners into the woods

518
00:43:56,036 --> 00:43:57,104
and disappear them,

519
00:43:58,372 --> 00:43:59,807
never to be seen again.

520
00:44:01,008 --> 00:44:04,378
I'm gonna give more to your
family than the British gave us.

521
00:44:37,111 --> 00:44:38,679
Join me for a drink, Ranger?

522
00:44:40,214 --> 00:44:42,216
My stomach's saying breakfast,

523
00:44:43,284 --> 00:44:44,818
but a drink will do.

524
00:44:54,228 --> 00:44:56,764
You got family in the UK?

525
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:00,067
Scattered to the four winds.

526
00:45:03,337 --> 00:45:05,439
Mr. Smith, is he American?

527
00:45:07,274 --> 00:45:10,277
Oh. Mr. Smith was my father.

528
00:45:11,045 --> 00:45:15,115
Spend a lot of time in hotels,
so wedding ring's a deterrent.

529
00:45:15,149 --> 00:45:17,251
- Ah.
- I don't like small talk.

530
00:45:18,118 --> 00:45:22,691
Yeah. Tough to have a laugh
doing what we do.

531
00:45:25,893 --> 00:45:28,262
My ex-wife always wanted kids.

532
00:45:29,463 --> 00:45:32,833
I was never home long enough
to seal the deal.

533
00:45:34,435 --> 00:45:36,237
By the time I was ready,

534
00:45:37,471 --> 00:45:39,006
she'd already left me.

535
00:45:39,873 --> 00:45:42,876
Yeah, I wouldn't have
a relationship
in this line of work.

536
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:43,877
Mm.

537
00:45:45,212 --> 00:45:49,350
My father left a unfixable
void when he died.

538
00:45:50,384 --> 00:45:51,418
It's not fair.

539
00:45:54,388 --> 00:45:58,192
What would your next step be
if we were in Texas?

540
00:45:58,225 --> 00:45:59,260
Hunt him

541
00:46:00,227 --> 00:46:01,328
relentlessly.

542
00:46:03,264 --> 00:46:05,899
I convinced technical branch

543
00:46:05,933 --> 00:46:09,370
to share the data transcript
from Oleg's phone.

544
00:46:11,238 --> 00:46:13,040
We were able to trace a number.

545
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:17,077
Initiative, Smith. I like it.

546
00:46:18,312 --> 00:46:19,880
Here's to that.

547
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,892
Thank you
for your hospitality.

548
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:18,172
They'll have more reinforcements.
 We have to move!

549
00:47:20,908 --> 00:47:22,876
Get to the street
and don't look back. Go.

550
00:47:55,943 --> 00:47:57,010
Come on, let's have you.

551
00:47:57,044 --> 00:47:58,212
The woman shot me.

552
00:47:58,245 --> 00:47:59,346
Get the fuck in.

553
00:48:11,626 --> 00:48:16,296
It's gonna sting.

554
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:18,065
- All right.
- Ugh.

555
00:48:18,098 --> 00:48:19,601
- You're tough.
- Mm.

556
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,303
- There we go.
- They targeted us.

557
00:48:23,805 --> 00:48:25,573
That means we've got
their attention.

558
00:48:25,607 --> 00:48:28,208
Well, if he's smart,

559
00:48:28,242 --> 00:48:32,179
he'll cancel whatever plans
he has and break camp.

560
00:48:32,212 --> 00:48:33,414
Then we've lost him.

561
00:48:35,082 --> 00:48:37,619
You need to rest this arm.

562
00:48:37,652 --> 00:48:39,420
Your system's going into shock.

563
00:48:41,488 --> 00:48:45,926
You'll get sleepy,
but that's okay. I'll be here.

564
00:48:49,029 --> 00:48:50,431
All right, little press.

565
00:48:50,464 --> 00:48:52,667
Ah.

566
00:48:55,637 --> 00:48:56,671
Hm.

567
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,942
You did good today.

568
00:49:03,545 --> 00:49:06,614
Went against him
when he had you dead to rights.

569
00:49:08,215 --> 00:49:10,718
Yeah, you saved my life.

570
00:49:12,286 --> 00:49:16,089
Gave, uh, them folks
a reason to run.

571
00:49:16,123 --> 00:49:20,060
Probably got yourself into
a lot of trouble with Control.

572
00:49:20,093 --> 00:49:22,062
That takes guts.

573
00:49:22,095 --> 00:49:24,164
With that little pistol too.

574
00:49:24,198 --> 00:49:26,233
Don't knock my little pistol.

575
00:49:26,266 --> 00:49:28,503
I'm gonna dig us up some grub,

576
00:49:28,536 --> 00:49:31,338
Shock wears off, it leaves
a hell of an appetite.

577
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:34,241
Thank you, Ranger.

578
00:49:35,543 --> 00:49:36,578
Alex.

579
00:49:37,478 --> 00:49:39,313
Thank you, Alex.

580
00:49:39,346 --> 00:49:40,648
Don't want you coming after me

581
00:49:40,682 --> 00:49:42,517
with that little
pistol of yours.

582
00:49:51,225 --> 00:49:52,594
Ah. There you go.

583
00:49:57,231 --> 00:49:59,534
Here. Drink will make you
feel better.

584
00:50:01,569 --> 00:50:03,437
Here you go.

585
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:05,507
Reggie, bring that down
to the man.

586
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,241
Good boy.

587
00:50:19,486 --> 00:50:22,222
I have fond memories
of our time together, Declan,

588
00:50:22,256 --> 00:50:24,224
but I can't say I'm happy
about seeing you

589
00:50:24,258 --> 00:50:25,627
under these circumstances.

590
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:27,060
We need to talk.

591
00:50:29,396 --> 00:50:30,497
In front of the boy?

592
00:50:30,532 --> 00:50:32,432
Ah, don't worry about him.

593
00:50:32,466 --> 00:50:35,202
Our special, sweet-minded boy.

594
00:50:35,235 --> 00:50:37,070
God chose to touch his mind.

595
00:50:38,873 --> 00:50:40,675
Declan...

596
00:50:40,708 --> 00:50:43,578
what you do now,
you do for the love of chaos.

597
00:50:44,044 --> 00:50:45,580
It's not what you were.

598
00:50:45,613 --> 00:50:47,582
We were part of something
bigger than us.

599
00:50:47,615 --> 00:50:51,719
There's a certain grace
in crusading for lost causes.

600
00:50:51,753 --> 00:50:53,688
I'm finished
with lost causes, doc.

601
00:50:56,323 --> 00:50:59,226
Reggie, give us
a song, will you?

602
00:50:59,259 --> 00:51:01,629
"The Foggy Dew." Good lad.

603
00:51:01,663 --> 00:51:03,531
I thought you said
he didn't talk.

604
00:51:03,565 --> 00:51:07,467
He doesn't talk,
but he does sing.

605
00:51:51,879 --> 00:51:55,248
Good lad, good lad. Well done.

606
00:51:58,653 --> 00:52:00,220
Angel's been talking.

607
00:52:01,488 --> 00:52:05,325
Three of our men,
prisoners in Belmarsh Prison

608
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:07,862
had their sentences exonerated.

609
00:52:07,895 --> 00:52:09,363
Word on the street...

610
00:52:10,865 --> 00:52:12,834
diplomatic pressure from above.

611
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:15,302
If you got something to say,

612
00:52:16,203 --> 00:52:17,471
then you spit it out.

613
00:52:18,506 --> 00:52:19,941
You're on your own now, Declan,

614
00:52:19,974 --> 00:52:23,310
everyone is turning
against you, even her.

615
00:52:24,311 --> 00:52:25,412
Even your angel.

616
00:52:25,445 --> 00:52:26,681
You don't know anything.

617
00:52:26,714 --> 00:52:28,583
What I did for your friend
over there

618
00:52:28,616 --> 00:52:30,551
is my repayment
to the debt I owe you.

619
00:52:32,553 --> 00:52:33,921
When you leave here tonight,

620
00:52:36,691 --> 00:52:37,892
don't ever come back.

621
00:52:54,709 --> 00:52:55,743
Bingo.

622
00:53:02,784 --> 00:53:03,918
Oh.

623
00:53:03,951 --> 00:53:05,753
I found us some food,

624
00:53:05,787 --> 00:53:07,454
if you can call it that.

625
00:53:07,487 --> 00:53:08,523
Listen.

626
00:53:09,557 --> 00:53:11,826
I had a friend
dig a little deeper

627
00:53:11,859 --> 00:53:13,995
- on Oleg Jakovenko.
- Oh, yeah?

628
00:53:14,028 --> 00:53:16,731
Sentenced to 40 years
hard labor

629
00:53:16,764 --> 00:53:20,001
in Lukianivska Prison
for war crimes.

630
00:53:20,034 --> 00:53:21,803
Here, you should eat something.

631
00:53:21,836 --> 00:53:23,270
I don't eat pork.

632
00:53:23,303 --> 00:53:25,540
He escaped with McBride
and two other prisoners,

633
00:53:25,573 --> 00:53:27,340
and during the escape,

634
00:53:27,374 --> 00:53:29,777
Oleg killed the two guards
who were watching McBride.

635
00:53:31,311 --> 00:53:33,948
Yeah, sounds like
a real charmer.

636
00:53:33,981 --> 00:53:35,482
Oh, yeah.

637
00:53:35,516 --> 00:53:39,352
Interpol alert for Northern
Ireland, Libya, Iran,

638
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:41,589
Chechnya, Bosnia, Rwanda.

639
00:53:41,622 --> 00:53:45,225
I mean, the list reads like
a soldier of fortune world tour.

640
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:48,328
Look, McBride's
planning something.

641
00:53:48,361 --> 00:53:50,464
But why did he break cover
to kill you?

642
00:53:51,465 --> 00:53:53,000
Well, he ain't special.

643
00:53:53,768 --> 00:53:56,904
I bring him in,
head down over the saddle,

644
00:53:56,938 --> 00:53:59,439
just like any other horse thief.

645
00:54:00,307 --> 00:54:02,543
I forget that's how
you actually speak.

646
00:54:04,612 --> 00:54:06,814
I had an instructor
used to tell us,

647
00:54:06,848 --> 00:54:09,382
there's two types in this game.

648
00:54:10,151 --> 00:54:13,588
Those on the run,
and those doing the hunting.

649
00:54:14,655 --> 00:54:17,892
And, man, McBride's a man
on the run, that's all.

650
00:54:17,925 --> 00:54:19,493
Hmm.

651
00:54:19,527 --> 00:54:23,598
The address on the Ukrainian
cell phone could be nothing.

652
00:54:25,566 --> 00:54:26,601
Wanna go look?

653
00:54:32,507 --> 00:54:35,676
What could possibly
go wrong?

654
00:54:48,656 --> 00:54:51,424
I'm thinking maybe
this is McBride's safe house.

655
00:54:52,425 --> 00:54:53,761
We bust enough of 'em,

656
00:54:53,795 --> 00:54:56,831
think it'll get us back
in good graces with Control?

657
00:55:08,441 --> 00:55:11,512
Get off the phone.
Get off the fucking phone.

658
00:55:11,546 --> 00:55:12,780
- And who the fuck are you?
- Ah.

659
00:55:13,614 --> 00:55:15,716
- Get off the phone.
- What the fuck are you doing?

660
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:18,052
- Get up.
- What are you-- Ow!

661
00:55:18,085 --> 00:55:21,354
Anya, who did you call?

662
00:55:21,388 --> 00:55:23,356
Fucking Tooth Fairy.
Who do you think?

663
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:26,093
- He's upstairs.
- How did you know?

664
00:55:26,127 --> 00:55:29,831
Well, he's written
"Russian gangster,
Room 212" right here.

665
00:55:29,864 --> 00:55:32,834
- Seriously?
- I did not fucking write that.

666
00:55:32,867 --> 00:55:34,702
Sit the fuck down.
Don't fucking move.

667
00:55:34,735 --> 00:55:35,803
Fucking hell.

668
00:55:40,074 --> 00:55:41,374
Yes, ma'am.

669
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:44,612
Getting that déjà vu feeling.

670
00:55:44,645 --> 00:55:46,147
You wanna call for backup?

671
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,615
Please.

672
00:55:47,648 --> 00:55:49,050
Don't touch any firearms.

673
00:56:03,598 --> 00:56:05,533
Did he really write
"Russian gangster"?

674
00:56:05,566 --> 00:56:07,969
No. I just wanted
to see his reaction.

675
00:56:09,637 --> 00:56:12,506
This is the only occupied room.

676
00:56:15,176 --> 00:56:17,444
Freedom fighting is many things,

677
00:56:18,212 --> 00:56:19,914
but glamorous it isn't.

678
00:56:33,027 --> 00:56:36,163
Irishman's tied
a tin can to our tail.

679
00:56:37,999 --> 00:56:40,735
Fuck. Fire escape?

680
00:56:40,768 --> 00:56:42,837
Nah, he'd have thought of that.

681
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:43,905
So?

682
00:56:44,939 --> 00:56:46,540
We got the advantage.

683
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:48,441
How's that?

684
00:56:51,979 --> 00:56:53,915
He thinks he got the drop on us.

685
00:56:53,948 --> 00:56:55,216
On my mother's,
I catched him.

686
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:57,518
I won't tell him a word.
I promise.

687
00:56:57,551 --> 00:56:58,819
Please, they came
bowling in here.

688
00:56:58,853 --> 00:57:00,453
I didn't even get
a fucking chance to speak.

689
00:57:00,487 --> 00:57:01,889
They took my phone
off me and all.

690
00:57:01,923 --> 00:57:05,092
Oh, God!

691
00:58:04,552 --> 00:58:05,953
Have you stopped
shooting my men?

692
00:58:07,955 --> 00:58:10,024
Becoming very difficult
to find gunmen.

693
00:58:10,992 --> 00:58:13,794
But after these ones,
what am I gonna do?

694
00:58:13,828 --> 00:58:15,696
Put your fucking hands up!

695
00:58:23,704 --> 00:58:26,140
I knew you weren't dead
when I left you in desert.

696
00:58:27,108 --> 00:58:29,777
I told him it was a mistake
not to finish you.

697
00:58:30,778 --> 00:58:33,647
Will you
pass me a napkin, Ranger?

698
00:58:36,183 --> 00:58:37,551
Something in my eye.

699
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:55,169
Why are you
with this outfit, Oleg?

700
00:58:56,804 --> 00:59:00,541
Discretion is like
the calcium in my bones, Ranger.

701
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,782
You could help me
bring him in.

702
00:59:10,751 --> 00:59:13,721
When you're in Texas, we say,

703
00:59:14,822 --> 00:59:17,858
first to talk
is the first to walk.

704
00:59:18,426 --> 00:59:21,962
He's waited a long time
to see this city burn.

705
01:01:54,516 --> 01:01:56,850
- Stop!
- Government agent.

706
01:01:56,884 --> 01:01:59,386
I got a government agent here.

707
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:01,088
You do fine, easy fellas.

708
01:02:02,289 --> 01:02:04,058
One suspect.

709
01:02:04,091 --> 01:02:06,528
I have an injured suspect
wearing an IED explosive vest.

710
01:02:06,561 --> 01:02:08,162
We need a bomb squad here now!

711
01:02:08,195 --> 01:02:09,463
Go get 'em, fellas.

712
01:02:31,352 --> 01:02:33,020
An embarrassing result.

713
01:02:33,053 --> 01:02:34,755
Ah, we look good together.

714
01:02:35,523 --> 01:02:38,425
Uh, perhaps not
the kind of image

715
01:02:38,459 --> 01:02:41,895
the agency is hoping to purvey.

716
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:45,366
Can either of you give me
a reason why I don't punish you

717
01:02:45,399 --> 01:02:48,002
to the full extent
of my authority?

718
01:02:48,035 --> 01:02:52,139
We except full responsibility
for the indiscretion, Control.

719
01:02:52,172 --> 01:02:55,075
An explanation will be outlined
in detail in my report.

720
01:02:55,109 --> 01:02:56,143
Mm-hmm.

721
01:02:56,810 --> 01:03:00,781
You've had a promising
career up to now, Agent Smith.

722
01:03:01,616 --> 01:03:06,120
Expert in diplomatic
protocol and procedure.

723
01:03:06,153 --> 01:03:10,991
Frankly, I am shocked
by your reckless behavior.

724
01:03:11,425 --> 01:03:13,327
Having said that,

725
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:17,231
evidence we recovered led us
to a nuclear scientist

726
01:03:17,264 --> 01:03:19,900
with a painkiller addiction.

727
01:03:20,602 --> 01:03:24,204
It seems that he sold a quantity

728
01:03:24,238 --> 01:03:29,176
of high isotope
uranium 235 to McBride.

729
01:03:29,209 --> 01:03:31,011
He's making a dirty bomb?

730
01:03:31,613 --> 01:03:34,248
We're putting every agent
in the field.

731
01:03:34,281 --> 01:03:38,419
Intel says McBride will be
ready to strike next week.

732
01:03:38,886 --> 01:03:40,487
We need to get to work then.

733
01:03:40,522 --> 01:03:45,359
Eleven EOD has one
of your shooters in isolation.

734
01:03:45,392 --> 01:03:49,029
He was wearing a suicide vest
that failed to detonate.

735
01:03:49,063 --> 01:03:51,298
Fortune favors the bold.

736
01:03:51,832 --> 01:03:54,935
Drop a logistics waiver
and get over there.

737
01:03:55,969 --> 01:03:57,037
Quickish.

738
01:04:04,646 --> 01:04:06,980
Information on the
prisoner's family.

739
01:04:07,014 --> 01:04:08,516
Tell me
about the ordinance.

740
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:10,217
Layered PD4 derivative,

741
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:12,252
detonator enveloped
inside the accelerant.

742
01:04:13,253 --> 01:04:14,522
High pressure water cutter?

743
01:04:15,289 --> 01:04:18,992
There's an RDX crystal
compound on the detonator,

744
01:04:19,026 --> 01:04:21,061
safeguards against tampering.

745
01:04:21,095 --> 01:04:23,598
I haven't seen anything this
advanced since the EOD school.

746
01:04:27,067 --> 01:04:28,435
Open the security door.

747
01:04:29,537 --> 01:04:31,405
I wish to talk to the prisoner.

748
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:39,446
This guy hear us
through this thing?

749
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,115
I can turn on two-way
for you, sir.

750
01:04:45,419 --> 01:04:48,523
McBride talked you
into blowing yourself up.

751
01:04:48,556 --> 01:04:50,491
What's your family
think about that?

752
01:04:50,525 --> 01:04:53,360
"Every soul shall
have a taste of death."

753
01:04:53,394 --> 01:04:55,663
"But only on the day
of judgment

754
01:04:55,697 --> 01:04:57,665
shall you be paid in full."

755
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:00,568
You know the words?

756
01:05:00,602 --> 01:05:01,636
I do.

757
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:05,239
They are just
words to you.

758
01:05:06,206 --> 01:05:08,342
Gor. Gor.

759
01:05:08,909 --> 01:05:11,211
How do we find Declan McBride?

760
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,147
You have your mission.

761
01:05:14,516 --> 01:05:16,651
Mine is to protect my family.

762
01:05:17,752 --> 01:05:21,121
Full diplomatic protection.

763
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:24,291
They'll be in a secure location
by tomorrow morning.

764
01:05:24,324 --> 01:05:25,426
You have my word.

765
01:05:30,197 --> 01:05:31,365
He's gonna do it.

766
01:05:32,634 --> 01:05:33,967
I love them.

767
01:05:35,637 --> 01:05:37,037
He has left.

768
01:05:38,372 --> 01:05:39,607
What?

769
01:05:39,641 --> 01:05:42,075
He spoke about finding
a glass skylight,

770
01:05:43,678 --> 01:05:45,747
a window from a tall building.

771
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:48,348
When? Where?

772
01:05:48,382 --> 01:05:50,150
Overlooking the river.

773
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:53,120
The ancient clock.

774
01:05:54,321 --> 01:05:56,023
Where you don't buy hope.

775
01:05:56,758 --> 01:05:58,125
Come what may.

776
01:06:00,227 --> 01:06:02,429
Today is not the end of history.

777
01:06:04,632 --> 01:06:05,999
No...

778
01:06:06,033 --> 01:06:07,569
Oh, boy.

779
01:06:07,602 --> 01:06:09,537
RDX relay
has been engaged.

780
01:06:11,171 --> 01:06:13,273
<i>You have 30 seconds</i>
<i>to get out of there, Smith.</i>

781
01:06:13,307 --> 01:06:14,408
Gor...

782
01:06:14,441 --> 01:06:16,343
Show them where
to find my family.

783
01:06:16,376 --> 01:06:17,545
Gor, can you disarm it?

784
01:06:19,146 --> 01:06:20,582
Gor, can you disarm it?

785
01:06:21,448 --> 01:06:23,751
Disarm it! Gor!

786
01:06:26,788 --> 01:06:28,590
- Smith, get outta there.
- Gor!

787
01:06:28,623 --> 01:06:31,124
<i>The agent needs</i>
<i>to exit the bomb bay now.</i>

788
01:06:45,472 --> 01:06:46,674
What a waste.

789
01:06:46,708 --> 01:06:48,576
Not to his way of thinking.

790
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:51,044
Delusions of grandeur.

791
01:06:51,078 --> 01:06:52,780
Hebephrenic schizophrenia.

792
01:06:52,814 --> 01:06:56,751
In Texas, we'd say not enough
cotton balls on a bush

793
01:06:56,784 --> 01:06:59,253
to haul a full trailer
to the gin...

794
01:06:59,286 --> 01:07:00,755
if you know
what I'm saying.

795
01:07:01,388 --> 01:07:04,559
Eh, he thinks
he's one of his heroes.

796
01:07:04,592 --> 01:07:07,595
Michael Collins.
George Washington.

797
01:07:07,629 --> 01:07:10,598
Struggling against the British.
Wants fame.

798
01:07:11,131 --> 01:07:14,268
Mm, it's not much use
if you're dead or in prison.

799
01:07:14,301 --> 01:07:16,538
Mm, thought process
don't work like that.

800
01:07:17,271 --> 01:07:21,776
McKinley's assassin bought
a pearl-handled revolver

801
01:07:21,809 --> 01:07:26,548
so it would look nice
in a museum next to his photo.

802
01:07:27,749 --> 01:07:29,149
It's not next week.

803
01:07:30,117 --> 01:07:31,586
It's in two days.

804
01:07:31,619 --> 01:07:33,253
April 24th.

805
01:07:33,287 --> 01:07:35,422
The Easter Monday uprising
against the British,

806
01:07:35,455 --> 01:07:38,258
April 24th, 1916.

807
01:07:38,292 --> 01:07:41,663
Ancient clock. Big Ben
near Houses of Parliament.

808
01:07:41,696 --> 01:07:43,531
He's gonna launch a dirty bomb.

809
01:07:43,565 --> 01:07:44,632
Not bad.

810
01:07:45,633 --> 01:07:49,604
But you got there 'cause
of my comment about
Michael Collins, didn't you?

811
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:51,506
Really?

812
01:07:58,211 --> 01:08:02,684
In 1954, French forces
suffered a defeat so definitive

813
01:08:02,717 --> 01:08:05,252
that they withdrew
all colonial forces

814
01:08:05,285 --> 01:08:07,120
and quit the conflict
in Indochina.

815
01:08:07,789 --> 01:08:09,691
To surprise the French,

816
01:08:09,724 --> 01:08:12,527
Viet men had attacked
from mountains overlooking
the French positions,

817
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:15,730
dismantling their artillery
and carried on bicycles

818
01:08:15,763 --> 01:08:17,899
on women's backs
up into the mountain.

819
01:08:17,932 --> 01:08:20,200
In front of me, Mr. Kashmiri,

820
01:08:20,233 --> 01:08:22,870
is a 152-millimeter Howitzer

821
01:08:22,904 --> 01:08:25,640
smuggled into the country
piece by piece.

822
01:08:25,673 --> 01:08:27,140
Reassembled

823
01:08:27,174 --> 01:08:29,309
and aimed directly
at the House of Parliament.

824
01:08:30,177 --> 01:08:33,280
<i>You have performed your task</i>
<i>remarkably, Brother McBride.</i>

825
01:08:34,816 --> 01:08:37,284
<i>Now I must ask you</i>
<i>to step away.</i>

826
01:08:37,317 --> 01:08:38,385
Step away?

827
01:08:38,853 --> 01:08:41,923
This is the single greatest
terrorist plot since 9/11

828
01:08:41,956 --> 01:08:43,423
and you're asking me
to stand down

829
01:08:43,457 --> 01:08:44,759
before the command performance?

830
01:08:44,792 --> 01:08:47,427
<i>The threat is greater</i>
<i>than the act.</i>

831
01:08:47,461 --> 01:08:50,263
<i>Until it is proved that</i>
<i>we can do what we promise,</i>

832
01:08:51,599 --> 01:08:53,801
<i>we can negotiate our demands.</i>

833
01:08:53,835 --> 01:08:55,168
Demands?

834
01:08:56,638 --> 01:08:58,706
You're just another
fucking politician.

835
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:00,808
<i>I am Aden Kashmiri!</i>

836
01:09:00,842 --> 01:09:02,476
<i>Your spiritual leader!</i>

837
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:06,748
<i>You will do as I command</i>
<i>and stand down, McBride.</i>

838
01:09:06,781 --> 01:09:08,315
<i>Stand down!</i>

839
01:09:08,348 --> 01:09:11,451
<i>The blood of the prophet</i>
<i>runs in me. Don't do it!</i>

840
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:38,613
I thought you'd quit.

841
01:09:40,447 --> 01:09:43,551
Killed Protestants in the name
of the Catholic faith.

842
01:09:45,653 --> 01:09:47,320
Buddhists in the name of China.

843
01:09:47,822 --> 01:09:49,724
Hindus in the name of Buddha.

844
01:09:49,757 --> 01:09:51,425
I killed Christians
in the name of Islam,

845
01:09:51,458 --> 01:09:52,794
and now they ask me to stop.

846
01:09:59,266 --> 01:10:02,269
Bloody religions.
To hell, them all.

847
01:10:11,012 --> 01:10:12,279
I'll drink to that.

848
01:10:16,951 --> 01:10:18,385
The ranger will be coming.

849
01:10:27,695 --> 01:10:29,396
Time to finish old business.

850
01:10:29,831 --> 01:10:30,865
Let's go.

851
01:10:46,446 --> 01:10:47,849
Chopper unit with FLIR

852
01:10:47,882 --> 01:10:50,350
discovered an off-the-charts
radium deposit.

853
01:10:50,383 --> 01:10:53,821
Requires at least
50 pounds of isotope

854
01:10:53,855 --> 01:10:55,355
to give off a reading
that intense.

855
01:10:55,388 --> 01:10:56,490
Thanks, sir.

856
01:10:56,524 --> 01:10:58,526
I served in Kyrgyzstan
and Syria, Ranger.

857
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:01,763
You don't see it.
You don't smell it.

858
01:11:01,796 --> 01:11:02,997
You don't hear it.

859
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:04,966
It kills absolutely
and without warning.

860
01:11:04,999 --> 01:11:06,701
I am not sending
my men in there.

861
01:11:06,734 --> 01:11:08,636
- But I need to go in.
- Well, you can do as you wish,

862
01:11:08,669 --> 01:11:10,470
but you're gonna have to wait
until the area's evacuated.

863
01:11:10,505 --> 01:11:11,572
Evacuated?

864
01:11:11,606 --> 01:11:13,440
I ordered a two-mile
radius evacuated,

865
01:11:13,473 --> 01:11:16,443
and when it is,
I'm hitting that building
with a JDAM explosive missile.

866
01:11:16,476 --> 01:11:18,980
I need time.
We need this guy alive.

867
01:11:19,013 --> 01:11:21,749
He's our only link
to Aden Kashmiri.

868
01:11:22,415 --> 01:11:25,418
A JDAM missile
will take out the entire block.

869
01:11:25,452 --> 01:11:26,821
Give me two rocket launchers

870
01:11:26,854 --> 01:11:28,589
on the building
across the street,

871
01:11:28,623 --> 01:11:29,857
and wait for my order.

872
01:11:32,727 --> 01:11:34,562
<i>I can give you</i>
<i>30 minutes, Smith,</i>

873
01:11:34,595 --> 01:11:36,731
<i>and then we're hitting</i>
<i>the building whether</i>
<i>you're out or not.</i>

874
01:11:36,764 --> 01:11:37,799
<i>Am I clear?</i>

875
01:11:42,069 --> 01:11:43,771
We need to be careful.

876
01:11:43,805 --> 01:11:45,873
We don't want McBride
triggering this thing.

877
01:11:47,008 --> 01:11:49,076
We'll catch him
like a rabbit.

878
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:51,712
Cage will be on him
before he knows what hit him.

879
01:12:22,610 --> 01:12:24,011
I'll take care of this guy.

880
01:12:25,546 --> 01:12:27,715
I'll go upstairs,
I'll wait for you.

881
01:12:49,971 --> 01:12:51,639
Security building's
been breached.

882
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:58,846
By a tall piece of piss
wearing a ten-gallon hat.

883
01:13:01,716 --> 01:13:02,917
Oleg will take care of it.

884
01:13:05,753 --> 01:13:06,821
Move out.

885
01:13:12,693 --> 01:13:13,828
Ranger.

886
01:13:17,665 --> 01:13:18,833
We're getting old,

887
01:13:19,533 --> 01:13:22,870
and the men we break in
are just getting younger.

888
01:13:22,904 --> 01:13:26,040
I drink vodka in the morning
to ease the pain of a long life.

889
01:13:30,511 --> 01:13:32,613
<i>Is that machine gun fire</i>
<i>I'm hearing, Smith?</i>

890
01:13:32,647 --> 01:13:34,615
I need more time, lieutenant,
you gotta give me something.

891
01:13:34,649 --> 01:13:35,917
<i>You have 25 minutes left.</i>

892
01:13:47,628 --> 01:13:50,698
Modern ammunition
wait for no man, Ranger.

893
01:13:55,803 --> 01:13:57,605
We never finished our dance.

894
01:13:58,506 --> 01:14:00,007
This is ridiculous.

895
01:14:01,042 --> 01:14:02,143
Look at us.

896
01:14:03,244 --> 01:14:05,980
Maybe. But you took my eye.

897
01:14:06,013 --> 01:14:08,716
Each time we meet,
you get the worst of it.

898
01:14:10,117 --> 01:14:11,953
Beginner's luck. Ha.

899
01:14:11,986 --> 01:14:15,957
Three times?
Throw in the towel, son.

900
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:18,960
Maybe I got hit in the head
too many times, Ranger.

901
01:14:18,993 --> 01:14:24,131
But to get to him,
you must go through me.

902
01:16:24,652 --> 01:16:26,087
Stay down, Oleg.

903
01:16:26,821 --> 01:16:28,222
Not possible.

904
01:16:28,255 --> 01:16:30,357
It don't need to be like this.

905
01:16:49,743 --> 01:16:50,811
Fuck.

906
01:16:51,979 --> 01:16:53,647
What the fuck?

907
01:16:53,681 --> 01:16:55,916
You look like you've
been hit by a truck.

908
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:59,053
- I'm just an observer, Smith.
- Only that was like

909
01:16:59,086 --> 01:17:01,989
the fourth fucking time.

910
01:17:02,022 --> 01:17:04,692
Just need to catch my breath.

911
01:17:04,725 --> 01:17:06,127
Okay, I mean, take a minute,

912
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:10,064
- but we kind of need to go.
- I'm good to go.

913
01:17:10,097 --> 01:17:11,332
You sure?

914
01:17:11,365 --> 01:17:13,367
- Good to go.
- Okay, take this gun.

915
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:16,370
We've got 20 minutes.

916
01:17:16,403 --> 01:17:18,839
McBride is dug in
on the seventh floor.

917
01:17:21,809 --> 01:17:22,843
Right.

918
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:28,916
The raw isotope has now
impregnated the explosive.

919
01:17:28,949 --> 01:17:30,885
RDD is ready for
the final mission, sir.

920
01:17:35,624 --> 01:17:38,826
I don't expect allegiance from
any of you when the job's done.

921
01:17:39,628 --> 01:17:42,429
I'll understand if you
and your men want to cut out.

922
01:17:42,463 --> 01:17:45,199
We've spoken about it,
and we stand by you.

923
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:50,871
No one else fucking has.

924
01:17:54,074 --> 01:17:55,142
Not women,

925
01:17:56,911 --> 01:17:57,978
family,

926
01:17:59,446 --> 01:18:00,981
even friends.

927
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:04,952
Yous the only ones that have.

928
01:18:07,221 --> 01:18:08,355
Well, then,

929
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:10,891
Let's get to it, shall we?

930
01:18:27,808 --> 01:18:29,310
All 11 targets painted, ma'am.

931
01:18:29,777 --> 01:18:31,412
<i>Ready to engage</i>
<i>at your command.</i>

932
01:18:34,181 --> 01:18:36,850
You're a hundred percent sure
you can neutralize the threat?

933
01:18:36,884 --> 01:18:38,752
<i>They have not armed</i>
<i>the uranium device.</i>

934
01:18:38,786 --> 01:18:41,422
We can hit them now, but the
window closes if they arm it.

935
01:18:41,455 --> 01:18:43,057
We are on the sixth floor,

936
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:44,792
so just keep
that fire localized.

937
01:18:44,825 --> 01:18:46,528
You may wanna brace
for this, Ranger.

938
01:18:46,561 --> 01:18:49,797
<i>Smith, you need to move.</i>
<i>Move now.</i>

939
01:18:50,464 --> 01:18:52,466
<i>We have two 84-millimeter</i>
<i>rocket launchers</i>

940
01:18:52,499 --> 01:18:54,235
<i>ready to fire.</i>

941
01:18:54,268 --> 01:18:55,469
Fuck!

942
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:58,105
Engage the enemy, gentlemen.

943
01:18:58,138 --> 01:18:59,440
Fire!

944
01:19:18,359 --> 01:19:19,827
Hit it.

945
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:23,390
Hold your fucking fire.
I'm coming out.

946
01:20:24,491 --> 01:20:25,826
I'm coming out.

947
01:20:27,995 --> 01:20:30,532
I'm throwing my gun.

948
01:20:30,565 --> 01:20:32,032
We've got him.

949
01:20:43,177 --> 01:20:47,448
Declan McBride, you're not
an easy man to find.

950
01:20:48,949 --> 01:20:51,218
Why don't you show me
them hands, son?

951
01:20:54,689 --> 01:20:57,057
Here's two I prepared earlier.

952
01:20:57,091 --> 01:20:59,893
Shoot me. We'll salute
St. Michael together.

953
01:20:59,927 --> 01:21:02,229
Get on your fucking knees now.

954
01:21:02,262 --> 01:21:05,065
Careful, Ranger.
Put the gun down.

955
01:21:05,999 --> 01:21:07,368
You may be suicidal.

956
01:21:07,401 --> 01:21:09,937
Her? Not so sure.

957
01:21:10,638 --> 01:21:14,041
No matter how far
I have to track you,

958
01:21:14,074 --> 01:21:15,409
whatever it takes,

959
01:21:15,442 --> 01:21:20,615
I guarantee I will not quit
until you're behind bars

960
01:21:20,648 --> 01:21:22,216
or six feet under.

961
01:21:24,017 --> 01:21:25,452
Well, then...

962
01:21:25,486 --> 01:21:27,254
Good luck to you, Ranger.

963
01:21:35,530 --> 01:21:38,098
I repeat, he's on the run.

964
01:21:58,352 --> 01:22:00,154
<i>Lost sight</i>
<i>of McBride, Smith.</i>

965
01:22:00,187 --> 01:22:03,056
<i>Repeat. We do not have</i>
<i>eyes on the target.</i>

966
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:05,392
<i>McBride is Charlie Foxtrot.</i>

967
01:22:12,567 --> 01:22:17,204
<i>Orwell said</i>
<i>that people sleep peaceably</i>
<i>in their beds at night</i>

968
01:22:17,237 --> 01:22:20,974
because rough men, and
in our case, rough women,

969
01:22:21,008 --> 01:22:25,713
stand ready to do violence
on their behalf.

970
01:22:25,747 --> 01:22:29,249
The world owes you both
a great debt of appreciation,

971
01:22:30,117 --> 01:22:33,721
and I want to thank you
on behalf of the agency.

972
01:22:35,489 --> 01:22:38,693
Agent Smith, you'll
return to your unit.

973
01:22:38,726 --> 01:22:42,095
Ranger Tyree, I assume
you'll be leaving us

974
01:22:42,129 --> 01:22:44,298
at your earliest convenience.

975
01:22:44,331 --> 01:22:46,568
Well, I am, and I will.

976
01:22:47,769 --> 01:22:49,336
Happy trails.

977
01:22:49,369 --> 01:22:51,472
I'll be checking my mail.

978
01:22:51,506 --> 01:22:53,675
Seven and three-eighths
cattleman.

979
01:22:53,708 --> 01:22:55,209
You want boots to go with it?

980
01:22:56,243 --> 01:22:57,645
Just the hat, Ranger.

981
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:05,352
You're not going home,
are you, Ranger?

982
01:23:05,385 --> 01:23:06,688
Ah, things...

983
01:23:08,155 --> 01:23:09,524
ain't that simple.

984
01:23:10,758 --> 01:23:13,661
We're done. Good guys won.

985
01:23:14,762 --> 01:23:16,163
Got your payback.

986
01:23:19,433 --> 01:23:22,604
When Ranger Daniels
graduated from the academy,

987
01:23:24,104 --> 01:23:26,406
married his high school
sweetheart.

988
01:23:28,710 --> 01:23:33,013
At their wedding,
I promised her
I'd look out for him.

989
01:23:35,349 --> 01:23:37,251
That promise ended
in the dirt,

990
01:23:38,118 --> 01:23:41,421
side of the road
in Laredo County, so...

991
01:23:44,458 --> 01:23:46,193
I've got to make good on that.

992
01:23:46,226 --> 01:23:47,427
You're going after him?

993
01:23:48,428 --> 01:23:50,364
Don't reckon I have a choice.

994
01:24:37,579 --> 01:24:40,180
The DEA drone
over Sinaloa, Mexico

995
01:24:40,213 --> 01:24:42,850
spotted what they think
is a smuggling outfit

996
01:24:42,884 --> 01:24:44,652
led by McBride.

997
01:24:44,686 --> 01:24:46,286
They have me
deep in another project,

998
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,322
or I would be there with you.

999
01:24:48,355 --> 01:24:50,692
I'll send you all
the information we have.

1000
01:24:50,725 --> 01:24:52,192
Good luck, Alex.

1001
01:26:57,719 --> 01:26:59,286
Ranger Tyree.

1002
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:01,789
You come all the way
down here for me?

1003
01:27:03,791 --> 01:27:05,827
It's the law of the jungle
out here.

1004
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:07,829
You ready to commit
to that, Ranger?

1005
01:27:08,563 --> 01:27:09,764
Get your boots on.

1006
01:27:19,807 --> 01:27:21,475
You gonna kill all of us?

1007
01:27:22,309 --> 01:27:23,878
Well, I'd prefer not to.

1008
01:27:25,445 --> 01:27:27,715
You're all on your lonesome.

1009
01:27:27,749 --> 01:27:30,283
I asked you to get
your boots on.

1010
01:27:31,552 --> 01:27:33,386
Don't make me repeat myself.

1011
01:27:35,388 --> 01:27:36,858
Fine.

1012
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:43,931
That was foolish.

1013
01:29:09,984 --> 01:29:12,385
Agh!

1014
01:29:17,124 --> 01:29:18,726
Don't you have a life, Ranger?

1015
01:29:20,561 --> 01:29:23,496
There's two types
in this game, McBride.

1016
01:29:24,866 --> 01:29:28,035
Those on the run,
and those doing the hunting.

1017
01:29:29,937 --> 01:29:31,706
Dead or alive.

1018
01:29:33,507 --> 01:29:34,809
Your choice.

1019
01:29:42,016 --> 01:29:43,684
I thought so.

1020
01:29:43,718 --> 01:29:47,989
Tie something around that leg.
Use it as a tourniquet.

1021
01:29:48,022 --> 01:29:49,523
It's a long walk.

1022
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,095
You got this covered, Ranger?

1023
01:29:54,128 --> 01:29:55,495
Chief.

1024
01:29:56,063 --> 01:29:59,800
You're gonna find a mess
of deceased smugglers
back yonder.

1025
01:29:59,834 --> 01:30:01,769
Once again,
I'm indebted to you.

1026
01:30:02,236 --> 01:30:04,071
Many people
will not think it so.

1027
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:09,543
I believe a man should always
celebrate a job well done.

1028
01:30:10,011 --> 01:30:11,078
<i>Ciggaro?</i>

1029
01:30:11,112 --> 01:30:13,714
I like your line
of reasoning, chief.

1030
01:30:16,817 --> 01:30:19,687
All right.

1031
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:20,988
It might be
a better arrangement

1032
01:30:21,022 --> 01:30:22,924
to have the Irishman
buried with his mules.

1033
01:30:22,957 --> 01:30:24,692
You know, I'm right here, chief.

1034
01:30:25,425 --> 01:30:28,129
Might just come
to that, Ignacio.

1035
01:30:28,162 --> 01:30:30,965
I might suggest to stay
clear out of Mexico

1036
01:30:30,998 --> 01:30:33,634
for a-- a decade or so.

1037
01:30:53,788 --> 01:30:55,122
Adios, Ranger!

1038
01:30:55,923 --> 01:30:58,225
And that's all
it took to take me down?

1039
01:30:58,259 --> 01:31:00,561
One riot, and one
fucking ranger.

1040
01:31:00,594 --> 01:31:02,129
Just doing my job.
