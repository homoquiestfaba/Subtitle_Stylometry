[crowd cheering]

135
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:24,109
Back in 2019, our rookie season,

136
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,712
We actually had our first ever
<i>battlebots</i> win against end game.

137
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,414
So, this is kinda
full circle for us.

138
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,817
The team is definitely ready to
have three fights in a single day.

139
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:34,319
However, the tournament
is kind of insane

140
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,822
Because all the bots in the
tournament are so destructive.

141
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:39,357
Tombstone, hypershock,
the bots all hit so hard.

142
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:42,494
The bots, all have the
ability to fully retire our robot.

143
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:43,995
Luckily, we did
bring a lot of spare,

144
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,097
So hopefully we'll be ready for
each match that we have to fight.

145
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,400
But it's a big deal.

146
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:50,535
So, we're playing ribbot
in our first fight today.

147
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,404
And they're modular
robots, they could be running

148
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:54,272
A horizontal spinner
or a vertical spinner.

149
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,141
We know what we want 'em to play

150
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,144
And we have kind of a back
up plan for if we're not sure.

151
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:01,613
It's really important for
us to win this golden bolt.

152
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:05,050
I think we've got the best
robot in the world right now,

153
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,352

opportunity to show it.

<i>End game is
smashing and crashing</i>

189
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:04,502
<i>And perhaps dashing the
hope of ribbot here tonight.</i>

190
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:07,105
[kenny] <i>yeah, ribbot alread
having issues and of course</i>

<i>Because once again, they're
just not looking to win one fight,</i>

195
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,620
<i>They're looking to
win three tonight.</i>

196

00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,790

- [referee] five.

[buzzer sounds]

201
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:41,305
[chris] <i>wow!</i>

202
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,947
<i>Well, tough day at the
offic when your head lands</i>

203
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:52,050
<i>Five feet from your
body after a collision.</i>

204
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,319
[kenny] <i>yeah, end game
just kinda stalked them,</i>

205
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:57,522
<i>Like a great white shark,
just bit down right on ribbot,</i>

206
00:10:57,524 --> 00:11:01,026
<i>Sent him flying, you see
th weapon belt came off of</i>

207
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:03,828
<i>That undercutter of
ribbot immediately.</i>

208
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,664
<i>David jin, perhaps
regretting that</i>

209
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:08,533
<i>Configuration choice
right about now.</i>

210
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,201
[chris] <i>well, we now,
few drivers are more</i>

<i>Aggressive when they smell
weakness than jack barker.</i>

212
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,740
<i>Got the frog in
the short corner.</i>

213
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:16,941
<i>That was it.</i>

214
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,911
<i>Time to back up. Give
'em one more shot.</i>

215
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:23,048
<i>And end game's
moving on to the semis.</i>

216
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:26,951
All right.

217
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:30,422
Nick mabey, jack
barker, congratulations.

218
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:32,857
- Wow!
- Thank you, thank you.

219
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,694
Got another one of these.

220
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,562
Hey, jack.

221
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:39,864
Were you a little ticked
off that ribbot came out

222
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,399
With the shades on their frog

223
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,635
And they were trying to
get under your skin a bit?

224
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:45,214
Well, last time they
came out with the shades,

225
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:46,705
They absolutely
kicked our butts.

226
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,306
So, we just needed to
make sure that, you know,

227
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:49,373
We keep the shades

228
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,943
And just smash them
up even after the fight.

229
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:56,147
Yeah, that fight went pretty
differently from last time.

230
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,950
You guys came out with
those forks and then you didn't.

231
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,351
Talk about that a little bit.

232
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,021
So, like, we know
what they can do.

233
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,757
They can either be
a vert or a horizontal,

234
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,058
So we went for the wedges.

235
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,404
But if they were
gonna go for the vert,

236
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,328
We put on a little contingency.

237
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,198
And, you know, we saw that
they were running the horizontal,

238
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,033
So we don't need those
anymore, we'll get rid of them.

239
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:17,213
And just gonna give them away
and they're gonna count for damage,

240
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,104
So we'll smash 'em up
before the fight starts.

241
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:22,307
[kenny] had fun watching
you play chess out there.

242
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:24,409
All right guys, congratulations.

243
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,944
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

244
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,512
[jin] nick! Nick!

245
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,648
One to one.

246
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,417
- One to one?
- One to one.

247
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,624
[chris] <i>so, the former
champ end game</i>

248
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:42,427

<i>They have a come an awfully
long way the past few years</i>

254
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,041
<i>But end game was just
too much for them tonight.</i>

255
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:59,010
[kenny] <i>yeah, no doubt
we'll see this squad back</i>

256

<i>With an even stronger ribbo</i>

00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,947

Up next, we got

<i>And let's start with

276
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,834
<i>Hypershock was out of this world</i>

[exclaims]

[kenny] <i>yeah, the amount

absolutely insane.</i>

284
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,719
<i>Everything is clicking
for hypershock right now.</i>

285
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,821
<i>And in a very short

00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:24,062
But it's a tough
draw for 'em tonight

289
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,598
Because in their two
matchups with skorpios,

290
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,499
They have dropped both of them.

291
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,179
[kenny] <i>yes, zach

<i>And it was designed to defen

opportunity for granted.</i>

338
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:31,322
[crowd cheering]

339
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,528
So, originally when
I got hypershock,

340
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,964
I was like, "dude, I've
already done this twice.

341
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,100
The fans aren't
gonna wanna see this."

342
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,502
But then I watched his
footage from this season

343
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,504
And, oh, my god!

344
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,106
Will finally fixed it.

345
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:51,175
This is not the same
hypershock I have fought.

346
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,012
And I'm gonna need
a few new tactics.

347
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,514
My big goal is to
get him upside down.

348
00:16:56,516 --> 00:17:00,318
And I'm hoping if I just fling
myself into the blade long enough,

349
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,120
He'll flip over, I'll flip over.

350
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:04,155
The difference is
I can get back up.

351
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:07,225
They're the best wedge in
the competition, bar none.

352
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:10,328
They have the best, you
know, ground game upfront.

353
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,596
You know, in terms of armor,

354
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:14,098
They always have little
attachments to put on.

355
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,701
We will not get under it,
at least not from the front,

356
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,263
So I have to do a very good job

357
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,303
Of being incredibly patient

358
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:20,938
In getting our
forks under his side.

359
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,808
Or under the back or
under a wheel or something.

360
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,688
But that's the only
way we can deliver a hit

361
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:26,832
And that's what we gotta do.

362
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,219
[crowd cheering]

363
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:43,828

367
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:59,644

Almost flipped out of the box.</i>

368
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,113
<i>It's over!</i>

369
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:03,448
<i>It's over!</i>

- Six, five.
- [chris] <i>you broke it, will</i>

373
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:15,026
- You broke it.
- Four, three, two, one.

374
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:16,627
[buzzer sounds]

375
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,963
[chris] <i>24 seconds.</i>

377
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:25,403
<i>Wow!</i>

378
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:32,043
<i>24 seconds, kenny florian.</i>

379
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:34,645
[kenny] <i>yeah, I think the ke
was those forks on the front</i>

380
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:37,515
<i>Hypershock was able to
get underneath repeatedly.</i>

381
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,750
<i>Speed, power, aggression,</i>

382
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:43,421
<i>This was no fluke,
this was domination.</i>

383
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:45,356
[chris] <i>boy, it was three shots,</i>

384
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:48,259
<i>Then finished the
blue monst for the night.</i>

385
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:52,130
<i>As hypershock is moving on I
the tournament of champions</i>

386
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:55,800
[laughs]

387
00:18:55,802 --> 00:19:00,004
[crowd] hypershock!
Hypershock! Hypershock!

388
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:01,739
[chris] <i>will bales.</i>

389
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,010
This place is jumping. I
don't know if you can hear me,

390
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:09,313
But this place went
nuts on that shot.

391
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:10,715
Yeah.

392
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:12,416
[crowd cheering]

393
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:17,221
I was not aware
scorpions could fly too.

394
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,556
[all chuckling]

395
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,359
I'm frankly a bit surprised
that we got under the front

396
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,094
And got those hits in.

397
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,429
They are the definition
of floor scraping

398
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:29,233
And perfect front end,
so must be a lucky shot.

399
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:31,402
-And then we bent it up...
-[person in crowd] I love you, will!

400
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:33,337
Thank you.

401
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:37,942
So, I'm really sorry about
picking this particular door,

402
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:39,784
It's like the door to
throw people out in,

403
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,379
It's a nice door.

404
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,415
You've become the
<i>battlebots</i> bouncer.

405
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:47,318
Congratulations, thanks for
throwing everybody out of the club.

406
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,619
You're out of here!

407
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,023
- Great run so far.
- Thanks, guys.

408
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,865
We'll see you in the
next round hypershock.

409
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:04,335
<i>So, skorpios falls
in dramatic fashion.</i>

410
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:08,005
<i>And it's yet another victim

<i>Hypershock, kenny.</i>

412
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,976
[kenny] <i>yeah, this
marks five straight wins.</i>

413
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:14,212
<i>All of them violent
and dominant, chris.</i>

414
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:17,315
<i>Hypershock could very
well b the last one standing</i>

415
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,350
<i>When all is said
and done tonight.</i>

416
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,819
[chris] <i>what an
unbelievable run.</i>

417
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:24,622
<i>Hypershock moving
on to the second round.</i>

418
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,325
<i>All right, coming up,</i>

419
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:29,460
<i>Is there a doctor in the house?</i>

420
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,429
<i>Can andrea and mike gellatl</i>

421
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:36,000
<i>Put an end to kyle miller's
miraculous 7-0 career start</i>

422
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:38,236
<i>It's witch doctor facing glitch.</i>

423
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:41,005
<i>The golden bolt
tournament continues</i>

424
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,607
<i>Next!</i>

[crowd cheering]

426
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:54,719
[chris] we continue
on. It is the chase for

427
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:57,555
The golden bolt at
the end of the night.

428
00:20:57,657 --> 00:21:00,057
<i>We just saw team
hypershock advance</i>

429
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,827
<i>To the second round
in convincing fashion.</i>

430
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:04,762
<i>And we caught up
with captain will bales</i>

431
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:08,499
<i>After his knockout
victory over skorpios.</i>

432
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:10,735
Win number five in a
row. It's feeling good.

433
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:11,936
Feeling good.

434
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,804
That was much quicker
than we anticipated it to be.

435
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:16,707
But once again, not a scratch.

436
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:20,111
Not a single blemish on the top
armor or the side armor or anything.

437
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,412
It's just the weirdest event.

438
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:25,516
We've gone five for five
now with some serious robots.

439
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:28,819
And no one has
damaged any armor.

440
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:30,521
No one.

441
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:32,657
So, who's gonna do it?

442
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:38,663
[chris] <i>another flawless
victory from team hypershock</i>

443
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:41,499
[kenny] <i>yeah, the run they'r

00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:43,668
<i>Will bales is a
man on a mission.</i>

445
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:46,003
<i>The rest of the bracket
better watch out.</i>

446
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,041
[chris] <i>and it continues on
with witch doctor and glitc</i>

447
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:51,353
<i>And if I had told
you an year ago</i>

448
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:52,810
<i>That glitch would have
been in this tournament,</i>

449
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,379
<i>You would have
said, "who's glitch?</i>

450
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:57,014
<i>- I don't know who they are?</i>
- [kenny chuckles]

451
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:59,717
[chris] <i>they were a
rookie bot in 2021.</i>

452
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:02,053
<i>They went 3-0 during
the regular season.</i>

453
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:05,056
Was the number nine
overall seed in the round of 32,

454
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,326
<i>But because of mechanical
issues could not answer the bell.</i>

455
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,961
<i>And they were forced to
bow out of the tournament</i>

456
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,129
<i>So, you know what?</i>

457
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:14,298
<i>They entered the
golden bolt qualifier,</i>

458
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,800
<i>They ran through that.</i>

459
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:17,802
<i>Dismantled the
legend in rotator,</i>

460
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:20,004
<i>Like we have never seen before.</i>

461
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,806
<i>And believe it or not, this crew</i>

462
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:23,206
<i>Of young college students</i>

463
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:28,579
<i>Now sit at 7-0 lifetime
in their</i> battlebots <i>caree</i>

464
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:31,015
Yeah, this team is
easily the biggest surprise

465
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:33,150
In 2021 and here as well.

466
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:34,979
<i>It hasn't been the
smoothest journey.</i>

467
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:39,056
<i>They've battled significant
mobility issues inside the box.</i>

468
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:40,902
<i>But there's something
about this bot's</i>

469
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,661
<i>Unorthodox, low profile desi</i>

470
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:45,963
<i>That has left its
opponents dumb founded</i>

471
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,465
<i>As to how to attack it.</i>

472
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,300
<i>And to say glitch's
weapon hits hard,</i>

473
00:22:49,302 --> 00:22:52,203
<i>Well, that would be a
serious understatement.</i>

474

<i>Mike has avoided

<i>For fear of them
inhibiting his driving.</i>

515
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:45,316
<i>But glitch is so low to
the ground on all sides</i>

516

<i>The team feels it

517

way to catch an edge</i>

This little rider
is ready for war,

521
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:05,503
It's glitch!

<i>From the university

<i>And that deadly
egg beater spinner</i>

00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:19,783
<i>That has shocked
the world, glitch!</i>

527
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,620
<i>They may keep their
run alive, kenny florian.</i>

[kenny] <i>listen, I think
kyle miller would tell you,</i>

529
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:25,956
<i>He's as surprised as anyone</i>

<i>To be sporting a
7-0 lifetime record.</i>

531
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:30,561
<i>But facing witch doctor,</i>

532
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,664
<i>He understands the
symbolism of this match</i>

533
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:35,699
<i>What I'm looking
for is whether or not</i>

534
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:38,536
<i>The team has addressed
glitch's mobility issues.</i>

535
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:40,804
<i>There is very
little room for error</i>

536
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:44,208
<i>Against a driver as
skilled as mike gellatly.</i>

[crowd cheering]

538
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,817
Their weapon is looking,
like, very powerful,

539
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:56,820
But they seem to have
pretty unreliable drive.

540
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:59,623
But the people that
have lost to glitch,

541
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,125
Drive straight
into their weapon.

542
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:02,826
We are gonna be very patient.

543
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:05,095
I know it's only three minutes
and it feels like an eternity,

544
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:07,898
But we're gonna make them
engage us if that's what it takes.

545
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,400
If you don't move,
you get counted out,

546
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:10,801
So we're gonna take our time

547
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,703
And make sure that
we land the hit we need.

548
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:15,806
We're doing our best that we
can to get our drive working.

549
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:18,108
Not really been the
case in a lot of fights,

550
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,610
But we really need it.

551
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:22,613
We're gonna do our best to keep
our weapons pointed towards them

552
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:24,548
And try to hit them
whenever we can.

553
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,750
It's kind of a chance to prove

554
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:29,753
That we could have gone
farther in the round of 32.

555
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:32,323
That we would have had a
great fight against witch doctor.

556
00:26:32,325 --> 00:26:33,724
And we could have beat them.

557
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:35,259
So, this one's personal for us

558
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:37,127
And we really
wanna take 'em down.

moving much better</i>

<i>Than we're used to
seeing to start this match,</i>

640
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:09,940
<i>Ditching those front forks.</i>

<i>Looks like it
was the right call.</i>

642

<i>May have missed a few
opportunities to attack</i>

forks got hung up</i>

<i>On the box floor though.</i>

00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:20,517
<i>Eventually, witch
doctor found an opening.</i>

00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,019
[chris] <i>yeah, glitch
did a good job</i>

647
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:24,121
<i>Of staying squared
up to the veteran.</i>

648
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:27,558
<i>But mike gellatly, dude
is so patient and surgical,</i>

649
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:29,660
<i>Landed a shot to
the side of glitch.</i>

650

[kenny] <i>no doubt. I thought
mike made the right choice</i>

652

<i>In continuing to attack glitch.</i>

653
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:38,402
<i>Once he had it
against the screws,</i>

654
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:41,505
<i>You cannot afford to give
a bot as powerful as glitch</i>

655
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:42,840
<i>A second chance.</i>

- Hi.
- Hi.

661
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,453
- Hey.
- Congratulations.

662
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,355
- Thank you.
- What was the idea behind

663
00:30:58,424 --> 00:31:01,425
Being so patient
there at the beginning?

664
00:31:01,427 --> 00:31:05,062
So, I mean, glitch is a
very innovative robot.

665
00:31:05,064 --> 00:31:06,741
They have this really
cool driver where they can

666
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:08,932
Translate and drive around.

667
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:11,101
They're 7-0 I
think at this point,

668
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:14,304
So we did not wanna drive
right into their weapon, obviously.

669
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:17,541
They had huge,
huge hits this year.

670
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,087
And it looks like they
actually were driving

671
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:20,510
Super well in this match.

672
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:22,312
Better than they have
in any other match,

673
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:25,082
So we weren't sure how
well they'd be able to translate.

674
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:28,018
And I knew I needed to
stay out of the path of that

675
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,120
Monstrous weapon.

676
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:33,156
Mike, you went with the
forks configuration there.

677
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,125
- Finally.
- Are you happy you did that? Yeah.

678
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:36,426
Satisfied?

679
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:39,830
Yeah, I mean, we got
hung up in some of the

680
00:31:39,832 --> 00:31:42,132
Saw slots a few times there.

681
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:45,335
But glitch is so low, you know,

682
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,504
We figured this is like
the perfect opportunity

683
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:50,307
To use 'em and I think
they worked pretty all right.

684
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:53,010
Andrea and mike gellatly, team
witch doctor, congratulations.

685
00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:55,512
We'll see you in the
semi-finals against hypershock.

686

<i>With the reigning

718
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:30,941
And what an amazing season
for the brand new co-captains,

719
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:33,377
Alex grant and ginger schmidt.

720
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:36,747
<i>They led the little puncher

721
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:39,750

<i>But kenny, all the
way back in 2018,</i>

724

<i>Tantrum faced tombstone
during its rookie season</i>

725
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:49,693
<i>And let's just say
it was memorable,</i>

726
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:52,162
<i>But for all the wrong reason</i>

727
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:54,998
[kenny] <i>yeah, tombstone
not only knocked tantrum out,</i>

728
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,533
<i>It ripped its fists off</i>

729
00:33:56,602 --> 00:33:59,202
<i>And embedded
it in the battle box.</i>

730
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,038
<i>Alex and ginger told
us the whole thing</i>

731
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,506
<i>Was a little embarrassing</i>

732
00:34:02,508 --> 00:34:04,541
<i>And that they've been
waiting for a rematch</i>

733
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,576
<i>With ray billings ever since</i>

734
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:08,859
[chris] <i>well, they're
finall gonna get it tonight,</i>

735
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:11,748
<i>But much like this is
a vast different tantrum</i>

736
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:13,850
<i>Than the last time
these two fought,</i>

737
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,919
<i>We may now be talking
about a different version</i>

738
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:18,221
<i>Of tombstone as well.</i>

739
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,656
<i>Dare I say</i>

740
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:22,904
That tombstone has a little
something to prove to everyone tonight.

741
00:34:22,928 --> 00:34:24,327
I think they do.

742
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:27,564
<i>Ray billings is obviously a
legend and a former champion</i>

743
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:30,600
<i>But tombstone 5-5
in its last ten fights</i>

744
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:33,603
<i>And the</i> battlebots <i>worl
is starting to openly wonde</i>

745
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:36,206
<i>If the king of kinetic
energy still has it.</i>

746
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:39,776
<i>Ray's made some significant changes
to the weapon in the past few years,</i>

747
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:42,212
<i>Searching for even
more knockout power.</i>

748
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:44,614
<i>I think that has led to
some inconsistency,</i>

749
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:48,118
<i>But this is still one of th
hardest hitting robots in the world.</i>

750
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,420
<i>I think that beefy
armor on tantrum</i>

751
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:51,655
<i>Will be tested.</i>

752
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:56,460
Ray billing says don't
underestimate us.

753
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:58,962
Everybody should
still be afraid.

754
00:34:59,031 --> 00:35:01,131
Let's see for ourselves. Faruq.

He likes his pizza with
pepperoni, pineapple

758

And the blood of his victims.

Pineapple. [retches]

<i>How have they setup tantrum to face
a bot as powerful as tombstone, kenny?</i>

782
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:37,260
[kenny] <i>such a durable
robot this thing is a little tank</i>

783
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:38,628
<i>You see that front wedge there,</i>

784
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,330
<i>That was designed specifical</i>

785
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:42,432
<i>To defend against
horizontal spinners.</i>

786
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:45,635
<i>They wanna use it to
jam up tombstone's blade,</i>

787
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:49,039
<i>Then drop it into
attack mod with their fist,</i>

788
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,041
<i>That sliding vertical disc spin.</i>

789
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,955
I believe that I can
beat them in this match.

790
00:37:04,957 --> 00:37:06,723
We're gonna be hitting
'em a little harder than

791
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,526
They've been hit up
to this point in time.

792
00:37:09,528 --> 00:37:12,062
He'll have some sort of big
steel arrangement on the front

793
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,430
To try to stop the spinner,

794
00:37:13,432 --> 00:37:17,400
So he can corner me and
get his weapon into play.

795
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:20,437
So, my strategy is gonna
be I'm gonna have to try to get

796
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:23,406
Away from the arena
wall as quickly as possible

797
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,343
And try to just keep fighting
in the center of the arena.

798
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,012
'cause if he gets me pushed into
a corner, I'm gonna be in trouble.

799
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:31,781
It's gonna be a great tough
match between two champions

800
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:33,316
And I'm looking forward
to getting in the arena

801
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,252
And doing our thing.

802
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:39,222
I think this is a sort
of an inflection point

803
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:40,957
For tantrum

804
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:43,059
To prove that we are part
of the big leagues now.

805
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:45,228
Tantrum is not who we
were three seasons ago

806
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,963
When we first fought tombstone.

807
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:48,798
And this is really,
the difference in fight,

808
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,501
I think will show the
world how far we've come.

809
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:55,405
To prepare tombstone, we added
some gruff bars to the front of our robot.

810
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:59,209
Gruff bars are what
we call really strong

811
00:37:59,211 --> 00:38:01,411
Steel bars that
we add to the front,

812
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:03,913
So that we can knock
tombstone's blade in half.

813
00:38:08,387 --> 00:38:10,820
All right, we got this.
Let's go, tantrum.

<i>And tombstone
with kinetic energy</i>

839
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:03,800
<i>Wielding it all
over the box. Wow!</i>

<i>Trying to avoid the rails.</i>

850
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:26,723
[kenny] <i>well, this is where
needs to shut down that weapon.</i>

851
00:40:26,725 --> 00:40:28,858
<i>It looks like he's
having an issue with it.</i>

852
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,627
[chris] <i>yeah, it is
pointing right at us.</i>

853
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:32,228
<i>Tantrum hanging back.</i>

854
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,830
<i>Watching, waiting to see</i>

855
00:40:33,832 --> 00:40:36,499
<i>If the king of kinetic
energ destroys itself.</i>

856
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:38,601
<i>That blade is still spinning</i>

857
00:40:40,005 --> 00:40:42,105
<i>Oh, my goodness!</i>

858
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:43,740
<i>Oh!</i>

859
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:45,708
[kenny] <i>I'm not seeing
a lot of control here.</i>

860
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,110
[chris] <i>tombstone is smoking</i>

861
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:50,847
<i>Tantrum is taking the
2016 champ into the rails.</i>

00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,849
<i>The weapon is no
longer functioning.</i>

863
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:57,120
And ray billings is in a
world of trouble now, kenny.

864
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:59,122
[kenny] <i>yeah, tombstone
is hurt badly, chris.</i>

865
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:00,924
<i>Just crab walking now.</i>

866
00:41:00,926 --> 00:41:03,226
<i>Ray is gonna run
out of rope here.</i>

years watching tombstone</i>

<i>The hardest shots in the gam</i>

875

<i>But tantrum can
certainly take a punch.</i>

876
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:42,198
[kenny] <i>my goodness, it's ju so
difficult to knock this robot out.</i>

877
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,801
<i>Combine that with well
executed game plans</i>

878
00:41:44,803 --> 00:41:46,402
<i>And world class driving,</i>

879
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:49,305
<i>That's why tantrum is
your reigning champ.</i>

880
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:51,908
[chris] <i>able to deflect
tombstone's energy here</i>

881
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,744
<i>And send it
careening out of control</i>

882
00:41:54,813 --> 00:41:57,780
<i>And that spelled disaster
in the short corner.</i>

883
00:41:57,782 --> 00:42:01,117
<i>Yeah, we had a front row
sea as tombstone's blade</i>

884
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,354
<i>Slammed against the
rails and the battle box floor.</i>

885
00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:06,055
<i>That damaged the drive</i>

886
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:08,057
<i>And eventually,
blew out the weapon.</i>

887
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:09,292
<i>Tough night for ray billings</i>

888
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:10,960
[chris] <i>tantrum
hanging back saying,</i>

889
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:14,964
<i>"we're all grown up now, ray</i>
we don't shine shoes anymore."

890
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:21,704
Alex and ginger,

891
00:42:22,507 --> 00:42:25,208
What a run tantrum has been on.

892
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,442
It is a run.

893
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:28,344
You win the giant nut.

894
00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:32,048
You take down a
legend in tombstone.

895
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,017
What is going on here, ginger?

896
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:37,820
I mean, in tantrum's
first season,

897
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:40,723
We had to actually go
up against tombstone

898
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:43,059
And we were
hobbling into that fight.

899
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:46,062
I mean, I think we only had
half of our drive train working.

900
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,430
It was a rough year for us.

901
00:42:47,432 --> 00:42:49,399
So, to be able to come back now

902
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:51,401
And be able to
take tombstone out,

903
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:53,336
I mean, it is an
incredible feeling.

904
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:54,537
Honestly, it's amazing.

905
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,440
[all applauding]

906
00:42:57,509 --> 00:42:59,142
Well, guys, congratulations.

907
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,411
We will see you
in the semi-final

908
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:03,680
In the chase for the
golden bolt. Congrats.

909
00:43:03,682 --> 00:43:04,814
Thank you.

910
00:43:04,816 --> 00:43:07,517
[crowd cheering]

911
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:12,322
[chris] so, as team tantrum
heads back to the pits

912
00:43:12,324 --> 00:43:13,964
<i>To prepare for their next match,</i>

913
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,526
<i>Let's take a step back.</i>

914
00:43:16,528 --> 00:43:19,062
It's been a while since
ray billings has really left

915
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,096
His stamp on the sport,

916
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:22,098
- The way that he wants to.
- Right.

917
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,601
[chris] <i>can the legend find
a way to turn things around</i>

918
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:26,002
<i>And return to form</i>

919
00:43:26,004 --> 00:43:29,105
<i>At the upcoming world
championship and beyond.</i>

920
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,607
[kenny] <i>listen, we've
said it a lot lately,</i>

921
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:32,508
<i>The sport is evolving so fas</i>

922
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,210
<i>And getting younger every year.</i>

923
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:37,914
<i>Tombstone isn't anywhere
nea as dominant as it used to be</i>

924
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:40,283
<i>But the fans want to see th
grim reaper back in the box</i>

925
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:43,453
<i>And I have faith, ray
will d what he needs to do</i>

926
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:45,254
<i>To answer the bell.</i>

927
00:43:45,323 --> 00:43:46,923
[chris] <i>all right, and with that</i>

928
00:43:46,925 --> 00:43:48,958
<i>Our first round
action is complete</i>

929
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,628
<i>And we are down to
just four contenders.</i>

930
00:43:52,697 --> 00:43:55,465
<i>And check out this
quartet of killers.</i>

931
00:43:55,533 --> 00:43:59,202
<i>2020 giant nut winner,

932

<i>With reigning</i> battlebots

933
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,740
<i>And coming up,</i>

934
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:06,209
<i>Two ferocious vertical spinners,</i>

935
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:08,011
<i>The red hot hypershock</i>

936
00:44:08,013 --> 00:44:11,714
<i>Will collide with two-time
runner up, witch doctor.</i>

937
00:44:11,716 --> 00:44:14,317
<i>The golden bolt
tournament continues</i>

938
00:44:14,953 --> 00:44:16,052
<i>Next.</i>

939
00:44:24,963 --> 00:44:27,296
We are back on
<i>battlebots champions,</i>

940
00:44:27,298 --> 00:44:29,699
The chase for the golden bolt.

941
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:32,335
<i>It is time for our first
semi-final between</i>

942
00:44:32,404 --> 00:44:34,937
<i>Hypershock and witch doctor</i>

943
00:44:34,939 --> 00:44:37,340
<i>This is a dream matchup.</i>

944
00:44:37,442 --> 00:44:39,642
<i>On one hand,
you have will bales,</i>

945
00:44:39,744 --> 00:44:41,611
<i>Who electrifies the crowds.</i>

946
00:44:41,613 --> 00:44:43,813
<i>He's captained hypershock
through one of the most</i>

947
00:44:43,815 --> 00:44:47,417
<i>Insanely destructive winnin
streaks in recent memory.</i>

948
00:44:47,419 --> 00:44:48,918
<i>Then there's witch doctor,</i>

949
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,720
<i>Perennially in its prime.</i>

950
00:44:50,722 --> 00:44:54,157
<i>Captained by the iconic duo
of andrea and mike gellatly</i>

951
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:57,627
<i>These two squads actually
share a shop together in florida,</i>

952
00:44:57,629 --> 00:45:00,563
<i>So they're very familiar
with each other, kenny.</i>

953
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:04,300
And now, they're gonna
destroy each other. I love it.

954
00:45:04,302 --> 00:45:06,803
<i>You know, witch doctor
obviously has the pedigree</i>

955
00:45:06,805 --> 00:45:10,807
<i>And they had no problems earlier
with the rookie juggernaut, glitch.</i>

956
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:13,643
<i>But no one has been
as hot as hypershock</i>

957
00:45:13,745 --> 00:45:15,211
<i>Throughout this tournament.</i>

958
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:17,714
<i>In the first round they had
skorpios out of the arena</i>

959
00:45:17,716 --> 00:45:19,215
<i>In ten seconds flat.</i>

960
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:21,284
Will bales has been
a man on a mission.

961
00:45:21,286 --> 00:45:24,120
<i>This is a kind of fight you
pay good money to see.</i>

962
00:45:25,123 --> 00:45:26,923
[chris] <i>and now,
one of these bots</i>

963
00:45:26,925 --> 00:45:31,227
<i>Is just two wins away from
hoisting the golden bolt.</i>

964
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:33,930
Let's find out who's punching
their ticket to the final.

965
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:34,964
Faruq!

She'll make you feel bad as hell

00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,407
Like lizzo in reverse.

970
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:46,409
She'll make your death a reality

971
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:48,444
And you know that truth hurts.

972
00:45:48,513 --> 00:45:49,912
Blame it on her juice,

973
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:52,148
So speedy when
she throws the switch,

974
00:45:52,217 --> 00:45:53,916
Just took a dna test,

975
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:57,253
Turns out she's 100
percent that witch.

976
00:45:57,322 --> 00:46:00,156
It's witch doctor!

00:47:28,313 --> 00:47:32,181
<i>I suppose you can never have
too much paleo in your pit crew.</i>

1006
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:34,217
[kenny] <i>never. And
unlike witch doctor,</i>

1007
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:37,820
<i>It looks like they're sticki with
their fork configuratio for this one.</i>

1008
00:47:37,822 --> 00:47:41,057
<i>Worked pretty well against
skorpios earlier tonight.</i>

1009
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:44,327
<i>We'll see whose ground game
strategy pays off in this fight.</i>

1010
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:49,999
Hypershock!

1011
00:47:50,001 --> 00:47:52,001
[crowd cheering]

1012
00:47:57,108 --> 00:47:59,642
Hypershock is like one
of the fastest robots here.

1013
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:01,511
Will's one of the
best drivers here.

1014
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,079
But we're hoping
he'll make a mistake,

1015
00:48:03,081 --> 00:48:04,747
You know, he's overconfident.

1016
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:09,318
- [chuckles] will bales?
- Yeah, he's pretty much the epitome of overconfidence.

1017
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,655
Hypershock's gotten some
huge ko hits and so have we.

1018
00:48:12,757 --> 00:48:15,124
So, it's going to be a huge
slugfest between two robots.

1019
00:48:15,126 --> 00:48:16,659
It might not be a long fight,

1020
00:48:16,761 --> 00:48:19,629
But there's guarantee
there'll be some crazy air-time.

1021
00:48:19,631 --> 00:48:21,230
We have these rally long forks

1022
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:25,034
And we spent the whole
off-season complaining with them

1023
00:48:25,136 --> 00:48:27,303
About how wedge
lids are killing the sport

1024
00:48:27,305 --> 00:48:29,038
And forks are killing the sport

1025
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,007
And they made some
little ones, I'm like,

1026
00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:32,708
"rats, I need to make some too."

1027
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:36,612
And we threw them on and
they've been working like a charm.

1028
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:38,514
So, guess what
you're getting mike?

1029
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:39,715
It's going to be a
heck of a match.

1030
00:48:39,717 --> 00:48:42,318
My goal is to set
a high fast paced,

1031
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,220
You know, event here.

1032
00:48:44,222 --> 00:48:47,023
And do a good, solid
drifting clinic on 'em.

hypershock actually</i>

1135

<i>Helped witch doctor
out by dislodging that tire.</i>

1136

<i>And allowing witch doctor's

[chris] <i>big credit to hypershock</i>

<i>Staying squared up

1139
00:53:33,744 --> 00:53:35,945
<i>Even landing this massive shot,</i>

<i>But mike gellatly managed t
create the opening he needed</i>

1141

[kenny] <i>mike started drivin circles
around his hobbled opponent.</i>

1142

<i>And then, here
the finishing shot</i>

1143
00:53:45,523 --> 00:53:47,323
<i>Right near the upper deck.</i>

1144
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:50,025
<i>Hypershock gave
an all-out effort.</i>

1145
00:53:50,027 --> 00:53:52,127
But put 'em in the body bag.

1146
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,033
Andrea!

1147
00:53:58,035 --> 00:54:00,536
What was it like watching
your husband run roughshod

1148
00:54:00,605 --> 00:54:04,039
Over your good friend,
will bales and hypershock?

1149
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:07,009
I have to tell you, we did not think
that match was gonna go that way.

1150
00:54:07,011 --> 00:54:09,111
Witch doctor has
had so much damage.

1151
00:54:09,113 --> 00:54:10,613
We did not know
how it was going to go.

1152
00:54:10,615 --> 00:54:13,048
And will bales is
an incredible driver.

1153
00:54:13,117 --> 00:54:14,817
His robot's so fast.

1154
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:18,120
I think we shocked ourselves
as much as anybody else.

1155
00:54:18,122 --> 00:54:20,033
- Hyper shocked, you could say.
- Hyper shocked.

1156
00:54:20,057 --> 00:54:21,690
[mike chuckles]

1157
00:54:21,692 --> 00:54:23,125
It was a crazy fight.

1158
00:54:23,127 --> 00:54:25,261
At one point, you
took one of his tires off.

1159
00:54:25,329 --> 00:54:26,962
It actually got stuck.

1160
00:54:27,031 --> 00:54:29,098
It was jamming up
your primary weapon.

1161
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,033
How nervous were
you guys at that point?

1162
00:54:31,135 --> 00:54:32,935
Well, I was trying to
dislodge it with the weapon,

1163
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:35,782
But the weapon's spins in a
direction that lodges it further up,

1164
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:37,740
So mike was trying
with the self-righter.

1165
00:54:37,808 --> 00:54:39,119
We talked about
going to the hammer

1166
00:54:39,143 --> 00:54:40,809
And try to see if the
hammer could get it out.

1167
00:54:40,811 --> 00:54:43,412
But just hitting him, he
took it out for us, I think.

1168
00:54:43,414 --> 00:54:45,147
[all chuckling]

1169
00:54:45,249 --> 00:54:46,215
Congratulations.

1170
00:54:46,217 --> 00:54:48,751
We'll see you in the
final of the golden bolt.

1171
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:50,019
Thank you.

1172
00:54:52,923 --> 00:54:54,823
[chris] <i>hey, will.</i>

1173
00:54:54,825 --> 00:54:58,027
<i>How discouraging was it whe
they popped your wheel off?</i>

1174
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:01,030
I'm fine.

1175
00:55:01,032 --> 00:55:03,799
You know, I'm happy someone
finally gave us some damage

1176
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:04,900
In this competition.

1177
00:55:04,902 --> 00:55:06,702
- We went...
- [crowd booing]

1178
00:55:07,738 --> 00:55:10,105
Hold on! Hold on! You boo.

1179
00:55:10,107 --> 00:55:13,442
We went all the way here
without anyone touching

1180
00:55:13,544 --> 00:55:16,045
The side armor,
the top, the bottom,

1181
00:55:16,047 --> 00:55:17,346
The back, anything.

1182
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:20,049
They did! They
deserve it! They won it!

1183
00:55:20,051 --> 00:55:22,151
[all applauding]

1184
00:55:23,954 --> 00:55:25,053
[chris] <i>love to hear that.</i>

1185
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:28,057
An amazing run by you
and your entire team.

1186
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:29,958
- Congratulations, will.
- Thanks, guys.

1187
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,361
[all applauding]

1188
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:41,603
[chris] <i>so, witch doctor's
moving on to the finals.</i>

1189
00:55:41,605 --> 00:55:43,405
<i>Familiar territory for them</i>

1190
00:55:43,407 --> 00:55:45,541
<i>But I think the story
coming out of this fight</i>

1191
00:55:45,609 --> 00:55:48,110
<i>Is the recent success
of team hypershock.</i>

1192
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:50,112
I applaud all of them.

1193
00:55:50,114 --> 00:55:52,948
I'm so happy for will
bales and his team.

1194
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,950
<i>Their performance
throughou this tournament</i>

1195
00:55:54,952 --> 00:55:56,719
<i>Is the stuff of legend.</i>

1196
00:55:56,721 --> 00:56:00,289
<i>I can't wait to see if they can
recapture this magic next season</i>

1197
00:56:00,291 --> 00:56:03,125
<i>And finally make a
run at the giant nut.</i>

1198
00:56:03,127 --> 00:56:06,128
[chris] <i>all right, coming up
it's the semi-final matchup</i>

1199
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:08,630
<i>Between the two most
recent world champions,</i>

1200
00:56:08,632 --> 00:56:10,632
<i>End game and tantrum.</i>

1201
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:14,036
<i>And on that note, it's
gonn take a herculean effort</i>

1202
00:56:14,138 --> 00:56:17,039
<i>Not just in the battle
box, but in the pits as well</i>

1203
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:19,141
<i>For one of these
bots to triumph.</i>

1204
00:56:19,243 --> 00:56:21,343
<i>And no team
understands that more</i>

1205
00:56:21,412 --> 00:56:23,512
<i>Than the 2021 world champs,</i>

1206
00:56:23,514 --> 00:56:27,416
<i>Ginger schmidt, alex
grant and team tantrum.</i>

1207
00:56:28,452 --> 00:56:30,297
We just got out of our
fight with tombstone,

1208
00:56:30,321 --> 00:56:32,121
We took some really
massive hits from them.

1209
00:56:32,123 --> 00:56:33,956
We got a really fast turnaround.

1210
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:36,058
We took massive
hits, you can see here,

1211
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,427
Chunks of our armor
completely missing.

1212
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:40,496
And our weapon
is also not spinning.

1213
00:56:40,498 --> 00:56:41,530
So, we don't know why.

1214
00:56:41,532 --> 00:56:42,798
We're gonna take it
all apart and look at it.

1215
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,733
But we can't waste
a single minute.

1216
00:56:56,313 --> 00:56:58,847
[chris] we continue on with
the tournament of champions,

1217
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,716
The chase for the golden bolt,

1218
00:57:00,718 --> 00:57:05,154
<i>The semi-finals between the
last two winners of the giant nut.</i>

1219
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,056
<i>We got the 2021
champion, tantrum</i>

1220
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:11,727
<i>Taking on the 2020
champion end game.</i>

1221
00:57:11,729 --> 00:57:13,862
<i>And let's start with
the bo co-captained by</i>

1222
00:57:13,964 --> 00:57:15,998
<i>Ginger schmidt and alex gran</i>

1223
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,299
<i>We said it earlier tonight,</i>

1224
00:57:17,301 --> 00:57:19,935
<i>This tournament
is a war of attrition.</i>

1225
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:22,237
<i>Kenny, tantrum is a bot
that can take a beating</i>

1226
00:57:22,339 --> 00:57:23,772
<i>And keep on ticking.</i>

1227
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:25,418
[kenny] <i>yeah, I mean,
the first thing I think of</i>

1228
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,809
Is they are unkillable.

1229
00:57:26,811 --> 00:57:28,710
Doesn't matter what
you throw at them,

1230
00:57:28,712 --> 00:57:31,313
They find a way to
survive, keep going.

1231
00:57:31,315 --> 00:57:33,293
[chris] <i>remember,
back in the semi-finals</i>

1232
00:57:33,317 --> 00:57:35,417
<i>Of the 2020
championship tournament,</i>

1233
00:57:35,419 --> 00:57:38,220
<i>Tantrum was flipped by
end game and counted out.</i>

1234
00:57:38,222 --> 00:57:40,155
<i>They've since
added a self-righter,</i>

1235
00:57:40,224 --> 00:57:42,624
<i>So they're not gonna
make anything easy</i>

1236
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:44,860
<i>For the former world
champs this time around.</i>

1237
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:47,863
Did you say that
tantrum's unkillable?

1238
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:50,399
Because I think that jack
barker and nick mabey,

1239
00:57:50,401 --> 00:57:51,533
<i>The co-captains of end game</i>

1240
00:57:51,602 --> 00:57:53,442
<i>Their ears kinda
perked up a little bit</i>

1241
00:57:53,504 --> 00:57:54,848
<i>'cause they're
like, "wait a second.</i>

1242
00:57:54,872 --> 00:57:57,739
<i>We got a great weapon
that c kill just about anything."</i>

1243
00:57:57,841 --> 00:58:00,620
- Including your dreams, kenny florian if it must.
- [kenny laughs]

1244
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:01,910
How's it gonna do
against tantrum?

1245
00:58:01,912 --> 00:58:03,752
Well, what's the key
here for end game?

1246
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:05,692
Well, listen, if there's
one weapon out there

1247
00:58:05,716 --> 00:58:08,016
That can do some
serious damage to tantrum,

1248
00:58:08,018 --> 00:58:09,718
<i>It's probably end game.</i>

1249
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,020
<i>You know, if it wasn't
for a vintage performance</i>

1250
00:58:12,022 --> 00:58:14,056
<i>From daniel freitas
and minotaur,</i>

1251
00:58:14,058 --> 00:58:16,258
<i>We could very well be
talking about end game</i>

1252
00:58:16,293 --> 00:58:18,227
<i>As a back-to-back champ.</i>

1253
00:58:18,229 --> 00:58:21,330
<i>It is still at the top of the
food chain and believe m</i>

1254
00:58:21,332 --> 00:58:24,399
<i>They are already envisionin
a championship battle</i>

1255
00:58:24,401 --> 00:58:25,534
<i>With witch doctor.</i>

1256
00:58:27,037 --> 00:58:28,804
Somebody's moving
on to the finals.

1257
00:58:28,806 --> 00:58:30,939
Let's find out which bot it is.

1258
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:32,808
Faruq, take it away.

1259
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:34,610
[crowd cheering]

1260
00:58:37,948 --> 00:58:40,215
In the red square,

1261
00:58:40,217 --> 00:58:41,683
Play this game of death

1262
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:43,519
And you'll get
popped in the chops.

1263
00:58:43,521 --> 00:58:45,554
He throws hands like bruce lee

1264
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:47,856
And his fists of
fury don't stop.

1265
00:58:47,925 --> 00:58:49,691
Jeet kune don't test him

1266
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:51,426
Because he's earned his clout

1267
00:58:51,428 --> 00:58:53,128
And when he enters the box,

1268
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:55,163
They'll be dragging you out.

1269
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:57,699
It's tantrum!

1270
00:58:57,701 --> 00:58:59,701

1271
00:59:01,405 --> 00:59:04,406
[chris] <i>in a year we all agr
featured the highest level</i>

1272

<i>Of collective talent in
the history of the sport</i>

1273
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:09,711
<i>It was tantrum who climbed
to the top of the mountain</i>

1274
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:11,813
<i>And took home the giant nut</i>

1275
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:15,317
<i>What would it mean for them to
also bring home the golden bolt?</i>

1276
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:16,618
[kenny] <i>oh, my goodness.</i>

1277
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:19,755
<i>I mean, they would definitel
go into that upper echelon</i>

1278
00:59:19,823 --> 00:59:22,291
<i>Of legendary robot teams.</i>

1279
00:59:22,293 --> 00:59:25,427
<i>Just really, wow with what
they've been able to do here</i>

1280
00:59:25,429 --> 00:59:28,430
<i>They're going with their arm
design for vertical spinners</i>

1281
00:59:28,432 --> 00:59:31,300
<i>They used it against
cobalt in the quarterfinals</i>

1282
00:59:31,302 --> 00:59:33,802
<i>Of the 2021
championship tournament,</i>

1283
00:59:33,804 --> 00:59:36,038
<i>Worked out pretty
well for them that night.</i>

1284

<i>We'll see how it handles

<i>End game.</i>

1286
00:59:43,147 --> 00:59:45,113
[faruq] in the blue square,

1287
00:59:45,115 --> 00:59:46,949
Once upon a time in hollywood,

1288
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:48,917
This team won the giant nut.

1289
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:51,720
Now, these natural
born killers are in sin city

1290
00:59:51,722 --> 00:59:53,221
And they're kicking butt.

1291
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:54,957
They were death proof before

1292
00:59:55,025 --> 00:59:57,225
Winning battles
from dusk till dawn,

1293
00:59:57,227 --> 00:59:58,794
Now it's the same story

1294
00:59:58,796 --> 01:00:01,430
Except they're dressed
like the reservoir dogs.

1295
01:00:01,432 --> 01:00:03,699
By the way, did you
know that in new zealand,

1296
01:00:03,701 --> 01:00:06,802
They call the golden
bolt a royale with cheese.

1297
01:00:06,804 --> 01:00:08,103
Pretty crazy, huh?

1298
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:11,173
Give it up for end game!

[chris] <i>the 2020 giant
nut winner, end game,</i>

1301
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:22,818
<i>A true knockout artist</i>

1302
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:25,721
<i>As evidenced by their
first round ko of ribbot.</i>

1303
01:00:25,723 --> 01:00:28,323
<i>This is unquestionably
the most feared robot</i>

1304
01:00:28,325 --> 01:00:29,725
<i>In the sport, kenny.</i>

1305
01:00:29,727 --> 01:00:31,460
<i>So, how's it looking?</i>

1306
01:00:31,495 --> 01:00:33,328
[kenny] <i>well, they're
going with their wedge lit</i>

1307
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:36,398
<i>And fork combination
to try and pop up tantrum.</i>

1308
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,200
<i>When end game
controls the low ground,</i>

1309
01:00:38,202 --> 01:00:39,835
<i>The forecast is deadly</i>

1310
01:00:39,903 --> 01:00:41,663
<i>With a 100 percent
chance of pain.</i>

[crowd cheering]

1312
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:55,817
In our fight against tombstone,

1313
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:58,220
We took some really serious
damage to our weapon.

1314
01:00:58,222 --> 01:00:59,821
Usually, you have a bit of time

1315
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:01,523
To fix the robot in
between matches,

1316
01:01:01,525 --> 01:01:03,558
But we're flying by
the seats of our pants

1317
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,926
Just trying to get
everything working

1318
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:07,963
And we're really hoping
we're kicking at full power

1319
01:01:07,965 --> 01:01:09,264
In the end game match.

1320
01:01:09,266 --> 01:01:12,011
End game is a beast.
We're definitely scared of 'em.

1321
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:14,414
They're a hard hitter and
it's not gonna be an easy fight,

1322
01:01:14,438 --> 01:01:16,204
But we do think
we have a chance.

1323
01:01:16,206 --> 01:01:18,940
We've noticed in the past,
they like to circle their opponents,

1324
01:01:18,942 --> 01:01:20,308
Wait for them to make a mistake

1325
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:22,210
And then get into the side.

1326
01:01:22,212 --> 01:01:24,613
We're gonna make sure
that we don't let that happen.

1327
01:01:24,715 --> 01:01:26,448
We've got a big weapon up front.

1328
01:01:26,517 --> 01:01:28,316
They can't compete
with that with theirs,

1329
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:30,352
So they're not gonna
wanna engage that,

1330
01:01:30,454 --> 01:01:32,120
But we're gonna make sure
that it's always facing them.

1331
01:01:32,122 --> 01:01:35,123
Tantrum won the giant nut
in 2021 and that's awesome.

1332
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:36,625
But they didn't beat
us along the way.

1333
01:01:36,627 --> 01:01:38,505
So, we wanna prove
that if we had their run

1334
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:40,228
And they had to
play us along the way,

1335
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:41,990
Then we would have
an answer to them.

1336
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,233
- [referee] you good?
- Sorry?

1337
01:01:45,302 --> 01:01:46,862
- [referee] you good?
- Yup.

1338
01:01:47,304 --> 01:01:48,804
It's ours.

1339
01:01:57,514 --> 01:02:01,316
[chris] <i>it's a semi-final wa
between battlebots royalty.</i>

1340
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:03,418
<i>Tantrum and end game,</i>

1341
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:06,154
<i>One of these world champs
is gonna move on to the fina</i>

1342
01:02:06,256 --> 01:02:09,124
And battle witch doctor
for the golden bolt.

1343
01:02:09,126 --> 01:02:11,426
[crowd] fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight.

1344
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:16,298
[chris] <i>let the
bot battle begin.</i>

1345
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,800
<i>Tantrum, quick
out of the square.</i>

1346
01:02:18,802 --> 01:02:21,103
<i>End game exposes
its side momentarily.</i>

1347
01:02:21,105 --> 01:02:23,405
<i>Dillon carey unable
to take advantage.</i>

1348
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:25,207
<i>Now the bots locking horns,</i>

1349
01:02:25,209 --> 01:02:27,309
<i>The battle for low
ground begins.</i>

1350
01:02:28,512 --> 01:02:30,256
[kenny] <i>both teams
know from experience</i>

1351
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:33,915
<i>Just how important it is to be
the one that strikes first, chris.</i>

1352
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:36,118
<i>They are jockeying for position.</i>

1353
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,320
[chris] <i>end game
backing tantrum down.</i>

1354
01:02:38,322 --> 01:02:40,522
<i>Who's gonna draw first blood</i>

1355
01:02:40,524 --> 01:02:42,624
<i>Okay, those forks
get untangled now.</i>

1356
01:02:42,693 --> 01:02:43,959
<i>Tantrum resets.</i>

1357
01:02:44,962 --> 01:02:46,228
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

1358
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:49,231
<i>End game gets hung up
on the floor momentarily.</i>

1359
01:02:49,233 --> 01:02:50,699
[kenny] <i>always a risk
when you're running</i>

1360
01:02:50,701 --> 01:02:53,301
<i>Ground scraping
attachments, chris.</i>

1361
01:02:53,303 --> 01:02:56,304
<i>So far both robots
going head-to-head.</i>

1362
01:02:56,306 --> 01:02:59,241
- [all exclaiming] - [chris]
<i>big shot by end gam</i>

1363
01:02:59,309 --> 01:03:00,809
<i>That was a huge shot.</i>

1364
01:03:00,811 --> 01:03:04,146
<i>The pulverizer just
missed tantrum as well.</i>

1365
01:03:04,214 --> 01:03:05,814
[kenny] <i>I think that
was little sneak peek</i>

1366
01:03:05,816 --> 01:03:09,117
<i>Of what end game means.
Clean attack to the sides.</i>

1367
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,318
[chris] <i>quick turnover.</i>

1368
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,220
<i>Tantrum rights itself.</i>

1369
01:03:12,222 --> 01:03:15,457
<i>Trying to get up again
to face end game.</i>

1370
01:03:15,526 --> 01:03:17,959
[kenny] <i>considering tantrum
came into this fight beat up</i>

1371
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:19,761
<i>It's holding up very well.</i>

1372
01:03:19,797 --> 01:03:22,330
- [all exclaiming] -
[chris] <i>oh, nice shot there</i>

1373
01:03:22,332 --> 01:03:24,933
[kenny] <i>tantrum is so well
armored, but end game</i>

1374
01:03:25,002 --> 01:03:27,602
<i>Knocking it around
the battle box right now.</i>

1375
01:03:27,671 --> 01:03:30,939
[chris] <i>yeah, dillon
carey going in for more.</i>

1376
01:03:30,941 --> 01:03:35,844
<i>Kenny, tantrum just cannot g that
disc where it wants to on end game.</i>

1377
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:37,791
[kenny] <i>now, those
forks on end game,</i>

1378
01:03:37,815 --> 01:03:40,916
<i>Those wedgelets are
winning the ground war, so far.</i>

1379
01:03:40,918 --> 01:03:43,351
<i>Oh, nice shot there by end game.</i>

1380
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:47,155
[chris] <i>oh, but the pulveriz
just landed on the 2020 champs.</i>

1381
01:03:47,257 --> 01:03:50,058
[kenny] <i>tantrum's starting t slow
down a bit here, chris it looks like.</i>

1382
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:53,139
[chris] <i>yeah, that punching disc
is starting to lose some steam</i>

1383
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:56,965
<i>And the big shots are starti
to catch up with tantrum.</i>

1384
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:59,100
[kenny] <i>they're gonna need
t find a way to close the gap</i>

1385
01:03:59,102 --> 01:04:01,503
<i>In the damage column, chris</i>

1386
01:04:01,505 --> 01:04:04,439
[chris] <i>whoa, look at
that gyroscopic move.</i>

1387
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:07,409
[kenny] <i>looks like tantrum is
going into tank mode here, chris.</i>

1388
01:04:07,411 --> 01:04:10,846
<i>Their primary weapon is
down they have no choice</i>

1389
01:04:10,914 --> 01:04:13,148
<i>But to try and break
end game's weapon</i>

1390
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:14,382
<i>And even things up.</i>

1391
01:04:14,451 --> 01:04:16,418
[chris] <i>now, end game
loves having its opponent</i>

1392
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:17,819
<i>Right against the rails.</i>

1393
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:20,856
<i>We have bits and pieces
of tantrum on the box.</i>

1394
01:04:20,924 --> 01:04:23,725
<i>We're approaching desperatio
time here for tantrum.</i>

1395
01:04:25,095 --> 01:04:27,829
<i>Under a minute to go, you
can see the killsaw very active.</i>

1396
01:04:27,831 --> 01:04:30,365
[kenny] <i>yeah, both forks
are gone right now, chris.</i>

1397
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,667
<i>This could be
trouble for tantrum.</i>

1398
01:04:32,669 --> 01:04:35,837
-[all exclaiming] -[chris] <i>end
game knows it. They smell a victory.</i>

1399
01:04:35,906 --> 01:04:37,405
<i>Goes in for a shot.</i>

1400
01:04:37,407 --> 01:04:39,341
<i>Try to follow it
up with another.</i>

1401
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:41,176
[kenny] <i>I think one of the
weapon belts just came off</i>

1402
01:04:41,178 --> 01:04:42,544
<i>Of tantrum as well.</i>

1403
01:04:42,646 --> 01:04:45,680
<i>End game scoring some
serious damage here.</i>

1404
01:04:45,682 --> 01:04:46,848
[chris] <i>under 30 to go,</i>

1405
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:49,851
<i>But end game's weapon
right now is down.</i>

1406
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,953
<i>Don't know if that's
by choice or not.</i>

1407
01:04:52,022 --> 01:04:54,122
<i>Looks like it is 'cause
it's back spinning.</i>

1408
01:04:54,124 --> 01:04:56,302
[kenny] <i>chris, nick and
jac are throttling that</i>

1409
01:04:56,326 --> 01:04:59,561
<i>Weapon down as a way of
countering tantrum's strateg</i>

1410
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:02,264
<i>If it's not spinning,
tantrum can't break it.</i>

1411
01:05:02,299 --> 01:05:05,200
<i>And if they can't break it,
they're gonna lose this matc</i>

1412
01:05:05,202 --> 01:05:07,202
[chris] <i>under ten
seconds remaining,</i>

1413
01:05:07,204 --> 01:05:09,671
<i>Which means this one's
gonna go the distance.</i>

1414
01:05:09,673 --> 01:05:12,941
<i>Tantrum, kicking and
scrappi to the bitter end.</i>

1415
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,690
- [buzzer sounds] - [chris]
<i>but that's gonna do it.</i>

1416
01:05:17,047 --> 01:05:18,413
<i>Lot of energy.</i>

1417
01:05:18,982 --> 01:05:20,949
<i>Lot of physicality.</i>

1418
01:05:21,018 --> 01:05:23,251
And a lot of fun.

1419
01:05:23,353 --> 01:05:26,054
<i>So, now this goes to the judges</i>

1420
01:05:26,056 --> 01:05:28,223
<i>For the first time tonight.</i>

1421
01:05:28,225 --> 01:05:31,626
<i>We will see all former</i>
battlebots <i>participants,</i>

1422
01:05:31,695 --> 01:05:34,796
<i>Lisa winter, jason
bardis and derek young.</i>

1423
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:37,265
<i>They are scoring on
an 11 points system.</i>

1424
01:05:37,334 --> 01:05:39,401
<i>Up to five points could
be awarded for damage.</i>

1425
01:05:39,403 --> 01:05:40,602
Three for aggression.

1426
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:42,404
<i>And three for control.</i>

1427
01:05:44,408 --> 01:05:47,842
[chris] <i>kenny, end game got
the first mammoth shot in this one.</i>

1428
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:50,823
[kenny] <i>yeah, they sure did they
were able to get underneath tantrum.</i>

1429
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,514
<i>And if tantrum can't
get underneath you,</i>

1430
01:05:52,516 --> 01:05:53,815
<i>They can't control you.</i>

1431
01:05:53,817 --> 01:05:57,118
<i>That's where tantrum has
defeated all of its opponent</i>

1432
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,687
<i>Is with its control.</i>

1433
01:05:58,689 --> 01:06:01,323
<i>And they just weren't
able to do that here</i>

1434
01:06:01,325 --> 01:06:02,724
<i>Against end game.</i>

1435
01:06:02,726 --> 01:06:05,126
[chris] <i>and how about the
quickness of end game here.</i>

1436
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:07,162
<i>Able to use its
speed and agility</i>

1437
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:09,864
<i>To counter the
lightning fast tantrum.</i>

1438
01:06:09,933 --> 01:06:11,099
[kenny] <i>it's a great point,</i>

1439
01:06:11,101 --> 01:06:13,201
<i>End game quick enough
to get around the sides</i>

1440
01:06:13,203 --> 01:06:15,937
<i>And attack the flanks,
as well as put together</i>

1441
01:06:15,939 --> 01:06:17,806
<i>Those deadly combination sho</i>

1442
01:06:17,808 --> 01:06:21,509
<i>That kept tantrum
off-balanc and scrambling.</i>

1443
01:06:21,511 --> 01:06:23,778
[chris] <i>hey, you said
tantrum was unkillable,</i>

1444
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:25,814
<i>Certainly lived
up to that billing.</i>

1445
01:06:25,816 --> 01:06:28,750
<i>But boy, end game
just too good tonight.</i>

1446
01:06:28,819 --> 01:06:31,686
<i>Even powering down its
weapo in the final seconds</i>

1447
01:06:31,688 --> 01:06:34,055
<i>To avoid unnecessary damage</i>

1448
01:06:34,057 --> 01:06:35,957
<i>What a performance.</i>

1449
01:06:35,959 --> 01:06:37,325
<i>Here's the decision.</i>

1450
01:06:38,829 --> 01:06:40,428
[crowd cheering]

1451
01:06:41,365 --> 01:06:43,965
The results from
the judges are in.

1452
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:51,740
The winner by
unanimous decision is

1453
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,314
<i>End game!</i>

1454
01:06:59,316 --> 01:07:01,349
[crowd cheering]

1455
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:10,925
[chris] jack and nick,

1456
01:07:12,029 --> 01:07:14,062
<i>Congratulations.</i>

1457
01:07:14,164 --> 01:07:16,931
<i>Nick, how did you win
that brutal battle tonight?</i>

1458
01:07:16,933 --> 01:07:18,099
My god.

1459
01:07:18,101 --> 01:07:22,037
We were not expecting
such a, like, brutal fight.

1460
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:24,218
- My heart's pounding still.
- [all chuckling]

1461
01:07:25,308 --> 01:07:28,043
This is a battle of
attrition, guys, as you know.

1462
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:29,611
That was a brutal fight.

1463
01:07:29,613 --> 01:07:31,513
Can you go in there and rebuild?

1464
01:07:32,783 --> 01:07:33,782
We gonna have to.

1465
01:07:33,784 --> 01:07:35,661
There's definitely
some stuff broken, like,

1466
01:07:35,685 --> 01:07:37,245
You've probably damaged us most

1467
01:07:38,021 --> 01:07:39,721
This entire year.

1468
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:43,324
So, we'll check it out and
we'll get back in the box.

1469
01:07:43,326 --> 01:07:46,061
Sounds great. We'll see you in
a little bit against witch doctor.

1470
01:07:46,063 --> 01:07:47,162
Thank you.

1471
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:49,431
[crowd cheering]

1472
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:54,335
[chris] hi, alex and ginger.

1473
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:55,603
- Hi.
- Hello.

1474
01:07:55,605 --> 01:07:59,240
First time that you guys
have lost as co-captains.

1475
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:02,277
Alex, this is weird.

1476
01:08:02,279 --> 01:08:03,912
[alex] it's a little weird but

1477
01:08:03,914 --> 01:08:06,648
To lose to end game,
like, in that sort of a bout.

1478
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:08,817
Like, tantrum just kept kicking.

1479
01:08:08,819 --> 01:08:10,852
Self-righter worked
more than once.

1480
01:08:10,887 --> 01:08:14,022
- [all laughing] -
mind you. Yeah.

1481
01:08:14,024 --> 01:08:17,425
And it's great. I'm
excited. It was a good bout.

1482
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:20,528
Ginger, what was the
difference in that three minutes?

1483
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:22,697
I mean, tantrum
went all the way.

1484
01:08:22,699 --> 01:08:25,033
We were agile, we were
running around the box

1485
01:08:25,135 --> 01:08:27,402
And, you know, we were
even able to control end game

1486
01:08:27,404 --> 01:08:28,603
A little bit towards the end

1487
01:08:28,672 --> 01:08:30,305
When their weapon
was slowing down.

1488
01:08:30,307 --> 01:08:32,407
It's okay. This is
another lesson to us.

1489
01:08:32,409 --> 01:08:35,243
And we're gonna be, you
know, that much better next year.

1490
01:08:35,312 --> 01:08:37,512
Congratulations
on a remarkable run.

1491
01:08:37,514 --> 01:08:38,880
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1492
01:08:38,882 --> 01:08:40,849
[all cheering]

1493
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:47,689
[chris] <i>well, kenny,
before start drooling over</i>

1494
01:08:47,691 --> 01:08:49,057
<i>This finals matchup,</i>

1495
01:08:49,059 --> 01:08:51,860
<i>Let's first say our
farewells to tantrum.</i>

1496
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:54,829
It's alex and ginger's
first loss as co-captains

1497
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:57,165
<i>And this one certainly sting</i>

1498
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,300
<i>But you said it
before the fight,</i>

1499
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:01,936
You cannot kill this bot.

1500
01:09:02,005 --> 01:09:04,706
They can be beat, but
they cannot be killed.

1501
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:06,207
<i>Tantrum is no fluke.</i>

1502
01:09:06,209 --> 01:09:09,677
<i>And they still have the chan
to do what end game couldn't</i>

1503
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:12,247
<i>Win back-to-back-giant nuts</i>

1504
01:09:12,282 --> 01:09:13,548
[chris] <i>all right, folks,</i>

1505
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:16,951
<i>The golden bolt
championshi final is all set.</i>

1506
01:09:16,953 --> 01:09:18,686
<i>When we return,
we're gonna break down</i>

1507
01:09:18,688 --> 01:09:20,922
<i>This unbelievable matchup.</i>

1508
01:09:20,924 --> 01:09:22,223
<i>Will it be end game?</i>

1509
01:09:22,225 --> 01:09:24,926
<i>Who once again takes home
the prestigious hardware.</i>

1510
01:09:24,928 --> 01:09:27,362
<i>Or will witch doctor
finally break on through</i>

1511
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:29,063
<i>And become a champion?</i>

1512
01:09:29,065 --> 01:09:32,033
<i>Who will be the first team
to hoist the golden bolt?</i>

1513
01:09:32,135 --> 01:09:34,302
<i>We will find out next</i>

1514
01:09:34,304 --> 01:09:37,138
<i>On</i> battlebots champions.

1515
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:47,415
[crowd cheering]

1516
01:09:47,417 --> 01:09:49,457
[chris] <i>welcome back
to</i> battlebots champions

1517
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:51,953
<i>Where the conclusion of
the golden bolt tournamen</i>

1518
01:09:51,955 --> 01:09:53,788
<i>Is just minutes away.</i>

1519
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:56,257
<i>This incredible
new one night event</i>

1520
01:09:56,326 --> 01:10:00,695
<i>Has given las vegas the bes
action robot combat has to offer.</i>

1521
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:03,398
<i>And now, it is down
to just two teams</i>

1522
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,133
And they are true legends.

1523
01:10:05,235 --> 01:10:08,102
The 2020 winner
of the giant nut,

1524
01:10:08,104 --> 01:10:10,405
<i>End game is here.</i>

1525
01:10:10,407 --> 01:10:13,308
<i>And they are squaring
off against the runner up</i>

1526
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:16,511
<i>In 2019 and 2021,</i>

1527
01:10:16,513 --> 01:10:18,713
<i>Let's hear it for
witch doctor as well.</i>

1528
01:10:18,782 --> 01:10:20,515
[crowd cheering]

1529
01:10:20,517 --> 01:10:22,617
[chris] <i>now, both these
squads are coming off</i>

1530
01:10:22,619 --> 01:10:24,786
<i>Violent brawls in
the second round.</i>

1531
01:10:24,788 --> 01:10:26,621
<i>And this was the
scene in the pits</i>

1532
01:10:26,623 --> 01:10:28,957
<i>As they scramble
to get their bots ready</i>

1533
01:10:29,025 --> 01:10:30,625
<i>For the golden bolt final.</i>

1534
01:10:31,528 --> 01:10:32,961
It's our third fight of the day.

1535
01:10:32,963 --> 01:10:35,063
It's been a really,
really intense day.

1536
01:10:35,131 --> 01:10:37,365
[mike] <i>our last two fights
have just been insane</i>

1537
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:39,400
<i>With, like, all hands on dec</i>

1538
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:42,036
<i>Working on the robot
we're out of our spares.</i>

1539
01:10:42,038 --> 01:10:44,205
<i>We're putting
spares, spares, spares</i>

1540
01:10:44,207 --> 01:10:46,808
<i>And frankenstein
motors back together</i>

1541
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:48,810
<i>Just to be able to
get to the next fight.</i>

1542
01:10:51,047 --> 01:10:52,247
[nick] <i>this is grueling.</i>

1543
01:10:52,348 --> 01:10:55,316
<i>Like, having three fights
in one day is insane.</i>

1544
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:58,786
<i>Normally we like to spend
a lot of time making sure</i>

1545
01:10:58,788 --> 01:11:00,021
<i>Everything is perfect.</i>

1546
01:11:01,057 --> 01:11:04,225
Right now, we've just
put together what we have.

1547
01:11:04,327 --> 01:11:06,160
<i>And it's gonna have
to be good enough.</i>

1548
01:11:07,631 --> 01:11:09,063
And flipside.

1549
01:11:09,733 --> 01:11:10,733
Nothing.

1550
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:12,300
Still nothing.

1551
01:11:12,302 --> 01:11:14,802
[jack] <i>I guess, tantrum,
we took a lot of damage.</i>

1552
01:11:14,804 --> 01:11:16,337
<i>We kinda smacked them about</i>

1553
01:11:16,339 --> 01:11:18,506
<i>But everytime we hit them,
we take that force back into us.</i>

1554
01:11:18,508 --> 01:11:20,608
So, in that fight,
we sheared the bolts

1555
01:11:20,677 --> 01:11:22,510
That attached the
weapons, the pulley.

1556
01:11:22,512 --> 01:11:24,946
<i>And we also had an issue
with weapon electronics.</i>

1557
01:11:24,948 --> 01:11:27,715
<i>One of our custom
features on our control board</i>

1558
01:11:27,717 --> 01:11:28,783
Has stopped working.

1559
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:29,883
<i>So, we've replaced them.</i>

1560
01:11:29,885 --> 01:11:32,420
We are about to roll into
the box and hopefully,

1561
01:11:32,422 --> 01:11:34,522
Everything goes
right. We have no idea.

1562
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:40,895
[chris] <i>okay, kenny, both teams
dealing with some uncertainty</i>

1563
01:11:40,897 --> 01:11:44,666
<i>At the end of this grueling
push towards the golden bolt</i>

1564
01:11:44,668 --> 01:11:46,601
So, what are you
expecting to see tonight?

1565
01:11:46,603 --> 01:11:48,202
Yeah, absolutely,
just to get here

1566
01:11:48,204 --> 01:11:49,937
Is a huge accomplishment.

1567
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:51,939
<i>And taking a look
at the numbers,</i>

1568
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:55,243
<i>You can see just how
close this matchup really is</i>

1569
01:11:55,345 --> 01:11:56,911
<i>Both bots are quick and agil</i>

1570
01:11:56,913 --> 01:11:59,213
<i>Thanks to their
impressive drive trains.</i>

1571
01:11:59,215 --> 01:12:01,949
<i>And while end game have
significantly lighter armor</i>

1572
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:04,619
<i>Let's talk about where
that weight is distributed.</i>

1573
01:12:04,621 --> 01:12:08,356
<i>Witch doctor carries most of
its ar 500 steel armor up front.</i>

1574
01:12:08,458 --> 01:12:11,025
<i>While end game
spreads its hardox steel</i>

1575
01:12:11,027 --> 01:12:13,795
<i>Out over the entire frame.</i>

1576
01:12:13,797 --> 01:12:15,963
<i>And yes, end game
has the bigger weapon,</i>

1577
01:12:15,965 --> 01:12:18,499
<i>But if these two
discs collide head on</i>

1578
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:22,003
<i>The only thing that's
guaranteed is chaos.</i>

1579
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:25,284
<i>These are two of the heavies
hitters in the history of the sport.</i>

1580
01:12:25,308 --> 01:12:26,308
<i>Buckle up.</i>

1581
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:28,543
[chris] <i>we can't wait.</i>

1582
01:12:28,545 --> 01:12:30,056
Can you show 'em
what they're gonna win?

1583
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,191
- Let's go, muscles. Come on!
- Of course, I have to pick this up.

1584
01:12:32,215 --> 01:12:33,548
Show this thing off.

1585
01:12:33,649 --> 01:12:35,316
- Here we go. Huh?
- Look at that.

1586
01:12:35,318 --> 01:12:38,553
- The first ever.
- [crowd cheering]

1587
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:42,390
[chris] <i>so, let's get to it</i>

1588
01:12:42,392 --> 01:12:44,625
Witch doctor against end game.

1589
01:12:44,627 --> 01:12:46,828
Faruq! It's all yours.

1590
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:49,630
[crowd cheering]

1591
01:12:52,302 --> 01:12:55,203
Ladies and gentlemen,

1592
01:12:55,205 --> 01:12:56,904
Are you ready?

1593
01:12:56,906 --> 01:12:59,140
[crowd cheering]

1594
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:13,121
It's championship
robot fighting time!

1595
01:13:13,123 --> 01:13:15,523
[crowd cheering]

1596
01:13:24,834 --> 01:13:27,034
[faruq] in the red square,

1597
01:13:27,036 --> 01:13:30,605
The winds whip wildly around
this wicked witch of the east.

1598
01:13:30,673 --> 01:13:32,206
There's a big storm coming

1599
01:13:32,208 --> 01:13:34,609
And that's just fine
for this vicious beast.

1600
01:13:34,677 --> 01:13:36,711
Because she's
stronger than a tornado

1601
01:13:36,813 --> 01:13:38,413
And quicker than a twister.

1602
01:13:38,415 --> 01:13:41,115
So, you better show
heart, brains and courage

1603
01:13:41,117 --> 01:13:43,951
Or she'll drop a
house on your sister.

1604
01:13:44,053 --> 01:13:47,855
Dorothy, I don't think we're
in the battle box anymore.

1605
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:51,592
Give it up for witch doctor!

1606
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:53,628
[crowd cheering]

1607
01:13:56,232 --> 01:13:58,699
[chris] <i>what a run
witch doctor has had.</i>

1608
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:01,002
<i>The brutality they've
already faced tonight</i>

1609
01:14:01,004 --> 01:14:03,104
<i>Between glitch and hypershoc</i>

1610
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:05,406
<i>And after falling just
shor of the giant nut</i>

1611
01:14:05,408 --> 01:14:06,674
<i>Last season, kenny,</i>

1612
01:14:06,676 --> 01:14:08,476
<i>I think they're looking at this</i>

1613
01:14:08,478 --> 01:14:10,411
<i>As their championship fight</i>

1614
01:14:11,748 --> 01:14:13,392
[kenny] <i>yeah, I mean,
the giant nut is obviously</i>

1615
01:14:13,416 --> 01:14:15,416
<i>The top of the mountain
here at</i> battlebots.

1616
01:14:15,418 --> 01:14:16,951
<i>But if that's 1a,</i>

1617
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:19,220
<i>This golden bolt trophy is 1</i>

1618
01:14:19,222 --> 01:14:21,233
<i>They ditched the
front fork for this match,</i>

1619
01:14:21,257 --> 01:14:23,224
<i>Meaning mike wants
maximum mobility</i>

1620
01:14:23,226 --> 01:14:26,260
<i>In order to try and get arou
to the flanks of end game.</i>

1621
01:14:32,936 --> 01:14:34,936
[faruq] in the blue square,

1622
01:14:34,938 --> 01:14:38,606
This team of dreamers made
a serious off-season glowup.

1623
01:14:38,608 --> 01:14:40,608
Started dressing extra spiffy,

1624
01:14:40,676 --> 01:14:42,543
While they made robots blowup.

1625
01:14:42,612 --> 01:14:44,412
They're gonna
hoist the golden bolt

1626
01:14:44,414 --> 01:14:46,047
And watch it sparkle.

1627
01:14:46,115 --> 01:14:48,115
Going from suits to royalty,

1628
01:14:48,117 --> 01:14:49,717
Like meghan markle.

1629
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:53,221
It's end game!

1630
01:14:53,223 --> 01:14:55,456
[crowd cheering]

1631
01:14:57,494 --> 01:15:00,561
[chris] <i>end game
made fast work of ribbot</i>

1632
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:02,797
<i>Before going the
full three minutes</i>

1633
01:15:02,799 --> 01:15:05,500
<i>And winning a decision
against tantrum.</i>

1634
01:15:05,502 --> 01:15:07,702
<i>The bot looks
pretty good, kenny.</i>

1635
01:15:07,704 --> 01:15:11,005
[kenny] <i>yeah, but it's what we
can't see right now that matters.</i>

1636
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:13,841
<i>The mechanical attrition
end game is facing</i>

1637
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:15,610
<i>Is the x-factor here.</i>

1638
01:15:15,612 --> 01:15:18,412
<i>They're going with their
wed lifts and forks to the front</i>

1639
01:15:18,414 --> 01:15:20,715
<i>As always nick and
jack believe that they can</i>

1640
01:15:20,783 --> 01:15:22,416
<i>Win the battle for low groun</i>

1641
01:15:22,418 --> 01:15:25,953
<i>That legendary weapon
will b able to finish the job.</i>

1642
01:15:26,789 --> 01:15:29,156
[crowd cheering]

1643
01:15:36,332 --> 01:15:38,666
We already faced end game
once before in the fight card

1644
01:15:38,668 --> 01:15:40,401
And it didn't go our way.

1645
01:15:40,403 --> 01:15:42,203
We're gonna use the
same strategy again

1646
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:44,772
And I think we've
fought a lot of robots now

1647
01:15:44,774 --> 01:15:46,107
That fight the way end game does

1648
01:15:46,109 --> 01:15:48,209
And kinda sits at the
center and aims at you.

1649
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:50,645
We're actually using our
single disc configuration

1650
01:15:50,647 --> 01:15:53,614
That we've been using
these last few fights.

1651
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:56,317
So, which is different than
our first fight against end game,

1652
01:15:56,319 --> 01:15:58,319
So maybe that will
give us an advantage.

1653
01:15:58,321 --> 01:16:00,421
We'll have to see how it goes.

1654
01:16:00,423 --> 01:16:02,056
So, the tantrum fight
was actually really hard.

1655
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:04,225
We lost a couple
of speed controllers,

1656
01:16:04,227 --> 01:16:07,862
So we had to, like, swap
them out with entirely new ones.

1657
01:16:07,931 --> 01:16:10,064
Ones that we actually
haven't run before.

1658
01:16:10,166 --> 01:16:12,233
So, it's a little unknown,

1659
01:16:12,302 --> 01:16:14,135
We're little nervous
about the fight.

1660
01:16:14,203 --> 01:16:16,404
Mike is obviously
a really good driver.

1661
01:16:16,406 --> 01:16:21,309
They made it to the finals of
the 2021 giant nut tournament.

1662
01:16:21,311 --> 01:16:23,377
And, you know, we did beat
them in the qualifying round there.

1663
01:16:23,379 --> 01:16:25,379
I think they're really
on form at the moment.

1664
01:16:25,415 --> 01:16:26,647
Coming through this tournament,

1665
01:16:26,649 --> 01:16:29,050
It's gonna be real hard
to try and avoid his attacks

1666
01:16:29,118 --> 01:16:30,318
And try and get under him.
