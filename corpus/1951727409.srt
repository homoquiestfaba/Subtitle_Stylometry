1
00:01:29,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Here we go.
Come on.

2
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Come on, seven!

3
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What are you doing
at the house of God?

4
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This is where I grew up.
Mott Street.

5
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm Charlie Luciano.
In my neighborhood
there were two dons.

6
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Two bosses, each fightin'
for control of New York.

7
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And sometimes innocent people
got caught in the middle.

8
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I got a right to
drink a glass of wine!

9
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I got a right to find work
that uses my brain!

10
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You clean the fish and the
calamari,just like me!

11
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What are you sayin'?
'Cause I'm a greasy immigrant,
all I can do is clean fish?

12
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That ain't enough, Pop!

13
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Buon giorno.

14
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Che cazzo "buon giorno".
You come in my house, hmm?

15
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You tell the
son of a bitch Faranzano,

16
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
the miserabile bestia.
I give him-

17
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh.
Don Faranzano.

18
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Faranzano.

19
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Faranzano, I no
mean what I say.

20
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You have been very loyal.
Done favors for me.

21
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Always made your
payments on time.

22
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Now, you've stopped paying.
I have to ask myself, ''Why?''

23
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
No, no. Faranzano,
Mia piccola bambina she's sick.

24
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I no have the money.
I no got the money.

25
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Fat pig.

26
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
When I came from Sicily,
you went with me.

27
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Now, you're drifting back
to that fat pig, Masseria.

28
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
- No! Faranzano-
- You are, I see.

29
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
No, no, no.
Tu sei mi padrone- Aaah!

30
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I can't take chances.

31
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
If one man can desert me,
everybody can. Understand?

32
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes.

33
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If you have to sell your
daughter, you will pay!

34
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You have a pretty wife.

35
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Usually, after children,

36
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:53,000
they get fat.

37
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Nice sweet taste.

38
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Disgraziato.!
Get out of my house!

39
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I felt your balls, so I
know why she needs her own.

40
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Figlio mio,
put down the knife.

41
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You'll have your
chance one day.

42
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That was one boss.

43
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Don Faranzano.

44
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Some things change
your life forever.

45
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yeah, I know.
I know. Loyalty.

46
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
My father sweated
blood for him.

47
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The guy with me here
is Frankie Costello.
Loyalty, Frankie, yeah?

48
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He and Joey DeCarlo were
my two best friends.
ThatJoey?

49
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But on these streets
friends were hard to keep.

50
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Don Masseria.!
Don Masseria.!

51
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Lo bisogno, per favore.
Chi e chieste?

52
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Look at this.

53
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Lo bisogno aiuto,
per favore.

54
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Chi e chieste?

55
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
No, don't!

56
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Sono sangue.

57
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Terrible what these
niggers are doin'.

58
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
They come down from Harlem,
kill my own nephew.

59
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Right in front
of my face.

60
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
My son.!

61
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh.!
Oh, no, my God.!

62
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh, my son!

63
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Joey.!

64
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Oh,Joey!

65
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Oh,Joey!
Oh, my God! Oh,Joey!

66
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That was the other boss.

67
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Don Masseria.

68
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Some way, some time,

69
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
no matter how
long it took,

70
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I knew what
I had to do...

71
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
to both bosses.

72
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
He kills his own blood,
you know?

73
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I mean his own nephew.
What kind of man is that, huh?

74
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And on top of that,
he pays some Irish to do it.

75
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Uh! Ah!

76
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The law of the street was:
take or be taken.

77
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Everybody fought everybody.
Irish, Italians, Germans,Jews.

78
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But this was different.
This was that Irishman
who killed Joey.

79
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Beatin'up on some skinny
Jewish kid, Meyer Lansky.

80
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And theJewish kid
wouldn't stay down.

81
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Meyer wouldn't give
no matter how bad he got it.

82
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You had to respect that.

83
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Meyer's big pal
was Benny Siegel.
Leave him alone!

84
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Benny loved a good fight.

85
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Even a bad fight,
but they wouldn't
let him in on this one.

86
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What is it? You in love
with the littleJew boy?
No.

87
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Joey was
a friend of mine!

88
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Meyer.!

89
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What the hell's
everybody looking at?

90
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He just
saved your life.

91
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Come on.

92
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Let's get the
fuck out of here.

93
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So that's how we started.

94
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Two Italians and twoJews.
Funny combination, huh?

95
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Frankie--he liked to worry,
so he paid off the cops.

96
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Benny liked to brawl,
so he was our muscle.

97
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And me and Meyer--
we were both the leader.

98
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
At least it
started out that way.

99
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Just four mugs
off the street.

100
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
At first we were penny-ante,
but together we grew.

101
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Thing that worries me is
things is goin' too good.

102
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Relax.
How can I relax?

103
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
When everything's goin' right,
you know it's gonna go wrong.

104
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
We can't keep operating
like four kids running
around the neighborhood.

105
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That's what I mean.
If we're going to
expand, we need a leader.

106
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And who's that
gonna be, huh?

107
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Tommy's meetin'
us over here.

108
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
After you.
Please,
be my guest.

109
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Thank you.

110
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I got 'em comin'up
right now, sir.

111
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Do like I said
with the kid.
Okay.

112
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What is this, huh?
You'll see.

113
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Charlie, come sta?

114
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
How's everything?
Meyer.
Good to see you.

115
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I got everything ready
for you in the back.

116
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What do you got
to show me, huh?

117
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's a little
experiment.

118
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You asked me a question.
I'm gonna answer it.

119
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Come here.
Yeah.

120
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
He's telling this kid
there's a guy here,

121
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
very powerful, successful,
who's got a job for him.

122
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Easy money.

123
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You got that?
Good, get out of here.

124
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Let's go.

125
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Now he realizes.

126
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Bugsy didn't tell him,
right? Me or you.

127
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Got a job for me?

128
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You just did it, kid.

129
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Get lost.

130
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Now do
you see?

131
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Between you and me,
we're equals.

132
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But other people,
they look to you.

133
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What're you sayin', huh?
I'm your front man?

134
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
No.

135
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
This ain't a con, Charlie.
You're it.

136
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You're the one.

137
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Tommy Reina,
Charlie, Meyer.

138
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Good pal, gonna even
be a better partner.

139
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
From your mouth
to God's ear, hmm?

140
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
He's got a line
on the good stuff.
How good?

141
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Bottle in Bond
Scotch Whiskey.

142
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I got a friend got a boxcar
sittin' on a spur in Philly.

143
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
He wants 3 5 G's.
I only got 1 0.

144
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Ahhh.
Who's this friend?

145
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Arnold Rothstein.

146
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
No disrespect, Tommy.
Why would Rothstein wanna do
business with bums like us?

147
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
'Cause some of us are
Jewish bums. Right?

148
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You'll find out Monday night
when you go to his hotel.

149
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
No one ever
called you all bums.

150
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Come on.

151
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's very
good stuff.

152
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Come on in, fellas.

153
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I want you to meet the genius
who fixed the World Series.

154
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Mr. Arnold Rothstein.

155
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
This here's
Charlie Luciano...

156
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and Meyer Lansky.

157
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Tommy, thanks.
Yeah.

158
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Well, sit down.
Sit down.

159
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Mr. Luciano,

160
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
you're walking
down the street.

161
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Suddenly you realize
you're being followed. It's a hit.

162
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Walking toward you
is a second gunman.

163
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You have time to fire at only
one of them. Which one do--

164
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I don't accept the question.
To live, I gotta kill 'em both.

165
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Next,

166
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
your wife--
I don't have a wife.

167
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
- Why not?
- Emotion is dangerous.

168
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
- Aren't you human?
- Would it help?

169
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Next. I have ships
and distilleries in Scotland.

170
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I need distribution
in New York.

171
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Masseria?
Faranzano?
They'd kill me.

172
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
- I won't?
- You haveJewish partners.

173
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Maybe I kill them too.

174
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You can't afford to.

175
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You're in the squeeze.
Masseria has 700 soldiers.
Faranzano, 600.

176
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Either one realizes you exist,
they squash you like an ant.

177
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Unless I get a
powerful friend, huh?

178
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Exactly.

179
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Next.

180
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What's the
secret of America?

181
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
What's the matter with
this guy? I'm 24 years old--

182
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Money!

183
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Everything is
money, Charlie.

184
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Don't ever forget it.

185
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But you, you'll
never make any money.

186
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:15,000
- Why's that?
- You dress like a schmuck.

187
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Ah-ha.

188
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Let's do
some business.

189
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Check it.

190
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's raining money.

191
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
We got money
to burn, Charlie.

192
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Wanna burn some?
Want to? Want to?

193
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Be my guest.
All right!

194
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Everybody ready?

195
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
The party.
Our first million.

196
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Paisan, you ready
to make some money?
I'm ready.

197
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
- I'm always ready.
-Just don't hog all the broads.

198
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I can't help it.
They're all over me.

199
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Tell us something
we don't know, huh?
Gentlemen,

200
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
before we go,
let's have a toast.

201
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Our first
million dollars.

202
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Say this bottle is bootleg
business, greater New York.

203
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
This is our business
when we started.

204
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Nobody noticed us,
nobody gave a shit.

205
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Now this is our
business right now.

206
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's big enough for
us to have a party.

207
00:16:48,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Big enough for
other people to notice.

208
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
This is where we want
our business to be.

209
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But the bigger we get,

210
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
the more we're taking
from other people.

211
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Thanks.
Masseria's
already calling us.

212
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Faranzano, calling.

213
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You see what I'm saying?
Yeah. I didn't
get no whiskey.

214
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm saying this.

215
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:37,000
If we're
not careful--

216
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Charlie.!
Hey.

217
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I got the room
in the back for ya's.

218
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Father,
how are you?

219
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Tommy, you bum,
you look beautiful.

220
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:01,000
How you doin'?
Good to see you.

221
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The table looks beautiful.

222
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Hey!
Giovanni!

223
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
People will love
to play numbers.

224
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's smart business. Somebody
hits big, you gotta publicize.

225
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
All right. I'll get
somebody downtown.

226
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Excuse me,
gentlemen.

227
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Anna Citron,
these are my partners.

228
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Frank Costello.
Hello.

229
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Benny Siegel.
Hi.

230
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And um, these are
their girlfriends.

231
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
He has
two girlfriends?
At least.

232
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Salute.

233
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Charlie, this is my girl.

234
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I want you to meet
Anna Citron.

235
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
My goodness,
I'm honored.

236
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Sit down.

237
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You met my priest?
Anna Citron, this is Meyer Lansky.
Hello.

238
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
This here is
Father Bonotto.
Buona sera, signorina.

239
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Buona sera.

240
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Father!
Ah, Tommy, you stupid
bootlegger from the Bronx.

241
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Charlie,
I want to talk to you.

242
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You see, this is why
alcohol is outlawed.

243
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You son of a bitches, uh?

244
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
They're
threatening us.
Then talk
to the bosses.

245
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You mean buy
ourselves some time.
Exactly.

246
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I agree.

247
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Hey, Frankie.
We made it.

248
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Let me tell you this.
Watch your back, all right?

249
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Good.
Yeah.

250
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So,

251
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
you talked
to Rothstein?
Yeah.
He worries too much.

252
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
So do I.

253
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Faranzano wants to
meet in the morning.

254
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I think
we should go.
Not yet.
Let him beg.

255
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
[ Meyer ]
He is begging.

256
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Aaah!

257
00:20:46,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Meyer!

258
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Aaah!

259
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Move! Move!

260
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You okay, Meyer?

261
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Anna?
Yeah.

262
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
- That's twice I saved your life.
- You're telling me.

263
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I hate owing somebody.

264
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Listen, we're meeting
Faranzano in the morning.

265
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Whatever you say,Meyer.
Good.

266
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You all right,
Anna?

267
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Don Faranzano.

268
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Have we met?

269
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Maybe around
the neighborhood.

270
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
When I
was a kid.

271
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
This is my associate,
Meyer Lansky.

272
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I don't talk
business with Jews.

273
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You talk business with me.
If Meyer works with me,
that ain't your concern.

274
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Let's be blunt.

275
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
If you go with Masseria,
maybe he wins.

276
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
If you go with me,
maybe I win.

277
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
This seems to give you
a lot of power.

278
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So what're you
offering me?

279
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Masseria's the boss of
all bosses. I respect him.

280
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
He's a fat pig.

281
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I offer you this.

282
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Join my family.
We combine all operations.

283
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You'll get
1 5 percent.

284
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yes?

285
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Well, it's a very
handsome offer.

286
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
We have to
think it over.
That means no.

287
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Means what it means. We have
to talk with our partners.

288
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Show them out.

289
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Fifteen percent, huh?

290
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You know how much
money that is?

291
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Well, I don't,
and neither do you.

292
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
But it's a hell of a lot.

293
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Fifteen percent?

294
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
As soon as we sold to Faranzano,
he'd knock you off.

295
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Why would
he do that?
You're Sicilian.

296
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
One day you
might wanna be boss.

297
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
If he iced you now,
there would be a stink,

298
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
but if you're workin' for him,
who's gonna come after him?

299
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Who is gonna give
a fucking shit, except us.

300
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And we'd be history.

301
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
He's right, Charlie.

302
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:06,000
That's why we're in partnership
with theseJews, Frankie.

303
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Excuse me.

304
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
How're you, Charlie?
Right this way.

305
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Show Mr. Luciano his table.

306
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Hey, Charlie!

307
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Nice to see ya.
Good to see you.

308
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I heard you told
Faranzano to go fly.

309
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I told him
I'd think it over.
Always so polite?

310
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Now you come to
seeJoe, the boss?

311
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It's a very smart move, Charlie.
Everybody needs protection.

312
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Even me.

313
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Where is he?
He's up in
his balcony.

314
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You oughta come
aboard, Charlie.

315
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
We're just one big pasta-eatin'
family over here. All right.

316
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I'll see
you later.
All right.

317
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Hi.

318
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Hi.

319
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Geez.

320
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I don't believe my eyes.

321
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It's me.
Hey, Charlie!
Come on, sit down.

322
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I send messages, send flowers
and you don't come to see me.

323
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I had some things I had to
straighten out with Faranzano.

324
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I heard. You won't marry him--
that's beautiful.

325
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Still, you won't go to bed with me,
and I'm so gorgeous.

326
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I know. I've always held
a warm spot for you,Joe.

327
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Your nephewJoey
was a friend of mine.

328
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It's too bad,
Charlie.

329
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Charlie,
you belong in this family.

330
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Someday I will
join you,Joe.

331
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
- You don't like today?
- No. No, I don't like it.

332
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It's too bad, Charlie.
I've seen a lot come and go.

333
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Guys just like you.

334
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
The ones who come,
they come to me.
The ones who go--

335
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I'm the guy
who sends them off.

336
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Hey, you want
a little broccoli?

337
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
- No. No, thank you.
- Come on, it's full of garlic.

338
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
It looks wonderful, but I
gotta get back downstairs.

339
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Enjoy the show.

340
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
What do you think?
I don't trust him.

341
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You don't trust anybody.
I doubt that you trust me.

342
00:27:02,000 --> 00:28:15,000
He's stringing
us along.
Yeah.

343
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Hi.

344
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
You boys enjoy the show?
Park it here,
baby.

345
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
How're you doin'?

346
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Great. Couldn't be better.
Got a light?

347
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:42,000
A light? For you,
I'd burn down this whole joint.

348
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Excuse me,Joe. I hate to interrupt,
but can I talk to my sister?

349
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
This is your sister?

350
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Yeah. Go ahead.
Be my guest.

351
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
It's nothin'.
Just relax. Whoa!

352
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Thanks.
No problem.

353
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It's not really my
favorite part the job.
I could see that.

354
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It's a nice-nice outfit.
Thanks.

355
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
What's your name?

356
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Mara Motes. Somebody said
you're Charlie Luciano.

357
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Let's just say I'm somebody
who believes in his friends.

358
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Good.

359
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Maybe you and I can
be friends sometime.

360
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Yeah. Yeah. I could pick you
up after the show if you like.

361
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
You sure you
wanna do that?

362
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,000
If you want
to be somebody's friend,
it takes time, doesn't it?

363
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I guess it does.

364
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I should
really get back.

365
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Okay.

366
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Bye.

367
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Bye.

368
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Friends, huh?

369
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Yeah?
Charlie, it's Meyer.
We got hit.

370
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
We got no shipment
New Year's Eve.

371
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
We gotta see Rothstein.
Right.

372
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Now.!

373
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
We're supposed to meet
Mr. Rothstein.

374
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Yes.
Of course.

375
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Hey, you know
where to find me.

376
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm Benny Siegel.
You heard of me?
No, not really.

377
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:15,000
What do you do?
I kill people.

378
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Who hit us?
Masseria or Faranzano?
Probably Masseria.

379
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
But who knows?
Could be either one.

380
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I'm the first guy
to worry,

381
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
but doesn't
everybody get hijacked.

382
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
You think this was
business as usual?

383
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I shouldn't have to
explain this to you!

384
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Next week, our customers will
be buying our scotch from them.

385
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
In a month, I'll lose my distillers
toJoseph fucking Kennedy.

386
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And we'll all be
out of business!

387
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
We gotta get tough.
Yeah!

388
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Only, we can't
afford a war.

389
00:31:58,000 --> 00:33:08,000
They got armies;
we don't.

390
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Happy New Year,
honey.

391
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Balls and brains. You got 'em,
you don't need an army.

392
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
A hundred years ago,

393
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Austria was run by
a prince named Metternich.

394
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Austria was weak,
its neighbors strong,

395
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
but Metternich was
a cold, calculating fox.

396
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
If one country
got too strong,

397
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
he organized
an alliance against it.

398
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
He would bring Europe
to the brink of war,

399
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
then everybody thanked him
when he kept war from happening.

400
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
He barely
had an army?

401
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
But he had Europe
by the kishkes.

402
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
We gotta send a signal.
Nobody messes with our stuff.

403
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
We have a shipment landing.
Cape May, tomorrow night.

404
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:46,000
This is a perfect
opportunity to set a trap.

405
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Aaah! Aaah!

406
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Cowards!

407
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Try this again,
I will kill your mothers,

408
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
fuck your sisters and turn
your brothers into eunuchs.

409
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I think you've made your
point, Benny. Let's go.

410
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Tony No Nose. Well, well,
this is a surprise.

411
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Give our regards
to Don Faranzano.

412
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Who's next?

413
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
You wanna
start a war?
I don't mind.

414
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Well, I do. Sometimes you're
so stupid I can't stand it.

415
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Let's go.
Move it. Move it.

416
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I knew it. You had to
kill him, didn't you?

417
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
In 2 4 hours,
Faranzano comes after us.
So?

418
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
So? We can't fight him.
We ain't got the guns.

419
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Masseria does.
Masseria?

420
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
We're goin'
with Masseria?

421
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
He ain't so bad.

422
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
He's a fat, stupid fuck!

423
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Other than that,
I guess he's swell.

424
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Frankie, right now, this fat
stupid fuck can save our lives.
Remember, it's only temporary.

425
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
A few more stupid moves
like that, they'll knock
us over like bowling pins.

426
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
It's time to play
with the big boys.

427
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Yeah, I used to be
skinny like you.

428
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Hey, pay attention!

429
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I'm talkin'
for a reason here.

430
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I used to move fast,
jump fast, dodge bullets.

431
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Fourteen! Fourteen
with my name on it.

432
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Yet, never a scratch
on this beautiful body.

433
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
So I realized,
hey, I can't be hit.

434
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,000
So, why be skinny? Eat!
That's what we are here for.

435
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,000
- What are you here for?
- I wanna talk details.

436
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Yeah, I hear
you got some trouble, huh?

437
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
You hear wrong.

438
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I hear you gotta join my family
to stay alive another 2 4 hours.

439
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I don't deal
from weakness.
Hey.!

440
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
You sit down.

441
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I like you...

442
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
up to a point.

443
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,000
What are the details?

444
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I'm number two, above everybody.
Including Catania here.

445
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
We get a fair piece
of all the action,

446
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
and everything from me and my
associates goes into the pot.

447
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Everything.

448
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Except whiskey. The booze
stays with us and Rothstein.

449
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,000
So, my family
shares in everything,

450
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
except--

451
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
The whiskey, huh?

452
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Right.

453
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
You suckin' bastard!

454
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:06,000
You son of a
flea-bitten bitch!

455
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Thank God
I can't kill him now.

456
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
He made such a tough deal.
He's no phony.

457
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:20,000
You and me together,
Faranzano is a dead man.

458
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
In six months,

459
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
you pass
the whiskey to me,

460
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:38,000
or I kill you.

461
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
You're part
of the family.

462
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Ah, that's my boy.

463
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
It's not a question of numbers.
Anyone can rack up numbers.

464
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
It's how you do it.
It's a question of style.

465
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I don't kill
with style?
You don't know
how to kill at all.

466
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Gentlemen, sit down.

467
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Very interesting to
see you again, Mr. Coll.

468
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Again?

469
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
About three years ago, you
ambushed me and Meyer here.

470
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Oh, yeah.

471
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:36,000
By the old way
of doing things, I should let
Benny shoot you in the head now.

472
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
But I'm not
gonna do that.

473
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
So, you're not
gonna kill me.

474
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
So?

475
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:53,000
- So, we have a problem.
- Name him. He's dead!

476
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Our problem is you.
See, you freelance.

477
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
When you hit people on
our turf, it upsets the cops.

478
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
No!

479
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Plus, you're very,
very good at what you do.

480
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I figure, I upset somebody else,
you don't miss a second time.

481
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
That's my motto.

482
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Nothing so pretty as the
back of a man's head, huh?

483
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
What, you want Mad Dog
to go back to sellin' argyles?

484
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
No, we want Mad Dog...

485
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
to move
his operations out west.

486
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Los Angeles,
San Francisco.

487
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
We promise to keep
you very, very busy.

488
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Out west?

489
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I'll think about it.

490
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I'll let you know.

491
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Gentlemen.

492
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Maybe we should
just kill him.
No. He could
be useful.

493
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Let's just see if he
leaves town. Okay?

494
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Yeah.

495
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Yeah, sure.

496
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Gloria.!
Hi!

497
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Hey, Mara.

498
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Yeah?
Could you come out
here for a minute?

499
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Sure.

500
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Hi.

501
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Let's go upstairs.

502
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Gambling doesn't start
till midnight. Okay?
Okay.

503
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Come on.

504
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Ah, I'm sorry I haven't been
in to see you. I had business.

505
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't?

506
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
No. I knew you'd be back.
You believe in fate?

507
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I don't know.
I do.

508
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Some people are born to be
chorus girls and dog catchers,

509
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
and other people,
people like you,

510
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
have something they
don't even realize.

511
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
What don't
I realize?

512
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I can't tell.
Wouldn't be fair.

513
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
There's another kind of fate.
Between two people.

514
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I mean,
why did I meet you?

515
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
You're very gentle,
you know that?
I am?

516
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Very.

517
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Most guys, tell 'em you want
to be friends and they skip town.

518
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
But you really can,
can't you?

519
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Can what?
Be my friend.

520
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I'd like to be.

521
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I gotta ask you a question.
Not that I'm complaining,

522
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
but if we're gonna be friends,
why did you kiss me?

523
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:44,000
If somebody's your friend,
you can trust them, right?

524
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
With anything?
Yeah.

525
00:44:48,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Yeah.

526
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Do me a favor?
I would do
anything for you.

527
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Don't forget
we're friends.

528
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Once you throw
sex into the kitty,
guys forget their manners.

529
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I won't
forget mine.

530
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Or they start getting all
goo-goo and talking about love.

531
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Love is a very confusing thing
which I personally do not understand.

532
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Well,
neither do I.

533
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Can we
do this again?
I gotta go to work.

534
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I don't mean right now,
I mean, um--

535
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Sure. I can do it as often
as you can. Probably more.

536
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I'm sure.

537
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I'll see
you later.
Okay.

538
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Don't fall asleep.

539
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I won't.

540
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Hey,
how's it going?

541
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Lansky's inside.
He is?

542
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Hey.

543
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
What're you doin'?

544
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Drinkin'.

545
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Straight?
Yeah.

546
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Beauty.

547
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I got a serious
question for you.

548
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Ask away.

549
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
You wanna
sleep with Anna?

550
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
What?
My girl, Anna.

551
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I'm offering
her to you.

552
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
She's...
very beautiful, Meyer.

553
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I happen
to think this.

554
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
But she's
not my type.

555
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,000
She's not your type?
Why isn't she your type?

556
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Because she's
your type.

557
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
You're turning
down this offer?

558
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
That's right.

559
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I'm marrying her next week.
Or month.

560
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
We're not gonna rush it.
But I'm gonna marry her.

561
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Congratulations.

562
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Maybe you'll stop with all
these ridiculous questions.

563
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Friendships, Charlie,
they never get tested.

564
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:33,000
You and me, if we're gonna
stay in this business,

565
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:42,000
we gotta know we
can trust each other.

566
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
So you're, uh,
you're getting married?

567
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
There's this
Yiddish expression:

568
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:54,000
"A wedding is like a funeral,
but with musicians."

569
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
The reception...

570
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
should be an excellent
business opportunity.

571
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Meyer, what, uh, what if
I'd said yes about Anna?

572
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Oh, that you wanted
to shtup her?

573
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Yeah. What if
I'd said that?

574
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
- I would've killed you.
- You would've tried to kill me.

575
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Oh, no.
I would've done it.

576
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
All right.
Let's just say...

577
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,000
for friendship's sake
that we're both equally strong.

578
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
And we both
would've died.

579
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Okay, for
friendship's sake,

580
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I'll-I'll say this.

581
00:50:36,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Even if
it ain't true.
[ Thunderclap ]

582
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Smile.

583
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Oh, God.

584
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I'm gonna get sick
from this goddamn wine.

585
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Why don't we get some Corvo
or something like that?

586
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Excuse me,
Mr. Siegel.

587
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Have you met my daughter,
Rachel?
No, I haven't.

588
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
She was voted the
prettiest girl in school.

589
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Very pretty.
She's not a
bad cook, either.

590
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Oooh,
that's important.

591
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
They got those things
called ''kreplach.''

592
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
That's like ravioli.
And they got this thing...

593
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
called a ''blintz.''
It's like manicotti.

594
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I love manicotti.
Yeah, right here.

595
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Then they got that.
That's matzo balls.

596
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
It's like a big hunk
of soggy bread.

597
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Oh, God, that
looks like brains.
Yes.

598
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Oh, no, I don't want that.
Charlie?

599
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
How's family business?

600
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
It's up 3 5 percent
since I came on.

601
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Ahh, that's good.

602
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
See if you can get
someone to get me...

603
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:23,000
some of that, uh,
ravioli crap.
I got some.

604
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Prohibition... ain't
gonna last forever.
Yes.

605
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
We're gonna go with booze
and smokes best we can.

606
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I got this... crazy idea.

607
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
- The big plan is this.
- We're gonna take the unions.

608
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
- The unions.
- Garment workers.

609
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
- The longshoremen.
- Not just New York unions.

610
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
- Chicago.
- The whole fucking country.

611
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
- The West Coast.
- What are you gonna do about...

612
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Don Masseria?
He's an old man.

613
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
- Masseria?
- What are you worried about?

614
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
- I just wanna run things.
- I'm not worried.

615
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
- A little more control.
- You gotta watch your back.

616
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Masseria?
What should we
do about him?

617
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I think it's
very tricky.
Yeah?

618
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
You should consider
many things with him.

619
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,000
You have something
in mind, I hope?
Yes, we do.

620
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
[ Sonny ]
Rothstein's
behind it.

621
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Then Rothstein
must die.

622
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Cash, money, unions.
I see what you're doing.

623
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,000
If I see,
Masseria sees.

624
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Everybody dies,
Charlie.

625
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I know.

626
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,000
This thing'll blow up
in your face.

627
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
When?
I don't know.

628
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
You give me such naches.

629
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Naches?

630
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
It's like pride, when a son
makes his father proud of him.

631
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Look at you!
You're bigger than me now!

632
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Eh.

633
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
When war comes,
and it'll come,

634
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:12,000
the winner will be the one
who gets his enemy to trust him.

635
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
How do I do that?

636
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:24,000
You save his life.

637
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000

Let me ask you something.

641
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
You ever dream
about this game?

642
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I do... every night...
nightmares.

643
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I got jacks up.
I'm lookin' at kings up.

644
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I got four aces.
Oh, sh--

645
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I'm looking at a straight flush.
Oh, looky here, looky here.

646
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Looks who's high, huh?
A thousand.

647
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Come on, come on.
You in or out?
I'm in.

648
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000

You in or out?

00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Are you in?
Huh?

651
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:39,000

Did I make a wrong bet?

653
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Sit down
and get wet.

00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,000
That was a beautiful
wedding, huh?

655
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Always makes me
cry like a baby--

madly in love.

to hear...

things that you
can't believe.

and all that dogshit,

How come
I ain't heard of it?

All the guys
you was talking to...

666
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
thought you was talking
to them, not me!

After all, I am your
number two, right?

668

Holy Christ,
screw 'em.

669
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
We could be bigger than
theJews, bigger than the Irish.

670
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
We could run
the whole fucking country.

671
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
You could be the next
John D. Rockefeller,
if you let me do it for you.

00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
See,Joe, it's
what I told ya's.

673
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
It's terrible what happened
to Rothstein, isn't it?

674
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Yeah, fuckin' terrible.

675
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
He got hit
in his own hotel room.

676
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
It's scary.

677
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Who, uh--
Who did it and why?

678
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Who knows? Gambling debts,
mad-dog killer.

679
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Who knows,
it's--

680
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:21,000
We're all shook up
around here.

00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
you're a swell guy.

683
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
But from now on,
you look the wrong way,

684
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:36,000
you fart in the
wrong direction--

685
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Joe, you're always
complainin' I don't eat.

686
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,000
If I don't eat,
how am I gonna fart, huh?

687
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Yeah.

688
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,000
He's funny.!

689
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Yeah, he's funny.

690
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I told ya's, five G's
on Sonny Boy in the fifth,

691
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
five G's on Star
in the sixth.

692
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Off the phone.
I'm makin' a bet!

693
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Beat it!

694
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Charlie,you know
who hit Rothstein.

695
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,000
You gotta kill him.

696
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I always said
you was the one, Charlie.

697
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
But if you're gonna
take him down,

698
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
get a price
from Faranzano.

699
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I, uh, always thought
your loyalty was toJoe.

700
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I loveJoe,

701
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:46,000
but this is business
and Faranzano's gonna win.

702
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:53,000
And if you do this,
you can write your own ticket.

703
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
How do we set
the meeting?

704
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I won't go to Brooklyn.
He won't come here.

705
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Pick a neutral territory.

706
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Staten Island,
Profaci's turf?

707
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Perfect!
I'll set it up.

708
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Okay.

709
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I always knew
you was the one, Charlie.

710
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
It's likeJoe Profaci's
invitin' me into his home.

711
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Right.
It's like a bar mitzvah.

712
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Look, if you told me something
because it was Jewish knowledge,

713
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I'd say okay. But now
you've gotta say okay.

714
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
This is between Italians.
I've known Profaci 20 years.

715
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I'm safe on his turf.
When things are
between Italians,

716
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
one of the Italians
ends up dead.

717
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Relax, Tommy Reina'll be there.
Tommy's my pal.

718
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Will you shut up?
Listen,

719
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
at least take
Bugsy and I along.

720
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
No, no. I take you guys,
it's a sign of distrust.

721
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,000
I want Faranzano
to trust me, huh?
Charlie's right.

722
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
It's true,
ain't it?

723
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,000
You changed. You're not
listening to your friends.

724
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Listen to you!
You let Mad Dog Coll live.

725
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
He's already killed Rothstein,
and who knows who's next!

726
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
You blame me for
A.R.'s death.
I don't blame you.

727
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
So what then?
I make one mistake.

728
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Suddenly you--
you know everything.

729
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Ah.
Hey, you're gettin'
a swelled head.

730
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I see it. I do!

731
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Meyer, don't ever
point your finger at me.

732
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Oh, excuse me,
Mr. Bigshot!

733
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Please, Charlie,

734
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I need you alive.

735
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I chose you as
our leader, remember?

736
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Remember that.
You chose me?

737
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
That ain't what I remember.
What I remember is,

738
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
you didn't have it.
I didn't have it?

739
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
I didn't have what?
I didn't have the guts?

740
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I didn't have the brains?
Don't make me
say it, okay?

741
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Fuck you. You got
somethin' to say?

742
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Fuck you! You fucking got
something to say to me?

743
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
I could've let you
die in the streets.
Come on, say it.!

744
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
That's your second mistake,
you fuck.

745
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Come on, Charlie.

746
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Meyer, come on.

747
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,000
All right!
All right!

748
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Look, you're
brilliant, okay?

749
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
But you ain't Italian.
You don't understand Italians.

750
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Without me,
you don't last two weeks.

751
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Yeah, because I would
screw up some Sicilian!

752
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Yeah. But you
said it yourself.

753
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
I got it, whatever it is.
Now I'm gonna use it.

754
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
You got it!
You got what?

755
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,000
At least I've got the brains
not to make a fatal mistake.

756
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Anna. You care about her.
You married her.

757
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
If you were out front,
she'd get hit.

758
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
And as tough as
you say you are,

759
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
you would never recover.

760
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
You see what I'm saying?
Without me,

761
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
you are a loser.

762
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Go on, then, Charlie.
Kill yourself.

763
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Bambino!
It's been too long.

764
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Profaci?
I told him it was
postponed to tomorrow.

765
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
He talks
too much anyway.

766
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
This is just
you and me, huh?

767
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Thanks for setting
this up, Tommy.

768
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
You're a pal.

769
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Charlie,you
understand business.

770
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
I'm a business man myself.
I.R.S. came last week.

771
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Eighteen hours,
they found nothing.

772
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
So, strictly business.

773
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I hope you can
appreciate some facts.

774
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Conditions have changed.

775
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Some people have gotten
too powerful.

776
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I'll take care of Masseria.

777
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Personally. I want you
to do it yourself.

778
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
That's not all, though.
Lansky and Siegel.

779
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
I know you've always
gotten along,

780
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
butJews,
they're different.

781
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
You cross 'em one time,
fight with 'em one time,
and they're gone.

782
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I know this.
I've heard.

783
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Heard what?

784
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
They're a different
race...Jews.

785
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
You take Communion.
I take Communion.

786
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
They don't even believe in sin,
for Christ's sake.

787
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
They're gonna
betray you,

788
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
just like they
betrayed Jesus Christ.

789
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
You join my family,

790
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
they die.

791
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:56,000
No one will even know
you approved.

792
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Looks like I don't have
a choice, do I?

793
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
No.

794
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Either I agree
to, uh,

795
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
kill my friends,
or you kill me.

796
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:13,000
That's right.

797
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I don't accept
the choices.

798
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Charlie, Charlie!

799
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Tough little bambino.

800
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
He's got balls--
Don't talk to me!

801
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Rocco.

802
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
What is this loyalty?

803
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Huh?

804
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
We're going to
kill them anyway.

805
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:14,000
All this is for nothing.

806
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Well?
I don't bend over.

807
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:24,000
It's too hard
to stand straight again.

808
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Long run, short run,

809
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
you have no choice.

810
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Salvatore-
Don't start.

811
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Tough guy,
isn't he, Tom?

812
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:01,000
- Hi.
- Hello.

813
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
How ya doin'?

814
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
I look beautiful, huh?

815
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
You look like shit.

816
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
It's good to see you
with your eyes open.

817
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Everybody's talkin' about you.
They say it's a miracle.

818
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
First time somebody got taken
for a ride and lived.

819
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
I guess I'm just lucky.
Yeah, lucky.

820
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
That's you,
Lucky Luciano.

821
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
So what aboutJoe?
Masseria.

822
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
He's confused.

823
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,000
He don't know if you're workin'
for him or Faranzano.

824
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,000
He's gotta be pissed,
but he ain't lifted a finger.

825
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
He can't figure out why
Faranzano didn't kill you.

826
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,000
He needs me.

827
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
He can't get close enough
to Masseria to do it himself.

828
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
He wants me to kill him.

829
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
- What's wrong with that?
- Sicilian law, Benny.

830
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Kill a don,
you can't never be a don.

831
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,000
We have to start a war.
Make those bastards
fight each other.

832
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
The only way to do that
is to kill somebody important.

833
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Have 'em blame it
on each other.

834
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,000
- Reina.
- Tommy?

835
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Faranzano will think
Masseria ordered the hit
'cause Tommy changed sides.

836
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
The Bronx is at stake.
He'll have to strike back.

837
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
You're talkin' about
a friend of mine, Meyer.

838
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Anybody touches Tommy--

839
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
No, it's done.
It's not done.

840
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Benny, Reina set me up.

841
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
When he went with Faranzano,
the don made him pay a price--

842
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:39,000
me.

843
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
I just don't believe--
I mean, Tommy would never--

844
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Meyer, from now on,
you and me, we gotta agree.

845
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
So if I start getting
a swelled head,just shoot me.

846
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
It'd be a lot
less painful.

847
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Ahem.

848
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
You guys gotta
get out of here.

849
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Take care of yourself.
See ya, Charlie.

850
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:11,000
See ya later, Frankie.

851
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
When the, uh,
war comes,

852
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
you're gonna be
in danger.

853
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Danger's not for girls?

854
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Maybe you oughta
leave town for a while.

855
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,000
You don't understand
anything, do you?

856
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I'm with you now.

857
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Okay?

858
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Okay.
Okay.

859
01:08:37,000 --> 01:09:01,000
You get some sleep.
Yeah.

860
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Benny.
Tommy.

861
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Come here.
How you doin', huh?

862
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
We gotta talk, Tommy.

863
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Where's Short Stick?

864
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,000
It's his day off.
He's at the dog track.

865
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:26,000
How's Charlie?

866
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Charlie's tough.

867
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Faranzano had no right!
He had no fuckin' right!

868
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
If I'd have known,
I'd have done something.

869
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,000
It wasn't your fault.

870
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:41,000
That's why I'm here.

871
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I wanna show you
there's no hard feelings.

872
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
I got somethin'.
Take it.

873
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Hey, what's this?
Huh?
Huh?

874
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
This was, I swear to God--

875
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
a friend of Frankie's
pinched it--

876
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
the personal property...
of Benito Mussolini.

877
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
- Il Duce.
- Il Duce.

878
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Oh, shit.

879
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:11,000
It's a nice gun.

880
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:18,000
We've been friends
a long time, huh, Tommy?

881
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
A long time.

882
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Yeah.

883
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
You know what
Charlie always says--

884
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:30,000
how this is America...
and everything is money.

885
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Yeah, I think I, uh--

886
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I think I may have
heard that somewheres.

887
01:10:36,000 --> 01:11:13,000
But this ain't money, Tommy.
This is friendship.

888
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
This is too big to
pay off the goddamn judges.

889
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
It's great that the bosses are
trying to knock each other off,

890
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,000
but they can't seem
to get the job done.
Take it easy.

891
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Then we'll have to
do it for them.

892
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Masseria?
Yeah.

893
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
There's just
one problem.

894
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,000
How do we get him
to trust us again?

895
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
I know.

896
01:11:37,000 --> 01:12:08,000
We save his life.

897
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:14,000
How's it goin',Joe?

898
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,000
How many times you gonna
fuck me, Charlie?

899
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
I got eyes, I see.
I got ears, I hear.

900
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I even got a brain.
Whatever you think,

901
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I've already thought it...
1 0 times over!

902
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
So then why
suspect me, huh?

903
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Staten Island?

904
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,000
You were pissed at me,
so I thought,

905
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
I'll tell Faranzano
I'm gonna make a deal with him.

906
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,000
He admits it.

907
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
How else can I set
a meeting with this guy?

908
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
How else can I
get close to him?

909
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
There's one thing
you haven't thought about.

910
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
I am going to kill
Faranzano.

911
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:56,000
If I live, he dies.

912
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
That's what I went
to Staten Island to do.

913
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Obviously, uh,

914
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:16,000
it didn't work out
as I planned it.

915
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:24,000
You got 48 hours
to kill him.

916
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Mr. Lucky Luciano!

917
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
You know, what's great is that
there's no hard feelings.

918
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I-- I'll take you guys
out to dinner tonight.

919
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Where you wanna go?

920
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Anyplace you wanna go.
Anyplace
you wanna go.

921
01:13:45,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I mean, it's on me.

922
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Frankie.!

923
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
- Where's the car?
- Staten Island.

924
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
You enjoyed Charlie
gettin' tortured, didn't you,

925
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,000
you fucking shit.
Yeah, but--

926
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
But you said
all was forgiven.

927
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:41,000
It is.

928
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Come on,Joe.
Get away.

929
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
That's... 1 5 times.

930
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
I told you, Charlie,

931
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,000
they will never kill me.

932
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Never.

933
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:22,000
By the way...
thanks.

934
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Ehi.

935
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Sorry what
I had to do.

936
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Why do they call them
king of beasts?

937
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
They don't hunt.
They don't kill.

938
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:47,000
All they do is eat,
shit and fornicate.

939
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Just like some
fat people I know.

940
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Let's talk business.

941
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,000
The only way I can kill Masseria
is if you lose the war.

942
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Masseria has to think
he's won.

943
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
I give you a week.

944
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
One more thing.

945
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Don't ever, ever
touch my friends.

946
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Your lives
will be your own.

947
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Let's go.

948
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Hey! Ha, ha!

949
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
We did it, huh?

950
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
We did it!

951
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Aaah!

952
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
We won!

953
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I knew we would,Joe.

954
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
So, when do we
wipe out Faranzano?

955
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,000
This week?
Next week?

956
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Next year.
What's the hurry, huh?
Right.

957
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Let the fucker sweat.
Right.

958
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
It looks good.
Not bad. Wait.

959
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Try this.
Salsiccia.
Mmm.

960
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Tell me something,Joe.

961
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
What do you love, huh?

962
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,000
What do I love?
What kind of question is that?

963
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Conversation while we eat.
What do you love?

964
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I love food.

965
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
I love pussy.
You know.

966
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Young pussy.

967
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
But, uh,

968
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,000
most of all,
I love to destroy people.

969
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Anybody?
The bigger the better.

970
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
But... anybody.

971
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Makes me feel...
good.

972
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:53,000
There's something I've
been meaning to ask you
about your nephew.

973
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,000
He was a pal of mine.
Your namesake, right?

974
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Yeah. He was a...

975
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
good kid.

976
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Yeah, he was.

977
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
You forgot this, but I was
there the day he got killed.

978
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,000
On the street?
Yeah.

979
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
You see,
I've been wonderin'...

980
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
why'd you kill
your own blood, huh?

981
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Some kind of
family dispute.

982
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
I don't remember.

983
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
We're family,
ain't we?

984
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Yeah.

985
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Family, huh?
Mm-hmm.

986
01:18:37,000 --> 01:19:07,000
I gotta take a leak.

987
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Joe, this ain't number 1 6.

988
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Come on.

989
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,000
My friends!
Honorable men!

990
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:52,000
I welcome you today
as your Caesar.

991
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,000
The boss of all bosses!

992
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Capo de tutti capi.

993
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
To give
impartial leadership,

994
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I have turned over my interests
to other members of my family.

995
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:20,000
In return, I will receive
a fair share of the proceeds...

996
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
from all the families
across the country.

997
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:29,000
From now on, we will be
divided into five families,

998
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
and the capo
from each family...

999
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,000
will report to me.

1000
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Mr. Thomas Gagliano.

1001
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Mr.Joseph Bonanno.

1002
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Mr.Joseph Profaci.

1003
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Mr. Vincent Mangano.

1004
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:07,000
And Mr. Charlie Luciano.

1005
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Who will supervise
the entire operation...

1006
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:15,000
under my direction.

1007
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Now I ask you to come forward
and pay respects,

1008
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
not to me,

1009
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:25,000
but to the office I hold.

1010
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Dei gratia et iatalorum...

1011
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:43,000
in volutate.

1012
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Grazie.

1013
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Grand'onore.

1014
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
It's a great privilege,
Don Faranzano.

1015
01:21:52,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Excuse us.

1016
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Ready for this?
Faranzano brought in Coll...

1017
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
to ice you.

1018
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,000
What?

1019
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Know what we
have to do?

1020
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Have a good day,
Mr. Coll.

1021
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:12,000
You guys are so stupid!

1022
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:18,000
The problem is...
I don't feel it.

1023
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:27,000
All this blood,
I don't feel a thing.

1024
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,000
The way I see it,
we got two problems:

1025
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,000
getting past his outer
guards and having him
invite us into his office.

1026
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I could pay some cop
to kill him.

1027
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Give me the money
and I'll do it.
No, no.

1028
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Brains,
not brawn.

1029
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
This is somethin' we need
to do ourselves.

1030
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Pride... that's his weakness.

1031
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Don't people say
you look more like a
bookkeeper than a gangster?

1032
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
So, you look like
a second baseman!

1033
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
You see, Faranzano's the only
mug I ever heard brag...

1034
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:07,000
about being audited
by the I.R.S.

1035
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
He came out clean, so he figures
his shit don't stink. Right?

1036
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
His shit don't stink.
So?

1037
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Seeing as how he enjoyed
the experience so much,

1038
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:42,000
why don't we give it
to him again?

1039
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
I'm scared.

1040
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Huh?

1041
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,000
I'm scared.

1042
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Everything I want...

1043
01:24:55,000 --> 01:26:05,000
is right here.
All I have to do is take it.

1044
01:26:05,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Morning.
Mmm.

1045
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Oh,Jesus Christ.

1046
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Name it, Frankie.
Anything.

1047
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Whatever the department
can do.

1048
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,000
The body
goes out covered.

1049
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
So far as the press knows,
it's Charlie.

1050
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:09,000
You got it.

1051
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Hey, Benny.

1052
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Those bastards!
They'll pay.

1053
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
It's like
you told me, Charlie.

1054
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,000
If you loved her...

1055
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:38,000
it was a mistake.

1056
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:43,000
You gotta come out
of it, Charlie.

1057
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
This is the moment.

1058
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:50,000
This is the test.

1059
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:56,000
They're the ones
who made the mistake.

1060
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Shut up and
give me the don.

1061
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Don, Don, Don.
You got the dough?

1062
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:10,000
- Charlie's dead?
- Deep fryin' in hell.

1063
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
You want the other three
to join him?

1064
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Come on over.

1065
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I'll pay you for this.
Give you instructions.

1066
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:24,000
I'll be over.

1067
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Mad Dog Coll's coming over
to get paid.

1068
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:33,000
When he walks in,
put him on ice.

1069
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:41,000
My pleasure.

1070
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Here's my key. 31 2.

1071
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Yes, absolutely.

1072
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Mr. Coll, I sent
your room service.

1073
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
It must be on its way.
I don't know.

1074
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,000
You don't know if
it's on the way up?

1075
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Coll.
Give it to me again.

1076
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,000
I want two eggs up.
I want a rasher of bacon.

1077
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
I want a pot of coffee, black.
And I want it now!

1078
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,000
I want a pot of coffee, black.
And I want it now!

1079
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Right now,
or I'll--

1080
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Room service.

1081
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,000
It's about time.

1082
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Bring it in.

1083
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,000
What's your handle?
Because...

1084
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:24,000
I wanna talk to your boss,
that's why.

1085
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:35,000
I just want
your undivided attention.

1086
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Son of a bitch!

1087
01:31:49,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Oh, my God.Jesus.!

1088
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:17,000
I.R.S. raid.
Get goin'.

1089
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:29,000
I said, get lost! Now!

1090
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Anybody else got
any bright ideas?

1091
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Now, beat it!

1092
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Nice work, Cliff.
Okay.

1093
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Mr. Faranzano?
It's the I.R.S. again.

1094
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Show them in.

1095
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Don't even
think about it.

1096
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Hey, you want it
in the eyeball?

1097
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Drop it!
Heaters on the floor! Now!

1098
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Siegel, drop it.!

1099
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,000
All right, Lansky,
over there.

1100
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:23,000
You too, Costello...
over with your Yid friends.

1101
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Ah, this is pretty.

1102
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,000
- Kill 'em!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1103
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,000
How much is it worth?

1104
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Anything!
Hundred grand!

1105
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,000
- You don't like yourself much.
- Two hundred!

1106
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Five. Come on, say it! Five!

1107
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
All right, five.

1108
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Truth is, I like my work.
I would've done it for nothin'.

1109
01:33:47,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Okay, boys.

1110
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,000
That's number three,
Meyer.

1111
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
This time I want you
to thank me.

1112
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Thank you.

1113
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:20,000
No, you crazyJews!

1114
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Remember this?

1115
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Sicilian law,
remember?

1116
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
You kill a don--
All right.
Just do like I said.

1117
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Slow.
What are you doing?

1118
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Why slowly?
'Cause I tortured you?

1119
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
No, no, no. It's what
you did 1 5 years ago.

1120
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Jesus! You want revenge
after 1 5 years?

1121
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:46,000
I've been busy.
Get up!

1122
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:50,000
At least tell me...

1123
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
what I did
1 5 years ago.

1124
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,000
No!
Want me to tell you?

1125
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Wanna know
what you did?

1126
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Tell me, what'd I do
1 5 years ago?

1127
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:04,000
You destroyed my father!

1128
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Your father? I don't
even remember your father!

1129
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Exactly.

1130
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Charlie.

1131
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:21,000
No, no, please!

1132
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
No.!

1133
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Ahhh!

1134
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Hey, Lucky.

1135
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Sit.

1136
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:54,000
I want to thank Mr. Capone
for hosting this meeting.

1137
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Sit down and shut up,
will ya?

1138
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Hey, there ain't
gonna be a boss.

1139
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:09,000
You all know
how I got this.

1140
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
MaybeJoe Profaci, here--

1141
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Wait a minute.
What're you saying?
Don't worry.

1142
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Maybe you knew it was
gonna happen to me,

1143
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
maybe you didn't.

1144
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
But by the old way
of doin' things,

1145
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:26,000
if I become boss now, I have
to hit you in case you knew.

1146
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
And all of you shrug?

1147
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Except some of you
are friends ofJoe's.

1148
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:37,000
And one day I might do
something, that, uh,

1149
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:41,000
upsets you,
then you'll hit me.

1150
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Then you become boss.
My friends, they hate you.

1151
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Somebody else becomes boss,
and on, and on, and on.

1152
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Know what I call that?
Stupid. Very stupid.

1153
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:58,000
So, if you ain't doin' it,
who's gonna be--

1154
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Nobody.
We're all bosses here.

1155
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:05,000
What then, Charlie?
We're gonna vote on everything?

1156
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
That's right.

1157
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Everybody here...
is equal.

1158
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Corporations have
a board of directors.

1159
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:21,000
So will we.
A commission.

1160
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Now, I have friends.
They're not from Palermo,

1161
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:28,000
not from Sicily...
they're not even Italians.

1162
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,000
They'reJewish.
And I trust 'em.

1163
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Anybody have a problem
with that?

1164
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,000
You say there's gonna
be no boss, but you're
startin' to talk like one.

1165
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
I've learned.

1166
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Every organization
needs somebody...

1167
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
standin'out front.

1168
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Call it a figurehead,
a leader,

1169
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
whatever.

1170
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:55,000
It doesn't much matter
to me who does it.

1171
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:00,000
I say we make Charlie Luciano
head of our national commission.

1172
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Who agrees?

1173
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
You want it, Al?
It's yours.

1174
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Hell, no.
I want you to do it.

1175
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
It's justJulius Caesar
never took no vote.

1176
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:32,000
That's why Caesar ended up
dead in the street.

1177
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Any other business?

1178
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Hey, friendship.

1179
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Friendship.
Friendship.
