00:14:28,597 --> 00:14:31,180
[upbeat music]

184
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,077
You good?

185
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:36,803
Yeah, I'm fine, why?

186
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,702
Well, everything go okay?

187
00:14:40,704 --> 00:14:41,713
What do you mean?

188
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,628
The delivery.

189
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,763
Oh, yeah, that,

190
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,933
just peachy.

191
00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:52,915
Peachy?

192
00:14:55,267 --> 00:14:56,369
Dude, you're weird.

193
00:14:56,371 --> 00:14:57,621
Leave me alone.

194
00:15:01,164 --> 00:15:03,798
[door knocking]

195
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,958
Oh, why today of all days?

196
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,860
I just want sleep.

197
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,818
[door knocking]

198
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,343
- Can I help you?
- No.

199
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,123
Yes, actually.

200
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,581
One moment.

201
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,518
[door banging]

202
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,353
Do you mind?

203
00:15:31,962 --> 00:15:33,281
- Yeah.
- Oh, oh, oh.

204
00:15:33,283 --> 00:15:34,116
Mm-hmm.

205
00:15:39,323 --> 00:15:41,248
What the hell were you doing in my room?

206
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,668
Well, look, I swear,

207
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,102
I didn't even know that you were in there.

208
00:15:45,104 --> 00:15:47,168
He dropped his room key.

209
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,148
Yeah, yeah, you should
totally have it back up.

210
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,970
I'm sorry about that.

211
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,128
I saw him walking around
with dirt and stuff in there

212
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,708
and he never really talks to anyone.

213
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,538
I thought that I saw him carry
a dead body into his car,

214
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,418
and I don't know, just the
whole thing looked really shady.

215
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,698
Shady?

216
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,953
Yeah, like maybe he's
a killer or something.

217
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,518
My brother?

218
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,188
Yeah, I don't know.

219
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,023
He's not.

220
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:16,808
Okay, well, that's cool, I guess.

221
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,193
I just wasn't feeling good,

222
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,603
and the dirt's for the bath, obviously.

223
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,817
It's not that strange.

224
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:30,618
Oh, no, no, I've heard of
people take mud baths and stuff

225
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,818
because it's supposed to be
good for your skin and stuff,

226
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,978
but I've just never really done that.

227
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,173
Yeah, I always shower.

228
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,103
Not always.

229
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,488
I don't shower all the time.

230
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,778
I don't have some sort
of a weird odor problem

231
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,880
or anything like that.

232
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:49,018
I'm a clean person.

233
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,453
I shower the normal amount.

234
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,428
Gotcha, well, look,
whatever your name is,

235
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,698
don't come into my room again, got it?

236
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,913
Yeah, of course.

237
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:03,468
[emotional music]

238
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,303
Noah.

239
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:06,948
What?

240
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,063
I'm Noah.

241
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,203
Yeah, I just thought you should know.

242
00:17:13,097 --> 00:17:13,930
Zooey.

243
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,700
Nice to meet ya.

244
00:17:19,097 --> 00:17:19,939
[door banging]

245
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:22,523
[upbeat music]

246
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:28,743
What?

247
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,573
Who was that?

248
00:17:32,575 --> 00:17:33,408
Nobody.

249
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,558
Does nobody have a name?

250
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,688
- Just forget it.
- All right, fine.

251
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,348
If you don't wanna share.

252
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,748
I just walked into the
wrong room, that's all.

253
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,918
[laughs] It's a motel.

254
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,408
- There's numbers on the door.
- Yeah, just drop the subject.

255
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:50,403
I'm off, I'm off. [sighs]

256
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,168
She was cute.

257
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,434
Shut up.

258
00:17:59,436 --> 00:18:02,103
[Owen laughing]

259
00:18:03,514 --> 00:18:06,014
[dog barking]

260
00:18:12,645 --> 00:18:15,395
[dramatic music]

261
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:21,843
[gate banging]

262
00:18:21,845 --> 00:18:25,393
Oh, sorry, I didn't
know anyone was in here.

263
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,173
No, no, it's fine, really, totally.

264
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,243
It's fine.

265
00:18:33,156 --> 00:18:35,739
[gate banging]

266
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,263
So you planning on swimming?

267
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,358
What?

268
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,623
Oh, no.

269
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:10,413
Oh, I get it, you
don't know how to swim.

270
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,318
Oh my God, you actually
don't know how to swim.

271
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,373
It's fine.

272
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,573
Nobody taught me.

273
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,777
How about you?

274
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,288
Well, I wouldn't come to the pool

275
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,740
if I didn't know how to swim.

276
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:36,943
I did.

277
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:49,402
[water splashing]

278
00:20:08,782 --> 00:20:09,615
Ah, okay,

279
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:19,975
I'm just gonna have to go in.

280
00:20:21,135 --> 00:20:22,802
I can do this, okay.

281
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,338
Oh, God, I'm sorry,

282
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,233
it just looked like you were
maybe drowning or something.

283
00:20:35,298 --> 00:20:36,129
I don't know.

284
00:20:36,131 --> 00:20:37,783
You were just under there
for a very long time.

285
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:44,148
Were you gonna jump in?

286
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,470
- Well, I was...
- Zooey.

287
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:51,040
[water splashing]

288
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,407
[gate banging]

289
00:20:57,409 --> 00:21:00,076
[bugs chirping]

290
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,730
What were you thinking?

291
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,278
You can't just run off like that.

292
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,858
I didn't run off.

293
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,988
I went to go swim.

294
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,508
I don't care where you went.

295
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,860
What if something happened?

296
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,298
You're being paranoid.

297
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,198
I'm being cautious, Zooey.

298
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,608
Do you want to spend the
rest of your time in a place

299
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,608
that doesn't understand you?

300
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:33,723
A place that'll hurt you until it does?

301
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,468
No.

302
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,558
Because that's what's going to happen

303
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,293
if somebody finds out. [sighs]

304
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,583
I'm just trying to keep you safe.

305
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,420
If anything were to happen to you, I...

306
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,493
Just please?

307
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:06,611
You don't have much more time.

308
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,593
I'm sorry.

309
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,023
I know. [sighs]

310
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,263
Who was that out there?

311
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:22,923
Just some kid.

312
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:27,192
Okay.

313
00:22:33,334 --> 00:22:34,165
[door banging]

314
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:39,073
[cheers] What are you doing?

315
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:42,624
Nothing.

316
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,340
You're weird, kid.

317
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,527
Don't go in there for awhile. [laughs]

318
00:22:52,517 --> 00:22:55,618
[bed creaking]

319
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,203
[Owen snoring]

320
00:23:21,357 --> 00:23:22,857
Extraterrestrials.

[Noah yawning]

322
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,360
Can't sleep, huh?

323
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,788
Milkshake time, let's go.

324
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,008
What time?

325
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:23,197
You heard me, it's milkshake time.

326
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:24,032
Go, let's go.

327
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:28,881
Come on.

328
00:24:28,883 --> 00:24:31,809

[radio chattering]

330
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,143
Ow, brain freeze.

331
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,503
Oh, I love milkshakes.

332
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,693
So?

333
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,048
What?

334
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:52,923
That girl.

335
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,418
- Zooey?
- Bingo.

336
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,206
She has a name.

337
00:24:58,208 --> 00:24:59,041
Shut up.

338
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,048
[laughs] Oh, man, so how's she doing?

339
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:07,058
- Fine.
- Oh, you think she's fine?

340
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,553
That is not what I said.

341
00:25:08,555 --> 00:25:12,823
[laughs] Oh, man,

342
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,998
to be young again, chasing girls around.

343
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,600
You did a lot of girl chasing?

344
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:21,863
Nope.

345
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,823
Just aliens then?

346
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,840
Yo, wait, is that...?

347
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,113
Yo, what is that?

348
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,598
That's a freaking UFO.

349
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,738
That's a goddamn...

350
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:42,623
Wait, my bad, that's a plane.

351
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:49,883
Anyway, I'm happy for you, kid, truly.

352
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,313
You should ask her out. [slurps]

353
00:26:02,512 --> 00:26:07,262
[yawns] Oh, man, I don't know about you,

354
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:10,633
but all this sugar's making me tired.

355
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,103
Ready to go?

356
00:26:14,516 --> 00:26:17,185
Let's do it.

357
00:26:17,187 --> 00:26:20,848
[Woman On TV] Yes, dear, what is it?

358
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:25,300
When I came to your
place, it was because of...

359
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,150
[Woman On TV] Yes?

360
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,357
I just arrived here.

361
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,988
I did not know where else to go,

362
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,483
but everything was so strange to me.

363
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:42,580
I'm glad you came, so is grandpa.

364
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:45,543
Gotta meet family and friends.

365
00:26:46,556 --> 00:26:49,223
[TV chattering]

366
00:27:09,144 --> 00:27:11,811
[door knocking]

367
00:27:16,457 --> 00:27:17,336
Hey.

368
00:27:17,338 --> 00:27:18,171
Hey.

369
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,313
So what's up?

370
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,301
Nothing.

371
00:27:23,303 --> 00:27:25,688
[mysterious music]

372
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:28,173
Okay, guess I'll see you later then.

373
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:29,961
Oh, wait, wait,

374
00:27:29,963 --> 00:27:31,498
I came over here to ask you

375
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:36,083
if you wanted to go see
something or go do something?

376
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:40,163
Go out to do something with me?

377
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,623
Yeah, sure.

378
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,558
Yeah?

379
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,393
Yeah.

380
00:27:48,826 --> 00:27:49,659
Yeah?

381
00:27:50,618 --> 00:27:52,234
Mm-hmm.

382
00:27:52,236 --> 00:27:53,819
Yeah, okay, cool.

383
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,960
I'll just go and find with
something for us to do.

384
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,633
I'll get back to you.

385
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:06,723
Sounds good.

386
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,493
For awesome.

387
00:28:12,164 --> 00:28:14,747
[door banging]

388
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,523
For awesome?

389
00:28:23,092 --> 00:28:25,057
For awesome.

390
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:27,728
[TV chattering]

391
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:30,313
[upbeat music]

392
00:30:46,207 --> 00:30:49,124
[lights crackling]

393
00:30:52,452 --> 00:30:55,202
[Owen whistling]

394
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:10,785
[gentle music]

395
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,103
Mind if I sit?

396
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,213
Plenty of room.

397
00:32:05,688 --> 00:32:07,618
You live next door, right?

398
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,453
Taylor?

399
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:10,763
Yeah.

400
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:14,963
Owen.

401
00:32:22,738 --> 00:32:24,405
Want a beer, Owen?

402
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,663
Yeah, yeah.

403
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,383
- So...
- They can't be together.

404
00:33:06,503 --> 00:33:10,328
Zooey doesn't have time
to be playing around

405
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,893
with your little Noah.

406
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,448
What do you mean?

407
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,188
They're pretty good together.

408
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,723
Yeah, that's the problem.

409
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,113
It's not gonna work, it can't work,

410
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,250
so there's no point in them both

411
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,650
getting their feelings hurt.

412
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,333
But isn't that just a process though?

413
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,381
They're young.

414
00:33:43,383 --> 00:33:45,810
It's not like they're going
to be together forever.

415
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,183
What's going on?

416
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:56,683
I'm sorry.

417
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,848
You're fine.

418
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:01,683
No, it's okay.

419
00:34:05,428 --> 00:34:06,843
Zooey's got a condition

420
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:14,503
and we don't have much longer,

421
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,713
so we just drove,

422
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:28,918
figured we'd see the country.

423
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,078
I'd never been further
west than Wisconsin,

424
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,003
so you know what's in Wisconsin?

425
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,733
Cheese?

426
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,253
Yeah, yeah, and nothing else.

427
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,060
- So you're just gonna...
- Just gonna go.

428
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,822
We figured we'd just really go.

429
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,520
This can't be the
final destination though.

430
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,203
No, no, it is nice though.

431
00:35:14,395 --> 00:35:16,978
[gentle music]

432
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,343
Yeah?

433
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,993
She picked it.

434
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:34,560
That'll be great.

435
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,413
So how long's she have left?

436
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:04,411
I don't know, I don't know,

437
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:07,883
a couple of weeks or less.

438
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,933
You can finish the beer.

439
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,140
Okay, I want to show you something,

440
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,857
but you have to promise
not to scream or anything?

441
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:38,798
What?

442
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,631
Promise.

443
00:36:39,633 --> 00:36:41,783
Okay, I promise.

444
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:57,220
Oh, hey, that's... [gasps]

445
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,413
You're a...

446
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,999
What are you?

447
00:37:08,001 --> 00:37:11,408
I'm not from here.

448
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:12,818
Does anybody else know?

449
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,720
Just my brother.

450
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,468
This is amazing.

451
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,348
Can you do that tongue thing again?

452
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,181
What?

453
00:37:19,183 --> 00:37:20,016
No.

454
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:26,128
This is crazy, crazy.

455
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,478
My girlfriend is an alien.

456
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,593
Hang on, girlfriend?

457
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,228
Did I say girlfriend?

458
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,438
No, no.

459
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,514
What I meant to say was...

460
00:37:37,516 --> 00:37:41,078
No, no, I like it.

461
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,573
- Really?
- Yeah.

462
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:46,573
It just seems right.

463
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,438
I have so many questions.

464
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,390
Where are you from?

465
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,398
I don't know.

466
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,348
Oh, and the mud baths.

467
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,972
Is that how you feed or something?

468
00:38:00,974 --> 00:38:02,288
[laughs] No.

469
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:03,468
Can you breathe under water?

470
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,878
Oh, oh, oh, can you fly

471
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,030
or do you have super
strength or something?

472
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,943
Wow. [laughs]

473
00:38:20,362 --> 00:38:23,362
[fireworks banging]

474
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
So out of all the places,

475
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,273
why in a motel?

476
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:50,140
Before I was adopted by Richard,

477
00:38:51,634 --> 00:38:54,148
[emotional music]

478
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,463
he found me here.

479
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:01,683
I guess my parents just
left me there on the steps.

480
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,703
I don't know, dude.

481
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,773
I just feel like I've
always felt at home here,

482
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,123
more than any other place anyway.

483
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,080
I didn't know my parents either.

484
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,168
I always thought,

485
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:26,483
out of all the places they
could've left me in the galaxy,

486
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,223
they chose here.

487
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:37,313
Your brother, is he...?

488
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:43,203
No, he just found me,

489
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:45,903
saved me.

490
00:39:48,806 --> 00:39:51,670
He never told anyone what I was.

491
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,493
He always protected me.

492
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,213
What about your parents?

493
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,383
Do you think they'll ever come back?

494
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,121
It doesn't matter anymore.

495
00:40:14,123 --> 00:40:15,223
It doesn't matter?

496
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,850
What's that supposed to mean?

497
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,173
I just don't care.

498
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:29,403
Do you think your parents
are out there somewhere?

499
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,750
I don't know.

500
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,503
Maybe.

501
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,043
Maybe not.

502
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:44,963
Well, I'm glad now that
my parents left me here.

503
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,353
I'm happy.

504
00:41:09,169 --> 00:41:11,919
[pigeons cooing]

505
00:41:15,771 --> 00:41:18,354
[door banging]

506
00:41:21,038 --> 00:41:22,371
Mm, whoa, man.

507
00:41:23,466 --> 00:41:26,278
[bed creaking]

508
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,141
Why you so smiley?

509
00:41:27,143 --> 00:41:30,338
We live about 20 steps
from her door to mine.

510
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,440
I think I'm in love.

511
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:38,828
Whoa, hold up, love?

512
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,828
Like love love?

513
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,378
Yeah.

514
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,213
Shit,

515
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,333
what's it like?

516
00:41:53,705 --> 00:41:55,478
It's really weird.

517
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,248
Yeah, well, considering
the circumstances.

518
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:01,289
I just don't even know
what to do with my life.

519
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:02,398
[Owen laughing]

520
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,468
What?

521
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,301
- What's so funny?
- You don't know what to do

522
00:42:04,303 --> 00:42:06,048
with your life. [laughs]

523
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,688
Kid, I'm 30 years old,
living out of a motel,

524
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:11,378
using an empty chip bag
as a damn trashcan liner,

525
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,671
not to mention the only socializing I do

526
00:42:12,673 --> 00:42:14,828
is with a 14 year old.

527
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:17,198
[laughs] And whose fault is that?

528
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,158
Entirely mine. [laughs]

529
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,813
No, wait, so tell me what happened.

530
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,697
Oh, that's what you're going...

531
00:42:26,699 --> 00:42:27,530
You're not going to tell me?

532
00:42:27,532 --> 00:42:28,363
You're just going to...

533
00:42:28,365 --> 00:42:29,348
Okay, okay, all right, fine.

534
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,181
No donuts for you.

535
00:42:30,183 --> 00:42:31,016
Get out of here.

536
00:42:38,576 --> 00:42:41,743
[car engines roaring]

537
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:58,098
I can see why you like this stuff.

538
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,608
It's so...

539
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:00,688
Sugary?

540
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:02,338
Yeah.

541
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,568
Here, have one of these.

542
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:07,423
It's always been one of my favorites.

543
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:17,540
Your eyes...

544
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,918
I've just never seen them like that.

545
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,028
Yeah, they do that sometimes.

546
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:30,463
No, it's beautiful.

547
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:37,690
I can't believe you've
never had any of these.

548
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:41,498
Yeah, my brother
doesn't really allow it.

549
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,333
That sucks.

550
00:43:43,657 --> 00:43:46,408
One time, Owen and I got a huge
bucket full of these things

551
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:48,323
and we downed it in 15 minutes.

552
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:50,868
Owen?

553
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:52,928
Yeah, the guy I live with.

554
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:53,880
Oh, your brother.

555
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:57,923
Not exactly.

556
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:02,803
He's like family.

557
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:04,887
Like family?

558
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:12,693
Is, I guess, is family.

559
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:19,123
Here, try one of these.

560
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,363
I do have to warn you though,

561
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:27,352
they tend to get a little bit... [laughs]

562
00:44:27,354 --> 00:44:28,558
[glass smashing]
[Owen screaming]

563
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,393
Oh, no.

564
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,568
Sour.

565
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:33,401
Noah.

566
00:44:33,403 --> 00:44:34,780
Sorry, Owen.

567
00:44:34,782 --> 00:44:38,328
Boy, you and that girl,
you're lucky, mm-hmm,

568
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:41,013
but you not sleeping
here tonight, go on home.

569
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:44,624
[door banging]

570
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:55,423
So what's going on?

571
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:57,583
Here.

572
00:44:58,658 --> 00:45:00,568
Zooey, what are you doing with those?

573
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:02,738
Aren't you a little curious?

574
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,268
About what?

575
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:05,483
To try it, dummy.

576
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:07,263
No.

577
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:13,371
Okay, fine, it doesn't smell too bad.

578
00:45:13,373 --> 00:45:16,468
What if you're allergic
to it or something?

579
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:18,848
I don't have any problems with gluten.

580
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,098
That's not what I'm talking about.

581
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,468
It's fine, Noah, here, try some.

582
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,303
[Noah] No.

583
00:45:25,418 --> 00:45:28,513
Fine, you're going to
make me drink alone then.

584
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:32,248
Oh, nice, peer pressure now.

585
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:33,681
Suit yourself.

586
00:45:33,683 --> 00:45:36,766
[paper bag rustling]

587
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,920
Why do we adults drink that?

588
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:44,763
I honestly don't know.

589
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:47,298
You can finish it.

590
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,131
After all that,

591
00:45:48,133 --> 00:45:50,297
you honestly think that
I'm going to want some?

592
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,668
Let's go do something else.

593
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:54,813
Oh my God.

594
00:45:55,758 --> 00:45:59,091
[truck engine whirring]

595
00:46:05,438 --> 00:46:08,021
[upbeat music]

596
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:29,985
[door clicking]

597
00:46:35,491 --> 00:46:38,123
Owen, hey, what's going on?

598
00:46:42,323 --> 00:46:45,510
I think I might have something for you.

599
00:46:45,512 --> 00:46:47,679
Okay, let's have a look.

600
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,423
Oh, wow,

601
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:59,980
I haven't seen one of these
come in here for quite a while.

602
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:03,217
Where'd you get it?

603
00:47:03,219 --> 00:47:04,669
I had it since I was a kid.

604
00:47:06,189 --> 00:47:07,289
It was my first comic.

605
00:47:12,911 --> 00:47:13,828
You sure?

606
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,048
You sure you want to sell?

607
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:17,883
I do.

608
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:20,243
Yeah.

609
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:28,268
Okay, well, the last
one we had come in here

610
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:30,070
was pretty beat up, let me tell you.

611
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:33,693
Still, it went for quite a bit,

612
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:40,710
but since this one's
mint, or basically mint,

613
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:44,790
probably looking at...

614
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:56,148
- Bull shit.
- No, sir.

615
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:58,113
[laughs] What?

616
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:01,878
I know a guy who would
buy this in a heartbeat.

617
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:02,713
Who?

618
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:05,818
- Me.
- Really?

619
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,965
You say the word, I'll get
my cheque book right now.

620
00:48:08,967 --> 00:48:13,967
[laughs] You promise to
take good care of it, yeah?

621
00:48:15,817 --> 00:48:16,817
Of course.

622
00:48:25,096 --> 00:48:27,263
Let me get my cheque book.

623
00:48:37,635 --> 00:48:40,385
[dramatic music]

624
00:49:31,172 --> 00:49:32,005
Zooey.

625
00:49:33,591 --> 00:49:36,424
[water splashing]

626
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:41,340
It's okay, just breathe.

627
00:49:43,787 --> 00:49:45,287
Hey, just breathe.

628
00:49:48,844 --> 00:49:50,344
You're doing okay.

629
00:49:54,937 --> 00:49:56,187
You'll be okay.

630
00:49:59,655 --> 00:50:01,905
Keep breathing, okay, okay.

631
00:50:07,427 --> 00:50:10,677
[car engines whirring]

632
00:50:14,529 --> 00:50:17,112
[door banging]

633
00:50:24,133 --> 00:50:25,657
Zooey's busy right now.

634
00:50:27,026 --> 00:50:28,295
Yeah, okay, I was just...

635
00:50:28,297 --> 00:50:30,880
[door banging]

636
00:50:46,484 --> 00:50:50,073
[Woman On TV] [indistinct],
my sisters are calling.

637
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,693
Wake up, wake up now.

638
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,063
Our sisters are awake.

639
00:50:57,065 --> 00:50:58,518
They're hungry.

640
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,460
They've slept it off.

641
00:51:00,462 --> 00:51:02,879
It's time to go into the sea.

642
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,561
[door banging]

643
00:51:32,911 --> 00:51:33,742
Zooey?

644
00:51:33,744 --> 00:51:36,577
[emotional music]

645
00:51:46,967 --> 00:51:49,800
[water splashing]

646
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,972
[door banging]

647
00:51:54,974 --> 00:51:56,391
Where you been?

648
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:03,630
Are you just gonna ignore me like that?

649
00:52:20,795 --> 00:52:23,712
[leaves crackling]

650
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,628
I didn't even know you were coming.

651
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:36,463
[Zooey] Yeah.

652
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:41,018
Do you want to go somewhere?

653
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:43,143
[Zooey] Can we just sit and talk?

654
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:45,793
Yeah, sure.

655
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,328
I came over and knocked earlier...

656
00:52:57,330 --> 00:52:58,163
I know.

657
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,428
He just seemed pretty upset with me.

658
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:03,918
It's not you.

659
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,888
Really?

660
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,793
Sometimes he just gets like that.

661
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:10,743
Like what?

662
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:17,753
Stressed out, mad or something,

663
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,848
usually because of me.

664
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:22,950
I'm sure it's not always because of you.

665
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:25,450
You're just saying that.

666
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,893
No, I'm really not.

667
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,753
Look, Noah,

668
00:53:36,364 --> 00:53:38,293
I don't think we should see each other.

669
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:43,358
What, you don't think...?

670
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,193
Why not?

671
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,593
We can't hang out, not anymore.

672
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:54,268
Is it Taylor?

673
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:56,143
No, it's not my brother.

674
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:03,628
What did I do?

675
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:04,880
You didn't do anything.

676
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,523
It's just because it's what I want.

677
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,128
I don't understand.

678
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,430
It's what's best for me.

679
00:54:22,247 --> 00:54:23,080
Okay.

680
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:57,063
New, bold, daring, I hate it.

681
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,400
Yo, you all right?

682
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:09,253
Talk to me, kid.

683
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:14,458
Zooey doesn't want to see me anymore.

684
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,510
Why? What happened?

685
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:18,263
I don't know.

686
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,475
I guess I'm just not good enough.

687
00:55:21,477 --> 00:55:24,088
Oh, what the hell are you talking about?

688
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:25,493
She's just so special.

689
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:27,758
I'm just me.

690
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,683
No way.

691
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:31,203
I should have known.

692
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:34,738
Why would anyone like her
wanna be with someone like me?

693
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,440
Hey, what are you talking about?

694
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,458
He's right.

695
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:41,343
Who's right?

696
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,031
- Richard.
- Oh, no, no.

697
00:55:43,033 --> 00:55:44,758
- He's always been right.
- Hold on.

698
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,758
I'm just a piece of shit.

699
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,278
Hold on.

700
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,823
- It's all I am.
- No, hey,

701
00:55:51,525 --> 00:55:52,442
look at me.

702
00:55:53,768 --> 00:55:55,268
I know you're not about to believe a word

703
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:57,220
that comes out of that asshole's mouth.

704
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:01,348
He's right.

705
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:03,463
No, he's wrong, Noah.

706
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,108
When he says stuff like that,

707
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:08,368
that has nothing to do with you.

708
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:10,853
It has everything to do with him.

709
00:56:11,734 --> 00:56:13,573
Since when are you the expert?

710
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,643
Trust me, I know.

711
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:21,883
My parents were the same way.

712
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:29,433
As hard as it may seem, we
just can't believe that shit.

713
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:35,218
You gotta focus on you
and what makes you great,

714
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,923
because you are great.

715
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:39,783
Cool?

716
00:56:42,651 --> 00:56:45,318
[Noah sniffing]

717
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:50,373
What?

718
00:56:54,061 --> 00:56:55,728
It's not that weird.

719
00:56:57,706 --> 00:56:59,289
It is that weird.

720
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:02,653
A little, yeah.

721
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:07,763
Point is, Richard's a loser.

722
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,080
You're nothing like him.

723
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,073
Who?

724
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:15,023
My man.

725
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:17,841
What?

726
00:57:17,843 --> 00:57:19,408
Get away from me with all that, dude.

727
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:20,938
My mustache?

728
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:22,638
Yeah, shave it off and
then you can come back.

729
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,006
God, come give me a hug, man, at least.

730
00:57:24,008 --> 00:57:25,558
- Stop.
- Show your boy some love.

731
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,709
- Stop.
- Oh.

732
00:57:26,711 --> 00:57:29,794
[car engine roaring]

733
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:39,708
I knew it, God damn it.

734
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:41,048
I knew you were staying
at that guy's house.

735
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:42,379
[Noah] His name's Owen.

736
00:57:42,381 --> 00:57:44,168
I don't give a shit what his name is.

to happen so much harder,
