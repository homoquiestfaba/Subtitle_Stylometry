1
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,515
Oh yeah I forgot
you were here.

2
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,354
Gettin' it, huh?

3
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,689
I can't believe I just did that.

4
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:23,251
We have a mayday, mayday.

5
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:29,590
No, no, no.

6
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:30,758
I need to take a dump.

7
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,560
I need to take a piss.

8
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:33,494
All right.

9
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,295
Come on, Lane,

10
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:35,229
Laine started this,

11
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:36,164
she wants us to do
this, take the camera.

12
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:37,541
Javi, I don't care
what Laine started,

13
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:38,732
all right, man?

14
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:39,909
I don't want it, I
don't want the camera.

15
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,369
Hey Christy?

16
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:42,612
Don't go out there too
far, all right now?

17
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:43,837
Oh you worried about me?

18
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:45,406
Yeah, baby I
am, you know that.

19
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,640
I always am.

20
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:47,684
Michael grab
this camera please.

21
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:48,776
Javi, hey,

22
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:50,578
no comprende my friend,

23
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,545
don't know what
you're sayin', I'm not

24
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:54,482
taking the camera...

25
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:55,316
What's your wife up to?

26
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,185
Christy.

27
00:01:57,218 --> 00:01:58,686
Hey.

28
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:02,490
Christy...
What is it Michael?

29
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:04,925
Christy.

30
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,194
What is it Michael?

31
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:07,295
Dude, she's gone.

32
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:08,738
How can she be
gone, what do you mean?

33
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:09,763
I mean she's gone, man.

34
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,332
We were just like, we were there

35
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:12,542
and then she just disappeared.

36
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:13,834
Something got her.

37
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,169
Okay.

38
00:02:15,203 --> 00:02:15,903
Maybe there's
something on the tape.

39
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,571
We gotta find her.

40
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:18,372
Maybe something
on the tape that we missed.

41
00:02:18,406 --> 00:02:19,340
What?

42
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:20,417
On the tape...
Yeah check the

43
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:21,441
tape out, dude.

44
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:26,674
Hey.

45
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,810
What are you doin' up?

46
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:32,313
How you feelin'?

47
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:34,715
What happened?

48
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,685
How's your head?

49
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,253
Uh, stopped the
bleedin' earlier.

50
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:41,655
It's not that bad.

51
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:43,991
Not like South
Africa bad, huh?

52
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:47,595
Not even close.

53
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:48,762
How long was I out?

54
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:50,264
I don't know, 'bout

55
00:03:50,298 --> 00:03:52,566
five, six hours.

56
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,701
Where is everybody?

57
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,470
They went looking for help.

58
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:57,738
And the pilot?

59
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:58,739
He was the first one to leave.

60
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,408
He took off by himself

61
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:01,575
and he didn't look well.

62
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,744
Was he sick?

63
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:07,915
Hey look, I have

64
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,483
some aspirin in my camera bag.

65
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:10,284
Let me get you a couple.

66
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:11,352
No,

67
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,653
it's

68
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,655
okay.

69
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:19,360
Did the pilot radio for help?

70
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:20,661
He tried but

71
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:23,297
he didn't get a response.

72
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:24,965
Did he say
anything about this island?

73
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,741
I'll be back, Greg.

74
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,743
Where you goin'?

75
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,782
All right, but you be careful.

76
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,618
Those rocks look nasty.

77
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,687
Nastier than Peru?

78
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,522
No.

79
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:30,984
Are you sure?

80
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,953
Identical, Greg.

81
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:43,997
We're just gonna get a head
start right now, that's all.

82
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:49,670
Hey, are you all right?

83
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:50,938
Look, Laine,

84
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,882
why don't we just wait for the
rest of the crew to get back?

85
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,141
We could

86
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,876
but I just wanna
take a little peek.

87
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,111
Get a little head
start, come on.

88
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,081
I got a bad
feeling about this.

89
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,185
You trust me, right?

90
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:09,857
Yeah.

91
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,025
All right, so uh,

92
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:15,162
you just wanna get some cut
away and B roll stuff, right?

93
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:19,099
Oh, I hate that thing.

94
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,868
Put it in your bag.

95
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:23,003
Come on, safety first.

96
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:56,036
Hey, take it
easy on that water.

97
00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:00,708
You think the two cases
we have is gonna be enough?

98
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:03,110
We don't have a
choice right now.

99
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:06,113
Food's gonna be a bitch.

100
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,757
What is it?

101
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,126
See something?

102
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,763
It's nothing.

103
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,100
You just did all that
staring for nothing?

104
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,239
You know what I really
dislike about our job?

105
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,941
Is that no matter
how much we research

106
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:36,109
and no matter how much
knowledge we have,

107
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:38,779
we always find out how
little we researched

108
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:41,649
and how much knowledge
we don't have.

109
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,083
That's the fun part.

110
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,218
Oh yeah.

111
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:55,929
Do you see that?

112
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,903
You know these
cats aren't rare,

113
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,839
but the fact that they're
on this island is.

114
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:07,150
We just need to take the
precautionary measures

115
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:08,742
that we would normally take.

116
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:09,843
Mm.

117
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:12,179
Like the one in Guadalajara?

118
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:13,814
That wasn't my fault.

119
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:14,982
What?

120
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,650
You're crazy.

121
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:18,085
I couldn't feel my left arm for

122
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,387
two days.

123
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,922
You should've seen Michael

124
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,023
when we got back home.

125
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:26,192
That was funny.

126
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:42,009
Man, I'm hungry.

127
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:42,943
I can't wait to get
back to the plane

128
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:46,113
and get in my beef
jerky that's in there.

129
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,948
There's food on the plane?

130
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:48,916
Well, just some snacks.

131
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:49,416
Not much.

132
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:50,884
That's all?

133
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:53,921
Didn't plan on crashin'.

134
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,834
How good is the
mic on the camera?

135
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,175
This is the moment.

136
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,710
A moment of discovery.

137
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:18,912
A moment of wonder.

138
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:24,217
This is the moment that
will now be revealed

139
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:25,152
but remember,

140
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,920
if you want the moment to last,

141
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:28,856
it's still a perception.

142
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:30,157
Discovery,

143
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,092
wonder,

144
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,861
maybe nothing.

145
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:35,929
Let's find out.

146
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,478
Laine.

147
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,114
Did you see it?

148
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,482
See what?

149
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,822
This is not a good way to
start a project, Laine.

150
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,123
I mean, the plane crashin'.

151
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,167
It's only an ankle sprain.

152
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:05,225
Where's your camera?

153
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:06,226
What?

154
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:09,262
Where's your camera?

155
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:11,164
Come on, you know the rules.

156
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:12,800
Rules haven't changed.

157
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,769
Seven years, seven.

158
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:55,208
It's that feeling I get.

159
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:58,145
It's that same old feeling.

160
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:58,912
Now you know I trust you,

161
00:12:58,946 --> 00:12:59,880
it's not that

162
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:00,547
but every time I feel like this,

163
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,149
somethin' happens.

164
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:03,192
Did the crew ever
mention what time they

165
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,853
were coming back?

166
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,290
So how many days do we
have left with food?

167
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:13,927
Not many.

168
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,097
The pilot has a crate of beans

169
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,099
in the back of his plane.

170
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,068
I got my snacks, but
that's not a lot.

171
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:23,303
It's what, beef
jerky, some chips,

172
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,805
crackers.

173
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:31,144
The others take some food?

174
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:33,246
Very little.

175
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,587
All right.

176
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,222
I'm gonna go plan
my shot list for our

177
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:45,158
next round in the
jungle tomorrow.

178
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,396
Cool.

179
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,200
I'm gonna hit the
hay right now but um,

180
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,201
first I'm gonna
review the tapes,

181
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:56,937
make sure they're not damaged.

182
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:17,424
I'm working.

183
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:24,164
Okay, okay, okay.

184
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,136
My name

185
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,304
is Javier Nunez

186
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:32,239
and I

187
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:34,407
am the key grip,

188
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:38,478
gaffer and sometimes

189
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:42,049
I do Craft services
for the team.

190
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:43,583
Okay, how's that?

191
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,919
Am I done now?

192
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:47,254
We're good?

193
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,228
This is my truck.

194
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:57,364
I'm not an actor.

195
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:06,239
Hm, vulnerabilities.

196
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:09,042
Here's my vulnerability.

197
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,248
How's that, Greg, you like that?

198
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:16,984
And my strength,

199
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,523
yeah.

200
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:28,996
And when it does,

201
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,339
I'm gonna buy that
wife of mine that house

202
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:33,066
she's always wanted.

203
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,634
I love you, baby.

204
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,004
Black jaguars,

205
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:39,439
here we come.

206
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:57,290
You scared?

207
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:02,462
You know, you shouldn't be.

208
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:05,465
Jaguars don't like fire.

209
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,469
Nah, it's not that.

210
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,671
It's just, I've been freezing
my ass off every night

211
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,407
and I can't sleep.

212
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,413
Take a drink.

213
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:23,550
It'll warm you up
and put you to sleep.

214
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:28,221
That stuff actually
helped my headache.

215
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,326
Ah.

216
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:41,234
You don't sleep
in the nude, do you?

217
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:43,603
Not unless you want me to.

218
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:48,375
Goodnight, Greg.

219
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:50,410
Goodnight.

220
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:52,679
Yo, Laine.

221
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,581
Hm?

222
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,483
I'm sorry about today.

223
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,351
I mean with the
camera and all that.

224
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:01,121
It won't happen again.

225
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:04,524
Thank you.

226
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:09,396
And thanks for
saving our lives.

227
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:29,816
Ah.

228
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,432
Mayday, mayday, this is 201,

229
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:20,700
can you read me?

230
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:23,636
Over.

231
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:34,847
This is 201, can
you read me now?

232
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,849
Over.

233
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,566
This is,

234
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,802
Nancy 201, Jackson Mary,

235
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:58,538
I repeat this is Nancy
201, Jackson Mary.

236
00:18:58,571 --> 00:18:59,706
We have an S.O.S., mayday,

237
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:02,642
our plane has gone
down, do you copy that?

238
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:07,814
Yes, very, coordinates...

239
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,861
I don't have our
exact coordinates.

240
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:25,332
We're somewhere off
of Gabriola Island.

241
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,334
I repeat we are somewhere
off of Gabriola Island,

242
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:28,701
do you copy that?

243
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:33,740
Yeah, Mary,

244
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,442
and we should be there shortly.

245
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,844
Over.

246
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:40,713
Do you copy?

247
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,717
Copy that.

248
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:55,828
What are you doin'?

249
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,265
No,

250
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:01,601
you did not just talk
to someone on the radio.

251
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:05,872
They'll be here shortly.

252
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,675
Nice, nice.

253
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,778
At least you learned
something from Jeff.

254
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:18,518
I'm sorry.

255
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,720
Don't be.

256
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,655
Let's get to working.

257
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:25,792
We don't have a lot of time.

258
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:32,665
Extinction comes to all.

259
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:45,745
You still have
that feeling today?

260
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:48,781
I'll be all right.

261
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:52,752
You know, I think we
have something here, Greg.

262
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:54,421
Something special.

263
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:57,724
I trust you.

264
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,692
Okay let's go.

265
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:01,328
Oh,

266
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:03,763
hold on.

267
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,064
What are you doing?

268
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:07,700
Bum knee.

269
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:11,304
Old high school football injury.

270
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:14,574
You never played football.

271
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,609
'93 marching band.

272
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:19,412
I accidentally got tackled.

273
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,884
You know, Laine,

274
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:27,487
what if our producers
got it wrong?

275
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,821
I mean,

276
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:31,891
what if what's out here
isn't really a jaguar?

277
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:32,859
I mean,

278
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:33,793
you yourself said,

279
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:36,095
"How would they get here?"

280
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,565
Then what is it?

281
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:39,999
I don't know.

282
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:43,736
Maybe some like new
breed or something.

283
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,705
Could be.

284
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:49,075
I mean living in this
ecosystem can change an animal.

285
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:52,779
Especially if it's not the
normal habitat they're used to.

286
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:56,892
How much more
footage of these trees

287
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,085
you want me to get?

288
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:05,892
You know, I
saw something earlier.

289
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,796
Eyes.

290
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,865
Saw a pair of eyes.

291
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:15,368
Eyes?

292
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:17,570
Yeah, but there was
something different about them.

293
00:22:17,604 --> 00:22:19,839
Something intelligent.

294
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,874
Something,

295
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:25,712
I don't know.

296
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:26,755
We just need to be careful.

297
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:27,890
No, no, no, wait a minute,

298
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:28,881
wait a minute, wait a minute.

299
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:29,816
You can't freak me out
with a story like that

300
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,785
and end it with, "We
need to be careful."

301
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:34,587
We are always careful, Laine,

302
00:22:34,621 --> 00:22:36,155
but for you to say it,

303
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,724
okay, now I'm worried.

304
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:38,991
Why?

305
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,727
Instincts,

306
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,430
instincts.

307
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:45,398
Follow it, follow it.

308
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:46,666
Wait, wait,

309
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,535
wait.

310
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:54,907
Laine,

311
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:55,875
Laine, wait a minute.

312
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:57,810
You can't just take
off and run like that,

313
00:22:57,844 --> 00:22:58,878
you oh,

314
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:00,813
god.

315
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,853
What could've done this?

316
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:12,058
This isn't a jaguar, Greg.

317
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:15,828
Then what is it?

318
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:24,771
This is a family of jaguars.

319
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:29,075
Um,

320
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:31,878
let's head back, all right?

321
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,814
The rest of the crew's
probably waiting for us.

322
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:36,616
Come on, Laine.

323
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,585
Laine.

324
00:23:56,703 --> 00:23:59,506
I'm just worried, that's all.

325
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,975
Maybe they're already saved.

326
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:04,677
I mean,

327
00:24:04,711 --> 00:24:06,646
them getting saved
and finding us

328
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:09,982
can be the difference
of a day or two.

329
00:24:10,016 --> 00:24:11,984
They're coming for us.

330
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:14,754
Soon.

331
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:19,926
Look,

332
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,994
I don't wanna sound
like a pussy or anything

333
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:23,663
because we've been
in worse situations

334
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:26,999
and in nastier places than this

335
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:29,769
but I feel naked out here.

336
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,270
Sounds funny, but

337
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,940
I don't feel equipped.

338
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,277
It's just because we didn't
prepare for this, Greg.

339
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,847
We're good, though.

340
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,884
Believe it or not,
we're not that bad off.

341
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:48,821
Can I tell you
something about Jeff?

342
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:52,792
Will it make you feel better?

343
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:57,764
He said no one
could make Laine happy.

344
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:03,536
What does that have to
do with our situation?

345
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,772
Nothing, it just

346
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:08,741
stuck in my head, that's all.

347
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:14,246
So,

348
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,950
what do you think about
those guts on that rock?

349
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:20,963
You know, I'm not
afraid to talk about him

350
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:24,256
if that's what you
wanted to know.

351
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:27,927
Do you wanna talk
about the divorce?

352
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,697
Let's just talk
about the jaguar.

353
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:33,966
Do you think they
led us to that rock?

354
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,901
I mean, I don't know
if they're capable

355
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:37,269
of doin' something like that but

356
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:41,040
somethin' tells me they
wanted us to see that.

357
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:43,242
Those cats are cunning.

358
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:46,345
Smart.

359
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,048
Maybe.

360
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:52,619
Let's go back
tomorrow and find out.

361
00:25:57,023 --> 00:25:59,325
Then it's a date.

362
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,864
I'm gonna go get
something to show you.

363
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,133
I'll be right back.

364
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:25,852
What the hell is your problem?

365
00:26:25,885 --> 00:26:28,254
Did you see the others?

366
00:26:30,356 --> 00:26:33,793
Maybe, maybe not.

367
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:02,381
I don't see anything.

368
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:05,785
Is this the right spot?

369
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:09,221
What happened?

370
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:11,690
I don't know.

371
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:22,034
I want a shot of those trees

372
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:23,002
and then I want you to come down

373
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,271
and follow it to where
the blood trails were at

374
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:27,940
and stop at the rock.

375
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:29,985
I'm gonna squat down in frame,

376
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:33,212
say my little thing and
then exit into the jungle.

377
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:37,183
Hey,

378
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,326
let's not stop until
we get something

379
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,219
to take back home with us.

380
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:43,155
Something good.

381
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:53,800
Yesterday it looked
like a bloody massacre.

382
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:57,169
Today just an eerie aftermath.

383
00:28:57,203 --> 00:29:01,207
A sequel that leaves even
more unanswered questions.

384
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:06,145
Somewhere out there
lies the truth.

385
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:09,181
Explanations to
questions that maybe,

386
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:12,351
just maybe, should
be left unanswered.

387
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:16,956
Let's stop asking questions.

388
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:22,570
All right that was
good, I think we got it.

389
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,796
Let's get back.

390
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:49,221
Anything else?

391
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:53,601
It was probably just the wind.

392
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,393
I'll, I'll get some rope,

393
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:56,062
I'll tie it down,

394
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:57,272
don't worry, I'll
take care of it.

395
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,098
I need this, Greg.

396
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,200
We need this.

397
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:03,369
It was just the battery.

398
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:06,472
I can't afford another loss.

399
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:08,207
You're Laine Wells.

400
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,109
With your name and reputation,

401
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,210
backing's not a problem,

402
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:13,913
distribution's not an issue.

403
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:16,282
Look, listen to me,

404
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,316
once we're rescued,

405
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:18,885
we'll regroup with the others,

406
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:20,887
we'll fly back here and

407
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,490
get all the pick
ups that you need.

408
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:26,025
You know our producers will

409
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:29,261
give us the budget
and the extension.

410
00:30:29,295 --> 00:30:31,330
But we lost money
on the last two films.

411
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:32,264
This...

412
00:30:32,298 --> 00:30:34,233
Don't even think about those.

413
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:37,536
I need you to focus on this one.

414
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:46,212
Laine, you've never let me down.

415
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,020
How many batteries
do we have left?

416
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:57,389
Um, I just have
a couple, like,

417
00:30:57,423 --> 00:30:59,391
can always charge them
in the plane, but,

418
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:01,560
but I'll have to use
the plane juices.

419
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,429
The small generator, the gear,

420
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:04,639
I sent it with the plane that's

421
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:07,466
probably already at Gabriola.

422
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:12,438
Where's the pilot?

423
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,341
He's not there?

424
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,276
John Andrew?

425
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:19,979
Hey, John Andrew.

426
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:22,314
He's probably out drinking.

427
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:23,549
Yeah, probably.

428
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:24,483
I mean where'd
you find that guy?

429
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:27,286
He couldn't be our only choice.

430
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:32,424
He was our only choice?

431
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,226
Yes.

432
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,962
Because of um,

433
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:37,129
time or budget?

434
00:31:37,163 --> 00:31:39,331
Both.

435
00:31:42,368 --> 00:31:44,570
Forget about it.

436
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:47,239
I trust you.

437
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:58,417
Gettin' that, huh?

438
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,222
Oh,

439
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:06,158
you mean like this?

440
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,396
Oh god.

441
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,565
I can't believe I just did that.

442
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,001
What you doin'?

443
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:18,270
I just showed my boobs.

444
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:20,406
Let me see.

445
00:32:27,013 --> 00:32:29,215
Oh yeah, I forgot
you were here.

446
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:30,049
So what's goin' on?

447
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:30,983
What are we doin'?

448
00:32:31,017 --> 00:32:33,385
Greg, I'm not really a very good

449
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:35,121
on the spot talker,
you know that.

450
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:36,322
I'm a sound guy.

451
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:39,425
I am uh,

452
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:43,329
one of the fantastic five

453
00:32:43,362 --> 00:32:45,197
on team Cinema Verde

454
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:47,333
original uh,

455
00:32:47,366 --> 00:32:48,400
members assembled uh,

456
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:50,636
back at Cal State

457
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:52,604
University North Ridge.

458
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:53,672
Whoa, sea sign.

459
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:56,108
Whoo hoo, sea sign, yeah.

460
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:56,675
Um,

461
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,044
I don't,

462
00:32:58,077 --> 00:33:00,379
I don't know what to say.

463
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:04,416
Come on, tell 'em, why
don't you just tell 'em?

464
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:07,786
Okay.

465
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,622
That's not all I do.

466
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,758
I'm also production manager

467
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:14,760
and accountant

468
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:17,396
and

469
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:19,065
I

470
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:20,066
Have a big pimple on my face

471
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:21,376
and I would really appreciate it

472
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,402
if you got that
camera out of there.

473
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:25,171
That's all I have to say.

474
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:26,772
So,

475
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:29,275
honey.

476
00:33:29,308 --> 00:33:31,119
Why don't you get us
when we're drunk or like,

477
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:32,411
when we're movin' around.

478
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:33,812
Uh,

479
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,481
it'll be a lot...

480
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,259
Honey, I'm just warning
you, Greg's out here.

481
00:33:37,283 --> 00:33:38,050
Huh?

482
00:33:38,084 --> 00:33:39,618
He's out here again.

483
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,789
Let's just give
him what he wants.

484
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:48,094
Okay, well I'm not addicted
to the pain killers anymore

485
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:51,430
and in two months I'm gonna
give one of my kidneys

486
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:53,765
to my sister

487
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:57,203
and I love my wife very deeply.

488
00:33:57,236 --> 00:33:58,604
Ooh.

489
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:00,806
And I love my husband

490
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:01,773
and I love

491
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:03,442
my new boobs.

492
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:04,576
Whoo.

493
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,378
Oh, why do I always do that?

494
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:09,448
She bought those
a long time ago.

495
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:34,140
Greg.

496
00:34:34,173 --> 00:34:36,542
Greg is that you?

497
00:35:06,205 --> 00:35:07,573
Can I help you?

498
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:10,609
Were you just
throwing rocks at me?

499
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:13,512
Why, should I?

500
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:17,649
Why didn't you tell
me you were sick?

501
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:22,321
I knew.

502
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:24,590
You could've killed us.

503
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:25,491
Are you hearing me?

504
00:35:25,524 --> 00:35:26,625
You could've killed us.

505
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:28,260
I'm grounded, I was suspended.

506
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:31,330
You knew that when
you came to me.

507
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:32,864
Remember saying, "Hey John",

508
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:35,501
don't tell 'em I could."

509
00:35:35,534 --> 00:35:37,469
Remember that?

510
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:39,481
Yeah well, I didn't know
that you were drunk that day.

511
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:40,506
Drunk.

512
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:42,941
You thought I had
speech problems?

513
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,277
Hey, hey, what's
going on guys?

514
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:47,679
Nothing.

515
00:35:47,713 --> 00:35:50,148
It's nothing.

516
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,385
Hey John,

517
00:35:53,419 --> 00:35:56,788
do you know anything
about Gabriola?

518
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:57,956
Yellow.

519
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,492
Carbs and high in fiber.

520
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:01,427
No, Gabriola the island,

521
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,704
I'm trying to figure
out where we're at.

522
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:03,838
Oh, I don't even remember...

523
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:05,540
When I talked to the
rescuers on the radio earlier,

524
00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:08,400
they said they'd
be here shortly.

525
00:36:08,434 --> 00:36:11,437
Why does it seem like they're
having trouble finding us?

526
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:12,514
Yeah, John, I mean,
why don't you call 'em,

527
00:36:12,538 --> 00:36:13,639
tell 'em where we're at,

528
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,974
it's not like they can't
see the plane from the sky.

529
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,809
I think there's a
reason why I can't answer

530
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:18,944
your questions, right?

531
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:19,978
Why?

532
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,713
Ask your boss.

533
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:23,782
What's that supposed to mean?

534
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:24,716
What the hell is your problem?

535
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:25,651
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

536
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:26,618
John, John, please, please.

537
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:29,488
Hey, Laine, please.

538
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:34,760
Come on, come on.

539
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:37,896
What's that all about, huh?

540
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:38,973
Dang, girl, you
been working out,

541
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:41,300
you're a beast, look at that.

542
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:42,534
Girl, you got muscles.

543
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:48,740
Help!

544
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:52,244
Hey.

545
00:36:52,278 --> 00:36:53,745
Hey...
Help!

546
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:54,913
Hey!

547
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:56,582
Help!

548
00:36:56,615 --> 00:36:59,385
Hey!

549
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:38,690
Rescue team should've
been here by now, huh?

550
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,297
I'm going to take your advice.

551
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:47,065
We can wait on the footage.

552
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,302
I think we should
look for the others.

553
00:37:50,336 --> 00:37:53,672
I mean we should at least
check the southwest parts.

554
00:38:00,346 --> 00:38:02,981
Can I ask you something?

555
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:08,420
How come you never talk
about your divorce?

556
00:38:08,454 --> 00:38:11,690
'Cause I don't really
think I ever had a marriage.

557
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:17,095
I liked Jeff, you know?

558
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,997
I mean,

559
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,500
before.

560
00:38:22,768 --> 00:38:24,803
He was like,

561
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:25,904
one of those

562
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:28,073
perfect good looking guys
you just wanted to hate

563
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:31,009
but you couldn't.

564
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,811
I could.

565
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:40,652
I don't blame him
for cheating on me.

566
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:41,687
No, no, no, no.

567
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,390
Nobody deserves that.

568
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:47,092
Yeah well some people do.

569
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:55,934
Did you ever wonder,

570
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,139
you know um,

571
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,610
we should maybe get some rest.

572
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,820
You ever think we'd
make a good couple?

573
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:22,027
I don't know.

574
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,564
Maybe.

575
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:30,702
Maybe not.

576
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,708
Goodnight, Laine.

577
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,878
Goodnight.

578
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:07,999
Michael!

579
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:10,536
Christy!

580
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:13,939
Javi!

581
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:19,010
Michael!

582
00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:21,713
Christy!

583
00:41:21,747 --> 00:41:23,749
Jav!

584
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:43,134
Michael!

585
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,605
Christy!

586
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:48,640
Laine!

587
00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:34,786
Laine!

588
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:37,656
Laine!

589
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,226
Laine!

590
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,328
Laine, whoa, whoa, whoa,

591
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:44,129
whoa, Laine,

592
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:45,296
Laine, it's okay,

593
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:47,132
it's okay, you're safe now.

594
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:48,199
You're safe, I'm here.

595
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:50,168
It's okay.

596
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:53,739
What happened?

597
00:42:53,772 --> 00:42:54,840
They were chasing me.

598
00:42:54,873 --> 00:42:56,808
What?

599
00:42:59,645 --> 00:43:01,880
Are you okay?

600
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,852
I need a drink.

601
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:08,720
Let's uh,

602
00:43:08,754 --> 00:43:11,089
let's get back to camp.

603
00:43:12,357 --> 00:43:13,391
Whoa.

604
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,927
What's wrong?

605
00:43:20,398 --> 00:43:21,733
Greg?

606
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:23,068
It's okay.

607
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,904
They would've killed me.

608
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:33,311
Did you see what
they looked like?

609
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:36,247
No, but I could
hear them breathing.

610
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:40,852
I nearly saw it.

611
00:43:40,886 --> 00:43:42,053
The growling.

612
00:43:42,087 --> 00:43:44,823
They were that close?

613
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:48,994
I could smell them.

614
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:55,934
Greg,

615
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,102
they're toying with us.

616
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:58,303
Yeah, let's um,

617
00:43:58,336 --> 00:44:00,138
let's get back to camp.

618
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:02,007
Okay?

619
00:44:20,025 --> 00:44:23,161
I couldn't find him anywhere.

620
00:44:23,194 --> 00:44:25,096
Who cares?

621
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:28,299
He's a big boy, he can
take care of himself.

622
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:31,970
Here.

623
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:34,205
Take one for the team.

624
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:38,343
Come on.

625
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,345
Nice.

626
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:42,814
Ugh.

627
00:44:42,848 --> 00:44:44,449
Okay, this one.

628
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:49,287
Here's to

629
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,790
not being rescued.

630
00:45:03,168 --> 00:45:05,070
Do we have any more food?

631
00:45:05,103 --> 00:45:07,839
'Cause I'm kinda hungry.

632
00:45:07,873 --> 00:45:09,841
Not for tonight.

633
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:12,110
We only have enough
for two more meals, so,

634
00:45:12,143 --> 00:45:14,712
I'll give you something
in the morning.

635
00:45:20,185 --> 00:45:23,054
You think the others are okay?

636
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,194
What are you looking at?

637
00:45:31,096 --> 00:45:32,964
Nothing.

638
00:45:32,998 --> 00:45:35,000
No, yeah, they're
fine, they're fine.

639
00:45:35,033 --> 00:45:35,767
I mean,

640
00:45:35,801 --> 00:45:37,002
come on,

641
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:38,079
big Javier, who's
gonna mess with him?

642
00:45:38,103 --> 00:45:39,771
And you know Michael.

643
00:45:39,805 --> 00:45:42,207
Oh yeah, Michael.

644
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,243
He's a wilderness
guy, all right.

645
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:49,815
You're crazy.

646
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:57,122
Hey look.

647
00:45:57,155 --> 00:45:58,389
I found it in the airplane

648
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:00,491
when you were looking for John.

649
00:46:00,525 --> 00:46:01,292
Hm.

650
00:46:01,326 --> 00:46:04,262
Batteries are old, but

651
00:46:04,295 --> 00:46:07,498
it might last us
through the night.

652
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,970
Later on we could turn it up.

653
00:46:12,003 --> 00:46:15,506
You know those
kitties hate noise.

654
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,108
Oh hey, about that, you know,

655
00:46:17,142 --> 00:46:20,045
I'm really sorry I
didn't get to you fast...

656
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:33,191
Are you still in love with Jeff?

657
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:40,098
I divorced him.

658
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:43,101
Are you still
in love with him?

659
00:46:45,436 --> 00:46:49,174
Did you know I took belly
dancing classes for him?

660
00:46:50,175 --> 00:46:52,143
Yeah.

661
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,914
How?

662
00:46:55,947 --> 00:46:58,283
Did he tell you?

663
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:02,120
No, actually, I told him.

664
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:05,190
Remember that job
we did in Hawaii?

665
00:47:06,391 --> 00:47:09,194
Afterwards, you guys
had a few drinks and

666
00:47:09,227 --> 00:47:12,030
you started to dance for him.

667
00:47:12,063 --> 00:47:14,332
He passed out.

668
00:47:14,365 --> 00:47:17,235
I saw you from my bungalow.

669
00:47:19,304 --> 00:47:22,874
So I suggested it to
him in the morning.

670
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:29,480
Well then it's
only fitting that I

671
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:32,951
give you the first one.

672
00:47:32,984 --> 00:47:34,920
You never danced for him?

673
00:47:36,121 --> 00:47:37,588
No.

674
00:47:47,265 --> 00:47:50,301
That ugly pilot
isn't around is he?

675
00:47:50,335 --> 00:47:52,203
No.

676
00:47:54,272 --> 00:47:55,440
Oh my god, I can't believe

677
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:57,575
I'm gonna do this.

678
00:48:00,345 --> 00:48:02,213
Okay.

679
00:48:02,247 --> 00:48:04,249
All right.

680
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:57,355
I hope we get off
this island soon.

681
00:50:57,388 --> 00:51:00,525
Get a search party and
come back for our friends.

682
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:04,595
I'm gonna get back
on the radio later.

683
00:51:04,629 --> 00:51:07,665
Maybe they're close
to finding us.

684
00:51:09,267 --> 00:51:11,602
You know you
hurt me last night.

685
00:51:11,636 --> 00:51:13,638
What?

686
00:51:14,505 --> 00:51:16,374
Yeah.

687
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:17,242
When you laid me on my back

688
00:51:17,275 --> 00:51:19,677
and you got on top
of me and rode me,

689
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:21,546
got a rock in my butt.

690
00:51:25,516 --> 00:51:27,452
See that's what
I'm talking about.

691
00:51:27,485 --> 00:51:30,421
Laughter.

692
00:51:30,455 --> 00:51:33,724
We have to keep
each other smiling.

693
00:51:37,295 --> 00:51:40,331
What's the difference
between a white owl

694
00:51:40,365 --> 00:51:43,168
and a black owl?

695
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:46,771
A white owl goes,

696
00:51:46,804 --> 00:51:49,474
hoo, hoo.

697
00:51:49,507 --> 00:51:50,508
A black owl goes,

698
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:52,677
who dat, who dat?

699
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:58,649
It's not good.

700
00:51:59,684 --> 00:52:01,186
All right,

701
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:01,786
my turn.

702
00:52:01,819 --> 00:52:04,222
Oh, I gotta hear this.

703
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:08,393
Um, okay.

704
00:52:08,426 --> 00:52:11,529
How does a blonde part her hair?

705
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,505
You're crazy.

706
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:22,640
You are crazy.

707
00:52:22,673 --> 00:52:23,708
See,

708
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:25,710
I can be loose.
Yeah,

709
00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:26,677
yeah, I know,

710
00:52:26,711 --> 00:52:27,912
I know.

711
00:52:27,945 --> 00:52:29,323
It's nice to see you
smiling like that.

712
00:52:29,347 --> 00:52:31,549
I haven't seen that
in a long time.

713
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:33,418
Yeah.

714
00:52:36,321 --> 00:52:39,156
You know I meant
what I said last night.

715
00:52:40,258 --> 00:52:42,493
Which part, the uh,

716
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:47,598
or the um,

717
00:52:47,632 --> 00:52:50,201
"Goodnight Laine."

718
00:52:50,235 --> 00:52:50,735
No.

719
00:52:50,768 --> 00:52:52,837
Yes.

720
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:55,706
When I said that
I can make you...

721
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:56,841
I,

722
00:52:58,309 --> 00:53:00,445
I know you can.

723
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,353
Gunshot?

724
00:53:08,386 --> 00:53:10,755
John Andrew has a gun.

725
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:24,635
John is that you?

726
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,675
Greg come here.

727
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:36,781
Holy shit.

728
00:53:36,814 --> 00:53:39,684
John Andrew what are you doin'?

729
00:53:41,286 --> 00:53:43,721
What's wrong?

730
00:53:43,754 --> 00:53:44,722
Hey what's wrong?

731
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:46,624
Did you see something?

732
00:53:46,657 --> 00:53:48,459
I saw a body.

733
00:53:48,493 --> 00:53:50,461
A girl's body.

734
00:53:52,997 --> 00:53:54,832
Where?

735
00:53:54,865 --> 00:53:56,367
About 20 yards

736
00:53:56,401 --> 00:53:58,569
down that way.

737
00:53:59,504 --> 00:54:01,972
We have to go check it out.

738
00:54:24,562 --> 00:54:25,696
I shot one,

739
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:28,032
it was by the body.

740
00:54:44,749 --> 00:54:45,926
Will you help
me take Christy's

741
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:48,486
body back to camp?

742
00:54:57,462 --> 00:54:59,564
Have you seen my
wife's purple shoes?

743
00:55:04,435 --> 00:55:05,803
Okay, well that's easy because

744
00:55:05,836 --> 00:55:07,638
there's nothing bad
to say about Laine.

745
00:55:07,672 --> 00:55:08,806
Oh get out...
Come on.

746
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:10,841
Baby, we're all gonna say it.

747
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:12,018
You're not
gettin' off that easy.

748
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:12,810
Come on.

749
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:13,744
Okay, okay, fine.

750
00:55:13,778 --> 00:55:14,945
If there's

751
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:16,847
one thing that's
bad to say about

752
00:55:16,881 --> 00:55:19,550
Laine is that,

753
00:55:19,584 --> 00:55:20,751
sometimes

754
00:55:20,785 --> 00:55:22,620
she's too ambitious.

755
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:23,588
I think everybody thinks that.

756
00:55:23,621 --> 00:55:28,593
She's a little over
the top ambitious-wise

757
00:55:28,626 --> 00:55:29,560
but that can be a good thing,

758
00:55:29,594 --> 00:55:30,495
but it's just, you know,

759
00:55:30,528 --> 00:55:32,763
I personally, I'm

760
00:55:32,797 --> 00:55:33,864
not that way and

761
00:55:33,898 --> 00:55:36,634
I don't know, anyway um,

762
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,102
so, Javier,

763
00:55:38,135 --> 00:55:41,739
I think it's your turn next.

764
00:55:41,772 --> 00:55:45,776
Well, I'm gonna keep
it short and sweet.

765
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:48,513
I love Laine.

766
00:55:48,546 --> 00:55:50,715
The greatest thing
about her is that

767
00:55:50,748 --> 00:55:52,683
I met my wife through her.

768
00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:54,018
Aw.

769
00:55:54,051 --> 00:55:56,387
I love you baby.

770
00:55:56,421 --> 00:55:57,731
Um, she has very
strong convictions.

771
00:55:57,755 --> 00:55:59,590
Like if she sets
ff to do something,

772
00:55:59,624 --> 00:56:00,725
it's gonna get done.

773
00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:01,992
Um, with our help of course.

774
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:03,728
She's very uh,

775
00:56:03,761 --> 00:56:05,530
trustworthy

776
00:56:05,563 --> 00:56:07,164
and truthful, well trustworthy.

777
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,533
I'll go with trustworthy, yes.

778
00:56:08,566 --> 00:56:09,643
Those are good things, right?

779
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:10,568
Yup.

780
00:56:10,601 --> 00:56:11,802
Those are good.

781
00:56:20,945 --> 00:56:22,980
What am I
going to tell her family?

782
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:25,583
I mean, what about
the rest of them?

783
00:56:25,616 --> 00:56:26,451
Where's the rescue team at?

784
00:56:26,484 --> 00:56:27,885
Where's the help?

785
00:56:27,918 --> 00:56:29,820
I don't know.

786
00:56:29,854 --> 00:56:32,122
I don't know.

787
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:39,630
Bad news.

788
00:56:39,664 --> 00:56:41,499
Help ain't coming.

789
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:45,169
What do you mean
help ain't coming?

790
00:56:45,202 --> 00:56:47,872
They having
difficulty find us.

791
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:49,115
What do you mean
difficulty finding us?

792
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:51,041
We're near Gabriola Island.

793
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:54,845
I'm not sure we're
around Gabriola Islands.

794
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:59,049
I think we might be uncharted.

795
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:01,151
Uncharted?

796
00:57:01,185 --> 00:57:04,154
Doesn't mean
they can't spot us.

797
00:57:04,188 --> 00:57:05,556
They can

798
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:08,092
rescue us in few
hours or a few days.

799
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:08,826
Days?

800
00:57:08,859 --> 00:57:10,928
Days.

801
00:57:18,736 --> 00:57:19,976
On the tape...
Yeah check the

802
00:57:20,004 --> 00:57:21,739
tape out dude.

803
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,207
Wait,

804
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,208
did you hear that?

805
00:57:24,241 --> 00:57:25,142
What?

806
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:25,943
Michael did you hear that?

807
00:57:25,976 --> 00:57:27,177
What?

808
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:28,646
Come on Michael, this is it.

809
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:30,056
Javier, wait
a minute, wait a minute.

810
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,517
Let's move.
Dude, hang on.

811
00:57:33,684 --> 00:57:35,753
Javier!

812
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:37,522
Man.

813
00:57:38,656 --> 00:57:40,525
Michael!

814
00:57:40,558 --> 00:57:41,125
Javier!

815
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:41,926
Michael!

816
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,093
Javier!

817
00:58:15,926 --> 00:58:17,227
Oh my god.

818
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:19,229
They're coming for me.

819
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:23,133
They got Christy, oh my
god, it's right behind me.

820
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:25,903
Somebody help me.

821
00:58:25,936 --> 00:58:28,639
Somebody help me.

822
00:58:32,743 --> 00:58:33,611
No!

823
00:58:33,644 --> 00:58:38,015
No god no!

824
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:50,327
Laine!

825
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,629
Laine!

826
00:58:51,662 --> 00:58:53,964
No!

827
00:58:53,998 --> 00:58:54,999
They took her.

828
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:57,101
Son of a bitch.

829
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,108
I'll be back.

830
00:59:04,141 --> 00:59:05,976
I'm going with you.

831
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:06,877
Me too.

832
00:59:06,911 --> 00:59:07,845
No,

833
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:10,881
okay what if help comes?

834
00:59:10,915 --> 00:59:13,984
Stay in the plane
and lock the door.

835
00:59:16,086 --> 00:59:18,022
Let's go.

836
00:59:28,365 --> 00:59:29,266
This is it.

837
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:30,635
It's as far as we can go.

838
00:59:30,668 --> 00:59:32,236
What?

839
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:34,104
Well maybe a mile
or a mile and a half.

840
00:59:34,138 --> 00:59:36,073
That's it...
Come on, John.

841
00:59:36,106 --> 00:59:39,109
I need to find my friend's body.

842
00:59:39,143 --> 00:59:43,047
I don't know what's
beyond this point, Greg.

843
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,382
I need to find Christy.

844
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:48,653
You may not like
what you find.

845
01:00:21,919 --> 01:00:23,954
Think my other
friends are still alive?

846
01:00:23,988 --> 01:00:25,189
Let's hope.

847
01:00:25,222 --> 01:00:28,225
Not the answer
I was lookin' for.

848
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:32,162
So how'd you get a
name like John Andrew?

849
01:00:32,196 --> 01:00:34,198
Born Andres Gregorio.

850
01:00:34,231 --> 01:00:36,633
Huh, yeah.

851
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:45,676
Long time ago,

852
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:46,911
I heard something.

853
01:00:46,944 --> 01:00:48,145
Things about the islands

854
01:00:48,178 --> 01:00:50,180
on the Gulf of Mexico.

855
01:00:50,214 --> 01:00:51,415
What kinda things?

856
01:00:51,448 --> 01:00:54,151
Things you don't wanna know.

857
01:00:55,753 --> 01:00:58,022
Great.

858
01:00:58,055 --> 01:01:00,224
That girlfriend of yours
is a real piece of work.

859
01:01:00,257 --> 01:01:02,159
Oh she's not my,

860
01:01:02,192 --> 01:01:03,694
my girlfriend.

861
01:01:03,728 --> 01:01:06,130
I used to have one like that.

862
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:07,031
Back in the days.

863
01:01:07,064 --> 01:01:07,898
Yeah?

864
01:01:07,932 --> 01:01:08,833
What happened?

865
01:01:08,866 --> 01:01:11,201
This what happened.

866
01:01:14,304 --> 01:01:15,239
What do you think
our chances are

867
01:01:15,272 --> 01:01:17,908
of getting off this island?

868
01:01:19,143 --> 01:01:20,244
Fair.

869
01:01:20,277 --> 01:01:23,013
Just got to be smart.

870
01:01:36,493 --> 01:01:37,962
Greg?

871
01:01:37,995 --> 01:01:40,130
Is that you?

872
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:55,245
Do you ever feel scared?

873
01:01:55,279 --> 01:01:56,146
Me?

874
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:57,081
A guy like you?

875
01:01:57,114 --> 01:01:59,950
I'm scared right now.

876
01:02:01,786 --> 01:02:03,754
Um,

877
01:02:03,788 --> 01:02:05,355
let's uh,

878
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:06,757
let's go that way.

879
01:02:06,791 --> 01:02:09,226
Looks like there's
less stuff in our way.

880
01:02:09,259 --> 01:02:12,029
I hope you have your gun ready.

881
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:16,901
Do you really think
there's jaguars out here?

882
01:02:16,934 --> 01:02:18,936
I don't think they're jaguars.

883
01:02:19,036 --> 01:02:20,036
Then what are they?

884
01:02:49,399 --> 01:02:50,200
Open up Laine,

885
01:02:50,234 --> 01:02:52,436
open up!

886
01:02:55,339 --> 01:02:57,574
Where's John?

887
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,543
Greg, where's John?

888
01:02:59,576 --> 01:03:01,879
They got him.

889
01:03:01,912 --> 01:03:03,881
Oh fuck.

890
01:03:03,914 --> 01:03:06,851
They got him.

891
01:03:07,551 --> 01:03:09,219
Those things.

892
01:03:09,253 --> 01:03:11,255
Those beasts.

893
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:12,589
They got him.

894
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,224
They got him.

895
01:03:14,258 --> 01:03:15,325
They got him.

896
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:17,261
They got him.

897
01:03:51,996 --> 01:03:54,965
My name is Laine Wells

898
01:03:54,999 --> 01:03:57,434
and I'm the leader of,

899
01:04:04,074 --> 01:04:07,211
I'm the leader of
the Cinema Verde

900
01:04:07,244 --> 01:04:10,380
Documentary Group.

901
01:04:16,253 --> 01:04:20,157
I'm not sure what fate
has in store for me but

902
01:04:31,268 --> 01:04:35,139
should it be what I think
is going to happen then,

903
01:04:38,342 --> 01:04:42,312
I only hope that
someone finds this tape.

904
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:55,325
I was told that

905
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:03,400
no one could make me happy but

906
01:05:09,439 --> 01:05:12,109
they were wrong.

907
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:23,120
I was um,

908
01:05:24,688 --> 01:05:27,624
thinking about...

909
01:05:38,002 --> 01:05:40,170
I'm sorry.

910
01:05:43,573 --> 01:05:46,443
I'm sorry, guys.

911
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:49,746
What are you doing, Laine?

912
01:05:57,487 --> 01:05:59,523
I'm so sorry.

913
01:05:59,556 --> 01:06:00,624
What?

914
01:06:00,657 --> 01:06:02,492
I'm sorry I killed everybody.

915
01:06:02,526 --> 01:06:03,393
What?

916
01:06:03,427 --> 01:06:04,995
No, no, no, no.

917
01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:06,230
Don't, don't say that.

918
01:06:06,263 --> 01:06:09,033
Don't say that.

919
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,402
Look at me.

920
01:06:14,038 --> 01:06:16,006
Don't you quit on me, Laine.

921
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:19,476
Don't you dare quit
on me, you hear me?

922
01:06:23,513 --> 01:06:25,749
I need you.

923
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:30,387
Please don't leave me.

924
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:01,085
We can't just sit here.

925
01:07:01,118 --> 01:07:03,587
What else can we do?

926
01:07:04,821 --> 01:07:08,425
Remember in
Rio de Janeiro when

927
01:07:08,458 --> 01:07:12,196
Javier ate those
burrito looking things?

928
01:07:15,499 --> 01:07:19,469
He must've went to the
bathroom at least eight,

929
01:07:19,503 --> 01:07:22,206
10 times.

930
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:28,178
I know he stained his
underwear that day.

931
01:07:28,212 --> 01:07:31,448
Javier never wore underwear.

932
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:39,723
Rollerblading in Spain.

933
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:44,494
Remember Christy's
dress flew up?

934
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:48,798
Beaver shot.

935
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:53,270
Why doesn't anyone in
our crew wear underwear?

936
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:04,248
I'm gonna get the flare gun.

937
01:08:04,281 --> 01:08:06,616
I can't see it.

938
01:08:07,617 --> 01:08:09,186
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

939
01:08:09,219 --> 01:08:12,322
If something happens,

940
01:08:12,356 --> 01:08:14,258
you run back here
and lock that door,

941
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:16,626
you hear me?

942
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:33,810
What do we do?

943
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:34,744
I'm gonna shoot the flare.

944
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:35,545
No, no, no, wait, wait,

945
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:36,746
we only have one flare.

946
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:37,747
This is our only chance,
we might not have another one.

947
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:39,816
What if they don't see it.
What do we do?

948
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:40,617
I don't know, I don't,

949
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:41,585
let's think about it.

950
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:42,452
I'm gonna shoot the flare.

951
01:08:42,486 --> 01:08:43,486
No, no!

952
01:08:54,298 --> 01:08:56,600
I had to.

953
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:18,422
You all right?

954
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:23,159
Thank you.

955
01:09:26,763 --> 01:09:30,400
For the seven best
days of my life.

956
01:10:34,698 --> 01:10:36,466
Let's go flag it down.

957
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:38,568
I'll go.

958
01:10:40,504 --> 01:10:43,573
You stay in here.

959
01:10:43,607 --> 01:10:46,042
I'll protect you.

960
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:48,512
Promise.

961
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:04,894
Greg!

962
01:11:05,662 --> 01:11:06,930
Greg!

963
01:11:15,972 --> 01:11:18,375
Greg!

964
01:11:19,876 --> 01:11:21,845
Greg!

965
01:11:28,552 --> 01:11:30,820
Greg!

966
01:11:30,854 --> 01:11:32,522
Laine.

967
01:11:35,992 --> 01:11:38,862
Get on, no,
they're pulling you.

968
01:11:38,895 --> 01:11:39,729
Let go, Laine.

969
01:11:39,763 --> 01:11:40,530
No.

970
01:11:40,564 --> 01:11:42,466
No, let go, let go.

971
01:11:42,499 --> 01:11:44,668
Lock the door.

972
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:46,670
Lock the door.

973
01:12:35,919 --> 01:12:37,854
Oh okay.

974
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:41,758
I know that we're gonna
need a lot of luck, so,

975
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:44,894
rub my boobs for luck.

976
01:12:44,928 --> 01:12:45,595
Okay.

977
01:12:45,629 --> 01:12:46,896
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

978
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:47,664
we don't need luck, okay?

979
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:49,032
We got Laine.

980
01:12:49,065 --> 01:12:49,966
Laine,

981
01:12:49,999 --> 01:12:50,900
Greg likes you,

982
01:12:50,934 --> 01:12:51,601
he always has.

983
01:12:51,635 --> 01:12:52,602
Shut up.

984
01:12:52,636 --> 01:12:53,503
He always has.

985
01:12:53,537 --> 01:12:54,671
Don't say that.

986
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:55,848
He's just too big of a
pussy to tell you, that's all.

987
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:58,575
That's all, what, what?

988
01:14:45,749 --> 01:14:48,017
Don't move, you're
hurt pretty bad.

989
01:14:48,051 --> 01:14:50,887
What do you think happened?

990
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:52,589
I don't know.

991
01:14:52,622 --> 01:14:54,624
Heard stories about
these islands.

992
01:14:54,658 --> 01:14:56,526
About people eating people.

993
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:57,894
What?

994
01:14:57,927 --> 01:15:00,129
I never believed it.

995
01:15:01,297 --> 01:15:03,833
Laine.

996
01:15:03,867 --> 01:15:04,734
Where's Laine?

997
01:15:04,768 --> 01:15:08,071
He's, he's asking
about some woman.

998
01:15:08,104 --> 01:15:11,875
He was on
the beach by himself.

999
01:15:11,908 --> 01:15:12,942
Don't move.

1000
01:15:12,976 --> 01:15:13,877
We're gonna get you some help,

1001
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:16,580
you're gonna be okay.

1002
01:15:23,987 --> 01:15:25,822
Do you think it's possible?

1003
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:26,923
Cannibals?

1004
01:15:26,956 --> 01:15:29,959
I hope to god, not.

1005
01:15:29,993 --> 01:15:33,262
Kevin, I'm scared,
get us out of here.

1006
01:15:34,798 --> 01:15:36,532
Okay.
