1
00:00:10,296 --> 00:00:15,301
I spoked to a
professional person, who has told me

2
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:20,434
that what was happening to me,
was what they described as

3
00:00:20,595 --> 00:00:23,097
a pre-meltdown penultimate.

4
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:29,127
<i>This are perhaps
the last haunting words</i>

5
00:00:29,227 --> 00:00:32,026
<i>of director Damien Cockburn,</i>

6
00:00:32,193 --> 00:00:34,428
<i>the director of the film
Tropic Thunder, a film</i>

7
00:00:34,593 --> 00:00:38,596
<i>that like a cinematic Titanic,
was doomed to sink,</i>

8
00:00:38,793 --> 00:00:43,592
<i>taking with it it's cast and crew,
before it even come ashore</i>

9
00:00:43,692 --> 00:00:47,295
<i>on the shores of the American cinema.</i>

10
00:00:52,324 --> 00:00:56,394
<i>War, a theme that has inspired
countless directors</i>

11
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:58,457
<i>and Hollywood productions.</i>

12
00:00:58,557 --> 00:01:01,026
<i>But what is war?</i>

13
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,988
<i>What is it mean
to take another man's life?</i>

14
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:06,489
<i>War is murder,</i>

15
00:01:06,589 --> 00:01:09,589
<i>or institutionalized genocide?</i>

16
00:01:10,455 --> 00:01:15,393
<i>What is it in our nature, that
compels perfectly rational human beings</i>

17
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:17,555
<i>to kill one another?</i>

18
00:01:18,222 --> 00:01:20,320
- It turns!
- And action!

19
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,655
<i>None of these questions
interested me.</i>

20
00:01:22,787 --> 00:01:25,556
<i>What interests me
is making a documentary</i>

21
00:01:25,687 --> 00:01:30,920
<i>about making of a film,
that led to it's on unmaking.</i>

22
00:01:31,394 --> 00:01:33,143
Hello.

23
00:01:33,243 --> 00:01:37,388
I am documentary filmmaker, Jan Jürgen.

24
00:01:37,553 --> 00:01:39,486
For many years,
I have been fascinated

25
00:01:39,586 --> 00:01:43,056
by the most magicalist of all
places, Hollywood.

26
00:01:43,818 --> 00:01:46,654
As a boy growing up in Wiesbaden,
Germany,

27
00:01:46,784 --> 00:01:48,285
I would go to the cinema,

28
00:01:48,385 --> 00:01:52,655
and marvel at the larger than life
film gods on the silver screen.

29
00:01:52,783 --> 00:01:57,287
Mark Hamil, James Garner,
and of course, Barbara Hershey.

30
00:01:58,383 --> 00:02:00,250
But I also remember
thinking to myself:

31
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,120
"Is there are a more forbidding
sinister side to Hollywood,

32
00:02:04,282 --> 00:02:08,616
"than the lies perpetuated
by the studio system?

33
00:02:08,716 --> 00:02:12,115
Of course,
these are the questions of a child.

34
00:02:12,315 --> 00:02:15,448
But that question
still lingers to this day.

35
00:02:15,548 --> 00:02:19,218
<i>Last year I was ask to document
the making of a Vietnam war classic</i>

36
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,447
<i>called Tropic Thunder.</i>

37
00:02:21,547 --> 00:02:25,883
What you're about to see, is it
unflinchingly as possible a look

38
00:02:26,014 --> 00:02:29,314
at the making of a Hollywood nightmare.

39
00:02:30,013 --> 00:02:34,283
My nightmare:
Tropic Thunder.

40
00:02:37,245 --> 00:02:38,979
<i>In the fall of 2007,</i>

41
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:42,179
<i>the renowned Broadway theater director,
Damien Cockburn</i>

42
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:46,446
<i>was shooting one of the most
expensive Vietnam war movie ever made.</i>

43
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:47,878
Roll camera, please!

44
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:51,643
<i>Costing well over 300 million,
and filming on location in Vietnam,</i>

45
00:02:51,743 --> 00:02:55,643
<i>Tropic Thunder boasted one of the
most unlikely cast of all time.</i>

46
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:58,910
Don't fucking whine.
What do you think, I am a dick?

47
00:02:59,076 --> 00:03:02,076
<i>Cracking under the pressure
of a blockbuster filmmaking,</i>

48
00:03:02,176 --> 00:03:05,474
<i>Damien and his cast suddenly
and mysteriously disappeared.</i>

49
00:03:05,575 --> 00:03:07,043
<i>Rumors abundant</i>

50
00:03:07,175 --> 00:03:11,376
<i>about the whereabouts of actors
Tugg Speedman and Jeff Portnoy...</i>

51
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:14,574
<i>Studio's head,
Les Grossman refuses to finance</i>

52
00:03:14,674 --> 00:03:16,242
<i>additional search effort saying, quote:</i>

53
00:03:16,374 --> 00:03:18,776
<i>"I spend all the money
I am going to spend on this film. "</i>

54
00:03:18,973 --> 00:03:22,409
<i>But what actually happened
to the cast and crew of Tropic Thunder?</i>

55
00:03:22,607 --> 00:03:25,173
<i>To answer these questions,
we must take a journey,</i>

56
00:03:25,273 --> 00:03:28,440
<i>not just in the heart of the conflict
that was the Vietnam War,</i>

57
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,576
<i>but also a journey into madness.</i>

58
00:03:37,705 --> 00:03:40,138
<i>In 2005, Damien purchased the rights</i>

59
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:43,238
<i>to an obscure memoir,
called Tropic Thunder,</i>

60
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,070
<i>written by retired army sergeant,
and Vietnam veteran,</i>

61
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,472
<i>John "Four Leaf" Tayback.</i>

62
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:51,937
<i>Four Leaf, named such because of
it's incredible luck in battle</i>

63
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:55,569
<i>was the platoon sergeant of an
elite handpicked group of soldiers,</i>

64
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:58,336
<i>code named:
Tropic Thunder.</i>

65
00:03:58,436 --> 00:04:01,038
<i>Sent on suicide mission
behind enemy lines,</i>

66
00:04:01,168 --> 00:04:03,802
<i>the men of Tropic Thunder
never returned.</i>

67
00:04:03,902 --> 00:04:06,638
<i>However, Four Leaf
miraculously survived,</i>

68
00:04:06,776 --> 00:04:09,478
<i>and single handedly
completed the mission.</i>

69
00:04:09,651 --> 00:04:13,688
<i>But in the process
he lost every single hand.</i>

70
00:04:14,865 --> 00:04:16,782
<i>The studio director, Les Grossman,</i>

71
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:18,899
<i>chairman and CIO of ImagiCorp,</i>

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,052
<i>sensing commercial success,
snapped up the auction of the script.</i>

73
00:04:23,152 --> 00:04:27,689
<i>He wanted to go in the production
immediately.</i>

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,172
<i>Virtually overnight,</i>

75
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:35,621
<i>Grossman lavished over 140 million
American dollar on the film.</i>

76
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:37,522
<i>Flushed with cash,
Damien's confidence</i>

77
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,130
<i>seemed to grow exponentially
in proportion with the new budget.</i>

78
00:04:41,304 --> 00:04:43,706
How would you describe
yourself directorially?

79
00:04:43,877 --> 00:04:46,221
I often get asked this question,

80
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:50,354
and the most succinct way,
to describe myself:

81
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:52,497
50% Werner Herzog,

82
00:04:52,635 --> 00:04:56,174
50% Hal Ashby,
and 50% Peter Bogdanovich.

83
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,383
Yes, but that's 150%.

84
00:05:01,492 --> 00:05:03,492
Yes, I guess it is.

85
00:05:04,902 --> 00:05:09,239
<i>With set built, and the crew in place,
Damien began casting the film.</i>

86
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,616
<i>The first actor to be cast was
the reclusive Australian Method actor</i>

87
00:05:12,756 --> 00:05:17,536
<i>and notorious bad boy
from down under, Kirk Lazarus.</i>

88
00:05:17,636 --> 00:05:20,705
<i>No doubt, because of his award cache,
Grossman offered him the lead.</i>

89
00:05:20,878 --> 00:05:24,421
Every day, than I wake up,
I thank my father

90
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:26,623
for being an abusive alcoholic.

91
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:29,769
Because it was that exact
kind of environment,

92
00:05:29,869 --> 00:05:32,638
that I find, makes great talent.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,700
<i>Lazarus total commitment on past roles</i>

94
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,155
<i>had been borderline unnerving.</i>

95
00:05:38,293 --> 00:05:42,293
<i>While in Ireland, preparing to play
the gay priest in "Satan's Alley",</i>

96
00:05:42,393 --> 00:05:46,900
he was once found circumcising an
adult male behind a pub in Belfast.

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,219
<i>However, Lazarus, who have claimed</i>

98
00:05:49,322 --> 00:05:52,896
<i>that was no acting challenges left
for him, shunned the part of Four Leaf,</i>

99
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:55,799
<i>and insisted instead
to play the black sergeant,</i>

100
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:57,545
<i>Lincoln Osiris.</i>

101
00:05:57,645 --> 00:06:02,518
<i>In preparation, Lazarus went to
extraordinary and controversial lengths,</i>

102
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:06,328
<i>when he had his skin surgically
altered in a Singapore clinic.</i>

103
00:06:06,503 --> 00:06:10,073
<i>The results, however,
were simply astonishing.</i>

104
00:06:10,212 --> 00:06:13,582
<i>He was a true carbon copy
of the original man.</i>

105
00:06:13,756 --> 00:06:17,194
<i>During pre-production,
we visited him on several occasions.</i>

106
00:06:17,298 --> 00:06:19,767
<i>Never once did he dropped character.</i>

107
00:06:19,906 --> 00:06:23,000
But you got to walk a mile
in a man shoes.

108
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:27,584
Thats what I did. I walked a mile
in shoes, thats right.

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Now, this are 1977 sneakers.

110
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,743
That's what you gotta do.

111
00:06:33,844 --> 00:06:36,350
There is a myriad of black actors
we could cast,

112
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,222
but that's what people do.

113
00:06:38,323 --> 00:06:40,194
Who else are you thinking?

114
00:06:40,295 --> 00:06:42,196
The list is endless.

115
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,600
Denzel Washington,

116
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:49,213
Sidney Poitier.

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,856
I could go on.

118
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,263
<i>Damien seemed blind to the pitfalls
of casting a white actor</i>

119
00:06:55,403 --> 00:06:57,671
<i>to play the part of an African American.</i>

120
00:06:57,775 --> 00:07:00,177
We talked about,
whether if it was racist or not.

121
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:02,419
We came to the conclusion

122
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,098
that it definitely not racist,
so that was reassuring.

123
00:07:06,198 --> 00:07:07,999
<i>The race no longer an issue,</i>

124
00:07:08,103 --> 00:07:10,408
<i>Lazarus demanded,
that the actual family</i>

125
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,714
<i>of the real Sergeant Osiris,</i>

126
00:07:12,816 --> 00:07:16,360
<i>flown from Galveston, Texas
all the way to Vietnam.</i>

127
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,095
<i>His commitment to the role
was breathtaking.</i>

128
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,200
It's working.

129
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:23,907
It's working.

130
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:28,085
<i>Back in L.A., Les Grossman
and his producer, Rob Slolom,</i>

131
00:07:28,258 --> 00:07:30,799
<i>continued their search
for the role of Four Leaf.</i>

132
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:36,247
<i>Smelling a bargain, their top choice
was action colossus Tugg Speedman.</i>

133
00:07:36,347 --> 00:07:41,318
<i>Speedman "Scorcher" franchise
grossed over 3.4 billion worldwide.</i>

134
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,764
<i>However, Speedman's fee,</i>

135
00:07:43,901 --> 00:07:46,637
<i>which used to be 25 million
dollars of picture,</i>

136
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:49,244
<i>had fallen sharply
just under five million.</i>

137
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,916
Here we go again.

138
00:07:52,016 --> 00:07:54,026
Again!

139
00:07:54,196 --> 00:07:58,133
<i>The reason? Several failed attempt
to expend his appeal to audiences.</i>

140
00:07:58,274 --> 00:08:01,979
<i>Simple Jack, the story of an
intellectually challenged horse whisperer</i>

141
00:08:02,084 --> 00:08:05,454
<i>was a nauseating and cloying
attempt, not just to win awards,</i>

142
00:08:05,627 --> 00:08:07,900
<i>but also respect in Hollywood.</i>

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,235
I like, when we touch heads.

144
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:13,937
<i>He desperately needed to revive
his anemic career.</i>

145
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:15,569
Wake up, Pom-Pom.

146
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:18,337
<i>Many people questioned,
whether Speedman had the intelligence</i>

147
00:08:18,502 --> 00:08:20,735
<i>to tackle the complexity of such a role.</i>

148
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:22,970
You have been casted
for the role of Four Leaf.

149
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,070
What is it about this American hero,

150
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,503
that made you so desperate,
to play this role?

151
00:08:27,604 --> 00:08:32,108
It's an interesting exploration
of the American... thing.

152
00:08:32,237 --> 00:08:34,237
- One more question...
- Thank you.

153
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:36,971
You are going to be allowed
to push hair?

154
00:08:37,078 --> 00:08:39,178
<i>Speedman got the part.</i>

155
00:08:40,006 --> 00:08:43,008
<i>The next role to be cast
was the part of Fats.</i>

156
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:45,508
<i>Again, Grossman inserted
himself in the process,</i>

157
00:08:45,673 --> 00:08:48,407
<i>by inexplicably casting
celebrity train wreck,</i>

158
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:50,942

161
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:57,308
Gross!

162
00:08:57,408 --> 00:08:59,943
<i>Portnoy first become known
to the American audiences</i>

163

<i>whose best friend was
a talking motorcycle.</i>

166
00:09:08,077 --> 00:09:10,446
Knowledge is power.
For real.

167
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,649
<i>His fame went global, when he began

There is also Holly Go Lightly.

181
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,500
I'm sitting up wind.

182
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,087
- I'm sorry about that.
- No, but the wind...

183
00:10:09,187 --> 00:10:12,400
- sometimes changes direction.
- Let me go this way.

184
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,922
Yeah, but it still looping around,
hitting me in the face.

211
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:43,037
Sorry. Sorry, Damien, I'm sorry.

212
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,906
You better be fucking sorry,

- Can l take a break?

- Who the fuck are you?

216

I am the director.

217
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,408

230
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:37,685

- No. We just...

233
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,858
Yeah. Yo, we going to do
a small show, agree?

234
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:50,391

doin' it real big. We're doing the same.

00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,865

<i>Finally, Damien was pressed

244
00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:21,536

245
00:13:21,636 --> 00:13:24,696

246
00:13:24,796 --> 00:13:27,740
This is ain't gonna be pretty.

247
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,940
- Hey.
- What's coming on?

248
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,975
Nothing, just dropping by,

249
00:13:34,075 --> 00:13:37,075
to make sure the captain is shipshape.

250
00:13:37,175 --> 00:13:39,276
What is that?

251
00:13:39,376 --> 00:13:42,476
- Desperate Housewives.
- Alright.

252
00:13:42,745 --> 00:13:44,980
- You ever seen this show?
- I know, I heard about it.

253
00:13:45,112 --> 00:13:46,713
- It's fucking awesome.
- Oh yeah?

254
00:13:46,813 --> 00:13:48,813
My girlfriend got me hooked.

255
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:50,915
- Are you ready?
- Kind of. I be right out.

256
00:13:51,015 --> 00:13:54,050
OK. And get me the seasons
from Desperate Housewives.

257
00:13:54,183 --> 00:13:56,618
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm hooked.

258
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,085
- OK!
- I only watching two minutes,

259
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:01,519
- and I'm frigging hooked.
- You will hate me.

260
00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:04,680
I will hate you, if you
don't show up on the set.

261
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,795
Yeah. Fuck.

262
00:14:07,421 --> 00:14:10,090
Yeah... I think that...

263
00:14:10,255 --> 00:14:12,323
As David said to Goliath:

264
00:14:12,457 --> 00:14:15,900
- "I think we understand each other."
- Oh, hey.

265
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,992
Are you...

266
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:20,559
- They...
- The Survivor is here?

267
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,561
The season one.
Call me, if you want season 2.

268
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:25,665
- Don't hate me.
- I don't.

269
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,765
Come here.

270
00:14:27,995 --> 00:14:30,200
Just like Big Brother or something?

271

274
00:14:37,406 --> 00:14:39,399
<i>However, when the cameras rolled,</i>

275
00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:42,599
<i>it became apparent, that he yet
to learn any of his lines.</i>

276
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:46,505
<i>To all present, it was clear
that the press-on would be madness.</i>

277
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,170
<i>Lazarus seemed to be
at breaking point.</i>

278
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,686
We gonna be here all day,

279
00:14:51,786 --> 00:14:54,606
all lookin' at you,
fucked up again. Alright, hotshot.

280
00:14:54,706 --> 00:14:59,210
<i>By 4 o'clock, Speedman had cost
to production 1.6 million dollar.</i>

281
00:14:59,341 --> 00:15:01,509
<i>Also, behind the scenes,</i>

282
00:15:01,675 --> 00:15:04,243
<i>the cultural differences
between Vietnamese</i>

283
00:15:04,343 --> 00:15:07,245
<i>and the American crew
began to bubble over.</i>

284
00:15:07,377 --> 00:15:11,312
<i>Nowhere was this cultural divide
more clearly illustrated,</i>

285
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:16,049
<i>than in the mind of the film
special effects and stunt coordinator,</i>

286
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,383
<i>Cody Keith Underwood.</i>

287
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:21,984
What was this place like
before your came here? Was it...

288
00:15:22,084 --> 00:15:25,820
This place was incredible. This is
an animal sanctuary here, first off,

289
00:15:25,985 --> 00:15:29,410
and I believe, it's a sacred land. The
bush was thick, the wildlife was thick,

290
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,554
so it took us, maybe,

291
00:15:31,654 --> 00:15:35,190
six or seven days, basically
just to get that shit out of here,

292
00:15:35,322 --> 00:15:38,724
and just get it ready for what we are
doing. Something like that, right there.

293
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:41,258
I'm not trying to be dirty,
but that kind of stuff,

294
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:45,228
honestly, almost give me a boner...

295
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:48,327
There is Mother Nature, who is
obviously way bigger, than we are,

296
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:51,763
but here we are taking a piss on
Mother Nature face right here.

297
00:15:51,928 --> 00:15:54,997
This is how we show, that we are human.

298
00:15:55,196 --> 00:15:57,798
It's our instinct, to just

299
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,233
fucking crack out of it,
and beat her in the little mouth.

300
00:16:01,432 --> 00:16:03,567
Look at that. Thats beautiful.

301
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:05,534
I don't know how long those
trees had been growing for...

302
00:16:05,634 --> 00:16:07,068
But look what I'm fucking doing to him.

303
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:09,870
I win. I just beat nature today.

304
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:13,138
<i>What happened to the theme
of courage, heroism,</i>

305
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,072
<i>and arrogance
of America foreign policy?</i>

306
00:16:16,212 --> 00:16:18,393
<i>Almost uniformly,
people seemed indifferent</i>

307
00:16:18,493 --> 00:16:21,762
<i>to this subject matter altogether,
making idiotic statements,</i>

308
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:25,736
<i>that, from a P.R. perspective,
would do more harm than good.</i>

309
00:16:25,865 --> 00:16:31,153
The only difference between this film
and Vietnam is that with this film,

310
00:16:31,253 --> 00:16:33,562
we're gonna win.

311
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:39,941
<i>Day 2 started out even
worst than day 1.</i>

312
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:43,984
<i>Adding to the tension, the actual man,
"Four Leaf"Tayback</i>

313
00:16:44,112 --> 00:16:47,682
<i>had traveled to Vietnam
for the first time in 30 years,</i>

314
00:16:47,782 --> 00:16:50,751
<i>with the express purpose
to advising Speedman</i>

315
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,758
<i>on his POW scene.</i>

316
00:16:52,873 --> 00:16:55,120
<i>I was just sitting down
to interview Four Leaf,</i>

317
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,356
<i>when my producer,
Friedrich, slipped me a note.</i>

318
00:16:58,493 --> 00:17:01,699
<i>Tugg Speedman wanted to
participate in the interview.</i>

319
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:05,736
<i>It was the first time, when Tugg had
willingly sat down in front of my lens.</i>

320
00:17:05,865 --> 00:17:07,850
<i>I was happy to accommodate.</i>

321
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:11,150
<i>It was also the first time
the two men had met.</i>

322
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,811
It's been extremely difficult to learn
how to use the hooks?

323
00:17:14,911 --> 00:17:17,428
I am holding an espresso.

324
00:17:18,431 --> 00:17:20,414
Four Leaf,

325
00:17:20,514 --> 00:17:24,648
how hard has it been,
since you lost your hands?

326
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,600
When I lost these,

327
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:33,434
it was like I saw through

328
00:17:34,893 --> 00:17:38,162
these, for the first time.

329
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,463
Then I begin to realize that,

330
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:46,100
I have never really used these.

331
00:17:46,992 --> 00:17:50,412
And I'm trying to explain to him,

332
00:17:51,588 --> 00:17:54,820
that he has to use something

333
00:17:54,921 --> 00:17:58,033
in himself, somewhere.

334
00:17:58,133 --> 00:18:00,133
I have to find another coffee.

335
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:02,365
This type, he looks like a Buddha.

336
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:05,135
I want to rub his belly for luck.

337
00:18:05,242 --> 00:18:08,545
<i>Shortly after I turned off my camera
for these interviews,</i>

338
00:18:08,648 --> 00:18:11,217
<i>some alarming news came over the wire.</i>

339
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:14,186
<i>A tropical typhoon
was threatening the coastline,</i>

340
00:18:14,286 --> 00:18:18,134
<i>and was projected to slam hard
somewhere in the Southeast Asia.</i>

341
00:18:18,234 --> 00:18:21,770
<i>By morning, the threat of typhoon
had became more dire.</i>

342
00:18:21,904 --> 00:18:25,506
<i>The first signs of what was to came
began to show themselves.</i>

343
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:29,206
<i>Despite this, Damien whipping his crew
onward like sled dogs</i>

344
00:18:29,306 --> 00:18:31,338
<i>demanded work continue.</i>

345
00:18:31,491 --> 00:18:34,169
- Mr. Cockburn, are we cutting?
- No, we are still rolling.

346
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:35,919
- Still rolling.
- Still rolling.

347
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,320
<i>But by noon, the situation
was hopeless for the film.</i>

348
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,732
<i>Speedman fled to Hollywood
in his private plane.</i>

349
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,402
<i>Lazarus, again refusing
to drop character,</i>

350
00:18:45,544 --> 00:18:48,944
<i>charted a C-130 cargo plane
to airlift himself, his fake family,</i>

351
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,300
<i>and thankfully,
myself and my crew,</i>

352
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,782
<i>back to his fake real hometown,
Galveston, Texas.</i>

353
00:18:54,899 --> 00:18:57,835
<i>It was here that we chose
to raid out the storm.</i>

354
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,575
<i>But the storm had seemed
to had come to Texas with us.</i>

355
00:19:00,685 --> 00:19:02,186
Hey, I heard that!

356
00:19:02,337 --> 00:19:05,477
<i>Lazarus, more than ever,
did not seem himself.</i>

357
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:10,080
<i>He was acting erratic, refused to sleep,
and was suffering explosive outbursts.</i>

358
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,253
I'm the fucking king of the mountain!

359
00:19:12,353 --> 00:19:15,022
- You're crazy.
- I'm crazy?

360
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,098
- Damn! Holy shit.
- What? Yeah?

361
00:19:17,246 --> 00:19:19,361
<i>Something was terribly wrong.</i>

362
00:19:19,461 --> 00:19:22,678
What we are seeing,
is an acute form of P.P.S.D.

363
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,618
I never heard of this.

364
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:27,421
I'm sorry. Post-Platoon Stress Disorder.

365
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:30,265
<i>The first documented case
was Charlie Sheen.</i>

366
00:19:30,372 --> 00:19:33,241
<i>And when you have an actor,
like Mr. Lazarus...</i>

367
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,381
Hold on, don't move. We cool. What?

368
00:19:35,496 --> 00:19:38,699
<i>...it would be unusual,
if he didn't suffer from this disorder.</i>

369
00:19:38,835 --> 00:19:42,538
I gave you life.
I gave you a coat.

370
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:45,839
These fucking chips,
that's all me too, baby!

371
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:48,851
It's all my shit!
I run this shit!

372
00:19:48,951 --> 00:19:52,222
<i>The same diagnose has been given
to Colin Farrell after "Tigerland",</i>

373
00:19:52,322 --> 00:19:54,622
<i>Jim Caviezel after "Thin Red Line",</i>

374
00:19:54,722 --> 00:19:59,222
<i>and incredibly, even Robin Williams
after shooting "Good Morning, Vietnam".</i>

375
00:19:59,322 --> 00:20:01,910
<i>I was grateful at the end of it,</i>

376
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:07,000
<i>when we were able to return
to the madness of Vietnam.</i>

377
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,257
<i>Upon our return to Southeast Asia,
I was stunned.</i>

378
00:20:10,358 --> 00:20:12,358
<i>Total devastation.</i>

379
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:16,000
<i>All the sets has been smashed,
like children's toothpicks,</i>

380
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,311
<i>and an entire battlefield
was washed in the Mekong river.</i>

381
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:22,613
<i>In just under two weeks
and five days of shooting,</i>

382
00:20:22,713 --> 00:20:26,000
<i>the production had lost
almost 240 million dollar.</i>

383
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,700
<i>All that he showed for it,
was several discombobulated scenes</i>

384
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,000
<i>and a script, that was in ruin.</i>

385
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,000
<i>Les Grossman, in a rage,
called the accounting to say,</i>

386
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,900
<i>he was pulling the plug
the following morning.</i>

387
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,366
<i>Faced with such an impossible deadline,</i>

388
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:42,901
<i>there was little hope
in reviving the film.</i>

389
00:20:43,001 --> 00:20:45,903
<i>Later that night, however,
in a brilliant move,</i>

390
00:20:46,003 --> 00:20:48,642
<i>Damien did something
that was both politically sawy,</i>

391
00:20:48,742 --> 00:20:52,080
<i>and economically feasible.
He courageously chose to shot</i>

392
00:20:52,229 --> 00:20:55,165
<i>the most heartbreaking
and moving scene in the script.</i>

393
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:57,625
<i>It was Speedman's monologue.</i>

394
00:20:57,726 --> 00:21:00,089
<i>Set it night, in a trench,</i>

395
00:21:00,245 --> 00:21:03,615
<i>Four Leaf, knowing his man
an being led to the slaughter,</i>

396
00:21:03,781 --> 00:21:07,084
<i>he is faced with the task of urging
his men not just to fight,</i>

397
00:21:07,251 --> 00:21:11,248
<i>but to fight bravely and to the death.
If Damien could pulled off,</i>

398
00:21:11,392 --> 00:21:14,391
<i>Les Grossman would certainly see
the film Oscar potential,</i>

399
00:21:14,491 --> 00:21:16,893
<i>and loosen the purse strings yet again.</i>

400
00:21:16,993 --> 00:21:18,802
<i>Damien seemed calm.</i>

401
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:22,676
<i>The mood, by contrast,
was thick with anticipation.</i>

402
00:21:22,776 --> 00:21:27,213
Four Leaf comes in and talks to them,
almost like a Christ-like figure,

403
00:21:27,357 --> 00:21:29,783
- if I could say that.
- Yes, you can.

404
00:21:29,883 --> 00:21:33,686
He is an almost Christ-like figure then.
I said that.

405
00:21:33,858 --> 00:21:36,760
There is a wonderful speech
where he said:

406
00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:39,491
"Death is, but a moment.

407
00:21:39,686 --> 00:21:42,686
Cowardice is a lifetime of affliction."

408
00:21:43,525 --> 00:21:46,628
The idea, that death being
a moment, is just...

409
00:21:46,792 --> 00:21:51,000
both terrifying and yet
strangely comforting.

410
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:56,039
Just be discreet. He knows
that we maybe coming. Follow me.

411
00:21:56,154 --> 00:21:59,754
Hey, don't mind the guys,
they just covering, so...

412
00:21:59,854 --> 00:22:02,182
- Reality show.
- Reality show.

413
00:22:02,283 --> 00:22:04,777
- I wanted to talk to you...
- Okay, okay.

414
00:22:04,877 --> 00:22:07,977
- ...About the speech.
- Shoot, daddy.

415
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:11,360
I was wondering, maybe you could
skip some of my lines I got,

416
00:22:11,481 --> 00:22:14,934
some of the other guys.
Because it feels a little bit like...

417
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:18,087
I don't know, it's a little bit talky.
You hear me?

418
00:22:18,251 --> 00:22:21,187
Yeah, it's a lot of words, but...

419
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:25,152
I liked you to say:
"Death spring not from darkness.

420
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:31,218
Yet be not afraid gentlemen,
for hope is its handmaiden.

421
00:22:31,318 --> 00:22:35,025
Do not fear death,
because death is only a moment.

422
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:38,537
Cowardice is a lifetime of affliction."

423
00:22:38,637 --> 00:22:42,504
That's what I am saying.
For me, I know my audience understand.

424
00:22:42,604 --> 00:22:46,277
They don't understand words,
like "affliction" and "cowardish".

425
00:22:46,377 --> 00:22:49,213
- It's cowardice.
- What is that mean?

426
00:22:49,442 --> 00:22:51,977
- What do you mean?
- It's like a female coward.

427
00:22:52,102 --> 00:22:53,803
Not "cowardess", it's cowardice.

428
00:22:53,921 --> 00:22:55,856
- Cowardess?
- I-C-E, ice...

429
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:59,175
Okay, but you're understand
that while we have this conversation,

430
00:22:59,275 --> 00:23:02,475
I gonna get popcorn and take a piss.

431
00:23:02,575 --> 00:23:04,926
Oh, boy.

432
00:23:05,026 --> 00:23:08,378
You know, it should be like:
"Look, we are going out there, right?

433
00:23:08,571 --> 00:23:10,906
We gonna... kick some ass, right."

434
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:13,998
Or should be like:
"Tomorrow is gonna suck.

435
00:23:14,195 --> 00:23:16,521
Suck up and deal.

436
00:23:16,621 --> 00:23:18,783
Cock the gun.

437
00:23:18,883 --> 00:23:22,116
Don't say it, do it. Maggots.

438
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:24,000
Over and out."

439
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,608
High five. Don't say it, do it.

440
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,853
- I...
- "Over and out".

441
00:23:30,974 --> 00:23:34,931
- I don't know, what that means.
- "Over and out"?

442
00:23:35,031 --> 00:23:38,223
That we say on walkie-talkie,
when we finished talking.

443
00:23:38,378 --> 00:23:42,348
No, sorry. Excuse me.
I know what "Over and out" means.

444
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:45,932
Yeah, it's something
that everybody knows.

445
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:50,220
Fucking cunt!

446
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,600
<i>The following morning,
after a fruitless night of shooting,</i>

447
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,356
<i>Damien had become uncooperative.</i>

448
00:23:56,456 --> 00:23:59,703
I don't care no more.
You're part of the machine.

449
00:23:59,803 --> 00:24:02,109
You're part of the machine.

450
00:24:02,209 --> 00:24:05,563
You think you are outside,
but you're part of the machine.

451
00:24:05,663 --> 00:24:09,085
Deal with it, dude.
I don't give a shit. So...

452
00:24:09,233 --> 00:24:11,835
<i>He seemed to be almost totally unhinged.</i>

453
00:24:11,961 --> 00:24:13,762
Shoot that.

454
00:24:13,881 --> 00:24:17,654
Put that ass as an attachment,
and send it as an email to Les Grossman.

455
00:24:17,754 --> 00:24:20,870
<i>- Good night, Vienna.
- But in moments of this exchange,</i>

456
00:24:20,998 --> 00:24:24,185
<i>word came down, that
Les Grossman had pulled the plug.</i>

457
00:24:24,285 --> 00:24:27,623
So, it's finally over.

458
00:24:27,723 --> 00:24:29,882
No, it's not over.

459
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,757
This is just the beginning.

460
00:24:32,857 --> 00:24:35,535
This is just the beginning.

461
00:24:35,636 --> 00:24:40,861
<i>These cryptic words
would come back to haunt me.</i>

462
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:44,715
<i>In what would be
my final interview with him,</i>

463
00:24:44,892 --> 00:24:49,332
<i>it was clear that something inside
of Damien had completely shattered.</i>

464
00:24:49,432 --> 00:24:53,432
I am in a place, now, which is...

465
00:24:53,532 --> 00:24:59,532
Umm, it's a place of total clarity.

466
00:25:00,072 --> 00:25:03,021
I don't feel anger, I feel just...

467
00:25:03,122 --> 00:25:07,051
- Love, perhaps.
- I feel... Yeah, I feel love.

468
00:25:07,188 --> 00:25:11,158
I don't bear any kind of...

469
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:15,256
- Resentment.
- Resentment or grudge...

470
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:18,657
- I am calm and I feel united...
- With yourself.

471
00:25:18,845 --> 00:25:24,070
Yeah, but let me fucking finish.
Interrupting me, Jesus!

472
00:25:24,427 --> 00:25:27,500
Anyway, I am feeling better.

473
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,065
<i>Damien was anything but feeling better.</i>

474
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,400
<i>Early the next morning
roused from my slumber,</i>

475
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,786
<i>I received urgent and terrible news.</i>

476
00:25:40,886 --> 00:25:43,688
What? What is it?

477
00:25:43,935 --> 00:25:46,604
<i>Damien and the cast
had gone missing.</i>

478
00:25:46,783 --> 00:25:47,783
What?

479
00:25:47,901 --> 00:25:50,169
<i>The greatest fear of
every documentarian,</i>

480
00:25:50,306 --> 00:25:52,875
<i>is that they themselves
will become their own subject,</i>

481
00:25:53,017 --> 00:25:56,103
<i>but with this new developments,
I had no choice.</i>

482
00:25:56,203 --> 00:25:59,339
<i>I leaped into action,
and hatched an action plan.</i>

483
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:01,892
<i>Find Damien and the cast.</i>

484
00:26:02,142 --> 00:26:06,207
<i>They were last seen boarding a chopper,
that had flown in a north-west direction</i>

485
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:10,819
<i>into one of the most lethal and
dangerous part of Southeast Asia.</i>

486
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:15,496
<i>We had many kilometers to cover,
and the jungle would be unforgiving.</i>

487
00:26:15,597 --> 00:26:20,545
<i>However, by nightfall,
we had made faint signs of progress.</i>

488
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:25,845
We just come across this,
which appears to be some blood.

489
00:26:25,945 --> 00:26:28,143
I going to touch it.

490
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:32,606
I don't like touching things,
it's dirty, but i am going through.

491
00:26:32,775 --> 00:26:35,811
Yes, thats blood. I will try it.

492
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,697
Yes, it's blood.
Taste like iron.

493
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:43,320
<i>Two more hours
we trekked through the jungle,</i>

494
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,506
<i>and just when we were about
to turn ourselves back,</i>

495
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:50,403
<i>we came across the most
tantalizing piece of evidence so far.</i>

496
00:26:50,504 --> 00:26:53,104
Looks like a video recorder.

497
00:26:53,926 --> 00:26:58,000
There is a tape inside.
It's very exciting.

498
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,205
<i>I returned to the hotel with pits
in my stomach, eager to play the tape.</i>

499
00:27:02,306 --> 00:27:06,984
<i>Damien was indeed on the tape,
and so was the rest of the actors.</i>

500
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:11,016
<i>But also there was something
so shocking and so awful</i>

501
00:27:11,116 --> 00:27:14,719
<i>that I questioned whether
my eyes were actually lying to me.</i>

502
00:27:14,877 --> 00:27:18,878
<i>Worst of all, it had actually
happened to human beings.</i>

503
00:27:18,978 --> 00:27:21,484
<i>The thought, that people
had experienced this,</i>

504
00:27:21,621 --> 00:27:25,959
<i>made me question life, God,
humanity and the point of living.</i>

505
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:29,992
<i>Several weeks after shooting,
I even became suicidal.</i>

506
00:27:30,092 --> 00:27:33,762
This is probably the single most

507
00:27:33,989 --> 00:27:37,025
disturbing,

508
00:27:37,174 --> 00:27:41,174
awful and disgusting film I ever seen.

509
00:27:43,883 --> 00:27:46,583
I watch it one more time.

510
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:53,954
<i>Let's go, and make
the greatest war movie ever!</i>

511
00:27:54,055 --> 00:27:56,590
<i>- Yeah!
- Yeah!</i>

512
00:27:57,477 --> 00:27:59,477
<i>Yes!</i>

513
00:28:00,026 --> 00:28:02,500
<i>And watched again, I did.</i>

514
00:28:02,665 --> 00:28:06,495
What is important, it's not the amazing
footage, which you will never see,

515
00:28:06,595 --> 00:28:09,997
but instead the lives of artists
who tried to make Tropic Thunder.

516
00:28:10,097 --> 00:28:12,828
<i>I remember them as the
human beings they were,</i>

517
00:28:12,932 --> 00:28:16,435
<i>not the grotesque pieces
of human remains they become.</i>

518
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:19,947
<i>What is it, that drove Damien
to the edge of lunacy?</i>

519
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:22,716
<i>Why did the cast sabotaged itself?</i>

520
00:28:22,895 --> 00:28:28,100
<i>And finally, what about Hollywood,
the land of false promises?</i>

521
00:28:29,171 --> 00:28:32,081
What is the answer
to all of these questions?

522
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:34,254
I will never tell you.

523
00:28:34,388 --> 00:28:37,891
What I have showed you,
is in the end, the truth.

524
00:28:38,081 --> 00:28:40,896
Not this spoon-fed
Hollywood version of it.

525
00:28:40,996 --> 00:28:44,999
This time, unlike Hollywood,
you must decide for yourself,

526
00:28:45,197 --> 00:28:48,948
what is real and what is illusion.

527
00:28:49,049 --> 00:28:53,049
But be warned, you may
find yourself a prisoner to Hollywood,

528
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:57,249
and it's torrential rain of madness.

529
00:29:14,072 --> 00:29:17,149
From out of the dark
is the South Central g., ready

530
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,934
hand steady on a bloody machete.

531
00:29:20,034 --> 00:29:23,334
A devil is on my shoulder.
Should I kill it? Hell, yeah!

532
00:29:23,434 --> 00:29:29,426
I slice Jack, took an ax,
and gave that bitch, Jill, forty wacks.

533
00:29:29,526 --> 00:29:32,712
With my hip-hop, it don't stop,

534
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:36,105
until heads roll off the cutting block.

535
00:29:36,205 --> 00:29:39,626
Da Lench Mob - Cut Throats
Planet Of Da Apes 1994
