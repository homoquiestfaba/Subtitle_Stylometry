        Lyra, can you hear me?  

902
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:27,822
                    Yes.        

903
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:29,824
            You're as--         

904
01:20:33,695 --> 01:20:35,629
            You're as beautiful 
            as your mother.     

905
01:20:41,636 --> 01:20:43,270
                I love you.     

906
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:51,712
    You're home now, sweetheart.

907
01:20:53,481 --> 01:20:55,282
            You're home.        

908
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:43,163
        [ Matriarch ]           
        I never thought         
        I would see the day...  

909
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:45,766
        when I would set foot   
        in Eos.                 

910
01:21:47,102 --> 01:21:49,403
Nor I the day                   
I would welcome you             
to it.                          

911
01:21:52,974 --> 01:21:56,176
        Your father's sacrifice 
        will not be forgotten.  

912
01:21:57,078 --> 01:21:58,612
            He was a good man.  

913
01:22:00,015 --> 01:22:01,482
                He was.         

914
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:05,252
    Lieutenant Mason has        
    a proposition for us.       

915
01:22:19,467 --> 01:22:21,201
The old Mars...                 

916
01:22:22,404 --> 01:22:23,871
    is gone.                    

917
01:22:25,507 --> 01:22:27,508
My father ended that world.     

918
01:22:29,177 --> 01:22:30,244
        And we...               

919
01:22:30,312 --> 01:22:32,546
need to create a new one.       

920
01:22:33,748 --> 01:22:36,083
A world where we use            
our differences,                

921
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:40,187
    our knowledge and--         

922
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:42,790
    and our faith...            

923
01:22:42,857 --> 01:22:44,825
to keep our people safe.        

924
01:22:45,694 --> 01:22:47,394
            What do you propose?

925
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:50,864
        First step--            

926
01:22:52,367 --> 01:22:55,402
    a new faction...            

927
01:22:55,470 --> 01:23:00,040
comprised of                    
both Marauders and Colonists.   

928
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:05,879
A force empowered               
to protect both of our nations. 

929
01:23:05,947 --> 01:23:08,882
A unit which could              
show that...                    

930
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:12,186
    maybe, in the end,          

931
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:16,557
no matter which tribe           
we belong to,                   
we are all Martians.            

932
01:23:17,926 --> 01:23:21,061
        There will be           
        resistance to this idea.

933
01:23:21,129 --> 01:23:24,365
        I am not certain any of 
        my warriors will be so--

934
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:42,950
        Is it your wish to join 
        Red Faction, Leonid?    

935
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,955
There is no place for me        
in your world.                  

936
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:53,093
        A place could be made.  

937
01:23:55,263 --> 01:23:58,399
I will never be                 
what you want, Mother.          

938
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:07,908
        You fought bravely.     

939
01:24:07,976 --> 01:24:12,146
    You've learned the lesson   
    of the wandering.           
    Come home.                  

940
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:15,282
What my wandering taught me     
is that...                      

941
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:18,919
I need to join this new faction.

942
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:23,357
                Want...         

943
01:24:23,425 --> 01:24:24,925
                and need...     

944
01:24:24,993 --> 01:24:28,028
    are two very                
    different things, Leonid.   

945
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:34,735
                Very well.      

946
01:24:39,174 --> 01:24:43,410
On an occasion like this,       
it is custom to exchange gifts. 

947
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:52,886
            [ All Gasp ]        

948
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:08,235
This belonged to my mother.     

949
01:25:12,173 --> 01:25:13,974
            I will kill someone 
            you hate with this. 

950
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:19,146
                That...         
                sounds great.   

951
01:25:22,884 --> 01:25:24,384
                        Jake.   

952
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:27,221
Hey.                            

953
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:30,390
            So, we're starting  
            a new Red Faction.  

954
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:33,227
    Mm-hmm.                     
            I want to sign up.  

955
01:25:33,294 --> 01:25:35,996
        - No.                   
        - Excuse me?            

956
01:25:36,064 --> 01:25:38,999
I'm just not sure               
I'm comfortable having          
someone like you on the team.   

957
01:25:39,067 --> 01:25:41,268
You know,                       
someone from Earth.             

958
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:42,803
                    What?       

959
01:25:44,405 --> 01:25:46,373
            Are you kidding me? 
            After everything    
            we've been through? 

960
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:50,644
God, did I misjudge you, Jake.  

961
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:55,115
That you, of all people,        
would subscribe to that kind    
of bigoted, ignorant world view.

962
01:25:55,183 --> 01:25:57,017
    I just-- I just-- I just--  

963
01:25:58,186 --> 01:26:00,621
        I'm already             
        on the team, aren't I?  

964
01:26:00,688 --> 01:26:02,656
You are the smart one, Tess.    

965
01:26:13,067 --> 01:26:15,769
        Sorry. It's kind of--   
        kind of messy.          

966
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:36,256
I-- I gotta warn you.           
No one went up there very much.
