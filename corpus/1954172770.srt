1
00:05:19,894 --> 00:05:21,719
Hello?

2
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,423
You've had an accident.

3
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:34,565
You need an ambulance.
I'll call for one. I'll be right back.

4
00:05:35,273 --> 00:05:38,213
-Lie still here.
-No.

5
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:39,755
No …

6
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:41,740
No what?

7
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:44,585
I don't need an ambulance.

8
00:05:45,165 --> 00:05:46,638
I can clearly see you do.

9
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,834
I'll call for one.

10
00:05:49,772 --> 00:05:53,903
In that case, I'll be up and gone before you have the time to come back.

11
00:05:56,117 --> 00:05:57,679
That will hurt.

12
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,521
That's possible,

13
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:01,523
but it doesn't matter to me.

14
00:06:04,727 --> 00:06:06,037
I know.

15
00:06:06,134 --> 00:06:08,379
I assume you don't want me to call the police, either.

16
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:11,995
Yes, that's exactly right.

17
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,193
Is there anything you want?

18
00:06:27,743 --> 00:06:30,105
I'd like a cup of tea

19
00:06:30,281 --> 00:06:31,601
with some milk.

20
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,759
Well.

21
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,903
You'd have to come with me.

22
00:06:41,187 --> 00:06:43,866
I don't serve tea in the street.

23
00:06:46,512 --> 00:06:47,855
Can you walk?

24
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,210
Yeah.

25
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,889
I've even bought a cake.

26
00:07:02,427 --> 00:07:04,198
I'll wash your clothes.

27
00:07:04,352 --> 00:07:07,240
-Not my coat.
-It smells rather badly.

28
00:07:07,453 --> 00:07:08,949
It's my coat.

29
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:11,670
It's your coat.

30
00:07:14,484 --> 00:07:16,300
So what happened?

31
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,585
Were you robbed?

32
00:07:22,565 --> 00:07:23,871
It's my own fault.

33
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,106
I'm just a bad human being.

34
00:07:29,768 --> 00:07:32,869
-I've never met a bad human being.
-Well, you have now.

35
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:37,043
Do you want to talk about it?

36
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,699
You wouldn't understand.

37
00:07:42,385 --> 00:07:43,738
Well, try me.

38
00:07:46,785 --> 00:07:48,756
But I wouldn't know where to start.

39
00:07:57,987 --> 00:08:00,875
Why is that ridiculous fishhook hanging there?

40
00:08:01,905 --> 00:08:03,228
It's a fly.

41
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,687
I caught a fish with it once, a rather big one.

42
00:08:07,302 --> 00:08:08,641
Strangely enough.

43
00:08:12,044 --> 00:08:16,147
Fly-fishing is about tying feathers and other things to a hook.

44
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:19,728
So it resembles something a fish likes to eat.

45
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:23,138
And then because the fly is very light,

46
00:08:23,393 --> 00:08:25,419
you have to have a line that is heavy.

47
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,885
It creates the velocity when you cast.

48
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,993
You fish a lot?

49
00:08:36,644 --> 00:08:38,914
Well, some.

50
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:41,653
But I don't catch much.

51
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:45,309
When I was young, I …

52
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:48,031
I had a book I …
I worshipped.

53
00:08:49,193 --> 00:08:51,324
It was an old book by Izaak Walton

54
00:08:51,473 --> 00:08:53,317
called 'The Complete Angler'.

55
00:08:56,323 --> 00:08:59,162
It was like a romantic nature bible to me.

56
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,921
<u>THE SECOND DAY</u>

57
00:09:04,276 --> 00:09:06,612
Maybe I know where to start.

58
00:09:10,594 --> 00:09:12,661
But if you're to understand, I'll …

59
00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:15,890
I'll have to tell you the whole story.

60
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:17,894
And it will be long.

61
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:20,733
Long …

62
00:09:20,871 --> 00:09:22,363
is good.

63
00:09:22,998 --> 00:09:25,219
And moral, I'm afraid.

64
00:09:32,904 --> 00:09:34,428
<u>CHAPTER ONE
THE COMPLEASANGLES</u>

65
00:09:34,446 --> 00:09:36,097
To begin with the bait,

66
00:09:36,985 --> 00:09:39,394
<i>I discovered my cunt as a two-year-old.</i>

67
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:45,810
<i>At an early age, I was mechanically inclined.</i>

68
00:09:46,183 --> 00:09:50,601
<i>Kinetic energy, for example,
has always fascinated me.</i>

69
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:52,629
<i>And my friend,</i>

70
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:54,208
<i>let's call her B</i>

71
00:09:54,453 --> 00:09:56,774
<i>always came up with the ideas.</i>

72
00:09:58,362 --> 00:10:01,231
<i>Playing frogs was one of B's classics.</i>

73
00:10:25,477 --> 00:10:26,824
Joe, are you all right?

74
00:10:26,885 --> 00:10:28,245
Just a moment.

75
00:10:30,603 --> 00:10:31,950
<i>Are you done?</i>

76
00:10:42,147 --> 00:10:44,657
For Christ's sakes, leave them alone.

77
00:10:45,861 --> 00:10:47,971
<i>I loved my father very much.</i>

78
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:49,610
<i>He was a doctor.</i>

79
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:52,532
<i>My mother's name was Katherine.</i>

80
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:54,561
<i>My father called her Kay.</i>

81
00:10:56,362 --> 00:10:59,570
<i>I suppose she was what you'd call a cold bitch.</i>

82
00:11:00,657 --> 00:11:03,769
<i>She always had her back turned when she played solitaire.</i>

83
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:05,978
<i>I hated solitaire.</i>

84
00:11:12,582 --> 00:11:17,041
<i>When we had P.E., I'd climb up into the ropes and hang there for ages</i>

85
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,970
<i>with the rope between my legs.</i>

86
00:11:20,477 --> 00:11:22,199
'The Sensation' we called it.

87
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:25,251
<i>I remember very distinctly this word,</i>

88
00:11:25,444 --> 00:11:26,974
<i>sensation.</i>

89
00:11:33,163 --> 00:11:36,328
<i>Perhaps the only difference between me and other people</i>

90
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:40,318
<i>is that I've always demanded more from the sunset.</i>

91
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,430
<i>More spectacular colours</i>

92
00:11:43,505 --> 00:11:45,636
<i>when the sun hit the horizon.</i>

93
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:50,188
Joe:
That's perhaps my only sin.

94
00:11:53,652 --> 00:11:56,154
Why are you insisting that children are sinful?

95
00:11:56,885 --> 00:11:59,310
Not children. Me.

96
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:02,560
I don't see sin anywhere,

97
00:12:03,076 --> 00:12:04,961
but then I'm not religious.

98
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,818
That's because you don't know the rest of the story.

99
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:10,162
And by the way, I'm not religious, either.

100
00:12:11,324 --> 00:12:15,051
Why would you take the most unsympathetic aspect of religion such as …

101
00:12:15,243 --> 00:12:16,701
the concept of sin

102
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:20,423
and let it survive beyond religion?

103
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,283
I don't understand this self-hatred.

104
00:12:26,883 --> 00:12:28,497
Well, that's what I said.

105
00:12:28,876 --> 00:12:30,389
You wouldn't understand.

106
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,690
No, I'm …

107
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,630
I'm sorry, I'll shut up.

108
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:36,815
Please, continue.

109
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:49,454
Nervus...

110
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,476
Pudendus

111
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,066
Nervus

112
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:55,785
Dorsalis

113
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,561
Clitoridis

114
00:13:27,102 --> 00:13:30,703
<i>My dad loved telling me about the trees and their leaves</i>

115
00:13:30,828 --> 00:13:33,698
<i>and considered it part of a good education.</i>

116
00:13:34,891 --> 00:13:36,896
When the ash tree was created,

117
00:13:37,877 --> 00:13:40,445
it made all the other trees in the forest jealous.

118
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:43,632
It was the most beautiful tree.

119
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,848
You couldn't say anything bad about it.

120
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:53,063
Then in the winter,

121
00:13:55,783 --> 00:13:57,929
when the ash tree lost all of its leaves,

122
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,438
all the trees noticed its black buds

123
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:04,945
and started laughing.

124
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:06,604
'Oh, look,

125
00:14:07,602 --> 00:14:11,012
the ash tree's had its
fingers in the ashes.

126
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:14,704
' See,

127
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,970
you can always

128
00:14:16,977 --> 00:14:20,057
tell the ash tree in winter by the black buds.

129
00:14:22,498 --> 00:14:26,441
<i>He especially loved the childish educational stories he told</i>

130
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,041
<i>to help me remember what I had learned.</i>

131
00:14:30,426 --> 00:14:33,797
<i>I knew how much he loved telling those stories that sometimes</i>

132
00:14:33,924 --> 00:14:36,269
<i>I pretended I had forgotten them.</i>

133
00:14:44,902 --> 00:14:48,132
Am I boring you?

134
00:14:46,693 --> 00:14:48,132
No,

135
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:51,604
I'm just looking forward to how you'll get fishing weaved into your tale.

136
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:55,185
You could start with the fly on the wall there.

137
00:14:55,718 --> 00:14:57,063
It's called a nymph.

138
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:01,066
It would tie in elegantly with your discussion about nymphomania.

139
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:02,735
A nymph

140
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,785
is an early stage

141
00:15:04,902 --> 00:15:06,394
in the life of an insect.

142
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:10,716
As a quite young nymph,

143
00:15:11,388 --> 00:15:14,660
it was imperative for me to get rid of my virginity.

144
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,962
Hopla.

145
00:15:17,802 --> 00:15:19,839
I kind of knew this boy, J,

146
00:15:20,255 --> 00:15:21,861
who had a moped.

147
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:25,346
So, in my eyes, he was rather sophisticated.

148
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:31,527
I was fifteen, and perhaps my girlish romantic expectations were a bit high.

149
00:15:34,802 --> 00:15:37,317
But he had good strong hands.

150
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:41,228
I liked his hands.

151
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:44,626
Hello?

152
00:15:45,882 --> 00:15:47,602
-Hi.
-Hi.

153
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:04,064
If I asked you to take my virginity, would that be a problem?

154
00:16:05,694 --> 00:16:07,385
No, I don't see a problem.

155
00:16:11,716 --> 00:16:13,687
So, um …

156
00:16:15,268 --> 00:16:17,015
where shall I go?

157
00:16:31,855 --> 00:16:34,438
It's the fucking carburettor.

158
00:16:35,497 --> 00:16:38,025
I just can't work it out
Can you imagine that?

159
00:16:40,091 --> 00:16:42,212
-That's not very good.
-Hm?

160
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:43,566
That's not very good.

161
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:44,716
No, it bloody isn't.

162
00:16:44,717 --> 00:16:46,466
It ruins the whole idea of having a moped.

163
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,018
You should probably take off your knickers, yeah?

164
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:39,885
He shoved his cock inside me and humped me three times.

165
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:50,650
Then he turned me over like a sack of potatoes.

166
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,173
Then he humped me five times in the arse.

167
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:08,260
I never forgot those two humiliating numbers.

168
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:11,026
Three and five?

169
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,136
Those are Fibonacci numbers.

170
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:20,237
That may be.
In any case, it hurt like hell.

171
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,658
I swore I'd never sleep with anyone again.

172
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:26,843
But of course,
that only lasted a short while.

173
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,093
And now to get back to your fishing.

174
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,779
A couple of years later

175
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,017
I was at my friend B's.

176
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,645
And as always, she had a new idea,

177
00:19:38,274 --> 00:19:41,044
financed by her younger brother's piggy banks,

178
00:19:41,236 --> 00:19:43,325
which she regularly emptied.

179
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:50,496
We put on clothes later known as

180
00:19:50,954 --> 00:19:52,883
the 'fuck-me-now' clothes.

181
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,388
The idea was a competition.

182
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,978
We were to go on a train trip.

183
00:19:59,884 --> 00:20:02,335
B said there was no need for tickets.

184
00:20:03,337 --> 00:20:07,376
The one who had fucked the most men when we reached the destination

185
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,501
would win the chocolate sweets.

186
00:20:32,337 --> 00:20:33,669
May I interrupt here?

187
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,506
What you were doing when you were walking down that corridor,

188
00:20:38,156 --> 00:20:39,770
you were reading the river.

189
00:20:52,116 --> 00:20:58,980
Most of the large fish stay sheltered from the current to save energy and to hide from the prey.

190
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,055
Where the fish hide in the stream entails a very complicated hierarchy.

191
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:07,968
The topography decides where the most attractive places are,

192
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,621
and the biggest fish choose the best positions.

193
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:17,501
Smile and make eye contact.

194
00:21:17,502 --> 00:21:19,826
If you have to talk, remember to ask a lot of wh-

195
00:21:19,827 --> 00:21:22,238
questions if you want more than a yes-or-no answer.

196
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:26,266
Then it'll just happen on its own. You just take them to the lavatory and you have sex with them.

197
00:21:26,267 --> 00:21:28,302
Yeah...

198
00:21:28,303 --> 00:21:29,847
But what if it's nasty?

199
00:21:29,848 --> 00:21:33,033
<u>Then you just think of the bag of chocolate sweeties.</u>

200
00:22:03,293 --> 00:22:06,276
What …

201
00:22:04,902 --> 00:22:06,276
What time is it?

202
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,219
Ten.

203
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,650
Where do you come from?

204
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:28,826
From home.

205
00:22:35,182 --> 00:22:38,282
Who knows where the lavatory is?

206
00:22:39,168 --> 00:22:40,456
Well, if you take a right,

207
00:22:40,457 --> 00:22:43,452
you will arrive at a lavatory at the end of the car.

208
00:22:43,804 --> 00:22:51,000
At the same time, it is so cleverly arranged that if you take a left turn, you will also arrive at a lavatory,

209
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:53,778
since at the end of the next car there is also one.

210
00:22:56,622 --> 00:22:58,532
I'll show you where the lavatory is.

211
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:27,018
It turned out to be shockingly easy.

212
00:23:27,352 --> 00:23:30,562
In no time, B was ahead, five to three …

213
00:23:31,263 --> 00:23:32,763
… and it was exactly right.

214
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,908
Look them in the eye and smile.

215
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,212
But then, suddenly, it stopped.

216
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,540
That's a very clear parallel to fishing in the stream.

217
00:23:42,478 --> 00:23:45,345
As it happens, either none of the fish are feeding

218
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,455
or they all feed at the same time.

219
00:23:47,508 --> 00:23:49,601
They go into feeding frenzy.

220
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,018
All bite.

221
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,842
And then just as suddenly as it started, it stops.

222
00:23:54,407 --> 00:23:58,755
The fish most readily bite at the beginning of a light rain, and I think that's because

223
00:23:58,756 --> 00:24:01,614
they feel safe when the swim in the stream.

224
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:04,033
Because they can't be seen from above.

225
00:24:04,034 --> 00:24:06,250
The water's surface is disturbed.

226
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,268
But then it started again.

227
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:13,859
-Although a bit more slowly.
-Yeah

228
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,604
Yeah, and I think I know how.

229
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,662
Because fly-fishing can be done in several phases.

230
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,972
And if the fish stop biting,

231
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,827
you move on to phase two.

232
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,216
And in phase two, you not only imitate an insect

233
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,400
but an insect in trouble.

234
00:24:29,413 --> 00:24:31,576
You pull … you pull the line.

235
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:34,080
You tug it irregularly,

236
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,812
so the fish gets the impression that it's dealing with an injured and easy prey.

237
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,932
And then, helplessly,

238
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:43,300
let the fly float down the river again.

239
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,272
Then half-heartedly

240
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,798
make a few jumps forward again.

241
00:24:49,524 --> 00:24:52,455
It can be done …
it can be done very elegantly.

242
00:25:05,317 --> 00:25:06,840
Are you all right?

243
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,270
It's Betty.

244
00:25:10,678 --> 00:25:12,960
I was just told that she's very ill.

245
00:25:12,994 --> 00:25:15,865
Is Betty a close family member?

246
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,240
You could say that.

247
00:25:20,741 --> 00:25:22,041
She's my dwarf hamster.

248
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,384
<i>Dwarf hamster?</i>

249
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,969
<i>-You can't be serious!
-Well, what was I to do?</i>

250
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:32,220
And then I did have a dwarf hamster when I was young.

251
00:25:32,221 --> 00:25:34,174
That you were very close to?

252
00:25:34,175 --> 00:25:36,455
Not at all.
A bloody nuisance.

253
00:25:37,293 --> 00:25:39,317
Dwarf hamster.

254
00:25:39,318 --> 00:25:41,832
It would've been worse if it were a person.

255
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,750
Don't say that.

256
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:46,491
I'm extremely fond of my hamster.

257
00:25:46,492 --> 00:25:50,424
Yes, I think that's a rather cynical thing to say about Betty.

258
00:25:51,075 --> 00:25:54,506
Yes, I had made the cage nice and cosy for her when …

259
00:25:54,975 --> 00:25:57,516
-when I got her.
-And Betty liked that?

260
00:25:58,508 --> 00:26:00,213
Betty was excited.

261
00:26:01,546 --> 00:26:04,774
One of nature's most meaningless creatures.

262
00:26:05,127 --> 00:26:08,127
You're aware that the choice of a dwarf hamster

263
00:26:08,128 --> 00:26:11,004
possibly suggests certain sexual connotations.

264
00:26:11,005 --> 00:26:12,614
I can see that now but

265
00:26:12,615 --> 00:26:15,107
it was really not a conscious choice.

266
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,224
Can you show me where the lavatory is?

267
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:29,477
I have...

268
00:26:29,478 --> 00:26:31,203
to blow my nose.

269
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,176
<i>We were running out of subjects,</i>

270
00:26:45,432 --> 00:26:47,265
<i>and B was ahead on points,</i>

271
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,914
<i>which led us to S' first-class compartment.</i>

272
00:26:55,455 --> 00:26:57,469
Tickets, please!

273
00:27:02,552 --> 00:27:05,023
Thank you.
Ladies,

274
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,476
tickets?

275
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,096
Well,

276
00:27:16,437 --> 00:27:20,092
- I think I might've lost it.
-Perhaps.

277
00:27:21,486 --> 00:27:23,638
Dropped yours as well, did ya?

278
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:27,229
I haven't bought a ticket for your shitty train.

279
00:27:27,795 --> 00:27:31,716
It's so bloody slow, we should've been at the end of the track half an hour ago.

280
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:34,329
Regardless of delays, you still need a ticket, sweetheart.

281
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,324
£8 each, please.

282
00:27:41,108 --> 00:27:43,973
Oh, I accidently tore it up.

283
00:27:43,974 --> 00:27:46,413
You can't expect be to pay for scraps of paper.

284
00:27:47,043 --> 00:27:49,180
-Have another one.
-Oh, great idea.

285
00:27:49,181 --> 00:27:51,961
Oh, that one's disappeared, too.

286
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:55,435
I can always just get the police to collect your payment at the next station. How about that?

287
00:27:55,436 --> 00:27:57,865
Now let's just take it easy here, shall we?

288
00:27:57,866 --> 00:28:00,273
Apparently, the young ladies have left without any money.

289
00:28:00,274 --> 00:28:02,266
If it's okay with you, I'd like to pay for their tickets.

290
00:28:02,267 --> 00:28:03,851
No, sir, it's not.

291
00:28:03,852 --> 00:28:06,228
Just leave your money where it is. We'll let the police deal with these two …

292
00:28:06,229 --> 00:28:10,427
Actually, we did have sort of an agreement that I was to pay. I just forgot about it.

293
00:28:13,838 --> 00:28:15,138
I see.

294
00:28:15,139 --> 00:28:17,439
Two first-class tickets

295
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:19,806
for two first-class ladies.

296
00:28:21,523 --> 00:28:23,967
Enjoy the rest of your journey.

297
00:28:25,765 --> 00:28:29,078
Tickets, please!

298
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:32,382
Now that you've been so nice to us,

299
00:28:34,099 --> 00:28:36,712
we'd like to be nice to you, too.

300
00:28:36,713 --> 00:28:39,643
Oh, that's very kind of you,
but there's no need.

301
00:28:43,566 --> 00:28:45,143
I mean that.

302
00:28:49,012 --> 00:28:51,003
I've already lost, anyway.

303
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:57,035
I'm willing to give you five extra points

304
00:28:59,555 --> 00:29:01,387
if you can get that one in there.

305
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,653
<i>I decided, perhaps a bit desperately,</i>

306
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:10,787
<i>that the only thing standing between me and the bag of chocolate sweets</i>

307
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:14,709
<i>was an unequivocal provocation of this man.</i>

308
00:29:15,263 --> 00:29:17,876
<i>Excellent! An 'induced take'!</i>

309
00:29:18,172 --> 00:29:20,318
<i>When all other attempts fail,</i>

310
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:24,112
<i>a dramatic provocation can get an otherwise completely passive fish to bite.</i>

311
00:29:24,113 --> 00:29:27,884
<i>They will react instinctively to the right provocation</i>

312
00:29:27,885 --> 00:29:30,384
which would not be a fly, but, for instance,

313
00:29:30,385 --> 00:29:32,122
a brightly coloured wobbler,

314
00:29:32,123 --> 00:29:33,667
preferably red.

315
00:29:33,668 --> 00:29:36,693
The very best is one we call the 'Finnish Weapon',

316
00:29:36,694 --> 00:29:38,687
the so-called Rappala.

317
00:29:41,582 --> 00:29:43,457
You've bought a gift.

318
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,296
Yes.

319
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:48,817
It's for my wife.

320
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,322
You travel first-class and

321
00:29:53,653 --> 00:29:55,059
you bought us our tickets.

322
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:59,663
Why then not buy a decent gift for your wife?

323
00:30:00,144 --> 00:30:02,234
I can see it comes from the station.

324
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:09,822
Of course, I should have...

325
00:30:10,345 --> 00:30:11,714
bought her something …

326
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,250
something better,

327
00:30:14,955 --> 00:30:17,948
but let's just say I was suddenly
in a hurry to get home.

328
00:30:18,546 --> 00:30:20,293
Why would a man

329
00:30:20,624 --> 00:30:21,913
like you

330
00:30:21,914 --> 00:30:24,971
with such an orderly life suddenly have to hurry?

331
00:30:28,404 --> 00:30:30,321
It has to do with family.

332
00:30:32,772 --> 00:30:35,094
My wife and I decided that we …

333
00:30:37,738 --> 00:30:40,487
we miss having children, after all,

334
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:43,900
and that if we are to have children, it has to be now.

335
00:30:45,616 --> 00:30:48,727
So my wife called yesterday to say that she …

336
00:30:49,485 --> 00:30:51,594
she started ovulating.

337
00:30:52,874 --> 00:30:56,801
And all signs point to maximum fertility precisely tonight.

338
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,113
You see,

339
00:30:59,647 --> 00:31:02,470
that's why I bought her
a gift at the station.

340
00:31:02,471 --> 00:31:05,294
I had to get a ticket home
as quickly as possible.

341
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,928
Well, I understand now.

342
00:31:09,547 --> 00:31:11,656
What is it you understand?

343
00:31:11,657 --> 00:31:14,096
Why you didn't have sex with us.

344
00:31:17,403 --> 00:31:20,365
It wasn't because I didn't want to.

345
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,543
Please …

346
00:31:42,284 --> 00:31:44,958
I'm begging you, please don't.

347
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:47,049
It's okay.

348
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,212
Please, don't.

349
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,390
You've been as horny as hell.

350
00:31:54,201 --> 00:31:56,312
But you wouldn't give up your load.

351
00:31:56,313 --> 00:31:58,604
Please, stop.

352
00:32:41,566 --> 00:32:42,940
Oh, fuck.

353
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:45,541
Wauw.

354
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,820
So oral sex...

355
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,713
became, in the eye of the angler, your …

356
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,380
your Finnish weapon.

357
00:33:06,464 --> 00:33:08,456
Is that your only comment?

358
00:33:10,034 --> 00:33:12,310
What else …
what else d'you want me to say?

359
00:33:14,052 --> 00:33:16,513
That I behaved reprehensively.

360
00:33:17,494 --> 00:33:20,456
That already my actions exemplify that I'm a …

361
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,577
that I'm a terrible human being.

362
00:33:23,238 --> 00:33:25,795
That's not the way I see it.

363
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,948
On the contrary, I saw it as a …

364
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,750
as a very pleasurable and humorous story.

365
00:33:31,123 --> 00:33:34,800
I've consciously used and hurt others

366
00:33:35,397 --> 00:33:37,932
for the sake of my own satisfaction.

367
00:33:38,326 --> 00:33:41,544
And what I've told you so far only begins to suggest that.

368
00:33:41,545 --> 00:33:43,972
But when you told the story, you were cheerful,

369
00:33:44,081 --> 00:33:45,420
full of humour.

370
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,772
The only thing you've done …

371
00:33:48,433 --> 00:33:52,120
except giving a few people an experience to remember is that you …

372
00:33:52,493 --> 00:33:54,688
you relieved S from his load.

373
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,098
In some … some youthful hubris.

374
00:33:59,889 --> 00:34:04,365
And I read somewhere that if you keep the load too long, the sperm will die.

375
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,368
Or worse, degenerate.

376
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:12,527
Maybe thanks to you, Mr. S and his wife now have a healthy and well-functioning child.

377
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:16,396
I discovered my power as woman

378
00:34:16,534 --> 00:34:19,621
and used it without any concern for others.

379
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,848
That's completely unacceptable.

380
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:23,750
Oh, little darling.

381
00:34:23,751 --> 00:34:25,408
Don't you 'little darling' me.

382
00:34:27,978 --> 00:34:29,301
No.

383
00:34:31,985 --> 00:34:33,840
What I wanted to say was that...

384
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,483
if you have wings, why not fly.

385
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,607
No more stories.

386
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,670
You need to sleep.

387
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:15,990
No, no.

388
00:35:16,628 --> 00:35:18,887
This is beginning to amuse me.

389
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,710
I don't even know your name.

390
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,850
My name is Joe.

391
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,489
I'm Seligman.

392
00:35:34,156 --> 00:35:36,914
What a fucking ridiculous name.

393
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,470
It's Jewish.

394
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,607
You said you weren't religious.

395
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,742
No, but my great-grandfather was.

396
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,886
And my parents gave me the name as a …
as a sort of

397
00:35:48,664 --> 00:35:51,477
sentimental association to Judaism.

398
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,940
But we've always been

399
00:35:53,941 --> 00:35:55,678
anti-Zionists.

400
00:35:56,872 --> 00:35:59,398
Which is not the same as being anti-Semitic,

401
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:03,340
as certain political powers try to convince us.

402
00:36:03,341 --> 00:36:05,254
Seligman

403
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,654
means 'the happy one'.

404
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,450
So, are you happy, then?

405
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,922
Well, I suppose I am.

406
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,087
In my own way.

407
00:36:22,163 --> 00:36:25,467
Even if I'm the sort of person who cuts the nails of the right hand first.

408
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,130
What does that mean?

409
00:36:27,982 --> 00:36:31,978
Well, I divide humanity into two groups: The people who cut the nails

410
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:36,113
of the left hand first and the people who cut the nails of the right hand first.

411
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,335
My theory is that the people who cut the nails of the left hand first, they … they …

412
00:36:40,336 --> 00:36:41,903
they're more light-hearted.

413
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,397
They have a tendency to enjoy life more

414
00:36:44,908 --> 00:36:47,708
because they go straight for the easiest task

415
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,215
and save their difficulties for later.

416
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,580
So what do you do?

417
00:36:58,375 --> 00:37:00,293
Always the left hand first.

418
00:37:00,602 --> 00:37:02,160
I don't think there's a choice.

419
00:37:03,575 --> 00:37:06,037
Go for the pleasure first, always,

420
00:37:06,778 --> 00:37:09,367
and then once you've done the left hand,

421
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,070
only the right hand remains,

422
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:14,408
and that's the easiest one left.

423
00:37:21,342 --> 00:37:23,292
I've never thought of it like that.

424
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,131
Well, you … you're never too old …

425
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,040
never too old to learn.

426
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,344
That's rugelach.

427
00:37:39,781 --> 00:37:42,221
Mm-hm. It's a Jewish cake.

428
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:46,101
-There's that sentimentality again.
-No, but it's more than rugelach.

429
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,701
It's rugelach served with a cake fork.

430
00:37:50,545 --> 00:37:53,123
Rugelach, in my opinion, is pastry,

431
00:37:53,124 --> 00:37:56,172
which there is no excuse for eating with a cake fork.

432
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,069
To serve it with a cake fork is

433
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:00,019
irritatingly unmanly,

434
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,575
not to say downright feminine.

435
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:08,181
However, it can bring us further with the story.

436
00:38:09,801 --> 00:38:11,402
I also knew someone

437
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,641
who consumed rugelach
every day,

438
00:38:14,642 --> 00:38:17,434
almost religiously, with a cake fork.

439
00:38:17,743 --> 00:38:20,738
And although we'll be jumping a bit in time,

440
00:38:22,197 --> 00:38:24,350
I have to tell you about Jerome.

441
00:38:25,234 --> 00:38:28,325
As far as I can see, the next chapter doesn't contain

442
00:38:28,326 --> 00:38:31,549
as direct an accusation against my person

443
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,086
as the rest of the story.

444
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,732
The chapter will also make a sentimental soul like you happy,

445
00:38:37,935 --> 00:38:39,260
as it contains

446
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,910
observations on the subject of love.

447
00:38:44,237 --> 00:38:47,010
CHAPTER TWO
JEROME

448
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,090
Can I tell you something?

449
00:39:47,357 --> 00:39:49,720
Sure. Sure.

450
00:39:49,796 --> 00:39:51,096
Yeah.

451
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,370
Yeah, sure.

452
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:55,008
It might not be important to you …
… but it is to me.

453
00:39:55,222 --> 00:39:56,560
… but it is to me.

454
00:39:58,111 --> 00:40:00,093
I've never had an orgasm before.

455
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,840
Really?

456
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,740
You're my first one.

457
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,596
You don't know how happy that makes me.

458
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,172
I love you.

459
00:40:26,251 --> 00:40:27,785
You're my first.

460
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,300
Well, I have to admit:

461
00:40:34,254 --> 00:40:35,917
Quite a lot of girls say that.

462
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,828
<i>The train trip had increased my appetite,</i>

463
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,278
<i>and soon B and I started a club</i>

464
00:40:44,279 --> 00:40:45,621
<i>that we called</i>

465
00:40:45,622 --> 00:40:47,140
'The Little Flock'.

466
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,280
Mea vulva, mea maxima vulva.

467
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:54,898
<i>B, of course, took the lead, as she was the most daring of us.</i>

468
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:57,125
She was raised Catholic.

469
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,233
I'm sure you're familiar with the practices

470
00:40:59,234 --> 00:41:00,700
of the Catholic Church.

471
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:03,560
...mea maxima vulva.

472
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,585
Mea vulva, mea maxima vulva.

473
00:41:05,586 --> 00:41:07,026
That's interesting.

474
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,260
Blasphemic, satanic.

475
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,190
The music.

476
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:14,496
The interval between B and F.

477
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,608
It's a tritone. The devil's interval.

478
00:41:18,482 --> 00:41:20,994
It was banned from music in the Middle Ages.

479
00:41:22,476 --> 00:41:24,895
Well, the Vacuum Cleaner invented it.

480
00:41:25,161 --> 00:41:27,026
She took piano lessons.

481
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,650
The Vacuum Cleaner?

482
00:41:28,838 --> 00:41:32,779
The Vacuum Cleaner possessed a special talent for floppy cocks.

483
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:36,583
She had some kind of vacuum in her cunt.

484
00:41:36,978 --> 00:41:39,578
I … I was imagining something like that.

485
00:41:40,388 --> 00:41:41,906
It was about fucking

486
00:41:41,907 --> 00:41:43,930
and about having the right to be horny.

487
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:48,350
We masturbated together, that kind of thing.

488
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,328
But it was rebellious.

489
00:41:53,592 --> 00:41:57,653
We weren't allowed to have boyfriends. No fucking the same guy more than once.

490
00:41:57,983 --> 00:41:59,614
What did you rebel against?

491
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,090
Love.

492
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,820
Love?

493
00:42:04,187 --> 00:42:06,179
We were committed to combat

494
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,418
the love-fixated society.

495
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,023
I really believed in our little flock,

496
00:42:24,024 --> 00:42:26,284
but of course, that was naive of me.

497
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,280
Over time,

498
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:31,826
even the strongest couldn't stay true to her manifest.

499
00:42:31,953 --> 00:42:33,290
3/5.

500
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:36,718
My third intercourse this week, again with Alex.

501
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:38,025
Third.

502
00:42:40,197 --> 00:42:42,766
Haven't we stated that we fuck each guy once?

503
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,600
I don't think...

504
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,366
you can understand Alex.

505
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,569
I don't want to.

506
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,787
-Our relationship …
-Relationship?

507
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,290
There you are.

508
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,070
You think...

509
00:42:55,246 --> 00:42:58,049
you know everything about sex.

510
00:43:01,843 --> 00:43:04,209
The secret ingredient to sex …

511
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:05,586
is love.

512
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,824
For me, love was just lust

513
00:43:13,888 --> 00:43:15,220
with jealousy added.

514
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:18,687
Everything else was total nonsense.

515
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,670
For every hundred crimes committed

516
00:43:21,671 --> 00:43:23,302
in the name of love,

517
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:26,073
only one is committed in the name of sex.

518
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,711
That's quite a statement.

519
00:43:28,903 --> 00:43:29,920
Well,

520
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,294
it all strengthened my wish for a serious education.

521
00:43:45,504 --> 00:43:46,840
Glasgow.

522
00:43:50,808 --> 00:43:52,293
Aberdeen.

523
00:43:53,534 --> 00:43:54,400
Why are you smiling?

524
00:43:55,516 --> 00:44:00,729
Oh, I just pictured how an education
would be conveyed in your storytelling.

525
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:03,884
Well, that's nothing to smile about.

526
00:44:04,651 --> 00:44:06,133
I understand that.

527
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:09,873
So what kind of education did you get?

528
00:44:10,917 --> 00:44:13,837
I began studying medicine like my father.

529
00:44:14,391 --> 00:44:17,801
But it was harder and harder for me to concentrate, so...

530
00:44:17,802 --> 00:44:19,743
I studied less and less

531
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:21,598
till finally, I dropped out.

532
00:44:23,516 --> 00:44:25,967
So instead,
I began to look for a job.

533
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:32,803
It turned out it was hard to get a job that paid even halfway decently.

534
00:44:34,274 --> 00:44:36,640
I didn't really know how to do anything,

535
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:41,454
so I didn't have high hopes when I applied for a position as an assistant

536
00:44:41,455 --> 00:44:42,904
at a printing house.

537
00:44:43,522 --> 00:44:46,954
So, could you tell me a little bit more about your

538
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:49,245
background?

539
00:44:49,491 --> 00:44:50,631
Um …

540
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:52,837
Education-wise.

541
00:44:52,901 --> 00:44:53,732
Well...

542
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:56,130
I finished high school

543
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:59,316
and decided to study medicine,

544
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,287
but I didn't finish.

545
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,387
-I know it sounds a bit pointless coming here.
-Right.

546
00:45:05,388 --> 00:45:07,519
I just really need a job

547
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,386
and I've tried everywhere.

548
00:45:09,387 --> 00:45:12,836
I don't usually give jobs to people just because they need one.

549
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:18,378
What about secretarial skills?
Do you have any of those?

550
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,234
No, I didn't think you needed skills.

551
00:45:21,653 --> 00:45:22,976
Wait..

552
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,733
You didn't think you needed skills

553
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,684
for this position as a secretary?

554
00:45:26,822 --> 00:45:27,962
No.

555
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,400
Can you open an envelope?

556
00:45:30,904 --> 00:45:33,634
Yeah, I … Yes, I think I can open an envelope.

557
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,011
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

558
00:45:36,874 --> 00:45:40,123
I shall discuss this conversation with Mr. Jerome,

559
00:45:40,124 --> 00:45:41,531
my boss.

560
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:46,923
Do you think there's a chance?

561
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:48,800
I doubt it.

562
00:46:09,093 --> 00:46:10,415
Well,

563
00:46:10,416 --> 00:46:11,864
apparently,

564
00:46:11,865 --> 00:46:14,199
having absolutely no experience

565
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:16,107
is absolutely fine for this job.

566
00:46:16,394 --> 00:46:17,950
You got it.

567
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,529
Oh. Does that mean I should
start tomorrow?

568
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,012
Yes, I suppose it does.

569
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:28,945
-Good morning.
-Right.

570
00:46:36,654 --> 00:46:37,976
Yes?

571
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,349
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

572
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:46,349
I just wanted to introduce you to our new junior secretary, Joe.

573
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,849
I believe you wanted to explain her work duties.
-Hi.

574
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:51,348
-This is the new junior secretary, sir.
-Liz, can I have another coffee?

575
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,220
-Yes, of course, sir.
-Thank you.

576
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,940
Hi

577
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:01,790
Jerome?

578
00:47:02,762 --> 00:47:04,100
Your first love.

579
00:47:09,274 --> 00:47:11,629
I bet you didn't think I'd make something of myself, right,

580
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:13,330
and now here I sit.

581
00:47:13,798 --> 00:47:15,855
The director's chair of M&J Morris Ltd.

582
00:47:19,638 --> 00:47:22,140
-Yes it's quite surprising
-Surprising.

583
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,060
It's a sign from God

584
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:30,550
You know, I've thought about you often since then.

585
00:47:32,085 --> 00:47:33,430
Have you thought of me?

586
00:47:36,322 --> 00:47:38,123
Well …

587
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,938
Usually, you know,
my uncle sits here,

588
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:45,488
but he's developed a bit of a tummy problem, so he's at the spa, taking long baths,

589
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,054
drinking lots of water. Poor guy.

590
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:48,609
And no-one knows for how long,

591
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:50,060
so now I'm J

592
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:51,550
in M&J Morris Ltd.

593
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:53,360
How about that?

594
00:47:53,566 --> 00:47:56,501
We print cards and envelopes, nonsense like that.

595
00:47:57,161 --> 00:47:59,228
It's a bloody complicated business, you know.

596
00:47:59,229 --> 00:48:00,796
I don't understand a word of it.

597
00:48:01,563 --> 00:48:03,034
Come, I'll show you around.

598
00:48:03,609 --> 00:48:04,909
Yes? Liz?

599
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:07,132
-Yes, sir.
-Oh, look, there you are.

600
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,480
Good job.

601
00:48:08,481 --> 00:48:10,444
Every time you do a good job,
I say, 'Good job, Liz.'

602
00:48:10,455 --> 00:48:11,882
-Thank you, sir.
-What's her name?

603
00:48:11,883 --> 00:48:13,843
-Liz.
-'Good job, Liz.'

604
00:48:13,844 --> 00:48:15,828
-'Good job, Liz.'
-Good job, Liz!

605
00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:18,200
This is Bobby.
Bobby, say hello, this is Joe.

606
00:48:18,201 --> 00:48:19,501
-Hello.
-He does the business cards.

607
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:35,120
It stopped.

608
00:48:35,462 --> 00:48:37,113
Fuck!

609
00:48:40,129 --> 00:48:41,410
Yes.

610
00:48:42,783 --> 00:48:45,479
-Well, isn't there an alarm?
-Which?

611
00:48:46,012 --> 00:48:48,366
-Isn't there an alarm?
-Alarm, right, yes.

612
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,910
Good thinking. I'll press this.

613
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,350
Imagine...

614
00:48:56,369 --> 00:48:58,560
you look just as great all these years later.

615
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,210
Oh, no!

616
00:49:02,883 --> 00:49:04,183
No.

617
00:49:04,784 --> 00:49:06,750
No?

618
00:49:08,614 --> 00:49:11,321
-No, Jerome, this won't work.
-Which won't work?

619
00:49:11,736 --> 00:49:13,239
This.

620
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:16,400
Why not?

621
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:18,986
You're not really my type.

622
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:22,470
That's how it's gonna be?

623
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:24,209
Yes.

624
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:25,550
All right.

625
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:33,230
Fuck's sake.

626
00:49:42,196 --> 00:49:43,519
Okay.

627
00:49:54,156 --> 00:49:55,485
Give me your hand.

628
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,504
Fireman's grip.

629
00:49:59,504 --> 00:50:01,250
-Uh! -You okay?
-Yeah.

630
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:06,678
Why didn't you have sex with him?

631
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:08,730
I'm not quite sure.

632
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:11,143
I've shagged lots of idiots.

633
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:14,402
-I suppose he fired you, then.
-No!

634
00:50:14,403 --> 00:50:17,309
If he had fired me, then he would've lost.

635
00:50:20,399 --> 00:50:23,861
<i>As I didn't recall anyone having defined my work duties,</i>

636
00:50:23,862 --> 00:50:25,428
<i>I decided to clean up</i>

637
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:27,761
<i>in order to smooth the waters.</i>

638
00:50:35,148 --> 00:50:36,449
Good morning, sir

639
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,385
-Any calls?
-No, sir.

640
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:45,690
What have you done?

641
00:50:46,973 --> 00:50:49,580
-Oh, I cleaned up.
-You cleaned up?

642
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:52,290
It was quite messy …

643
00:50:52,291 --> 00:50:53,591
-Liz?
-Yes, sir.

644
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:55,580
She cleaned up.

645
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:59,613
I know … I didn't know, sir, I was away from my desk.

646
00:50:59,614 --> 00:51:00,944
Are you completely mad?

647
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:08,769
What is the tea and pastry doing here?

648
00:51:09,494 --> 00:51:11,710
-I thought that was what you wanted for breakfast.
-You thought?

649
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,554
M-m, you're not supposed to think.

650
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,045
I don't pay you to think, do I?

651
00:51:15,046 --> 00:51:16,346
This is a do-over.

652
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:17,880
-A do-over?
-Right.

653
00:51:17,881 --> 00:51:19,181
Pick it up.

654
00:51:19,182 --> 00:51:20,937
Take it outside. And do it again.

655
00:51:33,395 --> 00:51:34,720
One moment.

656
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,370
Come in.

657
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,107
Would now be a good time for some tea and cake?

658
00:51:49,108 --> 00:51:50,359
Sure, why not.

659
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,460
Where the fuck is my cake fork?

660
00:51:54,607 --> 00:51:57,480
-Cake fork?
-Right.

661
00:51:56,429 --> 00:51:57,730
Well,

662
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,339
I would've got you one,

663
00:51:59,542 --> 00:52:01,000
but it just feels inappropriate.

664
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,030
Unmanly.

665
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,980
Feminine.

666
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:24,830
On the other hand, you must say that a cake fork is …

667
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,983
is a rather practical tool.

668
00:52:28,827 --> 00:52:30,624
It's like a cross between

669
00:52:30,677 --> 00:52:32,190
a knife and a fork.

670
00:52:32,414 --> 00:52:38,116
The point is that you're supposed to be able to hold the cake dish with one hand and then cut it with the other.

671
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:40,063
And then eat it

672
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,864
with the fork.

673
00:52:42,514 --> 00:52:45,114
It's not feminine; it's at least bourgeois.

674
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,321
It's said that the … the Bolsheviks

675
00:52:48,322 --> 00:52:50,340
during their rampage through Russia,

676
00:52:50,341 --> 00:52:52,579
to separate the men from the boys or rather

677
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:56,171
the bourgeoisie from the proletariat, they brought a boy,

678
00:52:56,288 --> 00:52:58,899
and before burning down a house, they sent him

679
00:52:59,059 --> 00:53:00,938
in to make sure they had cake forks.

680
00:53:05,596 --> 00:53:07,205
That's not true.

681
00:53:10,796 --> 00:53:12,667
I don't have the story first-hand.

682
00:53:12,838 --> 00:53:14,290
Hello.

683
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,908
-Hi.
-Hi.

684
00:53:16,909 --> 00:53:19,136
I was wondering if you could help me.

685
00:53:19,445 --> 00:53:21,800
It's suddenly gone very dirty.
Yeah.

686
00:53:23,581 --> 00:53:26,116
See, you put your dirty fingers on there.

687
00:53:26,117 --> 00:53:28,035
Maybe we should wash your hands.

688
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:29,805
Yeah, better.

689
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,274
You must be very talented.

690
00:53:35,275 --> 00:53:36,884
Yeah, sure.

691
00:53:44,906 --> 00:53:49,062
If you had asked Jerome, he would've said I was the one who had declared war.

692
00:53:51,109 --> 00:53:53,522
Many times he'd take me into town,

693
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:55,568
just so I could hold his coat.

694
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:56,910
There.

695
00:53:56,911 --> 00:53:58,211
Where?

696
00:53:58,212 --> 00:54:00,012
There, behind the green car.

697
00:54:02,623 --> 00:54:05,472
-It's not big enough.
-It is, there's plenty of space.

698
00:54:06,965 --> 00:54:08,830
I saw it.
It's not enough space.

699
00:54:08,836 --> 00:54:10,886
I'm telling you there's plenty of space.

700
00:54:14,785 --> 00:54:16,330
Fuck...

701
00:54:17,684 --> 00:54:18,950
No.

702
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:23,973
Can I try?

703
00:54:25,756 --> 00:54:27,099
Can you try?

704
00:54:27,653 --> 00:54:28,920
I'm a wizard at this.

705
00:54:28,921 --> 00:54:32,512
I just tried it. It's not enough space, Joe. You just saw me do it. There's not enough space.
Young Joe:
Can I try?
Jerome:
You wanna try? Why not?

706
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:33,705
Okay?

707
00:54:33,706 --> 00:54:35,189
Can I try?

708
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,689
You wanna try?

709
00:54:38,795 --> 00:54:40,170
Why not?

710
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,961
<i>It was about this time that a dramatic change</i>

711
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:31,039
<i>happened inside of me.</i>

712
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:34,716
<i>I could suddenly see</i>

713
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:37,114
<i>a kind of order in the mess.</i>

714
00:55:37,753 --> 00:55:40,128
It was all very, very wrong.

715
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:43,858
I wanted to be one of Jerome's things.

716
00:55:44,391 --> 00:55:46,309
I wanted to be picked up

717
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:49,357
and put down again and again.

718
00:55:50,164 --> 00:55:52,690
I wanted to be treated by his hands,

719
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,460
according to some

720
00:55:54,459 --> 00:55:57,475
sophisticated principle that I didn't understand.

721
00:55:58,090 --> 00:55:59,926
His strong hands?

722
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:04,078
Yes, but now it was no longer just about his hands.

723
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:06,956
It was as if everything about him was different.

724
00:56:07,702 --> 00:56:10,927
Which of course it wasn't, and I knew that in my head.

725
00:56:10,928 --> 00:56:13,250
And I scolded myself for seeing him

726
00:56:13,251 --> 00:56:14,660
in this new light.

727
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:16,950
Love is blind.

728
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:19,528
No, no, no, it's worse.

729
00:56:20,285 --> 00:56:22,232
Love distorts things.

730
00:56:22,903 --> 00:56:24,210
Or even worse,

731
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:25,833
love is something

732
00:56:25,834 --> 00:56:27,411
you've never asked for.

733
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,565
The erotic was something I asked for

734
00:56:30,566 --> 00:56:32,252
or even demanded of men.

735
00:56:33,212 --> 00:56:35,482
But this idiotic love...

736
00:56:36,952 --> 00:56:39,329
I felt humiliated by

737
00:56:40,107 --> 00:56:42,684
it and all the dishonesty that follows.

738
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,288
The erotic is about saying yes.

739
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:51,828
Love appeals to the lowest instincts,

740
00:56:52,137 --> 00:56:53,723
wrapped up in lies.

741
00:56:54,384 --> 00:56:56,930
How do you say yes when you mean no

742
00:56:56,931 --> 00:56:58,280
and vice versa?

743
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:04,201
I'm ashamed of what I became.

744
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,972
But it was beyond my control.

745
00:57:08,986 --> 00:57:10,460
You know what you're doing now?

746
00:57:11,597 --> 00:57:13,160
No, what am I doing?

747
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,442
You're defending your personality.

748
00:57:16,454 --> 00:57:18,682
I thought the point was to reveal it.

749
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:28,142
<i>At this time I took up walking again.</i>

750
00:57:28,143 --> 00:57:30,211
<i>I walked in the forest.</i>

751
00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:36,635
<i>The forest of my childhood.</i>

752
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,719
<i>I took the same walk again and again.</i>

753
00:57:42,721 --> 00:57:45,481
<i>Right turn after the gatehouse …</i>

754
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,050
<i>and right again by the ash tree,</i>

755
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:51,139
<i>which has the most beautiful leaves in the forest.</i>

756
00:57:52,279 --> 00:57:55,530
<i>And further on past the lady with her poodle</i>

757
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:58,683
<i>and the old man on the bench.</i>

758
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:08,219
<i>I couldn't free myself of the images of Jerome</i>

759
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:11,230
<i>and his careless elegance.</i>

760
00:58:18,057 --> 00:58:20,743
<i>And during this time, when I was with other men,</i>

761
00:58:21,052 --> 00:58:24,430
<i>I forbade them to touch my body with their hands.</i>

762
00:58:27,531 --> 00:58:28,850
<i>And soon</i>

763
00:58:28,873 --> 00:58:31,229
<i>I stopped having sex altogether.</i>

764
00:58:33,264 --> 00:58:35,662
<i>I tried to meet him all the time.</i>

765
00:58:36,014 --> 00:58:38,498
<i>I found out where he lived,</i>

766
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:41,887
<i>but of course never dared ring his doorbell.</i>

767
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,098
<i>I worked for a long time on a letter,</i>

768
00:58:47,269 --> 00:58:50,044
<i>in which I told him about my feelings for him.</i>

769
00:58:51,312 --> 00:58:55,021
<i>A month would pass before I had built up enough courage</i>

770
00:58:55,181 --> 00:58:56,530
<i>to deliver it.</i>

771
00:59:05,566 --> 00:59:07,239
I'm sorry. Isn't this

772
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,040
Jerome's office?

773
00:59:10,537 --> 00:59:15,695
I'm happy to say that this never has been and never will be Jerome's office.

774
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:20,193
But my nephew has been standing in for me while I've been unwell.

775
00:59:20,856 --> 00:59:23,190
Was that a letter for him?

776
00:59:23,847 --> 00:59:25,182
Yes.

777
00:59:25,183 --> 00:59:28,412
Give it to me and I'll make sure he gets it.

778
00:59:32,478 --> 00:59:34,811
Can't promise when that might be,

779
00:59:34,812 --> 00:59:36,528
as he's long gone.

780
00:59:37,722 --> 00:59:39,679
How the young finance their

781
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,241
irrepressible desire for travel is a mystery to me.

782
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:45,212
So, he's gone?

783
00:59:45,213 --> 00:59:47,067
Deserted us, yes.

784
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:51,670
Raving about a trip around the world and married and all.

785
00:59:51,742 --> 00:59:52,810
Married?

786
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,460
Married, yes.

787
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:57,902
Flown the coop with my secretary.

788
00:59:58,467 --> 00:59:59,948
Liz.

789
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:03,750
DAQUI PRA FRENTE É COM O MONTA

790
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:08,800
And your job?

791
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:14,670
It turned out that Jerome's uncle demanded a bit more knowledge about the business, so...

792
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:16,450
That was the end of love then?

793
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,040
Well, maybe it's not quite that simple.

794
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:25,717
But more about that later,

795
01:00:25,718 --> 01:00:27,630
as they say in the novels.

796
01:00:27,631 --> 01:00:30,372
And Jerome just disappeared?

797
01:00:30,761 --> 01:00:32,075
Yes.

798
01:00:32,076 --> 01:00:33,880
Though I tried to keep him,

799
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,090
in my own way, mentally,

800
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:39,680
as I masturbated on the train amongst other people.

801
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:43,619
You masturbated on the train?

802
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:45,620
-On the seat?
-Yes, of course.

803
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,940
I did a jigsaw puzzle.

804
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:55,260
A jigsaw puzzle?

805
01:00:59,370 --> 01:01:02,060
I found details in the other passengers

806
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:04,520
that reminded me of Jerome.

807
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,090
But in the long run,

808
01:01:45,091 --> 01:01:47,639
I couldn't hold on to the details of him,

809
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,710
no matter how hard I tried.

810
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:55,350
Maybe that's how it is with memory.
You... you remember silhouettes.

811
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:57,400
The essentials.

812
01:01:57,690 --> 01:01:59,980
But that's not necessarily a bad thing.

813
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:05,420
<i>Of course, as silhouettes in the winter,</i>

814
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,660
the trees are difficult to tell apart.

815
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:13,300
<i>My father wrestled courageously with his flora and tree type guides.</i>

816
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,920
It's actually

817
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:21,880
the souls of the trees that we see in the winter.

818
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:25,660
In the summer, everything is green and idyllic, but in the winter,

819
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:29,330
the branches and the trunks, they all stand out.

820
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,190
Just look at how crooked they all are.

821
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:36,210
The branches have to carry all of the leaves into the sunlight.

822
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:40,410
This is one long struggle for survival.

823
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:48,360
<i>My father surprised me by calling the naked trunks the souls of the trees.</i>

824
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:51,880
<i>A poetic thought that was rare for him,</i>

825
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:55,900
<i>as by his own account,
he preferred the empirical sciences.</i>

826
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,020
And after Jerome?

827
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:03,540
I reacted...

828
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,380
well, let's just say,

829
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:08,470
aggressively.

830
01:03:08,471 --> 01:03:09,771
How?

831
01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:13,230
By intensifying my hunt for men.

832
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:20,690
<i>You know these supermarket doors that open and close by way of some kind of sensor?</i>

833
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:27,820
<i>Now compare these doors to my cunt and add an extraordinarily sensitive sensor.</i>

834
01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:31,819
<i>My sensitive door opening</i>

835
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:35,850
gave me an opportunity to develop my morphological studies

836
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,740
from leaves to genitals.

837
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:47,140
<i>I embarked on a trip through what, in the link of children's books,</i>

838
01:03:47,141 --> 01:03:51,289
<i>one might call the country of the big black cocks,</i>

839
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:57,160
<i>the country of the small yellow cocks and so on.</i>

840
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:03,299
<i>And most of all, I battled my way through an untold number of circumcised cocks.</i>

841
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:09,455
<i>By the way, did you know that if you combine all the foreskin cut off through history …</i>

842
01:04:09,456 --> 01:04:12,810
<i>… it would reach to Mars and back again?</i>

843
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,190
<i>Mrs. H.</i>

844
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:52,060
<i>By now, I had built up a sizeable circle of men</i>

845
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:55,360
<i>and was starting to have trouble remembering who was who.</i>

846
01:04:55,361 --> 01:04:57,350
<i>Hello, sweetheart. Want to meet?</i>

847
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:02,093
<i>It's Fisher. I'm lying here, thinking of you and what you said.</i>

848
01:05:02,094 --> 01:05:04,485
<i>I'm not angry at all if that's what you think.</i>

849
01:05:04,486 --> 01:05:09,700
<i>Hey, Joe, it's Rob again. I had a really good time seeing you. Give me … give me a call.</i>

850
01:05:09,701 --> 01:05:14,493
<i>Hi, Joe, I left a couple of messages.
Is everything all right?</i>

851
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:18,490
<i>I quickly gave up trying to remember the individual relationships.</i>

852
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,979
<i>It was impossible</i>

853
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:24,170
<i>and impossible to predict what they wanted to hear.</i>

854
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,410
<i>So, I invented a method.</i>

855
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:32,790
<i>It was all based on chance.</i>

856
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:39,340
<i>A one meant an overly loving answer.</i>

857
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:46,329
<i>A two, not quite as passionate but still positive.</i>

858
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:49,680
<i>And so on up to five, which was a complete rejection.</i>

859
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:52,040
<i>And six, no answer at all.</i>

860
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:03,000
<i>Hey, Eddie, it's me.</i>

861
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:08,088
<i>Listen, I've given us a lot of thought, and I've come to the conclusion that we're done. Bye.</i>

862
01:06:08,990 --> 01:06:11,069
<i>The trick with this method was that</i>

863
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:14,230
<i>I didn't have to worry about the individual relationships …</i>

864
01:06:14,231 --> 01:06:16,431
Hi, Patrick, it's Joe.

865
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:19,390
<i>… but instead became completely unpredictable,</i>

866
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:21,980
<i>which of course drove the men even wilder.</i>

867
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:25,210
You're quite annoying,

868
01:06:25,610 --> 01:06:28,970
so I don't want to see you anymore.
Please, don't call back.

869
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:31,890
<i>That sounds rather stressful.</i>

870
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:33,760
<i>Yes, actually, it was.</i>

871
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:37,660
<i>But fortunately, I had my little book of comfort.</i>

872
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:41,940
<i>When I needed comfort or peace,</i>

873
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:44,370
<i>I took out my herbarium</i>

874
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:46,580
<i>and looked at my favourite leaves.</i>

875
01:06:47,472 --> 01:06:51,110
<i>Ash, trembling aspen and lime.</i>

876
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:02,409
When you're dealing with a larger group of lovers as I was,

877
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:05,250
<i>there will typically be a difference in their qualities.</i>

878
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,880
H was a sticky bastard.

879
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,390
You have to leave. I've got guests for dinner.

880
01:07:12,391 --> 01:07:13,891
But he's not coming till seven.

881
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:16,040
No,

882
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:18,440
but seven isn't that far away.

883
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:27,490
Do you love me?

884
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:32,210
<i>A was to arrive at seven,</i>

885
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,990
<i>and I needed to get H out of there.</i>

886
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:39,540
I love you too much.

887
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:45,289
You keep promising, but I understand now that you'll never leave

888
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:47,220
your family for my sake.

889
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:51,140
It's sad,

890
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:54,350
but it's your choice.

891
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,780
It's not satisfying for me that I can't have you completely.

892
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:04,960
Which is why we can't see each other any longer.

893
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,000
Goodbye.

894
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:22,480
And have a nice life.

895
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:49,280
My darling,

896
01:08:49,281 --> 01:08:51,040
I'm yours.

897
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,000
I've left her.

898
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:03,073
-Has he gone inside?
-Yes.

899
01:09:04,544 --> 01:09:06,498
Is the door closed?

900
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,430
-Uh, hello.
-Hello.

901
01:09:20,431 --> 01:09:22,770
I apologize.

902
01:09:22,771 --> 01:09:25,360
We had promised not to come up.

903
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,270
We just wanted

904
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:31,010
to make sure he got here safely, now that he's

905
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:33,620
made the big decision.

906
01:09:34,530 --> 01:09:36,230
May the children

907
01:09:36,331 --> 01:09:38,080
see him inside?

908
01:09:38,081 --> 01:09:39,381
Of course.

909
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,660
What a nice place.

910
01:09:56,610 --> 01:10:00,000
It's so bohemian.

911
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:05,100
Oh, that's right.

912
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:08,629
-You need the car key.
-Uh, no, I don't need the car.

913
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:10,010
Yes, you do.

914
01:10:10,511 --> 01:10:12,890
He likes the car.

915
01:10:15,970 --> 01:10:18,780
- Here. Please, just take it. -I don't want it.
-Just take it. -I don't want the fucking car!

916
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:24,550
It's all right.

917
01:10:24,551 --> 01:10:26,670
We'll get the bus home.

918
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:30,450
The children might as well get used to public transport now, right?

919
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,770
Of course,

920
01:10:32,771 --> 01:10:35,120
their standard of living won't be the same anymore, but...

921
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:45,430
-Hey. What's this?
-It's a present.

922
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:49,450
A pillow he has embroidered himself.

923
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:52,780
-And who's it for?
-Daddy.

924
01:10:55,030 --> 01:10:58,639
I do hope it's all right if the children call their father daddy here.

925
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,990
If you prefer, they can call him 'him'

926
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:06,440
"him" or simply 'the man'.

927
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:12,729
To be honest, my first thought was never, ever to let either of you see the children, but then I changed my mind.

928
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:17,860
I thought it only right that their father be confronted with the little people whose lives he has destroyed.

929
01:11:19,613 --> 01:11:21,610
Give Daddy your present.

930
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,660
It's a car the little dear has embroidered.

931
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,950
I'm aware that not everyone can see it,

932
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:34,790
but with the heart, one can see much,

933
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:37,930
however unimportant that information may be to you.

934
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:44,300
Would it be all right if I showed the children the whoring bed?

935
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:46,329
After all,

936
01:11:46,330 --> 01:11:48,480
they also had a stake in this event.

937
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:54,921
You need to see it, right?

938
01:11:54,922 --> 01:11:57,502
Let's go see Daddy's favourite place.

939
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:00,349
Come on, boys.

940
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:09,490
Oh, so this is where it all happened.

941
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:18,680
You should try to memorize this room,

942
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:21,180
especially the bed.

943
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,630
It'll stand you in good stead later in therapy.

944
01:12:24,870 --> 01:12:30,390
Oh, here I sit, rambling on about therapy without a thought of what it may cost.

945
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:33,430
I do hope you don't think we're here to beg.

946
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:38,420
I'm sorry.

947
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,420
I'm sorry.

948
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:43,330
I'm being silly. Mommy's being silly.

949
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,290
Let's have a cup of tea.

950
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:06,590
The children's father likes two lumps of sugar in his tea.

951
01:13:25,529 --> 01:13:26,865
I'll get it.

952
01:13:26,866 --> 01:13:28,800
No, no, no, please, please, please.

953
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:32,280
-Hello.
-Hello?

954
01:13:32,925 --> 01:13:34,280
Yes?

955
01:13:34,281 --> 01:13:36,230
-Uh.
-How nice!

956
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:38,220
Lovely.

957
01:13:38,290 --> 01:13:40,220
Boys, come here.

958
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:42,460
This might be interesting.

959
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:46,420
-This is my son. Yes.
-Yes. Hello, hello.

960
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:48,160
Look him in the eyes.

961
01:13:48,161 --> 01:13:50,899
-I'm Andy.
-Friend of Joe's, then?

962
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:52,670
-Yeah.
-You known each other long?

963
01:13:52,790 --> 01:13:54,860
Um, not that long, no.

964
01:13:54,861 --> 01:13:57,436
-Not very long?
-No.

965
01:14:05,050 --> 01:14:06,930
A ménage a trois.

966
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:10,590
It's all so exotic,

967
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:12,505
so...

968
01:14:12,506 --> 01:14:14,220
broad-minded.

969
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:17,210
On that point,

970
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:19,730
I failed.

971
01:14:19,790 --> 01:14:21,550
No doubt about it.

972
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:25,080
Boys,

973
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:27,190
now is the time to be alert

974
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:30,990
and ask all the questions your hearts desire.

975
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:33,840
Because

976
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,290
I hope

977
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:41,210
that you shall never have to encounter such people or be in such a situation ever again.

978
01:14:43,884 --> 01:14:46,030
Well? You don't have any questions?

979
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:52,590
No? Well, I'll start, shall I?

980
01:14:54,010 --> 01:14:55,900
Approximately how many lives

981
01:14:56,330 --> 01:14:59,090
do you think she has time to destroy in one day?

982
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:01,029
Five?

983
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:02,740
Fifty?

984
01:15:03,230 --> 01:15:05,140
Or several hundreds?

985
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:11,640
Look, this is just a big misunderstanding.

986
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:17,790
Boys,

987
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:22,679
I don't love your father.

988
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:27,130
She's just saying that to make us feel better. I'm sure you understand that.

989
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:30,630
Because if it were a joke, I mean,

990
01:15:33,110 --> 01:15:36,480
if this were really a joke, then it would be a joke so cruel...

991
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:45,180
No-one can be that cruel.

992
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:50,890
To destroy a mesh of feelings woven over 20 years

993
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:53,630
is no joke. I can assure you.

994
01:16:02,370 --> 01:16:04,080
Well,

995
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,080
if three's a crowd,

996
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:09,700
then seven must be a bit of a challenge for the pretty miss.

997
01:16:12,890 --> 01:16:16,550
I must say I have a hard time picturing her enjoying loneliness.

998
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:22,400
I think we better grab the chance to get away,

999
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:25,010
before things become grotesque.

1000
01:16:29,498 --> 01:16:31,829
No, no, no. Come back.

1001
01:16:33,434 --> 01:16:36,907
You wouldn't want to give your father a guilty conscience now, would you?

1002
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:57,350
So, how did this episode affect your life?

1003
01:16:58,170 --> 01:16:59,890
Not at all.

1004
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,220
Not at all?

1005
01:17:03,590 --> 01:17:05,310
No.

1006
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:08,140
You can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.

1007
01:17:12,450 --> 01:17:14,150
Yeah, that's true.

1008
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:19,150
Some people

1009
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:23,780
blame the addict.
Other people feel sorry for the addict.

1010
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:27,210
But I was an addict out of lust,

1011
01:17:27,370 --> 01:17:29,340
not out of need.

1012
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:31,960
You would say that, wouldn't you?

1013
01:17:32,710 --> 01:17:35,420
And lust that led to destruction around me.

1014
01:17:35,421 --> 01:17:37,690
Everywhere I went.

1015
01:17:38,830 --> 01:17:43,029
Well, addiction sometimes leads to a …

1016
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:45,180
an absence of empathy.

1017
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:51,377
You can't fight a lion and blow the noses of your children at the same time.

1018
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:55,580
For me, nymphomania was callousness.

1019
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:01,160
You're very stubborn.

1020
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:04,260
But what about yourself?

1021
01:18:04,850 --> 01:18:07,100
How did you feel during all this?

1022
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:18,580
Did you feel good,

1023
01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:20,560
or did you feel bad?

1024
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:29,710
Mrs. H was right about the loneliness.

1025
01:18:31,030 --> 01:18:34,690
I'd be lying if I said it hadn't been my constant companion.

1026
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,770
So, you were with all these men,

1027
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:41,830
and you still felt alone?

1028
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,270
I didn't want to tell you about it,

1029
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,200
but you've led me into a trap.

1030
01:18:57,930 --> 01:18:59,660
It was a certain feeling.

1031
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:09,033
Oh, how awful that everything has to be so trivial.

1032
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:20,890
<i>When I was seven, I had to have an operation.</i>

1033
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:24,000
<i>Nothing serious, but it did require anaesthesia.</i>

1034
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:28,799
<i>I had already been pre-medicated</i>

1035
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,980
<i>and was feeling all right.</i>

1036
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:36,630
<i>But when I looked into the room where the doctors and nurses were preparing for the operation,</i>

1037
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:40,660
<i>it was as if I had to pass through</i>

1038
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:42,339
<i>an impenetrable gate</i>

1039
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:44,400
<i>all by myself.</i>

1040
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:48,870
<i>It wasn't just that I missed my mum.</i>

1041
01:19:48,871 --> 01:19:51,050
<i>I don't think I missed my dad</i>

1042
01:19:51,210 --> 01:19:53,080
<i>even though he was the nice one.</i>

1043
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:57,650
<i>It was as if I was completely alone in the universe.</i>

1044
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:04,360
<i>As if my whole body was filled with loneliness and tears.</i>

1045
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:30,000
And I'm still not allowed to feel sorry for you?

1046
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:34,020
Shall we go on?

1047
01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:42,430
What are you reading?

1048
01:20:42,990 --> 01:20:44,780
I'm not reading really.

1049
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:48,080
I'm just reacquainting myself with Edgar Allan Poe.

1050
01:20:48,830 --> 01:20:50,560
I don't know him.

1051
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:53,420
No, well, he was a …

1052
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:57,010
a very anxiety-ridden man.

1053
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:04,680
He died in the most

1054
01:21:04,681 --> 01:21:06,720
fearful way you can imagine,

1055
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:08,980
in something called delirium tremors.

1056
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:16,080
It occurs when a long time abuse of alcohol is followed by …

1057
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:18,670
by sudden abstinence.

1058
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:23,950
Your body goes into some kind of hypersensitive shock.

1059
01:21:25,310 --> 01:21:29,080
You can see the most horrifying hallucinations

1060
01:21:29,370 --> 01:21:31,429
like rats and snakes

1061
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:33,880
and cockroaches coming out of the floor

1062
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:36,230
and worms slithering the walls.

1063
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:42,460
One's entire nervous system is on high alert

1064
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:45,100
and you have a constant panic and paranoia.

1065
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:49,300
And then the circulatory system fails.

1066
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:52,720
But the panic and horror

1067
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:55,570
remains until the moment of death.

1068
01:22:11,470 --> 01:22:13,260
I know what delirium is.

1069
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:21,990
<i>“During the whole of a dull, dark and soundless day in the autumn of the year,</i>

1070
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:25,820
<i>when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens,</i>

1071
01:22:26,530 --> 01:22:28,290
<i>I had been passing alone,</i>

1072
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:32,070
on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country;

1073
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:34,990
and at length found myself,

1074
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,140
as the shades of the evening drew on,

1075
01:22:37,630 --> 01:22:41,290
<i>within view of the melancholy House of Usher."</i>

1076
01:22:42,325 --> 01:22:48,670
<u>capítulo quatro
delírio</u>

1077
01:23:10,269 --> 01:23:12,002
Hey, Dad.

1078
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:24,660
Hey, luv.

1079
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:28,140
How are you?

1080
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:31,160
I fought with Mum.

1081
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:35,530
She's... she's not coming.

1082
01:23:39,370 --> 01:23:41,600
You ought not to fight with her.

1083
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:44,150
You know Kay's fear of hospitals.

1084
01:23:47,614 --> 01:23:49,529
I know she's not coming.

1085
01:23:49,629 --> 01:23:52,542
We already said everything we needed to say.

1086
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:56,840
Kay and I said goodbye at home.

1087
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:00,100
I don't want her here at all.

1088
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:05,700
I can't accept that.

1089
01:24:06,613 --> 01:24:08,389
You'll have to.

1090
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:10,850
She's a cowardly, stupid bitch.

1091
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:14,400
No, she's not.

1092
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:17,400
-Yes.
-No, she's not.

1093
01:24:17,401 --> 01:24:18,775
-Yes.
-No, she's not.

1094
01:24:18,776 --> 01:24:21,301
Yes, she is, and you've never understood that.

1095
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:37,350
Doesn't it scare you?

1096
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:40,720
No. No.

1097
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:49,690
How can you not be afraid?

1098
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:56,550
I've seen so many die.

1099
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:00,390
And then there's

1100
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:03,320
that Epicurus quote about not fearing death.

1101
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:07,750
When we are, death has not come.

1102
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:10,990
When death has come,

1103
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:13,430
we are not.

1104
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:18,910
I know what's going to happen.

1105
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:22,460
I also know all the drugs the doctors have to offer.

1106
01:25:22,959 --> 01:25:24,259
So no,

1107
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:26,990
I am not …

1108
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:28,990
I am not afraid.

1109
01:25:32,211 --> 01:25:33,920
You beautiful girl.

1110
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:37,200
Beautiful Dad.

1111
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:02,990
-K-Kay!
-Take it easy!

1112
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:06,010
Kay...

1113
01:26:23,490 --> 01:26:25,240
It's gonna be okay.

1114
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:46,650
Don't you want to take a little walk?

1115
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:49,530
I'll, um, stay with your father in the meantime.

1116
01:26:50,091 --> 01:26:51,428
You'll stay?

1117
01:26:51,429 --> 01:26:53,590
-You'll stay here?
-Yes.

1118
01:27:35,117 --> 01:27:37,139
Ash tree leaves.

1119
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:40,880
Where did you find them?

1120
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:43,310
They were in the park.

1121
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,840
It truly is the most beautiful tree in the forest.

1122
01:27:57,780 --> 01:27:59,540
But Dad,

1123
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:02,710
how do you recognize it in winter?

1124
01:28:03,730 --> 01:28:06,036
I've told you a hundred times.

1125
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,460
I can't remember.

1126
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:15,860
When the ash tree was created,

1127
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,860
it made all the other trees in the forest jealous.

1128
01:28:23,050 --> 01:28:24,750
It was the most

1129
01:28:27,290 --> 01:28:30,175
beautiful tree in the forest.

1130
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:34,450
It had the strongest wood.

1131
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,550
It was

1132
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:40,687
the World Tree in Norse mythology.

1133
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:44,070
You couldn't say anything bad about it.

1134
01:28:46,770 --> 01:28:48,540
And

1135
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:50,480
then when all the other trees

1136
01:28:50,850 --> 01:28:53,900
saw the ash tree with

1137
01:28:53,901 --> 01:28:55,201
its black buds,

1138
01:28:56,470 --> 01:28:58,690
they all started laughing.

1139
01:28:58,990 --> 01:29:00,790
'Oh, look,'

1140
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:04,920
the ash tree's had its fingers in the ashes.'

1141
01:29:23,271 --> 01:29:24,601
Daddy!

1142
01:29:24,602 --> 01:29:28,330
-Whats?
-Daddy, what's wrong?

1143
01:29:31,118 --> 01:29:34,478
It's me, it's me. What's wrong?
What's wrong? It's me.

1144
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:36,579
Help! Help!

1145
01:29:39,318 --> 01:29:40,618
Okay.

1146
01:29:41,619 --> 01:29:42,919
Okay.

1147
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:44,220
It's okay.

1148
01:29:45,521 --> 01:29:46,821
OKay. It's okay.

1149
01:29:46,822 --> 01:29:48,122
It's allright.

1150
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:53,184
Get the doctor. It's all right.

1151
01:30:03,244 --> 01:30:04,735
We have to fixate him.

1152
01:30:04,736 --> 01:30:06,635
What're you doing?

1153
01:30:07,094 --> 01:30:08,867
What are you doing to me?

1154
01:30:13,523 --> 01:30:17,045
Joe!
What are you doing to me?

1155
01:30:34,459 --> 01:30:36,559
Joe! Joe!

1156
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:39,890
You should take a break.

1157
01:31:41,067 --> 01:31:46,165
Excuse me.
Can you help me to clean...

1158
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:51,263
Okay, Mr.??, don't worry.


1159
01:31:51,264 --> 01:31:53,464
We're going to have to change the sheets. 

1160
01:32:38,762 --> 01:32:40,612
Ready?

1161
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,260
When he died,

1162
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:44,390
I had no feelings left.

1163
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:47,750
Well, that's certainly understandable.

1164
01:33:48,450 --> 01:33:51,460
No. I don't know what happened to me.

1165
01:33:52,570 --> 01:33:54,520
It was very shameful.

1166
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:57,110
Shameful?

1167
01:33:57,390 --> 01:33:59,280
I don't understand.

1168
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:25,990
I lubricated.

1169
01:34:41,310 --> 01:34:44,710
I know you like to present yourself in a negative way and that you have this

1170
01:34:44,770 --> 01:34:48,110
kind of dark bias that you're worse than everyone else.

1171
01:34:48,590 --> 01:34:50,760
But this story doesn't add to that belief.

1172
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:56,030
It's extremely common to react sexually in a crisis.

1173
01:34:57,050 --> 01:34:58,830
It may be shameful to you,

1174
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:02,300
but in literature, there's many worse examples.

1175
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:31,850
You listen to music, I see?

1176
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:35,440
Yes. I like it a lot.

1177
01:35:36,110 --> 01:35:37,960
Should I find a tape?

1178
01:35:38,110 --> 01:35:41,990
No, if there's a tape already in the machine, I'd like to hear that.

1179
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:44,310
It's something I've been listening to a lot lately

1180
01:35:44,470 --> 01:35:47,390
though it's not an entirely complete recording, unfortunately.

1181
01:35:47,890 --> 01:35:49,660
What is it?

1182
01:35:49,662 --> 01:35:53,770
It's Bach. From his little organ book.

1183
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:57,130
'Ich ruf' zu dir, herr Jesu Christ.'

1184
01:36:00,030 --> 01:36:02,170
The theme is originally a hymn,

1185
01:36:02,950 --> 01:36:04,770
but Bach rearranged it

1186
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:06,670
and embellished it a little.

1187
01:36:07,450 --> 01:36:10,320
He was the master of polyphony if you know what that is.

1188
01:36:10,321 --> 01:36:12,780
No, yet another thing I don't know.

1189
01:36:13,150 --> 01:36:14,850
Polyphony is...

1190
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:18,540
from the Middle Ages. It's an entirely European phenomenon.

1191
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:21,830
It's distinguished by … by the idea that

1192
01:36:21,990 --> 01:36:25,640
every voice is its own melody

1193
01:36:26,213 --> 01:36:28,900
but together in harmony.

1194
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,369
Bach's forerunner, Palestrina, he …

1195
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:34,360
he wrote many works

1196
01:36:34,410 --> 01:36:36,230
for several choirs at the same time,

1197
01:36:36,231 --> 01:36:39,190
wallowing in polyphony.

1198
01:36:48,650 --> 01:36:53,260
But in my eyes, Bach perfected the melodic expression and the harmony and also...

1199
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:56,320
also mixed up with some

1200
01:36:56,950 --> 01:37:00,610
rather incomprehensible mystique regarding numbers,

1201
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:04,120
most likely based on the Fibonacci sequence.

1202
01:37:06,110 --> 01:37:09,180
You know the one that starts with a zero, then comes the one.

1203
01:37:10,410 --> 01:37:13,615
The sequence is created by adding the two previous numbers

1204
01:37:13,616 --> 01:37:17,020
to create the new ones, so it's zero plus one makes one, and one plus one makes two,

1205
01:37:17,021 --> 01:37:20,425
and two plus one makes three, and three plus two makes five,

1206
01:37:20,426 --> 01:37:24,230
and five plus three makes eight, and eight plus five makes 13.
Seligman VO
The sequence has an interesting connection to Pythagoras' theorem and the Golden Section.
It was all about finding a divine methodology in art and architecture. A bit like the way tritone, which was played on the piano in your little club, was supposed to be a satanic interval. The sum of the numeric values represented in Bach's name is 14, a number he often used in his compositions.
Seligman:
The clever thing about Bach's name is that the numeric value of the individual letters are all Fibonacci numbers.
This piece has three voices: A bass voice, the second voice played with the left hand, the first voice played with the right hand. That is called cantus firmus or cantus firmus. And together, these three voices create the polyphony.
Joe:
Normally, a nymphomaniac is seen as someone who can't get enough and therefore has sex with many different people. That of course is true, but if I'm to be honest, I see it precisely as the sum of all these different sexual experiences. So in that way, I have only one lover.

01:37:48,570 --> 01:37:50,630
a number he often used in his compositions.

1214

This piece has three voices:

1218
01:38:03,030 --> 01:38:04,770
A bass voice,

1219
01:38:10,099 --> 01:38:12,230
the second voice played with the left hand,

1220
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:18,360
the first voice played with the right hand.

1221
01:38:18,930 --> 01:38:21,550
That is called cantus firmus or cantus firmus.

1222
01:38:21,650 --> 01:38:24,110
And together, these three voices

1223
01:38:24,111 --> 01:38:26,400
create the polyphony.

1224

01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:34,970
as someone who can't get enough

1226
01:38:36,070 --> 01:38:40,450
and therefore has sex with many different people.
That of course is true,

1227
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:42,220

different sexual experiences.

1231

So in that way,

1232
01:38:52,870 --> 01:38:55,040
I have only one lover.

chapter five
the little organ school

1234
01:38:59,341 --> 01:39:04,910
Since the music has three voices,
I will limit myself to talking about three lovers.

1235
01:39:06,490 --> 01:39:07,890
The bass is easy:

1236
01:39:07,891 --> 01:39:09,760
That's F.

1237
01:39:09,950 --> 01:39:11,340
F had a red car

1238
01:39:11,341 --> 01:39:13,740
that he'd bought used.

1239
01:39:15,890 --> 01:39:21,190
As I was having sex with seven or eight men every night at the time,

1240
01:39:21,390 --> 01:39:23,110
scheduling was tricky,

1241
01:39:23,310 --> 01:39:25,910
and they all had to have precise appointments.

1242
01:39:26,430 --> 01:39:28,610
F was a good man.

1243
01:39:29,310 --> 01:39:31,710
If he was scheduled for ten o'clock,

1244
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,019
he always showed up around nine

1245
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:35,810
and parked down in the street.

1246
01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:38,240
I always smiled when I saw him.

1247
01:39:39,860 --> 01:39:43,349
Often I took pity on him and gave him a cup of coffee

1248
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:45,800
while I was finishing with the one before.

1249
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:51,180
It's hard to say why I'm choosing to talk about F,

1250
01:39:50,881 --> 01:39:53,140
but he was reassuring,

1251
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:56,680
and he knew exactly what I wanted when we had sex.

1252
01:39:57,530 --> 01:39:59,670
No, I'd go even further

1253
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:04,000
and say that there was a kind of telepathy going on when we had sex.

1254
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:06,799
Without words,

1255
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:09,110
he knew exactly what I wanted,

1256
01:40:09,350 --> 01:40:12,790
where he should touch me and what he should do.

1257
01:40:14,110 --> 01:40:16,440
The most sacred goal for F

1258
01:40:16,610 --> 01:40:18,400
was my orgasm.

1259
01:40:18,860 --> 01:40:21,610
And then,

1260
01:40:21,890 --> 01:40:23,779
the swans answered

1261
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:25,840
in the same voice.

1262
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:29,440
And granted him privileges none of the others received.

1263
01:40:36,140 --> 01:40:41,640
F was the bass voice: monotone, predictable and ritualistic,

1264
01:40:41,641 --> 01:40:47,740
no doubt about it. But also the foundation that is so important

1265
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:50,520
even if, on its own, it doesn't mean much.

1266
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:24,410
G was quite different.

1267
01:41:25,110 --> 01:41:28,540
The only one I had to and wanted to wait for.

1268
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:33,119
When he finally turned up and I opened the door,

1269
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:34,880
he didn't immediately enter,

1270
01:41:35,370 --> 01:41:38,090
the way a cat doesn't when you let it in,

1271
01:41:38,290 --> 01:41:40,720
as if once the door is opened,

1272
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:42,700
it has all the time in the world.

1273
01:41:49,340 --> 01:41:51,390
But he was more than a cat.

1274
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:55,140
He was like some kind of a jaguar or leopard.

1275
01:41:56,390 --> 01:41:58,560
He moved like them,

1276
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:00,380
which turned me on no end.

1277
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:14,650
He was in charge.
That was the way it was.

1278
01:43:08,490 --> 01:43:12,395
Despite my success in managing the complicated logistics

1279
01:43:12,396 --> 01:43:14,829
involved in arranging up to ten

1280
01:43:14,830 --> 01:43:17,080
daily sexual satisfactions

1281
01:43:17,350 --> 01:43:19,650
while also having a full-time job,

1282
01:43:20,070 --> 01:43:22,830
I was still prone to a certain sadness.

1283
01:43:23,260 --> 01:43:25,720
So when my busy life allowed a few breaks,

1284
01:43:26,010 --> 01:43:28,030
I used them to take my walks.

1285
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:33,450
These repeated walks became a kind of metaphor for my life:

1286
01:43:33,610 --> 01:43:35,510
monotonous and pointless.

1287
01:43:37,971 --> 01:43:41,670
Yes, precisely like the movements of a caged animal.

1288
01:43:43,230 --> 01:43:46,200
Basically, we're all waiting for permission to die.

1289
01:44:52,810 --> 01:44:54,830
No. No, no, no.

1290
01:44:55,690 --> 01:44:59,940
No, there are some completely unrealistic coincidences in your story about Jerome.

1291
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:04,140
First, by chance, he hires you as...

1292
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:10,210
as an assistant and then you take a walk in a forest that is littered with photographs of him, and not only that,

1293
01:45:10,490 --> 01:45:12,220
he's present.

1294
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:14,729
And then like a God

1295
01:45:14,730 --> 01:45:16,740
pulls you up to him through the clouds.

1296
01:45:17,766 --> 01:45:19,653
Goodness gracious.

1297
01:45:21,090 --> 01:45:23,739
Jerome was there because he had just had a fight with his wife,

1298
01:45:23,740 --> 01:45:28,540
who, in anger, tore up the photographs they just had developed from their travels.

1299
01:45:28,541 --> 01:45:31,174
I don't know if I can believe this…

1300
01:45:31,175 --> 01:45:33,690
Which way do you think you'd get the most out of my story?

1301
01:45:33,870 --> 01:45:36,320
By believing in it or by not believing in it?

1302
01:45:37,701 --> 01:45:39,065
You're right.

1303
01:45:39,066 --> 01:45:40,750
You might have a point with all this.

1304
01:45:44,770 --> 01:45:48,742
The secret ingredient to sex is love.

1305
01:45:52,310 --> 01:45:55,320
The third voice.
The secret ingredient.

1306
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:57,290
Cantus firmus.

1307
01:47:14,066 --> 01:47:16,738
Fill all my holes.

1308
01:48:13,410 --> 01:48:16,240
What's wrong?

1309
01:48:18,116 --> 01:48:20,509
-I can't feel anything.
-Huh?

1310
01:48:20,510 --> 01:48:22,575
I can't feel anything.

1311
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:26,944
I can't feel anything.

1312
01:48:28,786 --> 01:48:32,192
I can't... anything.

1313
01:48:36,370 --> 01:48:39,070
END OF VOLUME I
