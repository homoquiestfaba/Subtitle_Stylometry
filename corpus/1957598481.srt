1
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,100
Woman narrating: MY NAME IS MRS. BASIL E. FRANKWEILER

2
00:00:57,134 --> 00:00:58,933
AND I HAVE A STORY TO TELL.

3
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:01,366
IT BEGINS WITH AN INVITATION I RECEIVED

4
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,333
TO ATTEND A PRIVATE AUCTION.

5
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:07,967
A FEW ELITE ART COLLECTORS, NOT TO MENTION A MUSEUM OR TWO,

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,900
WERE GATHERED TOGETHER TO EXCHANGE ONE ANOTHER'S TREASURES.

7
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:14,333
I WENT THERE THAT DAY NOT TO BUY

8
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:17,134
BUT TO SELL SOMETHING VERY DEAR TO ME,

9
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:19,400
SOMETHING WITH A SECRET,

10
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:22,300
A SECRET I HAVE KEPT FOR MANY YEARS.

11
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,566
NUMBER NINE IN YOUR CATALOGUE, AN UNDOCUMENTED SCULPTURE,

12
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,299
POSSIBLY QUARRIED FROM THE SAME MARBLE

13
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,800
USED BY MICHELANGELO,

14
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:47,533
IF IN FACT NOT SCULPTED BY THE MASTER HIMSELF.

15
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,600
THE COLLECTOR WISHES TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS

16
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:53,067
AND I HAVE ON THE BOOKS A BID OF $25,000.

17
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,366
WHO WILL OPEN THE BIDDING AT $30,000?

18
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,333
THANK YOU. $30,000.

19
00:01:58,366 --> 00:02:00,500
DO I HEAR $35,000?

20
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:02,100
$35,000. THANK YOU, INDEED.

21
00:02:02,134 --> 00:02:05,200
DO I HEAR 45? $45,000 IN THE BACK.

22
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:06,566
THANK YOU.

23
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,900
45. NOW $55,000.

24
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:11,733
THANK YOU. NOW 65.

25
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:16,266
DOWN FRONT HERE, 65. DO I HEAR $75,000?

26
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:21,933
$75,000. NOTHING FURTHER. AND--

27
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:25,466
SOLD TO NUMBER 115. THANK YOU, SIR.

28
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,600
Mrs. Frankweiler: SO NOW THE FUN WOULD BEGIN.

29
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:29,700
BUT NEVER IN MY WILDEST DREAMS

30
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,933
DID I IMAGINE THE SALE OF MY MYSTERIOUS SCULPTURE

31
00:02:32,967 --> 00:02:34,933
WOULD BRING ME THE ACQUAINTANCE

32
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:37,433
OF THE MOST REMARKABLE TWO CHILDREN.

33
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:45,867
DOESN'T IT EVER DAWN ON YOU TO SAY, "THANK YOU, CLAUDIA.

34
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,134
I APPRECIATE THAT YOU MAKE MY LUNCH"?

35
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:51,667
TO SAY, "THE LITTLE NOTE YOU WROTE ME WITH MY CARROTS WAS THOUGHTFUL AND NICE"?

36
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,167
THAT NOTE WAS EMBARRASSING. AND I HATE CARROTS!

37
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,167
WELL THEN, LITTLE BROTHER, YOUR EYES ARE GONNA ROT AND FALL OUT OF YOUR HEAD.

38
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,299
BETTER THAN BEING A RABBIT.

39
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:04,933
MOVE, STEVE. I NEED TO SET THE TABLE.

40
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:06,433
HEY, DO YOU MIND? I'M STUDYING.

41
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:09,266
STUDY IN YOUR ROOM. OR CAN'T YOU FIND YOUR DESK IN THE MESS?

42
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:11,100
MOM, GIVE CLAUDIA SOMETHING ELSE TO DO.

43
00:03:11,134 --> 00:03:13,700
- MOM! - WHY DON'T YOU MOVE YOUR BOOKS INTO THE FAMILY ROOM?

44
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:15,733
I CAN'T. THERE'S LAUNDRY EVERYWHERE.

45
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:17,466
CLAUDIA, PUT THE LAUNDRY AWAY FIRST

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,967
AND THEN YOU CAN SET THE TABLE.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,933
WHY DO I ALWAYS HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING--

48
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,933
DON'T START, CLAUDIA. YOUR FATHER'S ON HIS WAY HOME FROM WORK,

49
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:25,100
I'VE GOT TAX DOCUMENTS TO FINISH FOR A CLIENT.

50
00:03:25,134 --> 00:03:27,433
NOW YOU'VE DONE YOUR HOMEWORK; THE OTHERS HAVEN'T.

51
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:30,433
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR BEING A GENIUS.

52
00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:34,067
WHEN BOTH PARENTS WORK, SOMEONE HAS TO HELP.

53
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:38,633
IT'S A ROUGH LIFE.

54
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:44,100
Boy: PLEASE, DAD.

55
00:03:44,134 --> 00:03:46,667
JAMIE, WE'RE NOT GIVING YOU SKYDIVING LESSONS

56
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,500
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY AND THAT'S FINAL.

57
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:50,200
- I FOUND THE INSTRUCTIONS. - GOOD.

58
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:53,100
- BUT, DAD-- - JAMIE, JUST FORGET IT.

59
00:03:53,134 --> 00:03:57,233
I STILL DON'T SEE WHY THEY CAN'T BE A BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

60
00:03:57,266 --> 00:03:59,233
WHY DON'T YOU LET HIM BUY THEM HIMSELF?

61
00:03:59,266 --> 00:04:01,299
HE HAS MORE MONEY THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE FAMILY.

62
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,299
NO ONE IN THIS FAMILY IS SKYDIVING.

63
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:07,933
AND CLAUDIA'S BIRTHDAY COMES BEFORE ANYONE ELSE'S.

64
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:09,299
CLAUDIA?

65
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,533
I WANT A FOUR-POSTER BED WITH AN AWNING

66
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:16,266
AND A MATCHING DUST RUFFLE.

67
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,067
Steven: COME ON, CLAUD.

68
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,600
YOU DON'T JUST WANT THE BED.

69
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:22,767
YOU WANT TO ACTUALLY LIVE IN THE 17th CENTURY.

70
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,100
YEAH, THAT WAY SHE'LL BE A PRINCESS.

71
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:26,933
( all laugh )

72
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,067
Mother: HEY.

73
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,466
BOYS.

74
00:04:40,466 --> 00:04:43,433
Claudia: HERE'S THE PROBLEM:

75
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:46,366
I DO EVERYTHING RIGHT.

76
00:04:52,366 --> 00:04:55,967
NOBODY APPRECIATES ME.

77
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:06,433
MY FATHER HARDLY KNOWS I'M ALIVE.

78
00:05:06,466 --> 00:05:09,034
MY BROTHERS THINK I'M JUST A BRAIN

79
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:12,900
AND MY MOTHER THINKS I CAN DO EVERYTHING AT ONCE.

80
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:20,433
THE TIME HAS COME TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

81
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,000
I JUST WISH I KNEW WHAT.

82
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:55,167
HMM.

83
00:06:03,366 --> 00:06:04,633
Boy: CATCH YOU LATER!

84
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:06,867
Boy #2: GREAT GAME TODAY!

85
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,533
Driver: STEP RIGHT UP! WE'RE WAITING.

86
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,366
SEE YOU HAD SOME PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY.

87
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:26,967
MOVE, BRUCE. I NEED TO TALK TO JAMIE.

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,933
TODAY, BRUCE.

89
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:30,633
I'M GLAD SHE'S NOT MY SISTER.

90
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:31,800
Both: THOU SHALT NOT SHUFFLE.

91
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,466
( both spit )

92
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,933
Driver: LET'S GET YOUR SEATS.

93
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:37,200
ALL RIGHT.

94
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:39,633
HERE WE GO. TIME TO CAST OFF.

95
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,299
JAMES LINCOLN KINCAID, I'M DELIGHTED TO TELL YOU

96
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,299
YOU'VE BEEN CHOSEN TO ACCOMPANY ME

97
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,767
ON THE GREATEST ADVENTURE OF OUR MUTUAL LIVES.

98
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,134
GREAT. WHO BY?

99
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:54,067
WHO BY?

100
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,633
YEAH. WHO CHOSE ME?

101
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:59,134
"BY WHOM," JAMIE. "BY WHOM WAS I CHOSEN?"

102
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:00,633
WAIT A MINUTE.

103
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:02,633
YOU STOPPED ME PLAYING CARDS WITH BRUCE

104
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:04,233
TO PLAY A WORD GAME?

105
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:06,933
I CHOSE YOU, JAMIE.

106
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:09,000
I CHOSE YOU BECAUSE

107
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:13,034
YOU AND I ARE GOING TO RUN AWAY.

108
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:14,967
HUH?

109
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,767
THE TRUTH IS, OUR PARENTS NO LONGER SEE ME AS A PERSON,

110
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,800
RATHER AS AN INITIAL ON THE CHORE CALENDAR.

111
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,299
YEAH-- "C."

112
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,500
THEY DON'T CARE THAT I GET STRAIGHT As

113
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:33,034
AND AS THE ONLY GIRL, I'M ACTUALLY SUBJECTED TO THE MOST INJUSTICE.

114
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:35,034
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE TERM

115
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:37,034
"ABSENCE MAKES THE HEART GROW FONDER"?

116
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:38,800
MMM... NO.

117
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,034
JAMIE, WE LEAVE TOMORROW

118
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:42,867
BECAUSE IT'S MUSIC LESSON DAY

119
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,667
AND THE BEST PLACE TO PACK OUR CLOTHES IS IN OUR INSTRUMENT CASES.

120
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,466
YOU HAVEN'T SAID WHY YOU WANT TO TAKE ME.

121
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,466
Steve: HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS UP TO?

122
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,767
HUH?

123
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
LATER.

124
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:57,566
HI, STEVE.

125
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,466
WHAT ARE YOU INSECTS PLOTTING?

126
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,100
OH, NOTHING.

127
00:08:01,134 --> 00:08:03,700
- THAT STINKS, CLAUD. THAT REALLY STINKS. - JAMIE!

128
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,566
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN MONEY WAS THE REASON YOU WANTED ME TO COME.

129
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,667
TAKE STEVE.

130
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,266
STEVE IS LAZY AND UNIMAGINATIVE.

131
00:08:10,299 --> 00:08:11,733
TAKE STEVE. HE CAN BRING ALL HIS FRIENDS

132
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:13,600
SINCE YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH ALL OF THEM.

133
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:14,933
I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH ANYONE

134
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:16,967
AND I DIDN'T PICK YOU BECAUSE YOU SAVE YOUR ALLOWANCE

135
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,034
- OR BECAUSE STEVE'S A DORK. - THEN WHY DID YOU PICK ME?

136
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:22,433
NO ONE ELSE AROUND HERE THINKS I CAN DO ANYTHING.

137
00:08:22,466 --> 00:08:25,800
I PICKED YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE A QUALITY I DON'T

138
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,800
AND IT'S CRUCIAL FOR AN ADVENTURE LIKE THIS ONE.

139
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,833
OH, YEAH? WHAT?

140
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:33,867
A SENSE OF DIRECTION.

141
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,266
HUH?

142
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,266
THINK ABOUT IT. YOU ALWAYS FIND MOM'S CAR

143
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,800
WHEN SHE LOSES IT AT THE MALL.

144
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,933
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE IN THE FAMILY WHO OWNS A COMPASS.

145
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:44,333
YEAH. I GUESS SO.

146
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:47,100
COME ON, JAMIE, CAN'T YOU JUST SEE US HIDING OUT,

147
00:08:47,134 --> 00:08:48,767
SENDING MYSTERIOUS LETTERS HOME?

148
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,767
WE CAN USE CUTOUT WORDS FROM MAGAZINES

149
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,100
AND MAKE UP CODES.

150
00:08:52,134 --> 00:08:53,500
AMD WE COULD SLEEP OUTSIDE.

151
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,867
AND LEAVE PHONY TRAILS.

152
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,767
- OKAY. - WHAT?

153
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,600
WELL, I SAID OKAY,

154
00:08:59,633 --> 00:09:02,767
AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT TAKING ME FOR MY MONEY, LET'S DO IT.

155
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,600
WAY TO GO, JAMIE. ALL RIGHT.

156
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:07,233
Mother: CLAUDIA!

157
00:09:07,266 --> 00:09:08,733
DON'T FORGET THE LAUNDRY.

158
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:10,800
SURE, MOM.

159
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:15,067
JUST FOR THE RECORD, JAMIE,

160
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,299
HOW RICH ARE YOU?

161
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:24,034
ONE-- FORGET TONIGHT'S HOMEWORK.

162
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:26,933
TWO-- FIND A GOOD HIDING PLACE FOR YOUR TRUMPET.

163
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:30,266
THREE-- PACK CLEAN UNDERWEAR, SOCKS, AND A TOOTHBRUSH.

164
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:33,833
OKAY. WHEN I'M DONE WITH EVERYTHING ON THE LIST,

165
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:36,200
SHOULD I EAT IT?

166
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:38,067
Mother: COME ON! DINNER'S READY!

167
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,833
THERE'S YOUR ANSWER.

168
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:42,366
OH, THE KIDS ARE GOING TO LOVE THIS.

169
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,366
WHOA! TAKEOUT!

170
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,366
Steve: HEY, WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

171
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,233
YOUR FATHER THOUGHT YOU DESERVED A BREAK.

172
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:49,700
AND FOR DESSERT,

173
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:52,433
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE INDIVIDUAL BANANA SPLITS.

174
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,967
- Steve: WE ARE? - WITH MARSHMALLOW TOPPING?

175
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,134
WE ARE... WITH THE TOPPING OF YOUR CHOICE!

176
00:09:58,167 --> 00:10:00,733
Mother: OKAY, EVERYBODY, DIG IN!

177
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,600
DOESN'T THIS LOOK TERRIFIC, HUH?

178
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:05,400
Father: WELL, I BET IT TASTES EVEN BETTER. EH, JAMIE?

179
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:08,533
Mother: BANANA SPLITS WERE MY FAVORITE WHEN I WAS A KID.

180
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,933
Jamie: WERE THEY AS GOOD AS THESE?

181
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:11,767
Father: NOTHING COULD BE AS GOOD AS THESE.

182
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,433
HEY, CLAUDIA, ARE YOU GOING TO EAT THAT?

183
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:19,167
- I'LL EAT IT IF SHE DOESN'T WANT IT. - NO WAY. THIS IS MINE!

184
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,633
CLAUDIA, IS SOMETHING WRONG?

185
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:24,266
I DON'T USUALLY LIKE MIXING FRUIT AND DAIRY.

186
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:25,900
Mother: SINCE WHEN?

187
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:28,366
SHE'S CRAZY ABOUT CARROTS, THOUGH.

188
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,566
HEY, JAMESTER, YOU WANT AN EXTRA CHERRY OR TWO?

189
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,433
OH, YOU BET!

190
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,034
Mother: THAT'S ENOUGH. WE DON'T WANT A REPLAY

191
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,233
OF THE PINEAPPLE UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE, REMEMBER?

192
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:39,300
Steven: MOM, WE'RE EATING.

193
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,600
DON'T FORGET TO LOAD THE DISHWASHER, CLAUDIA.

194
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:43,867
I KNEW IT. I JUST KNEW YOU'D CHANGE YOUR MIND.

195
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,200
CLAUD, IF WE LEFT NOW, WE'D BE TRAITORS OR SOMETHING.

196
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:49,233
TRAITORS ARE PEOPLE WHO SACRIFICE THEIR COUNTRY

197
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:51,600
AND COUNTRYMEN FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR OWN SELFISH GAIN.

198
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:54,833
WE ARE NOT TRAITORS, JAMIE. WE WERE GOING TO RUN AWAY!

199
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:57,667
HOW COME YOU WANT TO LEAVE IF THEY'RE BEING SO NICE?

200
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,134
I MEAN, BANANA SPLITS AND TV-- WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?

201
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:03,700
I TOLD YOU, JAMIE-- I WANT TO BE APPRECIATED.

202
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:05,533
I APPRECIATE YOU, CLAUD.

203
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:07,767
I JUST DON'T WANT TO RUN AWAY.

204
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,433
( sighs )

205
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:11,266
HEY, JAMIE, COME HERE!

206
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,967
RIGHT ON THE OLD MAN.

207
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:23,200
( sighs )

208
00:11:30,366 --> 00:11:32,466
Steve: HOW COME IT HAS TO BE AUNT WEASEL?

209
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,299
- YEAH. - IT'S HAZEL, NOT WEASEL.

210
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:40,667
SO THAT'S WHY WE HAD BANANA SPLITS LAST NIGHT--

211
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,800
'CAUSE YOU'RE DUMPING US AT AUNT HAZEL'S

212
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,900
FOR THE THREE-DAY WEEKEND.

213
00:11:44,933 --> 00:11:47,233
JAMIE, WE'RE NOT DUMPING YOU ANYWHERE.

214
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:50,299
YOUR FATHER AND I WOULD LIKE TO SPEND A FEW DAYS

215
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,933
JUST WITH EACH OTHER.

216
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:54,700
WHY?

217
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,700
AUNT WEAS-- HAZEL WAS GENEROUS ENOUGH

218
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:01,266
TO INVITE YOU ALL TO HER HOME.

219
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,566
I'M SURPRISED TO HEAR YOU SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

220
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,800
YEAH, WELL, I WAS SURPRISED TO GET BANANA SPLITS.

221
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,800
WE NEVER HAD THEM BEFORE.

222
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,266
WE NEVER HAD TO STAY AT AUNT HAZEL'S, EITHER.

223
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:14,333
OH, FOR HEAVEN SAKE. YOU'RE NOT BEING SENT TO PRISON.

224
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,833
WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE, JAMIE.

225
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:19,167
YEAH, YOU BETTER GET A MOVE ON. YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS THE BUS.

226
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,233
Father: WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS LATER.

227
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:23,600
YEAH, DAD. LATER.

228
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:25,600
THOSE BANANA SPLITS WERE A SET-UP,

229
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:27,433
LIKE A PREMEDICATED CRIME.

230
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:30,100
THE WORD IS PREMEDITATED. AND I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.

231
00:12:30,134 --> 00:12:32,466
LAST NIGHT'S ACTIVITIES DID NOT IN ANY WAY REPRESENT

232
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,933
GENUINE CONCERN FOR US.

233
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:36,933
SO WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE, JAMIE?

234
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:38,800
A LIFE OF SCORN AND DEGRADATION

235
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,200
OR MYSTERY AND ADVENTURE?

236
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:43,266
YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES, JAMIE.

237
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:45,266
YOUR TRUMPET CASE IS STILL PACKED.

238
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,034
TO THE GREAT OUTDOORS

239
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,034
AND A LIFE OF MYSTERY AND ADVENTURE.

240
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:50,733
ALL RIGHT, JAMIE!

241
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,767
( loud whisper ) DON'T FORGET YOUR MONEY!

242
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,300
WHAT?

243
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,833
DON'T FORGET YOUR MONEY!

244
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:01,400
WHAT-WHAT- WHAT MONEY?

245
00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:04,400
- HUH? - JUST KIDDING.

246
00:13:09,366 --> 00:13:12,233
Driver: STEP RIGHT UP.

247
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:13,533
- MORNING, CLAUD. - HERBERT.

248
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:16,200
- JAMIE. - HEY, HERB.

249
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:18,500
MUSIC LESSONS TODAY, HUH?

250
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:19,867
- YES! - HEY, BRUCE.

251
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,134
HEY, JAMIE.

252
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,134
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY-- PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT.

253
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:25,200
NEVER HELPED ME ANY.

254
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:51,633
Herb: ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY, HERE WE ARE.

255
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:53,600
HAVE A GOOD ONE.

256
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:56,300
Boy: BYE, HERBIE.

257
00:13:58,366 --> 00:14:00,867
- Girl: HAVE A NICE DAY, HERB. - BYE-BYE.

258
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:05,833
ALL RIGHT, IS THAT EVERYBODY?

259
00:15:28,566 --> 00:15:30,200
( siren wails )

260
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:06,034
- Man: GET A MOVE ON, HERB! - HOLD YOUR HORSES.

261
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:09,466
MY CLUBS ARE GETTING COLD!

262
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,134
I'M COMING.

263
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:13,667
I'M JUST CLEANING UP THE MESS.

264
00:16:31,466 --> 00:16:33,333
Herb: THE WAY YOU PLAY GOLF, BOB,

265
00:16:33,366 --> 00:16:36,400
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE GLAD TO PUT IT OFF AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.

266
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:38,000
WHAT'S THE RUSH?

267
00:16:38,034 --> 00:16:39,800
WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO TEE OFF LATE.

268
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,767
I'M AN ACTOR. I HAVE TO MAKE A STOP--

269
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,633
WE'RE NOT STOPPING ANYWHERE.

270
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,800
( no sound )

271
00:17:27,266 --> 00:17:29,233
( siren wailing )

272
00:17:29,266 --> 00:17:30,833
ISN'T THIS GREAT?

273
00:17:30,867 --> 00:17:32,667
YEAH. WHICH WAY ARE THE WOODS?

274
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,900
- CLAUDIA? - COME ON.

275
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:43,433
Jamie: DO YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE?

276
00:17:43,466 --> 00:17:45,233
NOT EXACTLY.

277
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:47,833
BUT YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING, RIGHT?

278
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:50,067
NOT FOR SURE.

279
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,533
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE HEADED SOUTH.

280
00:17:53,566 --> 00:17:55,833
IN BACK OF US IS NORTH, TO THE RIGHT IS WEST

281
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,000
AND TO THE LEFT OF US IS EAST.

282
00:17:58,034 --> 00:18:00,200
I THINK THE WOODS ARE THAT WAY.

283
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:03,366
THANK YOU, DANIEL BOONE.

284
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,134
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

285
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,433
I JUST TOLD YOU THE WOODS ARE THAT WAY.

286
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,667
( horns honking )

287
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,000
I'M GETTING A LITTLE HUNGRY, JAMIE.

288
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:29,633
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

289
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:31,667
WHAT'S WRONG?

290
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,833
UH, NOTHING. I'M JUST HUNGRY. ARE YOU HUNGRY?

291
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,266
HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN GONE, ANYHOW?

292
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:43,667
- JAMIE? - YEAH?

293
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,300
YOU KNOW HOW MOM ALWAYS HAS A CUP OF COFFEE AT NOON?

294
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,200
UH-HUH. WHY?

295
00:18:49,234 --> 00:18:51,000
( sighs )

296
00:18:51,034 --> 00:18:54,600
I LEFT THE NOTE INSIDE HER COFFEE FILTERS.

297
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,034
IT'S 12:05.

298
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,533
"AND DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES CALL THE F.B.I. OR S.W.A.T. TEAMS

299
00:19:03,566 --> 00:19:05,266
OR ANY SUCH THING.

300
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,633
WE'RE FINE. WE'RE UNDER OUR OWN STEAM

301
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:10,366
AND WE'LL COME HOME WHEN WE'RE GOOD AND READY."

302
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,600
IT'S TYPED, BUT SHE HANDWROTE HER NAME AND JAMIE'S...

303
00:19:13,633 --> 00:19:16,000
WITHOUT THE WORD "LOVE."

304
00:19:16,034 --> 00:19:18,967
YES, I'VE CALLED THEM. THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY.

305
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I KNOW THAT.

306
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,333
IS THAT DAD? I NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

307
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:25,500
WELL, JUST GET HERE AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

308
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:27,300
WHAT'S GOING ON?

309
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,933
YOUR FATHER AND THE POLICE WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

310
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:31,200
WHAT?

311
00:19:31,234 --> 00:19:33,667
CLAUDIA AND JAMIE HAVE RUN AWAY.

312
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,566
OH, COOL.

313
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:41,700
Jamie: ALL I'M SAYING IS NEXT TIME, DON'T GET A CHEESEBURGER.

314
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:43,633
I DON'T LIKE PLAIN HAMBURGERS.

315
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:45,533
THEN GET SOMETHING ELSE.

316
00:19:45,566 --> 00:19:49,034
IF YOU KEEP BUYING SPECIALTY ITEMS, WE'RE GONNA BE BROKE.

317
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,667
YOU KNOW, IT'S GONNA BE COLD IN THE WOODS.

318
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,299
WHY DIDN'T WE PACK SLEEPING BAGS?

319
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,234
'CAUSE YOU KNOW, BURYING OURSELVES UNDER LEAVES AND MULCH,

320
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:01,366
OR WHATEVER THE NATIVE AMERICANS USED,

321
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,366
IS NOT GONNA KEEP US VERY WARM.

322
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,167
MOST NATIVE AMERICANS SLEPT UNDER HIDES, JAMIE,

323
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,100
OFTEN INSIDE TENTS.

324
00:20:08,134 --> 00:20:10,234
WE, HOWEVER, ARE NOT NATIVE AMERICANS

325
00:20:10,266 --> 00:20:13,700
NOR ARE WE SLEEPING IN THE WOODS.

326
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:17,633
WE WILL BE SLEEPING IN THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM.

327
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,234
BALONEY, WE WILL.

328
00:20:21,266 --> 00:20:25,466
YOU SAID WE WERE GOING TO HAVE AN ADVENTURE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

329
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,533
WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN

330
00:20:27,566 --> 00:20:29,900
WHERE MAYBE I CAN BE A HERO OR SOMETHING AND RESCUE A STRANDED HIKER.

331
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:32,167
YOU SAID WE WERE GONNA LIVE OFF OF SPRING WATER,

332
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,167
WILD BERRIES, AND BEAR MEAT!

333
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,533
I NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT BEAR MEAT, JAMIE.

334
00:20:36,566 --> 00:20:38,300
YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT

335
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,633
SLEEPING IN SOME DUSTY MUSEUM EITHER.

336
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:44,034
I'M NOT SLEEPING HERE, CLAUD! NO WAY!

337
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:46,733
FINE. GO WHERE YOU WANT--

338
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:49,134
THE WOODS, BACK TO THE PLACE WE USED TO CALL HOME.

339
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:51,200
FOR THAT MATTER, YOU CAN GO LIVE WITH BRUCE

340
00:20:51,234 --> 00:20:53,466
AND LOSE WHAT LITTLE I.Q. YOU'VE AMASSED THUS FAR.

341
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,300
I MADE A DECISION AND I'M GONNA STICK TO IT.

342
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:08,767
WELL, I GUESS I'LL BE SEEING YOU THEN.

343
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,067
I GUESS.

344
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,200
GOING SOMEWHERE?

345
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,433
I NEEDED TO CHECK YOUR COMPASS.

346
00:21:44,466 --> 00:21:48,200
WELL, WHERE MY COMPASS GOES, I GO.

347
00:21:48,234 --> 00:21:49,800
( sighs )

348
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,266
LOOK, JAMIE, I KNOW IT'S NOT THE WOODS,

349
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:54,067
BUT IF YOU JUST THINK OF A MUSEUM

350
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,700
AS A PLACE WITH SOUVENIRS

351
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:57,466
FROM EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD,

352
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,967
I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE AN ADVENTURE.

353
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,800
I PROMISE WE WILL.

354
00:22:11,533 --> 00:22:14,600
YOU CAN'T EVER TELL ANYBODY I DID THIS.

355
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:29,167
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO BE HERE?

356
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW EVERY DAY--

357
00:22:31,234 --> 00:22:33,234
IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF LIFE, JAMIE.

358
00:22:33,266 --> 00:22:37,299
BESIDES, WE'LL BE SURROUNDED BY BEAUTIFUL THINGS.

359
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,600
MOM'S GOT THAT QUILT HANGING UP ON THE WALL.

360
00:22:39,633 --> 00:22:41,900
DON'T YOU LIKE THAT?

361
00:22:41,933 --> 00:22:44,500
TWO, PLEASE. WE'RE MEETING OUR MOTHER INSIDE.

362
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:46,800
- WHAT? - THE MONEY, JAMIE.

363
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,466
THERE'S AN ADMISSION FEE.

364
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,067
I'M NOT PAYING A DIME--

365
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,600
JAMIE...

366
00:22:51,633 --> 00:22:53,100
MONEY.

367
00:22:53,134 --> 00:22:55,034
PEOPLE ARE WAITING.

368
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:56,967
TRUMPET CASE.

369
00:22:58,466 --> 00:23:00,300
BOOK BAG. COME ON!

370
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:03,833
COAT.

371
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,667
WELL, WHAT DID YOU GIVE THEM OUR STUFF FOR?

372
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,667
DAD'S POCKETKNIFE IS IN THERE.

373
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,900
THE ONE WITH THE SCISSORS AND NAIL CLIPPERS?

374
00:23:15,933 --> 00:23:17,600
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA NEED IT.

375
00:23:17,633 --> 00:23:19,700
FOR A MANICURE IN THE WOODS?

376
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:22,299
MY P.J.s WERE IN THERE TOO, YOU KNOW?

377
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,466
RELAX. WE'LL GET THEM LATER.

378
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,034
PEOPLE DON'T CARRY STUFF AROUND MUSEUMS.

379
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:28,433
IT'S NOT ALLOWED.

380
00:23:28,466 --> 00:23:30,600
WONDER WHERE THE RESTROOMS ARE.

381
00:23:30,633 --> 00:23:32,600
I DON'T HAVE TO GO.

382
00:23:32,633 --> 00:23:34,600
NEITHER DO I.

383
00:23:34,633 --> 00:23:36,566
HERE. TAKE THESE.

384
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,566
OH, HERE THEY ARE.

385
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,500
THIS IS WHERE I'LL HIDE AND...

386
00:23:40,533 --> 00:23:42,034
THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL HIDE

387
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:44,200
WHEN THEY CLOSE AND OPEN THE MUSEUM.

388
00:23:44,234 --> 00:23:46,900
YOU'LL GO IN A STALL AND STAND ON IT.

389
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:48,366
STAND ON WHAT?

390
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,767
YOU STAND ON THE TOILET, PUT YOUR HEAD DOWN,

391
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,967
KEEP THE STALL DOOR SLIGHTLY OPEN.

392
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,333
WHEN THE GUARDS CHECK THE BATHROOM, THEY LOOK UNDER THE DOORS FOR FEET.

393
00:23:57,366 --> 00:23:59,900
WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

394
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:01,833
SAW IT IN THE MOVIES.

395
00:24:01,867 --> 00:24:03,967
WE'LL STAY HIDDEN FOR 15 MINUTES.

396
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,667
BY THEN THE GUARDS SHOULD BE GONE.

397
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,733
WE'LL COME OUT-- SIMPLE.

398
00:24:07,767 --> 00:24:09,900
ACT NATURAL. HERE'S A GUARD COMING NOW.

399
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:14,466
LOST?

400
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,700
WELL, ACTUALLY--

401
00:24:17,733 --> 00:24:19,500
ARRANGE TO MEET YOUR PARENTS

402
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:21,067
AND NOW YOU CAN'T LOCATE THEM?

403
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,167
THEY WON'T BE HAPPY WHEN THEY FIND YOU, YOU KNOW.

404
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,234
THEY'LL ACT HAPPY BUT I GUARANTEE YOU'LL BE PUNISHED.

405
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,800
WE'RE HERE WITH OUR COUSINS,

406
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,800
AND THEY'RE USING THE LAVATORIES,

407
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:34,167
AND WE WERE JUST, UM,

408
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,266
FAMILIARIZING OURSELVES WITH WHAT EXHIBIT'S WHERE

409
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:39,234
SO WE COULD MAXIMIZE OUR EXPERIENCE FOR OUR LIMITED TIME.

410
00:24:39,266 --> 00:24:40,933
SHE'S A TIME-SAVER.

411
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:44,067
THE TRUTH IS, WE HAVE TO BE GOING.

412
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,800
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, THE MUSEUM WILL BE CLOSED

413
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,466
AND THEN WE'D BE LOCKED IN AND WE CAN'T HAVE THAT

414
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,100
WE HAVE TO GO HOME AND COOK FOR OUR FAMILY OF EIGHT.

415
00:24:49,134 --> 00:24:50,867
BYE!

416
00:24:52,633 --> 00:24:54,400
Claudia: THIS IS FABULOUS, ISN'T IT?

417
00:24:54,433 --> 00:24:56,833
DIDN'T I TELL YOU THIS PLACE WAS GREAT?

418
00:24:56,867 --> 00:24:59,266
JUST A LOT OF OLD PAINTINGS AND STUFF.

419
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:02,366
JAMIE, THIS ISN'T STUFF. THIS IS ART.

420
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,500
ALL RIGHT, WHERE ARE WE GOING?

421
00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:06,333
ONCE WE FIND A PLACE TO SLEEP,

422
00:25:06,366 --> 00:25:08,400
WE'LL SCATTER OUR STUFF IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS.

423
00:25:08,433 --> 00:25:10,400
THAT WAY IF THE MUSEUM GUARDS FIND ONE THING,

424
00:25:10,433 --> 00:25:12,167
THEY WON'T FIND THEM ALL.

425
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,800
THEY GOT BEDS IN AN ART MUSEUM?

426
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:16,466
BEDS ARE FURNITURE, JAMIE, AND FURNITURE'S ART.

427
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,667
WHY DIDN'T I KNOW THAT?

428
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,034
JAMIE?

429
00:25:23,234 --> 00:25:25,333
JAMIE!

430
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,333
NOW THESE GUYS GOT THE RIGHT IDEA.

431
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,333
THIS IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING.

432
00:25:35,366 --> 00:25:38,333
PLEASE, JAMIE. WILL YOU FORGET ABOUT THE WOODS?

433
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,067
YOU KNOW, IF THAT ADMISSION FEE THING STARTS CUTTING INTO OUR FUNDS,

434
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,234
I KNOW A WAY WE CAN GET MORE MONEY.

435
00:25:46,266 --> 00:25:47,466
- OH, YES? - YEAH!

436
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,833
I COULD PLAY CARDS WITH THAT GUARD WE MET-- MORRIS.

437
00:25:50,867 --> 00:25:52,833
I BET I COULD WIN A WHOLE LOT OFF OF HIM.

438
00:25:52,867 --> 00:25:55,733
JAMIE, IF YOU PLAY CARDS WITH THE GUARD,

439
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:57,400
HE'LL REMEMBER YOU.

440
00:25:57,433 --> 00:25:59,134
IF THE AUTHORITIES COME LOOKING FOR US,

441
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:00,700
HE'D DESCRIBE YOU TO A TEE.

442
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:02,867
THEY'D GET FINGERPRINTS FROM THE MONEY HE WON FROM YOU

443
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,867
AND THEN WE'D BE IN HANDCUFFS BEFORE YOU COULD COUNT TO THREE.

444
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,000
NOW JUST LOOK AT THIS PAINTING, JAMIE.

445
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:11,933
ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?

446
00:26:11,967 --> 00:26:13,900
YEAH. TERRIFIC.

447
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:18,167
COME ON.

448
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:28,167
THIS IS PERFECT, ISN'T IT?

449
00:26:31,234 --> 00:26:33,800
THIS IS WHERE WE'LL SLEEP.

450
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:37,266
BUT IT SAYS NOT TO STAND ON THE PLATFORM.

451
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:39,333
DOES IT SAY NOT TO RUN AWAY FROM HOME

452
00:26:39,366 --> 00:26:40,967
AND SLEEP IN MUSEUMS?

453
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,200
AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT SAYS TO SLEEP IN THE WOODS.

454
00:26:45,733 --> 00:26:48,867
JAMES LINCOLN KINCAID, GET OFF THAT BED!

455
00:26:54,266 --> 00:26:56,500
THEY'RE GOING TO BE CLOSING SOON.

456
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:58,333
LET'S GO.

457
00:28:00,767 --> 00:28:02,633
( door opens )

458
00:28:03,733 --> 00:28:05,234
( door closes )

459
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,767
( door opens )

460
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,800
( whispering ) BREATHE, CLAUDIA.

461
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:32,299
( door closes )

462
00:28:59,266 --> 00:29:00,967
( door locking )

463
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,466
JAMIE?

464
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,933
JAMIE?

465
00:29:46,067 --> 00:29:47,933
I'M HUNGRY.

466
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,867
PRICE OF ADVENTURE.

467
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,967
LET'S GET OUR THINGS.

468
00:30:13,067 --> 00:30:15,433
NO EATING IN BED.

469
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:44,333
CLAUDIA.

470
00:30:45,466 --> 00:30:46,833
BOO!

471
00:30:46,867 --> 00:30:48,867
GIVE ME THAT.

472
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,299
DIDN'T PUT A FLASHLIGHT ON THE LIST.

473
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:53,833
- I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO BE IN THE WOODS-- - "IN THE WOODS."

474
00:30:57,667 --> 00:30:59,366
"STATE BED.

475
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,200
SCENE OF THE ALLEGED MURDER OF AMY ROBSART,

476
00:31:03,234 --> 00:31:06,566
FIRST WIFE OF LORD ROBERT DUDLEY."

477
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,000
HEY!

478
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:10,667
A GIRL GOT KILLED IN THAT BED.

479
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,633
( sighs )

480
00:31:17,466 --> 00:31:20,234
THAT'S A PORTRAIT OF LADY SCOFIELD.

481
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:23,299
SHE WAS MARRIED TO A KING WHO CUT HER HEAD OFF.

482
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:26,167
THEY SAY SHE WANDERED AROUND THE CASTLE

483
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,200
WITH HER HEAD UNDER HER ARM.

484
00:31:28,234 --> 00:31:29,333
COOL.

485
00:31:29,366 --> 00:31:33,299
UH, I DIDN'T BRUSH MY TEETH.

486
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:35,433
YOU WILL TOMORROW.

487
00:31:35,466 --> 00:31:37,266
WE'D BETTER GET SOME SLEEP

488
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:39,134
IF WE'RE GOING TO WAKE UP

489
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:41,000
BEFORE THE GUARDS COME BACK.

490
00:31:43,466 --> 00:31:46,867
YOU KNOW WHAT? WE HAVE TO FIND A REAL RESTAURANT TOMORROW, TOO.

491
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,900
I FIGURE IF WE ORDER ONE HUMONGO MEAL AND SHARE IT,

492
00:31:50,933 --> 00:31:53,333
WE'LL SAVE MONEY THAT WAY.

493
00:31:57,067 --> 00:31:59,200
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I THINK?

494
00:31:59,234 --> 00:32:02,200
THEY COULD NEVER GET MY FINGERPRINTS FROM MY MONEY.

495
00:32:02,234 --> 00:32:03,667
WHAT?

496
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,700
YOU SAID THE AUTHORITIES WOULD GET MY FINGERPRINTS FROM THE MONEY

497
00:32:06,733 --> 00:32:08,700
THAT GUARD WOULD WIN FROM ME,

498
00:32:08,733 --> 00:32:12,533
BUT THEY NEVER WOULD BECAUSE HE'D NEVER WIN.

499
00:32:12,566 --> 00:32:14,633
WHY NOT?

500
00:32:16,466 --> 00:32:18,566
BECAUSE I CHEAT.

501
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,266
YOU WHAT?

502
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:22,833
THAT'S HOW COME I'M SO RICH.

503
00:32:22,867 --> 00:32:25,700
YOU CHEAT WHEN YOU PLAY CARDS WITH BRUCE?

504
00:32:25,733 --> 00:32:27,366
YEAH.

505
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,800
BRUCE IS YOUR BEST FRIEND.

506
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:31,533
I KNOW.

507
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,266
IT'S KIND OF CREEPY IN HERE,

508
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:42,500
DON'T YOU THINK?

509
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:49,067
JAMIE,

510
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:53,533
I KNOW A LOT OF THINGS ARE SCARY IN HERE,

511
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:56,533
BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER

512
00:32:56,566 --> 00:33:01,234
THAT IT'S ALL JUST MANUFACTURED

513
00:33:01,266 --> 00:33:03,867
AND THAT NOTHING IN HERE IS ALIVE

514
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:07,967
OR CAN HURT YOU OR AFFECT YOU IN ANY WAY.

515
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,100
AND IF YOU REALLY CAN'T SLEEP,

516
00:33:10,134 --> 00:33:12,100
WE CAN SIT UP AND TALK FOR A WHILE

517
00:33:12,134 --> 00:33:14,800
UNTIL YOU FEEL RELAXED, OKAY?

518
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:19,767
JAMIE?

519
00:33:51,366 --> 00:33:53,333
'NIGHT, JAMIE.

520
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,100
( gasps )

521
00:34:40,767 --> 00:34:42,400
JAMIE!

522
00:34:42,433 --> 00:34:44,034
JAMIE, WAKE UP. IT'S 9:00.

523
00:34:44,067 --> 00:34:45,967
MY ALARM DIDN'T GO OFF.

524
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,700
WHERE ARE WE?

525
00:34:47,733 --> 00:34:49,733
IN A BED WHERE A MURDER TOOK PLACE

526
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:53,833
AND ANOTHER ONE'S GOING TO IF YOU DON'T GET UP AND PUT YOUR CLOTHES ON.

527
00:34:53,867 --> 00:34:55,533
( footsteps approach )

528
00:34:59,234 --> 00:35:01,566
QUICK, JAMIE, GET UNDER THE COVERS!

529
00:35:12,466 --> 00:35:14,299
- Man: HEY, JERRY! - WHAT?

530
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:16,833
COME AND CHECK THE BOTTICELLI!

531
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:18,566
WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?

532
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,100
I THINK IT'S COMING OFF THE WALL.

533
00:35:20,134 --> 00:35:22,134
YEAH, LIKE THE RUBENS LAST WEEK.

534
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:25,600
JAMIE, WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE!

535
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,700
SO WHO WON THE GAME LAST NIGHT?

536
00:35:54,733 --> 00:35:57,533
Man: WE DID, MAN. IT WAS GREAT.

537
00:36:37,433 --> 00:36:39,134
OVER HERE.

538
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,667
Man: AHEM.

539
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,667
THE MUSEUM OPENS AT 10:00,

540
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,067
SO HIDE UNTIL 10:15.

541
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,134
THAT'S WHEN REGULAR PEOPLE LIKE US WILL BE ALL OVER.

542
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:21,034
THAT'S WHEN TO COME OUT AND MEET ME ON THE FRONT STEPS.

543
00:37:21,067 --> 00:37:22,333
HERE.

544
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:24,667
I DON'T WANT TO BRUSH MY TEETH. I WANT TO EAT.

545
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,200
EAT SOME TOOTHPASTE FIRST.

546
00:37:26,234 --> 00:37:28,500
AS SOON AS THE MUSEUM OPENS, WE'LL GET SOME FOOD,

547
00:37:28,533 --> 00:37:30,234
ALL RIGHT?

548
00:37:49,933 --> 00:37:51,366
( thudding )

549
00:37:58,767 --> 00:38:00,500
WHERE DID YOU COME FROM?

550
00:38:00,533 --> 00:38:03,333
UH, MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID HEAVEN,

551
00:38:03,366 --> 00:38:07,500
BUT THEN YOU HEAR ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT CABBAGES AND THE STORK.

552
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,267
OH, NO! IT'S MORRIS.

553
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,333
THIS A SCHOOL HOLIDAY?

554
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:26,667
NO, SIR. BUT I LEFT MY VIOLIN CASE IN THERE.

555
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,566
AND IT'S MY MUSIC DAY TODAY

556
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,633
AND MY MOM'S WAITING IN THE CAR OUT THERE.

557
00:38:30,667 --> 00:38:32,200
WHERE IS IT?

558
00:38:32,234 --> 00:38:34,933
- WHERE'S WHAT? - YOUR VIOLIN CASE.

559
00:38:34,967 --> 00:38:37,234
SEE, WE THOUGHT SHE LEFT IT INSIDE,

560
00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:39,900
BUT IT TURNS OUT IT'S AT HOME.

561
00:38:39,933 --> 00:38:42,400
AND MOM'S GONNA HAVE A COW. SO SEE YA.

562
00:38:42,433 --> 00:38:44,200
WHAT'S YOUR NAMES?

563
00:38:44,234 --> 00:38:45,633
UH, HIS NAME'S RALPH.

564
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:47,967
AND HER NAME'S EMILY! BYE!

565
00:38:51,034 --> 00:38:52,900
THERE YOU GO.

566
00:38:58,299 --> 00:39:00,767
WE GOT TO BUY SOME MORE FOOD FOR TONIGHT.

567
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,900
AFTER ALL OF THAT, YOU'RE GOING TO BE HUNGRY?

568
00:39:03,933 --> 00:39:05,967
Man: PICK UP 17.

569
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,167
SOME COOKIES AND MORE CHIPS.

570
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,466
YEAH.

571
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,833
AND SOME FRUIT.

572
00:39:10,867 --> 00:39:13,466
MMM. CAKE. YEAH. DEFINITELY CAKE.

573
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,333
FRUIT!

574
00:39:15,366 --> 00:39:17,733
RODENTS EAT FRUIT, YOU KNOW.

575
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:19,366
THANK YOU.

576
00:39:29,733 --> 00:39:30,967
JAMIE.

577
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,700
WHAT?

578
00:39:40,067 --> 00:39:42,234
LET'S GO.

579
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,300
LEAVE IT, JAMIE.

580
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,466
I SAID LEAVE IT.

581
00:39:56,767 --> 00:39:59,333
IF WE WERE IN THE WOODS, NO ONE WOULD SEE US AT ALL.

582
00:39:59,366 --> 00:40:01,533
WRONG, EINSTEIN. IF WE WERE IN THE WOODS,

583
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,267
WE'D BE FROZEN SOLID.

584
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,333
AND IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE'D BE COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY DEAD.

585
00:40:06,366 --> 00:40:09,067
NOW COME ON.

586
00:40:13,433 --> 00:40:18,267
GREAT. NOW IT'S GONNA TAKE US HOURS TO GET BACK IN.

587
00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:20,034
BALONEY.

588
00:40:20,067 --> 00:40:21,733
WE'RE NOT GOING TO WAIT

589
00:40:21,767 --> 00:40:24,733
AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO PAY. COME ON.

590
00:40:30,267 --> 00:40:32,667
EXCUSE ME.

591
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:36,466
I'M ON A FIELD TRIP WITH A BUNCH OF STUDENTS WAY BACK THERE.

592
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,500
WE'RE HERE TO APPRECIATE FINE ART,

593
00:40:39,533 --> 00:40:42,500
BUT ON ACCOUNT OF MY LEG BEING BROKE IN 10 PLACES,

594
00:40:42,533 --> 00:40:45,034
MY TEACHER, MRS. HINEBURGER, WANTED TO KNOW

595
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,433
IF IT WAS OKAY BY YOU IF I WENT IN AND SAT DOWN

596
00:40:47,466 --> 00:40:49,767
'CAUSE I CAN'T STAND FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME.

597
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:54,000
AND, UH, THIS IS EVELYN, OUR STUDENT AIDE.

598
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:57,533
SHE CAME WITH ME BECAUSE I MIGHT BE A LITTLE IRRESPONSIBLE.

599
00:40:59,633 --> 00:41:01,833
YOUR LEG WAS BROKE IN 10 PLACES?

600
00:41:01,867 --> 00:41:04,234
IT WAS AN AWESOME BIKE ACCIDENT.

601
00:41:04,267 --> 00:41:06,667
HEY, I STILL HAVE THE PIN. WANT TO SEE?

602
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,100
NO, THAT'S FINE. YOU CAN GO IN.

603
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:11,100
IF THERE'S ANY PROBLEM AT THE DOOR,

604
00:41:11,134 --> 00:41:13,100
JUST TELL THEM CORA SAID IT'S OKAY.

605
00:41:13,134 --> 00:41:14,333
THANKS.

606
00:41:19,967 --> 00:41:22,667
HEY, DO YOU THINK SOMEBODY DIED?

607
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,366
MAYBE THEY'RE INTERVIEWING A GREAT ARTIST.

608
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,900
MAYBE A GREAT ARTIST DIED.

609
00:41:26,933 --> 00:41:28,234
Man: EXCUSE US, PLEASE.

610
00:41:28,267 --> 00:41:31,466
EXCUSE US. THANK YOU.

611
00:41:41,267 --> 00:41:43,800
SORRY. BUT...

612
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:46,300
( sniffs ) EW. FRUITY.

613
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:49,466
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN YUCKY ON YOUR SHOE.

614
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,299
YES, I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN.

615
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:54,034
SOMEBODY HERE HAS VERY BAD MANNERS.

616
00:41:56,167 --> 00:41:58,433
DO I MAKE YOU NERVOUS?

617
00:41:58,466 --> 00:42:00,667
NO, MA'AM. I HAVE A SISTER.

618
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,800
I'M USED TO WEIRD STUFF.

619
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:05,867
I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT SO BAD.

620
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,700
WELL, THANKS.

621
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:10,967
PARKS.

622
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,867
ARE YOU HERE TO SEE THE SCULPTURE?

623
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,867
UH, I GUESS SO.

624
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,034
WELL, I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

625
00:42:19,067 --> 00:42:21,533
I THINK YOU WILL.

626
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,299
WHAT SCULPTURE?

627
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:29,867
I DON'T KNOW.

628
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,167
LET'S FIND OUT.

629
00:42:37,267 --> 00:42:39,067
THE EXPERTS CAN'T AGREE.

630
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,500
IT'S EITHER AN EARTH-SHATTERING DISCOVERY

631
00:42:41,533 --> 00:42:43,466
OR AN ABSOLUTE PHONY.

632
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:47,466
WELL, IF IT IS BY MICHELANGELO, IT WOULD BE WORTH MILLIONS.

633
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,566
HEY, WHO'S MIKE D. ANGELO?

634
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,566
MICHELANGELO. DON'T YOU KNOW ANYTHING?

635
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:59,633
IT SAYS HERE THAT NO ONE KNOWS FOR SURE WHO MADE THIS STATUE.

636
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:02,400
IT'S A REAL MYSTERY.

637
00:43:06,867 --> 00:43:08,267
THE MYSTERY IS

638
00:43:08,299 --> 00:43:10,466
WHY WE'RE STANDING IN THIS LINE.

639
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,933
SHH.

640
00:43:37,134 --> 00:43:39,900
Woman: PLEASE KEEP MOVING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

641
00:44:15,234 --> 00:44:18,067
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WOULD BE SO BEAUTIFUL.

642
00:44:20,967 --> 00:44:22,733
IT'S MORRIS! DUCK!

643
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:33,533
WHEW.

644
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,433
JAMIE... LOOK.

645
00:44:45,034 --> 00:44:47,267
Woman: PLEASE MOVE THROUGH.

646
00:44:47,299 --> 00:44:49,667
( whispering ) WE CAN COME BACK LATER.

647
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,967
WE HAVE TO BE MORE CAREFUL NOW

648
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,667
ABOUT THE GUARDS AND TALKING TO STRANGERS.

649
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,167
NOW THAT WE HAVE A JOB TO DO,

650
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,034
WE MIGHT BE HERE LONGER THAN I PLANNED.

651
00:45:07,067 --> 00:45:09,900
WHAT JOB DO WE HAVE TO DO?

652
00:45:09,933 --> 00:45:12,067
OUR JOB, LITTLE BROTHER,

653
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,500
IS TO PERFORM A SERVICE FOR MANKIND,

654
00:45:14,533 --> 00:45:17,900
TO REVEAL THE ABSOLUTE AND IRREFUTABLE TRUTH.

655
00:45:17,933 --> 00:45:20,933
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT TRUTH IS, JAMIE?

656
00:45:20,967 --> 00:45:23,100
THAT YOU HAVE A WEIRD PERSONALITY?

657
00:45:23,134 --> 00:45:26,700
THE TRUTH IS, THAT SCULPTURE,

658
00:45:26,733 --> 00:45:29,466
THAT PERFECT MASS OF HANDCRAFTED STONE,

659
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:33,034
IS EITHER THE WORK OF THE GREAT ARTIST MICHELANGELO

660
00:45:33,067 --> 00:45:35,167
OR IT ISN'T.

661
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,733
THERE'S NO IN BETWEEN.

662
00:45:37,767 --> 00:45:41,234
I'M GOING TO SOLVE THAT MYSTERY, JAMIE,

663
00:45:41,267 --> 00:45:44,267
AND YOU'RE GOING TO HELP ME.

664
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,400
I FOUND IT, JAMIE.

665
00:46:11,433 --> 00:46:13,067
NO WAY!

666
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,767
WHAT WE SAW--

667
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,833
WHAT WE SAW ON THE BOTTOM OF THE STATUE

668
00:46:16,867 --> 00:46:19,034
WAS MICHELANGELO'S STONEMASON'S MARK.

669
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,933
EVERY SCULPTURE HE MADE

670
00:46:20,967 --> 00:46:22,566
HAD IT STAMPED ON IT SOMEWHERE.

671
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,167
I LOOKED THROUGH A THOUSAND BOOKS TO FIND IT.

672
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,900
SO WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME...

673
00:46:27,933 --> 00:46:30,600
IS THE ANGEL IS WORTH MILLIONS?

674
00:46:30,633 --> 00:46:33,633
NO, JAMIE. THIS ISN'T ABOUT MONEY. THIS IS ABOUT ART.

675
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:37,034
AND ART IS THE MAGIC THAT COMES FROM GREATNESS.

676
00:46:37,067 --> 00:46:39,633
SO IF MICHELANGELO REALLY DID CARVE THE ANGEL,

677
00:46:39,667 --> 00:46:42,533
THEN THAT ANGEL'S MAGIC TOO.

678
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,400
Claudia: THAT'S RIGHT, MR. JORDAN.

679
00:46:47,433 --> 00:46:50,500
I'M SURE THIS IS A FINDING OF REAL SIGNIFICANCE--

680
00:46:50,533 --> 00:46:52,067
A REAL BREAKTHROUGH--

681
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,299
AND I'D LIKE TO MEET AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

682
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:56,533
TO DISCUSS THE MATTER.

683
00:46:56,566 --> 00:47:00,466
TOMORROW AT 4:00?

684
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:05,000
YES. I THINK I CAN BE AVAILABLE THEN.

685
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,366
YES. AND THANK YOU.

686
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:14,267
THIS IS HISTORY IN THE MAKING, JAMIE.

687
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:16,000
TOMORROW, I SHALL MEET

688
00:47:16,034 --> 00:47:18,833
WITH THE CURATOR OF THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM

689
00:47:18,867 --> 00:47:23,100
TO DISCUSS THE LEGITIMACY OF MY FINDINGS.

690
00:47:23,134 --> 00:47:27,633
JAME, THIS IS TRULY FANTASTIC.

691
00:47:29,466 --> 00:47:31,800
Claudia: I BET IF MICHELANGELO DID MAKE THAT ANGEL,

692
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:33,900
HE CARVED IT FOR SOMEONE SPECIAL,

693
00:47:33,933 --> 00:47:36,900
PROBABLY A ROYAL PRINCE OR SOMETHING,

694
00:47:36,933 --> 00:47:38,667
FOR A WEDDING PRESENT.

695
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,967
YEAH, WELL, I BET HE MADE HER FOR AN ANGEL STORE.

696
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,800
THEY PROBABLY HAD 'EM IN THOSE DAYS.

697
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:45,000
I DON'T THINK SO, JAMIE.

698
00:47:45,034 --> 00:47:47,967
YOU WANT ME TO TAKE A BATH IN THIS?

699
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,633
ABSOLUTELY.

700
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:51,433
HEY.

701
00:47:51,466 --> 00:47:53,867
WHAT'S THIS?

702
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:56,400
WE'RE RICH, CLAUD!

703
00:47:56,433 --> 00:47:59,100
THIS FOUNTAIN IS FILLED WITH MONEY!

704
00:47:59,134 --> 00:48:01,333
THAT MONEY'S NOT OURS ANY MORE

705
00:48:01,366 --> 00:48:04,200
THAN THE MONEY YOU CHEAT FROM BRUCE IS YOURS, JAMIE.

706
00:48:04,234 --> 00:48:06,566
I GUESS NOT.

707
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,400
( water splashes )

708
00:48:08,433 --> 00:48:11,733
WHY DO PEOPLE THROW MONEY INTO FOUNTAINS ANYWAY?

709
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:13,633
TO MAKE A WISH.

710
00:48:13,667 --> 00:48:16,433
YEAH, WELL, I WISH WE DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE A BATH IN THAT FOUNTAIN.

711
00:48:16,466 --> 00:48:18,067
AND I WISH YOU'D JUST GET IN.

712
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,167
WE HAVE TO LOOK OUR BEST FOR TOMORROW'S MEETING, JAMIE.

713
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,299
BALONEY. YOU HAVE TO LOOK YOUR BEST.

714
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:24,800
I'M GONNA BE DOWN THE STREET AT THE ARCADE.

715
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:27,500
BALONEY. YOU'RE GONNA BE MY LOOKOUT, JAMIE.

716
00:48:27,533 --> 00:48:30,100
COME ON. HERE'S SOME SOAP FROM HOME.

717
00:48:30,134 --> 00:48:31,466
LET'S GET IN.

718
00:48:33,067 --> 00:48:35,667
HERE. I COULD FREEZE IN THERE, YOU KNOW.

719
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,167
THEN WE'LL BOTH FREEZE. COME ON.

720
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,366
( sighs )

721
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,400
SEE? IT'S NOT SO BAD.

722
00:48:43,433 --> 00:48:45,400
HOW MANY PEOPLE GET TO BATHE

723
00:48:45,433 --> 00:48:48,034
IN A REAL LIVE FOUNTAIN?

724
00:48:48,067 --> 00:48:51,134
YOU REALIZE THIS IS A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE, DON'T YOU?

725
00:48:51,167 --> 00:48:54,167
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

726
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,433
YOU KNOW WHAT I REALLY WISH?

727
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:58,267
THAT WE COULD KEEP ALL THIS MONEY?

728
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,267
JUST WASH, JAMIE.

729
00:49:00,299 --> 00:49:02,067
- YOU WASH. - JAMIE!

730
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,933
- STOP THAT! - YOU STOP THAT!

731
00:49:05,967 --> 00:49:07,867
NO!

732
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,733
STOP THAT!

733
00:50:01,967 --> 00:50:04,500
DID PAPA KINCAID EVER TELL YOU

734
00:50:04,533 --> 00:50:06,533
YOU HAD A GOOD LUCK CHARM?

735
00:50:06,566 --> 00:50:08,900
UH-HUH.

736
00:50:08,933 --> 00:50:10,867
WHY?

737
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:15,600
WELL, HE SAID MINE WAS AN ANGEL.

738
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:09,000
CLAUD? YOU IN THERE?

739
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,733
CLAUDIA?

740
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,034
CLAUDIA?

741
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,167
( door closes )

742
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,867
( TV playing softly )

743
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,633
CLAUD?

744
00:53:37,667 --> 00:53:39,034
IS THAT YOU?

745
00:53:39,067 --> 00:53:41,700
Man: HEY, THIS IS ABOUT THE MUSEUM.

746
00:53:41,733 --> 00:53:43,733
TURN IT UP, WILL YOU?

747
00:53:43,767 --> 00:53:46,167
Female anchor: ...has arisen from the belief

748
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,533
that it may be the work

749
00:53:47,566 --> 00:53:51,100
of the Italian Renaissance master Michelangelo.

750
00:53:51,134 --> 00:53:52,867
The statue was auctioned anonymously,

751
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,667
but is now believed to have come from

752
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,900
the collection of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler,

753
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:59,400
who currently resides in Nielsen Heights.

754
00:53:59,433 --> 00:54:01,500
Now back to the newsroom.

755
00:54:01,533 --> 00:54:04,600
And on the local scene today, the Kincaid family,

756
00:54:04,633 --> 00:54:06,167
whose children have been missing

757
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,667
for the last three days,

758
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,466
held a press conference today

759
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,267
appealing for their safe return.

760
00:54:12,299 --> 00:54:14,700
We'd just like to say that...

761
00:54:14,733 --> 00:54:17,667
if someone's taken our children,

762
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,933
please let them go.

763
00:54:19,967 --> 00:54:22,267
And, uh...

764
00:54:25,267 --> 00:54:27,000
Claudia and Jamie,

765
00:54:27,034 --> 00:54:30,533
if you ran away like your letter says...

766
00:54:30,566 --> 00:54:31,933
please come home.

767
00:54:31,967 --> 00:54:35,633
We're having a very hard time without you.

768
00:54:39,433 --> 00:54:41,500
HOPE THOSE KIDS ARE OKAY, HUH?

769
00:54:54,867 --> 00:54:57,933
Woman: CHILDREN, CHILDREN, IT'S TIME TO LEAVE...

770
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:05,366
- WHOA! - WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

771
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,566
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU FOR AN HOUR.

772
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,167
YOU WEREN'T WHERE YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE.

773
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,167
AND YOUR VIOLIN CASE IS GONE.

774
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,633
AND ANYWAY, HOW COME YOU'RE WEARING ALL THIS STUFF?

775
00:55:15,667 --> 00:55:18,333
IT DOESN'T BELONG TO YOU.

776
00:55:18,366 --> 00:55:20,167
NO, BUT YOU DO.

777
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,267
JAMIE, WE HAVE TO PREPARE FOR THE MEETING.

778
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,767
NOT ANOTHER BATH.

779
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,967
Claudia: SO I COULDN'T USE THE BATHROOM

780
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,800
BECAUSE IT HAD REPAIR PEOPLE IN IT

781
00:55:28,833 --> 00:55:30,533
AND THE ONLY OTHER ROOM THAT WASN'T LOCKED WAS LOST AND FOUND

782
00:55:30,566 --> 00:55:32,267
WHICH, BELIEVE ME, WAS SERENDIPITOUS

783
00:55:32,299 --> 00:55:34,633
BECAUSE I NEEDED SOMETHING TO WEAR FOR THE MEETING TODAY.

784
00:55:34,667 --> 00:55:36,466
THEN I WENT TO PUT MY TOOTHBRUSH AWAY.

785
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,167
THE CLEANING CREW WAS ABOUT TO COME IN SO I GRABBED MY VIOLIN CASE

786
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,833
AND THAT'S WHEN I SAW YOU... LUCKILY.

787
00:55:41,867 --> 00:55:44,600
WHAT?

788
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:48,366
I SAW MOM AND DAD ON T.V. TODAY.

789
00:56:02,433 --> 00:56:04,900
YOU WANT TO GO HOME, DON'T YOU?

790
00:56:04,933 --> 00:56:08,633
I KIND OF GOT THE SHIVERS, AND I ACHE A LITTLE TOO.

791
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:14,267
JAMIE, IF WE GO HOME BEFORE THE MYSTERY IS SOLVED,

792
00:56:14,299 --> 00:56:17,234
THEY STILL WON'T APPRECIATE ME.

793
00:56:17,267 --> 00:56:19,433
AND ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE,

794
00:56:19,466 --> 00:56:21,933
THEY'LL BE FURIOUS WITH US.

795
00:56:24,733 --> 00:56:26,600
HERE. TAKE THIS.

796
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,267
IT WILL MAKE YOU BETTER.

797
00:56:28,299 --> 00:56:29,933
I'M NOT THIRSTY.

798
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,600
FINE. I ADMIT IT.

799
00:56:35,633 --> 00:56:39,200
I'M A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT YOU BEING SICK,

800
00:56:39,234 --> 00:56:41,633
AND I KNOW YOU WANT TO GO HOME

801
00:56:41,667 --> 00:56:43,333
BUT YOU CAN'T GO HOME,

802
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:45,200
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME YET

803
00:56:45,234 --> 00:56:47,533
AND YOU CAN'T GO HOME WITHOUT ME, BECAUSE...

804
00:56:49,267 --> 00:56:53,234
PAPA KINCAID SAYS ANGELS ARE YOUR GOOD LUCK CHARM, RIGHT?

805
00:56:54,933 --> 00:56:57,833
HE SAID YOU'RE MINE.

806
00:56:57,867 --> 00:57:01,000
PAPA KINCAID SAID I'M YOUR GOOD LUCK CHARM?

807
00:57:01,034 --> 00:57:02,100
YEAH.

808
00:57:02,134 --> 00:57:04,000
THE DAY YOU WERE BORN

809
00:57:04,034 --> 00:57:06,600
AND ABOUT A MILLION TIMES AFTER THAT.

810
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:18,466
THINK STEVE HAS A GOOD LUCK CHARM?

811
00:57:19,933 --> 00:57:22,900
ASK PAPA KINCAID AT THANKSGIVING.

812
00:57:22,933 --> 00:57:25,234
WE SHOULD BE HOME BY THEN.

813
00:57:30,466 --> 00:57:32,100
Man: AS I SAID, EVELYN,

814
00:57:32,134 --> 00:57:34,267
WE ARE AWARE OF THE CLUE YOU SO CLEVERLY FOUND.

815
00:57:34,299 --> 00:57:36,967
BUT I'M AFRAID WE STILL NEED MORE INFORMATION

816
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,700
BEFORE WE CAN AUTHENTICATE THE SCULPTURE'S HISTORY.

817
00:57:39,733 --> 00:57:43,667
OH. HOW LONG DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD TAKE?

818
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:45,667
THAT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY.

819
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,733
EXPERTS IN THE FIELD HAVE LONG KNOWN

820
00:57:47,767 --> 00:57:49,633
THAT MICHELANGELO DID NOT CARVE

821
00:57:49,667 --> 00:57:52,967
ALL OF THE MARBLE BLOCKS THAT WERE QUARRIED FOR HIM AND BORE HIS MARK.

822
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,833
SOME EXPERTS EVEN BELIEVE THAT THE STONEMASON'S MARK IS COUNTERFEIT.

823
00:57:56,867 --> 00:57:58,433
THEY DO?

824
00:57:58,466 --> 00:58:01,267
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING IN, EVELYN.

825
00:58:01,299 --> 00:58:04,500
A MUSEUM CANNOT SURVIVE WITHOUT THE PUBLIC'S SUPPORT.

826
00:58:04,533 --> 00:58:06,500
YOU CAN BE PROUD OF YOURSELF.

827
00:58:06,533 --> 00:58:09,433
YOU'RE AN OUTSTANDING CITIZEN.

828
00:58:09,466 --> 00:58:11,900
IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU, MR. JORDAN.

829
00:58:11,933 --> 00:58:14,299
THE PLEASURE WAS MINE, EVELYN.

830
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,466
JAMIE?

831
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,900
JAMIE?

832
00:58:27,933 --> 00:58:29,867
OVER HERE, CLAUD.

833
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:34,234
I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD.

834
00:58:40,833 --> 00:58:43,167
WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK HERE?

835
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,967
CAN WE GO HOME NOW?

836
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,333
I FEEL AWFUL.

837
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,667
Claudia: BUT WE CAN'T GO HOME NOW, JAMIE,

838
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,400
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T ACCOMPLISHED ANYTHING.

839
00:58:57,433 --> 00:59:00,300
WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WE DID SO.

840
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:03,300
WE HAD AN ADVENTURE LIKE YOU SAID WE WOULD,

841
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:05,200
AND WE SOLVED THE MYSTERY

842
00:59:05,234 --> 00:59:07,234
AS GOOD AS ANY OF THE EXPERTS HAVE.

843
00:59:07,267 --> 00:59:10,433
BESIDES, WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR ALMOST THREE DAYS STRAIGHT

844
00:59:10,466 --> 00:59:12,733
AND WE HAVEN'T KILLED EACH OTHER YET.

845
00:59:13,933 --> 00:59:16,800
I DON'T GET YOU, CLAUD.

846
00:59:16,833 --> 00:59:19,267
I MEAN, YOU GET STRAIGHT As,

847
00:59:19,301 --> 00:59:21,767
BUT YOU WONDER WHERE THE PLUSSES ARE.

848
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,267
IT'S LIKE YOU WANT TO BE FLORENCE NIGHTINGOWN ALL THE TIME.

849
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,200
NIGHTINGALE, JAMIE.

850
00:59:27,234 --> 00:59:29,733
HER NAME WAS FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.

851
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:34,100
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

852
00:59:34,134 --> 00:59:35,300
HMM?

853
00:59:35,333 --> 00:59:39,366
I THINK I'M GOING TO BE SICK.

854
00:59:43,433 --> 00:59:45,700
WHAT DOES PERSPICACITY MEAN?

855
00:59:45,733 --> 00:59:47,200
I DON'T KNOW.

856
00:59:47,234 --> 00:59:49,433
MAN, IF CLAUDIA WERE HERE, SHE'D KNOW.

857
00:59:51,933 --> 00:59:53,700
IF YOUR SISTER WERE HERE RIGHT NOW,

858
00:59:53,733 --> 00:59:55,933
WE'D BE HOLDING HER IN OUR ARMS...

859
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:58,067
AND JAMIE TOO.

860
01:00:02,533 --> 01:00:04,933
OKAY, UM...

861
01:00:04,967 --> 01:00:07,300
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO ABOUT DINNER?

862
01:00:07,333 --> 01:00:09,667
OH, I DON'T CARE.

863
01:00:11,034 --> 01:00:13,366
DON'T WORRY, MOM. CLAUDIA'S SMART.

864
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,633
I NEVER HEARD YOU SAY THAT BEFORE.

865
01:00:17,667 --> 01:00:20,700
UH, I MEAN, THEY'LL BE FINE,

866
01:00:20,733 --> 01:00:22,967
THE TWO OF THEM TOGETHER.

867
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,700
I HOPE SO.

868
01:00:25,733 --> 01:00:28,733
WHY WOULD THEY DO THIS?

869
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:35,333
CLAUDIA'S ALWAYS BEEN A DREAMER.

870
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,067
MAYBE SHE GOT SICK OF DOING THE LAUNDRY.

871
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,100
Claudia: LUCKY FOR US HE DIDN'T THROW UP ON HIS CLOTHES.

872
01:00:52,933 --> 01:00:55,566
HE'S ASLEEP NOW,

873
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,466
BUT HE'S SWEATING PRETTY BAD.

874
01:01:00,767 --> 01:01:03,333
HE SAID HE'D BE OKAY.

875
01:01:08,034 --> 01:01:10,633
ANGEL...

876
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:13,200
I WISH YOU COULD HEAR ME.

877
01:01:13,234 --> 01:01:16,667
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

878
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:21,500
WHAT IF HE GETS REALLY SICK?

879
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:28,566
IF WE WERE HOME--

880
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,967
I KNOW I OUGHT TO TAKE HIM HOME.

881
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:38,566
I WISH YOU COULD HELP ME.

882
01:02:09,566 --> 01:02:11,167
JAMIE?

883
01:02:13,267 --> 01:02:15,566
( moaning )

884
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,800
WE'RE GOING HOME.

885
01:02:45,767 --> 01:02:48,167
JAMIE? JAMIE?

886
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,134
HMM?

887
01:02:52,366 --> 01:02:55,433
YOU SWEATED YOUR FEVER OUT.

888
01:02:58,733 --> 01:02:59,900
WOW.

889
01:02:59,933 --> 01:03:02,500
WOW WHAT?

890
01:03:04,667 --> 01:03:06,167
NOTHING.

891
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,833
JUST, WOW.

892
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:09,933
UM...

893
01:03:09,967 --> 01:03:12,067
CLAUDIA?

894
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:15,300
CAN WE MAKE A PHONE CALL?

895
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,733
MOM! IT'S JAMIE.

896
01:03:17,767 --> 01:03:19,134
JAMIE?

897
01:03:19,167 --> 01:03:20,301
COLLECT.

898
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:21,967
GIVE ME THAT. JAMIE?

899
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,333
HI, MOM. HOW ARE YOU DOING?

900
01:03:24,366 --> 01:03:25,933
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HOW AM I DOING?

901
01:03:25,967 --> 01:03:27,366
JAMIE, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

902
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,900
WHERE'S YOUR SISTER?

903
01:03:28,933 --> 01:03:30,366
UH-HUH.

904
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,933
CLAUDIA WENT AHEAD. THEY'RE FINE.

905
01:03:32,967 --> 01:03:34,566
THEY'RE GOING TO BREAKFAST.

906
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,800
GET YOUR FATHER. HE'S OUTSIDE.

907
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:38,633
JAMIE, WHY DID YOU DO THIS?

908
01:03:38,667 --> 01:03:41,234
- DAD! PHONE! - WHAT DO YOU MEAN CLAUDIA WENT AHEAD?

909
01:03:41,267 --> 01:03:43,800
UH-HUH? OH, JAMIE, DON'T HANG UP. YOUR FATHER'S COMING IN.

910
01:03:43,833 --> 01:03:45,700
NOW DON'T HANG UP!

911
01:03:45,733 --> 01:03:48,100
RALPH! RALPH!

912
01:03:48,134 --> 01:03:50,967
HEY, BUDDY. ARE YOU REALLY OKAY?

913
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,600
RALPH! RALPH, COME ON!

914
01:03:52,633 --> 01:03:54,067
GOOD.

915
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:56,267
OH, HEY, BY THE WAY, WHERE'S YOUR GLOVE OIL?

916
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,900
ON MY CLOSET FLOOR, I THINK.

917
01:03:58,933 --> 01:04:01,667
UM, WE GOT TO GO, STEVE.

918
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:04,134
TELL MOM AND DAD WE HAVE LOTS OF MONEY. SEE YA.

919
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:08,167
- NO! NO! - STEVE!

920
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,034
HE SAID HE HAS MONEY, BUT HE HAD TO GO.

921
01:04:15,067 --> 01:04:19,333
UH, HIS GLOVE OIL IS ON HIS CLOSET FLOOR.

922
01:04:19,366 --> 01:04:23,134
HE SOUNDED GOOD, REALLY GOOD.

923
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,100
LOOK, JAMIE.

924
01:04:39,134 --> 01:04:42,366
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE ARE HERE JUST BECAUSE OF THE ANGEL.

925
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,833
GOOD. MAYBE ONE OF THEM CAN FIGURE OUT WHO MADE HER.

926
01:04:45,867 --> 01:04:48,466
NO, JAMIE. THAT'S OUR JOB.

927
01:04:50,867 --> 01:04:52,733
Female reporter: Never before has an exhibit

928
01:04:52,767 --> 01:04:54,800
attracted so much attention.

929
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:56,700
Ticket sales are at a record high

930
01:04:56,733 --> 01:04:59,867
and the museum has hired extra staff for the event.

931
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:02,433
- but everyone here has-- - THEY'RE ON TV!

932
01:05:02,466 --> 01:05:04,667
JAMIE AND CLAUDIA ARE ON TV!

933
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,333
- WHAT? - THEY'RE AT THE MUSEUM.

934
01:05:06,366 --> 01:05:08,800
JAMIE AND CLAUDIA ARE AT THE MUSEUM! I SAW THEM JUST NOW!

935
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:11,300
HE WAS WEARING HIS JACKET AND SHE'S WEARING A HAT.

936
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:13,200
I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT HAT BEFORE.

937
01:05:13,234 --> 01:05:15,134
HONEY, ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN IT WAS THEM?

938
01:05:15,167 --> 01:05:17,500
ABSOLUTELY COMPLETELY CERTAIN. NOW LET'S GO.

939
01:05:17,533 --> 01:05:19,167
UH, HONEY?

940
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,234
- WHAT? - HONEY!

941
01:05:21,267 --> 01:05:22,366
WHAT?

942
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,667
YOU'RE NOT DRESSED.

943
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:27,466
I KNOW THAT.

944
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,933
WAIT IN THE CAR. I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

945
01:05:37,466 --> 01:05:39,733
EXCUSE ME. CAN YOU HELP US?

946
01:05:39,767 --> 01:05:41,400
THAT'S PART OF MY JOB.

947
01:05:41,433 --> 01:05:43,034
WE'RE THE KINCAIDS.

948
01:05:43,067 --> 01:05:44,600
OH, RALPH AND EVELYN.

949
01:05:44,633 --> 01:05:46,533
- YES, THAT'S US. - NO, THAT'S THEM.

950
01:05:46,566 --> 01:05:49,500
- RALPH AND EVELYN? - THE BOY IS RALPH, AND THE GIRL IS EVELYN.

951
01:05:49,533 --> 01:05:51,500
THESE CHILDREN ARE NOT RALPH AND EVELYN.

952
01:05:51,533 --> 01:05:53,700
AND I WANT TO KNOW RIGHT NOW, WHY YOU THINK THEY ARE?

953
01:05:53,733 --> 01:05:55,034
OH, THAT'S EVELYN.

954
01:05:55,067 --> 01:05:57,167
EXCUSE ME. I'M MR. JORDAN, THE MUSEUM'S CURATOR.

955
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,833
THIS IS OUR DAUGHTER.

956
01:05:58,867 --> 01:06:01,700
WELL, YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD. SHE'S A VERY GROWN-UP LITTLE GIRL.

957
01:06:01,733 --> 01:06:03,433
HAS ANYTHING HAPPENED TO EVELYN?

958
01:06:03,466 --> 01:06:05,700
I'M EVELYN KINCAID AND THIS IS MY HUSBAND RALPH.

959
01:06:05,733 --> 01:06:09,867
THESE ARE OUR CHILDREN WHO'VE BEEN MISSING FOR THREE DAYS, JAMES AND CLAUDIA.

960
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,533
WE SAW THEM ON THE TV NEWS RIGHT HERE IN YOUR MUSEUM

961
01:06:12,566 --> 01:06:14,167
ONLY AN HOUR AGO.

962
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:17,633
OH. MORRIS, CALL THE POLICE AND ALERT THE STAFF.

963
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,134
MAYBE IF WE LOOK JUST ONE MORE TIME, JAMIE,

964
01:06:22,167 --> 01:06:24,134
I MEAN, REALLY CAREFULLY LOOK AT HER

965
01:06:24,167 --> 01:06:25,867
WHEN NO ONE ELSE IS AROUND.

966
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,267
HEY.

967
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,533
WHAT'S HE DOING?

968
01:06:39,267 --> 01:06:41,667
OH, NOW WE'RE IN DEAD MEAT.

969
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:44,300
JORDAN? JORDAN? MORRIS HERE.

970
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:47,333
I FOUND A BOOK BAG.

971
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,400
IN HERE.

972
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,433
SO FAR THEY FOUND ONE BOOK BAG.

973
01:07:06,466 --> 01:07:08,867
WHAT THAT MEANS EXACTLY, I DON'T KNOW,

974
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,867
BUT IN ANY CASE, THE POLICE ARE ON THEIR WAY.

975
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:13,034
IF THEY'RE IN HERE, WE'LL FIND THEM.

976
01:07:15,533 --> 01:07:17,933
I'D LIKE TO SAY GOODBYE TO THE ANGEL.

977
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:20,100
WELL, I'D LIKE TO STAY OUT OF JAIL.

978
01:07:22,267 --> 01:07:24,067
I'M SORRY, JAMIE.

979
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:26,400
WHAT FOR?

980
01:07:26,433 --> 01:07:28,500
YOU DIDN'T GET TO RESCUE ANYBODY

981
01:07:28,533 --> 01:07:30,566
OR BE A HERO OR ANYTHING.

982
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,167
THAT'S OKAY. THIS IS PRETTY GOOD TOO.

983
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,034
COME ON.

984
01:07:53,533 --> 01:07:55,667
YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T GET?

985
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:58,067
WHY WE DIDN'T SLEEP IN THE WOODS.

986
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:01,301
IF MRS. FRANKENSTEIN OWNED THE ANGEL IN THE FIRST PLACE,

987
01:08:01,333 --> 01:08:04,134
WHY DIDN'T SHE KNOW WHETHER IT WAS REAL OR NOT?

988
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:05,700
GREAT. NOW YOUR FEVER'S BACK.

989
01:08:05,733 --> 01:08:07,967
THE STATUE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FRANKENSTEIN

990
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,667
AND NO ONE KNOWS WHO OWNED HER.

991
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:11,466
( siren wailing )

992
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,800
OH, GREAT. THIS WAY.

993
01:08:13,833 --> 01:08:16,933
WHEN I SAW MOM AND DAD ON TV YESTERDAY,

994
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:18,733
THE NEWS LADY SAID SOMETHING

995
01:08:18,767 --> 01:08:21,100
ABOUT A WOMAN NAMED FRANKENSTEIN OWNING HER.

996
01:08:21,134 --> 01:08:22,667
WHAT?

997
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:24,500
DID THEY SAY WHERE SHE LIVED, JAMIE?

998
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:25,933
UH, NIELSEN HEIGHTS.

999
01:08:25,967 --> 01:08:27,733
AND YOU'RE SURE HER NAME WAS FRANKENSTEIN?

1000
01:08:27,767 --> 01:08:29,433
YUP. UH, NO,

1001
01:08:29,466 --> 01:08:31,733
BUT IT WAS LIKE FRANKENSTEIN.

1002
01:08:31,767 --> 01:08:33,767
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

1003
01:08:45,933 --> 01:08:47,500
JAMIE, IT'S UP TO YOU.

1004
01:08:47,533 --> 01:08:49,333
IF YOU WANT TO GO HOME, YOU CAN TAKE THIS CAB

1005
01:08:49,366 --> 01:08:51,167
AND TELL THEM I'LL BE THERE SOON.

1006
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:54,300
WELL, I KIND OF WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE ANGEL, BUT...

1007
01:08:54,333 --> 01:08:57,566
JAMIE, I SHOULD PROBABLY TELL YOU SOMETHING.

1008
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,200
ARE YOU KIDS COMING, OR WHAT?

1009
01:08:59,234 --> 01:09:01,067
JUST ONE MINUTE, PLEASE.

1010
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:03,333
I DID WANT YOU TO COME BECAUSE OF YOUR MONEY

1011
01:09:03,366 --> 01:09:05,333
AND BECAUSE OF YOUR SENSE OF DIRECTION.

1012
01:09:05,366 --> 01:09:09,900
BUT I'M GLAD YOU CAME BECAUSE...

1013
01:09:09,933 --> 01:09:12,500
YOU'VE BEEN A GOOD FRIEND.

1014
01:09:16,067 --> 01:09:18,034
I DON'T MEAN TO PRESSURE YOU, JAMIE,

1015
01:09:18,067 --> 01:09:20,000
BUT THE GUY'S METER IS RUNNING.

1016
01:09:20,034 --> 01:09:21,800
UH, THEN WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

1017
01:09:21,833 --> 01:09:23,167
LET'S GO.

1018
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:26,667
NIELSEN HEIGHTS, PLEASE.

1019
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:28,600
DO YOU KNOW HOW FAR THAT IS?

1020
01:09:28,633 --> 01:09:32,034
WE HAVE A RELATIVE THERE... DYING.

1021
01:09:32,067 --> 01:09:34,333
BETTER BE A RICH ONE.

1022
01:09:35,733 --> 01:09:37,833
DO WE HAVE MONEY TO PAY FOR THIS, JAMIE?

1023
01:09:37,867 --> 01:09:40,267
YEAH, BUT ONLY ONE WAY.

1024
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:59,067
Morris: THEY SAID YOU DROVE THEM HERE ONE MORNING

1025
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:01,566
TO PICK UP AN INSTRUMENT THEY LEFT BEHIND.

1026
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,700
- I DID NO SUCH THING. - OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T.

1027
01:10:03,733 --> 01:10:07,100
THEN THEY PRETENDED TO WAVE AT YOU IN SOME PARKED CAR.

1028
01:10:07,134 --> 01:10:10,200
THEY WERE QUITE A TEAM-- LITTLE CRIMINALS IN THE MAKING.

1029
01:10:10,234 --> 01:10:12,067
I BEG YOUR PARDON.

1030
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:13,700
THEN THEY TOLD A STORY

1031
01:10:13,733 --> 01:10:16,034
ABOUT HOW THEY REALIZED THEY LEFT IT AT HOME.

1032
01:10:16,067 --> 01:10:17,633
LEFT WHAT AT HOME?

1033
01:10:17,667 --> 01:10:19,967
THAT WOULD BE THE MUSICAL INSTRUMENT.

1034
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,767
I BELIEVE IT WAS A VIOLIN.

1035
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,500
SINCE WE HAVE A POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION,

1036
01:10:25,533 --> 01:10:26,767
I'D LIKE TO MOVE ON,

1037
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,067
FILL IN THE DETAILS LATER.

1038
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,800
THANK YOU, MORRIS.

1039
01:10:33,267 --> 01:10:35,667
NOW... MRS. SIMMS?

1040
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:37,333
THAT BOY WAS SO BRAVE.

1041
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:38,933
HE WAS?

1042
01:10:38,967 --> 01:10:41,533
THEY WANTED HIM TO STAY IN LINE WITH THE OTHERS,

1043
01:10:41,566 --> 01:10:44,833
BUT ON ACCOUNT OF HIS LEG BEING BROKEN IN SO MANY PLACES

1044
01:10:44,867 --> 01:10:48,134
AND THAT PAINFUL PIN STUCK RIGHT IN HIS BONE,

1045
01:10:48,167 --> 01:10:50,733
HE JUST MARCHED RIGHT UP AND SAID,

1046
01:10:50,767 --> 01:10:53,333
EVEN IF IT MEANT RIDICULE FROM HIS PEERS,

1047
01:10:53,366 --> 01:10:55,867
THAT HE JUST HAD TO SIT HIMSELF DOWN.

1048
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:57,867
SO HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO STAND IN LINE.

1049
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:00,000
WOULD HAVE BEEN CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT.

1050
01:11:00,034 --> 01:11:02,867
I TOLD HIM AND THAT TEACHER'S AIDE TO GO RIGHT IN.

1051
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:05,767
THAT SWEET GIRL NEVER LEFT HIS SIDE.

1052
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:09,566
THEY'RE VERY DEVOTED TO ONE ANOTHER.

1053
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,600
Claudia: SO IT'S DEFINITELY FRANK-SOMETHING?

1054
01:11:13,633 --> 01:11:14,800
DEFINITELY.

1055
01:11:14,833 --> 01:11:16,200
FRANKWEINGER, FRANKROLLINSTEIN...

1056
01:11:16,234 --> 01:11:17,667
THAT'S A FRANK-NAME.

1057
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:19,633
BUT IT'S NOT IT.

1058
01:11:19,667 --> 01:11:21,633
FRANKWEED, FRANKWEILER--

1059
01:11:21,667 --> 01:11:23,533
THAT'S IT. THAT'S THE NAME.

1060
01:11:23,566 --> 01:11:25,167
FRANKWEILER.

1061
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,900
IT CAN'T BE IT. THERE'S ONLY ONE

1062
01:11:26,933 --> 01:11:28,366
AND IT'S A MAN-- BASIL--

1063
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,800
E. FRANKWEILER.

1064
01:11:29,833 --> 01:11:32,100
THAT'S IT, CLAUD. I'M POSITIVE.

1065
01:11:32,134 --> 01:11:34,366
COME ON. LET'S GO.

1066
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:17,733
THIS IS IT. YOUR UNCLE MUST BE LOADED.

1067
01:12:17,767 --> 01:12:20,433
ACTUALLY, IT'S OUR AUNT

1068
01:12:20,466 --> 01:12:22,967
AND SHE'S COMFORTABLY WELL-OFF, THANK YOU.

1069
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,633
UM... HOW MUCH DID YOU SAY THAT WAS?

1070
01:12:27,667 --> 01:12:30,366
THAT'LL BE $35.80.

1071
01:12:35,167 --> 01:12:36,767
DID YOU TIP THE DRIVER?

1072
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,600
YEAH. 17¢.

1073
01:12:38,633 --> 01:12:40,034
17¢?

1074
01:12:40,067 --> 01:12:41,500
IT WAS ALL WE HAD. OH.

1075
01:12:53,134 --> 01:12:55,867
THERE'S A BUZZER ON THE GATE.

1076
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:58,200
BUZZ IT.

1077
01:12:58,234 --> 01:12:59,767
OKAY.

1078
01:13:02,034 --> 01:13:04,700
NOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME.

1079
01:13:08,667 --> 01:13:10,600
Man: How may I help you?

1080
01:13:15,867 --> 01:13:19,767
TELL MRS. BASIL E. FRANKWEILER

1081
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,867
THAT CLAUDIA ELEANOR KINCAID

1082
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:26,000
AND JAMES LINCOLN KINCAID

1083
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:30,067
ARE SEEKING INFORMATION ABOUT THE ITALIAN RENAISSANCE.

1084
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:31,867
( whispers ) PLEASE.

1085
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:33,900
PLEASE.

1086
01:13:33,933 --> 01:13:35,234
( buzzing )

1087
01:13:55,366 --> 01:13:56,967
WE'RE BROKE NOW, YOU KNOW.

1088
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,100
WE'RE PROBABLY STUCK HERE FOREVER.

1089
01:13:59,134 --> 01:14:01,167
YOU SHOULD FEEL RIGHT AT HOME.

1090
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,300
THE PLACE LOOKS LIKE A MUSEUM.

1091
01:14:03,333 --> 01:14:05,767
I HOPE SHE'S AT HOME.

1092
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,667
YEAH. I'M STARVING.

1093
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:10,300
JAMIE, WE DIDN'T COME HERE TO EAT.

1094
01:14:19,034 --> 01:14:21,234
( bell tolling )

1095
01:14:25,366 --> 01:14:26,667
COME IN.

1096
01:14:29,833 --> 01:14:31,267
HI.

1097
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,767
YOU PROBABLY DON'T KNOW THIS,

1098
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:36,300
BUT YOUR BOSS HAS AN HONESTY PROBLEM.

1099
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:38,667
SHE GAVE A SCULPTURE TO THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM

1100
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:41,333
AND NOW SHE'S DRIVING A LOT OF PEOPLE GOOFY,

1101
01:14:41,366 --> 01:14:42,967
INCLUDING MY SISTER HERE,

1102
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,400
BECAUSE SHE WON'T--

1103
01:14:44,433 --> 01:14:47,633
SO YOU'RE THE RUNAWAY CHILDREN.

1104
01:14:47,667 --> 01:14:51,234
WE MIGHT BE, BUT WE MIGHT NOT.

1105
01:14:51,267 --> 01:14:53,667
MRS. BASIL E. FRANKWEILER, MAY I INTRODUCE

1106
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:56,600
MISS CLAUDIA AND MASTER JAMES KINCAID?

1107
01:14:56,633 --> 01:14:58,100
HOW DO YOU DO?

1108
01:14:58,134 --> 01:15:01,134
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME IN HERE WITH ME AND SIT DOWN?

1109
01:15:01,167 --> 01:15:03,933
BUT YOU CAN'T BE MRS. FRANKWEILER.

1110
01:15:03,967 --> 01:15:06,034
YOU'RE THE LADY FROM THE MUSEUM.

1111
01:15:06,067 --> 01:15:07,500
SO I AM,

1112
01:15:07,533 --> 01:15:10,633
AND YOU'RE THE BOY WHO WAS WATCHING OUT FOR MY WELFARE.

1113
01:15:10,667 --> 01:15:13,300
WAIT. THAT WAS THE DAY THE EXHIBIT OPENED.

1114
01:15:13,333 --> 01:15:15,000
- MM-HMM. - YEAH.

1115
01:15:15,034 --> 01:15:17,533
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO GO TO THE MUSEUM TO SEE THE ANGEL?

1116
01:15:17,566 --> 01:15:19,733
YOU MUST HAVE SEEN THE ANGEL BEFORE.

1117
01:15:19,767 --> 01:15:21,667
SHE WANTED TO SAY GOODBYE.

1118
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:24,867
WHY DON'T YOU SIT OVER THERE?

1119
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,767
SO, TELL ME,

1120
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,566
WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN THE MUSEUM THAT DAY?

1121
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,200
- WE WERE-- - JUST VISITING.

1122
01:15:32,234 --> 01:15:35,100
OH? THREE DAYS AFTER YOU RAN AWAY?

1123
01:15:35,134 --> 01:15:37,234
WHAT WERE YOU DOING ALL THAT TIME?

1124
01:15:37,267 --> 01:15:38,600
WHO WAS LOOKING AFTER YOU?

1125
01:15:38,633 --> 01:15:41,967
IS YOUR BUTLER CALLING THE POLICE

1126
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,667
WHILE YOU STALL US IN HERE?

1127
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:45,533
OH, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

1128
01:15:45,566 --> 01:15:47,566
Claudia: MRS. FRANKWEILER,

1129
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,600
WE'VE COME TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE ANGEL.

1130
01:15:49,633 --> 01:15:52,100
PEOPLE SAY IT'S THE WORK OF MICHELANGELO

1131
01:15:52,134 --> 01:15:54,134
AND THERE'S HIS MARK ON THE BOTTOM.

1132
01:15:54,167 --> 01:15:56,134
AND WE WANT TO KNOW,

1133
01:15:56,167 --> 01:15:58,867
DID HE REALLY CARVE THE ANGEL?

1134
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:01,433
I SEE.

1135
01:16:01,466 --> 01:16:03,167
I'M SUPPOSED TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS,

1136
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:05,466
BUT THERE'S TO BE NO RECIPROCATION.

1137
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:06,733
MM, PARDON?

1138
01:16:06,767 --> 01:16:08,800
YOU WON'T ANSWER MINE.

1139
01:16:08,833 --> 01:16:10,500
COME ON, CLAUD. LET'S GO. SHE--

1140
01:16:10,533 --> 01:16:12,034
I HAVE TO FIND OUT.

1141
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:14,134
IT'S ALL BEEN WASTED OTHERWISE.

1142
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:18,667
I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE ANGEL.

1143
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:22,900
OH, WELL, NOW WE BOTH HAVE A SECRET.

1144
01:16:22,933 --> 01:16:24,200
VERY INTERESTING.

1145
01:16:24,234 --> 01:16:25,333
CLAUD, PLEASE.

1146
01:16:25,366 --> 01:16:27,800
I'M GOING TO DIE WITHOUT FOOD.

1147
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:29,600
I HAVE FOOD, PLENTY OF FOOD.

1148
01:16:29,633 --> 01:16:32,000
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I THINK IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME.

1149
01:16:32,034 --> 01:16:34,234
WOULD YOU CARE TO JOIN ME?

1150
01:16:34,267 --> 01:16:36,466
- YOU BET! - NO. THANK YOU.

1151
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:39,400
WE'LL FIND OUT ABOUT THE ANGEL, AND THEN WE'LL GO.

1152
01:16:41,034 --> 01:16:43,167
WAIT. I GOT AN IDEA.

1153
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,933
IF YOU TELL US ABOUT THE ANGEL,

1154
01:16:44,967 --> 01:16:46,767
WE'LL TELL YOU WHERE WE'VE BEEN.

1155
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,667
THAT WAY, WE'LL BE EVEN.

1156
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,333
WE CAN EAT AND GO HOME.

1157
01:16:50,366 --> 01:16:52,900
- HOW'S THAT FOR A DEAL? - CLAUDIA?

1158
01:16:54,833 --> 01:16:56,967
OKAY, ON ONE CONDITION.

1159
01:16:58,967 --> 01:17:02,700
IF WE TELL YOU, YOU WON'T TELL ANYONE.

1160
01:17:02,733 --> 01:17:05,366
I HAVE A VERY HEALTHY REGARD FOR SECRETS

1161
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:08,200
AND I SHALL RESPECT YOURS ACCORDINGLY.

1162
01:17:08,234 --> 01:17:10,200
IT'S A DEAL.

1163
01:17:11,733 --> 01:17:15,100
HOW DID YOU KNOW WHO WE ARE AND THAT WE'D RUN AWAY?

1164
01:17:15,134 --> 01:17:17,967
OH, I MANAGE TO KEEP UP WITH THE NEWS

1165
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,833
DESPITE BEING A VIRTUAL RECLUSE.

1166
01:17:20,867 --> 01:17:24,700
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE CAUSED YOUR FAMILY CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE.

1167
01:17:24,733 --> 01:17:27,167
WE LEFT THEM A NOTE.

1168
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,234
HECK, I EVEN CALLED THEM.

1169
01:17:29,267 --> 01:17:30,967
REALLY?

1170
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,200
Claudia: DO YOU LIVE IN THIS HOUSE ALL ALONE?

1171
01:17:33,234 --> 01:17:35,600
APART FROM THE STAFF, YES.

1172
01:17:35,633 --> 01:17:37,500
IT'S KIND OF BIG FOR ONE OLD LADY.

1173
01:17:37,533 --> 01:17:38,767
JAMIE!

1174
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,400
WELL, IT IS BIG,

1175
01:17:40,433 --> 01:17:44,433
OH, BUT I HAVE A LOT OF THINGS-- TOO MANY THINGS.

1176
01:17:44,466 --> 01:17:47,800
I OFTEN THINK OF GIVING THEM ALL AWAY.

1177
01:17:47,833 --> 01:17:49,466
BUT NOT THE ANGEL.

1178
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:50,800
IF I'D OWNED THAT ANGEL,

1179
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:53,400
I WOULD HAVE NEVER SOLD IT OR DONATED IT OR ANYTHING.

1180
01:17:53,433 --> 01:17:55,600
I WOULD HAVE CHERISHED IT FOREVER.

1181
01:17:55,633 --> 01:17:58,433
SHE IS VERY BEAUTIFUL, ISN'T SHE?

1182
01:18:06,067 --> 01:18:08,300
Jamie: WHAT'S ALL THIS?

1183
01:18:08,333 --> 01:18:10,433
THIS, JAMES, IS MY LIFE.

1184
01:18:10,466 --> 01:18:13,867
ALL MY YEARS OF RESEARCH INTO ART,

1185
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:16,234
ANTIQUES, HISTORY, PEOPLE...

1186
01:18:16,267 --> 01:18:18,234
LIFE ITSELF--

1187
01:18:18,267 --> 01:18:20,333
IT'S ALL IN HERE,

1188
01:18:20,366 --> 01:18:22,234
FILED AWAY IN A SPECIAL ORDER

1189
01:18:22,267 --> 01:18:24,234
THAT ONLY MAKES SENSE TO ME.

1190
01:18:24,267 --> 01:18:25,867
THE SECRET OF THE ANGEL?

1191
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:27,667
MM, THAT'S IN HERE TOO.

1192
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:30,633
IN THIS ROOM, THIS IS WHERE YOU'LL FIND IT.

1193
01:18:30,667 --> 01:18:34,333
WAIT. WE'LL FIND IT?

1194
01:18:34,366 --> 01:18:36,833
MEANING, WE HAVE TO LOOK?

1195
01:18:36,867 --> 01:18:38,867
BY OURSELVES?

1196
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:41,333
THAT WOULD TAKE FOR YEARS.

1197
01:18:41,366 --> 01:18:43,700
YOU HAVE ONE HOUR.

1198
01:18:43,733 --> 01:18:45,600
ONE HOUR?

1199
01:18:45,633 --> 01:18:48,034
THAT'S WHEN LUNCH WILL BE READY.

1200
01:18:48,067 --> 01:18:49,700
IF YOU'RE NOT SUCCESSFUL,

1201
01:18:49,733 --> 01:18:51,700
NO LUNCH, NO SECRET.

1202
01:18:51,733 --> 01:18:55,134
JUST A CALL TO YOUR PARENTS TO TELL THEM TO COME AND GET YOU.

1203
01:18:56,566 --> 01:18:59,400
PLAYING GAMES IS FUN, ISN'T IT?

1204
01:18:59,433 --> 01:19:01,533
GOOD LUCK.

1205
01:19:18,533 --> 01:19:22,800
WAIT. FIVE MINUTES OF PLANNING IS WORTH 15 MINUTES OF WORK.

1206
01:19:22,833 --> 01:19:25,600
WE'RE MAKING A LIST.

1207
01:19:25,633 --> 01:19:29,366
THE LIST OF SUBJECTS FOR WHICH WE'LL LOOK IS...

1208
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,134
MICHELANGELO, ONE.

1209
01:19:31,167 --> 01:19:32,633
BUONARROTI, TWO.

1210
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:34,067
WHAT'S THAT?

1211
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:35,867
MICHELANGELO'S LAST NAME.

1212
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:37,833
ANGEL, THREE.

1213
01:19:37,867 --> 01:19:41,100
AUCTION, FOUR.

1214
01:19:41,134 --> 01:19:43,167
METROPOLITAN MUSEUM, FIVE.

1215
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,767
UH, ITALIAN RENAISSANCE?

1216
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,900
SIX.

1217
01:19:46,933 --> 01:19:49,767
PAINTERS, SEVEN.

1218
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:53,234
SCULPTURES, EIGHT, AND MARBLE, NINE.

1219
01:19:53,267 --> 01:19:54,833
MARBLE, NINE.

1220
01:19:54,867 --> 01:19:58,500
ROME, ITALY, AND FLORENCE, ITALY, 10 AND 11.

1221
01:19:58,533 --> 01:20:00,100
I'LL TAKE THE ODDS.

1222
01:20:00,134 --> 01:20:02,466
WHY DOESN'T THAT SURPRISE ME?

1223
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,334
WAIT A MINUTE. THERE'S MORE ODDS THAN EVENS.

1224
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:06,300
- SO I'LL TAKE THE EVENS. - TALK ABOUT WASTING TIME.

1225
01:20:06,334 --> 01:20:08,400
- TAKE THIS. - OKAY.

1226
01:21:00,633 --> 01:21:03,134
MRS. FRANKWEILER ASKS THAT I ADVISE YOU

1227
01:21:03,167 --> 01:21:07,566
YOU HAVE THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR REMAINING.

1228
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,900
I SHALL RETURN AT THE HALF.

1229
01:21:54,933 --> 01:21:57,566
MRS. FRANKWEILER HAS ASKED ME TO ANNOUNCE

1230
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,667
THE HALF HOUR.

1231
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,867
- THIS IS WEIRD. - BUT WE FIT RIGHT IN.

1232
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:08,566
COME ON, WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. HURRY.

1233
01:22:40,533 --> 01:22:42,500
HMM.

1234
01:22:42,533 --> 01:22:46,500
YOU HAVE 15 MINUTES REMAINING.

1235
01:22:46,533 --> 01:22:48,134
GOOD LUCK.

1236
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:11,034
I'M SORRY, JAMIE.

1237
01:23:11,067 --> 01:23:13,334
YOU MADE A GOOD LIST.

1238
01:23:13,366 --> 01:23:15,533
WE MADE THE LIST,

1239
01:23:15,566 --> 01:23:17,867
BUT TO QUOTE YOU, "WE'RE DEAD MEAT."

1240
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:20,466
WE MIGHT AS WELL GO TELL MRS. FRANKWEILER.

1241
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:23,067
I SUPPOSE.

1242
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,200
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

1243
01:23:27,234 --> 01:23:29,500
I THINK SHE HAD US ON A WILD GOOSE CHASE.

1244
01:23:29,533 --> 01:23:32,700
I'M NOT SURE THERE EVEN IS A FILE ON WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

1245
01:23:32,733 --> 01:23:34,200
IF YOU ASK ME,

1246
01:23:34,234 --> 01:23:37,267
ALL THIS STUFF IS ONE BIG PIECE OF BALONEY.

1247
01:23:40,134 --> 01:23:42,500
JAMIE, WHAT DID YOU SAY JUST NOW?

1248
01:23:42,533 --> 01:23:44,034
WHAT?

1249
01:23:44,067 --> 01:23:45,067
YOU SAID BALONEY.

1250
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:46,167
ACTUALLY, YOU SAID BAH-LONEY--

1251
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,967
BALONEY IS A WORD. I CAN SAY BALONEY.

1252
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,067
OF COURSE YOU CAN SAY, JAMIE. OF COURSE IT'S A WORD.

1253
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:51,800
IT'S A LUNCH MEAT...

1254
01:23:51,833 --> 01:23:54,034
AND IT'S A CITY IN ITALY.

1255
01:23:54,067 --> 01:23:56,100
- BALONEY? - BOLOGNA.

1256
01:23:56,134 --> 01:23:58,400
ONE OF THE LIBRARY BOOKS SAID SOMETHING ABOUT BOLOGNA.

1257
01:24:00,933 --> 01:24:02,500
HERE IT IS.

1258
01:24:02,533 --> 01:24:05,334
COME ON. OPEN IT.

1259
01:24:05,366 --> 01:24:08,267
AND AFTER ALL THIS, IT'S IN GREEK.

1260
01:24:08,301 --> 01:24:10,301
ITALIAN OR LATIN OR SOMETHING.

1261
01:24:10,334 --> 01:24:11,967
IT'S SOME KIND OF POEM, JAMIE.

1262
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,767
- WELL, WHAT'S IT MEAN? - HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

1263
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:17,134
HEY! THERE IT IS.

1264
01:24:17,167 --> 01:24:18,633
MY ANGEL.

1265
01:24:21,433 --> 01:24:24,067
AND AN AUTOGRAPH.

1266
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:26,334
MICHELANGELO.

1267
01:24:26,366 --> 01:24:28,200
IT'S HIM. HIS SIGNATURE.

1268
01:24:28,234 --> 01:24:31,667
THAT PROVES IT, JAMIE.

1269
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:34,334
SHE'S HIS. HE MADE HER.

1270
01:24:34,366 --> 01:24:36,267
HE DREW THIS, JAMIE, 400 YEARS AGO.

1271
01:24:36,301 --> 01:24:38,900
HE TOUCHED THIS.

1272
01:24:38,933 --> 01:24:42,067
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. IT'S TRUE.

1273
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:43,667
SHE'S NOT A FAKE.

1274
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:46,000
SHE'S REAL. ANGEL.

1275
01:24:46,034 --> 01:24:47,366
( door opens )

1276
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:51,633
WELL, MY DEARS, THE HOUR IS UP.

1277
01:24:51,667 --> 01:24:53,566
DO WE HAVE A RESULT?

1278
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:58,867
YOU FOUND IT.

1279
01:25:00,334 --> 01:25:02,366
IN EUROPE AFTER THE WAR,

1280
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,867
THERE WAS AN ITALIAN NOBLEMAN

1281
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:06,134
WHOSE COMPANY I RATHER ENJOYED.

1282
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:08,500
- WAS HE A PRINCE? - YES, HE WAS.

1283
01:25:08,533 --> 01:25:10,200
AND HE GAVE YOU THE ANGEL.

1284
01:25:10,234 --> 01:25:14,767
NO. HE GAVE ME MANY THINGS. AND HE COULD DO A LOT.

1285
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,933
BUT HE WAS A VERY BAD POKER PLAYER.

1286
01:25:17,967 --> 01:25:20,533
YOU WON THE ANGEL IN A CARD GAME.

1287
01:25:20,566 --> 01:25:23,633
BUT THE QUESTION IS, DID SHE CHEAT?

1288
01:25:23,667 --> 01:25:26,366
ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY UNSURE

1289
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,134
OF THEMSELVES CHEAT, JAMES.

1290
01:25:32,167 --> 01:25:34,134
THIS IS REALLY GOOD FOOD.

1291
01:25:34,167 --> 01:25:35,700
THANK YOU.

1292
01:25:35,733 --> 01:25:38,067
I THINK IT'S MY TURN TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS.

1293
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:40,933
TELL ME, WHAT DID YOU LIKE BEST ABOUT RUNNING AWAY?

1294
01:25:40,967 --> 01:25:42,267
UM...

1295
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:45,300
NOT HAVING A SCHEDULE, I GUESS.

1296
01:25:45,334 --> 01:25:47,933
YOU KNOW, LIKE, DO YOUR HOMEWORK,

1297
01:25:47,967 --> 01:25:49,967
TAKE YOUR SHOWER, BRUSH YOUR TEETH,

1298
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,334
DO YOUR SIT-UPS.

1299
01:25:51,366 --> 01:25:52,566
WHAT ELSE?

1300
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:56,433
WELL, AT HOME, I ALWAYS SEEM TO GET IT WRONG.

1301
01:25:56,466 --> 01:26:00,500
AND EVEN THOUGH SHE ONLY WANTED ME TO COME

1302
01:26:00,533 --> 01:26:02,234
BECAUSE OF MY MONEY,

1303
01:26:02,267 --> 01:26:05,767
THIS TIME I GOT IT RIGHT.

1304
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:07,366
I KNOW.

1305
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,600
CLAUDIA TREATED YOU AS AN EQUAL,

1306
01:26:09,633 --> 01:26:11,900
SO THAT GAVE YOU SELF-CONFIDENCE.

1307
01:26:15,433 --> 01:26:17,566
YEAH.

1308
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,134
OKAY, CLAUDIA, YOU TELL ME NOW

1309
01:26:19,167 --> 01:26:22,533
WHAT DID YOU LIKE BEST ABOUT RUNNING AWAY?

1310
01:26:22,566 --> 01:26:24,967
DISCOVERING THE ANGEL.

1311
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I WANTED TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT HER...

1312
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:32,600
WHERE SHE CAME FROM, WHO THOUGHT OF HER,

1313
01:26:32,633 --> 01:26:34,600
WHO MADE HER.

1314
01:26:34,633 --> 01:26:37,366
I WANTED TO MAKE HER PART OF ME.

1315
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,767
DID IT WORK?

1316
01:26:42,466 --> 01:26:44,200
I DON'T KNOW.

1317
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:49,500
THERE'S ONE THING I'VE LEARNED IN MY LIFE--

1318
01:26:49,533 --> 01:26:52,767
I BELIEVE YOU SHOULD LEARN A NEW THING EVERY DAY.

1319
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,833
I DON'T QUITE AGREE WITH THAT.

1320
01:26:54,867 --> 01:26:57,466
OH, I THINK LEARNING IS VERY IMPORTANT,

1321
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:01,466
BUT I THINK FEELINGS MATTER JUST AS MUCH.

1322
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:05,733
THAT'S WHAT THE ANGEL WAS TRYING TO TELL ME.

1323
01:27:05,767 --> 01:27:07,633
MAYBE.

1324
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:12,300
YOU THINK YOU SHOULD RING YOUR PARENTS NOW?

1325
01:27:12,334 --> 01:27:13,733
YOU BET.

1326
01:27:13,767 --> 01:27:15,100
I GUESS SO.

1327
01:27:15,134 --> 01:27:17,334
THEY MUST BE VERY ANXIOUS, WANTING YOU BACK.

1328
01:27:17,366 --> 01:27:19,733
THE TELEPHONE IS RIGHT IN THERE.

1329
01:27:19,767 --> 01:27:22,867
IT'LL ALL BE OVER WHEN MOM AND DAD COME TO PICK US UP,

1330
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:25,134
THE WHOLE ADVENTURE.

1331
01:27:25,167 --> 01:27:28,234
WE'LL GO HOME AND EVERYTHING WILL BE AS IT WAS BEFORE.

1332
01:27:28,267 --> 01:27:30,034
OH, NOT QUITE.

1333
01:27:30,067 --> 01:27:32,334
YOU STILL HAVE THE SECRET OF THE ANGEL

1334
01:27:32,366 --> 01:27:34,867
TO ALWAYS REMIND YOU OF THIS ADVENTURE

1335
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:36,667
AND HOW IT'S CHANGED YOU INSIDE.

1336
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:38,933
IF YOU FIND THE MEMORY FADING,

1337
01:27:38,967 --> 01:27:41,300
YOU'LL HAVE SOMETHING TO BRING IT BACK TO YOU.

1338
01:27:41,334 --> 01:27:43,034
W-WHAT SOMETHING?

1339
01:27:43,067 --> 01:27:46,234
MICHELANGELO'S SKETCH AND SONNET.

1340
01:27:46,267 --> 01:27:48,400
YOU'RE GIVING IT TO US?

1341
01:27:48,433 --> 01:27:50,300
YES, IF YOU'D LIKE.

1342
01:27:50,334 --> 01:27:53,134
DON'T YOU THINK YOU OUGHT TO GIVE IT TO THE PEOPLE AT THE MUSEUM?

1343
01:27:53,167 --> 01:27:54,867
LET THEM KNOW THE TRUTH?

1344
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:56,833
OH, NO. KEEP THEM GUESSING.

1345
01:27:56,867 --> 01:27:59,366
THEY NEED A LITTLE MYSTERY IN THEIR LIVES.

1346
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:01,466
I'D MUCH RATHER YOU HAVE IT.

1347
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:05,234
HEY, I BET IT'S WORTH MILLIONS.

1348
01:28:05,267 --> 01:28:07,234
WE COULD SELL IT TO THE MUSEUM,

1349
01:28:07,267 --> 01:28:09,000
MAKE A PACKET!

1350
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:11,234
JAMIE!

1351
01:28:11,267 --> 01:28:14,067
I'M SORRY, MRS. FRANKWEILER,

1352
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:17,234
BUT MAYBE IT'S NOT SUCH A GOOD IDEA GIVING IT TO ME

1353
01:28:17,267 --> 01:28:19,234
'CAUSE I'M NOT THAT GOOD WITH SECRETS,

1354
01:28:19,267 --> 01:28:20,900
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE WORTH MONEY.

1355
01:28:20,933 --> 01:28:23,500
OH, BUT YOU'LL BE QUITE SAFE, JAMIE.

1356
01:28:23,533 --> 01:28:25,800
I'LL LEAVE IT TO YOU IN MY WILL.

1357
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:29,100
BY THEN I WON'T CARE WHO KNOWS AND YOU CAN SELL IT FOR AS MUCH AS YOU'D LIKE.

1358
01:28:29,134 --> 01:28:32,433
BUT UNTIL THEN, IT'LL BE OUR SECRET--

1359
01:28:32,466 --> 01:28:36,667
YOURS TO ENJOY THINKING HOW MUCH IT'S WORTH

1360
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:40,100
AND CLAUDIA'S TO REMIND HER HOW SPECIAL SHE IS

1361
01:28:40,134 --> 01:28:43,300
AND MINE TO REMEMBER YOU BY.

1362
01:28:51,667 --> 01:28:53,234
COME HERE. COME HERE.

1363
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:56,733
Mother: WE MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

1364
01:28:57,867 --> 01:28:59,533
HEY, SWEETIE.

1365
01:29:16,267 --> 01:29:19,366
Mrs. Frankweiler: AND THAT IS WHAT BROUGHT JAMES AND CLAUDIA KINCAID

1366
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:21,000
INTO MY LIFE.

1367
01:29:21,034 --> 01:29:24,167
I LOOKED FORWARD TO SEEING THEM AGAIN.

1368
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:28,533
AFTER ALL, SOMEONE HAD TO TIDY UP MY LIBRARY.

1369
01:29:28,566 --> 01:29:30,700
AND I'M PLEASED TO SAY THEY DID,

1370
01:29:30,733 --> 01:29:33,466
WITH JUST A LITTLE HELP FROM PARKS AND MYSELF.

1371
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:36,700
AS FOR THE MUSEUM AND ITS STAFF,

1372
01:29:36,733 --> 01:29:39,366
THINGS CONTINUED MUCH AS THEY ALWAYS HAD

1373
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:42,067
DESPITE THE FRUSTRATION OF NOT BEING ABLE

1374
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:44,933
TO AUTHENTICATE THE ANGEL AS A MICHELANGELO,

1375
01:29:44,967 --> 01:29:47,267
WHICH WAS A CONSIDERABLE LOSS,

1376
01:29:47,301 --> 01:29:50,600
BUT WAS PERHAPS COMPENSATED FOR

1377
01:29:50,633 --> 01:29:53,100
BY THE UNFOLDING OF ANOTHER MYSTERY,

1378
01:29:53,134 --> 01:29:56,700
THE ANSWER TO WHICH WAS ALSO NEVER FOUND,

1379
01:29:56,733 --> 01:29:59,267
ALTHOUGH SUSPECTED BY SOME.

1380
01:30:02,767 --> 01:30:06,301
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT A LITTLE MYSTERY IS A GOOD THING.

1381
01:30:06,334 --> 01:30:09,566
IT CAN BRING MAGIC INTO ANYONE'S LIFE.

1382
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
I SHOULD KNOW.
