1
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,278
Please let me go home.
Please, I'm not who you think I am.

2
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,790
I'm really not who you think I am.

3
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,631
Please. Please. I'm not a spy.

4
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,438
- Please let me go home.
- Try again.

5
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,238
I am not a spy.
I am a businesswoman.

6
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,233
I work for Rink Petroleum and Gas.

7
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,152
Please call them.
I work for Rink Petroleum.

8
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,793
You are here to sabotage
our nuclear ambitions. Yes?

9
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,758
I am not a spy! I am not a spy!

10
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,674
- Try again.
- I am not a spy.

11
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,398
- You are a spy.
- I am not a spy.

12
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,834
Don't lie to me.

13
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,553
I am not a spy.

14
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,314
I am not a spy.

15
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,512
<i>It is through the grace</i>
<i>and munificence...</i>

16
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,955
<i>... of our glorious Dear Leader...</i>

17
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,597
<i>... that the Democratic People's</i>
<i>Republic of Korea...</i>

18
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,273
<i>... for her hostile acts</i>
<i>against our socialist nation.</i>

19
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,830
Keep your head down. Don't say
anything till we make the swap.

20
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,473
In case Kim Jong II here
changes his mind.

21
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,793
Exchange.

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,956
Right face!

23
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,077
Right face!

24
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,595
I don't understand.

25
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,910
You don't understand what?

26
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,394
All the rules say to leave me,
that one life...

27
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,199
...is not worth blowing
operational cover.

28
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,509
You got that right.

29
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,509
If we have to lose someone
for the greater good, we will.

30
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,669
So why did you do it?

31
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,513
Well, I didn't do it.

32
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,152
He did.

33
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,193
Once he found out where you were,
there was no stopping him.

34
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,754
He petitioned the Senate,
the State Department.

35
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,832
We didn't need the publicity
so I figured we better do something...

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,390
...or he's gonna invade this
goddamn rice-paddy republic himself.

37
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,198
You okay?

38
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,633
Yeah.

39
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,548
Hey.

40
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,349
- Good morning.
- Happy anniversary.

41
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,392
You want me to make you breakfast?

42
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,869
How about pancakes?

43
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,917
Your cooking?

44
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,997
You're joking. You like my cooking.

45
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,071
Germans don't joke.

46
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,076
Burt likes my cooking.

47
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,793
Get your bugs off the table.

48
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,951
- They're spiders.
- They're bugs.

49
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,876
- They're spiders.
- They're bugs.

50
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,473
<i>Fold the next layer back</i>
<i>as you did the two before it.</i>

51
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,076
<i>Turn the napkin over.</i>
<i>Fold both sides back...</i>

52
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,959
<i>... and over one another</i>
<i>about a third of the way.</i>

53
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,235
<i>Check for symmetry</i>
<i>and press the fold down well.</i>

54
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,436
Are you doing this
on company time?

55
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,115
<i>- And insert your fav ourite silverware...</i>
- It's my anniversary.

56
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,479
And I want it to be perfect.

57
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,119
But...

58
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,719
...that is not sexy.

59
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,470
No, but it is utilitarian.

60
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,710
And utilitarian is the new sexy.

61
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,318
I ran the trace. First name Usam,
last name Utsaev.

62
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,913
- Any verifiable hits?
- One.

63
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,277
Hey, Francis, do me a favour and
stick that in the safe till tomorrow.

64
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,431
Mata Hari here's
got a big night tonight.

65
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,716
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

66
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,718
"Sir"? Do I look like a "sir" to you?

67
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,869
From head to toe.

68
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,035
I'm surprised he didn't call you
"Your Majesty."

69
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,193
I like the ring of that.
I think I'd prefer "Your Majesty."

70
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,952
Was I ever that young?

71
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,275
Younger.

72
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,678
Walk me out.

73
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,551
How did the Oval Office briefing go?

74
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,472
Oh, you know. The usual.

75
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,949
President wants to know
what's happening in Russia...

76
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,908
...the day before it happens. How about
you? I heard that interview went well.

77
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,718
Fingers crossed.

78
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,032
You sure about this?

79
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,033
You know, once you start pushing
paper, there's no turning back.

80
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,431
I had the strangest feeling
when I was out last time.

81
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,955
- I was homesick.
- Homesick?

82
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,350
- Sir! Sir!
- Can't you take something for that?

83
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,914
We got a walk-in.
A defector, 10 minutes ago.

84
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,310
- Here?
- I guess he's not buying our cover.

85
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,391
- Did you get his bona fides?
- He's Russian.

86
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,596
He says he's FSB
but won't give us any more.

87
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,877
- He's a strange guy.
- How's his English?

88
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,078
Passable. Not great.

89
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,993
But if it got down to
the subtleties of English nuance...

90
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,630
- Ted, Mike's gonna be waiting for me.
- Yeah, and I got a plane to catch.

91
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,789
Come on, Salt.

92
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,997
No one can sort out a nutjob
from the real thing faster than you.

93
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,072
- I got 25 minutes.
- I got 26. Let's go.

94
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,718
Yeah, okay. Well, we'll decide
when we know more.

95
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,037
- Who called Counterintelligence?
- Not me.

96
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,714
Hey, Ted. We're crashing the party.

97
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,557
- Peabody.
- Salt.

98
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,237
Please remove the hood.

99
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,833
Microphones are on.

100
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,877
Checking levels.

101
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,468
Baseline recorded.

102
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,393
Neural scan is up. Ready to go.

103
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,469
- Ev.
- Yeah.

104
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,710
Commencing audio
and visual recording.

105
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,430
<i>Testing earpiece.</i>

106
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,752
Interview has commenced at 1442.

107
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,077
You're married.

108
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,432
A husband must be a distraction...

109
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,078
...for a female intelligence officer.

110
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,310
Well, we're here to talk about you.

111
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,589
So, what is your name?

112
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,998
My name is...

113
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,358
...Oleg Vassilyevich Orlov.

114
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,551
I have cancer.

115
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,676
I'm moved.

116
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,871
A defector with cancer.

117
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,916
Are you selling secrets for chemo
or are you afraid of dying?

118
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,551
If I have gained anything
by damning myself...

119
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,557
...it is that I no longer
have anything to fear.

120
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,040
<i>Russia is also dying.</i>

121
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,476
<i>- But unlik</i> e <i>me, she's not dead.</i>
- Oleg Vassily Orlov...

122
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,189
...shows up in 1993
in Novosibirsk Oblast, Siberia.

123
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,550
He was on Victor Barisovsky's
staff there.

124
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,954
<i>He checks out as FSB, Ev.</i>

125
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,873
Scan says he's truthful
on the cancer.

126
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,389
Prior to '93?

127
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,712
<i>- Russia was once strong, powerful...</i>
- Nothing.

128
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,155
He doesn't exist.

129
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,915
<i>And she will be again</i>
<i>when things have been set back...</i>

130
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,997
...on the correct path.

131
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,834
I have somewhere I need to be,
Mr. Orlov...

132
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,468
...so if you wouldn't mind
getting to the point.

133
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,592
I came here to tell you a story.

134
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,198
I don't like stories.

135
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,034
But I'll listen anyway.

136
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,031
In English, please.

137
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,914
Others are listening.

138
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,673
1975.

139
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,270
The Cold War.

140
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,716
<i>In a gymnasium in Grozny...</i>

141
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,030
<i>... a Soviet Olympic wrestler...</i>

142
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,590
<i>... named Sasha Fyorodovich</i>
<i>Chenk ov...</i>

143
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,599
<i>... meets for the first</i> time...

144
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,914
<i>... the only female chess grand master</i>
<i>of her era:</i>

145
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,590
<i>Anja Nurekyova.</i>

146
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,838
<i>Within a month, they were married.</i>

147
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,310
<i>And within a year, a child.</i>

148
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,791
<i>One month</i> more...

149
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,839
...the child was back
in the same hospital...

150
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,319
...sick with fever.

151
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,035
<i>And within days after that...</i>

152
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,636
<i>... the child suddenly was dead.</i>

153
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,429
<i>Yes, a child was dead.</i>

154
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,639
<i>And, yes, a child was buried.</i>

155
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,959
<i>But the Chenk ov baby was alive...</i>

156
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,318
<i>... and became the property</i>
<i>of another man.</i>

157
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,679
<i>A master spy who had</i>
<i>devised the greatest plan...</i>

158
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,992
<i>... a Russian patriot</i>
<i>could ever invent.</i>

159
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,312
<i>A plan to destroy America.</i>

160
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,832
<i>It had all started...</i>

161
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,788
...with an American named
Lee Harvey Oswald.

162
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,919
<i>In 1959, he emigrated to Russia.</i>

163
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,878
<i>Three years later, he returned home.</i>

164
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,713
<i>But the man</i>
<i>who came back to America...</i>

165
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,113
<i>... was in fact a Russian spy</i>
<i>named Alek.</i>

166
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,870
<i>On November 22nd, 1963...</i>

167
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,679
<i>... Alek became the first success</i>
<i>of the new programme...</i>

168
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,916
<i>... and a hero of the Soviet Union.</i>

169
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,078
<i>The spymaster was now</i>
<i>given the go-ahead...</i>

170
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,959
<i>... to create many more lik</i> e <i>Alek.</i>

171
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,873
<i>Scores of agents,</i>
<i>males and females...</i>

172
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,114
<i>... to be substituted for Americans.</i>

173
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,795
I pledge allegiance to the flag...

174
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,031
<i>At an abandoned monastery...</i>

175
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,077
<i>... Chenk ov and other boys and girls</i>
<i>learned English...</i>

176
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,394
...long before they learned Russian.

177
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,596
Drilled in idiom...

178
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,876
<i>... idiosyncrasy and...</i>

179
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,115
...ideology.

180
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,236
<i>And by methods of rigorous physical</i>
<i>and psychological programming...</i>

181
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,358
<i>... the spymaster</i>
<i>made warriors of iron.</i>

182
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,751
<i>Unquestioning and unbreakable.</i>

183
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,073
Who crossed first?

184
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,909
Who crossed last?

185
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,635
You're killing me, man.

186
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,917
When does the good fairy come in?

187
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,952
Never.

188
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,792
It's a story without hope.

189
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,751
Chenkov was matched with the child
of a visiting American family.

190
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,310
There was an accident.
The family died.

191
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,313
Chenkov was sent to America...

192
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,711
...to live a complete lie...

193
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,589
...and to patiently await the day
to attack from within.

194
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,716
Day X.

195
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,192
The long-awaited mission is here.

196
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,713
Chenkov will travel
to New York City...

197
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,873
...to kill the president of Russia...

198
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,356
...at the funeral of
the American vice president.

199
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,274
Chenkov is KA 12.

200
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,509
- "KA."
- Cold War legend.

201
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,432
Highly trained
Russian sleeper agents...

202
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,309
...inserted into American society
to sabotage and assassinate.

203
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,189
Supposedly they'd wait years
to strike. Decades, even.

204
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,675
Supposedly.

205
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,312
- What, you don't believe in moles?
- I believe in moles, all right.

206
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,754
Just not the bogeyman.

207
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,753
Especially if the plan is
to kill their own president.

208
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,751
This guy's selling smoke.

209
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,751
Wrap it up, Ev.

210
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,991
So a Russian agent is going to kill
the Russian president? Is that it?

211
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,593
Okay.

212
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,916
Thank you very much.

213
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,516
And what would you like
in return for that information?

214
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,274
I simply wish to help you do...

215
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,749
...what you need to do.

216
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,037
You're good.

217
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,709
The KA programme
is brilliant bullshit.

218
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,791
But I'm officially off duty...

219
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,436
...so you can tell the rest of your
little story to one of my colleagues.

220
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,592
- Salt.
- Yes?

221
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,914
The name of the Russian agent
is Salt.

222
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,431
Evelyn Salt.

223
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,551
My name is Evelyn Salt.

224
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,711
Then you are a Russian spy.

225
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,349
<i>Truthful.</i>

226
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:07,079
So far the fMRI scan registers truthful
on everything he's said.

227
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,759
Ted?

228
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,720
Call Protective Services,
make sure they find my husband.

229
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,440
- I need to get to the phone.
- Not after the neural scan.

230
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,273
I can beat that thing
five times out of six.

231
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,317
I am trained to, and so is he.

232
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,990
I need my phone.
I need to call my husband.

233
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,629
- Let me call my husband.
- Let me see it.

234
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,950
There's a reason he mentioned
my wedding ring, Ted.

235
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,838
They don't just blow up their cover...

236
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,389
...they blow up their whole cover life.
You know that.

237
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,074
- Do you remember Henley's wife?
- Yes, I do.

238
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,674
Speaker.

239
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,472
<i>Please leave a message</i>
<i>after the tone. Thanks. Bye.</i>

240
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,234
Honey, it's me. Please call me
as soon as you get this.

241
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,356
Okay, sweetheart?
As soon as you get this.

242
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,750
Godspeed, Comrade Chenkov.

243
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,713
Someone interrogate that piece of shit.
Someone who enjoys getting answers.

244
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,276
Look, Ev, try to stay calm.

245
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,069
- I'm not a goddamn Russian spy.
- I didn't say you were.

246
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,276
Let's go up to my office,
we can sort this out.

247
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,398
No, no. We gotta go to
a secure location. Now.

248
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,788
All right.

249
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,549
Doesn't get any more secure
than this.

250
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,752
Ev? Five minutes.

251
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,395
- Call Protective Services, find Mike.
- I will.

252
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,630
This is bullshit.

253
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,237
Give us a sec, we'll be right in.

254
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,711
I know we're heading
into your jurisdiction.

255
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,598
- I'm just asking for five minutes.
- No.

256
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,158
If I have to. You can't have
five minutes. I have to talk to her.

257
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,629
- She's scared. Don't you see that?
- I don't care.

258
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,031
There is a mole in Russia house, Ted.
There is a mole. I am sure.

259
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,476
Please step in the elevator.

260
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,951
- Russian president, okay? So I'm
gonna ask you to step out of my way.

261
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,951
What the hell is that?

262
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,515
Sir.

263
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,552
I gotta pee.

264
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,269
<i>- Where do you think he went?</i>
<i>- No one saw him coming out the front.</i>

265
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,155
- Jesus Christ.
- Here he is again.

266
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,551
No sign of him so far on the street.

267
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,952
It's two minutes ago,
before lockdown.

268
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,634
- Anything clean on him?
- We just got a match, sir.

269
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,438
It's May Day, 1981.

270
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,716
There's Brezhnev. And there...

271
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,949
- Orlov.
- That's him.

272
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,873
He used to be a heavyweight
once upon a time.

273
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,037
Get that photo out.
Every ticket counter...

274
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,112
...airport, train station, taxi dispatcher,
the whole nine yards.

275
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,317
- Get me Medford on a secure line.
- Yes, sir.

276
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,039
- Top-right screen. Is that live?
- Yes, sir.

277
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,519
Where is she going? Track her.

278
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,960
<i>No one may leave the building.</i>

279
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,271
Rink Petroleum, Security.

280
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,238
Yes, you have a woman to your left,
behind you. Evelyn Salt.

281
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,678
- We lost the visual on her.
- Damn it. Where'd she go?

282
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,592
<i>We are on security lockdown.</i>

283
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,471
Dave? It's Evelyn, is Mike there?

284
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,875
<i>No, I'm sorry. He left after lunch.</i>

285
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,553
<i>Hey, happy anniversary, huh?</i>

286
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,312
The stairwell.

287
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,915
- Second floor.
- What's on that floor?

288
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,640
- It's empty, a security buffer.
- Isolate and seal it.

289
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,713
Get her records to my handheld.

290
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,438
East corridor.

291
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,832
<i>Notifying Metropolitan Police.</i>

292
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,992
Kill the power to the elevator doors.

293
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,195
We got her.

294
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,595
<i>Locking down all floors.</i>

295
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,075
<i>Security Protective Service</i>
<i>responding to threat.</i>

296
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,070
All right. Get a tactical team
to meet me on the south stairwell.

297
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,310
- Yes, sir.
- Director Medford, sir.

298
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,232
Get me a side arm.

299
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,234
I'll call her back.

300
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,873
- Shit.
- Lost visual.

301
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,678
Where is she, Albert? Talk to me.

302
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,873
Come on.

303
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,197
North hallway.

304
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,190
There, interrogation room,
bring it up.

305
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,515
Switch down, switch down.

306
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,158
- Have you found him?
<i>- What the hell are you doing, Ev?</i>

307
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,435
This doesn't look good.

308
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,274
- Let's do it.
- Move.

309
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,796
There's a tac team coming at you
in 30 seconds.

310
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,359
Get your panties off the camera.

311
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,590
<i>Get where we can</i> see <i>you</i>
<i>so you don't get hurt.</i>

312
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,638
- Have you found my husband?
<i>- These boys aren't fooling around.</i>

313
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,680
<i>Please. I can't help you</i>
<i>unless you talk to</i> me.

314
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,319

<i>Sweeping corridors</i>
<i>outside the elevator.</i>

316
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,119
Put the masks on.

317

Situation is hot.

318
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,349
<i>Open the door about two feet.</i>
<i>We're gonna gas her.</i>

319
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,751
- Tac team in position. Waiting for a go.
- Is that absolutely necessary?

320
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,638
What, you want me to shoot her?

321
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,916
Get a medical team in place now.

322
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,518
We're ready.

323
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,755
Now.

324
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,197
<i>Okay, on my count.</i>

325
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,750
Three, two, one. Go.

326
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,713
Jesus Christ.

327
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,072
Where is she? Come on, guys.

328
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,993
- Find her, Albert. Now.
<i>- Suspect has escaped.</i>

329
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,118
There. Bring that up.

330
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,831
Stay with her,
she's crossing the street.

331
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,433
Pan the goddamn camera.

332
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,832
Back that up and zoom in.

333
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,719
- We're looking for Michael Krause.
- Freeze.

334
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,397
- We're looking for her husband, Mike.
- What the hell are you doing, Ev?

335
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,200
Wait, when was that?
No. No message.

336
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,270
Wait, when was that?
No. No message.

337
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,955
Let's switch to the exterior cameras.

338
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,918
Michael Krause left his office
at the Smithsonian an hour ago.

339
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,752
Salt's apartment is 20 minutes away.

340
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,797
We can cover it,
but she won't go there.

341
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,520
She will if she's serious about Mike.
This stays in-house.

342
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,159
Okay.

343
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,958
Taxi!

344
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,191
U Street. I'll tell you when to stop.

345
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,554
<i>Hi, this is Mik e. Please leave</i>
<i>a message after the tone.</i>

346
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,315
He's one of the world's
top arachnologists, Ev...

347
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,438
...and as such, enjoys pretty much
unrestricted access...

348
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,909
...to the borders of North Korea.

349
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,390
So brush up on your bugs
and get to know him.

350
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,713
<i>He's the perfect cover</i>
<i>to get us inside.</i>

351
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,273
Mike?

352
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,672
Mike? Honey?

353
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,671
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

354
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,717
It's all right.

355
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,957
It's okay. Where's Daddy?
Where's Daddy?

356
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,155
Come on. Come on.

357
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,190
Check for back exits.

358
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,958
Go! Go!

359
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,950
Bedroom, clear!

360
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,197
Kitchen is clear.

361
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,831
Office, clear!

362
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,635
Living room, clear!

363
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,271
Everybody out. Sixty seconds.

364
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,638
<i>Come</i> here.

365
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,113
What are you doing?

366
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,669
She's not here.
No sign of the husband either.

367
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,229
Did it ever occur to you that
that Russian was lying?

368
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,833
- Why'd she run?
- I don't know.

369
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,798
Because you were gonna lock her up?
See it from her perspective.

370
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,951
Maybe her husband
is in some real danger.

371
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,712
Maybe, God forbid,
Salt is who she says she is.

372
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,038
"Maybe" is your department.

373
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,760
Mine is catching her
so we can find out.

374
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,956
Protocol is clear. We bring her in
or we bring her down.

375
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,716
Do you have any idea
who this woman is?

376
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,792
What she's done for this country?
Does that mean anything to you?

377
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,109
Should it?

378
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,759
- Is your mom home?
- No.

379
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,433
- No? Can you do me a favour?
- Yeah.

380
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,670
Hi. You babysit Burt for me?

381
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,674
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah? Here's some money for food.

382
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,559
Hi, Burt.

383
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,358
What you doing?
You doing homework?

384
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,556
Yeah, math.

385
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,233
- Algebra.
- I hate math.

386
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,671
Hi. Nice to see you again.

387
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,832
- You talking to me?
- Yeah, I've seen you here before.

388
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,471
Yeah, l... Yeah, I come here a lot.

389
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,029
You?

390
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,714
Oh, I'm working here.
At the museum.

391
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,633
- I'm an arachnologist.
- A what?

392
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,711
A spider hunter.

393
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,992
You look like one.

394
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,759
There are 40,000 species of spiders
in the world.

395
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,318
And that one is mine.

396
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,469
You discovered it.

397
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,834
Inside North Korea.

398
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,275
I named it <i>Terrijoolsima peterbesti.</i>

399
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,395
Do you get that?

400
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,313
No. Should I?

401
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,040
<i>Peterbesti?</i> I named it
after Pete Best.

402
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,679
The first drummer before Ringo.

403
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,837
Best never was a famous Beatle...

404
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,436
...but now he's a famous spider.

405
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,035
I got her.

406
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,839
<i>She's heading north</i>
<i>towards the Metro station.</i>

407
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,515
Ev!

408
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,353
Ev!

409
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,395
She's eastbound,
in the Penn Quarter Mall.

410
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,593
Excuse me.

411
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,755
<i>- Will do. Headed there now.</i>
- There she is.

412
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,833
All teams, southbound
toward the bridge. Box her in.

413
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,269
Circle around!

414
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,118
Salt! Stop!

415
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,475
- Keep her in your sights!
- Coming up behind you!

416
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,959
Fuck!

417
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,711
Keep back! Hold your fire!

418
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,997
Salt! Down!

419
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,152
Salt!

420
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,639
Spread out!

421
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,716
- Salt!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot, I'm innocent!

422
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,916
- On the ground. Now!
- Please don't. No!

423
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,992
Down! Salt! Do it now!
On the ground!

424
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,309
I have to find my husband.

425
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,198
- Why'd you run?
- To find my husband!

426
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,078
- That's not a reason.
- Don't shoot.

427
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,559
- Stay back!
- Last chance.

428
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,109
I'm innocent.
Somebody is setting me up!

429
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,510
- Don't make me put you down.
- Put the gun down!

430
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,159
- Give yourself up!
- Come on, Ev.

431
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,749
Do what he says.
We'll sort this out, I promise.

432
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,032
I gotta bring you in, Salt.
It's over. Face down.

433
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,714
Somebody's going to try to
kill the Russian president.

434
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,519
Do something about that!
That's what you should worry about.

435
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,871
There's nowhere to run! Quit now!

436
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,314
No, I didn't do anything.

437
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:28,640
Get back! No!

438
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,789
Get back! No!

439
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,000
She's on a blue semi.
Route 1, heading north.

440
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,912
Get a roadblock in place now.

441
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,351
<i>Metro Police on alert.</i>

442
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,872
There she is. On the tanker.

443
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,476
Stop. Stop!

444
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,919
Ev!

445
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,475
You, my friend, have got
a mole in your group.

446
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,758
- We don't know that yet.
- I'd say she's a trained goddamn liar...

447
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,514
...and everything she's said
has been to protect her cover.

448
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,194
Well, why don't you tell me
how you really feel about it?

449
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,875
Get up on the shoulder!
Get up on the shoulder!

450
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,635
Okay, take it down.

451
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,989
Shit!

452
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,149
Shit!

453
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,469
Okay.

454
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,155
Ted, I know you're her friend...

455
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,671
...but we gotta drop a net
on New York.

456
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,793
- We gotta do it now.
- Let's go!

457
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,636
Notify the Secret Service
on Matveyev's detail.

458
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,837
Tell them Salt might be
coming their way.

459
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,114
And if she is,
Orlov may not be far behind either.

460
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,949
You seen this?

461
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,429
Salt spent time in Russia as a kid.

462
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,719
She was in a car accident with
her parents in '88. They both died.

463
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,993
They were teachers at the U.S. Embassy
for the American children of the staff.

464
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,514
That's why we put her on Russia
in the first place.

465
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,357
We need to get on a plane
to New York, tonight.

466
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,832
Send everything we've got on Orlov
to N.Y.P.D.

467
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,112
<i>And here in New York City,</i>
<i>security has been beefed up...</i>

468
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,794
<i>... and preparations are continuing</i>
<i>well into the night...</i>

469
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,918
<i>... for the funeral of</i>
<i>Vice President Maxwell Oates.</i>

470
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,310
<i>Among the dignitaries</i>
<i>attending the service...</i>

471
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,357
<i>... at St. Bartholomew's Church...</i>

472
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,437
<i>... is Russian president</i>
<i>Boris Matveyev...</i>

473
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,549
<i>... who arrived here in Manhattan</i>
<i>earlier this evening.</i>

474
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:54,475
<i>Public transportation will experience</i>
<i>delays, with subway closures and...</i>

475
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,432
Look at me.

476
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,070
If there was a way, I would kill them.

477
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,672
You shouldn't have come here.

478
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,274
What do you mean?
I don't understand.

479
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,990
Now they know who you are.

480
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,958
Who?

481
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,672
Evelyn.

482
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,592
Who?

483
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,756
I would accept anything about you...

484
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,592
...but I need to know.

485
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,718
So look at me. Look at me.

486
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,200
Just tell me, okay?

487
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,789
Just tell me.

488
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,872
I work...

489
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,673
I work for the CIA.

490
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,991
So you see, there's...

491
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,753
There's no future for us.

492
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,629
You're not safe with me.

493
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,990
I don't wanna be safe.

494
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,038
I know you...

495
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,756
...and I wanna be with you.

496
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,350
I want to spend the rest of my life
with you.

497
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,673
Okay?

498
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,316
Okay. Okay.

499
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:45,279
Welcome to New York, Miss Hernandez.
One night, a deluxe room.

500
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,472
Do you need any help
with your luggage?

501
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,755
Nope, I got it. Thanks.

502
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,268
- I'll put these in the closet, sir?
- Yeah, fine.

503
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,473
<i>I do solemnly swear...</i>

504
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,073
I do solemnly swear...

505
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,516
...that I will support and defend
the Constitution of the United States...

506
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,956
...that I will support and defend
the Constitution of the United States...

507
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,350
...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

508
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,193
...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

509
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,078
That I will faithfully discharge...

510
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,878
That I will faithfully discharge...

511
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,474
...the duties of the office
on which I'm about to enter.

512
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,559
...the duties of the office
on which I am about to enter.

513
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,871
- So help me God.
- So help me God.

514
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,793
A solemn day here in New York City.

515
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,758
The funeral of Vice President
Maxwell Oates...

516
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,469
...a former five-term U.S. Senator
and Cold War warrior...

517
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,915
...whose greatest legacy
may be as architect...

518
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:11,231
...of the new era
of Russian-American relations.

519
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,311
Russian president Boris Matveyev...

520
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,153
<i>... has journeyed from Moscow</i>
<i>to be an honorary pallbearer...</i>

521
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:20,108
<i>... to the man he's called</i>
<i>his greatest friend in the West.</i>

522
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,070
What's the security perimeter?

523
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,152
We're two deep inside
and we own this entire block.

524
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,517
And those are Secret Service agents,
not CIA.

525
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,990
- So relax.
- That's real funny.

526
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,590
Didn't know you guys told jokes.

527
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,469
Detail, halt.

528
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,710
Forward, march.

529
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:00,112
<i>Due to the funeral,</i>
<i>the 51 st Street station is closed.</i>

530
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:08,633
<i>Repeat: Due to the funeral,</i>
<i>the 51 st Street station is closed.</i>

531
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,799
What...? Hey, what's going on?

532
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,793
Hey! There's smoke.

533
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,872
Step back, step back.
Everybody, move out of the way.

534
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,155
Eleanor. Good to see you.

535
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,352
Thank you.

536
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,077
- Boris.
- Mr. President.

537
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,679
Hello.

538
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,356
Please be seated.

539
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:36,348
<i>Stand by for president's speech.</i>

540
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,278
<i>Patrolling church exterior.</i>
<i>No one in or out the side doors.</i>

541
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,915
Mrs. Oates.

542
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,876
Eleanor, Joe, Marissa, Donald...

543
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,953
After the president, the choir sings,
then Matveyev delivers the eulogy.

544
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,192
If your girl tries anything here,
it'd have to be pretty amazing.

545
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:05,797
I knew he would bring more to the job
than just his years of experience.

546
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,156
As vice president...

547
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:12,677
...he showed the world the best
of what it is to be an American.

548
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,388
And today...

549
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:19,111
...the world says goodbye
to a great man.

550
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,638
I'll check the back.

551
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,189
Lima Zulu 4, clear.

552
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,230
<i>My friendship with Maxwell Oates...</i>

553
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,278
...began in the unlikeliest of places:

554
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,796
<i>- Lima Zulu 4, come in.</i>
<i>- Across the negotiating table...</i>

555
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,030
<i>What's your status, Lima Zulu 4?</i>

556
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,349
We got two MIAs.

557
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:14,435
Lima Zulu 4 in the utility tunnel outside
the crypt entrance and Lima Zulu 5.

558
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,592
I'm heading down to the crypt.
Some kind of trouble down there.

559
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,318
What's going on, guys? Talk to me.

560
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,472
Subunits Lima Zulu 1, 2 and 3,
converge on the crypt. Repeat:

561
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,675
<i>Converge on the crypt.</i>

562
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,796
He made all the difference,
and for that...

563
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,636
...he will always have
my respect and admiration.

564
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,432
That is what my friend Maxwell Oates
would have said.

565
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,075
What's going on?

566
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,959
Matveyev.

567
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,915
Get goddamn Matveyev.

568
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,000
- Get the bomb squad in here!
- Go, go!

569
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,629
Drop it!

570
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,477
- Any MTs down here?
- I see her.

571
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,234
- Keep your hands up!
- Shooter's at 12 o'clock.

572
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,551
- Gun! She's got a gun. She has a gun!
- Don't move!

573
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,790
- Do not move! Do not move!
- Keep your hands up!

574
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,111
- Take her down, take her down!
- Check for other weapons.

575
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,350
We need a medical crew
in the crypt immediately.

576
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,272
I can't feel a pulse.

577
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,433
Jurisdiction is clear.
This is New York City.

578
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,955
N.Y.P.D. Has her.
She's going to 1 Police Plaza.

579
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,554
- I'm not arguing jurisdiction.
- We don't know yet, sir.

580
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,188
- The shooter is CIA. I know her.
- Yes, I'll be there.

581
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,759
I'll be on the next chopper out.

582
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,514
- Have your superior call the mayor.
- Open up, guy, open up.

583
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,000
Move it.

584
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,035
Move it.

585
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,633
Back it up! Back it up!

586
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,633
Come on, guys. Keep moving.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

587
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,949
Let's go, let's go.

588
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,078
Hey, watch this guy, watch this guy.

589
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,229
- Back up!
- Keep moving.

590
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,594
Sir, back up!

591
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,228
Why? Why?!

592
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,519
Do you have any idea
how much blood is on your hands?

593
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,193
You're gonna rot in a hole, Salt.

594
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,316
I'm gonna see to it personally!
A dark hole!

595
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,913
Get ahold of yourself.

596
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,993
Get the door, get the door.

597
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,720
- Get off me!
- Back off, man! Back off!

598
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,154
That's it. Let's go.

599
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,997
Stand back.

600
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,114
Close it! Go, go, go!

601
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:13,270
Matveyev was declared dead
en route to the hospital.

602
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,954
Jesus Christ.

603
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,475
Yeah.

604
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,716
You were right about her.

605
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,069
She had the drop on me, Ted.

606
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,032
Why didn't she shoot?

607
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,158
<i>Natasha.</i>

608
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,432
Natasha.

609
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,278
Is that you?

610
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,395
Did they give you a new face?

611
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:02,079
I'm going home tomorrow, Shnaider.

612
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,993
Home to Grozny?

613
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:08,233
My home is in Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania.

614
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:13,632
My favourite place there is McDonald's
on Fern Street...

615
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,036
...because it's near the river.

616
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,235
But I won't want to go there
anymore...

617
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,433
...because my mother and father
are dead.

618
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,234
Natasha...

619
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,478
...will you miss me?

620
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:32,559
My name is Evelyn Salt.

621
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,518
Cop down, cop down! Hear me!

622
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,473
Get out of the car
with your hands on your head!

623
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,353
Right now! Hands in the air!

624
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,235
- Hey, did you see that?
- Hey, get those guys over here.

625
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,072
Get them over here to help.

626
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,678
What college will you attend?

627
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,637
Princeton University.

628
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,712
- Where will you work?
- The Central Intelligence Agency.

629
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,836
Who will you trust?

630
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,638
No one.

631
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,075
Be very patient.

632
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,878
Remember your training.

633
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,872
Remember, you're not the only one.

634
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,598
There are many others.

635
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,911
All of you waiting to strike.

636
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,071
- Yes.
- And we will strike.

637
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,797
- Together.
- Yes.

638
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,719
Wait.

639
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:40,114
One day, I will come for all of you.

640
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,678
Hello, Evelyn.

641
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,037
I'm Martin Crenshaw
from the U.S. Embassy.

642
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,911
We're very sorry about
your family's accident.

643
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:05,395
<i>Rioters outside the U.S. Embassy</i>
<i>cheered their new leader's words...</i>

644
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,916
<i>... and called on him to tak</i> e <i>strong</i>
<i>action against what they are calling...</i>

645
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,756
<i>These riots are sparking</i>
<i>similar outbreaks...</i>

646
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:17,957
<i>... of anti-American protests</i>
<i>across Russia.</i>

647
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:21,157
<i>"We will strik</i> e <i>back,"</i>
<i>says the new Russian president...</i>

648
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,629
<i>... angrily condemning</i>
<i>today's assassination...</i>

649
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:27,110
<i>... by American intelligence officer</i>
<i>Evelyn Salt.</i>

650
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:31,116
<i>As the body of slain President Matveyev</i>
<i>is on its way back to Moscow...</i>

651
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,748
<i>... anti-American riots</i>
<i>have erupted across Russia...</i>

652
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,956
<i>... with bombings of U.S. Diplomats'</i>
<i>cars in Moscow.</i>

653
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,598
<i>The Russian armed forces</i>
<i>have been put on high alert.</i>

654
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,679
<i>Responding to</i>
<i>a rapidly escalating crisis...</i>

655
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,912
<i>... President Lewis has called for</i>
<i>an emergency White House meeting...</i>

656
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:50,356
<i>... with cabinet members, military</i>
<i>leaders and NATO representatives.</i>

657
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,318
Greetings, Comrade Chenkov!

658
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,038
When I saw you in Washington,
I almost ran to you.

659
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,754
You were not supposed
to get married.

660
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:16,152
Not unless it had
great tactical advantage.

661
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,958
I did it to seem normal.

662
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,671
When you escaped today, I thought:

663
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:24,833
"Even I could not have hoped
for so much."

664
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:28,710
You are my greatest creation.

665
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,910
You trained me well.

666
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,912
My husband, you have him?

667
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,355
I had to be certain.

668
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,511
But now you trust me?

669
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:15,669
Completely.

670
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,993
So...

671
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,316
...tell me what's next.

672
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,710
Next, part two:

673
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:34,034
We seize control of
this country's atomic weapons.

674
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,958
You'll see.

675
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,434
All right.

676
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,315
Are you ready to watch him die?

677
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:35,429
Give me the gun.

678
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,190
That would be too easy.

679
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,036
Satisfied?

680
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:40,629
I'm satisfied.

681
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,159
Comrades...

682
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:47,910
...our sister has rejoined us.

683
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:51,238
Russia will rise from the ashes...

684
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,710
...of the greatest war
the world has ever seen.

685
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,396
And the world will hear us!

686
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,155
Will hear.

687
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,792
Welcome back to our family, sister.

688
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,629
Sister.

689
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:22,192
Russia has changed.
But our lives will not be wasted.

690
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:28,316
You're to meet an agent,
NATO uniform, at a plane here.

691
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:34,232
Tail number N182SL.

692
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:39,558
Final instructions will come from him.

693
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,715
- That's it.
- That's it.

694
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:45,793
After this, we go dark.

695
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,470
Radio silent.

696
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,158
You won't hear from me again...

697
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,908
...my daughter.

698
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:15,878
Have you heard from Orlov?

699
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,876
Yes. Last word was "go."

700
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,549
Chenkov.

701
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,158
Do you remember me?

702
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,349
<i>Chenk ov.</i>

703
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,272
Did you miss me?

704
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:38,949
Shnaider?

705
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,548
How long have you been here?

706
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,759
I left Russia one year after you.
To Prague.

707
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,470
I've been the NATO liaison
to the White House for three years.

708
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,440
Colonel Edward Tomas.

709
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,797
And you are my attach.

710
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,552
Your ID.

711
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,430
Don't worry, we have plenty of time.

712
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,398
More importantly, our mission.

713
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:12,992
The bunker eight storeys
below the White House.

714
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,552
That's where the president
needs to be.

715
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:22,715
How do we do it?

716
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:26,793
Don't worry, he'll be there.
That's my job. I'll make sure he's there.

717
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,910
- What's my job?
- Do you remember, Chenkov...

718
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:34,675
...when we were young and you
had to finish first in everything?

719
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,512
Had to be the best at everything.

720
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:40,554
Though you knew you would be beaten
with a cane, you had to finish first.

721
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,233
I remember.

722
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,756
Tonight you will finish
ahead of me again.

723
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:52,478
Tonight you will kill
America's president.

724
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,552
IDs, please.

725
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,236
Pop the hood and open the trunk.

726
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,589
I'll check the side.

727
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,189
Control, this is Hayes.

728
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:18,113
I have a Colonel Tomas
and a Major Vicek.

729
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:19,554
Undercarriage is clean.

730
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:21,755
Back's clean.

731
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:26,192
Colonel. Major. All clear.

732
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,352
You know the drill, colonel.

733
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,708
Shrapnel. A Serbian landmine.

734
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,758
They've spent more time looking at it
than the doctor did.

735
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,156
Step through, please, sir.

736
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,035
Turn around.

737
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,918
Thank you.

738
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,879
- Step through. Arms out.
- Patience is key.

739
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,998
I've been coming here for two years,
others have been here longer.

740
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,390
- What others?
- I don't know.

741
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,597
But you were the best of us
and I was the least.

742
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,070
There must be others,
here to finish what we begin.

743
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:22,878
Colonel Tomas.
Good to see you again.

744
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,189
- Major Vicek.
- Pleasure.

745
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:27,158
You'll have minutes to preview NATO's
point of view before the meeting.

746
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,319
Now, Ted, your Russian
CI agent, Salt.

747
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,677
- What can you tell us about her?
- We think she may be a Soviet plant...

748
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:39,798
...inserted years ago in preparation
for something the KGB called Day X.

749
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:44,479
A day marking the start of a large
strike against the U.S. And her allies.

750
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,830
This should be the president now.

751
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,756
You have a big job, Chenkov...

752
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,148
...but you can do it.

753
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,550
You still haven't told me
what your job is.

754
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,512
Home.

755
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:06,353
I'm going home.

756
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,950
- Down! Take cover!
- Get the president!

757
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,471
- A gun! He's got a gun!
- Get back!

758
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:17,909
Get back!

759
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,195
- Are you okay, sir?
- Yes.

760
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,749
- Goddamn it.
- Geronimo is SOP, downward mobile.

761
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,355
Help, over here!

762
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,755
Get a medic! Get a medic!

763
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,516
I think I saw her.

764
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,478
You saw who?

765
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,593
Salt.

766
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:01,669
I think I saw her in the corridor.

767
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,119
The other NATO officer.

768
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:10,549
She's here.

769
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,115
Check.

770
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:14,599
- Clear.
- Move.

771
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,269
Go!

772
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,908
We may have a visual
on a second assailant. Evelyn Salt.

773
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:22,117
Repeat: Evelyn Salt on premises.
May be dressed as a NATO officer.

774
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:26,396
<i>This is not a drill.</i>
<i>The White House is under attack.</i>

775
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,269
<i>If you are near an exit, please</i>
<i>proceed outside in an orderly manner.</i>

776
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,158
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

777
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,870
I need this hallway cleared
to the left, now!

778
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:38,993
Command, this is Jenks. I need
the PEOC bunker up and running.

779
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,435
If this was authorised
by the Russian government...

780
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,034
...it is an act of war,
and we will respond.

781
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:49,239
<i>If you are near an exit, please</i>
<i>proceed outside in an orderly manner.</i>

782
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,231
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

783
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:52,992
- Clear!
- Let's go, sir.

784
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,113
Alpha team!

785
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:02,238
Move, move.

786
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,154
Close it.

787
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:05,754
Close it.

788
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:15,354
<i>Please proceed outside</i>
<i>in an orderly manner.</i>

789
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,511
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

790
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:48,673
Go, go.

791
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,954
Geronimo approaching bunker door
in five seconds.

792
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,839
Clear.

793
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,714
Any chance she could follow?

794
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,871
My own men couldn't
get through that door.

795
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,600
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
she isn't one of yours.

796
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:17,755
Okay, go.

797
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,112
Stay until it's shut and sealed.

798
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,757
Geronimo secured.

799
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:55,951
- Get me Director Medford.
- Yes, sir.

800
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,673
Sir, I think we need to
seriously consider the possibility...

801
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,593
...that today, right now,
could be the start of Day X.

802
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,669
Mr. President,
Director Medford is up.

803
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,313
Marion, what's the situation?

804
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:11,358
<i>It should be coming up</i>
<i>on one of your screens.</i>

805
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:14,075
<i>What you</i> see <i>there</i>
<i>represents temperature drops...</i>

806
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:16,310
<i>... in mobile missile units in Siberia.</i>

807
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,156
<i>It means the Russians are deploying</i>
<i>their missiles to the field.</i>

808
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:23,756
<i>And that's been confirmed</i>
<i>on the ground, Mr. President.</i>

809
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,236
Mr. President, I strongly recommend
we go from DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2.

810
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,709
At least at our forward bases.

811
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,389
Do it.

812
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,836
And since the Russians
have deployed...

813
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,592
...we need to look at
our own nuclear attack options.

814
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,719
It's not on the table,
it's not a deterrent.

815
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,595
Thanks, Marion.
We'll come back to you.

816
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:07,519
Sir.

817
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,392
The outer portal door is jammed.
No response.

818
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,199
And we just lost the feed
from most of our security cameras.

819
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,874
We're blind down here
and no one can enter this facility.

820
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:22,999
Command, our eyes are down. We have
a PEOC outer security door malfunction.

821
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,032
Get out there now.

822
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,997
Seal this room.

823
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,513
Down that corridor. Secure it.

824
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,320
<i>Victims are being tak en to</i>
<i>George Washington Hospital.</i>

825
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:20,359
<i>Reports are coming in that there</i>
<i>are casualties at the White House.</i>

826
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,472
This is President Howard Lewis.

827
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:27,315
<i>- Proceed with authentication.</i>
- Yes, Mr. President.

828
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:34,272
- Ready to commence authentication.
- Zulu.

829
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,475
- Tango.
- Echo.

830
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:36,675
- Seven.
- Niner.

831
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:37,875
- Juliett.
<i>- X-ray.</i>

832
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,075
<i>- Sierra.</i>
<i>- Seven.</i>

833
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,275
<i>- Alfa.</i>
- Mike.

834
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:41,919
- Charlie.
- Whisky.

835
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,069
<i>- Five.</i>
<i>- Six.</i>

836
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:46,198
<i>- Tango.</i>
<i>- Authentication codes confirmed.</i>

837
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,632
<i>It's all yours now, Mr. President.</i>

838
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,434
God be with you.

839
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:55,072
Attack options and targeting
under your control, Mr. President.

840
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:57,117
Anders and Nablo,
what's your location?

841
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,395
<i>Anders and Nablo,</i>
<i>what's your location?</i>

842
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,838
Is the camera outside
this door working? Put it up.

843
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:09,595
Officer Dryer, come in.

844
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:14,552
<i>Federal Communication Commission is</i>
<i>activating the Emergency Alert System.</i>

845
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,233
Who the hell's that?

846
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,759
That's her. That's Evelyn Salt.

847
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:21,029
She's in. Go to DEFCON 1.

848
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,113
Give me your side arm.

849
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:26,670
No, sir. Only Secret Service possess
firearms in the president's vicinity.

850
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,478
Screw protocol.
We got an enemy agent.

851
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,551
Protocol is protocol, sir.

852
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,599
And dead is dead.

853
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,638
Behind me!

854
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,672
I'm the national security advisor.

855
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,109
Not anymore.

856
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:48,669
Sit down.

857
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:52,909
Who are you?

858
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,273
My name, Mr. President,
is Nikolai Tarkovsky.

859
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,829
And unless you do exactly as I say...

860
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,469
...I will be the last person
you will ever see.

861
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:10,515
Shall we look at some
selective attack options?

862
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:11,949

01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:52,630
Congratulations, Comrade Chenkov.
You made it.

867
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,877
Why didn't you tell me?

868
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,429
I tried many times, but...

869
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,639
My loneliness was my only friend.

870
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,836
You weren't with us in Russia.
I would have remembered you.

871
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,677
I was a class ahead, comrade.

872
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:10,031
The brightest of any of Orlov's stars.

873
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,994
And now it's my honour
to launch the attack.

874
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,839
Excuse me.

<i>Mecca.</i>

Mecca? Tehran?

879
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,632
Part two of our plan.

880
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,677
Kill nine million people.

881
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:32,759
Enrage a billion Muslims.

882
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:35,631
America will suffer a painful death.

You know, when you first came
to Langley...

891
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,995
...I didn't think I'd be able
to do it.

892
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,957
I didn't think I'd be able to...

893
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:16,513
...resist the temptation
to say something.

894
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:19,393
Then you met Mike and...

895
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,279
...well...

896
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,631

Let me join you.

898
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:33,073
All these years right in front of me
and I never knew.

01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,074
Let me join you.

900
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,837
I want to be with you.

901

<i>The man we thought was dead has</i>

903
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,279
<i>We're going to Russia.</i>
<i>What you are seeing...</i>

904
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,789
<i>... are live pictures of</i>
<i>Russian president Matveyev...</i>

905
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:09,714
<i>... arriving at the airport outside</i>
<i>of Moscow. This is astonishing.</i>

906
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:12,952
<i>According to his doctors, President</i>
<i>Matveyev's mistak en death...</i>

907
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,350
<i>... is attributed to</i>
<i>a temporary paralysis...</i>

908
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,954
<i>... from a toxin</i>
<i>derived from spider venom.</i>

909

<i>... who may not have been</i>
<i>following the events of the day...</i>

911
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,196
At least I was right.

912
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:33,316
I had a feeling we'd lost you
back there in North Korea.

913
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:37,195
I could see how moved you were
by Mike's little white-knight routine.

914
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:39,430
You were supposed to
recruit him, Ev...

915
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,158
...not fall in love with him.

916
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:44,396
That's why I told Orlov
to pick him up.

917
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:49,636

933
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,312
- Get down!
- What is your name, sir?

934
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:56,677
I'm Theodore Winter, CIA.
Help the president.

935
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:59,917
Mr. President.

936
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:03,515
Mr. President, can you hear me?

937
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,633
- Hold still.
- EMT's on the way.

938
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,836
Make sure they got body bags.
At least seven.

939
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,479
She's wearing a vest.

940
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:13,508
I'll meet you in five minutes.
I wanna get cleaned up.

941
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,193
And I want her alone in a room.

942
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,749
If there are other KAs out there,
I want her talking.

943
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:21,390
She won't talk. She's trained not to,
no matter what we do to her.

944
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:23,949
If we're gonna find these people,
we gotta do it.

945
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,110
I'm gonna get cleaned up.
I'll be right back.

946
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:40,033
No one comes through until
the president is secure. Step back.

947
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,395
- I'm Theodore Winter...
- Step back, sir. Please.

948
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,229
Well, sir, you're injured.
Why don't you have a seat?

949
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,072
We'll take a look at you.

950
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:52,398
Are you okay?

951
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,475
Pretty good gash there.

952
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:58,108

in there.

955
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,751
Check him. Check him!

956
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,509
Checking vitals.

957
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:40,353
I'm not getting a pulse.
I'm not getting much.

01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,915
...one nation, under God...

The lily fold.

968
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:27,512
In my new life,
I'm trying to be less utilitarian.

969
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:37,159
Someone stopped the missile launch.

970
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:40,552
President was unconscious,
so it was either you or Winter.

971
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:44,315
President says Winter started it, so...

972
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,835
...you saved the world?

973
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:51,269
Listen, Salt.

974
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,271
Winter we can figure out.

975
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:58,113
He led a life. He left a trail.

976
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:02,398
We'll trace it back.
I will dissect him if I have to.

977
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,839
But Orlov is still out there.

978
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:11,473
Mike used to say the sweetest thing.

979
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:15,633
He used to say that his heart...

980
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:17,756
...was a spider web...

981
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:21,310
...and I was the spider
who lived on top.

982
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:27,358
And no matter where I was,
I could attach a single thread...

983
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:32,078
...so I would always be connected.

984
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:36,431
So I could always find my way home.

985
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,396
He told me
whenever I saw a spider web...

986
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:45,154
...I should remember
how much he loved me.

987
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:06,511
I did nothing.

988
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:12,229
They killed my husband and I watched
and I did nothing.

989
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:18,190
For the greater good.

990
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:25,238
I'm sorry about Mike, but Orlov...

991
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:29,432
- Give me something.
- Why?

992
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,390
So you can arrest him?

993
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:36,519
So your taxpayers can put him
in a pretty little box?

994
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,312
His real name is not Orlov.

995
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,752
What is it?

996
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:58,318
They gave us
these teeth in the back...

997
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:04,829
It's why I killed Winter.
So he couldn't do it himself.

998
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:07,915
Shit!

999
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:12,156
Goddamn cyanide.

1000
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,350
Yeah, it's Peabody.
Put me through straight away.

1001
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:19,360
Salt just tried to kill herself. Yeah.

1002
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:20,589
Could be cyanide.

1003
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:22,113
Keep her alive, folks.

1004
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:24,396
No, they're trying
to figure that out right now.

1005
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,513
Are her airways clear?

1006
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,834
Shit.

1007
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:40,273
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

1008
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:44,598
Freeze!

1009
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:55,073
Our father has decided that...

1010
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:57,310
...the time has come...

1011
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:00,836
...for you all to start your new lives.

1012
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,471
To prepare for our next attack.

1013
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:33,751
Can I help you?

1014
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,391
My daughter.

1015
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:48,589
Have you come to kiss the ring?

1016
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:55,552
I've come to tell you that I'm free.
