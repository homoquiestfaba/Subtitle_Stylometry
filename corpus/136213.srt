They're very diverting, both
magazines, but I still think
Vogue is the final word, Kitty.

161
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,995
- Oh, I think Vogue--
- I think you'll have to agree
with me there. I have to go.

162
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:32,331
- [All Arguing]
- This was fun.

163
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,297
I, uh, suppose you
don't remember me. Major Hamilton?

164
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:44,218
- Marshall Field's, Chicago.
Fashion director?
- Oh, yes.

165
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,804
It's good seeing you.
I have a little bit of time.
Would you like a quick interview?

166
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:50,641
[Kitty] Oh, we really don't do
unscheduled interviews.

167
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,643
[Hamilton] Oh, I don't mind.
I don't mind at all.

168
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,187
- Hey, Milo. Milo, one minute.
- [Groans]

169
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:57,689
- One minute. Hey. How are you?
- [Hamilton]
I'll be here if you need me.

170
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,691
- Kitty Potter? Kitty Potter.
- How're you doin'? Yeah.

171
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:03,737
We ready? We rollin'?
This is Milo O'Brannigan...

172
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:07,366
the most sought-after fashion
photographer in the business today.

173
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:12,538
Milo, you've had a lock on the look
of the '90s for decades now.

174
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:15,707
Um, how have you managed to stay
on top of everything?

175
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:19,127
Probably the same way
you have, Kitty.

176
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:22,631
Just hard work and believin'
in yourself, right?

177
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:27,386
Mmm. Taking advantage of
other people's insecurities.

178
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:30,430
[Simone] Anyway, we'll
show it to Pilar.

179
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,766
[Fiona] So, does your mother
believe in the old adage...

180
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:36,144
that some women dress for men,
but most women dress for other women?

181
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:39,106
You know, my mother makes dresses
to celebrate a woman's body.

182
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:42,526
Dressing for men has never
particularly interested her...

183
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:44,528
although she's certainly
undressed for a few of them.

184
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:48,907
No. You know, the main
difference between men and
women in fashion is this:

185
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:53,120
Women make dresses for themselves
and for other women;

186
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:57,875
a man.... makes clothes
for a woman he wants to be with...

187
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,460
- or, as in most cases,
for the woman he wants to be.
- Mm-hmm.

188
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,046
- [Chuckles]
- Are you married?

189
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:06,300
Mm-hmm. I'm married to Dane.
Come over here, honey.

190
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,429
Okay.

191
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:12,890
Dane, whoo-hoo.
Earth to Dane.

192
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,434
Jack, try and be
a little bit nice.

193
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:20,439
This is my wife, Dane.
These are her famous legs, and
this is her famous sister, Kiki.

194
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:22,733
- Hello. Fiona.
- Hey, how's it going? Hey, Fiona.

195
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,986
- Hi, I'm Dane.
- They share the same father, at least
that's what their agent tells us.

196
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:30,532
I made these clothes for your
old body, and now you couldn't
fit into them if I asked you to.

197
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,743
- Cy! Cy, it was not her fault.
- Am I crazy? Am I crazy, or what?

198
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,330
What of a "fault"? It's not a fault, you
faggot! You woman-haters! It's great!

199
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:38,832
- It's a big shock!
- Albertine, you could've
called me, right?

200
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,919
- I was in Germany.
- You could've called me.
Oh, oh, I am crazy, I am crazy!

201
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:44,505
Or did the goddamn Germans
invent the telephone?

202
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:48,759
They invented worse, okay? I wasn't
really sure I was going to keep it.

203
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:51,637
Look, you gotta be eight
and a half months pregnant.

204
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,973
I mean, if I was Lacroix
or was that thief Lagerfeld,
you would've called me, right?

205
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,478
- We'll get Eve; they are the same size.
- I hate her fucking tattooed head.

206
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:01,396
- You're bald!
- Aren't I.

207
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:03,607
Uh-- [Snaps Fingers]
Violetta.

208
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:06,151
- Yes.
- I can't deal with this girl.

209
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,904
- Well, I'll get rid of her.
- Albertine. Albertine's the one I want.

210
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:12,407
- Why can't I have Albertine?
- Albertine is pregnant.
The agency said she was pregnant.

211
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:14,743
Pregnant is not my silhouette
this season!

212
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,121
- Oh, I know.
- I mean, it is not.
It is not, it is not!

213
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:23,293
My bulge is in the bustle out
at the back, not in the bulge up front.

214
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,172
Bald tattoo is not part
of my vision. It's beyond deja vu.

215
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:31,927
- [Shutter Clicking]
- [Woman] We're freezing out here!

233
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:44,852
- What? Are you joking?
- [Simone] Pilar, the two
greys, it's not good, you know.

234
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:48,313
- [Jack] Get me Ricardo Bonet...
- Hold on, please. Simone.

235
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,899
- Why is there no music today here?
- [Pilar] S'il vous plait.

236
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:53,735
- Simone, it's important.
- Okay, I'm coming.

237
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:57,072
- Please.
- Oh, your smoke, Pilar.
You're killing us.

00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:02,995
Oui, c'est moi.

240
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:07,541
- Murdered?
- Jack!

241
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,377
Put on the news.

00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,047

C'est pas possible. He was here.

244
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:19,428

What? What? What?

246
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:25,893
- [Woman] When did this happen?
- What happened?

247
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:29,605

258
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:40,467
This is a shocking prelude to
the spring pret-a-porter collections...

259
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:43,512
the glittering spectacle
Olivier de la Fontaine choreographed...

260
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,806
each season
for a cast of thousands.

261
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:50,686
It's, uh--
It's this-- this one.

262
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:57,651
- You took photographs?
Can I have the roll?
- Oui. Yes.

Okay. You give your--
You give your name.

He jumped off the bridge,
just like that. He just jumped off.

265
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:09,746
- Totally bizarre. Completely strange.
- I-I saw the whole thing.

266
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:11,874
Il est ou le chauffeur?

267
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:18,672
- Could you identify the guy?
- All white people look alike to me.

268
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:22,301
All right. How can you tell
him apart from your boss, if it's true?

269
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:25,846
By his clothes, how do you think?
That's how I tell everybody apart.

and 20 minutes.

00:22:57,211 --> 00:22:59,713
You're not telling me I have to
wait an hour and 20 minutes, are you?

for you from Washington.

Am I invisible? I've been standing here
for a half an hour!

00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:39,169
- You can use the phone
on the desk right there.
- All right.

Hello?

so very much...

292

- since you've, uh, retired from Vogue.
- Really?

293

I'm a sports reporter, for Christ's
sake! I don't know dick about fashion.

Oh, for God's sake! I gotta leave
Paris. You gotta use the fuckin' wire.

- [Editor] This is a big story.
- What's so special about this dead guy?

297

What's his name?
The dead guy!

298

- No, I'm not checking out.
I'm not leaving. I'm staying.

another room, I'm sorry.

understand. This is my room.

- You don't understand
the day that I've had.

- I've lost my luggage--
- You don't understand!
I haven't checked out!

00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:45,986
- See, I have not checked out!
- I'm covering the fashion--

309
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:50,908
Well, do we have any fashion plans
or projects in the wings anywhere?

the surprise of my life there.

You know, I know a lot
about fashion, and we all know
that short skirts are back.

381
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:21,845
And short skirts are gonna be back
for the rest of the '90s, that's my bet.

I saw A-line skirts;

I saw sarong skirts.

the pouf skirt emerged.

want to be in the Salome Suite.

- The wrong suite.

Clint Lammeraux to you.

Clint is a gigantic fan
of yours.

the same way we think of longhorns.

Your shoes.
Is that new?

that my ideal woman...

has a bust,
waist and hips...

of her shoulders.

are very fresh again.

I think there is a lot
of different kind of beauty.

952
01:07:36,557 --> 01:07:39,893
And it's exactly what I try to show
in my different collection.

953
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:43,689
You know that there is different people
coming from, uh, different parts...

954
01:07:43,856 --> 01:07:47,693
that has not the profile, Greek
profile or something like that,
but can be beautiful.

955
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:50,696
And I try to show, like,
a kind of, uh, tolerance...

956
01:07:50,863 --> 01:07:54,408
where is that, uh, uh, you know, uh,
to be different, you can be...

957
01:07:54,575 --> 01:07:57,786
and to be proud about it,
and to-- to live like that.

958
01:07:57,953 --> 01:08:02,207
Well, you heard it here from the
wizard of our Oz, Jean-Paul Gaultier.

959
01:08:02,374 --> 01:08:04,209
And I'm Kitty Potter
with FAD.

960
01:08:04,376 --> 01:08:06,545
[Car Horn Honking]

961
01:08:06,712 --> 01:08:09,006
[Milo]
So, I got your note.

962
01:08:09,173 --> 01:08:11,550
Well, I sort of had to
resort to that, you know.

963
01:08:11,717 --> 01:08:15,012
You're so h-hard to get to with
all those people around you.

964
01:08:15,179 --> 01:08:17,222
Would you like cream or milk
with your tea?

965
01:08:17,389 --> 01:08:19,224
No, I don't like tea.

966
01:08:19,391 --> 01:08:22,269
Oh. Well, that's fine.

967
01:08:22,436 --> 01:08:25,481
We can just
get right to the point, Milo.

968
01:08:25,647 --> 01:08:28,859
May I call you Milo,
Mr O'Brannigan?

969
01:08:29,026 --> 01:08:30,944
Oh, sure.
Love the way you say it.

970
01:08:31,111 --> 01:08:33,822
Sounds just me old mother.

971
01:08:33,989 --> 01:08:35,824
Warms the cockles
of my heart.

972
01:08:35,991 --> 01:08:38,785
You know what I want
to talk about, don't you?

973
01:08:38,952 --> 01:08:42,664
I haven't the foggiest,
but I love surprises.

974
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:46,126
And I love your work.

975
01:08:46,293 --> 01:08:48,837
I want you to sign with Elle.

976
01:08:49,004 --> 01:08:54,092
I'll get you everything you want.
I'd stake my job on it.

977
01:08:54,259 --> 01:08:56,929
- Would you, now?
- Yes.

978
01:08:57,095 --> 01:08:59,431
I would.
And more than that!

979
01:08:59,598 --> 01:09:02,476
What could be more than that,
Miss Krumm?

980
01:09:02,643 --> 01:09:05,729
Well, let's see.
Ah, I would, uh...

981
01:09:07,648 --> 01:09:12,402
get down on my hands and knees,
if I thought it would help.

982
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:15,906
Ah, you never know,
it might help.

983
01:09:16,073 --> 01:09:17,950
[Laughs]

984
01:09:19,618 --> 01:09:21,453
I beg your pardon?

985
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:25,082
Well, you said, would it help
if you got down on your hands and knees?

986
01:09:25,249 --> 01:09:28,293
And I said,
"Well, you never know, might help."

987
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:30,295
