1
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,600
WITH/IN

2
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,759
VOLUME 1

3
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:51,599
STOP. REALLY. STOP.
LEAVE ALL DELIVERIES HERE!

4
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,879
Lucy?

5
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,919
Hi. How are you?

6
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,599
Hi, Dr. Gordon.

7
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,960
This is so weird.
You're there, I'm here.

8
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,120
How do we do this?
How do we start?

9
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,479
Just like we always do
when you were in my office,

10
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,800
except you hid the camera
on the bottom left of your screen.

11
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,240
Do you have to see me?

12
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,759
Well, since we haven't talked in a while,
I think it's important that.

13
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,879
I have some
visual contact with you.

14
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,800
We can go to normal phone sessions
in the future.

15
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,000
Patients have been worried
about their hair looking different.

16
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,599
No, it's not that. I look great.
I'm so rested.

17
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,879
YOUR ORDER HAS BEEN DELIVERED
BY ROBERT. ENJOY!

18
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,919
-I'm glad you're sleeping.
-Thank you.

19
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,960
So uh, let's turn the camera on.

20
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,560
Fortunately, it has also
given me some anxiety,

21
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:42,080
like with this call,
like what if your house is ugly,

22
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,840
that would be very triggering
for me.

23
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,479
-You've seen my office.
-I have.

24
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,919
And I have been wanting
to talk to you about that.

25
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,120
I feel like the color of the walls and
the couch are fighting each other.

26
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,240
Why don't we take a breath,

27
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,800
close your eyes,
picture an endless body of water,

28
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,759
put your mouse
on the video prompt,

29
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,399
and click when you're ready?

30
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,680
-How are you?
-No, how are you?

31
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:29,680
-With COVID? I'm fine.
-No, with being black.

32
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:37,240
Sorry, with being African American
with the Black Lives Matter.

33
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:40,160
Well, it's a painful time.

34
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,199
But it's always been painful.
I mean, these murders aren't new.

35
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,879
But the public concern is.

36
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,959
Our pain is becoming
a shared pain.

37
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,720
There's a sense of relief,
you know, in that

38
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,319
and a sense of hope, that maybe there
will be some real and lasting change.

39
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,319
I take responsibility

40
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,959
and I am so sorry
that racism even exists.

41
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,720
-Can I say that?
-Yes. Of course.

42
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,399
It's disgusting.
And I feel guilty.

43
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,399
I really do.

44
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,360
And what else?
What can I do?

45
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,800
Well, you could commit to learning
about the true history of racism.

46
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,199
-That's a start.
-I did. Yeah.

47
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,079
I've done that.

48
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:37,279
I've been reading James Baldwin
and I've watched that...

49
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,600
the documentary on,
I don't...

50
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,560
Frederick Douglass.
So good.

51
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:50,120
That's a great beginning.
Frederick Douglass is...

52
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,720
Shall we start now?

53
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,279
Sure.
Yes, yes, of course, of course.

54
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,199
So, how are you?

55
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,639
Well, I have found this pandemic
very validating,

56
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,360
which has been incredible
for my self-esteem.

57
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,439
Tell me about that.

58
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,759
This is my time.

59
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,600
-Can you elaborate?
-I'm right, finally.

60
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,319
Well, I have always been right.

61
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,360
The world is full of dangerous germs
and if we get near them, we die.

62
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,160
And that is so liberating.

63
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,639
There's a lot to unpack
in what you just said.

64
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,560
So what I'm hearing is, in a way
the world is walking in your shoes now?

65
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:54,480
Yes, yes.
Exactly.

66
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,399
I have been washing my hands
30 times a day

67
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,839
and socially distancing
my entire life.

68
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,079
Friends are calling me
for advice.

69
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,480
It sounds as
if there is a feeling of relief

70
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,480
as well as a sense of belonging
to your own life.

71
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,600
-That's very powerful, Lucy.
-I feel like I could start dating.

72
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,319
I am always avoiding touching people,
even people I want to touch.

73
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,240
And now,
that is socially acceptable.

74
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,560
So the reality of COVID,
along with your OCD,

75
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,920
has helped you manage
your response to it.

76
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,000
Is that a dog?
Have you got a dog?

77
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,120
I really don't like dogs.

78
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:41,240
-Dr. Gordon, have you got a dog?
-No...

79
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,720
-They lick their butt and lick your face.
-No...

80
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,360
-And they've got worms...
-No.

81
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,199
-And parvo.
-I don't have any pets, but...

82
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,680
And they get ear infections.

83
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,399
For the record, humans can't catch
any diseases from a dog.

84
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,160
Can't you get COVID from a dog?

85
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,279
There have been no confirmed cases
of pets carrying COVID

86
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,360
according to the American Veterinary
Medical Association.

87
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,360
Right. No confirmed cases.

88
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,480
What about the cases
that haven't been confirmed?

89
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,079
-It's on their website.
-This is my worst fear.

90
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,680
Experts giving me advice
that I can't trust.

91
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,680
Let's talk about that.
Tell me about that.

92
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:27,120
The only voice I can trust
is the one inside me.

93
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,399
And the first time ever,

94
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,039
it's not broken.

95
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,679
Let's stay with that
for a moment.

96
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:49,399
This feeling that the world has finally
caught up to who you are,

97
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,240
and it's helping you
find your place.

98
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,159
Yeah.

99
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,879
Please can you make it stop?

100
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,480
I can't even hear my voice
and you can make it stop.

101
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,679
I can't make it stop, but what if we
do some deep breathing together?

102
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,240
We think of the barking
as a calming sound.

103
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,159
Let's just change our emotional
frame of reference to it, okay?

104
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:21,000
And breathe in.
One.

105
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,039
Breathe in...

106
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,519
and out.

107
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:39,000
Good job, Lucy.
Good job.

108
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,559
"Dear Chinese chicken salad dressing
on the side,

109
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,320
chicken on the side,
lettuce on the side.

110
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,000
I've delivered food
to your house several times

111
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,000
and noticed
you have an enclosed yard

112
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,320
and always added tip on the app

113
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,480
even when I was late
or messed up your order.

114
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,440
Thank you for that."

115
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,559
"I can no longer afford to stay in LA
under these circumstances.

116
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,919
So I'm going back to where I came from
to live in an apartment with my parents."

117
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,480
"But it doesn't allow pets.

118
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,960
So I'm taking a leap of faith,
putting my trust

119
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:17,159
in the right person who will do
the right thing for my Nala.

120
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,279
She's a sweet girl, soulful,
and so smart.

121
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,879
Please be the person
I believe you to be.

122
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:32,879
Please be the person
I need you to be." Me?

123
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:36,320
Oh no!

124
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,960
This is... this is not...

125
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:52,360
No.
Why? Why me?

126
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,559
Why me? This is really
pushing all my buttons.

127
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,480
This is too much.

128
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,799
I am in control of my thoughts.

129
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:09,960
I am in control of my emotions.

130
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:12,039
I am in control of my thoughts.

131
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,559
I am in control of my emotions.

132
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,000
I am in control of my thoughts.

133
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,559
Stop. Wait, wait, wait.
Stay right there.

134
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,919
Hi, Nala.

135
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,240
I'm Beth.

136
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,200
Do you bite?

137
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,600
'Cause that would be
a deal breaker.

138
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,360
He said you were sweet.

139
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:01,600
I've always wanted a dog,

140
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,840
but I've never allowed myself
to have one,

141
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,879
although everyone I've ever known
has highly recommended

142
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,720
my making
this kind of commitment.

143
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,080
I have work.

144
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,000
I have patients
that really need me right now.

145
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,159
Could you please keep it down
for a moment?

146
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,000
That's my next patient
and he can be kind of demanding.

147
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,159
We don't know
when it's gonna go back.

148
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,480
My job is to help you feel safe
with the uncertainty of that.

149
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:41,519
No, it's my neighbor's dog.

150
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,600
Nala.

151
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,039
Of course, you have my full attention.
Yes, Donald.

152
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:55,440
Yeah, you're going into...
you're going into panic.

153
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:00,120
Let's get you back in focus,
okay?

154
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,360
And let's use your senses.

155
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,000
Okay, all right.
Tell me one thing you can touch.

156
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,039
Your phone.

157
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,159
Right, okay.
Yes.

158
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,879
And one thing you can smell.

159
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,399
Oh, okay.

160
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,080
And one thing you can taste.

161
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,600
Do you have some water there?

162
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,759
Okay, take a sip.

163
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:42,840
Good, Donald.
All right. Okay.

164
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,879
Now breathe in.

165
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,080
Hi, Nala.

166
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,639
That was one.

167
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,639
That was two.

168
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,840
That was three.

169
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,600
I can't do this.

170
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,399
I understand.
Karen, yes.

171
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,919
FaceTime her, 15 to 20 times in a row.
Short calls.

172
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,159
The more you're exposed to the fact that
she's healthy and wants to engage,

173
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,440
it will help open new neural pathways
for the both of you.

174
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,879
I don't have room
for this in my life.

175
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,000
Yes, I live alone.

176
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,879
I work from home.

177
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:54,600
But I can't split my focus.
I don't have time.

178
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,840
Hawthorne Shelter's reopened.

179
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:03,960
Wait, it says here Hawthorne
is a high kill shelter.

180
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,720
How many pounds is she?

181
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,919
She's not gonna fit in a purse,
if that's what you mean.

182
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:19,200
She resembles
a pit bull with short legs.

183
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,919
Big dogs get put down first?

184
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,799
Why? That's just wrong.

185
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,960
What if I donate money for her to stay
until she's adopted?

186
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,720
Who is they?

187
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:36,720
It's ultimately up to me.

188
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,840
Why does everyone think
I have the answer?

189
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:44,279
Why is it always up to me
to figure out what's right?

190
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,279
Hello?

191
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:55,559
Hi, Nala.

192
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,320
Can you sit?

193
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,120
Not bad.
Can you fetch?

194
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,880
Good job.
Oh, good job.

195
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:09,960
It's not your germs that worry me,
because people with animals

196
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:13,480
tend to have stronger immune systems
for a host of reasons.

197
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,000
Happiness Quotient.
Exercise level.

198
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,680
Being exposed to more germs helps
the body more easily fight them off.

199
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:31,400
I know what it's like to be pre-judged
for what you look like,

200
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:37,240
to provoke a response when you're doing
nothing, because people live in fear.

201
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:41,759
They have these prejudices
they don't even understand.

202
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,680
The hardest part
for my clients with OCD

203
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,240
is once they master
the fear of one thing,

204
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,720
their fear often
transfers to something else.

205
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,799
I feel their pain,

206
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:01,119
because it ties into my own
OCD and panic issues.

207
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,960
But of course,
I can't tell them that.

208
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,640
I can't tell them anything
that personal, you know?

209
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,839
So COVID has been easy for me.

210
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,640
It's been a relief
not to go out.

211
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:24,240
My whole life has been about keeping
a safe distance from people,

212
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,599
because I've been
easily misunderstood, you know?

213
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,400
Because to be really honest,
Nala,

214
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:39,559
I'm afraid
if they knew all of me...

215
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,039
...they might not love me.

216
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,359
I think we're making progress.

217
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,759
WEEK ONE

218
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,400
What the fuck
is she FaceTiming me for?

219
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,359
Shit.

220
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,799
Fucking chicken.

221
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,880
Okay.

222
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,960
All right.

223
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:46,000
-Hey.
-Hey.

224
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,200
You did your hair?
Why?

225
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,720
-Where the fuck you going?
-Oh, shut up.

226
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:53,920
And why the hell
you wearing a hat in the house?

227
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,680
I was on a call. I told you.

228
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,480
Anyway, what's up?

229
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,039
I'm trying to find the strength
not to kill my husband.

230
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,400
But it's... you go, what's up with you?
How are you?

231
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,839
I'm all right.
You know, just trying to stay busy.

232
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,200
Been writing, exercising.
Have you been exercising?

233
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,440
Really?

234
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,240
Gigi, come on.

235
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:17,359
I'm sorry. I know you don't exercise.
So I thought I would ask.

236
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,599
Maybe you're trying to take advantage
of the situation and be healthy.

237
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,440
-Oh, shut up.
-You shut up.

238
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,559
Oh, what the... shit.

239
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,279
The numbers just went up again.

240
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:31,480
I know. I saw the news this morning.
It's horrible.

241
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,359
God, I'm telling you,
this shit is scaring the shit out of me.

242
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,200
The end is coming
and my husband,

243
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:38,799
he's over there watching
that stupid news channel

244
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,759
and he's still convinced
that it's a hoax.

245
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:43,559
-Every day he's in my ear, talking shit.
-Well, it's not a hoax.

246
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,119
I know that, okay?
Please don't stress me out.

247
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,039
Coco, I'm telling you right now,

248
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,480
God's wrath is coming down
upon us, okay?

249
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:54,079
Just like the Bible says, there will be
fires, there will be floods...

250
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,640
And more destruction
and the world's going to end.

251
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,599
Gigi, they've been preaching
the same shit

252
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,079
during every world crisis since
the Spanish Flu to Y2K and now this.

253
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,799
You want to let me finish a sentence?
Because you're really annoying.

254
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,240
I'm not try...
Okay, you know what, I'm sorry.

255
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:10,079
I've been cooped up in this house alone
for a week and a half,

256
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,160
with no one to talk to,
so cut me some slack.

257
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,960
Well, I thought you said you were just
on the phone with someone?

258
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:18,200
-Well, you know what I mean.
-Well, I called you.

259
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:20,599
I called you yesterday.
I called you the day before yesterday.

260
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,960
And you didn't call me back.

261
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:24,640
And please don't tell me it's because you
were busy, 'cause I know your ass wasn't.

262
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,359
-I was.
-Yeah, what? Doing what?

263
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,400
Coloring in those grays?

264
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,680
I just did mine this morning.

265
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,440
-Did you get Botox?
-No.

266
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:51,039
Who the hell is looking at
your big-ass forehead right now?

267
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:53,119
For your husband
who's not even there?

268
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,200
Me, and maybe
a couple of other girls?

269
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,079
You know, the world
is coming to an end.

270
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,119
And you're worried
about your forehead.

271
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,680
And you need to get yourself some Botox
too, whenever this shit is over.

272
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:06,200
And you need to take care of that
moustache that's growing. It's hideous.

273
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,240
You know, it's 11:00
in the morning?

274
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,200
And? I bet you a lot of other people
are pouring right now, too.

275
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,960
This shit is too crazy
not to get drunk before noon.

276
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:22,960
-You really need to start praying.
-I pray every day.

277
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,000
As I thank the Lord
for these fermented grapes.

278
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:29,839
Gigi, relax.

279
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,000
Jesus drank wine, too,
during a time of crisis. So it's okay.

280
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,599
-What?
-The Last Supper?

281
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:39,160
How the hell do you think
he got up on that cross?

282
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,000
Coco, blasphemy.

283
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,920
That's at least a week in hell.

284
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,960
And he should have
smoked a fatty, too.

285
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:51,680
Speaking of...

286
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:53,880
Look at that.

287
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,480
Yup.

288
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,200
-Seriously, Coco?
-It's just weed.

289
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,640
-God's own green grass.
-At least a month and half. A month.

290
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,079
Oh shit.
He's back now.

291
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,960
And I didn't even get
to tell you why I called you.

292
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,799
Girl, all of a sudden,
he wants to start fucking again.

293
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:15,880
-No jodas. You poor thing.
-I know.

294
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:18,920
But you know what? At least,
it only lasts five or ten minutes tops.

295
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,599
Don't say anything.

296
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:27,240
You're so lucky that you still
like having sex with John.

297
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:29,519
I know, it's hard
not having him there with you.

298
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:31,440
But, girl, at least
he's not driving you crazy

299
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:34,000
like every other woman's husband
is doing right now.

300
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:37,119
I got to go. He's here. I got to go.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

301
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,839
Okay, bye.

302
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,920
WEEK THREE

303
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,400
Shit!

304
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,359
Oh my God! You look like a hot mess
and I'm a fat fucking pig.

305
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,680
Coco, I really... Shut the fuck up.
I didn't call for this.

306
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,559
What's wrong?

307
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,400
Oh God!
Just I started drinking again.

308
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,039
Why?

309
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,160
Because that's
all we do is fight.

310
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,039
That's all that happens,
is what we do is fight.

311
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:54,400
So what else is new?

312
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,759
I'm having a fucking
nervous breakdown right now.

313
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:59,359
And I could do without
your sarcasm.

314
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:06,880
I'm sorry, I'm drunk.

315
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,559
You okay?

316
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:18,200
-No. I hit him.
-Who? Julio?

317
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:20,680
No jodas.

318
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,000
I told him.
I couldn't take it anymore.

319
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:25,119
And if he continued to watch
that Tucker Carlson

320
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,519
and if he didn't change the channel,
I was gonna beat the shit out of him.

321
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:30,599
And he laughed, so I hit him.
And there was blood everywhere.

322
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,200
And I mean, thank God
that the swelling went down.

323
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,640
-Oh my God!
-Oh my God, I know...

324
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,720
I'm gonna call you tomorrow,
because I can't even take it today.

325
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,119
Oh, no, no, no, no,
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Gigi.

326
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,440
I'm drunk, too. I'm sorry.
Don't hang up.

327
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,880
So what you get drunk on,
Henny?

328
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:56,440
No, you ass. It wasn't Henny, it was gin.
And I'm going to hell.

329
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,480
No, you're not.
Because there is no hell.

330
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,279
Okay.
You die, and that's it.

331
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,680
Jail, maybe. Especially with your temper.
You really shouldn't be drinking...

332
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:10,400
I don't want to hear you go into a tizzy
about this, about me drinking, please.

333
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,519
I had to drink,
because if not I'm gonna kill this guy,

334
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:15,920
I'm gonna kill this man.
I love him. I love my husband.

335
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,319
But I do not like him.
And I don't like him right now.

336
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:21,599
And you are lucky
that you love and you like John.

337
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,319
Right?

338
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,119
Yes.

339
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:32,240
Yes, yes,
I love and like John.

340
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,599
It's just this distance
is getting to me.

341
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:37,200
I called him this morning,
and he said...

342
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,400
It doesn't even matter.

343
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:43,839
He doesn't even seem bothered,
and I'm like fucking losing it.

344
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,000
Trust me. Trust me.
John is going through it, too.

345
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,519
Don't worry.
This is gonna pass eventually.

346
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,839
I thought you said
the world was ending.

347
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,759
Yeah, I said a lot of things.

348
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,680
The question is,
do I really believe it?

349
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:01,839
Or maybe it's the gin talking.
I don't know.

350
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,279
Either way, I'm tired
and I'm gonna pass out.

351
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:07,200
-I'm gonna go to sleep, okay? Bye.
-No, no, no. Wait.

352
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,000
WEEK FIVE

353
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:55,960
Hey.

354
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,799
Julio's downstairs
in the living room.

355
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,119
And he doesn't know about
my little friend here.

356
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,480
Oh my God.
It's getting bad.

357
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,480
And you know what? I've got
my little friend right here, too.

358
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:11,680
Oh my goodness.

359
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,319
You saw the news today?

360
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,920
Yeah.

361
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,599
John called.

362
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,559
He said he thinks he should stay away
for another week, so...

363
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,440
You know
how I've always been jealous

364
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:39,920
of the love that you and John
have for each other?

365
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:44,599
-Why?
-Because I was and am stupid.

366
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,160
You remember the time that we were all
sitting around your house in Connecticut,

367
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,680
and we were going around,

368
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:54,400
everybody had to say what they would miss
if they never had it again?

369
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,720
And your John said, "I can't imagine
my life without this woman.

370
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:02,519
The thought of losing her
scares the shit out of me,

371
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:04,599
because I love her so much."

372
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,160
And then I said,
"You guys are pathetic cornballs."

373
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,559
Remember?

374
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,880
Yes, I know I remember.
'Cause Julio followed that up with,

375
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,519
he misses playing Call of Duty.

376
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,160
Oh no, honey. That was supposed
to make you laugh, not cry.

377
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,799
No, I'm sorry. It's just...

378
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:25,240
I keep getting
these panic attacks, you know?

379
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:28,680
Like, I'm here all by myself,
like what if I die by myself?

380
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:32,039
You know, and then it's like,
what if you're right?

381
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:34,400
-What if this is the end?
-Have another drink with me.

382
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:38,119
You don't have another drink...
light one of your joints.

383
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,359
Oh God!
What the hell is happening to you?

384
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:43,599
I don't know.

385
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:48,640
It's all right.

386
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,200
You know, I really should stop.

387
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:58,799
I mean, not the weed,
but you know, it's the liquor.

388
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,680
This is truly the devil's water,
you know? It really is.

389
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:07,079
But you know,
I was just...

390
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,720
You know, I was thinking
this morning that

391
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,920
maybe if I believed in God
like you,

392
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,160
maybe I would have some hope and I
wouldn't be so fucked up and worried.

393
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,400
Believing doesn't miraculously
wipe away all your shortcomings.

394
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,759
Trust me on that one.

395
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,119
And you know that you do this.

396
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,480
You did this every time
Daddy went away for work,

397
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,720
'cause you were
Daddy's little girl.

398
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,920
Yeah, well, at least
you were his best friend.

399
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,039
I was always so jealous of that
that you two had that.

400
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,000
You were jealous of me?
And I was jealous of you?

401
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,759
Spoopy.

402
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,559
He's gonna be home
in a week, all right?

403
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,519
Everything's gonna be okay.
Don't worry.

404
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,519
Having a hot flash over here.

405
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:07,039
What?

406
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,960
-Put it back on.
-Shut up.

407
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,200
You shut up, because I bet you
if you take that hat off,

408
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,519
you're gonna look
just like this.

409
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:15,680
-No, I ain't taking off shit.
-Why not? It's just me. Take it off.

410
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:18,920
All right, fuck it.

411
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,039
Ooh, yeah.
You look like a dried out Chia pet.

412
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,319
Well, at least I don't have
a hideous moustache growing.

413
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:31,920
-That's so messed up.
-Gigi.

414
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,880
Do you really think
this could be the end?

415
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:42,240
Honestly, I don't know.

416
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,920
You really don't believe in God?

417
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,720
Honestly, I don't know.

418
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:53,599
Do you?

419
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:57,960
Honestly, I don't know.

420
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,960
-No jodas.
-No jodas, too.

421
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,880
And listen, I'm gonna do a drive by
for some weed tomorrow.

422
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,840
Desperate times call for desperate
measures. I don't wanna hear it.

423
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,000
Are you okay?

424
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,199
I'll be okay.
You okay?

425
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,719
Yeah.

426
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,679
-I love you.
-I love you more.

427
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:24,679
And please fix
that hideous moustache.

428
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:27,039
-Bye.
-Bye.

429
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,280
MOTHER!

430
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,280
I swear to God, my entire Instagram feed
is sourdough porn.

431
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,039
-Bread. Hot.
-Yeah, but it tastes awful, though.

432
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,960
I mean, think about it,
all these stay-at-home bakers.

433
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:58,360
I mean, imagine.

434
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,079
They don't know what they're doing.
They're just bored and trying to bake.

435
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:06,960
I actually read that there's a whole
art and science to sourdough baking.

436
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,639
How hard can it be?

437
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:12,320
I don't wanna point fingers, but
you burned the pasta last night, so...

438
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,079
I'm just saying, but you did.

439
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:17,039
Sam called.

440
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:18,960
Right.

441
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:24,519
Well, I for one would be very up
for some fresh-baked sourdough.

442
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:26,559
Really?

443
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:29,000
No, you know the thing is,
when this is over,

444
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:31,440
if this ever is over,
I don't think that

445
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:35,320
I want to be one of those
pandemic sourdough people.

446
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,559
-Sorry.
-Whatever.

447
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,119
He's got his new chainsaw.

448
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,920
I'll get us some
sourdough starter.

449
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,119
It can be my contribution to this whole
Little House on the Prairie cosplay.

450
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:48,800
Sure.

451
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,639
Does that painting
look straight to you?

452
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,679
It doesn't look straight to me.

453
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:02,519
I like it better here.

454
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,800
Here? Yeah, yeah.
No, it's good for now.

455
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,000
I don't know if just for now. It's nice.
We have fresh air. We have space.

456
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,679
I achieve some kind of minimal
competence with the chainsaw.

457
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,840
We have all the
firewood we ever need.

458
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,760
Right.

459
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,280
But what if we...

460
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:30,400
I don't know, do you think we'd change,
if we never went back to the city.

461
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,400
Like,
then we'd be country people.

462
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:40,039
You'd spend all your time
splitting wood and I'd...

463
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:42,880
Darn socks, and knit,
and can things, right?

464
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,920
'Cause secretly,
you'd like that?

465
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,719
Little lady looking after the house
while you're busy doing manly things.

466
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,800
I do like the idea
of being more self-sufficient.

467
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,039
-Yeah.
-Less wasteful.

468
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,840
Yeah, of course.

469
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,599
Quite worried
about Dory, though.

470
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,039
It's got to be strange
being stuck up here

471
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,800
in her friend's house
for God knows how long.

472
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,280
And boyfriend's miles away
and I don't know,

473
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,840
she's not exactly bucolic.

474
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,199
No.

475
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,559
I don't know.

476
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,760
People change.

477
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:31,960
And then other folks,
they're gonna say that,

478
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:34,599
hey-o, summertime,
civilization returns.

479
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,440
Testing, testing will save us.

480
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:40,079
Loyal listeners,
you heard it here first.

481
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:43,320
This here, right now,
is hunker-down time.

482
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:58,559
I mean, it's not like I'm saying things
are gonna be back to normal by then.

483
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,320
I'm just saying, there's gonna be
some new normal.

484
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,440
And that is going to be
more like real life

485
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:08,599
than like, you know,
like this.

486
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,400
Well, I mean,
what are people gonna do?

487
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,360
Just be like, mmm, well,
civilization, that was nice.

488
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,800
Shit, that's Sam.

489
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,199
Hey.

490
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:23,679
Oh God, I can't believe
it's 4:00 already.

491
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,920
I've literally done
nothing today.

492
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,239
Did you order
sourdough starter?

493
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:31,039
Black death?

494
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:33,719
Must have been Dory.

495
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:37,440
Does she seem straight to you?
She never seems straight to me.

496
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:40,559
I hate that painting.

497
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:04,920
The YouTube woman said
you had to wait

498
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,480
until it was super buoyant
before baking.

499
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:10,360
All right, so let's just clear up
some misconceptions, shall we?

500
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,199
Prepping's not about a hundred cans
of beans in your bunker.

501
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,960
It's about being prepared for the day
when Grubhub's not delivering.

502
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:20,719
Ready for that day, because if you are,
who's gonna be laughing then, huh?

503
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,760
Bingo.

504
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:54,719
You are alone.

505
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:59,800
Yeah, look around.
That's just that.

506
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,880
Those idiots out there infecting each
other, so they can drink the cosmotinis.

507
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,559
I hope they're happy.

508
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,199
Are you?

509
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:35,840
You baking?

510
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,199
Tonight, there will be bread.

511
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,239
I mean, are we done
flying on planes forever?

512
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:28,079
And explain to me how there can even
be an airline industry anymore.

513
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:32,280
There's gonna be five people per plane.
Explain the economics of that.

514
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:34,920
Shit, I'm sorry.

515
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:39,679
I'm sure you're gonna be able to fly
to London and see Sam again.

516
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,199
At some point.

517
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,920
I'm so glad you like
the tagine.

518
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,000
I got the recipe off the New York Times
cooking app.

519
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:49,119
You should have
some more bread.

520
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,280
I'm okay.

521
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,840
I can feed the mother tonight.

522
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,000
You know, for somebody who ordered
this sourdough starter as a joke,

523
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,599
gotten pretty into baking.

524
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:05,320
I didn't order the starter.

525
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,840
Stop. Don't do that.
I'll do the dishes.

526
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,440
No, it's fine.
You guys cooked.

527
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,400
But relax.

528
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,199
You chopped a lot of wood today.

529
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:35,400
It's all right. Just go watch
something stupid on television.

530
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,679
Sourdough pancakes look good.

531
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:17,719
Here's a recipe
for sourdough pizza.

532
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:39,000
-What have you done?
-Jesus.

533
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,519
Feed me.

534
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,039
Oh, so Europe's opening up.
That's a good sign.

535
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,440
Yeah, yeah, you think
you're going back to work?

536
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:12,559
You're gonna get on the subway with your
friends and the COVID passport, huh?

537
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:14,719
Fat chance, fucker.

538
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,519
This isn't the end of anything.

539
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,760
This is the beginning.

540
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,920
I knit you a sweater.

541
00:47:14,679 --> 00:47:17,519
Where did this come from?
I threw this away.

542
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:20,280
Won't you try it on?

543
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,800
-Jesus Christ!
-I don't want you to get a cold.

544
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,880
-Stop.
-It's a pandemic.

545
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:31,360
What is this?

546
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,360
Mother.

547
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,599
What is going on?

548
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:44,519
I don't want you
to get sick.

549
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,920
Put on the sweater.

550
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:52,159
Put on the sweater.

551
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,559
Put on the sweater.

552
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:22,840
Jim dear.

553
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,920
Oh, Jim.

554
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:38,199
Jim dear.

555
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,920
We're never going back.

556
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:49,880
This is where we live now.

557
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:52,480
Don't you see?

558
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,880
Feed me.

559
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:02,039
Feed me.

560
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,639
Feed me.

561
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:15,199
Apparently, it's easy to make yogurt
in the Instant Pot.

562
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,519
We need cheesecloth.

563
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,800
Do you think we could
make our own butter?

564
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,599
We should get a churn
and a cow.

565
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:30,519
Chickens.

566
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,400
Of course.

567
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,159
Next in line.
Step down, please.

568
00:50:57,199 --> 00:50:59,800
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I just need to get the...

569
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:02,559
Jen, come up to the front.

570
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,199
You should have been under 15 minutes
ago. I'll take it from here. Thank you.

571
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,320
You're gonna
get me in trouble.

572
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,440
They'll get over themselves.

573
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:18,880
-How are the boys?
-They're okay.

574
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:22,800
They've been with Jeffrey's mom in
St. Louis this whole time, which is good.

575
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,159
But I miss 'em.

576
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:29,480
-How are you guys?
-We're good. Giving it over to God.

577
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:34,039
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

578
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:36,599
Thank you so much. I appreciate it.
Stay safe, TJ.

579
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:38,119
You too.
Alrighty. Bye-bye.

580
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:39,880
Next in line.
Step down, please.

581
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:23,679
Two arms, no head.
Two arms, no head.

582
00:53:24,519 --> 00:53:28,719
Two arms, no head.
Two arms.

583
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:45,719
Hello?

584
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:49,559
-Surprise!
-Terumi?

585
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:56,000
I've been trying to call you,
but you never answer your phone.

586
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:58,000
-Why didn't you leave a message?
-Oh my God!

587
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:01,400
I had to get out of the city and I know
that you guys have the pool house.

588
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:07,960
Can you believe there's fucking traffic
during a pandemic?

589
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:09,519
Yeah.

590
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,039
-Are you looking at my hair?
-No.

591
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:12,519
-Please don't.
-No, it looks good.

592
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:14,440
Because I had to dye it
with Just for Men. It's all they had.

593
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:16,199
Oh, you look really good.
You do.

594
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,880
You are really
still an incredibly bad liar.

595
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,400
I'm not lying.

596
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:25,920
I'm so happy to see you.

597
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:30,599
I mean I would be
happy to see anyone.

598
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,679
Even you, Milly.

599
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:34,960
And I hate dogs.

600
00:54:36,519 --> 00:54:37,800
Where are the two Js?

601
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,079
They went to St. Louis
to visit Jeffrey's mother

602
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:41,760
and they kind of got stuck there.

603
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,480
Well, perfect.
Then I can stay in Julius' room?

604
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,639
Then I don't have to sleep
in that crappy bed then, right?

605
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,880
-She's taking a nap.
-A nap? Or is she passed out?

606
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,639
She took a Benadryl, because she said
she was having an allergic reaction

607
00:54:55,719 --> 00:54:57,760
to something
that they put in the eggs.

608
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,360
Oh, she was having
a really hard time in the city.

609
00:55:03,159 --> 00:55:05,679
Jen, when is your sister
not having a really hard time?

610
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,079
I think it's better
when she has a boyfriend.

611
00:55:08,519 --> 00:55:10,119
What happened to Eric?

612
00:55:10,199 --> 00:55:14,360
Well, they broke up, because he decided
he wasn't gonna get divorced.

613
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,519
-I didn't know he was married.
-Yeah. I thought I told you.

614
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,679
No.

615
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:26,920
She is my sister.
What was I supposed to say?

616
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,280
How about no?

617
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:35,519
It's just gonna be a couple of days and
she'll be gone by the time you get home.

618
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:40,159
Well, I'm not exactly sure
when that's gonna be.

619
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:44,800
Why? People are traveling.
You could drive.

620
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,960
Cynthia and Bill just drove
to see her parents in Cleveland.

621
00:55:48,039 --> 00:55:49,320
I want to see you.

622
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:53,639
No, I just think I need to stay here
with Mom and Julius right now.

623
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:57,639
Keep your distance from her.
And no hugging.

624
00:55:57,719 --> 00:56:00,440
-I don't trust her version of quarantine.
-Oh, that crane's back.

625
00:56:00,519 --> 00:56:02,639
I'm gonna take a picture
and show you guys.

626
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:08,079
Okay, babe. I'm gonna hop off, all right?
I'll see you later.

627
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:09,960
Okay.

628
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:19,960
What are sisters for if not to break up
with your boyfriend for you?

629
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:22,360
I can't believe that you actually
managed to do it.

630
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,039
No, but I didn't plan it,
you know?

631
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:27,400
You just went to the bathroom
and it... I just blurted it out.

632
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,960
-What did you say?
-What?

633
00:56:30,039 --> 00:56:32,119
-What did you say to him again?
-Oh my God.

634
00:56:32,199 --> 00:56:36,000
I said, you know, "I have...
I have good news."

635
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,480
-What was his name?
-His name was Tim.

636
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:42,239
I'm sorry. "I have good news, Tim.
You're free to date other people."

637
00:56:45,559 --> 00:56:48,239
Well, it's never been
hard for you to be direct.

638
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,000
-That's for sure.
-Yeah. I got that from Dad.

639
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:53,559
You know,
"You look fat in that dress."

640
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,320
Oh, you always knew
where you stood with him.

641
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,320
Actually, I'm really...

642
00:57:01,639 --> 00:57:03,960
I'm glad he's not around
for all of this.

643
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,480
You should see
Bleecker Street, Jen.

644
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:11,559
It's a war zone.

645
00:57:12,159 --> 00:57:14,360
It's all boarded up.
It's sad.

646
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,800
I mean, I'd have protested too if I knew
I'd get a free Marc Jacobs bag, but...

647
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,559
-Hey, T.
-Oh, I'm just kidding.

648
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,199
Okay?

649
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:27,880
I'm just very grateful
that you're letting me stay here.

650
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,480
Yeah, of course.

651
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:34,000
Of course, she's letting
her sister stay here.

652
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,039
Right, Milly?

653
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,760
Black dogs matter.

654
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,559
Black dogs matter.

655
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:49,760
I suppose this would have
been different

656
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,440
if Dr. J and Julius were here.

657
00:57:52,519 --> 00:57:54,239
What would have?

658
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,239
I don't know.
Just me staying here.

659
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,039
It would have been
more complicated.

660
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,280
It always is with Dr. J.

661
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,880
Hey, you know, he hates it when you
call him that. Don't call him that.

662
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:09,000
Come on, Jen. I mean, anybody
who's been through medical school

663
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:11,039
is dying for you
to call them "doctor",

664
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:14,159
especially when they have
completely defied the odds.

665
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:16,480
The odds?
He went to Harvard.

666
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,000
I think everyone
who knows him knows that.

667
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,559
-I don't mean anything by it.
-You seeing anyone?

668
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,639
Lots of people, you know.

669
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:33,599
Really good time to be dating.

670
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:39,880
I watched some old movie
with Grandma,

671
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,679
went on my phone,
played some video games.

672
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,400
Just sat around.

673
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,039
I went to the supermarket
with dad, took a nap.

674
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:49,840
Honey, can you stop moving around
so much? You're making me dizzy.

675
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:52,320
-Oh, sorry.
-It's okay.

676
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,559
Do you guys have any plans
for tomorrow?

677
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,199
You know,
probably the same thing.

678
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,719
And in the afternoon,
we'll do the march.

679
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,559
-What march?
-Dad said he told you.

680
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,920
But I guess he didn't.

681
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:11,079
Honey, I don't know how I feel
about that.

682
00:59:11,639 --> 00:59:13,039
Mom, come on.

683
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,320
No, because, yeah,
'cause I'm your mom

684
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,719
and I want you to be safe
and I'm so far away.

685
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:20,039
Mom, this is my time.

686
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,719
-It's your time?
-Yeah. Actually, it is.

687
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,360
Okay.
All right, just...

688
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:34,079
Just be really, really careful

689
00:59:34,599 --> 00:59:37,880
and don't get into any trouble
and don't get swept up in a mob,

690
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,800
or anything like that.

691
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:42,079
Do you hear yourself right now?

692
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:45,719
Remember you told me to tell you
if you say anything low-key racist?

693
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:52,159
Okay, so just wear your mask the whole
time and stay with your father.

694
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:54,800
Don't separate from him at all.
At all, okay?

695
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,159
And I'm really proud of you.

696
00:59:59,559 --> 01:00:02,360
-Okay. I will.
-Love you.

697
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:03,920
-Here's dad.
-Okay.

698
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,400
Dad.

699
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,159
Hey.

700
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:12,920
Were you gonna tell me?

701
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,519
Well, I didn't want to
stress you out, Jen.

702
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:18,679
Aren't you worried
about your mother?

703
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,320
So, Julius didn't wanna go,
because he was worried about her.

704
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,559
Then this is what she left
by his bed.

705
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:33,719
"J, you are a spectacular gift
for this Momma Bear.

706
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:36,840
And I appreciate you worrying
about me.

707
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,199
There are many times
in our life

708
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,199
that just being with our friends
and family is enough.

709
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:44,280
But now is not
one of those times.

710
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,440
You are a part of this change.

711
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,079
And this is important.

712
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,719
You go, and be my eyes,
and ears, and voice.

713
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,199
And then wash your hands."

714
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,280
I'm jealous.
I wish I was there with you.

715
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,880
I miss you guys.

716
01:01:07,639 --> 01:01:08,960
We miss you, too.

717
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:16,400
So did uh, your sister call me
"Dr. J" yet?

718
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,440
No.
She's been pretty decent.

719
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:21,599
Right.

720
01:01:23,719 --> 01:01:25,199
What you guys been doing?

721
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:30,840
Um, well, we finished that
parrot puzzle, which is really hard.

722
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:33,840
Yeah, 'cause of that piece
that Milly ate.

723
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:40,400
And we went for a walk
to the liquor store.

724
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,599
How is it that liquor stores
are essential services?

725
01:01:54,719 --> 01:01:57,599
-You look pretty.
-You're a terrible liar.

726
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,440
So, look, I ordered that inhaler.
It should be there for you tomorrow.

727
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:06,800
Thank you.

728
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:09,679
I knew that marrying a doctor
was a good idea.

729
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,760
-You always were the smart one.
-Yeah.

730
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,360
You tired, baby?

731
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,079
When is this gonna be over?

732
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:28,519
-You mean this call?
-No.

733
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:44,159
-I love you.
-Love you, too, babe.

734
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,800
T?

735
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:22,000
What's going on?

736
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:24,639
You all right?

737
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:27,199
Even the Ambien
doesn't do it for me anymore.

738
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:39,920
It's not just you.

739
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,480
Everybody's stressed.

740
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,639
I'm not one of your patients.

741
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,760
I get it. It's a tough time in the world,
and all kinds of people

742
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,880
are going through
all kinds of shit.

743
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,800
But I'm talking about me.

744
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,719
Me! And it just basically seems
that that's not allowed anymore.

745
01:04:01,239 --> 01:04:02,559
What's not allowed?

746
01:04:05,239 --> 01:04:07,840
Needs or feelings,
if you're white.

747
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,719
So yeah. I said it, so you can just
fucking cancel me.

748
01:04:20,599 --> 01:04:22,199
I'm lonely.

749
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,519
And I don't have anyone
who loves me, so...

750
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:40,000
And I defend you all the time
to people.

751
01:04:41,559 --> 01:04:43,280
Defend me to whom?

752
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:46,480
Oh my God.

753
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,320
My super...

754
01:04:54,679 --> 01:04:57,079
Um, people who you think
are your friends. Anybody.

755
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,360
-Mom.
-Mom?

756
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,000
Yeah, Mom.

757
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:04,239
Yeah, she never thought that
you should have married Jeffrey.

758
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:07,119
She thought that you should have
married Daniel from college.

759
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:09,639
-That's because she knows his mother.
-No.

760
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,480
That's because he was white
and she thought

761
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:16,440
that your life would be harder
if you married Jeffrey.

762
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,920
So how come mine ended up being
the one that was hard?

763
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:41,360
Good morning.

764
01:07:20,719 --> 01:07:24,280
I wasn't at my best last night.
And I'm sorry about that.

765
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,159
I know you're in trouble, T.

766
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:31,719
But you can't stay with us.

767
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:22,840
Wait, is that Jenny?

768
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,039
Jenny!

769
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,439
Jenny!

770
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,079
I think she can't hear me.

771
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:39,239
With the march today,
we've now seen

772
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:41,800
10 consecutive days of protests
all in the killing

773
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,600
of George Floyd
by police in Minneapolis.

774
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:47,359
The police officers present
at the time of his death

775
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:50,039
have now been arraigned
in court.

776
01:09:00,079 --> 01:09:03,720
The Reverend wants to use this rage
and madness felt by the public

777
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,039
to try and get
to any police reform.

778
01:09:06,439 --> 01:09:10,520
That's the continued spirit felt here
at the site of George Floyd's killing.

779
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,479
The private funeral service
earlier for invited guests

780
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:17,920
and of course family and friends had
hundreds of people outside in support.

781
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,439
They spoke to the people
at the memorial site

782
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,479
and thanked them
for their love.

783
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,039
We've seen this early report
of growing,

784
01:09:30,119 --> 01:09:34,279
sort of activism spring about that's only
gotten bigger as the week has gone on.

785
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:36,479
As you can see,
this freeway over here

786
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,880
is now kind of turned
into officers own...

787
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:43,119
There's a stage behind me and people
are pointing their fists up in protest.

788
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,600
Because it felt so long
to think that

789
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,800
that is how long that
prosecutor is saying

790
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:50,479
the police officer's knee
was on his neck.
