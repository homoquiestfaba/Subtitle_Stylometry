181
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:50,930
I'm your hammer!
I'm your hammer!

182
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,765
That's it!

183
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,267
And three... two...

184
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,201
Done!

185
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,603
[JENNIFER gasping]

186
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,304
God! He's...

187
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,773
He's in incredible shape!

188
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,074
You keep sayin' that.

189
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:01,608
Yeah.

190
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,443
[TALLY] But so are you,
though. You look good.

191
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:04,477
I'm so sweaty.

192
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:05,445
Well, that's how I like it!

193
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:06,413
I know. I need a shower.

194
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:06,813
Great!

195
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:07,580
Alone.

196
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,782
Come on, I'm gonna
be late for work!

197
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:09,449
Okay, I get it.

198
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,584
I promise I'll have
more time this weekend.

199
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,753
Okay...

200
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,243
It's a date.

201
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:38,745
[TALLY] Wow, you look
beautiful as ever today.

202
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,780
[AUDREY] Kissing my ass
this early in the morning

203
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,117
means you want something,
so what's on your agenda?

204
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,351
Ha! That's...

205
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,854
That's the big question,
isn't it?

206
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:51,591
Look, as you know, I'm married
to your beautiful daughter.

207
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,292
[AUDREY]
Mm.

208
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,693
[TALLY] And look,
I've been a good soldier

209
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:54,828
for the family company.

210
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:55,795
Well, that's debatable.

211
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,330
Debatable?!

212
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,000
Sorry. Look, look, all I
wanna do is talk about this

213
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,669
restitution judgment against me.

214
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,637
Oh, yes, well, there is that.

215
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:07,140
You know you advised
your clients

216
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,309
to make excessive
investments and trades

217
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,344
just so you could make
more commissions.

218
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:15,615
Hmm. Because you told me to.

219
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,953
Yeah, I am sure I have no clue
what you're talking about.

220
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,855
I'm not wearing a wire, Audrey.

221
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,957
All right, honey.

222
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,458
What's the ruling?

223
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,294
Two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars in seven days

224
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,395
orl go to jail.

225
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,731
Sounds like playground
scare tactics to me.

226
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,900
They sound pretty serious.

227
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,868
Your father's rich.

228
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:37,003
Why don't you just ask
him for the money?

229
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,472
Look, with all due respect,
1 would rather go to jail.

230
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,673
[AUDREY]
Well, with all due respect,

231
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,909
you may have to
swallow your pride.

232
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:43,877
[TALLY]
So, you would rather

233
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:46,379
watch your son-in-law be
hauled away by the feds?

234
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,747
[AUDREY]
Well, I suppose that

235
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,750
could be a bit of a scar
on the old family firm.

236
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,918
Yeah. Big one.

237
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:54,020
So, if you just
loan me the money,

238
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,255
all this goes away.

239
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,757
It's a lot of money, Tally.

240
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,058
Audrey, itis.

241
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:02,729
And think about how that
money could go to, say...

242
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,527
...raising a child.

243
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,269
You and Jennifer are
starting a family?

244
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,838
Yes, we are. And that's why
I don't wanna tell her

245
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,006
about all this SEC stuff--

246
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,374
‘cause it's just gonna
stress her out.

247
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,209
And you know what they say?

248
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,077
Stress is nature's spermicide.

249
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,445
They say that, do they?

250
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,847
[TALLY]
They do.

251
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,448
All right.

252
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:26,510
Let me be the spermicide
to your stress.

253
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,723
That means I'm going to
cover your nut for the SEC.

254
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,025
Audrey, yes! Oh!

255
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,294
I... 1 don't know how to
thank you. Come here!

256
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:35,094
No, no, no.

257
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:35,361
Sorry.

258
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,563
But, a first grandchild.

259
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:37,764
That would be it!

260
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,899
Will do. I'm gonna go get
started on that right away.

261
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,035
I love you! Thank you!

262
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,935
Good seeing you, as always.

263
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,271
No clue.

I've got some bad news.

271

some bad news. Ha.

What do you want me to say?

277
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:30,283
Beer?

me to react, huh?

that your father died.

Whatever.

Look, if you're here to ask me
where Mav is, I have no idea.

you take a shot at my threads.

00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:08,104
Hi!

360
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:14,514
This is, uh, Lawrence Graves,
Colt's attorney.

361
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:15,615
[LAWRENCE]
Hi, everybody.

362
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:17,483
I'm sorry we had to meet
under these circumstances,

363
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:20,753
but I appreciate everybody
making the effort.

364
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,489
Colt had a very
specific way in which

365
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,992
he wanted his
will to be read.

366
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,493
In fact,

367
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,757
I'm gonna let him
read it to you.

368
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,465
This thing even on?

369
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:33,499
[tapping]

370
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,002
[COLT]
Hello?

371
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:37,163
Yeah.

372
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:41,707
Well, hi there.

373
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,109
I figure if you're
watchin' this

374
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,011
then that means I must've
already gone off

375
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,013
to that big show in the sky.

376
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:49,315
Oh my God!
He's afraid of heights!

377
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,483
[COLT]
So that means yer sittin' there

378
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,051
wonderin' what in
the hell is in it for you,

379
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:56,189
so why don't we get down
to brass tacks, shall we?

380
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,490
First...

381
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,791
Maxi.

382
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,059
You have given me
some of the most

383
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,295
amazing memories of my life.

384
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,863
[COLT chuckles]

385
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,531
You might be dumber
than a box of rocks,

386
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,400
but you are my box of rocks.

387
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,570
[cries] I'm your box of rocks.

388
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,905
Everybody has to be wonderin'.

389
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,141
She's got a 4-carat
diamond ring,

390
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,845
she's got those fantastic fake
titties that I bought her--

391
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,413
what in the world
do you leave a woman

392
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:23,549
who's got the entire world
by the short 'n curlies?

393
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:24,917
I don't know... What?

394
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,586
My house in Vegas, that's what!

395
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,221
[gasps, screams]

396
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,722
[COLT]
Yes! That is all yours, darlin"!

397
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,190
I know that you
like nothin' better

398
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,359
than to swim naked in
that pool back there.

399
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,060
And you ought to.

400
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,895
It's your best hobby,
and you're damn good at it!

401
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,363
But you know this.

402
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:40,600
I'll be lookin' down
at you spread eagle.

403
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,401
Thank you, Big Devil!

404
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:45,738
I'm gonna swim naked as
a jaybird, just for you!

405
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,273
Uh!

406
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,175
[COLT]
Now the way I figure it,

407
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,676
ColtJr.and I are
sittin' together,

408
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,779
drinkin' tequila shooters
at the pearly gates' bar.

409
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,915
Which leaves my
other two sons.

410
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,783
Tally, let's face it.

411
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,385
There's a 50/50 chance
whether or not

412
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,187
you're even in this room today.

413
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,756
Son, you got your
mother's stubbornness.

414
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:04,857
And Mav.

415
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,591
[COLT chuckles]

416
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,694
Buddy, you're just a 100%,
first class screw up.

417
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,229
[TALLY laughs]

418
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:14,133
[COLT] You be damn proud.
You got that from me.

419
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:17,136
Now I coulda been
a better father.

420
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,905
Sure, but this isn't
about me anymore,

421
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:21,040
it's about you.

422
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,542
So listen up.

423
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,244
If you want my share
of the loot,

424
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,413
then you're gonna
have to work for it.

425
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,049
Both of you are going
on a little road trip.

426
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,552
And don't go thinkin' about one
of you doin' it on your own.

427
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,287
It's not gonna work that way.

428
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,289
At each one of the stops
is a briefcase.

429
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:40,059
On each one of the briefcases
are two thumbprint scanners.

430
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,061
You have to put
one thumb on one side,

431
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,429
one thumb on the otherside.

432
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,430
When you do...

433
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,164
[pop]

434
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,966
[COLT] ...little sucker'll
pop right open.

435
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,001
Ah! know what you're thinkin'.

436
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,837
Mav, you cannot lift
your brother's fingerprint

437
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,172
and put it on the scanner.

438
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,740
Doesn't work that way.

439
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,943
Oh, and you're each gonna get
one of my motorcycles to ride.

440
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:59,011
That's the first part
of your inheritance.

441
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,246
You want the rest,

442
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,181
gonna have to work for it.

443
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,283
All right. Good luck, boys.

444
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,018
Try not to kill each other.

445
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,350
Colt out!

446
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,289
Heh.

447
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,095
[LAWRENCE exhales]

448
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,792
No. This is insane.

449
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,434
Tally...

450
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,833
Excuse me.

451
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,938
Tally! Wait! Tally.

452
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,940
[TALLY] Ward, look, I appreciate
everything you done for us,

453
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,609
but I never asked for one
thing when Dad was alive,

454
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,444
and I sure as hell don't
need it now that he's dead.

455
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,312
Tally, you think
I'm happy about this?

456
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,814
We have to.
It's what Dad wanted.

457
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,215
[TALLY] You don't care
about what Dad wanted.

458
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,216
You just need your inheritance

459
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,951
now that your
bank account is dead.

460
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:39,552
Good luck to you.

461
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:40,653

You stuck-up piece of sh--

462
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,154
Mav!

463
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:45,283

--[JENNIFER gasping] Hammer!

00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,413

[TALLY]
I'm comin!

00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:09,382

Nail me!

Richie Stone?!

479
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,325
I want a divorce.

480
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,850
Damn!

481
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:25,987
[phone rings]

482
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,004
[TALLY]
Hello?

483
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:36,108
Tally. In light of our
current circumstances,

484
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,910
I'm afraid I'm
just gonna have to

485
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,612
cancel our little
arrangement.

486
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:40,446
Wait. What?

487
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,748
I'm so sorry. And you're fired.

488
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,051
Audrey! Don't you...!

489
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:47,553
Don't you hang up.
Oh my God. Oh my God.

490
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,288
Yeah, you would hang up
on me, wouldn't ya? Huh?

491
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,023
Yeah.

492
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,191
Oh, no, no, no.

493
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,225
Goodbye.

494
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,127
Hey, if you think you can
get away with this, honey,

495
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,563
you are sorely,
sorely mistaken.

496
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,465
Because if I go to jail, you're
gonna be sitting right there

497
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,599
next to me! You understand that?

498
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:04,570
Huh? You... Stupid! Stupid!

499
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,640

501
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,576
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah!

502
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,778
Yeah, that got your
attention, didn't it?!

503
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:13,979
Tally?

504
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,781
[sighs]

505
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,884
Ward? Sorry, man, I...

506
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,219
I thought you were
somebody else.

507
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,721
No. I got your message.

508
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,089
What's the haps, mate?

509
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:24,790
[exhales]

510
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,592
Look...

511
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,160
Suppose...

512
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,627
Yeah?

513
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:31,130
I did wanna collect
my inheritance.

514
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,632
There's gotta be a way
out of this road trip.

515
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:34,500
I don't think so.

516
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,503
Your dad arranged it all
through his attorney.

517
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,305
Creep.

518
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:40,639
You're sure?

519
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:41,440
I'm sure.

520
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,942
You're like really sure?

521
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:44,009
I'm like sure.

522
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,745
One hundred percent positive?

523
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:49,482
I'm as positive as I am
that "Jimmy Cracked Corn"!

524
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:49,982
[laughs]

525
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,118
That's hilarious,
Ward. Hilarious.

526
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:52,618
[WARD]
Thank you.

527
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:55,020
Look, hey, I don't even know
how to ride a motorcycle.

528
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,822
Well, Jack Kerouac.

529
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,091
You must get on the road.

530
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,081
Safe travels.

531
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,829
[MAV]
That's a nice office you got.

532
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,264
[LAWRENCE]
Yeah, I got ten of 'em.

533
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,867
I'm gonna franchise.

534
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,869
Oh, look who decided to show up.

535
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:12,371
[TALLY] I'm just doing this
sO you can get your money.

536
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,839
Wouldn't want you
dyin' on the streets.

537
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,608
[MAV]
Oh, how thoughtful.

538
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,543
[LAWRENCE]
Here's your motorcycle permit.

539
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,612
Don't I got to take
a test for this?

540
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,113
[LAWRENCE]
You already did.

541
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:21,680
Remember?

542
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,772
[TALLY]
Oh.

543
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,218
[inaudible]

544
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:29,188
[MAV] Mmm. Would you
look at that custom.

545
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:30,356
It's bitchin', right?

546
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,291
It's just like Colt Jr.'s.
Except Colt Jr.'s

547
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,361
had chicks hanging off the
side like barnacles, right?

548
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,886
Yeah, whatever.

549
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,533
Oh, shit.

550
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:42,368
That one's mine, isn't it?

551
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,804
[MAV] Yup. It's good.
If you have a vagina.

552
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:45,571
[TALLY]
Shut it.

553
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:46,906
[MAV] It's nice.
It's got training wheels.

554
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,240
--[TALLY] I said shut it!
--[WARD] Boys. Boys!

555
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,642
Quit fighting like
little girls. Okay?

556
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,877
Okay. Thumbprints here and here.

557
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,174
[MAV]
Here we go.

558
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,519
Well, well.

559
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,754
If this video is playin',

560
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:02,755
and you are watching it,

561
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,423
that means that
you're together.

562
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,192
And that's a start.

563
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:08,928
Now. Your mission,

564
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:11,897
should you decide
to accept it...

565
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:16,101
[laughs]

566
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,937
I've always wanted to say that.

567
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:19,605
I have! Okay...

568
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:20,439
Sorry.

569
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:23,075
I want you to take 1-40
on past Wickenburg Road.

570
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,211
You are looking for...

571
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:27,112
..."1014 Pine Creek Road."

572
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,081
Where you will meet
your Uncle Elmer.

573
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,182
[MAV]
For real?

574
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,884
[COLT] I thought it'd be a
good idea for you boys

575
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,452
to get reacquainted
with the kind of stock

576
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:35,011
you come from.

577
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,191
Let's get this misery over with.

578
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,421
Call me if you need
anything, eh.

579
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:43,696
[tires screeching]

580
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,562

[TALLY]
Ahh!

584
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:59,078
So. What do you think?

585
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:01,313
[chuckles]

586
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,582
I've seen lots of
dysfunctional families.

587
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,084
Some figure it out.

588
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,219
Some don't.

589
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,387
[WARD]
Oh.

590
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,116
Profound.

The throttle.
The one on the right! Hit it!

595
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,748
[TALLY]
I know! I know where it is!

596
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:36,415
You're a dumbass!

597
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,117
Just go! Just go!

599
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:51,664
Hey, I only got
a quarter tank, man.

600
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:52,865
Let's stop at the next stop.

601
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:54,300
We got at least 48 miles.

602
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,634
We'll go to the next one,
all right?!

603
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,466
How do you know that?!

604
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:06,178
[TALLY grunts]

605
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,513
[TALLY]
How much farther?

606
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:09,448
[MAV] Now what makes you think
I would know that, huh?!

607
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,817
[TALLY] Well, just, pull over!
Pull over! Pull over!

608
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,683
Let's stop for a second.

609
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:18,290
told you! I told you we
should have stopped for gas!

610
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,491
God, you'd think
a quarter of a tank

611
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:20,292
would've gotten
us this far.

612
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,028
And why are you not wearing
a helmet, by the way?!

613
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,496
It's Arizona, dude.
You don't have to.

614
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:25,864
Besides, it's all...

615
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,232
It's part of the
personal brand thing.

616
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,701
[TALLY] Personal brand.
You don't have a brand--

617
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,135
you don't even have
a cell phone.

618
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,837
Yeah, of course I don't
have a cell phone.

619
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,405
It's a part of the brand, okay!

620
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:34,707
It's very off-grid.

621
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:36,642
Off-grid?!
You're not off-the-grid!

622
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,410
You're homeless!
That's what you are!

623
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,003
You're homeless!

624
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,415
[TALLY]
Gah!

625
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:44,717
I still can't get a signal!

626
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:48,153
[MAY laughs]
See what the grid gets ya?

627
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,484
Shut up!

628
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,727
What're you doing?

629
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:55,828
What does it
look like I'm doing?

630
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,596
It's a... It's a map, okay?

631
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:58,897
It's very consistent
with the brand.

632
00:24:58,897 --> 00:24:59,765
Very off-grid.

633
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:00,566
[TALLY]
Whatever.

634
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:02,001
Oh, now you wanna look at it.

635
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,230
[TALLY]
Just shut up.

636
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:06,269
[MAV]
We gotta be somewhere in here.

637
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:11,543
That's not 48 miles, Mav.

638
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:14,346
It's gotta be. Look at it.
Look. This road right here.

639
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,849
And if we take this road,
it's somewhere up there.

640
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,083
We can probably cut
the distance in half.

641
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,284
--It's the best option we got.
--Half?!

642
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:22,221
Half is still 20 or 30 miles!
Th-That's not an option!

643
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:23,389
Okay, well you got
a better idea?!

644
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:25,791
Yes, I do. I say we stay right
here and we wait for a truck.

645
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:26,258
Oh?!

646
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,594
Oh, oh, we should stay right
here and wait for a truck?!

647
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:30,963
You mean the truck that we
haven't seen in two hours!

648
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:32,031
Yeah, then we're due,
aren't we?!

649
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,632
Oh, okay! You do what you want!

650
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,801
I'm goin' that way, okay?!

651
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:37,403
[TALLY]
Mav!

652
00:25:37,403 --> 00:25:38,203
[sighs]

653
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,572
Fine, Mav, just wait!

654
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:41,774
We're gonna leave
the bikes here.

655
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:44,607
We can move faster.
I'll go with you.

656
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:53,318
[TALLY]
What are you doin?

657
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:54,953
What do you mean,
what am I doing? It's...

658
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:57,089
It's the urn.
Somebody might take it.

659
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,323
Oh, yeah.

660
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:01,093
Because, you know, ashes are
a hot ticket for, you know,

661
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:02,461
rover desert bandits.

662
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:04,129
Bro. Colt Montana's
urn on eBay.

663
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:05,798
It's worth at least
600, 700 bucks.

664
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:06,832
I'd steal it.

665
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:07,966
Well, if you're that
concerned about it,

666
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:09,468
why didn't you just
leave it with Ward?

667
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:10,636
I figured we'd dump it

668
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:12,171
when we get to wherever
it is that we're going.

669
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:12,938
Dad would like that.

670
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,107
Well. You might as well
just dump it right here.

671
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:19,178
He spent more time on the road
than he did anywhere else.

672
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:20,805

All right, don't be so dramatic.

684
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,320
All right. Let's just go.

685
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,355
Dramatic?

686
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:39,591
[laughs] Dramatic!

Hey, you think when Colt Jr.
was in Afghanistan

697
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,424
he sat there lookin' around,

698
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,359
and snivelin' like
a little bitch?

699
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,894
Hell no, dude. He was...

700
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:19,264
He was out there, he was kickin'
ass, and he was takin' names.

701

So?

00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:26,138
He died by a mortar
on his own base.

704
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:27,539
He was a tank mechanic.

705
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,108
Yeah, and without those tanks
a whole lot fewer asses

706
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,044
would've been kicked
and names taken, Tally,

00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,805
Hey. Hey.

711
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:01,607
Hey, Tally, wake up!

712
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:02,608
There's a road!

713
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:03,075
[TALLY]
What?!

714
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:03,742
[MAV]
There's a road!

715
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:04,971
[TALLY]
Okay.

716
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,014
Oh, crap.

717
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:10,482
[TALLY]
What?

718
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:11,850
[MAV]
Dude, your...

719
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,185
Your face...

720
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:15,254
It's all... jacked up!

721
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,755
Oh my God.

722
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,091
--Mav. God. Oh my God.
--[MAV] Sh-- Oh, sh--

723
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,926
Like, dude, you slept
in poison ivy!

724
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:21,260
What?!

725
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,261
[MAV] You're like crazy
allergic, right?

726
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:22,794
Yes!

727
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:23,462
Oh my God.

728
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:23,829
[MAV]
Dumbass!

729
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:24,963
May, I gotta go to a doctor!

730
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:25,964
1 gotta get to a doctor!

731
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:26,999
All right, all right.
Okay, well...

732
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:27,966
I can't see, Mav!

733
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:30,302
[MAV]
Hang on. I got you, all right.

734
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:32,971
[TALLY gasping]
I can't see!

735
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,274
[MAV]
Relax! Come on. I got you, Bro.

736
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,475
[TALLY grunts]
Get me outta here.

737
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:38,136
[MAV]
It's right up here. Let's go.

738
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:40,846
[MAV]
Car! Car!

739
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:44,349
Hey! Hey! Hey! Thank God!

740
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:45,350
Hey, thank you guys
for stopping.

741
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,952
Look, w-we need
help really bad.

742
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,353
If you could take us
into the town--

743
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:49,488
[WOMEN scream]

744
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:51,790
[TALLY]
No, no, no, no!

745
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,725
[MAV] Ya know, maybe if you
didn't look like a damn leper

746
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,494
somebody would stop!

747
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:57,996
Let's just go, all right?
It's five miles, we can walk it.

748
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,197
[TALLY]
I can barely stand, man.

749
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,859
[MAV] Come on. We've got
no other choice, let's go.

750
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,240
[DOCTOR]
Okay.

751
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:14,710
Okay, boys,
this is gonna be fun.

752
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:19,651
Let's say "ahh."

753
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:25,181
[ALL]
Ahh.

754
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,027
[DOCTOR]
Yup! Mm-hm.

755
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,929
Just what I thought.

756
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:33,261
I'm gonna need you to stand up.

757
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,768
[TALLY]
Okay.

758
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:37,736
Drop your pants.

759
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:38,937
What?!

760
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:41,506
[DOCTOR]
Gotta drop 'em.

761
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,408
Trust me, I'm the doctor here.

762
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:46,070
Last I heard, I was a doctor.

763
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:50,106
Okay.

764
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,189
Okay... Just bear with me, okay?

765
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:57,856
[TALLY]
Okay.

766
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,559
This might feel funny.

767
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,728
Okay... hee.

768
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:03,695
Och?!

769
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:07,032
Yeah. Wow!

770
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,300
All grown up, huh?

771
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:08,900
Yeah!

772
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,701
[DOCTOR]
Woo-hoo!

773
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,602
[grunts]

774
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:11,903
[DOCTOR laughs]

775
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:13,372
Oh, gentle, Doc, damn!

776
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,272
Does he have a name?

777
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:14,973
[TALLY]
Doc?!

778
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:17,609
What does this gotta
do with anything?!

779
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:18,910
Absolutely nothin'.

780
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,812
What?! Christ!

781
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:21,913
God!

782
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:23,148
No doubt about it.

783
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:24,282
You got poison ivy.

784
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:26,218
[TALLY] Yeah, no shit, Doc.
Good call there.

785
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,619
Hey, um... Hey, Doc?

786
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,454
[DOCTOR]
Yup?

787
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,890
Where did you get your degree?

788
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,092
[DOCTOR]
What degree?

789
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,660
[DOCTOR laughs]

790
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,762
[MAY chuckles nervously]

791
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:38,497
Online.

792
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:39,398
"Online"?

793
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,067
Online? Online. He said...
He said "online"?

794
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,769
--[TALLY] What is that?!
--That's a big-ass needle!

795
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:44,636
It's a steroid shot.

796
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,071
It's the only thing
that'll clear that up.

797
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,739
We usually use it on horses,

798
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,341
but in this case,
this will do.

799
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:51,576
Okay, we're gonna have to get
rid of the clothes, though.

800
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,444
[MAYV snickers]

801
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:53,145
Why?

802
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:53,945
You too.

803
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:54,513
Wait, what?!

804
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:54,913
Why?

805
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,681
[DOCTOR] Because you got
the oil from the poison ivy

806
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,150
all over your clothes.

807
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,751
We have to burn them.

808
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,419
Burn them?

809
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,187
[DOCTOR] Yeah, we can
disinfect the leather,

810
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:05,190
but as far as everything else,
it's gotta go.

811
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,325
Wait a second.
What are we supposed to wear?!

812
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:10,462
1 don't know, but I need you
to take down your pants again.

813
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:12,123
Wait, him or me?

814
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,267
Maybe we should take
down your pants, too.

815
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,929
Just... you know,
to be safe.

816
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,273
[MAV]
Hey, thanks, fellas!

817
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,942
All right, boys! See ya!

818
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,143
[TALLY]
See ya.

819
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:26,838
[MAY grunting]

820
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:42,027
[MAV] I could literally eat
the ass end out of an elephant.

821
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:43,161
What are you talkin' about?

822
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,329
[MAV]
I'm gonna get some grub.

823
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:45,728
Excuse me?

824
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:49,801
[MECHANIC]
Howdy. What can I do ya for?

825
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:54,406
Well, we're a coupla young men
that's stomachs need fillin".

826
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:55,841
What do you got?

827
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:58,076
You come to the right place.

828
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,645
We got, uh, Skunk Jerky,

829
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,247
Pigeon Paté,

830
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:05,383
Lizard Fritters, and, ah...

831
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,919
...my personal favorite...

832
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,154
...Toad Tempura.

833
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,889
Is tha... Is that road kill?!

834
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:13,558
Now what it is, is free range,

835
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:16,828
hormone-free, and locally grown.

836
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,029
[TALLY coughs]

837
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,765
I'll take three of each!

838
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,401
[TALLY] What about salad?
You got any of that?

839
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:24,436
[MECHANIC]
No.

840
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:26,838
Course not.

841
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,274
But we might have
some kale out back.

842
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:31,038
I'll have the kale.

843
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:37,215
Is that bird shot?

844
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,084
You fellas wanna gas up?

845
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:41,186
[MAV]
Yes. Ahh.

846
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,287
Yeah, uh. I'm gonna
hit the head.

847
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:43,588
Go ahead and fill up
our bikes, Tally.

848
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:44,956
[TALLY]
No, no, no...

849
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:46,224
Now that Dad's gone

850
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:47,459
I'm not gonna be
your bank account.

851
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:48,293
Thank you.

852
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:49,528
Look, just take this one, man.

853
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:50,795
I'm... I'm short
on funds. I can't--

854
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:51,930
Shocker.

855
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,765
Come on! Look...

856
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,400
I'll settle up when we
get there, all right?

857
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,595
Sure you will.

858
00:33:57,736 --> 00:33:59,437
It's been declined.

859
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,605
Well, go try it again.

860
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,972
Already run it twice. Declined.

861
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:05,443
[TALLY]
Let me make a phone call.

862
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:08,880
It's probably the traveling.
It's not a big deal.

863
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,577
Go drop the kids
off at the pool.

864
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:18,156
[growls] Ahh, this is
so freakin' crazy.

865
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:18,924
[TELLER]
Dannell's Bank?

866
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:21,126
Ah, yes. This is, uh,
Talladega Montana.

867
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:22,060
[TELLER]
How may I help you?

868
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,262
Uh, look, my credit card
doesn't seem to be working.

869
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:28,633
Yes, a Jennifer Montana closed
those accounts this morning.

870
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:29,301
Bitch.

871
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:30,769
[TELLER gasps]
Excuse me?!

872
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:32,237
I'm not...
I'm not talking to you.

873
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,305
Just, thank you for your time.

874
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:34,431
Appreciate it.

875
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,174
What's the deal?

876
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:37,275
It's what I thought.

877
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:38,643
It's just the traveling.

878
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,245
It'll be back up and
running tomorrow.

879
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,179
Can I pay you with cash?

880
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,414
You take cash here?

881
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:43,949
Look, I'll settle up when
we get there, all right?

882
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:44,416
[TALLY]
Whatever.

883
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:45,440
Thank you.

884
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:47,679
Thank you.

885
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:51,085
Wonderful kale, by the way.

886
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:56,418
>

887
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,138
Oh my God!

888
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:10,842
Oh, God! That smells terrible!

889
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,777
It must've been that food
we ate from the gas station.

890
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,146
Yeah I told you, lettuce
can carry dysentery, Bro.

891
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:16,181
You shouldn't've ate that.

892
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:16,648
[TALLY]
Dude!

893
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,016
You literally ate...

894
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:21,620
Ugh... Skunk
peeled off a tire.

895
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,456
Yes, Tally, but it was a fresh
skunk peeled off the tire.

896
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:25,624
There's a big difference.

897
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:26,958
Who knows how long
that damn lettuce

898
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,221
had been sittin' there?

899
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,542
Hey, d'you ever hear Dad
talk about Uncle Elmer?

900
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:45,805
Nope.

901
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,082
[knocking]

902
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,379
[MAV]
Hello, hello!

903
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,922
[TALLY]
Mav! What are you doin'?!

904
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:59,253
Ah!

905
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:02,090
[MAV]
Hello?

906
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,721
[MAV]
Hello?!

907
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,188
Huh.

908
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:10,769
[MAN C]
All right! Back it on up!

909
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:11,770
[MAV, TALLY]
Shit! Shit, shit, shit!

910
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,538
Get yer hands
where I can see 'em!

911
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:15,870
--[TALLY whimpering]
--Okay! Okay!

912
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:19,506
[MAN C]
Hands where I can see 'em!

913
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:22,614
[TALLY whimpers]

914
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:25,450
Are y'all runaways
from a nut house?!

915
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,384
Ah, j-- No, Sir!

916
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:29,376
We're, uh, we're lookin'
for a guy named "Uncle Elmer."

917
00:36:32,624 --> 00:36:34,392
You're Colt's boys?

918
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:35,293
Yes, Sir.

919
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:36,394
Yeah?

920
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:37,555
[TALLY]
Yeah.

921
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,565
[chuckles] I'll be damned!

922
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:49,941
[ELMER]
So how is the old man?!

923
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,943
[TALLY]
Uhh...

924
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,308
Dead.

925
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,374
Mercy.

926
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,986
I'm sorry.

927
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:02,654
[MAV]
That's okay.

928
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:05,657
It-1t just happened a couple
of days ago, so...

929
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:08,893
W-We're kinda isolated out here.

930
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,729
Uhh. "we"?

931
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,993
Yeah, me and the family.

932
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,768
Colt...

933
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:19,471
Well, come on inside.
I'll introduce you to 'em.

934
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:22,440
I'll get Emma to put some...
to put some dinner on.

935
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,843
Ah, you know, Uncle Elmer,
we're in a hurry.

936
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:26,578
Uh, we actually came
looking for a...

937
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,478
That is nonsense!

938
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:34,418
[ELMER] Son. There's always
time for family.

939
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,579
Now, come on!

940
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:39,757
[TALLY]
Okay.

941
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:44,159
[animals chattering]

942
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:48,333
I see y'all found some clothes.

943
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:49,167
[MAV]
Ah, yeah.

944
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:50,135
[ELMER]
Come onin!

945
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:51,035
[MAV]
All right!

946
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:52,537
[ELMER]
Have a seat.

947
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:54,372
Any, uh, seat in particular?

948
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,808
Any seat that's not taken.

949
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:57,509
Okay.

950
00:37:57,509 --> 00:37:58,810
[ELMER]
Careful!

951
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,178
Uh...

952
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:01,212
What?!

953
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:03,214
You got eyes, boy?!

954
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,342
You almost sat on Aunt Mildred!

955
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,221
Oh? I'm so sorry, I...

956
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:11,711
[ELMER]
Sit here!

957
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:13,548
There?

958
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:17,395
Oh, okay... All right.

959
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,964
Ah, is this, ah... Is this okay?

960
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,132
What's it look like?

961
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,200
Is that a trick question?

962
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,301
What?!

963
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,326
Nothing. Nothing.

964
00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:30,008
[ELMER]
Here you go, sweetheart.

965
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:33,545
What's that?
Uh, where's my manners?

966
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:35,680
Honey, this is Colt's boys.

967
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,982
That's Tally.

968
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,417
And that's Mav.

969
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:43,988
Boys, this here's the reason
I wake up in the mornin'.

970
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,922
It's my wife, Emma.

971
00:38:48,226 --> 00:38:49,093
[MAV]
Uh...

972
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:49,561
Nice to--

973
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:50,595
Nice to meet you.

974
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:53,498
Um. Very... lovely dinner, Emma.

975
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,433
Food looks very delicious.

976
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:56,923
Let's eat!

977
00:38:58,203 --> 00:38:59,568
Okay.

978
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:04,209
Wow! Heh! Wow. These ribs
are very great, Emma.

979
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:08,346
So, um... Thank you.
And... Mildred.

980
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,616
Moist 'n juicy!
Just like you, buttercup!

981
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,106
[laughs]

982
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:19,557
[TALLY] Uhh, did, uh, Dad leave
a... briefcase, maybe?

983
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:23,962
Or... DVD of some sort?

984
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:25,730
[ELMER]
Mmm, doesn't ring a bell.

985
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,733
[MAV]
Nothing at all? A tape or...

986
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,201
[ELMER]
Mmm... Nope.

987
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,370
Now that's enough talk
about business.

988
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,772
It is not every day
family comes to visit.

989
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:37,442
‘Specially family from
your side of the tree.

990
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:40,812
[TALLY] Uh. What...
What side of the tree is that?

991
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:45,984
Well, see, Colt and I
had the same Momma.

992
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:48,286
Let's just say...

993
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:50,421
I look awful lot
like the milk man!

994
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:54,592
[ALL laugh]

995
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,160
I know, Momma!

996
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,663
You always said I coulda
been a comedian!

997
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:01,332
[chuckles] That's a good one.

998
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,101
Here's to Colt Montana.

999
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:04,398
Yeah.

1000
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:07,171
Father.

1001
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:09,173
Brother.

1002
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:12,110
One helluva country
music singer!

1003
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,839
[MAV]
All right, Dad.

1004
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:18,683
Now don't go bringin'
that up tonight!

1005
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:21,653
They ain't got nothin'
to do with it!

1006
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:25,823
Sorry.

1007
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:28,026
Billy just ain't quite got
over the fact yer daddy

1008
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:29,360
broke the duo up.

1009
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,628
The duo?

1010
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:32,664
Oh, that's right.

1011
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:36,134
Wait. Uh, I never heard
Dad talk about a duo.

1012
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:37,268
What happened?

1013
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:41,172
Well... I think Colt
just felt like he'd

1014
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:43,834
stand a better shot
goin' it alone.

1015
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:47,779
[ELMER]
Got up early one mornin'...

1016
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,113
[ELMER clears throat]

1017
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,549
Went to Nashville...

1018
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:53,540
That was that.

1019
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,288
I'm sorry, Uncle Elmer.

1020
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,524
So he ditched you, huh?

1021
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:04,796
Son. If I'd gone off
to Nashville...

1022
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:08,032
...I'd have never met
my sweet Emma.

1023
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:10,501
Far as I'm concerned...

1024
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,994
...that's worth more than
all the fame in the world.

1025
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:20,311
That is it! I have
had it with you, boy!

1026
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,813
You want the belt?!

1027
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,848
You know, Uncle Elmer,
this was wonderful.

1028
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:24,649
Really, really, truly wonderful.

1029
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,818
--We have an early start tomorrow.
--We're gonna head up to bed.

1030
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:27,652
[MAV]
Okay!

1031
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:28,920
[ELMER]
Just leave those.

1032
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,021
Emma'll take care of it.

1033
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:30,521
[TALLY]
Okay.

1034
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:34,559
Ah, thank you, Emma, Billy.

1035
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,584
Excuse me, Aunt Mildred.

1036
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:39,731
Billy, I'm changin'
yer name to Catfish!

1037
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:42,266
You all mouth and no brains!

1038
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,501
[MAV]
He's nuts!

1039
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:43,901
[TALLY]
Yeah.

1040
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:46,104
[MAV]
Let's get the hell outta here!

1041
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:48,266
[TALLY] We're not leavin'
without that briefcase!

1042
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:14,098
Okay... Okay...

1043
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:15,395
Let's go.

1044
00:42:22,774 --> 00:42:27,478
[ELMER] Them stars sure
are beautiful tonight.

1045
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:32,750
Ain't no lights from
the city to drown them out.

1046
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,879
Not a soul around for miles.

1047
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:40,058
You know, before the fire,

1048
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:43,494
there was a porch on the back.

1049
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:46,486
That view's even better
from the east.

1050
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,834
Wish the view's
all I lost that night.

1051
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:57,141
Yer Daddy give me the money

1052
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:59,744
to put this place back
just the way it was.

1053
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:04,282
Down to the square head nails
and the framin' lumber.

1054
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:08,150
Give me the money to make this
place profitable again, too.

1055
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:15,188
5... Somethin' missin' here,
though, ain't there?

1056
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,834
Hey, Uncle Elmer.

1057
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,640
You have a very
beautiful family.

1058
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:42,649
Sure do. Sure do.

1059
00:43:46,057 --> 00:43:48,993
[ELMER]
Hey, boys, look what I found!

1060
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:51,655
This was in the
closet upstairs.

1061
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:55,466
I-1 think, uh, this might
be what you're lookin' for.

1062
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,026
It is, Uncle Elmer.
Thank you, thank you.

1063
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:05,176
All right, well,

1064
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:07,845
you made it to
your Uncle Elmer's.

1065
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:09,247
He is an original, isn't he?

1066
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:10,348
Colt!

1067
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:12,083
[COLT]
I know, I know, I know,

1068
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:14,385
both his oars do not
reach the water,

1069
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:17,722
but that man is a better
musician than I ever was.

1070
00:44:17,722 --> 00:44:19,824
I promise you that.

1071
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,726
Now, I want you to
go to the address

1072
00:44:21,726 --> 00:44:23,761
on that little piece
of paper in the case--

1073
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:25,263
follow it to your Aunt Zelda's.

1074
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:26,864
If she is still there,

1075
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,766
she will know exactly
what you need to do next.

1076
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:30,501
If she is not...

1077
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,770
...you're screwed! [laughs]

1078
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:36,040
Nah, nah, she'll be there.
Big Devil, out.

1079
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:40,945
Zelda! Hell, I thought she's
in jail down in Columbia!

1080
00:44:40,945 --> 00:44:42,747
Maybe she got parole?

1081
00:44:42,747 --> 00:44:45,449
She castrated a federale
with a lawn dart.

1082
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,185
Pretty sure parole
was outta play.

1083
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:48,753
[sighs] I tell you one thing,

1084
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:51,522
if Zelda's anything
like she used to be,

1085
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,058
ain't no tellin' what
you boys are rollin' into.

1086
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:56,394
Keep your head on a swivel--

1087
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:59,030
try not to get shot!

1088
00:44:59,030 --> 00:44:59,697
That's great.

1089
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,199
Will do, Uncle Elmer. Thank you.

1090
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,066
Thank you.

1091
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:03,868
Thank you for everything.

1092
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:06,604
[ELMER] You boys take care,
I... 1 put you some, uh...

1093
00:45:06,604 --> 00:45:09,407
...some deviled hams and
some crackers in here.

1094
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:11,375
That'll travel good for ya.

1095
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,277
l appreciate it. Thank you.

1096
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:15,613
All right, keep between
the ditches.

1097
00:45:15,613 --> 00:45:17,138
[TALLY chuckles]
Okay.

1098
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:22,451
Hey, Uncle Elmer.

1099
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:25,623
Catch you on the way back?

1100
00:45:25,623 --> 00:45:27,387
Ya know, that'd be good.

1101
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,655
Maybe then you boys can
tell me what you wanna do.

1102
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:36,761
Careful out there now!

1103
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:40,338
Hey, what ya think
he meant by that?

1104
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:41,772
[TALLY]
I don't know.

1105
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,741
Maybe he thinks that, uh,

1106
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:48,012
we'll give him money like
Dad did with our inheritance.

1107
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:50,181
There'd be worse ways
to spend it.

1108
00:45:50,181 --> 00:45:52,316
Points to Pop, man.

1109
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:54,910
Yeah, whatever.
Let's get outta here.

1110
00:45:56,988 --> 00:45:59,523
Ignition, dumbass.

1111
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:00,786
[TALLY]
Yeah.

1112
00:46:04,295 --> 00:46:09,290
>

1113
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,469
[MAV] The hell is this?
Some kind of convent?

1114
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,470
[TALLY]
What?

1115
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,172
[MAYV] Bro. What if they're
giving Aunt Zelda

1116
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:49,901
some kind of exorcism?

1117
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:54,412
[TALLY]
Aunt Zelda must be sick.

1118
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:56,013
[MAV]
Why? What makes you say that?

1119
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:58,209
This is where Mom came to die.

1120
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,153
[TALLY]
Now, did we learn our lesson?

1121
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:04,555
There a doorbell?

1122
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:05,990
Don't walk in.

1123
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,550
[knocking]

1124
00:47:09,727 --> 00:47:11,495
Aunt Zelda!

1125
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,496
[door creaks]

1126
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,565
Hello?!

1127
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:18,502
--[NUNS] Reprobates!
--[MAYV, TALLY scream]

1128
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,604
--[NUNS] Reprobates!
--[MAV, TALLY screaming]

1129
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:22,273
[MAV]
Okay! Okay!

1130
00:47:22,273 --> 00:47:24,375
[TALLY] We're looking
for a woman named Zelda!

1131
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:25,242
Tattooed!

1132
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:26,911
[MAV]
She might have a crack pipe!

1133
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:28,612
[NUN A]
Hey! That'll be enough!

1134
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:30,781
Get outta here. Go on, get out!

1135
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:32,550
[NUNS screaming]

1136
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,185
[NUN A]
Go on! You old hens!

1137
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:35,619
Quit your cacklin"!

1138
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:37,053
Get!

1139
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:39,256
What?!

1140
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:42,259
Aunt Zelda?

1141
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:46,230
Saw the news about Colt
in the paper.

1142
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:49,100
Took you little
shits long enough.

1143
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:49,934
You're a nun?

1144
00:47:49,934 --> 00:47:53,104
[ZELDA] Somethin' wrong
with turnin' over a new leaf?

1145
00:47:53,104 --> 00:47:55,706
[TALLY]
Well, no, uh, I just figured...

1146
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,376
...you ever walked into a church
you'd just burst into flames.

1147
00:47:58,376 --> 00:47:59,710
[MAV chuckles]
Yeah.

1148
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,144
[BOTH laugh]

1149
00:48:00,144 --> 00:48:02,747
[ZELDA]
Funny.

1150
00:48:02,747 --> 00:48:06,584
The sisterhood knows
to err is human,

1151
00:48:06,584 --> 00:48:11,322
but to forgive is divine.

1152
00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:13,124
[MAV] I mean, surely if they
knew everything you've done

1153
00:48:13,124 --> 00:48:14,658
they wouldn't let
you in here, right?

1154
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:16,594
Ha! Told 'em, they didn't care.

1155
00:48:16,594 --> 00:48:17,962
Everything?

1156
00:48:17,962 --> 00:48:18,796
All of it!

1157
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:19,563
The sodomy?

1158
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:20,331
[ZELDA]
Mmm... yep!

1159
00:48:20,331 --> 00:48:21,399
[MAV]
The drug dealers?

1160
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:22,099
[ZELDA]
Uh-huh.

1161
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,801
The sodomy of drug dealers?

1162
00:48:23,801 --> 00:48:28,406
[ZELDA chuckles]
Every... Every dirty detail,

1163
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,608
1 told 'em, they didn't care.

1164
00:48:30,608 --> 00:48:35,413
I'm guessin'... this
is what you're here for.

1165
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:36,747
[MAV, TALLY]
Yes!

1166
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:37,281
[MAV]
Thank you.

1167
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:39,511
Diddle-wisps here, please.

1168
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:53,327
These are your momma's ashes.

1169
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:57,435
[ZELDA]
What Colt treasured this urn...

1170
00:48:57,435 --> 00:49:02,206
He wants you two boys
to mix these ashes with his.

1171
00:49:02,206 --> 00:49:05,335
I don't know, spread 'em
where you will.

1172
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:08,540
Thank you.

1173
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,049
Do you remember much about her?

1174
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:13,676
Momma?

1175
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:18,456
Bits and pieces, really.

1176
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:20,825
I was six when she died, so...

1177
00:49:20,825 --> 00:49:22,359
Too damn young.

1178
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:24,395
I was ten.

1179
00:49:24,395 --> 00:49:27,298
Well, if ever there was a woman
destined for sainthood,

1180
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:28,566
it was your momma.

1181
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:30,234
[TALLY chuckles]
Well, hey, she'd have to be

1182
00:49:30,234 --> 00:49:32,336
to put up with a guy
like Dad, right?

1183
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:35,239
[ZELDA] You can think what
you want, but he loved her.

1184
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:39,143
He was never, never
the same after she died.

1185
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:41,145
Neither were we.

1186
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:43,013
We needed our father around,

1187
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:45,049
not somebody that
pretended to be one

1188
00:49:45,049 --> 00:49:46,217
just when it suited him.

1189
00:49:46,217 --> 00:49:48,486
Hey, you watch yourself.

1190
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:52,656
Do you know that, uh, the last
two weeks Mom was here,

1191
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:53,991
he wouldn't bring
us to see her?

1192
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:54,925
Now you wait a minute--

1193
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:58,562
Couldn't bring his own boys
to see their dying mother!

1194
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:02,533
No, no, he'd rather play shows
for drunk hillbillies.

1195
00:50:02,533 --> 00:50:03,767
Hell of a guy.

1196
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:08,572
For your information,
you spoiled little shit,

1197
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:10,908
Colt didn't bring you here
because your momma

1198
00:50:10,908 --> 00:50:13,611
didn't want you to
see her like that.

1199
00:50:13,611 --> 00:50:15,112
He was honoring her wishes.

1200
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:17,882
Oh, by abandoning her two boys.

1201
00:50:17,882 --> 00:50:19,283
Is that honoring her wishes?!

1202
00:50:19,283 --> 00:50:20,718
[ZELDA]
Well, he had a rough patch.

1203
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:21,018
Ha!

1204
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,353
[ZELDA]
He turned it around!

1205
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:23,020
Please.

1206
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,356
He donated a shitload
of money to this place

1207
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,358
and I wouldn't be
here without him.

1208
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:30,127
He snuck mein
the pearly gates,

1209
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:32,129
so to speak.

1210
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:34,965
Yeah, I see what this is.

1211
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:37,067
[MAV]
Tally! Tally, hey. Hey, dude!

1212
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:38,135
Where ya goin"?

1213
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:39,904
May, this is not a road trip.

1214
00:50:39,904 --> 00:50:42,640
This is the Colt Montana
PR campaign.

1215
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,576
He designed this whole trip
so his buddies can tell us

1216
00:50:45,576 --> 00:50:46,610
how great he was.

1217
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:47,545
Aunt Zelda.

1218
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:49,213
[MAV]
Tally!

1219
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:50,915
--[door slams]
--Aunt Zelda, I'm so sorry.

1220
00:50:50,915 --> 00:50:53,417
I don't know what's
gotten into him.

1221
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:57,121
Ya know, sometimes when we...
lose those we love,

1222
00:50:57,121 --> 00:51:00,591
we direct that pain and anger

1223
00:51:00,591 --> 00:51:03,894
towards the loved ones
that we still have with us.

1224
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,096
[MAV]
Yeah, could be.

1225
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:07,965
Or maybe he's just an asshole.

1226
00:51:07,965 --> 00:51:10,601
[MAY laughs]

1227
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:13,571
You are right about that.

1228
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:14,738
Let's watch it.

1229
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,604
Oh, okay.

1230
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:19,109
[COLT]
So, you found your Aunt Zelda,

1231
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:20,177
which means she's still a nun.

1232
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:22,813
Now that there, boys, is
a miracle on its own right.

1233
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:24,181
Amen!

1234
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:26,483
[COLT]
All right, from here on out,

1235
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:28,519
I want you to travel
to Big Jake's.

1236
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:29,787
Directions are in the box.

1237
00:51:29,787 --> 00:51:31,655
You're lookin'
for Jake Fillmore.

1238
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:33,089
Talk at ya later.

1239
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,927
Jake Fillmore.

1240
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:41,498
1 do hope you boys find
what you're lookin' for.

1241
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:44,201
[phone rings]

1242
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:45,269
[TALLY]
I'm done, Ward!

1243
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:46,537
What do you mean "done"?

1244
00:51:46,537 --> 00:51:47,471
I mean done.

1245
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:48,939
I'm tired of Dad
jerkin' us around.

1246
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,107
I don't care about the money.

1247
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,508
I'm not calling
about the money.

1248
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:54,178
Your, um... your
friends at the SEC

1249
00:51:54,178 --> 00:51:56,146
gave me a jingle this morning.

1250
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:59,683
Said you owe a shit ton of
cash in the next 48 hours

1251
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:02,019
or you're officially a fugitive.

1252
00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:03,320
Yeah. I know that, Ward.

1253
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,655
[WARD]
Don't mean to be a gadfly,

1254
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:06,290
but maybe now isn't the time

1255
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:10,027
to let your foolish pride get
in the way of saving your ass.

1256
00:52:10,027 --> 00:52:12,563
Well, hey, prison's gotta be
better than this, doesn't it?

1257
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:16,500
[WARD] I wouldn't know.
Ask Zelda. [laughs]

1258
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,801
How'd you know we
were at Zelda's?

1259
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,037
Oh, well, I watch
the psychic channel,

1260
00:52:20,037 --> 00:52:21,572
you know that.

1261
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:24,742
Oh, seriously, I, uh, figured
your Dad would send you

1262
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:26,510
to collect your mum's ashes.

1263
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:27,978
All else okay?

1264
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,079
Yeah, I'm fine.

1265
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:31,749
[WARD] Listen, mate, um,
don't be stupid.

1266
00:52:31,749 --> 00:52:35,586
You can hate Colt as much
as you want, but...

1267
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:37,521
...keep the bars off
your windows. Mm?

1268
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:40,157
Fine. I'll keep going, but
I'm not happy about it, Ward.

1269
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:44,321
Eh, happiness is overrated.
Ha, ha, ha!

1270
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:46,930
[MAV]
Yo, is everything all right?

1271
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:49,867
[TALLY sighs] Yeah. Good.

1272
00:52:49,867 --> 00:52:50,934
It's good.

1273
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:52,336
Where to next?

1274
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:55,673
[MAV] Dad wants us to see
some guy named Jake Fillmore.

1275
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:57,608
[TALLY]
Okay, well, uh...

1276
00:52:57,608 --> 00:52:59,743
Our bikes are running
on fumes, so...

1277
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:02,079
Yeah, you got those credit
cards up and runnin"?

1278
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,381
Uh... you know what,
I don't know what's goin' on.

1279
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:06,884
The system still
seems to be down.

1280
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:10,220
Well, we need to do somethin',
man, we don't have money.

1281
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:11,415
Yeah.

1282
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,092
[HONEY]
You boys must be desperate.

1283
00:53:15,092 --> 00:53:17,061
[MAV] Desperate? I mean,
that's a matter of opinion.

1284
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:17,728
We're not desperate--

1285
00:53:17,728 --> 00:53:19,763
we just wanna sell
a bike, that's all.

1286
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:22,533
[HONEY] I like your, uh,
your sleeveless look.

1287
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:24,201
Takes a lot of confidence.

1288
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,103
That a branding thing?

1289
00:53:26,103 --> 00:53:28,405
Yes! Yes! Yes, oh my God.

1290
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:31,208
Yes! Finally somebody gets it.

1291
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,644
Okay. Listen...

1292
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:38,415
...this trike sells on the floor
for 25, we'll settle for 18.

1293
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:40,217
I had a trike once.

1294
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,052
Had pink tassels
on the handlebars

1295
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,288
and a Hello Kitty decal.

1296
00:53:44,288 --> 00:53:46,056
Yeah, I was three.

1297
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:49,159
Nowadays, this
is more my speed.

1298
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:52,129
Uh, heh, he-hey, um,
glad you like it...

1299
00:53:52,129 --> 00:53:54,998
Fine, 18 for the bike.

1300
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:56,934
[MAV]
I'm not selling the bike!

1301
00:53:56,934 --> 00:53:58,769
I'll give you five.

1302
00:53:58,769 --> 00:54:00,671
--[TALLY laughs]
--E-Exactly.

1303
00:54:00,671 --> 00:54:04,174
Five? There is 400 miles
on this thing!

1304
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:05,275
What are you doing?

1305
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:06,744
Take it or leave it, I mean--

1306
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:08,512
if you had an autographed
Ramones album,

1307
00:54:08,512 --> 00:54:10,514
or a mint '68 Stratocaster,

1308
00:54:10,514 --> 00:54:12,282
or a unicorn or something,

1309
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:13,909
then we could talk.

1310
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:19,923
Fine. Five thousand,
cash, for the bike.

1311
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:20,524
Hundred.

1312
00:54:20,524 --> 00:54:22,826
[MAV, TALLY]
Hundred?!

1313
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:26,463
Like I said.
Take it, or leave it.

1314
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:28,832
Uhh, could you just
give us a second,

1315
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:32,369
uh, we'll be...
we'll be right back.

1316
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:33,637
Dude, we will go
down the street,

1317
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:34,872
we'll find a place to sell it.

1318
00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:36,173
Let's trade it in. Okay?

1319
00:54:36,173 --> 00:54:39,543
I don't want to sell my bike.

1320
00:54:39,543 --> 00:54:43,180
Fine! Five hundred for the bike!

1321
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:47,284
[HONEY] Cool! Let's go
start the paperwork.

1322
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,286
Look, I know you're
the stock trader and all,

1323
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,388
but this is a terrible
business decision.

1324
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:55,154
Hey. We need the cash, Mav.
Okay? Come on.

1325
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:02,332
I'm gonna buy that bike back.

1326
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:04,701
This is robbery, is what it is!

1327
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:05,736
[HONEY]
Yeah, yeah.

1328
00:55:05,736 --> 00:55:07,638
Oh! Thank you.

1329
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:08,806
I'll, uh,

1330
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:11,241
throw in ten bucks
for these dog tags.

1331
00:55:12,743 --> 00:55:15,512
Not a chance.
They're my brother's.

1332
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:18,849
Okay, well, you have my number.

1333
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:22,149
1 look forward to doing
some more... business.

1334
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,491
Flip ya for who rides bitch?

1335
00:55:53,884 --> 00:55:55,682
[MAV]
Foreclosure?

1336
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:57,743
[MAV]
Huh.

1337
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:00,357
[TALLY]
Huh.

1338
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:05,352
[music plays]

1339
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,971
[MAV] Hey, hey, hey.
They're playin' poker.

1340
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:15,239
Spot me a hundred
bucks of my money.

1341
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:19,643
Ha. Buy into a poker game
where one guy's missing a hand

1342
00:56:19,643 --> 00:56:21,577
and another guy has a knife?

1343
00:56:23,814 --> 00:56:24,781
[MAV]
Yeah.

1344
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:26,617
Absolutely not!

1345
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:27,918
Come on, dude! Look at 'em,

1346
00:56:27,918 --> 00:56:29,987
they're a bunch of marks!
1 got this!

1347
00:56:29,987 --> 00:56:31,989
Wha...? No! Let's just
find Jake Fillmore

1348
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:34,591
and get the hell outta here.

1349
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:35,292
[WAITRESS]
Y'all good?

1350
00:56:35,292 --> 00:56:36,660
[TALLY]
Uh, hey there, Sir.

1351
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:37,394
How ya doin"?

1352
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,988
Uh, lookin' for a guy
named Jake Fillmore.

1353
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,568
Jake Fillmore, right?

1354
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:48,005
Jake Fillmore.
Fillmore. Fillmore?

1355
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:50,838
Fillmore, no? Big Jake?

1356
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:56,980
[TALLY] What? Am I not saying
that's right to you? C'mon...

1357
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,416
Hello.

1358
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,417
Never.

1359
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,518
Never?

1360
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:03,186
Never.

1361
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:04,955
Have you seen me?

1362
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:06,923
Have you seen me?!

1363
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:11,094
Our dad just died.

1364
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,996
Sexy.

1365
00:57:12,996 --> 00:57:15,432
...Tally and Mav Montana!

1366
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,668
Our dad possibly
left a briefcase

1367
00:57:17,668 --> 00:57:20,330
orsome visual element
of some sort.

1368
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:25,275
Is this a bridge troll thing?
Dol need to solve a riddle?

1369
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,843
[MAV]
Uh. I'm gonna hit the head.

1370
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:28,478
Fine, whatever!

1371
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:30,013
Ya know, I've been thinking,

1372
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:32,883
1 get why you got so
upset earlier today.

1373
00:57:32,883 --> 00:57:33,717
Really?

1374
00:57:33,717 --> 00:57:38,221
Yeah. Uh, never really
thought of it, but, uh,

1375
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:41,558
I'm sorry you had to go through
all that shit with Mom.

1376
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:44,994
Well I... Heh.
l appreciate that, Mav.

1377
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,803
Deal me in, fellas.

1378
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:06,917
How 'bout a beer while I wait
for Jake Fillmore, or something?

1379
00:58:06,917 --> 00:58:09,045
Hey, it moves!

1380
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:17,718
Must be a lefty, huh?

1381
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,866
This guy gets it.

1382
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,438
[TALLY]
Thank you.

1383
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:29,539
What is that?

1384
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:31,174
Three?

1385
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,442
Like three dollars?

1386
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:34,745
Not even gonna say that, huh?

1387
00:58:34,745 --> 00:58:38,613
I swear to God, I'm leaving
a scathing Yelp review.

1388
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:47,550
Dammit.

1389
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,394
[TALLY] Hey! What did I
tell you about playin'

1390
00:58:50,394 --> 00:58:51,228
pok... er...!

1391
00:58:51,228 --> 00:58:52,429
[SCUZZ] You wanna back
away from the table?!

1392
00:58:52,429 --> 00:58:52,729
Yeah!

1393
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:54,297
We're in the middle
of a hand, son!

1394
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:55,866
[TALLY]
Whoa! Oh my God! Oh my God!

1395
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:56,767
I'm so sorry!

1396
00:58:56,767 --> 00:58:58,568
Thank you for your
service, gentlemen.

1397
00:58:58,568 --> 00:59:01,367
Buy you a beer later. Yeah?

1398
00:59:03,774 --> 00:59:05,242
[sighs]

1399
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:11,581
Got you a beer.

1400
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:14,414
Wow. Thank you!

1401
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,387
You know those guys
your brother's playing?

1402
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:17,921
[TALLY]
Mm-hm.

1403
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:19,489
They can be pretty rough.

1404
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:21,224
I hope he knows what he's doing.

1405
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:24,061
Well, l assure you he doesn't.

1406
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:25,395
You have a nice chin.

1407
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,659
I wouldn't mind
having sex with you.

1408
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:32,069
[TALLY]
Wow, you're a--

1409
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:33,804
Hot as shit. I know.

1410
00:59:33,804 --> 00:59:36,006
[TALLY laughs]

1411
00:59:36,006 --> 00:59:38,075
Yeah, a, well...

1412
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:41,011
I was gonna say "forward" but...

1413
00:59:41,011 --> 00:59:43,447
Are you a virgin or something?

1414
00:59:43,447 --> 00:59:45,015
No! [laughs]

1415
00:59:45,015 --> 00:59:46,016
No.

1416
00:59:46,016 --> 00:59:47,784
Bull! He cheated!

1417
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:49,119
[MAV]
That's bullshit and you know it.

1418
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,487
It ain't my fault
you can't hold on

1419
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:51,488
to your hand in a flush.

1420
00:59:51,488 --> 00:59:53,090
I've been playing cards
for 30 years--

1421
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,991
nobody gets that kinda draw
on the first damn hand.

1422
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:57,160
All right, all right, just calm
your titties, Denzel, okay?

1423
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,763
Ow, ow, shit!
You're strong... you're strong!

1424
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:01,465
Are you gonna help him out?

1425
01:00:01,465 --> 01:00:02,299
Do I have to?

1426
01:00:02,299 --> 01:00:03,789
[SOFIA]
Uh-huh.

1427
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:07,504
[TALLY]
Hey! Guys, hey, uh...!

1428
01:00:07,504 --> 01:00:09,372
Uh... What if we, uh,
take a breather?

1429
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:11,174
[TALLY whimpering]

1430
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:13,310
Okay. Hey, hey, hey,
hey, before we start

1431
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:14,611
the rhinoplasty--maybe
we could just--

1432
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,012
Why don't we add his
nose to the pot?

1433
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:17,514
No! No, no, no, no.

1434
01:00:17,514 --> 01:00:19,175
Enough!

1435
01:00:20,517 --> 01:00:22,352
[MAYV groaning]

1436
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:25,722
[JAKE] Where do you shaved-tail
sons of bitches get off

1437
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:28,225
makin' trouble in my bar?!

1438
01:00:28,225 --> 01:00:30,160
[TALLY whimpers]
Ahh, listen!

1439
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,662
Uhh, pirate king, Sir, uh,

1440
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:36,199
th-that's my brother, and our...
our dead dad sent us here.

1441
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:37,701
You know what, long story.

1442
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:39,836
Um. If you would just have
Edward Scissorhand

1443
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:41,338
kindly remove this
from my septum,

1444
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:44,574
we-we'll just get
the hell outta here.

1445
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:46,309
You Colt Montana's boys?

1446
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:46,910
Yeah!

1447
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:47,744
Nope.

1448
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:49,846
No. No.

1449
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:51,982
Uh. Yeah...

1450
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:55,152
[TALLY]
Mmm... Yes?

1451
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:59,256
Why didn't you say so?
All right, boys.

1452
01:00:59,256 --> 01:01:02,359
Been expectin' ya.
Jake Fillmore.

1453
01:01:02,359 --> 01:01:04,261
[TALLY]
Nice to meet you, Jake! Tally.

1454
01:01:04,261 --> 01:01:04,928
Mav.

1455
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:07,063
Yeah. All right.

1456
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:09,733
Let me punch him, Jake.
Just once.

1457
01:01:09,733 --> 01:01:13,533
[sighs] We'll see.
Let's get a beer.

1458
01:01:15,739 --> 01:01:17,434
Here you go, Scuzz.

1459
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:20,236
Nope.

1460
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,216
So when your dad and I got
discharged from the army,

1461
01:01:26,216 --> 01:01:27,951
I set up shop here.

1462
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:29,553
And he, Mister Big Stuff,

1463
01:01:29,553 --> 01:01:31,755
was the house band, right there.

1464
01:01:31,755 --> 01:01:33,223
[MAV, TALLY]
Oh, yeah?

1465
01:01:33,223 --> 01:01:35,358
[TALLY] I didn't know there
was a stage back there.

1466
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:38,528
Yeah, real stage we lost
to the infestation.

1467
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,729
Oh shit, termites?

1468
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:41,765
Bobcats.

1469
01:01:41,765 --> 01:01:42,732
And you know this place

1470
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:45,101
used to rock real
good sometimes.

1471
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:47,137
Not so much anymore, though.

1472
01:01:47,137 --> 01:01:51,708
Bank might close
us down. Whatever.

1473
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,276
Well maybe if you wouldn't
give your beer away

1474
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:54,945
you wouldn't have
that problem.

1475
01:01:54,945 --> 01:01:56,580
[JAKE] Those guys are
Vet buddies of mine.

1476
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:58,281
Some have only got
the shirts on their backs

1477
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:00,383
and those are borrowed.

1478
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,785
[MAV]
Seems messed up.

1479
01:02:01,785 --> 01:02:03,286
It's hard luck for boys
who just signed up

1480
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:04,287
to serve their country.

1481
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,722
[TALLY] Yeah, ya know,
I think some people enlist

1482
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,986
just to run away
from family problems.

1483
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:15,599
Um, you said somethin'
'bout a tape

1484
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,300
hanging around here
or somethin?

1485
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,961
Uhh, yeah.

1486
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,174
[JAKE]
I haven't got a player,

1487
01:02:24,174 --> 01:02:26,576
but, uh, we can just
close up early,

1488
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:27,944
go to my place,
have a barbecue.

1489
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:29,179
You boys can watch it there.

1490
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:30,113
You know what,

1491
01:02:30,113 --> 01:02:31,448
we've got DVDs in
the hotel room--

1492
01:02:31,448 --> 01:02:33,143
We'd love to.

1493
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:35,741
Well, all right then.

1494
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:39,122
Okay.

1495
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:44,094
[music playing]

1496
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:47,086
[people chattering]

1497
01:03:03,647 --> 01:03:08,312
So. How 'bout them Padres?

1498
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:12,055
[JAKE]
Hey everybody, uh,

1499
01:03:12,055 --> 01:03:14,149
gather 'round for a minute.

1500
01:03:16,326 --> 01:03:18,795
First of all, uh,
thanks for comin'.

1501
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,330
Short notice and everything.

1502
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:23,667
As soldiers, we know
better than most

1503
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:27,537
that knife's edge between
here and hereafter.

1504
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:31,308
Today we met Talladega
and Maverick Montana.

1505
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:33,209
Their brother Colt Jr.'s
one of those soldiers

1506
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:35,812
we'll see on the otherside.

1507
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:39,649
I wanna say a little prayer.

1508
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,184
Dear Lord,

1509
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:43,420
we wanna take a moment
to honor Colt Jr.

1510
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:45,588
and the brothers and sisters
that we've lost.

1511
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,424
Please help keep us strong,

1512
01:03:47,424 --> 01:03:50,493
for we are soldiers,
proud and true,

1513
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,329
no matter what cards
we're dealt.

1514
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:54,931
[sCUZZ]
And speaking of cards, Lord,

1515
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:56,900
try and forgive
that one there...

1516
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,234
...for cheating me at cards!

1517
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:00,337
Oh, please, Lord...
it was so obvious.

1518
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:02,439
Uhm! Amen!

1519
01:04:02,439 --> 01:04:03,673
[ALL]
Amen!

1520
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:06,042
Uh. One other thing.

1521
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:09,279
This is, um, Colt Jr.'s
interment flag.

1522
01:04:09,279 --> 01:04:10,447
Your Daddy made me promise

1523
01:04:10,447 --> 01:04:12,541
to get it to you guys
safe and sound.

1524
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,754
Thank you.

1525
01:04:17,754 --> 01:04:19,456
Now let's eat some beef!
Come on!

1526
01:04:19,456 --> 01:04:21,254
[ALL cheer]

1527
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:27,731
Okay.

1528
01:04:27,731 --> 01:04:29,933
All right, boys, listen to me,

1529
01:04:29,933 --> 01:04:32,302
your next stop...

1530
01:04:32,302 --> 01:04:33,603
...Turkey Track Road.

1531
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:35,705
I know you're probably
kickin' yourselves

1532
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:36,473
now that you've heard it,

1533
01:04:36,473 --> 01:04:38,608
maybe even already
figured it out.

1534
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:41,211
But I have figured that
there is no better place

1535
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:44,247
for you two to end
this journey, all right?

1536
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:48,980
That's it, your Dad,
CM, over and out.

1537
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:03,297
[door opens]

1538
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:05,568
[TALLY]
Whoa!

1539
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,137
I'm so sorry!
Did you need to use...?

1540
01:05:07,137 --> 01:05:08,127
Mmm!

1541
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:11,975
Did you need to use
the bathroom?

1542
01:05:11,975 --> 01:05:13,636
--No thank you.
--[TALLY] Okay.

1543
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:16,312
[TALLY]
Um, look, uh...

1544
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:18,815
I-1 just split up
with my wife so...

1545
01:05:18,815 --> 01:05:20,283
you know.

1546
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:22,819
[SOFIA] Listen, I grew up
in a military base.

1547
01:05:22,819 --> 01:05:23,920
And with my friends,

1548
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,922
any goodbye could be
the last goodbye.

1549
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:27,424
Some point, I learned that

1550
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:30,794
life is too short
to be wasting time.

1551
01:05:30,794 --> 01:05:32,629
So why don't you ask yourself:

1552
01:05:32,629 --> 01:05:35,265
Is she really worth
wasting time for?

1553
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:38,134
[TALLY] Mmm. Yeah,
look, here's the thing,

1554
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:41,805
I haven't had, uh,
sex in along time, so...

1555
01:05:41,805 --> 01:05:44,841
Th-- Um. This isn't
gonna last very long.

1556
01:05:44,841 --> 01:05:46,775
All right. I'll race you.

1557
01:06:03,393 --> 01:06:05,361
[MAV]
Well, hey there...

1558
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:11,826
[sighs]

1559
01:06:15,572 --> 01:06:18,475
[TALLY laughing]

1560
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:20,910
Hey, gettin' some ice, huh?

1561
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:22,378
"Gettin' some ice, huh?"

1562
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:24,180
What?

1563
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:27,050
[MAV]
Nothing. See ya outside, 'kay?

1564
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:29,314
Fine. Ha!

1565
01:06:39,229 --> 01:06:42,199
[chattering laughing]

1566
01:06:52,275 --> 01:06:53,276
You got the map, let's go.

1567
01:06:53,276 --> 01:06:55,378
[TALLY] What're you talking
about, man? I just got my beer.

1568
01:06:55,378 --> 01:06:56,539
Stay awhile.

1569
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:02,285
There. Better?

1570
01:07:02,285 --> 01:07:04,854
Mav!

1571
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:06,720
Look, guys, excuse me. He's...

1572
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:10,126
Hey, what's your problem?

1573
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:12,896
My problem? You've had
a fire up your ass

1574
01:07:12,896 --> 01:07:15,064
this entire trip. Now suddenly
1 try to move things along

1575
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:17,931
and I'm the asshole?!
Get on the bike.

1576
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,539
Hey guys, uh,
we're gonna take off.

1577
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:24,940
Thank you so much
for everything, Jake.

1578
01:07:29,746 --> 01:07:31,373
[JAKE]
Be safe!

1579
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:34,150
[TALLY]
Hey, what about my helmet?

1580
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:35,618
What about my helmet?!

1581
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:42,425
[TALLY sighs] Man, I could've
been hit in the head

1582
01:07:42,425 --> 01:07:45,827
with a rock, man, let me...
ride without a damn helmet!

1583
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,966
[TALLY]
Closed for the season, huh?

1584
01:07:49,966 --> 01:07:53,336
I don't recognize any
of this, by the way.

1585
01:07:53,336 --> 01:07:54,137
Do you?

1586
01:07:54,137 --> 01:07:55,605
Mav!

1587
01:07:55,605 --> 01:07:57,903
Mav, wait a second, man!

1588
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:04,581
[TALLY]
Mav! Dang it. Mav!

1589
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:06,683
Mav! Mav, dude, w--!

1590
01:08:06,683 --> 01:08:08,351
[MAV] Just don't
touch me, all right?!

1591
01:08:08,351 --> 01:08:10,086
[TALLY]
What? What is your problem?

1592
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,754
[MAV]
You're a dick, d'you know that?!

1593
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:14,123
I saw you at the barbecue
with Sofia!

1594
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:14,824
So?

1595
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:16,326
So?! Asshole!

1596
01:08:16,326 --> 01:08:17,860
You're married to
my ex, Jennifer,

1597
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,929
or-or did you just
forget that, huh?

1598
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:22,198
Oh, I'm-- God, I'm so sorry,
1 didn't realize you were still

1599
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:24,033
butt hurt over your
high school crush!

1600
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:24,934
Really?

1601
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:26,769
Brotherhood means nothin'
to you, does it?

1602
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,438
What're you talkin' about?!

1603
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:30,640
Tally, they put that flag
on Colt Jr.'s casket.

1604
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,874
You don't even give
a shit, do you?

1605
01:08:31,874 --> 01:08:33,843
[TALLY]
Colt Jr... No, I don't!

1606
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:34,444
You know why?

1607
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:36,379
'Cause l am so sick of
everybody talkin' about

1608
01:08:36,379 --> 01:08:37,847
what kind of hero
that guy was!

1609
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:39,949
If he's such a hero,
why did he walk out on us

1610
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:41,284
just like our drunk-ass father?!

1611
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:42,376
--[MAV yells]
--[TALLY] Ah!

1612
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,216
[MAV]
I'm sorry, I-I--

1613
01:08:51,828 --> 01:08:54,320
[MAV]
No! No, no, no, no!

1614
01:08:56,366 --> 01:08:57,000
[MAV]
No...

1615
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:57,500
[TALLY]
Mav.

1616
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:58,801
Just get away from it, okay?!

1617
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:00,235
[TALLY]
All right.

1618
01:09:34,771 --> 01:09:37,001
Me and Jen are
getting a divorce.

1619
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:39,569
What?

1620
01:09:41,411 --> 01:09:45,939
Walked in on her gettin' nailed
by her fitness instructor.

1621
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:49,352
Shit, dude...

1622
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:50,842
That's rough.

1623
01:09:52,588 --> 01:09:55,525
She canceled the
credit cards, didn't she?

1624
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:58,394
Yep.

1625
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:00,863
I'm a bigger screw-up than
you by a long shot, buddy.

1626
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:03,199
[MAV] Heh. Naw, one
little pesky divorce

1627
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:07,370
doesn't even get you within
striking distance of me, man.

1628
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:09,872
Not just the divorce, Mav.

1629
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:13,376
The reason I've been rushing
this whole time is, ah...

1630
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:16,903
I'm in trouble... with the SEC.

1631
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:20,547
Football Conference?

1632
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:28,825
No, no. It's money
stuff. It's, uh...

1633
01:10:28,825 --> 01:10:32,995
1 did some dishonest things
to impress my mother-in-law.

1634
01:10:32,995 --> 01:10:36,899
CliffsNotes are: I pay 250
thousand dollars in two days...

1635
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,635
...orl goto jail.

1636
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:41,904
Oh. Sh...

1637
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:43,106
That's really messed up.

1638
01:10:43,106 --> 01:10:44,335
Yeah.

1639
01:10:49,445 --> 01:10:50,980
It's cold tonight!

1640
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:51,781
Tell you this--

1641
01:10:51,781 --> 01:10:53,950
what's a night around a camp
fire without a little brandy?

1642
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:55,985
Hey! Where'd you get that?

1643
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:58,254
Ah, Jake gave it to me.
Back at his house.

1644
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:03,025
He said, uh, he and Dad used to
drink it way back in the day.

1645
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:03,860
Hulls.

1646
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:04,427
Yeah.

1647
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:06,293
Ginger Brandy.

1648
01:11:09,165 --> 01:11:11,634
[MAYV clears throat]

1649
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:13,534
--Good?
--Not bad!

1650
01:11:14,704 --> 01:11:17,969
[coughing]

1651
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:22,378
Pussy.

1652
01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:25,109
Ha. Yeah, whatever, dude.

1653
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:32,355
Hey, Tally, can I
ask you somethin'?

1654
01:11:32,355 --> 01:11:33,723
Sure.

1655
01:11:33,723 --> 01:11:36,192
Why do you hate Dad so much?

1656
01:11:36,192 --> 01:11:37,894
How can you not?

1657
01:11:37,894 --> 01:11:41,731
Y'know, I never understood how
you forgave him so easily.

1658
01:11:41,731 --> 01:11:44,634
I forgive him, man--all right,

1659
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:46,803
s0, 50 he drank too much,

1660
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:48,070
he wasn't home. I get it.

1661
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:51,808
But... It's not like he
beat us or anything, man.

1662
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:56,145
He was a flawed man for sure,
I-1 totally get that.

1663
01:11:56,145 --> 01:12:00,249
[sighs] All right. Dad,
1 guess I can understand,

1664
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:02,240
but Colt Jr.?

1665
01:12:06,189 --> 01:12:08,724
He left us, Mav.

1666
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:11,761
He didn't have to go back
for a second tour.

1667
01:12:11,761 --> 01:12:15,498
We needed him after Mom died,
and he left. Just like Dad.

1668
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:16,999
It-It's not like he
joined the circus;

1669
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:18,234
he did somethin'
noble with his life,

1670
01:12:18,234 --> 01:12:19,502
he joined the service, it's--

1671
01:12:19,502 --> 01:12:20,336
You still don't get it.

1672
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:21,771
No, you're right,
I don't get it!

1673
01:12:21,771 --> 01:12:23,739
--Please help me understand!
--He died!

1674
01:12:26,209 --> 01:12:29,406
Okay?! He died!

1675
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:33,349
He never came back!

1676
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:36,452
And I hate him for it.

1677
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:39,755
I mean, he was the one
constant in our lives.

1678
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:43,192
That was our big brother, man!

1679
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:44,961
The protector.

1680
01:12:44,961 --> 01:12:46,793
And he took off!

1681
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,234
Before he left, I...

1682
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:58,139
I never got the chance
to tell him...

1683
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:04,943
...that I loved him. Ya know?

1684
01:13:06,616 --> 01:13:08,141
Yeah.

1685
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:46,923
[MAV] Are you sure he didn't
give us a landmark,

1686
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:47,757
or coordinates or anything?

1687
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:49,325
I mean, we are literally
in the middle of nowhere.

1688
01:13:49,325 --> 01:13:51,193
No! He just said we'd
be kicking ourselves

1689
01:13:51,193 --> 01:13:53,025
for not recognizing it.

1690
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:54,997
[MAV]
Yup.

1691
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:57,033
[TALLY]
We need that stupid-ass chuckle.

1692
01:13:57,033 --> 01:13:58,801
[MAY laughs]
Yeah, you remember that chuckle?

1693
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:01,203
[TALLY]
Yeah. I know where we are!

1694
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:01,837
[MAV]
You do?

1695
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:03,439
[TALLY] Remember, I got
that scar on my left leg

1696
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,942
Colt Jr., he... pushed me
off the front porch.

1697
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:08,536
[MAV]
Heh! Oh, yeah.

1698
01:14:12,682 --> 01:14:14,047
[MAV]
Whew.

1699
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,454
[TALLY]
Heh.

1700
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:21,446
[MAV]
Safe. Safe. Safe...

1701
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:29,458
Found it!

1702
01:14:33,336 --> 01:14:34,537
[MAV]
Heh!

1703
01:14:34,537 --> 01:14:35,671
[TALLY]
Huh.

1704
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:37,639
Hello, boys!

1705
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,208
Ward!

1706
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:39,742
What--?

1707
01:14:39,742 --> 01:14:40,376
What are you, uh...

1708
01:14:40,376 --> 01:14:41,477
...doin" here?

1709
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:42,645
Yeah?

1710
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:44,814
I'm here to collect
what's rightfully mine!

1711
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:45,214
[TALLY]
Jeez!

1712
01:14:45,214 --> 01:14:48,484
Oh, shi...! Just put
the gun down, all right?

1713
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:49,819
You remember? We
grew up together!

1714
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:50,653
Ah. We're family!

1715
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:53,222
Bollocks! You boys are family.

1716
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:55,491
I'm nothin' but
the loyal servant

1717
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:57,326
who got shafted from the will!

1718
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:58,094
All right.

1719
01:14:58,094 --> 01:14:59,895
What, hey-- What--
D-Did you... track us here?

1720
01:14:59,895 --> 01:15:04,400
[WARD laughs]
Tallywacker, GPS tracker!

1721
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:08,170
All the years I looked
after your old man,

1722
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,839
made 'im a star,

1723
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:11,874
held his head when
your mum died,

1724
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:14,577
arranged his hookers
after she was gone!

1725
01:15:14,577 --> 01:15:18,347
All the while,
hating country music!

1726
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,182
Hmm, and what do I get from it?

1727
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:23,252
Me? Nothing! Bloody nothing!

1728
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:25,354
Okay, hey!

1729
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:25,755
Money?

1730
01:15:25,755 --> 01:15:26,122
Yeah!

1731
01:15:26,122 --> 01:15:27,223
[TALLY]
Is that what this is about?

1732
01:15:27,223 --> 01:15:28,384
Yeah!

1733
01:15:29,558 --> 01:15:32,695
Take it. We don't need it.

1734
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:34,230
Wh-Wh-What do you mean
we don't need it?

1735
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:35,131
I need the money! I can't--

1736
01:15:35,131 --> 01:15:37,400
We don't need it.
It's just money.

1737
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,435
[WARD]
He's right! It's just money.

1738
01:15:39,435 --> 01:15:42,302
And it's mine!
Now open the safe!

1739
01:15:47,076 --> 01:15:49,078
What happens if we didn't?

1740
01:15:49,078 --> 01:15:51,213
I'll... shoot you both,

1741
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:52,381
cut your hands off,

1742
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:55,084
and open the safe myself.

1743
01:15:55,084 --> 01:15:57,486
You know, the thing is,
1 don't think you would.

1744
01:15:57,486 --> 01:15:59,555
I mean, come on, we grew
up together, you know--

1745
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:01,757
[MAV]
Oh, shit!

1746
01:16:01,757 --> 01:16:03,726
He shot you! He shot you!

1747
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:06,062
You shot me! You shot me!

1748
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:07,430
[MAV] Ya know what?
He told you he would!

1749
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:08,831
I didn't think he would
actually do it!

1750
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,598
Well, he did it!

1751
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:11,100
You want another one? Hmm?

1752
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:12,501
Honestly, Ward, no!

1753
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:15,071
I would be bummed
if you shot me again!

1754
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,405
Then open the safe!

1755
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:20,443
[MAV] Okay, okay. Just...
Come on, come on, Tally.

1756
01:16:20,443 --> 01:16:21,477
You're an idiot, Ward.

1757
01:16:21,477 --> 01:16:22,311
Get up!

1758
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:24,346
[MAV]
Just get up and open the safe!

1759
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:24,780
[TALLY]
Ah!

1760
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,982
[MAV] J-Just... Okay. All right.
All right, just, c'mon, c'mon.

1761
01:16:26,982 --> 01:16:28,484
Okay. All right.
We're-We're doin' it!

1762
01:16:28,484 --> 01:16:31,078
[WARD]
Thumbs up! Yep!

1763
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:37,693
What the bleedin' hell?

1764
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:38,994
Where's the money?!

1765
01:16:38,994 --> 01:16:39,495
We don't know!

1766
01:16:39,495 --> 01:16:41,097
[MAV] There was supposed
to be money in there, I-1...

1767
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:42,765
[TALLY] The DV--you have
to play that DVD!

1768
01:16:42,765 --> 01:16:44,333
You play the DVD!

1769
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:45,468
You shot me!

1770
01:16:45,468 --> 01:16:46,769
You play the DVD.

1771
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:49,438
[MAV]
Okay... all right...

1772
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:51,207
Okay, all right.

1773
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:54,336
It's good. Okay...

1774
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:02,318
Well, boys, you made it.

1775
01:17:02,318 --> 01:17:04,854
Now this place was very, very
special to your mom and I.

1776
01:17:04,854 --> 01:17:07,223
But, quite honestly,
after she died,

1777
01:17:07,223 --> 01:17:10,126
the memories were
just too painful.

1778
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:12,528
But you can make your own
memories, right here.

1779
01:17:12,528 --> 01:17:15,831
You can do that. And I want
you to remember this, boys--

1780
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:19,902
every day you live is like
another grain of sand

1781
01:17:19,902 --> 01:17:22,735
falling through that hourglass.

1782
01:17:23,506 --> 01:17:24,905
[WARD]
That's it?

1783
01:17:26,242 --> 01:17:27,576
Where's the money?!

1784
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:29,245
Y-You heard the same
thing we did, okay?!

1785
01:17:29,245 --> 01:17:30,312
There's no money!

1786
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:33,082
[TALLY] Yeah! Ward,
we don't know, that's it!

1787
01:17:33,082 --> 01:17:34,817
What a pisser!

1788
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:37,920
[MAV]
Oh. God, okay, okay. Okay.

1789
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:38,854
You calmed?

1790
01:17:38,854 --> 01:17:39,722
Yeah...

1791
01:17:39,722 --> 01:17:42,057
Now let's get my ass to
the hospital because...

1792
01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:43,893
...I'm losin' a lot
of blood over here, okay?

1793
01:17:43,893 --> 01:17:44,894
Okay...

1794
01:17:44,894 --> 01:17:47,363
[COLT] Aw, hell, I'm just
screwin' with ya!

1795
01:17:47,363 --> 01:17:49,498
There's a false back on the
safe. Just hit the bottom,

1796
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:51,033
the sucker'll pop right open!

1797
01:17:51,033 --> 01:17:53,869
Now look, I have done what I
could do for those in need,

1798
01:17:53,869 --> 01:17:56,438
lam a philanthropist of sorts,

1799
01:17:56,438 --> 01:17:59,175
so we're not talkin' about
a huge fortune here.

1800
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:00,009
The way I figure it,

1801
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:02,278
between this money
and my music catalogue,

1802
01:18:02,278 --> 01:18:04,914
this'll start you boys
out on your fortune.

1803
01:18:04,914 --> 01:18:07,016
Okay? This's your Dad.

1804
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:09,285
See you on the B side.

1805
01:18:09,285 --> 01:18:10,119
Now check it!

1806
01:18:10,119 --> 01:18:12,221
[MAV]
Okay, okay!

1807
01:18:12,221 --> 01:18:16,725
Dad, come on, don't let
there be money in the back.

1808
01:18:16,725 --> 01:18:17,459
And, of course,

1809
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:18,594
--there's money in the back.
--Oh, shit.

1810
01:18:18,594 --> 01:18:21,230
[WARD] Yeah, looks like
Ido have a reason

1811
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:22,898
to kill both of you.

1812
01:18:22,898 --> 01:18:23,265
[gun clicks]

1813
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:24,033
Okay!

1814
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:25,234
You always were a wanker...

1815
01:18:25,234 --> 01:18:26,535
--[TALLY] No!
--[gunshots]

1816
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:29,572
--[MAV] Tally! What did you do?!
--[WARD wailing]

1817
01:18:29,572 --> 01:18:31,607
Wait a minute. No, no! I'm good.

1818
01:18:31,607 --> 01:18:34,310
My family jewels!

1819
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:35,578
[JAKE]
Damn eye patch!

1820
01:18:35,578 --> 01:18:36,545
Jake!

1821
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:38,147
I was aimin' for his knees!

1822
01:18:38,147 --> 01:18:40,950
[WARD whimpering]

1823
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:42,885
He went down like a stag!

1824
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:45,087
[TALLY] How'd you, uh...
How'd you find us?

1825
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:47,256
Oh! I had one more message
from your old man.

1826
01:18:47,256 --> 01:18:48,123
After you found the cabin,

1827
01:18:48,123 --> 01:18:51,427
1 figured you boys
might get lost. And...

1828
01:18:51,427 --> 01:18:52,828
Heard the shootin'
and I thought:

1829
01:18:52,828 --> 01:18:55,331
Good God, maybe they've gone
to killin' each other!

1830
01:18:55,331 --> 01:18:57,099
[WARD cries]

1831
01:18:57,099 --> 01:18:58,901
Play it, yeah.

1832
01:18:58,901 --> 01:19:00,803
--Shut up! Stop whinin'.
--[thuds]

1833
01:19:00,803 --> 01:19:05,407
[WARD]
ow! Ow... Ow...

1834
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:08,611
All right, no jokes this time.

1835
01:19:08,611 --> 01:19:10,012
I know our family's
been a little,

1836
01:19:10,012 --> 01:19:12,514
well... dysfunctional.

1837
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:14,283
But what family isn't?

1838
01:19:14,283 --> 01:19:16,485
By now you know the cabin
and what money I had left

1839
01:19:16,485 --> 01:19:17,786
is yours to split between you.

1840
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:19,989
But what you may not know

1841
01:19:19,989 --> 01:19:22,191
is I didn't just rebuild
Elmer's ranch for him--

1842
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:23,626
I bought it.

1843
01:19:23,626 --> 01:19:26,128
He's been my business
partner ever since.

1844
01:19:26,128 --> 01:19:29,632
It's my hope that you boys
will continue on with it.

1845
01:19:29,632 --> 01:19:30,666
But hell, you're grown men,

1846
01:19:30,666 --> 01:19:32,534
you can do whatever
the hell you like.

1847
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:36,472
[sighs] I'm real proud
of you boys.

1848
01:19:36,472 --> 01:19:37,773
Truth is, I always have been,

1849
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,475
I just didn't know
how to show it.

1850
01:19:39,475 --> 01:19:42,278
All the money and fame in
the world is not worth a dime

1851
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:46,181
if you don't have people
to love and share it with.

1852
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:48,784
Sol leave you with
this one last thought.

1853
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:51,654
It's very simple, just like me.

1854
01:19:51,654 --> 01:19:53,822
love you boys...

1855
01:19:53,822 --> 01:19:57,660
1 always have
and I always will.

1856
01:19:57,660 --> 01:19:58,827
You might not realize it now,

1857
01:19:58,827 --> 01:20:03,465
but you are gonna miss
me when I'm gone...

1858
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:04,533
Now go on out there,

1859
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:06,635
give me a proper Irish funeral.

1860
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:08,971
Everybody gets shit-faced!

1861
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:12,174
This is CM, over and out.

1862
01:20:12,174 --> 01:20:15,542
[TALLY laughs]

1863
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:17,846
>

1864
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:22,017
[MAV]
To Dad, Mom, Colt Jr.

1865
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:23,719
and every single person

1866
01:20:23,719 --> 01:20:25,587
that can't be here
with us right now.

1867
01:20:25,587 --> 01:20:26,822
Here, here!

1868
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:28,654
[ALL]
Here, here!

1869
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:31,160
Ahh!

1870
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,559
Shit...

1871
01:20:33,595 --> 01:20:35,063
Jake, one more thing!

1872
01:20:39,735 --> 01:20:40,736
What's this?

1873
01:20:40,736 --> 01:20:42,338
That is our inheritance.

1874
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:47,176
Three hundred and seventy-five
thousand dollars, cash.

1875
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:49,011
[MAV]
It's for the bank note.

1876
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:51,780
You guys should all have
a place you can call home.

1877
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:53,077
That's right.

1878
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:55,751
1 don't know what to say...

1879
01:20:55,751 --> 01:20:59,244
Eh... Comp us a couple
beers, we'll call it even.

1880
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:04,860
All right, well enough
of this mopey crap, boys.

1881
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,261
Let's have a party, huh?

1882
01:21:06,261 --> 01:21:09,128
[ALL cheer]

1883
01:21:15,938 --> 01:21:17,239
[sCUZZ]
You deserve it, Boss.

1884
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:17,806
[JAKE]
You, too.

1885
01:21:17,806 --> 01:21:19,708
1 got you, buddy! Next game?

1886
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:20,476
[sCUZZ]
I won't punch you!

1887
01:21:20,476 --> 01:21:21,377
[MAV]
I got you.

1888
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:23,879
[TALLY]
Punch him. Somebody needs to.

1889
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:26,871
Okay. I'll be
over therein asec.

1890
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:31,620
Funny seeing you here...

1891
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:33,555
1 didn't think you'd
actually show up.

1892
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:37,126
You sold me a brand new
Harley for 500 bucks!

1893
01:21:37,126 --> 01:21:37,793
[MAV]
Yeah...

1894
01:21:37,793 --> 01:21:39,061
1 thought you might
be dumb enough

1895
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:41,063
to buy it back full retail.

1896
01:21:41,063 --> 01:21:44,333
[MAY laughs]

1897
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:46,068
Can I buy you a drink?

1898
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:47,936
Yeah. Or you could, uh,

1899
01:21:47,936 --> 01:21:50,506
take me for aride
on your Harley...

1900
01:21:50,506 --> 01:21:52,908
Is that a metaphor
for something or...?

1901
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,476
Guess we'll find out...

1902
01:21:54,476 --> 01:21:55,911
[MAV chuckles]

1903
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:56,901
[inaudible]

1904
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,448
[SOFIA]
So...

1905
01:21:59,448 --> 01:22:00,082
Yeah?

1906
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:02,451
What about the restitution?

1907
01:22:02,451 --> 01:22:03,519
Well, hey.

1908
01:22:03,519 --> 01:22:04,486
With a little good behavior,

1909
01:22:04,486 --> 01:22:06,188
I'll be out in six
to twelve months.

1910
01:22:06,188 --> 01:22:08,590
Mmm, good thing they
allow conjugal visits.

1911
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:10,080
Yeah.

01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:43,955
You're close, come on!

1915
01:22:44,827 --> 01:22:45,861
[sCUZZ]
I never could whistle.

1916
01:22:45,861 --> 01:22:47,362
Hey, bro, i-i-it's fine!

1917
01:22:47,362 --> 01:22:49,498
Uh... You know
what you're doing,

1918
01:22:49,498 --> 01:22:51,300
you're makin' a slit,
round your lips

1919
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:54,031
and get a little moisture
on 'em and... [whistles]

1920
01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:57,506
You know, I used to play a
Jew's Harp when I was a kid.
