1
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,060
- So the Irishman,

2
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,780
he sees this beautiful blonde
come walking through the trees

3
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,620
- Yeah.

4
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,080
- And he looks at her and
he says, "Are you game?"

5
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,290
And she says, "Yeah" and
the Polack shoots her.

6
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,500
- That was good!

7
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,770
- Now, that was something big.

8
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,770
Even the crickets stopped.

9
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,560
- Ah, a little squirrel
would sound like Sasquatch

10
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,860
in this underbrush.

11
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,190
- Evening.

12
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,730
- You get yourself killed, boy,

13
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,000
sneaking around like that.

14
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,930
- I'm sorry.

15
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,320
I didn't mean to spook anyone.

16
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,600
- I didn't say we were scared.

17
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,070
I said you might have got hurt.

18
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,060
- What is it we can do
for you there, partner?

19
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,430
- I'm having a little
trouble with my pickup

20
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,710
back on the highway.

21
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,720
Hoping I'd run into somebody'd

22
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,560
know a thing or two about engines.

23
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,700
- What kind of trouble?

24
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,710
- Well, if I knew that,

25
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,630
all due respect,

26
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,300
I wouldn't be stumbling
through the woods at night,

27
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,810
now, would I?

28
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,930
Your fish, it's er,

29
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,010
it's burning.

30
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,480
- Here, take over for me.

31
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,470
Let me see if I can rustle up some tools.

32
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,400
- Well, I don't guess there'd
be another camper around here

33
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,890
for 20 miles, huh?

34
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,000
- I don't guess.

35
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,640
- Well, how long you boys up here for?

36
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,630
Hey.

37
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,030
Hey, hey!

38
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,670
- What in the
holy fuck are you doing?

39
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,480
- Get on the CB.

40
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,230
There's not a highway
close to here for 10 miles.

41
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:56,160
There's not a thing he's
saying that isn't a lie.

42
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,220
You don't know who this is?

43
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,160
It's one of them cons broke
out of Poho this morning.

44
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,580
Ain't that right?

45
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,040
Get the ranger's station.

46
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,870
Do it!

47
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,320
If you can't raise them,
just get anybody out there.

48
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,490
Just tell them that...

49
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,330
Goddammit!

50
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,700
Just come out of there,

51
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,700
up where we can see you.

52
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,350
- Fine, now, look,

53
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,850
I don't know what you boys want,

54
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,370
but we ain't got nothing

55
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,560
and we ain't looking for no trouble.

56
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,480
- Funny sometimes how it
comes looking for you.

57
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,440
- These hills are crawling with troopers.

58
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,900
You can't actually think
they ain't going to find you.

59
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,480
- Well, it's just so
nice to know you care.

60
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,370
- There some kind of reward
for you fellas, or...

61
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,760
- What are you doing, Gary?

62
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,430
The man's got a gun.

63
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,850
- Nobody is doing anything to anybody.

64
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,410
- Then don't be the
first man stupid enough

65
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,330
to make me put a bullet in him.

66
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,350
Now, put that thing down and we can talk.

67
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,180
- Do it.

68
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,250
- Fuck me!

69
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,360
- You'd have been dead.

70
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,980
We'd both be.

71
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,230
In or out?

72
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,480
Simple as that.

73
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,530
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

74
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:16,260
Get these clothes off
'em, let's see what fits.

75
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,950
- Thanks, it's just the one.

76
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:36,930
- You need tickets to a Giants game?

77
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:37,850
- Won't be here long enough.

78
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,930
- Got them close, I got them cheap.

79
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:39,760
How about the opera?

80
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,600
- No, thank you.

81
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,330
- What, you don't like the opera?

82
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,340
Hey, what about Alcatraz?

83
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,460
You wanna go there?

84
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,150
- Reservation for Farraday.

85
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,300
- Delmar J.?

86
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,300
You're already checked in.

87
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,220
Fourth floor, room 412.

88
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,910
Uh, fourth floor, Delmar J.

89
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,290
Anyone might have checked in for you?

90
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,390
- News to me.

91
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,800
- You know any other Delmar J. Farradays?

92
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,020
- Uh, my father stayed here before.

93
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,040
He recommended it to me.

94
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,090
- It may be him.

95
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,160
- He's been in Tacoma
for the last three days.

96
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,490
- Well, whatever happened and why,

97
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,570
let's get a room for you.

98
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,310
Mr. Farraday?

99
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,330
- Dad?

100
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,830
- DJ.

101
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,860
What a surprise.

102
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,740
Jamie, this is my son, Del Jr.

103
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,450
We call him DJ.

104
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,450
- How do you do?

105
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,650
- What are you doing here?

106
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,550
- Just a contract dispute.

107
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,260
- Are you by yourself?

108
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,850
- Yeah.

109
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,770
First time.

110
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,700
Actually, I think they made some kind of

111
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,970
last minute decision on me.

112
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,640
- Never mind, that's great!

113
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,070
If they sent you here by
yourself, that's great!

114
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,320
You kidding me?

115
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,660
- Well, actually, it's uh, just a quickie.

116
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,870
- Jamie's an attorney.

117
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,170
She's working on the property deal

118
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,810
for the restaurant in Tacoma.

119
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,820
- Nice meeting you.

120
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,660
- And you.

121
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,550
- I got to go take care of this thing.

122
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,990
- Deej?

123
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,290
DJ?

124
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:55,210
For Christ's sake, will you wait a second?

125
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,650
Just put everything you're thinking,

126
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:03,770
put it on hold, okay?

127
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,940
For me?

128
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,970
Can you do that?

129
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,080
- Were you in Tacoma at all this week?

130
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,750
- Anything you're
thinking, just wait, okay?

131
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,140
- Were you ever?

132
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,770
- You going to be all right?

133
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:28,850
DJ?

134
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,050
You remember that old sawmill
up on Bryce Ridge up there?

135
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,650
Some developer from
Colorado just bought that.

136
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,250
- What, they're not going to reopen it?

137
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,080
- No.

138
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,920
I think they're going to level it.

139
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,530
- You're kidding me.

140
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,510
Everybody I know who spent
their summers up here

141
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,940
lost their cherry in that old place.

142
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,710
We used to call it Pecker Point.

143
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,820
- Yeah, that's a prime piece of property.

144
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,320
- Surprised you didn't buy it.

145
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,030
- Tell me this isn't happening.

146
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,360
- I don't believe this.

147
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,470
- Goddammit!

148
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,800
What's he doing?

149
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,780
- You've got the shittiest sense of timing

150
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,850
of anybody I know.

151
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,940
- What the hell are you doing here?

152
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,690
- What the hell am I?

153
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,700
- What did he say?

154
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,940
You haven't said a word
to each other since

155
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,790
right here two years ago.

156
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,950
Now, I don't want to sound
like an asshole, Cam,

157
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,770
but you're going to have to go.

158
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:43,840
He's sitting out there in the truck

159
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,140
in as big a shock as you are.

160
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,910
- Hey, unless Dad disowned
me without letting me know,

161
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,220
I'm still a part of this family.

162
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,130
- Bullshit.

163
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,540
Who you got up here?

164
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,230
Is it Billy?

165
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:58,830
You guys having your little
rendezvous up here now?

166
00:12:58,830 --> 00:12:59,660
What are you, crazy?

167
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,580
- Back off!

168
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,110
- Oh, if he takes a swing at you?

169
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,360
- Come running!

170
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:24,390
- Do you just happen up here
whenever you feel like it?

171
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,520
When's the last time you saw your mother?

172
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,520
- Thursday at the Fish.

173
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,290
What, she didn't tell you?

174
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:41,700
- No, I've been out of
town on the Tacoma thing.

175
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,650
You know it hurts her
when you don't drop by

176
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,480
or even call for months at a time.

177
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,820
- You guys up for the weekend?

178
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,010
- I brought your brother up
here to talk some things out.

179
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:59,680
I might as well talk
them out with you, too.

180
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,000
- Is that your way of asking me to stay?

181
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,010
- That's my way of not kicking your ass

182
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:11,090
for being up here in the first place.

183
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,650
- You going to pull some fish out of there

184
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:34,600
or do I have to start my pesto sauce?

185
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,420
- There's a familiar sight.

186
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,760
Dad, the pier, and his beer.

187
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,120
- Your early monster period.

188
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,990
- Yeah, what was it about me

189
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,910
and monsters back then anyway?

190
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,180
- The creature from the gay lagoon.

191
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,940
Remember I used to call you that?

192
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,450
- Catching hell for
it, that's what I remember.

193
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,450
- Dad wasn't pissed, Van Gough.

194
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:42,450
He was hurt that you made
Dracula look like him.

195
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,920
- You know,

196
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,850
some of these planks are
getting kind of thin out here.

197
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,930
- Might have to
put a few new boards down.

198
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,160
- So what's Billy driving these days?

199
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,270
- Now, go ahead.

200
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,110
Come on, just do it.

201
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,620
- I got to see it.

202
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,120
- Christ, Cambell, just do it!

203
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,120
- Like this, Cambo!

204
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,800
- Come on, do it!

205
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,000
Quit being so goddamned afraid!

206
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,680
- Oh!

207
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,510
Ow!

208
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,390
- What are you owing for?

209
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,980
That didn't hurt.

210
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,810
Come on!

211
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:11,900
It wouldn't have hurt if you'd

212
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,060
kept your head down and
you didn't belly flop.

213
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,260
Hey, don't you even start
to think about crying.

214
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,580
You're not hurt.

215
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,730
I want to see a smile on your face.

216
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,330
I said I want to see a smile on that face.

217
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,170
- It hurts!

218
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,000
- I don't care if it hurts.

219
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,520
Smile!

220
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,610
Come on!

221
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,450
No crying!

222
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,500
You heard me!

223
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,720
I said a smile on your face.

224
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,000
You're not coming up out of there

225
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,930
unless you come out of there like a man

226
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,510
and not some pussy!

227
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,050
Your mother and I have had
our troubles over the years.

228
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,740
Just like anybody else.

229
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,150
And sometimes you kids knew about it

230
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,670
and sometimes you didn't.

231
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,800
- I ran into Dad a couple of days ago.

232
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,210
- Like I said, we've had our problems.

233
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,040
- He was with someone.

234
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,950
- Her names is Jamie Cutter.

235
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,740
I met her at one of those
land option reviews in Tacoma.

236
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,820
She's an attorney, like your brother.

237
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,620
It's certainly not easy to sit
and try and say this to you.

238
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:51,450
I've spent a lot of time
thinking about how to say it.

239
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,370
But I kind of need for you guys to,

240
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,920
well, look at me as a person.

241
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,030
You know, not as a man with his two boys,

242
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,570
but the three of us as
men talking this over.

243
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,240
I didn't like the lying, Cambo.

244
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,640
But I didn't know how to tell you.

245
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,970
- You are something else, Pop.

246
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,570
- Come on, Cam.

247
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,530
- How long has this been going on?

248
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,950
- I didn't come up here to go on trial.

249
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,870
Don't think that you're going
to make me the bad guy here

250
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:32,820
just because I happen
to have these feelings.

251
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,790
- Do you hear what you're saying?

252
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,500
Do you hear a word of what
the hell you're saying?

253
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,330
- Look, sit down, Cam!

254
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,570
You're not making this any easier!

255
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,400
- How fucking easy do you want it?

256
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,840
We get to be honorary men tonight,

257
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,680
but only for the privilege
of saying that this is okay?

258
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,880
Is that it, Pop?

259
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,090
The boys will be boys club?

260
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,500
Is that what we are tonight?

261
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,820
Because I want to know
when I have to go back

262
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,500
and be just shitty little Cambell again.

263
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,340
- Watch yourself!

264
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,330
- You haven't told Mom

265
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,000
and you weren't going to tell us either!

266
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,210
- I'm going to let you get pissed

267
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,140
because I realize this has
been a complete shock for--

268
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,160
- Now, if we mattered,

269
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,240
you would have asked us
up here a long time ago.

270
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,300
And if Mom mattered, you wouldn't be

271
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,650
dicking someone else on the side!

272
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,510
- Why don't you go ahead
and lay it all out?

273
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,680
Okay, big man?

274
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,310
Go ahead!

275
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,760
Lay it all out on the line
about how goddamned awful it was

276
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,590
for you to have me for an old man!

277
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,150
Let go of me.

278
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,690
- Dad.

279
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,860
- Good evening.

280
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,910
You're about the only
lights on this mountain.

281
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,240
- Can I do something for you?

282
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,520
- Sorry, my name's Frank.

283
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,250
Frank Dabbo.

284
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,770
- Del Farraday.

285
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:01,700
- My son, Red.

286
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,560
- How are you doing?

287
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,500
- We've got a dead pickup
about a mile and a half

288
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,000
down the two-lane.

289
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,550
- I think we blew a gasket
coming up that incline.

290
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,750
- Been down there since sundown

291
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,810
thinking sooner or later a
car was going to come by.

292
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,680
- No, not on that old road.

293
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,510
- Well, Red finally saw your
smoke and we trailed it here.

294
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,540
All we're looking for is a phone.

295
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,990
- Okay, sure.

296
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:31,820
Come in.

297
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,410
These are my boys.

298
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,800
This is Cambell and that's Del Jr.

299
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,430
We call him DJ.

300
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:44,130
The phone's in through
that door right there.

301
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,880
- Much obliged.

302
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,770
- You fellas must at least be thirsty.

303
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,580
- Oh, please, don't go to any trouble.

304
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,560
- I'm a little hungry.

305
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,190
I'll grab something to
eat, if you've got it.

306
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,930
- Now, what did I just say?

307
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,310
- I just want something to eat.

308
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,170
- Oh, if he's hungry, he's hungry.

309
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,170
That's okay.

310
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,350
DJ?

311
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,340
- I'll check.

312
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,170
- Yeah, I'm in
need of some serious

313
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,780
roadside attention here.

314
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,620
Yeah.

315
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,560
- I'm so hungry I could
eat anything about now.

316
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,150
- We got this.

317
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,660
It's cold, though.

318
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,820
Nothing left to put on it.

319
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,750
- This pesto looks good.

320
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,230
Why don't you relax, man?

321
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,060
You're looking at me like I'm going to

322
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,560
slit your throat or something.

323
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,120
- Your old man hungry?

324
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,720
Your old man, is he hungry?

325
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,770
- Why don't you ask him?

326
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,020
- How come yours is the only cabin

327
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,690
on this side of the lake, Del?

328
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,150
I see lights out across the water,

329
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:30,140
but none over on this side.

330
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,610
- My old man built it before there was

331
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:36,410
a moratorium called on
building on the South Shore.

332
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:37,600
- Lucky for you.

333
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,790
It's nice and quiet on this side.

334
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,560
- Yeah, we like it.

335
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,980
Care for a cigar?

336
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:51,910
- You're going to make a
jealous man out of me here, Del.

337
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,450
Yes, sir, a jealous man indeed.

338
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,280
- Cutter?

339
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,320
- There were three nevers for happiness,

340
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,240
my old man used to say.

341
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,580
Never arm wrestle with a friend,

342
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,020
never turn your back
on a man with a stick,

343
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,770
and never turn down a good cigar.

344
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:23,250
What kind of work are you in, Del?

345
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,570
Must pay pretty to keep
you in a place like this.

346
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,640
- I own a little
restaurant down in the city

347
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,870
called the Blue Fish.

348
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:33,330
It's right on the water in Carlyle Bay.

349
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,630
- Ah!

350
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:35,580
An entrepreneur.

351
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,110
I should have guessed.

352
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,470
- Why is that?

353
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,160
- The way you carry yourself.

354
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,750
- Really?

355
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,420
- Kind of laid back.

356
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,290
No, not in a bad way.

357
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,800
I mean, it's just that
a man who's his own boss

358
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,750
has a different way of carrying himself.

359
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,050
- Well, what I do is a lot less laid back

360
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,600
than you might think.

361
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,960
- I didn't
mean it that way at all.

362
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,480
I'm sure you worked hard
for what you've got.

363
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,000
Get those plates scrubbed up, Red boy.

364
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,840
- No.

365
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,670
Don't bother.

366
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,500
We'll take care of that.

367
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,460
- Well, you've got to let us
do something to earn our keep.

368
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,650
- No, don't be silly.

369
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,650
- Do the dishes for the man.

370
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:14,320
- Well, like he just
said, it was okay, Dad.

371
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:25,090
- You take this buck
down yourself, Del Sr.?

372
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,590
- Uh, no, that was my old man.

373
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,010
He was the hunter in the family.

374
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,140
- I could take down pretty much anything

375
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,980
I pulled a trigger at

376
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:40,230
before I was much older than these two.

377
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,480
- Well, fishing and watching football,

378
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,850
those are my vices now.

379
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:49,680
- Really?

380
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,750
It's funny,

381
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,810
I had you figured for more
of a doer than a watcher.

382
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:57,670
You know what I'm saying?

383
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:00,850
So where do you fit into
all of this Cambell?

384
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,190
The quiet one's usually the smartest.

385
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,410
Am I right?

386
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:09,410
- Well, Cambell's, he's
real sharp, that's for sure.

387
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:13,620
But his older brother,
he's the hotshot attorney.

388
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,450
- No shit.

389
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,160
He's the pain in the ass, am I right?

390
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,990
Cameo?

391
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,000
Don't be afraid to say it.

392
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,500
Big brothers are always a pain in the ass.

393
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,010
Tell me, Del,

394
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,010
you ever uh, arm wrestle?

395
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,070
- Yeah, back in the Navy.

396
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,020
About 40 million beers ago.

397
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,130
- Well, come on.

398
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,890
- What, are you kidding?

399
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,330
- Oh, that's the old
man talking in you, Del.

400
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm talking to the young man in there

401
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,130
before he got too soft and flabby

402
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:51,260
from eating too much at
his own fancy restaurant.

403
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,940
- I'm a lot of beers
away from sitting down

404
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,830
across from you and holding hands.

405
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,800
- Don't pay attention to me.

406
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,330
I'm just a dinosaur with half a brain

407
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,310
slowly sinking into tar.

408
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,550
- Well, why don't you
just sit down, relax,

409
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:09,040
and wait for your tow?

410
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,040
- Done deal.

411
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,970
You boys got to be proud you
got a dad who knows his limits.

412
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,460
I'm not sure old Red
could say that about me.

413
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,860
- You're not going to bait
me into arm wrestling you.

414
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,820
- That's okay, Del.

415
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,140
You just be sure and tell these pups

416
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,970
after we leave how you
know you could have won.

417
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:28,860
- Why don't we just all whip
'em out and see who's biggest?

418
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,890
- Oh, you got the pups
running to the rescue now.

419
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:32,940
- What are you doing?

420
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,910
- There's fighting in
them there words, Del.

421
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,330
- Just let it go.

422
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,840
- Come on.

423
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,750
Anchors aweigh!

424
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,330
- I said let it go.

425
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:58,040
- You are one solid gold pussy.

426
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,200
- What did you say?

427
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,570
I said, what did you say?

428
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,140
- Come on, Dad.

429
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,890
- What are you doing, Dad?

430
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:25,720
- Move.

431
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,550
- You're kidding.

432
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,380
- What are you, 12 years old?

433
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,220
- Cam, move.

434
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,050
Get up.

435
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:29,880
Get up!

436
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,870
- I don't see you showing
much concern over there

437
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,880
for your old man.

438
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,710
- Have at it, daddy-o.

439
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,340
- You know why they call
it Indian wrestling,

440
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,210
don't you, Del?

441
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,580
You ever heard of the Wanapes?

442
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,930
- Wanape.

443
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,640
- Now, I know I just didn't
hear you correct your old man

444
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,390
in front of a bunch of strangers.

445
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,650
Wanape Indians.

446
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:00,430
Wiped out hundreds of years ago.

447
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,760
They used this kind of wrestling

448
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,420
as part of their manhood ritual.

449
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,060
Now, what kind of bullshit
rituals do we have today

450
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:13,060
that lets a pup know he's
grown from a boy to a man?

451
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:13,910
His SATs?

452
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,240
Running a football through
a couple of goalposts?

453
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,240
Going on a vision quest for dirty pictures

454
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,740
on the goddamned information superhighway?

455
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:31,150
The Wanape, they'd set these
boys down to arm wrestle

456
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,930
and under each brave's hand

457
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:36,390
they'd put a live scorpion in a box.

458
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:40,760
And if you lost,

459
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,760
you lost on top of it.

460
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,430
It stung you.

461
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,910
Sometimes, that boy, he'd die.

462
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:48,350
- Ooh, he's psyching you out, Dad.

463
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,390
- I think I know what he's doing.

464
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:53,540
- It wasn't just a random act of cruelty.

465
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,790
The most amazing thing about the Wanape

466
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,870
was their passion for their people.

467
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,300
You ever heard of the manhood dance?

468
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,260
- What has this got to do with anything?

469
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:12,350
- Under the full moon,
after that boy had cried

470
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:17,160
and bled and proved his
courage beyond what he thought

471
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,420
were the boundaries of his mind and body,

472
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:24,840
after his trials by earth,
air, fire, and water,

473
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,650
the father would dance with the son.

474
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,580
The manhood dance was the greatest gift

475
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,780
that a father could give to his boy.

476
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,360
See, because in it,

477
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,580
all the pain and regret

478
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:47,700
between that daddy and his
boy would be danced away.

479
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,350
- Are we going to do this or not?

480
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:53,760
- And I don't mean some
polite kind of two-step, Del.

481
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,850
They danced skin on skin

482
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,470
in a ceremony that today would
topple under an avalanche

483
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,220
of moral indignation.

484
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:08,310
- If I win, you go back to your truck.

485
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,610
- Just imparting some little known history

486
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,440
to you, my friend.

487
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,610
- You go back to your truck
and wait for your tow.

488
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,930
- And if I win?

489
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,550
Count it down for us, boy.

490
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:32,680
- Three.

491
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:35,920
Two.

492
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,030
One.

493
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,950
Go.

494
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,650
- Winner takes all, Del.

495
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,320
How about that?

496
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,570
My life for yours.

497
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,740
If I win, I get your life.

498
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,210
You win, you get mine.

499
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,420
Scorpion bit you, Del.

500
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,990
- Two out of three.

501
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,410
- Ah, come on, Dad.

502
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,400
Let them go back to their truck.

503
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,550
- Knock it off!

504
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,800
Excuse my son.

505
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,630
He's just a little--

506
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,990
- More honest than you like to be?

507
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:59,990
- I mean no one throws anyone
out of this place except me.

508
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,950
- Pack it up, Red boy.

509
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:12,410
Smart man knows when he's
overstayed his welcome.

510
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:14,090
We're going to hike back down.

511
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,240
Tow should be along pretty soon.

512
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,820
Thank you for the hospitality, Del Senior.

513
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,650
Counselor.

514
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,760
Cameo.

515
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,250
- You should have never let them in here.

516
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,760
- What was I supposed to do,
slam the door in their faces?

517
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,120
- I'll be you nothing they
said was on the level.

518
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,990
Father and son, give me a break.

519
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,630
- Get away from that window, both of you.

520
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:47,950
- You know, he was gunning for you, Pop.

521
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,560
He came in here pissed
off at everything you had

522
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,890
and you fell for his bullshit!

523
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,240
- All right!

524
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,550
We're done with this!

525
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:57,720
- You got nothing to prove to me, Pop.

526
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,070
- You okay, Pop?

527
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:09,230
I mean...

528
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,040
Why'd you even do it, Pop?

529
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,210
It was stupid.

530
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:14,980
Not you, Pop.

531
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,620
The shit he was trying to pull.

532
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:20,120
- You weren't even supposed to be up here.

533
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,770
- Where is he?

534
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:54,220
- Pouting.

535
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:58,050
Since when does he let you smoke weed?

536
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,160
- Since tonight.

537
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,480
All bets are off tonight.

538
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,040
Everybody's on their worst behavior.

539
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,960
- I'm gone.

540
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,380
- Do you know how hard
it was for him to tell us

541
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,190
what he told us in there tonight?

542
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,620
- As hard as it was for
him to lie to us about it

543
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,750
'til you caught him with his pants down?

544
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,980
- Oh, come on, Cam.

545
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,330
Look, I'm the one that
found him sneaking around

546
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:20,670
like a 10 year old.

547
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,790
You should have seen the look on his face.

548
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,070
It looked like he'd been shot.

549
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:25,160
- Yeah, well he was!

550
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,830
He died right there!

551
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,100
Every bullshit lesson he
crammed down our throats

552
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,600
turned to shit in that moment.

553
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,000
He held us up our whole
lives to some bullshit code

554
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,540
that now we find out couldn't
even live up to himself.

555
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,220
- Oh, you think he went and
found something on the side

556
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,220
because everything was so great at home?

557
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,780
- What, now it's Mom's fault?

558
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,650
- It's bigger than Dad being the bad guy,

559
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,750
that's all I'm saying.

560
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:53,340
You want to nail him to
a cross, don't use Mom.

561
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,240
This is about Billy.

562
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,150
So make it about Billy.

563
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,920
Is he still coming?

564
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,440
This whole weekend is
just another little battle

565
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,090
in the war against Dad.

566
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,280
You're up here sneaking around with Billy

567
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,110
like some chickenshit little brat.

568
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,610
- Billy's dead.

569
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,160
He died a year ago.

570
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,610
I guess he didn't fight it much

571
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:34,310
or take his meds or something

572
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,220
'cause you can beat it now if you try.

573
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,050
I just got to think he didn't try.

574
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,170
- Tell me you got tested.

575
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,000
- I got tested.

576
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,080
I'm not sick.

577
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,210
We're not talking about me, okay?

578
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,720
Billy died alone in some place
where no one even knew him.

579
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,430
- He what?

580
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,480
- After Dad pulled his little
stunt here that Christmas,

581
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,980
Billy disappeared.

582
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,260
- What are you trying to say?

583
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,620
- I'm saying Billy ditched me, his life,

584
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,730
and everything else after that

585
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:23,140
'cause I never saw him again.

586
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,020
Three weeks went by and his idiot parents

587
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:30,270
didn't even want to report him missing.

588
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,020
I spent months looking for him.

589
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:42,210
All those places he always
talked about moving to.

590
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,350
10 months went by and I had to find out

591
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,270
from someone else he was even dead.

592
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,810
He got sick, Deej, but he never came home.

593
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,210
Can you believe that?

594
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,370
He never came home.

595
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,950
- You got to tell Dad what happened.

596
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,280
- The hell I do.

597
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,910
- He is sorry, you know.

598
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:19,250
- He can't even say Billy's name.

599
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,400
- Because sometimes you do
something that's so horrible

600
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,070
you don't know how to apologize.

601
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:41,570
Billy's not the only one
that ran away that night.

602
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,230
You and Dad ran away from each other.

603
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,550
- No!

604
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,190
No, I walked away.

605
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,600
And let me tell you
something, big brother,

606
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,920
I walked away because
that night if I didn't,

607
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,120
I might have killed my own father.

608
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,790
- Maybe I would have, too.

609
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:03,990
- Dad never
would have done that to you

610
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:07,070
or anybody you brought to this house.

611
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,260
- Pack it in.

612
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,290
- I got news for you, Pop.

613
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,100
No one's leaving here until
the three of us sit down

614
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,430
and settle this.

615
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:25,580
- Don't talk to me like
I'm some goddamned client!

616
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,250
You got something to straighten
out with your brother,

617
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,840
ride back with him.

618
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,930
You, get your stuff.

619
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,140
And I don't ever want
to see you up here again

620
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,920
without my say-so.

621
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,250
- Is this the arm wrestling?

622
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:40,350
Is this Cam or Frank or
just you don't want to

623
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:43,040
finish what we came up here to finish?

624
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,130
- Who are you talking to?

625
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,100
- What is this?

626
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:57,100
The first time the three of us
have been alone in how long?

627
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,450
I don't tell you how to do much, Pop.

628
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,070
- You're goddamned right you don't.

629
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:04,430
- But you're fucking
this up something royal.

630
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,150
- Don't think I won't
knock you on your ass!

631
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:14,340
You think you're smarter
than me all of a sudden?

632
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,710
- I'm through with you.

633
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,840
I'm through with the both of you.

634
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,030
I'm through sticking up for Cam
when you're shutting him out

635
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,240
and I'm through sticking up for you

636
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,650
when he's doing the same thing.

637
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,710
- No one told you to take sides.

638
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,770
- He's right about one thing, Pop.

639
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,050
You shut him down.

640
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:32,750
You shut him out over and over.

641
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:33,670
- Bullshit.

642
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,230
- I watched you do it.

643
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:37,280
- Christ, now you sound like your mother!

644
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,360
- I liked it.

645
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,530
I liked you shutting him out

646
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,410
because every time you did,

647
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,790
it was me you pulled closer.

648
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:47,220
- Oh, what does that mean?

649
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:50,640
- That you're a hard man
to get close to, Pop.

650
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,040
And maybe you think I'm
crazy for saying this,

651
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,800
but the thing I was
afraid of most back then

652
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,510
is that someday you'd start to
treat me like you did Cambo.

653
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:03,280
Maybe you didn't just come out and say it,

654
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,600
but in every way you
could, you made him think

655
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,040
that what he felt was a mistake

656
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,210
and that there was
something wrong with him.

657
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:10,140
- Well, maybe there is.

658
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,430
- Then you'd better learn
the difference between

659
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:14,030
something being wrong and
something being different.

660
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:14,860
- You listen to me, hotshot!
- Because I know

661
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,700
you're not that stupid.

662
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,410
- Listen to me!

663
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:18,950
You got a hell of a lot
of living left to do

664
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:23,380
before you can tell me what
to do and how to do it!

665
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,630
- Billy's dead.

666
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,290
Did you know that?

667
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,060
Cam never saw him after
that night up here.

668
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,000
Are you listening now?

669
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:42,400
You got to talk to him, Pop.

670
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,510
Please talk to him.

671
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,640
- You look like you were
planning on quite a stay.

672
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,560
- Not here.

673
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,580
I was just stopping off here.

674
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,670
I mean it, I'm not lying.

675
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:26,480
- I don't know what to say about Billy.

676
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,390
You weren't going to tell me?

677
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:34,970
- I just want out of here, Pop.

678
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:39,170
- It must have been awful.

679
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:41,880
I can't imagine how awful.

680
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,330
- You don't know what awful is.

681
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:52,830
- I want to hear that you know

682
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:57,060
that I didn't make him go away.

683
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,720
And that I didn't make him sick.

684
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,730
- I know.

685
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:15,200
- So what's doing here?

686
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,770
Another disappearing act?

687
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:20,320
- Tell me you give a shit, Pop.

688
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,790
- No.

689
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:24,150
I'm going to tell you I
want you to take your things

690
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:26,480
and throw them back in here.

691
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:31,550
Whatever you were planning,
Cam, just forget it.

692
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,280
I want you to stay.

693
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:40,210
Stay and let's have a real weekend.

694
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:42,550
You and me and your brother.

695
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,610
You know,

696
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:51,130
I don't really think
that's going to kill us.

697
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:51,960
Do you?

698
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,250
- Man,

699
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:10,760
I'd give five years

700
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,920
to have any one of the summers

701
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,370
we had up here when we were kids.

702
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:20,610
- All I remember is getting
poison oak on my dick.

703
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:24,350
- And on everyone else's.

704
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:32,760
Billy was a good guy.

705
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:40,380
You guys were good for each other.

706
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,960
- What do you mean?

707
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:46,780
- That I know how much he meant to you.

708
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:47,610
- Do you?

709
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:54,910
- I never had a problem with
you being you, little bro.

710
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:02,330
- Hey, bro.

711
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,570
It's good seeing you again.

712
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:30,920
- Don't do this.

713
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,150
- Go back to bed.

714
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:34,110
- This is a window.

715
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:36,830
A window opened tonight.

716
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:38,060
Nothing's going to get better

717
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,110
unless you hang around
and make it that way.

718
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:41,510
- Nothing's going to get better!

719
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:42,610
- That's bullshit.

720
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:43,700
- Stay away from me, Deej!

721
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:44,660
- Dad loves you.

722
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,320
And if he can't show
it in any regular way,

723
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,580
then just recognize that and move on.

724
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,160
- I'm moving on.

725
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,810
- Sneaking around in
the middle of the night?

726
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:53,890
Having some secret life?

727
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:55,750
Don't you see who that is?

728
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:56,580
- Stay away, Deej.

729
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,420
- You're not doing this.

730
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,270
- Stay away from the car.

731
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:01,270
Stay away from the car!

732
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:02,920
Deej!

733
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,230
- Who's in there?

734
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:06,230
- Walk away.

735
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:09,730
- Who's in the car?

736
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:10,600
- Walk away.

737
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,940
Walk away, Deej!

738
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:15,400
- Too late for that now.

739
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,520
- Oh.

740
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:34,670
I can't believe I'm seeing this.

741
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,130
- Go back, Pop.

742
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:43,510
Go back inside, Pop!

743
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:46,990
What are you doing?

744
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:50,800
- Billy's dead.

745
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,310
So if Billy's dead, then
who were you up here

746
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:54,640
waiting to meet?

747
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,300
- My God.

748
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:05,610
If there was a picture of
awkward in the dictionary.

749
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:07,520
- You weren't supposed to be here, Pop!

750
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,190
This has nothing to do with you.

751
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,310
This has nothing to do with you or Dad.

752
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,300
Make him understand, Deej.

753
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,190
- Where you going, counselor?

754
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:26,780
I think it's time we had a
serious heart to heart here.

755
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:29,700
We've been real polite up till now.

756
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:39,650
Take a walk back down that road,
make sure it's still clear.

757
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,370
- We already checked the roads--

758
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:42,450
- Your lack of fucking enthusiasm

759
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:46,320
is really starting to piss me off here!

760
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,070
Don't worry about him.

761
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:58,900
He had to come.

762
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,110
Our real problem is up there.

763
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:01,190
- It didn't have to be.

764
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:02,510
- He saw us in the car.

765
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:03,350
It was over.

766
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:05,250
- I mean knocking on that door.

767
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:08,480
Fucking with the old man like that.

768
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,530
Why didn't you just stay out here?

769
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:10,860
I was working it out.

770
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:13,060
- Just wait out here
a little while longer?

771
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:15,230
Just sit down and watch the sun go down

772
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:17,590
on our second night out?

773
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:19,940
I waited as long as I could, Cameo,

774
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,620
and I spent most of that
time trying to figure out

775
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:25,720
exactly when you decided
to double-cross me.

776
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,520
Now, I need you to go in there

777
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,830
and tell them exactly what is going on.

778
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:31,740
It is the only way now.

779
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:40,190
You don't think these hills
are crawling with troopers?

780
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:42,830
They are going to show up here
just like we talked about.

781
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:46,150
That means we got to know now
exactly how much your daddy

782
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:50,430
and the counselor are
willing to stick by you.

783
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:52,660
- What are you trying to say?

784
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:55,330
You think they might turn me in?

785
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,400
No way, Frank

786
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,660
- Get in there.

787
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:01,360
- No, you're crazy if you think
that's what they'd ever do.

788
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,000
- Show me you can handle this, Cameo,

789
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,110
or I'm going to have to.

790
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,870
- This whole thing was a lie?

791
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:33,300
Everything you said?

792
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,640
- I felt like shit, okay?

793
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,820
- Everything you said when
they were here was a lie?

794
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:41,170
You knew them and you
pretended you didn't?

795
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:42,420
- I know Frank.

796
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,610
I don't know Red.

797
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:47,260
- I don't care.

798
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:49,390
I want you gone.

799
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:52,740
- I got to tell you something, Dad.

800
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,210
This whole thing is going to
get a hell of a lot worse,

801
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:56,130
so you better sit down.

802
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,580
Frank escaped from Poho two days ago.

803
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:16,330
I guess Red helped him.

804
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:17,460
- You mean the prison?

805
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:18,300
Christ!

806
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,960
- They were inmates.

807
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:23,970
They were going to move up
the mountain and into Canada.

808
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:26,640
- What the hell does
this have to do with you?

809
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,480
How do you know Frank?

810
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:32,590
- I met him at Billy's a few years ago.

811
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,060
He was a friend of the family.

812
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:36,610
- Jesus Christ!

813
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:37,580
- Look, after Billy died,

814
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:41,450
I wrote to anyone who could
tell me what happened.

815
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:43,390
Frank was one of them.

816
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:46,340
Only when I found out he went to prison,

817
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,360
I learned how to get in touch with him

818
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,600
and I started writing him.

819
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,610
- You trade letters
with some guy in prison

820
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,880
and all of a sudden you're
just sitting out here

821
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,840
waiting for him to bust out?

822
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,100
- I've been writing to
him for over a year.

823
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,810
Just let me finish.

824
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:01,430
- Finish by telling me that
you're not aiding and abetting

825
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:04,580
two escaped felons because
one of them knew Billy.

826
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:05,990
You tell me that.

827
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:11,860
- There's nothing I can say
that'll make you understand.

828
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:14,280
- You got that right.

829
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,990
- You think I didn't check him out?

830
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:19,760
I got copies of anything
that had to do with him, Pop.

831
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,010
I mean his police records and anything.

832
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,860
He buried some money up here.

833
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:37,320
Frank ran a con game where
he burned guys for fake dope.

834
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,400
Frank never sold dope.

835
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,560
Says it killed both his brothers,

836
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:45,560
so he made a career out of
ripping off the dealers.

837
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,880
- And you believe him?

838
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,640
- One of his scams went seriously south.

839
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,730
He had to bury a lot of money

840
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:53,520
and was going to disappear until they

841
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,010
threw him in prison on something else.

842
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:56,180
- Where is it?

843
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:59,420
Where's the money?

844
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,040
- Bryce Ridge.

845
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,190
- He buried it at the old mill.

846
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:04,250
- They already closed it down

847
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:06,040
- Yeah, but now
they're tearing it down.

848
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:06,870
So he has to get in there

849
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:09,520
and get it before somebody
else does, is that it?

850
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,600
- There's already a skeleton crew up there

851
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,150
prepping for demolition.

852
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:15,450
Frank can't just stroll
in there and pick it up.

853
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:16,550
But I can.

854
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:17,770
- You're his fucking bag man?

855
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:19,640
- I'm a familiar face
that can walk in there

856
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,730
and get what's his, Deej.

857
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:24,750
We were going to just dig in up here

858
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:26,560
until things cooled off.

859
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,360
- You know, what the hell
left a hole in you so big

860
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:32,510
that you just stopped giving a goddamn?

861
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:34,030
- Look, there's still a
way that this can work.

862
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:36,030
- Frank just put you away for five to ten.

863
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:37,380
- You know, that's funny
'cause he's out there right now

864
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,410
thinking that my family is so stone cold

865
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:41,370
they'd let that happen.

866
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:44,970
- If we don't, we're accessories, too.

867
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:47,720
Have you ever thought about that?

868
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:53,210
How much money we talking about?

869
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:54,640
You don't even know, do you?

870
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,870
- You think I'm in this for the money?

871
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:59,320
- I can't for the life of me
figure what you're in this for.

872
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,660
You lose Billy and now you
wind here with this guy?

873
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:03,490
- No.

874
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:06,980
No, that guy is for me.

875
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,750
Frank is for me.

876
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:16,180
That's Cambell's chickenshit
way of saying "Fuck you, Dad."

877
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,170
Isn't it?

878
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:19,000
- Where you going?

879
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:19,840
- Dad?

880
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:20,670
Dad? Dad?

881
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:21,740
- Just stay right there!

882
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:23,210
- Dad, we should all talk together.

883
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:24,670
- Don't move or I'll break your neck.

884
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:25,510
- Dad, just listen to me!

885
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:29,530
- Don't let that
scorpion bite you again, now.

886
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:30,430
- What are you doing?

887
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:33,790
- This time his sting is a motherfucker.

888
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:36,590
- Let's just cut the bullshit.

889
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:38,360
Just tell me, bottom line,

890
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:41,960
what I have to do to get you out of here!

891
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,000
- Is that what you are now, Del Senior?

892
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:45,940
A bottom line man?

893
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:46,950
- Get away from him!

894
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,200
- Forget the kid, forget the talk,

895
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,710
just tell me what the
bottom line is, is that it?

896
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:53,380
You think I'm some white
trash piece of shit

897
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:56,220
you can just sweep off your back porch?

898
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,050
Is that what you mean?

899
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:03,300
Because make no mistake,
I am not that man.

900
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:07,780
I am in deep with you, Del.

901
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:13,780
I'm in so deep I know more
things you've done than you do.

902
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:17,360
Things you've already tried to forget.

903
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:21,250
We have to tie them up.

904
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:22,890
- What?

905
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:24,440
- We need some rope or duct tape.

906
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,110
- No, we're not tying them up!

907
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:28,980
- We have to control this situation.

908
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,490
Now, you can either help,

909
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:33,490
or this can get a whole lot simpler.

910
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:37,140
Rope or duct tape?

911
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:40,180
- Jesus Christ, Cam, just go get it.

912
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:41,190
- Over in the boathouse.

913
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:42,190
- Go get it.

914
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:48,410
Keep an eye on him.

915
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,020
- You don't think I see what you're doing?

916
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:57,200
- I don't think you see shit, papa.

917
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,320
You think I wrote that boy
letters from the big house

918
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:04,550
and talked him into
being my special friend?

919
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:05,710
He came to me.

920
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:07,970
- You knew Billy.

921
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,580
You think there's any other reason

922
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:13,460
Cam would write somebody in prison?

923
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:14,790
- Why, because you wouldn't?

924
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:16,390
- Because I know my son.

925
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:18,140
- But the son rebels.

926
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,210
Maybe the father's a coward.

927
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:24,960
The boy may be brave.

928
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,220
And if the father's a fighter,

929
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,780
the boy may be a lover.

930
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:35,100
- You really think you can
turn my own son against me?

931
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,540
- No.

932
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,460
Only one man can do that.

933
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:42,930
- You need to fall apart, man,

934
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:45,430
this is not the time to do it.

935
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:48,300
- Why didn't Frank say he
was coming with someone?

936
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,660
- This is breaking out of a state prison,

937
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:51,270
you get that, right?

938
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:52,340
- You think I'm an idiot?

939
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:54,320
- I don't know.

940
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:57,770
Did you invite anyone
else up for the weekend?

941
00:56:57,770 --> 00:56:59,130
Frank needed my help to get here.

942
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:00,560
That makes me part of the equation now.

943
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,530
- And he didn't tell me?

944
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:03,070
- He didn't tell you a lot of things.

945
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:04,220
You know how to use one of these?

946
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,060
- Jesus Christ!

947
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,490
What's with all the goddamned guns?

948
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:07,770
Frank said there weren't going to be any--

949
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:09,450
- Anything you thought this
was going to be has changed,

950
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:10,700
all right, Cam?

951
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:13,380
You see that boat there?

952
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:16,060
How fast can you row
that thing out of here?

953
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,340
- What the hell does that mean?

954
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,770
- It means you learn a lot about someone

955
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:19,850
when you live on top of them

956
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:22,680
in a nine by nine box for a while.

957
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,180
- You were Frank's cellmate?

958
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:30,350
- Don't you mean was I more than that?

959
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:34,050
Is that why you think I'm here?

960
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:34,890
- That or the money.

961
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:37,220
- Let me tell you something.

962
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:41,830
I risked everything to get out here

963
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:43,640
and it wasn't to be Frank's boyfriend

964
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:46,990
or move off to Canada
to live the good life.

965
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:48,140
- Yeah, whatever.

966
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:49,940
- I'd really like to
educate you right now, Cam,

967
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,980
but the way you're acting,
you're going to get me, you,

968
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:55,860
your brother, your father,
every-fucking-body killed,

969
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:56,690
all right?

970
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:57,520
- Frank's not killing anybody.

971
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,470
- Just think about it for five seconds.

972
00:57:58,470 --> 00:57:59,800
- Back off, man.

973
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:07,770
- You see a time when
you can take that boat,

974
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:09,970
you take it, okay?

975
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:12,170
Take it and get out of here.

976
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:15,290
You think you can remember that?

977
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:18,870
I'm talking about saving
your ass now, Cam.

978
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:23,520
You're not dumb, you're scared.

979
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,720
Right now it's the same thing.

980
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,880
Figure it out.

981
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:35,900
Just how much of what I have
to tell you can you handle?

982
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:57,920
- Cameo hikes up the ridge,

983
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,710
takes care of business
first thing in the morning.

984
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:01,550
- He's out there in shock

985
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:02,960
that we're even tying these two up.

986
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,260
He goes to the mill
looking like he does now,

987
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,390
he's going to stick out
worse than we would.

988
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:07,860
- Listen, if it's sending someone up there

989
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:10,410
that won't raise an eyebrow, then send me.

990
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:12,210
I built this place with
my old man 30 years ago.

991
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:13,160
I've been a fixture around here

992
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,990
a lot longer than either of my kids.

993
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:18,590
- Nobody's helping this
sack of shit out, Pop.

994
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:20,170
Are you kidding me?

995
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:23,710
- You're a brave little boy,
all tied up like you are.

996
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:26,060
- Oh, you think you know my brother?

997
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:27,860
I know him like nobody else.

998
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,910
- Then you know he
thinks you're an asshole.

999
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:33,340
- Cam's great at playing stupid.

1000
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:35,280
And you can bet your ass
he's playing it with you.

1001
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,870
- Knock it off, DJ.

1002
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:40,930
- You really want to help out, Daddy Del?

1003
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:42,600
You got a cellphone?

1004
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:45,560
- Upstairs on the dresser.

1005
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:46,390
- It work up here?

1006
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:47,900
- Yes, it does.

1007
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:48,740
- Get it.

1008
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:56,910
- What do you want a cellphone for?

1009
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,730
- Peace of mind.

1010
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:20,770
You're going to make it, Cameo.

1011
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:28,520
No matter what you're thinking,
you're going to make it.

1012
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,330
- We got to talk.

1013
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:31,600
- Shoot.

1014
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,020
- Not back there.

1015
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:37,260
- All right.

1016
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,330
Let's have it.

1017
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:43,250
- Come here.

1018
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:51,040
- Well, why don't you
meet me halfway, big man?

1019
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,810
- We don't hurt them, Frank.

1020
01:00:56,810 --> 01:00:58,950
- But we scare the a little,
'cause they need to be scared.

1021
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:00,260
- You pulled a gun on my dad!

1022
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:04,250
- And all you had to do was be here alone!

1023
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:06,260
- You really think I
figured him being here?

1024
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:07,660
- Maybe.

1025
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:08,650
- Come on, Frank.

1026
01:01:08,650 --> 01:01:12,300
- Maybe somewhere in that
pretty little head of yours

1027
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,550
you were hoping he'd be here.

1028
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:15,670
- He never comes up this early.

1029
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:16,500
The only reason he's here now

1030
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:19,830
is 'cause DJ caught him with some woman.

1031
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:25,510
I need to know who you are, Frank.

1032
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,360
Who are you?

1033
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:35,710
- You having second thoughts now, Cameo?

1034
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:37,290
You thinking twice?

1035
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:45,630
'Cause I am exactly what
you thought was coming.

1036
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:50,340
You think I'm something different?

1037
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:51,170
Then you just let me know

1038
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:54,090
what you'd like to have happen here

1039
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:58,750
and we can get down to it right now.

1040
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:01,140
Is that what we're talking about here?

1041
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:01,970
Hmm?

1042
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:08,310
- That's someone up on the road.

1043
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:11,650
We saw you drive through this afternoon.

1044
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:14,330
If they get past the trespass sign,

1045
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:15,780
they're just headed for the highway.

1046
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:18,030
- Well, what if they don't?

1047
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:22,960
It's got to be troopers.

1048
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,210
- Just hold on.

1049
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:30,200
Shit!

1050
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,030
- What?

1051
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:31,870
- Just get back inside!

1052
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:41,610
- Untie them! Now!

1053
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:42,770
- What?

1054
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:43,610
- We're going to have company.

1055
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:44,830
- You got to be shitting me.

1056
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:46,320
- Who the hell else
would be coming up here?

1057
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,160
- Back off, Frank.

1058
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:49,060
- I said, do you know who it is?

1059
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:50,570
'Cause if you don't want to make them dead

1060
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:52,010
and you, too, you know
what needs to happen here.

1061
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:53,210
- Why don't we just stick them upstairs?

1062
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:55,850
- His car is parked outside, stupid.

1063
01:02:55,850 --> 01:02:57,760
Now, are you going to make
this happen for us here,

1064
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:58,690
Del, or what?

1065
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:00,110
- He'll do it.

1066
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,690
Pop, just tell him.

1067
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:04,670
- You're going to do all the talking.

1068
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:07,540
We're going to be outside, close by.

1069
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:09,650
If it's troopers, they might
want to check this place out.

1070
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:11,550
We can't be in here if they do.

1071
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:14,900
Now, Cambell, you go
upstairs, look sleepy.

1072
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:15,890
The car's registered to you.

1073
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:16,940
You need to be in here.

1074
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:18,530
You, you're coming with us.

1075
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:20,360
- Oh, no you don't!

1076
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:22,140
- You go fuck yourself!

1077
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:23,720
- DJ, what are you doing?

1078
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,320
- You want to shoot, then shoot!

1079
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:26,960
I hope they hear it nice and loud!

1080
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:27,790
- You sit down!

1081
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:30,110
You tell them about us,

1082
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:33,360
you do anything to send us back inside,

1083
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:35,530
and you just remember whose baby brother

1084
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:37,610
goes right along with us.

1085
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,780
You just remember that, Counselor.

1086
01:03:53,110 --> 01:03:54,340
- All right, get upstairs, both of you!

1087
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:55,170
Quick!

1088
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:02,630
- That son of a bitch.

1089
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:07,570
- Mr. Farraday?

1090
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,010
Geoff Dixon.

1091
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:13,410
I don't know if you remember me or not.

1092
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:14,240
- Oh, yeah.

1093
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,080
Sure, Geoff.

1094
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:16,610
Uh, how's your dad?

1095
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:18,140
- Probably want to kick our asses

1096
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:19,690
for waking you at this hour.

1097
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:20,650
- Did you hear
about the trouble up north

1098
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:22,480
yesterday, Mr. Farraday?

1099
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,820
There was a prison
break up in Poho County.

1100
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:26,920
A couple of them drove right out the gate

1101
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:29,980
in a prison milk truck,
if you can believe that.

1102
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:32,100
- Poho County,
that's a long way away.

1103
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,710
- Yes, sir, it is, but they
found the truck yesterday

1104
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:35,720
at a filling station down the mountain.

1105
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:38,410
That's William Roy Tenney, 25.

1106
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:41,190
Been in and out of the joint
pretty much all his life.

1107
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:42,270
Mostly drugs.

1108
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:45,030
- That's Frank Dabbo.

1109
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:46,760
Pretty serious character.

1110
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:49,540
The fact is, he was going
to be paroled in 10 months.

1111
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:52,620
Why he pulled this is a big mystery.

1112
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:54,460
- Who you got up here with you?

1113
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:55,800
- My boys.

1114
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:58,920
- DJ and Cambo?

1115
01:04:58,920 --> 01:04:59,990
- Yeah.

1116
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:01,070
- Haven't seen those two up here

1117
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:03,910
since we were all little water-rats.

1118
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:05,240
Tell them I said hi.

1119
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:06,900
And be sure they know the skinny.

1120
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:07,730
- I will.

1121
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:09,990
- Sorry to bother you.

1122
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:11,820
- You know they got a
wrecking crew starting up

1123
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:13,550
at the old mill.

1124
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:15,830
Can you believe that old
place is coming down?

1125
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:19,420
Makes you think there's
nothing that won't.

1126
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:45,170
- Get back up the stairs!

1127
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:46,620
- What are you doing, Dad?

1128
01:05:47,450 --> 01:05:48,280
What?

1129
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,080
- Dad?

1130
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,280
- Get back up the stairs!

1131
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:55,430
- What are we doing?

1132
01:05:58,330 --> 01:05:59,830
What are we doing?

1133
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,480
- Pull all the window shades down.

1134
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,420
Hurry up!

1135
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:05,520
Help him, Cam.

1136
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,090
- Now, I know this
didn't get locked on purpose.

1137
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:18,010
- Dad, what the hell are you doing?

1138
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:21,830
- You got to
play the big man, Del?

1139
01:06:21,830 --> 01:06:25,250
You think you can change the bottom line?

1140
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:31,010
This is not going to end 'cause
you say it does, Daddy Del.

1141
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:37,860
- You get your asses away from here!

1142
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:40,960
Take your money and your sick sidekick

1143
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:44,640
and get your sorry asses up to Canada.

1144
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,730
- Just that simple, huh, Del?

1145
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:51,070
- We don't see you again.

1146
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:51,900
That's the deal.

1147
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:55,430
That way Cambell is
protected and so are you.

1148
01:06:55,430 --> 01:06:58,390
- But see, this isn't
between you and me, poppa.

1149
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:01,060
This is between me and Cameo.

1150
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:02,390
Isn't it, Cameo?

1151
01:07:04,130 --> 01:07:05,130
Let me save you some time

1152
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:08,130
and tell you what happens now, okay?

1153
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,700
Little boy freaks out
because all of a sudden

1154
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,120
daddy's watching.

1155
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:17,450
So little boy fucks over Frank

1156
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:20,340
and everything they had planned.

1157
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:23,230
The irony here is that
little boy decides to

1158
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:26,640
flush the guy who did not
fuck him over his entire life

1159
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,480
right down the toilet.

1160
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:33,590
Because with daddy out here,
he feels 10 years old again.

1161
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:36,030
Like some dirty little faggot
who has to bow his head

1162
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:40,390
and apologize for who he is
whenever his old man's around!

1163
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:43,410
- I'm giving you one
more chance to end this

1164
01:07:43,410 --> 01:07:45,710
without anyone getting hurt.

1165
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:47,950
- Oh, you think you're going
to hurt somebody, Daddy Del?

1166
01:07:55,470 --> 01:07:56,540
- Dad!

1167
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,710
- I can play the same
game as you, Daddy Del,

1168
01:08:03,710 --> 01:08:05,710
only a whole lot better.

1169
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:10,420
I'm only going to wait so long, Cameo.

1170
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,960
You got 10 minutes to say your goodbyes,

1171
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,800
get your head out of wherever it is,

1172
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:16,600
and remember what we're out here to do!

1173
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:34,400
- They're moving back into the woods.

1174
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,060
- You going to kill them
both in cold blood, Pop?

1175
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:38,330
Is that the plan now?

1176
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:39,170
- You think I was going to let them

1177
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:40,020
walk out of here with you?

1178
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:40,860
- You only fired 'cause

1179
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:44,110
every goddamned thing he said was true.

1180
01:08:49,870 --> 01:08:52,790
- Just give me one reason.

1181
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:57,400
One reason why you think this
guy has any feelings for you.

1182
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,320
I'm asking.

1183
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:01,260
- His letters, Deej.

1184
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:02,450
- Get serious.

1185
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:04,180
- They were for real.

1186
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:05,790
- You can hide behind words.

1187
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:06,660
- Give me some credit.

1188
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:08,400
- I twist them and change them every day.

1189
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,530
It's part of my job.

1190
01:09:10,530 --> 01:09:11,860
- He knew, Deej.

1191
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:15,850
He knew what it was like to be me.

1192
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:20,270
I told Frank everything about me.

1193
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:21,710
Everything.

1194
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:25,090
And all he said was tell me more.

1195
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:29,800
Tell me more and never
think that I would run away.

1196
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,260
You find someone like that,

1197
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:32,560
you think you care about where they are

1198
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,710
or what mistakes they've made?

1199
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:37,300
No, you fuck the world and anything else

1200
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:38,450
that gets in your way,

1201
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:41,260
but you grab onto them
tight and you don't let go.

1202
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:44,850
- You honestly think
that Frank's that man?

1203
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,170
- This is over.

1204
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:51,930
The three of us head down the mountain

1205
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:54,460
and we never say a thing
to anyone about this.

1206
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:55,880
None of us, ever.

1207
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:01,080
- We walk out there, we may
never make it to the truck.

1208
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:02,440
- Well, we got to try.

1209
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:03,580
- They have a gun.

1210
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:04,840
- So do we.

1211
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,210
- What are we, commandos?

1212
01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:07,700
- Well, do you have a better idea?

1213
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:08,740
Better idea than sitting in here

1214
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:09,850
until they come in and get us?

1215
01:10:09,850 --> 01:10:11,710
Because believe me, they will.

1216
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:12,790
- They won't.

1217
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,530
- What makes you say that?

1218
01:10:18,690 --> 01:10:20,520
- I'm going with them.

1219
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:25,810
That was the plan.

1220
01:10:25,810 --> 01:10:28,180
That's what I came up here to do.

1221
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:29,800
- Hate me for what I did to Billy

1222
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,410
or hate me for this woman,

1223
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:32,310
but for Christ's sake,

1224
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:34,810
don't use me as a reason
not to have your life!

1225
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:37,810
- You never had respect for my life!

1226
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:40,440
You think you were beating
on Billy that Christmas here,

1227
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:41,670
Dad, but you weren't.

1228
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:43,590
You were beating on me.

1229
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:47,220
For everything you ever
wanted to beat on me about.

1230
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:50,220
Everything about me that wasn't you.

1231
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,400
- Nobody ever learned
without making mistakes, Cam.

1232
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,360
Take that away from me and--

1233
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,920
- You never said it was a mistake!

1234
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,940
After that night, I took
everything you hated about me

1235
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:01,930
and I slammed myself with it so hard

1236
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:02,990
I couldn't even pick up the phone

1237
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:06,330
and give Billy a reason not to run away.

1238
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:09,320
I lost him, Pop.

1239
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:14,390
Billy's my problem.

1240
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:15,800
So are these two.

1241
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:22,220
- You want to hear that I failed
to be a decent human being?

1242
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:25,890
Will that keep you from
going out that door?

1243
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:32,340
- No, you being a man, Pop.

1244
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:35,090
You be a real man and have
the guts to ask yourself

1245
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:38,010
why who I am fucking terrifies you.

1246
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:46,360
Then tell me not to go off with Frank.

1247
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:50,700
Or be with Billy, which was
all I ever wanted to do.

1248
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,370
You want me to stay?

1249
01:11:56,290 --> 01:11:58,970
Then all you have to say is
that you had 25 fucking years

1250
01:11:58,970 --> 01:12:00,230
to be my old man,

1251
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:02,350
but you spent it turning your back on me

1252
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:04,970
and tearing me down whenever you could.

1253
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:06,500
That something in you got so scared

1254
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:10,680
you couldn't even stand
the sight of your own kid.

1255
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,430
- You watch yourself.

1256
01:12:14,150 --> 01:12:17,570
You watch how you throw your hate around.

1257
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:20,220
Because take it from me,

1258
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:23,810
sometimes you break things
and you can never fix them.

1259
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:25,300
And you find out later you need them

1260
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:27,550
more than you ever thought.

1261
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:35,670
I failed at being a better
father than my dad, Cambo.

1262
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:38,350
Believe me, I know that.

1263
01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:42,010
I also know it's a lot
tougher than dancing.

1264
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:50,390
- No, you got the tough stuff down, Pop.

1265
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:53,250
Dancing is what's hard for you.

1266
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:55,540
- He is going to hurt you, Cam.

1267
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:57,960
And a lot worse than I could.

1268
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:02,220
- You think so?

1269
01:13:29,630 --> 01:13:32,720
- Where'd that gun come from?

1270
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:36,130
- Been here since he and
Grandpa built the place.

1271
01:13:36,130 --> 01:13:38,050
- Well, your selective
memory almost got me killed.

1272
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:38,920
Now, what else does he got in there

1273
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:41,840
and how do we get it away from him?

1274
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:45,400
- They're driving back to the city, Frank.

1275
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,260
That's what's going to happen now.

1276
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:50,260
They live their lives, we live ours.

1277
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:52,040
- No.

1278
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:55,760
Me and Red, we wait here with them.

1279
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,270
And we wait for you to
come back with the money.

1280
01:13:58,270 --> 01:13:59,110
- No.

1281
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:08,410
It's not going to happen like that, Frank.

1282
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:14,340
- Who says?

1283
01:14:16,070 --> 01:14:16,900
- Me.

1284
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:21,920
- Who?

1285
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:28,470
- Me.

1286
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:35,460
I say.

1287
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:39,850
We go back up the trail,

1288
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:42,720
just like we said.

1289
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:46,400
Come back and hide out here,

1290
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:48,760
just like we said.

1291
01:14:51,930 --> 01:14:53,120
All they're going to do is go back home

1292
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,990
and pray we don't get caught.

1293
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,220
- You know that, huh?

1294
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:58,720
- I know them better than you.

1295
01:15:00,170 --> 01:15:01,760
We stick to the shore.

1296
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:02,820
The path to the mill heads up the mountain

1297
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:05,420
about a quarter mile from here.

1298
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:06,830
- All right, stop!

1299
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:10,380
Put your hands up, both of you!

1300
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:11,580
- What are you doing, Dad?

1301
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:13,020
- Put your hands up, asshole.

1302
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:16,900
You know I'm just looking for a reason.

1303
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:19,900
DJ, go get that gun out of his belt.

1304
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,750
- Go back to the cabin
and drive out of here!

1305
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:25,690
- Stay away from him, Cam.

1306
01:15:25,690 --> 01:15:28,190
- Drive out of here!

1307
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:30,300
- Boo!

1308
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:34,230
Got you, Counselor.

1309
01:15:39,090 --> 01:15:42,930
Well, lookie-loo here
at old Daddy Del, Cameo.

1310
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:46,270
I can really see that Christmas night now.

1311
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:49,340
- That's an old story, asshole.

1312
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:52,150
- You ever met Billy
before that night, Del?

1313
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:53,710
He and Cameo had been more than buddies

1314
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:55,450
for a couple of years.

1315
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:58,400
How the hell did you miss that?

1316
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,240
Don't they believe in knocking

1317
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:01,570
where you come from, Daddy Del?

1318
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:02,430
Because if you would have knocked,

1319
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:04,410
you might not have seen
this horrible thing

1320
01:16:04,410 --> 01:16:08,190
that made you go just a little bit mad.

1321
01:16:08,190 --> 01:16:09,870
He and handsome Billy locked into a little

1322
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:12,160
manhood dance of their own.

1323
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:13,340
Holding each other so close

1324
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:15,670
you couldn't tell where one
began and the other left off.

1325
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:18,980
- Dad!

1326
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,370
- You want me to kill you?

1327
01:16:24,270 --> 01:16:26,250
- Help me out here, Daddy Del.

1328
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:28,790
Was it something like this?

1329
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:31,350
'Cause if it was, you've danced
a million times like this

1330
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:33,220
in your life.

1331
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:35,520
Sometimes even with your own wife.

1332
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,640
- I'll give you two seconds to shut up

1333
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:38,840
and get away from him.

1334
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:41,190
- You're a reasonable man, Del.

1335
01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:42,800
Not with such a narrow view of the world

1336
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,680
that he can't concede
that sometimes love exists

1337
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:47,070
outside the boundaries of gender.

1338
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:47,980
So what exactly,

1339
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:50,350
when you saw your own son
doing a Christmas two-step

1340
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:53,090
with his best buddy,
moved you to such a rage?

1341
01:16:53,090 --> 01:16:55,310
- Just shut up, okay?

1342
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:57,060
You think I'm stupid?

1343
01:16:59,210 --> 01:17:01,620
Red wrote the letters, Frank.

1344
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:05,370
- He tried to tell you that?

1345
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:07,550
- He didn't have to.

1346
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:10,420
- Frank wrote the first one.

1347
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:12,470
He was writing three or
four guys at the same time.

1348
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:15,030
That's what people do
inside to get money sent in.

1349
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:16,000
It's a scam, isn't it, Frank?

1350
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,920
They play like they're lonely
and queer and ask for cash.

1351
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:24,950
That's the only reason
he answered your letters

1352
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:27,000
about Billy in the first place, Cam.

1353
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,670
One day, he hands me a letter
with your picture in it.

1354
01:17:30,670 --> 01:17:32,190
You remember that one?

1355
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:35,040
That's the first time
you mentioned the cabin.

1356
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,080
That had to be the worst fucking
coincidence of your life,

1357
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,790
Cam, and you didn't even know it.

1358
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:40,940
Because once he knew where the cabin was

1359
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:43,690
and how close it was to the mill,

1360
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:48,100
you became the love of his life.

1361
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:50,320
Only he couldn't write it in a way

1362
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,590
that would pull it off, could you?

1363
01:17:52,590 --> 01:17:54,830
- You know how much money
was up there at that mill?

1364
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:56,430
You know he'd say anything to
get you out of the picture.

1365
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:58,100
- I know what a shitty thing it was,

1366
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:00,260
but after a while, except
for signing his name,

1367
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:02,010
everything I said in those
letters is true, Cam.

1368
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:03,990
It's all true.

1369
01:18:03,990 --> 01:18:06,160
Why do you think I'm here?

1370
01:18:07,190 --> 01:18:08,060
- If you believe that--

1371
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:08,890
- He'll bury you.

1372
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:09,790
- You'll believe anything.

1373
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:11,010
- You and everyone here.

1374
01:18:11,010 --> 01:18:11,840
- Bullshit!

1375
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:12,670
- This is over, Frank.

1376
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:13,510
It's done.

1377
01:18:14,410 --> 01:18:16,080
We'll get your money.

1378
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,570
Let them go.

1379
01:18:17,570 --> 01:18:20,150
Cam, he's suffered enough, man.

1380
01:18:21,650 --> 01:18:22,690
- You think this is over?

1381
01:18:22,690 --> 01:18:23,980
- Are you going to make me do this?

1382
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:26,150
- Hey, I'm coming to you, baby boy.

1383
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:27,160
- I will waste you.

1384
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:28,170
- I hear you talking.

1385
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:29,010
- I'll do it.

1386
01:18:29,010 --> 01:18:29,840
- Goddamn it!

1387
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:30,670
Knock it off!

1388
01:18:30,670 --> 01:18:31,500
- I swear.

1389
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:36,850
- Thank you, Counselor.

1390
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:38,630
- You're out of luck, shithead.

1391
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:41,120
- That gun is empty now, moron.

1392
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:46,830
Oh, fuck, let's just take
the gloves off this thing.

1393
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:49,540
- No!

1394
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,060
Get off him, Frank!

1395
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:28,070
Dad?

1396
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:31,550
Dad?

1397
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:36,270
You fucker!

1398
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:48,790
You even take a step toward him

1399
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:50,990
and I'll do it right here, so help me God.

1400
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:53,580
- I get caught, you get caught.

1401
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:55,650
- No shit.

1402
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:59,180
- You won't like it.

1403
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:02,080
Boy like you gets thrown
into a place like that?

1404
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,660
You don't come out whole.

1405
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:06,410
- Get up on the dock.

1406
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:08,790
Do it.

1407
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:14,110
- You think you can just fire that thing?

1408
01:20:14,110 --> 01:20:15,580
- Get up there!

1409
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:17,850
- You don't think you got
to know what you're doing?

1410
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:22,850
- You mean just point it at the
nearest asshole and squeeze?

1411
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:26,050
All the way down.

1412
01:20:31,570 --> 01:20:33,810
Now get in the boat, Frank.

1413
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:36,380
You don't and I'm going
to have to shoot you.

1414
01:20:36,380 --> 01:20:38,330
- Just what are you thinking?

1415
01:20:38,330 --> 01:20:40,920
- Just get in the fucking boat!

1416
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:44,580
Don't make me ask you again.

1417
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:46,250
- Help's on the way.

1418
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,480
What are you doing, Cam?

1419
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,800
Just shoot him!

1420
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,040
- Just what the hell are you
thinking we're going to do now?

1421
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,040
- I think you're going to grab these oars

1422
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:00,940
and row us out of here.

1423
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:01,850
- Cam!

1424
01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:04,710
- We got maybe 10 minutes tops

1425
01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:06,800
before that road starts
filling with police lights.

1426
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,130
You do get that?

1427
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:10,980
- Just blow that piece of shit away

1428
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:13,850
and nobody has to go to prison.

1429
01:21:13,850 --> 01:21:16,470
He dies and nobody has to know the truth

1430
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:18,720
about you or anything else.

1431
01:21:19,690 --> 01:21:23,190
It doesn't have to be like this, baby bro.

1432
01:21:24,350 --> 01:21:26,920
He's going to kill you, Cam!

1433
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:28,820
What the hell are you doing?

1434
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:43,270
- You aren't killing me
or anyone else, Cameo.

1435
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:48,270
Now, what kind of bullshit are
you expecting me to buy here?

1436
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:51,760
Tell me you aren't
pathetic enough to make us

1437
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:55,590
sit out here and wait
for us to get picked up.

1438
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:02,240
You are one sorry little
faggot, aren't you?

1439
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
- I am anything but you.

1440
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:16,750
- Now, you take a real good close look,

1441
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:19,590
you smug little sack of shit.

1442
01:22:19,590 --> 01:22:24,210
You don't think I know what
you see when you look at me?

1443
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:25,050
I'm you.

1444
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:28,440
20 years from now.

1445
01:22:31,490 --> 01:22:34,580
When your heart is as hard as a rock.

1446
01:22:35,930 --> 01:22:37,980
And you're still waiting and praying

1447
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:42,220
for that old man or anyone
else to even look your way.

1448
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:43,800
Waiting and praying

1449
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:47,890
until you don't give a shit

1450
01:22:47,890 --> 01:22:49,970
about anyone or anything.

1451
01:22:55,430 --> 01:22:58,370
You think you can save yourself from that?

1452
01:22:58,370 --> 01:23:00,670
Because I'm telling you,

1453
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:02,920
sure as we're sitting here,

1454
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:09,650
that your sweet old daddy's
great distaste for you

1455
01:23:09,650 --> 01:23:11,190
as a person

1456
01:23:11,190 --> 01:23:12,190
and as a son

1457
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:17,680
isn't gonna die just because I do.

1458
01:23:27,950 --> 01:23:28,780
- Cam!

1459
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:34,110
Cam?

1460
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:38,360
Cambell!

1461
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:01,230
- Cameo!

1462
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:06,740
Cameo!

1463
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:10,170
No!

1464
01:24:11,050 --> 01:24:13,140
- What the hell?

1465
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:14,930
You didn't shoot him?

1466
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:15,760
- Just the boat.

1467
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:19,890
Shot the shit out of it.

1468
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:21,570
They can come get him.

1469
01:24:21,570 --> 01:24:22,760
Frank can't swim.

1470
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:26,580
Dad?

1471
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:36,290
- Troopers at the mill say they found it.

1472
01:25:36,290 --> 01:25:38,090
Right where he said.

1473
01:25:38,090 --> 01:25:40,920
Close to half a million.

1474
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:45,480
This doesn't bode well
for your brother, Deej.

1475
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:48,230
- What if I told you Cam
wasn't in it for the money?

1476
01:25:48,230 --> 01:25:52,730
- I'd say then what
the hell was he in it for?

1477
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,730
- Cambell, I need you to turn around now

1478
01:25:56,730 --> 01:26:00,230
and put your hands behind your back.

1479
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:22,860
- Be honest.

1480
01:27:22,860 --> 01:27:26,970
You like when they rub on you like that.

1481
01:27:26,970 --> 01:27:27,890
- Hey, man.

1482
01:27:29,070 --> 01:27:30,440
Any trouble this time?

1483
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:31,270
- Yeah, they looked at me funny,

1484
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:33,770
went through my pockets twice.

1485
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:38,650
- Thanks for coming, man.

1486
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:40,890
- I didn't come by myself.

1487
01:27:45,350 --> 01:27:47,290
I know you didn't want Mom or anybody

1488
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:49,110
to come and see you out here.

1489
01:27:49,110 --> 01:27:50,900
I didn't even know he
applied for visiting rights,

1490
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:51,940
but there he was in the parking lot

1491
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:53,880
waiting like the rest of us.

1492
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:56,360
- You're kidding me.

1493
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:57,730
Just get him out of here, Deej.

1494
01:27:57,730 --> 01:27:58,560
Please.

1495
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:01,530
Just tell him I'll be out of
here in another six months.

1496
01:28:01,530 --> 01:28:02,860
- He knows, Cam.

1497
01:28:04,990 --> 01:28:08,490
I think him and Mom are going to split up.

1498
01:28:09,850 --> 01:28:11,600
Go easy on him, okay?
