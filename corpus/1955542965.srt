1
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:11,210
<i>Jakob.</i>

2
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:13,645
<i>Are you there, Jakob?</i>

3
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:16,148
<i>Are you listening?</i>

4
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,217
Jakob.

5
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,620
Jakob.

6
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,400
I'm here.

7
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:36,735
I'm right here.

8
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,871
- Don't.
- Shh, shh.

9
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:40,072
Be silent.

10
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:42,207
And hear me.

11
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,877
This is how it must be.

12
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:54,653
Another woman will come.

13
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:57,222
You will see.

14
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,658
There will be another.

15
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:04,363
You will know her

16
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:07,433
by the love she shows to you.

17
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:14,673
Let the words you speak

18
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:19,411
be the words
that call me back to you.

19
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,414
Promise me.

20
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,916
Promise.

21
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:30,923
Jakob.

22
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,939
<i>I will always be your mother.</i>

23
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,742
No.

24
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,148
Carlotta.

25
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,356
- Carlotta...
- <i>Arrivederci.</i>

26
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:46,331
<i>I hardly know the woman I see.</i>

27
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,170
<i>Her name is verena.</i>

28
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:53,071
<i>She is alone.</i>

29
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:03,782
<i>She remembers all of them.</i>

30
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:06,518
<i>Every parting.</i>

31
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,722
<i>Her life is measured out
in good-byes.</i>

32
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:14,026
<i>Each one harder than the last.</i>

33
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:20,465
<i>Enter la rocciosa...</i>

34
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,801
<i>And the boy who wouldn't speak.</i>

35
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,741
My first language.

36
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:13,879
I have these
from previous employers.

37
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,359
Did you live with each family?
Yes.

38
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:30,162
I find it helps
in understanding the child

39
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,763
to know the family.

40
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:34,433
And do you remain in contact
with these people?

41
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:37,703
When a child recovers,
the family

42
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:40,806
will generally choose to forget.

43
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,374
You've no degree.

44
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,209
But they say you've a gift.

45
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:47,813
My skill comes through
experience

46
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:50,482
and a certain, um, sensitivity.

47
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:53,051
Sensitivity.

48
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:56,655
You have no children
of your own.

49
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:59,224
- No.
- Hmm.

50
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:01,193
Your son.

51
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,195
He prefers English?

52
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,731
His mother.

53
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:08,367
My wife wanted him to speak it.

54
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,804
She died. There was an illness.

55
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:15,807
My son has not spoken since.

56
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,410
Seven months...

57
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:20,212
And sixteen days.

58
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,219
Alessio will see you
to your room.

59
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,557
I would like to introduce myself

60
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,226
to your son.

61
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:41,600
You haven't told me his name.

62
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:44,336
I must say there have been
other nurses,

63
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:48,006
all of them as sure
of their talents as you.

64
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,277
My son's name is Jakob.

65
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,631
Hello, Jakob.

66
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:15,267
My name is verena,

67
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:19,404
and I'm going to be staying here
for a while.

68
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:21,406
I promise I'm not like
the others.

69
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:23,642
I'm much worse.

70
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,946
Please look at me, Jakob.

71
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,653
I'd like to help you.
Do you understand?

72
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,289
There's no point.

73
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,492
He won't even nod his head.

74
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:44,129
He won't write or draw...

75
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,666
Sing or laugh...

76
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,301
Smile...

77
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,071
Cry.

78
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,494
<i>Grazie.</i>

79
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,881
We'll begin our work
in the morning, Jakob.

80
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:38,283
Say 9:00?

81
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:40,785
Your questions are wasted.

82
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,888
Jakob doesn't need to answer me.

83
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,891
I think he understands that.

84
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,729
Enough.

85
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,135
Sit down.

86
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,950
Now you may go.

87
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,154
Good night, Jakob.

88
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:24,563
He is very obedient.

89
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:25,764
Hmm.

90
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:28,366
This is part of it.

91
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:32,270
To disobey
is to say something, so...

92
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,539
So he obeys.

93
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,374
He isn't trying to hurt you.

94
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:39,010
That's my son,<i> signorina,</i>
not me.

95
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,779
Hmm.

96
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,849
Jakob doesn't want you here.

97
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:49,020
He hasn't shown it yet,
but he will.

98
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:52,857
There is such power
in his silence.

99
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,359
You will feel it.

100
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,831
You speak very harshly to him.

101
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,005
Braver than the others.

102
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,479
I have some things
I need to ask.

103
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,147
What things?

104
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,821
Tomorrow, perhaps.

105
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,225
<i>To begin with,
I will tell you what I see.</i>

106
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:37,529
I see...

107
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:40,331
That if you wanted to speak,

108
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,900
you could.

109
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:48,039
Hmm, and I see
how hard it must be

110
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,910
to truly say nothing...

111
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:56,881
How hard you must be
concentrating every moment.

112
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:01,553
And I must admit,
you're very good at it.

113
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,827
I know a little something
of what it feels

114
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:12,864
to be apart from the world.

115
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:17,368
I lost my mother when I was
a little bit younger than you...

116
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,138
And my father when I was
a little bit older.

117
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:32,250
It's a lovely day.

118
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,785
I have an idea.

119
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,360
Jakob?

120
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,598
Jakob!

121
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,983
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

122
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,809
Jakob?

123
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,846
Jakob?

124
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,568
Jakob?

125
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,419
Oh. Please forgive me.
I didn't...

126
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:56,321
verena.

127
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:59,457
The nurse, of course.

128
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,062
Come closer.

129
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:05,964
Let Lilia see you.

130
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,070
You've come
to make the boy talk.

131
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:13,805
Just to help if I can.

132
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,974
Oh, welcome.

133
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,342
Welcome.

134
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,277
Welcome to la rocciosa,
my child.

135
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,180
<i>Grazie.</i>

136
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:25,316
You're very kind.

137
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,285
But I should go.

138
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:30,755
Yes, of course. Go find the boy.

139
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,991
Make him talk.

140
00:16:57,217 --> 00:17:00,685
I'm sorry.
I-i was looking for Jakob.

141
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,320
Do you play?

142
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:04,422
No, I, uh, never could.

143
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,695
This is your wife?

144
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,697
Yes.

145
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,866
What was her name?

146
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,838
You spent time with Jakob
this morning.

147
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,873
Yes.

148
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,742
And did you observe anything?

149
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,645
I need to understand
what he has been through.

150
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,183
Malvina.

151
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:33,985
Malvina rivi.

152
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:36,988
You may have heard of her.

153
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,090
No.

154
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:41,926
That's carnegie hall.

155
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:44,862
She played all over the world,
in all the great halls,

156
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,065
for kings and queens,

157
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,900
presidents.

158
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:54,939
She was very beautiful.

159
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:56,941
Six months after
that photograph was taken,

160
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:59,177
she was dead.

161
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:02,213
It began after our return.

162
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:05,583
It started as a simple fever

163
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,185
<i>and became like fire.</i>

164
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:09,520
<i>Each day, it consumed
a little bit more</i>

165
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,189
<i>of her strength,</i>

166
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:13,458
her beauty.

167
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:19,030
<i>I had to leave to find help,</i>

168
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:23,434
<i>and Jakob stayed with her.</i>

169
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:28,372
He and Lilia
nursed her together.

170
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:31,509
He wouldn't leave
his mother's side.

171
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:41,919
He has his mother's gift.

172
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:46,724
They would sit here
and play together for hours.

173
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,667
He chooses not to speak?

174
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,970
Oh, this... this must be

175
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,672
that incredible sensitivity
of yours?

176
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:04,142
I mean, there is no injury?

177
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,477
No incapacity?

178
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:10,248
Something inside him
has been broken.

179
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,584
It is simply a refusal...

180
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:15,920
A denial...

181
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:19,624
As if, by this vigil...

182
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:23,461
He can undo what is done.

183
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:27,632
You're telling me
he wants his mother back, hmm?

184
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:31,035
Well, that's a...
That's a revelation.

185
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:56,093
I've... I've been
looking for you, Jakob.

186
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,896
I'm here to work,

187
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:01,632
not to play hide-and-seek.

188
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,407
No.

189
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:17,215
I haven't finished yet, Jakob.

190
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:37,101
You have a very beautiful home.

191
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:38,436
Thank you.

192
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:43,774
I do hope
you'll be comfortable here.

193
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,048
Once, Jakob,

194
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,651
I stayed with a family in lucca.

195
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:57,521
Their house hadn't been cleaned

196
00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:00,258
in years.

197
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,862
There were cockroaches
as big as your father's watch.

198
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:09,066
And once, I stayed with a family
in piacenza.

199
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:12,570
I shared a room with the cook

200
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:16,707
who snored<i> come un bufalo.</i>

201
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:23,080
So, yes, I'm sure...

202
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:25,650
I will be very comfortable here.

203
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:28,219
In truth, I cannot think
of this place as my own.

204
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:32,790
My wife's family has lived here
for 1,200 years.

205
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,125
Mm.

206
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,494
I'm just a visitor.

207
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:39,630
Alessio's family has been here
for just as long.

208
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:43,501
The women work here
in the house.

209
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:46,437
The men, in the quarry.

210
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:48,172
The quarry?

211
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:50,141
It's where all this comes from,

212
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,842
the wealth of the family.

213
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:55,079
The stone was once
highly prized.

214
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:56,847
Was?

215
00:21:56,849 --> 00:22:00,318
She allowed it to flood
at the beginning of the war.

216
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,254
Times were difficult.

217
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:05,489
And she had her career.

218
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:09,460
No more need for the stone.

219
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:13,364
Jakob swims there.

220
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:16,300
He'll take you there
if you wish.

221
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:17,601
Yes.

222
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:20,171
I'd like that very much.

223
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,373
<i>Salve.</i>

224
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,894
Let me.

225
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:25,696
<i>Per favore.</i>

226
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,876
It's been so long.

227
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,114
I...

228
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:45,983
Used to do this to her

229
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:49,587
every night of her life...

230
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:52,690
Since she was a tiny girl.

231
00:24:56,495 --> 00:25:00,030
She began to perform

232
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:02,233
when she was fourteen.

233
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,104
She took me with her everywhere.

234
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,345
Nobody knew her as I did...

235
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,550
Knew her moods,

236
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:22,520
her needs.

237
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:25,322
Oh...

238
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:27,525
How I loved her.

239
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,233
Jakob, was it you?

240
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:11,769
If it was, then all you've done
is tell me you're afraid.

241
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:15,606
Ja...

242
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:19,243
Jakob.

243
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,178
Jakob, what is it?

244
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,397
Jakob.

245
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:42,733
- Aah!
- What?

246
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:43,767
Jakob, no!

247
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,369
Wait! Wait!

248
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:56,614
Jakob?

249
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:58,482
Hey!

250
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:01,885
Jakob.

251
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:02,920
Jakob, no.

252
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:04,488
Quiet. Quiet.

253
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,490
Be quiet. Be quiet.

254
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:10,427
Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

255
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:12,029
Quiet.

256
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,906
Enough.

257
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:24,308
Stop!

258
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,443
<i>I should have left him.</i>

259
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:28,512
He was by the wall
as if he was...

260
00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:30,614
Listening.

261
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:32,850
Yes, I've seen him do it.

262
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:34,518
In his bedroom.

263
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,855
Also in the garden.

264
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:40,357
In the quarry.

265
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,359
I assume it's his mother
he hears

266
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:44,662
or thinks he hears.

267
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:46,630
It seems to give him comfort.

268
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:48,599
I should have been told.

269
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:55,606
It changes the situation.

270
00:27:55,608 --> 00:27:59,143
It may indicate
a far more serious condition.

271
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:01,145
You don't believe
in such voices?

272
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:03,180
No.

273
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,848
No,<i> signore,</i> I do not.

274
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,116
Nor do I.

275
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:08,852
Sometimes I wish I did.

276
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:12,690
Have you considered

277
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:14,658
taking him away from this place?

278
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,126
Yes, of course.

279
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:18,062
It was impossible.

280
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:19,563
It was as you saw last night.

281
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:22,132
He became a danger to himself
and to others.

282
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:23,667
Then he should be in hospital.

283
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:25,235
No, absolutely not.

284
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:27,071
No.

285
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:29,306
<i>Signore,</i> I'm no longer sure
I can care for your son.

286
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:30,708
Why?

287
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:33,811
I have been misled
about what is required.

288
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:36,380
I must consider whether I am
properly qualified.

289
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:38,348
You're just like the others.

290
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,487
I await your decision.

291
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,784
Jakob.

292
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:17,588
Jakob! Jakob!

293
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,431
Help me down.

294
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:49,513
You scared me, Jakob.

295
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:52,249
But you've helped me
realize something.

296
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,589
I can't leave you.

297
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,130
I once knew a boy

298
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:09,499
who thought he could hear
his dead sister

299
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:13,503
through the teeth
of an old comb.

300
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:15,873
He would sit with it for hours,

301
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:19,009
listening and whispering
his secrets.

302
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:22,713
He was as sure of what he heard
as you are.

303
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:28,886
The mind is capable
of extraordinary things.

304
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,856
It is your mind that is
speaking to you, Jakob,

305
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:34,491
nothing else.

306
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,999
I'm not saying that...

307
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:44,034
That what you hear isn't real,

308
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:47,404
because anything we experience
is real in its own way,

309
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,106
but it's...

310
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:52,910
It's not what it pretends to be.

311
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:55,746
It's important
to understand that.

312
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:02,886
I want to hear you speak.

313
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:05,222
But I am not your enemy.

314
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:07,324
I care about you.

315
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:10,761
What is it?

316
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:15,132
You wish to leave?

317
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,969
Jakob?

318
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,667
Lucia...

319
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:25,602
Ugolina...

320
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:31,008
Angelica...

321
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,212
<i>La signora</i> malvina.

322
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,818
Jakob?

323
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,121
Come with me, please.

324
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:05,368
<i>I think you're afraid
that if you speak,</i>

325
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,504
the voice will cease.

326
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,976
Come.

327
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:15,445
We'll listen together.

328
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:20,383
I'll tell you what I hear.

329
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,193
It's strange...

330
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:05,996
The sounds.

331
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:09,232
One could imagine
almost anything.

332
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:15,772
But she's not there.

333
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:18,341
I want you to stop this.

334
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:22,612
The dead do not speak.

335
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:26,516
I know it, Jakob.

336
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:29,352
I know it well.

337
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:32,556
However hard we wish them to,

338
00:36:32,558 --> 00:36:36,693
the dead remain silent.

339
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:00,817
Good night, Jakob.

340
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:55,732
Your father told me
you have her gift.

341
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:02,339
What would she say if she knew
you might never use it again?

342
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:09,546
She must have spoken
about the future

343
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:11,948
before she died...

344
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:15,352
About the wonderful things
that lie ahead for you.

345
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:20,757
Try to remember what she said.

346
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:26,363
And imagine what she might say
now if she could see you.

347
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,909
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

348
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,744
<i>Signore.</i>

349
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,980
There's a story about that cat.

350
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:22,619
It was the custom amongst those
building houses such as this

351
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:25,855
to... to seal a cat
within the walls

352
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:28,124
as a protection against evil.

353
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:29,459
A dead cat?

354
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:30,760
No.

355
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,195
Not dead.

356
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,465
That's horrible.

357
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:37,267
Of course.

358
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:39,969
I-I'm a fool
to speak lightly of it.

359
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:41,971
Forgive me.

360
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:44,541
- Jakob will be waiting.
- Yes.

361
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:10,667
<i>Now, if you were to play,</i>

362
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:14,304
<i>it would mean only
what you wanted it to mean.</i>

363
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:16,673
Play for me, Jakob.

364
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:30,487
Perhaps I was wrong earlier
when I spoke about your mother.

365
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,329
Perhaps your silence

366
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:44,100
wouldn't horrify her
as it does me.

367
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,538
It is said that a true performer

368
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,708
cares only for the love
of her audience.

369
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:58,515
Perhaps...

370
00:41:58,517 --> 00:42:01,050
Your silence
is a fitting tribute.

371
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:08,725
More adoration
as she leaves the stage.

372
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:13,730
What are you telling me, Jakob...

373
00:42:13,732 --> 00:42:15,365
That I'm wrong
or that I'm right?

374
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:18,234
You can t...

375
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:24,374
I do it to help you, Jakob.

376
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:33,816
<i>The boy was upset today.</i>

377
00:42:33,818 --> 00:42:35,952
He's sick.

378
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:40,924
He needs help.

379
00:42:40,926 --> 00:42:43,393
And he's breaking
his father's heart.

380
00:42:46,331 --> 00:42:48,064
The boy...

381
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:50,833
Is all that matters.

382
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:54,103
He is the future.

383
00:42:54,105 --> 00:42:56,105
Look at yourself...

384
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:58,174
How beautiful you are.

385
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,983
Give me your hands.

386
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,425
Oh.

387
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:18,528
They're strong,

388
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:20,930
like hers.

389
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,603
He will not speak to please you.

390
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:34,243
The boy will speak
when the time is right.

391
00:43:34,245 --> 00:43:36,446
He's waiting.

392
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:42,652
But he's waited long enough.

393
00:43:42,654 --> 00:43:44,821
Surely that is clear to anyone.

394
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:51,828
When he speaks...

395
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:54,330
Where will you go?

396
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:56,833
To the next place.

397
00:43:56,835 --> 00:43:59,168
Oh.

398
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,471
Lonely child.

399
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,988
<i>There's a story about that
cat within the walls.</i>

400
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:53,723
<i>He's waiting.</i>

401
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,062
Oh.

402
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:36,265
I wondered if Jakob
was still here.

403
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:38,334
No.

404
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,006
May I see?

405
00:45:44,008 --> 00:45:45,942
If you wish.

406
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:54,951
It's my wife.

407
00:45:54,953 --> 00:45:56,853
She was the worst
possible model...

408
00:45:56,855 --> 00:45:58,588
Restless, complaining.

409
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:01,891
She was the worst

410
00:46:01,893 --> 00:46:04,160
and also the best.

411
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,964
And this one?

412
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:16,305
I have not worked
in many months.

413
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:19,041
It was to be of her.

414
00:46:19,043 --> 00:46:22,378
You cannot finish it,
so you abandoned it.

415
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,250
Perhaps to see you work,

416
00:46:27,252 --> 00:46:30,920
it would help Jakob.

417
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:34,056
Perhaps it would signify hope.

418
00:46:34,058 --> 00:46:35,792
Yes.

419
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:39,629
Perhaps.

420
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:28,297
Hello?

421
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,969
Lilia?

422
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:18,214
I keep it clean for her.

423
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:26,389
She was here at the end.

424
00:50:26,391 --> 00:50:29,225
We nursed her day and night...

425
00:50:29,227 --> 00:50:30,760
Me and the boy.

426
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:35,231
He saw terrible things.

427
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:39,568
He heard...

428
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:43,239
Terrible things.

429
00:50:44,842 --> 00:50:49,645
When she died, I washed her...

430
00:50:49,647 --> 00:50:52,248
A-and tidied her hair.

431
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,257
The room upsets you.

432
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:06,929
Oh, you've torn your dress.

433
00:51:06,931 --> 00:51:08,531
Uh, yes.

434
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:11,967
Yes, I-i wondered
if I might borrow some thread.

435
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:16,672
I have an idea.

436
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:24,113
Oh, no.

437
00:51:24,115 --> 00:51:26,382
No, no, I-i couldn't.

438
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:27,850
Wait.

439
00:51:27,852 --> 00:51:30,953
I ca... i really...
Please, I really can't.

440
00:51:30,955 --> 00:51:32,621
Let's see. This?

441
00:51:32,623 --> 00:51:34,290
No.

442
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:41,764
Try this on.

443
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:45,301
See how it fits, huh?

444
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:16,832
<i>Brava. Bellisima.</i>

445
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:19,568
Ah,<i> perfetto.</i>

446
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:23,105
<i>Bellisima.</i>

447
00:52:23,107 --> 00:52:26,408
I-I-i tore my dre... my skirt.

448
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:27,843
Take it off.

449
00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:28,978
Yes.

450
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,001
No.

451
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:55,938
No.

452
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,778
Put it on.

453
00:53:26,304 --> 00:53:29,038
Put that one away.

454
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:24,153
<i>Signore.</i>

455
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:28,023
Please.

456
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:38,267
I have something to ask.

457
00:55:38,269 --> 00:55:42,538
You may very likely refuse.

458
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:46,742
What is it?

459
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:50,846
I saw this afternoon

460
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:53,449
something I had previously
failed to notice,

461
00:55:53,451 --> 00:55:57,486
certain resemblances
between you...

462
00:55:57,488 --> 00:55:59,321
You and my wife.

463
00:55:59,323 --> 00:56:01,190
I...

464
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:08,564
I-I think you know
what it is I ask.

465
00:56:18,842 --> 00:56:20,576
If I have offended you,
I apologize

466
00:56:20,578 --> 00:56:23,979
and ask that we forget
the matter entirely.

467
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:32,988
Your work here
will be unaffected.

468
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:31,613
Look at yourself,

469
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:34,049
how beautiful you are.

470
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:52,060
Your left leg forward.

471
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:57,833
Your hand.

472
00:58:57,835 --> 00:59:00,669
Yes, your hand.

473
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:03,071
Your head.

474
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:07,142
This way, yes.

475
00:59:07,144 --> 00:59:09,144
Just a little more.

476
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:14,049
Don't move.

477
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:05,861
<i>Bring them in.</i>

478
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:21,510
<i>Bring them in.</i>

479
01:02:45,062 --> 01:02:47,195
<i>Jakob.</i>

480
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:00,609
<i>Jakob.</i>

481
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:05,781
<i>I'm here.</i>

482
01:03:05,783 --> 01:03:08,383
<i>I'm right here.</i>

483
01:03:08,385 --> 01:03:10,385
<i>Jakob.</i>

484
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:43,084
I'm going to look after you.

485
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:47,022
I promise.

486
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:24,659
You're hurting him now.

487
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:28,463
Let me care for him.

488
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:32,267
Let me care for them both.

489
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:17,339
Is it her?

490
01:06:17,341 --> 01:06:19,374
Or is it me?

491
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:52,901
You wanted to see me?

492
01:07:57,673 --> 01:08:00,175
I think it's time for us

493
01:08:00,177 --> 01:08:02,777
to review the progress
of your work,

494
01:08:02,779 --> 01:08:06,381
to discuss any changes
in Jakob's behavior.

495
01:08:06,383 --> 01:08:08,483
He needs me.

496
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:11,786
I can help him.

497
01:08:11,788 --> 01:08:14,856
And yet he has still
said nothing.

498
01:08:14,858 --> 01:08:16,424
It's for me to protect him,

499
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:19,694
and now I have made
things worse.

500
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:30,371
She wants me here...

501
01:08:30,373 --> 01:08:35,276
To take care of Jakob and...

502
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:38,113
And to take care of you.

503
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:44,953
The voice is real.

504
01:09:00,936 --> 01:09:02,971
You're mad.

505
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:05,974
Yes.

506
01:09:05,976 --> 01:09:07,475
You said it yourself...

507
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:09,277
Serious condition.

508
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:11,146
I should have paid
closer attention.

509
01:09:11,148 --> 01:09:14,282
Instead of helping Jakob,
you've made yourself unwell.

510
01:09:14,284 --> 01:09:16,017
Now you hear whatever you wish.

511
01:09:16,019 --> 01:09:17,585
- No.
- Yes.

512
01:09:17,587 --> 01:09:19,754
Why would she speak to you
and not to her husband?

513
01:09:19,756 --> 01:09:23,091
Please don't send me away.
Please.

514
01:09:23,093 --> 01:09:26,027
I must do what is best,

515
01:09:26,029 --> 01:09:29,998
above all, for Jakob.

516
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:42,277
Jakob!

517
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:44,012
Jakob.

518
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:57,025
He's going to send me away.

519
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:02,564
Tell me what I must do.

520
01:10:02,566 --> 01:10:04,199
Tell me.

521
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:07,402
Tell me.

522
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:15,810
Tell me.

523
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:20,415
Tell me. Tell me.

524
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:24,419
Tell me.

525
01:10:25,921 --> 01:10:28,056
Tell me.

526
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:33,995
Tell me.

527
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:40,668
Tell me! Tell me!

528
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:44,872
Tell me. Tell me.

529
01:10:44,874 --> 01:10:46,441
Tell me!

530
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,463
<i>Jakob.</i>

531
01:11:09,865 --> 01:11:11,866
<i>Jakob.</i>

532
01:11:14,136 --> 01:11:17,805
<i>Another woman will come.</i>

533
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:21,476
<i>This is how it must be.</i>

534
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:29,484
We must help her.

535
01:11:47,169 --> 01:11:48,469
Jakob.

536
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:51,973
Jakob, listen to me closely.

537
01:11:51,975 --> 01:11:56,644
Your mother
is watching over you.

538
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:58,746
But she is suffering.

539
01:11:58,748 --> 01:12:00,682
She is tired.

540
01:12:00,684 --> 01:12:02,417
And she is trapped.

541
01:12:02,419 --> 01:12:04,252
Jakob,

542
01:12:04,254 --> 01:12:06,087
we must help her.

543
01:12:06,089 --> 01:12:07,522
We must help her.

544
01:12:07,524 --> 01:12:10,191
You know what you must do.

545
01:12:10,193 --> 01:12:11,492
Jakob.

546
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:13,728
Jakob. Jakob!

547
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:26,941
Jakob, stop!

548
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,122
Jakob!

549
01:12:41,124 --> 01:12:43,191
Jakob!

550
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:49,263
Stop, Jakob!

551
01:12:54,837 --> 01:12:56,304
Jakob, no.

552
01:12:56,306 --> 01:12:57,705
No, no, no.

553
01:12:57,707 --> 01:12:59,841
It's time.

554
01:12:59,843 --> 01:13:02,677
It's time.

555
01:13:02,679 --> 01:13:04,979
You have to let her go.

556
01:13:04,981 --> 01:13:06,748
No. Jakob.

557
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:09,150
No, it has to be now.

558
01:13:09,152 --> 01:13:12,353
Do you understand?

559
01:13:12,355 --> 01:13:16,924
He will send me away
if you don't speak.

560
01:13:16,926 --> 01:13:18,993
Speak.

561
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:21,896
Speak.

562
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:23,931
Speak! Speak!

563
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:25,600
Speak!

564
01:13:40,216 --> 01:13:42,250
No.

565
01:14:40,576 --> 01:14:41,776
Jakob.

566
01:14:41,778 --> 01:14:43,811
<i>This is how it must be.</i>

567
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:26,020
What are you doing?

568
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:28,122
- I must leave.
- No.

569
01:15:28,124 --> 01:15:30,858
Sir, she's given me her illness.

570
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,628
You have a fever. That is all.

571
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:35,229
You don't have to leave.

572
01:15:35,231 --> 01:15:36,964
I want you to stay.

573
01:15:36,966 --> 01:15:39,867
Forgive me. We've been
under her spell too long...

574
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:43,137
Not only Jakob, all of us.

575
01:15:44,806 --> 01:15:46,307
I can't.

576
01:15:46,309 --> 01:15:48,843
No, Jakob needs you.

577
01:15:48,845 --> 01:15:50,945
Please.

578
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:56,884
I'm so afraid.

579
01:15:56,886 --> 01:16:00,354
Lilia... where is she?

580
01:16:00,356 --> 01:16:01,656
Who?

581
01:16:01,658 --> 01:16:02,857
Lilia.

582
01:16:02,859 --> 01:16:05,393
What do you mean?

583
01:16:05,395 --> 01:16:07,828
Where is she?

584
01:16:08,997 --> 01:16:10,831
She's dead.

585
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:13,234
On the day of malvina's funeral,

586
01:16:13,236 --> 01:16:16,771
she put stones in her pockets
and walked into the lake.

587
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:31,419
Verena.

588
01:16:34,424 --> 01:16:35,623
Verena!

589
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:48,362
<i>Look at yourself.</i>

590
01:18:19,128 --> 01:18:22,363
Not here.

591
01:18:22,365 --> 01:18:24,532
Not this room.

592
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:27,868
No. No, no, no.

593
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:31,172
No, no, no.

594
01:18:31,174 --> 01:18:34,341
Not this room.

595
01:18:36,179 --> 01:18:38,245
It's all right.

596
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:43,651
<i>Tutto.</i>

597
01:18:43,653 --> 01:18:45,386
<i>Tutto, tutto.</i>

598
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:51,592
The door was locked.

599
01:18:51,594 --> 01:18:52,927
It's for your safety.

600
01:18:52,929 --> 01:18:55,096
Please, Klaus, not this room.

601
01:18:55,098 --> 01:18:58,999
Alessio think it's best
to confuse, confuse.

602
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:00,501
Please don't leave me here.

603
01:19:00,503 --> 01:19:01,936
I'm going to fetch a doctor,

604
01:19:01,938 --> 01:19:03,571
and he'll be here
as soon as he can.

605
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:05,673
Don't leave me here.

606
01:19:05,675 --> 01:19:07,875
Not this room.

607
01:19:07,877 --> 01:19:11,245
I must speak to Jakob.

608
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:14,582
I must speak to Jakob.

609
01:19:21,723 --> 01:19:22,923
Jakob.

610
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:29,363
<i>The boy will speak</i>

611
01:19:29,365 --> 01:19:32,700
<i>when the time is right.</i>

612
01:19:32,702 --> 01:19:35,369
Help me.

613
01:19:46,915 --> 01:19:49,617
Help.

614
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:05,900
Help me.

615
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:28,422
Oh, god, please.

616
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:48,502
Good morning.

617
01:21:49,771 --> 01:21:51,805
You're feeling better?

618
01:21:58,179 --> 01:22:01,682
Everything's going to be fine.
I promise.

619
01:22:01,684 --> 01:22:03,751
I was worried.

620
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:07,288
Where is Jakob?

621
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:10,818
I miss my mama.

622
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:15,589
I'm here.

623
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:18,425
I'm right here.

624
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:26,834
Jakob.

625
01:23:49,524 --> 01:23:52,226
<i>I try to think of a time
before this.</i>

626
01:23:53,895 --> 01:23:56,230
<i>I hardly know the woman I see.</i>

627
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:59,233
<i>But the past is a dream</i>

628
01:23:59,235 --> 01:24:02,036
<i>from which we wake
with each new morning.</i>

629
01:24:08,677 --> 01:24:12,246
<i>We are, none of us,
quite who we were.</i>

630
01:24:36,872 --> 01:24:38,906
Come, Jakob.

631
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:42,609
Sit with me.
