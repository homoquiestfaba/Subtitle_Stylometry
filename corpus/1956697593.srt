the center of civilization

disappear

honor their contracts.

I then discover that
the man I came to find

1232

has in fact been robbed,
cut up, and maybe even eaten,

1233

to be quiet about it?

and perhaps it is true--

1240
01:09:48,706 --> 01:09:51,796

human flesh is addictive,

1241
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:54,146

no other meat gives

1242

the same gustatory
satisfaction.

have you, at last?

01:24:57,657 --> 01:25:00,182
I was afraid I'd lost you
there, sir, I was indeed,

1435

which would have been
a great sadness to me, sir--

a sadness and a loss,
not least to surgical science,

for I propose to use you,
Mr. Carlyle,

Has it ever occurred
to you, Mr. Carlyle,

1448

that the most
inventive talents
of any civilization

1449

were not devoted
to buildings or irrigation
