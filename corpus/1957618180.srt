00:12:26,804 --> 00:12:27,847
IS IN THE CENTER DRAWER,

194
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,475
EXACTLY WHERE I LEFT IT.

195
00:12:30,475 --> 00:12:31,517
NO, I CAN'T JUST

196
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:32,602
DROP EVERYTHING--

197
00:12:32,602 --> 00:12:33,686
I'm sorry, honey,

198
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,729
it's corporate accounts.

199
00:12:34,729 --> 00:12:35,938
YEAH, THAT'S WHY YOU GET PAID

200
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:37,982
THE BIG BUCKS.

201
00:12:37,982 --> 00:12:41,194
UH, LOOK, I REALLY

202
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,362
AM NOT GONNA JUST...

203
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:46,199
JUST LET ME TALK TO DEE.

204
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:48,367
DEE, I CANNOT KEEP BABYSITTING

205
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:52,205
THESE GUYS...

206
00:12:58,461 --> 00:13:02,048
HONEY, I'M REALLY SORRY.

207
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:05,134
YOU'RE GOING OUT?

208
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:11,808
I KNOW I PROMISED YOU,

209
00:13:11,808 --> 00:13:13,559
AND I'M GONNA MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

210
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,644
I DON'T KNOW-- I'LL--

211
00:13:14,644 --> 00:13:15,728
I'LL GET SOME--

212
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:16,771
SOME TICKETS OR SOMETHING.

213
00:13:16,771 --> 00:13:17,855
YOU LIKE BASKETBALL.

214
00:13:17,855 --> 00:13:18,898
NO, IT'S OKAY.

215
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:19,982
I'VE CALLED MARIO'S.

216
00:13:19,982 --> 00:13:21,317
THEY'RE GONNA SEND UP PIZZA.

217
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:22,401
I'M SORRY, HONEY.

218
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:23,444
NO, I'LL JUST WATCH

219
00:13:23,444 --> 00:13:24,529
A LITTLE T.V.

220
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:25,571
OKAY, 'BYE.

221
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:26,656
( woman screaming

222
00:13:26,656 --> 00:13:29,659
on television )

223
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:12,952
( snickers ) LIKE HE'D

224
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,538
REALLY GO IN THERE.

225
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,152
( traffic sounds )

226
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:47,612
WE GOT EGGS, WE GOT BACON,

227
00:14:47,612 --> 00:14:48,654
WE'VE GOT TOAST,

228
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,490
WE'VE GOT GRAPEFRUIT.

229
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,326
( kisses Zach )

230
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:56,496
UH... ZACH, I GOT SOME BAD NEWS.

231
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:57,538
( sighs ) YOU GOTTA GO

232
00:14:57,538 --> 00:14:58,789
BACK TO WORK, RIGHT?

233
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:00,374
YEAH, ONE OF MY CLIENTS

234
00:15:00,374 --> 00:15:01,459
IS MERGING WITH TWO OTHER

235
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:02,501
COMPANIES, AND THE LAWYERS

236
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:03,586
WANT A REVISED FINANCIAL

237
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:05,338
STATEMENT BY MONDAY, AND...

238
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:06,923
HEY, IT'S COOL.

239
00:15:06,923 --> 00:15:08,007
WELL, I-I DIDN'T WANT

240
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,342
TO WAKE YOU. I WANTED TO

241
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:10,426
LET YOU SLEEP AS LATE

242
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:13,012
AS YOU COULD, BUT, UM... IT'S

243
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,597
ALMOST NOON, AND I GOTTA GO.

244
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:17,683
IT'S ALL RIGHT. I UNDERSTAND.

245
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,769
UH... TAKE A CAB.

246
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:22,188
IT'S, UH...

247
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:24,190
HERE WE GO.

248
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,691
LIKE USUAL.

249
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,276
YEAH, JUST A DAY EARLIER,

250
00:15:27,276 --> 00:15:28,527
RIGHT?

251
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:35,535
( sighs )

252
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:36,577
DON'T WORRY.

253
00:15:36,577 --> 00:15:38,537
YOU'RE STILL THE BEST MOM I GOT.

254
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:41,541
( faint chuckle )

255
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:47,630
Okay. Bye-bye.

256
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,550
GOOD MORNING, SIR.

257
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,552
OOPS!

258
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,387
( indistinct chatter )

259
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:55,471
TAKE IT EASY, BOB.

260
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:59,725
NICE DAY.

261
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:00,810
IT'S COOL.

262
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,813
I'M GONNA TAKE THE SUBWAY.

263
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,232
EXCUSE ME.

264
00:18:11,232 --> 00:18:12,358
I-I DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU.

265
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,068
I'M SORRY.

266
00:18:14,068 --> 00:18:15,152
UM, DO YOU KNOW WHERE

267
00:18:15,152 --> 00:18:16,862
THE NUMBER 6 LINE IS?

268
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:19,490
DOES IT STOP DOWN THIS WAY?

269
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,950
NUMBER 6?

270
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,494
OH, THE NUMBER 6!

271
00:18:23,494 --> 00:18:24,537
YEAH, YEAH, I CAN SHOW YOU.

272
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:25,663
I'D BE HAPPY TO. MY PLEASURE.

273
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:30,626
IT'S, UH, IT'S... THIS WAY.

274
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:32,253
COME WITH ME.

275
00:18:32,253 --> 00:18:34,839
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHOW ME.

276
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:37,883
( screaming )

277
00:18:53,858 --> 00:18:55,776
( stammering ) ...WHO...?

278
00:18:55,776 --> 00:18:57,236
VALENTINE CUTTER,

279
00:18:57,236 --> 00:19:01,073
AT YOUR SERVICE, SIR.

280
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:04,076
W-WHAT HAPPENED?

281
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,161
WHEN?

282
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:07,413
THAT GUY?

283
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:09,248
W-WHAT WAS HE DOING?

284
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,291
WHAT DO YOU THINK

285
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,750
HE WAS DOING?

286
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,254
HIS FACE... WAS A...

287
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,257
A SKULL.

288
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,259
I KNOW YOU.

289
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,594
YOU THREW THAT RAT AT ME.

290
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,471
ARE YOU SURE IT WAS A RAT?

291
00:19:23,471 --> 00:19:24,555
IT WAS A RAT.

292
00:19:24,555 --> 00:19:26,474
YOU LOOKED AT IT CAREFULLY?

293
00:19:26,474 --> 00:19:28,267
WELL, NO...

294
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,310
WELL, IT COULD HAVE BEEN

295
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,394
SOMETHING ELSE.

296
00:19:30,394 --> 00:19:31,854
IT LOOKED LIKE A RAT.

297
00:19:31,854 --> 00:19:33,856
PERHAPS IT WAS AN ILLUSION.

298
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:34,940
THINGS ARE NOT ALWAYS

299
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,776
AS THEY SEEM, YOUNG MAN.

300
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,778
I GET IT.

301
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,822
YOU'RE DOING A MOVIE, RIGHT?

302
00:19:41,822 --> 00:19:43,115
IS IT RICK BAKER?

303
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,742
GREAT MAKEUP AND EFFECTS.

304
00:19:44,742 --> 00:19:45,785
DON'T LET HIM GO!

305
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,579
I WON'T TELL! COME ON!

306
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:50,080
IT'S RICK BAKER, ISN'T IT?

307
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,791
OR IS IT CLIVE BARKER?

308
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,292
DWAYNE WANTS TO APOLOGIZE

309
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,169
FOR SCARING YOU,

310
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:57,129
DON'T YOU, DWAYNE?

311
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:00,966
I'M SORRY.

312
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,969
NO, THAT'S OKAY.

313
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,846
UH, I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR

314
00:20:05,846 --> 00:20:07,348
THE NUMBER 6 LINE.

315
00:20:07,348 --> 00:20:10,851
MAY I SUGGEST YOU FOLLOW ME.

316
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,407
GABE AND J.T.

317
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:28,410
AREN'T GONNA BELIEVE THIS!

318
00:20:37,127 --> 00:20:40,339
THAT'S YOUR TRAIN, I BELIEVE.

319
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,632
ARE YOU CATCHING THIS ONE?

320
00:20:41,632 --> 00:20:43,259
NO, MY, UH...

321
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:45,344
MY FRIEND AND I WILL WAIT.

322
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:46,428
OH.

323
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:47,930
BON VOYAGE.

324
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:52,184
WELL... THANKS ANYWAY. UH...

325
00:22:13,641 --> 00:22:16,352
WHAT? H-HOW DID YOU--?

326
00:22:16,352 --> 00:22:17,436
I SAW YOU BACK THERE

327
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,773
ON THE PLATFORM WHEN...

328
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:23,108
IT WAS YOUR STUNT DOUBLE.

329
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:26,070
IS THAT IT?

330
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,447
IS THIS TRAIN HEADING DOWNTOWN?

331
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:31,951
I BELIEVE SO.

332
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:34,286
DOES IT STOP AT CANAL STREET?

333
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,246
NOT ANYMORE.

334
00:22:36,246 --> 00:22:37,581
WHAT DID HE SAY?

335
00:22:37,581 --> 00:22:38,624
HE ASKED IF IT STOPPED

336
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:40,376
AT CANAL STREET.

337
00:22:40,376 --> 00:22:42,878
( laughter )

338
00:22:48,217 --> 00:22:51,845
WHAT? IT GOES TO BROOKLYN?

339
00:22:51,845 --> 00:22:54,682
( laughter )

340
00:23:02,231 --> 00:23:04,817
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

341
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:05,901
TH-THIS IS A MOVIE SHOOT,

342
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:06,986
RIGHT, AND YOU GOTTA

343
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:08,529
WEAR COSTUMES AND STUFF,

344
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:09,613
AND, UH...

345
00:23:09,613 --> 00:23:10,656
O-OR YOU GET TO PICK A DOOR

346
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:12,408
TO A T.V. SHOW, RIGHT?

347
00:23:12,408 --> 00:23:14,076
T.V. SHOW?

348
00:23:14,076 --> 00:23:15,661
I TOLD YOU, MAN,

349
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:17,496
IT'S LIKE ALL JUNK, YOU KNOW?

350
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:18,997
EXCEPT GILLIGAN'S ISLAND.

351
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:21,333
THAT'S A TRIP.

352
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,418
OH, YES.

353
00:23:22,418 --> 00:23:24,795
THE LITTLE BOX WITH PICTURES.

354
00:23:24,795 --> 00:23:25,838
VERY FUNNY.

355
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:27,840
UH... THIS SOUNDS WEIRD,

356
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,008
BUT THIS KIND OF LOOKS LIKE

357
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:31,552
A GHOST TRAIN,

358
00:23:31,552 --> 00:23:34,722
WITH GHOSTS.

359
00:23:34,722 --> 00:23:36,181
( Valentine chuckles )

360
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:37,891
THAT'S VERY CLOSE.

361
00:23:37,891 --> 00:23:41,353
BUT NOT QUITE RIGHT.

362
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:44,023
NOT DEAD PEOPLE.

363
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,107
NOT DEAD AT ALL.

364
00:23:45,107 --> 00:23:46,191
WELL, GOOD.

365
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:47,276
GLAD TO HEAR IT.

366
00:23:47,276 --> 00:23:49,027
UNDEAD.

367
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,571
WHAT?

368
00:23:50,571 --> 00:23:51,655
ZACHARY, HAVE YOU NEVER

369
00:23:51,655 --> 00:23:52,698
HEARD OF NOSFERATU?

370
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:53,782
YEAH, YEAH, HE'S

371
00:23:53,782 --> 00:23:55,409
IN THAT MOVIE--

372
00:23:55,409 --> 00:23:58,370
BLACK AND WHITE, 1920s.

373
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,872
HOW'D YOU KNOW MY NAME?

374
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:00,914
YOU'D BE AMAZED

375
00:24:00,914 --> 00:24:03,208
AT WHAT I KNOW.

376
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:06,211
AND NOSFERATU ISN'T A "HE,"

377
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:10,716
IT'S A "THEM."

378
00:24:10,716 --> 00:24:14,720
VAMPIRES.

379
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,057
REAL VAMPIRES.

380
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:19,141
WELCOME ABOARD

381
00:24:19,141 --> 00:24:20,225
THE UNDEAD EXPRESS.

382
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:23,479
( laughter )

383
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:34,114
AAH!

384
00:24:34,114 --> 00:24:39,077
( vampires clamoring )

385
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:00,432
( savage growl )

386
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:06,980
HE IS MINE!

387
00:25:16,865 --> 00:25:17,950
YOU NEED NOT WORRY,

388
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,992
MY FRIEND.

389
00:25:18,992 --> 00:25:22,079
YOU ARE UNDER MY PROTECTION.

390
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,375
WHY SHOULD THEY LISTEN

391
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:27,459
TO YOU?

392
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:30,629
BECAUSE I AM THE FIRST.

393
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:31,713
WITHOUT ME, THEY WOULD NOT

394
00:25:31,713 --> 00:25:34,383
KNOW THE PLEASURES OF OUR WORLD.

395
00:25:36,927 --> 00:25:38,887
HOW'D YOU GET HERE?

396
00:25:38,887 --> 00:25:40,973
( faint chuckle )

397
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:46,144
HOW DID I GET DOWN HERE?

398
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:49,481
I WAS RICH, ONCE.

399
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:52,651
THESE TUNNELS...

400
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,486
THIS, UH, CAR...

401
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,989
I OWNED IT ALL.

402
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:58,073
THE SUBWAY?

403
00:25:58,073 --> 00:25:59,658
GET OUTTA HERE!

404
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,076
GET OUT OF WHERE?

405
00:26:01,076 --> 00:26:02,160
OH, THE VERNACULAR, YES.

406
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,290
I, UH...

407
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,834
NO, I, UH, BUILT ALL THIS.

408
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:15,716
IT WAS 1905.

409
00:26:15,716 --> 00:26:19,511
I LIVED ON FIFTH AVENUE,

410
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:24,641
IN A LARGE TOWNHOUSE.

411
00:26:24,641 --> 00:26:30,522
♪ ( chamber music plays ) ♪

412
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,107
I HAD BUILT RAILROADS

413
00:26:32,107 --> 00:26:36,695
ALL OVER THE WORLD,

414
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:37,738
SO WHEN THEY PROPOSED

415
00:26:37,738 --> 00:26:39,698
AN UNDERGROUND RAILWAY

416
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,700
HERE IN NEW YORK,

417
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,784
I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST

418
00:26:42,784 --> 00:26:45,370
TO SUPPORT IT,

419
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,289
RAISE MONEY,

420
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:51,043
INVEST IN IT.

421
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:54,046
AND I BECAME FAR WEALTHIER

422
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:55,130
THAN I HAD EVER IMAGINED

423
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,883
I WOULD BE.

424
00:26:57,883 --> 00:26:59,218
I COULD PROVIDE FOR MY WIFE

425
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:05,057
AND MY SON, AND...

426
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:08,060
MY SON, JOHN.

427
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,354
( crowd reacts happily )

428
00:27:10,354 --> 00:27:14,691
( applause )

429
00:27:22,366 --> 00:27:24,242
I WAS THE PROUDEST MAN

430
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:28,413
IN NEW YORK, ZACHARY,

431
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:29,498
AND THERE WERE VERY MANY

432
00:27:29,498 --> 00:27:32,376
PROUD MEN HERE.

433
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:44,763
IT WAS THE GREATEST NIGHT

434
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:48,600
OF MY LIFE.

435
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,354
WE WERE GOING TO THE OPERA...

436
00:27:52,354 --> 00:27:57,776
BUT THE SHADOW ZONE BECKONED.

437
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:02,948
HIS NAME WAS BARNABAS.

438
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:04,032
HE WAS MORE THAN

439
00:28:04,032 --> 00:28:08,120
A THOUSAND YEARS OLD

440
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,955
AND HAD WALKED

441
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,039
THE WORLD

442
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,459
FOR FIFTY GENERATIONS,

443
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:18,046
SEEN SO MUCH,

444
00:28:18,046 --> 00:28:22,259
KNOWN SO MANY GREAT MINDS.

445
00:28:22,259 --> 00:28:24,094
( man groaning )

446
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:46,325
THAT EVENING...

447
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:50,495
THAT EVENING WAS THE LAST TIME

448
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:53,623
I SAW MY SON.

449
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:00,672
WELL, WHICH ONE'S BARNABAS?

450
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:05,177
HE IS NO MORE.

451
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:07,012
HE WASN'T, UH...

452
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:08,096
CONTENT WITH LIFE

453
00:29:08,096 --> 00:29:10,182
HERE UNDER THE STREETS.

454
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,351
HE SOUGHT ESCAPE

455
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:14,978
INTO THE LIGHT OF DAY.

456
00:29:14,978 --> 00:29:16,772
I WASN'T QUICK ENOUGH

457
00:29:16,772 --> 00:29:20,025
TO SAVE HIM, AND...

458
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,109
WELL, YOU SAW WHAT

459
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:22,194
HAPPENED TO DWAYNE.

460
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:26,156
YEAH. UNFORTUNATELY.

461
00:29:26,156 --> 00:29:27,199
WELL, YOU SEE,

462
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,283
DWAYNE WASN'T IN THE LIGHT

463
00:29:28,283 --> 00:29:29,367
LONG ENOUGH FOR THE EFFECTS

464
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:30,410
TO BE PERMANENT,

465
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,495
BUT THERE ARE OTHERS

466
00:29:31,495 --> 00:29:32,662
WHO WEREN'T SO LUCKY.

467
00:29:32,662 --> 00:29:33,705
YOU MEAN WHAT HAPPENED

468
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:34,790
TO DWAYNE HAPPENED TO THEM?

469
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,874
WELL, IT...

470
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:39,169
HELPS EASE THE OVERCROWDING.

471
00:29:39,169 --> 00:29:40,921
THAT'S ONE WAY TO LOOK AT IT.

472
00:29:40,921 --> 00:29:45,884
ZACHARY, THEY WERE FOOLS.

473
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:48,387
WHY RISK LOSING THE POWER,

474
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:52,891
THE MYSTERY, THE NIGHT?

475
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:55,393
BLOOD.

476
00:29:55,393 --> 00:30:01,942
BLOOD IS OUR FOOD, OUR DRINK.

477
00:30:01,942 --> 00:30:04,402
AND IMMORTALITY

478
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:08,240
IS OUR PRIZE.

479
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,367
IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.

480
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:15,247
A RAT!

481
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:17,833
THERE'S A RAT!

482
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:22,087
( vampires clamoring )

483
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:25,590
LADIES FIRST! HA HA!

484
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,633
LEMME HAVE IT!

485
00:30:26,633 --> 00:30:27,717
I'LL PAY YOU TWICE

486
00:30:27,717 --> 00:30:29,553
WHAT YOU WERE OFFERED!

487
00:30:29,553 --> 00:30:32,556
( vampires moaning )

488
00:30:39,229 --> 00:30:41,606
YOU NEEDN'T WORRY, MY FRIEND.

489
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:44,192
I TOLD YOU-- I'M PROTECTING YOU.

490
00:30:44,192 --> 00:30:45,902
THANKS.

491
00:30:45,902 --> 00:30:49,239
CAN I-- WHERE CAN I GET OFF AT?

492
00:30:49,239 --> 00:30:50,282
THIS CAR RUNS ON

493
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:52,284
VERY OLD TRACKS.

494
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:53,326
NO ONE EVEN REMEMBERS

495
00:30:53,326 --> 00:30:54,536
THEY'RE HERE.

496
00:30:54,536 --> 00:30:55,620
SO, HOW DO YOU GET FRESH--?

497
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,789
OH, PEOPLE GET LOST.

498
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:58,874
THAT CORRIDOR

499
00:30:58,874 --> 00:31:01,126
WHERE YOU MET DWAYNE

500
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:03,044
HAS PROVED TO BE VERY FRUITFUL.

501
00:31:03,044 --> 00:31:05,630
SO THEY GET LOST, AND YOU...?

502
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,133

503
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:11,887
I, UH, I MUCH PREFER RATS.

504
00:31:11,887 --> 00:31:14,931
PEOPLE ARE TOO, UH... RICH.

505
00:31:14,931 --> 00:31:15,974
I'M SORT OF

506
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:19,144
A "VAMPIRE VEGETARIAN."

507
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:22,230
BUT, UH...?

508
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,982
OH, THEM?

509
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:27,235
OH, THEY... THEY MUCH PREFER

510
00:31:27,235 --> 00:31:29,654
HUMAN BLOOD.

511
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:30,739
WHY ARE YOU--

512
00:31:30,739 --> 00:31:31,823

513
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,783
I MEAN, PROTECTING ME

514
00:31:33,783 --> 00:31:35,327
FROM THEM?

515
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:37,579
I WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

516
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:38,663
I HAVE TO KNOW WHETHER

517
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:41,458
IT'S DAY OR NIGHT,

518
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:44,336
AND I CAN'T GO

519
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:46,004
UNLESS AN INNOCENT

520
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:48,673
LEADS ME OUT.

521
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,509
AND YOU, MY FRIEND,

522
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:53,845
ARE GOING TO BE THAT PERSON.

523
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:11,863
( vampires moaning )

524
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:15,075
NO! NO!

525
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:21,206
CONDEMNED BY HIS OWN MOUTH!

526
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:22,249
( vampires clamoring )

527
00:32:22,249 --> 00:32:24,709
( bell dings )

528
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,878
AAAHHH!

529
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,964
( brakes screech )

530
00:32:28,964 --> 00:32:32,008
( vampires clamoring )

531
00:33:57,719 --> 00:34:01,765
( indistinct comments )

532
00:34:01,765 --> 00:34:06,728
( vagrants coughing )

533
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,327
DAD!

534
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:24,829
( faint chuckle )

535
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:25,872
YOU SCARED ME.

536
00:34:25,872 --> 00:34:26,956
YOU SCARED THE HELL

537
00:34:26,956 --> 00:34:28,166
OUTTA ME TOO! WHAT'S UP?

538
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,334
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE

539
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:30,460
TILL TOMORROW. YOU ALL RIGHT?

540
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,170
Y-YEAH. I WAS ON THE SUBWAY.

541
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,254
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE

542
00:34:33,254 --> 00:34:35,507
THE RIDE I HAD.

543
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:36,591
SUBWAY?

544
00:34:36,591 --> 00:34:38,343
AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT?

545
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:41,346
YEAH. THERE WAS THIS GUY.

546
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:43,598
GUY? WHAT DID HE DO?

547
00:34:43,598 --> 00:34:45,350
DID HE TOUCH YOU?

548
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,851
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HAND?

549
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:49,354
I-I CUT IT. IT'S FINE.

550
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:52,357
NO, DAD, HE WAS A VAMPIRE.

551
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:55,360
HE HAD THE TEETH AND THE CAPE.

552
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,444
VAMPIRE?

553
00:34:56,444 --> 00:34:58,029
YEAH, THEY WERE ALL VAMPIRES,

554
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,781
THE WHOLE CAR.

555
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:00,865
THEY KEEP GOING ROUND

556
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,367
AND ROUND UNDER THE CITY.

557
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:03,451
DID YOU RENT ONE OF

558
00:35:03,451 --> 00:35:06,454
THOSE HORROR MOVIES?

559
00:35:06,454 --> 00:35:09,374
MY BACKPACK.

560
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:10,458
I LEFT MY BACKPACK

561
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:11,876
ON THE SUBWAY.

562
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:12,961
ZACH, DO YOU KNOW

563
00:35:12,961 --> 00:35:15,130
WHAT THAT COST?

564
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,214
DAD, I-I'M SORRY.

565
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:18,216
I DIDN'T MEAN TO FORGET IT.

566
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:19,467
IT'S JUST... LISTEN, I'M TRYING

567
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:20,552
TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO YOU.

568
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:21,636
I'VE TRIED TO TELL YOU

569
00:35:21,636 --> 00:35:22,720
A MILLION TIMES-- YOU GET ON

570
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,763
THE CAR THAT HAS

571
00:35:23,763 --> 00:35:24,889
THE CONDUCTOR IN IT.

572
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:25,932
SOMEBODY BOTHERS YOU,

573
00:35:25,932 --> 00:35:27,016
YOU TELL HIM. HE'S THERE

574
00:35:27,016 --> 00:35:28,059
TO PROTECT KIDS.

575
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:29,144
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU

576
00:35:29,144 --> 00:35:30,228
SOMETHING! I'M NOT A KID!

577
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:31,729
THERE ONLY WAS ONE CAR!

578
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:32,772
AND THE CONDUCTOR,

579
00:35:32,772 --> 00:35:35,400
HE WAS ONE OF THEM-- THE UNDEAD.

580
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,735
DON'T START, ZACH.

581
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:37,944
THERE ISN'T A TRAIN ON THE WHOLE

582
00:35:37,944 --> 00:35:39,028
NEW YORK SUBWAY SYSTEM

583
00:35:39,028 --> 00:35:40,071
THAT HAS ONE CAR.

584
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,156
HEY, STAY RIGHT HERE--

585
00:35:41,156 --> 00:35:42,240
THIS ISN'T OVER YET!

586
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,283
( telephone rings )

587
00:35:43,283 --> 00:35:44,367
HELLO?

588
00:35:44,367 --> 00:35:46,453
YEAH, HE JUST GOT IN.

589
00:35:46,453 --> 00:35:47,537
HE MET SOME WEIRDO

590
00:35:47,537 --> 00:35:50,415
ON THE SUBWAY.

591
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:52,083
CAB?

592
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,168
WHAT, YOU MOVE UPTOWN,

593
00:35:53,168 --> 00:35:54,252
YOU'RE TOO GOOD FOR

594
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,588
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION?

595
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:58,590
NO, THAT WASN'T A CRACK.

596
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,674
LOOK, WHEN ZACH HAS

597
00:35:59,674 --> 00:36:00,759
AN "UP" WEEKEND,

598
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:01,801
YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE.

599
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:02,886
HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE

600
00:36:02,886 --> 00:36:03,928
A DAY EARLY.

601
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,013
YEAH, AND ANOTHER THING--

602
00:36:05,013 --> 00:36:06,097
WHAT'S THIS THING

603
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,432
WITH THE, UH, THE VAMPIRES.

604
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:08,766
HE KEEPS WATCHING THOSE MOVIES.

605
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:10,268
WHAT'D I TELL YOU--?

606
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,352
YEAH. RIGHT. WE'LL TALK

607
00:36:11,352 --> 00:36:12,937
ABOUT IT LATER, AS USUAL.

608
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:15,940
'BYE.

609
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:36,336
AND THEN HE TOOK THE RAT

610
00:36:36,336 --> 00:36:37,629
AND BIT IT RIGHT IN HALF...

611
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:38,713
( makes slurping noise )

612
00:36:38,713 --> 00:36:39,923
AND STARTED SUCKING THE BLOOD.

613
00:36:39,923 --> 00:36:40,965
IT WAS REALLY COOL.

614
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,634
( Gabe sighs )

615
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:44,802
WHAT? NO, COME ON, TELL ME.

616
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:46,471
LOOK, ZACH, WE KNOW

617
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:47,972
THAT YOU EXAGGERATE THINGS.

618
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:49,307
EXAGGERATE?

619
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:50,517
WE KNOW YOU'RE STILL SHOOK UP

620
00:36:50,517 --> 00:36:51,601
BECAUSE YOUR MOM AND DAD

621
00:36:51,601 --> 00:36:52,644
BROKE UP. I MEAN, THAT'S

622
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:53,728
WHAT THEY SAY ON ALL

623
00:36:53,728 --> 00:36:54,812
THE TALK SHOWS.

624
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:55,855
WE KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A LOUSY

625
00:36:55,855 --> 00:36:56,940
TIME WHEN YOU GO TO YOUR MOM'S,

626
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,024
AND WE DON'T MIND THAT YOU LIE

627
00:36:58,024 --> 00:36:59,275
TO US ABOUT IT.

628
00:36:59,275 --> 00:37:00,777
ALL RIGHT. MAYBE I DO...

629
00:37:00,777 --> 00:37:03,488
EXAGGERATE ABOUT THINGS. BUT...

630
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:04,989
YOU LIE LIKE A RUG.

631
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:09,577
( school bell rings )

632
00:37:09,577 --> 00:37:10,662
THIS IS DIFFERENT!

633
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:12,372
I SWEAR, IT REALLY HAPPENED!

634
00:37:12,372 --> 00:37:13,456
I GOT IN THE SUBWAY,

635
00:37:13,456 --> 00:37:15,083
AND THEY WERE ALL VAMPIRES!

636
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:19,003
DID YOU DO THE RESEARCH?

637
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:20,505
YOU DIDN'T, DID YOU?

638
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:21,589
ZACH, I THOUGHT YOU SAID

639
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:23,174
YOUR MOM HAD THE BOOKS!

640
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,259
I HAD MY CAMERA READY

641
00:37:24,259 --> 00:37:25,426
AND EVERYTHING!

642
00:37:25,426 --> 00:37:26,511
IF I FAIL HISTORY

643
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:27,554
BECAUSE YOU WENT OFF TO GO--

644
00:37:27,554 --> 00:37:29,973
NO, NO! I GOT AN IDEA.

645
00:37:29,973 --> 00:37:31,266
HISTORY OF NEW YORK, RIGHT?

646
00:37:31,266 --> 00:37:32,350
WHAT'S MORE NEW YORK

647
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,643
THAN THE SUBWAYS?

648
00:37:33,643 --> 00:37:34,686
WE CAN DO OUR PROJECTS

649
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:35,728
IN THE OLD SUBWAYS

650
00:37:35,728 --> 00:37:36,813
UNDER THE CITY.

651
00:37:36,813 --> 00:37:38,356
COME ON, ZACH.

652
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:39,440
NO, NO. THE OLD CITY HALL

653
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,192
STATION, I KNOW WHERE IT IS,

654
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:43,653
AND I KNOW HOW TO GET IN TOO.

655
00:37:43,653 --> 00:37:44,696
Y-YOU COULD TAKE PICTURES.

656
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:45,780
IT'S UTTERLY COOL.

657
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,448
YOU GOTTA SEE IT.

658
00:37:47,448 --> 00:37:49,200
I'LL EVEN DO THE WRITE-UP.

659
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,994
THAT DOES SOUND COOL.

660
00:37:50,994 --> 00:37:52,245
YOU REALLY KNOW

661
00:37:52,245 --> 00:37:53,329
HOW TO GET IN?

662
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:55,415
I SWEAR.

663
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,213
HERE?

664
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,298
YEAH. IT'S THE ONLY WAY IN

665
00:38:03,298 --> 00:38:06,301
I KNOW.

666
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:18,748
HOLY COW.

667
00:39:18,748 --> 00:39:19,791
NICE PLACE YOU'VE GOT HERE,

668
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:20,875
ZACH. I LOVE WHAT YOU'VE

669
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:23,127
DONE WITH IT.

670
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:29,550
AMBER AND I ARE DOING OUR

671
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,635
PROJECT ON THE HISTORY OF

672
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:32,136
SANITATION WORKERS.

673
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,221
IT STINKS.

674
00:39:33,221 --> 00:39:36,224
( camera flash whirrs )

675
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:39,560
SHH.

676
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,979
( distant clanking sound )

677
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:43,189
WHAT, ZACH, ARE WE LISTENING

678
00:39:43,189 --> 00:39:44,816
FOR THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT?

679
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:45,858
OR THE PITTER-PATTER

680
00:39:45,858 --> 00:39:48,319
OF LITTLE WINGS?

681
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,154
YOU KNOW, I WASN'T LYING.

682
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:51,197
YOU KNOW, FRIENDS SHOULD

683
00:39:51,197 --> 00:39:53,324
BELIEVE FRIENDS.

684
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:54,409
WEIRDOS, I BUY.

685
00:39:54,409 --> 00:39:55,910
WHO WOULDN'T?

686
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,537
BUT VAMPIRES?

687
00:39:57,537 --> 00:39:58,997
COME ON, GIVE ME A BREAK.

688
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:00,081
YOU WAIT. I MEAN,

689
00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:01,165
I'LL BET THEY'RE AROUND HERE

690
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:02,583
RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW,

691
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:03,668
ALL THEY DO IS RIDE AROUND

692
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:04,711
UNDER NEW YORK

693
00:40:04,711 --> 00:40:08,840
ON THE FORGOTTEN TRACKS.

694
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,508
AAH!

695
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:11,592
I FORGOT! I WAS SUPPOSED

696
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:13,010
TO MEET AMBER AFTER SCHOOL!

697
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,179
AW, SHE'S GONNA KILL ME.

698
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,222
YEAH, AND I'VE GOT

699
00:40:16,222 --> 00:40:17,390
TO BABYSIT.

700
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:20,184
UM, YOU COMING?

701
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:21,686
NO. I THINK I'M JUST

702
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:22,770
GONNA WAIT AND TAKE SOME

703
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,439
PICTURES OF THE VAMPIRES

704
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:25,648
'CAUSE IF YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME,

705
00:40:25,648 --> 00:40:26,691
MAYBE YOU'LL BELIEVE

706
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:27,775
YOUR OWN EYES.

707
00:40:27,775 --> 00:40:28,860
IT'S UP TO YOU.

708
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,902
YOU KNOW HOW MY MOM GETS.

709
00:40:29,902 --> 00:40:31,028
MAYBE I WON'T EVEN SHOW YOU

710
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:32,196
THE PICTURES! MAYBE I'LL SELL

711
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:33,281
'EM TO THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER

712
00:40:33,281 --> 00:40:34,699
AND MAKE A BUNCH OF DOUGH.

713
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:35,783
YOU'LL HAVE TO PAY TO SEE 'EM,

714
00:40:35,783 --> 00:40:37,535
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

715
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:40,371
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

716
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:41,414
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT AFRAID

717
00:40:41,414 --> 00:40:43,666
TO BE DOWN HERE BY MYSELF.

718
00:40:43,666 --> 00:40:45,376
DOESN'T SCARE ME.

719
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,878
NOPE, NOT ONE BIT.

720
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:49,547
( scoffs ) WHO'S SCARED, ME?

721
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:52,884
YEAH.

722
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:01,976
PRETTY FUNNY, HUH?

723
00:41:01,976 --> 00:41:03,061
ZACH TRYING TO CONVINCE US

724
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:04,395
WE SAW VAMPIRES?

725
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:05,480
YEAH, HE USUALLY DOESN'T

726
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,564
CARRY HIS STORIES

727
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:07,899
ON FOR SO LONG.

728
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:08,983
THERE'S NO SUCH THING

729
00:41:08,983 --> 00:41:10,068
AS VAMPIRES, RIGHT?

730
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:11,694
HEY, I SHOULD KNOW?

731
00:41:11,694 --> 00:41:13,404
SO THERE COULD BE.

732
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:17,200
I'M NOT THE ONE TO ASK.

733
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,242
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING

734
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:21,496
ON THE 'NET.

735
00:41:21,496 --> 00:41:24,499
( eerie scraping sound )

736
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:33,758
( small wings fluttering )

737
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:36,761
WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

738
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:49,273
AAH! AAAHHH!

739
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,363
GEEZ, HARV, YOU SCARED ME.

740
00:41:55,363 --> 00:41:59,617
MAKES US EVEN.

741
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,953
HEY... WHAT'S UP?

742
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:02,995
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'VE

743
00:42:02,995 --> 00:42:04,080
SEEN A GHOST.

744
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,915
NO, A VAMPIRE.

745
00:42:05,915 --> 00:42:07,583
WHAT?!

746
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:09,126
FORGET IT.

747
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:10,586
WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN HERE?

748
00:42:10,586 --> 00:42:14,298
HEY... IT DON'T RAIN.

749
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:16,634
THERE'S NO COPS.

750
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:20,304
AND IT'S... IT'S REAL QUIET.

751
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:26,644
LISTEN, ZACH,

752
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:27,979
UM, I'M A LITTLE SHORT

753
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:30,106
RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW?

754
00:42:30,106 --> 00:42:31,232
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD...?

755
00:42:31,232 --> 00:42:34,777
WHAT?

756
00:42:34,777 --> 00:42:35,820
YEAH, SURE.

757
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,157
LET ME SEE WHAT I GOT.

758
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:45,830
THANKS, ZACH.

759
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:46,914
THIS IS JUST UNTIL

760
00:42:46,914 --> 00:42:47,999
MR. CHAN PAYS ME

761
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:52,670
FOR SWEEPING UP.

762
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:56,007
NOW, YOU BE CAREFUL DOWN HERE.

763
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:59,010
I'LL SEE YOU, LITTLE PAL.

764
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:04,599
GREAT. ALL I NEED

765
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:07,643
IS TO BREAK GABE'S CAMERA.

766
00:43:20,948 --> 00:43:22,700
THAT'S ALL I GOT, HARV.

767
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,784
CATCH ME TOMORROW.

768
00:43:23,784 --> 00:43:24,869
BUT I'VE ALREADY

769
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,037
CAUGHT YOU...

770
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:28,873
TODAY!

771
00:43:28,873 --> 00:43:31,125
( eerie fluttering )

772
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:32,376
COME ON!

773
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:35,463
STAY STILL!

774
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:44,430
YOURS, I BELIEVE.

775
00:43:56,067 --> 00:44:00,863
AND MINE.

776
00:44:00,863 --> 00:44:03,199
GO FIND A RAT.

777
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,202
I WANT HUMAN BLOOD!

778
00:44:06,202 --> 00:44:08,412
YOU ARE HOLDING ME BACK!

779
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:10,998
I COMMAND YOU.

780
00:44:22,051 --> 00:44:25,054
( low snarl )

781
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:33,354
HE WAS... I WAS DINNER.

782
00:44:33,354 --> 00:44:35,606
( Valentine clicks heel )

783
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:38,609
MM-HMM.

784
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:42,613
ZACH, I'M HURT.

785
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:45,783
I TOLD YOU I'D PROTECT YOU.

786
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:47,284
I REMEMBER.

787
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:49,787
I JUST... DON'T BELIEVE IT.

788
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:52,289
MM-HMM.

789
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:55,793
I THINK THIS IS YOURS.

790
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:57,545
EVERYTHING THERE?

791
00:44:57,545 --> 00:44:59,296
YEAH. THANKS.

792
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:00,381
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU

793
00:45:00,381 --> 00:45:01,924
BELIEVE ME?

794
00:45:01,924 --> 00:45:02,967
YOU'RE A VAMPIRE.

795
00:45:02,967 --> 00:45:04,969
WHY SHOULD I BELIEVE YOU?

796
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:07,972
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

797
00:45:07,972 --> 00:45:13,811
HMM.

798
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:16,313
THAT'S THE FIRST RULE:

799
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:17,898
TRUST NO ONE,

800
00:45:17,898 --> 00:45:19,817
NOT EVEN YOUR CLOSEST FRIENDS.

801
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:20,901
WELL, NO.

802
00:45:20,901 --> 00:45:22,528
I TRUST GABE AND J.T.

803
00:45:22,528 --> 00:45:24,155
I'VE KNOWN THEM FOREVER.

804
00:45:24,155 --> 00:45:25,990
MMM.

805
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,074
WELL, FOREVER'S

806
00:45:27,074 --> 00:45:29,660
A LONG TIME, ZACH.

807
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,745
DO THEY TRUST YOU?

808
00:45:30,745 --> 00:45:33,873
OF COURSE!

809
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:40,379
WELL... I TOLD 'EM

810
00:45:40,379 --> 00:45:42,214
ABOUT YOU, AND...

811
00:45:42,214 --> 00:45:44,050
THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE ME.

812
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:45,384
BUT, WHAT? I MEAN,

813
00:45:45,384 --> 00:45:47,595
YOU ARE PRETTY UNBELIEVABLE.

814
00:45:47,595 --> 00:45:52,725
A FRIEND... WOULD BELIEVE...

815
00:45:52,725 --> 00:45:59,398
NO MATTER WHAT.

816
00:45:59,398 --> 00:46:03,069
VALENTINE, WAIT...

817
00:46:03,069 --> 00:46:04,111
ME AND MY FRIEND GABE

818
00:46:04,111 --> 00:46:05,196
ARE DOING A PROJECT

819
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:07,073
IN HISTORY TOGETHER.

820
00:46:07,073 --> 00:46:08,741
UM... IT'S ABOUT THE--

821
00:46:08,741 --> 00:46:09,784
THE OLD SUBWAY.

822
00:46:09,784 --> 00:46:12,578
ACTUALLY, YOU GAVE ME THE IDEA.

823
00:46:12,578 --> 00:46:15,414
I DID?

824
00:46:15,414 --> 00:46:21,587
OH. I'M DELIGHTED.

825
00:46:21,587 --> 00:46:23,089
PERHAPS I CAN HELP.

826
00:46:23,089 --> 00:46:24,924
WELL, SURE, YEAH.

827
00:46:24,924 --> 00:46:26,383
UM... I'M DOING THE RESEARCH

828
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:27,426
RIGHT NOW. SEE, I DO

829
00:46:27,426 --> 00:46:28,511
THE WRITE-UP,

830
00:46:28,511 --> 00:46:30,763
AND GABE TAKES THE PICTURES.

831
00:46:30,763 --> 00:46:33,557
MM.

832
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,601
YOU SAY YOUR FRIEND...

833
00:46:35,601 --> 00:46:37,812
GABE... TAKES A FEW PICTURES,

834
00:46:37,812 --> 00:46:38,896
AND YOU HAVE TO DO

835
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:42,108
ALL THE WRITING?

836
00:46:42,108 --> 00:46:44,610
DOESN'T SOUND FAIR.

837
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:48,280
WELL, SHE DEVELOPS THEM TOO.

838
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,907
SHE'S DYSLEXIC.

839
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:52,785
AH. FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY,

840
00:46:52,785 --> 00:46:54,620
IS SHE?

841
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:58,124
NO, NO. UM...

842
00:46:58,124 --> 00:46:59,166
IT MEANS SHE HAS TROUBLE

843
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:00,292
WITH READING AND WRITING.

844
00:47:00,292 --> 00:47:02,294
I SEE.

845
00:47:02,294 --> 00:47:03,337
WELL, IT'S FORTUNATE

846
00:47:03,337 --> 00:47:04,421
SHE HAS A FRIEND SHE CAN

847
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:05,714
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF.

848
00:47:05,714 --> 00:47:09,301
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT. SHE...

849
00:47:09,301 --> 00:47:11,554
I HAVE A SPLENDID IDEA.

850
00:47:11,554 --> 00:47:12,638
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE

851
00:47:12,638 --> 00:47:14,598
OTHER ABANDONED STATIONS?

852
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:16,642
THERE'S MORE?

853
00:47:16,642 --> 00:47:19,437
OH, YES, MANY MORE.

854
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:20,980
AND I CAN GET TO THEM.

855
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,106
WELL, COOL. I MEAN,

856
00:47:22,106 --> 00:47:23,149
CAN GABE COME TOO?

857
00:47:23,149 --> 00:47:24,275
SHE HAS TO TAKE THE PICTURES.

858
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:25,484
NO.

859
00:47:25,484 --> 00:47:27,987
NO, NO, NO.

860
00:47:27,987 --> 00:47:31,198
NO. ONLY YOU, ZACHARY.

861
00:47:31,198 --> 00:47:34,618
I TRUST ONLY YOU.

862
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:37,204
( sighs ) WELL, I MEAN...

863
00:47:37,204 --> 00:47:38,497
I DON'T KNOW... I DON'T THINK

864
00:47:38,497 --> 00:47:40,082
MY DAD WOULD LET ME.

865
00:47:40,082 --> 00:47:43,502
OH, ZACHARY.

866
00:47:43,502 --> 00:47:46,172
LESSON NUMBER TWO:

867
00:47:46,172 --> 00:47:48,174
YOU SHOULD NEVER,

868
00:47:48,174 --> 00:47:51,677
NEVER HAVE TO GET PERMISSION

869
00:47:51,677 --> 00:47:54,513
TO LIVE.

870
00:47:54,513 --> 00:47:57,683
WELL, I HAVE TO GET GOING.

871
00:47:57,683 --> 00:48:01,604
MY TRAINMATES MUST BE WANDERING.

872
00:48:01,604 --> 00:48:03,022
IF YOU WANT THE TOUR,

873
00:48:03,022 --> 00:48:05,357
I'LL MEET YOU HERE TOMORROW.

874
00:48:05,357 --> 00:48:09,278
WHAT? WAIT-- WHAT TIME?

875
00:48:09,278 --> 00:48:11,030
OH, I'LL KNOW WHEN

876
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:16,994
TO COME TO YOU.

877
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:18,037
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

878
00:48:18,037 --> 00:48:21,415
( snarling growl )

879
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:28,172
I DIDN'T MEAN...

880
00:48:28,172 --> 00:48:29,548
I WAS, UH...

881
00:48:29,548 --> 00:48:34,887
JUST SURPRISED, THAT'S ALL.

882
00:48:34,887 --> 00:48:37,223
I'M SORRY.

883
00:48:37,223 --> 00:48:40,226
I MEAN, I SHOULD HAVE ASKED.

884
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:46,982
VALENTINE?

885
00:48:46,982 --> 00:48:48,984
( small wings fluttering )

886
00:48:48,984 --> 00:48:50,569
VALENTINE?

887
00:48:50,569 --> 00:48:51,612
( small creatures

888
00:48:51,612 --> 00:48:54,573
chittering )

889
00:49:09,755 --> 00:49:11,257
BOO!

890
00:49:11,257 --> 00:49:12,758
MESSED UP!

891
00:49:12,758 --> 00:49:16,929
REALLY MATURE, ZACH.

892
00:49:16,929 --> 00:49:18,264
NOTHING.

893
00:49:18,264 --> 00:49:19,306
WELL, I'M CONVINCED.

894
00:49:19,306 --> 00:49:20,391
WELL, I KNOW I TOOK

895
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:21,433
THE PICTURE OF HIM.

896
00:49:21,433 --> 00:49:22,518
I ALREADY GOT A SHOT OF

897
00:49:22,518 --> 00:49:26,313
THE SIGN, AND A BETTER ONE TOO.

898
00:49:30,276 --> 00:49:32,152
THAT PROVES IT.

899
00:49:32,152 --> 00:49:34,029
HE'S NOT IN THE PICTURE.

900
00:49:34,029 --> 00:49:35,114
WHAT?

901
00:49:35,114 --> 00:49:36,156
IT PROVES THAT HE'S

902
00:49:36,156 --> 00:49:37,283
A VAMPIRE. I AIMED THE CAMERA

903
00:49:37,283 --> 00:49:39,076
RIGHT AT HIM, LIKE THIS,

904
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:40,703
AND HE WASN'T IN THE PICTURE.

905
00:49:40,703 --> 00:49:41,704
THEY DON'T SHOW UP ON FILM.

906
00:49:41,704 --> 00:49:42,705
THAT PROVES IT.

907
00:49:42,705 --> 00:49:44,415
AND IT'S OUT OF FOCUS.

908
00:49:44,415 --> 00:49:45,457
I KNOW IT'S OUT OF FOCUS.

909
00:49:45,457 --> 00:49:46,542
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE I HAD

910
00:49:46,542 --> 00:49:47,626
ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD.

911
00:49:47,626 --> 00:49:48,669
I MEAN, HE WAS LEAVING--

912
00:49:48,669 --> 00:49:49,753
I HAD TO TAKE IT.

913
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:50,838
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY

914
00:49:50,838 --> 00:49:51,922
ONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO TAKE

915
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:53,632
PICTURES.

916
00:49:53,632 --> 00:49:54,675
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS

917
00:49:54,675 --> 00:49:57,261
OUTSIDE.

918
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,983
HE WAS THERE.

919
00:50:10,983 --> 00:50:12,318
ZACH, GIVE IT A REST.

920
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:15,154
I MEAN, I TOOK HIS PICTURE.

921
00:50:15,154 --> 00:50:16,822
I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH HIM.

922
00:50:16,822 --> 00:50:18,240
A VAMPIRE?   YEAH.

923
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,408
LOOK, ZACH, EVERY SO OFTEN,

924
00:50:19,408 --> 00:50:20,576
YOUR LIES ARE FUN, OKAY?

925
00:50:20,576 --> 00:50:22,995
BUT THIS ONE ISN'T.

926
00:50:22,995 --> 00:50:24,663
( scoffs ) LIES?

927
00:50:24,663 --> 00:50:25,706
YES, LIKE ABOUT MEETING

928
00:50:25,706 --> 00:50:27,333
SOME CELEBRITY, OR GETTING

929
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:29,376
TICKETS TO A SOLD-OUT GAME,

930
00:50:29,376 --> 00:50:30,502
OR GOING ON A SAFARI TO AFRICA

931
00:50:30,502 --> 00:50:31,962
WITH YOUR MOTHER.

932
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:33,130
SHE IS!

933
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,173
ZACH, SHE CALLED MY MOM.

934
00:50:34,173 --> 00:50:35,257
SHE WANTS TO TAKE YOU

935
00:50:35,257 --> 00:50:36,675
TO SAFARI WORLD IN FLORIDA.

936
00:50:36,675 --> 00:50:38,177
SHE ASKED IF I COULD GO!

937
00:50:38,177 --> 00:50:39,637
SHE ASKED IF YOU COULD GO?

938
00:50:39,637 --> 00:50:41,263
ALL RIGHT, SO MAYBE SOMETIMES

939
00:50:41,263 --> 00:50:42,348
I EXAGGERATE A LITTLE,

940
00:50:42,348 --> 00:50:44,141
BUT THIS IS FOR REAL.

941
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:45,809
I'D LIKE TO SEE SAFARI WORLD.

942
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:46,977
LOOK, ZACH, YOU MET SOME GUY

943
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:48,020
AND HE TRIED TO SCARE YOU.

944
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,104
THAT I'LL BUY, OKAY?

945
00:50:49,104 --> 00:50:50,147
BUT YOU HAVE TO GO

946
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:51,190
AND BLOW IT UP INTO SOMETHING

947
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:52,274
BIGGER AND BETTER THAN

948
00:50:52,274 --> 00:50:53,359
IT REALLY IS. MEANWHILE,

949
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:54,401
WE HAVE A HISTORY PROJECT

950
00:50:54,401 --> 00:50:55,569
DUE NEXT WEEK, AND YOU HAVEN'T

951
00:50:55,569 --> 00:50:56,987
EVEN DONE ANYTHING YET.

952
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:58,364
THE SUBWAY WAS MY IDEA!

953
00:50:58,364 --> 00:50:59,823
SO WHAT?

954
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:00,866
MY MOM WOULD LET ME GO.

955
00:51:00,866 --> 00:51:01,950
LOOK, ZACH, IT WAS A GOOD

956
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:03,035
IDEA, OKAY, BUT YOU'VE GOT

957
00:51:03,035 --> 00:51:04,244
TO FOLLOW THROUGH.

958
00:51:04,244 --> 00:51:05,454
I SPENT TWO HOURS IN THE LIBRARY

959
00:51:05,454 --> 00:51:06,663
THIS AFTERNOON DOING RESEARCH

960
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:08,082
AND KEEPING MY BROTHER QUIET,

961
00:51:08,082 --> 00:51:09,249
AND YOU WERE IN SOME ABANDONED

962
00:51:09,249 --> 00:51:10,334
SUBWAY STATION TALKING

963
00:51:10,334 --> 00:51:11,377
TO SOME GEEK.

964
00:51:11,377 --> 00:51:12,461
ZACH, MAYBE IF YOUR MOM

965
00:51:12,461 --> 00:51:14,546
CALLED MY MOM--

966
00:51:14,546 --> 00:51:18,342
Both: SHUT UP!

967
00:51:18,342 --> 00:51:20,094
LOOK, I TOOK THE PICTURE!

968
00:51:20,094 --> 00:51:21,178
ONE PICTURE, AND IT'S

969
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:22,221
OUT OF FOCUS!

970
00:51:22,221 --> 00:51:23,305
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF NERVE.

971
00:51:23,305 --> 00:51:24,390
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

972
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:25,432
IS TAKE PICTURES.

973
00:51:25,432 --> 00:51:26,517
I'VE GOT THE HARD PART.

974
00:51:26,517 --> 00:51:32,689
JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN'T WRITE...!

975
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:33,732
I didn't know you felt

976
00:51:33,732 --> 00:51:34,817
that way.

977
00:51:34,817 --> 00:51:36,360
WELL... WELL, I DO.

978
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,403
WELL, THEN, MAYBE WE

979
00:51:37,403 --> 00:51:39,238
SHOULDN'T BE PARTNERS, THEN.

980
00:51:39,238 --> 00:51:40,739
WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

981
00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:42,032
FINE, FINE.

982
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:44,576
FINE.

983
00:51:44,576 --> 00:51:45,619
HERE!

984
00:51:45,619 --> 00:51:46,954
AND THESE ARE IN FOCUS!

985
00:51:46,954 --> 00:51:48,038
I DON'T NEED ANYTHING

986
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:49,081
FROM YOU.

987
00:51:49,081 --> 00:51:50,165
AND I NEED EVEN LESS

988
00:51:50,165 --> 00:51:54,253
FROM YOU.

989
00:52:20,279 --> 00:52:23,449
I KNEW YOU'D COME.

990
00:52:23,449 --> 00:52:25,284
YEAH. WELL, I FOUND OUT

991
00:52:25,284 --> 00:52:27,244
WHO MY FRIENDS REALLY ARE.

992
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:29,955
YOU'RE LEARNING.

993
00:52:29,955 --> 00:52:32,124
ZACHARY, THE SECRET OF LIFE

994
00:52:32,124 --> 00:52:34,626
IS TO ACT.

995
00:52:34,626 --> 00:52:36,503
FOLLOW YOUR OWN BLOOD.

996
00:52:36,503 --> 00:52:38,714
TRUST YOURSELF.

997
00:52:38,714 --> 00:52:42,676
DID YOU BRING YOUR CAMERA?

998
00:52:42,676 --> 00:52:44,803
THAT'S EXCELLENT.

999
00:52:44,803 --> 00:52:47,806
LET US BEGIN.

1000
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,529
THIS WAS ALL MINE.

1001
00:53:43,529 --> 00:53:44,571
MY OFFICE USED TO BE

1002
00:53:44,571 --> 00:53:47,032
UP THOSE STAIRS.

1003
00:53:47,032 --> 00:53:48,867
THE BUILDING'S GONE, NOW.

1004
00:53:48,867 --> 00:53:52,037
I HEARD THEM TEARING IT DOWN.

1005
00:54:24,403 --> 00:54:27,406
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

1006
00:54:30,576 --> 00:54:32,911
THIS IS JUST FOR YOU.

1007
00:54:32,911 --> 00:54:34,079
IF PEOPLE WERE TO SEE PICTURES

1008
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,622
OF THIS PLACE, THEY WOULD

1009
00:54:35,622 --> 00:54:37,249
COME LOOKING FOR IT.

1010
00:54:37,249 --> 00:54:40,752
I WANT IT TO REMAIN AS IT IS...

1011
00:54:40,752 --> 00:54:42,129
FOREVER.

1012
00:54:42,129 --> 00:54:45,090
PERFECT.

1013
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:48,427
BEAUTIFUL.

1014
00:54:48,427 --> 00:54:49,469
YEAH, THAT'S OKAY.

1015
00:54:49,469 --> 00:54:52,472
I'VE GOT ENOUGH ALREADY.

1016
00:55:03,692 --> 00:55:05,819
WOULD YOU CARE TO JOIN ME?

1017
00:55:53,492 --> 00:55:55,994
AWESOME!

1018
00:55:55,994 --> 00:55:57,329
BUT WAS IT "COOL"?

1019
00:55:57,329 --> 00:56:00,332
TOTALLY, OFF THE SCALE.

1020
00:56:09,508 --> 00:56:10,550
LISTEN.

1021
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:12,344
( distant indistinct sounds )

1022
00:56:12,344 --> 00:56:16,682
BATS?

1023
00:56:16,682 --> 00:56:21,853
PEOPLE.

1024
00:56:21,853 --> 00:56:24,856
ABOVE US.

1025
00:56:27,693 --> 00:56:32,364
I HEAR THEM WALKING...

1026
00:56:32,364 --> 00:56:37,869
ENJOYING THE CITY...

1027
00:56:37,869 --> 00:56:41,206
LIVING.

1028
00:56:41,206 --> 00:56:42,708
Man: WELCOME HOME!

1029
00:56:42,708 --> 00:56:45,877
EVERY DAY...

1030
00:56:45,877 --> 00:56:51,717
EVERY NIGHT.

1031
00:56:51,717 --> 00:56:56,263
I CAN FEEL THEM.

1032
00:56:56,263 --> 00:57:00,726
Listen, Zachary.

1033
00:57:00,726 --> 00:57:01,768
Can you hear the beating

1034
00:57:01,768 --> 00:57:04,396
of their hearts?

1035
00:57:04,396 --> 00:57:06,523
No, but I'll take

1036
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:09,526
your word for it.

1037
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:13,905
( distant siren wails )

1038
00:57:13,905 --> 00:57:18,243
I want to walk there...

1039
00:57:18,243 --> 00:57:23,749
among them...

1040
00:57:23,749 --> 00:57:26,793
Zachary, is it night?

1041
00:57:26,793 --> 00:57:32,257
Yeah.

1042
00:57:32,257 --> 00:57:33,759
Take me up there.

1043
00:57:33,759 --> 00:57:35,969
UH... THAT'S NEW YORK,

1044
00:57:35,969 --> 00:57:38,263
AND YOU'RE A VAMPIRE.

1045
00:57:38,263 --> 00:57:39,306
I DON'T THINK YOU GUYS

1046
00:57:39,306 --> 00:57:40,390
ARE READY FOR EACH OTHER.

1047
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,267
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

1048
00:57:42,267 --> 00:57:43,310
WHAT?

1049
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:45,604
WE MADE A BARGAIN.

1050
00:57:45,604 --> 00:57:47,773
I SHOWED YOU MY WORLD,

1051
00:57:47,773 --> 00:57:50,108
NOW I WANT YOU TO SHOW ME YOURS.

1052
00:57:50,108 --> 00:57:51,151
I NEVER SAID ANYTHING

1053
00:57:51,151 --> 00:57:52,402
ABOUT TAKING YOU OUT OF HERE.

1054
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:56,114
BUT YOU TOOK WHAT I OFFERED.

1055
00:57:56,114 --> 00:58:00,619
NOW... YOU MUST REPAY.

1056
00:58:00,619 --> 00:58:04,623
ZACHARY, I PROMISE YOU,

1057
00:58:04,623 --> 00:58:08,126
I WON'T HURT ANYBODY.

1058
00:58:08,126 --> 00:58:11,338
I DON'T WANT TO HUNT.

1059
00:58:16,134 --> 00:58:19,304
I just want to see...

1060
00:58:19,304 --> 00:58:22,557
the stars. Please.

1061
00:58:33,318 --> 00:58:37,322
SURE.

1062
00:59:35,714 --> 00:59:38,049
COME ON, IT'S JUST UP AHEAD.

1063
00:59:42,053 --> 00:59:44,222
AND OUT THERE IS, UH...

1064
00:59:44,222 --> 00:59:47,225
NEW YORK. COME ON.

1065
00:59:52,772 --> 00:59:55,775
( sirens wail )

1066
01:00:06,578 --> 01:00:09,080
AHH!

1067
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:12,083
THE LIGHT IS SO SWEET!

1068
01:00:12,083 --> 01:00:13,126
YEAH, MAYBE FOR A GUY

1069
01:00:13,126 --> 01:00:16,129
WHO EATS RATS!

1070
01:00:20,258 --> 01:00:21,301
THANK YOU FOR

1071
01:00:21,301 --> 01:00:25,263
LEADING ME OUT.

1072
01:00:25,263 --> 01:00:28,266
COME ON.

1073
01:00:53,625 --> 01:00:55,961
( indistinct comments )

1074
01:01:00,048 --> 01:01:02,467
( laughter )

1075
01:01:35,583 --> 01:01:36,668
HEY, KID, YOU WANNA BUY

1076
01:01:36,668 --> 01:01:39,671
A WATCH?

1077
01:01:39,671 --> 01:01:42,215
( clocks ringing )

1078
01:01:42,215 --> 01:01:46,011
WHAT'S WITH THE TIMES?

1079
01:01:46,011 --> 01:01:49,180
HEY! HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

1080
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:52,350
WHAT THE...?

1081
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:54,227
WHAT-- WHAT--

1082
01:01:54,227 --> 01:01:58,023
WHAT'D YOU DO TO MY WATCHES?

1083
01:02:04,195 --> 01:02:07,198
THANK YOU, FRIEND ZACHARY.

1084
01:02:07,198 --> 01:02:11,536
THANK YOU, FRIEND VALENTINE.

1085
01:02:11,536 --> 01:02:16,041
WHOA. VALENTINE. LOOK.

1086
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:17,083
SIMS. HE'S GONE

1087
01:02:17,083 --> 01:02:19,044
FROM THE TUNNELS.

1088
01:02:19,044 --> 01:02:20,086
HE MUST HAVE FOLLOWED US

1089
01:02:20,086 --> 01:02:23,006
OUT THE DOOR.

1090
01:02:23,006 --> 01:02:24,049
WE HAVE TO FIND HIM.

1091
01:02:24,049 --> 01:02:25,133
HE'S HUNGRY.

1092
01:02:25,133 --> 01:02:28,887
WELL, WHICH WAY?

1093
01:02:28,887 --> 01:02:32,223
I DON'T KNOW.

1094
01:02:32,223 --> 01:02:40,732
THIS WAY.

1095
01:02:40,732 --> 01:02:41,858
SO, WHERE DO WE LOOK?

1096
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:43,902
THE CEMETERY.

1097
01:02:43,902 --> 01:02:46,696
A PLACE WHERE THERE ARE CRYPTS.

1098
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:48,406
WELL... THERE'S

1099
01:02:48,406 --> 01:02:49,449
TRINITY CHURCH.

1100
01:02:49,449 --> 01:02:50,533
IT'S A COUPLE OF BLOCKS

1101
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:52,619
THAT WAY. LET'S GO.

1102
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:57,499
( distant dog howls )

1103
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:12,097
YOU'RE FAST.

1104
01:03:12,097 --> 01:03:16,768
HE MUST BE HERE SOMEWHERE.

1105
01:03:16,768 --> 01:03:17,811
WELL, WHAT DO WE DO

1106
01:03:17,811 --> 01:03:20,939
WHEN WE FIND HIM?

1107
01:03:20,939 --> 01:03:22,607
VALENTINE?

1108
01:03:22,607 --> 01:03:25,443
VALENTINE?

1109
01:03:25,443 --> 01:03:28,279
VALENTINE?

1110
01:03:28,279 --> 01:03:30,281
VALENTINE!

1111
01:03:30,281 --> 01:03:32,951
VALENTINE!

1112
01:03:36,121 --> 01:03:38,957
WE MEET AGAIN!

1113
01:03:38,957 --> 01:03:42,794
( low growl )

1114
01:03:44,629 --> 01:03:46,172
LEAVE HIM.

1115
01:03:46,172 --> 01:03:48,091
I CAN'T DO THAT!

1116
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:49,134
ALL I'VE EATEN

1117
01:03:49,134 --> 01:03:51,636
IS ONE LOUSY DOG...

1118
01:03:51,636 --> 01:03:54,514
SO FAR! HA HA HA HA!

1119
01:03:57,058 --> 01:04:00,061
( low growl )

1120
01:04:10,238 --> 01:04:12,824
I ORDER YOU...

1121
01:04:12,824 --> 01:04:14,033
TO RETURN!

1122
01:04:14,033 --> 01:04:16,494
NEVER! AAAHHH!

1123
01:04:16,494 --> 01:04:19,873
♪♪

1124
01:04:37,015 --> 01:04:39,350
LISTEN TO ME--

1125
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:43,229
THE DAWN IS COMING.

1126
01:04:43,229 --> 01:04:44,439
WE MUST GO.

1127
01:04:44,439 --> 01:04:45,857
LOOK AROUND!

1128
01:04:45,857 --> 01:04:46,900
THERE ARE MANY PLACES

1129
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:50,778
FOR US TO REST!

1130
01:05:05,043 --> 01:05:09,047
TAKE US HOME, ZACHARY.

1131
01:05:09,047 --> 01:05:13,718
PLEASE.

1132
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:57,929
I SAW A BEAUTIFUL AUTOMOBILE.

1133
01:05:57,929 --> 01:05:58,972
I COULD HAVE BOUGHT IT,

1134
01:05:58,972 --> 01:06:02,433
IF I'D ONLY SOLD SHORT.

1135
01:06:02,433 --> 01:06:06,688
I KNOW.

1136
01:06:36,301 --> 01:06:39,304
( distant dog barks )

1137
01:07:15,173 --> 01:07:17,342
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

1138
01:07:17,342 --> 01:07:19,177
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

1139
01:07:19,177 --> 01:07:21,262
MOM. HI.

1140
01:07:21,262 --> 01:07:22,805
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

1141
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:24,640
WHERE WERE YOU ALL NIGHT?

1142
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,683
I WAS WALKING AROUND

1143
01:07:25,683 --> 01:07:27,185
NEW YORK WITH VALENTINE.

1144
01:07:27,185 --> 01:07:28,227
I MET HIM ON THE SUBWAY.

1145
01:07:28,227 --> 01:07:32,398
HE'S A VAMPIRE.

1146
01:07:38,946 --> 01:07:40,365
YOU WERE WITH SOME WEIRDO

1147
01:07:40,365 --> 01:07:41,866
ALL NIGHT?

1148
01:07:41,866 --> 01:07:44,452
D-DID HE...?

1149
01:07:44,452 --> 01:07:46,537
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HAND?

1150
01:07:46,537 --> 01:07:48,456
NOTHING. IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1151
01:07:48,456 --> 01:07:49,540
I CAN'T BELIEVE

1152
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:51,125
HE WOULD DO THIS.

1153
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:52,210
I SHOULDN'T HAVE

1154
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:54,504
TO ASK PERMISSION TO LIVE.

1155
01:07:54,504 --> 01:07:55,546
I SHOULD BE ABLE

1156
01:07:55,546 --> 01:07:58,383
TO FOLLOW MY OWN BLOOD.

1157
01:07:58,383 --> 01:08:00,718
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1158
01:08:00,718 --> 01:08:01,761
YOU STAY AWAY FROM HIM,

1159
01:08:01,761 --> 01:08:02,845
YOU HEAR ME?

1160
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:03,888
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT?

1161
01:08:03,888 --> 01:08:04,972
OH, REALLY?   YES.

1162
01:08:04,972 --> 01:08:06,057
WHO LETS HIM WATCH

1163
01:08:06,057 --> 01:08:07,225
THOSE HORROR MOVIES?

1164
01:08:07,225 --> 01:08:08,309
NO, WHO INSISTS ON LIVING

1165
01:08:08,309 --> 01:08:09,394
IN THE MIDDLE OF CRIMINALS

1166
01:08:09,394 --> 01:08:10,561
AND FREAKS AND...!

1167
01:08:10,561 --> 01:08:11,604
STOP IT!

1168
01:08:11,604 --> 01:08:12,688
VALENTINE IS NOT A FREAK,

1169
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:14,732
HE'S MY FRIEND!

1170
01:08:14,732 --> 01:08:15,775
HE SAID THE MOST IMPORTANT

1171
01:08:15,775 --> 01:08:16,859
THING IN LIFE IS

1172
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:17,902
TO TRUST NO ONE.

1173
01:08:17,902 --> 01:08:20,405
( scoffs ) HE WAS RIGHT.

1174
01:08:20,405 --> 01:08:24,826
( Zach walks away )

1175
01:08:29,247 --> 01:08:32,917
ZACH.

1176
01:08:32,917 --> 01:08:34,585
ZACH, I-I-I'M SORRY

1177
01:08:34,585 --> 01:08:36,087
I LOST MY TEMPER.

1178
01:08:36,087 --> 01:08:37,922
IT'S JUST THAT, YOU KNOW,

1179
01:08:37,922 --> 01:08:40,925
I WAS... WE...

1180
01:08:40,925 --> 01:08:42,427
WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

1181
01:08:42,427 --> 01:08:43,511
IT'S DANGEROUS OUT THERE.

1182
01:08:43,511 --> 01:08:45,263
YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THAT.

1183
01:08:45,263 --> 01:08:47,181
I KNOW. THERE'S VAMPIRES.

1184
01:08:47,181 --> 01:08:48,266
THERE'S THINGS A LOT WORSE

1185
01:08:48,266 --> 01:08:50,309
THAN VAMPIRES, ZACH.

1186
01:08:50,309 --> 01:08:51,394
WE JUST DON'T WANT

1187
01:08:51,394 --> 01:08:53,604
ANYONE TO HURT YOU.

1188
01:08:53,604 --> 01:08:54,647
AND REMEMBER THAT

1189
01:08:54,647 --> 01:08:59,444
WE BOTH LOVE YOU.

1190
01:09:01,779 --> 01:09:02,905
MOM.

1191
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:04,449
HMM?

1192
01:09:04,449 --> 01:09:06,075
WHY'D YOU COME OVER HERE?

1193
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:07,952
WELL, BECAUSE DAD CALLED

1194
01:09:07,952 --> 01:09:09,454
AND SAID YOU WERE MISSING.

1195
01:09:09,454 --> 01:09:11,956
OH.

1196
01:09:11,956 --> 01:09:15,710
I THOUGHT YOU TWO WERE...

1197
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:19,297
YOU KNOW...

1198
01:09:19,297 --> 01:09:21,466
UM... YOU'D BETTER

1199
01:09:21,466 --> 01:09:27,680
GET SOME SLEEP, OKAY, HONEY?

1200
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:30,683
'NIGHT, SPORT.

1201
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:48,201
( excited chatter )

1202
01:09:52,371 --> 01:09:58,669
( panicked breathing )

1203
01:10:03,841 --> 01:10:07,178
WHAT ARE THESE?

1204
01:10:07,178 --> 01:10:10,097
NOTHING!

1205
01:10:10,097 --> 01:10:11,182
ARE THOSE THE PICTURES

1206
01:10:11,182 --> 01:10:12,225
YOU TOOK? NOTHING CAME OUT.

1207
01:10:12,225 --> 01:10:13,351
NO, THESE ARE THE PICTURES

1208
01:10:13,351 --> 01:10:14,936
I TOOK. THESE ARE

1209
01:10:14,936 --> 01:10:16,521
SOMETHING ELSE.

1210
01:10:16,521 --> 01:10:17,730
I'M KIND OF BUSY RIGHT NOW,

1211
01:10:17,730 --> 01:10:18,814
ALL RIGHT?

1212
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:21,359
YEAH. OKAY. SURE.

1213
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:23,236
I'LL CATCH YOU LATER.

1214
01:10:23,236 --> 01:10:27,406
( scoffs ) WHATEVER.

1215
01:10:27,406 --> 01:10:29,867
( background chatter )

1216
01:10:29,867 --> 01:10:30,910
ALL RIGHT, SETTLE DOWN,

1217
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:34,121
CLASS.

1218
01:10:34,121 --> 01:10:35,206
EXCELLENT WORK, GABRIELLE.

1219
01:10:35,206 --> 01:10:36,249
I'M QUITE IMPRESSED.

1220
01:10:36,249 --> 01:10:37,333
THANKS.

1221
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:38,376
YOU MUST HAVE SPENT HOURS

1222
01:10:38,376 --> 01:10:39,460
IN RESEARCH.

1223
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:41,379
WELL, YEAH.

1224
01:10:41,379 --> 01:10:42,421
GREAT, THANK YOU.

1225
01:10:42,421 --> 01:10:44,882
THANK YOU.

1226
01:10:44,882 --> 01:10:45,925
LET'S HELP YOU OUT HERE.

1227
01:10:45,925 --> 01:10:47,009
OH, THANKS.

1228
01:10:47,009 --> 01:10:48,052
ALL RIGHT, WHO CAN WE

1229
01:10:48,052 --> 01:10:54,600
HEAR FROM?

1230
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,645
ZACH KINCAID.

1231
01:10:57,645 --> 01:10:59,897
UH, MS. POTASHER,

1232
01:10:59,897 --> 01:11:02,108
I'M REALLY NOT READY YET.

1233
01:11:02,108 --> 01:11:03,192
YOU'VE KNOWN ABOUT THIS

1234
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:04,235
FOR WEEKS, ZACH.

1235
01:11:04,235 --> 01:11:05,736
I-I KNOW. I JUST NEED

1236
01:11:05,736 --> 01:11:07,113
ONE MORE DAY.

1237
01:11:07,113 --> 01:11:09,574
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

1238
01:11:09,574 --> 01:11:11,867
YOU CAN WORK ON IT AFTER CLASS,

1239
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:13,411
IN DETENTION.

1240
01:11:13,411 --> 01:11:16,831
YES, MS. POTASHER.

1241
01:11:16,831 --> 01:11:17,915
VERY WELL.

1242
01:11:17,915 --> 01:11:21,919
ELLISON, IS YOUR PROJECT READY?

1243
01:11:40,271 --> 01:11:43,107
Zach!

1244
01:11:43,107 --> 01:11:44,692
Zach!

1245
01:11:44,692 --> 01:11:45,776
What?

1246
01:11:45,776 --> 01:11:46,819
I just wanted to tell you

1247
01:11:46,819 --> 01:11:49,322
not to worry.

1248
01:11:49,322 --> 01:11:50,865
Worry about what?

1249
01:11:50,865 --> 01:11:51,949
I told Gabe

1250
01:11:51,949 --> 01:11:53,200
about your pictures.

1251
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:58,956
WHAT?! ( coughing )

1252
01:11:58,956 --> 01:12:02,084
I'm okay.

1253
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:03,586
Nice save.

1254
01:12:03,586 --> 01:12:05,004
Did she laugh?

1255
01:12:05,004 --> 01:12:06,881
Laugh? No.

1256
01:12:06,881 --> 01:12:08,716
She said she wanted to help.

1257
01:12:08,716 --> 01:12:11,844
Help? Help how?

1258
01:12:11,844 --> 01:12:13,804
She went down to the old

1259
01:12:13,804 --> 01:12:14,847
City Hall station,

1260
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:15,973
to take new pictures for you.

1261
01:12:15,973 --> 01:12:19,226
WHAT?! BUT SHE CAN'T!

1262
01:12:27,985 --> 01:12:29,028
I'M GONNA THROW UP!

1263
01:12:29,028 --> 01:12:30,571
TUNA BURRITO FOR LUNCH!

1264
01:12:30,571 --> 01:12:34,200
TOO MUCH!

1265
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,994
( mouthing silently )

1266
01:12:40,247 --> 01:12:41,874
I THOUGHT YOU WERE

1267
01:12:41,874 --> 01:12:42,959
IN DETENTION!

1268
01:12:42,959 --> 01:12:44,001
GABE WENT UNDERGROUND

1269
01:12:44,001 --> 01:12:45,086
TO THE OLD STATION?

1270
01:12:45,086 --> 01:12:46,462
SHE SAID YOU NEEDED PICTURES.

1271
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:47,505
BUT THERE'S VAMPIRES

1272
01:12:47,505 --> 01:12:48,589
DOWN THERE!

1273
01:12:48,589 --> 01:12:50,299
ZACH, IS THIS A LIE?

1274
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:51,342
J.T., I'VE KNOWN YOU

1275
01:12:51,342 --> 01:12:52,426
MY ENTIRE LIFE,

1276
01:12:52,426 --> 01:12:53,511
AND MAYBE I'VE LIED TO YOU

1277
01:12:53,511 --> 01:12:54,553
MY ENTIRE LIFE,

1278
01:12:54,553 --> 01:12:56,180
BUT THIS TIME, THIS ONE TIME,

1279
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:57,848
I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

1280
01:12:57,848 --> 01:12:59,517
OKAY. THERE ARE VAMPIRES

1281
01:12:59,517 --> 01:13:01,602
IN THE SUBWAY.

1282
01:13:01,602 --> 01:13:02,687
YEAH. WELL... I'VE GOT

1283
01:13:02,687 --> 01:13:03,729
TO GO DOWN THERE AND GET HER.

1284
01:13:03,729 --> 01:13:07,024
JUST COVER FOR ME, ALL RIGHT?

1285
01:13:07,024 --> 01:13:08,192
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1286
01:13:08,192 --> 01:13:10,027
GABE'S DOWN THERE!

1287
01:13:10,027 --> 01:13:11,070
YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME.

1288
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:12,279
IT'S MY FAULT SHE'S DOWN THERE.

1289
01:13:12,279 --> 01:13:14,532
WHAT ARE FRIENDS FOR?

1290
01:13:14,532 --> 01:13:15,866
IF THERE REALLY ARE VAMPIRES,

1291
01:13:15,866 --> 01:13:17,201
THAT EXPLAINS A LOT.

1292
01:13:17,201 --> 01:13:18,244
WHAT?

1293
01:13:18,244 --> 01:13:19,704
I CHECKED OUT THE 'NET.

1294
01:13:19,704 --> 01:13:20,788
PEOPLE ALL OVER HAVE SEEN 'EM

1295
01:13:20,788 --> 01:13:21,872
AND BELIEVE IN 'EM, SO,

1296
01:13:21,872 --> 01:13:22,957
YOU KNOW, MAYBE THERE'S SOME

1297
01:13:22,957 --> 01:13:24,041
TRUTH TO WHAT YOU SAY.

1298
01:13:24,041 --> 01:13:25,084
BUT, ANYWAY,

1299
01:13:25,084 --> 01:13:26,168
ON ONE OF THEIR PAGES,

1300
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:27,211
IT SAID IF A VAMPIRE TASTES

1301
01:13:27,211 --> 01:13:28,295
YOUR BLOOD, THEY'RE, LIKE,

1302
01:13:28,295 --> 01:13:29,380
IN YOU,

1303
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:30,423
AND YOU DO VAMPIRE THINGS

1304
01:13:30,423 --> 01:13:31,882
AND WANT VAMPIRE THINGS.

1305
01:13:31,882 --> 01:13:33,092
AND YOU KNOW YOU SAID--

1306
01:13:33,092 --> 01:13:34,176
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

1307
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:35,219
BUT WHAT DID IT SAY ABOUT LIGHT?

1308
01:13:35,219 --> 01:13:36,303
DID IT SAY ANYTHING

1309
01:13:36,303 --> 01:13:37,388
ABOUT WHY IT BURNS 'EM?

1310
01:13:37,388 --> 01:13:38,431
IT'S THE ULTRAVIOLET,

1311
01:13:38,431 --> 01:13:39,515
THE U.V.

1312
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:41,434
IT'S LIKE A TANNING BOOTH.

1313
01:13:41,434 --> 01:13:42,518
ALL FLUORESCENTS

1314
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:44,311
HAVE A LOT OF IT, AND SUNLIGHT.

1315
01:13:44,311 --> 01:13:45,396
BUT NOT REGULAR LIGHT BULBS?

1316
01:13:45,396 --> 01:13:48,232
NOPE. DON'T HURT 'EM.

1317
01:13:48,232 --> 01:13:49,734
LET'S GO.

1318
01:13:53,112 --> 01:13:55,281
YOU SEE ANYTHING?

1319
01:13:55,281 --> 01:13:57,408
NAH. YOU?

1320
01:13:57,408 --> 01:13:58,743
NAH.

1321
01:13:58,743 --> 01:14:00,536
REMEMBER,

1322
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:01,537
VALENTINE WILL PROTECT US,

1323
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:03,247
BUT THE OTHERS...

1324
01:14:03,247 --> 01:14:05,082
WE SEE THE OTHERS, WE RUN,

1325
01:14:05,082 --> 01:14:06,250
RIGHT?

1326
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:09,587
RIGHT.

1327
01:14:09,587 --> 01:14:11,589
WHAT?

1328
01:14:11,589 --> 01:14:13,758
I THOUGHT I HEARD SOMETHING.

1329
01:14:13,758 --> 01:14:15,593
IT'S PROBABLY A RAT.

1330
01:14:15,593 --> 01:14:17,428
ARE THERE LITTLE MIDGET

1331
01:14:17,428 --> 01:14:19,263
VAMPIRES?

1332
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:20,306
OR...

1333
01:14:20,306 --> 01:14:22,767
THIS IS JUST A THOUGHT, BUT DO

1334
01:14:22,767 --> 01:14:26,103
BATS BECOME VAMPIRES?

1335
01:14:26,103 --> 01:14:27,146
NAH. I MEAN,

1336
01:14:27,146 --> 01:14:29,607
I DON'T THINK SO. MAYBE.

1337
01:14:29,607 --> 01:14:32,610
LET'S GO.

1338
01:14:39,658 --> 01:14:40,743
SHH!

1339
01:14:40,743 --> 01:14:42,953
WHAT?

1340
01:14:42,953 --> 01:14:46,040
OVER THERE.

1341
01:14:49,794 --> 01:14:52,922
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

1342
01:14:52,922 --> 01:14:56,467
I DON'T, EITHER.

1343
01:14:56,467 --> 01:14:59,136
WHAT DO WE DO?

1344
01:14:59,136 --> 01:15:02,640
GO ON, I GUESS.

1345
01:15:07,895 --> 01:15:09,688
HARV.

1346
01:15:09,688 --> 01:15:12,983
HOWDY, ZACH.

1347
01:15:12,983 --> 01:15:14,568
J.T.

1348
01:15:14,568 --> 01:15:15,778
WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN HERE?

1349
01:15:15,778 --> 01:15:16,821
I MEAN, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

1350
01:15:16,821 --> 01:15:17,905
MR. CHAN'S BEEN WORRIED

1351
01:15:17,905 --> 01:15:18,906
ABOUT YOU.

1352
01:15:18,906 --> 01:15:22,493
JUST TAKING A BREAK.

1353
01:15:22,493 --> 01:15:23,536
EVEN GUYS LIKE ME

1354
01:15:23,536 --> 01:15:27,665
NEED A VACATION SOMETIMES.

1355
01:15:27,665 --> 01:15:29,250
UH... DID YOU SEE GABE

1356
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:30,835
COME DOWN HERE?

1357
01:15:30,835 --> 01:15:33,504
GABE?

1358
01:15:33,504 --> 01:15:34,839
YEAH.

1359
01:15:34,839 --> 01:15:35,840
GREAT. WELL, WHEN DID

1360
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:36,841
SHE COME THROUGH?

1361
01:15:36,841 --> 01:15:37,883
WHERE DID SHE GO?

1362
01:15:37,883 --> 01:15:40,302
SHE'S WITH VALENTINE.

1363
01:15:40,302 --> 01:15:42,972
GOOD. HE'LL PROTECT HER.

1364
01:15:42,972 --> 01:15:44,723
VALENTINE?

1365
01:15:44,723 --> 01:15:45,808
YEAH.

1366
01:15:45,808 --> 01:15:47,476
HE DOESN'T LIKE HUMAN BLOOD.

1367
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:50,938
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

1368
01:15:50,938 --> 01:15:52,773
HE DID.

1369
01:15:52,773 --> 01:15:54,900
AND YOU BELIEVED HIM?

1370
01:15:54,900 --> 01:16:00,072
( laughing )

1371
01:16:13,043 --> 01:16:15,212
HARV, IS THERE SOMETHING

1372
01:16:15,212 --> 01:16:20,384
THAT YOU'RE NOT TELLING US?

1373
01:16:20,384 --> 01:16:23,137
COULD BE.

1374
01:16:23,137 --> 01:16:24,221
WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT IT

1375
01:16:24,221 --> 01:16:28,475
OVER LUNCH?

1376
01:16:30,019 --> 01:16:31,228
JOIN ME FOR A BITE?

1377
01:16:31,228 --> 01:16:33,188
RUN, ZACH!

1378
01:16:33,188 --> 01:16:35,983
( Harv growling )

1379
01:16:41,655 --> 01:16:46,827
AHH! AHH! ZACH!

1380
01:16:46,827 --> 01:16:49,455
OH, NO!

1381
01:16:49,455 --> 01:16:50,831
GOTCHA!

1382
01:16:50,831 --> 01:16:52,333
I'M YOUR FRIEND!

1383
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:54,585
ZACH, YOU'RE MY LUNCH!

1384
01:16:59,465 --> 01:17:01,800
AAAHHHH!

1385
01:17:17,858 --> 01:17:18,943
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS

1386
01:17:18,943 --> 01:17:19,985
IS HAPPENING.

1387
01:17:19,985 --> 01:17:21,070
THAT WAS CLOSE!

1388
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:22,112
I DON'T NEVER WANT THAT

1389
01:17:22,112 --> 01:17:24,615
TO HAPPEN AGAIN.

1390
01:17:24,615 --> 01:17:25,658
IT'S ALL MY FAULT

1391
01:17:25,658 --> 01:17:26,742
SHE'S DOWN THERE.

1392
01:17:26,742 --> 01:17:28,077
IF I WASN'T SO MEAN TO HER,

1393
01:17:28,077 --> 01:17:29,119
SHE WOULD HAVE NEVER

1394
01:17:29,119 --> 01:17:30,245
TOOK THOSE PICTURES.

1395
01:17:30,245 --> 01:17:31,288
AND IF WE DIDN'T CARE, WE

1396
01:17:31,288 --> 01:17:32,498
WOULDN'T BE TRYING TO SAVE HER,

1397
01:17:32,498 --> 01:17:34,083
BUT SHE DID, AND WE DO,

1398
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:36,961
AND WE WILL.

1399
01:17:36,961 --> 01:17:38,128
SO, WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

1400
01:17:38,128 --> 01:17:39,171
JUST GO BACK DOWN THERE,

1401
01:17:39,171 --> 01:17:40,255
WALKING UP AND DOWN

1402
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:41,298
THE TUNNELS?

1403
01:17:41,298 --> 01:17:43,968
NO. VALENTINE'S GOT HER,

1404
01:17:43,968 --> 01:17:45,928
AND I THINK I KNOW WHERE.

1405
01:17:45,928 --> 01:17:49,139
CAN WE GET THERE BY SUNLIGHT?

1406
01:17:49,139 --> 01:17:50,557
I ONLY KNOW ONE WAY.

1407
01:18:08,617 --> 01:18:10,953
ZACH?

1408
01:18:10,953 --> 01:18:12,496
WHAT?

1409
01:18:12,496 --> 01:18:14,832
HOW LONG WE BEEN DOWN HERE?

1410
01:18:14,832 --> 01:18:17,001
I-I DON'T KNOW. A LONG TIME.

1411
01:18:17,001 --> 01:18:18,669
LIKE, A COUPLE OF HOURS?

1412
01:18:18,669 --> 01:18:21,839
AT LEAST A COUPLE OF HOURS.

1413
01:18:21,839 --> 01:18:23,173
YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING?

1414
01:18:23,173 --> 01:18:25,175
YEAH.

1415
01:18:25,175 --> 01:18:26,260
YOU SURE YOU KNOW

1416
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:27,344
WHERE WE'RE GOING?

1417
01:18:27,344 --> 01:18:28,846
ABSOLUTELY.

1418
01:18:28,846 --> 01:18:32,016
OKAY, ZACH.

1419
01:18:32,016 --> 01:18:33,350
WHAT?

1420
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:34,393
YOU'RE NOT LYING AGAIN,

1421
01:18:34,393 --> 01:18:37,021
ARE YOU? I MEAN,

1422
01:18:37,021 --> 01:18:38,230
I CAN UNDERSTAND IF YOU--

1423
01:18:38,230 --> 01:18:39,857
YES! I'M LYING, ALL RIGHT?

1424
01:18:39,857 --> 01:18:41,025
WE'RE LOST. I DON'T KNOW WHERE

1425
01:18:41,025 --> 01:18:42,234
WE'RE GOING. WE'RE GONNA WANDER

1426
01:18:42,234 --> 01:18:43,485
AROUND DOWN HERE UNTIL WE STARVE

1427
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:44,570
TO DEATH OR THE RATS EAT US, OR

1428
01:18:44,570 --> 01:18:45,738
UNTIL HARV OR SIMS OR ONE OF THE

1429
01:18:45,738 --> 01:18:46,822
OTHER VAMPIRES FINDS US AND

1430
01:18:46,822 --> 01:18:48,032
FANGS US, AND WE JOIN THE UNDEAD

1431
01:18:48,032 --> 01:18:50,534
FOREVER! YOU HAPPY NOW?!

1432
01:18:50,534 --> 01:18:51,577
AS LONG AS YOU KNOW

1433
01:18:51,577 --> 01:18:52,870
WHERE WE'RE GOING.

1434
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:55,914
( Zach scoffs )

1435
01:19:00,044 --> 01:19:04,131
LOOK!

1436
01:19:58,936 --> 01:20:00,521
THERE SHE IS.

1437
01:20:00,521 --> 01:20:03,607
ZACH!

1438
01:20:03,607 --> 01:20:08,028
MMM. ZACHARY

1439
01:20:08,028 --> 01:20:11,281
AND HIS LITTLE FRIEND.

1440
01:20:11,281 --> 01:20:13,033
WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU.

1441
01:20:13,033 --> 01:20:14,118
LET HER GO, VALENTINE.

1442
01:20:14,118 --> 01:20:15,160
TAKE ME INSTEAD.

1443
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:16,245
WE DON'T BARGAIN

1444
01:20:16,245 --> 01:20:17,704
WITH THE LIVING.

1445
01:20:17,704 --> 01:20:18,789
WHY SHOULD WE LET

1446
01:20:18,789 --> 01:20:19,832
ANY OF YOU GO?

1447
01:20:19,832 --> 01:20:21,625
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?

1448
01:20:21,625 --> 01:20:22,668
YOU TOLD ME YOU DIDN'T DRINK

1449
01:20:22,668 --> 01:20:26,004
HUMAN BLOOD.

1450
01:20:26,004 --> 01:20:27,881
I LIED.

1451
01:20:27,881 --> 01:20:31,552
( laughter )

1452
01:20:31,552 --> 01:20:34,763
ZACHARY, I'M A VAMPIRE.

1453
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:35,806
DRINKING HUMAN BLOOD

1454
01:20:35,806 --> 01:20:39,143
IS MY NATURE.

1455
01:20:39,143 --> 01:20:40,227
I WARNED YOU.

1456
01:20:40,227 --> 01:20:42,980
I TOLD YOU:

1457
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:44,523
TRUST NO ONE.

1458
01:20:44,523 --> 01:20:46,275
I EVEN GAVE YOU A CLUE.

1459
01:20:46,275 --> 01:20:47,818
WHAT CLUE?

1460
01:20:47,818 --> 01:20:48,902
WELL, I STARTED

1461
01:20:48,902 --> 01:20:51,488
THIS LITTLE FAMILY.

1462
01:20:51,488 --> 01:20:52,531
NOW, HOW COULD I DO THAT

1463
01:20:52,531 --> 01:20:54,825
WITHOUT DRINKING HUMAN BLOOD?

1464
01:20:54,825 --> 01:20:56,326
( sighs ) HE'S RIGHT.

1465
01:20:56,326 --> 01:20:58,245
I'M SO STUPID.

1466
01:20:58,245 --> 01:20:59,329
NO, YOU JUST HEARD

1467
01:20:59,329 --> 01:21:01,999
WHAT YOU WANTED TO HEAR.

1468
01:21:01,999 --> 01:21:04,668
SHE IS SO... SWEET.

1469
01:21:04,668 --> 01:21:06,336
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT A MINUTE,

1470
01:21:06,336 --> 01:21:10,883
MAN. WE WERE GONNA SHARE HER.

1471
01:21:10,883 --> 01:21:12,634
THIS IS A COMMUNAL THING,

1472
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:13,677
ISN'T IT?

1473
01:21:13,677 --> 01:21:17,055
BUT NOW THERE ARE TWO MORE.

1474
01:21:17,055 --> 01:21:18,557
SIMS.

1475
01:21:18,557 --> 01:21:20,893
WELL, YOU COULD JUST...

1476
01:21:20,893 --> 01:21:21,977
YOU KNOW... DO WHAT YOU

1477
01:21:21,977 --> 01:21:24,021
WERE DOING, AND WE'LL

1478
01:21:24,021 --> 01:21:25,939
TAKE GABE AND GO.

1479
01:21:25,939 --> 01:21:27,441
YES, WE COULD DO THAT,

1480
01:21:27,441 --> 01:21:28,901
BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO.

1481
01:21:28,901 --> 01:21:29,985
( laughter )

1482
01:21:29,985 --> 01:21:35,032
SHE IS SO SWEET,

1483
01:21:35,032 --> 01:21:38,035
JUST LIKE A ROSE IN BLOOM.

1484
01:21:38,035 --> 01:21:39,077
CAN THE POETRY,

1485
01:21:39,077 --> 01:21:41,914
COUNT CHOCULA.

1486
01:21:41,914 --> 01:21:42,998
SHE DOES LACK MANNERS,

1487
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:44,041
THOUGH, DOESN'T SHE?

1488
01:21:44,041 --> 01:21:45,125
LET HER GO.

1489
01:21:45,125 --> 01:21:46,210
I MEAN IT, VALENTINE.

1490
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:51,048
OHH! LET HER GO, LET HER GO.

1491
01:21:51,048 --> 01:21:53,550
NO, I THINK NOT. NO.

1492
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:55,385
WELL, UNLESS...

1493
01:21:55,385 --> 01:21:57,846
WHAT? WHAT DO YOU WANT?

1494
01:21:57,846 --> 01:21:59,223
WE'D BE VERY GRATEFUL

1495
01:21:59,223 --> 01:22:00,265
IF YOU COULD DO ONE

1496
01:22:00,265 --> 01:22:02,935
TINY LITTLE THING FOR US.

1497
01:22:02,935 --> 01:22:04,019
THAT IS, TO THROW

1498
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:06,521
ONE LITTLE SWITCH,

1499
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:09,066
ONE TINY SWITCH

1500
01:22:09,066 --> 01:22:10,108
THAT WILL CONNECT

1501
01:22:10,108 --> 01:22:12,236
THE UNDEAD EXPRESS

1502
01:22:12,236 --> 01:22:15,530
TO THE REGULAR SUBWAY LINES.

1503
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:17,574
WHAT?

1504
01:22:17,574 --> 01:22:20,744
BUT IF I DID THAT, YOU COULD--

1505
01:22:20,744 --> 01:22:21,787
YOU'D BE ABLE TO ATTACK

1506
01:22:21,787 --> 01:22:24,289
NEW YORK.

1507
01:22:24,289 --> 01:22:25,374

1511
01:22:31,588 --> 01:22:34,925
YOU HELP US, AND WE HELP YOU.

1512
01:22:34,925 --> 01:22:37,386
WE'D BE... SO GRATEFUL FOR IT.

1513
01:22:37,386 --> 01:22:39,054
I CAN'T DO THAT!

1515
01:22:40,097 --> 01:22:42,683

1516
01:22:42,683 --> 01:22:43,767
WHY NOT?

1517
01:22:43,767 --> 01:22:44,810
THEY'D PROBABLY BE

1518
01:22:44,810 --> 01:22:45,894
A LOT SAFER THAN

1519
01:22:45,894 --> 01:22:48,063

1520
01:22:48,063 --> 01:22:50,774

1521
01:22:50,774 --> 01:22:51,817
IT'S A VERY SIMPLE THING,

1522
01:22:51,817 --> 01:22:53,485
REALLY.

1523
01:22:53,485 --> 01:22:54,570
EITHER YOU DO THIS

1524
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:57,281
LITTLE FAVOR FOR US,

1525
01:22:57,281 --> 01:22:59,449

1526

1527
01:23:02,619 --> 01:23:05,622
RIGHT NOW.

1528
01:23:05,622 --> 01:23:07,082
Don't do it.

1529
01:23:07,082 --> 01:23:08,125
OH, THAT'S BAD ADVICE.

1530
01:23:08,125 --> 01:23:09,209
I CAN'T LET 'EM DO IT.

1531
01:23:09,209 --> 01:23:10,294

1532

1543
01:23:32,566 --> 01:23:36,820

1544

1545

1546
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:46,663

1547
01:23:50,542 --> 01:23:51,626

1548
01:23:51,626 --> 01:23:52,669
I'VE BEEN WAITING

1549
01:23:52,669 --> 01:23:53,962
60 YEARS FOR THIS.

1550
01:23:53,962 --> 01:23:55,797
HARV WAS ONLY AN APPETIZER.

1551
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:57,174
SINCE YOU BROUGHT HIM UP,

1552
01:23:57,174 --> 01:23:58,342
YOU MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN SOMEONE

1553
01:23:58,342 --> 01:24:00,177
WITH MORE BREEDING.

1554
01:24:00,177 --> 01:24:01,219
THIS IS AS FAR AS

1555
01:24:01,219 --> 01:24:04,890
WE VAMPIRES CAN GO, ZACHARY.

1556
01:24:04,890 --> 01:24:06,016
I CAN GO BACK TO WALL STREET

1557
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:07,976
EARLY. START TRADING.

1558
01:24:07,976 --> 01:24:09,394
BITE A BROKER.

1559
01:24:09,394 --> 01:24:10,479
FEED AND GROW RICH

1560
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:13,649
AT THE SAME TIME! HEH HEH HEH!

1561
01:24:13,649 --> 01:24:14,691
AND I COULD GO BACK

1562
01:24:14,691 --> 01:24:15,776
TO THE FALLS.

1563
01:24:15,776 --> 01:24:17,027
THEY REALLY ARE GORGEOUS,

1564
01:24:17,027 --> 01:24:19,196
AND THE TOURISTS...

1565
01:24:19,196 --> 01:24:20,238
HAVE SUCH GOOD TASTE!

1567
01:24:25,702 --> 01:24:27,996
JUST AHEAD, ROUND THE CORNER,

1568
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:30,207
THERE'S A SWITCH.

1569
01:24:30,207 --> 01:24:32,292
IF YOU THROW IT,

1570
01:24:32,292 --> 01:24:33,919
WE CAN ROUTE THE UNDEAD EXPRESS

1571
01:24:33,919 --> 01:24:36,671
TO ANY OF THE REGULAR LINES.

1572
01:24:36,671 --> 01:24:38,757
AND THEN YOU START...

1573
01:24:38,757 --> 01:24:39,925

1574
01:24:39,925 --> 01:24:41,885

WE CAN'T REACH THE SWITCH.

1584
