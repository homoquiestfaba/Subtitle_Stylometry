[soft piano music]

3
00:01:27,862 --> 00:01:29,413
- Find out from Wendell
what's holding up

4
00:01:29,413 --> 00:01:33,620
the Nettleston contract,
I thought we had a deal.

[dramatic piano music]

6
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,275
Good morning.

7
00:01:51,275 --> 00:01:52,517
- You're early.

8
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:56,103
- Somebody told me there
are 25 hours in a day,

9
00:01:56,103 --> 00:01:57,896
if you can figure it out.

10
00:01:57,896 --> 00:01:59,000
How are you feeling?

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
- Like a whale.

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,310
- Yeah, I remember, vaguely.

14
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:15,517
I'll get back to you
 tomorrow Richard,

15
00:02:15,517 --> 00:02:16,896
but I really don't
 think sleeping on it

16
00:02:16,896 --> 00:02:18,931
is gonna turn the tide here.

17
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:21,586
No, I can't live
 with that number.

18
00:02:21,586 --> 00:02:22,862
Yes.

19
00:02:22,862 --> 00:02:23,689
Ciao.

[dial tone]

21
00:02:39,448 --> 00:02:41,068
- [Voice On Machine] Hi, you've
reached James and Donald.

22
00:02:41,068 --> 00:02:42,862
You can leave a message
for either one of us.

23
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:44,724
We have no secrets
 from each other,

24
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:46,275
well, one or two maybe.

25
00:02:46,275 --> 00:02:47,310
Here comes the beep.

26
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,241
[beeping]

27
00:02:49,241 --> 00:02:51,000
- James, it's me.

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,517
Do you recognize my voice?

29
00:02:52,517 --> 00:02:53,551
Does it ring a bell?

30
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:54,827
It should hon.

31
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:56,068
This is the third
 time you've heard it

32
00:02:56,068 --> 00:02:58,034
in the past two weeks.

33
00:02:58,034 --> 00:03:00,068
The problem is I
 haven't heard yours.

34
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:01,103
What's going on?

35
00:03:01,103 --> 00:03:02,310
You know how bonkers it makes me

36
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,379
when my calls aren't returned.

37
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:05,482
I hope you're not
 still ticked off

38
00:03:05,482 --> 00:03:07,724
about that ridiculous quarrel.

39
00:03:07,724 --> 00:03:09,965
I don't even remember
 what it was about.

40
00:03:09,965 --> 00:03:11,517
Bygones here, okay?

41
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:13,620
If you don't return this call,

42
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,310
I'm probably gonna
 start worrying.

43
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,379
Have a heart.

44
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:22,586
It's Monday the
 23rd, and counting.

47
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:12,862
- Toto, I have a feeling
 we're not in Kansas anymore.

48
00:04:35,137 --> 00:04:36,620
- [Woman] Hello?

49
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,448
- It's me.

50
00:04:38,517 --> 00:04:39,862
- Well, at last.

51
00:04:41,965 --> 00:04:44,586
What is it, are you still
 made at me, or what?

52
00:04:44,586 --> 00:04:45,896
- Can we get together?

53
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:46,862
- [Mother] Are you still mad?

54
00:04:46,862 --> 00:04:47,793
You sound mad.

55
00:04:47,793 --> 00:04:49,034
- No mother, I'm not mad.

56
00:04:49,034 --> 00:04:51,448
I don't remember what
 it was about, either.

57
00:04:51,448 --> 00:04:53,482
- Good, I forgive you for all
 the rotten things you said,

58
00:04:53,482 --> 00:04:55,275
whatever they were.

59
00:04:55,275 --> 00:04:57,000
- Can we get together?

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,379
- [Mother] Say when, lunch?

61
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:00,000
- How about now?

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,586
- Now? You mean tonight?

63
00:05:01,586 --> 00:05:02,517
- Yes.

64
00:05:02,517 --> 00:05:03,862
- It's pretty late.

65
00:05:03,862 --> 00:05:05,551
- Yeah, I know what
 time it is, mother.

66
00:05:05,551 --> 00:05:06,551
- James, you don't sound good.

67
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:08,034
Are you all right?

68
00:05:09,344 --> 00:05:12,000
- Would it be all
 right if I came by?

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,103
- Absolutely.

70
00:05:18,793 --> 00:05:21,413
- Sorry about the hour.

71
00:05:21,413 --> 00:05:22,862
- Don't be silly.

72
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,206
Should I ask, or should I wait?

73
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,551
- Donald has AIDS.

74
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:38,758
He's gonna die soon,

75
00:05:38,758 --> 00:05:39,689
so it would mean
 a great deal to me

76
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:41,896
if you don't get hysterical.

77
00:05:44,586 --> 00:05:47,172
- How long have you known?

78
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:50,758
- He tested positive
 two years ago.

79
00:05:50,758 --> 00:05:53,862
- And you're telling me now?

80
00:05:53,862 --> 00:05:56,137
- I had to hospitalize
 him this morning.

81
00:05:56,137 --> 00:05:58,275
The KS has become very severe.

82
00:05:58,275 --> 00:05:59,482
- The what?

83
00:05:59,482 --> 00:06:03,482
- Kaposi sarcoma,
 it's a kind of cancer.

84
00:06:03,482 --> 00:06:06,724
He wanted to be at
 home, but I couldn't.

85
00:06:06,724 --> 00:06:09,655
It'll be better for
 him in the hospital.

86
00:06:09,655 --> 00:06:11,448
- He hasn't even
 looked ill lately.

87
00:06:11,448 --> 00:06:12,275
I mean--

88
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:13,482
- Lately?

89
00:06:13,482 --> 00:06:14,689
You haven't seen him
in at least six months,

90
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:15,896
and maybe what,
 two or three times,

91
00:06:15,896 --> 00:06:18,551
in the year before
 that, at most?

92
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:26,000
It's gonna be very
 fast for him now.

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,517
A week, maybe two.

94
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:32,586
- Is it all right to visit him?

95
00:06:32,586 --> 00:06:33,827
- If you like.

96
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,275
- For God's sake,
 of course I'd like.

97
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:36,482
Why do you say
 something like that?

98
00:06:36,482 --> 00:06:37,413
That's terrible.

99
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:39,896
- Let's be friends, all right?

100
00:06:41,482 --> 00:06:44,034
It's a good time to be friends.

101
00:06:46,241 --> 00:06:48,034
- I didn't know what
 kind of flowers he likes.

102
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:49,310
I got roses.

103
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,379
Roses usually say,

104
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:52,448
and candy.

105
00:06:52,448 --> 00:06:54,000
Does he like candy?

106
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,448
- He has a tremendous
 sweet tooth,

107
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:59,931
I sometimes I have to be very
 stern with him about that.

108
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:05,034
- Well I haven't had to deal
 with this since your father.

109
00:07:05,034 --> 00:07:06,482
- Deal with what?

110
00:07:08,206 --> 00:07:09,034
With what?

111
00:07:10,103 --> 00:07:10,965
- Dying.

112
00:07:12,862 --> 00:07:14,482
- Donald and I have
 been to 14 funerals

113
00:07:14,482 --> 00:07:16,310
in the past 18 months.

114
00:07:21,931 --> 00:07:22,758
[phone ringing]

115
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:23,896
Look who's here.

116
00:07:23,896 --> 00:07:26,413
- Everybody comes to Rick.

117
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:27,413
- Hi Donald.

118
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:30,413
- The long one
 has to be flowers.

119
00:07:30,413 --> 00:07:31,758
- He's so quick.

120
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:36,137
- If this is candy
 it's our secret.

121
00:07:36,137 --> 00:07:39,241
- The secret is out, and
it's not on the menu.

122
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:43,068
- See, things are already
 taking an ugly turn.

123
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:51,655
I'm dying for a cigarette.

124
00:07:51,655 --> 00:07:52,724
- Have one.

125
00:07:52,724 --> 00:07:54,068
- [James] He gave it up.

126
00:07:54,068 --> 00:07:56,310
- Me too, three months ago.

127
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,827
- It's hell, isn't it?

128
00:07:57,827 --> 00:08:01,931
- Oh, I can't be held
 responsible for my actions.

129
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:05,310
- I gave up smoking
 for my health.

130
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,000
The insurance company
 should come up

131
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,793
with a whole new concept,

132
00:08:09,793 --> 00:08:11,103
irony insurance.

133
00:08:12,896 --> 00:08:16,206
I tell you there's a
 fortune to be made.

134
00:08:17,724 --> 00:08:19,724
Remember when we smoked?

135
00:08:23,724 --> 00:08:25,758
- Does he have any family?

136
00:08:25,758 --> 00:08:27,413
- His mother.

137
00:08:27,413 --> 00:08:30,551
His father's been lost
 in the mist of time.

138
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:33,103
- I assume that she
 knew before I did.

139
00:08:33,103 --> 00:08:34,344
- Knew what?

140
00:08:34,344 --> 00:08:37,103
- About Donald,
 what's happening.

141
00:08:37,103 --> 00:08:39,689
- Donald and his mother
 haven't spoken for years.

142
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:41,172
- Why not?

143
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:42,931
- Her response to his
 sexual orientation

144
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:44,827
was less than enlightened.

145
00:08:44,827 --> 00:08:46,896
- I gather you're
 understating it?

146
00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:48,172
- Considerably.

147
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:50,275
- Well, she should be told,

148
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:51,931
about Donald, what's happening.

149
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,275
- Mother try to stop
saying that, would you?

150
00:08:53,275 --> 00:08:54,689
About Donald, what's happening.

151
00:08:54,689 --> 00:08:56,448
Donald has AIDS, he's dying,

152
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:58,793
can we please stop
 tap dancing, finally?

153
00:08:58,793 --> 00:08:59,620
- What's going on?

154
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,758
Why are you so angry?

155
00:09:00,758 --> 00:09:02,482
What tap dancing?

156
00:09:02,482 --> 00:09:04,068
- Sorry.

157
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:05,344
I'm a little stressed.

158
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,137
I haven't slept in days.

159
00:09:07,137 --> 00:09:09,172
If I have a sudden compulsion
 to give up my tap shoes,

160
00:09:09,172 --> 00:09:10,827
I shouldn't hit you in the
 head with them, should I?

161
00:09:10,827 --> 00:09:12,344
- I'm not following this, James.

162
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,379
- You were wondering
 about his mother.

163
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:16,137
- I gather we're
 changing the subject,

164
00:09:16,137 --> 00:09:17,137
and not very subtly.

165
00:09:17,137 --> 00:09:19,241
- May we, please?

166
00:09:19,241 --> 00:09:20,793
- I think his
 mother should know.

167
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,827
Whether they're on speaking
 terms or not, he's her son.

168
00:09:23,827 --> 00:09:24,965
Where does she live?

169
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,689
- Arkansas.

170
00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:28,517
Donald was born there.

171
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,517
- Are you going to
 get in touch with her?

172
00:09:33,517 --> 00:09:34,724
- No.

173
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:35,655
- Well, what about Donald?

174
00:09:35,655 --> 00:09:36,793
Doesn't he want her to know?

175
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:38,034
- I'm not sure.

176
00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:39,724
- Well, ask him.

177
00:09:39,724 --> 00:09:40,551
- I did.

178
00:09:41,655 --> 00:09:43,517
We discussed it at length.

179
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:44,931
We even went so far
 as to locate her.

180
00:09:44,931 --> 00:09:46,068
She's in the book,

181
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:47,724
a place called, Fayetteville.

182
00:09:47,724 --> 00:09:48,551
- And?

183
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,965
- He'd rather not tell her,
 than risk her not caring.

184
00:10:01,172 --> 00:10:03,344
- Why didn't I know all that?

185
00:10:03,344 --> 00:10:04,724
- All what?

186
00:10:04,724 --> 00:10:07,482
- About Donald and his mother,

187
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,517
and where he's from and
 what happened between them,

188
00:10:09,517 --> 00:10:10,344
all that?

189
00:10:11,206 --> 00:10:13,827
- We know what we want to know.

190
00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:17,689
I'll be in touch.

191
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:33,103
[phone dialing]

192
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:37,137
- Oh, Audrey Grant, is he in?

193
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,137
- They're promising
 a 14% return.

194
00:10:40,137 --> 00:10:41,689
If you believe that,
 they'll tell us another one

195
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:43,206
just as hysterical.

196
00:10:44,586 --> 00:10:47,068
What we need.
 [buzzing]

197
00:10:47,068 --> 00:10:47,896
Hello?

198
00:10:49,896 --> 00:10:50,689
Oh.

199
00:10:53,137 --> 00:10:54,241
Hi.

200
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:56,448
- I need a friend.

201
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,034
- You need a husband.

202
00:10:58,034 --> 00:10:59,137
I'm still available,

203
00:10:59,137 --> 00:11:00,103
but it's only fair to tell you

204
00:11:00,103 --> 00:11:03,034
I'm considering other offers.

205
00:11:03,034 --> 00:11:04,551
- I need a friend.

206
00:11:06,172 --> 00:11:09,103
- Let's see if we
 can find you one.

207
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,275

[soft piano music]

210
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:39,068
- Then he drops this bit about
 we know what we want to know,

211
00:12:39,068 --> 00:12:41,172
and leaves me
 dangling with that.

212
00:12:41,172 --> 00:12:42,793
Well, what's that
 supposed to mean?

213
00:12:42,793 --> 00:12:44,517
I mean I know what
 it's supposed to mean,

214
00:12:44,517 --> 00:12:46,000
more or less but,

215
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,827
what does it have to do with me?

216
00:12:47,827 --> 00:12:50,068
- Why do you still have that?

217
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:53,758
Do you have a pack of butts
 tucked away in your bag, too?

218
00:12:53,758 --> 00:12:56,758
- James used to teeth on
that when he was a baby.

219
00:12:56,758 --> 00:12:58,413
See, there are his teeth marks.

220
00:12:58,413 --> 00:12:59,827
- If you don't mind I'm
 not gonna get sentimental

221
00:12:59,827 --> 00:13:02,965
about something that was
lighting the way to your grave.

[phone ringing]

224
00:13:17,758 --> 00:13:18,586
- Yeah?

225
00:13:19,689 --> 00:13:20,517
Hello?

226
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:23,896
When the heavy breathing
starts you're canceled,

227
00:13:23,896 --> 00:13:26,310
you got three seconds.

228
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,344
- Hello.

229
00:13:27,344 --> 00:13:29,482
Am I speaking to Missus Barnes?

230
00:13:29,482 --> 00:13:30,793
Luanne Barnes?

231
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:31,827
- That's who you're speaking to,

232
00:13:31,827 --> 00:13:33,551
who's speaking to me?

233
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:39,931
[dial tone]

234
00:13:54,586 --> 00:13:57,034
[siren on TV]

235
00:14:17,793 --> 00:14:20,586
- I wonder if I've given you
 the wrong impression tonight.

236
00:14:20,586 --> 00:14:21,862
I hope you don't think
 this is the first time

237
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,793
I've ever thought about it.

238
00:14:23,793 --> 00:14:26,620
I mean, what's
 happened to Donald.

239
00:14:27,862 --> 00:14:29,620
How could I not think about it?

240
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,758
For years now, ever since
 we all first heard about it,

241
00:14:31,758 --> 00:14:35,137
I wanted to say something
 to James, but I never did.

242
00:14:35,137 --> 00:14:36,068
I couldn't.

243
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:40,310
I was too scared to
 get the words out.

244
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,862
- Is that why you're not
telling me about James?

245
00:14:42,862 --> 00:14:44,448
- Telling you what?

246
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,137
- Is he all right, Audrey?

247
00:14:49,034 --> 00:14:51,310
Or does he have it too?

248
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:54,758
- Well of course he's all right.

249
00:14:54,758 --> 00:14:57,758
I'm sure he is, he must be.

250
00:14:57,758 --> 00:14:59,137
- You don't know?

251
00:15:00,517 --> 00:15:01,758
- Harry, if he wasn't all right,

252
00:15:01,758 --> 00:15:05,172
he would have told
 me, wouldn't he?

253
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:06,793
Yes, he would have.

254
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:10,310
- You didn't ask?

255
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,206
[soft piano music]

256
00:16:32,068 --> 00:16:33,068
- You hung up?

257
00:16:33,068 --> 00:16:35,379
Why did you hang up?

258
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:38,068
- Because I realized the
 instant I heard her voice

259
00:16:38,068 --> 00:16:39,931
there would be no point in it,

260
00:16:39,931 --> 00:16:43,206
when I told her who I was,
 and why I was calling.

261
00:16:43,206 --> 00:16:45,275
This is a woman for
 whom homosexuality

262
00:16:45,275 --> 00:16:48,068
is an offense against
 God, man, and nature.

263
00:16:48,068 --> 00:16:50,241
- Well, write her a letter.

264
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:52,586
Send her a wire,
 she should be told.

265
00:16:52,586 --> 00:16:55,551
Let her make up her own mind
 what she wants to do about it.

266
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,172
It would be hurtful for
 Donald if she doesn't come,

267
00:16:57,172 --> 00:16:59,448
but I think it's a
chance you have to take.

268
00:16:59,448 --> 00:17:01,137
- Well, I'm not telling Donald.

269
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:02,482
If she comes, he'll know.

270
00:17:02,482 --> 00:17:04,827
If she doesn't come, he
won't know I asked her,

271
00:17:04,827 --> 00:17:07,206
and he won't be hurt.

272
00:17:07,206 --> 00:17:08,896
I don't want him to be hurt.

273
00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:10,344
- I hadn't thought of that.

274
00:17:10,344 --> 00:17:13,000
So, how are you gonna do it?

275
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,793
- I thought of a way.

276
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,379
Hear me out.

277
00:17:17,379 --> 00:17:18,827
- Why wouldn't I?

278
00:17:20,034 --> 00:17:22,310
- You could do it.

279
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,827
You want me to phone
 her, no problem.

280
00:17:23,827 --> 00:17:24,655
- No.

281
00:17:25,724 --> 00:17:26,793
- You don't want
me to phone her?

282
00:17:26,793 --> 00:17:28,413
- No.

283
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:29,413
- I give up.

284
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,827
- You could go there.

285
00:17:32,827 --> 00:17:36,896
And speak to her face-to-face,
 and bring her back.

286
00:17:36,896 --> 00:17:38,275
I know, I know how this
sounds on first hearing.

287
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:39,793
You don't have to
 say anything now,

288
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:42,344
I'd rather you didn't, I'd
 rather you thought about it.

289
00:17:42,344 --> 00:17:44,172
But, not for too long.

290
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,034
- I think I have this right.

291
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:50,965
You want me to go to, where
 did you say she lives?

292
00:17:50,965 --> 00:17:51,965
- Arkansas.

293
00:17:51,965 --> 00:17:53,482
- Arkansas.

294
00:17:53,482 --> 00:17:55,655
And I go up and I
 knock on this door,

295
00:17:55,655 --> 00:17:57,482
and a perfect
 stranger answers it,

296
00:17:57,482 --> 00:18:01,137
and I presume I introduce
 myself, and then what?

297
00:18:01,137 --> 00:18:03,241
- You tell her that
 her son is gonna die,

298
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:06,000
and does she want to
see him before he dies?

299
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,172
- Oh James, I think there
 must be a better way.

300
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:10,413
- Tell me what it is.

301
00:18:10,413 --> 00:18:13,379
- You know I don't even
know where Arkansas is.

302
00:18:13,379 --> 00:18:16,137
- We'll locate Arkansas,
I know it's there.

303
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,827
- Oh, smart act isn't
 gonna win my heart, James.

304
00:18:18,827 --> 00:18:20,275
- She lives near Little Rock.

305
00:18:20,275 --> 00:18:21,793
You'd probably have
 to stay overnight,

306
00:18:21,793 --> 00:18:24,482
but you'd be there and back
 in less than 24 hours max.

307
00:18:24,482 --> 00:18:25,724
- With or without her.

308
00:18:25,724 --> 00:18:27,000
- Well even if it's without her,

309
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,068
it wouldn't have been
 a wasted trip, mother.

310
00:18:28,068 --> 00:18:31,379
Do you understand what I mean?

311
00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:33,758
Okay, well you don't
 have to decide now.

312
00:18:33,758 --> 00:18:37,482
Just sleep on it, would
you at least do that?

313
00:18:38,344 --> 00:18:39,517
I think I was about 10 years old

314
00:18:39,517 --> 00:18:43,137
the last time I asked
 you for a favor.

315
00:18:43,137 --> 00:18:45,000
If you do this for
 me, it'll be 20 more

316
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,310
before I ask you for
 another, I promise.

317
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,034
This is her name and address
 and telephone number,

318
00:18:52,034 --> 00:18:55,000
and the name of a
 hotel in Fayetteville.

319
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,896
If she'd listen to anyone,
 she might listen to you,

320
00:18:56,896 --> 00:18:58,275
the mother of a homosexual son.

321
00:18:58,275 --> 00:18:59,758
Do you understand what I mean?

322
00:18:59,758 --> 00:19:01,862
- Will you please stop
 asking me if I understand?

323
00:19:01,862 --> 00:19:03,344
Yes, I understand.

324
00:19:04,758 --> 00:19:07,379
There's one thing I
don't understand though.

325
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,862
I was talking to
 Harry last night.

326
00:19:08,862 --> 00:19:10,172
- Oh is that on again?

327
00:19:10,172 --> 00:19:11,758
- No.

328
00:19:11,758 --> 00:19:14,172
He said he knows me a
 lot, and you a little bit,

329
00:19:14,172 --> 00:19:18,241
but you and me together
he doesn't know at all.

330
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:22,413
I'm beginning to wonder if
 I know you and me together.

331
00:19:22,413 --> 00:19:23,241
- Are you?

332
00:19:24,724 --> 00:19:26,517
- It seems to me like
 something's getting

333
00:19:26,517 --> 00:19:29,310
very complicated
all of a sudden.

334
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:32,482
- We're not getting,
 it always was.

335
00:19:32,482 --> 00:19:34,206
- What do you mean?

336
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,310
- And more so since Donald,

337
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,758
since Donald and I
 have been together.

338
00:19:40,758 --> 00:19:42,137
I think there was a
 certain degree of composure

339
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:45,448
in it for you when I
was a carefree bachelor,

340
00:19:45,448 --> 00:19:49,586
the dashing unattached
 young man about town.

341
00:19:49,586 --> 00:19:53,862
But enter Donald Barnes to
 share my home and heart.

342
00:19:53,862 --> 00:19:57,034
Well, that made things
 a little bit awkward.

343
00:19:57,034 --> 00:19:58,206
What could you do
 but distance yourself

344
00:19:58,206 --> 00:20:02,103
from so perversely
domestic an arrangement?

345
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:04,448
Distance yourself from
 the fact that was Donald,

346
00:20:04,448 --> 00:20:07,724
which was to distance
 yourself from me.

347
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,862
And what could I do,
 but respond in kind?

348
00:20:12,862 --> 00:20:17,275
Audrey says take three giant
 steps backward, and I did.

349
00:20:17,275 --> 00:20:18,379
- How did I do that?

350
00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:19,931
I really don't
understand this, James.

351
00:20:19,931 --> 00:20:23,689
- Well by almost never asking
 when we spoke, how is Donald?

352
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,517
By forgetting two of
 the three birthdays

353
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:27,965
he's had since
 we've been together.

354
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:29,482
By on more occasions
 than I can recall,

355
00:20:29,482 --> 00:20:32,517
inviting me out to
dinner, me, not Donald.

356
00:20:32,517 --> 00:20:33,344
By never--

357
00:20:37,172 --> 00:20:39,000
Well we need spiked
boots Mother, you and I,

358
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,620
to get over what's been
swept under the rug

359
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,689
since I was 18 years old.

360
00:20:43,965 --> 00:20:45,724
Mountains, mother.

361
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:47,586
- Would you explain that to me?

362
00:20:47,586 --> 00:20:48,482
- This isn't the time for it.

363
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:49,275
- Why not?

364
00:20:51,965 --> 00:20:55,517
- Because this is
 the time for Donald.

365
00:20:55,517 --> 00:20:57,758
And there isn't much of it.

366
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,965
- How much is there for you?

367
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:08,965
- I'm sorry.

368
00:21:10,137 --> 00:21:11,206
- I should have asked
 you the other night.

369
00:21:11,206 --> 00:21:13,379
I don't know why I didn't.

370
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:19,000
Do you have it, too?

371
00:21:20,172 --> 00:21:21,620
- I don't know, I
 haven't been tested.

372
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,965
I don't want to discuss it.

373
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:23,896
- [Audrey] James.

374
00:21:23,896 --> 00:21:25,068
- I don't want to discuss it.

375
00:21:25,068 --> 00:21:25,931
Do you?

376
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,137
Can you?

377
00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:37,034
[phone ringing]

378
00:21:38,758 --> 00:21:40,103
- Sally?

379
00:21:40,103 --> 00:21:41,137
- [Sally] Yo.

380
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:43,448
- See what the
 schedule of flights is

381
00:21:43,448 --> 00:21:45,379
to Little Rock
tomorrow, would you hon?

382
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:46,793
- Little Rock?

383
00:21:46,793 --> 00:21:48,275
- Arkansas.

384
00:21:48,275 --> 00:21:50,068
- You're going to Arkansas?

385
00:21:50,068 --> 00:21:51,655
What's in Arkansas?

386
00:21:54,724 --> 00:21:58,000
[soft orchestral music]

387
00:22:18,068 --> 00:22:20,965
- Okay we can be on our way now.

388
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,034
What did you say your name was?

389
00:22:22,034 --> 00:22:23,068
- Charley.

390
00:22:23,068 --> 00:22:23,931
You all settled in?

391
00:22:23,931 --> 00:22:24,862
- Yes.

392
00:22:24,862 --> 00:22:25,689
- How's your accommodations?

393
00:22:25,689 --> 00:22:26,620
- Great.

394
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,413
That's where we're going.

395
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:28,206
Do you know where it is?

396
00:22:28,206 --> 00:22:29,034
- You bet.

397
00:22:29,034 --> 00:22:29,896
- Is it far?

398
00:22:29,896 --> 00:22:31,137
- 30, 40 minutes.

399
00:22:31,137 --> 00:22:32,724
Your first time in
 Fayetteville, ma'am?

400
00:22:32,724 --> 00:22:34,000
- Yes.

401
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,586
- Well let's hope it
 won't be your last.

402
00:22:37,586 --> 00:22:41,241
[dramatic orchestral music]

403
00:22:50,241 --> 00:22:51,448
You want me to wait
 here for you ma'am?

404
00:22:51,448 --> 00:22:54,103
Or should I drive on in?

405
00:22:54,103 --> 00:22:55,344
- What's this?

406
00:22:55,344 --> 00:22:56,379
- Ma'am?

407
00:22:56,379 --> 00:22:57,793
- What is this?

408
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,241
- Well this here is the
address you gave me.

409
00:23:00,241 --> 00:23:01,793
- This is it?

410
00:23:01,793 --> 00:23:03,241
Well, this is a trailer park.

411
00:23:03,241 --> 00:23:04,310
- Yes, ma'am.

412
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,482
- But it says unit 16, I
assumed it was a condo.

413
00:23:09,482 --> 00:23:13,517
- No ma'am, if it's unit 16,
 that'd be one of the homettes.

414
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,827
- Homettes?

415
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:15,827
- Yes ma'am.

416
00:23:18,344 --> 00:23:20,172
- Okay, let's find it.

417
00:23:21,034 --> 00:23:24,689
[dramatic orchestral music]

418
00:23:34,103 --> 00:23:36,310
We know this was
 a mistake Audrey.

419
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,896
- Ma'am?

420
00:23:37,896 --> 00:23:40,965
- Stop and ask
 directions, would you?

421
00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:45,448
- Where's 16?

422
00:23:46,413 --> 00:23:47,517
- Take a right,

423
00:23:47,517 --> 00:23:48,862
first one.

424
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:51,068
Who you got in
 there, Ray Charles?

425
00:23:51,068 --> 00:23:52,413
- Don't you wish?

426
00:23:52,413 --> 00:23:54,655
[laughing]

427
00:24:05,931 --> 00:24:06,758
Keep back.

428
00:24:22,172 --> 00:24:23,172
- Excuse me.

429
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,655
[doorbell ringing]

430
00:24:48,965 --> 00:24:50,275
- Missus Barnes?

431
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:53,896
My name is Audrey Grant.

432
00:24:53,896 --> 00:24:55,137
- Yeah?

433
00:24:55,137 --> 00:24:57,344
- I wonder if I could
 have a word with you?

434
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,586
- What's going on?

435
00:24:58,586 --> 00:25:00,000
You sure you got the
 right party here?

436
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,931
- Yes, could I come in?

437
00:25:03,344 --> 00:25:05,413
- [Man] Hey Lu, what'd you do,
 win a contest or something?

438
00:25:05,413 --> 00:25:07,344
- That'll be the day.

439
00:25:07,344 --> 00:25:10,310
- [Man] Don't forget
that 20 you owe me, Lu.

440
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,862
- May I come in please?

441
00:25:12,862 --> 00:25:16,517
- It's either that or
 start selling tickets.

442
00:25:19,103 --> 00:25:22,896
- What are you doing
 pulling up in here?

443
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,344
- May I sit down?

444
00:25:24,344 --> 00:25:25,931
- Yeah yeah yeah,
 pull up a sofa.

445
00:25:25,931 --> 00:25:28,724
What'd you say your name was?

446
00:25:28,724 --> 00:25:29,965
- Audrey Grant.

447
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:34,034
I'm from San Diego, California.

448
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:35,655
- I know where San Diego is.

449
00:25:35,655 --> 00:25:39,000
- Yes well, I came
 to talk to you about,

450
00:25:40,896 --> 00:25:42,896
I'm here about your son.

451
00:25:43,931 --> 00:25:44,862
- What son?

452
00:25:46,275 --> 00:25:47,103
- Donald.

453
00:25:47,103 --> 00:25:48,551
Your son.

454
00:25:48,551 --> 00:25:49,793
I came to talk to you--

455
00:25:49,793 --> 00:25:51,827
- Who in the hell
 are you anyway?

456
00:25:51,827 --> 00:25:54,241
Not your name, I got your name.

457
00:25:54,241 --> 00:25:55,241
Who are you?

458
00:25:56,448 --> 00:25:57,793
- I'm a friend of Donald's.

459
00:25:57,793 --> 00:25:59,310
- Oh yeah?

460
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:03,551
- Through my son, Donald is a
 very close friend of my son's.

461
00:26:03,551 --> 00:26:04,379
- Uh huh.

462
00:26:05,517 --> 00:26:07,344
- He's extremely
 ill, Missus Barnes.

463
00:26:07,344 --> 00:26:08,275
- Your son's sick?

464
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,655
- No, not my son.

465
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:10,862
- What are you hollerin' about?

466
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:12,310
- I'm hollering
 because I don't know

467
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,379
what the hell I'm doing here,
 that's why I'm hollering.

468
00:26:14,379 --> 00:26:18,034
- Well if you don't
know lady, I sure don't.

469
00:26:19,448 --> 00:26:23,413
- Look, it's your son who's
 very ill, Missus Barnes.

470
00:26:23,413 --> 00:26:25,310
He hasn't long to live.

471
00:26:26,517 --> 00:26:29,655
I'm sorry, there's no
 easier way to say it.

472
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:30,896
- He's 28 years old.

473
00:26:30,896 --> 00:26:33,896
What's the matter with him?

474
00:26:33,896 --> 00:26:36,344
- He has a very serious illness.

475
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,827
- Those are generally
 the kind you die from,

476
00:26:37,827 --> 00:26:39,241
the serious ones.

477
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:44,862
- He has AIDS.

478
00:26:47,379 --> 00:26:48,551
- Yeah.

479
00:26:48,551 --> 00:26:50,310
Yeah, well I figured.

480
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:52,517
- You figured?

481
00:26:52,517 --> 00:26:54,827
- Well he's 28 years old
and he's one of them.

482
00:26:54,827 --> 00:26:56,241
What else could it be?

483
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:57,965
I mean, I watch TV.

484
00:26:57,965 --> 00:27:02,862
Two and two's been coming
 out four for a long time now.

485
00:27:02,862 --> 00:27:03,931
Want a drink?

486
00:27:04,862 --> 00:27:06,413
- I'd kill for one.

487
00:27:06,413 --> 00:27:09,310
- You can get one
 easier than that.

488
00:27:15,862 --> 00:27:17,931
- A little water, no ice.

489
00:27:19,068 --> 00:27:21,275
- God's will you know,
 this thing they get.

490
00:27:21,275 --> 00:27:23,034
You do know that don't you?

491
00:27:23,034 --> 00:27:25,344
- I know some
 people believe that.

492
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:28,310
- And you're not
 one of them, huh?

493
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,896
And you didn't come all this way

494
00:27:29,896 --> 00:27:31,862
just to tell me Donnie's
gonna die, did you?

495
00:27:31,862 --> 00:27:33,620
- I came to ask you if you
 would come back with me

496
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,758
and see him, it would
 mean the world to him.

497
00:27:36,758 --> 00:27:38,724
- A phone call would
have been a lot cheaper.

498
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:40,965
- Well, we decided this
would be the best way.

499
00:27:40,965 --> 00:27:43,172
- We? You and Donnie?

500
00:27:43,172 --> 00:27:46,413
- Donald knows nothing about
 this, it was my son's idea.

501
00:27:46,413 --> 00:27:50,620
Donald is a very close
friend of James, my son.

502
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,172
I just wanted to help.

503
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:55,137
- Uh, you said that,
 very close friend.

504
00:27:55,137 --> 00:27:56,517
How close?

505
00:27:56,517 --> 00:27:58,586
They only have one kind
of very close friend.

506
00:27:58,586 --> 00:28:00,379
- Look, it doesn't matter
 what kind of close.

507
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:01,586
- [Luanne] You son's
 one of them too?

508
00:28:01,586 --> 00:28:03,344
- Oh, my son has
nothing to do with this.

509
00:28:03,344 --> 00:28:05,551
- Wait I get the
picture here, yeah yeah.

510
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:08,586
Your son, my son, yeah I
bet they're real close.

511
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:10,413
What's all this beatin'
around the bush?

512
00:28:10,413 --> 00:28:13,448
- I don't normally
 beat around bushes.

513
00:28:13,448 --> 00:28:14,793
- You sure come a long way

514
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,655
to go a long way
 back for nothin'.

515
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:18,413
- Couldn't you at
 least think about it?

516
00:28:18,413 --> 00:28:19,655
- I don't have nothin'
 to think about.

517
00:28:19,655 --> 00:28:21,137
- Oh for the love of
 God, he's your child.

518
00:28:21,137 --> 00:28:23,137
He's dying, what does it
 matter what he's dying of?

519
00:28:23,137 --> 00:28:24,965
- The only problem I
 have is what I'm gonna

520
00:28:24,965 --> 00:28:26,793
tell these people
 here about you.

521
00:28:26,793 --> 00:28:28,310
You and your big car.

522
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,103
You and your big box clothes.

523
00:28:30,103 --> 00:28:32,275
- Look, I'm sorry about
that, it was a mistake.

524
00:28:32,275 --> 00:28:35,000
- Nobody here knows I've
 got a son who's one of them.

525
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,620
I wouldn't be able
 to show my face.

526
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,206
- He's gonna die
 you stupid bitch.

527
00:28:40,206 --> 00:28:42,034
- Well if he wasn't what he is,

528
00:28:42,034 --> 00:28:44,482
he wouldn't be gonna
 die now would he?

529
00:28:44,482 --> 00:28:46,034
Would he?

530
00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:47,689
I hated what he is.

531
00:28:47,689 --> 00:28:49,379
It turns my stomach.

532
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:50,379
You here me?

533
00:28:54,241 --> 00:28:56,241
- Get me out of here.

534
00:28:56,241 --> 00:28:58,310
Get me out of here quick.

535
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:02,551
[crowd talking]

536
00:29:02,551 --> 00:29:05,034
[dog barking]

537
00:29:08,344 --> 00:29:10,965
[horn honking]

538
00:29:29,896 --> 00:29:32,379
- By the by, how did Mom cope?

539
00:29:36,034 --> 00:29:37,034
Your mother?

540
00:29:38,172 --> 00:29:41,206
Audrey, how did she
survive her face-to-face

541
00:29:41,206 --> 00:29:44,862
confront with the grim
 reaper the other day?

542
00:29:44,862 --> 00:29:48,034
- She saw right through
 your flimsy tissue of wit,

543
00:29:48,034 --> 00:29:49,931
admired amongst us.

544
00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:52,965
- I thought she met them
all really well for her.

545
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:55,103
She seemed quite fearless.

546
00:29:56,275 --> 00:29:57,172
- Gin.

547
00:29:57,172 --> 00:29:58,793
- What?

548
00:29:58,793 --> 00:30:00,517
No mercy, even now?

549
00:30:00,517 --> 00:30:01,482
[toilet flushing]

550
00:30:01,482 --> 00:30:03,655
- See you later, Donald.

551
00:30:03,655 --> 00:30:07,586
- Your hair is like a
field of silver daisies.

552
00:30:07,586 --> 00:30:11,137
I'd like to run barefoot
through your hair.

553
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:17,206
They don't write movies
like that anymore.

554
00:30:18,793 --> 00:30:20,137
Mother for mother, I'd say mine

555
00:30:20,137 --> 00:30:23,551
has the better
 bargain of the two.

556
00:30:23,551 --> 00:30:27,344
One more hand, but
 only if I can cheat.

557
00:30:27,344 --> 00:30:29,344
- What better bargain?

558
00:30:29,344 --> 00:30:31,793
- To be spared all this dreck,

559
00:30:31,793 --> 00:30:34,448
blissful ignorance and all that.

560
00:30:35,862 --> 00:30:37,965
- How can you be so
 certain she'd want to be?

561
00:30:37,965 --> 00:30:40,068
- James, don't be a dunce.

562
00:30:41,655 --> 00:30:42,931
Who wouldn't want to be?

563
00:30:42,931 --> 00:30:45,862
Would you choose this
 if you had a choice?

564
00:30:45,862 --> 00:30:46,931
Would Audrey?

565
00:30:51,896 --> 00:30:52,689
I'm sorry.

566
00:30:55,344 --> 00:30:59,689
It's becoming time for
 another controlled substance,

567
00:30:59,689 --> 00:31:03,862
something by way of a mood
 elevator would be nice.

568
00:31:05,551 --> 00:31:07,000
- Here.

569
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,379
You want me to get the nurse?

570
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,965
- I'll be brave if you will.

571
00:31:26,965 --> 00:31:28,724
When are you gonna be?

572
00:31:28,724 --> 00:31:29,551
- What?

573
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:33,517
- Not brave, wrong
 word of course.

574
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,275
Sensible.

575
00:31:38,827 --> 00:31:40,827
When are you gonna be sensible?

576
00:31:40,827 --> 00:31:43,724
- I thought you promised
 not to bring that up again.

577
00:31:43,724 --> 00:31:44,517
- I lied.

578
00:31:46,275 --> 00:31:47,310
Please James,

579
00:31:48,655 --> 00:31:52,000
it just isn't rational
 not to be tested.

580
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,517
- If I promise to do it,
will you leave it alone?

581
00:31:53,517 --> 00:31:54,310
- Yeah.

582
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,724
Could be negative, James.

583
00:32:01,724 --> 00:32:03,620
- Shall we calculate the
astronomical odds against that?

584
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,344
Let's find the nearest computer.

585
00:32:05,344 --> 00:32:06,827
- Michael Roby
 died two years ago,

586
00:32:06,827 --> 00:32:08,275
and Peter is still
 testing negative.

587
00:32:08,275 --> 00:32:09,689
- Peter wants to know, Donald.

588
00:32:09,689 --> 00:32:11,551
- Yes, and if God forbid
he does go positive,

589
00:32:11,551 --> 00:32:12,793
at least he'll have the earliest

590
00:32:12,793 --> 00:32:15,103
treatment possible, won't he?

591
00:32:15,103 --> 00:32:17,413
As I might have had when I
 was still in the denial mode

592
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:19,068
of me, it can't happen to me.

593
00:32:19,068 --> 00:32:21,896
- It's my choice, Donald.

594
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:22,724
Mine.

595
00:32:30,689 --> 00:32:33,241
- I think I'm gonna win,

596
00:32:33,241 --> 00:32:36,172
and I haven't
 started cheating yet.

597
00:32:39,413 --> 00:32:41,655
- I gave it my best
 hon, really I did.

598
00:32:41,655 --> 00:32:43,206
- [James] Mission impossible.

599
00:32:43,206 --> 00:32:46,137
- She's one of those,
it's-God's-curse people.

600
00:32:46,137 --> 00:32:47,000
- Oh yeah.

601
00:32:48,206 --> 00:32:50,275
Thank you for trying
 Mother, I mean that.

602
00:32:50,275 --> 00:32:51,137
- You're welcome.

603
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:52,448
I hate her guts.

604
00:32:53,827 --> 00:32:56,206
- It's a new chapter
 for your memoirs.

605
00:32:56,206 --> 00:32:57,413
Come home.

606
00:32:57,413 --> 00:32:58,965
- You know what's gonna
happen, don't you?

607
00:32:58,965 --> 00:33:01,206
On the plane tomorrow I'll
think of exactly the magic words

608
00:33:01,206 --> 00:33:03,793
I could have used, that
 would have had her with me.

609
00:33:03,793 --> 00:33:06,413
- No you won't,
 there aren't any.

610
00:33:06,413 --> 00:33:09,068
[country music]

611
00:33:12,206 --> 00:33:14,586
- Come on Lu, give us
 a break, who was she?

612
00:33:14,586 --> 00:33:15,862
- None of your business.

613
00:33:15,862 --> 00:33:18,241
- It's all gonna come
 out sooner or later.

614
00:33:18,241 --> 00:33:20,689
I'm guessing some old rich uncle

615
00:33:20,689 --> 00:33:22,689
you didn't know you
 had bought the farm,

616
00:33:22,689 --> 00:33:24,965
and left you a fortune.

617
00:33:24,965 --> 00:33:25,793
- Be real.

618
00:33:26,724 --> 00:33:28,965
- Wish I'd been there.

619
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,413
The way I heard it,

620
00:33:30,413 --> 00:33:34,103
we're talking lifestyles
 of the rich and disgusting.

621
00:33:34,103 --> 00:33:36,379
- Come on Lu, spill it.

622
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:39,620
- Okay, okay, I won
 a contest all right?

623
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,448
- No kidding?

624
00:33:40,448 --> 00:33:41,689
- No.

625
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:42,344
- Well now we're
 getting somewhere.

626
00:33:42,344 --> 00:33:43,172
What contest?

627
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,413
- Mother of the year.

628
00:33:50,689 --> 00:33:52,862
[thunder]

629
00:34:11,344 --> 00:34:13,517
[raining]

630
00:34:47,724 --> 00:34:51,206
[sentimental flute music]

631
00:35:36,068 --> 00:35:38,758
[phone ringing]

632
00:35:46,517 --> 00:35:47,344
- Yes.

633
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:49,517
Hello?

634
00:35:51,758 --> 00:35:52,586
Hello?

635
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:56,379
- Is he really gonna die?

636
00:36:37,172 --> 00:36:39,344
- I admire you a lot for this.

637
00:36:39,344 --> 00:36:41,172
- I'm not doing
 this to be admired.

638
00:36:41,172 --> 00:36:42,896
- I know that.

639
00:36:42,896 --> 00:36:45,724
- I'm honestly not
 sure why I'm doing it.

640
00:36:45,724 --> 00:36:48,206
- Well, maybe you'll find out.

641
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,551
- I generally like to have

642
00:36:51,551 --> 00:36:55,000
the finding out part
 of things before.

643
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
It's easier with less of
 the why-did-I-do-its after.

644
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,310
Too many why-did-I-do-its
 tend to get you down,

645
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:02,068
you know what I mean?

646
00:37:03,448 --> 00:37:05,551
- How soon can you leave?

647
00:37:07,103 --> 00:37:09,068
- Well, got a boss
 to tell I won't be in

648
00:37:09,068 --> 00:37:12,000
for a couple of days,
 throw some stuff together.

649
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,137
Aside from that,
anytime I guess.

650
00:37:15,137 --> 00:37:16,413
- Well, there's plenty of time,

651
00:37:16,413 --> 00:37:19,620
the plane doesn't
 leave until 6:30.

652
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,310
- What plane?

653
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,241
- To Little Rock,

654
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:23,206
there's a short layover there

655
00:37:23,206 --> 00:37:24,724
to change planes for San Diego.

656
00:37:24,724 --> 00:37:27,137
- Change what planes?

657
00:37:27,137 --> 00:37:29,517
- Well we have to fly
 from here to Little Rock,

658
00:37:29,517 --> 00:37:31,655
on this little commuter airline.

659
00:37:31,655 --> 00:37:33,172
- You mean you
 didn't come direct?

660
00:37:33,172 --> 00:37:34,103
- From San Diego?

661
00:37:34,103 --> 00:37:34,965
- Yeah.

662
00:37:34,965 --> 00:37:36,413
- No.

663
00:37:36,413 --> 00:37:39,413
There are no direct flights
from San Diego to Fayetteville.

664
00:37:39,413 --> 00:37:42,310
But it's a quick trip
 from here to Little Rock.

665
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:45,034
- Oh yeah, I took a quick trip

666
00:37:45,034 --> 00:37:46,689
on one of their airplanes once.

667
00:37:46,689 --> 00:37:49,275
Lasted about half a minute.

668
00:37:49,275 --> 00:37:51,413
- [Audrey] What do you mean?

669
00:37:51,413 --> 00:37:54,793
- The propeller stopped turning.

670
00:37:54,793 --> 00:37:56,137
- What happened?

671
00:37:56,137 --> 00:37:58,310
- What happened is
 the plane crashed.

672
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,206
The wings don't flap you know.

673
00:38:00,206 --> 00:38:02,310
- My God, were you badly hurt?

674
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,655
- Broke my knee.

675
00:38:05,206 --> 00:38:07,310
Two people killed though.

676
00:38:08,482 --> 00:38:10,241
I'll be driving.

677
00:38:10,241 --> 00:38:11,517
- I beg your pardon?

678
00:38:11,517 --> 00:38:15,000
- To Little Rock,
 meet you there.

679
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,655
- Driving?

680
00:38:16,655 --> 00:38:17,482
- Yeah.

681
00:38:19,793 --> 00:38:21,793
- You won't fly?

682
00:38:21,793 --> 00:38:23,275
- On one of them little things?

683
00:38:23,275 --> 00:38:24,586
No way.

684
00:38:24,586 --> 00:38:26,068
- Do you know what the odds are

685
00:38:26,068 --> 00:38:28,758
against your ever being in
 an accident like that again?

686
00:38:28,758 --> 00:38:29,965
If you live to be 200.

687
00:38:29,965 --> 00:38:32,000
- I'll tell you what
 it's about lady.

688
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,137
Being laid up in bed
 scared cross-eyed

689
00:38:34,137 --> 00:38:36,413
for about a week after
 is what it's about.

690
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:38,655
Waking up in sweats, three
 or four times a year,

691
00:38:38,655 --> 00:38:41,344
to the present day,
that's what it's about.

692
00:38:41,344 --> 00:38:42,862
I'm not flying in
 nothin' that has less

693
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:46,931
than three or four
 humongous jet motors.

694
00:38:46,931 --> 00:38:48,482
Get one of them to
 make a little detour

695
00:38:48,482 --> 00:38:51,724
to Fayetteville
 Airport, no problem.

696
00:38:51,724 --> 00:38:54,344
- I don't think I
 could arrange that.

697
00:38:54,344 --> 00:38:56,517
- Meet you in Little Rock.

698
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:00,965
- Wait.

699
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:03,000
How long is the
 drive to Little Rock?

700
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,586
- About four hours.

701
00:39:05,793 --> 00:39:08,448
- I'd really rather
 we went together.

702
00:39:08,448 --> 00:39:11,586
- Why, afraid I
 might change my mind?

703
00:39:11,586 --> 00:39:12,758
- Can you honestly tell me

704
00:39:12,758 --> 00:39:14,275
I don't have to
 concerned about that?

705
00:39:14,275 --> 00:39:16,724
Look, I don't know
you, you don't know me,

706
00:39:16,724 --> 00:39:19,206
but I do know how hard
 this is for you to do.

707
00:39:19,206 --> 00:39:22,103
And I know that part of you
 still doesn't want to do it.

708
00:39:22,103 --> 00:39:23,310
- You sure know a hell of a lot

709
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,482
for somebody that don't
know me, don't you?

710
00:39:25,482 --> 00:39:27,034
- Oh for God's sake how
 could I have sat with you

711
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:29,275
yesterday in that trailer
 and listened to you

712
00:39:29,275 --> 00:39:30,689
and not know that?

713
00:39:30,689 --> 00:39:32,000
Maybe you could
 use some help to do

714
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,862
what I think you
most want to do.

715
00:39:34,862 --> 00:39:38,724
Four hours can be an awfully
 long time to go without help.

716
00:39:38,724 --> 00:39:42,482
- I'm not flying to
 Little Rock, case closed.

717
00:39:42,482 --> 00:39:43,655
- No you're not.

718
00:39:43,655 --> 00:39:46,068
We're driving to
 Little Rock, together.

719
00:39:46,068 --> 00:39:49,310
- It's a pretty
 drive, right now.

720
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:53,172
Just tell me where you
want me to pick you up.

721
00:39:53,172 --> 00:39:55,344
- Does this have
 air conditioning?

722
00:39:55,344 --> 00:39:59,000
- No, but it has windows
that you roll down.

723
00:40:01,586 --> 00:40:03,413
- I have a suggestion.

724
00:40:04,517 --> 00:40:05,724
Well I can't guarantee
 anything James,

725
00:40:05,724 --> 00:40:08,034
this is strictly
 one step at a time.

726
00:40:08,034 --> 00:40:11,000
She's a tough hombre, I feel
 like I'm walking on eggs.

727
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,586
How's Donald?

728
00:40:12,586 --> 00:40:14,172
- A bit of an
 upswing this morning.

729
00:40:14,172 --> 00:40:15,827
- [Audrey] Is that good?

730
00:40:15,827 --> 00:40:17,379
- What goes up.

731
00:40:17,379 --> 00:40:18,551
- Well, okay.

732
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:20,172
Look, as of this moment,
we're on our way.

733
00:40:20,172 --> 00:40:21,862
We'll be in San Diego tonight.

734
00:40:21,862 --> 00:40:23,586
I almost had to drive
 with her in her car

735
00:40:23,586 --> 00:40:24,965
all the way to Little Rock.

736
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:27,103
Looks like a discard
 from Rent a Wreck.

737
00:40:27,103 --> 00:40:28,344
- Not a pretty picture,

738
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:30,241
I assume you made
 other arrangements.

739
00:40:30,241 --> 00:40:32,827
[fiddle music]

740
00:40:58,931 --> 00:41:01,068
- Okay, we're out of here.

741
00:41:14,862 --> 00:41:17,413
[car starting]

742
00:41:46,689 --> 00:41:47,724
- No, thanks.

743
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:57,000
- Doesn't that ruin the air
conditioning, putting that down?

744
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,103
- It's just while
 you're smoking.

745
00:41:58,103 --> 00:41:59,344
I used to do that.

746
00:41:59,344 --> 00:42:00,896
I don't want to get re-hooked.

747
00:42:00,896 --> 00:42:03,310
It's a daily threat at best.

748
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:04,551
- Is it gonna be a problem?

749
00:42:04,551 --> 00:42:07,310
- No, go right
 ahead, no problem.

750
00:42:10,827 --> 00:42:13,137
- I've never been in a
 car like this before.

751
00:42:13,137 --> 00:42:16,034
I guess you figured that out.

752
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,862
I'd really love to
 hear that radio,

753
00:42:17,862 --> 00:42:19,862
if I could just find it.

754
00:42:25,586 --> 00:42:28,241
[country music]

755
00:42:39,344 --> 00:42:42,724
- I have to find a place
 to stay when we get there.

756
00:42:42,724 --> 00:42:44,137
- It's all taken care of.

757
00:42:44,137 --> 00:42:46,034
We booked you a hotel room.

758
00:42:46,034 --> 00:42:47,413
- Hope it's in my budget.

759
00:42:47,413 --> 00:42:48,241
- You don't have to
 think about that,

760
00:42:48,241 --> 00:42:50,379
it's all taken care of.

761
00:42:50,379 --> 00:42:54,241
- I don't need it to
 be all taken care of.

762
00:42:54,241 --> 00:42:55,034
- Okay.

763
00:42:57,724 --> 00:43:00,206
How'd it go with your boss
 getting some time off?

764
00:43:00,206 --> 00:43:01,448
- Fine.

765
00:43:01,448 --> 00:43:04,241
I was a bit shifty
 about how long.

766
00:43:05,241 --> 00:43:07,724
What kind of time does he have?

767
00:43:07,724 --> 00:43:08,965
- It's hard to say.

768
00:43:08,965 --> 00:43:11,000
- [Luanne] Not long?

769
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,620
- A week,

770
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,448
maybe two.

771
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,137
- I haven't seen
him in 11 years.

772
00:43:21,137 --> 00:43:23,827
He was 17 when I kicked him out.

773
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:27,379
- Do you have any
 other children?

774
00:43:27,379 --> 00:43:31,206
- Yeah, I have two daughters
 from my second marriage.

775
00:43:31,206 --> 00:43:34,034
One lives in Ohio,
 one's in Florida,

776
00:43:34,034 --> 00:43:36,379
we get together on holidays.

777
00:43:38,551 --> 00:43:40,896
- So, you English, huh?

778
00:43:40,896 --> 00:43:41,724
- Yes.

779
00:43:42,689 --> 00:43:44,586
- Your son is, too?

780
00:43:44,586 --> 00:43:46,965
- He was born here.

781
00:43:46,965 --> 00:43:49,448
- I never met anybody English.

782
00:43:51,448 --> 00:43:53,172
How about a pit stop?

783
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,655
How'd you find out
 what your kid was?

784
00:43:57,655 --> 00:43:59,689
I found out by asking,
 how'd you find out?

785
00:43:59,689 --> 00:44:00,724
- He told me.

786
00:44:00,724 --> 00:44:02,862
- You mean you asked him?

787
00:44:02,862 --> 00:44:04,793
- He told me, I
 didn't have to ask.

788
00:44:04,793 --> 00:44:06,448
- You already
 figured it out, huh?

789
00:44:06,448 --> 00:44:07,275
- Uh huh.

790
00:44:08,931 --> 00:44:10,413
- I had to ask,

791
00:44:10,413 --> 00:44:13,586
not that I wasn't already
 wondering, long before.

792
00:44:13,586 --> 00:44:17,137
He got to be 15, 16, never
 any girls in the picture.

793
00:44:17,137 --> 00:44:20,034
Hell, you'd have to be a real
 dolt not to start wondering.

794
00:44:20,034 --> 00:44:21,827
- James had a girlfriend
in high school.

795
00:44:21,827 --> 00:44:22,758
- What do you mean?

796
00:44:22,758 --> 00:44:23,931
A real girlfriend?

797
00:44:23,931 --> 00:44:25,379
- Yeah.

798
00:44:25,379 --> 00:44:28,413
- Why, you know what I
 mean, they had relations?

799
00:44:28,413 --> 00:44:29,862
- Sure.

800
00:44:29,862 --> 00:44:31,379
- How do you know?

801
00:44:31,379 --> 00:44:32,655
- Well, for one thing she
 spent the night with him,

802
00:44:32,655 --> 00:44:33,931
in our house.

803
00:44:33,931 --> 00:44:35,034
- Well maybe nothin' happened.

804
00:44:35,034 --> 00:44:36,241
- Oh, it happened.

805
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:38,206
- How do you know?

806
00:44:38,206 --> 00:44:40,068
- She was a screamer.

807
00:44:40,068 --> 00:44:42,931
[Luanne laughing]

808
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:45,827
- I just can't figure out,

809
00:44:45,827 --> 00:44:48,586
a kid'd jump the fence after
 he had a taste of normal.

810
00:44:48,586 --> 00:44:50,034
I get the feeling

811
00:44:50,034 --> 00:44:53,448
that you got no problem
 about your kid being queer.

812
00:44:53,448 --> 00:44:55,586
- I didn't throw
 him out of his home.

813
00:44:55,586 --> 00:44:56,827
- You like what he is?

814
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:58,724
- It's not a question
of liking or not liking,

815
00:44:58,724 --> 00:45:00,758
it's a question of
 accepting what he is.

816
00:45:00,758 --> 00:45:02,551
And I'd rather you
 didn't use that word,

817
00:45:02,551 --> 00:45:04,068
especially when we get there.

818
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:05,206
- What word?

819
00:45:05,206 --> 00:45:06,413
- Queer.

820
00:45:06,413 --> 00:45:08,241
- Tell me something,

821
00:45:08,241 --> 00:45:09,724
if you had your pick,

822
00:45:09,724 --> 00:45:13,206
between your boy being
 what he is, or be normal,

823
00:45:13,206 --> 00:45:14,896
what would you pick?

824
00:45:27,241 --> 00:45:29,206
- Is he your friend?

825
00:45:29,206 --> 00:45:30,034
- Yeah.

826
00:45:32,379 --> 00:45:33,896
- He's my husband.

827
00:45:36,206 --> 00:45:37,034
- Sorry.

828
00:45:38,413 --> 00:45:39,655
- I got it too.

829
00:45:51,172 --> 00:45:52,103
- I'm here.

830
00:45:53,965 --> 00:45:55,620
- Of course you are.

831
00:45:57,482 --> 00:45:59,103
- Anything you want?

832
00:46:01,103 --> 00:46:04,793
- I wanted it to [muffled].

833
00:46:12,517 --> 00:46:15,172
Are you thinking about New York?

834
00:46:16,275 --> 00:46:18,689
I'm so sorry about New York.

835
00:46:18,689 --> 00:46:20,241
- Shut up.

836
00:46:20,241 --> 00:46:23,827
- Geez, you were
planning for it.

837
00:46:23,827 --> 00:46:25,758
- I'll always love you.

838
00:46:29,275 --> 00:46:31,793
- You're like a Christmas guy.

839
00:46:32,965 --> 00:46:33,965
So fabulous.

840
00:46:36,517 --> 00:46:41,000
If we'd have ever done it,
 we'd have done it together.

841
00:46:47,103 --> 00:46:51,275
There are eight million
 stories in the naked city,

842
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:54,000
and that will not
 be one of them.

843
00:47:02,724 --> 00:47:06,103
- [Luanne] I don't know
 what I'm gonna say to him.

844
00:47:06,103 --> 00:47:07,448
- [Audrey] what?

845
00:47:07,448 --> 00:47:08,965
- Donnie.

846
00:47:08,965 --> 00:47:13,275
I just don't know what
 I'm gonna say to him.

847
00:47:13,275 --> 00:47:15,034
- Don't worry about that.

848
00:47:15,034 --> 00:47:17,896
- It's easy for
 you to say, honey.

849
00:47:19,034 --> 00:47:21,517
- Look, why don't
 you call me Audrey,

850
00:47:21,517 --> 00:47:23,379
and I'll call you Luanne.

851
00:47:23,379 --> 00:47:25,586
So much better than you
 calling me honey all the time,

852
00:47:25,586 --> 00:47:28,689
and me calling you nothing.

853
00:47:28,689 --> 00:47:30,586
- You like this music?
 [classical music]

854
00:47:30,586 --> 00:47:31,586
- I do, yes.

855
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:35,137
- You like jazz by any chance?

856
00:47:35,137 --> 00:47:36,379
- I love jazz.

857
00:47:36,379 --> 00:47:37,379
- Me too.

858
00:47:37,379 --> 00:47:38,206
Get some.

859
00:47:44,517 --> 00:47:47,172
[big band jazz]

860
00:47:50,275 --> 00:47:51,517
What did he do?

861
00:47:52,758 --> 00:47:54,241
- I'm sorry.

862
00:47:54,241 --> 00:47:58,068
- Donnie, for a living,
 what did he end up doing?

863
00:47:58,068 --> 00:47:58,931
- He was,

864
00:48:00,724 --> 00:48:02,931
he's an architect.

865
00:48:02,931 --> 00:48:04,551
- No fooling?

866
00:48:04,551 --> 00:48:06,344
- He's designed some
 beautiful houses.

867
00:48:06,344 --> 00:48:08,482
He designed mine.

868
00:48:08,482 --> 00:48:10,379
- No fooling?

869
00:48:10,379 --> 00:48:12,344
- And he owns a small cinema.

870
00:48:12,344 --> 00:48:14,896
He's insane about old movies.

871
00:48:14,896 --> 00:48:17,827
He can quote entire
 scenes from memory.

872
00:48:17,827 --> 00:48:22,206
But that's just a sideline,
he's an architect by profession.

873
00:48:22,206 --> 00:48:25,620
- Well, he was always
 drawing when he was a kid.

874
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:28,551
Castles, he drew a lot of them.

875
00:48:28,551 --> 00:48:30,103
- [Audrey] Castles?

876
00:48:31,517 --> 00:48:33,275
- Yeah, a lot of 'em.

877
00:48:37,689 --> 00:48:39,448
- Have you ever
 been to California?

878
00:48:39,448 --> 00:48:41,448
- No, been to Las Vegas.

879
00:48:44,689 --> 00:48:46,931
Your son don't have it, does he?

00:48:48,172 --> 00:48:49,206
You son don't have it.

882
00:48:49,206 --> 00:48:51,275
You don't act like he's got it.

883
00:48:51,275 --> 00:48:52,517
- I don't know.

884
00:48:53,413 --> 00:48:54,896
- You don't know?

885
00:48:54,896 --> 00:48:56,862
- He doesn't know.

886
00:48:56,862 --> 00:48:58,068
- Well how come?

887
00:48:58,068 --> 00:48:59,448
Don't you get a
 test or something?

888
00:48:59,448 --> 00:49:02,034
- He hasn't done that yet.

889
00:49:02,034 --> 00:49:05,275
- Well how come, seeing
as how Donnie's got it?

890
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,724
- It doesn't always
 happen that way.

891
00:49:06,724 --> 00:49:09,379
They don't all get it, you know.

892
00:49:11,724 --> 00:49:13,413
- I saw this thing on the news,

893
00:49:13,413 --> 00:49:16,655
where a person can have it
 and not even know he's got it.

894
00:49:16,655 --> 00:49:19,931
Like it don't show up for
 a long time, sometimes.

895
00:49:19,931 --> 00:49:21,551
- Just think about Donald, okay?

896
00:49:21,551 --> 00:49:24,965
He's the one we should
 be thinking about.

897
00:49:58,482 --> 00:50:00,137
- I want to go home.

898
00:50:02,862 --> 00:50:04,689
- What else would we do there?

899
00:50:04,689 --> 00:50:06,793
- I want to go home.

900
00:50:06,793 --> 00:50:08,103
What do you say?

901
00:50:10,103 --> 00:50:11,034
Home James.

902
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
- All right.

903
00:50:21,379 --> 00:50:24,413
I have something to tell you.

904
00:50:24,413 --> 00:50:26,827
- You know it's real hard
 for me to believe that

905
00:50:26,827 --> 00:50:28,793
there's any mother who
 wouldn't be bothered

906
00:50:28,793 --> 00:50:31,827
by her son being one of them.

907
00:50:31,827 --> 00:50:35,551
You as easy about
 it as you let on?

908
00:50:35,551 --> 00:50:38,068
- I wanted to be a
grandmother, all right?

909
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:39,724
I can't help that what
 people do in private

910
00:50:39,724 --> 00:50:41,448
is nobody's business.

911
00:50:42,827 --> 00:50:44,034
I could tell you some stories
 about straight couples

912
00:50:44,034 --> 00:50:45,620
that would curl your hair.

913
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:49,655
- Oh, my hair stopped
curling a long time ago.

914
00:50:49,655 --> 00:50:52,551
I either heard it,
 or I been there.

915
00:50:54,517 --> 00:50:55,965
- Why is it different?

916
00:50:55,965 --> 00:50:58,275
- Just is that's all.

917
00:50:58,275 --> 00:51:00,931
- You have to do
 better than that.

918
00:51:00,931 --> 00:51:02,000
- No I don't.

919
00:51:03,896 --> 00:51:05,310
- We have to try.

920
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:10,000
- We? I thought we
 was talking about me?

921
00:51:11,275 --> 00:51:12,862
- I don't believe
 I'm hearing this.

922
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:16,655
Why didn't you tell me you
 were doing this, James?

923
00:51:16,655 --> 00:51:18,379
- If she'd refused, I didn't
 want you to know that.

924
00:51:18,379 --> 00:51:19,206
- Why didn't she?

925
00:51:19,206 --> 00:51:21,068
Why is she coming?

926
00:51:21,068 --> 00:51:22,344
- [James] To see you,
 of course, why else?

927
00:51:22,344 --> 00:51:23,793
- Why, last chance Luanne,

928
00:51:23,793 --> 00:51:25,758
grab it while you can,
 and make it quick.

929
00:51:25,758 --> 00:51:27,172
- If you like.

930
00:51:27,172 --> 00:51:28,689
- You're assuming
 good intentions.

931
00:51:28,689 --> 00:51:29,517
- We have to.

932
00:51:29,517 --> 00:51:30,689
- You have to.

933
00:51:32,413 --> 00:51:34,068
What if they go bad?

934
00:51:36,689 --> 00:51:39,344
You don't know what she's
 like, James, or was.

935
00:51:39,344 --> 00:51:43,137
Compared to my mother, yours
has been a picnic at the beach.

936
00:51:43,137 --> 00:51:44,000
Has she changed?

937
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,689
What does Audrey say?

938
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:50,000
- Evidently not.

939
00:51:51,758 --> 00:51:54,793
- I don't think I
 can handle this.

940
00:51:54,793 --> 00:51:56,103
- Tell me you really
 don't want to see her,

941
00:51:56,103 --> 00:51:57,344
and we'll put her on a plane

942
00:51:57,344 --> 00:51:58,758
back to Arkansas
 tomorrow morning.

943
00:51:58,758 --> 00:51:59,586
Can you tell me that?

944
00:51:59,586 --> 00:52:00,413
- Yes.

945
00:52:01,275 --> 00:52:02,275
- All right.

946
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:10,206
- No.

947
00:52:11,965 --> 00:52:13,413
- It's worth the risk.

948
00:52:13,413 --> 00:52:16,931
I have no right to say
 that, it's your risk, but

949
00:52:16,931 --> 00:52:20,379
I think it's one
you should take.

950
00:52:20,379 --> 00:52:23,896
- Mother of mercy is
 this the end of Rico?

951
00:52:26,206 --> 00:52:27,310
- All right, it
 rings the same bell,

952
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,655
but you have me on that one.

953
00:52:31,137 --> 00:52:33,310
- Edward G Robinson,

954
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:34,482
Little Caesar.

955
00:52:37,724 --> 00:52:40,206
Supine on a dark, ugly street,

956
00:52:42,068 --> 00:52:46,000
riddled with the bullets
of implacable justice,

957
00:52:48,137 --> 00:52:53,034
gasping his last desperate
pleas with his spiritual mother.

958
00:52:54,068 --> 00:52:55,758
Of course he dies.

959
00:52:55,758 --> 00:52:57,241
- That was a movie.

960
00:52:59,724 --> 00:53:00,551
- James,

961
00:53:03,206 --> 00:53:04,551
life is a movie.

962
00:53:09,931 --> 00:53:11,862
- How was the trip?

963
00:53:11,862 --> 00:53:14,344
- Flying used to be fun.

964
00:53:14,344 --> 00:53:16,275
- Is the hotel the first stop?

965
00:53:16,275 --> 00:53:18,000
- Nope, we're not
 going to the hotel,

966
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,241
we're going right to the house.

967
00:53:19,241 --> 00:53:20,068
- You bet.

968
00:53:21,586 --> 00:53:24,000
- You can stay with me, okay?

969
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,206
- Look honey, Audrey,
 if I change me mind,

970
00:53:27,206 --> 00:53:29,586
I can check out of your house
 as quick as I could a hotel.

971
00:53:29,586 --> 00:53:30,448
- Okay.

972
00:53:30,448 --> 00:53:31,275
- Thanks.

973
00:53:31,275 --> 00:53:32,724
- You're welcome.

974
00:53:38,275 --> 00:53:41,793
[gentle orchestral music]

975
00:54:03,896 --> 00:54:05,448
How are you doing?

976
00:54:05,448 --> 00:54:07,000
- Good, fine.

977
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,586
- Is there anything else
you need, in your room?

978
00:54:09,586 --> 00:54:13,137
- I couldn't think of
 anything else if I tried.

979
00:54:13,137 --> 00:54:14,000
Look,

980
00:54:14,862 --> 00:54:16,000
I don't want to come across here

981
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,448
like a redneck
 hillbilly or nothin',

982
00:54:17,448 --> 00:54:20,000
but I feel like I'm in Dynasty.

983
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,103
I mean that's the way I feel.

984
00:54:22,103 --> 00:54:24,137
I mean why shouldn't I say it?

985
00:54:24,137 --> 00:54:25,931
- I know what you mean.

986
00:54:25,931 --> 00:54:29,344
You know, I wasn't born
 choking on a silver spoon.

987
00:54:29,344 --> 00:54:30,689
- Sort of look like you were.

988
00:54:30,689 --> 00:54:32,379
- My father was a bank teller.

989
00:54:32,379 --> 00:54:33,724
- No kidding?

990
00:54:33,724 --> 00:54:35,000
Mine was a painter,

991
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
houses, not the other kind.

992
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,241
I got a friend, a guy,

993
00:54:40,241 --> 00:54:42,000
who says the trouble
 with this country is

994
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,551
everybody wants
 to be in Dynasty,

995
00:54:43,551 --> 00:54:46,172
and it isn't near big enough so

996
00:54:46,172 --> 00:54:49,965
there's a lot of angry
 people running around.

997
00:54:51,482 --> 00:54:53,482
Could I trouble you for a drink?

998
00:54:53,482 --> 00:54:55,137
- Oh, I'll join you.

999
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:02,551
- So, Donnie made
 this house, huh?

1000
00:55:02,551 --> 00:55:04,448
I mean, he drew it up?

1001
00:55:04,448 --> 00:55:06,793
- Yes, that's how
 he and James met.

1002
00:55:06,793 --> 00:55:08,620
Through me, the house.

1003
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:15,000
- You know what just
 come to me before?

1004
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,034
You're the only other
 person I ever met like me.

1005
00:55:18,034 --> 00:55:18,965
- Like you?

1006
00:55:18,965 --> 00:55:19,793
- Yeah.

1007
00:55:21,517 --> 00:55:25,206
The only other mother
 who's got a son like I got.

1008
00:55:25,206 --> 00:55:28,758
- You've known that
 since yesterday.

1009
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:31,068
- Well, I wasn't thinking
 about it that way,

1010
00:55:31,068 --> 00:55:33,793
not the way it's
 coming to me now.

1011
00:55:33,793 --> 00:55:36,793
There's a logical way to
 think about things, you know.

1012
00:55:36,793 --> 00:55:37,689
It's true.

1013
00:55:40,206 --> 00:55:43,758
I guess I'm not the first
 person for you though, I mean,

1014
00:55:43,758 --> 00:55:45,620
the way you live,

1015
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:47,344
the kind of people you know.

1016
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:50,551
- I know one other mother
 with a homosexual son.

1017
00:55:50,551 --> 00:55:52,896
- So you had
 somebody to talk to?

1018
00:55:52,896 --> 00:55:54,896
- The subject never
 really came up.

1019
00:55:54,896 --> 00:55:57,275
- How could it never come up?

1020
00:55:57,275 --> 00:55:59,103
- Well she brought it up once,

1021
00:55:59,103 --> 00:56:01,137
but I didn't see any
 point in pursuing it.

1022
00:56:01,137 --> 00:56:02,034
- How come?

1023
00:56:03,379 --> 00:56:05,379
- There wasn't any
 point, that's all.

1024
00:56:05,379 --> 00:56:06,655
I didn't care to discuss it.

1025
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,482
What's the difference?

1026
00:56:09,793 --> 00:56:11,758
- It would have made a
 big difference to me.

1027
00:56:11,758 --> 00:56:16,310
I never said word one to
a living soul about it.

1028
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:18,482
- Well I like to think
it's been of some help.

1029
00:56:18,482 --> 00:56:19,413
- What has?

1030
00:56:20,827 --> 00:56:23,724
- Saying something about
it to a living soul.

1031
00:56:23,724 --> 00:56:24,931
- Is that what it's been to you?

1032
00:56:24,931 --> 00:56:25,862
A help?

1033
00:56:25,862 --> 00:56:26,689
- Me?

1034
00:56:29,068 --> 00:56:31,310
- I get the idea that

1035
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:33,137
you're not too talkie
 about it either.

1036
00:56:33,137 --> 00:56:34,413
Is that right?

1037
00:56:34,413 --> 00:56:35,862
- Well not for the same
reason you haven't been,

1038
00:56:35,862 --> 00:56:37,586
I don't need any help.

1039
00:56:37,586 --> 00:56:39,413
- Oh, that's right.

1040
00:56:39,413 --> 00:56:40,862
You're better'n me.

1041
00:56:40,862 --> 00:56:42,344
I keep forgetting.

1042
00:56:42,344 --> 00:56:44,655
- I never implied
 any such thing.

1043
00:56:44,655 --> 00:56:47,551
But I don't call my son a,

1044
00:56:47,551 --> 00:56:49,379
I don't call him ugly names.

1045
00:56:49,379 --> 00:56:51,275
- Words never passed
 your pretty lips, huh?

1046
00:56:51,275 --> 00:56:52,517
- Never.

1047
00:56:52,517 --> 00:56:55,517
- Not even before you
knew what your son was?

1048
00:56:55,517 --> 00:56:57,000
- Oh come on.

1049
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,551
Everybody uses ignorant
 words when they're young,

1050
00:56:58,551 --> 00:57:00,241
and don't know any better.

1051
00:57:00,241 --> 00:57:03,448
But some of us grow
 up, and know better.

1052
00:57:03,448 --> 00:57:06,448
- And some of us grow up
 and stay ignorant, right?

1053
00:57:06,448 --> 00:57:07,655
- I'm not trying to insult you,

1054
00:57:07,655 --> 00:57:09,551
stop putting words
 into my mouth.

1055
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:12,034
- Maybe there's some
 already in it, lady.

1056
00:57:12,034 --> 00:57:14,655
- You just cannot believe
 that I am not like you.

1057
00:57:14,655 --> 00:57:16,965
You want me to be like you.

1058
00:57:16,965 --> 00:57:18,448
Well, I'm not.

1059
00:57:18,448 --> 00:57:19,275
- Like me?

1060
00:57:20,551 --> 00:57:22,206
What do you mean, like me?

1061
00:57:22,206 --> 00:57:25,379
I got a son dying from what
 he is, and so could yours.

1062
00:57:25,379 --> 00:57:27,275
I just wanted
 Donnie to be normal.

1063
00:57:27,275 --> 00:57:29,344
I would have had a
 son all these years.

1064
00:57:29,344 --> 00:57:30,275
That's all I wanted.

1065
00:57:30,275 --> 00:57:32,275
- You had a son all these years.

1066
00:57:32,275 --> 00:57:33,862
- One I could love.

1067
00:57:33,862 --> 00:57:35,448
- You could have
 loved him anyway.

1068
00:57:35,448 --> 00:57:36,482
- Like you love yours, huh?

1069
00:57:36,482 --> 00:57:37,862
- [Audrey] Yes.

1070
00:57:37,862 --> 00:57:39,034
- Anyway?

1071
00:57:39,034 --> 00:57:41,000
You mean, in spite
 of what he is?

1072
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:41,965
That how you loved yours?

1073
00:57:41,965 --> 00:57:42,827
- Oh stop.

1074
00:57:42,827 --> 00:57:44,379
- Oh come on.

1075
00:57:44,379 --> 00:57:46,482
Get the hell out of here.

1076
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,103
- Look, why don't we
 just say good night,

1077
00:57:55,103 --> 00:57:57,896
and go to bed and
 get some sleep?

1078
00:57:57,896 --> 00:57:59,103
Let's face it, we're
 both wrung out,

1079
00:57:59,103 --> 00:58:01,448
it's been a long week today.

1080
00:58:02,689 --> 00:58:05,862
- It ain't been
 my usual Thursday.

1081
00:58:05,862 --> 00:58:07,586
- Mine either, honey.

1082
00:58:12,275 --> 00:58:14,862
[wind blowing]

1083
00:59:02,034 --> 00:59:03,862
- Testing, testing.

1084
00:59:03,862 --> 00:59:05,931
Mary had a little lamb.

1085
00:59:05,931 --> 00:59:08,586
[tape rewinding]

1086
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:11,034
- [Audrey] Sally,
 call Nettelston,

1087
00:59:11,034 --> 00:59:12,862
tell him not to
 finalize the deal yet.

1088
00:59:12,862 --> 00:59:15,206
It still doesn't
 sit right with me.

1089
00:59:15,206 --> 00:59:17,206
Call Phillip to check
 on the Hendrix stock,

1090
00:59:17,206 --> 00:59:18,413
it's making me nervous.

1091
00:59:18,413 --> 00:59:19,586
If you can't reach him--

1092
00:59:19,586 --> 00:59:21,448
- [Luanne] Testing, testing.

1093
00:59:21,448 --> 00:59:23,413
Mary had a little lamb.

1094
00:59:23,413 --> 00:59:26,655
[dramatic piano music]

1095
00:59:28,034 --> 00:59:29,586
Audrey?

1096
00:59:29,586 --> 00:59:31,517
This is me, Luanne.

1097
00:59:31,517 --> 00:59:34,344
This is to you
 that I can't do it.

1098
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,758
This is one of the stupidest
 things I ever done in my life,

1099
00:59:45,758 --> 00:59:48,586
and I've done
 entertaining things.

1100
00:59:50,068 --> 00:59:51,793
I don't know whatever
 come into my mind

1101
00:59:51,793 --> 00:59:54,034
to think I could do it,

1102
00:59:54,034 --> 00:59:55,724
after all this time.

1103
00:59:56,862 --> 01:00:00,448
What would I say to him,
after all this time?

1104
01:00:00,448 --> 01:00:01,379
- [Voice On Intercom] Final call

1105
01:00:01,379 --> 01:00:03,000
for flight 901 to Little Rock,

1106
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
boarding at gate number two.

1107
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,413
- [Audrey voiceover] I
 know no one will think

1108
01:00:06,413 --> 01:00:09,551
too highly of me for chickening
out at the last minute,

1109
01:00:09,551 --> 01:00:14,551
but no one else is in
 my shoes so [muffled].

1110
01:00:23,931 --> 01:00:26,689
I'll pay you back for the
 expenses you went through.

1111
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:28,241
It might take a while.

1112
01:00:28,241 --> 01:00:30,931
At least I'm paying
 my own way back.

1113
01:00:30,931 --> 01:00:33,413
I would have done that anyhow.

1114
01:00:36,586 --> 01:00:39,862
I'm sorry you went
 to so much trouble.

1115
01:00:39,862 --> 01:00:42,206
I don't blame you if
 you're really ticked off.

1116
01:00:42,206 --> 01:00:44,344
You really went to
 a lot of trouble.

1117
01:00:44,344 --> 01:00:46,448
You're a really good person,

1118
01:00:46,448 --> 01:00:47,758
but I wish I'd never
 laid eyes on you

1119
01:00:47,758 --> 01:00:49,724
if you know what I mean.

1120
01:00:51,724 --> 01:00:55,344
I hope your son's gonna
be okay, and have life.

1121
01:00:55,344 --> 01:00:57,310
Well, I guess that's all.

1122
01:01:32,517 --> 01:01:35,413
[doorbell ringing]

1123
01:01:45,931 --> 01:01:47,206
- I gotta do some shoppin'.

1124
01:01:47,206 --> 01:01:50,275
My clothes are flying
 to Little Rock.

1125
01:01:54,551 --> 01:01:55,344
- That,

1126
01:01:57,379 --> 01:01:58,206
or that?

1127
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:02,344
No.

1128
01:02:16,586 --> 01:02:17,413
Hi.

1129
01:02:20,551 --> 01:02:22,413
Luanne, this is my son, James.

1130
01:02:22,413 --> 01:02:24,827
James, Luanne Barnes.

1131
01:02:24,827 --> 01:02:25,931
- Hi.

1132
01:02:25,931 --> 01:02:26,758
- Hello.

1133
01:02:26,758 --> 01:02:28,517
Thank you for coming.

1134
01:02:33,862 --> 01:02:35,241
Would you care for some
coffee or anything?

1135
01:02:35,241 --> 01:02:36,586
We can go to the cafeteria.

1136
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:37,551
- I'm okay.

1137
01:02:37,551 --> 01:02:38,896
We had breakfast.

1138
01:02:38,896 --> 01:02:39,862
You?

1139
01:02:39,862 --> 01:02:40,758
- I'm fine.

1140
01:02:42,517 --> 01:02:44,758
Why don't we go on up then?

1141
01:02:59,379 --> 01:03:00,724
- Are you awake?

1142
01:03:02,241 --> 01:03:04,724
- The plane crashed,
there were no survivors.

1143
01:03:04,724 --> 01:03:07,931
I'm terribly sorry about Audrey.

1144
01:03:07,931 --> 01:03:09,000
- She's here.

1145
01:03:11,517 --> 01:03:14,034
- Can we discuss
 this for a few weeks?

1146
01:03:14,034 --> 01:03:16,206
- It's gonna be all right.

1147
01:03:17,551 --> 01:03:18,724
- Don't leave.

1148
01:03:20,551 --> 01:03:24,206
- You want to think
about that for a minute?

1149
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:47,896
[sad orchestral music]

1150
01:04:08,793 --> 01:04:11,551
- What's wrong
 with this picture?

1151
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:23,551
- How ya been, Donnie?

1152
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:29,586
I guess that's
 startin' out stupid.

1153
01:04:29,586 --> 01:04:33,586
- I've been fine prior
 to this current nuisance.

1154
01:04:35,793 --> 01:04:38,068
I like your outfit.

1155
01:04:38,068 --> 01:04:39,241
Tres chic, ma.

1156
01:04:40,344 --> 01:04:42,000
- You kiddin'? It's Audrey's.

1157
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,275
It's a long story.

1158
01:04:43,275 --> 01:04:46,655
Not that I don't have
some nice things myself.

1159
01:04:46,655 --> 01:04:48,931
But, it's too tight though.

1160
01:04:50,137 --> 01:04:52,310
I got to do some shoppin'.

1161
01:04:54,413 --> 01:04:57,379
- Would you like to sit down?

1162
01:04:57,379 --> 01:04:59,206
Or do you have to run?

1163
01:05:02,344 --> 01:05:03,344
I'm kidding.

1164
01:05:13,586 --> 01:05:14,862
- Been a while.

1165
01:05:16,344 --> 01:05:19,344
- You haven't changed a bit.

1166
01:05:19,344 --> 01:05:21,896
You're looking very well.

1167
01:05:21,896 --> 01:05:24,758
- Yeah well, don't
 let the hair fool ya.

1168
01:05:24,758 --> 01:05:25,827
It comes off.

1169
01:05:27,172 --> 01:05:28,931
- It's very becoming.

1170
01:05:31,448 --> 01:05:34,103
- You got no accent anymore.

1171
01:05:34,103 --> 01:05:34,965
- No.

1172
01:05:36,206 --> 01:05:38,758
- Well maybe a little
smidgen here and there.

1173
01:05:38,758 --> 01:05:40,655
You can hardly hear it.

1174
01:05:48,551 --> 01:05:51,517
Hear you got real successful?

1175
01:05:51,517 --> 01:05:53,931
- Yes, I've done pretty well.

1176
01:05:56,551 --> 01:05:59,068
Would you care for a chocolate?

1177
01:06:00,655 --> 01:06:01,655
- No thanks.

1178
01:06:08,206 --> 01:06:10,482
From drawing, more or less?

1179
01:06:11,344 --> 01:06:12,344
- I'm sorry.

1180
01:06:13,655 --> 01:06:17,379
- I mean you got successful
 just from drawing?

1181
01:06:19,172 --> 01:06:20,448
- More or less.

1182
01:06:25,827 --> 01:06:28,896
- You was always
 drawing as a kid.

1183
01:06:28,896 --> 01:06:32,551
Some kids draw and
 come to nothing but,

1184
01:06:32,551 --> 01:06:35,137
you was always real good at it.

1185
01:06:36,517 --> 01:06:39,068
- You taped them on the fridge.

1186
01:06:41,793 --> 01:06:42,620
- Yeah.

1187
01:06:52,448 --> 01:06:54,103
Can I smoke in here?

1188
01:06:57,896 --> 01:07:00,103
- He wants to go home.

1189
01:07:00,103 --> 01:07:02,275
- I thought the
 two of you agreed?

1190
01:07:02,275 --> 01:07:03,758
- He's reneged.

1191
01:07:03,758 --> 01:07:05,172
- Are you gonna let him?

1192
01:07:05,172 --> 01:07:06,689
- Yes.

1193
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:08,586
- Is that a good idea?

1194
01:07:08,586 --> 01:07:10,689
- It is for him.

1195
01:07:10,689 --> 01:07:11,827
In his place I'd
 want to be allowed

1196
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:14,000
to do what I wanted to do.

1197
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,310
[siren in the distance]

1198
01:07:26,137 --> 01:07:28,655
- I have to ask you something.

1199
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:33,965
Why haven't you been tested?

1200
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,103
- I don't want to.

1201
01:07:40,413 --> 01:07:42,000
- Is that wise?

1202
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,137
- Wisdom beyond my
 years I like to think.

1203
01:07:44,137 --> 01:07:45,344
- James?

1204
01:07:45,344 --> 01:07:48,586
- If I don't have it,
 it doesn't matter.

1205
01:07:50,724 --> 01:07:51,551
If I do,

1206
01:07:55,758 --> 01:07:56,724
and I said to you
 a few days ago,

1207
01:07:56,724 --> 01:07:59,068
we know what we want to know.

1208
01:07:59,068 --> 01:08:01,448
- That was about me.

1209
01:08:01,448 --> 01:08:03,000
- This is about me.

1210
01:08:07,206 --> 01:08:10,689
- Did they tell you
 you're in no danger?

1211
01:08:10,689 --> 01:08:12,275
James and Audrey?

1212
01:08:12,275 --> 01:08:13,793
- About what?

1213
01:08:13,793 --> 01:08:15,206
- Me.

1214
01:08:15,206 --> 01:08:16,034
This.

1215
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:20,793
- Yeah, they told me.

1216
01:08:20,793 --> 01:08:22,551
- Sure you don't,

1217
01:08:22,551 --> 01:08:23,379
really,

1218
01:08:25,275 --> 01:08:27,344
you can have a chocolate.

1219
01:08:28,586 --> 01:08:30,620
- This ain't easy
 for me, you know.

1220
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:32,862
I just want to be
 upfront about it.

1221
01:08:32,862 --> 01:08:34,206
- Thank you for coming.

1222
01:08:34,206 --> 01:08:35,034
- You mean it?

1223
01:08:35,034 --> 01:08:35,896
- Mean it.

1224
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:38,172
- I wasn't sure.

1225
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:42,103
All I've been thinking
 about since yesterday,

1226
01:08:42,103 --> 01:08:44,448
is if I wanted to come,

1227
01:08:44,448 --> 01:08:46,655
until this morning,
 I started wondering,

1228
01:08:46,655 --> 01:08:49,034
what your position
 was on the situation.

1229
01:08:49,034 --> 01:08:51,586
- That's my position.

1230
01:08:51,586 --> 01:08:53,482
- I'm sorry what
happened to you, Donnie.

1231
01:08:53,482 --> 01:08:55,034
- We said soon is mended.

1232
01:08:55,034 --> 01:08:59,103
- But you brought it on
yourself, didn't you?

1233
01:08:59,103 --> 01:09:00,000
Didn't you?

1234
01:09:02,103 --> 01:09:02,965
I'm sorry.

1235
01:09:02,965 --> 01:09:04,517
I didn't mean to shout.

1236
01:09:04,517 --> 01:09:05,931
It just come out.

1237
01:09:13,206 --> 01:09:14,620
- Arms restored,

1238
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:16,965
these are such trying times.

1239
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:21,758
- Is someone smoking in here?

1240
01:09:22,896 --> 01:09:26,068
- To whose health
 would it be hazardous?

1241
01:09:32,689 --> 01:09:35,103
How do you like Audrey?

1242
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:37,689
- Boy, she's something
 else isn't she?

1243
01:09:37,689 --> 01:09:39,862
You know she's got me
 staying at her house?

1244
01:09:39,862 --> 01:09:41,103
Did you know that?

1245
01:09:41,103 --> 01:09:42,724
- That's very nice.

1246
01:09:45,379 --> 01:09:48,103
- You know she said that

1247
01:09:48,103 --> 01:09:51,000
what do you say,
you designed it?

1248
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,482
It's real nice.

1249
01:09:52,482 --> 01:09:53,310
Real nice.

1250
01:09:56,965 --> 01:09:59,000
You know what I'd love to do?

1251
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,275
I would really love

1252
01:10:01,275 --> 01:10:04,620
to take a swim in
 her swimming pool.

1253
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:07,896
Doesn't anybody ever
 swim in them pools?

1254
01:10:07,896 --> 01:10:09,034
You know, in the movies,

1255
01:10:09,034 --> 01:10:11,620
nobody ever swims in them.

1256
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:13,206
They're just there.

1257
01:10:14,758 --> 01:10:16,586
- Take the plunge, ma.

1258
01:10:22,275 --> 01:10:25,551
- There's something
 I want to show you.

1259
01:10:37,034 --> 01:10:38,172
Remember this?

1260
01:10:50,103 --> 01:10:52,655
Remember when you drew that up?

1261
01:10:53,862 --> 01:10:57,482
You was about, I don't
 know, eight or nine.

1262
01:10:57,482 --> 01:11:01,862
You said you was gonna
 build that for me, some day.

1263
01:11:01,862 --> 01:11:02,689
For us.

1264
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:05,862
A magic castle.

1265
01:11:08,344 --> 01:11:11,793
And we'd live in it
 together, you and me.

1266
01:11:16,448 --> 01:11:18,965
And it would be full of magic.

1267
01:11:27,206 --> 01:11:29,310
Your son's real good-lookin'.

1268
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:30,655
- Yes, isn't he?

1269
01:11:32,068 --> 01:11:33,241
- Could have really been
 something with the ladies,

1270
01:11:33,241 --> 01:11:34,241
couldn't he?

1271
01:11:35,448 --> 01:11:39,068
His father must have
 been real handsome.

1272
01:11:39,068 --> 01:11:40,551
Oh I mean, I didn't
 mean it that way,

1273
01:11:40,551 --> 01:11:42,862
I mean that you are a
very good-lookin' woman.

1274
01:11:42,862 --> 01:11:45,379
- His father was a real looker.

1275
01:11:47,206 --> 01:11:49,896
- You got a boyfriend?

1276
01:11:49,896 --> 01:11:51,310
- No.

1277
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:53,827
- Me neither, lately.

1278
01:11:53,827 --> 01:11:55,620
It's a bitch ain't it?

1279
01:11:59,379 --> 01:12:02,000
- How did it go with Donald?

1280
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,310
- I hardly recognized him.

1281
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:06,965
He never was too
 hardy, built-wise.

1282
01:12:06,965 --> 01:12:09,620
Took more after me
 than his old man.

1283
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:12,655
Freddy was a real big fella.

1284
01:12:12,655 --> 01:12:16,758
Of course, he didn't believe
 that he was his old man.

1285
01:12:16,758 --> 01:12:17,689
- Donald didn't?

1286
01:12:17,689 --> 01:12:19,344
- No, Freddy.

1287
01:12:19,344 --> 01:12:21,862
Didn't believe
 Donnie was his son.

1288
01:12:21,862 --> 01:12:24,517
Said there was no way
 that any son of his,

1289
01:12:24,517 --> 01:12:26,241
could be one of them.

1290
01:12:27,551 --> 01:12:29,000
- That's insane.

1291
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,620
- Yeah, well even I knew
 that was a bit far-fetched.

1292
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:34,551
Still in all, I sure
 didn't like having to take

1293
01:12:34,551 --> 01:12:37,413
a rap like that on
 account of Donnie.

1294
01:12:37,413 --> 01:12:39,034
There's one thing nobody can say

1295
01:12:39,034 --> 01:12:41,827
about me is I fooled around.

1296
01:12:41,827 --> 01:12:44,275
I'd take 'em as they come,
 but I take 'em one at a time.

1297
01:12:44,275 --> 01:12:46,068
- You didn't take a rap
on account of Donnie,

1298
01:12:46,068 --> 01:12:47,862
you took it on account
 of your husband.

1299
01:12:47,862 --> 01:12:49,413
- Ah, either way.

1300
01:12:49,413 --> 01:12:50,724
- No, it isn't either way.

1301
01:12:50,724 --> 01:12:52,689
Don't you understand
 the difference?

1302
01:12:52,689 --> 01:12:56,758
- I sure do tend to get you
 all stressed out, don't I?

1303
01:12:56,758 --> 01:12:58,758
- Tell me what you want to do.

1304
01:12:58,758 --> 01:13:00,000
- In regards to what?

1305
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,344
- Are you gonna go
right back to Arkansas,

1306
01:13:01,344 --> 01:13:03,172
or are you gonna stay?

1307
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,068
- How did she seem after?

1308
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:10,241
- I suspect a quickened pulse,

1309
01:13:10,241 --> 01:13:11,620
plus a cardiac tremor maybe,

1310
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,275
but she seemed
 steady on her feet.

1311
01:13:13,275 --> 01:13:16,965
She didn't rush to the
 ladies for a quick upchuck.

1312
01:13:16,965 --> 01:13:19,655
- She wouldn't
 touch me, you know.

1313
01:13:19,655 --> 01:13:20,655
- Of course.

1314
01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:25,172
- Will she stay do you think?

1315
01:13:25,172 --> 01:13:26,413
Do you know?

1316
01:13:26,413 --> 01:13:28,379
- I don't know yet.

1317
01:13:28,379 --> 01:13:29,965
Do you want her to?

1318
01:13:33,827 --> 01:13:34,655
Sorry.

1319
01:13:46,724 --> 01:13:49,448
[James laughing]

1320
01:13:55,034 --> 01:13:58,000
- Prices are very reasonable,
 they have sales all the time.

1321
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,965
- I don't need a whole lot.

1322
01:13:59,965 --> 01:14:01,482
- I have to go to the office.

1323
01:14:01,482 --> 01:14:04,862
I'll see you back at
 the house around six?

1324
01:14:04,862 --> 01:14:07,586
- He's really
 gonna die isn't he?

1325
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:16,758
[somber orchestral music]

1326
01:14:40,517 --> 01:14:41,758
- That's a pretty outfit.

1327
01:14:41,758 --> 01:14:43,827
- Yeah, real California.

1328
01:14:43,827 --> 01:14:46,862
It'll knock 'em over
 back in Fayetteville.

1329
01:14:46,862 --> 01:14:48,724
- What will you tell
them when you get back?

1330
01:14:48,724 --> 01:14:49,758
Your friends?

1331
01:14:49,758 --> 01:14:51,000
- About what?

1332
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,758
- Where you've been, why.

1333
01:14:53,758 --> 01:14:55,896
- I ain't got to that yet.

1334
01:14:57,137 --> 01:14:59,103
- Maybe you'll tell
 them the truth.

1335
01:14:59,103 --> 01:15:01,137
- I ain't got to that yet, okay?

1336
01:15:01,137 --> 01:15:02,827
What's the difference
to you what I tell them?

1337
01:15:02,827 --> 01:15:03,655
- Here.

1338
01:15:14,275 --> 01:15:16,068
I think I owe you something.

1339
01:15:16,068 --> 01:15:17,827
- What would that be?

1340
01:15:19,241 --> 01:15:22,758
- A few days ago when I was
 first told Donald was ill,

1341
01:15:22,758 --> 01:15:25,068
I didn't really
 know much about him.

1342
01:15:25,068 --> 01:15:27,137
I've known him for
 four years but,

1343
01:15:27,137 --> 01:15:29,793
I didn't know anything about
 him that really mattered.

1344
01:15:29,793 --> 01:15:32,551
I didn't know about you, I
 didn't know you even existed.

1345
01:15:32,551 --> 01:15:35,241
I didn't know where he was from.

1346
01:15:35,241 --> 01:15:36,310
The truth is,

1347
01:15:37,517 --> 01:15:38,862
if the person my son
 had been living with

1348
01:15:38,862 --> 01:15:41,517
for the past four
 years had breasts,

1349
01:15:41,517 --> 01:15:44,655
I'd have known her entire life
 history in about one hour,

1350
01:15:44,655 --> 01:15:46,758
because I'd have
 wanted to know it.

1351
01:15:46,758 --> 01:15:48,448
- Yeah, well I kind of
figured you were coming

1352
01:15:48,448 --> 01:15:51,620
from a couple of
 different directions.

1353
01:15:53,724 --> 01:15:55,724
- That's what I owe you.

1354
01:15:58,482 --> 01:16:01,793
You know how you're always
 calling Donald one of them?

1355
01:16:01,793 --> 01:16:03,827
There was something that
bugged me about it, every time,

1356
01:16:03,827 --> 01:16:07,034
and I couldn't quite
 put my finger on it.

1357
01:16:07,034 --> 01:16:09,034
Then I realized what it is.

1358
01:16:09,034 --> 01:16:12,103
Those are the words that have
 caused so much pain and fear,

1359
01:16:12,103 --> 01:16:15,206
for so many, in so
 many ways, always.

1360
01:16:16,379 --> 01:16:17,379
One of them.

1361
01:16:18,827 --> 01:16:20,413
Those are the words that all
 the other words are about,

1362
01:16:20,413 --> 01:16:21,310
ugly words.

1363
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:25,862
Your son isn't one of them.

1364
01:16:25,862 --> 01:16:27,931
My son isn't one of them.

1365
01:16:30,137 --> 01:16:32,034
Our sons our two of us.

1366
01:16:40,241 --> 01:16:43,344
It's been an interesting
couple of days.

1367
01:16:43,344 --> 01:16:45,931
I almost started smoking again.

1368
01:16:45,931 --> 01:16:46,862
- Well it's a wonder
 you didn't resort

1369
01:16:46,862 --> 01:16:49,137
to controlled substances.

1370
01:16:49,137 --> 01:16:52,448
Luanne and you, the mind
can't quite grasp it.

1371
01:16:52,448 --> 01:16:54,620
- She's a smart lady,

1372
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:57,068
in a rather irritating way.

1373
01:16:57,068 --> 01:16:58,689
- Why irritating?

1374
01:16:58,689 --> 01:17:01,517
- She doesn't know she's smart.

1375
01:17:01,517 --> 01:17:03,172
Smarter than me.

1376
01:17:03,172 --> 01:17:05,241
- Oh, but you know you're smart?

1377
01:17:05,241 --> 01:17:08,000
- Behind a desk with a computer.

1378
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:08,862
- Why not?

1379
01:17:11,655 --> 01:17:14,172
- She's terrible about Donald.

1380
01:17:14,172 --> 01:17:17,034
There were times I could
have strangled her.

1381
01:17:17,034 --> 01:17:18,172
- The Luanne
 Barneses in our midst

1382
01:17:18,172 --> 01:17:20,172
are best not taken seriously,

1383
01:17:20,172 --> 01:17:21,655
unless of course, one encounters
them in a lonely place

1384
01:17:21,655 --> 01:17:23,896
coming at you with
 a baseball bat.

1385
01:17:23,896 --> 01:17:26,482
- Well she's nothing like
 that bad, give her a break.

1386
01:17:26,482 --> 01:17:28,206
- I gather you are.

1387
01:17:28,206 --> 01:17:32,724
- She's right up front, what
 you see is what you get.

1388
01:17:32,724 --> 01:17:35,137
And I'd rather get what I
 see anytime, wouldn't you?

1389
01:17:35,137 --> 01:17:36,862
Beats deceit.

1390
01:17:36,862 --> 01:17:38,068
It beats lying.

1391
01:17:39,724 --> 01:17:41,448
It beats tap dancing.

1392
01:17:43,275 --> 01:17:44,344
- Hands down.

1393
01:17:50,206 --> 01:17:52,137
- What would you think,

1394
01:17:53,241 --> 01:17:55,068
if I told you I was devastated

1395
01:17:55,068 --> 01:17:57,965
when I first realized
 you were gay?

1396
01:18:00,413 --> 01:18:01,758
- I'd think you might be
 turning in your tap shoes

1397
01:18:01,758 --> 01:18:04,482
for a sturdier
 style in footwear.

1398
01:18:06,275 --> 01:18:09,724
- I never have really been
 able to get it together since.

1399
01:18:09,724 --> 01:18:10,655
That's what you
 meant the other day,

1400
01:18:10,655 --> 01:18:13,000
the mountains under the rug?

1401
01:18:16,413 --> 01:18:18,689
The woman of the world,

1402
01:18:18,689 --> 01:18:20,241
taking it all in stride

1403
01:18:20,241 --> 01:18:23,620
and falling flat on my face
 when no one was looking.

1404
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:26,482
- Sometimes when they work.

1405
01:18:26,482 --> 01:18:28,206
- It showed, huh?

1406
01:18:28,206 --> 01:18:30,793
- Now and again, yeah.

1407
01:18:30,793 --> 01:18:33,275
- That's very embarrassing.

1408
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:34,344
- You did the best you could

1409
01:18:34,344 --> 01:18:37,000
with what you had to do it with.

1410
01:18:38,724 --> 01:18:41,551
Centuries of rules
 and revulsions.

1411
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:49,344
