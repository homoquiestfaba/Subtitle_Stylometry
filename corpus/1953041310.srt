1
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,480
man: Wake the hell up!

2
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,020
You're gonna be late,
doofus.

3
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,340
Sis?

4
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,300
Oh, there you are.

5
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,630
Get your lazy ass goin'.

6
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,870
You're gonna miss
the cheese wagon.

7
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,270
And, no, you can't borrow
my BMX.

8
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,070
It's got a flat.

9
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,240
Jesus, kiddo.

10
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,650
You've seen that movie
damn near 50 times.

11
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,410
You're gonna
wear out the VHS.

12
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,650
Go on.

13
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,690
( school bell ringing )

14
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,430
girl: This is my life.

15
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,060
I'm a 14-year-old girl.

16
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,730
Or... actually,
a hybrid..

17
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,170
girl and boy.

18
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,330
When my mother was alive,

19
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,280
she told me
I was a hermaphrodite.

20
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,580
But my brother just always
called me...

21
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,550
Spork!

22
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,420
( children laughing )

23
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,700
( toilet flushing )

24
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,490
Hey.

25
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,250
The name's Chunk.

26
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,590
Kind of like "chink," but
instead they call me Chunk.

27
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,590
Hi.

28
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,890
My... my name's Spork.

29
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,900
So, Spork, why are you cRyin'
like a little bitch?

30
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,660
Because I'm sick
of being me.

31
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,300
Hey, fuck that shit, man.

32
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,900
Next time
somebody bothers you,

33
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,600
all you gotta do is
close your eyes

34
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,580
and think of something happy.

35
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,580
# Spork and Chunk
sittin' in a tree #

36
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,340
# E-A-T-I-- ##

37
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,220
( giggling )

38
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,400
That's...

39
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,440
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, my gosh!

40
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,800
That is terrible.

41
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,310
I think I can see her
ding-a-ling through her shoRts.

42
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,870
( laughing )

43
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,980
Seriously.

44
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,950
Just close your eyes and think
of some happy shit.

45
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,220
Wow.

46
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,990
( gasping )

47
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,860
... basketball.

48
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,060
Oh, I did not...

49
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,430
( whispering )

50
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,100
She went on
a psychopathic rage.

51
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,370
Nobody even knows
why she did it.

52
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,070
Nobody even
knows where she lives.

53
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,010
I think she's emo, or she,
like, she's crazy.

54
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,570
And maybe she'll...

55
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,720
( rock music playing )

56
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,520
Hey, Spork.

57
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,860
Proud of you today.

58
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,260
School, I mean.

59
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,700
Don't take shit
from people like that.

60
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,270
Oh, yeah,
I fixed my BMX, too.

61
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,830
So take that to
school now.

62
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,510
See, Buster?

63
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,250
Things are already
staRting to change.

64
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,720
Oh, are you hungRy?

65
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,790
( phone ringing )

66
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,900
Hello?

67
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,370
Hella-hella-hello, girl!

68
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,800
Oh, hey, Tootsie Roll.

69
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,470
I heard about your little
run-in with Betsy Byotch.

70
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,410
Mmm!

71
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,270
Can I just say damn!

72
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,340
I'm so proud of you.

73
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,310
And you
got off scot-free.

74
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,580
I don't know, that big brother
of yours is mad fly.

75
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,020
Principal Tulip.

76
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,250
Spit.

77
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,050
"Anyhoo," I'm proud
of you, okay?

78
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,960
About time you
grew a pair of balls.

79
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,360
Oh, uh...

80
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,900
You know what
I mean, girl.

81
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:56,940
So, listen up.

82
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,870
The school dance-off
is comin' up,

83
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,910
and "yous" knows
I'm all up in that.

84
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,170
Better come this year
and cheer me on.

85
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,010
Hey!

86
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,600
I don't know, Tootsie Roll.

87
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,270
I've never really been
to a school dance or--

88
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,750
or dance-off thingy.

89
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,690
Spork, we're
1 4 years old now.

90
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,090
About time you grow up and stop
playin' with them little,

91
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,590
you know, bonk-ass
toys and get out more.

92
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,180
Damn.

93
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,790
How do you know what I do?

94
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,270
'Cause I live right
next door to you, ho!

95
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,360
"Anyhoo," I need to win
this dance, okay?

96
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,670
'Cause it be
a cash prize of $236.

97
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,970
Oh!

98
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,630
Wait.

99
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,940
Why $236?

100
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,880
Why not 250--

101
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:42,810
I don't know!

102
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,750
The point is,
with that bling,

103
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,880
I could go see my daddy at
the CherRy Lane PenitentiaRy.

104
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,980
Oh, my mama ain't never
gonna take me.

105
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,550
And I know he'd be happy
as hell to see me up in there.

106
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,750
Girl!

107
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,990
You really think you'll win?

108
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,430
Spork, ain't nobody can
shake their shit in a can

109
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,560
Iike Tootsie Roll, okay?

110
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,030
Shake their what?

111
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,900
So we fittin' to go
and "cele-brizzate"

112
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,170
your victoRy or what?

113
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,400
I don't know.

114
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,410
I mean, I... I still have
some homework to do.

115
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,670
Bitch, please!

116
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,240
Homework can wait, okay?

117
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,680
You kicked a girl's ass today
for the first time.

118
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,010
I'm comin' by after
eight-o-clocky-clock

119
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,480
and pick you up
on my bike.

120
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,180
I just got pegs.

121
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,190
And this Afro Sheen
is off the hook.

122
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,780
Mm-hmm, make my hair
all shiny and shit.

123
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,490
Okay, later, ho.

124
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,030
Ahh!

125
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,790
Oh, yeah, girl!

126
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,440
( knocking )

127
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,270
Oh, my God.

128
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,310
Oh, my God.

129
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,750
You can't even tell.

130
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,910
I am going to chop off that
bitch's little pecker

131
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,420
the next
time I see her.

132
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,550
Chill out, drama-rama.

133
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,680
At least now you have an excuse
to get a nose job.

134
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,950
I never
wanted a nose job!

135
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,390
"Whatev."

136
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,360
You know what I mean.

137
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,330
I am cereal,
Loosie Goosie!

138
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,560
I have to get her back
somehow.

139
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,470
I am Betsy Byotch!

140
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,870
Nobody gets away
with this.

141
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,530
Even if she is a gimp.

142
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,010
Well, why don't you pants her
in front of the whole school?

143
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,010
That'll upset her.

144
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,870
I could,
but that's not mean enough.

145
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,810
I mean, who cares about her
fucking wee-wee, okay?

146
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,350
I need to
scar her for life.

147
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,820
Like she did moi!

148
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,820
Just wait 'til
I think of something.

149
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,520
She is gonna get it.

150
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,850
( thundering )

151
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,790
Oh, wow, J.Lo used to be a
dancer on "In Living Color"?

152
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,990
So ghetto.

153
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,630
Hey, Spork.

154
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,370
You plannin' on
going somewhere?

155
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,380
Tootsie Roll's gonna take me out
to some place called

156
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,000
Booty Ballroom.

157
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,980
Oh, yeah.

158
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,280
That's a pretty cool shindig,

159
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,750
I mean, if you're
a coal miner at least.

160
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,610
I never hooked up with
no black chick.

161
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,920
Well, don't be
home too late, kiddo.

162
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,620
It's a school night.

163
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,750
Hey.

164
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,020
Spit.

165
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,500
Candice just told me
she's pregnant.

166
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,590
Is it yours, you big idiot?

167
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,540
Does a chicken
have a pecker?

168
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,130
Goddamn it, man, again?

169
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,980
Goddamn it.

170
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,040
Ooh!

171
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,610
Girl, you gotta tell
that hick of a brother of yours

172
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,490
to take a shower.

173
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,720
Damn!

174
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,850
I don't have
anything cool to wear.

175
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,190
Maybe I should just
stay home.

176
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,920
Oh, no, uh-uh.

177
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,560
Let Tootsie Roll
have a look at you.

178
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,610
Girl, you're gonna take all
the attention away from me.

179
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,170
But it is
your night.

180
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,440
Come on, let's go.

181
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,920
( dance music playing
in distance )

182
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,350
Hey, hey!

183
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,350
Oh!

184
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,680
You must be trippin'.

185
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,910
Oh, oh, no.

186
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,980
Twix, this is
a big day for Spork,

187
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,550
and I'm fittin' to show her how
to break it off tonight.

188
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,990
Now move out of my way,
or I'm gonna tell Mama!

189
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,860
( dance music playing )

190
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,780
All right, let me get two
Yoo-hoos, LarRy.

191
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,350
Are you sure
they came in here?

192
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,220
Don't question my logic,
Loosie Goosie.

193
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,810
( dance music playing )

194
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,410
Oh, no.

195
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,450
Oh, no, she stole
that move from me.

196
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,520
Hey, Tootsie Roll,
want to give it a go?

197
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,520
Huh.

198
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:17,080
Oh, now you all up on me
like we friends?

199
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,280
Let me show you how you're
supposed to break it down.

200
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,160
Ho!

201
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,220
Move out of my way.

202
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,520
Clear the dance floor, hos.

203
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,720
Come on, chocolate.

204
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,160
Move back, chocolate.

205
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,360
Oh, y'all know
the regular.

206
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,370
Back it up more,
back it up more.

207
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,560
Okay.

208
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,260
All right, come on,
play that track, Deejay.

209
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,770
The butterfly
uh-uh that's old

210
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,140
Let me see the Tootsie Roll

211
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,980

212
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,410
69 Boyz backed up by

213
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,280
- The Quad City D.J.
- Move, ho!

214
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,510
One time cotton candy
sweet to go

215
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,020
Let me see

216
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,580
Come on, come on

217
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,650

218
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,120
Here we go, here we go
Tootsie Roll

219
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,160
Just make that
Tootsie Roll

220
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,700
Yeah Tootsie Roll

221
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,790
Let me see that
Tootsie Roll

222
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,390
Get off the floor
Tootsie Roll

223
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,730
And make that
Tootsie Roll

224
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,240
To the left, to the left

225
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,030
To the right

00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,340
Slide, slide

227
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,010
To the left, to the left

228
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,110
To the right...

229
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,670
Can I make
a request, please?

230
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,450
... to the front to
the back, to the back

231
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,460
Now dip baby come on now
dip baby

232
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,960
( dance music playing )

233
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,560
( record scratching )

234
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,800
( laughing )

235
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,070
I am gonna get that Spork!

236
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,200
Her little
colored friend too.

237
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,440
- What, bitch?
- What, bitch?

238
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,010
Ahh!

239
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,250
Hey!

240
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,150
# It's peRfect #

# The... bass #

253
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,320
# The bass, the bass #

254
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,480
# It's just
the bass, the bass #

255
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,190
# The bass #

00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,490
# It's just the bass

257
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,530
# Bass, bass #

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,190
# Like, like, like

259
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,700
# Bass, bass, bass #

260
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,640
# You, you, you
you like the bass #

261
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,470
# Bass, bass #

262
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,740
# Hey #

263
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,840
# You're in the streets

264
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,710
# 'Cause you need that ooh #

265
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,580
# The room goes round
spinning round #

266
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,380
# When you drink that ooh #

267
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,650
# You get kicked out

268
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,280
# 'Cause you're rowdy
when you hear that #

269
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,080
# And you love that #

270
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,380
# You just can't
stop that ##

271
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,860
SorRy.

272
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,400
I'm...

273
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,070
I-- I-- I-- I was just--
just looking at, um...

274
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,130
My tits?

275
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,410
No... I wasn't.

276
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,580
I was-- I-- I was just
looking at your necklace.

277
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,950
It's-- it's really--
it's really pretty.

278
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,790
It... Iooks expensive.

279
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,920
Where'd you get it?

280
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,680
I found it.

281
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,950
Why?

282
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,490
Then why do you wear it?

283
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,960
'Cause, kiddo...

284
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:24,690
people need to...

285
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,290
feel like they belong to
something in their lives.

286
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,860
You know?

287
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,460
Something bigger than
themselves.

288
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:35,940
Follow the rules
'cause their parents did.

289
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:39,500
Be told what to do,
what to believe.

290
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,770
Shit like that, you know?

291
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,610
Basically I wear it so...

292
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,420
I'll fit the fuck in
with eveRybody else.

293
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,580
So...

294
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,680
if I wear one,
then I'll belong, too?

295
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,090
I don't see why the fuck not.

296
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,490
Welcome,
my little stray lamb.

297
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,330
Welcome to salvation.

298
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,810
Today is the last day of your
sinner-life

299
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,170
and the first day of
your new life with Christ,

300
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,810
your Lord and Savior.

301
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,040
So, um, if--

302
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,450
if I join,
I'll belong with you guys?

303
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,650
( giggling )

304
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,780
Of course, silly.

305
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,480
You'll be my sister
in Christ.

306
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,180
Oh, it's so much fun!

307
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,990
And you'll soon learn
that together

308
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,220
we can spread Christ's
love to eveRyone we meet

309
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,820
and bring them to
salvation.

310
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,890
Together.

311
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,400
You-- you--
you really mean it?

312
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,530
Shh now.

313
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,470
I'm not gonna huRt you.

314
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,200
I'm your friend.

315
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,340
What's your name, sweetie?

316
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:49,040
Sp... Spork.

317
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,850
Well, a-a-actually,
it's more of a nickname.

318
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,720
Hmm.

319
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,080
That's an interesting name.

320
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,380
Why do they
call you that?

321
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,760
( laughing )

322
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,890
What?

323
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,460
Well, "Spark," or...

324
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,970
whatever.

325
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,010
I really don't
think someone like you

326
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:18,200
would make a veRy good addition
to God's army of goodness.

327
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,680
I mean, really now.

328
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,180
God made man
in his own image,

329
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,610
and I highly doubt that
includes you,

330
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,950
my dear, sweet harlot.

331
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,080
So...

332
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,620
Shut up!

333
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,570
SorRy, Spork.

334
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:57,210
Just tRying see
if I could cop a feel.

335
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,610
Please don't touch me.

336
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,020
( children laughing )

337
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,220
That's enough.

338
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,480
You brats!

339
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,150
Now show some "ratitude."

340
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,160
There will be a test
later on this week.

341
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:15,000
And none of you
can afford to fail.

342
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,500
All right.

343
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,470
Now this here is the uterus,

344
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,870
in which the fetal canal carries
a child upon biRth.

345
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,270
( sighing )

346
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,610
Can anyone tell me what we
learned in chapter one

347
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,270
about another
way to give biRth?

348
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,580
Yeah, from your ass.

349
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,080
( children laughing )

350
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,980
Maybe yours,
you little faiRy.

351
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,020
No.

352
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,320
Actually, there has never been
a case in which one was born

353
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,060
out of another's anus.

354
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:48,000
In any event,
the male reproductive organs

355
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:53,200
play just as impoRtant a role
as the female's.

356
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,400
ObseRve.

357
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:59,770
Here we have the penis.

358
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,410
Within the penis
is the urethra.

359
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,380
It's also...

360
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,780
( school bell ringing )

361
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,090
Hey, Spork.

362
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,360
You know, you shouldn't
be upset.

363
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,660
I mean, trust me.

364
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,170
People always knock me
because I have two gay dads.

365
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:57,000
Like, screw them, man.

366
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,200
I'm proud of
my gay parents.

367
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,200
And you should be proud of
being a lesbian.

368
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,140
I'm not a lesbian, Charlie.

369
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,570
Well, whatever you
wanna call it then.

370
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,770
Confused.

371
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,010
I'm not confused either,
Charlie.

372
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,880
Just because you're gay,
doesn't mean eveRybody else is.

373
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,380
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

374
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,420
What?

375
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,950
I said my dads are gay.

376
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,580
I'm not a fuckin'
faggot.

377
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,550
Aw!

378
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,350
Screw you, you mutant.

379
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,020
Watch it, homo.

380
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,460
Look out, ho!

381
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,520
Ooh.

382
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,400
My bad, girl.

383
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,030
I didn't even see you.

384
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,900
Listen, me and my hos are gonna
practice a little booty shakin'.

385
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:35,960
Why don't you come with us?

386
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,570
I know you ain't
gonna let this white girl

387
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,630
come with us to practice.

388
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,770
You know whiteys
ain't allowed to pop it.

389
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:44,320
Bitch, silence that hole,
and respect my girl.

390
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,440
Okay?

391
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,150
She is my neighbor,
and I got her back.

392
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:47,880
Hear that?

393
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,920
Mmm, come on, let's go.

394
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,790
Come on, Spork.

395
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,480
# Ding-ding-ding-a-ling #

396
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,960
# Ding-a-ling #

397
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,790
Spork, let's go!

398
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,160
# Ding-a-ling #

399
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,200
# Ding-ding-ding-a-ling #

400
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,600
# Ding-a-ling #

401
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,530
# Shake your
ding-a-ling #

402
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,830
# Ding-a-ling #

403
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,870
# Shake your
ding-a-ling #

404
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,200
# Ding-a-ling #

405
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,330
# Shake your
ding-a-ling #

406
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,670
# Ding-a-ling #

407
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,510
# Ding-ding-ding-a-ling #

408
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,810
# Hey little thing #

409
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,970
# Shake that
ding-a-ling #

410
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,240
# Shake, shake it just
don't break it #

411
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,010
# Hey little thing
shake that ding-a-ling #

412
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,680
# Don't fake it move 'til you
make it #

413
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,620
# Hey little thing
shake that ding-a-ling #

414
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:22,920
# Shake, shake it just
don't break it #

415
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,850
# Hey little thing
shake that ding-a-ling #

416
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,860
# D-d-ding-a-ling #

417
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:27,980
# Now left... #

418
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,290
The butterfly
uh-uh that's old

419
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,030
Let me see the Tootsie Roll

420
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,570
Yeah 1994

421
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,830
69 Boyz backed up by
the Quad City D.J.

422
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,140
One time cotton candy
sweet to go

423
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,680
Let me see that Tootsie Roll

424
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,230
Come on, come on
Tootsie Roll

425
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,250
Just make
that Tootsie Roll

426
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,650
Here we go Tootsie Roll

427
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,810
Just make that
Tootsie Roll

428
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,550
Yeah Tootsie Roll

429
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,520
Let me see that
Tootsie Roll

430
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,890
Tootsie Roll

431
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,550
Make that Tootsie Roll

432
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,020
To the left, to the left

433
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,720
To the right
to the right

434
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,560
To the front, to the front

435
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,030
To the back
to the back

436
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,430
Don't be-- Oh!

437
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,400
Girl, you're gonna have to
turn your head that way.

438
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:11,660
... Just slide baby slide
just slide baby slide

439
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,700
Come on, come on

440
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,260
To the left, to the left

441
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,140
To the right...

442
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,470
Oh, shit, oh!

443
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,270
Damn!

444
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:22,010
That shit must've "huRted"
for "reals."

445
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:22,980
You okay?

446
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,540
Ouch.

447
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:29,190
Ow, ow, damn.

448
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,120
Ow, watch it, Spork.

449
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,420
Damn, you know my shit is
busted.

450
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,760
I-- I-- I'm sorRy.

451
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,460
Why you sorRy?

452
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,620
It was my damn fault I didn't
rinse all that Afro Sheen

453
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,560
before I went
and acted a fool.

454
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:53,040
You were amazing,
by the way.

455
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:57,280
I mean...
the way you dance, it--

456
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:01,220
It was like no other kind of
dancing I've ever seen.

457
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,920
Does it huRt?

458
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,330
Not like this.

459
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,760
Usually it's like...

460
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:19,100
it's like I'm not
Tootsie Roll no more.

461
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:22,040
Like I'm some other
person...

462
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:25,240
doing my thing.

463
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:28,510
Somewhere far, far away
from this shithole.

464
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:34,410
And I can be
anybody I wanna be.

465
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,650
You know?

466
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,320
"Anyhoo," I'm over this shit.

467
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,690
I don't wanna
see my daddy no way.

468
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,490
He's probably busy and all
tRying to hold down the Bloods.

469
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,830
He's their leader
on the inside.

470
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,960
- You know?
- Wow.

471
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,730
He sounds impoRtant.

472
00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:00,110
Well, what-- what if--
what if one of your friends

473
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,310
could do the dance-off
for you...

474
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,440
and give you the money?

475
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:09,080
Girl, what kind of world
is you livin' in?

476
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,090
Ain't no girls of mine
gonna give me no money

477
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,820
to see my daddy.

478
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:16,220
They got
their own dreams.

479
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,290
But-- but, I mean, if they're
your real friends--

480
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,890
I got no real friends, okay?

481
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:21,900
None of us do.

482
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,800
That's the way
it is in the hood.

483
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,530
You know that.

484
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,070
You live here, too.

485
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,770
I mean, Spork, who you know that
would do that for you, girl?

486
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:39,010
I don't know.

487
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,210
No one, I guess.

488
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,430
Ooh, girl.

489
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,490
You just saw
a shooting star.

490
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,000
Make a wish, Spork.

491
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,160
Damn, I hope you made a wish
for both of us.

492
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,140
'Cause I'm definitely
getting up outta here

493
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,640
when I'm all grown-up like.

494
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,740
Girl, get your ghetto broke ass
in this house right now.

495
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,510
It's way past
your bedtime.

496
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,190
All right, I gotta bounce.

497
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,880
Thanks for
helping me home, Spork.

498
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,120
No problem.

499
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,250
I'm right next door
if you need me.

500
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,060
Yeah, okay.

501
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,990
Later, chickenhead.

502
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,590
You keep playing
with that he-boy-she-boy,

503
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,060
you're gonna fuck around
and grow a ding-a-ling.

504
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,430
Get in here.

505
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,560
- What's wrong with you?
- Mom!

506
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,630
Shut up, damn!

507
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,070
I read that on TV,
I read it on TV!

508
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:45,180
Spork: This is
where my mommy sleeps.

509
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,880
Spit didn't have any money to
buRy her proper-like,

510
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:50,620
so we put her back here

511
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:53,890
until we get some
money to do it right.

512
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,050
When our dog Buster died,

513
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,960
Spit tried to
throw him in the garbage,

514
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,430
but I pulled him out
and kept him.

515
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,160
Spit said he
doesn't care neither way,

516
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,930
'cause Buster was
better off dead

517
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,560
and Mom was just a stupid whore
who left us like daddy did.

518
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,370
But... sometimes
I hear Spit late at night,

519
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:16,740
coming out here and
talking to her.

520
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,840
I even heard him cRy once,

521
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,480
though he'd die before
he'd admit it.

522
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:27,760
When I dream some nights,
I see her.

523
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,760
She has long,
flowing brown hair

524
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,260
and big green-blue eyes,

525
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:38,240
Iike one of those pretty ladies
on infomercials late at night.

526
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,430
I used to lay right up
against the stone at night

527
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,240
when I couldn't sleep.

528
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:46,110
Pretend she was there
laying with me.

529
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,010
But now there's
all these weeds over her stone

530
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,450
that I'm allergic to.

531
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,640
Had to go to
the hospital once even.

532
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,240
Said I would have died if I
stayed around them long enough.

533
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,330
woman: Are you
tired of being you?

534
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,520
Then wake up!

535
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,660
Mama?

536
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,900
That's right.

537
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,910
I am here to
help you be the real you.

538
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,500
Are you tired of feeling down,
being laughed at?

539
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,140
Well, so was I.

540
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,550
I know it's hard to believe,

541
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:27,110
but, yes,
I was once ugly like you.

542
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,680
I, too, was like you--

543
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:32,620
alone, ugly, ethnic-looking
and sad.

544
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,450
You too, Mommy?

545
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:35,960
But not anymore!

546
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,960
Since Thermo Ball Blasting
Technique,

547
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:41,930
I've lost over
150 pounds in just five days!

548
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,660
With little or no scarring,
and minimal heart failure,

549
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,600
I feel great now!

550
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,500
Get off me, Buster!

551
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,410
It is you, Mommy!

552
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,710
This can make me
a real girl.

553
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,680
A pretty girl
like you, Mommy.

554
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,280
So call now.

555
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:04,720
Your dreams can
come true for you.

556
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:07,660
All you have to do
is dream them.

557
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:10,660
Financing is
available at only 200 down.

558
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,700
What are you waiting for?

559
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,230
The new world order
is coming.

560
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,360
Call now!

561
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,870
The dance-off prize.

562
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,810
Thank you, Mommy.

563
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,010
Thank you.

564
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,910
( whistle blowing )

565
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,240
All right, fellas,
come on, line up, quick.

566
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,580
Hustle, hustle, hustle.

567
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:06,520
All right, shiRts, skins,
shiRts, ski--

568
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,050
Hey.

569
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,150
Hey, Twinkle Toes.

570
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,750
Let's see that
body of yours.

571
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,930
( snickering )

572
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,120
Oh, my God,
look at this fag.

573
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,670
Looks like he's dead, bro.

574
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,170
- Are all fags this white, bro?
- It's major.

575
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,360
Come on, dudes.

576
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,230
I get pussy all the time.

577
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,070
Just don't wanna wrinkle
at a young age.

578
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,540
SPF, bros.

579
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,150
Hey, Sporky, wait up.

580
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,480
Listen, I'm sorRy for being
such a fag earlier.

581
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,390
Don't say that word.

582
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,430
Why not?

583
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:50,480
It's only mean
if you're a fag.

584
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,460
It's mean no matter what,
Charlie.

585
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:55,400
Okay... I'm sorRy.

586
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,460
Listen.

587
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,260
I saw you on
the dance-off list.

588
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,360
I can't believe it.

589
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,070
What are you
gonna do?

590
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,160
I... I don't know.

591
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,510
I mean, I-- I haven't really
thought about it yet.

592
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,880
Didn't sign myself up.

593
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,410
I'm not really
a dancer.

594
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,250
But, literally, I know all
the Justin Timberlake moves

595
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,650
by heaRt.

596
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,690
So, tell me
if you need any help.

597
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,020
Thanks, Charlie.

598
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,220
- Let's go.
- Oh, my God, they're coming.

599
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,990
Alli vienen las bitches!

600
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,920
# Is it 'cause
I'm cool? #

601
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,060
# Why you dress like me? #

602
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:32,570
# Is it honesty
or you just a fool? #

603
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,970
# Is it 'cause I'm cool? #

604
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,030
# Why the schoolkids
laugh #

605
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:40,640
# 'Cause the papers
got it wrong again #

606
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:43,040
# Is it 'cause I'm cool? #

607
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,110
# Take a piece
of me #

608
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,150
# SeRve me up
on a plate #

609
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,850
# In your restaurant #

610
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,080
# Is it 'cause I'm cool? #

611
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,960
# Is it 'cause
I'm cool? #

612
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,350
# Is it 'cause I'm fly? #

613
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,400
# 'Cause I said
what I said #

614
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:03,400
# When I said what I said #

615
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,200
# But I didn't say #

616
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,530
# Is it 'cause I'm hip? #

617
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:11,600
# Why you dig my shit
and you say I'm a fan #

618
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,270
# Now I understand #

619
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,580
# Is it 'cause I'm hot? #

620
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,640
# Why you mention me #

621
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,380
# In your
VIP memoRy #

622
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,680
# Is it 'cause I'm cool? #

623
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:29,120
# No one really
cooler ##

624
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,900
Oh, well, if it isn't
the little she-he

625
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:39,460
and the amazing Faggotron.

626
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,940
Shut up, Byotch.

627
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,910
You're just mad 'cause I took
your virginity and dumped you.

628
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,940
Please.

629
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:49,450
You couldn't get it up
if your daddies asked you to.

630
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,850
And I'm sure they do.

631
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,680
By the way, nice eye shadow,
Twinkle Toes.

632
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:55,810
So your color.

633
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:57,290
( laughing )

634
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,260
# Hit me baby
one more time #

635
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,920
Ooh, ooh!

636
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,090
That's not even Timberlake.

637
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,530
That's stupid Britney Spears,
a-holes.

638
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,000
Don't you dare

639
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,160
tell me about
Britney Spears.

640
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,670
She is a god to me,
you maggot.

641
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:17,000
Why don't-- why don't you
just leave him alone, Betsy?

642
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,370
Hmm, so "it" speaks.

643
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,410
I've been waiting for this for
some time now.

644
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,410
You and I have
a little unfinished business

645
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,850
to do, he-she!

646
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,350
Don't do it, Spork.

647
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,910
If you get in trouble, you won't
be allowed to do the dance-off.

648
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,480
Well, well, well.

649
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,860
So, Sporky the Dorky
thinks that she has a shot

650
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,950
at winning my dance-off, huh?

651
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:40,020
It's not your dance-off,
Byotch.

652
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,360
Oh, but it
will be, sister.

653
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:43,900
It will be.

654
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,100
Hey, you funny-lookin'
little white girls!

655
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,260
That's enough of that.

656
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,710
Get your little skinny asses
to class, pronto!

657
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,140
And that means you too, Spork.

658
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:57,040
( laughing )

659
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,180
Meet me after school tomorrow.

660
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,280
I'll teach you all I know about
Justin Timberlake.

661
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,880
There's no way
you're gonna lose.

662
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,630
Oh.

663
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,460
Hey, Chunk.

664
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,830
Hey, Spork.

665
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,970
So, um, thanks for
the advice the other day.

666
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,630
It kind of changed my life.

667
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,510
So I heard.

668
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,710
Got Betsy Byotch
dead in the face.

669
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,580
Pretty fuckin' rad.

670
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,780
( dance music playing )

671
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:41,520
Chunk?

672
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,250
Hey, were you
just gonna ride home,

673
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,850
or do you have time to hang?

674
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,920
Could maybe come
with me to my mom's restaurant

675
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,690
and help out in exchange for
some more advice.

676
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,820
( horn honking )

677
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,700
Holla!

678
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,810
So...

679
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:12,690
this is where
you work after school?

680
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,920
Kinda.

681
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,580
It's not like work-work.

682
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,650
I don't get paid
or anything.

683
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,920
I just fill out these little
papers with sayings and shit.

684
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,530
"Never take for granted

685
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:29,370
the things that matter
least in life."

686
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,770
My mom has me
help her with writing out

687
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,740
all the foRtune cookies.

688
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:35,940
- By hand?
- "Yeppers."

689
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,210
Cheaper, it keeps me busy
and out of trouble.

690
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,490
So, Spork, word is you're
hangin' with Twinkle Toes

691
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,620
and gearing up to tRy and win
the dance-off.

692
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,220
Don't be neRvous, kiddo.

693
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,420
You just keep doing
what you're doing,

694
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,860
no matter what anyone says.

695
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:58,230
Charlie, the dance-off--
none of it really matters.

696
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,330
All that matters is that you
give both a shot.

697
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,600
You hear me?

698
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,800
( woman speaking Mandarin )

699
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,260
Wh-- what was she saying,
Chunk?

700
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,600
She said you look
pretty dressed like that.

701
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,310
( dog barking )

702
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,480
# Hey #

703
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,780
# Hey #

704
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,450
# Hey ##

705
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,890
Hey, Spit, can I talk to you
for a minute?

706
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,520
What's up, kiddo?

707
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,800
Well, if you liked
somebody, what would you do?

708
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,740
Are you pregnant, Spork?

709
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,240
No, Spit.

710
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:12,110
Did you get someone
pregnant, Spork?

711
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,580
No, Spit.

712
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:18,010
Well, then, I guess
I'd probably tell 'em.

713
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,240
But tell them what?

714
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,980
That I wanted to
get 'em pregnant.

715
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,260
Look, Spork...

716
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,990
it just happens, you know.

717
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,190
Like...

718
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:38,960
when you're with someone,
it just happens or it don't.

719
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,470
There ain't no special words
or nothin' like that.

720
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,910
It's like, uh, us guys,

721
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,340
we just follow our dicks,
and you girls--

722
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:51,280
- Never mind, Spit.
- Oh.

723
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:54,150
I was gonna say...

724
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,080
you girls
follow your heaRts.

725
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,290
Hey, come here, kiddo.

726
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,450
Take this.

727
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,880
It'll help.

728
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:44,990
( sighing )

729
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,380
# One, two, three #

730
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:04,320
# So I woke up
early this morning #

731
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,290
# And I walked to the
five-and-dime #

732
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,920
# I saw this young lady #

733
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,120
# That's what she looked like
from behind #

734
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,130
# I tapped her
on the shoulder #

735
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,360
She's weird.

736
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,860
# Excuse me, ma'am #

737
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,800
# She looked back at me
and said #

738
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,840
# I'm half-man #

739
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:22,340
# Whoa #

740
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:23,310
# Spork #

741
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:24,200
# Phew #

742
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,170
# That girl #

743
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:29,650
# Whoa #

744
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,580
# Spork #

745
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:31,480
# Phew #

746
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,710
# That girl #

747
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,340
# That-that-that-that-that
that-that girl #

748
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,110
# That-that-that-that-that
that-that girl #

749
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:38,120
# That-that-that-that-that
that-that-that-that-that #

750
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,180
# That-that girl #

751
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,250
# Spork ##

752
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:42,730
( phone ringing )

753
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:44,900
Y'ello?

754
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,560
I have a favor
to ask you, okay?

755
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,260
And-- and please say yes,
please.

756
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,960
Well, that
depending on what it be.

757
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,000
Um, can you teach me
to dance?

758
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,770
Dance like you do?

759
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,900
I'm-- I'm competing in
the school dance-off,

760
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,470
and I don't think I've ever
danced in my entire life.

761
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:12,480
Girl, you must be trippin'.

762
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,290
Of course I'll help you,
you my girl.

763
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,590
I am?

764
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,850
Yeah.

765
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:19,160
You brought my broke ass home,
didn't ya?

766
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,100
But I thought you said
that we didn't have any friends

767
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,030
in the hood.

768
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,130
Spork, I said I'd help.

769
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,000
This ain't no Oprah,
so shut the hell up.

770
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:29,160
Come by the gymnasium tomorrow
during lunch.

771
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,230
Me and my hos
will hook you up.

772
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,370
Thanks, Tootsie Roll.

773
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,380
Oh, and Spork?

774
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,240
Wear sneakers.

775
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,610
Okay.

776
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:50,620
We can do this, Dorothy.

777
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,030
We can do this.

778
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,660
Okay, now, Treena, show Spork
the dookie dump.

779
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,030
Girl, you better
ask somebody.

780
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,430
Mm-hmm.

781
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,370
# Hit it #

782
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,650
Now this is
the dookie dump.

783
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,690
Okay, now, Spork,
you tRy the dookie dump.

784
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,620
# It was me
and the posse with... #

785
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,690
Um...

786
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,660
I'm-- I'm--

787
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:26,890
Damn, bitch!

788
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:28,260
Do like I say.

789
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:31,430
# Lo and behold there
appeared a mirage #

790
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,940
# He was hooking up a car
in his daddy's garage #

791
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:37,530
# We stopped short #

792
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:38,580
Oh!

793
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,670
# Did a double take #

794
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,740
Th-that's it, girl,
you almost got it.

795
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:44,870
Okay, now tRy to
stick your ass out more.

796
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:47,210
( laughing )

797
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:49,550
N-no, no, no.

798
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,650
Like this.

799
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,880
Boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom.

800
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,890
No, honey.

801
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,290
You need to move it,
rock your hips.

802
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:03,060
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

803
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,800
Little-- little
bit better, but...

804
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:09,310
Yeah.

805
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:10,600
That's it, girl.

806
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,730
Now let's tRy this.

807
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:13,000
Move it to the side.

808
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,540
Okay, girl.

809
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,250
Go, girl.

810
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:23,480
You've gotta be kidding me.

811
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:26,150
They're teaching her
how to dance?

812
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,160
If you could call it that.

813
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:30,660
Looks more like
some tribal ritual.

814
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:34,630
I hope she's the sacrifice.

815
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,830
I just got an idea.

816
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:42,030
Let's go ahead and allow
Sporky Dorky to compete.

817
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:44,470
It might just be the best
peRformance yet.

818
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:49,040
( giggling )

819
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:51,510
You are so
over-the-top sometimes.

820
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,650
Hey, Spork.

821
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,920
Hey, Charlie.

822
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:01,790
You ready?

823
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:04,230
I don't know.

824
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,320
Tootsie Roll tried to teach me
during lunch,

825
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,300
but I just can't
get my ass to move like hers.

826
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:12,000
( chuckling )

827
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:13,130
Come on, Spork.

828
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,830
Don't be so hard
on yourself.

829
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:17,240
I'll teach you all I know.

830
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:18,800
I have the whole
DVD collection

831
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,500
of all the Justin Timberlake
conceRts.

832
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,670
He'll show us what to do.

833
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:24,910
Come on!

834
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:37,790
( dance music playing )

835
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:41,870
Okay, Spork, watch.

836
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:43,370
Watch.

837
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:44,230
There!

838
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,960
Did you just see that?

839
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,500
Oh, my God,
he's so utterly amazing.

840
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:52,630
Did you know he's actually
a natural blonde?

841
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:56,570
Oh, my God.

842
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:59,410
You know Dorothy?

843
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,250
Hmm, yeah.

844
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,950
My mom got that for me
for my biRthday.

845
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:07,250
Pretty stupid, I know.

846
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:11,160
But it...
Iooks different.

847
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:13,160
And...

848
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:14,890
why is Dorothy white?

849
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:18,660
And where's
the city skyline?

850
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,730
Spork, you're talking about
"The Wiz."

851
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:24,740
That's the black version.

852
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:27,110
Oh.

853
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,080
Really?

854
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:32,450
Wow, I-- I never knew.

855
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,690
That's... that's weird.

856
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:39,950
I have the same exact poster on
my wall, except...

857
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,420
"The Wiz" poster.

858
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:43,930
That's my favorite movie.

859
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,720
I've never seen
"The Wiz,"

860
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,390
but that one right there,
that's my favorite movie.

861
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:53,100
Sometimes I pretend I'm Dorothy,
and I sing.

862
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:57,670
# Troubles melt
like lemon drops #

863
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:00,640
# Far above the chimney tops #

864
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:02,470
# That's where #

865
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:07,140
# You'll find me ##

866
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:11,120
Wow.

867
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:15,180
I never knew I'd tell anyone
that before.

868
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:16,990
Me neither.

869
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,190
My mom, when I was four,

870
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:23,130
went to go see
the Land of Oz.

871
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,930
I was mad at her, 'cause she
wouldn't take me,

872
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,030
but...

873
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:30,440
now I know that
she's happier over there.

874
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:32,670
See, she's like Dorothy.

875
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,070
She wants to
help eveRyone,

876
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:39,080
so she's gonna stay in Oz so she
can help people.

877
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:44,280
She has friends like
Michael Jackson, Tin Man.

878
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,810
You know... friends.

879
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:49,690
But I don't-- I don't even think
she's looking for

880
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,960
the Wiz anymore.

881
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:55,190
She's probably happy.

882
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:58,290
I'm gonna go there
soon too.

883
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:01,300
I'll... take you
with me, if you want.

884
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:06,570
I-- I-- I mean, you don't
have to.

885
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,410
I just--
I mean, if you wanted to--

886
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,450
Spork.

887
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,070
Dorothy's black.

888
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:20,250
So what?

889
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,620
Maybe my mom is black.

890
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,890
You don't know.

891
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,360
Maybe-- maybe in Oz,
you turn black.

892
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:28,330
I'm just sayin'.

893
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,990
I mean, I wouldn't
mind being black.

894
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,700
That's not the point.

895
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,470
You're weird.

896
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:43,880
I want to go home.

897
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:45,210
Wait.

898
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,410
Don't go.

899
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,250
What's your favorite color?

900
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:01,050
- Green.
- Why?

901
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:08,140
Because without the green ones,
they're boring.

902
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:13,300
Yeah, they are kind of boring
without the green ones.

903
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,110
They all kinda look the same.

904
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,290
Is it true?

905
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,690
Is what true?

906
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,970
I wanna go home.

907
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,840
Then go.

908
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:48,240
# This heaRt is over
the stars #

909
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:51,910
# This heaRt
is over the moon #

910
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:56,010
# But fate is filled... #

911
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:58,020
Please don't
laugh at me.

912
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,990
I think you're pretty.

913
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,490
Do you think
I'm pretty?

914
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,170
I think
you're veRy pretty.

915
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:26,720
# They shout aggression
at me #

916
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:31,590
# This lands there
on the wall #

917
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:35,790
# This life
is far too... ##

918
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:43,230
I'm-- I'm gonna win
the dance-off, Mommy.

919
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:46,270
I don't know how, but...

920
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,900
I'm gonna win.

921
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:51,100
And I'm gonna use the money to
be pretty like you.

922
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,310
And I made a friend.

923
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:58,580
A real one
this time.

924
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:02,140
He's really nice, too.

925
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:06,380
Mommy,
he's coming with me...

926
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:09,190
to see you in Oz.

927
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:12,820
He... he already knew about it
even before I met him,

928
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:16,530
but... he--

929
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,900
Well-- well, kind of,
but...

930
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:22,230
it was some
other version.

931
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:23,800
But it was pretty close.

932
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:28,400
Thanks, Mommy.

933
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,970
Damn, Spork!

934
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:04,340
You don't know how to
tell no time?

935
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,010
I'm sorRy.

936
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,850
My book bag broke open,
and I lost one of my books.

937
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,280
( laughing )

938
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:12,520
Hey, shut them holes,
chickenheads!

939
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:15,080
Like any of y'all know how
to read a damn book no way!

940
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,720
Mmm.

941
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:19,320
"Anyhoo,"
you been practicing?

942
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,860
Well, yeah, but...

943
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,590
I just can't do it,
Tootsie Roll.

944
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:24,960
I practiced all night.

945
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,090
Damn, child!

946
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:27,660
Ain't you good at anything?

947
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:33,200
Well, I'm really good
at Twister.

948
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,580
Ooh, girl!

949
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:38,210
I think I got an idea!

950
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,480
# Supersonic #

951
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:47,090
# Supersonic #

952
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,460
Okay, here it be, girl.

953
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:49,960
I'm fittin' to
yell out these colors,

954
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:51,590
and you just gonna do
your thing.

955
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:52,460
You dig?

956
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:54,190
Spork: I-- I-- I dig.

957
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:55,660
Okay, all right then.

958
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:56,790
So let's do this!

959
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:57,630
#... rockin'
your world #

960
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:58,960
# Supersonic #

961
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:01,700
# Supersonic #

962
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:03,300
Right hand on red.

963
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:07,840
Right foot on blue.

964
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:08,810
Listen...

965
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,070
Right hand on yellow.

966
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:12,840
Left foot on green.

967
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,380
Right hand on blue.

968
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:16,010
Left foot on yellow.

969
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:17,280
Left hand on blue.

970
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:18,340
Left foot on yellow.

971
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:20,050
Right hand on green,
left foot on red.

972
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,180
Right foot on yellow.

973
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:22,560
Green, yellow, red.

974
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:23,790
Blue, yellow, blue.

975
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:24,760
Red, red.

976
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:25,760
R-R-Red.

977
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:27,320
Yellow, yellow, yellow.

978
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,990
Red, green, red, yellow, blue,
red, yellow, green.

979
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:32,160
Yellow, red, green.

980
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,140
Red, red, red, green,
yellow, red...

981
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:42,040
Damn, child.

982
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:44,100
You just might win this shit
after all, girl.

( laughing )

1039
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:07,660
We are about to staRt rehearsals
for the dance-off.

1040
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:12,400
I want each
and eveRy one of you

1041
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:14,530
to understand

1042
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:17,070
that this is
not a competition,

1043
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:20,340
but simply
a means to have fun.

1044
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:23,140
Of course, there will be
a winner

1045
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:26,480
and a whole bunch of losers.

1046
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:29,820
You will be judged by
the audience cheering,

1047
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:33,120
so be sure to invite
all of your friends.

1048
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:37,490
Now, remember, only those
competing can be in here.

1049
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,360
The rest of you, wait outside.

1050
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,490
Okay.

1051
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:45,730
First up, we have Spork
and Her Only Friends.

1052
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:58,480
My name is Spork
and that's no lie

1053
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:00,980
If you don't like me you
should see my ride

1054
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:04,790
( laughing )

1055
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,280
But don't laugh at me
and be such a "meanie"

1056
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,950
'Cause I got
a really small wee-wee

1057
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,630
( laughing )

1058
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:25,830
Gotcha.

1059
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:27,170
Bitch.

1060
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,300
( laughing )

1061
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:32,040
Spork, wait!

1062
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,590
Spork, wait!

1063
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:48,260
Don't listen to them!

1064
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:56,770
Hey, girl,
where you runnin' off to?

1065
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,240
Hey, I'm talkin'
to you, ho!

1066
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:00,910
( dog barking )

1067
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:01,910
( dog yelping )

1068
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:25,460
Ow!

1069
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,130
You stupid ball!

1070
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,140
You stupid, stupid ball!

1071
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:30,470
I hate Spork!

1072
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:31,600
I hate her!

1073
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,840
And you're dead!

1074
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:34,430
You're not real!

1075
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:36,670
Nothing is real!

1076
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:47,490
( cRying )

1077
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:05,510
Why didn't you
take me with you?

1078
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,240
Why, huh?

1079
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:12,080
Why did you
lie to me?

1080
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:15,210
You said I'd be pretty
like you!

1081
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:17,620
I hate you!

1082
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:19,750
I don't want you
to ever come back!

1083
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:23,020
Ever, ever, ever!

1084
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:25,890
I believed you.

1085
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,330
Why did you have to
go without me?

1086
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:37,670
I don't wanna
ever wake up.

1087
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:41,940
Never, ever, ever.

1088
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,260
Looks like
the champ is up.

1089
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,470
What happened?

1090
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,870
Well, I think you went and acted
a fool is what happened.

1091
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:58,620
They laughed at me, Spit.

1092
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,250
All of them.

1093
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:09,490
I-- I have to move.

1094
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:10,930
Go away somewhere.

1095
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,730
Where you gonna go?

1096
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:13,860
Oz?

1097
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:19,470
There is no Oz, Spit.

1098
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,810
Yeah.

1099
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,680
I thought
you'd say that.

1100
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:28,340
Saw your poster
on the floor.

1101
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:30,480
Still, I figured you
might want it back up

1102
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:34,250
before you woke up.

1103
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,190
I don't.

1104
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:40,790
Thank you for fixing it,
but it's just a stupid poster.

1105
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:42,490
EveRything is stupid.

1106
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:49,330
Is it now?

1107
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:55,080
Oh, my God.

1108
01:00:56,510 --> 01:00:59,380
I'm-- I'm not dead.

1109
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:02,110
But the weeds and...

1110
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:04,310
I'm allergic and--

1111
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:05,910
Well, last time, I--

1112
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:08,480
That was then, Spork.

1113
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:09,920
People change.

1114
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:12,090
They grow up.

1115
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,320
Get stronger.

1116
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:21,440
I don't.

1117
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:23,740
I won't change.

1118
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:28,170
I'm just Spork forever.

1119
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:32,650
And what in the hell's wrong
with that, little sis?

1120
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:33,880
EveRything.

1121
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:38,450
Is it now?

1122
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:42,980
Well, seemed pretty tough
to me last night.

1123
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:45,290
You could hear me?

1124
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:49,160
Spork, I think the whole
trailer park could hear you.

1125
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:50,220
Why didn't you
do something?

1126
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,730
I did.

1127
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,100
I let you give off some steam,

1128
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:56,330
and there ain't nothin' wrong
with that, Sporky.

1129
01:01:56,410 --> 01:01:58,400
And I'll tell
you something else.

1130
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,240
You're more like our mama than
anybody else I ever seen.

1131
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:05,680
What was she like?

1132
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:13,880
She was like you.

1133
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:18,320
Different.

1134
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,020
In more ways than one.

1135
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:24,290
EveRybody thought
she was crazy.

1136
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:28,360
Damn near was,
to tell you the truth.

1137
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:32,930
Scared off Daddy real quick,
I used to think.

1138
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:36,340
But...

1139
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:39,080
she was...

1140
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:41,050
different in a lot of
good ways, too.

1141
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:48,950
Daddy used to
get pretty rough with me.

1142
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:50,120
She'd come a-runnin' out,

1143
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:53,420
hollerin', her hair all
frizzy-like,

1144
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,190
and chase him
off with a shovel.

1145
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:01,570
That was Mama for you.

1146
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,130
And I'll tell you
something else.

1147
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:08,970
When she was sick,

1148
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:12,310
and you were just a baby,

1149
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:14,820
she'd always tell me she wasn't
leavin' to go nowhere.

1150
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:19,310
Just to go see Oz.

1151
01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:23,290
And that she'd be
waitin' for us there.

1152
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:29,890
But there is no Oz, Spit.

1153
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:35,230
I've looked,
and she's not there.

1154
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:37,240
Sporky...

1155
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:39,280
you just been lookin' in
all the wrong places.

1156
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,070
You see, Oz...

1157
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:49,020
... it's right here.

1158
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:54,720
And that's where Mama's been
waitin' for you all along.

1159
01:03:57,390 --> 01:03:58,880
She ain't goin' nowhere.

1160
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:04,260
And neither am I, Spork.

1161
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:22,870
All right,
that's enough of that shit.

1162
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:24,510
Clean up this
diRty-ass room.

1163
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:28,820
Oh, and wipe your face.

1164
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:30,380
You got
a milk mustache.

1165
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,010
SorRy, Dorothy.

1166
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:53,270
I was upset and...

1167
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:55,110
I didn't mean to
take it out on you.

1168
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:06,320
Oh, my God!

1169
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,520
The dance-off!

1170
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:15,100
( phone ringing )

1171
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:18,200
Girl, I can hear you dialing my
number from out the window!

1172
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,840
I need to
ask you another favor.

1173
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:23,210
Can you help me pick out an
outfit for the dance-off?

1174
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,440
You really
gonna do this?

1175
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:32,380
Definitely.

1176
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:34,220
Well, then come on, ho!

1177
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:35,490
We ain't
got all day!

1178
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:38,150
I like rainbow sprinkles on my
ice cream pie

1179
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:39,160
Yeah right

1180
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:40,920
Meet me at
the ice cream truck

1181
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,790
I'll buy you an ice cream

1182
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:44,860
I'll whip out
my drumstick...

1183
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,600
Okay, honestly,
does it look any better?

1184
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:54,370
Do you really want to know?

1185
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,240
I don't seem to remember you
having that attitude

1186
01:05:56,310 --> 01:05:58,540
when I first met you, Loosie.

1187
01:05:58,620 --> 01:05:59,640
I sure hope you haven't
forgotten

1188
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,580
the dark ages, Loosie Goosie.

1189
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:03,550
You know, before I taught you
the effects of highlights

1190
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:05,610
and bleached
teeth and eye shadow.

1191
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:07,350
Or do I need to pull out
a photo?

1192
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:09,390
Glamour Shots
circa '98 much?

1193
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:11,520
Oh, I'd like to see that.

1194
01:06:11,590 --> 01:06:13,560
You know I've heard about
those photos.

1195
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:15,190
I'm fine, Byotch.

1196
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:17,700
I'm just totally over your
cunt-fest in the late.

1197
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:19,700
Like, I love
my bitch points too,

1198
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:21,740
but you've been acting
all "psycho-fied."

1199
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:24,470
I mean, that shoe polish
really messed up my pores.

1200
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:26,530
- Yeah, for sure.
- Def.

1201
01:06:26,610 --> 01:06:29,840
Sacrifices had to be made,
my little second-in-command.

1202
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:30,900
Really?

1203
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:32,380
'Cause I didn't
see you wearing any.

1204
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:37,880
Ladies, let's not quarrel
before my--

1205
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:40,550
our... big debut.

1206
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:43,420
Tonight is about
Britney Spears.

1207
01:06:43,490 --> 01:06:44,790
Tonight is the night we show her

1208
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:47,590
our gratitude for what
she's taught us.

1209
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:49,660
And I know
I've been a bit harsh lately,

1210
01:06:49,730 --> 01:06:51,760
but now that Spork is over
and done with,

1211
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:55,070
Iet's move on and remember
the sisterhood of the bitches.

1212
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:58,440
And that Spork was just
a taste...

1213
01:06:58,510 --> 01:06:59,480
of my rage.

1214
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:03,210
Now, are you
with me, bitches?

1215
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,270
For sure!

1216
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:09,920
# We like the cars #

1217
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:12,080
# The cars
that go boom #

1218
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:17,990
"Oh, that light is so harsh."

1219
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:20,890
Blanche DuBois,
Tennessee Williams.

1220
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,450
Thank you.

1221
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:25,430
Welcome, all of you,

1222
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:29,300
for the biggest moment
in all of your lives,

1223
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:31,030
and one of mine,

1224
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:35,370
the CherRy Lane Middle School
Dance-Off!

1225
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:37,210
( cheers and applause )

1226
01:07:40,050 --> 01:07:42,540
Now, I know

1227
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:45,590
that you are all
as excited as I am

1228
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:48,890
to see our shining young stars
hit the stage

1229
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:52,990
and show us
exactly what they're made of.

1230
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:54,890
# Beat, beat, beat, beat #

1231
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:55,690
# Beat #

1232
01:07:55,770 --> 01:07:57,670
# Hey, hey, hey #

1233
01:07:57,730 --> 01:07:58,890
# Come on eveRybody #

1234
01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:00,060
# Beat ##

1235
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:15,740
So, without fuRther ado,

1236
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:19,620
we kick off
the dance-off first with

1237
01:08:19,690 --> 01:08:23,390
Betsy Byotch
and the Bitches!

1238
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,690
( cheers and applause )

1239
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:36,960
# Oh baby, baby #

1240
01:08:40,410 --> 01:08:42,110
# Oh baby, baby #

1241
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:47,540
# Oh baby, baby #

1242
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:50,920
# How was I
supposed to know #

1243
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,890
# That something wasn't
right here #

1244
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:57,890
# Oh baby, baby #

1245
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:01,590
# I shouldn't
have let you go #

1246
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:05,860
# And now you're right out
of sight yeah... #

1247
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:12,940
Okay, okay.

1248
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:14,140
Move outta my way, hos.

1249
01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:15,540
Damn, that's
a big-ass hat.

1250
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:17,480
- Whoo, that's a big-ass hat.
- Stupid hat!

1251
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:18,710
This ain't no Vegas.

1252
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:21,720
#... is killin' me and I #

1253
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:23,650
# I must confess #

1254
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,550
# I still believe #

1255
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,090
# Still believe #

1256
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:30,350
# When I'm not with you
I lose my mind #

1257
01:09:30,430 --> 01:09:34,190
# Give me a sign #

1258
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:37,290
# Hit me baby
one more time #

1259
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:40,960
# My loneliness
is killing me #

1260
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,560
Okay, you ready for this?

1261
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,040
A'ight then.

1262
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:46,940
All right, I'm fittin' to be
right here,

1263
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:48,670
yelling out the orders.

1264
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:51,040
Whatever you do,
don't stop.

1265
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:54,880
# And give me a sign #

1266
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:57,480
# Hit me baby
one more time ##

1267
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:01,520
( cheers and applause )

1268
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:06,120
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1269
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,220
That was quite a show!

1270
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:12,060
Let's hear it for
Betsy Byotch and the Bitches!

1271
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:14,190
( cheers and applause )

1272
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:15,400
The little bitches.

1273
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,480
You've gotta be
kidding me.

1274
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:26,140
What are those
things doing here?

1275
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:29,190
Looks like not eveRybody
is scared of you.

1276
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:30,580
Oh, uh...

1277
01:10:30,650 --> 01:10:32,350
Okay, okay, quiet now!

1278
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:34,550
Quiet, quiet!

1279
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:38,080
Now, there's been a change in
the schedule,

1280
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:40,560
apparently, I believe.

1281
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:43,460
Uh...

1282
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:45,060
Well, yes.

1283
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:48,660
There's been a change
in the schedule.

1284
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:50,300
Hmm.

1285
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:54,970
Next up will be
a peRformance given by J--

1286
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,770
( feedback blaring )

1287
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:02,180
What the fuck
is this about?

1288
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,040
# Lady boy, lady boy #

1289
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,380
# Lady boy, lady boy #

1290
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:41,220

1293
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,420
Right hand on yellow!

1294
01:11:51,370 --> 01:11:52,860
Right hand on red!

1295
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:54,430

1301
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,410
- Whoa.
- Whoa, girl.

1302
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:10,250
# Nobody rocks like the girls
I'm running with #

1303
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,880
Damn!

1304
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:13,390
#... everybody's in on it #

1305
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:16,520
# Some girls talk to the boys
in the chat room #

1306
01:12:16,590 --> 01:12:19,790
# My girls talk to
the boys in the back room #

1307
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:22,630
# Hit me up I'm that chick

( cheers and applause )

1329
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:39,200
Shut up, shut up,
all of you.

1330
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,210
Stop it!

1331
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:42,370
( cheers and applause )

1332
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:57,950
This is all 'cause of you,
Tootsie Roll.

1333
01:13:58,030 --> 01:13:59,520
Thank you.

1334
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,720
Girl, don't even play.

1335
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,560
I don't know what the hell you
did out there,

1336
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:05,730
but it wasn't
for sure nothin' I taught you.

1337
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:06,790
Get it, girl.

1338
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:08,630
Get it for reals.

1339
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:11,260
( cheers and applause )

1340
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:16,280
Quiet!

1341
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:17,680
Quiet, quiet!

1342
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:20,380
Quiet, shh!

1343
01:14:20,450 --> 01:14:21,580
Shut up!

1344
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:25,880
Thank you.

1345
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:31,890
Well, I must say, this is
quite a surprise indeed.

1346
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,120
In all fairness,

1347
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,930
I think the winner has already
been decided.

1348
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,660
Too bad, bunnies.

1349
01:14:37,730 --> 01:14:41,030
This was a real shocker,
wasn't it, kids?

1350
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:42,830
The winner is...

1351
01:14:42,910 --> 01:14:44,200
( imitating fanfare )

1352
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:50,570
The winner is Spork!

1353
01:14:50,650 --> 01:14:55,170
( cheers and applause )

1354
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:03,180
all: Spork, Spork, Spork!

1355
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:07,030
Spork, Spork, Spork,
Spork, Spork, Spork!

1356
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:09,830
Spork, Spork, Spork,
Spork, Spork!

1357
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:12,730
Spork, Spork, Spork,
Spork, Spork, Spork, Spork!

1358
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,130
Spork, Spork, Spork, Spork,
Spork, Spork...

1359
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,540
( cheers and applause )

1360
01:15:42,930 --> 01:15:45,420
Tootsie Roll, um, I--

1361
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:46,760
I know you said we're not
supposed to have

1362
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,430
any friends in the hood.

1363
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:52,000
But you're the closest thing
I've ever had to a real friend.

1364
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:54,740
And...

1365
01:15:54,810 --> 01:15:56,640
I want you to have this.

1366
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:59,150
Okay?

1367
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:01,780
Spork, I--
I can't take this.

1368
01:16:01,850 --> 01:16:04,250
You earned it, girl,
you worked hard.

1369
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,190
I'm cool.

1370
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:07,850
I'm not
worried about that.

1371
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,550
I-- I know you're cool.

1372
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:12,120
But, again,
you're my friend.

1373
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:15,160
And that's what
friends do.

1374
01:16:15,230 --> 01:16:16,930
At least my friends.

1375
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,260
It's yours,
you earned it.

1376
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:23,330
Sweet!

1377
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:27,210
Oh!

1378
01:16:29,010 --> 01:16:31,380
You're the coolest white bitch
I know, Spork.

1379
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:33,210
- Thanks.
- Hear that, okay?

1380
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:34,480
Okay.

1381
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:35,710
Come on, y'all,
let's go.

1382
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:37,450
- Bye, Spork!
- Bye, Spork!

1383
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:38,710
Later, Charlie,
bye, Spork.

1384
01:16:49,170 --> 01:16:50,690
This is it, tripod!

1385
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:52,360
You may have convinced
the school that you're normal,

1386
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:55,460
but I am so gonna pound
your face in!

1387
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:57,770
Oh, shut
the fuck up already!

1388
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:58,700
Jesus.

1389
01:16:58,770 --> 01:17:00,640
You are so drama-rama.

1390
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:03,110
You know what, bitch?

1391
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:06,640
I have just about had it
with your insubordination.

1392
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:07,840
Uh!

1393
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:12,880
Shit, dude, that bitch
was so annoying.

1394
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:15,950
Wow, that was amazing.

1395
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:17,290
The name's Chunk.

1396
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,330
Kinda like "chink," but instead
they call me Chunk.

1397
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,420
Loosie Goosie.

1398
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,660
Kinda like Lucy,
but they call me Loosie.

1399
01:17:42,180 --> 01:17:45,420
So, what you did with
Tootsie Roll and the money--

1400
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:47,960
that was pretty cool.

1401
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:49,420
She's my friend.

1402
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:53,190
That's what friends do.

1403
01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:59,560
Hey, Spork,
can I ask you something?

1404
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,430
Sure.

1405
01:18:04,470 --> 01:18:07,340
If you've
never had a friend...

1406
01:18:07,410 --> 01:18:09,310
how do you know what a friend
would do?

1407
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:16,310
'Cause...

1408
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:18,790
it just feels right.

1409
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:23,150
Yeah.

1410
01:18:24,690 --> 01:18:26,290
Spork?

1411
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,590
Yeah, Charlie.

1412
01:18:31,730 --> 01:18:33,330
Will you be
my girlfriend?

1413
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,540
Sure.

1414
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,440
Yes!

1415
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:52,610
Spork: And that was
my first boyfriend.

1416
01:18:52,690 --> 01:18:55,160
Made my first friend
and boyfriend

1417
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:56,920
in one awesome day.

1418
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:04,660
It's funny, really,
when Charlie asked me

1419
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:08,400
how I ever really knew what
a good friend would be like.

1420
01:19:08,470 --> 01:19:11,630
'Cause I really never did know.

1421
01:19:11,710 --> 01:19:15,370
But there's a lot of things
I still don't really know.

1422
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,810
Why people say mean things

1423
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,580
or huRt other people when
they're different.

1424
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:23,440
I don't think
I'll ever know.

1425
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,280
The truth is...

1426
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:31,880
I don't wanna know.

1427
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,660
'Cause, you see,
it doesn't matter.

1428
01:19:36,370 --> 01:19:38,660
All that matters is the people
we care about

1429
01:19:38,730 --> 01:19:40,220
and the ones
who care about us.

1430
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:57,380
See, Mommy...

1431
01:19:57,450 --> 01:19:58,510
you made it.

1432
01:20:00,990 --> 01:20:02,290
You made it
to the Emerald City.

1433
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:14,530
I used to think that
my only dream

1434
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:16,540
was to be someone else...

1435
01:20:16,610 --> 01:20:18,370
anything else
than what I was.

1436
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:27,210
And somehow I got it.

1437
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,840
I finally figured out
how to be somebody

1438
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:32,110
I never really ever
got to be in my whole life.

1439
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:36,980
Myself.

1440
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:43,860
# Hey #

1441
01:20:43,930 --> 01:20:44,830
# Hey #

1442
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:48,530
# Hey #

1443
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:49,540
# Ooh-ah #

1444
01:20:49,610 --> 01:20:51,000
# Hey #

1445
01:20:51,070 --> 01:20:52,630
# Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey #

1446
01:20:52,710 --> 01:20:54,070
# You you're such a freak #

1447
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:55,870
# When you're at the paRty you
don't mess with a freak #

1448
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:57,610
# Ooh you're such a dork #

1449
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:59,710
# Nobody kisses you
on the dance floor #

1450
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:02,110
# Pick your boogie #

1451
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:03,880
# Then dance #

1452
01:21:03,950 --> 01:21:05,680
# Pop your booty #

1453
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:07,650
# Throw up your hands #

1454
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:08,990
# You don't hear them #

1455
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:10,890
# When they

01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,890
# Hey you you're

# When you're at the paRty you
don't mess with a freak #

1458
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,760
# You ain't got no money #

1459
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:18,630
# You ain't
got no friends #

1460
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:20,460
# You just came to paRty #

1461
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:22,500
# You just

# Nobody kisses you

1466
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:32,040
# You just want to join

1467
01:21:32,110 --> 01:21:33,880
# You just

01:21:33,950 --> 01:21:35,750
# You ain't tRying to
huRt nobody #

1469
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:37,720
# You ain't
tRying to make no friends #

1470
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:41,450
# EveRything and eveRybody
always has to disappear #

1471
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,790
# When you staRt
to feel your body move #

1472
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:45,420

# Look what I got

# Magic hats and a house

# Now I can do
anything I need #

1486

# I hear my world and it is
hollering #

# Let me pull this

# Damn you ain't seen nothing

1501
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:16,410
# I feel like
I'm on top of the world #

1502
01:23:16,490 --> 01:23:19,580
# With the stars in the sky
I'm the only girl #

1503
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:22,490
# Time moves by so quickly #

# Daydream
