BOBBY: Hello, I'm Bobby Stern.
Congratulations.

00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,440
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, marvelous.

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,360

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,280
Enjoy.

Hey, Jimmy, what's
your game today?

Five-card draw.

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,010
Mr. Kamenev, with all due
respect, I told you, no.

14
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,470
Oh, but that is unacceptable.

15
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,720
Relax, have a drink.

16
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,180
I think you should reconsider.

17
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,520
This is my casino, and
I do not need your help.

18
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,360
You needed my help
getting in here.

19
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,360
Now that you have what
you want, you think

20
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,740
you can turn your back on me?

21
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,630
Are you threatening
my daughter?

22
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,180
Such a beautiful little girl.

23
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,800

if she had accident.

JACK (ON PHONE): What's wrong?

40
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,850
You remember, you once said to
call if I ever needed a friend?

41
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,640
Well, I'm calling.

On what grounds, hmm?

46
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,360
Loitering in a casino?

47
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,820
I can't take this.

48
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,990
Stop this.

49
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,110
Listen to me.

50
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:29,080
If we give in to them,
they will take everything.

51
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,750
I don't care about
the casino, Bobby.

52
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,580
I want out.

There's only one ace
left in the deck.

Jack Devlin.

00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:56,650
Harry Eyeball, when
did you get out of jail?

58
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,520
You shouldn't be here.

00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,440
Really?

00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,530
According to who?

61
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,900
Mr. Kamenev.

62
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,490
Oh, you're working
for that scumbag.

63
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,660
Now, tell me something.

64
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,990
Uh, do your checks
actually clear?

00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,500
Thanks for coming, man.

75
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,670
Any time, Bobby.

76
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,920
Remember Nicky, don't you?

77
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,380
- Hey, Nicky.
- Jack.

78
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,880
- How you doing?
- Hey.

CASEY: Yeah, hi, Uncle Jack.

What happened?

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,600
Hey, can you teach me that
thing you did with the cards?

85
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,730
Oh, yeah, sure.
[stammering]

86
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,350
Maybe a little
later, all right?

87
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,150
We have to talk some business.

88
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,020
OK.

89
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,940
Promise I'll show you later.

90
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,320
She has an IQ of 165.

91
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,280
I don't know where
she gets it from.

92
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,990
She already knows
how to double down.

93
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,280
She's like a sponge, you know?

94
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,410
JACK: Well, that
could be useful.

95
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,370
So what's with Kamenev?

96
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,040
He wants in on my business.

97
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,920
I tell the guy, no,
but he doesn't listen.

98
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,340
Yeah, but how'd you
get mixed up with him?

99
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,010
Jack, you know, it's a
casino, and I'm not an angel.

100
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,470
I've got a history.

101
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,800
But he's coming
after my little girl,

102
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,840
and that's crossing the line.

103
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,430
She's our whole world, Jack.

104
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,310
We've got to get
her out of here.

105
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,060
Don't worry.

106
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,610
CASEY: So I bet it
on this horse, see?

107
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,030
He came in so late, they paid
the jockey time and a half.

108
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,030
Ba-da boom!

109
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,530
Where'd you hear
a joke like that?

110
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,830
Wait, here's another one.

111
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,540
What's black and white
and red all over?

112
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,700
I'm afraid to guess.

113
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,330
A nun in a blender!

114
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,790
Ugh, you know, that's awful.

115
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,590
Where are you
getting this stuff?

116
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,470
Cumming, in the
showroom lounge.

117
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,340
This is Max.

118
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:33,720
Nice to meet you, Max.

119
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,270
Daddy says you're the
only man in the world

120
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,730
he trusts in this situation.

121
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,110
He says he's been in
many scrapes with you

122
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,900
and that there's no better
backup in a firefight.

123
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,690
Is that true?

124
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:21,980
Welcome to my house.

125
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,450
OK, kid, see, I'm
gonna check the house,

126
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,660
make sure everything is locked.

127
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,330
Don't worry about it.

128
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,000
There's an armed guard out
front and another one on patrol.

129
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,620
So guess I'm out
of a job then, Max.

130
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,790
I'm gonna go get some milk.

131
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,590
OK.

132
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,300
All right, I'm going upstairs.

133
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,260
Won't be a second.

Drop the gun or she's dead.

142
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,310
Let her go.

143
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,060
Lose the piece.

144
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,030
Let her go.

145
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,790
I said, drop it.

146
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,750
Don't worry, Case.

147
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,540
You got milk.

148
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,710
MAN: Drop the gun.

149
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,460
I mean it.

Uncle Jack.

00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,400
Uncle Jack, what happened?

161
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,360
I can't see.

162
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,110
Uncle Jack.

163
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,950
Here, put me on your back.

164
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,330
Get us--

165
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,960
Casey, get us out of here.

00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,960
Where's the door?

To the right, to the right.

Go to the right.

Turn around.
We'll go out the back way.

To the left.
Watch out for the door.

No, no, no, to the right.
To the right.

OK, go straight.

[grunting]

188
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,200
Look out, 12 o'clock!

189
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,580
[gunshots]

190
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,670
To the right, to the right!

191
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,540
Go to the right!

192
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,180
Get down!

193
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:05,970

[gunshots]

198
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,030
Oh, no.

199
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,820
[groan]

200
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,910
Uncle Jack.

201
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,990
[groan]

202
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,830
Casey, Casey.

203
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,290
[groan]

204
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:44,920
[door slams]

205
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,430
Whoa!

206
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,760
[explosion]

207
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,900
[grunt]

208
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,860
[gunshots]

209
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,270
Agh!

210
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,540
[gasping]

211
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,330
Jack.

212
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,380
It's OK.

213
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:35,890
Casey?

214
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,230
Casey.

215
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,140
Hi, Mom.

216
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,850
Sweetheart.

217
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,270
Are you all right?
Are you OK?

218
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,610
You were right, Dad.

219
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,940
There's no better
backup in a firefight.

220
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,690
[laughing]

221
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:49,200
Sweetheart, you're freezing.

222
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Jacky, Jack, are
you all right, man?

223
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,830
JACK (WHISPERING): I'm OK.

224
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,250
How's Casey?

225
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,830
She's fine, she's fine.

226
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,670
She's alive 'cause of you.

227
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,720
Good, 'cause I'm
gonna need her help when

228
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,220
I go after the rest of 'em.

229
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,570
DR. STEIN: You said
on the phone that you

230
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:31,410
had trouble with Percodan.

231
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:37,370
I've been off it
35, no, 36 days.

232
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,710
That's good.

233
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,330
You were on it because
of the injuries

234
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,210
you sustained in Atlantic City?

235
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,840
Yeah, it was mostly my leg.

236
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,960
DR. STEIN: And the leg
doesn't bother you anymore?

237
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,550
Off and on.

238
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,090
Good, sounds
like good progress.

239
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,050
Do you mind if I
smoke or are you one

240
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,430
of those anti-smoking fanatics?

241
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,430
Hey, it's your body.

242
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,660
Whoa, is that just a cigar?

243
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,460
How did you do that?

244
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,960
I'm good with my hands.

245
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,760
I'm sure you are.

246
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:36,010
How long have you been
doing this bodyguard work?

247
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,680
About two years,
since the Marshals

248
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,480
no longer required my services.

249
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,730
It's a way to make
money doing what I know.

250
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,850
So why are you here?

251
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:53,280
Your blouse, is it white?

252
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,700
Yes.

253
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:00,660
Would you come here, please?

254
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:15,590
In Atlantic City, after I
was hit by this white light,

255
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,220
I went into a tunnel.

256
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,270
A near-death experience,
it's fairly common.

257
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:28,230
But now, when I see white--

258
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,650
[gunshot]

259
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,410
[groaning]

260
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,000
Ooh, OK, are you OK?

261
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,750
[sigh]

262
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,800
So you feel out of control
when you see the color white.

263
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,970
Never experienced
anything like it in my life.

264
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,510
Jack, have you ever
heard of a phobia,

265
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,890
like, fear of heights,
claustrophobia?

266
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:06,520
Sure, but to the color white?

267
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,650
Color phobias
are actually fairly

268
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,190
common as far as phobias go.

269
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,230
[scoffs]

270
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,780
Never been afraid in my life.

271
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,990
It's not that you're afraid
that the color white is

272
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,950
going to hurt you or kill you.

273
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:18,820
But--

274
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,490
[clears throat]

275
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,910
--you are afraid of something
that the white represents.

276
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,790
I'm not sure I follow.

277
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:31,290
OK, for example, a person
may have a phobia of knives.

278
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,420
That doesn't mean they're
afraid every knife they see

279
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,260
is going to stab them.

280
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,470
They might be afraid that
they're going to lose

281
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:42,180
control and stab someone else.

282
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,390
OK.

283
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,970
DR. STEIN: The color
white represents

284
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:48,350
something to your subconscious
that you are afraid of.

285
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:55,320
Now, we're gonna take
this one step at a time.

286
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,530
The good news is is that
most phobias are curable.

287
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:03,200
So what do I do for now?

288
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,700
Keep your glasses on and
keep your appointments.

289
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,500
I see you in a couple of days.

290
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,880
[camera shutters]

291
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,100
WOMAN: Hey, hey!
Hey, hey!

292
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,980
Come on!

293
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,360
[interposing voices]

294
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,360
MAN: Cinder!

295
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,090
Honey, will you get me
some more champagne, please?

296
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,130
Sure, sweetheart.

297
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,940
Dorothy, honey, what's wrong?

298
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:23,610
[gunshot]
[glass shattering]

299
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,410
[groan]

300
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,030
[music playing]

301
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:47,370
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on.

302
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:51,870
Walk me into your temple.

303
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:58,330
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on.

304
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,710
I walk into your temple.

305
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,480
WOMAN: All right,
ladies, keep it moving.

306
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,440
Come on, let's go.

307
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,190
Come on.

308
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,830
Oh well, come on,
[inaudible],, as she

309
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,120
washes out in the hot lights.

310
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,920
Hey there.

311
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,670
How long is she
gonna be out there?

312
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,510
Six outfits, half an hour.

313
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,970
You said you've got
the place secure.

314
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,970
We just got another one
delivered by a messenger.

315
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,320
DEREK: Well, what about
the messenger service?

316
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,620
TIM: Guy came in, paid cash,
nondescript, no prints.

317
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,370
She needs to know.

318
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,240
Absolutely not.

319
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,700
It's her New York debut.

320
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,870
The Vencini
announcement's on Friday.

321
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,540
I don't want to spook her.

322
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,920
You don't want to
get her killed either.

323
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,790
This guy is a psychopath.

324
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,550
DEREK: That's why
I hired you people.

325
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,300
DON: Look, we've
locked the perimeter.

326
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,010
It's a hardened site.

327
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,380
Threat is minimal.

328
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,010
I'm telling you,
it's too risky.

329
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,290
DEREK: OK, baby, time
to rock and roll, right?

330
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,670

Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

337
00:23:52,430 --> 00:24:00,220
I want into the temple,
the temple, the temple.

homemade by any human
being in the history

344
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:38,820
of the city of New York, made
especially for you, my friend.

345
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,780
There you go.

346
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,660
[phone ringing]

347
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,950
Thanks, Thomas.

348
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,580
Eh, yeah?

349
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,700
Someone's here to see Jack.

350
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,000
Who is it?

351
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,330
A lovely young lady.

352
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,290
Ah, well then, you know,
send her-- wait a minute.

353
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,500
Is she wearing white?

354
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,420
No, just kidding.

355
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,170
All right, send her up.

356
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,810
MARK: Uh, Mr. Jack Devlin.

357
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:03,600
Yeah?

358
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,190
Uncle Jack.

359
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:22,240
Casey, ah, mmm, oh, it's
so great to see you again.

360
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:31,040
Casey, hey, what's
the matter, sweetie?

361
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,420
MARK: My name is Mark Smoot.

362
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,550
I'm here at the
bequest of Bobby Stern.

363
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,340
I'm his attorney.

364
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,590
We have some serious
business to talk about.

365
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,430
Oh, what's the--

366
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,510
In private would be best.

367
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,180
Sure.

368
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:53,980
Hey, Casey, hey, I want you
to meet my friend, the pirate,

369
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,360
one eye and everything.

370
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:01,820
Casey, Max, meet
Thomas the Pirate.

371
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,740
How do you do?

372
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,490
Hello.

373
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:07,370
THOMAS: All right,
come with me now.

374
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:09,710
CASEY: You don't look like
much of a pirate to me.

375
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,870
Yeah, well, looks
don't make the pirate.

376
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,330
It's the ugly things we do.

377
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,340
That's what makes the pirate.

378
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:28,560
[door closes]

379
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,770
When was the accident?

380
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:33,400
MARK: The accident
was a week ago.

381
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,560
I know that it's not
much consolation,

382
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,980
but, uh, neither Bobby
or Nicky suffered.

383
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,990
It was immediate.

384
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,240
Casey's spirits
really lifted when

385
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,410
she heard we were coming here.

386
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,750
She told me all about you.

387
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,500
JACK: How is she taking it?

388
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,460
MARK: Well, sir, I
must say, pretty well.

389
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,130
I guess I don't
have any choice, do I?

390
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,300
MARK: It's what Bobby wanted.

391
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:06,140
And from what Casey tells
me, I am sure you are

392
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,050
going to make a fine father.

393
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,940
So what should we do?

394
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,860
Want to play a game or
something, like chess, perhaps?

395
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,740
I warn you, I--
I take it very seriously though.

396
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,530
Ah, chess?

397
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,330
CASEY: I don't want
to do anything.

398
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,160
Well, you know, I'm
an expert at that too--

399
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,040
[chuckling]

400
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,460
--doing nothing.

401
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,000
But then, you know,
how do we determine

402
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,330
a winner if we're just
going to sit around and do--

403
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:46,140
Hey, Casey, hey, what do
you think of my place, huh?

404
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,640
It's OK.

405
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,180
OK?

406
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:51,970
It sucks.

407
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:08,200
Hey, you know, I've
got satellite TV.

408
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,200
Thomas will cook you something.

409
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,370
Hey, no, now,
see, I don't cook.

410
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,870
I create.

411
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:21,250
And once you have tasted
what I create, never will

412
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:24,920
you want to leave us.

413
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,220
Never, promise.

414
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,560
Echo 25 to base.

415
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,810
This is rooftop.

416
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,230
The package is in the lobby.

417
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,360
Copy, Echo.

418
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,860
Perimeter is secure.

419
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,400
DEREK (ON SCREEN): They
insisted she be there.

420
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,860
That's-- yeah, I know.

421
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,940
Well, listen,
apparently, there's

422
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,860
some sort of a security--

423
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,160
DON: OK, listen up.

424
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,990
We're changing frequencies
every 12 hours.

425
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,950
If you see anything
with ID, ping us.

426
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:55,080
Now this woman is about
to receive a $6 million

427
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,000
contract, gentlemen.

428
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,330
So remember, dead
clients don't pay.

429
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,380
[scoff]

430
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,790
DEREK: Well, they can sod off.

431
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:02,670
Yeah, because at--

432
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,380
[stuttering]

433
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,880
At 10 grand a day for 25 men,
they better be bloody good.

434
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,390
Yes, right, Donald Tragle.

435
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,560
He did Secret Service
for George Bush,

436
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,980
did Michael Jackson's last tour.

437
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,230
What, Cinder?

438
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,060
Are you serious?

439
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,270
She's a rock.

440
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,940
They know she loves
the attention.

441
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,940
[chuckling]

442
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,610
Rehearsal's this afternoon.

443
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:28,700
Yeah, we'll make
the announcement.

444
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,410
All right, ciao.

445
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,370
Oh, bloody clients.

446
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,280
Why'd you lie to 'em?

447
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,120
It's an advertising
agency, darling.

448
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,540
They expect me to lie.

449
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,460
Look, baby, I'm on
this, all right?

450
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,670
We got wall-to-wall men outside.

451
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:47,130
That's great, but why
haven't you told the police

452
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,840
about the notes and the calls?

453
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,260
Oh, and have all the bloody
tabloids down in the lobby?

454
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,930
No, thank you.

455
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,760
As far as the press knows,
this is just some random wanker

456
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,010
firing at the show.

457
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,390
I just wish this was over.

458
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,310
DEREK: Would you relax?

459
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,060
[sigh]

460
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:06,440
Look, come Friday, you're going
to be on the Concorde to Paris.

461
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,610
This wacko is just after
the next "Cosmo" girl.

462
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,530
[chuckling]

463
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,360
That's it.

464
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,660
Police can't find the slug.

465
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,870
It's disintegrated.

466
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,410
This guy's a real pro.

467
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:24,210
Maybe he just has access
to professional equipment.

468
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,750
I think you should call off
the rehearsal until we can

469
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,260
sweep the adjacent buildings.

470
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,680
Canceling the rehearsal
is not exactly an option.

471
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,300
We had a recon team
downtown since 10:30.

472
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,850
Reconned?

473
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:38,680
Like you did the other day?

474
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,850
All I know is this guy can
hit from 10 blocks away.

475
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,060
How are you going
to secure that?

476
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,450
So you are with
him all the time now.

477
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,280
During the day mostly.

478
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:58,080
I don't sleep with him.

479
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,250
So, pick a card--

480
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,040
sign it.

481
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:07,500
CASEY: And the color white
really makes you feel bad?

482
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,300
Yeah, It's called a phobia.

483
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,420
OK, put it back.

484
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:20,470
So, now, I'm going to make
your card appear in my wallet

485
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,730
where I get to
keep all this cash.

486
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,980
I only think of good
things when I see white--

487
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:32,240
like clouds-- big, fluffy
clouds and bunny rabbits.

488
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,610
Popcorn is kind
of wet, isn't it?

489
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:37,030
And there's always sugar--

490
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:41,450
or snow-- or angels and heaven.

491
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,920
I miss them too, Casey.

492
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,890
You'll see why
again, Uncle Jack.

493
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,550
I'll help you.

494
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,470
OK.

495
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,390
Deal?

496
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,020
All right, now,
ready for your guard.

497
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,310
Yep.

498
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:09,150
OK, now, your card
is in my wallet.

499
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,490
Sorry, Uncle Jack.

500
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,490
Wait a second--

501
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,740
I said in my wallet, right?

502
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,160
Yeah.

503
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,040
Let's have a look in here.

504
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,870
What is that?

505
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,630
Wow!

506
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,300
How'd you do that?

507
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,090
Magic.

508
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,220
Yeah?

509
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,470
Yo Jack.

510
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,260
Jim?

511
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,560
Let's do lunch.

512
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:46,770
JACK: How is the
babysitting business, boss?

513
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:49,100
TIM: Got a boy-- not as much
fun since you left, Jack.

514
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,310
JACK: How long did
it last with you?

515
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,690
What?

516
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,280
About a month after
we left the Marshals?

517
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,190
Ha, why don't
you try two weeks?

518
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,910
You ever miss being a Fed?

519
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,120
We spent more time fighting
the bureaucracy than we

520
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,160
did fighting the criminals.

521
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,410
You remember that.

522
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,830
You said they'd
have to carry you out.

523
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:11,790
Yeah, well,
things change, Jack.

524
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,840
You didn't have
to quit over me.

525
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,380
Who said that?

526
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,470
I quit because I got tired
of going out for scungille

527
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:20,260
at 2:00 AM in the morning.

528
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,640
OK.

529
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,260
So what's this about?

530
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,270
Name is Cinder James.

531
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:35,150
Some head hunter from Elite
found her waiting tables

532
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,650
in Little Rock.

533
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,700
This girl just
signed a $6 million

534
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,740
contract with Vencini Jewelers.

535
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,450
What kind of girl?

536
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,500
Somebody is trying
to cancel her contract.

537
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,710
And they are using
vanishing loads.

538
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,000
Who have you got on it?

539
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,330
- Don Tragle.
- Ah.

540
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,750
I know.
I know.

541
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,960
Vencini was impressed
with his, uh, resume.

542
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,250
Well, just what your back.

543
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,800
The Secret Service
agents are spoiled--

544
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,930
three-hour shift changes,
White House food,

545
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,970
autographed pictures
of the first lady.

546
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,720
Well, that's why I'm here.

547
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,140
This sniper-- he
operates like a real pro.

548
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:11,980
Tragle is way over his head.

549
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,110
You sure you don't want
to join me on this?

550
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,110
I'm a new father--

551
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:19,990
4 feet, 76 pounds of
bouncing baby girl.

552
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:23,280
I got to find a dentist, buy
a bunk bed, set up a carpool,

553
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,870
meet the neighbors kids,
and hire a piano teacher.

554
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:30,160
My hands are full.

555
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,580
Good luck, Jack.

556
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:36,710
There's nothing harder
than being a good father.

557
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,710
Yeah.

558
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:41,260
Hey, thanks.

559
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,050
See you.

560
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:15,420
Come on now.

561
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,840
Hold it.

562
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,880
I'd like to use a stand
in for a rehearsal.

563
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,960
Ah, sorry, no.

564
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,470
Vencini insisted on Cinder.

565
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:25,840
They need proofs of the
money shot before Friday.

566
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,680
Let's have a talk.

567
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,730
This club has got
16-foot windows.

568
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:35,600
We put her in a fixed position
for more than an hour.

569
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,730
We might as well write
her name on the bullet.

570
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,610
He said he could guarantee it.

571
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,030
He said what?

572
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,360
Every building in range
has been locked down.

573
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,650
We got six units of NYPD.

574
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:48,070
You brought this job in.

575
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,910
But let's get one
thing straight--

576
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,580
this is my company.

577
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,370
It's also the biggest
contract you ever had.

578
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:55,920
They didn't hire Prototel.

579
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,880
They hired me.

580
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,710
So relax.

581
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,880
Fine.

582
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,220
She goes down-- you go down.

583
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,220
[music playing]

584
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,050

are you a bellboy?

587
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,380
MAN: Let them through.

588
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,250
Not here, from the other side.

589
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,130
Get out of the way here.

590
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,050
Come on!

591
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,130
Coming through.

592
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,130
[camera shutters]

593
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,220
Hey, moving through.
Come on.

594
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,140
Moving.

595
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,640
Get out of the way.

596
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,100
Let her through.

597
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,100
Move aside.

598
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,600
Move.

599
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,600
Yes, move.

600
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,390
Come on.

601
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,110
Through the door.

602
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,610
Move!

603
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:07,700
Move back.

604
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,570
Move.

605
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,360
Come on.

606
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,080
Just through the door.

607
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,460
[music playing]

608
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,020
Get down, sir.

00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:50,990
There he is!

612
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:51,990
Get him!

613
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,490
Get the shooter!

614
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:54,870

[gunfire]
Hold your fire!

617
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,170
Hold your fire!

618
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,630
Civilians!

00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:13,890
Get out of the way!

622
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,450
Add 1,000 milligrams
of ampicillin

623
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,070
to Mr. Hasting's IV stat.

624
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:32,820
Yes, sir.

625
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,420
Sorry, this is limited access.

626
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,220
I am here to see Tim Hastings.

627
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,970
OFFICER: Lieutenant?

628
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:54,890
It's OK.

629
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:55,930
I'll vouch for him.

630
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:58,060
Hey, Trini, how are you doing?

631
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,810
Sorry about your friend.

632
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,520
We've got two dead
from the apartment

633
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,480
where this guy took his first
shot, if it's the same guy.

634
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,110
I'm just here for Tim.

635
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,570
If you say so.

636
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:09,440
[beeping]

637
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,010
When he first
left the Marshals,

638
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,560
he thought by starting
his own company,

639
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,230
he'd finally be able to
protect the good ones.

640
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,730
Connie, listen--

641
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:46,860
No, listen, this is all
he's got right now, Jack.

642
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,570
The business-- do
you understand?

643
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,240
He trusts you, Jack.

644
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,950
JACK: I know, but
right now, I'm retired.

645
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,870
CONNIE: If that girl goes
down, the business is done.

646
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,000
Is that what you want
him to wake up to?

647
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,300
Connie, Tim came to me.

648
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,760
And it's kind of
hard to explain,

649
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,590
but I have a problem
with my vision right now.

650
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,340
I just don't feel ready.

651
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,220
TRAGLE: Devlin, what the
hell are you doing in here?

652
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,180
This is none of your business.

653
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,680
I can handle this.

654
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,270
CONNIE: The question is--
what are you doing here?

655
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:25,600
TRAGLE: I have some
business with Hastings.

656
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,940
What?

657
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,520
TRAGLE: I just need a signature.

658
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,480
The doctor said he
was semi-conscious.

659
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:36,320
[crash]

660
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:44,040
What happened?

661
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:44,830
JACK: The IV broke.

662
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:54,010
Potassium-- that
would have killed him.

663
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:55,840
[music playing]

664
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,620
Call Trini.

665
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,660
He needs more protection.

666
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,450
Got it.

667
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,090
I'm in.

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,040
Drugs are bad for you.

671
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:19,840
Did you know that?

672
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:27,470
Can you walk?

673
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:28,340
No, I can't--

674
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:31,810
I can't walk.

Let's go.

00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:56,060
Come on!

00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:20,750
I want to get something
straight, mister.

00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:21,620
Devlin.

682
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:22,920
Jack Devlin.

think you're going

684
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:27,710
to be able to come barging
in on me whenever you want.

685
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:31,470
As far as I'm concerned,
you're the hired help.

686
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:33,090
You're paid to do what I say.

687
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:35,180
Really?

688
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:38,640
My friend takes your
bullet, and you want to talk

689
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,190
to me about who's getting paid?

690
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:43,150
How is he?

691
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:45,650
He's in a coma.

692
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:48,400
I'm just here to help
them finish the job.

693
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,820
I'm so sorry.

694
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:51,400
No need to be sorry.

695
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,990
In our business, we're always
ready to take a bullet.

696
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:56,660
I just want to make sure I
didn't take it for nothing.

697
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:07,340
Now, listen, Cinder, we
need to work together.

698
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:11,630
I'll do my job, but you got
to take care of yourself.

699
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:15,050
You got it?

700
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:16,300
OK.

701
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,930
Got all your stuff now?

702
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:19,140
Yeah, I guess so.

703
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,020

we're moving.

00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:51,510
OK, our next plan--

00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:53,800
Don, please, can you
give us a few minutes?

00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,720
Sure.

Deploy the perimeter.

709
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:09,690
So is it true you're
not getting paid for this?

710
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:10,480
Pro bono.

711
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,150
Hold still.

712
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:20,200
Lumbar vertebrae, right?

713
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,000
I want arms up--

00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,670
palms touching the wall.

715
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:29,500
What is this?

716
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,630
Trust me, you'll like it.

717
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:33,380
Oh, no, there's
a disk problem.

718
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:35,340
Hold still.

719
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,640
What are you doing?

720
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,810
Finding your center.

721
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:48,350
OK, take a deep breath.

722
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:52,860
Hold it-- three, two, one--

723
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:53,860
[crack]
- Ah!

724
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:54,740
Ah!

725
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:55,820
Ah!
JACK: [groan]

726
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:56,610
Ah!

727
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,070
Ah!

728
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,160
The pain is gone.

729
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,330
Well, for an hour or so.

730
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:07,710
But I'll be back by then.

Do you have to leave now?

732
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:11,630
Look, there are two
ways to bodyguard.

733
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:14,920
You hide in a box like this and
wait for the threat to come.

734
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:19,050
Or you go out, and
find it, and stop it.

735
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:21,300
I'm a type A personality.

736
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,140
I hate to wait.

00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,070

CINDER (ON PHONE):
Honey, I'm sick.

740
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,840
I need my medicine.

741
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,090

baby, we've been over this.

742
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:52,130
CINDER (ON PHONE):
Just till Friday.

743
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:53,640
DEALER (ON PHONE): Where
is he keeping you, baby?

744
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:57,180
CINDER (ON PHONE): A
hotel in Dobbs Ferry,

745
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,220
the Hillcrest Bungalow 6.

746
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:00,600
DEALER (ON PHONE): All
right, I'll be there.

[music playing]

748
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:54,740
An hour ago when you said
that you would be home,

749
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:59,240
this was terrine of
braised veal Caprese.

750
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:03,450
Now, it is protein on a plate.

751
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:04,620
Bon appetit.

752
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:05,500
I'm sorry, Thomas.

753
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:12,260
I've been talking to Trini.

754
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,510
This guy fired
from a block away.

755
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:15,090
Mhm.

756
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,550
JACK: The bullet went through
half an inch of glass--

757
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,840
Aha.

758
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,470
A vase penetrated
2 inches into a wall

759
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:20,390
and then disappeared.

760
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:21,970
Mhm.

761
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:24,890
Well, to have that much
power, it must be an H&K. Huh?

762
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:27,270
Or maybe the projectile was--

763
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:29,110
carved ice or something.

764
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:31,020
JACK: Now, I want you to talk
to a couple of your buddies

765
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:33,150
in the Bodameinhov gang and
find out who is using them.

766
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,780
My buddies, yeah, if I
can get through to them,

767
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:35,820

00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:39,120
Welcome to Little Italy.

771
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,240
Isn't it great?

772
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,780
JACK: Yeah.

773
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:43,700
Thomas said I ran him
ragged and that he'd rather

774
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:44,660
be sucking sand in Morocco.

775
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:45,460
It's true.

You know, you don't
live alone anymore.

Hey, Casey, I'm sorry.

783
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:20,410
Say, um, I'm still
kind of new at this--

784
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:24,950
this uncle thing, and
um, this friend of mine

785
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:26,700

786
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:30,380
And he really needs my help.

787
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:32,380
You're not going to get
hurt, are you, Uncle Jack?

788

Yes, he is.

Big shot.

793
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,630
For you.

794
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:46,890

795
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,810
RACHEL: Jack, it's Dr. Stein.

796
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,230
You're half an hour
late for your session.

797
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:52,900
Are you still coming?

798
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,440
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

799
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,070
Something came up.

800
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:57,610
RACHEL (ON PHONE):
Something good, I hope.

801
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,240
JACK: Not really.

802
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,910
A friend of mine
asked me to do a job.

803
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:04,490
What kind of job?

804
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:05,830
JACK: Protection.

805
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:09,580
Cinder James, the supermodel.

806
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,870
Sounds dangerous.

807
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:13,580
Do you think you're ready?

808
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,000
He needs my help.

809
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,550
RACHEL (ON PHONE):
OK, I understand that.

810
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:20,220
But Jack, you need to
realize that your sunglasses

811
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:23,430
are the only protection you have
from all the white out there.

812
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:25,680
Thanks for the
vote of confidence.

813
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,180

[dial tone]

815
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:36,730
Hey, Thomas, why don't you
send her two dozen something?

816
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:37,610
Orchids.

817
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:39,240
Most women love them.

818
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,280
Orchids.

819
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,030
THOMAS: Two dozen orchids.

820
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:45,200
Why don't you just buy her a
Mercedes and get it over with?

821
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,410
Oh, yes, find two
dozens orchids.

822
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:47,330
I'll go to the bank.

823
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:49,830
We'll get orchids.

824
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:52,040
Casey, listen, I won't
be gone too long, OK?

825
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,710
We'll do something when
I get back, all right?

826
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:54,750
- OK.
- OK.

827
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:16,480
A man came by a few
minutes ago and left this.

828
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,270
Thanks.

829
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,500

- Are you serious?

830
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,120
What is this?

00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,460
She's had a visitor.

832
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:39,420
We've been blown.

833
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:45,470
You-- find some
heels and a dress.

834
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:47,930
You better grab a
ballistic blanket,

835
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:49,680
because you are the decoy.

836
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,770
Do I need to shave?

837
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:07,450
Now you know why
they pay us so much.

00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:09,080

00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,250
He'll think she's
in the stretch.

00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:16,710
You'll ride lead.

843
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,630
If there's any fire,
you'll break with the limo

01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:37,860

918
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:52,710
[groan]

919
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:56,170
[splash]

920
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:05,050
[groan]

921
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,520
[thud]

922
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:28,820
Looking for these.

923
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:29,620
Huh?

924
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:34,540
[groan]

925
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:37,040
[thud]

926
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:43,710
You're a disgrace.

927
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:45,090
What's the matter
with your eyes, Jack?

928
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:48,840
Huh?

929
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:49,850
[thud]

930
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:50,720
[splash]

931
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:57,310
Is it this?

932
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:58,060
Huh?

933
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,030
It's white, isn't it?

934
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:12,160
You're afraid of
the color white.

935
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,330
I'm lactose intolerant.

936
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:16,540
You think this is funny?

937
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:17,460
You think I'm funny?

938
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:18,290
[groan]

939
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:26,550
You think you're going to
protect Cinder from me?

940
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:30,010
You don't even have the
depth to understand her.

941
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:32,720
I'm protecting
her, not you, huh?

942
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:54,990
You have never seen her so
in pain she can't stand.

943
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:56,120
That one, I have seen.

944
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:07,920
RORY: How can you protect her
from me when all I want to do

945
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:08,670
is love her?

946
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:13,680
[tires squealing]

947
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:14,560
[gunfire]

948
01:06:16,930 --> 01:06:17,810
Go!

949
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:20,560
Get up there!

950
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,440
Go!

951
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:24,270
[groan]

952
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:28,110
What the hell happened to you?

953
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:31,410
I went swimming.

954
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:36,950
Thanks for helping me out.

955
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:37,950
Take care.

956
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:38,830
Goodnight.

957
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:50,970
Jack.

958
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:53,890
Getting some more of these?

959
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:55,680
The address is on the label.

960
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,060
And Dr. Feelgood ought
to be more careful.

961
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:00,060
Yeah, I'll be
sure to tell him.

962
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:02,190
It starts with the shivers--

963
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:04,190
then the cold shakes.

964
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:06,940
I know what you're
going through.

965
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:09,360
I was a user once too.

966
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:13,240
It's powerful stuff,
but not worth dying for.

967
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:15,070
Save it for someone who cares.

968
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:17,950
If I can find you, so can
your friend with a rifle.

969
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:18,700
I'll take my chances.

970
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,210
All right, suit yourself.

971
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:24,880
Take enough of that
junk, and maybe when

972
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,630
your friends bullet rips
the back of your head off,

973
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:29,420
you won't even notice.

974
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:38,180
All right, Cinder,
let's have the goodies.

975
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,230
What about your backup?

976
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:47,810
I don't know what
you're talking about.

977
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:49,190
You're a junkie, sweetheart.

978
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,940
You're leaving for Paris.

979
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:52,860
You would have asked
for a little extra.

980
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,950
I don't have to
put up with this.

981
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:56,320
JACK: No, you don't.

982
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,410
But it's my way or the
highway, you got it?

983
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:06,290
You know, you're
a real wet blanket.

984
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:07,710
Hey, just think--

985
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:11,210
if somebody would have
done this for Elvis,

986
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:13,550
he'd still be doing tacky
lounge shows and in Vegas.

987
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:25,060
Go ahead.

988
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:26,190
How much were you using?

989
01:08:26,190 --> 01:08:30,360
325-- for a day.

990
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,360
Well, that's determination.

991
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:42,290
[beeping]

992
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:49,040
This is Jack.
Can you come to my place?

993
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:53,670
Oh, god, OK, what's going on?
Who is that?

994
01:08:53,670 --> 01:08:54,630
The model?

995
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:55,970
Dr. Stein is on the way.

996
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:00,640
She looks, uh, sick.

997
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:06,770
All right, get her warm.

998
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:12,270
Good.

999
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:13,320
There you go.

1000
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:14,280
JACK: This is my friend, Thomas.

1001
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,650
Hello.

1002
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:16,860
Ah, you're in good hands now.

1003
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:17,610
You'll be all right.

1004
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,990
Is this your
girlfriend, Uncle Jack?

1005
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:24,950
No.

1006
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:26,250
She's very sick.

1007
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:32,840
You'll be OK.

1008
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:33,750
This is Max.

1009
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:34,960
I'm Casey.

1010
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:35,710
Hi, Casey.

1011
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:44,100
Ah.

1012
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:48,020
D-- Dr. Stein?

1013
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:50,850
OK, where's the fire?

1014
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:53,320
Ah.

1015
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:54,070
Down here.

1016
01:09:57,490 --> 01:09:58,400
This had better be good.

1017
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:03,780
Thanks for coming.

1018
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:09,540
This way.

1019
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:11,080
Is this your
girlfriend, Uncle Jack?

1020
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,000
No, honey.

1021
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,340
I'm his doctor.

1022
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:15,130
You must be Casey.
- Uh-huh.

1023
01:10:15,130 --> 01:10:16,050
Nice to meet you.

1024
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:19,380
Nice to meet you too.

1025
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:21,930
And this Jack is part of
the work you're doing.

1026
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:29,850
She's coming down off a
Percodan habit of $1,300 a day.

1027
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:31,480
Think you can help?

1028
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,730
Yeah, but first I need to
get her out of those clothes

1029
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:34,770
and back into bed.

1030
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:35,900
Casey, would you give me a hand?

1031
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:36,690
Sure.

1032
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:41,570
I think we girls
can handle this.

1033
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:50,710
Why don't you boys go and make
yourselves useful by boiling

1034
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:51,960
some water or something?

1035
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:03,720
I don't like being
patronized and dismissed.

1036
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:04,970
Thanks for coming, Dr. Stein.

1037
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:05,970
My pleasure.

1038
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:08,140
And you can call me Rachel.

1039
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:10,930
By the way, I was on a
date at the test center

1040
01:11:10,930 --> 01:11:12,770
and I'm billing you
for this house call.

1041
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:14,100
Absolutely.

1042
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:21,990
Thank you for the flowers.

1043
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,460
What did I do before you came?

1044
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:37,880
Probably made a
lot of ladies mad.

1045
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:47,260
[music playing]

1046
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:03,740
CINDER: Tell me about Jack.

1047
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:06,070
THOMAS: His father
was a gambler.

1048
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:08,200
He had a photographic memory.

1049
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,410
He was one of the first
card counters in Vegas.

1050
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:14,830
And his mother-- ah, his
mother-- well, one night, she

1051
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:16,460
ran off with a guitar player.

1052
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:17,830
He never saw her again.

1053
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:18,750
CINDER: Really?

1054
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:20,130
That's awful.

1055
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:21,460
THOMAS: No, what was
awful was that guitar

1056
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:24,760
player couldn't play a note.

1057
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,340
And after that, Jack
and his father--

1058
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:30,850
they hit the road in
a 1962 white caddy.

1059
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:32,140
He went from town
to town, you know,

1060
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,480
because he was always winning.

1061
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,190
He was black booked
in all the casinos.

1062
01:12:35,190 --> 01:12:38,360
So they would hit Atlantic
City and the Bahamas.

1063
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:42,070
Whenever the house got wise to
him, the father had a signal.

1064
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:44,440
He would flick his
light at once, twice,

1065
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:47,360
and that was the signal for
Jack to go get the caddy ready.

1066
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,990
One night, that lighter--

1067
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:51,490
it didn't work.

1068
01:12:51,490 --> 01:12:56,370
So Jack missed his cue.

1069
01:12:56,370 --> 01:12:58,040
What happened?

1070
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,500
THOMAS: Some mob guys-- they
grabbed him before he left.

1071
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:04,420
They found the
body in the desert.

1072
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:06,090
That's horrible.

1073
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,550
And after he
buried his father,

1074
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:08,760
and he paid off all his markers.

1075
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:13,140
All that was left
was that lighter--

1076
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:14,850
an old Zippo.

1077
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:15,930
CINDER: So how'd
he get to New York?

1078
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:21,770
THOMAS: Ah, well, his
grandmother was here--

1079
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:23,020
came to live with her.

1080
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:23,980
You know, she was
a very nice lady.

1081
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:26,320
She cleaned houses.

1082
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:30,990
She's the one who gave him
his code that he lives by.

1083
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:33,700
And what's that?

1084
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:37,290
He is slow to make a promise.

1085
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:38,160
But he's quick to keep it.

1086
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,550
Is this the DMV?

1087
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:45,960
My name is Rory Gaines,
and I'm stuck out here

1088
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:49,510
in a rental place
in New York City.

1089
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:52,890
You know how unfriendly the
people are in New York City.

1090
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:56,470
I know.

1091
01:13:56,470 --> 01:13:59,850
Anyway, so someone
pilfered my wallet,

1092
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:02,230
and I've lost my damn
driver's license.

1093
01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:04,650
So I was wondering if
you could fax me a copy

1094
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:06,400
so I could rent a car and
drive to a police station

1095
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,190
and report this.

1096
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:12,660
You are too kind.

1097
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:13,780
I just wish I was home.

1098
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:18,460
Anything on those
vanishing rounds?

1099
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:19,870
Yes.

1100
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:22,000
It looks like it's
a CD-- a Controlled

1101
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,960
Disintegration device.

1102
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,340
It explodes on impact.

1103
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:27,460
It's impossible to
trace the origins.

1104
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:28,630
Well, who makes them?

1105
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:30,550
Mhm.

1106
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:32,340
Well, my friends at
Baader-Meinof that--

1107
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:33,600
Oh, you got through?

1108
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,970
THOMAS: Oh, yeah,
you have no idea.

1109
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,510
Don't ask.

1110
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:37,850
Anyway, they told me there's
a guy on Long Island.

1111
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:39,680
His name is Ghide Sinno.

1112
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:43,650
This man apparently is an
expert in weapons technology.

1113
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:49,240
And if the price is right,
he's also into teaching.

1114
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:53,990
Well, if it is who
I think, this guy

1115
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,410
has got plenty of cash.

1116
01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:56,330
Yeah, where are you going?

1117
01:14:56,330 --> 01:14:57,330
You know it's late.

1118
01:14:57,330 --> 01:14:59,160
You have to get some sleep.

1119
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,330
I can't.

1120
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:05,040
This guy spilled milk on me.

1121
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:05,840
Cinder?

1122
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:12,720
We have to talk.
- Why?

1123
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:13,720
What's wrong?

1124
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:18,010
You've been holding back.

1125
01:15:20,730 --> 01:15:22,980
No, that's not true.

1126
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:24,730
Well, I just checked
your bank account.

1127
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:26,560
You've been wiring
money to Arkansas--

1128
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:27,360
thousands of dollars.

1129
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:32,700
It's for my sister.

1130
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:34,110
She's dead.

1131
01:15:34,110 --> 01:15:35,820
She died in a bus wreck in '89.

1132
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:36,700
That's how you hurt your back.

1133
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,010
There's no time for that now.

1134
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:53,800
Come on.

1135
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,260
This guy knows you.

1136
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:57,220
He's obsessed.

1137
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,760
Now, I can't protect you
if I don't know the truth.

1138
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:06,190
Jenny was the one that was
supposed to be here, not me.

1139
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:10,780
It's all she ever wanted.

1140
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:17,370
She took tap.

1141
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:20,240
She went to beauty school.

1142
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:23,580
She even starved herself
till she was sick.

1143
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:24,620
[sigh]

1144
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:26,370
That's what this is all about?

1145
01:16:26,370 --> 01:16:29,880
You doing all this
for your sister.

1146
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:32,380
Oh, at first maybe.

1147
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:35,260
But then I found out
I was good at it.

1148
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:36,930
I've never been good
at anything in my life.

1149
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,890
And now I'm this
close to making it.

1150
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:43,680
I'm scared.

1151
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:52,980
Cinder.

1152
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:06,580
Jack, I have a tummy ache.

1153
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:11,880
What did you have for dinner?

1154
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:15,840
Pizza, licorice,
cream soda, and pickles.

1155
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,590
Thomas let you eat that.

1156
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:19,220
No, we ordered out.

1157
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:21,470
No wonder you are sick.

1158
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:24,140
Cinder?

1159
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,060
Here.

1160
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:28,020
OK.

1161
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:31,060
All right.

1162
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:32,980
OK, I am going to
have to go in that.

1163
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:34,690
Yeah, go get her.

1164
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:35,440
OK.

1165

01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:17,530
I love you.

01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:18,280
Cinder.

1169
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:27,750
I love-- I love you.

CINDER: You and I aren't
meant to be together.

1171
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:37,710
So kill me if you want.

01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:49,180
Jack.

01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:53,770
JACK Come on, Cinder.

1175
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:54,560
Let's get in the car.

1176
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:06,240
Who are you running from?

1177
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:07,790
What do you care?

1178
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:11,250
Obviously, you're
just doing your job.

1179
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:12,960
What first?

1180
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:13,750
Now.

1181
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:17,670
What?

1182
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:27,600
I just don't want
to see you get hurt.

1183
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:28,390
Is that all?

1184
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:33,020
What do you want from me?

1185
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:35,230
The truth.

1186
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:37,190
If you think you can run away
from shadows your whole life,

1187
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:39,480
you're wrong.
- No, no, I just--

1188
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:40,940
Come on, Cinder.

1189
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:42,360
You know who the
shooter is, don't you?

1190
01:19:45,070 --> 01:19:45,820
Yes.

1191
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:51,370
It's my ex-husband.

1192

[music playing]

1193
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:04,010
Do thou but close our
hands in holy words.

1194
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:06,880
I say there will be
no more marriages.

1195
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:10,300
And therefore, since I
cannot prove a lover--

1196
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:14,310
oh, my fond love thus
do I blow to heaven.

1197
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:21,610
Oh, love, thy crown and hearted
throne to tyrannous hate!

Oh, blood!

Blood!

01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:48,050
Rory Gaines married
Cinder when she was 16.

1203
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:48,970
What?

1204
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:50,840
The supermodel?

1205
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:52,050
She's your client?

1206
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:53,430
Christ, Jack.

1207
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:54,720
They just fall into
your lap, don't they?

1208
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,020
The guy is Caucasian--

1209
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:59,230
6' 4", 200 pounds,
no criminal record.

1210
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:02,190
The word on the street says
he's been training with weapons.

1211
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:05,110
This guy's a failed
actor gone haywire.

1212
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:07,820
He's a basic obsessed,
wife-beating ex-husband.

1213
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:11,160
The guy is complete
letters, stalking,

1214
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:13,070
blackmail, and murder.

1215
01:21:13,070 --> 01:21:14,120
Blackmail?

1216
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,030
The guy was an actor.

1217
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:16,330
He couldn't get a job.

1218
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:18,450
His wife made it big.

1219
01:21:18,450 --> 01:21:19,660
She paid him off
for the divorce--

1220
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:21,790
couldn't pay him
enough to get lost.

1221
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:24,540
Then Vencini makes
the announcement.

1222
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:28,880
So Rory figured if he couldn't
have her, no one could.

1223
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,430
No where to find him?

1224
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:34,100
Soon.

1225
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:38,600
Well, I could put
out an APB on him.

1226
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,270
Talk to Vincini.

1227
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:43,650
Make sure they call off the
show until we nail this guy.

1228
01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:44,400
I'll try my best.

1229
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:56,280
What does this mean?

1230
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:59,500
It means she stays inside,
under guard, 24 hours a day

1231
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:00,750
until we get him.

1232
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:02,330
The announcement is tomorrow.

1233
01:22:02,330 --> 01:22:04,630
If Vencini finds out,
they'll drop her in a second.

1234
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:06,670
You haven't told them yet?

1235
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:09,630
That's why Tragle
is still on the job?

1236
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:11,260
You two cut a deal.

1237
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,430
I'm protecting my client.

1238
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:16,220
We're surrounded by
40-story buildings.

1239
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:17,760
He has 1,000 places to hide.

1240
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,350
This guy could be anywhere.

1241
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:20,890
I'm telling you
she'll be nowhere

1242
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:22,230
if she doesn't make this deal.

1243
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,280
You say you're good
at damage control?

1244
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:36,370
Just trust me.

1245
01:22:36,370 --> 01:22:38,700
Devlin is history.

1246
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:40,830
How much is this
going to cost?

1247
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:43,670
There's an outstanding loan
at Prototel that has come due.

1248
01:22:43,670 --> 01:22:46,380
At the moment, the
company hasn't any value.

1249
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:49,710
With a partner that's
liquid, I can take it.

1250
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:52,420
You scratch my back, I'll
scratch yours, buddy.

1251
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:53,220
Deal.

1252
01:22:55,890 --> 01:22:57,180

1253
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:58,930
JACK: I'm going to
see the weapons guy.

1254
01:22:58,930 --> 01:23:02,520
Now, how were you planning to
get the information out of him?

1255
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:03,810
You are going to use a weapon?

1256
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:05,690
Yeah, you are going
to intimidate him.

1257
01:23:05,690 --> 01:23:07,270
That's very boring,
you know, Jack.

1258
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:08,360
Well, what are
you going to do?

1259
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:09,650
Talk him to death?

1260
01:23:09,650 --> 01:23:10,400

seen him before?

You don't want to know who I am.

1273
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:10,920
You don't want to
know why I'm here.

1274
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,670
So [speaking italian].

1275
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:16,090
And I tell you right now, you
don't want to meet my family--

1276
01:24:16,090 --> 01:24:18,050
mi familia.

1277
01:24:18,050 --> 01:24:21,640
You understand
what I said to you?

1278
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,010
Ah, he's going to be nice now.

1279
01:24:23,010 --> 01:24:24,640
He's understanding.

1280
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:26,140
We know you are
the best manufacturer

1281
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:27,440
of customized ammunition.

1282
01:24:32,230 --> 01:24:33,730
We know you helped this guy.

1283
01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:35,990
Look, I am an immigrant.

1284
01:24:35,990 --> 01:24:37,530
I just got my green card.

1285
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:38,570
I don't need help.

1286
01:24:38,570 --> 01:24:39,950
Oh, we don't care about you.

1287
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:41,320
Oh, we don't care
about immigration.

1288
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:42,990
We just want to get
this guy off the street.

1289
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:44,040
That's it.

1290
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:46,080
He ordered a couple of things.

1291
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,830
And, uh--

1292
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:49,330
And what?

1293
01:24:49,330 --> 01:24:51,500
And gave me a telephone
number where I can reach

1294
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:55,340
him just in case [inaudible].

1295
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:56,210
This is uh--

1296
01:25:02,850 --> 01:25:04,850
Good luck.

1297
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:06,600
And, uh, congratulations
for your green card.

1298
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:07,930
Thank you.
That's very nice.

1299
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:09,100
Good.
Thank you.

1300
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:10,020
Thank you very much.

1301
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:10,770
Thank you.

1302
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:16,440
JACK: 212
THOMAS: 212.

1303
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:17,690
JACK: 555.
THOMAS: 555.

1304
01:25:17,690 --> 01:25:18,610
JACK: 0199.

1305
01:25:18,610 --> 01:25:20,860
THOMAS: 0199.

1306
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:22,740
What time do we have to
pick up Casey from school?

1307
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:23,990
In about an hour.

1308
01:25:23,990 --> 01:25:25,410
We're not going to
make it, you know?

1309
01:25:25,410 --> 01:25:26,790
We're going to be late.
- Well, somebody has to.

1310
01:25:26,790 --> 01:25:27,700
Well, it's not going
to be me, obviously.

1311
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:29,120
I'm working here.

1312
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:30,370
What is that high-priced
psychiatrist of yours

1313
01:25:30,370 --> 01:25:31,540
doing besides
screwing up your head

1314
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:32,920
and taking your money, huh?

1315
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:34,630
Why don't you have
her do something?

1316
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:35,960
- Well, that's a good idea.
- Of course it's a good idea.

1317
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:37,380
All right, here's this.
Look, look, look.

1318
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:39,550
800 West 45th Street.
You know what that is?

1319
01:25:39,550 --> 01:25:40,970
That's the distillery building.

1320
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:43,140
The Aramore Distillery
right off Times Square.

1321
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:45,430
OK, let's get out of here.
Let's go.

1322
01:25:45,430 --> 01:25:46,350
All right?

1323
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:47,680
Hi, Rachel.

1324
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,520
Are you busy?

1325
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:52,310
He's on his way.

1326
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:54,270
And he's got a friend with him.

1327
01:25:54,270 --> 01:25:56,150
[music playing]

1328
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:30,950
[gunfire]

1329
01:27:41,170 --> 01:27:41,960
Thomas?

1330
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:47,640
Thomas, you all right?

1331
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:49,010
Yeah, listen,
you think next time

1332
01:27:49,010 --> 01:27:50,600
you can aim a little higher?

1333
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:53,020
The guy is taller than
me by about a foot.

1334
01:27:53,020 --> 01:27:54,350
I'm sorry, pal.

1335
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:55,850
Ah, ah!
[thud]

1336
01:27:55,850 --> 01:27:56,730
[groan]

1337
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,150
[music playing]

1338
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:34,390
I haven't had an
audience in so long.

1339
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:58,830
One of these heads is
not like the other.

1340
01:28:58,830 --> 01:29:01,750
Where-- is--

1341
01:29:06,130 --> 01:29:07,050
Thomas?

1342
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:07,880
[gunshot]

1343
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:14,390
You don't have to do this.

1344
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:17,640
Where-- is--

1345
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:23,020
Thomas?

1346
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:23,860
[gunshot]

1347
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:28,900
Please, stop.

1348
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:31,160
Come on, Rory.

1349
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:32,910
You know you've won already.

1350
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:34,580
Come on, Jack.

1351
01:29:34,580 --> 01:29:35,660
Come on!

1352
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:37,330
You're better than me.

1353
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:38,750
Stronger.

1354
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:39,910
Where's Thomas?

1355
01:29:39,910 --> 01:29:40,790
[gunshots]

1356
01:29:42,290 --> 01:29:44,420
Whatever you want,
I'll give it to you--

1357
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:45,460
anything.

1358
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:46,880
Anything you want-- just stop!

1359
01:29:50,470 --> 01:29:52,090
You know what you are?

1360
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:56,510
You're nothing--
nothing to nobody.

1361
01:29:56,510 --> 01:29:58,220
Nobody hears you.

1362
01:29:58,220 --> 01:30:00,390
Nobody sees you.

1363
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:06,440
What gives you the
right to look down on me?

1364
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:09,740
You don't know how I feel.

1365
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:12,700
You've never been a nobody!

1366
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:15,200
You've never been ignored!

1367
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:16,950
You've never been
humiliated on stage.

1368
01:30:22,710 --> 01:30:26,380
Where-- is--

1369
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:27,340
Thomas!

1370
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:28,710
[clicking]

1371
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:32,800
[scream]

1372
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:33,760
Where is Thomas?

1373
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:36,260
Where?

1374
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:37,220
You tell me!

1375
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:38,220
Where?

1376
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:41,180
Where is he?

1377
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:44,730
Here is Thomas, you bastard.

1378
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:47,690
You haven't lived the
years of rejection--

1379
01:30:47,690 --> 01:30:50,730
been deserted by everyone.

1380
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:52,700
Anyone I cared
about betrayed me.

1381
01:31:00,740 --> 01:31:03,120
Oh, my god.

1382
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,170
My face.

1383
01:31:04,170 --> 01:31:05,080
You're dead, Jack.

1384
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:14,130
Die and be damned, Jack!

1385
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:23,350
[groaning] oh, Thomas.

1386
01:31:23,350 --> 01:31:24,690
Thomas.
Oh.

1387
01:31:24,690 --> 01:31:25,690
You OK?

1388
01:31:25,690 --> 01:31:27,860
I-- I've never been better.

1389
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:28,860
How about you?

1390
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:30,020
Not too good.

1391
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:31,070
Yeah, well, you
need more therapy,

1392
01:31:31,070 --> 01:31:34,150
you know, that's the problem.

1393
01:31:34,150 --> 01:31:37,820
Rachel, this white thing--

1394
01:31:37,820 --> 01:31:40,410
I've got to get past it.

1395
01:31:40,410 --> 01:31:43,080
You have to give me something--
a devise, technique,

1396
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:46,120
to break this thing.

1397
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:51,800
Because if I don't beat
it, they'll kill her.

1398
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:53,420
RACHEL: I don't know
if this will help,

1399
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:58,300
but my philosophy teacher
used to say, it is written--

1400
01:31:58,300 --> 01:32:00,510
there's a time and a place
when we all have to go.

1401
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:07,850
I'm not afraid to die.

1402
01:32:07,850 --> 01:32:11,230
RACHEL: But you are
afraid of losing control.

1403
01:32:11,230 --> 01:32:13,360
And you feel responsible
for your father's

1404
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:16,990
death and the attack on Casey.

1405
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:19,280
I was responsible.

1406
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:21,910
You had no control
over either event.

1407
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:26,000
You're not at fault.

1408
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,670
But yet, the lighter was set.

1409
01:32:28,670 --> 01:32:32,090
I should've known he was
trying to signal me--

1410
01:32:32,090 --> 01:32:33,170
even without the flames.

1411
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:38,300
Jack, it was
your father's time.

1412
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:44,310
What this is about
is understanding

1413
01:32:44,310 --> 01:32:47,140
that you can't do it all.

1414
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:51,230
All you can do when the
moment comes is your best.

1415
01:32:51,230 --> 01:32:52,110
My best.

1416
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:13,170
Can't sleep.

1417
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:20,010
It's OK to cry, you see?

1418
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:21,930
It's OK.

1419
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:23,800
I cry a lot at night.

1420
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:24,890
I miss them.

1421
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:35,270
I cry sometimes.

1422
01:33:35,270 --> 01:33:37,820
I lost my parents
when I was young too.

1423
01:33:42,620 --> 01:33:48,120
But every day, I
looked up, and I know

1424
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:51,370
they're watching from heaven.

1425
01:33:51,370 --> 01:33:52,370
Wow!

1426
01:33:52,370 --> 01:33:53,170
Really?

1427
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:58,260
Does that mean mommy saw me
take the candy out of the dish

1428
01:33:58,260 --> 01:33:59,840
on the coffee table?

1429
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,220
That was you.

1430
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:02,130
I'm sorry.

1431
01:34:02,130 --> 01:34:02,930
Max was hungry.

1432
01:34:05,470 --> 01:34:08,140
Yeah, Max is like that.

1433
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:11,770
You know, you can't
always listen to him.

1434
01:34:11,770 --> 01:34:12,690
You can listen to this--

1435
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:17,400
and this.

1436
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:23,280
OK.

1437
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,240
I love you, Casey.

1438
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:26,450
I love you too, Uncle Jack.

1439
01:34:41,090 --> 01:34:42,300
22 Bravo to Echo.

1440
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:43,090
Clear for pick up.

1441
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:48,310
Cinder.

1442
01:34:48,310 --> 01:34:50,220
Don't go.
- Jack, come on.

1443
01:34:50,220 --> 01:34:51,730
I'll be on a plane in six hours.

1444
01:34:51,730 --> 01:34:52,980
Do you think
this guy will stop?

1445
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:53,940
If he doesn't do it--

1446
01:34:53,940 --> 01:34:54,980
Relax.

1447
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:56,690
[inaudible]

1448
01:34:56,690 --> 01:34:58,650
The window is all covered in
Mylar, so he won't have a shot.

1449
01:34:58,650 --> 01:34:59,650
Now, let's ride.

1450

It's a note on the company.

Don't pretend like it's

You just want to feed your
measly, lonely, little ego.

You're a failure because
you made yourself a failure.

You can't act, because
you're not even human.

You have no sympathy-- no
regard for other people's lives.
