00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,879
Queer! Queer! Queer!

3
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,100
Welcome to another talk from the Alan
Watts radio series. Here is Alan Watts.

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,100
The physical world is transient.

5
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,859
It's impermanent.

6
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,580
It falls apart.

7
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,559
And bodies that were once strong,

8
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,229
smooth and lovely in youth

9
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,974
begin to wither and become corrupt

10
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,800
and turn at last into skeletons.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,980
To the degree that you identify yourself with the body.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,600
And with the pleasures of the body.

13
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,100
To that degree, you are simply going to be something

14
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,799
that is sucked away

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,700
in the course of transiency.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,400
So therefore hold yourself up aloof.

17
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,419
Keep your mind like a mirror.

18
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,219
Pure and clean.

19
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,399
Free from dust, free from flaws, free from stain.

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,499
And just reflect everything that goes on.

21
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,100
But don't be attached.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,820
You are a rational soul

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,466
in charge of an animal body.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,100
If you belong to the old fashion school

25
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,100
you beat it into the measure.

26
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,519
Fuck.

27
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,300
Fucker!

28
00:01:53,301 --> 00:01:54,700
That's the pole set.

29
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,999
I beat my body...

30
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,899
into submission.

31
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,503
Really...?

32
00:02:12,504 --> 00:02:13,602
Is that good?

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,999
Uh..

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,400
Yeah.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,300
There goes your B& F.                          (Boyfriend and Fuck)

36
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:21,919
Fuck you, man.

37
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,018
Hey!

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,600
Is it still a good time?

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,400
Yes.

40
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,300
I'm concerned about a student.

41
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,100
Phil Patterson.

42
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,197
Yeah, I know them.

43
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,200
I came across some things that have me worried.

44
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,539
He is struggling to come to terms with his
sexuality.

45
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,899
It's obvious from... what he's writing.

46
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,100
I see first-hand how the kids are teasing him.

47
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,000
Well... He is a good kid on paper.

48
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
He is on the honor roll.

49
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,200
He's got great grades.

50
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,819
This isn't about his grades.

51
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,239
You need to read some of these.

52
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,199
Look.

53
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,499
I wanna get Phil an appointment to see a school psychologist.

54
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,400
I want him in front of someone who has some experience.

55
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,900
Please. Just call.

56
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,500
Janus.

57
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,600
The Roman God of Beginnings and Endings.

58
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,000
He is two-faced.

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,250
One face sees the past.

60
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,000
And the other face sees the future.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I want you to write about an important event

62
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,000
that marked a transition in your life.

63
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,100
You'll need to demonstrate how it was influenced
by your past

64
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,560
and how it  affected your future.

65
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,400
Ok?

66
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,899
You have forty minutes.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You may begin.

68
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,400
Who is that?

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,100
My uncle.

70
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,800
Shab.

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,900
You don't have to whisper.

72
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,000
He's pretty out of it.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,300
So... what are we doing here?

74
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,932
Which one is he?

75
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,400
That guy.

76
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,000
He look so young there.

77
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:53,000
What do you think?

78
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
I don't know.

79
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,919
I mean. I would say.

80
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,599
I guess it depends on the guy.

81
00:05:57,749 --> 00:06:00,229
A guy can't really choose who you falling in love with you know.

82
00:06:00,749 --> 00:06:03,088
It kind of just happens.

83
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:03,600
I mean I've never been in love, but...

84
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,600
Writing the dissertation?

85
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
I just want make it good.

86
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,500
So... Have you given any thought to
 attending
that group we talked about?

87
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,178
Uh...yeah.

88
00:06:45,178 --> 00:06:47,360
I don't know.

89
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:47,977
All right.

90
00:06:47,977 --> 00:06:49,888
They're meeting tonight at six.

91
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,400
If you free I think you really enjoy it.

92
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,458
Ok.

93
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:53,888
Good.

94
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:55,260
Wrap up and go home!

95
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,000
Ok.

96
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,600
I wish we give Adam a ride.

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,250
Mom! No!

98
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,500
Why not?

99
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,455
Please! We're not friends.

100
00:07:38,455 --> 00:07:38,955
Let's go. Come on.

101
00:07:38,955 --> 00:07:40,700
Hi Adam.

102
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,000
You like a ride?

103
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,700
Ummm...My brother's coming soon.

104
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Ok. Take care of yourself.

105
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,500
Where were you this evening?

106
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,100
Out.

107
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,500
A girl Phil?

108
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,000
No.

109
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,700
Why were you late?

110
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,699
Sit at the park.

111
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,200
Mike lives there you know.

112
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,600
Michael.

113
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,040
Mom's brother.

114
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,929
Do you talk to him.

115
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:55,605
I think we should move on

116
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,500
with the conversation.

117
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,700
He cannot take care of himself.

118
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,600
We cannot take care of him.

119
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,000
Your mother and I discussed this.

120
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,600
He's right.

121
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,860
We are all...

122
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,440
falling apart

123
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,000
in some way or another.

124
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,000
Especially after you... passed the peak of youth.

125
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The very fact you see that the world is

126
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
always decaying and always falling away

127
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
is the same thing as its vitality.

128
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,000
Vitality is change. Life is death.

129
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
It is always falling apart.

130
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Hey...

131
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What the fuck!

132
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,000
Get off!

133
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,760
When it comes to... love, sexuality...

134
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,000
Timing is the essence.

135
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,600
That's real little bitch.

136
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,800
Don't you keep your head still.

137
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,400
I don't wanna mess it up.

138
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,000
but that's not something that one should
look upon with regret.

139
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,440
It only is something regrettable.

140
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,962
If you didn't know how to take it when it was time.

141
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Can you knock, knock?

142
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,960
Because it is after all through sexuality

143
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,100
that we have our most fundamental relationship to nature.

144
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And it is the point at which we can become most attached.

145
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,000
There is no way of making a heads grow

146
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,489
like pruning it.

147
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,547
Why are you wearing lipstick?

148
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,100
It was not me.

149
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,500
Sexuality is something which you cannot get rid off.

150
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,000
Do what you may.

151
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,000
Life... is sexual.

152
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,200
Fucking pissing me off.

153
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,553
He's always staring in.

154
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:09,053
Are you friends with him?

155
00:12:09,053 --> 00:12:10,700
You really think I'm friends with them?

156
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,353
All right.

157
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,800
Faggot!

158
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,159
Hey Phil.

159
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,689
Oh my God!

160
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,300
Where you going?

161
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,400
Phil!

162
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,622
Hey.

163
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,400
Mike!

164
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,200
Mike

165
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,800
Welcome to another talk from the
Alan Watts radio series. Here is Alan Watts.

166
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,500
We get a hangup

167
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,773
on all the various things

168
00:14:22,773 --> 00:14:24,300
that we're told as we grow up,

169
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
by our parents, our aunts and uncles,

170
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,000
our teachers.

171
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,500
Above all by our peer group.

172
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,160
A lot of the parent quest for identity

173
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,180
among younger people

174
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,000
is a search for

175
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,680
an acceptable image.

176
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,000
What role can I play?

177
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,300
And the first date

178
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,180
that everybody wants to tell us

179
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,100
is the difference between ourselves

180
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,800
and the rest of the world.

181
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,700
Make sure we get his toothpaste and toothbrush.

182
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,000
The cell phone should be charged too.

183
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,300
Uh...

184
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,000
This guy at school I really liked.

185
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,945
I guess he was afraid of...

186
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,900
you know. Finding out something.

187
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,400
And...

188
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
and so he started picking on me

189
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,900
It got pretty bad and uh...

190
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,500
Three years ago, I just felt like...

191
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Everything was...

192
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,500
like nothing was there.

193
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,460
Like there's no hope at all.

194
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,500
So I tried to kill myself.

195
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,200
But I'm climbing back up from that hole.

196
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,700
And it's good you know that I'm not alone.

197
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,457
I can never get to look at me.

198
00:17:43,457 --> 00:17:45,000
The real me.

199
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,880
It's always behind.

200
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,400
It's always hidden.

201
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,794
And so... if you are perfectly honest
about
 loving yourself.

202
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,000
And you don't pull any punches.

203
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,000
You don't pretend that you were

anything other than exactly what you are.

204
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,900
If you can do that, you have no further problem.
