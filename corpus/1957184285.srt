[ticks loudly]

3
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:57,700
Can I help you?

4
00:00:58,867 --> 00:00:59,567
Hi.

5
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:02,167
I think
I'm supposed to work here today.

6
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:10,133
Sit here until someone comes
and tells you what to do.

7
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,733
You can read this
while you're waiting.

8
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,600
[soft music]

9
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,233
[woman]
Oh, my feet are killing me.

10
00:01:53,067 --> 00:01:54,067
Who's the new girl?

11
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,733
[woman 2]
Must be filling in for someone.

12
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,067
[clock ticking]

13
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:20,233
I can't believe you've
been waiting for two hours.

14
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,867
Why didn't you say something?

15
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:25,767
They um,
they told me to wait here.

16
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:29,267
Well, I hope you can type.
Follow me.

17
00:02:32,467 --> 00:02:33,867
Okay.

18
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:38,600
Type the information from
this list onto the invoice form

19
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:39,733
and then when you're done,

20
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,667
you will make
three copies of each

21
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,500
and the copy room
is down the hall.

22
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,367
Um, try not to make
too many mistakes.

23
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:50,433
These forms are very expensive.

24
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:57,333
[typing]

25
00:02:57,967 --> 00:03:01,100
[soft, upbeat music]

26
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:27,333

00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:26,300
[machine whirring]

32
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:34,067
Hi. Um, you know what?

33
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:35,700
This machine
isn't working very well.

34
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:36,667
You better use that one.

35
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:41,233
[machine whirring]

36
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:54,300
Damn, you know, I think

37
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:56,433
someone put a curse on it,
it just keeps jamming.

38
00:04:57,633 --> 00:04:58,467
All right.

39
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:04,267
Excuse me...

40
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:12,100
[employees chattering]

41
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,233
[soft music]

42
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:31,667
You know, if you--
if you hit it evenly,

43
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,233
and put pressure down,
it like, doesn't smear that way.

44
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,467
It works better.

45
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:37,467
And if you, when you're done,
would you close it,

46
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:39,200
because they dry up really fast.

47
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,533
I like your shoes.

48
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:50,367
[music continues]

49
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,567
[Iris] <i>I once read</i>
there are two kinds of time,</i>

50
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:12,667
<i>mechanical and human.</i>

51
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:15,600
<i>You could say</i>
my story began at 8:59,</i>

52
00:06:15,767 --> 00:06:17,267
<i>the day I started that job,</i>

53
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:19,900
<i>and ended months later</i>
when I left it.</i>

54
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:22,433
<i>But I'd tell you</i>
it began in the past</i>

55
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,633
<i>with my old self and ended</i>
in the future, with a new one.</i>

56

57
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,100
[phone ringing]

58
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:14,233
Hello?

59
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:18,733
Uh, I'm not sure.

60
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,767
I'm just a temp. Could you
please hold on, please?

61
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,133
[music continues]

62
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,067
Um, he's kind of busy right now.

63
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:37,433
May I take a message?

64
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:39,933
Uh-huh.

65
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:41,967
Yeah.

66
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:43,167
Um...

67
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:45,667
Yeah.

68
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:47,100
Uh...

69
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,667
I saw you in the bathroom.

70
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:50,800
You must be the new girl.

71
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,233
Um, I'm just, uh, temporary.

72
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,467
Figures.

73
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:55,567
That's why they sent me over.

74
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:57,900
They don't like our kind
mingling with the permanents.

75
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,267
Um, there's a phone call
for Mr. Wheeler.

76
00:08:01,467 --> 00:08:02,633
Eh, just leave 'em on hold.

77
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,067
They'll just get tired
and hang up.

78
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:05,167
That's lesson number one.

79
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,533
People that sit
in those little glass rooms

80
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,933
don't answer the phone
before 10.

81
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:10,133
Maybe I should take a message.

82
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:11,200
Hm.

83
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,533
[woman] Whoops. [laughs]

84
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,467
Oh, don't worry.

85
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,067
If it's important,
they'll call back.

86
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,467
[chuckles]

87
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,267
So, see they stuck you
at Louise's desk.

88
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:23,667
Might as well get comfortable.

89
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:25,767
She's gonna be out for a while,
if you know what I mean.

90
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:27,867
Claims she was in
a motorcycle accident.

91
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:29,567
She's probably faking it.

92
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:31,067
[phone ringing]

93
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
[sighs] I'll get it.

94
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:33,967
Oh, that pen doesn't work.

95
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:35,633
Oh, just go swipe one
off another desk.

96
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,633
Thanks.

97
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,100
[phone ringing]

98
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,833
Good morning. Global Credit.

99
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,633
I'm sorry, he's in a meeting.

100
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:51,500
[soft music]

101
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:07,733
Hank Starkwell.

102
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:09,800
Taxpayer.

103
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,700
Says he needs an answer
right away.

104
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,800
It's not 10 o'clock yet.

105
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,100
Hi.

106
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:19,900
Yeah, I talked to him.

107
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:21,867
He said go ahead and sell.

108
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:24,167
No, thank you.

109
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,167
All right,
you have a good day now. Bye.

110
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
That's another thing about
temping, give advice.

111
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:32,167
You know, by the time anyone
finds out, you'll be long gone.

112
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,067
Just be sure
to cover your tracks.

113
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:35,600
Mm.

114
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:37,933
Oh, the only real challenge
of this job

115
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,900
is trying to look busy
when there's nothing to do.

116
00:09:41,733 --> 00:09:43,400
They'll keep you here though,
it's how it works.

117
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:45,100
Part of the corporate hierarchy.

118
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:46,633
There's got to be a butt
in every seat

119
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,633
or the entire
infrastructure crumbles.

120
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,733
You drink coffee?

121
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:50,800
Sometimes.

122
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:51,933
Sooner or later,
someone will ask you

123
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:52,833
to fetch it for them.

124
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,133
I'll show you the kitchen.

125
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:55,867
This way, please.

126
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:00,167
I'm going to be
your tour guide today.

127
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,167
Welcome to
the wonderful world of credit.

128
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:04,467
Oh, how about this music?

129
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:06,867
Some Dodo bird
in Charleston did a study.

130
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:08,933
Said it increases
worker efficiency.

131
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,267
- [laughing]
- [Margaret] Scary, isn't it?

132
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:14,367
You know, sooner or later,
you learn to tune it out.

133
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
This is where Art sits.

134
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,567
Oh, that's nice.

135
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:20,267
The smaller the man, the bigger
the desk, I always say.

136
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:21,533
See that rubber band ball?

137
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,600
It's his prized possession.
Stay away from it.

138
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,300
Who's Art again?

139
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,433
He's the critter
that guards the supplies.

140
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,133
He does nothing really.

141
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,900
He counts paperclips,
checks the mileage

142
00:10:31,067 --> 00:10:32,133
on the copy machine.

143
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,767
Another tax deduction,
same as us.

144
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:34,833
Speak of the devil.

145
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,800
Why aren't you
at your desk, Art?

146
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:38,433
I needed pencil holders.

147
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,267
Oh really?

148
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:40,500
Well, we're working here.

149
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,333
Oh. I'm working, too.

150
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,367
Well act like it.

151
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,800
I am acting like it.

152
00:10:45,867 --> 00:10:47,333
Well let's see you
sit in that chair then, okay?

153
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,533
- Okay.
- The clock is ticking.

154
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,467
We're at work.

155
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:52,533
He'll look directly
at your feet.

156
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,933
He's got a thing about 'em.

157
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,533
[Art] I was in at 8:30.

158
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,400
Oh, God.

159
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,700
See that man?
That's Mr. Kilmer, the chairman.

160
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:02,300
I'm hoping he gives me
a recommendation

161
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:03,433
when I leave this place.

162
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,267
Good morning Mr. Kilmer. Hi.

163
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,067
I'm not gonna be a temp
much longer.

164
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:11,333
- [man] Oh, Miss?
- I've got seniority here.

165
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,733
- I've been here two years.
- We'll talk about it later.

166
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,067
- [man] Hello? Excuse me?
- They hire from within.

167
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,633
Person in the purple dress?

168
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:16,433
- Hello?
- Hi.

169
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:17,333
- What's your name?
- Margaret.

170
00:11:18,067 --> 00:11:18,400
Margaret. I'm Milton Lasky.

171
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:20,067
I know, I did that mass mailing
for you last month.

172
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:21,733
- You did that?
- It was 3,000 letters, yeah.

173
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,100
Really? You know,
we got a couple of them back.

174
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:25,467
I think it was
insufficient zip code.

175
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:26,767
But anyway, listen,

176
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:28,733
can you get me
the Copeland file immediately?

177
00:11:29,933 --> 00:11:31,267
And then I need some pencils
and I need a cup of coffee,

178
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:33,300
and you know, what I really need
is I need an assistant

179
00:11:33,467 --> 00:11:36,933
because I mean, you know,
an executive assistant is uh...

180
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,933
An assistant?

181
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:44,133
Here's the filing room.

182
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,533
Obviously.

183
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,133
Oh, my God, geez.

184
00:11:52,067 --> 00:11:53,500
This place is booby-trapped.

185
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,533
I swear.

186
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,500
This should be it. Look at this.

187
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:59,400
You know,
got files within files.

188
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:01,333
If you ever want to
make something disappear,

189
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,333
just misfile it.

190
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:03,667
Be gone forever.

191
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:05,133
Like magic.

192
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,433
[Margaret hums]

193
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:11,433
[door shuts]

194
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:13,367
[Margaret] Oh, hi.

195
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,733
Coffee's fresh. I just made it.

196
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,867
[Margaret]
Oh, we're just looking.

197
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,367
Remember to leave a donation.

198
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:18,833
Okay, mm-hm.

199
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:21,667
Come here, watch this.

200
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,567
Milt Lasky's cup.

201
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,700
[Margaret laughs]

202
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,433
One of these days, the entire
cup is going to disappear

203
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,100
just like that little bikini.

204
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:33,567
You never know.

205
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:37,067
Okay, let's deliver this,

206
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:38,300
I'll show you
the rest of the building

207
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,733
and then we'll get to
the other 50 percent of the job.

208
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,233
What's that?

209
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,167
Lunch.

210
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,167
See the girl in blue?
That's our spot.

211
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,667
Jane, Paula, this is Iris.

212
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:51,167
Don't panic. She's one of us.

213
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,067
Hi.

214
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:53,200
- Hi.
- Let me get you a chair.

215
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:54,467
Oh it's okay. I can just stand.

216
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:56,800
Oh, I'll just grab one
from the secretarial pool.

217
00:12:57,133 --> 00:12:58,467
Have you been temping
for very long?

218
00:12:59,467 --> 00:13:02,533
No, just one other job
at a bank.

219
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:03,800
Oh, a bank.

220
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:05,400
All right. Any cute guys?

221
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:08,067
I spent most of my time
in the basement.

222
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,433
God, they think they own
the furniture now, too.

223
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,167
Here you go.

224
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:12,833
You know,
they're just jealous, hm?

225
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,767
Right? You know?

226
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:16,833
[Jane] You know,
I-I-I got sent to a bank once

227
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:18,700
and it was a nightmare.

228
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:23,067
I set the alarm off and
the cops came. [laughs]

229
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:25,167
Ooh, I love the police, eh?
[laughs]

230
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:25,900
How'd you do it?

231
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:27,867
There was this button
on the desk

232
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:29,833
and I kept looking at it
every day for a month,

233
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:32,900
and finally I just, I pushed it.

234
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:34,267
Really?

235
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:35,100
Why?

236
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:37,433
Well, well how was
I supposed to know?

237
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,467
I mean, you know how it goes.

238
00:13:38,633 --> 00:13:40,200
They never really explain
anything to you

239
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:41,067
when you're a temp.

240
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:42,800
They figure you're not gonna
be around long enough

241
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:45,700
or you're trying to take away
their stupid job or something.

242
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,467
Well fat chance of that, huh?

243
00:13:47,633 --> 00:13:48,633
I've got bigger plans.

244
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:49,900
I'm a performer.

245
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:50,733
Oh?

246
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,500
Yeah, yeah. Drama's in my blood.

247
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,600
You know, but there's just,
here's no outlet for it here.

248
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:56,433
[Iris] Oh.

249
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:57,767
[whispering]
God, here he comes.

250
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,200
Eddie Pope,
works in the mailroom.

251
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,067
Another reject of capitalism.

252
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:03,700
Hi, ladies.

253
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:05,267
Who's your friend?

254
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:07,533
Her name's Iris.
She's not interested.

255
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,533
So Jane, you think
we can get together

256
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,967
for those drinks this week?

257
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:13,800
Oh, gosh.

258
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:16,933
You know Eddie, um, well,
Derek and I were going to go

259
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,200
and pick out our China patterns
for our wedding.

260
00:14:21,867 --> 00:14:22,500
Oh.

261
00:14:24,267 --> 00:14:25,333
[Eddie]
Maybe some other time then.

262
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,933
- [Jane] Bye.
- [Eddie] I gotta go.

263
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,900
I'm working on a job
for Mr. Kilmer.

264
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,233
- Ooh.
- Mmm.

265
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:31,867
[both chuckle]

266
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:33,133
Oh, God.

267
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:34,867
He has such a crush on Jane.

268
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:38,067
He can't even figure it out with
that big diamond ring and all.

269
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,700
Jane honey, shown 'em
that necklace Derek gave you.

270
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:42,433
Do you like it?

271
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,100
He felt bad for not picking me
up the other day,

272
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:46,567
so he gave this to me.

273
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:47,633
I can't wait for you guys
to meet him.

274
00:14:48,633 --> 00:14:49,267
He's going to come to
the happy hour tonight.

275
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:50,767
- Really?
- All right.

276
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:52,267
Great. You want to come?

277
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,433
We go every Wednesday.

278
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,933
It's great.
You know, you buy one drink,

279
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,567
you get all the free snacks
you can eat.

280
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:57,833
You should come. Wanna?

281
00:14:58,067 --> 00:14:58,667
Oh, um...

282
00:14:58,833 --> 00:14:59,767
Oh, you should come.

283
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:00,667
It's fun.

284
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,867
Be a good time.

285
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:04,267
I don't know.

286
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,767
Good.

287
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:08,167
[upbeat music]

288
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:26,867
[popping]

289
00:15:27,867 --> 00:15:30,467
[music continues]

290
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,833
[clock ticking]

291
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,400
[ticks loudly]

292
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,567
Hey, you guys, let's go
to the Thirty-Fiver this time.

293
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,200
I hear a lot of single men
go there.

294
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:54,300
Hey, as long as there's food.

295
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,300
No, I have to mail something
for Mr. Anderson first.

296
00:15:56,467 --> 00:15:57,733
Oh, of course you do.

297
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,800
What was--what'd you say?

298
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,733
I said of course she does.

299
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,900
Oh, sure.

300
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:02,700
Aww.

301
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:04,667
I've never been
in the Thirty-Fiver.

302
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,400
No, but I hear
it's really great.

303
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:08,200
Oh, oh, she's doing it again.

304
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,700
- Oh no.
- I--I'm gonna go get her.

305
00:16:09,867 --> 00:16:10,700
Oh, God.

306
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:13,433
Jane's got this
checking thing going.

307
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,067
She's a perfectionist.
It's a bit much.

308
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:19,367
- [upbeat music]
- [people chattering]

309
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:31,433
Oh, where's the waitress?

310
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,567
I need a drink.

311
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,467
She's flirting,
with the entire restaurant.

312
00:16:34,633 --> 00:16:36,800
On ladies night. Shame on her.

313
00:16:36,967 --> 00:16:38,067
[tsking]

314
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,800
Look at these,
aren't these cute?

315
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:41,333
I've got to remember to put
these shot glasses

316
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,333
on my bridal list.

317
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,467
Oh, give me your purse.

318
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,200
- What?
- [Margaret] Give me your purse.

319
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:46,533
Why?

320
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,533
[Margaret] Just give it to me.

321
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,233
There, saved you the trip.

322
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,367
Best wishes, Jane.

323
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:56,867
Somebody could have
seen that, Margaret.

324
00:16:57,067 --> 00:17:00,200
If anyone saw us,
we'd be drinking by now!

325
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:02,700
Taking another tip?

326
00:17:02,867 --> 00:17:04,133
[waitress laughs]

327
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,167
I don't like her.

328
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:07,067
Let's hit the buffet, come on.

329
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:09,067
Get me some nachos.
I'm gonna make a phone call.

330

- [people chattering]
- [soft music]

331
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:17,600
Watch out,
'cause those are spicy.

332
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:20,433
Ooh, you're right.

333
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,367
Burns.

334
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:23,100
Ow. Ooh.

335
00:17:24,467 --> 00:17:25,700
[Margaret laughs]

336
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,367
- Yeah.
- Oh, excuse me.

337
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,467
Now, I haven't ever
seen you here before.

338
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:34,233
Oh yeah?

339
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,333
You work around here?

340
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:38,067
Um, well I'll tell ya,
I'm freelance.

341
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,067
Oh?

342
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,800
What, uh, what line of work?

343
00:17:41,467 --> 00:17:44,200
Um, the credit business.
For now anyway.

344
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:45,267
Credit?

345
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,200
I did a book report once
for, uh, for extra credit.

346
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,233
Oh. [laughs]

347
00:17:51,067 --> 00:17:52,400
But that's not what you do,
I'm sure.

348
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:53,233
No it isn't, no.

349
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:55,467
Uh, let me give you
one of these.

350
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:56,267
Okay.

351
00:17:56,433 --> 00:17:58,233
[music continues]

352
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,800
[Jane] Ooh.

353
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:05,067
Boy.

354
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:07,600
Derek's gonna come by
and pick me up later.

355
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:08,667
He has to work late.

356
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:09,700
Hm.

357
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:11,067
Did you see that guy?

358
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:12,100
Did you see him?

359
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:15,200
He gave me his card, and a pen.

360
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:16,967
Jack Shoberg, CLU.

361
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:18,067
- Cute.
- [pen clicks]

362
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:18,733
[laughing]

363
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,300
What does CLU stand for?

364
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,700
[Paula]
Well, I tell you, I don't know,

365
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,767
but he's probably
an executive of some kind.

366
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:24,567
[Jane] How do I know that name?

367
00:18:25,633 --> 00:18:27,100
That sounds so familiar to me,
and I don't know.

368
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:29,867
Um, I think I need
to get more wings.

369
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:31,933
Oh, here I'm finished.
You can take mine.

370
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,900
Hm, well, I think
I want to stretch my legs.

371
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,700
Get it?

372
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:38,433
[laughing]

373
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:39,667
[Jane] Oh.

374
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:44,333
N-no, Jack Shoberg,
I know how I know his name.

375
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,500
The ladies room.

376
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:48,067
His card was on the floor
in my stall.

377
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,300
Ew, he's passing out his
business cards like it's candy.

378
00:18:51,467 --> 00:18:52,500
That's gross.

379
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,133
[men laughing]

380
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:57,500
Oh, God,
they're laughing at her.

381
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,067
Jerks.

382
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:00,200
Hey Jack!

383
00:19:08,467 --> 00:19:09,300
Okay, let's get out of here.

384
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,167
Time to go.

385
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,833
Come on, Paula,
we're out of here.

386
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:13,800
What?

387
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:14,967
Let's go.

388
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,967
But what about that guy
I just met?

389
00:19:17,467 --> 00:19:18,467
You can do better.

390
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:20,900
- All right.
- Hi, Camille.

391
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:21,900
Hi.

392
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:23,800
Hi. [laughs]

393
00:19:24,233 --> 00:19:25,733
I think he thinks
you're someone else.

394
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:26,800
Uh-huh.

395
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,667
Thank you.

396
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:33,500
Oh, I--I forgot just one thing.

397
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:37,633
- [soft music]
- [people chattering]

398
00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:49,167
[women grumbling]

399
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,333
[laughing]

400
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:52,667
[Paula] Oh, let's go in.

401
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,633
[Margaret] Eh, nah,
I don't believe that crap.

402
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:57,067
Oh, you know, some people
can really see into the future.

403
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:57,867
It's a fact.

404
00:19:58,067 --> 00:19:58,800
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

405
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:00,933
I read about a horse once
that had ESP.

406
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,867
He could type out messages
on a giant typewriter

407
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:06,733
with his, um, nose and
he predicted we would

408
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,333
enter World War II,
and he helped find the body

409
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,600
of a boy who'd been missing
for two years.

410
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:13,433
- Huh.
- He could type?

411
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:15,433
[laughs]

412
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:16,733
- Hey, how you doin'?
- [Margaret yells]

413
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,133
Whoa.

414
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,133
No, I'm just kidding.

415
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,100
- Hi.
- Hi.

416
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:22,467
Any of you want a reading?

417
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:25,200
I could give you a discount.

418
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:26,400
[Paula] All right.

419
00:20:27,433 --> 00:20:28,167
[Margaret] You said
the magic word. Discount.

420
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:30,067
Oh.

421
00:20:30,467 --> 00:20:31,900
I see changes ahead.

422
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,300
Something to do with work.

423
00:20:36,033 --> 00:20:37,500
My dad wants me
to get a real job.

424
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:38,500
Could that be it?

425
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:42,033
Depends. Is that what you want?

426
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,067
[sighs]

427
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:46,333
No.

428
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,400
I don't want to do sales.

429
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:51,533
Do you think maybe I'll just
be able to stay where I am?

430
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,167
Do you want to change
your destiny?

431
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,367
You tiptoe through life.

432
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,800
Don't be afraid
to make your mark.

433
00:21:16,867 --> 00:21:17,567
[Paula] <i>What'd she say to you?</i>

434
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:20,700
Some crap-oh-la she read off
some fortune cookie.

435
00:21:20,933 --> 00:21:22,900
The nail that stands out
gets pounded down.

436
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:24,900
- What a fraud.
- [car honks]

437
00:21:25,733 --> 00:21:26,567
Hey. [laughs]

438
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,733
Derek's here.

439
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:28,900
Do I smell like booze?

440
00:21:29,533 --> 00:21:31,100
Oh, you shouldn't care.

441
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:33,333
[Derek] Come on, hurry up.

442
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:34,933
See you tomorrow.

443
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,600
- Goodnight girls.

444
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:37,667
- Goodnight.
- Okay.

445
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:38,667
[Jane] Hi, Derek.

446
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:39,933
[Paula] Wow, do you see him?

447
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,333
Damn he's gorgeous.

448
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:43,133
What's his deal, though, anyway?

449
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,133
You know anything about him?

450
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,200
Well, I don't know
much about him

451
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:46,833
except they've been
going out forever

452
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:48,067
and he buys her a lot of gifts.

453
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,200
What more do you need to know?
[chuckles]

454
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:51,300
I'm tired. I'm going home.

455
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:52,233
How do you get home?

456
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,333
Oh, I take the Broad Street bus.

457
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,533
- So do I.
- I'll walk you guys.

458
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:57,833
Come on.

459
00:21:58,733 --> 00:21:59,667
- We should ride together.
- [Iris] Oh.

460
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:00,600
Right?

461
00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:02,067
- [Iris] Yeah!
- [Paula] All right.

462
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:03,633
[soft music]

463
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,800
[Iris whispering]
Don't tiptoe through life.

464
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,500
You have to make your mark.

465
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:16,167
[man] Hi there.

466
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,233
Hello.

467
00:22:18,267 --> 00:22:20,333
Hi. Would you mind
typing this letter from me?

468
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:21,833
Okay.

469
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:23,533
Thank you. I appreciate it.

470
00:22:29,367 --> 00:22:31,767
[music continues]

471
00:22:41,733 --> 00:22:42,567
Come in.

472
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,300
That was quick.

473
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,967
Could you make me
40 copies of this please?

474
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,967
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

475
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,567
By the way, what's your name?

476
00:22:58,133 --> 00:22:58,900
Iris.

477
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:00,700
Iris. Thank you, Iris.

478
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:05,967
[phone ringing]

479
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:10,100
[soft, quirky music]

00:23:16,633 --> 00:23:17,367
[Iris gasps]

481
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:20,200
I'm so--I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.

482
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,167
[music continues]

483
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,533
These are excellent.

484
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,933
Did you make 'em from scratch?

485
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,833
[Iris] Uh-huh.

486
00:23:33,067 --> 00:23:33,767
Where's yours?

487
00:23:34,367 --> 00:23:36,067
Oh, I ate it already.

488
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:38,067
[Margaret] Mm.

489
00:23:39,367 --> 00:23:40,267
- Mm.
- Yeah?

490
00:23:43,233 --> 00:23:44,233
[Iris] <i>I fit right in.</i>

491
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:45,300
<i>I liked it there.</i>

492
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:48,500
<i>We were becoming good friends.</i>

[laughing]

495
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:06,100
Ooh, oh, excuse me.

496
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:07,367
Sorry.

497
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,933
I am so bad. [chuckles]

498
00:24:16,233 --> 00:24:18,133
[people chattering]

499
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,500
Okay, watch this.

500
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:22,700

[laughing]

503
00:24:30,867 --> 00:24:32,200
- Happy?
- [Paula] Uh-huh.

504
00:24:32,567 --> 00:24:33,233
Okay.

505
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,167
[clears throat]

506
00:24:34,733 --> 00:24:36,933
[whimpering]

507
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:41,667
- Sad?
- Mm-hm.

508
00:24:45,733 --> 00:24:47,800
- Angry. [laughs]
- [Paula] Uh-huh, right.

509
00:24:48,467 --> 00:24:49,300
Okay.

510
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,167
[whimpering]

511
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:01,233
I give up.

512
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:02,567
It's fear.

513
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,833
Yeah.

514
00:25:05,233 --> 00:25:07,400
Got my stage name
all figured out, too.

515
00:25:07,567 --> 00:25:08,767
Camille LaPlante.

516
00:25:10,067 --> 00:25:10,700
[gasps]

517
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,567
Oh, you look beautiful.

518
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,467
[Paula] Thanks.

519
00:25:15,467 --> 00:25:16,600
[Iris] Oh, Camille LaPlante,
that's perfect.

520
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:17,700
[Paula] Uh-huh, yeah.

521
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,467
I'm gonna change it
legally, too,

522
00:25:19,633 --> 00:25:21,400
as soon as I can afford it,
you know?

523
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:22,933
Oh, I tell you,
ever since I was little,

524
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,300
I just, I knew I was meant
for something big, you know?

525
00:25:26,467 --> 00:25:29,067
That I was just, like,
meant to be somebody.

526
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,133
Just a matter of time
before I get discovered.

527
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:37,467
Oh look, here's one.

528
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:40,500
Low wages and all the office
supplies you can steal.

529
00:25:40,967 --> 00:25:42,533
[chuckles]
Oh, forget it.

530
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,500
You have to type.

531
00:25:43,867 --> 00:25:45,100
I thought you could type.

532
00:25:45,267 --> 00:25:46,667
No, I cheated on that test.

533
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,233
Oh, I just want a desk by
a window and a decent chair,

534
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,933
but this place is so cheap.

535
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,400
You know, they don't want
to pay benefits.

536
00:25:55,567 --> 00:25:56,933
That's why they hire transients.

537
00:25:57,233 --> 00:25:58,800
Yeah, and they keep on
hiring them, too.

538
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,067
[people chattering]

539
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,067
Hm, I should probably
introduce myself.

540
00:26:05,233 --> 00:26:07,133
I'm sure I'll be showing her
the ropes later.

541
00:26:08,933 --> 00:26:10,400
[Paula] Oh, her loss.

542
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,367
There she goes.

543
00:26:17,067 --> 00:26:19,367
I don't know,
it's good to care, you know?

544
00:26:19,533 --> 00:26:20,367
And to look like you care.

545
00:26:20,533 --> 00:26:21,100
Jane.

546
00:26:22,067 --> 00:26:22,933
Oh, Eddie?

547
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,067
Let me have Kilmer's mail.

548
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:25,267
- No I--
- Let me deliver this for you.

549
00:26:25,433 --> 00:26:26,767
I have to give it
to his assistant.

550
00:26:26,933 --> 00:26:27,500
His what?

551
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:29,067
The new girl, Cleo, over there.

552
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:31,800
Jane, I was at lunch and
I didn't see you down there.

553
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,600
[Jane] Oh, I'm on a diet.

554
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:35,267
[Eddie] You don't need a diet.

555
00:26:35,933 --> 00:26:38,133
Excuse me,
I thought she was just a temp,

556
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,067
'cause look at her.

557
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:40,367
Oh no, no.

558
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:41,800
She's Kilmer's new assistant.

559
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:43,067
And she's permanent.

560
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:44,400
How'd she get that job?

561
00:26:44,567 --> 00:26:45,700
I checked the bulletin board
every day.

562
00:26:45,867 --> 00:26:46,800
It wasn't posted.

563
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:49,067
Can I have those back?

564
00:26:51,233 --> 00:26:52,233
Yeah, here.

565
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:54,367
[whispering] Thank you.
It's the president's mail.

566
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,900
Would you look at that?

567
00:26:59,067 --> 00:26:59,900
A new desk.

568
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:05,333
[Margaret] Damn this place,
and everyone in it.

569
00:27:06,433 --> 00:27:08,833
- [soft music]
- [people chattering]

570
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:14,133
[soft, strange music]

571
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,667
[door closes]

572
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:37,067
[man] You look busy.

573
00:27:37,767 --> 00:27:39,733
[Iris] I didn't think you would
come back until Friday.

574
00:27:40,067 --> 00:27:41,167
Well. [kisses]

575
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:43,367
I thought I'd swing by
and see my girl.

576
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,600
You know, before I take a crack
at those stores in Greensburg.

577
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:49,067
So, what have you been up to?

578
00:27:49,867 --> 00:27:51,400
Well, my job's going
really well.

579
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:53,167
My boss really likes me.

580
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:54,500
There you go.

581
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:57,333
Haven't I always told you,
just hang in,

582
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,967
be your sweet self, and
good things are bound to happen.

583
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:02,400
[Iris] I made some
good friends there, too.

584
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,267
We went out to dinner
and everything.

585
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:06,167
Well they have good taste.

586
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:08,067
I hope you're gonna
stay in touch with them.

587
00:28:10,067 --> 00:28:10,800
What do you mean?

588
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,867
I mean after you move on

589
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:14,967
to the big job
with International Foods.

590
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:16,733
You know, I have a feeling
this is it.

591
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:17,800
This is the one.

592
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:20,133
[Iris] Yeah, I don't do so well
with interviews.

593
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,500
Don't be silly.

594
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:22,733
Of course you do.

595
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,667
You've just got to get in there
and promote yourself.

596
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,533
You know what they say, uh,

597
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,900
a good salesman is born,
not made.

598
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,367
You just happened to be born
Bud Chapman's daughter.

599
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:33,533
You're not a nobody.

600
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:36,733
Listen, you want me
to call Ed Clayburn

601
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,833
and see if I can't speed up
the whole process?

602
00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:40,067
Oh no, no, that's okay, um...

603
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:43,167
I actually spoke to him today
and he said he had

604
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:45,067
to go out of town for a while,
but he got my letter

605
00:28:45,233 --> 00:28:46,133
and he's going to give me a call

606
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,700
when he gets back and
set up an interview.

607
00:28:48,867 --> 00:28:50,600
[Bud] Great. You're off
to a good start.

608
00:28:50,967 --> 00:28:53,100
You know with your education
and personality,

609
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:55,400
why, you could take over
a company.

610
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,200
[Iris laughs]

611
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,700
[Bud] You just have to get
in the door!

612
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,067
[soft music]

613
00:29:10,467 --> 00:29:11,633
[Iris] <i>Most people</i>
spend their lives</i>

614
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,167

<i>Every day, events</i>

616
00:29:17,267 --> 00:29:19,600

617

<i>Little things.</i>

618

<i>Quiet things.</i>

619
00:29:24,367 --> 00:29:25,833
<i>You hardly even notice.</i>

620
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,167
[in French accent]
That is a French tip.

621
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,767
French tip.

625
00:30:25,267 --> 00:30:26,800
<i>That's how it went</i>

626
00:30:27,233 --> 00:30:28,933
<i>We were all just killing time,</i>

627
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,667
<i>waiting for something</i>
to happen, anything.</i>

628
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:36,133
<i>And then one day,</i>
something did.</i>

629
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:43,467
- [rumbling]
- [phones ringing]

630
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:53,900
[panting]

631
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,600
Thief, thief!

632
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,867
The money from the coffee can.

633
00:31:03,067 --> 00:31:04,167
It's missing.

634
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:05,500
- [Paula laughing]
- Crime in the office,

635
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:06,833
crime in the workplace.

636
00:31:07,067 --> 00:31:08,333
- [Paula] Can you believe it?
- This is stupid.

637
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,333
[Paula] Three lousy dollars,
the whole place falls to pieces.

638
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,967
I hope they don't
take it out of our pay.

639
00:31:12,133 --> 00:31:13,467
- Oh, I hope not.
- Oh, three dollars.

640
00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:14,867
No, come on now,
they wouldn't do that.

641
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,367
I don't think so.

642
00:31:16,533 --> 00:31:18,100
[Margaret] They've done
stupider things, my dear.

643
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:18,933
[Paula] Hey, now.

644
00:31:19,733 --> 00:31:20,867
[Paula]
God, they were screaming.

<i>We didn't know what it meant</i>
at the time.</i>

649
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:37,433
<i>Didn't change our routine.</i>

something in the air,</i>

there was anything</i>

It was here before, wasn't it?

658
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:24,600
I checked out at lunch,
didn't I?

659
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:25,433
I don't know, honey.

I don't know,

661
00:32:28,067 --> 00:32:29,233
- Copy guy is here.
- You know what, here.

662
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:31,367
Just take a new one,
a blank one.

663

a confession to make, Art.

pencils on the corner.

Just to try to make ends meet,
you know?

Is that okay with you?

00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:22,067
Well...

682
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,700
You'll keep it a secret?

Okay.

I don't know.

691
00:33:52,633 --> 00:33:54,600
Um, so how do you get
to be a repairman anyway?

692
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:57,967
I mean, do you go
to a special school, or what?

693
00:34:00,933 --> 00:34:02,667
Um, the machine
is being repaired right now.

694

come back.

hide and seek?

my coffee mug?

Oh, that really nice one
with the naked lady on it?

- No I haven't.

I'm sure, yeah.

in it and it was on my desk.

- Staff meeting.

00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,600
We're not on the staff.

716
00:34:51,767 --> 00:34:52,700
It's for everyone.

717
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,667
All the department heads
are going to be there.

718
00:34:58,133 --> 00:35:00,833
[whispering] Um, I have to ask
you to sit in that chair

719
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:02,933
because you're sitting
in my seat, thank you.

720
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:05,067
I always sit in this seat.

721
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,167
It's--it's respect.
It is my seat.

722
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,333
Thank you.

723
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,967
[sniffing]

724
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:22,067
[whispering] Excuse me.

725
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,600
[Kilmer] I've called
this meeting today because

726
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:28,200
a serious problem has been
brought to my attention.

727
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:31,367
This morning,
Tom Briggs in accounting

728
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:35,900
noticed his crystal paperweight
was missing.

729
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,400
A number of you
have also reported--

730
00:35:39,567 --> 00:35:42,967
My--my, uh coffee mug
was also missing.

731
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:44,367
I mean, actually it was stolen.

732
00:35:44,533 --> 00:35:46,100
It wasn't really missing.
It was stolen.

733
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:48,567
From my office.

734
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,433
Recently.

735
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:54,367
[laughs]

736
00:35:54,533 --> 00:35:56,200
[Kilmer] A number of you
have also reported

737
00:35:56,367 --> 00:35:57,867
- personal items missing.
- Sh.

738
00:35:58,067 --> 00:36:00,333
Mr. Dalton's
gold cigarette lighter,

739
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:03,067
a framed photograph
and dictionary

740
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,733
from Fred's desk, I believe.

741
00:36:06,067 --> 00:36:08,233
And some spoons
from the kitchen.

742
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,067
[Kilmer] Yes, Diane?

743
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,600
I keep a pair of shoes
in my desk

744
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:15,500
and now one of them is missing.

745
00:36:17,267 --> 00:36:18,233
What?

746
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,700
I didn't take it.

747
00:36:21,967 --> 00:36:26,467
If anyone here has a problem,
financial or otherwise,

748
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,967
come forward and say something.

749
00:36:34,267 --> 00:36:36,600
I like to think of us
as a family here.

750
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,633
It's difficult for me to believe
that someone in this room

751
00:36:44,233 --> 00:36:46,333
could be capable of stealing.

752
00:36:48,067 --> 00:36:48,833
Mm.

753
00:36:53,933 --> 00:36:57,567
- [soft music]
- [people chattering]

754
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:14,467
[Paula] <i>Who do you think</i>
is doing it?</i>

755
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,433
Use your heads.
It's that new girl.

756
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:18,267
- You mean Cleo?
- Yeah, I do.

757
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,333
All that missing junk?

758
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:20,900
None of it was missing
until she showed up.

759
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:23,067
[Jane] Oh, Margaret, how could
you be so sure it's her?

760
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,400
Oh, come on.
She's Kilmer's assistant.

761
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:28,367
She's got free access
to anyone's office she pleases.

762
00:37:28,533 --> 00:37:29,433
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, but why?

763
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,433
Why would she steal?

764
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,267
Why? Why not?

765
00:37:31,433 --> 00:37:32,567
What difference does it make?

766
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,433
Look, all I know is
that everything was fine

767
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,767
- until she showed up. [scoffs]
- Mm-hm.

768
00:37:37,267 --> 00:37:38,667
- [both] Hm.
- This is not right for me.

769
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:40,167
You know who
would look great with this?

770
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:41,167
Iris.

771
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,067
Oh, no,
I don't wear much lipstick.

772
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:43,867
Why not?

773
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:45,533
You got such a beautiful mouth.

774
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,167
You got lips that say
hi, I'm here.

775
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,167
I wanna be heard.

776
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,233
Look at that.

777
00:37:51,567 --> 00:37:52,867
Excuse me. [chuckles]

778
00:37:54,567 --> 00:37:55,167
Hi.

779
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:57,933
Yeah, um, do you have
any free samples of this?

780
00:37:58,267 --> 00:37:59,900
No, we certainly don't.

781
00:38:00,133 --> 00:38:02,467
Uh, that's 50 dollars an ounce.

782
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:04,600
Okay, great.
I have very expensive taste.

783
00:38:04,767 --> 00:38:05,800
Yes, you do.

784
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,167
Oh, I gotta get my hands
on some of that.

785
00:38:12,633 --> 00:38:14,300
Oh, that's pretty.
You should get that.

786
00:38:14,467 --> 00:38:15,400
Oh no, I don't need anything.

787
00:38:15,567 --> 00:38:17,367
- It'd look really good on you.
- Hm.

788
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:19,467
Yeah.
Maybe it's part of the sale.

789
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:22,300
You know, why don't you ask
that lady over there?

790
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:24,600
[Iris] Oh no,
I don't wanna bother her.

791
00:38:25,433 --> 00:38:27,100
[Margaret] Excuse me,
is this part of the sale?

792
00:38:27,733 --> 00:38:29,067
Excuse me, miss?

793
00:38:30,067 --> 00:38:31,400
Excuse me.

794
00:38:32,533 --> 00:38:35,400
If it's not on sale,
it should be,

795
00:38:35,867 --> 00:38:37,233
I could tell you that much.

796
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,300
No, it's okay,
I'll pay whatever.

797
00:38:40,467 --> 00:38:42,233
Just go like this
if she looks our way, okay?

798
00:38:43,067 --> 00:38:45,100
We're going for the discount.
[laughs]

799
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:48,267
[soft music]

800
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:51,433
[Iris]</i>
That night I thought about</i>

801
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,633
<i>the missing items at work.</i>

802
00:38:53,067 --> 00:38:54,833
<i>How every object</i>
has its own story,</i>

803
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,633
<i>like a seashell, or a notebook.</i>

804
00:39:00,433 --> 00:39:03,233
<i>What seems ordinary to one</i>
person is another's treasure.</i>

805
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,133
- [Jane] <i>Hi, Iris.</i>
- [Paula] Well I love

806
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,567
- that ensemble.
- [laughs]

807
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:08,333
- Look.
- Wow.

808
00:39:08,733 --> 00:39:09,500
Matching umbrella.

809
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,267
- [Margaret] Morning.
- Good morning.

810
00:39:12,467 --> 00:39:13,700
[Margaret] Ooh, mamacita.

811
00:39:13,867 --> 00:39:14,933
What's the big occasion?

812
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,067
[chuckles] The copy guy.

813
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,633
Today's the day I make my move.

814
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,133
Oh, well you smell nice.

815
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:20,100
Thank you.

816
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,533
- [Margaret] Hey Barbara.
- [Iris] Oh, morning Barbara.

817
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,133
- Good morning.
- [Paula] Good morning.

818
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,833
Um, I understand that
the four of you

819
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:30,433
left early yesterday.

820
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,400
I hope you remembered
to adjust your time cards.

821
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,333
- We will.
- Oh yeah, we will.

822
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,300
Also, it has come to
my attention that some of you

823
00:39:38,467 --> 00:39:40,133
are making personal phone calls.

824
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,967
That is against company policy.

825
00:39:43,267 --> 00:39:45,567
[Paula] Wow. You know what?
I love your scarf.

826
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,067
Ooh, these colors really
compliment your skin tone,

827
00:39:48,233 --> 00:39:48,900
you know that?

828
00:39:49,067 --> 00:39:50,167
Oh Barbara, listen.

829
00:39:50,633 --> 00:39:52,767
The um, the copy machine's
not working again.

830
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,967
Now, do you want me
to call the repair guy?

831
00:39:55,133 --> 00:39:55,700
'Cause I will.

832
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,367
Oh no, no.
That won't be necessary.

833
00:39:57,533 --> 00:39:58,633
I'll have Cleo
take a look at it.

834
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,200
She's very good with
office equipment. [chuckles]

835
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,067
Okay, great. Okay.

836
00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:05,700
Shit, shit.

837
00:40:06,033 --> 00:40:07,967
Shit, I just got
this new outfit and everything.

838
00:40:08,133 --> 00:40:10,567
I just ...can't believe
that skinny bitch

839
00:40:10,733 --> 00:40:12,500
knows how to fix a copy machine.

840
00:40:12,667 --> 00:40:13,867
She was hanging around
my desk the other day

841
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:15,033
when I was on the phone.

842
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:18,033
I wonder if she was the one
who ratted on me

843
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,233
for making personal phone calls.

844
00:40:20,367 --> 00:40:20,733
I wonder if she saw us
leave early yesterday, you know?

845
00:40:21,867 --> 00:40:23,433
I'm not afraid of her, I mean,
'cause she's got a job.

846
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,433
She's a nothing.

847
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,300
She's wearing your sweater.

848
00:40:38,133 --> 00:40:38,967
Yeah.

849
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,367
That's weird.

850
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:45,700
- [soft music]
- [people chattering]

851
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,133
I like your blouse.

852
00:41:25,967 --> 00:41:27,067
[phone ringing]

853
00:41:28,533 --> 00:41:29,100
Hi--

854
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,067
Yeah.

855
00:41:35,133 --> 00:41:37,300
[ripping]

856
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,767
[music continues]

857
00:41:46,533 --> 00:41:48,800
[Iris] <i>That new girl,</i>
she kept to herself.</i>

858
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:50,900
<i>That made her suspicious,</i>
I guess.</i>

859
00:41:51,667 --> 00:41:53,300
<i>But somehow</i>
just by being there,</i>

860
00:41:53,467 --> 00:41:55,200
<i>she seemed to bring us</i>
closer together.</i>

861
00:41:56,133 --> 00:41:56,833
[Paula] Mm!

862
00:41:57,667 --> 00:41:59,067
Hey, guess who I saw last night?

863
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,500
Jack Shoberg.

864
00:42:00,967 --> 00:42:02,100
- CLU?
- Uh-huh.

865
00:42:02,767 --> 00:42:03,467
[Iris gasps]

866
00:42:03,733 --> 00:42:05,567
Wow, shoot, it's so huge.

867
00:42:05,733 --> 00:42:07,233
I know. [laughs]

868
00:42:07,533 --> 00:42:08,333
[Milt] My presentation is gone.

869
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:10,433
In fact, somebody has
stolen my presentation,

870
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,667
and I don't have a copy of it.

871
00:42:12,067 --> 00:42:13,667
My--my presentation's
in 30 minutes.

872
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:14,500
- Oh that's terrible.
- So, could we do

873
00:42:14,667 --> 00:42:15,600
something about this please?

874
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:16,867
My presentation is gone.

875
00:42:17,133 --> 00:42:19,333
[stammers] In 30 minutes,
the client is coming in.

876
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,133
I can't find it and
I don't have a backup file,

877
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,333
and I think, in fact, somebody
has stolen my presentation.

878
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,100
[Margaret] Okay. We're on it.

879
00:42:25,267 --> 00:42:26,500
Hey, did you guys see Jane?

880
00:42:26,667 --> 00:42:27,333
[Milt] I need help.

881
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,833
Could you, like be busy
and you know, help?

882
00:42:30,067 --> 00:42:31,067
I'd like help, okay?

883
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,200
My presentation is gone.

884
00:42:33,433 --> 00:42:34,900
They won't remember it,
so when you get to the numbers,

885
00:42:35,067 --> 00:42:35,933
you just follow the numbers.

886
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,400
Don't care about
the colors, okay?

887
00:42:37,567 --> 00:42:39,067
They happen to be
different colors 'cause I did it

888
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,467
- on different days.
- He wants to talk to Bob.

889
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,833
Well, I don't care who he is.

890
00:42:42,067 --> 00:42:44,067
You keep talking to Mort
and you find an answer

891
00:42:44,233 --> 00:42:45,300
because he has
some of the papers.

892
00:42:45,467 --> 00:42:46,633
[Margaret]
Ugh, I just bought this blouse.

893
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,967
I was going to wear it
for an audition.

894
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:49,433
I told you to wear a bib.

895
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:51,967
Oh God, let me go help her.

896
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:56,433
Mr. Lasky,
we've got it all taken care of.

897
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,800
You can take this call
into your office.

898
00:42:58,967 --> 00:43:00,533
Honey, I'll call back.
Bye-bye, sweetie.

899
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,800
- Did we do spell check?
- Of course.

900
00:43:02,967 --> 00:43:03,567
- You're sure?
- Mm-hm.

901
00:43:04,433 --> 00:43:05,067
- [Milt] You wanna check?
- Uh-huh.

902
00:43:07,067 --> 00:43:08,500
Thank God one of us
can type, huh?

903
00:43:08,667 --> 00:43:09,400
[Margaret] Got it.

904
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,433
[grunts]

905
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,933
Oh, Jesus.

906
00:43:16,433 --> 00:43:17,833
Oh, check out the new look.

907
00:43:18,067 --> 00:43:18,867
Wire rims.

908
00:43:20,533 --> 00:43:22,833
Why--why is she looking at us
and writing stuff down?

909
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:25,233
- I don't understand--
- Because she's spying on us.

910
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:31,533
Noticed that Cleo
didn't get her hands dirty, huh.

911
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,567
Who do you think took
those damn documents, anyway?

912
00:43:33,733 --> 00:43:35,067
She was watching us
the whole time.

913
00:43:35,167 --> 00:43:36,567
[Jane]
I'm getting a little sick of it.

914
00:43:37,867 --> 00:43:38,600
I don't know about you girls,

915
00:43:38,767 --> 00:43:39,733
but we're doing
all the shit work

916
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:40,800
and they still don't even
notice us.

917
00:43:40,967 --> 00:43:41,767
I don't think it's very funny.

918
00:43:41,933 --> 00:43:43,067
Hey, I'm not laughing.

919
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,300
Yeah, you know what, Jane?

920
00:43:44,467 --> 00:43:45,467
Honey, get me a tissue,
will you?

921
00:43:46,633 --> 00:43:47,633
In fact, give me a whole roll
because I'm low at home.

922
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,400
You know what?
This calls for action.

923
00:43:50,133 --> 00:43:51,633
I think we should go on strike.

924
00:43:52,467 --> 00:43:53,767
Just not show up one day.

925
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:55,900
[laughs] Could you imagine?

926
00:43:56,067 --> 00:43:57,367
They'd be--
they'd be totally lost.

927
00:43:57,533 --> 00:43:59,067
They'd be completely scrambled.

928
00:43:59,167 --> 00:44:00,667
Especially between nine and 10.

929
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:01,833
My God, the phones.

930
00:44:02,767 --> 00:44:03,667
You know, with all of us out,

931
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:05,067
they'd definitely see
how much they need us.

932
00:44:05,633 --> 00:44:06,233
I think we should do it.

933
00:44:06,967 --> 00:44:07,567
[Paula laughs] Oh, count me in.

934
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,067
I'm looking forward to it, huh?

935
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,400
Yeah, so am I.

936
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:12,633
Ooh, me too. Oh, my God.

937
00:44:14,133 --> 00:44:15,567
[thunder rumbling]

938
00:44:15,733 --> 00:44:17,433
Wow, it's really coming down.

939
00:44:17,733 --> 00:44:18,833
Even the old ladies are running.

940
00:44:19,067 --> 00:44:19,733
Geez.

941
00:44:20,933 --> 00:44:21,867
You coming or what?

942
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,200
Criminals secretly
wanna get caught.

943
00:44:27,533 --> 00:44:30,400
I read that once,
they have a guilty conscience.

944
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:31,733
Right, yeah.

945
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:33,833
She'll trip up.
Nothing lasts forever.

946
00:44:35,233 --> 00:44:37,167
Iris, isn't that
Jane's boyfriend?

947
00:44:40,933 --> 00:44:42,567
That chick better be his cousin.

948
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:45,600
Oh, man.

949
00:44:46,067 --> 00:44:47,400
Son of a bitch.

950
00:44:47,967 --> 00:44:49,400
Two weeks before her shower.

951
00:44:50,067 --> 00:44:51,067
He's going to have to
buy her something

952
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,367
really big for this one.
[laughs]

953
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,167
Sorry about the mess.

954
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:56,567
My roommate's out of town.

955
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,167
Just make yourself comfortable.

956
00:45:00,733 --> 00:45:02,067
Take your coat off.

957
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:05,900
Oh.

958
00:45:07,567 --> 00:45:09,200
- [laughs]
- So what's your roommate like?

959
00:45:09,567 --> 00:45:10,900
You know what? I don't know.

960
00:45:11,067 --> 00:45:12,200
[laughs]

961
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,267
Well, we never see each other.

962
00:45:14,933 --> 00:45:16,633
- She's a flight attendant.
- [sighs]

963
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,700
We communicate
through notes on the fridge.

964
00:45:18,933 --> 00:45:20,267
Oh, just like the ones at work.

965
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,067
Yeah.
Yeah, can I fix you a drink?

966
00:45:23,733 --> 00:45:25,300
- Yeah, sure.
- Why don't you go sit down,

967
00:45:25,467 --> 00:45:26,800
and I'll be your hostess.

968
00:45:28,367 --> 00:45:30,267
I got that from a hotel
I was staying at.

969
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,700
A little souvenir, you know?

970
00:45:31,867 --> 00:45:32,633
- Yeah.
- It's cute, right?

971
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,367
Yeah.

972
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,133
Oh.

973
00:45:38,367 --> 00:45:39,900
You know, I like your apartment.

974
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,467
- Really?
- Yeah.

975
00:45:42,133 --> 00:45:42,833
Mm.

976
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:46,500
You know, this is the closest
I've come to living by myself.

977
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,833
I was--growing up,
I had to share everything

978
00:45:49,067 --> 00:45:49,933
with my sisters.

979
00:45:51,067 --> 00:45:52,767
Perfect sisters, hm.

980
00:45:53,267 --> 00:45:55,267
You know, who would have thought
getting a crummy job

981
00:45:55,433 --> 00:45:56,600
would be so hard?

982
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,067
[coughs]

983
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:58,967
You know,
the last place I was at,

984
00:45:59,633 --> 00:46:00,667
I was there for three years.

985
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:02,067
The place was so big,
there were temps

986
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:03,067
filling in in for temps.

987
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,067
I don't think anyone even knew
I was there, really.

988
00:46:07,567 --> 00:46:08,333
Why'd you leave?

989
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:10,067
Oh, I didn't leave.
I got canned.

990
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:11,233
[laughs]

991
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,900
Yeah, I was fired. Ya know.

992
00:46:14,267 --> 00:46:16,167
Guy hired some relative over me.

993
00:46:16,533 --> 00:46:17,167
Permanent.

994
00:46:21,067 --> 00:46:22,267
And I can sit there
and do nothing

995
00:46:22,433 --> 00:46:24,633
as good as anyone's nephew,
you know?

996
00:46:24,967 --> 00:46:26,667
Three years, zip, nothing.

997
00:46:26,833 --> 00:46:28,133
Not even a recommendation.

998
00:46:30,767 --> 00:46:33,333
I think Mr. Lasky is really
starting to depend on you.

999
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,767
I think you, you know,
if you asked,

1000
00:46:35,933 --> 00:46:37,300
he'd give you a recommendation.

1001
00:46:37,467 --> 00:46:38,533
I hope you're right.

1002
00:46:40,267 --> 00:46:41,633
I need that recommendation.

1003
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:46,300
To the recommendation.
[chuckles]

1004
00:46:48,067 --> 00:46:48,633
Mm.

1005
00:46:49,433 --> 00:46:51,067
To the recommendation.
[chuckles]

1006
00:46:52,233 --> 00:46:52,900
Hmm.

1007
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,167
[Iris coughs]

1008
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,367
I can't believe you got one
of these, wasn't it expensive?

1009
00:47:02,533 --> 00:47:04,533
Oh yeah, please don't
make fun of me today.

1010
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:05,800
My parents are in town.

1011
00:47:06,067 --> 00:47:06,833
- Good morning.
- Hi.

1012
00:47:07,067 --> 00:47:07,967
How are you today?

1013
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,067
[laughs] You look great.

1014
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,133
[Margaret] No, no, no, no, no.

1015
00:47:11,533 --> 00:47:12,867
My mom and dad are in town.

1016
00:47:13,067 --> 00:47:14,633
Oh, look at you.

1017
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,800
[Iris] Hey,
how was the audition?

1018
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,733
Oh, it went okay.

1019
00:47:18,067 --> 00:47:18,767
I got a small part.

1020
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,500
- [Iris gasps] Oh.
- I can't wait to see

1021
00:47:20,667 --> 00:47:21,700
you act professionally.

1022
00:47:21,867 --> 00:47:23,233
It's too bad that last show
fell through.

1023
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,067
- [Paula] Yeah.
- When's this one coming up?

1024
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,433
Um, I'm not sure yet,

1025
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,367
but when I know,
I'll let you know, okay?

1026
00:47:28,533 --> 00:47:29,767
You know what? I gotta get in.

1027
00:47:29,933 --> 00:47:31,533
- All right.
- [Paula] So, all right.

1028
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:34,933
- [Iris] Hi.
- [Margaret] Lasky needs these

1029
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,833
by five. He's been checking on
me every 30 freaking seconds.

1030
00:47:38,067 --> 00:47:38,600
I'm gonna lose my--

1031
00:47:39,567 --> 00:47:40,467
[gasps] Look, it's finished,
it's all done.

1032
00:47:41,667 --> 00:47:42,533
I really can't deal with this
now, I'm incredibly late,

1033
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,267
so if my wife calls,
would you tell her that

1034
00:47:44,433 --> 00:47:45,667
I left 15 minutes ago,

1035
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:46,933
but there's just
a lot of traffic?

1036
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:50,167
And Ellen? Ellen,
your hair is so beautiful.

1037
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:52,133
I mean, it looks great
with that little thing in it.

1038
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,067
Do you think you could find out

1039
00:47:53,233 --> 00:47:54,467
what kind of perfume she wears?

1040
00:47:54,633 --> 00:47:55,467
- Mm-hm?
- [Milt] Would that be possible?

1041
00:47:55,633 --> 00:47:56,700
- Yeah.
- [Milt] And also

1042
00:47:56,867 --> 00:47:57,733
if it's her birthday coming up?

1043
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:58,833
[box clattering]

1044
00:47:59,733 --> 00:48:03,233
- [soft music]
- [phones ringing]

1045
00:48:03,633 --> 00:48:05,833
No machine can replace me
until it learns how to drink.

1046
00:48:06,067 --> 00:48:06,667
Want some?

1047
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:07,967
[Iris] No, I shouldn't.

1048
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,200
Mm.

1049
00:48:11,967 --> 00:48:13,333
Gettin' a head start on tonight.

1050
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,333
My mom and dad
are taking me out to dinner

1051
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:18,400
to hear
the big loser speech while

1052
00:48:18,567 --> 00:48:20,533
- I eat my free chow mein.
- [spraying]

1053
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,500
You're not a loser.

1054
00:48:24,267 --> 00:48:26,200
[whispering] Really? [sighs]

1055
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,233
I can just hear my dad now,
yeah.

1056
00:48:28,667 --> 00:48:30,667
Why can't you be
more like your sisters?

1057
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,633
Is it that hard
to find permanence?

1058
00:48:37,767 --> 00:48:39,667
Yeah. Yeah it is.

1059
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,633
You could tell him how hard
you've been working here.

1060
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,067
I mean, that's something.

1061
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,800
Yeah, you're right.

1062
00:48:49,967 --> 00:48:51,467
You know what,
that's a good idea.

1063
00:48:51,633 --> 00:48:52,467
I think they'll understand.

1064
00:48:52,867 --> 00:48:53,933
I'm gonna go smoke.

1065
00:49:13,633 --> 00:49:16,600
So will you be taking
this bus to your rehearsals too?

1066
00:49:16,767 --> 00:49:17,633
I--I guess so.

1067
00:49:19,133 --> 00:49:21,100
You know, when they start,
I mean, right?

1068
00:49:23,867 --> 00:49:25,733
I'll tell you, that Jack guy
better call me soon.

1069
00:49:26,367 --> 00:49:27,567
I left him two messages.

1070
00:49:27,967 --> 00:49:29,200
I suppose he thinks I'm just,
you know,

1071
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:30,433
going to sit around and wait.

1072
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,767
Well, I tell you,
I got better things

1073
00:49:31,933 --> 00:49:33,200
to do with my time, right?

1074
00:49:33,533 --> 00:49:34,533
- Yeah?
- [Iris chuckles]

1075
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,833
Don't worry. He'll call.

1076
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:37,600
I'm not worried.

1077
00:49:40,533 --> 00:49:41,733
- [car horn beeps]
- [Bud] Iris?

1078
00:49:41,967 --> 00:49:43,267
[Iris] Oh, my dad's here.

1079
00:49:43,533 --> 00:49:44,433
Hey, you want to come meet him?

1080
00:49:44,867 --> 00:49:45,767
He could give you a ride.

1081
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,667
Well, I'll tell you,
the bus will be here soon.

1082
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:48,433
I'll wait.

1083
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,233
You sure?

1084
00:49:49,633 --> 00:49:50,933
Yeah, I'm fine. Go ahead.

1085
00:49:51,333 --> 00:49:52,600
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

1086
00:49:57,633 --> 00:49:58,500
- Hi.
- Hi.

1087
00:49:58,867 --> 00:49:59,833
Wow. Small world, huh?

1088
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,533
- Yeah.
- [laughing]

1089
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,667
I had to pick up something
from the mall,

1090
00:50:04,833 --> 00:50:06,633
so I thought I'd swing by here
and, you know,

1091
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,633
- see if I could catch ya.
- Yeah, thanks.

1092
00:50:09,667 --> 00:50:10,567
Look in the backseat.

1093
00:50:11,667 --> 00:50:12,333
[Iris gasps]

1094
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,533
[Bud] I had it on layaway.

1095
00:50:14,733 --> 00:50:16,900
Dad, it looks expensive.

1096
00:50:17,233 --> 00:50:17,833
I don't really need it.

1097
00:50:18,733 --> 00:50:19,367
They don't care
what I wear at this job.

1098
00:50:19,733 --> 00:50:20,867
Oh, don't be silly.

1099
00:50:21,233 --> 00:50:22,033
You're going to need it,
all right,

1100
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,200
for that big interview.

1101
00:50:23,867 --> 00:50:26,033
It's what's known as
a power suit.

1102
00:50:26,767 --> 00:50:28,567
I'm sure you'll hear something
really soon.

1103
00:50:29,133 --> 00:50:30,467
Yeah, I guess.

1104
00:50:31,667 --> 00:50:34,167
[Bud] I mean, they've had
your letter for a while now.

1105
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,700
[soft music]

1106
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,500
Morning, Iris.

1107
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,633
- Hi.
- Oh, my God,

1108
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,900
it's so bright in here.

1109
00:51:17,067 --> 00:51:19,167
I feel like I'm inside
a Xerox machine.

1110
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:20,067
[chuckles]

1111
00:51:21,067 --> 00:51:22,267
[Margaret] I got so wasted
last night I told my dad

1112
00:51:22,433 --> 00:51:23,933
I got a real job here.

1113
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,200
[scoffs] Executive assistant.

1114
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,733
[laughing]

1115
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,767
[woman] Please.

1116
00:51:29,133 --> 00:51:30,467
Like she needs a briefcase.

1117
00:51:31,733 --> 00:51:33,800
You know, in one ear
and out the other, lady.

1118
00:51:36,767 --> 00:51:37,433
How much you wanna bet

1119
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,267
it's about another
sudden disappearance?

1120
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:42,833
[employees chattering]

1121
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:44,767
What's going on?

1122
00:51:45,633 --> 00:51:47,267
[employees chattering]

1123
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,167
Lasky's dead.

1124
00:51:50,667 --> 00:51:52,400
He had a heart attack
last night.

1125
00:52:03,267 --> 00:52:06,067
[people chattering in distance]

1126
00:52:09,767 --> 00:52:11,333
You're lucky
you latched onto MacNamee.

1127
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,767
He really appreciates you.

1128
00:52:13,367 --> 00:52:14,800
Not to mention he's alive.

1129
00:52:16,067 --> 00:52:18,067
Try getting a recommendation
out of a dead guy.

1130
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:24,567
Can I have one of those?

1131
00:52:25,067 --> 00:52:25,700
Hm.

1132
00:52:33,133 --> 00:52:34,400
You see that old lady
over there?

1133
00:52:34,567 --> 00:52:35,733
That's me in a couple of years.

1134
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:37,467
[sighs]

1135
00:52:37,633 --> 00:52:38,433
What are you lookin' at?

1136
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,800
What are you lookin' at?
Get out of here.

1137
00:52:44,133 --> 00:52:48,567
Do you ever feel like you're...
like you're floating?

1138
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,667
Like you're...you're not
connected to anything

1139
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:54,667
or anybody?

1140
00:52:57,333 --> 00:52:59,400
Yeah. [clears throat] Sometimes.

1141
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,800
I feel like I can vanish and
no one would even notice,

1142
00:53:05,967 --> 00:53:06,833
not for weeks.

1143
00:53:09,467 --> 00:53:12,500
- [cars passing]
- [people chattering]

1144
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,633
- [upbeat music]
- [people chattering]

1145
00:53:27,233 --> 00:53:27,900
[Iris] Where's Jane?

1146
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:29,333
[Margaret]
Oh, she's still getting ready.

1147
00:53:30,433 --> 00:53:32,067
[woman] Hope you're all ready
to play some games.

1148
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:34,200
Hey you know,
Jane's sister's an actress too,

1149
00:53:34,367 --> 00:53:35,200
just like you.

1150
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,200
What?

1151
00:53:36,367 --> 00:53:37,333
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

1152
00:53:38,233 --> 00:53:39,400
Has she been in anything?

1153
00:53:40,367 --> 00:53:43,100
Oh, I don't know.
I think she takes classes.

1154
00:53:43,267 --> 00:53:45,067
Oh she does take class? Oh.

1155
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,433
You think she's pretty?

1156
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,567
Yeah, of course she is.
She's beautiful.

1157
00:53:48,733 --> 00:53:49,500
She's Jane's sister.

1158
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,467
But what's with these games
she wants us to play?

1159
00:53:52,633 --> 00:53:54,300
Stand up and
give advice to the bride?

1160
00:53:54,467 --> 00:53:56,067
I mean, ugh.

1161
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,600
What do you mean?
Like in front of everyone?

1162
00:53:57,767 --> 00:53:58,500
Like a speech?

1163
00:53:58,667 --> 00:53:59,367
Oh, yeah.

1164
00:54:00,433 --> 00:54:01,433
What are you going to say?

1165
00:54:01,867 --> 00:54:04,067
Oh, she won't wanna hear
my advice, believe you me.

1166
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:07,733
I'm going to have to leave soon
before that starts.

1167
00:54:08,933 --> 00:54:10,533
And what advice
would that be exactly, huh?

1168
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,367
I suppose you have something
against Derek?

1169
00:54:15,067 --> 00:54:15,767
What was that?

1170
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,900
What was that? What is it?

1171
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:19,767
Tell me.

1172
00:54:20,333 --> 00:54:22,267
Margaret, what is it going on?

1173
00:54:23,433 --> 00:54:26,067
- [women chattering]
- [music continues]

1174
00:54:33,867 --> 00:54:35,300
What is it, that you were
looking at each other?

1175
00:54:35,467 --> 00:54:38,400
It's um, I just think she's uh,

1176
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:39,700
she's too good for him.

1177
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,267
That's your big secret?

1178
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:44,067
That's it?

1179
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:45,400
Okay. Okay.

1180
00:54:45,767 --> 00:54:47,433
Mm. You want to know
the real reason?

1181
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,200
Yes.

1182
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,233
It's got nothing to do
with Derek, it's Jane.

1183
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,200
Have you noticed? She's a freak.

1184
00:54:52,367 --> 00:54:53,100
Have you seen her?

1185
00:54:53,967 --> 00:54:54,400
Have you looked at her
in the office?

1186
00:54:55,267 --> 00:54:56,167
She's like this
fluffy stuffed animal

1187
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:57,600
with these big, dead eyes

1188
00:54:57,767 --> 00:54:59,600
just going through the motions,
you know?

1189
00:54:59,767 --> 00:55:01,300
That's what she's doing
with this wedding.

1190
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,733
She's getting married
just to get married.

1191
00:55:04,233 --> 00:55:05,733
Like that's her only option.

1192
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,700
Like that's what
she's supposed to do, you know?

1193
00:55:08,867 --> 00:55:11,900
All right,
first of all, Margaret,

1194
00:55:12,933 --> 00:55:16,067
that is what most people
do do, okay?

1195
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:18,400
Our Jane
has found herself a fella

1196
00:55:18,567 --> 00:55:19,900
who gives her things, okay?

1197
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,267
And he's got good taste, too.

1198
00:55:21,433 --> 00:55:24,300
No, he gives her candy
and flowers and jewelry--

1199
00:55:24,467 --> 00:55:26,067
Oh, well that's
a whole hell of a lot.

1200
00:55:26,167 --> 00:55:26,833
That's a lot.

1201
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,067
You notice it's right after
he's blown her off?

1202
00:55:29,467 --> 00:55:31,433
Derek forgot
to pick me up today.

1203
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,433
Bing, she gets a necklace.

1204
00:55:34,333 --> 00:55:35,433
A cheap necklace at that.

1205
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,433
All right, no, you know what?

1206
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,667
You have to lighten up because
we're at a party, all right?

1207
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:40,667
Excuse me.

1208
00:55:42,067 --> 00:55:43,067
Here, honey.

1209
00:55:44,367 --> 00:55:47,067
- [soft music]
- [phones ringing]

1210
00:55:49,733 --> 00:55:51,733
[Iris] <i>Just when I was hoping</i>
things would settle down,</i>

1211
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:52,733
<i>Louise showed up.</i>

1212
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:57,700
Hi.

1213
00:55:58,733 --> 00:56:00,967
<i>It wasn't her fault,</i>
but she was a permanent,</i>

1214
00:56:01,133 --> 00:56:02,333
<i>and so I moved.</i>

1215
00:56:05,133 --> 00:56:06,667
<i>Items began to vanish again.</i>

1216
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,067
<i>There were new rules</i>
put into effect.</i>

1217
00:56:12,067 --> 00:56:14,367
<i>Routine socializing</i>
was frowned upon,</i>

1218
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,233
<i>locks appeared</i>
on the kitchen cupboards.</i>

1219
00:56:18,933 --> 00:56:20,633
<i>We did our best</i>
to pretend we were busy.</i>

1220
00:56:21,067 --> 00:56:21,967
<i>We played our parts.</i>

1221
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,100
<i>And we wondered what lay ahead</i>

1222
00:56:26,433 --> 00:56:28,467
<i>just around the corner,</i>
waiting for us.</i>

1223
00:56:33,067 --> 00:56:34,767
- [soft music]
- [people chattering]

1224
00:56:38,267 --> 00:56:39,833
It's so creepy here now,
you know?

1225
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:41,800
I feel like
I'm up to something, right?

1226
00:56:42,133 --> 00:56:42,767
Hm.

1227
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:44,833
I'm thinking about asking
the agency for a transfer.

1228
00:56:45,967 --> 00:56:47,367
Yeah, even if it's only
for two months, I don't care.

1229
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:49,167
Don't bother, I already tried.

1230
00:56:51,467 --> 00:56:53,433
'Cause of my rehearsal schedule,
you know?

1231
00:56:54,067 --> 00:56:56,067
Anyway, the agency said that
there's no work right now.

1232
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,567
It's just, it's really slow.

1233
00:56:58,067 --> 00:56:59,333
I--I gotta keep on working.

1234
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,500
I mean, I owe money on a wedding

1235
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,167
I haven't even had yet.
[chuckles]

1236
00:57:02,433 --> 00:57:04,067
If we leave now, we'll never
know how things turn out

1237
00:57:04,167 --> 00:57:05,533
with all this stealing.

1238
00:57:06,067 --> 00:57:07,333
Don't you want to know
how it ends?

1239
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,333
Yeah, and if we leave now,

1240
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:11,233
I bet that sneaky little bitch
would stop her thievery,

1241
00:57:11,533 --> 00:57:13,233
and what's that gonna look like?

1242
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,833
Like we're guilty.

1243
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,067
That's right.

1244
00:57:22,367 --> 00:57:25,200
I'm not leaving.
Not without a recommendation.

1245
00:57:25,367 --> 00:57:27,733
I was here first.
I'm staying right where I am.

1246
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,500
[soft music]

1247
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:38,300
[whispering] Iris, I just
figured something out.

1248
00:57:38,467 --> 00:57:40,333
I think I know what
her next move is gonna be.

1249
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,867
I was thinking to myself,
what would I do

1250
00:57:42,067 --> 00:57:43,267
if I were the one stealing?

1251
00:57:43,633 --> 00:57:45,367
I'd say something of mine
was missing

1252
00:57:45,533 --> 00:57:47,633
to deflect attention
like I was a victim.

1253
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,067
I mean,
I'm no phony fortune teller,

1254
00:57:49,167 --> 00:57:51,533
but I can tell you one thing,
whoever's doing the stealing,

1255
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,233
is gonna say something of theirs
has disappeared.

1256
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,833
It's gonna be
a sure sign of their guilt.

1257
00:57:55,067 --> 00:57:56,800
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

1258
00:57:57,467 --> 00:57:58,133
[man over intercom] <i>Attention.</i>

1259
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,900
<i>No unauthorized personnel</i>

1260
00:58:00,133 --> 00:58:02,067
<i>allowed on this floor</i>
after five.</i>

1261
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,633
See, Iris look,
didn't I tell you? Guilty.

1262
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:09,867
Guilty as charged.

1263
00:58:13,667 --> 00:58:14,933
My scarf is missing.

1264
00:58:16,067 --> 00:58:18,233
You know,
the one you were all admiring.

1265
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,667
So if any of you happen
to see it, let me know.

1266
00:58:25,167 --> 00:58:26,733
[Jane] Why was she
looking at us like that?

1267
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:27,833
[Margaret]
She thinks it's one of us.

1268
00:58:28,933 --> 00:58:29,400
[Jane] I never said anything
about her stupid scarf.

1269
00:58:30,533 --> 00:58:31,333
Hey, it doesn't matter.
To her we're interchangeable.

1270
00:58:32,533 --> 00:58:33,367
She always sees us together.
She doesn't know who's who.

1271
00:58:33,533 --> 00:58:34,933
But why would she think
it's one of us?

1272
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,100
'Cause we're temps.

1273
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,367
I mean, you heard what
Kilmer said at that meeting.

1274
00:58:38,533 --> 00:58:40,433
That crap about
us all being a family?

1275
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,933
Well guess what? We're not part
of their office family

1276
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:44,433
and I don't want to be anyway.

1277
00:58:44,767 --> 00:58:45,900
I mean we're like,
temps are like,

1278
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,667
we're like corporate orphans.

1279
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:49,467
We're like corporate call girls.

1280
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,667
We don't belong and that's what
makes us suspects, okay?

1281
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:05,633
Those are our desks.

1282
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,067
Huh.

1283
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:10,333
What a coincidence.

1284
00:59:12,067 --> 00:59:13,667
The only temps on this floor.

1285
00:59:14,767 --> 00:59:17,333
Shove us together where
they can keep an eye on us.

1286
00:59:18,933 --> 00:59:21,267
Could stare at us all day
through these glass walls

1287
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:22,700
for their own sick amusement.

1288
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,067
We're in a goddamn fish bowl.

1289
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,400
- [soft music]
- [phones ringing]

1290
00:59:38,433 --> 00:59:40,900
Ooh,
the staple isn't horizontal.

1291
00:59:41,067 --> 00:59:41,967
Let's try to keep it neat.

1292
00:59:42,133 --> 00:59:43,800
These are going
to important clients.

1293
00:59:56,833 --> 00:59:58,267
Paula, do you have a pen?

1294
00:59:58,433 --> 00:59:59,167
Mine just ran out.

1295
00:59:59,533 --> 01:00:00,367
Cut it out, will ya?

1296
01:00:00,533 --> 01:00:01,833
Someone might see us talking.

1297
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,000
[phone ringing]

1298
01:00:07,033 --> 01:00:07,633
Credit.

1299
01:00:08,367 --> 01:00:09,400
Could you hand me a pen please?

1300
01:00:09,833 --> 01:00:10,700
You know what? I'm all out.

1301
01:00:10,867 --> 01:00:11,733
Mine keep disappearing.

1302
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,200
I can't even find
my Jack Shoberg.

1303
01:00:13,367 --> 01:00:14,400
Here, you can take mine.

1304
01:00:14,567 --> 01:00:15,567
It's not very sharp,
but you can have it.

1305
01:00:15,733 --> 01:00:17,400
No that's all right, Iris.
You need it.

1306
01:00:17,667 --> 01:00:20,033
Just take a look at the desk
in front of you, please, Paula.

1307
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,600
I am not about to go
picking through

1308
01:00:21,767 --> 01:00:22,733
somebody else's desk, uh-uh.

1309
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:23,867
No one is sitting there.

1310
01:00:24,033 --> 01:00:25,100
Somebody might see me.

1311
01:00:25,267 --> 01:00:27,100
Well you're the one who always
wanted an audience.

1312
01:00:28,567 --> 01:00:29,300
You know what?

1313
01:00:30,567 --> 01:00:31,667
Just 'cause you're loud doesn't
mean people have to listen.

1314
01:00:31,833 --> 01:00:33,067
[Margaret]
What's that supposed to mean?

1315
01:00:33,233 --> 01:00:34,167
[Paula] Nothing. Nothing.

1316
01:00:34,333 --> 01:00:35,100
It's just that...

1317
01:00:36,567 --> 01:00:38,133
I'm not the one who's always
trying to stir things up

1318
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,167
around here, okay?

1319
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:40,433
I haven't done anything wrong.

1320
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:41,167
[Margaret] Oh, really?

1321
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:42,967
I have two words for you:
copy machine.

1322
01:00:44,133 --> 01:00:44,700
[phone slams]

1323
01:00:46,133 --> 01:00:47,300
[Jane whispering]
Please be quiet.

1324
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:48,833
All right?

1325
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,067
You're gonna
get us all in trouble.

1326
01:00:51,233 --> 01:00:52,867
[Margaret] I wouldn't point
fingers if I were you, okay?

1327
01:00:53,033 --> 01:00:54,600
You're the one who is always
making personal calls.

1328
01:00:54,767 --> 01:00:55,433
[Jane] You're just saying that

1329
01:00:56,233 --> 01:00:56,733
because you guys
don't like Derek.

1330
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:57,867
[chair squeaks]

1331
01:01:00,133 --> 01:01:01,267
One of you took my chair.

1332
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:04,167
[music continues]

1333
01:01:08,167 --> 01:01:09,367
Can I have something
to write with?

1334
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,633
But I gave you
a number two pencil yesterday.

1335
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:16,967
Art, please.

1336
01:01:17,633 --> 01:01:18,900
I'm in no mood, okay?

1337
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:28,133
Oh, come on, five or six.
I'm on a big project.

1338
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,900
[Margaret grunts]

1339
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,467
[music continues]

1340
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:10,967
Oh, damn this music.

1341
01:02:11,767 --> 01:02:13,500
They're trying to
mess with our heads.

1342
01:02:19,133 --> 01:02:20,167
I'm going to lunch.

1343
01:02:20,667 --> 01:02:21,533
Is anyone coming?

1344
01:02:22,067 --> 01:02:22,967
[Paula] I'm on a diet.

1345
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,600
[Margaret] Guess I'll cancel
our reservations for four then

1346
01:02:25,767 --> 01:02:27,100
down at the cafeteria, Paula.

1347
01:02:27,267 --> 01:02:28,600
[Jane] I'm going on a lunch date
with Derek.

1348
01:02:28,933 --> 01:02:29,767
- Bye.
- Bye.

1349
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,433
[whispering]
Hey, Louise, it's lunch time.

1350
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,433
You wanna smoke some pot?

1351
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:42,633
[music continues]

1352
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:48,233
[clears throat]

1353
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,467
[water dripping]

1354
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:55,767
[door opens]

1355
01:03:03,067 --> 01:03:04,100
[stall door closes, locks]

1356
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:13,333
[rustling]

1357
01:03:18,433 --> 01:03:21,800
[woman coughs]

1358
01:03:25,567 --> 01:03:27,333
[water splashes]

1359
01:03:31,233 --> 01:03:33,100
[woman coughing]

1360
01:03:43,633 --> 01:03:45,733
[toilet flushes]

1361
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,067
Are you all right?

1362
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:00,867
No.

1363
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,867
I'm pregnant, I think.

1364
01:04:08,933 --> 01:04:09,800
Well, have you been to a doctor?

1365
01:04:09,967 --> 01:04:11,600
You should really see a doctor.

1366
01:04:12,467 --> 01:04:14,300
Yeah.
I have an appointment tomorrow.

1367
01:04:14,567 --> 01:04:15,600
I cleared it with Barbara.

1368
01:04:16,067 --> 01:04:16,767
So, believe me,

1369
01:04:17,733 --> 01:04:18,667
this is the last thing
I can afford right now.

1370
01:04:20,067 --> 01:04:22,600
Well if you need any money,
I have some saved.

1371
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:24,333
Um, I got it covered.

1372
01:04:24,667 --> 01:04:25,333
Thanks.

1373
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,067
Um, you know what?

1374
01:04:27,833 --> 01:04:28,667
Just forget
I even said anything.

1375
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,633
Probably shouldn't have
even told anybody.

1376
01:04:36,667 --> 01:04:39,667
[people chattering]

1377
01:04:58,233 --> 01:04:59,300
[Iris] Uh, Paula?

1378
01:05:02,133 --> 01:05:04,533
[soft music]

1379
01:05:14,433 --> 01:05:15,433
Kilmer's wallet was stolen.

1380
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,767
He noticed last night.

1381
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,800
There was a lot of money
in it, too.

1382
01:05:20,067 --> 01:05:21,100
You see those guards in there?

1383
01:05:22,267 --> 01:05:23,500
They're starting
to interview people.

1384
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:25,833
They took a statement from me.

1385
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,067
They want us
to rat on each other.

1386
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:34,200
You get it?
It's the old divide and conquer.

1387
01:05:34,367 --> 01:05:35,700
They're trying
to split us apart.

1388
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:39,833
Where's Paula?
She get her stupid transfer?

1389
01:05:40,367 --> 01:05:41,567
Maybe she has a rehearsal.

1390
01:05:41,867 --> 01:05:43,467
Iris. [sighs]

1391
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:45,567
There's no rehearsal,
don't you get it?

1392
01:05:46,167 --> 01:05:48,167
It's all in that
sad, little head of hers.

1393
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,233
You'll see when
you try to go to the show,

1394
01:05:51,533 --> 01:05:54,200
and she'll mysteriously
disappear, just like last time.

1395
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:58,800
I wonder what else
Camille's been lying about.

1396
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,100
Hm.

1397
01:06:02,733 --> 01:06:04,067
Oh, shit.

1398
01:06:12,167 --> 01:06:14,500
[Jane whispering] 71, 72...

1399
01:06:16,367 --> 01:06:21,767
73, 74, 75, 76...

1400
01:06:22,267 --> 01:06:25,467
77, 78, 79, 80...

1401
01:06:26,133 --> 01:06:30,900
81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87...

1402
01:06:31,933 --> 01:06:32,500
[Iris] <i>Paula.</i>

1403
01:06:33,433 --> 01:06:34,167
Hey.

1404
01:06:35,067 --> 01:06:35,500
Did you get my message
the other night?

1405
01:06:36,067 --> 01:06:37,300
Yeah. Ooh, thank you.

1406
01:06:39,467 --> 01:06:41,300
My whole life is here.
[chuckles]

1407
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:43,800
Why didn't you call?

1408
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:46,533
I was worried, and then when
you didn't show up yesterday.

1409
01:06:47,067 --> 01:06:48,533
Shh, shh, yeah.

1410
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:51,833
Um, I just, I got a lot going on
right now, remember?

1411
01:06:52,067 --> 01:06:52,767
- Yeah.
- You know?

1412
01:06:53,067 --> 01:06:54,500
- Rehearsals and...
- Yeah.

1413
01:06:55,833 --> 01:06:56,900
Everything.

1414
01:06:58,233 --> 01:06:58,900
You want some?

1415
01:06:59,067 --> 01:07:00,133
Oh no, thanks.

1416
01:07:04,633 --> 01:07:05,767
Why are you looking at me funny?

1417
01:07:07,067 --> 01:07:08,767
No, I'm not,
I'm not, I'm not looking.

1418
01:07:09,733 --> 01:07:10,400
I get it.

1419
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:13,967
My mother knows someone
in cosmetics.

1420
01:07:14,133 --> 01:07:14,700
- No, I--
- Okay?

1421
01:07:15,567 --> 01:07:16,367
Sometimes she gives me
free samples.

1422
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:21,367
[soft music]

1423
01:07:22,067 --> 01:07:25,900
I mean, it's--it's fucking
perfume, anyway, right?

1424
01:07:30,067 --> 01:07:31,200
[laughs] Nice flowers.

1425
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:33,900
What are you so depressed about?

1426
01:07:34,267 --> 01:07:35,933
You have a boyfriend,
you're getting married.

1427
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:38,067
At least you have a way
out of this place.

1428
01:07:38,767 --> 01:07:40,067
[Jane whispering]
Iris, I'm scared.

1429
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:42,700
I think I was here late

1430
01:07:43,833 --> 01:07:44,700
the night Kilmer's wallet
was stolen, I don't know.

1431
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,133
I can't remember.

1432
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,833
I--maybe I blacked out
or something, but,

1433
01:07:49,067 --> 01:07:49,800
I think I'm the guilty one.

1434
01:07:49,967 --> 01:07:51,067
I think I did it.

1435
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,300
- Don't say that.
- I've been looking.

1436
01:07:53,533 --> 01:07:54,200
I've been looking for that
wallet like all over the place,

1437
01:07:55,133 --> 01:07:56,333
you know, and
I can't find it anywhere.

1438
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,500
God, I don't know,
I don't know anything anymore.

1439
01:08:02,167 --> 01:08:03,967
How do you know something?

1440
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:08,533
How do you know
anything for sure?

1441
01:08:10,333 --> 01:08:11,267
I don't know.

1442
01:08:13,967 --> 01:08:14,633
[Jane clears throat]

1443
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,600
I don't know.

1444
01:08:17,133 --> 01:08:19,800
[soft music]

1445
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:33,933
[Iris] <i>It's funny</i>
how doubt hides itself.</i>

1446
01:08:35,633 --> 01:08:37,133
<i>It follows behind you.</i>

1447
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:39,867
<i>It waits in every corner.</i>

1448
01:08:41,267 --> 01:08:45,167
<i>You never see it coming,</i>
but you feel it on the inside.</i>

1449
01:08:47,067 --> 01:08:48,733
<i>Maybe it was just that office,</i>

1450
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:50,167
<i>or maybe</i>
it was bigger than that.</i>

1451
01:08:51,333 --> 01:08:56,533
<i>It was all around, a million</i>
eyes watching, judging.</i>

1452
01:08:57,533 --> 01:08:58,967
<i>The whole wide world, even.</i>

1453
01:09:00,967 --> 01:09:02,633
<i>You feel so small.</i>

1454
01:09:09,067 --> 01:09:12,067
[soft, tense music]

1455
01:09:20,667 --> 01:09:22,533
[machine whirring]

1456
01:09:37,533 --> 01:09:39,267
[phones ringing]

1457
01:09:44,933 --> 01:09:46,233
Could you come with me, please?

1458
01:09:49,167 --> 01:09:51,600
[soft music]

1459
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,133
[Barbara] We have a certain
standard of grooming

1460
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:04,533
we expect our employees
to adhere to

1461
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,367
and your skirt hem is hanging.

1462
01:10:07,867 --> 01:10:09,867
I hope this isn't
going to be a problem.

1463
01:10:10,367 --> 01:10:12,833
I really--I hate to have
to replace people.

1464
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:16,733
Yes ma'am.

1465
01:10:18,533 --> 01:10:20,933
[soft music]

1466
01:10:24,867 --> 01:10:25,767
[Margaret] Hey, Iris.

1467
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:27,767
[whispering]
What'd she tell you?

1468
01:10:37,167 --> 01:10:38,167
Okay, don't tell me.

1469
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,000
Just write it down in that
little notebook of yours.

1470
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:44,033
That's fine.

1471
01:10:53,867 --> 01:10:55,200
[stapler clinking]

1472
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:09,333
- [lights buzzing]
- [soft, muted music]

1473
01:11:37,333 --> 01:11:38,633
[man] <i>Do you know anybody here</i>

1474
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,967
that might have
a financial need?

1475
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:46,100
No.

1476
01:11:46,667 --> 01:11:47,867
How about a grievance?

1477
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:51,200
You hear any complaints
about the working environment

1478
01:11:51,367 --> 01:11:52,900
or other personnel?

1479
01:11:55,367 --> 01:11:56,733
Anybody that's unhappy?

1480
01:12:03,633 --> 01:12:04,600
Let me ask you this:

1481
01:12:06,133 --> 01:12:07,767
how well do you know
your coworkers?

1482
01:12:07,933 --> 01:12:10,300
Because a situation like this,

1483
01:12:10,667 --> 01:12:12,533
your perpetrator
could be anybody.

1484
01:12:13,167 --> 01:12:17,133
It could be somebody
you know very little about

1485
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:22,067
or it might be somebody
you think you know very well.

1486
01:12:38,967 --> 01:12:39,567
Um, listen.

1487
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,600
That problem
I told you about before,

1488
01:12:41,767 --> 01:12:42,767
it was a false alarm.

1489
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,333
I thought you should know.

1490
01:12:48,267 --> 01:12:49,100
[Iris gasps]

1491
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:51,167
Oh no.

1492
01:12:52,633 --> 01:12:53,833
Oh, I forgot something.

1493
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:58,067
[soft music]

1494
01:13:00,067 --> 01:13:00,633
- [man] Excuse me.
- [gasps]

1495
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:01,733
You can't go up there.

1496
01:13:02,233 --> 01:13:03,067
I left my notebook up there.

1497
01:13:03,267 --> 01:13:04,367
It's after five o'clock, ma'am.

1498
01:13:04,733 --> 01:13:05,900
You'll have to come back
in the morning.

1499
01:13:06,433 --> 01:13:07,233
Floor's closed.

1500
01:13:22,833 --> 01:13:24,567
[Margaret] That ought to be
worth another meeting.

1501
01:13:29,167 --> 01:13:30,467
[soft music]

1502
01:13:30,633 --> 01:13:31,700
What the hell?

1503
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:34,700
What?

1504
01:13:35,567 --> 01:13:36,600
Did you see a notebook in there?

1505
01:13:37,067 --> 01:13:37,900
[man] If you'd like to
report it missing,

1506
01:13:38,067 --> 01:13:38,900
we can add to the list.

1507
01:13:39,167 --> 01:13:39,767
[Margaret] Excuse me, sir.

1508
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:41,400
Those are someone's
personal belongings.

1509
01:13:41,567 --> 01:13:42,267
What are you doing?

1510
01:13:42,467 --> 01:13:43,467
Routine desk service, lady.

1511
01:13:43,633 --> 01:13:45,067
Oh routine, my butt.

1512
01:13:45,767 --> 01:13:47,867
Yeah. Why'd you pick
these desks to search?

1513
01:13:48,267 --> 01:13:49,967
You know,
why not that one over there?

1514
01:13:50,133 --> 01:13:54,067
Cleo's desk, Cleo with a C,
a big gold C.

1515
01:13:56,767 --> 01:13:58,833
Why is she above suspicion, huh?

1516
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,367
And you know what they're doin'.

1517
01:14:02,867 --> 01:14:05,333
Trying to make us feel guilty
so they can control us.

1518
01:14:06,433 --> 01:14:08,067
[Paula] The just want us to feel
crappy about ourselves.

1519
01:14:08,233 --> 01:14:08,800
[Margaret] Yeah.

1520
01:14:09,633 --> 01:14:10,367
Yeah,
and doubt everything we do.

1521
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:11,967
That's it, I'm sick of it.

1522
01:14:12,133 --> 01:14:13,767
I'm sick of being treated
like a criminal.

1523
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:15,100
I mean that plan we had,

1524
01:14:16,067 --> 01:14:16,667
I think it's time
we follow through with it.

1525
01:14:16,833 --> 01:14:17,767
Let's not show up tomorrow.

1526
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:19,100
See what happens then.

1527
01:14:19,267 --> 01:14:20,467
- Is everyone in?
- [Jane] Yeah, sure.

1528
01:14:20,633 --> 01:14:21,767
- [Paula] Mm-hm.
- [Margaret] Yeah.

1529
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,500
[soft, upbeat music]

1530
01:14:34,567 --> 01:14:36,233
Sir, please don't touch those.

1531
01:14:37,133 --> 01:14:38,367
Oh, look, my finger puppet.

1532
01:14:38,533 --> 01:14:40,733
Incriminating evidence.
[scoffs]

1533
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:43,067
Just a bunch of toys.

1534
01:14:46,067 --> 01:14:48,200
As a group, we could
really make a big statement.

1535
01:14:49,533 --> 01:14:52,733
It's a risk, but you gotta
take a risk to be noticed.

1536
01:14:53,067 --> 01:14:54,233
They can't treat us this way

1537
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,233
and they can't crush us
down into silence.

1538
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:57,333
Barbara's coming.

1539
01:14:58,467 --> 01:15:01,733
[Margaret]
Oh, tomorrow, we strike.

1540
01:15:17,233 --> 01:15:19,633
[soft music]

1541
01:15:43,067 --> 01:15:45,333
Hm, I uh, got scared.

1542
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,333
I've never missed a day before.

1543
01:15:49,167 --> 01:15:50,067
I changed my mind.

1544
01:15:54,867 --> 01:15:56,900
[soft music]

1545
01:16:01,433 --> 01:16:02,500
You know what,
I don't know about you guys,

1546
01:16:02,667 --> 01:16:04,300
but I need this job, you know?

1547
01:16:04,467 --> 01:16:05,400
It's the little I've got.

1548
01:16:13,767 --> 01:16:15,267
Besides, do you know
what I was thinking?

1549
01:16:15,933 --> 01:16:17,267
Maybe it's not her, you know?

1550
01:16:17,433 --> 01:16:19,567
Maybe that's just what
somebody wants us to think.

1551
01:16:22,767 --> 01:16:25,533
- [music continues]
- [people chattering]

1552
01:16:27,767 --> 01:16:28,800
[Paula]
You know what that cop told me?

1553
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:30,233
He said the guilty one

1554
01:16:31,167 --> 01:16:31,933
is always the first one
to point fingers.

1555
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:35,567
Now maybe people
will stop looking

1556
01:16:35,733 --> 01:16:36,867
at me all the time, you know?

1557
01:16:41,167 --> 01:16:42,200
Where's the other one?

1558
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,433
Um, I don't know.

1559
01:16:46,533 --> 01:16:48,833
Hm,
that's not very professional.

1560
01:16:49,067 --> 01:16:50,167
She knows company policy.

1561
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,700
You're supposed to call in
if you're absent or late.

1562
01:16:53,533 --> 01:16:55,100
I think she's done this before.

1563
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:59,067
[music continues]

1564
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:12,967
[soft acoustic music]

1565
01:17:17,533 --> 01:17:19,700
[Iris] <i>I wish I could tell you</i>
I never doubted a friend.</i>

1566
01:17:20,733 --> 01:17:21,600
<i>I wish I could say that place</i>

1567
01:17:21,767 --> 01:17:23,367
<i>hadn't gotten the better of us,</i>

1568
01:17:25,233 --> 01:17:26,467
<i>but that's not the way</i>
it happened.</i>

1569
01:17:31,733 --> 01:17:32,900
<i>Sometimes it hits you</i>

1570
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:35,567
<i>how quickly the present</i>
fades into the past,</i>

1571
01:17:37,433 --> 01:17:39,100
<i>and you question everything</i>
around you.</i>

1572
01:17:40,667 --> 01:17:42,967
<i>You wonder if anything</i>
you'd ever do would matter,</i>

1573
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,533
<i>or if you could just</i>
disappear without a trace.</i>

1574
01:17:49,667 --> 01:17:50,333
Hey.

1575
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,200
I thought about this crazy place
all day yesterday.

1576
01:17:53,367 --> 01:17:54,333
I can't wait to hear
what happened.

1577
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:56,633
They had to have noticed, right?
[chuckles]

1578
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:58,067
They noticed.

1579
01:18:00,767 --> 01:18:02,267
Did you chicken out
or something?

1580
01:18:03,667 --> 01:18:04,900
Paula, what happened?

1581
01:18:05,133 --> 01:18:07,067
Look, if I were you, I would
keep my voice down, okay?

1582
01:18:07,233 --> 01:18:08,867
'Cause you are in
a shitload of trouble.

1583
01:18:16,167 --> 01:18:17,067
What happened?

1584
01:18:19,833 --> 01:18:24,167
I guess ...m just not like you.

1585
01:18:29,733 --> 01:18:30,667
You know, it's sad, isn't it?

1586
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:32,867
How people always
end up betraying each other?

1587
01:18:34,267 --> 01:18:35,200
And for what?

1588
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,700
You can read this
while you're waiting.

1589
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:41,933
Excuse me.

1590
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,633
You're in my seat.

1591
01:18:44,067 --> 01:18:45,833
There's a vacancy
over there, though.

1592
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:52,367
Um, we won't be needing you
here anymore.

1593
01:18:53,333 --> 01:18:55,067
Oh. [coughs]

1594
01:18:55,167 --> 01:18:57,433
I was really sick yesterday,
Barbara, but I'm better now.

1595
01:18:57,767 --> 01:18:58,567
Okay, okay.

1596
01:18:58,733 --> 01:19:00,100
Let's not have a scene.

1597
01:19:00,267 --> 01:19:01,533
You aren't needed.

1598
01:19:02,567 --> 01:19:03,567
You're firing me?

1599
01:19:04,967 --> 01:19:05,800
How can you fire me?

1600
01:19:05,967 --> 01:19:07,133
You don't even know my name.

1601
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:08,333
Go on, now, do as the lady says.

1602
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:09,333
Take your stuff and leave.

1603
01:19:10,933 --> 01:19:12,133
Oh, I get it.

1604
01:19:12,733 --> 01:19:15,867
Oh, you think
I'm your little office thief.

1605
01:19:16,067 --> 01:19:17,700
Oh, well you got me.

1606
01:19:17,867 --> 01:19:19,867
You finally got me.

1607
01:19:20,067 --> 01:19:21,533
- Yeah.
- Come on, you got 15 seconds.

1608
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:22,500
- Let's go.
- [Margaret] Stop it!

1609
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:23,533
- [guard] Come on now.
- Would you just let go?

1610
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:25,400
Can't you see
I'm trying to get my stuff?

1611
01:19:25,867 --> 01:19:27,167
Can I get my stuff?

1612
01:19:28,467 --> 01:19:29,333
Thank you.

1613
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,600
I have things, you know?

1614
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:38,233
Is anyone gonna say anything?

1615
01:19:41,633 --> 01:19:42,767
You know I'm not a thief.

1616
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,933
Is anyone gonna say anything?

1617
01:19:51,667 --> 01:19:53,433
Is anyone gonna say anything?

1618
01:19:55,333 --> 01:19:57,667
Isn't anyone
gonna stick up for me?

1619
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,633
Is anyone gonna speak?

1620
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:07,033
I have a name, you know.

1621
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,233
It's Margaret

1622
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:11,633
Margaret with an M.
Take a memo, Barbara.

1623
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,600
[people chattering]

that moment to live over.</i>

1626

<i>I wish I had said something.</i>

1627
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,233
<i>Soon afterward, Jane left.</i>

1628
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,267
<i>The wedding was beautiful.</i>

1629
01:20:35,467 --> 01:20:37,000
<i>I read about it</i>
in the newspaper.</i>

1630

[soft music]

1631
01:20:39,967 --> 01:20:42,333
<i>Paula got transferred</i>
to the accounting department.</i>

1632
01:20:42,767 --> 01:20:44,700
<i>Once in a while,</i>
they let her out to photocopy.</i>

1633
01:20:45,533 --> 01:20:47,500
<i>I like to imagine</i>
she kept up her singing.</i>

1634
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:54,000
<i>I had to change desks</i>
a few more times.</i>

1635
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,833
<i>It was easier to forget</i>
where I was that way.</i>

1636
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:02,667
<i>And there was something else,</i>
the stealing stopped.</i>

1637
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:05,500
<i>I was almost beginning to think</i>
none of it had happened.</i>

1638
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:13,733
[Iris sighs]

1639
01:21:20,233 --> 01:21:21,733
[music continues]

1640
01:21:53,167 --> 01:21:55,400
<i>Sometimes I thought about</i>
what Margaret said,</i>

1641
01:21:57,567 --> 01:21:59,867
<i>about how a person can</i>
just drift through life,</i>

1642
01:22:00,433 --> 01:22:03,600
<i>like they're not connected</i>
to anyone or anything.</i>

1643
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:09,300
<i>You look around.</i>

1644
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,633
<i>All those characters</i>
trying to kill time,</i>

1645
01:22:14,133 --> 01:22:15,500
<i>going around in circles.</i>

1646
01:22:20,733 --> 01:22:22,700
<i>Even if a person wanted</i>
to break free,</i>

1647
01:22:25,467 --> 01:22:27,700
<i>they could find out</i>
they've got nowhere else to go.</i>

1648
01:23:09,133 --> 01:23:10,467
Listen, I'm going to be
in a meeting shortly,

1649
01:23:10,633 --> 01:23:12,667
so when you're done
just pop 'em in the office.

1650
01:23:12,967 --> 01:23:13,633
Thanks.

<i>We didn't have to.</i>

1655
01:23:45,733 --> 01:23:46,800

Mm-hm.

Uh, this is my last day here,

give me a recommendation?

I'd be glad to.

1684
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:52,067
Oh, well actually
I've already written something,

1685
01:29:52,167 --> 01:29:53,167
if you could just sign it?

1686
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:04,467
Well, you've certainly
been a big help here.
