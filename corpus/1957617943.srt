- So, Craig, what makes you think you need

11
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,600
to see a therapist?

12
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,737
- I'm as confused as an infant at a topless bar.

13
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:12,739
- Okay.

14
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,275
Okay.

15
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,111
What seems to be the source of all this confusion?

16
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,947
- Well, I know you might not get this, dude,

17
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:24,350
but I'm having a hard time with the babes.

18
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,587
- Women, yeah, that's very common.

19
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:30,390
You have a difficult time

20
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,460
relating with women, understanding them?

21
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,529
- You see, Doctor, I understand them,

22
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:39,165
they just can't understand me.

23
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:42,001
- Craig, I'm gonna cut to the chase right here.

24
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,570
Are you schizophrenic?

25
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,572
- No, I'm a standup comedian.

26
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:49,142
(jazzy music)

27
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:57,083
- Craig, you obviously create these characters

28
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,352
because you're uncomfortable with who you are.

29
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,555
- You're very good.

30
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:03,890
- Thank you.

31
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,392
(jazzy music)

32
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,766
- Now, how long have you been behaving this way?

33
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,635
- My entire life.

34
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,569
[Craig] I grew up with my sister,

35
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,204
my mother and my grandmother.

36
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:21,040
[Craig] There weren't exactly a lot of G.I. Joes around,

37
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,943
so I had to come up with unusual ways to entertain myself.

38
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:29,782
- Hey Suzie, hey Suzie!

39
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,951
Hey, Suzie, Suzie look, who am I?

40
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,220
- Get out you creep.

41
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,255
- Ruh-roh.

42
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,423
- Craig, give me those.

43
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,058
- I'm Astro Jetson.

44
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:40,460
- I said get out.

45
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:48,434
- Hey, hey Mom, hey Mom, Mom look, who am I?

46
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,305
- Not now, sweetie, I'm practicing.

47
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,609
- I'm the fly.

48
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,811
- Oh, precious (kisses)

49
00:02:58,811 --> 00:02:59,979
Later, sweetie.

50
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,250
- Hey Nana, Nana, look, Nana, who am I?

51
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:10,089
I'll get you my little pretty, and your little dog, too.

52
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:15,395
- Come back in a little while, sweetie, I'm a tad busy now.

53
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,263
- I'm the Wicked Witch of the West.

54
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,871
- I'm as damp as a dishrag, what are you wearing?

55
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,843
- Craig, I wanna try and experiment here.

56
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:33,713
Just for once I'd like you to drop all these facades

57
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,782
and concentrate on just being you.

58
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,184
- Yeah, but that's the problem,

59
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:40,420
people don't want me to be me.

60
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,922
(jazzy music)

61
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,659
- Here we're going to explore your life, not your act.

62
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:51,130
- Well, you don't understand, my life is my act.

63
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,701
- Alright, then let's hear your act.

64
00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:01,007
- Ladies and gentlemen here he is, the one, the only!

65
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,744
- [Announcer] Craig Shoemaker!

66
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,180
(audience cheers and applauds)

67
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,116
- Thank you, good to be here.

68
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,285
Woo!

69
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,854
Thank you, dang.

70
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,356
Alright.

71
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,724
(audience applauding)

72
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:18,825
You guys sound great, thank you.

73
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,861
Hey, would ye-.

74
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:25,632
Woo!

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,336
(audience applauding)

76
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:31,270
I could tell.

77
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,372
You're drunk, aren't you?

78
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,841
Oh, yeah.

79
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:35,775
I can tell, you get drunk, you become the woo people.

80
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,910
That alcohol hits that level,

81
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:38,745
"Woo!"

82
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,350
(audience laughing)

83
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,518
I'm fucked up.

84
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,954
It's the woo people.

85
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,155
That's a strange word, that word, woo,

86
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:50,490
means the same thing in any language.

87
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,292
Go anywhere, go over to China,

88
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,126
"Woo!"

89
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,529
"I'm fucked up."

90
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:57,997
(audience laughing)

91
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,066
So friendly, I was working in Brooklyn, New York,

92
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,567
not so friendly there.

93
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,535
They said, "Please welcome to comedy, Mr. Craig Shoemaker"

94
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:03,770
and they're all sitting there,

95
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,539
"Yo, hey, who is this asshole over here?"

96
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:07,473
"Hey, comedian, what are you doing?"

97
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,676
"Hey come on, make me laugh."

98
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,345
I said, "Listen, lady, what's your problem?"

99
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,614
"I'm doing my show up here, relax, will you?"

100
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,117
Renting' a car while I'm here.

101
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:19,552
I love renting cars,

102
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:20,820
they always give you a nice shiny car, it's great.

103
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,621
But they Armor All the seats, though.

104
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:22,855
It makes no sense.

105
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,057
You ever sit on Armor Alled seats?

106
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,091
Come around a corner, it's like, "Whoa!"

107
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,161
(audience laughs)

108
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,829
Rented a car once called the Astrovan by Chevrolet.

109
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,064
They're running out of names for cars.

110
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,266
It's named after The Jetson's dog.

111
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,867
It's a computerized car, it talks back,

112
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:36,803
you something wrong, this voice comes on,

113
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,037
(imitating Astro)

114
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,405
"You're lights are on, your lights are on."

115
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,573
(audience laughing)

116
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,408
You run out of gas, "Ruh-roh."

117
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,343
(audience laughing)

118
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:47,280
(imitates car engine)

119
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,948
They have other cartoon cars coming out this year:

120
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:51,184
The Droopy the Dogmobile will be out real soon.

121
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,719
"Oh boy, oh boy."

122
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,457
"I'm not gonna make it up that hill, you bastard."

123
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,625
(audience laughing)

124
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,794
Flew here on Southwest Airlines.

125
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,896
Ever fly that shit box airline?

126
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,665
(audience cheering)

127
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:06,499
(scoffs) Man.

128
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,402
I went up to the counter at the airport,

129
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:10,503
"How much do I owe you?!"

130
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:11,771
"Oh, chip it for gas."

131
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,272
"That'll be all right."

132
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,341
"If you wanna get out, pull the cord."

133
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:16,843
(audience laughing)

134
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,111
They always have a bird about that seat-back law,

135
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,345
they want it up for safety precautions.

136
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:20,346
You know, like there's this big difference

137
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,482
between this and this right here.

138
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,716
(audience laughing)

139
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,818
Boy, I'm living on the edge right now baby.

140
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,954
Check it out, I'm a man of danger. (chuckles)

141
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,722
Whoop, here she comes, safe and secure.

142
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,491
(audience laughing)

143
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,025
Some of these planes, the meat they give you,

144
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,594
I had this meat the other day on an airline,

145
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,329
I don't know what it was, I dropped it on my lap,

146
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,864
it started humping my leg.

147
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,966
(audience laughing)

148
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,100
Oh, you girls like that over there.

149
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,435
I saw you looking.

150
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,536
(audience cheering)

151
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,505
Come on, give me a dollar.

152
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,140
(audience cheering)

153
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,776
I just saw "Showgirls" baby, I got all the moves.

154
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:50,943
(audience cheering)

155
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:51,944
Oh, yeah.

156
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:56,816
(audience laughing)

157
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:59,118
Don't you laugh at me.

158
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,788
I'm the Lovemaster, baby.

159
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,791
(audience cheering)

160
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:09,395
Don't you laugh at the Lovemaster, yeah,

161
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:12,498
I could poke your eye out from right here, baby.

162
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,400
Yeah, come on, you hear that ringing?

163
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,969
That's a call on the bone phone, baby.

164
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,137
(audience laughing)

165
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,672
Yeah, answer the damn thing,

166
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:23,342
I ain't got call waiting, baby, I'm the Lovemaster.

167
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:25,278
Master of love, baby.

168
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,314
- What the hell was that?

169
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:30,983
- [Craig] It's the Lovemaster.

170
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,252
Now, him, the girls go crazy for.

171
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,487
(audience applauding)

172
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,922
Come on up here and walk nasty for me, baby.

173
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,524
Come climb the magic beanstalk.

174
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:39,425
(audience laughing)

175
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:42,562
Yeah, fee, fi, fo, fum,

176
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,730
lay on down and I'll make you,

177
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,233
you know what I'm gonna do for you, baby.

178
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,370
I'll love you so good, baby, you'll need an airbag.

179
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,538
(audience applauding)

180
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,407
Yeah, what you laughing at back there?

181
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,909
I'll stir your drink from right here.

182
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,144
(audience laughing)

183
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,513
Yeah, I got a drink, it's a Penis Colossus.

184
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:01,714
That's right, baby.

185
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:02,582
I'm the Lovemaster, master of love.

186
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,419
Yeah, I'm looking at you, baby.

187
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,921
Come on, tell Pinocchio a lie.

188
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,790
(audience laughing)

189
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,591
Yeah.

190
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,294
(raises pitch of voice) Oh, my God!

191
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,128
Where did that come from?

192
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:19,131
I am so sorry, just channeled through me.

193
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,703
Oh my God, a Penis Colossus, that was so gross.

194
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:24,637
(audience laughing)

195
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,539
Oh, my God, what a visual.

196
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,773
(audience laughing)

197
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,141
I'm sorry, it's gone now. (Craig chuckles)

198
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,176
Erase, erase, erase.

199
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,984
(deepens voice) Yeah, I'm back baby.

200
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,953
Yeah, don't worry we'll have safe sex,

201
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:43,322
go get me a Hefty Bag.

202
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,523
(audience laughs)

203
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:46,592
Yeah, I'll hit your G-spot,

204
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:50,229
H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P-spot,

205
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,565
I'll cover the whole damn alphabet, baby.

206
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,234
Come on up here and free Willy, get your ass up here.

207
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,203
Yeah, you don't look too well,

208
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,938
you need a shot of penis-cillin,

209
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,274
that's what you need, baby, yeah.

210
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,143
Don't you worry, yeah, I'm only two inches.

211
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,145
Yeah, from the ground!

212
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,380
(audience laughs)

213
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,582
Yeah, you believe in fairy tales?

214
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,418
Well, Puff the Magic Dragon, baby.

215
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,954
(audience laughs)

216
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:15,788
Ew!

217
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,224
I am sorry.

218
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,259
Puffy's gone now.

219
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,260
Erase, erase, erase.

220
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,964
(audience laughs)

221
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,603
Man, there's some people staring at me right now.

222
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:31,938
(audience laughs)

223
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,340
What the hell just happened to him?

224
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,242
Who's this Lovemaster, looks like John Boy

225
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,843
if you ask me. (Craig chuckles)

226
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:40,646
People tell me I look like John Boy all the time.

227
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,181
(audience laughs)

228
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,851
(audience cheers and claps)

229
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,423
"Hey, he does with the mole on!"

230
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:55,294
Yeah, you don't want John Boy, do you, baby?

231
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,797
Yeah, you're looking at Walton's Mountain,

232
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,065
that's what you-

233
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,132
(audience laughs)

234
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:03,169
Yeah, let's play connect the dot.

235
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,104
Sorry. (Craig chuckles)

236
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,205
Erase, erase.

237
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:10,409
(audience laughs)

238
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,610
Who's this right here, who's this?

239
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,112
Marsha Clark.

240
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,948
(audience laughs)

241
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,752
I checked that trial out, she's sexy, isn't she?

242
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,053
She's got those skirts on, I was,

243
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:26,058
yeah, I got your side bar right here, baby.

244
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:28,327
Yeah, come on, Marsha let me introduce you

245
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:29,462
to Johnnie Cochran.

246
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,565
(audience laughs)

247
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,233
Yeah, come on, baby.

248
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,235
Yeah.

249
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,440
I've got a hung jury waiting for you right here, baby, yeah.

250
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,177
Keep that big mouth open, I'll give you the gag order, baby.

251
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,216
Yeah, come on, Marsha, say O.J.

252
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,754
Yeah, you won't make it to the J, baby.

253
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,355
(audience laughs)

254
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,323
(Craig chuckles)

255
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,391
(raises voice pitch) I'm sorry.

256
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,191
Double erase.

257
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,895
(audience laughs)

258
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,163
Yeah, no.

259
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,401
I have no clue who I am anymore.

260
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,569
My therapist charges me a group rate.

261
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,405
(audience laughs)

262
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,606
I've been in therapy for a long time.

263
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:14,807
They always go back in your history

264
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:15,908
and they find out when it all went wrong.

265
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,710
- When did it all go wrong?

266
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,811
- It's when my mother belly danced

267
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,579
at high school graduation party.

268
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:22,548
- You're kidding.

269
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:23,749
- I swear.

270
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,551
She bought us a keg, she comes down the steps

271
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:27,219
with finger cymbals and bells.

272
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:32,291
- I've got a little treat for you and your friends.

273
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,260
- My friends are on the keg going, "Whew!"

274
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,930
"I'm fucked up and your old lady looks good!"

275
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,432
(audience laughs)

276
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,566
That's a true story.

277
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,235
I love my mother,

278
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,537
my mother raised us all by herself,

279
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,805
I'm proud of her for that, single mother.

280
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,406
Anyone else raised by a single mother?

281
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:48,708
(audience cheers) A few people, all right.

282
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,909
(audience claps)

283
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,210
I'm proud of my mother, that's right.

284
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,878
She had it tough, she had to play both roles,

285
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,146
you know, she'd come home from work,

286
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,181
"Wait 'til your father gets home."

287
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,449
(deepens voice) "I'm here."

288
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,683
(audience laughs)

289
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:58,884
I had no idea who's gonna greet me everyday.

290
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,220
It's like wash the dishes, pull my finger.

291
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,788
(audience laughs)

292
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,223
50/50 shot.

293
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,925
(audience laughs)

294
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,426
My mom was cool

295
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:08,427
and my mom did everything a dad would have done, you know?

296
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:09,829
Taught me how to play ball,

297
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,230
ended up throwing like this.

298
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:15,234
(audience laughs)

299
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,803
I was 19 till I figured out I'm right-handed.

300
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,505
(audience laughs)

301
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,041
My mother gave me my driving instructions too, that's right.

302
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,943
I can't drive worth a shit.

303
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,545
But I can change all my clothes at a stoplight.

304
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,515
(audience laughs)

305
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:32,184
Yeah, and I'm, that's right.

306
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,352
And I'm not afraid to cry

307
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:36,021
to get out of a traffic ticket either.

308
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:39,325
A cop pulls me over. (Craig cries)

309
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,526
Please don't give me a ticket,

310
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,795
I'm having a bad week, I'm bloating.

311
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,965
(audience laughs)

312
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:49,468
Hand-me-downs are a pain the ass in an all female household.

313
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:50,302
(mother knocks)

314
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,138
- Come on out, honey.

315
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,672
- [Craig] No, no way!

316
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:55,407
- Look, there is nothing wrong with hand-me-downs.

317
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,976
I wore hand-me-downs.

318
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,511
- [Craig] No, they'll kill me.

319
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,746
- Look, if your father would send me the child support,

320
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,848
I could buy you new things, but Craig,

321
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,517
I am doing the best I can.

322
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,757
(slow music)

323
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:14,927
What's the problem, you look adorable.

324
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,830
(audience laughs)

325
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,599
- Nothing like the first day of school in a halter top.

326
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,702
And they had those pants with the zipper in the back.

327
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:24,537
You know?

328
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,840
I mean, Mommy, which way do I tinkle?

329
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,308
(audience laughs)

330
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,576
(deepens voice) Hey, you just bend it on back there,

331
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,878
that's all you do, baby.

332
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,346
(audience laughs)

333
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,749
Yeah, look like a water fountain right there, yeah.

334
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,219
Come on Mommy, throw me a quarter.

335
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,787
(audience laughs)

336
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:42,821
(Craig chuckles)

337
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,290
(raises voice pitch) Gross.

338
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,891
Erase, erase.

339
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,393
(audience laughs)

340
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,495
Sex talk is different though when Mom gives it to you.

341
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,563
You know, my friends they would hear from their fathers

342
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:51,964
about the bees going

343
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:54,700
around flower to flower pollinating making new flowers.

344
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,835
What I heard from my mother was "All bees-

345
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,404
- Are scum.

346
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,673
(audience laughs)

347
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,374
Don't you laugh at that, baby.

348
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:05,311
Yeah, I'll come sting your ass, baby.

349
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,680
Big old king bee, boom, you're done.

350
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,582
(audience laughs)

351
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,116
Erase. Erase.

352
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,018
Here's something my mom used to tell me when I was a kid.

353
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,520
My mother used to say,

354
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,321
"Well, you're just gonna have to be our little man

355
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,222
of the house."

356
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,022
Man of the house?

357
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,257
I'm six-years-old,

358
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,159
I'm built like Barney Fife from Mayberry.

359
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,494
I'm trying to order my sisters around.

360
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:25,164
All right, all right, all right.

361
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:28,000
(audience cheers)

00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:19,645
Some of the cereal we ate,

544
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,813
Captain Crunch, oh man.

545
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,383
(audience cheers)

546
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,851
I don't know how you ate that,

547
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,786
that was the hardest, sharpest cereal known to children.

548
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,389
They should call it Captain Fiberglass, this crap.

549
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,757
You had to soak it for four hours

550
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,258
before you could eat it safely,

551
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,860
otherwise I'd been injured walking round the neighborhood,

552
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,729
"I just had Captain Crunch this morning."

553
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,499
"That son of a bitch just peeled the roof off of my mouth."

554
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:44,069
"I got Bandaids on my tonsils."

555
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,904
"I think the toy was softer."

556
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,707
"I'm gonna shoot that son of a bitch."

557
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:53,412
Hey, nothing like a sugar buzz when your a kid though right?

558
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,947
Yeah, as adults we have a cappuccino in the morning,

559
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,115
coffees, kids you get the sugar,

560
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,350
I get a big bowl every morning,

561
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,086
big Jethro Bodine bowl, put in front me.

562
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,322
"Beverly Hillbillies," show in the 60s.

(audience laughs)

564
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,525
I filled it up with Cheerios and milk,

565
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,026
5 inches of sugar on top,

566
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,227
I would eat a layer, if I didn't see sugar I'd panic,

567
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:10,796
took a bowl of sugar, more sugar on top.

568
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,165
Layer, by layer, you take it down to the best part.

569
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,633
Oh, remember that?

570
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,902
That glucose quicksand that's sunk to the bottom?

571
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,136
(audience cheers)

572
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:21,306
Oh, that's a sugar high waiting to-

Fried my head for the week.

574
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:25,977
Few bowls of that I'm gone,

575
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:26,912
I'm walking round the neighborhood

576
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,847
like Reverend Jim from "Taxi,"

577
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:33,151
(Craig mimics stuttering)

578
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,086
"I'm cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!"

579
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,788
"Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!"

580
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:40,525
They put so much money

581
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,194
into selling kids sugar when we were kids,

582
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,895
they actually had Pavarotti singing for cereal,

583
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:45,697
remember that commercial?

584
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:49,000

585

Oh stop!

590
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:13,558
Oh sto- Oh I feel the love I really do.

591
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:15,761
Oh, I'm embarrassed.

592
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,162
Oh, group erase.

594
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,607

596
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,809
Now you're like my grandmother,

597
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:31,743
it's my grandmother's favorite part of my act.

598
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,011
She sits there, "I'm telling ya,

599
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:36,982
you should've been a singer, not a comedian."

600
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,951
"I don't like that Lovemaster, that you do."

601
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,888
Oh come on granny.

602
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,289

Yeah, I'm as stiff as your hairspray, baby.

611
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:07,979
Yeah, you've fallen but you can't get up.

612
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:10,315
Ew!

613
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:12,918
That's his grandmother!

part German, part Irish, part American Indian.

629
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,652

My grandmother, I'm not kidding you,

642
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,941
smokes and grows pot.

643
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,676
Now I quit smoking pot, it's kind of strange

644
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,879
when you quit before your grandmother does.

645
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,881

No one respects me the way I am.

654
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:34,533
- Sweetie, hold it up a little higher.

655
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,435
[Nanna] Stand on your tip toes,

That's good.

657
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,641
Now just hold it until Merv is over.

658
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,342

659
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:48,146
- Oh that's nonsense, look at that Tommy Jones.

660
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:49,381
[Nanna] Who's he kidding?

661

He's short as hell, he wears heels like stilts,

662
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:54,352
[Nanna] and he stuffs his drawers with socks.

663
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:58,456
Hey you could be a singer, you've got a beautiful voice.

664
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:00,492
You could be on Merv.

665
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:02,694
- But Nanna, I don't know how to sing.

666
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:05,697
- Sure you do, you're very talented.

667
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:09,467
Come on, one song for your only grandma.

668

[Craig] Nanna, who am I?

671
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:21,246
(Craig sings) - [Grandma] No, no,no.

672
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:26,051
Sing as you, don't be scared.

673
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:27,552

00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,007
Hope none of those guys are here tonight.

725
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,108
(Craig chuckles)

726
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:31,409
"I'll show you flexible, how was that?"

727
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:33,645
(audience laughs)

728
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,513
And they do that posing thing, like that's attractive.

729
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:36,715
Who the hell you gonna meet like that?

730
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,416
"Excuse me, honey."

731
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:41,252
(audience laughs)

732
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:49,661
Oo, I want you vein man.

00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:51,830
(audience laughs)

734
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,997
Can't work out in front of women,

735
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:54,933
ladies you look to good when you work out.

736
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,367
Yeah, you come in in those outfits,

737
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:59,037
you know those skin on sausage pants you all wear?

738
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,738
(audience cheers)

739
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:01,673
Yeah, when you get on those machines,

740
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,108
you look sexy on those machines.

741
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,709
This is the most distracting machine though ladies.

742
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,578
You know the one I'm talking about.

743
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,713
Yeah, don't get on this one anymore in front of me.

744
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:11,316
(audience cheers)

745
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,518
I live in front of this machine.

746
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:16,154
I have season tickets at the lat thing along the way.

747
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,390
I'm over there, "Oh my God!"

748
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,526
(audience laughs)

749
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:22,627
"Talk to me!"

750
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:27,599
This is taking fitness too far.

751
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,067
What do you need these muscles for?

752
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,768
"Honey you can't get that jar cap open?"

753
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:31,603
(pop)

754
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,437
"No problem!"

755
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:34,939
(audience laughs and cheers)

756
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,241
"I've got my new muscles."

757
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,343
(audience cheers)

758
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,178
"I can change that spare tire."

759
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,620
Tell you what ladies,

760
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,356
I found out the hard way what you need those muscles for.

761
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,124
Yeah, you don't want the guy going down there,

762
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,893
you put the clamp vice on his head.

763
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,794
(audience cheers)

764
00:29:56,794 --> 00:29:58,129
Right, guys?

765
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:01,099
I'm down there, "Okay, you can let go now."

766
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,903
"Please, I can't hear the stereo anymore."

767
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,137
(audience laughs)

768
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,939
"Come on, we'll just kiss, I swear to God."

769
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,876
"You'll crack my head like a fucking walnut, please."

770
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:13,077
(audience laughs)

771
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,245
"Come on, if I was coal you'd make a diamond

772
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,547
out of me, stop it."

773
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,051
That's a true story.

774
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:24,289
My head just came back to normal this week.

775
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,557
Last week, I'm walking around,

776
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,091
"Just trying to give her some pleasure."

777
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,894
(audience laughs)

778
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:31,095
This is my favorite,

779
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:32,263
when you get on this machine, right?

780
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:34,098
Oh yeah.

781
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,969
I'm the stair master baby.

782
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:41,039
I'm the master and I'm staring.

783
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,410
- [Therapist] Craig, this is not a club

784
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,278
and I am not your fan.

785
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,347
Frankly, the Lovemaster frightens me.

786
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:52,350
- [Therapist] He's at the root of your problems Craig.

787
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,787
And I wanna know exactly where this guy is coming from.

788
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,957
- Yeah, from way down under baby.

789
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:00,291
- Are you through?

790
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,026
- Oh, sorry.

791
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,261
Erase, erase, erase, erase.

792
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:04,095
- Stop it!

793
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:08,600
- I wanna know when and where the Lovemaster began.

794
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:13,037
- It was 1990, I was watching television

795
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,406
with an old friend of mine, Debbie Mebbit.

796
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:16,975
[Craig] We'd known each other since high school,

797
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:19,043
but we'd always been buddies,

798
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,913
and I wanted more than that, you know.

799
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:24,515
[Craig] Geeze, look at the body on him.

800
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,552
Deb.

801
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,187
Who do you thinks hotter,

802
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,722
the "Solar Flex" guy or the "Easy Glide" guy?

803
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:34,692
- Oh the "Easy Glide" guy, his ass should be bronze.

804
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:36,261
- He didn't get that ass on "Easy Glide,"

805
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:37,795
believe me, he's a model.

806
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:40,999
- I don't care how he got it, I just know I like it.

807
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:46,404
- Hey, Deb.

808
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,774
What about me?

809
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:50,608
- What about you?

810
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,745
- Ever think about my ass?

811
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,746
(Debbie laughs)

812
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,281
- What are you saying, Shoe?

813
00:31:58,216 --> 00:31:59,284
- What, what, what do you-

814
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,152
what do you think of my ass?

815
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:02,954
- I don't know, it's okay.

816
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:04,889
- You wanna see it?

817
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,492
- Would you stop.

818
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:12,297
- Oh Deb, haven't you ever wondered,

819
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:15,066
you know, what it would be like if,

820
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:16,834
you know,

821
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:19,070
you and me?

822
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:19,904
- No.

823
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:21,539
No, a- absolutely not.

824
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,775
- Loser table for one, loser table for one.

825
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:24,742
(audience laughs)

826
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:25,843
- Oh come on, Deb.

827
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,345
Let's just do it alright?

828
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,113
You and me right here, right now.

829
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,049
Lets ride the rodeo, shake the sheets,

830
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,318
take a ride on the Matterhorn.

831
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:35,887
I want you, you want me, lets just get it over with.

832
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:37,455
- What makes you think I want you?

833
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,124
- Oh, well the way your sucking on that water bottle,

834
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,826
you're checking out "Easy Glide's" ass.

835
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:44,329
- You started it with the, with the "Solar Flex" guy.

836
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:45,730
- Lets just do it.

837
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,231
- No.

838
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:48,066
We can't.

839
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:49,901
- Why not?

840
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:51,769
- Shoe,

841
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:54,672
I'm gay.

842
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,277
- You're a lesbo?

843
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,846
- Yep, yeah, yeah, that's right,

844
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:04,482
I'm, I'm a lesbo.

845
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:07,785
A vagitarian,

846
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:09,687
a lesbian,

847
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:10,521
a dyke.

848
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:14,325
A canyon yodeling, friend of Martinez.

849
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,228
- Wow, you're a lesbian.

850
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,864
All these years I had no idea.

851
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:23,601
- Well, well it's true so, there you have it.

852
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,603
You and I can't have sex.

853
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:29,107
- What about Donya?

854
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:30,608
- What about Donya?

855
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:32,744
- What about you and Donya getting it on while I watch?

856
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,078
- You're sick.

857
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:35,847
- I'm gonna call her.

858
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,315
- No, no!

859
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:38,816
- Why not?

860
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,051
- I-

861
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:43,388
I'm telling you, she's not my type.

862
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,858
I need a, I need a, I need a big,

863
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:50,361
big, earthy, Helga type girl, you know,

864
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:54,232
with, with hair on her back, and combat boots.

865
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:58,469
- What about Nina? Nina flips both ways.

866
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,004
- Big Nina from high school?

867
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:02,073
- Yeah, she was the shot putter on the men's team.

868
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,308
Jesus how big do you want?

869
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:05,243
What is her number?

870
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:06,477
- No, Shoe stop!

871
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:10,748
I'm not gay.

872
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:13,518
- You're not?

873
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:15,453
- No.

874
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,790
I was hoping it would turn you off.

875
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:23,428
- Why would you wanna do that?

876
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:24,362
- Oh, Shoe.

877
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:29,200
You're my buddy, my pal.

878
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,802
You're my friend I watch old movies

879
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,303
with when I don't have a date.

880
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,239
I can't have sex with you.

881
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:37,442
- You can't?

882
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,677
- You're too nice.

883
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:44,682
I need someone who's, a little more mysterious,

884
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:49,887
who's got a little bit of a edge to him,

885
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,889
little bit of nastiness.

886
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:54,926
- You mean an asshole?

887
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,862
- Exactly, that is the type of guy I go for.

888
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:01,833
- I'm mysterious.

889
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,069
I'm definitely mysterious.

890
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:07,371
I'm edgy.

891
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,375
And I'm hot.

892
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,211
I'm a sexy guy.

893
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,479
Yeah!

894
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,047
Walk edgy for the sexy guy.

895
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:20,518
Yeah, I do mysterious, mystery man.

896
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:22,587
Shake it mama for the mystery guy.

897
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:25,323
Mystery man, sex guy.

898
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,291
Master of sex.

899
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:31,028
Come on, give me a little, walking nasty for me.

The love guy.

I was like, "Come on baby dance with the Lovemaster."

948

1084
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,460
She came out of that bathroom,

1085
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,461
I ran in there.

1086
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:47,031
(Craig sniffs)

1087
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:49,667
She's gone on the lawn.

1088
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,136
(audience laughs)

1089
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:54,004
I don't understand it ladies.

1090
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:55,673
We eat the same things you do.

1091
00:42:56,573 --> 00:42:58,075
And where does your gas go?

1092
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,645
And how comes when it comes out of you it's called a fluffy?

1093
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:02,846
(audience laughs)

1094
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:05,015
No man ever let go of a fluffy.

1095
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:08,252
(audience laughs)

1096
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,322
Do you believe all my years I've never heard a female fart?

1097
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:12,222
(audience laughs)

1098
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:13,023
You know why?

1099
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,958
My theory is-

1100
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:15,559
where the hell you going?

1101
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:16,393
(audience cheers)

1102
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:17,227
Yeah.

1103
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:21,231
Lemme open that for you, baby.

1104
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:24,034
You like the way I parted your hair tonight there, baby?

1105
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:27,071
(audience laughs)

1106
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:28,806
(audience cheers)

1107
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:30,140
Sorry, erase, erase, erase.

1108
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:34,311
How come women have to have a possy piss when they go?

1109
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:36,714
They couldn't just go by themself.

1110
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,215
What do you do, hold hands under the stall

1111
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:40,551
and sing "Kumbaya", what the hell goes on in that bathroom?

1112
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,321
♪ Kumbaya my lord, kumbaya.

1113
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:45,689
"Nice shoes."

1114
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:47,858
(audience laughs)

1115
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:48,759
You never see guys going together,

1116
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,260
you ever see a guy go,

1117
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,495
"Yo Ralph, I could take a dump, will you join me?"

1118
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:52,529
"Come on now wipe my ass for me."

1119
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:55,366
(audience laughs)

1120
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:00,537
Never heard a female fart.

1121
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:03,273
My theory is, women hold their gas for five years.

1122
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:04,208
(audience laughs)

1123
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:05,242
Right? Am I right about that?

1124
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:06,410
'Til they really know the guy,

1125
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,578
finally the guy comes home from work,

1126
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:09,613
there's a mushroom cloud around the house.

1127
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:10,848
(audience laughs)

1128
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:12,216
"Hey look Al, she finally let go."

1129
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:14,184
"Must be our five year anniversary."

1130
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:15,686
(audience laughs)

1131
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:18,022
See guys aren't that way, we hold it in for 3 months.

1132
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,656
First 3 months are painful though, right guys?

1133
00:44:19,656 --> 00:44:20,858
You'll be driving along, you're trying to hold it in,

1134
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:23,093
and your butt cheeks are scrunched together,

1135
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:25,863
your sphincter flicking like a bunny's nose.

1136
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:28,832
You could hold a dime for an hour in there.

1137
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,135
Sitting there, "Oh my God, I'm gonna explode."

1138
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:33,270
"Can't wait 'til three months is up,

1139
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:34,838
she'll hear from me."

1140
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,306
(audience laughs)

1141
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:37,775
"Excuse me I gotta get out and check the tire right now,

1142
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:39,443
there's something wrong with the tire."

1143
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:41,845
"Oh yeah, there's a leak all right, I got it."

1144
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,981
(audience laughs)

1145
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,249
You get back in the car

1146
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:46,717
and it follows you in every time doesn't it?

1147
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:48,919
You think the door will cut it off,

1148
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:50,154
it just seals it right in.

1149
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:52,089
(audience laughs)

1150
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,624
You're sitting there, "Oh boy (laughs),

1151
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:56,427
that's catalytic converter acting up again."

1152
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:57,661
(audience laughs)

1153
00:44:57,661 --> 00:45:00,097
"Ah, these damn new cars" (chuckles).

1154
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:02,766
It's like a '72 Dart you're driving.

1155
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:03,667
(audience laughs)

1156
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:05,102
It's a car in the 70s.

1157
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:07,871
(audience laughs)

1158
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,473
Ah here, they come back again.

1159
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:10,974
(audience cheers)

1160
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:12,843
Come on in, come on in, we were talking about you.

1161
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:14,078
(audience laughs)

1162
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:15,079
Could you hear us, could you hear us in there?

1163
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:16,847
Oh, we could hear you.

1164
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:18,382
(audience laughs)

1165
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:22,886
Yeah, you look a little uncomfortable baby.

1166
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,154
I got a fold out couch

1167
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:27,391
and two pillows waiting for you up there, baby.

1168
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,159
Yeah.

1169
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,295
Sorry, erase, erase.

1170
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:33,864
Where's your partner?

1171
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:35,099
- [Audience Member] She's still in there.

1172
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,400
- She still Kumbayaing with somebody else?

1173
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,236
(audience laughs)

1174
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:42,372
See if guys go together,

1175
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:43,907
we used to go together when we were younger.

1176
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,243
We had sword fights with the wee wee, remember that guys?

1177
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,444
I still do it.

1178
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:49,613
I'm Darth Vader in my block.

1179
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:51,348
(mimics Darth Vader's breathing)

1180
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,083
Skywalker I've been waiting for you.

1181
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:56,754
(mimics light saber sounds)

1182
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:01,625
Chop Yoda's little head off.

1183
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:02,893
(audience laughs)

1184
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:06,296
Oh I see the force is strong in you.

1185
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:08,966
Must have drunk a lot of beer.

1186
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:10,767
Do females ever do that, you ever have sword fights?

1187
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:11,935
You ever do that?

1188
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:12,769
(audience laughs)

1189
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:14,104
Come on, touche.

1190
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:16,273
(audience cheers)

1191
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,908
My whole life has been females.

1192
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,344
(audience cheers)

1193
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:21,278
I grew up with them,

1194
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,880
and all this female influence

1195
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,214
has been very good for me, though.

1196
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:26,884
I'm the only guy I know who can fake an orgasm.

1197
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:28,886
(audience laughs) (audience cheers)

1198
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:30,154
Yeah.

1199
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:31,622
Hey, applaud if you've heard this one before.

1200
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,823
If females live together,

1201
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:34,892
eventually their cycles will coincide.

1202
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:36,026
Have you heard that before?

1203
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:36,960
(audience cheers)

1204
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,295
Uh, huh, you've all heard that.

1205
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,129
It's true.

1206
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:41,465
It happened to me.

1207
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,100
(audience laughs)

1208
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,468
[Craig] I never knew when,

1209
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,836
I'd be playing basketball with my friends,

1210
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:48,138
all of a sudden I get emotional for no reason.

1211
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:55,679
(yelling over each other) (ball bouncing)

1212
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:03,153
- [Man who fell] Foul!

1213
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,122
- Foul? I didn't touch you!

1214
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:06,423
- What are you kidding Shoe?

1215
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:07,658
You just hacked the shit out of me.

1216
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,259
- Oh go ahead, make a big deal out of it,

1217
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:10,794
when you foul me I don't say a word,

1218
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:12,262
but it's always about you isn't it?

1219
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:13,697
You selfish bastard!

1220
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:16,667
You have no regard for my feelings, my needs.

1221
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,735
- What the hell's wrong with him?

1222
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:20,037
- It's that time of the month.

1223
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:22,506
- Hey Shoe, you okay man?

1224
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,707
- Look, I'm sorry guys.

1225
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:25,709
I've been feeling a little edgy,

1226
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:27,911
and a little overwhelmed,

1227
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:30,514
like, like, nobody really understands.

1228
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,383
Look, let's not fight, just hold me.

1229
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:36,386
- Maybe you've been overworking yourself, Shoe.

1230
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:38,722
You need to take some time off, man.

1231
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:42,059
- Don't try to fix my feelings, just listen.

1232
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:43,894
- Alright, alright.

1233
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:47,164
No foul you guys, it's Shoe's ball, okay?

1234
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:48,065
- [Player] Yeah, alright.

1235
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:49,499
- Shoe's ball.

1236
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:51,235
Come on man, it's alright, come on.

1237
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:53,670
(chattering)

1238
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,506
- Oh go ahead, fine, fine, I'll go get the ball.

1239
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:58,408
(chattering)

1240
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:00,510
Guys, where are you going?

1241
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:01,645
Are we playing or what?

1242
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:04,481
(audience cheers)

1243
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:05,849

Ah huh, y'all read those damn books,

1248
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:13,023
whatever that shit is.

1249
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:15,025

Fix my feelings?

1252
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:18,962
We don't know what to say anymore.

1253
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:20,264
She'll be over there, "Oh God,

1254
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:22,165
you know I can't find a job."

1255
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:23,834
Well apply for one.

1256
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:26,203
(audience laughs)

1257
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:27,771
Did I say the wrong thing?

1258
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:30,908
(audience cheers)

1259
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:33,210
Anybody married here? Anybody married?

1260
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,711
(audience cheers) Few people married, yeah.

1261
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,213
Cool.

1262
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:37,247
You have to get used to stuff though,

1263
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,482
when you get married,

1264
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:40,550
like if they have pets, my wife had two dogs,

1265
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,486
and they became my step-dogs.

1266
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:43,954
(audience laughs)

1267
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:44,888
No choice in the matter, one of them's a Dachschund,

1268
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:46,456
you know what a Dachschund is?

1269
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:48,125
A wiener dog.

1270
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:50,861
I look real macho walking a wiener dog.

1271
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,129
And she'll feed it too much,

1272
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:54,231
it's now a kielbasa I'm walking down the street.

1273
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:55,365
(audience laughs)

1274
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:56,633
Got this big gut dragging on the ground,

1275
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:58,535
"Hey get me off the cement this hurts."

1276
00:48:58,535 --> 00:48:59,870
(audience laughs)

1277
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:02,372
"Put me on the grass, that tickles my belly."

1278
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:04,541
"Look out for that speed bump!"

1279
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:08,078
(audience laughs)

1280
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:09,880
It got stuck on a speed bump.

1281
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,182
Big, fat sausage.

1282
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:14,952
And she's got this other dog,

1283
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,120
it's half Pitbull, half Poodle.

1284
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,123
Not much of a guard dog, but a vicious gossip.

1285
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:23,193
(audience laughs)

1286
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:24,895
After we were married a little while,

1287
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:27,097
after the LA earthquake, there were a lot of stray dogs.

1288
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:28,899
We got another dog, a stray dog, after the earthquake.

1289
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:30,367
They're crazy from the earthquake.

1290
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,069
This one follows my wife home, doesn't bark anymore,

1291
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:34,037
it just goes (wheezily exhales).

1292
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:35,539
(audience laughs)

1293
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:37,040
(wheezily barks)

1294
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:37,974
I said, "What the hell?"

1295
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:39,543
Kick up a fur ball or something.

1296
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:40,811
(audience laughs) (wheezes)

1297
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,045
I said to my wife,

1298
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:42,979
"What the hell do we need another dog for?

1299
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:44,414
She says, "We need a watchdog."

1300
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:45,982
'Cause all it's gonna do is watch.

1301
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:46,817
(audience laughs)

1302
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:47,651
Who's it gonna scare?

1303
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:48,485
Hey, go get them!

1304
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,220
(Wheezes)

1305
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,156
Need an interpreter, "Hey get out of here burglar."

1306
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,358
(audience laughs)

1307
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:56,293
"We don't want you in here."

1308
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:57,995
(audience laughs)

1309
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,262
I've got the real solution though.

1310
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:00,964
You install one of those mechanical voice boxes.

1311
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:03,400
She wants to bark, she'll put her paw on the button.

1312
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,104
(makes muffled barking sound)

1313
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:10,941
(makes muffled barking sound)

1314
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:13,377
That'll scare a robber off.

1315
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,513
Imagine you're breaking into a house,

1316
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,481
here comes a three-legged dog,

1317
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:18,849
holding onto a button.

1318
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,684
(muffled barking sound)

1319
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,252
(audience laughs)

1320
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:25,288
(audience applauds)

1321
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:27,691
[Craig] It's robo dog.

1322
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,927
(audience cheers)

1323
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:32,129
My wife is always mad at me.

1324
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:33,630
You can tell when somebody's mad at you.

1325
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,999
A female is mad at you, they have a noise they do.

1326
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:37,300
Only females can do this noise,

1327
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,369
I'll try to duplicate it for you.

1328
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,904
(Craig tuts)

1329
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:42,339
(audience laughs)

1330
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:43,306
(Craig tuts)

1331
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:44,574
She can do this thing so loud,

1332
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:45,742
locusts would show up on our driveway.

1333
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:47,711
(audience laughs)

1334
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,013
(footsteps)

1335
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:55,986
- Hi, sweetie.

1336
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:05,495
- Think you'll be done with your writing soon?

1337
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:07,431
You said we could go to the movies, right?

1338
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:09,800
- Just a few more minutes.

1339
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,568
[Craig] It's going a little slower than I thought.

1340
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:13,970
(wife tuts)

1341
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:15,172
- When she was real mad she'd follow with the f-word.

1342
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:16,740
Yeah, the female f-word.

1343
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,108
"Fine."

1344
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:19,176
(audience laughs)

1345
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:20,877
- Well we missed "Dawn of Love,"

1346
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:24,347
but if we hurry we can catch "Time Orado", starts at 1:30.

1347
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:26,516
- Time Orado? What the hell is that?

1348
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:27,751
- Oh it's supposed to be excellent,

1349
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,586
Gene Siskel gives it a thumbs up.

1350
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:32,422
- Gene Siskel, oh gee, there's some incentive.

1351
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:33,657
- I thought you liked Siskel.

1352
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:35,592
- That's Schickel honey, Richard Schickle,

1353
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:36,893
What does Siskel know?

1354
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:38,628
You put subtitles on Rambo,

1355
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:41,264
he'll call it the greatest foreign film of time.

1356
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:44,100
- Well why don't we just not go to the movies then, fine.

1357
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:49,005
- Guys, if you hear fine, you are fucked.

1358
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:50,474
(audience laughs)

1359
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:52,075
(audience cheers)

1360
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:53,643
You've got no shot at survival.

1361
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:57,647
- You always do this, you know that?

1362
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:58,882
- Do what?

1363
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:00,183
- Start an argument over the stupidest things

1364
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:01,818
to get out of the plans we made.

1365
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:02,853
- What argument?

1366
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:04,087
- Gene Shallot?

1367
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:05,088
- Gene Siskel.

1368
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:06,590
- What?

1369
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:07,991
- We were arguing over Gene Siskel, not Gene Shallot.

1370
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:10,861
- So you admit you did start an argument?

1371
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:12,529
- Huh.

1372
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:14,464
- Then they have one more word,

1373
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,900
you hear this one, you're in the biggest trouble of all.

1374
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:17,901
"Whatever."

1375
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:20,737
(audience laughs)

1376
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:28,311
- All I wanted to do was go to the movies with my husband,

1377
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:31,882
and you attack me with this Gene Shallot shit.

1378
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:35,218
- I did not attack you, and it was Gene Shiskle.

1379
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:36,419
- Siskel.

1380
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:38,822
- Siskel, Shiskle, you know what I meant.

1381
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,023
- You Dick Shickel.

1382
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:41,458
- Shickle?

1383
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:44,127
I said Shiskle but meant Siskle because you said Shallot.

1384
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:46,563
- Then you said Shickel, after you started it with Siskle.

1385
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:48,265
- And you thought Shallot.

1386
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:49,699
- I never said Shallot.

1387
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:51,902
- I'm telling you, you thought Siskle was Shallot.

1388
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:54,004
- I would never confuse Shallot with Siskle,

1389
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,739
it's Shickle, you're confused with Shiskle.

1390
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:56,907
- Siskel.

1391
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:58,475
- See it was Siskle.

1392
00:52:58,475 --> 00:52:59,943
- No, you just said Shiskle, you meant Siskle,

1393
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:01,478
but you said Shiskle.

1394
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:03,914
- I would never say Shiskle, because there is no Shiskle,

1395
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,248
that's your invention.

1396
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:07,350
There is only Shickel, Shallot and Siskel.

1397
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:10,120
- What about Joe Siegel?

1398
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,255
- Siegel? What's he got to do with it?

1399
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:13,156
Stick to the issue.

1400
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:14,090
- What issue?

1401
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:15,358
- Shickel, Shallot and Siskel.

1402
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,192
- And Siegel.

1403
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:17,260
- There is no Siegel.

1404
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,228
- He's on NBC.

1405
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:19,429
- ABC.

1406
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:20,297
- So you admit there is a Siegel.

1407
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:21,131
- But not here.

1408
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:21,965
- Where?

1409
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:22,799
- In this argument.

1410
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:23,767
- I'm not arguing.

1411
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:26,903
- Fine.

1412
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:30,106
Whatever.

1413
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:33,043
(audience laughs)

1414
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,211
- Evacuate, don't even pack a bag, you're done.

1415
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:37,080
(audience laughs)

1416
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,748
- [Audience Member] Yeah!

1417
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:40,750
(audience laughs)

1418
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,152
- You know what it is?

1419
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:43,753
It's the Peter Pan thing, men are Peter Pan.

1420
00:53:43,753 --> 00:53:46,122
That's what, all the women write those books too.

1421
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:48,158
Men are immature, I'm proud of being immature.

1422
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:50,160
Anybody else proud of being immature?

1423
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:50,994
(audience cheers)

1424
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:51,828
Right on.

1425
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:55,532
I wanna be a little kid when I grow up.

1426
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:56,933
To this day, I go to the ball park,

1427
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:58,768
I, I wear my glove on every pitch,

1428
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:00,070
amusement parks, go on every ride,

1429
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,005
favorite ride to this day is the bumper cars.

1430
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:03,940
Yeah, you ever get in a bumper car ride as an adult,

1431
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,176
you pick out a little kid and you pin them in a corner.

1432
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:07,611
(audience laughs)

1433
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:08,745
Come over here.

1434
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:13,783
Come on get your little ass over here.

1435
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:16,586
(imitates child voice) "Get away from me!"

1436
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,821
(audience laughs)

1437
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:19,522
(microphone hitting wall)

1438
00:54:19,522 --> 00:54:20,357
"Get off of me mister!"

1439
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:23,393
"Come on, the ride's over."

1440
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:26,262
"You're a jerk."

1441
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:29,232
That's a lot of fun.

1442
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:32,602
Here's a ride I went on.

1443
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:35,305
I went on a ride one time, never forget this ride.

1444
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:36,806
17 years old, me and my buddies,

1445
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:39,276
drunk as skunks, got on a ride called the "Hell Hole."

1446
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:40,543
You might know it as "The Roader."

1447
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:41,745
And all it is, is a cylinder, right,

1448
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,046
you stand inside the cylinder, right?

1449
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:44,681
It starts spinning really fast,

1450
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:46,516
900 miles and hour, the floor drops off.

1451
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:48,418
We stay on the wall like dead guppies.

1452
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:52,188
And this is all you do, the entire ride.

1453
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:54,524
(audience laughs)

1454
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:55,659
"This is a lot of fun."

1455
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:57,694
(audience laughs)

1456
00:54:57,694 --> 00:54:58,528
"Woo!"

1457
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:02,799
"Hey, I wonder what George is doing over-"

1458
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:07,470
(audience laughs)

1459
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:08,305
"Here!"

1460
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,075
"He puked!"

1461
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:17,047
"It's stuck to the side."

1462
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:18,381
(audience laughs)

1463
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:20,483
"It's coming towards me."

1464
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:23,353
"I can't move."

1465
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:24,287
(audience laughs)

1466
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:25,488
"Stop this thing, please."

1467
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,058
"I'll pay."

1468
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:29,459
(audience laughs)

1469
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:31,494
I'll never forget we all got on this thing.

1470
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,530
It starts spinning, my fat friend Stiney,

1471
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:35,532
he's too heavy for centripetal force.

1472
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,668
The floor drops, he goes down with it.

1473
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:39,936
(audience laughs)

1474
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:41,237
I'll never forget his face over there,

1475
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:43,306
"Whoa, whoa what's going on?"

1476
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:44,741
(audience laughs)

1477
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:46,543
"It's not working for me!"

1478
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:48,912
(audience laughs)

1479
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:50,413
He's down here, we're up there,

1480
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:53,183
it's spinning around, his tits are pinned to the wall.

1481
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,985
(audience laughs)

1482
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:59,122
(audience cheers)

1483
00:55:59,122 --> 00:55:59,989
True story.

1484
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,562
Stiney had great tits, I'll tell you that right now.

1485
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:07,063
(audience cheers)

1486
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:07,864
8th grade, those were the first tits I ever felt,

1487
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,099
to tell you the truth.

1488
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:10,066
(audience laughs)

1489
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:11,267

1490
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:12,836

1492
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:16,506
- Oh come on, just one.

1493
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:18,241

1494
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:20,343

1495
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:22,812
- No, stay away you pervert!

1496
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:25,648
- Oh come on Stiney, if I was fat I'd let you feel mine.

1497
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,219
- I think I'm sharing too much with you people.

1498
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,320
(audience laughs)

1499
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,554

You know what it is ladies?

It's because you're here.

1510
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,504
That's right, guys keep secrets from you their entire lives.

1511
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:50,073
We have guy's secrets, and that's one of them.

00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,941
You know, yeah well you know what one of them-

Oh no, we're not keeping it that way.

00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:55,945
I'm telling you, I'm letting the ladies

00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:11,461
every guy in the room has done this.

1527
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:12,896
At some point in their lives,

1528
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:15,064
they have been naked in front of a full length mirror,

1529
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:17,567
took their jewels, tucked them back by their ass,

1530
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:19,736
tucked their legs in,

1531
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:21,538
to see what they would look like as a woman.

1532
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:23,606

(audience cheers)

1538
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:34,651
"What's that back there?"

1539
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,219
"A bowl of fruit."

1540
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:37,320
(audience cheers)

1541
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,389
"Oh walk nasty, Chiquita."

1542
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:41,124
(audience cheers)

1543
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,358

Hands up on that one.

(audience laughs)

1548
00:57:47,463 --> 00:57:48,698
You did it, right here?

00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:50,700
Get the fuck out of here!

1550
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:51,768
(audience cheers)

1551
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:53,837
A man!

1552
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:55,672
That's a real man, that's an honest man.

1553
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:57,674
Give me some skin on that brother.

1554
00:57:57,674 --> 00:57:58,808
Yeah!

1555
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:01,411
That's a man, that's a real man.

1556
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:05,081
Can't believe you'd admit it in front of all these people.

1557
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:06,015
(audience laughs)

1558
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:07,250
I never went through it myself,

1559
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,418
I think it's great that you'd admit it.

1560
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:10,186
I saw it on "Silence of the Lambs."

1561
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:13,690
(audience laughs)

1562
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:15,725

(audience laughs)

1564
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:19,529
You're looking at your fucking watch?

1565
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:20,363
(audience laughs)

1566
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:21,731
You did it tonight?

1567
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:23,032
What the hell, is she shaking her head?

1568
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:23,933
He did it for you?

1569
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:27,237
How did that come up?

1570
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:29,038
"Hey honey, got a little surprise for you."

1571
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:30,573
Turn around, your thinking, "ring, roses."

1572

the whole place is trying to look at you right now.

1579

00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:49,959
You'll be a celebrity walking out of here, man.

"Do it now! Do vagina man!"

1587
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:00,970
"That's the last time I'm ever doing this,

1588
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:02,538
I'm sorry I ever admitted it."

1589
00:59:02,538 --> 00:59:04,574
(audience laughs)

1590
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:06,009
That is so cool.

(audience laughs)

1613
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:47,951
"That couldn't hold up a dry Kleenex, put it away."

1614
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:50,553
"Here's what I learned, erase, erase, erase."

1615
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:53,323
(audience laughs)

1616
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:55,291
(audience cheers)

1617
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:57,560
That's what's gonna happen.

1618
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:01,364
I'm telling you, I'm warning you guys.

1619
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:04,367
Don't try it at home, my wife hated the Lovemaster.

1620
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,803
- [Craig] Oh yeah.

1621
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:09,939
[Craig] I'm feeling frisky, baby.

1622
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,941
- Will you stop it, I'm trying to read.

1623
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:17,180
- Yeah, I got a pop tent for you, baby.

1624
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:20,450
Come and see the circus.

1625
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,019
- Craig, I don't like that Lovemaster.

1626
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:24,587
Save that for your little skit.

1627
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:38,534
- Do Barney Fife.

1628
01:00:39,736 --> 01:00:43,006
- (sniffs) Alright, you asked for it.

1629
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:44,741
Come on take it all mama.

1630
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:49,078
(audience cheers) Take it all mama.

1631
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:50,480
Come on, back up.

1632
01:00:51,647 --> 01:00:53,182
Back up!

1633
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:55,952
Come on, I don't know how big this thing's gonna get.

1634
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:58,855
Look out for that head bar.

1635
01:00:58,855 --> 01:01:00,623
(audience laughs)

1636
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:01,657
(sniffs) Did you cum?

1637
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:05,828
(audience laughs)

1638
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,164
And that's why we're divorced today.

1639
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,332
(audience laughs)

1640
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:10,833
She showed the video tape in court.

1641
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:13,603
In slow motion.

1642
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:16,639
There I was, "Take it all."

1643
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:17,507
(audience laughs)

1644
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:18,341
"Baby!"

1645
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,045
"Back up!"

1646
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:27,316
"Did you cum?"

1647
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:31,087
(audience laughs)

1648
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:33,122
You know what I got outta that divorce.

1649
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:34,090
A fucking bowl.

1650
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:36,659
(audience cheers)

1651
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:37,760
She took the potpourri.

1652
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:43,766
- [Therapist] So what?

1653
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:45,802
So your marriage was a bust?

1654
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:48,905
It doesn't mean you can't ever find true love.

1655
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:50,540
Well, I don't know, doc.

1656
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,309
- Well you're not ever gonna know until you try.

1657
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:56,312
Now I think it's time for you to start dating again.

1658
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:58,714
- Doc, let's face it,

1659
01:01:58,714 --> 01:02:00,817
I don't think I'm destined to find someone.

1660
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:03,186
- One date Craig, one date.

1661
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:07,223
No masks, no Lovemaster, simply relax and be you.

1662
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:14,163
(romantic jazz music)

1663
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:24,040
- [Woman] Tonight was really fun.

1664
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,308
- [Craig] Yeah.

1665
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:28,945
- I didn't know you could dance like that.

1666
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:30,680
- Well I learned it from my mother.

1667
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,348
- Oh, was she a dancer?

1668
01:02:32,348 --> 01:02:33,449
- Yeah.

1669
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:34,650
- Ballet?

1670
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:35,485
- Belly.

1671
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:37,220
- Oh.

1672
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:40,790
(kisses cheek)

1673
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:41,624
- What's wrong?

1674
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:45,061
- Oh, can I be honest with you?

1675
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:45,895
- Sure.

1676
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:50,833
- Okay, Craig, I think you're a really nice guy.

1677
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:55,138
It's just that, nice is not what I'm looking for.

1678
01:02:56,639 --> 01:03:00,243
- I don't understand, what are you looking for?

1679
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:01,043
- Well.

1680
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:03,746
When I saw your show,

1681
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:06,516
I really wanted to meet you.

1682
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:12,421
I, something about you really, turned me on.

1683
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:14,891
- Ha, my sense of humor?

1684
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:16,192
- [Woman] No.

1685
01:03:16,192 --> 01:03:18,027
- Boyish charm?

1686
01:03:18,027 --> 01:03:20,062
- Not exactly.

1687
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:21,864
- My sensitivity towards women?

1688
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:25,001
- The Lovemaster, Craig.

1689
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:27,904
I want the Lovemaster.

1690
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:32,141
- That's just a character from my act.

1691
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,143
That's not really me.

1692
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:38,347
- But you- I mean can you, I just wanna see-

1693
01:03:38,347 --> 01:03:39,982
- Uh, oh.

1694
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:42,185
- Oh come on, the Lovemaster.

1695
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,756
- You really don't want him.

1696
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:50,827
- Oh, then you really don't want me.

1697
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:54,130
Goodnight.

1698
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:00,336
Thanks, anyway.

1699
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:10,346
(doorbell rings)

1700
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:14,217
Yes?

1701
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:18,654
- It wasn't my hand that rang the doorbell, baby.

1702
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:22,725
- Well, come on in.

1703
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:25,595
- Oh, yeah.

1704
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:30,766
- Oh you almost did it, you were so close.

1705
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:34,070
- I just couldn't do it, doc.

1706
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:38,274
She was like a dream, I couldn't pass it up.

1707
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:39,542
I'm not that strong.

1708
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:40,876
- Well you're gonna have to get stronger

1709
01:04:40,876 --> 01:04:43,346
if we're gonna get anywhere at all, okay?

1710
01:04:45,881 --> 01:04:47,817
Where can you go to meet someone?

1711
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:51,320
Where you can feel safe, really free?

1712
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,389
Some place you can just let everything go,

1713
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:54,724
let it all hang out.

1714
01:04:55,825 --> 01:04:58,261
- I went to a nude beach to meet somebody.

1715
01:04:58,261 --> 01:04:59,262
(audience cheers)

1716
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:00,896
Anyone here been to a nude beach?

1717
01:05:00,896 --> 01:05:03,899
- Shoe, look at all them, this is great!

1718
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:06,235
Oh, boy.

1719
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:07,036
Oh, boy, Oh, boy! - Alright Stiney, act cool.

1720
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:08,004
Act cool! Act cool!

1721
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:09,605
Hey, how you doing?

1722
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:12,174
- How you doing, how you doing?

1723
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:15,911
- Shoey, are you kidding me, Shoey!

1724
01:05:15,911 --> 01:05:18,481
Shoe, what are you doing it's a nude beach.

1725
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:20,316
- Come on relax, I'm nude.

1726
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:22,985
- [Stiney] Yeah, you're nude, I'm nude!

1727
01:05:22,985 --> 01:05:25,288
[Stiney] Come on, come on!

1728
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:26,555
- [Craig] Wait up!

1729
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:29,759
[Craig] Come on, slim, wait up!

1730
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,494
- And my peepee's never been in the sun

1731
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:32,762
for that long before.

1732
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:33,929
I'm trying to be inconspicuous

1733
01:05:33,929 --> 01:05:35,131
putting sunblock on my wiener

1734
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:37,066
in the middle of broad daylight.

1735
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:42,271
This isn't bad enough, they make it out of white cream.

1736
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:45,808
(audience cheers)

1737
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:47,143
These people think I'm spanking the monkey

1738
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:48,811
in the middle of the beach out here.

1739
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:50,446
(audience claps)

1740
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:53,282
People look at me, "Is he clearing a snorkel over there?"

1741
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:57,186
It's not the same as doing your back

1742
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:58,120
or handing it to someone like,

1743
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:58,954
"Hey, can you do this for me?"

1744
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:02,625
"Yeah, sure, I'll help you out with that thing, yeah."

1745
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,126
(mumbles)

1746
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:05,828
"Ah yeah, you're all set there."

1747
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:07,129
"Hey, go take a walk!"

1748
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:09,198
Take a walk?

1749
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:10,399
I gotta smoke a cigarette.

1750
01:06:13,502 --> 01:06:14,904
Then I go for my first nude walk,

1751
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:16,706
made a big mistake, went into the cold water.

1752
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:18,741
You know what happens then, right guys?

1753
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:20,209
Shrinkage.

1754
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:21,043
- Shoe!

1755
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:24,313
Shoe!

1756
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:25,348
- [Craig] I don't care who the hell you are,

1757
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:27,516
it's an acorn in that cold water.

1758
01:06:27,516 --> 01:06:28,317
- Shoe!

1759
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:32,688
- This is a true story.

1760
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:34,357
I came out of the water, I made a beeline for the towel.

1761
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:36,092
[Craig] "Hoo, no, they're not gonna see me like this."

1762
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:38,661
Three gorgeous women intercept me.

1763
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:39,995
They recognize me from the show the night before.

1764
01:06:39,995 --> 01:06:41,397
They start talking to me, they're nude.

1765
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:43,566
My weiner looks like button on a fur coat.

1766
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:45,067
- We saw you the other night at the club.

1767
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:46,502
You were great!

1768
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:48,604
I mean jaw is still hurting from laughing so much.

1769
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:49,972
Do it, Tina. Do it.

1770
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:53,275
(mimics Craig's joke)

1771
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:55,211
- [Nude Woman] I thought I was gonna die!

1772
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:56,412
And you know what?

1773
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:57,213
You don't look a thing like John Boy,

1774
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:58,714
you are much sexier.

1775
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:00,683
- [Craig] Oh, thank you.

1776
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:01,884
Whole time they're talking to me,

1777
01:07:01,884 --> 01:07:02,685
I don't hear a word they're saying.

1778
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:03,619
I'm standing there like,

1779
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:04,987
"Please grow, please grow!"

1780
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:06,355
"Make him grow!"

1781
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:07,823
I'm trying to hit it real casually.

1782
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:11,627
"Aw, you like that show, that's good."

1783
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:12,762
"Just great."

1784
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:14,029
"Lemme hear uh..."

1785
01:07:14,029 --> 01:07:15,531
Your-your favorite part of the show.

1786
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:16,999
- Please, the Lovemaster! (girls moan in unison)

1787
01:07:16,999 --> 01:07:19,135
I mean when you're out there just going,

1788
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:22,104
"C'mon baby, talk nasty for the Lovemaster."

1789
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:23,439
I get so excited,

1790
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:25,908
I just wanna jump up on stage and, "Ruff!"

1791
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:26,742
You know?

1792
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:30,513
Look girls, he's doing his act for us right now.

1793
01:07:30,513 --> 01:07:32,014
He's doing vagina man!

1794
01:07:33,816 --> 01:07:36,118
- I'm not doing vagina man, right now!

1795
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:38,287
- You're not?

1796
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:42,458
- Let's get out of here.

1797
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:48,931
(Craig sighs)

1798
01:07:48,931 --> 01:07:51,767

1799
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,571
(audience cheers)

1800
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:05,948
- I was Flipper.

1801
01:08:05,948 --> 01:08:08,751
(dolphin trills)

1802
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:10,786
Dolphin at his own show in the 60s.

1803
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:14,790
I got other impressions.

1804
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:15,991
You guys like impressions?

1805
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:17,193
- [Audience] Yeah!

1806
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:18,561
- I can do some impressions for you.

1807
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:19,895
Alright, here's my impression of the Cowardly Lion

1808
01:08:19,895 --> 01:08:21,831
from the Wizard of OZ on a motorcycle.

1809
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:27,703
(imitates motorcycle engine and the Lion sobbing)

1810
01:08:31,006 --> 01:08:33,409
(audience cheers and claps)

1811
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:36,212
[Craig] I've got another one!

1812
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:37,646
I've got some more!

1813
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:39,715
My whole life, I always wondered what it would be like

1814
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:41,183
to be somebody else.

1815
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:44,286
We're gonna take that back and see what it would be like

1816
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:45,921
to be born as a celebrity.

1817
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:47,857
These are my impressions of the birth of celebrities.

1818
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:48,791
Celebrities that are being born,

1819
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,326
starting with Jack Nicholson.

1820
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:52,661
We'll take you to the hospital room now with Mrs. Nicholson.

1821
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:53,896
Alright, Mrs. Nicholson.

1822
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:54,830
Take it easy now.

1823
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,065
Now breathe deep.

1824
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:56,966
Come on bear down and push Mrs. Nicholson.

1825
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:57,800
Push!

1826
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:02,271
(audience laughs)

1827
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:08,410
(audience cheers and applauds)

1828
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:14,917
Here's Johnny!

1829
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:18,621
Wow, we're on a roll here now.

1830
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:19,555
Here we go.

1831
01:09:19,555 --> 01:09:21,457
From "60 Minutes," Anne Derune.

1832
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:24,326
Did you ever look in the inside of a uterus?

1833
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:27,429
Kinda cramped in here.

1834
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:29,732
Rambo.

1835
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:32,668
(moans repeatedly)

1836
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:38,107
Rocky.

1837
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:40,609
(moans again)

1838
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:44,547
"Cliffhanger."

1839
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:47,383
(repeats moaning)

1840
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:50,419
Hey, I'd like to buy a consonant!

1841
01:09:50,419 --> 01:09:52,187
(audience laughs)

1842
01:09:52,187 --> 01:09:55,291
Hey, you got that one, eh?

1843
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:56,125
More births.

1844
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:57,726
Pee-Wee Herman.

1845
01:09:57,726 --> 01:09:58,928
Okay, miss.

1846
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:00,729
What if I don't feel like coming out?

1847
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:03,499
Ala-la-la-la.

1848
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:07,436
Looks like you're gonna have to come in and get me.

1849
01:10:07,436 --> 01:10:08,737
Mike Tyson.

1850
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:10,239
Excuse me, doc.

1851
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,241
Try to spank me and I'll slap the shit out of you.

1852
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:14,610
(audience laughs)

1853

(speaks indistinctively)

1856
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:27,256
Hey, would you look at this!

1857
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:28,257
I'm outta here!

1858
01:10:28,257 --> 01:10:30,626
(audience laughs)

1859
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:31,627

01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:42,571
And the Lovemaster.

1863
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:44,440
Come here, nursie baby.

1864
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:53,082
It's the umbilical cord you see coming out of there, baby.

1865
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:55,150
Aw, yeah! Birth of celebrities!

1866
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:55,951
Thank you!

I'm glad I came here.

1870
01:11:10,032 --> 01:11:12,067
I live in Los Angeles, you know?

1871
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:13,168
- [Audience Member] Woo!

1872
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:14,403
- Don't boo.

1873
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:16,538
I have to live there for show-biz purposes.

1874
01:11:16,538 --> 01:11:17,906
You think I'm gonna get discovered

1875
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:20,342
in a shopping center in Phoenix?

1876
01:11:20,342 --> 01:11:23,212
(audience laughs)

1877
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:25,214
Everybody in LA is in show-biz.

1878
01:11:25,214 --> 01:11:26,548
Everybody you meet.

1879
01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:27,783
The people in drugstores, grocery store,

1880
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:28,984
waiters, waitresses, they're all frustrated

1881
01:11:28,984 --> 01:11:30,419
screenwriters, directors, actors.

1882
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:31,987
Even the policeman who stops me for drunk driving.

1883
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:33,756
He's a frustrated choreographer.

1884
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:34,690
Instead of me walk the line,

1885
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:36,425
he wants me to follow after him.

1886
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:37,259
"Here we go."

1887
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:38,494
"And, follow me!"

1888
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:39,361
"Step, kick, ball change, step right,

1889
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:40,596
step, step, step,

1890
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:42,831
kick ball change, step, smile pretty!"

1891
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:43,966
"Shuffle!"

1892
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:45,334
(sings)

1893
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:46,302
"Someone missed a step!"

1894
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:47,136
"Bitch, don't get me pissy!"

1895
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,637
"I am in a mood."

1896
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:54,677
[Craig] Yeah.

1897
01:11:57,746 --> 01:11:59,048
You know why I like coming here though?

1898
01:11:59,048 --> 01:12:00,516
It's- everybody's cool around here, you know?

1899
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:01,884
In Los Angeles, the whole show-biz thing is ridiculous.

1900
01:12:01,884 --> 01:12:03,085
You know where it's really bad?

1901
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:04,320
If you go to a ball game out there,

1902
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,921
the people that sing "The National Anthem."

1903
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:07,423
You cannot sing along with them

1904
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,692
because they think it's their big audition piece.

1905
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:11,060
They know producers are in the audience,

1906
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:13,095
they're thinking they're gonna get a record deal

1907
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:14,596
out of "The National Anthem."

1908
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:15,698
This is what it's like if a guy has his big break

1909
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:16,765
in front of Dodger Stadium.

1910
01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:18,167
It goes something like this.

1911
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:21,437
Alright, let's say Lovemaster has his big shot

1912
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:22,871
