00:23:52,163 --> 00:23:56,003
these gentlemen
are not retiring.

375
00:23:56,777 --> 00:23:57,706
Miller,

376
00:23:57,741 --> 00:24:00,071
please meet detectives Perez
and Jones.

377
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:04,746
Detectives Perez and Jones,
meet Miller.

378
00:24:04,781 --> 00:24:06,611
Man, you told me to never
breathe a word.

379
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:07,449
And I didn't.

380
00:24:07,484 --> 00:24:08,380
And I commend you for that.

381
00:24:08,415 --> 00:24:08,919
I do.

382
00:24:08,954 --> 00:24:09,448
I do.

383
00:24:09,483 --> 00:24:10,153
I just...

384
00:24:10,189 --> 00:24:11,120
Just hey, come on.

385
00:24:11,156 --> 00:24:12,448
Hey, hey...

386
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:17,189
I need you to know something.

387
00:24:17,224 --> 00:24:20,831
That if you ever try
and fuck with me in any way,

388
00:24:20,866 --> 00:24:24,999
these gentlemen can and will
make your life miserable.

389
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:32,735
What are you doing?

390
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,680
[Grunting]

391
00:24:40,546 --> 00:24:42,115
[Coughs]

392
00:24:43,288 --> 00:24:45,151
We got something.

393
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,286
Well, well, well Miller.

394
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,924
He's a convicted felon, chief.

395
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,633
He had his locksmithing
certification revoked.

396
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,830
Yeah,

397
00:24:53,865 --> 00:24:55,865
but did you actually see him
use the kit though?

398
00:24:57,136 --> 00:24:58,136
I mean, no sir,

399
00:24:58,165 --> 00:24:59,441
but you got to understand,
is this guy here...

400
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:02,674
Then what the hell is he doing
in my station in cuffs?

401
00:25:05,146 --> 00:25:07,173
Are you out of your mind?

402
00:25:08,213 --> 00:25:09,805
It was zwick.

403
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,183
Oh, come on.

404
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:12,481
Zwick wasn't anyone near this.

405
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:14,053
I was making a run for frank.

406
00:25:14,088 --> 00:25:15,847
It's a locksmith Van.

407
00:25:15,883 --> 00:25:17,148
There's equipment in the back.

408
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:19,417
Then, don't drive around
in a locksmith Van.

409
00:25:19,452 --> 00:25:22,460
They would have pulled me over
if I was on roller blades.

410
00:25:22,496 --> 00:25:23,737
It didn't matter
what I was driving.

411
00:25:23,761 --> 00:25:25,690
Everything matters
at this point, Miller.

412
00:25:25,726 --> 00:25:27,122
You're on parole.

413
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,828
Another mistake and you're done.

414
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:31,661
Look, next time, detectives,

415
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:35,575
just use a little due diligence
before you haul someone in here.

416
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:42,043
[Indistinct announcement
in background]

417
00:25:44,184 --> 00:25:44,817
Detective Fisher.

418
00:25:44,852 --> 00:25:46,619
Chief.

419
00:25:48,253 --> 00:25:50,555
Mr. Graham.

420
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:53,817
You can't locksmith
without a certificate.

421
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:55,017
I know that, sir.

422
00:25:55,052 --> 00:25:56,360
I'm just a handyman.

423
00:25:56,395 --> 00:25:57,527
Yeah, you mentioned that.

424
00:25:57,562 --> 00:26:00,166
But I don't know
if I believe it.

425
00:26:00,201 --> 00:26:01,290
But as there's no evidence

426
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,200
of any illegal activity
on your part,

427
00:26:03,236 --> 00:26:04,493
you're free to go.

428
00:26:04,528 --> 00:26:07,233
But if I ever see you
in this station again,

429
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:10,075
I will call your parole
officer, you understand that?

430
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,809
I understand.

431
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:15,673
You're free to go.

432
00:26:15,709 --> 00:26:17,276
Uncuff him.

433
00:26:25,983 --> 00:26:27,386
Sharon: Okay.

434
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:30,260
Let's start with having you
come by two times a week.

435
00:26:30,295 --> 00:26:31,255
Twice a week?

436
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,296
Late to your first meeting,
Mr. Graham.

437
00:26:33,331 --> 00:26:34,530
Not a good look.

438
00:26:34,566 --> 00:26:35,901
That's not gonna happen again.

439
00:26:35,936 --> 00:26:37,303
Good.

440
00:26:37,338 --> 00:26:39,736
I'll see you next Monday
on time.

441
00:26:39,772 --> 00:26:42,141
Oh, and grab the cup
on that window outside

442
00:26:42,176 --> 00:26:43,901
with your name on it.

443
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,242
Bathroom's to the left.

444
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:46,243
When you're done,

445
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:48,079
put your sample on the tray
with the others.

446
00:26:48,115 --> 00:26:49,473
Yes, ma'am.

447
00:26:51,175 --> 00:26:53,083
Miller: Frank, you here?

448
00:26:53,118 --> 00:26:54,984
Yeah.

449
00:26:59,853 --> 00:27:02,184
You missed a job.

450
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:03,293
Guy said you stood him up.

451
00:27:03,328 --> 00:27:05,324
Yeah, I'm sorry.

452
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:08,258
Some shit came up today
that was beyond my control.

453
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,159
Frank:
Look, I know you just got out.

454
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,529
But you can't be missing jobs.

455
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:15,235
They got something called
“yelp” nowadays.

456
00:27:17,868 --> 00:27:19,910
Hey uh,

457
00:27:19,946 --> 00:27:22,312
you think you could take me on
as an actual handyman?

458
00:27:22,347 --> 00:27:24,279
Actual handyman.

459
00:27:24,314 --> 00:27:25,643
Huh.

460
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:27,053
Okay.

461
00:27:27,088 --> 00:27:29,144
No bump in pay.

462
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:30,582
There are some benefits.

463
00:27:30,617 --> 00:27:31,986
Yeah?

464
00:27:32,021 --> 00:27:35,918
You get your own special mop
and bucket.

465
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:37,158
[Chuckles]

466
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,332
Okay, indie, paw, paw.

467
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,234
Beth: Linds, come on!

468
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:43,432
We're gonna be late.

469
00:27:43,468 --> 00:27:44,432
I'm almost ready.

470
00:27:44,468 --> 00:27:46,765
Shake, good.

471
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,336
Yes, good job.

472
00:27:48,371 --> 00:27:48,998
Ready?

473
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:50,941
This isn't ready.

474
00:27:50,976 --> 00:27:53,468
Is that what you're wearing
to the party tonight?

475
00:27:53,504 --> 00:27:55,478
I'm not going
to the party tonight.

476
00:27:55,513 --> 00:27:56,781
Allison can't come over,

477
00:27:56,817 --> 00:28:00,009
so I thought you
and I could make some popcorn

478
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,321
and watch a movie.

479
00:28:02,356 --> 00:28:04,055
Why, what's wrong with this?

480
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:04,585
Nothing.

481
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,490
It looks fine.

482
00:28:06,525 --> 00:28:08,794
Why don't you just ask dad?

483
00:28:08,829 --> 00:28:10,823
I think your father needs just
a little more time

484
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:12,731
getting settled in.

485
00:28:12,766 --> 00:28:15,427
If he's not busy,
I'm sure he can handle it.

486
00:28:15,462 --> 00:28:17,376
And you can go to the party
and have fun for once.

487
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:17,893
[Gasps]

488
00:28:17,928 --> 00:28:18,633
Fun?

489
00:28:18,668 --> 00:28:20,338
Remind me what that is?

490
00:28:20,373 --> 00:28:21,030
I'll think about it.

491
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,434
Come on, let's go.

492
00:28:23,067 --> 00:28:24,837
[Officers cheer]

493
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:26,310
Guys, yeah, alright.

494
00:28:26,346 --> 00:28:28,008
Alright, alright.

495
00:28:28,044 --> 00:28:29,945
Lieutenant zwick's work
with this force

496
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,542
has been a deep service
to our community

497
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:36,321
and I would like to personally
congratulate him

498
00:28:36,356 --> 00:28:38,356
on an incredible career.

499
00:28:38,391 --> 00:28:40,091
Officers: Yeah.

500
00:28:40,126 --> 00:28:41,519
Speech!

501
00:28:45,496 --> 00:28:47,500
Um, I'm just...

502
00:28:47,535 --> 00:28:49,401
I'm happy
to have left the streets

503
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:51,894
of dos caminos a little safer.

504
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:53,298
And uh,

505
00:28:53,334 --> 00:28:55,508
serving with some of the
borderland's finest

506
00:28:55,543 --> 00:28:59,311
has been the honor
of my lifetime.

507
00:28:59,346 --> 00:29:02,246
And so uh, thank you.

508
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:04,843
Um, and...

509
00:29:04,878 --> 00:29:05,950
One more thing.

510
00:29:07,513 --> 00:29:10,512
Miller Graham,
the man I put away the night

511
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,581
I was under fire
in the line of duty

512
00:29:12,616 --> 00:29:15,760
has recently been released
from prison.

513
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:19,392
So uh, watch your six out
there, fellas.

514
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,594
Oh, and of course,

515
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:27,371
attendance at my party later on
is mandatory, alright.

516
00:29:27,407 --> 00:29:28,808
Fisher, my office.

517
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:40,182
Beth, with my retirement
we are down a man on vice.

518
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:45,189
I'd like you to fill that slot.

519
00:29:45,224 --> 00:29:45,751
Wow.

520
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:46,786
[Chuckles]

521
00:29:46,821 --> 00:29:48,392
Really, um...

522
00:29:48,428 --> 00:29:50,494
Here you go, boys.

523
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:52,329
I'm just a little um...

524
00:29:52,364 --> 00:29:54,056
Surprised?

525
00:29:54,091 --> 00:29:55,067
[Chuckles]

526
00:29:55,102 --> 00:29:55,367
Yes.

527
00:29:55,402 --> 00:29:57,392
Yeah.

528
00:29:57,427 --> 00:29:59,562
I'm not as stupid as I look.

529
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:02,441
And I'm sure it hasn't always
been easy

530
00:30:02,476 --> 00:30:04,109
having me as a supervisor

531
00:30:04,144 --> 00:30:07,503
given what happened between me
and that asshole ex of yours.

532
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,507
Just consider this my way
of saying,

533
00:30:09,543 --> 00:30:12,049
I always thought you were
good police, Fisher.

534
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,083
Oh well, I...

535
00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:19,122
I can't just drop
my other cases.

536
00:30:20,493 --> 00:30:21,493
Yeah, by the way,

537
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,825
I wouldn't worry too much
about that.

538
00:30:23,861 --> 00:30:26,495
Those will all get transitioned.

539
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,590
This is...

540
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:29,693
This is the real police work
here, you know.

541
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:35,974
Beth, these men can't drink
their whisky until you accept.

542
00:30:43,515 --> 00:30:44,039
Then I accept.

543
00:30:44,074 --> 00:30:44,810
Whoo!

544
00:30:44,846 --> 00:30:45,812
There it is.

545
00:30:45,847 --> 00:30:46,847
[Men chuckling]

546
00:30:49,653 --> 00:30:50,353
Ah, there it is.

547
00:30:50,388 --> 00:30:51,049
Alright.

548
00:30:51,084 --> 00:30:52,114
Out of here, all of you.

549
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:52,986
Thank you.

550
00:30:53,022 --> 00:30:53,621
We'll see you out there, Fisher.

551
00:30:53,656 --> 00:30:54,656
Yes, yes.

552
00:31:00,566 --> 00:31:02,528
Oh, lieutenant, um...

553
00:31:02,564 --> 00:31:04,961
What is it exactly that you'd
like me to jump into?

554
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,229
Oh.

555
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:07,332
Yeah, just you know,

556
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:08,300
just really dig
into the case files.

Hello?

00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,765
<i>Beth (on phone): Hey.</i>

563
00:31:41,801 --> 00:31:45,403
Um, there's this thing tonight
at the king of spades.

<i>Beth (on phone): Yeah.</i>

566
00:31:47,915 --> 00:31:49,679
I was wondering if you could
pick Lindsay up

567
00:31:49,714 --> 00:31:50,882
from her piano lesson

568
00:31:50,917 --> 00:31:52,941
and spend a little bit
of time with her.

569
00:31:52,976 --> 00:31:55,487
I usually ask the neighbor,
but she's not around.

570
00:31:55,522 --> 00:31:56,379
No, I would love that.

571
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,515
<i>Beth (on phone): Great.</i>

572
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,557
Okay, so,
you got to go over her homework,

573
00:31:59,592 --> 00:32:00,450
make sure she's done it.

574
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:01,818

575
00:32:04,264 --> 00:32:05,924
Okay.

00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:06,862
Homework.

577
00:32:06,898 --> 00:32:10,028
And no fast food, real dinner.

578
00:32:10,063 --> 00:32:12,070
No fast food.

579
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,229
Okay, what else?

580
00:32:14,264 --> 00:32:15,174
That's it.

581
00:32:15,209 --> 00:32:16,701
Oh.

582
00:32:17,768 --> 00:32:19,609
I can drop her off at your
house after...

583
00:32:19,644 --> 00:32:20,236
Uh no, no, no.

584
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,039
The bar is fine.

585
00:32:21,074 --> 00:32:22,511
Uh, I gotta go.

00:32:22,546 --> 00:32:23,073
Okay.

Hey.

Alright, let's bounce.

00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,262
Okay.

Do you anything you're really
good at?

00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,140
Mhmmm.

611
00:33:33,752 --> 00:33:35,120
Will you show me?

612
00:33:39,087 --> 00:33:40,019
I see that smile.

Alright.

615
00:33:43,997 --> 00:33:45,658
Give me a couple
of your Bobby pins.

616
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:50,458
Okay.

617
00:33:50,494 --> 00:33:51,529
Most people think

618
00:33:51,564 --> 00:33:53,566
picking locks
is like mysterious.

619
00:33:53,602 --> 00:33:56,568
But locks are actually kind
of easy to crack.

620
00:33:56,603 --> 00:33:58,239
You don't even need a kit
like I use.

621
00:33:58,275 --> 00:34:01,745
Alright,
so this is your tension lever.

622
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,774
And this is your pick.

623
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,193
So, we're going
to take the tension lever

624
00:34:06,217 --> 00:34:08,811
and stick it in the bottom
of the lock.

625
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:10,689
Okay, now there's five pins
in this lock.

626
00:34:10,724 --> 00:34:12,685
We're gonna take the pick

627
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,851
and put it in the lock
just above the tension lever.

628
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:20,231
And we're going to feel
for the pins.

629
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,391
Now, one of the pins is
gonna be harder to push up

630
00:34:22,426 --> 00:34:23,735
than the others.

631
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:25,794
It's called the "seized pin".

632
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,538
And that's the one
we're looking for.

633
00:34:28,573 --> 00:34:30,574
So...

634
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,567
Okay there.

635
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:33,002
There, there, there, that guy.

636
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:37,149
Right now push him up
while you turn the tension lever

637
00:34:39,784 --> 00:34:41,978
and guess what?

638
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:48,052

let them keep hurting me?

Kevin was my real family.

He was the only family
I ever had.

of prostitution arrests

743
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:51,988
in the last three years.

744
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:54,156
Like I said, Fisher, small town.

745
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:56,666
What, people don't pay
for sex in small towns.

746
00:39:59,837 --> 00:40:02,104
Miller: Yo, I thought you
said this was a poker game.

747
00:40:02,139 --> 00:40:03,442
April: It is.

748
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:07,044
Looks like a whole fucking

749
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:08,739
That's a lot of eyes.

750

It's nothing you can't handle.

751
00:40:11,778 --> 00:40:13,050
Garrett does this every month.

752
00:40:13,085 --> 00:40:14,085
He dresses up the game

753
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:17,379
like it's some
classy casino night.

754
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:19,984
Charges a high buy-in,
the buy-in goes into the pot.

755
00:40:20,019 --> 00:40:21,333
And then he takes a big cut
for hosting,

756
00:40:21,357 --> 00:40:22,559
on top of what he makes

757
00:40:22,594 --> 00:40:24,204
from the girls working
the players all night.

758
00:40:24,228 --> 00:40:25,389
And who are the players?

759
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:27,159
Execs.

760
00:40:27,194 --> 00:40:29,068
Business types that drive
into town just for the game.

761
00:40:29,092 --> 00:40:31,032
They're definitely not trouble.

and I'll meet you back
at frank's

765
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,051
when I'm done for the night.

766
00:40:37,075 --> 00:40:39,340
What's the take?

767
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:40,604
Half a million dollars.

768
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:41,609
Miller: What?

769
00:40:41,645 --> 00:40:43,112
That's a fucking shit ton
of money.

April: Yeah.

771
00:40:44,174 --> 00:40:45,494

to start a new life.

Miller: So, what about security?

773
00:40:50,947 --> 00:40:52,315
You're looking at it.

774
00:40:57,393 --> 00:40:59,025
Why am I not surprised?

775
00:41:00,164 --> 00:41:01,423
Three years ago,

776
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,606
all these women were picked up
on prostitution charges.

777
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,803
Then arrests dry up.

778
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:06,598
Okay.

779
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:07,635
So, we booked them,

780
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,600
they stopped turning
their tricks.

781
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:10,137
Sounds like a win to me.

782
00:41:10,172 --> 00:41:11,032
No, no.

783
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,841
Come here, look at the files.

784
00:41:19,179 --> 00:41:21,646
Each woman gives the same
street as their address.

Well, maybe you're right.

789
00:41:28,453 --> 00:41:31,726
Maybe they all just found
different forms of occupation.

790
00:41:31,761 --> 00:41:34,124
Or, maybe whoever
they're working for

791

at her apartment.

929
00:49:58,769 --> 00:50:00,832
And now, she's just...

930
00:50:00,867 --> 00:50:02,402
Gone.

931
00:50:02,437 --> 00:50:05,366
This morning I see Miller going
into her place.

932
00:50:05,401 --> 00:50:07,302
Beth: Miller?

933
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,171
Are you sure?

934
00:50:09,207 --> 00:50:11,049
It was him.

935
00:50:15,585 --> 00:50:17,550
Shit.

936
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:26,658
This is a job April asked you
to pull.

937
00:50:31,834 --> 00:50:33,830
Are you insane?

938
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:35,698
I can explain...

939
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:38,202
No, that's a serious question
I'm asking

940
00:50:38,237 --> 00:50:39,776
and I need an answer.

941
00:50:39,811 --> 00:50:41,710
Are you out of your mind?

942
00:50:41,745 --> 00:50:42,745
They took her.

943
00:50:42,779 --> 00:50:44,139
She's missing.

944
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:45,306
Oh.

945
00:50:45,341 --> 00:50:46,684
Oh, I'm...

946
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:49,814
I'm trying to understand,

947
00:50:49,849 --> 00:50:55,222
why you would get yourself
involved in something like this?

948
00:50:55,257 --> 00:50:57,728
Do you want to go back
to prison?

949
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,829
They're hurting her, frank.

950
00:50:59,864 --> 00:51:02,032
She showed me the bruises.

951
00:51:02,067 --> 00:51:03,925
Okay, this girls needs
to get out of town

952
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,680
and this was the only way
she could think of

953
00:51:05,704 --> 00:51:06,604
to get the money.

954
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:08,666
The part I'm missing is,

955
00:51:08,702 --> 00:51:12,841
you explaining how
that's your responsibility.

956
00:51:12,876 --> 00:51:15,475
'Cause I owe her.

957
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:17,775
What am I supposed to do
just let her get killed?

958
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:26,256
Look, I know you have
a tough choice to make.

959
00:51:28,123 --> 00:51:30,584
But you made the wrong one.

960
00:51:30,619 --> 00:51:32,256
You gotta go to Beth.

961
00:51:32,291 --> 00:51:34,258
She's the one you owe.

962
00:51:34,293 --> 00:51:35,766
Take this cash back.

963
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,701
Tell her to go find April.

964
00:51:37,736 --> 00:51:38,801
And let her do her job.

965
00:51:38,836 --> 00:51:40,703
It's not that simple.

966
00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:41,664
Zwick's involved.

967
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:42,777
Well, that's even more
of a reason

968
00:51:42,801 --> 00:51:44,840
why you need to tell her
to watch your back.

969
00:51:44,875 --> 00:51:46,878
It's too dangerous.

970
00:51:46,913 --> 00:51:48,878
Trust me,
she's safer not knowing.

971
00:51:48,914 --> 00:51:50,211
I gotta handle this on my own.

972
00:51:50,246 --> 00:51:52,749
You better hope
that you find her

973
00:51:52,784 --> 00:51:55,645

She's there, I know it.

Can I please just keep this
in the safe for one night?

977
00:52:06,898 --> 00:52:07,695

Yeah.

1015

She lives across the street
from April.

1016
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,093
Thinks she saw something
the other night.

1017

no one answered.

I know they're dirty.

The reason I fell in love
with you,

it's because you do anything
for the people you care about.

That's also the reason
I let you go.
