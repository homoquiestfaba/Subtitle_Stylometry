a brother... he's a asshole.

No, we're not sisters, but, um,
it was nice meeting you, Edgar.

So instead of watching hot-looking guys
with washboard stomachs on the beach,

we're gonna hang out with Edgar, the
300-pound axe murderer, instead.

335
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:08,460

doesn't make him an axe murderer.

So what are we doing
tonight? I'm getting bored.

the shore in that traffic again.

we do around here?

club. Those things don't exist around here.

that or stay here all night

us through the windows.

you on your tour.

(JUNIOR) Well, there are
people that live around here.

364

Yeah, we heard there are a few dozen Piney
families who are all inbred, illiterate,

and very hostile towards outsiders,
living just about a mile down the road.

- Mm-hmm?

- Where do<i> you</i> live?
- 'Bout a mile down the road.

369
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:09,664
Now, believe it or not, the
Jersey Devil was the 13th child

370
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:15,920
of a woman named Deborah Leeds who
emigrated from London, England

371
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:20,258
here to the New Jersey
Pine Barrens in the 1700s.

Moving here from London and all,
was she able to learn English?

That's a pretty good question. I'll
have to get back to you on that.

difficult and painful labor,
