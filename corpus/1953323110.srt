1
00:00:05,504 --> 00:00:08,042
It's about to come, it's about
to come, it's about to come.

2
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,416
In your face, in your hair.

3
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:33,899
I can't believe you bid
$1200 for this.

4
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,244
I have a really good feeling
about this. Trust me.

5
00:00:45,244 --> 00:00:50,648
d Yes, you sure
Bought this all d

6
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:55,620
d And now you're rollin'
In this heap d

7
00:00:55,621 --> 00:01:00,258
d But you paid You paid d

8
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:05,997
d You paid for this dirty
Berber rug d

9
00:01:05,998 --> 00:01:09,734
Which isn't actually so bad,
because I think

10
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:12,742
you can get these stains out
with a little club soda.

11
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:18,076
This is all worthless.

12
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:21,581
Keep looking.
We'll find something.

13
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:24,485
Bingo.

14
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:29,288
This is ridiculous, Michelle.
It's such a waste of time.

15
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,358
What's that?

16
00:01:33,358 --> 00:01:35,827
"Found footage" that we found.

17
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:37,661
Wouldn't it be amazing
if it was one of those

18
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:39,862
celebrity sex tapes and
we could sell it for millions?

19
00:01:39,863 --> 00:01:41,667
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
Put it in.

20
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,305
All right.

21
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,880
<i>Carlsbad Police,
what's your emergency?</i>

22
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:57,148
<i>Five.</i>

23
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:58,550
<i>Excuse me?</i>

24
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:01,051
<i>Five.</i>

25
00:02:01,052 --> 00:02:02,487
<i>Five.</i>

26
00:02:02,488 --> 00:02:04,522
<i>Five what, ma'am?</i>

27
00:02:04,523 --> 00:02:10,328
<i>d Five dollar footlong d</i>

28
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:12,329
<i>Ma'am, what's your emergency?</i>

29
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,232
<i>I'm a man, douche bag.</i>

30
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:16,899
<i>My voice is altered because
I've got eight demons in me</i>

31
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,635
<i>all taking turns to speak.</i>

32
00:02:18,636 --> 00:02:20,837
<i>- Anyway, I killed five people.
- I'm sorry?</i>

33
00:02:20,838 --> 00:02:24,208
<i>I served them six-inch tuna
subs that I wiped my ass with.</i>

34
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:25,911
<i>They all died
from toxoplasmosis.</i>

35
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,079
<i>Who?</i>

36
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,716
<i>The entire cast of The Artist,
including that dog Uggie.</i>

37
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,083
<i>What?</i>

38
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:33,984
<i>Send the police, jerk-off.</i>

39
00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:36,922
<i>And if you're hungry, I still
have half a sandwich left.</i>

40
00:02:41,827 --> 00:02:44,861
<i>The Carlsbad community
was leveled by tragedy today</i>

41
00:02:44,862 --> 00:02:46,502
<i>as three clergy members
were found dead.</i>

42
00:02:47,032 --> 00:02:50,201
At 11:47 p.m. in the evening,

43
00:02:50,202 --> 00:02:55,106
there was a call into our office
in a facsimile

44
00:02:55,107 --> 00:03:01,044
saying that there may have been
or might be a murder situation.

45
00:03:01,045 --> 00:03:04,250
<i>But we cannot confirm or deny
that the cast of the film,</i>

46
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:08,752
<i>The Artist, has been murdered
in the basement of this house.</i>

47
00:03:08,753 --> 00:03:14,300
I, myself, am not a fan of
the film. Didn't really get it.

48
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,868
Hi, my name is Dana Rosti,

49
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:26,537
and we're shooting
a documentary.

50
00:03:26,538 --> 00:03:29,039
Why are you shooting
a documentary?

51
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,075
Well, when I was 10 years old,

52
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:34,445
my father murdered some people
in our basement.

53
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:36,914
And I just found out
that he murdered them

54
00:03:36,915 --> 00:03:39,984
while an exorcism
was being performed.

55
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:41,485
<i>On him.</i>

56
00:03:41,486 --> 00:03:43,086
<i>By clowns.</i>

57
00:03:43,087 --> 00:03:45,055
<i>Without his pants.</i>

58
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:48,595
I'm sorry,
can we stop for a second?

59
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:52,095
<i>After six months
of going to trial,</i>

60
00:03:52,096 --> 00:03:53,666
<i>my dad was proven not guilty</i>

61
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:57,501
<i>based on insanity,
but I didn't believe that.</i>

62
00:03:57,502 --> 00:03:59,740
Wait a minute.

63
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,643
Yeah! Ragh! Ragh!

64
00:04:05,644 --> 00:04:08,446
It's the Olympics. Whoo!

65
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:12,450
Oh! Hello. Ugh!

66
00:04:14,353 --> 00:04:16,021
How about a five-way?

67
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:19,122
<i>A year later,
he was transferred</i>

68
00:04:19,123 --> 00:04:21,526
<i>to one of the top psychiatric
facilities in the world.</i>

69
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,861
Which happens to be in Italy,

70
00:04:23,862 --> 00:04:26,867
which is, like,
in a whole other country.

71
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:31,135
- Are we recording?
- We're on.

72
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:33,470
- And this is camera one?
- Yeah.

73
00:04:33,471 --> 00:04:35,972
And this is camera two?

74
00:04:35,973 --> 00:04:38,176
And this is the Steadicam.

75
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:39,177
And this is my 3D camera?

76
00:04:43,115 --> 00:04:46,019
And this is
my motion-capture camera?

77
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:49,953
Okay.

78
00:04:49,954 --> 00:04:51,522
Let's do this.

79
00:04:51,523 --> 00:04:53,524
You came on a very good day
today, Miss Rosti.

80
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:57,895
Your father is
in very high spirits.

81
00:04:57,896 --> 00:05:01,898
<i>Italy had cutting-edge
equipment, brilliant doctors.</i>

82
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:06,037
I need three CCs
of marinara, stat.

83
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:09,305
So listen, there's a good chance
he might not even remember you.

84
00:05:09,306 --> 00:05:11,575
- Okay.
- Don't take offense to that.

85
00:05:11,576 --> 00:05:14,413
- It's just part of the disease.
- Right.

86
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:24,554
Okay.

87
00:05:24,555 --> 00:05:27,995
Let's just go
with one camera, okay? Great.

88
00:05:35,934 --> 00:05:39,738
Dad? Do you remember me?

89
00:05:40,738 --> 00:05:42,108
Connect the dots.

90
00:05:44,108 --> 00:05:48,179
Connect the dots. Connect the
dots. Connect the dots.

91
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,881
- Connecticut.
- No, dumb-ass.

92
00:05:50,882 --> 00:05:52,017
Connect the dots.

93
00:05:53,017 --> 00:05:55,284
I'd rather play Candy Land
or Jenga or something...

94
00:05:55,285 --> 00:05:57,923
I'd rather play Connect the Dots
and Dana Shut Up.

95
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,531
Okay.

96
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,931
Great. Now give me your phone.

97
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:09,365
- What?
- Give me your phone.

98
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:11,567
Give me your phone.
Give me your phone.

99
00:06:11,568 --> 00:06:14,142
- I'm getting it out of my purse.
- Give me your phone.

100
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:19,210
And, bam!

101
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:20,946
You just bought me
two Taiwanese hookers

102
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:24,047
for the price of one
on Croupon. Hm?

103
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:26,818
Listen, I came here

104
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,255
because I have to tell you
something really important.

105
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:31,329
Shh.

106
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:41,265
- Dad.
- Now get out of here.

107
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:43,435
I ain't got time for you
no more.

108
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:47,638
"Out," he said. Away with you.

109
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,075
Out. I'm a pretty princess.

110
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:53,744
- Say it!
- You're a pretty princess.

111
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:55,014
- Louder!
- You okay?

112
00:06:56,014 --> 00:06:58,316
Yeah, I'm fine.

113
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,451
Finally. Ling Mi One
and Ling Mi Two.

114
00:07:01,452 --> 00:07:03,420
Who's sitting on my face first?

115
00:07:03,421 --> 00:07:04,323
<i>Since that day,</i>

116
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:07,964
<i>I never went back
to see my old man.</i>

117
00:07:12,964 --> 00:07:14,798
<i>While I was building a career,</i>

118
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:16,935
<i>I was looking for
the man of my dreams.</i>

119
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,669
<i>And I found him</i>

120
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:22,507
<i>the way all attention-seeking
narcissist slut-bags do.</i>

121
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:33,019
- Dana.
- Oh!

122
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:36,021
That's me.
That's not you guys.

123
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:41,062
Okay, here. Just hold that.
That's for you. Okay.

124
00:07:44,062 --> 00:07:46,496
Will you accept this rose?

125
00:07:46,497 --> 00:07:48,540
I would love to.

126
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,142
Okay.

127
00:07:58,142 --> 00:07:59,042
Okay.

128
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:00,645
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

129
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,648
Want this? Yeah, oh,
ride that donkey.

130
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,248
Yeah. Yeah.

131
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:06,317
- Yeah. Join in, dude. Join in.
- Come on.

132
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:08,886
<i>Aaron and I fell in love</i>

133
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:11,658
<i>and got married
three months later.</i>

134
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:18,528
<i>He had a beautiful 2-year-old
daughter named Liz.</i>

135
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:22,197
And a New York strip for you,
young lady. Oh, I forgot.

136
00:08:22,198 --> 00:08:24,166
<i>It was just a matter of time</i>

137
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:26,505
<i>before I picked up
the whole mothering thing.</i>

138
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,541
- It's good.
- All right.

139
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,575
Can't have a steak
without your steak knife.

140
00:08:32,576 --> 00:08:34,245
- Good girl.
- Good girl.

141
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:36,247
Yummy.

142
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:39,955
Okay, eat up, ducky,
they're starving in Africa.

143
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:45,723
<i>Ah, Liz grew up so fast.</i>

144
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:48,057
<i>She was your typical
teenage daughter,</i>

145
00:08:48,058 --> 00:08:49,760
<i>with a few issues to work out.</i>

146
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:53,100
Oh, no, honey, now, don't.
Don't... Ah!

147
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,066
<i>We had Jonah about a year ago.</i>

148
00:08:57,067 --> 00:08:58,769
<i>People say
we're overprotective,</i>

149
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,104
<i>but I don't really see it.</i>

150
00:09:01,105 --> 00:09:03,706
<i>Our family was growing,
so it was time</i>

151
00:09:03,707 --> 00:09:06,142
<i>to move out of our cramped
one-bedroom rental</i>

152
00:09:06,143 --> 00:09:09,145
<i>that we shared with
the 12-member Rodriguez family.</i>

153
00:09:09,146 --> 00:09:10,814
<i>After an exhaustive search,</i>

154
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:13,918
<i>I found that the house
I grew up in was available.</i>

155
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,721
- This is amazing.
- It's so peaceful here, honey.

156
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:19,322
I know, sweetheart.

157
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:21,759
Another big milestone
for the Galen family.

158
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,465
Okay. Let's do this.

159
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,766
Okay.

160
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:30,467
Welcome to the new house,
everyone.

161
00:09:30,468 --> 00:09:32,068
Well, this is
my beautiful daughter

162
00:09:32,069 --> 00:09:33,802
coming down our new stairs.

163
00:09:33,803 --> 00:09:37,576
There is my little man with
my favorite gal. Hello, sweetie.

164
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,777
Okay.

165
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:41,912
This house will work.

166
00:09:41,913 --> 00:09:44,783
I just took the biggest
dump upstairs.

167
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:48,952
Felipe.

168
00:09:48,953 --> 00:09:52,590
- Yes, missus?
- It's time for Jonah's bath.

169
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:56,127
Oh, no, no, no. Sorry, not
tonight, missus.

170
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,030
Just kidding.

171
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,132
- Baby, come over here.
- If I may propose a little toast?

172
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:04,003
- Very romantic.
- Oh, well, thank you.

173
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:07,706
To nothing but beautiful
memories in our new home.

174
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:08,973
Oh, babe.

175
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:10,014
- I love you.
- I love you.

176
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:13,451
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

177
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:21,316
Make sure you record
every moment.

178
00:10:21,317 --> 00:10:23,219
This is gonna be
riveting to watch.

179
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,289
I just wanna document our first
full week in this house.

180
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,523
I'll edit it later.

181
00:10:27,524 --> 00:10:29,892
It's all part of
the master plan, babe.

182
00:10:29,893 --> 00:10:31,297
I'm gonna do it
at the same time.

183
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:33,532
It's so...

184
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:36,702
Ooh, text.

185
00:10:37,702 --> 00:10:39,704
- Yes.
- What?

186
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,071
I got the meeting.

187
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:43,874
- Honey, that's wonderful.
- I know.

188
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,043
Oh, they wanna schedule it
for next week.

189
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:48,413
Oh, baby, I'm so proud of you.

190
00:10:50,148 --> 00:10:52,882
This is a big deal, honey.
It's the Umbrella Corporation.

191
00:10:52,883 --> 00:10:56,419
If I get this, I won't have
to consult for anyone again.

192
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,854
And you won't have to work
the corners anymore.

193
00:10:58,855 --> 00:11:01,692
Oh, baby, you've worked
so hard for this.

194
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:03,062
Thank you.

195
00:11:05,062 --> 00:11:08,033
Hey, you feel like
christening the new house?

196
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,100
Well, the kids are asleep.

197
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:12,435
- You know how to turn me on.
- Yeah?

198
00:11:12,436 --> 00:11:14,072
Wanna move some boxes, baby?

199
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:17,277
Oh, the only box
I'm interested in is yours.

200
00:11:25,716 --> 00:11:28,793
Either one of you losers
might wanna take care of this.

201
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:35,827
You should get out.

202
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:39,197
Mommy and Daddy
are playing gardener.

203
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:43,633
Order a pizza.

204
00:11:43,634 --> 00:11:45,035
Mushrooms?

205
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:48,875
Green peppers and mushrooms.

206
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:56,046
First full night in this house,
total awesomeness.

207
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:58,315
Let me get this here.

208
00:11:58,316 --> 00:12:00,586
There we go.

209
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,091
What? What? What is this mess?

210
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:09,627
Who tossed around
all the furniture?

211
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,061
Liz, what the hell
happened here?

212
00:12:12,062 --> 00:12:15,100
Don't know. I was just about
to post my nudes on Twitter

213
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:18,303
and then I came in here
and saw this.

214
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,009
Baby? Dana?

215
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:28,077
What the hell?
Who redecorated the room?

216
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:30,514
You know,
it's actually pretty nice,

217
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:32,615
in a retro kind of way.

218
00:12:32,616 --> 00:12:36,120
Honey, it looks like Neil
Patrick Harris threw up in here.

219
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:39,260
Oh, for chrissakes.

220
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,599
Oh, my God.

221
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,767
Wait. What?

222
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,367
Dana doesn't know how to cook.

223
00:12:51,368 --> 00:12:53,538
Where did all this food
come from?

224
00:12:54,538 --> 00:12:57,009
Aaron, what the hell
is going on here?

225
00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:01,144
Yeah, Dad,
this is fucking weird.

226
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:03,146
But for some reason,
I wanna shoot it.

227
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:04,980
I don't know what
this is either.

228
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:07,550
Could be your classic
suburban burglar

229
00:13:07,551 --> 00:13:09,486
or a practical joke
by Martha Stewart.

230
00:13:09,487 --> 00:13:12,189
- You're wrong on both counts.
- Heh.

231
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,992
It's just sweet old me,
Paula Bean.

232
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:19,130
I just wanted y'all to taste
my new low-fat recipe.

233
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:32,647
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

234
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:38,250
You guys shooting a reality show
or something?

235
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:41,317
No. No, that's my daughter Liz.
Hi, babe.

236
00:13:41,318 --> 00:13:43,153
Hey, sunshine.

237
00:13:43,154 --> 00:13:45,755
You like things that dangle?

238
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:48,391
We're gonna saturate this space
with cameras.

239
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:50,526
Okay? I'm gonna put one up
in that corner.

240
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:52,228
Right? That way you get it
coming this way.

241
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:54,830
One up in this corner,
opposite direction, boom.

242
00:13:54,831 --> 00:13:56,533
One from the dining room, bam.

243
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:59,103
Triangulation of coverage.

244
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:01,938
Put one over the stove, right,
get it pointed this way.

245
00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:04,339
One on top of the TV,
pointed this way,

246
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,242
that way we get the full
coverage in here, okay?

247
00:14:06,243 --> 00:14:08,210
- All right, yeah. That's good.
- Okay.

248
00:14:08,211 --> 00:14:10,613
Oh, I forgot to put this
on the list.

249
00:14:10,614 --> 00:14:12,783
Oh, you can install a camera
on this?

250
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:15,518
No. To fuck on.

251
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,088
Then I install a camera.
Ha-ha-ha!

252
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:20,758
Okay, there's more house.
Let's go.

253
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,892
We got one
directly above the crib

254
00:14:22,893 --> 00:14:24,697
and then one over here
up the bunny's ass.

255
00:14:26,697 --> 00:14:28,032
Hey.

256
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,433
This seems sturdy, right?

257
00:14:29,434 --> 00:14:31,802
Good for a nice blowing, right?

258
00:14:31,803 --> 00:14:34,304
You just slide in between
the slats and then...

259
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:36,539
We'll get another one right here
coming in.

260
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,442
We got this one
pointed directly this way

261
00:14:38,443 --> 00:14:41,110
and then one
directly over the bed.

262
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:44,214
- Wait, why our bed?
- Don't worry about it.

263
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:47,451
Oh, look at this fucking
great bathroom.

264
00:14:47,452 --> 00:14:49,987
Oh, shit,
this is fucking beautiful.

265
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:52,588
We're gonna stick one here
pointed at the bathtub.

266
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:55,293
We got one high in this corner,
directed at the shower.

267
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,494
And then one in the toilet.

268
00:14:57,495 --> 00:14:59,966
- Excuse me?
- Huh?

269
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:19,176
What are you doing in my shower?

270
00:16:19,177 --> 00:16:22,986
Get out, out, out.

271
00:16:28,986 --> 00:16:30,657
Really?

272
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:34,224
Sorry.

273
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:36,605
These are my nieces.

274
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,618
I love the pool heaters.

275
00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:03,720
I love the pool heaters.

276
00:17:03,721 --> 00:17:06,440
I love the pool heaters.

277
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:53,069
Morning, honey.

278
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,172
Somebody slept in this morning.

279
00:17:56,173 --> 00:17:58,342
I like sleeping.

280
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:02,512
Especially when it's
sweet dreams about you.

281
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:04,581
- What?
- What is that?

282
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:07,651
- What?
- There's writing on your face.

283
00:18:07,652 --> 00:18:11,323
Oh, yeah, I do that every night.
It's good for the skin.

284
00:18:12,323 --> 00:18:15,625
What the hell is going on here?

285
00:18:15,626 --> 00:18:18,161
And this is exactly why
we have cameras,

286
00:18:18,162 --> 00:18:20,099
so we can get to the bottom
of this stuff.

287
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:23,700
What the...

288
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:26,035
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, honey,
we have ghosts.

289
00:18:26,036 --> 00:18:28,036
Okay, okay.
No, honey, it's okay.

290
00:18:28,037 --> 00:18:29,939
I think you're being
a little over dramatic.

291
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,275
Oh, I'm sorry, really?
What would you call that?

292
00:18:32,276 --> 00:18:34,112
It could be a million
different things.

293
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,180
Like what?

294
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:40,183
Could be the air conditioning,
window was left open.

295
00:18:40,184 --> 00:18:41,451
Scientologists.

296
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:44,320
No. I am sorry, honey,
those are ghosts

297
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:46,189
and I am freaking out right now.

298
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,826
Okay, Dana. Dana, look at me.
Calm down, okay?

299
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,560
They're not ghosts.

300
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:56,033
There is no such thing
as ghosts. Trust me.

301
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,166
Okay, fine.

302
00:18:57,167 --> 00:18:59,303
Attention, all ghosts.

303
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,639
If you're here with us right now
in this house

304
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,077
for the love of Jesus,
give us a sign.

305
00:19:07,077 --> 00:19:11,815
Okay. I guess you're right,
honey.

306
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:13,519
Ohh...

307
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:17,521
Goddamn Scientologists.

308
00:19:26,364 --> 00:19:29,032
I just don't understand
why this is happening to us.

309
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:31,067
I think I do.

310
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:33,239
What?

311
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:38,443
It all started when I was 7.

312
00:19:39,443 --> 00:19:41,544
<i>I was getting drunk
with my sister.</i>

313
00:19:41,545 --> 00:19:42,944
<i>We'd use tiny teacups,</i>

314
00:19:42,945 --> 00:19:45,213
<i>that way our parents
never knew.</i>

315
00:19:45,214 --> 00:19:47,115
- Don't put that there.
- Why?

316
00:19:47,116 --> 00:19:48,950
Because Jeremy's sitting there.

317
00:19:48,951 --> 00:19:51,088
Jillian, you gotta stop
with this ghost thing.

318
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:52,456
You sound crazy.

319
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:55,460
I'm not crazy,
I'm just telling you the truth.

320
00:19:58,128 --> 00:20:02,299
Sorry, Jillian, that one was
a little tougher to pinch off.

321
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,036
Okay. Tea me up.

322
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:08,103
But Jeremy Lin wasn't even
a Knick back then.

323
00:20:08,104 --> 00:20:10,439
And I didn't know
you had a sister.

324
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,111
She was deported
to Guatemala when I was 10.

325
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:15,045
But that's not the point.

326
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:17,248
The point is that
two years after that,

327
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:20,651
<i>my father killed the entire cast
of The Artist,</i>

328
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:23,319
including Uggie the dog.

329
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,056
Why? That was a great movie.

330
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:29,294
Frankly, I don't understand why
the whole film had to be silent.

331
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:30,927
But anyway,

332
00:20:30,928 --> 00:20:33,261
it wasn't until I was
20 years old that I found out

333
00:20:33,262 --> 00:20:36,769
my father killed those
people during an exorcism.

334
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,169
What?

335
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,572
- I know. It's crazy, huh?
- Yeah.

336
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:46,174
He's been in a psychiatric
hospital in Italy ever since.

337
00:20:46,175 --> 00:20:48,177
Who's the person that
walked you down the aisle

338
00:20:48,178 --> 00:20:49,946
and comes over
for the holidays?

339
00:20:49,947 --> 00:20:53,150
Oh, sweetie.
He's just an actor.

340
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:56,186
His name's Joel Solomon.
He's very talented.

341
00:20:56,187 --> 00:20:58,755
I called him Pop-Pop.

342
00:20:58,756 --> 00:21:00,289
Listen, I...

343
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,958
I really think we should call in
the Ghost Brothers.

344
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:06,495
No way. Honey, those guys are
scam artists. You know that. No.

345
00:21:06,496 --> 00:21:08,300
Okay. Are you coming to bed?

346
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,701
Not yet, I'm only halfway done
with this, honey.

347
00:21:12,702 --> 00:21:14,584
I need at least 45 more minutes.

348
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:02,019
<i>d Babe d</i>

349
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:06,823
<i>d I've missed your touch d</i>

350
00:22:06,824 --> 00:22:09,766
<i>d It's long since we... d</i>

351
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:18,102
- I know, it's all gone.
- Let's get something to eat.

352
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,038
Let's get some milk.

353
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:23,175
What the...?

354
00:22:25,175 --> 00:22:27,345
I just bought two containers
of milk.

355
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,446
Who drank it all?

356
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:34,117
Hello, we are the Ghost
Brothers, here to investigate.

357
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:40,523
It is so thick in here, dude.
So many ghosts in the air!

358
00:22:40,524 --> 00:22:43,758
I know what you mean. It's like
we're breathing in ghosts.

359
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:46,228
Dude, I am choking on a ghost
right now.

360
00:22:46,229 --> 00:22:48,197
- I am choking on a ghost.
- Spit that ghost out.

361
00:22:48,198 --> 00:22:50,032
Spit that ghost out right now.

362
00:22:50,033 --> 00:22:52,303
Spit it out! I'll punch it out
if you want!

363
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,603
Guys!

364
00:22:53,604 --> 00:22:56,038
You guys are professionals,
right?

365
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:59,409
Yeah, 100 percent.
We even have business cards.

366
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,444
Call me the middle man.
There you go. Super legit.

367
00:23:02,445 --> 00:23:05,146
Call us because we're always
open. Daily.

368
00:23:05,147 --> 00:23:08,284
- Did you hear that?
- That TV just turned on!

369
00:23:08,285 --> 00:23:10,452
- We're gonna die.
- Here we go, let's go.

370
00:23:10,453 --> 00:23:13,089
Rack them up, dude. This is
what we've been training for.

371
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,790
Uh...

372
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:16,393
I turned it on.

373
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:20,162
- She turned it on.
- So...

374
00:23:20,163 --> 00:23:22,404
- She's possessed by ghosts!
- She's possessed by ghosts!

375
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,941
Oh, my Lord! I am a...

376
00:23:31,942 --> 00:23:33,309
Oh, my God.

377
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,110
These ghost readings
are off the charts.

378
00:23:35,111 --> 00:23:37,746
Dude, there are 57 ghosts
in that bathroom over there.

379
00:23:37,747 --> 00:23:39,150
- What?
- Three in my pee stream.

380
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,517
Off the record.

381
00:23:40,518 --> 00:23:42,252
Where are you getting
these numbers from?

382
00:23:43,587 --> 00:23:45,323
A ghost was just born
in my hand.

383
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:48,258
- What do we do?
- Flamboyant scream?

384
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:49,192
Uh, duh.

385
00:23:50,627 --> 00:23:52,295
Stop it! Stop!

386
00:23:52,296 --> 00:23:58,133
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

387
00:23:58,134 --> 00:24:02,137
Seriously? This is what
you brought into our house?

388
00:24:02,138 --> 00:24:05,274
All right, so we found about 70
ghosts in your house total.

389
00:24:05,275 --> 00:24:07,109
Fifty-five up there
in your bedroom.

390
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:10,548
Also, it's our day off,
so we charge double for that.

391
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:14,049
So, whatever you guys
think is fair.

392
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,052
So basically, free?

393
00:24:16,053 --> 00:24:19,823
I was thinking moreover,
like, $3.

394
00:24:19,824 --> 00:24:22,057
Fine, deal. Go.

395
00:24:22,058 --> 00:24:24,627
- Thank you so much.
- Hell, yeah.

396
00:24:24,628 --> 00:24:27,146
If you need us, we will be in our
van, watching the perimeters.

397
00:25:26,923 --> 00:25:29,593
A door doesn't wake you?
You deaf?

398
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,362
I knew I had to step up my game

399
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,069
or I'd get kicked out
of the house.

400
00:25:42,873 --> 00:25:46,576
I love the pool cleaners.
I love the pool cleaners.

401
00:25:46,577 --> 00:25:50,419
I love the pool cleaners.

402
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:57,787
Oh, do the left nut.

403
00:25:57,788 --> 00:25:59,788
Left nut.

404
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:02,234
Oh, my hair.

405
00:26:17,407 --> 00:26:20,981
<i>d There's something about
The way you do your thing d</i>

406
00:26:24,981 --> 00:26:27,654
<i>d I can't take
My eyes off you d</i>

407
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:38,099
- Liz, you have a visitor.
- What the...?

408
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:45,268
Good morning, young lady.

409
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:50,172
Hey. I was just
looking for my earring.

410
00:26:50,173 --> 00:26:51,144
There it is.

411
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:55,177
Who said you could come
to my room?

412
00:26:55,178 --> 00:26:57,312
Well, I apologize
for barging in.

413
00:26:57,313 --> 00:26:59,316
Your mother gave me permission.

414
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:02,685
Well, what if I didn't
want you to come up?

415
00:27:02,686 --> 00:27:07,524
I had a sneaking
suspicion you did.

416
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:09,392
And how's that?

417
00:27:09,393 --> 00:27:13,563
By the very way
you were staring at me.

418
00:27:13,564 --> 00:27:16,299
Say what? I wasn't staring
at you, dude.

419
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,535
I was writing in my journal.

420
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,343
Hm.

421
00:27:26,343 --> 00:27:29,913
Look, I don't know what
you want, but I'm really busy.

422
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:32,716
I was just about to pierce
my pancreas.

423
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:34,249
Mm-hm.

424
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:39,392
d I just came To say hello d

425
00:27:41,392 --> 00:27:44,259
- d Hello d
- d Hello d

426
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,063
Come to Abe.

427
00:27:50,034 --> 00:27:51,836
Oh, shit-burger.

428
00:27:52,836 --> 00:27:54,837
- What?
- Gotta go, babe.

429
00:27:54,838 --> 00:27:58,240
Getting the hairy eyeball
from my sweet slut.

430
00:27:58,241 --> 00:28:00,174
Yeah. Check you later, though.

431
00:28:00,175 --> 00:28:02,512
Can't wait to get inside
that oval office.

432
00:28:02,513 --> 00:28:04,847
- Ugh...
- Ah!

433
00:28:04,848 --> 00:28:05,915
Stay free.

434
00:28:07,017 --> 00:28:08,751
But wait!

435
00:28:08,752 --> 00:28:11,130
I didn't even get to show you
my Apple product placement!

436
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,864
Is this thing on?

437
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,297
- Hello, America!
- Hello, America!

438
00:28:23,298 --> 00:28:25,700
All right, we came here
expecting to find

439
00:28:25,701 --> 00:28:27,738
a bunch of ghosts,
and guess what?

440
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:30,272
We did.

441
00:28:30,273 --> 00:28:32,306
I didn't say any of that
just now.

442
00:28:32,307 --> 00:28:34,644
- You're possessed.
- Dude, kill me.

443
00:28:38,214 --> 00:28:41,217
- I'm trying, but I can't.
- Why?

444
00:28:41,218 --> 00:28:44,287
Because I'm possessed, too.

445
00:28:44,288 --> 00:28:47,124
- We're both possessed by ghosts!
- We're both possessed by ghosts!

446
00:29:01,672 --> 00:29:03,239
Yes, Miss Liz?

447
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,276
I thought maybe we could talk.

448
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:08,944
Come on in. Come on.

449
00:29:08,945 --> 00:29:10,913
Sit down.

450
00:29:10,914 --> 00:29:12,448
Oh, uh...

451
00:29:12,449 --> 00:29:15,419
Don't worry about that.
Felipe was just tanning.

452
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,461
Just some tanning.
There you go, sit down.

453
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,165
Oh! Heh, heh.

454
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:33,702
Don't worry, they don't bite.

455
00:29:33,703 --> 00:29:35,305
Ay-ay-ay.

456
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:38,874
So, what can I help you with?

457
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:40,677
It's about a boy.

458
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:43,212
Of course it is.

459
00:29:43,213 --> 00:29:45,715
His name is Abraham,
and I just don't know

460
00:29:45,716 --> 00:29:48,116
if I've already blown it
with him.

461
00:29:48,117 --> 00:29:52,557
I really like him.
I think about him all the time.

462
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:04,298
There are certain things
you can do to... How you say?

463
00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:05,469
To win him over.

464
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,502
Like what?

465
00:30:07,503 --> 00:30:10,973
It's called "Roofie and Bang."

466
00:30:10,974 --> 00:30:13,075
A "Roofie and Bang"?

467
00:30:13,076 --> 00:30:14,646
Mm-hm.

468
00:30:16,646 --> 00:30:20,182
Ah! Just put one of those
in his Amaretto Sours,

469
00:30:20,183 --> 00:30:22,049
and he's yours
for the rest of the night.

470
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,853
And the best thing is that
they wake up the next morning

471
00:30:24,854 --> 00:30:27,991
not knowing I stuck my cheese
between their crackers.

472
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:33,183
Ha, ha! It's fabulous.
Have fun.

473
00:30:54,183 --> 00:30:56,278
No.

474
00:33:11,755 --> 00:33:13,823
Poor little baby.

475
00:33:13,824 --> 00:33:16,826
Are you hungry?
Are you hungry, baby Jonah?

476
00:33:16,827 --> 00:33:18,428
Come here.

477
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:22,737
Oh, just kidding.

478
00:33:26,737 --> 00:33:28,259
Shh!

479
00:34:32,735 --> 00:34:34,362
Help me!

480
00:35:17,347 --> 00:35:20,952
Jesus Christ.
Dude, are you okay?

481
00:35:24,353 --> 00:35:26,855
What the hell
is this doing here?

482
00:35:26,856 --> 00:35:29,825
And who the hells are you?
You?

483
00:35:29,826 --> 00:35:31,993
I'm directing. We're...

484
00:35:31,994 --> 00:35:35,514
Ahh! Leave me alone!

485
00:36:04,027 --> 00:36:05,928
Oh, sweet Lord.

486
00:36:05,929 --> 00:36:07,330
Oh, my God.

487
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,899
Oh, my God.

488
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,175
Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no, no.

489
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:19,609
Oh, thank God.

490
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,443
If that thing had been left out
another hour,

491
00:36:21,444 --> 00:36:24,047
we would've had ourselves
a murky pool.

492
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,061
Hey, Felipe.

493
00:38:02,012 --> 00:38:05,047
Bam! Dutch oven, bitch.

494
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,226
<i>d Aw, baby d</i>

495
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,829
Oh, thank you, honey.

496
00:38:57,032 --> 00:38:59,368
Your nose is cold.

497
00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:02,171
Oh, baby, the eggroll.

498
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:04,739
Teeth, teeth, teeth.

499
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:08,762
Oh, you need a haircut.

500
00:39:25,762 --> 00:39:27,096
There's so much...

501
00:39:27,097 --> 00:39:29,404
Get it off me. Get it off me.

502
00:39:34,404 --> 00:39:36,439
Good morning, sweetheart.

503
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,274
- Hi.
- Hi.

504
00:39:39,275 --> 00:39:42,044
You know, I gotta tell you

505
00:39:42,045 --> 00:39:45,114
that was a really nice surprise
you gave me last night.

506
00:39:45,115 --> 00:39:46,614
Huh?

507
00:39:46,615 --> 00:39:48,384
I'm telling you, baby,

508
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:52,327
it's moments like those that
make this marriage so exciting.

509
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:02,766
What? This...

510
00:40:11,474 --> 00:40:12,976
You want to mess with me?

511
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:16,479
You've messed with
the wrong person, jerk-off.

512
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,580
Aaron, what are you doing?

513
00:40:18,581 --> 00:40:20,447
Dana,
they have crossed the line,

514
00:40:20,448 --> 00:40:22,952
and I am not taking
their crap anymore.

515
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,419
Sweetheart, please.

516
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,822
I think if we just lay low

517
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:30,259
and we don't interact,
they'll go away.

518
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:33,428
Yeah.

519
00:40:33,429 --> 00:40:35,163
Okay.

520
00:40:35,164 --> 00:40:36,697
- Okay, fine.
- Okay. All right.

521
00:40:36,698 --> 00:40:37,965
I'm giving it one week.

522
00:40:37,966 --> 00:40:39,001
- That's it.
- Okay.

523
00:40:39,002 --> 00:40:40,803
- Got it?
- Yes.

524
00:40:40,804 --> 00:40:43,104
I've got a big interview and I
am not gonna have it screwed up

525
00:40:43,105 --> 00:40:45,675
- by a bunch of ghosts.
- I understa...

526
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:48,176
Sweetie, we have to go.

527
00:40:48,177 --> 00:40:50,345
We have to run those illegals
across the border.

528
00:40:50,346 --> 00:40:52,282
- Oh, my God. Is it noon already?
- Baby, yeah.

529
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,549
Go, go.

530
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:56,152
Illegals don't keep in the heat,
sweetie.

531
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:46,773
<i>He maintains a strict
plant-based diet.</i>

532
00:41:56,045 --> 00:41:58,614
<i>Beat an egg white. I made it
faster than the machine.</i>

533
00:41:59,748 --> 00:42:01,550
<i>- Over the counter.
- Yes.</i>

534
00:42:01,551 --> 00:42:06,032
<i>- Yes.
- One, two, three, go.</i>

535
00:42:41,056 --> 00:42:42,458
<i>Oh, yeah, baby.</i>

536
00:42:44,327 --> 00:42:47,731
Oh, that's right. Oh, that sort
of feels... Feels so good.

537
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:50,332
So smooth.
You're a dirty little one.

538
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:54,069
You're a dirty little minx.
Oh, you... Oh! Oh! Oh!

539
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,804
Look at it. Look at it. Oh!

540
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:04,412
And you thought we couldn't fit
20 of them into one van.

541
00:43:04,413 --> 00:43:06,682
Well, once again, honey,
you were right.

542
00:43:06,683 --> 00:43:09,119
Thank you, sweetie.

543
00:43:12,088 --> 00:43:13,822
Honey,
do you smell something burning?

544
00:43:13,823 --> 00:43:17,091
No.

545
00:43:17,092 --> 00:43:19,304
Something's burning.

546
00:43:29,304 --> 00:43:31,983
Ectoplasm.

547
00:43:39,983 --> 00:43:42,788
Son of a bitch!

548
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,954
Aaron, you're wasting all of it.

549
00:43:46,955 --> 00:43:49,724
Don't worry, honey. It's only
the cheap stuff from Tijuana.

550
00:43:49,725 --> 00:43:52,360
I just don't get
what this is gonna prove.

551
00:43:52,361 --> 00:43:55,630
It's gonna prove that we're not
going out of our minds.

552
00:43:55,631 --> 00:43:58,400
If anyone or anything
is coming into this room,

553
00:43:58,401 --> 00:44:02,909
we'll have a clear idea
of what we are dealing with.

554
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:07,867
Whoo!

555
00:44:35,237 --> 00:44:37,339
What was that?

556
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,612
Holy sweet nuts.

557
00:44:43,612 --> 00:44:46,349
Sweet potato pancakes,
would you look at that?

558
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,116
It's scary.

559
00:44:48,117 --> 00:44:50,585
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

560
00:44:50,586 --> 00:44:52,222
- So scary.
- Don't get too...

561
00:44:52,223 --> 00:44:54,122
Oh, look.

562
00:44:54,123 --> 00:44:58,761
Oh, honey, he's just
a witty-bitty thing.

563
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:02,598
Oh, it's so cute.

564
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,867
Oh, no. I knew it, honey.
He's a baller.

565
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,301
- Oh, no.
- It's okay.

566
00:45:07,302 --> 00:45:09,606
You know what they say
about big feet.

567
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:13,107
- Don't worry, baby.
- Don't wo... Huh.

568
00:45:13,108 --> 00:45:14,408
They end here.

569
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:16,245
This is weird.

570
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:18,380
- Oh, my God.
- Did you leave that open?

571
00:45:18,381 --> 00:45:21,116
What, the...? Oh.

572
00:45:21,117 --> 00:45:22,384
No.

573
00:45:22,385 --> 00:45:24,733
Oh, we are so fucked.

574
00:45:37,733 --> 00:45:40,570
I'm the raccoon
that snuck into your attic.

575
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,937
Scratchy scratchy.

576
00:45:41,938 --> 00:45:45,239
Now your power bill's
through the roof.

577
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,909
If you got home insurance
where you got car insurance,

578
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:50,579
then you're gonna have to pay
for this all by yourself.

579
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,980
So get Upstate.
You'll save money

580
00:45:52,981 --> 00:45:56,786
and be better protected
from mayhem like me.

581
00:46:00,356 --> 00:46:03,657
Okay, ducky, so you wanna give
him his baba in half an hour

582
00:46:03,658 --> 00:46:06,429
and give him the soy formula
because he's had a lot...

583
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,430
Bitch, I got it covered.

584
00:46:09,431 --> 00:46:12,501
- Get the hell out.
- Okay. Bye, now, sweetie.

585
00:46:12,502 --> 00:46:15,770
Okay. Okay. Oh.
And we're shoving now.

586
00:46:15,771 --> 00:46:17,340
That's good.

587
00:46:19,708 --> 00:46:22,512
- He's okay. He'll walk it off.
- Just go.

588
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:25,849
- I got you. It's okay.
- Bye, buddy.

589
00:46:26,849 --> 00:46:31,168
You smell like a dumpster. Yeah.

590
00:46:51,807 --> 00:46:53,684
My bad.

591
00:47:02,684 --> 00:47:06,321
Dude, seriously?

592
00:47:06,322 --> 00:47:08,757
Dude,
they dropped me all the time.

593
00:47:08,758 --> 00:47:11,927
Look how good I turned out.

594
00:47:29,244 --> 00:47:30,945
<i>The Tasmanian monkey is not one</i>

595
00:47:30,946 --> 00:47:33,447
<i>to shy away from
a good ass-humping.</i>

596
00:47:33,448 --> 00:47:36,349
<i>With its muscular hind legs
and powerful thrusts</i>

597
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:38,351
<i>that can pull a 1-ton truck...</i>

598
00:47:38,353 --> 00:47:40,529
<i>...this rare species is...</i>

599
00:47:46,529 --> 00:47:49,565
Sorry to barge in. I just locked
myself out of the house.

600
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:52,976
- Can I use your phone?
- Yeah.

601
00:47:59,976 --> 00:48:02,611
You mind
if I take my pants off?

602
00:48:02,612 --> 00:48:06,314
Uh... No.

603
00:48:06,315 --> 00:48:08,316
You mind if I
deep French kiss you

604
00:48:08,317 --> 00:48:11,054
while I fondle
your 12-year-old boy ass?

605
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:13,427
Okay.

606
00:48:21,563 --> 00:48:25,467
My name is Alice, and
this is my world.

607
00:48:44,253 --> 00:48:46,454
Shit! You guys gotta
get out of here.

608
00:48:46,455 --> 00:48:47,990
But we just got started.

609
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:50,764
- I don't care! Get out!
- Okay!

610
00:48:54,764 --> 00:48:57,933
Guess we'll just have
to do each other.

611
00:48:57,934 --> 00:49:00,938
Leave.

612
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:04,805
Well, hello.

613
00:49:04,806 --> 00:49:09,944
Maybe your friends would care
to stay for a libation?

614
00:49:09,945 --> 00:49:12,647
Or two.

615
00:49:12,648 --> 00:49:14,217
Uh, no.

616
00:49:15,818 --> 00:49:19,620
<i>d Baby d</i>

617
00:49:19,621 --> 00:49:22,457
<i>d Mm, you and I
Belong together d</i>

618
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:24,326
You know,

619
00:49:24,327 --> 00:49:30,232
I greatly apologize
for intruding upon your privacy.

620
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:33,134
- Not at all. Sit down.
- Oh.

621
00:49:33,135 --> 00:49:36,504
Can I get you
something to drink?

622
00:49:36,505 --> 00:49:38,707
Amaretto Sour?

623
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:41,710
No, I don't think that'll
be nece... Oh, why, thank you.

624
00:49:41,711 --> 00:49:45,147
- Is that John Wilkes Booth?
- Where?

625
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,349
- My mistake.
- I hate that guy.

626
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:49,051
Me too.

627
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:52,487
Anyways, I'm glad you're here.

628
00:49:52,488 --> 00:49:54,522
As am I.

629
00:49:54,523 --> 00:49:57,325
You look thirsty.

630
00:49:57,326 --> 00:49:59,393
Drink, drink, drink.

631
00:49:59,394 --> 00:50:02,596
All the way.

632
00:50:02,597 --> 00:50:05,369
Good boy.

633
00:50:06,369 --> 00:50:08,371
Come to Abe.

634
00:50:09,371 --> 00:50:10,739
Oh, yeah.

635
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:16,713
I'm Abe Lincoln.

636
00:50:17,713 --> 00:50:19,849
Wow, you know,
I am feeling a little sleepy.

637
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,249
Don't fight it.

638
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:23,050
I want you to show me
the Lincoln Monument.

639
00:50:23,051 --> 00:50:25,052
Yeah, I want you
to go to the South.

640
00:50:25,053 --> 00:50:26,420
Yeah, take me to the South.

641
00:50:26,421 --> 00:50:28,389
You wanna see
the Lincoln Monument?

642
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:29,425
Show it to me. Mm.

643
00:50:36,132 --> 00:50:39,968
Sorry, bitch. He's mine.

644
00:50:39,969 --> 00:50:41,602
What in tarnation?

645
00:50:41,603 --> 00:50:44,473
You're in good hands now, papi.

646
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:49,377
Felipe was the one who created
the Roofie and Bang.

647
00:50:49,378 --> 00:50:52,413
Hey! Let me out!

648
00:50:52,414 --> 00:50:56,423
I want to free
your penis slaves.

649
00:51:01,423 --> 00:51:03,892
Rats!

650
00:51:03,893 --> 00:51:07,095
Oh. Your nipples, mm,

651
00:51:07,096 --> 00:51:09,239
they taste like copper pennies.

652
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:20,510
I'd like to invite you
to the Teabag Party.

653
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,180
Abraham?

654
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:27,582
Abraham!

655
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:31,021
Help me! Help me! Help me!

656
00:51:32,021 --> 00:51:34,956
Abe Lincoln's getting teabagged!

657
00:51:39,094 --> 00:51:41,429
No, stop it!

658
00:51:42,864 --> 00:51:44,800
Take this,
you dragon tattooed slut!

659
00:52:03,351 --> 00:52:05,391
Abraham.

660
00:52:09,391 --> 00:52:11,362
Abraham.

661
00:52:14,362 --> 00:52:16,134
Abraham?

662
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:19,701
Abraham.

663
00:52:19,702 --> 00:52:21,306
Abraham!

664
00:52:24,306 --> 00:52:26,674
Let me in!

665
00:52:26,675 --> 00:52:30,485
Let me in!

666
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:25,433
Mom, Dad, it's me, Jonah.

667
00:53:25,434 --> 00:53:27,435
Where do I start?

668
00:53:27,436 --> 00:53:29,936
It was just supposed to be
for one night.

669
00:53:29,937 --> 00:53:31,539
I wanted to be cool, you know?

670
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:35,709
I wanted to be more than just
a baby in the crib.

671
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:38,880
And then things got a little
out of control.

672
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:54,828
Excuse me! Excuse me, please!

673
00:53:54,829 --> 00:53:57,765
You're all gonna have
to shut this down

674
00:53:57,766 --> 00:54:00,251
or I'm gonna have
to call the cops.

675
00:54:16,251 --> 00:54:18,452
It's about time we had
a proper date night.

676
00:54:18,453 --> 00:54:20,454
Well, it was a wonderful night.

677
00:54:20,455 --> 00:54:22,490
I'll tell you what
I am excited about.

678
00:54:22,491 --> 00:54:25,359
Having a chocolate muffin
for dessert.

679
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,761
That is for tomorrow,
young man.

680
00:54:27,762 --> 00:54:32,366
Wow.
Honey, there's no mess.

681
00:54:32,367 --> 00:54:33,403
I'm so impressed.

682
00:54:34,003 --> 00:54:36,704
I told you, Liz is responsible
to handle all of this.

683
00:54:36,705 --> 00:54:38,708
You know, once again
you were right.

684
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:40,311
Thank you, dear.

685
00:54:43,311 --> 00:54:45,882
Shh, shh.

686
00:54:46,882 --> 00:54:49,722
Hey, Jonah.

687
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:55,371
Is that a wine cooler?

688
00:55:11,507 --> 00:55:14,010
<i>Ooh! Look at that.
Honey Badger don't give a shit.</i>

689
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:17,480
<i>He'll just run through your
bedroom while you're sleeping.</i>

690
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:19,983
<i>Honey Badger don't care.</i>

691
00:55:35,931 --> 00:55:37,871
It's not even fun anymore.

692
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:46,741
Honey?

693
00:55:46,742 --> 00:55:49,779
- Honey, wake up.
- I already gave you a handy.

694
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,846
Did you hear that?

695
00:55:51,847 --> 00:55:54,288
Something downstairs.

696
00:55:59,288 --> 00:56:03,457
No, no, no, no, no, no.

697
00:56:03,458 --> 00:56:05,233
Damn it, no.

698
00:56:12,233 --> 00:56:13,801
Oh, my God.

699
00:56:13,802 --> 00:56:15,636
No!

700
00:56:15,637 --> 00:56:17,272
Sweetie!

701
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:20,707
- Damn it.
- What is it?

702
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:23,645
Someone ate
my chocolate muffin.

703
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:24,947
Yeah.

704
00:56:27,048 --> 00:56:28,387
Babe?

705
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:33,425
Oh, my God.

706
00:56:36,425 --> 00:56:39,400
Oh,
that's seven years bad luck.

707
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,403
They swapped out
all the family photos.

708
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:51,105
I gotta document this.

709
00:56:51,106 --> 00:56:52,573
Oh.

710
00:56:52,574 --> 00:56:54,911
Honey?

711
00:56:55,911 --> 00:56:58,078
Something's breathing on me.

712
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,482
And it smells like
chocolate muffin.

713
00:57:01,483 --> 00:57:03,484
Wow.

714
00:57:03,485 --> 00:57:07,153
A lot of them look like they're
from the turn of the century.

715
00:57:07,154 --> 00:57:08,626
And now it's feeling me up.

716
00:57:10,626 --> 00:57:12,926
- Oh.
- Ooh!

717
00:57:12,927 --> 00:57:14,293
Who's a naughty ghost?

718
00:57:14,294 --> 00:57:15,963
Wow, baby,
you gotta look at this.

719
00:57:15,964 --> 00:57:18,532
The ghost's great
grandfather's ghost

720
00:57:18,533 --> 00:57:20,534
is in a picture
with President Roosevelt.

721
00:57:20,535 --> 00:57:22,202
Oh, yeah, you're a bad ghost!

722
00:57:22,203 --> 00:57:24,139
Do it to me
like it's paranormal!

723
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,640
Looks like Hitler's ghost
is here.

724
00:57:26,641 --> 00:57:29,476
Yeah! Yeah, fuck me
like you don't know me!

725
00:57:29,477 --> 00:57:31,612
Oh, God,
you're such a big ghost!

726
00:57:31,613 --> 00:57:34,724
- God, I love poltergeists! Yeah!
- Right, right, right.

727
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:44,658
Okay.

728
00:57:44,659 --> 00:57:46,361
Whoa!

729
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:48,697
Close the door! Close the door!
Close it!

730
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:50,802
Sorry.

731
00:57:53,802 --> 00:57:57,138
- Hello. Hi. Come on in.
- Hi.

732
00:57:57,139 --> 00:57:58,706
We weren't expecting visitors.

733
00:57:58,707 --> 00:58:00,475
Oh, no, that's okay.

734
00:58:00,476 --> 00:58:03,075
- It's small, but we get by.
- Didn't mean to intrude.

735
00:58:03,076 --> 00:58:05,177
Sit down,
welcome to our humble abode.

736
00:58:05,178 --> 00:58:06,882
- Welcome.
- We know it's not much.

737
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:10,817
Hey, what you guys saw
back there, totally nothing.

738
00:58:10,818 --> 00:58:13,320
- Hey, we're not here to judge.
- Yeah, no.

739
00:58:13,321 --> 00:58:15,488
- That was actually science, okay?
- Yeah.

740
00:58:15,489 --> 00:58:17,393
We can't really get into it
because it's...

741
00:58:17,394 --> 00:58:20,261
- Guys, it's fine.
- It's fine. Listen.

742
00:58:20,262 --> 00:58:23,263
Things are getting worse
at the house.

743
00:58:23,264 --> 00:58:27,569
Um, hey, uh, why are you filming
all of this?

744
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:30,436
I just feel the need
to record everything.

745
00:58:30,437 --> 00:58:32,572
- Good call.
- Yeah, good call, my man.

746
00:58:32,573 --> 00:58:34,206
We actually do the same thing.

747
00:58:34,207 --> 00:58:35,541
- Camera twins.
- Let's go.

748
00:58:35,542 --> 00:58:37,209
- Okay, look, guys,
- Okay.

749
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:39,514
We really,
really need your help.

750
00:58:39,515 --> 00:58:41,616
All right. Step number one.

751
00:58:41,617 --> 00:58:45,284
You gotta hire yourself
a Hispanic gay manny, all right?

752
00:58:45,285 --> 00:58:47,920
But he's not gonna do
any of his chores.

753
00:58:47,921 --> 00:58:49,590
Instead, this is the kicker.

754
00:58:49,591 --> 00:58:51,124
Here's the kicker.
I love this part.

755
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:53,559
This is great. He's gonna be
up in his room

756
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,095
all day with some secret lover

757
00:58:55,096 --> 00:58:58,067
that nobody really knows
or understands at all.

758
00:58:58,068 --> 00:59:01,069
I'm sorry.
Are you frigging kidding me?

759
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:03,770
What, effing?

760
00:59:03,771 --> 00:59:06,540
You've just described
our manny Felipe.

761
00:59:06,541 --> 00:59:08,108
- Great. Awesome.
- All right.

762
00:59:08,109 --> 00:59:10,242
I'll check that one off.
Moving on.

763
00:59:10,243 --> 00:59:12,211
- All right, here we go.
- Number two.

764
00:59:12,212 --> 00:59:14,280
You're gonna have to do
a very bad job

765
00:59:14,281 --> 00:59:16,383
at raising a teenage girl, okay?

766
00:59:16,384 --> 00:59:18,985
That way she can have a very
rebellious phase in her teens.

767
00:59:18,986 --> 00:59:21,420
I'm talking tattoos.
I'm talking piercings.

768
00:59:21,421 --> 00:59:24,559
I'm talking things to do
with dragons. You get my drift?

769
00:59:26,394 --> 00:59:27,895
You guys? Okay.

770
00:59:27,896 --> 00:59:29,563
Great.
You guys already have that.

771
00:59:29,564 --> 00:59:31,831
Here's number three.
Aaron, this is just for you.

772
00:59:31,832 --> 00:59:34,936
All you gotta do is stumble upon
two naked dudes in their van.

773
00:59:34,937 --> 00:59:38,670
That's it.
That's all there is to it.

774
01:00:10,606 --> 01:00:12,506
Aaron! Aaron!

775
01:00:12,507 --> 01:00:15,375
No, no!

776
01:00:15,376 --> 01:00:17,112
Aaron!

777
01:00:18,112 --> 01:00:19,547
No.

778
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:58,829
Fuck. I forgot the crisps.

779
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:10,201
Oh, good morning.

780
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:15,203
How long have you been up?
Honey?

781
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:18,507
You okay? Hello?

782
01:01:19,507 --> 01:01:21,442
Dana?

783
01:01:21,443 --> 01:01:25,751
Dana. Honey, talk to me.
What are you...?

784
01:01:31,753 --> 01:01:33,754
Holy mother of cotton.

785
01:01:33,755 --> 01:01:38,961
Dana. Baby?
Baby. Say some...

786
01:01:39,961 --> 01:01:43,196
"Get out of my house...

787
01:01:43,197 --> 01:01:46,702
...buttnuts"?

788
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:52,141
Hello?

789
01:01:53,141 --> 01:01:54,709
Hello, sir.

790
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:57,245
You wanna come here?

791
01:01:57,246 --> 01:02:01,281
No, no. That's fantastic, sir.
My house is your house.

792
01:02:01,282 --> 01:02:02,619
Bye-bye.

793
01:02:04,619 --> 01:02:07,489
Dana, that was the CEO
of the Umbrella Corporation.

794
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:11,591
He's coming here.
Isn't that great? Wha...?

795
01:02:11,592 --> 01:02:12,959
Oh, right.

796
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,729
I've gotta figure out

797
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:17,568
how to get you depossessed
before he gets here.

798
01:02:20,568 --> 01:02:22,570
But since you're
unconscious anyway...

799
01:02:22,571 --> 01:02:24,839
No.

800
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,108
Okay.

801
01:02:45,994 --> 01:02:48,462
Sluggy?

802
01:02:48,463 --> 01:02:51,166
Sluggy Kornnutz,
exorcism specialist.

803
01:03:03,612 --> 01:03:08,716
In the name of the Lord Jesus
Christ and all of his saviors,

804
01:03:08,717 --> 01:03:11,451
I command you, evict this body

805
01:03:11,452 --> 01:03:16,893
and return back to the bowels
of hell from whence you came.

806
01:03:17,893 --> 01:03:19,362
Defiant one.

807
01:03:21,362 --> 01:03:23,664
They hate this.

808
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:37,412
What? What? What?
What's going on?

809
01:03:38,012 --> 01:03:40,882
She's being possessed by
the deadliest of demons:

810
01:03:40,883 --> 01:03:42,683
Her inner demons.

811
01:03:42,684 --> 01:03:45,487
We all have them. We try to
fight them on a daily basis,

812
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:46,854
whether it's eating

813
01:03:46,855 --> 01:03:48,554
the last half-pint
of strawberry ice cream

814
01:03:48,555 --> 01:03:50,659
or shooting up
an armful of smack...

815
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,996
Sluggy. Please.

816
01:03:54,996 --> 01:03:56,363
Sorry.

817
01:03:56,364 --> 01:03:59,200
Time to bring out the big guns.

818
01:03:59,201 --> 01:04:02,535
- What are you doing?
- An intervention. Ahh!

819
01:04:02,536 --> 01:04:05,105
Stop, stop. Stop it.

820
01:04:05,106 --> 01:04:09,880
- What? What's wrong?
- You're not shooting my wife.

821
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:16,885
Suit yourself. We'll stick
with the chosen plan.

822
01:05:04,632 --> 01:05:08,570
Oh! I'm okay. I'm back.

823
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:12,175
- Mazel tov!
- Mazel tov!

824
01:05:19,014 --> 01:05:20,916
Ugh! Oh!

825
01:05:26,521 --> 01:05:30,124
You've got 20 minutes
to knock my socks off.

826
01:05:30,125 --> 01:05:34,369
But first, I need your bathroom.
I just sharted myself.

827
01:05:49,043 --> 01:05:51,347
Very impressed.

828
01:05:52,347 --> 01:05:55,150
- You've got everything covered.
- Thank you.

829
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:57,852
What do you know about
umbrellas?

830
01:05:57,853 --> 01:06:00,187
I'm sorry?

831
01:06:00,188 --> 01:06:04,529
What do you know about
umbrellas?

832
01:06:07,529 --> 01:06:09,567
You...

833
01:06:12,567 --> 01:06:14,237
...use them when it rains?

834
01:06:16,237 --> 01:06:17,041
Aaron,

835
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:20,307
you're hired.

836
01:06:22,143 --> 01:06:24,380
Oh, my God.

837
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:28,016
All right. Hi.
Oh, my God. Hey. Thanks, guys.

838
01:06:29,016 --> 01:06:30,584
All right, enough.

839
01:06:30,585 --> 01:06:33,088
Listen, I need to use
your bathroom again.

840
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:37,323
This time, not only did I shart,
but I peed myself too.

841
01:06:37,324 --> 01:06:38,329
Of course...

842
01:06:41,329 --> 01:06:44,330
You didn't pay
your electric bill?

843
01:06:44,331 --> 01:06:46,267
That's a loser move.

844
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:48,768
Winners pay their bills.

845
01:06:48,769 --> 01:06:50,170
No, no, no, I pay my bills.

846
01:06:50,171 --> 01:06:52,572
All the time.
I'm a winner. Ask anybody.

847
01:06:52,573 --> 01:06:54,740
There's a short.
There's a short in the breaker.

848
01:06:54,741 --> 01:06:56,108
It happens all the time.

849
01:06:56,109 --> 01:06:57,709
I know that
you've got a plane to catch,

850
01:06:57,710 --> 01:06:59,213
so why don't we
just go out and...?

851
01:07:01,349 --> 01:07:06,856
<i>Mm. Oh, thank you, honey.</i>

852
01:07:08,856 --> 01:07:11,027
I've done some
messed-up shit in my life,

853
01:07:12,027 --> 01:07:15,129
but that is insanity.

854
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:17,434
Aaron, you're fired.

855
01:07:19,434 --> 01:07:22,267
What...? Wait, wait, no, no, no.
I can explain. I can explain.

856
01:07:22,268 --> 01:07:25,371
Wait, sir. Sir. Right over here.
Look. Look in the closet. See?

857
01:07:25,372 --> 01:07:27,941
We've got three umbrell... Look.
Look, one of the umbrellas

858
01:07:27,942 --> 01:07:30,577
is already open
in case it rains in the house.

859
01:07:30,578 --> 01:07:32,311
Sir, just give me one more
chance, please.

860
01:07:32,312 --> 01:07:34,613
I'm gonna borrow your dog
for a few days.

861
01:07:34,614 --> 01:07:36,650
- I don't know if...
- Fantastic.

862
01:07:37,719 --> 01:07:39,886
<i>d Baby d</i>

863
01:07:39,887 --> 01:07:42,657
<i>d There's something about
The way you do your thing d</i>

864
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:46,231
Generic? Loser.

865
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:51,265
Damn it.

866
01:07:51,266 --> 01:07:53,567
Damn it! Shit!

867
01:07:53,568 --> 01:07:57,838
Yes. Now, that felt good.
Bloody good.

868
01:07:59,106 --> 01:08:01,609
So you think that's funny?

869
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:04,612
Why don't you come out and show
yourself, you son of a bitch?

870
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:06,480
Oh, you're so stupid.

871
01:08:06,481 --> 01:08:09,818
Yeah, sure, it's easy to haunt
people when you're invisible.

872
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:13,591
- Come out here, you wuss.
- I'm a ghost.

873
01:08:19,627 --> 01:08:23,197
- Holy shit.
- Calm down.

874
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:26,934
Now is not the time for fear.

875
01:08:26,935 --> 01:08:29,702
That comes later.

876
01:08:29,703 --> 01:08:31,705
What?

877
01:08:31,706 --> 01:08:35,643
Huh? I said, calm down.

878
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:40,550
Now is not the time for fear.
That comes later.

879
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:43,885
I'm sorry, I'm not getting it.

880
01:08:46,488 --> 01:08:48,656
You dumb-ass.

881
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:51,392
I said, calm down.

882
01:08:51,393 --> 01:08:54,661
Now is not the time for fear.

883
01:08:54,662 --> 01:08:56,197
That comes later.

884
01:08:56,198 --> 01:08:59,500
Oh, okay. No, no, no,
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

885
01:08:59,501 --> 01:09:02,814
Oh, shit. Oh, God. Ahh!

886
01:09:12,814 --> 01:09:16,519
What on earth
is going on down there?

887
01:09:17,519 --> 01:09:21,327
Honey, hi. You think
you could give me a hand?

888
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:29,666
Why is Manuel the Guatemalan
gardener shirtless?

889
01:09:31,666 --> 01:09:34,867
<i>All right. I got you now.</i>

890
01:09:34,868 --> 01:09:37,609
<i>Been waiting a long time.</i>

891
01:09:42,610 --> 01:09:45,746
- This is some good shit.
- The best.

892
01:09:45,747 --> 01:09:48,521
- Buttery, isn't it?
- Amazing.

893
01:09:54,521 --> 01:09:56,591
That's my cock.

894
01:09:57,591 --> 01:09:59,635
You'd think it would be
circumcised.

895
01:10:06,635 --> 01:10:09,136
This is the scary part.

896
01:10:11,573 --> 01:10:13,577
What the hell is going on?

897
01:10:15,577 --> 01:10:19,612
Welcome! Welcome to the 74th
Annual Hunger Games.

898
01:10:19,613 --> 01:10:23,651
May the odds be ever
in your favor.

899
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:27,090
Oh, for the love of God,
please have mercy!

900
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:31,760
I don't want my ass
to be branded!

901
01:10:56,751 --> 01:10:58,818
Oh, my God. Honey.

902
01:10:58,819 --> 01:11:00,622
It's the Ghost Brothers.

903
01:11:01,855 --> 01:11:04,491
Take that, douche bags!

904
01:11:04,492 --> 01:11:05,694
You saved our lives.

905
01:11:05,695 --> 01:11:08,829
Oh! Oh, thank you so much.

906
01:11:20,307 --> 01:11:22,679
Oh, yeah,
we're getting out of here.

907
01:11:24,679 --> 01:11:27,814
Oh! Oh, no.

908
01:11:27,815 --> 01:11:29,654
Oh, no, dude.

909
01:11:32,654 --> 01:11:34,321
Ohh!

910
01:11:34,322 --> 01:11:35,688
Abe Lincoln, bro.

911
01:11:35,689 --> 01:11:39,193
Hey, hey, hey, Abraham Lincoln!

912
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:40,395
What are you doing?

913
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:42,729
Killing ghost hunters.

914
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:44,363
But you're a vampire slayer.

915
01:11:44,364 --> 01:11:47,735
Yeah, well, getting tea-bagged
by a ghost changes a man.

916
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:51,071
Oh, my God!

917
01:11:51,072 --> 01:11:52,538
Ow!

918
01:11:52,539 --> 01:11:55,341
No, no, no!
Please, don't! Don't!

919
01:11:55,342 --> 01:11:56,977
Die, you son of a bitch.

920
01:11:56,978 --> 01:11:59,380
- Oh!
- Die!

921
01:11:59,381 --> 01:12:02,683
Abe Lincoln's getting Tased.

922
01:12:02,684 --> 01:12:05,688
Leave my dad alone, bitch.

923
01:12:06,688 --> 01:12:08,554
- Liz?
- Honey.

924
01:12:08,555 --> 01:12:10,758
Honey, you look great.

925
01:12:10,759 --> 01:12:12,559
What happened to you?

926
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,263
Guys, I'm so sorry
for being the rebellious,

927
01:12:16,264 --> 01:12:18,500
skanky, slutty teenager
for so long.

928
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:21,033
You two deserve
better than that.

929
01:12:21,034 --> 01:12:23,201
You've been
the most amazing parents,

930
01:12:23,202 --> 01:12:24,736
and I love you both so much.

931
01:12:24,737 --> 01:12:26,906
- Oh, honey. We love you.
- We love you.

932
01:12:26,907 --> 01:12:29,944
Ah. Ow, ow. That's an ax.
That's an ax in my arm.

933
01:12:29,945 --> 01:12:32,712
There is one more bit
of exciting news.

934
01:12:32,713 --> 01:12:34,914
- You got off the meth?
- Your herpes cleared up?

935
01:12:34,915 --> 01:12:36,850
You're not a lesbian anymore?

936
01:12:36,851 --> 01:12:39,252
No. I met
the most amazing guy,

937
01:12:39,253 --> 01:12:41,055
and he's brought
so much positivity

938
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:43,389
to my life on so many levels.

939
01:12:43,390 --> 01:12:47,395
Mom and Dad,
meet my new boyfriend Otto.

940
01:12:50,765 --> 01:12:52,470
Isn't he the sweetest?

941
01:12:55,470 --> 01:12:57,039
Does Otto have
a five-year plan?

942
01:12:59,039 --> 01:13:00,640
Uh, he's Jewish.

943
01:13:00,641 --> 01:13:04,426
- Oh, I love Jews.
- That's a good plan. I like it.

944
01:13:18,426 --> 01:13:22,062
<i>I stood face to face
and fought off an attack,</i>

945
01:13:22,063 --> 01:13:24,832
<i>and I know that you want
all of the facts.</i>

946
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:28,805
<i>So stick a fin in your ear
and dig out the wax!</i>

947
01:13:37,612 --> 01:13:40,781
- Oh...
- Felipe!

948
01:13:40,782 --> 01:13:42,916
I'm just kidding!

949
01:13:42,917 --> 01:13:46,819
<i>The cameras they had taped
and the mouse was afraid</i>

950
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:49,188
<i>that his ass would get laid.</i>

951
01:13:49,189 --> 01:13:52,426
<i>If my ass would get laid!</i>

952
01:13:58,632 --> 01:14:00,800
- Hey, gang!
- Dad?

953
01:14:00,801 --> 01:14:02,469
I know, I know.

954
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:04,303
Yeah, I got kicked
out of the hospital

955
01:14:04,304 --> 01:14:06,472
for lewd misconduct,
whatever that means.

956
01:14:06,473 --> 01:14:08,141
So I thought I'd stay with you.

957
01:14:08,142 --> 01:14:10,176
Oh, no, we don't have the...

958
01:14:10,177 --> 01:14:12,479
Cool. Come in, ladies.
We got company.

959
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,715
Awesome. Discount whores.

960
01:14:14,716 --> 01:14:16,148
The best.

961
01:14:16,149 --> 01:14:18,986
This is, uh, uh, uh...

962
01:14:18,987 --> 01:14:20,487
Bah!

963
01:14:20,488 --> 01:14:22,222
Okay, well, if you need me,

964
01:14:22,223 --> 01:14:25,526
I will be upstairs
doing the Jamaican Donut.

965
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:28,728
Yeah. It's like yoga,
except it's stinky.

966
01:14:28,729 --> 01:14:30,662
Then we'll do
a Pittsburgh Platter,

967
01:14:30,663 --> 01:14:32,667
Cleveland Steamer.
We'll mix it up.

968
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:34,800
So that was your real father?

969
01:14:34,801 --> 01:14:36,870
Yeah.

970
01:14:36,871 --> 01:14:38,839
I like him.

971
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,578
I like him a lot.

972
01:14:43,578 --> 01:14:45,311
Are you effing kidding me?

973
01:14:45,312 --> 01:14:47,812
This is the biggest piece
of crap video I've ever seen.

974
01:14:47,813 --> 01:14:49,917
I know. We aren't
getting squat for it.

975
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:51,751
I don't know.

976
01:14:51,752 --> 01:14:56,489
Well, I thought it was
pretty damn good.

977
01:14:56,490 --> 01:14:59,825
Could one of you be a dove and
get me another tub of popcorn?

978
01:14:59,826 --> 01:15:03,430
Extra butter, please,
with a splash of patchouli oil?
