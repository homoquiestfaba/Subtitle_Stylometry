please go now?</i>

711

And then?

712
00:52:53,404 --> 00:52:55,771
From London,
back to Luxembourg,

713
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,552
then Czech Republic,
and now we're here.

714
00:52:58,576 --> 00:53:00,442
And everywhere you went,
you paid with cash?

715
00:53:01,279 --> 00:53:02,945
You must admit
that's not common.

716
00:53:03,314 --> 00:53:05,481

companies charge in fees?

00:53:19,931 --> 00:53:21,363

725
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,764
Everything
they say checks out.

726
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:50,993
Sylvia and Mac Randolph, 22
and 19, reside in Los Angeles.

727
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,907
They have proof
of being in places far away

728
00:53:53,931 --> 00:53:55,809
from when and where
the crimes took place.

729
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:58,378
They could've stopped in Paris
on their way from Madrid.

730
00:53:58,402 --> 00:53:59,479
But we can't
prove it.

731
00:53:59,503 --> 00:54:01,515
Well, hold them
until we can.

732
00:54:01,539 --> 00:54:03,906
But why would they go to London,
where passports are required,

733
00:54:04,342 --> 00:54:05,686
or book a hotel
like the Six,

734
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:07,287

under the radar?

I had this case once.

753
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:59,373
The beautiful daughter of
the most celebrated architect

754
00:54:59,397 --> 00:55:03,377
in Germany, beaten to death.

755
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:05,679
Her father hunted down
the guy who did it

756
00:55:05,703 --> 00:55:07,336
and shot him 12 times.

757
00:55:09,373 --> 00:55:11,874
Later, after the whole
thing calmed down,

758
00:55:12,943 --> 00:55:14,443
he shot himself.

00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:33,028

every time I close my eyes,

763
00:55:33,864 --> 00:55:35,764
the image
that I see

764
00:55:36,467 --> 00:55:38,901
is my daughter
laying on a cold slab.

765
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:41,470
And that's never
gonna go away.

766
00:55:48,346 --> 00:55:49,545

you might.

Does the name Simon Haysmith
mean anything to you?

789
00:57:21,872 --> 00:57:23,550

who defrauded some of

790

the richest men on Wall Street

791
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:25,819
for, like, 300 million?

792
00:57:25,843 --> 00:57:27,370
Yeah, that's him. Yeah.

793
00:57:27,394 --> 00:57:28,922
The Feds spent a fortune in
taxpayer dollars

794
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:30,857
preparing to prosecute him.

795
00:57:30,881 --> 00:57:32,692
They didn't have
the case they wanted,

796
00:57:32,716 --> 00:57:34,550
so they squeezed his employees,
his accountants, attorneys...

797
00:57:35,085 --> 00:57:36,963
But none of them
said anything, so,

798

criminals in history

799
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,189

He kind of
went quiet.

but it didn't make any sense.

Not then, at least.
What do you mean?

932
01:07:20,604 --> 01:07:24,450
Well, Simon Sr was on two
boards with my husband,

933
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:27,175
a big philanthropist and an
active member of the church.

934
01:07:27,411 --> 01:07:29,689
His wife, Irina, was
a stay-at-home mom.

935
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:31,524
Oh, she was beautiful.

936
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:33,593
She looked a bit like
Melania Trump,

937
01:07:33,617 --> 01:07:35,316
with those big
Slavic eyes.

938
01:07:35,585 --> 01:07:38,620
She used to be a model, I
think, from Russia originally.

you most definitely should.

Thank you.

943
01:07:50,467 --> 01:07:52,267
She loved to bake pies.

944
01:07:52,436 --> 01:07:55,437
Around Thanksgiving, she would
bake five different kinds.

945
01:07:56,106 --> 01:07:57,639
They seemed to be
the perfect couple.

946
01:07:59,076 --> 01:08:00,553
And then
she killed herself.

947
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:03,411
Oh, my God. How?

948
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,747

Oh, "kids." Simon...

950
01:08:08,151 --> 01:08:09,651
Simon had
an older sister, Marina.

951
01:08:09,786 --> 01:08:11,086
Ah.

952
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:14,656
Their father
was so strict,

953
01:08:15,292 --> 01:08:17,202
the kids were always,

954
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:19,138
"Yes, please" and
"Thank you, ma'am."

955
01:08:19,162 --> 01:08:21,262
He pushed them to be
the best at everything,

956
01:08:21,498 --> 01:08:25,100
forever dragging them to
some art exhibition or lecture.

957
01:08:25,469 --> 01:08:27,302
Didn't seem to
want them to have any fun.

958
01:08:27,504 --> 01:08:29,270
Never, ever
went on holidays.

959
01:08:30,407 --> 01:08:33,341
One time, Marina dripped
ice cream on her top.

960
01:08:33,844 --> 01:08:35,877
And Simon Sr
took her inside the house.

961
01:08:36,847 --> 01:08:39,247
And when they came out,
she wouldn't speak,

962
01:08:39,749 --> 01:08:41,149
wouldn't say a word.

963
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:43,751

what happened?

964
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:48,668
I found out later, he
had beaten her so hard,

965
01:08:48,692 --> 01:08:51,471
she had welts on
her backside.

966
01:08:51,495 --> 01:08:52,861
My neighbour
was cruel...

967
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:55,208
He demanded perfection
from his family,

968
01:08:55,232 --> 01:08:57,143
especially his children,

969
01:08:57,167 --> 01:08:59,212
and if they didn't achieve
his high standards immediately,

970
01:08:59,236 --> 01:09:00,802
he would
whip it out of them.

971
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,872
I told my husband
I had suspicions,

972
01:09:05,175 --> 01:09:06,886
but he just told me
to mind my own business.

973

where they are now?

left for boarding school,

you might be able to help me.

So, Marina gets sent away
to boarding school,

1069
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:49,817

nothing to get her back.

1070

Valerie said that Haysmith
called Marina "a devious bitch",

1075
01:15:05,568 --> 01:15:06,679
but he also said
something about

young girls,

1077
01:15:09,272 --> 01:15:11,906

it cruel and ugly.

1093
01:16:05,628 --> 01:16:07,762

1094

They are angry at the world
for not accepting them.

1113

were exact and purposeful,
