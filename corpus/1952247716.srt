00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:59,580
#

2
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,610
And cut!

3
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,368
[knock on door]

4
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,145
#

5
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,558
Passport.

6
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,529
Put you right hand
on the glass.

7
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,557
Stand still for the photo.

8
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:30,003
Jérome Beaunez?.

9
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,168
Yes.

10
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,539
Business or pleasure?.

11
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,446
Business or pleasure?.

12
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,145
Are you here on vacation?.

13
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,952
Yeah, I am here for vacation.
It's my first time.

14
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,187
Did anyone ask you to bring
anything with you from France?.

15
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:50,127
Drugs?. Weapons?. Contraband?.

16
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,619
No.

17
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:52,790
Are you sure about that?.

18
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,129
Yes.

19
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,330
And you'll be staying at
the Hostel to the Stars?.

20
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,706
For how long?.

21
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,711
Three weeks--
Two weeks.

22
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:17,320
Don't make it
any longer than that.

23
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,256
Welcome to the United States.

24
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,599
#

25
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:12,966
Ah, our visitor from France.

26
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,734
Yeah.

27
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,140
You'll be staying with us
for two weeks.

28
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,268
Is that right?.

29
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,802
Yeah, but I can't pay now.
Only tonight?.

30
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,645
Because the taxi
was very expensive.

31
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,912
Certainly.

32
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,476
And what type of room
would you like?.

33
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,489
What's cookin', good lookin'?.

34
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,226
A single room is OK.

35
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,499
$5.50.

36
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,540
Thank you.

37
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,455
It don't get busy
in here until late.

38
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,395
Yeah, I understand.

39
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,421
I arrived just today
from Paris,

40
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,162
so for me
it's very late already.

41
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:26,831
Paris?.
Oooh, ain't you special?.

42
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:42,245
So, are you on vacation
or do you live here?.

43
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:45,485
On vacation.
But who knows?.

44
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,527
Who knows what?.

45
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:53,293
Nothing, nothing.
You live here?.

46
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,300
Born and raised.

47
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,369
So, do you want
to get out of here?.

48
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,004
Where we go?.

49
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,038
Well, I live in Carson, so...

50
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,107
We can walk?.

51
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,948
No, it's too far.

52
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,783
Besides, I can't
really host right now.

53
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,284
Where you stayin' at?.

54
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,396
Excuse me!

55
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:28,365
Yeah?.

56
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,992
Who are you?.

57
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,334
He's my friend.
I have something to show him.

58
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:38,173
No, sorry.
Absolutely no guests.

59
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,541
You have a single room?.

60
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,011
Yeah, it's a single.

61
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,174
Could we upgrade
to a double room?.

62
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,843
No upgrade.

63
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,080
You can rent
a new double room,

64
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,088
but no upgrade.

65
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,225
Sorry.

66
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:04,396
Yeah, I'm kinda
short on cash, so...

67
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:07,997
Yeah, it's OK.
I am tired also.

68
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,099
We can see each other again?.

69
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:14,407
Yeah, maybe.
Have a safe trip.

70
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,093
You go to the beach?.

71
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,298
Last stop on the line.

72
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,500
Ah, OK!

73
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,141
Pacific Coast Highway.
Everybody off.

74
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,786
You got a light?.

75
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,853
Ah, no. I don't smoke.

76
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,590
Can you help me out?.

77
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,693
All I got is these
damn matches.

78
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,434
Hold up--
Yeah, perfect

79
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,714
That'll do it, bro. Thanks!

80
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,911
It's not tobacco, right?.

81
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,678
Easy, man, I got a license.
It's medical.

82
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,950
Oh.

83
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,589
It's always so cold
at the beach?.

84
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:46,564
In the wintertime, yeah.
Where you from?.

85
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,156
France.

86
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,459
I've heard of it.

87
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,239
It was hot in Hollywood.

88
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,538
I took the bus
90 minutes and -

89
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,406
before coming here -

90
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,538
and now...I need
to leave again.

91
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,480
You took the bus
from Hollywood?.

92
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:04,539
Yeah.

93
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:07,814
I'm Ross.

94
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,286
Ah, Jérome.

95
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,413
This is Foxy Brown.

96
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,684
Oh! Nice dog.

97
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,281
Thank you.

98
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,662
Yeah, public transportation
sucks in LA, man.

99
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:21,860
The city is, like, too big -
too new, y'know?.

100
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,535
I got a car though.

101
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:30,064
I could give you a lift, like,
as far as West Hollywood.

102
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,078
West Hollywood?.
Yeah, it's okay?.

103
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,973
- Now?.
- Now.

104
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,616
So what made you
decide to come to LA?.

105
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:43,246
Don't most Europeans
prefer New York or Miami?.

106
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,449
Honestly...

107
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,686
No, it's stupid.

108
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,091
What?.

109
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,126
I hate my job in Paris.

110
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:58,159
So, I don't know...
I was thinking--

111
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,501
Oh, you came to be star!

112
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,871
A star, but,
I told you it was stupid.

113
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,172
No, it's not stupid.

114
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,179
It's just - there's a lot
of competition.

115
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:11,182
Yeah, of course. I know.

116
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,615
Hope you don't
mind my saying,

117
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,983
but you're not
exactly 1 8 anymore.

118
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,392
Can l-- Can we share?.

119
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:22,552
Yeah.

120
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,535
Well, you're very cute.

121
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:42,946
If I could make you a star,
I would do it.

122
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,309
All right.

123
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,781
Here we are.

124
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:23,816
This is West Hollywood?.

125
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:27,552
Yeah, it is.
Yes, this is where I live.

126
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:32,696
The car takes longer
than the bus.

127
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,029
No, it doesn't.
You're just high.

128
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,262
Oh!

129
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,133
Yeah, so West Hollywood.

130
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,264
It's where all
the homos hang out.

131
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,365
And Silverlake too,
which is cool.

132
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,375
Silverlake?.

133
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,808
- Yeah.
- OK, yeah?.

134
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,436
- Yeah?.
- Yeah.

135
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,447
- OK?.
- OK.

136
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,177
Foxy, c'mon.

137
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,525
So I can't believe
I'm going to say this,

138
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,934
but I do have a client who,
like, works for an agency

139
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,904
or something like that.

140
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,907
Maybe you could meet.

141
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,307
Yeah, OK, yeah.
Why not?.

142
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:19,435
I am interested, yeah.

143
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:20,809
- Yeah?.
- Yeah.

144
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:24,111
All right, well,
she's a big old stoner.

145
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,413
I see her all the time.

146
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,545
Call me tomorrow.
We can set something up.

147
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,215
Oh, yeah.

148
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:36,816
Sorry I can't give you
a lift back to your hotel.

149
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:40,423
It's OK, um,
I can walk to Hollywood.

150
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,932
Yeah?.

151
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,405
See ya.

152
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,488
Hey, Baby, you like
what you seein'?.

153
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,158
Hi, cutie.

154
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,503
Hey.

155
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,064
Want a ride?.

156
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,042
I'm going to Wilcox and Selma.

157
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,204
Sure, dude, jump on in.
Come on.

158
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,482
- Oh, no, he's nasty!
- He's Nasty!

159
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,145
C'mon, don't let those bitches
change your mind.

160
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,784
I will walk.
It's OK, thanks.

161
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:41,758
Thank you.

162
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,818
Your loss, cocksucker.

163
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,158
- Bye!
- Call me, Booboo.

164
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:52,033
Wha- What happened?.

165
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,561
We know this girl
named Lakeesha.

166
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,301
She went out with him
two weeks ago

167
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,605
and we have not
seen her since.

168
00:22:58,643 --> 00:22:59,575
And when you call her up

169
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:01,078
her phone goes
straight to voicemail.

170
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,911
Before that, Lakeesha always
picked up her phone.

171
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,780
Just wanted to
let you know, honey.

172
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,011
Just a warning, Boo. OK?.

173
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,519
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

174
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,350
- You're welcome.
- You're welcome.

175
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,053
He is so cute.

176
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:15,184
Very cute.

177
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,458
I'm a' go holler at him.
Hold on.

178
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:21,466
Hey, hey! Excuse me!
Excuse me!

179
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,996
Where you from?.

180
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,003
From Paris, France.

181
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:50,558
I moved from
Lafayette, Louisiana

182
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,290
a while back.

183
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,524
Where are you going
dressed like that?.

184
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,730
I was at the beach and I'm
going to Wilcox and Selma.

185
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,638
Oh, Wilcox and Selma?.
That's perfect.

186
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,108
My best girlfriend
is over at the Spotlight.

187
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:07,111
Ah, the Spotlight bar?.
I know this bar.

188
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,772
Oh, really?.

189
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,927
My luggage was stolen.
There is nothing in my room.

190
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,797
Your luggage was not stolen.

191
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:32,133
It was relocated because
we needed that room.

192
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,569
But it's my room.

193
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,039
Not anymore it's not.

194
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:39,237
You only paid for one night.
Remember?.

195
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:42,440
I rented your room
to somebody else.

196
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:46,042
You can give me
your key for your luggage.

197
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:52,213
Welcome to the Z Hotel.
How can I help you?.

198
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,122
I'm looking for a room.

199
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,524
Do you have a reservation?.

200
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,822
No.

201
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,758
Yes, I have
a suite available -

202
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,963
- with a king size
bed and a view -

203
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,700
- of the Hollywood sign
for just $290 -

204
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,934
- $375 -

205
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:12,671
- $31 5 a night.

206
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,736
$31 5?.

207
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:15,746
That's right.

208
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,805
Is there anything else
less expensive?.

209
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,079
No, I'm afraid that's
our lowest rate.

210
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:22,279
Thank you.
I will continue to look.

211
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:27,522
Sorry.

212
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,561
Vodka tonic.

213
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,148
$5.50.

214
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,983
You left me
nothing last night.

215
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,184
What?.

216
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,194
In America
we tip the bartender.

217
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,686
Ah, yes, the tip.
Sorry.

218
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:17,640
Ah, Lakeesha.

219
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:20,577
No, I'm Kaleesha.

220
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:21,874
Oscar, could you get up?.

221
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,278
Get up!

222
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:31,687
So, Jérome, je vous présente:.
The Lady Norma Desire.

223
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:36,057
I'm not French,
but enchantée, I'm sure.

224
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,392
Hello, nice to meet you.

225
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:42,026
So, Jérome,
what's with that suitcase?.

226
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,194
Oh, I moved from my hotel.

227
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,226
It was a piece of shit.

228
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:52,141
But now every place that I've
found is terribly expensive.

229
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:54,737
I can't pay $300 for a night.

230
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,269
And I don't know--

231
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:57,941
Excuse you!

232
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,352
Can I get you a drink?.

233
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,154
No, no, thank you.
I can get my own.

234
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,988
Hell, no!

235
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:16,530
So, Jérome, Norma has this
beautiful house in Silverlake.

236
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,160
It's nice, Silverlake?.

237
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:20,535
If you like
baby strollers and Volvos.

238
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,972
Well, I was gonna crash
at her place tonight anyway

239
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,270
and I was thinking...

240
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,539
My home has always been
a short-term refuge

241
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:29,103
for lost souls here
in the city of angels.

242
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,809
We were thinking that
maybe if you could

243
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,683
front our taxi ride
over there then...

244
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:37,552
'cause it gets a bit ugly
on the bus this time of night.

245
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,262
Yeah, OK. Let's go.

246
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,855
Let's go.

247
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:55,066
Home, sweet home!

248
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:03,405
I've been preserving it
since the '80s.

249
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,975
It was just me and
the Mexicans back then.

250
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,213
Ah, those were the days.

251
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:24,458
I like, it's, uh...

252
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:27,369
Shabby chic, as the
say in English -

253
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:29,873
emphasis on the shabby.

254
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,736
Kaleesha, honey,
do you want some vino?.

255
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,276
Rule number one
for staying in my house:.

256
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:39,909
What I say goes.

257
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:43,853
You piss me off,
you're out of here.

258
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,719
Absolute power.

259
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,190
You're French;

260
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,625
you ought to be familiar
with the concept.

261
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:53,293
No drugs beyond the
boos and the nummy.

262
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:54,992
No guests.

263
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,627
And finally, you'll have
your very own room.

264
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:00,638
You'll never entire mine, ever.

265
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:31,627
She's got it bad for you.

266
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:33,296
You should have
heard her tell me

267
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:36,273
about this hot frog she
followed down the boulevard.

268
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:40,443
Promise me you won't hurt her.

269
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:44,941
I'm not--
Sorry, I don't like...

270
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,584
Homeless black trannys?.

271
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,323
Follow me upstairs.

272
00:29:57,495 --> 00:30:00,623
This is what I can offer you.

273
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:03,691
It's a work in progress,
as you can see.

274
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,160
My last guest
in this room -

275
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:07,569
well, I just didn't
have the heart

276
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:09,072
to clean it after he left.

277
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,200
Oh, yeah. He had a ferret.

278
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,710
The aroma sort of
lingers a little bit.

279
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:19,145
Or if you prefer,
I'm sure Kaleesha

280
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,209
would like your company
down on the couch.

281
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:23,277
Oh, no, it's OK.

282
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,948
Well, with that,
I bid you, "au revoir."

283
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,260
#

284
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,692
Hello.

285
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,062
French?.

286
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,503
Yeah, I'm French, yeah.

287
00:32:57,775 --> 00:33:00,505
Some nudity required?.

288
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:03,173
Does this mean
it's a porno?.

289
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,914
Uh, what is SAG?.

290
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:31,340
What do you
think you're doing?.

291
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:32,741
I found this broom and--

292
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,210
Where's Kaleesha?.

293
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:36,076
I don't know.
I went out this morning

294
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:38,378
and when I came back
she was gone.

295
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,748
Well, what do we have here?.

296
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,480
It's nothing.

297
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:46,323
Far be it for me
to piss on your parade, Jérome,

298
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,484
but let me give you
a little advice.

299
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,517
Nobody gets
discovered anymore.

300
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:53,029
That element of
the Hollywood dream -

301
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:54,861
it's long since expired.

302
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:57,294
I was just curious.

303
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:58,962
And I can tell
by your casting pursuits

304
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:01,233
and your sudden burst
of housework

305
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:03,297
you want to stay
a while at the Chez Norma?.

306
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,536
The Olive Motel on Sunset
has a room rate

307
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:09,103
that I can't pay,
but if the room is free,

308
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:11,445
maybe I can improve it?.

309
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:15,683
Remember the rules...

310
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,745
And remember it's temporary.

311
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:22,121
I'll get you a key.

312
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,699
You go to the West Hollywood?.

313
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:32,725
Yeah, keep movin'.

314
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,328
Ah, OK.

315
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,773
Hello.

316
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,373
What's up?.

317
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:51,780
I have to ask -

318
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,791
where in West Hollywood
are you going?.

319
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:56,692
No, I'm visiting a friend.

320
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:57,853
Why?.
Where are you going?.

321
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:01,626
I mean what intersection
are you going to?.

322
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,531
Ah, Santa Monica Boulevard.

323
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:07,060
Yeah, this is the
Santa Monica Local.

324
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,335
Santa Monica and what?.

325
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,802
- La Cienega.
- La Clenega?.

326
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:13,310
Yeah.

327
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:17,370
You totally could have
taken the Rapid Bus.

328
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,780
The Rapid Bus?.

329
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:21,785
Yeah, the 704,
the Santa Monica Express.

330
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,844
When you're going
long distances in LA

331
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,685
it's all about the Rapid Bus.

332
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:27,748
So it's better to take
the Rapid Bus?.

333
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,022
No, no, no.
You're on the bus.

334
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:31,653
Once you're on one bus,

335
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:34,164
don't ever get off
to wait for another bus.

336
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:36,325
You'll regret it. Trust me.

337
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,693
Do you work for the bus?.

338
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:43,504
No, but I'm car-free.

339
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:46,601
I have been for two years now.

340
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,202
You're either part
of the problem

341
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:51,010
or you're part of the solution.
You know?.

342
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,645
I never learned to drive.

343
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,649
Don't start.

344
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,660
Hey, you made it.
Come in. Bonjour.

345
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:06,162
Bonjour.

346
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:11,023
Jérome, this is Sarah.
Sarah, Jérome.

347
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,869
Sit.

348
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:24,214
You good?.

349
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:25,408
Very fine, yeah.

350
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,076
Good, good.

351
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,649
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

352
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:33,387
How do l, uh--

353
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:36,393
Well, here, put your lips
on the hole.

354
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:40,625
And I'm going to light
and you suck.

355
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:43,666
Suck, suck, suck, suck.

356
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:46,100
Yep, now don't forget
to pull out.

357
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:51,301
Ooh, it's strong.

358
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:52,309
Yes, it is.

359
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,243
Wait, are you ltalian?.

360
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:55,802
No, I am French.

361
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,404
Handsome ltalian, 25 to 30,

362
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,609
must cast before Christmas
to shoot before New Years.

363
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,311
Oh, yeah, it's Christmas.

364
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:03,647
Who's your agent?.

365
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:05,755
An agent?.
No I don't have an agent.

366
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,018
But you're an actor, right?.

367
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,719
Yeah, yeah, I am an actor.

368
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,021
How old are you?.

369
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,894
Twenty-nine.
You're 29.

370
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,023
Yeah, 29,
but I'm not ltalian.

371
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,533
I come from France.

372
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,261
It doesn't matter.

373
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:18,962
The casting director
was telling me today

374
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:21,028
that all her submissions
are too Latin.

375
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,006
You're white,
you have a big nose,

376
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,268
you have an accent.

377
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:25,536
Close enough.

378
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,635
Do you have a headshot
that you could email me?.

379
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,475
No, I don't have a headshot.

380
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:30,502
Yet!

381
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,812
You don't have a headshot yet,
but you will.

382
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,613
Fresh off the boat, right?.

383
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:36,882
You're not leaving
for Christmas, are you?.

384
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,013
Yeah, I'm here for Christmas.

385
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:39,750
Can you stand up
against this wall here?.

386
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,417
Why not?.

387
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,153
Oh, I gotta go.

388
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,256
Ross, can I get a
quarter bag on the way out?.

389
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:49,425
Yep.

390
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:56,271
Take your pick.

391
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,508
The prettiest one.

392
00:37:58,542 --> 00:37:59,873
For the prettiest girl.

393
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,468
Thank you.

394
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,913
I can't make
any promises, sweetie,

395
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,506
'cause you're really green.

396
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,322
Can I hit one of those
for the road?.

397
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,088
Yeah, of course.

398
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:30,596
Thanks, babe.

399
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:31,869
OK, sweetheart.

400
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:33,103
Ross knows how
to get hold of you?.

401
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,271
Yeah, you can
reach him through me.

402
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:37,573
See you later.

403
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,077
See ya!

404
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,113
That was bizarre.

405
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,284
That was Sarah.

406
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,692
That never happens,
by the way.

407
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:53,196
No, but ltalian,
29 years old.

408
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:59,428
Well, I think you better
get a local cell.

409
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,597
Ah, yeah, maybe, yeah.

410
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:06,599
All right...

411
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,043
Suck.

412
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,709
Yeah, good suck.

413
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:18,214
Two, six, two, eight.

414
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,553
Now, I'll call you.

415
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:24,358
Now, OK.

416
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:25,327
[phone rings]

417
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,332
Voilà!
Now you have mine, too.

418
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,233
I just can't believe it.

419
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,362
I've been here
for over a year

420
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:36,600
and I've never
met an agent.

421
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,541
It's like it was
destiny or somethin.

422
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:41,010
Yeah.

423
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:46,245
Good morning, Norma.

424
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:48,609
Where's the orange juice?.

425
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,745
Jérome met
an agent yesterday,

426
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:53,621
and he has
an audition today!

427
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:55,557
Yeah, sorry, Norma.

428
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:58,687
I will buy more orange juice
after my casting.

429
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,129
Hello.

430
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:44,141
Hi.

431
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,904
You are Tiffani?.

432
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,570
That's right.

433
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,704
And you?.
What's your name?.

434
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,578
Jérome, Jérome Beaunez.

435
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:58,379
I don't have a résumé
or headshot...or agent.

436
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,788
It's my first casting.

437
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:05,357
Maybe I should go.

438
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,597
No, wait. Stay.

439
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,163
It's an open call
for a music video.

440
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:12,863
It's not Shakespeare.

441
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:21,540
I don't have
an agent either.

442
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:23,774
But, uh...

443
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:24,712
Shhh.

444
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:25,510
Don't tell anyone,

445
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:27,574
but that's my
mom's cell phone.

446
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:31,013
Just write down somebody's
number that you trust

447
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:33,023
and make up
an agency name.

448
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,356
Oh, and when
they call you in,

449
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:39,191
tell them that you, like,
forgot your headshot.

450
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,788
Oh, yeah.

451
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:48,063
The audition starts as soon
as you enter the building.

452
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:52,406
OK, so this is going
to be quick and easy.

453
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,343
You're gonna do
slates and profiles,

454
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:56,141
then I'm gonna
put on the music,

455
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,876
and then you're gonna dance
as if you're in a nightclub.

456
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:00,440
After a minute or so

457
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:02,509
I'm gonna call you
one by one.

458
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:04,350
You're gonna come
forward to the camera

459
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:05,685
and give a solo dance.

460
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:09,056
And just keep it
cool, sexy, casual.

461
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:10,219
Any questions?.

462
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:15,659
OK, first up
is Jerome Beaneze.

463
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:21,829
No, no, no, no!

464
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:25,569
Slates and profiles first,
then we dance.

465
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,011
Slates and profiles?.

466
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,912
You look into the camera,

467
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:33,610
you give your name
and your agency,

468
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:34,743
and then profiles.

469
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:36,309
Do you want to restart?.

470
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:37,877
Yes, please.

471
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:41,585
This is why
I fucking hate open calls.

472
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:43,422
Darlin' you are
preachin' at the choir.

473
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,954
We are rolling.

474
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:47,922
Jerome Beaneze.

475
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:51,765
I am Jérome Beaunez,
from Kaleesha Talent.

476
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:53,929
Kaleesha Talent, interesting.

477
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,967
Profiles.

478
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:02,104
All right.

479
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:04,371

480
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:10,250
Amber Sparks.
I'm represented by DDA.

481
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:15,886
Thanks, Amber.

482
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,793
All right, Steve Jaspers.

483
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:22,962
Steve Jaspers,
Actors Unlimited.

484
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:29,965
Thank you, Steve.

485
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:32,100
And finally, Tiffani Schein.

486
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:36,309
Hi. Tiffani Schein,
Caroline Talent.

487
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:41,708
All right...
Let's do this.

488
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,753
[dance music plays]

489
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:01,763
And solo dance, Jérome!

490
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:13,683
Amber.

491
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:30,399
Steve Jaspers.

492
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,979
OK. Tiffani Schein.

493
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:07,236
OK. That's it.

494
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:08,363
Thanks, everybody.

495
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,101
Thank you very much.

496
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:13,507
Thanks.

497
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:15,801
Thanks so much
for having me.

498
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:17,211
Yeah.

499
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:18,314
Saiyonara.

500
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:27,490
What is that?.

501
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:29,598
So what are you into?.

502
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,260
Whatever you like.

503
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:34,803
Presently I am all bottom.

504
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:39,707
Dude, there's no way
I can top tonight.

505
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:41,711
I've done way
too much partying -

506
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:43,576
way too much partying.

507
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:45,308
Yeah, I understand.

508
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:47,773
You're French,
is that right?.

509
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,183
Yeah.

510
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:50,846
I work in a French restaurant

511
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:54,983
in Echo Park
called Café l'Etoile.

512
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:58,388
You speak French?.

513
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:01,762
No.

514
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:06,599
Beyond bouillabaisse
and steak frites, no.

515
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:11,341
You look like Adrien Brody.

516
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:15,168
I want you to fuck me.

517
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:22,184
I'm sorry. I need to go.

518
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:49,204
Good morning, handsome.

519
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:50,873
Oh, good morning.

00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:52,842
Thank you for the O.J.

00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,111
Yeah, no problem.

522
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:56,415
And that funny french cheese,
that's yours.

is lactose intolerant.

524
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:00,584
C'mon in.
Come, come, come in.

525
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:02,148
Take a load off.

526
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:04,183
I can come in your room?.

527
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,457
If I invite you, yes.

528
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:13,230
I heard from Kaleesha.

529
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:15,602
What?. Did I get a call back?.

530
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:16,799
No, I heard from Kaleesha

531
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,434
that the two of you
spent the evening together.

532
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:20,636
No.

533
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:21,473
She's not in your bedroom?.

534
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:23,411
No.

535
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:25,244
It's nothing to be
ashamed of, Jérome.

536
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:28,251
No, last night I was
here a while

537
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:31,379
and I went to
West Hollywood spa.

538
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,116
Why that little scamp.

539
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:37,656
She was supposed
to meet me at karaoke,

540
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:39,423
and she texted me
an hour later not to worry,

541
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:40,760
that she was with you.

542
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,264
It's not true.

543
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:45,631
I don't like that crowd
down on the boulevard.

544
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:49,196
It's always the next John
to the next score.

545
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:53,768
I don't know why I take you
into my heart.

546
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:57,575
That's not me.

547
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:00,139
I came to Los Angeles
for to be an actor,

548
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:01,582
not a tranny prostitute.

549
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,644
And you think
it's so very different?.

550
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,053
Whatever.

551
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:11,690
I came here
with my daddy's inheritance

552
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:13,958
from Paducah, Kentucky.

553
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:18,457
I wanted the world to love me
the way the he never had.

554
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:21,835
And the only way to
achieve that, in my mind,

555
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:25,535
was up on the big screen

556
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:30,205
But Hollywood wants its faggots
behind the camera, not in front.

557
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:33,481
Lucky for me, I was smart
enough to put down

558
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:35,849
roots in this shitty
little neighborhood,

559
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:39,652
which over the decades
has become quite chic.

560
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:45,291
I like your neighborhood,
I like your house.

561
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,455
At least I got
a roof over my head.

562
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:50,523
And the love...

563
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,592
[phone ringing]

564
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:58,469
I stopped looking
for that a long time ago.

565
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:28,471
Hi. I am here
for pizza casting.

566
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,964
You were supposed
to be here by 4:.00.

567
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,235
Oh, I know.

568
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:34,106
I only got the call
two hours ago

569
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:35,702
and I took the bus.

570
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:37,736
I came as soon as I could.

571
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:38,713
Who's your agent?.

572
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:42,912
My agent is Sarah,
of Walter Norris Agency.

573
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:45,945
Oh, yeah, she told us
you were coming.

574
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:47,957
Headshot and résumé?.

575
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:50,821
I forgot, yeah.

576
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,623
I don't have a résumé
and headshot, no.

577
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:55,922
Wait here.

578
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,563
Come in.

579
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:03,732
I've got a French guy here
without a résumé.

580
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:08,136
You're in luck.

581
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,950
All right, all the actresses
have gone home already,

582
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:17,817
so I'll be playing your date.

583
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:19,685
We're going to start
in that corner over there,

584
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:21,782
holding hands - we're on a date.

585
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:24,293
Then we're going to walk
to that corner over there.

586
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:26,989
When we're done with that we're
going to come to this table,

587
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:30,488
sit, and we're going to share
the product, Buongiorno Pizza.

588
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:33,427
We're out of pizza...

589
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:36,462
so we'll be
eating rice cakes.

590
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:40,533
But eat it like it's a hot,
delicious piece of pizza.

591
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:43,911
This is Thom.
He'll be directing us.

592
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,312
Hi.

593
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,080
Any questions?.

594
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,676
Yeah, do I say anything?.

595
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:52,153
There's no dialogue,
just walkin' and eatin'.

596
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:53,951
OK, let's get your slate.

597
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:58,652
I am Jérome Beaunez.
My agent is Walter--

598
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:02,529
My agent is Sarah
of Walter Norris Agency.

599
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,759
Can we get
your profiles, Jérome?.

600
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:07,961
[whispers]
Look at that nose.

601
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:09,767
Opposite side, please.

602
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,407
[whispers]
He looks like Adrien Brody.

603
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:15,843
OK, let's do
some walkin' in Rome.

604
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:17,574
And, action.

605
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:22,244
And, cut!

606
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:25,043
OK.

607
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:27,215
We're gonna do it
one more time.

608
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:32,561
Cheryl, give us...Iess.

609
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:36,832
Jérome, a little...more.

610
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,533
Action!

611
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:44,463
And, cut!

612
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,498
Better, better.

613
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:48,340
But Jérome, remember -

614
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:51,040
you really love this person.
OK?.

615
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:55,381
It's not forced.
It's just-- it's...

616
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:58,080
It's just true love, OK?.

617
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,489
Action!

618
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,329
And cut!

619
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:28,310
It was ridiculous -
not even any dialogue.

620
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:32,548
Considering you're
not really italian,

621
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:34,352
that's probably a good thing.

622
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:35,421
Yeah.

623
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:40,185
Does Sarah cast for movies, too,
or just commercials?.

624
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:44,394
I don't know.

625
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:49,836
Yeah, maybe I should
go back to Paris.

626
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:52,899
C'mon now.
Your big Hollywood film career

627
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:55,843
is not gonna go anywhere
if you do that.

628
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:57,437
Yeah, I know.

629
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:01,840
Look, tomorrow is Christmas Eve,

630
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:05,082
so just
forget about it, you know?.

631
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:08,284
Yeah, I almost forgot
the Christmas.

632
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:11,020
This is the weather, I think.

633
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:15,297
Yeah, I'm not really
much of a holiday guy myself.

634
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:18,266
They're so family-oriented.

635
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:21,293
I'm so...not.

636
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:22,702
Yeah, I understand.

637
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:32,341
Uh, we can?. Here?.

638
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:33,644
It's a--

639
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:35,844
Hell, yeah!
It's a public beach.

640
00:57:56,372 --> 00:58:00,035
I should probably tell you
something at this point -

641
00:58:00,076 --> 00:58:05,514
just so you...
have all the information.

642
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:11,278
I'm positive.

643
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:17,018
I'm healthy and all that, but,
you know - positive.

644
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:26,561
How long have
you been, uh...

645
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:30,772
Since the mid-90s.

646
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:34,273
The dawn of
protease inhibitors.

647
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:36,878
No. I'm going to ask,

648
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:39,279
how long have you
been selling the weed?.

649
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:43,544
It's your job, right?.

650
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:47,349
Yeah, it's my job.

651
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,493
I used to be
a hair stylist, actually.

652
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:55,155
Now I still listen
to peoples problems,

653
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:58,292
I just make a hell of
a lot more money

654
00:58:58,334 --> 00:58:59,596
and I never have to
leave my apartment,

655
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:01,627
except to go
to the beach so...

656
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:08,568
It's good, this.
Can I buy a bag from you?.

657
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:14,479
Here.

658
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:22,857
Call it a free sample.

659
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:26,488
The next one you buy.

660
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:31,327
Why are you so nice to me?.

661
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:33,932
Because you're sexy and French;

662
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:35,870
I'm want to get in your pants.

663
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,133
Thanks.

664
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:39,834
No, for the bag, I mean.

665
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:45,110
It's finished.

666
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,641
Yeah.

667
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:56,054
It's strange...
I don't have a VlH.

668
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,690
HlV in English.

669
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:05,399
Because I have had
much sex with many men.

670
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:08,235
Yeah, me too.

671
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:12,971
You know, it's just a thing.

672
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,175
It's me.

673
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:26,515
Yes, I'm going to Silver Lake.

674
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:29,655
Don't have to.

675
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:34,390
You can crash here...
No strings attached.

676
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:43,971
Thank you, Ross.

677
01:01:16,508 --> 01:01:18,567
Bon matin, Kaleesha.
ca va?.

678
01:01:22,447 --> 01:01:25,382
I just had a dream about you.

679
01:01:25,417 --> 01:01:26,406
Oh, yeah?.

680
01:01:26,451 --> 01:01:28,476
We was in Paris and--

681
01:01:28,654 --> 01:01:30,554
What you lookin' at, Jérome?.

682
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:34,750
Listen, I want to
fix my bedroom.

683
01:01:34,793 --> 01:01:37,193
Norma's door is closed...

684
01:01:37,229 --> 01:01:39,595
so I was thinking
maybe you can help me?.

685
01:01:39,631 --> 01:01:40,893
Oh, no.

686
01:01:40,932 --> 01:01:42,593
I am not spending
my Christmas Eve

687
01:01:42,634 --> 01:01:44,499
cleaning up that
wreck of a room.

688
01:01:44,536 --> 01:01:46,470
That's your bag.

689
01:01:48,206 --> 01:01:50,538
It's too bad,
because I have this.

690
01:01:50,575 --> 01:01:52,372
It could be fun.

691
01:02:11,096 --> 01:02:13,223
Oh, look.
It's the food of your people.

692
01:02:13,265 --> 01:02:16,462
Oh, yeah, Café l'Etoile.

693
01:02:16,501 --> 01:02:18,560
There is a sexy waiter here.

694
01:02:18,603 --> 01:02:20,935
- Oh, yeah?.
- Yeah.

695
01:02:20,972 --> 01:02:22,667
You've eatin' here before?.

696
01:02:23,375 --> 01:02:24,842
No.

697
01:02:26,178 --> 01:02:28,612
I cannot believe you
have me doing manual labor.

698
01:02:28,647 --> 01:02:31,138
I do not do anything
with 'man' in the word -

699
01:02:31,183 --> 01:02:32,650
not for free.

700
01:02:40,025 --> 01:02:42,118
You can come in, Kaleesha.

701
01:02:43,595 --> 01:02:46,257
Why are you so like this?.

702
01:02:47,866 --> 01:02:50,699
I just haven't been in this room
in a while, that's all.

703
01:02:51,269 --> 01:02:52,236
Yeah, it's a dump.

704
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:54,067
You have never
sleep before here?.

705
01:02:56,074 --> 01:02:57,632
I have.

706
01:02:58,777 --> 01:03:00,711
Just not in a while, no.

707
01:03:01,279 --> 01:03:04,305
You knew the guy
who was here before?.

708
01:03:07,285 --> 01:03:08,718
Joel.

709
01:03:10,389 --> 01:03:12,254
His name was Joel -

710
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:16,056
a musician I met playing
for tips on Hollywood Boulevard.

711
01:03:16,094 --> 01:03:18,119
It's through Joel I met Norma.

712
01:03:21,099 --> 01:03:22,327
Oh, and uh- -

713
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:27,066
He was...
a tranny chaser, you know.

714
01:03:27,105 --> 01:03:31,735
And, uh...
so you two, uh...

715
01:03:34,913 --> 01:03:38,178
No...not really.

716
01:03:39,484 --> 01:03:42,009
I was in love with him though.

717
01:03:42,053 --> 01:03:43,486
[whispers]
So was Norma.

718
01:03:44,589 --> 01:03:47,353
He just...

719
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:51,324
He didn't exactly
love himself though, you know?.

720
01:03:51,363 --> 01:03:53,331
Yeah, it's not easy, yeah.

721
01:03:54,766 --> 01:03:56,996
I can still feel him in here.

722
01:04:07,412 --> 01:04:09,175
I understand.

723
01:04:16,455 --> 01:04:18,946
It take a long time
to paint a room.

724
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:21,117
Child, please,
who you tellin'?.

725
01:04:23,128 --> 01:04:25,926
And we just started...
Dang.

726
01:04:26,832 --> 01:04:28,060
I was thinking...

727
01:04:28,099 --> 01:04:29,862
I have a new
apartment in Paris.

728
01:04:29,901 --> 01:04:32,233
I haven't done
any work on it.

729
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:37,333
Oh, really?.
A new apartment in Paris.

730
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,434
That sounds so glamorous.

731
01:04:39,478 --> 01:04:41,036
It's not.

732
01:04:41,379 --> 01:04:46,373
The entire apartment is about
the size of this room.

733
01:04:46,418 --> 01:04:49,148
And I am alone there.
It's very depressing.

734
01:04:49,187 --> 01:04:51,815
Well, I know all about that.

735
01:04:54,292 --> 01:04:56,522
Where do you sleep
when you don't sleep here?.

736
01:04:56,561 --> 01:04:58,529
With whoever is
paying me to be there.

737
01:05:01,833 --> 01:05:04,324
Other friends, other mens.

738
01:05:06,037 --> 01:05:08,665
I've been known
to sleep outdoors, too.

739
01:05:09,774 --> 01:05:12,402
You should sleep here,
not outside.

740
01:05:14,446 --> 01:05:16,710
Is that an invitation?.

741
01:05:16,748 --> 01:05:18,841
Yeah, no.

742
01:06:36,628 --> 01:06:38,027
Here we go.

743
01:06:38,964 --> 01:06:40,454
Jérome, light me up, baby.

744
01:06:48,239 --> 01:06:50,730
Well, what do you think?.

745
01:06:50,775 --> 01:06:53,141
It's still empty, but, uh...

746
01:06:53,878 --> 01:06:55,812
It's as if
he never lived here.

747
01:06:55,847 --> 01:06:57,872
Well, now it's Jérome
that lives here.

748
01:06:57,916 --> 01:06:59,747
Or Kaleesha
or whoever you want.

749
01:06:59,784 --> 01:07:01,445
No, no, no. It's fine.

750
01:07:01,486 --> 01:07:03,477
I just preferred
how it was before.

751
01:07:03,521 --> 01:07:04,988
That's all.

752
01:07:07,859 --> 01:07:10,157
You prefer how it was before?.

753
01:07:10,195 --> 01:07:12,561
Quelle salope!
You prefer how it was before?.

754
01:07:12,597 --> 01:07:14,326
It looks just the same now.

755
01:07:14,366 --> 01:07:17,995
All right, all right,
all right, all right!

756
01:07:18,536 --> 01:07:20,902
Geeze, you ought
to be an actress -

757
01:07:20,939 --> 01:07:23,134
you are a drama queen,
Miss Edith Piaf.

758
01:07:23,174 --> 01:07:24,232
Who is that?.

759
01:07:24,275 --> 01:07:25,867
I worked hard on this room!

760
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:27,605
Yeah, me too.

761
01:07:27,646 --> 01:07:30,740
Why don't you go wrap
a Christmas present, sweet tits.

762
01:07:30,782 --> 01:07:32,647
I need to talk to Jérome.

763
01:07:32,684 --> 01:07:33,981
OK.

764
01:07:36,655 --> 01:07:42,616
Jérome, you did me a big favor,
and I am grateful.

765
01:07:42,661 --> 01:07:44,788
You know I just
have to catch up.

766
01:07:45,563 --> 01:07:47,497
How 'bout if
I make it up to you?.

767
01:07:47,532 --> 01:07:49,295
I'll take us all out
for Christmas dinner.

768
01:07:49,334 --> 01:07:51,632
OK?. Hmm?.

769
01:07:55,907 --> 01:07:59,866
#

770
01:08:14,993 --> 01:08:20,659
[laughing, singing]

771
01:08:53,298 --> 01:08:55,596
Jérome?. Jérome!

772
01:08:55,633 --> 01:08:57,362
It is you!
What's up?.

773
01:08:57,402 --> 01:08:58,733
What are you doing?.

774
01:08:58,770 --> 01:08:59,862
I'm waiting for the bus.

775
01:08:59,904 --> 01:09:01,633
Get in, man,
I'll give you a ride.

776
01:09:01,673 --> 01:09:03,163
Watch your back, though.

777
01:09:03,208 --> 01:09:05,904
This is Norma.
This is Kaleesha.

778
01:09:05,944 --> 01:09:08,572
We are together,
the three of us.

779
01:09:08,646 --> 01:09:10,136
Oh...

780
01:09:10,648 --> 01:09:12,115
Hey, I know you.

781
01:09:12,150 --> 01:09:15,779
You're the one that does
the drag queen bingo thing.

782
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:18,880
That's right, hot stuff.
Are you one of my players?.

783
01:09:18,923 --> 01:09:20,857
Oh, no, no, no, no.

784
01:09:20,892 --> 01:09:22,917
And what are you
doing in downtown?.

785
01:09:22,961 --> 01:09:26,920
I am making a little
Christmas delivery,

786
01:09:26,965 --> 01:09:29,627
but I'm done, so get in.

787
01:09:29,667 --> 01:09:31,225
We can go to
The Abbey or something.

788
01:09:31,269 --> 01:09:33,635
Oh, I like their apple martinis.

789
01:09:33,671 --> 01:09:36,868
Oh, girl, yes.
Oh, I love those things.

790
01:09:36,908 --> 01:09:41,368
Oh, I would, but with Foxy
it's so crowded.

791
01:09:41,412 --> 01:09:42,436
That's OK.

792
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,176
Kaleesha don't mind
no dog on top of her, right?.

793
01:09:45,216 --> 01:09:48,049
Yeah, it's with Norma
I'm staying in Silver Lake.

794
01:09:48,086 --> 01:09:51,055
Oh, I'm sorry you didn't
tell me you were staying with...

795
01:09:53,825 --> 01:09:55,452
The bus is coming.

796
01:10:03,001 --> 01:10:06,334
Look, it's nothing personal.
I'm high.

797
01:10:06,371 --> 01:10:09,169
I get socially awkward
when I'm high.

798
01:10:09,207 --> 01:10:12,176
No, you're a dick
when you're high!

799
01:10:15,814 --> 01:10:19,477
And that is exactly why
I cannot stand drag queens.

800
01:10:19,517 --> 01:10:21,144
Always drama!

801
01:10:21,186 --> 01:10:22,915
Get in. Come on.

802
01:10:22,954 --> 01:10:24,353
You do not
want to take the bus.

803
01:10:24,389 --> 01:10:26,016
Hey, hey, hey!

804
01:10:29,861 --> 01:10:32,227
Yes...yes, I do.

805
01:10:38,236 --> 01:10:40,101
Merry Christmas!

806
01:10:40,138 --> 01:10:42,606
It's the wrong bus,
but I'll take it.

807
01:11:04,495 --> 01:11:07,089
Sure, sugar, I can do six.

808
01:11:07,131 --> 01:11:09,122
You want to buy me
a drink first?.

809
01:11:10,001 --> 01:11:11,662
I'll meet you anywhere
in the 323.

810
01:11:12,937 --> 01:11:14,871
No, the corner is fine.

811
01:11:15,573 --> 01:11:17,336
All right, see you at six.

812
01:11:21,412 --> 01:11:22,970
Who is that?.

813
01:11:23,014 --> 01:11:25,983
Dimitri... My regular gig.

814
01:11:27,252 --> 01:11:30,278
He gives you money for...

815
01:11:31,856 --> 01:11:34,051
A blow job in his car.

816
01:11:34,092 --> 01:11:36,117
Eighty bucks and I don't
have to swallow.

817
01:11:36,794 --> 01:11:39,160
But he like it better
if I do, though.

818
01:11:41,132 --> 01:11:43,191
Oh, until then I'm outta' cash.

819
01:11:43,234 --> 01:11:45,065
You can spot me
for a cup of coffee?.

820
01:11:45,103 --> 01:11:46,468
Oh, yeah, OK.

821
01:11:46,504 --> 01:11:47,493
Put that out.

822
01:11:47,538 --> 01:11:48,903
Yeah.

823
01:11:55,847 --> 01:11:58,372
I need to make money
if I want to stay here.

824
01:11:58,416 --> 01:12:01,783
Oh, but you have to stay.
You like it here, right?.

825
01:12:01,819 --> 01:12:04,788
Yeah, yeah, I like,
but I don't have a green card.

826
01:12:04,822 --> 01:12:05,811
So?.

827
01:12:05,857 --> 01:12:09,918
Get a job waiting tables
at, um, Café l'Etoile.

828
01:12:10,261 --> 01:12:12,422
But I'm not legal.

829
01:12:12,463 --> 01:12:15,489
You think all these people
workin' here are legal?.

830
01:12:15,533 --> 01:12:17,797
I doubt it.

831
01:12:17,835 --> 01:12:19,735
But they are
probably all Cuban.

832
01:12:19,771 --> 01:12:22,296
Why?.
Because this is a Cuban cafe.

833
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:26,970
So you think I could
work under the table?.

834
01:12:28,579 --> 01:12:31,912
Look, all actors
are waiters first.

835
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:36,717
I mean, I would
do it myself, but...

836
01:12:36,754 --> 01:12:39,120
You're right - it would suck.

837
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:53,332
I'll be right with you.

838
01:12:53,905 --> 01:12:55,338
You can sit wherever you like.

839
01:12:55,373 --> 01:12:56,397
Ah!

840
01:13:09,287 --> 01:13:11,084
You don't remember me?.

841
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:13,981
I thought you looked familiar.

842
01:13:14,025 --> 01:13:15,458
Did we...

843
01:13:16,527 --> 01:13:18,256
You worked on that
Paramount shoot, right?.

844
01:13:18,296 --> 01:13:19,490
No!

845
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:22,294
In the West Hollywood spa
two nights ago.

846
01:13:23,835 --> 01:13:26,827
Oh, yeah...

847
01:13:26,871 --> 01:13:30,398
Oh, yeah.
You're the French guy.

848
01:13:30,441 --> 01:13:31,806
Yeah.

849
01:13:32,343 --> 01:13:35,039
It's all comin' back
to me now.

850
01:13:35,079 --> 01:13:37,946
I was just a tiny bit
fucked up that night.

851
01:13:37,982 --> 01:13:39,040
Kenny!.

852
01:13:39,083 --> 01:13:41,051
Oh, I gotta get that order.

853
01:13:42,387 --> 01:13:45,914
Do you want
anything to drink?.

854
01:13:47,625 --> 01:13:50,253
Yeah...
Cafe is good, yeah.

855
01:13:50,294 --> 01:13:51,488
OK.

856
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:44,941
[phone ringing]

857
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:51,948
Norma, I need you to listen
to a message for me.

858
01:14:51,989 --> 01:14:54,082
Honey, I'm gonna
drink this glass of vino,

859
01:14:54,125 --> 01:14:56,025
and I've gotta run outta' here.

860
01:15:00,998 --> 01:15:02,556
Please, Norma.

861
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,795
All right, dial her up, quickly.

862
01:15:05,636 --> 01:15:08,036
And you can open up that
other bottle of vino, OK?.

863
01:15:08,072 --> 01:15:09,835
No, I prefer the nummy.

864
01:15:11,109 --> 01:15:15,739
(voice on phone)
Hey Jérôme.
You got the pizza gig.

865
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:17,645
Jérome!

866
01:15:17,682 --> 01:15:19,479
- That's--
- Yeah, I know.

867
01:15:19,517 --> 01:15:21,007
That's incredible!

868
01:15:21,419 --> 01:15:24,718
You've only been here a week.
This doesn't happen to people.

869
01:15:24,755 --> 01:15:26,450
Yeah, I understand.

870
01:15:26,491 --> 01:15:27,719
So what's the problem?.

871
01:15:27,758 --> 01:15:30,283
She said she needs
my address, my--

872
01:15:30,328 --> 01:15:33,957
Your social
or your taxpayer lD.

873
01:15:34,699 --> 01:15:37,361
Listen, I gotta' get
to bingo, all right?.

874
01:15:37,401 --> 01:15:38,834
We'll figure it out
on the way over there.

875
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:40,167
You're going to
come with me, OK?.

876
01:15:43,841 --> 01:15:45,672
I've been waiting
over here for 30 minutes!

877
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:47,439
Where's my
replacement bus at?.

878
01:15:47,478 --> 01:15:49,309
Yeah, ain't the bus fixed yet?.

879
01:15:49,347 --> 01:15:51,144
This girl's gotta go to work.

880
01:15:52,049 --> 01:15:53,209
You know what?.

881
01:15:53,251 --> 01:15:54,878
About that Walter
Norris Agency...

882
01:15:54,919 --> 01:15:56,614
Just tell them your situation.

883
01:15:56,654 --> 01:15:59,646
Everything's gonna be just fine.
It really will.

884
01:15:59,690 --> 01:16:00,588
Faggots!

885
01:16:00,625 --> 01:16:01,853
Good eye!

886
01:16:02,426 --> 01:16:03,552
God!

887
01:16:03,594 --> 01:16:05,687
But if she says,
"You're not legal?. "

888
01:16:07,064 --> 01:16:09,794
Jérome, it's not like you
just stormed over the border

889
01:16:09,834 --> 01:16:12,667
from El Salvador or anything.

890
01:16:14,939 --> 01:16:17,533
Besides, you can
use my address.

891
01:16:17,575 --> 01:16:18,599
What?.

892
01:16:18,643 --> 01:16:22,044
I have an idea!
You could use my identity.

893
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:25,048
I'm a lapsed member of SAG.

894
01:16:25,082 --> 01:16:27,778
But then you'll belong to me,

895
01:16:27,818 --> 01:16:30,548
'cause all your checks and
residuals will come in my name.

896
01:16:31,656 --> 01:16:33,817
When's the bus
gonna' be ready?.

897
01:16:44,635 --> 01:16:46,398
G-57.

898
01:16:47,138 --> 01:16:48,400
BlNGO!

899
01:16:48,806 --> 01:16:51,138
We got us a Bingo!
Come on up here!

900
01:16:51,175 --> 01:16:53,302
There you go
and what's your name, dear?.

901
01:16:53,344 --> 01:16:54,140
I'm Dale.

902
01:16:54,178 --> 01:16:55,975
You're Dale.
Where you from, Dale?.

903
01:16:56,013 --> 01:16:57,071
I'm from New Jersey.

904
01:16:57,114 --> 01:16:58,604
New Jersey, oy.

905
01:16:58,649 --> 01:17:00,583
Dale, what are you doing
out here in Hollywood?.

906
01:17:00,618 --> 01:17:02,848
- I'm an actor.
- An actor.

907
01:17:03,955 --> 01:17:05,013
It's good, Norma.

908
01:17:05,056 --> 01:17:05,886
It's good.

909
01:17:05,923 --> 01:17:08,289
Let's see, what did you win?.
Let's see here.

910
01:17:08,326 --> 01:17:10,419
Oh! Dale!

911
01:17:10,461 --> 01:17:11,894
You've done won yourself

912
01:17:11,929 --> 01:17:15,922
a battery-operated anal wand
from the Pleasure Chest!

913
01:17:18,369 --> 01:17:21,304
Take that home,
and if you need a little hand,

914
01:17:21,339 --> 01:17:23,500
Norma's here to help you.

915
01:17:24,609 --> 01:17:27,305
Oh, my God. Look at this.

916
01:17:27,345 --> 01:17:31,577
There's so many actors
and actresses here tonight.

917
01:17:31,616 --> 01:17:34,881
And some of them
are even workin'.

918
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:17,355
Jérome! Jérome!

919
01:18:19,196 --> 01:18:20,527
What's up?.

920
01:18:20,564 --> 01:18:22,225
You should have called me;
I would have taken you.

921
01:18:22,266 --> 01:18:23,824
No, it's OK.

922
01:18:23,868 --> 01:18:26,462
I took the Rapid Bus
and it's not too bad.

923
01:18:26,504 --> 01:18:27,937
Hey, I talked to Sarah.

924
01:18:27,972 --> 01:18:29,633
She told me
you got that commercial.

925
01:18:29,674 --> 01:18:30,834
That's incredible.

926
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:32,172
Yeah.

927
01:18:32,209 --> 01:18:33,938
You shoot tomorrow, right?.

928
01:18:33,978 --> 01:18:35,673
Tomorrow, yeah.

929
01:18:35,713 --> 01:18:36,839
She also told me that

930
01:18:36,881 --> 01:18:39,748
your real name is Norman
and that you're American?.

931
01:18:39,784 --> 01:18:41,251
Ah, yeah.

932
01:18:41,285 --> 01:18:42,946
Whatever works, man.

933
01:19:47,284 --> 01:19:48,808
You talent?.

934
01:19:48,853 --> 01:19:50,013
I'm looking for--

935
01:19:50,054 --> 01:19:51,282
Yeah, we spoke last night
on the phone.

936
01:19:51,322 --> 01:19:52,619
I'm Jen, 2nd AD.

937
01:19:52,656 --> 01:19:53,987
I am Jérome.

938
01:19:54,024 --> 01:19:55,514
Jérome?.

939
01:19:55,559 --> 01:19:58,858
But my legal name is Norman,
Norman Belcher.

940
01:19:58,896 --> 01:20:01,456
Right, Norman Belcher.

941
01:20:01,499 --> 01:20:02,898
You're playing
the boyfriend, right?.

942
01:20:02,933 --> 01:20:04,730
Yeah, yeah.

943
01:20:04,769 --> 01:20:07,795
Would you prefer
I call you Jérome?.

944
01:20:07,838 --> 01:20:10,136
Oh, no.
Norman is good, yeah.

945
01:20:10,174 --> 01:20:11,505
All right.

946
01:20:11,542 --> 01:20:12,770
All right, Norman,

947
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:15,779
I'm just gonna
sign you in here.

948
01:20:16,981 --> 01:20:20,473
Anyone ever tell you
you look like Adrien Brody?.

949
01:20:20,518 --> 01:20:22,179
No.

950
01:20:23,587 --> 01:20:27,148
All right, we've got
a few shots before yours.

951
01:20:27,191 --> 01:20:29,557
So, you've got some time
to hang out.

952
01:20:29,593 --> 01:20:30,924
Follow me.

953
01:20:32,263 --> 01:20:35,391
There's makeup,
wardrobe is just down the way.

954
01:20:35,433 --> 01:20:36,593
There's breakfast now,

955
01:20:36,634 --> 01:20:38,124
but there'll be
craft services all day.

956
01:20:38,169 --> 01:20:40,899
So please have
as much as you like.

957
01:20:40,938 --> 01:20:43,873
And...this is your trailer.

958
01:20:43,908 --> 01:20:46,069
So after you're done
with breakfast

959
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:47,042
and wardrobe and makeup,

960
01:20:47,077 --> 01:20:49,204
then you can just
hang out here. Yeah?.

961
01:20:49,246 --> 01:20:50,577
- OK.
- Good.

962
01:20:54,351 --> 01:20:56,649
Norman Belcher.

963
01:21:35,559 --> 01:21:36,924
[knock on door]

964
01:21:36,961 --> 01:21:38,155
Yeah?.

965
01:21:38,195 --> 01:21:40,060
Norman, they're ready for you.

966
01:21:45,169 --> 01:21:47,160
Rolling, take 3.

967
01:21:47,204 --> 01:21:49,468
And, action!

968
01:22:01,418 --> 01:22:02,680
Cut!

969
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,415
And we're moving on.

970
01:22:05,189 --> 01:22:06,850
Take five.
Rolling.

971
01:22:06,891 --> 01:22:09,451
And, action!

972
01:22:28,812 --> 01:22:29,904
And, cut!

973
01:22:29,947 --> 01:22:31,346
Going again, right away.

974
01:22:41,492 --> 01:22:42,959
Also right, there.

975
01:22:45,496 --> 01:22:47,521
That's all I need.
Thanks!

976
01:22:48,532 --> 01:22:51,399
It was really great
working with you.

977
01:22:52,469 --> 01:22:53,629
Let's keep in touch.

978
01:22:54,905 --> 01:22:55,963
And Norman,

979
01:22:56,006 --> 01:22:58,634
I'll just get a final
John Hancock from you,

980
01:22:58,676 --> 01:23:01,338
and then you are good to go.

981
01:23:04,114 --> 01:23:05,979
Can I get a copy?.

982
01:23:06,016 --> 01:23:07,483
Call the production company
in a few weeks.

983
01:23:07,518 --> 01:23:09,213
They should be able
to help you out with that.

984
01:23:09,253 --> 01:23:10,618
Is there anything else?.

985
01:23:10,654 --> 01:23:12,815
Nope. That's all I need.

986
01:23:16,927 --> 01:23:19,395
Welcome to Hollywood, Jérome!

987
01:23:39,516 --> 01:23:41,143
Good morning, sunshine.

988
01:23:49,226 --> 01:23:51,251
Hey, have you
heard from Kaleesha?.

989
01:23:51,729 --> 01:23:53,492
You have tried to call her?.

990
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:55,760
Well, she hasn't answered
her phone in two days,

991
01:23:55,799 --> 01:23:58,427
and she's got me worried sick.

992
01:24:00,471 --> 01:24:03,235
It's OK, she's always
come back, no?.

993
01:24:05,309 --> 01:24:07,470
How'd your commercial shoot go?.

994
01:24:07,511 --> 01:24:09,411
Oh, it was boring, in fact.

995
01:24:09,446 --> 01:24:11,277
- Oh, yeah?.
- Yeah.

996
01:24:11,315 --> 01:24:17,117
I don't believe it will be
a good commercial for pizza.

997
01:24:17,154 --> 01:24:20,248
Well, you'll, you'll have to
tell me about it later.

998
01:24:21,425 --> 01:24:23,950
It's funny...

999
01:24:23,994 --> 01:24:26,724
When the weather
is beautiful all the time,

1000
01:24:26,764 --> 01:24:28,254
it's no longer special.

1001
01:25:05,669 --> 01:25:08,502
Oh, Eugenio,
this is Jérome.

1002
01:25:08,539 --> 01:25:10,666
He's replacing Arturo.

1003
01:25:10,708 --> 01:25:12,005
- Hola!
- Hello.

1004
01:25:12,042 --> 01:25:14,840
So if you have any questions,
just ask Eugenio.

1005
01:25:14,878 --> 01:25:16,436
He's the best.

1006
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:17,674
Thank you.

1007
01:25:39,636 --> 01:25:41,035
Hey, I'm not done with that.

1008
01:25:41,638 --> 01:25:43,799
Oh, my God!

1009
01:25:43,841 --> 01:25:45,274
I'm sorry.
It was an accident!

1010
01:25:45,309 --> 01:25:46,503
What is wrong with you?.

1011
01:25:46,543 --> 01:25:48,135
Look what you've done
to my dress!

1012
01:25:48,178 --> 01:25:50,669
I need to see
a manager immediately!

1013
01:25:50,714 --> 01:25:52,477
This is unbelievable!
I am never...

1014
01:25:53,083 --> 01:25:54,607
Why are you
laughing at me?.

1015
01:25:59,156 --> 01:26:00,885
- Eugenio?.
- Uh huh?.

1016
01:26:01,425 --> 01:26:04,087
Thank you for your help earlier
with the waiter.

1017
01:26:05,162 --> 01:26:06,754
That was funny.

1018
01:26:06,797 --> 01:26:08,492
It's not a problem, man.

1019
01:26:09,366 --> 01:26:12,597
You have done
this job for how long?.

1020
01:26:12,636 --> 01:26:14,103
Oh, this job?.

1021
01:26:14,138 --> 01:26:15,901
Like four years.

1022
01:26:16,006 --> 01:26:18,497
- Four years?.
- Uh huh.

1023
01:26:18,542 --> 01:26:22,603
But Ms. Lise, she say
one day soon I can be a server.

1024
01:27:04,121 --> 01:27:05,520
[knock on door]

1025
01:27:05,556 --> 01:27:06,682
Yes?.

1026
01:27:10,394 --> 01:27:12,862
Good morning, Norma.
How are you?.

1027
01:27:14,097 --> 01:27:15,894
Well, I was gonna
come in here

1028
01:27:15,933 --> 01:27:17,924
and yell at you
for using my computer, but--

1029
01:27:17,968 --> 01:27:21,768
Yeah, yeah.
I go back to Paris today.

1030
01:27:24,041 --> 01:27:25,633
But I thought that
you didn't have any money

1031
01:27:25,676 --> 01:27:27,871
and that you wanted to stay.

1032
01:27:29,179 --> 01:27:32,342
I already bought the ticket;
It was a round trip.

1033
01:27:36,653 --> 01:27:38,644
After everything
that I have done for you,

1034
01:27:38,689 --> 01:27:41,988
and Kaleesha is
nowhere to be found...

1035
01:27:42,025 --> 01:27:44,357
She's not going with you,
is she?.

1036
01:27:44,394 --> 01:27:46,453
I don't know where is Kaleesha.

1037
01:27:49,132 --> 01:27:51,692
Tomorrow is New Year's Eve.

1038
01:27:52,536 --> 01:27:54,163
What about your acting career?.

1039
01:27:57,541 --> 01:28:00,374
You said from the start
it was temporary.

1040
01:28:02,379 --> 01:28:03,812
It always is.

1041
01:28:19,463 --> 01:28:20,555
Thank you, Norma.

1042
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,461
Read my letter.

1043
01:28:55,666 --> 01:28:57,657
[laughing]

1044
01:28:57,701 --> 01:28:59,601
Release your soul...

1045
01:28:59,636 --> 01:29:01,160
Release.

1046
01:29:12,649 --> 01:29:14,776
Hello. I know you.

1047
01:29:16,653 --> 01:29:19,986
I meet you
at Spotlight, Hollywood.

1048
01:29:20,023 --> 01:29:21,422
Nah, man.
I'm sorry.

1049
01:29:21,458 --> 01:29:23,756
I think you've mistaken me
for somebody else

1050
01:29:33,603 --> 01:29:34,865
Jérome?.

1051
01:29:34,905 --> 01:29:36,133
Ah, Ross.

1052
01:29:36,173 --> 01:29:37,538
Hey, what's up?.

1053
01:29:37,574 --> 01:29:39,337
I was coming to see you.

1054
01:29:39,543 --> 01:29:42,068
Is that my new star client,
Norman/Jérome?.

1055
01:29:42,746 --> 01:29:44,646
I have big plans
for you, sweetheart.

1056
01:29:44,681 --> 01:29:47,149
We're gonna have you
on a soap by Valentine's Day.

1057
01:29:47,184 --> 01:29:48,412
See you later.

1058
01:29:49,453 --> 01:29:51,318
You going somewhere?.

1059
01:29:52,556 --> 01:29:54,421
My plane leaves in four hours.

1060
01:29:55,826 --> 01:29:56,952
Paris?.

1061
01:29:56,994 --> 01:29:58,723
Yes, Paris, yeah.

1062
01:30:00,897 --> 01:30:02,956
You comin' back?.

1063
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,491
I don't know. Maybe.

1064
01:30:11,341 --> 01:30:13,707
We can smoke together
before I go?.

1065
01:30:16,246 --> 01:30:19,147
Yeah, of course.

1066
01:30:20,050 --> 01:30:21,347
Come on.
I'll give you a ride.

1067
01:30:48,111 --> 01:30:50,602
Dear Norma,

1068
01:30:50,647 --> 01:30:52,410
It is difficult for me
to say goodbye

1069
01:30:52,449 --> 01:30:55,748
because a big part of me doesn't
want to leave Los Angeles.

1070
01:30:58,088 --> 01:31:01,057
But I am no longer sure
this life is for me.

1071
01:31:04,194 --> 01:31:07,789
And besides, I still have
some attachments in France.

1072
01:31:11,601 --> 01:31:13,592
My decision to return
is not a rejection

1073
01:31:13,637 --> 01:31:14,968
of you or Kaleesha,

1074
01:31:15,005 --> 01:31:17,940
or the idyllic life
in Silverlake.

1075
01:31:17,974 --> 01:31:20,807
I will always remember
our Christmas together,

1076
01:31:20,844 --> 01:31:23,210
and I thank you
for letting me stay with you.

1077
01:32:15,031 --> 01:32:18,125
You can keep all the money
from the pizza commercial.

1078
01:32:18,168 --> 01:32:21,228
It is in your name
and I owe it to you.

1079
01:32:26,743 --> 01:32:28,040
If I return to Hollywood,

1080
01:32:28,078 --> 01:32:30,512
I will contact you immediately,
of course.

1081
01:32:42,058 --> 01:32:44,618
But I still love someone
in Paris.

1082
01:32:44,661 --> 01:32:47,255
And it will always
be my home.

1083
01:32:48,598 --> 01:32:50,566
I hope you understand.

1084
01:33:05,682 --> 01:33:07,445
Please give Kaleesha
the bedroom

1085
01:33:07,484 --> 01:33:09,714
so she will
stay off the streets.

1086
01:33:17,627 --> 01:33:20,323
I wish you both
a Happy New Year's.

1087
01:33:20,363 --> 01:33:22,593
Hollywood, je t'aime...

1088
01:33:24,434 --> 01:33:25,992
