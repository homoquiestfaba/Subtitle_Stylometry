00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,333
- [Frank] Larry, Larry, you okay?

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:27,487
Come on, buddy, talk to
me, Larry, oh my God.

4
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,086
Larry?

5
00:00:30,086 --> 00:00:31,060
- [Buddy] What happened, Frank?

6
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,963
- [Frank] Hey, Buddy, look at me, come on.

7
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:36,110
- [Carrie] Oh, God, he's not breathing.

8
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,550
Go call the paramedics.

9
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,080
- [Frank] Let me get you over here.

10
00:00:40,227 --> 00:00:42,327
Larry, talk to me--
- Stay here, I'll go.

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,002
- [Paramedic] Hold his
neck steady, I got him.

12
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:50,335
(ambulance siren wails)

13
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,275
Watch your back, nurse, coming through.

14
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:08,719
- [Doctor] What happened to this guy?

15
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,339
- [Paramedic] Motorcycle,
he broke his neck.

16
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:13,172
- [Receptionist] Mr. Mailer?

17
00:01:13,172 --> 00:01:14,005
- [Mr. Mailer] Yes?

18
00:01:14,005 --> 00:01:14,838
- [Receptionist] The
doctor wants to see you.

19
00:01:14,838 --> 00:01:15,671
- [Dr. Mailer] All right.

20
00:01:15,671 --> 00:01:16,504
- What happened, Frankie?

21
00:01:16,504 --> 00:01:18,140
All's they said was he
took a spill on the bike,

22
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,030
- Well, the fall didn't seem
that bad when it happened,

23
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,050
but then, that's all I know, really.

24
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,715
- Let me see what I can
find out here, ma'am?

25
00:01:25,715 --> 00:01:26,746
- [Receptionist] Yes?

26
00:01:26,746 --> 00:01:30,421
- [James] We're looking
for our son, Larry McAfee.

27
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:31,838
- [Amelia] Larry?

28
00:01:34,045 --> 00:01:35,128
Larry, Larry?

29
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:38,754
Larry.

30
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,320
- Larry, I'm Ben Greene
from physical medicine.

31
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,070
The medical staff's about
ready to hand you over to me.

32
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,490
- When do I get out of here?

33
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,923
- Well, you've got about 10
months of therapy ahead of you.

34
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,910
Larry, you'll be getting out of here,

35
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,710
but you won't be getting any better.

36
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,263
You're a C2, it's a high quadriplegic,

37
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,480
and that means paralysis
from the neck down.

38
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,513
- But how?

39
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:37,963
How am I gonna?

40
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,810
- That means a ventilator like this,

41
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,520
for the rest of your life.

00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:48,248

Larry, did you get her number?

88

00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,693

91
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,590
I play things over in
my head, football games

92
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:39,283

Times with Charlene.

94
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:47,449
Or Linda.

00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,163
Or Marilee.

00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,093

00:06:54,022 --> 00:06:55,686
The redhead?

98
00:06:55,686 --> 00:07:00,640
The one with the cashmere
sweaters, hmm, Marilee.

99
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,473
- Yeah.

100
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,253
I replay it all, man.

101
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,770
Especially the picnic.

102
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,363

103
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,923
Carrie Hadley.

104
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,693
And I still got her number
in the pocket of my jeans.

105
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,863
Hey, Frank?

106
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,680
You want to tell me something?

107
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,870
(Frank laughs)

108
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,703
- Yeah.

109
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,377
I'm getting married, Larry.

110
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,660
- Is that why you're so depressed, you.

111
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,313
I hear it's got its good points.

112
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,393
Regular sex, for one.

113
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,520
You remember how much we used to think

114
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,720
about Marilee when we
were in seventh grade?

115
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,913
Dancing close with her,
feeling that soft sweater.

116
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,810
Hell, we never did
anything, but we thought

117
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,060
about her all the time.

118
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,893
- Yeah.

119
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,893
- In my ward, there's a,

120
00:08:27,217 --> 00:08:29,770
there's this one nurse in particular.

121
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,460
Hold out your hands.

122
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,580
More.
(Frank laughs)

123
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,023
- You are shameless.

124
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,430
- You getting married back home?

125
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,263
- Yeah.

126
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,500
We were hoping you could come down.

127
00:09:00,672 --> 00:09:02,472
- I don't know where I'll be, Frank.

128
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,930
My insurance money's run out.

129
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,923
- Larry, that was worth a million dollars.

130
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,800
- Breathing is a very expensive habit.

131
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,673
Texas.

132
00:09:23,612 --> 00:09:26,660
I don't want to go to Texas, I want,

133
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,960
I want to stay in Georgia.

134
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,143
- Georgia don't want you,
it's as simple as that.

135
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,863
- But I,

136
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,630
I pay taxes, I've got rights, dammit.

137
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,940
I'm gonna do something.

138
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,290
- Larry--
- About this, they can't--

139
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,123
- Larry.

140
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,220
There's a level of care that you need

141

142
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,253
Now, this place in Texas

- It's not the middle of the night,

179
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,730
Mr. McAfee, you're disoriented.

180
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,610
- [Larry] What the hell time is it?

181
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,443
- Bath time.

182
00:12:26,357 --> 00:12:29,310
- I don't know what
they're giving me, Dad.

183
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,460
I can't think straight.

184
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,683
- So I understand you called
the state, what did they say?

185
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,080
They told you we had the right

186
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,863
to terminate your care, anytime, right?

187
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,550
Maybe you'll cooperate from now on.

188
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,083
- Maybe pigs will fly.

189
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,070
And maybe you'll pull your head out--

190
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,763
- All right, that's it.

191
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,653
You're nothing but trouble,
McAfee, pack your things.

192
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,210
- McAfee, they sent him over from Texas.

193
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,940
- Oh, yeah, McAfee, excuse me.

194
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,100
Bed three, over here,
10 minutes per visit.

195
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,870
- Well, why is he in intensive
care, what's happened to him?

196
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,363
- Nothing, we're just the
only place with a ventilator.

197
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,090
- They just dumped me here, Mom.

198
00:13:37,582 --> 00:13:40,383
God, I don't have my clothes, my pictures.

199
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,300
- [Amelia] Your daddy
will be here tomorrow

200
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,100
and we'll figure out a way
to get you out of this place.

201
00:13:48,117 --> 00:13:49,773
- This place, that place.

202
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,673
My life is hell, it really doesn't matter

203
00:13:53,673 --> 00:13:56,553
which corner of hell they park me in.

204
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,473
- People like us don't give up.

205
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,173
- Mom, I'm not a person anymore.

206
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,433
I can't live like this.
(slow piano music)

207
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,313
- Excuse me, Larry McAfee?

208
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,583
- McAfee?

209
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,153
There.

210
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,223
- Thank you.

211
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:51,223
Mr. McAfee?

212
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,963
I'm Randy Davis.

213
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,440
- I didn't know you were coming today.

214
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,590
- I tried to telephone.

215
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,940
- Telephone's are privilege around here.

216
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,650
The jailers don't give them to bad boys.

217
00:15:13,722 --> 00:15:15,022
- Have you been a bad boy?

218
00:15:16,643 --> 00:15:18,843
- I did the worst thing
I could possibly do.

219
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,833
- What's that?

220
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:23,453
- I asked for a lawyer.

221
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,383
- Well, here I am, your
friend Frank called me.

222
00:15:31,712 --> 00:15:32,545
- Help me up.

223
00:15:36,705 --> 00:15:37,788
- Right here?

224
00:15:45,174 --> 00:15:46,341
- That's good.

225
00:15:49,267 --> 00:15:51,530
Did he tell you what I want?

226
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,880
- Yes, he did, but I'd
rather hear it from you.

227
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,430
You're gonna have to tell
a whole lot of people,

228
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,480
one way or the other.

229
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,890
- Then I'll tell them.

230
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,640
I don't know if people want to listen.

231
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,460
People like their horror
stories nice and tidy, you know?

232
00:16:15,502 --> 00:16:16,335
Well, they saved me,

233
00:16:16,335 --> 00:16:19,843
but then they tell me this
is how I have to live.

234
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:25,400
Well, it's been four years
since I had my accident,

235
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:30,233
and in that time, I've tried,
I really have tried to adjust

236
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,083
to this.

237
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,093
But I can't.

238
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:44,890
Right now, I just, I want to end it.

239
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,330
Turn off this damn machine
that breathes for me

240
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,550
and go back to where I was, on the side

241
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,563
of that mountain road, and just die,

242
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,000
like I damn well should have.

243
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,050
- Do you consider it suicide?

244
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,783
- The ventilator is unnatural,
I just want to take it away.

245
00:17:07,713 --> 00:17:09,210
- To be more precise,
you want someone else

246
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,570
to take it away for you.

247
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:15,540
- No, no, I've designed a switch
that I can activate myself.

248
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,950
- You designed it?

249
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,613
- I designed it, yes.

250
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:25,563
I'm a mechanical engineer,
mister, I'm not brain dead.

251
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,613
Yet.

252
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:36,403
What I can't do myself is
build it or install it.

253
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,040
I need help with that part.

254
00:17:40,896 --> 00:17:42,830
And that person who helps
needs to be protected

255
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,450
from criminal charges.

256
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,893
- I understand, may I speak frankly?

257
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,250
Your friend Frank warned
me, and now I can see it

258
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,643
for myself, you've got
quite a mouth on you.

259
00:17:55,643 --> 00:17:57,543
- It's the only part that survived.

260
00:18:02,883 --> 00:18:04,913
- If I take this case, I intend to win it.

261
00:18:06,008 --> 00:18:07,590
The only way I can do that is if you learn

262
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,703
to control your anger and your tongue.

263
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,113
- I can do it.

264
00:18:19,894 --> 00:18:21,790
- You have a mother and
a father, is that right?

265
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,883
- Yes, and I've talked to them about this.

266
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,583
- So will I.

267
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,563
- They want what I want.

268
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:35,903
- So do I.

269
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,280
- This is "The Fine Line,"
Birmingham's premier 120 minutes

270
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,890
of talk issues and bombast,
my name is Russ Fine,

271
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:52,000
and in our studio today is
the lovely Elizabeth Garland,

272
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,560
a member of the Universal Pro Life League.

273
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,420
Liz's group is more than against abortion,

274
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,670
they are also dedicated
to the preservation

275
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:04,005
and creation of life everywhere,
is that about right, Liz?

276
00:19:04,005 --> 00:19:06,680
- The life force should
never be squandered.

277
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,200
- Well, for those of you just tuning in,

278
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,380
I've already talked to
Liz about mosquitoes

279
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,670
and Gila monsters, and she believes

280
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:17,160
that they should be fruitful
and multiply, as well.

281
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,870
So this sounds hot, let's
get those phones going.

282
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,890
Don't ask me, talk to
her, we have some calls,

283
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:27,460
let's go now to caller, yes,
you are on "The Fine Line."

284
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,340
- [Caller] Do you think birds
are reincarnated people?

285
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:33,680
- No, I'm a Christian,
but I have great respect

286
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,910
for the Jains and other
rural sects of India,

287
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:40,189
for whom reincarnation is essential to--

288
00:19:40,189 --> 00:19:41,564
- We do not have an audience

289
00:19:41,564 --> 00:19:43,210
in India, Liz, and unfortunately,

290
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:45,400
we don't have any
advertisers there, either.

291
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,400
So we'll have to take
another call, this one from?

292
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,330
- Atlanta.

293
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,640
- Atlanta, Georgia, home
of the Georgia peach.

294
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,240
You are on "The Fine Line."

295
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,590
- [Caller] Hey, what
about somebody who wants

296
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,470
to kill themself, like this McAfee guy?

297
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,160
He's got a pretty damn good reason,

298
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,044
and it'll save us taxpayers a bundle.

299
00:20:01,044 --> 00:20:01,990
- Hey, now, wait a minute, I was

300
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,810
with you there up until the end.

301
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,290
Larry McAfee, for those
of you who don't know,

302
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,920
is a motorcycle accident
victim, a quadriplegic,

303
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,980
who has petitioned the state
of Georgia for the right--

304
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,017
- Listen, Mr. McAfee.

305
00:20:14,017 --> 00:20:15,050
- [Russ] To kill himself.

306
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,173
- You're on the radio.

307
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,006
- [Caller] Oh, come on, Russ.

308
00:20:17,006 --> 00:20:17,970
- The hell I am.

309
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,727
- Are they talking about you?

310
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:21,020
- [Caller] Now, I don't see why

311
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,260
my tax dollars should be
spent to keep this guy alive.

312
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,810
This government's doing
nothing but spending my money.

313
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,250
First they bail out the SNLs,

314
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,700
then they're bailing out the Arabs.

315
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,954
It's just Big Brother, if you ask me.

316
00:20:31,954 --> 00:20:33,160
- Who asked you?

317
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,110
- [Caller] I'm sicked and tired of it.

318
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,256
- Why don't you take your tax money,

319
00:20:36,256 --> 00:20:39,340
buy yourself another
six pack, get yourself

320
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,090
in your pickup truck,
break your own damn neck,

321
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,810
and then come to me and holler

322
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:48,890
about how Big Brother
is helping the disabled.

323
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:53,890
This is Russ Fine, have
a good Birmingham night.

324
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,430
- [Radio Announcer] In Tuscaloosa,

325
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,460
the temperature's around 88 degrees.

326
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,560
In Montgomery, it's 84
degrees in our state capital,

327
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,660
and in Mobile and Biloxi, near 93 is--

328
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,967
- Where the hell did you dig her up?

329
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,890
- You asked for her, you wanted

330
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,530
to broaden the pro-life audience.

331
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,010
- Hell, I didn't want to include India

332
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,030
and the Insects First League.

333
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:20,140
- [Radio Announcer] 84
degrees in our state capital.

334
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,065
- Now, this is the kind of
stuff we should be going after.

335
00:21:23,065 --> 00:21:24,620
This is real.

336
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,690
- I'll try and set it up.

337
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,680
- [Radio Announcer] Now,
unseasonably cool air will

338
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,153
once again cover the
northern tier of the state.

339
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,703
- I cannot believe the
cruelty of these people.

340
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,653
Just as soon as he files his case,

341
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,023
ship him off to Alabama.

342
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:51,130
Sell his contract, they
said, just like before,

343
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,653
just like Texas.

344
00:21:55,205 --> 00:21:57,763
Just like he was a sack
of rotten potatoes.

345
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,343
- I talked to Larry's lawyer.

346
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,070
He's gonna get the judge to
hold the hearing right there

347
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:09,907
in the hospital, before they can move him.

348
00:22:23,153 --> 00:22:25,830
- Hey, Judge Johnson has
agreed to come here today

349
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,890
in advance of your hearing
because you're being transported

350
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,013
to Alabama against your will.

351
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,630
There may not be a second chance.

352
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,660
- Thank you, your honor.

353
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,380
- Mr. McAfee, what was your work

354
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:43,380
before your motorcycle
accident, on May 5th, 1987?

355
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,703
- I was an engineering projects manager.

356
00:22:50,526 --> 00:22:52,230
- [Judge Johnson] And what did you like

357
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,923
to do for recreation?

358
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,113
- Be outside,

359
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,883
anything outdoors.

360
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,803
Hunting, fishing, golf, skiing,

361
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,553
running.

362
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,350
Couldn't wait to get outside.

363
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,860
- How often do you go outside now?

364
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,693
- Hardly ever.

365
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:18,200
- Mr. McAfee, I'd like to
quote from your deposition.

366
00:23:19,577 --> 00:23:23,113
"I've been rendered helpless
and without enjoyment in life.

367
00:23:23,957 --> 00:23:26,267
"It is my sincere wish that I be allowed

368
00:23:26,267 --> 00:23:28,337
"to terminate my medical treatment

369
00:23:28,337 --> 00:23:31,247
"by orally activating a switch

370
00:23:31,247 --> 00:23:33,667
"that will turn the ventilator off."

371
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,973
Is that a true indication of your wishes?

372
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:42,003
- You get to the point where you realize,

373
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,323
this is your life,

374
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,010
and in my case, it's

375
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,590
ceased to be worth living.

376
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,593
- Mr. McAfee, since your accident,

377
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:01,083
have you found any moments
of joy in your life?

378
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,990
Perhaps some time with your family,

379
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:07,053
or even a day in the outdoors?

380
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,043
- Yes, a few times.

381
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,963
- And at those times, did
you want to kill yourself?

382
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,180
- Maybe not right then, but--

383
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:26,583
- But now, at this moment, you want to?

384
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,313
Which are we to believe is
your permanent state of mind?

385
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,653
- Permanent?

386
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,083
You ask me that?

387
00:24:37,965 --> 00:24:39,715
What the hell do you know about it?

388
00:24:41,195 --> 00:24:44,230
Now, you can walk out that
door back to your office

389
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,423
with the big window.

390
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:50,913
You can change your designer
suits all by yourself.

391
00:24:51,878 --> 00:24:56,540
You can decide how fast you
breathe, for God's sake.

392
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,910
Don't you dare

393
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,133
ask me about permanent, I know permanent.

394
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,477
And I am the resident
expert here on permanent.

395
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:23,983
- Sir, this is the switch.

396
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,263
- Excuse me.

397
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:33,270
And Mr. McAfee designed this device

398
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:36,170
so that he could throw it himself, without

399
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,090
setting off the alarms that
are built into the ventilator?

400
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:44,223
- That's right, your honor,
nobody will know except Larry.

401
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,913
- I support his decision.

402
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:57,893
And I.

403
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:06,743
I'm sorry.

404
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,660
- It's all right, Mr. McAfee.

405
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:19,833
- It was the hardest thing I've
ever had to do, your honor.

406
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,593
To give up my boy,

407
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:27,923
to have him ask,

408
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,690
and have me

409
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,123
to say yes,

410
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,860
but I am convinced

411
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,663
it's what he wants.

412
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:53,403
And I do believe he is
going to a better place.

413
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,493
- [James] Your honor, I'd
like to say something.

414
00:26:58,422 --> 00:26:59,422
- Certainly.

415
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:04,513
- There's a state prison
not far from my home.

416
00:27:08,053 --> 00:27:09,183
And in there,

417
00:27:10,886 --> 00:27:11,719
a killer.

418
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,913
They

419
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,330
are paid to work,

420
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:20,713
and to go to school.

421
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,870
Larry ain't never broke a law in his life,

422
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,990
but all the state can find for him is a.

423
00:27:34,507 --> 00:27:37,424
(slow piano music)

424
00:27:38,537 --> 00:27:42,983
And I live in Georgia, I was born here.

425
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,193
I've never carried a protest sign,

426
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:49,013
I always paid my taxes.

427
00:27:51,008 --> 00:27:52,653
But the state has betrayed me.

428
00:27:56,977 --> 00:27:58,394
Me and my family.

429
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:04,790
And next time, I reckon maybe
I just won't pay my taxes.

430
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:09,453
They go ahead on throwing
me in jail if they want to,

431
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,780
just so they make the cell big enough

432
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,443
for me to take care of my boy.

433
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,113
- Mr. and Mrs. McAfee,

434
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,560
I think your son is a
very courageous young man

435
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,223
from a very courageous family.

436
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,310
I've been moved

437
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:49,313
by what has obviously
been a terrible struggle,

438
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,313
which no family should have to endure.

439
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,320
Because of the ramifications,
this has been one

440
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,300
of the most difficult decisions I've had

441
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,513
to make on the bench.

442
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:09,663
I hereby grant his request
that a switch be installed,

443
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,730
which he can operate independently

444
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,080
to shut off the ventilator.

445
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:21,470
If there is a death, it will be a result

446
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:25,553
of the original injury,
and not self inflicted.

447
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,263
I wish you all the best.

448
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,710
- The really shocking thing

449
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,670
about this case is the message the state

450
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:45,042
of Georgia's sending to
its disabled citizens.

451
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:46,610
- [Audience Member] That's right.

452
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,783
- We won't pay for you to
have a decent, hopeful life.

453
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,050
We won't help you find a
way to live independently,

454
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:57,973
to earn a salary, to contribute.

455
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:02,583
The court will, however,
offer another solution,

456
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:08,930
the easy solution, the one
that gets you off our hands

457
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,973
and off our books.

458
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:15,483
And one more thing.

459
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,393
We will be watching
this case very closely.

460
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:24,410
Anyone who assists in McAfee's
suicide had better have

461
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:28,423
his ducks all in a row, or
he will be facing charges.

462
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,020
- What are your plans?

463
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:35,933
- Well, I thought I'd spend
one more Easter with my family.

464
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,050
- One final piece of advice,
we won the decision today,

465
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:44,046
but tomorrow, someone
may challenge the ruling,

466
00:30:44,046 --> 00:30:45,730
and Georgia's Supreme
Court reversal would put

467
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,580
you right back where you were before.

468
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,330
- So what you're saying
is don't wait too long.

469
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,163
- That's right.

470
00:30:54,515 --> 00:30:59,515
- I understand, thank you.
(slow piano music)

471
00:31:22,944 --> 00:31:25,861
(slow piano music)

472
00:31:43,553 --> 00:31:47,053
(overlapping chattering)

473
00:31:47,053 --> 00:31:48,037
- Hi, may I help you?

474
00:31:48,037 --> 00:31:51,835
- I'm Dr. Fine, I'd like to
see Larry McAfee, if possible.

475
00:31:51,835 --> 00:31:56,272
- Are you assigned to
his treatment, Doctor?

476
00:31:56,272 --> 00:31:57,105
- No.

477
00:31:57,105 --> 00:31:58,005
- You're a friend?

478
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,023
- More of an opportunity.

479
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,733
- [Hank] There's some Dr. Fine to see you.

480
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:09,600
- You can tell some Dr. Fine
to stop wasting his time.

481
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,103
- Huh, you don't like doctors, huh?

482
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,230
- If I ever met one who was worth a damn,

483
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,039
I might change my mind.

484
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:19,230
- Well, then you'll be pleased

485
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,230
to know I just told them I was a doctor.

486
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:23,833
- A Dr. Liar?

487
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,123
That's a step up.

488
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,820
- Well, I received an honorary doctorate

489
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,590
from my alma mater a few years ago.

490
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,000
The doctor kind of comes in handy

491
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,803
when I'm trying to find
elusive sources like yourself.

492
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,850
- What am I a source of?

493
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:43,460
- News, I'm Russ Fine, I'd like
you to be on my radio show.

494
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,733
- Yeah, "Fine Line," I know that show.

495
00:32:46,659 --> 00:32:49,500
Now, you talk trash there. (laughs)

496
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,030
Yeah, but it's not to my taste.

497
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,970
I prefer a little Miles Davis.

498
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:58,908
- Sorry, so have you heard
of our show, Mr. McAfee?

499
00:32:58,908 --> 00:33:01,510
- It seems like I've
already been on your show.

500
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,410
- You listened the other night?

501
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:07,410
- I didn't have a choice,
and I didn't like it.

502
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,730
- Well, not having any control over

503
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,800
what people say about you,
that's the price you pay

504
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,100
for being a public figure.

505
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:20,350
- I have no control over people
putting their hands on me

506
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:24,223
or in me, that's being a public figure.

507
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,310
- Well, you gotta be fair, Larry,

508
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,100
I defended you the other night.

509
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,790
Hell, I think most of my listeners
would pull your plug just

510
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,683
to save a few bucks on April 15th.

511
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,313
- My fellow Georgians.

512
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,300
- Well, you've got a story
everybody wants to listen to,

513
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,150
and I'd you to be a guest on my show.

514
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:45,853
- Mr. Fine,

515
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,910
you don't see how hard it
is for my man to travel.

516
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,660
His wheelchair is so high,

517
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,037
and the roof of the ambulance is--

518
00:33:55,037 --> 00:33:58,070
- He can do it right
from here on the phone.

519
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,780
- Phone's a problem
too, see, somebody's got

520
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,943
to hold it for him, dial, hang up.

521
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,684
There'd be only two of us here at night.

522
00:34:07,684 --> 00:34:08,634
- That's a problem?

523
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:14,893
You're gonna have one.

524
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:19,320
Yeah, all right, there it is.

525
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,190
Yeah, hey, Larry, what would you say

526
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,690
if you could use a hands-free
phone from your bed?

527
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,400
- I'd say I'd consider it.

528
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,700
- I'll be back in an hour.

529
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,810
All right.

530
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:48,763
There you go.

531
00:34:50,677 --> 00:34:51,510
Okay.

532
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:53,363
Now,

533
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,450
just blow into the tube a couple of times,

534
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:59,380
and then ask the operator to dial for you.

535
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,550
- You're kidding.

536
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,170
- No, I'm surprised you never
had one of these things.

537
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:05,090
They're pretty standard
these days, you know.

538
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,113
- Hey, Fine.

539
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,520
Sorry I called you a doctor.

540
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,930
- Yeah, I gotta run,
Larry, I'll talk to you.

541
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,138
- I'll call you.

542
00:35:14,138 --> 00:35:16,670
(Russ laughs)

543
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,800
- [Caller] My nephew had
a really bad accident,

544
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,220
and well, we were trying
to keep his spirits up,

545
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,600
and then along comes McAfee.

546
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:26,270
- So what about that, Larry,
are you setting a bad example?

547
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:28,840
- I get real sick of that question.

548
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:32,070
I pleaded my case for
myself, I don't tell anyone

549
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:35,060
to do the same thing, and
I don't remember any rule

550
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,710
which says when your body goes dead,

551
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:41,290
you gotta become some
kind of damn cheerleader.

552
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,080
- [Caller] Why don't
you just do it, McAfee,

553
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,630
and save us all your damn whining?

554
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,783
It ain't nothing but a big bluff.

555
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,223
- [Larry] It's all a bluff, huh?

556
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,220
Well, let me tell you something,

557
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,359
you pig-eyed sack of (beep).

558
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,720
There's not an inch of bluff in my life,

559
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,770
and if you had something
besides (beep) for brains,

560
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:59,770
you'd realize how (beep) serious I am.

561
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:02,600
- Larry, hold it, you're blowing
my callers out of the sky.

562
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,940
- [Larry] Well, maybe your (beep) callers

563
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,393
should (beep) stay a little
(beep) closer to earth.

564
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:10,838
- I've wanted to say that for years.

565
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,890
- [James] We tried, we
just couldn't get it.

566
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,480
- [Larry] So you couldn't tune it in, huh?

567
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,313
- [James] No, sir.

568
00:36:16,313 --> 00:36:17,870
- Well, maybe I can get you
a recording of the show.

569
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,950
- [James] Well, we'd like to hear it, so.

570
00:36:21,352 --> 00:36:24,400
- Listen, Dad, there's
somebody here right now.

571
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,610
I'll call you later, okay?

572
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,498
- [James] You bet, talk to you, now.

573
00:36:28,498 --> 00:36:29,331
- Bye.

574
00:36:29,331 --> 00:36:30,498
- [James] Bye.

575
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,627
- Hi, I'm Dee Fine, I
produce "The Fine Line,"

576
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:36,883
and in my spare time, I'm Russ's wife.

577
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,083
- A woman of the '90s.

578
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,150
- I brought a copy of last night's show,

579
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,250
you were really great.

580
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,310
- Thank you very much.

581
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:49,720
- I'll put it in for you if you show me

582
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,880
where the cassette player is.

583
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,153
- [Larry] I don't have one.

584
00:36:57,391 --> 00:37:00,323
- Okay, well, this
shouldn't take very long.

585
00:37:01,657 --> 00:37:03,145
- What are you doing?

586
00:37:03,145 --> 00:37:03,978
- Well, I.

587
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,333
Well, the show's over,
and this equipment is.

588
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,203
What am I doing?

589
00:37:18,364 --> 00:37:20,490
Have you got a phone I could use?

590
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:21,770
It'll just take a minute.

591
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:22,603
- Outside.

592
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,918
Racist.
(Dee laughs)

593
00:37:31,918 --> 00:37:32,918
Hey, thanks.

594
00:37:34,721 --> 00:37:36,284
You bet.

595
00:37:36,284 --> 00:37:39,580
Here. (background noise
drowns out speaker)

596
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,190
Hey.

597
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,170
Dr. Fine.

598
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,170
- [Russ] Hey, Larry.

599
00:37:44,822 --> 00:37:48,390
- Hell, I never realized
how much I missed talking

600
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,653
to my family privately.

601
00:37:51,941 --> 00:37:53,341
- Well, glad you enjoyed it.

602
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,930
- I'd like to buy this phone from you.

603
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:01,586
Now, Dee told me about what it costs.

604
00:38:01,586 --> 00:38:04,086
- We could write it off, Russ.

605
00:38:05,748 --> 00:38:07,160
- Well, hell, I mean,
just keep it as a gift

606
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:07,993
from the show, Larry.

607
00:38:07,993 --> 00:38:09,610
- Russ, I couldn't do that.

608
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,973
- Well, I bet you could if you tried.

609
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:15,231
Did you listen to it?

610
00:38:15,231 --> 00:38:16,900
- I have no way.

611
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,820
- He doesn't have a cassette player.

612
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:22,120
Larry said they have these units now

613
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,070
with infrared remote control.

614
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,160
- Well, now, you have a charm inside

615
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,110
of that mouth of yours, too, don't you?

616
00:38:29,049 --> 00:38:29,999
- What do you mean?

617
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:36,373
- I mean, my wife doesn't
usually succumb to sweet talk.

618
00:38:37,735 --> 00:38:39,885
- Well, maybe I don't
hear it often enough.

619
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,140
Hey, Larry, do you ever
get out of this place?

620
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,480
- I go to the university for tests.

621
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,680
- Well, that can't be much fun.

622
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,513
- No.

623
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,730
No, ma'am, it's not.

624
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,793
- Excuse me, what's going on here?

625
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:04,020
- I'm going to the
university for my tests,

626
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,760
then I'm gonna hang out.

627
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,540
- That's very nice, Mr. McAfee,

628
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:10,150
but who's gonna take responsibility?

629
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,120
- I am.

630
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,217
- No, I mean, who's gonna be
responsible in case of a--

631
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,050
- I am.

632
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,853
I am sane, I'm an adult, and
I'm responsible for myself.

633
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,660
And I'm going to the university.

634
00:39:27,153 --> 00:39:29,160
- I don't care what Larry says,

635
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,853
I am holding you responsible
for him, Dr. Fine.

636
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,210
- Mrs. Linson, we are simply--

637
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:39,520
- There is nothing simple
when it comes to Larry McAfee,

638
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,870
and that is the first
thing you'd better learn.

639
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:46,124
(slow synth music)

640
00:39:46,124 --> 00:39:49,541
(overlapping chattering)

641
00:39:52,343 --> 00:39:57,343
(slow piano music)
(overlapping chattering)

642
00:40:36,444 --> 00:40:38,861
(Dee laughs)

643
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:58,103
- Hey, Larry, you don't mind
if Dee takes some pictures

644
00:40:58,103 --> 00:40:59,270
of us, do you?

645
00:41:02,728 --> 00:41:03,561
- No.

646
00:41:07,261 --> 00:41:10,011
- Okay, that's good, that's good.

647
00:41:11,554 --> 00:41:12,387
- Huh?

648
00:41:15,037 --> 00:41:17,287
Come on, Larry, let me see.

649
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,693
(ambulance siren wails)

650
00:41:42,202 --> 00:41:44,610
(Larry chokes)
(ventilator rings)

651
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:46,733
It came up so fast.

652
00:41:46,733 --> 00:41:48,670
It sounds like his lungs
are filled with fluid.

653
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,542
- Well, he gets these every now and then,

654
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:54,125
but luckily this one
isn't too bad, please.

655
00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:04,700
- [Russ] So how you doing?

656
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,533
- Okay.

657
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:08,690
- You really had us worried.

658
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,813
I thought it was something I did.

659
00:42:10,813 --> 00:42:12,803
- You're not responsible for me.

660
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:16,673
- Linson says I am.

661
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:20,548
- Where's Dee?

662
00:42:20,548 --> 00:42:23,433
- She had to go back,
prepare tomorrow's show.

663
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,333
- What's it on?

664
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,220
- [Russ] Sports scholarships.

665
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,430
- You do cover a lot of ground.

666
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,030
- That's why I'm only skin deep.

667
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:38,020
- Right.

668
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:48,860
- So did you have a good time today?

669
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:49,693
- Sure did.

670
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,223
Days like this, I,

671
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,003
I can almost forget.

672
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,290
Did you get everything you needed?

673
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,430
- What do you mean?

674
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:11,133
- Publicity pictures of
the quad of the year?

675
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:14,700
- As I recall, I asked your permission.

676
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,800
- What if I said no?

677
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,733
- Then we wouldn't have
taken the pictures.

678
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:21,290
You see, Larry, I'm trying
to protect your rights,

679
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:23,840
even though you're bound and
determined to give them away.

680
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,870
- I'm not giving away nothing.

681
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:26,340
- Oh no?

682
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,583
Then I'll take as many pictures
of your corpse as I want to.

683
00:43:35,094 --> 00:43:37,761
(Larry gurgles)

684
00:43:44,409 --> 00:43:45,242
Larry?

685
00:43:46,128 --> 00:43:46,961
Oh, God.

686
00:43:48,222 --> 00:43:51,066
Mrs. Linson?

687
00:43:51,066 --> 00:43:51,899
Hey!

688
00:44:01,879 --> 00:44:04,462
(Larry laughs)

689
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:10,410
What are you doing?

690
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,523
- Looks like those pictures of
my corpse will have to wait.

691
00:44:15,543 --> 00:44:16,590
- What's your problem, McAfee?

692
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:17,487
I am trying to help you.

693
00:44:17,487 --> 00:44:18,877
- That's my problem.

694
00:44:18,877 --> 00:44:20,500
- What?

695
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,870
- I was hoping you were just out

696
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:23,933
to make a couple of bucks off my ass.

697
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:27,223
But no, you want to help.

698
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:33,130
You want to talk me out of
killing myself, don't you?

699
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,920
- I'm as hard headed as
anybody, except maybe you,

700
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,363
and I'm not trying to
talk you out of anything.

701
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:47,650
I would like to talk you
into saying thank you,

702
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:49,367
just once in a while.

703
00:45:07,903 --> 00:45:10,820
(slow piano music)

704
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,800
- So what do you think of my husband?

705
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,030
- I think he's a lucky man.

706
00:45:23,716 --> 00:45:26,903
- And?

707
00:45:26,903 --> 00:45:29,183
- I don't think he knows how lucky he is.

708
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:32,362
- And?

709
00:45:40,117 --> 00:45:42,370
It's all right, I like a man who knows how

710
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:43,890
to keep his mouth shut.

711
00:45:47,687 --> 00:45:48,520
Okay.

712
00:45:51,562 --> 00:45:52,479
Other side.

713
00:45:58,170 --> 00:45:59,707
- You're sweet to do this, Mrs. Fine.

714
00:45:59,707 --> 00:46:02,320
- If you don't stop calling me Mrs. Fine,

715
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,773
I'm not gonna do your mustache.

716
00:46:07,218 --> 00:46:09,885
(both laughing)

717
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:16,483
Larry?

718
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,400
Are you peeking down my dress?

719
00:46:20,751 --> 00:46:23,418
(both laughing)

720
00:46:27,823 --> 00:46:29,320
- Hell, I ain't sure I trust him.

721
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,340
- Well, he did get Larry a phone

722
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:33,376
so we could talk to him regular.

723
00:46:33,376 --> 00:46:34,890
- Why?

724
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:38,480
- He came the night of
Larry's last seizure.

725
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,743
- Well, I don't like that,
either, we wasn't even called.

726
00:46:44,533 --> 00:46:46,363
(slow piano music)

727
00:46:46,363 --> 00:46:47,613
- There you go.

728
00:46:48,985 --> 00:46:49,818
You want more?

729
00:46:49,818 --> 00:46:51,356
- No, no.

730
00:46:51,356 --> 00:46:53,360
- [James] Well, your mom's
still making these big,

731
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,070
old, fresh peach pies every Easter.

732
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:58,880
It's gotta be fresh peaches,
we out looking for that stuff.

733
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,950
We were out half the night last night.

734
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:08,827
- Oh, Ms. Linson didn't
tell me you had company.

735
00:47:08,827 --> 00:47:11,743
- Oh, no, why don't you join us?

736
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,210
I'm Larry's mother, Amelia McAfee.

737
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:16,930
- [Russ] Russ Fine.

738
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:18,973
- Oh, this is my husband, James.

739
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:21,223
- [Russ] How do you do?

740
00:47:21,223 --> 00:47:23,377
- Hi there.

741
00:47:23,377 --> 00:47:24,900
- Listen, I really have to get back,

742
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:29,900
but Dee wanted you to have
this, Larry, thank you.

743
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:32,963
Boy, you can never get too much pie, huh?

744
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,910
- You can stay, it's okay.

745
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:40,660
- I know, I really have to
go, but I'll be back tomorrow.

746
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:41,493
- Will you?

747
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:44,833
- Yeah.

748
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,450
Pleasure meeting you.

749
00:47:56,969 --> 00:47:59,300
- I think I'm getting kind of tired,

750
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,150
could I transfer to bed?

751
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:02,433
- Yeah, sure thing.

752
00:48:03,743 --> 00:48:07,510
- Jimmy, why don't you
go get yourself some air?

753
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:09,003
I'll help tuck Larry in.

754
00:48:15,908 --> 00:48:20,908
Here we go.
(slow piano music)

755
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:06,460
Your Great Aunt Leonore,

756
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:08,720
the one who sent you the gooseberry jelly,

757
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:13,162
she is going to be 90 years
old come this November.

758
00:49:13,162 --> 00:49:14,195
- How about that?

759
00:49:14,195 --> 00:49:16,960
- We're planning a big
reunion party in Augusta,

760
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,130
and the local hospital there says

761
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:22,033
they just might let you spend the night.

762
00:49:24,303 --> 00:49:27,880
- I won't be there, Mom,
I thought you understood.

763
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,123
- Well, Larry, I just, I thought that

764
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,060
with all your new friends here and all.

765
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:45,143
- Nothing's changed.

766
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,220
- We can still fight this thing, Larry.

767
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,053
- No, Mom.

768
00:49:53,203 --> 00:49:54,940
It's your turn to stop fighting

769
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:57,743
and take some rest.

770
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:03,280
Like you should have been
able to a long time ago, it's

771
00:50:05,818 --> 00:50:08,018
like I stayed a little
baby all these years.

772
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,030
I should have grown up.

773
00:50:18,444 --> 00:50:21,277
- You can never grow up that much.

774
00:50:35,777 --> 00:50:38,480
- So Larry, you knew I was a boxer, right?

775
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,873
Yeah, I get whipped pretty
good in my last bout.

776
00:50:46,248 --> 00:50:48,548
And I could have beat
him, (laughs) El Cubano.

777
00:50:54,871 --> 00:50:55,913
Tough little dude.

778
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:11,550
So, the count's at zip,
and I could barely see,

779
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:13,640
blood's coming out of my eyes,

780
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,540
and I'm about ready to go down myself.

781
00:51:18,604 --> 00:51:22,815
So I look over there, and
there he is, getting up.

782
00:51:22,815 --> 00:51:24,726
I told the referee, I said,

783
00:51:24,726 --> 00:51:28,809
"Don't you let the sucker
get up from there," oh!

784
00:51:31,615 --> 00:51:34,532
(ventilator beeps)

785
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,760
- Let me up.

786
00:51:38,663 --> 00:51:40,663
- Help, he's on the floor!

787
00:51:40,663 --> 00:51:42,270
- [Larry] Well, lift me
up, you dumb bastard.

788
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:47,010
- [Hank] I need help on the floor.

789
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,420
- [Russ] There was some kind of incident,

790
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,110
and now he's throwing a fit.

791
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:51,200
- Is he okay?

792
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,033
- Apparently.

793
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,540
- Then what do they need you
for, you're not his doctor.

794
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:59,330
- Mrs. Linson says I'm the only one

795
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:01,940
that can calm him down,
she says he listens to me.

796
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:02,773
- He does.

797
00:52:02,773 --> 00:52:04,203
- But why does everybody seem to think

798
00:52:04,203 --> 00:52:06,750
that Larry and I have this special bond?

799
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:08,410
Hell, all we does is argue.

800
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:11,413
- Between two argumentative
people, that is a bond.

801
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:23,840
- I'm sorry, but his parents
live in the next state,

802
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,193
and I didn't know who else to call.

803
00:52:25,193 --> 00:52:26,793
- It's okay.

804
00:52:26,793 --> 00:52:28,403
- Mr. Fine, you're his friend.

805
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:30,700
- So they keep telling me.

806
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,530
- Look, we're not against
Larry here, it's just that all

807
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:36,440
of these negative episodes
just keep piling up.

808
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:39,290
He could just use some
straightening out on a few things.

809
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:42,290
- Like what things?

810
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:44,530
- Well, he could be a
lot nicer to the staff,

811
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:46,100
he could conform to the schedule.

812
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,500
But sometimes it seems like
all he can do is complain.

813
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,540
- That is all he can do.

814
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,723
- I see, you're his friend, not ours.

815
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:56,363
- Mrs. Linson, he's the
one that needs a friend.

816
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:01,907
- Best of them got the
brains of squirrels.

817
00:53:01,907 --> 00:53:04,210
"Just follow the schedule, Larry,"

818
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:06,108
and, "shut your mouth, Larry," and

819
00:53:06,108 --> 00:53:08,427
"what does it matter to
you, Larry, you thing,

820
00:53:08,427 --> 00:53:12,623
"you side of meat, you living mouth.

821
00:53:14,467 --> 00:53:16,917
"What's he complaining
about, we didn't drop him.

822
00:53:18,367 --> 00:53:19,497
"Hell, he'd know if we dropped him,

823
00:53:19,497 --> 00:53:20,797
"Hank caught him in time."

824
00:53:21,947 --> 00:53:23,703
- Well, he did catch you.

825
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:27,143
- Break out the champagne.

826
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,313
I've had it.

827
00:53:37,167 --> 00:53:40,552
I can't live in fear
and anger all the time.

828
00:53:40,552 --> 00:53:41,863
- Then don't.

829
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,190
Move beyond them.

830
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:45,023
- I'm going to.

831
00:53:47,271 --> 00:53:48,393
The time has come.

832
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:51,163
- [Russ] It's not what I meant.

833
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:53,573
- I know.

834
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,770
Now, you don't like it when
I talk about dying, do you?

835
00:53:57,770 --> 00:53:58,603
- No.

836
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:00,960
- Why is that?

837
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:20,540
- I had this

838
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:26,363
friend in high school,
he was a good friend.

839
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:29,853
He had bone cancer,

840
00:54:32,587 --> 00:54:35,503
he was in terrible pain
and he was dying, and

841
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:40,173
my father and I went up to see him.

842
00:54:47,557 --> 00:54:48,403
"Please,

843
00:54:50,517 --> 00:54:52,003
"Dr. Fine, do something.

844
00:54:53,057 --> 00:54:56,623
"Please, take me out of the pain.

845
00:54:58,417 --> 00:54:59,250
"Please."

846
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,673
- Did you?

847
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:08,003
- Dr. Fine was my father.

848
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:13,260
Fortunately Mike died shortly after that.

849
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:18,833
But I always wondered, what would I do?

850
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:22,273
What was the right thing,
what was the ethical thing?

851
00:55:22,273 --> 00:55:25,483
What would I do when I became a doctor?

852
00:55:27,811 --> 00:55:29,211
- You never became a doctor.

853
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:31,693
- Right.

854
00:55:33,216 --> 00:55:35,316
I quit med school after a couple of years.

855
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:38,430
Show business, you know.

856
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:45,193
I became a personality
rather than a person,

857
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:48,070
that's what my dad said, anyway.

858
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,170
Larry, I came here to do a talk show, but

859
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,570
I found out that

860
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:07,320
I need to answer that question.

861
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:11,223
- I want to die, now.

862
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:15,190
Think back to your friend.

863
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,693
Please, help me end it.

864
00:56:25,781 --> 00:56:26,614
- How?

865
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:30,253
- Install the switch.

866
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:43,650
- The fact that you're even
considering this makes me crazy.

867
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,810
You could be charged with homicide.

868
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:47,960
You could serve years in prison.

869
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:51,610
- Larry's court decision
could stand as a precedent.

870
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:54,440
- Larry went to court in
Georgia, this is Alabama.

871
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,333
- I know what state I'm in, Dee.

872
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:01,090
- I hope you--
- What?

873
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:05,163
What?

874
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,660
- I hope you're not thinking
that this'll be a story for us,

875
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:14,460
that somehow we could get the
rights to Larry's suicide.

876
00:57:19,883 --> 00:57:22,800
(slow piano music)

877
00:57:27,196 --> 00:57:28,279
- Hey, Larry.

878
00:57:44,666 --> 00:57:46,083
It seems so cold.

879
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:50,743
- Wanting to be here, to help me,

880
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,600
to be a part of it, that
seems like a kindness,

881
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,433
but it's not.

882
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:02,923
I have to have control, Russ.

883
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:09,873
I need control over this one thing.

884
00:58:21,828 --> 00:58:22,661
- Well, I,

885
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:29,220
if I believe that people like
you should have all the rights

886
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:30,350
of others, then

887
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:35,840
this right has to be one of them.

888
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:46,760
I'll do that favor.

889
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:51,902
If you ask.

890
00:58:56,392 --> 00:58:57,309
- I do ask.

891
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:01,476
(slow synth music)

892
00:59:21,247 --> 00:59:22,313
- Are you Russ?

893
00:59:24,132 --> 00:59:24,965
- Yes.

894
00:59:36,164 --> 00:59:37,414
- I don't know,

895
00:59:39,415 --> 00:59:40,665
do I thank you?

896
01:01:15,945 --> 01:01:18,528
(switch beeps)

897
01:01:27,939 --> 01:01:30,863
- Larry, I've done as you asked.

898
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,003
Three short puffs, that stops your air.

899
01:01:42,128 --> 01:01:43,128
- Thank you.

900
01:01:45,603 --> 01:01:46,893
- See you tomorrow?

901
01:01:51,347 --> 01:01:52,180
- You bet.

902
01:02:27,453 --> 01:02:30,787
- Hey, Larry, y'all
sleeping in this morning?

903
01:02:33,686 --> 01:02:35,519
Hey, Larry, you awake?

904
01:02:39,498 --> 01:02:41,998
(phone rings)

905
01:02:47,767 --> 01:02:48,600
- Hello?

906
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:52,163
Hi, Larry.

907
01:02:54,143 --> 01:02:56,643
No, no, no, we're awake, yeah.

908
01:03:01,926 --> 01:03:03,009
- Hey, Larry.

909
01:03:06,987 --> 01:03:08,154
How you doing?

910
01:03:19,617 --> 01:03:21,784
Yeah, I'll be right there.

911
01:03:32,853 --> 01:03:34,893
- What happened last night?

912
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:38,483
- Nothing.

913
01:03:39,552 --> 01:03:40,385
- Nothing?

914
01:03:43,018 --> 01:03:45,768
Or nothing you can tell me about?

915
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,871
(slow piano music)

916
01:04:05,871 --> 01:04:06,704
- Dee.

917
01:04:15,277 --> 01:04:17,027
Something did happen.

918
01:04:25,185 --> 01:04:26,870
- I really looked it
in the face last night,

919
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:28,213
I was right there.

920
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,963
No judges, no lawyers, no press,

921
01:04:35,849 --> 01:04:37,053
just me and that switch.

922
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:44,027
I want to thank you.

923
01:04:46,147 --> 01:04:47,540
And you gave me something

924
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:50,900
I can control

925
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:52,703
myself.

926
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:59,860
And I'd forgotten what that was like.

927
01:05:03,288 --> 01:05:04,920
- How does it make you feel?

928
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:05,753
- I want more.

929
01:05:08,544 --> 01:05:10,550
More control over my life.

930
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:15,643
- Well, that you're gonna
have to get for yourself.

931
01:05:17,438 --> 01:05:18,540
- [Operator] Operator.

932
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:22,048
- Yes, operator, I'm a disabled user.

933
01:05:22,048 --> 01:05:22,920
- [Operator] Yes?

934
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,747
- Would you look for a
number and connect me?

935
01:05:24,747 --> 01:05:26,753
- [Operator] And the
party's name and city?

936
01:05:28,139 --> 01:05:29,150
- The Fullan House Center

937
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:32,193
for Independent Living, Birmingham.

938
01:05:36,512 --> 01:05:38,993
- [Meredith] I think it's
another sub directory.

939
01:05:38,993 --> 01:05:40,625
(overlapping chattering)

940
01:05:40,625 --> 01:05:42,380
- The star has arrived.

941
01:05:43,625 --> 01:05:44,610
- I'm not a star.

942
01:05:44,610 --> 01:05:46,803
- Modesty becomes a star most.

943
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:50,650
I'm surprised, though,

944
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:53,450
this is the last place I'd
expect Larry McAfee to visit.

945
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:55,830
- Why?

946
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:58,730
- Well, ain't nobody here gonna
throw that switch for you.

947
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:07,023
Come on, I'll show you around.
(slow piano music)

948
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:21,143
Most everybody works,
and we pool our funds.

949
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:25,003
We hire full-time attendants.

950
01:06:27,290 --> 01:06:29,310
Of course, we fire them,
too, if they don't work out,

951
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:32,283
see, it's a business, not a charity.

952
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:35,683
- Begin line.

953
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:38,308
Move up.

954
01:06:38,308 --> 01:06:39,725
Move up, move up,

955
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:42,400
move up.

956
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,393
Move up, move up.

957
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:47,531
End line.

958
01:06:47,531 --> 01:06:49,813
- [Meredith] You're
learning this pretty fast.

959
01:06:49,813 --> 01:06:51,863
Now, take a look from the top, say, "3D."

960
01:06:52,844 --> 01:06:53,677
- 3D.

961
01:06:56,910 --> 01:06:58,597
That's amazing.

962
01:06:58,597 --> 01:07:00,297
- What software are you using now?

963
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:04,436
- None.

964
01:07:04,436 --> 01:07:07,220
(overlapping chattering)

965
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:09,130
- You want to give some of
these things here a try,

966
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:12,283
well, then I'm your friend,
all these people are.

967
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:18,093
- And if I don't?

968
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,497
- You keep going ahead with
this death switch thing,

969
01:07:20,497 --> 01:07:23,207
and we're gonna fight you, we have to.

970
01:07:25,844 --> 01:07:27,430
You see, it's just too damn convenient

971
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:30,180
for the rest of the world to
have us killing ourselves.

972
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:34,387
(ventilator beeps)

973
01:07:39,115 --> 01:07:41,782
(Larry gurgles)

974
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,360
- This was a bad one,
but his lungs are clear

975
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:03,380
and the EEG is settling down.

976
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:04,213
- Is he okay?

977
01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:07,833
What brings these things on?

978
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:11,060
- I think this is emotional distress.

979
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:12,670
It's like in the last few days,

980
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:14,170
Larry's had a lot on his mind.

981
01:08:15,810 --> 01:08:17,933
Are you planning on
staying until he wakes up?

982
01:08:17,933 --> 01:08:19,230
- Yes, I am.

983
01:08:19,230 --> 01:08:22,100
- Good, because after
an episode like this,

984
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:24,080
a lot of severely disabled patients,

985
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,180
when they wake up, they're very depressed.

986
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:31,263
I know you're familiar with
Larry's legal action in Georgia.

987
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,993
I guess what I'm saying
is, you're his friend.

988
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,023
So in the next few days,

989
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:41,740
I would do my best to

990
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:44,193
watch him.

991
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:47,183
- I understand.

992
01:08:53,497 --> 01:08:57,330
Been a real battle of
wills, hasn't it, Larry?

993
01:09:01,230 --> 01:09:05,100
You won most of the
rounds, but I got you now.

994
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:39,290
Hell, I put this damn thing
in, maybe I should take it out.

995
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:43,820
I mean, at least until you,

996
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,550
what, get that old bounce
back in your stride?

997
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:13,990
I'm not gonna play God, Larry,

998
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:15,653
I'm not gonna go back on my word.

999
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:32,903
You're in control.

1000
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:39,816
(Larry cries)

1001
01:10:43,879 --> 01:10:46,796
(slow piano music)

1002
01:10:57,567 --> 01:10:59,400
- Larry, are you okay?

1003
01:11:06,819 --> 01:11:11,819
Are you crying because we
interfered and saved your life, or

1004
01:11:12,972 --> 01:11:16,087
because you came close and
then were afraid to die?

1005
01:11:20,618 --> 01:11:21,451
- Afraid.

1006
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:51,000
- [Bill] Welcome to Fullan House, Larry.

1007
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,490
- Thank you, so where is everybody?

1008
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:57,810
- Where is everybody, everybody's at work.

1009
01:11:57,810 --> 01:11:59,903
We got no stars here, Mr. McAfee.

1010
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:03,610
Pull attitude, find yourself eating alone.

1011
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:05,130
- I can't eat alone.

1012
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:05,963
- I know.

1013
01:12:10,456 --> 01:12:11,692
- Well, talk about some attitude.

1014
01:12:11,692 --> 01:12:14,020
(Bill laughs)

1015
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:16,030
- No, I'm glad I could
get you in here, Larry,

1016
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:17,783
but it's only temporary.

1017
01:12:19,786 --> 01:12:21,460
I don't even have a real room for you,

1018
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:23,590
you're gonna have to bunk in the library.

1019
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:25,220
- I appreciate it.

1020
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:27,370
- I'll be out in the
garden if you need me.

1021
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:34,833
- Linson said I had to
read you this release form.

1022
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:41,143
But hell, you're on your
own, Jack, good luck.

1023
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:43,063
- Listen, Hank,

1024
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:47,430
I don't know how to thank you,

1025
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:49,780
especially after the things I called you.

1026
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:50,713
- Long forgotten.

1027
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:53,840
- I wish I'd seen that fight.

1028
01:12:55,210 --> 01:12:57,060
- [Hank] Which fight?

1029
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:58,274
- El Cubano.

1030
01:12:58,274 --> 01:13:00,774
(Hank laughs)

1031
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:04,910
- See you around, Hank.

1032
01:13:11,712 --> 01:13:13,370
You gonna be okay?

1033
01:13:13,370 --> 01:13:14,920
- Yeah, I think I'll be all right,

1034
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:19,186
if I can stay clear of her, huh?

1035
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:22,030
- Well, if you need anything,
you just give me a call.

1036
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:22,863
- You bet.

1037
01:13:25,655 --> 01:13:26,738
Thanks, Russ.

1038
01:13:47,972 --> 01:13:50,889
(slow piano music)

1039
01:14:45,413 --> 01:14:49,590
Move up, move up, move up.

1040
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:50,423
Move right.

1041
01:14:51,483 --> 01:14:52,533
Move down.

1042
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:55,093
Curve.

1043
01:14:57,310 --> 01:14:58,143
Connect.

1044
01:15:05,390 --> 01:15:06,223
KC.

1045
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:09,293
Radio.

1046
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,073
Turn off.

1047
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:15,953
Lights.

1048
01:15:17,610 --> 01:15:18,443
Turn off.

1049
01:15:20,352 --> 01:15:23,196
- [Dee] You miss him, don't you?

1050
01:15:23,196 --> 01:15:25,113
- [Russ] Not that much.

1051
01:15:35,041 --> 01:15:36,291
- Why don't you call him?

1052
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:42,643
- I'm yesterday's friend, that's good.

1053
01:15:55,910 --> 01:15:57,267
What was that for?

1054
01:15:57,267 --> 01:15:58,217
- For what you did.

1055
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:03,680
- You don't know what I did.

1056
01:16:07,793 --> 01:16:08,793
- All right.

1057
01:16:10,278 --> 01:16:12,695
Then it's just for being you.

1058
01:16:21,481 --> 01:16:23,060
- At night, we cook our own meals,

1059
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:26,583
and most of the rent is
paid by the people who work.

1060
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:30,333
- It's an amazing place, amazing.

1061
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:32,483
- Hey, Larry.

1062
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:34,913
- How you doing?

1063
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:39,663
- Looks like you made
yourself some new friends.

1064
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:46,363
- Looks like that gal's got
it kind of sweet for you.

1065
01:16:46,363 --> 01:16:48,530
- She's nice to everybody.

1066
01:16:53,019 --> 01:16:53,852
She is.

1067
01:16:54,857 --> 01:16:57,920
(slow orchestral music)

1068
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,264
(Meredith knocks)

1069
01:17:00,264 --> 01:17:01,858
Meredith.

1070
01:17:01,858 --> 01:17:03,003
How's it going?

1071
01:17:03,003 --> 01:17:04,113
- I saw your light on.

1072
01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:06,443
- KC.

1073
01:17:07,810 --> 01:17:08,643
Radio.

1074
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:10,673
Turn off.

1075
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:13,830
- Your mom and dad go back to the hotel?

1076
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:15,033
- Yeah, come on in.

1077
01:17:17,108 --> 01:17:18,890
- They seem like good people.

1078
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:19,723
- The best.

1079
01:17:22,921 --> 01:17:24,923
- You've got a lot of
people that care about you.

1080
01:17:26,170 --> 01:17:27,020
It's good, Larry.

1081
01:17:36,609 --> 01:17:39,810
- Did you come here to tell me that?

1082
01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:40,643
- No.

1083
01:17:41,910 --> 01:17:43,060
Just looking in on you.

1084
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:46,120
- Well, I'm okay, I'm

1085
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,393
not planning on doing myself in.

1086
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,010
- Great.

1087
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:54,160
- Hey, hey, wait, wait.

1088
01:17:56,906 --> 01:17:58,403
What is it, what's up?

1089
01:18:00,670 --> 01:18:03,370
- You're not the only one
who thinks about it, McAfee.

1090
01:18:09,536 --> 01:18:11,703
- You always seem so damn happy.

1091
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:15,620
- Maybe I find it boring to
bitch about what I don't have.

1092
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:22,050
It's funny.
(slow piano music)

1093
01:18:22,050 --> 01:18:24,970
Your legs don't work,
your arms don't work.

1094
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:27,020
You need that ventilator just to breathe,

1095
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:29,650
and I'm envious of you.

1096
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:31,353
- Why?

1097
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:34,990
- You have parents that love you.

1098
01:18:36,212 --> 01:18:37,450
- [Larry] Where are your parents?

1099
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:38,473
- St. Louis.

1100
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:41,263
- It's not so far.

1101
01:18:43,345 --> 01:18:44,495
- It could be the moon.

1102
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:47,830
Oh, sure, they feel real sorry for me,

1103
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:52,830
but they find being around
cripples terribly depressing.

1104
01:19:21,210 --> 01:19:22,436
- You feel that?

1105
01:19:22,436 --> 01:19:26,710
- [Meredith] What?

1106
01:19:26,710 --> 01:19:27,837
- My arm around you.

1107
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,150
It's pulling you close.

1108
01:19:44,430 --> 01:19:45,273
- Thanks, Larry.

1109
01:19:47,344 --> 01:19:48,261
- What for?

1110
01:19:54,885 --> 01:19:57,218
- [Meredith] For being here.

1111
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:04,010
- Where do I stand?

1112
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:08,830
- [Bill] I wish I had access
to state funds, but I don't.

1113
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:13,070
- Well, how much longer
can y'all carry him?

1114
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:15,893
- Four weeks, maybe five.

1115
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:22,353
- This never ends.

1116
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:26,393
- I'm not going back to a nursing home.

1117
01:20:28,968 --> 01:20:31,885
(slow piano music)

1118
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:57,063
- My God, just once, I wish
he could hear some good news.

1119
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:01,942
(Russ knocks)

1120
01:21:01,942 --> 01:21:03,210
- Not now.

1121
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:04,950
- If not now, when?

1122
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:05,783
- Russ?

1123
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:08,373
Hey.

1124
01:21:10,064 --> 01:21:10,897
How are you?

1125
01:21:10,897 --> 01:21:11,730
- Fantastic.

1126
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:15,553
Well, you look like you're
pretty much at home in here.

1127
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:18,063
- Not for long.

1128
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:21,290
- Yeah, hey, how come when you need help,

1129
01:21:21,290 --> 01:21:23,540
I gotta hear about it from your mom?

1130
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:24,990
- There's nothing you can do.

1131
01:21:26,478 --> 01:21:28,028
- It's my time to waste, Larry.

1132
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:33,493
Hey.

1133
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:35,753
Does this thing

1134
01:21:37,470 --> 01:21:38,563
work with hands?

1135
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:47,820
Okay, so this is a story
of a man with a big mouth.

1136
01:21:53,190 --> 01:21:57,060
Okay, for real, a man
who once wanted to die,

1137
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:59,803
to kill himself, but who
now chooses to go on living.

1138
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:02,870
The question is, is
there a meaningful life

1139
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:05,890
for such a man in the state

1140
01:22:06,790 --> 01:22:07,623
of Georgia?

1141
01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:10,253
How's that sound?

1142
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:12,443
- Swell.

1143
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:16,550
- Come on, Larry, I need your help.

1144
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:18,570
Now, I'm writing it,
Franklin's gonna send it

1145
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:21,410
to his political contacts, your job is

1146
01:22:21,410 --> 01:22:24,350
to get those McAfee fires burning again.

1147
01:22:24,350 --> 01:22:25,600
- What good will that do?

1148
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:28,903
- What good does depression do?

1149
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,143
- Less far to fall.

1150
01:22:40,601 --> 01:22:43,101
(phone rings)

1151
01:22:48,943 --> 01:22:49,776
- Hello?

1152
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:56,040
No.

1153
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:58,193
No problem, Senator.

1154
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,700
Yes, Senator Shumake, I remember your name

1155
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:05,050
from the mailing list, sir.

1156
01:23:07,490 --> 01:23:09,050
No, I,

1157
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:11,263
you are the only one who has responded.

1158
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:17,730
Wonderful, what we are asking

1159
01:23:17,730 --> 01:23:22,643
for is the state just try the
independent living concept.

1160
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,763
No, not even a pilot program.

1161
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:32,983
Sir, we are running out of time.

1162
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:39,147
"We provide necessary care,
we provide adequate care,

1163
01:23:39,147 --> 01:23:42,447
"but we do not provide, and
for lack of a better word,

1164
01:23:42,447 --> 01:23:47,447
"Cadillac care, that is
true, that is a fact."

1165
01:23:47,630 --> 01:23:49,730
That quote belongs to Aaron Johnson,

1166
01:23:49,730 --> 01:23:52,423
Georgia's State Human
Services Commissioner.

1167
01:23:54,170 --> 01:23:56,360
He has more recently said
that he's not even sure,

1168
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:58,710
Larry, that you're still
a resident of Georgia.

1169
01:23:59,730 --> 01:24:02,665
- I am a Georgia citizen, born and raised.

1170
01:24:02,665 --> 01:24:05,120
And I want to go back to
be close to my family,

1171
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:08,363
but I will not go back to a nursing home.

1172
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:12,270
- Well, Larry, the
reality is, you're broke,

1173
01:24:12,270 --> 01:24:15,400
and that is the only kind of care

1174
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:17,350
that the state will provide.

1175
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:18,473
- I will not go back.

1176
01:24:19,970 --> 01:24:21,540
- [Russ] All right, then,
let's go to the phone lines.

1177
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:24,200
Caller, you are on "The Fine Line."

1178
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,490
- [Caller] Larry, I heard
you're being invited

1179
01:24:26,490 --> 01:24:29,720
to go back to Georgia next week
to speak to the legislature.

1180
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:31,440
- That hasn't been confirmed yet.

1181
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,600
- [Caller] But if you go back to Atlanta,

1182
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,563
you could have the switch put in?

1183
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,233
- Right.

1184
01:24:39,233 --> 01:24:40,860
- [Caller] You could
throw the switch back,

1185
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:43,960
too, isn't that right, right
on the State House steps,

1186
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:46,233
with no harm to anybody that helps.

1187
01:24:47,550 --> 01:24:50,410
- That's right, when I'm in Georgia.

1188
01:24:50,410 --> 01:24:52,510
- [Caller] So what are you planning to do?

1189
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:57,753
- I plan

1190
01:24:59,330 --> 01:25:01,080
never to go back to a nursing home.

1191
01:25:02,449 --> 01:25:05,366
(slow piano music)

1192
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:14,117
(overlapping chattering)

1193
01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:22,320
- Larry McAfee, I'm
Senator Hildred Shumake.

1194
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:25,230
- Senator, I want to
thank you for your help.

1195
01:25:25,230 --> 01:25:27,040
- Well, Larry, I'm just
glad that you could be

1196
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:27,903
with us today.

1197
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:33,240
Besides, Larry, you and I
are pretty much the same age,

1198
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:34,840
from the same part of the state.

1199
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:38,190
Now, if we can't support
each other, who's gonna?

1200
01:25:40,767 --> 01:25:43,613
You did vote for me, didn't you? (laughs)

1201
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:46,963
Now, look, Larry, we're going in there.

1202
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:51,860
I can't do anything about that
seating, you understand that?

1203
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:54,360
And some of the ornery
(mumbles) state birds are

1204
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,840
gonna be sitting there
right in that front row,

1205
01:25:56,840 --> 01:26:00,063
and they're gonna be looking
at you right in the eye.

1206
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:03,290
- I'll look them back.

1207
01:26:04,461 --> 01:26:05,711
- There you go.

1208
01:26:35,807 --> 01:26:36,640
Senators.

1209
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:42,540
At my invitation, please,
give your attention

1210
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:43,853
to Larry McAfee.

1211
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:53,743
- Thank you for the
opportunity to be here today.

1212
01:26:56,350 --> 01:26:59,100
I am deeply grateful for this
chance to speak with you,

1213
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:01,910
and to plead for your help.

1214
01:27:10,650 --> 01:27:11,913
In 1987,

1215
01:27:13,650 --> 01:27:15,673
I broke my neck in a traffic accident,

1216
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:21,173
and in an instant, my life changed.

1217
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:27,423
For five years, I have been
paralyzed from the neck down.

1218
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:34,073
I must rely on a machine
to pump air into my lungs.

1219
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,793
I cannot feed myself,

1220
01:27:40,150 --> 01:27:44,670
nor can I empty my bladder
or my bowels without the help

1221
01:27:44,670 --> 01:27:45,593
of another person.

1222
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:54,223
I never dreamed such a
thing could happen to me.

1223
01:27:56,850 --> 01:27:58,083
No one ever does.

1224
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:02,493
I'm a young man, I want to work.

1225
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,420
Young men should work and pay their taxes.

1226
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,723
But that is not my fate.

1227
01:28:11,670 --> 01:28:15,910
Mine is an existence
without choice or control,

1228
01:28:15,910 --> 01:28:17,963
away from family and friends.

1229
01:28:20,830 --> 01:28:25,110
Imagine being 34 years old and having,

1230
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:28,650
as your only companions, elderly,

1231
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:31,620
ventilator-dependent patients
whose minds have ceased

1232
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:33,730
to function long ago.

1233
01:28:33,730 --> 01:28:35,703
Now, I call it prison.

1234
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:39,950
What else should I call it?

1235
01:28:43,890 --> 01:28:46,980
What I am pleading for here today is

1236
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:49,420
that changes be made in a system

1237
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:51,450
that pays hundreds of dollars a day

1238
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:55,410
for us to be warehoused and forgotten

1239
01:28:55,410 --> 01:28:59,520
in high tech facilities
which we do not require,

1240
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:00,523
need, or want.

1241
01:29:02,770 --> 01:29:06,680
And instead, to have a
fraction of that money

1242
01:29:08,830 --> 01:29:12,900
be redirected to independent
living opportunities.

1243
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:15,200
Now, the models for such
places are out there,

1244
01:29:16,330 --> 01:29:19,033
they exist in many other states.

1245
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:27,363
I see you are looking at me.

1246
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:31,883
I'm used to that.

1247
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:38,710
But as you look and listen
to the constant sucking

1248
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:42,020
of my breathing machine, you remember

1249
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:46,433
that in an instant,
this can happen to you.

1250
01:29:49,070 --> 01:29:49,903
Or worse,

1251
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:52,503
to someone you love.

1252
01:29:55,850 --> 01:29:58,133
Remember James and Amelia McAfee,

1253
01:29:59,810 --> 01:30:04,810
their bravery and their pain,
as they fought a whole state

1254
01:30:05,299 --> 01:30:07,097
for the sake of their son.

1255
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:12,483
We do not ask for charity.

1256
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:17,960
By helping us, you help yourselves,

1257
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:22,780
because in the final analysis, we are

1258
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:25,928
each our brothers' keepers.

1259
01:30:25,928 --> 01:30:28,845
(slow synth music)

1260
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:30,713
Thank you.

1261
01:30:32,047 --> 01:30:34,193
(group applauds)

1262
01:30:34,193 --> 01:30:36,276
- [Audience Member] Yeah.

1263
01:31:26,383 --> 01:31:28,716
- I've done as you've asked.

1264
01:31:29,977 --> 01:31:30,977
- Thank you.

1265
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:33,230
- See you tomorrow?

1266
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:36,173
- You bet.

1267
01:31:38,536 --> 01:31:41,453
(slow piano music)

1268
01:32:23,575 --> 01:32:26,492
(slow synth music)

1269
01:32:41,271 --> 01:32:44,188
(slow piano music)

1270
01:35:28,632 --> 01:35:31,049
(slow music)
