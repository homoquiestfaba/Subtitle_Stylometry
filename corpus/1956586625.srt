1
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:54,369
Four, five, six.

2
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:09,868
Yeah!

3
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,414
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

4
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,119
Yeah!

5
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,333
Yeah, Shawn!

6
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,375
Yeah, yeah!

7
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:54,748
You were great.

8
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,490
I really love being here.

9
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,198
Thanks for bringing me.

10
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:00,417
I wouldn't go anywhere
without you, little brother.

11
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:03,158
You're a big reason why
this dream's come true.

12
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,991
1 was a little bit
worried about the crowd.

13
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,456
I don't think they liked an American

14
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:08,782
winning the championship.

15
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,036
Ah, they just wanted a good fight

16
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,241
and we gave it to them, didn't we?

17
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:14,458
The thais are great.

18
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,582
Come to congratulate me, huh?

19
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:00,953
You were not to win tonight.

20
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:02,167
I couldn't help it.

21
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,413
He wasn't much competition.

22
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,832
An American can never be champion.

23
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:14,406
You shouldn't have won the fight tonight.

24
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,697
And you won't win this one.

25
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,915
I do my best fighting in the ring, man.

26
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,615
Besides that, me and my brother.

27
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,198
No!

28
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:13,417
No, Shawn!

29
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:18,958
No, Shawn!

30
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:21,292
No!

31
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,956
No!

32
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:26,828
Murderer!

33
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,866
Something to remember me by.

34
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,118
Here we go.

35
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,698
All systems check.

36
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:04,032
Let's do this thing.

37
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,768
After all, my favorite
show's coming on soon.

38
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,032
Keep your short pants on.

39
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,161
Romper room doesn't start for 45 minutes.

40
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,498
Let's keep the chatter to a minimum.

41
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:16,322
He's gone in.

42
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:18,157
Give me the word, control.

43
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,740
You'll be the first to know.

44
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:14,116
You show me yours, I'll
show you mine.

45
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:27,534
Looking good.

46
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,618
Looking damn good.

47
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:46,283
Woo, not bad, boys.

48
00:08:50,042 --> 00:08:51,248
My turn, huh?

49
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,789
I think you cheated me.

50
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,410
Maybe I'll just keep 'em both.

51
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:14,624
There's not a penny missing, Jackson.

52
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,791
So do yourself a favor and
put the gun away happily.

53
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:24,702
Maybe I'll see you get more
of my business.

54
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,037
I hate to put a damper
on your little party,

55
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,823
but have you guys thought
about what happens

56
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:35,373
to the kids who use this?

57
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,787
Have you seen what it does to 'em?

58
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,410
Who cares?

59
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:42,157
I care, Jackson.

60
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,991
Hey, my name ain't Jackson.

61
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,164
You a fucking social worker or something?

62
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,490
Nah, Jackson.

63
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,240
I ain't a social worker,

64
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:54,953
but I'm the next best thing.

65
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,333
I'm a cop.

66
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,083
Hey, man.

67
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:07,909
Hey, hey.

68
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,831
That's a good one.

69
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,042
You're okay.

70
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:12,907
Hell, you can hang with us anytime.

71
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,240
Right, guys?

72
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,458
A fucking cop.

73
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:18,329
Nah, just a plain old cop.

74
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:20,703
Fucking's got nothing
to do with it, really.

75
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:22,202
I am.

76
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:27,457
Look, here's my badge
and I'm wearing a wire.

77
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:28,667
Damn it.

78
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:31,658
He's doing it again, sarge.

79
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:35,572
Guys, I'm not gonna be
needing you after all.

80
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:38,954
I can handle these assholes by myself.

81
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:42,952
Jesus Christ.

82
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:44,955
Get in there now.

83
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:46,167
Officer in trouble.

84
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,573
Repeat, officer in trouble.

85
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:48,872
Code 10-99.

86
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:55,660
My man, you just made a big mistake.

87
00:10:56,542 --> 00:10:57,907
You're gonna die now.

88
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,285
Not today, Jackson.

89
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,500
Not today.

90
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:00,657
He tricked us again.

91
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:01,955
Shit.

92
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:03,202
Let's go.

93
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,164
Does that hurt?

94
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,375
Huh?

95
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,500
Good.

96
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,286
What, no search warrant?

97
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,661
I'm gonna have your
butt for this, donahue.

98
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:41,875
Promises, promises.

99
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:45,158
Hey, clean this mess up for me, will you?

100
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,493
Il want to see it!

101
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,456
I'm not asking for much!

102
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:18,782
Just routine!

103
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,117
I'm only the captain for Christ sake!

104
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:25,322
Give me a break, you bunch of assholes!

105
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:27,908
You should be working
in toilets, all of ya!

106
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,500
Hey, come on, you guys.

107
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:32,242
Come and check this out.

108
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,458
Come on, come on.

109
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:34,327
Get out of there!

110
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:36,498
Get back to work, you asshole!

111
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,282
Who the fuck do you think you are?

112
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,161
I sent the backup for your protection.

113
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:44,827
Goddamn it.

114
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:46,202
I gave 'em the address.

115
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:48,499
It's not my fault they
went to the wrong building.

116
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,081
You told them, I quote,

117
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:53,489
empire industrial park, building five.

118
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,500
See?

119
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,908
Very clear, very concise.

120
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,456
But you were in building four.

121
00:13:58,667 --> 00:13:59,907
Now, what kind of crap is that?

122
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:03,624
Look, the bottom line
is I get the job done.

123
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:07,121
No, the bottom line is I can
only cover you for so long.

124
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,449
We've been through the fire before, cap.

125
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,783
Did you have to take the wire off?

126
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,199
Where the hell was your weapon, Jake?

127
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:20,748
You're the best undercover
cop I've ever seen,

128
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,869
but you're just pissing it away.

129
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,916
Look, I had to get the
bust and I got it clean.

130
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,615
No problems in court.

131
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,074
Except for cries of police brutality.

132
00:14:30,292 --> 00:14:32,658
Those bastards are going
away for a long time.

133
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:33,875
End of story.

134
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,911
Cheer up, cap.

135
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,867
We got the bad guys and
that's what we get paid for.

136
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:42,828
It's like the old west out there

137
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,698
and we're wearing the white hats.

138
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:58,580
Well, cowboy, I've got a case for you

139
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:02,114
that might be just what we both need.

140
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,119
Interpol paid me a visit today.

141
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:09,535
And, you lucky stiff, I'm
gonna send you over there.

142
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,489
Me?

143
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,500
What's the op?

144
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,540
Something about illegal movies.

145
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,706
Sounds like some pretty light stuff

146
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:20,114
compared to what you do
around here every day.

147
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,448
Where's over there?

148
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:23,157
My luck it'll be Jersey.

149
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,036
No, it's better than Jersey.

150
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:25,864
Thailand.

151
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,289
Bangkok to be exact.

152
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,568
They want you to pose as a fighter

153
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,165
so the bad guys will
pick you for their movie.

154
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,447
Sounds like fun, gives you a
chance to get away from here.

155
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:37,476
Look, I'm right in the
middle of a case here, cap.

156
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,114
I don't think.

157
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,449
Nobody pays you to think, Jake.

158
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:42,749
The timing on this is great.

159
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:43,743
We all need a break.

160
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,949
I'm not going to Thailand.

161
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:47,373
Relax.

162
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,370
Whatever you're into I'll
arrange to have covered.

163
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,494
It's a dream assignment for Christ sake.

164
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,286
Not in Thailand, it's not.

165
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,368
Jake, take the file and tapes.

166
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,825
Go home, study them first
before you do anything

167
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:06,239
as fucking stupid as
disobeying a direct order.

168
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:07,458
You got that?

169
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,116
I'm not going to Thailand.

170
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,333
You got that?

171
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:21,329
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

172
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:22,542
Take it easy, Jake.

173
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,250
Hi, Jackson.

174
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,365
Just you and me, huh?

175
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,082
This is what we fight against

176
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:30,248
and why we will win.

177
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:40,909
Looks like a Bruce
Lee movie without Bruce.

178
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Shit.

179
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,286
What a waste of time.

180
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,574
Yeah, this guy's pretty good.

181
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,785
Yeah, donahue.

182
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:25,998
Jake?

183
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,601
Yeah, I just called to let you know

184
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,492
that you're off the hook
on this Thailand thing.

185
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,790
I've assigned Murphy to it.

186
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,705
Yes, interpol.

187
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:34,827
No!

188
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,824
It's my assignment!

189
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,157
I'm g o ing!

190
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,455
Jake.

191
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:40,952
I said, I'm going!

192
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Jake?

193
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,118
You Anderson?

194
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,698
River's calm tonight.

195
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:45,917
Christ.

196
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,661
Do I look like a thai in disguise?

197
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,083
Yours?

198
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,331
At least you got that right.

199
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:54,542
You got a problem?

200
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,286
Don't do a cloak and dagger.

201
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,910
We don't have the time, Anderson.

202
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,456
The longer I sit here with you,

203
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:01,749
the more of a chance we
have of getting nailed.

204
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,118
You're paranoid.

205
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,665
I'm still alive which
is more than I can say

206
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,786
for the men you've already sent in.

207
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:08,952
Okay.

208
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,448
Here are the rest of the files
you received from New York.

209
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,116
Now the deaths of these
films are for real.

210
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,915
That's where the action in the market is.

211
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:19,875
Business is very good,
but to meet the demand,

212
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,914
somebody's gotta get killed.

213
00:21:21,917 --> 00:21:24,454
Yeah, all foreigners.

214
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:25,702
Unfortunately.

215
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,453
The oriental market is the biggest.

216
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:29,203
They like to see foreign blood.

217
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:30,031
Jesus.

218
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,786
I thought they were sick in the city.

219
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Tell me about it.

220
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,968
We'll meet once a week
for a progress report.

221
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:35,864
We'll get you all set up.

222
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:36,788
Hold it, hold it.

223
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,912
I appreciate your plan,
but it's not gonna work.

224
00:21:39,917 --> 00:21:42,579
Jake, you haven't heard the plan yet.

225
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,199
Has anything you set up worked before?

226
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:46,913
Yeah.

227
00:21:46,917 --> 00:21:50,284
People get killed doing it
your way, so I have an idea.

228
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,161
Let's try something different, okay?

229
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:54,077
Are you finished yet?

230
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,870
No, I'm just getting started, Anderson.

231
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,698
This is deep cover, okay?

232
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,407
Just let me do my job.

233
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,822
Stay the fuck away from
me and I'll get 'em.

234
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:05,327
A little dangerous, baby.

235
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,619
That's why I get the big salary.

236
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:10,700
I heard you're unorthodoxed, but good.

237
00:22:10,917 --> 00:22:11,531
Yeah.

238
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,115
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

239
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,369
Anderson, we're professionals, right?

240
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:17,322
Don't take it personally.

241
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:18,782
I don't take anything personal.

242
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,789
Just get the motherfuckers.

243
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,740
Don't worry, I plan to.

244
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,368
Anything else I can do for you?

245
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:28,329
Jake.

246
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,536
I still haven't seen the script.

247
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:43,407
What's going on in this scene?

248
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:46,328
We're starting with action.

249
00:22:46,542 --> 00:22:47,542
Nevermind.

250
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:50,124
Walk on the set like
you're stalking an enemy.

251
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:51,072
He should do very well.

252
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,950
He's a very accomplished fighter.

253
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:54,826
Yes, indeed.

254
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,122
Indeed.

255
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,040
Bring me some fresh blood, Mr. mckinney.

256
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:02,413
Without talent, we have nothing.

257
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:03,625
No problem.

258
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,081
What about the choreography?

259
00:23:05,292 --> 00:23:07,704
Isn't someone gonna set
the movements for us?

260
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:09,657
Dan, you told me you could handle this.

261
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:10,875
Of course I can.

262
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:12,083
It's no problem.

263
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,161
Ah, one question.

264
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:28,323
Should 1 be really hitting
them, like, in full contact?

265
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:29,327
Not at the beginning.

266
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:30,952
I'll clue you.

267
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:32,767
Just fight 'em like you would in real...

268
00:23:32,792 --> 00:23:33,792
In practice.

269
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:34,833
With speed.

270
00:23:35,917 --> 00:23:36,917
Ready?

271
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:39,914
Go in, Dan.

272
00:23:46,042 --> 00:23:46,872
Shit.

273
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,456
He really hit me.

274
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:50,123
It was an accident, Dan.

275
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:51,333
Keep going.

276
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:52,417
We're rolling.

277
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,115
What's going on?

278
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:04,333
Looks great, looks great.

279
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:05,455
Don't stop.

280
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:09,667
How's that?

281
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:11,369
Look good on film?

282
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,414
Jesus, how am I
supposed to work tomorrow?

283
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:14,956
You don't have to work tomorrow.

284
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:16,167
But my schedule says.

285
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,750
Ah, shit!

286
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:30,583
You fucker!

287
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,162
I don't write them, I just shoot them.

288
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:34,989
Come on.

289
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:36,948
What the fuck are you waiting for?

290
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:39,579
Okay, let's make magic.

291
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:40,792
Come on.

292
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,786
They're waiting for me.

293
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:10,744
Good afternoon, master.

294
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,742
I am but a lowly teacher.

295
00:26:14,958 --> 00:26:15,743
Not matter.

296
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:17,869
What can I do for you?

297
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,290
I heard your school
is the best in Bangkok.

298
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,706
Best in Thailand.

299
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:30,039
Best in the world.

300
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,115
I wanted to see what
real kickboxing was like.

301
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:50,869
What are you saying?

302
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:58,324
To tell you the truth,
I'm a little disappointed.

303
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:01,664
Your students wouldn't last five minutes

304
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:03,081
in the streets of New York.

305
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,287
I thought I'd find good fighters
here, but where are they?

306
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,434
Where are the fighters
that Thailand is known for?

307
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:12,823
They sure as hell aren't here.

308
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,956
Two at once, huh?

309
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:34,873
At least it evens the odds a little.

310
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:03,375
Who's next?

311
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:06,788
How about you, pops?

312
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:12,833
Hey, hey!

313
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,498
Hey, come on!

314
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:17,494
You want some of this?

315
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:18,708
Huh?

316
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:30,157
This is a training school,

317
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,123
not the place for a street fight.

318
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:33,333
You leave now.

319
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,947
Shit, what a fucking waste of time.

320
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:01,248
I have to go.

321
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:03,824
Aw, why don't you stay a while?

322
00:30:04,042 --> 00:30:06,704
Li have some business to attend to.

323
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:07,708
Well.

324
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:33,369
Now, she's real gorgeous.

325
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:34,583
Big tits.

326
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:41,285
As a reward, Khan, I
give you your choice.

327
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,500
Pick one.

328
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:08,703
All the women are beautiful,

329
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:12,998
but I want her.

330
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:16,414
You've gotta be kidding.

331
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,241
You have more taste than
I gave you credit for.

332
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,250
Thank you, ladies.

333
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:27,703
You will be with Khan tonight.

334
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:28,917
Uh-uh.

335
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:30,083
No way.

336
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:31,407
I'd rather be bludgeoned.

337
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:33,081
I'm out of here.

338
00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:35,499
Whatever happened to consenting adults?

339
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:37,244
You have no choice.

340
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,615
Khan has chosen you.

341
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:39,948
You will go with him.

342
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:41,167
Like hell.

343
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,698
Take your hands off of me!

344
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:45,498
I love women of fire.

345
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:47,915
Why can't thai women be like that?

346
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:51,537
Take your hands off of me!

347
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,750
God!

348
00:32:10,542 --> 00:32:12,157
You're very strong.

349
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:20,915
I must wash for you before.

350
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:24,574
You are not thai.

351
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:26,494
How do you know the custom?

352
00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:29,578
I must be clean for you.

353
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:37,448
I won't be long.

354
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,615
That's him.

355
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:18,206
Come out now!

356
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,417
Come out!

357
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:33,667
She's gone!

358
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:35,831
What?

359
00:33:36,042 --> 00:33:38,033
Come on, let's get her!

360
00:33:40,292 --> 00:33:42,248
Find her and bring her to me.

361
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,410
Is there a problem, Khan?

362
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:52,914
No problem.

363
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,500
Help!

364
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:58,498
Help!

365
00:33:58,708 --> 00:34:00,448
Get back here!

366
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:02,907
After her!

367
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:08,165
Get her!

368
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:45,907
Hey, hey, hey.

369
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:49,249
This bitch isn't bad.

370
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:52,040
You guys mind if I get in
on some of this action?

371
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:58,036
Take it easy, you guys.

372
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,660
I can go second or third.

373
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:02,161
You boys want it you're
gonna have to bleed to get it.

374
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:04,579
Ooh, I can tell you boys are
gonna need help on this one.

375
00:35:21,292 --> 00:35:23,123
Hey, you got me, man.

376
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,500
I surrender.

377
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:27,789
Take me to your leader.

378
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:43,573
Great!

379
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:44,827
Li needed that.

380
00:35:47,542 --> 00:35:49,123
Hi, my name's Jake.

381
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:50,698
You come here often?

382
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:53,032
My major's sociology.

383
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,206
I'm doing a study in human nature.

384
00:36:03,917 --> 00:36:04,917
My name's Molly.

385
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:24,623
Ah, feels better.

386
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:33,292
What are you doing?

387
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:36,083
Oh, yeah.

388
00:36:38,167 --> 00:36:39,447
I guess it's just second nature.

389
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,500
I'm sorry.

390
00:36:41,042 --> 00:36:42,042
You a cop?

391
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,740
Used to be.

392
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:46,289
I'm a fighter now.

393
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,706
It's a lot safer, no guns.

394
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,582
Give me a little credit, will ya?

395
00:36:53,792 --> 00:36:55,498
What are you doing in Bangkok, sailor?

396
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:56,322
I'll tell you later.

397
00:36:56,542 --> 00:36:58,328
Why don't you fill in the details for me?

398
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,453
Tell me what you know.

399
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:04,374
You're a nice girl from a
small town in Pennsylvania.

400
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:08,324
You came here to be a
model, maybe an actress.

401
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:13,408
But 1 don't think it worked
out quite like you planned.

402
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,741
Now you don't want to stay
here, but you can't go home.

403
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:19,625
How's that?

404
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:23,375
Pretty good.

405
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:25,865
Tell fortunes, too?

406
00:37:28,917 --> 00:37:31,078
So, what do you think I'm doing now?

407
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:32,748
Picking fights late at night.

408
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:37,866
I think they stole your dreams, Molly.

409
00:37:38,792 --> 00:37:40,748
They took advantage of a good person.

410
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:43,123
They deserve to be punished.

411
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:47,824
And who's gonna do the punishing, you?

412
00:37:48,042 --> 00:37:49,042
I just might.

413
00:37:49,917 --> 00:37:52,454
My crusade card's a little
booked right now though.

414
00:37:55,042 --> 00:37:57,203
Okay, your turn.

415
00:37:58,417 --> 00:37:59,417
You promised.

416
00:38:04,292 --> 00:38:06,203
I'm trying to find somebody.

417
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:07,417
Who?

418
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:10,875
An old friend.

419
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:13,042
Glad we just met.

420
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,167
Can I help?

421
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:19,290
After all, I owe you.

422
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:22,958
Maybe.

423
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
We'll see.

424
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:14,698
Looking for me, huh?

425
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:19,203
What the hell do you think you're doing?

426
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,286
I've seen you before, right?

427
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:26,498
Yeah, at the kickboxing school.

428
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:30,083
You're following me?

429
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:32,164
A regular Joe looking for a fight?

430
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:33,740
You are no ordinary fighter.

431
00:39:33,958 --> 00:39:35,243
Thanks for the compliment.

432
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:37,619
I'll give you the address to my fan club.

433
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,073
It's not meant as a compliment.

434
00:39:39,292 --> 00:39:40,452
You're not here for a fight.

435
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:41,827
You're after something else.

436
00:39:42,042 --> 00:39:43,157
And what would that be?

437
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:44,080
You tell me.

438
00:39:44,292 --> 00:39:45,782
Wrong answer, pal.

439
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,036
I'm just here to make
some money in the ring.

440
00:39:51,417 --> 00:39:52,782
You don't stand a chance.

441
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:55,792
You were at the school.

442
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:58,199
You saw what I did to those three guys.

443
00:39:58,417 --> 00:40:00,453
You have never faced a real kickboxing.

444
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:02,658
And who's gonna show it to me, you?

445
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:05,202
If you wish.

446
00:40:07,792 --> 00:40:09,828
All right, come on.

447
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:11,907
I don't wanna hurt ya.

448
00:40:13,583 --> 00:40:15,164
I's not me who will be hurt.

449
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,615
Do you see what I mean?

450
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:39,040
And I'm not even
considered a good fighter.

451
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:42,663
You go up against a professional,
you get hurt permanently.

452
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,615
Why are you doing this?

453
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:47,993
Why are you here?

454
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:51,123
I told you.

455
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:52,413
I'm looking for a fight.

456
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:56,541
But after what you just
did to me, I gotta admit,

457
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:59,492
I'm gonna need something
if I'm gonna beat him.

458
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,500
Beat who?

459
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,500
Khan.

460
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:24,414
You are no match for him.

461
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:25,625
He will destroy you.

462
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:30,743
No great loss, right?

463
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:32,744
Just another goddamn American farang.

464
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:33,958
Thanks for nothing.

465
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:34,952
Wait.

466
00:41:35,167 --> 00:41:37,123
Why, you wanna show me some more moves?

467
00:41:38,042 --> 00:41:39,873
I know a fighter, a master.

468
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,157
Who?

469
00:41:44,375 --> 00:41:45,831
His name is prang.

470
00:41:46,042 --> 00:41:47,407
He fought Khan.

471
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:50,207
The only one who came
close to beating him.

472
00:41:50,417 --> 00:41:51,748
Had him beaten.

473
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,706
Prang is a recluse now.

474
00:41:53,917 --> 00:41:55,999
Wants nothing to do with the world.

475
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:57,208
Who does?

476
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:00,327
Why are you helping me?

477
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:04,415
I hate to see helpless Americans.

478
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:05,625
Know many?

479
00:42:05,708 --> 00:42:06,708
My father.

480
00:42:13,417 --> 00:42:15,328
Can you tell me where he is?

481
00:42:15,542 --> 00:42:19,160
He lives north of
Bangkok in a small village

482
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:22,208
along the bank of minam river.

483
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:23,417
He's a hermit.

484
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:27,413
He could help you prepare
for Khan if he's willing.

485
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:28,625
He may not be.

486
00:43:35,542 --> 00:43:37,373
Drunk at this hour of the morning?

487
00:43:37,583 --> 00:43:38,583
Excuse me.

488
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:41,865
I'm looking for a man called prang.

489
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:43,414
Is this where he lives?

490
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,500
Yes.

491
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,831
Is he home?

492
00:43:50,042 --> 00:43:51,042
No!

493
00:43:53,708 --> 00:43:55,448
Well, do you know him?

494
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:57,203
1 know him well.

495
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:01,198
Very well.

496
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:04,998
What do you want?

497
00:44:05,917 --> 00:44:06,917
It's personal.

498
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:10,240
Look, tell me when he's gonna be home.

499
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:12,198
Li must talk to him.

500
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:14,328
He will be home when I...

501
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:19,789
When he get here.

502
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
You're him?

503
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:39,083
You're prang?

504
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:41,832
One of Thailand's greatest fighters?

505
00:44:42,042 --> 00:44:43,248
Go away.

506
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:44,868
Nobody want you here.

507
00:44:45,792 --> 00:44:47,748
You know what's funny?

508
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:49,365
I came out here on that boat to ask you

509
00:44:49,583 --> 00:44:51,494
to train me, to teach me.

510
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:55,456
All you could teach me
is what life looks like

511
00:44:55,667 --> 00:44:57,282
from the inside of a bottle.

512
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,706
Doesn't look too bad.

513
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:05,250
I bet it doesn't.

514
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:09,909
But I'm gonna need more than
that to solve my problems.

515
00:45:16,292 --> 00:45:18,408
I thought you'd be the answer.

516
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:19,455
It was a good joke.

517
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:20,458
I gotta admit that.

518
00:45:22,417 --> 00:45:24,203
Goodbye, master.

519
00:45:24,417 --> 00:45:26,248
Good riddance.

520
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:47,537
This one right here.

521
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:06,875
Beautiful.

522
00:46:07,708 --> 00:46:09,448
It's a masterpiece.

523
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:12,158
It will be our most successful yet.

524
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:13,740
Congratulations.

525
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:15,494
It's not enough.

526
00:46:15,708 --> 00:46:17,073
We can do better.

527
00:46:17,292 --> 00:46:18,577
How's that?

528
00:46:18,792 --> 00:46:22,614
We need more tension, more people.

529
00:46:23,667 --> 00:46:25,373
What do you have in mind, Khan?

530
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:27,039
You want to fight more than one?

531
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:32,290
I once killed a man while
his young brother watched.

532
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,124
If we can...

533
00:46:37,333 --> 00:46:40,951
Yes, I think I know what you mean.

534
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:46,207
If we involve people that
the fighters cared about,

535
00:46:46,417 --> 00:46:49,534
think of the possibilities, the pathos,

536
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:53,283
and the look on their faces when they see

537
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,500
their loved ones killed.

538
00:46:54,542 --> 00:46:56,874
It will add a dimension
we've never had before.

539
00:46:57,083 --> 00:46:58,083
It's beautiful.

540
00:46:58,292 --> 00:46:59,292
A stroke of genius.

541
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:01,865
I love it, Khan.

542
00:47:02,083 --> 00:47:03,083
Let's do it.

543
00:47:03,292 --> 00:47:05,408
Mr. mckinney, it's up to
you to find us what we need.

544
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:07,661
I'm aware of that, but
it shouldn't be too hard.

545
00:47:07,875 --> 00:47:10,207
In fact, I already have somebody in mind.

546
00:47:10,417 --> 00:47:12,658
I've just misplaced him for the moment.

547
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:13,739
Well, get to work.

548
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,786
The sooner we can pull this together,

549
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,786
the sooner we can go into production.

550
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:18,705
Thank you, Khan.

551
00:47:18,917 --> 00:47:20,282
Keep up the good work.

552
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,572
Oh, by the way, have you
found your sweet lady?

553
00:47:23,583 --> 00:47:25,414
Not yet.

554
00:47:25,417 --> 00:47:26,577
Imagine that.

555
00:47:26,792 --> 00:47:27,998
The world's fiercest killer

556
00:47:28,208 --> 00:47:30,164
and he can't keep a woman in his own bed.

557
00:47:31,083 --> 00:47:32,744
We ought to make a movie out of that.

558
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:00,032
Go away!

559
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,250
Shit.

560
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:09,245
You mean, you could've
helped me out any time?

561
00:49:09,458 --> 00:49:10,538
You were doing fine.

562
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,581
I almost got killed for you.

563
00:49:14,458 --> 00:49:16,449
Nobody asked for your help.

564
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:17,827
I told you to go away.

565
00:49:19,417 --> 00:49:22,534
When I started fighting
'em, why didn't you jump in?

566
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:25,162
I wanted to see how good you were.

567
00:49:25,375 --> 00:49:26,375
You're not bad.

568
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:28,163
Give me a break.

569
00:49:29,417 --> 00:49:32,659
Besides, I had 'em right
where I wanted 'em.

570
00:49:33,583 --> 00:49:35,539
Give me a break.

571
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:36,750
You're pretty good.

572
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:39,164
Even I believed you were drunk.

573
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:41,833
Impressive.

574
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,661
I've had years of practice.

575
00:49:46,875 --> 00:49:48,615
I guess you were looking for this.

576
00:49:49,625 --> 00:49:51,365
My monkey took it from your bag.

577
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:53,250
I'm sorry.

578
00:49:54,167 --> 00:49:55,167
Thanks.

579
00:49:58,042 --> 00:50:00,408
Well, I guess you have
a good reason for this.

580
00:50:00,625 --> 00:50:03,037
I don't understand it, but I respect it.

581
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,865
I'll leave you alone.

582
00:50:05,083 --> 00:50:06,744
Are you sure you have to run off?

583
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:10,741
Why, you got some other
guys you want me to fight?

584
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:12,869
I'd like to invite you to dinner.

585
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,331
Don't you want to be left alone?

586
00:50:15,542 --> 00:50:16,657
I'd like to talk to you.

587
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:23,707
I hope you're serving monkey meat.

588
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:46,489
I had him beaten, but my
concentration was broken

589
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:49,953
as well as four of my ribs.

590
00:51:22,792 --> 00:51:27,286
I recovered and I've lived
like this ever since.

591
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,706
Why the drunk act?

592
00:51:33,833 --> 00:51:35,494
I was a threat to Khan.

593
00:51:38,125 --> 00:51:41,617
But a drunken hermit
is a threat to no one.

594
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:49,577
Revenge was on my mind for
a time, but that passed.

595
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:58,163
I am not proud of what I have become.

596
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:02,828
You're still one hell of a fighter.

597
00:52:05,792 --> 00:52:08,158
What are you doing
back here in Thailand?

598
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:18,323
10 years ago I turned and ran.

599
00:52:20,375 --> 00:52:21,375
Leaving my...

600
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:26,871
My brother dead in a gutter.

601
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:30,869
I convinced myself that Khan didn't matter

602
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:34,119
until I saw him in that film.

603
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:38,448
I won't run away again.

604
00:52:39,833 --> 00:52:43,621
He won't stop at just a scar this time.

605
00:52:43,833 --> 00:52:44,538
You beat him.

606
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:45,409
You can help me.

607
00:52:45,417 --> 00:52:47,032
Teach me to stop him.

608
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:48,490
Is your goal to kill him?

609
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:51,373
I will not teach a murderer.

610
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,244
Would you rather teach a liar?

611
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:56,575
His one technique is unstoppable.

612
00:52:57,958 --> 00:53:01,200
What I have to offer might not be enough.

613
00:53:01,417 --> 00:53:02,417
It has to be.

614
00:53:04,667 --> 00:53:08,740
I have to face him and I have to win,

615
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:12,871
for myself, you, and for my brother.

616
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,831
We start tomorrow.

617
00:53:19,292 --> 00:53:20,292
With what?

618
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:23,414
Your reeducation.

619
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:25,581
We have a lot of work to do.

620
00:53:25,583 --> 00:53:26,583
Thank you.

621
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:30,165
I do it for myself, too.

622
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:33,412
Besides, you won't be
thanking me tomorrow.

623
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:34,865
We go to bed now.

624
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:38,324
Touch me in the night and I'll kill you.

625
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:40,574
The monkey love that kind of talk.

626
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:10,833
Time to get up.

627
00:54:46,542 --> 00:54:49,864
Using your knee, break all of these.

628
00:54:50,083 --> 00:54:51,083
These?

629
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:53,831
It's gonna hurt.

630
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:55,198
Pain doesn't exist.

631
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,532
You keep saying that,

632
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:58,957
but 1 don't see you out
here breaking these things.

633
00:55:12,917 --> 00:55:14,248
Bondage, prang?

634
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:15,990
I didn't know you were into that.

635
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,740
Prang, this isn't funny.

636
00:55:24,042 --> 00:55:24,906
Hey!

637
00:55:24,917 --> 00:55:27,374
Let me down!

638
00:55:27,583 --> 00:55:29,790
Your weakest point is your legs.

639
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,160
Khan will attack them.

640
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:34,664
So I must attack them first!

641
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,661
Hey!

642
00:55:41,875 --> 00:55:42,910
Hey, let me down!

643
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,865
Goddamn it!

644
00:55:50,375 --> 00:55:52,081
Please, let me down!

645
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:57,119
Hey, let me down!

646
00:55:58,292 --> 00:56:00,078
I'll be back soon.

647
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,911
Please, let me down!

648
00:56:07,792 --> 00:56:12,991
Hey, hey!

649
00:56:30,833 --> 00:56:31,833
Whoa!

650
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,082
You must be ready for anything.

651
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:38,908
I was just washing my
face for Christ sake.

652
00:56:39,125 --> 00:56:41,867
For Khan's sake stay aware.

653
00:56:55,917 --> 00:56:57,657
You're not hitting me with that.

654
00:56:57,667 --> 00:57:00,830
Thai proverb say
success come through pain.

655
00:57:50,792 --> 00:57:54,114
The point of all this
training is to prepare you

656
00:57:54,333 --> 00:57:57,040
for Khan's most deadly technique.

657
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:58,911
A series of three kicks.

658
00:58:34,208 --> 00:58:36,574
Hear the sound of one hand clapping.

659
00:58:36,792 --> 00:58:38,953
What the hell does this stuff mean?

660
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:41,934
That's the trouble 1 always
have with the orient.

661
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:43,073
This mystical shit.

662
00:58:44,417 --> 00:58:45,782
You really know what it means?

663
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Of course.

664
00:58:47,083 --> 00:58:48,198
Okay, tell me.

665
00:58:48,417 --> 00:58:49,577
Doesn't work that way.

666
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:52,078
Have to find out for yourself.

667
00:58:52,083 --> 00:58:52,868
Bullshit.

668
00:58:53,083 --> 00:58:53,788
You don't know.

669
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,240
Do, too.

670
00:58:55,458 --> 00:58:57,073
Now, get back to your meditation.

671
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:00,661
I'm listening to a fucking drunk.

672
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:02,581
Worthless piece of shit American.

673
00:59:02,792 --> 00:59:03,792
I heard that.

674
00:59:03,917 --> 00:59:05,999
I wanted you to.

675
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:07,789
Asshole.

676
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,910
Why you stop?

677
00:59:36,125 --> 00:59:38,787
If this is your idea of
training, you're crazy.

678
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,662
You want to be ready
for Khan, then keep going.

679
00:59:41,667 --> 00:59:43,123
Forget about it.

680
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:44,823
All this shit's doing is burning

681
00:59:45,042 --> 00:59:46,578
what little time I have left.

682
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:48,202
This is the way that I learned.

683
00:59:48,417 --> 00:59:50,749
Yeah, and how far did that get ya?

684
00:59:50,958 --> 00:59:51,958
What?

685
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
You lost.

686
00:59:55,042 --> 00:59:56,202
I can't afford to lose.

687
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:25,583
Prang, I'm sorry.

688
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:28,789
I didn't mean it that way.

689
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:30,833
It's okay.

690
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:33,198
I did lose.

691
01:00:33,417 --> 01:00:34,953
That's not the version I heard.

692
01:00:37,042 --> 01:00:40,079
I just don't want to blow this
chance at Khan, that's all.

693
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:42,782
I apologize for what I said.

694
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,991
Without your help I don't stand a chance.

695
01:00:48,042 --> 01:00:49,782
We both want the same thing.

696
01:00:50,917 --> 01:00:53,624
Together we can succeed.

697
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:54,833
I know that.

698
01:00:56,875 --> 01:00:58,160
I'll do whatever you say.

699
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:01,750
Anything?

700
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:08,365
Anything you think is necessary.

701
01:01:39,583 --> 01:01:41,949
The tea master had to face the warrior

702
01:01:42,167 --> 01:01:44,328
in a fight to the death the next day.

703
01:01:45,333 --> 01:01:48,200
He went to a master swordsman for help.

704
01:01:48,417 --> 01:01:51,739
The swordsman told him there
was nothing he could teach him

705
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:54,324
that would enable him to
win against the warrior.

706
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:58,291
Then, he ask him to make tea for him.

707
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:02,621
While the tea master prepared the teq,

708
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:05,415
he was completely concentrated.

709
01:02:05,625 --> 01:02:06,910
Nothing else intruded.

710
01:02:07,125 --> 01:02:08,365
Nothing else existed.

711
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:14,415
When the tea was done,
the swordsman smiled.

712
01:02:14,625 --> 01:02:19,369
He said, tomorrow face
the warrior sword in hand

713
01:02:19,958 --> 01:02:21,914
with the same attitude.

714
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:24,787
Your mind empty, ready to face death.

715
01:02:26,625 --> 01:02:29,788
When the warrior saw that the tea master

716
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,448
was completely ready to
die, he turned and ran away.

717
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,369
The warrior who clings
to life will surly die.

718
01:02:41,583 --> 01:02:45,326
He who embraces death will survive.

719
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,865
Do you see what I mean?

720
01:02:48,083 --> 01:02:49,198
Yeah, I think so.

721
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:52,490
You want me to learn to make tea.

722
01:02:54,083 --> 01:02:56,699
Even you could not be so stupid.

723
01:02:57,583 --> 01:03:00,120
I have in many ways
been running from death,

724
01:03:00,333 --> 01:03:02,619
while at the same time
hoping for it to find me.

725
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:05,745
It's been 10 years now and
death is just around the corner.

726
01:03:07,167 --> 01:03:09,032
I'm ready to face it.

727
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:09,864
Li don't fear it.

728
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:13,246
Then you stand a chance against Khan.

729
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:15,490
Your only chance.

730
01:04:33,167 --> 01:04:34,167
You with him?

731
01:04:35,083 --> 01:04:35,868
Yes.

732
01:04:36,083 --> 01:04:37,083
Jake sent me a letter.

733
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:38,208
Life isn't fair.

734
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:41,077
How's he doing?

735
01:04:41,083 --> 01:04:42,243
He's training hard.

736
01:04:43,833 --> 01:04:45,824
He could use a break from the routine.

737
01:04:46,875 --> 01:04:49,491
But he must stay focused, concentrated.

738
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:51,993
Don't worry, he will.

739
01:04:55,833 --> 01:04:57,243
Hey, Jake!

740
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:58,490
Hey, Jake.

741
01:04:58,708 --> 01:04:59,708
Yeah.

742
01:04:59,917 --> 01:05:00,576
That's it.

743
01:05:00,792 --> 01:05:02,123
Your lesson's over.

744
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:03,413
But I'm not finished yet.

745
01:05:03,625 --> 01:05:04,785
You always argue.

746
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,956
I let up and still you give me shit.

747
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:09,078
Into the water with your sorry ass.

748
01:05:09,292 --> 01:05:10,292
Okay.

749
01:05:22,583 --> 01:05:23,368
Ah, prang.

750
01:05:23,583 --> 01:05:24,914
My legs feel so much better.

751
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:29,458
Prang?

752
01:05:30,667 --> 01:05:31,667
Prang.

753
01:05:31,792 --> 01:05:32,832
I don't see anything wrong

754
01:05:32,875 --> 01:05:33,875
with your legs, big boy.

755
01:05:34,833 --> 01:05:35,913
Molly.

756
01:05:36,125 --> 01:05:38,241
Expecting someone else?

757
01:05:38,458 --> 01:05:39,664
Prang.

758
01:05:39,875 --> 01:05:41,365
Oh, something you haven't told me

759
01:05:41,583 --> 01:05:42,914
about you and prang, huh?

760
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:48,789
Get back in the tub.

761
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:49,614
But.

762
01:05:49,833 --> 01:05:53,121
Don't worry, you're
not breaking training.

763
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:54,573
I'm here with prang's blessing.

764
01:05:54,708 --> 01:05:55,914
That dirty old man.

765
01:05:56,833 --> 01:05:58,164
What do you have in mind?

766
01:05:59,042 --> 01:06:02,990
Poor boy has been working so hard.

767
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,366
I think you should have
a message, don't you?

768
01:06:06,417 --> 01:06:07,417
Oh, yes.

769
01:06:07,458 --> 01:06:08,458
Definitely yes.

770
01:06:09,292 --> 01:06:10,953
Ever had a thai body message?

771
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:11,781
No.

772
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,365
What do I have to do?

773
01:06:13,583 --> 01:06:14,948
Just concentrate.

774
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:10,994
Yeah?

775
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:49,494
Sure you can beat this guy?

776
01:08:50,708 --> 01:08:52,323
No such thing as bad students.

777
01:08:52,542 --> 01:08:53,622
Only bad teachers.

778
01:08:54,583 --> 01:08:57,416
If 1 can't, there's only
one person to blame.

779
01:08:57,625 --> 01:08:58,831
Yeah, her.

780
01:08:59,042 --> 01:09:01,033
Hey, I'm concentrating.

781
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:08,309
You want me to play
with him a little while

782
01:09:08,333 --> 01:09:09,948
or take him out quick?

783
01:09:10,167 --> 01:09:13,204
Show your stuff, but do what we planned.

784
01:09:13,208 --> 01:09:14,448
I'll tell you when.

785
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:28,666
How many of these guys
you figure I have to fight?

786
01:09:28,875 --> 01:09:30,411
How many you want?

787
01:09:45,083 --> 01:09:47,324
You, American!

788
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:49,824
Come on!

789
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Okay?

790
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,250
Come on!

791
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:07,538
Come on!

792
01:11:21,375 --> 01:11:22,911
No, no, no, no, no.

793
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:24,490
No, no, no, no.

794
01:11:25,708 --> 01:11:26,708
Come with me.

795
01:11:26,917 --> 01:11:28,237
You're through for the afternoon.

796
01:11:28,292 --> 01:11:29,782
Bullshit, I won.

797
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,331
Trust me, this is more important.

798
01:11:31,542 --> 01:11:34,614
Besides, I'm gonna make
it worth your while.

799
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:36,698
Let's find...

800
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,197
Let's find a place where we can talk.

801
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:46,750
This better be good.

802
01:11:46,792 --> 01:11:48,999
I just made about 200 bucks.

803
01:11:49,208 --> 01:11:52,496
If it's not, you can
always come back out.

804
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:53,500
True.

805
01:11:53,583 --> 01:11:54,583
Lead on.

806
01:12:06,833 --> 01:12:10,155
I didn't want you to waste
your time with rabble, Jake.

807
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:11,375
Are you a promoter?

808
01:12:11,542 --> 01:12:12,156
Better.

809
01:12:12,375 --> 01:12:13,706
I work with a production company.

810
01:12:14,625 --> 01:12:18,573
Movies, my boy,
and I can make you a star.

811
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:20,423
Well, 1 appreciate your
interest, Mr. mckinney,

812
01:12:20,542 --> 01:12:21,998
but I'm a fighter, not an actor.

813
01:12:22,958 --> 01:12:26,325
We need a fighter, but
we'll pay you as an actor.

814
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,831
How much does an actor get paid?

815
01:12:33,833 --> 01:12:35,323
20,000.

816
01:12:35,333 --> 01:12:36,743
Us?

817
01:12:36,958 --> 01:12:39,040
Of course, and that's just a start.

818
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:40,581
It's only the beginning, Jake.

819
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:45,666
Don't I have to take a
screen test or something?

820
01:12:45,667 --> 01:12:46,907
No, no.

821
01:12:46,917 --> 01:12:48,748
I've seen all I need to see.

822
01:12:50,375 --> 01:12:53,242
Hey, I shouldn't have to sell this to you.

823
01:12:53,458 --> 01:12:54,117
There are plenty.

824
01:12:54,333 --> 01:12:55,333
No, no.

825
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:56,500
1 want to do it.

826
01:12:57,083 --> 01:12:58,914
So, who will I be working with?

827
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,365
Anybody famous?

828
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:03,655
Van damme, Norris, Jackie chan?

829
01:13:03,875 --> 01:13:05,661
We don't want anybody to upstage you.

830
01:13:05,875 --> 01:13:07,160
It's your gig.

831
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:08,581
Upstage, gig?

832
01:13:08,792 --> 01:13:09,792
Is this really happening?

833
01:13:09,875 --> 01:13:10,660
I'm gonna be the star?

834
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:12,991
It's the chance of a lifetime,

835
01:13:13,208 --> 01:13:14,684
but you have to keep it under your hat.

836
01:13:14,708 --> 01:13:17,040
If you don't, you'll blow it.

837
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:19,206
Don't even tell that fine lady out there.

838
01:13:20,292 --> 01:13:21,782
1 won't tell a soul.

839
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Honest.

840
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:27,037
After all, I haven't been
here in Bangkok that long.

841
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:28,250
Who would I tell?

842
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Okay.

843
01:13:32,042 --> 01:13:33,042
It's a deal.

844
01:13:34,167 --> 01:13:36,249
Report to this address tomorrow morning.

845
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:42,703
I'll be there.

846
01:13:42,917 --> 01:13:45,499
You can count on me, Mr. mckinney.

847
01:13:45,708 --> 01:13:48,290
I knew I could, kid.

848
01:14:08,833 --> 01:14:10,869
I'll only be gone for a little while.

849
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
When I come back.

850
01:14:13,042 --> 01:14:15,283
And take her away from all this, Jake?

851
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:20,425
Anderson, I thought you
were better than this.

852
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:24,666
We did have a deal, but new
information's come to light.

853
01:14:27,792 --> 01:14:29,657
Would you excuse us, my dear?

854
01:14:43,375 --> 01:14:44,375
She's cute.

855
01:14:45,667 --> 01:14:46,747
You've been a busy boy.

856
01:14:46,958 --> 01:14:47,572
Huh, Jake?

857
01:14:47,792 --> 01:14:49,373
Put your gonads on hold, Anderson.

858
01:14:49,583 --> 01:14:50,663
You got something for me?

859
01:14:52,458 --> 01:14:53,413
I do.

860
01:14:53,417 --> 01:14:55,578
Cap, what the fuck are you doing here?

861
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:56,792
Am I dreaming?

862
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,831
I wish it was a dream, Jake.

863
01:14:58,833 --> 01:15:00,448
We know what happened 10 years ago.

864
01:15:00,667 --> 01:15:01,281
Ancient history.

865
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,410
Call the anthropologist.

866
01:15:02,417 --> 01:15:03,657
It has no bearing on this case.

867
01:15:03,875 --> 01:15:06,992
We also know that Khan was involved.

868
01:15:07,208 --> 01:15:08,744
You crossed the line, Jake.

869
01:15:08,958 --> 01:15:09,743
I'm pulling you out.

870
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:10,750
You can't.

871
01:15:10,833 --> 01:15:11,833
Pardon me?

872
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:14,914
They made contact this afternoon.

873
01:15:15,125 --> 01:15:15,739
I'm in.

874
01:15:15,958 --> 01:15:16,822
You're in?

875
01:15:16,833 --> 01:15:17,833
Yeah.

876
01:15:18,042 --> 01:15:19,407
I don't know if I should tell you guys.

877
01:15:19,417 --> 01:15:20,953
They told me to keep it quiet.

878
01:15:21,167 --> 01:15:21,781
Well?

879
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:22,659
Okay, okay.

880
01:15:22,667 --> 01:15:24,077
I guess I can trust you.

881
01:15:24,292 --> 01:15:26,578
Look, I report tomorrow
morning to be the star.

882
01:15:28,083 --> 01:15:30,825
I bought his rap hook, line, and sinker.

883
01:15:31,042 --> 01:15:33,124
You're on a plane tomorrow, Jake.

884
01:15:33,333 --> 01:15:34,333
Tell him, Anderson.

885
01:15:34,417 --> 01:15:36,203
We've never gotten
anyone this far before

886
01:15:36,417 --> 01:15:38,032
and I've already lost three men.

887
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:39,786
But I can't afford to let this go.

888
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:40,614
No.

889
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:43,745
Look, I don't have to work with you.

890
01:15:43,958 --> 01:15:46,119
I could tell you guys
to go fuck yourselves.

891
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:47,693
Disappear and you'd never find me.

892
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:50,199
Shit, Anderson and his
interpol goons couldn't stop me

893
01:15:50,417 --> 01:15:52,137
from leaving this
restaurant if I wanted to.

894
01:15:52,208 --> 01:15:53,208
You know that, cap.

895
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:58,496
I could do this on my own,
but there's another way.

896
01:15:58,500 --> 01:15:59,740
We're listening.

897
01:15:59,958 --> 01:16:01,914
He's listening, I'm seething!

898
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:03,160
Look, here's the plan.

899
01:16:03,167 --> 01:16:05,704
Keep me in and we do it together.

900
01:16:05,917 --> 01:16:09,034
I wrote down the address so
you can come watch my back.

901
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:10,831
Don't fuck with me this time, Jake.

902
01:16:11,042 --> 01:16:13,033
Cap, would I do that to you?

903
01:16:30,458 --> 01:16:32,540
So what happens tomorrow?

904
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:33,830
I face the past.

905
01:16:34,917 --> 01:16:37,329
Will you come back here to me?

906
01:16:37,542 --> 01:16:38,702
If I can.

907
01:16:41,792 --> 01:16:43,657
Can't you just walk away from it?

908
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:45,411
Let someone else handle it.

909
01:16:45,417 --> 01:16:46,953
No, I can't, okay?

910
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:51,412
It has to be me and you
have to accept that.

911
01:16:51,625 --> 01:16:52,625
What about us?

912
01:16:54,083 --> 01:16:55,483
Look, if I don't take care of this,

913
01:16:55,583 --> 01:16:56,789
us doesn't stand a chance.

914
01:16:58,333 --> 01:17:00,324
Can you understand that?

915
01:17:02,917 --> 01:17:03,917
1 think so.

916
01:17:15,042 --> 01:17:16,682
Have you heard about the football players

917
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:19,332
who won't have sex the
night before a big game?

918
01:17:20,875 --> 01:17:21,955
Sure, why?

919
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:24,956
Do you think they have a point?

920
01:17:26,042 --> 01:17:27,452
No, not really.

921
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:29,500
Good.

922
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:35,451
Jake, I'll take what I can get with you.

923
01:17:37,208 --> 01:17:39,164
And right now, I've got you.

924
01:18:34,542 --> 01:18:35,577
Don't do that.

925
01:18:37,667 --> 01:18:40,659
The superior fighter is always aware.

926
01:18:40,875 --> 01:18:41,534
The superior teacher doesn't

927
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:43,581
scare the shit out of his student.

928
01:18:43,792 --> 01:18:45,077
Let me go with you.

929
01:18:45,292 --> 01:18:46,292
No can do.

930
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:47,865
You gotta stay here and worry.

931
01:18:52,958 --> 01:18:54,494
Be careful.

932
01:18:54,708 --> 01:18:55,788
Khan can kill you.

933
01:18:56,958 --> 01:18:58,718
Aren't you supposed to
send me off confident,

934
01:18:58,833 --> 01:19:00,414
ready to take on the world?

935
01:19:00,625 --> 01:19:01,910
You know the odds.

936
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:04,161
Whatever I say can't change that.

937
01:19:04,167 --> 01:19:06,283
You got money on the other guy?

938
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:09,572
I'd put it all on you,
but who would take the bet?

939
01:19:09,792 --> 01:19:11,077
Quit trying to cheer me up.

940
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:13,786
Watch Molly for me, okay?

941
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:16,417
Thanks.

942
01:19:27,625 --> 01:19:32,824
I'd love to stay, but I've got
places to go, people to see,

943
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:38,370
and a captain that's gonna kill me.

944
01:21:50,958 --> 01:21:53,370
Jake is getting into wardrobe.

945
01:24:20,833 --> 01:24:22,039
Oh, shit.

946
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:23,250
I'm sorry.

947
01:24:24,208 --> 01:24:26,324
Hey, can we do that again?

948
01:24:26,542 --> 01:24:28,498
1 didn't mean to hit them.

949
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:29,500
No problem.

950
01:24:29,583 --> 01:24:30,288
Very realistic.

951
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:31,159
Keep it up.

952
01:24:31,375 --> 01:24:31,989
We're rolling.

953
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,831
You're doing great, Jake.

954
01:24:45,417 --> 01:24:46,702
Hey, that guy's really hurt.

955
01:24:46,917 --> 01:24:48,077
Somebody get a doctor.

956
01:24:49,375 --> 01:24:51,240
This is a little too real for me, man.

957
01:24:51,458 --> 01:24:52,458
I'm through.

958
01:24:53,708 --> 01:24:56,245
The show must go on.

959
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:21,535
Molly!

960
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:22,535
Jake.

961
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:23,750
Molly!

962
01:25:55,958 --> 01:25:58,700
I know you trained
with my old friend prang,

963
01:25:59,708 --> 01:26:02,165
but he is still no match for me.

964
01:26:06,958 --> 01:26:08,323
Jake, help me!

965
01:26:10,333 --> 01:26:11,493
Jakel

966
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:12,743
Jake, help me!

967
01:26:15,583 --> 01:26:18,996
Let the girl go!

968
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,662
She's part of the production now, Jake.

969
01:26:25,875 --> 01:26:28,537
Gives you a little more motivation.

970
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:31,207
Fight and win and you both go free.

971
01:26:31,417 --> 01:26:33,248
Life will be your prize.

972
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:41,490
Mr. mckinney, no time, no time.

973
01:26:41,708 --> 01:26:42,367
Keep it moving.

974
01:26:42,583 --> 01:26:43,583
Action!

975
01:27:04,625 --> 01:27:05,625
Move in tight.

976
01:27:17,583 --> 01:27:18,583
No, Jake!

977
01:28:14,417 --> 01:28:16,578
I know you.

978
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:18,123
You are the brother.

979
01:28:20,917 --> 01:28:22,327
How perfect.

980
01:28:26,458 --> 01:28:31,657
I will send you to hell
to join your brother.

981
01:28:33,333 --> 01:28:36,655
I've been there for 10 years.

982
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:49,241
Try this kick.

983
01:31:26,875 --> 01:31:28,615
This is for prang!

984
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:33,331
This is for Molly!

985
01:31:34,958 --> 01:31:36,949
This is for my brother!

986
01:31:42,667 --> 01:31:47,536
And this is for the life you
stole from me, you bastard!

987
01:32:01,583 --> 01:32:02,789
What do we do?

988
01:32:02,792 --> 01:32:03,907
Khan's losing.

989
01:32:04,125 --> 01:32:05,525
We knew Khan couldn't last forever.

990
01:32:05,708 --> 01:32:07,164
Keep shooting.

991
01:32:07,375 --> 01:32:08,615
He's our new star.

992
01:32:08,833 --> 01:32:10,698
Give him the closeups, Mr. director.

993
01:32:11,833 --> 01:32:14,415
Jakel

994
01:32:14,625 --> 01:32:16,991
okay.

995
01:32:39,167 --> 01:32:40,782
Are you all right?

996
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,365
Jake, 1 love you.

997
01:32:42,583 --> 01:32:43,914
Mr. director, Mr. director.

998
01:33:18,667 --> 01:33:19,667
It's the cops!

999
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:20,750
The cops!

1000
01:33:20,958 --> 01:33:21,958
Let's go!

1001
01:33:51,625 --> 01:33:52,489
Jakel

1002
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:53,330
hold it!

1003
01:33:53,333 --> 01:33:55,244
Hey, you look good, Jake.

1004
01:33:56,333 --> 01:33:57,333
Jake, Jake!

1005
01:34:04,083 --> 01:34:06,950
Cap, how'd you know?

1006
01:34:07,167 --> 01:34:08,907
You must think I'm stupid.

1007
01:34:09,125 --> 01:34:11,662
That line of crap is okay for the rookies,

1008
01:34:11,875 --> 01:34:13,456
but I'm your captain.

1009
01:34:13,667 --> 01:34:14,452
Remember that.

1010
01:34:14,667 --> 01:34:15,372
Yes, sir.

1011
01:34:15,583 --> 01:34:16,698
- Huh?
- Yes, sir.

1012
01:34:20,625 --> 01:34:21,625
Fire!

1013
01:34:24,292 --> 01:34:25,292
Fire!
