Now, you got two problems.

One, you done all your time

let me be frank with you.

We have some concerns.

37
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:54,439

We're listening.

39
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,342
WOMAN: We've read
your son's record,

40
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:00,512
and we're not convinced
that our school

41
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,548
is the right place
for a student

42
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,815
with his
particular history.

43
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,885
There are other institutions
that might be more--

Beneficial.

45
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,789

you're-you're not gonna take him?

46

Obviously we're--

47
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,659
This is a public school.

48
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:15,227
Is this--

49
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,895
WOMAN: Experiences of abuse
that your son endured,

50
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:21,767
but the fact is
that James has a record

51
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:25,470
of unstable,
even violent behaviour.

52
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:26,805
He could be a danger
to the other children.

00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:46,325

00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:12,911
Huh?

184
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,714
Wanna make this about us,
or what?

185
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:17,015
Nah.

186
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:19,818
I'm just wondering why
a bigger mano like you

187
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,153
only has the heart
to fuck with the punks.

188
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,126
Fuck you.

189
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,710
You disrespectful
little bitch.

190
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,748
You just bought that one.

191
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,754
Everybody get the fuck down!

192
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,222
(ALARM RINGING)

193
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:58,657
Fuck you!

194
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,692
Get down.

195
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:03,728
(ALARM RINGING)

196
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:11,102
LT. FALTON:
Get up, Burns.

197
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:12,837
You been here, what?
Three weeks?

198
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,172
And how many fights
is that, convict?

199
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,307
'Cause honestly
I've lost count.

200
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,376
You know, at first
I thought, I dunno,

201
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,378
maybe you're trying
to prove yourself.

202
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,946
Show the natives they shouldn't
mess with you

203
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,782
and your baby face.

204
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:27,919
But now I think, maybe you're
just a guy that likes fighting.

205
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:30,155
Just trying to protect...

206
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:31,823
And who the fuck are you?

207
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,725
Chris Cesario.

208
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:34,392
I'm new.

209
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:35,894
LT. FALTON:
No shit!

210
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:38,396
You think this asshole
is protecting you?

211
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,799
You think
he's your friend?

212
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:43,134
Are you this fish's
friend, inmate?

213
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,003
No.

214
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:47,839
LT. FALTON: Are you trying to protect
him from getting his shit reamed

215
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:50,075
by this wetback
or anybody else in my yard?

216
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,743
JAMES:
No.

217
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:54,145
LT. FALTON:
Why don't you tell him, inmate?

218
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,281
I don't give
a fuck about you.

219
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:58,349
LT. FALTON: You must not care
about the ratification committee.

220
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,285
You couldn't possibly.

221
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,721
'Cause you like it here.
I like it here.

222
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:05,857
The difference is, I like it
here because this is my yard.

223
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,425
You like it here 'cause
it's an opportunity

224
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:11,162
for you to suck dick!

225
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:12,797
Once a loser...

226
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,834
always a loser.

227
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,472
CRYSTAL: Thought you said
your mom wasn't home.

228
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:23,842
Okay, then,
why are you afraid?

229
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:26,845
Look, Mary,
I thought you were cool.

230
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,383
Okay!

231
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:35,787
Nice place, Mary.

232
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,122
Oh.

233
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:39,224
Mary.
You were very cute.

234
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,126
What happened?

235
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:43,762
Just like a--
oh!

236
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,363
Was this what
you were talkin' about?

237
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:46,931
Cold?
Hot?

238
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,233
MARY: Yeah.
Yeah?

239
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:50,869
Yeah?

240
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,403

Do you get high?

272
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,503
I have an idea.

273
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,406
Which ones?

274
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:03,141
Okay, seriously, stop.

275
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:04,876
Oh my God, relax, Mary.

276
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:07,278
It's not like we're gonna steal
your mom's jewellery.

Um...
yes we are.

We are.

that thing on your ankle.

Who's Roc?

284
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,574
Manny and I
do some work for him.

00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:39,244
Making runs,
shit like that.

286
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:40,945
You mean like drugs?

Ha-ha!
Wow.

00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:45,049
What?

MANNY: When you talk
about it, it sounds boring.

Anyone in the game
on the East side

291
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,056
knows he's got
that product.

292
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,925
And he's got 'em
shook too,

293
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:56,127
'cause Roc don't
back down from nobody.

294
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,399
Fuck.

00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:37,502
Hey, James.

298
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:40,371
You know what?

299
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,373
Any time he wants...

300
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,476
your PO can come
to this house

301
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:47,145
and search
through your shit.

302
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:50,581
You think he won't haul your ass
right back into lockup?

303
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,118
So tell me, what is this?
Did you have people over?

304
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,487
Were you drinking alcohol
in my house?

305
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,027
What about school?

306
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,663
You know the judge is about
to hear your appeal.

307
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:08,533
And we are so close.

308
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:10,969
So close to what?

309
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,204
I've been stuck at home
for two months.

310
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:15,373
And they're still fighting
to keep me out.

311
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,641
They don't want me.

312
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,476
Do you know how hard
I'm working for you?

313
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,012
JAMES: You know what?
Fuck school!

314
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:24,048
I'm tired of
being a charity case.

315
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,516
I really am.

316
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:29,253
You know, I wouldn't even go
back to that fucking place now

317
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:30,989
if they begged me!

318
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,557
You smart ass,
you don't mean that.

319
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,359
I know you don't mean that.

320
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:35,626
Oh yeah?

321
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:38,429

where's Dad?

00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:40,598

mature and, you know,

trying to live up

Shower time.

332
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:38,456
Time to wash those asses.

333
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,458
Get a move on.

334
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,700

is gonna be turned off.

We're just giving them a bit
before we go in

341
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:58,636
and let them
wear each other out.

Go!

343
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:03,174

A medic!

Who brought
in the shank?

350

The kid
in critical condition

351
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:41,612
with two stab wounds...

352
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:43,314
he stole a car.

353
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:44,882
First offence.

354
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,751
Zero record of violence.

His mother comes
to visit him every week,

356
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,689
together with his
girlfriend.

357
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,926
I'm not a snitch.
So what?

358
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:56,327
Think your pals
aren't gonna talk?

359

00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:54,438
I'm going batshit.

542
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,174
I don't wanna be
friends, guppy.

543
00:32:57,176 --> 00:32:59,609
I've been down more than three
years, I ain't no fish.

544
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,684
JB...

545
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:09,152
Guillermo runnin'
his mouth, man.

546
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:12,356
Punk ass said you snuck him
in the shower.

547
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:14,524
Wants to put a knife
in your back.

548
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:21,698
So what?

549
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,067
So we should handle that.

550
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:30,007
Why does nobody test that guy?

551
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,477
'Cause that guy made it known
he didn't wanna be tested.

552
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:36,380
Motherfucker's got status
in the yard.

553
00:33:36,382 --> 00:33:39,516
Killed five people inside and
saying he's done two more since.

554
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,092
Hold!

555
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,737
Planning a vacation?

556
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:03,140
Don't talk to me.

557
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:08,745
INMATE:
Why I'm right?

558
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:11,048
'Cause poetic seizures keep me
thinking in Morse code,

559
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,616
so I write all the Tory
hallucinations

560
00:34:12,618 --> 00:34:14,217
in sign language,

561
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,086
so you can see how it sounds
when I write, all right?

562
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:18,755
I write keys and escape plans
but chain gangs,

563
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:20,724
street gangs turn into literary
genius, am I right?

564
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,526
I rewrite, everybody start,

565
00:34:22,528 --> 00:34:24,061
everyone have to write--

566
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:25,429
(WHISTLING)

567
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:27,597
Yard's over!

568
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,807
(KNOCKING)

569
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,545
Yo.

570
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:43,713
What's in Rio de "Janeerio"?

571
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:48,318
CONRAD:
Shut up.

572
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,528
Hit.

573
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,697
Hit.

574
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:13,810
INMATE 1:
Somethin' better.

575
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:16,213
INMATE 2:
Somethin' better?

576
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:42,139
(EXHALING DEEPLY)

577
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:44,307
It's pronounced
"Janeiro".

578
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,747
You've been?

579
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,916
Only in my mind.

580
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,459
JAMES:
I got this kid hurt.

581
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:03,627
There was a fight
in the showers

582
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:05,162
and he got stabbed.

583
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:06,263
So?

584
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:08,431
So, I'm gonna
do something about it.

585
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:15,605
(EXHALING DEEPLY)

586
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,507
CONRAD: Oh, starting
a yard war is a good way

587
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:20,343
to make sure you don't
go back to the real world.

588
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,448
Maybe that's what
you're scared of.

589
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,450
I'm not scared.

590
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:33,456
Oh, you think you different
than these other assholes?

591
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:34,858
News for you, kid.

592
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,227
You're not.

593
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:25,675
(LAUGHING)

594
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:30,247
Go!

595
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:32,549
Oh, shit!

596
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:36,720
(LAUGHING)

597
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:38,255
Hey.

598
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:40,957
Um, can I get two grape
cigarillos

599
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:43,360
and a pack of racks,
please?

600
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:45,962
Do you have ID?

601
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:48,365
Oh... I think I
forgot it at home.

602
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,802
Come on, we're friends
aren't we?

603
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:09,653
Just take it.

604
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:10,987
What?

605
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:12,789
I don't want
any trouble.

606
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,624
I've seen you around.

607
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:15,659
I know you deal drugs.

608
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:16,660
I'm not robbing you.

609
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:18,828
I'm paying, see?

610
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:22,732
I'm James.

611
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:24,067
Hey.

612
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:26,069
Come here.

613
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:31,041
Let's go somewhere
and fuck.

614
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:35,879
<i>♪ Uh-huh</i>

615
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:39,582
<i>♪ It's a fly little low so</i>

616
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,418

619
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:50,860
Hey yo,
slow down.

620
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:56,499
CRYSTAL:
Yo!

621
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,501
Are you deaf?

622
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:01,037
Hey, yo, slow down.

623
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:03,406
JAMES:
What, here?

624
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,710
Yo, pull the fuck over!

625
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:08,878
Pull over!

626
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:13,016
What the hell
is wrong with you?

627
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:14,617
You know with the shit
we got in the trunk?

628
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:17,854
If a cop pulled us over
we would get ten years.

629
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,422
Roc sends you
on a couple errand boy jobs

630
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:21,124
and suddenly you're
fucking invincible?

631
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:22,892
No.

632
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:25,362
Then what?

633
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:26,730
What?

634
00:39:26,732 --> 00:39:28,898
I've invincible
all along.

635
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:33,937
Ugh!

636
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:35,672
Plus, with the amount
of paper

637
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:37,474
I've been puttin'
in Roc's pocket,

638
00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:41,044
he's gonna start
taking me more seriously.

639
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:43,413
I ain't nobody's bitch,
Crystal.

640
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,151
Grimey, fuck this.

641
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:50,086
Jamesy Boy here, talkin' me
into bringing him back

642
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:53,390
to their own crib,
to plan their next move.

643
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:56,693
But once, now look,
once he's inside...

644
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:57,861
Wha'd you do, man?

645
00:39:57,863 --> 00:39:59,863
I robbed them.

646
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:02,031
Oh, shit.

647
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,433
D:
Naw, right?

648
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:05,602
Swear to God,
no jokes little brother,

649
00:40:05,604 --> 00:40:07,604
picks up one of their
own pieces, right?

650
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:08,605
D:
A'ight.

651
00:40:08,607 --> 00:40:09,839
Mm-hmm, yeah.

652
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:12,776
Stands one guy,
against four.

653
00:40:12,778 --> 00:40:16,846
Eenie, meenie, miney,
motherfuckin' Moe.

654
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:18,181
THUG 2:
Shit.

655
00:40:18,183 --> 00:40:21,718
Tells him he's collecting
a "disloyalty tax".

656
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,453
Disloyalty tax.

657
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:24,721
Hold up.

658
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:26,523
What the fuck
happened after that?

659
00:40:26,525 --> 00:40:28,925
They shit their pants,
is what happened!

660
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,894
They paid him!

661
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:32,896
They pissed
all over their rug.

662
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:34,497
And I end up making money

663
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:37,834
on what's supposed to be
a strike against me.

664
00:40:37,836 --> 00:40:40,003
Right?

665
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:45,775
But that shit
ain't even the point.

666
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,445
Naw.

667
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:51,581
The point is,
Jamesy Boy's got loyalty.

668
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,587
It was good.

669
00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:00,557
I want to talk to you about
some ideas I got.

670
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:03,026
Maybe a couple deals I think
I could line up on my own.

671
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:07,931
All right.

672
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:09,999
Drink one of these.

673
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:12,168
Put some fuckin' bass
in your voice.

674
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:21,544
(COUGHING)

675
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:23,546
Not now.

676
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:25,048
Right?

677
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,216
You keep putting in
that work

678
00:41:26,218 --> 00:41:29,018
on the smaller jobs,
we'll see.

679
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:31,955
All good?

680
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:33,690
Cool.

681
00:41:33,692 --> 00:41:37,093
All right.

682
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:40,997
By the way,
congratulations on Crystal.

683
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:44,200
Thank God
for the sluts, right?

684
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:06,556
Hon, look what I found.

685
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:08,224
What is this,
like a diary or some shit?

686
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:10,727
You writing down
your feelings?

687
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:12,662
What are you doing?

688
00:42:12,664 --> 00:42:14,163
Can you imagine if Roc
or Drew found this?

689
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:15,565
Give it back!
Oh my God.

690
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:16,733
I said give it back
to me!

691
00:42:16,735 --> 00:42:19,602
Oh! Calm down.
Hey.

692
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:21,905
I just didn't know
my big tough gangster

693
00:42:21,907 --> 00:42:24,073
had a soft
and chewy centre.

694
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:29,279
What?

695
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:31,915
Hey!

696
00:42:31,917 --> 00:42:33,716
Hey.

697
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,218
Come here.

698
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,954
I'm sorry, okay?

699
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:41,858
I promise we'll never
talk about your diary again.

700
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,060
All right?

701
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:12,922
How was your drive?

702
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,091
Long.

703
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:19,862
There was construction,
the weather's shit, of course.

704
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:23,333
How's Holly?

705
00:43:23,335 --> 00:43:24,701
Better.

706
00:43:24,703 --> 00:43:26,102
She says hi.

707
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:29,672
She looks like she might
actually...

708
00:43:29,674 --> 00:43:31,975
make good.

709
00:43:31,977 --> 00:43:33,910
I guess I probably
helped with that.

710
00:43:33,912 --> 00:43:35,745
"Now you best behave yourself
or you'll end up

711
00:43:35,747 --> 00:43:39,616
You haven't ended up
like anything yet.

712
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,220
God, I hate--

713
00:43:44,222 --> 00:43:46,389
I hate this place.

714
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:50,326
I could've been here too.

715
00:43:50,328 --> 00:43:53,096
No, you wouldn't have.

716
00:43:53,098 --> 00:43:55,264
Thanks.

717
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:00,069
What do you want
for Christmas?

718
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:01,337
What?

719
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:02,805
Your hearing's
in five weeks,

720
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,407
it's your first
Christmas in four years,

721
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:06,376
you can bet there's gonna be
something under the tree.

722
00:44:06,378 --> 00:44:08,211
When was the last time
you got a tree?

723
00:44:08,213 --> 00:44:09,879
I'm getting you
a kickass present,

724
00:44:09,881 --> 00:44:15,184
so unless you want socks,
you better say something.

725
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,156
Just a hearing, Mom.

726
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:32,268
We've both got dealt
shitty hands, boy,

727
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:34,937
but things are
gonna get better?

728
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:40,209
Yeah.

729
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,971
Yo.

730
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,499
Well?

731
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,869
Is it honest?

732
00:47:19,871 --> 00:47:21,537
Yeah.

733
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:23,906
Why the hell do you care
what I think?

734
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:37,620
You really kill
five people?

735
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:07,917
There's a giant bay...

736
00:48:07,919 --> 00:48:12,889
and in the middle
there's a rock...

737
00:48:12,891 --> 00:48:16,192
and way up high
on the mountain...

738
00:48:16,194 --> 00:48:20,129
there's a 100-foot tall
statue of Jesus Christ...

739
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:23,966
with his arms spread out.

740
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:30,673
They speak Spanish there,
right?

741
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:34,510
Naw.

742
00:48:34,512 --> 00:48:37,613
No, Portuguese.

743
00:48:37,615 --> 00:48:40,082
It's the only country
in South America

744
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:41,951
where they don't
speak Spanish.

745
00:48:41,953 --> 00:48:45,221
And they eat those,
um...

746
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:47,023
those little bananas,
right?

747
00:48:47,025 --> 00:48:49,959
Plantains.

748
00:48:49,961 --> 00:48:51,527
Hmm.

749
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:54,330
Now you keep writing.

750
00:48:54,332 --> 00:48:56,699
It don't matter about what,

751
00:48:56,701 --> 00:49:00,636
it don't even matter
if it's good or not.

752
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:03,973
You do everything you can
to just block this shit out.

753
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:08,177
Just block it out.

754
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:21,524
Prisons are packed
with crowded spaces.

755
00:49:21,526 --> 00:49:25,995
Lifers and guards,
with hollow faces.

756
00:49:34,205 --> 00:49:35,671
Amongst the sea--

757
00:49:35,673 --> 00:49:38,174
But amongst the sea
of tribulation...

758
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:45,214
<i>♪ Well, I'm waiting on a day

00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:06,068

769
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:03,259
Cesario,
get up man.

770
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:04,760
You gotta show them
you're strong,

771
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:07,163
get the fuck up, man.

772
00:51:07,165 --> 00:51:09,165
All right.

773
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,371
JAMES:
What's up with you?

774
00:51:15,373 --> 00:51:17,373
What's up, ha.

775
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:24,780
Read that.

776
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:42,531
I had a girl
on the outside too.

777
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:45,801
I was crazy for her.

778
00:51:45,803 --> 00:51:48,471
But after I went down,
she stopped talking.

779
00:51:48,473 --> 00:51:50,706
It's tough.

780
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:52,541
But it's not
the end of the world.

781
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:54,810
I guess so, ha.

782
00:51:54,812 --> 00:51:58,280
Stephanie was like the whole
reason I kept going.

783
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:00,316
Two fucking years.

784
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:05,621
So, you know, um,
when I was in the med ward,

785
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:08,424
there were these
visitors that would come in

786
00:52:08,426 --> 00:52:10,192
and read to us.

787
00:52:10,194 --> 00:52:12,428
One of them
told me something.

788
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:14,697
That we have the right
to file a formal complaint

789
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:16,198
and bypass the COs,

790
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,667
and go straight
to the administration.

791
00:52:18,669 --> 00:52:20,202
You can't do that.

792
00:52:20,204 --> 00:52:23,439
If there's an investigation,
maybe they'll--

793
00:52:23,441 --> 00:52:25,741
maybe they'll transfer
me out of here.

794
00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:27,309
Where do you
think you are?

795
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:29,845
Administration would never
side with an inmate

796
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:31,480
against the system.

797
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:34,216
Everybody looks out
for their own.

798
00:52:34,218 --> 00:52:36,252
All right.

799
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:38,621
You're close.

800
00:52:38,623 --> 00:52:41,190
Just keep
your head down.

801
00:52:41,192 --> 00:52:43,192
All right,
once you're out of here,

802
00:52:43,194 --> 00:52:45,361
you'll get a new girlfriend
with bigger tits.

803
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,763
Yeah?
You promise?

804
00:52:47,765 --> 00:52:49,665
Did your old girlfriend
have big tits?

805
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:52,201
Um, I-- no.

806
00:52:52,203 --> 00:52:54,837
I promise.

807
00:53:01,846 --> 00:53:04,213
What are
you doin' here?

808
00:53:04,215 --> 00:53:06,482
Thought Roc
was sending Drew?

809
00:53:06,484 --> 00:53:07,750
He couldn't come.

810
00:53:07,752 --> 00:53:09,919
It's just me.

811
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:36,979
Who the fuck
are you?

812
00:53:36,981 --> 00:53:39,415
We're here
to collect for Roc.

813
00:53:39,417 --> 00:53:41,383
The fuck you are.

814
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:42,585
I deals with Roc.

815
00:53:42,587 --> 00:53:44,553
Not his little
schoolboy bitches.

816
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:45,721
Come on, man.

817
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:47,256
You know
we work for Roc,

818
00:53:47,258 --> 00:53:49,325
it doesn't have to
be that way.

819
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,795
Actually, let's do it
exactly this way.

820
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,799
You wanna test us?
Fine.

821
00:53:56,801 --> 00:53:59,401
Pick it up.

822
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:01,403
Pick it up!

823
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,807
Okay, you pick it up.

824
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:06,342
James,
let's just--

825
00:54:06,344 --> 00:54:08,344
Pick it up!

826
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:14,817
Now where's the money?

827
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:17,319
FAT ASS MANAGER:
What do you see here, man?

828
00:54:17,321 --> 00:54:20,756
Is this a fucking game
of cops and robbers?

829
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:21,757
I don't have any.

830
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,926
Bullshit.

831
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:26,428
(SCREAMING)
Bullshit!

832
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,930
What's in the safe?

833
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:30,299
Shut up!
Stop screaming!

834
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:35,371
(TRAIN HORN BLARING)

835
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:50,452
What are you doing?

836
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:51,587
Yo!

837
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:53,589
What are you doing?

838
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,796
Bro, somebody's
gonna see you.

839
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:05,868
What the fuck!

840
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:08,037
You're insane!

841
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,813
Holy shit!

842
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,982
D: What?
Look at this!

843
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:24,386
How much you think
this shit's worth?

844
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:27,856
CRYSTAL:
You're an idiot.

845
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:29,825
What was I
supposed to do?

846
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:30,993
Turn around
and leave the room

847
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:32,995
with my tail
between my fucking legs?

848
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:37,333
With a gun on you?

849
00:55:37,335 --> 00:55:41,870
Yeah. That's exactly what
you're supposed to do.

850
00:55:41,872 --> 00:55:44,039
You wanna live
to be like Roc?

851
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:46,375
Then you gotta
be smart.

852
00:55:46,377 --> 00:55:48,544
Stop doing 90
with a trunk full of drugs.

853
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:54,650
I'd rather die young
than just coast through life

854
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:56,919
without ever stepping up.

855
00:55:56,921 --> 00:55:59,621
Being a man is about
taking initiative.

856
00:55:59,623 --> 00:56:00,789
A man?

857
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:02,624
You're not a man.

858
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:05,027
You're just a little boy
with a death wish.

859
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:07,830
Fuck you!
Grow up!

860
00:56:07,832 --> 00:56:09,832
What about Roc?
Is he a man?

861
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:11,734
Is that why
you fucked him?

862
00:56:11,736 --> 00:56:12,901
James.
Stop.

863
00:56:12,903 --> 00:56:14,103
What about those guys
in the club?

864
00:56:14,105 --> 00:56:16,472
Are they men too?
I said stop.

865
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:20,843
JAMES: You're just a
piece of ass to them.

866
00:56:20,845 --> 00:56:23,011
That's all you'll ever be.

867
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:31,153
Don't you fucking
walk away from me!

868
00:57:10,027 --> 00:57:12,194
Unlock the fridge!

869
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:16,665
Unlock the fucking fridge!

870
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,470
Hello?

871
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:27,042
Shit.

872
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:30,145
I'm sorry.

873
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:34,716
You have ID?

874
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:38,120
Um...

875
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:41,023
It's my dad's store.

876
00:57:41,025 --> 00:57:42,925
We live next door.

877
00:57:42,927 --> 00:57:45,160
I help out when
I'm not in school.

878
00:57:45,162 --> 00:57:46,829
I dunno if you know this,

879
00:57:46,831 --> 00:57:49,531
but there's some lunatics
running around this hood.

880
00:57:49,533 --> 00:57:53,502
Especially at
this time of night.

881
00:57:53,504 --> 00:57:54,503
He's drunk.

882
00:57:54,505 --> 00:57:55,971
So it's either
do it myself

883
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:57,940
or we lose the business
for the night.

884
00:57:57,942 --> 00:57:59,107
Fair enough.

885
00:57:59,109 --> 00:58:01,210
Anyway,
I can handle myself.

886
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,519
What happened
to your hand?

887
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:15,757
You scared of me?

888
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:18,894
I don't know.

889
00:58:18,896 --> 00:58:21,063
Maybe.

890
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:25,734
You want a cigarette?

891
00:58:25,736 --> 00:58:27,736
Maybe.

892
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:43,185
Thanks.

893
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,833
And what
are you doing?

894
00:58:57,835 --> 00:59:00,602
Magic trick.

895
00:59:00,604 --> 00:59:01,803
Yeah?
Yeah.

896
00:59:01,805 --> 00:59:02,871
'Kay...

897
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:04,840
You see?

898
00:59:04,842 --> 00:59:05,974
Full pack.

899
00:59:05,976 --> 00:59:08,110
Mm-hmm.

900
00:59:08,112 --> 00:59:10,812
But wait.

901
00:59:10,814 --> 00:59:12,681
Little shake.

902
00:59:12,683 --> 00:59:14,950
And...

903
00:59:14,952 --> 00:59:17,085
they're gone.

904
00:59:17,087 --> 00:59:19,254
But wait...

905
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:22,858
They're back.

906
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:25,327
No way!

907
00:59:25,329 --> 00:59:26,628
Way.

908
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:27,729
Oh!

909
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:29,064
I applaud you.

910
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:33,268
(CHUCKLING)

911
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:36,271
Who was that girl
you were with last week?

912
00:59:36,273 --> 00:59:37,873
Oh...

913
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:40,776
that is, um,
Crystal.

914
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:44,713
She's all right.

915
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:16,011
ROC:
What the fuck did you do?

916
01:00:16,013 --> 01:00:18,113
JAMES:
Roc.

917
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:20,182
Calm down, bro.

918
01:00:20,184 --> 01:00:22,751
This guy was trying
to screw you over.

919
01:00:22,753 --> 01:00:24,920
I was just showing
a little initiative.

920
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:28,023
A little initiative?

921
01:00:28,025 --> 01:00:29,324
Yeah.

922
01:00:29,326 --> 01:00:32,327
I'm doing this shit
for you, man.

923
01:00:32,329 --> 01:00:35,197
Oh.

924
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,865
Thank God.

925
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:39,267
'Cause, see,
that's not what I thought.

926
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:44,740
I thought you got
your pride wounded.

927
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:50,078
And that you stupidly,
without thinking about it,

928
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:53,715
burned one of
my contacts.

929
01:00:53,717 --> 01:00:55,817
My business partners.

930
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:57,653
Just to make yourself
feel better.

931
01:00:57,655 --> 01:00:58,820
That's not how it is--

932
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:00,022
Shut the fuck up!

933
01:01:00,024 --> 01:01:02,324
It's not how it--
Shut up!

934
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:04,259
That's not all!

935
01:01:04,261 --> 01:01:09,064
I also thought you stole
a huge fucking bag of guns

936
01:01:09,066 --> 01:01:11,233
and brought
it back to my house!

937
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:15,937
I oughta fill you
with fucking lead.

938
01:01:15,939 --> 01:01:17,339
James...

939
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:22,711
(HEAVY BREATHING)

940
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:28,717
(HEAVY BREATHING)

941
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:34,723
(HEAVY BREATHING)

942
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:39,361
Then, James,
I thought no.

943
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:43,799
No.

944
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:46,968
Jamesy Boy wouldn't do that.

945
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:50,205
Jamesy Boy's smart.

946
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:53,075
Jamesy Boy would know

947
01:01:53,077 --> 01:01:56,178
that guns
are a shit business.

948
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:58,880
'Cause if we sell them
on the street...

949
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:01,850
any punk bitch
who gets busted with one

950
01:02:01,852 --> 01:02:05,053
just to get a couple years
knocked off their time!

951
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:11,393
Fuckin' James.

952
01:02:11,395 --> 01:02:14,930
That is my money
in that bag.

953
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:22,237
You and D are gonna
figure out

954
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,172
a way to fix this.

955
01:02:24,174 --> 01:02:27,042
You feel me?

956
01:02:27,044 --> 01:02:28,477
Yeah.

957
01:02:28,479 --> 01:02:30,011
Hmm?

958
01:02:30,013 --> 01:02:32,013
Yeah.

959
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:39,888
(KNOCKING)

960
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:43,792
Come in.

961
01:02:43,794 --> 01:02:46,128
PRISON GUARD:
Sorry to bother you, sir.

962
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:48,296
This is with
the medical kites.

963
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,442
Put him in room four.

964
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:02,811
PRISON GUARD:
Sir.

965
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:11,486
Must be important...

966
01:03:11,488 --> 01:03:13,855
if you wanna talk to me.

967
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,459
Take Cesario off the yard
until his hearing.

968
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:21,296
Put him in PC.

969
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:22,964
He's too weak.

970
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:24,466
You don't get into
a fight for a week,

971
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:25,967
I'm supposed to think
you grew a heart.

972
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:28,270
Somebody's gonna
hurt him? Great.

973
01:03:28,272 --> 01:03:30,438
Gimme a name.

974
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:33,842
This is an inmate
who was involved

975
01:03:33,844 --> 01:03:36,444
in a near fatal knife fight
in my shower room.

976
01:03:36,446 --> 01:03:37,879
That's bullshit--

977
01:03:37,881 --> 01:03:39,447
No, but I don't know
that because, see,

978
01:03:39,449 --> 01:03:40,849
you didn't make a statement
at the time, did you?

979
01:03:40,851 --> 01:03:42,117
So you're gonna let
the kid die

980
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:43,251
to teach me
a fucking lesson?

981
01:03:43,253 --> 01:03:44,519
Hey, watch your tone,
convict.

982
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:46,388
Remember who
you're talking to.

983
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:48,857
There are 30,000 people
incarcerated in this state

984
01:03:48,859 --> 01:03:51,326
right at this very minute,
you know how many work here?

985
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:52,994
3,000.
Total.

986
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:55,997
My COs come to work
ten hours a day

987
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:58,433
completely surrounded
by assholes like you

988
01:03:58,435 --> 01:04:02,003
who spend 24 trying out
how to murder him.

989
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:04,272
Big badge of honour to take down
a corrections officer,

990
01:04:04,274 --> 01:04:05,273
ain't that right?

991
01:04:05,275 --> 01:04:06,875
No, for Chris--

992
01:04:06,877 --> 01:04:09,110
If I can't afford to make
the distinction...

993
01:04:09,112 --> 01:04:11,913
you think I'm an asshole
because it's fun?

994
01:04:11,915 --> 01:04:14,583
I do it...

995
01:04:14,585 --> 01:04:16,952
because that's how
my guys survive.

996
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:22,424
I'm taking a real risk sitting
down with you right now.

997
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:28,496
I'm asking you.

998
01:04:28,498 --> 01:04:30,866
Person to person.

999
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:38,506
There's nothing
I can do.

1000
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:45,180
Hey, yo, white boy...

1001
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:53,355
GUILLERMO: Heard you
been talking to Falton.

1002
01:04:53,357 --> 01:04:56,992
You mention me,
or any one of my soldagos...

1003
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:02,530
I'll make sure you get
your throat cut.

1004
01:05:02,532 --> 01:05:04,666
Hey, controllate.

1005
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:07,602
It ain't my fault your
little bitch ass boyfriend

1006
01:05:07,604 --> 01:05:09,237
keeps on falling
down stairs.

1007
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:11,673
You're gonna fuck up
his release, you know that?

1008
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:16,544
GUILLERMO:
Do something.

1009
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:20,582
You ain't got no heart.

1010
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:22,417
Do something,
white boy.

1011
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:24,519
Come on.
Hit me.

1012
01:05:24,521 --> 01:05:27,489
I wanna see them
revoke your ass.

1013
01:05:27,491 --> 01:05:29,491
Right here.

1014
01:05:29,493 --> 01:05:30,992
Free shot,
white boy.

1015
01:05:30,994 --> 01:05:34,062
Take your shot,
right here.

1016
01:05:34,064 --> 01:05:36,231
INMATE: Yo, wreck that
motherfucker, JB.

1017
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:42,337
Do something!

1018
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,694
JAMES:
Excuse me.

1019
01:06:40,629 --> 01:06:42,230
SARAH'S FATHER:
Can I help you?

1020
01:06:42,232 --> 01:06:44,566
Uh, yeah.

1021
01:06:44,568 --> 01:06:47,135
Is Sarah around?

1022
01:06:47,137 --> 01:06:49,371
Do you know what damn time
it is?

1023
01:06:49,373 --> 01:06:51,506
Dad, it's okay.

1024
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:54,743
I used to take walks
like this with my mom.

1025
01:06:54,745 --> 01:06:56,244
Yeah?

1026
01:06:56,246 --> 01:07:00,315
Before she got sick.

1027
01:07:00,317 --> 01:07:04,052
The spine, yeah.
She got better.

1028
01:07:04,054 --> 01:07:07,655
But she hasn't been
the same since.

1029
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:12,193
I think for a while there she
thought she was gonna die

1030
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:17,298
and she was disappointed
that the world didn't stop.

1031
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,300
My dad still had the store,

1032
01:07:19,302 --> 01:07:21,369
I still went to school.

1033
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:23,538
I made her angry.

1034
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,774
Man, you don't hold back,
do you.

1035
01:07:25,776 --> 01:07:29,444
I can stop if you want.

1036
01:07:29,446 --> 01:07:31,613
No, I didn't mean it
like that.

1037
01:07:35,651 --> 01:07:38,253
I've been institutionalized
since I was six.

1038
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:43,091
What did you do when
you were six?

1039
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,561
I was an angry kid.

1040
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:49,297
I used to get into fights,
break things,

1041
01:07:49,299 --> 01:07:52,267
shit like that.

1042
01:07:52,269 --> 01:07:56,404
My whole life I've never been
to a regular school.

1043
01:07:56,406 --> 01:07:59,340
And as far
as I can remember,

1044
01:07:59,342 --> 01:08:01,776
every room
I walked into...

1045
01:08:01,778 --> 01:08:04,312
they already knew
I was a lost cause.

1046
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:08,416
All I want...

1047
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:10,585
is a normal life.

1048
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:14,589
What if a man came
from the future

1049
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:17,125
and said you'd have
a happy life?

1050
01:08:17,127 --> 01:08:19,494
What if he showed you your
future wife and your children

1051
01:08:19,496 --> 01:08:21,663
and you're all totally happy?

1052
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:26,701
Would you be scared?

1053
01:08:26,703 --> 01:08:28,470
I don't know.

1054
01:08:28,472 --> 01:08:30,405
Not that it matters.

1055
01:08:30,407 --> 01:08:33,208
I'm not the kind of girl
that rises above all this.

1056
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:38,446
I'm not so pretty and I
don't do that well in school.

1057
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:42,550
Nobody's coming from the future
to tell us anything.

1058
01:08:42,552 --> 01:08:44,719
JAMES:
Maybe that's true.

1059
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,524
But...

1060
01:08:49,526 --> 01:08:51,426
you are pretty.

1084
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:00,755
Any news?

1085
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:02,757
Oh yeah.

1086
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:04,926
Cesario got revocated.

1087
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,429
Six years.

1088
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:10,365
Heh...

1089
01:11:10,367 --> 01:11:12,367
What's the matter,
Burns?

1090
01:11:12,369 --> 01:11:14,369
You look sad.

1091
01:11:52,742 --> 01:11:54,342
ROBYN:
Who is that?

1092
01:11:54,344 --> 01:11:55,610
Hey!

1093
01:11:55,612 --> 01:11:57,745
That's James.

1094
01:11:57,747 --> 01:11:59,447
My friends, Robyn.

1095
01:11:59,449 --> 01:12:01,015
Hey, what's up?

1096
01:12:01,017 --> 01:12:02,717
You got to school here?

1097
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:04,452
Uh, James goes to Roosevelt.

1098
01:12:04,454 --> 01:12:05,620
Wanna play some ball?

1099
01:12:05,622 --> 01:12:07,989
We need another person.

1100
01:12:07,991 --> 01:12:08,990
Sure.

1101
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:11,626
All right.
James is on my team.

1102
01:12:11,628 --> 01:12:14,696
Cool.

1103
01:12:14,698 --> 01:12:16,864
BOY:
Ball, ball, ball!

1104
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:21,803
BOY:
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1105
01:12:21,805 --> 01:12:23,838
Woo!

1106
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,040
BOY:
Get your man!

1107
01:12:26,042 --> 01:12:28,042
Ah!

1108
01:12:33,382 --> 01:12:35,383
James!

1109
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:39,520
Woo!

1110
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:41,556
BOY:
Did you see that?

1111
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:44,659
I didn't know
you could play ball.

1112
01:12:44,661 --> 01:12:46,094
Yeah.

1113
01:12:46,096 --> 01:12:49,497
One of many skills I learned
courtesy of the state.

1114
01:12:49,499 --> 01:12:51,432
BOY: Yo, James.
Hurry up man.

1115
01:12:51,434 --> 01:12:53,468
Yo!

1116
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:57,872
Ew,
you're all sweating.

1117
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:07,382
'Kay,
I'm gonna go play.

1118
01:13:07,384 --> 01:13:09,384
All right.

1119
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,571
(SCREAMING)

1120
01:13:47,457 --> 01:13:49,624
What are you always
writing about?

1121
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:54,529
Nothing.

1122
01:13:57,132 --> 01:13:58,499
I'm gonna take you away

1123
01:13:58,501 --> 01:14:00,535
from this shithole
neighbourhood.

1124
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,208
That sounds nice.

1125
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:12,680
Things are
gonna be different.

1126
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:15,750
We're gonna be different.

1127
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:35,703
Good.

1128
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:57,525
Look who decided to visit.

1129
01:14:57,527 --> 01:14:59,827
You know, it's like
you're never here anymore.

1130
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:00,995
I'm leaving.

1131
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:03,164
The fuck you are.

1132
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:06,601
This isn't a good place,
Crystal.

1133
01:15:06,603 --> 01:15:08,169
It's a dead end.

1134
01:15:08,171 --> 01:15:09,670
You should get out too.

1135
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:10,838
With who?

1136
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,106
With you?

1137
01:15:12,108 --> 01:15:14,275
Do you love me?

1138
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:17,278
No. You don't.

1139
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:20,014
You'd rather fuck that ugly
bitch from the store, right?

1140
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:21,115
Don't talk about her
like that.

1141
01:15:21,117 --> 01:15:22,850
Where you been
that past two weeks?

1142
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:24,285
Huh?

1143
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:27,688
You been sleeping
at her house?

1144
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:28,890
You're stupid.

1145
01:15:28,892 --> 01:15:30,825
You pathetic
little boy.

1146
01:15:30,827 --> 01:15:33,160
And you're never gonna find
another woman like me.

1147
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:37,832
You wanna what
me and Roc did last night?

1148
01:15:55,617 --> 01:15:57,652
ROC:
Yo!

1149
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:02,256
Where you going?

1150
01:16:02,258 --> 01:16:05,126
D:
I got the call this morning.

1151
01:16:05,128 --> 01:16:06,861
Chuck found the body.

1152
01:16:06,863 --> 01:16:08,863
The deal's tonight.

1153
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:15,303
What happened
to loyalty, James?

1154
01:16:15,305 --> 01:16:18,739
What happened to riding
'till the wheels fall off?

1155
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:21,042
Yo.

1156
01:16:21,044 --> 01:16:22,710
I'm the guy
who took you in

1157
01:16:22,712 --> 01:16:25,079
off the street
and gave you your shot.

1158
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:28,082
I don't owe you anything,
Roc.

1159
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:30,184
Okay.

1160
01:16:30,186 --> 01:16:33,888
Let me paint you a picture,
Jamesy Boy.

1161
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:35,890
One year from now,

1162
01:16:35,892 --> 01:16:37,725
and we kicking it at the club,

1163
01:16:37,727 --> 01:16:40,928
doing better than ever,
wearing rollies.

1164
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:43,164
Reminiscing.

1165
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:45,766
You know what
we're talking about?

1166
01:16:45,768 --> 01:16:49,604
We talkin' about James,
the pussy.

1167
01:16:49,606 --> 01:16:52,607
James,
who was less than a man,

1168
01:16:52,609 --> 01:16:55,209
and turned his back
on his brothers.

1169
01:16:55,211 --> 01:16:57,378
You walk down that street...

1170
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:01,649
Yo...

1171
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:04,652
That's your legacy, kid.

1172
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:16,030
All right,
just tonight.

1173
01:17:16,032 --> 01:17:17,231
See, D?

1174
01:17:17,233 --> 01:17:18,899
I told you we could
count on him.

1175
01:17:18,901 --> 01:17:20,801
Jamesy Boy's the man.

1176
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:23,104
(CLANGING)

1177
01:17:23,106 --> 01:17:25,206
PRISON GUARD 1:
You know the drills, ladies.

1178
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:26,374
On the line.

1179
01:17:26,376 --> 01:17:29,076
Have those ID badges out.

1180
01:17:29,078 --> 01:17:31,345
Here we go.

1181
01:17:31,347 --> 01:17:33,180
Move it in, mate,
let's go.

1182
01:17:33,182 --> 01:17:34,281
On the line.

1183
01:17:34,283 --> 01:17:35,683
PRISON GUARD 2:
Line 'em up!

1184
01:17:35,685 --> 01:17:36,917
PRISON GUARD 1:
Let me see that badge.

1185
01:17:36,919 --> 01:17:38,953
PRISON GUARD 2: Fall in.
Let's go.

1186
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:51,899
PRISON GUARD 3:
Hold!

1187
01:17:51,901 --> 01:17:53,901
PRISON GUARD 1:
Hold up.

1188
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:01,909
Check him out!
Check him out.

1189
01:18:01,911 --> 01:18:03,110
Check him--
oh, hey, yo.

1190
01:18:03,112 --> 01:18:05,312
Hey, yo!

1191
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:09,116
(YELLING)

1192
01:18:09,118 --> 01:18:10,418
You little whore,
you better jump,

1193
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:11,952
'cause I'm gonna
make you wish you had.

1194
01:18:11,954 --> 01:18:13,287
Don't come any closer.

1195
01:18:13,289 --> 01:18:16,257
Officer, stand down!

1196
01:18:16,259 --> 01:18:19,260
Cesario, do not do this
on my watch!

1197
01:18:19,262 --> 01:18:20,995
You hear me boy?

1198
01:18:20,997 --> 01:18:22,196
JAMES:
Chris.

1199
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:23,197
Chris!

1200
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,099
We can talk about this, son.

1201
01:18:25,101 --> 01:18:27,301
LT. FALTON: Come to the office,
we'll straighten this out.

1202
01:18:27,303 --> 01:18:28,302
Do it!
Come on!

1203
01:18:28,304 --> 01:18:29,837
He's doing it!

1204
01:18:29,839 --> 01:18:32,973
Think about what you're
fucking doing right now!

1205
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:17,251
JAMES:
No!

1206
01:19:29,865 --> 01:19:31,265
Cut him down.

1207
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:32,433
Get him up.

1208
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:33,868
PRISON GUARD 4:
Sir.

1209
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:35,035
LT. FALTON:
Get to your feet, inmate.

1210
01:19:35,037 --> 01:19:37,805
Get up!

1211
01:19:37,807 --> 01:19:38,939
This is over.

1212
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:41,475
You understand me?

1213
01:19:41,477 --> 01:19:43,277
Look at me!
This is over!

1214
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:45,913
It did not
have to happen.

1215
01:19:45,915 --> 01:19:47,381
Lock it down.

1216
01:19:47,383 --> 01:19:48,816
Lock it down!

1217
01:19:48,818 --> 01:19:51,085
PRISON GUARD 1:
Move the fuck back!

1218
01:19:51,087 --> 01:19:53,187
The fuck-- no!

1219
01:19:53,189 --> 01:19:55,356

Calm the fuck down!
Calm fuckin' down!

01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:09,103
Stop!
Right now!

1223
01:20:09,105 --> 01:20:10,304
Let him go.
He hit you!

1224
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:12,473
That is an order!

1225
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:17,945
Put him back in his cell.

1226
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,488
Check that.

1227
01:20:28,423 --> 01:20:30,057
Put him in the hole.

1228
01:20:30,059 --> 01:20:32,326
Lock it down.

1229
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:34,495
LT. FALTON:
Lock it down!

1230
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:55,983
JAMES:
Yo, something's up, bro.

1231
01:20:55,985 --> 01:20:57,184
No, it's not.

1232
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:59,353
Be easy.

1233
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:04,458
Text him again.

1234
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:11,498

01:30:56,017 --> 01:30:58,185
Not too long ago...

1406
01:31:02,056 --> 01:31:04,224
I saw an inmate kill himself.

1407
01:31:09,063 --> 01:31:11,231
He was my friend.

1408
01:31:14,502 --> 01:31:16,703
But I wasn't his,
you know?

1409
01:31:19,774 --> 01:31:22,108
And maybe I could've helped,
I don't know.

1410
01:31:25,046 --> 01:31:27,781
But I'm gonna have to live with
that for the rest of my life.

1411
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:33,487
And I don't think I've let
the people in my life down

1412

by making
the wrong choices.

1413
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:39,793

by convincing myself...

1414
01:31:40,962 --> 01:31:43,129

to begin with.

1415

to sit at a table

1416

and tell me...

1417
01:31:50,138 --> 01:31:53,840
I deserve to be
an outcast.

1418
01:31:53,842 --> 01:31:56,009
And maybe you're not the last.

1419
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:00,547
But for the rest of my life...

1420
01:32:02,216 --> 01:32:05,685
people will look at me
and know I was here.

1421
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:11,558
They'll question
my integrity...

1422
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:15,228
and say I'm a monster.

1423
01:32:18,599 --> 01:32:21,768
But this...

1424
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:24,571
right here...

1425
01:32:24,573 --> 01:32:26,606
it's different.

1426
01:32:28,576 --> 01:32:32,946
It's different because
for the first time in my life...

1427
01:32:32,948 --> 01:32:35,115
I don't believe you.

1428
01:32:37,051 --> 01:32:40,587
Everything you've got
written there...

1429
01:32:40,589 --> 01:32:43,256
I did it.

1430
01:32:43,258 --> 01:32:45,659
And most of it I regret.

1431
01:32:48,996 --> 01:32:51,164
But...

1432

is where he will remain.

and hopelessly
blind.

time can limit
but not shatter my will,

1583
01:42:33,481 --> 01:42:35,148
strength blazed across my chest

1584
01:42:35,150 --> 01:42:37,817
as solid as
penitentiary steel.

1585
01:42:37,819 --> 01:42:39,785
But the silence speaks,

1586
01:42:39,787 --> 01:42:42,421
it tells me all I need to hear,

1587
01:42:42,423 --> 01:42:46,859
it confirms my beliefs and its
promises I have to fear.

1588
01:42:46,861 --> 01:42:51,297
It reminds me that without
freedom, I'm alone.

1589
01:42:51,299 --> 01:42:54,600
And these whitewashed walls
don't make up

1591
01:42:57,639 --> 01:43:02,308

1594
01:43:07,649 --> 01:43:12,351
What I've done is who I am,
but who I am is what I do now.

1595
01:43:12,353 --> 01:43:14,353
I won't let up or cease
to fight.

1596
01:43:14,355 --> 01:43:18,658
Just time,
I plan on doing it right.

1597
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:22,828
And what's right
lies within me.

1598
01:43:22,830 --> 01:43:26,199
I'm learning to
appreciate my struggle

1599
01:43:26,201 --> 01:43:27,733

without it.
