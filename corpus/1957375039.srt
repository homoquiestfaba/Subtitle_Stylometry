Oh, you got it. Okay, that's what's...

24
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,040
You make yourself look ugly when you fight.

25
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,640
You gotta go all the way to um...

26
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,760
Atlantic Ave. Alright?

27
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,760
Why is there one part

28
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,120
a lot of talking...

29
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,320
- You know?
- What?

30
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,960
The part on the boombox.

31
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,640
Oh, you got to press the second button. That's for recording.

32
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,680
You see? It says "record."

33
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,360
- Okay.
- Don't ever press that.

34
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,160
You probably recorded all the good music.

35
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,760
No, I didn't.

36
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,000
I haven't pressed none of those buttons.

37
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,240
Keep turn it on.

38
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,240
You can't do nothing with it off, right?

39
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,600
You can't record nothing if it's off.

40
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,680
<i>Stand clear of the closing doors.</i>

41
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,560
<i>I don't do it all the time</i>

42
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,360
<i>because it makes you dumb. Right?</i>

43
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,000
<i>You can not be a photographer and smoke crack cocaine.</i>

44
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,600
<i>You have to have money.</i>

45
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,960
<i>You have to have value.</i>

46
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,120
<i>You have to have skills.</i>

47
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,600
<i>You have to have vision, substance.</i>

48
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,320
<i>She seems like an eccentric person.</i>

49
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,120
<i>She is.</i>

50
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,560
<i>So that's why you hate her. Not...</i>

51
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,440
<i>It's different.</i>

52
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,680
<i>- Well, once you see her you're gonna not like her.
- Yeah?</i>

53
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,440
<i>... one night, and she's like, "What's that? I don't like it."</i>

54
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,480
<i>But at least she doesn't like it.</i>

55
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,480
Um, I know that it was near

56
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,720
I think it was near...

57
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,840
Yeah.

58
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,120
It was cool.

59
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,720
<i>I'm not worried, but there's always the possibility that...</i>

60
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,840
<i>23rd Street.</i>

61
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,320
<i>... racist, and segregation.</i>

62
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,480
<i>So my parents, they didn't want to poison my mind at the time.</i>

63
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,440
<i>They said, "Son, if you live long enough"</i>

64
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,800
<i>"you'll figure it out for yourself."</i>

65
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,560
<i>Okay, I took that.</i>

66
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,960
<i>I accepted that that was the answer my parents gave me.</i>

67
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,560
<i>But it still didn't explain why</i>

68
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,920
<i>I saw black people getting dogs sicced on 'em.</i>

69
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,800
<i>Why I saw firemen spraying on 'em with water hoses.</i>

70
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,040
<i>Why I saw them not drinking...</i>

71
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>They couldn't drink from the same water fountain.</i>

72
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,640
<i>We so messed up.</i>

73
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,160
<i>You got the Israelites telling black people</i>

74
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,160
<i>they ain't African.</i>

75
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,240
<i>We so messed up.</i>

76
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,440
<i>We so messed up.</i>

77
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,680
