00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,480
it's been over a year 
since the last time we spoke.

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,160
the life right out of you,
don't it? [laughs]

180
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,840
Long time
since you've been home?

181
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,880
Yes.

182
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,720
[man] You ain't kin
to Charlie Newman, are you?

183
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,200
You favor him?

184
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,440
No. Belle Delongpre?

185
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,120
Belle Delongpre?
You the model?

186
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,880
Ha! [laughs]

187
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,840
You know my daughter
gets all them magazines. Hmm.

188
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,960
Well, then you must be
April's little sister.

189
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,080
[Savannah] Yes.

190
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,440
You like New York?

191
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,560
I've been lucky there.

192
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,320
[country music playing]

193
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,680
[indistinct chatter]

194
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,240
[chimes]

195
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,240
Well, now, look at here.
Savannah Delongpre.

196
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,600
Lord, have you have grown.

197
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,320
Mr. Bowman,
you haven't changed a bit.

198
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,760
How are you?

199
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,400
Well, now, tobacco don't hold
the same glory it used to.

200
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,000
-And Mrs. Bowman?
-Mrs. Bowman?

201
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,120
She don't hold the same glory,
either.

202
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,200
So, did it get here in time?

203
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,760
Oh?
Special ordered it.

204
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,240
I special ordered it.

205
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,800
Oh, wonderful.
And the engraving?

206
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,920
Came out perfect.

207
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,320
Oh, thank you.
She's going to love this.

208
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,560
I'm gonna take
some flowers, too.

209
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,800
-How much?
-No. Flowers for a flower.

210
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,440
You probably don't remember me.

211
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,920
Henry Walker.
I was a friend of your Momma's.

212
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,840
Oh?
Nice to meet you.

213
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,680
Well, Mr. Bowman,
thank you so much.

214
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,200
Now don't you be
a stranger here, you here?

215
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
I won't.

216
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,760
She turned out the spitting
image of her mom.

217
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,960
Hard to believe,
her being so plain.

218
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,080
[country music playing]

219
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,280
[horse snorts]

220
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,200
[man] Y'all take care.

221
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,640
-[Savannah] Good-bye.
-[man] Bye now.

222
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
[country music playing]

223
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,640
Mom's car.

224
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,560
I don't know why
I keep that old thing around.

225
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,520
It took a week to get it out
and running.

226
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,000
Nana Belle!

227
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,800
Um, these are for you.

228
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,640
Store bought flowers

229
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,120
are a waste
of your good money, Savannah.

230
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,640
And what's that you're wearing?

231
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,360
Where's your luggage?

232
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,920
Oh, they lost it.

233
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,680
Well, then, I guess that means
you'll have to get some things

234
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,640
out of the back room.

235
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,840
Come on in.

236
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,560
You know where everything is.

237
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,400
Dinner's at 8:00 sharp.

238
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,680
I don't like it cold.

239
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,440
[dramatic music playing]

240
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,600
[clock ticking]

241
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,520
Bean!

242
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,280
It's so good to see you.

243
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,280
Let me look at you.

244
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,120
Oh, ain't you something.

245
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,160
Oh.

246
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,360
So glad you're here.

247
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,800
Let's go up.

248
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,080
Get comfortable,

249
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,720
relax, and I'll make us
something cool to drink.

250
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,440
How about a nice cold glass
of fresh lemonade?

251
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,320
[gasps]

252
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,520
[dramatic music playing]

253
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,800
You are a sight for sore eyes.

254
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,400
Come over here and talk to me.
I have so much to tell you.

255
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,800
What about Mr. Lee?

256
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,480
Is he treating you right, Bean?

257
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,400
Oh, Ruth, I don't know
about anything anymore.

258
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,760
Are you all right?

259
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,560
I'm just glad to be here.

260
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,120
[dramatic music playing]

261
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,680
[bell dinging]

262
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,080
All right.

263
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,720
[Belle laughs]

264
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,960
Savannah,

265
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,000
if you parade around
in those old things,

266
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,880
people are gonna say
that the Delongpres

267
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,440
can't afford a decent standard
of living.

268
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,720
Well, this would cost
a fortune in New York.

269
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,720
Well, that's the silliest thing
I ever heard.

270
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,200
Oh, no thank you, Ruth.
Maybe just some salad.

271
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,480
[Belle]
No wonder you never fill out.

272
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,400
You're always gonna be scrawny
if you don't eat something

273
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,360
that sticks to your bones.

274
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,760
I just don't know.

275
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
Thank you.

276
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,760
Thank you, Ruth.

277
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,240
[Belle] I thought maybe
you'd bring Mr. Lee home

278
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,040
with you this time, so I could
have a proper introduction.

279
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,440
I'm not seeing Robert anymore.

280
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,600
Savannah, if you're not careful,
you're never gonna settle.

281
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,480
Then what will you do?

282
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,600
I have a career, Nana.

283
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,640
You change clothes for a living.

284
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,040
You know,
I was thinking about going

285
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,160
to the summer place tomorrow.

286
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,200
Well, I rented it.

287
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,800
Until I sell it.

288
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,120
You-- You're selling Two Moon?

289
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,640
I'll have my brandy
on the veranda, Ruth.

290
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
Please.

291
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,040
[crickets chirping]

292
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,480
Why are you selling it?

293
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,800
That place has been nothing
but trouble.

294
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,640
But, Nana, she didn't--

295
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,000
It was the current,
not Two Moon.

296
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,280
I just wish you'd told me.

297
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,120
The stars are bright tonight.

298
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,600
[phone ringing]

299
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,920
Oh, Ruth, I'll get it.

300
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,160
Thank you, Ruth.

301
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,320
[phone beeps]

302
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,000
-Hello?
-[Robert] Savannah.

303
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,400
Savannah, don't hang up.

304
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,400
I want to apologize.

305
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,320
I missed you.

306
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,320
Robert don't.

307
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,840
[Robert] I'm sorry.
I was stupid.

308
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,440
I don't know
what I was thinking.

309
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,880
I just--
I just want you to come back.

310
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,160
For Saint Thomas?

311
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,560
[Robert] No, for us.

312
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,200
Savannah?

313
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,280
Robert, I'm not sure
there is an us anymore.

314
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,120
When will you be back?

315
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,320
I don't know. It's late.
I got to go.

316
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,800
[phone beeps]

317
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,680
[projector whirring]

318
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,200
Savannah, it's late.

319
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,240
Nana Belle, come watch with me.

320
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,560
No.
It's too late for me.

321
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,040
Don't stay up too long.

322
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,720
Tracy's coming by tomorrow

323
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,480
to go over the plans
for the party.

324
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,600
[dramatic music playing]

325
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,000
Hi.

326
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,000
Hi, Mommy.

327
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,040
[man] Oh, nice. Nice shot.

328
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,160
No mercy, huh?

329
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,760
Come on,
let's play one more time.

330
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,480
-No. Let's get a drink.
-Come on.

331
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,720
-Gosh.
-Oh! Oh, man!

332
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,120
You know,
I think I could beat you

333
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,520
if you didn't look so good.

334
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,120
Bert?

335
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,960
So, who else was there?

336
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,480
Uh, Remember Vaughn Woodman?

337
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,000
In our Biology class.

338
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,880
Hey, Bert, honey,
playing so hard

339
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,800
-might give you a stroke.
-Oh, that's good.

340
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,360
-You're really mean, aren't you?
-Yes, I am.

341
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,280
Mm. Hey, Junior.

342
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,120
You girls have fun, all right?

343
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,240
-I got to run.
-Bye.

344
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,480
-Bye-bye.
-So, Vaughn?

345
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,000
-Oh, Vau-- Vaughn!
-The one with the, uh,

346
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,560
with the real long hair, right?

347
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,040
-All right.
-Always so damn proud of it?

348
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,520
-Right.
-Completely bald.

349
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,920
No?

350
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,840
Oh, he looks so pathetic.

351
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,040
-Oh, gosh.
-So, you two are happy?

352
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,160
Oh, yeah.
Of course, we are.

353
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,920
So, let's see here now,
we've got the--

354
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,000
we got the wine.
We got the hors d'oeuvres.

355
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,360
The music? There is
a string quartet I use a lot.

356
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,720
Oh, you know what?

357
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,360
I don't think she's gonna want
to go for some big fuss.

358
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,880
-You know how she is?
-Oh, sure. Sure.

359
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,440
My whole damn life.
Boy this heat is getting to me.

360
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,800
You know what?
I don't miss it.

361
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,480
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

362
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,960
Oh, my gosh!
The baby just kicked.

363
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,920
-What? Oh, oh, okay.
-Put your hand and feel that.

364
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,360
Oh! You got a future linebacker
in there.

365
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,880
Now, see, if he's a boy,
we're gonna make him a junior

366
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,400
-'cause Bert likes that.
-Bert junior.

367
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,720
Foyer's full of roses
from Mr. Lee.

368
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,800
-Oh, you're kidding?
-Hmm.

369
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,480
Oh, aren't you just Miss Lucky.

370
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,520
See, now, McDonalds is about
as romantic as Bert gets.

371
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,600
Oh. Do you mind if we finish
this up tomorrow? I--

372
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,880
Oh, no. No. Besides.
my feet are real swollen--

373
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,000
-Okay.
---and junior, here,

374
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,360
she's getting restless.

375
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,600
Oh, Here. Let me help.
Let me help. Okay.

376
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,440
Are you leaving?

377
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,920
Oh, just for a little bit.

378
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,880
I hope you're not
going out there.

379
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,360
I'm a big girl, Nana.

380
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,760
So was your mother.

381
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,800
I'll be fine.

382
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,560

[dramatic music playing]

388
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,800
Savannah?

389
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,720
[water pattering]

390
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,440
Slothfulness is not a virtue,
Savannah.

391
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,120
Did you know the foyer

392
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,520
-is full of roses?
-I know.

393
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,960
I wish he'd leave me alone.

394
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,040
Well, you know
the proper thing to do

395
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,560
is just call him and thank him.

396
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,040
I'm not ready
to talk to him yet.

397
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,120
Every blossom fades, Savannah.

398
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,800
Don't think you won't.

399
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,760
[dramatic music playing]

400
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,520
[Savannah whistling]

401
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,240
Henry Walker is here
and you're going with him

402
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,240
to the charity event
instead of your grandma.

403
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,720
What?
What are you...

404
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,280
Her leg is acting up again.

405
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,200
Well, tell me,
how's your cousin Freddie?

406
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,800
-He's doing better.
-I don't believe it.

407
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,800
Nana, could I speak to you
for a moment, please?

408
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,040
Savannah, get dressed.

409
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,480
You'll keep
the Dawson's waiting.

410
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,920
I'm sorry. I thought...

411
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,640
Well, you knew Henry'd be here.

412
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,960
Hurry up.

413
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,600
I'll be just a minute.

414
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,840
Take your time.

415
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,840
She's lovely.

416
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,200
[Henry] [indistinct] race.

417
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,040
Whoa! [laughing]

418
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,520
We made the first heat.

419
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,240
Great.

420
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,480
Oh, I'm sorry.
You must be bored.

421
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,000
I doubt you play much croquette
in New York.

422
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,560
[Savannah] No grass.

423
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,640
You know, I know you're here
because of your grandmother.

424
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,360
Well, she does have a way
of getting her way.

425
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,000
Oh, don't I know it.

426
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,840
You know, it took all my powers
of persuasion to get her

427
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,280
to rent out Two Moon
after having it on the market

428
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,960
for a good year.

429
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,840
-That long?
-Yes, sir.

430
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,760
So, it wouldn't be
just standing still

431
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,600
eating up property tax.

432
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,280
Mm.

433
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,600
You know,
it's just too out of the way.

434
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,440
Oh.
Too big to heat.

435
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,920
You know, people want efficiency
these days, not charm.

436
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,400
Who's renting it?

437
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,560
[Henry] Salvage company.

438
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,920
Probably for storage.

439
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,800
They want to lease to buy.

440
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,160
Finally get it out of my hair
if the bank approves them.

441
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,760
Oh, I'd hate to see it sold.

442
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,440
I just wish Nana had told me.

443
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,120
Why?
Are you interested?

444
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,960
Thought about it.

445
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,840
Well, you know the bank
would rather deal with you.

446
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,560
I mean,
you're absolutely no risk.

447
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,720
If you want,
I can talk to Bob Fisher?

448
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,720
Okay.
That'd be nice.

449
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,880
[Henry] My pleasure.

-[car engine stalling]
-[car door closes]

451
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,920
-Thanks for going.
-Thanks for taking me.

452
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,480
It would have been polite
to invite him in.

453
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,360
I've been polite all day.

454
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,720

[upbeat music playing]

459
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,320
[gasps]

460
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,600
Who are you?

461
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,640
The guy who pays the rent.
Who the hell are you?

462
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,760
The guy you pay the rent to.

463
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,920
[chuckles]
I pay old lady Delongpre.

464
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,720
I'm Savannah Delongpre.

465
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,360
You manage a salvage company?

466
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,120
Something like that.

467
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,920
Let me guess.
You're just out here slumming?

468
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,880
No. I'm here to tell you
this isn't for rent anymore.

469
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,160
I'm buying it.

470
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,720
I'm sure you like
throwing your weight around

471
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,840
with the peasants,

472
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,880
but I got a lease
to buy going through.

473
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,160
You're too late.

474
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,800
My family's had a fortune
in that bank for years.

475
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,520
I doubt it.

476
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,480
And before you leave,
I want all this stuff

477
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,280
out of here.

478
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,920
[Bert] So, she said,

479
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,600
"That's not a pig,
that's a dog."

480
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,480
And I said lady
I was talking to the dog.

481
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,520
Oh.

482
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,240
-I'm tired.
-Guess you had to be there.

483
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,400
-Ready?
-Get going. Yeah.

484
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,680
Yeah. You drive?

485
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,600
-Thank you for having us.
-Thanks for coming.

486
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,880
-Thanks for having us.
-[Bell] I wish you'd come more.

487
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,200
I think we're gonna have
to do that.

488
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,200
-Bye, honey.
-Come here. Thanks.

489
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,680
-Thanks. Thanks.
-Are you okay?

490
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,120
I'm great.

491
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,360
I mean, she's almost like this
every single solitary time

492
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,320
I'm in this house, now why's
it getting to you tonight?

493
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,080
Oh, it's not that.
It's just--

494
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,360
well, I had this run in with
the most irritating man today.

495
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,480
-Oh, really? Where?
-Two Moon. Got me in a mood.

496
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,960
Uh-huh. And what were you
doing out there?

497
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,320
He was so arrogant,
he actually thinks

498
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,600
he's gonna buy the place.
And you should see...

499
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,840
-Oh, yeah?
-...what he's done to it.

500
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,280
-He's got all this stuff.
-I bet he was cute.

501
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,440
It was like
his personal junk yard.

502
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,760
-Bet he was cute.
-Tracy?

503
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,320
You're going on too much
about it for him to be ugly.

504
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,720
-Really?
-Umm-hmm. You are.

505
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,080
I'll call you tomorrow.

506
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,600
-Bye.
-[Tracy] Bye.

[Jake] Nothing ever changes
in this town.

519
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,200
Excuse me.
I have an appointment.

520
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,360
Yeah.
I just had one.

521
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,080
When your
great grandfather cheated mine

522
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,120
out of Two Moon,
he just didn't take Two Moon.

523
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,440
He took his whole life
when he took that place.

524

[woman] [indistinct]

526

Yes, ma'am, I did.

527
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,720
I just filed it [indistinct].

00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,120
out of the title to Two Moon?

533
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,200
It's unladylike to burst
in a room like that, Savannah.

534
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,240
Did he?

535
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,440
I have one nerve left, Savannah,
and you're on it.

536
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,960
I want to know.

537
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,640
Who have you been talking to?

538
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,040
Warren Gilbert's great grandson.

539
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,440
Warren Gilbert
was an uncivilized animal.

540
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,080
I don't care what he was like!
Did we still the property?

541
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,160
There was a gentlemanly dispute
about the property lines.

542
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,160
But that's ancient history.
And no need to drag it up now.

543
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,600
And us having more money,
the court listened better?

544
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,280
Savannah?

545
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,720
[sighs]

546
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,080
[crickets chirping]

547
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,880
[country music playing]

548
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,000
[frogs croaking]

549
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,480
This place isn't yours, yet.
You still got to knock.

550
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,240
That swan used to be out front
before a hurricane came through.

551
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,840
I used to think it got tired
of being here and flew away.

552
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,280
What do you want?

553
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,040
You know you're wasted here.
You should go to New York.

554
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,360
This is beautiful.

555
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,320
I don't give a shit
about New York.

556
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,320
And unless you're here
to personally kick me out--

557
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,320
I'm sorry about my grandfather.
I didn't know.

558
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,320
You're gonna have
a hell of a battle on your hands

559
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,920
when you try to take this place.

560
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,560
I'm not an easy mark
like my grandfather was.

561
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,320
That's not what this is about.

562
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,680
We're not our grandparents.

563
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,000
We are who we are.

564
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,760
Look. Forget it.

565
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,000
I came here to apologize
but just forget it.

566
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,880
Where do you come off
being so arrogant?

567
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,480
I went out of my way to find out
if what you said was true.

568
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,240
[romantic music playing]

569
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,200
[moaning]

570
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,760
[romantic music playing]

571
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,480
Hey, girl.

572
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,120
Ha-ha.

573
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,680
Ronnie. Girlfriend.

574
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,160
Woo!

575
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,040
-My luggage.
-Well, you did ask.

576
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,840
Now, I can't believe
you are getting along

577
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,040
without all your shit.

578
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,760
You'd be surprised.

579
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,680
Come on, let's get you settled.

580
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,840
Savannah running around
at all hours by yourself

581
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,440
is asking for trouble.

582
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,360
People talk.

583
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,840
What do you do around here?
Watch the cars rust?

584
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,120
[laughter]

585
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,560
God, Ronnie,
I'm so glad you're here.

586
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,840
You know, Robert's been
a major pain in the ass

587
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,840
since you left him.
You know, I got to find out

588
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,600
what you people put in grits.

589
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,200
You look relaxed.

590
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,760
Oh, God, Ronnie.

591
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,880
Woo! Shit!
What's his name?

592
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,280
Shh!

593
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,600
Did you already?
You slut.

594
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,440
[laughs]

595
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,040
I want to know
every disgusting detail.

596
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,680
Oh, yeah.
He's got this great art.

597
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,280
I want you to check it out.

598
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,240
Is that your [indistinct]
talking or your ass?

599
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:17,160
[birds chirping]

-[laughter]
-Did you sleep good?

603
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,720
Oh, yeah, great.

Cricket symphony
going in the background.

605
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,680
Remind me to get some bug spray.

606
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,440
Ooh.
Must be your perfume.

607
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,240
You mean the one you gave me?

608
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,720
Umm-hmm. So?
So?

609
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,280
Is this it?

610
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,600
You Southerner's
are some weird ass birds.

611
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,960
Fuck you, Ronnie.

612
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,920
I like it. I just might stay.

613
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,160
Whoa.

614
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,480
Whoa, girl.
Reality check, okay?

615
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,680
Robert's got you booked
for Christmas.

616
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,160
Screw Robert.

617
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,040
I don't get paid
enough for that.

618
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,040
Whoa!

619
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,360
I like it.

620
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,880
Have I ever seen this before?

621
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,360
Has he ever had a show?

622
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,680
I don't think so.

623
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,680
What are you doing?

624
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,280
Ronnie has some friends
who run some galleries

625
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,320
and I--
I was thinking that maybe--

626
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,280
I'm not interested.

627
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,920
Little tense, are we?

628
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,000
Look, I was just thinking--

629
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,440
Jake, I hope you realize
how good you are

630
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,240
and you can blow the critics
away with this.

631
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,240
You're in to all that, not me.

632
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,160
Don't try to drag me down
to some higher social level.

633
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,680
That's not what I'm doing.

634
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,640
Okay, okay.
I'm gonna go outside

635
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,720
and play with the crawdads
or something.

636
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,120
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize--

637
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,200
Take a look around, okay?

638
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,320
This is it.

639
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,080
This is me.

640
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,920
I know that.
I know that.

641
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,280
What are you doing?

642
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,760
-What was last night about?
-I'm not sure. Are you?

643
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,800
I don't think you mean that.
I said I was sorry.

644
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,600
We're having a party tomorrow
and I want you to come.

645
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,000
What?
Are you turning trader on me?

646
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,800
A Gilbert's never been behind
Delongpre line.

647
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,080
I thought we were past all that?

648
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,120
Starts at 4:00.

649
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:38,320
He reminds me of this rapper
I used to date.

650
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,800
MC Ice Pick.

651
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:45,360
I think his songs were so good
because he was such an asshole.

652
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,240
Law of proportion, girl.

653
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,760
Oh. I'm sorry he was so rude.

654
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,320
I don't know
what's wrong with him today.

655
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,120
He lives in the middle
of the fucking woods,

656
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,560
that's what's wrong with him.

657
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,560
You realize this could just be
a rebound thing.

658
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,360
Yeah. I know.

659
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,120

Watch your step, girls.

[Tracy] Ooh!
What's so funny in here?

664
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,160
Stop all that laughing.
No more fun.

665
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,400
Savannah and Belle, I want
to get a picture of you

666
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,960
cause I got my camera.
I need a new picture.

667
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,400
Can you just stand up

668
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,120
because I want to get
the sunlight coming in,

669
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,560
so I can catch it
on your pretty face.

670
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,680
Belle, I want to get a picture
of you and Savannah,

671
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,320
so could you two
stand up together.

672
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,520
Yeah.
There we go.

673
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,080
Let's get this in the frame.

674
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,960
Savannah could you move
a little bit closer to Belle.

675
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,560
I did want to
just take one picture

676
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,240
that was the idea.
Okay.

677
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,360
Belle, could you just put
your arm around Savannah there

678
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,800
so we can...

679
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,040
Just put your arm around.
There you go.

680
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,440
Smile pretty for the camera.

681
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,560
Say cheese.
Ah, that is a beautiful picture.

682
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,840
Excuse me.

683
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,960
-[Robert] Hi.
-Hi.

684
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,040
[Savannah]
What are you doing here?

685
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,360
I just couldn't let it go
that easily.

686
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,280
Robert, don't you have a show?

687
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,960
Savannah, you're more important
than any show.

688
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,200
How nice of you to come.

689
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,200
-My pleasure.
-Lovely to see you.

690
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,440
You don't understand
I haven't been alone here.

-[man] Belle? Excuse me, love.

692
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,680
Can you come here a second?

[indistinct chatter]

694
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,080
They've had heat
between them for a lot of years

695
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,560
and they always end up
back on each other's doorstep.

696
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,520
They're cut the same.

697
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,520
Gilberts have no place
in this house.

698
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,240
I can see that.

699
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,800
-Come back with me.
-I'm not ready.

700
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,600
So, where is he today?

701
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,760
This has nothing to do with him.
-You're right.

702
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,640
It was just your way
of getting back at me.

703
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,120
Making me jealous.
It worked.

704
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,400
Robert?

705
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,600
You know you're mine.

706
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,040
You don't belong with anyone.

707
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,560

01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,120
I wish she were here.

885
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:56,960
Sometimes...

886
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,560
sometimes I just wish
I could talk to her.

887
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,080
She used to talk to me
all the time.

888
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,240
Nana never talked to me.

889
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:26,760
I remember the argument Nana
and she had.

890
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,240
I remember that night
she walked out the door

891
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:34,440
and she never came back.

892
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:41,720
After that...

893
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:44,760
after she drowned,

894
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,080
things changed.

895
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,520
Nana, she just kept pulling
more and more away.

896
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,560
And I always thought

897
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:00,760
that maybe one day she'd say,

898
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:04,840
"Good job, Savannah.

899
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,120
I love you, Savannah."

900
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,440
But she never did.

901
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,560
I left the minute
I turned eighteen.

902
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,480
Did you find what you
were looking for in New York?

903
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,280
I thought I had.

904
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,280
But I think
I only found part of it.

905
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:59,960
I promise I'll be there soon.

906
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:01,680
Uh-huh. Ciao.

907
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:04,880
Don't get up.

908
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,440
[Jake] Where are you going?

909
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,960
Well, I have to straighten
some things out with Robert.

910
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,440
He does control my career.

911
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:14,040
-You want me to come?
-No.

912
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:17,080
No. Besides,
I need a new change of clothing.

913
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,080
[chuckles]

914
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,360
When are you back?

915
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,320
I don't know. When I, uh...

916
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,960
settle some things in New York
with Robert,

917
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,760
so he doesn't screw it up
with this French designer.

918
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,160
And, actually, it's kind
of boring business stuff.

919
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:35,960
What?

920
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,320
What? You expect me
to just stop modeling

921
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,160
just like that?
I mean, it's what I do.

922
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:45,160
You go back there you get
sucked in that life again.

923
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:47,960
Give me some credit, Jake.

924
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,320
You'll be there, I'll be here.

925
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:55,600
[Savannah]
This is not a big deal.

926
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,960
I mean, this is what
we have planes for.

927
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,880
I can visit you,
you'll visit me.

928
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,360
I can't go back to that.

929
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,000
Jake,

930
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:14,280
don't make me
make a decision like this.

931
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,480
I think you already have.

932
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:35,840
I love you.

933
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,200
[birds chirping]

934
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,360
[engine revving]

935
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,000
Good morning.

936
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:08,880
Your grandma isn't up
too much of anything today.

937
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,760
Says the party did her in.

938
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,440
Why don't you take it in to her.

939
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:16,720
[knocks on door]

940
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:29,200
[Belle] Thank you.

941
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:34,040
I left you a package.
Did you get it?

942
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,200
I don't need a new cane,
Savannah.

943
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,160
[Tracy]
This is so good. Mm.

944
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:49,960
That really hit the spot.

945
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,320
Mm.

946
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:54,520
Now, that looks good.

947
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,160
-You want some?
-No.

948
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:57,960
I already feel
like Mrs. Mack truck.

949
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:58,920
I don't need more.

950
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,400
So, what's going on with you
and Jake?

951
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,480
I haven't seen much of you.
I could always use

952
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,920
-a little vicarious thrill.
-Oh, well, he's great.

953
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:07,360
-It's great.
-Uh-hmm. But?

954
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,720
But what?

955
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,600
Well, there's always
a but in there. But what?

956
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,520
He picks his toenails after,
or he's a pathological liar?

957
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:14,680
-No.
-There's always a but

958
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:15,960
after all the heavy
breathing stops.

959
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,800
He doesn't want me
to go to New York.

960
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,520
Uh-hmm. But what do you want?

961
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,000
Him. Both.

962
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,520
Oh, right. And I want Ed McMahon
to come to my door

963
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,360
and give me a check
for a million dollars.

964
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:28,320
[laughs] No, seriously,
this is different.

965
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:29,440
Uh-hmm.

966
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,160
Oh, Lord, I heard
that one before.

967
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,400
[exhales]

968
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,800
That does look good.

969
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,240
-I don't need anymore.
-Sure. Have it. Go ahead.

970
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,000
-No. I shouldn't. I shouldn't.
-Yeah.

971
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,320
-You don't mind?
-No.

972
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,360
Okay.

973
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:47,360
[Henry] Savannah, I have been
trying to get a hold of you.

974
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,240
Oh? Well, I've been staying out
at the summer place.

975
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:53,160
-Seems to be agreeing with you.
-It is. It is.

976
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,160
-I wish I'd known.
-Well, nobody did really.

977
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:58,120
Are you okay?

978
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,640
I'm sorry, Savannah.

979
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,880
The bank wouldn't wait.
You didn't pursue the deed.

980
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,680
Oh, that's okay. That's what
I stopped by to tell you.

981
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:08,840
I'm not buying Two Moon anymore.
I want Jake to have it.

982
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,400
Well, they refused his loan.

983
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,320
And Mr. Lee made
such a good offer.

984
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,480
-What?
-Well, I told your grandmother.

985
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:15,880
You talked to her?

986
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,560
Well, I tried to get to you.

987
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,800
Now, I had to let her know
about Mr. Lee's offer.

988
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,000
And then she didn't seem
to think you were interested

989
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,000
in the property anymore
and she wouldn't wait.

990
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:26,240
Well, I'll just go talk
to my grandmother

991
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,760
-and to the bank.
-I'm sorry, Savannah.

992
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,600
Paper's already signed.

993
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:44,600
-She's not here.
-I know.

994
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,520
She's okay?

995
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,120
Nothing happened?

996
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:52,440
She's okay.

997
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,760
I already told you,
I'm not interested in New York.

998
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,920
[Ronnie]
That's not why I'm here.

999
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:01,280
Then why are you here?

1000
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,160
This is his wedding gift to her.

1001
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,080
Robert bought Two Moon.

1002
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,240
She said she was going
to New York.

1003
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:17,880
She is.

1004
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:18,960
With him.

1005
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:21,800
They'll vacation here
between shows.

1006
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,560
He's giving you two weeks
to vacate.

1007
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:26,840
The hell he is.

1008
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:38,760
[car engine revving]

1009
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,280
-Where's Jake?
-He's already gone.

1010
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:03,720
You helped Robert buy Two Moon.

1011
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,880
He can make or break me,
Savannah.

1012
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,760
It's just business.

1013
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:11,400
Is it?

1014
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:17,640
[birds chirping]

1015
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,280
-Where is she?
-She isn't in.

1016
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,320
[Robert] Ruth.

1017
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,240
Is there anything else
of Savannah's?

1018
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:39,280
I think you have taken it all,
Mr. Lee.

1019
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,560
Thank you, Ruth.

1020
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,280
She's better off with me.

1021
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,800
Oh really?

1022
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:46,920
Is that why she's coming back
to New York?

1023
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,760
She's going back
for the modeling.

1024
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,160
You really think
she'll last out here

1025
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,360
for more than a week?

1026
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,000
She was confused.

1027
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,840
She was just trying
to get back at me.

1028
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,320
I don't believe that.

1029
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:57,760
Believe it, pal.

1030
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,400
She speaks three languages.

1031
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,240
She's gonna own New York
in a year.

1032
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,280
Do you really think
that you're enough for her?

1033
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,160
Come on...

1034
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,720
Haven't you figured it out yet?

1035
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,560
You were just a distraction.

1036
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,080
[door slams shut]

1037
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:39,200
[car engine revving]

1038
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:54,320
Oh, absolutely. I was thinking
two weeks she'd be ready for.

1039
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:56,200
-Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.
-What the hell do you think

1040
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,920
-you're doing?
-Look. We'll be back

1041
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,840
in a few days.
Let's talk logistics then, okay?

1042
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,760
She looks great.
We'd love to.

1043
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:02,760
Okay, ciao.

1044
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:06,560
-Cleo has a new design for you.
-I don't care about Cleo.

1045
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:07,880
[Robert] I don't think
you mean that?

1046
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:08,680
You bought Two Moon.

1047
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,560
For you.
As a wedding gift.

1048
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,400
Savannah, I know you want
your independence.

1049
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:17,760
And this other guy...

1050
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:19,360
Forget about him.

1051
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:24,480
Robert, it doesn't work.

1052
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:26,040
It has never worked.

1053
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:28,680
Give me another chance.

1054
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,080
Maybe we should just
say goodbye now.

1055
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:34,480
I made you.

1056
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:37,520
I made myself.

1057
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,520
Savannah? Savannah?
Savannah?

1058
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:41,480
Maybe I shouldn't be
with your agency anymore.

1059
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,160
Savannah?
Savannah?

1060
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,800
You will regret this.

1061
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,840
Don't tell me about regrets.

1062
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,520
I'm not stiff and cold

1063
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:01,640
and locked up
in a big empty house

1064
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:02,920
with no one to love.

1065
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,240
I won't listen to you
talk like that.

1066
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,840
You won't listen to anything.

1067
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,040
You won't feel anything.

1068
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:13,200
I've waited for years for you
to look at me and smile

1069
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:14,800
as if you were happy to see me.

1070
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,560
Well, I'm not gonna
wait anymore.

1071
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,720
My mother did not drown
on purpose.

1072
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,680
And you can go on blaming her
and hating me

1073
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:26,880
because I remind you
of her all you want.

1074
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:29,480
But don't count on me
to be around for it.

1075
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:38,440
Flight's at 8:00.

1076
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,760
We'll be arriving back
in the 20th century.

1077
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,680
Thank God, in time
for a late dinner

1078
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:45,400
where we don't have to worry
about anyone seeing you all.

1079
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,720
I want you to talk to her.

1080
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:50,040
You talk to her, Robert.

1081
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,360
I think I've already
done enough.

1082
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,000
Don't give up on her.

1083
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,760
I haven't.
She's given up on me.

1084
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:11,120
[dramatic music playing]

1085
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,000
[car engine revving]

1086
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:33,000
[sobbing]

1087
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:46,720
One of these days you're gonna
stop letting people go.

1088
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,680
That is, if the good Lord
let's you live long enough

1089
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:51,240
to realize you've been wrong.

1090
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,280
You may have lost
your true love,

1091
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,360
but Savannah doesn't have
to lose hers.

1092
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:59,920
[birds chirping]

1093
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:22,400
I told Mr. Lee
I want Two Moon back.

1094
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:26,280
I don't want it.

1095
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:29,960
Savannah, when I first saw Jake,
I couldn't believe

1096
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,040
how much he looked like
his granddaddy Luke.

1097
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:36,320
Look. I don't want to talk about
what the Gilberts did or Jake.

1098
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:37,840
Besides, it doesn't matter,
he's gone.

1099
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:39,240
Savannah, wait.

1100
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:45,320
I loved Luke Gilbert
with all my heart.

1101
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:48,960
We used to meet out at Two Moon.

1102
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:52,400
His daddy owned it.
[chuckles]

1103
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:55,200
It was the only place
we could go and be alone.

1104
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:00,520
His daddy and my daddy
just hated each other.

1105
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,240
I never did know why.

1106
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:08,320
When they found out
we were seeing one another,

1107
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,720
my daddy wanted
to send me away to school,

1108
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,320
and his daddy told him
he'd kill him

1109
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:15,080
if he ever stepped foot
near me again.

1110
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:17,520
Did you?

1111
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:21,760
We just couldn't be apart.

1112
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,240
Luke was waiting for me
at the bridge one night.

1113
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,160
But his daddy must have
followed him

1114
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,000
because by the time I got there,
they were having

1115
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:32,360
a terrible fight.

1116
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:34,880
Luke was yelling about me.

1117
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:39,080
And his daddy was hitting him
every time he said my name.

1118
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:40,520
He was hurt so bad.

1119
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:45,120
[sighs] Savannah,

1120
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,040
if I've been hard on you,

1121
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:51,320
it's because you're so much
like your mother

1122
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:54,560
and so like me
and I was afraid

1123
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,560
that what happened to her
would happen to you.

1124
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,200
She drowned because
of the current, Nana.

1125
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:01,320
It was an accident.

1126
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,360
It would please me so much
if you would stay

1127
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:09,160
and have dinner with me tonight.

1128
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:13,320
[dramatic music playing]

1129
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,880
[Savannah] Incredibly frantic.

1130
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:25,720
And sometimes we'd have up
to ten changes

1131
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,920
in less than a half--
in less than a half hour.

1132
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:30,560
And rushing, you know,
two minutes to change

1133
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,440
completely different styles.

1134
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,040
Oh, it's just [indistinct].

1135
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:35,560
[chuckles]

1136
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,600
Well, I don't know.

1137
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:43,240
[birds chirping]

1138
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:50,640
Need help?

1139
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:52,680
Oh. No. Thanks.
I just...

1140
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,120
What time's the train?

1141
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,040
Um, at 8:00.

1142
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:58,720
-It's a nice ride to Atlanta.
-Yeah.

1143
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,240
And he's a great designer.

1144
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:01,800
I think it's gonna be
a good show.

1145
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:04,120
-I'm glad you stayed.
-Me too.

1146
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,600
Okay.

1147
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:09,480
I love you, Nana Belle.

1148
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:10,640
I love you, darling.

1149
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:12,360
Now you be careful.

1150
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,760
[car door closes]

1151

[horse neighs]

1153
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,360
[man] Thank you.

1154
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:56,960
[dispatcher over PA]

[woman chuckles]

1157
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:35,760
[woman] I missed you.

1158
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,640
[man] [indistinct]
Did you miss me?

1159
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:45,640
[indistinct chatter]

1160
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:46,960
[woman laughs]

1161
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:51,840
[man] Do you know how long
it takes to get to Atlanta?

1162
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:54,240
[man 2] It takes about an hour
and a half, sir.

1163
