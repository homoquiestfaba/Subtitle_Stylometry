I Iove my mommy.

52
00:17:14,316 --> 00:17:15,874
That's not my mommy!

53
00:17:42,077 --> 00:17:45,513
Are you fixing dinner again, Mommy?

54
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,678
Now, you sit right down
and give me that spoon.

55
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:51,648
You're a nice mommy...

56

65
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:31,959
...by gosh, Mama's gonna have

That's my mommy!

71
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,235
We interrupt
to announce that a dancing bear...

72
00:20:31,446 --> 00:20:33,175
...has wandered away
from the carnival.

73
00:20:33,382 --> 00:20:36,647
He is a trained bear
and will dance if he hears music.

74
00:20:36,852 --> 00:20:39,150
Do not be alarmed, he is harmless.

75
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,183
Contact your local police.

76
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:45,918
A big reward will be paid
for the return of the dancing bear.

77
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:19,902
Your attention, please.

78
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:21,700
We interrupt this program...

79
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:25,812
...to announce that the reward for
the missing bear has been doubled.

80
00:24:26,014 --> 00:24:28,039

...notify your police department
at once.

82
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:59,076

What's the matter with you,

102
00:33:41,235 --> 00:33:45,729
