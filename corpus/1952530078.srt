1
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,947
There's not a sermon
l could preach here,

2
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:23,147
that would be acceptable!

3
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:24,382
<i>(Susanna) Now, Samuel,</i>
<i>you're overreacting!</i>

4
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:27,153
Oh, you know what l mean.

5
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,661
Just because l'm a royalist,
the children are ostracized.

6
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:33,232
You are ignored in
the marketplace

7
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,824
and everything l do is opposed.

8
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:37,960
And it's not just the commoners.

9
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,936
The landowners
are just as bad....

10
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:55,385
<i>(Voice) Fire!</i>

11
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:56,978
Everyone out of the house.

12
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,079
<i>(Girl's Voice)</i>
<i>Get the baby!</i>

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,788
<i>(Voices) Fire!</i>

14
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,308
<i>(Susanna) Jackie,</i>
<i>where are you?</i>

15
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:27,810
Mum?

16
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:35,160
[scream]

17
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:05,479
What proof have we,
as reasonable men,

18
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:08,918
of the existence of a Creator?

19
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:13,823
Consider, l beseech
you, the universe.

20
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:17,021
The planets that
circle the sun,

21
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,099
moons that revolve
about the planets,

22
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,566
the universe as a machine.

23
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:23,931
The watch.

24
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:28,697
The watch!

25
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,777
Proclaims the watch maker.

26
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,605
Mum, l'm hungry.

27
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,579
Here you go.

28
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:40,050
Now shut yertrap.

29
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:43,020
This entire nation
is soaked in gin.

30
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:45,215
What do they do about it?

31
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,917
Can you spare a penny, sir.

32
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:47,993
For me babe?

33
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,254
Gin for your belly,
more likely.

34
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,522
There'll be no begging here.

35
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,494
Move along.

36
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,429
l can stand here
if l've a mind to.

37
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,057
Are you familiar
with Bocardo Prison?

38
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:55,930
Aye, l am.

39
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,059
You'll have no
trouble from me.

40
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:57,761
No, sir.

41
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,269
l'll be on me way.

42
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,602
Meet us there
this afternoon.

43
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,970
We've food for
you and the child.

44
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,043
<i>(Woman) Bless you, sir</i>.

45
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,270
What do you mean by
this, John Wesle<i>y?</i>.

46
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,404
Encouraging the woman?

47
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,608
lt's bad enough her kind
roams the streets with the pigs,

48
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:15,210
but l will not have them
befouling our Sacred grounds.

49
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,619
We strive to fulfill
our religious duty

50
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,749
by performing acts
of charity...

51
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,885
Christian charity, sir.

52
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:26,955
You and your so
called ''Holy club!''

53
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:30,934
lt's nothing but a way
to flaunt your piety.

54
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,766
There is a proper
place for religion,

55
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,703
and most of us
want it kept there.

56
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,069
Yes, l'm sure you would.

57
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:40,771
We are very happy as we are,
sir, and that does not include

58
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,839
sharing the Churchyard
with the devil's spawn.

59
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:56,684
Oh, God bless you, Mr. Wesley,
God bless you!

60
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,730
lsn't it wonderful?

61
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,389
<i>(John) Well we do</i>
<i>what little we can</i>...

62
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,331
Oh, no not you!

63
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,062
lt's Mr. Oglethorpe.

64
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,398
Haven't you heard?

65
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,769
He's opening the
debtor's prisons,

66
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:11,435
taking them all to
America for a new start.

67
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:15,538
Come along, everyone!

68
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:25,619
You don't know much,
Mr. Wesley, and that's a fact.

69
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,285
lt's not people like
you that change things.

70
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,554
lt's men of action.

71
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,095
Men like Oglethorpe.

72
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,664
Them what's got the power.

73
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:35,256
What you do don't
make no difference at all.

74
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:47,438
He's right, you know.

75
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:55,186
We could build charity schools,
alms houses forthe poor,

76
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,448
and give our time
and money to others,

77
00:05:56,556 --> 00:06:02,119
but in the end it really
doesn't change very much.

78
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,788
Yes, but we must
try, Charles.

79
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,524
We must insure
our own salvation,

80
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:07,690
if nothing else.

81
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:13,036
Yes, we must try.

82
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,172
<i>(John) l'm planning a lesson</i>
<i>on Deuteronomy 12</i>.

83
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:22,213
Mr. White is bringing a
guest to the Holy Club today.

84
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,304
Very good!

85
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,474
Anew member, perhaps?

86
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:25,573
One can hope.

87
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:32,755
Mr. Whitefield, we each abide
by a strict method of living.

88
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,487
We rise earlyfor prayer
and study of the Scriptures.

89
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:38,257
We meet at an appointed
time for self- examination.

90
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:40,764
And we fulfill our
religious duties

91
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,893
by performing certain
works of charity together.

92
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,995
l believe God requires
rigid self discipline.

93
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,903
Exactly, Mr. Whitefield.

94
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,168
Exactly.

95
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:53,006
l see you will make an
excellent member of our club.

96
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:53,942
Please join us.

97
00:06:56,482 --> 00:07:00,680
Now, on to business
shall we say.

98
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,015
[knocking]

99
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,349
Amessage for you, Sir.

100
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,187
What is it, brother?

101
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,461
<i>Come</i>.

102
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,531
Ah, Mr. Wesley!

103
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,766
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

104
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,177
Allow me introduce you
to my friend and ally,

105
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,746
Tomochichi.

106
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,179
Without him, l'm afraid
my little enterprise

107
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,773
would have been
a dismal failure.

108
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,219
Please.

109
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,248
Your enterprise?

110
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:41,190
Sir, you are talking about
your Georgia colon<i>y?</i>.

111
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,659
Quite so.

112
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,159
Mr. Wesley, let me be frank.

113
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:51,862
l need to ask you a question
ortwo about your beliefs.

114
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,836
My...beliefs?

115
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,569
As you may know, my Georgia
colony is funded in part

116
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,168
by the Societyforthe Promotion
of Christian Knowledge.

117
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,804
Yes a most noble
organization, sir.

118
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:05,475
We have concern
that the debtors,

119
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:06,745
who form the bulk
of our settlers,

120
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,947
have spiritual counsel
in their new situation.

121
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,457
Asituation which will be
primitive and challenging

122
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,550
in itself.

123
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,821
ln the last several years,

124
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,955
l have visited half the
parish churches in England.

125
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:23,092
And thus it has been my
misfortune to hear sermons

126
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:26,262
by almost half the clergy
of the Church of England.

127
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,772
Do you know
what, Mr. Wesley?

128
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,571
Most of those sermons
contained no more Christianity

129
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,373
than a page out of Cicero.

130
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,675
Philosophical platitudes
mixed up with toadying

131
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,374
to the local gentry.

132
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,281
Rarely a mention
of the Saviour,

133
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,411
rarely a sense
of the Scripture.

134
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,253
You consider yourself to be
a Christian, Mr. Wesle<i>y?</i>.

135
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,192
Why, yes, of course, sir.

136
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,228
Most assuredly.

137
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,764
When you have the
occasion to preach,

138
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,890
do you speak about
the Scriptures

139
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,662
or do you quote philosophers?

140
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,396
l am most interested in
the study and teaching

141
00:08:58,504 --> 00:08:59,937
of Scriptures, sir.

142
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,440
And do you believe in order?

143
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:07,240
Order and method are
central to my life.

144
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:10,076
Very well, Mr. Wesley.

145
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,446
l have a proposition for you...

146
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,483
What of my work here, Charles?

147
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,114
We've come so far, yet
we've so much furtherto go.

148
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:23,559
Am l to simply abandon it?

149
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,564
You are not the only
member of the society, John.

150
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,930
Are the rest of us not capable?

151
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,833
And what if l fail?

152
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:35,931
What if l'm not able
to endure the hardship?

153
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:39,239
l must, above all else,
ensure my salvation.

154
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,313
l know of no one more
able to endure hardship

155
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,245
than you, brother.

156
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:47,786
As for saving your soul,
you will be doing God's work,

157
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:48,410
not man's.

158
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,510
ls that not so?

159
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:56,056
Jackie!

160
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,322
Oh, my baby.

161
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,795
Mom!

162
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,690
Mom!

163
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:05,669
You're like a brand
plucked from the burning.

164
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:10,970
Truly God has saved you
for some great purpose.

165
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,011
Oh, Jackie!

166
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:17,344
<i>Truly God surely saved</i>
<i>you for some great purpose</i>.

167
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,625
<i>Jackie, what a calling!</i>

168
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,127
Your Fatherwould
have been so proud.

169
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,558
Do sit down, Samuel.

170
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,032
You'll wear a groove
in the floor.

171
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,466
l'll have you know,

172
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,597
l am completely opposed
to this ridiculous scheme.

173
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:45,108
Who will care for Mother
now that Father has passed?

174
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,442
lt's bad enough you
refused the pastorate

175
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,037
which would have
provided you with a living

176
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,276
and a home for her
and our sisters.

177
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:53,374
But this!

178
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,454
l will not preach
where l am not wanted.

179
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:58,387
And you know the people
of Epworth will reject me

180
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,254
just as they rejected Father.

181
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,849
l believe that my salvation lies

182
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,896
in bringing Christ
to the heathens.

183
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,487
You should have seen this man.

184
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,432
Amore noble man never existed.

185
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,230
lt is preposterous.

186
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,736
l am washing my hands of it.

187
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,679
Thank you, Mother.

188
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,078
Such an endeavor!

189
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,047
lt will be a great loss to me,

190
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:28,587
but if l had twenty sons,
l would send them all!

191
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,054
l'm so glad you feel that way.

192
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,318
Charles is coming with us.

193
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,188
Me?

194
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,723
l'm not going to Georgia!

195
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,458
Well most certainly you are.

196
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:41,897
The General needs two men.

197
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,400
One to serve at Savannah

198
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:46,369
and the other to serve as his
secretary at Fort Frederica.

199
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,133
What is this?

200
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,765
Without even so much as
a by-your-leave, Charlie?

201
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,776
Charles, look,
it's perfect.

202
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,506
Oglethorpe asked me to
recommend the second man

203
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:56,603
and l've recommended you!

204
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,014
John! l'm not going to Georgia.

205
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,210
l'm happy here.

206
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,651
l need Oxford, l need
the literary society,

207
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,313
l need the library!

208
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:05,617
l'm not like you.

209
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:09,161
Charles, l am convinced that
this is the opportunity

210
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:12,822
our society needs to
further God's work.

211
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,365
And you heard Mother,

212
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,300
a blessed occupation,
she called it!

213
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,668
Also you'll need to be serving
as chaplain of Frederica.

214
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:21,831
Well there you have it,
l can't go.

215
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,875
You know that l'm not ordained.

216
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,876
l've already spoken to
the Bishop of Oxford

217
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,969
and you're to be
ordained this Sunday.

218
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:36,020
We agreed long ago as a family

219
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:40,218
that l was not cut of the
cloth for ordination.

220
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,089
You agreed with Samuel.

221
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,628
Most emphatically, as l recall.

222
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,129
lt's all been taken
care of, Charlie.

223
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,563
so don't make such a fuss!

224
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,156
Besides that, Mr. Delamotte
and Mr. lngham,

225
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,565
they're coming as well.

226
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:54,196
John Wesley, you are the most
interfering insufferable brother

227
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,365
a man has ever been tested by!

228
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,102
l am not going to be ordained

229
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,509
and l most certainly am
NOT going to Georgia!

230
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:04,973
<i>(Voice) l now ordain</i>
<i>you as a deacon</i>

231
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,642
<i>of the Church of England</i>.

232
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:10,051
Called by the Holy Spirit
to all the honors,

233
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:13,922
duties and responsibilities...

234
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,859
Oh, Mr. Wesley, l'm so
glad that your brother

235
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,827
is following the will of God.

236
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,525
This is not the
will of God.

237
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,101
This is the will of John!

238
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:34,371
<i>(Captain)</i>
<i>Save your prayers Mr. Wesley,</i>
<i>for when we'll need them</i>.

239
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,914
<i>We shan't sink today</i>.

240
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,177
No, l like a storm at
the start of a voyage,

241
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:42,880
it pulls the crew together!

242
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:43,886
Oh Charles.

243
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,617
[laughing]

244
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,454
He'll get his sea
legs soon enough.

245
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,621
Aye, but not till he's
retched out his guts!

246
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,360
[laughing]

247
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:59,164
l'll shall not forgive you.

248
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:00,761
Take heart, Charlie.

249
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:02,898
lt is by suffering
that we come to know God.

250
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,431
Would you open the
door, please, John.

251
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,148
That's the Moravians.

252
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,046
l hope to learn
more about them.

253
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,122
lt sounds like angels singing.

254
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,558
Why can't we sing like
that in our services?

255
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:30,351
[singing]

256
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:33,863
Mr. Wesley, l see you
have found your sea legs.

257
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,399
Quite so, Mr. Oglethorpe.

258
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,469
John was a devoted nurse.

259
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,594
And how goes it
with you, Mr. Wesle<i>y?</i>.

260
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,866
Are you whipping the
passengers into shape?

261
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,305
<i>(John) lt is our</i> mo<i>st</i>
<i>fervent desire</i>

262
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,501
<i>that we should</i>
<i>improve the souls</i>

263
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,872
<i>of everyone on this ship</i>.

264
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,538
Anoble aspiration, indeed.

265
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,377
To that end, we have
organized the day.

266
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:53,417
Eight o'clock, morning prayers
in the main cabin,

267
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,680
Nine o'clock until noon,
private instruction.

268
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,552
Two until four after
dinner, more instruction -

269
00:15:58,657 --> 00:15:59,885
Mr. Wesley!

270
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:03,758
l understand your desire to
abstain from wine and spirits

271
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,523
but to forego meat!

272
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,191
Why, you'll wither away.

273
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,791
Who will save our souls then?

274
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,894
l seek to save my own
soul Captain as well,

275
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,836
through abstinence.

276
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,400
Something to which you might
also give due consideration.

277
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:22,708
Well, l think l'll stick to
prayer, if you don't mind.

278
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,942
lt's always served
me verywell.

279
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,642
But prayer is not enough.

280
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,310
We must regulate the
body as well as the soul.

281
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:45,268
l shall be reading today
from William Law's

282
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:48,033
''Practical Treatise Upon
Christian Perfection.''

283
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,903
<i>(Harker) Can you not give it</i>
<i>a rest, man?</i>

284
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,102
<i>There's others here who</i>
<i>what don't give a bloody fig</i>

285
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,701
<i>for your constant chatter!</i>

286
00:16:58,984 --> 00:16:59,882
William Law's

287
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:05,321
''Practical Treatise on Christian
Perfection,'' Mr. Harker!

288
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:06,356
Heathen.

289
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,372
Take heart, Jackie.

290
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,142
Avery wise man
once told me,

291
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,980
lt is by such suffering
we come to know God.

292
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,187
(Delamotte) What did you
think of Mr. Wesley's sermon

293
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:45,285
this morning?

294
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:53,300
He speaks a great deal
about becoming perfect.

295
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,636
Yes, it is his
hope of heaven.

296
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:03,841
lt doesn't seem
like hope to me.

297
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,814
lt seems more like fear.

298
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,764
Sir! l insist that
Mr. Harker...

299
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,337
Pass the word for Mr. Elliot.

300
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,700
Spread the word.

301
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,000
... that Mr. Harker be flogged.

302
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,167
Mr. Smithers, what is the glass?

303
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,504
<i>(Smithers) lt's gone</i>
<i>below 2</i>9 <i>inches, sir,</i>

304
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,509
<i>and falling</i>.

305
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,237
l will not let this pass!

306
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,278
The man has been rude -

307
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,210
Yes, Captain?

308
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,045
Mr. Elliot, we're in for a
blow, no doubt about it.

309
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:40,516
Hail the mizzen and
trim the mainsail.

310
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,450
Right away sir.

311
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:47,958
Mr. Wesley, l would suggest
that you return to your cabin.

312
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:52,053
lmmediately.

313
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:55,600
And Mr. Wesley, now is
the time for your prayers.

314
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:17,311
[prayers]

315
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:25,796
[screams]

316
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:37,241
[singing]

317
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,936
lt's a good thing
we're close to Georgia.

318
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:43,412
lt will be slow sailing
with only two masts.

319
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,540
Aye.

320
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,209
What are you
standing around for?

321
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,877
Get to cleaning up this mess!

322
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,253
Would you care
for a bit of help?

323
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,657
Yes!

324
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,060
They're not the most
courteous sort, are the<i>y?</i>.

325
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:06,263
Brother Nitschmann, l was
watching your group last night.

326
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,863
l could not help but notice
that they did not seem afraid.

327
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,135
Do you know what he said?

328
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,403
What?

329
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,708
''Why should we be afraid?''

330
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,213
Yes.

331
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,546
How can they not be?

332
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,619
Lord knows, l thought
the end had come.

333
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,119
l don't know.

334
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,622
But they have a
peace l don't have.

335
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,248
And a confidence
l certainly don't feel.

336
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:37,866
Strange as it sounded though,
l found it very intriguing.

337
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,736
<i>(Little John) lf you do well,</i>
<i>will you be accepted?</i>

338
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:46,572
<i>And if you do not do well,</i>
<i>sin is crouching at the door,</i>

339
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:49,806
its desire is for you,
but you must master it.

340
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,383
Genesis 4:6.

341
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:57,922
And will you do well, Jackie,
orwill sin be your master?

342
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:01,151
l wish to be accepted,
Mother, so l will do well.

343
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,727
And how will you do that?

344
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:07,094
Do you have a plan by
which you will lead your life?

345
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,032
l will not be so
bad as other children.

346
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,399
Well that's a very
noble aspiration,

347
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:17,339
but is it enough, do you think,
to gain admission into heaven?

348
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:21,071
l shall read my Bible, go to
church and pray every day.

349
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,703
<i>(Susanna)</i>
<i>ls it enough, do you think,</i>

350
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:28,514
<i>to gain admission</i>
<i>into heaven?</i>

351
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,291
l feel that l am not
doing enough to serve God.

352
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,557
How could you possibly
do more, John?

353
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,997
Every minute of your
day is in his service.

354
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:48,405
Earlier, l had thought
that l should like to marry.

355
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:52,443
But l don't see how you can be
devoted to both God and a wife?

356
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:54,068
There's simply not room
in my heart for both.

357
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:04,219
Yes, l think l shall remain
single, devoted only to God.

358
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,517
l think that's
rather a good idea.

359
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,222
Do you?

360
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,727
The thought of you breeding
actually turn my stomach.

361
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:17,963
<i>(Sailor) Land ho!</i>

362
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,242
Georgia!

363
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,369
Anew world.

364
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:06,176
'Ere!

365
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:09,447
Don't you touch me beans!

366
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,545
l was told that this was
to be my garden, sir.

367
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:19,195
Aye, that it is, but
l'm to care for it.

368
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:20,594
l took care of it
for Reverend Quincy,

369
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,997
l'll take care of it for you.

370
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:26,696
James Locke, yerworship.

371
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,296
'Mr Wesley' will do.

372
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:33,538
Pleased to meet you, Mr Locke.

373
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:37,172
lf l may, l don't see any
of the medicinal herbs spouted.

374
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:40,615
Ahh, ye'll find those in
the Bovey Sisters' garden.

375
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:43,654
They place much
stock in them.

376
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:47,213
l just grow beans and taters
and turnips and the like.

377
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:53,288
l'm most interested in
physic and cures of the sort.

378
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:56,890
Yer'll be most popular then, the
folk do love to be physicked.

379
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,000
But l don't believe
we've ever had a parson

380
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,732
that did the bleedin'.

381
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,707
Oh, no, nothing like that.

382
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,677
But l'm interested in the use
of herbs and common items

383
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,747
that can be used for
medicinal purposed.

384
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,543
l'm writing a book on it.

385
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:19,614
Oh -- l were to tell yer
that the magistrate

386
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:20,622
expects you fer dinner.

387
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:23,660
You and Mr. Delamotte.

388
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,787
Yer'd best not be late.

389
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:55,920
[speaking in French]

390
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:59,190
l wonder, could we not
make an arrangement?

391
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:04,200
My Sophie would be most grateful
should you consent to teach her.

392
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:07,863
lt would be a delight.

393
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:10,237
How did you find the
school, Mr. Delamotte?

394
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,775
Was it to your satisfaction?

395
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,003
Quite so.

396
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:16,046
The children seem
eagerto learn.

397
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:18,672
Mr. Causton, l was wondering,

398
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:22,651
how soon might l obtain a
guide to the lndian nations?

399
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:24,813
There'll be no need forthat.

400
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:30,327
Your job is here, ministering
to the people of Savannah.

401
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:31,292
But l had hoped that l could
bring the word of God

402
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:32,192
to the savages.

403
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,231
lt is my principal
purpose for coming to Georgia.

404
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,459
lt is quite impossible.

405
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:39,901
The natives are at
warwith each other.

406
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,336
But Mr. Oglethorpe assured me -

407
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:45,466
Perhaps, Mr. Wesley could
visit the trading post?

408
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,442
Surely there could
be no harm in that.

409
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:56,349
As long as he does not
neglect his duties here,

410
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:57,421
l have no objection.

411
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:12,428
What harm does it do, to
adorn ourselves with gold,

412
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:15,506
or pearls, or costly array?

413
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,165
lt naturally tends
to breed vanity,

414
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:18,640
and by vanity l mean,

415
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:22,645
the love and desire to
be admired and praised.

416
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,011
That was an excellent sermon.

417
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,243
Mr. Causton was
none to happy with it

418
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:30,287
but l think you made
a friend with his wife.

419
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:32,822
We must always speak the truth,
no matter how much it offends.

420
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:39,796
J'ai, tu as, il a ...

421
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:43,891
l have, thou hast,
he has...

422
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:48,769
J'ai, tu as, il a.

423
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,363
Nous avons.

424
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:52,102
Excellent!

425
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,700
You are a wonderfully
quick learner.

426
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:54,836
Oh, l love learning.

427
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,005
l want to know everything
about our world.

428
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:00,942
Do you also desire
to learn about God?

429
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:02,849
Especially about God.

430
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,854
Without God, our lives
would be dull indeed.

431
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,719
Would you also like to
study the scriptures?

432
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:14,424
Yes, Mr. Wesley,
l'd like that very much.

433
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,676
Quit yerfighting.

434
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,447
There's plenty more
where that came from.

435
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,159
Cusseta!

436
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,437
This is MicoApokta,

437
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:07,814
the Speaker of
the Osochi tribe.

438
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,513
Erkenvkv Wesley
ossetv Osochi.

439
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,756
What do you wish
to preach to us?

440
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,988
l wish to preach to you
of God's Son, Jesus.

441
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:24,098
We have heard of this Ye-sus.

442
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,432
Catolico priests
have visited us.

443
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,597
They tell us of this Ye-sus,

444
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,232
and that we must be
good and give up evil.

445
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:32,331
Yes, that is correct!

446
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:37,748
lt is the white man that
must put locks on his doors

447
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:40,215
to protect from
otherwhite men.

448
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,786
The Creek do not need locks.

449
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,548
l cannot argue with that.

450
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:45,680
Many white men are evil,

451
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,257
and l preach to
stop their evil.

452
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:55,793
lf you come to Osochi to
listen as well as to talk,

453
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,030
perhaps you will learn new
things of the Great Spirit.

454
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:01,628
Yes, yes.

455
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,604
l would like that.

456
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:25,822
<i>(John) My dreams are all</i>
<i>offire or of the storm</i>.

457
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,398
<i>l am terrified of dying</i>.

458
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,467
<i>Where is my faith?</i>

459
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:38,404
This is not why l
stopped you today.

460
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:42,640
ls there something on
your mind, Herr Wesle<i>y?</i>.

461
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:47,207
ls it that obvious?

462
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:50,685
Yes.

463
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,756
The storm on the ship.

464
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:03,099
l was very much afraid
to die, Herr Nitschmann.

465
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:08,935
And it tells me that there is
something lacking in my faith.

466
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,168
Perhaps you should
talk to Herr Spangenburg.

467
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:13,574
Come with me.

468
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:26,246
Herr Spangenburg, l believe
there is something lacking

469
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:28,917
in my relationship with God.

470
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,051
And l was wondering,

471
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,356
how does one obtain a
faith such as yours?

472
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:41,033
First l must ask you a
question ortwo, Herr Wesley.

473
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:43,767
Do you have the
witness within yourself?

474
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:48,137
l'm not sure l understand
what that means.

475
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:51,909
Does the Holy Spirit of God
bearwitness in your heart,

476
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,574
that you are a child of God?

477
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:59,419
Do you know that Jesus
Christ is your Savior?

478
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,856
Yes, l know that Jesus is
the Savior of the world.

479
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,656
Nein.

480
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:09,131
Do you know that
<i>YOU</i> are saved?

481
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:18,799
Yes...l have always...yes.

482
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,138
Nein.

483
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,577
You hesitate.

484
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,305
You must not hesitate.

485
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,382
You must be certain.

486
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:28,043
When the Holy Spirit of
God is in your heart,

487
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:31,417
your heart is filled
with joy, and you know.

488
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:38,628
Yes, but how do you do that?

489
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,063
You must open your
heart, Herr Wesley.

490
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,827
You must open your
heart to the Savior.

491
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:56,336
Mr. Wesley.

492
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:57,414
<i>(John) Miss Sophie!</i>

493
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:58,573
Hello.

494
00:31:58,683 --> 00:31:59,377
<i>(John) Hello</i>.

495
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:00,644
Will you walk with me?

496
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,379
Yes, yes of course!

497
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:06,821
My cousin wishes me to
join her in Fort Frederica.

498
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,758
Well what will l
do without you?

499
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:13,854
l must confess, l have become
quite attached to your presence.

500
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:20,131
l shall write to you daily
and think of you hourly.

501
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,297
You are a dear,
sweet girl, Miss Sophie,

502
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:25,069
but you must spend your time
in contemplation of our Savior.

503
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:27,167
Oh! l will.

504
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,870
l promise you l will.

505
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,317
Well in that case l look
forward to your letters.

506
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:34,442
And, l yours.

507
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:42,658
Good day.

508
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:48,660
Are you ready?

509
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:54,061
What is it?

510
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:56,163
lt appears that my brother has
not made an auspicious beginning

511
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:57,263
at Frederica.

512
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,615
As there is no Church,

513
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,775
l have been
conducting the services

514
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:08,112
underneath a live oak tree.

515
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:10,687
...and in the world to
come life everlasting.

516
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,221
Amen.

517
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:16,191
The grace of our Lord Jesus
CHrist and the love of God...

518
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:17,454
[gunshot]

519
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:27,397
The grace of our
Lord Jesus Christ,

520
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:31,271
and the love of God, and the
fellowship of the Holy Ghost,

521
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:34,209
be with us all evermore.

522
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:35,142
Amen.

523
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,547
Mr. Davison.

524
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,692
ls not hunting and sporting
expressly forbidden

525
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,027
on the Lord's Day?

526
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,398
Aye, sir, that it is.

527
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,869
Well then, l believe
that it is your duty

528
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:04,999
to find out who fired that
shot and have him arrested.

529
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:08,977
We shall have no desecration
of the Lord's Day.

530
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,843
<i>(Hawkins) But l have</i>
<i>sick to attend to!</i>

531
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:12,677
<i>Mrs Lawley is already</i>
<i>starting the pains,</i>

532
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,046
<i>and may deliver at any</i> mo<i>ment!</i>

533
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:18,646
Mr. Wesley said we must have
strict adherence to the rules.

534
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:20,849
You tell that self-righteous
pimple of a preacher

535
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:25,019
that he's responsible
for my patients now!

536
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:26,926
The babywas stillborn.

537
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:30,000
The people seem to blame
Charles for his death.

538
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,659
How dreadful for him.

539
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:32,963
Yes.

540
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,074
He says that few people
will attend prayers any more.

541
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:55,588
Mr. Causton sir,
l thought perhaps,

542
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:57,752
l could accompany
Miss Sophie to Frederica.

543
00:34:57,862 --> 00:35:00,456
l could see to my
brotherwhile there.

544
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:03,193
Absolutely not.

545
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,235
You have your duties
here to attend to.

546
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:08,464
l'll not allow
you to shirk them.

547
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:11,440
As for my niece,

548
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:14,875
Mr. Williamson has kindly
agreed to serve as her escort.

549
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:19,442
l did not like him.

550
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,450
Not at all.

551
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:24,020
l wonderthat Mr. Causton
thinks so highly of him,

552
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,487
to entrust Miss Sophie
to his care.

553
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,596
ls something the matter?

554
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:41,137
lt's the school.

555
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,868
Several of the children are
too poorto afford shoes,

556
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:48,707
the other children
tease them mercilessly.

557
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:52,044
l've tried everything l can
think of to make them stop;

558
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:57,383
reason, punishment,
they still persist.

559
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:12,926
l wonder, would you take
my appointments tomorrow,

560
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:15,597
and allow me to
teach the school?

561
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:18,072
Yes, of course.

562
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,009
Good. l think l have an idea.

563
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:32,048
No-shoes, no-shoes, no-shoes!

564
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,101
Well!

565
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,935
lt is true that l
have no shoes,

566
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,532
but l find it extraordinarily
rude and unchristian

567
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:54,008
that you would comment on it.

568
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:00,550
Shall we go on to
our lessons then.

569
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,157
Welcome home, Mr. Wesley.

570
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:15,964
Are you the holy bigot
that reported our bit of rum?

571
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:19,731
Yes.

572
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:22,328
Spirituous liquors are
forbidden in Georgia.

573
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,877
All we did was bring a cask off
the ship for an evening of fun.

574
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:28,411
But you knew
it to be illegal.

575
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:30,480
Ain't no harm
in a bit of rum.

576
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,607
As l recall, Mr. Harker, one of
the reasons you were in prison

577
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,310
was your love for gin.

578
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,250
lt is hard enough in this
wilderness to make ourway,

579
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,755
without drunkenness
adding to the burden.

580
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:42,621
Ezekiel Harris
got twelve lashes.

581
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,627
His back is like a
piece of raw meat,

582
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,560
thanks to you.

583
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,791
l didn't like you in
Oxford Mr. Wesley

584
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,799
and l like you
even less here.

585
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:54,530
You stay out of my way
and out of my business.

586
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:09,015
l shall do exactly as my
conscience bids me to do.

587
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,923
Mr. Wesley.

588
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:18,222
Aletter from Frederica.

589
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,907
Come.

590
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:32,635
Mr. Causton.

591
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:35,007
l must insist that you allow
me to travel to Frederica.

592
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:38,912
My brother is very ill and there
is concern he may not survive.

593
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,244
Very well.

594
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:43,286
Mr. Williamson, arrange
for a guide, straight away.

595
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:43,944
Thank you, sir.

596
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,113
l appreciate your assistance.

597
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:48,885
Mr. Wesley, l have
a request of you.

598
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,689
lt seems my niece is
anxious to return to Savannah.

599
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,060
Will you see to
her safe return?

600
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,564
Yes, of course, sir.

601
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,633
Thank you again.

602
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:23,518
<i>(John) Thank you so much</i>
<i>for your hospitality</i>.

603
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,322
How do you come
to be here, Cicero,

604
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:30,696
in the middle of
the Georgia swamps?

605
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:32,462
Well l, l runs away,

606
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:36,336
and now l'm a free man.

607
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,931
No slavery is
allowed here in Georgia.

608
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,510
Are you not afraid
here by all yourself?

609
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:41,669
No sir. No sir.

610
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:42,643
l am happy.

611
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,044
Mighty happy.

612
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:48,142
Sorry sir.

613
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:58,217
Dear Lord, thank you for all
this bounty and all myfish.

614
00:39:58,329 --> 00:39:59,193
Amen.

615
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,663
l am surprised that
you know God.

616
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:06,361
He is my friend.

617
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,768
Yourfriend?

618
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:10,534
How do you know him
without any instruction?

619
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,268
Who is here to teach you?

620
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:14,901
He's in my heart and
that is all l need.

621
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:35,624
Charlie.

622
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,963
Oh Jackie.

623
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:39,626
Thank God you've come.

624
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:43,503
l thank God you
are still alive.

625
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,505
l've brought some
physick for you.

626
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:56,876
This should really
help clear things up.

627
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:57,976
lt's straight out of my garden.

628
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,125
Here, take this.

629
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:19,735
lt must be efficacious,
it tastes terrible.

630
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:26,045
This is all your fault.

631
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,744
You brought me
here against my will,

632
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:32,584
and it has been farworse

633
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:36,922
than anything l could
have envisioned.

634
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:39,257
lt was God's will Charles.

635
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:42,059
You double-dyed hypocrite!

636
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,600
lt had nothing to do with the
will of God and you know it.

637
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,602
lt's your will,
your driving will,

638
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:53,041
it's always yourwill.

639
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:53,973
You always know what to do

640
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:56,012
and what everyone else
should do as well.

641
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:02,608
<i>(Oglethorpe) Well</i>.

642
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,711
<i>l'm glad to see you're finally</i>
<i>feeling better Mr. Wesley,</i>

643
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:08,417
but there are other issues.

644
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,120
You have managed to
alienate most of the residents.

645
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:14,823
Your service as secretary
has been marginal at best.

646
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:17,730
The situation cannot continue.

647
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,826
l have decided that you
must return to England,

648
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:23,930
and the Trustees must appoint
anotherto fill your place.

649
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:27,704
Now, l have no wish to cause
you embarrassment or shame.

650
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:29,676
l have some important letters
that must be delivered

651
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:33,739
to the Trustees, and so l shall
appoint you to carry them.

652
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:37,287
Thus there shall be no blot on
your record or on your name.

653
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,751
Thank you, sir.

654
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:47,422
l shall dispatch the
letters with haste.

655
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:48,498
<i>(Oglethorpe)</i>
<i>You are dismissed</i>.

656
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:58,039
l'll write you from Boston
before we leave for home.

657
00:42:58,142 --> 00:42:59,131
Give my love to Mother!

658
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,039
Mind those women,
brother.

659
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,767
Every time l tried to sit down
and pray or study the scripture,

660
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,706
l found myself longing for you.

661
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,005
For your guidance.

662
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,875
You are the rock
upon which l depend.

663
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,254
As much as l'd like to stay,

664
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:46,346
l think it's time we
head back to Savannah.

665
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:08,710
Mr. Wesle<i>y?</i>.

666
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,473
Will you not lie closer?

667
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:11,605
l'm very much afraid.

668
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:18,186
Yes, of course.

669
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:30,426
Heavenly father, we
ask you for strength,

670
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:35,369
and for guidance.

671
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:38,964
Keep us from temptation.

672
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:43,035
ln your Son's name, amen.

673
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:47,876
Mr. Wesley's back!

674
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:49,036
Mr. Wesley!

675
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:53,014
Mr. Wesley!

676
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:54,049
Have you been
doing your lessons?

677
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:55,345
Yes.

678
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:24,942
You'll never believe
what happened today.

679
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:26,982
Excuse me.

680
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,073
So sorry.

681
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:29,015
No. No.

682
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,950
lt's quite all right,
quite all right.

683
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:32,112
Please.

684
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:49,535
<i>(John) So, what is it</i>
<i>we're not to believe?</i>

685
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,440
Your little trick with
the shoes has paid off.

686
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:56,240
The teasing has stopped, and
some of the wealthier children

687
00:46:56,346 --> 00:47:00,043
even came in today
barefoot themselves!

688
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:03,176
l am very pleased
to hearthat.

689
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:05,915
l should see to my aunt.

690
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:07,149
Will you excuse me?

691
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:08,485
Yes, l'll walk you out.

692
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:09,320
Please.

693
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:33,643
l am wondering about
your intentions.

694
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,310
Yes?

695
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,217
Your intentions
with Miss Hopkey.

696
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:43,487
She is kind, gentle
in spirit, serene.

697
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,357
People expect you to marry.

698
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:47,623
Marry?

699
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:51,223
But l have a vow!

700
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:52,700
ln name only it seems.

701
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:05,212
She is smitten with him.

702
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:08,409
He is a favorite
of Oglethorpe's.

703
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:10,713
lt could be to
our advantage.

704
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:13,187
And to hers.

705
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,815
Ah, Mr. Wesley!

706
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:16,790
Aword.

707
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:26,459
Everything you see there
is mine, Mr. Wesley.

708
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,767
Over 500 acres.

709
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:32,774
<i>(John) l know you have</i>
<i>done quite well, sir</i>.

710
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:34,434
But what you may not know

711
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:38,446
is that my niece is
herself quite well off.

712
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:42,484
She inherited a considerable
amount from my brother,

713
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,885
a sum which l manage.

714
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:47,786
l see sir.

715
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:53,454
That girl will not be
easy until she is married.

716
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:58,591
But there are few here you
would consider a fit match.

717
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:00,670
You miss my meaning.

718
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,671
We have plenty.

719
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:08,473
All l require is that he
be an honest, good man.

720
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:11,604
He need not have a
penny to his name.

721
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:16,175
l can supply him
with a maintenance.

722
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:19,915
l'm not quite sure
what you're saying sir.

723
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:23,117
l believe my niece is in
love with you, Mr. Wesley.

724
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:24,158
Mr. Causton.

725
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:29,494
Her aunt finds you to
be a most worthy man.

726
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,159
l give her up to you.

727
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:33,827
Do with herwhat you will.

728
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:35,666
Take her into your own hands,

729
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:41,233
promise herwhat you will
and l will make it good.

730
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:45,111
l cannot speak
plainer than that.

731
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:56,858
And what would
the consequence be

732
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,521
if you do not break
off the relationship?

733
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:03,224
Why, l fear l
would marry her!

734
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,200
l don't see why
you should not!

735
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:09,170
Herr Wesley, l do not understand
where you have this idea

736
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:10,864
not to marry.

737
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:11,941
This is not to my knowledge

738
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:13,873
a requirement of the
Church of England?

739
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:16,377
No, no, it is my own pledge.

740
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,380
Ah. Your own pledge.

741
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:25,612
Herr Wesley, we try
diligently first to ascertain

742
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:27,383
what is the will of God,

743
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:33,259
and then to do what we must
to fulfill that, to obey.

744
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:37,959
lt seems to me that more often
you decide what you will do,

745
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:41,868
and you seek to
impose that on God.

746
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:43,803
You see, Herr Wesley,
we nearly always marry

747
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:46,034
before going into
the mission field.

748
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,577
The man and the woman
are together in service.

749
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:51,272
l don't know what l should
do without my dear Catherina.

750
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,040
Ja, ja.

751
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:56,176
You see, marriage
is ordained by God.

752
00:50:56,286 --> 00:50:58,811
The Scriptures say
that if you burn,

753
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:01,049
then you should marry.

754
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:03,626
l think all of this is a sign
that you should marry.

755
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:08,624
l don't think you understand...

756
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:13,063
Hmm.

757
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,660
l think l understand very well.

758
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:26,606
l have something l
want to ask of you.

759
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:33,280
l want you to pray to God
that l am doing what He wants.

760
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:37,258
l have decided l
must keep my vow.

761
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,453
l shall inform
Miss Sophie immediately.

762
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:33,444
No. No!

763
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:37,384
l cannot take fire into my
heart and not be burned by it.

764
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:43,016
But that is the
nature of love, is it not?

765
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:47,392
What has come over you?

766
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,226
l will not betray God.

767
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,993
l have not asked you to.

768
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:11,051
Look at me.

769
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:16,214
You are the dearest
of girls to me.

770
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:25,559
And if l should ever marry,

771
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:28,160
my hope is that it
would be to you.

772
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:33,868
Tell me plain, John, do
you desire to marry me?

773
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:38,937
Can l hope be yourwife?

774
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,574
l must first honor my
commitments to God.

775
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:44,483
When l have succeeded with
my mission to the lndians -

776
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:48,251
And when will that be?

777
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:51,191
l don't know.

778
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:53,387
Oh. l see.

779
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:07,570
[speaking in French]

780
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:16,142
And l won't be having
breakfast with you any longer.

781
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:19,017
People wonderwhat
l might be doing

782
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:24,219
at your home for so long.

783
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:25,817
Let them wonder no more.

784
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:36,898
Did l do the right thing?

785
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:46,307
How does one know if they're
doing God's will or their own?

786
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:58,617
When Causton showed me
that beautiful knoll,

787
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:03,563
all that could be mine,

788
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:06,864
l saw my life unfold before
me there on that hill.

789
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:12,875
Miss Sophie by my side,
our sweet children playing.

790
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:21,309
And l was a fat and
comfortable old man.

791
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,520
ls that what God wants of me?

792
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:41,233
Mr. Wesley.

793
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,465
Mrs. Causton.

794
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:45,336
Thank you so much
for coming.

795
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:47,137
Please be seated.

796
00:55:58,221 --> 00:56:00,781
Mr. Causton and l are
exceedingly obliged

797
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:03,620
for all you've done
for our Sophie.

798
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:05,627
l have done so little.

799
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:07,196
Nonsense.

800
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:10,289
You've done a great deal.

801
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,269
And now we have one
more thing to ask of you.

802
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,068
Will you marry her...

803
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:20,904
To Mr. Williamson?

804
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:22,272
To Mr. Williamson?

805
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,846
Yes.

806
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:26,814
Mr. Williamson has asked
Mr. Causton's permission,

807
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:29,749
and he has given it...

808
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:34,415
Unless you'll have
something to say against it?

809
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:35,582
lt's not too late.

810
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:42,362
<i>(John) Miss Sophie!</i>

811
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:43,693
Mr. Wesley!

812
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:49,762
Your aunt tells
me that you are...

813
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,265
Engaged.

814
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:56,470
Yes, to Mr. Williamson.

815
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,308
He proposed last night
and l accepted,

816
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,906
provided you have
nothing to say?

817
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:05,846
<i>(John) But l don't see how you</i>
<i>can be devoted to both God</i>

818
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:07,718
<i>and wife</i>.

819
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:10,725
<i>There's simply not room</i>
<i>in my heart for both</i>.

820
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:12,692
<i>But l have a vow!</i>

821
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:07,641
Though l speak with the
tongues of men and of angels

822
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:13,313
and have not love, l am
become a sounding brass,

823
00:58:13,423 --> 00:58:16,551
a tinkling cymbal.

824
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,854
And though l have
the gift of prophecy,

825
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:21,590
and understand all
mysteries and all knowledge,

826
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:25,566
and though l have all
faith so as to move mountains,

827
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:33,131
and have not love,
l am nothing.

828
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:36,770
And... and though l give all
my goods to feed the poor,

829
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,680
and delivereth my
body to be burned,

830
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:44,719
and have not love,
it profiteth me nothing.

831
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:11,870
Miss Sophie!
Miss Sophie!

832
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:15,178
Mrs. Williamson,
if you please.

833
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:16,684
Your eye!

834
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:19,220
l ran into a door.

835
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:20,016
Adoor?

836
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:21,522
Yes, it was dark.

837
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:28,727
Well, you really should put
a piece of beefsteak on it,

838
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:29,559
it is a proven cure.

839
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:34,399
Thank you.

840
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:36,665
Do you have something
to say, sir?

841
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:43,335
Yes.

842
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:47,348
lt's about your
absences at communion.

843
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:48,246
lt is a most serious matter,

844
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,943
neglecting your religious
duty in that manner.

845
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:53,716
<i>(Miss Sophie) l have been busy</i>.

846
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:54,653
lt has gone on so long

847
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:57,521
that l must require that
you meet with me privately

848
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:58,958
before you may take
communion again,

849
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:04,728
so that l am assured of
your genuine repentance.

850
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:07,735
My repentance?

851
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:11,568
<i>(John) Yes, it's required</i>
<i>by Church law</i>.

852
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:14,142
Thank you Mr. Wesley.

853
01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:17,440
l shall take yourwords
under careful advisement.

854
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:23,982
Good day, Mrs. Williamson.

855
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:25,179
Good day.

856
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:29,590
The body and blood of Christ.

857
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,630
The body and blood of--

858
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:40,058
Mrs. Williamson, l told you that
you must speak to me privately

859
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:42,899
before you could
partake of the Eucharist again.

860
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:45,270
l must refuse you.

861
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:46,569
Fine!

862
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:47,938
We'll just see
who'll be repentant,

863
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:50,103
Mr. John Wesley!

864
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:51,305
Excuse me.

865
01:00:58,187 --> 01:01:00,883
Constable Harris, good morning!

866
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:04,721
l'm sorry, Mr. Wesley, but l
must place you under arrest.

867
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,226
Under arrest?

868
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:06,954
For what?

869
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:07,961
Yes.

870
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:10,828
Mr. Williamson is suing you for
defamation of the character

871
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:12,264
of his wife.

872
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:14,836
l'm sorry, sir, you'll
have to come with me.

873
01:01:14,937 --> 01:01:15,961
Defamation.

874
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:24,711
Mr. Williamson, what are
the damages sought?

875
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:27,305
Athousand pounds sterling.

876
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:28,543
Why, it's a king's ransom!

877
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:30,846
Mr. Wesley only earns
twenty- eight pounds a year.

878
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:32,853
He could never afford it.

879
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:37,915
Mr. Wesley, what say you?

880
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:41,690
That this court has no powerto
interrogate me on these matters.

881
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:46,201
Every part of the incident
concerns ecclesiastical law.

882
01:01:46,302 --> 01:01:49,863
That may be your
opinion Mr. Wesley,

883
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:53,430
but this court finds that it
does indeed have jurisdiction,

884
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:57,377
and shall proceed to trial as
soon as we can empanel a jury

885
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:01,041
to hearthe case.

886
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:02,447
Case continued.

887
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:15,623
Listen to me, you arrogant....

888
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:20,135
You have insulted me
and my entire family!

889
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:22,534
l have drawn my sword, sir,

890
01:02:22,638 --> 01:02:25,937
and l shall not sheathe it
until l have had satisfaction!

891
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:28,704
Now get out!

892
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:35,307
But make sure you are here
Tuesday next to face a jury.

893
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,010
This is getting ridiculous!

894
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,553
How much longer are we
going to go on like this?

895
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:41,179
Seven trial sessions,
and not a bit of progress!

896
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:43,053
Please listen to me.

897
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:46,356
Herr Causton is out to ruin you.

898
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:49,090
He and his wife are doing
everything they can

899
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:51,257
to turn the people against you.

900
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:53,699
He waits until the jurors
are sufficiently coached

901
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:54,861
in their hatred.

902
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:56,563
<i>(Dela</i>mo<i>tte) John, he's right</i>.

903
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:57,832
<i>You know that</i>.

904
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,703
l'll not sneak away
like a guilty coward!

905
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:00,639
l'll not do it.

906
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:03,610
But you can't stay here and
be convicted unfairly.

907
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:06,614
As much as it
pains me to say it,

908
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:09,549
l think you must
return to England.

909
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:11,586
Your ministry here has ended.

910
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:23,260
You should put him in jail.

911
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:25,596
l can't, unless he actually
leaves the jurisdiction.

912
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:27,862
He's the apple of
Oglethorpe's eye.

913
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:31,064
l'm flirting with
trouble as it is.

914
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:32,072
Then l know how to handle it.

915
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:52,294
Yes, l'll pay a gold sovereign

916
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:55,626
to anyone who catches
Mr. Wesley leaving Savannah!

917
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:56,595
Cor!

918
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:57,791
Asovereign!

919
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,736
l came to bring
Christ to the lndians!

920
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:10,034
And what have l accomplished?

921
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:16,778
That l didn't even know
myself what salvation is!

922
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:22,756
They're still out there,
just like every other night.

923
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:26,192
Harker has the best view.

924
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:28,286
He'd kill his
motherfortuppence,

925
01:04:28,397 --> 01:04:29,421
much less a sovereign.

926
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:38,368
ls everything ready?

927
01:04:38,474 --> 01:04:39,805
<i>(Dela</i>mo<i>tte) We're to wait</i>
<i>for Mr. Locke's signal</i>.

928
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:09,029
<i>(Harker) Where did he go?</i>

929
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:10,696
<i>(Locke) He took a dinghy</i>
<i>from the south landing</i>

930
01:05:10,806 --> 01:05:15,266
mo<i>r'n a 'aar hour ago</i>.

931
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:16,572
Ye'll no catch 'em now.

932
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:26,621
Yer all set, sir.

933
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:28,781
Ol' Jenson was
watching the rear 'ere,

934
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:31,951
but now he's sleeping
orf the rum l gave 'im.

935
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:34,359
Mr. Locke, you know that
spirituous liquors are...

936
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:37,830
Now, Mr. Wesley, don't
a-go lookin' a gift horse

937
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:40,300
in the mouth.

938
01:05:40,403 --> 01:05:44,339
Asides, it were for
medicinal purposes.

939
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:48,672
Now, Mr. Coates is
upstream by the point.

940
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,245
Okay.

941
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:53,372
Good luck, Mr. Wesley!

942
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:57,816
Mr. Locke, l thank you for
your kindness and your help.

943
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:03,213
Stay in the shadows!

944
01:06:09,565 --> 01:06:11,624
<i>(John) They followed our</i>
<i>decoy downssteam</i>

945
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:13,793
<i>whilst l made my way upssteam</i>

946
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:16,804
<i>and crossed the mud flats</i>
<i>to get to Port Royal</i>

947
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:20,672
<i>where l obtained passage on the</i>
<i>HMS Samuel with Captain Percy</i>.

948
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:29,348
Gentlemen, l have brought
discredit on the cloth.

949
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:33,218
And on you.

950
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:37,122
And forthat you have
my deepest apology.

951
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:41,162
That is not the opinion of
the Trustees, Mr. Wesley.

952
01:06:41,263 --> 01:06:44,630
Looking overthe reports we have
for yourtwo years in Georgia,

953
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:47,202
we see that the church
was better attended,

954
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:49,498
and according to our inspectors,

955
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:51,630
the working people have
taken a more energetic role

956
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:54,266
in the life of the settlement.

957
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:56,811
We do not feel you
have failed at all.

958
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:59,574
We feel you have
ably prepared the way,

959
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:02,412
and your successorwill be able
to make even greater progress.

960
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,679
My successor?

961
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:07,187
Who shall that be, sir?

962
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:09,120
Mr. Whitefield.

963
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:10,317
Mr. George Whitefield?

964
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:11,552
Even so.

965
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:14,652
He's on his way this
very moment to Savannah.

966
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:19,895
With his very, entertaining
and popular style,

967
01:07:20,002 --> 01:07:22,664
he will be able to build upon
the legacy that you have begun.

968
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:29,271
We congratulate you,
Mr. Wesley

969
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:31,608
and we thank you
for your service.

970
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:32,806
Thank you.

971
01:07:32,915 --> 01:07:34,746
What will you do
now, Mr. Wesley?

972
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:42,619
l don't know.

973
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:08,349
Mr. Bray is a
compassionate landlord.

974
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:10,749
He has charged me to see
to your brother's comfort.

975
01:08:10,853 --> 01:08:13,879
Wait a moment, his comfort?

976
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:16,480
He has been quite ill.

977
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:17,183
No need to worry.

978
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:18,157
He is in good hands.

979
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:28,896
Jackie!

980
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:37,579
Oh, heavens,
you are burning up.

981
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:38,305
lt's nothing.

982
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:39,039
l'm better.

983
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:40,308
Not so much.

984
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:42,077
You need to rest.

985
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:43,617
Are you Herr Wesley?

986
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:45,744
l am Peter.

987
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:47,914
My brothers in Savannah
speak highly of you.

988
01:08:48,023 --> 01:08:49,752
They were most kind to me.

989
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:52,589
l shall miss their guidance.

990
01:08:52,695 --> 01:08:54,219
Jackie!

991
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:58,266
l am so very, very
happy you are home.

992
01:09:03,038 --> 01:09:05,939
How long has he been like this?

993
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:09,738
Perhaps you have
some more of that...

994
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:16,410
He is betterthan he
was two weeks ago.

995
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:19,545
His body will heal with
time and God's blessing.

996
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:23,091
l have no concern
for his spirit.

997
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:27,652
The Holy Spirit
truly resides in him.

998
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:29,788
Brother Boehler,
may l speak with you?

999
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:31,696
l simply feel that my
affections for her

1000
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,166
were taking away from
my focus on....

1001
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:37,034
This woman was not the problem.

1002
01:09:37,139 --> 01:09:40,131
lt is your heart
that is the problem.

1003
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:42,642
You are confused.

1004
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:46,943
Yes. l am.

1005
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:53,215
To be honest Brother Boehler,
lately l've been feeling

1006
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:57,554
more and more that
my faith is a lie.

1007
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:02,120
Do you know in your
heart that you are saved?

1008
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:05,132
That is the very question
Mr. Spangenburg asked me,

1009
01:10:05,234 --> 01:10:08,169
and l told him yes.

1010
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:10,500
But l lied.

1011
01:10:10,606 --> 01:10:14,565
You must not lie to yourself.

1012
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:20,206
Tonight, everything has
come to this one moment,

1013
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:22,546
everything has led you here,

1014
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:27,020
to realize that you
cannot earn salvation.

1015
01:10:27,122 --> 01:10:28,749
Yes, but everything
l have learned,

1016
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:30,415
everything that l
have been taught,

1017
01:10:30,526 --> 01:10:34,189
is that by good works and proper
living one shall attain heaven.

1018
01:10:34,296 --> 01:10:37,891
Where is that in the Bible?

1019
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,468
lf you, by your goodness,
shall be saved,

1020
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:44,300
why did Christ die?

1021
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:48,740
Tonight the Saviour offers you
everything you have sought for

1022
01:10:48,844 --> 01:10:55,044
so long, as a free gift,
if you will but take it!

1023
01:10:55,150 --> 01:11:02,989
When you do, you will know
what we call Heart Religion.

1024
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:06,118
l don't know what l
believe any more.

1025
01:11:06,228 --> 01:11:10,062
l just feel so -- pulled -- in
so many different directions.

1026
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:14,625
Come with me tonight,
we have a meeting.

1027
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:16,830
Mr. Bray will be there.

1028
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:24,345
My grace is
sufficient for thee:

1029
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:36,847
for my strength is made
perfect in weakness.

1030
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:45,697
This here is true, for l was
as weak as any God ever made.

1031
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:49,498
So often l used to
gamble away my money

1032
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:52,870
while the kiddies
had naught to eat.

1033
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:58,413
ln my cups,
l used to beat my dearwife.

1034
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:05,113
But the gracious Lord has saved
me with his wonderful grace.

1035
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:12,388
And now, today,
my heart is at peace.

1036
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:15,520
How can it be
that a man like that,

1037
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:17,861
who has led a life of sin,

1038
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:21,231
can be in such peace while
l am in such turmoil?

1039
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:26,104
Are you not a sinner, too?

1040
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:28,267
Oh, l hope you're not
comparing me with him...

1041
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:32,442
Yes, Peter.

1042
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:35,574
l am just as much
a sinner as he.

1043
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:40,087
But you speak of this
instantaneous conversion that...

1044
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:43,716
l cannot accept that a man
can just be instantly saved,

1045
01:12:43,826 --> 01:12:44,724
someone like that,

1046
01:12:44,827 --> 01:12:48,695
where someone who has lived a
righteous and careful life --

1047
01:12:48,797 --> 01:12:51,357
John!

1048
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:54,493
Do you hope to be saved?

1049
01:12:54,603 --> 01:12:57,128
Yes, of course!

1050
01:12:57,239 --> 01:13:01,938
Why do you hope it?

1051
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:05,036
Because l have used my
best endeavors to serve God.

1052
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:06,205
You, see, you see.

1053
01:13:06,315 --> 01:13:08,283
Again, yourwill.

1054
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:12,013
Yourworks.

1055
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:16,182
My brother, this
philosophy of yours,

1056
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:18,885
it must be entirely
purged away.

1057
01:13:21,797 --> 01:13:23,059
l have been looking
through the Scriptures

1058
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:28,501
for instances of conversion,
and indeed Peter is right.

1059
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:30,572
Every one an instantaneous
transformation,

1060
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:33,732
not because of deeds
but because of Grace.

1061
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:38,006
That is what we have been
trying to tell you, John.

1062
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:39,978
Look at you Charlie!

1063
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:43,540
You're so content, so
at peace with the world.

1064
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:45,586
l feel that no matter
how hard l look,

1065
01:13:45,687 --> 01:13:49,316
l'm never going to find
such comfort.

1066
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,756
John.

1067
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:53,089
Perhaps you should
return to Epworth.

1068
01:13:53,195 --> 01:13:54,457
Mother would be most happy.

1069
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:55,825
That's out of the question.

1070
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:00,490
What?

1071
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:01,660
No, nothing.

1072
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:12,573
l have good news
from Savannah.

1073
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:15,081
You have been acquitted!

1074
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:19,518
lt seems Mr. Causton has been
removed from his post as well.

1075
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:21,145
He had some issues
with his accounting,

1076
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:22,314
among other things.

1077
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:27,622
Are you not pleased?

1078
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:35,700
lt doesn't really
solve my problem -- me.

1079
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:43,305
l've been thinking l
should stop preaching.

1080
01:14:43,412 --> 01:14:47,212
But why would you do that?

1081
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:51,412
How can l preach to others
something l don't have myself?

1082
01:14:56,792 --> 01:15:00,626
My brother, do not
stop preaching.

1083
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:05,063
Preach faith
until you have faith.

1084
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:08,034
Then you will preach
faith because you have faith.

1085
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:24,316
For all have sinned and fallen
short of the glory of God.

1086
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:43,134
How often have we heard
that comment from Paul

1087
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:47,607
and ignored its true meaning?

1088
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:50,940
Awoman dead drunk on gin we
might hold to be worthless.

1089
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:59,516
But l am of no more worth.

1090
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:02,988
And neither are you!

1091
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:09,257
We have all sinned and fallen
short of the glory of God.

1092
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:13,994
But at least a woman who is dead
drunk on gin is not a hypocrite.

1093
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:15,034
Mr. Wesley...

1094
01:16:15,137 --> 01:16:20,097
lf l may, please, it is my
belief that your parishioners,

1095
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:22,938
and in fact the majority of the
parishioners all across England

1096
01:16:23,045 --> 01:16:24,034
have been coddled into thinking

1097
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:25,204
they may believe whatever
Scriptures they like...

1098
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:27,680
Mr. Wesley, no matter
what our friendship of old,

1099
01:16:27,783 --> 01:16:30,343
what you said in
there was inexcusable.

1100
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:33,319
l'm sorry, John.

1101
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:36,448
You are no longer
welcome in my pulpit.

1102
01:16:36,558 --> 01:16:37,490
Mr. White.

1103
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:38,787
Mr. White!

1104
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:48,431
l trust that your
missionary work in Georgia

1105
01:16:48,537 --> 01:16:50,732
will be more
blessed than mine.

1106
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:53,942
As do l!

1107
01:17:01,249 --> 01:17:02,648
My ship is waiting.

1108
01:17:05,854 --> 01:17:07,082
Thank you for everything, Peter.

1109
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:08,952
Godspeed.

1110
01:17:09,057 --> 01:17:10,024
And with you Herr Wesley.

1111
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:17,629
John!

1112
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:24,933
ln here.

1113
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:41,421
Jackie!

1114
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:42,581
Did you see Peter off?

1115
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:44,215
l did indeed.

1116
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:45,850
And l trust that his
experience in Georgia

1117
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:47,792
will be more blessed than mine.

1118
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:50,421
And mine!

1119
01:17:50,532 --> 01:17:54,764
John, l must tell you.

1120
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:57,566
l've written a poem, a hymn.

1121
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:58,332
l'll read it for you.

1122
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:06,943
Where shall my
wand'ring soul begin,

1123
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:11,042
How shall l to
heaven aspire?

1124
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:14,145
Aslave redeemed
from death and sin,

1125
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:18,693
a brand plucked
from eternal fire...

1126
01:18:18,794 --> 01:18:20,352
Let me make you some
tar-waterforthe cough.

1127
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:24,694
No, Jackie, l'm fine.

1128
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,166
You have a cure for everything.

1129
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:30,261
Jackie, stop!

1130
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:34,035
lt's always so that
you're in control.

1131
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:38,875
Don't you understand,
sometimes you must just rest,

1132
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:41,005
rest in the will of God?

1133
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:42,310
No!

1134
01:18:42,417 --> 01:18:46,513
No, Charles, l don't understand.

1135
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:49,146
l feel so alone.

1136
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:51,282
Peter has left, and
you're writing hymns

1137
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:56,126
about an experience
that l cannot share.

1138
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:57,721
l feel as if God
has abandoned me.

1139
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:04,701
Look at me.

1140
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:12,980
Go to the meeting
tonight with Mr. Bray.

1141
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:15,777
Open your heart.

1142
01:19:15,884 --> 01:19:18,876
Forthe first time in your
life, let yourself go.

1143
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:26,584
l don't know what
that means, Charles.

1144
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:39,702
They are hypocrites still,

1145
01:19:39,808 --> 01:19:42,743
who live virtuous lives but
without eagerness and love;

1146
01:19:42,844 --> 01:19:44,903
in their heart they are
enemies of God's law

1147
01:19:45,013 --> 01:19:47,277
and like to judge other people.

1148
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:49,441
What is he reading?

1149
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:51,018
l believe it's
Martin Luther's introduction

1150
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:52,780
to the Book of Romans.

1151
01:19:52,888 --> 01:19:54,879
lt's an excellent commentary on
how we are saved through faith

1152
01:19:54,990 --> 01:20:01,589
and not...works.

1153
01:20:01,696 --> 01:20:04,221
That is why faith alone
makes someone just

1154
01:20:04,332 --> 01:20:08,325
and fulfills the law; faith it
is that brings the Holy Spirit

1155
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:10,461
through the merits of Christ.

1156
01:20:10,572 --> 01:20:13,803
The Spirit, in turn renders
the heart glad and free,

1157
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:15,877
as the law demands.

1158
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:18,878
Then good works
proceed from faith itself.

1159
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,882
You've found it?

1160
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:05,323
No!

1161
01:21:05,427 --> 01:21:09,921
lt has found me.

1162
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:12,932
My heart is
strangelywarmed!

1163
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:15,696
Oh, l have prayed
daily for you.

1164
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:23,943
Where shall my
wondering soul begin, ,

1165
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:28,982
how shall l all
to heaven aspire? ,

1166
01:21:29,084 --> 01:21:33,919
Aslave redeemed
from death and sin, ,

1167
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:38,391
Abrand plucked
from eternal fire,

1168
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:39,858
<i>(Voice) 'Ere, quiet!</i>

1169
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:47,828
How shall l equal
triumphs raise,

1170
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:50,935
<i>(Man) Quiet!</i>

1171
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:52,028
<i>(Man 2) l'm stying' to sleep!</i>

1172
01:21:56,811 --> 01:21:59,974
What is this, you say?

1173
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:03,244
Mercyfor all?

1174
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:07,219
Yes, yes, that is the truth!

1175
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:11,156
Mercy for Zacheaus,
a public robber!

1176
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:14,717
Mercy for Mary Magdalene,
a common harlot!

1177
01:22:14,829 --> 01:22:21,166
Then l hear you say,
you sinner, and you,

1178
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:25,899
''Why, perhaps maybe
there is even mercyfor me!''

1179
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:30,967
Don't ever darken the
door of this church again!

1180
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:32,273
<i>(Man) l'll speak</i>
<i>to the Archbishop!</i>

1181
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:33,642
<i>The man should be defrocked</i>...

1182
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:39,384
(Samuel) What is this l hear?

1183
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:41,421
That my younger brother
has been barred

1184
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:44,686
from nearly every
pulpit in London?

1185
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:46,317
Have you taken
leave of your senses?

1186
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:50,857
No, Brother,
l've just come to them.

1187
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:52,490
Rather like the
Prodigal Son, in fact.

1188
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:55,797
You have intentionally
offended some of the wealthiest

1189
01:22:55,904 --> 01:22:58,839
and most respected supporters
of church work in England.

1190
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:01,204
You don't see a
problem with that?

1191
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:02,333
lf what l said offended them,

1192
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:04,469
then perhaps they were
in need of offending.

1193
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:05,944
lt was nothing but
the truth, Samuel.

1194
01:23:06,047 --> 01:23:06,741
The truth!

1195
01:23:06,848 --> 01:23:08,509
The truth as you see it!

1196
01:23:08,616 --> 01:23:12,017
The truth as l have
it from Scripture.

1197
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,815
Jackie.

1198
01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:15,014
You say that you're
different now.

1199
01:23:15,123 --> 01:23:17,614
But l don't see the difference.

1200
01:23:17,726 --> 01:23:19,250
You've always
visited the prisons,

1201
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:21,989
you've always helped the poor.

1202
01:23:22,097 --> 01:23:25,897
Why is doing that
now so different?

1203
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:29,903
l do it for a different
reason now, Samuel.

1204
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:32,906
Before, l did good
works out of fear of Hell,

1205
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:37,445
out of desperation
to save myself.

1206
01:23:37,545 --> 01:23:39,638
No matter how
noble my deeds seemed,

1207
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:42,444
they were all for me.

1208
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:43,881
And now they're not?

1209
01:23:43,985 --> 01:23:46,215
No. No, now they're not.

1210
01:23:46,321 --> 01:23:52,726
Now l don't fear Hell--
l know that l am saved Samuel.

1211
01:23:52,827 --> 01:23:54,886
When l visit the prisons and
bring food to the hungry

1212
01:23:54,996 --> 01:23:57,965
because l understand what it
means to love thy neighbor.

1213
01:23:58,066 --> 01:24:01,866
l don't see any difference.

1214
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:04,370
The l shall pray
that one day you will.

1215
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:07,339
You and Charles have
clearly lost your minds.

1216
01:24:07,442 --> 01:24:10,104
lf you wish to act the
fool, that is your affair.

1217
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:12,236
But please don't
drag my good name

1218
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:13,746
down into the
gutterwith yours.

1219
01:24:18,186 --> 01:24:19,448
lt sounds as if your
ministry in Georgia

1220
01:24:19,554 --> 01:24:21,215
was a wonderful success.

1221
01:24:21,322 --> 01:24:24,689
Aye, but l'm making
myself useful preaching here.

1222
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:26,693
l wish l could
say the same.

1223
01:24:26,795 --> 01:24:29,025
l've been barred from
nearly every pulpit in London.

1224
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:30,654
Then you must do as l do!

1225
01:24:30,765 --> 01:24:32,733
Forget the pulpits
and the parishes!

1226
01:24:32,834 --> 01:24:35,132
There are no
churches where l preach.

1227
01:24:35,236 --> 01:24:37,761
New mines, new mills,
new manufactories,

1228
01:24:37,872 --> 01:24:40,739
all have all been built
outside the old parishes.

1229
01:24:40,842 --> 01:24:43,470
All of them are filled
with needy souls.

1230
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:45,375
The bishops will not
build them churches.

1231
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,345
They think ...

1232
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:49,781
Well, you know what they think.

1233
01:24:49,884 --> 01:24:52,648
Yes, they are strangers,
outsiders.

1234
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:56,155
Animals, more like.

1235
01:24:56,257 --> 01:24:57,781
Yes, but it goes
against the grain,

1236
01:24:57,892 --> 01:24:59,416
to preach outside the church.

1237
01:24:59,527 --> 01:25:01,085
l have always
believed in proper order,

1238
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:02,720
in maintaining the traditions.

1239
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:03,627
Order?

1240
01:25:03,731 --> 01:25:04,698
Open your eyes, man!

1241
01:25:04,799 --> 01:25:06,426
There's no orderto it.

1242
01:25:06,534 --> 01:25:08,229
And what's wrong
with field preaching?

1243
01:25:08,336 --> 01:25:10,099
What do you think
the Lord himself did?

1244
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:11,672
He often spoke in
the synagogues.

1245
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:13,900
Afew times, John, a few times.

1246
01:25:14,008 --> 01:25:15,839
Look at the Bible!

1247
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:18,936
Where do you think he preached
the Sermon on the Mount?

1248
01:25:19,047 --> 01:25:23,074
Where did He preach before
the Loaves and the Fishes?

1249
01:25:23,184 --> 01:25:25,914
ln the fields.

1250
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:27,681
Come with me to Bristol, John!

1251
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:29,347
Come and see what l mean.

1252
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:32,051
Thousands come
to hear me preach.

1253
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:35,129
Gin shops close,
magistrates' offices empty.

1254
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:38,961
These people are
desperate forthe Gospel.

1255
01:25:39,067 --> 01:25:39,999
l need your help.

1256
01:25:43,538 --> 01:25:46,006
They need your help!

1257
01:25:46,107 --> 01:25:50,476
Do you know why so many
congregations are dead?

1258
01:25:50,578 --> 01:25:55,345
Because they have dead
men preaching to them!

1259
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:58,681
Today, my brothers
and sisters in the Lord,

1260
01:25:58,786 --> 01:26:02,813
John Wesley, a man
whose heart is alive,

1261
01:26:02,924 --> 01:26:03,982
shall preach to you!

1262
01:26:06,928 --> 01:26:07,826
Thank you.

1263
01:26:16,771 --> 01:26:19,205
Good morning.

1264
01:26:19,307 --> 01:26:22,242
How a sinner may be
justified before God,

1265
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:25,107
the Lord and Judge of all.

1266
01:26:25,213 --> 01:26:28,649
You must look to Jesus!

1267
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:30,945
There is the Lamb of God,
who takes away your sins.

1268
01:26:36,724 --> 01:26:40,785
And you who feel
just as fit for hell,

1269
01:26:40,895 --> 01:26:42,829
are just as fit
to advance his glory;

1270
01:26:42,931 --> 01:26:46,094
the glory of his free grace.

1271
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:47,930
Come quickly!

1272
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:50,937
Believe in the Lord Jesus;

1273
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:55,100
and thou, even thou,
art reconciled to God.

1274
01:26:59,981 --> 01:27:01,812
Now, who shall open their
hearts to the Lord today?

1275
01:27:18,933 --> 01:27:20,298
Well?

1276
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:21,265
What did l tell you?

1277
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:32,603
John!

1278
01:27:32,714 --> 01:27:33,874
Have you lost your mind?!

1279
01:27:33,982 --> 01:27:34,778
Just a few repairs,

1280
01:27:34,882 --> 01:27:37,476
and we can have the
printing press overthere,

1281
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:40,019
the chapel over here!

1282
01:27:40,121 --> 01:27:41,645
Areal place for us
to work and live.

1283
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:43,121
And a home for Mother.

1284
01:27:43,224 --> 01:27:44,054
Ahome for Mother?

1285
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:45,887
Here?

1286
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:46,790
Yes, trust me!

1287
01:28:32,707 --> 01:28:39,738
<i>That thou my God</i>
<i>should'st die for me</i>.

1288
01:28:39,847 --> 01:28:47,618
<i>Amazing Love,</i>
<i>how can it be,</i>

1289
01:28:47,722 --> 01:28:57,495
<i>that thou my God</i>
<i>should'st die for me</i>.

1290
01:28:57,598 --> 01:29:02,262
Hear what comfortable words our
Saviour Christ saith unto all

1291
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:05,965
who truly turn unto him.

1292
01:29:06,074 --> 01:29:09,271
''Come unto me all
that travail...

1293
01:29:09,377 --> 01:29:18,285
and-- and l will refresh you.''

1294
01:29:18,386 --> 01:29:20,081
You should
have seen them.

1295
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:22,816
An entire pew of
filthy beggars.

1296
01:29:22,924 --> 01:29:26,052
They are all Christians now,
and that is their parish church.

1297
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:30,790
Nevertheless, Mr. Wesley,
you will not bring them again.

1298
01:29:30,898 --> 01:29:33,298
And why not?

1299
01:29:33,401 --> 01:29:35,369
Because l've commanded it.

1300
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:36,459
You are interfering
with the governance

1301
01:29:36,571 --> 01:29:40,029
of one of my parishes, bringing
offense to the good worshippers

1302
01:29:40,141 --> 01:29:43,872
by bringing these...
strangers among us.

1303
01:29:43,978 --> 01:29:44,842
l would ask however,

1304
01:29:44,946 --> 01:29:48,507
why you believe you have
the right to interfere so?

1305
01:29:48,616 --> 01:29:49,776
l believe it is God's will

1306
01:29:49,884 --> 01:29:51,715
that l should revive the
Church of England.

1307
01:29:51,819 --> 01:29:52,877
You believe it's God's will!

1308
01:29:52,987 --> 01:29:55,217
What if l believe it isn't?

1309
01:29:55,323 --> 01:29:57,120
Pretending
extraordinary revelations

1310
01:29:57,225 --> 01:30:01,685
and gifts of the Holy Spirit
is a horrid thing!

1311
01:30:01,796 --> 01:30:05,027
Avery horrid thing!

1312
01:30:05,133 --> 01:30:09,570
You have no license but to
preach in your own parish.

1313
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:11,194
And since you
have no parish...

1314
01:30:11,305 --> 01:30:18,905
My Lord, l look upon the
whole world as my parish.

1315
01:30:19,013 --> 01:30:20,241
Good day.

1316
01:30:29,223 --> 01:30:30,952
Bloody Hell!

1317
01:30:31,058 --> 01:30:32,787
Dear! Language!

1318
01:30:32,894 --> 01:30:36,728
The Gentleman's Magazine says
that this upstart preacher

1319
01:30:36,831 --> 01:30:41,359
could upset the supply of coal
and push prices to the sky!

1320
01:30:41,469 --> 01:30:45,963
But what can preaching have
to do with the price of coal?

1321
01:30:46,073 --> 01:30:48,439
All the colliers go to hear
him bythe thousands.

1322
01:30:48,543 --> 01:30:49,168
They're not working.

1323
01:30:49,277 --> 01:30:51,268
He gives them
ideas above their station.

1324
01:30:51,379 --> 01:30:55,042
Here, he tells them,
these dirty, vulgar miners,

1325
01:30:55,149 --> 01:30:56,878
that they are just
as good as we are!

1326
01:30:56,984 --> 01:30:59,418
Oh! How horrid!

1327
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:05,357
Amen.

1328
01:31:08,563 --> 01:31:11,999
Mr. Furniss, how are
you feel toda<i>y?</i>.

1329
01:31:12,099 --> 01:31:14,431
Well, sir, you talk
straight with me before

1330
01:31:14,535 --> 01:31:17,527
like no one else has so
l'll talk straight back.

1331
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:22,166
Sitting here saying
prayers l feel right daft.

1332
01:31:22,276 --> 01:31:23,573
And what of your drinking?

1333
01:31:23,678 --> 01:31:25,908
Well, l stayed
off it forthree days now,

1334
01:31:26,013 --> 01:31:29,244
that's bad, eh?

1335
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:31,477
ln fact, me old wife
think it's quite a miracle.

1336
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:37,089
Morning, my lord.

1337
01:31:37,191 --> 01:31:42,652
Ah! Baker, do you recall that
arrangement we had last year

1338
01:31:42,763 --> 01:31:44,788
when a gentleman caused
trouble forthe mine?

1339
01:31:44,899 --> 01:31:46,230
l, that l do my lord.

1340
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:48,268
We took care of him
good an' proper...

1341
01:31:48,369 --> 01:31:51,600
Have you heard of
this preacher, Wesle<i>y?</i>.

1342
01:31:51,706 --> 01:31:53,173
Aye, my lord.

1343
01:31:53,274 --> 01:31:58,576
He is causing a
bit of trouble...

1344
01:31:58,679 --> 01:32:00,772
Let me know when my
troubles are over,

1345
01:32:00,882 --> 01:32:03,112
theres' a good chap.

1346
01:32:03,217 --> 01:32:03,911
Aye, my lord.

1347
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:12,516
l would like to thank you
all for your kindness.

1348
01:32:12,627 --> 01:32:14,822
Oh, tis no trouble, Mr Wesley.

1349
01:32:14,929 --> 01:32:18,023
We are delighted to
have you at our table.

1350
01:32:18,132 --> 01:32:19,997
...And the vicar says
this man Wesley

1351
01:32:20,101 --> 01:32:21,500
is a threat to the Church!

1352
01:32:23,938 --> 01:32:24,836
The good folk around here

1353
01:32:24,939 --> 01:32:27,407
they are in such need of
hearing your message.

1354
01:32:27,508 --> 01:32:29,305
...And l say we should
go out and get him!

1355
01:32:31,045 --> 01:32:32,103
l believe that the
folk everywhere

1356
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:33,680
are in need of hearing
about God's love.

1357
01:32:36,984 --> 01:32:38,781
'Ere, what's that?

1358
01:32:42,723 --> 01:32:46,454
Oh, blessed Lord, it's a
mob, and they're comin' here!

1359
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:48,722
Alright, you heard him,
children, let's hold hands,

1360
01:32:48,829 --> 01:32:49,659
let's pray.

1361
01:32:51,799 --> 01:32:55,826
[praying]

1362
01:33:00,074 --> 01:33:03,942
Oh, Mr. Wesley,
they'll burn the place down!

1363
01:33:04,045 --> 01:33:05,137
What are we going to do?

1364
01:33:14,288 --> 01:33:16,085
lt's me they want.

1365
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:17,122
Lock the door.

1366
01:33:20,695 --> 01:33:35,201
[crowd yelling]

1367
01:33:35,309 --> 01:33:36,799
l am John Wesley!

1368
01:33:36,911 --> 01:33:38,071
Why do you come out
against me with clubs

1369
01:33:38,179 --> 01:33:39,874
as if l were a criminal?

1370
01:33:39,981 --> 01:33:41,539
What wrong have l done you?

1371
01:33:41,649 --> 01:33:44,117
You preach heresy!

1372
01:33:44,218 --> 01:33:46,584
Heresy?

1373
01:33:46,687 --> 01:33:51,784
l preach the Bible,
l preach of God's love!

1374
01:33:51,892 --> 01:33:55,487
l have come here to help
you to improve your lives.

1375
01:33:55,596 --> 01:33:56,585
What wrong is there in that?

1376
01:33:56,697 --> 01:33:59,165
Yer given' folk ideas
above their station!

1377
01:33:59,266 --> 01:34:00,255
Above their station?

1378
01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:07,902
Each one of you
is a child of God,

1379
01:34:08,009 --> 01:34:11,536
each one of you has the
chance to become a great soul.

1380
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:13,375
What station is
there better than that?

1381
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:14,743
Heresy!

1382
01:34:14,849 --> 01:34:16,316
What station higher?

1383
01:34:16,417 --> 01:34:18,476
[crowd yelling]

1384
01:34:18,586 --> 01:34:20,747
Will you hear me speak?

1385
01:34:20,855 --> 01:34:23,517
Kill him!

1386
01:34:23,624 --> 01:34:24,648
Let him speak!

1387
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:37,604
l know that some of
you are here tonight

1388
01:34:37,705 --> 01:34:42,642
because you've been
paid to do so.

1389
01:34:42,743 --> 01:34:46,201
But l would ask you this:
Did they ask you to do this

1390
01:34:46,313 --> 01:34:50,977
because they care for
yourwives, your children?

1391
01:34:51,085 --> 01:34:53,212
Or do they simply
look to use you?

1392
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:57,620
And how often would you
allow them to do that?

1393
01:34:57,725 --> 01:35:01,183
l have come to tell you
how you may be free

1394
01:35:01,295 --> 01:35:03,695
of the sin that binds you.

1395
01:35:03,798 --> 01:35:06,392
l'e come to help you!

1396
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:08,661
The mine owners,

1397
01:35:08,769 --> 01:35:14,230
they do not want me to speak
the plain truth to you.

1398
01:35:14,341 --> 01:35:16,332
They would rather hold you
in ignorance of the truth:

1399
01:35:16,444 --> 01:35:19,880
that you too may be saved.

1400
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:23,313
They would rather
treat you like animals,

1401
01:35:23,417 --> 01:35:25,681
that you would work yourselves
to death in the mines

1402
01:35:25,786 --> 01:35:29,950
without a glimmer of hope.

1403
01:35:30,057 --> 01:35:34,426
But l am come here to
preach hope to you,

1404
01:35:34,528 --> 01:35:38,055
the hope of God's saving faith!

1405
01:35:38,165 --> 01:35:40,690
Now, l know that
there are those here

1406
01:35:40,801 --> 01:35:43,531
who are bound to
the slavery of gin.

1407
01:35:43,637 --> 01:35:48,097
And you wake each
morning to the gin-sickness,

1408
01:35:48,209 --> 01:35:54,114
to realize that the night before
you have beaten your wives.

1409
01:35:54,215 --> 01:35:57,582
And you swear that you
will never do it again,

1410
01:35:57,685 --> 01:35:59,550
but evening comes around

1411
01:35:59,653 --> 01:36:04,181
and you are once again
falling into the slavery.

1412
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:07,283
Many of you have been
told all your lives

1413
01:36:07,394 --> 01:36:09,419
that you are marked
to burn in hell,

1414
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:12,021
and that there is nothing
that you can do about it.

1415
01:36:12,133 --> 01:36:18,834
But l am here to
tell you that is a lie,

1416
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:23,000
you are as much a child of
God as the gentry orthe vicar.

1417
01:36:28,149 --> 01:36:34,850
God is waiting, He is waiting
for you to give Him your hearts.

1418
01:36:34,955 --> 01:36:43,090
And if you would but do
that, you all would be saved.

1419
01:36:55,242 --> 01:36:59,110
l came here tonight
to kill you, Wesley.

1420
01:36:59,213 --> 01:37:01,773
But now l will spend
my life to protect you.

1421
01:37:16,063 --> 01:37:16,130
Truly, l shouldn't be here.

1422
01:37:16,130 --> 01:37:19,258
Truly, l shouldn't be here.

1423
01:37:19,366 --> 01:37:22,199
l must have had a
guardian angel on my shoulder.

1424
01:37:22,303 --> 01:37:25,238
The opposition we face
may be a terrible trial

1425
01:37:25,339 --> 01:37:28,706
but more and more letters come
in for you to preach every day.

1426
01:37:28,809 --> 01:37:31,835
Surely we are
winning this battle?

1427
01:37:31,946 --> 01:37:32,537
Look, John.

1428
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:57,701
You're not ordained!

1429
01:37:57,805 --> 01:38:01,366
lt's true, sir, we don't have
the learning you gentlemen do,

1430
01:38:01,475 --> 01:38:02,908
but we know the Word.

1431
01:38:03,010 --> 01:38:04,477
And we believe.

1432
01:38:04,578 --> 01:38:08,344
We know God's word.

1433
01:38:08,449 --> 01:38:11,850
l'm absolutely
opposed to the idea.

1434
01:38:11,952 --> 01:38:13,078
Send out lay preachers

1435
01:38:13,187 --> 01:38:15,121
and you'll be seen
as ordaining priests.

1436
01:38:15,222 --> 01:38:16,189
lt's just the opening
our enemies need

1437
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:17,848
to say we have started
an illegal sect.

1438
01:38:17,958 --> 01:38:18,754
l'll not hear of it.

1439
01:38:18,859 --> 01:38:20,622
l completely agree
with Charles on this.

1440
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:21,626
l am sorry but...

1441
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:24,220
Mr. Wesley, with all
respect, sir--

1442
01:38:24,331 --> 01:38:26,697
the people, they're desperate.

1443
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:29,166
Thousands of souls
need encouragement,

1444
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:31,738
and you're only one man.

1445
01:38:31,839 --> 01:38:35,741
You've let us speak
before the societies,

1446
01:38:35,843 --> 01:38:38,004
you've even let women speak!

1447
01:38:38,112 --> 01:38:41,946
The societies in Bristol
need guidance, sir.

1448
01:38:42,049 --> 01:38:46,782
With your permission,
we'd both like to help.

1449
01:38:46,887 --> 01:38:49,549
Jackie, l have heard you preach

1450
01:38:49,657 --> 01:38:52,683
that all are equal
in the sight of God,

1451
01:38:52,793 --> 01:38:56,820
that faith is given
to simple souls...

1452
01:38:56,931 --> 01:38:59,729
You won't find many simpler
than us, Mr. Wesley!

1453
01:39:14,882 --> 01:39:18,010
lt's against my
better judgment.

1454
01:39:18,118 --> 01:39:25,650
But l will allow you to preach
for a time, gentlemen,

1455
01:39:25,759 --> 01:39:29,092
and we shall see how it goes.

1456
01:39:29,196 --> 01:39:31,562
Shall l tell Epworth
you are coming.

1457
01:39:31,665 --> 01:39:33,030
No. No.

1458
01:39:50,517 --> 01:39:51,449
My lord.

1459
01:39:51,552 --> 01:39:52,484
Yes, what is it?

1460
01:39:52,586 --> 01:39:54,178
l found this at the door, sir.

1461
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:01,724
Let's liken it to a square,

1462
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:05,697
where each side is
supported by the others.

1463
01:40:05,799 --> 01:40:09,360
And everything that we do is
interpreted using four criteria:

1464
01:40:09,470 --> 01:40:15,841
The Bible first of course,
and then reason, tradition,

1465
01:40:15,943 --> 01:40:19,435
and of course ending with
our own personal experience.

1466
01:40:19,546 --> 01:40:23,710
Ho, Mr. Wesley, you'll have
more people mad at you now,

1467
01:40:23,817 --> 01:40:27,378
if you say reason
and personal experience

1468
01:40:27,488 --> 01:40:30,821
must be applied to the Bible!

1469
01:40:30,924 --> 01:40:34,087
What did Jesus saywas the
first and greatest commandment?

1470
01:40:34,194 --> 01:40:36,185
Love the Lord your God
with all your heart,

1471
01:40:36,296 --> 01:40:39,356
with all your soul and...
with all your mind.

1472
01:40:39,466 --> 01:40:42,401
And with all your mind,
absolutely.

1473
01:40:42,503 --> 01:40:43,902
God would not have
given us wits

1474
01:40:44,004 --> 01:40:45,835
if He did not intend
us to use them!

1475
01:40:55,849 --> 01:41:00,513
These Methodies seek only to
destroy the Church of England,

1476
01:41:00,621 --> 01:41:04,079
to tear it down
stone by stone...

1477
01:41:11,532 --> 01:41:13,022
Gracious heavens!

1478
01:41:13,133 --> 01:41:15,328
They are allowing women
to speak in their meetings!

1479
01:41:16,703 --> 01:41:18,830
Several disorderly persons,

1480
01:41:18,939 --> 01:41:21,703
styling themselves as
Methodist preachers go about...

1481
01:41:21,809 --> 01:41:23,606
...And against the
peace of the King.

1482
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:24,836
All are commanded
to search after

1483
01:41:24,945 --> 01:41:26,207
the said Methodist preachers

1484
01:41:26,313 --> 01:41:29,373
and bring them before
the magistrates.

1485
01:41:29,483 --> 01:41:34,682
Our Father, which art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name.

1486
01:41:34,788 --> 01:41:37,416
Thy Kingdom come,
thy will be done

1487
01:41:37,524 --> 01:41:40,049
on earth as it is in heaven.

1488
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:43,027
Give us this day--

1489
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:46,156
You don't sound like a
Church of England preacher.

1490
01:41:46,266 --> 01:41:47,631
Ay?

1491
01:41:47,734 --> 01:41:50,362
And how does a Christian
sound to your ear, sir?

1492
01:41:53,373 --> 01:41:54,465
You preach forgiveness?

1493
01:41:57,578 --> 01:41:59,944
Yah, l forgive you.

1494
01:42:00,047 --> 01:42:00,672
Forgive this!

1495
01:42:32,813 --> 01:42:38,774
This would not have happened if
we'd not allowed him to preach.

1496
01:42:38,886 --> 01:42:41,980
We haven't done
anything, Charles.

1497
01:42:42,089 --> 01:42:44,057
We haven't.

1498
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:48,390
We have only
preached the truth.

1499
01:42:48,495 --> 01:42:54,331
Dear Mr. Seward
only preached the truth.

1500
01:42:54,434 --> 01:42:56,459
We are opposed because
we speak the truth!

1501
01:43:01,074 --> 01:43:02,632
lt could have been
you or me Charles.

1502
01:43:02,743 --> 01:43:04,404
Oh, no-- no, no!

1503
01:43:07,781 --> 01:43:10,648
<i>(John) We will persevere</i>.

1504
01:43:10,751 --> 01:43:12,309
<i>His death will not be in vain</i>.

1505
01:43:46,486 --> 01:43:48,977
l have a favorite story.

1506
01:43:49,089 --> 01:43:52,650
lt's about ''Little Bo Peep''
who lost her sheep.

1507
01:43:52,759 --> 01:43:56,661
God wants you to know He
does not play Bo Peep with us.

1508
01:43:56,763 --> 01:44:00,824
When He lost His sheep, He sent
His only Son to find them.

1509
01:44:09,643 --> 01:44:10,234
For the Kingdom of Heaven

1510
01:44:10,344 --> 01:44:12,869
is as a man traveling
to a far country,

1511
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:17,007
who called his own servants and
delivered to them his goods.

1512
01:44:17,117 --> 01:44:20,985
To one he gave five talents...

1513
01:44:21,088 --> 01:44:23,648
What do you think
of Mr. Wesle<i>y?</i>.

1514
01:44:23,757 --> 01:44:25,782
We ain't welcome
in the big church.

1515
01:44:25,892 --> 01:44:28,690
Mr. Wesley comes to us in
the fields to preach to us,

1516
01:44:28,795 --> 01:44:31,992
and we 'as meetings in our
'omes to study the Scriptures.

1517
01:44:32,099 --> 01:44:36,627
'E's been wonderful
to us, Mr. Wesley has.

1518
01:44:36,737 --> 01:44:42,403
And he that had received the one
went and digged into the earth

1519
01:44:42,509 --> 01:44:43,942
and hid his master's money.

1520
01:44:54,821 --> 01:44:56,220
Brother!

1521
01:44:56,323 --> 01:44:57,984
Charlie!

1522
01:44:58,091 --> 01:44:59,319
Good to see you.

1523
01:44:59,426 --> 01:45:01,018
You've just about
worn that horse out,

1524
01:45:01,128 --> 01:45:02,390
haven't you?

1525
01:45:02,496 --> 01:45:04,589
James, if you would please,
take good care of him.

1526
01:45:08,635 --> 01:45:11,866
Brother!

1527
01:45:11,972 --> 01:45:13,599
lt's good to be back.

1528
01:45:13,707 --> 01:45:15,299
How did it go
in Manchester?

1529
01:45:15,409 --> 01:45:17,502
Oh, very well.

1530
01:45:17,611 --> 01:45:19,238
But l must say that l'm a
bit worried about something.

1531
01:45:19,346 --> 01:45:20,540
What?

1532
01:45:20,647 --> 01:45:23,241
l realized while riding back
that l hadn't offended anyone

1533
01:45:23,350 --> 01:45:25,443
for at least three days.

1534
01:45:25,552 --> 01:45:27,349
l must be slipping!

1535
01:45:27,454 --> 01:45:29,922
l have no doubt you'll
make up for in the next week!

1536
01:45:30,023 --> 01:45:30,990
lndeed!

1537
01:45:31,091 --> 01:45:32,922
Do you know what
Mr. lngham figured out?

1538
01:45:33,026 --> 01:45:34,084
ln the last year,

1539
01:45:34,194 --> 01:45:38,790
you rode over 5,000 miles
preaching around England.

1540
01:45:38,899 --> 01:45:39,593
5,000?

1541
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:41,565
Yes.

1542
01:45:41,668 --> 01:45:43,727
When you put it that way,
it sounds like a lot!

1543
01:45:43,837 --> 01:45:45,031
We've come up with a
new nickname for you...

1544
01:45:45,138 --> 01:45:45,604
Yes?

1545
01:45:45,706 --> 01:45:46,604
Yes!

1546
01:45:46,707 --> 01:45:47,639
Old Leatherbreeches!

1547
01:45:50,677 --> 01:45:53,544
This man is a
menace to the Church,

1548
01:45:53,647 --> 01:45:56,013
and must be defrocked
and excommunicated!

1549
01:45:56,116 --> 01:45:58,550
What do the rest of you think?

1550
01:45:58,652 --> 01:46:00,813
Yes, definitely yes.

1551
01:46:00,921 --> 01:46:01,512
Yes.

1552
01:46:01,621 --> 01:46:02,781
Yes l would think so.

1553
01:46:05,759 --> 01:46:08,319
Bishop Ryder?

1554
01:46:08,428 --> 01:46:12,228
How many of you men have
heard this man preach?

1555
01:46:12,332 --> 01:46:13,924
We have heard many reports!

1556
01:46:14,034 --> 01:46:15,399
l have.

1557
01:46:15,502 --> 01:46:21,372
Outside of Manchester in
a field a fortnight ago.

1558
01:46:21,475 --> 01:46:26,777
And gentlemen, l must tell you
l was unable to lay hands

1559
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:31,374
on anything that he said
that was not Scriptural

1560
01:46:31,485 --> 01:46:34,818
or in keeping with the teachings
of the Church of England.

1561
01:46:34,921 --> 01:46:37,253
He is rude to people of quality

1562
01:46:37,357 --> 01:46:40,053
and does not care
who he offends!

1563
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:43,891
lt's true -- he speaks
with great bluntness,

1564
01:46:43,997 --> 01:46:46,022
and offends many, no doubt.

1565
01:46:46,133 --> 01:46:50,866
But if we are offended
by truth bluntly spoken,

1566
01:46:50,971 --> 01:46:54,168
we must have a good deal of
house-keeping to do ourselves.

1567
01:46:54,274 --> 01:47:00,577
The truth is, gentlemen,
that as irritating as he is,

1568
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:05,117
he has created a most
remarkable ministry to the poor

1569
01:47:05,218 --> 01:47:08,779
in places that we have ignored.

1570
01:47:08,889 --> 01:47:13,883
Ratherthan defrocking him, l
think we should be thanking him!

1571
01:47:16,897 --> 01:47:18,797
Very good.

1572
01:47:18,899 --> 01:47:20,730
So, what of the
other correspondence?

1573
01:47:20,834 --> 01:47:23,632
We have several more requests.

1574
01:47:23,737 --> 01:47:27,298
One from Leeds,
another from Aberstwyth.

1575
01:47:27,407 --> 01:47:28,999
This one's from Epworth.

1576
01:47:31,711 --> 01:47:32,609
Ah.

1577
01:47:38,318 --> 01:47:39,649
l'm simply not
ready for Epworth.

1578
01:47:44,057 --> 01:47:45,490
Jack--

1579
01:47:45,592 --> 01:47:46,650
Oh!

1580
01:47:56,536 --> 01:48:09,813
[screams]

1581
01:48:09,916 --> 01:48:12,384
Do you know that the thought
of preaching in Epworth

1582
01:48:12,486 --> 01:48:18,550
fills me with a sense
of dread, of doom.

1583
01:48:18,658 --> 01:48:21,855
Like the feeling
that l can't breathe.

1584
01:48:21,962 --> 01:48:25,022
For heaven's sake,
why, John?

1585
01:48:25,131 --> 01:48:27,725
Everything, Charles.

1586
01:48:27,834 --> 01:48:30,234
The fire, the rejection.

1587
01:48:30,337 --> 01:48:31,827
They hate us!

1588
01:48:31,938 --> 01:48:35,669
What if they will not hearthe
message because of who l am?

1589
01:48:35,775 --> 01:48:36,901
Because of who Fatherwas?

1590
01:48:37,010 --> 01:48:39,171
He was convinced that a
farm worker set the fire.

1591
01:48:39,279 --> 01:48:40,746
Oh nonsense!

1592
01:48:40,847 --> 01:48:43,543
There wasn't a whit
of evidence forthat.

1593
01:48:43,650 --> 01:48:46,346
lt was more likely just a
spark from the chimney

1594
01:48:46,453 --> 01:48:48,045
on the thatch roof.

1595
01:48:48,154 --> 01:48:48,984
Yes, but Father said --

1596
01:48:49,089 --> 01:48:51,785
William Seward died
preaching the truth.

1597
01:48:51,892 --> 01:48:54,292
Where is yourfaith,
John Wesley?

1598
01:49:09,576 --> 01:49:10,508
lt hasn't changed.

1599
01:49:14,915 --> 01:49:16,439
Let's go, brother.

1600
01:49:22,656 --> 01:49:23,418
Good day.

1601
01:49:23,523 --> 01:49:24,353
l am John Wesley and this is --

1602
01:49:24,457 --> 01:49:26,721
Yes l know who you are.

1603
01:49:26,826 --> 01:49:29,624
Yes, well, l have had letters
from some of your parishioners

1604
01:49:29,729 --> 01:49:30,889
they've been asking that
l come here to preach.

1605
01:49:30,997 --> 01:49:32,328
Not from my pulpit, sir!

1606
01:49:32,432 --> 01:49:35,924
Be so kind as to remove
yourself from this parish ...

1607
01:49:36,036 --> 01:49:38,163
and see to it that
you never return!

1608
01:49:41,775 --> 01:49:43,709
That's exactly what l expected.

1609
01:49:43,810 --> 01:49:45,277
Shall we see about
the people who matter.

1610
01:49:45,378 --> 01:49:46,140
Aye.

1611
01:49:54,054 --> 01:49:58,081
Mr. Wesley is preaching
tonight at six o'clock -

1612
01:49:58,191 --> 01:50:02,059
Mr. Wesley will be preaching
here, tonight at six o'clock.

1613
01:50:02,162 --> 01:50:05,962
Mr. Wesley is preaching over by
the church, do you want to go?

1614
01:50:06,066 --> 01:50:09,365
Thomas - down by church --
six o'clock -

1615
01:50:13,974 --> 01:50:17,034
<i>(John) Do you know</i>
<i>it's been eight years</i>

1616
01:50:17,143 --> 01:50:18,167
<i>since l was here last?</i>

1617
01:50:24,718 --> 01:50:26,709
What are we doing here,
Charles?

1618
01:50:26,820 --> 01:50:28,788
This is ridiculous, do you
really think anyone will come?

1619
01:50:33,693 --> 01:50:34,523
Yes, l do.

1620
01:51:01,921 --> 01:51:03,218
<i>(Charles) You see, Jackie?</i>

1621
01:51:03,323 --> 01:51:05,791
<i>Yourfears were in vain</i>.

1622
01:51:05,892 --> 01:51:07,621
<i>(John) l didn't know there were</i>
<i>that many people in Epworth</i>.

1623
01:51:19,105 --> 01:51:21,733
John, lt's time for you to
preach to the good people

1624
01:51:21,841 --> 01:51:23,206
of Epworth.

1625
01:51:31,885 --> 01:51:36,584
The seeds you've
planted now bear fruit...

1626
01:51:49,903 --> 01:51:58,504
My friends, l am John Wesley

1627
01:51:58,611 --> 01:52:06,040
and l am come to tell you
about the Kingdom of Heaven.

1628
01:52:06,152 --> 01:52:08,450
Faith is not found
in outward actions,

1629
01:52:08,555 --> 01:52:10,386
or rites and ceremonies.

1630
01:52:10,490 --> 01:52:13,857
Not even of the
most excellent kind.

1631
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:17,862
No, the religion of Christ
rises infinitely higher

1632
01:52:17,964 --> 01:52:23,596
and immensely deeper
than all of these.

1633
01:52:23,703 --> 01:52:27,799
lt is a kingdom not
of meat and drink,

1634
01:52:27,907 --> 01:52:31,843
or of outward ritual,

1635
01:52:31,945 --> 01:52:36,541
neither is it in right
doctrine or intellectual belief.

1636
01:52:36,649 --> 01:52:37,581
No!

1637
01:52:40,987 --> 01:52:44,252
Christ is found in a heart
transformed by love.

1638
01:52:47,961 --> 01:52:52,330
Thou shalt love thy God
with all thy heart

1639
01:52:52,432 --> 01:52:57,495
and with all thy mind
and with all thy soul

1640
01:52:57,604 --> 01:53:03,839
and with all thy strength
and thy neighbor as thyself.
