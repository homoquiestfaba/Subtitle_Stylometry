1
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:08,106
<i>Front door!</i>

2
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:09,524
I can't let it in unless I see it.

3
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:12,235
I know what the rules are.
I'm just asking if you can make an exception.

4
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:14,279
There are no exceptions.
That's why we have rules.

5
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:16,489
I know what a rule is.
I'm just telling you...

6
00:03:16,573 --> 00:03:17,824
You don't have an X-ray machine back there?

7
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:19,701
You don't have an X-ray machine?

8
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:20,952
No. I've got to see it.

9
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:44,392
<i>I bet you're not going
to miss that drive.</i>

10
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:47,854
Or the ambiance.

11
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:51,065
I would've gone a lot further.

12
00:03:57,155 --> 00:04:01,492
You know, they gave me
a brochure on reintegrating.

13
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:02,744
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:04,829
A social worker came by.

15
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,123
What did he say?

16
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,335
Go slow.

17
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,255
We can go slow.

18
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:29,646
- Hey.
- Hey.

19
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:34,233
I just wanted to remind you that
I won't be coming in tomorrow.

20
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:37,070
That's right. It's the big day!

21
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:39,405
You must be thrilled...

22
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:40,573
Yeah.

23
00:04:40,657 --> 00:04:43,076
and excited and nervous and...

24
00:04:43,785 --> 00:04:46,454
And I wanted to thank you,
just for everything.

25
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:48,122
You've been so understanding.

26
00:04:48,206 --> 00:04:51,876
Oh, I'm sure there's more to it
than what's on the news, so...

27
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,797
I know, but to a lot of people
you say "insider trading,"

28
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,134
and it may as well be murder.
You just stop existing.

29
00:05:00,218 --> 00:05:02,345
So, thank you for everything.

30
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:08,893
I wasn't sure what I should wear.

31
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:13,106
I tried to find something new to buy,

32
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:16,317
but I couldn't find anything that looked good.

33
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:18,569
Honey, you look beautiful.

34
00:05:18,987 --> 00:05:22,407
And I can only imagine
how you're gonna look to him.

35
00:05:38,947 --> 00:05:41,092
Oh, Mama.

36
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,016
Come on. Let's get out of here
before they change their mind.

37
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,124
I'm sorry.

38
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:25,136
<i>Babe, you remember that hedge fund manager
I met inside?</i>

39
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:27,430
Marshall Hellman?

40
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:30,433
- The Stanford guy?
- Yeah.

41
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:35,271
Super smart. He was in for some tax thing,
but he'll be out soon.

42
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:39,942
He's got money in Dubai
and a lot of connections.

43
00:06:41,986 --> 00:06:44,072
I can get us back to where we were, Em.

44
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:46,616
I promise. I can make that happen.

45
00:06:48,785 --> 00:06:50,286
Okay, baby.

46
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:07,845
Thank you.

47
00:08:04,861 --> 00:08:06,779
I don't understand what you're saying!
Just relax!

48
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:08,447
Hello.

49
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:09,991
I'm Dr. Banks.

50
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:13,286
This guy's on something, okay?
Listen, just relax!

51
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:14,996
- Officer.
- This guy's on something.

52
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,956
He came swinging at me.

53
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,124
Stand back and let me talk to him.

54
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,293
He was trying to hold up a taxi.

55
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:21,669
You understand? He came at me!

56
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:37,602
Augustin? Augustin.

57
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,565
He's fine.

58
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:09,884
What is it? What's going on?

59
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:12,720
He saw his dead father driving the taxi.

60
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,472
What?

61
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:17,808
He saw the ghost of his father.
He was a cabbie.

62
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:19,727
So I was right. He's nuts.

63
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,729
No. It's grief.

64
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:25,566
Just grief painting pictures in his brain.

65
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,318
He sees ghosts.

66
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:34,075
He's Haitian.
It's not unusual for Haitians

67
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:35,576
to see their loved ones
shortly after they die.

68
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,663
Weird for me and you,
but it's perfectly normal for him.

69
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:40,248
Right, what do you have next?

70
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:44,585
MVA in bed eight, with minor head trauma,
in need of a consult.

71
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,799
Double shift today?

72
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:51,384
Better living through chemistry.

73
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:57,556
Miss Taylor.

74
00:09:57,682 --> 00:09:59,392
- Yeah?
- I'm Dr. Banks.

75
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:02,520
Oh, they said I might have a concussion,

76
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,397
but I don't have to stay here
for that, right?

77
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,400
Uh, we have to wait for the
CT scan results to know that.

78
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:09,902
I have a couple of questions for you.

79
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:11,696
How's your head?

80
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:13,614
It hurts.

81
00:10:13,698 --> 00:10:15,908
How was it before you hit the wall?

82
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,619
What do you mean?

83
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:20,579
How have things been going with you?

84
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,540
Generally speaking.

85
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:28,421
Why are you here?

86
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:31,340
I'm a psychiatrist, Miss Taylor.

87
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:33,175
Normally,

88
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:35,720
when people hit things with their car,

89
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:39,265
there are skid marks on the pavement.

90
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:43,144
A brick Wall's a pretty good reason
to use the brakes,

91
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:44,353
turn the wheel.

92
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,523
You didn't do that.
You went straight in.

93
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,443
It says here the attendant told the police

94
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:53,821
you were pretty upset
before you got in the car.

95
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:57,033
Now, the insurance company
are gonna check the brakes,

96
00:10:57,116 --> 00:10:59,076
but I prefer to just ask you.

97
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:04,040
Did you try to hurt yourself this morning?

98
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:20,306
Do you still want to try and hurt yourself?

99
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,266
Emily.

100
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:29,398
How do you feel about staying here
for a few days?

101
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:32,243
Here?

102
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:35,404
No, I can't stay here.

103
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:39,283
Martin just got home
and I have to be there for him.

104
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:40,868
Is that your husband, Martin?

105
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:43,496
Yes, and he just got out of prison.

106
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:46,332
I have to be there, and I have a job.
I have to go into work.

107
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,876
He doesn't make any money yet.

108
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:52,171
Are you married?

109
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:53,881
Yes.

110
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,216
Okay, what if you got out of jail

111
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:57,635
or you were away for a long time
and you come home

112
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,596
and your wife is in the mental hospital?

113
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,683
We waited for four years.
I can't stay here.

114
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,562
I think you may have tried
to hurt yourself this morning, and...

115
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:11,482
It was a mistake. I lost it for a minute.

116
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,777
I promise, that's not going to happen again.

117
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:17,714
Do you have an office?

118
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:21,033
Well, I could come see you at your office.

119
00:12:21,117 --> 00:12:22,326
I could come as often as you want.

120
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:25,079
I could come two or three times a week.

121
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:26,914
I was in therapy once before,

122
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:30,835
and I remember that structure
really helps with hopelessness.

123
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:34,922
I promise. I just really want to go home.

124
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:38,008
Okay. So we'll release her to you,

125
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:42,221
but I want to see her in my office this week.
That's the deal we made.

126
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,723
I just had no idea
this was still going on.

127
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:47,101
Oh, honey, I think she must have
been putting on a brave face.

128
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,645
She was afraid to tell you.
She was afraid to tell me.

129
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,772
I want to start her on this.
It's called an SSRI.

130
00:12:51,856 --> 00:12:55,192
It affects the neurotransmitter
in the brain called serotonin.

131
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:57,111
<i>What does that do exactly?</i>

132
00:12:57,194 --> 00:13:01,157
<i>Basically, it helps stop the brain
from telling you you're sad.</i>

133
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,952
<i>In a few weeks,
she should start to feel better.</i>

134
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,914
No, of course. Of course.

135
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:14,378
It was soft. Absolutely,
it was soft in that first...

136
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:17,590
But we are going to tighten it up.

137
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:20,050
Sure, that's what we do.

138
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:25,222
Yeah. I think it'll be interesting
to regroup after the Dallas groups.

139
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:28,559
Emily?

140
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:30,769
Are you okay?

141
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,538
Emily?

142
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:00,382
What happened?

143
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:06,722
These made me sick, too.

144
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,226
I had better luck with Celexa.

145
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:20,402
<i>I used to draw when I was a kid.
Mostly people, though.</i>

146
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:24,615
Teachers and kids from my class.

147
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:27,117
Boys that I liked.

148
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,994
Sometimes cats.

149
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:34,792
I used to try and get their faces perfect.

150
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:40,297
That's why I came to New York,
I wanted to get into graphic design.

151
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:43,008
I was taking classes when I met Martin.

152
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:44,510
How did that happen?

153
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:51,225
I was working at this, uh,
bar downtown to help pay for school,

154
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:54,311
and he kept coming in after work.

155
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:57,690
And he would just order
the most complicated drinks.

156
00:14:57,815 --> 00:15:00,359
Things that I had no idea how to make.

157
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,655
One night, he climbed over the bar

158
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,408
and offered to teach me
how to make them.

159
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:11,996
And he ended up staying until we closed.
Then he asked me out.

160
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:13,956
And you went.

161
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:19,336
I didn't know who he was or what he did.
He was just...

162
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:22,840
He was just this guy in a suit.

163
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:26,594
And watched me while I made drinks,

164
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:29,638
and that made me really nervous.

165
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:33,017
Then he stared at me
like I was a painting.

166
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:38,355
He had this beautiful sailboat,
and he took me out on it.

167
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:40,524
Taught me how to ski.

168
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,527
He swept me off my feet.

169
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:49,033
Proposed to me in Maui that winter
and we were married by spring.

170
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,412
How old were you?

171
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:59,793
That was five years ago, so I was 23.

172
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,717
Time goes by so fast.

173
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:12,222
Is this ever going to go away?

174
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,976
You said you felt depressed before.

175
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:18,354
Did you see anyone about it last time?

176
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:22,274
Yeah. In Greenwich, Connecticut.
Victoria Siebert.

177
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:25,402
I had to stop seeing her
when they took our house away

178
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:28,197
and I had to move back to the city.

179
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,158
Do you mind if I contact Dr. Siebert
about your history?

180
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:32,826
No, of course not.

181
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,912
<i>I saw her four years ago.</i>

182
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,331
For a little over nine months.

183
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:39,083
She didn't just have the rug
pulled from under her,

184
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,378
she had the rug, the home, the husband.

185
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:44,588
Her entire life, gone.

186
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:50,761
Even her health insurance.
She moved into the city to find work

187
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,639
and I never heard from her again.

188
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:57,601
I'm glad she's seeing a man this time.
I think that will help.

189
00:16:58,477 --> 00:16:59,645
Why is that?

190
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,356
Never felt seen by her father.

191
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:06,276
Then her husband ends up in jail
and she's abandoned again.

192
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:10,823
I'd be happy to see her
have a different kind of experience.

193
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:14,076
She says you tried her on medication.

194
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:18,997
Oh, yes. Wellbutrin. Prozac. Effexor.

195
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,325
Really struggled.

196
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,587
I remember she had problems
with sleep and nausea. Chills...

197
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:28,215
I'm putting her on Zoloft,
see if she can tolerate that.

198
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:31,593
Well, maybe she's a candidate
for one of these newer meds.

199
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:34,138
Sometimes the newest thing
gives them confidence.

200
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:38,350
They see the ads on TV, they believe.

201
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:41,562
I have a patient with some similar issues.

202
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:43,522
I put her on Ablixa.

203
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,566
Welcome, everyone!
Thank you for coming.

204
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:47,359
We'll be starting the presentations soon,

205
00:17:47,443 --> 00:17:49,486
so if everyone can come in
and take a seat.

206
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:55,993
You know, I may have some samples here.
Let me see.

207
00:17:57,494 --> 00:18:00,539
No. I must have given them all away.

208
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,584
Here! Have an Ablixa pen.

209
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:06,712
Had it been available back then,

210
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:10,090
I would have prescribed it for Emily
after she miscarried.

211
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:11,200
Miscarried?

212
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:13,343
After he went to jail.

213
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:15,512
She, uh, hasn't mentioned that.

214
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:16,889
- No?
- No.

215
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:18,265
Has he been released yet?

216
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:19,533
A week ago.

217
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:21,810
Well, maybe that will help
turn things around.

218
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:26,982
Look, don't mention anything
to Carl or Kayla

219
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:29,735
about Hellman.
It'll just make things easier.

220
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:36,575
I still think Carl's the one
who went to the Feds.

221
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,203
He probably gave us these tickets

222
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:42,164
because he feels shitty about everything.

223
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,294
I hope these things work.

224
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,087
Hey.

225
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:55,969
Look, if you don't feel up to this,
I can go by myself.

226
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,640
I understand if you don't want
to see those people.

227
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:00,933
<i>All right?</i>

228
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:03,310
<i>But I got to get back out there
at some point.</i>

229
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:06,522
<i>If I just sit here by myself,
I'm just gonna feel worse.</i>

230
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:10,192
<i>I have to at least try.
Dr. Banks would want me to try.</i>

231
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:24,748
Carl?

232
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:26,750
Martin! Welcome back.

233
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:28,210
- How are you, sir?
- Hi!

234
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:29,795
- Emily, good to see you.
- Hi. Good to see you.

235
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,922
Kayla, you remember this beautiful lady here.

236
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,006
Hi.

237
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,133
Thank you so much for having us.

238
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:39,346
Oh, my, your dress is beautiful!
I love it. It's gorgeous.

239
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:41,431
Thank you. We're so glad
you guys could come.

240
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:43,517
It's our pleasure. Thanks again.

241
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:50,357
I'm going to go to the bar and get a drink.
Does anyone want anything?

242
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,859
Is that such a good idea?

243
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:54,403
Yeah, it's fine. I'll be right back.

244
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:58,740
She looks amazing!

245
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:00,659
She's doing well.

246
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:03,996
But going away is hard,
and so is coming back, for everyone.

247
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,498
Martin, I just want to say
I wish I had done

248
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:08,041
a better job of reaching out.
I really do.

249
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:12,462
No. That's fine. It's the culture.
It's over now.

250
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,383
Good evening, ma'am.
Can I get you something?

251
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:18,802
Yes, a vodka seltzer, please.

252
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:36,904
There you go. Enjoy.

253
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:38,280
Thank you.

254
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:47,998
Em. So, Martin was just telling...

255
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,586
Honey, what's wrong?

256
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:57,007
I can't do this.

257
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:04,014
You know, I went through
a very bad time last year.

258
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:06,934
I found a lump.

259
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:09,853
I just fell apart.
I was so depressed,

260
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:13,190
and, uh, my doctor prescribed
something called Effexor.

261
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,818
It really helped.

262
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:23,325
Can you get Martin for me?

263
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:27,079
Yeah.

264
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:04,324
Hey.

265
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:06,076
I'm sorry.

266
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:09,162
I'm sorry! I can't, I'm sorry.

267
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:11,289
It's okay, it's okay.

268
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,791
Come here.

269
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:27,115
Not so close, ma'am!

270
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:30,869
Thank you.

271
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:43,548
Oh, the advantages of having a husband
who can write prescriptions.

272
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:48,512
What are they called again?

273
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:50,014
It's a beta blocker.

274
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:55,352
Is it bad that I'm doing this?

275
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:56,812
Everyone takes them.

276
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,939
Lawyers, musicians.

277
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:01,316
People going to interviews for big jobs.

278
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:04,111
It doesn't make you anything you're not.

279
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:07,697
It just makes it easier for you
to be who you are.

280
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:12,744
It's between me and two other people.

281
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:15,447
A woman from Merrill
and a guy from Citicorp.

282
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:17,457
But Hazlitt says I have the inside track.

283
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:21,545
Sorry, D. I've got to return this.
It's an emergency.

284
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:24,548
This girl is really struggling.

285
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,969
Dr. Banks, I really need to talk to you.

286
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:30,053
Emily.

287
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:33,014
Yeah. I just got your message.

288
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:35,058
I'm with my wife.

289
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,564
I went to your office, but you weren't there.
So I came here.

290
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,191
Could we just go talk?

291
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:46,403
If it's an emergency,
I can admit you.

292
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,821
No. I just...

293
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:53,535
I was getting on the subway and...

294
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:59,708
And I was like when I was in the car.

295
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:06,506
I have to go to work.
I just need five minutes.

296
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,925
You're going to go to work after?

297
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:11,928
- Okay, five minutes.
- Okay.

298
00:25:12,596 --> 00:25:13,847
I'm sorry.

299
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,307
Call me after the interview.

300
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:25,275
<i>Emily, I know this is hard.</i>

301
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:29,029
<i>But the hopelessness you're feeling
is a symptom.</i>

302
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:31,031
<i>We have to leave that in the past.</i>

303
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:34,826
A psychologist once said,

304
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,537
"Depression is an inability
to construct a future."

305
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:42,459
But you have a future.
At home with Martin.

306
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,964
He's trying to start a new business.

307
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:51,635
With this guy Hellman
that he met in jail.

308
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:53,970
How does that make you feel?

309
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:56,306
I don't know. I mean, he's trying.

310
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:59,059
He's really trying to make things better

311
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:02,062
and I'm just not helping at all.

312
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:05,232
I mean, I'm trying, too.
I went...

313
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:10,570
I went shopping to try and make things
more exciting for him.

314
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:11,989
You are trying.

315
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:20,038
I can't take the Zoloft anymore.
I can't. I'm dizzy.

316
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:22,374
I can't sleep. I have no sex drive.

317
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:24,417
I understand that.

318
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:27,462
This woman I work with, Julia, she...

319
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:31,383
She said she's on this other, new medication,
and it's really helping her.

320
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:33,301
I thought maybe I could try that.

321
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:39,432
Taylor!

322
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:46,356
Have you taken Ablixa before?

323
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:47,649
No.

324
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:49,484
Some of the side effects may include

325
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:54,614
<i>nausea, muscle weakness, insomnia,
change in appetite,</i>

326
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:57,575
<i>dry mouth, irritation.</i>

327
00:26:58,076 --> 00:26:59,619
<i>Do you want to pay cash?</i>

328
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:02,747
<i>There were court seats at Knicks games,
fishing trips</i>

329
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:04,624
to Cape Cod. It was crazy.

330
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:07,711
One year, Warner-Lambert
took us to Hawaii.

331
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:11,631
I gave a talk for five minutes
and played 36 holes.

332
00:27:11,915 --> 00:27:14,301
What did Pfizer have to pay
to make their whole thing go away?

333
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:15,427
Two billion?

334
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,846
Lilly paid over a billion
to settle the Zyprexa thing.

335
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:21,141
Do we have to talk about this?
You're ruining my lunch.

336
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:23,351
A certain rep, who will remain nameless,

337
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:25,186
gave me tickets to the World Series.

338
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,239
Got my son an autographed ball!

339
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:29,691
If only I'd known you liked baseball.

340
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:31,526
Where was I for all this?

341
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:34,154
Some British boarding school, probably.

342
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:37,949
Well, it's not a violation of the pharma code
to buy you doctors lunch

343
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:40,952
as long as we talk about business
for at least five minutes.

344
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:42,412
Ready? Go!

345
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:46,333
We're starting a trial for our new
anti-anxiety drug, Delatrex.

346
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:49,044
We're looking for a couple of docs to consult.

347
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:52,339
It's probably going to run for about a year.
Any interest?

348
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:55,884
I'm out. I'm doing something for the competition.
Signed an NDA.

349
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:58,470
You should cancel her filet for that.

350
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:01,222
I'm teaching next semester
and feeling a little overextended.

351
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:03,350
How about you, Dr. Banks? Too busy?

352
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:07,103
Not as busy as my partners.
What do you need?

353
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:09,047
<i>Getting warmer, but, no.</i>

354
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:14,077
Thirty thousand?

355
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:17,155
Fifty thousand.

356
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:18,531
- Really?
- Yes.

357
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:19,824
Really.

358
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:21,826
What do you have to do?

359
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:26,664
Go to a few meetings, recruit some patients,
track some data.

360
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:28,666
So you'll be even busier.

361
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,959
Yes.

362
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:34,214
But the flip side is

363
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,384
that if, for instance,

364
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:40,512
the buttons on this shirt

365
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:43,431
suddenly fell off,

366
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:46,518
I would be able to buy a new one.

367
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:49,479
Oh, I see.

368
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:51,439
Mom?

369
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:57,112
Yes, honey! In here, sweetie.
Just unpacking.

370
00:28:58,154 --> 00:28:59,906
I was having a bad dream.

371
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:01,008
Oh, love.

372
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:05,829
Honey, you're in luck.
Jon is very good with dreams.

373
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:08,456
- Yes, I am.
- So, he's gonna help you.

374
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,666
Back to bed, sweetie.

375
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:13,837
Do I have to dream when I sleep?

376
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,339
Yeah, I'm pretty much sure we all do.

377
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:18,508
They don't all have to be bad.

378
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:21,845
Albert Einstein, remember him?

379
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:23,054
Yeah.

380
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,266
He figured out relativity in a dream.

381
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:29,018
And Paul McCartney wrote entire songs.

382
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:33,356
And I dreamt of your mom
before I even met her.

383
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:37,110
So what are you going to dream about?

384
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:33,875
Whoever makes this drug
is going to be fucking rich.

385
00:30:58,608 --> 00:30:59,776
Em!

386
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:05,782
Em! It's the middle of the night.
Turn down the music!

387
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,788
Em?

388
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:18,336
Are we expecting someone?

389
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:23,466
Em, can you hear me?

390
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:29,222
What are you doing?

391
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:32,016
<i>Can't she stop taking drugs?</i>

392
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:34,143
- Isn't there an alternative approach...
- No!

393
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:36,563
God, no. I can finally sleep.

394
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:39,148
I have some energy. We had sex.

395
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:42,819
It was like we were actually together.

396
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,072
Maybe something else
would do the same thing.

397
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:50,076
Absolutely. There are still other SSRIs, SNRIs.

398
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,327
No.

399
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:53,746
I've tried everything else.
You don't know, Martin.

400
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,916
You've never had this.
You don't know what it's like.

401
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,502
Okay? Every afternoon it's like...

402
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:03,381
It's like there's this poisonous fog bank

403
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:06,009
rolling in on my mind,
and I'm paralyzed.

404
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:11,347
If I have to start over,
I think I should see a different doctor.

405
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:16,644
I'm sorry you feel that way.

406
00:32:16,728 --> 00:32:18,855
I understand your frustration.

407
00:32:20,797 --> 00:32:22,108
What do we do?

408
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:24,569
There are things we can do
to make this work.

409
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:26,654
<i>Other medications we add to the Ablixa,</i>

410
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:28,406
<i>one is designed to deal
with sleepwalking</i>

411
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:32,285
<i>while the Ablixa helps you get
a handle on your depression.</i>

412
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:34,537
I'm going to Otisville today.

413
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:38,541
They finally approved me
to see Hellman.

414
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:43,254
He's thinking we might want
to set up shop in Houston.

415
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:47,550
He's got a lot of connections down there.

416
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:50,470
I thought we were going
to move back to Greenwich.

417
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:56,934
I'm sure that we can find
great people in Houston, too.

418
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:03,066
I want to be totally clear that I am
being paid to participate in this study.

419
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:06,527
If you don't want to take part,
I totally understand.

420
00:33:06,611 --> 00:33:09,405
There are other meds besides Delatrex
I can prescribe.

421
00:33:10,073 --> 00:33:12,742
So, my medication is free.

422
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:15,495
I don't have to report it
to my insurance company or anything?

423
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:19,957
For as long as you choose to be a part
of the study, your meds are free.

424
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:21,918
Oh, that's great.

425
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:24,671
We'll start today.

426
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,898
<i>Emily, I don't understand.
It's almost 4:00.</i>

427
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:46,401
<i>What happened?</i>

428
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:52,281
I got on the train,
and I just forgot to get off.

429
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:58,579
Martin is thinking about moving us,

430
00:34:00,415 --> 00:34:01,916
and I'm just...

431
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:04,961
really...

432
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:09,215
Go home, Emily.

433
00:34:10,091 --> 00:34:13,052
But you have to know
this can't happen again.

434
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:16,097
It's not working for me.

435
00:34:58,556 --> 00:34:59,557
Hey.

436
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:04,061
Hey. Hey.

437
00:35:04,854 --> 00:35:06,481
What's happening?

438
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:11,360
They gave it to the guy from Citicorp.

439
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:14,030
Oh, I'm sorry, D.

440
00:35:15,964 --> 00:35:18,034
It's fucking hopeless.

441
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:43,601
Emily?

442
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:50,441
Hellman says you are going to love Houston.

443
00:35:51,776 --> 00:35:53,528
What'd you get me?

444
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,448
Em?

445
00:36:02,787 --> 00:36:03,955
Em?

446
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:08,960
God damn it. Em?

447
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:10,962
These fucking pills.

448
00:36:17,802 --> 00:36:18,928
Em.

449
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:22,807
You sleeping again?

450
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:25,935
Stop!

451
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:45,454
Em, call somebody.

452
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:48,082
Help me.

453
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:49,959
Call somebody.

454
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,795
Help me.

455
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:00,947
Did he hit you?

456
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:03,366
Did he threaten you?

457
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,710
Was anyone else here?
Who else was coming for dinner?

458
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,755
What?

459
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:23,260
I was asleep and I...

460
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:27,181
I woke up and I saw him.
He wasn't...

461
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:28,766
He wasn't moving.

462
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,602
And that's all...
That's all I remember.

463
00:38:36,107 --> 00:38:37,400
<i>Dr. Siebert.</i>

464
00:38:37,608 --> 00:38:40,987
Hello, there. I'm sorry to bother you.
It's Jon Banks.

465
00:38:41,445 --> 00:38:42,947
It's about Emily.

466
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:44,532
<i>Uh, there's been an incident.</i>

467
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:46,993
<i>No sign of forced entry,</i>

468
00:38:47,076 --> 00:38:48,911
<i>nobody else on the
building security camera.</i>

469
00:38:48,995 --> 00:38:50,121
The prints on the knife are hers.

470
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:51,664
Where is her lawyer?

471
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:55,042
She doesn't have one.
Just kept talking about you.

472
00:38:55,418 --> 00:38:57,670
No sign of struggle
on either one of them.

473
00:38:57,753 --> 00:38:59,046
She made the 911 call herself.

474
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:01,757
We had an appointment last night
that she didn't show up for.

475
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:05,469
When was the last time you saw her?

476
00:39:05,553 --> 00:39:06,637
Four days ago.

477
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:08,431
And what was she like?

478
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:14,061
Any idea why the dinner table
was set for three, Dr. Banks?

479
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:18,274
She doesn't remember anything
about a guest. Kids?

480
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:21,610
No, she didn't have children.

481
00:39:22,111 --> 00:39:23,946
She was taking these.

482
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,574
For depression, right?
I've seen the ads.

483
00:39:26,657 --> 00:39:28,367
She ever talk to you
about something like this?

484
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:30,578
I'd like to speak to her,
if that's possible.

485
00:39:30,661 --> 00:39:32,204
You can talk to her at Rikers.

486
00:39:32,288 --> 00:39:34,707
It's possible, you see,
that she was asleep.

487
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:37,418
What?

488
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:38,586
She walks in her sleep.

489
00:39:38,669 --> 00:39:40,212
That's maybe why
she doesn't remember anything.

490
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:42,214
It's a side effect of this medication.

491
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:46,802
She's had other episodes.

492
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:50,473
She kills people in her sleep, too.

493
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:58,773
Stand up, please. And turn around.

494
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:02,276
<i>She ever tell you anything to</i>

495
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:05,571
make you believe she could be violent,
or that he was?

496
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:07,448
And before you answer that

497
00:40:07,531 --> 00:40:11,869
or tell me about some kind of
patient-doctor confidentiality thing,

498
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:14,997
let's just think about the future here.

499
00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:17,333
The future?

500
00:40:18,334 --> 00:40:21,337
Well, this goes one of two ways, doesn't it?

501
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:25,841
See, either she's a murderer or

502
00:40:26,884 --> 00:40:29,136
she's a victim of her medical treatment.

503
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:33,182
In which case, you're the target
of a big civil suit.

504
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:37,186
<i>Either way, someone gets punished.</i>

505
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:40,231
<i>Her or you.</i>

506
00:40:43,192 --> 00:40:46,237
<i>The state's enjoyed working with you
in the past, Dr. Banks.</i>

507
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:49,824
<i>I'd like to see you consulting
with us on this one.</i>

508
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:53,035
This is different.

509
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:55,204
Is it?

510
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:02,545
I never want to see another pill again.

511
00:41:04,046 --> 00:41:06,549
They want me to take something else.

512
00:41:07,216 --> 00:41:09,510
Another pill to help me sleep.

513
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:16,517
I don't understand why this is happening.

514
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,232
Is there any way that

515
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:25,901
somebody else did it,

516
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:28,404
and made it look like me?

517
00:41:32,283 --> 00:41:34,285
I don't think so.

518
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,748
That's not what the police are saying.

519
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:49,842
I killed the wrong person.

520
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:56,390
I don't know what else I could have done.
She wanted to stay on it.

521
00:41:56,473 --> 00:41:59,018
Jon. You can't follow them around

522
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:00,686
taking things out of their hands

523
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:02,855
they might use to hurt themselves.

524
00:42:02,938 --> 00:42:06,192
We see them for an hour a day,
maybe a couple of times a week.

525
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:08,027
I think they're going to charge her.

526
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,445
With what?

527
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:13,616
You said she has no memory.
No criminal intent.

528
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:15,576
They can't do that.

529
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:18,621
<i>A man in Arizona.</i>

530
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:20,664
He killed his wife,
threw her in the pool,

531
00:42:20,748 --> 00:42:23,209
took off his bloody clothes,
put them in the trunk of his car.

532
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:25,711
Woke up the next morning,
no memory of it.

533
00:42:25,794 --> 00:42:28,088
Didn't even know she was dead
until they charged him with the crime.

534
00:42:28,172 --> 00:42:31,050
Neighbors even saw him
throw the body into the pool.

535
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:33,636
He was acquitted last year.

536
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:38,599
A woman bludgeoned her husband
while on vacation in Sanibel Island.

537
00:42:38,682 --> 00:42:42,102
They were both asleep at the time.
Another acquittal.

538
00:42:42,186 --> 00:42:45,147
I have to tell you,
I have been approached by the state

539
00:42:45,231 --> 00:42:46,732
to consult for them as well.

540
00:42:46,982 --> 00:42:48,651
I assumed as much.

541
00:42:49,026 --> 00:42:53,030
I am in a rather difficult spot here.
I hope you appreciate that.

542
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:55,532
I know you are, but if she goes away,

543
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:56,617
this does not look good for you.

544
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,953
It just makes the whole system look bad.

545
00:43:01,705 --> 00:43:03,958
She ever talk about killing her husband?

546
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:05,960
No. If she had,
I would have reported it.

547
00:43:06,669 --> 00:43:08,963
You spoken to any of the family?

548
00:43:09,046 --> 00:43:11,340
Martin's mother.
She's the one who hired me.

549
00:43:14,343 --> 00:43:16,178
We need your help.

550
00:43:21,517 --> 00:43:23,519
You want to talk about it?

551
00:43:29,024 --> 00:43:31,360
A patient of mine was arrested.

552
00:43:34,363 --> 00:43:36,031
For something bad?

553
00:43:36,365 --> 00:43:38,701
Yeah. Pretty bad.

554
00:43:42,705 --> 00:43:44,540
Did the person do it?

555
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:47,584
Are they guilty?

556
00:43:52,548 --> 00:43:54,133
In this case,

557
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,845
those are two very different things.

558
00:44:38,761 --> 00:44:42,181
I was afraid you would never want
to see me again.

559
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:49,605
I hope you know that if I could
trade places with Martin, I would.

560
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:54,026
I would give anything if there were someone
who could make that deal.

561
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:57,780
I just don't understand how it happened. How?

562
00:44:58,781 --> 00:45:00,282
I don't know.

563
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:04,787
I don't know. It doesn't fit for me.
It's like...

564
00:45:07,122 --> 00:45:09,291
It's like it never happened.

565
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:11,835
But I don't understand it.

566
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:15,964
You watch the commercials on TV,
people are getting better!

567
00:45:16,632 --> 00:45:19,927
I was getting better.
Dr. Banks was really helping me.

568
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:22,805
But, he just got out

569
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:25,516
and now he's gone.

570
00:45:26,517 --> 00:45:27,851
I know.

571
00:45:31,146 --> 00:45:33,148
Can I give you something?

572
00:45:34,525 --> 00:45:35,567
What?

573
00:45:35,651 --> 00:45:37,861
I want to make a statement.

574
00:45:45,202 --> 00:45:47,830
People need to know what can happen.

575
00:45:48,831 --> 00:45:50,707
For Martin's sake.

576
00:45:51,542 --> 00:45:52,835
<i>"We go to doctors</i>

577
00:45:53,502 --> 00:45:55,212
<i>"with our sadness</i>

578
00:45:55,295 --> 00:45:58,173
<i>"and our faith in the hope
they will guide us toward health.</i>

579
00:45:59,216 --> 00:46:02,553
<i>"But instead I have gone down a path
toward a misery</i>

580
00:46:02,845 --> 00:46:05,097
<i>"I never could have imagined.</i>

581
00:46:05,514 --> 00:46:08,267
<i>"And I have taken my loved ones with me.</i>

582
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:13,730
<i>"My only hope is that no one else
follows me to this place."</i>

583
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:17,651
<i>And again, this is a note
from your daughter-in-law.</i>

584
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:18,777
<i>Yes.</i>

585
00:46:18,861 --> 00:46:20,946
<i>Who may face murder charges.</i>

586
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:22,030
<i>Yes.</i>

587
00:46:22,364 --> 00:46:24,616
<i>For what a drug made her do.</i>

588
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:29,496
<i>We invited a representative from Sadler-Benelux,
the makers of Ablixa,</i>

589
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,290
<i>to come here this morning</i>

590
00:46:31,373 --> 00:46:34,001
<i>and discuss this very tragic story,
but they declined.</i>

591
00:46:34,084 --> 00:46:37,212
<i>However, our Dr. Peter Joubert,

592
00:46:37,379 --> 00:46:40,132
<i>who specializes in anti-depression drugs
like Ablixa,</i>

593
00:46:40,215 --> 00:46:41,300
<i>is here to discuss</i>

594
00:46:41,383 --> 00:46:43,051
<i>the dangers of these side effects.</i>

595
00:46:43,135 --> 00:46:46,513
<i>Peter, if nothing else,
this seems a very troubling gray area.</i>

596
00:46:46,597 --> 00:46:50,476
<i>Josh, it is.
And that is why the FDA, in 2004,</i>

597
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:53,562
<i>asked that anti-depressants come
with a black box warning...</i>

598
00:46:53,645 --> 00:46:54,980
Which one, zucchini or asparagus?

599
00:46:55,063 --> 00:46:57,107
<i>because their use was associated
with an increased risk</i>

600
00:46:57,191 --> 00:46:59,485
<i>of suicidality in children and adolescents.</i>

601
00:46:59,568 --> 00:47:02,529
- Zucchini or asparagus?
- I don't know. Both.

602
00:47:02,613 --> 00:47:05,032
<i>That warning was expanded to include
young adults in their 20s.</i>

603
00:47:05,115 --> 00:47:07,951
<i>Peter, where's the doctor in all this?</i>

604
00:47:08,035 --> 00:47:09,786
<i>What's his or her responsibility?</i>

605
00:47:10,078 --> 00:47:12,331
<i>I'm sure people have
a lot of questions for him.</i>

606
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:15,125
What about the permission slip
for the field trip?

607
00:47:15,209 --> 00:47:16,376
Do you have that?

608
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:19,171
Did you remember?
Are you excited? What?

609
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:23,175
- There he is! Dr. Banks!
- Did someone famous...

610
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:25,427
How long have you been seeing Emily Taylor?

611
00:47:25,511 --> 00:47:26,512
Seeing who?

612
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:28,680
Did you know that your husband
was treating Emily Taylor?

613
00:47:28,764 --> 00:47:29,890
Take him out of here.

614
00:47:29,973 --> 00:47:31,016
What is happening?

615
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:32,226
Go that way!

616
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:33,310
What about this picture?

617
00:47:33,393 --> 00:47:34,603
Have you seen the front page
of the <i>Post</i> today?

618
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:35,938
You have no comment
about any of this?

619
00:47:36,021 --> 00:47:37,856
No, not at the moment.

620
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,024
Do you have any comment
at all about this?

621
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:42,027
I have no comment. She's my patient.
That's all I can say.

622
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:43,195
What's your relationship?

623
00:47:43,362 --> 00:47:45,906
I saw some press people downstairs.

624
00:47:46,949 --> 00:47:48,784
I think they had cameras.

625
00:47:49,618 --> 00:47:51,370
Is that for you?

626
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,708
There's a back stairway,

627
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:59,711
if you'd be more comfortable
leaving that way.

628
00:48:03,715 --> 00:48:07,135
My wife never liked me coming here.

629
00:48:09,721 --> 00:48:12,474
I'm worried she's going to see something.

630
00:48:14,393 --> 00:48:16,603
It's going to be a "thing."

631
00:48:17,062 --> 00:48:19,565
Was she the one with the blonde hair?

632
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:24,486
I think I saw her in the elevator.
She seemed totally normal.

633
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:27,155
I'd really like to focus more
on what's going on with you.

634
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:29,908
What was she taking?
It's not what I'm taking, is it?

635
00:48:29,992 --> 00:48:32,244
No. You're taking something else.

636
00:48:33,412 --> 00:48:35,747
You'd... You'd tell me, right?

637
00:48:36,248 --> 00:48:38,875
As part of the Office's
medical conduct review,

638
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:41,670
we'll need to have access
to your charts and records.

639
00:48:41,753 --> 00:48:44,172
Current and past patients.

640
00:48:47,926 --> 00:48:50,596
Absolutely. Whatever you need.

641
00:48:51,597 --> 00:48:55,934
You went to school in the UK, at Durham.

642
00:48:57,102 --> 00:48:59,896
What made you decide
to practice here in the States?

643
00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:04,693
Where I come from,
if anyone goes to see a psychiatrist

644
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:07,446
or takes medication,
the assumption is they're sick.

645
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:09,865
Here, the assumption
is they're getting better.

646
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:11,116
I see.

647
00:49:12,451 --> 00:49:17,122
You first came in contact with Miss Taylor
after a suicide attempt.

648
00:49:18,707 --> 00:49:21,043
She drove her car into a wall.

649
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,962
You decided not to hospitalize her?

650
00:49:26,131 --> 00:49:29,301
She described her suicide attempt
as a mistake.

651
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:33,055
And expressed a desire to get better.

652
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:35,891
Her husband wanted her home as well.

653
00:49:36,016 --> 00:49:40,187
In addition, she had no history
of violent behavior.

654
00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:43,649
Driving a car into a wall isn't violent?

655
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,195
I didn't think she posed
a risk to others.

656
00:49:48,987 --> 00:49:51,156
I saw her regularly,
here in my office,

657
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:53,909
and consulted with her previous doctor as well.

658
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:55,077
Dr. Siebert.

659
00:49:56,161 --> 00:49:57,996
I've spoken to her.

660
00:50:00,082 --> 00:50:03,460
You also do work at the hospital,
a number of shifts.

661
00:50:04,336 --> 00:50:06,004
Sometimes nights.

662
00:50:06,338 --> 00:50:09,508
And you said you're doing
pharmaceutical consulting.

663
00:50:10,342 --> 00:50:12,678
That's a pretty large workload.

664
00:50:14,262 --> 00:50:16,098
My wife lost her job.

665
00:50:16,348 --> 00:50:20,352
And we have a boy, my stepson,
in private school.

666
00:50:21,853 --> 00:50:24,398
I bought a new place downtown, too.

667
00:50:26,942 --> 00:50:32,447
So, longer hours, higher volume of patients,
more stress.

668
00:50:47,045 --> 00:50:48,672
Anything else?

669
00:50:51,883 --> 00:50:54,970
I'll need to ask your partners some questions.

670
00:50:55,053 --> 00:50:56,513
Of course.

671
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:03,145
<i>They can't come after you
for any of this, right?</i>

672
00:51:04,146 --> 00:51:06,481
<i>No, that's not going to happen.</i>

673
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:08,650
They don't blame me.

674
00:51:11,737 --> 00:51:13,905
I'm just an expert witness.

675
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:17,743
Like I was on that case
with the kid from Uganda

676
00:51:17,826 --> 00:51:20,370
who couldn't stop stealing stuff.

677
00:51:22,748 --> 00:51:26,835
They just need me to explain things
to the jury. That's all.

678
00:51:27,753 --> 00:51:30,589
So after the trial, it's over.

679
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:32,424
Absolutely.

680
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,929
<i>She was sad. Very sad.</i>

681
00:51:38,013 --> 00:51:39,347
Every day.

682
00:51:41,016 --> 00:51:42,684
Did she say why?

683
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:46,605
No. It is just how she was.

684
00:51:46,688 --> 00:51:48,064
<i>Some people slip.</i>

685
00:51:49,441 --> 00:51:52,277
Some jump. We keep an eye out.

686
00:51:53,612 --> 00:51:56,948
I remember her. Right on the edge.

687
00:51:58,283 --> 00:51:59,951
She worried me.

688
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:02,621
<i>What makes us human?</i>

689
00:52:02,954 --> 00:52:05,540
What differentiates us from,
let's say, insects,

690
00:52:05,624 --> 00:52:07,709
is that we have consciousness.

691
00:52:07,793 --> 00:52:11,963
An awareness of what we're thinking
and what we're doing.

692
00:52:12,297 --> 00:52:16,968
If, for example, I'm hungry,
I am consciously aware of that.

693
00:52:17,302 --> 00:52:20,889
And so, I go to the fridge
and I make myself a sandwich.

694
00:52:20,972 --> 00:52:24,142
So you intend to make a sandwich.

695
00:52:24,226 --> 00:52:25,393
Yes.

696
00:52:27,479 --> 00:52:31,274
So, what you are saying
is that to have intent,

697
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:32,734
we must also have consciousness.

698
00:52:32,818 --> 00:52:34,694
Objection, Your Honor.

699
00:52:35,153 --> 00:52:38,573
The question calls for a legal conclusion,
not a medical one.

700
00:52:38,657 --> 00:52:39,908
Overruled.

701
00:52:40,325 --> 00:52:41,993
You may continue.

702
00:52:44,162 --> 00:52:46,081
Consciousness provides a context,

703
00:52:46,164 --> 00:52:48,083
or meaning, for our actions.

704
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:50,836
If that part of you doesn't exist, then,

705
00:52:50,919 --> 00:52:53,922
basically, we are functioning
much like an insect,

706
00:52:54,005 --> 00:52:57,259
where you just respond instinctively

707
00:52:57,342 --> 00:52:59,845
without a thought to
what your actions mean.

708
00:52:59,928 --> 00:53:01,680
And that part...

709
00:53:01,763 --> 00:53:04,641
That part that provides
meaning to action,

710
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:06,268
does that exist when we're asleep?

711
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:07,936
- No.
- No.

712
00:53:09,771 --> 00:53:12,607
So, without consciousness,
how do we prove intent?

713
00:53:12,858 --> 00:53:14,693
I don't believe you can.

714
00:53:15,193 --> 00:53:16,444
<i>I think she'll take it.</i>

715
00:53:17,279 --> 00:53:21,283
But she does not walk out of the hospital
next week, or next month.

716
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:23,118
She goes away for a while.
That's part of the deal.

717
00:53:23,201 --> 00:53:24,369
She'll have to agree to that.

718
00:53:24,452 --> 00:53:26,413
You think that'll work?

719
00:53:27,706 --> 00:53:30,750
I can get Dr. Banks to help
explain it to her.

720
00:53:31,376 --> 00:53:34,129
Here's what we're prepared to live with.

721
00:53:34,212 --> 00:53:36,131
State agrees to an NGRI.

722
00:53:36,214 --> 00:53:38,967
We make a side agreement about
how long she's institutionalized

723
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:41,386
before there's any sort of hearing
on her release.

724
00:53:41,887 --> 00:53:44,723
So I'm not guilty,
but I'm still going away?

725
00:53:44,806 --> 00:53:47,726
NGRI means Not Guilty for Reasons of Insanity.

726
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:49,644
You're not guilty of murder.

727
00:53:49,728 --> 00:53:52,439
You'll be moved to the
Wards Island Forensic Psychiatry Center

728
00:53:52,522 --> 00:53:53,565
for a period of time.

729
00:53:53,648 --> 00:53:54,733
But I can't leave.

730
00:53:54,816 --> 00:53:56,526
No, not for a while.

731
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:58,445
You'll be under observation.

732
00:53:58,528 --> 00:54:01,573
I'm not crazy.
You know I'm not crazy.

733
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:06,494
In my opinion, you are a victim
of circumstance and biology.

734
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:09,998
Isn't your opinion the one that counts?

735
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:12,208
No, I'm just one doctor.

736
00:54:12,292 --> 00:54:15,003
It may help to have you examined
by another psychiatrist.

737
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:16,922
We should get Dr. Siebert.

738
00:54:17,005 --> 00:54:19,090
She's known me for a lot longer,
and she could testify.

739
00:54:19,174 --> 00:54:22,928
Dr. Siebert's records have already
been submitted to the D.A.

740
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:26,014
And you weren't in her care
at the time of the murder.

741
00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:31,770
But if I'm just a victim
of circumstance and biology...

742
00:54:33,438 --> 00:54:36,149
It was the Ablixa.
You told me I should stay

743
00:54:36,232 --> 00:54:39,361
on the Ablixa. I would never be here
if it weren't for that.

744
00:54:39,444 --> 00:54:43,448
Emily, if you take this plea,
as soon as a psychiatrist says you're ready,

745
00:54:43,531 --> 00:54:45,075
we'll apply for your release.

746
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:47,118
What if I say no?

747
00:54:48,453 --> 00:54:50,622
Then we keep going.

748
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:54,292
But they have a body,
they have your prints on the murder weapon,

749
00:54:54,376 --> 00:54:55,710
and they have you at the crime scene.

750
00:54:55,794 --> 00:54:58,546
We can't argue that you
didn't do any of that, so,

751
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:01,800
one day, it goes to the jury
and maybe they acquit,

752
00:55:01,883 --> 00:55:03,301
you walk out of here on your own.

753
00:55:03,385 --> 00:55:05,345
Or maybe it goes the other way.

754
00:55:06,388 --> 00:55:08,390
Well, what do you think?

755
00:55:08,974 --> 00:55:10,475
I will tell you what I know.

756
00:55:10,725 --> 00:55:13,770
An NGRI defense is only successful
1% of the time,

757
00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:16,314
and they are giving you that today.

758
00:55:16,398 --> 00:55:17,482
<i>You're fucking kidding me.</i>

759
00:55:17,607 --> 00:55:20,986
Nobody here has ever had a bad result?
Nobody here has had

760
00:55:21,069 --> 00:55:23,154
a client react to a side effect?

761
00:55:23,238 --> 00:55:26,574
Your arrogance here is breathtaking.
You take no responsibility?

762
00:55:26,658 --> 00:55:29,077
For her body's reaction to a medicine?

763
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,412
It only just came on the market!

764
00:55:30,495 --> 00:55:32,872
She has come up in a number
of my sessions as well.

765
00:55:32,956 --> 00:55:34,666
It's become a part of the environment here.

766
00:55:34,749 --> 00:55:36,793
I have clients who are afraid
to take their medications.

767
00:55:36,918 --> 00:55:39,004
We had the state board here.
It's on the nightly news.

768
00:55:39,087 --> 00:55:42,924
Look, I spoke with her lawyer and the D.A.
We worked it out.

769
00:55:43,008 --> 00:55:44,968
She's taking an NGRI.

770
00:55:45,051 --> 00:55:47,554
She's going to hospital for observation.
It's behind us.

771
00:55:47,637 --> 00:55:48,930
It's all gonna go away.

772
00:55:49,014 --> 00:55:51,516
Bullshit, Jon!
It is splashed all over you!

773
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,102
It's going to follow you around forever.

774
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:55,937
And us, too, if we're standing next to you.

775
00:55:56,021 --> 00:55:58,940
What does that mean?
If she's not guilty, why am I?

776
00:55:59,024 --> 00:56:00,650
Rational people may look at it like that,

777
00:56:00,734 --> 00:56:02,902
but we don't see a great
many rational people here.

778
00:56:02,986 --> 00:56:03,987
You can see what I'm saying?

779
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:07,032
We shouldn't even have to ask.
You should see what's happening.

780
00:56:07,115 --> 00:56:09,242
But that seems hard for you!

781
00:56:20,045 --> 00:56:22,130
Do you think I screwed up?

782
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:24,799
I don't know.

783
00:56:27,886 --> 00:56:31,014
I noticed the Taylor woman
in the waiting room.

784
00:56:31,097 --> 00:56:32,640
She was very attractive.

785
00:56:32,891 --> 00:56:35,643
A wounded bird. Fragile.

786
00:56:36,561 --> 00:56:39,397
Would you have treated her differently
if she was a man?

787
00:56:39,481 --> 00:56:40,732
Gene.

788
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:44,069
That's not what happened.

789
00:56:44,736 --> 00:56:47,572
Maybe it's time for you to slow down.

790
00:56:48,073 --> 00:56:50,825
Your client load is down.
Get some cheaper space.

791
00:56:50,909 --> 00:56:52,660
Focus on what's going on with you.

792
00:56:52,744 --> 00:56:54,245
Unbelievable.

793
00:56:55,747 --> 00:56:57,499
I received a letter, Jon.

794
00:56:57,665 --> 00:56:59,084
I haven't shared it with anyone,

795
00:56:59,167 --> 00:57:01,836
but I think it will likely surface.

796
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:03,588
What kind of letter?

797
00:57:06,758 --> 00:57:09,594
It's about Alison Finn.

798
00:57:12,388 --> 00:57:13,890
<i>It was during my residency.</i>

799
00:57:13,973 --> 00:57:16,810
There was a walk-in clinic
at the university.

800
00:57:16,893 --> 00:57:19,312
I saw her maybe three times.

801
00:57:20,355 --> 00:57:21,856
She saw other people there as well,

802
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:25,193
called the suicide line
every other night.

803
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:27,362
She was a paranoid schizophrenic

804
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:30,615
and a drug addict.
Very sick girl.

805
00:57:30,698 --> 00:57:32,075
She knew where you lived.

806
00:57:32,158 --> 00:57:33,159
She stalked me.

807
00:57:33,243 --> 00:57:35,870
The letter says you took her to London.

808
00:57:36,371 --> 00:57:37,622
Never.

809
00:57:38,123 --> 00:57:39,791
Why are they writing this?

810
00:57:39,874 --> 00:57:41,876
Their daughter committed suicide

811
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,879
and left a very graphic note,
naming me.

812
00:57:45,964 --> 00:57:48,633
It never happened. Look.

813
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:52,804
It's not unusual for there
to be emotional transference between

814
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:54,722
a patient and a therapist.

815
00:57:54,806 --> 00:57:57,725
Had her perform oral sex in your car?

816
00:57:57,809 --> 00:58:00,562
Never! It was a fantasy!

817
00:58:54,782 --> 00:58:57,493
<i>Depression can take away your energy.</i>

818
00:58:59,662 --> 00:59:01,998
<i>It can steal away your time.</i>

819
00:59:50,505 --> 00:59:51,881
<i>A number of years ago,</i>

820
00:59:51,965 --> 00:59:53,716
<i>I had a patient
who was having an affair.</i>

821
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,761
Came in here every week
like he was going to confession.

822
00:59:56,844 --> 00:59:59,847
Cried, repented. Didn't stop.

823
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:04,310
Then one day, he comes in
and says it's over.

824
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:08,690
He's finally got a handle on his issues,
like some great epiphany.

825
01:00:09,857 --> 01:00:12,819
It was about six or seven months later

826
01:00:12,902 --> 01:00:17,740
his wife turns up and says he has
a whole other family in another state.

827
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,035
He'd been lying to her.

828
01:00:21,703 --> 01:00:23,496
And he was lying to me.

829
01:00:24,998 --> 01:00:29,335
The kids blamed me. The wife blamed me.
Even the patient blamed me.

830
01:00:30,211 --> 01:00:32,380
At times, I blamed me.

831
01:00:33,881 --> 01:00:39,137
The point is the cardiologist
can see it coming, the heart attack,

832
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:42,473
from the tests. It's in the blood.

833
01:00:43,891 --> 01:00:45,893
But who can see the lies?

834
01:00:46,561 --> 01:00:49,063
Or the past, or the sadness?

835
01:00:53,568 --> 01:00:56,404
You didn't tell me you wrote the article.

836
01:00:57,572 --> 01:01:01,242
We were consulting on a patient,
not comparing rsums.

837
01:01:01,409 --> 01:01:03,953
It would have been a little self-involved

838
01:01:04,037 --> 01:01:05,580
for me to mention it,
don't you think?

839
01:01:06,414 --> 01:01:08,833
It wasn't about me,
it was about Emily.

840
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:12,420
Why didn't you tell me
about the sleepwalking?

841
01:01:12,754 --> 01:01:14,088
Me tell you?

842
01:01:14,589 --> 01:01:16,049
She told you about them.

843
01:01:16,758 --> 01:01:18,509
And you kept her on the Ablixa.

844
01:01:18,593 --> 01:01:20,762
It was a decision you made, Jon.

845
01:01:22,597 --> 01:01:24,140
How did you know that?

846
01:01:24,223 --> 01:01:25,224
Know what?

847
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:31,939
That she had more than one episode.
How would you know that?

848
01:01:33,441 --> 01:01:36,527
Did she have them
when she was your patient?

849
01:01:36,611 --> 01:01:39,113
I know because it's in the news.

850
01:01:39,781 --> 01:01:41,449
That's how I know.

851
01:01:42,617 --> 01:01:44,243
Everyone knows.

852
01:01:45,453 --> 01:01:47,789
Everyone knows everything, Jon.

853
01:01:58,633 --> 01:02:00,510
Like that? At that speed?

854
01:02:00,593 --> 01:02:02,720
- No, faster than that.
- Oh, faster than that.

855
01:02:02,804 --> 01:02:06,182
Yeah, and she was carrying the seat belt.

856
01:02:06,265 --> 01:02:07,809
She was wearing the seat belt?
Are you sure?

857
01:02:07,892 --> 01:02:09,143
Yeah, I saw it!

858
01:02:13,481 --> 01:02:16,818
<i>One moment, you're living high on the hog,
and the next moment,</i>

859
01:02:16,901 --> 01:02:20,238
you're visiting your hubby in jail,
eating ramen?

860
01:02:20,321 --> 01:02:22,407
Who wouldn't be depressed?

861
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:24,826
And then what happened...

862
01:02:24,992 --> 01:02:28,329
Oh, God, it's just so tragic.

863
01:02:29,997 --> 01:02:33,251
I've suffered from my own depression,
so I understand.

864
01:02:33,334 --> 01:02:35,294
I'm sorry to hear that.

865
01:02:36,671 --> 01:02:41,676
"Every afternoon, around 3:00,
like a poisonous fog bank rolling in

866
01:02:42,009 --> 01:02:44,345
"on my mind, and I'm paralyzed."

867
01:02:44,637 --> 01:02:45,930
"A poisonous fog"?

868
01:02:46,055 --> 01:02:48,349
- That's not me. It's William Styron. Yes.
- William Styron.

869
01:02:48,433 --> 01:02:50,101
- <i>Darkness Visible.</i>
- <i>Darkness Visible.</i>

870
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:53,855
<i>There are times when I feel
I could have written it, but...</i>

871
01:02:55,022 --> 01:02:56,649
<i>So is she</i>

872
01:02:56,858 --> 01:02:58,526
doing any better?

873
01:02:59,026 --> 01:03:00,361
I'm keeping an eye on her.

874
01:03:16,335 --> 01:03:18,171
Excuse me. Are you Julia?

875
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:21,215
Julia? Are you Julia?

876
01:03:23,384 --> 01:03:26,304
Sorry to disturb you.
Are you Julia? No.

877
01:03:26,387 --> 01:03:28,139
Julia? Are you Julia?

878
01:03:28,222 --> 01:03:29,724
- No, I'm Joan.
- Julia.

879
01:03:29,849 --> 01:03:31,976
- Is there a... Are you Julia?
- No, I'm Susan.

880
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:33,269
Is there something else?

881
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:36,189
I wanted to speak to her friend, Julia.

882
01:03:36,397 --> 01:03:40,234
Julia? I don't think we have a Julia
that works here.

883
01:03:40,693 --> 01:03:41,903
Really?

884
01:03:43,905 --> 01:03:44,989
Hey.

885
01:03:46,073 --> 01:03:47,575
Look at this.

886
01:03:48,409 --> 01:03:52,288
She knew all about airbags and seat belts.
Fucking commercial runs

887
01:03:52,371 --> 01:03:55,374
on a loop in the lobby
where she works.

888
01:03:58,252 --> 01:03:59,962
- Where were you?
- What?

889
01:04:00,922 --> 01:04:03,090
You forgot me at school.

890
01:04:03,591 --> 01:04:05,593
I was here. I was doing this.

891
01:04:05,676 --> 01:04:08,221
Honey, go to your room. Start your homework.
I'll be there in a minute.

892
01:04:08,304 --> 01:04:09,805
I'm sorry.

893
01:04:11,766 --> 01:04:14,519
What is all this?
The Delatrex thing?

894
01:04:14,602 --> 01:04:16,562
No, look, I went to her office.

895
01:04:16,646 --> 01:04:19,607
There is no Julia at work
who takes Ablixa.

896
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,568
What are you talking about?

897
01:04:22,652 --> 01:04:24,820
Why did she make up Julia?

898
01:04:26,948 --> 01:04:29,784
I don't know. Isn't she sick?

899
01:04:30,451 --> 01:04:33,621
I thought sick people
sometimes make things up.

900
01:04:37,124 --> 01:04:38,334
<i>So you're feeling better.</i>

901
01:04:38,417 --> 01:04:41,729
<i>Yeah, much better.
I've been doing a lot of...</i>

902
01:04:42,255 --> 01:04:46,217
running on the treadmill here to try
and get in shape and stimulate serotonin.

903
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:49,428
You're not feeling like
you're in a "poisonous fog"?

904
01:04:50,263 --> 01:04:51,430
No.

905
01:04:52,139 --> 01:04:53,599
No, not so much anymore.

906
01:04:55,268 --> 01:04:57,812
That phrase really stuck with me.

907
01:04:58,938 --> 01:05:00,314
How did you come by it?

908
01:05:02,775 --> 01:05:04,086
I don't know, really.

909
01:05:05,611 --> 01:05:07,530
I guess it's just...

910
01:05:08,281 --> 01:05:10,575
I guess that's how I felt back then.

911
01:05:10,658 --> 01:05:13,369
You know, maybe I heard it
or read it somewhere.

912
01:05:13,452 --> 01:05:19,000
Back on the boat with Martin,
we used to always see the fog rolling in.

913
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:22,962
I'm sure a lot of depressed people
have felt that way before.

914
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:28,467
The important thing is that I think
the fog is finally lifting.

915
01:05:28,676 --> 01:05:32,680
And I really think I'm going to be ready
to get out of here soon.

916
01:05:37,143 --> 01:05:40,396
I have to go, I'm sorry.
I have a meeting in the city.

917
01:05:41,981 --> 01:05:46,485
Do you think maybe, uh, next time
you could stay a little longer?

918
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:50,156
It's just I don't have
any other visitors

919
01:05:50,656 --> 01:05:53,868
and this is really all I have
to look forward to.

920
01:05:55,161 --> 01:05:57,830
What about your friend, Julia?

921
01:05:59,832 --> 01:06:01,000
Julia?

922
01:06:02,001 --> 01:06:04,003
Yes. From the ad agency.

923
01:06:05,004 --> 01:06:08,674
Oh, Julia.
No, I worked with Julia at the bar.

924
01:06:09,342 --> 01:06:13,179
I haven't heard from her
since everything happened.

925
01:06:14,013 --> 01:06:16,515
I haven't heard from most people.

926
01:06:21,062 --> 01:06:22,188
Are you okay?

927
01:06:25,524 --> 01:06:30,529
I know what it's like to have your
entire life change out from under you.

928
01:06:32,365 --> 01:06:37,036
The only difference is,
you didn't do anything wrong and Martin did.

929
01:06:38,037 --> 01:06:39,622
<i>So, the reason I called.</i>

930
01:06:40,706 --> 01:06:43,167
I mean, with all the attention in the paper
on the Taylor case,

931
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:45,294
and with the ethics probe and such,

932
01:06:45,378 --> 01:06:47,347
I wanted to tell you that...

933
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:51,801
We need to ask you to step off the study.

934
01:06:51,884 --> 01:06:53,511
I'm sure it's all blown
out of proportion,

935
01:06:53,594 --> 01:06:55,680
but we can't have you
on the payroll now.

936
01:06:55,763 --> 01:06:57,682
I could be anonymous.

937
01:06:58,224 --> 01:06:59,892
Still do the work.

938
01:07:00,893 --> 01:07:02,561
I'm real sorry.

939
01:07:02,895 --> 01:07:05,272
I feel horrible about this.

940
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:11,070
Maybe you can be part of another study
when this is over.

941
01:07:11,404 --> 01:07:12,697
All right, then.

942
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:15,408
The funny thing is,
with Sadler-Benelux in the toilet,

943
01:07:15,491 --> 01:07:17,076
we're up like 30%.

944
01:07:17,451 --> 01:07:18,452
What?

945
01:07:18,577 --> 01:07:22,998
The guys down on Wall Street are cashing in
because of what happened with Ablixa.

946
01:07:23,082 --> 01:07:25,251
Worked out super well for us.

947
01:07:25,459 --> 01:07:27,294
<i>You can bet on a stock to go down,</i>

948
01:07:27,378 --> 01:07:29,797
<i>just like you can bet on it
to go up.</i>

949
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,716
A few days before 9/11,

950
01:07:31,799 --> 01:07:36,554
there was a huge surge in the purchase
of options of airline stock.

951
01:07:36,637 --> 01:07:39,181
No one knows why.
It's a complete mystery.

952
01:07:39,265 --> 01:07:42,435
But United fell 40%
after the planes crashed

953
01:07:42,518 --> 01:07:44,353
and people made a lot of money.

954
01:07:44,437 --> 01:07:45,604
And it isn't illegal.

955
01:07:45,688 --> 01:07:48,190
Thinking something's going to happen
isn't illegal.

956
01:07:48,274 --> 01:07:50,693
Breaking the law to make it happen
is a different story.

957
01:07:50,776 --> 01:07:53,904
Jon, I know what insider trading is.
I used to work in finance.

958
01:07:53,988 --> 01:07:56,198
Sure, you do, but, look. See!

959
01:07:57,491 --> 01:08:00,327
Hey. See what happened at Sadler-Benelux

960
01:08:00,411 --> 01:08:02,079
right after Martin Taylor died.

961
01:08:02,163 --> 01:08:04,165
Down. Way down.

962
01:08:04,498 --> 01:08:08,669
AziLyle, on the other hand... up.
Way up.

963
01:08:09,003 --> 01:08:11,881
She did it.
She made it happen, do you see?

964
01:08:11,964 --> 01:08:13,424
Do you see? Ablixa was her idea!

965
01:08:13,507 --> 01:08:16,510
But you prescribed it.
You did that.

966
01:08:20,306 --> 01:08:22,016
I got a job today.

967
01:08:23,951 --> 01:08:26,103
They offered me full time.

968
01:08:26,187 --> 01:08:28,397
I left you a message this morning.

969
01:08:28,481 --> 01:08:31,192
I didn't hear.
My phone was off 'cause I was at the hospital.

970
01:08:31,275 --> 01:08:33,611
Hopefully with this and the consulting money
we can finally get back...

971
01:08:33,694 --> 01:08:37,364
No, the Delatrex thing is over.
It's gone.

972
01:08:38,532 --> 01:08:40,034
They fired me.

973
01:08:41,202 --> 01:08:42,369
What?

974
01:08:43,204 --> 01:08:45,039
- When?
- Today.

975
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:49,376
That's why I have to make
this thing with Emily work.

976
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:52,296
I'm not letting another Alison Finn happen,

977
01:08:52,379 --> 01:08:53,422
so I'm fucking fighting this time!

978
01:08:53,506 --> 01:08:55,424
I don't want to hear about Emily or Alison.

979
01:08:55,508 --> 01:08:56,967
But this is starting to make sense now!

980
01:08:57,051 --> 01:08:59,011
No, it's not making sense!

981
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:03,474
It doesn't make sense that you're sitting here
doing this all day long!

982
01:09:03,557 --> 01:09:05,392
The case is over.

983
01:09:06,352 --> 01:09:09,146
The photographers are gone,
your partners are gone,

984
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:11,732
the Delatrex thing is now gone.

985
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,320
You're the only one that's still here.

986
01:09:16,403 --> 01:09:18,739
I just want to know what happened.

987
01:09:19,573 --> 01:09:22,576
A woman you were treating
killed her husband.

988
01:09:23,911 --> 01:09:25,746
That's what happened.

989
01:09:31,252 --> 01:09:33,212
<i>But I already told the truth.</i>

990
01:09:33,295 --> 01:09:36,131
That's what this test will help to prove.

991
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:37,758
How does it do that?

992
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:40,719
It helps to show your true state of mind.

993
01:09:40,928 --> 01:09:44,765
Sodium amytal gives us a window
into someone's psyche.

994
01:09:45,057 --> 01:09:46,308
It lowers inhibitions.

995
01:09:46,433 --> 01:09:50,104
We make a video of the test
and we show it to the judge.

996
01:09:51,939 --> 01:09:54,525
It's just you know
how I feel about drugs.

997
01:09:54,608 --> 01:09:57,570
Emily, this is the fastest way out of here.

998
01:09:58,779 --> 01:10:00,698
What does it do to me?

999
01:10:00,781 --> 01:10:03,576
Initially, you'll feel light-headed.

1000
01:10:04,118 --> 01:10:08,455
And then you will get a
sense of well-being. Calm.

1001
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:12,543
After a few minutes,
you'll probably get drowsy and fall asleep.

1002
01:10:12,626 --> 01:10:14,336
What do you do while that's happening?

1003
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:15,880
I ask questions.

1004
01:10:15,963 --> 01:10:19,633
You answer. You say whatever you feel
about what happened.

1005
01:10:19,925 --> 01:10:22,678
What motivated you to come
and see me in the first place?

1006
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:25,139
My motivation was to get over my depression

1007
01:10:25,222 --> 01:10:26,891
and to have a life with my husband.

1008
01:10:26,974 --> 01:10:28,893
Then that's what this will show.

1009
01:10:28,976 --> 01:10:31,103
What if I say something else?

1010
01:10:32,813 --> 01:10:34,565
What do you mean?

1011
01:10:35,107 --> 01:10:39,403
I just mean, what if I say something
that makes my situation worse?

1012
01:10:41,113 --> 01:10:45,451
You say anything you're not happy with,
I'll destroy the video.

1013
01:10:50,831 --> 01:10:52,708
How old are you, Emily?

1014
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:54,251
Twenty-eight.

1015
01:10:55,169 --> 01:10:56,712
Where are we?

1016
01:10:57,504 --> 01:11:02,176
Wards Island Psychiatric Forensic Center.

1017
01:11:04,345 --> 01:11:06,680
What is the capital of New York?

1018
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:09,850
Albany.

1019
01:11:11,185 --> 01:11:13,395
Do you know why you're here?

1020
01:11:15,022 --> 01:11:17,191
Because my husband is dead.

1021
01:11:17,524 --> 01:11:19,193
How did he die?

1022
01:11:20,361 --> 01:11:23,864
They said I stabbed him,
but I can't remember.

1023
01:11:25,366 --> 01:11:27,952
Did you want him dead?
Did you kill Martin on purpose?

1024
01:11:28,035 --> 01:11:29,203
No.

1025
01:11:30,496 --> 01:11:34,708
I wanted us to sail away together
on the boat, all three of us.

1026
01:11:35,876 --> 01:11:37,544
The three of you?

1027
01:11:39,004 --> 01:11:40,172
Madeleine.

1028
01:11:40,714 --> 01:11:42,633
What happened to Madeleine?

1029
01:11:43,884 --> 01:11:46,053
I lost her because I was sad

1030
01:11:46,178 --> 01:11:50,015
and she didn't want to stay inside
a sad person anymore.

1031
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:56,563
He gave me so much
and then they took him away.

1032
01:11:56,897 --> 01:11:59,233
I wanted to give him a daughter.

1033
01:12:00,234 --> 01:12:03,445
But you killed him.

1034
01:12:05,072 --> 01:12:07,157
Were you angry with him?
Did you hate him?

1035
01:12:07,241 --> 01:12:11,036
No. I never would have hurt him.
I loved everything about him.

1036
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,772
The way he smelled...

1037
01:12:13,747 --> 01:12:16,625
his hands.
Everything about him, I loved.

1038
01:12:16,709 --> 01:12:18,669
Did you do it for the money?

1039
01:12:18,752 --> 01:12:20,254
Like he did?

1040
01:12:23,257 --> 01:12:24,425
Emily.

1041
01:12:25,926 --> 01:12:28,220
I loved everything about him.

1042
01:12:29,221 --> 01:12:31,015
<i>Emily, can you hear me?</i>

1043
01:12:31,098 --> 01:12:32,099
<i>I can't remember.</i>

1044
01:12:32,182 --> 01:12:34,601
That's what she said in her statement.
She doesn't remember.

1045
01:12:34,685 --> 01:12:35,769
She's lying.

1046
01:12:35,853 --> 01:12:37,604
What does her falling asleep prove?

1047
01:12:37,688 --> 01:12:39,773
You have to destroy this.
You're torturing the poor woman.

1048
01:12:48,615 --> 01:12:49,783
It's saline.

1049
01:12:51,285 --> 01:12:53,203
I gave her saltwater.

1050
01:12:53,287 --> 01:12:54,329
What?

1051
01:12:54,413 --> 01:12:55,831
There was no drug.

1052
01:12:55,956 --> 01:12:58,625
So, why did she pass out?

1053
01:12:59,293 --> 01:13:02,796
You don't put in a performance
like that on saltwater.

1054
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:06,383
Call the hospital.
Order a blood test.

1055
01:13:06,467 --> 01:13:09,470
You won't find any amytal in her system.

1056
01:13:10,304 --> 01:13:12,765
She's been lying this whole time.

1057
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:23,317
Destroy that.

1058
01:13:24,985 --> 01:13:26,028
No. Call the hospital.

1059
01:13:26,695 --> 01:13:28,155
- Order a blood test.
- Not a chance.

1060
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:30,657
- We have her. Arrest her.
- Dr. Banks...

1061
01:13:30,741 --> 01:13:32,034
I want my life back!

1062
01:13:32,117 --> 01:13:33,452
Destroy it before it destroys you.

1063
01:13:33,619 --> 01:13:36,080
She knew the safety features of the car...

1064
01:13:36,163 --> 01:13:38,248
You don't want to say that to me
or to anyone.

1065
01:13:38,373 --> 01:13:40,542
- Another thing. Sadler-Benelux is down.
- Stop talking, Dr. Banks.

1066
01:13:40,667 --> 01:13:42,086
- Stop! It's too late!
- Millions of dollars were made!

1067
01:13:42,169 --> 01:13:44,922
No! You could have worked with us! I asked.

1068
01:13:45,005 --> 01:13:48,342
The verdict's in. It's too fucking late
for whatever that circus is

1069
01:13:48,425 --> 01:13:49,426
that you just showed me.

1070
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:51,637
You see, we can't just start over.

1071
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,889
We have double jeopardy laws in this country.

1072
01:13:53,972 --> 01:13:55,599
Check her bank account.

1073
01:13:55,682 --> 01:13:58,519
We did. We always do. Nothing.

1074
01:13:58,852 --> 01:14:02,397
No insurance policy, no stock holdings,
no inheritance from Martin.

1075
01:14:02,481 --> 01:14:03,482
She's not depressed.

1076
01:14:03,565 --> 01:14:05,692
And you didn't catch it and someone died.

1077
01:14:07,486 --> 01:14:10,781
And I didn't catch it
and someone didn't go to jail.

1078
01:14:10,864 --> 01:14:12,199
We failed.

1079
01:14:13,325 --> 01:14:16,120
See, that's what your little stunt proves.
If it proves anything,

1080
01:14:16,203 --> 01:14:18,205
it proves we got beat.

1081
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:20,958
And that you lied to a woman

1082
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:24,211
who's not guilty about
what you were putting in her arm.

1083
01:14:25,045 --> 01:14:26,630
Now, I don't know how
you feel about that,

1084
01:14:26,713 --> 01:14:29,133
but I would rather it stay
between you and me.

1085
01:14:31,051 --> 01:14:32,803
You were never here.

1086
01:14:33,345 --> 01:14:35,013
<i>Just come out there</i>

1087
01:14:35,222 --> 01:14:38,142
and see her once. Please.

1088
01:14:38,225 --> 01:14:40,060
She wasn't depressed.

1089
01:14:40,394 --> 01:14:42,271
I actually can prove it.

1090
01:14:42,354 --> 01:14:44,106
Why would I examine her now?

1091
01:14:44,189 --> 01:14:46,650
Is that what you wanted to see me about?
Shit, Jon!

1092
01:14:46,733 --> 01:14:49,611
I solved it finally, on my own.
Just come see her.

1093
01:14:49,695 --> 01:14:51,488
You're stuck in some old place, Jon.

1094
01:14:51,572 --> 01:14:53,157
I think you need someone
to help pull you out.

1095
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:56,118
I can refer someone good.
Are you still seeing her?

1096
01:14:56,201 --> 01:14:58,287
I'm consulting.
I'm her expert on this case.

1097
01:14:58,370 --> 01:14:59,788
Well, that has to stop!

1098
01:14:59,872 --> 01:15:03,000
You want to make it go away, you go out to
Wards Island and resign from the case.

1099
01:15:03,083 --> 01:15:04,126
- Step off.
- I can't do that.

1100
01:15:04,209 --> 01:15:06,336
Well, then it's not going to go away.

1101
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:08,964
- Okay, you won't come and see her with me?
- No.

1102
01:15:09,047 --> 01:15:10,424
- Can I ask you something else?
- What?

1103
01:15:10,549 --> 01:15:13,594
Some Adderall.
Just a short term, 20 milligrams.

1104
01:15:14,928 --> 01:15:16,930
- That's why you called, isn't it?
- I'm struggling

1105
01:15:17,055 --> 01:15:20,517
to hold focus here, Gene.
That's what it's for, to help people focus.

1106
01:15:20,601 --> 01:15:21,685
You want to focus on something,

1107
01:15:21,768 --> 01:15:23,562
focus on never seeing her again.

1108
01:15:27,774 --> 01:15:30,152
<i>D, I've been thinking
about what you said.</i>

1109
01:15:30,944 --> 01:15:33,614
Look, you're right.
It's time to move on.

1110
01:15:33,947 --> 01:15:36,116
I'm heading over to Wards Island right now.

1111
01:15:36,283 --> 01:15:38,368
<i>I'm not gonna see her again.</i>

1112
01:15:59,056 --> 01:16:00,891
You went to see Emily.

1113
01:16:00,974 --> 01:16:02,643
Damn right, I did.

1114
01:16:03,894 --> 01:16:05,103
You could have called me first.

1115
01:16:05,187 --> 01:16:06,563
She called me.

1116
01:16:06,647 --> 01:16:08,357
She was very upset.

1117
01:16:08,732 --> 01:16:11,026
It was kind of a dramatic stunt
to pull on a woman

1118
01:16:11,109 --> 01:16:14,196
who's already in a great deal
of emotional pain.

1119
01:16:14,905 --> 01:16:17,407
I don't understand your thinking.

1120
01:16:20,035 --> 01:16:22,579
I'm trying to determine
her state of mind

1121
01:16:22,663 --> 01:16:25,666
so I can chart the best course of treatment.

1122
01:16:25,749 --> 01:16:27,167
"Treatment"?

1123
01:16:27,751 --> 01:16:29,795
You gave an amytal interview to a woman

1124
01:16:29,878 --> 01:16:32,089
who's been declared not guilty.

1125
01:16:32,756 --> 01:16:34,424
I hope you learned something.

1126
01:16:34,508 --> 01:16:35,842
Oh, I did.

1127
01:16:36,426 --> 01:16:38,262
Quite a lot, actually.

1128
01:16:40,013 --> 01:16:42,849
I think she requires more observation.

1129
01:16:42,933 --> 01:16:44,643
And she'll need more medication as well.

1130
01:17:03,537 --> 01:17:07,082
This is Dr. Siebert on Bridge Street.

1131
01:17:07,332 --> 01:17:10,127
I'd like an envelope delivered to Manhattan.

1132
01:17:16,925 --> 01:17:18,010
Hey.

1133
01:17:22,014 --> 01:17:23,598
Where's the little guy?

1134
01:17:25,183 --> 01:17:26,351
Fuck!

1135
01:17:26,727 --> 01:17:28,478
I'm not going to go to the police,

1136
01:17:28,562 --> 01:17:30,564
or whomever one goes to in this situation.

1137
01:17:30,647 --> 01:17:32,774
I'm just going to go away.

1138
01:17:33,525 --> 01:17:35,777
What? Wait! Hey, wait!

1139
01:17:35,861 --> 01:17:37,029
Wait?

1140
01:17:37,696 --> 01:17:40,407
Wait for this to happen again?

1141
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:43,368
Another Alison or Emily?

1142
01:17:46,271 --> 01:17:47,372
See?

1143
01:17:47,706 --> 01:17:50,375
Okay, these prove everything.

1144
01:17:50,542 --> 01:17:52,085
She took these.

1145
01:17:53,378 --> 01:17:56,214
These were sent by a friend of the husband's.

1146
01:17:56,298 --> 01:17:57,341
No, that's not true.

1147
01:17:57,424 --> 01:17:58,892
Stay away from us.

1148
01:18:00,385 --> 01:18:01,595
Wait! Dierdre!

1149
01:18:03,221 --> 01:18:05,974
Dierdre. Dierdre, wait a minute.

1150
01:18:06,058 --> 01:18:08,226
- No, Jon.
- Wait a minute. Hello, love.

1151
01:18:21,698 --> 01:18:24,284
<i>You have two unheard messages.</i>

1152
01:18:24,368 --> 01:18:25,619
<i>First unheard message.</i>

1153
01:18:25,702 --> 01:18:28,705
<i>Yes, Dr. Banks?
This is Jeffrey Childs</i>

1154
01:18:28,789 --> 01:18:31,541
<i>from the Office of Medical Conduct Review.</i>

1155
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:35,670
<i>I have some questions about Alison Finn.
Can you call me at...</i>

1156
01:18:36,797 --> 01:18:38,215
<i>Deleted.</i>

1157
01:18:40,050 --> 01:18:41,885
<i>This is Dr. Siebert.</i>

1158
01:18:42,219 --> 01:18:44,805
<i>I'm sure you've received my latest notes</i>

1159
01:18:44,888 --> 01:18:47,224
<i>concerning the Emily Taylor case by now.</i>

1160
01:18:47,891 --> 01:18:49,851
<i>There is, I think you'll agree,</i>

1161
01:18:49,935 --> 01:18:52,062
<i> a different course of treatment to pursue</i>

1162
01:18:52,145 --> 01:18:55,649
<i>that is in everyone's best interest.</i>

1163
01:18:55,732 --> 01:18:58,402
<i>Maybe we can meet for a coffee? Thanks.</i>

1164
01:18:59,569 --> 01:19:01,446
<i>Saved. End of new messages.</i>

1165
01:19:01,530 --> 01:19:04,574
<i>Check erased messages. Press 1-9.</i>

1166
01:19:05,492 --> 01:19:08,578
<i>You could get national coverage on this.</i>

1167
01:19:09,246 --> 01:19:11,248
"Shrinks fucking patients

1168
01:19:11,331 --> 01:19:14,501
"and manipulating them
into killing their spouses."

1169
01:19:14,584 --> 01:19:16,002
Hot stuff.

1170
01:19:17,254 --> 01:19:20,173
I would say this would ruin your practice.

1171
01:19:20,424 --> 01:19:22,008
But wait.

1172
01:19:22,092 --> 01:19:24,261
You don't have a practice anymore

1173
01:19:24,845 --> 01:19:28,682
or a wife or a kid, I'm betting.

1174
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:32,436
So what else can you lose?

1175
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:36,606
Martha can certainly use those
in a wrongful death suit.

1176
01:19:37,524 --> 01:19:39,359
State revoke your license, yet?

1177
01:19:41,945 --> 01:19:43,947
I always tell my patients,

1178
01:19:44,281 --> 01:19:46,950
"You know what the best predictor
of future behavior is?

1179
01:19:47,951 --> 01:19:49,369
"Past behavior."

1180
01:19:49,703 --> 01:19:52,122
Well, you don't have any more patients.

1181
01:19:52,622 --> 01:19:55,959
The only problem with having
a crazy person for a partner

1182
01:19:56,042 --> 01:19:57,794
is they tend to stay crazy.

1183
01:19:58,545 --> 01:20:00,005
You should know how difficult it is

1184
01:20:00,088 --> 01:20:02,549
to cure a pretty girl
with daddy issues.

1185
01:20:02,632 --> 01:20:05,677
Nice try, Jon. I'm not buying it.

1186
01:20:05,969 --> 01:20:08,305
Spend the fucking money now.

1187
01:20:09,306 --> 01:20:11,641
Because they're coming to take it back.

1188
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:15,979
What are you talking about?

1189
01:20:17,314 --> 01:20:18,815
You could go and ask her.

1190
01:20:19,316 --> 01:20:21,735
Only she asked me to keep you
from seeing her.

1191
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:24,654
She told me everything.

1192
01:20:31,161 --> 01:20:34,164
Everything? No, I'll tell you everything.

1193
01:20:34,247 --> 01:20:36,666
You wouldn't be here
if you had nothing to lose.

1194
01:20:36,917 --> 01:20:40,086
She already got a "not guilty" verdict.
You, on the other hand...

1195
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:42,923
Fuck you! You get her out of there
right now, you hear me?

1196
01:20:43,215 --> 01:20:46,218
You do that and you won't hear
from either one of us again.

1197
01:20:46,510 --> 01:20:48,261
Yeah, you can go back to chatting with

1198
01:20:48,345 --> 01:20:50,430
rich white people about their problems.

1199
01:20:50,597 --> 01:20:53,600
She's cured, as of right now, Jon.

1200
01:20:54,351 --> 01:20:56,686
You're a fucking genius!

1201
01:21:00,941 --> 01:21:04,277
<i>She's been very agitated lately.</i>

1202
01:21:04,361 --> 01:21:07,239
I think it best we restrict her visitors.

1203
01:21:07,614 --> 01:21:11,034
And no phone calls, either,
without notifying me first.

1204
01:21:11,368 --> 01:21:13,620
She's been resisting her medication as well.

1205
01:21:13,995 --> 01:21:16,164
Very confrontational with the staff.

1206
01:21:16,248 --> 01:21:18,041
She seems to be getting worse.

1207
01:21:18,324 --> 01:21:19,876
I was afraid of that.

1208
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,549
That's a mouth guard.

1209
01:21:25,882 --> 01:21:29,386
It stops her smashing her teeth,
biting her tongue off.

1210
01:21:29,636 --> 01:21:32,389
The current lasts for about five seconds.

1211
01:21:34,474 --> 01:21:36,434
They'll have administered a paralytic agent,

1212
01:21:36,518 --> 01:21:38,478
but they put a tourniquet
on the ankle, you see?

1213
01:21:38,728 --> 01:21:41,064
To make sure she is having a seizure.

1214
01:21:42,315 --> 01:21:44,150
Keep your eye on that foot.

1215
01:21:45,402 --> 01:21:48,446
It's actually been shown
to be remarkably effective

1216
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:49,739
for treating severe depression.

1217
01:21:49,823 --> 01:21:52,242
None of the side effects
you get with pills.

1218
01:21:52,325 --> 01:21:55,328
No idea what it might do
to a normal person.

1219
01:21:55,912 --> 01:21:58,373
I also wanted to give you another test.

1220
01:21:58,456 --> 01:22:01,918
A personality inventory.
Just a series of true-or-false questions.

1221
01:22:02,002 --> 01:22:03,753
<i>First saved voice message.</i>

1222
01:22:03,837 --> 01:22:05,714
<i>This is Dr. Siebert.</i>

1223
01:22:05,797 --> 01:22:08,133
<i>I'm sure you've received
my latest notes</i>

1224
01:22:08,216 --> 01:22:10,427
<i>concerning the Emily Taylor case by now.</i>

1225
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:11,761
Not a very subtle tool,

1226
01:22:11,845 --> 01:22:13,513
but the results will be of interest
to the board.

1227
01:22:13,597 --> 01:22:15,557
<i>...a different course of treatment to pursue</i>

1228
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:16,683
<i>that is in everyone's best interest.</i>

1229
01:22:16,850 --> 01:22:18,935
They like hard data to look at.

1230
01:22:19,894 --> 01:22:21,813
Wait. What is she saying?

1231
01:22:22,606 --> 01:22:23,773
Who?

1232
01:22:29,112 --> 01:22:31,281
I don't think you should be
my doctor anymore.

1233
01:22:31,364 --> 01:22:33,450
I think you should resign my case.

1234
01:22:37,203 --> 01:22:39,623
Victoria's paying me way too much for that.

1235
01:22:40,457 --> 01:22:43,126
Out of your share, I assume.

1236
01:22:44,628 --> 01:22:47,380
The shock treatment was her idea.
It damages the memory.

1237
01:22:48,423 --> 01:22:52,510
It's in our best interest
that you start forgetting.

1238
01:22:54,638 --> 01:22:56,890
Are you ready for your treatment, Ms. Taylor?

1239
01:23:01,478 --> 01:23:03,813
Oh, no, I scheduled it for tomorrow.

1240
01:23:14,407 --> 01:23:15,742
I need to use the phone.

1241
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:17,827
You can be next.

1242
01:23:22,499 --> 01:23:24,668
I need to call my lawyer now.

1243
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:28,004
Are you going to be long?

1244
01:23:28,338 --> 01:23:29,673
You going to be long?
I need to use the phone.

1245
01:23:31,675 --> 01:23:34,344
Are you going to be long?
Isn't there a time limit?

1246
01:23:34,427 --> 01:23:36,513
I need to call someone.
My shrink is fucking with me.

1247
01:23:37,555 --> 01:23:38,723
Can you get off now?

1248
01:23:38,932 --> 01:23:41,434
I'm sorry, Mrs. Taylor.
You've been restricted.

1249
01:23:41,685 --> 01:23:43,687
By who? By Dr. Banks?

1250
01:23:43,895 --> 01:23:47,440
He's not my doctor anymore.
He attacked me. He's sick.

1251
01:23:47,857 --> 01:23:49,567
Miss Taylor, you need to step back.

1252
01:23:49,651 --> 01:23:52,737
Get off the phone.
Get off the phone!

1253
01:23:52,862 --> 01:23:55,699
Miss Taylor, you need to relax.

1254
01:23:58,034 --> 01:24:00,537
Get me Dr. Siebert!
This is bullshit!

1255
01:24:00,787 --> 01:24:04,791
I shouldn't even be here! I'm not sick!
Get me Dr. Siebert! No! No!

1256
01:24:04,874 --> 01:24:06,543
Relax! Relax!

1257
01:24:07,335 --> 01:24:09,254
No, I don't want it!
I don't want it!

1258
01:24:10,046 --> 01:24:12,215
Yes. Dr. Siebert?

1259
01:24:12,882 --> 01:24:14,217
Dr. Banks.

1260
01:24:15,719 --> 01:24:19,055
I've been thinking about our last conversation.

1261
01:24:19,389 --> 01:24:20,557
Yes.

1262
01:24:21,391 --> 01:24:23,727
An idea occurred to me.

1263
01:24:25,562 --> 01:24:27,480
Maybe I am a genius.

1264
01:24:42,954 --> 01:24:45,498
Hello there!
Best we don't talk inside, right?

1265
01:24:45,582 --> 01:24:47,000
Talk about what?

1266
01:24:47,167 --> 01:24:49,919
Uh, she wants to go
before the judge this week.

1267
01:24:50,253 --> 01:24:51,921
And what is she going to say?

1268
01:24:52,505 --> 01:24:53,923
Well, it depends.

1269
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:57,177
She could tell a long,
sordid story about her former shrink.

1270
01:24:57,844 --> 01:24:59,971
Suggest the SEC investigate.
The whole story.

1271
01:25:00,054 --> 01:25:02,307
That would make national coverage,
wouldn't it?

1272
01:25:03,933 --> 01:25:05,852
- And what do you get out of it?
- Oh, I don't know.

1273
01:25:06,603 --> 01:25:10,774
Peace of mind.
Like I said, it depends.

1274
01:25:17,197 --> 01:25:18,364
No.

1275
01:25:19,783 --> 01:25:21,284
No, no.

1276
01:25:23,203 --> 01:25:26,539
This will be the last time we speak. Okay?

1277
01:25:27,791 --> 01:25:32,295
You get her released,
and we go back to being strangers.

1278
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:37,217
Unless, of course,
you want to consult on other patients.

1279
01:25:42,806 --> 01:25:43,973
No.

1280
01:26:40,864 --> 01:26:43,700
The staff told me you were having
a difficult time.

1281
01:26:47,370 --> 01:26:49,706
So, I've added medication that will help.

1282
01:27:00,383 --> 01:27:03,303
If I tell you the truth,
do I have to take the pills?

1283
01:27:06,723 --> 01:27:09,893
I won't be able to tell the truth
if I take any more pills.

1284
01:28:42,735 --> 01:28:44,654
<i>Imagine everything you ever wanted</i>

1285
01:28:44,737 --> 01:28:47,156
<i>shows up one day
and calls itself your life.</i>

1286
01:28:48,658 --> 01:28:51,744
<i>And then, just when you start
to believe in it...</i>

1287
01:28:52,745 --> 01:28:55,498
<i>Gone. And suddenly, it gets</i>

1288
01:28:55,581 --> 01:28:58,292
<i>very hard to imagine a future.</i>

1289
01:28:58,918 --> 01:29:01,087
<i>That's depression, right?</i>

1290
01:29:13,599 --> 01:29:15,852
<i>So I went to see Dr. Siebert.</i>

1291
01:29:17,186 --> 01:29:19,063
<i>We talked about my childhood.</i>

1292
01:29:19,147 --> 01:29:22,108
<i>About disappointment and Mommy and Daddy.</i>

1293
01:29:22,692 --> 01:29:24,861
<i>And I told her about Martin.</i>

1294
01:29:25,111 --> 01:29:27,613
<i>And she told me that her marriage
with her husband</i>

1295
01:29:27,697 --> 01:29:30,116
<i>had never been anything
but a meeting of minds.</i>

1296
01:29:31,034 --> 01:29:33,870
<i>And minds start to wander after a while.</i>

1297
01:29:34,871 --> 01:29:38,207
<i>He had traded her in for a younger model,
so she was</i>

1298
01:29:38,541 --> 01:29:41,711
<i>alone and lonely.
It didn't take much.</i>

1299
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:46,215
<i>I think she always liked girls,</i>

1300
01:29:46,299 --> 01:29:48,885
<i>she just never found one
she liked as much as me.</i>

1301
01:29:52,055 --> 01:29:54,223
<i>She taught me how to be depressed.</i>

1302
01:29:55,224 --> 01:29:58,061
<i>What drugs had which side effects.</i>

1303
01:29:58,895 --> 01:30:01,564
<i>What symptoms went with what diagnosis.</i>

1304
01:30:02,565 --> 01:30:03,983
<i>And I taught her everything Martin</i>

1305
01:30:04,067 --> 01:30:06,819
<i>ever told me about derivatives and deals.</i>

1306
01:30:08,071 --> 01:30:10,573
<i>The trades were in her name.
So I forgave Martin.</i>

1307
01:30:11,574 --> 01:30:13,117
<i>I went to visit on the weekends</i>

1308
01:30:13,201 --> 01:30:15,578
<i>and told him that
I would wait for him.</i>

1309
01:30:32,428 --> 01:30:34,430
<i>What do you doctors call faking?</i>

1310
01:30:34,514 --> 01:30:35,723
<i>"Malingering"?</i>

1311
01:30:36,933 --> 01:30:38,601
<i>Such a funny word.</i>

1312
01:30:39,852 --> 01:30:42,814
<i>Girls learn to fake things
at a very early age.</i>

1313
01:30:42,897 --> 01:30:46,359
<i>Probably around the same time
that boys are learning to lie.</i>

1314
01:30:51,697 --> 01:30:55,618
<i>We needed everyone to see how much
I wanted it to work out with us.</i>

1315
01:30:55,701 --> 01:30:57,703
<i>How much I loved my husband.</i>

1316
01:30:58,287 --> 01:31:00,957
<i>And how terribly depressed I was.</i>

1317
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:06,337
<i>When did you decide to kill him?</i>

1318
01:31:06,462 --> 01:31:09,298
<i>It's not a decision
you make just once.</i>

1319
01:31:09,715 --> 01:31:12,260
<i>You make it over and over again,</i>

1320
01:31:12,343 --> 01:31:14,679
<i>every time you look at your life</i>

1321
01:31:14,762 --> 01:31:17,932
<i>and you see the position you're in
and who put you there.</i>

1322
01:31:18,015 --> 01:31:19,809
<i>And it all leads back to him.</i>

1323
01:31:19,892 --> 01:31:23,187
<i>Each and every fucking problem,
every disappointment.</i>

1324
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:25,857
<i>And you think to yourself,</i>

1325
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:29,986
<i>"Maybe if he just goes away,
it'll all get better."</i>

1326
01:31:46,502 --> 01:31:48,629
<i>Everything would have
worked out perfectly</i>

1327
01:31:48,713 --> 01:31:51,174
<i>if you had just disappeared
after the trial</i>

1328
01:31:51,841 --> 01:31:53,676
<i>like you were supposed to.</i>

1329
01:31:54,093 --> 01:31:55,428
<i>Why me?</i>

1330
01:31:56,095 --> 01:31:58,264
Was it because of Alison Finn?

1331
01:31:59,515 --> 01:32:03,186
That was just a happy coincidence.

1332
01:32:03,603 --> 01:32:05,855
A convenient distraction.

1333
01:32:06,522 --> 01:32:07,523
It didn't have to be you.

1334
01:32:07,607 --> 01:32:09,150
It could have been you or anyone else

1335
01:32:09,233 --> 01:32:11,277
who walked into my room
with a prescription pad.

1336
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:15,448
We didn't go looking for you,
we just looked at the world.

1337
01:32:22,371 --> 01:32:24,332
<i>I read somewhere that
there's a difference</i>

1338
01:32:24,415 --> 01:32:26,500
<i>between tears of joy
and tears of rage.</i>

1339
01:32:26,584 --> 01:32:27,960
<i>Is that true?</i>

1340
01:32:28,711 --> 01:32:30,880
<i>It's in the chemistry,
but you can't tell by looking</i>

1341
01:32:30,963 --> 01:32:33,424
<i>they all just look like tears.</i>

1342
01:32:43,476 --> 01:32:47,146
Hello? Hello, I think I need help!
I think my...

1343
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:51,150
My husband's bleeding and I think he's...
I think he's been stabbed

1344
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:54,987
and he's dead. He's dead,
I think he's dead.

1345
01:32:55,321 --> 01:32:58,324
I think he's dead!
You need to send someone!

1346
01:32:58,658 --> 01:32:59,992
Please!

1347
01:33:08,834 --> 01:33:11,671
You never did take the Paxil, did you?

1348
01:33:13,005 --> 01:33:14,173
No.

1349
01:33:14,423 --> 01:33:15,758
Or the Zoloft.

1350
01:33:16,175 --> 01:33:17,343
No.

1351
01:33:17,677 --> 01:33:19,345
Only the Ablixa.

1352
01:33:20,179 --> 01:33:22,348
Didn't really do anything for me.

1353
01:33:26,185 --> 01:33:28,437
So, when did she start paying you?

1354
01:33:35,528 --> 01:33:39,365
She always knew you'd turn on her someday...

1355
01:33:42,868 --> 01:33:44,704
like you did with Martin.

1356
01:33:47,331 --> 01:33:50,835
Past behavior is the best predictor
of future behavior.

1357
01:33:52,336 --> 01:33:54,171
That's what she said about you.

1358
01:33:56,382 --> 01:33:59,677
And how long do you two
plan on keeping me here?

1359
01:34:04,307 --> 01:34:07,643
Why would we ever let you leave?

1360
01:34:09,729 --> 01:34:11,063
Because...

1361
01:34:12,565 --> 01:34:14,734
maybe there's a better deal.

1362
01:34:26,162 --> 01:34:29,665
<i>Over the course of her confinement,
I've come to the conclusion</i>

1363
01:34:29,749 --> 01:34:32,460
<i>with a reasonable degree
of medical certainty</i>

1364
01:34:32,543 --> 01:34:36,589
<i>that Emily Taylor is neither
mentally ill or dangerous</i>

1365
01:34:37,590 --> 01:34:41,052
at this time. I believe
with the proper treatment

1366
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:45,389
she is not a threat to herself or others.

1367
01:34:45,473 --> 01:34:47,975
In my opinion, she's ready to move onto

1368
01:34:48,059 --> 01:34:50,019
the next phase of rehabilitation

1369
01:34:50,102 --> 01:34:52,271
with ongoing supervision, as outlined

1370
01:34:52,855 --> 01:34:55,858
in the outpatient order of conditions.

1371
01:34:56,525 --> 01:35:01,030
The risk of relapse back
into a dangerous mental state is low.

1372
01:35:02,365 --> 01:35:06,118
I've submitted to the court the conditions
under which I believe

1373
01:35:06,202 --> 01:35:09,955
the order of confinement may be rescinded.

1374
01:35:11,123 --> 01:35:13,709
And do you, Ms. Taylor, understand

1375
01:35:13,793 --> 01:35:16,504
that if you violate
the terms of your release,

1376
01:35:16,587 --> 01:35:19,382
I will have to issue
a new order of confinement?

1377
01:35:19,465 --> 01:35:20,883
Yes, Your Honor.

1378
01:35:44,073 --> 01:35:47,076
I text her like 20 times a day.

1379
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:50,746
Zach, you're beginning
to see a pattern, right?

1380
01:35:51,247 --> 01:35:55,418
Everyone leaves.
It's not a pattern, it's a fact.

1381
01:35:55,751 --> 01:35:58,671
And how does this connect
to you being adopted?

1382
01:35:58,963 --> 01:36:00,714
I think it started there.

1383
01:36:01,257 --> 01:36:03,008
And now I'm making it happen.

1384
01:36:03,092 --> 01:36:05,886
You know, I get scared
that people will leave and then

1385
01:36:06,804 --> 01:36:11,392
I, uh, end up making them leave.

1386
01:36:11,475 --> 01:36:14,186
Excuse me, Dr. Siebert,
I think someone wants you.

1387
01:36:17,106 --> 01:36:21,944
Uh, I'm sorry, Zach, this is an emergency.

1388
01:36:22,695 --> 01:36:24,405
We're gonna have to pick this up next time.

1389
01:36:24,488 --> 01:36:26,282
You didn't tell Banks anything, did you?

1390
01:36:26,365 --> 01:36:28,033
Of course not.

1391
01:36:28,993 --> 01:36:31,662
How much did you have to pay him
to get me out?

1392
01:36:31,996 --> 01:36:35,166
It doesn't matter. You're out.
It's taken care of.

1393
01:36:35,499 --> 01:36:37,710
You didn't leave me much choice.

1394
01:36:38,419 --> 01:36:40,921
What did you do with
the rest of the money?

1395
01:36:41,172 --> 01:36:42,840
Two accounts.

1396
01:36:43,174 --> 01:36:45,843
Mine's in Dubai,
yours is in Grand Cayman.

1397
01:36:50,072 --> 01:36:51,148
God.

1398
01:36:53,017 --> 01:36:54,894
Are you sure you didn't tell him
anything else?

1399
01:36:54,977 --> 01:36:56,312
Yes, I'm sure.

1400
01:36:56,395 --> 01:37:00,733
Because there are SEC violations.
Conspiracy to commit murder.

1401
01:37:01,025 --> 01:37:02,568
I'm exposed here.

1402
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:04,028
Yes, you are.

1403
01:37:04,111 --> 01:37:05,696
And I'm vulnerable.

1404
01:37:09,533 --> 01:37:11,535
Oh, God, I missed you.

1405
01:37:15,706 --> 01:37:19,210
You taught me to be such a sad, sad girl.

1406
01:37:21,045 --> 01:37:23,214
Do I look sad now?

1407
01:37:27,718 --> 01:37:29,637
Do you remember the first time?

1408
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:30,804
Yeah.

1409
01:37:30,888 --> 01:37:32,556
Do you remember how wet I made you?

1410
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:33,641
Oh, yeah.

1411
01:37:33,724 --> 01:37:35,559
Do you want to do that again?

1412
01:37:36,310 --> 01:37:37,603
Yeah.

1413
01:37:58,457 --> 01:38:00,292
What the fuck is that?

1414
01:38:00,584 --> 01:38:02,920
You didn't leave me much choice.

1415
01:38:05,089 --> 01:38:06,757
Oh, my God.

1416
01:38:13,097 --> 01:38:15,057
Dr. Siebert, you're under arrest.

1417
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:16,684
You're being charged with conspiracy to

1418
01:38:16,767 --> 01:38:19,103
commit murder and securities fraud.

1419
01:38:49,967 --> 01:38:53,429
...within the next 10 minutes.
I think she's just arrived.

1420
01:38:53,512 --> 01:38:55,014
Yeah, she's here.

1421
01:38:56,682 --> 01:38:58,183
And thank you.

1422
01:39:04,565 --> 01:39:06,609
Here I am. Cured at last.

1423
01:39:06,692 --> 01:39:07,693
You're late.

1424
01:39:07,776 --> 01:39:09,194
How long do I have to stay?

1425
01:39:16,201 --> 01:39:18,203
I'm going to put you on some medication.

1426
01:39:18,862 --> 01:39:19,864
What?

1427
01:39:20,914 --> 01:39:23,250
This is for Thorazine.

1428
01:39:23,834 --> 01:39:26,211
It's a tranquilizer, been around for years.

1429
01:39:26,837 --> 01:39:28,255
You know the people shuffling around

1430
01:39:28,339 --> 01:39:30,924
like zombies with vacant eyes
in the prison ward?

1431
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:32,968
They were on Thorazine.

1432
01:39:34,178 --> 01:39:36,513
So this is for Depakote.

1433
01:39:37,514 --> 01:39:40,017
It'll settle your mood,

1434
01:39:40,351 --> 01:39:41,685
but hair loss

1435
01:39:42,519 --> 01:39:43,854
is a side effect.

1436
01:39:47,358 --> 01:39:48,525
What is this?

1437
01:39:48,734 --> 01:39:50,653
As part of our arrangement,
I'll also be sending you

1438
01:39:50,736 --> 01:39:52,279
to the Gramercy for urine tests

1439
01:39:52,363 --> 01:39:55,491
to make certain you take your meds.
And I'm seeing you again

1440
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:58,577
tomorrow, all right?
Try not to be late.

1441
01:39:58,661 --> 01:40:00,496
Angry people are frequently late.

1442
01:40:00,579 --> 01:40:01,830
This is bullshit!

1443
01:40:01,914 --> 01:40:04,917
You sound angry.
Have you read the court order?

1444
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:07,419
You have to obey the terms of your release.

1445
01:40:07,711 --> 01:40:09,380
Yeah, I'm here.

1446
01:40:09,588 --> 01:40:13,384
Those terms mandate that if I believe
you are a danger in any way

1447
01:40:13,592 --> 01:40:16,387
I need to send you back
to hospital immediately.

1448
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:19,056
If I don't, I'm in violation of the law.

1449
01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:22,601
I got Siebert for you.
I'm a cooperating witness.

1450
01:40:22,726 --> 01:40:25,479
- "Very noncompliant..."
- The deal was I testify against her

1451
01:40:25,604 --> 01:40:27,439
- and I get out.
- "with a history of violence."

1452
01:40:27,523 --> 01:40:29,441
- This isn't out, this is fucked!
- "Dangerous."

1453
01:40:29,608 --> 01:40:32,152
I think this needs a new diagnosis.

1454
01:40:32,236 --> 01:40:34,029
Based on what? What did I do?

1455
01:40:34,113 --> 01:40:35,364
To the question,

1456
01:40:35,447 --> 01:40:38,117
"There are objects and creatures
all around us only I can see,"

1457
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:39,326
you answered, "True."

1458
01:40:39,410 --> 01:40:41,995
- You filled that out!
- Schizoaffective disorder.

1459
01:40:42,079 --> 01:40:43,706
I think I need to send you back.

1460
01:40:49,420 --> 01:40:50,921
Mrs. Taylor!

1461
01:40:55,092 --> 01:40:56,593
Emily Taylor!

1462
01:40:57,594 --> 01:40:59,263
Miss Taylor, stop!

1463
01:41:04,601 --> 01:41:06,437
Central, we have a 330-20.

1464
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:09,106
No, he's lying! He's lying!

1465
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:12,609
I'm not sick, I'm not sick!
I promise I'm not sick!

1466
01:41:12,693 --> 01:41:15,779
He's the sick one!
He just wants the money!

1467
01:41:15,863 --> 01:41:17,865
No, I'm not sick, I promise!

1468
01:41:17,948 --> 01:41:19,908
Don't bring me back,
I don't want to go back!

1469
01:41:19,992 --> 01:41:22,870
I don't want to go back!
I don't want to go back!

1470
01:42:38,362 --> 01:42:40,697
How are you doing today, Emily?

1471
01:42:43,617 --> 01:42:44,952
Better.

1472
01:42:48,247 --> 01:42:49,915
Much better.
