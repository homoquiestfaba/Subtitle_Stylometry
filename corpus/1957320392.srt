We'll face it together.

177
00:10:37,827 --> 00:10:39,963
Because there's no one else
I want to face it with

178
00:10:42,432 --> 00:10:44,769

without you.

this for them.

180

Let's do it right here.

185
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,988
Well, me in the bathroom,
you out there.

186
00:11:06,021 --> 00:11:07,790
Why don't I just come in there?

187
00:11:07,823 --> 00:11:09,092
Or you come out here.

188
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,294
Because we're still going to do
the whole ceremony after this,

189
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:14,997

right now is for us.

Do you Noah, take me, Madison,
to be your lawfully wedded wife,

192

to have and to hold,
to love and to cherish to...

193

194
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:31,749
like, when we had those tacos
from taco truck

195
00:11:31,781 --> 00:11:33,950
and then you made me ride
that rollercoaster

196
00:11:33,983 --> 00:11:36,386
that you said wouldn't be
too intense,

I want to sleep in all day

even if we had plans,

199
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:50,000
to pick up after me
because I hate folding clothes

200
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:52,402

201
00:11:52,434 --> 00:11:57,473
to be okay with me
occasionally making us late

202
00:11:57,506 --> 00:12:00,176

when I'm ready to leave.

To remember what you love
most about me,

204

205
00:12:08,052 --> 00:12:12,422

And do you, Madison, take me,
Noah, with all of my baggage,

209
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:29,139
even though I'm a mama's boy
who thinks he's always right,

210
00:12:29,172 --> 00:12:32,409
promise not to get upset with me
when I pee with the seat down,

211
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:35,513
because I promise that I will
clean it up if I miss.

212

213
00:12:39,515 --> 00:12:41,952

at 70 degrees,

even if that means
you need to get under a blanket,

215
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:48,991

216

for no reason at all,

217
00:12:53,196 --> 00:12:57,334

which I'm not saying

219
00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:00,571
you would do
something like that.

I heard that could happen.

come from two very different worlds.

is they really want to hit that

and that separation between the two.

You want us to talk at each other

- Yes, exactly.

That's exactly we want. So, at this
point, we're trying to figure out

what they're supposed

- Audio.

- What about audio?
- They got a paying gig

250

wouldn't hold them back if one came.

off without giving us any notice.

The bar owner has
changed his mind.

262
00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:53,250
Why?

263
00:14:54,217 --> 00:14:55,686
Maybe he finally read the script

264
00:14:55,718 --> 00:14:58,654
and didn't appreciate his place
being described as

265
00:14:58,688 --> 00:15:03,327
and I quote, "A dive where people go to
get drunk and avoid making eye contact."

266

That was in draft three.

267

We clearly updated the script
to make it a nicer place.

268
00:15:07,997 --> 00:15:10,166
Maybe you should have sent
the more recent version.

269
00:15:11,768 --> 00:15:13,637
Tell him that we will make sure

270
00:15:13,669 --> 00:15:15,338
that the bar's name
isn't mentioned.

00:15:15,371 --> 00:15:17,540

it didn't change his mind.

272
00:15:18,707 --> 00:15:20,043
He can't do this.

273
00:15:20,076 --> 00:15:22,212
We have a signed agreement,
right?

274
00:15:22,245 --> 00:15:24,347
We do, but he's still
kicking us out.

275
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,250
Isn't the signed agreement, isn't
that, like a contract or something?

276
00:15:27,283 --> 00:15:29,318
- Yeah, it is.
- So enforce the contract.

277
00:15:29,351 --> 00:15:32,021
But unless you want to take him
to court right now,

278
00:15:32,054 --> 00:15:35,558
you cannot force him to do
anything he does not want to do.

279
00:15:35,592 --> 00:15:38,028
And you can't actually
take him to court right now,

280

about that.

00:44:43,037 --> 00:44:45,140
No.

709
00:44:45,173 --> 00:44:47,275
I can't believe you got to meet
with the Prime Minister.

710
00:44:47,307 --> 00:44:49,510
That is so cool.

711
00:44:49,543 --> 00:44:51,212
It wasn't that big a deal.

712
00:44:51,246 --> 00:44:53,347
It's not like I had an audience
with the Queen.

713
00:44:53,381 --> 00:44:54,783
True.

714
00:44:54,816 --> 00:44:56,452
Why am I even talking to you?

715
00:44:57,552 --> 00:44:58,754
[CHUCKLES]

716
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:04,793
You know, I'm glad
we're both here tonight.

717
00:45:04,825 --> 00:45:06,827
Why is that?

718
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:09,196
Because it gives me the chance
to say something to you

719
00:45:09,229 --> 00:45:12,066
that I have wanted to say
for a long time.

720
00:45:12,867 --> 00:45:13,901
I'm sorry.

721
00:45:14,968 --> 00:45:16,003
For what?

722
00:45:17,805 --> 00:45:20,374
I was a terrible boyfriend.

723
00:45:20,407 --> 00:45:21,843
Oh, Luke.

724
00:45:22,543 --> 00:45:24,345
Whatever. It's in the past.

725
00:45:24,378 --> 00:45:26,214
No, no.

726
00:45:28,316 --> 00:45:30,318
I look back on the way
I behaved in college

727
00:45:30,351 --> 00:45:31,887
and not just to you.

728
00:45:32,887 --> 00:45:34,523
God, I just cringe.

729
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:40,294
So I'm hoping that
you will accept my apology.

730
00:45:42,363 --> 00:45:43,432
Yeah, of course.

731
00:45:44,566 --> 00:45:45,768
Maddie,

732
00:45:46,601 --> 00:45:47,936
I mean it.

733
00:45:49,403 --> 00:45:52,340
I just wish
you had said that years ago.

734
00:45:55,142 --> 00:45:56,144
You do?

735
00:45:57,412 --> 00:46:01,249
No, I mean, not that I didn't...

736
00:46:01,282 --> 00:46:04,852
Uh, that came out not what I...

737
00:46:04,885 --> 00:46:06,854
how I meant it. Sorry.

738
00:46:06,887 --> 00:46:09,557
CAROL: I just always thought

739
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:12,026
you and I might end up together.

740
00:46:12,059 --> 00:46:13,928
I thought we had more in common.

741
00:46:13,961 --> 00:46:15,530
- Like what?
- [LAUGHS]

742
00:46:17,064 --> 00:46:18,967
I don't know.

743
00:46:18,999 --> 00:46:21,003
- Life experience.
- [CHUCKLES]

744
00:46:22,403 --> 00:46:24,206
Anyway, I interrupted you.

745
00:46:26,474 --> 00:46:28,176
Not much since then.

746
00:46:28,209 --> 00:46:30,477
I've been working
at the university for a while,

747
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:33,881
marketing department,
making videos.

748
00:46:33,914 --> 00:46:36,250
Not exactly the type of work
I set out to do.

749
00:46:37,184 --> 00:46:39,486
Still trying to get
funds together, to...

750
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:41,255
start this film
that I've been working on.

751
00:46:41,289 --> 00:46:42,557
Oh, what's it about?

752
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:45,160
Used to be about
Langston Hughes,

753
00:46:45,193 --> 00:46:49,164
- Mm.
- but it sort of evolved.

754
00:46:49,197 --> 00:46:50,932
And now I found myself
more interested

755
00:46:50,965 --> 00:46:53,133
in writing about
the types of people

756
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:55,469
and situations
that he wrote about.

757
00:46:57,037 --> 00:46:59,073
Anyway, somewhere in there,

758
00:46:59,106 --> 00:47:00,575
ten years passed and...

759
00:47:04,111 --> 00:47:05,180
Ten years.

760
00:47:07,447 --> 00:47:09,116
Madison and I, we've...

761
00:47:10,651 --> 00:47:13,588
we've been through
some stuff together.

762
00:47:13,621 --> 00:47:17,392
Hasn't always been easy,
but we're still standing.

763
00:47:22,262 --> 00:47:23,430
You?

764
00:47:23,463 --> 00:47:26,200
Honestly, I should have known
better from the beginning.

765
00:47:26,934 --> 00:47:28,068
What do you mean?

766
00:47:28,102 --> 00:47:32,107
I mean, we met
in a dive bar downtown.

767
00:47:32,139 --> 00:47:34,375
It's not how great romances
begin, you know.

768
00:47:34,409 --> 00:47:36,378
I don't know, stranger things
have happened.

769
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:39,347
Yeah, but not likely.

770
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:43,684
For example, you guys have been
together for ten years.

771
00:47:43,718 --> 00:47:46,988
I bet you have a great story
about how you met, right?

772
00:47:47,021 --> 00:47:48,923
Don't know if it's
a great story...

773
00:47:48,956 --> 00:47:50,391
I mean, it's a story.

774
00:47:51,224 --> 00:47:53,227
Tell me. Come on.

775
00:47:54,294 --> 00:47:58,166
So, uh, you guys are doing good?

776
00:47:58,198 --> 00:47:59,635
Yeah, yeah, we're, we're good.

777
00:48:02,637 --> 00:48:05,140
Do I detect a little doubt?

778
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:08,310
We had a little fight
on the way over here.

779
00:48:08,843 --> 00:48:09,711
We were running late

780
00:48:09,744 --> 00:48:11,713
because I wasn't finished
getting ready.

781
00:48:11,746 --> 00:48:13,581
Being late drives him crazy.

782
00:48:14,581 --> 00:48:17,084
Seems like a pretty minor thing.

783
00:48:17,117 --> 00:48:19,486
Certainly does to me.

784
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:22,489
So you met him
after you broke up with me

785
00:48:22,523 --> 00:48:23,791
because I was such an asshole.

786
00:48:23,825 --> 00:48:27,162
Noah was one of my best friends
the whole time we were dating.

787
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:29,597
You met him
before we were dating

788
00:48:30,631 --> 00:48:31,499
or during?

789
00:48:31,532 --> 00:48:33,735
I would have to tell you
the whole story

790
00:48:33,767 --> 00:48:36,137
and I know
you don't want to hear that.

791
00:48:36,169 --> 00:48:38,506
No, no, I'm curious.

792
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,010
Annie, my younger sister

793
00:48:42,043 --> 00:48:44,412
told me that she knew this guy

794
00:48:44,445 --> 00:48:46,613
that was a freshman, uh,

795
00:48:46,646 --> 00:48:49,683
that I should meet him,
that he was funny and nice.

796
00:48:49,717 --> 00:48:50,584
I was a lonely freshman

797
00:48:50,617 --> 00:48:52,453
so I was all about
making new friends.

798
00:48:52,486 --> 00:48:55,090
But we'd just never seemed
to cross paths.

799
00:48:55,122 --> 00:48:57,758
Until one day, I had to go
to the Dean's office

800
00:48:57,791 --> 00:49:00,027
'cause I missed
too many arts events.

801
00:49:00,061 --> 00:49:01,496
You remember that requirement
where we had to see

802
00:49:01,528 --> 00:49:03,530
so many plays
or musical events or whatever.

803
00:49:03,564 --> 00:49:06,501
A requirement I was not paying
attention to, whatsoever.

804
00:49:06,534 --> 00:49:08,135
And...

805
00:49:08,168 --> 00:49:09,470
- There she was.
- There he was.

806
00:49:10,738 --> 00:49:12,107
I figured out who he was

807
00:49:12,139 --> 00:49:15,042
because Annie
had described him to me.

808
00:49:15,075 --> 00:49:18,112
I wasn't expecting her
to be so, so pretty

809
00:49:18,146 --> 00:49:20,715
or so down to earth.

810
00:49:20,747 --> 00:49:23,184
CAROL: So you fell for her
right then and there?

811
00:49:24,552 --> 00:49:27,122
[CHUCKLES] No, not at all.

812
00:49:27,155 --> 00:49:30,225
We just kind of clicked
and became really good friends.

813
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:32,694
I loved spending time with him.

814
00:49:32,727 --> 00:49:34,029
We had a blast,

815
00:49:34,061 --> 00:49:36,163
we did everything together.

816
00:49:36,731 --> 00:49:38,499
He was so passionate.

817
00:49:38,532 --> 00:49:43,137
He, he believed art
could change the world.

818
00:49:43,171 --> 00:49:44,473
When she danced...

819
00:49:47,108 --> 00:49:48,476
it inspired me.

820
00:49:48,508 --> 00:49:52,481
But I didn't see him
as boyfriend material at all.

821
00:49:53,247 --> 00:49:54,783
LUKE: Why not?

822
00:49:54,816 --> 00:49:56,751
I don't know. You know how it is

823
00:49:56,784 --> 00:49:59,186
when you're attracted
to someone.

824
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,723
With Noah, he was my friend.

825
00:50:01,756 --> 00:50:03,358
And whatever that thing was

826
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:06,126
that had to click for me
to be attracted to him

827
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,630
just hadn't clicked.

828
00:50:08,662 --> 00:50:11,832
Every time I thought about doing
something, I would call her.

829
00:50:11,865 --> 00:50:14,503
We really were best friends,
but...

830
00:50:16,236 --> 00:50:18,405
something started to change.

831
00:50:18,439 --> 00:50:22,244
It became clear to me that he
wanted more than a friendship.

832
00:50:23,644 --> 00:50:25,380
She was just not interested.

833
00:50:28,381 --> 00:50:33,822
And I did a lot of cheesy stuff
to try to convince her.

834
00:50:33,854 --> 00:50:37,092
He left notes in my car,
for example.

835
00:50:37,124 --> 00:50:39,226
This one time,
I borrowed her car

836
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,595
and I left the CD player queued,

837
00:50:40,628 --> 00:50:42,363
so that when she turned
the car on,

838
00:50:42,396 --> 00:50:44,332
that particular song would play.

839
00:50:44,365 --> 00:50:47,102
And I'm listening
to this song play...

840
00:50:47,135 --> 00:50:50,537
[CHUCKLING] I mean, there's this entire
song about not being able to let go.

841
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:55,342
And I'm thinking,
"This is going to be a problem."

842
00:50:55,376 --> 00:50:57,812
I mean, I told myself,
"I'll get over it."

843
00:50:57,845 --> 00:50:59,581
"She's my best friend
and I'll get over it."

844
00:51:00,648 --> 00:51:03,151
But he couldn't.

845
00:51:03,184 --> 00:51:06,187
I felt like I was hurting him
being around him.

846
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:08,457
And just like that,
we stopped hanging out altogether.

847
00:51:09,423 --> 00:51:10,425
I cut it off.

848
00:51:15,762 --> 00:51:20,200
A year and a half goes by
and I finally got over her.

849
00:51:20,233 --> 00:51:22,669
And I started seeing you,
focused more on school

850
00:51:22,702 --> 00:51:26,273
and I just moved on.

851
00:51:26,307 --> 00:51:29,511
And, one night, I'm having some
friends over to watch a movie

852
00:51:29,543 --> 00:51:32,146
and he was with them.

853
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:35,817
By this point, we hadn't
spoken in probably over a year.

854
00:51:35,849 --> 00:51:40,421
So, yeah, kinda awkward,
you know, but... [LAUGHS]

855
00:51:42,423 --> 00:51:43,825
We talked the entire night.

856
00:51:45,226 --> 00:51:46,461
I don't remember
what we talked about.

857
00:51:46,494 --> 00:51:50,164
Just caught up on
what we missed, I guess.

858
00:51:52,265 --> 00:51:57,872
I remember new feelings
swirling around.

859
00:51:59,874 --> 00:52:02,577
I didn't know
what I was feeling, really.

860
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:04,711
But, now I'm just
thinking to myself,

861
00:52:04,744 --> 00:52:07,948
"Do not get feelings
for her, again. Just don't."

862
00:52:07,981 --> 00:52:10,351
[CHUCKLES] But I could tell
it was happening.

863
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,254
And I wake up
later in the day

864
00:52:13,287 --> 00:52:16,691
and I'm going over this in my mind.
I'm thinking, I'm like,

865
00:52:16,724 --> 00:52:19,727
"I'm pretty sure she was
giving me some signals."

866
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,631
But after everything that has
happened, I do not trust myself.

867
00:52:23,664 --> 00:52:27,602
The phone rings and it's him.

868
00:52:27,635 --> 00:52:30,972
And he asked me if I want
to get a bite to eat sometime.

869
00:52:31,005 --> 00:52:32,573
Dinner and a movie, maybe.

870
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:35,944
I said, "Yeah, sure."

871
00:52:35,977 --> 00:52:37,979
And he says,
"Just to be clear..."

872
00:52:38,012 --> 00:52:41,849
"I'm kind of thinking
of this as, an actual date."

873
00:52:41,881 --> 00:52:43,584
Me too.

874
00:52:43,617 --> 00:52:45,719
We went out that weekend and...

875
00:52:45,753 --> 00:52:49,957
And I fell in love with him
within a few weeks.

876
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:52,626
We got engaged
a couple of months later.

877
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:55,697
And we've been
together ever since.

878
00:52:55,729 --> 00:52:59,200
Through good times and bad.

879
00:52:59,867 --> 00:53:01,769
CAROL: See, I told you.

880
00:53:02,702 --> 00:53:03,737
What?

881
00:53:03,771 --> 00:53:05,539
Great couples
have great stories.

882

My mom and sister
are here for me.

1218
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:03,903
Yeah, but eventually
you'd be the one to take over.

1219
01:13:05,205 --> 01:13:07,174
That's always been your place
in your family.

1220
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:10,544
You're the one that makes sure
things get done.

1221
01:13:12,478 --> 01:13:13,646
[SOFTLY] Hmm, thanks.

1222
01:13:14,613 --> 01:13:15,715
You're welcome.

1223
01:13:24,924 --> 01:13:25,926
How's work?

1224
01:13:27,259 --> 01:13:28,461
It's good.

1225
01:13:29,929 --> 01:13:32,065
We added two more
studio locations

1226
01:13:32,098 --> 01:13:33,900
to handle
all the new students.

1227
01:13:33,933 --> 01:13:35,202
Yeah, I heard.

1228
01:13:35,235 --> 01:13:36,737
Really? From who?

1229
01:13:38,838 --> 01:13:40,006
I looked online.

1230
01:13:41,741 --> 01:13:42,776
MADISON: Hmm.

1231
01:13:45,644 --> 01:13:48,915
How about you?
Are you still working on your film?

1232
01:13:50,616 --> 01:13:53,486
Yeah. I'm trying, um...

1233
01:13:53,519 --> 01:13:55,522
Waiting on this producer
to get back to us.

1234
01:13:57,089 --> 01:14:00,860
Gabe thinks there's still hope,
but I don't know.

1235
01:14:03,763 --> 01:14:04,765
And how's work?

1236
01:14:05,932 --> 01:14:07,568
Work is work, you know?

1237
01:14:09,602 --> 01:14:12,738
There's potential for me to make
creative director at the agency.

1238
01:14:12,772 --> 01:14:14,674
- Wow!
- Yeah.

1239
01:14:14,706 --> 01:14:16,610
At least, this is
how I feel today.

1240
01:14:16,643 --> 01:14:20,213
- You ask me tomorrow, and I'll be an insecure mess.
- [CHUCKLES SOFTLY]

1241
01:14:20,245 --> 01:14:21,981
- It's pretty common, actually.
- Yeah.

1242
01:14:23,816 --> 01:14:25,818
- Well, I'm glad to hear it.
- Hmm.

1243
01:14:25,852 --> 01:14:28,220
- Not the insecure mess part, but
- Mm-hmm.

1244
01:14:28,254 --> 01:14:29,890
- The rest of it. [CHUCKLES]
- Yeah.

1245
01:14:35,327 --> 01:14:36,862
[WHISPERING] Now's the part
where you ask me

1246
01:14:36,896 --> 01:14:40,066
if I feel like I settled
by going into marketing.

1247
01:14:40,098 --> 01:14:42,635
- Do you feel like...
- Don't actually ask me that. [LAUGHS]

1248
01:14:42,669 --> 01:14:43,836
What?

1249
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:45,606
It's rhetorical.
I don't want to answer that.

1250
01:14:56,982 --> 01:14:58,584
Had you talked
to your dad lately?

1251
01:15:00,586 --> 01:15:02,289
I had called him
on Father's Day.

1252
01:15:04,323 --> 01:15:08,061
We didn't talk long 'cause
he wasn't feeling very well.

1253
01:15:08,094 --> 01:15:10,130
I don't remember
what we talked about.

1254
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:14,166
All I can remember
are his last words.

1255
01:15:15,802 --> 01:15:18,071
Ernie, gotta go.

1256
01:15:19,272 --> 01:15:21,707
Mom needs my help
in the kitchen.

1257
01:15:22,808 --> 01:15:23,876
Ernie?

1258
01:15:24,811 --> 01:15:26,112
Yeah. That's my boy name.

1259
01:15:26,144 --> 01:15:27,714
Did I never tell you that?

1260
01:15:27,746 --> 01:15:29,081
Your boy name?

1261
01:15:29,115 --> 01:15:32,352
Yeah. That's the name they were
gonna call me if I was a boy.

1262
01:15:32,384 --> 01:15:33,686
- Ernie?
- Yeah.

1263
01:15:33,719 --> 01:15:34,954
[LAUGHS]

1264
01:15:34,987 --> 01:15:36,121
What?

1265
01:15:36,155 --> 01:15:38,058
Nothing.

1266
01:15:38,090 --> 01:15:39,992
Let's just be
glad I'm a girl.

1267
01:15:40,026 --> 01:15:41,327
Yeah, I certainly am.

1268
01:15:41,361 --> 01:15:42,563
[CHUCKLES]

1269
01:15:43,396 --> 01:15:44,664
Do you have
a girl name?

1270
01:15:44,696 --> 01:15:45,698
I don't know.

1271
01:15:46,665 --> 01:15:48,034
I never asked.

1272
01:15:48,067 --> 01:15:49,102
Hmm.

1273
01:15:53,406 --> 01:15:55,008
What are you doing?

1274
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,175
I'm asking.

1275
01:15:56,209 --> 01:15:57,277
Now?

1276
01:15:57,309 --> 01:15:58,579
Mm-hmm.

1277
01:15:59,277 --> 01:16:00,981
[SIGHS]

1278
01:16:01,013 --> 01:16:02,682
Uh-oh, she's responded.

1279
01:16:05,284 --> 01:16:06,620
Noelle.

1280
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,288
Noelle.

1281
01:16:09,321 --> 01:16:10,590
Noah.

1282
01:16:11,424 --> 01:16:12,659
Creative.

1283
01:16:12,692 --> 01:16:13,727
Consistent.

1284
01:16:21,299 --> 01:16:24,803
Whenever he called me Ernie,
it was like...

1285
01:16:24,836 --> 01:16:26,839
something we
shared between us,

1286
01:16:28,006 --> 01:16:31,077
like something
only for us.

1287
01:16:35,281 --> 01:16:39,086
He could be so
loving and kind.

1288
01:16:41,888 --> 01:16:45,659
And he'd turn around
and treat you like you're dead

1289
01:16:45,692 --> 01:16:48,061
or yell at Mom for a mess
he had to clean up.

1290
01:16:57,937 --> 01:16:59,906
And we...

1291
01:16:59,938 --> 01:17:01,674
we raise our parents
up in our minds

1292
01:17:01,707 --> 01:17:03,977
to be these... these icons.

1293
01:17:06,179 --> 01:17:07,648
It's never that simple.

1294
01:17:08,714 --> 01:17:11,684
They're human beings
just like us,

1295
01:17:11,718 --> 01:17:14,187
and we have to love them
in spite of their flaws.

1296
01:17:18,758 --> 01:17:21,228
It's kind of what they do with
us, when you think about it.

1297
01:17:22,961 --> 01:17:26,700
Coming from the guy
whose dad wasn't sort of racist.

1298
01:17:27,299 --> 01:17:28,735
That's true.

1299
01:17:28,768 --> 01:17:30,904
That is true.
I do have perfect parents.

1300
01:17:30,937 --> 01:17:33,238
- [LAUGHS]
- It's probably why I'm so wise.

1301
01:17:33,272 --> 01:17:34,741
- Jerk.
- [CHUCKLES]

1302
01:17:49,121 --> 01:17:50,923
What happened to us?

1303
01:18:42,275 --> 01:18:44,076
- Madison... Madison...
- Wh-what...

1304
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:45,245
I can't... I can't.

1305
01:18:45,277 --> 01:18:46,945
Well, why?

1306
01:18:46,978 --> 01:18:48,347
Have you been
with anyone else?

1307
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:50,082
No. No.

1308
01:18:50,116 --> 01:18:51,151
Have you?

1309
01:18:51,183 --> 01:18:54,387
No, of course not.
We're still technically married.

1310
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:55,922
Right. [CHUCKLES]

1311
01:18:56,388 --> 01:18:58,223
I just...

1312
01:18:58,256 --> 01:19:01,294
[SIGHS] I don't want
to complicate things.

1313
01:19:01,326 --> 01:19:02,594
You and... You and I,

1314
01:19:02,629 --> 01:19:05,098
we've never really worked
through any of our issues, and...

1315
01:19:06,598 --> 01:19:08,802
I don't... I don't want
to be that guy.

1316
01:19:08,835 --> 01:19:10,270
What guy?

1317
01:19:11,237 --> 01:19:13,540
Your father died.

1318
01:19:13,572 --> 01:19:15,508
And I don't want to be the kind
that takes advantage.

1319
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:17,110
You're not
taking advantage.

1320
01:19:17,143 --> 01:19:20,013
I'm the aggressor here.

1321
01:19:20,045 --> 01:19:22,281
It doesn't make it
any better.

1322
01:19:22,314 --> 01:19:23,348
Actually, it kind of makes

1323
01:19:23,381 --> 01:19:24,416
- my point for me.
- Noah.

1324
01:19:26,885 --> 01:19:28,854
You came here
to help me.

1325
01:19:30,622 --> 01:19:32,224
This is what I want.

1326
01:19:33,491 --> 01:19:36,362
This is what
I need right now.

1327
01:19:38,330 --> 01:19:41,034
I need to get lost in you
for a little while.

1328
01:19:42,934 --> 01:19:44,804
Forget all that stuff.

1329
01:19:47,973 --> 01:19:49,008
Are you sure?

1330
01:19:51,911 --> 01:19:54,080
Stop being so whiny.

1331
01:19:55,147 --> 01:19:56,850
It's killing my mood.

1332
01:20:08,294 --> 01:20:09,329
Thank you.

1333
01:20:11,097 --> 01:20:12,599
One thing real quick.

1334
01:20:12,631 --> 01:20:13,599
What?

1335
01:20:13,633 --> 01:20:15,934
Do you mind just going.
um, to the bathroom

1336
01:20:15,968 --> 01:20:17,470
and brushing your teeth,

1337
01:20:17,503 --> 01:20:20,072
or using a mouthwash
or something?

1338
01:20:20,106 --> 01:20:21,974
Why?

1339
01:20:22,008 --> 01:20:25,111
You just... You taste like
that beer you've been drinking.

1340
01:20:25,143 --> 01:20:27,313
You know I hate
the taste of beer.

1341
01:20:28,113 --> 01:20:29,549
[SCOFFS] Yeah.

1342
01:20:29,581 --> 01:20:31,284
No, really.

1343
01:20:31,317 --> 01:20:33,920
I feel like I picked you up
in a bar.

1344
01:20:36,022 --> 01:20:37,057
Please.

1345
01:20:38,323 --> 01:20:39,326
Okay.

1346
01:20:40,558 --> 01:20:41,960
Yeah.
Sure.

1347
01:20:41,994 --> 01:20:43,196
Thank you.

1348
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:33,280
All right.
All minty fresh.

1349
01:21:39,317 --> 01:21:40,387
Um...

1350
01:21:41,387 --> 01:21:42,956
Um, maybe...

1351
01:21:43,990 --> 01:21:45,090
Maybe you're right.

1352
01:21:46,759 --> 01:21:48,194
Well, of course.

1353
01:21:52,263 --> 01:21:53,298
I should go.

1354
01:21:53,331 --> 01:21:55,434
No, no. Please. Please don't.

1355
01:21:55,468 --> 01:21:57,670
Maddy, I...
I can't stay here.

1356
01:21:57,702 --> 01:21:59,004
Please.

1357
01:22:03,275 --> 01:22:05,978
I'll stay until you fall asleep.

1358
01:22:06,012 --> 01:22:07,080
Okay.

1359
01:23:07,372 --> 01:23:08,707
So let's hear it.

1360
01:23:10,241 --> 01:23:11,276
Let's hear what?

1361
01:23:11,844 --> 01:23:13,079
Your pitch.

1362
01:23:14,345 --> 01:23:15,381
My pitch?

1363
01:23:17,849 --> 01:23:19,485
You obviously planned
everything here

1364
01:23:19,518 --> 01:23:21,521
to try to convince me
not to go through with it.

1365
01:23:23,488 --> 01:23:25,290
So go ahead.

1366
01:23:27,559 --> 01:23:28,727
Nah.

1367
01:23:30,728 --> 01:23:31,764
"Nah?"

1368
01:23:33,365 --> 01:23:34,601
What does that mean?

1369
01:23:37,369 --> 01:23:39,171
Just... nah.

1370
01:23:43,875 --> 01:23:45,577
So I mean
nothing to you?

1371
01:23:47,146 --> 01:23:48,814
Maddie, I didn't
want to meet here

1372
01:23:48,848 --> 01:23:50,383
to try to convince you.

1373
01:23:51,616 --> 01:23:53,251
There are no
magic words I can say

1374
01:23:53,285 --> 01:23:55,155
that'll turn back time
and change things.

1375
01:23:57,188 --> 01:23:58,590
We were married long
enough for me to know

1376
01:23:58,624 --> 01:24:01,294
that the only thing that
convinces you are my actions.

1377
01:24:02,728 --> 01:24:05,531
My actions were
screwed up enough that

1378
01:24:05,563 --> 01:24:07,299
I can't change them
with words.

1379
01:24:09,602 --> 01:24:11,171
I used to think that.

1380
01:24:13,238 --> 01:24:15,340
But now I know
it's all just a fantasy.

1381
01:24:18,210 --> 01:24:20,713
[SIGHS] It's not how
real people deal with life.

1382
01:24:26,384 --> 01:24:28,353
Honestly, I just...

1383
01:24:28,387 --> 01:24:30,523
I just wanted to meet here
because it reminds me of

1384
01:24:31,756 --> 01:24:33,093
how we felt

1385
01:24:35,193 --> 01:24:36,463
the day
we said "I do."

1386
01:24:43,936 --> 01:24:46,171
I haven't felt that
in a long time.

1387
01:24:48,439 --> 01:24:51,277
and I thought maybe
being here with you,

1388
01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:54,379
I might feel that again.

1389
01:24:55,281 --> 01:24:56,515
Just a little.

1390
01:24:59,919 --> 01:25:01,121
And, yeah,

1391
01:25:02,521 --> 01:25:05,625
I thought we both might
feel it a little.

1392
01:25:09,260 --> 01:25:10,263
