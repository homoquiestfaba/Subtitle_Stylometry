1
00:00:33,804 --> 00:00:35,804
Ok, guys.
All right, talent is moving. Here we go.

2
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:44,016
How you doing man?

3
00:00:45,535 --> 00:00:47,920
You feel good?

4
00:00:49,244 --> 00:00:52,244
A little nervous.

5
00:00:54,796 --> 00:00:55,996
Aw, come on. Come on.

6
00:00:56,907 --> 00:00:58,997
Here's the brush.
Just a little bit. Ok.

7
00:00:58,998 --> 00:01:00,998
All right guys. Love you.

8
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:02,999
All right. take it easy. Packed.

9
00:01:04,061 --> 00:01:06,061
Is it?
Yeah.

10
00:01:08,388 --> 00:01:09,588
Don't worry. You're gonna be great. You're gonna be great.

11
00:01:10,595 --> 00:01:11,795
Oh, my God.

12
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:15,951
Here we go.

13
00:01:50,407 --> 00:01:51,607
Let's do it.

14
00:05:14,228 --> 00:05:17,652
To say I know JD McQueen is both an understatement and an overstatement.

15
00:05:18,312 --> 00:05:22,703
I know everything about him. Born december 7. Favorite color red.

16
00:05:23,338 --> 00:05:26,359
youngest solo artist to have sixtten top forty hits.

17
00:05:27,097 --> 00:05:28,888
I could go on and on.

18
00:05:31,744 --> 00:05:34,456
But I don't actually know him.
I've never even seen him.

19
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,969
To me, he's a poster, an autograph, a CD.

20
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,313
It's like he's not a real person cause he's too...perfect.

21
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:46,051
Real people have real problems.

22
00:05:51,694 --> 00:05:53,966
My biggest problem is smart kids aren't cool.

23
00:05:54,433 --> 00:05:55,767
It's a universal truth.

24
00:05:57,535 --> 00:05:59,400
They're the geeks of the high school class system.

25
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:38,405
What' up, London?
Arigato,Tokyo!

26
00:06:38,867 --> 00:06:43,883
Frankfurt, let me hear you scream as loud as you can!

27
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,748
Honney, lose the gum.

28
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,453
Hey, J.D.?
Wake up, man.

29
00:07:09,454 --> 00:07:12,845
Oh, what's up?
The tour is done.

30
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:15,608
The album's a hit.
The single's top ten.

31
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:18,609
That should make the record company happy, right?

32
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,910
We're home.

33
00:07:24,706 --> 00:07:26,547
But this is where I spend most of my time.

34
00:07:29,753 --> 00:07:31,565
And this is where I work.

35
00:07:33,316 --> 00:07:36,577
The  Commence.
Hey, Harv.

36
00:07:36,578 --> 00:07:39,400
Hey  Henrietta.
Hi, kiddo. What's the good word?

37
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:42,852
Uh, school, I guess.

38
00:07:43,924 --> 00:07:46,790
Huh. School. Ha ha ha.
When I was your age that would've been the last thing I said.

39
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,091
That's for sure.

40
00:07:52,654 --> 00:07:54,527
And this is my best friend Abby.

41
00:07:54,993 --> 00:07:57,042
What's up, Jane?
She sees the good in everything.

42
00:07:57,043 --> 00:08:01,371
So, how's the "Abby wants a car fund"?

43
00:08:01,372 --> 00:08:04,425
Not too good. What'd your parents say?

44
00:08:04,426 --> 00:08:08,955
My dad says that if I can get a car he'll pay for the insurance which means that I need to find a car for $ 411,77.

45
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:19,582
You hear that some super freak got a perfect score on their S.A.T?

46
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,320
Yeah. What a geek.
Probably some total loser with no life.

47
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:31,958
Sounds pretty accurate.
You're not a loser and you have a life.

48
00:08:33,238 --> 00:08:36,559
I know-- a boring one.

49
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:50,008
Yo, Joe Cool, we need to talk

50
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,109
Now.

51
00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:57,911
Timmy, go do your homework.
You have no idea how much that school for gifted geeks sucks.

52
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:02,767
Homework, now.
J.D,tell her to let me go to a regular school.

53
00:09:06,117 --> 00:09:10,811
Speaking of regular school I've decided to revoke your privilege of being home schooled for one teeny, tiny reason.
You're failing.

54
00:09:11,411 --> 00:09:12,812
So what? I'm a pop star!!

55
00:09:14,394 --> 00:09:17,154
No more special treatment.

56
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:22,920
You are gonna be a normal kid at a normal high school.

57
00:09:22,921 --> 00:09:25,799
You can't send me to a public school, mom! I'm a celebrity!

58
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,042
Ooh! Wll, it's done... and if you don't pass, it means summer school.

59
00:09:30,043 --> 00:09:32,562
And that means no summer tour.

60
00:09:33,732 --> 00:09:36,285
No. No way. I'm just gonna go live with Dad in New York.

61
00:09:36,286 --> 00:09:39,134
Oh, really? Well, for once he and I actually agree on something.

62
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:43,960
Look, we're both worried  about how things could turn out for you, Joey.

63
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:48,986
You guys are watching way too much "Behind the music."
Oh, you don't even want to know how bad it can get.

64
00:09:48,987 --> 00:09:52,786
Grant, what are you doing here?
Well, your mom called and asked me to stop by.

65
00:09:52,787 --> 00:09:57,290
Will you tell her not to do this to me, please?
Hey, I'm your manager, not your parent.

66
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,460
Besides, I think she's doing the right thing.
Think about your fans.

67
00:10:01,262 --> 00:10:05,237
You're a role model to thousands of kids.

68
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:09,268
Yeah, and for once, try to think about your future.
Think about the great publicity.

69
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:19,756
How you expect to write a whole novel if you can't finish page one?

70
00:10:20,394 --> 00:10:23,200
I wonder if Jane Austen had this much trouble.

71
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:28,020
Write about yourself.
Who would want to read about me?

72
00:10:29,465 --> 00:10:33,691
Who would want to be me?
Well, then write a scary story.

73
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:37,692
You're still afraid of the dark.
I'm not.
Are, too.

74
00:10:37,693 --> 00:10:41,725
Besides, I like romantic stories.
Well, you've never even had a boyfriend.

75
00:10:42,171 --> 00:10:47,788
I'm waiting for the perfect match.
I am so tired of that perfect match stuff.

76
00:10:48,321 --> 00:10:54,108
A relationship with anyone other than your perfect match is bound to end in heartche. I mean, look at my sister.

77
00:10:54,508 --> 00:10:57,213
Ever since Tommy broke up with her she hasn't come out of her room.

78
00:10:57,214 --> 00:11:01,731
She was stood up at the altar on her wedding day in front of everybody she knows.

79
00:11:02,805 --> 00:11:09,315
She should've waited for her perfect match.

80
00:11:09,316 --> 00:11:13,606
Mr. Perfect could walt through that door right now and you'd start quizzing him on the Pythagorean theorem or whatever.

81
00:11:17,454 --> 00:11:19,454
Jane,you need to lighten up.

82
00:11:26,571 --> 00:11:28,571
I think he's cute.

83
00:11:41,204 --> 00:11:44,437
Well, oops, I guess.
Haha! Brain freak.

84
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,529
Whatever! Come on.
Ha Ha! Oh, my God. Oh.

85
00:13:17,271 --> 00:13:18,471
Welcome to calculus, Mr. McQueen.

86
00:13:58,242 --> 00:13:59,834
This is a testing  so please choose a seat, and you can study quietly.

87
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:03,873
Are you all right?
No. I just hate tests.

88
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:18,221
All right, pencils down. Please leave your tests face down on your desks as you leave.
Kevin, would you see me after class?

89
00:14:26,452 --> 00:14:29,145
You know my rule-- cheaters don't get second chances.
J.D, will you relax?

90
00:14:42,592 --> 00:14:45,707
You just need some help with your school work.
Come on.

91
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,888
You don't understand. I've had tutors. They don't help me.

92
00:14:50,434 --> 00:14:53,489
No,no, no. I'm not talking about a tutor -- like, an assistant.

93
00:14:54,131 --> 00:14:57,389
Find the smartest girl in school and ask her to help you out.

94
00:14:58,193 --> 00:15:00,956
You're saying I should hook up with a smart girl and cheat off her?

95
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:05,702
No, I'm saying it takes someone in high school to help you with high school.

96
00:15:06,648 --> 00:15:11,049
Now, I gotta go and meet this new genius at the record label and you gotta get back to school, all right?

97
00:15:11,623 --> 00:15:13,967
All right, man. I'll catch you later.
All right, man.

98
00:15:25,887 --> 00:15:27,087
Do your job.
Take care.
See you.

99
00:15:32,188 --> 00:15:34,461
He's even cuter in person.
I hope he doesn't run for student body president.

100
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,491
Pop rock wuss.

101
00:15:43,463 --> 00:15:44,663
Oh, he's totally dateble.

102
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:52,035
If he hits on my girlfriend, she'll dump me.

103
00:16:09,277 --> 00:16:11,588
I have finally found what I've been looking for.

104
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:16,872
Oh my God. That is exactly hat my dad said when he met his fouth wife.

105
00:16:16,873 --> 00:16:19,311
I'm talking about me and J.D. McQueen.

106
00:16:20,611 --> 00:16:23,645
Now, that would be a tight fit.
Whitney, you may rule in this school,

107
00:16:23,646 --> 00:16:28,403
but J.D...
Being with J.D. will make me legendary, beyond this stupied little high school.

108
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:33,403
I guarantee it.
Hi, Bobett. Uh, you want to go yo prom?

109
00:16:35,275 --> 00:16:36,475
With me?
Ha ha ha ha!

110
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:43,261
Ok, I now that must've taken a lot of guts given that I'm one of prettiest girls in school

111
00:16:43,262 --> 00:16:50,109
and you're... wll, you.
ASo, uh, let me think about it, ok?

112
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,310
Ok, yeah.

113
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:55,529
Ok, so I just thought about ir, and, yeah, no. Ew.

114
00:16:59,836 --> 00:17:02,882
Why do you have to be so nice to everyone?
I'm not.

115
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:09,819
Judge not those who try and fail but those that fail to try.

116
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,794
Is that J.D. McQueen?
Oh, it's him.Does that kid go to our high school?
I can't believe he's here.

117
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:33,610
Talk to him!
He's so sexy.

118
00:17:42,488 --> 00:17:44,402
I'm gonna go talk to him.
Do it.

119
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,882
How do I look?
You are so hot. Oh, my God. I'm so glad you're my friend.

120
00:17:49,883 --> 00:17:52,375
Wish me luck.

121
00:18:10,315 --> 00:18:13,890
Hi  J.D.
My name is  Whitney Alison.

122
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:21,731
Know what double-A stands for?

123
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:28,364
Small battery?
Heh Heh. No. It means you can call me anytime, anywhere.

124
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,532
Oricand si oriunde.

125
00:19:00,174 --> 00:19:01,374
Hey, where'd my soda go?

126
00:19:09,835 --> 00:19:11,135
Did I eat already? What--

127
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:17,915
You should talk to him.

128
00:19:18,897 --> 00:19:21,355
He doesn't want to talk to me.

129
00:19:21,356 --> 00:19:23,701
You're right, and you'd better stay away from him because he's mine.

130
00:19:23,702 --> 00:19:27,432
Whitney, shouldn't you be in some teacher's office begging for a passing grade?

131
00:19:27,921 --> 00:19:33,056
Well, I wouldn't have to if it wasn't for Miss Brain Freak.

132
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,998
Dar ea mi-a stricat tot planul.
Ai vrut sa copiezi tot de la mine.

133
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:42,853
My 68 would be a "C" instead of a "D" but she ruined the curve.

134
00:19:44,568 --> 00:19:47,511
A grading curve ensures fairness. If your 68 had been the highest grade  it would've been an "A".
Well, if everyone would cooperate  and get a 68, then we'd all get "A"s.

135
00:19:48,207 --> 00:19:54,568
So, if everyone got a "D", everyone would get an "A"?

136
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:55,869
That' not a curve.

137
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:09,955
Brain freak, you woul not know a curve  if you had two rolls of toilet paper and a water bra.
Brace face.

138
00:20:10,813 --> 00:20:12,895
Excuse me, sir. Could you help me for a second?
They gave me a key to my locker but I can't find it. Being a pop star it's kind of hard to keep track of this kind os stuff.

139
00:20:12,896 --> 00:20:14,096
It's that one.

140
00:20:20,664 --> 00:20:24,186
This is your locker?
Heh. I'm a huge fan of me.

141
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:28,364
To whom much is given, much is expected.

142
00:20:54,334 --> 00:20:55,534
Want to quench your thist?
Be like J.D. McQueen. Drink Crystal Geyser.
He's so cute.

143
00:21:04,377 --> 00:21:08,151
I'm starting a lemonade stand.
Mmm. Tanks.

144
00:21:12,903 --> 00:21:17,079
That'll be $1,00.
Uh, let me give you a tip. Get the money first.

145
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:22,468
I'll get it. maybe it's someone who's thirsty.

146
00:21:29,642 --> 00:21:31,387
Hey, cutie. Got a date for the prom?

147
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,747
Oh, I hate when that happens.

148
00:21:43,534 --> 00:21:46,650
She fainted. Don't worry. Happens all the time.

149
00:21:48,787 --> 00:21:51,220
We should keep her feet elevated. That'd probably be best.

150
00:21:56,469 --> 00:21:59,631
Uh..uh... My-- my name is--is--is--

151
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,695
Take your time. It'll come to you.

152
00:22:04,887 --> 00:22:10,566
Oh, um, I found this at school and it had your address in it  so I thought I'd bring it back to you.

153
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,951
Where was it?
Um, it was over by the lockers.

154
00:22:24,295 --> 00:22:30,052
I like this room. It looks just like mine, but, uh... it doesn't have all the pictures of me on the wall.

155
00:22:31,965 --> 00:22:34,714
I like it. It's nice.
It's cool-- my kind of room.

156
00:22:41,836 --> 00:22:45,136
You ok?

157
00:22:45,137 --> 00:22:46,537
Hey, slleping princess, are you awake?

158
00:22:54,836 --> 00:23:00,665
Definitely my kind of room.
My-my dad and my psycho step-mom are due back soon.

159
00:23:02,902 --> 00:23:06,467
Is that her?
Oh, that's my real mom.

160
00:23:07,828 --> 00:23:10,426
Oh. Divorce?
Mine, too.

161
00:23:13,749 --> 00:23:17,850
Does Abby want to stay for dinner?
Hey, that is weird. I thought I paid that.

162
00:23:18,552 --> 00:23:19,851
We're gonna have pizza and...

163
00:23:27,011 --> 00:23:29,414
Holy cow.
Pizza and holy cow? Sounds yummy.

164
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,242
Mmm, that  smells good.

165
00:23:34,322 --> 00:23:35,522
Oh, hey, honey.

166
00:23:37,156 --> 00:23:40,922
Wow. I thought tonight was pizza night.

167
00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:47,487
Jane has a boy over for dinner -- J.D. McQueen.

168
00:23:48,822 --> 00:23:52,233
J.D McQeen?
Sounds sketchy.

169
00:23:53,638 --> 00:23:57,703
So, Shady, tell me a little about yourself.
Actually, it's, uh, J.D.

170
00:23:58,317 --> 00:24:02,261
Um, that's "J" period "D" period.
Oh, I see.

171
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:07,329
Well, not "I" period "C" period, but I see... period.

172
00:24:08,508 --> 00:24:11,431
What does J.D. stand for?
I don't like my real name.

173
00:24:13,186 --> 00:24:19,656
J.B., have you made your plans for college yet?
Sunshine here got a perfect score on her S.A.T.'s a lot of early acceptances--

174
00:24:19,657 --> 00:24:22,242
Stanford, Harvard, Yale, U.C Berkley.
Um, no, actually, I haven't seen it.

175
00:24:23,142 --> 00:24:29,501
I meant "U" period "C" period Berkeley.

176
00:24:30,212 --> 00:24:31,502
Jane here got a full scholarship.

177
00:24:35,353 --> 00:24:37,653
I'm not sure college is for me. I'm gonna be working, so--

178
00:24:38,688 --> 00:24:43,338
Ah, money's a little tight, huh, son?

179
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:46,339
Well, if you want to make your mark on this world you must get a college degree.

180
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:52,567
Heh. Dad's just saying that because he's been teaching at "S" period "C" cperiod "U" period for a very long period.

181
00:24:53,069 --> 00:24:55,765
Mari Havercorn got her period.

182
00:24:57,657 --> 00:24:59,657
So, can I call you?
Sure.

183
00:24:59,658 --> 00:25:05,514
I'm at my dad's on Thursdays and Fridays and alternating weekends and Wednesdays, and I'm at my mom's...

184
00:25:05,515 --> 00:25:07,198
Here, take this.

185
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:11,439
Now we're connected.

186
00:25:12,972 --> 00:25:14,172
Jane?

187
00:25:16,326 --> 00:25:17,890
Hell?Jane?

188
00:25:21,294 --> 00:25:23,362
Don't stay up too late tonight, all right?

189
00:25:23,931 --> 00:25:27,215
I know.
I know you know.

190
00:25:27,216 --> 00:25:30,620
I just... want to remind you.

191
00:25:32,103 --> 00:25:33,884
What are you working on?

192
00:25:34,723 --> 00:25:37,141
Can I help?
I don't need your help.

193
00:25:38,183 --> 00:25:39,801
You don't need my help. Ok.

194
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:43,711
You know, just once, I wish that you did.

195
00:25:46,788 --> 00:25:48,788
Good night.

196
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:16,379
Ah,Sunshine. You know  I've never interfered in your love life.

197
00:26:17,578 --> 00:26:20,700
I've never had a love life.
Yes, but you're going places.

198
00:26:20,701 --> 00:26:24,860
This kid, he's headed nowhere.
He's only the hottest pop star.

199
00:26:25,253 --> 00:26:29,146
Oh, I'm sure he's made tons of money playing in all the finest garages over the city.

200
00:26:30,156 --> 00:26:35,817
Between song royalties, product endorsements, and concert revenues, he makes over $10 milion a year.

201
00:26:36,246 --> 00:26:39,803
In the words of your generation, "Yeah, right."

202
00:26:43,777 --> 00:26:45,370
"I wish my boobs were bigger"?
No, no,no.

203
00:26:45,371 --> 00:26:46,934
Not that one. The other one.

204
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:57,189
"J.D McQueen adds Australia to summer world tour."

205
00:27:00,364 --> 00:27:01,664
"J" period "D" period?

206
00:27:08,076 --> 00:27:11,946
Did I ever tell you I hate walking to school?
It's better than the idiots on the bus.

207
00:27:15,955 --> 00:27:20,104
Don't enter a wet T-shirt contest. You'll never win.
Guys!

208
00:27:21,688 --> 00:27:22,888
Geeks!

209
00:27:26,864 --> 00:27:29,635
I really hate walking to school.

210
00:27:30,418 --> 00:27:31,636
Now what?

211
00:27:34,358 --> 00:27:38,093
Hey, you girls want a ride?
My name is--is--

212
00:27:38,749 --> 00:27:40,330
Take your time. It'll come to you.

213
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:42,031
Let's go.

214
00:27:49,414 --> 00:27:51,761
Jane. did I leave my shades at your house?
Cause I can't find them.

215
00:28:02,272 --> 00:28:04,920
Is it OK if I walk you to class? I don't want to piss your boyfriend off.

216
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:07,546
I don't have a boyfriend.
I was just checking.

217
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:11,605
You want to hook up Saturday?
I need to study.

218
00:28:12,193 --> 00:28:14,286
I'll tell you what. All the good cartoons are over by 11:00.

219
00:28:14,287 --> 00:28:18,504
At noon I'll pick you up, we'll get some lunch and after that, we'll crack a book together.

220
00:28:18,505 --> 00:28:21,272
What you say?
Whay me?

221
00:28:22,341 --> 00:28:24,689
Because I think you're special.
After you.

222
00:28:27,595 --> 00:28:31,226
It doesn't make any sense. Why me?
Jane, he thinks you're special.

223
00:28:31,674 --> 00:28:34,995
Hello? Go for it.
Yeah, but J.D. could have any girl he wants.

224
00:28:35,691 --> 00:28:36,896
Go for it.

225
00:28:43,746 --> 00:28:45,828
A four- leaf clover.
It's a sign, Jane.

226
00:28:45,829 --> 00:28:48,150
It means something wonderful is right in front of you.
Kick it! Over here! Got it!
Pass the ball!

227
00:29:02,912 --> 00:29:07,436
Your dad gave me three great girls so I say he was a perfect match.

228
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:11,071
Was it psycho Diane?

229
00:29:13,071 --> 00:29:15,935
It wasn't Diane. And wasn't your father.

230
00:29:17,198 --> 00:29:19,866
It was me. I thought you both knew that.

231
00:29:21,465 --> 00:29:22,865
Oh, Chrismas day?

232
00:29:24,274 --> 00:29:31,914
Yep. Your dad said, "Honey, the turkey seems a bit dry this year."

233
00:29:33,331 --> 00:29:36,920
Well, he had a point.
Thank you, Heh.

234
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,798
Anyway, I, uh... I went crazy.

235
00:29:44,677 --> 00:29:45,999
I remember.

236
00:29:47,905 --> 00:29:55,675
It's just..I had these fantasies about what my life was supposed tobe like.

237
00:29:56,813 --> 00:30:02,515
And when my destiny and my fantasy turned out to be two different things,

238
00:30:03,863 --> 00:30:08,134
it was easy to blame your father.
I'm afraid of making a mistake and messing up my destiny.

239
00:30:08,578 --> 00:30:11,351
The definition od destiny prevents that from happening.

240
00:30:11,771 --> 00:30:17,083
What about a twist of fate?
Like when you miss a bus, and it changes your whole life.

241
00:30:17,422 --> 00:30:21,205
Fate loves the fearless.
What's that supposed to mean?

242
00:30:21,206 --> 00:30:25,054
You have to be out there trying to catch the bus in the first place.

243
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,607
Do you have a special place?
My earlobes.

244
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:33,339
A girl nibbles on them, and it's, like, wow.

245
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,600
No! A special place, like Mount Olympus.

246
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:42,900
Mount what?
Greek mythology.

247
00:30:44,733 --> 00:30:51,265
Mount Olympus is where Zeus, the king of gods held court.
This is my special place. I come here to study, write, dream.

248
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,768
What do you dream about?
Stupid stuff.

249
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,269
I highly doubt that.

250
00:30:57,637 --> 00:31:00,349
But this-- this is stupid stuff.

251
00:31:00,805 --> 00:31:07,443
O mean, have you ever heard anybody say "If I could find the derivative of 2x-squared plus 5 I could make my house payments?"

252
00:31:07,444 --> 00:31:10,778
I love math.
Everyting is right or wrong.

253
00:31:11,584 --> 00:31:14,295
It's black or white.
It's precise, pure. It's perfect.

254
00:31:15,684 --> 00:31:19,441
All right. I'm fired up. Let's do some cool math stuff. You ready?

255
00:31:20,256 --> 00:31:23,758
Now, so think of a fuction as a box.

256
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,379
You plug in different values for "X" and you get different values for "Y".

257
00:31:27,725 --> 00:31:31,080
Oh. So, then you graph the "X" and then "Y" axis.

258
00:31:31,081 --> 00:31:36,637
Exactly.
So, on problem number twelve as "X" increases,"Y"...

259
00:31:36,638 --> 00:31:38,462
Decreases.
Good. Ha ha.

260
00:31:40,695 --> 00:31:43,787
All right, um, let's do problem number four.
Ok, let's try four.

261
00:32:08,012 --> 00:32:10,012
I got it!
Hold on one seceond.

262
00:32:12,225 --> 00:32:14,993
All right, let me see this.
They're a perfect match.

263
00:32:32,364 --> 00:32:36,228
Oh, this is a beautiful car.
And it's your favorite color.

264
00:32:37,464 --> 00:32:38,764
How'd you know that?

265
00:32:39,378 --> 00:32:40,765
I know a lot about you.

266
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:46,758
Wanna drive it?
Oh, I'm not a very good driver.

267
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:52,533
I hit a deer last Deember, and I haven't driven since.
That's not your fault.

268
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:56,539
They jump in front of cars all the time.
Not when they're attached to Santa Claus and sevem plastic reindeer.

269
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,514
You had an accident. Practice makes perfect.
I've never driven a Porsche before.

270
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:03,249
It's time to learn.

271
00:33:10,265 --> 00:33:12,559
OK.

272
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,925
I don't know what I'm doing. I've never done this before.
Driving's like a math equation. There's a formula to it.

273
00:33:16,764 --> 00:33:18,746
All right, step on the brake. Start it up.

274
00:33:22,326 --> 00:33:23,570
Put it in drive. Let's go.

275
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,293
Oh, no. I broke your car.
No, you haven't. Press the brake.

276
00:33:29,294 --> 00:33:31,256
I'll put it in gear for you.

277
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:35,772
Hit it.

278
00:33:39,300 --> 00:34:37,425
Wow, this is so much better than math.

279
00:35:31,628 --> 00:35:34,577
Cool. It's my first text message.

280
00:35:35,169 --> 00:35:39,957
"What's your favorite color?"
Red. Heh.

281
00:35:54,622 --> 00:35:55,765
"Good night,Jane."

282
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:03,493
"Sleep...tight... J.D."

283
00:36:07,617 --> 00:36:12,519
Why did I write "Sleep tight?"
That's just stupid. what does that mean?

284
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:18,244
He must-- he must think I'm an idiot.
Who knew text messaging would be so stressful?

285
00:36:26,278 --> 00:36:27,478
Hey, Abby. What?
Heh.

286
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,446
"Jane, I tought this would look good on you. J.D."

287
00:36:41,524 --> 00:36:47,137
He bought me a car?
He's J.D. McQueen. To him, buying a car is like buying a pair of sneakers.

288
00:36:48,505 --> 00:36:51,465
He bought me a car?
Not  just any car. a Porsche.
Come on!

289
00:36:56,441 --> 00:36:59,543
Hey, Jane. Nice car.

290
00:36:59,544 --> 00:37:02,544
Hi, Jane.
Hey, Jane. Nice car.

291
00:37:02,545 --> 00:37:05,067
Did I ever tell you-- I love driving to school.

292
00:37:26,973 --> 00:37:29,986
J.D, is this for real?
Unless you want a different color.

293
00:37:29,987 --> 00:37:33,892
I don't understand. Why?
You needed a car. I wanted to help you out.

294
00:37:33,892 --> 00:37:50,055
Maybe someday you could help me out, too.

295
00:37:33,893 --> 00:37:38,031
I gotta go to work.
All right. Me too. I'll see you later. Bye.

296
00:37:45,629 --> 00:37:49,156
Hey, come on.

297
00:37:52,784 --> 00:37:57,291
Let's do this.

298
00:38:00,186 --> 00:38:01,386
OK.

299
00:38:04,373 --> 00:38:06,439
Hello. What's your name?

300
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,240
Anna.

301
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:21,497
Hey.

302
00:38:24,082 --> 00:38:27,874
I called your insurance agent and told him about my new car.
Um, dad, you remember you said if I got a car you'd pay for my insurance?

303
00:38:39,805 --> 00:38:41,804
Oh, good. You remember.

304
00:38:58,497 --> 00:39:00,497
Ok, come right here.

305
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:41,038
Whoo!!

306
00:39:49,061 --> 00:39:50,261
Are you ok?

307
00:39:55,262 --> 00:39:56,462
Hi,Jane.

308
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,220
What's up,Jane?

309
00:40:01,925 --> 00:40:03,125
What's going on, Jane?

310
00:40:11,413 --> 00:40:13,980
Do you remember me?
Hey, Jane.

311
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:30,700
She still has braces.She's still a geek.
Say, was that your high school helper I saw today at the autograph thing?

312
00:40:31,607 --> 00:40:35,178
Heh heh. Yeah. Her name is Jane Brighton.
She showed me her special place.

313
00:40:35,437 --> 00:40:38,842
Behind the earlobes?
She call it her Mount Olympus.

314
00:40:39,468 --> 00:40:42,060
I've never heard it called that before.
It's a park bench down by the beach.

315
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,242
We go there. We just hang out.

316
00:40:47,001 --> 00:40:50,645
We talk. We do math.
Great, see?

317
00:40:51,202 --> 00:40:53,615
I told you this high school thing was gonna be a breeze.

318
00:40:54,146 --> 00:40:59,338
Not exactly, Grant.
I have a math test tomorrow. Tere's just something I hate about taking tests.
Yeah, the questions.

319
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:02,287
What happened? Are you sick?

320
00:42:02,288 --> 00:42:05,606
I've been puking all morning. Hey, how was the test? Was it hard?

321
00:42:06,138 --> 00:42:09,034
Um, nah, we just had to graph a non-linear function-- "S" times cosine "Y".

322
00:42:09,035 --> 00:42:13,407
Did you use the mean value theorem to solve that one?

323
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:17,285
Exactly.
Oh,uh, I almost forgot.

324
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:22,036
Mr. Thomas has a policy about no make-up exams so the final will be 100% of your grade.

325
00:42:23,342 --> 00:42:25,463
J.D?
I'm starting to feel sick again.

326
00:42:39,227 --> 00:42:45,133
And you've been listening to the very hot J.D. McQueen.
He's actually gonna be in the studio joining us shortly, and I'm tell--

327
00:42:45,747 --> 00:42:49,148
Oh, hey, there he is.
What's going on?

328
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:52,333
Speak of the good-looking devil, and in he walks.
Look at you. Give me some of this.
What's going on?

329
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:56,258
Have a little of this. Mwah.Mwah.
Don't be jealous, girls.

330
00:42:56,259 --> 00:42:59,591
You were just voted by Teen People as one of the fifty most beautiful people in the world.

331
00:42:59,592 --> 00:43:01,592
I know. It was an honor, you know?
Were you excited?

332
00:43:02,206 --> 00:43:05,784
It was a little weird. Ha ha. You Know?
Yeah. Everybody has been calling all day.

333
00:43:05,785 --> 00:43:08,188
All the girls want to know about you and your personal life.

334
00:43:08,649 --> 00:43:11,877
And I heard a few rumors lately that you might have a girlfriend. Is that true?

335
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:16,090
Uh, it's been really good.
I have a really good relationship  with a girl-a friend and, you know, we're having a good time and she's helping me out a lot, so...

336
00:43:16,091 --> 00:43:20,479
Oh, I don't want to drop a bomb here...

337
00:43:21,061 --> 00:43:26,067
but I think that certain someone  could be a certain London Sheridan.

338
00:43:27,282 --> 00:43:31,334
Ring any bells?

339
00:43:32,126 --> 00:43:34,335
My relationship with London is special.

340
00:43:34,336 --> 00:43:35,430
Really special?Come on, our listeners want to know. How special is it?
They want to know that they have a chance.

341
00:43:35,431 --> 00:43:39,400
We get along. We do get along.
Aha. So, you're friends, but, like, kissing friends.

342
00:43:40,092 --> 00:43:45,875
London and I have a special relationship.
Ah. Well, you know what, listeners? We're gonna find out all about that relationship.

343
00:43:45,876 --> 00:43:48,212
We'ew gonna take a break, and then we're gonna dump...

344
00:43:48,939 --> 00:43:50,880
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Why did you ditch me yesterday?

345
00:43:54,116 --> 00:43:56,337
Let me call you right back, all right?
Who was that, London?

346
00:43:57,263 --> 00:44:01,797
No. She has a high squeaky voice.
What makes your relationship with her so special?

347
00:44:02,843 --> 00:44:08,357
I don't know. I mean, we come from the same kind of world ans he's not same loser user.

348
00:44:09,353 --> 00:44:11,874
Well, I'm not a loser, and I'm not a user.

349
00:44:13,421 --> 00:44:16,101
Why don't you go back to your famous world where everyone's so special?

350
00:44:18,441 --> 00:44:20,362
I didn't mean it that way!

351
00:44:25,298 --> 00:44:26,498
J.D! J.D.!

352
00:44:29,271 --> 00:44:30,471
J.D, we love you!

353
00:44:36,402 --> 00:44:37,602
J.D!I love you!

354
00:44:43,401 --> 00:44:44,601
J.D, wait!

355
00:44:49,027 --> 00:44:51,027
I'm just a normal guy.

356
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:54,853
Well, almost, but not quite.
Now, listen, I got the press here.

357
00:44:54,854 --> 00:44:57,287
I want lots of smiles, lots of smiles.
Come on, come on, come on. Let's go. Lot's of smiles. Positive.

358
00:44:58,386 --> 00:45:00,515
J.D, what's it like to be in public school again?

359
00:45:01,404 --> 00:45:05,004
Well, I've  actually never been to public school before but I'm excited to be here.

360
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:08,734
You know, I want to make some new friends and do really good in my school work and maybe even find a date for the prom.

361
00:45:09,918 --> 00:45:11,391
You'll have no trouble doing that.

362
00:45:11,392 --> 00:45:14,278
But howis this affcting your songwriting?

363
00:45:15,419 --> 00:45:18,247
It's kind os hard to deal with right now, you know? Because, you know, I'm back in school, and... but it will be dealt with soon.

364
00:45:18,869 --> 00:45:22,172
So, is mom happy now that you're back in school?

365
00:45:22,657 --> 00:45:25,244
She is now.
Thanks very much, fellas. Thank you, guys.
Tanks, J.D.

366
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:29,147
Are you interested?
Oh, I am more than interested.

367
00:45:29,148 --> 00:45:32,239
I'm not talking some tabloid puff story about my date with J.D. McQueen.

368
00:45:32,818 --> 00:45:36,225
I'm talking about the stuff that goes on after and I'll provite photos.

369
00:45:36,226 --> 00:45:40,854
Of what?
Of me.

370
00:45:41,745 --> 00:45:47,151
I want the article to feature photos of me. And I want to be on the cover.
Well, if you want a cover story, you have to uncover a story.

371
00:45:48,591 --> 00:45:49,791
Heh. Done.

372
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,096
This isn't a home. It's a hotel.

373
00:46:03,664 --> 00:46:04,864
"Do not disturb"

374
00:46:19,537 --> 00:46:20,837
Scumbag.

375
00:46:22,532 --> 00:46:24,532
I think that's one word.

376
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:38,752
So.. how long you been singing?

377
00:46:39,527 --> 00:46:40,727
About three weeks.

378
00:46:53,536 --> 00:46:58,140
Diamonds are forever.
Keep in touch.

379
00:47:09,211 --> 00:47:12,115
So.. how's it going?

380
00:47:13,395 --> 00:47:14,595
A little writer's block.

381
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:21,451
This high school thing isn't gonna be a problem, is it?

382
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:26,326
I sure hope not.
Great, cause it just wouldn't be the same

383
00:47:27,031 --> 00:47:30,139
managing someone else.
Someone else?

384
00:47:30,985 --> 00:47:35,208
Grant, it'll just be the summer tour I'll miss.
Not according to your record label.

385
00:47:36,441 --> 00:47:39,182
If you're not out on tour this summer you're out--

386
00:47:40,178 --> 00:47:41,383
period.

387
00:47:41,384 --> 00:47:42,784
What do you mean, period?

388
00:47:44,827 --> 00:47:48,767
J.D, the music industry is a factory.

389
00:47:48,768 --> 00:47:52,395
You and every other artist are on their conveyor belt.

390
00:47:52,842 --> 00:47:56,747
It's a business, and avery business is about making money.

391
00:47:57,497 --> 00:48:00,388
As far as they're concerned, it's record, tour, and sell...

392
00:48:02,643 --> 00:48:04,778
or else you're finished.

393
00:48:08,248 --> 00:48:12,573
Are you serious?
I promised I would never lie to you.

394
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,260
Tanks.

395
00:48:18,393 --> 00:48:19,593
Yeah.

396
00:48:25,034 --> 00:48:30,380
Asa ca, gandeste-te la asta.

397
00:48:35,894 --> 00:48:37,194
So, just...just think about, ok?
See you later, partner.

398
00:48:46,145 --> 00:48:48,608
You gave him back the car?
Are you serious?

399
00:48:49,139 --> 00:48:52,592
He's not my perfect match.
He's one of Teen People's fifty hottest.

400
00:48:53,289 --> 00:48:56,825
His news album is climbing the charts.
What's wrong with you?

401
00:48:58,832 --> 00:49:00,032
Come here.

402
00:49:01,496 --> 00:49:05,502
Tell the story again.
Oh, we've told you a hundred times.

403
00:49:05,503 --> 00:49:07,098
No,no. come on, one more time for Abby.

404
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:10,712
Ok. Well, it was  New York City

405
00:49:12,626 --> 00:49:17,087
and was May

406
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:21,035
Just thinking of that day makes me thirsty.

407
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:28,588
My friend Sally called me and her new beau had this friend I should come over and meet.

408
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:33,597
I dind't rven want to go out that day but I made a promise to my pal Ray.

409
00:49:34,377 --> 00:49:37,559
Your friend was totally psychic. She knews you two were destined to be together.

410
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:43,915
Friend? No. On our way to the subway Henrietta popped into the five and dime to get a soda.

411
00:49:43,916 --> 00:49:49,340
And there was this handsome man behind the counter.
I promised Ray I would cover his shift at the soda fountain.

412
00:49:49,341 --> 00:49:55,216
That soda was the best drink I ever had.
Aw.

413
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:00,396
Tanks. See?

414
00:50:03,112 --> 00:50:05,552
Speaking of which, would you like to get a soda?

415
00:50:05,829 --> 00:50:07,997
I'd love to.
Want to share one?

416
00:50:08,348 --> 00:50:10,329
No, I want one of my own.

417
00:50:19,227 --> 00:50:22,476
See? That's how it happens.
A perfect match.

418
00:50:23,313 --> 00:50:27,870
No heartbreak, no divorse, no lonely nights at home watching sappy romance movies.

419
00:50:28,777 --> 00:50:32,434
You came uo with this whole perfect match stuff because you're afraid of failing at relationships.

420
00:50:32,435 --> 00:50:34,802
You're boyfriend-aphobic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

421
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:54,534
Keep the change.
I've never even seen a $ 100-bill before.

422
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:04,526
Gee, you can free refills for life.
Oh, that's great. Tanks.

423
00:51:06,517 --> 00:51:11,902
Hey, Jane. You know, most people just want to be friends with me  cause I'm famous.

424
00:51:12,651 --> 00:51:16,319
Lucky you.
Not really.

425
00:51:17,253 --> 00:51:19,116
I'm a pop star, which means that at any time, pop, it's all over.

426
00:51:20,157 --> 00:51:23,583
Then someone else is popular  and anyone who likes J.D. McQueen is a total geek.

427
00:51:24,128 --> 00:51:29,351
I'm already a geek.

428
00:51:30,541 --> 00:51:33,423
The truth is, you're from a completely different world.
Imean, everybody recognizes you.

429
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:37,657
Everybody likes you.
Everyone knows you.

430
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:41,424
But I don't know enyone. I mean, think about it.
The only person I really know is you.

431
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:55,538
So, when did your parents get divorced?
Six years ago, Christmas day.

432
00:51:55,539 --> 00:52:00,866
Heh. So, they wanted to ruin every Christmas for the rest your life?

433
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:05,463
I don't think they planned it.
Mom got mad.

434
00:52:05,464 --> 00:52:07,255
Dad got a turkey on his lap and everything else on his head.

435
00:52:08,363 --> 00:52:11,377
You know, two years ago, my parents asked me what I wanted for my birthday.

436
00:52:13,327 --> 00:52:16,681
And I just told them I wanted them to stop fighting, and my dad moved out later that night.

437
00:52:18,262 --> 00:52:19,462
I did not need this today.

438
00:52:24,816 --> 00:52:27,587
Dad, what's the matter?

439
00:52:28,336 --> 00:52:32,216
Oh, God.
Diane's not home yet I got a lecture in ten minutes, and the car won't start.

440
00:52:32,796 --> 00:52:34,217
Take Jane's car.

441
00:52:36,631 --> 00:52:37,831
You sure?
Yeah, sure.

442
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,100
Oh, thanks.

443
00:52:42,455 --> 00:52:44,789
Carry on.
Bye, Dad.

444
00:53:02,003 --> 00:53:06,031
So, what are you doing Saturday night?
Oh, PBS is running this series on the American presidents.

445
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:11,267
Dang. I was kind of hoping I could take you out.
I'll tape it.

446
00:53:20,502 --> 00:53:21,702
OK.
Men can't resist a flat tummy. Isometric hold for ten seconds.

447
00:53:21,703 --> 00:53:25,114
1,2...3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.
Now lay flat on your back.

448
00:53:29,178 --> 00:53:30,378
You got that part down.

449
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:36,350
Did you hear Mr. Thomas gave kevin an "F"?

450
00:53:37,137 --> 00:53:39,351
I heard. That totally sucks he got caught cheating.

451
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:43,505
No, it sucls that he cheated, not that he got caught.
Ask anyone who cheats. Is it the cheating

452
00:53:44,215 --> 00:53:45,506
or getting caught that sucks?

453
00:53:59,367 --> 00:54:00,567
Cheaters suck.
And ten more seconds.

454
00:54:03,021 --> 00:54:04,986
I hate my smile.
Oh, no, a zit!

455
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:27,362
I do it the old-fashioned way.

456
00:54:29,392 --> 00:54:30,592
Ow!
Sorry. Ha ha ha.
God.

457
00:54:32,932 --> 00:54:37,653
Jane, you need to be careful.
At some point, this fairy tale is gonna end.

458
00:54:38,313 --> 00:54:44,452
It' not like you're gonna marry him and tou're not prepared for heartbreak.

459
00:54:45,758 --> 00:54:48,346
What are you talking about?
J.D. and I are just friends and that's all we're gonna be-- just friends.

460
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,251
Honey, I'm home.
How was your show, dear?

461
00:54:53,841 --> 00:54:58,811
Exhausting.
We did three encores  and Grant needs all the new songs by Monday so I'll be busy this weekened.

462
00:54:58,812 --> 00:55:04,533
Well, this will make you feel better. I made your favorite -- cream pie.
You are just perfect.

463
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:08,150
I hope there's enough for everyone.
I brought some freinds over.

464
00:55:08,151 --> 00:55:09,351
Come on in, girls.

465
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:23,540
You're Jane, right?
I'm Grant Powers, J.D.'s manager and trust me, taking care of things is what I do best.

466
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:27,571
J.D. sent you?

467
00:55:27,572 --> 00:55:32,460
It's time for you to get off work and for us to go do a little shopping.

468
00:55:49,586 --> 00:55:52,878
This must be wrong.
Jane, come here.

469
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,590
How about that?
No way. I'd be totally afraid to wear that.

470
00:56:00,208 --> 00:56:05,836
It looks really expensive.
Jane, it's time to be fearless.

471
00:56:06,926 --> 00:56:14,988
I don't think J.D. would like that.
Heh. Trust me.

472
00:56:17,755 --> 00:56:20,536
And as far as the price goes... I told you I'm here t otake care of things, right?

473
00:56:21,225 --> 00:56:24,204
You are gonna blow J.D.'s mind when he sees you in this dress.
I feel like Im in a fairy tale.

474
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:27,193
Yeah? How about lunch?
Oh, no. I'm late for an appointment. I got to go.

475
00:56:27,194 --> 00:56:29,447
Wait, Jane, your stuff.

476
00:56:30,029 --> 00:56:31,759
Oh. I'm sorry. I got to go. I'm really late.

477
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:35,299
Jane, have a great time.

478
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:42,331
Poor kid.

479
00:57:02,328 --> 00:57:03,528
Thanks.

480
00:57:19,514 --> 00:57:23,314
Oh, this is so exciting.
Samantha, qill you get your sister, please?
Jane!

481
00:57:23,515 --> 00:57:24,715
Thank you, Sam. Thank you.

482
00:57:26,588 --> 00:57:28,970
Hi J.D.
Hi.
Jane's almost ready. Come on in.

483
00:57:29,868 --> 00:57:32,810
Hey, will you take Jane to her dad's tonight after your date?
Yeah, no problem.

484
00:57:32,811 --> 00:57:34,011
Thank you.

485
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:54,938
You look, uh, uh..

486
00:57:55,524 --> 00:57:56,823
Take your time. It'll come to you!

487
00:57:59,847 --> 00:58:02,847
Ok, you kids be safe.
Behave.

488
00:58:03,727 --> 00:58:05,048
Bye, Jane.
See you guys later. Bye.

489
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:29,928
I've never been in a limo before.

490
00:58:30,777 --> 00:58:33,887
This is so cool.
It's no big deal. You get used to it after a while.

491
00:58:36,571 --> 00:58:40,156
So, where are we going?
We are going to the music awards.

492
00:58:40,739 --> 00:58:42,714
The what?
The music awards. It's cool.

493
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:46,447
This isn't really happening.

494
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:30,136
Guys, come on, come on.
J.D., J.D., can I have you for a minute? Hey, man, love the new album.

495
00:59:30,137 --> 00:59:34,968
Thank you very much. I appreciate that.
I notice you briught a girl here to the awards. What's the relationship?

496
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:39,789
Well, she's a good friend.
Any comment on your relatinship with London?

497
00:59:40,478 --> 00:59:43,396
Another good friend.Hey, man, variety-- it'd the spice of life.

498
00:59:43,397 --> 00:59:45,397
Well, it's good to be J.D. McQueen.

499
01:00:00,864 --> 01:00:02,064
Jane?

500
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:31,909
So, did you have a good time tonight?
Are you kidding me? It was incredible.

501
01:00:32,908 --> 01:00:36,520
Hey, I'm sorry I had to keep leaving you to do those interviews.

502
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:41,959
It's just all part of the business.
Well, I'm sorry that you didn't win.

503
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:43,960
Next year, it'll be you.Yeah. Maybe, maybe not.

504
01:00:50,543 --> 01:00:52,809
Oh, my toe.
Dad, you're an idiot.

505
01:00:54,744 --> 01:00:59,312
I never noticed, but you have a great smile.

506
01:00:59,313 --> 01:01:02,019
Imi place e foart dragut.
No, I hate it.

507
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:10,820
No, I like it. It's cute.
You have this thing.
In my teeth?

508
01:01:10,821 --> 01:01:12,256
No. This thing that breaks me down.

509
01:01:12,926 --> 01:01:21,262
Jane, I'm two different people.

510
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:26,575
J.D. is this amazing, super cool, supert confident kid.
He's the guy all the girls want.

511
01:01:27,986 --> 01:01:32,221
But when I'm with you  I'm just plain old Joe McQueen.
I like Joe.

512
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:37,609
Well, I don't. There's nothing special about Joe right down to the name.
What's wrong with the name Joe?
Average Joe, Joe Schmoe, Joe Blow.

513
01:01:38,637 --> 01:01:44,348
Ok, Ok, ook, You don't like my smile.
That's my point. Joe loves your smile.

514
01:01:46,233 --> 01:01:48,233
I love your smile. Really, I do.

515
01:02:02,988 --> 01:02:08,626
Jane, do me a favor. Please don't tell anybody about this.
I want to keep it our secret.

516
01:02:23,084 --> 01:02:26,084
I can't believe it!
You're in Teen People!

517
01:02:27,653 --> 01:02:30,653
Ha ha ha! Let's read it. Whoo!

518
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:34,180
"Variety is the spice of life?"

519
01:02:36,909 --> 01:02:42,333
So, what's going on with you and the super freak?
She's telling everyone you guys are soul mates.

520
01:02:43,374 --> 01:02:45,700
I think I heard something about a wedding as soon as you turn eighteen.

521
01:02:46,258 --> 01:02:48,635
What?
You're mad. I can tell.

522
01:02:48,636 --> 01:02:51,106
I'm not mad.
Yes, you are.
No, I'm not.

523
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:55,156
J.D, dif you gave me a chance I would treat you like a king.

524
01:02:56,656 --> 01:03:02,820
Come on, I already told everybody you're taking me to the prom.
No, thanks.

525
01:03:03,539 --> 01:03:06,821
I put my entire high school reputation on the line.
I'm sorry, Whitney.

526
01:03:07,344 --> 01:03:13,153
Fine. You leave me no choice. If you don't ask me out I'll tell everyone you're a lip syncer.

527
01:03:13,675 --> 01:03:17,453
You know that's not true.
Tell it t othe tabloids bacause that's gonna be quite a story.

528
01:03:19,237 --> 01:03:21,237
Look, all I'm asking for is one night  with the J.D McQueen.

529
01:03:30,405 --> 01:03:38,001
In my twenty-three years as a janitor  I've seen spray paint  krazy glue, graffiti, gum.

530
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:45,123
I've never serrn anything like this.

531
01:03:45,124 --> 01:03:49,209
Now, here's an item that no J.D. fan should be without.

532
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:54,030
That's right, J.D.'s locker.
Does anyone want it? $ 100.
I take 100.
$100.

533
01:03:54,550 --> 01:03:56,031
J.D. is diciding who he's gonna ask to prom at this very moment.
And who's he gonna pick? Me.

534
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:05,272
What about Jane Brighton?
When school's finished...she is finished

535
01:04:05,885 --> 01:04:10,830
You're right. She won't be here next year like you.

536
01:04:18,282 --> 01:04:20,282
Whitney, will go to prom with me?

537
01:04:21,938 --> 01:04:26,766
Hi. Uh, Justin. I realize you're, like, the hottest girl in school.

538
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:35,836
I probably shouldn't even try asking you...

539
01:04:36,626 --> 01:04:41,426
but a wise man once told me that the... um... the true losers in life

540
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:44,331
are not who, uh, try ahn fail but those who fail to try.

541
01:04:46,742 --> 01:04:50,070
So, uh, you--you want t ogo to the prom with me, Whitney?

542
01:04:52,543 --> 01:04:54,378
Yes.
You will?

543
01:04:56,411 --> 01:05:00,106
If you do three things.
OK.
Lose thirty pounds, grow six inches, then win the lottery ahd give all the money.

544
01:05:01,013 --> 01:05:04,775
What was that first thing?

545
01:05:05,858 --> 01:05:07,718
Get lost.

546
01:05:07,719 --> 01:05:09,719
Seriously.
Let's go.

547
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:21,766
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so I had it twice.

548
01:05:24,037 --> 01:05:25,246
I trew up.
Are you all right?

549
01:05:25,981 --> 01:05:29,686
It's the grades that aren't all right.
A-B-C-D...F.

550
01:05:31,742 --> 01:05:34,454
Why'd they skip "E"?
Because failure starts with "F".

551
01:05:35,003 --> 01:05:42,762
Yeah, but "C" is for average, which starts with an "A".
And "A" is for excellent, which starts with an "E". And "D" is for below average, which atarts with a "B".

552
01:05:43,686 --> 01:05:47,101
And "B" is for above average, which starts with an "A".

553
01:05:47,589 --> 01:05:51,000
Think about it. "F" is the only one that makes sense.
You're burning up.

554
01:05:52,539 --> 01:06:02,347
My point is, grades are just so stupid. They don't make sence.
Jane, if I don't get an answer to a question, is it OK--

555
01:06:03,768 --> 01:06:07,189
It's ok. Just skip it and then go back to it. You'll do fine.

556
01:06:11,098 --> 01:06:12,298
You right, you right.

557
01:06:15,006 --> 01:06:16,206
I can do this.

558
01:06:48,625 --> 01:06:50,625
Turn your tests over and begin.

559
01:09:01,748 --> 01:09:04,744
What was that?
Wat?

560
01:09:04,745 --> 01:09:07,290
I saw you. You cheated off me.
Jane! Shh! Keep quiet!

561
01:09:07,733 --> 01:09:10,862
This was your plan all along.
Everything was a lie.

562
01:09:11,324 --> 01:09:16,422
I shouldn't seen this a mile away.
"Here's the car. How about a date? Even a kiss?" All I have to do is let you copy off of me and not say anything.

563
01:09:17,066 --> 01:09:23,201
What if you had gotten caught?
Mr. Thomas would've thought that I was helping you. I would've gotten suspended. I would've lost my scholarships.

564
01:09:25,177 --> 01:09:28,708
But you don't care, do you?
Listen, I get nervous when I take tests.

565
01:09:25,583 --> 01:09:33,064
Next thing, you're gonna tell me that you have stage fright.
No, it only happens when I take tests.

566
01:09:33,065 --> 01:09:35,695
My whole body freezes up.

567
01:09:35,696 --> 01:09:41,560
I'm so stupied.
You're not stupied. I cheated because I have to pass my classes--

568
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:44,855
I don't care why. You cheated.
Who cheated?

569
01:09:52,994 --> 01:09:58,600
He cheated on me with another girl.
But now I know of person he is...

570
01:09:59,776 --> 01:10:01,776
I don't ever want to see him again.

571
01:10:15,843 --> 01:10:20,742
You know what makes a diamond?
Is this one of those stories where I'm a lump pf coal?

572
01:10:21,515 --> 01:10:28,270
Tha flaws, Jane. It's the flaws that make life precious.
I understand. You're saying J.D. was a mistake.

573
01:10:28,271 --> 01:10:36,176
No. No. I'm saying don't be afraid of mistakes.

574
01:10:36,177 --> 01:10:42,804
Listen, if it weren't for the bad times the good times wouldn't seem so good.
Now, as for me, I'm gonna go to the salon.

575
01:10:44,867 --> 01:10:46,067
It's a good idea.
OK.

576
01:11:27,623 --> 01:11:32,980
And now for tody's showcase special. That's right.
For $ 100, I've got J.D.'s gym--
Hey! You little--
Run, everybody.

577
01:11:35,298 --> 01:11:40,764
What do you think you're doing?
Where do you think you're going?

578
01:11:45,864 --> 01:11:51,380
Don't you think it's messed up tp sell my shorts for $ 100?
Yeah, I do. I could get 200, easy.

579
01:11:52,321 --> 01:11:57,120
I hate this stupid school.
If you can't change the wind, adjust your sail

580
01:11:58,220 --> 01:12:00,220
What's that supposed to mean?
You can't change the influences of those around you but you can change the way you respond.

581
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:06,150
Heh. So, you're saying I should take control.

582
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:26,605
Mr. Thomas?
There's something I have to tell you.

583
01:14:38,029 --> 01:14:41,450
J.D told Mr. Thomas he cheated off you and Mr. Thomas flunked him.

584
01:14:41,451 --> 01:14:43,833
I don't believe it.
Why would he do that?

585
01:14:44,315 --> 01:14:47,707
Why do you care? You once said "It's the cheating not the getting caught that sucks."
Remember?

586
01:14:48,416 --> 01:14:52,633
Do you really think there's such a thing as fear of tests?
Yeah, right. Testophobia?

587
01:15:11,996 --> 01:15:15,598
Testophobia is for real.
Just because is on internet doesn't mean it's real.

588
01:15:20,631 --> 01:15:23,581
Hey, Sam. Is Jane home?
She's not here.

589
01:15:24,571 --> 01:15:26,590
I really messed up, huh?
I have to go to school.

590
01:15:27,258 --> 01:15:29,591
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

591
01:15:33,136 --> 01:15:35,136
I think I love her, Sam.

592
01:15:35,137 --> 01:15:38,724
For show and tell, I was gonna bring some owl puke I found...

593
01:15:40,209 --> 01:15:43,917
but I think this is one better.

594
01:15:44,839 --> 01:15:49,866
Please welcome J.D McQueen.
singer, dancer, songwriter and my friend.

595
01:15:50,957 --> 01:15:52,957
Hi, J.D.!
Hi, J.D.!

596
01:15:55,097 --> 01:15:58,212
What's it like when every girl wants to kiss you?

597
01:15:59,316 --> 01:16:03,058
That's not true. Is it?
What's it like being J.D McQueen?

598
01:16:04,076 --> 01:16:06,076
Well, being an atertainer is a lot like any job.

599
01:16:08,447 --> 01:16:11,133
There's deadlines, bosses, and a lot of pressure.

600
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:20,070
You gotta remember, it is a business.
But being J.D. McQueen is a lot easier than being Joe McQueen.

601
01:16:20,830 --> 01:16:27,384
You see, J.D.-- he's just an act. But Joe-- he's the guy who has to pick up all the pieces when the screaming stops.

602
01:16:29,702 --> 01:16:31,718
Who's Joe?
I am.

603
01:16:34,891 --> 01:16:37,838
A.J., do you have a question?
J.D., can I have your autograph?

604
01:16:38,513 --> 01:16:43,476
Autographs are $ 3,00, a picture with J.D. is 10 and kisses are 20.

605
01:16:44,182 --> 01:16:47,352
Kisses?
This is way better than my lemonade stand.

606
01:16:48,131 --> 01:16:58,773
Simply put, it's the fear of tanking tests.
It's what therapists call a social phobia or anxiety disorder.

607
01:16:58,774 --> 01:17:04,049
So, someone can perform in front of thousands of people ans still have fear of tests?

608
01:17:04,604 --> 01:17:07,848
Yes, is happens. A lot of people get performance anxiety. It just takes on different forms.
Dr. Brighton, your 4:00 appointment is here.

609
01:17:09,226 --> 01:17:14,826
Have him wait. This is important.

610
01:17:14,827 --> 01:17:19,514
So, some entertainers get chronic panic attacks so severe that the become physically ill with headaches, fever, even vomiting.

611
01:17:19,515 --> 01:17:23,158
That sounds like J.D. right before the test.

612
01:17:24,087 --> 01:17:28,410
Thanks, Diane. I really appreciate it.
You're welcome. I'm glad I could help.

613
01:17:35,241 --> 01:17:37,241
Yeah, that's great, Stevie. We'll, uh, we'll get back to you, ok?
Mr. Powers, the next audition's here. I'm sending him in.

614
01:17:49,299 --> 01:17:53,079
Mr Thomas?
I know why J.D. cheated.

615
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:57,724
No sob stories, Miss Brighton.
He knows the material. He just freezes up on the tests.

616
01:17:58,194 --> 01:18:03,862
This matter has nothing to do with you.
This matter has everything to do with me.

617
01:18:03,863 --> 01:18:07,761
I know exactly what it's like to stress out about a test.
I mean, to be afraid that you're gonna do your best and that you're gonna get the right answer?

618
01:18:08,234 --> 01:18:11,319
But, Jane, those feelings are perfectly normal.
Perfectly normal. Heh. Thanks.

619
01:18:12,661 --> 01:18:20,743
Because God knows if I wanted t obe normal I'd to be perfectly normal.
I'm obsessed with perfection with finding the perfect boyfriend, with picking the perfect school.

620
01:18:21,425 --> 01:18:27,590
Mr. Thomas, I got a perfect 1600 on my S.A.T.'s.
People don't call me perfectly normal. Thay call me a freak.

621
01:18:29,126 --> 01:18:33,217
J.D is the opposite side of that coin.
I fire up for tests, he freezes.

622
01:18:35,899 --> 01:18:39,923
Give J.D. a second chance.
You know my rule.

623
01:18:41,021 --> 01:18:44,850
You taught. He learned.
I can prove that.

624
01:18:45,227 --> 01:18:49,386
J.D just needs to be in his special place.

625
01:18:52,139 --> 01:18:57,785
Grades have to be in by final bell today.
Any proving has to be done before then.

626
01:19:17,171 --> 01:19:21,231
Yes?
Mrs. McQueen, J.D. needs to be at Mr. Thomas' office by 2:00.

627
01:19:22,233 --> 01:19:25,156
Joe is at the airport. He's gone to New York to see his dad.

628
01:19:26,221 --> 01:19:27,421
The airport?

629
01:19:34,794 --> 01:19:35,994
Come on, come on, come on!

630
01:19:37,467 --> 01:19:39,467
Come on, people, move!

631
01:19:48,039 --> 01:19:52,774
All I know is, your mom said to pick you up at the executive terminal and to get your butt back to school.

632
01:20:03,490 --> 01:20:08,317
Up there is a pretty scary place for most o us.
But Jane seems to think it's your special place.

633
01:22:10,341 --> 01:22:13,896
So, what'd you think?
Pretty difficult.

634
01:22:16,255 --> 01:22:20,815
Ought to be. It's a test to weigh first-year college calculus.

635
01:22:53,497 --> 01:22:55,497
Well, Jane's not gonna like this very much.

636
01:22:59,365 --> 01:23:01,365
You did better than she did.
I did?

637
01:23:13,465 --> 01:23:14,665
Yes!

638
01:23:16,757 --> 01:23:17,957
Here.

639
01:23:18,842 --> 01:23:20,058
It's from Grant.

640
01:23:24,549 --> 01:23:25,749
"J.D McQueen interview".?

641
01:23:36,772 --> 01:23:39,746
Another good friend. Hey, man-- variety. It's the spice of life.

642
01:23:39,747 --> 01:23:44,821
Well, it's good to be J.D. McQueen.
Now, a lot of girls want to know what would it take to be your perfect girl?

643
01:23:45,876 --> 01:23:49,982
Well, she'd have to be realy smart and a good friend but there's algo this--this thing.
This thing?

644
01:23:50,757 --> 01:23:54,717
This thing, I love this one girl's smile. I really do.
I mean, she's amazing.

645
01:23:55,668 --> 01:24:03,192
Listen, I gotta go. It was nice talking to you.
Whoa, sounds pretty heavy.

646
01:24:04,649 --> 01:24:08,311
It wasn't all a lie.
How come that wasn't in the article?

647
01:24:08,312 --> 01:24:12,758
Cause that's not J.D. talking. Tha's Joe.

648
01:24:16,716 --> 01:24:17,916
I want you to wear this.

649
01:24:20,502 --> 01:24:26,256
Oh. Mom. I can't wear that. That's yours.

650
01:24:26,257 --> 01:24:29,257
Every princess needs a necklace.
And a lady in waiting.

651
01:24:30,155 --> 01:24:36,316
And...a chaperon.
Oh, Mary! You look so gorgeous!

652
01:24:39,272 --> 01:24:42,551
Ladies and gentlemen,
J.D McQueen.

653
01:24:54,751 --> 01:24:56,751
What's up, everybody? How y'all doing out there?
You feel good?

654
01:25:03,708 --> 01:25:04,908
Jane, uh, are you out there?

655
01:25:08,156 --> 01:25:09,822
You picked her over me?

656
01:25:10,457 --> 01:25:12,823
How can you do that?? Ohh! Stop it!

657
01:25:16,531 --> 01:25:18,031
Whitney Addison wears a water bra!

658
01:25:31,326 --> 01:25:36,406
Listen, everyone, I'm kicking off summer tour right here, right now, in my hometown.

659
01:25:37,009 --> 01:25:42,661
But if it weren't for some very special people the only thing I'd be kicking off this summer is my shoes.

660
01:25:43,084 --> 01:25:46,227
First off, I'd like to thank my parents...

661
01:25:46,228 --> 01:25:49,089
for always making sure I did my best and not letting me cheat myself out of my full potencial.

662
01:25:50,275 --> 01:25:53,718
Most importantly, I'd like to thank Jane Brightman.

663
01:25:53,719 --> 01:25:56,976
You taught me everything.
Thank you.

664
01:26:06,595 --> 01:26:09,377
Is this seat taken?
Uh,no, please. Ha ha. It's all yours.

665
01:26:22,276 --> 01:26:26,578
The kid's pretty good, isn't he?
Excellent. And he's cute, too.

666
01:26:29,709 --> 01:26:30,909
That kid's got talent.

667
01:26:35,799 --> 01:26:39,725
Justin. My names's Justin.
I used t odate a guy named Justin. My name's London.

668
01:26:56,462 --> 01:27:02,843
Dating many girls makes the heart feel old.
Finding the right woman makes it feel young again.

669
01:27:06,084 --> 01:27:11,657
Uh, did you hear that there's prom coming up?
I never got to go to my prom. I was actually really bummed.

670
01:27:13,009 --> 01:27:18,371
Really? Wll,uh... would you--Idon't know--would you like to go with me?

671
01:27:19,202 --> 01:27:21,372
Sure, that sounds great.
Ohh! Heh!

672
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:30,159
Hi, I'm Grant-- J.D.'s manager.
I'm Faith--Jane's mom.

673
01:27:32,288 --> 01:27:35,098
I was just gonna go get a soda.
You want one?

674
01:27:37,028 --> 01:27:42,368
I'd live one.
That could be the best soda she ever had.

675
01:28:07,337 --> 01:28:09,604
Where have you been? We haven't seen you since the wedding.

676
01:28:12,925 --> 01:28:15,883
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's OK.

677
01:28:16,667 --> 01:28:22,785
It's not your fault. Um, I'm just not ready to be out yet.
I,uh, I need to go home.

678
01:28:51,814 --> 01:28:56,086
Yesterday's history. Tomorrow's a mystery. Today's a gift.

679
01:28:58,650 --> 01:28:59,850
That's why it's called the present.

680
01:29:46,726 --> 01:29:51,183
I always knew you'd do well on the test.
You just needed to be in your own special place.

681
01:29:52,045 --> 01:29:58,393
Actually onstage in front of a whole bunch of empty seats that's my biggest fear.

682
01:29:59,736 --> 01:30:02,736
If I can ace the test there, I can ace the test anywhere.

683
01:30:03,916 --> 01:30:09,306
It's because of you I passed.
Heh. And I finished writing my first story because of you.

684
01:30:10,264 --> 01:30:14,314
Really?
What's it about?

685
01:30:14,315 --> 01:30:16,811
It's a fairy tale about a high school girl who falls in love with a prince.

686
01:30:17,463 --> 01:30:23,214
Don't tell me. They get married, they fell in love, and they live happily--
No, I dont know about that.

687
01:30:23,978 --> 01:30:26,726
Well, how does it end?
With a kiss.

688
01:30:35,094 --> 01:30:37,411
A kiss that could last a lifetime.
