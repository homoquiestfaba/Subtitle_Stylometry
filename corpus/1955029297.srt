01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:20,721
We don't intercept
with Earth at all...

1218
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,211
but we come close enough

1219
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,482
to get a gravity assist
and adjust course.

1220
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:26,483
While we're doing that...

1221
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:30,324
we resupply with the probe...

1222
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:31,481
VINCENT: The Taiyang Shen.

1223
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:33,210
...pick up whatever
provisions we need...

1224
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,522
and now we're accelerating
towards Mars.

1225
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:36,641
(WHOOSHING)

1226
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:39,491
You're Mars.

1227
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:40,721
Now, we're going too fast

1228
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,569
at this point to fall
into orbit...

1229
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:44,091
but we can do a flyby.

1230
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:45,241
<i>What good is a flyby</i>

1231
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:46,731
<i>if we can't get Watney
off the surface?</i>

1232
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:50,164
Watney would intercept
using the MAV.

1233
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:51,321
Ow!

1234
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:53,691
(WHOOSHING)

1235
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:56,888
And then we just head home.

1236
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,604
(WHOOSHING)

1237
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,681
I've done the math.
It checks out.

1238
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,930
<i>SANDERS: Rich.
Yes, sir.</i>

1239
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,047
Get out.

1240
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:09,121
All right.

1241
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,249
Is he right?
VINCENT: Yeah.

1242
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,528
SANDERS: Bruce,
what do you think?

1243
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:21,610
<i>Well, if Vincent says so.</i>

1244
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,247
We need to use
the Taiyang Shen?

1245
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,361
VINCENT: Uh-huh.

1246
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,568
What am I missing?
Why is that important?

1247
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:29,960
Because we can only do one.

1248
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:32,282
Send Watney enough food
to last till Ares 4...

1249
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,369
or send Hermes back
to get him right now.

1250
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,246
Both plans require
the Taiyang Shen,

1251
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,209
so we have to choose.

1252
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,085
But what about
the Hermes crew?

1253
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:41,850
We'd be asking them to add

1254
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:45,049
533 extra days
to their mission.

1255
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,129
Yeah. They wouldn't hesitate,
not for a second.

1256
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:49,924
Can the Hermes function
for 533 days

1257
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:51,286
beyond the scheduled
mission end?

1258
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:52,401
It should.

1259
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,403
Built to last
the full Ares mission...

1260
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,642
so technically, it's only
halfway through its lifespan.

1261
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:58,561
But if something goes wrong...

1262
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,131
Then we lose the crew.

1263
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,004
<i>BRUCE: So what?
We either have a high chance</i>

1264
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:03,849
<i>of killing one person...</i>

1265
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:06,566
<i>or a low chance
of killing six people.</i>

1266
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:08,091
<i>How do we make that decision?</i>

1267
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:10,083
We don't have to
make it, Bruce.

1268
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:11,161
He does.

1269
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:12,647
MITCH: Yeah, Well, bullshit.

1270
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,009
It should be
Commander Lewis' call.

1271
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:16,730
We still have
a chance to bring

1272
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,450
five astronauts
home safe and sound.

1273
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,170
I'm not risking
their lives.

1274
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:22,970
Let them make
that decision.

1275
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:26,365
Mitch, we're going
with option one.

1276
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:30,282
You goddamn coward.

1277
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,448
VOGEL: Johanssen?
Yeah.

1278
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:53,686
I know it's your private time.
Can I bother you for a second?

1279
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:54,801
JOHANSSEN: Yeah, <i>go</i> ahead.

1280
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:55,887
<i>VOGEL: Where are you?</i>

1281
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:56,961
The gym.

1282
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:14,401
(BEEPS)

1283
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:17,245
(PANTING)

1284
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,040
What's up?

1285
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:21,201
I just got an email
from my wife

1286
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:24,244
and the subject line
says, "Our children."

1287
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,562
My computer won't open
the attachment.

1288
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,206
Okay-

1289
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:30,486
Let's take a look.

1290
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,561
Uh...

1291
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,001
Let's see.

1292
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,368
This isn't a JPEG.

1293
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:45,166
It's a plain ASCII text file.

1294
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,286
I don't really know
what we're looking at.

1295
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,365
Does that make
any sense to you?

1296
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:56,842
"Rich Purnell Maneuver."

1297
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,850
It's a course maneuver
for the Hermes.

1298
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:08,086
And the mission concludes
with Earth intercept,

1299
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,201
211 days later.

1300
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:11,971
MARTINEZ: Would it work?

1301
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:14,202
LEWIS: Mmm-hmm. We ran
the numbers. They check out.

1302
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:15,805
BECK: It's a
brilliant course.

1303
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:18,764
So why all
the cloak and dagger?

1304
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,729
Because it goes directly
against NASA's decision.

1305
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,848
Yeah. If we do
the maneuver,

1306
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:25,048
they'd have to send
the supply ship or we die.

1307
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:28,443
We have the opportunity
to force their hand.

1308
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,921
So, are we gonna do it?

1309
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,248
If it was up to me,
we'd already be on our way.

1310
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,482
But it is, though,
isn't it? Up to you.

1311
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:39,161
(CHUCKLES) Not this time.

1312
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:42,290
This is something NASA
expressly rejected.

1313
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:44,884
We're talking about
mutiny here,

1314
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,405
which is not a word
that I take lightly.

1315
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,131
So we do this together
or not at all.

1316
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:52,250
And before you answer,
consider the consequences.

1317
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:55,449
If we mess up the supply
rendezvous, we die.

1318
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:58,405
If we mess up the Earth
gravity assist, we die.

1319
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,649
If we do everything
perfectly...

1320
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:04,929
we add 533 days
to our mission.

1321
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:08,971
533 more days before
we see our families again.

1322
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:13,648
533 days of unplanned
space travel...

1323
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,370
where anything could go wrong.

1324
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,922
If it's mission
critical, we die.

1325
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:20,807
Sign me up.

1326
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,445
All right, cowboy,
slow down.

1327
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,284
You and I, we're military.

1328
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:26,124
Chances are, we go home,
they'll court martial us.

1329
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:27,201
Yeah, there's that.

1330
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:28,406
LEWIS: And for the rest
of you guys...

1331
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:31,404
I guarantee they will never
send you back up here again.

1332
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:35,963
Good. So, if we go
for it, how would it work?

1333
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:37,690
I plot the course
and execute it.

1334
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,126
JOHANSSEN: Remote override.

1335
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,441
They could take
over the Hermes

1336
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:41,800
from Mission Control.

1337
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,968
LEWIS: Can you disable it?

1338
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:47,202
Hermes has four redundant
flight computers...

1339
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:49,687
each connected to three
redundant comm systems.

1340
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,080
We can't shut down
the comms

1341
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:52,685
because we'd lose
telemetry and guidance.

1342
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:54,410
And we can't shut down
the computers

1343
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,164
because we need
to run the ship.

1344
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:59,642
I'd have to disable remote
override on each system.

1345
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,723
It's part of the OS, I'd have
to jump over the code.

1346
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:04,531
Okay, but, like, in English,
what would that mean?

1347
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:07,800
I can do it.

1348
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:09,887
Great.

1349
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,045
Well, it has
to be unanimous.

1350
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:18,482
If we do this, it'll be
over 900 days of space.

1351
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:24,242
That's more than enough
space for one life...

1352
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:26,320
so,yes.

1353
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:28,205
I vote yes.

1354
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:32,045
Let's go get him.

1355
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:35,921
Johanssen?

1356
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:37,601
Yes.

1357
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,126
Yeah!
(ALL CHEERING)

1358
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:40,361
(APPLAUSE)

1359
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:44,366
Got an unscheduled status
update from Hermes.

1360
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:45,521
BRENDAN:
Roger. Read it out.

1361
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:48,365
Message reads,
"Houston, please be advised.

1362
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:50,363
"Rich Purnell
is a steely-eyed missile man."

1363
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:51,441
What?

1364
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,965
GUIDANCE TECHNICIAN:
Flight, Guidance.

1365
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:54,929
Hermes is off-course.

1366
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,366
CAPCOM, advise Hermes
they're drifting.

1367
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:58,044
Guidance, get
a correction ready.

1368
01:30:58,200 --> 01:30:59,167
GUIDANCE TECHNICIAN:
Negative, Flight,

1369
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:00,890
it's not drift.
They've adjusted course.

1370
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:02,201
What the hell?

1371
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:05,603
Telemetry, any chance this is
instrumentation failure?

1372
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,250
Negative, Flight.

1373
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:08,521
Guidance, work at
how long they can stay

1374
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,125
on this course
before it's irreversible.

1375
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:11,884
GUIDANCE TECHNICIAN: Working
on that now, Flight.

1376
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:13,451
(WHISPERS) Hey.
Who's Rich Purnell?

1377
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:15,281
Idunno.

1378
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:17,888
Will somebody find out
who the hell Rich Purnell is?

1379
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:20,568
SANDERS: Annie will go before
the media this morning...

1380
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:22,290
and inform them
of NASA's decision

1381
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,562
to reroute
the Hermes to Mars.

1382
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,084
Sounds like a smart move.

1383
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:30,162
Considering the circumstances.

1384
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:35,482
Whoever gave them the maneuver
only passed along information.

1385
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:37,449
Crew made the decision
on their own.

1386
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:41,083
You may have
killed them, Mitch.

1387
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:44,969
We're fighting the same war.

1388
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:46,565
Every time

Every Ares mission requires
three years of pre-supplies.

1398
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:17,611
So NASA decided a long time
ago it's a lot easier...

1399
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:19,006
to send some
of the stuff beforehand

1400
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:20,360
rather than bring it with us.

1401
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:24,206
So, as a result,
the MAV for Ares 4...

1402
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:25,441
is already there

1403
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:27,164

just waiting.

1404
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:31,320
So the plan is for me to use
that to go into orbit...

1405
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:34,490
just as the Hermes
is passing...

1406
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:37,803

a lot of streamlining.

to matter...

1583
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:42,206
it'll be high enough that
there's practically no air.

If we use 75.5% of remaining

1835
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:13,000
