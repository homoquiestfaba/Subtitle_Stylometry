1
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:40,625
<i>If I had to pick a
yearbook quote, it would be,</i>

2
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,792
<i>"Lonely in life,
popular in death."</i>

3
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:46,559
<i>See that girl flying up in the air?</i>

4
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,250
<i>That's me, Darby Harper.</i>

5
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:52,833
<i>My upbringing was
pretty awesome at first.</i>

6
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,500
<i>That's my mom.</i>

7
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:58,458
<i>I was following in her
iconic cheer footsteps.</i>

8
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:03,917
<i>Back then, I thought I knew who
I was and who I wanted to be.</i>

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,708
- <i>Until everything came crashing down.</i>
- There's Dad.

10
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:09,292
Darby!

11
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,917
<i>My mom and I died
on the same day.</i>

12
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,208
One. Two…

13
00:01:16,292 --> 00:01:19,667
<i>And even though I technically
came back from the other side,</i>

14
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,958
<i>I was never the same.</i>

15
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:29,208
<i>What was different about me?
Are you sitting down for this?</i>

16
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,458
<i>I see dead people.</i>

17
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:35,958
<i>Everywhere.</i>

18
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,250
<i>And it turns out the dead,</i>

19
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:41,125
<i>or "Deados" as I like to
call them,</i> - Excuse me.

20
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:42,917
<i>Actually needed my help.</i>

21
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:45,833
Hey.

22
00:01:45,917 --> 00:01:49,042
<i>So, that's when I turned
my back on the living world</i>

23
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,292
<i>and decided to start
my little side hustle,</i>

24
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,625
- <i>counseling local spirits.</i>
- Hello.

25
00:01:57,792 --> 00:02:01,208
<i>Over time, I learned that not
every person who died stuck around.</i>

26
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:05,250
<i>Only those who have some
unfinished business.</i>

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,958
<i>And this is where I come in…</i>

28
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:13,625
<i>…as a spiritual messenger of sorts,</i>

29
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:19,292
<i>making sure the Deados don't get stuck
in a world that no longer sees them.</i>

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,750
<i>With my assistance, these
spirits were able to cross over,</i>

31
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,708
<i>which is pretty beautiful.</i>

32
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,250
<i>Word spread in the purgatory circuit,
and my after-school job took off.</i>

33
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,542
Hey, how are you?

34
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,083
<i>There's no pay,</i>

35
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:43,042
<i>but if dead people gratitude
had monetary value,</i>

36
00:02:44,042 --> 00:02:45,542
<i>I'd be Jeff Bezos.</i>

37
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,500
<i>You'd think witnessing dead people
say, "Goodbye" over and over again</i>

38
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,292
<i>would be my biggest burden,</i>

39
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,125
<i>but it is a distant second</i>

40
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:05,917
<i>to the torturous realm where I am
forced to spend my days, high school.</i>

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,667
I can't believe you think this is a
better education than homeschooling.

42
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,458
I mean, look at them.

43
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:15,958
Honey, I have a hard time getting
you to come out for dinner.

44
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:17,958
I mean, how else can I
get you to socialize?

45
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:23,417
I make, like, ten new dead friends a
week. How much more social can I get?

46
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,000
I love you.

47
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,208
Love you too.

48
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:28,875
Try to have a good day.

49
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:32,375
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, isn't that Capri Donahue?

50
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:43,458
Honey, I just don't get why
you two stopped hanging out.

51
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:47,167
You were joined at the hip.
Maybe y'all should reconnect.

52
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,708
Oh, no. I lost my
hard-earned smile.

53
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:06,250
It truly amazes me that at the
most formative time of their lives,

54
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,667
a time that should be
about self-discovery,

55
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,708
and finding what is individual
and unique about themselves,

56
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:13,667
they instead choose to
homogenize in groups

57
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,375
that give them the unhealthy
acceptance they so deeply crave.

58
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,167
You're so lucky
your mom let you.

59
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,750
I was going under the knife
for my deviated septum anyway,

60
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:24,375
so we just thought that we'd get
my boobs done at the same time.

61
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:27,708
And that's why I'd rather hang out
with the unliving than the unwoke.

62
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,750
- Gross, sorry.
- Hey, dude,

63
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,625
La Croix eruption at
Mount McMuffin, dude.

64
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,583
Did I mention that I spent last
Friday night discussing modern art

65
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:41,375
with a woman who claimed to be
Frida Kahlo's lover? Just saying.

66
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,500
In the ecosystem of high school,

67
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,125
I'm basically a hermit
crab hiding under a reef.

68
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,292
And I wouldn't have
it any other way.

69
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:58,083
That's my friend, Gary. He's a
"Stayer." A Stayer is a Deado who...

70
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:01,333
- Oh, my God. No way!
- I know. And she said, "Fetch."

71
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:03,375
- Ew.
- Your jacket is really cute, by the way.

72
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,917
Oh, thanks. It's amazing what I can do
with a sewing machine and a little thread.

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,542
Capri Donahue.

74
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:12,333
Head phony. Ever heard of someone
described as having solid character?

75
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:14,708
Oh, my God. The Sweet
Seventeen promo video?

76
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:16,333
- I know.
- Oh, I'm living for it.

77
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:18,333
Well, Capri's is
pure particle board.

78
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:19,458
I know!

79
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:23,000
Good morning, Miss Lyman. You
look like a breath of fresh air.

80
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,167
Kiss ass.

81
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,625
Oh, Darby. Forgot you went here.

82
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:27,875
Hmm.

83
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:31,708
- Babe.
- Jamesy!

84
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:32,792
I missed you.

85
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,917
In case you couldn't tell by that
dramatic <i>Bachelor Nation</i> -style spin,

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,250
that's Capri's boyfriend.

87
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,917
James Harris was a band geek

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,875
who had been completely
invisible to Capri until...

89
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,625
Even though he didn't make it
past the blind audition round,

90
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:58,917
it was enough fame for Capri

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,542
to turn her chair and set
her thirsty hooks in him.

92
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,333
Good morning, newly minted junior class.

93
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:06,583
- Whoo!
- Welcome to biology lab.

94
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:09,792
Before you get too comfortable, I've
paired you up with your lab partner

95
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,208
alphabetically by last name.

96
00:06:11,292 --> 00:06:13,625
Go ahead and take a
seat with that person.

97
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:17,792
I don't even have to look at the list.
Ever since first grade, it's always...

98
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,708
- Harper.
- Harris.

99
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,500
Uh, Miss Lyman, I need to
be partnered with James

100
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,792
because I'm trained to assist
him with his learning disability.

101
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,125
He has dyslexia.

102
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,792
No, he doesn't.

103
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,375
I'm sure James will
manage on his own, Capri.

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,875
Capri knows I'm the one person
she can't get to like her.

105
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,375
I'm the one girl in school
who doesn't wanna be her,

106
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,338
the one person who can
see through her bullshit.

107
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:48,958
Hi, baby.

108
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:52,125
Babe, I'm at a different table.
I'm not going off to war.

109
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,958
Oh, my God. Don't even say that.

110
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:55,833
All right. Let's get started.

111
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:59,542
Uh, excuse me, Miss Lyman?
There's an ass on my desk.

112
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,250
Oh, I'm sorry. This is a fresh blowout.

113
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,542
I didn't even see
anyone was sitting here.

114
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,083
Freak show.

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,625
I'm sorry. She can be a little
extra sometimes.

116
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,208
Extra psychotic.

117
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,208
- I like your Chucks.
- Oh, thanks.

118
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:18,958
Yeah.

119
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,042
James is a good guy.

120
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:25,375
He was actually my first crush back
in sixth grade.

121
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,833
Before I realized that romantic
relationships are just a social construct

122
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:32,250
people created to avoid the fact that
we're all helplessly alone in this world.

123
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:36,250
Mmm. I got you this time.

124
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,333
I do.

125
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,083
- Hmm. Boom.
- Eh, nah, nah, nah, nah. Bishop to e4.

126
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:46,917
Ugh, crap. That's...

127
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,833
Yeah, that's... That
would be checkmate.

128
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:49,917
Mmm.

129
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,417
And that would also
be two more bucks you owe me, kid.

130
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,417
Come on. You don't
even use money.

131
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,542
I know, I know. But I love
to leave it in Linda's purse.

132
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:02,875
She gets a big boost when she finds it.
Treat herself to some fancy coffee drink.

133
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,934
All right. That is
pretty frigging adorable.

134
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,333
All right,
come on. Pay up.

135
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:09,250
I really
wish you took Venmo.

136
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:12,375
I hope you have a
wonderful rest of the day.

137
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,625
Thank you, Gary. I
appreciate it. I'll try.

138
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:28,083
Hey, hi. Uh, you're the girl
from the bleachers, right?

139
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:30,167
Uh, I don't talk
to clients here.

140
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,292
Uh.

141
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,708
Come by my office Friday night,
okay? That's where I work.

142
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:34,958
Work...

143
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:38,708
- Oh, shit.
- Are you okay?

144
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:41,750
I mean, you look like
you've just seen a ghost.

145
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:45,167
The opposite,
actually. I thought you were...

146
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:49,000
Never mind. I just... I
haven't seen you before.

147
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,875
Great. You two found each other.

148
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:55,583
- Alex is new, and he's gonna need…
- Oh, God. Please, no.

149
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,708
…a junior study buddy
to show him the ropes.

150
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,268
He just transferred
in from a Montessori school,

151
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:02,792
so all this is pretty
foreign to him.

152
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,667
Oh, okay. Yeah, I don't know if
I'm the best person to do that.

153
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,958
Sure, you are. You're an honors
student, and you both seem like such...

154
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,667
- He's thinking, "Weirdos."
- Abstract thinkers.

155
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,750
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

156
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:18,083
Extracurricular activities
meet-and-greet starts in ten minutes.

157
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:22,625
Walk Alex through it. Help him
acclimatize.

158
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,500
- That guy. Uh, we're... Yep.
- Yep. Okay.

159
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,750
So, do you have any burning questions
about Frederick Douglass High

160
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,000
I can answer in the
next two minutes?

161
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,958
Uh, that for starters.

162
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,875
Yeah, the superintendent passed a
bill allowing corporate sponsorship

163
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,625
of cafeterias so that schools could
save on the cost of lunches.

164
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,000
Jeez.

165
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,167
My old school didn't have
this type of structure.

166
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,833
You know, the bell telling
you when and where to go,

167
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:54,333
having to raise your hand to
get permission to take a leak.

168
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:57,167
Public school is only a few
rules away from the Marines.

169
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,417
Yeah. That's funny.

170
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:03,292
So, why did you
leave Montessori?

171
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:08,167
I had a bit of a rough patch last
year. You know, some issues, so...

172
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,458
I feel your pain,
junior class buddy.

173
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:12,167
So, who do you hang with?

174
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,625
Uh, I don't.

175
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,458
Oh. The lone wolf.

176
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,042
You said something
earlier about your work?

177
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,958
Oh, no. N... It was
nothing.

178
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:23,417
I thought you were someone else.

179
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,333
Um, I do some social
work on Friday nights.

180
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,583
Social work?

181
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:30,917
When in doubt, the truth gets
people to bug off every time.

182
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,375
Yeah. Yeah, it's for dead people. I
help them pass on to the next realm.

183
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,083
Uh...

184
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:40,208
That's really cool. I'm actually
into psychic mediums too.

185
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:43,000
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. What are the odds?

186
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,083
That backfired.

187
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:47,292
So, uh, are you
in any of these clubs?

188
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,375
Maybe in another lifetime.

189
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,378
At my old school, I had
a Stephen King book club.

190
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,458
Oh, uh-huh.

191
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:54,542
But you know, if I'm forced
to be here, which I am,

192
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:59,208
I've decided I want the most public
school experience ever known to man.

193
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:02,000
Wow. You're quite
the glass half-full guy.

194
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:06,208
I mean, if you don't embrace
the absurdities in life, right?

195
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:07,292
It's unlivable.

196
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,250
Mmm.

197
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,375
Ooh, prom. I've seen
that in the movies.

198
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:15,417
Uh, I gotta run.

199
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,917
Oh. Okay, uh...

200
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,875
I-I'd love to talk to you more
about the paranormal stuff.

201
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,292
Lone wolf, Alex.

202
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,542
- "Lone" being the key adjective there.
- Right.

203
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,333
Yeah. See you.

204
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:32,958
Yeah.

205
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,375
Mmm. That's not good.

206
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,208
All right. Listen up, people.

207
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:41,292
We got a few cheerleaders here who want
to do a special presentation just for you.

208
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,208
And action!

209
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:44,625
Let's go.

210
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,125
Hi, Cougars! I'm Capri
Donahue, and this is...

211
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,208
Taylor.

212
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,125
Taylor, Bree, Piper and Todd.

213
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:55,875
And we're here to tell all the gym
classes about cheer tryouts next week.

214
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,417
Here's a little skit we
prepared. Hope you enjoy!

215
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:00,292
Hi! Are you new here?

216
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,042
Yes, I'm a freshman.

217
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,458
And I've always dreamed of being

218
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:06,750
a cheerleader, but I'm
so intimidated by it.

219
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,625
Isn't it just for
shallow, hot girls?

220
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,917
I'm so glad you asked. And the
answer is, that's offensive.

221
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,958
Cheerleaders aren't just pretty
people who are happy all the time.

222
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:17,625
We face the same
challenges. Just like you.

223
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,917
Really? Even you,
the head cheerleader?

224
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,750
- Yes, even me.
- Yeah.

225
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,083
But cheer allows us to be
the change that we wanna see.

226
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:27,000
We support female
empowerment, just like Beyoncé.

227
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,333
When one of us falls...

228
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:30,833
- The sisterhood is there to catch us.
- Jesus.

229
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,708
Next week, I'll be there.

230
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:34,125
Piper, at the end.

231
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,208
But cheer keeps
the world moving.

232
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:37,917
Because when something
gets us down...

233
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,250
- Cheer...
- Lifts us back up.

234
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,292
Let's hear it, Cougars!

235
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:50,292
Tryouts next
week, show us what you can do.

236
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:52,292
Tryouts next week!

237
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,833
- Now, Piper!
- "Now," what?

238
00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:55,250
Next week? I'll be there.

239
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,167
- Shit.
- Whoo!

240
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,167
- Let's go, Cougars!
- Whoo!

241
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,167
My dad said I can only invite
50 people, but I was, like,

242
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,750
"Come on, the DJ tent
holds at least a hundo."

243
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,917
Ugh! Can we get a
corporate sponsor from…

244
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:14,417
…the electric company or
something? This is ridiculous.

245
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:19,167
Give me my clothes.

246
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:22,958
Why would I take your clothes? Not
planning on attending a funeral.

247
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:27,625
I have no problem walking up to
Principal Morgan's office in my towel

248
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,000
to discuss his zero
tolerance bullying policy.

249
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,542
Oh, my God! You're totally
gaslighting me right now.

250
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,958
You're the one who bullied me in front
of the entire class this morning.

251
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:37,583
You called me an ass.

252
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:40,917
Technically, I called
your actual ass an ass.

253
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,958
Maybe you'll understand that more when
we get to the anatomy section of bio lab.

254
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,625
It was just a joke. No need to go
crying to the principal, freak show.

255
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:59,167
Ow! My ass.

256
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,417
- Capri!
- Are you okay?

257
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,917
I'm fine. Just...
I slipped.

258
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:14,583
Miss Harper, thank you so
much for giving us your statement.

259
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:17,583
We'll be in touch if we have
any follow-up questions.

260
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,000
Miss Harper?

261
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,625
Uh... Yeah, yes.
Okay.

262
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:23,708
Okay.

263
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:26,542
All right, ladies.

264
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,333
Go home, get some rest.

265
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,417
Remember, we have grief
counselors available.

266
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,625
Seeing a dead person is a
very traumatic experience

267
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,750
which none of us
are equipped for.

268
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,625
Sorry.

269
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,250
Something in the
throat.

270
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:59,042
Hey.

271
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,125
Hey.

272
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,542
Yeah. She was a beauty.

273
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:16,083
I know you don't like
talking about your mom.

274
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,542
And I'm not trying to push you.

275
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:26,125
I know Capri's death is
probably a trigger. Right?

276
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:29,458
No. No, really. I'm... I'm fine.

277
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,042
Honey.

278
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,125
I'm just tired.

279
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,458
So... But thank you.

280
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:42,875
Night.

281
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,750
- I love you.
- Love you.

282
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:11,958
Wake up, bitch. Wake up!

283
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:14,417
Oh, goddamn it.

284
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,583
So it's true. You can see me.

285
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:20,792
How did
you even... Uh...

286
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,750
Remember groundskeeper Gary?

287
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,375
- Uh...
- Yeah.

288
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,000
He told me all about
your little "ability."

289
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,583
Bring me back.

290
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:29,667
Darby!

291
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,250
Bring me back. Now!

292
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:37,375
Capri, I can't bring you back.
I can only help you move on.

293
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:39,292
Move on?

294
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,125
No. Cheer tryouts are next week.

295
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,958
My Sweet Seventeen is
coming up in a month.

296
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:47,958
I've planned it the whole year. It
costs more than my sister's wedding.

297
00:16:48,042 --> 00:16:50,542
Denial.
It's the hardest stage.

298
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,708
Listen, I'm...
…I'm really sorry you died.

299
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:57,042
I truly am. But you are dead,

300
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,833
and neither I, nor anyone
else can bring you back.

301
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,792
Holy crap!

302
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,833
Did I do that?

303
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:14,792
- Am I coming back to life?
- No, dude, you're a form of energy.

304
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,250
So, with intense
focus and practice,

305
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,583
or I guess just pure,
unfiltered teenage rage,

306
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:22,000
Deados can manipulate
things in the real world.

307
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,625
- "Deados?"
- Yeah. Yeah, that's what I call your kind.

308
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,583
The in-betweeners like you.

309
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:31,208
Okay, but-but-but
what about, um, Gary?

310
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,167
- I mean, he died our freshman year, right?
- Yeah.

311
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,208
He's a Stayer. It means
he chooses to be here.

312
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:40,292
He's waiting for his wife to die
so they can pass on together.

313
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:46,292
Okay, cute. Um. Then,
I will be a Stayer too.

314
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:51,125
Yeah. I don't wanna go to some…
…creepy afterlife. No, thank you.

315
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,417
No, no. Capri, this is not
where you're meant to be,

316
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,083
so it'll be very difficult
for you to be at peace here.

317
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,800
Especially you, feeling like you're
missing out on all that stupid shit

318
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,667
you think is so important.

319
00:18:02,292 --> 00:18:04,667
Oh, it might be stupid
shit to you, freak show,

320
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,792
but this is the best
year of my life.

321
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,708
Everyone thinks senior
year is peak, but no.

322
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:11,000
Seniors have one foot
out the door to college.

323
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:15,542
I am at the epicenter of the
ultimate high school experience.

324
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,375
I'm not
going anywhere.

325
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,708
You literally will never be
able to see yourself again.

326
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:24,542
You're dead.

327
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,208
So is all that shit
you care about.

328
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:31,500
Cheer championships,
homecoming, your birthday.

329
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,125
You can't experience it anymore.

330
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,208
I'm sorry.

331
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,375
Look, I can deliver whatever
message you want to whomever.

332
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:50,292
But once you make the decision
to move on, you move on.

333
00:18:54,792 --> 00:18:57,792
Look, you can stay here
tonight if you're freaked out.

334
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,667
But I'm going to sleep
because, well, I'm alive,

335
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,875
and I have another day
of living hell tomorrow.

336
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:06,750
I'm sorry you died.

337
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:13,167
<i>I'm Katlyn Kelley, reporting live
from Frederick Douglass High School,</i>

338
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,417
<i>where yesterday, students witnessed
the shocking and tragic death</i>

339
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,875
<i>of their popular classmate,
head cheerleader,</i>

340
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,208
Capricorn Donahue.

341
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:23,250
I'm on TV, and
I can't even enjoy it.

342
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:26,250
Grieving students have
been visiting this memorial

343
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,167
for the beloved cheerleader.

344
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:32,250
Could you tell us a little about
what made Capri so special?

345
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:36,292
She was an amazing
person and such a great friend.

346
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,208
And I'm just gonna
miss her so much.

347
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:40,458
I've literally never seen
you before in my life.

348
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:44,042
Capri was planning a big Sweet
Seventeen birthday for next month.

349
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,792
Can you tell us more about that?

350
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,667
Yeah, she
was so excited about the party.

351
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,792
She put everything she
had into planning it.

352
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,292
Oh, guys! I'm still
here...

353
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:57,750
Is there anything else you would
like our viewers to know about Capri?

354
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:03,083
Just that she was the glue that
bonded together our sisterhood.

355
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,708
She was actually a Scorpio.

356
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:11,417
<i>Also, follow us on
Instagram. Thank you.</i>

357
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:16,875
<i>A young spark of life, gone in
a flash. A cheer heard no more.</i>

358
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:20,042
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Maybe you should stay at home.

359
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,583
<i>Signing off.</i>

360
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:23,583
Nah, it's just putting
off the inevitable.

361
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,792
That's the photo
you brought to my shrine?

362
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:30,708
Taylor, you look adorable, and
my eyes are literally closed!

363
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,417
Did you guys see that?

364
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,833
That practice killed me.
Capri would have been so proud.

365
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:52,875
Nationals,
here we come!

366
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,292
So, where
are we going tonight?

367
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,083
I just can't believe
that she's gone.

368
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:04,000
I had my nose
modeled after hers.

369
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:07,458
I heard she shot 50 feet in the
air, and her pants flew off.

370
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:10,125
Do you think James Harris
will rejoin jazz band now?

371
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,417
"Dead Cheerleader"
is a killer name for a band.

372
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,208
Alive Capricorn Donahue was
an "it girl," but dead Capri Donahue?

373
00:21:17,292 --> 00:21:19,167
Oh, she's a legend, honey.

374
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,250
Hey, here she is...
Hey, Darby. My buddy, Mel.

375
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,792
- Hi.
- He passed last night.

376
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,333
- Uh, heart attack.
- Yeah.

377
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:28,292
- Oh. Sorry.
- You know. So if you don't mind,

378
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,500
he's gonna sit and watch
our lunchtime chess games

379
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,875
- until you can help him move on.
- Yeah, sure.

380
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,667
My wife, Deb, uh, she
passed 17 years ago,

381
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,292
and you know,
that's a long time.

382
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,333
I was in a lot better
shape then, right?

383
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:41,167
Uh, what if she's not

384
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,958
- attracted to me anymore?
- Maybe.

385
00:21:43,042 --> 00:21:45,750
Well, I like to think
that when you pass on,

386
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,542
you pass as your optimal self.

387
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,667
And I'm pretty sure that has nothing
to do with your superficial exterior.

388
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,625
Oh, my optimal self?

389
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,750
- Yeah.
- I like that.

390
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,958
Okay.

391
00:21:57,042 --> 00:21:59,417
- Well, we'll talk soon.
- Way to be, Darby. Thank you.

392
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,667
- She is good!
- I told you, huh?

393
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,042
Oh, no.

394
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,083
Oh, thank God.

395
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,458
- Hola! Oh!
- Oh! Jeez...

396
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:20,208
- God, you scared the shit out of me.
- Oh. Sorry.

397
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:21,292
Are you okay?

398
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,083
Yeah, fine. I...

399
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,500
It's just someone I'm
trying to avoid.

400
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:29,000
Oh. Got a little
stalker?

401
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,542
Potentially.

402
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:32,042
Oh, you're serious.

403
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,625
Oh, my bad. Okay. Uh…

404
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,083
You wanna talk about it?

405
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:42,250
Well, the frustrating thing is, is I
don't think anyone would understand.

406
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:43,583
Mmm. I get that.

407
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:48,042
Don't have to explain anything to
me, I'm just making sure you're okay.

408
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:50,042
Thanks.

409
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:53,208
- Um...
- So, what's up?

410
00:22:53,292 --> 00:22:55,750
So, you were there with
the cheerleader yesterday?

411
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,667
That's pretty intense.

412
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,625
Yeah.

413
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:02,792
Whoo! Sorry, Alex.
Too much caffeine.

414
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:06,542
Uh, sorry. Uh, I... I gotta go
but I'll s... Thanks for the...

415
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:07,625
Just thanks.

416
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:09,833
- I need to talk to you.
- Okay.

417
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:11,833
I don't work at school, Capri.

418
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:15,167
What do you mean, "Work"? I'm
not asking you to do my taxes.

419
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,250
Okay, what do you want?

420
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:25,500
I have decided that I do,
in fact, want to move on.

421
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:28,042
It's incredibly boring being
here and being invisible.

422
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:30,125
Also, apparently, I'm
stuck in this outfit.

423
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,726
If I knew I was gonna die, I
would've worn way more accessories.

424
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,833
Smart decision. Come
see me Friday night.

425
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,208
Whoa! I haven't told you
when I wanna move on.

426
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,000
Okay, I don't have
time for this.

427
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,750
It'll be next month.
After my Sweet Seventeen.

428
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:45,792
No. No, just go to your funeral.
Yeah, everyone will be crying

429
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:48,333
and talking about how awesome
you were. You'll love it.

430
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:50,875
Ew, no. I hate funerals,
they're mad depressing.

431
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:53,500
I want the party. Which
is where you come in.

432
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,750
You're gonna make sure
the party still happens.

433
00:23:57,458 --> 00:24:01,250
I think that curling iron incident
fried your last remaining brain cell.

434
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,625
I...

435
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:09,792
Game on.

436
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,833
Ideally, you'll do
this voluntarily.

437
00:24:12,917 --> 00:24:16,208
But I've been practicing the whole
manipulation of objects thing all morning.

438
00:24:16,292 --> 00:24:19,167
So, I can make life very weird
for you if it comes down to it.

439
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,542
Psycho.

440
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,583
I just wanted
to let you know.

441
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:25,375
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's okay, Darby.

442
00:24:26,542 --> 00:24:29,125
As I was saying, James
will not be in today.

443
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:31,458
For obvious reasons.

444
00:24:31,542 --> 00:24:36,000
Bree, Taylor, Piper, my condolences.
I know you girls were very close.

445
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:38,625
She really would've wanted
us to be here today.

446
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:40,958
To remember her
with everyone else.

447
00:24:41,042 --> 00:24:43,542
That's true. I mean, they're no
good to me crying in private.

448
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:47,875
All right. Let's get started.
If you uncover the tray in front of you,

449
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:49,667
you'll find today's project.

450
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,059
- Ugh.
- Gross!

451
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:52,958
- Cool!
- I'm reporting this to PETA.

452
00:24:53,042 --> 00:24:54,292
I'm sorry, buddy.

453
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:56,542
Um, Darby, I wanted to
see if you wouldn't mind

454
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:59,250
dropping off James's lab
homework for him until he's back.

455
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,625
Oh. Uh, I don't really
think that'd be approp...

456
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,625
- What? Say yes!
- Yes, of course.

457
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:04,833
Oh, my God.

458
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:08,708
Capri's Sweet Seventeen promo video
has over, like, 200,000 views.

459
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:10,750
- Really?
- Yeah. They played it on the news.

460
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:13,500
It's so tragic that it's canceled.

461
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:15,292
Darby!

462
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:16,917
Don't ignore me.

463
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:20,208
Hey! I'm serious.

464
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:27,250
- Hmm.
- What are you doing? Stop.

465
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:29,958
- Help me get the party back on.
- No.

466
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:34,458
- Stop it.
- Darby, is everything okay?

467
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:35,750
Yes, fine.

468
00:25:40,292 --> 00:25:42,417
- Ew. Gross!
- Oh, my God.

469
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,976
- What the f...
- Oh... I'm...

470
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,583
Sorry, my hand slipped.

471
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:47,333
Haven't you done enough?

472
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:49,333
Excuse me. I don't feel well.

473
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:51,083
- My God.
- What just happened?

474
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:52,917
- Okay, class. Carry on.
- Oh, my God.

475
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
What a freak.

476
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:55,917
- Clearly, she needs therapy.
- Hmm.

477
00:25:58,917 --> 00:26:00,625
What the hell are
you doing to me?

478
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:02,542
- Just say you'll help me.
- No.

479
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:06,167
What are you... No!

480
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:10,958
No! No, no, no, no!

481
00:26:11,042 --> 00:26:13,458
No! No, no!

482
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:16,500
- Sorry, I just really have to pee.
- Mm-hmm.

483
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:23,708
- No. What are you... No!
- It's just till the party's back on.

484
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:26,417
No way in hell!

485
00:26:28,917 --> 00:26:30,637
Stop. No. Capri!

486
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:32,250
Stop, stop!

487
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:33,542
No, no, no, no!

488
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:41,792
A public toilet?

489
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:45,125
I could've contracted any
number of deadly diseases.

490
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:46,542
This is criminal bullying.

491
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:48,833
I think it's criminally
good haunting.

492
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:50,625
Fine. You know what? Have at it.

493
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:53,708
I'll just keep ignoring you until
I'm committed to a psych ward.

494
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:56,750
Or you could help me
and be free in a month.

495
00:26:56,833 --> 00:27:00,000
All I want is to go to this party.
To see my friends having fun,

496
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:02,250
and to dance next to
James one last time.

497
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:03,792
And then I'll move on.

498
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:08,000
- I promise.
- And in what worldly dimension

499
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:09,833
do you think I can
throw your dream party?

500
00:27:09,917 --> 00:27:12,167
Me, the girl you
call, "Freak show"?

501
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,917
In a world where I make you
popular enough to do it.

502
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:21,208
<i>I'm gonna let you
in on a little secret.</i>

503
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:22,917
<i>Being popular is an illusion.</i>

504
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,917
<i>Like a magic trick,
or cryptocurrency.</i>

505
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,375
<i>You just have to believe in
it. And then they will too.</i>

506
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:33,542
First, you'll need to get
close to Taylor and Bree,

507
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:35,684
so you can convince them to
throw the party in my honor.

508
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:37,333
Yeah, that
sounds attainable,

509
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:39,750
since they hate me with the
passion of a thousand suns.

510
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:43,875
Excuse me. You won't be able to
avoid them once you join cheer.

511
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:46,458
Never.

512
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,542
Aw, look at us little nuggets
in our cheesy matching uniforms.

513
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:54,375
Hey, get outta there.

514
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:56,958
I forgot we were even
friends that summer.

515
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,917
Then you were all weird
when we got back to school.

516
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,125
Oh, sorry. I was just going through
a little thing called my mom died.

517
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:10,125
Your mom was so boss.

518
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:15,667
Top of the pyramid
at the '93 Nationals.

519
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:21,125
Did she come to you
too after she died?

520
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:23,250
Get out.

521
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:25,500
Okay! Touchy subject.

522
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:29,375
But don't you think that she'd want
you to be like she was in that picture?

523
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,000
Happy? Smiling? Do
you even have teeth?

524
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:34,500
You're really
blowing your pitch, Capri.

525
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:35,958
Well, I just don't understand

526
00:28:36,042 --> 00:28:38,417
why you wouldn't wanna be,
at the very least, normal.

527
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,625
Well, I'm not normal.

528
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:43,000
I've spent my childhood being
a travel agent for dead people.

529
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:46,042
Okay, and? We all have baggage.

530
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:50,542
Yeah, like getting zits and wondering
if anyone will ask you to prom.

531
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:52,125
Deep.

532
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:55,833
You're the most judgmental and
self-righteous person I've ever met.

533
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:58,292
What? No, I'm not.

534
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:01,333
Okay, then prove it. If you really
don't care what people think about you,

535
00:29:01,417 --> 00:29:04,542
then what does it matter if you hang
out with the popular crew for a month

536
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:05,958
or less, even?

537
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:13,250
So, as soon as the
party is back on, do you promise to leave?

538
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:15,958
Do I have your word you'll
leave after the party?

539
00:29:16,042 --> 00:29:19,833
Okay, yes. I promise. Cross my
heart and hope to die. Again.

540
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:23,000
Okay, fine.

541
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:24,083
Yes!

542
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:29,000
The first order of business
is a full head-to-toe glow up.

543
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:31,375
Hey.

544
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:34,750
- What's wrong with this?
- It's a lot of black, Darbs.

545
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:38,917
No.

546
00:29:40,917 --> 00:29:42,375
My God. Burn that.

547
00:29:45,542 --> 00:29:46,875
What's all this stuff?

548
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:49,542
My mom's old clothes
from the '90s.

549
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:51,167
Retro.

550
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:53,958
I dig it!

551
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,458
Darby, stop it.

552
00:29:56,917 --> 00:30:00,375
Ooh, it's a two-piece suit.
Oh, it's a suit.

553
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:01,625
Darby.

554
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:06,500
Stay still.

555
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:08,833
Nope. No.

556
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:18,583
Congratulations.

557
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:23,250
You actually look kind of hot!
You need to post a selfie.

558
00:30:24,042 --> 00:30:25,042
To what?

559
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:28,708
What are you, an
alien? Or Amish or something?

560
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:31,500
- <i>I found out to be popular…</i>
- Here.

561
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:33,792
<i>…you need to post
a lot of selfies.</i>

562
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,625
Hold it. Find your angles.

563
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:39,375
- You've never taken...
- What is... What's my angle?

564
00:30:40,292 --> 00:30:42,458
<i>Some selfies should be silly.</i>

565
00:30:42,542 --> 00:30:45,434
<i>And you should test out every filter
until your eyes lose all perspective,</i>

566
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:47,625
<i>and you pick one where it
looks like you have jaundice.</i>

567
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:54,292
Using too many emojis comes
off as desperate and thirsty.

568
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:59,375
But three carefully curated emojis,
radiates sophistication and class.

569
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:03,458
Eggplants? Penises.
Kitty cats? Vaginas.

570
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:05,958
And a peach is a butt.

571
00:31:06,542 --> 00:31:11,167
Well that certainly changes the meaning of
that text I sent my grandma this morning.

572
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,958
Just keep the captions simple.

573
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:18,250
Two hours and 88 photos later,

574
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:20,833
I had six usable selfies
posted to my feed.

575
00:31:23,042 --> 00:31:25,833
If you don't embarrass
yourself on Instagram,

576
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,542
maybe I'll train you on TikTok.

577
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:29,958
Don't... Don't do that.

578
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:33,708
I can imagine James
trying to block the party,

579
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,726
thinking the girls are only
doing it for followers.

580
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,792
- So you'll have to get him on board, okay?
- I'll try.

581
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:42,708
Here it is. Aw, the
tree house of love.

582
00:31:42,792 --> 00:31:44,792
That was our favorite
make-out spot.

583
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,500
Barf.

584
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:52,167
Oh, Mrs. Harris? Hi, it's Darby.
I brought James's homework.

585
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:55,500
Oh, go right on up. He
hasn't left his room all day.

586
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:15,583
Darby?

587
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:16,750
Jamesy.

588
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:20,917
Hi, Jamesy... I mean, James.
I brought your homework.

589
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,417
You look different.

590
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:28,750
Yeah, yeah. My cousin just
started cosmetology school

591
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:31,875
- and needed a guinea pig.
- Nice. Natural liar.

592
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:36,583
- I love you.
- Sorry, it's such a mess in here.

593
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:38,458
- Just let me clean it up.
- Oh. No worries.

594
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:40,542
He listens to oldies.

595
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,625
Isn't it adorable?

596
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:44,375
I'm
really sorry about Capri.

597
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:46,917
I know she loved you a lot.

598
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,750
Didn't you hate each other?

599
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:52,708
Hmm. Love-hate. We were
close when we were younger.

600
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:56,125
And we still talk, sometimes.
Uh, talked, sometimes.

601
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:58,958
Oh. Right, I didn't
realize that.

602
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:03,833
It's so weird, like
I... I know she's gone,

603
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:06,125
but it still feels like
she's here with me.

604
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:09,750
I mean, she was the most kind,
selfless person I've ever met.

605
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:11,125
Really?

606
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:15,083
I mean, really.
Yeah. I totally get that.

607
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:17,875
And when I didn't make it
past the blinds on <i>The Voice</i> …

608
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,833
…I felt
like such a loser.

609
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:23,417
But when I came back to
school, Capri helped me realize

610
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,292
that failures are just life's
way of making you stronger.

611
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:28,500
It's true. I was so supportive.

612
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:30,833
I'm sorry.
I'm rambling.

613
00:33:30,917 --> 00:33:35,750
No. It's okay, really. I get it.
My mom died when I was seven.

614
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:40,625
Yeah, I remember. Can't even
imagine how hard that's gotta be.

615
00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:44,250
Yeah. It's just so disorienting,

616
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:47,708
like, one day your whole
world is flipped upside down

617
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:50,042
and it feels like you're
on Mars or something,

618
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:52,208
and you don't know how
to feel normal again.

619
00:33:52,292 --> 00:33:53,292
Yeah.

620
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:55,583
That's totally how it feels.

621
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:58,167
Uh, I should go.

622
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,542
Look, thank you for
bringing that over.

623
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:04,333
It was nice to actually
talk to someone.

624
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,042
Hey, Darby.

625
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:14,833
<i>Death has a funny way of teaching
you what's most important.</i>

626
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:17,708
<i>Like finally making
that apology.</i>

627
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:20,375
<i>Encouraging your child
to embrace who they are.</i>

628
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:24,000
<i>And the one that always gets
me, that final, "I love you."</i>

629
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:27,958
<i>The Deados never asked for
anything petty or superficial…</i>

630
00:34:28,042 --> 00:34:29,750
<i>…until now.</i>

631
00:34:33,042 --> 00:34:34,083
Whoa!

632
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,208
Good morning, sweetheart.

633
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:39,042
Morning. Don't make
it a thing, okay?

634
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:41,750
It's just a temporary
experiment for social studies.

635
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:44,625
- It's just...
- What?

636
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,000
You look like your mom.

637
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:56,875
Okay, this is weird.
What is happening?

638
00:34:57,583 --> 00:34:59,833
Who is that? I want her butt.

639
00:34:59,917 --> 00:35:02,750
Damn, smoke show. You got steez.

640
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:04,583
Who is that? Is
that Darby Harper?

641
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:06,750
- What is everyone looking at?
- You, dummy.

642
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:08,542
Shoulders back, head up, walk.

643
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:11,625
Who's the new chick?

644
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:16,875
That's head-to-toe
vintage. Who's that girl?

645
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:20,375
I don't know. But she's serving '90s
realness, and I'm so here for it.

646
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:23,500
- Don't scowl, smile a little.
- They like you. Let them in.

647
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,750
Okay, don't smile. Um,
try pouty. Cute pouty.

648
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:29,958
How?

649
00:35:30,667 --> 00:35:34,708
- God, she is fire.
- Super fresh.

650
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:43,375
Is she wearing a couch cover?

651
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:44,708
Hey.

652
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:48,542
Darby? You look different.

653
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:50,750
I mean a good
different.

654
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,417
I mean, you always look great.

655
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,375
- You wanna have a seat?
- Yeah.

656
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:56,000
No.

657
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:59,958
- Um...
- Darby, no. Absolutely not.

658
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:04,750
Is she trying
to sit with the new guy?

659
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:06,708
No. Uh, no.

660
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,458
- Stupid chair. Come on.
- No.

661
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,792
You know, I'll just stand.
Yeah, it's better for digestion.

662
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:15,833
Hey, hey, new girl. You wanna
come, uh, eat lunch with us?

663
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:18,167
That's Todd. He's the cutest
guy in the cheer squad.

664
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,042
- You should definitely sit with us.
- No.

665
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:21,500
Oh.

666
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:24,333
No, what?

667
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:28,500
No, I forgot that I have
something to get from my locker.

668
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:30,042
No time for lunch.

669
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:34,167
Darby! Hey, Darby!

670
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,625
- What?
- What are you doing?

671
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:38,917
Go sit at Todd's table.
Don't be such a weirdo.

672
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,208
Well, I am a weirdo.

673
00:36:40,292 --> 00:36:43,833
My anonymity was my only means
of survival in this place.

674
00:36:43,917 --> 00:36:46,667
- I'm done.
- No. We have a deal.

675
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,958
Oh, right.
Your brilliant plan.

676
00:36:55,292 --> 00:36:56,625
Hey.

677
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:59,333
- What are you doing?
- You wanna know what I was thinking?

678
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:02,167
Even though you hate me, I could
sit at your table at lunch,

679
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,833
join cheer and we could all
become besties.

680
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:08,792
Have you gone fully mental?

681
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:10,833
What? You don't
wanna be my friend

682
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:14,208
just 'cause I got a new
haircut and some lip gloss?

683
00:37:14,292 --> 00:37:16,000
Oh, my God.

684
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:19,167
There, I tried.

685
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,000
Your new style is hideous.

686
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:24,875
You wouldn't know real
fashion if it bit you on the tit.

687
00:37:25,792 --> 00:37:27,208
I thought it was cool.

688
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:28,875
- I like her socks.
- Guys.

689
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:30,601
What the hell was that back there?

690
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:33,208
You have zero chill. You need
to get your shit together.

691
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,417
I'm crawling back into
my hermit shell tomorrow.

692
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,000
Why are you
such a defeatist?

693
00:37:38,917 --> 00:37:41,375
Oh, Darby, what are you doing?

694
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:44,083
- You've just left your king wide open.
- Defeatist is right.

695
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:46,542
This is like watching <i>The
Queen's Gambit</i>. Except she sucks.

696
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:48,458
- Hey, hey. Darby, girl.
- Burn.

697
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:52,083
Why don't you just do the cheer
thing? You know you want to.

698
00:37:52,167 --> 00:37:54,792
It'll be good, you'll meet
new friends. Ones with pulses.

699
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:56,792
Yeah. And if you follow my plan,

700
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:59,000
then you'll earn their
respect organically.

701
00:38:01,542 --> 00:38:02,750
And if I refuse?

702
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,333
- Oh... Oh, my...
- Whoa!

703
00:38:07,417 --> 00:38:09,750
Bitch, was that a
frog? What the hell!

704
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:14,167
I've been saving him since science class.
I am not giving up on my party, Darby.

705
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,667
There's more where that came from.

706
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,542
Damn it! Fine! Fine.

707
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:22,167
But this is a hostage situation,

708
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,542
and that is on your karma
report card, not mine.

709
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:26,458
Cheer tryouts are
less than a week away.

710
00:38:26,542 --> 00:38:29,333
We're training every day during
lunch and after school. Hey!

711
00:38:29,417 --> 00:38:31,833
Your days of chess
and donuts, over.

712
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:34,583
Donuts. I will miss them.

713
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Hmm.

714
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:43,792
Four.

715
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:46,750
You gonna do anything?

716
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:48,833
Excuse me?

717
00:38:48,917 --> 00:38:50,750
Eight. Nine.

718
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:54,958
Three. Five. Seven. Again.

719
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:56,042
Everything okay?

720
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:58,542
Yeah, just need a sec to focus.

721
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:03,875
I haven't done this since,
well, you know, since my mom.

722
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:24,250
- Hey, fresh homework.
- Thanks.

723
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:25,333
No problem.

724
00:40:02,458 --> 00:40:05,083
What's up? Did you hurt your ankle?

725
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:08,583
It's fine. It's nothing, I
just... I don't like the beach.

726
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:13,958
You're gonna kill it
at tryouts tomorrow.

727
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:18,833
You're the best tumbler I've ever seen,
and I've been to Nationals, twice.

728
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:24,167
Why did you quit
when we were younger?

729
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,667
You're honestly a natural,
just like she was.

730
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,750
I don't wanna talk
about my mother.

731
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,250
Why?

732
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:35,250
You know, I used to wish I
had your mom instead of mine.

733
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:39,292
At least your mom waited till
she was dead to ignore you.

734
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:43,125
Sometimes I think she
might have stayed.

735
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:48,542
But if she did, then
why... Forget it.

736
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:51,833
If she had stayed,
then why what?

737
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:54,000
I don't wanna talk
about my mom, okay?

738
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,250
Okay.

739
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,542
Do you wanna scream
about her instead?

740
00:41:04,292 --> 00:41:05,583
What?

741
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:08,417
I said, do you
want to scream about her?

742
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,500
Cut it out.

743
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:14,083
No. I think you'll feel a lot better
if you just scream a little bit!

744
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:16,292
Stop.

745
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:18,667
Come on!

746
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,042
Stop.

747
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:22,875
Are we gonna make
the team tomorrow, Darby Harper?

748
00:41:24,042 --> 00:41:25,292
Yes.

749
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:30,708
I said, are we
gonna make the team tomorrow?

750
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:33,000
Yes! Yes! Okay?

751
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:34,792
- Yes!
- Yes!

752
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:38,250
Okay! That's what
I'm talking about!

753
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:42,917
I'm
gonna make the team!

754
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:47,375
You're gonna make the team!

755
00:41:47,458 --> 00:41:50,833
All right. For those of you who don't
know who I am, I am Coach Paula.

756
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:52,000
You gotta be kidding me.

757
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:54,417
And we have some
very exciting news.

758
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,083
So, without further ado,

759
00:41:56,167 --> 00:41:58,083
he's your mascot and mine…

760
00:41:58,167 --> 00:42:00,250
…Douglas The Donut!

761
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:01,833
- Look at this guy.
- Come on.

762
00:42:01,917 --> 00:42:04,917
Oh, my God! So cute. Go, Dougie!

763
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,292
Oh, wow.

764
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:11,917
Time
to rumble, time to go nuts!

765
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,042
- Time to cheer for the Fighting Donuts!
- She's pretty good.

766
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:28,875
- Oh.
- Oh, nice try.

767
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:29,958
Let me see it.

768
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:32,125
Show 'em your moneymaker, Darbs.

769
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:45,625
Yay!

770
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:49,167
Suck on that, Taylor!

771
00:42:50,958 --> 00:42:52,042
- Yeah.
- So good.

772
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:59,042
You slayed that shit.

773
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:01,083
I'm so proud of you.
How does it feel?

774
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:10,333
I actually forgot how empowering
it feels. It's such a high.

775
00:43:10,417 --> 00:43:13,833
I feel like I have lockjaw from
forcing a smile for an hour.

776
00:43:13,917 --> 00:43:16,167
Great job
out there.

777
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:19,792
No way.

778
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,542
You... You know the donut?

779
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:25,667
Yeah, I never would've thought
cheering was your thing.

780
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,375
- You're full of surprises.
- I'm full of surprises?

781
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:32,333
You weren't kidding when you said you were
gonna find the most ridiculous activity.

782
00:43:32,417 --> 00:43:36,500
Well, it counts as a gym class credit.
I get a free dozen donuts every game.

783
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:38,917
And, come on, the
outfit is sexy as hell.

784
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,333
No, no, no, no.

785
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:43,333
You cannot be friends with the
donut. This is social suicide.

786
00:43:43,417 --> 00:43:46,167
Uh, so... Uh, update on
your stalker situation?

787
00:43:46,917 --> 00:43:49,208
- It's ongoing.
- Ooh. Sorry to hear that.

788
00:43:49,292 --> 00:43:50,833
Step away from the donut.

789
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:54,167
I'll talk to you
later. Okay, Alex?

790
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,250
Okay.

791
00:43:56,792 --> 00:44:01,458
I mean, that new cheer girl's
just sick on the mat. And cute.

792
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:05,208
She's not new. That's Darby Harper.
And she's, like, a witch or something.

793
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:07,208
Yeah. She basically
killed Capri.

794
00:44:07,292 --> 00:44:09,333
Thank you
for your patience.

795
00:44:09,417 --> 00:44:14,250
If I call out your name, welcome
to the Fighting Donuts cheer team.

796
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:15,333
You made it.

797
00:44:15,417 --> 00:44:19,125
Yes! I knew you could do it.
God, I haven't felt this alive since...

798
00:44:19,208 --> 00:44:20,833
Well, since I was alive.

799
00:44:22,167 --> 00:44:24,625
Darby Harper, is that
a smile on your face?

800
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:27,208
Congrats on making the team,
Darbs. See you on the field.

801
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:30,208
- Say thanks, weirdo.
- Thanks, weirdo, you.

802
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:35,875
- How does he know I made the team?
- Probably posted it to IG. Check.

803
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:40,833
Okay! Look at you
with 756 followers.

804
00:44:40,917 --> 00:44:43,333
Congrats, you're actually
becoming a real person.

805
00:44:43,417 --> 00:44:46,500
Now, repost it to your
story. And, um, humble brag.

806
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,333
Pretend like you
don't actually care.

807
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:49,750
Uh, I don't really care.

808
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:51,875
Perfect! God, you're
so good at that.

809
00:44:54,042 --> 00:44:55,167
<i>I actually did care.</i>

810
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:59,167
<i>I'd finally started making
it in the living world,</i>

811
00:44:59,792 --> 00:45:03,208
<i>but it turns out there are a
lot of rules to being popular.</i>

812
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:06,083
<i>Don't brag, only humble brag.</i>

813
00:45:06,167 --> 00:45:09,625
<i>It's okay to be moody, but
never sad. Sad is cringe.</i>

814
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:11,042
<i>Don't try too hard.</i>

815
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,292
<i>Be woke, but not a woke fisher.</i>

816
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:16,250
<i>Don't be thirsty. Do listen. Do
smile. Speak clearly. Don't be angry.</i>

817
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:18,833
<i>Be a winner. Don't worry. Dress
to impress. Don't overgram.</i>

818
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:21,125
<i>I prefer the Deados any day.</i>

819
00:45:21,208 --> 00:45:23,792
<i>Sure, they're dead, but at
least they don't play games.</i>

820
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:30,125
The admiration and envy
hang so heavily in the air,

821
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:32,250
even a dead girl can
smell its sweet musk.

822
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:33,958
Hey, hey, Darby!

823
00:45:34,042 --> 00:45:36,042
- Ah! Ah, ah.
- I'll check you later.

824
00:45:37,542 --> 00:45:40,917
- But I have chess with Gary.
- Mm-mmm. Not today, you don't.

825
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:45,208
Sit.

826
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:50,667
Full
set. Unbelievable.

827
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,875
Yeah. Cool.

828
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,292
Say hi. Jesus Christ, I
feel like a ventriloquist.

829
00:45:55,792 --> 00:45:56,833
Hi.

830
00:45:56,917 --> 00:45:58,833
Hey, Todd.

831
00:45:58,917 --> 00:45:59,917
Nice catch, bro.

832
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,208
Darby. You lit that
mat on fire. Seriously.

833
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:05,125
- Welcome to the team.
- Thanks.

834
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:08,458
- Hey, Darby. Looking good.
- Oh, thanks.

835
00:46:08,542 --> 00:46:10,667
Aw! Look at you all
flush with endorphins.

836
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:13,833
This is probably the first time
you've experienced popularity, huh?

837
00:46:13,917 --> 00:46:17,750
Own it, girl. Also, smile? Yeah,
you have spinach in your teeth.

838
00:46:17,833 --> 00:46:19,833
- What?
- Phase one of my plan is complete.

839
00:46:19,917 --> 00:46:22,083
You've joined the team
and gained influence.

840
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:23,167
Now on to phase two.

841
00:46:27,708 --> 00:46:28,875
That's phase two.

842
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:32,958
Oh, my God.

843
00:46:33,792 --> 00:46:36,542
I swore I had a tampon in here.

844
00:46:36,625 --> 00:46:39,583
She did. I put it in your locker.
You're welcome.

845
00:46:39,667 --> 00:46:41,875
I wore white jeans.
Do you have anything?

846
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:43,375
Still trans.

847
00:46:43,458 --> 00:46:44,917
Go on, this is your cue.

848
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,292
- Sorry, boo. I don't have any.
- Oh, my God. Come on.

849
00:46:51,625 --> 00:46:52,833
Here, Taylor.

850
00:46:56,042 --> 00:46:57,042
Thanks.

851
00:46:58,125 --> 00:47:01,083
Retreat. Retreat!
Act natural. Come on.

852
00:47:03,458 --> 00:47:04,875
Yeah.

853
00:47:07,583 --> 00:47:10,125
So, I guess we have
to practice the stunt.

854
00:47:11,167 --> 00:47:13,500
You can come over
tomorrow after school.

855
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:15,625
Yeah, sounds good.

856
00:47:18,458 --> 00:47:21,833
I will see you then. I guess.

857
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:03,958
Why the sudden desire to
join cheer, Darby Harper?

858
00:48:04,042 --> 00:48:05,208
Whoa. What's happening?

859
00:48:05,292 --> 00:48:07,643
- She thinks you're an undercover narc.
- Like <i>21 Jump Street</i>.

860
00:48:07,667 --> 00:48:09,583
- She's clean.
- Nice.

861
00:48:09,667 --> 00:48:11,708
Uh... Say something.
Um, something good.

862
00:48:12,583 --> 00:48:14,042
Well, honestly, you guys,

863
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:17,917
that recruitment skit that you guys
did in gym class really spoke to me.

864
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,583
I wrote that.

865
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:22,542
After I said, "Let's
write a script."

866
00:48:22,625 --> 00:48:26,708
And I just thought, "Wow." I
mean, "I wish I had such cool friends."

867
00:48:26,792 --> 00:48:30,042
Yeah, we're definitely an
upgrade from that weird donut kid.

868
00:48:30,125 --> 00:48:32,583
- Yeah. Are you dating the donut?
- Squash that. Now.

869
00:48:32,667 --> 00:48:34,792
No. No, I
don't really know him.

870
00:48:34,875 --> 00:48:36,792
Ooh, I wonder how
James is doing.

871
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:38,583
Bitch, I will drown
you in a toilet bowl

872
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:40,667
if you think for one
second about dating Jamesy.

873
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,542
I think he's coming
back to school soon.

874
00:48:42,625 --> 00:48:45,792
It's gonna be so sad
seeing him without Capri.

875
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:48,417
- I still can't believe that she's gone.
- Here's your in.

876
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:51,625
Um, well, isn't Capri's
birthday coming up?

877
00:48:51,708 --> 00:48:54,792
Do you guys have, I don't know,
anything special planned for it?

878
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:57,875
Well, she had this big
Coachella-themed party planned.

879
00:48:57,958 --> 00:49:00,250
- Yes, Bree. Keep going.
- It's canceled, obviously.

880
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:02,833
Well, you know, what would be so cool...

881
00:49:02,917 --> 00:49:05,042
Okay, easy.
Don't force it.

882
00:49:05,125 --> 00:49:08,167
Actually, you know what, never
mind. It's none of my business.

883
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:10,083
I wasn't friends with
her. I'm gonna go.

884
00:49:10,167 --> 00:49:12,000
Wait, wait. What
were you gonna say?

885
00:49:12,667 --> 00:49:14,833
Well,
wouldn't it be great

886
00:49:14,917 --> 00:49:16,917
if you guys did something
to celebrate her,

887
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,958
and remember all of her
amazing qualities? Like...

888
00:49:20,042 --> 00:49:21,792
Being named after pants.

889
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:24,000
Right. But, you know...

890
00:49:24,083 --> 00:49:26,750
There were so many things
about Capri, right? Like...

891
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:32,000
I mean, she was,
uh, pretty and...

892
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:35,542
Oh! Bossy. Yeah, she was bossy.

893
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:38,708
Well, anyway. Wouldn't it
be cool if you guys threw

894
00:49:38,792 --> 00:49:41,208
Capri's Sweet Seventeen
party in her honor?

895
00:49:41,292 --> 00:49:45,083
A birthday party for
our dead best friend?

896
00:49:45,167 --> 00:49:47,667
That seems
kind of inappropriate.

897
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,375
- Bad form.
- Yeah. Super weird.

898
00:49:49,458 --> 00:49:50,851
Uh, followers!
Instagram followers.

899
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:55,833
Well, what if it was to support
accidental electrocution awareness?

900
00:49:55,917 --> 00:49:57,167
- What?
- Huh?

901
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:00,542
I mean, I'm sure it'd make the
news and draw national attention.

902
00:50:00,625 --> 00:50:01,750
Genius.

903
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:04,042
"Hashtag Capri's
Sweet Seventeen."

904
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:08,583
A celebration of her life, thrown
by her three best friends.

905
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:10,833
Yeah, this could make you
guys legit influencers.

906
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,583
Influencers for accidental
electrocution awareness, of course.

907
00:50:14,667 --> 00:50:16,833
- Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
- Electrical.

908
00:50:16,917 --> 00:50:18,833
Yes!

909
00:50:18,917 --> 00:50:21,083
- Oh, I... Hi. Sorry.
- Uh. Hi. Hi.

910
00:50:21,167 --> 00:50:22,833
Jelly legs. Eat a banana.

911
00:50:22,917 --> 00:50:24,500
- I'm gonna stretch.
- Bye.

912
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:25,583
Oops.

913
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,500
We did it.

914
00:50:32,583 --> 00:50:38,042
Ugh. Honestly, I think the party will
be even more iconic now that I'm dead.

915
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:40,583
Ooh, you know, we should
do something special

916
00:50:40,667 --> 00:50:42,292
at midnight to symbolize
you passing on.

917
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:45,042
Ooh! Like, uh, releasing
a white dove or something?

918
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,417
- Oh.
- That's fresh.

919
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,208
Yeah, that's cool. I actually
haven't done that for anyone yet.

920
00:50:50,583 --> 00:50:51,583
You know,

921
00:50:51,667 --> 00:50:53,583
I used to think you were
such a stuck-up bitch,

922
00:50:53,667 --> 00:50:55,292
but you're actually kinda cool.

923
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,042
You thought I was
a stuck-up bitch?

924
00:50:58,125 --> 00:50:59,333
Oh, please.

925
00:50:59,417 --> 00:51:01,875
You acted like you
were so edgy and cool,

926
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:05,250
and everyone else was basic
and below you or something.

927
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:06,417
What?

928
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:09,060
Of course, that was before I knew
you were dealing with all this…

929
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:10,708
dead people shit.

930
00:51:12,708 --> 00:51:14,333
Must be very isolating for you.

931
00:51:15,708 --> 00:51:20,875
Capri Donahue, did you just
express empathy for another person?

932
00:51:21,542 --> 00:51:25,333
Well, I didn't really
think about it before I died

933
00:51:25,417 --> 00:51:28,375
but being popular
can be isolating too.

934
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:30,917
Isn't that an oxymoron?

935
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
No.

936
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,500
Imagine everyone has these
high expectations of you,

937
00:51:37,583 --> 00:51:39,250
and you don't wanna
disappoint them,

938
00:51:39,333 --> 00:51:42,250
so you just keep all your
imperfections bottled up inside.

939
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:44,208
You have imperfections?

940
00:51:44,292 --> 00:51:46,792
Well, not my looks or
personality in general, but…

941
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:51,417
my mom used to say that I wasn't smart
and that I'd only get by on my looks.

942
00:51:54,542 --> 00:51:56,750
I've never
told anyone that.

943
00:51:57,875 --> 00:52:00,333
Capri, I think you're smart.

944
00:52:00,958 --> 00:52:02,917
Like, maybe even dangerously so.

945
00:52:05,625 --> 00:52:07,042
Thanks.

946
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:09,625
I just don't think your looks
are anything to write home about.

947
00:52:13,125 --> 00:52:14,765
How are the numbers
on the bikini selfie?

948
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:17,292
Did you Photoshop this?

949
00:52:17,375 --> 00:52:19,250
- No.
- I can teach you how to Facetune.

950
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:20,613
- Okay. It's fine.
- Why?

951
00:52:21,333 --> 00:52:23,042
Ooh! "Slay, Queen!

952
00:52:23,125 --> 00:52:27,083
You are the hottest girl to
ever walk the halls of FDHS."

953
00:52:35,292 --> 00:52:36,692
Whoo!

954
00:52:38,042 --> 00:52:40,167
Let's go
Cougars! Let's go, ladies!

955
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:42,417
- Let's go! Come on!
- Yeah!

956
00:52:43,292 --> 00:52:45,375
Whoo!

957
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:14,417
Whoo!

958
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,667
Yeah!

959
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,083
Darby! Darby!
Darby! Darby! Darby!

960
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:34,000
Yo!

961
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:35,500
Whoo!

962
00:53:46,583 --> 00:53:50,500
I am accepted, admired,
maybe even adored.

963
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,160
People who couldn't pick me
out of a lineup a month ago

964
00:53:53,208 --> 00:53:54,792
now comment with things like...

965
00:53:54,875 --> 00:53:56,875
Fire emoji, fire emoji.

966
00:53:56,958 --> 00:53:58,167
Crown emoji.

967
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:59,458
And...

968
00:53:59,542 --> 00:54:02,458
Dying! Heart eye emoji.

969
00:54:02,542 --> 00:54:03,583
And even...

970
00:54:03,667 --> 00:54:06,625
- Eggplant emoji.
- Water spray emoji.

971
00:54:07,458 --> 00:54:08,583
Any press is good press.

972
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:13,833
Every like, every comment, every
regram is a rush of dopamine.

973
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:16,250
I feel a certain sense of power.

974
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:19,500
And on game nights,
I feel extra alive.

975
00:54:19,583 --> 00:54:24,833
Ladies and gentlemen!

976
00:54:24,917 --> 00:54:30,167
It's time to make the donut!

977
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:33,000
Donut! Donut! Donut!

978
00:54:33,083 --> 00:54:34,875
Here we go! Here we go!

979
00:54:41,042 --> 00:54:43,833
Go, Darby! Go,
Darby! Go, Darby! Go, Darby!

980
00:55:01,417 --> 00:55:02,583
Here we go!

981
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:13,708
Wait, no!

982
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:18,958
- Dude.
- Hello.

983
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,542
- You got some moves, huh?
- Yeah, I do.

984
00:55:23,792 --> 00:55:25,583
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

985
00:55:27,292 --> 00:55:29,583
Oh, my God. I haven't
laughed this hard in li...

986
00:55:30,417 --> 00:55:33,375
I've never laughed this hard.
My cheeks hurt.

987
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:34,833
Wait, wait, your cheeks hurt?

988
00:55:34,917 --> 00:55:37,125
At least the padded icing
cushioned your fall.

989
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,750
Okay.

990
00:55:43,458 --> 00:55:46,333
Look, Darby, there's something
I really wanted to tell you.

991
00:55:46,417 --> 00:55:48,417
Hey, Darby. You
coming to the lake?

992
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,250
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, awesome.

993
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:51,833
Awesome.

994
00:55:52,333 --> 00:55:53,958
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

995
00:55:54,042 --> 00:55:56,083
I'm dying to go take this
stupid thing off anyway.

996
00:55:56,167 --> 00:56:00,417
But, uh, maybe we could
go get a coffee next week?

997
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,542
How about Thursday,
right after school?

998
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:05,167
Go to Indie Roasters? It's downtown.

999
00:56:06,417 --> 00:56:08,500
- I'll be there.
- Okay.

1000
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:10,333
Cool, cool. Very cool.

1001
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:14,434
Okay, let's
take another one.

1002
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:16,184
- Okay, ready? Smile.
- Let's go.

1003
00:56:16,208 --> 00:56:19,625
You know you don't have to talk to
the mascot after the game ends, right?

1004
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:22,583
Oh, yeah. He was just seeing if I
wanted to grab a coffee next week.

1005
00:56:22,667 --> 00:56:23,917
Could you imagine?

1006
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,917
Douglas The Donut
takes you to Starbucks.

1007
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,167
What a scandal.

1008
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:30,333
Oh, my God!

1009
00:56:30,417 --> 00:56:32,375
My uncle said we can use
his house for the party.

1010
00:56:32,458 --> 00:56:33,559
- No way.
- Oh, my God.

1011
00:56:33,583 --> 00:56:35,750
You know that giant
glass house on the lake?

1012
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:37,113
Wait, that's your uncle's house?

1013
00:56:37,167 --> 00:56:40,083
Yeah. Her uncle invented that
crypto banking app, Money Grab.

1014
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:42,792
It's an app
that's like a bank

1015
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:46,292
but instead of going to an actual bank,
you go to the app and like grab money.

1016
00:56:46,375 --> 00:56:48,167
No, Bree, it's an actual bank.

1017
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:50,042
It's just, like, the
money that isn't real.

1018
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:52,208
Anyway, it'll be
sick for the party.

1019
00:56:52,292 --> 00:56:53,542
Tell 'em how big it is.

1020
00:56:53,625 --> 00:56:56,292
The chandelier has a chandelier.

1021
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:57,833
- Yeah.
- Guys, let's go to the lake.

1022
00:56:57,917 --> 00:57:00,542
Let's pop some
tops, okay? Right?

1023
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:03,917
Oh, Darby can't hang out
on Friday nights, remember?

1024
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,250
- Her daddy wants her home early.
- Yeah.

1025
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:08,518
But the head of the
homecoming committee will be there.

1026
00:57:08,542 --> 00:57:10,292
We can kiss her ass
for a queen nomination.

1027
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:11,375
It's gonna suck.

1028
00:57:11,917 --> 00:57:13,458
- You should come.
- Uh...

1029
00:57:13,542 --> 00:57:15,042
Don't you have work tonight?

1030
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:16,375
Isn't that your whole thing?

1031
00:57:16,458 --> 00:57:17,792
- Please?
- Come on, Harper.

1032
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:19,208
Break the rules.

1033
00:57:19,292 --> 00:57:20,851
- Come on, Harper.
- Do it.

1034
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:22,915
- It'll be fun.
- Okay. Just give me a sec.

1035
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:24,838
- I'm gonna call my dad, okay?
- Awesome.

1036
00:57:24,917 --> 00:57:26,917
- Whoo-hoo! Nice.
- Gotta get permission.

1037
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,667
- Ooh!
- Okay.

1038
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:30,917
Hey, can you please tell
the Deados something came up

1039
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,917
- and I can't make it tonight?
- What?

1040
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,920
You're really gonna blow off the Deados
just so you can drink hard seltzer

1041
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,708
that literally tastes like
Strawberry Shortcake's butt crack?

1042
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:40,167
Come on. Please?

1043
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:44,167
I have literally never taken
a Friday off work before.

1044
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:45,625
We just won the game.

1045
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:47,708
I don't feel like hanging
with dead people tonight.

1046
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:49,333
No offense.

1047
00:57:49,417 --> 00:57:52,042
Okay, well, I don't feel like
hanging out with dead people either.

1048
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:53,500
Then come with us.

1049
00:57:55,375 --> 00:57:57,175
So I can hide in the
bushes like Michael Myers

1050
00:57:57,208 --> 00:57:59,128
and watch you guys have fun?

1051
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:00,708
No, thank you.

1052
00:58:00,792 --> 00:58:02,184
- Come on, Harper!
- Come on!

1053
00:58:02,208 --> 00:58:03,208
Coming!

1054
00:58:03,292 --> 00:58:06,292
Did you hear that they're using
Taylor's uncle's mansion for the party?

1055
00:58:06,375 --> 00:58:07,500
Great news, right?

1056
00:58:08,167 --> 00:58:09,542
Yay.

1057
00:58:09,625 --> 00:58:10,833
There you are!

1058
00:58:10,917 --> 00:58:12,500
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Let's go.

1059
00:58:12,583 --> 00:58:14,543
- Party time! All right.
- Let's go!

1060
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:17,833
I'll go back to being a
mole person after the party

1061
00:58:17,917 --> 00:58:22,625
but until then, fooling all the normies
is actually kind of satisfying.

1062
00:58:25,042 --> 00:58:28,000
Shoulders back, head up.

1063
00:58:28,542 --> 00:58:32,292
Although, I won't deny the influencing
has become slightly intoxicating.

1064
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:35,667
I mean, I had single-handedly
started a fashion trend.

1065
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:44,417
Me. The invisible girl.

1066
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,583
The girl no one even
realized existed.

1067
00:58:53,542 --> 00:58:54,542
Hey, Darbs.

1068
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:56,375
Are you stoked for
the game on Friday?

1069
00:58:56,458 --> 00:58:57,458
"Darbs"?

1070
00:58:57,542 --> 00:59:00,292
I'll be more stoked if you guys
can score a touchdown this time.

1071
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:01,833
Oh, oh.

1072
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:11,000
Okay, the tent is
arriving Saturday morning.

1073
00:59:11,083 --> 00:59:14,000
DJ Linky Dinky Dog will create a
collaborative playlist on Spotify

1074
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:15,625
so we can all add
our favorite songs.

1075
00:59:16,208 --> 00:59:19,250
- Uh, Capri's favorite songs.
- Got it.

1076
00:59:19,333 --> 00:59:23,167
Uh, Todd is bringing the kegs,
and where are we on the dove?

1077
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:25,583
Oh, my mom ordered
us one on Amazon.

1078
00:59:25,667 --> 00:59:28,333
She cried when I told her your
plan to release it at midnight.

1079
00:59:28,417 --> 00:59:31,083
Mmm, it's so poetic.
Genius really.

1080
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:32,500
Well,

1081
00:59:32,583 --> 00:59:34,250
I feel like I can't
take credit for that.

1082
00:59:34,333 --> 00:59:36,333
I think it's something
Capri would've come up with.

1083
00:59:36,417 --> 00:59:39,375
Uh, no. She
really wasn't that deep.

1084
00:59:39,458 --> 00:59:40,917
- What the f...
- Oh, look...

1085
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,875
Look the... the editor sent
me the final cut of the promo.

1086
00:59:43,958 --> 00:59:45,918
- Ooh.
- I'm gonna post it tonight.

1087
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:50,208
<i>This Saturday, Capri
Donahue's Coachella-themed R.I.P.</i>

1088
00:59:50,292 --> 00:59:52,042
<i>Rest In Party.</i>

1089
00:59:53,042 --> 00:59:56,125
<i>A party so epic they'll
hear it in the afterlife.</i>

1092

<i>Party on.</i>

1093
01:00:04,875 --> 01:00:06,292
Iconic.

1094
01:00:06,375 --> 01:00:07,625
Well, I have chills.

1095
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:11,083
It's literally the best memorial
party promo I have ever seen.

1096
01:00:11,167 --> 01:00:12,208
Right?

1097
01:00:12,292 --> 01:00:13,292
Oh, my God.

1098
01:00:13,792 --> 01:00:14,958
- Oh, my God!
- What? What?

1099
01:00:15,042 --> 01:00:17,583
They just posted homecoming
queen nominations.

1100
01:00:17,667 --> 01:00:19,417
Congrats, girl!

1101
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,820
What?

1102
01:00:20,875 --> 01:00:23,559
- Uh, no, no, no. That can't be right.
- Oh, my God. You'll totally win.

1103
01:00:23,583 --> 01:00:26,018
Especially because your party is
gonna be the coolest of all time.

1104
01:00:26,042 --> 01:00:28,292
Oh, is it your party now? Is
that what we're calling it?

1105
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,458
My party? No,
guys, it's not my party.

1106
01:00:30,542 --> 01:00:31,542
It's Capri's party.

1107
01:00:31,625 --> 01:00:34,375
- Totally. Of course.
- Yeah, right.

1108
01:00:34,458 --> 01:00:35,458
Not really.

1109
01:00:36,417 --> 01:00:39,500
But I mean, it's kind
of become your party.

1110
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,125
It was your idea, and you
planned the whole thing.

1111
01:00:42,208 --> 01:00:44,000
No. My idea, Taylor.

1112
01:00:44,083 --> 01:00:46,125
- I planned the whole thing!
- Shh!

1113
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:49,958
Sure, sure. But it's
all for Capri, remember?

1114
01:00:50,042 --> 01:00:52,833
Just tell them I'm here. I'm
so sick of being invisible!

1115
01:00:55,292 --> 01:00:57,000
- Uh...
- Um, ow.

1116
01:00:57,083 --> 01:00:58,083
- It was a bee.
- Really?

1117
01:00:58,167 --> 01:00:59,684
- It was a bee.
- Did you just do that?

1118
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:00,851
- Yeah.
- You wanna go?

1119
01:01:00,875 --> 01:01:02,625
No, I got it.
It was buzzing around.

1120
01:01:02,708 --> 01:01:03,833
Okay.

1121
01:01:03,917 --> 01:01:06,333
You guys should go to the
locker room. I'm gonna warm up.

1122
01:01:06,417 --> 01:01:08,833
Warm up? We just
finished practice.

1123
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:12,250
You don't make it to Nationals
by losing all your warmth, Bree.

1124
01:01:12,917 --> 01:01:13,917
You're weird.

1125
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:16,292
- But so right.
- Yeah, I am right.

1126
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:17,375
Whatever. Okay. Bye.

1127
01:01:17,458 --> 01:01:19,167
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

1128
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:20,250
Bye.

1129
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:22,417
- You're my hero.
- Oh.

1130
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,292
Are you trying
to blow my cover?

1131
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:30,167
This party's supposed
to be my moment.

1132
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:31,930
You've hijacked it!
It's all about you now!

1133
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
What? No, it's not.

1134
01:01:33,083 --> 01:01:35,208
Capri, there's literally
gonna be a 40-foot projection

1135
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:37,000
of your face in the night sky.

1136
01:01:37,083 --> 01:01:38,167
Like a friggin' Bat-Signal.

1137
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:41,417
Yeah, which the homecoming committee
will probably give you credit for.

1138
01:01:41,917 --> 01:01:44,625
I'm not really gonna be homecoming
queen. It's probably just a joke,

1139
01:01:44,708 --> 01:01:46,917
and they're gonna pour pig's
blood on me or something.

1140
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,417
Ew.

1141
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:51,125
Look, I know it sucks
for you not to be here

1142
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:52,928
but there's really no
need to be jealous...

1143
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:55,417
No, I'm not jealous.
Don't flatter yourself.

1144
01:01:56,292 --> 01:01:57,917
I'm sleeping at my
house this week.

1145
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,917
Good luck picking out a homecoming
dress without me to do it for you.

1146
01:02:07,208 --> 01:02:08,208
What is it, Gary?

1147
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:09,708
It's my buddy, Mel.

1148
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:11,833
He came to see you Friday
night, you weren't there,

1149
01:02:11,917 --> 01:02:13,792
and he's... he's in
a bad way, Darby.

1150
01:02:13,875 --> 01:02:16,750
You know. He says he doesn't
feel right. It's unnatural.

1151
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:18,875
He's really ready to move on.

1152
01:02:18,958 --> 01:02:22,167
Okay, well, I'm not the border
patrol for the afterlife.

1153
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:23,250
He can go on his own.

1154
01:02:23,333 --> 01:02:24,667
'Course he can, but-but...

1155
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:27,375
See, he needs you to get a...
A message to his kid first.

1156
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:30,458
He wants to tell him that he's
sorry he didn't accept him as a gay.

1157
01:02:30,542 --> 01:02:32,125
He's not a gay. He's gay.

1158
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:33,583
Yes, my son, Allen. He's gay.

1159
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:35,458
And I love him anyway
and his husband,

1160
01:02:35,542 --> 01:02:37,583
and I think they're
gonna be great parents.

1161
01:02:37,667 --> 01:02:38,667
Like he said.

1162
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:43,792
Gosh, I'm sorry I
wasn't there, Mel.

1163
01:02:43,875 --> 01:02:45,515
- Great practice, Darbs.
- Yeah,

1164
01:02:45,583 --> 01:02:46,875
you too, dude.

1165
01:02:48,083 --> 01:02:49,083
Look.

1166
01:02:49,167 --> 01:02:52,042
Come see me Friday night. I'll
be there. I'll help you, okay?

1167
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:53,458
- Okay.
- Promise.

1168
01:02:53,542 --> 01:02:55,062
- Thank you, Darby.
- Thank you, Darby.

1169
01:03:00,958 --> 01:03:02,417
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

1170
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:05,917
- Take it you're not staying for dinner?
- Uh, no. I gotta go to James's.

1171
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,083
Oh.

1172
01:03:07,167 --> 01:03:10,833
Honey, listen, I am glad that
you're making friends this year.

1173
01:03:10,917 --> 01:03:12,208
But is everything okay?

1174
01:03:12,875 --> 01:03:17,000
I mean… …you just don't
seem like yourself anymore.

1175
01:03:17,083 --> 01:03:19,708
God, Dad. I mean, you pressure
me to get a social life,

1176
01:03:19,792 --> 01:03:21,958
and then you give me
crap when I have one?

1177
01:03:22,042 --> 01:03:23,458
- Make up your mind.
- Okay.

1178
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:25,583
That's valid.

1179
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:28,167
But, honey, I'm just
checking in on you.

1180
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:30,583
Well, you don't have to
worry about me, 'kay?

1181
01:03:30,667 --> 01:03:32,083
I'm fine, really.

1182
01:03:32,167 --> 01:03:33,667
Same old Darby.

1183
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:38,917
Oh, and can I get a studio
lighting kit for my birthday?

1184
01:03:39,417 --> 01:03:42,292
The lamps in my room are a little,
like, warm and cozy. It's gross.

1185
01:03:42,375 --> 01:03:43,958
- Mmm.
- You know?

1186
01:03:44,042 --> 01:03:45,708
Anyway, bye.

1187
01:03:45,792 --> 01:03:46,917
Bye.

1188
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:49,833
Yep, same old Darby.

1189
01:03:58,583 --> 01:04:01,583
Did you know that octopus
have three brains?

1190
01:04:01,667 --> 01:04:03,875
Um, wrong.

1191
01:04:03,958 --> 01:04:05,798
- What do you mean?
- I'm not... I mean, wrong!

1192
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:07,167
They have nine brains.

1193
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:09,333
Come on, man. The
test is next week.

1194
01:04:09,417 --> 01:04:11,042
Oh.

1195
01:04:11,125 --> 01:04:13,250
Hey, uh, look what I
found the other day.

1196
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:14,333
Mmm?

1197
01:04:15,792 --> 01:04:17,750
Look at this. Our, uh…

1198
01:04:17,833 --> 01:04:19,958
…sixth-grade field trip
to the planetarium.

1199
01:04:20,042 --> 01:04:21,375
Oh, wow.

1200
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,208
Harper and Harris.

1201
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:25,292
I
thought you were so cool.

1202
01:04:25,375 --> 01:04:27,750
What? Seriously?

1203
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:30,375
Yeah, you were so different
from everyone else.

1204
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:39,125
It's going to be so weird to go
back to school without Capri tomorrow.

1205
01:04:42,167 --> 01:04:45,042
Did you hear about that idiotic
Sweet Seventeen party for her?

1206
01:04:45,125 --> 01:04:49,375
Uh, yeah, yeah. Think I heard
someone talking about that.

1207
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:52,583
Good to know Taylor, Bree and Piper
are so desperate for attention

1208
01:04:52,667 --> 01:04:55,375
that they're willing to whore
out Capri's memory to get it.

1209
01:04:57,042 --> 01:04:59,000
But isn't it for a good cause?

1210
01:04:59,083 --> 01:05:00,833
Accidental
electrocution awareness?

1211
01:05:01,667 --> 01:05:03,268
Which one of those
morons came up with that?

1212
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:07,625
- Oh, c-cool tree house.
- Yeah.

1213
01:05:08,125 --> 01:05:09,333
Wanna come check it out?

1214
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:14,750
Whoa.

1215
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:17,833
I haven't been up here since…

1216
01:05:24,042 --> 01:05:27,542
I didn't wanna leave my
room for months after my mom died.

1217
01:05:28,667 --> 01:05:29,667
I just…

1218
01:05:30,167 --> 01:05:33,667
I felt like if I just
returned to regular life

1219
01:05:34,667 --> 01:05:36,917
and ignored the fact that
she wasn't there anymore,

1220
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,208
it'd be like living
a lie or something.

1221
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,125
But it does get easier. It does.

1222
01:05:44,625 --> 01:05:46,417
And I know you can do this.

1223
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:47,500
Thanks.

1224
01:05:48,792 --> 01:05:49,792
You really get it.

1225
01:05:53,042 --> 01:05:54,750
Why's he looking
at me like that?

1226
01:05:54,833 --> 01:05:56,208
What's going on?

1227
01:05:59,833 --> 01:06:02,042
Darby, will you come to
school with me tomorrow?

1228
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:05,333
U-Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'll be there.

1229
01:06:05,417 --> 01:06:08,958
No, I... I mean, can
I... can I pick you up?

1230
01:06:09,667 --> 01:06:11,875
It's gonna be tough for me
to face without Capri there

1231
01:06:11,958 --> 01:06:14,583
and, you know, I could really
use someone by my side.

1232
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:20,917
Sure, sure. I don't
see why not.

1233
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,333
Thanks, Darby.

1234
01:06:23,792 --> 01:06:25,250
Oh.

1235
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:29,083
Your hair
smells so good.

1236
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:32,042
Thanks, it's
shampoo. I gotta go.

1237
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:33,125
It's getting late.

1238
01:06:33,208 --> 01:06:34,208
- All right.
- Yeah.

1239
01:06:34,292 --> 01:06:35,667
- See you tomorrow?
- Sure.

1240
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:38,083
- Be careful on the way down.
- I'll just leap down.

1241
01:06:38,167 --> 01:06:39,500
- Need help?
- No, I got it.

1242
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,125
It's just some environmentally
conscious carpooling.

1243
01:06:48,292 --> 01:06:51,958
You know, Capri will probably thank
me for being there to support him.

1244
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:54,833
<i>I will drown
you in a toilet bowl</i>

1245
01:06:54,917 --> 01:06:57,000
<i>if you think for one
second about dating Jamesy.</i>

1246
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:02,875
Gonna introduce
me to your boyfriend?

1247
01:07:02,958 --> 01:07:04,208
What? Who told you that?

1248
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:08,000
No, no. That's just
my biology partner.

1249
01:07:08,083 --> 01:07:12,083
Okay. Well, boyfriend, biology
partner, whatever you kids call it.

1250
01:07:18,917 --> 01:07:20,333
Time to face the music.

1251
01:07:21,667 --> 01:07:23,292
Okay, well, see you in bio.

1252
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:25,125
Hang on. Will you walk with me?

1253
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:27,333
Oh, no.

1254
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:28,833
Sure, James.

1255
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:37,542
- Oh, ho ho!
- James Harris is back.

1256
01:07:37,625 --> 01:07:39,833
How'd Darby Harper
manage to pull him

1257
01:07:39,917 --> 01:07:41,958
before the bell even rang
on his first day back?

1258
01:07:42,042 --> 01:07:43,958
Are they,
like, together now?

1259
01:07:44,042 --> 01:07:45,042
James.

1260
01:07:46,417 --> 01:07:48,833
Well, that's gotta be
the world's fastest rebound.

1261
01:07:48,917 --> 01:07:51,667
James.
Welcome back, brother.

1262
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:56,542
Nothing to see here, folks.
Just me and James Harris.

1263
01:07:57,208 --> 01:07:58,917
Just me and the boy
Blake Shelton called,

1264
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,250
"A talented guy I should
have turned my chair for."

1265
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:04,458
Who, I guess, has a crush on
me now?

1266
01:08:04,542 --> 01:08:06,792
Nothing out of the ordinary
going on here.

1267
01:08:11,792 --> 01:08:13,417
They're
holding hands.

1268
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,380
Capri Donahue's gonna
drown me in a toilet bowl.

1269
01:08:15,417 --> 01:08:16,542
What?

1270
01:08:17,292 --> 01:08:19,250
So, are you and James,
like, a thing now?

1271
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:22,292
'Cause everyone is saying that you
made out in the hallway this morning.

1272
01:08:22,375 --> 01:08:23,875
No. No, we didn't.

1273
01:08:23,958 --> 01:08:26,250
His hand just brushed
mine for a few seconds.

1274
01:08:26,333 --> 01:08:28,292
He's having a hard time
being back without Capri.

1275
01:08:28,375 --> 01:08:30,708
Oh, yes, poor James.
The wounded bird.

1276
01:08:30,792 --> 01:08:32,542
Yeah, I would be careful.

1277
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:35,250
He's so codependent and
definitely on the rebound.

1278
01:08:35,333 --> 01:08:36,958
And morally, it's gross.

1279
01:08:37,042 --> 01:08:39,708
Totally. Capri's not even
cold in her grave yet.

1280
01:08:39,792 --> 01:08:42,208
You guys, it was just a
one-time ride to school.

1281
01:08:42,292 --> 01:08:43,833
Darby.

1282
01:08:43,917 --> 01:08:45,583
You, uh... You want a ride home?

1283
01:08:45,667 --> 01:08:47,542
No! No, thanks.

1284
01:08:47,625 --> 01:08:51,083
I'm just gonna get my cardio
in, you know?

1285
01:08:51,167 --> 01:08:52,458
All right, well, come by later.

1286
01:08:53,083 --> 01:08:54,083
Wrote a song for you.

1287
01:08:54,792 --> 01:08:56,625
- There's a song.
- Oh, my God.

1288
01:08:56,708 --> 01:08:58,375
Gotta run. You know?

1289
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:01,000
She's running in that?

1290
01:09:01,083 --> 01:09:02,417
She doesn't live close.

1291
01:09:03,458 --> 01:09:04,625
It's Thursday.

1292
01:09:05,125 --> 01:09:06,917
Only two more days
till the party.

1293
01:09:10,375 --> 01:09:12,083
I can lay low until…

1294
01:09:12,875 --> 01:09:15,458
Shit, it's Thursday.

1295
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,708
I mean, I used to have
crates of 12-inch vinyl in my den.

1296
01:09:46,792 --> 01:09:50,167
And you could read the liner notes, you
could touch 'em, you could feel 'em.

1297
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:51,875
But…
…the music cloud.

1298
01:09:52,375 --> 01:09:53,792
- Where is it? I don't get it.
- Ha!

1299
01:09:53,875 --> 01:09:56,167
Oh, my God! Can you guys stop?

1300
01:09:56,667 --> 01:09:58,667
I cannot believe I'm
spending my junior year

1301
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:00,875
listening to some dead boomers

1302
01:10:00,958 --> 01:10:06,042
talking about newspapers and
typewriters and network television.

1303
01:10:06,125 --> 01:10:08,333
Then why don't you just
make up with Darby then?

1304
01:10:09,583 --> 01:10:11,083
I mean, so what?

1305
01:10:11,167 --> 01:10:13,417
She's the Homeroom Queen
and you're not. Big deal.

1306
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,000
That's, uh, Homecoming Queen.

1307
01:10:15,083 --> 01:10:17,083
- Thank you.
- Listen, Capri,

1308
01:10:17,167 --> 01:10:18,917
you should be very
proud of yourself.

1309
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,958
You were able to pry Darby out of
her shell when no one else could.

1310
01:10:23,042 --> 01:10:26,125
Yeah, well, now she's taking the
attention and credit for my party!

1311
01:10:26,208 --> 01:10:27,208
Yeah.

1312
01:10:27,708 --> 01:10:30,500
My sister-in-law, Rose,
sang at my funeral.

1313
01:10:30,583 --> 01:10:33,417
All anybody could talk about
was how great Rose sounded.

1314
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,083
What a great voice Rose had.

1315
01:10:35,167 --> 01:10:37,667
At my funeral! And you know
what they said about me?

1316
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:38,958
"He's looked better."

1317
01:10:39,042 --> 01:10:41,583
- The audacity!
- Guys, guys, guys.

1318
01:10:41,667 --> 01:10:43,167
Who cares?

1319
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:44,458
You're dead.

1320
01:10:45,583 --> 01:10:47,458
You're throwing a temper tantrum

1321
01:10:47,542 --> 01:10:50,958
about a party in a dimension
that you no longer exist in.

1322
01:10:51,458 --> 01:10:53,042
Do you know how crazy that is?

1323
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:54,750
Well, then what's the point?

1324
01:10:55,917 --> 01:10:57,333
What's my purpose?

1325
01:10:57,417 --> 01:11:00,333
Well, you're gonna find
that out on the other side.

1326
01:11:01,083 --> 01:11:03,708
I mean, listen, I have a reason
to stick around, you know?

1327
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:05,250
I wanna be with Linda.

1328
01:11:05,333 --> 01:11:08,042
But you, you're so
young and whip-smart.

1329
01:11:08,125 --> 01:11:09,765
You got your whole
death in front of you.

1330
01:11:09,792 --> 01:11:12,417
Why would you wanna stay
here and be invisible?

1331
01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:16,000
You just have to get
the heck out of here.

1332
01:11:19,583 --> 01:11:20,583
Thanks, Gary.

1333
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:22,250
Okay.

1334
01:11:24,208 --> 01:11:26,125
She has a lot of electricity.

1335
01:11:26,208 --> 01:11:28,417
You know
that's how she died, right?

1336
01:11:29,708 --> 01:11:31,333
Hey, Alex.

1337
01:11:31,417 --> 01:11:33,917
Look, I'm so sorry
about missing our coffee date.

1338
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,083
It's okay.

1339
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:36,417
Uh, you're busy.

1340
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:38,833
I hear you're dating
James Harris now.

1341
01:11:38,917 --> 01:11:41,417
Oh, no. No, I'm
not dating James.

1342
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,000
You could have just texted me.

1343
01:11:43,083 --> 01:11:45,000
I was waiting like 20 minutes.

1344
01:11:46,292 --> 01:11:48,132
Uh, look, I gotta
go but I really do...

1345
01:11:48,208 --> 01:11:49,542
Talk to you later. Right.

1346
01:11:54,542 --> 01:11:57,125
Hey, Capri.
H-How was your Dad's?

1347
01:11:57,208 --> 01:11:58,208
Not great.

1348
01:11:58,292 --> 01:12:01,125
My mom turned my bedroom into
her personal yoga studio.

1349
01:12:01,625 --> 01:12:02,684
- Mmm.
- So...

1350
01:12:02,708 --> 01:12:04,917
Okay, well, I-I kind
of wanna talk to you.

1351
01:12:05,583 --> 01:12:06,583
Yeah, sure.

1352
01:12:07,958 --> 01:12:09,434
Okay, I'm glad you're here.

1353
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:11,583
- There's something I need to tell you.
- Me too.

1354
01:12:11,667 --> 01:12:14,333
I wanted to apologize about
overreacting about the party.

1355
01:12:14,833 --> 01:12:18,542
I've decided that I am proud of
your... Our Homecoming nomination.

1356
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:19,750
I just had to remind myself

1357
01:12:19,833 --> 01:12:21,953
that I'm the Michelangelo
behind your David, you know?

1358
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,875
Great. Well, I have
something to tell you,

1359
01:12:23,958 --> 01:12:26,458
but before you freak out, I
want you to let me explain.

1360
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:28,833
- It's about me and...
- Good to have you back.

1361
01:12:28,917 --> 01:12:31,042
James. Oh,
he's at school today.

1362
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:32,925
Look at him, he's so
cute. Look, he's glowing.

1363
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,417
Okay,
Capri. Listen to me, okay?

1364
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:37,833
There's been a misunderstanding.
You'll think it's funny...

1365
01:12:37,917 --> 01:12:40,292
There you are.

1366
01:12:40,375 --> 01:12:42,518
I've been looking all over for you.

1367
01:12:42,542 --> 01:12:43,958
This too much?

1368
01:12:44,042 --> 01:12:45,833
What the hell is going on?

1369
01:12:45,917 --> 01:12:47,792
Uh, okay. How
am I gonna do this?

1370
01:12:47,875 --> 01:12:48,958
All right, James.

1371
01:12:49,042 --> 01:12:52,333
I-I can't stop thinking about you
since the other night at my place.

1372
01:12:52,417 --> 01:12:54,625
- Did you hook up with James?
- No.

1373
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:58,000
I know we both felt something, and
yesterday when you held my hand...

1374
01:12:58,083 --> 01:12:59,458
- You what?
- No, no.

1375
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:01,958
No, I didn't hold your
hand, you held mine.

1376
01:13:02,042 --> 01:13:03,708
You slut!

1377
01:13:03,792 --> 01:13:06,875
I felt this spark and...

1378
01:13:09,583 --> 01:13:11,833
- Just really ti... I'm exhausted. Yeah.
- Are you okay?

1379
01:13:11,917 --> 01:13:12,917
Whoo!

1380
01:13:13,458 --> 01:13:16,042
I know I'm still grieving
Capri. But it just...

1381
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:17,768
- It just felt good to finally feel…
- Stop.

1382
01:13:17,792 --> 01:13:21,083
…a moment of happiness again,
and it's been so long, and I...

1383
01:13:21,667 --> 01:13:24,042
I think she'd want that.

1384
01:13:24,542 --> 01:13:26,417
No, I really don't
think she would.

1385
01:13:27,917 --> 01:13:29,917
Uh, sorry, James.

1386
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,792
I gotta get to class.
Have a good day.

1387
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:38,083
Oh, my God. How many times
do I have to tell you?

1388
01:13:38,167 --> 01:13:39,500
Nothing happened.

1389
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,750
You won't admit it.

1390
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,167
- Not even now.
- Admit what?

1391
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:45,125
Admit that you love my life so
much that you want to be me.

1392
01:13:45,208 --> 01:13:46,750
I am nothing like you, okay?

1393
01:13:46,833 --> 01:13:48,513
You don't have to worry
about me and James.

1394
01:13:48,542 --> 01:13:51,458
Oh, my God. What is this?
<i>The Young and the Restless</i>?

1395
01:13:52,417 --> 01:13:53,708
I'm outta here.

1396
01:13:53,792 --> 01:13:56,667
I'm not worried about
James. He's just trauma-bonding.

1397
01:13:56,750 --> 01:14:01,167
You don't think in a million years
he would actually like you, do you?

1398
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:03,542
Well, that's
a little harsh.

1399
01:14:03,625 --> 01:14:05,375
You're not even a real person!

1400
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:07,667
I created you! I made you!

1401
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:11,042
I dressed you up and told you how
to act so you could be popular.

1402
01:14:11,125 --> 01:14:12,208
But deep down,

1403
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:16,250
you know you're just a
freak that sees dead people.

1404
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:20,042
Maybe that's why your mom
didn't wanna come and see you.

1405
01:14:22,417 --> 01:14:25,208
Hey, ladies. It's
my big bon voyage.

1406
01:14:25,292 --> 01:14:27,917
E-Everybody out! All of you!

1407
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,042
Not optimum.

1408
01:14:32,792 --> 01:14:36,250
It's not my fault your boyfriend
finds me a refreshing change of pace

1409
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:40,875
from a talking push-up bra who's wasted
her entire life on superficial bullshit.

1410
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:42,500
I built you.

1411
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
I can just as easily
tear you down.

1412
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:48,042
Don't even think of going
to my party tomorrow night.

1413
01:14:48,125 --> 01:14:51,625
Well, you forgot one vital
difference between us, babe.

1414
01:14:52,292 --> 01:14:53,542
I'm alive.

1415
01:14:54,042 --> 01:14:57,083
I'm not spooked by some
jealous dead girl stomping her feet.

1416
01:14:57,167 --> 01:14:59,167
I'll go to that party
if I damn well please.

1417
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:01,042
Hell, I'm the one who
planned the thing!

1418
01:15:10,083 --> 01:15:12,917
Okay, I am a little spooked by a
jealous dead girl stomping her feet.

1419
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,792
And I am definitely not going
anywhere near that party tomorrow.

1420
01:15:17,292 --> 01:15:18,583
Hey, kid.

1421
01:15:19,375 --> 01:15:21,208
What? School on
Saturday?

1422
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,917
Word on the street is, uh,

1423
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,761
you had a little freak out last
night, and I thought I'd check on you.

1424
01:15:27,833 --> 01:15:29,042
I've been looking for you.

1425
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:31,792
I'm sorry, but I...

1426
01:15:32,375 --> 01:15:33,958
I can't talk to
you anymore, Gary.

1427
01:15:34,042 --> 01:15:35,875
I just wanna be normal.

1428
01:15:37,167 --> 01:15:39,458
Oh, Darby, don't you
think you're normal?

1429
01:15:40,125 --> 01:15:41,125
Uh…

1430
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:43,792
To clarify, I wanna be

1431
01:15:43,875 --> 01:15:46,542
the-girl-who-doesn't-talk-to-dead-people
version of normal.

1432
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:47,625
How about that?

1433
01:15:47,708 --> 01:15:50,750
Well, honey, you know, but that's...
That's kind of what makes you, you.

1434
01:15:50,833 --> 01:15:53,542
Have you maybe talked
to Capri about this?

1435
01:15:53,625 --> 01:15:55,125
Maybe a friend your
age could help...

1436
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:56,792
I'm not talking to Capri.

1437
01:15:57,417 --> 01:15:59,000
She's not my friend.
She never was.

1438
01:15:59,083 --> 01:16:01,125
She just used me like a pawn.

1439
01:16:02,833 --> 01:16:05,083
Well, yeah, I guess…

1440
01:16:06,333 --> 01:16:08,750
I guess, uh, that's one
way of looking at it.

1441
01:16:08,833 --> 01:16:11,708
But... You know, but from
a different point of view,

1442
01:16:11,792 --> 01:16:15,250
maybe she's the one who opened you up
to a whole new world of possibilities.

1443
01:16:15,333 --> 01:16:17,417
She didn't do anything for me.

1444
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:20,000
She's just another loser
Stayer who can't move on.

1445
01:16:20,708 --> 01:16:21,708
Oh.

1446
01:16:23,958 --> 01:16:26,667
Well, I'm sorry you
feel that way, Darby.

1447
01:16:33,667 --> 01:16:36,542
<i>After losing their daughter,
Capricorn, just a month ago,</i>

1448
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:39,125
<i>more tragedy strikes
the Donahue residence.</i>

1449
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:42,583
<i>Police are asking anyone with knowledge
of the arson attack to come forward.</i>

1450
01:16:48,333 --> 01:16:50,083
Hey, sweetie.
Dinner's ready.

1451
01:16:52,958 --> 01:16:54,667
Uh, I'll get it.

1452
01:16:56,208 --> 01:16:57,458
James?

1453
01:16:57,958 --> 01:16:59,708
Can you take a drive
with me, please?

1454
01:17:04,125 --> 01:17:06,226
I'm freaking out right now.
This is gonna sound crazy,

1455
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:08,708
but I feel like Capri is
communicating with me.

1456
01:17:08,792 --> 01:17:10,833
Like today, her picture
fell off my dresser,

1457
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:13,708
and, I don't know, the TV turned
on without me even touching it,

1458
01:17:13,792 --> 01:17:16,432
and it was playing the news story
about the party tonight! And I...

1459
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,917
- I-I swear it happened.
- Oh, I'm sure it did.

1460
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,417
It's been a rough day.

1461
01:17:21,917 --> 01:17:24,333
This grief stuff comes in waves.

1462
01:17:24,417 --> 01:17:25,417
Mmm.

1463
01:17:27,583 --> 01:17:28,750
Also, I'm sorry, Darby.

1464
01:17:30,625 --> 01:17:32,505
I don't think I'm ready
to be in a relationship.

1465
01:17:32,542 --> 01:17:35,958
Oh, thank God that
you told me that.

1466
01:17:36,042 --> 01:17:39,042
Because I-I was thinking
something else was happening.

1467
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,708
But I hope we can
still be friends.

1468
01:17:43,292 --> 01:17:45,708
Yeah. Yeah, of course, James.

1469
01:17:45,792 --> 01:17:47,333
I-I appreciate your honesty.

1470
01:17:48,042 --> 01:17:49,417
My heart will go on.

1471
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:55,208
I can't believe we fake dated,
and I for real got broken up with.

1472
01:18:00,125 --> 01:18:02,500
This is not good.
This is very not good.

1473
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:05,458
James, I thought you
were protesting this.

1474
01:18:05,542 --> 01:18:08,393
Taylor, Piper and Bree are using
Capri's death to up their social status.

1475
01:18:08,417 --> 01:18:10,583
- It's sick, remember?
- I don't care about them!

1476
01:18:10,667 --> 01:18:12,333
Okay? I wanna say
goodbye to Capri.

1477
01:18:12,417 --> 01:18:15,083
Well, well, if it
isn't the happy couple.

1478
01:18:15,583 --> 01:18:16,792
I'm here for Capri.

1479
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:20,092
Not to promote myself under the guise
of some bogus awareness campaign.

1480
01:18:20,167 --> 01:18:23,042
Sure it's not to ruin another
party with an acoustic guitar?

1481
01:18:23,125 --> 01:18:27,250
You mean the bogus awareness
campaign your new girlfriend came up with?

1482
01:18:27,333 --> 01:18:28,333
What?

1483
01:18:29,083 --> 01:18:30,708
This was your idea?

1484
01:18:30,792 --> 01:18:32,934
- Not that she bothered to dress up.
- Mm-mmm.

1485
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:35,042
The theme's Coachella,
not Stagecoach.

1486
01:18:35,542 --> 01:18:38,625
No, I-I mean, not... not technically.

1487
01:18:38,708 --> 01:18:40,917
Look, I can explain in the
car, but we should go. Now.

1488
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,417
Darby, it's not cool that
the two of you came together.

1489
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:44,542
Capri would be so pissed.

1490
01:18:45,125 --> 01:18:47,667
- Oh.
- Oh. Oh, my God. No.

1491
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:50,083
No. No!

1492
01:18:50,167 --> 01:18:52,083
Those were supposed
to go off at midnight!

1493
01:18:52,167 --> 01:18:55,333
Go. Go. Go.

1494
01:18:55,417 --> 01:18:58,833
Really, you're gonna go full
<i>Poltergeist</i> on a keg party?

1495
01:18:59,667 --> 01:19:01,750
Wow, Capri.

1496
01:19:01,833 --> 01:19:06,292
Ah, this must be the electrocution
awareness part of the festivities.

1497
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,167
Alex?

1498
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:10,792
What are you doing here?

1499
01:19:10,875 --> 01:19:13,167
You know, I'm never gonna
pass on a free drink

1500
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:17,500
and a chance to see the party's latest
Coachella fashion trends.

1501
01:19:18,083 --> 01:19:21,917
Sorry, I'm sure you don't wanna be
seen talking to the weirdo donut kid.

1502
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,250
You're cool now.

1503
01:19:25,208 --> 01:19:26,250
Have a good night, Darby.

1504
01:19:27,708 --> 01:19:28,833
Wait. No, no.

1505
01:19:28,917 --> 01:19:31,042
I mean, I'm a weirdo
too.

1506
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:34,458
Or, at least, I used to be.

1507
01:19:34,958 --> 01:19:37,083
Chug! Chug! Chug!

1508
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:50,083
Hey, what's up, Darbs?

1509
01:19:50,167 --> 01:19:51,851
- You all good?
- Yeah, have you seen James?

1510
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:54,042
Uh, yeah, yeah. I think, uh,
I think he went upstairs.

1511
01:19:54,125 --> 01:19:56,292
But look, James looked
kinda bummed, Darbs.

1512
01:19:59,542 --> 01:20:00,625
James.

1513
01:20:01,167 --> 01:20:02,500
Hey, J-James.

1514
01:20:03,125 --> 01:20:05,167
She's here. She's really here.

1515
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:08,167
Who's here? I don't see anyone.

1516
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:10,917
Look, this is just a stupid
game, okay? It doesn't work.

1517
01:20:16,208 --> 01:20:17,708
Hi, bitch.

1518
01:20:17,792 --> 01:20:19,583
It's okay. Don't
be scared. It's her.

1519
01:20:19,667 --> 01:20:21,375
She's trying to
tell me something.

1520
01:20:21,458 --> 01:20:22,542
I know she's here.

1521
01:20:26,792 --> 01:20:27,875
I think it's about you.

1522
01:20:28,833 --> 01:20:31,167
It would be a lot easier
if you just came clean

1523
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:32,810
and told everyone
what a freak you are.

1524
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:43,140
- Did you see that?
- Is that an Ouija board?

1525
01:20:43,583 --> 01:20:45,083
Who is doing that? Stop!

1526
01:20:48,625 --> 01:20:49,625
Shit.

1527
01:20:52,125 --> 01:20:54,205
- Nearly hit me, man.
- Freaky.

1528
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:55,250
Follow it.

1529
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:57,125
Go, go, go.

1530
01:20:57,708 --> 01:20:59,458
Hey,
cut the music, man.

1531
01:20:59,542 --> 01:21:02,333
Is someone flying a freaking
drone in my uncle's house?

1532
01:21:02,417 --> 01:21:04,542
Dude, did
they hire a magician?

1533
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:06,875
James, what is going on?

1534
01:21:06,958 --> 01:21:09,438
I'd hold off on preparing
that Homecoming Queen speech.

1535
01:21:10,125 --> 01:21:12,685
I don't think you're gonna test
too well in the polls after this.

1536
01:21:16,708 --> 01:21:18,708
Who cut
the music, man?

1537
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:20,458
Oh, my God.

1538
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,833
- Uh...
- Is anyone else seeing this too?

1539
01:21:22,917 --> 01:21:25,167
Is this a drama club
thing or something?

1540
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:27,000
I'm scared.
Get me out of here.

1541
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:32,292
C-A-P-R-I.

1542
01:21:32,375 --> 01:21:33,833
Capri? Capri!

1543
01:21:33,917 --> 01:21:35,458
- Oh, my God!
- This is freaky.

1544
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:40,750
Okay, cut the shit.
You're scaring people.

1545
01:21:40,833 --> 01:21:43,833
- I told you not to come here.
- Darby, you can see her?

1546
01:21:43,917 --> 01:21:45,393
- What's he talking about?
- I...

1547
01:21:45,417 --> 01:21:46,833
- Who?
- Huh?

1548
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:48,750
Okay, fine.

1549
01:21:48,833 --> 01:21:50,208
You win. What do you want?

1550
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:52,250
Surprise me.

1551
01:21:54,208 --> 01:21:55,833
What is even happening?

1552
01:21:55,917 --> 01:21:57,677
- No, where's she...
- Darby!

1553
01:21:57,750 --> 01:22:00,375
- No, no, no. Oh, she's... she's up there.
- Okay.

1554
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:02,958
- That's happening.
- Hey, guys! Guess what?

1555
01:22:03,458 --> 01:22:05,542
I'm a freak of nature
who can see dead people.

1556
01:22:07,417 --> 01:22:11,625
I'm only popular because the ghost of
Capri Donahue molded me into her image.

1557
01:22:11,708 --> 01:22:13,292
I'm just a puppet!

1558
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:15,095
Yeah, I'm loving this
narrative. Keep going.

1559
01:22:15,167 --> 01:22:18,750
She told me what to wear and
what to say and how to act

1560
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:20,042
in order to make friends,

1561
01:22:20,792 --> 01:22:22,500
and it worked.

1562
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:29,292
She instilled confidence
in me when I had none.

1563
01:22:30,667 --> 01:22:32,625
I was just an insecure hater

1564
01:22:32,708 --> 01:22:38,000
who hid in the corner judging all of
you for just being normal teenagers.

1565
01:22:39,417 --> 01:22:43,750
But, I mean, none of us
are... Are normal, really.

1566
01:22:44,333 --> 01:22:49,250
We're all flawed and insecure
and beautiful and ugly...

1567
01:22:49,833 --> 01:22:51,542
- You're not ugly.
- Oh, you either.

1568
01:22:51,625 --> 01:22:54,250
I couldn't see that from
inside my closed-minded shell.

1569
01:22:55,667 --> 01:22:56,833
Capri changed that.

1570
01:22:58,042 --> 01:22:59,125
Capri was special.

1571
01:23:00,167 --> 01:23:01,250
And I'm…

1572
01:23:04,792 --> 01:23:05,875
Wrap it up.

1573
01:23:06,375 --> 01:23:07,708
…just a freak show.

1574
01:23:08,292 --> 01:23:11,375
- Boo! You suck!
- What a fake.

1575
01:23:11,458 --> 01:23:14,667
Hey, Ghost Cheerleader, can you,
like, turn the music back on?

1576
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:15,917
All right, posers.

1577
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,458
Put your mother freakin' hands up! Yeah!

1578
01:23:26,083 --> 01:23:27,375
Yeah!

1579
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:32,667
Cannonball!

1580
01:24:18,458 --> 01:24:21,458
You'd think the ghost of a dead
cheerleader crashing her own party

1581
01:24:21,542 --> 01:24:22,833
would result in total chaos.

1582
01:24:22,917 --> 01:24:26,250
But people like to find an
explanation for the inexplicable.

1583
01:24:26,333 --> 01:24:29,667
No, I'm telling you, dude,
someone laced the keg with Molly.

1584
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:31,458
Brody told me.

1585
01:24:31,542 --> 01:24:34,583
But there were magnets attached
to the bottom of the Ouija Board.

1586
01:24:34,667 --> 01:24:36,583
I saw 'em when it
flew over my head.

1587
01:24:37,167 --> 01:24:40,417
And others seem to simply ignore
what they cannot understand.

1588
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:43,250
You missed an epic party,
bro. You hear what happened?

1589
01:24:43,333 --> 01:24:45,583
Coop streaked the crowd and
cannonballed into the pool.

1590
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,500
<i>In the span of a month,</i>

1591
01:24:49,583 --> 01:24:51,042
- <i>I'd gone from…</i>
- It's her!

1592
01:24:51,125 --> 01:24:52,292
<i>…invisible,</i>

1593
01:24:52,958 --> 01:24:54,500
<i>to queen bee,</i>

1594
01:24:55,417 --> 01:24:57,125
<i>to social poison.</i>

1595
01:25:02,333 --> 01:25:04,042
She totally
lost her shit.

1596
01:25:05,208 --> 01:25:08,167
<i>"Oh, my
God. That is all Facetune."</i>

1597
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:11,083
<i>You pretend to see dead
people. Hashtag cancel Darby Harper.</i>

1598
01:25:14,292 --> 01:25:16,750
<i>The phrase, "I wouldn't
be caught dead with you"</i>

1599
01:25:16,833 --> 01:25:19,042
<i>has never been more accurate.</i>

1600
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:32,625
It's so weird
to admit it now.

1601
01:25:32,708 --> 01:25:34,417
But you're my best...

1602
01:25:36,042 --> 01:25:37,792
My only friend.

1603
01:25:38,458 --> 01:25:41,250
Oh, come on. You don't wanna hurt
Gary's feelings, now, do you?

1604
01:25:41,958 --> 01:25:43,833
You're still here?

1605
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:45,500
Yeah.

1606
01:25:46,208 --> 01:25:48,250
After you left the
party, I realized…

1607
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:52,085
I shouldn't have forced
you to become someone else

1608
01:25:52,167 --> 01:25:53,833
just so I could
have a stupid party.

1609
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:56,208
Sorry.

1610
01:25:56,292 --> 01:25:58,625
Yeah, it
was a pretty stupid party.

1611
01:26:01,917 --> 01:26:04,333
But, hey, at least I got
a cool pet out of it.

1612
01:26:07,542 --> 01:26:08,833
I named it Capricorn.

1613
01:26:10,792 --> 01:26:12,792
God, I can't
believe I acted like

1614
01:26:12,875 --> 01:26:15,750
some kind of pathetic
attention-seeking haunter.

1615
01:26:16,917 --> 01:26:18,042
Flying around?

1616
01:26:18,125 --> 01:26:19,583
Scaring high schoolers? Ugh.

1617
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:22,542
And now James is a mess.

1618
01:26:22,625 --> 01:26:26,208
He sits in front of a Ouija Board all
day and lays out cookies at night.

1619
01:26:26,292 --> 01:26:27,708
Like I'm Santa
Claus or something.

1620
01:26:27,792 --> 01:26:28,792
Oh.

1621
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:30,500
Yeah.

1622
01:26:31,833 --> 01:26:33,458
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

1623
01:26:33,542 --> 01:26:35,875
I've totally blown it with
the guy I actually do like.

1624
01:26:35,958 --> 01:26:37,042
Wait, what?

1625
01:26:37,875 --> 01:26:39,625
I never got coffee
with the donut.

1626
01:26:40,208 --> 01:26:41,250
Donut?

1627
01:26:41,833 --> 01:26:43,833
The guy you called
social suicide.

1628
01:26:43,917 --> 01:26:45,583
Oh, God.

1629
01:26:46,375 --> 01:26:50,458
Don't listen to me, or
Taylor or Bree or Piper.

1630
01:26:51,125 --> 01:26:52,125
We're full of shit.

1631
01:26:53,167 --> 01:26:55,327
You're the one who should
decide who and what you like.

1632
01:26:55,375 --> 01:26:57,458
I'm digging this
woke Barbie vibe.

1633
01:26:57,542 --> 01:26:59,250
Thanks. She's new.

1634
01:27:01,083 --> 01:27:02,542
How are you feeling
about moving on?

1635
01:27:03,333 --> 01:27:05,792
I'm… …so ready.

1636
01:27:06,375 --> 01:27:08,333
I've already confronted
my worst fear.

1637
01:27:08,417 --> 01:27:10,542
Being in the same outfit
for more than a week.

1638
01:27:12,917 --> 01:27:13,917
Anyway,

1639
01:27:15,083 --> 01:27:18,250
I felt pretty terrible about what I
said about your mom the other night.

1640
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:21,917
And it made me realize how
selfish I've been all these years.

1641
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,750
So I did some asking around.

1642
01:27:24,333 --> 01:27:25,333
And...

1643
01:27:27,292 --> 01:27:28,292
Hi, Darby.

1644
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:31,833
You did stay.

1645
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:34,958
- Yes.
- But you never...

1646
01:27:35,042 --> 01:27:36,583
I never wanted to leave you.

1647
01:27:39,583 --> 01:27:42,542
I tried to move on. But…

1648
01:27:43,167 --> 01:27:45,417
I wanted to make sure
that you'd be okay…

1649
01:27:47,167 --> 01:27:49,000
and open up your
heart to people again.

1650
01:27:51,167 --> 01:27:52,333
Living people.

1651
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:55,750
And you have.

1652
01:27:58,833 --> 01:28:00,583
You were my unfinished
business, Darby.

1653
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:16,333
Do you believe
in reincarnation?

1654
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:18,732
I was pretty fortunate
in this life,

1655
01:28:18,792 --> 01:28:21,083
so I figure in the next
one, I'll level up and be…

1656
01:28:21,583 --> 01:28:23,792
the next Meghan Markle or something.

1657
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:31,625
Promise you'll look after James
and let him know that I moved on?

1658
01:28:32,875 --> 01:28:34,000
Yeah, I promise.

1659
01:28:38,917 --> 01:28:41,833
Thank you for forcibly

1660
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,958
and, at times,
somewhat violently

1661
01:28:45,625 --> 01:28:47,125
pushing me out of my cocoon.

1662
01:28:47,625 --> 01:28:51,792
You are definitely the coolest, most
special-est person I've ever met.

1663
01:28:53,208 --> 01:28:54,875
Right back at you. Seriously.

1664
01:28:54,958 --> 01:28:56,000
Obviously.

1665
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:17,417
Bye, bitch.

1666
01:29:30,542 --> 01:29:32,458
<i>You know, I don't
consider high school</i>

1667
01:29:32,542 --> 01:29:34,167
<i>to be so torturous anymore.</i>

1668
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:35,250
Hey, Harper.

1669
01:29:35,333 --> 01:29:38,125
<i>My fake boyfriend turned
out to be a real friend.</i>

1670
01:29:38,208 --> 01:29:40,000
- Harris.
- Yeah!

1671
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:41,083
Whoa!

1672
01:29:42,292 --> 01:29:43,458
<i>And I stayed in cheer.</i>

1673
01:29:44,083 --> 01:29:47,292
<i>It makes me feel closer to a
couple pretty important people.</i>

1674
01:29:52,458 --> 01:29:53,958
Hey, Darby.

1675
01:29:55,667 --> 01:29:56,708
Hey, Gary.

1676
01:29:57,167 --> 01:29:58,208
Been a while.

1677
01:29:59,583 --> 01:30:00,583
Uh...

1678
01:30:01,083 --> 01:30:05,000
Listen, I-I wanna apologize
for the way I behaved.

1679
01:30:05,083 --> 01:30:06,763
What are you talking
about? You kidding me?

1680
01:30:06,833 --> 01:30:09,792
Come on. This... This stuff can
get pretty confusing, right?

1681
01:30:09,875 --> 01:30:11,125
Yeah.

1682
01:30:11,208 --> 01:30:12,708
Hey, by the way, you know.

1683
01:30:13,458 --> 01:30:16,583
They took Linda to a hospice.
She doesn't have long.

1684
01:30:17,208 --> 01:30:18,208
Wow.

1685
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:21,167
- Gary, that's fantastic news.
- I know.

1686
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:24,833
I know, I know, now we can finally
blow this pop stand, and...

1687
01:30:25,583 --> 01:30:26,583
And be together again.

1688
01:30:29,208 --> 01:30:31,042
Oh, shoot.

1689
01:30:31,125 --> 01:30:34,667
Um, I feel horrible about never
delivering that message for Mel.

1690
01:30:34,750 --> 01:30:36,500
- Oh.
- Do you know where his son lives?

1691
01:30:36,583 --> 01:30:40,208
That's okay, the, uh, the
donut took care of that.

1692
01:30:40,292 --> 01:30:41,708
- The what?
- The donut.

1693
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:42,792
What do you...

1694
01:30:42,875 --> 01:30:46,375
- Hey, Gary. Looking good.
- Thanks.

1695
01:30:46,458 --> 01:30:49,208
- See you.
- Take it easy, man.

1696
01:30:49,292 --> 01:30:50,292
What?

1697
01:30:50,375 --> 01:30:52,250
Wait, you can see him too?

1698
01:30:53,708 --> 01:30:55,875
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you tell me?

1699
01:30:55,958 --> 01:30:57,167
I tried.

1700
01:30:57,250 --> 01:30:59,167
My first day here I saw
you talking to Gary.

1701
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:01,375
But not something
you just blurt out.

1702
01:31:01,458 --> 01:31:05,625
Then I tried to get you someplace private
to tell you, and you didn't show up.

1703
01:31:06,708 --> 01:31:07,708
Right.

1704
01:31:07,792 --> 01:31:09,583
Well, but... but how?

1705
01:31:09,667 --> 01:31:12,667
I was in a coma last year after
a pretty bad car accident,

1706
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:14,000
and when I woke up,

1707
01:31:14,083 --> 01:31:16,792
I became really good friends with
the guy in the bed next to me,

1708
01:31:17,292 --> 01:31:19,333
only to realize he had
died two days earlier.

1709
01:31:20,208 --> 01:31:21,208
Wow.

1710
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:23,875
The head shrinker said it was
a psychotic hallucination.

1711
01:31:23,958 --> 01:31:25,351
My parents freaked out.

1712
01:31:25,375 --> 01:31:26,542
Took me out of school.

1713
01:31:27,625 --> 01:31:30,125
I got so good at pretending
not to see the dead

1714
01:31:30,208 --> 01:31:32,500
that the dead didn't even
know I could see them.

1715
01:31:34,292 --> 01:31:36,333
You know, helping
Mel cross over,

1716
01:31:36,417 --> 01:31:41,000
it was like, finally, this curse
felt like it could be a gift.

1717
01:31:42,792 --> 01:31:45,792
Yeah, uh, wow.

1718
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:48,042
Look, I just need a second.

1719
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,125
I can't believe this.

1720
01:31:50,208 --> 01:31:52,917
I mean, I've never been able
to talk to anyone about this.

1721
01:31:53,417 --> 01:31:56,667
Well, anyone that's living anyway,
except you, but you're not really here.

1722
01:31:56,750 --> 01:31:58,583
You're wherever
you are.

1723
01:31:58,667 --> 01:32:00,500
Who are you talk... Oh.

1724
01:32:02,083 --> 01:32:03,083
Hi.

1725
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:05,958
Wait, you... you
can see them too?

1726
01:32:06,458 --> 01:32:07,708
Yeah, sure. I see them,

1727
01:32:07,792 --> 01:32:08,958
and I see them.

1728
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:12,500
And I see you,

1729
01:32:13,708 --> 01:32:15,042
Darby Harper.

1730
01:32:17,458 --> 01:32:21,250
Well, I'm reopening my business
and currently taking applications.

1731
01:32:21,333 --> 01:32:24,208
Well, I-I was an assistant
manager at Jamba Juice.

1732
01:32:24,292 --> 01:32:26,083
Wow, impressive.

1733
01:32:26,167 --> 01:32:27,167
Reason for leaving?

1734
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:29,708
Got committed to a psych
ward for seeing dead people.

1735
01:32:29,792 --> 01:32:31,542
- You're hired.
- It's a date.

1736
01:32:34,583 --> 01:32:35,875
Oh, G...

1737
01:32:37,125 --> 01:32:38,500
That practice killed me.

1738
01:32:38,583 --> 01:32:40,583
Yeah, it was
brutal.

1739
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:42,625
I got a date with the donut.

1740
01:32:42,708 --> 01:32:43,708
Yeah, you do.

1741
01:32:44,208 --> 01:32:45,708
- Nice.
- That's so sweet.

1742
01:32:45,792 --> 01:32:47,250
- Yeah.
- I love you.

1743
01:32:58,917 --> 01:32:59,917
Hey, what's that?

1744
01:33:00,417 --> 01:33:03,167
That is a light kit
for your videos.

1745
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:04,708
So you can get your glamour on.

1746
01:33:04,792 --> 01:33:09,375
Oh. Thanks,
Dad. You're the best. But…

1747
01:33:10,292 --> 01:33:11,958
Uh, you can return it though.

1748
01:33:12,042 --> 01:33:14,208
- I'm not making those videos anymore.
- Why not?

1749
01:33:14,292 --> 01:33:18,667
Mostly because social media makes us
feel insecure about the way we look

1750
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:21,875
for the sole purpose of selling
us stuff we don't need.

1751
01:33:21,958 --> 01:33:25,417
Oh, now that is the
Darby Harper that I know.

1752
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:26,833
So,

1753
01:33:26,917 --> 01:33:29,542
are you going out with your
friends for dinner tonight?

1754
01:33:30,417 --> 01:33:35,750
Actually, I was thinking maybe we
could order pizza and share stories.

1755
01:33:44,292 --> 01:33:46,208
We should
do that together.

1756
01:33:46,292 --> 01:33:49,000
Mm-hmm. I don't
know if I could.

1757
01:33:49,083 --> 01:33:50,542
You could.

1758
01:33:52,958 --> 01:33:54,458
Oh, that was before we moved.

1759
01:33:55,083 --> 01:33:56,667
- Yeah.
- That was the best.

1760
01:34:00,708 --> 01:34:02,792
The slide. We should
have kept that.

1761
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,917
Ah, that was so fun.

1762
01:34:46,833 --> 01:34:47,917
Wait, me too?

1763
01:34:58,208 --> 01:34:59,625
Hey. How are you?

1764
01:34:59,708 --> 01:35:01,208
I'm fine. How are you?

1765
01:35:11,583 --> 01:35:12,708
Get a room.
