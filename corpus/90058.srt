1
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,040
This is almost a day behind us.

2
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,960
Well, who are they?

3
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,880
Americans? Brits? Italians?

4
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,480
It doesn't even say.

5
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,680
Well, I think we can assume
they're friendly, Mr. Loomis.

6
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,400
Besides, it doesn't appear
to be a suggestion, does it?

7
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,680
What the hell?

8
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,520
Might get a Silver Star
out of this patrol yet.

9
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Just have Coors plot it out.

10
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,920
Gunners mate standing by, sir.

11
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,160
Stow the weapons.
They're British.

12
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,160
...You can tell that from here?
...It's the sail.

13
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,560
The krauts use white on their
lifeboats. The Brits use red.

14
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,960
Don't they teach you that
in OCS, ensign?

15
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,920
Afraid not, but I can recite
the submariners' motto in Latin.

16
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,080
Radar contact... starboard
beam, seven miles out, sir.

17
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,160
God damn it!

18
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,360
What if they see us?

19
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,760
Well, they're pouring on
the coal for somebody.

20
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,680
All ahead... emergency.
Rudder to midship.

21
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,640
Crew to battle stations.

22
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,080
All ahead... emergency.
Rudder to midship.

23
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,520
All crew to battle stations.

24
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,080
All right,
do this at flank speed!

25
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,160
I want you to grab
what's breathing on that boat

26
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,880
and you leave
everything else behind!

27
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,840
Stand by to board survivors.

28
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,000
I got him! I got him!

29
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,000
Wounded coming down.

30
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,280
Next man, let's go.

31
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,240
Come on!

32
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,000
There's a warship approaching,
guys.

33
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,120
Let's move! Move!
I ntroductions later!

34
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,120
Ow! Ow! I'm going, okay?!

35
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,600
Next man. Next m...

36
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,560
What have we here?

37
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,120
Let's pull the plug.

38
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,640
...Periscope depth.

39
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,240
Periscope depth,
make your depth 65 feet.

40
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,080
Make depth 6-5 feet.

41
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,920
Bleed air in the boat.

42
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,160
Bleed air in the boat.

43
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,200
All hatches indicate closed.

44
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,960
All vents indicate open.

45
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,760
Pressure in the boat.

46
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,400
Pressure in the boat.

47
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,440
It's a two-stacker...

48
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,640
about 3,000 tons.

49
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,520
It's not a friendly.

50
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,320
Possible Z-class.

51
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,080
If it is, rear recs,
no side throwers,

52
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,800
four 5-inch guns,
grapple hooks.

53
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,080
Fast screws, Mr. Brice.

54
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,880
30 knots or better.

55
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,640
2-5-0 feet.

56
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,280
Make it 2-5-0 feet.

57
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,360
...2-5-0 feet.
...Hard left rudder.

58
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,320
Hard left rudder.

59
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,040
Live to fight another day.

60
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,000
Smart move.

61
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,480
Three survivors... Brits...
and get this...

62
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,200
one's a woman.

63
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,840
Three Brits... one's a skirt.

64
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,560
Three limeys... one's a female.

65
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,520
Hey.

66
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,120
Three Brits... one female.

67
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,880
Guys, listen up.

68
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,040
We've got three survivors...
all Brits.

69
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,480
One's a woman, eh?

70
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,840
Hey, look lively.
Woman onboard.

71
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,600
Hey, Hoag, spread the news...
three tea bags,

72
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,320
and I hear one's, uh,
bazooma.

73
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,080
We got ourselves a filly?

74
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,320
Ohh!

75
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,520
Sweet holy Jesus.

76
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,360
You're gonna wanna hear this.

77
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,880
Hey, boys... here's the news.

78
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,640
Front page...

79
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,840
we got three redcoats,
and guess what.

80
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,920
One of them's a bleeder.

81
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,960
Aw, great.
That's all this boat needs...

82
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,560
another piece of rotten luck.

83
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,480
Yeah, well,
if it means you guys

84
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,600
finally wash the butt squirt
outta your shorts,

85
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,800
I'm all for it.

86
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,120
So what exactly happened
to your shi...

87
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,720
Um... your ship?

88
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,200
Hospital ship.

89
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,840
We were attacked two nights ago.

90
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,720
Two nights?

91
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,760
I'm... I'm sorry.
My brain's a bit foggy.

92
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
Although I'm reasonably sure
my name's Claire Page.

93
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,720
The rest of the details
will emerge, I'm sure.

94
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,840
That's just a whale.

95
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,280
It's okay, really.

96
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,840
The sounds down here
still get to me, too.

97
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,400
Make a hole.
Comin' through. Make a hole.

98
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,680
Yow.
Mind your pretty toes.

99
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,760
Best-Iookin' bad luck
I ever saw.

100
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,680
Doesn't look good, sir.

101
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,720
Why don't you get
those clothes off of him

102
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,680
and see if you can get
a better look at the wounds?

103
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,080
I can dress the wounds.

104
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,920
Other than that, I think
it's best to leave him be.

105
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,120
Okay. All right.

106
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,040
Maybe I didn't make myself
clear.

107
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,800
I saw it.

108
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,160
It crossed the moon's reflection
just before the explosion.

109
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,440
Yes, it was dark, but I...
I did see it.

110
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,720
It wasn't a mine.

111
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,720
I-It was a U-boat.

112
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,400
What class?

113
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,120
Type 7?

114
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,760
Was it an older boat
or one of their newer ones?

115
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,120
Um...

116
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,720
Like this?
Clean at the bow?

117
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,160
...You know...
...No net cutter?

118
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,360
It was just a couple of seconds.
I really couldn't say for...

119
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,120
So you were... you were on
lookout that night, mister...

120
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,000
Kingsley...
second mate, merchant navy.

121
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,960
Uh, no.

122
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,520
I was on the starboard deck
grabbing a gasper.

123
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,400
Having a cigarette.

124
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,040
And how many aboard your ship?

125
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,960
About 300 patients.

126
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,160
At least that many.

127
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,880
Out of North Africa.

128
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,360
Yeah, plus over 70 hands crew.

129
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,480
So, um...

130
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,360
You said they fired
only one torpedo?

131
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,360
O'Dell...

132
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,040
you better tell sonar we've got
an enemy sub in the area.

133
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,400
Yes, sir.
Just let me finish...

134
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,560
Now. Do it now.

135
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,600
Yes, sir.

136
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,200
I'm... I'm sorry that
we couldn't save more. I...

137
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,120
Now this... the third member
of your party, he's...

138
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,680
One of my patients.

139
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,000
Well, under normal
circumstances,

140
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,880
I'd be able to drop you
at the nearest port in England,

141
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,440
but, uh, it's a 300-mile
detour for us.

142
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,520
So I'm sorry.

143
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,960
It seems as though
we're stuck with each other.

144
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,880
Oh, uh, last thing.

145
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,400
Just try not to fraternize
with the men.

146
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,680
Most of the men are fine,

147
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,400
but some of them get a little
strange about having...

148
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,640
"Strange"
as in "superstitious"?

149
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,840
As in "strange. "

150
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,560
"Suddenly, his heart rolled over
backwards in his chest,

151
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,040
"and he saw this huge,
wretched thing before him.

152
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,560
"I nstantly, its mouth widened

153
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,760
"into a terrible
and hungry menace.

154
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,440
Now the malediction
uttered a deep-throated sound. "

155
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,680
...Malediction?
...Look it up.

156
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,320
"And its breath stank gloriously

157
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,920
"of rotted carp
and matted gorilla skins.

158
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,440
"Now... it slouched toward him...

159
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,600
"not fast, but slowly...

160
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,040
"slowly...

161
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,040
so very slowly. "

162
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,040
Silly boy.
Just the bulkhead shifting.

163
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,600
What'd you think it was?

164
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,480
The malediction?

165
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,640
Wahh!

166
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,560
What exactly bothers you,
O'Dell?

167
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,880
Well, you have a ship

168
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,040
that's sinking slow enough
to get a few lifeboats off,

169
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,560
but the submarine
only fires one torpedo.

170
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,040
I mean,
that's not textbook tactics.

171
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,000
You fire upon the target
until the target is sunk.

172
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,880
So it was their last torpedo.

173
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,560
Yeah, but...
why not use a deck gun?

174
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,920
O'Dell, isn't this
your first patrol?

175
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,040
My second.

176
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,000
Yeah.

177
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,760
And your first was
a little shakedown run

178
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,800
off the coast of Florida

179
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,520
in one of those old school
boats, right?

180
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,320
I'm just wondering if the story
didn't seem a little off.

181
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,760
I wouldn't worry about it,
champ.

182
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,160
They got here somehow.

183
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,720
...You want coffee?
...Sure.

184
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,640
I take it black.

185
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,640
Tell Broadway
make sure it's hot.

186
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,400
Try to sleep.

187
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,120
I know you're in pain,
but you must try.

188
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,920
Please.

189
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,400
Be quiet.

190
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,080
Sonar contact.

191
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,640
220 turns per minute,
Mr. Brice.

192
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,600
Maybe the Z-class.

193
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,560
Maybe we didn't shake him
after all.

194
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,200
...Full stop!
...Full stop!

195
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,080
Boat stands at full stop.

196
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,520
Mr. Coors...

197
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,040
...flood negative.
...Flood negative.

198
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,440
O'Dell, get on the thermograph.
Find us some cold.

199
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,160
Conn, 5-degree gradient
at 2-7-0 feet.

200
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,480
Cold water deflects sound waves
just in case they decide to...

201
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,160
...Aah!

202
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,960
Splashes!

203
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,080
...Splashes!
...Splashes!

204
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
God damn it!
Keep it steady!

205
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,920
Scared you, didn't it, kid?

206
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,000
Damage reports.

207
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,120
Well, maybe that Z-class
just happened to be there.

208
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,280
And maybe the phonograph
wasn't secured.

209
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,520
But God damn.

210
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,440
And maybe someone doesn't
want us to make it home.

211
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,960
Miss Page claims she was in
the control room the whole time.

212
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,280
Yeah, that's right.

213
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,400
...So what about the other guy?
...Kingsley?

214
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,760
Hmph!
If that's his name.

215
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,360
Where was he
when it all happened?

216
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,400
I'm not sure.
Maybe he stepped out.

217
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,040
Stepped out... or slipped out?

218
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,280
You know, maybe we're spending
more time watching that broad

219
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,240
than watching our backs.

220
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,080
Who, me?
I've talked to her twice.

221
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,320
I heard you were
bird-dogging her, O'Dell.

222
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,120
Been running your mouth, ensign,
about boat matters?

223
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,360
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

224
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,200
As for the record player
going off,

225
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,520
well, yeah, that's strange.

226
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,080
But I don't think it calls for
a lynching party.

227
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,840
I think we should all
just take a deep breath.

228
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,400
...Conn, Brice.

229
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,400
Where'd you find it?

230
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,320
Make a hole!

231
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,720
Lieutenant, I was all set
to toss these pants,

232
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,840
then I noticed this, sir.

233
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,080
And these came from...

234
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,360
The half-dead guy, sir.

235
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,600
Must've been him
done that record player.

236
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,680
Wake him up.

237
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,600
I-I'm sorry.
I'm not quite sure...

238
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,480
Wake the German up.

239
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,400
Hello, "mein Kapitan".

240
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,360
Jesus.

241
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,320
It was me.
It was my idea.

242
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,320
I was the one who told him
not to speak.

243
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,280
She had him under our noses
the whole goddamn time.

244
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,400
Aah!

245
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,680
...Wait!
...I'll tell you.

246
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,360
I'll tell you everything.
His name is Ben Archerlift.

247
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,560
He's a downed aviator.
He's a patient of mine.

248
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,600
He's a prisoner of war,
and under the Geneva Convention,

249
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,880
he's entitled to
humane treatment!

250
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,200
He has a wife and family.

251
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,440
He wants to get home
just like you or me.

252
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,480
Everything will be all right.

253
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,400
You should've told me.

254
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,000
Maybe I was afraid you'd do
exactly what you've just done!

255
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,920
You should've told me
no matter what,

256
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,280
'cause your little secret nearly
cost every man here his life.

257
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,680
You had no cause.

258
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,560
Mr. O'Dell, the woman
is confined to quarters

259
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,600
for the duration
of the patrol.

260
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,960
If she asks to use the toilet,
you are to bring her a bucket.

261
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,800
Stumbo, clean up
that fuckin' mess.

262
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,200
Fucking A-1, sir.

263
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,080
I'll be in my berth...

264
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,920
sleeping.

265
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,640
I just wanted to save one.

266
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,680
Just...

267
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,480
one of my patients.

268
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,720
Aaaahh!

269
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,640
Look,
it's happened twice now.

270
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,080
I don't think
that's an accident.

271
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,360
Somebody is up to something.

272
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,440
Well, just so you know, I've
walked in the wardroom before

273
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,400
and found a steward listening
to the record player

274
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,680
while he was cleaning up.

275
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,360
...Now, I wouldn't blame him...
...Unless he's...

276
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,800
...Hey, Champ.
...Hey.

277
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,440
How are those hydrogen levels?

278
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,560
It's almost 3% .

279
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,640
Chief says we need to vent
before long.

280
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,560
All right. We'll ride
surface tonight... 2100.

281
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,920
Is there something else?

282
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,920
Yeah.

283
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,040
I just can't believe it's one
of our own hands doing this.

284
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,800
I've been on the boat
seven weeks now,

285
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,400
and I know most of the guys.

286
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,040
I just don't believe
it's one of them.

287
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,480
...Who are you suggesting?
...I'm not suggesting anybody.

288
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,400
You know,
it's been a rough patrol.

289
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,640
Some men do strange things
under duress.

290
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,560
So just keep your eyes open.

291
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,760
Yes, sir.

292
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,400
Bright kid, O'Dell.

293
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,720
Get off.

294
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,200
Get off before it's too late.

295
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,320
Down here.

296
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,360
I-I was awake.

297
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,720
I wasn't dreaming.
I know I was awake.

298
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,480
Don't let them get to you.

299
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,880
I heard a voice. I heard it.

300
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,520
It's nothing.

301
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,480
Just ignore them, all right?
Claire, are you listening?

302
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,720
...I thought he spoke to me.
...Claire...

303
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,360
It wasn't his voice,
but he spoke to me.

304
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,320
Claire!

305
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,240
...Is this your idea of a joke?
...Claire, don't.

306
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,520
Have you got nothing better
to do at a time of war

307
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,200
than play games
with dead bodies?!

308
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,280
You are on thin ice...
real thin ice.

309
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,400
Wrap it back up...

310
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,520
for the last time.

311
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,680
We'll dump him
when we surface.

312
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,440
A bit more respect for the dead
might be in order, Mr. Brice...

313
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,080
from everybody
onboard this ship.

314
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,120
This is a boat
you're a guest on, not a ship.

315
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,560
Get off
before it's too late!

316
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,040
Hoag, are you pushing him up
or feeling him up?

317
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,080
I've got a dead kraut dick in my
face, and you're complaining?

318
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,400
Come on, Stumbo!

319
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,720
You need to turn around.

320
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,280
Oh, nice try.

321
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,840
Hoag told you, right?

322
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,080
Turn around.

323
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,280
So many left behind.

324
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,800
I want...

325
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,240
God damn it!

326
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,520
What the hell
are you doing, Stumbo?

327
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,080
...Stumbo.

328
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,240
I'm telling you, there's some
bad hoodoo on this boat.

329
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,280
That might've worked on
the female, Stumbo, but not me.

330
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,640
Look, fuck the brillo pad.
This ain't about her.

331
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,760
He talked to me.

332
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,880
Oh, wow.
...The dead guy?

333
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,520
...The dead kraut talked to me.
...Yeah, right.

334
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,000
Wow.

335
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,920
Did he talk to you
in English or German?

336
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,800
I guess it was English.

337
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,880
Case closed.

338
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,240
Prepare to surface.
Prepare to surface.

339
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,680
Be ready on all four engines.
Stand by to charge batteries.

340
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,200
Let's go. Come on.

341
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,960
Move it, move it.

342
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,920
Okay, okay.

343
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,040
The chief's gonna
skin us alive.

344
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,560
I don't care what he said.

345
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,240
I've just got to get out
of that room.

346
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,520
Well...

347
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,240
make it quick, all right?

348
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,560
Switching to night lights.

349
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,160
Coming up to periscope depth.

350
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,440
Lookouts, gun crews... stand by.

351
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,000
"1420 hours:

352
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,320
"Took periscope photos
of German sub-pent at Lorient

353
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,880
"before moving on
to areas north.

354
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,360
"O. M. I. Should be happy
with results.

"1550 hours: Saw multiple
shipping targets,

362
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,760
Some tall grass out there.

363
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,640
Yeah, it's good skies,
though.

364
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,720
Oh, yeah.

365
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,280
Oh, we should be able to hit
a couple of sites,

366
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,840
affix our position.

367
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,760
Well done.

368
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,360
The sextant in my cabin.

369
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,400
Very well.

370
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,280
Is it possible
to see the...

371
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,920
Uh, talk to me later.

372
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,240
Mr. Coors, are we going to be
surfacing soon,

373
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,400
take on some fresh air?

374
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,280
...We're trying to.
...Any idea when that might be?

375
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,040
What are you doing here?

376
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,560
I-I wasn't comfortable
in my cabin,

377
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,160
what with the blood
on the walls.

378
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,840
You shouldn't be
in the skipper's cabin

379
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,880
without permission.

380
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,880
Well, I'll gladly ask him.

381
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,440
Mr. Brice is the skipper,
isn't he?

382
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,240
Lieutenant Brice is
the current C. O. Of the boat.

383
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,160
You need his permission
to be anywhere

384
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,120
besides your assigned quarters.

385
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,440
Now...

386
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,040
Sorry.

387
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,480
Motormac Jenkins
to the battery room.

388
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,800
Motormac Jenkins
to the battery room.

389
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,840
Screws kicking over,
starboard beam!

390
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,600
Emergency dive!

391
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,840
Emergency dive! Dive!
Flood negative!

392
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,760
Give me a 25-degree angle
on the bow plane!

393
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,680
25 on the bow plane, sir!

394
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,080
Used to feel like
a "big" ocean, didn't it?

395
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,880
We are running out of places
to hide.

396
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:23,240
Crow, give me one sounding
for depth on "their" ping.

397
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,440
...Got that?
...Yes, sir.

398
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,720
...3...

399
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,160
...2...

400
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,400
...1.

401
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,720
Not much there, sir.

402
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,920
Bring in the soundheads.
Let's use it all.

403
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,560
Aah!

404
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,080
What was that?

405
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,520
Don't ask me.

406
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,280
Ask him.

407
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,280
...What was that?
...Miss Page, once again,

408
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,080
I must remind you,
do not leave your station.

409
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,400
What did we hit just now?!

410
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,960
The bottom.

411
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,920
Well, how long can we afford
to stay down here?

412
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,160
I thought you said we needed
to surface to take on...

413
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,800
Attention all hands...

414
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,520
off-duty personnel are expected
to be in the racks.

415
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,000
And the smoking lamp is out.

416
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,200
I guess we're gonna find out.

417
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,040
Seaweed.

418
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,520
Might be a fishing net.

419
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,080
It's caught up,
slaps against the hull.

420
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,200
You hear... you hear a lot
of strange things at depth.

421
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,320
I mean, I can't even
identify 'em all.

422
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,720
So...

423
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,080
What am I gonna do with you?

424
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,360
I'm sorry.

425
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,200
I regret not telling you
about Schillings...

426
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,080
because... well,
l-I should have realized

427
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,160
that a submarine isn't
a good place to keep secrets.

428
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,440
Is it?

429
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,800
We'd been stalking
a German sub tender for a while.

430
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,400
We finally got our shot in,

431
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,160
cracked its back
with one torpedo.

432
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,640
We went topside to survey the
damage, and the ship was gone.

433
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,680
But there's a lot of debris
in the water,

434
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,400
and Captain Winters decides
to go down and haul some in.

435
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,160
It was the middle
of the Atlantic.

436
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,600
He wants to do
some souvenir hunting,

437
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,120
get something for his... I don't
know... his mantle piece.

438
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,360
I try to talk him out of it,
and... but he's al...

439
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,480
Anyway, he... the boat hit
an underwater obstruction,

440
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,920
and he fell... he hit his head.

441
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,520
And he was... he went under
before we could get to him.

442
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,840
I heard you were asking.

443
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,480
So he drowned.

444
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,760
We already radioed Connecticut
with news of the accident.

445
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,840
You know, we really,
really got off

446
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,360
on the wrong foot, and I...

447
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,360
So j-just feel free to move
about the forward sections of...

448
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,720
Sorry, sir...
humidity builds up,

449
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,800
drips out the power bus.

450
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,560
I'll get right on it.

451
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,840
So... would you reconsider
England...

452
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,400
finding a port there?

453
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,520
I'm sorry.

454
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,880
Sorry for what?

455
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,800
Uh, she was...
asking about Winters.

456
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,960
What did you tell her?

457
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,720
The story.

458
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,800
Well, it's coming up
astern, but...

459
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,160
I don't know what that is.

460
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,760
Hooks!
They're using their hooks!

461
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,160
Mr. Loomis, what do we do?

462
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,560
What are your orders,
Mr. Brice?

463
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,720
Mr. Loomis,
the helm is waiting!

464
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,600
The men are waiting
for your orders, Mr. Brice!

465
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,360
Aah!

466
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,640
Get out! Get out!

467
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,320
Everybody, out!
Move it out!

468
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,640
Go! Go! Go!
Everybody, out!

469
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,400
...Come on!
...Get out!

470
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,000
Get out! Get out!

471
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,600
Get down there, Harry!
Move!

472
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,800
Get out.

473
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,200
O'Dell, make sure
everybody's out!

474
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,240
...Everybody's out, sir!
...Then close the goddamn hatch!

475
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,800
...Blow safety!
...Blow safety!

476
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,200
What heading, sir?!

477
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,560
Any goddamn heading!
Just get us out of here!

478
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,840
You'll do better
at the board of inquiry.

479
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,960
We're sloughing oil,
and it's bad.

480
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,400
I don't know exactly
where it is,

481
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,360
but it's somewhere between the
pressure hull and the sea hull.

482
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,920
And if it's leaking here
or here,

483
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,080
then it's dumping oil
under the main ballast,

484
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,160
which means that every time
we surface or dive...

485
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,720
We leave an oil slick.

486
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,880
Well, that's how...
that's how he's been riding us.

487
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,880
This boat "is" cursed.

488
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,520
Figure of speech.

489
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,440
So how do we fix it?

490
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,200
Well, there's only one way...
from the outside in.

491
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,440
They'll be lining up
for this job.

492
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,000
Okay, so let's make ready
some dive gear.

493
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,440
All right.

494
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,680
O'Dell, pick two volunteers...

495
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,000
Yes, sir.

496
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,640
...besides yourself.

497
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,240
You want someone
to free-dive outside with you

498
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,920
into the cold, black water,
make our way below the boat,

499
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,360
Iocate the floodboards,

500
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,120
and slither in between
the two hulls?

501
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,160
That's right.
Find the leak and fix it.

502
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,360
...At night.
...Hang on.

503
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,720
We're still submerged.

504
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,640
That means the main tanks are
full of water.

505
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,600
This is in the dark, Dell.

506
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,200
Yeah, well, chief thinks
that with the tower flooded,

507
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,640
it gives the boat enough weight
to stay down

508
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,800
while we blow some air
into the main tank.

509
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,360
Oh, well if that's
what the chief thinks.

510
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,520
So... you're gonna go out there.
You're gonna go outside.

511
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,640
Yes, that's right.

512
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,720
With all these... happenings
happening.

513
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,520
Look alive.

514
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,880
All right.

515
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,880
Who are the lucky bastards?

516
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,680
Fuck, no.

517
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,960
Set.

518
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,640
I asked him to go.
Buddy system.

519
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,360
...Ooh!
...Oh, shit!

520
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,440
You and me, O'Dell.
Forward.

521
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,880
You guys take aft.

522
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,960
Shit!

523
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,400
2330 hours.

524
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:07,080
To confirm sinking
of German ship,

525
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,480
four officers go topside...

526
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:13,840
Commander Winters, myself,
Lieutenant Loomis,

527
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,440
and Lieutenant
J. G. Stephen Coors.

528
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,280
The night we lost
Old Man Winters...

529
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,680
Odd time to bring that up.

530
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,840
It's an odd place.

531
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:32,360
So, how'd he bang his head
before he went over?

532
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:36,160
So, how'd he bang his head
before he went over?

533
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,320
You heard.

534
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,720
I heard that the boat
hit something,

535
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,760
but I never felt it down below.

536
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,640
What?!

537
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,240
I didn't say anything.

538
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,040
I know,
but what were you thinking?

539
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,880
Well...

540
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,800
I used to hear about
these dock workers.

541
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,520
They would get welded up
in these kind of places.

542
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:17,320
And then... they were
never heard from again.

543
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,760
Wally?

544
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,880
You are so fucking
out-of-bounds with that shit!

545
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,640
Let's keep moving.

546
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,800
Forward trim tank,
it looks like.

547
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,240
Better drive some wedges.

548
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,280
Yeah.

549
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,680
So anything I say...
stays here...

550
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,120
this side of the hull.

551
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,320
Yeah. Yeah.

552
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,240
There were survivors
from the sinking.

553
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,720
...Brice and Loomis even, uh...

554
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,960
even tried to fish a few out,

555
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,320
but... Winters had other ideas,

556
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,560
and, uh...

557
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,480
he ordered a gunnery party
topside.

558
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,080
Well, three of us had a problem

559
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,840
with machine-gunning
those men right in the water,

560
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,120
I mean,
even if they were German.

561
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,680
There was an argument.

562
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,680
It got kind of heated.

563
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,200
Well, why didn't you tell us?!

564
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,400
I guess, uh...

565
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,840
I guess we were trying
to protect him...

566
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,640
felt Winters was
a pretty good C. O.,

567
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,160
even if he could be a tough
son of a bitch sometimes.

568
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,840
For his reputation...
you know, his family's sake.

569
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,480
Yeah, yeah, okay, but...

570
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,360
I still don't see
how he hit his head.

571
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,360
Slippery metal.

572
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,760
Bad footing.

573
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,240
Accidents happen, right?

574
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,280
Where the hell did
that come from?!

575
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,400
Near or aft?

576
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,480
Crew, sound off!

577
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,000
Get them out of there!
Get them out!!

578
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,000
O'Dell!

579
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,720
Sound off, O'Dell!

580
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,880
...Oh!
...Sir!

581
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,000
Fuck, was that you?

582
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,960
The light!

583
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:22,720
We gotta get him out.

584
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,520
Come on, guys.

585
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,080
...How are we gonna...

586
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,160
Did you see that?

587
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,400
What happened, guys?! Come on!
What happened out there?!

588
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,240
...Talk to me.
...Don't touch me.

589
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,320
Did you fix it?

590
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,240
Which one of you boys
was screaming out there?

591
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,760
...Are we a man down?
...Don't touch me!

592
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,200
...Are we a man down?!
...Shut up!

593
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,160
Who was screaming?!

594
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,120
Come on, grow some dicks
and shut up!

595
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,920
Now, where is Mr. O...

596
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,200
Coors... where's Coors?

597
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,960
You tell me that's him.

598
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,520
That's gotta be Coors.
He's still alive, right?

599
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,080
Sir...

600
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,320
that is the one person
I can guarantee it's not.

601
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,200
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me!

602
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,440
...Don't! Don't!
...Hey, easy.

603
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,000
Easy, Stumbo.
Easy, easy.

604
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,960
...Easy, easy.
...Was that a "B"...

605
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,200
dash, dot, dot, dot?

606
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,480
I didn't hear a "B."

607
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,320
Dot, dash..."A"...
thought I heard an "A."

608
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,520
No, that's not morse.

609
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,840
It's just some shit
got caught up on the bow planes.

610
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,720
Now it's smacking up against...

611
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,040
"C"...you hear a "C"?

612
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,440
Dash, dot, dash, dot...
definitely a "C."

613
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,120
It's hull sounds.

614
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,840
You guys are getting lathered up
about hull sounds.

615
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,720
Now, would somebody please tell
us what happened to Mr. Coors?

616
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,680
"Back"...B-A-C-K.

617
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,440
He's back.

618
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,800
And where'd you get
the "K" from?

619
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,400
Dash, dot, dash...
while you were talking.

620
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,360
Hey, champ, you can stay
the hell out of this.

621
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,360
...And the rest of you...
...Enough, already, enough!

622
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,920
I n the wardroom, 5 minutes.

623
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,680
Keep your mouths shut
till we debrief.

624
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,320
Did you finish the job?

625
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,760
Yes, sir, absolutely.

626
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,480
Right, Wally? Wally?

627
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,400
Oh, yeah, I'm finished.

628
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,440
All right, so, look,
if the weather is good,

629
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,480
we surface tonight,
we recharge the batteries.

630
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,240
We pour on the diesel,
keep pushing for the barn.

631
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,320
Our barn?

632
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,320
Mr. Brice, southern English
port's gonna be

633
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,360
more than two days away.

634
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,960
Two days away, Mr. Brice!

635
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,000
Kingsley here is a navigational
officer. He knows the way.

636
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,600
I know all the ports,
the depths,

637
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,520
where the submarine nets are,
the mine fields.

638
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,200
Yeah, and have
the R. A. F. Bomb us

639
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,600
because they mistake us
for a hostile boat... okay.

640
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,400
There are safety corridors
that we can use...

641
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,120
Considered and rejected,
thank you.

642
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,280
Mr. Brice, both our periscopes
are down, our sonar is gone.

643
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,400
We are blind and nearly deaf.

644
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,360
Our men are in a bad way,

645
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,120
and now we've lost
two of our senior officers.

646
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,680
Welcome to the war, O'Dell.

647
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,480
This has nothing to do
with the war.

648
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,800
Just how much longer
can we not say

649
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,280
what we're all thinking?

650
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,680
No one wants to be the first?

651
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,640
Fine. Allow me.

652
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,360
This submarine is haun...

653
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,920
When I want your opinion,
Miss Page, I'll give it to you.

654
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,800
I am not one of your men that
you can just dismiss, Mr. Brice!

655
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,640
I don't believe
we're alone down here,

656
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,080
and I know some of you think
the same way.

657
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,640
Unless we find
a safe harbor soon,

658
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,680
we're all going to end up like
your friend Mr. Coors.

659
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,920
The loss of Lieutenant Coors
is unfortunate.

660
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,440
It fails to affect our plans.

661
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,600
Attention all hands...
it's daylight now.

662
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,880
I expect to surface... at 1900,

663
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,440
recharge the batteries,

664
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,840
and proceed on base course
back to Connecticut.

665
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:08,800
...That is all.

666
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,000
You're 10 seconds away
from finding out

667
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,760
what the penalty is
for mutiny at sea,

668
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,520
'cause that's how long
it's gonna take me

669
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,880
to open the armory
and reload that sidearm.

670
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,800
Now, do either of you
care to say anything else

671
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,400
that might further agitate
this crew or me?

672
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,960
Mr. O'Dell?

673
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,600
Yeah, I didn't think so.

674
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,720
We just knock the nose around
a little bit,

675
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:01,560
we're back on base,
so make it 2-8-5.

676
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,680
Make it 2-8-5 true.

677
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,200
2-8-5 true, sir.

678
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,680
Heading home, boys.
Sound good?

679
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,480
...Yes, sir.
...Sounds good, sir.

680
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,360
Hey, you're oversteering.
Mind your rudder.

681
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,800
She's getting
some resistance, sir.

682
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:49,840
Chief of boat to control.
Chief of boat to control room.

683
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,040
All right, belay that.
Belay that.

684
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,200
I said belay that!

685
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:05,840
...Oh!
...Oh!

686
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,360
Rudder at midship, sir.

687
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:31,520
Um, some...
kind of hydraulic failure.

688
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,120
Oh, Christ.

689
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,640
Must have overshot
our heading by...

690
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,680
170 degrees.

691
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:55,400
Oh, good. A gun.
Yeah, I needed a gun.

692
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,480
I'll put that
with the prizes.

693
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:01,960
Okay, I got feathers, crosses,
and strip-show icons...

694
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,560
Rudder malfunction.

695
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,680
When we tried to shut down
the props, no dice.

696
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,240
Wouldn't respond.

697
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,320
We're on a runaway boat,
fellas.

698
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,120
Now, can any of you top that?

699
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,840
Well...
I had a strange thought.

700
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,960
Take a number.

701
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,880
Yeah, but this one's
real creep-show stuff.

702
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:31,360
What if, when we took on
that kraut ship...

703
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,000
...we didn't sink 'em?

704
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:39,040
What if... they sank us?

705
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,880
Oh, that's a good twist.

706
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,800
I don't get it.

707
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:48,320
Might explain how that
dead kraut talked to Stumbo.

708
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,320
I don't get it.

709
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,240
And the controls...
that they froze up.

710
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,680
No, they... they rusted up.

711
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,200
That's because we're at the...
the bottom of the ocean.

712
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,160
Flooded out.

713
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,240
Of course, I'm not sure what all
that pounding was about.

714
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:03,400
Those are rescue divers...
pounding on the hull.

715
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,720
Only it's too late.

716
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,440
Shit, I get it.

717
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:06,600
Hydrogen from the batteries...

718
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,800
Hydrogen from the batteries...

719
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:13,320
CO2, ozone
from the electrical shorts...

720
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,080
that's what we're breathing
right now.

721
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,960
Like those deep-sea divers
that don't get enough oxygen...

722
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,480
head starts playing tricks
on 'em.

723
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:23,720
We got mechanical problems,
that's all, okay?

724
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,640
We always got
mechanical problems.

725
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,680
Now, please...

726
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,320
will you pinch this shit off?

727
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,480
...Unless...
...Oh...

728
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,400
It happened
during the depth charging.

729
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,800
Remember that one?

730
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,200
Rolled right down our deck.

731
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:50,040
So exactly how far
from England are we?

732
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,240
Can I ask why you're asking?

733
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,680
No.

734
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,640
Right.

735
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,640
Uh, what's our heading?

736
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,280
0-9-5.

737
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:01,400
Right. Uh...

738
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,400
May I ask why you're asking?

739
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:08,920
Just in case the boat
can't make it back home...

740
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,840
for whatever reason.

741
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,400
What do you suggest
we do about it, chief?

742
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,320
Come on.
Enough of the guessing games.

743
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,240
...Pressure blinding the shafts.
...No, I don't think that's it.

744
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,680
Just lay it out for us, chief.

745
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,120
What about the I. M. O. Pumps?

746
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,880
I. M. O. Pumps check out.
I don't think it's that either.

747
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,680
The rudder has a dedicated line
from here to the stern.

748
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,720
If we tap into there
somewhere aft,

749
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,280
I think we should regain
our steering.

750
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,560
But where are you gonna tap in?

751
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,000
That's the thing.

752
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,720
The line goes right through
the battery room.

753
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,880
That's a little dicey, isn't it,
without venting first?

754
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,360
Just threading up
new hydraulics, no welding.

755
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,960
Well, where are we at, anyway?

756
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:46,920
13 percent down.

757
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,480
...13 percent hydrogen?
...Keep your voice down.

758
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:53,960
Look, I don't know any other
way to regain control...

759
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,640
Fuck if I know.

760
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,520
All right, but you gotta
make sure you're sealed off,

761
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,920
'cause we don't want a repeat
of the "Hindenburg" here.

762
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,440
Let's keep this quiet.

763
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,720
As if it's a bloody
mechanical problem.

764
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,520
Fore door sealed.

765
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,880
After door sealed.

766
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,440
What's happened here, hmm?

767
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,120
What is this?

768
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,240
Go to the galley.
Get a cup of coffee.

769
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,960
Oh, no, I'm fine, sir.
Really.

770
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,720
You're falling asleep, champ.

771
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,920
...I'll watch your bubble.
...Yes, sir.

772
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:45,160
Lieutenant, a word?

773
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,400
Lieutenant, a word?

774
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,920
...Not now.
...No, Mr. Loomis.

775
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,240
We need to speak right now.

776
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,080
That is a whale, right?

777
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,960
What else would it be?

778
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,280
Come on.

779
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,720
Let's get that rudder working.

780
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,480
Now, maybe this is
just a coincidence.

781
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,440
I know Lieutenant Coors
wasn't too sure

782
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,120
about the last star fix.

783
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,720
But it sure seems like
we're going

784
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:24,160
right back to where
we sunk that German ship.

785
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,360
Clear the compartment.

786
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,720
Everybody, give us 5 minutes.

787
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:29,920
Go!

788
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,000
All right.
We're almost all set.

789
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,920
Just repressurizing the line,

790
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,240
see if we can't put the brakes
on this little joyride.

791
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,600
I'll reset the bus.

792
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,000
Shit!

793
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,280
Hey, guys,
we lost power up here.

794
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,440
Shut that goddamn door

795
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:07,600
before I shut it
with your goddamn face!

796
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,040
What are you saying, O'Dell?

797
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,480
It's not a coincidence?

798
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,680
Somebody put us on this course?

799
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,600
I'm just asking a question.

800
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,360
Let me ask one.

801
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,440
Where were "you"
when the rudder went over?

802
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,040
Huh?

803
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:27,720
This course heads back
to England,

804
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,440
and I've noticed you've had
a hard-on for anything English.

805
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:31,720
So where were you, O'Dell?

806
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,760
Back of the boat... messing with
the rudder assembly?

807
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:34,920
Or did you get some motormac...

808
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,680
That is the craziest thing
I have ever heard!

809
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,240
Not as crazy
as what you're saying!

810
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,520
I'm tired
of this hoodoo horseshit!

811
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,280
It is "not"
what you think it is!

812
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,880
It is not even remotely
"fucking" possible!

813
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,600
Okay?!

814
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,960
After room,
get the chief to pick up.

815
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,320
Hoag!

816
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,440
Maneuvering room, respond.

817
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,040
Anybody, contact control.

818
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:59,640
...Mr. Loomis, where's our crew?

819
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,240
It's warm.

820
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:43,880
Loomis...

821
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,440
I-I, um...

822
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,200
Go ahead.

823
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,360
I'm gonna change up my scrub.

824
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:54,280
Keep looking.
Gotta be somebody.

825
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,800
All right.
All right, chief.

826
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,560
...We found you.
...Don't...

827
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,160
Can you feel anything...

828
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,640
your legs, your toes,
anything at all?

829
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,600
...Don't...
...Come on.

830
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:02,800
try to stop me.

831
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,240
You're gonna pull through.

832
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,160
Especially...

833
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,200
...you.

834
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,040
Time to go.
Battery's still working.

835
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,120
What happened?

836
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,600
What happened?

837
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,960
Sparks... the hydrogen.

838
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,680
Everybody... everybody's...

839
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:37,960
Loomis...

840
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,920
Loomis?

841
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,120
...Sir! Sir!
...Get out of my way!

842
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,320
...Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
...Get the fuck off me!

843
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,120
Loomis!

844
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,320
...Loom...

845
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:25,920
He's here.

846
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:07,920
Did he even have...

847
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,920
air?

848
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,080
Not a bloody foot.

849
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:49,520
Come on, Stumbo.
Keep trying.

850
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,200
We gotta release that air.
Come on. One more.

851
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,640
Come on, Stumbo.

852
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:57,400
It's like it's welded.

853
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:02,040
All I know is what Coors
told me.

854
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,640
And apparently...

855
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:07,960
Captain Winters wanted to shoot
the German survivors.

856
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:09,880
Mr. Brice and Mr. Loomis

857
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:14,520
and Mr.... Mr. Coors...
wanted to help.

858
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:17,360
Apparently Captain Winters
lost the argument.

859
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,840
Well, that's interesting.

860
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:26,200
But it's not what I heard...
from Mr. Brice.

861
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,280
Lieutenant?

862
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:34,000
Are you sure he came back here?

863
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,440
Looking for me?

864
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,640
I, uh...

865
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:44,120
Just... reporting, sir,
that the heating is down.

866
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,400
And, uh...
the bow's levers are stuck.

867
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,160
Stumbo's working on it
right now.

868
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,920
And that we show
90 pounds of compressed air

869
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,280
still left in the system,
and I... wasn't sure

870
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,080
if you wanted to use that
when we tried to surface

871
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,000
or use it now
so we can breathe.

872
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,840
Shinola.

873
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:03,360
Sir?

874
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,480
Running out of shinola, too.

875
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:16,040
We also wanted to ask you
about Captain Winters...

876
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,440
whether there was anything
you could tell us

877
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:19,960
about what happened that night

878
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:21,720
that might help us
to understand...

879
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:25,000
Don't pretend you don't know.

880
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,520
Just don't pretend anymore.

881
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:35,400
Well, wasn't that awkward?

882
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:39,240
Maybe Hoag was right.
Maybe we already bought it.

883
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:44,400
If not the depth charge,
then... the hydrogen.

884
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,280
If not the hydrogen, then...

885
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,200
maybe the cold.

886
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,360
And if not that,

887
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,560
then we got a big evil spirit
batting cleanup.

888
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,120
...Jesus Christ.
...Come on, Stumbo.

889
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:58,120
There should only be
so many ways a guy can die.

890
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,160
Listen to me.
CO2 hangs low.

891
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:02,960
It starts from the floor up,
and I need you right now...

892
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,560
...No, no.
...to get up on your feet.

893
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,560
...Maybe I just need to...
...Stumbo. Stumbo!

894
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,840
...Let me try.
...We already bought it.

895
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,320
Come on, Stumbo. Head up.

896
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,240
...Over and over...
...I need you to sit up.

897
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,120
...over and over again.
...Look at me.

898
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,640
Now look at me.
Look at me.

899
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,240
...Good.

900
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,280
Feel that?

901
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,120
Well, you're alive, then,
aren't you?

902
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:23,600
You fuckin'...

903
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:25,560
...Stumbo...
...Whoa, hey, hey, hey! Hey!

904
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:28,000
...Take it easy! Hey!
...Relax, man!

905
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,800
Stumbo!

906
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,680
Isn't there a winch or a pulley

907
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,720
or maybe a come-along
in a bowsman's locker?

908
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:35,840
...Yeah.
...Can't we use that?

909
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,320
You know what he's
talking about, Stumbo?

910
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:38,720
...Yeah.
...Well, come on.

911
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:41,160
Come... we need it. Come on.
Show... show me, Stumbo.

912
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,240
We've got to get it.
Okay, come on. Come on.

913
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,920
So, tell me
why three officers

914
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,840
would conspire to kill
their captain

915
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,120
and cover it up.

916
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,240
That's what you're thinking,
isn't it?

917
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:57,840
What if I am?

918
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:00,000
I can see I'm not the only one.

919
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,960
Loomis was up
for a major citation.

920
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,920
And Brice was ready
for his own command.

921
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,240
He was from a naval family.
He went to Annapolis.

922
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,680
Coors had this beautiful girl
waiting for him back in Boston

923
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:13,440
that he was always
talking about, Claire.

924
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:15,880
These guys had everything
to live for.

925
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:20,280
By that reasoning...
they had everything to lose.

926
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:28,240
Are we missing somebody?

927
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:45,600
Wallace...

928
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:49,000
Wallace?

929
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:51,440
...No!

930
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:52,960
...No! No!
...Shh!

931
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,320
...No-o-o!
...It's just us.

932
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,320
It's just... us.

933
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,880
...Now, listen...

934
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:02,360
We're running out of plays
in the playbook.

935
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:05,080
Do you have... any idea
why the boat is going back

936
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,880
or how we can get control
of it?

937
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:11,160
I've been checking the
literature on this subject.

938
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:13,400
And the thing we know
about maledictions is...

939
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:14,520
Maledictions?

940
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:15,680
Look it up.

941
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,920
Maledictions don't issue
from Heaven or Hell

942
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:20,360
but from some unresolved place
in between.

943
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,000
I n fact, there's a great...

944
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,240
Wallace...
we're running out of air.

945
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:29,040
Suffice to say...

946
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:33,440
the malediction needs
satisfaction

947
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:36,200
in order to escape
its netherworld.

948
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,920
And if you had to guess...

949
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:42,400
what would satisfy
our malediction?

950
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,440
Old Man Winters never
got a chance

951
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,920
to go down with the ship,
did he?

952
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,040
Wallace, leave yours here.

953
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,120
We gotta dig up
some more light.

954
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,480
Okay, listen, uh...

955
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:03,720
Just... Just promise me
you'll stay on your feet, okay?

956
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,480
"Don't pretend..."

957
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:23,960
"Don't pretend
you don't... know. "

958
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,880
2230 hours: Sight target

959
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:40,560
believed to be
German sub tender.

960
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:43,200
Winters orders flank speed
to close target

961
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,160
and gain a firing angle.

962
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:48,240
2315: Loomis checks
target profile against I. D. Iog,

963
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:52,160
matching it to target, and
I personally verify the match.

964
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:57,480
2320: Single torpedo fired
from number-4 tube.

965
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:03,920
Heard the strike, followed by
collapsing bulkheads.

966
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,280
2330 hours: To confirm sinking
of German ship,

967
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:09,280
four officers go topside...

968
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,320
Commander Winters,
myself, Lieutenant Loomis,

969
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,480
and Lieutenant
J. G. Stephen Coors.

970
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,720
"Many bodies in the water. "

971
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,960
"Ship burning on the horizon. "

972
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:17,000
What are you doing in here?

973
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:19,840
Go.

974
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,040
A German ship...

975
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,360
of the type
Brice said you sunk.

976
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:33,440
My ship...
the Fort James hospital ship.

977
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:36,000
So what you're saying is...

978
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:39,360
that the submarine
Kingsley saw...

979
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,920
the one
he thought was German...

980
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,280
Wasn't.

981
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,400
So it was an accident?

982
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:50,080
Not when he left us
in the water to die.

983
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:53,160
Not when he heard the cries
for help in English.

984
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:54,120
You actually believe

985
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,240
that Captain Winters would
just leave...

986
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,720
Help! Help me!

987
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,320
No.

988
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:03,880
Captain Winters wanted to
pick up the survivors.

989
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:05,800
That means...

990
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,040
Help!

991
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,440
Who mis-I. D. 'd the ship?

992
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:18,160
Who had everything to lose?

993
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:39,880
Either the battery has
finally crapped out, or...

994
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,600
Or maybe we're here.

995
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,000
Come on.
Let's get some air going.

996
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:55,400
...All right.

997
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:57,200
Come on, everybody, pull!
Come on!

998
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,880
Come on! Pull!

999
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,280
Fuck me. This is it.

1000
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,560
...Oh!
...God, I hate being right.

1001
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,360
...Pull!

1002
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:38,440
Kingsley.

1003
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:41,680
Oh, Jesus, God,
we're going down.

1004
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:49,400
It's going up.

1005
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:50,480
It's going up!

1006
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,840
...Okay. All right.

1007
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:49,360
Wallace, see if you can work the
radar, get a sweep of the area.

1008
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,680
Stumbo, see if you can crack
this hatch. Use a crowbar.

1009
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,640
Drain the tower.
See if we can get out that way.

1010
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:55,360
If not, we gotta go out
the forward...

1011
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,280
Oh, God.

1012
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,440
Hey, fellas...
we have contact.

1013
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:17,480
On SJ radar...
4, 000 yards, starboard beam.

1014
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,880
It's the same one?
It's the same kraut ship?

1015
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:25,440
...Are we being choosy?
...All right.

1016
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:27,040
Uh, Wallace, raise the antenna.

1017
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:28,760
Issue a radio challenge
on the Ariel-6.

1018
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,200
Get the ship I. D. 'd
as of right now.

1019
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:31,840
Well done, Mr. O'Dell.

1020
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,800
But I'm feeling
much better now.

1021
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:56,040
You were saying?

1022
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:57,720
We have a contact.

1023
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,720
That may be an opportunity.

1024
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,600
An opportunity?

1025
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:04,960
To abandon ship.

1026
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,760
Well, I don't know that
that's a friendly out there.

1027
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:08,880
Well, neither do I.

1028
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:11,040
But it seems better to scuttle
now and take our chances

1029
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,880
with a surface vessel,
even if it is German.

1030
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,560
Scuttle and tell Connecticut
what?

1031
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:17,000
We sunk one of their
finest fleet submarines

1032
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:19,040
because we lost a few men
carrying out our mission?

1033
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,680
A few men, sir?

1034
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:26,080
Contact at 2,500 yards.

1035
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:27,360
Might cross the stern.

1036
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:29,640
We'll wait... right here.

1037
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:35,920
Wallace... no matter what
Mr. Brice says,

1038
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,600
I want you to go
to the radio shack

1039
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:40,200
and establish a voice contact
with that ship immediately.

1040
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:41,600
You are not the skipper
of this ship, Mr. O'Dell!

1041
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:43,520
And neither are you, sir!

1042
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:12,400
Rain squall.

1043
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,960
With a little luck, they
won't see us in all this...

1044
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,080
...weather.

1045
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:47,920
Here!

1046
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,840
Please!

1047
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,440
We're over here!

1048
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:54,320
Please!

1049
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,400
Help, please!

1050
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,000
Help!

1051
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:00,200
On your starboard side!

1052
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,640
It's really not safe up here,
Miss Page.

1053
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:16,240
We're going below now!

1054
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,680
Aah!

1055
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,520
Bury everybody
and bury the truth...

1056
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,040
is that it, Brice?!

1057
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:31,400
Like this.

1058
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:33,680
This is how I go.

1059
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:38,040
If that's your plan...

1060
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:40,760
get on with it,
you fucking coward!

1061
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,120
Stumbo, man the ports.
Get ready to scuttle this boat!

1062
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:53,960
Just leave!

1063
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:55,800
They'll blame it on a U-boat!

1064
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:00,040
Just get out of here!
They'll never fuckin' know!

1065
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:01,800
Any more advice for me, champ?

1066
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:16,440
500 yards and closing!

1067
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,480
Looks like we're definitely
gonna lose some paint

1068
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:19,600
on this one, sir!

1069
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:22,640
I kept looking for some way
just...

1070
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:25,800
just to... take it back,

1071
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:27,880
to make it end right...

1072
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:31,160
some way without
dishonoring Winters.

1073
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:38,560
I was gonna wear this uniform
back to port.

1074
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:41,760
Now...

1075
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:49,440
What should I do, Miss Page?

1076
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:52,720
You give me the light
so that I can signal for help.

1077
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,080
I don't...

1078
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:57,840
God, I don't know!

1079
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:35,920
I just figured out
why he didn't kill me, too.

1080
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:38,320
He didn't have to.

1081
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:59,960
Aah!

1082
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:25,000
Hey! Over here!

1083
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:26,640
Come back!

1084
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:29,400
Come back.

1085
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:37,240
Well, you weren't the first
woman that ever slapped me,

1086
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:39,320
and you won't be the last.

1087
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:42,320
But that was a good thing
you done for me back there.

1088
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,440
Well done, Miss Page.

1089
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:51,120
Well done, Mr. Stumbo.

1090
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,720
Dead but not buried, I see.

1091
01:32:58,720 --> 01:32:59,640
Pardon me?

1092
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:01,320
Your vessel.

1093
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:35,440
So, what would you say
if you had to explain it all?

1094
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:39,040
Does seem rather unlikely now,
doesn't it?

1095
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:44,160
Have you thought that...

1096
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,080
that maybe
when Captain Winters died,

1097
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:49,760
he just... died, and that was it?

1098
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:51,680
And the rest...

1099
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:55,080
And the rest...

1100
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:57,800
I don't know.

1101
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:03,680
You say whatever
you have to say, ensign.

1102
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:08,560
I'll always believe we were
brought back here for a reason.
