00:01:39,237 --> 00:01:42,102
[heavy breathing]

2
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:48,591
[laughter]

3
00:01:52,698 --> 00:01:55,563
MAN: Keep your eyes on the road.

4
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:57,772
WOMAN: [inaudible]

5
00:01:57,876 --> 00:01:58,566
MAN: Oh.

6
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,086
WOMAN: Oh.

7
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,052
MAN: Hey, yes.

8
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:10,544
WOMAN: [panting]

9
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,412
REPORTER [RADIO]:
And the city board

10
00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:19,242
says another girl has been found
dead in the Hollywood Hills.

11
00:02:19,346 --> 00:02:21,796
The girl, the second
in only one week,

12
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,110
has been identified as a student
from Holy Trinity College.

13
00:02:25,214 --> 00:02:27,388
No other information
has been released.

14
00:02:27,492 --> 00:02:29,079
The police still
have no leads and are

15
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:31,047
advising all women to
take extra precautions

16
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,600
until the killer is found.

17
00:02:32,704 --> 00:02:33,843
WOMAN: [laughing]

18
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,293
REPORTER [RADIO]: In
other news, astronomers

19
00:02:35,396 --> 00:02:37,536
all over the world eagerly
await the full lunar

20
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,883
eclipse, the first in 66 years.

21
00:02:39,987 --> 00:02:41,851
The last eclipse
occurred in 1928.

22
00:03:40,944 --> 00:03:43,809
[sirens]

23
00:03:47,986 --> 00:03:49,436
Jesus Christ, Garner.

24
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:51,714
If you're sick, go
to the hospital.

25
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:53,198
It's that damn Mexican food.

26
00:03:53,302 --> 00:03:54,441
I can't do anything about it.

27
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:58,238
Oh, man.

28
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:11,699
I need a drink Here.

29
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:17,533
We got a cause of death?

30
00:04:17,636 --> 00:04:19,500
No.

31
00:04:19,604 --> 00:04:23,401
They can't figure it out.

32
00:04:23,504 --> 00:04:25,748
Oh yeah, she's warm.

33
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:29,096
Like a doughnut straight
out of the oven, huh?

34
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,097
Jesus Garner.

35
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,340
Hey, we can still
smell the perfume.

36
00:04:31,443 --> 00:04:33,480
Do we have an ID?

37
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,896
Her name's Peggy Malone.

38
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:37,829
Age, 27.

39
00:04:37,932 --> 00:04:40,556
Says she's got blue eyes.

40
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:42,247
Not a bad looker, huh?

41
00:04:42,351 --> 00:04:43,697
Jesus Christ, Gardner.

42
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,561
The poor girl is
dead and you think

43
00:04:45,664 --> 00:04:47,839
she's worth a roll in the hay.

44
00:04:47,942 --> 00:04:49,185
You're fucking
disgusting, you know that?

45
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:54,328
Oh shit.

46
00:04:54,432 --> 00:04:55,812
I don't need this.

47
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,165
GARNER: Hey, captain.

48
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:05,166
How you doing?

49
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:10,586
Looks like she's in a trance.

50
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:12,104
Just like the other two, sir.

51
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,174
No signs of penetration.

52
00:05:13,278 --> 00:05:14,348
No visible wounds.

53
00:05:14,452 --> 00:05:16,557
Coroner says she's
been embalmed.

54
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:19,111
This all you two
morons can figure out?

55
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:24,738
Jesus Christ.

56
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:29,674
This makes number three, Lutz.

57
00:05:29,777 --> 00:05:31,331
If there's a number four, you're
going to be picking your dick

58
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:32,470
while you're directing traffic.

59
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:34,057
So you better get your
head out of your fat ass

60
00:05:34,161 --> 00:05:35,645
and solve this case.

61
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:38,890
It's a goddamn miracle the press
hasn't gone public with this.

62
00:05:38,993 --> 00:05:41,582
And you-- wipe that shit
eating grin of your face.

63
00:05:41,686 --> 00:05:43,101
Captain, we are
making progress.

64
00:05:43,204 --> 00:05:45,103
We're pursuing numerous
leads and we believe that--

65
00:05:45,206 --> 00:05:45,897
Leads?

66
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,174
Arrest somebody.

67
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:48,762
Don't give me this
Marianne shit about,

68
00:05:48,865 --> 00:05:50,142
we've got numerous leads.

69
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:52,006
Jesus, I can turn
on the television

70
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,249
and hear that bullshit.

71
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,355
I wouldn't want to be a
woman in this town with cops

72
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,840
like you jerking off dropping
doughnuts into your fat traps

73
00:05:57,943 --> 00:05:59,945
and doubling for an episode
of "Laverne and Shirley"

74
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:01,499
while some Psycho
Sid son of a bitch

75
00:06:01,602 --> 00:06:03,501
is out there playing Russian
Roulette with my mortality.

76
00:06:07,263 --> 00:06:09,679
If I get woken up in
the middle of the night

77
00:06:09,783 --> 00:06:13,683
with another one of these
calls, you are off the case.

78
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,590
I don't get it.

79
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:24,729
What?

80
00:06:24,832 --> 00:06:26,489
"Laverne and Shirley"
was not a bad show.

81
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,323
Shut up, Garner.

82
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:38,259
Just shut up.

83
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:40,434
Hey, you all right, man?

84
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,216
Can I get yo anything else?

85
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,461
What do you have in mind?

86
00:07:07,565 --> 00:07:13,294
That'll be $1.68.

87
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:16,746
Keep the change.

88
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,715
When was the last time
you saw an optometrist.

89
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:20,716
I don't see [inaudible]

90
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:21,855
[inaudible] talking to you man.

91
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:22,649
Hold up.

92
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:50,297
I really like Country-Western.

93
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,644
How about you?

94
00:07:52,748 --> 00:07:55,198
Me too.

95
00:07:55,302 --> 00:07:58,029
Can I buy you a
shake or something?

96
00:07:58,132 --> 00:08:00,825
No thanks, I'm
waiting for someone.

97
00:08:00,928 --> 00:08:02,758
Hm, lucky someone.

98
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,244
My name's Jonathan.

99
00:08:06,347 --> 00:08:07,038
What's others?

100
00:08:07,141 --> 00:08:08,522
Mary.

101
00:08:08,626 --> 00:08:11,456
Like the virgin.

102
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,457
Excuse me.

103
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:22,950
This is starting to
give me a headache.

104
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:28,404
Nada.

105
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,857
Four weeks of this and
nothing to show for it.

106
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,030
Betty?

107
00:08:34,134 --> 00:08:34,824
What?

108
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,313
Where are those new files
on cause of death unknown?

109
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:42,660
Right here.

110
00:08:42,763 --> 00:08:46,180
Put them on my desk, will you?

111
00:08:46,284 --> 00:08:49,011
Anything else I
can get for you?

112
00:08:49,114 --> 00:08:49,874
Anymore doughnuts?

113
00:08:49,977 --> 00:08:51,151
It's going to be a long night.

114
00:08:51,254 --> 00:08:52,462
What am I, your secretary?

115
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:53,256
Thanks, hun.

116
00:08:58,986 --> 00:09:00,160
Garner.

117
00:09:00,263 --> 00:09:03,163
Look at this, from
San Francisco.

118
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:06,718
Victim found with
no visible wounds.

119
00:09:06,822 --> 00:09:09,756
Cause of death unknown,
time of death unknown.

120
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:12,310
Body found embalmed,
only a small gold cross

121
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:13,622
found around her neck.

122
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:14,899
We got a link here.

123
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:15,727
Betty.

124
00:09:15,831 --> 00:09:16,866
BETTY: What?

125
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,558
Give this cop from
San Francisco a call.

126
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:19,351
Mmm.

127
00:09:19,455 --> 00:09:20,974
We got a link here.

128
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:22,354
Well, it's about time.

129
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,321
Oh, and Betty.

130
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:24,736
What?

131
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,773
I think you should stop wearing
that cross around your neck.

132
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:27,636
It was my grandmother's.

133
00:09:27,739 --> 00:09:28,809
I never take it off.

134
00:09:28,913 --> 00:09:30,224
Hey, just looking out for you.

135
00:09:30,328 --> 00:09:32,157
I don't want to be sitting
here looking at your picture

136
00:09:32,261 --> 00:09:32,951
next week.

137
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:37,887
Wonder what that
looks like, huh?

138
00:09:56,216 --> 00:09:58,425
Your date isn't very punctual.

139
00:09:58,528 --> 00:10:00,772
He must have forgot.

140
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:03,603
How could someone
forget a girl like you?

141
00:10:03,706 --> 00:10:06,364
I would never forget
a girl like you.

142
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:07,330
You wouldn't?

143
00:10:07,434 --> 00:10:08,124
No.

144
00:10:10,817 --> 00:10:13,820
I feel like a drink.

145
00:10:13,923 --> 00:10:16,305
What do you say?

146
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,065
I have a drink.

147
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:20,896
No, no, I mean a
real drink-- something

148
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:22,725
with a little more kick to it.

149
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,661
Have you ever had
a screaming orgasm?

150
00:10:27,765 --> 00:10:29,283
What?

151
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:32,217
Well, it's a drink.

152
00:10:32,321 --> 00:10:34,841
Oh, I don't think alcohol.

153
00:10:34,944 --> 00:10:36,152
Who said it was a drink?

154
00:10:42,262 --> 00:10:44,091
Christ, if It's not some
psycho that kills me,

155
00:10:44,195 --> 00:10:45,817
it'll be your cigarette smoke.

156
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:48,648
Hey, I'm under a lot of
pressure here, all right?

157
00:10:52,548 --> 00:10:54,377
Let's put out an APB.

158
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:55,171
An APB?

159
00:10:55,275 --> 00:10:56,897
Hm.

160
00:10:57,001 --> 00:10:58,485
On who?

161
00:10:58,588 --> 00:11:00,245
Well, we have that description
from that witness, no?

162
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:12,223
You call this sorry piece
of shit a description?

163
00:11:12,326 --> 00:11:16,537
Six foot, muscular, cute ass?

164
00:11:16,641 --> 00:11:17,987
That's half the
guys in this city.

165
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:19,333
All right, well, we
have to do something

166
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:20,645
to please the captain.

167
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:23,683
Yeah, and blowing smoke
up our asses ain't it.

168
00:11:23,786 --> 00:11:25,581
Some woman out there's going
to be this guy's next victim.

169
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,239
And what are we doing about it?

170
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:29,240
Sorry.

171
00:11:29,343 --> 00:11:30,034
Ow!

172
00:11:30,137 --> 00:11:30,828
Sorry.

173
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:36,488
I owe you one.

174
00:11:56,405 --> 00:11:58,856
Well, thanks for
walking me home.

175
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,616
Sure.

176
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,238
You live here alone?

177
00:12:02,342 --> 00:12:03,619
Mm-hm.

178
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,105
Must get kind of scary
living here by yourself.

179
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:11,489
Or at least lonely.

180
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:13,146
Do you want to come in?

181
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:13,940
Yeah.

182
00:12:31,474 --> 00:12:32,821
Why so nervous?

183
00:12:32,924 --> 00:12:33,925
Uh, look, Mister.

184
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:35,651
What did you say your name was?

185
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,239
Jonathan.

186
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:40,276
Jonathan, I hardly know you.

187
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,622
OK.

188
00:12:41,726 --> 00:12:44,315
You're right, I'm sorry.

189
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:48,146
I just find myself
very attracted to you.

190
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,287
Your beauty and your charm.

191
00:12:51,391 --> 00:12:53,600
How sweet.

192
00:12:53,703 --> 00:12:55,326
Can I get you
something to drink?

193
00:12:55,429 --> 00:12:56,120
Coffee?

194
00:12:56,223 --> 00:12:57,259
Tea?

195
00:12:57,362 --> 00:12:58,501
Maybe something cold.

196
00:12:58,605 --> 00:13:00,849
Cool me off.

197
00:13:00,952 --> 00:13:01,642
OK.

198
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:11,169
OK, there's cranberry
juice, ginger ale,

199
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:12,515
chocolate milk, tomato juice?

200
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:14,483
You have a beer?

201
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:15,380
No.

202
00:13:15,484 --> 00:13:16,968
Of course you don't.

203
00:13:23,112 --> 00:13:24,355
I'll have tomato juice.

204
00:13:31,914 --> 00:13:33,778
Pretend it's a Bloody Mary.

205
00:14:09,503 --> 00:14:10,194
WOMAN: [moan]

206
00:14:10,297 --> 00:14:12,713
MARY: [moan]

207
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:14,888
Jesus, Garner.

208
00:14:14,992 --> 00:14:17,718
Which side are you on?

209
00:14:17,822 --> 00:14:21,653
Man, you're like a
bull in a china shop.

210
00:14:29,696 --> 00:14:33,079
Look at this.

211
00:14:33,182 --> 00:14:36,530
I think you found
something, boy-o.

212
00:14:36,634 --> 00:14:39,257
And everybody thinks
you're stupid.

213
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:40,051
Betty!

214
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:52,270
MARY: [moan]

215
00:14:52,374 --> 00:14:53,409
What?

216
00:14:53,513 --> 00:14:54,721
LUTZ: Go down to the
morgue Tell the coroner

217
00:14:54,824 --> 00:14:56,516
we need tight
shots on every inch

218
00:14:56,619 --> 00:14:58,621
of Peggy Malone's body, ASAP.

219
00:14:58,725 --> 00:14:59,450
The morgue?

220
00:14:59,553 --> 00:15:00,382
Go down to the newsstand.

221
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:02,246
They got pictures of live ones.

222
00:15:02,349 --> 00:15:04,489
Hey, and pick us up
some doughnuts on the way

223
00:15:04,593 --> 00:15:06,181
back-- fresh ones, huh?

224
00:15:06,284 --> 00:15:07,182
Oh, if you have time.

225
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:08,804
You are both disgusting pigs.

226
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,495
You know that.

227
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:12,014
Just doing our jobs.

228
00:15:12,118 --> 00:15:13,913
Well, you don't have
to enjoy it so much.

229
00:15:25,614 --> 00:15:27,961
We got ourselves a
genuine psycho here.

230
00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:28,928
Jesus.

231
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:30,343
Ritual killings, man.

232
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,085
I think we need some
professional help on this one.

233
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:49,327
Well, it works for me, man.

234
00:15:49,431 --> 00:15:50,777
I'm open to anything
at this point.

235
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,611
Betty, come here.

236
00:15:57,715 --> 00:15:59,096
Yeah.

237
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,856
You ever get a hold of
that cop in San Francisco.

238
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,651
No, but somebody else did.

239
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:03,617
What do you mean?

240
00:16:03,721 --> 00:16:04,653
Killed.

241
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,172
Murdered.

242
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:07,552
Jesus.

243
00:16:07,656 --> 00:16:08,691
Yeah.

244
00:16:08,795 --> 00:16:12,281
Look, we need files
on every single expert

245
00:16:12,385 --> 00:16:14,628
in the occult who's ever
stepped foot in this place.

246
00:16:14,732 --> 00:16:16,492
That's a lot of files.

247
00:16:16,596 --> 00:16:20,738
Then you better get on it ASAP.

248
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:23,775
Whatever happened to good
old fashioned murder, huh?

249
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:26,571
This supernatural mumbo
jumbo gives me the creeps.

250
00:16:26,675 --> 00:16:27,814
Really.

251
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:31,231
Reminds me of that scary
TV series in the '60s.

252
00:16:31,335 --> 00:16:34,234
There's this pool hustler
guy who runs into this wacko.

253
00:16:34,338 --> 00:16:35,615
They get this bet going on.

254
00:16:35,718 --> 00:16:38,687
He doesn't realize he's
playing the devil in disguise.

255
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,481
What's your point?

256
00:16:42,277 --> 00:16:43,002
It was a great episode.

257
00:16:47,627 --> 00:16:48,386
It was.

258
00:17:23,663 --> 00:17:26,114
I think she was a virgin.

259
00:17:26,217 --> 00:17:27,253
Was.

260
00:17:27,356 --> 00:17:28,633
You idiot.

261
00:17:28,737 --> 00:17:30,049
You screwed her?

262
00:17:30,152 --> 00:17:33,224
You know I can't
touch any of them.

263
00:17:33,328 --> 00:17:35,088
Why do you think I
need you so badly, Cat?

264
00:18:47,298 --> 00:18:47,988
More.

265
00:18:56,549 --> 00:19:01,416
[moaning]

266
00:19:28,477 --> 00:19:29,547
Jesus.

267
00:19:29,651 --> 00:19:31,170
Time to wake up and
smell the coffee.

268
00:19:31,273 --> 00:19:33,172
If only you'd make it for us.

269
00:19:33,275 --> 00:19:35,381
Now, here's a list of
all the most recent cases

270
00:19:35,484 --> 00:19:37,348
having to do with
the occult and here's

271
00:19:37,452 --> 00:19:39,316
a list of people involved.

272
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:40,420
Look at all these people.

273
00:19:40,524 --> 00:19:41,697
This is going to take forever.

274
00:19:41,801 --> 00:19:43,837
Well, if I were you, I'd
start with this guy over here

275
00:19:43,941 --> 00:19:45,598
on the bottom-- Will Spanner.

276
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:49,118
Will Spanner, divorce lawyer.

277
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:51,259
Sounds like a bad TV series.

278
00:19:51,362 --> 00:19:53,744
What the hell's a divorce lawyer
going to know about the occult?

279
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:55,297
Don't you ever read the papers?

280
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:57,368
This guy Spanner's helped the
department out with the occult

281
00:19:57,472 --> 00:19:58,645
before.

282
00:19:58,749 --> 00:20:00,129
Word is his father
was some kind of

283
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,821
high ranking devil worshipper.

284
00:20:01,924 --> 00:20:02,649
Whoa.

285
00:20:02,753 --> 00:20:04,996
He sounds like our best bet.

286
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:10,485
We find him, he finds our man,
and we get all the credit.

287
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:12,280
Get me everything
you can on this guy.

288
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:13,108
I'll pay him a visit.

289
00:20:16,318 --> 00:20:17,492
What?

290
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:18,320
Please?

291
00:20:18,424 --> 00:20:21,599
Thank you?

292
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:23,429
You're welcome.

293
00:20:23,532 --> 00:20:24,533
OK, look.

294
00:20:24,637 --> 00:20:27,778
I want you to round
up all these loonies.

295
00:20:27,881 --> 00:20:30,298
Bring them to the
blue room tomorrow.

296
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:31,644
Why the blue room?

297
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:33,473
Because I want this Spanner
guy to watch the questioning

298
00:20:33,577 --> 00:20:34,888
from behind the mirror.

299
00:20:34,992 --> 00:20:35,993
Tell us what we don't see.

300
00:20:36,096 --> 00:20:38,513
And I suppose I have
to pick him up too?

301
00:20:38,616 --> 00:20:39,962
No.

302
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:42,033
You and I will pay him a visit
tomorrow morning at his home.

303
00:20:42,137 --> 00:20:44,967
I love getting
lawyers out of bed.

304
00:20:45,071 --> 00:20:47,004
Speaking of bed, where's Betty?

305
00:20:47,107 --> 00:20:48,350
I heard that.

306
00:20:48,454 --> 00:20:51,698
We're going home, out together.

307
00:20:51,802 --> 00:20:52,803
You want to join me?

308
00:20:52,906 --> 00:20:54,011
Stick with your
hand tonight, Garner.

309
00:20:54,114 --> 00:20:57,980
Only if you do the same, baby.

310
00:20:58,084 --> 00:20:59,982
Come on, let's get out of here.

311
00:21:08,232 --> 00:21:08,922
[inaudible]

312
00:21:35,363 --> 00:21:37,744
[gasp]

313
00:21:37,848 --> 00:21:39,712
What's wrong?

314
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:41,714
Nothing, I'm OK.

315
00:21:45,787 --> 00:21:47,202
[knocking]

316
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,652
Who the hell is that?

317
00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:56,625
[knocking]

318
00:22:06,048 --> 00:22:07,049
It's going to be
a great weekend.

319
00:22:07,153 --> 00:22:07,843
Mm-hm.

320
00:22:11,157 --> 00:22:12,503
First in the shower.

321
00:22:15,644 --> 00:22:17,991
[knocking]

322
00:22:25,585 --> 00:22:27,932
[knocking]

323
00:22:33,006 --> 00:22:35,871
[knocking]

324
00:22:47,642 --> 00:22:48,332
Garner.

325
00:22:48,436 --> 00:22:49,678
Uh, Mr. Spanner?

326
00:22:49,782 --> 00:22:50,472
SPANNER: Yeah.

327
00:22:50,576 --> 00:22:51,542
GARNER: Mr. Will Spanner.

328
00:22:51,646 --> 00:22:52,336
What do you want?

329
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,544
LAPD, homicide.

330
00:22:53,648 --> 00:22:54,925
We'd like to ask
you a few questions.

331
00:22:55,028 --> 00:22:55,995
I'd like to see your IDs.

332
00:23:00,827 --> 00:23:03,243
All right, come on in.

333
00:23:03,347 --> 00:23:04,037
Thanks.

334
00:23:06,764 --> 00:23:07,489
Thank.

335
00:23:07,593 --> 00:23:08,283
Sorry.

336
00:23:32,341 --> 00:23:33,757
So you want to tell me
what this is all about?

337
00:23:36,691 --> 00:23:39,487
Well, we'd prefer to do
this downtown, Mr. Spanner.

338
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,833
You telling me me
you're under arrest?

339
00:23:40,936 --> 00:23:42,213
Not at all.

340
00:23:42,317 --> 00:23:43,629
Just want to ask
you some questions.

341
00:23:43,732 --> 00:23:44,871
About what?

342
00:23:44,975 --> 00:23:46,770
Well, you've heard about
the murders, haven't you?

343
00:23:46,873 --> 00:23:48,047
The women?
-Yeah?

344
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,358
So what's that
got to do with me?

345
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:52,396
Our records show that you
have some special knowledge

346
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,778
of the occult.
And we have reason

347
00:23:54,881 --> 00:23:57,401
to believe that our suspect
is killing these women

348
00:23:57,505 --> 00:23:59,783
for some ritualistic purpose.

349
00:23:59,886 --> 00:24:03,407
And we think you might be able
to help us find our suspect.

350
00:24:03,511 --> 00:24:04,546
Guys, I'm a divorce lawyer.

351
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,100
I deal with dead
marriages, not dead women.

352
00:24:07,204 --> 00:24:08,412
Ha, that's funny.

353
00:24:11,795 --> 00:24:14,383
It would mean a great deal to
the department, Mr. Spanner.

354
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:17,283
We have no leads, nothing.

355
00:24:17,386 --> 00:24:20,148
We're hanging at the
end of a rope here.

356
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,977
Innocent women
are being murdered.

357
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:24,255
You could help us
save the next victim.

358
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,049
Good book.

359
00:24:25,153 --> 00:24:27,638
Put that back.

360
00:24:27,742 --> 00:24:28,432
Lutz here.

361
00:24:28,536 --> 00:24:29,398
COP [RADIO]: Unit 238.

362
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:30,745
Go ahead.

363
00:24:30,848 --> 00:24:32,298
COP [RADIO]: We just found
another girl-- Whitely Heights.

364
00:24:32,401 --> 00:24:33,299
LUTZ: Jesus Christ.

365
00:24:33,402 --> 00:24:34,127
COP [RADIO]: We're
going to need you

366
00:24:34,231 --> 00:24:35,197
down at the morgue immediately.

367
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:35,991
We'll be right there.

368
00:24:39,547 --> 00:24:41,065
It's number four.

369
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:43,067
You see what I mean?

370
00:24:43,171 --> 00:24:44,793
Why don't you come down with us?

371
00:24:44,897 --> 00:24:47,831
Maybe you'll see
something we don't.

372
00:24:47,934 --> 00:24:49,108
All right, let me get dressed.

373
00:24:54,596 --> 00:24:57,185
So what do you think?

374
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,290
About what?

375
00:24:59,394 --> 00:25:00,153
I was just asking.

376
00:25:03,674 --> 00:25:05,227
You're in a big hurry.

377
00:25:05,331 --> 00:25:06,056
Who is it?

378
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,885
It's the police.

379
00:25:07,989 --> 00:25:11,510
Making house calls at 7 AM?

380
00:25:11,613 --> 00:25:14,996
They think I can help in
their investigation, honey.

381
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:15,790
What investigation?

382
00:25:19,863 --> 00:25:21,450
Will?
-I don't know.

383
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:23,694
I'll know more later.

384
00:25:23,798 --> 00:25:25,385
Will, we had plans for today.

385
00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:26,559
I know, sweetheart.

386
00:25:26,663 --> 00:25:27,353
I'm sorry.

387
00:25:27,456 --> 00:25:28,181
We'll do it next weekend.

388
00:25:28,285 --> 00:25:29,079
I promise.

389
00:25:29,182 --> 00:25:30,563
Now, I got to go.

390
00:25:36,638 --> 00:25:37,328
WOMAN: Will.

391
00:25:37,432 --> 00:25:38,122
SPANNER: Yeah.

392
00:25:42,023 --> 00:25:43,472
We can't go through this again.

393
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:44,473
I know.

394
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:45,267
Come here.

395
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:53,862
[clears throat]

396
00:26:13,848 --> 00:26:16,575
Catch a look at her crotch?

397
00:26:16,678 --> 00:26:18,922
I haven't gotten that far yet,
but I'm sure that what's down

398
00:26:19,025 --> 00:26:19,992
there won't surprise me, Garner.

399
00:26:20,095 --> 00:26:20,820
No, no, no.

400
00:26:20,924 --> 00:26:23,202
I'm not talking about that.

401
00:26:23,305 --> 00:26:24,099
Take a look at that.

402
00:26:27,516 --> 00:26:29,864
That mean anything
to you, counselor?

403
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:32,073
Counselor?

404
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:33,005
Counselor, are you all right?

405
00:26:33,108 --> 00:26:36,422
[moaning]

406
00:26:39,321 --> 00:26:40,322
She's marked for sacrifice.

407
00:26:40,426 --> 00:26:42,531
Sacrifice to who?

408
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:44,361
Satan.

409
00:26:44,464 --> 00:26:45,845
Satan.

410
00:26:45,949 --> 00:26:46,812
The Satan?

411
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,404
Mr.-- Mr. Goober.

412
00:26:53,508 --> 00:26:57,477
That is pronounced joo-bear.

413
00:26:57,581 --> 00:27:02,103
Mr. Jew Bear, can you
tell me the significance

414
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:05,416
of these markings here?

415
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,866
Does it mean anything
supernatural?

416
00:27:13,804 --> 00:27:15,047
Well?

417
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:20,155
[speaking french]

418
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:21,640
What does it mean?

419
00:27:21,743 --> 00:27:24,021
Well, it reminds
me of a necklace

420
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:27,231
my mother used to wear before
the [inaudible] marched

421
00:27:27,335 --> 00:27:28,854
into Vichy.

422
00:27:28,957 --> 00:27:30,200
What?

423
00:27:30,303 --> 00:27:33,237
--[speaking french] I'd
given her this necklace.

424
00:27:33,341 --> 00:27:35,343
But then, the Germans, they came
in and they took everything.

425
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:37,414
they were [speaking french]

426
00:27:37,517 --> 00:27:40,659
Mister-- Mr. G?

427
00:27:40,762 --> 00:27:42,971
Stick to the subject, OK?

428
00:27:43,075 --> 00:27:45,594
We're not hear to discuss your
family history, all right?

429
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:47,010
So you getting
anything from this guy?

430
00:27:47,113 --> 00:27:48,149
No, this guy's a fruit cakes.

431
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:49,219
Get rid of him.

432
00:27:49,322 --> 00:27:50,599
--significance of
these markings here.

433
00:27:50,703 --> 00:27:56,122
It is the symbol of our lord
almighty's love for all those

434
00:27:56,226 --> 00:27:58,953
who think of him
as the only savior.

435
00:28:01,645 --> 00:28:03,612
Mister-- Mr. G?

436
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:07,789
This is a very important
police investigation.

437
00:28:07,893 --> 00:28:11,759
And I must tell you that after
listening to you now and all

438
00:28:11,862 --> 00:28:14,140
the other fruit cake
I've listened to today,

439
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:16,522
I think you're full of shit.

440
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:18,351
You know, what gives
you the authority

441
00:28:18,455 --> 00:28:19,836
to be spouting off this crap?

442
00:28:19,939 --> 00:28:22,114
It says here you
own a small fortune

443
00:28:22,217 --> 00:28:23,460
telling shop at Silver Lake.

444
00:28:23,563 --> 00:28:25,738
Now, why the hell
should I believe

445
00:28:25,842 --> 00:28:28,672
anything you have to say, pal?

446
00:28:28,776 --> 00:28:32,020
Because, monsieur,
I am the collected

447
00:28:32,124 --> 00:28:34,782
for our lord almighty.

448
00:28:34,885 --> 00:28:36,197
Is that right?

449
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,612
Oui.

450
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,546
At this moment, I am preparing
for the coming of our lord.

451
00:28:40,649 --> 00:28:41,478
Oh?

452
00:28:41,581 --> 00:28:45,309
Oh, when is that?

453
00:28:45,413 --> 00:28:49,589
A week from this Tuesday
around dinner time.

454
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:51,005
Around dinner time.

455
00:28:51,108 --> 00:28:53,697
He's going to be very hungry
from his journey. [inaudible].

456
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:56,079
OK, pal.

457
00:28:56,182 --> 00:28:57,563
We have everything
we need from you.

458
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:58,944
Thanks

459
00:28:59,047 --> 00:29:00,773
Merci, officer.

460
00:29:00,877 --> 00:29:03,914
Our lord will look very
favorably upon you.

461
00:29:04,018 --> 00:29:05,398
Yeah, whatever you say.

462
00:29:16,893 --> 00:29:18,757
How you like that
one, counselor?

463
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:28,559
You see this, counselor?

464
00:29:28,663 --> 00:29:29,457
Belongs to my wife.

465
00:29:32,391 --> 00:29:34,703
This belonged to the deceased.

466
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:35,843
What can you tell us about her?

467
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:52,583
She was a beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful pretty girl.

468
00:29:52,687 --> 00:29:54,758
Blonde, blue eyes.

469
00:29:58,555 --> 00:30:01,454
Oh she always want
to be a cheer leader.

470
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:05,907
Oh, but she never make
it to the first cut.

471
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:12,293
That is when she became-- when
she became oh lord, religious.

472
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,368
Right.

473
00:30:18,471 --> 00:30:21,923
She died a painful death.

474
00:30:22,027 --> 00:30:24,926
Oh, I can feel her suffocating.

475
00:30:28,343 --> 00:30:31,381
No, she was stabbed
in the heart.

476
00:30:31,484 --> 00:30:36,351
No, the throat.

477
00:30:36,455 --> 00:30:37,628
You sure about this?

478
00:30:37,732 --> 00:30:39,665
Fuck you.

479
00:30:39,768 --> 00:30:40,942
You asked me here.

480
00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:42,495
I'm doing you a favor.

481
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:44,704
Don't you call me a liar.

482
00:30:44,808 --> 00:30:46,154
I'll break your fucking neck!

483
00:30:46,258 --> 00:30:48,087
Hey, watch your
language, asshole.

484
00:30:48,191 --> 00:30:49,675
This is a police station.

485
00:30:49,778 --> 00:30:50,814
I'm kind of nervous.

486
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:53,127
I've never been inside
a police station before.

487
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,059
So--

488
00:30:54,162 --> 00:30:55,370
Uh huh.

489
00:30:55,474 --> 00:30:59,409
What can you tell us
about the deceased?

490
00:30:59,512 --> 00:31:01,307
Oh, oh, uh, yes.

491
00:31:01,411 --> 00:31:09,177
She-- she was a
fucking nympho, man.

492
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:14,596
I mean, this girl enjoyed it
very-- if you know what I mean.

493
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,323
What do you mean?

494
00:31:17,427 --> 00:31:25,953
I mean, this girl came before
she went if you get my drift.

495
00:31:26,056 --> 00:31:28,679
Hey, look.

496
00:31:28,783 --> 00:31:30,889
Do you think you can
give me the panties?

497
00:31:30,992 --> 00:31:32,752
Because I can tell
you a lot more

498
00:31:32,856 --> 00:31:34,651
if you give me the panties.

499
00:31:34,754 --> 00:31:35,859
You're disgusting.

500
00:31:35,963 --> 00:31:37,965
Get the hell out of here.

501
00:31:38,068 --> 00:31:39,725
Wait, just give me
a few more minutes.

502
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,350
She was a big girl.

503
00:31:44,454 --> 00:31:47,388
What do you mean big?

504
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:48,216
Big boobs.

505
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,010
Big boobies.

506
00:31:52,462 --> 00:31:57,156
She had big nipples.

507
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,987
I think that's from
having so many children.

508
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,127
What can you tell
us about the killer?

509
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:06,407
--[speaking spanish]
your killer--

510
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:12,344
your killer used to work at
a taco stand in El Segundo.

511
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:15,830
And before that-- before that,
he worked at a service station

512
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,901
in Paquime.

513
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:20,145
Madre-- and before that--

514
00:32:20,248 --> 00:32:22,009
LUTZ: Yeah, thanks
for the job history.

515
00:32:22,112 --> 00:32:23,769
We just want to know what
kind of criminal mind

516
00:32:23,872 --> 00:32:25,978
we're dealing with here.

517
00:32:26,082 --> 00:32:29,257
We're dealing with a bipolar
affective personality--

518
00:32:29,361 --> 00:32:32,122
a man who seeks
pious women as a way

519
00:32:32,226 --> 00:32:37,024
to resolve his own religious
repression dating as far

520
00:32:37,127 --> 00:32:40,337
back as early childhood
Sunday school classes

521
00:32:40,441 --> 00:32:44,100
where he was forced to do
things, awful things, which we

522
00:32:44,203 --> 00:32:46,688
must not speak of in this room.

523
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:49,174
Well, that's why you're
here, pal-- to speak.

524
00:32:49,277 --> 00:32:50,347
So can you help us out?

525
00:32:57,837 --> 00:32:59,115
Hello?

526
00:32:59,218 --> 00:32:59,943
Can you help us out?

527
00:33:03,636 --> 00:33:06,122
OK, that's about all for today.

528
00:33:06,225 --> 00:33:08,607
Thanks.

529
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,401
Thank you.

530
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:10,195
Thanks.

531
00:33:15,027 --> 00:33:17,340
Hey, sleeping beauty.

532
00:33:17,443 --> 00:33:18,893
This is a big
fucking waste of time

533
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,964
and it's really
starting to piss me off.

534
00:33:21,068 --> 00:33:23,863
How many have we got left?

535
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:25,693
Just one.

536
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:29,593
Well, finally, we're
coming to an end.

537
00:33:29,697 --> 00:33:30,594
How are you doing counselor?

538
00:33:30,698 --> 00:33:32,665
How much longer do
I need to be here?

539
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:34,633
What, you're not
having a good time?

540
00:33:34,736 --> 00:33:35,737
Hey, Garner.

541
00:33:35,841 --> 00:33:37,325
Counselor here's not
having a good time.

542
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:39,431
Look, you've got me up
early on a Sunday morning.

543
00:33:39,534 --> 00:33:41,260
Now you got me watching
the cast of "One

544
00:33:41,364 --> 00:33:42,675
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"?

545
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:44,643
Hey, you got to do
something better than this.

546
00:33:44,746 --> 00:33:45,920
Hey, relax.

547
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,784
Just do your thing and
feel that rhythm of yours

548
00:33:47,887 --> 00:33:50,787
and tell us which one of these
crackpots is talking sense.

549
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,237
We've got one more left.

550
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,723
So stop complaining and cut us
a little slack here, all right?

551
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:58,484
All right, but I need
to make a phone call.

552
00:33:58,588 --> 00:33:59,830
Pay phone in the hallway.

553
00:33:59,934 --> 00:34:03,248
Counselor, don't
disappear on us, OK?

554
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:50,433
Please, don't stare.

555
00:35:00,788 --> 00:35:01,892
That mean anything to you?

556
00:35:04,757 --> 00:35:06,828
Who does it belong to?

557
00:35:06,932 --> 00:35:07,829
Your wife?

558
00:35:13,939 --> 00:35:16,252
Don't be smart.

559
00:35:16,355 --> 00:35:19,772
Surely you're not suggesting
that I sit here and lie to you.

560
00:35:19,876 --> 00:35:20,566
Are you, officer?

561
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:25,537
Take a look at this photograph.

562
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,332
Does that mean anything to you?

563
00:35:39,413 --> 00:35:40,793
Well?

564
00:35:40,897 --> 00:35:42,864
Does it mean anything to you?

565
00:35:42,968 --> 00:35:45,350
I regret to say
that it does not.

566
00:36:14,102 --> 00:36:15,518
Mr. Savante--

567
00:36:15,621 --> 00:36:16,588
[woman crying]

568
00:36:16,691 --> 00:36:18,521
--these markings
mean nothing to you?

569
00:36:18,624 --> 00:36:21,800
I thought you were some kind
of expert in the supernatural.

570
00:36:21,903 --> 00:36:24,906
I own a small curio shop.

571
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:28,151
I deal in ancient artifacts.

572
00:36:28,255 --> 00:36:31,810
I hardly see how that
qualifies me as some expert

573
00:36:31,913 --> 00:36:35,193
on the supernatural.

574
00:36:35,296 --> 00:36:38,886
Well, what the hell are you
doing here wasting your time?

575
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:42,476
You called me.

576
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:45,272
Frankly, I have no idea.

577
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:47,688
I apologize.

578
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:50,829
You can-- you can leave.

579
00:36:50,932 --> 00:36:51,623
Thank you.

580
00:37:03,151 --> 00:37:05,499
Oh, and good luck.

581
00:37:26,692 --> 00:37:28,763
So what did you think
of that wacko, counselor?

582
00:37:28,867 --> 00:37:30,938
Arrest him.

583
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:31,939
Him?

584
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:32,940
Yeah, he's your man.

585
00:37:36,737 --> 00:37:37,462
OK, Spanner.

586
00:37:37,565 --> 00:37:40,327
I tell you what we'll do.

587
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,121
We'll check his alibi, OK?

588
00:37:42,225 --> 00:37:44,779
Why don't you go home and spend
some time with that pretty

589
00:37:44,883 --> 00:37:46,643
little girl of yours
and put your thinking

590
00:37:46,747 --> 00:37:49,819
cap on and look forward
to seeing us tomorrow, OK?

591
00:37:49,922 --> 00:37:50,613
Great.

592
00:37:56,688 --> 00:37:57,344
Savante, eh?

593
00:38:00,588 --> 00:38:01,279
Yeah.

594
00:38:15,223 --> 00:38:17,605
WOMAN; I was just on the
phone with the station.

595
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:18,710
Thanks for calling.

596
00:38:18,813 --> 00:38:19,504
I'm sorry, honey.

597
00:38:19,607 --> 00:38:20,539
I couldn't get to a phone.

598
00:38:23,784 --> 00:38:25,337
Do you mind telling
me what's going on?

599
00:38:25,441 --> 00:38:27,166
The police seem to
think their serial killer

600
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,755
is involved with the occult.
They want me to help find him.

601
00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:31,999
Come on-- stay out of it, Will.

602
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:33,034
I can't stay out of it.

603
00:38:33,138 --> 00:38:35,382
They won't let me
stay out of it.

604
00:38:35,485 --> 00:38:36,969
Tell me something.

605
00:38:37,073 --> 00:38:38,764
Do you have some sort
of crazy death wish?

606
00:38:38,868 --> 00:38:39,938
Nope, I don't.

607
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:41,146
But innocent women
are being murdered

608
00:38:41,249 --> 00:38:43,804
and I just can't stand
by and watch it happen.

609
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:45,081
Just forget it.

610
00:38:45,184 --> 00:38:46,151
I'll be all right.

611
00:38:46,254 --> 00:38:47,946
They can't give me this time.

612
00:38:48,049 --> 00:38:49,534
They can always get you, Will.

613
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,807
You wanted to see me.

614
00:39:21,911 --> 00:39:23,395
Come here, my dear.

615
00:39:30,678 --> 00:39:38,306
I encountered a most interesting
young man today-- Will Spanner.

616
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,379
Because that name
mean anything to you?

617
00:39:41,482 --> 00:39:43,864
Of course.

618
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:46,522
He was once one of us.

619
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:48,972
But he rejected the
path of our lord.

620
00:39:51,803 --> 00:39:57,602
I believe that he could be a
thorn in our side, so to speak.

621
00:39:57,705 --> 00:40:01,329
I want you to pluck him.

622
00:40:01,433 --> 00:40:03,573
So to speak?

623
00:40:03,677 --> 00:40:05,437
Yes.

624
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:10,200
He could be a great service
to us with his powers.

625
00:40:10,304 --> 00:40:14,964
I suspect that he is in contact
with our virgin sacrifice.

626
00:40:15,067 --> 00:40:18,623
And he's protecting her from us.

627
00:40:18,726 --> 00:40:20,935
Bring him back.

628
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:26,285
Bring him back to us the
best way you know how.

629
00:40:34,915 --> 00:40:39,437
In some cultures,
they consider the egg

630
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,335
to symbolize the human soul.

631
00:40:51,552 --> 00:40:54,175
I think of Mr. Spanner
as an egg, my dear.

632
00:41:25,793 --> 00:41:26,484
Drive.

633
00:41:42,534 --> 00:41:45,157
Danny, I can't.

634
00:41:45,261 --> 00:41:48,022
Of course I still love you.

635
00:41:48,126 --> 00:41:50,887
I got to call you back.

636
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:51,957
Any messages?

637
00:41:52,061 --> 00:41:53,683
No.

638
00:41:53,787 --> 00:41:55,789
But there's somebody
waiting for you.

639
00:41:55,892 --> 00:41:56,859
Who is it?

640
00:41:56,962 --> 00:41:58,792
Mrs. Rehnquist.

641
00:41:58,895 --> 00:41:59,965
Well, where is she?

642
00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:01,346
In your office.

643
00:42:01,449 --> 00:42:02,796
What is she doing in my office?

644
00:42:02,899 --> 00:42:06,869
Um, well, I didn't know when
you were going to be back.

645
00:42:06,972 --> 00:42:08,284
And she was so insistent.

646
00:42:08,387 --> 00:42:09,665
I thought you knew her.

647
00:42:17,189 --> 00:42:19,088
[clears throat]

648
00:42:19,191 --> 00:42:20,330
Excuse me, Mrs. Rehnquist.

649
00:42:20,434 --> 00:42:21,504
What can I do for you?

650
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:23,230
That's a loaded question.

651
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:26,578
For me, a divorce.

652
00:42:26,682 --> 00:42:27,475
What can I do for you?

653
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:40,350
Look, I'm very busy here.

654
00:42:40,454 --> 00:42:41,662
I know you are.

655
00:42:41,766 --> 00:42:43,975
That's why I've chosen
you to represent me.

656
00:42:44,078 --> 00:42:46,425
My husband left
me six months ago

657
00:42:46,529 --> 00:42:49,152
and I'd like to finalize the
divorce as soon as possible

658
00:42:49,256 --> 00:42:50,947
so I can get on with my life.

659
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:52,086
Of course.

660
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:54,675
My husband thinks that
I've been promiscuous.

661
00:42:54,779 --> 00:42:57,367
And he's trying to screw
me out of my money.

662
00:42:57,471 --> 00:42:59,680
I simply want what's mine.

663
00:42:59,784 --> 00:43:01,509
Well, have you
been promiscuous?

664
00:43:01,613 --> 00:43:02,787
Who wants to know?

665
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,133
I do.

666
00:43:04,236 --> 00:43:06,929
I need to know the facts if
I decide to represent you.

667
00:43:07,032 --> 00:43:09,034
If you decide to represent me?

668
00:43:09,138 --> 00:43:12,003
A lawyer who plays hard to get.

669
00:43:12,106 --> 00:43:13,418
That's a new one.

670
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:14,937
Maybe we should
test my promiscuity.

671
00:43:28,191 --> 00:43:29,814
No, I don't think so.

672
00:43:29,917 --> 00:43:31,160
Besides, it would be
bad for your case.

673
00:43:31,263 --> 00:43:32,886
Well, you know what they say.

674
00:43:32,989 --> 00:43:35,889
There are some women whose
fidelities are the only link

675
00:43:35,992 --> 00:43:37,615
they have with their husbands.

676
00:43:37,718 --> 00:43:40,134
If you put a tail on him, you'll
see he's no different than me.

677
00:43:40,238 --> 00:43:43,103
If you can prove it, then I'll
get the settlement I deserve.

678
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,488
That's him, the bastard.

679
00:43:52,491 --> 00:43:53,976
He's a handsome man.

680
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,910
I see better.

681
00:43:57,013 --> 00:44:00,430
Well, are you going
to represent me?

682
00:44:00,534 --> 00:44:03,123
I'll make it worth
your while, Will.

683
00:44:03,226 --> 00:44:05,125
All right, my fee is $300.

684
00:44:05,228 --> 00:44:07,852
An hour.

685
00:44:07,955 --> 00:44:09,716
Fine.

686
00:44:09,819 --> 00:44:10,855
You've made the right decision.

687
00:44:14,755 --> 00:44:16,964
OK, you can see my
secretary on the way

688
00:44:17,068 --> 00:44:18,621
out, fill out the proper
paperwork, Mrs. Rehnquist.

689
00:44:26,249 --> 00:44:28,355
My husband bar tends
at The Black Cat.

690
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:31,461
I think he's having an affair
with one of the dancers there.

691
00:44:31,565 --> 00:44:32,739
I'll see you soon, Will.

692
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:39,633
Good to see you.

693
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:40,427
[inaudible].

694
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,161
Can I get you a drink?

695
00:45:50,264 --> 00:45:51,300
I'll have a scotch, please.

696
00:46:18,016 --> 00:46:18,706
Thanks.

697
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:31,789
She's quite a looker, isn't she?

698
00:46:31,892 --> 00:46:33,238
You really think so?

699
00:46:33,342 --> 00:46:34,757
You don't?

700
00:46:34,861 --> 00:46:37,415
Well, I suppose.

701
00:46:37,518 --> 00:46:39,866
I've been fucking
her for the last year.

702
00:46:39,969 --> 00:46:41,281
Oh?

703
00:46:41,384 --> 00:46:44,146
Guess by now I'm getting kind
of bored, you know what I mean?

704
00:46:44,249 --> 00:46:45,664
Oh, sure.

705
00:46:45,768 --> 00:46:47,528
Oh, so you've been
there too, I take it.

706
00:46:47,632 --> 00:46:50,808
No, no I haven't been there.

707
00:46:50,911 --> 00:46:57,262
But if you're interested,
I'm sure I can introduce you.

708
00:46:57,366 --> 00:46:58,746
Might do you some good.

709
00:48:47,994 --> 00:48:49,271
Jesus Christ, Spanner.

710
00:48:49,374 --> 00:48:53,378
If you can't hold your alcohol,
don't fucking drinking, huh?

711
00:48:53,482 --> 00:48:55,242
I should have your ass arrested.

712
00:48:55,346 --> 00:48:57,279
You're a lawyer,
not an investigator.

713
00:48:57,382 --> 00:48:59,281
What the fuck you doing
snooping around here, anyway?

714
00:48:59,384 --> 00:49:01,110
You're going to screw up
this entire investigation.

715
00:49:01,214 --> 00:49:02,629
What are you talking about?

716
00:49:02,732 --> 00:49:05,287
I was paid by a client
to tail her husband.

717
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:06,391
LUTZ: What?

718
00:49:06,495 --> 00:49:07,806
Yeah.

719
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:09,187
Oh, and he just so happened to
be hanging at The Black Cat,

720
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:10,809
right?
-He's the bartender.

721
00:49:10,913 --> 00:49:13,157
Is there something
strange about that?

722
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:13,985
Strange?

723
00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:15,953
I'll tell you strange, pal.

724
00:49:16,056 --> 00:49:17,333
It just so happens
that our friend

725
00:49:17,437 --> 00:49:20,509
Savante owns The Black Cat.

726
00:49:20,612 --> 00:49:22,028
A little too coincidental,
don't you think?

727
00:49:34,178 --> 00:49:37,595
How easily the
flesh is corrupted.

728
00:49:37,698 --> 00:49:39,528
Cat will enjoy this conquest.

729
00:49:48,606 --> 00:49:50,021
You got to arrest him.

730
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:50,815
We can't.

731
00:49:50,918 --> 00:49:52,299
We've got nothing on him.

732
00:49:52,403 --> 00:49:54,957
Then why did you call me?

733
00:49:55,061 --> 00:49:55,751
You know what?

734
00:49:55,854 --> 00:49:56,959
Go fuck yourself.

735
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,000
Don't say a word.

736
00:50:03,103 --> 00:50:03,793
Shit.

737
00:50:10,835 --> 00:50:12,043
REPORTER [RADIO]:
Another chapter

738
00:50:12,147 --> 00:50:15,150
in this tragic tale-- a fourth
woman has been murdered.

739
00:50:15,253 --> 00:50:17,980
The police are still baffled,
as no leads have been found.

740
00:50:23,123 --> 00:50:23,813
Kelly?

741
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,363
Sorry about yesterday.

742
00:50:56,467 --> 00:50:58,365
SPANNER: It's OK.

743
00:50:58,469 --> 00:51:02,369
Think I can make it up to you?

744
00:51:02,473 --> 00:51:03,336
I think you can.

745
00:55:08,995 --> 00:55:10,065
What the hell's wrong with you?

746
00:55:10,168 --> 00:55:11,273
SPANNER: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

747
00:55:11,377 --> 00:55:12,274
I'm sorry.

748
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:43,063
And now, my child, prepare
your body for our lord Satan.

749
00:56:21,585 --> 00:56:24,967
[scream]

750
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:10,116
You have failed me once again.

751
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:11,566
Dispose of her.

752
00:57:11,669 --> 00:57:15,949
And if you fail me once
more, I will dispose of yo.

753
00:57:35,935 --> 00:57:37,730
You morons seen
the morning paper?

754
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:38,558
What?

755
00:57:38,662 --> 00:57:39,663
What?

756
00:57:39,766 --> 00:57:41,216
Well, the mayor has
seen the morning paper.

757
00:57:41,319 --> 00:57:43,425
And he has been on the
phone to me to find out why

758
00:57:43,529 --> 00:57:44,771
this case hasn't been solved

759
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:45,634
We're right on top of it.

760
00:57:45,738 --> 00:57:46,532
Right on top of it?

761
00:57:46,635 --> 00:57:47,636
It's been a month.

762
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,224
You don't even have
anybody under arrest.

763
00:57:49,327 --> 00:57:50,570
You don't even have
any fucking suspects.

764
00:57:50,674 --> 00:57:52,365
We've been working
hard on this case.

765
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,711
It hasn't been an
easy case, Captain.

766
00:57:53,815 --> 00:57:54,850
You're right.
I mean,

767
00:57:54,954 --> 00:57:56,300
Well, I don't care about
how hard you're working.

768
00:57:56,403 --> 00:57:57,646
I want to see results.

769
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,993
Well, we have some results.

770
00:58:00,097 --> 00:58:01,098
We do have results.

771
00:58:01,201 --> 00:58:02,582
That's it, OK?

772
00:58:02,686 --> 00:58:04,584
You guys are off the case.

773
00:58:04,688 --> 00:58:06,379
Just take a look at our report.

774
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,726
I don't want to look
at your fucking report.

775
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:10,417
Simon and Meikiwitz are
taking over this case.

776
00:58:10,521 --> 00:58:12,661
Turn over your
file to them ASAP.

777
00:58:12,765 --> 00:58:13,593
But Captain--

778
00:58:13,697 --> 00:58:17,217
That is all.

779
00:58:17,321 --> 00:58:19,116
Who the fuck are you?

780
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:30,645
Hey, wait a second.

781
00:58:30,748 --> 00:58:32,129
Hey, we're one step
away from uncovering

782
00:58:32,232 --> 00:58:33,544
something her,e guys.

783
00:58:33,648 --> 00:58:35,028
You can't just drop it.

784
00:58:35,132 --> 00:58:36,167
Spanner, we're off the case.

785
00:58:36,271 --> 00:58:36,996
So are you, pal.

786
00:58:37,099 --> 00:58:38,307
Yeah, but we're so close.

787
00:58:38,411 --> 00:58:39,343
Close but no cigar.

788
00:58:39,446 --> 00:58:41,345
You ever hear that one?

789
00:58:41,448 --> 00:58:42,380
Next time, huh?

790
00:58:42,484 --> 00:58:43,174
Yeah.

791
00:58:49,284 --> 00:58:50,906
You think it's that
nutso Savante, don't you?

792
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:54,220
Yes, I do.

793
00:58:54,323 --> 00:58:56,049
Well, unfortunately,
we can't go

794
00:58:56,153 --> 00:58:57,672
around locking people
up just because they

795
00:58:57,775 --> 00:58:59,156
give you the creeps.

796
00:58:59,259 --> 00:58:59,984
All right, Lutz.

797
00:59:00,088 --> 00:59:00,813
I've tried to help.

798
00:59:00,916 --> 00:59:02,711
You're making a big mistake.

799
00:59:02,815 --> 00:59:04,575
How many more bodies have
to show up before you realize

800
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:06,335
what the hell's going on?

801
00:59:06,439 --> 00:59:07,509
Hey, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

802
00:59:07,613 --> 00:59:08,303
Hold on.

803
00:59:11,617 --> 00:59:17,243
Look, obviously I'm just
desperate enough to go

804
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:19,141
along with you on this one.

805
00:59:19,245 --> 00:59:22,973
I want to solve this thing
just as bad as you do, Spanner.

806
00:59:23,076 --> 00:59:24,975
You can count on me.

807
00:59:25,078 --> 00:59:25,769
All right?

808
00:59:31,464 --> 00:59:33,673
You have been a
great disappointment

809
00:59:33,777 --> 00:59:36,055
to me, my darling Cat.

810
00:59:36,158 --> 00:59:40,404
The eclipse draws near
and yet you have failed

811
00:59:40,507 --> 00:59:41,854
to find the proper sacrifice.

812
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,376
What am I to do with you?

813
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:48,861
You must trust me.

814
00:59:48,964 --> 00:59:51,277
I only need more time.

815
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:52,727
Time?

816
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:55,246
There is no more time.

817
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:59,457
Satan must have his virgin
mistress before the eclipse.

818
00:59:59,561 --> 01:00:03,116
Only then will the forces
of hell be unleashed to lead

819
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:05,360
the way to the apocalypse.

820
01:00:05,463 --> 01:00:09,329
That only gives us
until tomorrow night.

821
01:00:09,433 --> 01:00:12,816
Perhaps I have
underestimated you, my dear.

822
01:00:12,919 --> 01:00:19,098
As I said before, Mr. Spanner
holds the key to our sacrifice.

823
01:00:19,201 --> 01:00:22,515
And yet you have been
most soft with him.

824
01:00:25,173 --> 01:00:27,140
Careless, too.

825
01:00:27,244 --> 01:00:28,383
Give me one more chance.

826
01:00:28,486 --> 01:00:30,385
I promise I won't
disappoint you.

827
01:01:09,838 --> 01:01:11,219
What are you doing?

828
01:01:11,322 --> 01:01:13,048
Hi.

829
01:01:13,152 --> 01:01:14,740
Don't you make appointments?

830
01:01:14,843 --> 01:01:15,982
I was in the neighborhood.

831
01:01:16,086 --> 01:01:16,811
Oh, right.

832
01:01:16,914 --> 01:01:17,846
Dressed like that?

833
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:18,675
Like what?

834
01:01:18,778 --> 01:01:21,056
I'm wearing a simple red dress.

835
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:21,850
Yeah.

836
01:01:28,857 --> 01:01:30,894
Actually, I'm glad you
dropped by, Mrs. Rehnquist.

837
01:01:30,997 --> 01:01:32,136
Oh?

838
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,242
SPANNER: I paid a visit to
your husband last night.

839
01:01:34,345 --> 01:01:35,622
And?

840
01:01:35,726 --> 01:01:38,349
And I feel there are some
things you're not telling me.

841
01:01:38,453 --> 01:01:40,386
There's a lot I'm
not telling you.

842
01:01:40,489 --> 01:01:42,629
It's a matter of asking
the right questions.

843
01:01:42,733 --> 01:01:43,734
Here's a question.

844
01:01:43,838 --> 01:01:45,046
What's the connection
between your husband

845
01:01:45,149 --> 01:01:47,082
and Charles Savante?

846
01:01:47,186 --> 01:01:48,532
Savante?

847
01:01:48,635 --> 01:01:50,258
Savante.

848
01:01:50,361 --> 01:01:51,431
I'm drawing a blank.

849
01:01:51,535 --> 01:01:52,570
Look, Mrs. Rehnquist.

850
01:01:52,674 --> 01:01:54,227
I've had one day to
follow up on your case.

851
01:01:54,331 --> 01:01:56,298
I don't work at
the speed of light.

852
01:01:56,402 --> 01:01:59,785
I bet you work extremely fast
under the proper circumstances.

853
01:01:59,888 --> 01:02:01,027
Stop that, Mrs. Rehnquist.

854
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:02,028
Stop what?

855
01:02:02,132 --> 01:02:03,685
This is not going
to help your case.

856
01:02:03,789 --> 01:02:05,445
It helps more than you know.

857
01:02:05,549 --> 01:02:08,897
[laughing]

858
01:02:18,113 --> 01:02:24,326
Mr. Spanner-- Mr. Spanner,
are you all right?

859
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:25,603
How long have you
been standing there?

860
01:02:25,707 --> 01:02:26,984
A few minutes.

861
01:02:27,088 --> 01:02:30,885
That must've been
quite a day dream.

862
01:02:30,988 --> 01:02:32,438
You were telling me what
you got on my husband.

863
01:02:35,165 --> 01:02:37,029
Right.

864
01:02:37,132 --> 01:02:38,168
You were right.

865
01:02:38,271 --> 01:02:40,170
He did admit to having
an affair with a dancer.

866
01:02:40,273 --> 01:02:40,998
Well, move on it.

867
01:02:41,102 --> 01:02:42,793
That's what I'm paying you for

868
01:02:42,897 --> 01:02:44,519
I'm moving as fast as
I can, Mrs. Rehnquist.

869
01:02:44,622 --> 01:02:46,521
I've just been a bit tied up.

870
01:02:46,624 --> 01:02:48,454
Hm, that's a thought.

871
01:02:48,557 --> 01:02:51,768
SECRETARY [INTERCOM]: Mr.
Spanner, Kelly's on the line.

872
01:02:51,871 --> 01:02:54,080
Tell her I'll be
right with her.

873
01:02:54,184 --> 01:02:54,909
You have to go.

874
01:03:03,469 --> 01:03:04,781
But we have more to talk about.

875
01:03:04,884 --> 01:03:06,230
Then make an appointment.

876
01:03:06,334 --> 01:03:07,197
Who's Kelly?

877
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:08,163
That's none of your concern.

878
01:03:08,267 --> 01:03:09,820
But it is my concern.

879
01:03:24,007 --> 01:03:25,077
Hi, honey.
KELLY [INTERCOM]: What's wrong?

880
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:26,492
You OK?
-No, nothing.

881
01:03:26,595 --> 01:03:27,458
KELLY [INTERCOM]: Will--

882
01:03:27,562 --> 01:03:28,977
Nothing, I'm just tired.

883
01:03:29,081 --> 01:03:30,496
KELLY [INTERCOM]: Are
we still on for a movie?

884
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:32,118
No, I can't do that tonight.

885
01:03:32,222 --> 01:03:32,981
KELLY [INTERCOM]: Why not?

886
01:03:33,085 --> 01:03:34,465
No, I've got too
much work to do.

887
01:03:34,569 --> 01:03:35,466
KELLY [INTERCOM]: I love you.

888
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:36,674
All right, I love you too.

889
01:03:36,778 --> 01:03:37,468
Bye.

890
01:03:52,207 --> 01:03:53,381
-Diane.
-Oh.

891
01:03:53,484 --> 01:03:54,382
What's wrong?

892
01:03:54,485 --> 01:03:55,486
Mr. Spanner, I'm sorry.

893
01:03:55,590 --> 01:03:56,833
I'll get to that
letter immediately.

894
01:03:56,936 --> 01:03:57,972
I'm not worried
about the letter.

895
01:03:58,075 --> 01:03:59,111
I'm worried about you.

896
01:03:59,214 --> 01:04:01,838
Oh Mr. Spanner, you're
such a good person.

897
01:04:01,941 --> 01:04:04,150
Next to God, I think
you're the nicest person

898
01:04:04,254 --> 01:04:04,944
in the whole world.

899
01:04:05,048 --> 01:04:06,843
I don't know about that.

900
01:04:06,946 --> 01:04:08,983
So you going to leave
me in suspense or what?

901
01:04:09,086 --> 01:04:12,365
Oh, it's this guy.

902
01:04:12,469 --> 01:04:14,851
I mean, he's really kind.

903
01:04:14,954 --> 01:04:16,369
He's intelligent.

904
01:04:16,473 --> 01:04:17,888
He's honest.

905
01:04:17,992 --> 01:04:20,166
I think I really love him.

906
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:22,306
So what's the problem?

907
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:26,793
He's just going too fast,
you know what I mean?

908
01:04:26,897 --> 01:04:29,313
I don't know, I just
finished school.

909
01:04:29,417 --> 01:04:31,212
I just started this new job.

910
01:04:31,315 --> 01:04:34,767
I'm just not ready
to go so fast.

911
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:38,667
Diane, I think it'll
work itself out.

912
01:04:38,771 --> 01:04:40,186
Thank you, Mr. Spanner.

913
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:41,015
Thank you.

914
01:04:41,118 --> 01:04:44,294
[ringing]

915
01:04:44,397 --> 01:04:45,364
Mr. Spanner's office.

916
01:04:45,467 --> 01:04:46,675
REHNQUIST [PHONE]:
This is John Rehnquist.

917
01:04:46,779 --> 01:04:48,574
One moment.

918
01:04:48,677 --> 01:04:49,540
It's Mr. Rehnquist.

919
01:04:49,644 --> 01:04:50,507
What?

920
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:53,096
Yeah.

921
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:54,166
Hello?

922
01:04:54,269 --> 01:04:55,339
REHNQUIST [PHONE]:
Is this Will Spanner?

923
01:04:55,443 --> 01:04:56,513
Yes, this is he.

924
01:04:56,616 --> 01:04:57,479
REHNQUIST [PHONE]: So
are you going to tell me

925
01:04:57,583 --> 01:04:58,722
what's going on?

926
01:04:58,825 --> 01:04:59,585
No, I'm not at liberty
to talk about your wife's

927
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:00,724
case, Mr. Rehnquist.

928
01:05:00,827 --> 01:05:01,898
REHNQUIST [PHONE]: Would
you change your mind

929
01:05:02,001 --> 01:05:03,037
if I mentioned a settlement?

930
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:04,555
What kind of settlement
are you talking about?

931
01:05:04,659 --> 01:05:05,729
REHNQUIST [PHONE]:
Not on the phone.

932
01:05:05,832 --> 01:05:06,833
I work at The Black Cat.

933
01:05:06,937 --> 01:05:08,249
All right, I'll see
you there in an hour.

934
01:05:40,522 --> 01:05:45,458
Might I suggest an
extremely dry vodka martini

935
01:05:45,562 --> 01:05:48,047
straight up with an olive?

936
01:05:48,151 --> 01:05:49,635
On the house, of course.

937
01:05:52,914 --> 01:05:55,192
Good evening, Mr. Spanner.

938
01:05:55,296 --> 01:05:59,300
So very nice to see the
face from behind the glass.

939
01:05:59,403 --> 01:06:00,266
Charles Savante.

940
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:03,476
What the hell are
you doing here?

941
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:05,892
I am the owner of
this establishment.

942
01:06:05,996 --> 01:06:10,069
The question is, what
are you doing here?

943
01:06:10,173 --> 01:06:12,899
I like an occasional
drink after work.

944
01:06:13,003 --> 01:06:16,834
Oh, I didn't realize
that you worked so late.

945
01:06:16,938 --> 01:06:18,767
Oh, I forget.

946
01:06:18,871 --> 01:06:21,978
You attorneys don't work
regular set shifts, do you?

947
01:06:22,081 --> 01:06:22,875
That's right.

948
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,359
We don't follow a time clock.

949
01:06:24,463 --> 01:06:26,879
Good for you.

950
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:31,780
It's almost a rather barbaric
notion, don't you think?

951
01:06:31,884 --> 01:06:37,269
Punch in, punch
out-- almost inhuman.

952
01:06:37,372 --> 01:06:39,581
Almost.

953
01:06:39,685 --> 01:06:42,481
So tell me the
truth, Mr. Spanner.

954
01:06:42,584 --> 01:06:45,484
What are you doing here?

955
01:06:45,587 --> 01:06:46,554
Looking for me?

956
01:06:46,657 --> 01:06:47,727
No.

957
01:06:47,831 --> 01:06:49,833
Actually, I'm here on
business with a client.

958
01:06:55,735 --> 01:06:58,048
Why hear, of all places?

959
01:06:58,152 --> 01:06:59,670
It's confidential.

960
01:06:59,774 --> 01:07:01,534
I'd prefer not to
talk about it anymore.

961
01:07:01,638 --> 01:07:03,778
Something tells me otherwise.

962
01:07:03,881 --> 01:07:04,572
Mmm?

963
01:07:04,675 --> 01:07:05,573
What's that?

964
01:07:05,676 --> 01:07:11,751
Oh, Let's just say
that I'm psychic.

965
01:07:11,855 --> 01:07:15,238
Are you psychic, Mr. Spanner?

966
01:07:36,121 --> 01:07:37,156
Lights are on.

967
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:39,055
She must be home.

968
01:07:39,158 --> 01:07:41,126
Wish me luck.

969
01:07:41,229 --> 01:07:41,919
Luck.

970
01:07:48,616 --> 01:07:50,376
Where's the syringe?

971
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,688
You have it.

972
01:07:51,791 --> 01:07:54,070
It's not in here.

973
01:07:54,173 --> 01:07:54,863
God damn it.

974
01:07:54,967 --> 01:07:55,933
It's in my purse.

975
01:07:56,037 --> 01:07:57,452
I left it at Spanner's office.

976
01:07:57,556 --> 01:07:58,281
You what?

977
01:07:58,384 --> 01:07:59,282
You can be so stupid--

978
01:07:59,385 --> 01:08:01,042
Shut up!

979
01:08:01,146 --> 01:08:02,457
Just go make sure
she doesn't leave.

980
01:08:02,561 --> 01:08:06,461
I'll go get it.

981
01:08:06,565 --> 01:08:07,462
Go on!

982
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,278
Well, I'm sorry.

983
01:09:04,381 --> 01:09:07,281
But if you can't respect
the way I feel about this,

984
01:09:07,384 --> 01:09:08,696
then maybe we should break up.

985
01:09:11,837 --> 01:09:12,596
OK, fine.

986
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:14,115
Then maybe we should break up.

987
01:09:17,532 --> 01:09:18,395
I forgot my purse.

988
01:09:18,499 --> 01:09:20,156
Oh, I have it, Mrs. Rehnquist.

989
01:09:20,259 --> 01:09:21,571
You never left your number.

990
01:09:21,674 --> 01:09:23,918
I would've called you.

991
01:09:24,021 --> 01:09:25,885
What an exquisite ring.

992
01:09:25,989 --> 01:09:27,128
Thank you.

993
01:09:27,232 --> 01:09:28,819
I don't believe I've ever
seen one quite like it.

994
01:09:28,923 --> 01:09:30,718
Ah, yeah, it's my
graduation ring.

995
01:09:30,821 --> 01:09:32,271
I just graduated
from Sacred Heart.

996
01:09:32,375 --> 01:09:33,893
You don't say?

997
01:09:33,997 --> 01:09:35,516
Have you kept all of your vows?

998
01:09:35,619 --> 01:09:36,344
Excuse me.

999
01:09:36,448 --> 01:09:37,656
The vows of the church.

1000
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:39,554
There are so few of us
who are strong enough

1001
01:09:39,658 --> 01:09:40,555
not to break them.

1002
01:09:40,659 --> 01:09:42,488
Yeah, well, my
boyfriend sure wishes

1003
01:09:42,592 --> 01:09:45,146
I would break one of those
vows, if you know what I mean.

1004
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:47,562
I think I do, my dear.

1005
01:09:47,666 --> 01:09:51,463
I think I do.

1006
01:09:51,566 --> 01:09:55,052
You know, I don't believe
in any of that shit.

1007
01:09:55,156 --> 01:09:58,504
Psychic, supernatural,
extraterrestrial,

1008
01:09:58,608 --> 01:10:00,955
astrological, I don't
believe any of it.

1009
01:10:01,058 --> 01:10:03,371
Oh, but Will.

1010
01:10:03,475 --> 01:10:08,065
That's so cynical and so untrue.

1011
01:10:08,169 --> 01:10:10,447
Surely you realize
that there are

1012
01:10:10,551 --> 01:10:16,867
certain people who are chosen
to possess such abilities.

1013
01:10:16,971 --> 01:10:20,457
You know, I got to get going.

1014
01:10:20,561 --> 01:10:22,390
Does this subject
make you uncomfortable?

1015
01:10:22,494 --> 01:10:24,565
No, you make me uncomfortable.

1016
01:10:29,501 --> 01:10:32,158
Tell me, Mr. Spanner.

1017
01:10:32,262 --> 01:10:36,093
Have you ever used
any of your powers?

1018
01:10:36,197 --> 01:10:38,026
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1019
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:40,270
Come, come, Mr. Spanner.

1020
01:10:40,374 --> 01:10:43,273
I am an informed citizen.

1021
01:10:43,377 --> 01:10:45,517
I do read the papers.

1022
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:51,281
I seem to recall some
articles from some time ago

1023
01:10:51,385 --> 01:10:57,977
involving you with activities of
the supernatural, so to speak.

1024
01:10:58,081 --> 01:10:59,151
Surely you don't
believe everything

1025
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,981
you read in the papers.

1026
01:11:02,085 --> 01:11:04,260
Not everything.

1027
01:11:04,363 --> 01:11:07,815
But some things--
I seem to recall

1028
01:11:07,918 --> 01:11:14,753
these articles being buried in
the back of the second section.

1029
01:11:14,856 --> 01:11:16,755
I wonder how you managed that.

1030
01:11:16,858 --> 01:11:19,792
You know, I'd say this
was a pleasure if it were.

1031
01:11:24,418 --> 01:11:28,422
If I were you, I'd
hurry home, Mr. Spanner.

1032
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:02,973
REPORTER [RADIO]: In
other news, a fifth girl

1033
01:12:03,077 --> 01:12:04,803
has been found murdered
in the Hollywood Hills.

1034
01:12:04,906 --> 01:12:07,495
The police believe the killings
are religiously motivated

1035
01:12:07,599 --> 01:12:09,670
and are warning all
women to lock their doors

1036
01:12:09,773 --> 01:12:11,119
and stay inside.

1037
01:12:11,223 --> 01:12:13,536
And tonight, astronomers
all over the world

1038
01:12:13,639 --> 01:12:16,124
will be out in full force as
the lunar eclipse approaches.

1039
01:13:30,889 --> 01:13:33,270
You all right, honey?

1040
01:13:33,374 --> 01:13:34,271
All right.

1041
01:13:48,009 --> 01:13:48,907
MAN: Shit.

1042
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:50,218
WOMAN: What happened
to your hand?

1043
01:13:50,322 --> 01:13:52,704
MAN: She stabbed me with a
pair of fucking scissors.

1044
01:13:52,807 --> 01:13:53,705
WOMAN: Ouch!

1045
01:13:53,808 --> 01:13:54,464
MAN: Not funny.

1046
01:14:01,816 --> 01:14:03,300
Guess what?

1047
01:14:03,404 --> 01:14:05,061
That wasn't our girl.

1048
01:14:05,164 --> 01:14:06,165
I've got our girl.

1049
01:14:06,269 --> 01:14:08,651
She's in the trunk--
Spanner's secretary

1050
01:14:08,754 --> 01:14:10,446
fresh out of convent school.

1051
01:14:10,549 --> 01:14:11,792
You're kidding.

1052
01:14:11,895 --> 01:14:15,347
Let's hope she kept her vows.

1053
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:16,969
Oh, my poor baby.

1054
01:15:02,843 --> 01:15:03,878
What's wrong?

1055
01:15:03,982 --> 01:15:06,605
Call Lutz and tell him
to meet me at my office.

1056
01:15:06,709 --> 01:15:07,882
Don't go.

1057
01:15:07,986 --> 01:15:10,816
Lock these doors and don't
let anybody in, all right?

1058
01:16:00,659 --> 01:16:02,143
We have to get moving.

1059
01:16:02,247 --> 01:16:03,179
There's no more time to waste.

1060
01:16:03,282 --> 01:16:04,352
Well, I'm sorry.

1061
01:16:04,456 --> 01:16:06,872
I just wanted to relieve
some of this tension.

1062
01:16:06,976 --> 01:16:09,288
Of course you did, and
I rather enjoyed it.

1063
01:16:09,392 --> 01:16:11,049
But we have to get going.

1064
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:22,163
I came as fast as I could.

1065
01:16:22,267 --> 01:16:23,440
What the hell happened here?

1066
01:16:23,544 --> 01:16:24,890
Well, let's just say
the unfaithful husband

1067
01:16:24,994 --> 01:16:28,376
I've been tailing is also the
same psycho you're looking for.

1068
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:29,619
Jesus.

1069
01:16:29,723 --> 01:16:31,725
And he works for a woman
who calls herself Rehnquist.

1070
01:16:31,828 --> 01:16:34,693
Yeah, my guess is they're
both working for Savante.

1071
01:16:34,797 --> 01:16:35,798
Are you sure about this?

1072
01:16:35,901 --> 01:16:37,800
Lutz, they've
taken my secretary.

1073
01:16:37,903 --> 01:16:39,180
Christ.

1074
01:16:39,284 --> 01:16:40,596
I bet they're at The Black Cat.

1075
01:16:40,699 --> 01:16:41,804
No.

1076
01:16:41,907 --> 01:16:43,495
They've got to be at the
highest point of the city.

1077
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:46,325
They've-- they've got to be as
close to the moon as possible.

1078
01:16:46,429 --> 01:16:47,706
Then there's only one
place they could be.

1079
01:17:02,479 --> 01:17:09,210
She's rather
sultry for a virgin.

1080
01:17:09,314 --> 01:17:13,559
I've spent my miserable
life with mortals.

1081
01:17:13,663 --> 01:17:16,355
Tonight, I shall serve
at the side of Satan.

1082
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:07,130
She is the one.

1083
01:18:32,155 --> 01:18:34,157
Oh man, the only eclipse
in my lifetime and I

1084
01:18:34,261 --> 01:18:34,951
got to be on duty.

1085
01:18:35,055 --> 01:18:36,125
[scream]

1086
01:18:36,228 --> 01:18:36,953
You hear that?

1087
01:18:37,057 --> 01:18:37,747
Let's separate.

1088
01:18:37,851 --> 01:18:38,748
I'll go this way.

1089
01:18:47,343 --> 01:18:50,104
You have been of
great service to me.

1090
01:18:56,697 --> 01:18:58,492
I no longer need your service.

1091
01:19:28,004 --> 01:19:30,904
Our master will be so pleased.

1092
01:19:31,007 --> 01:19:35,978
We'll finally have a mistress
worthy of his esteem.

1093
01:19:36,081 --> 01:19:39,429
Prepare the sacrifice.

1094
01:19:39,533 --> 01:19:41,569
And do not disturb me.

1095
01:20:20,988 --> 01:20:24,785
I really wouldn't do that if
I were you, Mrs. Rehnquist.

1096
01:20:24,889 --> 01:20:26,166
Besides, it may
just hurt your case.

1097
01:20:26,269 --> 01:20:27,408
Hello, William.

1098
01:20:27,512 --> 01:20:29,134
It's a little late for
heroics, don't you think?

1099
01:20:29,238 --> 01:20:30,549
Get out of my way.

1100
01:20:34,484 --> 01:20:35,554
Get out of my way.

1101
01:20:35,658 --> 01:20:36,693
Oh, what are you going to do?

1102
01:20:36,797 --> 01:20:39,696
Tear my pretty head off
my pretty shoulders?

1103
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:40,559
That's a thought.

1104
01:20:43,217 --> 01:20:44,909
Now you sound like one of us.

1105
01:20:45,012 --> 01:20:46,738
You are one of us, Will.

1106
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:48,740
You can't fight the
prince of darkness.

1107
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:50,707
It'll always be
stronger than you.

1108
01:20:50,811 --> 01:20:52,813
Let it in, darling.

1109
01:20:52,917 --> 01:20:53,779
Let it in.

1110
01:21:09,588 --> 01:21:11,625
You're getting
excited, Mr. Spanner.

1111
01:21:11,728 --> 01:21:13,869
The thought of killing
you does that to me.

1112
01:21:13,972 --> 01:21:15,318
I don't think so.

1113
01:21:15,422 --> 01:21:19,115
I think your body's saying yes
and your mind is saying no.

1114
01:21:19,219 --> 01:21:20,530
I always listen
to my body, Will.

1115
01:21:20,634 --> 01:21:22,084
It makes for a much better time.

1116
01:21:22,187 --> 01:21:23,499
Speak for yourself.

1117
01:21:23,602 --> 01:21:25,673
I speak for both of us, Will.

1118
01:21:25,777 --> 01:21:27,330
We're both the same.

1119
01:21:27,434 --> 01:21:28,814
Our bodies belong
to Satan forever.

1120
01:22:24,594 --> 01:22:25,285
Freeze!

1121
01:22:51,207 --> 01:22:52,795
I can't believe I got
lost in the woods.

1122
01:22:52,898 --> 01:22:53,796
I can.

1123
01:22:53,899 --> 01:22:56,454
DIANE: Mr. Spanner?

1124
01:22:56,557 --> 01:22:59,353
It's been great working
for you, but I quit.

1125
01:22:59,457 --> 01:23:01,252
Uh oh.

1126
01:23:01,355 --> 01:23:02,632
Hey, don't look at me.

1127
01:23:02,736 --> 01:23:03,737
Can't say as I blame her.

1128
01:23:21,858 --> 01:23:23,550
So what do you say
we do now, counselor?

1129
01:23:23,653 --> 01:23:25,552
Feel like seeing a movie?

1130
01:23:25,655 --> 01:23:26,794
Nah, too much violence.

1131
01:23:26,898 --> 01:23:29,314
Yeah.

1132
01:23:29,418 --> 01:23:31,937
Sure could go for
some doughnuts, though.

1133
01:23:32,041 --> 01:23:34,043
What am I going to
do with you, Lutz?

1134
01:23:34,147 --> 01:23:35,527
Let's get out of here.

1135
01:24:05,074 --> 01:24:06,696
The

1136
01:24:43,595 --> 01:25:43,517
thank you and then and the on
and I did not die rest of you.
