(mumbles)

43
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,520
- What do you think, probably twenty miles to the border?

44
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,260
- Something like that.

45
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,960
- What do I smell, fear?

46
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,430
Are you scared, bitch?

47
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,430

Hey dog, that's for real.

this is your best, lost in the desert.

83

- You see those cliffs?

84
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,360
There could be water up there.

85
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,760
- (chuckles) Yeah, or a long march to the death.

86
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,470

- Yeah, so what you digging for?

90
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,670
- There are pools underground.

91
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,840
Sometimes it collects in the mud holes.

92
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,780
- I dig to the fucking China to get some water out of there.

93
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:32,680
- Dig for me too.

94
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,920

95
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,720

96
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,850

Give me that!

104
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,810
- It's a Jesuit cross, ancient scripture.

105
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,110
- What do you mean, scripture?

106
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,780
Like Bible, Koran, shit like that?

107
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,180

108
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,150

112
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,530
I'm Jesus, come on, let's walk.

113
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,040

Old man!

128
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,950
Which way is to the border, the Mexico border?

129
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,920
You speak English?

130
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,790
- Do you speak Apache?

131
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,200
Trade for water.

132
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,740
Trade for water.

133
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,150
Ah.

134
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,780
You seek Tumacacori?

135
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,950
- What? - Tumacacori, lost gold.

136
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,660
- What the hell is this fool talking about, man?

137
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,990
Seriously, what's up?

138
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,890
- You wish to return the medallion.

139
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,660
- We're looking for the border.

140
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,900
- (sighs) I ain't looking for no border, man.

141
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,160
You got something to eat, some food?

142
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,030
- Plenty food.

143
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,270
Plenty food.

144
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,500
- Some damn snakes, man.

145
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,770
I ain't eatin' that.

146
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,370
- You a real Indian?

147
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,640
(frightening music)

148
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:01,920

(laughing)

150
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,000
- What'd he start singing?

151
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:13,900
- He started singing a death chant, man.

152
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,200
- He must've seen something.

153
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,770
Nah, but he's singing that we're all gonna die and shit,

154
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,840
you know what I'm saying?

155
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,780
- Come on, let's eat.

156
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,840
- I heard those things tastes like chicken!

157
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,480
- Let me get some of that right quick, dog.

158
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,080
- Shit ain't half bad.

159
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,420
- Nah, nah, nah.

160
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,720
Wash it off a little bit though, you know what I mean?

161
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,990
- Fuck that shit. - Fuck it.

162
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,020
Eat it dirty.

163
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,030
- So why haven't you made your break?

164
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,730
- Safety in numbers.

165
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,970
Until we get to the border.

166
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,010
You alright?

167
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,240
- Yeah, I'm fine.

168
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,060
- I will tell you the legend of Tumacacori,

169
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,990
the story of the lost gold.

170
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,160
- You talking about treasure?

171
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,800
- Seven mummies and seven gold medallions.

172
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,010
The directorio of Tumacacori

173
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,050
has been known for over 500 years,

174
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,950
since the Spanish first enslaved the Hohokoham people,

175
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,350
and forced them to free the treasure

176
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,790
from the Guachapa Mountains.

177
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,290
Below the mountain pass were twelve arrastas

178
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,730
and twelve patias.

179
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,000
The arrastas were used to crush the ore,

180
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,970
and the patias were used to screen the mountain clay

181
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,310
from the gold before crossing the wild river.

182
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,540
The treasure was hidden deep in the vast desert.

183
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,950
And seven Jesuit priests were sworn

184
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,980
to protect the secret location.

185
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,020
For almost 400 years no one came.

186
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:16,930
Then a small town was built over the site

187
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,130
where the white man came to dig in the desert.

188
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,700
The town still stands,

189
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,170
a place that can only be found

190
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,570
when the day and the night are of equal length

191
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,210
everywhere at once.

192
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,380
Return the seventh medallion and there will be more gold

193
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:42,520
than 10 men can spend in 10 lifetimes together.

194
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,120
- What?

195
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,890
- Hey, dog, what's this fool talking about, man, seriously?

196
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,220
- I don't know.

197
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,860
- Border is that way,

198
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,830
gold is that way.

199
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,830
- I'm with the gold, homie.

200
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,700
(smacks hands) I'm out.

201
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,170
(laughing)

202
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,220
(eerie music)

203
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,340
(gunshots blasting)

204
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,160
- I'm not dying!

205
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,830
I'm not!

206
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:12,930
(thuds) Stop following me!

207
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,740
(screaming)

208
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,570
(gunshot blasts)

209
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,280
(breathing heavily)

210
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:48,340
(gunshots blasting)

211
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,220
(shouting)

212
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,220
(whimpering)

213
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,460
- Crazy old man was right.

214
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,260
- Hey dog, we finally ran into a town.

215
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,960
Hey, let's go get the gold, yo.

216
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,360
- Wait, just wait.

217
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,330
Everybody gets equal splits,

218
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,240
except for I'm taking Blade's share.

219
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,370
- Hell no, you not, dog!

220
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,640
- I'm not feeling that, homeboy.

221
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,270
- Hey, this ain't a democracy!

222
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,240
You two got a problem with that?

223
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:04,250
- As long as we make us rich, I don't give a fuck.

224
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,510
Better just quit your bitching, homie.

225
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,120
- And I guess you don't have a problem?

226
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:14,420
(dramatic music)

227
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,490
(horse whinnies)

228
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,200
- It's always like that just before it drops.

229
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,240
You, uh, just get in town?

230
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,050
Saloon's the best place to be till after dark.

231
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,280
Name's Kile.

232
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,100
Come on in, I'll show you around.

233
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,440
- Shit, you ain't gotta tell me twice.

234
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,670
- You got pinot grigio? - You got tequila?

235
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,570
What's up?

236
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:20,110
(Old Western piano music) (chattering)

237
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,580
- What's popping?

238
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:27,520
Ooh!

239
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,590
God damn, that shit looks tasty!

240
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,610
(glass shattering)

241
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,910
- This'll work!

242
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,040
- Let's sit down and have a drink, dog,

243
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,450
you know what I mean?

244
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,610
- Let's kick it. - I'm thirsty.

245
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,620
- Here, sit, yo.

246
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:35,020
- [Patron] Shit, he's got one of my flavors. (laughs)

247
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,260
- Compliments of the house.

248
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:41,230
First and last one's always free.

249
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,330
- I'll drink to that. - Hell yeah.

250
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,830
Fill 'em up with that one.

251
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,640
- Here's a little meat to put on your bones., ma'am.

252
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:53,510
First and last one, always free.

253
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:03,850
- Hey, sir, sir, Bartender, I like this girl over here.

254
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,420
- I'd die to see this one here.

255
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:06,920
She looks like Maria, the bitch I was telling you about

256
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,920
back home, you know what I mean?

257
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:12,190
(suspenseful music)

258
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:13,860
- Stay calm.

259
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,780
- Ma'am.

260
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,680
So how you boys doing?

261
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,430
Any of you fellas see that sign out there,

262
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:50,460
the one that says I got to register you're here in the town

263
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,230
before you get all kinda settled in?

264
00:26:55,570 --> 00:27:00,840
- Well, we're new in town, and I didn't see no sign.

265
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,580
(hammer clicks)

266
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,650
- Well, that's the law,

267
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,020
Sheriff's order.

268
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,560
- Let's arrest 'em, Cap!

269
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,390
(hammers clicking) Let's kill the fuckers.

270
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:22,660
- Mr. Drake, that bright sun was truly blinding.

271
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,470
Why don't we give our young visitors here

272
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,410
some time to adjust to our generous civil behavior?

273
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,450
(laughing)

274
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:40,780
- The light was low on our face.

275
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,480
Ain't that right, baby, hmm?

276
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:54,730
- That sound about right to you?

277
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,770
You couldn't see nothing, that's right?

278
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,770
(sniffs)

279
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,440
I believe

280
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,780
I smell bullshit.

281
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:13,080
(laughing)

282
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:20,320
Funny thing, bullshit, thieves, liars,

283
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,860
they all kind of smell the same.

284
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:28,700
So I say to you, I say seek not

285
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:34,500
the plunder that is buried in the evil earth.

286
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:37,970
No, no, no, I say to you,

287
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,740
I say lay up your riches in heaven!

288
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,810
(laughing)

289
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,820
However,

290
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,830
I must confess,

291
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:04,270
I surely do love

292
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,100
and believe in a beautiful woman.

293
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:16,380
Love pretty ladies. (laughing)

294
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,780
I surely do

295
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,750
believe pretty ladies.

296
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,150
(kisses)

297
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:31,630
Gentlemen, welcome to our little community.

298
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,660
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

299
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,330
Welcome to our little community. (laughs maniacally)

300
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,170
You know what I say?

301
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:45,640
I say that you're to enjoy the nice warm hospitality

302
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,040
of our little town here.

303
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,610
I say to you,

304
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:54,150
drink all of these cold libations that you can!

305
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,450
I say to you,

306
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:00,920
to just simply take anything that you desire,

307
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:05,890
because the darkness will be upon us,

308
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,030
soon enough.

309
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:14,030
(hammers click)

310
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,850
- That's some trippy shit, dog, you know what I mean?

311
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,250
They didn't even take us in and we got this shit on.

312
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,720
- It's all for the show.

313
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,620
A beer.

314
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,810
- This dickhead's gonna get laid before us?

315
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,480
- No, no, no. I don't know about you, dog,

316
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,550
but I'm gettin' me a cowgirl or some shit, homie.

317
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,850
- Yeah, I gotta get my boogie on.

318
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,480
What's up, homie don't fuck around.

319
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,030
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Pops, get over here.

320
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:14,730
Bend over!

321
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,300
- [Wallet] Get me at the bar, homeboys.

322
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,000
- Man, don't ever trip, Wallet, I got you, homie.

323
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,700
Let me get my mack on first, you know what I saying?

324
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,500
What's your name, girl?

325
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:24,740
Anna, it's that way?

326
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,070
I'm gonna go with Maria, all right?

327
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:26,970
And we'll keep it Mexican.

328
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,110
- Don't hold back on account of me.

329
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,980
- I don't fuck whores.

330
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,090
I'm not interested in lying.

331
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:38,990
Hey,

332
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,560
you move again,

333
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,590
and I gonna blow your stomach all over that wall.

334
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,840
(growling)

335
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,250
- Take me with you!

336
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,840
(coyote howling)

337
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:36,040
(upbeat hip-hop music)

338
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:16,650
25 years, murder, I wasn't supposed to get none of this!

339
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,920
(moaning) (breathing heavily)

340
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,100
Ron Jeremy aint got shit on me!

341
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:33,370
(screaming) (moaning loudly)

342
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,110
They didn't have none of this in C block.

343
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,720
- Mm, you taste good.

344
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:57,960
(ominous music)

345
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:19,750
(demonic howling)

346
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:22,150
(screams)

347
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,240
(yells)

348
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,170
- What the--

349
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,170
Oh, shit!

350
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,440
(groaning)

351
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,220
(growling)

352
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,430
(thuds)

353
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,500
(gasps)

354
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:17,770
(demonically growling)

355
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,210
(grunting)

356
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:33,820
- Get off!

357
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:36,190
(shotgun blasts)

358
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,460
- Fuck!

359
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,360
Fuck that.

360
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,700
(shotgun blasts) (groans)

361
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,230
(growling)

362
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,770
(growls demonically)

363
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,540
(screaming)

364
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,440
(shotgun blasting)

365
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:05,050
(slams)

366
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,340
(glass shatters)

367
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,900
- Can't kill us all.

368
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,270
(gunshot blasts)

369
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:28,080
(chuckles) The first one's always free.

370
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,180
Now, the second one's gonna cost you.

371
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,950
(shotgun blasts)

372
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,280
- Keep the change.

373
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,450
(demonically growling)

374
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,300
(screaming)

375
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,340
(glass shattering)

376
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,910
- Fuck!

377
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,080
(shotgun blasting)

378
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,430
- Over here, come on!

379
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,930
Just hurry, come on!

380
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,200
(gunshots blasting)

381
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,410
- Take the gun!

382
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,910
(moaning)

383
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,590
(grunts)

384
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,090
- Motherfucker gave me an empty gun.

385
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:54,560
(yells in pain)

386
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,660
- Fucking hooker.

387
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,670
(groaning)

388
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,080
Shit!

389
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,980
Fucking should've went with the little-tittie white girl.

390
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:47,610
(spooky music)

391
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:07,270
(door bangs)

392
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,210
- Come on!

393
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,780
Hurry! (panting)

394
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,450
Follow me, come on.

395
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:31,190
(whimpering) - Everybody get down.

396
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,690
What the hell was that, man?

397
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,830
I've ain't never seen no show like that before, ese.

398
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:35,200
- Shh, quiet!

399
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,530
(whimpering)

400
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,200
- Tell me everything you fucking know.

401
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:43,040
- Maybe she don't know nothing.

402
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,410
- You shut the fuck up.

403
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,510
She knows.

404
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:50,040
(grunting)

405
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,050
- Fuck, I wish I was back in jail.

406
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,820
- Hey, that's Wallet.

407
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:02,460
That's Wally outside, look.

408
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,390
Come here, check it out.

409
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,500
(bell rings)

410
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,040
- Santos? - What's up?

411
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,140
- [Rock] Go out there and get him.

412
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,810
- (chuckles) Fuck that!

413
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,180
You go there and get his ass, man!

414
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,250
Get on that good shit.

415
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,420
Fuck you, dog.

416
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,490
You go out there and get eaten by some fucking goblin.

417
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,120
(grunting)

418
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:36,090
(horse whinnies)

419
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,440
(splatters)

420
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,170
- Oh my God. - Oh shit!

421
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,440
What the fuck was that shit?

422
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,310
- What the fuck is this?

423
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,980
- [Rock] We gotta find that gold.

424
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,580
(sobbing)

425
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:00,310
We need to get the gold and get the fuck out of this town.

426
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,050
- What are you, crazy? They're trying to eat us alive!

427
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,050
Fuck the gold!

428
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,650
- Really, Travis? Hmm?

429
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,190
You and me, Travis,

430
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,260
are gonna go get the gold together, understand?

431
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:14,560
- He killed the others!

432
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,360
He kept me alive.

433
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,900
Wanted me to help him find the other medallions.

434
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:23,470
He promised me he wouldn't hurt me.

435
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,880
(clattering)

436
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,380
(screams)

437
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,010
- What the fuck is this shit, huh?

438
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,780
What the fuck is that, man?

439
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:35,920
What fuck is that?

440
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,120
Let's go! (whimpering)

441
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,190
- Shit!

442
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,120
- No!

443
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,360
No, no, no.!

444
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:48,830
(spooky music)

445
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:55,240
(gunshots blasting) (screaming)

446
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,940
- Keep fucking moving!

447
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,840
Move!

448
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,740
Shit!

449
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:29,540
- What the fuck, man!

450
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,400
It's all fucking dust, man!

451
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:35,340
- Oh my God. - What?

452
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,410
Hey, that's all us in that picture, man!

453
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,880
- Nothing, it's only an illusion.

454
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,490
- [Santos] What the fuck you mean an illusion, man?

455
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:47,450
I don't know where you come from, dog,

456
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,020
but where I'm from, man,

457
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:51,160
I ain't never seen no dead people walking, talkin' shit,

458
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,760
and get up and chase us.

459
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,760
- There's gotta be something inside one of these buildings.

460
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:56,360
- Well, that's good.

461
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:58,570
Why don't we find it and get the fuck on out of here, man?

462
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:01,370
You better shut the fuck up, ese.

463
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:02,700
Ever since you took us here, man,

464
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:04,570
you've been fucking shit up, dog.

465
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,710
Hey, where we going, huh?

466
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,440
I mean, we walk in here, we walk in there,

467
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:13,210
we don't even know-- - Santos!

468
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,550
You and the Lone Ranger go check out upstairs.

469
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:20,420
- Man, I don't even care no more, dog.

470
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:22,290
I want to get this shit over with, dog.

471
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,660
Let's go get this shit and get the fuck...

472
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:27,360
(laughs) Fuck all that, man.

473
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:31,460
- We're here for the gold, remember?

474
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:35,700
- I'll go with him.

475
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,310
- Fucking put your hands on me again, dog.

476
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:42,410
- You know what?

477
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:44,710
This way.

478
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,580
- You guys are all trippin'.

479
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,980
If you didn't have that gun, homie...

480
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:52,420
- Yeah? What?

481
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:53,750
- You wouldn't be so fucking brave, ese.

482
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,520
- Okay, you think so? - I know so.

483
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:57,820
- Hear that?

484
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,700
(spooky music)

485
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:31,760
- I'm gonna check our right here, dog, and see what's up.

486
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:40,900
This shit's empty, dog.

487
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,340
Ain't nothing in there, man.

488
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,900
Come on, homie, let's be for real, man.

489
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:45,540
It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack.

490
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:46,570
There ain't a shit out here, let's roll.

491
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,310
- Yeah, a golden needle.

492
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:42,060
- Pretty weird town, huh?

493
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:49,700
Pretty weird town.

494
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:51,870
- You don't know the half of it.

495
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,010
(chuckles)

496
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:57,610
- I shot myself in the foot.

497
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:02,750
Say hello to my little friend.

498
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:10,960
What do you make of this?

499
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,970
That's not all I found.

500
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,540
(roaring) (growling)

501
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,950
- What's your hurry?

502
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,150
(screaming)

503
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,930
Did you get yourself lost?

504
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,670
See ya in hell, you son of a bitch.

505
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:57,840
(dings) (gunshot blasts)

506
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,930
- [Lacy] Aw, shit! Fuck!

507
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,900
- Over here, come on.

508
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:43,750
(suspenseful music)

509
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:06,770
(footsteps tapping)

510
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:14,550
(door creaks)

511
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:51,020
(door bangs)

512
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,940
- No shit, this town is fucking haunted.

513
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:17,210
- Come on, let's go.

514
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:32,590
(door clatters)

515
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:34,090
- This shit's locked man.

516
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,800
(banging)

517
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,360
- How about now?

518
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:39,230
- Nah, we good now.

519
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:40,100
Let's go.

520
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:48,880
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

521
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:51,080
Rock, come check this out, dog.

522
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:53,880
- [Rock] What?

523
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:27,810
- What's that?

524
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:30,950
- ck] Looks like a map.

525
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,190
- The fuck all this shit say here on the bottom, man?

526
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:35,890
- Come on, let's go.

527
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:57,140
(whistling)

528
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:09,060
- Don't run.

529
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:16,460
(clicks)

530
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,430
We got all night.

531
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,840
(heavy rock music)

532
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:15,290
(sighs)

533
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:16,490
- This is crazy.

534
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:19,390
It goes on forever.

535
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,470
- If we get out of here, what's gonna happen.

536
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,340
- You can trust me.

537
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:54,760
- So I say to you,

538
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:56,500
I say seek not the plunder

539
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,530
that's buried under the weakened earth.

540
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:03,540
No, no, no, I say to you, seek treasures in heaven.

541
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:10,280
- How do you get out of this town?

542
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:17,380
- Come with me.

543
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:45,110
- Oh, we got light.

544
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,180
Oh, nice!

545
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:55,220
(door creaks) (ominous music)

546
00:53:58,590 --> 00:53:59,990
- Heard you was leaving.

547
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,400
- Now, that ain't polite.

548
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,350
- I brought them just like you asked.

549
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:26,450
- Where is the medallion?

550
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,750
- What?

551
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:29,890
- The gold coin? - They've got it.

552
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:37,460
- The seven must be together again as one, Amen.

553
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:39,330
- You don't understand. - I know they've got it.

554
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,370
- We never had it!

555
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:45,170
- Why do you lie to me, child?

556
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,940
- I brought them just like you asked!

557
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:48,210
- You stupid bitch.

558
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:50,640
- But you leave me, bitch!

559
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:52,480
- They took it!

560
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:53,510
I know they did.

561
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:54,550
- We don't want any trouble.

562
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:56,350
We just want to leave town.

563
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:58,990
- That's what they always say, every time,

564
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:00,420
right before they die.

565
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:01,820
- Just tell them where you put it.

566
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:03,990
- I told you, we don't have it!

567
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:07,390
(sword scraping)

568
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:09,960
- Seven coins,

569
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:14,930
seven priests, one medallion one priest,

570
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,300
that's the way it's always been,

571
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:19,240
and the way it's always will be.

572
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:24,610
This here gold was forged in the very fires of hell.

573
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:25,610
(door creaking)

574
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,180
(door thuds)

575
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:31,950
If you hold the seven

576
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,620
together as one,

577
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:38,190
then you hold in your hand the mystery

578
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:43,230
and the power of the treasure in all its glory.

579
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:45,130
Oh, girl!

580
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:51,700
You should have told me where the medallion was.

581
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:57,440
(screams)

582
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:59,280
(thuds)

583
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:00,580
Next.

584
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:01,450
- Run!

585
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,820
(grunting)

586
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,750
(gunshot blasts)

587
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:07,620
- Come on, Lacy!

588
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:09,360
Come on, let's go!

589
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:17,560
Get up! Come on!

590
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:28,470
(sword scrapes)

591
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,610
(moaning)

592
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,750
My leg. (grunting)

593
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:36,020
Where we going?

594
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,420
- Oh yes, my sweet,

595
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,190
lost soul's confession.

596
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,690
Our city's clean.

597
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,500
- [Santos] I can't go on, man.

598
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:56,340
I'm good, I'm good right here.

599
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,500
(grunting)

600
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:14,050
(breathing heavily)

601
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:19,690
- [Travis] Hey Rock, where the fuck we are going, man?

602
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,760
- [Santos] That's it, man.

603
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:22,600
I'm good, I'm good right here.

604
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:23,960
- That's right.

605
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:28,300
Now even your children's children shall have need

606
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:30,270
of the Lord's blessing.

607
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:38,540
- I gotta fucking rest, man.

608
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:39,910
Whole lot faster.

609
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,850
I can't fucking go on, man.

610
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:42,720
Oh, shit!

611
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:47,020
- Hey listen, you need to give 'em back that medallion.

612
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:50,720
- Look, you need to shut the fuck up and tend to him, now!

613
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:51,620
- Hey Rock!

614
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,330
We're going around in circles, man.

615
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:57,560
You got a plan?

616
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:02,230
- I got a map.

617
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:05,740
- He's got a map.

618
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,710
Come on, let's get out of here.

619
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:14,550
Come on.

620
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:15,580
- Fuck!

621
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,580
- Come on, let's go.

622
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:22,660
Oh, man.

623
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,760
(grunting)

624
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,670
(laughing maniacally)

625
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:44,410
(ominous music)

626
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,460
(gunshot blasts)

627
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:04,730
(church bell rings)

628
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:10,060
- [Lacy] What is it?

629
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:11,430
- It's a diary.

630
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:15,670
Jesuit priests would record their dead

631
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:17,970
before they buried them under the church.

632
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:22,840
- Like a crypt? - Exactly.

633
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:26,980
- Turn this.

634
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,720
(creaking)

635
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:48,500
(grunts) It's locked.

636
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:50,800
Again.

637
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:03,750
(otherworldly music)

638
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,770
Give me the flashlight.

639
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:34,380
(breathing heavily)

640
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:38,680
(grunting)

641
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:46,960
- Come on!

642
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:49,930
We gotta get the gold, man.

643
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,330
(yells in pain) Okay.

644
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:47,790
I can't go on, man.

645
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:50,220
- Bullshit, move! - Come on, come on!

646
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:53,930
- [Travis] We'll fuckin' leave your ass, now move it!

647
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,990
(eerie music)

648
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:44,910
- Shit!

649
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:47,810
My fucking legs are killing me, man.

650
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,650
You think we should open this shit?

651
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:53,650
Come on.

652
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:54,650
The gold might be inside here or something,

653
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,390
you know what I mean?

654
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:59,390
(hinge creaking)

655
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:00,490
Damn!

656
01:04:08,530 --> 01:04:10,040
- [Lacy] Oh Jesus!

657
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:13,940
- Looks like a fucking monster.

658
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:19,510
Hey, do you think he's lasted?

659
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:24,950
Let's pick his ass up.

660
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:37,000
- I gotta rest, man. - Sit down, man.

661
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:44,800
(groaning)

662
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:55,710
(wood creaking) (grunting)

663
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:00,090
(cracks) (ghostly music)

664
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:00,990
- Oh shit!

665
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:07,390
The fucking gold, man!

666
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:09,090
The fucking gold, man!

667
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,000
I'm rich.

668
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:12,000
What's up?

669
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,100
What's up with...

670
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:15,530
What, you guys don't want none of this?

671
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,540
(laughing)

672
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:19,640
I'm rich.

673
01:05:21,470 --> 01:05:22,240
We hit the jackpot, man.

674
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:23,140
We're rich!

675
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,150
(laughing)

676
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:46,030
Rich, dog!

677
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:51,040
(gasps)

678
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:55,640
(grunting)

679
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:58,040
(slamming)

680
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:02,150
- Oh my God.

681
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:03,180
- Come on!

682
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:05,350
Let's get out of here, Lacy!

683
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:10,060
(growling) (screaming)

684
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,670
(groaning)

685
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:40,350

(grunting)

687
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:22,290
(gasping)

688
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,140
(grunting)

689
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:41,450
(screaming)

690
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:05,770
- Just hurry!

691
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:13,710
(crashes)

692
01:08:14,610 --> 01:08:17,080
(groaning)

693
01:08:20,890 --> 01:08:22,190

696
01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:48,150
(screams)

697
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:51,220
- Come on, let's get out of here!

698
01:09:13,110 --> 01:09:18,240
(sword scrapes) (demonic howling)

699
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:25,550
(breathing heavily) (suspenseful music)

700
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:46,270
(winds blowing)

701
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:54,010
(splatters)

702
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:58,280

(footsteps tapping)

704
01:10:42,130 --> 01:10:46,330
- The very abyss in hell trembles at your coming.

705
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:51,140
Even the dead stir in joyous anticipation,

706
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,540
for you are wicked,

707
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:56,540
and the wicked must be truly rewarded.

708
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:02,410
So I give to you the great gift

709
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:08,350
of all eternity in this sweet place of purgatory.

710
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:26,670
(horse whinnies)

711
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:31,410
The infidels land is filled with idols,

712
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,550
yet it's written,

713
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:37,520
"You shall cast out your idols

714
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:41,490
"for they are sinful things of silver and gold,

715
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:44,390
(sword scrapes) "made by your own hand."

716
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,390
(horse whinnies)

717
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:48,460
(motor revs)

718
01:11:48,530 --> 01:11:51,530
(doors slam)

719

(blade scrapes)

728
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,690
- No! (splattering)
