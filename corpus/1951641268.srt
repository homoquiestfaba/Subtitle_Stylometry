1
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,600
Mortal Kombat
is not about death...

2
00:00:53,635 --> 00:00:56,700
but, rather,
the preservation of life.

3
00:00:56,735 --> 00:00:57,465
Liu Kang

4
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,100
and few chosen fighters from the Earth Realm...

5
00:01:00,135 --> 00:01:02,700
defeated Outworld sorcerer Shang Tsung.

6
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,865
According to the rules of Mortal Kombat...

7
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,300
their victory preserved the safety of the Earth...

8
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:09,500
for one more generation.

9
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,700
Our chosen ones
were returned to Liu Kang's home on Earth...

10
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,300
only to enjoy
a brief period of peace.

11
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,465
For someone from Outworld

12
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,500
has a different point of view.

13
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,100
Shao-Kahn,

14
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,465
emperor of Outworld.

15
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,500
The earth
was created in six days...

16
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:51,500
so too shall it be destroyed.

17
00:02:51,535 --> 00:02:52,700
And on the seventh day,

18
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,700
mankind will rest...

19
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,500
in peace!

20
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,465
This is not good.

21
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,465
Somehow he's opened gateways
to your world.

22
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,465
I thought our victory in Mortal Kombat
closed those portals.

23
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,500
- What closes can also open again.
- What is that suppose to mean?

24
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,500
Mother.

25
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,900
You're alive.

26
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,500
Too bad you... will die.

27
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,500
As long as I have the power Khan,
you will never rule this world.

28
00:03:43,535 --> 00:03:46,500
As long as the portal remains open,...

29
00:03:46,535 --> 00:03:48,500
your world becomes my world!

30
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,500
You will never win.

31
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,700
Master.

32
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,465
This ends now!

33
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,700
You hide behind a human?

34
00:04:57,735 --> 00:04:59,865
Why not, Lord Rayden?

35
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,100
You hid behind them
your entire pathetic life.

36
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,500
No! Johnnnny!

37
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,500
Surrender, Rayden, or this one dies.

38
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,865
Then I will take your generals.

39
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,700
Because Earth does not bend
to the will of tyrants.

40
00:05:31,735 --> 00:05:35,500
You would never let
one of your precious humans die.

41
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,700
Trade me for Johnny Cage.

42
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,500
Come bow at my feet.

43
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,500
YOU FOOL!

44
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,265
In six days,

45
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,900
you will all bow to me!

46
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,500
It has begun!

47
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,200
We can't let Kahn get away with this.

48
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:45,900
This is not a fight we can win here.

49
00:06:45,935 --> 00:06:49,500
Annihilate 'em!

50
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
We must go.

51
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Move back!

52
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,065
Kahn has opened the portal.

53
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,500
Your planet and Outworld
have begun to merge into one realm.

54
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,500
Think of it as hell on Earth.

55
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,500
My mother... resurrected.

56
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,465
How is that possible?

57
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,300
If I'm correct, your mother Sindel
is the key to all of this.

58
00:07:34,335 --> 00:07:35,500
This can't be!
We won the tournament!

59
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,500
The rules say the Earth is safe
for another generation.

60
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,265
Obviously Kahn has cheated and broken the rules.

61
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,100
I believe he has resurrected your mother to keep
these portals open indefinitely.

62
00:07:45,135 --> 00:07:47,117
By reuniting you with her,...

63
00:07:47,152 --> 00:07:49,100
Kahn's spell will be broken...

64
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,300
your mother's soul
will be at peace...

65
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,900
and his portals closed.

66
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,900
- How could the Elder Gods allow this?
- I do not know.

67
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:02,500
But Kahn must be stopped,
or your world will perish.
We have six days until annihilation.

68
00:08:02,535 --> 00:08:04,300
I beat Shang Tsung.
I can beat Kahn.

69
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,500
Yes... You beat a great sorcerer...
and you win the tournament,

70
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,100
but you're no match for Kahn.

71
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,100
If anyone's going to kill Kahn,
it's going to be me.

72
00:08:14,135 --> 00:08:16,500
Enough!

73
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,665
You are far from ready.

74
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,500
When those portals open
Kahn's extermination squads
will be everywhere, hunting.

75
00:08:27,535 --> 00:08:30,017
I am telling you this
for your own good.

76
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:32,465
Kahn knows I have no powers
in Outworld.

77
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,500
As the two realms merge,
I will lose my powers here on Earth.

78
00:08:36,535 --> 00:08:40,500
Each of you must grow stronger,
together.

79
00:08:40,535 --> 00:08:42,500
We are the only hope.

80
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,100
Together...

81
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,100
We couldn't even save Johnny.

82
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,700
What do these do?

83
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,300
Once inside the velosphere, you can
travel to anywhere on Earth in hours.

84
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:04,900
The inner winds propel you.

85
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,500
You'll be moving so fast, it'll be
as though you're not moving at all.

86
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,500
Whoa...

87
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,100
We need your help, Sonya.

88
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,100
I will take you
to find your partner Jax.

89
00:09:16,135 --> 00:09:16,865
Forget it.

90
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,900
- If I die, that's fine,
but I'm not losing anybody else.
- Alone, you are vulnerable...

91
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,465
but if you work together as a team,
you can do much.

92
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,465
- What about us?
- The two of you will travel to the Hopi mesa.

93
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,500
You did great last time Liu,
but this time you will need help
in what you are about to face.

94
00:09:31,535 --> 00:09:33,465
Go deep into the night.

95
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,300
Seek the counsel of one called Nightwolf.

96
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:39,100
You will not find him.
He will find you.

97
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,100
I will speak with the Elder Gods
and I will demand answers to what Shao-Kahn
has done.

98
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,500
-Ready?
-Ready.

99
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,900
Here we go.

100
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,900
They are faster than I remember.
I can't wait.

101
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,865
This is amazing.

102
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,900
It's a hot air rising
from the Earth's core.

103
00:10:07,935 --> 00:10:10,500
We've harness its energy.

104
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,265
What's going on?
Where are we?

105
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,500
The interchange.
Roll to your right. Hard!

106
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,300
Hold on to me.

107
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,500
Hold on to me.

108
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,500
Father, the merger has begun.
Earth is under attack.

109
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,465
And it is glorious!

110
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:33,100
Tell me... did you make Rayden beg for his life
before destroying him?

111
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:46,500
Rayden... is of no concern to us.

112
00:11:46,535 --> 00:11:49,465
YOU LET HIM LIVE?!

113
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,500
He could not be stopped.

114
00:11:52,535 --> 00:11:55,465
I have no use for excuses.

115
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,465
I have broken the sacred rules
to keep the portals open.

116
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,300
If the Elder Gods learn of our plot...
we shall both suffer the consequences.

117
00:12:04,335 --> 00:12:05,700
I do not understand.

118
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,465
How can you fear the Elder Gods?

119
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,500
With control of the Earth,
our power will be absolute.

120
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,500
Until the sixth day has passed...

121
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:20,500
we can take no chances
with Rayden and his mortals.

122
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,500
Do not underestimate
the power of the human spirit.

123
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,500
Liu, if anything happens to me, I want you to...

124
00:13:03,535 --> 00:13:04,700
Kitana!

125
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,500
I have lost everything.

126
00:13:11,500 --> 00:15:14,500
I am not going to lose you, too.

127
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,500
Liu, the missile!

128
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,300
You must go.

129
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,900
There will be others.

130
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,500
I killed you in the tournament.

131
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,100
You killed my older brother.

132
00:15:52,135 --> 00:15:54,500
So, why did you help us?

133
00:15:54,535 --> 00:15:55,700
I helped her.

134
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:00,300
Because legend has it the princess
is the key to stopping Kahn plot.

135
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:01,500
You've been following us.

136
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,465
Why?

137
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Two days ago, Kahn reprogrammed Smoke
to come after you instead of me...

138
00:16:06,535 --> 00:16:09,517
in order to keep you apart
from Queen Sindel.

139
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,500
Alright.
So how do we get to Nightwolf now?

140
00:16:12,535 --> 00:16:14,700
We have a common enemy,
Sub-Zero.

141
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:23,500
You must help us with your powers
if you want to stop Kahn.

142
00:16:23,535 --> 00:16:58,500
Let's hope you succeed.

143
00:16:58,535 --> 00:18:35,500
Get over here!

144
00:18:35,535 --> 00:18:36,700
Take it!

145
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,500
SUCKERRRRS!

146
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,500
KITANA!

147
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,500
I've got to find Kitana.

148
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,500
Kahn wants you to go after her.

149
00:18:53,535 --> 00:18:54,465
Don't.

150
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,465
Without Kitana, it's over.
We've lost.

151
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,500
What happened here, she proved you alone are not ready
for what's ahead.

152
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,300
You'll take the same track back
and turn where I showed you.

153
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,100
Don't worry about me.

154
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
Is it like this everywhere?

155
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,500
With each hour, the merger
of the realms grows closer.

156
00:19:42,535 --> 00:19:45,500
More of the Earth will be destroyed.

157
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,900
I will meet you at the temple of the Elder Gods.

158
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,465
Jax!

159
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,100
Thought I was supposed
to be rescuing you.

160
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,900
Yeah, well I couldn't wait.

161
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,500
What the hell have you done
to yourself this time?

162
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,465
Cybernetic strength-enhancers.

163
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,500
It takes what you've got,
and quadruples your muscle capacity.

164
00:20:22,535 --> 00:20:25,500
You've got a real confidence problem,
you know that?

165
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,500
These locks must be
on some kind of a remote-access mechanism.

166
00:20:32,535 --> 00:20:34,500
What's going on? What you doing here?

167
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,500
Everybody split.
The whole facility is going to be trashed
by an extermination squad.

168
00:20:38,535 --> 00:20:41,465
- EXTRMINATION SQUAD?!
What you mean, extermination squad?
- Look!

169
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
All you need to know is they're trying to kill me,
and probably you, too.

170
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,300
ME?! I don't even know these dudes!

171
00:20:46,335 --> 00:20:49,500
Where you been anyway?

172
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,865
Damn it!
I can't get you free Jax.

173
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,300
Alright now, stand back, stand back.
Let's see what I'm made of.

174
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,700
Yeah... Now that's what I'm talking about.

175
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,665
Wish I had these babies back in high school.

176
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,500
- You're gonna wish
you were back in high school.
- Is that right?

177
00:21:14,535 --> 00:21:29,465
C'mon Jax, Hurry!

178
00:21:29,500 --> 00:22:13,465
What the hell is that?

179
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:18,500
Death is the only way out.
Major Briggs, Sonya Blade...

180
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,500
Shao-Kahn will be pleased.

181
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,100
Shao what?

182
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,900
I'll take homeboy.

183
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,500
Yo, I take it this ain't something
we can talk about.

184
00:22:34,535 --> 00:22:35,300
I guess not.

185
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
Sonya, heads up!

186
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,500
Catch this!

187
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,900
Let's do this.

188
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,100
No.

189
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,500
Yeah, now what?

190
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,700
Cybernetic strength-enhancers!

191
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,300
Nice look...

192
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,065
But I'd lose the wall.

193
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,900
I was just getting
a feel for it, too.

194
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,900
Watch out, honey.

195
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,100
Watch out!

196
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,700
Damn!

197
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,500
You barbecued his ass.

198
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,300
Look at this.

199
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:56,700
- Does this mean what I think it does?
- Too bad I didn't get myself new legs.

200
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,500
My squads have already claimed thousands
of innocent souls on Earth.

201
00:26:25,535 --> 00:26:27,465
And I will claim millions.

202
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,100
By now, you'd be behind bars on display
in a ZOO.

203
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,500
If those bars could keep me away
from you, Sheeva...

204
00:26:34,535 --> 00:26:45,500
I would welcome them!

205
00:26:45,535 --> 00:26:52,465
Silence!

206
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,865
What is your report?

207
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,500
Two of Earth's best warriors
have been taken...

208
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,065
Kabaal and Stryker.

209
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:03,900
Tell me, did you make them beg for
their lives before you destroyed them?

210
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,300
But Master... I thought if I let them live...

211
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:07,900
I have no use for excuses!

212
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,465
Rain...

213
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,000
this will never happen again.

214
00:27:21,035 --> 00:27:23,500
It will never happen again.

215
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,300
It is true,
this will never happen again.

216
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,100
It is also true I need a new general.

217
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,900
You can die in duty or by my hand.
The choice is yours.

218
00:27:41,935 --> 00:27:44,265
Centaurs are known
for their hunting prowess.

219
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,500
As your general, I will personally
hunt down every human soul...

220
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,500
And spare no one!

221
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,065
Motaro can't be trusted.

222
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,700
Long ago, I proved myself
as the personal protector of Queen Sindel.

223
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,300
Your orders are mine to follow.

224
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,500
The energies they waste
with their sniveling...

225
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,500
I will use to capture souls...

226
00:28:02,535 --> 00:28:03,500
For you.

227
00:28:03,535 --> 00:28:04,465
No.

228
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,300
You are all far too impetuous
for such an important work.

229
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:14,700
You... are my new general,
Queen Sindel...

230
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,300
unless anyone else
has a different point of view.

231
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,500
Pretty cool, huh?

232
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,900
It's my animality.

233
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,465
Who are you?

234
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,000
Wouldn't you like to know?

235
00:30:07,035 --> 00:30:09,500
So you're Rayden's prodigy.

236
00:30:09,535 --> 00:30:11,517
I've seen better.

237
00:30:11,552 --> 00:30:13,465
Don't sweat it.

238
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,465
I've seen worse, too.

239
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:21,500
If you are Nightwolf,
you know I won Mortal Kombat.

240
00:30:21,535 --> 00:30:23,465
Don't get cocky.

241
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:28,500
The tournament had rules.
This time, anything goes.

242
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:31,017
It was a mistake even coming here.

243
00:30:31,052 --> 00:30:33,465
You think you're ready Liu Kang...

244
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:40,500
but if you were,
would Kitana have been captured?

245
00:30:40,535 --> 00:30:43,500
Can you help me get her back?

246
00:30:43,535 --> 00:30:44,465
Maybe...

247
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,465
Kitana is important.

248
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,500
But to beat Shao-Kahn,
you've got to pass three tests.

249
00:30:49,535 --> 00:30:51,465
First one's courage.

250
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,500
- I don't have time for these stupid games!
- To test your courage and find your animality...

251
00:30:55,535 --> 00:30:59,500
you've got to put yourself in a dream state.

252
00:30:59,535 --> 00:31:04,465
And just how am I supposed to do that?

253
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,500
Well, there's a slow way
and there’s a fast way.

254
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:11,617
I don't have time for the slow way.

255
00:31:11,652 --> 00:31:14,700
That's what I thought you'd say.

256
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,700
Sweet dreams, Liu Kang!

257
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,500
I had faith in you Liu Kang,...

258
00:31:30,535 --> 00:31:32,500
but you have failed me.

259
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,900
You are not the warrior
I thought you were.

260
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500
What if I fail?
What if I fail everyone?

261
00:31:38,535 --> 00:31:41,500
Your brother's soul is mine!

262
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,665
Fight from the inside, Liu.

263
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,465
It's the fire inside of you,...

264
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,500
your everlasting faith in yourself...

265
00:31:53,535 --> 00:31:55,465
that can never be defeated.

266
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,100
Liu Kang, the fire that burns inside you...
is guilt.

267
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,500
You lost Kitana.

268
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,865
You are not a leader.

269
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,500
Find that power inside you.

270
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,500
Feel your animality.

271
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,900
You...

272
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:39,717
will...

273
00:32:39,752 --> 00:33:01,500
FAIL!

274
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,100
I am Jade.

275
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,900
I have searched the mesa for you Liu Kang.

276
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,500
Of all the horrors darkness holds...

277
00:33:26,535 --> 00:33:30,465
to die alone...

278
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:39,465
that is my worst fear.

279
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,100
With you Liu Kang, I'm not afraid.

280
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,700
This is almost too good to be true.

281
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,700
The same could be said about you.

282
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,500
No!

283
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,465
My heart...

284
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,500
belongs to another.

285
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:24,700
I can't.

286
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,340
There's not much time left.

287
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,300
Is this just another dream?

288
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:58,500
How can you beat Shao-Kahn
when alone I'm too much for you?

289
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,100
First you betray me,
now you laugh?

290
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,380
You are more pure and faithful
than I heard.

291
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,060
You have passed the test Liu Kang.

292
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,300
A test?

293
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,580
This was just another one
of Nightwolf's crazy tests?

294
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,300
We could have killed each other!

295
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,220
But we live.

296
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,100
I will lead you to the temple
of the Elder Gods.

297
00:35:54,135 --> 00:35:55,500
I can't.

298
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,100
If this was just a test,
it was only his second.

299
00:35:58,135 --> 00:35:59,300
I'm not ready yet.

300
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,900
Not ready to save Kitana?

301
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,500
Because she's the key to all of this.

302
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,300
And I can take you to where she's kept.

303
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,500
She's alive?

304
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,300
For now, yes.
For how long, I cannot say.

305
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,500
We must go.

306
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,100
All your past betrayals
I can forgive.

307
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,900
Kitana, please accept this offering...

308
00:36:45,935 --> 00:36:47,900
for I do not want your death.

309
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,740
You sorely test my patience.

310
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,180
You destroyed my family.

311
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,900
You drove my mother
to kill herself.

312
00:37:28,935 --> 00:37:32,340
I am your enemy forever.

313
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,100
So kill me now... if you dare.

314
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,700
Foolish child.

315
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:44,265
A struggling worm and a hook...

316
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,700
lands a bigger catch
than a dead one.

317
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,500
No trees, no animals.

318
00:38:03,535 --> 00:38:04,500
Damn.

319
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,900
What's going on here?

320
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,300
Nature's dying.

321
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,065
The merger of the realms
is almost done.

322
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,900
You know Sonya, you keep talking
about mergers and realms and all that...

323
00:38:17,935 --> 00:38:19,500
but it don't mean squat to me, alright?.

324
00:38:19,535 --> 00:38:21,265
I can't explain it.

325
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,100
The merger is close,
we've only got a few days left.

326
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,700
Use your imagination.

327
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,700
Use my imagination?

328
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,900
You keep talking to me like that Sonya,
and I'mma split, alright.

329
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,100
Look...
you dragged me out the base
with some lunatic killers after us...

330
00:38:38,135 --> 00:38:40,500
put me in a spinnin' ball, take me
halfway around the world.

331
00:38:40,535 --> 00:38:42,900
If I'm gonna die today,
at least tell me why.

332
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,340
Nobody told me
why Johnny had to die.

333
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,780
What is it with you?

334
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,260
And who the hell is Johnny?

335
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,865
O.K. Sonya, I'm your partner.

336
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,260
If you can't trust me,
who can you trust?

337
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,300
Well obviously, nobody but me.

338
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,900
Nobody but you?

339
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,900
Every time you ever needed me,
I was there.

340
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,100
I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere
because of you!

341
00:39:03,135 --> 00:39:04,700
I don't even know where I am!

342
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,300
I need to use the rest room.
I ain't got no toilet tissue.

343
00:39:08,335 --> 00:39:12,140
I got metal things on my hands!
Sonya wait!

344
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,500
Kitana?

345
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,100
You wish.

346
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,700
I told you these arms were good
at something.

347
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,500
Thanks Jax.

348
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,265
I owe you one.

349
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,300
I don't know how much longer
I can take this.

350
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,100
But you do look good in mud.

351
00:41:31,135 --> 00:41:32,065
Jax.

352
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,940
Well you do.

353
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,020
I gotta go find a river.

354
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,300
We better roll.

355
00:41:41,335 --> 00:41:41,900
Let's do it.

356
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,740
They don't use parachutes.

357
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,465
I have come
to the Eternal Palace...

358
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:29,180
because your sacred rules
have been broken.

359
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,500
Shao-Kahn has invaded the Earth.

360
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:55,500
As always Lord Rayden,
you are granted three questions.

361
00:42:55,535 --> 00:42:56,500
The first must be:

362
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,620
Why was this treachery allowed?

363
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,540
We do not control destiny of men.

364
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:06,300
Everyone possesses the ability to change their fate.

365
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,500
So you will stand by and watch
the ruination of Earth?

366
00:43:11,535 --> 00:43:12,265
You are correct...

367
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:16,740
in believing Kitana is the key
to closing Kahn's portals.

368
00:43:16,775 --> 00:43:19,865
But if I reunite her with Sindel...

369
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:23,300
how can I be sure Kahn's portals
will stay closed until the next tournament?

370
00:43:23,335 --> 00:43:27,300
Only when Shao-Kahn is destroyed
will the future be safe.

371
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:32,500
After living along with humans,
do you truly believe they’re worth saving?

372
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,100
More than anything I know.

373
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:38,700
Do you love them enough
to sacrifice your immortality?

374
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,700
I don't see no street signs,
no mailboxes.

375
00:43:51,735 --> 00:43:53,100
Which tomb is the Elder Gods'?

376
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,860
Just keep moving Jax.

377
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,500
Sonya!

378
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,780
You know this dude?

379
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:09,780
Yeah.

380
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,500
Is that Jax?

381
00:44:14,535 --> 00:44:15,065
Yeah.

382
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,265
Who is she?

383
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,820
Jade, this is Sonya Blade.

384
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,100
Major Jackson Briggs.

385
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,500
You've got an incredible set of legs...

386
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:27,080
for kicking I mean.

387
00:44:27,115 --> 00:44:29,460
Where's Kitana?

388
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,065
She was kidnapped by Scorpion.

389
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,300
You lost Kitana
and you picked up her?

390
00:44:35,335 --> 00:44:37,700
She helped me get here.

391
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:41,900
Now thanks to you,
we got Kahn's extermination squads on us butts.

392
00:44:41,935 --> 00:44:43,265
Can I make a suggestion here?

393
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:48,740
Let's put this petty stuff aside and start worrying
about bigger things, like staying alive.

394
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,265
He's not here, either.

395
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,100
We're just gonna sit here
wait for this dude to show?

396
00:45:18,135 --> 00:45:19,900
Without Rayden, it's hopeless.

397
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,060
Never give up hope.

398
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,900
At least not so early in a fight.

399
00:45:34,935 --> 00:45:35,900
Rayden?

400
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,740
It's a new look.

401
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,700
Who's the girl? Can she fight
as good as she looks?

402
00:45:42,735 --> 00:45:43,465
Better.

403
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,900
Good, because I was expecting
a team of fighters.

404
00:45:45,935 --> 00:45:48,265
Instead, I hear fighters
war with each other.

405
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,665
Oh, give us a break Rayden.
We've been through hell.

406
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:54,100
Compared to what lies ahead,
you've been through nothing.

407
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,065
Where's Kitana?

408
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,500
Kahn took her.
It's all my fault.

409
00:45:58,535 --> 00:46:00,117
This is not about blame.

410
00:46:00,152 --> 00:46:01,700
We're together in this.

411
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:05,900
Each of us must help and support
the others, like a family.

412
00:46:05,935 --> 00:46:07,860
What's the deal with your arms?

413
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,500
I've known you one minute,
and you're dissin' me already?

414
00:46:10,535 --> 00:46:12,217
I mean no disrespect.

415
00:46:12,252 --> 00:46:13,865
You have real skills.

416
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,900
Those arms are not your strength.
They're your weakness.

417
00:46:15,935 --> 00:46:17,065
Oh, well thanks for the tip.

418
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,500
But these things right here,
state of the art.

419
00:46:20,535 --> 00:46:23,300
Faith in yourself
is all you need.

420
00:46:23,335 --> 00:46:26,180
And I say that to all of you.

421
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:31,100
I will try to open a portal to Outworld
while I still can.

422
00:46:31,135 --> 00:46:32,500
Follow me!

423
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:03,100
My powers are leaving me.

424
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:08,980
Who does this dude think he is,
Moses parting the Red Sea?

425
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:15,100
Destroy... everything!

426
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,260
Whenever you're ready Rayden.

427
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,220
Come on.

428
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,540
That was fun.

429
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:10,700
They have taken the bait
and fallen right into our trap.

430
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,465
Proceed as planned.

431
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,260
I will await your arrival
in Outworld.

432
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,740
My skin is burnin' up,
but I'm freezin' inside.

433
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,380
Feels like I got microwaved or somethin'.

434
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:30,140
You never do get used to that.

435
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,820
My God is that what I think it is?

436
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,300
The realms are merging.

437
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:39,100
This will continue to happen unless
Kahn's portals are closed.

438
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,100
Time is against us.

439
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,700
- All those people in their cars...
- Torn between realms.

440
00:48:43,735 --> 00:48:45,900
It's like a nightmare or somethin' man.

441
00:48:45,935 --> 00:48:48,100
We have to stop this.

442
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:52,300
To do that,
we must rescue Kitana.

443
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,300
I know Kahn took Kitana
back to his fortress.

444
00:48:55,335 --> 00:48:57,665
Hold up, hold up. Kahn?

445
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,300
You mean Mr. Bad Attitude back there?

446
00:48:59,335 --> 00:49:00,900
You want us to check out his crib?

447
00:49:00,935 --> 00:49:02,500
No way.

448
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,180
I ain't going
on no suicide mission.

449
00:49:05,215 --> 00:49:06,180
Rayden!

450
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,220
Jax is right.

451
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:10,700
That's probably
what Kahn wants us to do.

452
00:49:10,735 --> 00:49:11,665
No!

453
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,980
There is a secret passageway.

454
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,580
It was the one I used to escape.

455
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,700
How could you believe
the ruination of the Elders' temple...

456
00:49:36,735 --> 00:49:38,900
would not put our plan in jeopardy?

457
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:41,380
It was necessary
to convince the mortals...

458
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,465
that their only hope lie in Outworld.

459
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:47,100
You seem confident that Sindel
will capture Rayden and his mortals in your trap.

460
00:49:47,135 --> 00:49:49,665
I promise you father, on my soul.

461
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:53,260
All the millenniums of planning
will be rewarded.

462
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,620
You will be proud.

463
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,820
Know this...

464
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:01,620
I will take your soul myself
if you fail me now.

465
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,060
I will rally
the extermination squads...

466
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:11,140
and prepare for victory.

467
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:14,140
The merger
will soon be complete.

468
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:17,900
All your friends will be dead.

469
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,100
This must have been Edenia.

470
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,265
The royal family's temple.

471
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,860
Kitana told me I would find it here.

472
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,660
Look like this babe is havin'
a bad hair day.

473
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,940
They must have followed us.

474
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:07,180
Perhaps, but it may be
a blessing in disguise.

475
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:10,100
We need Sindel
to close Kahn's portals forever.

476
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:13,300
- I'll take care of her.
- I'll rescue Kitana.

477
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:37,500
Something finally went right for a change.
We won.

478
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,665
Who finished off Sindel?

479
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:43,500
After she blasted you,
I surprised her from behind.

480
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,980
Maybe she came in handy
after all huh.

481
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:55,940
You are witness to the dawning
of mankind's final day!

482
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:59,980
The two realms will be one!

483
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:07,300
Rayden and his mortals
have fallen for my trick...

484
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,380
and failed to stop us.

485
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:13,465
Bring Rayden and his mortals
to bow at my feet.

486
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:19,500
So then with their dying breaths,
they can witness the birth...

487
00:53:19,535 --> 00:53:25,300
of the greatest army
in existence!

488
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,300
It's a trap Liu. Leave!

489
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,700
Up there!

490
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,300
The date's over.

491
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,660
Only your love...

492
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,500
can reunite her body and soul.

493
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:13,180
Kitana...

494
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,300
your love...

495
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,820
can break the hold
Kahn has over your mother...

496
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,820
and close his portals to Earth.

497
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:55,260
I have prayed for the day...

498
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,260
when our love...

499
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,100
will bring us together again.

500
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:12,465
Love.. I have never loved you.

501
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:16,500
With such a pathetic child as you,
what reason was there to love?

502
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,700
I knew it could not be true.

503
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:20,340
It cannot be.

504
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:24,660
But it can... and it is.

505
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:28,060
And you are powerless...

506
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,180
Thunder God.

507
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:37,060
It's over.

508
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,740
You fools.

509
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,420
You've been tricked.

510
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:42,300
The legend was a lie.

511
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:45,140
Kahn's portals stay open.

512
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:48,620
Now the merger
is nearly complete.

513
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,220
How could you do this to us?

514
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:54,620
It was so easy.

515
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:58,620
You will die for this, Jade.

516
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:35,700
That's it.

517
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,180
We trusted you, man.

518
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:38,580
And what happens?

519
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:40,580
You take us
on a wild goose chase.

520
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,700
I don't understand.

521
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:45,020
You were advised
by the Elder Gods.

522
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:46,880
The Gods must've lied to me.

523
00:59:46,915 --> 00:59:48,100
Yo, forget your gods...

524
00:59:48,135 --> 00:59:49,420
and immortals...

525
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,260
and all that junk!

526
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:54,580
I say the only ones we can trust
from here on out are humans.

527
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:57,060
Nobody else, not even Rayden.

528
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:58,220
Don't you understand?

529
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:01,580
By leading us here,
he is mortal now, just like you.

530
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:03,700
All his powers
have been sacrificed.

531
01:00:03,735 --> 01:00:04,665
That's even worse.

532
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,265
How do we stop Kahn now?

533
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,500
There's more to this than Kahn.

534
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:11,900
If Sindel is not the key
to closing Kahn's portals,

535
01:00:11,935 --> 01:00:14,860
then Kahn
has a higher allegiance.

536
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:16,540
Wait a second.

537
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,020
That tattoo.
I've seen it before.

538
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:21,100
On a robot and a woman.

539
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,940
They both tried to kill me.

540
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,980
And both of them
worked for Kahn.

541
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:30,780
This tattoo is a family crest...

542
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,260
bestowed only to my bloodline.

543
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:36,060
It is a permanent mark...

544
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,260
that allows safe passage
through the portals...

545
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,665
for the bearer
and his passengers.

546
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:43,100
The tattoos you saw, did they
flee the fighter upon death?

547
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,700
Took off like a bat out of hell.

548
01:00:44,735 --> 01:00:46,300
Temporary passes.

549
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,900
The did not share my bloodline.

550
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:50,220
But if it's your family crest...

551
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:52,420
how can Kahn's side
have it, too?

552
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:55,180
My father is an Elder God.

553
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:57,940
And only they can bestow
such a marking.

554
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,620
Your dad's an Elder God?

555
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:06,860
Funny how you failed
to mention that before.

556
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:12,060
If your father's an Elder God...

557
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:15,020
what does that make Kahn?

558
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,780
Shao-Kahn is my brother.

559
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:37,900
It was not my fault.

560
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:40,020
I did everything you ordered.

561
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:42,420
It was your job
to lure them to an ambush.

562
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:45,700
If they escaped,
then you failed me!

563
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:48,100
We could never
have stopped them alone.

564
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:49,420
Listen to her.

565
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:50,940
She speaks the truth.

566
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:52,860
We would've died trying.

567
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,300
You.

568
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,500
You are already dead!

569
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:00,840
And you...

570
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:02,980
will be soon.

571
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:18,180
You will mount a defense
around my newest temple.

572
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:21,020
Prepare for Rayden to make
one last attack.

573
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:23,580
You said Rayden
was no longer to be feared.

574
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:24,665
I am to be feared!

575
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,465
For if you fail me now...

576
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,900
I will feed
your rotting corpse...

577
01:02:28,935 --> 01:02:30,820
to the worms!

578
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:38,260
Your hallowed position
atop the worm pile appears...

579
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:40,940
to be most tenuous.

580
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:45,540
Now your failure
will be my opportunity.

581
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:55,380
Man, you got
one dysfunctional family you know that.

582
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:57,820
Years ago,
my father decreed...

583
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:01,300
that his heir to the family throne
must be strong enough...

584
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:04,220
to kill his own brother
in battle if necessary.

585
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:07,465
I beat my brother...

586
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,260
but I could not kill him.

587
01:03:09,295 --> 01:03:11,020
Only one thing is certain.

588
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:13,620
Kahn must die.

589
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,060
This time you're going to kill him.

590
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:18,220
I could not then.

591
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:20,940
I cannot now.

592
01:03:20,975 --> 01:03:22,665
So what do we do?

593
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:24,740
You will do your best.

594
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:26,940
It is all that can be expected.

595
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:28,620
I will pray for you all.

596
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:32,780
Listen to me.

597
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:34,460
Liu is our only hope.

598
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,220
I want to fight Kahn...

599
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:40,780
but I don't know if I'm ready.

600
01:03:40,815 --> 01:03:42,300
You must believe in yourself Liu.

601
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,900
We believe in you.

602
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,260
My home.

603
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:27,260
The Temple
of the Order of Light.

604
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:28,940
Your family.

605
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:32,260
There's so no time left.

606
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:35,260
Whatever time we have...

607
01:04:35,295 --> 01:04:36,780
we must use well.

608
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:40,100
Are we really ready to die here?

609
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:43,020
If we die...

610
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:45,500
we will die in battle.

611
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:48,340
Together.

612
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:48,260
Prepare for final battle!

613
01:05:48,295 --> 01:05:49,260
Khan!

614
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:56,940
So good of you to join us, son.

615
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:02,060
In less than one hour, the merger
of realms will be complete.

616
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:05,060
Father, you alone
have the power to end this.

617
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:06,100
Stop!

618
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:08,500
I do not want to remember you
this weak!

619
01:06:08,535 --> 01:06:11,700
It is not weak to value life!

620
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:17,180
I offer you one final chance
to return to my side, Rayden.

621
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:20,860
To rule all realms
with your family.

622
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:26,940
They are my family.

623
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:31,980
Then you shall die with the rest
of your pathetic human race!

624
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:33,020
FINISH HIM!

625
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:37,260
You should've killed me...

626
01:06:37,295 --> 01:06:40,300
when you had the chance...

627
01:06:40,335 --> 01:06:41,425
brother.

628
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:43,820
My brother died a long time ago.

629
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:46,140
His heart, anyway.

630
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:01,420
I win...

631
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:02,860
brother.

632
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,860
You cannot die.

633
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:23,020
I am proud to die...

634
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:25,180
a mortal.

635
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:29,860
Like you.

636
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:54,700
This is the beginning
of the end!

637
01:07:54,735 --> 01:07:56,700
Show them the way...

638
01:07:56,735 --> 01:07:58,700
to oblivion!

639
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:03,260
Mr. Ed is mine.

640
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:07,540
I'll take my mother.

641
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:13,460
Leftovers are fine with me.

642
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:22,580
Yeah I'll make you eat that thing.

643
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,300
I can't take
too much more of this.

644
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:40,940
Is that all you got?

645
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:52,500
Is that any way
to treat your mother?

646
01:08:52,535 --> 01:08:53,980
My mother's dead.

647
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:55,940
As soon will be her daughter.

648
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:19,540
That just leaves
you and me, Kahn.

649
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:55,465
Pathetic and weak.

650
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:59,380
Clearly Rayden has molded you
in his image.

651
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:32,820
Without your weapons...

652
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:34,660
you are no match for Motaro.

653
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:38,220
Jax, help!

654
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:43,900
I got everything I need
right here!

655
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:16,020
Help!

656
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,540
Get off her.

657
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:29,420
Get down, Sonya.

658
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:33,580
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

659
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:36,020
So you finally got
your confidence back, huh?

660
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,860
Finally asked for help, huh?

661
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:40,180
Whatever you are...

662
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:42,500
you will live
to see the end of Kahn...

663
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:45,220
to give my mother's soul peace.

664
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,180
Face it, Liu Kang.

665
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:59,420
You...

666
01:12:59,455 --> 01:13:01,340
will fail!

667
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:11,100
I can feel... it!

668
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:21,340
Now I done seen everything.

669
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,100
Impressive.

670
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:27,780
You've come prepared.

671
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:30,740
But not good enough.

672
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:41,140
Your blood flows, Kahn.

673
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:43,420
Just like the blood from a mortal.

674
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:46,065
Father...

675
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:47,780
How can this be?

676
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:51,180
I warned you
there would be consequences...

677
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,500
for breaking the sacred rules.

678
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:55,800
But I did not expect this.

679
01:14:55,835 --> 01:14:58,060
Must I do everything for you?

680
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:20,380
The fate of the universe...

681
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:23,700
will be decided as it should be.

682
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:26,580
In Mortal Kombat.

683
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:56,220
Nothing can alter your destiny,
nor mine!

684
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:01,380
I can, and I will!

685
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:05,100
That was the longest week
of my life.

686
01:18:05,135 --> 01:18:06,617
Oh, come on, Jax.

687
01:18:06,652 --> 01:18:08,065
Could've been worse.

688
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,300
Could've been the last week
of our lives.

689
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:11,780
Yeah I guess that's right.

690
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:15,940
What's up with that?

691
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:37,860
Was I dead?

692
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:40,020
It is only right
that Shinnok's son...

693
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:43,620
be allowed to take his place
in the Eternal Palace.

694
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:45,980
You've become one of us.

695
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:57,420
I will never forget
this moment, Liu.

696
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:06,940
You've all made me very proud.

697
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:11,380
I will be watching you...

698
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:13,540
so stay out of trouble.

699
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:16,940
And remember...

700
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,380
be there for one another.

701
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:23,220
You're a family now.
