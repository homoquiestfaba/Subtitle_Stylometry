00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:05,831
Thank you for the horse.

1
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,460
You liked him?

2
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:09,901
Oh, it's beautiful...

3
00:03:12,572 --> 00:03:14,597
but l thought
we were going sailing today.

4
00:03:19,813 --> 00:03:21,440
You promised.

5
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:30,949
Well, that one's too old.

6
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:39,658
See, now? That'll do.

7
00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:43,034
Come on!

8
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:45,003
Come on, Mr. E.

9
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:50,966
-It's broken.
-Who says?

10
00:03:52,312 --> 00:03:53,438
Mokelock.

11
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:56,548
Now, Edward, we agreed.

12
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,608
No more Mokelock.

13
00:03:58,718 --> 00:04:00,413
Mokelock is the bogeyman.

14
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:04,414
Mokelock wants me where l am.

15
00:04:04,457 --> 00:04:06,584
We can fix it.

16
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:14,592
Edward.

17
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,535
Sing a song of sixpence.

18
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:04,450
Sing a song of sixpence.

19
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:07,712
A pocketful of rye.

20
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,459
Four and twenty blackbirds.

21
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:25,594
Baked in a pie.

22
00:05:42,422 --> 00:05:44,390
Rise and shine.

23
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:58,596
Mr. E is doing fine.

24
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:06,575
Did we go sailing?

25
00:06:08,982 --> 00:06:11,382
Almost.

26
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:13,283
Mokelock showed up.

27
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,787
Mokelock is the bogeyman.

28
00:06:15,822 --> 00:06:17,551
Mokelock wants me where l am.

29
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,026
Mokelock is a pain in the ass.

30
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:24,526
Where'd he get Mokelock again?

31
00:06:24,564 --> 00:06:25,724
Mother Goose.

32
00:06:28,268 --> 00:06:29,428
-Henry.
-Barry.

33
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:31,630
What's the matter, Barry?

34
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:33,866
Edward's parents are here.

35
00:06:47,353 --> 00:06:48,820
He needs a haircut.

36
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:52,052
He loves it when you visit.

37
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:55,625
My husband
wonders if that's true.

38
00:06:57,764 --> 00:06:59,891
He wants to place Edward
in the hospital.

39
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:02,527
I'm sorry, Catherine.

40
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:06,236
Mr. Baines...

41
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:11,270
l've been working on
this project for seven years.

42
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:14,542
I know, Henry.
I know.

43
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:19,747
Please don't take offense,
Dr. Kent.

44
00:07:19,786 --> 00:07:22,414
Your work's invaluable
to this company.

45
00:07:22,455 --> 00:07:24,320
But you're not sure about me.

46
00:07:24,357 --> 00:07:28,316
We've waited eighteen months
for signs of progress.

47
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:30,420
There has been progress.

48
00:07:30,463 --> 00:07:32,727
There's no proof, Catherine.

49
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:34,563
With all due respect,
Mr. Baines...

50
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:37,397
I'm not the one
who designed the procedure.

51
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:40,972
I mean, I wish I could take
credit for it, but I can't .

52
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:45,273
I was chosen to do ajob.
They picked me.

53
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:48,038
But if you think
there's someone better...

54
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:53,482
or someone who's more devoted
to your son, then--

55
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,385
No one's doubting your ability,
Catherine.

56
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:56,888
What is it, then?

57
00:07:56,923 --> 00:07:58,823
There's no proof, Catherine.

58
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:02,294
There's no proof
the procedure works.

59
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:04,228
All you're giving me
is the belief...

60
00:08:04,264 --> 00:08:06,858
that your interaction
with my son...

61
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,492
is not a...

62
00:08:09,936 --> 00:08:11,369
hallucination.

63
00:09:57,777 --> 00:09:58,903
Shit!

64
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:24,068
I better get back to work.

65
00:10:24,103 --> 00:10:25,798
Oh, good-bye, Mrs. Baines.

66
00:10:25,838 --> 00:10:28,739
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Mr. Baines.

67
00:10:29,642 --> 00:10:31,667
Come, shall we? Lucien.

68
00:10:40,086 --> 00:10:41,553
Lucky she worships you.

69
00:10:41,587 --> 00:10:43,885
Why? Because he hates me?

70
00:10:43,923 --> 00:10:46,118
I wouldn't say "hates."

71
00:10:46,326 --> 00:10:49,124
Distrusts,
dislikes immensely...

72
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:51,126
can't bear the sight of.

73
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:56,900
What's the verdict?

74
00:10:56,936 --> 00:10:58,995
Well, we've got
another six months...

75
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:01,936
and Barry had to push for that.

76
00:11:04,978 --> 00:11:07,003
I want to reverse the feed, Miriam...

77
00:11:07,046 --> 00:11:08,775
now more than ever.

78
00:11:09,983 --> 00:11:11,746
We've been through this
a hundred times, Catherine.

79
00:11:11,784 --> 00:11:13,479
it's too risky.

80
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,487
Why not?
What do we have to lose?

81
00:11:15,555 --> 00:11:18,353
When I did social work,
it was always better...

82
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:20,757
when we took the kids
out of their environment.

83
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:24,359
Foster homes
can be scary at first...

84
00:11:24,397 --> 00:11:26,991
but eventually they see
that things can be different.

85
00:11:27,033 --> 00:11:29,365
Edward is like that right now.

86
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:34,806
He--he's living in a world
that is not healthy.

87
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:36,809
Let's show him
a different place.

88
00:11:36,843 --> 00:11:39,368
All right.
Let's say we do it your way.

89
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:43,371
We reverse the feed, and
we bring Edward into your mind.

90
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,509
Can you imagine his shock
when he finds...

91
00:11:45,551 --> 00:11:47,519
that he's been thrust
into this whole other world?

92
00:11:47,587 --> 00:11:51,523
-I do it all the time.
-You're a willing participant.

93
00:11:51,591 --> 00:11:53,559
You're aware
of what's happening.

94
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:55,458
Edward's in a coma.

95
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:58,794
And be sides, we don't know
what effect it will have on you.

96
00:11:58,831 --> 00:12:01,732
I mean,
you're already exhausted.

97
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:03,736
-Have you been sleeping?
-Yes.

98
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,738
-Any more nightmares?
-No.

99
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:10,775
-No.
-Good.

100
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,437
Leave work here.

101
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:14,309
Don't take it home in this.

102
00:13:23,516 --> 00:13:24,813
Hey, you.

103
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:29,479
What are you looking for, hmm?

104
00:13:29,522 --> 00:13:30,955
Want some milk?

105
00:13:51,077 --> 00:13:54,012
That's fun. Let me try it.

106
00:13:57,383 --> 00:14:00,648
Not so much power.
The animal is delicate.

107
00:15:02,582 --> 00:15:03,981
Edward, is that you?

108
00:15:04,016 --> 00:15:08,350
Edward, were there sea gulls
being killed on the beach...

109
00:15:08,387 --> 00:15:10,321
while you were sailing?

110
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:13,917
Don't hide, sweetie, please?
Edward, is that you?

111
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,258
Don't be afraid.

112
00:15:16,295 --> 00:15:18,661
No one will hurt you.

113
00:15:18,698 --> 00:15:20,723
Edward, is that you?

114
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:27,033
Go to sleep.

115
00:15:32,612 --> 00:15:34,045
Help!

116
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:38,517
Somebody, help me, please!

117
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,851
Somebody!

118
00:15:45,358 --> 00:15:46,757
Help me!

119
00:15:57,637 --> 00:15:59,104
Can you hear me?

120
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:01,535
Help!

121
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,480
Thanks for waiting, Cole.

122
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:54,356
Teddy Lee, no problem.

123
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:56,418
Special Agent Ramsey.

124
00:16:56,462 --> 00:16:57,827
-Cole.
-Morning.

125
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,028
Who found her?

126
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:04,794
The surveyor for the rail road,
about 6:00 this morning.

127
00:17:04,837 --> 00:17:08,603
Skid marks appear to match
the tire tracks from Reno.

128
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:11,769
And it looks like he scraped
the rail and lost some paint.

129
00:17:11,811 --> 00:17:13,403
It's on its way to the lab
already.

130
00:17:15,548 --> 00:17:17,482
Dumped the body over there.

131
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:35,059
Bleach.

132
00:17:36,335 --> 00:17:37,768
Anne Marie Vicksey.

133
00:17:37,803 --> 00:17:39,361
She makes seven.

134
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:41,032
Jeez, this stinks.

135
00:17:42,675 --> 00:17:43,733
Do they all look like dolls?

136
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:46,006
Every unfortunate soul.

137
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:48,807
What's that?

138
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:53,342
Some kind of a collar.
Part of his methodology.

139
00:17:53,386 --> 00:17:54,512
The way he puts it there?

140
00:17:56,489 --> 00:17:57,979
He makes it for them.

141
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,388
lt makes him feel
they belong to him.

142
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:04,655
Is the water always this low?

143
00:18:13,406 --> 00:18:15,374
Yeah, this time of year.

144
00:18:15,408 --> 00:18:17,569
Give me a coroner's report
right away.

145
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,703
Preliminary for ensics, too.

146
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:22,305
l don't want anyone
dragging their ass on this.

147
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,857
So, how was work?

148
00:18:36,896 --> 00:18:38,295
Oh, exhausting.

149
00:19:16,735 --> 00:19:19,260
I have no idea, Jean.
For God's sake.

150
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:22,740
Good luck with the monster.
I love you, too. I gotta go.

151
00:19:22,775 --> 00:19:25,039
-OK. Thanks. Bye.
-All right. Bye-bye.

152
00:19:29,014 --> 00:19:30,572
Hot off the presses.

153
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:37,247
There's nothing new to report,
gentlemen.

154
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,324
A match on his semen.

155
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:42,759
Water in her lungs...

156
00:19:42,795 --> 00:19:46,060
show high levels
of chlorine and rust.

157
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:53,397
What, pray tell, is this?

158
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:55,669
They say they found
some dog hair?

159
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,775
From a canine unit?

160
00:19:59,812 --> 00:20:01,439
No. There was no canine unit.

161
00:20:01,514 --> 00:20:03,778
And Anne Vicksey
doesn't own a dog, Teddy.

162
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:07,349
l want to see this.

163
00:20:12,324 --> 00:20:13,848
What you got, Teddy?

164
00:20:27,673 --> 00:20:30,369
Hypomelanosis.

165
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:33,776
And that means?

166
00:20:37,683 --> 00:20:40,413
A complete absence of melanin.

167
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:44,720
The dog is an albino.

168
00:20:47,793 --> 00:20:50,023
He'd love an animal like that.

169
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:51,654
Gentlemen...

170
00:20:51,697 --> 00:20:57,397
I believe an albino dog
is a rare animal indeed.

171
00:21:54,393 --> 00:21:55,951
Oh, my God.

172
00:21:59,865 --> 00:22:01,389
Oh, my God.

173
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:04,859
You poor boy.

174
00:22:04,903 --> 00:22:06,564
You're gonna be OK.

175
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:08,470
Baby, I'm so sorry.

176
00:22:40,606 --> 00:22:42,096
Jesus Christ, Peter.

177
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:45,971
Thought you were gonna get
some sleep, clean yourself up.

178
00:22:47,413 --> 00:22:48,539
I did.

179
00:22:50,015 --> 00:22:52,074
-They're waiting, you know.
-I'm ready.

180
00:22:54,987 --> 00:22:56,420
Let's go.

181
00:23:00,092 --> 00:23:02,060
We're gonna do this two ways.

182
00:23:03,062 --> 00:23:04,586
Breeders of German shepherds.

183
00:23:05,898 --> 00:23:07,024
Ford dealers.

184
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:13,605
I want you to be through,
and I also want you to be fast.

185
00:23:13,605 --> 00:23:15,436
This guy's accelerating.

186
00:23:15,474 --> 00:23:17,704
He only waited six days
this time.

187
00:23:17,743 --> 00:23:20,678
When he first started,
months could pass.

188
00:23:20,713 --> 00:23:23,648
And that means
one of two different things.

189
00:23:23,682 --> 00:23:27,049
One, he thinks we're stupid,
and we can't catch him.

190
00:23:28,053 --> 00:23:30,886
Two, which is the one
that I believe...

191
00:23:30,923 --> 00:23:32,823
he wants to be caught.

192
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:36,486
The dog hair thing is sloppy.

193
00:23:36,528 --> 00:23:39,895
He leaves Anne Marie Vicksey
in three inches of water.

194
00:23:39,932 --> 00:23:41,900
He knew that we'd find her.

195
00:23:41,934 --> 00:23:44,596
Now, there's one thing
I know for certain.

196
00:23:45,804 --> 00:23:47,738
If we can't stop him...

197
00:23:49,908 --> 00:23:51,933
he ain't gonna stop himself.

198
00:24:08,427 --> 00:24:09,826
Will this be all right?

199
00:24:11,396 --> 00:24:13,660
Yes, ma'am, that's great.
Thank you very much.

200
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:16,257
She was still
living at home, ma'am?

201
00:24:18,337 --> 00:24:20,328
We were looking through an partments.

202
00:24:20,372 --> 00:24:21,737
But they're not
moving in together...

203
00:24:21,774 --> 00:24:24,299
until after the wedding.

204
00:24:24,343 --> 00:24:25,742
Julia wants to be married.

205
00:24:25,778 --> 00:24:28,611
Did she ever mention anything
out of the ordinary?

206
00:24:28,647 --> 00:24:30,706
For instance,
somebody she was seeing mad...

207
00:24:30,749 --> 00:24:33,741
or somebody perhaps watching her
or following her?

208
00:24:36,355 --> 00:24:37,481
Pardon me.

209
00:24:39,525 --> 00:24:40,651
Ramsey.

210
00:24:42,594 --> 00:24:44,926
What if you made a mistake?

211
00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:47,056
Maybe this isn't the man.

212
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:48,828
Maybe Julia's safe.

213
00:24:51,503 --> 00:24:53,334
There's certain things
that he does...

214
00:24:53,372 --> 00:24:57,570
that make us pretty positive
that this is the man.

215
00:24:57,609 --> 00:25:01,272
Last year,
I lost my husband to cancer.

216
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:03,914
I went through
such terrible pain.

217
00:25:03,949 --> 00:25:06,782
But Julia,
she was always there for me.

218
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,954
What's going on, Gordon?

219
00:25:15,994 --> 00:25:19,430
Riverside sheriff found
a dog breeder in Woodcrest.

220
00:25:19,464 --> 00:25:20,795
Three years ago,
she had a buyer...

221
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:23,267
for an albino shepherd pup.

222
00:25:23,302 --> 00:25:24,701
Sheriff checks D.M.V.

223
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,933
Son of a bitch
drives a 92 ford pickup.

224
00:25:27,973 --> 00:25:30,271
-Guess what color.
-Aquamarine.

225
00:25:41,553 --> 00:25:42,850
Ramsey!

226
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:44,753
-Novak!
-Where is it?

227
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,985
Edison,
just east of Loma Park.

228
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:48,686
S.W.A.T.'s had the house
under surveillance...

229
00:25:48,727 --> 00:25:50,095
for about twenty minutes.

230
00:25:50,095 --> 00:25:51,892
Carl Rudolph Stargher.

231
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,932
No registered weapons,
no priors.

232
00:25:53,932 --> 00:25:55,763
Got a license for his dog,
though.

233
00:25:55,801 --> 00:25:57,701
Named him Valentine.

234
00:26:22,661 --> 00:26:25,721
You're the bad man,
aren't you, Carl?

235
00:26:35,073 --> 00:26:39,009
Mairzy doats and dozy doats

236
00:26:39,044 --> 00:26:41,911
And liddle lamzy divey

237
00:26:44,483 --> 00:26:46,747
A kiddley divey, too

238
00:26:46,785 --> 00:26:48,480
Wouldn't you?

239
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,511
Brock,
Agent Ramsey, Agent Novak.

240
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:54,451
We got here as fast as we could.
l briefed them on the way over.

241
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:56,477
Where do we stand?

242
00:27:56,521 --> 00:27:57,920
Here's the situation.

243
00:27:59,024 --> 00:28:01,356
We got a high-ground team
on the roof...

244
00:28:01,393 --> 00:28:03,327
a four man element to the east.

245
00:28:03,362 --> 00:28:05,990
We got an entry team in the van
across from the house...

246
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:08,022
a two man element to the south.

247
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:09,393
Have you seen him yet?

248
00:28:10,402 --> 00:28:12,802
No. There's been some movement
in the kitchen.

249
00:28:12,838 --> 00:28:14,567
Can't tell what it is.

250
00:28:14,606 --> 00:28:16,904
-You think the girl's in there?
-We'll assume she is.

251
00:28:39,431 --> 00:28:41,558
-FBl!
-Go!

252
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,261
Freeze, mother fucker!

253
00:29:00,052 --> 00:29:01,610
I got the dog!

254
00:29:01,653 --> 00:29:04,281
-Clear.
-Clear.

255
00:29:39,858 --> 00:29:41,758
They'll take him
to County General.

256
00:29:41,793 --> 00:29:43,556
Reid's already there.

257
00:29:43,595 --> 00:29:44,857
Make sure he stays cuffed.

258
00:29:44,896 --> 00:29:47,456
I want two men on him
at all times.

259
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:49,433
I don't want anyone
to treat him but Reid.

260
00:29:49,468 --> 00:29:51,800
Not so much as a thermometer
up his ass, understand?

261
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,937
She's not here.

262
00:29:59,845 --> 00:30:01,938
You should come downstairs.

263
00:31:12,951 --> 00:31:14,043
Mommy!

264
00:31:14,085 --> 00:31:17,646
Please take care
of my little baby!

265
00:31:17,689 --> 00:31:20,556
Please, are you there?
Hello?

266
00:31:37,676 --> 00:31:40,406
Please hear me.

267
00:31:43,448 --> 00:31:44,972
Can you hear me?

268
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,910
l need something.

269
00:31:52,023 --> 00:31:54,548
l need you...

270
00:31:54,793 --> 00:31:56,761
Anybody here?

271
00:31:57,662 --> 00:32:00,654
This is not happening to me.

272
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:04,760
This is definitely
not happening.

273
00:32:04,803 --> 00:32:06,862
Please help!

274
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,451
Have you ever heard
of Whelan's infraction?

275
00:32:28,827 --> 00:32:30,762
it's a form of schizophrenia.

276
00:32:30,762 --> 00:32:33,390
it's very rare,
and it's very severe.

277
00:32:34,432 --> 00:32:36,366
in any schizophrenic...

278
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:38,062
these areas would be affected...

279
00:32:38,103 --> 00:32:40,628
but in someone with Whelan's ...

280
00:32:40,672 --> 00:32:42,367
they're hit hard,
and they're hit fast.

281
00:32:42,407 --> 00:32:44,602
Can't you load him up
with thorazine or doxepin?

282
00:32:44,643 --> 00:32:47,669
Normal psycho tropics don't work.

283
00:32:47,712 --> 00:32:49,475
This thing
is caused by a virus...

284
00:32:49,514 --> 00:32:52,677
that infects the neurological
system in utero.

285
00:32:52,717 --> 00:32:54,048
lt lays dormant...

286
00:32:54,085 --> 00:32:57,384
until it's triggered
by some kind of trauma.

287
00:32:57,422 --> 00:32:59,686
Most likely, he's exhibited
symptoms for some time...

288
00:32:59,724 --> 00:33:01,988
but the infraction,
or the breach...

289
00:33:02,027 --> 00:33:03,654
didn't occur until today.

290
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,327
The triggers can vary.

291
00:33:06,364 --> 00:33:10,266
Uh, usually water-related,
but the results don't vary.

292
00:33:11,603 --> 00:33:14,071
He's notjust catatonic.

293
00:33:14,272 --> 00:33:15,398
He's disappeared--

294
00:33:16,641 --> 00:33:19,269
like having a dream
and never waking up.

295
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:20,972
For how long?

296
00:33:22,347 --> 00:33:23,678
Oh, forever.

297
00:33:29,054 --> 00:33:31,614
Lee, l think we might be missing
the bigger picture here.

298
00:33:31,656 --> 00:33:34,454
Now, whatever state
that he happens to be in...

299
00:33:34,492 --> 00:33:36,687
there is a girl
that is missing...

300
00:33:36,728 --> 00:33:39,356
and her name is Julia Hickson...

301
00:33:39,397 --> 00:33:42,798
and he is the only one
that knows where she is.

302
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:45,632
He keeps them in this thing...

303
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,865
for about forty hours.

304
00:33:47,906 --> 00:33:51,740
Now, he took Julia Hickson
at 7:30 last night.

305
00:33:51,776 --> 00:33:54,472
Peter, you know me.

306
00:33:54,512 --> 00:33:57,675
if there were
anything, anything...

307
00:34:05,056 --> 00:34:06,387
What?

308
00:34:38,957 --> 00:34:40,754
He provides them with food...

309
00:34:40,792 --> 00:34:43,761
drinking water, and a toilet.

310
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:47,826
Now, she thinks
she's been kidnapped...

311
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:49,959
that there's a chance
of survival...

312
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:52,435
but it's just a form of torture.

313
00:34:53,738 --> 00:34:54,932
This is a kind of ritual
for him--

314
00:34:54,973 --> 00:34:57,373
a cleansing
before he takes them home...

315
00:34:57,475 --> 00:35:00,706
and turns them into a doll,
a toy.

316
00:35:03,281 --> 00:35:04,942
Now, this thing
is fully automated...

317
00:35:06,451 --> 00:35:08,282
and unless we find her
by tonight...

318
00:35:09,988 --> 00:35:11,285
this will happen to her.

319
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:14,586
At the request
of Mr. Cooperman...

320
00:35:14,626 --> 00:35:17,562
we've contacted
your board of directors...

321
00:35:17,562 --> 00:35:19,291
and they've given
their approval.

322
00:35:21,533 --> 00:35:23,899
And so have Edward's parents.

323
00:35:23,935 --> 00:35:25,926
But the decision is yours.

324
00:35:35,947 --> 00:35:37,039
It's up to Catherine.

325
00:35:37,081 --> 00:35:39,481
She's the one
who would have to face...

326
00:35:39,517 --> 00:35:41,352
whatever risks there might be...

327
00:35:41,352 --> 00:35:44,719
so, l support
whatever decision she makes.

328
00:35:46,524 --> 00:35:47,718
Can l ask you something?

329
00:35:47,759 --> 00:35:49,761
Please.

330
00:35:49,761 --> 00:35:51,023
If he wasn't like this...

331
00:35:51,062 --> 00:35:52,931
If he was conscious...

332
00:35:52,931 --> 00:35:56,560
do you think that he would
tell you where she is?

333
00:35:57,769 --> 00:36:00,636
There's always a chance
of a confession. Yeah.

334
00:36:00,672 --> 00:36:03,266
And there's things he's done
that show a need for disclosure.

335
00:36:04,409 --> 00:36:06,274
He hasn't had a sympathetic ear.

336
00:36:06,311 --> 00:36:10,611
He wants someone to listen,
to try and understand him.

337
00:36:10,648 --> 00:36:13,412
Look,
I feel for this girl, I do...

338
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:17,319
but Stargher
may no longer know the truth.

339
00:36:17,355 --> 00:36:18,549
For severe schizophrenics...

340
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:21,286
there's no discerning
between fantasy and reality.

341
00:36:21,326 --> 00:36:22,725
Is it possible?

342
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,661
If he came to trust me, yes...

343
00:36:25,697 --> 00:36:27,665
but it takes months to earn
that kind of trust.

344
00:36:27,699 --> 00:36:29,894
Is it possible?

345
00:36:36,674 --> 00:36:38,699
Daddy?

346
00:36:40,311 --> 00:36:41,972
Come here...

347
00:36:42,013 --> 00:36:44,481
and save me! Save me!

348
00:36:53,892 --> 00:36:57,020
I'm daddy's girl.

349
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:16,608
His levels are too flat.

350
00:37:23,421 --> 00:37:25,321
What happened here?

351
00:37:25,356 --> 00:37:27,847
We removed fourteen steel rings.

352
00:37:32,897 --> 00:37:34,865
Should have left him
the way he was.

353
00:37:36,267 --> 00:37:38,258
He used to suspend him self, didn't he?

354
00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:43,301
They're comforted by
the feeling of weightlessness...

355
00:37:43,341 --> 00:37:45,332
like floating in water.

356
00:37:50,615 --> 00:37:53,743
Now, this, gentlemen,
is the catalyst.

357
00:37:53,785 --> 00:37:56,845
The neurological connectic
transfer system...

358
00:37:56,888 --> 00:37:59,322
not only maps the mind...

359
00:38:00,425 --> 00:38:02,359
it sends the signal
to another party.

360
00:38:02,393 --> 00:38:04,486
All you need to do is tune in...

361
00:38:04,529 --> 00:38:07,657
but you do much more
than tune in.

362
00:38:07,699 --> 00:38:09,599
You become part of the show.

363
00:38:14,739 --> 00:38:15,865
He's ready.

364
00:38:22,313 --> 00:38:23,905
Why are there three stations?

365
00:38:23,948 --> 00:38:26,280
For a while, we tried
joint the rapy sessions--

366
00:38:26,317 --> 00:38:27,682
two shrinks
for the price of one--

367
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:30,415
but Edward hated it
and only talked to Catherine.

368
00:38:30,455 --> 00:38:32,047
She has a gift.

369
00:38:48,606 --> 00:38:49,766
Are you sure?

370
00:38:53,578 --> 00:38:54,979
I'm sure.

371
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:57,038
OK.

372
00:39:05,423 --> 00:39:07,891
Response signal...

373
00:39:07,925 --> 00:39:09,017
functioning.

374
00:39:09,227 --> 00:39:13,031
We implanted a touch-sensitive
microchip in her hand...

375
00:39:13,031 --> 00:39:15,226
so if she wants
to stop the session...

376
00:39:15,266 --> 00:39:17,996
or if it gets too intense,
she can give the signal...

377
00:39:18,036 --> 00:39:19,526
and we abort.

378
00:39:32,817 --> 00:39:36,810
When we were ready
for practical testing...

379
00:39:36,854 --> 00:39:38,719
Miriam and l auditioned...

380
00:39:38,756 --> 00:39:40,986
some of the best child
therapists in the country.

381
00:39:41,025 --> 00:39:45,428
And all they did was observe
and report, nothing more.

382
00:39:46,831 --> 00:39:48,423
Catherine
was the least experienced...

383
00:39:48,466 --> 00:39:51,367
but she came
so highly recommended...

384
00:39:51,402 --> 00:39:54,064
that we decided, what the hell,
we'll give her a shot...

385
00:39:54,272 --> 00:39:56,263
and immediately,
we could tell she was different.

386
00:41:47,418 --> 00:41:49,579
You're not human.
You don't lie in my house.

387
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,383
You're an animal!

388
00:43:08,532 --> 00:43:09,726
Hey, you.

389
00:43:19,944 --> 00:43:21,969
Yeah, you like that, don't you?

390
00:43:24,782 --> 00:43:26,477
Is your name Carl?

391
00:43:28,085 --> 00:43:30,610
You know, l know another
little boy with a horse.

392
00:43:30,655 --> 00:43:31,986
His name's Edward.

393
00:43:32,023 --> 00:43:34,457
l mean the boy, not the horse.

394
00:43:55,713 --> 00:43:57,476
What's wrong?

395
00:45:01,779 --> 00:45:02,905
His victims.

396
00:47:50,814 --> 00:47:52,475
Where you come from?

397
00:48:07,331 --> 00:48:08,889
Gentlemen, she's back.

398
00:48:08,933 --> 00:48:10,366
I'll be right there.

399
00:48:23,447 --> 00:48:25,415
All right. Come on, Catherine.

400
00:48:28,852 --> 00:48:31,514
She's had quite a journey.

401
00:48:31,555 --> 00:48:33,580
Unlike anything
we've ever seen before.

402
00:48:33,624 --> 00:48:36,252
-So she's made contact?
-Oh, yes.

403
00:48:36,293 --> 00:48:38,557
She's gone very deep
into his world.

404
00:48:38,596 --> 00:48:39,688
At times too far.

405
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:41,527
It's cold.

406
00:48:41,565 --> 00:48:43,658
That can be dangerous.

407
00:48:43,701 --> 00:48:44,895
What are you talking about?

408
00:48:44,935 --> 00:48:48,894
Well, if she came to believe
that Stargher's world is real...

409
00:48:48,939 --> 00:48:52,397
then theoretically, her mind
could convince her body...

410
00:48:52,443 --> 00:48:54,934
that anything
that was done to it there...

411
00:48:54,979 --> 00:48:56,913
is actually done.

412
00:48:57,014 --> 00:48:59,881
It's like the old wives' tale
where you die in your dream...

413
00:48:59,917 --> 00:49:01,475
you die in real life.

414
00:49:01,518 --> 00:49:04,544
Henry, could you raise
the temperature in here, please?

415
00:49:04,588 --> 00:49:06,681
-Dr. Kent?
-Just a moment, please.

416
00:49:06,724 --> 00:49:08,659
Dr. Kent, can l come in there
and speak with you?

417
00:49:08,659 --> 00:49:10,490
We have to be patient.

418
00:49:10,527 --> 00:49:12,927
l mean, look at her.
She's drowsy.

419
00:49:12,963 --> 00:49:14,362
Let her wake up.

420
00:49:14,398 --> 00:49:17,799
We don't have a lot of time.
Do you understand that?

421
00:50:05,716 --> 00:50:09,015
Our father,
who art in heaven...

422
00:50:09,053 --> 00:50:11,044
hallowed be thy name.
