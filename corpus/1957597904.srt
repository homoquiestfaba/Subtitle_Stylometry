00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:00,214
Dick seemed to enjoy himself.

181
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:03,652
- [Dick] May 9th, 1924.

182
00:13:03,695 --> 00:13:05,523
Nathan rented a
gray Willys-Knight

183
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:07,569
at the Rent-a-Car
on South Michigan.

184
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:10,528
He used the name
Morton D. Ballard.

185
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:13,096
[soft instrumental music]

186
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,403
- [Partygoer] I asked you,

187
00:13:15,446 --> 00:13:16,926
are you still seeing
that longshoreman,

188
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,494
the one with all the
hair on his back?

189
00:13:19,537 --> 00:13:21,191
- [Partygoer] Of
course, darling.

190
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:23,106
You know, he's very wealthy.

191
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,282
- [Partygoer] And you know
that's what really matters.

192
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:27,807
[all laughing]

193
00:13:29,112 --> 00:13:32,333
- So, Jenny, how
do you play poker?

194
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:34,335
- Well, there's a
variety of poker games.

195
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:37,468
This one's called
five-card stud.

196
00:13:37,512 --> 00:13:38,643
- What is a stud?

197
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:42,952
- That's a stud.
- Oh. [laughing]

198
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:49,306
- I'm so tired of
this bloody card game.

199
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:53,441
[door latch clicking]

200
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:54,355
- Did you get the car?

201
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:55,530
- Yes.

202
00:13:55,573 --> 00:13:58,011
[keys clattering]

203
00:13:58,054 --> 00:13:58,838
- Don't start.

204
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:01,405
I waited around
for hours for you

205
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:03,364
when you went to get
the rope and the chisel.

206
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:08,586
- Oh, she's in a mood!
[all laughing]

207
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:13,374
- She's always in a mood.
[all laughing]

208
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,463
- [Partygoer] I know exactly
what you're talking about.

209
00:14:15,506 --> 00:14:17,857
[all laughing]

210
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:25,038
- Oh, no, forget it, pick it
up, pick it up, pick it up.

211
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:26,517
Start all over again.

212
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:28,302
Aces high, deuces wild,
jacks are bid at open.

213
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:30,173
Got it?
- I could use a jack.

214
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:32,828
- Girlfriend, you look
like you could use a jack.

215
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,655
You're flat.

216
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:38,921
- Well.

217
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:42,969
- [Nathan] I am small.

218
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:44,274
My heart is pure.

219
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:48,452
[man speaking foreign language]

220
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:50,019
- [Man] Repeat this
phrase at the tone.

221
00:14:50,063 --> 00:14:55,068
[phone beeping]
[speaking foreign language]

222
00:14:57,984 --> 00:14:59,942
- [Man] Repeat this

223
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:04,947
[phone beeping]
[speaking foreign language]

224
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,605
- [Man] Repeat this

225
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:15,653
[phone beeping]
[speaking foreign language]

226
00:15:27,143 --> 00:15:27,927
- Oscar Wilde.

227
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,016
Prince Eulenburg.

228
00:15:32,322 --> 00:15:33,454
Sir Roger Casement.

229
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,065
Marcel Proust.

230
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:39,025
E. M. Forster.

231
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:42,376
Frederick the Great.

232
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:45,422
[guests chattering]

233
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:38,258
[alarm clock ringing]

234
00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:41,522
Dick.

235
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:46,788
Dick, wake up.

236
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:50,966
Wake up.

237
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:56,537
We've gotta get it together.

238
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,061
I dreamt of the great
pharaohs of history.

239
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:01,803
Of slaves being whipped.
[whip cracking]

240
00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:03,587
I dreamed I was
an Egyptian king,

241
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:05,241
and Dickie was my slave boy.

242
00:17:06,155 --> 00:17:07,852
- Nathan fantasized

243
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:09,898
that he and Richard Loeb
were taking a sea voyage,

244
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:11,508
were wrecked on
an unknown island.

245
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:14,468
Patient was the
only one rescued,

246
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:16,644
was able to speak the
language of the natives.

247
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,647
[whip cracking]
A piano was rescued

248
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,954
in the wreck, and he was the
only one able to play upon it.

249
00:17:22,998 --> 00:17:25,914
No one on this island
knew anything of music.

250
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:28,656
The island natives were
divided into two groups:

251
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:30,919
kings and slaves.

252
00:17:30,962 --> 00:17:33,487
Nathan's companions
were all made slaves.

253
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:37,665
But because of the patient's
ability to make music

254
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,581
and speak the language,
he was named a king.

255
00:17:43,758 --> 00:17:46,108
He then purchased Richard
Loeb as his slave.

256
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:48,850
He draped him in chains.

257
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,811
He fantasized that Richard was
sick when he purchased him,

258
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:56,249
and that he would nurse
Richard back to health.

259
00:17:58,207 --> 00:18:00,427
He then offered
Richard three choices.

260
00:18:03,865 --> 00:18:06,302
- Yes, choices.

261
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:12,569
First of all, I
would set him free

262
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:16,530
and remove the
tattoo on his thigh.

263
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:19,315
- He had a tattoo on his thigh?

264
00:18:20,838 --> 00:18:22,362
- A tattoo.

265
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:24,103
We branded him in the
locker room at school.

266
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:30,587
His second option was to
remain my personal slave

267
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:32,111
in every sense of the word.

268
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:35,853
And his last choice
was to allow me

269
00:18:35,897 --> 00:18:38,073
to sell him to another king.

270
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:43,122
But if I did, the other
master would abuse him.

271
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:45,602
And Dickie would send
me secret messages

272
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:46,908
begging to come back home.

273
00:18:49,084 --> 00:18:50,825
He would sign our pet name.

274
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:53,436
- And what was that pet name?

275
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:56,526
- Kitten.

276
00:18:58,702 --> 00:18:59,442
Pussy.

277
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:10,034
[man whistling]

278
00:20:14,822 --> 00:20:17,738

[somber orchestral music]

280
00:20:34,494 --> 00:20:36,409
- [Dick] Bobby!

281
00:20:36,452 --> 00:20:37,975
Want a ride home?

282
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:39,760
- [Bobby] Yeah, sure.

283
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:44,068
- [Dick] Go ahead,
get in the front seat.

284
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:49,726
- [Nathan] Hello, Bobby.

285
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:52,033
- [Bobby] Hello.

286
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:56,298
[somber orchestral
music continues]

287
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:08,789

[tense orchestral music]

294
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:57,637
[soft orchestral music]

295
00:23:00,335 --> 00:23:01,945
- [Woman In Silk And
Pearls] Now I know you,

296
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:05,340
your dog-like nature
that adores being kicked,

297
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,995
and all the more, the
more it is maltreated.

298
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:10,824
Now I know you, and you
shall come to know me.

299
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:40,984
- Do you think we
should go back?

300
00:23:41,028 --> 00:23:41,855
- Relax, babe.

301
00:23:43,813 --> 00:23:46,642
It'll be more perfect if we
just drive straight through.

302
00:23:48,165 --> 00:23:50,124
Those idiots'll never
know what passed 'em.

303
00:23:51,995 --> 00:23:52,953
Honk the horn.

304
00:23:58,175 --> 00:24:00,526
[horn honking]

305
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:07,576
- Well, we went on out to
Leroy's fish and rib joint.

306
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,013
- [Man] All the way out there?

307
00:24:19,153 --> 00:24:21,590
[horn honking]

308
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:26,377
- Look here.
- Yep.

309
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:32,471
- [Man] Who are they?

310
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:34,255
Who are they?

311
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:35,735
- [Man] All right, get back
to work, get back to work.

312
00:24:35,778 --> 00:24:37,301
- [Man] Man, last time
I seen such a pretty boy

313
00:24:37,345 --> 00:24:41,218
like that out here-
[shovel scraping]

314
00:24:56,973 --> 00:24:57,757
- Get out.

315
00:25:10,857 --> 00:25:12,641
Oh, he's dead all
right. [laughs]

316
00:25:12,685 --> 00:25:14,034
He's getting stiff already.

317

[lighter clicking]

318
00:25:58,426 --> 00:26:00,950
Grab the shoes and the shovel.

- Nathan?

326
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,473
You boys need help with that?

327
00:31:08,127 --> 00:31:08,910
- No.

328
00:31:08,954 --> 00:31:11,565
No, we're fine.

329
00:31:11,608 --> 00:31:13,741
Wine, we just spilled some wine.

330
00:31:18,224 --> 00:31:19,007
- Wait, Sven.

331
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:21,096
Come here.

332
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:30,279
You've just enjoyed the treat

333
00:31:30,323 --> 00:31:31,890
of shaking hands
with a murderer.

334

[soft tense music]

336
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:54,086
So you want to go
out for a drink?

337
00:31:54,129 --> 00:31:55,739
- [Nathan] Look,
didn't I just tell you?

338
00:31:55,783 --> 00:31:57,263
What do I have to say to you?

339
00:31:59,265 --> 00:32:01,310
- That's the last time
I take you any place.

340
00:32:01,354 --> 00:32:03,617
- Why don't you just shut up?

- Hello?

344
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:37,607
- Your son has been kidnapped.

345
00:32:39,566 --> 00:32:40,480
He is safe.

346
00:32:42,221 --> 00:32:44,179
There will be further
instructions in the morning.

347
00:32:44,223 --> 00:32:45,354
- Who is this?

348
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:47,443
What do you want?

349
00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:48,270
- Johnson.

350
00:33:08,812 --> 00:33:09,944
- Good night.

this letter was either

an amateur at
typing or a sadist.

359
00:36:09,471 --> 00:36:10,864
- May I help you, Mr. Leopold?

360
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:21,396
I have several new specimens
I'd like to show you.

361
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:26,749
- Oh, no, thank you,
I have to leave.

362
00:36:35,802 --> 00:36:37,673
- You see how some of the
letters are punched so hard

363
00:36:37,717 --> 00:36:39,762
they're almost driven
through the paper?

364
00:36:39,806 --> 00:36:41,721
Others were struck tentatively.

365
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:05,397
[bird calling]

366
00:37:07,573 --> 00:37:10,489
[soft tense music]

367
00:37:43,043 --> 00:37:45,785
[phone beeping]

368
00:37:49,484 --> 00:37:51,878
- This is Johnson,
listen closely.

369
00:37:51,921 --> 00:37:55,316
In 10 minutes, a car will
arrive at your house,

370
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,665
take you to the drugstore

371
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:58,624
on the corner of
Cottage Grove and 65th.

372
00:37:59,886 --> 00:38:01,409
There you will receive
further instructions.

373
00:38:01,453 --> 00:38:03,803
You must travel
alone, call no one.

374
00:38:06,675 --> 00:38:09,287
[both laughing]

375
00:38:10,897 --> 00:38:12,899
- What did he say?

376
00:38:12,942 --> 00:38:14,292
- I've forgotten the address.

377
00:38:16,903 --> 00:38:18,252
- [Announcer] Train
from Des Moines,

378
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,994
arriving on track
six, all aboard.

379
00:38:28,436 --> 00:38:30,351
- Do you think we've
waited long enough?

380
00:38:30,395 --> 00:38:32,048
- Yeah.

381
00:38:32,092 --> 00:38:33,833
Even if the traffic were
bad, he'd be there by now.

382
00:38:52,112 --> 00:38:53,461
- [Man] Hello?

383
00:38:53,505 --> 00:38:56,421
- Hello, is this the
Cottage Grove Drugstore?

384
00:38:56,464 --> 00:38:57,378
- [Man] Yes, it is.

385
00:38:58,248 --> 00:38:59,598
- [Nathan] Would you see

386
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:00,860
if there's a Mr.
Franks in the store?

387
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:02,383
- [Man] I'm the only one here.

388
00:39:02,427 --> 00:39:04,733
- Just look.
- There's no one in the store.

389
00:39:05,908 --> 00:39:07,040
- Are you certain?

390
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:08,781
- [Man] Yeah, pal, I'm certain.

391
00:39:27,669 --> 00:39:28,931
- Where are your glasses, babe?

392
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,596
[soft music]

393
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,424
- [Announcer] Police go
undercover in an attempt

394
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:46,514
to apprehend the degenerate
kidnapper of Bobby Franks.

395
00:39:46,558 --> 00:39:49,691
The mayor has declared a
city-wide state of emergency.

396
00:39:49,735 --> 00:39:51,911
Police are desperately
searching for the owner

397
00:39:51,954 --> 00:39:54,914
of the eyeglasses found
at the scene of the crime.

398
00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:56,350
They announced that
the ransom letter

399
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,873
was typed on an
Underwood portable.

400
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:01,703
They suspect bootleggers,
dope fiends, or perverts

401
00:40:01,747 --> 00:40:03,270
are responsible for the murder.

402
00:40:05,011 --> 00:40:07,013
At Hartford School for Boys,

403
00:40:07,056 --> 00:40:09,668
bachelor schoolteachers were
taken in for questioning.

404
00:40:11,234 --> 00:40:14,716
- I would ask everyone in
Chicago to look around him,

405
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,979
and to note whether

406
00:40:17,023 --> 00:40:20,592
neighbors, friends,
acquaintances

407
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:24,160
showed signs of muddy
clothes, shoes and so forth.

408
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,076
Or muddy and dirty automobiles.

409
00:40:28,817 --> 00:40:31,994
And who was away from their
usual haunt and calling

410
00:40:32,038 --> 00:40:33,605
on Wednesday
afternoon and night.

411
00:40:34,606 --> 00:40:36,042
- I think whoever did it

412
00:40:36,085 --> 00:40:37,739
should be tarred,
feathered, and hung.

413
00:40:39,524 --> 00:40:41,177
- I agree completely.

414
00:40:41,221 --> 00:40:44,006
Whoever did this
must be some kind of

415
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:46,531
deranged pervert, to kill
a little boy like that.

416
00:40:47,923 --> 00:40:48,663
- Absolutely.

417
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:54,930
- I still can't believe
it, what a terrible loss.

418
00:40:55,931 --> 00:40:56,671
- It is.

419
00:40:57,846 --> 00:40:58,847
- May I be excused?

420
00:41:01,415 --> 00:41:02,721
- What for this time?

421
00:41:04,374 --> 00:41:06,986
- I just remembered, I have
to stop by Nathan's house.

422
00:41:08,683 --> 00:41:10,163
- Again?

423
00:41:10,206 --> 00:41:10,990
- Yes, again.

424
00:41:56,252 --> 00:41:59,038
[hammer banging]

425
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,781
- What the hell are you doing?

426
00:42:07,786 --> 00:42:09,309
How did you get in here, anyway?

427
00:42:14,053 --> 00:42:16,142
- You wanna get
caught, don't you?

428
00:42:16,185 --> 00:42:18,579
If you could get pregnant,
you would, wouldn't you?

429
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,932
It's a typewriter, babe,
it's a fucking typewriter.

430
00:42:23,976 --> 00:42:25,934
They can trace the letter.

431
00:42:25,978 --> 00:42:28,589
They can find us because
you lost your glasses.

432
00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:30,330
- No.

433
00:42:30,373 --> 00:42:34,421
No way, they're common, the
frame, the prescription.

434
00:42:36,292 --> 00:42:38,164
I mean if you think I
should go to the police

435
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:41,080
and claim them, it's fine,
I have the perfect alibi.

436
00:42:41,123 --> 00:42:42,472
I took my birding
class there Monday.

437
00:42:42,516 --> 00:42:43,909
- [Dick] No, no.

438
00:42:43,952 --> 00:42:45,519
I just got excited.

439
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,303
Put it in the box, no
one will recognize it.

440
00:42:52,961 --> 00:42:54,702
- There's also that
rug in the trunk.

441
00:42:56,138 --> 00:42:57,139
Go for a drive?

442
00:42:57,183 --> 00:42:57,966
- One condition.

443
00:42:58,967 --> 00:43:00,012
I drive.

444
00:43:00,055 --> 00:43:01,274
- Fine.

445
00:43:01,317 --> 00:43:02,580
Great, just don't kill me.

446
00:43:09,412 --> 00:43:12,546
- You lucky shit, I can't
believe you're leaving.

447
00:43:13,678 --> 00:43:14,461
- Neither can I.

448
00:43:17,246 --> 00:43:20,293
I shall sail on the
Mauritania to Europe.

449
00:43:20,336 --> 00:43:22,948
I'll spend the ransom
money in casinos, drinking.

450
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:26,212
I'll visit all the great cities.

451
00:43:26,255 --> 00:43:29,389
I shall return to
Harvard, become a lawyer,

452
00:43:29,432 --> 00:43:31,609
get married and raise a family.

453
00:43:31,652 --> 00:43:34,612
[ship horn blaring]

454
00:43:39,007 --> 00:43:43,098
[water splashing]
[dog barking]

455
00:43:43,142 --> 00:43:45,753
- [Dick] May 23rd, 1924.

456
00:43:45,797 --> 00:43:48,190
Destroyed the typewriter,
burned the shoes,

457
00:43:48,234 --> 00:43:51,846
hid the chisel, burned
the rug and the clothing.

458
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,326
I think we're finally finished.

459
00:44:00,202 --> 00:44:03,118
[flames blazing]

460
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:15,304
[distant train horn blaring]

461
00:44:20,527 --> 00:44:23,791
[ominous string music]

462
00:44:31,364 --> 00:44:33,148
- [Nathan] May 23rd, 1924.

463
00:44:34,236 --> 00:44:35,629
Kelly and Bobby Franks together

464
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,283
would join Richard
and I for life.

465
00:44:42,244 --> 00:44:45,030
I wanted to murder the idea
of suffering as my condition.

466
00:44:54,474 --> 00:44:56,694
I wanted to surpass the
boundaries of intelligence

467
00:44:56,737 --> 00:44:58,130
for something more pure.

468
00:45:03,918 --> 00:45:07,008
[soft ominous music]

469
00:45:27,463 --> 00:45:31,598
- [Man] So, you would say that
you're absolutely positive

470
00:45:31,641 --> 00:45:34,253
these glasses do
not belong to you?

471
00:45:34,296 --> 00:45:35,645
- [Nathan] Yes.

472
00:45:35,689 --> 00:45:36,603
- [Man] And you're
certain of that.

473
00:45:36,646 --> 00:45:37,343
- [Nathan] Definitely.

474
00:45:37,386 --> 00:45:38,257
- [Man] Why?

475
00:45:42,522 --> 00:45:44,132
- [Nathan] Those
are not my glasses.

476
00:45:44,176 --> 00:45:45,264
- These are not yours?

477
00:45:46,569 --> 00:45:48,528
Very common frame,
everyone has them, right?

478
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:55,535
Let's see, you bought these
from Albert Coe and company

479
00:45:57,319 --> 00:46:02,281
on May 24, 1923.

480
00:46:05,327 --> 00:46:07,416
The hinges, Mr. Leopold,

481
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,549
the hinges are newly
patented, rare.

482
00:46:09,592 --> 00:46:12,639
Only three pairs sold in
Chicago with your frames.

483
00:46:14,423 --> 00:46:18,427
In fact, here's a
copy of your receipt.

484
00:46:18,471 --> 00:46:19,254
- Well, Nathan,

485
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:22,736
I suppose Detective Savage
would like to accompany you

486
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,564
to your house to
find these glasses.

487
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,263
- Let's go.

488
00:46:43,322 --> 00:46:45,324
[phone ringing]

489
00:46:45,367 --> 00:46:48,544
[elevator bell dinging]

490
00:46:52,505 --> 00:46:55,203
- Is everything all right?
- I believe so.

491
00:46:56,596 --> 00:46:59,294
Your brother was going to
show us his pair of glasses.

492
00:47:00,252 --> 00:47:01,688
- Babe, are you all right?

493
00:47:01,731 --> 00:47:03,516
Do you need a lawyer?

494
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:04,909
- I'm fine, Mike.

495
00:47:04,952 --> 00:47:06,171
I have nothing to hide.

496
00:47:10,218 --> 00:47:13,831
[quirky instrumental music]

497
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:16,137
- The girls' names again?

498
00:47:18,574 --> 00:47:19,619
- Edna and May.

499
00:47:22,056 --> 00:47:23,753
- What did they look like?

500
00:47:23,797 --> 00:47:25,494
- [Nathan] Edna had red
hair, May was a brunette.

501
00:47:25,538 --> 00:47:27,366
- Exactly where did
you pick them up?

502
00:47:28,497 --> 00:47:30,717
- 18th and Roosevelt Road.

503
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,805
- What time was it?

504
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,198
- [Dick] About six o'clock.

505
00:47:33,241 --> 00:47:34,721
- What exactly did
you do with them?

506
00:47:34,764 --> 00:47:36,375
- We went for a drive.

507
00:47:37,506 --> 00:47:39,552
- Whose car were you driving?

508
00:47:39,595 --> 00:47:41,423
- My car.

509
00:47:41,467 --> 00:47:43,208
- Did you engage in any sexual
relations with these girls?

510
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:46,994
- Yes, we did.

511
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,389
- Where did you drop
the young ladies off?

512
00:47:50,432 --> 00:47:51,869
- Back at 18th Street.

513
00:47:53,435 --> 00:47:54,610
- What time was that?

514
00:47:55,568 --> 00:47:57,396
- About 8:15.

515
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:00,616
- Did you engage in any sexual
relations with these girls?

516
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,053
- Yes, we did.

517
00:48:02,096 --> 00:48:03,532
- Where did you say you
went, in Lincoln Park?

518
00:48:03,576 --> 00:48:04,403
- In the rookery.

519
00:48:05,578 --> 00:48:07,101
And we looked at birds.

520
00:48:07,145 --> 00:48:08,537
- What kind of birds
did you see, Richard?

521
00:48:08,581 --> 00:48:10,757
- I don't know, Nathan's
the ornithologist.

522
00:48:11,627 --> 00:48:12,933
- What'd you have for dinner?

523
00:48:12,977 --> 00:48:14,021
- How much did
you have to drink?

524
00:48:14,065 --> 00:48:15,066
- What time did you get home?

525
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:17,111
- I said, one o'clock.

526
00:48:17,155 --> 00:48:18,417
- Who was there?

527
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,244
- My father.

528
00:48:20,419 --> 00:48:22,421
- How late did your
father stay up?

529
00:48:22,464 --> 00:48:24,640
- At what time did
you take Richard home?

530
00:48:24,684 --> 00:48:26,599
- Whose car were you driving?

531
00:48:26,642 --> 00:48:27,992
- My car.

532
00:48:28,035 --> 00:48:29,863
- What time was that?
- Six o'clock.

533
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:33,693
- The girls names, again?

534
00:48:37,218 --> 00:48:38,480
- Did they say why
they took him in?

535
00:48:38,524 --> 00:48:41,266
- They think the
glasses are his.

536
00:48:41,309 --> 00:48:42,789
It's impossible, Dad.

537
00:48:42,832 --> 00:48:43,921
It's a mistake.

538
00:48:47,098 --> 00:48:47,925
- That's right.

539
00:48:49,013 --> 00:48:49,796
A mistake.

540
00:49:01,503 --> 00:49:02,983
- Excuse me.

541
00:49:03,027 --> 00:49:03,853
Pardon me.

542
00:49:05,029 --> 00:49:07,161
I've brought pajamas
for the young man.

543
00:49:07,205 --> 00:49:08,902
If you're gonna
keep him overnight.

544
00:49:10,034 --> 00:49:12,036
- Yeah, fine, put them down.

545
00:49:37,235 --> 00:49:38,671
- You know, I'm certain

546
00:49:38,714 --> 00:49:40,238
they have nothing to
do with the crime.

547
00:49:41,848 --> 00:49:43,676
They couldn't have
driven anywhere.

548
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:45,112
Least of all that swamp.

549
00:49:46,722 --> 00:49:50,988
I know, I was fixing young Mr.
Leopold's car in the garage.

550
00:49:51,031 --> 00:49:51,814
- You were?

551
00:49:52,902 --> 00:49:53,773
- Absolutely.

552
00:50:13,271 --> 00:50:18,232
[children chattering]
[soft music]

553
00:50:18,841 --> 00:50:20,278
- Richard Loeb?

554
00:50:20,321 --> 00:50:21,105
Come with me.

555
00:50:35,684 --> 00:50:38,470
[clock chiming]

556
00:50:55,008 --> 00:50:56,314
- Richard.

557
00:50:56,357 --> 00:50:57,097
- Yes?

558
00:50:58,142 --> 00:50:59,360
- Your alibi is a lie.

559
00:51:01,232 --> 00:51:03,060
There was no Edna, and no May.

560
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,499
You and Mr. Leopold did
not go looking for birds

561
00:51:07,542 --> 00:51:09,588
in Lincoln Park,
just one small boy.

562
00:51:13,592 --> 00:51:16,334
Oh, Nathan's family's
chauffeur just dropped off

563
00:51:16,377 --> 00:51:18,336
some pajamas for the evening.

564
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:22,949
He mentioned, he's
absolutely certain that

565
00:51:22,992 --> 00:51:24,342
he was working on Nathan's car

566
00:51:24,385 --> 00:51:25,778
the day of the murder.

567
00:51:28,868 --> 00:51:30,391
- He said that?

568
00:51:30,435 --> 00:51:31,175
- [Man] Yes.

569
00:51:53,806 --> 00:51:55,199
- Go ahead, eat.

570
00:51:55,242 --> 00:51:56,722
It's from the Berghof.

571
00:51:56,765 --> 00:51:57,636
- I'm not hungry.

572
00:51:59,681 --> 00:52:01,640
This was completely his idea.

573
00:52:02,989 --> 00:52:03,990
He's very clever.

574
00:52:05,513 --> 00:52:06,253
- Who?

575
00:52:08,212 --> 00:52:09,343
- Nathan.

576
00:52:09,387 --> 00:52:10,605
Nathan did all of this.

577
00:52:14,522 --> 00:52:16,829
He invented the fake names.

578
00:52:16,872 --> 00:52:19,310
He was Morton G. Ballard,
I was Louis Mason.

579
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:25,881
We rented a hotel
room, for the address,

580
00:52:25,925 --> 00:52:28,536
and then went to the
Rent-a-Car on Joliet

581
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,929
and used the assumed names.

582
00:52:31,452 --> 00:52:33,150
I think I got that idea
from a detective magazine.

583
00:52:33,193 --> 00:52:35,674
But he made the phone calls
and he rented the car.

584
00:52:36,936 --> 00:52:39,373
- Where'd you get the
money for the car?

585
00:52:39,417 --> 00:52:40,461
And the hotel room?

586
00:52:42,898 --> 00:52:43,725
- My allowance.

587
00:52:45,945 --> 00:52:48,034
- Why'd you kill Bobby Franks?

588
00:52:48,077 --> 00:52:50,732
- I didn't kill Bobby Franks.

589
00:52:50,776 --> 00:52:51,690
Nathan did.

590
00:52:56,085 --> 00:52:56,825
I don't know.

591
00:52:59,872 --> 00:53:01,830
He was a friend of
my little brother's.

592
00:53:02,918 --> 00:53:05,138
Nathan wanted a little boy.

593
00:53:07,923 --> 00:53:10,230
He wanted Johnny Levinson.

594
00:53:10,274 --> 00:53:12,276
But we couldn't
find him that day.

595
00:53:13,581 --> 00:53:16,932
He said his father was
the richest Jew in town.

596
00:53:16,976 --> 00:53:19,196
- Both you boys are Jewish.

597
00:53:19,239 --> 00:53:20,022
- Yes.

598
00:53:22,982 --> 00:53:24,331
It was the money.

599
00:53:26,899 --> 00:53:30,729
You know, we knew the Franks
lived down in Hyde Park,

600
00:53:31,991 --> 00:53:33,906
so we knew they
could get the cash.

601
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:36,996
- And after you finished,
and you had the ransom,

602
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:38,389
what were you going to do?

603
00:53:40,826 --> 00:53:41,696
- Nothing.

604
00:53:43,394 --> 00:53:46,484
Nathan was supposed to sail
to Europe for the summer.

605
00:53:47,789 --> 00:53:51,532
He was supposed to leave
today, in fact. [chuckles]

606
00:53:51,576 --> 00:53:54,013
I didn't care as
much about the money.

607
00:53:55,188 --> 00:53:56,189
It was the planning.

608
00:53:57,843 --> 00:53:58,887
It was all going so well,

609
00:53:58,931 --> 00:53:59,758
up until the end.

610
00:54:02,151 --> 00:54:03,762
Do you read detective magazines?

611
00:54:05,807 --> 00:54:06,591
- No.

612
00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:16,731
Oh, yeah, what about the
Rent-a-Car in Joliet?

613
00:54:18,342 --> 00:54:21,736
What about your assumed
identity, Mr. Morton D. Ballard?

614
00:54:22,998 --> 00:54:24,783
Who do you think told
me about Louis Mason?

615
00:54:30,919 --> 00:54:33,661
Your friend says you're the
one who killed Bobby Franks.

616
00:54:35,054 --> 00:54:37,796
[Nathan exhaling]

617
00:54:42,844 --> 00:54:44,019
- Get a stenographer.

618
00:54:53,725 --> 00:54:55,204
- You're aware that
there's some kind of talk

619
00:54:55,248 --> 00:54:58,817
that the two of you had
homosexual relations.

620
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,209
- Yes, sir.

621
00:55:00,253 --> 00:55:02,081
- And you're aware
of the fact that

622
00:55:02,124 --> 00:55:04,692
you're thought to be the
aggressor, in this relationship.

623
00:55:04,736 --> 00:55:06,128
- Yes, sir.

624
00:55:06,172 --> 00:55:08,783
- Which, as a matter
of fact, was the truth.

625
00:55:08,827 --> 00:55:09,610
- Yes.

626
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:19,316
- Now, in your original plan,

627
00:55:20,665 --> 00:55:21,927
did you have anyone...

628
00:55:23,842 --> 00:55:26,061
Did you have anyone
to be the victim?

629
00:55:27,585 --> 00:55:29,674
- Nobody in particular.

630
00:55:29,717 --> 00:55:31,371
- When did you
choose Bobby Franks?

631
00:55:32,633 --> 00:55:35,593
- When we saw him,
by pure accident.

632
00:55:40,249 --> 00:55:43,252
- Now, this letter that
you already prepared,

633
00:55:43,296 --> 00:55:46,865
and the envelope and the
address where to deliver it-

634
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,389
- Yes.

635
00:55:49,433 --> 00:55:50,738
- When did you, exactly,
write that letter?

636
00:55:50,782 --> 00:55:51,870
- The day before.

637
00:55:53,524 --> 00:55:54,873
- And who was it addressed to?

638
00:55:55,917 --> 00:55:57,963
- To no one, just "Dear Sir."

639
00:55:59,443 --> 00:56:02,010
- Oh, so, it was after,
that you chose Bobby Franks,

640
00:56:02,054 --> 00:56:03,925
that you addressed the letter.

641
00:56:03,969 --> 00:56:04,752
- Yes.

642
00:56:07,929 --> 00:56:09,540
- Now,

643
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:10,367
later,

644
00:56:12,064 --> 00:56:13,021
in the swamp.

645
00:56:14,545 --> 00:56:18,070
How did you attempt to conceal
the body in the culvert?

646
00:56:18,113 --> 00:56:20,464
- I think it was headfirst.

647
00:56:20,507 --> 00:56:22,204
I had a pair of rubber boots.

648
00:56:26,818 --> 00:56:29,951
- Was it much of a job,
to push the body in?

649
00:56:31,823 --> 00:56:34,042
- At first I didn't
think it would fit.

650
00:56:34,086 --> 00:56:36,697
But then after I started,
it wasn't very hard at all.

651
00:56:36,741 --> 00:56:37,611
- Oh.

652
00:56:37,655 --> 00:56:38,351
- Richard helped me.

653
00:56:40,309 --> 00:56:42,529
- And so you pushed in as far
as you could with your hands,

654
00:56:42,573 --> 00:56:45,097
and then you used your
feet to push it in further.

655
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:46,098
- Yes.

656
00:56:47,752 --> 00:56:50,668
[knocking on door]

657
00:57:01,548 --> 00:57:02,462
Hello, Dad.

658
00:57:03,681 --> 00:57:06,292
- I would advise my son
to say nothing more.

659
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,431
- "We turned the corner.

660
00:57:14,474 --> 00:57:15,257
Mr. Leo,

661
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,477
Mr. Loeb

662
00:57:19,523 --> 00:57:22,395
put his hand over Bobby's mouth,

663
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,789
and hit him over the
head with his chisel.

664
00:57:25,877 --> 00:57:28,096
Bobby started to scream,

665
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:31,404
so Richard seized him and
pulled him into the back seat.

666
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:35,408
He forced a cloth in his mouth."

667
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:38,324
Apparently the boy died of
suffocation shortly after.

668
00:57:40,718 --> 00:57:43,068
- Would you please read
Mr. Loeb's statement now?

669
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:48,029
- I was driving.

670
00:57:48,073 --> 00:57:50,989
Mr. Leopold was
in the back seat.

671
00:57:51,032 --> 00:57:52,512
I stopped the car

672
00:57:52,556 --> 00:57:54,993
and asked Bobby if he
wanted a ride home.

673
00:57:56,037 --> 00:57:57,996
He got in the front seat.

674
00:57:58,039 --> 00:58:00,520
Mr. Leopold grabbed his mouth

675
00:58:00,564 --> 00:58:02,435
and hit him over the
head several times

676
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:06,004
with his chisel, I do not
know the exact number.

677
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:11,052
He began to bleed and was
not entirely conscious.

678
00:58:11,096 --> 00:58:12,010
He was moaning.

679
00:58:16,275 --> 00:58:18,233
- Okay, fine, I have
some corrections.

680
00:58:20,409 --> 00:58:21,889
First of all, we
started planning this

681
00:58:21,933 --> 00:58:24,370
as early as November, 1923.

682
00:58:24,413 --> 00:58:27,460
In the second place, the
suggestion was his, not mine.

683
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:32,465
The Rent-a-Car is not at
14th Street but at 16th.

684
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,337
I did not buy the chisel
with tape, he did.

685
00:58:38,036 --> 00:58:40,691
The rubber boots are not
my brother's, but my own.

686
00:58:42,257 --> 00:58:44,129
At the time the Franks
boy entered our car,

687
00:58:44,172 --> 00:58:46,392
I was driving, not Mr. Loeb.

688
00:58:46,435 --> 00:58:48,046
Mr. Loeb was in the back seat.

689
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:52,224
It was Mr. Loeb who struck
Bobby Franks on the head

690
00:58:52,267 --> 00:58:54,139
with the chisel, not I.

691
00:58:54,182 --> 00:58:56,881
Mr. Loeb returned to
his home at one o'clock,

692
00:58:56,924 --> 00:58:58,752
not 10:30, as he seems to think.

693
00:59:00,667 --> 00:59:02,060
- No, I never said that,

694
00:59:02,103 --> 00:59:03,844
I said I went to
your house at 10:30.

695
00:59:06,847 --> 00:59:09,197
There are certain corrections
that Leopold had made

696
00:59:09,241 --> 00:59:10,721
that are not important.

697
00:59:11,678 --> 00:59:13,593
Such as, 14th Street.

698
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:15,856
And the boots being his
instead of his brother's,

699
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,379
which doesn't amount to a damn.

700
00:59:19,077 --> 00:59:20,557
He wrapped the chisel, not me.

701
00:59:22,515 --> 00:59:24,256
And he doesn't mention
the original plan

702
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:26,214
to use ether to
kill Bobby Franks.

703
00:59:26,258 --> 00:59:27,955
He was supposed to do that.

704
00:59:27,999 --> 00:59:29,522
'Cause I don't know a
damn thing about it,

705
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:32,351
he chloroforms birds
and things like that.

706
00:59:32,394 --> 00:59:33,787
He knows ornithology,

707
00:59:33,831 --> 00:59:35,093
and I don't know a
damn thing about it.

708
00:59:37,748 --> 00:59:38,575
He did it.

709
00:59:40,272 --> 00:59:41,534
Nathan Leopold Junior.

710
00:59:43,188 --> 00:59:44,450
He was up in the front seat.

711
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,888
I said he was up
in the front seat.

712
00:59:47,932 --> 00:59:49,107
I mean I was up
in the front seat.

713
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:53,720
It's obviously a mistake,
I'm getting excited.

714
00:59:56,549 --> 00:59:58,029
Look, I tried to help you out,

715
00:59:58,072 --> 00:59:59,334
because I thought if
worse comes to worse,

716
00:59:59,378 --> 01:00:00,814
you'd admit what you had done

717
01:00:00,858 --> 01:00:02,294
and not try to drag
me into this thing.

718
01:00:05,471 --> 01:00:06,777
That's all I have to say.

719
01:00:13,784 --> 01:00:15,568
- Those are all absurd lies.

720
01:00:21,052 --> 01:00:22,967
He's trying to get
out of this mess.

721
01:00:25,404 --> 01:00:28,407
I was driving the car,
I'm absolutely positive.

722
01:00:37,242 --> 01:00:38,896
I'm sorry that you
were made a fool of,

723
01:00:38,939 --> 01:00:42,682
and broke down and ruined
everything and all that.

724
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:45,163
I am sorry, but it
wasn't my fault.

725
01:00:50,864 --> 01:00:53,519
[whip cracking]
[gavel banging]

726
01:00:53,562 --> 01:00:56,391
[soft tense music]

727
01:01:45,832 --> 01:01:48,922
[flashbulb popping]

728
01:01:48,966 --> 01:01:51,316
- Richard, what
about your family?

729
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:53,013
- My mother doesn't believe it.

730
01:01:54,493 --> 01:01:57,322
Even now, I'm sure she
doesn't think I did it.

731
01:01:57,365 --> 01:01:58,236
That hurts.

732
01:01:59,498 --> 01:02:02,370
A mother's faith, a
disgrace to my family.

733
01:02:02,414 --> 01:02:04,068
[flashbulb popping]

734
01:02:04,111 --> 01:02:05,765
I could've carried this secret

735
01:02:05,809 --> 01:02:08,899
in my mind the rest of my
life, it didn't bother me much.

736
01:02:08,942 --> 01:02:10,814
A thought or two at
times, that's all.

737
01:02:12,337 --> 01:02:15,122
- Today, the amazing
case of Angel-face Loeb

738
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:16,950
and Mastermind
Leopold will be heard

739
01:02:16,994 --> 01:02:19,605
before Judge William Caverly
in Chicago City Court.

740
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,784
Veteran defense
attorney Clarence Darrow

741
01:02:24,828 --> 01:02:28,092
avoided the jury by admitting
the guilt of his clients.

742
01:02:28,135 --> 01:02:31,138
After Sigmund Freud declined
to examine the boys,

743
01:02:31,182 --> 01:02:33,445
Darrow hired the best
alienists in the country

744
01:02:33,488 --> 01:02:35,229
to study the deranged duo.

745
01:02:36,535 --> 01:02:38,232
- This compact existed
for over a year.

746
01:02:39,277 --> 01:02:40,365
Do you want me to be specific?

747
01:02:40,408 --> 01:02:41,714
- [Clarence] Absolutely.

748
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,020
- [Judge] You may proceed.

749
01:02:44,978 --> 01:02:46,545
- Nathan was to
have the privilege

750
01:02:46,588 --> 01:02:48,373
of inserting his penis
between Dickie's legs,

751
01:02:48,416 --> 01:02:50,418
[crowd exclaiming]
at special dates.

752
01:02:50,462 --> 01:02:52,681
At one time this was to
be three times in a month,

753
01:02:52,725 --> 01:02:55,554
if they continued
their criminalistic
activities together.

754
01:02:55,597 --> 01:02:57,425
Later they had a
tremendous fight,

755
01:02:57,469 --> 01:02:59,427
and then it was
once for each crime.

756
01:02:59,471 --> 01:03:03,301
- Your Honor, I do not
suppose this should be taken

757
01:03:03,344 --> 01:03:05,346
in the presence of
reporters or women.

758
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:07,827
- [State's Attorney] He's
your witness, Mr. Darrow.

759
01:03:07,871 --> 01:03:10,395
People have a right to know
about their perversions.

760
01:03:10,438 --> 01:03:12,049
- Sustained.

761
01:03:12,092 --> 01:03:14,355
I want this court
cleared of women.

762
01:03:14,399 --> 01:03:16,401
[women exclaiming]

763
01:03:16,444 --> 01:03:17,968
[gavel banging]

764
01:03:18,011 --> 01:03:20,318
I want every woman to
leave this courtroom.

765
01:03:23,625 --> 01:03:25,279
[gavel banging]

766
01:03:25,323 --> 01:03:27,760
I have asked the ladies to
leave, now I want you to leave.

767
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,762
If you do not, I
will ask the bailiffs

768
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:32,547
to escort you into the hallway.

769
01:03:32,591 --> 01:03:34,332
There's nothing left here

770
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:37,074
except a lot of stuff that
is not fit for you to hear.

771
01:03:37,117 --> 01:03:40,033
[crowd chattering]

772
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,611
[gavel banging]

773
01:04:05,102 --> 01:04:10,107
[gavel banging]
[soft orchestral music]

774
01:04:11,412 --> 01:04:15,416
You are permitted to go
into every detail, Doctor.

775
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:17,114
- Where was I?

776
01:04:17,157 --> 01:04:19,551
- You were discussing
Dickie and Babe's pathology.

777
01:04:19,594 --> 01:04:21,422
- Your Honor, if the
defense is proposing

778
01:04:21,466 --> 01:04:23,424
that thees bloodless
murderers are insane,

779
01:04:23,468 --> 01:04:24,425
I call for a jury.

780
01:04:24,469 --> 01:04:25,557
- Overruled.

781
01:04:28,081 --> 01:04:29,517
Continue, Doctor Bowman.

782
01:04:30,954 --> 01:04:32,912
- They experimented
with mouth perversions.

783
01:04:32,956 --> 01:04:34,783
Nathan has many fantasies.

784
01:04:36,568 --> 01:04:38,222
I would like to say

785
01:04:38,265 --> 01:04:41,399
that this whole thing is
just an absurd situation,

786
01:04:41,442 --> 01:04:42,922
because there's nothing

787
01:04:42,966 --> 01:04:44,750
but putting his penis
his friend's legs

788
01:04:44,793 --> 01:04:46,883
and experiencing some
sort of a thrill.

789
01:04:46,926 --> 01:04:49,146
He says he gets gets
excited anticipating it.

790
01:04:49,189 --> 01:04:50,408
Dickie would
pretend to be drunk,

791
01:04:50,451 --> 01:04:51,583
and Babe would undress him.

792
01:04:51,626 --> 01:04:53,063
- [State's Attorney] I object,

793
01:04:53,106 --> 01:04:54,716
these killers are
grown men, Your Honor.

794
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,980
Not Dickie and Babe,
for God's sakes.

795
01:04:57,023 --> 01:04:58,242
- Overruled.

796
01:04:59,373 --> 01:05:01,288
Continue, Dr. Bowman.

797
01:05:01,332 --> 01:05:03,160
- [Dr. Bowman] Babe
blackmailed Dickie

798
01:05:03,203 --> 01:05:05,031
with his knowledge
of other crimes.

799
01:05:05,075 --> 01:05:06,337
He threatened him with exposure

800
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:07,816
if Dickie did not submit to it.

801
01:05:09,383 --> 01:05:11,385
And Dickie had to go
along with Leopold.

802
01:05:12,691 --> 01:05:14,040
[gavel banging]

803
01:05:14,084 --> 01:05:17,130
- They stripped the
body as planned,

804
01:05:17,174 --> 01:05:21,091
poured hydrochloric acid
over the face, penis,

805
01:05:21,134 --> 01:05:24,485
and an identifying
scar on the abdomen.

806
01:05:24,529 --> 01:05:28,881
Some of the hydrochloric
acid ran into the mouth,

807
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:31,579
discoloring the face.

808
01:05:31,623 --> 01:05:36,454
They hoped the acid would
dissolve the boy's identity.

809
01:05:38,325 --> 01:05:40,675
Richard said he had a brother

810
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:43,591
who had a peculiarly
shaped penis, he thought.

811
01:05:44,766 --> 01:05:48,422
And it was that feeling
that made him think

812
01:05:48,466 --> 01:05:52,513
of using this method to
prevent identification.

813
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,648
- His first actual
sex experience,

814
01:05:56,691 --> 01:05:59,477
namely, the use, or
misuse, of his organ,

815
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,828
was on a boy, Henry, two
years older than himself.

816
01:06:02,871 --> 01:06:05,091
He masturbated by rubbing
his genitals with a towel,

817
01:06:05,135 --> 01:06:08,138
producing an erection
and ejaculation.

818
01:06:10,792 --> 01:06:12,490
This quite interested
the patient.

819
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:16,059
The two boys saved the
discharge and put it in a jar.

820
01:06:17,451 --> 01:06:18,975
Later, they lost interest in it.

821
01:06:20,498 --> 01:06:21,890
- Nathan, you have to admit,

822
01:06:21,934 --> 01:06:23,805
smart or not, you're
in a huge mess.

823
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:29,072
- Listen, I don't
feel sorry for myself.

824
01:06:29,115 --> 01:06:31,074
I did it and that's all.

825
01:06:31,117 --> 01:06:33,337
I feel terrible for my
father and my brothers,

826
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:34,512
but not for myself.

827
01:06:36,383 --> 01:06:38,168
Life is what we make it,

828
01:06:38,211 --> 01:06:40,474
and I appear to have made
mine exactly what it is today.

829
01:06:42,215 --> 01:06:43,695
[flashbulb popping]

830
01:06:43,738 --> 01:06:48,221
- At night, he would lie
on his side or stomach,

831
01:06:49,744 --> 01:06:53,052
with his arms under the
pillow, hugging the pillow,

832
01:06:53,096 --> 01:06:57,535
and he would notice
a warm smell,

833
01:06:57,578 --> 01:07:00,581
which would be partly
from the pillow,

834
01:07:00,625 --> 01:07:02,888
and partly from his own body.

835
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:07,545
He regarded this odor

836
01:07:07,588 --> 01:07:09,808
as extremely pleasant.

837
01:07:11,636 --> 01:07:13,551
At about the same time,

838
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:17,381
he developed a great love

839
01:07:17,424 --> 01:07:20,123
for the symmetry
of the human form.

840
01:07:21,863 --> 01:07:22,864
[gavel banging]

841
01:07:22,908 --> 01:07:24,257
- He does recall the story

842
01:07:24,301 --> 01:07:25,563
of how the robin
got his red breast.

843
01:07:26,607 --> 01:07:28,566
Namely, that when
Jesus was on the cross,

844
01:07:28,609 --> 01:07:31,525
all the animals in the
world, except the fish,

845
01:07:31,569 --> 01:07:32,570
came there to mourn.

846
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:36,095
One tender-hearted bird tried
to pluck the crown of thorns

847
01:07:36,139 --> 01:07:37,575
and was stabbed in the breast.

848
01:07:38,706 --> 01:07:40,708
And became covered with blood.

849
01:07:40,752 --> 01:07:42,362
The patient is not clear

850
01:07:42,406 --> 01:07:43,885
whether this blood is
from the bird's own heart

851
01:07:43,929 --> 01:07:45,583
or whether it's from
the head of Christ.

852
01:07:46,975 --> 01:07:49,630
The boy acts as if he were
a law unto himself alone.

853
01:07:49,674 --> 01:07:52,720
[soft emotional music]

854
01:07:53,765 --> 01:07:55,506
- During the trial,

855
01:07:55,549 --> 01:07:58,726
on a porch across the street
from the Franks' home,

856
01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:00,119
we found a human head,

857
01:08:01,642 --> 01:08:03,905
two withered human arms,

858
01:08:03,949 --> 01:08:06,604
and a single discolored
leg arranged in the shape

859
01:08:06,647 --> 01:08:08,562
of a pirate's skull
and crossbones.

860
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:14,481
There was an envelope between
the elbows of the two arms,

861
01:08:14,525 --> 01:08:17,136
addressed to Chicago,
City of Crime.

862
01:08:19,443 --> 01:08:20,226
The note said,

863
01:08:21,488 --> 01:08:23,838
"If the court don't
hang them, we will."

864
01:08:23,882 --> 01:08:26,189
It was signed, KKK.

865
01:08:27,755 --> 01:08:29,192
[gavel banging]
- It's too bad

866
01:08:29,235 --> 01:08:30,889
you didn't get to them
before I got them.

867
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,848
Then they wouldn't have
said anything at all.

868
01:08:33,892 --> 01:08:35,850
And this murder
would be unavenged.

869
01:08:35,894 --> 01:08:37,287
- Strike that out.

870
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:38,853
- It's not the
enforcement of law,

871
01:08:38,897 --> 01:08:41,117
to capture people and
compel them to talk.

872
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,640
- We didn't compel them to talk.

873
01:08:42,683 --> 01:08:45,686
- [laughs] No?
- No, they began talking,

874
01:08:45,730 --> 01:08:47,166
we couldn't stop them.

875
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:48,863
- [Clarence] Yeah, well
I know about that, too.

876
01:08:48,907 --> 01:08:50,822
- They wanted to show how
really smart they were

877
01:08:50,865 --> 01:08:52,040
about their perfect crime.

878
01:08:53,694 --> 01:08:55,218
Your Honor, bearing
in mind the testimony

879
01:08:55,261 --> 01:08:56,741
which has been
whispered into your ear

880
01:08:56,784 --> 01:09:00,310
by the defense alienist
concerning fantasies,

881
01:09:00,353 --> 01:09:03,661
I would remind the court that
the basic motive in this case

882
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:09,580
is the desire to
satisfy unnatural lusts.

883
01:09:12,017 --> 01:09:14,715
Your honor, you have before
you the coroner's report,

884
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:17,892
which says that when little
Robert Franks was examined,

885
01:09:19,416 --> 01:09:21,461
his rectum was

01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:29,161
determined to satisfy his lust.

1064
01:22:29,205 --> 01:22:30,946
All he got for his
shower of kisses

1065
01:22:30,989 --> 01:22:32,817
was a shiv between the shoulders

1066
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:35,515
wielded by the powerful
arm of the black man

1067
01:22:35,559 --> 01:22:39,476
who was revolted by the touch
of Loeb's slobbering lips.

1068
01:22:40,651 --> 01:22:43,480
[Nathan wailing]

1069
01:23:40,406 --> 01:23:42,756
After a brief trial and
50 minutes of deliberation

1070
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:46,282
by the jury, James Day
was found not guilty.

1071
01:23:47,370 --> 01:23:52,375
[water sloshing]
[soft orchestral music]

1072
01:25:20,767 --> 01:25:23,422
[Nathan sobbing]

1073
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:34,041
[dramatic banging]

1074
01:25:37,393 --> 01:25:39,743
- [Nathan] March 4th, 1936.

1075
01:25:44,226 --> 01:25:46,750
For six months I was kept
locked up in the St. Marion

1076
01:25:46,793 --> 01:25:48,665
as the murderer of Richard Loeb.

1077
01:25:50,754 --> 01:25:52,799
The following year I
was constantly escorted

1078
01:25:52,843 --> 01:25:53,626
by prison guard.

1079
01:25:55,454 --> 01:25:58,370
[dramatic banging]

1080
01:26:33,753 --> 01:26:36,669
[soft music]
- Now I know you,

1081
01:26:36,713 --> 01:26:39,237
your dog-like nature
that adores being kicked,

1082
01:26:39,281 --> 01:26:42,371
and all the more, the
more it is maltreated.

1083
01:26:42,414 --> 01:26:45,243
Now I know you, and you
shall come to know me.

1084
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:53,904
[knocking on door]

1085
01:26:53,947 --> 01:26:54,774
- It's open.

1086
01:26:58,169 --> 01:26:59,910
- They sent me in here.

1087
01:26:59,953 --> 01:27:02,304
- No, I sent for you.

1088
01:27:11,269 --> 01:27:12,270
Take off your shirt.

1089
01:27:18,798 --> 01:27:21,758
If I fog your x-rays, you'll
get a better work assignment.

1090
01:27:23,325 --> 01:27:24,630
It looks like asthma.

1091
01:27:38,644 --> 01:27:40,255
Step behind this
curtain, please.

1092
01:27:46,609 --> 01:27:47,871
Ladies and gentlemen,

1093
01:27:47,914 --> 01:27:50,482
that is my prepared statement.

1094
01:27:50,526 --> 01:27:52,789
Now bear with me for a moment.

1095
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:55,270
There are one or two
things I would like to say

1096
01:27:55,313 --> 01:27:56,793
off the cuff, as it were.

1097
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:01,624
In my religion, the
Jewish religion,

1098
01:28:01,667 --> 01:28:04,409
we have some very
beautiful prayers.

1099
01:28:05,584 --> 01:28:08,152
One that has always
been my favorite

1100
01:28:08,195 --> 01:28:09,936
is the Kaddish.

1101
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:11,590
It begins [speaking
foreign language],

1102
01:28:16,073 --> 01:28:17,944
which means,

1103
01:28:17,988 --> 01:28:20,382
magnified and

1104
01:28:21,731 --> 01:28:25,778
sanctified, be his great name.

1105
01:28:25,822 --> 01:28:29,521
The very word Kaddish
means sanctification.

1106
01:28:30,566 --> 01:28:32,219
For a good many years,

1107
01:28:32,263 --> 01:28:37,268
I wondered why this
long, lovely prayer,

1108
01:28:38,835 --> 01:28:40,837
which is said at the close
of all Jewish religious...

1109
01:28:43,056 --> 01:28:44,841
- [Man] Nathan Leopold
moved to Puerto Rico

1110
01:28:44,884 --> 01:28:47,713
immediately following
his release from prison.

1111
01:28:47,757 --> 01:28:49,846
He had been in prison
for over 33 years.

1112
01:28:51,195 --> 01:28:52,849
In Puerto Rico, he worked
as an x-ray technician

1113
01:28:52,892 --> 01:28:54,851
and married Gertrude
Feldman Garcia.

1114
01:28:56,069 --> 01:28:58,724
He frequently defied his
parole responsibilities,

1115
01:28:58,768 --> 01:29:01,292
drinking, staying
out past curfew,

1116
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:03,903
communicating with
prisoners and ex-prisoners.

1117
01:29:03,947 --> 01:29:05,992
Frequenting houses
of prostitution.

1118
01:29:06,036 --> 01:29:07,951
Keeping guns for birding.

1119
01:29:07,994 --> 01:29:09,344
Traveling without permission.

1120
01:29:10,997 --> 01:29:14,131
In 1956, Meyer Levin
fictionalized his life

1121
01:29:14,174 --> 01:29:15,828
in the novel "Compulsion."

1122
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,441
A film based on the
novel appeared in 1958.

1123
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:22,966
Nathan Leopold tried
unsuccessfully to
sue Meyer Levin

1124
01:29:23,009 --> 01:29:25,577
for willful misrepresentation
of his character.

1125
01:29:27,144 --> 01:29:29,102
He died on August 30th, 1971,

1126
01:29:29,146 --> 01:29:31,453
in the Memia Hospital
near San Juan.

1127
01:29:32,279 --> 01:29:33,759
He had willed his eyes

1128
01:29:33,803 --> 01:29:35,457
to the University of
Puerto Rico eye bank,

1129
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:36,849
and his body for research.

1130
01:29:37,850 --> 01:29:39,112
Immediately after his death,

1131
01:29:39,156 --> 01:29:40,984
his eyes were
successfully transferred

1132
01:29:41,027 --> 01:29:42,420
to a blind woman.

1133
01:29:42,464 --> 01:29:45,162
