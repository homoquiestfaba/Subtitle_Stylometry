1
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:16,559
Come here, Rocky! Come on, Rocky!
Here he comes!

2
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,063
Rocky!

3
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,734
-Come on!
-Rocky! Come on!

4
00:00:27,978 --> 00:00:30,048
Rocky! Come here, Rocky! Rocky.

5
00:00:31,514 --> 00:00:32,950
Good boy.

6
00:00:33,016 --> 00:00:35,387
Where did this dog come from?

7
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:38,188
Bad dog! Go!

8
00:00:39,855 --> 00:00:41,258
Look out!

9
00:00:43,225 --> 00:00:45,362
No, not again!

10
00:00:46,862 --> 00:00:49,367
l've had enough!

11
00:00:49,432 --> 00:00:51,602
Wait a minute, Mrs. Cooper.

12
00:00:52,935 --> 00:00:54,104
Mrs. Cooper!

13
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,887
-Chalk off another one!
-Nice one!

14
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:14,858
Wait a minute, Mrs. Larson.

15
00:01:14,924 --> 00:01:16,059
Mrs. Larson.

16
00:01:17,693 --> 00:01:20,465
Boys? Boys, come on in now.
It's time for dinner.

17
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:31,375
Mrs. Hampston, please,
at least just stay for the holidays.

18
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,009
l won't stay another minute.

19
00:01:33,075 --> 00:01:36,649
Look, l'm very sorry about the boys.
Okay, but they're only six.

20
00:01:36,712 --> 00:01:38,849
Which is why l don't blame them.

21
00:01:38,914 --> 00:01:40,082
You don't?

22
00:01:40,148 --> 00:01:44,824
They're your children, Mr. Webster,
not your playmates, not your pets.

23
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:49,463
They need a mature, steady hand
to guide them. Your hand. Now, goodbye.

24
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:50,994
Mrs. Hampston.

25
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,700
You don't need a housekeeper.
You need a miracle.

26
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:12,683
-l got both of you!
-Dad.

27
00:02:20,456 --> 00:02:22,793
You got me. You got me. You got me.

28
00:02:22,858 --> 00:02:24,293
Okay.

29
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,363
All right, guys, time for bed.

30
00:02:28,063 --> 00:02:29,098
Okay.

31
00:02:29,165 --> 00:02:31,369
You put up a good fight.

32
00:02:34,803 --> 00:02:36,907
There you go.

33
00:02:36,972 --> 00:02:38,709
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

34
00:02:39,475 --> 00:02:42,346
There you go. Good night, buddy.

35
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,149
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

36
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:47,317
-Dad?
-Yeah?

37
00:02:47,382 --> 00:02:51,457
We're sorry. We were iust trying to have fun
with the housekeeper.

38
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,895
Well, sometimes
things don't always work out.

39
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,828
What are we going to do?

40
00:02:57,893 --> 00:02:59,963
We're never going to find anybody now.

41
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:03,101
What are you talking about?
Everything's under control.

42
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:04,166
Really?

43
00:03:04,232 --> 00:03:06,402
Absolutely.

44
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:09,841
You guys don't have anything
to worry about, all right?

45
00:03:09,905 --> 00:03:12,644
Dad, can l ask you something?

46
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,177
Sure.

47
00:03:14,242 --> 00:03:16,580
Do you know
what Mommy's favorite color was?

48
00:03:19,114 --> 00:03:20,884
You know, it's late.
You guys should go to sleep.

49
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:04,997
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

50
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:14,839
Way To Go Travel. Hello, Mrs. Clark!

51
00:04:15,637 --> 00:04:18,476
Yes, l did a little research,
and it's a great resort,

52
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:22,013
and it includes everything, hotels,
meals, gratuities.

53
00:04:23,578 --> 00:04:26,083
So you step out of your room
right on to the beach,

54
00:04:26,148 --> 00:04:29,854
and you wouldn't believe the sunsets.
Absolutely gorgeous.

55
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:35,193
Well, no, l've never actually been there
myself, but that's what everyone tells me.

56
00:04:35,257 --> 00:04:39,398
And normally, they don't take reservations
after Thanksgiving, but l did...

57
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,632
l noticed a cancellation, and it's still there.

58
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:45,702
Great!

59
00:04:47,535 --> 00:04:49,906
Yeah, maybe l will make it there
one of these days.

60
00:04:49,972 --> 00:04:52,476
Reba. Your mom.

61
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,647
Mrs. Clark? l'm going to call you
with the details later.

62
00:04:56,711 --> 00:04:58,781
Perfect. Okay, bye.

63
00:04:58,846 --> 00:05:01,151
l totally forgot!

64
00:05:01,216 --> 00:05:03,853
-Thanks, Nicki. l'll be back.
-Hurry.

65
00:05:14,696 --> 00:05:17,068
-Mom, l'm sorry.
-Hi, sweetheart.

66
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,306
-l'm sorry.
-No, it's fine. Sit, sit.

67
00:05:21,369 --> 00:05:24,441
What a crazy week. l mean, the phones,
they just... They haven't stopped.

68
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:27,177
Well, that little business of yours
is really booming then.

69
00:05:27,242 --> 00:05:30,781
Happens every year.
People want to get away for the holidays.

70
00:05:30,845 --> 00:05:33,049
l'm iust happy
you finally found something more secure

71
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:35,352
than your so-called theater career.

72
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:38,955
Yeah, you've mentioned
that once or twice before, Mom.

73
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:44,296
Speaking of getting away, l had a call
from your favorite aunt and uncle yesterday.

74
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,931
Aunt Molly and Uncle Bill? How are they?

75
00:05:46,994 --> 00:05:50,033
Well, they're finally taking that Hawaiian
vacation they've always talked about.

76
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:52,470
And they're going to stop here
for a couple of days on the way.

77
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:54,236
That's great! When?

78
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,041
They arrive late on the 23rd from St. Paul,

79
00:05:57,105 --> 00:06:00,110
and they leave for Hawaii
the morning of the 26th.

80
00:06:00,174 --> 00:06:01,510
So they're going to be here for Christmas.

81
00:06:01,576 --> 00:06:05,015
Yes, and honey, they're so excited
to see you and Vicki.

82
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:07,016
-How long has it been?
-Mom.

83
00:06:07,081 --> 00:06:11,890
Look, Reba, it would be so nice for them
if we could have a real family Christmas,

84
00:06:11,953 --> 00:06:13,656
everyone together again.

85
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:16,192
Well, it won't work, so...

86
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:22,199
Look, Reba, it's been four years.

87
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,269
l thought with your aunt and uncle coming,
wouldn't this be the most wonderful time

88
00:06:26,335 --> 00:06:29,374
to iust put everything behind us?
Wouldn't it?

89
00:06:30,438 --> 00:06:32,475
You know what she did.

90
00:06:33,808 --> 00:06:36,747
Vicki's your sister. You have to settle it.

91
00:06:37,345 --> 00:06:39,950
l have settled it.
l want nothing to do with her.

92
00:06:40,014 --> 00:06:41,917
What about your aunt and uncle?

93
00:06:41,983 --> 00:06:45,189
They think the world of you and Vicki.
They want to see both of you.

94
00:06:45,253 --> 00:06:47,458
Okay, well then, we'll do
what we've done for the last four years.

95
00:06:47,522 --> 00:06:50,461
Vicki and her family, they can see you
on Christmas Day or Christmas Eve,

96
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:54,164
and l'll iust visit when they're not there.
Okay?

97
00:06:55,496 --> 00:06:59,069
You know, if your father was alive...

98
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:01,938
Mom, change the subiect.

99
00:07:13,314 --> 00:07:15,952
Mrs. Ackerman,
do you have some good news for us?

100
00:07:16,017 --> 00:07:18,121
Well, we're...Yes.

101
00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:21,860
We're iust very excited
about meeting our new housekeeper.

102
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,161
l realize they don't grow on trees.

103
00:07:25,226 --> 00:07:27,898
l know you're trying your best,
and l really appreciate it,

104
00:07:27,962 --> 00:07:31,401
but iust it's been about a week,
and with the holidays coming...

105
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:33,002
Guys, cool it.

106
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:39,108
Okay, l'll call back again.

107
00:07:42,576 --> 00:07:45,849
Okay, guys. Okay, come on. Hey.
All right, look, let him go.

108
00:07:45,913 --> 00:07:49,252
l know, you got him in a headlock, okay.
Let it go. Time out.

109
00:07:49,317 --> 00:07:52,857
Okay. l got you. Get up. There we go.

110
00:07:54,388 --> 00:07:56,726
Mr. Webster, l'm sure l don't have to tell you

111
00:07:56,791 --> 00:08:00,230
how wonderfully, well,
high-spirited your boys are.

112
00:08:00,294 --> 00:08:05,203
lt really is a treat to have them in my class.
They are both so bright, and funny,

113
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:09,474
and, well, gosh,
l just can't get over all that energy!

114
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,075
So, but we're good?

115
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,348
Sure, yeah, yeah. They're hard-working.
They've made lots of friends.

116
00:08:17,411 --> 00:08:21,853
They have a real flair for music.
Does that run in the family?

117
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,151
No, not really.

118
00:08:23,217 --> 00:08:27,024
No. Well, they're great boys.
You should be very proud.

119
00:08:27,554 --> 00:08:29,724
Thank you. All right.

120
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:33,730
Of course, l'm sure you're also aware that,

121
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:40,707
well, at times, their natural enthusiasm
can be just a tad overwhelming.

122
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:43,405
Yeah.

123
00:08:43,471 --> 00:08:45,976
lt's important that they learn
to channel that energy

124
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,746
into more constructive outlets,
which is why l am so pleased

125
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:52,648
that Judd and Jason want to take part
in this year's Christmas pageant.

126
00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:53,814
Christmas pageant?

127
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,452
Yeah. They're so excited about it,

128
00:08:56,517 --> 00:08:58,621
and l honestly think
it's going to be just the thing for them.

129
00:08:58,685 --> 00:09:01,157
-l mean, don't you?
-Well...

130
00:09:02,523 --> 00:09:07,399
Which reminds me. The first parents'
meeting is in five minutes in the library.

131
00:09:07,461 --> 00:09:09,364
You don't want to be late.

132
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,700
-All right, l should get going then.
-Okay.

133
00:09:11,765 --> 00:09:13,268
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

134
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:15,905
-Very nice to meet you.
-You as well.

135
00:09:26,414 --> 00:09:30,955
For those of you here for the first time,
my name is Milly Waters.

136
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:33,956
This is my fifth year
directing the school pageant.

137
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,195
And l can tell you
we are all very, very excited.

138
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:39,928
Now as some of you know,

139
00:09:39,993 --> 00:09:45,404
we started work on the songs last week
with our musical director, Mrs. Darling.

140
00:09:45,466 --> 00:09:48,103
l will hold auditions
and assign speaking parts

141
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:53,245
by the end of the week. Rehearsal will be
for one hour after school every day.

142
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:56,845
Does anybody have any questions?

143
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,346
-l do.
-Yes.

144
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,683
Cindy! Cindy, thank you very much.

145
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:05,921
And seriously, don't worry about the fire.
This stuff happens all the time.

146
00:10:05,986 --> 00:10:08,458
So we'll call you?

147
00:10:09,256 --> 00:10:10,791
That's okay.

148
00:10:18,198 --> 00:10:19,334
Boys?

149
00:10:27,642 --> 00:10:31,983
My muscles are screaming at me.
l hope you're happy with yourself.

150
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:33,381
Me?

151
00:10:33,447 --> 00:10:36,553
Yeah, the only time l ever get here
is when you call and make me feel guilty,

152
00:10:36,617 --> 00:10:38,854
but you haven't called, have you?

153
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:40,186
Sorry.

154
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:43,592
So what's been keeping you so busy?

155
00:10:43,658 --> 00:10:46,129
Just business.
You know, l can barely keep up right now.

156
00:10:46,192 --> 00:10:47,260
Really?

157
00:10:47,327 --> 00:10:49,465
Yeah, so this guy calls the other day.

158
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,199
lt's almost the middle
of December, right?

159
00:10:51,264 --> 00:10:52,800
And he wants to book a flight to Maui.

160
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:55,838
Go ahead. Tell me all about work.

161
00:10:55,902 --> 00:10:57,170
What?

162
00:10:57,237 --> 00:10:59,809
Reba, l am married with two kids.

163
00:10:59,873 --> 00:11:02,210
l spend all day
in a room full of six year olds

164
00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:05,949
who laugh at anything
that sounds even remotely like poo.

165
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:09,385
l need something to hang onto here.
You're my last hope.

166
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:11,821
Well, sorry to disappoint you.

167
00:11:11,885 --> 00:11:14,322
You're really not seeing anyone at all?

168
00:11:14,387 --> 00:11:16,257
God, you know,
that makes it sound so much better.

169
00:11:16,322 --> 00:11:19,796
Well, it iust doesn't make any sense to me.
l mean, come on, you're smart,

170
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:23,131
and you're gorgeous, and you're talented.

171
00:11:23,196 --> 00:11:26,703
Your Maria in The Sound of Music
made everyone say, ''Julie who?''

172
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:28,168
And now you run your own business.

173
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:31,941
Okay, if you say that l have
a good personality, l'm going to deck you.

174
00:11:32,005 --> 00:11:33,574
Well, you do.

175
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,752
-l'm gonna go get some milk.
-Me, too.

176
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,287
Yes, absolutely.

177
00:11:46,352 --> 00:11:50,093
l could probably get some concepts
drawn up for you by the middle of the week,

178
00:11:50,156 --> 00:11:51,926
but considering the...

179
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:53,761
-Let me pour.
-No, l can do it.

180
00:11:53,827 --> 00:11:55,629
-Let me pour!
-l can do it!

181
00:11:55,696 --> 00:11:58,333
-Guys, guys!
-l can do it!

182
00:12:01,702 --> 00:12:04,874
l'm sorry.
Can you hold on just one second?

183
00:12:04,938 --> 00:12:06,106
All right.

184
00:12:07,974 --> 00:12:10,178
Go to your room.
l'll call you when dinner's ready.

185
00:12:14,881 --> 00:12:16,383
Sorry about that.

186
00:12:18,151 --> 00:12:20,421
Hey, look!

187
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:54,556
Not bad, fellas. Nice size, yeah.

188
00:12:54,621 --> 00:12:58,261
Good and solid, and packed tight,
but not too heavy.

189
00:13:02,796 --> 00:13:04,766
-Missed us! You can't get us!
-Missed us! You can't get us!

190
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,533
-Yeah?
-Missed us!

191
00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:15,410
Don't mess with the big dog.

192
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:20,348
Get the door! Get the door!

193
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:39,333
Mr. Webster?

194
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:42,938
-Yes.
-l'm Emily Merkle. Nice to see you.

195
00:13:43,403 --> 00:13:48,646
How you doing, huh? l like that shirt.
That's a good color for you. Yeah.

196
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:51,712
Wait a minute. You got something there.
What is that?

197
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:53,581
ls that a little gravy?

198
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:54,748
Yeah.

199
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:57,553
-Probably'll come right off with some seltzer.
-Okay.

200
00:13:57,617 --> 00:14:01,758
lt's cold out here. Oh, boy. Yeah.

201
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:08,197
Let me back up here for a minute.
The agency sent me, okay?

202
00:14:08,695 --> 00:14:10,064
-The agency?
-Yeah.

203
00:14:10,128 --> 00:14:13,535
The employment agency?
You know, big building downtown.

204
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,239
Lots of people. Everyone trying to get a iob.
l mean, l'm talking grim.

205
00:14:17,303 --> 00:14:21,277
Okay, great! l'm sorry, you iust...
You weren't what l expected.

206
00:14:21,341 --> 00:14:25,582
Yeah, l get that a lot. But you know what?
You'll get used to it.

207
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:28,584
No, Mrs. Ackerman didn't even tell me
she'd found somebody.

208
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:31,353
Well, it's more fun this way.

209
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:34,823
You see, then l can pop in and go,
''Surprise!''

210
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:39,594
Keep your pants on, honey.
l'm just kidding.

211
00:14:40,593 --> 00:14:43,331
Oh, my goodness! You've been robbed!

212
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:45,065
What?

213
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,869
No, no, this is...

214
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:52,241
No, no, l'm iust kidding again.
It's just a mess, right?

215
00:14:52,304 --> 00:14:53,974
l mean, sometimes l kid,

216
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:57,579
but seriously, this is really a mess.

217
00:14:57,644 --> 00:15:00,449
l was iust talking with the boys
how we needed to keep things...

218
00:15:00,513 --> 00:15:04,386
Hi, fellas! Well, what you two been up to?

219
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,822
Guys, come say hi.
It's all right. This is Mrs...

220
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:09,824
-Merkle.
-Mrs. Merkle.

221
00:15:11,356 --> 00:15:13,059
You're twins, right?

222
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,429
-Yeah.
-We're paternal.

223
00:15:15,495 --> 00:15:17,498
He means fraternal.

224
00:15:17,563 --> 00:15:20,702
Don't say a word. Don't tell me a word.

225
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:25,342
You are Judd and Jason.

226
00:15:25,404 --> 00:15:26,439
How'd you know?

227
00:15:26,505 --> 00:15:29,010
lt's easy. It was written on your foreheads.

228
00:15:32,077 --> 00:15:35,918
Now tell me something. Are you two
responsible for most of this mess?

229
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:40,554
Well, good for you.

230
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,095
Because if you're going to trash this place,
you might as well do it right.

231
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:49,062
What do l smell?

232
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:53,901
Listen, l apologize for the mess. It's not...

233
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:56,304
See, l knew it was gravy,

234
00:15:56,368 --> 00:15:59,842
but seriously, is somebody boiling lard?

235
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,077
We're cooking dinner.

236
00:16:03,141 --> 00:16:07,282
Shoot. What am l going to do
about this dinner l have here?

237
00:16:07,346 --> 00:16:08,548
You have dinner?

238
00:16:08,613 --> 00:16:11,318
That smells good.

239
00:16:11,383 --> 00:16:15,390
lt's a very special recipe.
l wouldn't want to twist your arm.

240
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:16,589
Really good.

241
00:16:16,655 --> 00:16:21,398
Now you're sure?
Okay, Mr. Webster, you're out of here.

242
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,399
Go, l don't know, read a newspaper,
or call EPA,

243
00:16:24,463 --> 00:16:26,600
or whatever it is you normally do
as an architect.

244
00:16:26,665 --> 00:16:30,874
Meanwhile, l'm going to clean up
this place in a jiffy. Come on, boys, help me.

245
00:16:30,937 --> 00:16:32,172
Come on.

246
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:34,975
Okay.

247
00:16:37,175 --> 00:16:40,481
Boys, wait a minute.
l've got to ask you something.

248
00:16:40,545 --> 00:16:44,352
Now are there any marbles in the house?

249
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,518
Yeah.

250
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:48,891
Okay. Now you go find them,
and bring them to me,

251
00:16:48,955 --> 00:16:53,029
and bring me all the Play-Doh you can,
and some liquid soap,

252
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:56,197
and a box of baking soda, okay?

253
00:16:56,261 --> 00:17:00,102
-But why do you need those...
-No, no. No questions, understand?

254
00:17:03,335 --> 00:17:05,172
Okay, go get them.

255
00:17:09,107 --> 00:17:12,413
Well, that ought to keep them busy
for a while.

256
00:17:18,316 --> 00:17:21,088
You ain't seen nothing yet, honey.

257
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:28,962
This is so cool, Dad.

258
00:17:30,362 --> 00:17:32,332
l'll say.

259
00:17:32,397 --> 00:17:34,667
What do they call this dessert?

260
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:36,035
Angel food cake.

261
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:37,803
Angels eat cake?

262
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:39,672
When it tastes like this, they do.

263
00:17:39,738 --> 00:17:42,810
Well, l'll take that as a compliment.

264
00:17:42,874 --> 00:17:46,982
Here's a question for you.
Who can clear off this table the fastest?

265
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:49,116
Okay, l'll begin a count.

266
00:17:49,181 --> 00:17:55,493
One, two, three, four, five.

267
00:17:55,554 --> 00:17:59,628
l'll get it, honey. Thanks.
That's a good job. Thank you.

268
00:18:01,226 --> 00:18:02,861
Nicely done.

269
00:18:04,463 --> 00:18:07,602
What, did you buy a ticket to this show?

270
00:18:16,241 --> 00:18:17,576
Thanks.

271
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:28,722
-Good night, Dad! Good night!
-Good night, Dad! Good night!

272
00:18:28,787 --> 00:18:30,590
Good night, guys!

273
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:34,329
-You guys all set?
-Did you see how we cleaned up?

274
00:18:34,392 --> 00:18:35,994
Yeah, you did a great iob.

275
00:18:36,061 --> 00:18:39,066
But then Mrs. Miracle made us take a bath.

276
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:40,534
Mrs. Merkle, you mean.

277
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:43,170
That's what he said, Mrs. Miracle.

278
00:18:43,234 --> 00:18:44,570
And you know what else?

279
00:18:44,636 --> 00:18:48,242
Mrs. Miracle said we have to brush our teeth
before she'll read to us.

280
00:18:48,305 --> 00:18:49,808
Well, that sounds about right to me.

281
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,645
-But, Dad!
-But, Dad!

282
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:56,553
But what? No buts, all right?
You guys listen to Mrs. Merkle. Okay?

283
00:18:56,615 --> 00:19:00,355
-Okay, you two, come on. Scoot, scoot.
-All right, time for bed.

284
00:19:00,418 --> 00:19:02,522
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

285
00:19:03,722 --> 00:19:05,291
-Love you, buddy.
-Love you, too.

286
00:19:05,356 --> 00:19:06,559
Okay.

287
00:19:10,662 --> 00:19:11,797
Man.

288
00:19:12,296 --> 00:19:15,402
You know,
l hardly ever read to them anymore.

289
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:17,036
And when l do, l fall asleep.

290
00:19:17,102 --> 00:19:20,408
Come on, don't be hard on yourself.
You've had your hands full.

291
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:23,909
Yeah, l guess.

292
00:19:23,975 --> 00:19:28,283
You know what you might need?
A little time for yourself.

293
00:19:28,345 --> 00:19:32,119
What is that? l don't even think about that.

294
00:19:32,184 --> 00:19:34,154
Of course you don't.

295
00:19:34,953 --> 00:19:38,159
You know, l'm sorry.
l didn't even show you to your room.

296
00:19:38,222 --> 00:19:40,627
No, it's all right. The boys settled me in.

297
00:19:40,692 --> 00:19:41,827
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

298
00:19:41,893 --> 00:19:43,763
Okay. Well, then,
l guess we should probably talk

299
00:19:43,828 --> 00:19:47,334
about references, and schedules,
and all that stuff.

300
00:19:47,398 --> 00:19:50,504
Mrs. Miracle! Come on! We're waiting!

301
00:19:50,568 --> 00:19:52,171
My audience awaits.

302
00:19:52,804 --> 00:19:54,573
l guess we can talk
about it another time then.

303
00:19:54,639 --> 00:19:57,845
Okay. Here l come!

304
00:20:00,311 --> 00:20:03,685
Mrs. Miracle!
You're supposed to sit over here.

305
00:20:03,748 --> 00:20:08,056
-You sit here next to me!
-No! l called dibs first!

306
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:11,558
-She should sit over here on my bed!
-Okay, then l get to pick the story.

307
00:20:11,622 --> 00:20:14,394
Settle down, boys.
We'll find one you both like.

308
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:15,961
Mrs. Miracle.

309
00:20:35,746 --> 00:20:37,216
Actually, well, we are on schedule.

310
00:20:37,281 --> 00:20:39,986
There is a new schedule that came out after
with the revised plans

311
00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:43,757
that accounted for the new additions
that you requested.

312
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:31,972
Hi. Yeah, this is Seth Webster
calling for Mrs. Ackerman again.

313
00:21:32,037 --> 00:21:34,174
She's not in.
Okay, do you know when she'll be back?

314
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:36,509
Boys, come on.

315
00:21:36,573 --> 00:21:38,043
Hold my hand.

316
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:43,285
No, it's not urgent. l iust wanted to check in
with her about our new housekeeper.

317
00:21:43,347 --> 00:21:45,117
Okay, thanks.

318
00:22:07,037 --> 00:22:11,145
That was wonderful, children!

319
00:22:11,209 --> 00:22:13,078
Now as you know,

320
00:22:13,143 --> 00:22:19,121
today we have auditions
for the speaking parts in this year's pageant.

321
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:22,389
We have a number of roles to fill.

322
00:22:22,453 --> 00:22:28,898
There are shepherds, and reindeer,
and angels, so don't worry.

323
00:22:28,959 --> 00:22:32,333
You'll each have your moment
in the spotlight.

324
00:22:32,796 --> 00:22:36,303
And remember,
when it's your turn to audition,

325
00:22:36,368 --> 00:22:39,974
l want you to give it everything you've got.

326
00:22:40,037 --> 00:22:42,909
Let them hear you in the back row,

327
00:22:42,973 --> 00:22:46,814
and remember, say it with feeling!

328
00:22:46,877 --> 00:22:50,451
Really put your heart into it!

329
00:22:50,514 --> 00:22:54,855
And the angel said unto him, ''Fear not!

330
00:22:54,918 --> 00:23:00,696
''For behold,
l bring you good tidings of great joy!''

331
00:23:13,771 --> 00:23:15,508
ls she okay?

332
00:23:16,273 --> 00:23:19,345
-She looks okay.
-She's breathing.

333
00:23:20,978 --> 00:23:23,082
Help! Help! She's fallen!

334
00:23:25,716 --> 00:23:27,553
l think she's moving.

335
00:23:41,832 --> 00:23:43,401
-You've got to be kidding me.
-No, l'm serious.

336
00:23:43,466 --> 00:23:46,138
The school needs someone to come in
and take over the pageant right now.

337
00:23:46,203 --> 00:23:47,873
So naturally you thought of me?

338
00:23:47,938 --> 00:23:51,044
Well, who else? l mean, you've been
doing theater since we were kids,

339
00:23:51,108 --> 00:23:52,243
acting and directing, and...

340
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:54,446
Come on. You've done more plays
than anyone else l know.

341
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,779
Kate, that was a long time ago.

342
00:23:55,846 --> 00:23:59,954
Yeah, but you still love it. Come on, fess up.
You miss it sometimes.

343
00:24:00,384 --> 00:24:03,691
That's not the point.
l run a travel agency now.

344
00:24:03,754 --> 00:24:05,991
Well, you have a great staff here,

345
00:24:06,056 --> 00:24:08,260
and they're going to keep things humming
while you're in rehearsals.

346
00:24:08,325 --> 00:24:10,062
There's not going to be any rehearsals.

347
00:24:10,127 --> 00:24:14,001
Come on, Reba. Those kids,
they could learn so much from you.

348
00:24:14,064 --> 00:24:15,967
You can pass on
some of that special stage magic.

349
00:24:16,033 --> 00:24:18,036
-Please.
-Come on.

350
00:24:18,101 --> 00:24:20,171
The parents are taking care
of all the costumes and sets.

351
00:24:20,237 --> 00:24:22,407
Mrs. Darling already has them learning
all the music.

352
00:24:22,473 --> 00:24:27,082
You really iust have to come in
and direct traffic a little, and besides...

353
00:24:29,746 --> 00:24:31,115
Besides?

354
00:24:31,181 --> 00:24:34,120
Well, Christmas hasn't exactly
been easy for you the last few years,

355
00:24:34,184 --> 00:24:37,723
and l thought that with the pageant,
and the kids, and everything...

356
00:24:37,788 --> 00:24:39,624
l would look a little less pathetic?

357
00:24:39,689 --> 00:24:43,496
No. No, you could get back
some of what you've been missing.

358
00:24:46,796 --> 00:24:50,503
Look, there is a part of me that thinks
that this might be fun, but l'm...

359
00:24:50,566 --> 00:24:53,705
Okay.
Well, you don't have to decide right now.

360
00:24:53,769 --> 00:24:55,907
You iust think about it,
and you come and see me after school.

361
00:24:55,973 --> 00:24:59,045
-Kate.
-Please? Please, Reba, please?

362
00:24:59,109 --> 00:25:01,079
Just say you'll think about it.

363
00:25:01,144 --> 00:25:03,815
Fine, l will think about it.

364
00:25:04,915 --> 00:25:07,052
Thank you. Thank you.

365
00:25:15,658 --> 00:25:16,659
Thank you!

366
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:26,738
Okay.

367
00:25:26,802 --> 00:25:28,172
Excuse me.

368
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,912
Hi.

369
00:25:45,988 --> 00:25:47,424
-Hello.
-Hi.

370
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:03,240
Wow.

371
00:26:11,348 --> 00:26:14,487
Don't you wish you could iust hug them?

372
00:26:14,551 --> 00:26:15,686
Sure.

373
00:26:16,652 --> 00:26:19,089
They're a little shorthanded today,
aren't they?

374
00:26:19,155 --> 00:26:20,591
l'd say.

375
00:26:22,992 --> 00:26:25,697
You know, it's all in the timing, honey.

376
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,632
What is?

377
00:26:27,697 --> 00:26:30,302
Finding someone to help.

378
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:34,040
Someone who's ready
to take the leap of faith.

379
00:26:34,103 --> 00:26:36,942
Dust themselves off
and get back in the game.

380
00:26:38,741 --> 00:26:40,076
l suppose.

381
00:26:42,579 --> 00:26:43,814
Where is it?

382
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:47,751
There it is. Okay.

383
00:26:55,191 --> 00:26:58,765
l can get it. l can get it. l can get it. It's okay!

384
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:06,738
l got it! Coming through, coming through.

385
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,075
Gotcha!

386
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,449
Hi.

387
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:20,818
She's pretty.

388
00:27:20,883 --> 00:27:25,459
Don't mind me.
Just keep playing and having fun.

389
00:27:30,326 --> 00:27:31,529
Okay.

390
00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:41,706
Something smells good.

391
00:27:42,872 --> 00:27:44,842
Hey, guys.

392
00:27:46,576 --> 00:27:48,245
Dad, look!

393
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:52,083
-Where did you get that?
-Mrs. Miracle found it.

394
00:27:52,148 --> 00:27:54,485
l didn't even remember
what Mommy looked like.

395
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,920
Me neither!

396
00:27:57,688 --> 00:27:59,223
All right, you guys go to your room,

397
00:27:59,288 --> 00:28:01,793
-and l'll be right in, okay?
-Okay.

398
00:28:07,963 --> 00:28:10,567
Soup's on in five minutes.

399
00:28:10,634 --> 00:28:12,904
Where did you get this?

400
00:28:12,968 --> 00:28:15,405
The boys were so full of questions
about their mother.

401
00:28:15,471 --> 00:28:16,472
Where did you get it?

402
00:28:16,539 --> 00:28:19,044
l found it in the bookcase this morning
when l was dusting.

403
00:28:19,108 --> 00:28:21,713
-ln the bookcase?
-Yeah, between two books

404
00:28:21,777 --> 00:28:26,552
like it had been there a long time.
It's a silly place to keep a picture.

405
00:28:27,283 --> 00:28:31,157
-Mrs. Merkle, l would appreciate it if...
-What was her name?

406
00:28:31,887 --> 00:28:33,322
Pamela.

407
00:28:35,391 --> 00:28:37,896
Her name was Pamela.

408
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,564
She looked like such a sweetie.

409
00:28:40,629 --> 00:28:44,069
And those eyes.
Please, are you kidding me?

410
00:28:45,334 --> 00:28:47,037
l didn't know it was your wife,

411
00:28:47,103 --> 00:28:50,242
except that she had these two darling boys
in her arms.

412
00:28:50,306 --> 00:28:53,145
So obviously, who else could it be?

413
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:56,515
Now l know
where they get their good looks from, too.

414
00:28:56,579 --> 00:29:00,420
Look, things have been going very well
up until now.

415
00:29:00,483 --> 00:29:03,689
l mean, the boys are happy. l don't know
what l would have done without you.

416
00:29:03,753 --> 00:29:04,889
Well, you're welcome.

417
00:29:04,954 --> 00:29:07,425
But there are certain subiects

418
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:10,162
l would appreciate
you not discussing with the boys.

419
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:11,494
Certain subiects?

420
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,797
Like their mother.

421
00:29:13,862 --> 00:29:15,832
You don't want them to know
about their mother?

422
00:29:15,898 --> 00:29:18,702
That's not...
Of course l want them to know about her.

423
00:29:18,768 --> 00:29:21,507
Good, 'cause for a minute there,
l thought you were going to...

424
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,674
When the time is right.

425
00:29:25,141 --> 00:29:26,243
When they're ready.

426
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:28,345
When they're ready?

427
00:29:29,445 --> 00:29:32,083
Just, please.

428
00:29:33,315 --> 00:29:35,252
Remember from now on.

429
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,894
ls Mrs. Miracle going away?

430
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:47,765
Her name is Mrs. Merkle, okay.
Not Mrs. Miracle. Mrs. Merkle.

431
00:29:53,369 --> 00:29:57,910
And how many times have l told you boys
not to play with that piano, huh?

432
00:31:56,424 --> 00:31:58,227
Hey, Kate, it's Reba.

433
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:01,864
Look, l was iust wondering.

434
00:32:01,931 --> 00:32:04,903
Have you found anyone
to direct the pageant?

435
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,773
Change of heart.

436
00:32:23,017 --> 00:32:25,588
But using recycled materials
would not only cut costs,

437
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:27,791
state tax credits
apply for the next three years.

438
00:32:27,856 --> 00:32:30,293
That makes a big difference
to your bottom line, not to mention,

439
00:32:30,358 --> 00:32:33,063
of course, doing our part
for the environment.

440
00:32:33,127 --> 00:32:35,631
-Hold on one second.
-No problem.

441
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:38,501
Mrs. Merkle, is everything okay?

442
00:32:38,566 --> 00:32:43,575
l'm sorry to bother you at work, but
the man hasn't finished with the dryer yet.

443
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:44,741
Okay.

444
00:32:44,807 --> 00:32:48,713
Well, l have to be here,
and it's almost time to pick up the boys.

445
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:53,083
l'll tell you what, l'm pretty much done here.
Why don't l just pick them up?

446
00:32:53,147 --> 00:32:55,718
Why didn't l think of that?

447
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:59,724
Listen, they are rehearsing for the pageant,
so pick them up at the auditorium.

448
00:32:59,787 --> 00:33:01,390
Auditorium, got it. No problem.

449
00:33:01,456 --> 00:33:03,760
Okay, thanks.

450
00:33:03,826 --> 00:33:05,395
Mrs. Merkle!

451
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:10,699
Good as new.

452
00:33:10,765 --> 00:33:13,570
Sometimes you iust have to give
these things a little push.

453
00:33:13,634 --> 00:33:15,371
Tell me about it.

454
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:21,280
Okay, the snowmen are dressed.
And skippers, we're skipping!

455
00:33:21,342 --> 00:33:23,646
lt's cold outside. It's Christmas!

456
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:26,918
Wanna smile big to all of your family!

457
00:33:26,982 --> 00:33:31,190
You don't want to miss your mom
and your grandmother way out there.

458
00:33:31,252 --> 00:33:35,026
And grab your snowman, and skipping!
Smile really...

459
00:33:40,194 --> 00:33:41,429
Hey, Dad!

460
00:33:49,937 --> 00:33:51,774
Nice work, everyone.

461
00:34:01,215 --> 00:34:03,986
-Are you okay?
-l'm okay. All good.

462
00:34:05,353 --> 00:34:07,423
Okay, that's enough, everyone.

463
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:10,427
Let's give him
a big round of applause. Okay?

464
00:34:12,894 --> 00:34:17,637
And let's go from the top, okay?
That was really good. Nice work.

465
00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:27,108
That looks good.

466
00:34:28,009 --> 00:34:30,481
Then she said we could sing another song
at the end

467
00:34:30,545 --> 00:34:32,849
and let the audience sing along
if they wanted, too.

468
00:34:32,914 --> 00:34:34,016
Yeah?

469
00:34:34,082 --> 00:34:37,389
A sing-along.
Something easy, though, like Jingle Bells.

470
00:34:37,452 --> 00:34:39,756
-Or frosty the Snowman.
-That's a good idea.

471
00:34:39,821 --> 00:34:44,530
Wow. That sounds like they've got a ringer.
What did you say her name was?

472
00:34:44,592 --> 00:34:47,497
-Miss Maxwell.
-She's nice.

473
00:34:47,562 --> 00:34:50,701
-And funny.
-And pretty.

474
00:34:50,765 --> 00:34:53,437
Didn't you think she was pretty, Dad?

475
00:34:53,501 --> 00:34:56,072
Yeah. Sure, l guess.

476
00:34:56,136 --> 00:35:00,043
-What, are you blind all of a sudden?
-No, but l wasn't there to...

477
00:35:00,108 --> 00:35:03,782
-Did you at least introduce yourself to her?
-No, l didn't want to interrupt.

478
00:35:05,379 --> 00:35:08,985
You're their father. You iust come up,
you shake her hand,

479
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:12,189
you say, ''Nice to meet you,''
and, ''How you doing?''

480
00:35:12,252 --> 00:35:14,824
And l mean, people like that.

481
00:35:14,889 --> 00:35:18,161
That separates us
from the animals, you know?

482
00:35:18,225 --> 00:35:20,329
l got distracted.

483
00:35:20,394 --> 00:35:22,296
He banged his leg.

484
00:35:22,362 --> 00:35:23,898
You banged your leg?

485
00:35:23,965 --> 00:35:25,300
Hey, it hurt.

486
00:35:25,365 --> 00:35:29,306
-You should watch where you're going.
-You guys think that's funny, huh?

487
00:35:30,403 --> 00:35:33,810
You think it's funny l banged my leg?
You little jokesters.

488
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:37,716
You a couple of wise guys, huh?
You think that's funny, huh?

489
00:35:39,814 --> 00:35:43,555
Maxwell, huh?
l wonder if that's Reba Maxwell.

490
00:35:43,618 --> 00:35:44,653
You know her?

491
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:48,125
Well, l overheard someone talking at school
about their vacation.

492
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:53,599
And they said that Reba Maxwell had a
travel agency right next to the grocery store.

493
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:55,897
Really?

494
00:35:55,963 --> 00:35:58,467
Well, maybe it's iust coincidental.

495
00:36:00,233 --> 00:36:03,005
So l hear you have them
eating out of your hand.

496
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:06,342
Well, we have a long way to go still.
l mean, we haven't even started on the sets,

497
00:36:06,406 --> 00:36:08,878
not to mention the costumes, the lighting.

498
00:36:08,943 --> 00:36:10,680
Well, you know what?
You got the kids excited,

499
00:36:10,745 --> 00:36:15,153
and that's half the battle. Trust me.
The parents will show up in no time.

500
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:16,952
You know, one already did.

501
00:36:17,018 --> 00:36:18,654
You're kidding. Who?

502
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,858
l didn't actually meet him,
but he came to pick up his sons,

503
00:36:21,923 --> 00:36:24,460
-Judd and Jason.
-The twins.

504
00:36:24,524 --> 00:36:28,198
Yeah, they're in my class. His name's Seth.
Single parent.

505
00:36:28,261 --> 00:36:29,964
He lost his wife a few years ago.

506
00:36:30,031 --> 00:36:31,701
What happened?

507
00:36:31,766 --> 00:36:35,172
l don't know. The boys don't talk about her.

508
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:37,138
God, that must be hard.

509
00:36:37,205 --> 00:36:39,008
Yeah.

510
00:36:39,073 --> 00:36:41,978
Yeah, well, he's got
the whole frazzled thing down.

511
00:36:42,043 --> 00:36:45,082
He's a nice guy. Cute, too.

512
00:36:46,646 --> 00:36:47,982
l hadn't noticed.

513
00:37:25,485 --> 00:37:27,455
-l'm sorry.
-lt's okay.

514
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,925
-l'm so sorry. It's my fault.
-That's okay.

515
00:37:29,991 --> 00:37:32,428
-Are you all right?
-That's...Yeah.

516
00:37:34,195 --> 00:37:35,830
-Hi.
-Hi.

517
00:37:35,895 --> 00:37:40,471
-Miss Maxwell, we didn't actually...
-No, we didn't. It's Mr. Webster?

518
00:37:40,533 --> 00:37:43,038
-Seth.
-Reba.

519
00:37:43,104 --> 00:37:47,879
Nice to meet you. Here you go.
Sorry about that. l wanted to see you and...

520
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:49,411
You did?

521
00:37:50,343 --> 00:37:52,847
About a vacation, you know, with the boys.

522
00:37:52,912 --> 00:37:54,382
Sure. Sure.

523
00:37:55,548 --> 00:37:58,854
So is now a good time?

524
00:37:58,918 --> 00:38:00,488
Yep, that's what we do.

525
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,359
Thank you.

526
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:12,072
There's always Florida,
which is on the southern part of the south.

527
00:38:14,534 --> 00:38:16,971
-You know, theme parks, Everglades.
-And the weather.

528
00:38:17,037 --> 00:38:20,076
They've got alligators, and hurricanes, and...

529
00:38:20,141 --> 00:38:22,178
No, you know, you're right.

530
00:38:22,243 --> 00:38:24,814
There is a lot of weather
in that part of the country.

531
00:38:24,878 --> 00:38:28,318
You know what? l think it's perfect.

532
00:38:30,884 --> 00:38:32,554
Okay.

533
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:36,660
You know what, maybe you and l can even
go to dinner sometime.

534
00:38:41,094 --> 00:38:42,397
Okay.

535
00:38:49,337 --> 00:38:51,039
Mrs. Merkle?

536
00:38:51,971 --> 00:38:56,145
l kind of made some plans on Friday night.
l hope that's okay.

537
00:38:57,711 --> 00:38:59,648
You and Miss Maxwell have fun.

538
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:05,222
Wait a minute. l never said anything
about going out with Reba.

539
00:39:05,286 --> 00:39:08,290
Well, didn't you visit her
at her travel agency?

540
00:39:08,356 --> 00:39:10,727
Yeah, but l didn't tell you that.

541
00:39:13,693 --> 00:39:18,969
l'm bringing you travel agency brochures
that you left in the living room.

542
00:39:22,769 --> 00:39:27,310
They've got a new Greek restaurant
downtown. You ought to give it a try.

543
00:39:38,985 --> 00:39:40,287
Okay.

544
00:39:57,237 --> 00:39:58,305
That's kind of cute.

545
00:40:08,348 --> 00:40:10,753
What are you laughing at?

546
00:40:28,001 --> 00:40:29,103
Okay.

547
00:40:38,945 --> 00:40:40,982
l probably should have asked.
Do you even like Greek food?

548
00:40:41,047 --> 00:40:43,451
Oh, yeah. It's my favorite.

549
00:40:47,553 --> 00:40:48,989
Thank you.

550
00:40:50,223 --> 00:40:53,095
-l'm a sucker for anything with tzatziki.
-Yeah, me too.

551
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,998
And the weird thing is,
l haven't had it in a few months,

552
00:40:56,062 --> 00:40:57,564
so this is perfect.

553
00:40:57,629 --> 00:41:02,572
l didn't even know this place was here.
My housekeeper recommended it, actually.

554
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:11,347
All l can say is,
it is quite a job you've taken on.

555
00:41:11,411 --> 00:41:14,316
l hope you're getting combat pay.

556
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,150
No, it's not that bad.

557
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:21,824
l mean, l used to love doing theater,
so this is a nice chance to enjoy it again.

558
00:41:21,888 --> 00:41:24,125
You were an actress?

559
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:28,398
Mainly. A little directing,
a lot of waitressing,

560
00:41:28,461 --> 00:41:32,168
a little starving,
and then back to the real world.

561
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:36,604
Well, these kids are very lucky to have you.

562
00:41:38,505 --> 00:41:42,646
l'm the lucky one. Getting to know them,
it's been the best part.

563
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:46,682
My guys are having a great time.
They can't stop talking about you.

564
00:41:46,745 --> 00:41:49,083
l'm beginning to see why.

565
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:54,790
Well, they're wonderful boys.
l mean, they're funny, and they're smart,

566
00:41:54,853 --> 00:41:57,024
and they're so well-behaved.

567
00:41:58,157 --> 00:41:59,726
We're talking
about Judd and Jason Webster?

568
00:41:59,791 --> 00:42:02,029
About this tall, dark hair, twins?

569
00:42:02,095 --> 00:42:04,098
Well-behaved?

570
00:42:05,164 --> 00:42:08,136
You know, you don't have to lie to me
just because we're...

571
00:42:08,201 --> 00:42:11,407
Honestly, l wish
the other kids behaved like them.

572
00:42:11,471 --> 00:42:14,076
Okay, now you're iust talking crazy.

573
00:42:15,641 --> 00:42:18,179
They're really great. l mean it.

574
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:24,953
l do work with a lot of restoration groups
here in the city and in the region.

575
00:42:25,017 --> 00:42:27,489
So you save old buildings?

576
00:42:27,554 --> 00:42:32,095
Well, l like to think of it as kind of giving
an old space a new purpose.

577
00:42:34,193 --> 00:42:37,899
That must be hard, you know, iust seeing
something in a completely different way.

578
00:42:37,963 --> 00:42:41,437
But it's so worth it. It's so worth it. l love it.

579
00:42:41,501 --> 00:42:45,609
Like, for instance, there was
this old movie theater with amazing details.

580
00:42:45,671 --> 00:42:50,514
Rundown, but they wanted to iust level it.
Start from scratch.

581
00:42:50,577 --> 00:42:53,181
We were able to show them
how they could actually make more money

582
00:42:53,246 --> 00:42:55,516
by renovating it into a restaurant
and art gallery.

583
00:42:55,582 --> 00:42:58,421
Okay, wait, not the old Rialto on 30th?

584
00:42:58,484 --> 00:43:00,621
-Yeah, you know it?
-Really?

585
00:43:00,686 --> 00:43:03,291
l went there all the time with my family.

586
00:43:03,356 --> 00:43:04,991
-Yeah.
-l did, too.

587
00:43:05,057 --> 00:43:06,225
-Really?
-Yeah.

588
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,594
And then when l was in college,

589
00:43:07,659 --> 00:43:10,631
they would play these really great
silent films on the weekends,

590
00:43:10,696 --> 00:43:13,401
and there was this guy
that would play the piano

591
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:16,137
kind of like a soundtrack.

592
00:43:16,201 --> 00:43:17,571
Yeah.

593
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,539
That was me.

594
00:43:19,606 --> 00:43:22,945
-Shut up.
-That's how l paid my way through college.

595
00:43:24,876 --> 00:43:27,448
Okay, this is spooky.

596
00:43:27,513 --> 00:43:30,518
You think maybe we saw each other there?

597
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,456
Wow, so you play the piano, too?

598
00:43:35,787 --> 00:43:38,224
-Not anymore.
-Why'd you stop?

599
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:44,499
lt's freezing out here.
We should get you in the car.

600
00:43:44,564 --> 00:43:45,699
Sure.

601
00:43:50,536 --> 00:43:52,005
Thank you.

602
00:44:01,947 --> 00:44:05,621
-Thank you. This was fun.
-Thank you. Dinner was great.

603
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,888
-Yeah, l'll say.
-Wonderful.

604
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,458
So.

605
00:44:17,095 --> 00:44:19,834
-So.
-So, yeah.

606
00:44:21,733 --> 00:44:23,837
-Good night.
-Good night.

607
00:44:33,078 --> 00:44:35,716
You know what? l'm sorry.

608
00:44:35,781 --> 00:44:38,352
When you asked earlier
why l'd stopped playing the piano,

609
00:44:38,417 --> 00:44:40,755
l didn't say anything, and...

610
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,892
The reason l didn't, honestly,
is because this has been a fantastic evening.

611
00:44:44,956 --> 00:44:47,126
l didn't want to ruin it.

612
00:44:47,192 --> 00:44:49,629
What do you mean?

613
00:44:49,696 --> 00:44:52,567
l stopped playing piano
the day my wife died.

614
00:44:53,999 --> 00:44:56,103
Pamela loved music.

615
00:44:58,036 --> 00:45:01,609
Sometimes she would iust lie there
and listen to me play.

616
00:45:02,874 --> 00:45:05,578
After she was gone,
l just didn't see the point.

617
00:45:05,644 --> 00:45:10,487
Yeah, that was a part of your memory of her.
It's something that you shared together.

618
00:45:10,549 --> 00:45:16,027
And everything that l loved about it then
just makes it all the more painful now.

619
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,891
Everybody tells me l should play again,
but...

620
00:45:17,956 --> 00:45:20,627
But they don't understand.

621
00:45:20,692 --> 00:45:25,001
And some things you can't explain,
so l just stopped trying.

622
00:45:25,063 --> 00:45:26,765
Until tonight.

623
00:45:29,834 --> 00:45:31,939
l'm glad you told me.

624
00:45:51,822 --> 00:45:54,727
Maybe we can do this again sometime.

625
00:45:54,792 --> 00:45:56,061
Maybe.

626
00:45:57,763 --> 00:46:00,068
-l'll call you?
-You better.

627
00:46:02,967 --> 00:46:04,403
Good night.

628
00:46:06,338 --> 00:46:09,143
What you said tonight about the twins.

629
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,910
Did you really mean that?

630
00:46:11,976 --> 00:46:13,646
Yes, l really meant it.

631
00:46:15,012 --> 00:46:17,984
Although, l don't know
where they get it from.

632
00:46:18,883 --> 00:46:20,620
-Good night.
-Night.

633
00:46:36,468 --> 00:46:38,171
Watch yourself.

634
00:46:43,341 --> 00:46:45,511
-Mr. Webster.
-Looking good.

635
00:46:46,645 --> 00:46:48,215
-Hello?
-Mr. Webster, hello.

636
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,651
This is Mrs. Ackerman
at the employment agency.

637
00:46:50,715 --> 00:46:52,718
Mrs. Ackerman, hello.

638
00:46:52,784 --> 00:46:55,289
Sorry l haven't gotten back to you.
We've been so busy.

639
00:46:55,353 --> 00:46:57,990
No worries. l probably should have
called you before now anyway.

640
00:46:58,055 --> 00:46:59,558
lt's iust been a little crazy around here.

641
00:46:59,624 --> 00:47:01,894
l only wish l had better news.

642
00:47:02,594 --> 00:47:03,629
l'm sorry?

643
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:05,465
The truth is, l've run out oF ideas.

644
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:08,435
A full-time housekeeper willing to live in
and care for two small children?

645
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,971
l'm afraid l can't help you.

646
00:47:11,035 --> 00:47:13,840
-Well, what about Mrs. Merkle?
-Who?

647
00:47:13,904 --> 00:47:15,807
Emily Merkle, didn't you send her?

648
00:47:15,873 --> 00:47:19,947
Mr. Webster, we don't have anyone
by that name working for us.

649
00:47:23,615 --> 00:47:25,852
l'm sure we talked about this.

650
00:47:26,884 --> 00:47:28,520
Well, l think l would've remembered.

651
00:47:28,587 --> 00:47:32,795
Well, the Ackerman Employment Agency
ran out of candidates,

652
00:47:32,858 --> 00:47:37,266
and they called around, and called someone
at the company that l work for.

653
00:47:37,328 --> 00:47:39,131
The Paradise Valley Employment Services?

654
00:47:39,196 --> 00:47:42,035
Yes. And l mean,
they're the ones who sent me here,

655
00:47:42,099 --> 00:47:44,771
and they have my records
and all the paperwork.

656
00:47:44,836 --> 00:47:48,643
l am so sorry about this misunderstanding.

657
00:47:52,276 --> 00:47:54,380
Well, l've never read better references.

658
00:47:54,446 --> 00:47:56,917
But l do intend on calling
every single one of these people myself.

659
00:47:56,981 --> 00:47:57,982
Of course!

660
00:47:58,783 --> 00:47:59,885
Okay.

661
00:48:00,918 --> 00:48:02,488
The cookies are ready!

662
00:48:03,555 --> 00:48:05,357
Okay, well there's...

663
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:13,868
Don't you iust love how cookies
make everything smell like Christmas?

664
00:48:19,937 --> 00:48:21,874
And Mrs. Darling.

665
00:48:24,508 --> 00:48:26,245
Okay, Delilah.

666
00:48:29,681 --> 00:48:31,383
Little bit louder.

667
00:48:32,516 --> 00:48:36,223
lt's okay. It's okay.
Don't be nervous. Don't be nervous.

668
00:48:41,458 --> 00:48:43,863
Everybody sing along with her.

669
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,539
You are so much better than l am.
That's for sure.

670
00:48:53,637 --> 00:48:57,177
Can you do that again,
and can you do it really loud?

671
00:48:57,241 --> 00:48:58,944
You want to try it?

672
00:48:59,009 --> 00:49:03,217
Do you guys think that she should do it?
Give her a big round of applause, yeah?

673
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,252
And when you do it,
everyone's gonna be on stage with you.

674
00:49:06,317 --> 00:49:10,058
lt's going to be a lot of fun. Okay?
You ready?

675
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,455
-Yep.
-All right, let's do it.

676
00:49:16,393 --> 00:49:17,829
Have fun.

677
00:49:41,151 --> 00:49:43,588
That was great. That was really good.

678
00:49:43,654 --> 00:49:45,892
She did a good iob.

679
00:49:45,957 --> 00:49:48,394
So the agency, they didn't send her?

680
00:49:48,459 --> 00:49:50,830
A different agency. She says she told me.

681
00:49:50,894 --> 00:49:52,797
l don't know. Maybe she did.
l don't remember.

682
00:49:52,863 --> 00:49:55,936
Well, do you feel all right about it now?
l mean, she explained everything.

683
00:49:56,001 --> 00:49:58,905
Yeah, l was never worried about her.
l mean, there's...

684
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:02,242
l don't know.
There's just kind of something about her.

685
00:50:02,306 --> 00:50:04,476
The kids call her Mrs. Miracle.

686
00:50:04,541 --> 00:50:06,645
-Miracle?
-l know.

687
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:10,217
But l got to say, when you're around her,
you just...

688
00:50:11,115 --> 00:50:14,421
You iust kind of feel like
it's gonna be okay.

689
00:50:14,485 --> 00:50:16,689
What's gonna be okay?

690
00:50:18,122 --> 00:50:19,424
Everything.

691
00:50:22,292 --> 00:50:24,729
Well, l can't wait to meet her.

692
00:50:26,497 --> 00:50:29,436
You should have dinner with us.
Sunday night.

693
00:50:30,367 --> 00:50:32,104
She's a great cook.

694
00:50:36,507 --> 00:50:38,477
Yeah. All right.

695
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,746
-Great.
-Great.

696
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:49,390
l mean, he's already inviting you over
to meet the family. That's not bad.

697
00:50:49,453 --> 00:50:51,657
No, it's not like that, okay?

698
00:50:51,722 --> 00:50:54,394
He has a new housekeeper,
and he just wants my opinion, so...

699
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:56,595
-Mrs. Miracle?
-Yeah.

700
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:59,365
l am a big fan.

701
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:02,969
Ever since she rode into Dodge, those boys,
they've been great.

702
00:51:03,033 --> 00:51:04,068
What do you mean?

703
00:51:04,133 --> 00:51:07,940
Well, it's not like the twins
were ever bad kids, but l don't know.

704
00:51:08,005 --> 00:51:10,944
lt's like they always knew something
was missing from their lives, you know?

705
00:51:11,008 --> 00:51:13,646
At first l thought it was
because they had lost their mother,

706
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:17,049
-but l don't think that's it.
-Well, then what is it?

707
00:51:17,113 --> 00:51:20,920
l don't know, but l get the feeling she does,
Mrs. Miracle.

708
00:51:44,875 --> 00:51:46,077
-Hi.
-Hi. How are you?

709
00:51:46,142 --> 00:51:48,012
l'm good. How are you?

710
00:51:49,546 --> 00:51:51,248
-This is for you.
-Thank you.

711
00:51:52,449 --> 00:51:55,086
-Hi.
-Reba, this is Mrs. Merkle.

712
00:51:55,151 --> 00:51:57,088
Emily Merkle, Reba Maxwell.

713
00:51:57,153 --> 00:52:00,460
Hi! Actually, l think that we've met before.

714
00:52:01,825 --> 00:52:05,532
Sort of. You dropped your bell
at the auditorium, and...

715
00:52:05,596 --> 00:52:09,235
What do you know? It's a small world, huh?

716
00:52:09,298 --> 00:52:11,068
Well, how nice to see you again.

717
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,136
Nice to see you, too.

718
00:52:12,201 --> 00:52:15,942
l hear your Christmas pageant's
gonna be a real smash!

719
00:52:16,006 --> 00:52:17,776
Well, we're getting there.

720
00:52:17,841 --> 00:52:19,443
Oh, yeah, you're getting there.

721
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,479
There's been a slight change of plan.

722
00:52:21,545 --> 00:52:25,251
l didn't know this, but Mrs. Merkle promised
she would take the boys to a movie tonight.

723
00:52:25,314 --> 00:52:26,850
l didn't know you made plans, so...

724
00:52:26,917 --> 00:52:30,557
But l got some soup on the stove
and a lovely baguette in the oven.

725
00:52:30,621 --> 00:52:32,390
That sounds fine.

726
00:52:32,455 --> 00:52:34,860
Holy cow, l'm gonna miss the previews.

727
00:52:34,925 --> 00:52:37,262
Listen, l've got to run,
but l'm sure you can manage.

728
00:52:37,326 --> 00:52:38,528
We'll be fine.

729
00:52:38,595 --> 00:52:41,232
Boys, come on.
We're gonna miss the previews!

730
00:52:42,933 --> 00:52:45,304
You know, l'm trying to figure out how

731
00:52:45,368 --> 00:52:49,275
have l been to all those stores
all those times and never seen you?

732
00:52:49,338 --> 00:52:51,943
l was wondering the same thing about you.

733
00:52:53,476 --> 00:52:56,582
l guess it's true what they say.
It's all in the timing.

734
00:52:56,646 --> 00:52:58,383
l guess.

735
00:52:58,447 --> 00:53:00,050
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

736
00:53:05,221 --> 00:53:06,423
So tell me, how does somebody go

737
00:53:06,489 --> 00:53:09,595
from working in the theater
to owning a travel agency?

738
00:53:11,561 --> 00:53:14,768
Well, they're not so different
if you think about it.

739
00:53:14,831 --> 00:53:19,774
l mean, they're both iust ways for people
to escape the real world for a while.

740
00:53:20,469 --> 00:53:21,905
l like that.

741
00:53:22,873 --> 00:53:26,479
As far as career paths go, escaping
the real world sounds pretty darn good.

742
00:53:26,542 --> 00:53:31,652
That actually wasn't the plan.
It was more of a fall-back position.

743
00:53:31,714 --> 00:53:33,350
What do you mean?

744
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,687
lt's a long story.

745
00:53:36,752 --> 00:53:37,753
l got time.

746
00:53:41,691 --> 00:53:44,931
l started the business after l was engaged.

747
00:53:45,661 --> 00:53:47,564
You were married?

748
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:48,698
No.

749
00:53:52,702 --> 00:53:54,072
l'm sorry.

750
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:59,577
l have no idea what l'm doing.

751
00:54:02,045 --> 00:54:03,113
lt's like l'm 15 again.

752
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:06,319
l can't get my brain and my mouth
in the same gear.

753
00:54:06,382 --> 00:54:07,784
What?

754
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:10,555
l haven't been on a date in years.

755
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:14,294
l have no idea what l'm supposed to do,
how l'm supposed to act. l mean, l'm...

756
00:54:14,357 --> 00:54:17,863
-l'm iust in way over my head here.
-Me, too.

757
00:54:17,927 --> 00:54:19,997
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

758
00:54:21,731 --> 00:54:25,271
l guess that's something else
that we both have in common.

759
00:55:05,508 --> 00:55:06,743
Hi!

760
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:08,979
Kate, go away.

761
00:55:10,146 --> 00:55:11,449
Oh, wow!

762
00:55:12,282 --> 00:55:15,388
-All right, wow.
-Those look great, you guys!

763
00:55:15,451 --> 00:55:17,020
Would you like Miss Maxwell to try one?

764
00:55:17,086 --> 00:55:18,154
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

765
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:20,792
Can l have one? Which one should l have?

766
00:55:20,856 --> 00:55:22,058
-That one.
-That one right there?

767
00:55:22,124 --> 00:55:24,127
All right, here we go.

768
00:55:24,193 --> 00:55:26,565
So are the boys happy
with their angel costumes?

769
00:55:28,731 --> 00:55:30,835
l think they were happy
with their swords, yeah.

770
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,903
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

771
00:55:32,968 --> 00:55:35,406
-There you go.
-Thank you, sir.

772
00:55:36,605 --> 00:55:38,307
Merry Christmas.

773
00:55:39,275 --> 00:55:42,815
''The ghost took Scrooge back
to Christmases of old

774
00:55:42,878 --> 00:55:46,785
''when Scrooge was warmhearted,
not sad and cold.

775
00:55:47,516 --> 00:55:51,523
''They saw Fan, his sister,
and Fezziwig, his boss.

776
00:55:51,587 --> 00:55:55,795
'''l was happy,' gasped Scrooge,
'not lonely and cross#

777
00:55:56,225 --> 00:55:59,565
''And as Scrooge was shown
each old Christmas Day,

778
00:55:59,628 --> 00:56:03,602
''he cried, 'l can't bear it! Take me away!'

779
00:56:09,171 --> 00:56:12,410
''ln the blink of an eye,
Scrooge returned to his bed

780
00:56:12,475 --> 00:56:15,514
''and was met by a iolly spirit who said,

781
00:56:15,578 --> 00:56:20,788
'''l am the good Ghost of Christmas Present.
Follow me now to see something pleasant.'''

782
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,025
And the kids, they're iust...
They're working so hard,

783
00:56:27,089 --> 00:56:30,228
and the show, l mean,
it's just really coming together.

784
00:56:30,292 --> 00:56:32,195
And you're enioying yourself?

785
00:56:32,261 --> 00:56:35,000
You know, l am. Imagine that.

786
00:56:35,297 --> 00:56:37,300
-That's great.
-Thanks.

787
00:56:38,634 --> 00:56:42,675
Well, Aunt Molly and Uncle Bill
are really looking forward to seeing you.

788
00:56:42,738 --> 00:56:44,340
l can't wait.

789
00:56:44,407 --> 00:56:47,012
Honey, l was wondering.

790
00:56:47,076 --> 00:56:49,681
Would it be possible for you to have

791
00:56:49,745 --> 00:56:52,750
Christmas dinner with them
on Christmas Eve?

792
00:56:53,581 --> 00:56:55,551
But l can't,
because l have the show, remember?

793
00:56:55,617 --> 00:56:58,155
Yeah, l know.
l just thought if it was possible

794
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:59,890
for you to make any other arrangements,
you know?

795
00:56:59,955 --> 00:57:01,357
Are you finished with that?

796
00:57:01,424 --> 00:57:03,427
Thank you.

797
00:57:03,491 --> 00:57:05,661
Thank you. That was great.

798
00:57:07,363 --> 00:57:09,801
This is about Vicki, isn't it?

799
00:57:10,966 --> 00:57:13,871
Doug and Vicki can't come
on Christmas Eve either.

800
00:57:13,936 --> 00:57:16,073
Doug's family is planning
on visiting his grandmother.

801
00:57:16,138 --> 00:57:19,043
She's almost 90.
Her health is not good, and so they...

802
00:57:19,108 --> 00:57:21,947
So, of course, Vicki decides
to spend Christmas Day with you,

803
00:57:22,011 --> 00:57:25,384
the only chance that l have to spend
with Aunt Molly and Uncle Bill, right?

804
00:57:25,448 --> 00:57:27,018
Yes, but she doesn't have a choice.

805
00:57:27,082 --> 00:57:31,390
She doesn't have a choice?
But l have to make other arrangements.

806
00:57:31,454 --> 00:57:33,191
You could still come on Christmas Day.

807
00:57:33,255 --> 00:57:37,196
l mean, iust set aside this silliness
with your sister.

808
00:57:37,259 --> 00:57:40,164
You call what Vicki did to me silliness?

809
00:57:40,229 --> 00:57:44,270
No. No, you know what l call silliness?

810
00:57:44,333 --> 00:57:47,072
Your behavior ever since.

811
00:57:47,136 --> 00:57:49,440
How many times does she have
to apologize?

812
00:57:49,504 --> 00:57:53,712
Why do you always defend her?
Mom, l was the one that was hurt.

813
00:57:53,775 --> 00:57:56,747
Reba, l think you've both been hurt enough.

814
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,582
Please, honey.

815
00:58:02,851 --> 00:58:04,588
You know what, Mom?

816
00:58:05,653 --> 00:58:07,456
Do whatever you want.

817
00:58:08,324 --> 00:58:09,325
Reba.

818
00:58:11,026 --> 00:58:15,534
l love you, Mom, but l don't think that we
should see each other for a while, okay?

819
00:58:15,597 --> 00:58:17,167
So Merry Christmas.

820
00:58:17,532 --> 00:58:18,567
Reba.

821
00:58:31,413 --> 00:58:32,548
Reba, hey.

822
00:58:35,717 --> 00:58:37,287
Can l talk to you?

823
00:58:37,719 --> 00:58:38,787
Absolutely. Come on in.

824
00:58:38,853 --> 00:58:40,189
Thanks.

825
00:58:44,226 --> 00:58:47,165
Four years ago, l was engaged to a teacher.

826
00:58:47,929 --> 00:58:49,966
His name was Joe Goddard,

827
00:58:50,031 --> 00:58:54,707
and l asked my older sister, Vicki,
to be my maid of honor.

828
00:58:54,769 --> 00:58:58,910
And l iust thought everything...
It was going to be perfect.

829
00:58:59,674 --> 00:59:04,149
But Vicki and l,
we'd always been very competitive.

830
00:59:04,213 --> 00:59:06,817
Sports, grades, you name it.

831
00:59:08,284 --> 00:59:10,421
And because she was older,

832
00:59:10,486 --> 00:59:14,192
l think she felt it was important
to outdo me,

833
00:59:14,256 --> 00:59:17,194
but l was the one
that was getting engaged first.

834
00:59:17,259 --> 00:59:20,097
l was getting married first,

835
00:59:20,161 --> 00:59:22,833
and l had no idea
how much that bothered her.

836
00:59:24,766 --> 00:59:26,503
What happened?

837
00:59:28,803 --> 00:59:32,343
The day before the wedding,
Joe called it off.

838
00:59:33,275 --> 00:59:37,181
He said that he changed his mind,
but he didn't tell me why.

839
00:59:38,347 --> 00:59:41,786
And it iust didn't make any sense.
You know, l...

840
00:59:41,849 --> 00:59:44,354
l thought that we were so happy.

841
00:59:45,887 --> 00:59:48,492
And then l found out the truth.

842
00:59:49,691 --> 00:59:52,295
The day we were supposed to get married,

843
00:59:52,361 --> 00:59:54,965
Joe and Vicki, they ran away together.

844
00:59:55,863 --> 00:59:58,668
They said that they'd fallen in love.

845
01:00:01,736 --> 01:00:03,639
l'm sorry.

846
01:00:03,705 --> 01:00:06,477
lt iust... You know, it felt like she planned it.

847
01:00:06,542 --> 01:00:10,048
Like it was iust another way for her to win.

848
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:14,818
And l haven't spoken to her since.

849
01:00:15,584 --> 01:00:18,322
And the irony is, is that
they were only together for a few months,

850
01:00:18,386 --> 01:00:21,258
and then he left her like he left me.

851
01:00:23,191 --> 01:00:28,000
And now, l mean, she's married
to somebody else, and they have a little girl.

852
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:31,869
And you're left to iust pick up the pieces.

853
01:00:33,501 --> 01:00:35,504
l mean, she keeps trying to apologize,

854
01:00:35,571 --> 01:00:39,010
and my family, they want me to forgive her
and to move on.

855
01:00:39,073 --> 01:00:41,310
But they don't understand.

856
01:00:42,578 --> 01:00:43,746
Do you?

857
01:00:46,014 --> 01:00:47,316
You were hurt.

858
01:00:48,116 --> 01:00:52,557
And more than that, you were betrayed
by the two people you trusted most.

859
01:00:54,288 --> 01:00:56,660
And you have to live with that.

860
01:00:57,626 --> 01:01:00,130
What do you do with the anger?

861
01:01:04,332 --> 01:01:05,835
Cookie break.

862
01:01:07,402 --> 01:01:10,074
-Okay?
-They've been in there a long time.

863
01:01:10,772 --> 01:01:13,543
What are they doing, Mrs. Miracle?

864
01:01:13,608 --> 01:01:18,484
Well, sometimes grown-ups need
to be alone to talk things over.

865
01:01:19,213 --> 01:01:20,615
What kind of things?

866
01:01:20,682 --> 01:01:25,458
Well, scientists have been trying
to figure that out for hundreds of years.

867
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,423
l'm not sure
they're ever going to figure it out,

868
01:01:27,488 --> 01:01:29,425
but l have my own theory.

869
01:01:33,294 --> 01:01:37,035
l think they're talking
about what they want for Christmas.

870
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:44,040
Have a cookie, sweetie.

871
01:01:45,973 --> 01:01:50,247
So you can't spend Christmas Eve
with your family, not with the pageant.

872
01:01:50,311 --> 01:01:52,448
lt's iust there's no time.

873
01:01:53,814 --> 01:01:56,085
And you don't want to visit
Christmas morning with your sister there.

874
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:57,252
No.

875
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:02,826
Well, looks like
you only have one other option.

876
01:02:03,958 --> 01:02:05,794
What?

877
01:02:05,859 --> 01:02:07,964
Spend Christmas with us.

878
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:11,333
No. No, l couldn't.

879
01:02:11,399 --> 01:02:12,467
Why not?

880
01:02:12,533 --> 01:02:16,340
Because you should spend Christmas
with the boys. l don't want to intrude.

881
01:02:28,382 --> 01:02:29,417
Hey, guys.

882
01:02:31,352 --> 01:02:32,854
-Hi.
-Hi.

883
01:02:34,422 --> 01:02:36,025
Guys, l got a question for you.

884
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:37,725
Yeah?

885
01:02:37,791 --> 01:02:40,263
Do you want Miss Maxwell
to spend Christmas with us?

886
01:02:40,328 --> 01:02:41,630
Yeah.

887
01:02:41,696 --> 01:02:42,764
Yeah?

888
01:02:42,829 --> 01:02:43,964
-Yeah!
-You sure?

889
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:45,433
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

890
01:02:47,702 --> 01:02:49,439
What do you say?

891
01:02:49,504 --> 01:02:51,374
-Okay.
-Yeah!

892
01:02:51,439 --> 01:02:53,242
Yeah! Cool!

893
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:58,148
So do you always leave your shopping
till the last minute?

894
01:02:58,212 --> 01:03:00,382
You know, every year l promise myself
l'm not going to do this,

895
01:03:00,448 --> 01:03:03,287
but then it iust... l don't know.

896
01:03:03,351 --> 01:03:05,120
Thank you for being with me.

897
01:03:05,186 --> 01:03:07,823
Are you kidding? And miss all this?

898
01:03:11,192 --> 01:03:13,863
So listen,
l was talking to the boys the other day,

899
01:03:13,927 --> 01:03:16,932
and they asked me if l knew their mother.

900
01:03:18,131 --> 01:03:19,467
What did you say?

901
01:03:19,534 --> 01:03:22,706
Well, what could l say?
That l'm sure she was a wonderful person,

902
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:24,673
but l didn't know her.

903
01:03:25,939 --> 01:03:30,047
l get the feeling
that they have a lot of questions about her.

904
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:32,315
They never ask me.

905
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:34,751
Well, maybe they're waiting
for you to talk about her.

906
01:03:34,816 --> 01:03:37,988
Well, they're young.
There's a lot of time left.

907
01:03:38,051 --> 01:03:40,723
Where are these ski, skates?
What are they...

908
01:03:40,788 --> 01:03:44,495
-Skate-skis? What are they?
-l don't know.

909
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:47,398
Maybe l should iust get them cash this year.
They'd like that.

910
01:03:47,461 --> 01:03:49,230
That's a good idea.

911
01:03:49,296 --> 01:03:50,432
Reba?

912
01:03:59,306 --> 01:04:00,876
lt's good to see you.

913
01:04:01,341 --> 01:04:03,646
Seth, this is my sister, Vicki.

914
01:04:14,789 --> 01:04:16,124
You haven't met.

915
01:04:16,791 --> 01:04:20,532
This is my husband, Doug, and this is Ellen.

916
01:04:21,629 --> 01:04:23,666
We have to go.

917
01:04:23,731 --> 01:04:27,404
Mom told me about the misunderstanding
for Christmas. l feel bad about that.

918
01:04:27,468 --> 01:04:30,005
-Really? Really?
-Doug and l talked it over.

919
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:32,007
We'll change our plans.

920
01:04:32,072 --> 01:04:33,742
-We can see his grandmother for New Year's.
-Yeah.

921
01:04:33,808 --> 01:04:37,247
You know what? That's fine,
because l have made other arrangements.

922
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:41,217
But, Reba,
l want you to be home for Christmas.

923
01:04:41,281 --> 01:04:44,387
Well, Vick,
we don't always get what we want, do we?

924
01:04:44,451 --> 01:04:47,089
That's something l learned from you.

925
01:04:47,954 --> 01:04:49,222
l'm sorry.

926
01:04:50,457 --> 01:04:53,396
Reba, you have no idea
how badly she feels about...

927
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:55,598
Doug, it won't do any good.

928
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:01,937
Take care.

929
01:05:15,649 --> 01:05:16,650
You okay?

930
01:05:19,319 --> 01:05:20,889
Let's try a different store, okay?

931
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:33,536
Then Ms. Miracle took us, and we put
all the stuff in the Christmas baskets.

932
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:37,507
-Yeah, turkey and cranberry sauce.
-And candies and stuff for dessert,

933
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:40,142
so other families
can have Christmas dinner, too.

934
01:05:40,206 --> 01:05:43,980
You guys did a great iob.
l'm very proud of you for helping.

935
01:05:44,778 --> 01:05:47,383
l told the boys
that we'd walk in the neighborhood

936
01:05:47,447 --> 01:05:49,784
-and see all the Christmas lights.
-That's a great idea.

937
01:05:49,850 --> 01:05:52,454
Would you two like to tag along with us?

938
01:05:52,519 --> 01:05:55,691
You know, why don't we stay and clean up?

939
01:05:57,858 --> 01:06:00,863
Well, thank you.
Come on, boys, get your coats.

940
01:06:07,367 --> 01:06:10,974
Hey, look,
just what happened today with my sister,

941
01:06:11,037 --> 01:06:12,839
l'm sorry.

942
01:06:12,907 --> 01:06:15,278
lt wasn't fair to put you in the middle of that.

943
01:06:15,342 --> 01:06:17,646
No, no, no, l'm glad l was there.

944
01:06:17,711 --> 01:06:18,947
l saw how hard it is for you.

945
01:06:21,715 --> 01:06:24,220
But you know what?

946
01:06:24,284 --> 01:06:26,321
l think it might have been a good thing.

947
01:06:26,386 --> 01:06:29,892
-What do you mean?
-She's really reaching out.

948
01:06:29,956 --> 01:06:31,659
l think maybe if you gave her a chance...

949
01:06:31,725 --> 01:06:34,063
Yeah, but l mean,
how could l ever trust her again?

950
01:06:34,127 --> 01:06:36,831
Yeah, true,
but you can't let it control your life.

951
01:06:36,896 --> 01:06:37,999
lt doesn't.

952
01:06:38,064 --> 01:06:40,101
Yeah, but you're giving up a chance
to see your aunt and uncle

953
01:06:40,166 --> 01:06:43,505
who you genuinely care about,
because you're angry at your sister.

954
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:47,110
No, l told you that

955
01:06:47,807 --> 01:06:50,913
l want to spend the day
with you and the boys.

956
01:06:52,145 --> 01:06:55,049
Look, l know you think
you're punishing Vicki by not being there,

957
01:06:55,115 --> 01:06:57,953
but the one who's really losing out is you.

958
01:07:00,086 --> 01:07:03,425
So you are saying
that you agree with everyone else.

959
01:07:04,424 --> 01:07:07,229
So l should iust pretend
like that never happened, right?

960
01:07:07,293 --> 01:07:09,397
No, no, no, no, no.
That's not what l'm saying at all.

961
01:07:09,462 --> 01:07:12,033
l'm saying if you iust talked to her...

962
01:07:12,097 --> 01:07:14,435
-There's nothing to talk about.
-Come on.

963
01:07:14,501 --> 01:07:16,771
You don't think this is hard for her, too?

964
01:07:16,836 --> 01:07:18,873
l mean, you saw her. l mean...

965
01:07:18,938 --> 01:07:21,176
Knowing that she hurt you,
not being able to see you.

966
01:07:21,241 --> 01:07:23,511
-Don't defend her.
-l'm not.

967
01:07:23,576 --> 01:07:26,515
Look, you're the one l care about.

968
01:07:27,614 --> 01:07:29,951
Okay? l want to see you happy.

969
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:36,625
There's some things that l have to do, so...

970
01:07:38,458 --> 01:07:39,726
Thank you for dinner.

971
01:07:39,793 --> 01:07:43,032
-Reba. Reba, wait.
-l'll call you.

972
01:07:54,841 --> 01:07:59,282
So the set should be ready by tomorrow.
We're in good shape for costumes.

973
01:08:01,948 --> 01:08:06,256
Seth must be pretty busy, huh? l haven't
seen him around the last couple days.

974
01:08:06,318 --> 01:08:07,654
Yeah.

975
01:08:08,621 --> 01:08:10,290
Well, you know,
he's been at so many rehearsals,

976
01:08:10,355 --> 01:08:13,895
he probably knows the show by heart
at this point.

977
01:08:17,664 --> 01:08:19,701
You know, kiddo,
these things are great for staying in shape,

978
01:08:19,766 --> 01:08:22,303
but they're no good for running away.

979
01:08:22,367 --> 01:08:24,070
What do you mean?

980
01:08:28,641 --> 01:08:31,580
-What's going on with you two?
-Nothing.

981
01:08:32,444 --> 01:08:33,780
Nothing?

982
01:08:33,847 --> 01:08:38,255
As in, everything's okay nothing?
As in, it couldn't be better nothing?

983
01:08:38,317 --> 01:08:41,256
As in, l don't think it's going to work out.

984
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:42,523
What?

985
01:08:42,589 --> 01:08:46,162
l have to get back to work.
l'll see you at rehearsal, okay?

986
01:08:46,225 --> 01:08:47,360
Reba.

987
01:08:51,831 --> 01:08:52,999
Reba.

988
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:08,215
-Hello, Mrs. Merkle.
-l hope l'm not interrupting.

989
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:09,816
No, it's fine. What's up?

990
01:09:09,883 --> 01:09:12,454
l was wondering if you could pick up
the boys after rehearsal?

991
01:09:14,888 --> 01:09:16,758
No, l'm not gonna have time.
You'd better do it.

992
01:09:16,823 --> 01:09:21,097
Are you sure?
Because they look so forward to seeing you,

993
01:09:21,161 --> 01:09:24,701
and l hear there's a lot of work to do
before the show's ready.

994
01:09:24,764 --> 01:09:26,199
l'm sure they'll be fine without me.

995
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,035
Listen, l've got to go.

996
01:09:28,101 --> 01:09:30,739
l'll be home for dinner, though, okay?

997
01:09:33,039 --> 01:09:36,245
Why do they always have
to make it so complicated?

998
01:09:56,395 --> 01:09:58,332
-l'm sorry.
-You go ahead, honey.

999
01:09:58,397 --> 01:10:00,501
Thank you very much.

1000
01:10:01,968 --> 01:10:03,103
Merry Christmas.

1001
01:10:03,169 --> 01:10:04,839
Merry Christmas.

1002
01:10:04,904 --> 01:10:07,174
-Find everything okay today?
-Yes, l did.

1003
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:13,013
Holy cow!

1004
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,415
What? What?

1005
01:10:16,481 --> 01:10:18,685
You're our millionth customer.

1006
01:10:19,718 --> 01:10:21,421
You won a trip!

1007
01:10:24,456 --> 01:10:26,626
-Merry Christmas.
-Thank you!

1008
01:10:28,493 --> 01:10:29,494
l can't believe it!

1009
01:10:29,895 --> 01:10:34,437
She what? Don't tell me that,
because, l mean, she can't just be gone.

1010
01:10:34,499 --> 01:10:38,740
Yeah, well, that's what her note says.
Mrs. Darling won a trip to Fiji.

1011
01:10:39,705 --> 01:10:41,075
The one-millionth customer?

1012
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:42,375
Yeah. Did you read how it said

1013
01:10:42,441 --> 01:10:44,678
that the woman in the store
Iet her go in front of her in line?

1014
01:10:44,743 --> 01:10:48,217
lt was like she had this angel
on her shoulder, or...

1015
01:10:50,716 --> 01:10:52,319
Which is so totally not the point,

1016
01:10:52,384 --> 01:10:55,656
but according to the rules,
she has to be there for Christmas, so...

1017
01:10:55,721 --> 01:10:57,191
Kate, what are we going to do?

1018
01:10:57,257 --> 01:11:00,596
l mean, our pianist is on a slow boat to Fiii,
and we're supposed to open in two days.

1019
01:11:00,659 --> 01:11:03,364
Well, we're gonna find someone else to play.

1020
01:11:03,428 --> 01:11:06,333
This isn't about iust pounding out
a few songs on the piano.

1021
01:11:06,398 --> 01:11:08,902
l mean, Mrs. Darling, she knows
the show backwards and forwards.

1022
01:11:08,967 --> 01:11:11,472
l mean, the kids,
they take all of their cues from her.

1023
01:11:11,536 --> 01:11:13,306
Their entrances, their exits, all of their lines.

1024
01:11:13,372 --> 01:11:17,346
l mean, there's no way
that we can do this show without her!

1025
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:25,885
Okay.

1026
01:11:43,201 --> 01:11:44,671
Reba.

1027
01:11:44,736 --> 01:11:48,443
Hi. Sorry to take you away from the meeting.
l just wanted to talk to you.

1028
01:11:48,507 --> 01:11:49,842
Yeah, what's up?

1029
01:11:50,842 --> 01:11:54,983
Apparently, Mrs. Darling has always wanted
to go to Fiji.

1030
01:11:55,047 --> 01:11:58,253
Okay. l'm having trouble picturing her
in a grass skirt, but...

1031
01:11:58,318 --> 01:12:00,555
-She left today.
-You're serious.

1032
01:12:00,619 --> 01:12:03,658
Yeah, and we need a piano player,
and not just any piano player, Seth.

1033
01:12:03,722 --> 01:12:07,529
We need someone that knows the pageant
inside and out. We need you.

1034
01:12:12,264 --> 01:12:13,734
l don't play piano.

1035
01:12:13,799 --> 01:12:17,840
l know, and you know that l wouldn't ask
unless it was really important.

1036
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:21,340
You know why l can't.

1037
01:12:23,041 --> 01:12:25,078
So you won't help me?

1038
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,450
l'm sorry.

1039
01:12:34,052 --> 01:12:35,488
So am l.

1040
01:12:49,668 --> 01:12:50,836
Reba.

1041
01:12:52,704 --> 01:12:54,039
Reba.

1042
01:12:54,106 --> 01:12:57,546
You had no right to ask me to do that.
You know l can't.

1043
01:12:57,609 --> 01:13:00,213
-No, you mean you won't.
-No, l can't.

1044
01:13:01,412 --> 01:13:03,048
Music was something
that l shared with Pamela.

1045
01:13:03,115 --> 01:13:04,918
l stopped playing the day she died.

1046
01:13:04,983 --> 01:13:07,722
Seth, the music, it didn't die with her.

1047
01:13:07,786 --> 01:13:09,221
For me, it did.

1048
01:13:09,287 --> 01:13:11,792
And is that why you never talk about her?
Is that why your boys,

1049
01:13:11,857 --> 01:13:15,430
-they know nothing about their mother?
-That's none of your business.

1050
01:13:15,493 --> 01:13:17,931
They miss her. You can't even see it,

1051
01:13:17,996 --> 01:13:20,935
because you're more interested
in holding onto your grief.

1052
01:13:20,999 --> 01:13:22,568
You don't know anything about it.

1053
01:13:22,633 --> 01:13:25,271
So you'd rather forget the pageant
and disappoint your sons

1054
01:13:25,337 --> 01:13:26,338
than let go of the past?

1055
01:13:26,405 --> 01:13:29,444
l can't believe you're saying this
to me right now. You, of all people.

1056
01:13:29,507 --> 01:13:32,780
-You need to take a good look in the mirror.
-What is that supposed to mean?

1057
01:13:32,844 --> 01:13:36,217
Your sister did a terrible thing,
but the world didn't stop turning.

1058
01:13:36,281 --> 01:13:39,153
That is completely different! She hurt me.

1059
01:13:39,217 --> 01:13:41,287
Yeah, and you took that hurt,
and you locked it so deep inside

1060
01:13:41,353 --> 01:13:43,991
that nobody can get at it, not even you.

1061
01:13:44,055 --> 01:13:45,958
You are iust like everyone else, you know?
l really...

1062
01:13:46,024 --> 01:13:48,863
l can't believe that l thought
that you would understand.

1063
01:13:48,927 --> 01:13:51,064
No, you know what? l do understand.

1064
01:13:51,129 --> 01:13:53,934
l understand because l regret
every single day that went by

1065
01:13:53,999 --> 01:13:56,603
that l didn't tell Pamela that l loved her.

1066
01:13:56,667 --> 01:13:59,005
And it's too late for me,
but it's not too late for you.

1067
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:02,176
You can still make things right
with your sister.

1068
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,876
You want me to forget?

1069
01:14:03,942 --> 01:14:05,945
l want you to forgive.

1070
01:14:07,379 --> 01:14:11,153
Let go of the anger. Get on with your life.

1071
01:14:11,216 --> 01:14:14,221
The way that you've gotten on with yours?

1072
01:14:17,389 --> 01:14:19,693
We're iust wasting our time, aren't we?

1073
01:14:19,757 --> 01:14:20,926
Yeah, l think so.

1074
01:14:35,506 --> 01:14:37,343
Honey, don't move.

1075
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:41,382
Mrs. Maxwell said
there might not be a pageant.

1076
01:14:41,446 --> 01:14:44,685
-There's nobody to play the piano.
-That is a problem.

1077
01:14:44,748 --> 01:14:47,053
Could you do something, Mrs. Miracle?

1078
01:14:47,118 --> 01:14:51,125
Well, sometimes the best thing to do
is have faith it'll turn out for the best.

1079
01:14:51,189 --> 01:14:52,591
And people don't even know what that is.

1080
01:14:52,656 --> 01:14:57,399
Sometimes it's right in front of them,
but eventually, they figure it out.

1081
01:14:57,462 --> 01:15:00,067
So long as they don't wait too long.

1082
01:15:03,101 --> 01:15:06,807
-Do we have to wear a dress?
-lt's not a dress, darling.

1083
01:15:06,871 --> 01:15:08,107
lt's a gown.

1084
01:15:08,173 --> 01:15:11,412
A gown is a fancy word for a dress.

1085
01:15:11,476 --> 01:15:14,248
-l don't want to be an angel!
-Me neither!

1086
01:15:14,312 --> 01:15:15,814
Hey, Dad!

1087
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:17,483
You guys look really cute.

1088
01:15:17,548 --> 01:15:20,353
-Told you we look stupid!
-l don't want to wear a dress!

1089
01:15:20,418 --> 01:15:23,257
All right.
There's a plate for you in the refrigerator.

1090
01:15:23,321 --> 01:15:24,656
Thank you.

1091
01:15:25,423 --> 01:15:28,027
And we're not going to do it!

1092
01:15:28,092 --> 01:15:31,566
Well, l understand,
but l wish you had told me before.

1093
01:15:31,629 --> 01:15:32,664
Before what?

1094
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:34,500
Before l made the swords.

1095
01:15:34,565 --> 01:15:36,268
-Swords?
-Swords?

1096
01:15:36,334 --> 01:15:39,707
Yes, swords. Well, you don't know
very much about angels. That's for sure.

1097
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:41,840
Angels got swords?

1098
01:15:41,906 --> 01:15:44,578
Yes, they sure do, and let me tell you,

1099
01:15:44,642 --> 01:15:47,647
some of them are very fierce
with them, so l hear.

1100
01:15:47,711 --> 01:15:52,687
And a few of them are known
as warriors around the heavenly choir,

1101
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:56,624
and they fight mighty battles,
but only for a good cause.

1102
01:15:57,254 --> 01:16:00,126
-Warrior angels.
-That's what we'll be!

1103
01:16:00,758 --> 01:16:04,465
Okay. But now you still have to wear a gown.

1104
01:16:04,529 --> 01:16:06,198
As long as we have a sword.

1105
01:16:06,263 --> 01:16:08,468
Warrior angels!

1106
01:16:12,703 --> 01:16:15,775
Christmas will never be the same
after this pageant.

1107
01:16:17,908 --> 01:16:19,511
Be careful, honey. Be careful.

1108
01:16:53,545 --> 01:16:55,916
No! No, no, no. No!

1109
01:16:59,416 --> 01:17:01,386
Oh, gosh, Reba!

1110
01:17:11,862 --> 01:17:13,431
Lose something?

1111
01:17:17,668 --> 01:17:19,772
Technically, it's yours.

1112
01:17:20,537 --> 01:17:23,476
Well, consider it your Christmas present.

1113
01:17:24,608 --> 01:17:26,478
Thank you.

1114
01:17:26,543 --> 01:17:28,648
Feels good, doesn't it?

1115
01:17:28,712 --> 01:17:29,713
What's that?

1116
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:33,219
Getting something back,
something you thought you lost forever.

1117
01:17:35,719 --> 01:17:37,288
Yeah.

1118
01:17:37,354 --> 01:17:39,792
Doesn't happen every day.

1119
01:17:39,857 --> 01:17:43,163
Getting something back that you love.

1120
01:17:43,227 --> 01:17:47,368
So grab hold of it tight, honey,
'cause you may not get a second chance.

1121
01:17:50,167 --> 01:17:51,970
Merry Christmas, Reba.

1122
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:55,741
Merry Christmas, Mrs. Merkle.

1123
01:17:58,409 --> 01:18:01,047
Mrs. Merkle, do you want a ride home?

1124
01:18:01,912 --> 01:18:04,851
Thanks, honey, no.
l like to look at the lights.

1125
01:18:04,915 --> 01:18:05,983
Okay.

1126
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,195
Hi.

1127
01:18:52,196 --> 01:18:53,731
Reba.

1128
01:18:53,796 --> 01:18:55,099
Hi, Doug.

1129
01:18:55,733 --> 01:18:57,269
What are you doing here?

1130
01:18:57,334 --> 01:18:59,871
l was...

1131
01:18:59,936 --> 01:19:02,541
Well, l was iust wondering if...

1132
01:19:03,574 --> 01:19:05,144
ls Vicki around?

1133
01:19:05,209 --> 01:19:06,811
Doug, who is it?

1134
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:13,985
Reba.

1135
01:19:14,851 --> 01:19:16,187
Vicki.

1136
01:19:20,022 --> 01:19:21,592
Please forgive me.

1137
01:19:21,658 --> 01:19:24,196
l'm sorry.

1138
01:19:24,261 --> 01:19:26,264
l'm...

1139
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:27,832
l'm so sorry.

1140
01:19:29,999 --> 01:19:31,569
l've missed you so much.

1141
01:21:20,844 --> 01:21:27,189
''Deep in the night before Christmas Day,
three spirits will come to show you the way.

1142
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:30,755
-''With that Marley's ghost...''
-Hey, guys.

1143
01:21:30,821 --> 01:21:35,764
l was thinking maybe l'll read to you tonight
if that's okay.

1144
01:21:35,826 --> 01:21:36,861
Sure.

1145
01:21:36,926 --> 01:21:40,065
-Okay.
-What are you going to read to us, Daddy?

1146
01:21:40,129 --> 01:21:43,435
-ls it a Christmas book?
-Kind of, yeah.

1147
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:46,436
Yeah.

1148
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:50,675
These are pictures
from your guys' very first Christmas.

1149
01:21:50,741 --> 01:21:53,412
Does it have pictures of Mommy in it?

1150
01:21:56,545 --> 01:21:59,752
-She's beautiful.
-Yes, she is beautiful.

1151
01:22:03,419 --> 01:22:05,689
Her favorite color was blue.

1152
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:14,399
That's a picture of the three of you guys
in front of our Christmas tree.

1153
01:22:14,463 --> 01:22:16,066
Which one is me?

1154
01:22:19,836 --> 01:22:21,772
You know, l don't know.

1155
01:22:22,906 --> 01:22:24,775
But now your mom,
she could always tell you guys apart,

1156
01:22:24,841 --> 01:22:26,643
even from the very beginning.

1157
01:22:26,709 --> 01:22:28,379
How?

1158
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:30,314
Radar.

1159
01:22:30,379 --> 01:22:34,653
That's what she said, seriously.
That's what she used to call it.

1160
01:22:34,717 --> 01:22:36,821
She said she had radar.

1161
01:22:49,332 --> 01:22:51,703
Boys, come here.

1162
01:22:51,767 --> 01:22:53,637
How do we look, Mrs. Miracle?

1163
01:22:53,703 --> 01:22:56,508
Like Judd and Jason in a box.

1164
01:22:56,572 --> 01:22:58,275
Judd and Jason,
do you want to go take your places?

1165
01:22:58,341 --> 01:22:59,409
-Okay.
-We'll start soon.

1166
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:01,278
You have done so well

1167
01:23:01,344 --> 01:23:04,950
that you may have talked yourself
into a job for the next 10 years or more.

1168
01:23:05,014 --> 01:23:09,622
Thank you, but whoever heard of
a Christmas pageant without a piano player?

1169
01:23:09,685 --> 01:23:13,392
Act as if you have faith,
and faith will be given to you,

1170
01:23:13,456 --> 01:23:16,528
and if that doesn't work, fake it.

1171
01:23:21,564 --> 01:23:25,070
Okay, everyone, three minutes.
Let's get in our places, okay?

1172
01:23:25,134 --> 01:23:27,872
Let's go. We've got presents up here,
candy canes in the back.

1173
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:46,223
Good evening, everybody.

1174
01:23:46,288 --> 01:23:49,293
l would like to thank you
for coming tonight.

1175
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:52,831
When my good friend Kate asked me
to direct the pageant,

1176
01:23:52,895 --> 01:23:56,034
l believe my exact words were,
''You've gotta be kidding me.''

1177
01:23:58,467 --> 01:24:01,038
But she wasn't, and l'm happy for that now,

1178
01:24:01,102 --> 01:24:06,178
because l have enioyed every minute
that l've spent with your children.

1179
01:24:06,241 --> 01:24:10,650
l've learned a lot from them
in the last few weeks

1180
01:24:10,713 --> 01:24:15,088
about the things that matter,
and the things that don't,

1181
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:18,155
and iust how easy it is to confuse the two.

1182
01:24:20,022 --> 01:24:22,159
And one more announcement
before we begin tonight.

1183
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:26,365
Our pianist, Mrs. Darling,
had to leave the show unexpectedly.

1184
01:24:26,429 --> 01:24:31,271
l couldn't ask for taped music
to possibly replace her, but...

1185
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:44,851
But Seth Webster has kindly offered
to play for us this evening.

1186
01:24:44,914 --> 01:24:48,120
So thank you, Mr. Webster,
and enjoy the show.

1187
01:24:55,524 --> 01:24:57,093
Thank you. Thank you.

1188
01:24:57,158 --> 01:25:00,130
Listen, what l said before, l was out of line.

1189
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:02,432
-l didn't...
-Seth, you were right.

1190
01:25:02,498 --> 01:25:04,400
You were, and Vicki's here.

1191
01:25:08,671 --> 01:25:10,473
l'm glad.

1192
01:25:10,539 --> 01:25:12,441
l couldn't have done it without you.

1193
01:25:12,507 --> 01:25:13,877
That makes two of us.

1194
01:25:16,112 --> 01:25:18,349
Can you stay here and give me my cues?

1195
01:25:18,413 --> 01:25:20,350
l'm not going anywhere.

1196
01:25:22,051 --> 01:25:24,054
Ready? And go.

1197
01:26:50,139 --> 01:26:54,247
And the angel said unto them, ''Fear not.

1198
01:26:54,309 --> 01:26:58,150
''For behold,
l bring you good tidings of great joy.''

1199
01:27:35,117 --> 01:27:36,452
Bravo!

1200
01:28:37,478 --> 01:28:39,615
-Mrs. Miracle, did you see us?
-Mrs. Miracle, did you see us?

1201
01:28:39,681 --> 01:28:41,150
You were wonderful!

1202
01:28:41,215 --> 01:28:43,553
l'm so proud of both of you.

1203
01:28:44,686 --> 01:28:47,925
l have something very important to tell you.

1204
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,530
l love you both so much,

1205
01:28:54,595 --> 01:28:57,834
but l have to leave now.

1206
01:28:57,899 --> 01:28:59,401
What do you mean?

1207
01:28:59,467 --> 01:29:02,806
Honey, there are other families
and little children who need me.

1208
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:04,405
What about us?

1209
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,477
lt's very hard for you
to understand it right now,

1210
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:12,216
but everything's gonna turn out all right
from now on.

1211
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:15,119
-You promise?
-l definitely promise.

1212
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:16,553
Oh, look.

1213
01:29:22,590 --> 01:29:24,560
Come here, you two.

1214
01:29:30,798 --> 01:29:35,039
Hey, and listen,
l want you to look after things for me here,

1215
01:29:35,103 --> 01:29:38,677
'cause you never know
when l might drop in again.

1216
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:40,375
Judd! Jason!

1217
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:43,212
There's your dad calling you.

1218
01:29:43,277 --> 01:29:46,182
-We're here, Dad!
-Over here!

1219
01:29:47,447 --> 01:29:50,319
-Where are you guys?
-We're over here!

1220
01:29:52,253 --> 01:29:56,327
Come here! You guys were so good.

1221
01:29:57,091 --> 01:30:00,063
You guys did really, really well.
l'm so proud of you.

1222
01:30:00,128 --> 01:30:03,234
-You two were amazing.
-Where's Mrs. Miracle?

1223
01:30:05,266 --> 01:30:08,639
-What? What's so funny?
-You called her Mrs. Miracle.

1224
01:30:12,039 --> 01:30:14,710
Well, it's her name, isn't it?

1225
01:30:18,045 --> 01:30:19,580
There she is.

1226
01:30:21,883 --> 01:30:24,053
l wonder where she's going.

1227
01:30:27,221 --> 01:30:28,857
l don't know.

1228
01:30:45,373 --> 01:30:46,541
Let's go home.
