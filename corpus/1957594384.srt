Evening, Lily.

 to the old timers

 back when they were men here.

 fine without them.

 feel like something's missing?

 all the guys anyway?

 old timers tell it,

 they were smart men.

 can experience what it's

 responsibilities.

 me not to let you go anywhere

180
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,590
because you might be dangerous.

181
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,450

Well, I'd like to see
 somebody just try and stop me.

183
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,570
Wait!

184
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,040
[MUSIC PLAYING]

185
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,730
I will take that.

186
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,930
Thank you very much.

187
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,370
Sheriff Parker!

188
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,260
Sheriff Parker!

189
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,940
The man's getting away.

190
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,450
Let me guess.

191
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,790
Wild Lil [INAUDIBLE].

192
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:06,090
I told him to stay put,
 but he wouldn't listen.

193
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,190
The name is
 Parker, Sarah Parker.

194
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,110
And I'm the sheriff
 in these here parts.

195
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,010
Great.

196
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,060
I hate women cops.

197
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,920
Well, bad luck for you.

198
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,750
Look, why don't you just come
 along with me to the jail

199
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,770
and we can end this
 thing peacefully?

200
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,120
I've got a better idea.

201
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,690
Why don't you get out of
 my way, or I'm going to fry

202
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:28,320
your ass like a side of bacon?

203
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,830
Looks like you're a little
 outgunned, [INAUDIBLE]..

204
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,960
It was a joke.

205
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,470
I was just kidding.

206
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,930
You girls have no
 sense of humor.

207
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,370
Looks like you're going to
 be my guest for a little while.

208
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,070
WOMAN: That's right.

209
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,800
You tell him.

210
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,690
Hey, baby, I know my rights.

211
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,180
What about my phone call?

212
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,220
We don't have any phones here.

213
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,320
OK, well, what
 about my-- my lawyer?

214
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,270
Don't I get fair legal counsel?

215
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,150
There's a little thing
 here called Frontier Justice.

216
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:06,140
This here badge gives me
 the right to do whatever

217
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,810
I see fit to carry out the law.

218
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:11,150
Nice badge.

219
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,040
You got a name, Tex?

220
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,880
Look, don't call me Tex.

221
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,420
It makes me feel like I'm
 in an all-female episode

222
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,740
of Gunsmoke or something.

223
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,590
Look, my name is
 Commander Steve Rogers.

224
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,630
I'm from Earth.

225
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,970
Commander?

226
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,070
You made that up.

227
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,420
No, I didn't.

228
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,080
You mean to tell me that they
 gave a rank like that to a man?

229
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,240
Look, dollface, where I'm
 from, things are done a little

230
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,410
differently.

231
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,110
Oh, so you're telling me
 that the men run your world?

232
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,910
No, I didn't exactly say that.

233
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,480
OK, then the women run it.

234
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,020
No, I didn't exactly--

235
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,440
look, you're screwing me up.

236
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,540
Trust me, space man.

237
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,810
It wasn't that hard to do.

238
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,330
Whew!

239
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:57,100
My goodness, it certainly
 is getting hot in here.

240
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,310
Yeah, hot.

241
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,190
Can I ask you a question,
 Commander Steve Rogers?

242
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,040
No, just Commander Steve.

243
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,430
OK, just Commander Steve.

244
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,090
How is it where you come from?

245
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,990
How's what?

246
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,440
You know, sex.

247
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,140
What's it like?

248
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,920
It's pretty good, actually.

249
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,750
Yeah, it's pretty good.

250
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,190
Hey, wait a minute.

251
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,120
Wait a minute.

252
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,650
I'm on Cosmic Bloopers and
 Practical Jokes, ain't I?

253
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,380
I knew it!

254
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,080
I knew it.

255
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,350
Somebody's going to
 come in here soon,

256
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,070
and we're going to cut
 to commercial, right?

257
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,520
You know, I don't
 have the slightest

258
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,870
idea what you're talking about.

259
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,820
But I like it.

260
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,520
Oh, boy.

261
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,300
Don't you want to
 know what I might

262
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,080
have on under this outfit?

263
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,150
Chaps?

264
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,800
Or maybe nothing at all.

265
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:59,450
I don't think this is
 standard police procedure.

266
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,620
No, it's that
 frontier justice thing.

267
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,390
Well, it sure beats
 the hell out of getting

268
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,740
hung by the old oak tree.

269
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,590
Howdy, Lily.

270
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,800
How's your patient?

271
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,950
Oh, in jail.

272
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:23,910
In jail?

273
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:28,510
Well, he sort of woke up,
 and then he sort of got loose.

274
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,350
Then he sort of went apeshit
 in the middle of town.

275
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,200
And then Sheriff Parker comes
 through to put him in jail.

276
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,160
I leave you girls
 alone for one hour.

277
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,600
Do you think Parker's
 prettier than me?

278
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,480
What?

279
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,910
Now why would you ask
 me a question like that?

280
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,690
I don't know.

281
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,330
You've never asked
 me a question like that

282
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:51,060
before, Lily.

283
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,890
Well, I never thought
 about it before.

284
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,380
You never thought
 about it before

285
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,820
because there was
 never any reason

286
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,740
to think about it before, Lily.

287
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,180
What do you mean?

288
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,800
I mean, you're
 concerned about your looks

289
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,270
because there's a man
 around, and you're

290
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,520
worried that Sheriff
 Parker is going

291
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,670
to take that man away from you.

292
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,750
Well, he is kind of cute.

293
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,690
Cute, ha.

294
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,250
That's how it all starts.

295
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,950
First everybody thinks he's a
 woman with a 5 o'clock shadow.

296
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,780
Now everybody thinks he's cute.

297
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,550
Next thing you know, he's
 going to be standing around

298
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,010
in a mine shaft,
 saying, gee, I wonder

299
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:23,670
what that rumbling sound is.

300
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,390
Take my advice, Lily.

301
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,000
Don't get attached to him.

302
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,960
Why not?

303
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,030
Because men leave,
 that's why not.

304
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,940
They also always forget to
 put the toilet seat back down.

305
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,500
It never works out.

306
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,890
They always wind up
 breaking your heart.

307
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:38,590
Trust me.

308
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,040
Now you're going to be
 a model prisoner, right?

309
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,290
Oh, boy.

310
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,760
Wow.

311
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,350
How do you manage to walk
 around with something

312
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,200
like that sticking out of you?

313
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,910
What?

314
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,610
That.

315
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,490
Oh, well, it's
 not always that big.

316
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,230
I mean, it's a
 special circumstance.

317
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,840
Space man.

318
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,240
Yeah?

319
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,530
You're going to
 be my bitch tonight.

320
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,540
Shit.

321
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,920
I'm handcuffed.

322
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:23,060
I'm in jail, and my butt hurts.

323
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,340
This is not good.

324
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,760
Kinky.

325
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,720
Let me guess, Sheriff Parker did
 her frontier justice routine,

326
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,570
right?

327
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,940
And who the hell do
 you supposed to be,

328
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,340
the town's school marm?

329
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,830
I happen to be the
 mayor of Pucker Bush.

330
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,410
The mayor, right.

331
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,240
OK, mayor.

332
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,370
I need to make a long
 distance phone call.

333
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,510
To where?

334
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,460
To Earth?

335
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,450
Well, I'm afraid you're out
 of luck there, Commander Rogers.

336
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,490
You see, all our communication
 equipment was in the mine shaft

337
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,100
when it collapsed on
 the men 20 years ago.

338
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,720
You're kidding, right?

339
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,970
Needless to say, Pucker
 Bush was voted Dumbest

340
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,420
Planet of the Year that year.

341
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,120
OK, well, how about this?

342
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,990
How about you give me my
 transgalactic communicator,

343
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,810
and I'll try and
 fix it or something?

344
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:12,710
Why?

345
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,380
So you could pull that same
 stunt you did in town square?

346
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,690
Hey, I was under
 duress at the time.

347
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,940
That's no excuse,
 and you know it.

348
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,030
In fact, oh, girls.

349
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,440
What are you doing?

350
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,800
Well, Commander Rogers, there
 happen to be laws in this town.

351
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,440
And you happen to have
 broken several of them

352
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,780
Yeah, so?

353
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,480
So there has to be a trial.

354
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,950
A trial?

355
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,120
I have to go to court?

356
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,710
This is the wild frontier.

357
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,380
There are no courts.

358
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:49,090
[INAUDIBLE] serve as judge,
 jury, and executioner.

359
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,330
Oh, come on, lady.

360
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,740
I didn't hurt anybody.

361
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,680
I'm not even from here.

362
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,600
Do you honestly think
 that I meant to land here?

363
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,750
When in Rome, do
 as the Romans do.

364
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,910
Rome?

365
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,110
There were guys in
 Rome, chickie poo.

366
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,950
Chickie poo?

367
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,110
He is really asking for it.

368
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,480
What's going on?

369
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,830
Oh, no.

370
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,530
Oh, fuck.

371
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:27,820
[APPLAUSE]

372
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,520
Please let this be one of
 those guilty conscience

373
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,570
dreams that I get whenever
 I sleep with some chick

374
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,240
and then I leave her
 place before she wakes up.

375
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,820
Greetings, spare
 citizens of Pucker Bush.

376
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,530
Thanks for the great
 time, by the way.

377
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,250
Yeah, sure.

378
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,030
No, really.

379
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,030
It was wonderful.

380
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,430
Yeah, I'm sure I'll
 cherish the memories

381
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,900
for the rest of my life.

382
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,480
We have recently received,
 as I'm sure most of you

383
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,900
have already heard, a
 visitor from another planet.

384
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,820
Now we here in Pucker
 Bush like to think

385
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,650
of ourselves as hospitable
 and generous folk.

386
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,960
But sometimes this
 could be a bad thing.

387
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,500
You see, this
 visitor, the first man

388
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,560
to set foot in our
 community in over 20 years,

389
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,840
has taken this
 hospitality and thrown

390
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,070
it right back into our faces.

391
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:10,060
Hey, I throw hospitality
 in anybody's face.

392
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,680
Settle down, Commander Rogers.

393
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,910
After all, you're on trial.

394
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,650
Yeah, how could I forget?

395
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,620
Now as I was
 saying, our kindness

396
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,320
was rewarded by
 this man's wanton

397
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,620
and malicious acts of
 violence against our law

398
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,360
abiding townsfolk.

399
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,890
You're making me sound
 like Hannibal Lecter,

400
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,030
for Christ's sake.

401
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,660
The defendant is therefore
 charged with intent

402
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:35,200
to commit violence,
 reckless endangerment,

403
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,330
propositioning an
 officer of the law.

404
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,250
Frontier justice.

405
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:47,170
Littering, excessive usage
 of derogatory female nicknames,

406
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:51,240
and crash landing on a
 planet without a permit.

407
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,840
Now, how does the defendant
 plead to these charges?

408
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,260
Insanity.

409
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:03,640
Well, since the defendant
 has decided to be a smart ass,

410
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,830
I'll leave his
 fate in your hands.

411
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,920
WOMAN: Hang him high.

412
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,110
Wait a minute.

413
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,510
Just wait a minute.

414
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,710
Yes, Lily.

415
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,380
Maybe we should let
 the man tell his side,

416
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,330
you know, just to
 make things fair.

417
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,590
Fair?

418
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,690
Just because he's a man
 doesn't mean he shouldn't

419
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,480
be treated like a woman, right?

420
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,910
I mean, he can't help it
 if he's kind of stupid

421
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:29,560
and doesn't take other people
 into consideration, can he?

422
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,690
Thanks for your help.

423
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,980
Very well then.

424
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,620
Go ahead and tell your side.

425
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,680
And make it quick.

426
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,330
Hi.

427
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,030
Hi.

428
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,450
My name's Steve.

429
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,070
And I'm a Capricorn.

430
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,290
My favorite color is aquamarine.

431
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,750
And my turn offs are Jerry
 Lewis movies and guys who

432
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,870
wear sandals with black socks.

433
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,540
[CLEARING THROAT] I believe
 you had a point to make.

434
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,660
Right, a point.

435
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:07,300
Well, the point
 is, uh, so you see,

436
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,630
I was flying this rocket
 full of sick children

437
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,300
to a hospital on the
 other side of the galaxy.

438
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,890
Excuse me, commander.

439
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:18,310
But I don't believe I saw any
 sick children when I found you.

440
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,260
I did, however,
 see a sign painted

441
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,720
on the side of your strange
 metal carriage, though.

442
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,080
It read Joe's Intergalactic
 Garbage Service.

443
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,840
OK, fine.

444
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,540
Fine!

445
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,540
So I'm a garbage man.

446
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,040
So what?

447
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,230
So you broads are--

448
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,750
women-- you women are going
 to send me up the river

449
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,120
just because I have a lousy job?

450
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,230
Look.

451
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,130
You see, this isn't an easy
 thing for me to deal with.

452
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,870
I'm a million miles
 away from home.

453
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,730
I'm all alone on a strange
 planet, just like ET.

454
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,900
Did you see that movie?

455
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,540
I mean, that was
 pretty sad, huh?

456
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,180
Look, you girls are
 going to have do what you

457
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,290
feel is the right thing to do.

458
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:05,420
But all I got to say is that
 I'm really sorry for what I did.

459
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,890
And if you let me go, I promise
 that I'll get out of here just

460
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:12,620
as soon as I can get a ride.

461
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,800
Well, I guess that's
 all I have to say.

462
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,880
Well, now that the
 defendant has had his say,

463
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,530
how do the citizens
 of Pucker Bush decide?

464
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,140
CROWD: Guilty!

465
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,430
Guilty?

466
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,140
Guilty?

467
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:26,840
What?

468
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,640
I just put up my heart to you
 people, and you call me guilty?

469
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,510
Oh, and they call
 us insensitive.

470
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:36,170
I'm afraid the townspeople's
 decision is final.

471
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,450
Oh, swell.

472
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,170
Now for your sentencing.

473
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,140
Look, could you at least get
 me drunk before you hang me?

474
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,840
I mean, I don't want
 to die a sober man.

475
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,220
The defendant is
 hereby fined $40

476
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,350
and will be issued
 a written citation

477
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:55,880
by Sheriff Parker for his
 crimes against this town.

478
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,380
What?

479
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,130
You mean you're not
 going to hang me?

480
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,410
Hang you?

481
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,910
We don't hang people here.

482
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,680
We just have trials here because
 the acoustics are so good.

483
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,810
Don't tell me you
 actually thought

484
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,300
we were going to hang you?

485
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,440
Yeah, what a stupid idea.

486
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:22,920
DELIA: It's starting.

487
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,960
SARAH: What do you mean?

488
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,260
DELIA: Well, can't you tell?

489
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,660
The women already can't
 keep their eyes off of him.

490
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,750
Next thing you know, they're
 going to be buying him flowers.

491
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,050
And then they're
 going to start writing

492
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,430
his name over and
 over again, putting

493
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,230
little hearts over the I's.

494
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:37,150
I don't think there's any
 I's in Steve Rogers, Delia.

495
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,330
My point is, is that these
 women were just babies when

496
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,080
the mining accident happened.

497
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,900

 men can be like.

Oh, and you do?

Maybe Earth men are different.

501
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,790
And who better
 to know than you?

502
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,690
You certainly seem awful
 eager to fly off, don't you?

503
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,020
Yeah.

504
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,370
Just imagine if
 you were stranded

505
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,890
on a planet full of guys.

506
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,930
Oh, my.

Yeah, it sounds great.

But it's no picnic, believe me.

00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,460

 to take a lot of vitamins,

00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,390

 to have any around?

 our communication gear

515
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,110
was in the mineshaft
 when it collapsed.

 asked for a shovel.

Nobody told you to crash
 land on this here planet.

 a planet with a freaking Radio

00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,650
Maybe I should have!

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,730
you owe me 40 bucks.

What are you doing?

541
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,500
Oh, I thought you might
 need a towel or something.

542
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,320
No, I mean that thing

544
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,130
I'm trying not to look at you.

545
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:49,940
Why?

546
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,630
Well, it's
 customary, ain't it?

547
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,930
You ain't supposed to
 look at somebody's, um,

 me, but now you're worried

 ups about men, that's all.

 be proven wrong.

 help you with that.

STEVE: So what is
 this place anyway?

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,400
Well, 20 years ago
 when the mine collapsed,

00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,650
the women locked all the
 men's belongings here

585
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,440
in this building.

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,090
It must have cost you

00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,930

00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,990

 clothes or not?

 something out here.

This is the same
 jacket that they used

 who would probably go naked

 wore this stuff, huh?

 trapped in a mine shaft.

What can I do you for?

717
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,040
Milk.

718
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,450
CROWD: Milk?

719
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:24,200
Well, I don't hold
 my liquor too well.

720
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,490
You see, there was
 this one time when

721
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,260
I was on star base MK Naomi.

722
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,820
I was doing tequila shooters
 with some Jolt cola.

723
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,230
I guess we don't have to
 get into that right now.

724
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:45,030
So what do you ladies
 do on your time off?

725
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,040
LILY: This is about it.

726
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,670
Jeez, Lily.

727
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:52,090
This is pretty tame for the
 so-called wild frontier.

[COUGHS]

729
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,170
What was in that?

730
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:10,030
About 80 proof, fly boy.

731
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,870
I think my tongue
 is going numb.

732
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,010
Oh, space man.

733
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:30,230
Oh, yeah, it's time
 to rock and roll.

734
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:34,210
[MUSIC PLAYING]

735
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,690
Work it, boy!

736
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:46,060
Yeah hoo hoo!

737
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:46,920
Hey!

738
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,830
I just said yahoo
 in a public place.

739
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:49,680
Why would I do that?

740
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,080
Woo!

741
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,540
Hey, I kind of
 liked that shirt.

742
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,930
Well, I kind of happen to
 like you without that shirt,

743
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:09,140
you big, hunky,
 messy primate you.

744
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,360
I like him without his
 pants on better, so there.

745
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,710
Why don't you just keep
 your hands where they belong,

746
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,050
you dime store
 [INAUDIBLE] want to be?

747
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:18,960
My goodness, Delia, we're
 getting our panties in a bunch.

748
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,520
I'm getting real
 dizzy here, folks.

749
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,780
I ought to fire you.

750
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,530
Well, it's too late
 because I was voted in.

751
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,110
Fine, I'll impeach you then.

752
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,310
Can't we all just get along?

753
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,860

754
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,800
I'm warning you, Delia.

755
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,630
They don't call me
 Snake Eyes for nothing.

756
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,420
It could be a birth defect.

757
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,200
If you want defect,
 I'll show you defect.

758
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,190
Hey, I know you.

759
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:45,540
We've got to get you
 sobered up, space man.

760
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,890
Do you see where
 this is leading, Sarah?

761
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,640
Do you see what happens
 when there's a man around?

762
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,220
All I see is some drunk
 jealous bitch who can't

stand to have any competition.

00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,710
Somebody get me my gun.

765
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,410
Take it outside.

766
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:10,010
Space man, how's your head?

767
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:13,410
Well, I can finally
 see in color again.

768
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:16,990
It was the dancing,
 that's what did it.

769
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:17,860
I danced?

770
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,480
Really?

771
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,700
Was I any good?

772
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,970
Best you don't know about it.

00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,740
Please tell me I didn't
 do the robot again.

00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,380

776
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,990
I love to watch them.

777
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,950
Any particular reason?

778
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,800
You don't always
 have to have a reason

779
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,710
to like something, space boy.

780
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:58,400
Sometimes it just kind
 of happens that way.

781
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,930
Look, my name's not space boy.

782
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:04,370
And it's not space man,
 and it's not Earth man.

783
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:07,590
And it definitely isn't
 male chauvinist pig's ass.

784
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,910
Who called you that?

785
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:09,940
I didn't.

786
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:13,430
Well, my mom did once,
 but that's not the point.

787
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:17,700
See, the point is my
 name's Steve Rogers.

788
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,460
You can call me Steve.

789
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,390
Or yeah, you can even
 call me Mr. Rogers,

790
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:24,820
but call me by my
 name, my real name.

791
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,160
OK.

792
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:27,860
Oh, hey.

793
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:35,950
I found this behind the bar.

794

Oh, my God, I can't believe
 you found six-fingered

 know how to play that.

Well, no, but.

00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,450
Not even one song?

800
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,690
Well, I know one song.

801
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:53,030
I mean, not all of it,
 just-- just parts of it.

802
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,570
Well, go ahead.

803
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:55,270
Really?

804
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,020
You sure?

805
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,320
OK?

00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:12,640
Well, give me a home
 where the buffalo roam

809
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,110
and the deer and
 the antelope play.

And seldom is heard a
 bah bah blah blah blah.

811
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,870
Did you make that up?

812
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:34,390
I made up that
 blah blah blah part.

813
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,870
I like your dancing better.

814
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:41,560
Can I ask you a question, Steve?

815
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,570
Sure, go ahead.

816
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:47,830
When you leave here, are
 you going to remember me?

817
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:51,380
Of course I'm going
 to remember you.

818
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,150
Do you think you'll
 ever come back and visit?

819
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,270
Well, honestly, I don't know.

I mean, it would be nice
 and everything, but I--

821
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:07,880
There's other places
 you'd rather be.

822
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,650
I never really
 thought of it that way.

823
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:13,810
Maybe other women, too.

824
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,650
I really don't
 know what I want.

00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:25,100

Well, I guess this
 is good night then.

00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,330
Yeah, I guess so.

 really want to.

Mm-hmm.

What you got under that sheet?

00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:56,770
Uh, chaps?

You know, Commander
 Roger, you have needs.

00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,580
I have needs.

864
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,090
Why can't we just
 meet on common ground?

865
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:10,790
I don't know.

866
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:13,880
Do you like reruns of
 Welcome Back, Carter?

867
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,820
I was thinking of something
 a little more immediate.

868
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:19,310
OK, how about
 reruns of [INAUDIBLE]..

869
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:21,830
You don't want to get involved
 with Sheriff Parker, do you?

870
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:24,440
I mean, she's nice and
 all, but those handcuffs,

871
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,860
doesn't that strike you
 as just a little bit odd?

872
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,720
You'd be much wiser
 if you were to get

873
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:30,890
involved with
 somebody who's just

874
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:33,470
a little more straightforward.

875
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:36,390
Well, I'm really not looking
 for a commitment right now.

876
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:40,710
Men, what do I have to
 do to get your attention?

877
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:41,770

 because I don't like it much.

884
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,580
I was just thinking
 that, you know,

885
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:57,270
if I try to come onto you, then
 you'd probably turn me down.

886
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:04,420
But I'm thinking maybe
 we should try anyway.

887
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,470
What's going on in here?

888
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:08,470
Well, first of all, I was
 just trying to get some sleep.

889
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:10,280
Oh, yeah, why don't
 you try telling that

to all them sick
 children you were trying

891
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:13,630
to take across the galaxy?

892
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:15,800
There really is a good
 explanation for all this.

Oh, slave boy?

896
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:22,960
I wore those handcuffs
 exactly one time.

897
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,730
That doesn't make
 me a slave boy.

899
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,000
I was here first, gals.

900
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,800
I'm the one that found
 him in the prairie.

901
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,570
He's mine, end of story.

902
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:33,400
Well, why didn't you
 just cut out the middle man

903
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,470
and brand him on
 the S, snake lips?

904
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:36,210
You guys!

905
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,690
Why don't you just find
 somebody else, Delia?

906
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:38,650
He's mine.
 - Why?

907
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:40,900
So you could dazzle him with
 your extensive collection

908
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,700

909
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,480
You guys.

910
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,770
What do you want?

911
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:47,410
You're treating him
 like a side of potatoes.

912
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:48,610
So what's the problem?

913
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:51,410
Well, he's a
 sensitive human being.

914
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:52,850
He has feelings.

915
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:53,820
Yeah, that's right.

916
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:57,490
Yeah, most of which
 are located in his groin.

917
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:58,750
How would you know?

00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:01,960

 doing a Frigidaire on PMS.

 worse, she's the mayor.

00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,530

 up for re-election.

 someplace else tonight.

I know I'm a good looking
 guy and everything,

but I'm just not worth all this.

952

Of course you're
 not worth this.

 load this damn thing.

00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:51,310
I guess I did, too.

00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:53,350
I must have been
 so mad I forgot.

964
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:54,050
Mad?

00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:56,390

Look, I really
 need to talk to you.

About what?

00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:32,950
About last night
 and about tomorrow.

00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:36,660
I don't understand you.

 that without a positronic

 here for the rest of my life.

So which one are
 you going to choose?

980
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:51,270
You mean Parker or the mayor?

981
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:54,400
You're going to choose one
 of the two of them, aren't you?

982
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,200
I don't want them.

983
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,900
I want somebody else.

984
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,230
Oh, really?

985
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:05,710
I want someone like you.

986
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:06,410
Good luck.

987
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:12,610
Oh, you mean me.

988
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:14,480
I knew it.

989
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,640
I knew you'd eventually come
 to your stupid male senses.

990
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,740
Well, I don't
 know anybody else

991
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,940

 on this backwards planet

with for the rest of my life.

993
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:25,840
Well, you realize, of course,
 that means I'm going to have

00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,240
to keep wishing on them stars.

995
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,630
Just make sure I'm
 not driving it, OK?

996
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:40,900
You even squawked
 around like a chicken.

997
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:41,610
Oh, God.

998
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,870
I'm really going to miss
 Earth, you know that.

999
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:53,920
Or maybe just a little bit.

1000
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,770
You don't have to, you know.

1001
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,710
I don't think I'm ever
 going to be able to go back.

1002
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:05,490
I mean, I can't get
 in touch with anyone.

1003
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:09,040
And Pucker Bush isn't on any
 of the astrologers' charts.

1004
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,260

 there'd probably

00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,580

Well, my dad gave it to me.

 from a gumball machine.
