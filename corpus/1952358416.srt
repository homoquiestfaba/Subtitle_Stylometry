1
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:32,890
It's time now.

2
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,170
You have to look beautiful
for your funeral,

3
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,536
as if you were still alive,

4
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:43,337
just sleeping.

5
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:47,312
This is how they're all
going to remember you.

6
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,613
What's wrong?

7
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,617
Nothing.

8
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,121
You used to enjoy it.

9
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,335
Baby, I'm sorry.

10
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,802
Fuck. Fuck!

11
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,978
Anna, what's wrong?

12
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,643
Man:
It just... it feels like...

13
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,017
it feels like
you're somewhere else.

14
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:13,087
Is it about us?
Is that what it is?

15
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:16,357
It's not about us.

16
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,956
What is it
do you think, huh?

17
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,100
I don't know.

18
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,504
Listen,

19
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,668
I just want us
to be happy again.

20
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,537
Are you happy?

21
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,214
I'm happy.

22
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,447
Anna, I love you so much.

23
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,045
Boy: Hey, Jack.

24
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,144
Didn't you hear me, jackoff?

25
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:18,089
You deaf, jackoff?
Can't fucking speak either?

26
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,489
- Say something!
- Hey.

27
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,653
What's going on here?

28
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:25,129
- Nothing, Ms. Taylor.
- Nothing?

29
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:27,598
It doesn't look like nothing.

30
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,569
You boys get back to class.

31
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,833
Now!
Back to class.

32
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,370
Jack, you okay?

33
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,146
- I think it's dead.
- Which one?

34
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,915
That guy? No.

35
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,256
Poor thing.
He's just scared.

36
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,387
See?

37
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,875
Jordan, are you guys
picking up George Shore?

38
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,817
George is...

39
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,191
Hello?

40
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,323
Is somebody there?

41
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,464
- Jack?
- Did I scare you, Mr. Taylor?

42
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,067
No, um...

43
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,202
it's locked.

44
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,121
Anna:
Shouldn't you be home?

45
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,487
My mom's picking me up.

46
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,220
Okay, well, I've gotta run.

47
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,423
- Where are you going?
- To a funeral.

48
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,125
- My old piano teacher.
- Can I come?

49
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,134
No, Jack.

50
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,604
A funeral's a very...
a very private affair.

51
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,232
I've never been
to a funeral before.

52
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,606
It wouldn't be appropriate.

53
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,668
Anyway,
wouldn't your mother worry?

54
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,680
- Not really.
- I'm sure she would.

55
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,879
Have a wonderful day, okay?

56
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,510
I'll see you in class tomorrow.

57
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,180
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

58
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:30,006
Man: We have entrusted our brother
James Hutton to God's mercy

59
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:33,842
in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection...

60
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:01,434
White roses...
they were his favorite.

61
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,068
How did you know?

62
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,101
They just seemed
appropriate somehow.

63
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,744
Mrs. Hutton, I'm so sorry.

64
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:17,551
Thank you, Anna.

65
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,319
You look tired, dear.

66
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:22,657
No no, I'm fine.

67
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,686
Everything's fine.

68
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:01,258
- I'm so sorry.
- You scared the life out of me.

69
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,124
I'm sorry.

70
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,097
Oh! Your hair.

71
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,498
- Do you not like it?
- No, I didn't say that.

72
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,092
It's just very...

73
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,036
it's very red.

74
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,561
Not really you, is it?

75
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:17,132
- Are you ready to order?
- Yes.

76
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,939
We'll have the duck, please.

77
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,912
- Paul.
- You always have the duck here.

78
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,278
I don't always have the duck.

79
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,916
- I'll have the duck.
- Yes, ma'am.

80
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:31,218
The duck's very good.

81
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:34,158
Listen, let's...

82
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,684
come here.

83
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,492
Let's try not to fight
tonight, okay?

84
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,624
- Okay.
- Okay.

85
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,062
What are we drinking?

86
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,503
Oh yes, all right.

87
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,167
It's good.

88
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:53,144
And it has a very
expensive-looking label.

89
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,874
What's the special occasion?

90
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,382
There's something I really
need to talk to you about.

91
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,544
About us. I've been offered
a transfer to head office

92
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,054
in Chicago.
It's gonna mean a lot more work,

93
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,149
of course a lot of responsibility
and a lot of changes,

94
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,889
but it's an incredible opportunity
and I'd be crazy to turn it down.

95
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,523
So I'm thinking maybe

96
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,123
it's time for us to...

97
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,225
- You're leaving me.
- What?

98
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:19,260
You could have told me this morning.
You didn't have to buy me off

99
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,603
- with this expensive dinner.
- Anna, wait.

100
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,232
- No.
- You told me everything

101
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,573
- was gonna be okay.
- Don't be ridiculous.

102
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,478
- Anna, you've got it all wrong.
- I'm not being ridiculous.

103
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:31,176
Jesus Christ, can we get through
one meal without arguing?

104
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:32,844
- No. No.
- Please, just one meal!

105
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,080
Apparently we can't.
Apparently I'm not capable of that.

106
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,884
Maybe you aren't.
I'm beginning to wonder.

107
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,913
- Fuck you.
- Please, everyone's watching.

108
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,722
- Don't do this.
- Fuck you!

109
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,355
You're... you're crazy.
You're just like your goddamn mother.

110
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:47,229
I am nothing like my mother.

111
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,427
You know,
I'm not running after you, Anna.

112
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,197
Good!

113
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,001
Shit.

114
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,107
Fuck.

115
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,875
Anna, Anna!

116
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,440
Anna, come on.
Please open the door.

117
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,714
I don't want to hear it.

118
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,584
I want you to come.
I want you to come to...

119
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,614
Don't do this.
Anna! Hey hey hey.

120
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:15,650
Anna, I want you to come to...
I want you to come to Chicago.

121
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:18,458
Anna, Anna... God damn it!

122
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,488
Please don't go.

123
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,933
Shit.

124
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,698
Oh, Anna.

125
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,249
Fucking asshole.

126
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,026
Are we having

127
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:54,294
Are we having fun?

128
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,665
Are we
having fun?

129
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,264
Fun

130
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,775
Are we having fun?

131
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,768
Are we
having fun?

132
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,771
Shit!

133
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,841
Where am I?

134
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:32,449
You're in a funeral home.
You're dead.

135
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,954
You were in a car accident.

136
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,328
Shit.

137
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,633
You hit a truck loaded
with metal pipes.

138
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,471
I'm not dead.

139
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,672
You were pronounced dead
eight hours ago.

140
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:58,149
Your blood no longer circulates
through your body.

141
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,277
Your brain cells are slowly dying.

142
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,550
Your body's already decomposing.

143
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,817
I'm not dead.

144
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,262
This is your death certificate.

145
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,570
Cause of death,
massive internal trauma.

146
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,339
Time of death: 8:23 p. m.

147
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,745
You were dead on arrival.
The attendant physician signed here

148
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,114
at 9:45 last night.

149
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,353
I'm sorry.

150
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:43,354
What's happening?
Why can't I move?

151
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:51,334
Don't touch me.
Why are you touching me?

152
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,134
I'm preparing your body.

153
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,698
You have to look beautiful
for your funeral.

154
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,142
But I'm not dead.

155
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,975
You all say the same thing.

156
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,382
Maybe you should rest now.

157
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,422
Oh my God.

158
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:21,661
I can't be dead.
I can't be dead.

159
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,066
This must be a nightmare.

160
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,230
Oh, God, wake up.

161
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,535
Wake up.

162
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,408
Wake up. Wake up!

163
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,081
Anna.

164
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,257
Baby, you've got it wrong.
I want you to come to Chicago.

165
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,987
I want you to come.

166
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,060
Okay, we've gotta talk.

167
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,429
I'm gonna come by your place
before I go to the office

168
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,434
and everything's going to be fine.

169
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:34,999
I promise.
Call me when you get this.

170
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,106
I love you so much.

171
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,973
Okay, I'll see you soon.

172
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,191
- The shell grows...
- Hi, I'm...

173
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,696
looking for Anna Taylor.

174
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,925
I'm sorry,
you can't just come in here.

175
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,491
I'm Anna's fiancé
Paul Coleman.

176
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,969
This is her room, right?

177
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,631
She didn't come in today.

178
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,005
Did she call in sick?

179
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,942
She didn't call in at all.

180
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,879
Okay, yeah, thanks.
Sorry. Thank you.

181
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,282
Funeral director:
She's a schoolteacher.

182
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:28,691
I know. It's always so difficult
when they're so young.

183
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,794
That's right, you knew her.
She was at your funeral.

184
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,296
She's in good hands now.

185
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:05,626
Paul: Oh, hi, Diane.

186
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,861
- Is Anna home?
- I think you'd better come in.

187
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,027
What's wrong?

188
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,663
What happened?
Where is Anna?

189
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:18,502
Anna was in
a car accident last night.

190
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,238
My daughter's dead.

191
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,145
That's what's happened.

192
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,475
Car accident?

193
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,886
When? What...
what are you talking about?

194
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,947
I don't know.

195
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:35,687
They said it happened
just before 8:30.

196
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,530
We were at...

197
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,361
no, we were at a restaurant.

198
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,766
You shouldn't have let her
drive in that weather.

199
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,828
She can't be dead.

200
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,634
There must be some mistake.

201
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:55,037
There's no mistake.

202
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,449
And flowers... how appropriate.

203
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,454
What?

204
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,286
Why wouldn't you call me?

205
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,320
You took her away from me.

206
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:15,856
I don't want you
anywhere near her.

207
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,145
Anna:
Please don't hurt me.

208
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,450
How could I hurt you?
You're already dead.

209
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,422
I can't be dead.

210
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,516
Then why are you here?

211
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:46,357
Just let me go.

212
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:50,528
Please please.
I won't tell anyone. I promise.

213
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:53,834
You're still in denial.

214
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,669
You have to trust me.

215
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,506
I'm only here to help you.

216
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,018
What's happening?

217
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,829
Why can't I feel anything?

218
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,044
Why are you keeping me here?

219
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,655
- What are you doing?
- Shh shh shh.

220
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:55,165
Don't be scared.
This will relax your muscles.

221
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,566
Stop the rigor mortis setting in.

222
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,106
So I can work on your body.

223
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,513
Your mother's early.

224
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,785
Funeral director:
I'm so very sorry, Mrs. Taylor.

225
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:20,917
It's always so tragic
when one loses a child.

226
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,621
If you'd care to come to my office,
we can make arrangements.

227
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:26,358
- I want to see her.
- But she hasn't been prepared.

228
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,025
I don't care.
I want to see her.

229
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,966
Of course. This way.

230
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,589
Oh, forgive me.

231
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,387
As I said,

232
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:57,122
I've only just started
preparing her.

233
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,325
So sorry.

234
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:01,832
What's the point

235
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,995
of preserving the body
if the soul has already left?

236
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:08,005
No, the soul is still here.

237
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:12,409
It's we who suffer.

238
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:14,503
We who are left behind.

239
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,506
Who's going to take care
of me now?

240
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,677
Did you think about that?

241
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:28,258
I'll confirm the date
with Father Graham this afternoon:

242
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:29,817
Friday, as you requested.

243
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,189
Just do what you think is best.

244
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,425
It's just details.

245
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,975
Oh, there is one thing.

246
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,275
- Yes?
- Her hair.

247
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,304
She was a brunette.

248
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:52,339
I'd like it back to that color.

249
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,784
Of course.

250
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:25,105
Mom, you were supposed to pick
me up from school yesterday.

251
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:29,349
I waited.

252
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:31,685
Tv: I'll take a look at the clock,
see how many seconds you have

253
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,554
to find the two Easter eggs.
You have 30 seconds.

254
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,822
You understand the problem?
And of course the usual catch

255
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,794
is on "Beat the Clock" is
you can't use your hands.

256
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,319
You have to go after these
with your teeth.

257
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:47,026
I must be in shock.

258
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:49,693
I'm just in shock.
It's okay.

259
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:27,136
Father Graham,
thanks for calling back.

260
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:30,801
Yes, I'd like to confirm
the burial service for Friday.

261
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:35,438
The deceased is Anna Taylor.
T- A-Y-L-O-R.

262
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,108
Yes, she's downstairs.

263
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,387
Hello? Hello!

264
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,790
Let me out!

265
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,898
Let me out!

266
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,687
May I help you?

267
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:25,992
- Eliot Deacon?
- Yes.

268
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,998
Paul Coleman.

269
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:31,331
Of course, the lawyer.

270
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:34,666
It's a small town.

271
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:37,334
In my line of work you get
to know everyone eventually.

272
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:40,535
I'm Anna Taylor's fiancé.

273
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:44,537
That's strange. She wasn't
wearing an engagement ring.

274
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:48,581
Well, not quite fiancé.

275
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,611
Mr. Coleman,
I am so sorry for your loss.

276
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:52,520
- I'd like to see her.
- I'm afraid

277
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,388
the viewing isn't
until Thursday evening.

278
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,290
I need to see her right now,
please, if that's possible.

279
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,921
I'm sorry it's not possible.
You're not family.

280
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,363
- Please give me five minutes.
- I do understand, Mr. Cole...

281
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,765
You don't understand!
You don't understand.

282
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,963
Paul?

283
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:10,464
- Paul, Paul!
- Paul: It's my fault.

284
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:12,567
I'm down here.

285
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,579
Please,
please let me just see her.

286
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:18,582
There really is nothing I can do.
I'm so sorry.

287
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:21,380
Let me out!

288
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,621
Paul!

289
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:55,983
Who was that?

290
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:59,322
No one.

291
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,459
No one?

292
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:10,628
- It was Paul.
- I know.

293
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:13,569
I heard you talking to him.

294
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,969
Why wouldn't you
let him see me?

295
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,541
Did you love him?

296
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:26,106
That's none of your business.

297
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:29,517
You weren't gonna tell me
he was here, were you?

298
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,784
No.

299
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,757
- Why?
- Because it would only hurt you.

300
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:37,761
You have to let go of the living
just as they have to let go of you.

301
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:39,956
Anna:
I don't believe you.

302
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:42,523
Why are you doing this to me?

303
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,195
You're all the same.
You all blame me for your death

304
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,227
- as if it were my fault.
- No,

305
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:49,672
you drugged me so my mother...

306
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:52,471
Others, they just see you
as a dead body on the slab.

307
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,479
Only I can see you as you really are.

308
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,349
You're a lunatic.

309
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:02,251
You're crazy.

310
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:05,654
You're completely crazy.

311
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:10,494
I don't have time for this.
I'm a busy man.

312
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:16,259
Oh, I nearly forgot.
How tall are you?

313
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:18,599
Why?

314
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:21,537
I need to know your height
for your coffin.

315
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,376
Let's say 5'3" then.

316
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,847
Wait. No.

317
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:56,232
Mr. Coleman, I heard
about your girlfriend.

318
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:58,299
I'm sorry.

319
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:00,607
Is Tom in?

320
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,579
The captain just stepped out.
He won't be long.

321
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:04,240
You can wait in his office
if you want.

322
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:07,649
Um, no, thanks.
I'll just grab a drink.

323
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:22,355
Piece of shit.

324
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,708
Are you okay?

325
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:23,720
Yeah. No, I'm fine.

326
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:26,279
I'm fine.

327
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:35,930
I just found out.

328
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:39,403
I'm so sorry, man. Look,
if there's anything you need at all...

329
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:42,167
- I need to see Anna.
- What do you mean?

330
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:45,937
The funeral director said I couldn't
see her because I wasn't family.

331
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,605
Please talk to him, Tom.
You know, pull some strings

332
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,773
or show him your badge
or something.

333
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,373
I can't do that, Paul.

334
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,317
I fucked up, man.

335
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,157
Are you sure you're okay?

336
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:06,060
Huh? Yeah.

337
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:08,395
I always fuck everything up.

338
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:37,047
Oh God.

339
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,648
I don't want to die.

340
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:23,123
Who was she?

341
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:25,499
Mrs. Whitehall.

342
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:43,550
You shouldn't be afraid of her.

343
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:45,646
The dead can't harm the dead.

344
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,317
But I'm not dead!

345
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,093
Stay where you are.

346
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:55,758
Give me the scissors.

347
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,829
I only want to help you.

348
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:02,430
I'll kill you.
I swear to God I will kill you.

349
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,908
Go ahead.

350
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:23,724
Go on.

351
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,630
What are you waiting for?

352
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,536
Look,

353
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:38,337
I'm breathing.

354
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,709
I'm breathing.
Maybe I was in some kind of coma

355
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:45,079
- and the doctors made a mistake...
- You died, Anna.

356
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:46,981
Everyone dies.

357
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:50,111
How can I be dead
if I'm talking to you?

358
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:51,917
You're talking

359
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:54,789
not because you're alive,

360
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:57,953
but because I have a gift.

361
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:02,332
I can talk to those
between life and death.

362
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:04,357
Why?

363
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,839
To help them
make the transition.

364
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:12,001
So am I a ghost?
Is that why I'm here?

365
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:15,068
You're here so I can bury you.
Come.

366
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:17,080
No, please, I don't want...

367
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:19,582
You're a corpse, Anna.
Your opinion doesn't count anymore.

368
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:23,383
But I'm breathing.
I must still be alive.

369
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,116
Oh, you people!

370
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:28,751
You think because you breathe,
piss, shit you're alive?

371
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:32,388
You clutch onto life as if
your life was worth clutching onto.

372
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:37,028
Was your life worth
clutching onto, Anna? Was it?

373
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:40,298
Maybe you died a long time ago.

374
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:47,499
I'm surprised you're
still arguing with me.

375
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:49,843
You don't have much time left.

376
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:57,110
Your funeral's in two days.

377
00:40:57,154 --> 00:41:00,920
Soon you're going to be enclosed
in a coffin and buried in the ground.

378
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,188
No one can hear you then.

379
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:05,593
No one can speak to you there.

380
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:57,311
Are you scared?

381
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:27,002
You're not ready.

382
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,374
You're not ready.

383
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:29,236
...struggling,
you don't have much time left.

384
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,366
There's nothing.
He's right.

385
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:33,933
What have you done
with your life?

386
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:37,345
Maybe you did die
a long time ago.

387
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:40,578
Maybe you did
die a long time ago.

388
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:47,946
- I'm disappointed with you.
- Who are you?

389
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,620
I am you.

390
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:53,425
Maybe you are better off dead.

391
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,066
Paul!

392
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:45,642
Can I help you?

393
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,208
Then perhaps
you can help me.

394
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:50,083
Could you throw these
away for me, please?

395
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:09,505
There's no life left in them.
They belong in the garbage.

396
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:16,670
Did you know Mrs. Whitehall?

397
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,808
I thought this was
Ms. Taylor's funeral.

398
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,045
Ah, Ms. Taylor, no.

399
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:25,055
Her funeral is not until Friday.

400
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:27,250
Where is she now?

401
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,953
Um, she's downstairs.

402
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:31,483
Why?

403
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:33,962
Why? Because she's not ready.

404
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,294
Is the flower for her?

405
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:40,360
- She was my teacher.
- Aha.

406
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,669
- And you are?
- Jack.

407
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:48,809
Well, Jack, what did you think?

408
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:51,679
- About what?
- About Mrs. Whitehall's funeral.

409
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:53,876
You find it interesting?

410
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,578
It was okay, I guess.

411
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,916
I see.

412
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:02,790
Are all funerals the same?

413
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:05,260
No, Jack.

414
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,092
They're never the same.

415
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:09,326
Each one is special.

416
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:12,802
The dead always speak to us
in different ways.

417
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:16,163
What do you mean?

418
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:19,869
It was a pleasure
talking to you, Jack.

419
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:49,032
Why did you do this?

420
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:56,642
Why did you do this?!

421
00:46:58,615 --> 00:47:01,106
Is this the afterlife?

422
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:07,019
Because it feels more like hell.

423
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:20,261
Paul.

424
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:31,338
Paul...

425
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:59,469
Anna?

426
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:07,173
Paul: No.

427
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,316
Anna.

428
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,318
Anna.

429
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,262
No!

430
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,741
- What is that?
- It's your dress

431
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,718
- for your funeral.
- My funeral dress?

432
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:18,448
Your mother brought it
around this morning.

433
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,944
I'm not ready to die.
Not yet.

434
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:48,076
There's nothing
out there for you anymore.

435
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:56,255
I'll be back soon.

436
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,632
Oh, come on.

437
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:47,870
Shit!

438
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:58,317
Fuck.

439
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:04,683
One more key, come on.

440
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:13,092
20 dollar, four cents.

441
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:15,366
Thank you.

442
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:23,576
Sir, your change.

443
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,004
Oh.

444
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:25,554
Please be there.

445
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:35,928
Please be there.

446
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:43,037
Please pick up.
Please pick up.

447
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,783
Oh, come on,
answer the phone.

448
00:54:57,994 --> 00:55:00,758
Yeah?

449
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,527
I'm here. It's me.
Paul, I need you.

450
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:05,591
Hello?

451
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:09,594
Are you there?
Paul, help me.

452
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,800
- Paul.
- Please stop.

453
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:16,507
Oh...

454
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:20,580
I'm the only one
who can hear you now.

455
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:24,654
I'd be very careful
if I were you.

456
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:27,816
The dead have such a hold
over the living.

457
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:31,315
- What do you mean?
- He still feels your presence.

458
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:33,625
You're only causing him
more pain.

459
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:37,190
If you really loved him, you would
accept your death and let him go.

460
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:39,701
Then prove to me
that I'm really dead.

461
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:42,068
Oh, you people.

462
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:45,506
You always need proof.

463
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:54,613
Why do I
look like a corpse?

464
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:56,744
Because you are a corpse.

465
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,767
It's time you finally
accepted the truth.

466
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:15,270
You are dead.

467
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:17,170
You will never live again.

468
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,977
I am dead.

469
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:55,633
Bad dream?

470
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:57,867
I had the craziest dream.

471
00:57:57,907 --> 00:58:00,967
I dreamt that I was in a car crash
and I was dead.

472
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:05,037
Have you ever had a dream
where you were dead?

473
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:09,808
Paul?

474
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:16,391
- Paul?
- Shh shh shh.

475
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:18,656
What are you doing?

476
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:22,256
Keep your voice down.
You'll wake the neighbors.

477
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:25,233
You don't have any neighbors.

478
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:28,237
Did you ever love me?
Did you?

479
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:31,800
Say it.

480
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:34,639
Say you love me.

481
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:38,410
Are you gonna get that?

482
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:41,508
Me? No.
It's probably for Eliot.

483
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:50,090
Is it always like this?

484
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,990
- What do you mean?
- I thought that when you died

485
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,591
you wouldn't feel
any more pain.

486
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:01,633
You wouldn't have
to struggle anymore.

487
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:04,834
But it just never stops, does it?

488
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:14,950
I'll pick up the deceased
from the hospital.

489
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:19,013
Yes. This afternoon?

490
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,751
It'll be fine.

491
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:26,385
It's my pleasure, Mr. Miller.
Thank you.

492
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,566
I'll leave you
to sort out her things.

493
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:35,434
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay.

494
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:10,333
Okay.

495
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:12,068
Oh, wait, I want to take
a picture.

496
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:14,099
Okay, smile.

497
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:17,308
- Nice.
- Paul: Hey, I got this for you.

498
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:19,872
Aw, it's beautiful.

499
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:22,146
You're beautiful.

500
01:00:22,185 --> 01:00:23,948
I'll race you to the lake.

501
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:25,921
Oh, I'm not playing
your little games. No.

502
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,185
I'll make it worth your while.

503
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:31,424
Come on!

504
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:35,926
Anna: Uh-oh.

505
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:38,263
What are you doing?

506
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:40,269
- Don't let go of me.
- I won't.

507
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,531
I'll never let you go.

508
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,565
Anna:
What's that for?

509
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:23,901
His mouth... keep it closed.

510
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:47,960
Now the eyes.

511
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,609
Does he have family?

512
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:57,169
Yes. A brother.

513
01:01:57,213 --> 01:02:00,649
He's coming in later.

514
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:04,612
Did my mother cry
when she saw me?

515
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:09,719
I'm sorry.

516
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:14,494
Did Paul?

517
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:18,491
That's not important anymore.

518
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:21,628
I need to know.

519
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:27,503
We had an argument.

520
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:29,272
I tried to stop her.

521
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:31,940
No.

522
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:35,075
No, he didn't.

523
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:42,717
You should rest.

524
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:49,058
You're getting weaker.
It's almost time.

525
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:54,395
Can I ask you a question?

526
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,905
Yes, of course.

527
01:03:01,244 --> 01:03:03,041
Why do we die?

528
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:07,774
To make life important.

529
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:58,323
- Mr. Coleman?
- Yeah?

530
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:00,858
My name's Jack.

531
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:02,268
Hi. Hi, Jack.

532
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:04,170
How'd you know my name?

533
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:06,141
Ms. Taylor was my teacher.

534
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:08,473
I saw her last night.

535
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:10,342
What?

536
01:04:10,379 --> 01:04:12,847
I was going past the funeral home

537
01:04:12,882 --> 01:04:15,749
and...

538
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:17,844
Ms. Taylor stood there.

539
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:20,946
In the window.

540
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:22,821
Wearing a red dress.

541
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,327
Don't say things like that.
She doesn't even have a red dress.

542
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:27,022
- You think I'm lying?
- Look,

543
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:29,930
Jack, I'm not in the mood, okay?

544
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:32,434
- She needs your help.
- Anna's dead!

545
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:34,959
Your teacher is dead.

546
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:38,197
I can't help her anymore.

547
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:39,833
Maybe you just don't
love her anymore.

548
01:04:41,077 --> 01:04:43,272
- How dare you, you little fuck!
- Hey, whoa whoa whoa!

549
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:45,542
You think this is funny,
huh, you little weird shit?

550
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:48,345
Man: Stay there.

551
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:50,682
- Woman: Are you okay, honey?
- Man #2: What is wrong with him?

552
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,984
- Oh my God.
- Man: Come on, let's go.

553
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:56,685
Jack, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, kid.

554
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:59,194
I am so sorry.

555
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:21,139
Mrs. Whitehall...

556
01:05:22,785 --> 01:05:24,719
Susan.

557
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,881
I hope you found
what you were looking for.

558
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:31,993
I really enjoyed
our time together.

559
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:37,929
Huh?
Anthony, shh shh shh.

560
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:41,198
Anthony, always confused.

561
01:05:58,821 --> 01:06:00,288
How can I help you, Officer?

562
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:02,450
I'd like to see the body.

563
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:07,056
Frank Miller...
I'm his brother vincent Miller.

564
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:09,758
- I called this morning.
- Mr. Miller, of course.

565
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,165
Please, I'm so sorry
for your loss.

566
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:13,930
I hope it's no trouble.

567
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:16,370
I'd just kind of like
to see him before the funeral.

568
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:17,872
Yes yes, no trouble at all.

569
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:24,040
Your brother's here.

570
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,480
Ah.

571
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:31,411
You've done a beautiful job.
Thank you.

572
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:35,179
You should remember him
as he used to be.

573
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:39,490
That's the schoolteacher, isn't it?

574
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:42,520
Yes yes, very tragic.

575
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:51,567
Something's not right here.

576
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:55,105
Not right?

577
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:59,107
His smile.

578
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:02,413
Uh, it was a bit more...

579
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:03,816
smiley.

580
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,686
Smiley? Permit me.

581
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:12,917
Uh, a little more.

582
01:07:12,962 --> 01:07:15,954
That's it, yes, thank you.

583
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:18,831
We can fix that.
Glad to be of help.

584
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:21,860
Do you mind if I have a couple
of minutes alone with him?

585
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:25,665
No, not at all.

586
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,733
- I'll be outside.
- All right, thanks.

587
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:52,400
Oh.

588
01:07:56,439 --> 01:07:58,805
I'm sorry.

589
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:01,309
I, uh... I didn't...

590
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:06,112
I think I should go now.

591
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:08,639
I'll see you at the service?

592
01:08:08,684 --> 01:08:10,481
Thank... thank you.

593
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:18,792
I just told you.
That was your brother.

594
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:23,495
You had an accident.
You're dead.

595
01:08:23,532 --> 01:08:25,591
Why do you people
never listen to me?

596
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:31,998
No, it's not a gift.

597
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:34,601
It's a curse.

598
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:39,105
I take care of each of you
as if you were my children.

599
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:43,776
I wash the shit from your bodies.
I dress you.

600
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:46,083
I try everything to make you
look more beautiful

601
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,056
than when you were alive
and what do you do?

602
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:50,752
You argue with me
as if it was my fault you're dead,

603
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:51,953
as if I was to blame.

604
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:54,622
You're not talking to me now?
What?

605
01:08:54,663 --> 01:08:56,563
Hmm? What?

606
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:58,931
You don't want to?

607
01:08:59,935 --> 01:09:02,369
Eliot:
You don't talk because...

608
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:05,635
you have nothing to say.

609
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:09,742
And you have nothing to say

610
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:13,475
because you're a corpse.

611
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:15,108
Uh uh! No.

612
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:17,142
Now I don't want to talk
to you anymore.

613
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:32,229
I'm off to school.

614
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:38,765
Stop the clock.
You have 25 seconds left.

615
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:40,832
You had the right idea,
but let me give you one little tip.

616
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:09,035
What's it like?

617
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:10,936
Are you afraid?

618
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:13,441
Eliot: Jack.

619
01:10:15,678 --> 01:10:18,078
You have an empathy
with the dead.

620
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:23,885
You are drawn to them
just as they are drawn to you.

621
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:25,682
That's a rare gift.

622
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:28,019
I know you saw Anna.

623
01:10:30,993 --> 01:10:33,120
You're frightened by it, yes?

624
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:35,753
You shouldn't be afraid.

625
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:39,325
Christ had the same gift.

626
01:10:39,368 --> 01:10:41,427
He raised Lazarus

627
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:43,563
and spoke to the dead.

628
01:10:43,606 --> 01:10:46,074
You spoke to Ms. Taylor?

629
01:10:46,108 --> 01:10:48,008
Yes.

630
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:50,978
- You've spoken to others?
- Oh, yes, many others.

631
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:54,607
Who was the first one
you spoke to?

632
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:58,181
My mother.

633
01:11:00,889 --> 01:11:02,948
You shouldn't be afraid.

634
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:04,357
Other people...

635
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:06,418
they won't understand.

636
01:11:06,462 --> 01:11:08,362
They don't see what we see.

637
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:14,466
I can help you.

638
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:16,403
I can teach you.

639
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:51,203
Jack's voice: She was in the window,
wearing a red dress.

640
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:54,973
Anna, I'm sorry.

641
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:14,757
Deacon!

642
01:12:14,797 --> 01:12:17,925
Mr. Coleman, pleasure.

643
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:19,399
She's not dead, is she?

644
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:22,836
- Mr. Coleman?
- Someone saw her.

645
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:24,839
- I'm sorry?
- One of Anna's students

646
01:12:24,873 --> 01:12:27,273
saw her in the window.

647
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:30,005
Oh, you mean Jack.

648
01:12:32,414 --> 01:12:34,905
- You know him.
- Of course I know him.

649
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:37,248
He often comes around here.

650
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:39,811
He's an 11-year-old boy,
Mr. Coleman,

651
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:42,881
and like all young boys
has a vivid imagination.

652
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:45,655
- Now if you'll excuse me.
- I don't think he imagined it.

653
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:47,855
I think he really saw her.

654
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:51,258
With all due respect,

655
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,268
maybe you just want
to believe he saw her.

656
01:12:53,302 --> 01:12:54,701
Fuck you.

657
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:56,261
Anna!

658
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:57,636
Mr. Coleman.

659
01:12:57,673 --> 01:13:00,233
Paul: Anna!

660
01:13:04,346 --> 01:13:06,314
- Anna!
- Mr. Coleman.

661
01:13:06,348 --> 01:13:08,873
- I think you should leave.
- Anna!

662
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:11,708
Anna!

663
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:20,695
She's in here, isn't she?

664
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:29,201
Give me the fucking key, please.

665
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:30,865
Anna!

666
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:33,704
She's dead.
You need to let her go.

667
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:36,040
She's accepted her death

668
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:38,308
and now she's at peace.

669
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:45,182
Paul:
Please, Anna, I'm sorry.

670
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:48,287
I can't do it.

671
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:51,918
I can't live without you.

672
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:54,292
Anna!
Open the door, please.

673
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:57,628
Mr. Coleman, she's dead.

674
01:13:57,666 --> 01:14:01,193
I know what you're going through.
Denial's a natural part of grieving,

675
01:14:01,236 --> 01:14:03,033
but you have to accept she's gone.

676
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:05,869
- She needs my help.
- You can't help her anymore.

677
01:14:05,908 --> 01:14:08,342
Believe me.

678
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:15,145
Anna! Hey!

679
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:18,746
Give me the key.
Give me the fucking key.

680
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:20,584
Mr. Coleman, do you want
me to call the police?

681
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:27,457
I'll save you the trouble.

682
01:14:47,549 --> 01:14:49,483
I need you to issue
a search warrant.

683
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:53,044
I need a fucking search warrant, Tom.
You gonna help me out or not?

684
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:54,919
- Paul, sit down.
- Tom, I don't have time.

685
01:14:54,957 --> 01:14:57,391
Sit down.

686
01:14:58,594 --> 01:15:01,222
I just got a call
from Eliot Deacon.

687
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:03,697
Are you out of your fucking mind?

688
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:05,996
He won't let me see her.
He's keeping her. She's not dead.

689
01:15:06,034 --> 01:15:08,400
She was in a car accident, Paul.
Her car was wrecked, remember?

690
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:10,803
- It's downstairs.
- She's not dead.

691
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:13,399
Tom, she's not dead!

692
01:15:14,743 --> 01:15:17,211
Here's the coroner's report.

693
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:21,075
The paramedics phoned it in.

694
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:23,243
They only checked
for eye dilation and pulse.

695
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:26,277
The doctor signed the death certificate
without seeing the body.

696
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:28,516
- So?
- So there was no EEG, nothing.

697
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:30,752
- He could have drugged her and...
- Drugged her?

698
01:15:30,792 --> 01:15:32,316
- Yes!
- Cop: Actually, Chief,

699
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,556
um, there are drugs like that.

700
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:36,461
Yes.

701
01:15:36,498 --> 01:15:39,467
Hydronium bromide,
total paralysis within seconds,

702
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:41,469
heartbeat slows to almost nothing.

703
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:43,437
Thank you. Tom, listen,

704
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:45,497
the little kid Jack, he saw her.

705
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:48,601
I saw her.
She was on the slab dead.

706
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:50,703
- No no!
- I have seen dead bodies.

707
01:15:50,746 --> 01:15:53,306
- Believe me, she was definitely dead.
- No no no!

708
01:15:53,348 --> 01:15:56,806
Tom, listen, go down there.
Just check the place out.

709
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:59,787
On what grounds?
You have any evidence?

710
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:03,953
No.

711
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:05,425
But-but... no.

712
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:07,291
Do you have anything?

713
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:13,499
I think she may have called me.

714
01:16:13,535 --> 01:16:16,026
Called you?

715
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:18,767
Miller:
Collect or long distance?

716
01:16:18,807 --> 01:16:21,332
Fuck off!

717
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:24,442
Tom:
Let me get this straight,

718
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:28,506
first you hit a fucking kid,

719
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:31,041
then you attack Deacon,

720
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:34,112
and now you're telling me

721
01:16:34,156 --> 01:16:36,716
that your dead girlfriend

722
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:38,953
called you?

723
01:16:38,994 --> 01:16:42,054
You're losing it, pal.

724
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:44,657
You need to pull yourself
together here.

725
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,463
Okay?

726
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:49,063
Yeah.

727
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:52,130
You're gonna see her
tomorrow at the funeral.

728
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:54,540
And that will help.

729
01:16:54,576 --> 01:16:57,010
That'll give you closure.
It's what you need.

730
01:16:57,045 --> 01:16:59,275
You need to let go right now, Paul.

731
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:03,644
You just gotta let go.

732
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:13,424
Why do I have to get dressed?

733
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:16,363
Tomorrow's your funeral.

734
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:18,889
- Already?
- I told you,

735
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:21,596
you only had three days.

736
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:25,164
I told you to use your time well.

737
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:32,279
I have so many regrets.

738
01:17:34,783 --> 01:17:37,877
I have nothing but regrets.

739
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,854
I wanted a different life.

740
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:44,358
Then why didn't you do
something about it?

741
01:17:45,927 --> 01:17:47,918
I tried.

742
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:51,994
Nothing ever seemed to change.

743
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:56,304
I woke up every day.

744
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:59,000
I took a shower.

745
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:02,977
Drove in the same traffic to work.

746
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:05,138
Went home.

747
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,910
Went to sleep.

748
01:18:07,949 --> 01:18:11,009
Woke up again.

749
01:18:11,053 --> 01:18:13,613
Nothing was ever different.

750
01:18:13,655 --> 01:18:15,987
What did you really
want from life?

751
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:19,260
I wanted to be happy.

752
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:22,092
Happy. You all say
you wanted to be happy.

753
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:23,791
What does that mean?

754
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:26,096
Don't you understand
that's the whole point?

755
01:18:26,134 --> 01:18:28,329
L... I don't know.

756
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:30,065
Yes, you do.

757
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:32,539
You're just too scared
to admit it to yourself.

758
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:35,668
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

759
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:38,544
- I just want it to be over.
- What did you want from life?

760
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:40,548
I don't fucking know.

761
01:18:40,582 --> 01:18:41,981
Yes, you do. What did you want?

762
01:18:42,017 --> 01:18:44,611
- I wanted love.
- What did you want, Anna?

763
01:18:44,653 --> 01:18:46,848
I wanted love.

764
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:50,449
You had love.
Paul loved you.

765
01:18:52,094 --> 01:18:54,460
You don't understand.

766
01:18:54,496 --> 01:18:57,863
I wanted to love.

767
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:01,226
I was too scared.

768
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:05,468
My mother...

769
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:11,238
when I was little I learned that...

770
01:19:12,848 --> 01:19:15,373
loving someone
meant getting hurt.

771
01:19:19,354 --> 01:19:22,187
So I decided not to love anyone

772
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:24,158
so I'd never get hurt again.

773
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:30,193
I kept pushing Paul away.

774
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:33,601
He thought I didn't love him.

775
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:38,232
Did you?

776
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:41,367
He was the only one I loved.

777
01:19:45,413 --> 01:19:47,711
But I could never say it.

778
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:54,047
And then he stopped loving me.

779
01:19:59,161 --> 01:20:02,562
What would you do if you had
another chance?

780
01:20:05,867 --> 01:20:07,562
I don't know.

781
01:20:24,853 --> 01:20:27,913
Well?
Isn't this what you wanted?

782
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:14,221
Eliot:
I thought you were different.

783
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:17,322
You all say you're scared of death,

784
01:22:17,365 --> 01:22:21,699
but the truth is
you're more scared of life.

785
01:22:27,842 --> 01:22:31,005
I'm glad I'm dead.

786
01:22:33,815 --> 01:22:36,249
I'm glad it's over.

787
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:52,667
You said you could teach me.

788
01:22:59,774 --> 01:23:02,470
It's only a hole in the ground.

789
01:23:05,113 --> 01:23:07,047
- It's for...
- Ms. Taylor?

790
01:23:07,082 --> 01:23:09,073
Exactly. For Anna.

791
01:23:09,117 --> 01:23:12,280
- She belongs here.
- Because she's dead?

792
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:15,414
No, because there's no life
left in her.

793
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:18,824
- What do you mean?
- Don't you see?

794
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:22,660
I'm the only one that can see all these
corpses wandering around aimlessly.

795
01:23:24,532 --> 01:23:27,160
All they do is piss and shit,

796
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:30,000
suffocating us with their stench,

797
01:23:30,038 --> 01:23:33,030
doing nothing with their lives,

798
01:23:33,074 --> 01:23:36,976
taking the air away from those
that actually want to live.

799
01:23:38,947 --> 01:23:40,812
I have to bury them all.

800
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:45,881
I have no choice.

801
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:50,748
Now there's two of us.

802
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:28,859
It's time now.

803
01:24:32,767 --> 01:24:35,793
You have to look beautiful
for your funeral.

804
01:24:47,382 --> 01:24:50,545
This will relax your muscles.

805
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:52,644
Make your skin radiant,

806
01:24:52,687 --> 01:24:55,155
as if you were still alive.

807
01:24:57,058 --> 01:24:59,356
This is how they're all
going to remember you.

808
01:24:59,394 --> 01:25:01,555
Can I see myself one last time?

809
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:03,621
Hmm?

810
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:06,156
Can I see myself one last time?

811
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:10,597
Of course.

812
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:26,212
This is the end.

813
01:25:26,254 --> 01:25:28,279
The last part's the most difficult.

814
01:25:28,323 --> 01:25:31,156
You're going to have
to face it alone, but...

815
01:25:32,393 --> 01:25:34,486
you'll be at peace soon.

816
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:52,743
- You lied to me.
- Anna,

817
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:56,079
we've been through this before.
You're just imagining.

818
01:25:56,117 --> 01:25:58,608
- You lied to me.
- Anna, you're still

819
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:01,281
clutching onto life.

820
01:26:01,322 --> 01:26:03,756
Anna!

821
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:05,952
Don't give
into your fears now.

822
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:08,724
- Don't give into your fear.
- You lied to me.

823
01:26:08,763 --> 01:26:11,698
You're so-ooo close.

824
01:26:11,733 --> 01:26:13,997
Why did you lie to me?

825
01:26:14,035 --> 01:26:17,004
So close.

826
01:26:18,439 --> 01:26:20,669
That's it.

827
01:26:44,165 --> 01:26:45,826
Violets...

828
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:48,097
they were her favorite flower.

829
01:26:48,136 --> 01:26:51,128
How did you know?

830
01:26:51,172 --> 01:26:53,606
Violets seemed
appropriate somehow.

831
01:26:57,011 --> 01:26:59,206
Father Graham:
We have come here today

832
01:26:59,247 --> 01:27:02,045
to remember and to mourn
our Sister Anna

833
01:27:02,083 --> 01:27:04,210
and give thanks for her life.

834
01:27:08,523 --> 01:27:12,892
Dear God, as we stand here
in the silence of Thee today,

835
01:27:12,927 --> 01:27:15,054
to commit Anna to the ground

836
01:27:15,096 --> 01:27:17,462
and commit her spirit
into Your keeping

837
01:27:17,498 --> 01:27:20,399
and comfort one another
in our grief,

838
01:27:20,435 --> 01:27:22,460
in Your mercy...

839
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:28,375
I am the resurrection
and the life...

840
01:28:01,042 --> 01:28:02,839
What is it?

841
01:28:04,445 --> 01:28:06,174
She's so cold.

842
01:28:13,755 --> 01:28:15,586
I'm so sorry.

843
01:28:36,511 --> 01:28:39,844
Don't be scared.
It's better this way.

844
01:28:50,792 --> 01:28:52,919
She's at peace now.

845
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:09,942
You said she was alive.

846
01:29:09,977 --> 01:29:11,968
I never said she was alive.

847
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:13,878
I just said

848
01:29:13,915 --> 01:29:15,439
I saw her.

849
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:20,987
You need a ride?

850
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:24,052
Okay.

851
01:29:24,092 --> 01:29:26,583
I'll see ya.

852
01:29:26,627 --> 01:29:29,289
- Mr. Coleman?
- Yeah?

853
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:31,992
Don't forget
to fasten your seatbelt.

854
01:29:46,247 --> 01:29:47,407
Imagine, Anna,

855
01:29:47,482 --> 01:29:49,780
the whole world... your mother,

856
01:29:49,817 --> 01:29:52,115
your fiancé, your friends...

857
01:29:53,855 --> 01:29:56,289
everyone has buried you.

858
01:29:57,558 --> 01:30:00,493
They have placed a stone
above your body,

859
01:30:00,528 --> 01:30:02,996
and they've said their goodbyes

860
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:06,158
and gone back to their Tv dinners

861
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:08,168
and shopping malls thinking

862
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:10,636
that this is never
going to happen to them.

863
01:30:19,747 --> 01:30:22,307
- I'd give anything...
- They said I wasn't gonna...

864
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:25,683
- I'm not...
- I know I'm not dead.

865
01:30:32,493 --> 01:30:34,723
Think about it, Anna.

866
01:30:38,366 --> 01:30:41,164
Think about it
while you still can.

867
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:07,025
No.

868
01:31:09,664 --> 01:31:11,689
No no.

869
01:31:11,732 --> 01:31:14,064
No, I'm alive.

870
01:31:15,236 --> 01:31:17,431
God, no, help!

871
01:31:28,416 --> 01:31:29,883
Oh, shit.

872
01:31:32,086 --> 01:31:34,418
Don't you think
you've had enough to drink?

873
01:31:34,455 --> 01:31:35,717
Go to hell.

874
01:31:37,959 --> 01:31:39,392
Mr. Coleman, I think

875
01:31:39,427 --> 01:31:41,987
you should show
a little more respect.

876
01:31:42,029 --> 01:31:44,520
I know she wasn't dead.

877
01:31:47,802 --> 01:31:49,827
Wasn't she?

878
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:57,872
You have no idea what happens
when someone dies,

879
01:31:57,912 --> 01:32:00,005
what happens to their body,

880
01:32:00,047 --> 01:32:02,914
what happens
to their soul.

881
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:06,317
You think Anna was still alive
after the accident?

882
01:32:08,756 --> 01:32:11,452
Maybe you're right.

883
01:32:14,395 --> 01:32:17,023
Maybe she's still alive.

884
01:32:18,232 --> 01:32:20,700
Why don't you go
and find out for yourself,

885
01:32:20,735 --> 01:32:22,896
Mr. Coleman?

886
01:32:24,505 --> 01:32:26,097
Find out

887
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:28,734
whether she's dead

888
01:32:28,776 --> 01:32:30,903
or alive.

889
01:32:32,246 --> 01:32:35,215
You sick fuck!

890
01:32:35,249 --> 01:32:38,116
- Oh.
- You psychotic fuck.

891
01:32:38,152 --> 01:32:40,245
You don't have much time left.

892
01:32:40,288 --> 01:32:41,721
Woman:
What's he doing?

893
01:32:50,898 --> 01:32:53,696
Jack:
Don't be scared.

894
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:55,998
It's better this way.

895
01:33:14,455 --> 01:33:15,922
Let me out!

896
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:20,026
Come on.

897
01:33:21,362 --> 01:33:22,420
Paul!

898
01:33:32,406 --> 01:33:33,703
No.

899
01:34:23,624 --> 01:34:26,024
Is it over?

900
01:34:30,998 --> 01:34:33,728
Yes, Jack, it's over.

901
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:02,690
Okay.

902
01:35:02,730 --> 01:35:04,857
Anna?

903
01:35:04,899 --> 01:35:08,426
Okay, Anna.
Anna, I'm here.

904
01:35:08,469 --> 01:35:11,302
I'm here.

905
01:35:11,338 --> 01:35:13,203
Oh my God.

906
01:35:15,676 --> 01:35:17,576
Anna.

907
01:35:22,817 --> 01:35:24,751
Okay.

908
01:35:26,253 --> 01:35:28,744
Baby, please, please.

909
01:35:28,789 --> 01:35:32,350
Please.

910
01:35:34,095 --> 01:35:35,722
- Paul?
- Oh God.

911
01:35:35,763 --> 01:35:37,856
Baby. Thank God.

912
01:35:37,898 --> 01:35:39,297
- Paul?
- Yeah yeah.

913
01:35:39,333 --> 01:35:41,198
You came back for me?

914
01:35:41,235 --> 01:35:43,601
I did.
I came back for you.

915
01:35:43,637 --> 01:35:46,435
- You're safe now.
- I love you.

916
01:35:46,474 --> 01:35:48,374
I always loved you.

917
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:50,070
What's that noise?

918
01:35:50,111 --> 01:35:53,547
Anna's voice:
It's just the scissors for your clothes.

919
01:35:53,581 --> 01:35:56,448
Eliot just put them on the table.

920
01:36:07,228 --> 01:36:09,628
Where am I?

921
01:36:09,663 --> 01:36:11,597
You're in a funeral home.

922
01:36:11,632 --> 01:36:13,497
You're dead.

923
01:36:13,534 --> 01:36:15,559
I'm not dead.

924
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:19,198
You had a car accident.
You swerved off the road

925
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:21,606
and you hit a tree.

926
01:36:21,642 --> 01:36:23,269
I saw Anna.

927
01:36:23,310 --> 01:36:25,175
You buried her alive.

928
01:36:27,314 --> 01:36:30,010
You never made it
to the cemetery.

929
01:36:31,418 --> 01:36:33,511
And you never saw Anna.

930
01:36:35,589 --> 01:36:38,149
- You're dead.
- I'm not dead.

931
01:36:41,295 --> 01:36:43,058
You people,

932
01:36:43,097 --> 01:36:45,258
you all say the same thing.

933
01:36:47,668 --> 01:36:49,795
I'm not dead.

934
01:37:14,128 --> 01:37:16,392
Paul's voice:
I'm not dead.

935
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:19,058
Wake

936
01:37:19,099 --> 01:37:21,693
From your sleep

937
01:37:24,338 --> 01:37:27,705
You're drying off

938
01:37:27,741 --> 01:37:31,802
Your tears

939
01:37:31,846 --> 01:37:34,474
Today

940
01:37:35,616 --> 01:37:37,846
We escape

941
01:37:39,787 --> 01:37:43,484
We escape

942
01:37:48,329 --> 01:37:51,230
Pack

943
01:37:51,265 --> 01:37:53,995
And get dressed

944
01:37:55,936 --> 01:38:00,100
Before your father

945
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:03,439
Hears us

946
01:38:03,477 --> 01:38:06,571
Before

947
01:38:06,614 --> 01:38:09,583
All hell

948
01:38:09,617 --> 01:38:15,749
Breaks loose

949
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:24,493
Breathe

950
01:38:24,531 --> 01:38:27,864
Keep breathing

951
01:38:29,637 --> 01:38:33,471
Don't lose

952
01:38:34,675 --> 01:38:37,508
Your nerve

953
01:38:43,284 --> 01:38:47,186
Breathe

954
01:38:49,056 --> 01:38:52,025
Keep breathing

955
01:38:53,227 --> 01:38:56,754
I can't do this

956
01:38:58,565 --> 01:39:01,295
Alone

957
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:13,004
Sing

958
01:39:14,348 --> 01:39:17,283
Us a song

959
01:39:18,886 --> 01:39:22,322
A song to keep

960
01:39:22,356 --> 01:39:26,349
Us warm

961
01:39:26,393 --> 01:39:28,861
There's

962
01:39:29,863 --> 01:39:32,764
Such a chill

963
01:39:34,201 --> 01:39:38,570
Such a chill

964
01:39:42,977 --> 01:39:46,378
And you can

965
01:39:46,413 --> 01:39:48,904
Laugh

966
01:39:50,884 --> 01:39:56,982
A spineless laugh

967
01:39:58,892 --> 01:40:01,258
We hope

968
01:40:01,295 --> 01:40:05,061
Your rules

969
01:40:05,099 --> 01:40:10,002
And wisdom

970
01:40:10,037 --> 01:40:14,497
Choke you

971
01:40:14,541 --> 01:40:17,374
Now

972
01:40:17,411 --> 01:40:20,938
We are one

973
01:40:22,449 --> 01:40:26,283
In everlasting

974
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:30,120
Peace

975
01:40:30,157 --> 01:40:33,058
We hope

976
01:40:33,093 --> 01:40:35,857
That you choke

977
01:40:37,197 --> 01:40:41,429
That you choke

978
01:40:45,339 --> 01:40:47,864
We hope

979
01:40:48,876 --> 01:40:51,606
That you choke

980
01:40:52,946 --> 01:40:57,007
That you choke

981
01:41:00,954 --> 01:41:03,149
We hope

982
01:41:04,525 --> 01:41:07,153
That you choke

983
01:41:08,562 --> 01:41:12,965
That you choke.
