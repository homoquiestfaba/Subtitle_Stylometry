1
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,487
<i>Over the water and across the sea... </i>

2
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:58,148
<i>on a little island</i>
<i>off the Carolinas... </i>

3
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:02,057
<i>there once lived a young girl</i>
<i>with a great gift... </i>

4
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:05,097
<i>who thought she knew it all. </i>

5
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,631
<i>That's me. </i>

6
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:11,601
<i>Folks call me Marina, </i>
<i>and I'm a clairvoyant. </i>

7
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:18,644
<i>I've always known what people desire</i>
<i>long before they do... </i>

8
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,408
<i>and that's just a gift</i>
<i>I was born with. </i>

9
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:26,474
<i>Of course, I was always</i>
<i>on the watch for my other half... </i>

10
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,612
<i>what Grammy d'Arbo</i>
<i>calls your split-apart. </i>

11
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,550
<i>Mind you, I had my suitors... </i>

12
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:36,992
<i>but I was waiting for the signs</i>
<i>to let me know the right one... </i>

13
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,224
<i>a zigzag rainbow... </i>

14
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,994
<i>a bolt of lightning</i>
<i>ripping through the sky... </i>

15
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,037
<i>the usual things</i>
<i>that tell you love's at hand. </i>

16
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:59,809
<i>As the years went by, </i>
<i>I grew fevered with anticipation. </i>

17
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,387
<i>Grammy told me it was hormones. </i>

18
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,251
<i>But I knew love</i>
<i>had to be on its way... </i>

19
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:09,384
<i>and I could hardly wait</i>
<i>for my journey to begin. </i>

20
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,600
<i>First, a twin-tailed comet</i>
<i>crossed my path... </i>

21
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,008
<i>and I was sure</i>
<i>love could not be far behind. </i>

22
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,583
<i>Next thing I know, </i>
<i>a magical gift washed up on shore... </i>

23
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,659
<i>promising travel</i>
<i>to a faraway place. </i>

24
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:55,799
<i>And then thejumping mullet fish</i>
<i>yielded up a wedding band... </i>

25
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,810
<i>an undeniable sign that</i>
<i>I'd soon meet my mate. </i>

26
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:16,393
<i>And then one night, </i>
<i>I saw him in my dream. </i>

27
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,522
<i>Well, just part of him, actually... </i>

28
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,533
<i>but what a part. </i>

29
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:26,297
<i>It was a lustrous, glowing smile. </i>

30
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,670
<i>Grammy d'Arbo said you</i>
<i>can tell nothing from a smile... </i>

31
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,209
<i>unless, of course, you're a dentist. </i>

32
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:37,849
<i>Truth be told, I'd had</i>
<i>just about enough of her wisdom. </i>

33
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,815
<i>I knew what I had seen</i>
<i>in my dream... </i>

34
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,548
<i>the smile of my split-apart. </i>

35
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:48,655
<i>And he'd be coming over the water</i>
<i>and across the sea... </i>

36
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,991
<i>the man of my dreams. </i>

37
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,190
<i>My Adonis. </i>

38
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,527
<i>My Poseidon. </i>

39
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:58,126
<i>No. No, my Zeus. </i>

40
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,336
<i>Which is why I must admit</i>
<i>I was a mite surprised... </i>

41
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,713
<i>when the tides washed in</i>
<i>my husband-to-be Leo Lemke. </i>

42
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:19,218
<i>Grammy d'Arbo always said love</i>
<i>is the leap that won't be denied. </i>

43
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,392
<i>And what a leap I made... </i>

44
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:28,523
<i>from my little island to his. </i>

45
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,444
Kids, don't waste the water!

46
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,817
You little bastards!

47
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:24,048
I'll make sausage out of ya!

48
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,968
Ladies, could you help me, please?

49
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:19,439
Molly, Gina,
this is my bride, Marina Lemke.

50
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,604
Bride?

51
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:30,553
Welcome to the neighborhood.

52
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,418
Leo. You'll get a hernia.

53
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,628
Love's made a young man of me.

54
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,802
No peeking, now.
No peeking.

55
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,992
It's for wrapping the meat.

56
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,929
That's right! You always got to
wear an apron. Always.

57
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,603
And you'll be working here,
behind the counter.

58
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,899
- It's fragile.
- Sorry.

59
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,911
The most important
part of the business...

60
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,674
keeping the customer satisfied.

61
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,603
Oh, Leo, you're back.

62
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,304
Hey, Harper, you're holding me up?

63
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,313
Oh. This?

64
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:05,509
The writers decided that Harper's
gonna kill somebody next week.

65
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,813
Of course,
they haven't decided whom.

66
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,820
But I decided I'd start
working with the weapon...

67
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:13,085
so I'd be more in-the-moment
when it comes.

68
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:16,184
Honey, this is Robyn Graves.

69
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:19,423
She's Harper on <i>Our Daily Bread. </i>

70
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,692
- Big TV star.
- Well, hardly.

71
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,769
And this is Marina Lemke...

72
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,629
my wife.

73
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,104
Pleased to meet ya.

74
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,177
Your wife?

75
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,074
I mean, my God.
Congratulations.

76
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,708
That's wonderful.

77
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:40,911
Leo, you sneaky devil.

78
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,784
You didn't even tell me
you were seeing anybody.

79
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,914
So...

80
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,652
I was just showing Marina
around the shop.

81
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,251
- We're not really open.
- Oh, no, Leo.

82
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,263
You got to help me, please. Please?

83
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,292
I got some stuff
in the freezer if you want.

84
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:59,234
- Just something for the barbecue.
- Let me see what I can do ya.

85
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,909
So Leo married.

86
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,378
And you too. That's great.

87
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,610
- When did you two meet?
- Two days ago.

88
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,819
You're kidding.
Oh, that's so brave.

89
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,518
I mean, it's just
that it seems so sudden.

90
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,925
- How did you know he was the one?
- I dreamed about him.

91
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,798
Oh, God.

92
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,367
I wish I got some answers
when I'm asleep.

93
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:33,165
All I ever dream about
is being on stage naked...

94
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:37,299
which is so textbook I'm embarrassed
to tell my boyfriend about it.

95
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,435
- He's a shrink.
- Shrink?

96
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:42,207
Psychiatrist.
And I know that he wishes...

97
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:46,046
I had more complicated dreams, so...

98
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,746
I make 'em up sometimes.

99
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,014
Maybe I could borrow yours.

100
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:53,751
"Honey, I dreamed
I was at my wedding last night...

101
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,850
and you were the one.

102
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,361
The one and only."

103
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,759
How will I ever know for sure?

104
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,360
Oh, you'll know.

105
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,542
There's love waiting for you
behind a friendly face.

106
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,916
There'll be big changes...

107
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,614
and a nice surprise...

108
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,350
but don't be scared of it.

109
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,426
Just stand up to it.

110
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:30,461
Destiny has a way
of working itself out.

111
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,963
That's what Grandma
d'Arbo always says.

112
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:37,001
Then Alex is it.
I think you're right.

113
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:40,095
I think we've both been
just fooling ourselves...

114
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,264
with all this talk
about shared independence...

115
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,569
when basically at heart...

116
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,144
I am an old-fashioned girl.

117
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,145
- I could just die...
- Here you go, sweetheart.

118
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:51,910
A couple of London broils. You can
defrost them in the microwave.

119
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,918
Thanks, Leo.
You know, your wife...

120
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,080
Is something special, all right.

121
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,555
Robyn, we've been driving all day...

122
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,891
and this is our first night
home together.

123
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,157
We got to close up now.

124
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,260
Oh, God.
How insensitive of me.

125
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,166
Okay.

126
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,000
- Leo, what do I owe you?
- You can pay me next time.

127
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,599
- I don't got any change.
- Oh, hey.

128
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,770
Thank you. We'll talk?

129
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,974
Looking towards it.

130
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,983
- See you later.
- Bye.

131
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,747
Honey...

132
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,791
how come you told her
all that stuff?

133
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,295
Just thought she
might want to know.

134
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:08,453
Welcome back!
I hear congratulations are in order.

135
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,428
Hey, Doc!
Meet my new bride, Marina.

136
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,576
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

137
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,839
I was just careless.

138
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,608
Yeah.

139
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,317
- I hope you have enough space.
- Oh, plenty.

140
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:44,522
You know, I wasn't expecting
to bring home a new wife.

141
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,464
That thing's awful loud.

142
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:52,128
I got a brand-new
digital alarm clock from the bank.

143
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,535
Want me to put this
in the living room?

144
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:57,335
Oh, no. This clock's been
with my family since heaven started.

145
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:01,435
- It's a perpetual motion clock.
- There's no such thing.

146
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,515
Well, sure.

147
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,313
Grandma d'Arbo says those ticks
are the heartbeat of a marriage...

148
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,411
two hearts beating as one.

149
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,183
That's nice, honey.

150
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:16,754
Don't you go anywhere.

151
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:40,108
You can't beat Bessie.

152
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,481
Who's that?

153
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:44,852
Oh, Bessie Smith...

154
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,891
the empress of the blues.

155
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:52,327
- How come it sounds so scratchy?
- It's an original pressing.

156
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:53,830
Very rare.

157
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,878
No one's ever wanted me
to dance with them before.

158
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,914
- I can't believe that.
- Well, it's the truth.

159
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,393
This town is just
crackling with current.

160
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:25,588
I'm never going to get to sleep.

161
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,461
I was thinking...

162
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,763
maybe you could take me out
to meet some of the neighbors.

163
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,997
We got to get up early tomorrow.

164
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,732
We got a big delivery coming.

165
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,900
I think it's going
to be late arriving.

166
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,035
Something... Cracked axle.

167
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:45,512
- I'm getting good at this.
- You sure are.

168
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,518
So what do you say?

169
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:53,790
I say I'm one lucky butcher.

170
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,021
I'm sure glad I found you.

171
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,063
I found you.

172
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,778
I'm sorry. It's just,
you took me by surprise.

173
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:22,786
I thought our next decision
is living together, not marriage.

174
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,947
Where did this come from
all of a sudden?

175
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,493
The butcher's wife.

176
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,892
What?

177
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,464
Leo's wife.

178
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,965
I've been to a lot
of clairvoyants in my time...

179
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,161
and this one is the real thing.

180
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,262
She's a very wise woman.
I could tell.

181
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,341
Leo's married to a clairvoyant?

182
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,306
And she told me...

183
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:48,778
"Love is waiting for you
behind a friendly face.

184
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,008
Don't be scared of it.

185
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,050
You can stand up to it."

186
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,412
Where the hell did Leo meet a gypsy?

187
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,720
Alex, do you want to
get married or not?

188
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,726
- Before we answer that question...
- Oh, God.

189
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:05,194
Sit down.

190
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,561
If she's going to have
such a profound effect on us...

191
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,497
I'd like to know more about her.

192
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:12,297
- Could we get off her and on to us?
- I'm concerned.

193
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,963
No, curious. Yes.

194
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,042
If you're going to talk
about getting married...

195
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,977
why would you approach some
strange woman in a butcher shop?

196
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,844
Why wouldn't you just come to me?

197
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,316
Forget it! Just forget it!

198
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:30,616
I should've told you I dreamed it.
We'd be at the altar by now.

199
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,453
- Can we talk about this rationally?
- No.

200
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,959
Can you fight like a man
instead of a shrink?

201
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:40,395
All I am trying to say is that
marriage is an inspired decision.

202
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,709
And I told you I'm uncomfortable
with the term "shrink."

203
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,403
Shrink!

204
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,352
"We are all in the gutter...

205
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:54,296
but some of us are
looking at the stars."

206
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,328
Who'd have done that?

207
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,633
- It's beautiful.
- It's vandalism.

208
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:03,639
I could wash it off
for a couple of bucks.

209
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,972
Don't you want to
let it stay put?

210
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,545
What?

211
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,273
Well, what would it hurt?

212
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,084
We got some chores around the shop,
if you're handy with a broom.

213
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,119
- We do?
- Sure.

214
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,694
We've got that big delivery
arriving late this afternoon.

215
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,764
This morning.
Can I talk to you for a minute?

216
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:29,265
Excuse me.

217
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,359
I know this kid. He's trouble.

218
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,734
No, I don't see that.

219
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:37,535
Maybe a little misunderstood.
He could use a job.

220
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,576
What do you say?

221
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,185
Hey, what are you waiting for?

222
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,314
Get in here
before he changes his mind.

223
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:04,799
Eugene, come on out here!
Just come on out here!

224
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:08,674
I want you to go out
and sweep out the back room.

225
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,972
- Right now?
- No. Tomorrow.

226
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:19,840
And a dollar and a quarter.
You stop back soon.

227
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,113
Thanks. I will.

228
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,348
Love your window.
It's so original.

229
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,515
Thank you. See ya later.

230
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,520
Afternoon, Dr. Tremor.

231
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,258
What would you be needing?

232
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,802
I'm just looking for someone.

233
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:40,427
He's in the back.

234
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,904
I wouldn't fret yourself none
over Eugene.

235
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,670
- He's a good boy.
- Of course he's a good boy.

236
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:50,076
Doctor, Leo said the chops
are real nice today.

237
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,275
Good. I'd like to talk to you
for a moment.

238
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,519
Sorry, Doc.
I'm on the clock.

239
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:01,388
Then I'll just take
a moment of your time.

240
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,055
It's okay. Go on.

241
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,901
Eugene, what are you doing?

242
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,595
- I'm sweeping out the bad luck.
- What?

243
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,002
It's a sedge broom
from Ocracoke.

244
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,008
That's an island off the coast
of North Carolina, where I'm from.

245
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,409
Will you excuse us for a moment?
Eugene...

246
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:24,038
- Did you forget our appointment?
- I got a job now.

247
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,049
I don't need a shrink anymore.

248
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:29,143
I don't think he likes
being called that.

249
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:32,018
I'm sorry.

250
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,287
- Hey, Doc. How's it going?
- I'm fine. Thanks, Leo.

251
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,794
Just trying to have a chat
with Eugene, if that's all right.

252
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:40,296
Sure, sure.
Take your time.

253
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:46,530
Honey, what are you doing
cutting up all those chops?

254
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,505
We'll have no place to put them
when the delivery truck shows up.

255
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,736
I don't see that as a problem.
They won't be arriving today.

256
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:55,210
- They called?
- No, not yet.

257
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,841
- I'm really getting good at this.
- I thought we had an agreement.

258
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,713
You were going to see me
until the end of the summer...

259
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,811
before we decided whether
you need a shrink... psychiatrist.

260
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:07,517
That was an agreement that you
and my probation officer made.

261
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,753
I'm just a troubled kid, Doc.

262
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,421
Who's been telling you that?
You're no trouble at all.

263
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:18,458
Eugene, I am thrilled
you found a job.

264
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:23,700
It's a positive move, but I
don't think it precludes therapy.

265
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,743
We've still got some things
to talk about.

266
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:28,368
Honey, those chops
are gonna dry out.

267
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,505
Nobody's gonna want
to buy them tomorrow.

268
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:37,186
It's all in the rhythm, isn't it?

269
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,725
Out of my way, asshole.
Oh, thank God you're open.

270
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:43,920
He's standing there with
that little-boy-lost look.

271
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,259
"I'm an artist, so it's cool
if my right brain's oatmeal.

272
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,560
Did Jackson Pollack remember
to bring home veal chops?"

273
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,726
I said,
"Cut it out, Julian.

274
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,337
That stopped being cute the day
you got out of art school.

275
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:56,566
I pay for the food!
You can pick it up!"

276
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,811
So now I've got a sit-down dinner
for 24 influential critics...

277
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:03,210
and art dealers
in less than three hours.

278
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:07,251
I'm hoping one will discover the
bugger and take him off my hands.

279
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,116
Of course you're thinking,
"It's her fault.

280
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,123
What kind of sane woman
gets involved with a man...

281
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,522
with pretensions to paint?"

282
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:17,686
But I'm throwing myself
on your mercy.

283
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:22,027
I need veal chops.
Lots of them. Now.

284
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,636
- What's this?
- Veal chops. Lots of them. Now.

285
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:35,813
How'd you do that?

286
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,874
- Oh, great window.
- Bye.

287
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:44,480
Yeah. How did she do that?

288
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:50,187
Eugene, why don't you
stop by tonight at 6:00?

289
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,160
We'll talk about this choice.

290
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:58,528
Don't worry, Doctor.
I'll take good care of him.

291
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,934
I appreciate that, Mrs. Lemke.

292
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,968
Say hey to your gal for me.

293
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:09,444
Oh, that's right.
You and Robyn had a brief...

294
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:12,517
or, shall we say,
influential, encounter.

295
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,882
I'm curious, Mrs. Lemke.

296
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:17,579
Why would you suggest
we get married?

297
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:23,016
What I say and what people hear
aren't always the same thing.

298
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,926
Don't you find that
in your calling, Doctor?

299
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:38,140
I never told your sweetheart
to marry with you.

300
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,069
I can see you sparking to her.

301
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,775
A man like you needs someone
bigger than life itself.

302
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,352
But she's not gonna be the one
you'll settle with.

303
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:50,978
Could you give me a hand?

304
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:52,886
Yes. Sure.

305
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,549
Thanks.

306
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:02,098
Can I offer you
a little professional advice?

307
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,293
A scholar like you?
I'd be honored.

308
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,336
Good.

309
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:12,006
I believe in female intuition,
Mrs. Lemke, to an extent...

310
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,738
It's just a specific manifestation
of the collective unconscious...

311
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:18,475
but you might want to be careful
about ordering your life...

312
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:22,417
or anyone else's
for that matter...

313
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,456
on such a primitive instinct.

314
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:29,518
I'll keep that in mind.

315
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,653
Good. Good.

316
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,099
Would you get the door?

317
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,112
Eugene, I'll see you later.

318
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,683
That boy's tongue's
long enough to cut his throat.

319
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,775
I was going to say that.

320
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,514
Honey, it's for...

321
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:02,183
You want to get that?

322
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,132
Lemke's.

323
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,462
What do you mean
you can't get here?

324
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,540
I need the goddamn beef today!

325
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:18,973
I better take
my mess out of here.

326
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,535
- What? A cracked axle?
- Eugene, mind the store.

327
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:23,636
You bet.

328
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,740
Wash your hands before
you touch that meat.

329
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,731
Hi, girls.
How are you today?

330
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:51,706
Good, real good.
Just out for a stroll.

331
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:14,558
I don't think
I've seen you here before.

332
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:18,363
I just moved up here
with my husband.

333
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:20,027
Maybe you know him.

334
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,934
His name's Leo Lemke.

335
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,302
The butcher?

336
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:29,575
Hi. Let me know
if you need help.

337
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,975
Well, actually, I do.

338
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:35,484
I'm looking for
something dowdy and plain.

339
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,020
What's the occasion?

340
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,749
A church recital.

341
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:02,405
"Lead us not into temptation."

342
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:17,562
It's so glamorous.

343
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:22,659
You know, with your hair done up
and some nice shoes...

344
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:26,066
Been a while since
you were in church.

345
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:31,908
I see you wearing this
at a nightclub...

346
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:36,779
and you're standing
in front of a room full of people...

347
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,246
and you're...

348
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:42,913
and you're singing.

349
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:51,887
You could always frump these up
with pearls and pumps.

350
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,928
I'll take this one.

351
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,271
How much are these?

352
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,437
Those are 350.

353
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:10,077
I think I got that.
This is three.

354
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:11,739
I got the change.

355
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,841
There you go.

356
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,850
I got to get back to work.

357
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,717
Thank ya.

358
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,182
See ya later.

359
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:28,696
I think I've made a breakthrough.

360
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,367
I'm gonna sing the blues.

361
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,135
Sing the blues.

362
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,066
What exactly does that mean to you?

363
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:40,371
A lounge act.

364
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:45,177
Actually, I met
this wonderful woman...

365
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,012
in a clothing store...

366
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:51,350
and I don't remember
exactly what she said...

367
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,787
but it feels right.

368
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,449
I'm gonna sing.

369
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,655
All right.
You feel you'd like to sing.

370
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:02,529
But why do you think
a clerk in a clothing store...

371
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,534
is having such a profound
effect on you?

372
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,366
No, no.
She's not a clerk.

373
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,804
I think she works
in the butcher's shop...

374
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,637
or something, but...

375
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,643
she is so wise.

376
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,407
Stella...

377
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,778
a woman as intelligent
and insightful as yourself...

378
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:22,318
doesn't need some clairvoyant
to tell you how to live your life.

379
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,149
That's why we're here.

380
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:28,189
Do you really think
she's clairvoyant?

381
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:55,078
- Hi.
- Good evening.

382
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,950
Who did that to your window?

383
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:01,287
Maybe I should do something
like that at the store.

384
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:03,360
About those shoes...

385
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,691
Oh, they are so cozy.

386
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,162
You're working in them?

387
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:10,764
What's that for?

388
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,666
Supper...

389
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,032
for you and a friend.

390
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,865
Friends I got plenty of.

391
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:20,274
It's love that's left me wanting.

392
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:25,173
Well, don't despair.
It takes as long as it takes.

393
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:26,682
What?

394
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:35,822
It bothers Leo when I get
to talking this way.

395
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,837
There's two faces.

396
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,274
No, it's one face
with two sides.

397
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,278
On one side...

398
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:59,009
there's violence.

399
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,787
But not to her. It's...

400
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:08,587
It's just to men who've
treated her unkindly.

401
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,593
On the other...

402
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:17,431
she's looking for love...

403
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:21,266
but she's confused...

404
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:23,272
'cause she...

405
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,674
well, 'cause she's
just looking for...

406
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,976
she's just looking for it
in the wrong house.

407
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:35,109
God love her.
I can't wait.

408
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,949
You just stick close
to your front porch.

409
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,455
You're gonna be cooking
for two real soon.

410
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,995
Hey, do you think my husband would
like me in something like that?

411
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:50,264
I mean, it's just
so sophisticated, and...

412
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:51,699
you know.

413
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,567
No.
I think you look great.

414
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,370
What do I owe you?

415
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,672
Oh, goodness, nothing.
It's a gift.

416
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,337
Thanks.

417
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,613
- Thanks.
- See ya later.

418
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:12,519
Marina, there's a lot of nuts
in this city.

419
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:14,147
You don't want people
thinking you're one of them.

420
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,954
So, how about, like...

421
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:20,462
no more of this
hocus-pocus talk, huh?

422
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:23,625
Goodness, Leo, I'm just
trying to help out.

423
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:27,193
Honey, we're in the business
of selling meat, not giving advice.

424
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,637
I got to tell you,
it's giving me the creeps.

425
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:33,440
How come?

426
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:37,881
I...

427
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,419
You...

428
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,620
I got to go get a drink.

429
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:37,471
Hey, Leo.

430
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:41,443
I just heard the news.
How's married life?

431
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:43,673
Hit me, Luis, hard.

432
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,512
Darling!

433
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:56,119
Honey!

434
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:58,161
Come over here, sweetheart.

435
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,165
Molly, Gina.
How are you ladies this evening?

436
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:13,766
Fine. Come.
Sit down. It's for you.

437
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,641
Thank you.

438
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:18,710
So...

439
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,784
how's love everlasting?

440
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,555
Oh, we're just
smoothing out the creases.

441
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:28,386
Everything has a way of working
itself out, doesn't it?

442
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,490
A wedding present.
You need a mojo.

443
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,801
It's a sack of charms.

444
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:41,804
Some herbs, dried flowers,
a little spice.

445
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:46,639
Some roots, nut shells,
spider webs, candle wax.

446
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,575
Personally, I like cumin.

447
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,738
Yeah?
You use cumin?

448
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:54,579
I never use cumin.
Goat's hair is nice.

449
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,246
It helps clear up the vision,
so what you see is...

450
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,254
What you end up getting.

451
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:01,791
Exactly.

452
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:04,555
Thank you, ladies.

453
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,459
You know, though...

454
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:09,226
what's meant to be
just can't be changed.

455
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:15,296
Hard times demand an open mind.

456
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:16,532
Wear it.

457
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:22,206
Nice shoes, Alex.
Jackie Gleason collection?

458
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:23,905
You like 'em?

459
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,017
By the way, I can't go away
with you and Robyn next weekend.

460
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,918
What do you mean you can't
go away next weekend?

461
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,888
Something came up.

462
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,822
I rented this house
five months ago.

463
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:38,487
I've been looking forward
to this weekend together.

464
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:39,927
It was unexpected.

465
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,795
We're supposed to relax
and have fun, goddamn it.

466
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,300
I scheduled you a blind date
for Saturday night.

467
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,468
I already have a date,
thank you.

468
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:51,269
Oh, that's something else.

469
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,843
- Bring her along.
- I don't know who she is yet.

470
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:59,010
- I'm curious.
- Oh, no.

471
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:01,016
No, no.
You have a date with somebody...

472
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:02,608
but you don't know who it is.

473
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:04,778
- Shut up and putt.
- No.

474
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:06,446
I'm always interested
when my friends show...

475
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:08,855
early signs of dementia praecox.

476
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:12,555
Listen, Alex...

477
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:16,030
I know it sounds flaky,
but I met this wonderful woman...

478
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:18,192
and she says I'll be
cooking for two soon...

479
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:20,202
and I really want to believe her.

480
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,465
- Believe who?
- The butcher's wife.

481
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:57,640
<i>I knew that one day... </i>

482
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,403
<i>one day... </i>

483
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:02,603
<i>I ran from you, Chauncey, </i>
<i>as far as I could. </i>

484
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:05,045
<i>So why do I keep ending up</i>
<i>back in your arms? </i>

485
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,276
<i>Because that's where</i>
<i>you were meant to be... </i>

486
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:10,548
<i>safe and warm</i>
<i>in my sweet embrace. </i>

487
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:13,647
<i>Come to Uncle Chauncey, </i>
<i>my little passion flower. </i>

488
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:16,090
<i>I only want</i>
<i>what's best for us. </i>

489
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:26,462
<i>I told you one of us</i>
<i>would end up hurt. </i>

490
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:32,802
<i>Why does everything</i>
<i>I touch die? </i>

491
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:34,501
It's the gun, sweetheart.

492
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,842
- The gun.
- One little box he brings down!

493
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:41,213
A big man like that, he brings
one box! One teeny little box!

494
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,482
Let's load this thing up!
I can't believe it.

495
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:47,455
It's an awfully long distance
from Georgia.

496
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:50,751
Hey, Eugene.

497
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,724
I got this thing for you,
and I wanted to give it to you.

498
00:38:56,834 --> 00:39:00,634
I wanted you to open it here.

499
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:03,707
- Thanks.
- Just a little present...

500
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:07,266
but it means something special to
me, and I wanted to give it to you.

501
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:10,778
Eugene, she's beautiful.
Come here.

502
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,849
I named her Rosalita.

503
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,544
She's so sweet.
Hey, Rosalita.

504
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:20,015
You like her?

505
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:24,026
Oh, she's beautiful.
Thank you so much.

506
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,892
Eugene, you're late!
Get your butt in gear now!

507
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:28,897
Go on.

508
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:34,566
Leo, if you want
to pass words with me...

509
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,640
will you please not
take it out on him?

510
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,341
Bless you.

511
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:42,002
Are you wearing some
new kind of perfume?

512
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:46,348
I think you may be allergic
to my new mojo.

513
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,415
Let me get you a tissue.

514
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,923
- Here you go.
- What the hell is that?

515
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:57,891
Oh, this is Rosalita.

516
00:39:57,995 --> 00:39:59,553
Isn't she sweet?

517
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:02,655
What do you want
with a live chicken?

518
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,701
No, don't tell me.

519
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:07,930
Don't... Don't tell me.

520
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,199
I don't want to know.

521
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:13,401
Don't say nothing.
Just don't.

522
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,706
It's just a little chick.

523
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:28,347
I never thought I'd see
the inside of a shrink's office.

524
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,927
It looks so normal.

525
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:33,929
I was expecting something
a little more psycho.

526
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:35,430
Pervy, you know?

527
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,728
Uh-huh.
How can I help you, Leo?

528
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:39,632
I don't need help.
I'm normal.

529
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,800
It's my wife.

530
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,173
I mean, I know we've only been
married for a couple of days...

531
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:56,344
but I think she might be nuts,
if you know what I mean.

532
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:59,648
Yes.
I think I have an idea.

533
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:02,487
Though "nuts" isn't a word
I'm comfortable with.

534
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:04,390
Me neither.

535
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:08,797
See, we got married real quick,
like the day we met.

536
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:11,527
She insisted.

537
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:15,696
Swear to God, she told me
I was the man of her dreams.

538
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,003
I had no idea
she really meant it.

539
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,236
So we took some holy vows.

540
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:27,713
I believe a man
is only as good as his vows...

541
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:32,016
but now I think maybe she married me
'cause of these dreams of hers.

542
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:35,692
She believes in 'em, Doc.

543
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:41,663
It's not natural.

544
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:45,064
It could be some sort of complex
in her head, right?

545
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,103
Which means she's nuts.

546
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:51,197
And if she's nuts, how do I
even know if she loves me?

547
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,869
So I'm thinking...

548
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:59,641
dreams, nuts...

549
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,513
Sounds like your field.

550
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:07,151
And she's really
spooking me now, Doc.

551
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:09,419
She's got some live
chicken running around...

552
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,052
and she's wearing some
hojo around her neck.

553
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:14,926
You gotta cure her,
or we're in big trouble.

554
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,859
Doc, I been to Brooklyn.
I know about voodoo.

555
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:47,924
Hey, Leo.

556
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,599
- Where's the new missus?
- She's fine, thanks.

557
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:54,762
I said where.
Never mind.

558
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,635
Make sure she
gets this, okay?

559
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:59,970
Yeah, sure.

560
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,044
So when you going to
give it to her?

561
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:04,773
- Don't worry.
- Do I look worried?

562
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:10,479
It's a love token.
It'll seal your love forever.

563
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:26,596
Jesus.
Oh, Mrs. Lemke.

564
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:30,765
Did I...

565
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:34,435
Oh, boy. Did, I...
Did I leave the door unlocked?

566
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:37,308
Where's the couch?

567
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,314
I don't use a couch.

568
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:44,485
I don't know if you've ever been
in therapy before.

569
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:50,189
- That's my chair.
- Oh, it is?

570
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,194
Well, it's nice.

571
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,200
It's important you know...

572
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,770
that I can be
of absolutely no help...

573
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:03,101
unless you want to be here.

574
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,142
You, of course,
are free to go at any time.

575
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:09,144
I promised Leo I'd come.

576
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,840
Good. Why?

577
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:15,680
Well, I expect he thinks
I'm a little touched.

578
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:18,880
"Touched"? Interesting word.

579
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,822
What exactly does it mean to you?

580
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:25,292
Well, that's a fine question.

581
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:28,422
I reckon it's 'cause I know things
before he does...

582
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:30,659
and that just
gives him the shivers.

583
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:33,861
Yes.

584
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:39,267
Well, come on.
Women have been burned for less.

585
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:42,311
So you know things.

586
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:44,745
Like telling a total stranger
that she should...

587
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,078
get up in front
of a crowd and sing...

588
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,345
when she might not be ready
for such a bold move...

589
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:51,887
and is liable to get
terribly discouraged.

590
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,991
You know Stella?

591
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:57,993
Or telling a lonely woman that she
should wait for love to find her...

592
00:44:58,095 --> 00:45:00,222
when she'd be better off
getting out there and finding...

593
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:01,695
But that's all true.

594
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,993
Or telling my girlfriend
that she should marry me.

595
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:06,592
Now, here we go again.

596
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,604
No. People...

597
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:11,139
I can't help
what I see, can I?

598
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:13,072
But you can help what you say.

599
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:21,211
Do you have visions?
Do you hear voices?

600
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:23,786
Premonitions?

601
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,787
Do you roller-skate?

602
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:33,155
How exactly does roller-skating
figure into your gift?

603
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:36,460
Oh, it doesn't.
I just wanted to have a little fun.

604
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:41,396
Yeah, well, it is highly unorthodox
to leave the office with a patient.

605
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:44,372
I'm not your patient, Doctor.
I'm doing it for Leo.

606
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:47,967
If you want to hear how crazy I am,
you better just lace up.

607
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:55,447
What am I doing here?

608
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:59,181
Some crazy woman in the clothing
store put me up to this.

609
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:01,780
No wonder I'm in therapy.
I'm too impressionable.

610
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:03,792
Don't you think?

611
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:05,122
You'll be great.

612
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:11,268
If only I were black,
I'd feel so much better.

613
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:13,801
Luis, rye and soda.
Hold the soda.

614
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,166
Make it a double.

615
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,172
I don't want to talk about women...

616
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,175
and I don't want to
talk about my wife.

617
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,006
Oh, you're married?

618
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:25,980
Leo, this is Stella Kefauver,
our new lounge act.

619
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,017
She's gonna class up the joint.

620
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,712
You got your work cut out for you.

621
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:34,116
Hit me again, Luis.

622
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:37,386
Bessie Smith?

623
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:41,294
You sing Bessie Smith?
A skinny little thing like you?

624
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:44,299
- Okay, I'll sing the Debby Boone.
- No, no, no.

625
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:46,329
I love Bessie.

626
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:50,429
Stella, you're on.

627
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:07,148
You're welcome.

628
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,674
You been holding out
on me, Luis?

629
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,680
What do you think?

630
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:39,617
Good evening.
For my first selection...

631
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:41,849
I would like to sing
"In the Dark."

632
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:48,431
<i>In the dark</i>

633
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:50,260
<i>It's just... </i>

634
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:54,294
Sorry.

635
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:56,463
It's all right.
It's okay.

636
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:59,404
Oh, boy.

637
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:02,137
<i>In the dark</i>

638
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:06,911
<i>It's just you and I</i>

639
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:11,054
<i>Not a sound</i>

640
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:15,056
<i>There's not one sigh</i>

641
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:22,899
<i>Just the beat of my poor heart</i>

642
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,764
<i>In the dark</i>

643
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:34,206
<i>But soon</i>

644
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:38,714
<i>This dance will be ending</i>

645
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:44,082
<i>And we're gonna be missed</i>

646
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,381
<i>Gee</i>

647
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:53,758
<i>But I'm not pretending</i>

648
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:58,130
<i>'Cause I swear it's fun</i>

649
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:00,430
<i>Fun to be kissed</i>

650
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:03,734
<i>Oh, in the dark</i>

651
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:08,301
<i>Now we will find</i>

652
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,607
<i>What the rest</i>

653
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:15,947
<i>Have left behind</i>

654
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:20,022
<i>Just let them dance</i>

655
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:25,987
<i>We're gonna find romance</i>

656
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,825
<i>In the dark</i>

657
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,283
Boy, I miss the wind.

658
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,893
You know, no wind
will make you stale.

659
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:02,757
You were going to explain to me...

660
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:05,596
about the mechanics
of your clairvoyance.

661
00:50:05,702 --> 00:50:08,102
You know,
it's so good to cut loose.

662
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:10,105
Yeah. It sure is.

663
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:14,567
Mrs. Lemke, come on.
I promised your husband.

664
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,202
Please.

665
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:17,746
Okay.

666
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,917
- You all right?
- Yeah. Good.

667
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:28,958
It's like you're standing
in the middle of a doughnut.

668
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:31,151
And depending on which way you turn,
you can tell...

669
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:33,194
what's going on in folks' lives.

670
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:37,824
If you lean one way,
it's like "whoosh."

671
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:40,300
You just catch
a piece of the past.

672
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:43,534
And if you turn yourself a bit...

673
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,801
you'll bump right into the future.

674
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:49,709
But it's like somebody's running me
my own private picture show...

675
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:51,508
in stops and starts.

676
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:54,616
I'm curious.
What do you mean, "picture show"?

677
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,981
Here. Give me your hands.

678
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:06,328
Well, there's the sea...

679
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:10,330
and your little naked body...

680
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:13,796
and you're curling
your toes up in the sand.

681
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:21,174
White flowers at a funeral.

682
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:24,940
Your mama.

683
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:29,745
She's real glad that she gave you
that red drum set.

684
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:37,322
And there you are, barely six.

685
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:41,124
You've got
these red bumps all over...

686
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:44,530
and they're just making you itch.

687
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:46,693
You just want to scratch.

688
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:50,469
Seven.

689
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:53,008
I was...

690
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,236
I was seven.

691
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:15,492
<i>Move me again</i>
<i>because I don't care</i>

692
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,558
<i>Move me 'cause I don't care</i>

693
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:44,856
Luis, champagne
for Mrs. Kefauver.

694
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:47,088
Miss. And call me Stella.

695
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:50,826
Champagne? What do you
think this is, the Copa?

696
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:53,198
We got Bud Light on draft.

697
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:56,500
Stella, you are music to my ears.

698
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:58,904
Gorgeous.
You sing like an angel.

699
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,034
A choir of angels.

700
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:02,839
Thank you so much.

701
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:05,312
You are some sort of singer, lady.

702
00:53:05,415 --> 00:53:06,575
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

703
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:09,777
You know, I hear your songs...

704
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:11,911
and I get pictures in my head.

705
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:15,388
All soft and dreamy.
Like the movies.

706
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,890
Leo, do you really think so?

707
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:26,628
There aren't many of us that like
blues. We got to stick together.

708
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:31,369
I'd like that.

709
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:44,114
This ain't the kind of place
I imagined you working at.

710
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,917
You imagined me?

711
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:49,457
Yeah. Sure.

712
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:54,686
But I always thought
you blues singers...

713
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:58,359
slept all day
and stayed out all night.

714
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:00,231
- And lived in Paris.
- Yeah.

715
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:01,565
I know.

716
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:05,505
And now I'm here teaching holy music
to pimply-faced kids.

717
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:21,286
So, Leo...

718
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:23,518
what's on your mind?

719
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:26,391
I got to tell you something.

720
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:28,396
Sure. Anything.

721
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,865
It's about my wife.

722
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:36,228
The thing is...

723
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:39,035
I don't think we got married
for the right reasons.

724
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:43,271
It seemed to make sense when
she proposed, but... I don't know.

725
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,746
Maybe I just don't know
how to be her husband.

726
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:48,682
Since I brought her back here,
nothing's been working out.

727
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:51,951
Maybe it's just not meant to be.

728
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:56,992
No. She keeps telling me
I'm the man she was meant to marry.

729
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:58,993
The thing is...

730
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:05,433
Stella, I know
it's not right, but...

731
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:11,767
I got this feeling for you.

732
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:22,015
I got the same feeling too.

733
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,161
But my wife...

734
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:37,762
she's so fragile.

735
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:39,767
It would send her
right off the deep end.

736
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:41,769
A short trip for her.

737
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:46,175
You're right.

738
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:49,807
We'll have a higher love.

739
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:55,985
We won't wallow in the degradation
of earthly desires.

740
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:58,816
Jesus, you even talk like an angel.

741
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,664
A toad.

742
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:23,578
I don't know what to say.

743
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,908
How...

744
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:27,844
How thoughtful.

745
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:38,419
It's hard to get your bearings
when you can't even see the stars.

746
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:41,292
Yes. Yes.

747
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:45,566
The other night,
you were looking for the stars...

748
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:47,431
in your nightgown.

749
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:51,663
You were watching me?

750
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,844
Last week I saw something
I still don't believe...

751
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:02,042
and I've studied the stars
since I was a kid.

752
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:05,383
I saw a twin-tailed comet
just... right in.

753
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:07,752
Really? Me too.

754
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:10,724
That was my definite sign
that love was on its way.

755
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:16,426
How exactly did you
come to marry Leo?

756
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:18,694
I was supposed to marry Leo.

757
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:23,329
I knew it when I saw his
smile in my dreams.

758
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:25,065
He's my split-apart.

759
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:27,603
What's a split-apart?

760
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:31,004
Long ago before man and woman...

761
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:33,308
when time was young,
there were these beings.

762
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:35,611
- Beans?
- Beings.

763
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:38,949
Oh. Beings.
Yeah.

764
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:42,286
Right.
So we were kind of odd-looking...

765
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:45,293
but just as happy
as pigs in a puddle...

766
00:57:45,395 --> 00:57:47,863
and we didn't need
no one for nothing, and...

767
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:52,128
And we could reproduce
by ourselves and... Yeah.

768
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:55,363
You don't know this story.

769
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,440
- You can't.
- I do. I do.

770
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:59,439
Go ahead. Try me.

771
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:01,635
Okay.

772
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:04,144
The spirits
that ruled the world then...

773
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:06,272
Envied our joy and independence.

774
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:09,215
And so they split us apart.

775
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:19,755
Like clams on a half shell
and then scattered us to the wind.

776
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:24,189
You can still see the scar...

777
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,996
which, of course, is the...

778
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:29,401
navel.

779
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:37,545
Right.
The bellybutton.

780
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:48,717
You were saying.

781
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:51,225
So we're the kinfolk
of these old split-aparts...

782
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:54,888
and mostly we're miserable
on account of we spend our lives...

783
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:57,728
Iooking for our
long-lost other half.

784
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:01,326
And sometimes...

785
00:59:01,437 --> 00:59:06,568
getting so caught up in that search
for that special person that...

786
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,609
they don't even notice.

787
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:09,939
Boom, there they are.

788
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,980
Right before their very eyes.

789
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:18,283
- How'd you know this?
- Magic.

790
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:22,020
I never would've thought
you had it in ya.

791
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:24,851
Actually, everybody knows it.

792
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:26,588
It's Plato.

793
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:30,393
It's a corruption, of course,
but Plato nonetheless.

794
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,230
Well, my grammy told it to me.

795
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:35,236
She must be well-read.

796
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:37,238
Blind since birth.

797
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:45,009
I've never met anyone
quite like you, Mrs. Lemke.

798
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:48,412
You ought to get out more.

799
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:52,284
And you can call me Marina.

800
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,053
Marina... It's pretty.

801
00:59:59,162 --> 01:00:00,595
It's pretty.

802
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:17,245
Look, Marina.

803
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,584
Fooling yourself into believing
you married Leo...

804
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:24,812
because your grammy
screwed up Plato, that's...

805
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:26,821
that's dangerous territory.

806
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:30,853
Well, I appreciate
your concern, Doctor...

807
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,554
but I wouldn't expect a man
like you to understand.

808
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,290
Oh, no, I do understand.

809
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:37,889
And I want you to understand,
because your impulsive behavior...

810
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:40,265
is jeopardizing your marriage.

811
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:43,703
- Perhaps Leo just showed up...
- He didn't just show up.

812
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,673
How the hell you think he got
to Ocracoke in the first place?

813
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:51,110
- I suggested he take a vacation.
- It was his destiny.

814
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:54,479
Mrs. Lemke, these delusions
are not healthy.

815
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:57,178
- I can help...
- You know what? You don't know zip...

816
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:58,947
about love or life, Doctor...

817
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:01,751
and I don't need you strewing
your learning all over me.

818
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,624
Do not walk away from this!
These fantasies...

819
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:10,165
Your fantasies of being all-seeing
and all-powerful are dangerous...

820
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:11,699
and they're...

821
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:15,362
It's just a hell of a way
to run your life!

822
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:18,702
My God, you didn't dream
Leo into your life...

823
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:22,004
Of course I did.
I just made a mistake.

824
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:31,586
It's all right.
It's okay. That's...

825
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:36,148
Awareness is the first
and most difficult step.

826
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:40,794
Honestly, I...

827
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:45,229
I understand what it's like
to think you know everything.

828
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:50,566
It's really terrible.
I've made a wreck...

829
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:54,040
of Leo's life and my life
and two innocent strangers.

830
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:56,577
I've really got to go
figure this out...

831
01:01:56,679 --> 01:01:58,203
and...

832
01:01:59,482 --> 01:02:01,211
fix it.

833
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:17,761
You ended up skating
in the park with a patient.

834
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:19,994
It's classic countertransference.

835
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:24,066
You allowed her to manipulate you

836
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:28,769
into a vulnerable...
never mind unprofessional... situation...

837
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:31,779
where she controlled you.

838
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:34,247
This is freshman psychology, Alex.

839
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:41,552
Oh, good. Oh, good. Good.

840
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:43,215
Dr. Tremor...

841
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:47,125
don't blow a great career
on a cute piece of ass.

842
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:49,892
You keep your dick
in your pants...

843
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:51,091
your id in check...

844
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:55,135
and you remember
that we have a mission...

845
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:56,865
in this world.

846
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:01,376
Did you sleep well?

847
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:03,445
I didn't hear you
come in last night.

848
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:05,070
I didn't want to wake you.

849
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:08,581
Lend me a hand with this?
It's stuck.

850
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:25,566
Are you trying to tell me something?

851
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:28,869
No.
You trying to tell me something?

852
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:30,700
No.

853
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,206
Say it with flowers?

854
01:03:38,915 --> 01:03:40,678
For the first time...

855
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:44,651
I can almost imagine
a world without therapy.

856
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:45,686
Amen.

857
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:49,519
Well, I'm glad our time together
is having such a positive effect.

858
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:53,618
It's been good,
but I owe this one to that psychic.

859
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:56,789
I thought we dealt with that.

860
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:59,697
Don't worry. It's not like
I'm cured or anything.

861
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:02,532
Good.
Well, not good...

862
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:13,805
Forgive me, Doctor,
for I have sinned.

863
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:19,682
But he is such a good man,
and I think he really likes me.

864
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:21,586
Is he married?

865
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,259
Well, yes. But...

866
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:29,822
his wife's not well...

867
01:04:29,932 --> 01:04:32,799
which, of course,
fills me with guilt.

868
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:36,895
But she's making him miserable,
so I rationalize...

869
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:38,633
by figuring that...

870
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:41,301
I'm bringing some
well-earned joy to his life.

871
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:46,105
You're disappointed, aren't you?

872
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:47,876
I'm curious.

873
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:52,418
Oh, no. You wouldn't be
if you knew him.

874
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:55,115
I mean, this is it.

875
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:58,057
You always know when the right person
walks into your life.

876
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,822
I always know when
the wrong person walks in...

877
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:03,956
and it doesn't feel
that way at all, so...

878
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:06,091
I'm sure Leo's the one.

879
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:09,862
Leo?

880
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:12,600
That's his name... Leo.

881
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,813
I really think you'd like him.

882
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:32,524
- Here's your hot dogs.
- No, no, sweetheart. Chops.

883
01:05:32,628 --> 01:05:34,255
- Chops.
- Chops.

884
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:40,299
Great sign.
Really makes you want to come in here.

885
01:05:40,403 --> 01:05:43,372
- Oh. It's you.
- Hi.

886
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:46,930
I didn't know you worked here.

887
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:50,342
- How'd that dress work out?
- Great.

888
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:52,538
Everything's working out great.

889
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:57,085
Thanks to you, I'm singing
at this cabaret. Dellago's?

890
01:05:57,186 --> 01:06:00,314
Oh, I know that place.
My husband likes it.

891
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:02,584
Okay, it's a bar.

892
01:06:04,393 --> 01:06:08,830
But I met this
really wonderful man.

893
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:12,329
Hey, maybe you can
tell me if we're going to...

894
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:14,335
Oh, no. Never mind.

895
01:06:14,437 --> 01:06:16,564
I don't want to know.
Just pray for me.

896
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:19,903
Pray for all of us, darling.

897
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:23,172
Would it be all right
if I put up a flyer?

898
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:25,645
Well, sure. I'd be proud.

899
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:27,908
I've got to tell Leo
to get up there to see you.

900
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:30,917
He just loves that old stuff.

901
01:06:33,522 --> 01:06:35,547
Leo?

902
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:37,148
My husband.

903
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,288
That'll be 10.

904
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:50,971
Well, see ya.

905
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:55,506
Uh, 10.

906
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:06,312
I've got to find a wife
for my husband.

907
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:09,620
Why not?

908
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:12,784
Thanks.

909
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:19,324
Out of my way, asshole.

910
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:20,561
Guess.

911
01:07:28,844 --> 01:07:32,075
Would you fancy meeting
a cuddly middle-aged man?

912
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:35,573
Sorry. I like them
young and talented.

913
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:37,618
I never go on dates
arranged by my butcher...

914
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,120
but I'd be interested in meeting
the artist who did your window.

915
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:42,349
Is he young?

916
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:43,720
Take my card.

917
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:49,996
Your change.

918
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:53,000
What I wouldn't give
for just a little breeze.

919
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:55,002
Not till September
at the earliest.

920
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:57,129
So now you're doing the weather?

921
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:16,220
The face of God
is a one-way mirror.

922
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,635
You're not listening to me!
I knew it!

923
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:39,405
You're absolutely correct,
and I apologize.

924
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:42,810
Excuse me.

925
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:45,182
You're still not listening to me.

926
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:49,517
- Leo.
- You're in. Good.

927
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,752
What the hell did you do to my wife?

928
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:54,921
- I am with a patient.
- Your fruitcake can wait. Mine can't.

929
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:57,624
You got her trying to fix me up
with strange women.

930
01:08:57,733 --> 01:08:59,928
I don't know what kind of advice
you're giving out...

931
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:02,731
but a few more visits with you,
we can book her a room in Bellevue!

932
01:09:02,838 --> 01:09:04,499
Wait a second!
I am not...

933
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:07,770
Just stay the hell
away from her, okay?

934
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:09,777
You're a dangerous man.

935
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:21,779
- Your clock's stuck.
- I don't want to talk about it!

936
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:28,955
Where's Alex?

937
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:30,964
He's seeing some lunatic.

938
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:38,429
Doctor's wife is not one
of my featured roles.

939
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:42,568
God, Grace, what am I going to do?

940
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:46,045
- What?
- I proposed to him the other night.

941
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:48,309
- No.
- Yes.

942
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:53,046
I can't believe it either,
but I met the most incredible woman.

943
01:09:53,155 --> 01:09:55,487
She just opened my eyes.

944
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:56,751
Me too.

945
01:09:57,993 --> 01:10:00,120
Oh, yeah?
You're seeing someone new?

946
01:10:00,229 --> 01:10:03,732
No. This new girl that works
at the butcher shop.

947
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:06,699
My God. Marina.

948
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:08,736
She's incredible.

949
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:11,135
- Is she for real?
- Absolutely.

950
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:17,444
- What did she tell you?
- To stick close to my front porch.

951
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:20,777
That's why I canceled
my weekend with you guys...

952
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:23,077
to wait for my mystery date.

953
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:25,085
Hey.
You think I'm nuts?

954
01:10:25,187 --> 01:10:28,213
Grace, that's fabulous.

955
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:30,417
Alex thinks I'm insane.

956
01:10:30,526 --> 01:10:32,494
It's his favorite diagnosis.

957
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:37,963
Why do we waste
our time with men?

958
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:40,627
Not all of us do.

959
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:09,357
Oh, Chauncey,
don't touch me there.

960
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:41,750
Mrs. Lemke.

961
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:46,151
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

962
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:48,161
I need to see you.

963
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:49,821
- Oh, well...
- Now.

964
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:55,827
Why don't we just
go to my office?

965
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:57,667
Okay.

966
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:03,574
I was going to talk to you
in the morning.

967
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:05,145
We need to...

968
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,748
We need to be clear
about last night.

969
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:12,685
I acted inappropriately.

970
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:16,280
I never should have seen you
under duress.

971
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:18,292
That was unprofessional.

972
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:30,035
I never should have allowed
the session to leave the office.

973
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:31,868
- That was inexcusable.
- Doctor...

974
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:34,272
Worst of all, I had no business
offering you...

975
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:36,276
a quick-fix analysis of your marriage.

976
01:13:36,378 --> 01:13:38,710
Dr. Tremor,
I saw you in my dreams tonight.

977
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:43,646
Oh, sure.
That's not uncommon.

978
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:47,483
Dreams are important.
And you know...

979
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:49,557
you can keep a little
notebook by the bed...

980
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:53,321
and just write them down
if you're afraid of...

981
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:55,056
What was I doing?

982
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:56,756
Smiling.

983
01:14:03,305 --> 01:14:05,773
Look, Mrs. Lemke...
Marina.

984
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:07,739
All right, listen.

985
01:14:07,843 --> 01:14:10,277
I can't deny that I feel
an attraction for you.

986
01:14:10,412 --> 01:14:12,380
But don't worry.
I know what it is...

987
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:14,607
and how to remedy the situation.

988
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:18,413
There's no cure. Last night,
just for a moment, you knew it.

989
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,545
Love is the leap
that won't be denied.

990
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:22,214
No, no.
This isn't love.

991
01:14:22,324 --> 01:14:25,020
This is what
we doctors like to call...

992
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:30,194
I'll think of it.
Countertransference!

993
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:32,267
You're not listening to me.

994
01:14:32,367 --> 01:14:35,768
Yes, I am,
and I understand exactly...

995
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:37,338
why you're doing this.

996
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:40,006
You do?

997
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:41,666
Yes.

998
01:14:43,712 --> 01:14:45,145
To get even.

999
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:47,676
What for?

1000
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:51,274
Because you're angry at your husband
for commencing an extramarital affair.

1001
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:56,090
What?

1002
01:14:56,191 --> 01:14:57,249
Yes.

1003
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,396
Leo's seeing another woman?

1004
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:03,829
Yes.

1005
01:15:05,734 --> 01:15:08,225
I'm sorry.
I thought you knew.

1006
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,828
Well, if he was, I would.

1007
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:14,673
Who is she?

1008
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:19,675
I'm sorry.
I can't tell you that.

1009
01:15:19,815 --> 01:15:23,216
I can't believe
he's seeing another woman.

1010
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:26,378
My God, we've only been married,
what, three days?

1011
01:15:26,488 --> 01:15:29,616
Marina, last night, you yourself said
you'd made a mistake.

1012
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:31,420
Yes, but it was my mistake...

1013
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:34,223
and I was doing the fixing.

1014
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:37,196
And I'm gonna be the one deciding
who my husband should marry.

1015
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:57,343
Honey, we got to talk.

1016
01:15:57,486 --> 01:16:01,650
I heard you yesterday,
you know, when you were talking.

1017
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:06,819
So I suppose I've been wasting my time
trying to find you the right wife.

1018
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:09,989
Of course you are, honey.
I've got a good wife.

1019
01:16:10,098 --> 01:16:12,430
And we can work things out.
Don't worry.

1020
01:16:12,534 --> 01:16:15,731
- I may be simple, but I'm not stupid.
- What's that supposed to mean?

1021
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:18,431
I suppose lying and cheating
ain't in your vocabulary.

1022
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:22,333
Another day, another dollar.

1023
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:24,571
Eugene, I want
that money back in the till.

1024
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:26,704
What's a till?

1025
01:16:27,783 --> 01:16:30,445
You know I know. You want to
borrow money, that's one thing.

1026
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:33,180
- But I've got no time for thieving.
- Honey.

1027
01:16:33,288 --> 01:16:37,156
- What are you talking about?
- We're $50 short from last night.

1028
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:39,853
Honey, is this what
you're looking for?

1029
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:56,643
Why don't you get a couch, Doc?

1030
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:01,345
I need some advice.

1031
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:03,680
You remember I was telling you
about that girl I like?

1032
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:05,650
Right.

1033
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:09,450
She's got one of
these "Sybil" things going now.

1034
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:12,254
One day she treats me
like I'm Romeo...

1035
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:15,990
the next day she treats me
like I'm public enemy number one.

1036
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:17,622
I can't figure it out.

1037
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,702
The female psyche has eluded men
since the beginning of time, Eugene.

1038
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:24,965
Nice tone, Doc.
Feeling hostile?

1039
01:17:25,073 --> 01:17:27,735
Yes... No.

1040
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:31,210
- We're not here to talk about me.
- That's right. It's my dime.

1041
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:34,645
I'm thinking about
my male pride with this girl.

1042
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:37,810
Maybe I got to dump her.
Then I'm thinking, no...

1043
01:17:37,953 --> 01:17:40,387
maybe I ought to give her
another chance.

1044
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:44,084
Maybe I got to go for broke,
maybe even ask her out.

1045
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:48,129
- So?
- So what if she says no?

1046
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:52,326
Eugene, when confronted
with a risky proposition...

1047
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:54,800
Doc, 10 words or less.
I'm on the clock.

1048
01:18:02,377 --> 01:18:05,938
Love is the leap
that won't be denied.

1049
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:09,482
I was going to say that. Good thinking.
I'll get her to dump the butcher.

1050
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:19,093
I assume when you say "the butcher,"
you're speaking metaphorically.

1051
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:25,667
No, I'm talking about
the old fart I work for.

1052
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:28,465
<i>Old Hannah Brown from 'cross town</i>

1053
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:32,370
<i>Gets full of corn</i>
<i>and starts bringin' 'em down</i>

1054
01:18:32,474 --> 01:18:35,102
<i>Just at the break of day</i>

1055
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:38,771
<i>You can hear old Hannah say</i>

1056
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:43,010
<i>Give me a pigfoot</i>
<i>and a bottle of beer</i>

1057
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:46,747
<i>Send me, I don't care</i>

1058
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:49,322
<i>I feel just like I wanna clown</i>

1059
01:18:49,424 --> 01:18:51,517
<i>Bring the piano player a drink</i>

1060
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:53,355
<i>Because he's bringin'me down</i>

1061
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:56,158
<i>He's got a rhythm</i>
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1062
01:18:56,264 --> 01:18:58,289
<i>When he stomps his feet</i>

1063
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,630
<i>He sends me right off to sleep</i>

1064
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:02,761
<i>Check all your razors and... </i>

1065
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:03,592
So, Leo,
what are you doing here?

1066
01:20:03,698 --> 01:20:06,758
I had to see you.

1067
01:20:06,868 --> 01:20:09,234
- I had to see you too.
- It's my wife.

1068
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:12,135
- I know.
- She's looney tunes.

1069
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:17,242
No, she's wonderful.

1070
01:20:17,345 --> 01:20:18,607
My wife?

1071
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:22,477
- She's the one who got me singing.
- Marina?

1072
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:27,218
So, the thing is...

1073
01:20:27,355 --> 01:20:28,982
The thing is...

1074
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:36,623
You're grade "A," Stella,
prime cut.

1075
01:20:36,731 --> 01:20:38,358
Together we're choice.

1076
01:20:40,302 --> 01:20:42,236
But my wife ain't got
nobody but me...

1077
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:46,330
to see her through
her time of trouble.

1078
01:20:46,441 --> 01:20:50,275
- We got to break it off, Leo.
- I can't just go abandoning her.

1079
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:57,545
Are you women always one step ahead?
It's kind of spooky.

1080
01:21:00,055 --> 01:21:01,420
So...

1081
01:21:02,924 --> 01:21:04,858
do you want this back?

1082
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:27,674
Damn.

1083
01:21:27,782 --> 01:21:30,945
I just want to tell you
I'm real sorry for accusing you.

1084
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:34,544
I just don't know
what's the matter with me...

1085
01:21:34,689 --> 01:21:37,317
and I hope you can forgive me.

1086
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:41,821
I can.

1087
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:48,366
I really loved the flowers.
And the window.

1088
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:51,166
Really.

1089
01:21:51,273 --> 01:21:53,173
There was an art lady
who came to the store today...

1090
01:21:53,275 --> 01:21:55,209
and she really loved it too.

1091
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:58,768
She said you should call her...

1092
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,814
and I think you should too...

1093
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:03,851
'cause you've really got
something special.

1094
01:22:03,952 --> 01:22:05,715
No, I don't.

1095
01:22:05,854 --> 01:22:08,322
No, a true gift.
I mean it.

1096
01:22:15,897 --> 01:22:20,334
He's such a good man,
too, Doctor.

1097
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:24,201
But I guess you were right,
as usual.

1098
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:28,538
If only his wife wasn't
such a great lady.

1099
01:22:28,643 --> 01:22:32,374
But the thing is,
I know he loves me.

1100
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,607
And I love him.

1101
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:37,116
Such sweet sorrow.

1102
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:39,709
God, love hurts!

1103
01:22:39,854 --> 01:22:43,984
Wait a second. You mean to tell me
that Leo broke it off?

1104
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:47,060
Maybe they're really not
meant for each other.

1105
01:22:47,162 --> 01:22:48,754
Who?

1106
01:22:48,863 --> 01:22:50,387
Leo and Marina.

1107
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:56,660
I never told you
her name was Marina.

1108
01:22:57,672 --> 01:22:58,934
Of course you did.

1109
01:23:00,575 --> 01:23:02,736
No, I don't think so.

1110
01:23:02,844 --> 01:23:05,039
Sorry, then. My mistake.

1111
01:23:05,146 --> 01:23:08,274
No. That's her name.
I just...

1112
01:23:09,351 --> 01:23:11,251
don't remember telling you that.

1113
01:23:11,353 --> 01:23:14,288
You two really love
each other, right?

1114
01:23:14,389 --> 01:23:17,449
- Who?
- You and Leo, for God's sake.

1115
01:23:17,592 --> 01:23:22,495
- Gee, I think so.
- Yes or no? Stella, commit.

1116
01:23:22,597 --> 01:23:24,258
- Yes!
- Fine!

1117
01:23:24,366 --> 01:23:27,927
There. Now, if he's
the right man for you...

1118
01:23:28,036 --> 01:23:31,005
you can't let him slip by, can you?

1119
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:33,074
Do you mind if I...
Can I?

1120
01:23:36,911 --> 01:23:38,242
But...

1121
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:40,109
he's married.

1122
01:23:40,215 --> 01:23:43,912
What about my addiction to failure
in the form of married men?

1123
01:23:46,421 --> 01:23:50,016
Your addiction to failure stems
from your failure to commit.

1124
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:52,490
And your failure to commit
stems from, of course...

1125
01:23:52,594 --> 01:23:54,084
your lack of trust.

1126
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:55,753
I'm a little confused.

1127
01:23:58,633 --> 01:24:02,626
You listen to me, Stella.
I am your psychiatrist.

1128
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:07,273
You have got to commit
to this affair once and for all...

1129
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:09,104
or you are doomed to fail.

1130
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:13,078
And if you fail at this affair...

1131
01:24:13,181 --> 01:24:15,081
you're gonna end up...

1132
01:24:15,183 --> 01:24:18,482
a lonely, old spinster.

1133
01:24:52,654 --> 01:24:54,519
It's me, Stella.

1134
01:24:54,622 --> 01:24:56,385
I have to talk to you.

1135
01:25:20,348 --> 01:25:22,248
Hurry. Hurry.

1136
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:53,643
Listen, Leo,
I'm no home-wrecker.

1137
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:59,146
Well, actually, that's not true,
but I don't want to wreck your home.

1138
01:25:59,287 --> 01:26:01,755
I like your wife too much.

1139
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:03,858
But I love you.

1140
01:26:08,463 --> 01:26:10,795
Anyway, the thing is...

1141
01:26:10,899 --> 01:26:15,336
Dr. Tremor thinks that maybe
we have a future together.

1142
01:26:15,436 --> 01:26:16,630
Who?

1143
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:20,401
Dr. Tremor, my therapist.

1144
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:29,651
Does it bother you
that I'm in therapy?

1145
01:26:29,651 --> 01:26:31,278
Okay! All right!

1146
01:26:31,386 --> 01:26:35,948
Why, why, why are you
fucking with my life?

1147
01:26:36,057 --> 01:26:37,718
I never laid a hand on her.

1148
01:26:37,825 --> 01:26:39,690
My life, my life!

1149
01:26:42,564 --> 01:26:45,260
First you start...

1150
01:26:45,366 --> 01:26:48,665
by telling my wife
to get me a girlfriend.

1151
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:50,738
Then you tell my girlfriend...

1152
01:26:50,838 --> 01:26:53,068
that we should have
an affair.

1153
01:26:53,174 --> 01:26:55,904
Meanwhile my wife finds out
about my girlfriend...

1154
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:57,773
only it's no go for her...

1155
01:26:57,912 --> 01:27:00,540
because she didn't handpick her!

1156
01:27:00,648 --> 01:27:04,015
And now she's giving me looks
with the meat cleaver!

1157
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:06,052
What did I ever do to you?

1158
01:27:06,154 --> 01:27:09,453
It's a very confusing world, Leo.
I'd be lying to tell you otherwise.

1159
01:27:09,557 --> 01:27:11,616
What's the problem?
Ten words or less.

1160
01:27:11,726 --> 01:27:15,685
Jesus Christ! I'm trying to hold on
to my marriage here.

1161
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:22,362
Did it ever occur to you that your wife
might want you to leave her?

1162
01:27:23,972 --> 01:27:25,667
Did it ever occur to you
that your wife...

1163
01:27:25,773 --> 01:27:28,264
might have found someone else?

1164
01:27:31,312 --> 01:27:34,042
My wife ain't having an affair.

1165
01:27:35,883 --> 01:27:38,784
- You never know.
- I know. I know.

1166
01:27:38,886 --> 01:27:41,252
You know why?
'Cause if she was...

1167
01:27:41,356 --> 01:27:44,519
I'd cut off his balls
with a carving knife.

1168
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:12,950
I apologize for the interruption.
Where were we?

1169
01:28:14,389 --> 01:28:17,290
What's on your mind, Doctor?
You can trust me.

1170
01:28:18,993 --> 01:28:23,293
I am having
a professional breakdown.

1171
01:28:30,038 --> 01:28:32,939
I have done something...

1172
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:35,134
unforgivable.

1173
01:28:36,511 --> 01:28:40,845
Alex, you've got to stop
thinking of yourself...

1174
01:28:40,948 --> 01:28:44,076
as responsible for
the fate of the world.

1175
01:28:44,185 --> 01:28:46,676
You're just a psychiatrist...

1176
01:28:46,788 --> 01:28:50,519
trying to muddle through
this twisted web of life.

1177
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:53,924
You're obviously experiencing
a stress-induced anxiety...

1178
01:28:54,028 --> 01:28:55,859
You know her too, don't you?

1179
01:28:58,366 --> 01:28:59,993
Know who?

1180
01:29:01,803 --> 01:29:04,397
The butcher's wife!

1181
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:28,793
Okay, okay.
Goodness gracious.

1182
01:29:28,896 --> 01:29:31,763
I'm glad you're here.
I have so many things to tell you.

1183
01:29:31,866 --> 01:29:35,131
This has to stop now.
My practice is in chaos.

1184
01:29:35,236 --> 01:29:39,935
My patients are out of control because
you are a psychiatrist's nightmare.

1185
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:42,009
No. You don't understand.
I figured it all out...

1186
01:29:42,143 --> 01:29:44,805
I take chaos
and turn it into order.

1187
01:29:44,946 --> 01:29:47,744
You take order
and turn it into a chaos...

1188
01:29:47,849 --> 01:29:49,544
that transcends chaos.

1189
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:51,208
Why? I'll tell you why.

1190
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:53,480
Because you are contagious.
That's why.

1191
01:29:53,588 --> 01:29:56,921
Everyone you touch
just goes berserk.

1192
01:29:57,024 --> 01:29:59,219
You're the only one
I see jumping around...

1193
01:29:59,327 --> 01:30:02,228
like a crazed jackrabbit.

1194
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:04,230
Alex Tremor, you love me.

1195
01:30:04,332 --> 01:30:05,594
No! No, no, no!

1196
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:07,565
Stop fighting it so hard.

1197
01:30:07,668 --> 01:30:10,068
Stop fighting it.

1198
01:30:10,171 --> 01:30:14,608
We're meant. It's destiny.
Why are you being so stubborn?

1199
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:16,676
I am just a doctor.

1200
01:30:16,811 --> 01:30:20,611
All I've wanted to do since I was
six years old is help people.

1201
01:30:20,715 --> 01:30:21,682
Me too.

1202
01:30:23,117 --> 01:30:25,312
- No. It's not the same.
- Oh, it is.

1203
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:28,856
We both help people,
just in our different ways.

1204
01:30:28,956 --> 01:30:31,948
Just when it comes to our
true feelings and desires, we're just...

1205
01:30:32,059 --> 01:30:33,856
too close to see clearly.

1206
01:30:35,897 --> 01:30:38,127
Marina...

1207
01:30:38,232 --> 01:30:41,531
please, no more
fairy tales, all right?

1208
01:30:41,636 --> 01:30:43,536
Can't you see how dangerous you are?

1209
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:49,804
You say that listening to your heart
and trusting what you feel...

1210
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:52,504
is that what you're calling dangerous?

1211
01:30:52,647 --> 01:30:55,616
You know what?
I hope I am contagious...

1212
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:59,311
'cause life isn't about
your damn books and theories.

1213
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:02,446
You know what? Life is life.
And it's messy...

1214
01:31:02,557 --> 01:31:05,082
and it's complicated
and it takes guts.

1215
01:31:05,193 --> 01:31:07,559
That's not something
you're gonna find in any book.

1216
01:31:07,662 --> 01:31:11,223
And just because you don't understand it
doesn't mean it's crazy.

1217
01:31:18,739 --> 01:31:21,606
No wonder everybody's
wandering around lost on this island.

1218
01:31:21,742 --> 01:31:23,642
They can't even smell the tides.

1219
01:31:23,744 --> 01:31:26,144
Here we go again...
the tides, the tides.

1220
01:31:26,247 --> 01:31:28,977
Can't you for once
deal with the problem at hand...

1221
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:30,846
instead of hiding behind
all this hoodoo voodoo...

1222
01:31:30,952 --> 01:31:33,079
Yes, I can. You know what?

1223
01:31:33,187 --> 01:31:34,620
You get out now.

1224
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:04,584
Out of my way, asshole!

1225
01:32:09,257 --> 01:32:10,918
Just ignore him.

1226
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:24,835
Honey, what are you doing?

1227
01:32:24,939 --> 01:32:26,668
I'm leaving.

1228
01:32:30,811 --> 01:32:34,406
- Where are you gonna go?
- Home.

1229
01:32:37,785 --> 01:32:40,481
I'm real sorry, Leo,
for all the mess.

1230
01:32:42,056 --> 01:32:44,718
I really thought we were
meant for each other.

1231
01:32:45,993 --> 01:32:47,722
Yeah.

1232
01:32:47,828 --> 01:32:49,693
Me too.

1233
01:32:51,933 --> 01:32:54,367
And you've been nothing
but sweet to me.

1234
01:32:57,338 --> 01:32:58,600
I just wanted...

1235
01:32:58,706 --> 01:33:01,732
so much to find somebody to love...

1236
01:33:03,177 --> 01:33:06,704
and be loved by that...

1237
01:33:06,847 --> 01:33:10,806
I guess I just jumped into that boat
so fast without thinking it through.

1238
01:33:14,455 --> 01:33:16,787
I wouldn't have had it
any other way.

1239
01:33:38,779 --> 01:33:42,078
Gracie, the sky is falling.

1240
01:33:42,183 --> 01:33:44,777
It's 2:00 in the morning, Alex.
Go home.

1241
01:33:44,885 --> 01:33:46,648
I know. I need to talk.

1242
01:33:46,754 --> 01:33:48,654
Yes, we do need to talk, Alex.

1243
01:33:48,756 --> 01:33:51,657
But you know what you need now?
You need sleep.

1244
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:56,992
Yeah. Can I stay here tonight?
I don't want to be alone.

1245
01:33:57,098 --> 01:33:59,896
It's not a convenient time
for me, Alex.

1246
01:34:00,001 --> 01:34:01,832
What? What?

1247
01:34:04,038 --> 01:34:05,801
I'm with somebody.

1248
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:14,240
Gracie, that's...

1249
01:34:14,382 --> 01:34:15,713
that's great.

1250
01:34:15,816 --> 01:34:19,946
- You may not think it's so great.
- Is everything all right, Gracie?

1251
01:34:24,425 --> 01:34:26,757
You've got Robyn in there.

1252
01:34:26,861 --> 01:34:28,522
I know that.

1253
01:34:34,902 --> 01:34:36,699
My career is a shambles...

1254
01:34:36,804 --> 01:34:40,638
and my best friend is sleeping
with my girlfriend.

1255
01:34:42,576 --> 01:34:43,838
Ain't love grand?

1256
01:34:45,012 --> 01:34:46,647
That's not gonna cut it.

1257
01:34:47,982 --> 01:34:49,973
We're happy.

1258
01:34:50,084 --> 01:34:51,984
Don't take it apart.

1259
01:34:58,426 --> 01:35:00,087
So...

1260
01:35:06,734 --> 01:35:09,498
I was the one who got her
that nightgown.

1261
01:35:09,603 --> 01:35:11,594
- Call me tomorrow.
- Me too.

1262
01:35:23,918 --> 01:35:27,183
<i>Gone is the romance</i>

1263
01:35:27,321 --> 01:35:31,257
<i>That was so divine</i>

1264
01:35:31,392 --> 01:35:33,451
<i>'Tis broken</i>

1265
01:35:33,594 --> 01:35:38,930
<i>And cannot be mended</i>

1266
01:35:40,267 --> 01:35:43,100
<i>You must go your way</i>

1267
01:35:43,204 --> 01:35:47,072
<i>And I must go mine</i>

1268
01:35:47,174 --> 01:35:50,769
<i>And now that our love dreams</i>

1269
01:35:51,712 --> 01:35:56,240
<i>Have ended</i>

1270
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:58,477
<i>What'll I do</i>

1271
01:35:58,619 --> 01:36:01,019
<i>When you</i>

1272
01:36:01,155 --> 01:36:04,556
<i>Are far away</i>

1273
01:36:04,692 --> 01:36:08,924
<i>And I am blue</i>

1274
01:36:09,029 --> 01:36:11,224
<i>What'll I do</i>

1275
01:36:13,868 --> 01:36:15,768
<i>What'll I do</i>

1276
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:22,070
<i>When I am wondering who</i>

1277
01:36:22,176 --> 01:36:26,044
<i>Is kissing you</i>

1278
01:36:26,147 --> 01:36:28,911
<i>What'll I do</i>

1279
01:36:31,485 --> 01:36:35,353
<i>What'll I do with just</i>

1280
01:36:35,456 --> 01:36:39,290
<i>A photograph</i>

1281
01:36:39,393 --> 01:36:46,458
<i>To tell my troubles to</i>

1282
01:36:48,169 --> 01:36:50,228
<i>When I'm alone</i>

1283
01:36:50,337 --> 01:36:56,242
<i>With only dreams of you</i>

1284
01:36:56,343 --> 01:37:00,677
<i>Dreams that won't come true</i>

1285
01:37:00,781 --> 01:37:03,306
<i>What'll I do</i>

1286
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:24,661
<i>When I'm alone</i>

1287
01:37:24,772 --> 01:37:30,904
<i>With only dreams of you</i>

1288
01:37:31,011 --> 01:37:35,345
<i>Dreams that won't come true</i>

1289
01:37:35,449 --> 01:37:38,907
<i>What'll I do</i>

1290
01:37:39,053 --> 01:37:42,216
<i>What will</i>

1291
01:37:42,356 --> 01:37:46,816
<i>I do</i>

1292
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:30,871
Grammy d'Arbo.

1293
01:38:30,971 --> 01:38:33,735
Yes.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1294
01:38:33,841 --> 01:38:36,207
I always wanted her
to marry a doctor.

1295
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:38,301
She's waiting on the lookout.

1296
01:38:41,282 --> 01:38:43,182
And I never read Plato.

1297
01:39:11,278 --> 01:39:15,237
Oh, it's a lonely world
without your split-apart.

1298
01:39:15,349 --> 01:39:16,976
I've always had a hard time
with mysteries...

1299
01:39:17,084 --> 01:39:19,552
and I've never been very good
with trust, but Marina...

1300
01:39:19,687 --> 01:39:22,178
I believe in you...

1301
01:39:22,323 --> 01:39:24,257
and I love you.
