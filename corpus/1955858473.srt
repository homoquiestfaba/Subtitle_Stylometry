1
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:19,745
There was a brilliant
way about Velouria.

2
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,146
She had a virginal quality

3
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:24,883
that contrasted her
ice cold outer shell.

4
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:29,288
Looking back, I realize that
I was the only one to notice.

5
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:32,124
Yeah, she was a bitch, for sure.

6
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:36,228
Her breasts, her cheekbones,
her legs.

7
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,297
She saw it all in the mirror
every morning

8
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:41,467
and was well aware
of the power held therein.

9
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:44,937
No one could touch her
or intimidate her.

10
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,306
She rarely looked
anyone in the eye.

11
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,676
I once saw Brad Dorsey,
captain of the soccer team,

12
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,478
crying by his locker.

13
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,981
She dumped him after one date
and took his balls with her.

14
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:59,952
From that day forward,
he never played sports again.

15
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:04,957
This was a prime example
of the witchery she cast.

16
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,927
But I wasn't attracted
to her pale beauty.

17
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:12,231
I was more turned on
by the little girl within.

18
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,133
It was this thought

19
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:16,435
that I masturbated to
every afternoon.

20
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,339
And not her thighs
or flat stomach.

21
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,142
I imagined her breaking down

22
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,077
and begging me
never to leave her

23
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:29,281
because I was the only one
who truly understood

24
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,817
the Velouria within.

25
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,618
And when I finished,

26
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:36,155
I looked at the small puddle
of cum I had generated

27
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,423
and wondered,

28
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,762
"Why did I just
waste this on a table top?"

29
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,735
Um, how old were you
when this story took place?

30
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,470
I was, um…

31
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,273
6th Grade.

32
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,174
- Ew.
- Sidney,

33
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,242
I asked the class
to write an essay

34
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,278
on the meaning of life.

35
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,747
I thought this was appropriate
for that topic.

36
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,015
Well, it's not.

37
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,784
It was highly inappropriate.

38
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,287
Well… Okay.

39
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:11,690
She's going to fail you.

40
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,659
I just hate her, you know.

41
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,594
Hey look, I don't like her
very much either

42
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,596
but it doesn't mean
she's a bad teacher.

43
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:20,632
- She had a book published.
- A romance novel.

44
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,870
But still, you're going
to have to figure out a way

45
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,005
to get a passing grade from her.

46
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,373
You better rewrite those essays.

47
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,608
You know what it is?

48
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,109
It's… It's her…

49
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,147
It's her limited definition
of 20th century writers.

50
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,882
What about… What about
Hunter S. Thompson?

51
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,818
What about David Foster
Wallace, you know?

52
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,153
William Gibson.

53
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,654
You know, someone contemporary.

54
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,156
Sidney.

55
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:47,226
I went to a meeting earlier
today and I fought for you.

56
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,660
But she thinks
you've targeted her,

57
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:51,464
and lets face it, she's right.

58
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,234
What if I wrote a novel?

59
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,768
No one's questioning
your ability.

60
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,972
It's your subject matter
that's getting you in trouble.

61
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,640
You know what
they would do to me

62
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:02,841
if I printed half the stories

63
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,111
you've submitted
for the school paper?

64
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,383
Okay.

65
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,120
Let's say you did write a novel.

66
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,223
What would it be about?

67
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,663
It's about

68
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,300
a suicide victim
from a small town.

69
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,105
Did you think when you wrote it

70
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:37,042
that it would go on to have
this kind of success?

71
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,845
No, I mean…
I didn't even know

72
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,980
I could make a living
off of it, honestly.

73
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:46,952
I… I was just hoping
that one person would buy it,

74
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,522
one person would
want to read it.

75
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,457
But millions
of people have bought it.

76
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,525
- Mmm-hmm.
- Millions.

77
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,094
Yeah.

78
00:04:55,461 --> 00:05:01,266
How do you follow up a book
like a suburban tragedy?

79
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:02,734
I can't think about it that way.

80
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,170
I just keep writing.

81
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:08,908
And when can we expect
your next book?

82
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,145
Soon.

83
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,713
Okay! You have
an 11:00 at Sushi Dan

84
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:15,814
with Porter House.

85
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,084
A 1:00
live interview with JNN,

86
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:22,054
Flight is at 5:00 and…

87
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,155
And?

88
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,791
Dr. Baum says you still
haven't contacted

89
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:26,958
the therapist you recommended

90
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,296
and that he will reschedule
the MRI again.

91
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,332
Thoughts, comments?

92
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,599
I'll do the MRI.

93
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,734
I'm not seeing a therapist.

94
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,036
I need a divorce attorney,
not a shrink.

95
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,304
How'd you feel
about the interview?

96
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,674
Oh, best one you've ever done.

97
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:44,510
You ready?

98
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:03,829
He didn't have a lot on him…

99
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,964
He just had a duffle bag.

100
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:11,036
I mean, he just had basically
everything he owned.

101
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,170
I asked him one time,

102
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:15,407
I asked him where he was headed.

103
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:18,111
And he looked at me…

104
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:21,580
And he just said, "May 25th."

105
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:24,517
That was it, it was May 25th.

106
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,460
He was a lunatic.

107
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:36,862
You could tell
just by looking at him.

108
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,697
He was ranting, raving.

109
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,666
Next thing you know, there's
a fire in the apartment.

110
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,001
What'd he look like?

111
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,670
I don't know, he was, uh…

112
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,873
Early mid-thirties, white.

113
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,107
Kinda filthy.

114
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,876
- Big beard.
- Big beard. Yeah.

115
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:54,146
Sunglasses. Kinda…
Yeah, he was obviously…

116
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:57,150
You could tell he was like
mentally, you know, slow.

117
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,030
What is your name?

118
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,433
Bauer, David Bauer.

119
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,568
Mr. Bauer.

120
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,004
Sit down.

121
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,687
Is this the man
that you were referring to?

122
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,924
Yeah. Yep, that's him.

123
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:42,394
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm positive.

124
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,795
Mr. Bauer.

125
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,531
Tell me if this sounds familiar.

126
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:52,371
A man walks into a store.

127
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:58,578
He's a drifter.
Modestly dressed.

128
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,913
He searches the establishment

129
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,549
for a certain section of books,

130
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,519
which contain
a particular literature

131
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,122
that he deems unreadable.

132
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,226
He takes these books.

133
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,432
Takes out a can
of lighter fluid.

134
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,076
Fire.

135
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:35,213
But he's not alone
when he does this.

136
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:36,482
There's a hound dog.

137
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:40,586
An old hound dog,
about this tall.

138
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,022
Did you happen to see this dog?

139
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,790
Well, it's against
library policy

140
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,058
to allow pets into the building,

141
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,326
so, no.

142
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,595
I wonder what he did
with the dog.

143
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,564
I don't know,
maybe he left it at home

144
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,065
like a normal person.

145
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,501
If he had a home, that would
be a wonderful option.

146
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,870
You have to excuse me for not
having a lot of sympathy

147
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,105
for a guy who walks in here

148
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,806
and burns books
in public places.

149
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,141
And neither do I.

150
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,911
However there is something
I know that you don't.

151
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,746
Yeah, what's that?

152
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,015
I know why he burned the books.

153
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,517
Why?

154
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,791
Because he wrote them.

155
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,432
Good day, Mr. Bauer.

156
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,215
Can I help you with something?

157
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,484
Uh, yeah, I need to talk to you.

158
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,153
Uh, If you're looking for a book

159
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,955
on how to please your woman,

160
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,891
the card catalog
is just over there.

161
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,160
Yeah.

162
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,105
I liked your essay
the other day.

163
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,708
Oh, yeah? Why?

164
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,743
Cause it was honest.

165
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:14,546
All the rest were bullshit,
but yours was honest.

166
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,615
Right.

167
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,483
We wouldn't be caught dead

168
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:21,386
talking to each other
in the halls.

169
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,089
Yet, here we are
for the very first time,

170
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,124
and you want to talk to me
about my homework?

171
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,361
It's a compliment, Hall.

172
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,462
And plus, that's not true.

173
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,697
We hung out once
in the 5th grade.

174
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:36,134
I was running away from home,
you lent me an extra bicycle.

175
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,202
You remember that?

176
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,737
Yeah, I remember that, dipshit.

177
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,739
We rode up to that hill
over by the winery.

178
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,307
That, um…

179
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,409
It's actually what
I'm here to talk about.

180
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,344
I'm surprised
you're bringing that up.

181
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,213
That was a really long time ago.

182
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,383
You remember what we did
when we got there?

183
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:54,220
You had a paper bag.

184
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:59,958
It was, uh, wrapped up in tape.

185
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,059
Right?

186
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,495
It was kinda bulky.

187
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,497
We buried it.

188
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,631
On Farmer's Peak.

189
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,233
You wouldn't tell me
what was in it.

190
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,336
Right. Well, I need it back.

191
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,571
What do you want me
to do about it?

192
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,407
Look, I don't know
that area, man, all right.

193
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,075
All the hills
look the same to me.

194
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,044
Never been back since.

195
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,112
Oh, you need my help.

196
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,448
Yeah.

197
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,017
Yeah, Hall. All right?

198
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,320
I need you help.
There, I said it.

199
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,959
I don't know, man. I mean…

200
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,528
The day after we hung out,

201
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,697
you pretended like
nothing ever happened.

202
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,834
I saw you in the halls,
you laughed in my face.

203
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,438
You were an asshole then.
You're an asshole now.

204
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:51,277
Tell me one good reason
why I should care.

205
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:55,815
You're right, forget it.

206
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,801
Oh, come on.

207
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,043
Please, please, don't throw
away my comic books.

208
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,212
Haven't you outgrown
those things?

209
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,747
Sorry, Dad. I got you.

210
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,816
What's next? You're gonna
throw away my CDs, my books,

211
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:32,952
everything in my room?

212
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,357
Hey, Dad, you want something
to read? I got a comic…

213
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,426
You have any ideas about
who you're taking to prom?

214
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,795
Not this one.
I'm not going to prom.

215
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,598
- How does that look?
- Why not?

216
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,166
Because it's a segregated ritual

217
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,268
wherein the unpopular people
are ostracized

218
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,804
- by the beautiful ones.
- Oh, my God.

219
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:57,242
Your father and I have great
memories from prom night.

220
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,611
Yeah. Me.

221
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,613
Get over it.

222
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,926
All right.

223
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,161
Brandi. Okay.

224
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,429
Hi.

225
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,266
Brandi.

226
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,902
There you go.

227
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,405
Uh, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Mr. Hall.

228
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,407
Hey. Uh, what's your name?

229
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,676
My name's Henry Crow.

230
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,412
I've read
your book so many times.

231
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:38,082
Um, it's really affected
the way I think about things.

232
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,350
Is that Crowe with an E?

233
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:40,786
- Yeah.
- An E, yeah.

234
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,423
I think I know
what I'm supposed to do now.

235
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,626
Sorry, what was that?

236
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,460
"The core of our nation

237
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:52,463
"is etched inside
these plastic smiles.

238
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,033
"And endless rows
of nowhere houses.

239
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,802
"This is how we live.

240
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,106
"It's also how we die."

241
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,837
Sidney?

242
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,839
Sorry for the wait.
Harold's ready for you.

243
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,275
Lawyers are only trouble.

244
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,310
Listen, I gotta go.

245
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,479
A great writer
has just entered the room.

246
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,914
All right, Love you.

247
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,216
Bye.

248
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,285
Sidney, my dear boy.

249
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,888
Don't take this the wrong way,

250
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,923
I say it as a friend.

251
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,324
You look like shit.

252
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:56,027
You look like one of those
lost children on milk cartons.

253
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,829
You've been number one
on The New York Times

254
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,631
best seller list
for eight months.

255
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,332
And still, no smile.

256
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,868
Please, tell me.
What ails you? What can I do?

257
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,937
I'm having
panic attacks, Harold.

258
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,273
That's good. All of my clients
have panic attacks.

259
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,842
Yeah, but you know,
none of your other clients

260
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,377
have my kind of pressures.

261
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,812
None of my other clients
have your kind of talent.

262
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:16,581
If you weren't
having panic attacks,

263
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,815
I'd be very worried.

264
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:19,117
No, it's…
It's different this time.

265
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,153
I'm seeing things.
Things that aren't there.

266
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,256
Like right now, it looks like
you're not wearing pants.

267
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,824
I'm not wearing pants.

268
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:29,027
Sidney, do you know
what I have in this folder?

269
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,028
No.

270
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,829
It's starts
with the letter "P."

271
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,266
- Protest letters?
- No. Not protest letters.

272
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,368
Christ, man!
You've got to get optimistic.

273
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:38,304
Forget about Montana.

274
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:41,205
Everything that
we have worked for.

275
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,408
Everything that we
have talked about

276
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,177
has come down to this.

277
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:47,947
Open it.

278
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,985
The Pulitzer Prize.

279
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:56,955
You're a finalist.

280
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,325
We find out the winner
later this month.

281
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:03,361
Good, you've heard of it.

282
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,863
Ugh.

283
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:05,898
Oh.

284
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,632
Whatever you want,

285
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,500
it's not as important as what
I'm doing right now.

286
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,735
Love you, bye bye.

287
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,437
My mother.

288
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:15,807
So, can I get a fucking smile
now or what?

289
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,042
This guy, Francis, uh, Bishop,

290
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,510
should I be worried about him?

291
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:22,780
Francis Bishop is the literary
equivalent of Valium.

292
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,816
Forget the other guys,
you're a shoo-in.

293
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,051
Prologue to Paris.

294
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,885
- That's a good title.
- No.

295
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,253
No, that's a bad title.

296
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,189
That's the worst title
since Gone With The Wind.

297
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,925
More importantly, I'm throwing
a big party tonight.

298
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,293
There's going to be women.

299
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:38,496
Alcohol.
Women drinking alcohol.

300
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,866
I don't do parties, Harold.
You know that.

301
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,736
Well, that's a damn shame.

302
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,271
Cause you're going to be
the guest of honor.

303
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:48,873
Even worse.

304
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:51,377
So, that's a yes?

305
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,064
It's late and I'm confused.

306
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,332
I'm confused about a boy

307
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,001
who writes the most
beautiful stories in his

308
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,370
school newspaper.

309
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,905
I read each one carefully

310
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,241
and paste it in my journal
when I'm done.

311
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,443
And then I think
about approaching him.

312
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,712
But quickly realize
that I'm not very good

313
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,347
at being social.

314
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:32,417
And he's clearly
not good at being social.

315
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,951
I guess I'd tell him that

316
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:37,021
he's the most talented person
I've never met…

317
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,724
But I have met him.

318
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,993
Maybe that was a dream.

319
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,129
Love, Melody.

320
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,968
I don't think anyone named
Melody goes to this school.

321
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,771
You know, Melody might not
even be her real name.

322
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:56,274
Do you recognize
the handwriting at all?

323
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,509
It's nice. It's very elegant.

324
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,246
I should only be so lucky
with my students.

325
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,049
What do you think?

326
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,685
I mean, what should I do?
Who is she?

327
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:10,154
Maybe you already met her.
Have you met anyone recently?

328
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,023
Not really, I mean…

329
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,025
I have to find her, though.

330
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,528
Oh, I have a great idea.

331
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:22,400
So you walk up to every girl
that crosses your path,

332
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,135
both inside and outside
of class…

333
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,804
- Yeah?
- And you shout…

334
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,673
"Melody!"

335
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,776
"Melody!"

336
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,545
See what happens.

337
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,750
That… That's it?
That's your advice?

338
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,019
Yup.

339
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,225
Seriously?

340
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,736
Melody?

341
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,606
Melody?

342
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,743
Hey, Melody?

343
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,212
Melody?

344
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,314
Melody.

345
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,383
Melody.

346
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,686
Uh, Melody? Melody? Melody?

347
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,155
Uh, Mel…

348
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,625
Melody? Melody?
Melody? Melody?

349
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,757
Uh, excuse me.

350
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,826
Pardon the announcement. Um…

351
00:19:55,827 --> 00:20:00,865
But would anyone named Melody

352
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,100
please report
to the front office.

353
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,403
I repeat, anyone named Melody,

354
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:08,673
uh, please report to the
front office immediately.

355
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:09,608
This is an urgent matter.

356
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:10,942
Um…

357
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,411
Anybody who writes under
the pseudonym, Melody, just…

358
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:16,481
Just come to the front…

359
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,061
Get outta here, you savages.

360
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,295
Go eat some hors d'oeuvres.

361
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:32,763
Feed on the blood of the young,

362
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:34,098
whatever it is you do.

363
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:37,368
Here, all the greats
drink whiskey.

364
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,436
That's a fact.

365
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,404
How soon before I can go?

366
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,441
It's like throwing a party
for Silvia Plath.

367
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,910
Come on, I have to talk
to you about something.

368
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,545
The Big P.

369
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,414
I need you to be
encouraged by it.

370
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,283
I want you to embrace it.

371
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,385
It means a lot
to a lot of people.

372
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:57,588
Not least of which,
should be you.

373
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,723
You deserve it.

374
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,124
Yeah, and what about Bishop?

375
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,525
He's a hack.

376
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:04,162
Guy writes six mediocre books.

377
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,098
All of a sudden,
he comes up with one

378
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,667
that people actually buy.
It's bullshit.

379
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,169
You need to get
your head straight.

380
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,604
Take a vacation.

381
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,673
Finish your second novel.

382
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,174
Get inspired.

383
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,743
It's hard,
I'm telling you, Harold.

384
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:21,212
It's hard to get inspired.

385
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:24,015
You want inspiration?
I'll give you inspiration.

386
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,750
- Ladies and gentlemen…
- No, don't…

387
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,251
Your attention, please.

388
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:31,722
Mr. Sidney Hall is a finalist
for the Pulitzer Prize.

389
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:34,625
Give it up
for Mr. Sidney Hall.

390
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:38,663
You had to do that, huh?

391
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:41,499
- You just had to do…
- That wasn't so bad, was it?

392
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,134
Listen, Sidney.

393
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,503
Whether you believe it or not,
I'm on your side.

394
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,872
I understand what
you're going through.

395
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,708
I've had three of the ugliest
divorces in American history

396
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,176
and I survived them all.

397
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:53,544
They're like enemas.

398
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:55,112
They're uncomfortable
and invasive,

399
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:57,315
but the next day
you feel like a new man.

400
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,817
You need to find
yourself a muse.

401
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,653
Loosen up, you know what I mean?

402
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,055
I'll round back to you in a bit.

403
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,825
Don't leave. I want you
to meet my daughter.

404
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,666
Hey, hey. Excuse me.

405
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,068
Yeah, um…

406
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,669
Could you…
Could you send this drink,

407
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,905
while you're there,
could you send it

408
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:23,974
over to that girl right there?

409
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,376
Black hair.

410
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:26,445
Thank you.

411
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,419
This is for you

412
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,521
from the gentleman
in the corner.

413
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,157
Right there.

414
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,179
You couldn't just walk 15 feet
and give it to me yourself?

415
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,883
You had to send it over
from a safe distance?

416
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,252
Is that part of the…

417
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:11,490
Sidney Hall mystique?

418
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,093
What's your name?

419
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:16,962
Alexandra.

420
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,563
If you don't wanna
take the drink,

421
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,500
I'll gladly take it from…

422
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:23,769
You.

423
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,338
Okay.

424
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,373
You have to leave
Lewis Chang alone.

425
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:37,875
I don't even want
to see you looking at him.

426
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:41,479
That goes for Greg and Pyat
and all the other goons.

427
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:44,348
What do you care about him for?

428
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,650
I mean, look at him,
he's asking for it.

429
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,321
I don't see him asking for it.

430
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,959
Fine. Whatever, Hall… Look.

431
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,126
You better shed
some serious light

432
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,695
on the situation
if I'm going to throw away

433
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:00,464
one of the few things I have
to look forward to every day.

434
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,601
Does that mean you'll stop?

435
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:05,871
Yeah, I'll stop.

436
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,706
But if he ever grows
enough balls

437
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:09,773
to start up with me,
I swear to God…

438
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:11,008
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah…

439
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,710
You'll shove his dick
up his ass or whatever.

440
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,279
He's not gonna start with you.

441
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,015
We have a deal?

442
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,417
I'll pick you up Saturday.

443
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,455
You live over in Cedar, right?

444
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,057
Yeah.

445
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,592
Across the tracks,

446
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,263
as my dad would say.

447
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,709
Dad?

448
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,345
Yeah.

449
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,317
Never mind.

450
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:39,464
No! No, no, wait!

451
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,886
Jameson.

452
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,255
Jameson.

453
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,270
Hello.

454
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,707
Hi. Hi, is this, uh, Melody?

455
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:34,452
Shit.

456
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,712
This guy is good.

457
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:05,150
This guy's really fucking good.

458
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:07,451
You, sir,

459
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,621
have been drinking
since I met you.

460
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:12,623
It's a very bad habit.

461
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:13,957
And incidentally, I'm getting

462
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,727
kinda tired of pretending like
we don't know each other

463
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,629
every time we go out in public.

464
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,230
I'm sorta married.

465
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:22,499
Are you sorta divorced?

466
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,735
Sorta separated?

467
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:27,905
You're Harold's daughter.

468
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:29,673
I think he can handle it.

469
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,742
You're his meal ticket, so…

470
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,278
Maybe today.

471
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:35,179
Okay.

472
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,849
I think you should take one
of these and some of this.

473
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,919
Gonna get some sleep, and then
tomorrow's going to happen…

474
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,987
I'm tired of sleeping.

475
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:45,689
My entire life,
I can't think of one

476
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:50,295
positive dreaming experience,
only nightmares.

477
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,930
Is there any
particular nightmare

478
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,799
that I can help you with?

479
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:02,039
Well there's this one,
recurring one.

480
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,774
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

481
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,643
Where I'm being followed.

482
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:14,651
Everywhere I go.
He's with me.

483
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:18,323
And I get claustrophobic.

484
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,860
Like he's

485
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,228
strangling me.

486
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:28,766
Like he knows all the bad
things that I've ever done.

487
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,735
And he's coming to judge me.

488
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,437
And when I wake up
from this nightmare,

489
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,440
he's still there.

490
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,378
I don't know what he wants.

491
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:44,349
But he knows
everything about me.

492
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:49,052
That's what scares me the most.

493
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:50,789
Good morning.

494
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:55,125
Mr. Tidemand.

495
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,563
I wonder if you
by chance know…

496
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,566
This man.

497
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:09,240
Have you seen him recently,
Mr. Tidemand?

498
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:14,211
I'd like you to take a good
long look at this mug shot

499
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:16,880
because it was taken
very recently.

500
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:19,016
Okay, so?

501
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:22,219
No one has claimed to see
or hear from Sidney Hall

502
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,354
in over five years.

503
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:27,291
And yet here he is, posing.

504
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,959
For New York City
Police Department.

505
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,495
Now how is that possible?

506
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,898
He was booked
under another name.

507
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:40,971
What do you want from me?

508
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,873
What I want to know,
Mr. Tidemand,

509
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:46,109
is if there are things
that you make,

510
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:49,514
other than these beautiful

511
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,251
wood trolls.

512
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,255
It's a trick.

513
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,158
What is?

514
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:03,160
I think you know
what I'm talking about.

515
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:05,028
I'm not after you,
Mr. Tidemand.

516
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,597
I'd like to offer you a trade.

517
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:09,666
You give me the information
about the documents you forged

518
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,034
for Sidney Hall.

519
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,469
And I give you my word,

520
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,506
you will never see me again.

521
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:19,810
All right,
but just so we're clear,

522
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,612
this conversation
is being recorded

523
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:23,281
on both sides of the table.

524
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:25,650
Fair enough.

525
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:41,231
…was here
a few months ago.

526
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,100
And?

527
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:43,734
I made him a couple ID's,

528
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,703
a passport
and a drivers license.

529
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:48,071
What else?

530
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,907
He didn't look good.

531
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:53,076
He said he had some
loose ends to tie up.

532
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,678
Did he say where he was going?

533
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,079
No, that's all I know.

534
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,252
Hey! Hey!

535
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:38,122
No crossing the street.

536
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,224
Okay.

537
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:41,693
Okay.

538
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,129
I just…

539
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:48,633
Is your name Melody?

540
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,138
Have we met before?

541
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,409
Yes.

542
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:00,511
We met.

543
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,981
When?

544
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,217
In the first grade.

545
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:10,787
You gave me a Valentines Day
card on the wrong day.

546
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,089
And then

547
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,926
on the actual Valentines Day,
you kissed me.

548
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,362
And I told on you.

549
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,998
And I would have kissed
you back, the next day…

550
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,635
But we moved. We went south
for a little bit.

551
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:27,772
Now you've moved back?

552
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:34,212
Why do you keep
running away from me?

553
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,283
I don't know.

554
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,087
Because it's fun.

555
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:45,490
Maybe I'm afraid.

556
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:49,159
- Afraid of what?
- Uh! No crossing the street.

557
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,894
All right. All right, I won't.

558
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,230
I just…

559
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:57,235
When can I cross the street?

560
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:31,768
What the fuck you doing, Hall?

561
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:34,204
I was having a moment.

562
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:35,672
Until you showed up.

563
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:36,774
Well, come on, let's go.

564
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,246
You wanna smoke?

565
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,382
No.

566
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,489
What's that, a journal?

567
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:53,157
Yup.

568
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:55,092
How long you kept one of those?

569
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,161
Since I was five.

570
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:02,532
You know, I wasn't
lying to you before.

571
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:03,868
About the essay.

572
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:06,336
I loved that shit, man.

573
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:08,138
All that stuff you rant about

574
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:11,141
in the school paper,
shit makes me laugh.

575
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,210
You should write about me.

576
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,780
Oh, yeah? What would
that be about?

577
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:17,815
My father.

578
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:20,884
Your father? What about him?

579
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:22,653
You know who my father is?

580
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:25,490
Yeah, he's a… He's a judge.

581
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:29,593
So what, doesn't mean I should
write a book about him.

582
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:31,896
Doesn't make you any
more interesting either.

583
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,237
Whatever, man.

584
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,608
You'll be singing
a different tune tomorrow.

585
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:48,646
What happens tomorrow?

586
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,904
May I come in?

587
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,572
Yeah.

588
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:16,473
Your elevator's stuck again.

589
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,074
Oh, Duane,

590
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:20,178
it's 6:00 in the morning.

591
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:22,746
Not in Oklahoma.

592
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,080
Great.

593
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:26,316
"The night served
as a tragic setting

594
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:27,752
"in the town of Oklahoma City

595
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:31,354
"where an aspiring writer,
Henry Crowe,

596
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,391
"committed suicide
in front of his parents.

597
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:36,793
"After a failed attempt
to kill his step-father

598
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:37,895
"with a 9mm handgun,

599
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,031
"he turned the gun on himself

600
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,300
- and shot himself in the head."
- I don't understand.

601
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:45,468
"The only thing found
on his person

602
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:48,238
"was a paperback copy
of Suburban Tragedy

603
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,474
"by renowned author,
Sidney Hall.

604
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:56,713
"He owned no less than
eight copies of the novel

605
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,081
"and according to friends,

606
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:00,284
"often quoted passages
from the book.

607
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:04,321
"Henry Crowe is one of
many in a growing allegiance

608
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,523
"of Suburban Tragedy followers

609
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:07,757
"who take the book so literally

610
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:10,493
"that they will attempt
to mimic its message

611
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:13,163
"and expose the underbelly
of Suburban America

612
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:14,965
"no matter what the cost.

613
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:20,470
"The book has already been
banned in school libraries

614
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,607
"and teaching curriculums
in Montana.

615
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:25,508
"And this incident
will undoubtedly

616
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:27,878
"spiral its resistance upwards,

617
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,983
"Possibly at
a national level."

618
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:38,956
How young was he?

619
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:43,427
- It doesn't make a difference.
- How young was he?

620
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:47,498
Twenty-two.

621
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,137
This book
has inspired more people

622
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:55,438
than you can possibly…

623
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,874
Inspired people to do what?
Kill themselves?

624
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:01,444
Whatever happens over
the next few weeks,

625
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,746
this is not your fault.

626
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,481
They'll make it my fault.

627
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:06,583
Maybe.
For a news cycle, but…

628
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,418
You don't read
the Internet anyway, okay,

629
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,888
so just… Just continue that.

630
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:13,958
Continue that, all right?

631
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,712
Now, this book

632
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:38,615
is essentially feeding our youth

633
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,650
a dangerously blind idealism.

634
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,218
Promoting disrespect
for our elders.

635
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:44,487
A generation
bred on entitlement.

636
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,789
And the fact
that it's being included

637
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,290
in our school curriculum

638
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,859
is a dangerous sign
of the times.

639
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,595
How do you feel about
the book burnings in Oklahoma?

640
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:54,998
Well, you have to buy 'em
in order to burn'em.

641
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,933
So, maybe sales will go up.

642
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:58,636
Next?

643
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,371
Any validity in the comparisons

644
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:02,539
between Henry Crowe

645
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,174
and the lead character
in Mr. Hall's book?

646
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,742
No. No. No.
The character in question

647
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:08,178
kills himself with a knife.
Not a gun.

648
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,447
And any comparison
between the two

649
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,082
is ridiculous horseshit.

650
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,283
- Next.
- Do you think this book

651
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,185
will become federally censored?

652
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,520
And might it have an effect
on the Pulitzer nomination?

653
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:21,391
I highly doubt that it
will be taken seriously.

654
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:22,759
And I couldn't care less about

655
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,528
Senator Dale's
campaign for fascism.

656
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,664
If he doesn't like the book,
don't read it.

657
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:28,765
Do you think he's read it?

658
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,266
I really don't give a shit.

659
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:31,902
But don't quote me on that.

660
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:34,237
But enough about me,

661
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:37,140
at this time, Sidney would
like to make a statement.

662
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:38,575
Please hold
all of your questions

663
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,777
until after he's finished.

664
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,989
It saddens me
that a life has been lost.

665
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,125
My heart goes out

666
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,661
to Henry Crowe's
family and friends.

667
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,699
I empathize with them,

668
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:07,103
and hope that brighter days
will appear sooner

669
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:08,939
rather than later.

670
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,476
That said…

671
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:15,479
I apologize for nothing.

672
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:21,185
I cannot predict

673
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,120
what reaction
any particular individual

674
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:28,893
may or may not have
to something I have written.

675
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:34,297
Nor can I live in fear,
or restraint

676
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:38,769
anytime I write a word
on a page.

677
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:41,004
I can only hope

678
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:44,040
that in time, the books I write

679
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:47,378
will have a positive impact.

680
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:52,917
It is sickening

681
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,854
to see that some congressmen
are using this boy's family

682
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:02,426
during their time of grief
for political gain.

683
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:05,229
It's shameful.

684
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,606
Furthermore, um…

685
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:18,509
I'm sorry…

686
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,045
Furthermore…

687
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,018
- I'm so sorry.
- Are you all right?

688
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:31,020
Uh, that will be all,
ladies and gentlemen.

689
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:32,890
Thank you all for coming.

690
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:40,763
There is some
evidence of scar tissue

691
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,332
on the side of your brain.

692
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,701
I think you're having
partial seizures

693
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,102
It could be from trauma.

694
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:48,938
Could be the result
of a serious blow to the head.

695
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:51,308
Has anything like that
ever happened to you?

696
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:53,544
Last week,

697
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:56,913
you called me, you claimed to be

698
00:41:56,914 --> 00:42:01,018
seeing things "outside
the realm of reality."

699
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,286
Hallucinations.

700
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,223
Are you still experiencing
these aberrations?

701
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:19,235
I'm… I'm sorry,
I have to go

702
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:21,038
Sidney there's medication
you can take.

703
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,063
Hey, Hall,

704
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,732
I don't have all day.

705
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:53,436
Look man,
you don't have to tell me

706
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:54,571
whatever's in the box

707
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,739
It's fine, it's your right.

708
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,675
I would like a little gratitude.

709
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,343
You want something else, Hall?

710
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:02,078
The Lewis Chang deal
ain't enough for you?

711
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,846
No, no, that's not
what I'm saying.

712
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:06,584
I just don't like
being treated like shit.

713
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:10,654
You like Melody Jameson.

714
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:14,524
I saw you talking to her
in the street.

715
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:18,528
Yeah dude, she's
my little sister's friend.

716
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:21,064
What's she like?
What's she interested in?

717
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:22,732
Is she… Is she cool?
Does she read?

718
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:24,100
Does she read?

719
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,135
Yeah, she's
"Hooked on Phonics."

720
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:27,870
Dude, I don't
fucking know, Hall.

721
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,073
Jesus Christ, I'm not
into girls who like…

722
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:32,643
Long walks on the beach
and all that shit.

723
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,979
I mean, I could
introduce you to her.

724
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,680
If you're having trouble.

725
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:38,482
I'm not having trouble.

726
00:43:38,483 --> 00:43:39,949
Oh, yeah.

727
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:43,219
Yeah, right. You really sealed
the deal in the street there.

728
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,121
God knows you're too pussy
to ask her out,

729
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,724
I might as well do it for you.

730
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:51,394
All right,
out of sheer curiosity,

731
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:53,463
what would you do?

732
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,665
Uh…

733
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,201
My sister's birthday
is this coming weekend

734
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:00,003
I can take her
to the fairgrounds

735
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:01,170
for ice cream or something

736
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:03,206
Coax Melody to tag along.

737
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:06,110
And you can show up
out of the blue and boom.

738
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:09,912
Next weekend, right?

739
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:11,215
Yeah.

740
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:12,949
So?

741
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,452
Think you can grow a dick
and a pair of balls by then?

742
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:19,956
Not that it'd matter anyway.
She's as prude as they come.

743
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:22,493
It'd take a crowbar
to get those legs open.

744
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,699
All right, thanks again man.

745
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,172
Oh, shit. Um…

746
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:39,176
Here, hide this.
Now. Go.

747
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,180
- Now.
- Yeah. Yeah, okay.

748
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:47,384
What are you doing here?

749
00:44:47,385 --> 00:44:48,851
Your sister told me
where you were.

750
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,787
The question is,
what are you doing here?

751
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:51,522
Hanging out with a friend.

752
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,891
Your mother has been
worried about you all day.

753
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:56,159
She called the goddamn police.

754
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,527
Overreact much?

755
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,095
Get out of the car!

756
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:00,530
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

757
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,898
I'm just
hanging out with a friend.

758
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,132
You are driving home with me.

759
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:04,401
Say goodbye to your friend.

760
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:06,969
Hey, I gotta go, man.

761
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,971
I'll, uh… I'll come back
for the car later.

762
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:10,339
- Come on.
- Yeah, that's cool.

763
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,175
Remember, Hall.
You hold the key.

764
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:14,844
All right.
You hold the key.

765
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:16,079
You hold the key.

766
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,782
You can hold this fucking key.
Get in the car.

767
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,252
Oh.

768
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,654
Okay. All right.

769
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,022
You're a peeping Tom.

770
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:01,290
You're a stalker.

771
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:03,160
A peeping tom-stalker.

772
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,179
Sidney, what are you doing?

773
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,216
Are you really going
to depend on Brett Newport?

774
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:22,071
I'm riding the Limited Express.

775
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:24,373
One of the crack trains
of the nation.

776
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:29,779
Hurtling across the prairie
into blue haze and dark air

777
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:34,784
go 15 all-steel coaches
holding a thousand people.

778
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:37,153
I read a story he did
in the fifth grade

779
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:39,322
about his dying grandfather.

780
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:41,457
And it was raw, but articulate.

781
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:42,526
It was…

782
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:44,862
Brilliant.

783
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,164
And I thought he plagiarized it.

784
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:49,765
And what did you do?

785
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:51,300
I had him stay after class

786
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:53,236
and I confronted him about it.

787
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:54,737
I told him, he couldn't possibly

788
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:56,272
have written that story.

789
00:47:56,273 --> 00:48:00,042
And I wanted to know
where he copied it from.

790
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,378
And you know what he said?

791
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:04,648
He said, "I'll take that
as a compliment."

792
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:08,352
And then, he ran out
to catch the bus.

793
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:12,388
Now, that's the thing
about Sidney.

794
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,857
You become a fan, first.

795
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:16,926
And then, you spend
the rest of your life

796
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:19,195
trying to become a friend.

797
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:20,998
I have a theory

798
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:25,635
that he's been burning copies
of his books

799
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:30,139
in libraries and bookstores
across the country.

800
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,807
Why is that funny?

801
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:32,676
Sidney was a purist.

802
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:37,313
He never went online
or anything like that.

803
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:39,448
So, there's a world
where he may actually believe

804
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:43,586
that he could burn
all his books in existence.

805
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,355
Let me show you something.

806
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:51,360
He nearly burned down
the west wing of a library

807
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:53,597
a few weeks ago, in the city.

808
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:56,699
Someone fitting his description

809
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,868
was then seen in Harrisburg.

810
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:00,436
On a freight train.

811
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:01,971
Then West Virginia

812
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:05,308
And then a similar store fire
in Oklahoma city.

813
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:08,110
Each time, moving further west.

814
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,547
Does that mean anything to you?

815
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:42,879
Want some dinner?

816
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:27,356
It's for you.

817
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,557
No, no, not now.

818
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:30,292
It's a girl.

819
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:31,394
A girl?

820
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:33,630
Someone named Melanie.

821
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:35,364
Melody?

822
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,432
Uh, give it to me.
Give it to me.

823
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:37,733
- You know her?
- Yeah, I do.

824
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:39,102
- Do you go to school with her?
- Yeah.

825
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:45,474
Hi.

826
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:47,510
How do I accidentally
meet you tonight

827
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:49,678
if you don't show up
to the fair?

828
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:52,615
I thought it was too contrived.

829
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:55,484
Look, I know
I've been stand-offish

830
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:58,187
but I'm the one who wrote you
in the first place.

831
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:00,289
So don't be such a wuss.

832
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,224
Okay, well.

833
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,060
Where should we meet?

834
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,796
Outside your front door.

835
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:32,855
Aren't I supposed to be
the one giving you the flower?

836
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:34,190
Normally, yes.

837
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:36,425
But since I wear the pants
in this relationship,

838
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,028
it's the other way round.

839
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:40,830
So, how we getting there?

840
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:43,332
Are we talking your…
Your parents' car?

841
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:44,967
- Shh!
- What?

842
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:48,504
What? Why am I shh?
Why do you want me to shh?

843
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:51,507
- Push it.
- Push the car? Um…

844
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:53,442
Why don't we just
start the ignition?

845
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,578
- That's what people do.
- Shh. Just do as you're told.

846
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:57,113
Oh. Oh, we're stealing it.
We're stealing it.

847
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,949
We're borrowing
with the intent to return.

848
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,051
That's stealing.
That's still stealing.

849
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:03,152
Hop in.

850
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:04,888
Hop in?
What do you mean, hop in?

851
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:07,958
Okay.

852
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:12,294
It's okay…

853
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:16,399
Don't you think you should
turn on the lights?

854
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:20,970
Do you like it?

855
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:26,242
No, this is like the worst
sundae I think I've ever had.

856
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:27,610
It tastes like tape.

857
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,178
Tape. Yeah.

858
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:31,714
I used to chew on tape
when I was little.

859
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:33,315
Ew. Yeah.

860
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:37,687
Let's just throw the tape
ice cream in the trash.

861
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:41,824
So, uh…

862
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,592
So, tell me…
Tell me, um…

863
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:46,095
How do you know
about my short stories

864
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:48,264
if you don't even
go to my school.

865
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:50,566
Is that like a thing you do?

866
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:53,235
Read all the school
newspapers in the county?

867
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:54,804
I get them from Darcy.

868
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,140
- I keep tabs on ya.
- Hmm.

869
00:52:58,141 --> 00:52:59,742
Aspirations?

870
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:01,510
Inspirations?

871
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:02,778
Photography.

872
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:04,146
I love Annie Leibovitz.

873
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:06,148
She's like my hero.

874
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:08,785
Um, I love Bob Dylan.

875
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,987
I love horror movies.

876
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:13,889
You sure you're girl?

877
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:19,962
Um, old Atari games
and traveling everywhere.

878
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:21,163
You?

879
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:25,801
Uh, that's a tough list
to follow up.

880
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:33,008
I guess I've really just been
writing, reading, all my life.

881
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,679
I wanna write a novel.

882
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:39,683
Something that's going
to shake people up.

883
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:44,253
Well, if you wanna write
a book worthwhile,

884
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:47,022
you have to see the world.

885
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:48,992
Have experiences, right?

886
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:52,696
Yeah.

887
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,072
You should get on that, Sidney.

888
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:06,075
Be sure to take me with you too.

889
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,544
Okay.

890
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:09,846
Let's win something.

891
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:13,516
Hey, can we play?

892
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,054
You ever played this before?

893
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:19,923
No.

894
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:22,958
- I'm really competitive.
- Oh, oh!

895
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:25,394
Okay. All right.

896
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:27,330
Mine's not going.
Mine's not going.

897
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,402
All right.

898
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:34,704
I win.

899
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:36,906
Thank you.

900
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:44,814
Could I actually
have one of those?

901
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:51,453
It's not a prize, mind you.

902
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,657
But you're welcome
to have a look.

903
00:54:58,161 --> 00:55:00,130
Johan Tidemand.

904
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:05,735
It's kinda beautiful.

905
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,371
Hey, Melody.

906
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,339
Can I, um,

907
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,875
talk to you?

908
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,111
You make these yourself?

909
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:17,579
From time to time.

910
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:20,683
It's a little hobby of mine,
when I travel.

911
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:24,153
How much, uh…
How would you want for this?

912
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,056
Listen, I only have, uh…

913
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:28,792
Keep it.

914
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,061
Thanks.

915
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:33,662
You're welcome.

916
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,098
Hey, Hall.

917
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:39,936
Hey, man.

918
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,104
Where you been all week?

919
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:44,174
I was… I was sick, dude.

920
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:17,272
Hey, so, um…

921
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:20,809
You still…
You still have that thing?

922
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:26,182
Yeah, I can bring it to the
finals on Monday if you want?

923
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,657
How's it going?

924
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:36,625
What do you mean?

925
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:38,895
You know what I mean.

926
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:42,565
Come on.

927
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,868
I'm gonna marry him.

928
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:14,798
So this is it?

929
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:16,766
Guess so.

930
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:21,837
Please, don't leave.

931
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:23,539
There's no room
for me here anymore.

932
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,340
I don't know what that means.

933
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:28,310
It means when I'm with you,
I don't feel like a person.

934
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:30,579
I feel like Sidney Hall's wife.

935
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:32,247
That's not true, Mel.

936
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:33,683
It is true.

937
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:37,786
When I'm with you,
it's just all about you.

938
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:42,024
Either your sad or depressed
or jealous or angry.

939
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:43,659
And those just aren't
attractive qualities

940
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:46,061
in case you wanted to know.

941
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:47,496
Mel, you're leaving me.

942
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:49,198
I just lost the Pulitzer
to Bishop,

943
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:51,800
a kid killed himself because
of something I wrote…

944
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:54,303
How am I supposed
to feel right now? Huh?

945
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,671
- See?
- What?

946
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:57,272
- It's all about you again.
- How am I supposed to feel?

947
00:57:57,273 --> 00:58:01,343
That kid didn't kill himself
because of you, or for you.

948
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:02,678
He killed himself for the cause.

949
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:03,912
You're not going to take the…

950
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:06,282
Which left you
a really long time ago.

951
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,686
Where are you staying?
Where are you staying?

952
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:13,656
There's nobody else,
if that's what you're asking.

953
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:18,228
Please, stay tonight.

954
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,731
Stay tomorrow?

955
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:27,769
Yeah?

956
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:29,538
Hey, you weren't
at the party last night.

957
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:31,540
I thought we were
supposed to meet up.

958
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:33,175
Listen, Alexandra.

959
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,710
Sidney,
I've been doing some thinking.

960
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:37,881
And, I think we should
become more serious.

961
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:51,060
What does that mean?

962
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:54,730
Means that, what we're doing
is fun but…

963
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:56,833
But I know it's not long-term.

964
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,836
I can't do that and you know it.

965
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:02,705
I want to fall
in love with you, Sidney.

966
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:05,707
Please, don't.

967
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,277
I think I already am.

968
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:12,114
Well, when you are finished

969
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:14,250
falling in love with me,

970
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:18,955
you know where the door is.

971
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:21,824
Are you for fucking…

972
00:59:41,044 --> 00:59:42,111
Melody?

973
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:45,315
No, Gina. Remember?

974
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:49,852
Personal assistant who
you haven't called in a week?

975
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:53,322
Melody.

976
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:54,957
Drink this.

977
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:56,292
Come on.

978
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,802
Well, looks like
someone's been busy.

979
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:08,904
It's just words.

980
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:12,941
By the looks of it,
enough here for ten books.

981
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:18,447
Problem is, there's
only ten pages worth reading.

982
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,817
Okay. Which ten?

983
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:23,619
Doesn't matter which ten.

984
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,355
It's all just

985
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:30,425
first pages and first sentences.

986
01:00:30,426 --> 01:00:32,127
There's no middle.

987
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,096
There's no end.

988
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:37,466
Characters keep switching
their identities.

989
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,768
Wish I could tell you

990
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:42,504
there's life and death

991
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:43,906
and plot twists.

992
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:51,313
And three generations
of richly drawn characters…

993
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:55,584
And hope, and courage.

994
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:57,487
Regrets.

995
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,558
But it's just one long,

996
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:06,595
intoxicating
masturbation session

997
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:09,766
with no climax.

998
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:12,968
When am I going to climax?

999
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:15,437
Okay, let's get you
to bed, all right?

1000
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:17,472
When was the last time
you slept?

1001
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:19,408
I need you to do me a favor.

1002
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:21,811
All right? Burn 'em.

1003
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:24,446
What?

1004
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:25,515
Burn 'em.

1005
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,650
Sidney, I'm not
burning your book.

1006
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:29,751
Just burn 'em.

1007
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:31,253
Okay, you're being drunk
and pretentious

1008
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:33,488
and I'm going to slap you
in the face.

1009
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:36,825
People work their entire lives

1010
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:40,662
in this industry,
just to get a taste

1011
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:42,164
of your praise and accolades.

1012
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:44,500
You just want
to throw that away?

1013
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:47,669
I'm not doing it.

1014
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:49,172
Fine.

1015
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:51,474
I'll just do it myself.

1016
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,684
- Okay.
- Fire…

1017
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:05,588
Fuck. Jesus.

1018
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:21,236
Good morning, students.

1019
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:25,674
This is the principal speaking.

1020
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:27,576
I have very sad news.

1021
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,045
A student here at Aubrey Field,

1022
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:33,249
Brett Newport,
passed away last night.

1023
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,018
His cause of death
is unknown at this time.

1024
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:40,956
But he was a good student
and a great athlete.

1025
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:42,924
I would like
to extend condolences

1026
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:46,027
on behalf of myself
and the school faculty,

1027
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:48,563
to his friends and family,

1028
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:50,132
and I would like to ask everyone

1029
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:53,870
if they could please rise
for a moment of silence.

1030
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:03,479
I wish I could have been there.

1031
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:07,415
Just five minutes
before he did it.

1032
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:10,152
I would have shaken him
and just said,

1033
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:12,321
"You have your whole life
ahead of you."

1034
01:03:14,223 --> 01:03:17,093
The good things
outweigh the bad.

1035
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:21,631
That's just not true
for some people.

1036
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:24,466
I always felt
like there was something

1037
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,669
going on in Darcy's house.

1038
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:30,373
Just something a little off.

1039
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:34,210
Secrets, you know?

1040
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,046
I've got to get out of here.

1041
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:40,515
I'll go with you.

1042
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:42,851
No, no, I mean, like…

1043
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:45,821
Like I gotta get out of here.

1044
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,257
Yeah. Me too.

1045
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:52,861
Really?

1046
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:54,496
Yeah, really.

1047
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,798
My parents said
they'd give me the old Pacer

1048
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,634
so we can leave
after the school year.

1049
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:01,970
Where would we go?

1050
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:03,472
We can just go west.

1051
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:08,643
Just… Just go west?
I mean, just…

1052
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:11,080
I found this thing the other
day, in a magazine.

1053
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:14,150
Here, I tore it out.

1054
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,018
It's really cool, though.

1055
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,521
Don't you think?

1056
01:04:19,488 --> 01:04:20,488
Yeah.

1057
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:21,990
It's in the middle of nowhere.

1058
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:25,728
The sky is like really blue.
It's not all polluted.

1059
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:30,866
Where is it?

1060
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,534
I don't know.

1061
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,269
It's somewhere
in the Western Hemisphere.

1062
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:36,439
Well, that narrows it down.

1063
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,274
No, but really,

1064
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:42,143
seriously, we're gonna
go here one day.

1065
01:04:42,144 --> 01:04:45,214
When we're old. Like 30.

1066
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:48,650
And it'll be on this date.

1067
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:49,818
What's today?

1068
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:51,586
May…

1069
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:55,690
- Okay, okay, so on May 25th…
- Mmm-hmm.

1070
01:04:55,691 --> 01:04:57,692
…when we're 30 years old,

1071
01:04:57,693 --> 01:05:00,095
we'll go to this house.

1072
01:05:00,096 --> 01:05:01,963
And sleep on the lay of the land

1073
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:04,000
until the sun rises.

1074
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:09,738
And we'll bathe
in desert hot springs

1075
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:12,440
before a tortoise attacks us.

1076
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:15,611
What if we're not
together anymore.

1077
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:19,614
We'll be together.

1078
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:21,716
I mean, of course,
we're going to be together.

1079
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:22,918
It doesn't matter.

1080
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,086
Even if we're not
together anymore.

1081
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:27,322
Even if we have
different families.

1082
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:28,291
Other lives.

1083
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:31,760
We just have
this one night together.

1084
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,262
It's our night.

1085
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:37,499
And what happens in the desert

1086
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,934
stays in the desert

1087
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,569
But we still don't know
where it is.

1088
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:43,739
That's just a small detail.

1089
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,309
Anyways,
it's all about beginnings.

1090
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:50,313
And you already
have a beginning.

1091
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:52,715
Yeah? What's that?

1092
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:57,252
Well, you want to write
a novel, don't you?

1093
01:05:57,253 --> 01:05:58,554
Yeah.

1094
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:01,757
Well, how about this?

1095
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,327
A high-profile judge's son

1096
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:08,630
kills himself in front
of the fam.

1097
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,799
And you might have been
one of the last people

1098
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,601
to see him alive.

1099
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:19,874
If that's not a beginning
to a great book,

1100
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:22,278
I don't know what is.

1101
01:07:14,397 --> 01:07:15,897
No.

1102
01:07:15,898 --> 01:07:17,466
Stay.

1103
01:07:22,738 --> 01:07:24,039
Shit.

1104
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,642
Oh, shit. Come on.

1105
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:29,811
- Sir.
- Yeah, we're good.

1106
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:31,546
- Sir.
- Thank you. I'm good.

1107
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,448
Sir, I need you
to stay right there.

1108
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:34,583
Yeah.

1109
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:37,419
I got you.

1110
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,354
Step back to the car for me.

1111
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:41,489
Is there any way
I can get a lift somewhere?

1112
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:44,159
Sir, we're not a taxi.
We're arresting you.

1113
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,493
Open container.

1114
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:48,730
I was just laying down there,
that's not even mine.

1115
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:49,931
Ow!

1116
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:51,299
It's all right, Homer.

1117
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,701
What are you going
to do with my dog?

1118
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:55,637
Animal control is going
to take care of him.

1119
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:57,806
Please don't hurt my dog.

1120
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:00,408
- Please.
- Watch your head.

1121
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:03,546
Please don't… Ow!
Please don't hurt my dog.

1122
01:08:05,548 --> 01:08:07,715
Roger
that, bringing him around now.

1123
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:12,420
Haven't seen this one before.
His name is Brett Newport.

1124
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:17,192
It's a New York ID.
953383.

1125
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:21,897
That's Brett Newport.
953383.

1126
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:06,674
Good evening, ma'am.

1127
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:08,776
My name is Duane Jones.
I teach English

1128
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:10,545
at the high school.

1129
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:11,614
Something wrong?

1130
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:14,048
Oh, no. No, no.

1131
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:15,383
Not at all.
As a matter of fact,

1132
01:09:15,384 --> 01:09:17,752
Sidney's one of our
brightest students.

1133
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:20,622
I was wondering
if I could speak with him.

1134
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:23,025
Make it quick.
He's grounded.

1135
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:33,067
Well, I'm not
getting any younger.

1136
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:36,404
I almost got in an accident
on Route 9

1137
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:38,072
because my mind
was so scattered.

1138
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:39,874
And I was…

1139
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:41,977
I was thinking about you and
all the trouble you get me in.

1140
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:45,514
I hope you appreciate it.

1141
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:50,218
Why didn't you tell me
you started writing a book?

1142
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:51,686
Oh, I don't know.

1143
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:55,423
It's just something
I was working on.

1144
01:09:55,424 --> 01:09:57,693
I thought I'd ask you…

1145
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:00,428
I was curious about your…

1146
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:01,830
Your thoughts on it.

1147
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:05,867
Well, I've read
what you have this far.

1148
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:09,371
And I thought it was…

1149
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:13,709
Manipulative.

1150
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:17,245
It manipulated me
through the first chapter.

1151
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:20,416
It forced me through the second.

1152
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:24,486
It dared me to reach the third.

1153
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,055
It was honest.

1154
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:28,891
Personal. Valid.

1155
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:30,926
I loved it.

1156
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:33,428
I wanna know what happens next.

1157
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:35,363
- You do?
- Yeah.

1158
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:38,466
Of course, your choice
of subject matter

1159
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:41,670
is… It's a bit
controversial.

1160
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:44,505
And as brilliant
as the pages are right now,

1161
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:45,873
you're gonna get
some heavy criticism

1162
01:10:45,874 --> 01:10:47,342
for it down the road.

1163
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:50,111
Down the road?
What do you mean?

1164
01:10:50,112 --> 01:10:50,846
Uh…

1165
01:10:50,847 --> 01:10:55,984
I took it upon myself
to send your pages out

1166
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:58,553
to some friends of mine

1167
01:10:58,554 --> 01:11:02,024
who are in
the publishing business.

1168
01:11:03,292 --> 01:11:07,996
Um, but did anyone respond?

1169
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:09,398
Yes.

1170
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:11,133
Uh, who?

1171
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:13,435
Porter House.

1172
01:11:14,803 --> 01:11:15,937
Porter House?

1173
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,071
Mmm-hmm.

1174
01:11:17,072 --> 01:11:19,207
What did they say?

1175
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:20,976
They said it was strong.

1176
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:24,345
They want to meet with you
as soon as possible.

1177
01:11:24,346 --> 01:11:25,781
There could be money involved.

1178
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:28,816
- Really?
- Yeah,

1179
01:11:28,817 --> 01:11:31,085
now, uh, any situation

1180
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:35,356
a professional writer would
call upon someone to, uh,

1181
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:39,594
hold meetings, negotiate
and things like that.

1182
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:43,164
And seeing as how you're
inexperienced in those…

1183
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:45,433
Those sorta things, um…

1184
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:47,902
I was just wondering if…

1185
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:49,905
Just wondering if…

1186
01:11:51,874 --> 01:11:53,074
You wanna be my agent?

1187
01:11:53,075 --> 01:11:54,409
Yes.

1188
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:55,778
Uh…

1189
01:11:56,912 --> 01:11:59,614
- If you'd have me…
- Please, please, yes.

1190
01:11:59,615 --> 01:12:02,016
- Of course.
- That's great.

1191
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:03,751
This is great.

1192
01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:06,287
Blowing my mind. I don't even
know what to say right now.

1193
01:12:06,288 --> 01:12:08,222
We'll meet with them
tomorrow at 1:00.

1194
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:11,060
1:00? What about class?

1195
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:14,596
Fuck it.

1196
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:18,133
Brett Newport.

1197
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:21,870
Newport.

1198
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,972
You posted bail.

1199
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:07,483
Mr. Hall?

1200
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:22,931
You bailed me out?

1201
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:29,605
Well, what do you want?

1202
01:13:31,807 --> 01:13:33,242
I'd like to

1203
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:36,011
ask you some questions

1204
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:39,548
Are you hungry?

1205
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:45,052
There's a diner
just down the road and if…

1206
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:47,321
If you're hungry,
I'd like to buy you a meal.

1207
01:13:47,322 --> 01:13:48,689
Look, man.

1208
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:52,960
You wanna take me
out on a date or something?

1209
01:13:52,961 --> 01:13:55,496
That's cool. I'm easy.

1210
01:13:55,497 --> 01:13:57,331
You're just gonna have to
get my dog out too,

1211
01:13:57,332 --> 01:13:59,634
otherwise I'm not
going anywhere.

1212
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:02,004
I've already taken care of that.

1213
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:09,945
Okay, let's eat.

1214
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:21,256
Hmm.

1215
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:24,559
Mr. Hall, I've been
searching for you

1216
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,628
for the better half of a year.

1217
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:29,564
I'm a big fan.

1218
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:31,966
I've studied
both of your novels.

1219
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:34,402
Suburban Tragedy
and Stay of Execution.

1220
01:14:34,403 --> 01:14:35,771
I…

1221
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:39,240
I find them to be

1222
01:14:39,241 --> 01:14:41,076
extraordinary forms of map work.

1223
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:43,879
Map work, huh?

1224
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:47,215
You're a psycho fan, aren't you?

1225
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:48,516
No. No.

1226
01:14:48,517 --> 01:14:50,651
Well, I mean, maybe a little.

1227
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:54,989
Life isn't very interesting if
we're not a bit psychotic.

1228
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,124
Look…

1229
01:14:57,125 --> 01:14:59,962
I'm, uh…
I'm not a writer anymore.

1230
01:15:00,863 --> 01:15:02,230
You understand what I'm saying?

1231
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:03,331
I don't have any money.

1232
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:04,899
I, uh… There's nothing
I can give you.

1233
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,968
That's not what interests me.

1234
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:09,604
I've come here
with the intention of

1235
01:15:09,605 --> 01:15:11,707
presenting you with a deal.

1236
01:15:12,774 --> 01:15:16,111
In return for me
posting your bail,

1237
01:15:17,045 --> 01:15:19,014
I would like to ask you a favor.

1238
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:23,017
However, I need you
to say yes to this favor

1239
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:26,654
before I actually tell you
exactly what it is.

1240
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:29,992
No. No way. You have to
tell me what it is first.

1241
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:36,364
You're not really in a
position to bargain, Mr. Hall.

1242
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:40,468
Your propensity for starting
fires in public places.

1243
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:42,803
Has you at a disadvantage.

1244
01:15:42,804 --> 01:15:45,306
But don't worry, what I ask you,

1245
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:46,874
it will not take long.

1246
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:49,377
Oh, great, now why'd
you have to go and say that…

1247
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:52,713
First it was a favor, and now
it's a time-consuming favor.

1248
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:53,915
Well, there's nothing
to be afraid of,

1249
01:15:53,916 --> 01:15:56,017
it may even be therapeutic.

1250
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:57,318
Therapeutic?

1251
01:15:57,319 --> 01:15:59,487
Do you have any idea
what kind of fucked up things

1252
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:00,588
I'm imagining right now?

1253
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:02,290
- Then I suggest you say yes.
- Yes!

1254
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:03,925
Sure! Jesus Christ,

1255
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:05,793
just tell me what it is before
I have a heart attack already.

1256
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:08,030
I want to write a book
about you.

1257
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:10,531
Say again?

1258
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:14,069
I want to write
your biography. Your life.

1259
01:16:16,805 --> 01:16:18,706
You want to write a book
about me?

1260
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:20,675
I would like to write a book
about you.

1261
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:22,410
Absolutely not.
No. No, no, no.

1262
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:23,678
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1263
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,246
Have you ever written
anything before?

1264
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:26,181
I know what you've written.

1265
01:16:26,182 --> 01:16:28,482
You're one of the best writers
of our time.

1266
01:16:28,483 --> 01:16:30,518
Don't get ahead of yourself,
I'm not…

1267
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:31,819
That would be Francis Bishop.

1268
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,487
Have you ever read
Francis Bishop?

1269
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:34,922
Won the Pulitzer
the year I was nominated.

1270
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:36,190
Maybe he didn't deserve it.

1271
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:39,160
No, he, uh,
he deserved it all right.

1272
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:41,963
His follow-up book was
proof enough of that.

1273
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:45,333
My follow-up was
self-indulgent and pretentious

1274
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:46,400
so if you want to write about

1275
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:47,602
the greatest writer of our time

1276
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:50,338
I suggest you write about

1277
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:52,039
Francis Bishop.

1278
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,674
No, I'm no good at
autobiographies…

1279
01:16:53,675 --> 01:16:56,178
Look, I don't know what
to tell you then.

1280
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:09,191
You're Francis Bishop?

1281
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:16,697
Nah. The badge you flashed me.

1282
01:17:16,698 --> 01:17:18,300
The badge.

1283
01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:21,569
To tell you the truth,
I got this at a dollar store

1284
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:22,870
and it must be
a very good replica

1285
01:17:22,871 --> 01:17:24,338
because I've never had
a single person

1286
01:17:24,339 --> 01:17:25,906
ask me a question about it.

1287
01:17:25,907 --> 01:17:28,342
A dollar store?
You mean like "Just-a-Buck"?

1288
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:29,444
"Just-a-Buck."

1289
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:33,481
Hold on… Do you mind
if I see this?

1290
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:34,883
No, please.

1291
01:17:35,951 --> 01:17:39,253
Oh, my God. This is not real.

1292
01:17:39,254 --> 01:17:42,423
This is fake. You're not
fucking lying.

1293
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:44,826
No.

1294
01:17:47,195 --> 01:17:49,163
How many people have
you shown that to?

1295
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:52,299
Just about everyone from here
to New York City.

1296
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:57,471
Wait. Wait, you impersonated
an officer of the law.

1297
01:17:57,472 --> 01:17:58,939
You know that's illegal, right?

1298
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:02,109
I showed that to real police,
they didn't even flinch.

1299
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:03,811
You're crazy, man.
I thought I was fuckin' nuts.

1300
01:18:03,812 --> 01:18:04,879
You're fuckin' crazy.

1301
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:05,847
You know, I always wanted to

1302
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:07,114
get into
investigative journalism,

1303
01:18:07,115 --> 01:18:09,450
I never really did,
but I went full out on this.

1304
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:12,620
And/or it could have something
to do with a mid-life crisis,

1305
01:18:12,621 --> 01:18:13,954
I'm not sure which. However,

1306
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:16,558
nonetheless, here I am.

1307
01:18:20,595 --> 01:18:22,164
Wow.

1308
01:18:27,402 --> 01:18:29,770
- You have a family?
- A son.

1309
01:18:29,771 --> 01:18:31,473
Very handsome son.

1310
01:18:59,101 --> 01:19:01,403
What are you doing here?

1311
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:04,873
Visiting my wife.

1312
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,909
Well, she's busy.

1313
01:19:13,215 --> 01:19:15,016
What is that?

1314
01:19:24,559 --> 01:19:26,128
You found it?

1315
01:19:26,828 --> 01:19:28,997
I bought it.

1316
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:31,900
For you.

1317
01:19:33,401 --> 01:19:36,036
And we can go there
whenever you want.

1318
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:38,140
We can go there right now.

1319
01:19:39,908 --> 01:19:41,643
It's yours.

1320
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:46,781
You wanna go there right now?

1321
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:49,217
- I can't do that.
- Why?

1322
01:19:50,051 --> 01:19:52,653
Because we're not kids
anymore, Sidney.

1323
01:19:52,654 --> 01:19:53,854
What about…

1324
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:56,090
I can't just get in a car
and go off forever.

1325
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:58,259
What about being
spontaneous. Going west?

1326
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:00,728
Remember we used to
talk about that?

1327
01:20:00,729 --> 01:20:02,329
New beginnings.

1328
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:08,235
You're a photographer.
You can shoot from anywhere.

1329
01:20:08,236 --> 01:20:10,671
- I can write from anywhere.
- Sidney…

1330
01:20:10,672 --> 01:20:12,039
Don't do that, please,

1331
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,107
just if you don't want to
go west,

1332
01:20:13,108 --> 01:20:14,308
we don't need to go west,

1333
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:16,477
we can go north, south, east,
Europe, Asia.

1334
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,479
Wherever you want.
I just want to be with you.

1335
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,348
I'm pregnant.

1336
01:20:26,354 --> 01:20:28,423
It's yours.

1337
01:20:32,127 --> 01:20:34,563
So no.

1338
01:20:34,796 --> 01:20:36,665
I can't just go west.

1339
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:40,936
I don't get to be
spontaneous anymore.

1340
01:20:42,637 --> 01:20:44,004
Do you even care?

1341
01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:49,443
Of course I care. Don't…
Don't do that. Please. Please.

1342
01:20:49,444 --> 01:20:51,545
Because if you care,
things need to change.

1343
01:20:51,546 --> 01:20:56,417
I will change everything.
I'll change anything you want.

1344
01:20:56,418 --> 01:20:59,420
Are you cheating on me?

1345
01:20:59,421 --> 01:21:00,288
No.

1346
01:21:00,289 --> 01:21:04,191
- This is your only chance…
- I'm not cheating on you.

1347
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:05,659
This is the only
time to tell me.

1348
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:08,028
I get it,
we haven't been together.

1349
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:09,196
I'm not…

1350
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:10,331
This is your one
get-out-of-jail-free card.

1351
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:12,900
I'm not… Listen, I'm done.

1352
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:15,069
I'm done with that. I promise.

1353
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:18,372
You're my best friend.
I miss you so much.

1354
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:21,542
Please. Just give us a chance.

1355
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:24,379
I want to bring up this child
with you.

1356
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:28,950
Oh.

1357
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:37,258
If we want this to work,

1358
01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:39,728
we need to get back
to this moment.

1359
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:48,569
The rest of our lives have to
be as true as this moment was.

1360
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,372
Here.

1361
01:22:19,734 --> 01:22:23,404
Look, Francis, you know,
I'm a fan of yours.

1362
01:22:23,405 --> 01:22:24,805
I like your writing.
I really do.

1363
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:29,143
But I'm not exactly the kind
of guy that opens up.

1364
01:22:29,144 --> 01:22:30,210
You realize that

1365
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:31,245
both your books are still on

1366
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:32,680
The New York Times
bestseller list.

1367
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:35,282
I had no involvement in the
release of that second novel.

1368
01:22:35,283 --> 01:22:37,151
I know it was a success.

1369
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:38,552
I know that they hailed it

1370
01:22:38,553 --> 01:22:41,889
some sort of
stream-of-conscious bible.

1371
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:45,225
But it's just a bunch
of unfinished sentences.

1372
01:22:45,226 --> 01:22:48,228
- Unfinished sentences.
- Unfinished sentences.

1373
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:50,531
Probably some of
the most honest writing

1374
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:52,700
that you have ever done.

1375
01:22:52,701 --> 01:22:54,969
That's why it's even
bigger than the first book.

1376
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,171
I wrote a story,
people bought it.

1377
01:22:57,172 --> 01:23:00,207
Mr. Hall. You have
become the story.

1378
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:04,178
- You are the story now.
- Bullshit.

1379
01:23:04,179 --> 01:23:06,180
You know what
I think bullshit is?

1380
01:23:06,181 --> 01:23:08,116
I think bullshit is…

1381
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:11,085
It's people
who wander around the country

1382
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:13,620
pretending to be other people.

1383
01:23:13,621 --> 01:23:15,622
You wake up in the morning,
you look in the mirror.

1384
01:23:15,623 --> 01:23:17,257
I don't care
what you tell yourself,

1385
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:18,592
you're going to be
Sidney Hall period.

1386
01:23:18,593 --> 01:23:21,261
I mean, some writers they
don't even find their voice

1387
01:23:21,262 --> 01:23:22,863
until they're
I don't know what…

1388
01:23:22,864 --> 01:23:25,399
And here you are,
you're out wasting your time,

1389
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:28,369
what are you, age 30?

1390
01:23:30,605 --> 01:23:33,975
But what do I know?
What do I know…

1391
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:39,748
You don't know anything
about me.

1392
01:23:41,116 --> 01:23:43,752
I'd really like to.

1393
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:19,087
Mr. Hall.

1394
01:24:20,989 --> 01:24:24,291
I understand your reservations
about the biography.

1395
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:26,628
I respect your decision.

1396
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:31,565
I do suspect, however,

1397
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:34,702
that once I leave here, you're
not going to be contacting me.

1398
01:24:36,838 --> 01:24:40,874
So before I leave, there's
something I want you to know.

1399
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:45,145
This has been a very
personal journey for me.

1400
01:24:45,146 --> 01:24:46,448
I want you to know that

1401
01:24:47,382 --> 01:24:50,652
my son probably wouldn't alive
today if…

1402
01:24:51,786 --> 01:24:53,654
If he hadn't randomly
picked up a book

1403
01:24:53,655 --> 01:24:56,791
called Suburban Tragedy
out of my study.

1404
01:24:59,627 --> 01:25:05,165
His mother passed away
recently and he…

1405
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:09,002
He didn't really speak to anyone

1406
01:25:09,003 --> 01:25:11,638
until he read your book.

1407
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:16,210
So I guess you could say that
you brought my son back to me.

1408
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:18,913
And he is everything to me.

1409
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:22,050
He's all I've got.

1410
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:25,787
If our paths never cross again,

1411
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:29,724
it's been an honor meeting you.

1412
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:33,595
Only for a brief moment.

1413
01:25:42,303 --> 01:25:43,605
Francis.

1414
01:25:47,909 --> 01:25:49,944
You deserved it.

1415
01:25:52,013 --> 01:25:53,447
The Pulitzer.

1416
01:25:53,448 --> 01:25:56,117
You really did,
it's a great book.

1417
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:40,587
You know you should
really call your Dad.

1418
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:42,623
Your mom walked out on him.

1419
01:27:42,624 --> 01:27:44,959
Just in case you wanted to know.

1420
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:48,796
Okay, I'll change the subject.

1421
01:27:50,164 --> 01:27:54,034
- So I was thinking of names.
- Names?

1422
01:27:54,035 --> 01:27:55,369
For our baby.

1423
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:56,770
- Baby names?
- Mmm-hmm.

1424
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:58,505
- The little nugget.
- Mmm-hmm.

1425
01:27:58,506 --> 01:28:01,742
If it's a girl… Helen.

1426
01:28:01,743 --> 01:28:06,680
Which is really pretty.
And then if it's a boy, Homer.

1427
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:09,950
- Homer. Homer. No…
- You don't like it?

1428
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:11,952
Homer, no. He's going to get
his ass kicked with that name.

1429
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:13,954
- You can't name a kid Homer…
- Why? I like it.

1430
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:15,188
I don't know about that…

1431
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:16,757
Is it like Homer
in the Odyssey, Homer?

1432
01:28:16,758 --> 01:28:18,158
Or is it Homer
like Homer Simpson?

1433
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:20,327
No, it's neither…
It's our Homer.

1434
01:28:20,328 --> 01:28:22,562
- It's his own thing.
- Doh.

1435
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:27,402
Just think about it,
I think it's nice.

1436
01:28:34,108 --> 01:28:35,942
Do you recognize him?

1437
01:28:35,943 --> 01:28:40,081
Um, no. I thought it
was… Someone…

1438
01:28:41,416 --> 01:28:43,117
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1439
01:28:43,951 --> 01:28:45,386
Uh…

1440
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:49,890
- I saw a doctor few weeks ago.
- What for?

1441
01:28:49,891 --> 01:28:52,793
Nothing, it was just a checkup.

1442
01:28:52,794 --> 01:28:56,763
Uh, some, you know,
headaches I've been having.

1443
01:28:56,764 --> 01:28:58,999
Well, we know where
those come from.

1444
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,502
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

1445
01:29:02,503 --> 01:29:03,837
You're obviously not fine

1446
01:29:03,838 --> 01:29:05,639
if you had to go
see a doctor about it.

1447
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:07,308
I promise. It's nothing.

1448
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:10,877
All right. Well, I have to
go to the bathroom.

1449
01:29:10,878 --> 01:29:13,715
This conversation isn't over,
okay?

1450
01:29:14,882 --> 01:29:16,718
Okay.

1451
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:37,371
Sidney…
Sidney… Sidney…

1452
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:38,872
I'm still your friend, Sidney.

1453
01:29:38,873 --> 01:29:40,674
He writes about confrontation,

1454
01:29:40,675 --> 01:29:42,977
but in real life, he avoids it.

1455
01:29:44,746 --> 01:29:48,749
Sidney… You lost
the Pulitzer to Bishop.

1456
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:50,517
The core of our nation is etched

1457
01:29:50,518 --> 01:29:52,619
inside these plastic smiles.

1458
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:54,756
Endless rows of nowhere houses.

1459
01:29:55,723 --> 01:29:58,458
Are you fucking
my daughter, Sidney?

1460
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:03,897
Are you fucking my daughter?

1461
01:30:03,898 --> 01:30:05,665
You have to talk
to the press, Sidney.

1462
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:07,834
You can't avoid them forever.

1463
01:30:07,835 --> 01:30:09,870
You should be
ashamed of yourself…

1464
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:11,973
Are you fucking my daughter?

1465
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:16,778
Hi, Sidney.

1466
01:30:20,047 --> 01:30:22,015
Are you married, are you not
married? What's going on?

1467
01:30:22,016 --> 01:30:25,085
'Cause I'm getting a little
confused. Where is she?

1468
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:28,856
Hey, there was a long line.
Thanks for waiting.

1469
01:30:29,957 --> 01:30:31,958
Um, I think I've decided,

1470
01:30:31,959 --> 01:30:34,962
I'm just going to
have the risotto.

1471
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:40,300
She wants the risotto.

1472
01:30:40,301 --> 01:30:41,768
What's going on?

1473
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:43,403
She's a hallucination.

1474
01:30:43,404 --> 01:30:47,474
Yeah, I'm a fucking
hallucination, Sidney!

1475
01:30:47,475 --> 01:30:49,976
What's going on is I've been
fucking your husband.

1476
01:30:49,977 --> 01:30:51,878
In case you didn't
already realize that.

1477
01:30:51,879 --> 01:30:53,213
Or I don't know,
is he your husband?

1478
01:30:53,214 --> 01:30:55,115
Is he not your husband?
'Cause I can't really tell,

1479
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:57,417
sometimes when he's fucking me
so hard,

1480
01:30:57,418 --> 01:30:58,685
I assume he's not your husband.

1481
01:30:58,686 --> 01:31:01,988
Then here you guys are
having a great dinner.

1482
01:31:01,989 --> 01:31:03,657
Wow, you're so surprised

1483
01:31:03,658 --> 01:31:06,560
because
he's never done this before.

1484
01:31:06,561 --> 01:31:08,995
I fucked your husband
in case you didn't get that

1485
01:31:08,996 --> 01:31:11,399
across your little
princess brain, baby!

1486
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:14,235
Melody!

1487
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:35,156
What is this?
What are you doing?

1488
01:31:36,257 --> 01:31:37,624
I'm leaving.

1489
01:31:37,625 --> 01:31:38,825
What do you mean you're leaving?

1490
01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:40,627
I'm leaving,
that's what I'm doing.

1491
01:31:40,628 --> 01:31:43,263
I'm leaving tomorrow, for good.

1492
01:31:43,264 --> 01:31:45,232
You're not leaving,
the hell you are!

1493
01:31:45,233 --> 01:31:46,833
I'm getting the rest
of my things.

1494
01:31:46,834 --> 01:31:48,668
Stop it,
just let me explain myself!

1495
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:50,237
Just talk to me. Talk to me…

1496
01:31:50,238 --> 01:31:52,005
Explain what?

1497
01:31:52,006 --> 01:31:54,207
That you're a fucking liar
and a cheat?

1498
01:31:54,208 --> 01:31:57,577
With what money? You can't
even afford to get on a bus.

1499
01:31:57,578 --> 01:31:59,380
I sold a book.

1500
01:32:00,081 --> 01:32:01,781
What do you mean
you sold a book?

1501
01:32:01,782 --> 01:32:04,519
I got an advance on
a book I'm writing.

1502
01:32:05,953 --> 01:32:07,220
For how much?

1503
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:08,855
That's none of your
business, how much.

1504
01:32:08,856 --> 01:32:11,358
It is my business!

1505
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:13,627
How many were there?
How many were there!

1506
01:32:13,628 --> 01:32:16,196
- Please, don't do this.
- Two! Four! Ten! How many?

1507
01:32:16,197 --> 01:32:18,498
It didn't mean anything to me!

1508
01:32:18,499 --> 01:32:19,966
You're the only one
in my entire life

1509
01:32:19,967 --> 01:32:22,168
- that means anything to me.
- Don't give me that bullshit!

1510
01:32:22,169 --> 01:32:26,773
Everything is your business.
You go through my things.

1511
01:32:26,774 --> 01:32:28,708
You breathe down my neck!

1512
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:30,744
I can't… I can't breathe
when I'm around you!

1513
01:32:30,745 --> 01:32:32,946
I've put every dime
I've ever earned,

1514
01:32:32,947 --> 01:32:34,247
I have put towards you!

1515
01:32:34,248 --> 01:32:36,182
That's Dad's money.
It's called disability.

1516
01:32:36,183 --> 01:32:38,118
It's not bullshit!

1517
01:32:38,119 --> 01:32:40,821
- Get the fuck away from me.
- All right.

1518
01:32:45,059 --> 01:32:47,093
You got to be fucking
kidding me.

1519
01:32:47,094 --> 01:32:49,095
This can't be fucking happening.

1520
01:32:49,096 --> 01:32:51,431
You wanna hit me?
You wanna slap your son?

1521
01:32:51,432 --> 01:32:54,367
- Come on, do it again.
- Don't you disrespect me!

1522
01:32:54,368 --> 01:32:55,503
Oh!

1523
01:32:57,071 --> 01:32:59,472
Maybe this is a blessing
in disguise.

1524
01:32:59,473 --> 01:33:01,608
We can finally talk about

1525
01:33:01,609 --> 01:33:04,444
the things we never
get to talk about.

1526
01:33:04,445 --> 01:33:06,147
I'm feeling claustrophobic.

1527
01:33:11,519 --> 01:33:14,220
You don't get to
choose when you leave me!

1528
01:33:14,221 --> 01:33:15,156
You don't get to choose.

1529
01:33:15,157 --> 01:33:16,990
When I had you,
I didn't have a choice!

1530
01:33:16,991 --> 01:33:18,992
I didn't get a choice
when I had you!

1531
01:33:18,993 --> 01:33:21,094
- You don't have a choice!
- Stop.

1532
01:33:21,095 --> 01:33:24,698
Let go of me!
Why are you defending him?

1533
01:33:27,668 --> 01:33:29,370
He's leaving me!

1534
01:33:30,838 --> 01:33:34,308
He can't… I won't…

1535
01:33:36,177 --> 01:33:37,812
Velouria…

1536
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:41,816
Velouria…

1537
01:33:43,317 --> 01:33:45,453
- Let him go.
- No…

1538
01:33:47,154 --> 01:33:49,389
Lights won't come on…

1539
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:57,064
Hello!

1540
01:33:58,633 --> 01:34:00,401
Can anyone hear me?

1541
01:34:18,452 --> 01:34:20,955
Is it because of the journals?

1542
01:34:22,423 --> 01:34:25,192
It's not just one thing, Mom.

1543
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:28,828
It's not just one thing.

1544
01:34:28,829 --> 01:34:34,501
Hello! Hello!
Can anybody hear me?

1545
01:34:36,137 --> 01:34:37,338
Mel?

1546
01:34:38,606 --> 01:34:42,043
Mel, honey?
Where's your inhaler?

1547
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:44,412
Where's your inhaler?

1548
01:34:53,988 --> 01:34:57,157
It's not in here.
It's not in your purse.

1549
01:34:57,158 --> 01:35:00,394
All right. Did you leave
it at the restaurant.

1550
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:03,263
All right, just listen.
Breathe.

1551
01:35:03,264 --> 01:35:05,198
Uh, we're going to be out
of here real soon, all right?

1552
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:08,903
You'll be out of here
real soon. Just relax.

1553
01:35:21,048 --> 01:35:23,817
- Can anybody hear me?
- Yeah, you're down there?

1554
01:35:23,818 --> 01:35:25,151
Yeah. Hello! Hello!

1555
01:35:25,152 --> 01:35:27,821
My wife and I have been
trapped in the elevator

1556
01:35:27,822 --> 01:35:30,223
for quite some time now.
She has asthma.

1557
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:33,960
She can't breathe very well.
We don't have her medication.

1558
01:35:33,961 --> 01:35:36,863
I'll call 911,
but it might take a few, okay?

1559
01:35:36,864 --> 01:35:39,467
Just hurry. Please.

1560
01:35:43,804 --> 01:35:45,039
Honey,

1561
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:48,174
just hang in there,
it'll be all right.

1562
01:35:48,175 --> 01:35:51,544
It'll be all right. Please.

1563
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:00,287
I'm sorry…

1564
01:36:01,722 --> 01:36:04,191
I'm so sorry.

1565
01:36:05,226 --> 01:36:06,727
Mel…

1566
01:36:08,829 --> 01:36:10,397
I failed…

1567
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:15,269
You deserve so much
better than this.

1568
01:36:16,804 --> 01:36:19,373
You deserve more than me.

1569
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:41,227
I'm right here. Can you hear
that? Can you hear that?

1570
01:36:41,228 --> 01:36:45,632
They're almost here,
just a few more minutes, okay?

1571
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:47,301
All right?

1572
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:52,639
I'm here. I'm right here
with you. Just calm down.

1573
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,174
Breathe…

1574
01:36:54,175 --> 01:36:58,011
The entire
Southwest on wildfire alert…

1575
01:36:58,012 --> 01:37:00,647
I'll be back, the day before.

1576
01:37:00,648 --> 01:37:01,915
We'll get some dinner,

1577
01:37:01,916 --> 01:37:03,651
I'll take you out
with all your buddies.

1578
01:37:04,919 --> 01:37:06,653
I look forward to meeting her.

1579
01:37:06,654 --> 01:37:09,022
Sidney Hall was
recently declared deceased…

1580
01:37:09,023 --> 01:37:10,423
All right, I love you too…

1581
01:37:10,424 --> 01:37:12,158
…has reemerged
an hour ago.

1582
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:13,426
All right, goodbye.

1583
01:37:13,427 --> 01:37:14,828
Renowned author was admitted

1584
01:37:14,829 --> 01:37:17,030
to Taos General Hospital,
in Taos, New Mexico.

1585
01:37:17,031 --> 01:37:18,498
This is the first time that

1586
01:37:18,499 --> 01:37:21,501
the notoriously reclusive
Mr. Hall has been heard from

1587
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:23,369
or seen in public
in over seven years.

1588
01:37:23,370 --> 01:37:26,774
Those at the hospital
say his condition is critical.

1589
01:37:30,311 --> 01:37:31,078
Hello?

1590
01:37:36,917 --> 01:37:38,117
When he gained consciousness,

1591
01:37:38,118 --> 01:37:40,220
we asked him
who he wanted us to call.

1592
01:37:40,221 --> 01:37:41,621
You were the only one
he mentioned.

1593
01:37:41,622 --> 01:37:43,489
You're the only person
he wants in the room.

1594
01:37:43,490 --> 01:37:45,325
What happened to him?

1595
01:37:45,326 --> 01:37:47,227
There are indications
of scarring

1596
01:37:47,228 --> 01:37:48,728
on the right side of his brain.

1597
01:37:48,729 --> 01:37:50,597
His liver is barely functioning.

1598
01:37:50,598 --> 01:37:53,666
And he has a history of
seizures. Simply put…

1599
01:37:53,667 --> 01:37:58,771
He's been going for years with
no medication or treatment.

1600
01:37:58,772 --> 01:38:00,773
Is he going to be all right?

1601
01:38:00,774 --> 01:38:03,276
His body is failing
him, Mr. Bishop.

1602
01:38:03,277 --> 01:38:05,578
But his mind still seems sharp.

1603
01:38:05,579 --> 01:38:08,649
He claims it's the comfiest
bed he's slept in, in years.

1604
01:38:16,223 --> 01:38:19,426
Well, I guess I'll go in then.

1605
01:38:53,661 --> 01:38:57,464
This is the home we've
been waiting for, all right?

1606
01:38:58,832 --> 01:39:02,236
I haven't seen her in
a long time.

1607
01:39:04,905 --> 01:39:06,774
Almost forgot.

1608
01:39:07,841 --> 01:39:10,244
I swore I'd never forget this.

1609
01:39:29,363 --> 01:39:30,964
Mr. Hall.

1610
01:39:30,965 --> 01:39:35,202
Call me Sidney, for fuck's sake.

1611
01:39:37,338 --> 01:39:38,572
Okay.

1612
01:39:39,106 --> 01:39:41,674
Where's Homer?

1613
01:39:41,675 --> 01:39:43,210
He's at the house.

1614
01:39:44,545 --> 01:39:47,213
I promise you
I'll take care of him

1615
01:39:47,214 --> 01:39:48,748
until you get out of here.

1616
01:39:48,749 --> 01:39:51,285
You see that, right there?

1617
01:39:51,986 --> 01:39:54,588
There's a package…

1618
01:40:01,228 --> 01:40:05,331
It's just a portion of
my writings.

1619
01:40:05,332 --> 01:40:10,903
And scribblings. Just stuff
from over the years.

1620
01:40:10,904 --> 01:40:14,140
It's yours if you want it.

1621
01:40:14,141 --> 01:40:15,876
Use it.

1622
01:40:16,944 --> 01:40:19,780
Do what you want with it.

1623
01:40:32,693 --> 01:40:36,296
There are three reasons why
I called you here today.

1624
01:40:38,298 --> 01:40:40,066
One is that…

1625
01:40:40,067 --> 01:40:42,736
I want you to write
this little book of yours.

1626
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:45,939
Two.

1627
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:49,742
…is that there's something
I never documented

1628
01:40:49,743 --> 01:40:52,279
that I need to get off my chest.

1629
01:40:53,747 --> 01:40:56,283
And the third is…

1630
01:40:57,651 --> 01:41:00,721
You're the only person I know.

1631
01:41:01,755 --> 01:41:03,857
Where do you want to start?

1632
01:41:04,958 --> 01:41:06,426
We'll start with the person

1633
01:41:06,427 --> 01:41:08,762
Suburban Tragedy is based on.

1634
01:41:10,798 --> 01:41:14,867
His name was Brett Newport.

1635
01:41:14,868 --> 01:41:17,938
And this is how I killed him.

1636
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:40,193
What's in it?

1637
01:41:40,194 --> 01:41:42,161
None of your business.

1638
01:41:42,162 --> 01:41:44,997
Here, hide this. Now! Go…

1639
01:41:44,998 --> 01:41:46,632
Get out of the car!

1640
01:41:46,633 --> 01:41:50,570
Remember, you hold the key.
All right… You hold the key!

1641
01:41:50,571 --> 01:41:53,739
He wasn't in school on Monday.

1642
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:55,842
He was probably grounded
and beaten,

1643
01:41:55,843 --> 01:41:58,978
which would have explained
the bruises I saw on his face

1644
01:41:58,979 --> 01:42:00,414
later that week.

1645
01:42:01,782 --> 01:42:04,617
Hey, so, um,
you still have that thing?

1646
01:42:04,618 --> 01:42:08,054
Yeah. Yeah.
I can bring it

1647
01:42:08,055 --> 01:42:10,324
to the finals on
Monday if you want.

1648
01:42:13,093 --> 01:42:16,929
I stared at that lunch box
for over half an hour.

1649
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:19,999
What was the best way
to go about this?

1650
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,870
Melody was still forefront
on my mind.

1651
01:42:23,871 --> 01:42:27,240
Somehow I felt obligated
to bring closure

1652
01:42:27,241 --> 01:42:29,109
to this current development.

1653
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:38,784
Even now, deep down I knew
that once I opened that box,

1654
01:42:38,785 --> 01:42:41,254
it would ultimately not be
the ending

1655
01:42:41,255 --> 01:42:44,690
or rather the beginning
of something very unfortunate.

1656
01:42:44,691 --> 01:42:46,093
Did you watch it?

1657
01:42:50,464 --> 01:42:52,866
Look man, it's, uh…

1658
01:42:54,134 --> 01:42:56,602
It's really none of my business.

1659
01:42:56,603 --> 01:42:58,705
Did you watch it?

1660
01:43:08,515 --> 01:43:11,817
There, documented on video

1661
01:43:11,818 --> 01:43:13,419
was Brett's Father,

1662
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:19,025
Judge George Newport, having
sex with an underage girl.

1663
01:43:20,894 --> 01:43:23,095
And when it was finally over,

1664
01:43:23,096 --> 01:43:27,733
he would arrange for a car
to take her back to school,

1665
01:43:27,734 --> 01:43:30,504
middle-school by
the looks of it.

1666
01:43:32,973 --> 01:43:36,309
And then just minutes
after the Judge left,

1667
01:43:36,310 --> 01:43:38,378
it all came together.

1668
01:43:52,993 --> 01:43:54,061
Smart kid.

1669
01:43:54,828 --> 01:43:55,928
Who would have known

1670
01:43:55,929 --> 01:43:57,496
underneath that football helmet

1671
01:43:57,497 --> 01:43:59,165
was such a damaged soul.

1672
01:43:59,166 --> 01:44:03,069
A soul that may well have been
on its way to greatness

1673
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:06,072
had it not been stilted
by an upbringing

1674
01:44:06,073 --> 01:44:09,875
I couldn't even begin
to imagine.

1675
01:44:09,876 --> 01:44:11,477
I'm gonna kill him,
I swear to God,

1676
01:44:11,478 --> 01:44:12,912
next time he tries to touch me,

1677
01:44:12,913 --> 01:44:14,714
I'm gonna take a knife

1678
01:44:14,715 --> 01:44:16,616
and I'm gonna stab him
in his fucking neck.

1679
01:44:16,617 --> 01:44:18,151
Okay, look, man,

1680
01:44:19,086 --> 01:44:21,220
if you turn the tape
in to the authorities,

1681
01:44:21,221 --> 01:44:24,958
he won't be around anymore.
You know?

1682
01:44:26,693 --> 01:44:28,928
He rapes Darcy…

1683
01:44:28,929 --> 01:44:30,062
Okay. You're going to have to

1684
01:44:30,063 --> 01:44:31,597
turn in the tape
as soon as possible.

1685
01:44:31,598 --> 01:44:33,032
She doesn't say anything,
but I know he does it, man.

1686
01:44:33,033 --> 01:44:36,102
Because I can hear her cry,
some nights, through the wall.

1687
01:44:36,103 --> 01:44:39,071
Listen.
Listen, this has to end.

1688
01:44:39,072 --> 01:44:40,840
All right. This has to end

1689
01:44:40,841 --> 01:44:44,278
and that's why
we dug it up. Right?

1690
01:44:45,746 --> 01:44:47,947
That's why we dug it up.
So this can end.

1691
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:49,715
I'm gonna stab
the fucking bastard.

1692
01:44:49,716 --> 01:44:52,118
Listen to me, man,
don't do anything stupid.

1693
01:44:52,119 --> 01:44:55,454
Alright? Just wait until
Monday, we'll turn it in.

1694
01:44:55,455 --> 01:44:56,890
I'll go in with you.

1695
01:44:57,457 --> 01:44:59,293
Okay? I'll go with you.

1696
01:45:01,662 --> 01:45:04,297
I should have turned
that tape in.

1697
01:45:04,298 --> 01:45:06,098
I should have listened
to his words

1698
01:45:06,099 --> 01:45:09,168
and taken them more seriously.

1699
01:45:09,169 --> 01:45:10,303
But I didn't.

1700
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:12,873
- This is Melody.
- Hi.

1701
01:45:16,476 --> 01:45:18,544
Are those my notebooks?

1702
01:45:18,545 --> 01:45:20,280
What's going on?

1703
01:45:24,985 --> 01:45:26,586
I found this in your VCR.

1704
01:45:27,521 --> 01:45:29,722
No… No,
it's not what you think.

1705
01:45:29,723 --> 01:45:31,091
I don't know what to think.

1706
01:45:31,992 --> 01:45:33,259
I mean,
I don't know if it's porn

1707
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:35,394
or some black market S'n'M shit

1708
01:45:35,395 --> 01:45:38,931
but it is much sicker than
I imagined you to have.

1709
01:45:38,932 --> 01:45:40,866
You know.
And after watching this,

1710
01:45:40,867 --> 01:45:42,501
I thought I better
read your journals,

1711
01:45:42,502 --> 01:45:45,771
because I better get
some insight into my son.

1712
01:45:45,772 --> 01:45:49,208
And all I read about
was drugs and masturbation

1713
01:45:49,209 --> 01:45:51,210
and black high school teachers,

1714
01:45:51,211 --> 01:45:54,447
and let's not forget about
the beautiful passages

1715
01:45:54,448 --> 01:45:55,815
about your mother, the whore!

1716
01:45:55,816 --> 01:45:56,982
The high school cheerleader

1717
01:45:56,983 --> 01:45:58,784
that got knocked up
by the tight end.

1718
01:45:58,785 --> 01:46:00,052
You don't understand, all right?

1719
01:46:00,053 --> 01:46:01,921
- Just give me…
- Don't understand?

1720
01:46:01,922 --> 01:46:03,389
- Stop it.
- Fuck you!

1721
01:46:03,390 --> 01:46:04,623
No! No! No!

1722
01:46:04,624 --> 01:46:06,192
You will learn about respect

1723
01:46:06,193 --> 01:46:08,861
when you write
about your mother!

1724
01:46:08,862 --> 01:46:11,964
Maybe next time
you'll think twice!

1725
01:46:11,965 --> 01:46:16,370
- No! No! Stop it! Stop it!
- Oh, fucking…

1726
01:46:35,322 --> 01:46:37,691
No. No.

1727
01:46:47,734 --> 01:46:51,137
Brett called me to
ask when we should meet up.

1728
01:46:51,138 --> 01:46:53,639
And I had to tell him
the tape was gone.

1729
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:55,108
And he hung up on me.

1730
01:46:56,376 --> 01:46:59,912
He died on an unusually
cold Sunday.

1731
01:46:59,913 --> 01:47:03,015
Stabbed himself, in the stomach.

1732
01:47:04,351 --> 01:47:05,818
There were rumors

1733
01:47:05,819 --> 01:47:09,388
that he did it to
avoid military school.

1734
01:47:09,389 --> 01:47:10,856
But I knew the truth.

1735
01:47:12,726 --> 01:47:14,361
I killed him…

1736
01:47:20,734 --> 01:47:22,402
You can't blame
yourself for that.

1737
01:47:23,503 --> 01:47:26,673
I may not have been there
when the knife went in,

1738
01:47:28,608 --> 01:47:31,510
but I was there ever since.

1739
01:47:31,511 --> 01:47:34,514
He's been with me.

1740
01:47:36,616 --> 01:47:39,718
I know the entire
course of a person's life

1741
01:47:39,719 --> 01:47:43,523
can change, in a millisecond.

1742
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:48,027
Do something.

1743
01:47:48,028 --> 01:47:51,030
- Do something. Do something.
- I'm trying to.

1744
01:47:51,031 --> 01:47:53,232
I'm trying to,
let me do something.

1745
01:47:53,233 --> 01:47:54,867
Sing.

1746
01:47:54,868 --> 01:47:56,635
- Sing what?
- Sing…

1747
01:47:56,636 --> 01:47:58,671
- Sing?
- Sing.

1748
01:47:58,672 --> 01:48:00,739
What do you want me to sing?
What do you want me to sing?

1749
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:02,241
I'll sing anything you want.

1750
01:48:02,242 --> 01:48:05,678
All right… I'll sing.

1751
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:07,513
I will.

1752
01:48:07,514 --> 01:48:09,849
Yeah…

1753
01:48:09,850 --> 01:48:15,955
If today was not
a crooked highway

1754
01:48:17,324 --> 01:48:23,730
If tonight I could
finally stand up tall

1755
01:48:25,499 --> 01:48:31,971
If tomorrow wasn't
such a long time.

1756
01:48:31,972 --> 01:48:36,208
Then lonesome would
mean nothing to me at all

1757
01:48:36,209 --> 01:48:39,245
Stay with me…
Stay with me…

1758
01:48:39,246 --> 01:48:46,452
If only my love was
standing by me

1759
01:48:48,321 --> 01:48:53,126
If I could hear her
heart a-softly poundin'

1760
01:48:55,128 --> 01:49:01,000
If only she was lyin' by me

1761
01:49:01,001 --> 01:49:06,005
I'd lie in my bed

1762
01:49:06,006 --> 01:49:08,541
Once again

1763
01:49:08,542 --> 01:49:10,209
Stay with me.

1764
01:49:10,210 --> 01:49:12,011
I only know the first verse.

1765
01:49:12,012 --> 01:49:13,812
I don't know the second verse.

1766
01:49:13,813 --> 01:49:15,180
You want me to keep singing,

1767
01:49:15,181 --> 01:49:16,783
I'll keep singing for you.

1768
01:49:19,519 --> 01:49:26,625
If today was
like a crooked highway

1769
01:49:26,626 --> 01:49:34,199
If tonight I could
finally stand up tall

1770
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:39,839
If tomorrow wasn't
such a long time

1771
01:49:42,375 --> 01:49:47,280
Then lonesome would mean nothing

1772
01:49:48,782 --> 01:49:50,316
To me at all

1773
01:49:50,317 --> 01:49:55,988
Breathe. Honey? Honey?
Sweetheart…

1774
01:49:55,989 --> 01:50:02,596
Mel? Mel? Mel…
Wake up. Come on, breathe.

1775
01:50:04,764 --> 01:50:06,299
Oh, no.

1776
01:50:55,315 --> 01:50:57,817
Once Melody left me,

1777
01:50:59,219 --> 01:51:00,719
it dawned on me,

1778
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:04,890
looking out at all those
wonderful city lights,

1779
01:51:04,891 --> 01:51:09,928
that I was just one of those
millions of city lights,

1780
01:51:09,929 --> 01:51:12,232
a tiny little pixel,

1781
01:51:13,066 --> 01:51:16,735
buried within
the white noise of life,

1782
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:21,841
blinking on for just
a brief second in time.

1783
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:29,715
I didn't want to be a martyr.

1784
01:51:29,716 --> 01:51:31,551
I wanted to be nobody.

1785
01:51:35,355 --> 01:51:38,223
And I walked out
of that apartment

1786
01:51:38,224 --> 01:51:40,960
with only the clothes
on my back.

1787
01:51:42,562 --> 01:51:44,698
To become nobody.

1788
01:51:45,899 --> 01:51:47,867
I never returned again.

1789
01:52:26,239 --> 01:52:29,843
I just keep replaying
that scene.

1790
01:52:31,511 --> 01:52:36,850
Hoping against hope
that the ending would change.

1791
01:52:38,351 --> 01:52:44,456
That she would just wake up…

1792
01:52:44,457 --> 01:52:46,793
And say, "Sidney…

1793
01:52:53,867 --> 01:52:55,869
"I'm not leaving you just yet.

1794
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:02,075
"I'm still pregnant."

1795
01:53:13,787 --> 01:53:15,054
Sidney.
