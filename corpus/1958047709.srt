"Oh living flame of love,

00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:31,598
that tenderly wounds my
soul on its deepest center.

"tear through the veil of

My name is Don Alonso Alvarez de Toledo.

10
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,941
And I want to tell you the
story of the greatest poet

11
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,526
that Spain has ever known.

12
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:04,931
I met him in 1554 when he was only a boy

13
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:10,336
very, very poor but
nevertheless extraordinary.

14
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:13,006
I felt that even then.

15
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,143
What was so extraordinary about him?

16
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,914
Well, he didn't have an easy life.

17
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:23,249
He suffered greatly.

18
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:29,422
But inside, that's where the
real drama was, in his heart.

19
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:32,175
(longing music continues)

20
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,093
When a man is in love,

21
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:38,381
and John was in love with God,

22
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,183
he will never be satisfied

23
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,551
with anything less

24
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,870
than total union with his beloved.

25
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,657
So he sought a life of contemplation

26
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:50,026
and poverty and sacrifice

27
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,311
in the Carmelite Order.

28
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:53,947
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

29
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,734
Listen as I tell you the story

30
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,403
of John of the Cross.

31
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,123
(birds twitter)

32
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,527
(grass rustles)

33
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,215
- [Alonso] Her name was Catalina Alvarez.

34
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:22,819
And she was destitute and homeless.

35
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,621
Her husband had just died.

36
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,473
And bread was not to be had for any money.

37
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,827
It was a three-day
journey from her village

38
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,512
to the town of Torrijos.

39
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,265
Yet she had to make the trip.

40
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,318
For in Torrijos lived the
brother of her dead husband.

41
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,171
This brother was wealthy,

42
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,474
and perhaps he would
help her small son, John.

43
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,125
It was her only hope.

44
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,963
- My brother was dead
to me long ago, Señora.

45
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:54,667
When he married you, he
disgraced the de Yepes' family name.

46
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,954
There is nothing I can do for you.

47
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:58,896
- But this is your nephew,

48
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:01,024
your own flesh and blood, Señor.

49
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,492
Look at him, look.

50
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,360
Do not leave him in this misery.

51
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,663
For God's mercy, Señor, have pity.

52
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,731
- This child is nothing to me.

53
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,834
Please, Señora, you really must leave.

54
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,036
(dejected music)

55
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,387
Go away now.

56
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,950
- Catalina had nowhere to go.

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,451
She continued on her journey,

58
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,520
begging for food along the way

59
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,390
until she finally settled
here in Medina del Campo,

60
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,109
where she found work as a weaver.

61
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,828
Nine years passed

62
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:39,862
during which John grew

63
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,415
into an exceptionally bright young boy.

64
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,535
But he was isolated
from the other children

65
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,053
by his quiet nature.

66
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,123
His mother loved him very much

67
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,042
and taught him to love God.

68
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:56,996
(affectionate music continues)

69
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:01,384
- My son, we are poor. It's true.

70
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,853
But you must always remember to have hope,

71
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,689
because we have Our
Lord and the Blessed Virgin

72
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,207
to watch over us.

73
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,567
- [Alonso] Catalina was determined

74
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,969
to get him an education.

75
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,472
So she came to me one day

76
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,775
and asked me to take
John under my patronage

77
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:29,212
so that he could attend
the Jesuit college.

78
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:33,216
I was the Administrator of the
plague hospital here in town,

79
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,350
and I had a place

80
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,620
for a quick-witted eager and zealous boy

81
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,490
who could assist me
in caring for the sick.

82
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,842
So I decided to help him.

83
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,670
- [Adult John] "Where
have you hidden, Beloved",

84
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,821
and left me moaning.

85
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:59,158
You fled like the stag after wounding me.

86
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,128
I went out calling you.

87
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,330
And you were gone.

88
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,457
"Seeking my love,

89
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,944
I will head for the
mountains and for watersides.

90
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:23,216
I will not gather flowers
nor fear wild beasts.

91
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,856
"I will go beyond strong
men and frontiers."

92
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,283
- More years passed.

93
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,503
And John grew into a remarkable young man.

94
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,757
He had a special gift
for caring for the sick.

95
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,076
He was kind and very devout.

96
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,830
He spent many hours in prayer.

97
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,133
But the other students
didn't understand that.

98
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,985
They thought him a bit aloof.

99
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,054
But I knew him better.

100
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,608
He was a brilliant student.

101
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,059
And I was so proud of him.

102
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,963
However, I was concerned about his future.

103
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,884
He had become like a son to me.

104
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,869
And I didn't want to lose him.

105
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,023
- John, close that book for a minute.

106
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,692
I need to talk to you.

107
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,227
- Yes, Don Alonso.

108
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,763
- You've been so preoccupied
these last few weeks.

109
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,598
You seem so far away.

110
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:29,849
- I'm sorry, Don Alonso.

111
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,802
(John sighs)

112
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,404
Don Alonso, you've been so kind to me.

113
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:37,774
I feel I could never repay you.

114
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:38,991
- What nonsense.

115
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:43,413
Do you know what a
consolation you have been to me?

116
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,848
I never had a son of my own, John.

117
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,484
And you have become
like my own flesh and blood.

118
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,620
Don't worry your head about repaying me.

119
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,388
I'm more than glad to have you here.

120
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,707
- Don Alonso, listen to me.

121
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:59,145
I need to tell you something
even if it makes you angry.

122
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,699
My final examinations are next month.

123
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:04,984
And, after that, I,

124
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,954
Don Alonso,

125
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,240
I want to be a priest.

126
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,043
- Wonderful, wonderful, my boy. (chuckles)

127
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,978
Why ever did you hesitate to tell me?

128
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:18,648
This is exactly what I had
in mind for you all a long.

129
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,751
Ha ha, then after you are ordained,

130
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,620
I have a prestigious opportunity for you.

131
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,323
I will appoint you the
Chaplain of the plague hospital.

132
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:30,827
Now, what will your mother
say to that do you think?

133
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,795
- You don't understand.

134
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,031
I can't stay.

135
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,349
I have to...

136
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,303
(affectionate music)

137
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,538
Did you ever love someone so much

138
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,215
that you were willing
to give up everything

139
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,942
for that person?

140
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,010
Well, that is how I feel.

141
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,048
I want to spend myself totally for my God.

142
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,851
Only in total sacrifice of my will

143
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,854
will I have any hope
for peace on this earth.

144
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,063
I believe I have found a place

145
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,390
where such a life is possible.

146
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,412
Don Alonso, God is calling
me to enter the Carmelites.

147
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:10,933
- The Carmelites? John,
you can't be serious.

148
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,169
Do you have any idea what a Carmelite is?

149
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,704
Why, all they do is pray.

150
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,806
And you, with all your education,

151
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,708
think of the good you could do here.

152
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,543
How can you think of wasting your life,

153
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,278
your mind, your talents?

154
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,579
No, no, no, no,

155
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:26,983
I'm sure God wants you
here in the hospital with me.

156
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,150
- But, Don Alonso, I-

157
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,119
- All your life you've been poor.

158
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,688
All your life you've been an outcast.

159
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,224
Do you think it will be any
different with the Carmelites?

160
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,660
It will be the same there.

161
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,929
Please be practical. (breathes)

162
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,865
With me you will have a comfortable life.

163
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,201
Think of your poor mother.

164
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,871
Under the circumstances,
I must forbid you to leave.

165
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:52,174
- Don Alonso, I will think
about what you have said,

166
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,010
(affectionate music)

167
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,495
but I won't disobey God's call.

168
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,751
- [John] "One dark night",

169
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,820
fired with love's urgent longings,

170
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,839
ah, the sheer grace!

171
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,508
I went out unseen,

172
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,511
"my house being now all stilled."

173
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,300
- [Alonso] When I
found out that he had left,

174
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,102
I was filled with sadness.

175
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,304
I suppose I felt

176
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,589
he had rejected and turned his back on me.

177
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,943
But I didn't realize then

178
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:30,129
how right the Carmelite
Order would be for John.

179
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,849
He had a passionate desire for prayer,

180
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,952
and in their contemplative life,

181
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,521
he could seek a union with God.

182
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,574
(adventurous music)

183
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:50,066
- [John] "Pouring out a thousand graces",

184
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,885
he passed these groves in haste.

185
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,905
And having looked at them,

186
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,674
with his image alone,

187
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,293
clothed them in beauty.

188
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:06,065
(triumphant organ music)

189
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:25,851
- [Alonso] So on the 24th
day of February, 1563,

190
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:29,438
he was clothed with the Carmelite habit

191
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:33,192
and took the name of
Brother John of St. Matthias.

192
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,166
(solemn music)

193
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,930
- [Friar] What do you seek?

194
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,866
- The mercy of God,

195
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,901
the poverty of the order,

196
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,619
and the society of the brothers.

197
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:05,708
- Do you intend to persevere in religion

198
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,827
till the end of your life?

199
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:09,945
- With the mercy of God

200
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,565
and the prayers of the brothers, I do.

poverty, and chastity to God

210

my brother, Juan
Baptista Rubio of Raveena,

212
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:17,229
Prior General of the order
of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.

213
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,684
I thank Our Lord for the
grace that He has granted me

214
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,152
in allowing me to be admitted

215
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:27,540

(bell tolls)

225
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,443
- John wanted to live the Carmelite life

226
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:22,945
in all its fullness,

227
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,080
according to the primitive rule.

228
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,916
However, not all the friars

229
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,084
felt the way he did. (troubled music)

230
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,120
The monastery in which he lived

231
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,423
had moved away from
the original aim of order,

232
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,926
which was detachment from the world.

233
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,061
Just as I predicted,

234
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:42,364
John gradually began to meet
with opposition and jealousy.

235
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,233
(Maldonado laughs) (woman laughs)

236
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,418
- You asked to see me, Father Maldonado?

237
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,510
- Yes, Fray John of St. Matthias.

238
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,894
Please, please, sit.

239
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,948
Take some wine.

240
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,082
(cork pops) (wine splashes)

241
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,417
It's an excellent vintage.

242
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,601
- No thank you, Father.

243
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,754
(bottle clunks)

244
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:09,508
- Fray John, I concerned about something.

245
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,978
Your name has come up a number of times.

246
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,198
It seems that some of the brothers feel

247
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,167
that you're not really participating

248
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,119
in the life of the community,

249
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,072
that you hold yourself apart.

250
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,206
- Father Maldonado,

251
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,542
if I've offended anyone in the community

252
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,826
I am truly sorry.

253
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,746
I've seen the way they look at me.

254
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,581
I'm not surprised.

255
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:35,017
I like to be by myself.

256
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,386
I came to Carmel to pray to God,

257
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,437
to love God,

258
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,724
but I have found all my desires frustrated

259
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,075
since I entered the order.

260
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:48,364
- I'm not going to say that
you are praying too much.

261
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,033
That would be ridiculous, of course.

262
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,985
But you're so intense.

263
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,188
The other brothers say that you

264
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,341
act as if you think

265
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:00,993
you are holier than they are.

266
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:04,530
Moderation, my dear Fray John.

267
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,751
You should learn to relax
and enjoy life a little more.

268
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,753
- But Father Maldonado,

269
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,822
don't you long for something
more, something deeper?

270
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:16,241
Isn't that why we both became Carmelites?

271
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,995
Sometimes my heart is so full

272
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:23,766
that I feel as if there is a
burning flame of love within me

273
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,536
so strong that it could
consume my whole being.

274
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:30,572
How can I contain these feelings of love?

275
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:34,326
How can I seek moderation
in my desire for God?

276
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,580
It seems our order has slid dangerously

277
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,250
down the slope of indulgence, Father.

278
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,319
(worrisome music continues)

279
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:46,088
Aren't we called to live in total poverty,

280
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,223
relying on the mercy of God?

281
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:51,894
All that I seek is to live in
detachment from my appetites,

282
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:54,163
so I can't understand what you want of me.

283
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:57,066
- You can't understand what I want.

284
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,867
Well, then let me make myself more clear.

285
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,336
(wrathful music continues)

286
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,254
You are a fanatic.

287
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,575
There is no place for your
extreme ideas in this order,

288
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,910
I can tell you that.

289
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,295
Fray John, let me warn you.

290
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:14,216
Unless you change your rebellious ways,

291
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,635
your days as a Carmelite will be over.

292
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,706
(contemplative music)

293
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,760
- [John] "Why, since
you wounded this heart",

294
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,011
don't you heal it?

295
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:30,332
And why, since you stole it from me,

296
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,468
do you leave it so

297
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:35,754
and fail to carry off
what you have stolen?

298
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,542
"Extinguish these miseries

299
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,362
since no one else can stamp them out

300
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,950
and may my eyes behold you

301
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,902
because you are their light.

302
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,672
"And I would open them to you alone."

303
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,943
(wind murmurs)

304
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,313
(bell peals)

305
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,702
(cheerful music)

306
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,970
(nuns speaking faintly)

307
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,240
- [Alonso] Her name was
Madre Teresa de Jesus,

308
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,808
Teresa of Avila.

309
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:16,845
And she was the most remarkable
woman then living in Spain.

310
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,882
For it was she who started
the great reform movement

311
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,717
within the Carmelite Order,

312
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,469
a return to the primitive rule.

313
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:27,356
Her followers were called
Discalced Carmelites,

314
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,691
because they wore no shoes on their feet.

315
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,268
- What kinds of changes
do you plan to make

316
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,961
within our monastery, mother?

317
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,430
- Simply to teach our sisters

318
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,965
about the incredible love of Jesus

319
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:40,035
as our founder originally intended.

320
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,953
Shall we go in now?

321
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:52,965
- Oh Lord, how is it that you
command the impossible?

322
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:57,069
I know what you're
calling me to do, but how?

323
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,490
How am I to lead the
reform not just of the nuns

324
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,226
but of the friars as well?

325
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,529
If only you would send me some sign,

326
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,915
some friar who would share my vision.

327
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,901
How long, oh Lord?

328
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:14,820
How long must I wait?

329
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,258
Dear Jesus, forgive me.

330
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:21,793
I'm too impatient.

331
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,930
But if you want me to do this,

332
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:27,499
send me a friar.

333
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:33,021
- God always listened to Madre Teresa.

334
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,674
It wasn't long before she found her friar.

335
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:41,463
In 1567, the year John
was ordained a priest,

336
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,931
these two mystics,

337
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:45,267
these two giants of the faith,

338
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,952
met for the first time.

339
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,422
What a moment that must have been.

340
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,703
(prayerful music)

341
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,844
- [John] "In darkness and secure",

342
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:16,899
by the secret ladder, disguised,

343
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,400
ah, the sheer grace!

344
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,670
In darkness and concealment,

345
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,506
"my house being now all stilled."

346
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,693
(curtain rod scrapes)

347
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:33,115
- Peace be with you,
Fray John of St. Matthias.

348
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,500
- And also with you,
Madre Teresa de Jesus.

349
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:40,556
- Fray John, I've heard some
disturbing things about you

350
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:41,757
that have made me suspect

351
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,860
that you might be just
the man I'm looking for.

352
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,095
- I know what you've heard.

353
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:48,263
I suppose they've told you

354
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,349
that I'm a failure as a Carmelite.

355
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,317
I guess it's true.

356
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,672
I just don't fit in with
the rest of the brothers.

357
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,808
I seem to be heading in
a very different direction.

358
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:04,012
- Yes, the question is in
what direction are you heading.

359
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,147
- Oh Madre Teresa,

360
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,115
(hopeful music continues)

361
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,801
I want to climb to the
summit the mountain,

362
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,905
I want to attain perfect union with God,

363
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,375
and I want to do it quickly

364
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:20,946
because my heart is overflowing with love.

365
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,166
- And your brothers do
not share your longing

366
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,551
or your impatience?

367
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,590
- When I speak of leaving
behind all earthly things

368
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:36,511
and of avoiding spiritual obstacles,

369
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:39,231
they accuse me of pride
and self-righteousness.

370
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,417
And I suppose this is always a danger.

371
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:46,138
- Yes, yes, they misunderstand you.

372
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:51,093
I know all about that danger

373
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,428
and about your longing too.

374
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,414
- I am traveling through a dark night

375
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:58,317
that is difficult to explain.

376
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:02,771
I've not found in the
order what I came to seek,

377
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,457
a life of contemplation of our Beloved.

378
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,411
I am taking steps to withdraw from Carmel

379
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,713
and to become a hermit.

380
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:14,216
I've asked the Carthusians to receive me.

381
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:17,686
- Patience, Fray John, patience.

382
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:20,122
How can you think of leaving the order

383
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,191
on the eve of its rebirth?

384
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:24,826
You've heard, I suppose, of the reforms

385
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:26,995
that I am instituting among the nuns?

386
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:29,698
- Yes, yes, it's wonderful
what you're doing, Mother.

387
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,733
- The prior general has granted permission

388
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:34,102
for the foundation of two houses

389
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,671
of contemplative Carmelites

390
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:39,024
not just for the nuns
but for the friars as well.

391
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,978
You, my young outcast,

392
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:46,682
are going to lead the
reform of the friars.

393
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:49,284
- Madre Teresa, how can you say that?

394
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:51,319
Ha, the friars won't listen to me.

395
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:52,921
- Ha ha, I don't care about that.

396
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,239
You're probably right.

397
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,676
I have just one question for you.

398
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:01,079
Are you ready for the cross?

399
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,866
- I long for suffering

400
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,935
and to be forgotten.

401
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:08,619
- Yes, Fray John.

402
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,423
God will grant the desires of your heart.

403
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:17,212
Join with me in renewing
the Carmelite family,

404
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:21,016
and you will climb that
mountain to your Beloved.

405
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,884
- I'm willing to join you

406
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,136
but under one condition.

407
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,105
Let there be no delay.

408
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:33,195
- Fray John, let your soul be at rest.

409
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,847
It shall be done by God.

410
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,137
(passionate music)

411
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,039
- [John] "Oh living flame of love"

412
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,708
that tenderly wounds my soul

413
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,727
in its deepest center,

414
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:53,899
since now you are not
oppressive, now consummate.

415
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,535
If it be your will,

416
00:23:57,702 --> 00:24:00,806
tear through the veil
of the sweet encounter.

417
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:05,310
(birds twitter)

418
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,932
"Oh lamps of fire

419
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,834
in whose splendors

420
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:15,370
the deep caverns of feeling,

421
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,640
once obscure and blind,

422
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:23,345
now give forth so rarely, so exquisitely,

423
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:26,298
both warmth and light to their beloved.

424
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:38,393
"How gently and lovingly
you wake in my heart

425
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,312
where in secret you dwell alone,

426
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:46,501
and by your sweet breathing
filled with good and glory,

427
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:49,905
"how tenderly you
swell my heart with love."

428
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:52,557
(ardent music)

429
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,631
- "Dear Madre Anna,

430
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,618
what an exciting time it is.

431
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,538
The reform is really
beginning to take hold.

432
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:12,611
Our faithful friar has a new
name, Fray John of the Cross,

433
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:16,248
and he is is fulfilling
all my expectations.

434
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,868
I feel I have finally found a partner

435
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,553
to share this work with me.

436
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:26,842
Fray John knows what the
true Carmelite spirit demands:

437
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,627
nothing less than perfection.

438
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:32,781
I recently invited him
to live in a stone hut

439
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:35,217
just outside the monastery walls,

440
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:38,220
and I think that he's happy here with us.

441
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,356
He has embraced an
austere life with a passion

442
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,575
and seems to thrive on suffering.

443
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:48,730
However, the other friars don't
appreciate his good example.

444
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,233
It pricks their consciences.

445
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,868
Many of them hate him.

446
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:56,972
Yet he is kindness itself
for the poor and the sick.

447
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,207
I have set him to work
as the spiritual advisor

448
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:00,609
of the sisters.

449
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,979
He can teach them
much about the interior life.

450
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:07,782
Indeed, I myself am learning from him.

451
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:11,853
He's such a wonderful confessor
and teacher, never rushing

452
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:15,657
while directing a person to a
deeper relationship with God.

453
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:20,562
However, our work here is
challenging, to say the least.

454
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:24,065
The sisters enjoy his
talks and spiritual direction,

455
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,735
but they have a long way to go.

456
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:31,306
This monastery is great
only in regards to its size.

457
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:33,141
The nuns in Avila

458
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:37,279
are notorious for their
worldliness and gossiping.

459
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,115
In fact, things are so bad

460
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:44,019
that the Convent of the
Incarnation has been called...

461
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,487
"Babylon."

462
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:48,123
(nuns giggle and chatter faintly)

463
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:51,509
(giddy music continues)

464
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:53,736
- [Nun] Don't you think

465
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,830
Father Ramirez is handsome?

466
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,640
- [Nun] I heard they were
caught kissing in the stables.

467
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,434
- Has anyone seen Señor Suarez?

468
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:00,835
- [Nun] Tell me, tell me.

469
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:03,939
(nuns chatter and laugh)

470
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,014
- [Nun] She's such a prig.

471
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,141
(nuns laugh)

472
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:07,976
- [Nun] And she knows,

473
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:10,628
but she always gives me the same penance.

474
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:14,516
- Gradually, over the
course of three years,

475
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:17,719
a transformation began
to take place at Avila.

476
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,188
In his simple persistent way,

477
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,290
Father John taught the sisters,

478
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,992
who so loved to talk,

479
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:25,694
to love to pray.

480
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:28,463
For prayer is, after
all, a talking to God.

481
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:30,465
(solemn music)

482
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:35,153
- In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.

483
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,790
Jesus be in your souls.

484
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:45,313
Dear sisters, you should
live in the monastery

485
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,298
as though no one else were in it,

486
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,053
never meddling in things
that happen in the community

487
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,371
nor with individuals.

488
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:57,993
Take no notice of their
good or bad qualities

489
00:27:58,043 --> 00:27:59,777
or their conduct.

490
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,247
You are like the stone

491
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,700
which must be chiseled and fashioned

492
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,552
before being used in the building.

493
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:11,306
Those who are in the monastery

494
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,876
are craftsmen placed there by God

495
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:16,611
to mortify you

496
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,296
by chiseling at you.

497
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:22,917
Some will you chisel with words,

498
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,136
telling you what you
would rather not hear,

499
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:27,922
others, by deed,

500
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:31,176
doing to you what you
would rather not endure,

501
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,062
others, by their temperament,

502
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:36,731
being in their person and in their actions

503
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:39,017
a bother and annoyance to you,

504
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:42,370
and others, by their thoughts,

505
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,356
neither esteeming
nor feeling love for you.

506
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:50,211
If this was not your reason
for entering the monastery,

507
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:51,730
you should not have done so

508
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:54,616
but should have remained in the world

509
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:59,204
to seek your comfort,
honor, reputation, and ease.

510
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:04,776
Strive to pray constantly in all you do.

511
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:10,632
Undertake all things,
agreeable or disagreeable,

512
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:13,868
for the sole purpose of pleasing God

513
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,488
by carrying Christ's Cross.

514
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:22,894
So sisters, do not engage
yourself in something less

515
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,280
nor pay heed to the crumbs

516
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,982
which fall from your Father's table.

517
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:31,219
Go forth and exult in your glory.

518
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,789
Hide yourself in it and rejoice,

519
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:39,144
and you will obtain the
desires of your heart.

520
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,085
(hopeful music)

521
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,773
- [John] "Following your footprints"

522
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:53,625
maidens run along the way.

523
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,411
The touch of a spark,

524
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,680
the spiced wine,

525
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,482
cause flowings in them

526
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,333
from the balsam of God.

527
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:06,688
"In the inner wine cellar,

528
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,990
I drank of my Beloved,

529
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,895
and, when I went abroad
through all this valley,

530
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:16,498
I no longer knew anything

531
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:19,217
"and lost the herd which I was following."

532
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:27,258
- The monastery changed from
a Babylon to a holy Jerusalem.

533
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,562
But persecution was beginning
to mount within the order.

534
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,616
- [Friar] Father Maldonado,
the sisters flock around him

535
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,084
as if he were a great saint.

536
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,460
- [Friar] We are losing all our influence.

537
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,686
And it's all because of him.

538
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:40,496
- [Maldonado] Who
does this man think he is?

539
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:42,431
- [Friar] He's all the
time alone with the nuns.

540
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:43,833
The whole thing seems suspicious to me.

541
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,301
- [Friar] I tell you, Father Maldonado,

542
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,095
this man is dangerous.

543
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:48,680
Something must be done!

544
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,154
- [Teresa] Fray John,
I need to speak to you.

545
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:58,690
- [John] Madre Teresa.

546
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:03,978
- [Teresa] Fray John, I am frightened.

547
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,014
- You, Mother? What could frighten you?

548
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:08,700
- (sighs) I'm not as brave as I look.

549
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,252
(Teresa sighs)

550
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:12,554
I've pulled you into this life,

551
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:15,323
and I feel responsible for your wellbeing.

552
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,907
- Yes, Mother.

553
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:19,594
- There are friars in
the order, Fray John,

554
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:22,931
who will stop at
nothing to kill the reform.

555
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,548
- Yes, I know.

556
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:28,703
God permits the devil
to blind and delude many.

557
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:31,089
- I fear for your very life, Fray John.

558
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,943
They see that other
friars are following you

559
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,978
into the reform movement.

560
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:40,114
I tell you, the war is on.

561
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:41,566
- Mother, listen to me.

562
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,135
We must try always to want

563
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,206
not the easiest but the most difficult.

564
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,294
Let us not choose a light burden.

565
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,013
For the heavier the burden is,

566
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,883
the lighter it becomes
when we carry it for Christ.

567
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:03,922
In silence and in hope
shall our strength be.

568
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,193
- So you embrace the cross,

569
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,313
whatever that might mean?

570
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:13,597
No regrets?

571
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:15,800
- No regrets, Mother,

572
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:19,771
only great joy and love.

573
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:25,710
(vindictive music)

574
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,553
- I have important news.

575
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:41,042
Father Tostado, the
visitor general of the order,

576
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:43,044
will arrive here tomorrow

577
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:46,097
to carry out the mandate
of the general chapter.

578
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:50,635
The reform will be suppressed.

579
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:56,124
For neither Madre Teresa
nor Father John of the Cross

580
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:59,344
have received any
authorization for what they do.

581
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:06,868
Madre Teresa will be
ordered to retire in one convent

582
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,086
and not stir.

583
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,222
She's a meddlesome and restless nun.

584
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:15,226
And we all know that she has a long arm.

585
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,697
But this Father John is different matter.

586
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:25,620
He refuses to renounce the reform.

587
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,705
Things have gotten out of control.

588
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,659
The visitor general has ordered

589
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,512
his immediate arrest and interrogation.

590
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,985
I authorize you to carry
out this injunction tonight.

591
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,990
Use force if necessary.

592
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,895
(troubled music)

593
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:55,049
- [John] "In darkness and concealment",

594
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:57,702
my house being now all stilled,

595
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:02,757
"on that glad night in secret,

596
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,425
for no one saw me,

597
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:06,661
nor did I look at anything

598
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,130
with no other light or guide

599
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,567
"than the one that burned in my heart."

600
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,953
(troubled music swells)

601
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,813
(hinge squeaks)

602
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:28,282
- [Soldier] Fray John of the
Cross, you are under arrest,

603
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:29,934
in the name of Father Maldonado.

604
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:34,772
- Yes, I was expecting this.

605
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:41,312
(footsteps clop)

606
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,602
- [Maldonado] Father Tostado, this man is

607
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:51,272
a disobedient, rebellious,
and contumacious member

608
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:52,723
of the Discalced Carmelites.

609
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:58,262
By his arrogant pride,
he censures his brothers.

610
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,516
And by his extreme actions,

611
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:04,619
he's instigating a
movement among the friars

612
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:07,572
that could destroy the
very life of our order.

613
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:13,077
(Tostado whispers)

614
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:19,434
Well, Father John of the Cross,

615
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:23,354
the visitor general is
prepared to show compassion.

616
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:28,059
After all, we are all brothers.

617
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,914
I appeal to your sense
of religious obedience.

618
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,283
- Father Maldonado, I am simply doing

619
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,218
what the Church and lawful authority

620
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,320
have commissioned me to do.

621
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,672
- What is the use of your resistance?

622
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:44,625
We will stop you one way or another.

623
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:46,010
You can be sure of that.

624
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,581
But, Father John,

625
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:54,018
we have been friends a long time.

626
00:35:57,188 --> 00:36:00,107
I have always admired your great mind.

627
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:01,476
You have great potential,

628
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:03,995
which you are wasting with Madre Teresa.

629
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,499
You should use your talent to
do good among your brothers.

630
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:14,872
If you renounce the reform here and now,

631
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:18,259
the visitor general is
prepared to offer you

632
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,877
the rank of prior.

633
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:25,233
You shall have comfortable
quarters and your own library.

634
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:26,767
How do you answer, Fray John?

635
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:28,536
(graceful music)

636
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:31,672
- He who seeks Christ,
stripped of all things,

637
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:34,442
has no need of gold or jewels or honors.

638
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:36,494
- Then you are confirmed in your error.

639
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:39,280
Father John of the Cross,

640
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,482
since you have refused due acceptance

641
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,384
of these orders and letters,

642
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:47,388
alleging in your excuse
lies and fabrications,

643
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:49,724
I declare you unworthy to hold office

644
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,142
in the Carmelite Order.

645
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,962
You will be held in solitary confinement

646
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:57,381
until you renounce this rebellion.

647
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:02,119
Strip him of his cowl and scapular.

648
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:05,522
Take him away.

649
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,876
- [Friar] Where shall we
put him, Father Maldonado?

650
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:10,478
- [Maldonado] I know the perfect place

651
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,979
that will break his will,

652
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:13,231
if nothing else can.

653
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:17,985
You know that little room that
adjoins the chamber upstairs?

654
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:20,354
- [Friar] You mean the storeroom, Father?

655
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,990
He'll go mad shut up in that airless tomb.

656
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,010
- [Maldonado] Yes indeed, indeed.

657
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:30,364
- [Guard] In here, priest.

658
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,408
- [Maldonado] This stubborn
brother will soon come

659
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,684
to his senses.

660
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:37,805
Bread and water only. (door creaks)

661
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:40,358
(lock clunks)

662
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:50,751
- [John] "This guided me more
surely than the light of noon

663
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:52,720
to where He waited for me,

664
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,056
Him I knew so well,

665
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,975
in a place where no one else appeared."

666
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:01,796
(crickets chirp)

667
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,097
- [Alonso] Eight months passed

668
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:06,100
in that dark and stifling cell.

669
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,386
But John never wavered.

670
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:16,010
- "What more do you want, O soul?

671
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,946
What else do you search for outside,

672
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,014
when within yourself

673
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,450
you possess your riches, delights,

674
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,669
satisfactions, fullness, and kingdom...

675
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,105
Your Beloved whom you desire and seek?

676
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:32,193
"The Kingdom of God is within you."

677
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:35,746
- Why do I bother with this pigheaded man?

678
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:38,666
If he were to disappear,

679
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,751
no one would ever know the difference.

680
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,373
Should he ever leave here at all,

681
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,942
it will only be for the cemetery.

682
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,410
- "Be joyful and gladdened

683
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,579
in your interior recollection with Him,

684
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:52,797
O precious soul.

685
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:55,566
For you have Him so close to you.

686
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:59,537
Desire Him there. Adore Him there.

687
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:03,257
Even though He does abide within you,

688
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:04,708
He is hidden.

689
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:07,161
Nevertheless, it is vital

690
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:09,997
for you to know the place of His hiding

691
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:14,535
"so that you may search for
Him there with assuredness."

692
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:16,487
- This man is a fool

693
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:19,206
indicted as a rebel,

694
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:21,192
not worthy of the name of Christian.

695
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:25,262
He is a hypocrite of the worst kind.

696
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:32,687
I know why he wishes
to go barefoot and clad

697
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:33,871
in a coarse habit...

698
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:38,025
So that he might be venerated as a saint.

699
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:41,095
- "Anyone who is to find a hidden treasure

700
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:44,865
must enter the hiding place secretly,

701
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:46,550
and once he has discovered it,

702
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:51,122
he shall also be hidden
just as the treasure is hidden.

703
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,725
"In order to find Him,

704
00:39:55,659 --> 00:40:00,114
you should forget all your
possessions and all creatures

705
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:05,169
"and hide within the interior
secret chamber of your spirit."

706
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,522
- Who has sown the
seeds of revolt in the order?

707
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,991
Who is to blame for all of this?

708
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:14,061
It is none other than John of the Cross,

709
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:16,130
a wretched little friar

710
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,734
who has plunged us all
into trouble and disunity.

711
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:22,470
- "Come, then, oh beautiful soul.

712
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,507
Since you know now that your
desired Beloved lives hidden

713
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:27,591
in your heart,

714
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,812
strive to be really hidden with Him,

715
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:34,515
and you will embrace Him within you

716
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:37,635
"and experience Him
with loving affection."

717
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:44,992
- Sister, in the face of so many enemies,

718
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:48,329
I have found it impossible
to sit with my hands folded.

719
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:49,671
I've gone to all the authorities.

720
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:52,500
But no one can give me
any idea of his whereabouts.

721
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,536
It's as if he's fallen off
the edge of the earth.

722
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:57,471
Fray John of the Cross is a saint,

723
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:59,957
a treasure who must
be returned immediately.

724
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,110
(sighs) Dear Lord,

725
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,713
you treat your friends
so terribly at times.

726
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,498
It's no wonder you have so few.

727
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:13,120
- During these trying months,

728
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,122
God, in his secret way,

729
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:18,426
converted the most
inactive period of John's life

730
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,444
into the most intense.

731
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:25,099
He was able to make
friends with his kind jailer,

732
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,302
who took pity on his
miserable circumstances

733
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:30,788
and gave him some paper and ink.

734
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,574
(companionable music)

735
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:34,758
And so it was there

736
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,861
in that prison cell

737
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:39,980
that John composed

738
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:45,035
some of the most sublime
and mystical poetry ever written.

if I am destined to die here,

751
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,308
Thy will be done.

752
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:37,681
But, if you want me to escape, inspire me.

753
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:43,103
(lock rattles)

754
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:45,873
(footsteps clack) (rosary beads click)

755
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:48,592
(fretful music)

756
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:54,164
(lock clunks)

757
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:57,768
(door creaks)

758
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:07,561
- Why don't you arise
when I come in to see you?

759
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:09,830
Get up, Fray John of the Cross.

760
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,832
- Excuse me, your Reverence,

761
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:14,234
it is with great
difficultly that I rise now,

762
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:16,170
for I am very weak.

763
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,005
- You will die in this foul tomb

764
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:20,491
if you continue your obstinacy.

765
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,777
This has gone on far too long.

766
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,446
(irritated music)

767
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,197
I don't understand you.

768
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:31,051
What are you thinking, Fray John?

769
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:31,885
- I was thinking

770
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:35,155
that tomorrow is Our Lady's
Feast of the Assumption.

771
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:37,691
And you must know how I must feel.

772
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:39,727
I would be very happy, Father.

773
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:42,396
If I might be able to say Mass.

774
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:43,697
- Not while I'm here.

775
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,566
(imperious music continues)

776
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:47,634
Unless you repent,

777
00:44:47,684 --> 00:44:49,486
you will never say Mass again.

778
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:59,697
Guard, secure the
door. (affectionate music)

779
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:06,320
- [John] "One dark night",

780
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,490
fired with love's urgent longings,

781
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,475
ah, the sheer grace,

782
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,044
I went out unseen,

783
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:17,181
my house being now all stilled.

784
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:26,440
"Oh guiding night,

785
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,610
oh night more lovely than the dawn,

786
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:34,515
oh night that has united
the lover with his beloved,

787
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,701
transforming the beloved in her lover.

788
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:43,590
"Upon my heart,

789
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,043
which I had kept holy for him alone,

790
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:48,946
there he lay sleeping

791
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:52,099
and I caressing him.

792
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:54,818
There in a breeze from the fanning cedars.

793
00:45:57,187 --> 00:46:00,274
When the breeze blew
from the fortress wall,

794
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:01,458
parting his hair,

795
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:04,578
he wounded my neck

796
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:06,029
with his gentle hand,

797
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,399
suspending all my senses.

798
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:17,941
"I abandoned and forgot myself,

799
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:21,912
laying my face on my beloved.

800
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,699
All things ceased.

801
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:28,452
I went out for myself,

802
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:33,757
"leaving my cares
forgotten among the lilies."

803
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:43,250
- [Nun] Mother, there's a man at the gate.

804
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,120
He says he's a friar,
but he's dressed in rags.

805
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:49,356
I tried to turn him away.
But he insists on seeing you.

806
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:50,807
- Very well, I will see him.

807
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,799
(troubled music)

808
00:46:58,849 --> 00:46:59,867
Fray John of the Cross,

809
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:02,302
what have they done to you?

810
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:04,171
- [John] Dear Madre Teresa,

811
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:06,039
I have escaped this night from prison.

812
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:07,574
- (gasps) Oh thanks be to God.

813
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:09,243
But are you being followed?

814
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:10,444
Do they know where you are?

815
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,012
- [John] They soon will, Madre.

816
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:14,189
- [Teresa] Sister, we must
hide Fray John of the Cross

817
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:15,482
in the cleaning room.

818
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:16,316
Hurry now.

819
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:17,935
- [Nun] Yes, Mother.

820
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:22,539
(door raps)

821
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:25,092
(door squeals)

822
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:26,894
- Deo Gracias.

823
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:30,831
- Madre Teresa, we have urgent business.

824
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:33,667
Is, by chance, Fray
John of the Cross here?

825
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:35,636
- (scoffs) Your Reverence,

826
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:39,106
it would be a miracle if you
were to find any friar here.

827
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:42,726
- Are you sure, Madre, absolutely sure?

828
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:44,995
- Yes, Father.

829
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:48,531
- Let us go.

830
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:51,935
Our business here is finished.

831
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:57,825
(aching music)

832
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:01,061
- [Alonso] John would
have to leave the monastery.

833
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:03,864
For only in a distant part of the country

834
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:05,132
could he hope to be safe

835
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:07,885
from the long reach of the calced friars.

836
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:12,372
And so, on the morning of his departure,

837
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:16,777
he spoke to Madre Teresa and the sisters.

838
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:18,362
- My daughters in Christ,

839
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:21,632
did not the Messiah,

840
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:24,835
the Word of God, our Beloved,

841
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,522
have to undergo all these things

842
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,907
so as to enter into his glory?

843
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:35,545
Sisters, I confess

844
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:41,468
that never in my life have
I felt such contentment

845
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:43,537
nor enjoyed such an abundance

846
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:47,107
of supernatural light and sweetness

847
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:48,825
as during my imprisonment.

848
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:55,766
The calced friars are
indeed my great benefactors.

849
00:48:57,401 --> 00:49:02,372
Oh sisters, he that seeks
not the Cross of Christ

850
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,908
seeks not the glory of Christ.

851
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:10,931
Love consists not in feeling great things

852
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:13,734
but in having great detachment

853
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,452
and in suffering for the Beloved.

854
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:19,423
Oh my daughters,

855
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:24,211
let Christ crucified
be sufficient for you.

856
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:27,064
And with Him suffer and take your rest.

857
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:30,984
Be strong in your heart

858
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:32,252
against all things

859
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:35,305
that move you to that which is not God.

860
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:42,245
And for Christ's sake love suffering.

- [Alonso] As the sisters
gazed at him silently,

876
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:57,821
his body was raised above the ground.

877
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:03,226
He stayed there for
an hour of high prayer.

878
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:07,998
(resolute music continues)

879
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,811
When he finally returned to Earth,

880
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:24,731
he said goodbye to the sisters

881
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:26,616
and started on his way.

882
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:45,118
- [John] "Let us rejoice, Beloved",

883
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:48,288
and let us go to see ourselves

884
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:50,272
in your beauty

885
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,458
to the mountain,

886
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:53,160
to the hill,

887
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:56,062
to where the pure water flows,

888
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:59,082
and, further, deep into the thicket.

889
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:03,470
And then we will go on

890
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,406
to the high caverns in the rock

891
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,558
which are so well concealed.

892
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:12,479
There we shall enter

893
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:15,782
and taste the fresh juice

894
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:18,000
of the pomegranates.

895
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:21,655
There you will show me

896
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:24,207
what my soul has been seeking,

897
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:27,594
and then you will give me,

898
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:31,698
you, my Life, will give me there

899
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:34,251
what you gave me on that other day,

900
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:38,855
the breathing of the air,

901
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:42,759
the song of the sweet nightingale,

902
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,980
the grove and its living beauty

903
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,398
in the serene night

904
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:55,839
"with a flame that is
consuming and painless."

905
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:04,681
(intrepid music)

906
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:55,832
(touching music)

907
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:38,541
(companionable music)
