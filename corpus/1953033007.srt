1
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,923
This one? This one? Come on.

2
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:53,215
No, no, no!

3
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,817
Two more, yes?

4
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,215
Yes.

5
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:06,160
Pay heed to Potiphar,
chief steward of the Pharaoh!

6
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:10,627
Quiet! The slave market of Avaris...

7
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:15,739
... crown city of Egypt, home
to the Pharaoh, god to his people...

8
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:20,778
... welcomes the chief steward
and the head of Pharaoh's guards...

9
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:23,644
... the most honored Potiphar!

10
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,751
Potiphar! Potiphar!

11
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,788
I have fine slaves.
Both of them are excellent.

12
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:41,366
Which one do you want?
Which one?

13
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,269
- Do you want one of these?
- No.

14
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,603
No? This one? Look.

15
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,841
There? In the corner?

16
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,250
This one?

17
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,625
This one, sir? He's the best, sir.

18
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:15,331
He's a fine slave, sir.

19
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:18,630
Look at that fine head. Look.
Look at those shoulders.

20
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:23,242
Look at that back.
Those arms. He is perfect.

21
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:28,944
Teeth.

22
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,778
Young.

23
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:35,680
He's healthy enough, but probably
never done a hard day's labor.

24
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:38,684
But he can be trained, master.

25
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:41,987
He... He's submissive. He's obedient.

26
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,187
He would do anything
without a whimper.

27
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:49,700
And he knows his place.
Never opens his mouth except to pray.

28
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,771
Is that true, boy?

29
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,943
Answer the master.

30
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:03,144
And to whom
are these prayers addressed?

31
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:04,882
Which gods?

32
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:08,053
Only one, my lord.

33
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:09,819
Only one god.

34
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,217
Must be very poor indeed.

35
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:26,667
Well, boy?

36
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:31,372
My one God provides
all my needs, my lord.

37
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,579
Well, he hasn't done very well
for you now, has he?

38
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:44,152
These Semites are
a superstitious lot, my lord.

39
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,814
- These what?
- Semites.

40
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:47,961
Semites?

41
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:52,622
Semites. But when they are not praying,
they work very hard.

42
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,997
- Hard workers, are they?
- Yes.

43
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,104
I don't know.
What do you think, overseer?

44
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:03,508
- I could knock the piety out of him, master.
- I know that.

45
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:07,938
When I finish with him,
he'll need a city full of gods.

46
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:12,984
He's young. There would be 10 more
good years in a slave like this.

47
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:28,735
Stupid! We could have made a fortune.
You destroyed the deal.

48
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:30,968
Stupid!

49
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:35,336
Oh, my lord!
Come and have a closer look, my lord.

50
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:07,529
The boy's amusing. For a good price,
I'll take him off your hands.

51
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,575
He wants you! Did you hear that?
He wants you!

52
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:52,304
Come on. Move on!

53
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,163
Move the other way!

54
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:18,269
My name is Ednan.

55
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,500
You...

56
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,642
... sleep here.

57
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:27,113
You bathe each day.

58
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:32,551
The mistress likes her slaves
clean and silent.

59
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:37,179
She sleeps 16 hours a day.

60
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,856
Remember that.

61
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,191
Before work each day...

62
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,459
... we give praise to Amun...

63
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,863
... father of all gods.

64
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,767
And praise is how
you begin your life here.

65
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,868
Praise to the all-powerful Amun!

66
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,341
Praise to the all-powerful Amun.

67
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,538
Praise to the all-powerful Amun!

68
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:05,014
Praise to the all-powerful Amun.

69
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:10,115
I thought you were pious, boy.

70
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,660
Are you too good to praise our god?

71
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,655
No, master. Not too good.

72
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,723
Then what?

73
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:25,528
I've... I've only ever prayed
to the God of my fathers.

74
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:30,710
Well, you won't find him in Egypt.

75
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:34,278
Don't you think you could use
Amun's good graces?

76
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,114
I need workers, boy...

77
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:40,583
... not holy men.

78
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:45,688
I'll just have to teach you
to learn respect for my gods.

79
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:56,163
Now, sleep! All of you!

80
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,038
Move! Move!

81
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:14,076
Don't go near the water.

82
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,447
Come with me.

83
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:22,324
All of you, stack them in the shade.

84
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:29,127
Fill the urn with water.

85
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:32,498
Run, holy boy, run!

86
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,138
I said, run!

87
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,218
Come on, boy.

88
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,265
Where's your god now?

89
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:07,298
He doesn't seem very powerful to me.

90
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,902
Are you ready to praise Amun yet?

91
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,442
Not ready?

92
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,085
You spilled the water!

93
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:25,281
Refill the urn. Now.

94
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:34,065
It's a fight you want, is it?

95
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:54,049
Come on. Put your backs into it.

96
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,221
Get back.

97
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:27,179
I gave you very definite instructions.

98
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,379
- But I thought...
- All of this area should've been cleared.

99
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:33,890
- Look at this here.
- What are you doing, fool?

100
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,494
Put the bricks against that wall,
not this one.

101
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:39,791
Quiet, man. It is the slave who is right.
They do go here.

102
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:43,697
The soil over there is too porous.
The shrine would sink in a month.

103
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,268
We'd both lose our heads.

104
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,131
Keep to the plans, Ednan.

105
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:51,106
Follow the dimensions
exactly as I've written them.

106
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,245
It's simple enough.

107
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:28,642
It's no good to me.
I can't read, idiot.

108
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,715
I can.

109
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:37,749
A slave who can read?

110
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,276
According to this, we begin here.

111
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:08,076
That slave, who is he?

112
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:10,489
Joseph the Semite, mistress.

113
00:13:11,192 --> 00:13:13,752
And he understands drawings?

114
00:13:13,928 --> 00:13:15,293
Yes, mistress.

115
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,158
Explain his bruises.

116
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:21,363
Well, I...

117
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:26,870
A slave's life, mistress.
His lot is no different than any other.

118
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,134
Well, it should be.

119
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:33,812
A good foreman would see
that this is a special man.

120
00:14:40,848 --> 00:14:44,750
My wife wishes
to compliment you, architect.

121
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,284
- The garden is an absolute marvel.
- It's quite lovely.

122
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:53,585
Thank you, mistress.
I wish only to serve.

123
00:14:53,761 --> 00:14:55,695
You've served well.

124
00:14:55,863 --> 00:14:58,093
I owe you a special gift.

125
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:00,256
Name a prize.

126
00:15:01,402 --> 00:15:03,336
If it's not too forward...

127
00:15:03,504 --> 00:15:07,406
... I should like to buy
one of your slaves.

128
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:11,874
The one who can understand drawings,
the Semite.

129
00:15:12,613 --> 00:15:15,776
Potiphar, I thought you said
you favored him.

130
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,747
- I did?
- Yes.

131
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:22,651
And the good architect is correct.
We underuse a slave of his skills.

132
00:15:22,823 --> 00:15:26,589
His manner is gentle,
a quality lost on ordinary labor.

133
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,958
- Bring the Semite slave.
- Semite! Here!

134
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:36,332
They tell me I did well
the day I purchased you.

135
00:15:36,804 --> 00:15:40,638
I am grateful, master, that God
chose to be gracious to us both.

136
00:15:40,808 --> 00:15:43,743
- What?
- Surely you remember, master.

137
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:46,311
He speaks incessantly of his god.

138
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,671
I'd be careful if I were you.

139
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:51,841
You worship as you like
in Canaan, but in Egypt...

140
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:55,420
... only Pharaoh, son of Ra, is god.

141
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:57,781
Is this insolence, boy?

142
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:00,425
- No, master.
- Good.

143
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:05,691
I serve you with humility and honest labor,
but I cannot deny my God.

144
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:09,131
A slave who insists on his own ways.

145
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,897
What do you make of that, wife?

146
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:16,270
We have enough fools who pander to us.
If the estate is to grow...

147
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:20,539
... an honest slave who can read drawings
and cipher is a valuable addition...

148
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:23,376
... especially if we taught him
our own writing.

149
00:16:23,684 --> 00:16:26,152
You see the respect...

150
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,812
... Pharaoh's chief steward
commands in his own home?

151
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,787
Slaves instruct him on religion...

152
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:34,427
... his wife tells him
how to run his household...

153
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:38,190
A good wife keeps her wits about
and draws attention to what is good.

154
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,856
And you see the slave as good?

155
00:16:41,135 --> 00:16:43,569
They say whatever he touches flourishes.

156
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:45,602
Is this true?

157
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:47,334
It is, my lord.

158
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,306
Do you have a name?

159
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:54,177
I am Joseph, master.
Joseph, son of Jacob.

160
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:57,408
Well, Joseph, son of Jacob...

161
00:16:57,584 --> 00:17:00,678
... do you think you could bring
some order to my house...

162
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,845
... if I brought you out of the fields?

163
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:07,552
To be out of the fields, master,
I can do anything.

164
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,193
Then out of the fields you shall be.

165
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:13,527
We'll see just how matters flourish
under your hands...

166
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,328
... or the hand of your god.

167
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:21,339
You'll have to name another prize.

168
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:31,508
We've already got as much in store
as the whole of last year's harvest...

169
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:34,272
... and there's still plenty
left in the fields.

170
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:37,315
Joseph, how do you do it?

171
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:41,020
Ednan, I don't create the crops
for harvest.

172
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:44,453
Must be.
I know Potiphar thinks you do.

173
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,992
Why else would he dress you in robes
as fine as these?

174
00:18:48,162 --> 00:18:51,290
Clothes mean nothing.
I'm still a slave.

175
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:27,366
Mistress, please.
You should not be here.

176
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:29,960
Really?

177
00:19:30,304 --> 00:19:35,571
Has my husband elevated you to a position
where you can tell me where I belong?

178
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,310
No, mistress, of course not.

179
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:42,108
Then be still.

180
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,686
You have some dust...

181
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:51,288
... on your shoulder.

182
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:55,952
Here, let me splash it off for you.

183
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,898
Come on.

184
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:10,076
You work hard...

185
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:13,370
... and you have the muscles to prove it.

186
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:21,114
I am told the barley harvest
is even bigger than last season's.

187
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:23,381
Yes, mistress.

188
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,825
Joseph the golden.

189
00:20:30,864 --> 00:20:36,928
My husband is convinced that your god
is behind all of his success...

190
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:43,634
... that you are the key to everything
he's ever hoped for.

191
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,608
My God provides for me.

192
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:55,115
Would he grant my wishes
if I were your friend?

193
00:20:57,057 --> 00:21:03,394
Please, mistress. I'm only flesh and blood,
and you press the limits of my strength.

194
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,023
You dare restrain me?

195
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:09,066
If my master knew why,
he would understand.

196
00:21:09,236 --> 00:21:10,760
Really?

197
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:14,934
Is it my fault you lured me here
to take advantage of me?

198
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,372
He knows me better than that.

199
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:23,948
It's my word against that of a slave.

200
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:45,437
Joseph.

201
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,637
Come...

202
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,436
... lie with me.

203
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,475
Impossible.

204
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:55,979
Potiphar has entrusted me
with all that is his.

205
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:59,380
The only thing I cannot touch is you.

206
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:05,187
How could I betray your husband's trust
and sin against God?

207
00:22:09,363 --> 00:22:11,558
The time will come.

208
00:22:37,591 --> 00:22:39,286
Joseph.

209
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:43,189
Mistress.

210
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:45,326
Joseph.

211
00:22:45,499 --> 00:22:47,865
I thought we understood each other.

212
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:51,265
Oh, I understood you...

213
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:54,100
... but I think you misjudged me.

214
00:22:54,274 --> 00:22:59,143
So I've decided to give you
a second chance.

215
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,744
Stop!

216
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,261
Where is he?

217
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:03,209
What my wife's maidservant
ran to tell me, is it true?

218
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:09,210
Would you have me call
your own wife a liar, master?

219
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,993
Potiphar! What took you so long?

220
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:31,160
- Didn't my maid tell you of the pain I'm in?
- Yes, of course she did.

221
00:24:31,338 --> 00:24:34,364
Of course, my love,
but the Pharaoh has first call...

222
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,304
... on his chief steward's time.

223
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:39,343
Anyway, I'm here now.
I'm here now...

224
00:24:39,513 --> 00:24:42,380
... and will right any wrong
that has been done.

225
00:24:46,453 --> 00:24:49,251
L... I was alone...

226
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:51,417
... and...

227
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:53,523
... he came here...

228
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:56,590
- He came to my chamber.
- On what excuse?

229
00:24:56,763 --> 00:25:01,598
That's exactly what I said,
but he just laughed at me.

230
00:25:01,768 --> 00:25:04,601
He said he needed no excuse...

231
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:07,069
... that he was your chief steward...

232
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:12,701
... and that I had to do what he said,
or it would be the worse for me.

233
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:18,479
He grabbed my arms.
He forced himself upon me.

234
00:25:18,652 --> 00:25:22,349
L... I screamed, and I pushed him away.

235
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:25,514
And then I scratched wildly at him.

236
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:28,354
- You scratched him?
- Yes.

237
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:33,795
With the power of the goddess
Bastet with me, I drove him out!

238
00:25:36,303 --> 00:25:37,895
I see.

239
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,976
I want...

240
00:25:44,144 --> 00:25:49,013
... the full measure of the law, husband.

241
00:25:49,182 --> 00:25:50,911
The full measure!

242
00:25:51,084 --> 00:25:54,417
I want his death.

243
00:25:54,588 --> 00:25:57,182
Go! Leave me with the slave.

244
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:00,517
Come.

245
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:11,863
- I thought I could trust you.
- But you can, master.

246
00:26:16,543 --> 00:26:19,535
If anyone approaches,
keep your hands behind you.

247
00:26:19,713 --> 00:26:22,409
- Thank you, master.
- Now explain yourself.

248
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:26,951
- How, master?
- She accuses you of the vilest crime...

249
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,715
... and demands the full measure of the law,
which means your head.

250
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,688
A man guilty of that crime
would deserve nothing less.

251
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,953
- So you deny it?
- Yes, of course.

252
00:26:36,129 --> 00:26:38,825
But who would believe a slave
pleading for his life?

253
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:42,462
I deserve better than that from you!

254
00:26:42,636 --> 00:26:45,104
I've treated you more like a son
than a slave.

255
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,102
Trusted my entire estate to you.

256
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:50,470
Made you the law of my house
in my absence. You, a slave!

257
00:26:50,644 --> 00:26:52,236
Your lands prospered under me.

258
00:26:52,412 --> 00:26:56,280
I'd rather not see you dead.
It would take years to find another like you.

259
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,785
Is there nothing you can say
in your defense?

260
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:06,314
Only if you allow me to speak openly,
as though I were a free man.

261
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:12,126
So be it.

262
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:17,933
But on this occasion only, and no one must
ever know I allowed you such a liberty.

263
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:19,765
You know you can trust me.

264
00:27:19,939 --> 00:27:22,965
I'd never betray you,
not after the goodness you've shown.

265
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:25,668
Isn't forcing yourself
on my wife a betrayal?

266
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:30,145
Of course. And I repeat,
I would never betray you.

267
00:27:35,922 --> 00:27:39,289
- You're saying my wife's a liar.
- That's not my place, master.

268
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:42,155
But whatever happened to her
was not by my hand.

269
00:27:42,629 --> 00:27:44,927
I could not do such a thing.

270
00:27:47,434 --> 00:27:49,527
No, no, you couldn't.

271
00:27:49,703 --> 00:27:52,604
It goes against everything
I've ever seen in you.

272
00:27:52,772 --> 00:27:55,764
By all the gods, why this now...

273
00:27:55,942 --> 00:27:58,536
... when things were going
so well for my house?

274
00:27:58,712 --> 00:28:00,839
Give me a reason to believe you.

275
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:08,878
When the blood runs hot, a man forgets
his acts have consequences.

276
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:11,853
I have seen the evil
that comes from rape!

277
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:16,587
It is hateful to me,
and an abomination in the eyes of God!

278
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:23,900
Tell me more.

279
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:26,771
Tell me more.

280
00:28:28,441 --> 00:28:33,572
Give me a way of proving
this isn't the way of a man like you.

281
00:28:37,117 --> 00:28:40,211
These are old memories, master.

282
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:46,186
Thoughts of a better time
before my slavery.

283
00:28:47,761 --> 00:28:49,922
And thoughts of a great pain.

284
00:28:53,366 --> 00:28:57,735
If you value your life, Joseph,
you'll share them with me.

285
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:09,239
I was only a child.

286
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:14,751
And a happ y one in so many ways.

287
00:29:20,794 --> 00:29:23,354
Father! Father!

288
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:29,160
<i>During a long and hard journey, </i>
<i>the Lord, our God, watched over us... </i>

289
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:33,738
<i>... and brought us to a fertile plain</i>
<i>near the Hivite town of Shechem. </i>

290
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:38,072
Joseph.

291
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:40,407
Gather the others.

292
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:45,244
<i>Here my father, Jacob, </i>
<i>said we should raise our tents. </i>

293
00:29:48,388 --> 00:29:50,754
Quick. Father says you must come.

294
00:29:50,924 --> 00:29:53,119
<i>There were my 10 brothers:</i>

295
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:54,920
<i>Reuben... </i>

296
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:56,857
<i>... Simeon... </i>

297
00:29:57,163 --> 00:29:58,596
<i>... Levi... </i>

298
00:29:58,765 --> 00:30:00,562
<i>... and Judah. </i>

299
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:04,967
<i>Dan... </i>

300
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:06,696
<i>... Naphtali... </i>

301
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:09,770
<i>... Gad and Asher. </i>

302
00:30:11,778 --> 00:30:13,211
<i>Issacar... </i>

303
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:15,313
<i>... Zebulon. </i>

304
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:18,613
It's time! It's time! It's time!

305
00:30:18,785 --> 00:30:24,451
<i>And there were his wives:</i>
<i>Leah, who bore my father's first sons. </i>

306
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:30,894
<i>Rachel, my mother, </i>
<i>the one my father loved most. </i>

307
00:30:31,064 --> 00:30:34,693
<i>And the handmaids, Zilpah and Bilah. </i>

308
00:30:35,068 --> 00:30:37,696
<i>And my sister, Dinah. </i>

309
00:30:48,815 --> 00:30:51,215
<i>It was a happy time, master. </i>

310
00:30:51,384 --> 00:30:54,842
<i>A feeling we had finally come home. </i>

311
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:00,059
The Lord is truly our shepherd.

312
00:31:00,226 --> 00:31:04,253
He has fulfilled the promise
made to me at Beth-El...

313
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:09,327
... and has led us safely back
to the land of my fathers.

314
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:12,467
The Lord is my God...

315
00:31:12,906 --> 00:31:15,272
... the God of Israel.

316
00:31:39,766 --> 00:31:41,597
Who are they?

317
00:32:06,326 --> 00:32:11,423
I am Hamor, King of Shechem,
which lies behind those walls.

318
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:16,694
This is Bera, my counsel,
and this is my son, also named Shechem...

319
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:20,066
... so there's no doubt as to what
the future holds for our city.

320
00:32:20,707 --> 00:32:23,540
I am Jacob, also called Israel...

321
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,940
... and these are my people.

322
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:30,379
We come in peace, in search of a land
our God promised would be home for us.

323
00:32:30,751 --> 00:32:33,311
I see. And which god is that?

324
00:32:34,688 --> 00:32:37,953
- We have only one.
- Just one?

325
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:40,855
You must be a people
very short on feasts.

326
00:32:42,363 --> 00:32:46,197
- Our Lord provides.
- Indeed he does.

327
00:32:46,934 --> 00:32:48,902
Indeed he does.

328
00:32:49,703 --> 00:32:53,434
It was to him you dedicated
the sacrifice?

329
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:56,272
But where's the idol?

330
00:32:56,443 --> 00:33:00,607
I'd like to see a single god who could
provide for you as well as this one has.

331
00:33:01,215 --> 00:33:03,479
We keep no graven images.

332
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,414
Even so, we know he is always with us.

333
00:33:09,123 --> 00:33:12,149
You'll find we're friendly people.

334
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:16,518
And if you also come in peace,
we welcome you to camp near our city...

335
00:33:16,697 --> 00:33:19,928
... to find the home
your single god promised.

336
00:33:20,234 --> 00:33:22,998
We come only in peace.

337
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:27,038
And we intend to pay full measure
for the land and the use of the spring.

338
00:33:27,207 --> 00:33:29,198
Just name the price.

339
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:33,211
One-tenth of your grain
and of your flocks...

340
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,941
... and a third of the animals' increase
for five years.

341
00:33:43,557 --> 00:33:45,115
Done.

342
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:53,022
And I thank you for your kindness.
We shall be worthy neighbors.

343
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,964
Neighbors, yes. Strangers, no.

344
00:33:56,136 --> 00:33:58,696
In a week, we honor
the goddess Astarte...

345
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:02,171
... with a marriage followed by
a grand feast. You must join us.

346
00:34:02,342 --> 00:34:03,570
But we're so many.

347
00:34:03,744 --> 00:34:07,145
Then at least some representatives.

348
00:34:09,416 --> 00:34:11,179
Your sons.

349
00:34:11,351 --> 00:34:13,785
Perhaps the young girl here.

350
00:34:13,954 --> 00:34:18,323
Your invitation is kind. Count upon
some of us being among your number.

351
00:34:28,602 --> 00:34:32,060
I don't like it.
They're fat townspeople.

352
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,003
I say we keep our distance.
If they give us trouble...

353
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:37,643
Always the sword, Simeon.

354
00:34:37,811 --> 00:34:41,008
- Is the hard way the only way you know?
- It's the surest way.

355
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:44,412
No. The only sure way
is the way of the Lord.

356
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:48,786
As he has brought us thus far,
he will continue to guide us.

357
00:35:08,308 --> 00:35:11,471
Leah! Bilah! Zilpah! Quick!

358
00:35:12,312 --> 00:35:13,574
It's nothing.

359
00:35:13,747 --> 00:35:15,237
It's nothing.

360
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:18,213
This new child keeps telling me
he's almost ready.

361
00:35:18,385 --> 00:35:21,377
- Are you all right?
- Yes, it's nothing. Go.

362
00:35:21,555 --> 00:35:24,956
- Go. It's nothing.
- Go. It's all right. Go.

363
00:35:26,393 --> 00:35:30,955
You must take better care of yourself.
You don't need to be doing this heavy work.

364
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:34,931
It's better that I work. There's
enough anger boiling under the surface.

365
00:35:35,102 --> 00:35:37,332
Under the surface is where it will stay.

366
00:35:37,504 --> 00:35:40,496
Why settle here, pay more
for the land than it's worth...

367
00:35:40,674 --> 00:35:43,165
... if not to let you rest
before you give birth?

368
00:35:43,343 --> 00:35:46,369
Because it's also proof
that the promises are coming true.

369
00:35:46,547 --> 00:35:49,675
We will inherit the land that God
promised to Abraham.

370
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:54,719
I know you accepted his terms so I could
be settled when I have our second child...

371
00:35:54,888 --> 00:35:58,517
... but, Jacob, the others know it too.

372
00:35:58,692 --> 00:36:02,025
Rachel, I've made no secret
of my love for you.

373
00:36:02,196 --> 00:36:06,599
I never have.
You're first in my eye and my heart.

374
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:09,094
Second, Jacob. Second.

375
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:11,829
Joseph comes first with you.

376
00:38:03,717 --> 00:38:05,776
Wait, my dear.

377
00:38:05,952 --> 00:38:08,512
- You're Jacob's daughter, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

378
00:38:11,258 --> 00:38:13,419
Let's sit here.

379
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:22,530
- No, thank you.
- Now, enjoy yourself.

380
00:38:22,703 --> 00:38:24,694
This is a feast.

381
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:04,777
Oh, poor girl.
Are you all right, my dear?

382
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,976
Don't worry. I'll see to her.

383
00:39:16,556 --> 00:39:20,117
You need a quiet moment
to gather yourself together.

384
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:25,055
You'll be fine.
I'll take you to a cool room for a rest.

385
00:39:29,202 --> 00:39:31,227
You need to rest.

386
00:39:31,405 --> 00:39:33,839
Lie down here for a while.

387
00:39:36,643 --> 00:39:38,736
You'll be fine.

388
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:04,801
Don't be frightened. It's only me.

389
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:06,963
Yes.

390
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:10,439
I mean, I'm not frightened.

391
00:40:10,844 --> 00:40:13,210
You're perfectly safe.

392
00:40:13,447 --> 00:40:18,282
Nobody as beautiful as you
could ever really be in danger.

393
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:26,484
You're a woman who can have
anything she wants.

394
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,150
Yes.

395
00:40:28,562 --> 00:40:31,122
Well, not really a woman.
Just a girl, really.

396
00:40:31,298 --> 00:40:33,459
No, a woman...

397
00:40:35,302 --> 00:40:38,760
... whose face haunts me at night...

398
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:41,774
... whose smell makes my head spin.

399
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:44,672
Please. I have to go.
I shouldn't be here.

400
00:40:44,845 --> 00:40:47,575
This is exactly where you belong.

401
00:40:47,747 --> 00:40:49,237
With me.

402
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:52,681
Stay away. My brothers. Simeon!

403
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:28,015
There's no excuse for what my son did
to your daughter...

404
00:41:28,555 --> 00:41:30,523
... to all of you...

405
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:35,724
... other than that he was drunk with love.
- What?! It's outrageous!

406
00:41:35,896 --> 00:41:39,957
The crime shames us,
violates all laws and traditions.

407
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:42,067
No love can come from violence!

408
00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:45,961
I gave you my trust, my friendship.

409
00:41:47,107 --> 00:41:49,405
Please, Jacob, listen.

410
00:41:49,576 --> 00:41:51,339
I'm asking for your daughter.

411
00:41:52,746 --> 00:41:56,079
I ask for her in marriage to my son.

412
00:42:04,457 --> 00:42:07,324
I'll do anything, whatever you ask.

413
00:42:07,761 --> 00:42:09,626
But I beg you...

414
00:42:10,196 --> 00:42:11,925
... let me marry Dinah.

415
00:42:12,365 --> 00:42:15,493
Your people and mine can be one, Jacob.

416
00:42:16,303 --> 00:42:20,535
We will take your daughters as wives,
and you will take ours.

417
00:42:20,707 --> 00:42:23,505
Then you'll be strangers here no more.

418
00:42:26,947 --> 00:42:31,975
That you seek a peace that can wash away
the stain of violence is good...

419
00:42:32,152 --> 00:42:34,245
... and appreciated.

420
00:42:35,121 --> 00:42:37,282
But our traditions and beliefs...

421
00:42:37,457 --> 00:42:43,589
... demand that we can only marry those
who worship our God, and our God alone.

422
00:42:44,598 --> 00:42:46,998
He's a good god, your god.

423
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:50,159
We see his presence among you,
see how you prosper.

424
00:42:50,337 --> 00:42:53,033
We watched your sacrifice to him.

425
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:58,142
We respect your beliefs,
and we can learn to worship as you do.

426
00:42:58,812 --> 00:43:01,781
And you can embrace all our rituals?

427
00:43:09,356 --> 00:43:12,189
We both have much to think about.

428
00:43:12,993 --> 00:43:15,291
Until tomorrow, perhaps.

429
00:43:15,962 --> 00:43:18,157
Until tomorrow, then.

430
00:43:34,247 --> 00:43:36,772
Be strong, little one.

431
00:43:47,694 --> 00:43:49,821
Is it that simple?

432
00:43:49,996 --> 00:43:54,660
They take our sister for a whore,
and the reward is we embrace them?

433
00:43:54,834 --> 00:43:59,203
Make them family?
Masters of our women's dowries?

434
00:44:00,874 --> 00:44:04,310
- Not if I have a say in it.
- But you don't.

435
00:44:04,477 --> 00:44:09,779
None of us do.
This decision is for our father alone.

436
00:44:10,216 --> 00:44:14,016
I've heard enough.
You're like the women, clucking away.

437
00:44:14,688 --> 00:44:17,088
Good night, brothers.

438
00:44:20,393 --> 00:44:23,521
- He's right, it is Father's decision.
- Yes.

439
00:44:23,697 --> 00:44:27,724
But what happens after that
is something else altogether.

440
00:44:28,902 --> 00:44:29,891
Go on.

441
00:44:30,704 --> 00:44:35,073
Accepting our rituals means
all their males must be circumcised.

442
00:44:35,241 --> 00:44:37,141
And if they are...

443
00:44:37,944 --> 00:44:40,139
They'll be sick.

444
00:44:40,313 --> 00:44:41,302
Weak.

445
00:44:42,382 --> 00:44:43,849
At our mercy.

446
00:44:45,985 --> 00:44:50,183
Get to the pastures. Spread the word.
We'll need every man.

447
00:44:50,356 --> 00:44:52,790
It takes three days
for the fever and weakness.

448
00:44:52,959 --> 00:44:56,656
By the fourth morning it'll have passed,
along with our one chance.

449
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:58,263
Yes.

450
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:13,477
Well, Israel, have you thought upon it?

451
00:45:15,348 --> 00:45:17,077
I have.

452
00:45:18,785 --> 00:45:21,185
And I see great wisdom in your offer.

453
00:45:21,588 --> 00:45:25,888
But have you considered what you must do
to marry amongst us?

454
00:45:26,826 --> 00:45:30,557
Circumcision is a harsh demand
to make of grown men, Jacob.

455
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:33,324
But absolutely necessary.

456
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,992
It is a sign we bear on our flesh
of our covenant with our Lord...

457
00:45:37,537 --> 00:45:40,529
... a proof that we embrace
his commandments.

458
00:45:40,874 --> 00:45:46,972
Only then can we be allowed
to be united through marriage.

459
00:45:53,887 --> 00:45:57,152
So be it. Our men shall be circumcised...

460
00:45:57,557 --> 00:46:00,048
... and we shall be united in peace...

461
00:46:00,426 --> 00:46:02,826
... a new and strong people.

462
00:48:03,182 --> 00:48:05,343
Levi! No!

463
00:48:08,488 --> 00:48:10,456
Come! Come!

464
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:06,242
Madness! Insanity!

465
00:49:06,946 --> 00:49:10,313
How in your hearts
could you have done such a thing?

466
00:49:11,217 --> 00:49:13,913
Ruthless. Merciless.

467
00:49:14,387 --> 00:49:17,618
Is this the good way?
The right way?

468
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:21,252
You have brought ruin upon us.

469
00:49:21,427 --> 00:49:24,624
Someone had to defend Dinah.
She can't be treated as a whore.

470
00:49:24,797 --> 00:49:26,662
She was to be treated like a bride!

471
00:49:28,001 --> 00:49:30,162
You've broken the peace...

472
00:49:30,336 --> 00:49:33,965
... and used our traditions for vengeance.

473
00:49:35,775 --> 00:49:40,610
Now Shechem's neighbors
will join forces against us.

474
00:49:41,114 --> 00:49:43,446
We're so few in number.

475
00:49:48,588 --> 00:49:52,490
Gather our things.
We must leave this place.

476
00:49:52,658 --> 00:49:57,061
We must leave this place!
Gather our things!

477
00:50:20,453 --> 00:50:25,447
<i>And so we were forced to leave the land</i>
<i>that held so much promise. </i>

478
00:50:27,727 --> 00:50:32,289
<i>We went up to Beth-EI, where my father</i>
<i>had once erected a monument to God... </i>

479
00:50:32,465 --> 00:50:35,559
<i>... and again God spoke to him. </i>

480
00:50:35,735 --> 00:50:41,196
<i>As my father told me, the Lord said, </i>
<i>"Be fertile and increase. </i>

481
00:50:41,374 --> 00:50:44,707
<i>A nation, an assembly of nations, </i>
<i>shall descend from you. </i>

482
00:50:44,877 --> 00:50:47,277
<i>Kings shall issue from your loins. </i>

483
00:50:47,447 --> 00:50:51,213
<i>The land I gave Abraham and Isaac</i>
<i>I now give to you. </i>

484
00:50:51,384 --> 00:50:55,616
<i>And to your offspring to come, </i>
<i>I will give this land. "

485
00:51:19,979 --> 00:51:24,177
Push! Push, Rachel, push. Push.

486
00:51:39,532 --> 00:51:41,830
You have another son.

487
00:51:59,352 --> 00:52:01,149
Rachel?

488
00:52:01,888 --> 00:52:04,448
Rachel? Stay awake, Rachel!

489
00:52:04,757 --> 00:52:09,694
- Jacob! My sister, she's dying!
- Rachel!

490
00:52:21,574 --> 00:52:23,542
Call him...

491
00:52:24,744 --> 00:52:26,804
... Ben-Oni.

492
00:52:27,414 --> 00:52:31,043
"Child of pain. "

493
00:52:31,585 --> 00:52:34,884
No. Not Ben-Oni.

494
00:52:35,122 --> 00:52:37,784
Ben-Jamin.

495
00:52:38,091 --> 00:52:40,958
"Child of happiness. "

496
00:53:02,749 --> 00:53:04,114
Joseph! Joseph!

497
00:53:05,686 --> 00:53:07,278
Joseph! Joseph!

498
00:53:07,454 --> 00:53:11,015
Benjamin! Benjamin! Benjamin!

499
00:53:11,191 --> 00:53:14,126
- Joseph!
- Benjamin!

500
00:53:36,183 --> 00:53:37,775
Bilah.

501
00:53:38,752 --> 00:53:41,220
Bilah, spend a moment with me.

502
00:53:41,855 --> 00:53:44,756
- I have work, Reuben.
- But I have things to tell you.

503
00:53:44,925 --> 00:53:46,586
Important things.

504
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,921
Perhaps tomorrow.

505
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:52,526
You know this is my last night.

506
00:53:52,699 --> 00:53:55,361
When Jacob returns,
I must go out with the herds.

507
00:53:55,535 --> 00:53:57,628
- I know.
- So...

508
00:53:57,804 --> 00:54:01,740
... this is my last chance
to speak to you privately.

509
00:54:02,242 --> 00:54:05,302
That's impossible, Reuben.
I belong to your father.

510
00:54:05,479 --> 00:54:09,506
For now, Bilah.
But I am the eldest.

511
00:54:10,717 --> 00:54:13,618
And all the concubines
that belong to him now...

512
00:54:13,787 --> 00:54:18,019
... will belong to me sooner or later.

513
00:54:39,313 --> 00:54:40,940
Bilah.

514
00:54:41,982 --> 00:54:43,574
Bilah.

515
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:45,445
Bilah.

516
00:54:46,787 --> 00:54:49,950
Are you mad? I've got Benjamin
sleeping in here with me.

517
00:54:50,123 --> 00:54:51,954
Come, come.

518
00:55:02,302 --> 00:55:04,361
I thought you should know.

519
00:55:04,638 --> 00:55:08,472
I should send them both away. Go!

520
00:55:09,876 --> 00:55:12,868
How could he do this to me?
How dare he do this to me!

521
00:55:13,046 --> 00:55:17,540
Reuben seduces Bilah, Rachel's
maidservant who bore me children?

522
00:55:18,385 --> 00:55:22,913
- Bilah is like a mother to Benjamin.
- Your sons give me nothing but grief.

523
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:27,220
Forcing us to leave Shechem like...
Like thieves!

524
00:55:27,394 --> 00:55:32,331
Forcing us to take Rachel on a trek
that killed her! And now this?

525
00:55:32,733 --> 00:55:36,692
He was wrong. I know that.
But once you speak to him...

526
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:39,737
No more words! Things must change!

527
00:55:39,906 --> 00:55:43,342
Reuben is my first-born, your first son.

528
00:55:43,977 --> 00:55:46,070
No more words!

529
00:55:59,393 --> 00:56:04,558
One phase of the moon,
then you return to help with the harvest.

530
00:56:04,898 --> 00:56:07,799
Be careful. Be alert.

531
00:56:08,368 --> 00:56:11,804
While you are gone,
Joseph will be in authority.

532
00:56:12,572 --> 00:56:15,905
You will hear his words
as if they were mine.

533
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:18,571
Joseph?

534
00:56:20,547 --> 00:56:23,175
Is this a game, Father?

535
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:27,309
- I am the eldest.
- And the one who shows me no respect.

536
00:56:27,554 --> 00:56:30,614
You and Bilah shamed me
before the entire camp.

537
00:56:30,791 --> 00:56:34,227
Simeon and Levi betrayed
my word at Shechem.

538
00:56:35,362 --> 00:56:39,458
If my sons will not honor me,
I cannot honor them.

539
00:57:21,308 --> 00:57:23,469
Here. Here. Here.
Come here, come here.

540
00:57:23,643 --> 00:57:25,042
What?

541
00:57:25,212 --> 00:57:27,612
- See what Joseph does.
- Make him eat it.

542
00:57:29,349 --> 00:57:31,647
Here he comes now.

543
00:57:33,487 --> 00:57:36,820
- Meat for supper, little brother.
- Meat? From where?

544
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:40,016
A sheep. You can pick the one
for slaughter if you like.

545
00:57:40,193 --> 00:57:44,653
- Me? Never. Father specifically forbade us...
- Well, he's not here, is he?

546
00:57:44,831 --> 00:57:48,528
He's not stuck out here,
baking under the sun, living on dried fruit.

547
00:57:48,702 --> 00:57:51,535
Here's a nice fat one
who'll stick to our ribs.

548
00:57:52,906 --> 00:57:55,568
- But what will you tell Father?
- He won't find out.

549
00:57:55,742 --> 00:57:59,007
- At least, he'd better not.
- No wagging tongues.

550
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:03,582
- You'd lie to him?
- Us? No. We wouldn't lie.

551
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:09,313
It's not our fault if the poor lamb strays off
and gets mauled by a mountain lion.

552
00:58:09,756 --> 00:58:13,089
Understand, little brother?

553
00:58:13,293 --> 00:58:17,059
What difference does it make?
He's got more sheep than anyone in Hebron.

554
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:21,724
- But Father put me in charge of the sheep!
- Sit down and be quiet.

555
00:58:35,315 --> 00:58:37,044
Come on, Joseph.

556
00:58:37,217 --> 00:58:39,117
Have something to eat.

557
00:58:41,454 --> 00:58:43,479
It's only a lamb.

558
00:58:45,025 --> 00:58:48,984
Poor little thing.
Mauled to death by a mountain lion.

559
00:58:50,564 --> 00:58:52,259
Eat.

560
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,593
I'm not hungry.

561
00:58:56,469 --> 00:59:01,065
Look at the hide. Any fool can see
it was killed by a wild animal.

562
00:59:01,241 --> 00:59:04,005
Let's give him a close look. Hey!

563
00:59:07,981 --> 00:59:09,676
Any fool!

564
00:59:09,849 --> 00:59:12,374
Right, brother?

565
00:59:12,552 --> 00:59:15,112
Do you take me for a fool?!

566
00:59:15,288 --> 00:59:17,688
I've been a shepherd my entire life.

567
00:59:17,857 --> 00:59:19,791
I know the problems shepherds face.

568
00:59:20,427 --> 00:59:22,486
- I also know their tricks.
- Father, we...

569
00:59:22,662 --> 00:59:27,156
Silence! Now, take it away.
Get it out of my sight!

570
00:59:32,339 --> 00:59:35,433
At least now we know
what to expect from Joseph.

571
00:59:41,514 --> 00:59:43,209
Betrayal.

572
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:45,278
He's a sp y.

573
00:59:54,995 --> 00:59:58,260
- He certainly looks like a prince.
- So tall and strong.

574
00:59:58,431 --> 01:00:01,298
Oh, Jacob, it's beautifully made.

575
01:00:01,468 --> 01:00:04,995
- Lf only his mother could see him now.
- It's wonderful.

576
01:00:05,171 --> 01:00:07,571
Surely I don't deserve it.

577
01:00:07,741 --> 01:00:10,437
None of his brothers
have anything this fine.

578
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:14,410
None of them deserve it. He does.

579
01:00:14,581 --> 01:00:17,482
He has proven his loyalty
and responsibility.

580
01:00:17,651 --> 01:00:21,951
He has earned the coat,
just as he's earned the succession.

581
01:00:22,288 --> 01:00:25,485
Now, leave me alone with him.
Go, all of you.

582
01:00:25,659 --> 01:00:27,149
Go.

583
01:00:38,505 --> 01:00:42,635
I'm honoring you, Joseph,
naming you my heir...

584
01:00:42,809 --> 01:00:44,834
... next in line as head of the tribe.

585
01:00:47,847 --> 01:00:51,578
- You can count on all your sons, Father.
- Some more than others.

586
01:00:52,385 --> 01:00:54,876
Simeon, Levi, Reuben...

587
01:00:55,055 --> 01:00:57,717
... I can never forget what they did.

588
01:00:58,625 --> 01:01:02,391
The coat is a mark
that you will carry on the line.

589
01:01:03,263 --> 01:01:08,360
When you wear it,
remember, it is a robe of honor.

590
01:01:13,339 --> 01:01:15,432
Now, get some sleep.

591
01:01:15,608 --> 01:01:18,771
We have a lot of work to do.
The harvest starts tomorrow.

592
01:01:38,832 --> 01:01:44,134
Joseph, tell me again
what our mother was like.

593
01:01:46,306 --> 01:01:48,467
She was gentle...

594
01:01:50,477 --> 01:01:53,640
... kind, loving...

595
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,173
... and very beautiful.

596
01:01:56,883 --> 01:02:00,876
More beautiful than Leah,
Zilpah and Bilah?

597
01:02:01,054 --> 01:02:02,612
Yes, much more.

598
01:02:05,191 --> 01:02:08,126
Is it true that I killed her?

599
01:02:08,428 --> 01:02:10,453
Of course not.

600
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:12,495
Where did you ever get
such an idea?

601
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:17,397
I heard some of the women say
that she died because I was born.

602
01:02:19,339 --> 01:02:22,831
That's foolishness, Benjamin.
That's not why she died.

603
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:25,641
Why, then?

604
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:32,650
I don't know why, Benjamin.

605
01:02:36,623 --> 01:02:38,648
People are born...

606
01:02:38,992 --> 01:02:40,482
... live...

607
01:02:40,827 --> 01:02:43,022
... and die.

608
01:02:43,797 --> 01:02:46,265
Even the stars fall and die...

609
01:02:46,432 --> 01:02:50,801
... and the sun sets every day
just to be reborn the next morning.

610
01:02:52,071 --> 01:02:57,236
I wish I'd have known Mother.
I'd never have let her go.

611
01:02:58,077 --> 01:03:00,602
It's not that simple, little brother.

612
01:03:01,047 --> 01:03:04,141
Hush, now. Go to sleep.

613
01:03:06,619 --> 01:03:09,213
Are you going to sleep
in your new coat?

614
01:03:10,757 --> 01:03:12,384
Yes.

615
01:03:13,059 --> 01:03:14,993
I love it so much.

616
01:03:20,867 --> 01:03:24,564
I must sleep now.
Tomorrow's harvest.

617
01:03:24,771 --> 01:03:26,739
Hard work.

618
01:05:02,669 --> 01:05:06,662
So then we all began
to bind our sheaves...

619
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:09,706
... and brought them together
and set them upright.

620
01:05:09,876 --> 01:05:14,506
And as soon as they were on end...

621
01:05:16,282 --> 01:05:20,810
Well, don't stop now.
What happened?

622
01:05:21,988 --> 01:05:23,455
Then...

623
01:05:24,857 --> 01:05:27,087
... your sheaves all prostrated themselves.

624
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:30,559
- They bowed down before mine.
- That's it! I've taken all I can.

625
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:33,062
He's gone crazy
because of Father's promises.

626
01:05:33,232 --> 01:05:36,326
- He already thinks he's our master.
- I also had a dream.

627
01:05:36,502 --> 01:05:38,561
In mine, there were 12 piles of manure.

628
01:05:38,738 --> 01:05:41,468
The smallest one walked and talked
and told tales.

629
01:05:41,641 --> 01:05:45,941
No, be serious.
I've had enough of him.

630
01:05:46,112 --> 01:05:47,875
It's time we had this out.

631
01:05:48,047 --> 01:05:50,675
Tonight, after the day's work.

632
01:05:56,923 --> 01:06:00,017
We'll see what Father thinks about this.

633
01:06:06,632 --> 01:06:09,931
So we all began to bind our sheaves...

634
01:06:10,103 --> 01:06:13,129
... and brought them together
and set them upright.

635
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:16,838
And as soon as they were on end...

636
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:19,069
... their sheaves bowed down
before mine.

637
01:06:19,645 --> 01:06:21,476
Do you hear that, Father?

638
01:06:21,647 --> 01:06:25,583
He dreams of being our master.
This has to be stopped!

639
01:06:25,752 --> 01:06:28,346
Now, that's as foolish a thing
as I've ever heard.

640
01:06:28,521 --> 01:06:32,617
Should I order the boy to stop dreaming?
Dreams have meanings.

641
01:06:32,892 --> 01:06:36,726
And when God intends for us
to understand them, he'll make it all clear.

642
01:06:36,896 --> 01:06:40,593
Until such time, all we can do is listen.

643
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,293
Joseph, you spoke of another dream.

644
01:06:43,770 --> 01:06:45,738
Yes, Father.

645
01:06:45,972 --> 01:06:47,667
Tell us.

646
01:06:49,242 --> 01:06:51,506
I'd better not, I think.

647
01:06:52,278 --> 01:06:55,873
If God gave you a dream,
you must share it with us.

648
01:06:59,886 --> 01:07:04,118
I dreamt the sun and the moon
and the stars paid homage to me.

649
01:07:08,761 --> 01:07:10,558
I don't know what that means.

650
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:13,755
- Am I the sun, perhaps?
- Surely not.

651
01:07:13,933 --> 01:07:16,424
Your mother, the moon?
Your brothers, the stars?

652
01:07:16,602 --> 01:07:19,036
I mean, should we all bow down to you?

653
01:07:20,173 --> 01:07:22,539
Now you've listened to this madness...

654
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:27,304
... perhaps we can go back to the way
things were, the way things ought to be.

655
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,175
Yes, I'm sure you'd like that.

656
01:07:29,348 --> 01:07:32,283
But dreams do not change
what happened at Shechem...

657
01:07:32,452 --> 01:07:34,317
... or with the lambs in the fields.

658
01:07:34,654 --> 01:07:37,418
Dreams do not change my decisions.

659
01:07:57,944 --> 01:08:02,574
I'm sending you to see how the flocks
are doing, not to a feast.

660
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:08,180
Son, you're getting older, bigger...

661
01:08:08,588 --> 01:08:11,352
... and where once your brothers
might resent you...

662
01:08:11,524 --> 01:08:16,086
... as you gain strength and position,
they begin to feel very threatened by you.

663
01:08:16,762 --> 01:08:19,595
I want you to try
and make peace with them.

664
01:08:20,133 --> 01:08:24,832
Yes, Father. That's also what I want,
but sometimes their anger is...

665
01:08:25,438 --> 01:08:29,465
Time will ease that
if you're more careful of their feelings.

666
01:08:30,309 --> 01:08:32,607
Joseph, they're different than you are.

667
01:08:32,778 --> 01:08:36,612
They're all brought up together
like a pack of lion cubs.

668
01:08:36,782 --> 01:08:40,240
You and Benjamin are the children
of my old age.

669
01:08:40,419 --> 01:08:46,722
You were given more attention, perhaps,
but your brothers see that as more love.

670
01:08:47,627 --> 01:08:52,963
We both must help try to make them
see the truth, understand?

671
01:08:53,132 --> 01:08:55,362
- Yes, Father.
- Good.

672
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:58,165
Then go safely and with a steady pace.

673
01:08:58,337 --> 01:09:01,272
You should find them
within a two days' journey.

674
01:09:11,184 --> 01:09:13,778
Each night grows colder
than the one before.

675
01:09:13,953 --> 01:09:16,114
We have another cycle of the moon
before we can return.

676
01:09:16,289 --> 01:09:17,586
I'm in no hurry.

677
01:09:17,757 --> 01:09:21,989
The only thing waiting for us at Hebron
is our new master in his wonderful coat.

678
01:09:22,628 --> 01:09:26,428
Come, little sheaves.
Bow down before the great man, Joseph.

679
01:09:27,033 --> 01:09:28,830
Come on, bow!

680
01:09:29,001 --> 01:09:31,902
Mercy! Mercy, master.
Please have mercy upon us.

681
01:09:32,338 --> 01:09:36,934
- A wild animal tore a little lamb to pieces!
- Please, please!

682
01:09:37,109 --> 01:09:42,513
Oh, we are innocent, O great Joseph.
Please have mercy upon us.

683
01:09:42,915 --> 01:09:46,681
No, my brothers,
I'm in no hurry to see him again.

684
01:09:46,852 --> 01:09:48,581
It's peaceful here.

685
01:09:49,021 --> 01:09:51,421
Unless he comes looking for us.

686
01:09:51,591 --> 01:09:53,889
I think we should move west.

687
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:57,393
What makes you think the pastures
will be better somewhere else?

688
01:09:57,563 --> 01:10:01,192
We'll move west tomorrow,
to the region near Dothan.

689
01:10:01,367 --> 01:10:02,834
The grass is fuller there.

690
01:10:03,002 --> 01:10:07,200
Listen to him give orders
and predict what we'll find.

691
01:10:07,773 --> 01:10:10,298
Must have been a dream.
Runs in the family.

692
01:10:13,613 --> 01:10:16,878
The only thing I dream about is women.

693
01:10:17,049 --> 01:10:21,315
But I do know that if we move on,
no one will know where we are.

694
01:10:21,721 --> 01:10:25,248
And no one will be able to sp y on us.

695
01:10:28,394 --> 01:10:29,725
I agree.

696
01:10:30,496 --> 01:10:32,794
Let anyone who wants to find us...

697
01:10:32,965 --> 01:10:35,126
... have to dream where we are.

698
01:11:01,827 --> 01:11:04,352
What are you looking for?

699
01:11:05,931 --> 01:11:08,058
I'm looking for my brothers.

700
01:11:08,234 --> 01:11:10,725
They're pasturing the flock
somewhere near here.

701
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:15,930
They moved on. I heard them say
they were going to Dothan.

702
01:11:16,742 --> 01:11:18,403
Thank you.

703
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:26,610
Are you sure they went west?

704
01:11:28,888 --> 01:11:32,380
Last night I dreamt I was on
one of those ships that dock in Jaffa.

705
01:11:32,558 --> 01:11:36,494
I had three women. One had red hair,
the other gold, the third...

706
01:11:36,662 --> 01:11:41,031
Your dreams don't count.
You're not Joseph.

707
01:11:42,034 --> 01:11:45,561
I wonder. Father wasn't so pleased
with his last dream.

708
01:11:45,738 --> 01:11:46,727
That's right.

709
01:11:48,007 --> 01:11:49,702
What if they are prophetic?

710
01:11:49,875 --> 01:11:54,778
All of us kneeling down to him,
Father too. Sickening!

711
01:11:54,947 --> 01:11:56,812
Stop it. It's only a dream.

712
01:11:56,982 --> 01:12:00,748
We'll end up bowing and scraping to him,
crawling to beg for favors.

713
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,717
Stop it.

714
01:12:07,259 --> 01:12:08,886
What is it?

715
01:12:10,329 --> 01:12:11,819
Here, brothers.

716
01:12:12,264 --> 01:12:15,097
Look, the dreamer himself.

717
01:12:15,267 --> 01:12:16,734
And in the coat.

718
01:12:17,269 --> 01:12:20,727
I swear, I could rip it from his back.

719
01:12:21,474 --> 01:12:23,840
Father sends you fresh food.

720
01:12:28,715 --> 01:12:31,240
I say we kill him.

721
01:12:31,418 --> 01:12:33,909
- What?
- I say we kill him.

722
01:12:36,056 --> 01:12:38,388
It's the only way to be done with him.

723
01:12:38,558 --> 01:12:42,187
- Hold your tongue. Don't even think it.
- No, no, Simeon is right.

724
01:12:42,362 --> 01:12:44,421
To kill him? Never!

725
01:12:44,598 --> 01:12:46,896
To teach him a lesson,
throw him in a pit...

726
01:12:47,067 --> 01:12:50,468
... but you don't spill your brother's blood!
- It could happen.

727
01:12:50,637 --> 01:12:53,731
A long journey by himself.
Thieves or mountain lions.

728
01:12:53,907 --> 01:12:56,375
No, wait. We tried this with the lamb.

729
01:12:56,843 --> 01:12:59,641
Father saw through it.
Imagine what he'd make of this.

730
01:12:59,813 --> 01:13:02,907
The fact that he caught us
makes this one more believable.

731
01:13:03,083 --> 01:13:06,575
He'd never expect us to lie a second time.
Especially about Joseph.

732
01:13:06,753 --> 01:13:07,981
Brothers!

733
01:13:11,024 --> 01:13:14,824
Well? This is the only chance
you'll ever have to be done with him.

734
01:13:14,995 --> 01:13:17,896
- To assume our rightful place.
- Let's do it!

735
01:13:18,064 --> 01:13:21,192
Have you lost your minds?
You can't spill a brother's blood!

736
01:13:21,435 --> 01:13:24,131
Have you thought of the curse
which will fall on us?

737
01:13:24,304 --> 01:13:26,636
Stop it! Stop it now
before it's too late!

738
01:13:26,807 --> 01:13:28,934
- Stop what?
- Ignore him.

739
01:13:29,109 --> 01:13:32,272
Don't speak to boys who come to work
in grooms' clothing.

740
01:13:32,446 --> 01:13:34,311
You come in search of more tales?

741
01:13:34,481 --> 01:13:38,315
Father wants a report, and he thinks
I'm the one to do the job. He told...

742
01:13:38,485 --> 01:13:42,353
Forget what he told you. Report on me,
and it'll be the last thing you do!

743
01:13:42,522 --> 01:13:44,581
- Simeon!
- I'll do as Father instructed.

744
01:13:44,891 --> 01:13:46,756
- I warn you!
- Simeon, stop it!

745
01:13:46,927 --> 01:13:50,021
I'll do as Father says.
Your warning smells of too much wine.

746
01:13:50,197 --> 01:13:52,461
Hold him back!

747
01:14:26,733 --> 01:14:28,792
Drop him!

748
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:34,139
Don't do it!

749
01:14:42,148 --> 01:14:43,479
I'll remember, brother.

750
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:48,383
I'll remember that when the time came
to act for ourselves, you weren't there.

751
01:14:48,555 --> 01:14:50,045
No, I wasn't.

752
01:14:50,223 --> 01:14:56,389
Perhaps I'm just not as big and brave
as you are, brother.

753
01:14:57,697 --> 01:15:00,461
You're letting him go?
What if he tells our father?

754
01:15:00,634 --> 01:15:03,660
He won't do anything.
Not Reuben.

755
01:15:03,837 --> 01:15:06,397
He stands the most to gain from all this.

756
01:15:06,573 --> 01:15:10,737
With Joseph gone, who else will our father
put in line to replace him?

757
01:15:10,911 --> 01:15:13,641
He'll be back.

758
01:15:18,818 --> 01:15:22,879
I am Joseph, hail to me!

759
01:15:27,727 --> 01:15:30,252
Take it off! Take it off!

760
01:15:43,643 --> 01:15:46,237
Brothers!

761
01:15:49,049 --> 01:15:52,382
Help me, brothers!

762
01:15:52,752 --> 01:15:54,743
Please!

763
01:15:55,689 --> 01:15:58,157
Help me!

764
01:16:01,061 --> 01:16:03,461
Brothers!

765
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:05,860
Grow up, all of you!

766
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:11,803
Sitting and moping like women.
What's done is done.

767
01:16:11,972 --> 01:16:14,202
Now, let's get on with our own business!

768
01:16:14,374 --> 01:16:16,774
- The boy is our business.
- Brothers!

769
01:16:16,943 --> 01:16:18,877
Was, brother, was.

770
01:16:19,045 --> 01:16:21,275
- There's no turning back.
- Lf we pulled him out?

771
01:16:21,448 --> 01:16:23,973
From the well where you
helped me throw him?

772
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:27,017
And have him tell Father what we did?

773
01:16:27,187 --> 01:16:29,178
At least he's not dead.

774
01:16:30,156 --> 01:16:33,557
We could tell Father we were
just trying to teach him a lesson.

775
01:16:33,727 --> 01:16:36,025
And Father will teach us a thing or two.

776
01:16:36,196 --> 01:16:40,462
The flocks are his, the tents,
the food, everything!

777
01:16:40,634 --> 01:16:44,092
I've worked too hard to be disowned
and left with nothing.

778
01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:47,535
No, brother, we'll have
to see this one through...

779
01:16:47,707 --> 01:16:51,507
... because what our father
doesn't know can't hurt us.

780
01:16:53,313 --> 01:16:55,747
Brothers!

781
01:16:58,451 --> 01:17:00,851
Help me!

782
01:17:04,624 --> 01:17:06,751
Father!

783
01:17:08,795 --> 01:17:10,660
Judah!

784
01:17:14,134 --> 01:17:17,695
There's not much grazing left
in these fields.

785
01:17:18,605 --> 01:17:20,630
- Judah!
- Simeon.

786
01:17:20,807 --> 01:17:26,768
I think it best if you and Levi take part of
the flock to fresh pastures near Shechem.

787
01:17:27,113 --> 01:17:31,641
So you can fish out the boy
and throw the blame on us?

788
01:17:32,218 --> 01:17:33,549
Never.

789
01:17:36,656 --> 01:17:39,147
Brothers!

790
01:17:41,161 --> 01:17:43,823
Help me! Gad!

791
01:17:43,997 --> 01:17:47,023
Oh, do something, Simeon,
before we all go insane!

792
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,532
We should have killed him.

793
01:17:50,437 --> 01:17:51,665
I'll shut him up.

794
01:17:55,675 --> 01:17:59,611
- You want to fight me, brother?
- Lf that's what it takes.

795
01:17:59,779 --> 01:18:01,576
But you're not gonna kill him.

796
01:18:02,315 --> 01:18:04,306
And you're not gonna fish him out.

797
01:18:04,484 --> 01:18:07,453
If that's the only way to avoid
his blood on my hands...

798
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:09,178
... then fish him out we will.

799
01:18:10,023 --> 01:18:13,857
To avoid spilling his blood,
you'll have to shed mine...

800
01:18:14,027 --> 01:18:15,688
... if you can.

801
01:18:18,231 --> 01:18:20,699
But I'm a reasonable man.

802
01:18:21,568 --> 01:18:24,935
I'll give you till dawn
to come up with another suggestion.

803
01:18:29,776 --> 01:18:31,835
Help me!

804
01:18:32,011 --> 01:18:34,172
Brothers!

805
01:18:42,088 --> 01:18:44,181
Help me!

806
01:18:46,392 --> 01:18:47,916
Ishmaelite traders.

807
01:18:53,166 --> 01:18:57,398
Now the boy must be killed,
before they hear his damned whining.

808
01:18:57,871 --> 01:19:00,203
- They're the answer!
- Them? How?

809
01:19:00,373 --> 01:19:02,898
They can take him for a slave.
Down to Egypt.

810
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:05,410
He'll live, our hands will be clean.

811
01:19:05,578 --> 01:19:08,809
If he escapes, comes back
and tells Father what happened?

812
01:19:08,982 --> 01:19:11,542
Ishmaelite and Egyptian slaves
don't escape!

813
01:19:11,718 --> 01:19:16,553
They'd pay for him. There's money in it
for all of us, and no blood!

814
01:19:17,190 --> 01:19:18,589
Father!

815
01:19:31,171 --> 01:19:34,140
- Twenty shekels, not a piece more.
- In silver?

816
01:19:34,307 --> 01:19:35,865
Of course.

817
01:19:36,976 --> 01:19:38,307
Done.

818
01:19:46,619 --> 01:19:49,179
What? What is it?

819
01:19:52,759 --> 01:19:54,124
Brothers!

820
01:19:55,228 --> 01:19:58,163
Brothers, help me! Please!

821
01:19:58,631 --> 01:20:01,725
Brothers! Brothers!

822
01:20:03,503 --> 01:20:06,370
Help me!

823
01:20:30,864 --> 01:20:32,627
Come to save him?

824
01:20:32,799 --> 01:20:35,495
I won't have his blood on my hands.

825
01:20:36,069 --> 01:20:38,629
It's too late for that.

826
01:21:21,848 --> 01:21:24,180
We found this on the road.

827
01:21:25,752 --> 01:21:27,913
He must have gotten lost.

828
01:21:28,721 --> 01:21:30,746
Wild animal.

829
01:21:32,492 --> 01:21:35,984
No. No!

830
01:21:36,162 --> 01:21:39,461
No! No!

831
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,195
No!

832
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:50,800
No!

833
01:21:58,117 --> 01:22:02,713
What's left to me if Joseph is dead?

834
01:22:11,597 --> 01:22:15,465
Joseph! Joseph!

835
01:22:56,134 --> 01:22:59,729
Here, then, master,
is my version of events.

836
01:23:00,505 --> 01:23:05,841
And may the Lord, my God,
stand by me as I speak only truth...

837
01:23:06,044 --> 01:23:08,478
... and desert me if I lie.

838
01:23:10,215 --> 01:23:12,843
If you lie, I will kill you.

839
01:23:15,754 --> 01:23:19,121
It was the last day
of the harvest festival...

840
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:21,759
... the gratitude to the gods.

841
01:23:22,561 --> 01:23:26,964
<i>I set about arranging the house, </i>
<i>believing it to be empty. </i>

842
01:23:33,972 --> 01:23:35,633
Joseph.

843
01:23:37,876 --> 01:23:39,605
Mistress.

844
01:23:39,912 --> 01:23:41,641
Joseph.

845
01:23:41,813 --> 01:23:44,179
I thought we understood each other.

846
01:23:44,349 --> 01:23:47,648
Oh, I understood you...

847
01:23:47,819 --> 01:23:50,481
... but I think you misjudged me.

848
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:55,491
So I've decided to give you
a second chance.

849
01:23:59,364 --> 01:24:01,093
Stop!

850
01:24:02,734 --> 01:24:04,793
Oh, Joseph.

851
01:24:07,906 --> 01:24:13,105
Perhaps... Perhaps if we talked more...

852
01:24:13,845 --> 01:24:17,542
... became close...

853
01:24:18,650 --> 01:24:21,847
... perhaps you might see me differently.

854
01:24:23,188 --> 01:24:27,955
You might see how melancholy I am.

855
01:24:28,126 --> 01:24:32,586
My husband is so busy all the time.

856
01:24:32,764 --> 01:24:36,063
Loneliness is a terrible thing, Joseph.

857
01:24:36,234 --> 01:24:38,702
I know you hurt, but...

858
01:24:40,405 --> 01:24:44,307
Oh, you are not a common man.

859
01:24:45,978 --> 01:24:49,209
Where does the mystery
come from with you?

860
01:24:50,148 --> 01:24:52,548
Where are you from?

861
01:24:52,718 --> 01:24:55,414
This house is my home now.

862
01:24:57,489 --> 01:25:00,014
Tell me about your father.

863
01:25:00,792 --> 01:25:03,488
You once said he was a prince.

864
01:25:04,629 --> 01:25:08,292
Does he have many herds of animals?

865
01:25:08,467 --> 01:25:11,868
- Servants, fields?
- Yes.

866
01:25:13,805 --> 01:25:16,603
So he's a powerful man.

867
01:25:17,609 --> 01:25:20,134
Do you think he's happ y
with his wealth?

868
01:25:20,479 --> 01:25:24,506
I don't think my father's wealth
brings him much joy.

869
01:25:25,784 --> 01:25:27,877
Then what would?

870
01:25:30,222 --> 01:25:33,214
I expect if he could see me again.

871
01:25:35,394 --> 01:25:38,761
You know, your freedom
is within my gift.

872
01:25:38,964 --> 01:25:40,659
Yes.

873
01:25:44,302 --> 01:25:48,102
But I can't. It would offend God.

874
01:25:49,674 --> 01:25:52,370
You know you want me.

875
01:25:52,878 --> 01:25:54,641
Look how you're shaking.

876
01:25:54,813 --> 01:25:57,976
You want me as much as I want you.

877
01:25:59,451 --> 01:26:01,214
Come, Joseph.

878
01:26:01,386 --> 01:26:03,911
Come lie with me.

879
01:26:05,190 --> 01:26:07,090
Leave me!

880
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:09,488
Stop!

881
01:26:09,761 --> 01:26:13,720
Who do you think you are, you fool?

882
01:26:13,899 --> 01:26:17,494
You dare lay a hand on your mistress?

883
01:26:19,237 --> 01:26:22,764
My husband would kill you for this.

884
01:26:36,254 --> 01:26:38,017
Is that all?

885
01:26:39,958 --> 01:26:42,984
As I swear before the Lord, my God.

886
01:27:21,666 --> 01:27:24,032
Summon the household.

887
01:27:34,546 --> 01:27:35,535
Good.

888
01:27:36,348 --> 01:27:38,782
Let them all hear him sentenced...

889
01:27:39,551 --> 01:27:41,280
... to death.

890
01:27:58,937 --> 01:28:02,873
I have heard the reports
and weighed them.

891
01:28:03,909 --> 01:28:05,137
The slave is guilty.

892
01:28:06,178 --> 01:28:08,669
Here, then, is my decision.

893
01:28:09,281 --> 01:28:12,079
As I say it, so it be written,
so it be done.

894
01:28:13,418 --> 01:28:17,878
The slave is to be taken to the Pharaoh's
prison and held there at my pleasure.

895
01:28:18,323 --> 01:28:22,123
The jailer is to report to me weekly
on his treatment and his progress.

896
01:28:24,863 --> 01:28:28,128
Thus is this matter now closed.

897
01:28:45,550 --> 01:28:47,347
Bring him.

898
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:17,380
You humiliated me.

899
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:21,913
You sent him to prison at your pleasure?

900
01:29:22,887 --> 01:29:25,549
What about my honor?

901
01:29:26,925 --> 01:29:29,951
- What honor?
- How dare you.

902
01:29:30,228 --> 01:29:32,423
I know you, wife.

903
01:29:35,433 --> 01:29:36,832
I know you.

904
01:29:38,803 --> 01:29:41,738
You don't understand.

905
01:29:45,477 --> 01:29:49,277
Whatever you believe of me...

906
01:29:51,383 --> 01:29:54,716
... how can you let him live?

907
01:29:56,254 --> 01:29:59,189
How can you humiliate me like that?

908
01:30:03,161 --> 01:30:06,324
Because one humiliation
deserves another.

909
01:30:11,870 --> 01:30:13,804
Wife...

910
01:30:15,173 --> 01:30:18,768
... anyone who knows Joseph
also knows that if he swears by his god...

911
01:30:18,943 --> 01:30:20,638
... he's telling the truth.

912
01:30:21,346 --> 01:30:24,247
What is more important to you?

913
01:30:25,350 --> 01:30:27,375
His god...

914
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:32,581
... or my good name?
- The truth.

915
01:30:34,225 --> 01:30:35,658
Truth.

916
01:30:36,461 --> 01:30:38,622
Yes, that's what matters.

917
01:30:39,798 --> 01:30:41,425
Well, then...

918
01:30:42,233 --> 01:30:46,067
... you might as well set him free...

919
01:30:46,905 --> 01:30:49,203
... and complete my shame.

920
01:30:57,782 --> 01:30:59,807
Wherever he is...

921
01:31:00,885 --> 01:31:03,217
... whatever happens to him...

922
01:31:04,055 --> 01:31:05,989
... he is free.

923
01:31:07,859 --> 01:31:10,384
Because his god is with him.

924
01:31:38,356 --> 01:31:40,551
Get in there! Come on!

925
01:31:40,725 --> 01:31:42,420
Move!

926
01:31:52,771 --> 01:31:54,966
God!

927
01:31:56,007 --> 01:31:58,567
My God!

928
01:31:59,310 --> 01:32:02,302
Why have you forsaken me?

929
01:32:04,482 --> 01:32:06,814
God!

930
01:34:28,227 --> 01:34:32,857
Pay heed to Potiphar,
chief steward of the Pharaoh.

931
01:34:37,169 --> 01:34:40,195
- Peace be with you, master.
- Do you know about this?

932
01:34:40,372 --> 01:34:43,000
The warder said only to expect
two new prisoners.

933
01:34:43,475 --> 01:34:46,842
The excellence of your work here
is becoming common knowledge.

934
01:34:47,012 --> 01:34:50,345
They say the prisoners
have never eaten better.

935
01:34:50,516 --> 01:34:52,381
The warder's never been richer.

936
01:34:52,551 --> 01:34:56,009
The Pharaoh has never had to spend less
to keep his jails running.

937
01:34:56,188 --> 01:34:58,748
Ten times a day,
I'm asked how you do it.

938
01:34:58,924 --> 01:35:02,621
- God blesses my work, master.
- As I've seen for myself.

939
01:35:02,795 --> 01:35:05,593
I know that one day
he'll see me gone from this place.

940
01:35:05,764 --> 01:35:10,360
He'll have to deal with the Pharaoh first.
I'm not so sure they're on speaking terms.

941
01:35:13,572 --> 01:35:17,565
As you see, two very fine specimens.

942
01:35:18,410 --> 01:35:20,503
Fine garments. Royal eye tattoos.

943
01:35:20,679 --> 01:35:22,806
Men of station and breeding.

944
01:35:23,248 --> 01:35:27,776
The fat one is...
Well, was, Pharaoh's baker.

945
01:35:27,953 --> 01:35:30,251
The scrawny one, his cupbearer.

946
01:35:30,522 --> 01:35:32,649
Important men.

947
01:35:33,025 --> 01:35:36,483
- How did they end up here?
- Accused of theft.

948
01:35:37,229 --> 01:35:39,697
The Pharaoh's bracelet of the sun.

949
01:35:39,865 --> 01:35:42,356
The mark of the true sun god.

950
01:35:43,235 --> 01:35:45,760
It's gone. Missing.

951
01:35:45,938 --> 01:35:50,102
Pharaoh's seers and prognosticators
say that one of these two is the culprit.

952
01:35:50,776 --> 01:35:53,540
Then their lives are over.

953
01:35:53,712 --> 01:35:55,304
Probably.

954
01:35:55,814 --> 01:35:57,805
But you never know what can happen.

955
01:35:57,983 --> 01:36:01,942
In case they get out of this place
and find themselves restored at court...

956
01:36:02,121 --> 01:36:05,022
... it would serve you well
to serve them well.

957
01:36:06,125 --> 01:36:08,992
- You understand?
- Completely, master.

958
01:36:09,161 --> 01:36:12,790
You do this well, Joseph,
and you can give me a valuable ally...

959
01:36:12,965 --> 01:36:16,662
... when the time comes to plead your case
with Pharaoh himself.

960
01:36:19,304 --> 01:36:21,431
May your god be with you.

961
01:36:38,724 --> 01:36:40,817
I am Joseph, my lords.

962
01:36:40,993 --> 01:36:44,861
I have been instructed to attend you
during your stay here.

963
01:36:45,731 --> 01:36:47,596
Are you the warder?

964
01:36:47,766 --> 01:36:49,961
No, my lord, his servant.

965
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:55,429
You must be the Semite
who does the warder's work for him.

966
01:36:56,175 --> 01:36:58,905
I am honored that you know
of me, my lord.

967
01:36:59,945 --> 01:37:05,884
Yes. The court knows how well
you serve your masters.

968
01:37:06,051 --> 01:37:08,952
And their wives.

969
01:37:10,456 --> 01:37:13,755
There are many stories
that have no truth, my lord.

970
01:37:14,526 --> 01:37:18,485
Are you calling Potiphar a liar, slave?

971
01:37:18,664 --> 01:37:22,600
- No, my lord.
- Are you calling his beautiful wife a liar?

972
01:37:22,768 --> 01:37:24,861
I accuse no one, my lord.

973
01:37:25,037 --> 01:37:27,699
Really? Well...

974
01:37:27,873 --> 01:37:30,341
... I accuse you, slave.

975
01:37:30,642 --> 01:37:34,476
I accuse you of staining
Potiphar's wife's good name...

976
01:37:34,646 --> 01:37:36,739
... of calling Potiphar a liar!

977
01:37:36,915 --> 01:37:39,349
Guard! Guard, come here!

978
01:37:44,056 --> 01:37:45,819
Beat this man with your whip.

979
01:37:46,291 --> 01:37:50,660
Careful, my friend.
We are in his prison.

980
01:37:50,829 --> 01:37:54,287
His prison? He's a slave!

981
01:37:54,633 --> 01:37:58,797
Potiphar will thank me
for punishing such insolence.

982
01:38:00,139 --> 01:38:02,198
Don't look to this slave
for permission.

983
01:38:02,374 --> 01:38:05,775
I serve in the court of the Pharaoh,
god on earth.

984
01:38:06,178 --> 01:38:08,544
Do as I tell you!

985
01:38:14,253 --> 01:38:17,188
You will not slander
the name of Potiphar!

986
01:38:18,423 --> 01:38:23,360
You will not slander
the name of his wife!

987
01:38:23,796 --> 01:38:29,029
He will praise me
for upholding his honor!

988
01:38:29,401 --> 01:38:30,834
Slave!

989
01:38:31,003 --> 01:38:32,732
Slave!

990
01:38:32,905 --> 01:38:34,896
Slave!

991
01:39:20,252 --> 01:39:23,312
They say this season's market
will be bigger than last.

992
01:39:23,488 --> 01:39:26,548
I hope so. It gets harder
to scratch out a living.

993
01:39:26,725 --> 01:39:30,252
Judah, you don't have the animals
to prosper. You know that.

994
01:39:30,429 --> 01:39:33,887
You need good, rutting males,
healthy she-goats, ewes that...

995
01:39:34,066 --> 01:39:38,799
I won't return to my father's camp.
I can't live with Jacob's sorrow.

996
01:39:38,971 --> 01:39:43,271
He still mourns the loss of Joseph,
and the entire settlement is a pool of grief.

997
01:39:43,442 --> 01:39:45,876
As a widower,
I've enough of my own.

998
01:40:00,292 --> 01:40:03,284
I will give your camel water, master.

999
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:09,790
Now, there's a sight.

1000
01:40:11,937 --> 01:40:15,464
A whore. A Canaanite
who hides her face.

1001
01:40:15,641 --> 01:40:17,734
They're always bewitching.

1002
01:40:18,310 --> 01:40:21,768
It's a strange custom,
but it adds to the mystery.

1003
01:40:22,848 --> 01:40:24,406
Traveler...

1004
01:40:24,750 --> 01:40:27,082
... lie with me and ease your mind.

1005
01:40:27,786 --> 01:40:29,481
While lining your pockets.

1006
01:40:29,688 --> 01:40:33,886
Who can put a price on a moment's escape
from the troubles of the world?

1007
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:36,628
I have no money with me.

1008
01:40:36,995 --> 01:40:38,963
My friend is a recent widower...

1009
01:40:39,264 --> 01:40:43,633
... and while he may not have money
with him, he does own fine flocks.

1010
01:40:43,936 --> 01:40:48,464
Perfect animals.
The softest fleece you've ever felt.

1011
01:40:49,207 --> 01:40:53,075
Though I can't say what
someone like you might have felt.

1012
01:40:55,047 --> 01:40:57,379
I see no herds.

1013
01:40:58,717 --> 01:41:00,708
They're at the market.

1014
01:41:02,921 --> 01:41:05,913
I could bring you a sheep
on the way back.

1015
01:41:08,327 --> 01:41:10,056
Tomorrow.

1016
01:41:12,364 --> 01:41:14,264
And until then?

1017
01:41:14,433 --> 01:41:16,162
Only my word.

1018
01:41:16,535 --> 01:41:20,130
Then you can leave me your staff
and seal as a pledge.

1019
01:41:20,305 --> 01:41:22,933
Tomorrow, when you bring the fleece...

1020
01:41:23,308 --> 01:41:25,299
... I'll return them.

1021
01:42:54,099 --> 01:42:56,294
Life is hard on you?

1022
01:42:57,536 --> 01:43:01,905
A barren daughter-in-law
that buried my first son.

1023
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:04,174
People die.

1024
01:43:05,077 --> 01:43:06,704
They do.

1025
01:43:07,512 --> 01:43:11,448
But as is the custom with my people,
I forced my second son to marry her...

1026
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:14,585
... so that his brother's wealth
would not be lost.

1027
01:43:15,287 --> 01:43:17,380
And he, too, died.

1028
01:43:17,956 --> 01:43:20,322
Misfortune indeed.

1029
01:43:20,492 --> 01:43:22,619
You have other family?

1030
01:43:23,061 --> 01:43:25,291
Eleven brothers.

1031
01:43:26,798 --> 01:43:28,925
Once there were 12...

1032
01:43:30,368 --> 01:43:35,635
... but the second youngest
was taken by a wild animal.

1033
01:43:36,374 --> 01:43:38,001
Ever since, not a day passes...

1034
01:43:38,176 --> 01:43:41,737
... but my father sheds a tear
at the youngster's memory.

1035
01:43:42,647 --> 01:43:47,346
His sorrow was so thick I had to leave
and start my own encampment.

1036
01:43:47,752 --> 01:43:51,017
You grieve as if the boy's death
was your fault.

1037
01:43:51,189 --> 01:43:54,283
Never! In no way!

1038
01:43:54,893 --> 01:43:57,225
Why would you even think
such a thing?

1039
01:43:57,395 --> 01:43:59,488
No injury intended.

1040
01:44:04,636 --> 01:44:06,900
You're a very fine woman.

1041
01:44:08,607 --> 01:44:10,131
Thank you.

1042
01:44:11,643 --> 01:44:13,838
Until tomorrow, then...

1043
01:44:14,446 --> 01:44:16,710
... when I bring you your fleece...

1044
01:44:16,882 --> 01:44:19,544
... and redeem my staff and seal.

1045
01:44:24,089 --> 01:44:25,989
Until tomorrow.

1046
01:44:33,398 --> 01:44:37,596
Pay homage to Potiphar,
chief steward to...

1047
01:44:37,769 --> 01:44:39,498
Peace be upon you, master.

1048
01:44:39,671 --> 01:44:42,435
Guard the door, Ednan. The door.

1049
01:44:42,874 --> 01:44:44,398
Come.

1050
01:44:46,211 --> 01:44:48,771
The warder says your guests
aren't sleeping well.

1051
01:44:48,947 --> 01:44:51,313
It seems their sleep's
troubled by dreams?

1052
01:44:52,083 --> 01:44:53,573
They're not alone.

1053
01:44:53,919 --> 01:44:55,978
Strange dreams.

1054
01:44:56,655 --> 01:44:58,646
Full of signs.

1055
01:44:59,391 --> 01:45:02,189
As soon as I learned of this,
I came myself...

1056
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:06,262
... because I know of your gift
for reading the messages of the night.

1057
01:45:06,831 --> 01:45:09,766
Redeem yourself
by interpreting for them.

1058
01:45:10,335 --> 01:45:14,863
You can't remain silent now that
they know you have this special gift.

1059
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:16,605
How do they know?

1060
01:45:17,242 --> 01:45:19,233
I'm due back at court.

1061
01:45:19,411 --> 01:45:23,438
Pharaoh's men work night and day
to retrieve the bracelet.

1062
01:45:23,615 --> 01:45:25,776
They'll have it before long.

1063
01:45:45,136 --> 01:45:48,469
I hear you have the gift
of second sight.

1064
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:51,905
At times, master,
when God sees fit to grant it.

1065
01:45:52,077 --> 01:45:56,013
How low have we fallen?
Listening to the ramblings of a Semite slave.

1066
01:45:56,181 --> 01:45:59,412
The ability to interpret dreams
is a gift from God.

1067
01:45:59,584 --> 01:46:03,111
Then why don't you see how well
he can do for you, vintner.

1068
01:46:03,288 --> 01:46:05,552
I intend to.

1069
01:46:05,724 --> 01:46:08,352
Be seated, Joseph.

1070
01:46:14,065 --> 01:46:16,158
Here is my dream.

1071
01:46:16,635 --> 01:46:19,433
I was in a vineyard
in the countryside.

1072
01:46:19,604 --> 01:46:24,337
There was a vine in front of me,
and on the vine were three branches...

1073
01:46:24,509 --> 01:46:26,807
... one of which began to bud.

1074
01:46:26,978 --> 01:46:30,505
Now, no sooner had it budded
than it blossomed...

1075
01:46:30,682 --> 01:46:34,743
... and its clusters became rich grapes.

1076
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:38,551
I had Pharaoh's cup in my hand.

1077
01:46:38,723 --> 01:46:44,252
I picked the grapes and I squeezed them
into Pharaoh's cup.

1078
01:46:44,429 --> 01:46:48,160
And then I handed the cup to Pharaoh.

1079
01:46:49,067 --> 01:46:51,934
Now, can you interpret?

1080
01:46:56,308 --> 01:46:58,799
This is what it means.

1081
01:46:59,911 --> 01:47:02,709
The three branches are three days.

1082
01:47:03,148 --> 01:47:06,481
In another three days,
the Pharaoh will lift up your head...

1083
01:47:06,651 --> 01:47:09,313
... and restore you to your position.

1084
01:47:09,487 --> 01:47:13,389
Then you will hand the Pharaoh his cup,
as you have always done.

1085
01:47:14,225 --> 01:47:16,693
Rest easy. Your days here are numbered.

1086
01:47:16,861 --> 01:47:19,261
Can it be true?

1087
01:47:20,332 --> 01:47:22,493
Now listen to me, slave.

1088
01:47:22,667 --> 01:47:24,999
I, too, had a dream.

1089
01:47:25,937 --> 01:47:29,668
There were three wicker trays
on my head.

1090
01:47:29,841 --> 01:47:34,210
In the top tray were all kinds
of pastries for Pharaoh...

1091
01:47:34,379 --> 01:47:36,813
... such as a baker might make.

1092
01:47:36,981 --> 01:47:42,613
But birds were eating them
off the tray on my head.

1093
01:47:42,787 --> 01:47:44,448
Give me its meaning.

1094
01:47:46,024 --> 01:47:49,858
I am sorry.
I cannot interpret that dream.

1095
01:47:50,028 --> 01:47:51,928
You can.

1096
01:47:52,564 --> 01:47:54,896
I know you can.

1097
01:47:55,233 --> 01:47:57,394
You're hiding something from me.

1098
01:47:57,836 --> 01:48:00,100
Tell me what it means.

1099
01:48:00,672 --> 01:48:02,401
Very well.

1100
01:48:02,941 --> 01:48:05,967
This is what I believe
your dream to mean.

1101
01:48:06,978 --> 01:48:09,776
The three trays are also three days.

1102
01:48:10,115 --> 01:48:14,108
In another three days, the Pharaoh
will lift up your head as well...

1103
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:17,281
... by hanging you from a gallows.

1104
01:48:17,455 --> 01:48:21,152
Then the birds will eat the flesh
from your bones.

1105
01:48:28,333 --> 01:48:31,131
The Pharaoh's bracelet has been found.

1106
01:48:32,637 --> 01:48:34,832
Warrants have been issued.

1107
01:48:35,006 --> 01:48:37,031
What does it say?

1108
01:48:40,412 --> 01:48:42,778
She promised she'd be here!

1109
01:48:42,947 --> 01:48:47,441
More to your good fortune she's not.
You kept your end of the bargain.

1110
01:48:47,619 --> 01:48:52,556
If she's not here, you get the sweet memory
of her bed and get to keep your animals.

1111
01:48:52,724 --> 01:48:56,888
I gave her my staff and seal
as a pledge, remember?

1112
01:48:58,430 --> 01:49:01,797
Come. I think I can find her home.

1113
01:49:24,556 --> 01:49:27,457
My punishment will never end.

1114
01:49:28,026 --> 01:49:29,391
Never.

1115
01:49:53,084 --> 01:49:56,781
I am most grateful for your judgment
in this matter.

1116
01:49:56,955 --> 01:50:00,186
I always knew, even in the darkest days,
that I could always...

1117
01:50:00,358 --> 01:50:01,382
Yes?

1118
01:50:02,260 --> 01:50:06,754
I trust my master's stay here
was made as easy as possible.

1119
01:50:06,931 --> 01:50:09,399
Yes, yes.

1120
01:50:09,567 --> 01:50:12,764
Considering the circumstances.

1121
01:50:30,622 --> 01:50:33,682
Now, repeat everything
you've learned, Benjamin.

1122
01:50:34,859 --> 01:50:37,384
The table of the descendants of Terah...

1123
01:50:37,562 --> 01:50:41,658
... who was 70 when he begat
Abram, Nahor and Haran...

1124
01:50:41,833 --> 01:50:44,529
You know I have the lines
of our family memorized.

1125
01:50:44,702 --> 01:50:47,068
Shouldn't I help my brothers
pen the flocks?

1126
01:50:47,238 --> 01:50:49,706
Their backs are strong enough
for the job.

1127
01:50:49,874 --> 01:50:53,401
For you, this is more important.
You have to carry on the line.

1128
01:50:53,578 --> 01:50:56,843
But I'm the youngest, Father.
Reuben, even Judah...

1129
01:50:57,015 --> 01:51:01,179
Could spend a lifetime showing me
they're not up to the task.

1130
01:51:01,753 --> 01:51:05,849
It would have been Joseph
who would've carried on the line...

1131
01:51:06,424 --> 01:51:08,051
... but my other sons...

1132
01:51:09,561 --> 01:51:12,962
It was a wild animal who took Joseph.

1133
01:51:13,231 --> 01:51:15,825
You can't go on blaming
the others forever.

1134
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,366
We must take our signs from God.

1135
01:51:18,536 --> 01:51:22,870
In my heart, I know Rachel was called
to give us the next in line.

1136
01:51:23,041 --> 01:51:29,139
And with Joseph gone, that means
you must keep our traditions alive.

1137
01:51:29,414 --> 01:51:33,783
Maintain Abraham's covenant
with our Lord, blessed be his name.

1138
01:51:34,819 --> 01:51:37,754
Now, young man, back to the tables.

1139
01:51:40,491 --> 01:51:43,858
And the sons of Abraham
were Isaac and Ishmael.

1140
01:51:44,028 --> 01:51:47,259
And Isaac begat Esau and Jacob.

1141
01:51:47,432 --> 01:51:51,835
- Esau, who was called Edom, took wives...
- Father! Father!

1142
01:51:52,003 --> 01:51:54,631
Father. Quickly. It's Judah.

1143
01:51:56,941 --> 01:51:58,772
Judah?

1144
01:52:05,717 --> 01:52:07,810
Look, it's Judah!

1145
01:52:07,986 --> 01:52:10,648
Judah has returned!

1146
01:52:15,226 --> 01:52:17,694
Judah has returned!

1147
01:52:23,836 --> 01:52:25,736
Judah!

1148
01:52:27,406 --> 01:52:30,898
He's returned after all these years, Judah!

1149
01:52:33,812 --> 01:52:36,679
- Reuben.
- Judah.

1150
01:52:38,517 --> 01:52:40,280
Simeon.

1151
01:52:43,255 --> 01:52:44,847
Levi.

1152
01:52:46,291 --> 01:52:48,259
Dan!

1153
01:52:49,895 --> 01:52:52,386
Naphtali, Naphtali.

1154
01:52:52,998 --> 01:52:54,693
Gad.

1155
01:52:56,769 --> 01:52:58,794
Asher.

1156
01:53:00,506 --> 01:53:03,134
- Issacar.
- Hey, Judah.

1157
01:53:03,709 --> 01:53:05,506
Zebulon.

1158
01:53:06,412 --> 01:53:10,075
And little Benjamin.
Though not so little anymore.

1159
01:53:14,186 --> 01:53:16,177
And my father.

1160
01:53:17,289 --> 01:53:19,519
My father, Jacob.

1161
01:53:27,332 --> 01:53:31,234
Welcome to my... Our camp.

1162
01:53:31,804 --> 01:53:34,102
To you and yours...

1163
01:53:35,207 --> 01:53:37,573
... though I am surprised to see you.

1164
01:53:38,310 --> 01:53:41,143
I couldn't stay away from you, Father.

1165
01:53:41,313 --> 01:53:42,940
Especially now...

1166
01:53:43,115 --> 01:53:46,642
... when my clan faces a problem
that needs a wiser head than mine.

1167
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:49,751
What sort of problem?

1168
01:53:50,823 --> 01:53:54,987
Tamar, widow of two of my sons...

1169
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:58,823
... and betrothed to Selah, my third,
is with child.

1170
01:53:59,565 --> 01:54:01,931
And Selah is the father?

1171
01:54:02,101 --> 01:54:06,970
No. And she refuses to say
who she laid with.

1172
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:12,271
And no matter how hard we press her...

1173
01:54:12,878 --> 01:54:14,743
... she stays silent.

1174
01:54:14,913 --> 01:54:17,279
Then, by custom, she must be banished.

1175
01:54:18,217 --> 01:54:20,082
But by Canaanite way...

1176
01:54:20,252 --> 01:54:24,188
... when a woman lies with a man
other than her betrothed...

1177
01:54:24,723 --> 01:54:26,054
... she must die.

1178
01:54:28,727 --> 01:54:30,695
What should I have done, Father?

1179
01:54:30,863 --> 01:54:34,890
I gave her my first-born in marriage,
and he died childless.

1180
01:54:35,067 --> 01:54:39,128
So I insisted my second son marry her,
as his duty to the family.

1181
01:54:39,304 --> 01:54:41,204
Still she remained barren.

1182
01:54:41,373 --> 01:54:43,432
Then when he died...

1183
01:54:44,676 --> 01:54:48,237
You promised your son Selah,
as is our custom.

1184
01:54:48,747 --> 01:54:50,977
But I kept delaying the marriage.

1185
01:54:51,150 --> 01:54:52,811
The woman's cursed, Father.

1186
01:54:52,985 --> 01:54:56,284
She buries husbands before
there are sons to replace them.

1187
01:54:56,455 --> 01:54:59,913
I lost two boys I loved.

1188
01:55:00,092 --> 01:55:02,287
Should I have risked a third?

1189
01:55:02,828 --> 01:55:06,628
I know the pain of losing a child
you love dearly.

1190
01:55:07,833 --> 01:55:09,698
I know it well.

1191
01:55:15,707 --> 01:55:18,005
- Yes?
- She'll speak of anything you ask...

1192
01:55:18,177 --> 01:55:20,702
... except the father of the child
in her stomach.

1193
01:55:20,879 --> 01:55:24,576
- And she's unafraid.
- This is not our problem, Jacob.

1194
01:55:25,717 --> 01:55:27,981
That much is true, Judah.

1195
01:55:28,754 --> 01:55:30,847
You left this camp...

1196
01:55:31,023 --> 01:55:33,514
... and established your own line.

1197
01:55:34,092 --> 01:55:38,620
You must be responsible for yourself
and the decisions you made.

1198
01:55:45,003 --> 01:55:47,563
We'll take her back to our camp.

1199
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:51,737
There, by Canaanite custom...

1200
01:55:52,377 --> 01:55:53,605
... she must die.

1201
01:56:00,619 --> 01:56:02,780
We leave at first light.

1202
01:56:04,089 --> 01:56:05,317
Fine-looking flock.

1203
01:56:05,490 --> 01:56:09,119
Well, there is rumor there's some
outbreak of fever among...

1204
01:56:33,986 --> 01:56:35,647
So, what do you have? A knife?

1205
01:56:35,821 --> 01:56:38,984
You think that by killing me
you can save your own life?

1206
01:56:39,625 --> 01:56:42,423
You do me a favor, whore!

1207
01:56:42,594 --> 01:56:47,293
By trying to spill my blood, you justify
my own decision to see you executed.

1208
01:57:05,117 --> 01:57:06,812
You?

1209
01:57:07,352 --> 01:57:11,379
I only did it because I wanted a child.
This child that is rightfully mine.

1210
01:57:11,556 --> 01:57:14,320
A son to continue
the name of my husband Er...

1211
01:57:14,493 --> 01:57:17,087
... your own son and first-born.

1212
01:57:17,829 --> 01:57:22,698
But you didn't give Selah to me when he
came of age, as you should have done.

1213
01:57:23,936 --> 01:57:27,201
You're a very courageous girl, Tamar.

1214
01:57:28,507 --> 01:57:31,806
But not brave enough to face death.

1215
01:57:32,110 --> 01:57:34,169
That won't happen.

1216
01:57:34,546 --> 01:57:36,844
I have enough to answer for.

1217
01:57:37,015 --> 01:57:41,850
The crime of taking your life for something
I have done is more than I can bear.

1218
01:57:43,722 --> 01:57:46,316
You were right and I was wrong.

1219
01:57:46,491 --> 01:57:49,085
I should have given you to Selah.

1220
01:57:49,261 --> 01:57:51,991
The only sin there is belongs to me.

1221
01:57:52,631 --> 01:57:55,828
You will live to have your child...

1222
01:57:56,001 --> 01:57:58,060
... and raise him as a mother should...

1223
01:57:59,504 --> 01:58:02,132
... living in your own tent...

1224
01:58:02,307 --> 01:58:04,366
... with respect...

1225
01:58:05,077 --> 01:58:06,908
... and love.

1226
01:58:45,917 --> 01:58:48,579
Pay heed as the god Ra
walks among you.

1227
01:58:48,820 --> 01:58:52,984
Pay heed to the Pharaoh,
sun of the heavens...

1228
01:58:53,158 --> 01:58:55,854
... Ra incarnate.

1229
01:59:26,792 --> 01:59:30,660
- The Pharaoh is Ra.
- Ra is the Pharaoh.

1230
01:59:30,996 --> 01:59:34,363
As the god Ra fills
the heavens with the sun...

1231
01:59:34,533 --> 01:59:39,334
... so the Pharaoh Ra on earth
does the same here below.

1232
01:59:39,905 --> 01:59:43,306
Potiphar, the gods must be blinding you.

1233
01:59:43,475 --> 01:59:45,807
A fool can see I shed no light.

1234
01:59:45,977 --> 01:59:49,504
The Pharaoh is not well.
Physician, attend the god on earth!

1235
01:59:49,681 --> 01:59:52,206
It's not my body that ails!

1236
01:59:53,485 --> 01:59:55,214
If you knew your signs, vizier...

1237
01:59:55,387 --> 01:59:58,254
... you'd see it's my heart
that weighs me down.

1238
01:59:58,423 --> 02:00:00,823
I'm beginning to wonder
if you know your art.

1239
02:00:01,593 --> 02:00:05,029
If the Pharaoh is in pain,
then let him speak of it...

1240
02:00:05,197 --> 02:00:07,563
... and the answer will be his.

1241
02:00:09,401 --> 02:00:13,360
Dreams. I am haunted by dreams.

1242
02:00:13,805 --> 02:00:15,773
I dreamt...

1243
02:00:17,375 --> 02:00:19,866
I dreamt I was in the great river...

1244
02:00:20,045 --> 02:00:23,310
... communing with my spirit
in the heavens.

1245
02:00:24,282 --> 02:00:27,012
Near me were seven...

1246
02:00:27,185 --> 02:00:31,554
... wonderfully fat
and gentle water cows...

1247
02:00:31,723 --> 02:00:35,056
... who seemed to float along with me.

1248
02:00:35,227 --> 02:00:36,956
It was serene.

1249
02:00:37,129 --> 02:00:39,495
So very serene.

1250
02:00:40,599 --> 02:00:42,396
But we were not alone.

1251
02:00:42,567 --> 02:00:47,095
Horrible, starving cows
suddenly appeared...

1252
02:00:47,272 --> 02:00:52,437
... and the thin, wretched cows
ate the sleek, fat cows.

1253
02:00:53,211 --> 02:00:55,236
I woke in a cold sweat...

1254
02:00:55,947 --> 02:00:58,438
... and, to my horror...

1255
02:00:58,617 --> 02:01:02,485
... when I finally got back to sleep,
I had a second dream...

1256
02:01:02,654 --> 02:01:04,554
... just as frightening.

1257
02:01:05,157 --> 02:01:06,624
In this dream...

1258
02:01:06,791 --> 02:01:10,784
... there were seven plump ears of corn...

1259
02:01:10,962 --> 02:01:13,294
... growing on a stalk.

1260
02:01:13,632 --> 02:01:17,796
Then seven blighted ears...

1261
02:01:17,969 --> 02:01:21,632
... meager and scorched
by the east wind...

1262
02:01:21,806 --> 02:01:25,765
... sprouted teeth
and devoured the good ears.

1263
02:01:25,944 --> 02:01:30,108
What can these dreams possibly mean?
They can't be a good sign.

1264
02:01:30,282 --> 02:01:32,477
Let us begin.

1265
02:01:54,339 --> 02:01:56,239
A cup of wine.

1266
02:02:27,272 --> 02:02:32,369
Majesty, as might be expected
from the messages to god...

1267
02:02:32,544 --> 02:02:35,274
... there is a balance
in these holy dreams.

1268
02:02:35,447 --> 02:02:38,075
First, the sacred, life-giving Nile...

1269
02:02:38,250 --> 02:02:41,811
... and then the divine presence
of the omnipotent Pharaoh himself.

1270
02:02:41,987 --> 02:02:44,421
The healthy cows
and then the lean cows.

1271
02:02:44,589 --> 02:02:47,456
The ripe ears and then the unripe ears.

1272
02:02:47,626 --> 02:02:51,528
I know what was in the dreams.
I had them!

1273
02:02:51,696 --> 02:02:53,960
Your job is to tell me what they mean.

1274
02:02:54,132 --> 02:02:57,693
We do not know, Majesty.

1275
02:03:04,843 --> 02:03:06,435
How can you remain silent...

1276
02:03:06,611 --> 02:03:09,671
... when you know of a man
who can ease your Pharaoh's mind?

1277
02:03:09,848 --> 02:03:13,113
I dare not, master.
The Pharaoh's mood is black.

1278
02:03:13,285 --> 02:03:15,810
I dare not remind him
that I was in his disfavor.

1279
02:03:15,987 --> 02:03:18,956
Come on, man. Don't be a fool.

1280
02:03:19,124 --> 02:03:22,150
But I am a humble wine-bearer, master.

1281
02:03:22,327 --> 02:03:25,262
It is for you, Potiphar,
the chief steward.

1282
02:03:25,430 --> 02:03:28,160
It is for you to speak up.

1283
02:03:28,333 --> 02:03:30,164
More wine!

1284
02:03:36,841 --> 02:03:40,277
May I speak with you, Pharaoh?

1285
02:03:40,445 --> 02:03:43,710
Only so others may not hear.

1286
02:03:53,758 --> 02:03:56,693
You'd have the dreams
of your Pharaoh...

1287
02:03:56,861 --> 02:03:59,421
... interpreted by an alien slave?

1288
02:03:59,597 --> 02:04:02,293
Sire? The Semite slave...

1289
02:04:02,467 --> 02:04:06,528
... interpreted both this man's dreams
and that of the baker.

1290
02:04:06,705 --> 02:04:09,833
He saw the Pharaoh's hand
in our dreams...

1291
02:04:10,008 --> 02:04:12,636
... and predicted
his judgments accurately.

1292
02:04:18,817 --> 02:04:22,617
Well, this slave of yours,
how is he called?

1293
02:04:23,321 --> 02:04:24,913
Joseph, sire.

1294
02:04:25,957 --> 02:04:30,018
Bring me Joseph the Semite
from the dungeon...

1295
02:04:30,195 --> 02:04:32,663
... and tell him nothing about my dreams.

1296
02:04:43,475 --> 02:04:45,500
What is this?

1297
02:04:46,378 --> 02:04:48,972
I order you, speak!

1298
02:04:49,347 --> 02:04:51,645
What are you doing?

1299
02:04:51,816 --> 02:04:53,545
Please.

1300
02:04:54,552 --> 02:04:56,611
What have I done?

1301
02:05:21,246 --> 02:05:22,873
Lie prostrate, quick.

1302
02:05:24,315 --> 02:05:26,442
I cannot. You know that.

1303
02:05:26,618 --> 02:05:28,313
You what?

1304
02:05:29,587 --> 02:05:32,818
Truly, the Pharaoh is greatness itself...

1305
02:05:32,991 --> 02:05:37,758
... but, sire, my faith decrees
I can kneel only before God himself.

1306
02:05:37,929 --> 02:05:40,397
Even on pain of death.

1307
02:05:45,003 --> 02:05:46,937
Come forward.

1308
02:05:49,641 --> 02:05:51,074
Take heed, magicians.

1309
02:05:51,242 --> 02:05:56,077
Whatever else, I know this man
won't lie to me to save his life.

1310
02:06:01,419 --> 02:06:02,750
Look upon my face.

1311
02:06:07,058 --> 02:06:10,186
But surely, great Pharaoh,
this is forbidden.

1312
02:06:10,728 --> 02:06:13,322
Only to people who know our god.

1313
02:06:13,498 --> 02:06:17,229
Since you hold some primitive being
in higher regard...

1314
02:06:17,402 --> 02:06:20,894
... I expect that you can look upon me
without burning up.

1315
02:06:21,206 --> 02:06:22,935
Try it.

1316
02:06:32,884 --> 02:06:36,615
I'm told you've learned the secret
of reading messages of the night.

1317
02:06:36,988 --> 02:06:41,618
Interpreting dreams is not a thing to be
learned, Pharaoh. It is a gift from God.

1318
02:06:41,793 --> 02:06:45,388
Careful! One mention
too many of this god...

1319
02:06:45,563 --> 02:06:49,090
... and you'll be at his side
with your head under your arm.

1320
02:06:49,267 --> 02:06:53,260
So you've been given this gift?

1321
02:06:53,571 --> 02:06:56,438
I imagine we shall soon see, Pharaoh.

1322
02:06:57,375 --> 02:06:59,275
Your life...

1323
02:06:59,911 --> 02:07:03,244
... depends upon what we shall see.

1324
02:07:04,115 --> 02:07:06,481
Now, listen carefully.

1325
02:07:06,985 --> 02:07:09,044
In my dream...

1326
02:07:10,388 --> 02:07:14,085
... there were seven cows,
fat and sleek...

1327
02:07:14,259 --> 02:07:15,988
... and they grazed peacefully...

1328
02:07:16,160 --> 02:07:18,151
He's a very beautiful boy.

1329
02:07:18,329 --> 02:07:20,729
Yes, he is.

1330
02:07:20,899 --> 02:07:23,060
Do you know what his crime was?

1331
02:07:23,234 --> 02:07:26,863
I've heard the rumors,
but I don't believe it.

1332
02:07:27,038 --> 02:07:29,563
He doesn't strike me as a fool...

1333
02:07:29,741 --> 02:07:34,144
... and everyone knows
that Potiphar's wife deceives him.

1334
02:07:34,746 --> 02:07:38,238
I've never seen such poor cows
in all of Egypt.

1335
02:07:38,416 --> 02:07:41,544
But it was impossible to tell
they had eaten the fat cows...

1336
02:07:41,719 --> 02:07:44,950
... for they looked as wretched as ever.

1337
02:07:45,757 --> 02:07:48,225
Was there a second dream?

1338
02:07:50,061 --> 02:07:52,621
We have told him nothing, sire.

1339
02:07:53,831 --> 02:07:55,298
Yes.

1340
02:07:56,434 --> 02:07:57,867
In the second dream...

1341
02:07:58,036 --> 02:08:01,938
... there were seven ears of grain,
beautifully ripe.

1342
02:08:02,240 --> 02:08:04,367
Then, sprouting up behind them...

1343
02:08:04,542 --> 02:08:09,673
... were seven withered ears of grain
which devoured the ripe ones.

1344
02:08:19,891 --> 02:08:23,054
God has revealed to Pharaoh
what he intends to do.

1345
02:08:23,494 --> 02:08:26,952
- Yes?
- Pharaoh's dreams are one and the same.

1346
02:08:27,565 --> 02:08:30,466
The seven fine cows
and seven ripe ears of grain...

1347
02:08:30,635 --> 02:08:33,126
... represent seven years of plenty.

1348
02:08:33,304 --> 02:08:36,740
The seven wretched cows
and seven shriveled ears of grain...

1349
02:08:36,908 --> 02:08:39,672
... are years of great want.

1350
02:08:40,845 --> 02:08:44,303
There will be seven years
of famine, my lord.

1351
02:08:45,883 --> 02:08:47,783
Madness.

1352
02:08:49,921 --> 02:08:51,889
Madness!

1353
02:08:52,056 --> 02:08:55,992
As if my brother, the sun,
and sister, the moon...

1354
02:08:56,160 --> 02:08:59,652
... would send me messages
only a slave could read!

1355
02:08:59,831 --> 02:09:02,095
Potiphar, take him from my sight!

1356
02:09:02,266 --> 02:09:04,860
Get him back to his dungeon
and keep him there...

1357
02:09:05,036 --> 02:09:07,664
... until I decide how best
to deal with him.

1358
02:09:27,925 --> 02:09:29,654
No!

1359
02:09:29,827 --> 02:09:31,658
No!

1360
02:09:36,567 --> 02:09:38,262
No!

1361
02:09:44,842 --> 02:09:49,438
Husband, another dream
to ruin all our sleep?

1362
02:09:50,848 --> 02:09:53,908
No, the same one.

1363
02:09:54,352 --> 02:09:57,446
This is too important to ignore.

1364
02:09:57,789 --> 02:10:00,053
I'm lost, wife.

1365
02:10:01,726 --> 02:10:04,024
- Help me.
- Me?

1366
02:10:04,195 --> 02:10:06,026
And risk your anger?

1367
02:10:06,197 --> 02:10:09,928
No, I'll keep my own counsel, my lord.

1368
02:10:12,203 --> 02:10:15,798
Asenath here, on the other hand...

1369
02:10:16,107 --> 02:10:18,098
Yes.

1370
02:10:20,845 --> 02:10:23,245
Let me guess.

1371
02:10:24,148 --> 02:10:28,949
She's so taken with this foreign slave.
Oh, yes.

1372
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:32,749
Nothing escapes Pharaoh's eye,
young woman <i>:

1373
02:10:42,366 --> 02:10:44,698
She thinks he has the answer.

1374
02:10:49,073 --> 02:10:54,101
By your own word, lord, we know
he does nothing against his conscience...

1375
02:10:54,278 --> 02:10:56,075
... even on pain of death.

1376
02:10:57,148 --> 02:11:00,777
And you yourself
seem reluctant to see him hanged.

1377
02:11:02,153 --> 02:11:05,520
There must be a reason
you held your mighty hand...

1378
02:11:05,690 --> 02:11:08,625
... spared him to live to see another day.

1379
02:11:22,940 --> 02:11:26,899
I've thought long and hard
of your reading of my messages.

1380
02:11:27,078 --> 02:11:28,477
Have you?

1381
02:11:28,679 --> 02:11:31,375
- Yes, master.
- And?

1382
02:11:31,549 --> 02:11:35,645
I am certain that Pharaoh has been blessed
by a warning from the Lord himself.

1383
02:11:38,189 --> 02:11:42,785
So assume, then, that
your reading is accurate.

1384
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:46,987
Is there nothing we can do
to prevent this disaster?

1385
02:11:47,999 --> 02:11:50,126
Yes, master, there is.

1386
02:11:51,068 --> 02:11:52,433
How?

1387
02:11:52,603 --> 02:11:57,370
Pharaoh must select a wise and honest man
and set him above the land of Egypt.

1388
02:11:57,542 --> 02:11:59,601
He must see that Pharaoh's overseers...

1389
02:11:59,777 --> 02:12:03,338
... collect a fifth of what is produced
during the years of plenty...

1390
02:12:03,514 --> 02:12:06,176
... and store it for use
during the years of famine.

1391
02:12:06,350 --> 02:12:09,285
In that way, Egypt will not be destroyed
by the drought.

1392
02:12:09,453 --> 02:12:13,082
Impossible. Storing seven years of grain.

1393
02:12:13,257 --> 02:12:14,815
It's impossible.

1394
02:12:15,526 --> 02:12:18,927
Is there no other way to avert disaster?

1395
02:12:19,097 --> 02:12:20,860
No, master.

1396
02:12:21,266 --> 02:12:24,599
Nothing like this
has ever been attempted.

1397
02:12:24,770 --> 02:12:28,433
So a fifth of all the harvest...

1398
02:12:28,607 --> 02:12:30,507
... would be entrusted to Pharaoh.

1399
02:12:31,009 --> 02:12:35,207
Yes, master. All Egypt would be required
to pay you this tribute.

1400
02:12:37,783 --> 02:12:43,221
It would call for a man
of exceptional talent.

1401
02:12:47,459 --> 02:12:50,656
That excludes each of you!

1402
02:12:57,202 --> 02:13:00,899
Potiphar, perhaps.

1403
02:13:07,546 --> 02:13:09,309
The answer is obvious.

1404
02:13:09,982 --> 02:13:13,509
There could be no better man
for this job...

1405
02:13:14,319 --> 02:13:16,446
... than this man himself.

1406
02:13:23,996 --> 02:13:29,593
Can we find anyone endowed
with the spirit of god as he is?

1407
02:13:32,671 --> 02:13:35,640
I think not.

1408
02:13:35,841 --> 02:13:37,968
Well said, wife.

1409
02:13:38,710 --> 02:13:44,580
Now, hear the word of Pharaoh,
Ra on earth, god as man:

1410
02:13:45,350 --> 02:13:48,251
You shall be my chancellor.

1411
02:13:50,756 --> 02:13:55,193
And all my people
shall respect your orders.

1412
02:13:55,928 --> 02:14:00,194
Only this throne shall set me above you.

1413
02:14:03,535 --> 02:14:08,632
I make you the governor
of all of Egypt.

1414
02:14:09,408 --> 02:14:11,808
I set you over my house...

1415
02:14:12,611 --> 02:14:16,707
... my people, my entire kingdom.

1416
02:14:16,882 --> 02:14:21,581
Without your consent,
no man shall lift up hand or foot...

1417
02:14:21,753 --> 02:14:23,186
... in all of Egypt.

1418
02:14:23,789 --> 02:14:26,280
Your name shall be...

1419
02:14:28,794 --> 02:14:31,490
... Zaphenath-paneah.

1420
02:14:38,704 --> 02:14:42,640
And this fine woman
shall be your wife.

1421
02:14:56,021 --> 02:14:57,921
The Pharaoh is Ra.

1422
02:14:58,090 --> 02:15:00,558
He sees into the depths of every being.

1423
02:15:01,059 --> 02:15:03,289
God has seen and spoken.

1424
02:15:03,462 --> 02:15:07,558
<i>Pharaoh is Ra. </i>
<i>Pharaoh is Ra. </i>

1425
02:15:07,733 --> 02:15:10,031
<i>Pharaoh is Ra. </i>

1426
02:15:10,302 --> 02:15:16,366
This time your god's blessing
makes you master, even of me.

1427
02:15:16,541 --> 02:15:20,443
<i>Pharaoh is Ra. </i>
<i>Pharaoh is Ra. </i>

1428
02:15:20,612 --> 02:15:23,376
I trust you'll treat me kindly.

1429
02:15:44,236 --> 02:15:47,000
- What is your name?
- Asenath.

1430
02:15:47,172 --> 02:15:49,970
I'm the daughter
of the high priest of On.

1431
02:15:50,142 --> 02:15:53,543
Excuse me, but what is my new name?
I have forgotten it.

1432
02:15:53,712 --> 02:15:55,942
Zaphenath-paneah.

1433
02:15:56,114 --> 02:15:59,106
Zaphenath-paneah. What does it mean?

1434
02:15:59,284 --> 02:16:01,218
"The savior. "

1435
02:16:01,386 --> 02:16:03,217
- The savior.
- Am I pleasing to you?

1436
02:16:03,388 --> 02:16:05,618
Yes. Yes.

1437
02:16:06,258 --> 02:16:07,885
Greatly.

1438
02:16:33,452 --> 02:16:35,579
I present to you...

1439
02:16:35,754 --> 02:16:37,278
... Zaphenath-paneah.

1440
02:16:37,456 --> 02:16:39,117
<i>Zaphenath-paneah!</i>

1441
02:16:45,630 --> 02:16:47,825
If you will permit me, Joseph...

1442
02:16:47,999 --> 02:16:51,093
I'm sorry. Zaphenath-paneah.

1443
02:16:51,269 --> 02:16:54,830
In this great task,
you'll need someone at your side...

1444
02:16:55,006 --> 02:16:57,065
... as you were once at mine.

1445
02:17:01,780 --> 02:17:06,012
To serve thee, master,
would be a high honor...

1446
02:17:06,885 --> 02:17:09,547
... but my sins against you are many.

1447
02:17:10,388 --> 02:17:12,185
On your feet, Ednan.

1448
02:17:15,627 --> 02:17:18,892
Forgiveness is greater than vengeance...

1449
02:17:19,831 --> 02:17:22,197
... compassion more powerful than anger.

1450
02:17:24,369 --> 02:17:26,530
As I myself have learned.

1451
02:17:31,042 --> 02:17:33,101
May your god watch over you.

1452
02:17:33,945 --> 02:17:35,674
Like all Egypt...

1453
02:17:36,214 --> 02:17:38,478
... my life depends on it.

1454
02:17:40,418 --> 02:17:42,147
Go now.

1455
02:17:45,157 --> 02:17:46,681
Go.

1456
02:17:50,729 --> 02:17:53,857
<i>Zaphenath-paneah!</i>
<i>Zaphenath-paneah!</i>

1457
02:18:56,828 --> 02:18:59,126
Make way!

1458
02:18:59,297 --> 02:19:01,322
Make way there!

1459
02:19:01,499 --> 02:19:03,160
Make way!

1460
02:19:34,232 --> 02:19:35,995
My son.

1461
02:19:40,538 --> 02:19:44,804
How fortunate a child
to have so beautiful a mother.

1462
02:19:49,581 --> 02:19:52,243
Have you decided
on a name for your son?

1463
02:19:52,751 --> 02:19:55,481
He shall be called Manasseh...

1464
02:19:56,087 --> 02:19:59,614
... which in my tongue means
"causing to forget. "

1465
02:20:00,692 --> 02:20:04,059
And God has made me
forget my hardship.

1466
02:20:05,063 --> 02:20:09,124
I doubt that you've forgotten
the house of your father, Joseph.

1467
02:20:11,536 --> 02:20:13,697
Jacob would be pleased
to learn his son...

1468
02:20:13,872 --> 02:20:17,706
... has become the second-most
powerful man in the world.

1469
02:20:18,543 --> 02:20:22,001
And your beloved brother Benjamin
would be pleased as well.

1470
02:20:24,382 --> 02:20:27,874
I wonder what sort of a man
Benjamin has become.

1471
02:20:29,321 --> 02:20:31,482
Perhaps he, too, has a son.

1472
02:20:32,324 --> 02:20:34,451
But it's not for me to know.

1473
02:20:34,626 --> 02:20:35,854
Not yet.

1474
02:20:36,561 --> 02:20:39,587
God in his own good time will decide.

1475
02:20:45,603 --> 02:20:48,003
My place now is here...

1476
02:20:48,440 --> 02:20:50,135
... with you...

1477
02:20:50,742 --> 02:20:52,141
... and Manasseh.

1478
02:20:56,281 --> 02:20:58,215
Manasseh! Ephraim!

1479
02:20:59,784 --> 02:21:02,446
- Ready?
- Ready!

1480
02:21:06,124 --> 02:21:08,183
- Father, Father!
- Father, Father!

1481
02:21:08,360 --> 02:21:10,385
Manasseh, Ephraim.

1482
02:21:10,562 --> 02:21:13,156
You should be learning the ciphers.

1483
02:21:17,535 --> 02:21:19,696
Season started well.

1484
02:21:19,871 --> 02:21:23,739
The Nile flooded, but the rains
didn't last long enough.

1485
02:21:23,908 --> 02:21:28,242
If it goes on like this,
there'll be no crop to speak of this year.

1486
02:21:31,850 --> 02:21:34,717
Zaphenath-paneah! Come quickly!

1487
02:21:34,886 --> 02:21:38,822
Fires are raging out of control
in the fields north of the city.

1488
02:21:45,864 --> 02:21:47,695
It's begun...

1489
02:21:50,568 --> 02:21:52,866
... as God promised.

1490
02:23:20,758 --> 02:23:22,919
The wells are clogging, but they'll hold.

1491
02:23:23,094 --> 02:23:27,394
And for a while, at any rate, there'll be
water to drink. But the grain runs low.

1492
02:23:27,565 --> 02:23:30,591
Two phases of the moon
and we'll have to eat the animals...

1493
02:23:30,768 --> 02:23:32,292
... instead of feeding them.

1494
02:23:32,470 --> 02:23:33,994
Once they are gone, Father...

1495
02:23:34,172 --> 02:23:36,732
And without grain for us
and the animals...

1496
02:23:37,108 --> 02:23:39,167
Starvation kills us all.

1497
02:23:39,344 --> 02:23:41,141
Unless...

1498
02:23:42,247 --> 02:23:45,011
Well, Hirah, my old friend and ally...

1499
02:23:45,183 --> 02:23:49,017
... says the reports of vast stocks
of grain and fodder in Egypt are true.

1500
02:23:49,187 --> 02:23:53,089
Which is all well and good for the
Egyptians, but why should they care...

1501
02:23:53,258 --> 02:23:55,158
... what happens to us?
- They don't.

1502
02:23:55,326 --> 02:23:57,954
But they do care
what happens to our money.

1503
02:23:58,129 --> 02:24:01,656
He's already sent his caravan
with silver and loom-work to trade.

1504
02:24:01,833 --> 02:24:04,961
As if an Egyptian trader can be trusted.

1505
02:24:06,738 --> 02:24:08,899
Listen for once.

1506
02:24:09,741 --> 02:24:12,733
It's not in the hands
of private traders.

1507
02:24:12,911 --> 02:24:16,677
Their Pharaoh has set one man
above all others to supervise his affairs.

1508
02:24:16,848 --> 02:24:18,076
You deal with him.

1509
02:24:19,918 --> 02:24:23,581
We are not people who measure
our wealth in silver.

1510
02:24:23,755 --> 02:24:27,521
We can't carry fields to Egypt.
The animals would die before we arrived.

1511
02:24:27,692 --> 02:24:31,958
- We'd better move eastward.
- Asher, don't interrupt.

1512
02:24:32,430 --> 02:24:34,489
Over the years...

1513
02:24:34,666 --> 02:24:37,100
... the tribe has earned
some silver and gold.

1514
02:24:37,268 --> 02:24:41,261
I've kept it because I believed that one day
God would show us a use for it.

1515
02:24:41,573 --> 02:24:44,098
Could there be a better use than this?

1516
02:24:44,742 --> 02:24:47,142
No, I think not.

1517
02:24:47,312 --> 02:24:50,304
It's a long trek,
and the roads are filled with thieves.

1518
02:24:50,481 --> 02:24:52,813
Which is why you must all go.

1519
02:24:52,984 --> 02:24:56,476
Properly armed, you'll find
there's safety in numbers.

1520
02:24:56,754 --> 02:25:00,315
All of us? And who
will tend to things here?

1521
02:25:00,491 --> 02:25:03,289
There'll be nothing to tend
if you don't go.

1522
02:25:03,528 --> 02:25:05,189
All of you...

1523
02:25:07,098 --> 02:25:08,531
... except for Benjamin.

1524
02:25:08,700 --> 02:25:10,065
- But, Father...
- Enough.

1525
02:25:10,234 --> 02:25:15,001
You're the last link to Rachel left.
I will not see you lost as I did Joseph.

1526
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:19,503
Prepare the animals.
You leave at nightfall.

1527
02:25:20,211 --> 02:25:22,008
I'll give you the silver then.

1528
02:25:31,656 --> 02:25:35,956
First he raised Joseph above us,
now Benjamin.

1529
02:25:36,127 --> 02:25:37,822
Then so be it!

1530
02:25:37,996 --> 02:25:41,955
We'll not tease God a second time.

1531
02:26:53,671 --> 02:26:55,662
- Ednan.
- Yes, master, it's just...

1532
02:26:55,840 --> 02:27:00,800
- Well, this man's dialect. I know...
- Never mind. Give him what he needs.

1533
02:27:04,582 --> 02:27:06,550
Go. Go!

1534
02:27:13,991 --> 02:27:16,357
Are you well, Zaphenath-paneah?

1535
02:27:16,527 --> 02:27:19,826
They're here. I'm sure they're here.

1536
02:27:19,997 --> 02:27:21,589
Who?

1537
02:27:22,500 --> 02:27:24,468
My brothers.

1538
02:27:27,038 --> 02:27:30,337
- Your brothers?
- The ones in Canaanite dress.

1539
02:27:30,508 --> 02:27:32,601
What should I do, master?

1540
02:27:36,047 --> 02:27:37,981
Bring them to me.

1541
02:27:41,686 --> 02:27:44,985
You, you, you.
Come, all of you, come!

1542
02:27:47,158 --> 02:27:50,616
This way. Bring them all.
All of these men.

1543
02:27:50,862 --> 02:27:53,296
You, you, you, come! And you!

1544
02:28:07,478 --> 02:28:09,343
Lift your heads.

1545
02:28:09,781 --> 02:28:12,079
Look upon your master.

1546
02:28:30,935 --> 02:28:32,869
They don't even recognize me.

1547
02:28:33,304 --> 02:28:35,431
O mighty one, have mercy.

1548
02:28:37,108 --> 02:28:40,942
We come from Canaan,
where the drought destroys everything.

1549
02:28:41,312 --> 02:28:43,940
We bring silver to trade...

1550
02:28:44,115 --> 02:28:47,380
... so that we and our families
might survive.

1551
02:28:51,889 --> 02:28:54,016
Your master, Zaphenath-paneah...

1552
02:28:54,192 --> 02:28:57,628
... asks why your Canaanite gods
do not provide for your needs.

1553
02:28:58,262 --> 02:29:01,390
We're not like the other Canaanites,
great master.

1554
02:29:02,033 --> 02:29:04,092
We worship our own God.

1555
02:29:04,569 --> 02:29:08,130
But we sojourn in the land of Canaan.

1556
02:29:10,575 --> 02:29:14,272
- The master says you are spies.
- Spies?

1557
02:29:14,445 --> 02:29:18,040
No, master.
Our father sent us to buy food.

1558
02:29:20,852 --> 02:29:25,812
The master says no, you are spies,
sent to see the weakness of Egypt.

1559
02:29:25,990 --> 02:29:30,051
No, master. We are nothing more than
shepherds, sons of Jacob, son of Isaac.

1560
02:29:33,030 --> 02:29:38,024
What man would send all his sons
on such a mission and leave himself alone?

1561
02:29:42,640 --> 02:29:45,666
What you see are not all his sons.

1562
02:29:46,310 --> 02:29:48,335
One other...

1563
02:29:48,779 --> 02:29:50,337
... the youngest...

1564
02:29:50,514 --> 02:29:54,143
... he is called Benjamin,
remains with our father.

1565
02:29:56,153 --> 02:29:59,748
A man is fortunate indeed
to have such a wealth of sons.

1566
02:30:00,524 --> 02:30:03,322
Are you sure you speak the truth
of your number?

1567
02:30:04,562 --> 02:30:07,429
There was one other, master.

1568
02:30:08,132 --> 02:30:13,126
A brother called Joseph,
but he was taken from us.

1569
02:30:25,316 --> 02:30:29,013
What enemy would send
10 brothers as spies?

1570
02:30:29,186 --> 02:30:31,654
One or two perhaps, but 10?

1571
02:30:33,024 --> 02:30:35,322
Take them! Now! Take them!

1572
02:30:35,493 --> 02:30:37,654
No! No!

1573
02:31:14,799 --> 02:31:19,930
Why us? There were hundreds there today,
and the Egyptians picked us out to be spies.

1574
02:31:20,104 --> 02:31:21,969
We must be able
to prove he's wrong.

1575
02:31:22,139 --> 02:31:23,834
What would you suggest, brother?

1576
02:31:24,008 --> 02:31:26,977
We probably wouldn't be here
if you'd paid more respect.

1577
02:31:27,144 --> 02:31:28,406
Leave it alone!

1578
02:31:28,579 --> 02:31:31,514
"One or two brothers perhaps, but 10?"

1579
02:31:31,682 --> 02:31:34,048
What kind of fool uses
an excuse like that?

1580
02:31:34,218 --> 02:31:38,279
Stop it! Stop it!
Arguing won't get us out of here.

1581
02:31:38,456 --> 02:31:40,754
- Then what will?
- Not what, but who!

1582
02:31:41,158 --> 02:31:45,185
God. Is this his final punishment
for what we did?

1583
02:31:45,363 --> 02:31:46,455
No!

1584
02:31:46,630 --> 02:31:49,292
Now we know how Joseph must have felt.

1585
02:31:49,467 --> 02:31:53,699
Not quite! We have each other.
You left him alone!

1586
02:31:53,871 --> 02:31:55,361
"You"? We!

1587
02:31:55,539 --> 02:31:59,635
We put him in the well.
There's no point dwelling on that!

1588
02:31:59,810 --> 02:32:02,210
For 20 years,
you've harped on the same thing.

1589
02:32:02,380 --> 02:32:07,477
But what's done is done! And one thing
has nothing to do with another!

1590
02:32:07,651 --> 02:32:09,710
Are you sure, brother?

1591
02:32:09,887 --> 02:32:12,082
That's the last you speak of it!

1592
02:32:12,490 --> 02:32:14,390
Reuben, no!

1593
02:32:15,393 --> 02:32:18,989
- Give it back, it's mine!
- No! It's mine. I found it.

1594
02:32:19,164 --> 02:32:20,392
I did.

1595
02:32:20,565 --> 02:32:21,930
No.

1596
02:32:22,567 --> 02:32:25,263
Manasseh. Ephraim.

1597
02:32:30,976 --> 02:32:33,604
Look what Manasseh did.

1598
02:32:37,049 --> 02:32:39,677
Yes, yes, we can't have that.

1599
02:32:40,018 --> 02:32:43,249
Joseph, are you ill?

1600
02:32:49,061 --> 02:32:50,995
Then what is it?

1601
02:32:52,464 --> 02:32:54,125
I saw my brothers today.

1602
02:32:54,299 --> 02:32:56,130
That's wonderful.

1603
02:32:56,301 --> 02:32:59,464
You always said they'd come to you.

1604
02:33:00,138 --> 02:33:02,732
More good fortune from the troubles.

1605
02:33:02,908 --> 02:33:05,877
They came to the granary.
The drought has reached Canaan.

1606
02:33:06,912 --> 02:33:10,370
I wish I could've been there
to see their faces when they saw you.

1607
02:33:10,549 --> 02:33:12,346
The governor of all of Egypt.

1608
02:33:13,752 --> 02:33:16,220
You would have been disappointed.

1609
02:33:18,523 --> 02:33:23,392
I've waited all these years,
and then they didn't even recognize me.

1610
02:33:23,595 --> 02:33:25,187
How can that be possible?

1611
02:33:26,264 --> 02:33:29,893
It's been over 20 years since
they last saw me. I was still a boy.

1612
02:33:30,735 --> 02:33:32,896
Not surprising.

1613
02:33:34,172 --> 02:33:35,469
Where are they now?

1614
02:33:36,708 --> 02:33:37,936
In the prison.

1615
02:33:56,294 --> 02:33:58,262
In the prison?

1616
02:33:58,563 --> 02:34:00,190
Why?

1617
02:34:00,866 --> 02:34:04,324
Because my anger was stronger
than my compassion.

1618
02:34:08,406 --> 02:34:10,840
And what will you do with them?

1619
02:34:11,009 --> 02:34:14,968
My father's people are in need of food.
I must send them back.

1620
02:34:15,280 --> 02:34:17,840
Why not just reveal yourself to them.

1621
02:34:18,016 --> 02:34:20,746
Because they seem unchanged...

1622
02:34:20,919 --> 02:34:23,752
... no different from when
they betrayed me.

1623
02:34:26,158 --> 02:34:28,456
Perhaps God will reveal a way
to test them.

1624
02:34:28,627 --> 02:34:30,254
How?

1625
02:34:31,129 --> 02:34:33,029
I'm not sure.

1626
02:34:36,801 --> 02:34:42,034
Well, I want to see these men
to whom I owe my happiness.

1627
02:34:42,207 --> 02:34:46,166
After all, it was their cruelty
that brought you here...

1628
02:34:46,344 --> 02:34:50,007
... gave you to me, saved Egypt.

1629
02:34:50,649 --> 02:34:55,882
And it's to them our children
owe their existence.

1630
02:34:57,222 --> 02:35:00,316
Another of your curious insights.

1631
02:35:01,693 --> 02:35:04,992
But I'm not so sure God is ready
to see this thing forgotten.

1632
02:35:05,163 --> 02:35:07,597
God, or you?

1633
02:35:10,135 --> 02:35:11,830
You must bring them.

1634
02:35:12,003 --> 02:35:15,097
I have to at least meet little Benjamin.

1635
02:35:15,273 --> 02:35:18,003
Benjamin was left with my father.

1636
02:35:18,176 --> 02:35:20,076
I'm sorry.

1637
02:35:21,746 --> 02:35:24,681
I know he's the one who counted most.

1638
02:35:26,885 --> 02:35:28,876
But they are all your brothers.

1639
02:35:29,054 --> 02:35:31,249
Blood of your blood.

1640
02:35:39,397 --> 02:35:41,729
Your master, Zaphenath-paneah...

1641
02:35:41,900 --> 02:35:45,427
... will allow you to buy the grain
you need to feed your people.

1642
02:35:45,837 --> 02:35:48,772
These sacks have provisions
for your journey.

1643
02:35:49,174 --> 02:35:51,802
But the accusations against you
still stand.

1644
02:35:51,977 --> 02:35:55,936
Evidence that your story is true
and you're not spies...

1645
02:35:56,581 --> 02:36:00,073
... will depend upon proof of the existence
of the missing brother.

1646
02:36:00,252 --> 02:36:04,780
But your master, Zaphenath-paneah,
is a merciful man.

1647
02:36:04,956 --> 02:36:07,982
Thus, he will keep only one of you here.

1648
02:36:08,293 --> 02:36:12,525
He will be released when the rest of you
return from Canaan with that brother.

1649
02:36:12,697 --> 02:36:17,396
You wish us to return to our father,
then journey once again to Egypt?

1650
02:36:17,569 --> 02:36:20,663
Yes. With the missing brother.

1651
02:36:22,641 --> 02:36:26,509
- That one shall remain with us.
- No! No! No!

1652
02:36:26,678 --> 02:36:28,509
Now, go!

1653
02:36:29,047 --> 02:36:30,605
Leave!

1654
02:36:48,600 --> 02:36:51,228
And return swiftly
with the missing brother.

1655
02:36:52,170 --> 02:36:54,434
You've probably seen the last of them.

1656
02:36:55,307 --> 02:36:58,174
It will be difficult
for them to keep away.

1657
02:36:58,343 --> 02:37:00,641
The drought has just begun.

1658
02:37:01,546 --> 02:37:04,515
The silver they gave in payment,
did you do what I asked?

1659
02:37:05,383 --> 02:37:07,112
As ever, master.

1660
02:37:42,253 --> 02:37:45,279
There's some water here, at least.

1661
02:37:45,457 --> 02:37:48,255
We camp here tonight.

1662
02:37:51,229 --> 02:37:54,357
Issacar! Issacar!

1663
02:37:54,532 --> 02:37:58,491
Open your bag of grain
and feed the animals.

1664
02:38:05,443 --> 02:38:06,910
What's this?

1665
02:38:09,114 --> 02:38:12,743
The silver I used to buy the grain.

1666
02:38:13,585 --> 02:38:16,952
What kind of game
is God playing with us now?

1667
02:38:19,524 --> 02:38:21,788
We can't stay here.

1668
02:38:21,960 --> 02:38:26,090
Feed the animals quickly.
We'll travel through the night.

1669
02:38:33,438 --> 02:38:36,305
Father! Father's home!

1670
02:38:36,474 --> 02:38:38,840
Father's returned!

1671
02:38:39,210 --> 02:38:41,770
Father! Father!

1672
02:38:49,254 --> 02:38:51,154
Levi.

1673
02:38:51,356 --> 02:38:53,517
Naphtali.

1674
02:38:53,691 --> 02:38:55,556
- No!
- The only proof of our story...

1675
02:38:55,727 --> 02:38:57,194
... he'll accept is Benjamin.

1676
02:38:57,362 --> 02:38:59,728
And the only way to redeem Simeon.

1677
02:38:59,898 --> 02:39:03,493
But after that, he promises
we can trade freely in Egypt.

1678
02:39:03,668 --> 02:39:05,863
The grain is abundant, the best quality.

1679
02:39:06,037 --> 02:39:08,801
Is this is all the Egyptian asks?

1680
02:39:08,973 --> 02:39:11,339
Just for my youngest?

1681
02:39:11,509 --> 02:39:14,535
Is there more to this sorry tale?

1682
02:39:17,115 --> 02:39:18,946
What is that?

1683
02:39:19,651 --> 02:39:22,449
The money with which
we purchased the grain.

1684
02:39:23,054 --> 02:39:25,386
What's it doing here?

1685
02:39:25,723 --> 02:39:28,487
We don't know, Father. Perhaps God...

1686
02:39:28,660 --> 02:39:31,754
Be careful what you lay
at the door of the Lord.

1687
02:39:31,930 --> 02:39:35,161
- Blessed be his name.
- Blessed be his name.

1688
02:39:35,333 --> 02:39:39,599
Why? Why did you tell this man
I had another son?

1689
02:39:39,771 --> 02:39:43,673
First I lose Joseph, then Simeon.

1690
02:39:44,209 --> 02:39:50,148
And you, poor soul,
want me to give him Benjamin.

1691
02:39:50,315 --> 02:39:52,442
Well, hear my words.
It will not happen.

1692
02:39:52,617 --> 02:39:57,816
I will never, never risk Benjamin
to your care. Never!

1693
02:39:57,989 --> 02:40:01,720
But, Father, Simeon rots in an
Egyptian jail like a common criminal.

1694
02:40:01,893 --> 02:40:04,418
How do I know Benjamin
won't meet that same fate?

1695
02:40:04,596 --> 02:40:07,429
Or this Egyptian might put you all
to the sword?

1696
02:40:07,599 --> 02:40:10,124
- Perhaps if I went...
- You have no say in this.

1697
02:40:10,301 --> 02:40:11,791
Father!

1698
02:40:12,804 --> 02:40:16,069
I cannot leave Simeon there.

1699
02:40:16,241 --> 02:40:21,474
Please, let me do
as this Egyptian suggests.

1700
02:40:21,646 --> 02:40:26,083
If we don't return, I offer you
the lives of my own two sons.

1701
02:40:26,251 --> 02:40:29,345
A typical idea of yours, Reuben.

1702
02:40:29,521 --> 02:40:33,514
If I lose Benjamin, I can begin
exterminating my entire family.

1703
02:40:33,691 --> 02:40:36,057
Is that your grand solution?

1704
02:40:36,227 --> 02:40:38,092
Now, hear me!

1705
02:40:38,830 --> 02:40:41,162
This is my last son by Rachel.

1706
02:40:41,332 --> 02:40:44,062
I will not risk losing him.

1707
02:40:44,435 --> 02:40:48,462
Now, go about your business and pray.

1708
02:40:48,873 --> 02:40:53,708
Pray that the grain you brought back
will outlast the drought.

1709
02:41:04,422 --> 02:41:09,655
Nowhere to go, Father.
We don't have many choices left.

1710
02:41:14,399 --> 02:41:18,802
You know my mind in this matter!
We will not talk of it again!

1711
02:41:22,373 --> 02:41:25,570
Another month
and we'll not talk of anything.

1712
02:41:27,812 --> 02:41:30,508
Soon we will all die...

1713
02:41:30,682 --> 02:41:35,642
... and the line started by Abraham
will have vanished.

1714
02:41:36,654 --> 02:41:39,418
And what would you have me do?

1715
02:41:39,591 --> 02:41:44,028
Listen for once.
Think about what God promised you.

1716
02:41:44,195 --> 02:41:49,360
Then listen to your sons and see if what
they have to say doesn't make sense.

1717
02:41:49,534 --> 02:41:51,593
Unless you want to see us all die...

1718
02:41:51,769 --> 02:41:54,169
... because you're too frightened
to trust God.

1719
02:41:54,339 --> 02:41:57,706
What has this to do with trusting God?

1720
02:41:57,875 --> 02:41:59,809
Isn't it obvious?

1721
02:41:59,978 --> 02:42:02,742
He's left you only one way out.

1722
02:42:02,914 --> 02:42:05,212
One road to our survival.

1723
02:42:05,383 --> 02:42:07,943
And it leads through Egypt.

1724
02:42:08,119 --> 02:42:11,680
Egypt is our only salvation, Jacob.

1725
02:42:23,334 --> 02:42:25,734
Jacob. Come.

1726
02:42:43,588 --> 02:42:46,921
These are the finest gifts we can offer.

1727
02:42:47,091 --> 02:42:52,051
Present them to the Egyptian
along with this.

1728
02:42:52,563 --> 02:42:55,396
Silver enough for double payment...

1729
02:42:55,566 --> 02:43:00,367
... for the grain you will buy
and the grain you brought back.

1730
02:43:18,956 --> 02:43:21,447
Have an easy mind, Father.

1731
02:43:21,626 --> 02:43:23,594
All will be well.

1732
02:43:23,761 --> 02:43:25,752
I know it.

1733
02:43:26,431 --> 02:43:28,729
May God go with you
at your right hand...

1734
02:43:28,900 --> 02:43:31,562
... and bring you back safely to me.

1735
02:44:16,848 --> 02:44:19,976
Why have we been brought here
to the great one's house?

1736
02:44:20,151 --> 02:44:22,642
Because of the silver
we found in our sacks.

1737
02:44:22,820 --> 02:44:26,483
But we don't know how it got there.
All we need do is be truthful.

1738
02:44:26,657 --> 02:44:28,249
Silver?

1739
02:44:28,426 --> 02:44:29,950
What silver?

1740
02:44:30,361 --> 02:44:33,091
I know I received payment for your grain.

1741
02:44:33,264 --> 02:44:35,425
But we had money
in our grain nonetheless.

1742
02:44:35,600 --> 02:44:38,228
Here, we offer double repayment.

1743
02:44:38,836 --> 02:44:44,365
You owe us nothing. Whatever you found
must be a gift from that god of yours.

1744
02:44:45,643 --> 02:44:49,170
Master, our other brother, Simeon.

1745
02:44:49,347 --> 02:44:52,475
- He's in health?
- Alive, you mean?

1746
02:45:04,195 --> 02:45:06,220
Simeon!

1747
02:45:06,931 --> 02:45:09,798
Welcome to Egypt!

1748
02:45:12,570 --> 02:45:13,798
Are you all right?

1749
02:45:13,971 --> 02:45:15,962
- Where did you get the tunic?
- Is that linen?

1750
02:45:16,140 --> 02:45:20,236
The answer to every question is yes.
I don't really understand it.

1751
02:45:20,411 --> 02:45:23,642
But from the time you went away,
I sat back...

1752
02:45:23,815 --> 02:45:27,444
... eating and drinking
like the Pharaoh himself.

1753
02:45:27,752 --> 02:45:32,280
Come. You must be washed
before you dine with the master.

1754
02:46:11,963 --> 02:46:14,056
You will sit here...

1755
02:46:14,465 --> 02:46:16,956
... aside from the master.

1756
02:46:17,268 --> 02:46:19,133
This is a great honor.

1757
02:46:19,303 --> 02:46:22,033
Egyptians never eat with strangers.

1758
02:46:22,206 --> 02:46:25,403
To them, it is considered
an abomination.

1759
02:46:25,576 --> 02:46:29,876
Now, you will sit in the order I tell you.

1760
02:46:30,047 --> 02:46:31,571
Please.

1761
02:46:36,387 --> 02:46:39,413
Benjamin, you will sit here.

1762
02:46:39,590 --> 02:46:42,423
So that's Benjamin.

1763
02:46:42,727 --> 02:46:45,958
A handsome young man
if ever I saw one.

1764
02:46:46,130 --> 02:46:49,566
- And I hope a pure spirit.
- Gad.

1765
02:46:51,802 --> 02:46:54,828
- Enough delay.
- Asher.

1766
02:46:55,740 --> 02:46:57,367
Issacar.

1767
02:46:59,010 --> 02:47:00,910
Zebulon.

1768
02:47:05,283 --> 02:47:07,547
Zaphenath-paneah...

1769
02:47:07,718 --> 02:47:10,710
... he who guides us on the road of life.

1770
02:47:17,495 --> 02:47:19,588
Lift up your heads.

1771
02:47:29,640 --> 02:47:32,700
Your master asks,
is your father in good health?

1772
02:47:41,185 --> 02:47:45,747
Yes, master, and he sends you
these gifts as homage.

1773
02:47:53,331 --> 02:47:56,027
So this is the brother
of whom you spoke.

1774
02:48:03,808 --> 02:48:05,400
What is your name?

1775
02:48:06,444 --> 02:48:09,038
I am Benjamin, master.

1776
02:48:09,413 --> 02:48:12,541
How is it, master,
that you come to speak our tongue?

1777
02:48:12,717 --> 02:48:14,947
Have you been to our land?

1778
02:48:19,490 --> 02:48:21,515
God be gracious to you, my son.

1779
02:48:31,202 --> 02:48:34,831
Was I wrong to ask the master
how he came to speak our tongue?

1780
02:48:35,539 --> 02:48:38,201
The master has traveled widely.

1781
02:48:39,543 --> 02:48:41,408
He understands a great deal.

1782
02:48:44,515 --> 02:48:48,212
Look. We're sitting according
to the order of our birth.

1783
02:48:48,619 --> 02:48:50,348
Reuben...

1784
02:48:50,521 --> 02:48:52,250
... and Simeon...

1785
02:48:52,423 --> 02:48:53,856
... Levi...

1786
02:48:54,025 --> 02:48:55,788
... Judah, Dan...

1787
02:48:55,960 --> 02:48:58,360
... Naphtali, Gad and Asher...

1788
02:48:58,529 --> 02:49:00,224
... Issacar, Zebulon...

1789
02:49:00,398 --> 02:49:02,229
... finally me.

1790
02:49:02,800 --> 02:49:07,328
I divined the order of your birth
by looking into my magic cup.

1791
02:49:25,923 --> 02:49:27,914
It is a great honor.

1792
02:49:28,225 --> 02:49:31,661
The master has given you the food
from his own plate.

1793
02:49:32,229 --> 02:49:34,163
Thank you, master.

1794
02:49:34,598 --> 02:49:36,327
We eat the same dish at home.

1795
02:49:36,500 --> 02:49:39,765
In fact, this is the favorite food
of my father.

1796
02:49:57,621 --> 02:49:59,851
I could have done
with a little more sleep.

1797
02:50:00,024 --> 02:50:03,391
I don't understand.
He was so friendly last night.

1798
02:50:03,561 --> 02:50:07,053
Yet now he has us roused from our beds
before the cock crows...

1799
02:50:07,231 --> 02:50:09,165
... and sends us on our way.

1800
02:50:09,333 --> 02:50:13,360
Look, our asses are already
loaded down with grain.

1801
02:50:34,258 --> 02:50:36,988
Why did you return good with evil?

1802
02:50:37,495 --> 02:50:41,226
- What can you possibly mean?
- You deny stealing from my master?

1803
02:50:41,398 --> 02:50:44,492
What kind of fools
would you take us for?

1804
02:50:50,474 --> 02:50:52,032
This.

1805
02:51:16,534 --> 02:51:20,561
If you find anything,
you can kill the culprit...

1806
02:51:20,738 --> 02:51:23,639
... and make slaves of the rest of us.

1807
02:51:38,656 --> 02:51:44,094
What have you done, you little fool?
Have you taken leave of your senses?

1808
02:51:47,264 --> 02:51:49,824
Why did you do such a wicked thing?

1809
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:53,731
- Master, we have done nothing.
- Then how do you explain it?

1810
02:51:56,907 --> 02:52:00,741
God is punishing us for a crime
we committed many years ago.

1811
02:52:01,378 --> 02:52:05,337
It seems he wants us all to taste
the bitterness of slavery...

1812
02:52:06,083 --> 02:52:09,018
... for surely we are all your slaves now.

1813
02:52:17,696 --> 02:52:20,256
I am not a vindictive man.

1814
02:52:20,799 --> 02:52:23,859
You can return to your father,
I shall keep only Benjamin.

1815
02:52:24,803 --> 02:52:27,067
- No!
- You dare raise your voice to me?

1816
02:52:27,239 --> 02:52:29,605
Men can die for less.

1817
02:52:32,210 --> 02:52:34,178
A thousand pardons, master...

1818
02:52:34,346 --> 02:52:36,610
... but the very idea is unthinkable.

1819
02:52:37,215 --> 02:52:43,120
Master, I cannot pretend to grasp
the meaning of these strange happenings.

1820
02:52:43,288 --> 02:52:46,553
- Benjamin has never stolen in his life.
- Never, master.

1821
02:52:46,891 --> 02:52:51,260
And he's too clever to take a cherished
object from a man as powerful as you.

1822
02:52:52,097 --> 02:52:55,123
Nor do I know how the money
got into our sacks previously.

1823
02:52:55,834 --> 02:52:58,394
Perhaps it was all the work of God.

1824
02:52:59,571 --> 02:53:04,372
Master, please. Spare the life of Benjamin,
beloved son of our father's old age.

1825
02:53:04,609 --> 02:53:07,442
Losing Benjamin
would kill our old father...

1826
02:53:07,612 --> 02:53:10,274
... whom we have
already wounded deeply.

1827
02:53:12,784 --> 02:53:15,014
Take me as a slave in place of Benjamin.

1828
02:53:15,186 --> 02:53:17,211
Allow the boy
to go home to his father.

1829
02:53:17,389 --> 02:53:20,085
No. Benjamin will stay with me.

1830
02:53:30,335 --> 02:53:31,802
No!

1831
02:53:36,508 --> 02:53:40,410
I'm sorry, master, but we must take
the boy back to our father!

1832
02:53:40,578 --> 02:53:42,011
Or die in the attempt?

1833
02:53:42,180 --> 02:53:45,741
We'd rather die 1000 times than
see such pain in our father's eyes again!

1834
02:53:45,917 --> 02:53:49,114
Or live another 20 years
of wretched cowardice!

1835
02:54:00,699 --> 02:54:02,257
No, master!

1836
02:54:08,206 --> 02:54:12,973
So you are now ready to sacrifice
your lives for one of your brothers?

1837
02:54:15,046 --> 02:54:17,810
Why, then, did you not do the same
for the other one?

1838
02:54:17,982 --> 02:54:23,045
The one you said died, when, in truth,
you yourselves sold him into slavery.

1839
02:54:23,421 --> 02:54:25,685
You know about Joseph?

1840
02:54:25,857 --> 02:54:27,381
How?

1841
02:54:28,927 --> 02:54:32,385
- Because he is alive.
- What?

1842
02:54:32,997 --> 02:54:35,795
- He's here in this palace.
- Joseph, alive?

1843
02:54:40,205 --> 02:54:42,730
In fact, he's in this room.

1844
02:54:47,445 --> 02:54:49,174
Leave us.

1845
02:54:49,948 --> 02:54:52,439
I said, leave us. Get out!

1846
02:54:54,953 --> 02:54:57,683
Guards! Come!

1847
02:55:34,192 --> 02:55:35,921
I am Joseph.

1848
02:55:41,132 --> 02:55:42,656
Joseph?

1849
02:55:50,041 --> 02:55:51,406
Joseph?

1850
02:55:53,111 --> 02:55:54,840
It is...

1851
02:55:55,346 --> 02:55:57,644
... my brother Joseph!

1852
02:56:03,922 --> 02:56:07,790
Yes. It is I.

1853
02:56:08,393 --> 02:56:10,793
But be at peace.

1854
02:56:20,438 --> 02:56:21,735
Come closer.

1855
02:56:22,974 --> 02:56:27,274
Don't be afraid, I will not harm you.
Am I to take the place of God?

1856
02:56:27,445 --> 02:56:29,037
Joseph.

1857
02:56:30,014 --> 02:56:32,778
It is not for me to punish you.

1858
02:56:36,588 --> 02:56:39,455
You meant evil against me, yes.

1859
02:56:43,628 --> 02:56:45,960
But God meant it for good.

1860
02:56:46,130 --> 02:56:50,294
To bring it about that many people
should be kept alive, as they are today.

1861
02:56:56,474 --> 02:56:58,533
So fear not.

1862
02:56:59,511 --> 02:57:02,878
I shall provide for you
and for your families...

1863
02:57:03,481 --> 02:57:05,415
... and especially for our father.

1864
02:57:14,425 --> 02:57:17,553
I am most to blame.

1865
02:57:26,538 --> 02:57:29,336
I deserve to be enslaved...

1866
02:57:29,507 --> 02:57:32,408
... or killed.

1867
02:57:33,478 --> 02:57:35,139
No.

1868
02:57:35,580 --> 02:57:37,480
My brother...

1869
02:57:37,715 --> 02:57:40,377
... I shall not kill you.

1870
02:57:42,453 --> 02:57:47,117
That is not the lesson the Lord,
blessed be his name, has put before us.

1871
02:57:47,292 --> 02:57:49,886
Blessed be his name.

1872
02:57:50,728 --> 02:57:55,995
Perhaps we have learned the meaning
of brotherhood, of family.

1873
02:57:56,167 --> 02:57:59,864
And that wherever we may go,
no matter how God's plan separates us...

1874
02:58:00,038 --> 02:58:03,166
... we must always be true
to one another...

1875
02:58:03,975 --> 02:58:06,307
... to be family.

1876
02:58:16,454 --> 02:58:18,820
You must return for our father.

1877
02:58:19,023 --> 02:58:23,551
Tell him of what I have achieved and
move him here with all your belongings.

1878
02:58:23,728 --> 02:58:26,356
I want you near me
so I may provide for you...

1879
02:58:26,531 --> 02:58:30,399
... during the remaining years of the famine.
I have spoken to the Pharaoh.

1880
02:58:30,568 --> 02:58:32,160
All is prepared.

1881
02:58:34,505 --> 02:58:36,302
Come to me.

1882
02:58:36,741 --> 02:58:38,641
Come to me.

1883
02:58:39,944 --> 02:58:41,935
I'm your brother.

1884
02:58:42,747 --> 02:58:44,806
I am Joseph.

1885
02:58:50,588 --> 02:58:52,818
Blessed be his name.

1886
02:58:52,991 --> 02:58:56,586
- Blessed be his name.
- Blessed be his name.

1887
03:01:24,675 --> 03:01:26,165
Father.

1888
03:01:26,344 --> 03:01:27,902
Father.

1889
03:01:28,079 --> 03:01:30,980
Truly, this is my Joseph.

1890
03:01:31,149 --> 03:01:34,778
My son, my son.

1891
03:01:46,831 --> 03:01:50,323
I did not think
to ever see your face again.

1892
03:02:08,219 --> 03:02:12,918
And these, I see to be my grandchildren.

1893
03:02:13,391 --> 03:02:16,155
Rachel's light shines in their eyes.

1894
03:02:16,327 --> 03:02:18,852
Come, come, my children.

1895
03:02:19,130 --> 03:02:21,655
Come that I might bless you.

1896
03:02:23,201 --> 03:02:24,691
Come.

1897
03:02:42,220 --> 03:02:45,849
I am indeed blessed that I have again
held you in my arms...

1898
03:02:46,023 --> 03:02:48,958
... and laid eyes upon your sons.

1899
03:02:49,126 --> 03:02:52,823
Now, truly, I can die in peace.

1900
03:02:53,364 --> 03:02:56,458
There will be no talk of death, my father.

1901
03:02:56,634 --> 03:02:58,898
Then God will it.

1902
03:03:01,405 --> 03:03:04,806
<i>And then you will</i>
<i>take me back to Canaan... </i>

1903
03:03:04,976 --> 03:03:08,275
<i>... the land God promised Abraham. </i>

1904
03:03:08,446 --> 03:03:11,609
<i>And it will be as the Lord promised. </i>

1905
03:03:11,782 --> 03:03:15,684
<i>Our descendants</i>
<i>shall be known as Israel... </i>

1906
03:03:15,853 --> 03:03:18,617
<i>... and will be a multitude of nations... </i>

1907
03:03:18,789 --> 03:03:21,724
<i>... each brother unto himself... </i>

1908
03:03:21,893 --> 03:03:24,885
<i>... a tribe of Israel. </i>

1909
03:05:09,066 --> 03:05:11,057
