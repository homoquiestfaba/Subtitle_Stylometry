1
00:02:07,307 --> 00:02:09,275
Walter, honey.

2
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:11,142
Time to wake up.

3
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:12,504
Just 10 more minutes.

4
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:14,809
Oh, I'm sorry, sport.
You can sleep in tomorrow.

5
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:16,473
That's what
Saturdays are for.

6
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:25,522
Up against the wall.

7
00:02:25,592 --> 00:02:28,152
Come, come, come.

8
00:02:28,328 --> 00:02:29,659
All right.

9
00:02:29,763 --> 00:02:31,856
Got it. Got it.
Look, look!

10
00:02:31,932 --> 00:02:33,331
All right, sit down.

11
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,890
Your breakfast
is getting cold.

12
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:36,299
It's cereal.

13
00:02:36,369 --> 00:02:37,802
It's supposed to be cold.

14
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,286
Sweetheart, we're here.

15
00:03:01,928 --> 00:03:03,054
Okay.

16
00:03:15,575 --> 00:03:17,236
Here's your books.

17
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,572
Go ahead.

18
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:06,390
Yes, ma'am. If you hold just a
moment, I'll get a supervisor for you.

19
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:09,285
Yes,
she's coming right now.

20
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:10,920
Just a second,
she'll be with you.

21
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:14,899
Just one second, please. You deal
with this one. I'm not going near it.

22
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:18,871
Hello, this is the supervisor.
How can I help you?

23
00:04:20,273 --> 00:04:22,138
I can see you're
on a party line...

24
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:26,310
Unfortunately, some people do
listen in on party lines. We...

25
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:28,006
Well, what is he doing?

26
00:04:31,318 --> 00:04:32,307
Oh, my...

27
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:33,716
Everything all right?

28
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:38,349
Yes, sir, it's fine. A lady was
having trouble with the connection.

29
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,149
Hey, sport.
Hey, Mom.

30
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:41,625
How was school?

31
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:42,923
Okay.
Yeah?

32
00:04:42,996 --> 00:04:44,964
We learned
about dinosaurs.

33
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:47,329
And I got in a fight
with Billy Mankowski.

34
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,458
What happened?

35
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:49,661
He hit me.

36
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:51,260
Did you hit him back?

37
00:04:51,338 --> 00:04:52,635
Good.

38
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:53,968
Rule number one,
remember?

39
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,736
Never start a fight,
always finish it.

40
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,968
Why'd he hit you?

41
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:00,342
Because I hit him.

42
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:02,705
You hit him first?

43
00:05:03,216 --> 00:05:04,240
Why?

44
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:08,886
He said my dad ran off
because he didn't like me.

45
00:05:08,955 --> 00:05:11,321
Honey, your father
never met you,

46
00:05:11,391 --> 00:05:13,325
so how could he
not like you?

47
00:05:13,393 --> 00:05:15,190
Then why did he leave?

48
00:05:16,763 --> 00:05:20,221
Well, because the day
you were born,

49
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,700
something else
arrived in the mail.

50
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:24,695
And it was in a box a
little bit bigger than you.

51
00:05:24,771 --> 00:05:26,398
You know what was in it?

52
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:28,236
Something called
responsibility.

53
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:30,299
And to some people,

54
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:33,141
responsibility is the
scariest thing in the world.

55
00:05:34,414 --> 00:05:38,578
So, he ran away because he was
scared of what was in that box?

56
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:39,676
Uh-huh.

57
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:41,084
That's just dumb.

58
00:05:41,154 --> 00:05:42,917
That is exactly
what I thought.

59
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:57,067
<i>Did I miss Amos 'N Andy?</i>

60
00:05:57,137 --> 00:05:59,037
I'm afraid so, sport.

61
00:05:59,572 --> 00:06:00,971
Come now, time for bed.

62
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:08,710
Are we still going
to the movies tomorrow?

63
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:12,047
Uh-huh. I hear there's a
new Charlie Chaplin picture

64
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:14,916
<i>and a new serial called
The Mysterious Airman.</i>

65
00:06:15,188 --> 00:06:16,382
Who's that?

66
00:06:16,456 --> 00:06:18,424
I don't know.
Nobody does.

67
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:20,652
That's what makes him
so mysterious.

68
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:21,716
Oh.

69
00:06:22,095 --> 00:06:24,222
Am I too heavy
for you to carry?

70
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:26,959
Oh, no,
not for years.

71
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:28,523
Not for years.

72
00:06:36,976 --> 00:06:38,568
<i>Hello?
This is Margaret.</i>

73
00:06:38,645 --> 00:06:39,805
Hi, Margaret.

74
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:40,868
<i>So, how are you?</i>

75
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:42,175
Fine.

76
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:44,512
<i>Listen, Jean can't come in today
and now we're a little shorthanded.</i>

77
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:45,812
When did she call in sick?

78
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:46,943
<i>About half hour ago.</i>

79
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,681
<i>I'm having a hard time
trying to find someone.</i>

80
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:50,484
Well, what about Myrna?

81
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:51,922
I know she could use
the extra hours and...

82
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:54,084
<i>She's busy.
Can't you come?</i>

83
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,922
No. No, no, no.
I just...

84
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:02,631
I promised Walter that I'd take
him to the movies, is all, and...

85
00:07:02,702 --> 00:07:04,101
<i>Well, it's just until 4:00.</i>

86
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,364
All right.

87
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:07,235
Just...
Just until 4:00.

88
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:09,305
I'll see you then.

89
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:17,473
There's a sandwich
and milk in the fridge,

90
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,074
and I've asked Mrs. Riley
and her daughter

91
00:07:19,152 --> 00:07:20,915
to stop in
in a couple of hours.

92
00:07:20,987 --> 00:07:23,148
I can take care of myself.

93
00:07:23,223 --> 00:07:25,851
I know you can. They're
checking on the house, not you.

94
00:07:34,134 --> 00:07:36,830
Tomorrow we will
go to the movies.

95
00:07:37,437 --> 00:07:41,874
And then we'll ride Big Red to Santa
Monica and take a walk on the pier.

96
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:44,171
How does that sound?
Does that sound good?

97
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:49,544
I'll be home
before it gets dark.

98
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:51,510
I'm not afraid
of the dark.

99
00:07:51,584 --> 00:07:53,381
I'm not afraid
of anything.

100
00:07:54,254 --> 00:07:57,018
I know.
I know.

101
00:07:59,592 --> 00:08:01,150
Be good.

102
00:08:01,327 --> 00:08:02,885
I love you.

103
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:40,699
We've got lines jammed
from here to Ohio.

104
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:43,201
He says he needs to speak
to somebody in charge.

105
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:46,931
I need your signature here
for a supply requisition.

106
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:49,031
Number, please.
Number, please.

107
00:08:49,943 --> 00:08:51,376
Go ahead, please.

108
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:55,443
All right, get me
the Omaha routing station.

109
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:57,915
See if we can put our calls
through their switchers.

110
00:08:57,984 --> 00:08:59,576
Let's get this
console running, now.

111
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,223
Christine. Good, I was
hoping to catch you.

112
00:09:07,627 --> 00:09:09,686
Look, I've been following
your work reports,

113
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:11,957
and I just want to let you
know that I am very impressed.

114
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:14,465
When I first suggested
hiring female supervisors,

115
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:16,092
my superiors weren't
big on the idea.

116
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:19,036
But you have held your own as well
as any of your male counterparts.

117
00:09:19,105 --> 00:09:20,129
Thank you, Mr. Harris.

118
00:09:20,206 --> 00:09:21,730
Oh, Ben, please.
Listen, I...

119
00:09:21,808 --> 00:09:22,900
Listen, the point is,

120
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:25,774
we're looking to take on a manager
for our new Beverly Hills office.

121
00:09:25,845 --> 00:09:28,871
And if you're interested in the
job, I could write a report, or...

122
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:30,745
That would be wonderful.
Thank you so much, sir.

123
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:33,081
Okay, good,
so maybe we could...

124
00:09:33,152 --> 00:09:34,619
Could we speak about it
Monday? Yeah, absolutely.

125
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:37,178
Would that be all right? Thank
you so much, sir. Thank you.

126
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:46,560
Please!

127
00:09:49,202 --> 00:09:50,464
Please.

128
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:23,566
Walter.

129
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:26,665
Honey?

130
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:30,007
Walter.

131
00:10:30,343 --> 00:10:31,571
Walter!

132
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:33,942
Honey?

133
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:50,523
Walter?

134
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,164
Honey!

135
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:02,605
Walter!

136
00:11:03,643 --> 00:11:06,237
Walter, it's time
to come in, honey.

137
00:11:09,482 --> 00:11:12,007
Suzie?
Have you seen Walter?

138
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:14,978
No, Mrs. Collins.

139
00:11:15,054 --> 00:11:16,248
Sorry.

140
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:27,057
Walter?

141
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:31,801
Walter.

142
00:11:55,962 --> 00:11:57,190
<i>Number, please.</i>

143
00:11:57,263 --> 00:11:59,288
May I please have
the police station?

144
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:00,889
<i>I'll connect you.</i>

145
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:01,956
<i>Lincoln Heights
Division.</i>

146
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:03,832
Hello, my name is
Christine Collins.

147
00:12:03,903 --> 00:12:06,428
I live at 210
North Avenue, 23.

148
00:12:06,939 --> 00:12:09,407
And I'm calling
to report a missing child.

149
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:10,942
Missing child.

150
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:14,070
<i>What's your relation
to the child, ma'am?</i>

151
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:15,546
It's my son.

152
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:17,842
<i>How long has he been gone?</i>

153
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:20,310
I'm not sure.
I just got home from work.

154
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:23,816
It could be
since this morning

155
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,619
or it could be
just the last hour.

156
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:26,749
<i>Have you checked
around the neighborhood?</i>

157
00:12:26,826 --> 00:12:28,555
Yes, of course I did.

158
00:12:28,628 --> 00:12:30,687
<i>Well, maybe
he's lost track of time.</i>

159
00:12:30,763 --> 00:12:32,025
No. No, no.

160
00:12:32,098 --> 00:12:35,534
He always stays around the
house when it gets dark.

161
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:37,660
Would you please send
someone down here?

162
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,135
<i>I'm sorry,
but our policy is that</i>

163
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:43,164
<i>we don't dispatch units on
missing child cases for 24 hours.</i>

164
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,502
What?

165
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:49,036
<i>Look, 99 times out of 100,
the kid shows up by morning.</i>

166
00:12:49,148 --> 00:12:53,016
<i>We don't have the resources to go chasing
every kid who runs off with his pals.</i>

167
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:54,178
No, no, no.

168
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:56,881
No, that's not Walter.
He doesn't do that.

169
00:12:56,956 --> 00:13:01,290
<i>With all due respect, ma'am, every
parent who calls says the same thing.</i>

170
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:04,387
Please, please.

171
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:06,125
<i>Look, there's
nothing I can do.</i>

172
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:07,666
<i>I'll take your name
and your information,</i>

173
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:10,361
<i>but that's all until the
morning, at the earliest.</i>

174
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:13,462
<i>I'm sure he'll show up
by then. They always do.</i>

175
00:13:41,934 --> 00:13:43,629
Are you Mrs. Collins?

176
00:13:58,384 --> 00:14:02,912
<i>Our thoughts go out again
today to Mrs. Christine Collins</i>

177
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:04,422
<i>of Lincoln Heights,</i>

178
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,651
<i>whose young son,
Walter Collins,</i>

179
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:09,251
<i>disappeared
nearly two weeks ago.</i>

180
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:13,787
<i>Though she is not a
member of our congregation,</i>

181
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:17,594
<i>we pray for her today
as we have every day,</i>

182
00:14:18,504 --> 00:14:20,904
<i>since we learned
of her plight.</i>

183
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:23,839
<i>On the radio and
in the newspapers</i>

184
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,845
<i>we are told that the Los
Angeles Police Department</i>

185
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:31,509
<i>is doing its very best to
reunite mother and child,</i>

186
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:33,984
<i>and I'm sure
that that is true.</i>

187
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:40,151
<i>But given its status as
the most violent, corrupt</i>

188
00:14:40,226 --> 00:14:42,194
<i>and incompetent
police department</i>

189
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:44,491
<i>this side
of the Rocky Mountains</i>

190
00:14:44,564 --> 00:14:48,022
<i>I am not sure
it's saying a great deal.</i>

191
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:59,007
<i>Every day, new bodies
appear along Mulholland</i>

192
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:01,103
<i>and in the ditches
of our cities,</i>

193
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:07,585
<i>the work of Police Chief James
Davis and his aptly named Gun Squad.</i>

194
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:11,020
<i>Every day, the needs
of honest citizens</i>

195
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:15,322
<i>are put second to greed
and personal gain.</i>

196
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:21,889
<i>Every day, this city sinks
deeper into a cesspool</i>

197
00:15:21,968 --> 00:15:26,769
<i>of fear, intimidation
and corruption.</i>

198
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:29,239
<i>Once the City of Angels,</i>

199
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:34,371
<i>Los Angeles has become
a place where our protectors</i>

200
00:15:34,447 --> 00:15:36,938
<i>have become
our brutalizers.</i>

201
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:41,980
<i>Where to be the law is
to be above the law.</i>

202
00:16:29,802 --> 00:16:31,360
I understand.
Thank you.

203
00:16:31,437 --> 00:16:33,234
I will call back
in a few weeks.

204
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:35,570
Thank you very much.

205
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:41,143
Las Vegas Missing
Persons Department?

206
00:16:41,681 --> 00:16:43,444
Hello, this is
Christine Collins.

207
00:16:43,516 --> 00:16:46,383
I'm calling to see if you've
found any missing or lost children

208
00:16:46,452 --> 00:16:50,320
who meet the description
that matches Walter Collins.

209
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:55,226
Oh, all right. Well,
please do. Please do call.

210
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:56,852
And I'll call back
in a matter...

211
00:16:56,929 --> 00:16:59,693
In a week, if that's all
right. Thank you very much.

212
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:00,754
Thank you.

213
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:17,677
$2.

214
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,658
Hell, I think I left
my wallet at home.

215
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:31,629
Can I owe it to you?

216
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:34,126
No credit.

217
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,861
Pay up or I
call the cops.

218
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:37,766
I'm sick of bums like you
coming around here.

219
00:17:37,837 --> 00:17:39,270
I'm not trying to
stiff you, chief.

220
00:17:39,338 --> 00:17:41,829
I just left my wallet
at home, that's all.

221
00:17:41,907 --> 00:17:44,876
I'll go back and get it.
Five, 10 minutes, tops.

222
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,841
Got collateral?

223
00:17:50,282 --> 00:17:51,681
You can't ask for
better collateral

224
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:54,049
than a man's own flesh
and blood, right?

225
00:17:55,087 --> 00:17:56,645
Now, you stay here, son.

226
00:17:56,889 --> 00:17:58,254
I'll be right back.

227
00:17:58,324 --> 00:18:00,849
But... Now, don't give me any trouble.

228
00:18:00,926 --> 00:18:02,917
He's a good man to
trust us like this.

229
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:07,563
Now, you just stay here and
I'll go back and get my wallet.

230
00:18:10,836 --> 00:18:13,270
Ten minutes,
then I call the cops.

231
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:24,939
Ah, hell.

232
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:31,513
<i>Number, please.
Hello, Myrtle?</i>

233
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,455
<i>Hello? Yeah, this is
Harve, down at the diner.</i>

234
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:34,584
<i>Oh, hi, Harve.</i>

235
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,820
Would you get me
Sheriff Larsen?

236
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:36,793
<i>Sure thing.</i>

237
00:18:38,597 --> 00:18:40,326
You have
a nice day, too.

238
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:45,830
Christine, I'm having trouble
with the connection here.

239
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:47,770
I can't seem
to get through.

240
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,240
I think so. Yeah, I think that's better.

241
00:18:53,646 --> 00:18:56,615
You have a person to
person call, Fairfax 2231.

242
00:18:56,682 --> 00:18:59,173
Long distance.
Sorry, can you repeat?

243
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:01,014
I'll connect you
right away, ma'am.

244
00:19:01,187 --> 00:19:02,449
Thanks.

245
00:19:16,035 --> 00:19:17,366
Mrs. Collins?

246
00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:18,760
Yes.

247
00:19:19,638 --> 00:19:22,539
I'm Captain J.J. Jones,
Lincoln Park Juvenile Division.

248
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:27,138
My office supervises all
runaway and missing child cases,

249
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:29,078
including your son's,
and...

250
00:19:29,882 --> 00:19:31,747
He's alive,
Mrs. Collins.

251
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:38,555
He was picked up two days ago by
local police in DeKalb, Illinois.

252
00:19:38,624 --> 00:19:40,057
He's safe and unhurt.

253
00:19:42,962 --> 00:19:45,556
He was in the company of some
drifter. We have an APB out for him,

254
00:19:45,631 --> 00:19:46,655
but he's safe.

255
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:50,667
Thank you so much.

256
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,931
Oh, Christine...

257
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,237
That is so great.

258
00:20:04,183 --> 00:20:05,275
Thank you.

259
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:23,926
There's
so much press.

260
00:20:24,603 --> 00:20:27,003
Yours is a story with a
happy ending, Mrs. Collins.

261
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:29,267
People love happy endings.

262
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:32,705
We better get a move on,
the train's pulling in.

263
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,214
Back, boys. Back.

264
00:20:36,515 --> 00:20:38,346
Thanks.
Thanks, boys, thanks!

265
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:39,907
I'll have a statement
for you in a few minutes,

266
00:20:39,985 --> 00:20:41,043
but the important
thing right now

267
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,883
is to reunite this
little lady with her son,

268
00:20:42,955 --> 00:20:44,320
so if you'll excuse us.

269
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:49,588
Stay right there.
Come on, don't rush.

270
00:20:50,496 --> 00:20:51,758
Easy, easy.

271
00:20:53,699 --> 00:20:56,224
Mrs. Collins, I'd like to
introduce you to James E. Davis,

272
00:20:56,302 --> 00:20:57,496
Chief of Police.

273
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,559
Very nice to meet you.

274
00:20:58,637 --> 00:21:00,002
We don't get a lot
of positive attention

275
00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:01,562
from the boys in the
press these days,

276
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,131
so it's good to be here with a
positive story, don't you think?

277
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:05,267
Yes, sir.

278
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:09,713
I take it you've been treated
well by my boys in the department?

279
00:21:09,782 --> 00:21:11,875
I couldn't file a report for 24 hours,

280
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:13,213
and I thought that
maybe that was a...

281
00:21:13,285 --> 00:21:14,718
Technicalities aside.

282
00:21:16,755 --> 00:21:17,915
It was wonderful.

283
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,116
Well, good.

284
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,060
Then you won't have any trouble
telling that to the press,

285
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:25,062
and the fact that the LAPD...

286
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:29,426
Women.

287
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:30,661
Hold on a second.

288
00:21:38,777 --> 00:21:40,335
Back, boys, back.

289
00:21:42,348 --> 00:21:43,576
Keep them back.

290
00:22:03,068 --> 00:22:06,060
Well, aren't you...
Aren't you gonna...

291
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:07,400
That's not my son.

292
00:22:10,676 --> 00:22:11,836
What?

293
00:22:13,078 --> 00:22:14,409
What are you saying?

294
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,477
It's not my son.

295
00:22:16,548 --> 00:22:18,914
Well, I'm sure
you're mistaken.

296
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:20,076
I'm not mistaken.

297
00:22:20,152 --> 00:22:22,780
Well, he's been through
five terrible long months.

298
00:22:22,855 --> 00:22:24,982
He's lost weight,
he's changed.

299
00:22:25,057 --> 00:22:26,752
I would know my own son.

300
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:29,623
All I'm saying is you're
in shock and he's changed.

301
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:33,158
What's your name? Can
you tell me your name?

302
00:22:33,232 --> 00:22:34,859
Walter Collins.

303
00:22:37,102 --> 00:22:38,592
It's a common name.

304
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:40,832
Where do you live, Walter?
You know your home address?

305
00:22:40,906 --> 00:22:44,137
I live at 210 Avenue 23,

306
00:22:44,476 --> 00:22:46,467
Los Angeles, California.

307
00:22:46,545 --> 00:22:48,445
And that's my mommy!

308
00:22:53,218 --> 00:22:56,585
Mrs. Collins, listen
to me. I understand.

309
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:59,647
You're feeling a little uncertain
right now, and that's to be expected.

310
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:02,091
A boy this age,
he changes so fast.

311
00:23:02,628 --> 00:23:05,096
We've compensated for that
in our investigation.

312
00:23:05,164 --> 00:23:08,133
And there's no question
that this is your son.

313
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,225
That is not Walter.

314
00:23:12,438 --> 00:23:14,406
It's not Walter
as you remember him.

315
00:23:14,907 --> 00:23:19,105
And that's why it's important for
you to take him home on a trial basis.

316
00:23:20,546 --> 00:23:22,070
A trial basis?

317
00:23:22,147 --> 00:23:23,205
Yes, yes.

318
00:23:23,282 --> 00:23:26,809
Once he's around his
familiar surroundings,

319
00:23:26,885 --> 00:23:30,821
and you've given yourself time to recover
from the shock of his changed condition,

320
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:33,653
you will see that
this is your Walter.

321
00:23:33,726 --> 00:23:36,286
Now, I promise you, I swear
to you, I give you my word.

322
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:37,988
This is your son.

323
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:41,624
Now, if you have any problems, any problems
at all, you come and you talk to me.

324
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,031
I'll take care of it.

325
00:23:44,703 --> 00:23:47,035
I give you my word.
Trust me.

326
00:23:47,606 --> 00:23:51,098
Mrs. Collins, he has
nowhere else to go.

327
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:56,075
Please.

328
00:24:00,686 --> 00:24:03,211
Maybe I'm not
thinking clearly.

329
00:24:03,288 --> 00:24:05,119
And...

330
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:07,718
All right.

331
00:24:07,793 --> 00:24:10,318
All right, you're not
thinking clearly, that's right.

332
00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:11,828
Here we go!

333
00:24:12,331 --> 00:24:13,662
Thank you.
Thank you.

334
00:24:13,732 --> 00:24:15,791
Here, just turn
around here.

335
00:24:16,235 --> 00:24:17,930
How does it feel to have
your son home, Mrs. Collins?

336
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:19,994
What'd you think when you
saw him for the first time?

337
00:24:20,072 --> 00:24:22,370
It's hard to explain.

338
00:24:22,441 --> 00:24:24,272
She was
shocked at first.

339
00:24:24,343 --> 00:24:27,312
She didn't recognize the boy,
which is perfectly natural.

340
00:24:27,379 --> 00:24:28,744
He's been through
quite an ordeal.

341
00:24:28,814 --> 00:24:30,281
How're you feeling, son?

342
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:31,407
Bet it feels great
to be home.

343
00:24:31,483 --> 00:24:32,780
Yeah. It's great.

344
00:24:32,851 --> 00:24:35,012
The Los Angeles Police
Department is thankful

345
00:24:35,087 --> 00:24:38,284
for all the hard work done by the
DeKalb County Sheriff's Department

346
00:24:38,357 --> 00:24:40,985
in making this joyful
reunion possible.

347
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:43,755
The LAPD is dedicated to
serving the public at all times.

348
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:46,457
Can we get a photo with
mother and son, Captain?

349
00:24:46,532 --> 00:24:48,727
Absolutely! Here we are.

350
00:24:48,934 --> 00:24:50,561
Like that.
Like that.

351
00:24:50,636 --> 00:24:53,196
Squeeze together.
There you go, boys.

352
00:24:54,072 --> 00:24:55,835
This way, Walter.
Big smile.

353
00:24:56,308 --> 00:24:57,969
One more, please.
That's a good one.

354
00:24:59,111 --> 00:25:00,305
One more.

355
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,299
The sandwich all right?

356
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:27,303
Would you like
some more milk?

357
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:28,498
No.

358
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,137
No, thank you.

359
00:25:31,643 --> 00:25:32,871
No, thank you.

360
00:25:39,284 --> 00:25:43,311
You're covered in soot from the
train. You should take a bath.

361
00:25:54,566 --> 00:25:57,194
Pajamas are on the
edge of the bed.

362
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:01,900
You okay?
You all right?

363
00:26:01,974 --> 00:26:03,942
I fell. Stupid tub!

364
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:06,439
That's all right.

365
00:26:09,114 --> 00:26:10,911
You're circumcised.

366
00:26:16,355 --> 00:26:17,686
Get out.

367
00:26:19,024 --> 00:26:20,218
Move.

368
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:33,228
Last time
I measured Walter,

369
00:26:33,305 --> 00:26:35,569
last time
I measured my son,

370
00:26:35,641 --> 00:26:37,700
he was inches taller
than you are now.

371
00:26:38,644 --> 00:26:40,077
Who are you?

372
00:26:41,246 --> 00:26:43,305
What are you doing here?

373
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:45,939
Who are you?

374
00:26:47,219 --> 00:26:48,413
Who are you?

375
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,064
He's not my son.

376
00:27:03,135 --> 00:27:04,193
Mrs. Collins...

377
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:06,396
No, I don't know why
he's saying that he is,

378
00:27:06,471 --> 00:27:08,200
but he's not Walter
and there's been a mistake.

379
00:27:08,273 --> 00:27:10,298
I thought we agreed to
give him time to adjust.

380
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:12,036
He's three inches shorter.

381
00:27:12,411 --> 00:27:13,742
I measured him
on the chart.

382
00:27:13,812 --> 00:27:15,211
Well, maybe your
measurements are off.

383
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,215
Look, I'm sure there's a reasonable
explanation for all of this.

384
00:27:18,283 --> 00:27:19,614
He's circumcised.

385
00:27:20,252 --> 00:27:21,583
And Walter isn't.

386
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:24,150
Mrs. Collins.

387
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,791
Your son was missing
for five months.

388
00:27:29,861 --> 00:27:34,423
For at least part of that time in the
company of an as yet unidentified drifter.

389
00:27:34,499 --> 00:27:37,332
Who knows what such a disturbed
individual might have done?

390
00:27:38,103 --> 00:27:41,197
He could have had him
circumcised. He could have...

391
00:27:41,273 --> 00:27:42,740
Made him shorter?

392
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,044
Why aren't you
listening to me?

393
00:27:49,114 --> 00:27:52,106
I am listening, damn it, I am listening.

394
00:27:52,184 --> 00:27:53,708
And I understand
your feelings.

395
00:27:53,785 --> 00:27:55,912
He's changed, no mistake, and that's...

396
00:27:55,988 --> 00:27:57,615
You've both been through
a terrible experience,

397
00:27:57,689 --> 00:28:00,590
and that's why he needs your
love and support to bounce back.

398
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:02,182
He's not my son!

399
00:28:03,328 --> 00:28:05,455
Why are you doing this,
Mrs. Collins?

400
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,622
Why are you doing this?

401
00:28:06,698 --> 00:28:09,758
You seem perfectly capable
of taking care of the boy.

402
00:28:09,835 --> 00:28:12,235
Your job pays you enough to
attend to his personal needs,

403
00:28:12,304 --> 00:28:14,033
so I don't understand
why you're running away

404
00:28:14,106 --> 00:28:15,903
from your responsibilities
as a mother.

405
00:28:15,974 --> 00:28:18,238
I am not running away
from anything!

406
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,777
Least of all
my responsibilities!

407
00:28:19,845 --> 00:28:22,439
I am even taking care
of that boy right now,

408
00:28:22,514 --> 00:28:24,345
because I am all he has!

409
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:26,714
What worries me is that you
have stopped looking for my son!

410
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:31,279
Why should we be looking for
someone we've already found?

411
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,784
Because you have
not found him.

412
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,294
His identity
has been confirmed

413
00:28:37,362 --> 00:28:40,854
by the best minds in the
field of child identification,

414
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:43,130
people who know
what they're doing.

415
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:44,600
And I don't?

416
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,053
I'm sorry.

417
00:29:06,024 --> 00:29:08,049
I appreciate everything that
this department has done

418
00:29:08,126 --> 00:29:10,253
and I know
how hard you're working.

419
00:29:10,328 --> 00:29:13,422
I really do, and I don't
want to cause any trouble.

420
00:29:13,498 --> 00:29:16,262
I just... There has
been a terrible mistake,

421
00:29:16,334 --> 00:29:18,495
and I need you to
help me correct it,

422
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:23,405
so I can find my son
before it's too late.

423
00:29:25,677 --> 00:29:26,803
Please.

424
00:29:35,854 --> 00:29:39,517
I won't take up any more of
your time. I'm sorry I got upset.

425
00:29:39,591 --> 00:29:41,525
I'm sorry, very sorry.

426
00:29:54,206 --> 00:29:55,195
<i>Yes, Captain?</i>

427
00:29:55,273 --> 00:29:57,264
Sara, get Dr. Tarr
on the phone.

428
00:29:57,342 --> 00:29:58,468
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

429
00:30:03,782 --> 00:30:04,806
Mrs. Collins?
Yes?

430
00:30:04,883 --> 00:30:06,510
Dr. Earl W. Tarr.

431
00:30:06,585 --> 00:30:07,609
Captain Jones sent me.

432
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:10,120
I consult with him from time
to time on juvenile cases.

433
00:30:10,188 --> 00:30:11,553
May I come in?

434
00:30:11,857 --> 00:30:13,791
Yes, thank you for coming.

435
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:15,656
I was beginning to think
he didn't believe me.

436
00:30:15,727 --> 00:30:19,094
Well, I'm here now, and
we'll put all that to rights.

437
00:30:20,365 --> 00:30:21,923
Where's the boy?

438
00:30:24,703 --> 00:30:26,694
Ah! There he is.

439
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:29,700
A handsome young man.

440
00:30:30,408 --> 00:30:32,239
He has your eyes,
doesn't he?

441
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,540
And a little bit
of the nose.

442
00:30:34,813 --> 00:30:37,941
Very fit, in spite
of all his travails.

443
00:30:38,016 --> 00:30:41,315
A very resilient boy you've
got here, Mrs. Collins.

444
00:30:42,287 --> 00:30:43,948
I thought you were
here to help me.

445
00:30:44,022 --> 00:30:45,512
Well, I am.

446
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:49,026
Captain Jones said that the boy had
been through some severe physical changes

447
00:30:49,094 --> 00:30:50,618
and asked me
to drop in on him

448
00:30:50,695 --> 00:30:53,289
to reassure you in your
time of motherly concern.

449
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:58,759
My motherly concern is not for
him because he's not my son.

450
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:03,999
Now, statements like that will
hardly help the boy's self-esteem,

451
00:31:04,075 --> 00:31:05,474
now will they?

452
00:31:06,745 --> 00:31:09,475
Captain Jones said something
about a change in height?

453
00:31:10,348 --> 00:31:11,406
Yes.

454
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:13,848
Come.

455
00:31:15,987 --> 00:31:17,318
Against the wall.

456
00:31:21,193 --> 00:31:22,717
He's
three inches shorter.

457
00:31:23,495 --> 00:31:25,258
Ah, well...

458
00:31:26,231 --> 00:31:29,860
Hardly a mystery,
Mrs. Collins.

459
00:31:29,935 --> 00:31:34,235
We've known for some time that trauma
can affect the growth of children.

460
00:31:34,306 --> 00:31:36,467
Given the stress
of the past five months,

461
00:31:36,908 --> 00:31:39,001
his spine may have
actually shrunk.

462
00:31:39,077 --> 00:31:42,046
It's uncommon, but it's within
the realm of possibility.

463
00:31:44,716 --> 00:31:46,081
And circumcision?

464
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:53,350
Very likely his abductor
thought it appropriate.

465
00:31:53,425 --> 00:31:56,189
After all, circumcision
is hygienically sound.

466
00:31:57,596 --> 00:32:00,565
Must have been quite
traumatic at the time.

467
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:04,595
No wonder
he's submerged the memory.

468
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:08,062
I...

469
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:12,473
You see, there's a perfectly sound
medical explanation for all of this.

470
00:32:13,645 --> 00:32:15,909
But it's right for you
to raise the questions.

471
00:32:15,981 --> 00:32:19,007
You need to be apprised of all
changes the lad went through

472
00:32:19,084 --> 00:32:21,143
during his absence.

473
00:32:21,219 --> 00:32:24,484
Wouldn't I know whether
or not he's my son?

474
00:32:25,423 --> 00:32:26,947
I'm the mother.

475
00:32:27,492 --> 00:32:29,983
Which means you're in no
position to be objective.

476
00:32:30,862 --> 00:32:34,958
You are looking through the
prism of extreme emotion at a boy

477
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:37,631
who has changed
from what you remember.

478
00:32:37,702 --> 00:32:39,727
He isn't the same boy
that left here.

479
00:32:39,804 --> 00:32:41,931
Just as a boy that goes
off to war and then returns

480
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:43,838
is not the same anymore.

481
00:32:43,908 --> 00:32:48,572
And a mother's heart, driven
by intuition and emotion,

482
00:32:48,647 --> 00:32:51,081
sees these changes
and rebels,

483
00:32:51,783 --> 00:32:54,115
insists that
this isn't your son.

484
00:32:55,787 --> 00:32:57,516
Doesn't change the facts.

485
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:05,592
I'm willing to put my theory to the
test of objectivity, Mrs. Collins.

486
00:33:06,431 --> 00:33:07,796
Are you?

487
00:33:15,073 --> 00:33:17,200
<i>It is
absolutely outrageous!</i>

488
00:33:17,275 --> 00:33:20,176
Calm yourself, calm yourself
and just listen to me.

489
00:33:20,245 --> 00:33:24,306
No, no, no.
No, you listen to me, please.

490
00:33:24,983 --> 00:33:28,851
This so called doctor paraded
me around my own neighborhood,

491
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,253
like some kind of a derelict mother
who didn't even know her own son.

492
00:33:32,324 --> 00:33:34,315
<i>And what
was his findings?</i>

493
00:33:34,392 --> 00:33:36,656
He found what he
expected to find,

494
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:40,330
what you obviously
told him he would find.

495
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:41,865
<i>Mrs. Collins.
But that's not...</i>

496
00:33:41,933 --> 00:33:43,594
That's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

497
00:33:43,668 --> 00:33:48,162
That I was embarrassed
is not the issue.

498
00:33:50,308 --> 00:33:53,277
The point is that
you are wasting time

499
00:33:53,345 --> 00:33:56,508
when you should be
looking for my son.

500
00:33:56,581 --> 00:33:59,641
But the report is final,
Mrs. Collins.

501
00:34:00,618 --> 00:34:03,815
Well, then I want to receive
the report, so I can refute it,

502
00:34:03,888 --> 00:34:05,822
before it goes
to anyone else.

503
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,118
Fine.

504
00:34:08,026 --> 00:34:10,290
Yes. Good day.

505
00:34:18,703 --> 00:34:21,069
I'm finished. Could I
go to my room now?

506
00:34:23,007 --> 00:34:24,167
Yes.

507
00:34:33,718 --> 00:34:35,379
Good night, Mommy.

508
00:34:36,821 --> 00:34:39,119
Stop saying that!

509
00:34:40,558 --> 00:34:42,651
Stop saying that!

510
00:34:42,927 --> 00:34:44,827
I'm not your mother!

511
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:50,460
I want my son back.

512
00:34:50,535 --> 00:34:54,164
You're not him.
You're not my son!

513
00:34:57,142 --> 00:34:59,235
I want my son back.

514
00:35:00,145 --> 00:35:02,670
I want my son back!

515
00:35:03,214 --> 00:35:04,579
Damn you!

516
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,118
I want my son back!

517
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:43,549
I was wrong
to yell at you.

518
00:35:46,691 --> 00:35:48,283
You're just a child

519
00:35:49,794 --> 00:35:52,558
and I don't think you know
what you're doing,

520
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,621
and the hurt
you're causing.

521
00:35:54,699 --> 00:36:00,137
But I need you to understand
that my son is my life.

522
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,401
He's all I have.

523
00:36:06,544 --> 00:36:10,742
And no matter what the police think,
and no matter what the world thinks,

524
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:14,147
you and I,

525
00:36:15,253 --> 00:36:18,245
we both know the truth,
don't we?

526
00:36:18,556 --> 00:36:22,822
We both know that
you're not Walter.

527
00:36:22,894 --> 00:36:26,887
You just have to tell them
that you're not my son,

528
00:36:26,965 --> 00:36:28,933
so they can find my son.

529
00:36:32,504 --> 00:36:33,766
Please.

530
00:36:40,345 --> 00:36:43,246
We can talk tomorrow.

531
00:37:05,136 --> 00:37:06,228
Hello?

532
00:37:06,304 --> 00:37:08,329
<i>Is this
Mrs. Christine Collins?</i>

533
00:37:08,406 --> 00:37:09,964
Yes.

534
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:11,633
My name is Gustav Briegleb.

535
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:15,076
I'm the pastor over at
St. Paul's Presbyterian.

536
00:37:16,414 --> 00:37:18,382
Oh, yes, I've heard
your broadcasts.

537
00:37:18,449 --> 00:37:19,973
I'm...

538
00:37:20,051 --> 00:37:21,951
Thank you.

539
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,580
<i>Have you read
the Times this morning?</i>

540
00:37:24,656 --> 00:37:25,782
No.

541
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:30,489
<i>Well, maybe you should give it a gander
and then come over here to the parish</i>

542
00:37:30,562 --> 00:37:33,622
for breakfast, in, say, an
hour. I think we should meet.

543
00:37:36,301 --> 00:37:37,461
Hello?

544
00:37:45,443 --> 00:37:47,468
"Mysterious case of...

545
00:37:47,545 --> 00:37:49,911
"Acting on the request of the
Los Angeles Police Department,

546
00:37:49,981 --> 00:37:54,145
"Dr. Earl W. Tarr, child
specialist, examined Walter Collins

547
00:37:54,218 --> 00:37:56,015
"to determine the cause
of his loss of weight,

548
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:58,749
"paleness, confusion,
and rundown condition

549
00:37:58,823 --> 00:38:00,017
"noticed since the
return of the boy

550
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:02,582
"To his mother last Monday. "

551
00:38:04,162 --> 00:38:06,392
Lovely bit of phrasing,
isn't it?

552
00:38:06,464 --> 00:38:09,490
Noticed since the return
of the boy to his mother.

553
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:12,331
Now, not only does that clearly
state you're the boy's mother,

554
00:38:12,403 --> 00:38:16,772
but one could infer from it that you're
somehow responsible for these changes.

555
00:38:16,841 --> 00:38:19,139
And that the police
department is concerned

556
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:21,974
for the boy's welfare
while he's in your charge.

557
00:38:22,046 --> 00:38:24,537
You should try the eggs.
They're very nice.

558
00:38:25,216 --> 00:38:28,811
"'I examined the boy quite
thoroughly,' Dr. Tarr said,

559
00:38:28,886 --> 00:38:31,354
"'And it's clear that
he has something to tell.

560
00:38:31,422 --> 00:38:32,821
"'I'm sure that in time... "'

561
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:37,020
...time he will give his boyish
story of the entire affair,

562
00:38:37,095 --> 00:38:39,893
but not until he has
faith in his listener.

563
00:38:39,964 --> 00:38:43,957
And that is what is lacking here,
faith in the poor lad's story.

564
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:48,194
Course of my examination, I found
nothing to dispute the findings

565
00:38:48,272 --> 00:38:50,069
of the LAPD.

566
00:38:51,376 --> 00:38:53,503
Why would they do this?

567
00:38:53,578 --> 00:38:56,570
To avoid admitting
they made a mistake

568
00:38:56,648 --> 00:38:58,309
when they brought
back the wrong boy.

569
00:38:58,383 --> 00:39:01,045
Of course, anyone reading the
newspaper with half a brain

570
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,178
would see
through it instantly.

571
00:39:03,254 --> 00:39:07,247
<i>Sadly, that would exclude about
half the readership of the Times.</i>

572
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:12,357
Mrs. Collins, I have made it my mission
in life to bring to light all the things

573
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,991
the LAPD wish none
of us ever knew about.

574
00:39:16,067 --> 00:39:22,097
A department ruled by violence, abuse,
murder, corruption and intimidation.

575
00:39:23,307 --> 00:39:26,640
When Chief Davis took over the
force two years ago, he said...

576
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:30,078
We will hold court against gunmen
in the streets of Los Angeles.

577
00:39:30,148 --> 00:39:33,083
I want them brought
in dead, not alive,

578
00:39:33,151 --> 00:39:36,985
and I will reprimand any officer who
shows the least mercy to a criminal.

579
00:39:37,088 --> 00:39:40,524
He picked 50 of the most
violent cops on the force,

580
00:39:40,591 --> 00:39:44,152
gave them machine guns and permission
to shoot anyone who got in their way.

581
00:39:44,228 --> 00:39:46,719
He called them
the Gun Squad.

582
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:52,102
<i>No lawyers, no trials, no questions,
no suspensions, no investigations.</i>

583
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,035
Just piles of bodies.

584
00:39:54,906 --> 00:39:59,002
<i>Bodies in the morgues, bodies in the
hospitals, bodies by the side of the road.</i>

585
00:39:59,077 --> 00:40:03,480
And not because the LAPD
wanted to wipe out crime. No.

586
00:40:03,548 --> 00:40:07,109
The LAPD wanted to
wipe out the competition.

587
00:40:07,185 --> 00:40:09,210
Mayor Cryer and half
the force are on the take.

588
00:40:09,287 --> 00:40:12,415
<i>Gambling, prostitution,
bootlegging, you name it.</i>

589
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:15,755
<i>Because once you give people the
freedom to do whatever they want,</i>

590
00:40:15,827 --> 00:40:20,628
as the Lord found in the Garden
of Eden, they will do exactly that.

591
00:40:20,732 --> 00:40:24,532
This police department does not
tolerate dissent, or contradiction,

592
00:40:24,602 --> 00:40:27,002
or even embarrassment.

593
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:31,838
And you are in a position to
embarrass them and they do not like it.

594
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:34,776
They will do anything in
their power to discredit you.

595
00:40:34,846 --> 00:40:38,441
I've seen that happen too many
times to start going blind now.

596
00:40:38,516 --> 00:40:40,575
That's why I wanted
to meet you,

597
00:40:40,651 --> 00:40:43,484
to let you know what
you're getting yourself into

598
00:40:43,554 --> 00:40:47,012
and to help you fight it,
if you choose to.

599
00:40:47,091 --> 00:40:49,491
Reverend, I appreciate
everything that you're doing

600
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,961
and everything
that you said,

601
00:40:53,865 --> 00:40:55,924
but I'm not on a mission.

602
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,025
I just want my son home.

603
00:41:00,004 --> 00:41:02,302
Mrs. Collins, a lot
of mothers' sons

604
00:41:02,373 --> 00:41:05,536
have been sacrificed
to expediency around here.

605
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,908
Your son, unfortunately,
would not be the first.

606
00:41:07,979 --> 00:41:11,346
But if you do it right,
he may very well be the last.

607
00:41:19,323 --> 00:41:21,655
He had two cavities
that needed filling.

608
00:41:21,726 --> 00:41:24,388
He put up a fight,
but I took care of it.

609
00:41:24,462 --> 00:41:25,724
And?

610
00:41:25,797 --> 00:41:29,460
Your son's upper front teeth were
separated by a small tissue, a diastema.

611
00:41:29,534 --> 00:41:32,025
It made them sit about
an eighth of an inch apart.

612
00:41:32,103 --> 00:41:34,537
The boy in that room
has no such gap.

613
00:41:34,605 --> 00:41:36,869
Can that change with age? Because
that's what they're gonna say.

614
00:41:36,941 --> 00:41:38,374
In some cases,
yes, it's possible.

615
00:41:38,442 --> 00:41:41,741
But the tissue between Walter's
teeth prevents that from happening.

616
00:41:41,813 --> 00:41:45,180
See, they can never come together
without an operation to sever the tissue,

617
00:41:45,249 --> 00:41:48,946
and I can tell you right now that
he has never had such an operation.

618
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:52,389
Would you be willing to put
that officially in writing?

619
00:41:52,456 --> 00:41:55,220
Pardon my language,
but hell yes.

620
00:41:56,861 --> 00:42:00,126
Sounds like the
anesthetic's wearing off.

621
00:42:00,198 --> 00:42:03,565
On the other hand, maybe
I'll write that letter first.

622
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:06,694
Give the little fella
something to think about.

623
00:42:16,781 --> 00:42:18,578
Well, if it is,
he's changed enormously.

624
00:42:18,649 --> 00:42:20,549
Do you know who I am?

625
00:42:20,618 --> 00:42:21,915
You're a teacher.

626
00:42:21,986 --> 00:42:25,149
Yes, but even teachers
have names. What's mine?

627
00:42:26,023 --> 00:42:27,854
I don't remember.

628
00:42:27,925 --> 00:42:30,758
I know you, but I don't
remember your name.

629
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:34,395
Mrs. Fox.
Now, take your seat.

630
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,473
I didn't say take a seat. I said
take your seat, the one assigned you.

631
00:42:53,551 --> 00:42:58,215
You must know where it is, you've
been sitting in it for over a year now.

632
00:43:06,397 --> 00:43:09,992
Mrs. Collins, if that's your
son, I'll eat my yardstick.

633
00:43:10,067 --> 00:43:13,468
Not only will I put it in writing, I
will testify to it in a court of law

634
00:43:13,537 --> 00:43:17,268
or to the President Calvin
Coolidge himself if I have to.

635
00:43:18,476 --> 00:43:19,568
Thank you.

636
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,473
I'll see you tonight
for the broadcast.

637
00:43:24,548 --> 00:43:25,879
Good luck.

638
00:43:35,126 --> 00:43:36,354
Quick question, ma'am.

639
00:43:36,427 --> 00:43:37,621
Quick question!

640
00:43:37,695 --> 00:43:39,424
Mrs. Collins.

641
00:43:40,665 --> 00:43:42,758
Hello. My name is
Christine Collins.

642
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:45,028
Good morning.
Good morning.

643
00:43:45,102 --> 00:43:49,664
On March 10th, my nine-year-old
son, Walter Collins, disappeared.

644
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,469
And a five-month investigation

645
00:43:51,542 --> 00:43:55,501
led to a boy being brought to
Los Angeles from DeKalb, Illinois.

646
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,947
They told me and all of you
that this boy was my son.

647
00:44:00,051 --> 00:44:01,882
He was not my son.

648
00:44:01,953 --> 00:44:03,887
The LAPD made a mistake,

649
00:44:03,955 --> 00:44:07,652
and that is the reason for
the supposed transformation.

650
00:44:08,259 --> 00:44:10,193
I have letters from his
teachers and his doctors

651
00:44:10,261 --> 00:44:12,661
all confirming that
he is not my son.

652
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:16,860
I'm having them reprinted now, and
I'll have them for you tomorrow.

653
00:44:16,934 --> 00:44:20,392
I have given the LAPD every
opportunity to admit their mistake

654
00:44:20,471 --> 00:44:22,735
and renew the
search for my son.

655
00:44:22,807 --> 00:44:24,707
Since they have
refused to do so,

656
00:44:24,775 --> 00:44:27,676
it has forced me
to bring my case public.

657
00:44:27,745 --> 00:44:31,442
And I hope that this now will persuade
them to finish what they started

658
00:44:31,515 --> 00:44:34,177
and bring my son home to me.

659
00:44:34,251 --> 00:44:35,741
Thank you very much.

660
00:44:48,899 --> 00:44:50,127
Morelli!

661
00:44:50,735 --> 00:44:53,101
I want you to find the
Collins woman and get her here.

662
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:55,400
And, Bill, bring her
in the back way.

663
00:44:55,473 --> 00:44:56,531
Yes, sir.

664
00:45:07,518 --> 00:45:09,042
This way, miss.

665
00:45:10,087 --> 00:45:11,145
Why are we going
in the back?

666
00:45:11,222 --> 00:45:13,986
Captain's orders. Front's
jammed with reporters.

667
00:45:18,929 --> 00:45:21,625
Please, sit down, miss. Captain
Jones'll be right with you.

668
00:45:21,699 --> 00:45:25,999
Hey! Anyone want to take a call
from the Canadian Mounties? Ybarra?

669
00:45:26,103 --> 00:45:27,365
What'd they do,
lose a moose?

670
00:45:27,438 --> 00:45:30,669
They need a juvenile living here
illegally deported back to Canada.

671
00:45:30,741 --> 00:45:34,142
He's living with his cousin on some
ranch near Riverside, in Wineville.

672
00:45:34,211 --> 00:45:35,269
You want it?
I'll take it.

673
00:45:35,346 --> 00:45:36,404
Got nothing better to do.

674
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,913
You're a prince.

675
00:45:40,384 --> 00:45:41,817
Mrs. Collins.

676
00:45:41,886 --> 00:45:45,083
You can leave the boy.
She'll take care of him.

677
00:45:50,261 --> 00:45:51,489
Sit.

678
00:45:52,096 --> 00:45:54,963
Oh, you've caused us quite a
bit of trouble, Mrs. Collins.

679
00:45:55,032 --> 00:45:58,058
This situation has become an embarrassment
for the entire police department.

680
00:45:58,135 --> 00:45:59,659
It wasn't my intention
to embarrass anyone.

681
00:45:59,737 --> 00:46:01,204
Oh, no, of course not.

682
00:46:01,272 --> 00:46:04,969
You just told the papers we couldn't
tell one boy from another as a compliment

683
00:46:05,042 --> 00:46:07,237
for the months we spent
working on your case.

684
00:46:07,311 --> 00:46:09,677
You trying to make fools out of
us? Is that it? You enjoy this?

685
00:46:09,747 --> 00:46:11,874
Of course not.

686
00:46:11,949 --> 00:46:13,177
I want you to find my son.

687
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,013
You know what your
problem is, Mrs. Collins?

688
00:46:15,086 --> 00:46:17,020
You're trying to shirk your
responsibilities as a mother.

689
00:46:17,088 --> 00:46:18,248
What?

690
00:46:18,322 --> 00:46:20,381
You enjoyed being a
free woman, didn't you?

691
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:22,517
You enjoyed not having to
worry about a young son.

692
00:46:22,593 --> 00:46:25,118
You could go where you
wanted, do whatever you wanted,

693
00:46:25,196 --> 00:46:26,993
see anyone you wanted.

694
00:46:27,064 --> 00:46:29,555
But then we found your son,
and we brought him back.

695
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:31,863
And now he's an
inconvenience to you.

696
00:46:31,936 --> 00:46:34,734
And that's why you
cooked up this scheme,

697
00:46:34,805 --> 00:46:37,638
to throw him to the state and get
the state to raise him for you.

698
00:46:37,708 --> 00:46:39,471
Isn't that true?
That is not true!

699
00:46:39,543 --> 00:46:41,875
No? Well, even the boy
says he's your son.

700
00:46:41,946 --> 00:46:43,243
Why would he say that?

701
00:46:43,314 --> 00:46:44,975
How would he know
to do that?

702
00:46:45,049 --> 00:46:47,017
I don't know.
I just know he's lying.

703
00:46:47,084 --> 00:46:49,450
Oh, maybe so.
Maybe he is a liar.

704
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,784
But that's how he's
been trained, isn't it?

705
00:46:51,856 --> 00:46:53,721
Lying was born
in both of you.

706
00:46:53,791 --> 00:46:55,816
You're a liar and a
troublemaker and, if you ask me,

707
00:46:55,893 --> 00:46:57,884
you got no business walking
the streets of Los Angeles.

708
00:46:57,962 --> 00:46:59,020
Now wait a minute.

709
00:46:59,096 --> 00:47:00,961
Because either
you know you're lying,

710
00:47:01,031 --> 00:47:04,762
or you're not capable of knowing if
you're lying or telling the truth.

711
00:47:04,835 --> 00:47:06,359
So, which is it?

712
00:47:07,771 --> 00:47:10,331
You a derelict mother?
Or just plain nuts?

713
00:47:10,407 --> 00:47:12,602
'Cause from where I sit,
those are the only options.

714
00:47:12,676 --> 00:47:14,007
I'm not gonna sit
here and take this.

715
00:47:14,078 --> 00:47:16,342
You want experts? You want
doctors? I have a few of my own.

716
00:47:16,413 --> 00:47:17,607
Matron.

717
00:47:21,118 --> 00:47:25,487
Mrs. Collins, you still insist that
the boy out there is not your son?

718
00:47:25,556 --> 00:47:26,887
Yes, I do.

719
00:47:30,394 --> 00:47:31,691
Please, don't struggle.
What?

720
00:47:31,762 --> 00:47:32,922
No!
You'll only hurt yourself.

721
00:47:32,997 --> 00:47:34,259
What are you doing?
Hold still.

722
00:47:34,331 --> 00:47:35,889
You can't just do this.
No, you can't.

723
00:47:35,966 --> 00:47:37,092
You are to
convey the prisoner

724
00:47:37,168 --> 00:47:39,261
to the Los Angeles County General
Hospital Psychopathic Ward.

725
00:47:39,336 --> 00:47:40,496
What?

726
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:42,766
You are to make
the following entry.

727
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,434
Defendant states she's been
deceived by police and others,

728
00:47:45,509 --> 00:47:46,999
and that we have given
her a boy and tried

729
00:47:47,077 --> 00:47:49,875
to make her think it is her
son when she says it is not.

730
00:47:49,947 --> 00:47:53,041
Take her away.
No. No, no.

731
00:47:54,151 --> 00:47:55,379
Please. Please.

732
00:47:55,452 --> 00:47:56,612
Come on,
Mrs. Collins.

733
00:47:56,687 --> 00:47:58,587
No. No.

734
00:47:58,656 --> 00:47:59,816
This way.

735
00:48:04,128 --> 00:48:08,064
<i>Mrs. Collins has been known to
us since about March 10th, 1928</i>

736
00:48:08,132 --> 00:48:10,930
<i>when she reported her
nine-year-old son, Walter, missing.</i>

737
00:48:11,001 --> 00:48:13,663
<i>The boy was gone until
August 1928. Okay.</i>

738
00:48:14,038 --> 00:48:17,633
<i>Since his return, she has
complained that he is still missing</i>

739
00:48:17,708 --> 00:48:20,370
<i>and has made repeated
requests that he be found.</i>

740
00:48:20,444 --> 00:48:25,541
<i>She suffers from paranoia, delusions of
persecution and dislocation from reality.</i>

741
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:29,110
<i>She may be a threat
to herself or others.</i>

742
00:48:29,253 --> 00:48:32,882
<i>We recommend that she be
conveyed to the psychopathic ward</i>

743
00:48:32,957 --> 00:48:34,652
<i>until her senses
can be restored.</i>

744
00:48:34,725 --> 00:48:35,987
Got another code 12.

745
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,152
Name?

746
00:48:37,228 --> 00:48:38,286
Collins. Christine.

747
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:39,829
No, no, no, listen,
this is a mistake.

748
00:48:39,897 --> 00:48:41,159
Certifying officer?

749
00:48:41,232 --> 00:48:43,723
Captain J.J. Jones,
Lincoln Heights Division.

750
00:48:43,801 --> 00:48:45,792
No, no, please! Please! The
police are trying to punish me...

751
00:48:45,869 --> 00:48:47,962
If you keep it up, I'm gonna
have to put you in a straitjacket.

752
00:48:48,038 --> 00:48:49,300
Do you want that?

753
00:48:49,373 --> 00:48:50,431
No, ma'am.

754
00:48:50,507 --> 00:48:52,907
Then behave yourself.
Code 12.

755
00:48:53,978 --> 00:48:55,605
I'm not mad!

756
00:48:55,679 --> 00:48:57,044
Please.

757
00:48:58,983 --> 00:49:00,177
Oh, God.

758
00:49:00,251 --> 00:49:01,582
All right.

759
00:49:06,857 --> 00:49:08,119
No!

760
00:49:17,034 --> 00:49:18,228
Stop!

761
00:49:24,475 --> 00:49:26,102
Spread your legs.

762
00:49:26,677 --> 00:49:27,769
What?

763
00:49:31,315 --> 00:49:32,782
Wider.

764
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:34,477
Oh.

765
00:49:45,296 --> 00:49:48,129
I'm not sick!

766
00:49:54,705 --> 00:49:55,865
Touch me! Touch me!

767
00:49:57,875 --> 00:50:00,400
Inside. This is your room.

768
00:50:00,477 --> 00:50:02,570
The doctor has left for the day.
He will see you in the morning.

769
00:50:02,646 --> 00:50:05,012
Can I... I need to speak
to somebody in authority.

770
00:50:05,082 --> 00:50:06,208
Sorry.

771
00:50:06,283 --> 00:50:10,947
My room! No. No, no,
no, this is my room.

772
00:50:11,322 --> 00:50:12,380
Can I make
a phone call?

773
00:50:12,456 --> 00:50:14,424
Phone privileges are
earned by good behavior.

774
00:50:14,491 --> 00:50:18,222
You're not allowed newspapers,
magazines, radio, books or sharp objects.

775
00:50:18,295 --> 00:50:19,728
This is for your own good.
Help me!

776
00:50:19,797 --> 00:50:21,389
Listen to me.

777
00:50:21,465 --> 00:50:23,296
My room.

778
00:50:23,367 --> 00:50:26,063
No,
this is my room.

779
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:28,401
Oh, God!

780
00:50:28,472 --> 00:50:29,769
My room.

781
00:50:31,308 --> 00:50:34,436
No, no,
this is my room.

782
00:50:36,814 --> 00:50:38,645
My room.

783
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:44,280
My room! My room!
My room!

784
00:50:44,588 --> 00:50:46,783
My room!

785
00:50:46,857 --> 00:50:49,758
They said it was my room!

786
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:03,773
You have a problem?

787
00:51:03,841 --> 00:51:07,242
Overheated, that's all.
She'll be fine in a bit.

788
00:51:08,545 --> 00:51:10,069
Hey, listen, could
you give me a hand?

789
00:51:10,147 --> 00:51:13,947
I'm trying to find a place called
the Northcott Ranch, up by Wineville.

790
00:51:15,419 --> 00:51:17,216
Northcott Ranch, huh?

791
00:51:20,491 --> 00:51:23,790
Oh, yeah, yeah.

792
00:51:24,228 --> 00:51:26,958
You're almost there.

793
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:30,557
You just... You just
follow this road west,

794
00:51:30,634 --> 00:51:33,262
about two, no, three miles.

795
00:51:33,337 --> 00:51:35,862
And then you take
that next right.

796
00:51:35,939 --> 00:51:39,397
And you stay on that and it
will bring you right to it.

797
00:51:41,945 --> 00:51:44,277
Is something going
on out there?

798
00:51:44,348 --> 00:51:45,474
No.

799
00:51:45,549 --> 00:51:47,710
Just looking into
a juvenile matter.

800
00:51:48,919 --> 00:51:50,113
Thanks for your help.

801
00:51:50,187 --> 00:51:51,381
Sure.

802
00:52:38,302 --> 00:52:39,462
Hello?

803
00:53:25,115 --> 00:53:27,208
Hey!

804
00:53:27,284 --> 00:53:29,718
Hey! Hey!

805
00:53:29,786 --> 00:53:32,846
Come here!
Come here!

806
00:53:38,362 --> 00:53:40,091
This is the police!

807
00:53:40,163 --> 00:53:43,326
I have a warrant for a
minor named Sanford Clark.

808
00:53:44,868 --> 00:53:46,995
Open the door
or stand aside.

809
00:55:00,344 --> 00:55:01,743
Hey! Stop!

810
00:55:02,846 --> 00:55:06,111
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

811
00:55:06,183 --> 00:55:09,243
Stop it! Stop it or I'll push
your face through this floor!

812
00:55:09,319 --> 00:55:10,377
Stop it!

813
00:55:10,454 --> 00:55:11,512
Fine!

814
00:55:12,055 --> 00:55:13,989
Give me your hands.

815
00:55:23,567 --> 00:55:25,228
Come on.
Sit down.

816
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:28,032
Jesus!

817
00:55:29,673 --> 00:55:31,106
What the hell is
wrong with you, kid?

818
00:55:31,174 --> 00:55:32,607
Huh?

819
00:55:32,676 --> 00:55:34,541
Don't you know assaulting
a cop is against the law?

820
00:55:34,611 --> 00:55:36,806
What difference
does it make?

821
00:55:38,415 --> 00:55:41,043
We're just sending you
back to Canada, son.

822
00:55:41,118 --> 00:55:43,279
It isn't the end
of the world.

823
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,148
What?

824
00:55:47,057 --> 00:55:50,754
Well, you can't stay in the
U.S. As long as you want, pal.

825
00:55:55,465 --> 00:55:57,057
No word from Mrs. Collins?

826
00:55:57,134 --> 00:55:58,499
We haven't heard from her.

827
00:55:58,568 --> 00:56:00,763
Get on down to her house,
make sure she's all right.

828
00:56:00,837 --> 00:56:02,327
And if she's not there,
check with her neighbors.

829
00:56:02,406 --> 00:56:03,464
Find out what they know.

830
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:04,598
Absolutely.

831
00:56:04,675 --> 00:56:07,735
<i>And now KGF welcomes the
Reverend Gustav Briegleb</i>

832
00:56:07,811 --> 00:56:09,972
<i>of St. Paul's Presbyterian.</i>

833
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:14,449
This is Pastor Gustav A. Briegleb
of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church,

834
00:56:14,518 --> 00:56:17,385
bringing you the Lord's
word on Radio KGF.

835
00:56:17,454 --> 00:56:19,115
Good evening.

836
00:56:19,189 --> 00:56:21,123
I had hoped to have
a guest with us tonight,

837
00:56:21,191 --> 00:56:23,489
but apparently
she has been delayed.

838
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:27,519
<i>And since she cannot be here to tell you
what she told the press this afternoon,</i>

839
00:56:27,597 --> 00:56:30,225
<i>I'll have to fill in
as best I can.</i>

840
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,063
<i>I'm going to tell
you what happened</i>

841
00:56:32,135 --> 00:56:36,401
<i>and I'm going to keep on telling
you every night, right here,</i>

842
00:56:36,473 --> 00:56:39,533
<i>until somebody does
something about it.</i>

843
00:56:43,313 --> 00:56:46,407
<i>The Desert Local,
train number 45,</i>

844
00:56:46,483 --> 00:56:49,782
<i>will be arriving on
track two in five minutes.</i>

845
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:52,479
Hello. I'd like a
ticket to Canada.

846
00:56:52,556 --> 00:56:54,786
Alberta or Vancouver,
whatever's leaving tonight.

847
00:56:54,858 --> 00:56:56,826
I don't have anything
going that far tonight.

848
00:56:56,893 --> 00:56:59,123
The best I can do is put
you on a train to Seattle.

849
00:56:59,196 --> 00:57:01,960
From there you can transfer to a
local or drive across the border.

850
00:57:02,032 --> 00:57:03,431
That would be fine.

851
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,694
Roundtrip?

852
00:57:04,768 --> 00:57:05,928
One way.

853
00:57:06,002 --> 00:57:07,435
That'll be $15.

854
00:57:07,504 --> 00:57:08,562
Right.

855
00:57:12,175 --> 00:57:13,802
There you go.

856
00:57:13,877 --> 00:57:15,401
Thank you. There you
go. Enjoy your trip.

857
00:57:15,479 --> 00:57:16,673
I will.

858
00:57:34,297 --> 00:57:36,322
Breakfast is half an hour.

859
00:57:40,937 --> 00:57:43,269
Please, miss, I need to
see a doctor in charge.

860
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:44,807
The dining room
is down the hall.

861
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:47,776
The doctor will call
for you when he's ready.

862
00:57:59,756 --> 00:58:01,951
Do you want
eggs or oatmeal?

863
00:58:03,794 --> 00:58:05,455
Okay, that's everyone
that's here.

864
00:58:05,529 --> 00:58:06,894
All right.

865
00:58:06,963 --> 00:58:08,828
You can pull the oatmeal.

866
00:58:08,899 --> 00:58:10,264
Do you want
it for tomorrow?

867
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:11,698
You know, just dump it. All right.

868
00:58:11,768 --> 00:58:13,292
You should eat.

869
00:58:14,271 --> 00:58:16,068
Eating is normal.

870
00:58:16,139 --> 00:58:18,937
You gotta do everything
you can to look normal.

871
00:58:19,009 --> 00:58:20,476
It's the only chance
you got.

872
00:58:20,544 --> 00:58:21,704
I'm not hungry.

873
00:58:21,778 --> 00:58:24,042
Barbara, you have to
eat now. I'm not hungry.

874
00:58:24,114 --> 00:58:26,639
My name's Carol Dexter.
What's yours?

875
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:29,250
Christine.
Christine Collins.

876
00:58:31,288 --> 00:58:33,483
Now, finish it all. I know
it's hard, but you gotta try.

877
00:58:33,557 --> 00:58:34,854
Oh, boy.

878
00:58:41,665 --> 00:58:43,462
I heard them talking.

879
00:58:43,567 --> 00:58:45,592
You're here on code 12?

880
00:58:45,669 --> 00:58:47,330
Police action.

881
00:58:47,404 --> 00:58:48,928
I mean, the doctors,
the staff, they figure

882
00:58:49,005 --> 00:58:50,336
that if the police
brought you here,

883
00:58:50,407 --> 00:58:52,432
there must be
a good reason for it.

884
00:58:52,509 --> 00:58:54,909
There isn't a good
reason for it.

885
00:58:55,412 --> 00:58:58,677
I'm perfectly sane and I
will explain that to them.

886
00:58:59,382 --> 00:59:00,440
How?

887
00:59:01,585 --> 00:59:05,316
The more you try to act sane,
the crazier you start to look.

888
00:59:05,388 --> 00:59:09,222
If you smile too much, you're
delusional or you're stifling hysteria.

889
00:59:09,292 --> 00:59:12,056
And if you don't smile,
you're depressed.

890
00:59:12,128 --> 00:59:16,690
If you remain neutral, you're emotionally
withdrawn, potentially catatonic.

891
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:22,201
You've given this
a lot of thought.

892
00:59:22,272 --> 00:59:24,934
Yeah, I have.
Don't you get it?

893
00:59:25,775 --> 00:59:28,175
You're a code 12,
so am I.

894
00:59:28,245 --> 00:59:30,440
We're here for the
exact same reasons.

895
00:59:30,513 --> 00:59:32,640
We both pissed
off the cops.

896
00:59:33,717 --> 00:59:36,652
Now, you see, you
see that lady there?

897
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,154
She was married to a cop
who kept beating her up.

898
00:59:39,222 --> 00:59:42,248
When she tried to tell somebody
about it, he brought her here.

899
00:59:42,325 --> 00:59:43,587
I want more juice.

900
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:44,854
And that one?

901
00:59:44,928 --> 00:59:46,259
Put your tray
back where it belongs.

902
00:59:46,329 --> 00:59:50,561
The police beat the crap out of
her brother, broke both his arms.

903
00:59:50,634 --> 00:59:53,068
When she tried to
tell the papers...

904
00:59:55,639 --> 00:59:56,867
And you?

905
00:59:58,074 --> 01:00:01,066
I work nights.

906
01:00:01,611 --> 01:00:03,101
Sure.

907
01:00:04,014 --> 01:00:07,313
I mean, I work nights.

908
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:10,177
Oh.

909
01:00:10,253 --> 01:00:11,413
Yeah. In the clubs.
Downtown.

910
01:00:11,488 --> 01:00:12,546
I'm sorry.

911
01:00:12,622 --> 01:00:16,422
Yeah, well, this one client just
kept hitting me and he wouldn't stop,

912
01:00:16,493 --> 01:00:18,552
so I filed a complaint.

913
01:00:18,628 --> 01:00:21,096
And it turns out
he was a cop.

914
01:00:21,164 --> 01:00:23,291
Next thing I know,
I'm here.

915
01:00:24,034 --> 01:00:26,059
But they can't do that.

916
01:00:26,136 --> 01:00:27,194
Are you kidding?

917
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:28,794
All right, one
more and then that's it.

918
01:00:28,872 --> 01:00:31,340
Everybody knows
women are fragile.

919
01:00:31,775 --> 01:00:34,676
I mean, they're all emotions, no logic,
there's nothing going on upstairs.

920
01:00:34,744 --> 01:00:36,336
Somebody! Help me!

921
01:00:36,413 --> 01:00:39,075
Every once in a while they say
something that's a little inconvenient,

922
01:00:39,149 --> 01:00:40,707
they just go fucking nuts.

923
01:00:40,784 --> 01:00:41,910
Pardon my French.

924
01:00:41,985 --> 01:00:43,714
You gotta get those dishes. You got it.

925
01:00:43,787 --> 01:00:47,518
If we're insane, nobody
has to listen to us.

926
01:00:48,725 --> 01:00:50,352
I mean, who are
you gonna believe,

927
01:00:50,427 --> 01:00:53,760
some crazy woman trying to
destroy the integrity of the force,

928
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:55,593
or a police officer?

929
01:00:57,334 --> 01:01:00,360
Then once they get us in here, we
either shut up and we learn to behave,

930
01:01:00,437 --> 01:01:02,098
or we don't go home.

931
01:01:02,172 --> 01:01:03,799
Are you all done?

932
01:01:05,075 --> 01:01:07,043
Or we go home like that.

933
01:01:43,747 --> 01:01:47,205
Stop. Stop it.

934
01:01:48,084 --> 01:01:50,348
Stop it!
Stop it.

935
01:01:50,453 --> 01:01:51,647
Please.

936
01:01:54,357 --> 01:01:55,517
Clark.

937
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:58,049
Sanford Clark?

938
01:01:58,895 --> 01:02:00,021
Here.

939
01:02:00,997 --> 01:02:03,056
Paperwork's come through.

940
01:02:03,133 --> 01:02:05,567
You'll be deported back to
Canada day after tomorrow.

941
01:02:05,635 --> 01:02:07,899
Police there will decide
what to do with you next.

942
01:02:07,971 --> 01:02:11,270
I hope your stay here has convinced
you not to try crossing the border

943
01:02:11,341 --> 01:02:13,104
illegally in the future.

944
01:02:13,243 --> 01:02:14,335
Wait!

945
01:02:16,479 --> 01:02:19,710
I'd like to talk to the
officer who brought me in.

946
01:02:19,783 --> 01:02:21,580
I'm sure he has far
more important things...

947
01:02:21,651 --> 01:02:23,949
Please. It's important.

948
01:02:30,794 --> 01:02:32,455
Christine Collins.

949
01:02:32,529 --> 01:02:35,191
Thank you. Mrs. Collins.

950
01:02:36,966 --> 01:02:39,696
Dr. Jonathan Steele.
Please, have a seat.

951
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:50,777
I hope your stay with us
has been comfortable so far.

952
01:02:51,714 --> 01:02:52,840
Yes.

953
01:02:53,349 --> 01:02:54,816
Really?

954
01:02:54,918 --> 01:02:58,376
I'd think it'd
be quite difficult at first.

955
01:03:01,024 --> 01:03:02,218
Yes, it was.

956
01:03:02,292 --> 01:03:06,092
Of course it was very difficult,
but comfortable enough.

957
01:03:16,406 --> 01:03:19,773
I see that they have...
They've taken a blood test.

958
01:03:21,044 --> 01:03:22,807
The Wassermman Test.

959
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:27,009
They said it was to check for
syphilis, 'cause it affects the mind.

960
01:03:27,117 --> 01:03:30,917
The idea that someone thinks you
need to be checked for syphilis,

961
01:03:30,987 --> 01:03:32,852
does that upset you?

962
01:03:32,922 --> 01:03:35,254
No, they said it was standard
procedure, so it did not.

963
01:03:35,325 --> 01:03:37,725
Yes, exactly.
Standard procedure.

964
01:03:37,794 --> 01:03:39,659
We have to cover
all our bases.

965
01:03:39,729 --> 01:03:41,162
I can imagine

966
01:03:43,466 --> 01:03:46,128
that for some people that
would be uncomfortable,

967
01:03:46,202 --> 01:03:48,363
but I understood.

968
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:12,226
According to your file you
believe that the police substituted

969
01:04:12,328 --> 01:04:14,421
a fake boy for your son.

970
01:04:14,497 --> 01:04:16,692
No, I didn't say
he was a fake boy.

971
01:04:16,766 --> 01:04:18,859
He's not my boy.

972
01:04:18,935 --> 01:04:20,368
They brought home
the wrong boy.

973
01:04:20,436 --> 01:04:22,404
My son is still missing.

974
01:04:22,605 --> 01:04:27,474
Well, that's strange, because
I have here a newspaper article

975
01:04:27,944 --> 01:04:33,439
with a photo of you at the train
station, welcoming home your son.

976
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:38,514
That is you in the
photo, isn't it?

977
01:04:39,088 --> 01:04:40,112
Yes.

978
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:41,282
Yeah.

979
01:04:41,991 --> 01:04:43,015
Yes.

980
01:04:43,092 --> 01:04:46,027
So, at first
he was your son,

981
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:49,327
and now he's not your son.

982
01:04:51,301 --> 01:04:53,201
Has this been going
on for a long time?

983
01:04:53,269 --> 01:04:56,898
People changing, becoming
something other than what they are?

984
01:04:56,973 --> 01:04:58,838
People don't change.

985
01:04:58,908 --> 01:05:00,466
You don't think
people change?

986
01:05:00,543 --> 01:05:01,635
No, that's not...

987
01:05:05,281 --> 01:05:07,545
The police, they're not
out to persecute you?

988
01:05:07,617 --> 01:05:09,977
No, they're not.

989
01:05:10,053 --> 01:05:13,147
The police are here
to protect you.

990
01:05:13,923 --> 01:05:15,185
Yes.

991
01:05:15,425 --> 01:05:16,858
Really?

992
01:05:16,926 --> 01:05:17,984
Yes.

993
01:05:19,062 --> 01:05:23,431
Well, that's odd because
when you were admitted,

994
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:30,635
you told the head nurse that the police
were conspiring deliberately to punish you.

995
01:05:30,773 --> 01:05:35,176
So, either the head nurse and the
interns are also conspiring to punish you

996
01:05:35,245 --> 01:05:37,475
or you're changing
your story.

997
01:05:43,786 --> 01:05:49,816
Do you often have trouble telling
reality from fantasy, Mrs. Collins?

998
01:05:52,295 --> 01:05:53,319
No.

999
01:06:05,208 --> 01:06:07,233
I'm sorry to bring you out
in this weather, Detective,

1000
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:09,301
but the boy has
been quite insistent.

1001
01:06:09,379 --> 01:06:10,744
It's all right.

1002
01:06:10,813 --> 01:06:13,748
I'll see what he has to say
so I can go home and get dry.

1003
01:06:13,816 --> 01:06:16,444
It's raining cats, dogs,
and Democrats out there,

1004
01:06:16,519 --> 01:06:18,817
so this had better
be worth it.

1005
01:06:19,389 --> 01:06:20,913
You again, huh?

1006
01:06:27,563 --> 01:06:28,757
We'll see.

1007
01:06:32,502 --> 01:06:33,594
Well?

1008
01:06:36,439 --> 01:06:37,667
This isn't easy, okay?

1009
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:38,729
Yeah?

1010
01:06:38,808 --> 01:06:42,141
Driving my ass here in the
pouring rain wasn't easy either.

1011
01:06:43,813 --> 01:06:46,577
My cousin is
Gordon Northcott.

1012
01:06:46,649 --> 01:06:49,243
He owns the ranch
where you found me.

1013
01:06:50,253 --> 01:06:54,246
He said I could live there in exchange
I watch the place when he's gone,

1014
01:06:55,124 --> 01:06:57,285
doing chores
and stuff like that.

1015
01:06:58,828 --> 01:07:01,626
Said I could stay as
long as I wanted to.

1016
01:07:02,598 --> 01:07:05,328
I thought that meant I could
leave whenever I wanted.

1017
01:07:05,401 --> 01:07:06,459
Mmm.

1018
01:07:06,536 --> 01:07:08,834
You saying that he
held you prisoner?

1019
01:07:08,905 --> 01:07:10,065
Bull.

1020
01:07:10,139 --> 01:07:13,006
When I got there, you were
running around free as a jaybird.

1021
01:07:13,076 --> 01:07:15,010
Could've left any
time you wanted.

1022
01:07:15,078 --> 01:07:16,102
No.

1023
01:07:16,212 --> 01:07:17,941
So, what's this, huh?

1024
01:07:18,047 --> 01:07:20,072
Some kind of story to cover why
you're in the country illegally?

1025
01:07:20,149 --> 01:07:21,275
No, it's nothing like that.

1026
01:07:21,351 --> 01:07:22,409
'Cause I don't have
time for this, okay?

1027
01:07:22,485 --> 01:07:23,645
Listen to me!
He said...

1028
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:24,982
What?

1029
01:07:25,054 --> 01:07:26,783
What did he say?

1030
01:07:26,856 --> 01:07:30,155
He said that if I tried
to leave, he'd kill me.

1031
01:07:30,226 --> 01:07:33,252
Look, you don't understand
what he's like,

1032
01:07:33,329 --> 01:07:36,662
what he... What we did,
what he made me do.

1033
01:07:39,168 --> 01:07:40,635
All right.

1034
01:07:40,703 --> 01:07:43,137
Let's start at
the beginning then.

1035
01:07:46,776 --> 01:07:48,869
What'd he make you do?

1036
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:55,649
We killed some kids.

1037
01:07:55,718 --> 01:07:56,980
What?

1038
01:07:57,053 --> 01:08:00,648
Look, I didn't mean to, I
swear. He made me help him.

1039
01:08:00,723 --> 01:08:03,317
He said if I didn't,
he'd kill me, too.

1040
01:08:03,393 --> 01:08:06,089
Look, you gotta help me,
please. I'm so scared.

1041
01:08:06,162 --> 01:08:09,154
I don't want to go
to hell for killing kids.

1042
01:08:09,232 --> 01:08:10,597
Look.

1043
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:13,499
What kids? What... What
are you talking about?

1044
01:08:13,569 --> 01:08:16,094
I don't know.
I never knew their names.

1045
01:08:16,172 --> 01:08:17,662
Names?

1046
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:18,764
How many?

1047
01:08:18,841 --> 01:08:20,331
How many kids?

1048
01:08:20,410 --> 01:08:21,775
All together?

1049
01:08:26,182 --> 01:08:28,047
About 20, I guess.

1050
01:08:29,419 --> 01:08:30,818
No, you're lying.

1051
01:08:30,887 --> 01:08:33,253
No! It's true, I swear!

1052
01:08:33,322 --> 01:08:34,983
You're gonna tell me
you killed 20 kids?

1053
01:08:35,057 --> 01:08:38,515
Yeah! Thereabouts.

1054
01:08:40,863 --> 01:08:43,263
I stopped counting
after a while.

1055
01:08:47,103 --> 01:08:50,869
Gordon said maybe one
or two may have escaped.

1056
01:08:54,577 --> 01:08:55,601
But...

1057
01:08:55,678 --> 01:08:56,702
No.

1058
01:08:56,779 --> 01:08:59,612
Nobody can just up
and kill 20 kids, okay?

1059
01:08:59,682 --> 01:09:00,876
We did.

1060
01:09:03,286 --> 01:09:04,480
We did.

1061
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:08,448
How?

1062
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,926
Most times we'd just
have one or two.

1063
01:09:14,564 --> 01:09:16,498
Sometimes as many as three.

1064
01:09:19,068 --> 01:09:22,299
<i>I always knew when we
were getting ready to leave.</i>

1065
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:26,469
<i>Clean up the car.</i>

1066
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:29,740
<i>Make sure the tires
were good.</i>

1067
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,477
<i>Check the engine.</i>

1068
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:37,642
<i>'Cause he was afraid that
the car would break down</i>

1069
01:09:39,322 --> 01:09:41,187
<i>and we'd get caught.</i>

1070
01:09:43,326 --> 01:09:45,089
<i>My loving baby</i>

1071
01:09:45,161 --> 01:09:48,255
We'd always go a different
direction every time.

1072
01:09:50,099 --> 01:09:52,499
Never hit the same
part of town twice.

1073
01:09:52,602 --> 01:09:56,003
<i>Sometimes we'd just
drive around for hours,</i>

1074
01:09:56,639 --> 01:09:58,106
<i>till we found somebody.</i>

1075
01:09:58,174 --> 01:09:59,698
Well, there you are!

1076
01:09:59,775 --> 01:10:01,572
We've been looking
for you like mad.

1077
01:10:01,644 --> 01:10:02,906
You have?

1078
01:10:02,979 --> 01:10:04,344
Sure thing.

1079
01:10:04,413 --> 01:10:07,348
Listen, your folks,
they've been in an accident.

1080
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:10,448
And they sent us to come find
you. Now, they're hurt real bad.

1081
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:13,284
The police took them to the hospital, but
they didn't have time to come find you,

1082
01:10:13,356 --> 01:10:15,347
so we said that
we would do it.

1083
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:17,024
Now, come on.

1084
01:10:17,093 --> 01:10:19,653
All right.
Get in here. Hurry.

1085
01:10:19,729 --> 01:10:23,062
Listen, we gotta get you to that
hospital so you can see your folks.

1086
01:10:23,132 --> 01:10:26,363
<i>See, a lot of kids won't get
in a car alone with a stranger,</i>

1087
01:10:26,435 --> 01:10:27,766
<i>but when he's got
a kid there...</i>

1088
01:10:27,837 --> 01:10:29,464
There's a good boy.

1089
01:10:29,539 --> 01:10:30,938
Scoot over.
Scoot over, San.

1090
01:10:31,007 --> 01:10:32,565
<i>...that made it easier.</i>

1091
01:10:32,642 --> 01:10:34,109
I want you to hold on tight.

1092
01:10:34,176 --> 01:10:35,473
<i>They'd look
at me and say...</i>

1093
01:10:35,545 --> 01:10:36,807
We've got a long way to go.

1094
01:10:36,879 --> 01:10:38,039
<i>"Hey, if he's safe... "</i>

1095
01:10:38,114 --> 01:10:39,274
And we are gonna fly.

1096
01:10:39,348 --> 01:10:41,612
<i>"... I guess
I will be, too. "</i>

1097
01:10:43,586 --> 01:10:46,077
Every time they got
in the truck,

1098
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:48,882
I just wanted to die.

1099
01:10:50,459 --> 01:10:53,690
As soon as we got back to the
ranch, they went in the coop.

1100
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:56,562
You boys hungry?

1101
01:10:56,632 --> 01:10:57,724
Huh?

1102
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,631
Watch the door, Sanford!

1103
01:10:59,735 --> 01:11:01,703
Hey! Watch the door!

1104
01:11:02,605 --> 01:11:04,038
What's the matter?

1105
01:11:04,106 --> 01:11:05,368
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1106
01:11:05,441 --> 01:11:06,931
Are you worried that
I'm gonna hurt you?

1107
01:11:07,009 --> 01:11:08,101
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1108
01:11:08,177 --> 01:11:09,644
Huh? Come here.

1109
01:11:09,712 --> 01:11:11,703
No! No! No! No! Please!
I would never hurt you.

1110
01:11:11,781 --> 01:11:14,443
Some days
he'd do them right off.

1111
01:11:15,918 --> 01:11:19,285
Other days he'd wait,

1112
01:11:20,690 --> 01:11:22,988
pick up a few more,

1113
01:11:23,059 --> 01:11:26,085
until he had about
four or five of them.

1114
01:11:26,662 --> 01:11:27,788
Yeah.

1115
01:11:27,863 --> 01:11:29,194
No! No! No!
No what?

1116
01:11:29,265 --> 01:11:30,357
No what, huh?

1117
01:11:31,701 --> 01:11:32,929
Come on. Come on. Come on!

1118
01:11:33,002 --> 01:11:34,936
Sanford, keep your
eye on that door!

1119
01:11:35,004 --> 01:11:37,768
No! Please, no! No! No!

1120
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,207
No! No! No! No!
Please! No! No!

1121
01:11:43,079 --> 01:11:46,173
He'd... He'd
sometimes leave

1122
01:11:46,248 --> 01:11:50,582
just one or two of them
alive, barely, anyway.

1123
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:52,881
He'd say,

1124
01:11:52,955 --> 01:11:54,752
"Finish them, San.

1125
01:11:54,824 --> 01:11:58,123
"Finish them or... Finish
them or I'll finish you. "

1126
01:12:00,896 --> 01:12:02,261
And I did.

1127
01:12:04,133 --> 01:12:05,794
And I killed them.

1128
01:12:05,868 --> 01:12:07,096
And I did.

1129
01:12:07,169 --> 01:12:08,727
I killed them.

1130
01:12:08,804 --> 01:12:10,704
Oh, God, I killed them!

1131
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:14,209
Oh, God! Oh!

1132
01:12:15,444 --> 01:12:17,569
Hey.

1133
01:12:17,647 --> 01:12:18,739
What?

1134
01:12:18,814 --> 01:12:20,179
Look at me.

1135
01:12:21,751 --> 01:12:23,116
These kids.

1136
01:12:23,586 --> 01:12:28,523
You think if you saw them again, you
think you might be able to recognize them?

1137
01:12:28,858 --> 01:12:30,985
I don't know.

1138
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,220
Maybe.
