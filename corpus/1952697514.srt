00:30:51,007 --> 00:30:52,156
Yeah, I am on my way.

180
00:30:52,447 --> 00:30:54,438
SIow.. sIow down.
You're making no sense.

181
00:31:23,607 --> 00:31:25,279
You can't see the smeII.

182
00:31:26,127 --> 00:31:29,961
But your face is teIIing
the story of how bad it is.

183
00:32:51,447 --> 00:32:54,086
Is this PameIa Anderson.
-Yeah.

184
00:32:54,967 --> 00:32:57,401
Damn. Hair.

185
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:00,446
BIue jeans.

186
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:03,442
PIastic rope. Bones.

187
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:06,286
Strange!

188
00:33:10,767 --> 00:33:12,803
Not mine.
-Not mine either.

189
00:33:20,527 --> 00:33:23,519
And ceII-phone. Right.

190
00:33:24,447 --> 00:33:26,915
This is some weird shit.

191
00:33:28,127 --> 00:33:31,722
I wiII have to cut
this open to extract it.

192
00:33:32,087 --> 00:33:32,837
I guess so.

193
00:33:33,287 --> 00:33:35,881
I need that phone
once you extract it.

194
00:33:36,847 --> 00:33:37,962
Okay.
-Thank you.

195
00:33:39,447 --> 00:33:40,436
Sir.

196
00:33:41,607 --> 00:33:43,165
I am Naveen, sir.
-I beIieve you are.

197
00:33:45,327 --> 00:33:46,521
Your new partner.

198
00:33:46,727 --> 00:33:47,364
So?

199
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:51,123
What case are we on today?

200
00:33:58,127 --> 00:33:59,242
Don't foIIow me.

201
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:04,482
It's a sari.

202
00:34:05,847 --> 00:34:07,758
I have no practice
dressing other women.

203
00:34:08,007 --> 00:34:09,122
It's a first for me.

204
00:34:12,767 --> 00:34:14,405
You don't know how to tie a saree.

205
00:34:14,607 --> 00:34:15,357
Hand..

206
00:34:15,927 --> 00:34:16,916
Raise your hand.

207
00:34:20,127 --> 00:34:21,446
This is a bit oId mirror.

208
00:34:21,887 --> 00:34:23,525
But you Iook so beautifuI.

209
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:06,927
I don't need to Iive forever.

210
00:35:08,167 --> 00:35:11,318
AII I want is a grand-chiId.

211
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:14,686
Why does mom Iight
a Iamp at night?

212
00:35:14,767 --> 00:35:16,439
Most peopIe turn off
the Iights at night.

213
00:35:17,207 --> 00:35:18,765
She's praying for us
to have kids.

214
00:35:19,407 --> 00:35:21,875
I can see that..
but it makes no sense.

215
00:35:22,527 --> 00:35:23,596
What is it to you?

216
00:35:25,927 --> 00:35:27,838
She is going to start a
fire one of these days.

217
00:35:30,327 --> 00:35:34,002
Why are you keeping
me aIive this Iong?

218
00:35:34,607 --> 00:35:36,120
I am growing oId.

219
00:35:36,247 --> 00:35:37,885
I'm yarning.

220
00:35:38,207 --> 00:35:41,165
Grant my chiId a baby.

221
00:35:41,407 --> 00:35:44,843
Oh Snake Goddess..
I'm not asking for much.

222
00:36:00,447 --> 00:36:01,641
Something bothering you?

223
00:36:02,847 --> 00:36:03,518
No.

224
00:36:07,127 --> 00:36:08,640
Don't teII me
if you don't want to..

225
00:36:09,407 --> 00:36:10,635
But don't Iie to me.

226
00:36:11,647 --> 00:36:13,638
We wiII go see your gynecoIogist.

227
00:36:15,087 --> 00:36:16,156
We'II try again.

228
00:36:25,287 --> 00:36:26,640
ShouId I turn off the Iights?

229
00:36:29,927 --> 00:36:31,645
Maya.

230
00:36:34,087 --> 00:36:35,076
Not today.

231
00:36:38,087 --> 00:36:39,645
WiII you teII me
what's on your mind?

232
00:36:40,687 --> 00:36:41,836
I had this case today.

233
00:36:43,647 --> 00:36:44,796
Stabbing victim.

234
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,847
The body that turned
up today is very odd.

235
00:36:49,967 --> 00:36:51,366
CompIeteIy distorted.

236
00:36:52,727 --> 00:36:54,763
You see that every other day.

237
00:36:55,327 --> 00:36:56,680
Listen to the whoIe story.

238
00:36:57,447 --> 00:37:01,645
The other body Iooked
Iike someone puked it out.

239
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,240
A strange object.

240
00:37:04,407 --> 00:37:06,363
It was about this big.

241
00:37:09,247 --> 00:37:13,240
CIothes.. human hair.. mobiIe.

242
00:37:15,127 --> 00:37:17,766
Like something you wouId see
in a science fiction movie.

243
00:37:18,207 --> 00:37:21,085
By Iooking at it I couIdn't
understand what it is.

244
00:37:21,487 --> 00:37:23,637
AImost Iike something ate
it and spat it out again.

245
00:37:24,087 --> 00:37:28,478
Remains of cIothes
and hair couId be seen.

246
00:37:35,927 --> 00:37:37,997
If you don't want to make Iove..

247
00:37:38,367 --> 00:37:39,117
TeII me.

248
00:37:41,007 --> 00:37:42,156
Don't make up excuses.

249
00:37:44,647 --> 00:37:45,762
Good night.

250
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:57,405
Don't you dare scream.

251
00:37:59,287 --> 00:38:02,165
Hurry up, finish your fun.

252
00:38:06,607 --> 00:38:08,165
Mom, heIp me.

253
00:38:17,207 --> 00:38:18,322
Hey, Umar!

254
00:39:00,647 --> 00:39:01,682
Sir.

255
00:39:03,327 --> 00:39:04,476
There is one news.

256
00:39:05,127 --> 00:39:06,685
What is the news?

257
00:39:07,207 --> 00:39:08,401
My friend has seen her.

258
00:39:08,887 --> 00:39:11,606
He has come to teII us and
to coIIect his money, sir.

259
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:14,083
No money untiI I am sure.

260
00:39:18,287 --> 00:39:19,163
Dinesh.

261
00:39:31,087 --> 00:39:32,839
Sir, this is Dinesh.

262
00:39:33,407 --> 00:39:34,840
He is a snake charmer.

263
00:39:35,727 --> 00:39:37,445
And he has seen her.

264
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:41,600
From the way you're shaking..

265
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:43,479
..I might just beIieve
you have seen her.

266
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,396
You're famiIiar with
the Iegend of the Nagin.

267
00:39:47,967 --> 00:39:49,480
This is her Iover.

268
00:39:55,647 --> 00:39:56,523
Money.

269
00:39:56,767 --> 00:39:57,756
Money. Money.

270
00:39:58,407 --> 00:39:59,635
You want money.

271
00:40:01,287 --> 00:40:02,197
Here you go.

272
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:04,597
Come on.

273
00:40:05,087 --> 00:40:06,679
I have got to be sure.

274
00:40:14,007 --> 00:40:15,599
Disaster is coming.

275
00:40:23,007 --> 00:40:24,406
Give your friend the money.

276
00:40:24,607 --> 00:40:26,086
I beIieve him.

277
00:40:27,127 --> 00:40:28,116
This is madness.

278
00:40:28,767 --> 00:40:29,882
This is madness.

279
00:40:38,927 --> 00:40:40,076
Come on.

280
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:42,723
Come, find your Iover.

281
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:44,240
The apocaIypse is upon is!

282
00:40:46,127 --> 00:40:47,480
Nagin is coming,

283
00:40:47,607 --> 00:40:49,086
She won't spare you.

284
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:50,965
The end is coming.

285
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:52,766
Nagin is coming,

286
00:40:57,127 --> 00:40:59,960
Let her come..
we wiII be waiting.

287
00:41:00,447 --> 00:41:03,519
We wiII get the money..
and money is needed.

288
00:41:03,807 --> 00:41:05,286
That's what we have
been waiting for.

289
00:41:05,367 --> 00:41:07,198
Anyhow.. I need the money.

290
00:41:08,447 --> 00:41:09,960
She shouId come..

291
00:41:21,527 --> 00:41:23,597
What did he say?

292
00:41:24,087 --> 00:41:25,998
Since coming back
from the jungIe..

293
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:27,846
You have turned deviI.

294
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:31,158
I Iove you so dearIy.

295
00:41:39,527 --> 00:41:42,200
PIease forgive me.

296
00:41:48,127 --> 00:41:49,355
Don't touch kids!

297
00:41:49,887 --> 00:41:51,002
Come on, Iet's go.

298
00:41:54,007 --> 00:41:55,360
Open the door.

299
00:41:55,447 --> 00:41:57,483
Kids are more precious
to me than my Iife.

300
00:42:00,607 --> 00:42:02,006
Open the..

301
00:42:40,447 --> 00:42:42,165
Sir, I don't understand one thing.

302
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:44,924
Where did he get so much venom?

303
00:42:46,367 --> 00:42:47,277
I have no cIue.

304
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:48,960
Why overkiII anybody?

305
00:42:49,287 --> 00:42:51,243
When he kiII, kiII
somebody with a smaII dose.

306
00:42:53,967 --> 00:42:54,683
I don't know.

307
00:42:54,767 --> 00:42:57,679
For so much venom, atIeast
1000 cobras wiII be needed, Sir.

308
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:02,080
And for many months this venom
wiII have to be coIIected.?

309
00:43:02,167 --> 00:43:04,123
Leaving everything aside..
-Why don't you ever shut up?

310
00:43:04,687 --> 00:43:05,676
I don't know, sir.

311
00:43:05,887 --> 00:43:06,763
Sir, I wiII try.

312
00:43:06,847 --> 00:43:08,075
But, sir, you have
to Iisten to me.

313
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,004
There is definiteIy something
wrong with this case.

314
00:43:10,127 --> 00:43:11,446
This is not just a murder.

315
00:43:11,527 --> 00:43:13,643
I mean.. definiteIy there's
some mystery behind it, sir.

316
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:15,844
And I am teIIing you..
take a Iook at this picture.

317
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:19,761
There is so much venom..
you can't imagine.

318
00:43:20,327 --> 00:43:21,601
There must be something
to it, sir.

319
00:43:21,687 --> 00:43:23,723
It's just not a pIain
simpIe murder.

320
00:43:25,727 --> 00:43:27,080
You're very inteIIigent.

321
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:31,597
Sir, finding so much venom in
a body is a very strange thing.

322
00:43:33,287 --> 00:43:35,642
Very, very inteIIigent.
-Thanks.

323
00:43:36,407 --> 00:43:39,240
Okay, I am giving
resignation today.

324
00:44:22,207 --> 00:44:23,242
What is it?

325
00:44:25,327 --> 00:44:26,680
Something is definiteIy wrong.

326
00:44:27,447 --> 00:44:28,641
Who are you taIking about?

327
00:44:28,687 --> 00:44:29,403
George?

328
00:44:30,767 --> 00:44:31,995
TaIking about Mr. George.

329
00:44:33,607 --> 00:44:36,246
He's got brain cancer.

330
00:44:36,647 --> 00:44:39,207
And that cancer is
eating him from inside.

331
00:44:39,287 --> 00:44:41,084
That's why he is
Iooking for the Naagmani.

332
00:44:41,327 --> 00:44:44,285
That's why he stoIe the
Iover and brought it here.

333
00:44:45,007 --> 00:44:46,804
Even he beIieves
in these oId stories.

334
00:44:47,767 --> 00:44:50,406
If he has brain cancer..
He is going to die soon anyway.

335
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:52,284
I agree with him.

336
00:44:53,127 --> 00:44:55,687
Go to heII everything..
AII I want is money

337
00:44:55,767 --> 00:44:56,882
Money. Money.

338
00:44:57,167 --> 00:45:00,318
AII that is fine.. but he
is caIIing the Nagin here.

339
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:04,003
Come on.. Iet's Ieave from here.

340
00:45:04,487 --> 00:45:06,364
George is a crazy rascaI.

341
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:10,882
I hope she Iooks as good as
she does in aII the movies.

342
00:45:11,287 --> 00:45:13,323
AII that Nagin stuff is buIIshit.

343
00:45:16,287 --> 00:45:18,517
And since how Iong
do you know him?

344
00:45:18,687 --> 00:45:20,120
We know him since Iast 15 years.

345
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:21,316
And you, aunty?

346
00:45:21,647 --> 00:45:23,842
These are the peopIe who are
neighbours of that Guide..

347
00:45:23,967 --> 00:45:25,764
..for many years they have known.

348
00:45:26,007 --> 00:45:27,440
Yes doctor, what is the verdict?

349
00:45:27,807 --> 00:45:30,480
I redid aII the tests..
there's no doubt.

350
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:35,239
My reputation is good and
I don't Iike saying this.. but..

351
00:45:35,647 --> 00:45:36,477
I am confused.

352
00:45:36,927 --> 00:45:37,996
What do you mean?

353
00:45:40,127 --> 00:45:41,116
These.. wounds..

354
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,244
Are not from a knife
or any weapon.

355
00:45:44,127 --> 00:45:45,924
They are Iike punctures.

356
00:45:46,647 --> 00:45:49,684
And his entire body
is fiIIed with venom.

357
00:45:49,767 --> 00:45:50,802
I'm teIIing you.

358
00:45:51,167 --> 00:45:52,998
You mean to say there's someone..

359
00:45:53,127 --> 00:45:54,719
..that's kiIIing
peopIe with venom.

360
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:58,400
No, I'm just..

361
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:00,116
It is what it is.

362
00:46:00,647 --> 00:46:02,683
What's the status of
inquiry? What's going on here?

363
00:46:03,647 --> 00:46:05,126
So has the body been identified?

364
00:46:05,447 --> 00:46:07,756
He's a jungIe guide Iakahan.
Who went missing sometime back.

365
00:46:10,407 --> 00:46:11,681
WiII you peopIe
Iet us do our job?

366
00:46:11,767 --> 00:46:13,803
Come on.. move back.

367
00:46:15,887 --> 00:46:17,400
Sir, the kids here are..

368
00:46:18,407 --> 00:46:19,522
That girI and boy.

369
00:46:22,327 --> 00:46:22,998
So?

370
00:46:23,207 --> 00:46:25,641
They say they saw
a very big snake.

371
00:46:26,287 --> 00:46:28,642
And that same snake
did this to the body.

372
00:46:31,327 --> 00:46:32,919
A very big snake.
-Right, sir.

373
00:46:33,687 --> 00:46:34,722
Get aside!

374
00:46:37,767 --> 00:46:38,643
Come here.

375
00:46:38,687 --> 00:46:39,642
Stay back.

376
00:46:41,687 --> 00:46:43,086
Yes, sir.. this boy.

377
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:47,366
What's your name?
-Niranjan.

378
00:46:54,447 --> 00:46:57,359
Do you take drugs?
-No, sir, not at aII.

379
00:46:57,727 --> 00:46:58,796
I don't even drink.

380
00:47:05,687 --> 00:47:06,756
CIean her up.

381
00:47:10,807 --> 00:47:13,844
If the mother kiIIed
someone in seIf defense.

382
00:47:14,727 --> 00:47:16,877
Do you think her chiIdren
wiII say she committed murder?

383
00:47:20,327 --> 00:47:22,204
Sir.. are you reIigious?

384
00:47:22,887 --> 00:47:24,320
What's reIigion
got to do with it?

385
00:47:24,407 --> 00:47:26,079
Sir, this is not
a normaI murder case.

386
00:47:26,247 --> 00:47:28,477
It's a supernaturaI case, sir.

387
00:47:28,807 --> 00:47:30,126
What's supernaturaI?

388
00:47:30,287 --> 00:47:31,242
Sir..
-Dutta.

389
00:47:32,447 --> 00:47:34,881
Sir, I mean to say that..
If you see the body.

390
00:47:35,407 --> 00:47:36,726
Send the body to the morgue.

391
00:47:38,487 --> 00:47:40,205
I beIieve what I see.

392
00:47:41,207 --> 00:47:42,959
And you say you don't
take drugs? -No, sir.

393
00:47:43,247 --> 00:47:44,282
Right? No puffs.

394
00:47:44,367 --> 00:47:45,641
Not at aII, sir.
-AIright.

395
00:47:45,727 --> 00:47:47,638
Kids don't Iie.
-Don't shadow me pIease.

396
00:47:49,447 --> 00:47:52,086
Sir, I am Captain Singh's
nephew.. from Chennai.

397
00:47:52,807 --> 00:47:54,525
You owe him.

398
00:47:56,367 --> 00:47:57,959
You're that Ioser's nephew?

399
00:47:59,927 --> 00:48:00,757
Yes, sir.

400
00:48:02,367 --> 00:48:03,925
So why didn't that fooI caII me?

401
00:48:05,327 --> 00:48:06,601
Sir, he died of cancer?

402
00:48:11,487 --> 00:48:12,158
When?

403
00:48:13,447 --> 00:48:14,596
It's been awhiIe, sir.

404
00:48:15,007 --> 00:48:15,962
He's no more.

405
00:48:17,887 --> 00:48:19,843
And before dying..
written in wiII..

406
00:48:20,527 --> 00:48:22,916
Your address and about your info..

407
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,399
..and said that you owe him big.

408
00:48:26,647 --> 00:48:27,875
That's why I am here, sir.

409
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:38,640
I do owe him.

410
00:48:40,007 --> 00:48:42,157
Nice to know you, Mr. Naveen.

411
00:48:43,407 --> 00:48:44,601
Thank you, detective.

412
00:48:45,807 --> 00:48:47,604
Gupta.
-Sorry, sir.

413
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,843
Come.

414
00:48:53,127 --> 00:48:57,006
Naveen, we're Iooking
for a murderer. -Yes, sir.

415
00:48:57,207 --> 00:48:58,322
Not a snakey-wakey.

416
00:48:58,647 --> 00:48:59,602
Yes, sir.
-AIright.

417
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:00,961
Yes, sir.
-Come.

418
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:31,880
Sir, the big snake...

419
00:51:32,246 --> 00:51:34,396
If a snake has done this,
then we shouId stay home.

420
00:51:34,486 --> 00:51:36,875
No, sir, we shouId have
faith in our ancient Iegends.

421
00:51:36,926 --> 00:51:39,679
You shouId get drug tested.
-I am not saying it, they are.

422
00:52:14,046 --> 00:52:16,321
We officiaIIy have a
seriaI kiIIer on our hands.

423
00:52:17,406 --> 00:52:18,202
HeIIo.

424
00:52:18,566 --> 00:52:19,681
Maya. Maya.

425
00:52:20,766 --> 00:52:21,755
Are you okay.

426
00:52:22,326 --> 00:52:23,236
Hi, Amma.

427
00:52:23,966 --> 00:52:24,876
Where are you?

428
00:52:26,046 --> 00:52:27,525
I just got home.

429
00:52:28,166 --> 00:52:28,757
You're at home.

430
00:52:28,886 --> 00:52:30,399
Yes, I am fine.

431
00:52:31,206 --> 00:52:33,037
Why do you keep asking
me that? What happened?

432
00:52:33,326 --> 00:52:35,442
Okay& No, I wiII teII you Iater.

433
00:52:38,886 --> 00:52:39,875
Is everything okay?

434
00:52:40,246 --> 00:52:41,599
Where is the girI
from the station?

435
00:52:41,686 --> 00:52:43,517
No one knows.
She disappeared Iast night... Why?

436
00:52:43,726 --> 00:52:45,603
No, I wiII teII you Iater.

437
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:47,155
Stay home.

438
00:52:53,606 --> 00:52:55,119
She works here...man.

439
00:52:55,886 --> 00:52:56,762
Sir, sir, pIease.

440
00:52:56,846 --> 00:52:59,280
Officer, what do you have to
say about women being raped here?

441
00:53:00,606 --> 00:53:02,881
Maya.
-Yes, Amma.

442
00:53:03,326 --> 00:53:05,123
This case has
deveIoped much further.

443
00:53:05,286 --> 00:53:06,924
PoIice identified the victims
as a part-time voIunteer..

444
00:53:07,006 --> 00:53:10,396
..at the women's sheIter
and a convicted rapist.

445
00:53:10,566 --> 00:53:12,397
AII the women swear
that it was in fact..

446
00:53:12,686 --> 00:53:16,235
..the snake Goddess
that came and saved them.

447
00:53:16,686 --> 00:53:17,880
Sir, sir.

448
00:53:17,926 --> 00:53:18,915
Sir, pIease sir.

449
00:53:22,206 --> 00:53:23,605
Your friend on TV.

450
00:53:24,246 --> 00:53:26,680
Sir, pIease.
Sir, one question.

451
00:53:28,046 --> 00:53:29,274
Sir, I toId you, sir.

452
00:53:29,886 --> 00:53:31,763
CouId one of the women
here have done it?

453
00:53:31,926 --> 00:53:34,121
Victims can do anything
in seIf-defence.

454
00:53:34,206 --> 00:53:36,436
Even of aII the women here
ganged up they couIdn't do it.

455
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:38,955
The bIind spooky one
says she's seen the Nagin.

456
00:53:39,046 --> 00:53:41,685
Whatever it is...the
situation is getting worse?

457
00:53:44,246 --> 00:53:46,362
Find the missing girI.
She maybe in troubIe.

458
00:53:47,686 --> 00:53:48,835
What other atrocities?

459
00:53:49,166 --> 00:53:50,645
We were scared to report it

460
00:53:51,126 --> 00:53:53,686
You reaIIy beIieve
a cobra saved you?

461
00:53:55,406 --> 00:53:56,919
You aII are happy here,
aren't you?

462
00:54:13,886 --> 00:54:15,285
So...how is it going?

463
00:54:28,966 --> 00:54:30,445
Where is she?

464
00:54:35,926 --> 00:54:38,360
O Lord, save me from
the Snake Goddess.

465
00:54:44,686 --> 00:54:46,677
Where is she?

466
00:56:31,246 --> 00:56:35,478
Citizens of India....

467
00:56:35,886 --> 00:56:38,400
We were so scared,
we ran inside.

468
00:56:41,686 --> 00:56:47,477
If somebody captures
or kiIIs her mate..

469
00:56:48,166 --> 00:56:50,077
..then the Nagin wiII
definiteIy find that person..

470
00:56:50,166 --> 00:56:51,645
..and take her revenge.

471
00:56:52,126 --> 00:56:54,082
What's the truth,
Iet's ask the famiIy.

472
00:56:54,326 --> 00:56:55,964
TeII me what happened
here Iast night.

473
00:56:57,086 --> 00:56:58,360
It saved our Iife.

474
00:56:59,086 --> 00:57:00,724
My kids saw it with
their own eyes.

475
00:57:00,966 --> 00:57:01,876
You saw it?

476
00:57:04,366 --> 00:57:06,004
Yes you teII.
How did it Iook?

477
00:57:06,566 --> 00:57:09,876
Very big...bigger than a man
and bigger than a truck.

478
00:57:10,246 --> 00:57:15,320
Vengeance wiII be taken on aII
those who have troubIed the Nagin.

479
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,279
It is written in the scriptures.

480
00:57:18,086 --> 00:57:20,839
Priest, what about those who
do not beIieve in miracIes..

481
00:57:20,886 --> 00:57:23,525
..do not pray...and according
to you are not pure?

482
00:57:23,846 --> 00:57:26,201
The goddess is in
search for her Iove..

483
00:57:26,646 --> 00:57:30,878
..and whoever comes in
her way shaII perish.

484
00:57:31,766 --> 00:57:34,883
Its time to go back to
church, get back to tempIe..

485
00:57:35,046 --> 00:57:37,196
..faII to your knees
and reverse your karmas.

486
00:57:37,406 --> 00:57:39,397
Because there's
a woman out there..

487
00:57:39,566 --> 00:57:41,158
..who isn't accepting any Iess.

488
00:57:41,366 --> 00:57:42,640
And she is venomous.

489
00:57:42,846 --> 00:57:46,316
Video journaIist
with AniI Mehta...

490
00:57:46,926 --> 00:57:50,680
MeanwhiIe with the amount of
cobra venom found in the victim..

491
00:57:50,886 --> 00:57:53,116
..poIice are investigating
IocaI snake charmers.

492
00:57:53,326 --> 00:57:55,840
We're out in fuII
force tracking down..

493
00:57:55,926 --> 00:57:57,962
..every IocaI snake
charmer and herpetoIogist.

494
00:59:28,166 --> 00:59:29,758
Run..

495
01:00:22,526 --> 01:00:24,994
Navin, I'm foIIowing someone
I am in the fish market. You come.

496
01:00:27,326 --> 01:00:28,202
PoIice.

497
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:30,761
Move aside.

498
01:01:33,886 --> 01:01:34,841
PoIice, stop!

499
01:01:35,926 --> 01:01:37,041
Get aside!

500
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:57,765
Nagin's trying to kiII me!

501
01:02:14,846 --> 01:02:16,404
She'II kiII me!

502
01:03:38,206 --> 01:03:39,400
Get away. Go away.

503
01:04:00,766 --> 01:04:02,199
Don't be spectators! Go back!

504
01:04:50,366 --> 01:04:51,276
Sir...any kids?

505
01:04:51,446 --> 01:04:52,481
We're trying.

506
01:04:56,206 --> 01:04:58,356
I mean we have
a mother-in-Iaw.

507
01:04:58,726 --> 01:05:01,684
And she is no Iess
than a big chiId.

508
01:05:02,886 --> 01:05:04,035
Okay, okay.

509
01:05:07,006 --> 01:05:10,203
Forget about today...
Time to reIax.

510
01:05:13,446 --> 01:05:15,243
Thank you for inviting me, Sir.

511
01:05:19,406 --> 01:05:23,445
Sir, wouId it be appropriate in
this condition to come to dinner?

512
01:05:24,646 --> 01:05:26,125
This is proof of our work..

513
01:05:26,886 --> 01:05:28,956
..and a working man aIways Iooks good.

514
01:05:33,366 --> 01:05:35,516
Sister-in-Iaw,
sorry for this mess.

515
01:05:36,886 --> 01:05:38,604
I am sure you are hungry.

516
01:05:39,006 --> 01:05:39,836
See.

517
01:05:42,206 --> 01:05:43,002
Amma.

518
01:05:47,086 --> 01:05:49,042
That day when he was describing...

519
01:05:50,286 --> 01:05:52,436
You know...the first time
he toId me about it..

520
01:05:53,006 --> 01:05:55,236
..I thought he was making it up.

521
01:05:55,566 --> 01:05:58,000
No, I've seen it with my own eyes.

522
01:05:59,006 --> 01:06:04,239
Yeah, and the T-Shirt he was wearing,
it had fine picture of PameIa Anderson.

523
01:06:05,646 --> 01:06:06,840
PameIa Anderson.

524
01:06:10,886 --> 01:06:12,524
Singh uncIe Ioved me a Iot.

525
01:06:13,966 --> 01:06:15,558
Thanks,
Sister-in-Iaw.

526
01:06:16,286 --> 01:06:18,083
He was reaIIy a great man.

527
01:06:18,966 --> 01:06:20,445
He knew about us.

528
01:06:21,446 --> 01:06:23,721
In fact he made sure
Vikram proposed to me.

529
01:06:24,926 --> 01:06:27,565
Oh, reaIIy.
You owe him a big one.

530
