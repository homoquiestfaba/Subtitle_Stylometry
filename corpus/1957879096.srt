1
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,980
(alarm beeping)

2
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,788
(siren blaring)

3
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,665
(traffic zooming)

4
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,872
(horn honking)

5
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,915
(car alarm blaring)

6
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,323
(melancholy music)

7
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,032
(tense theme music)

8
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,435
(tense music)

9
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:14,053
- It's been there for almost 150 years.

10
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:18,224
Remains of a city asylum, smallpox quarantine.

11
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,393
They'll take only three days to raze the place,

12
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,695
clear it out to make way for the temple ruins.

13
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,265
Strange, I guess.

14
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,000
Replacing one set of ruins with another.

15
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,735
'Course, the site we're installing

16
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,670
is thousands of years old.

17
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,373
Compared to that, 150 is just a speck in time.

18
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,777
Sometimes I wonder how you do it.

19
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:41,180
I show up and go on and on about nothing but myself.

20
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,248
- Anna, you're in therapy.

21
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,616
That's what you're here for.

22
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,652
- Still, I feel like I should let you go

23
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,254
and get on to some interesting patients

24
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:51,858
with real problems, someone at least suicidal or something.

25
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,693
- Just because you're not suicidal, Anna,

26
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,762
I don't think any less of you.

27
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:56,596
- Thanks, Doc.

28
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,434
So, the bulk of the site should be here soon,

29
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,536
two weeks, I think, and then we start

30
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:04,604
the reconstruction of the temple

31
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:05,738
which should take three months.

32
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:06,739
- Oh, wow.

33
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,007
That sounds very exciting.

34
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,409
Must be looking forward to that.

35
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,811
(clock ticking)

36
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,313
- Yeah, I am.

37
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,182
- But you know, I think we really should be discussing

38
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:19,519
where your marriage is headed.

39
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,853
Don't you think?

40
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,357
- I guess.

41
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,793
(horn honking) (crashing)

42
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,594
- [TV Announcer] Service interruptions while Telecom

43
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:30,229
strike negotiations are deadlocked.

44
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,497
- [Man] Fuckin' train wreck.

45
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,732
- [TV Announcer] Mobile phone service providers

46
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,434
are claiming the resulting overload

47
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,602
on the cell network may push sporadic--

48
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:37,537
(thudding) - Jesus!

49
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,439
Did you hear about Collegeman?

50
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,907
- What?

51
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,542
- You know, Collegeman, that little fuck over at, uh,

52
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,410
Weissman, Shooks and Nunyet?

53
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,678
- Yeah.

54
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,979
- Yeah well, last night, Collegeman

55
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,148
is running to catch the express,

56
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,518
and perhaps unjustly begins to leave without him,

57
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,688
so he jams his briefcase in the door.

58
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,190
Now, regardless of this action, the train

59
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,491
begins to move down the platform.

60
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,094
He starts running after it, yelling, screaming,

61
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,563
protesting, finally manages last minute,

62
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,732
yanked the briefcase out but his tie

63
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,700
is still caught in the door.

64
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,601
He can't get his tie out.

65
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,002
His tie is caught.

66
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,173
Fuckin' took his head off at the end of the platform.

67
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,308
(siren blaring)

68
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,209
Took his head

69
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:17,977
right off.

70
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,015
Cheap bastard's probably wearing a rayon tie.

71
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,718
Silk one, 100% silk would have ripped,

72
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,621
separated nicely, he would have been...

73
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:32,191
But no, Collegeman had to save a couple of bucks

74
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,693
on a double cock-sucking knit tie

75
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:37,130
and the fucking I.R.T. took his head right off.

76
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,898
I mean, right off.

77
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,969
(phone ringing)

78
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,039
Dropping like fuckin' flies out there, Philip.

79
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,642
We're upon the path that's becoming clearer

80
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:50,843
every day, you know what I'm sayin'?

81
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,245
- Yeah, he should have worn another tie.

82
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,080
- Yeah well, whatever.

83
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,349
Beer?

84
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,183
- I don't know, you know?

85
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,785
I just feel like...

86
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,721
Feel like we were different people back,

87
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:04,657
I feel like, well, I feel like we're different people now.

88
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:05,925
I don't know, I feel like, you know,

89
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,160
maybe everybody's a different person

90
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,561
from moment to moment and then--

91
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,463
- I think we should just leave that one alone,

92
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,330
don't you think?

93
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,133
(phone ringing)

94
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:14,967
'Scuse me.

95
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:16,869
Hello?

96
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,105
Uh, yes, yes.

97
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,206
Just a moment, please.

98
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,777
Now, I could do this,

99
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,914
how's Thursday for you?

100
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,116
- Naw, I just, I'll have water.

101
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,384
- 'Scuse me, barkeep?

102
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,885
Can we get a scotch and water for the gentleman

103
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,287
and I'll have another one of these brown betties.

104
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,122
Thanks very much for your help.

105
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,591
(chattering)

106
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,127
- Ever wonder where the water you drink comes from?

107
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,328
- I'm having beer.

108
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,596
- Fine all right, you ever thought about

109
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,898
where the water that you shower with comes from?

110
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,534
- What, the reservoir?

111
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,303
- No, no, I'm talking about before the reservoir.

112
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,471
I mean, do you realize that the water that you shower with

113
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:54,240
might have been used by someone else?

114
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,441
- All right.

115
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:56,676
- Yeah, some guy might have taken a bath

116
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:57,877
in the River Ganges or something and then

117
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,145
it evaporates up into the atmosphere

118
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,280
and then it rains down into the reservoir

119
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,216
and then it comes out of your tap.

120
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,817
- Can you make that scotch straight up, please?

121
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,086
- John, I'm talkin' about molecules.

122
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:10,189
Like, dollar bills or something.

123
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,657
- Used water.

124
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,592
- Like somebody on the other side of this planet

125
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,394
has touched these molecules.

126
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:16,929
- I don't give a fuck.

127
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,899
- Someone, somewhere totally different might have been...

128
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,269
made of these molecules.

129
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,540
I think I'm having an affair.

130
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,808
- What.

131
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:29,609
What?

132
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,412
- I'm seeing this woman.

133
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:37,216
- Now, we were discussing the changes

134
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,151
in your marriage, weren't we?

135
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,386
- Yeah, I just, I think we

136
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,622
covered that last week, didn't we?

137
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:43,556
- Anna.

138
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:44,724
- Yeah, okay.

139
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:45,958
I just don't, you know, I don't even know

140
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,193
that's there's a problem, actually,

141
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,060
and I don't want to be alarmist or anything

142
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,161
over a small issue.

143
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:49,996
- Uh huh.

144
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:53,566
- I'm seeing someone.

145
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,503
(traffic zooming) (siren blaring)

146
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,705
I'm seeing someone else.

147
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,007
- Oh.

148
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,676
(clock ticking)

149
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,880
What exactly do you mean by seeing someone?

150
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,949
- I've gotten involved with another man.

151
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,751
- And you call this a small issue?

152
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,220
- Well.

153
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,555
- She Asian?

154
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,489
No what, wait.

155
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,924
- No, she's not Asian.

156
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,225
- Is it that little chickie on the sev, holy shit.

157
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,793
It's that little chickie on the 17th floor?

158
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,429
That little tomato on the 17th floor?

159
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,131
- It's not.

160
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,133
- Every single fucking guy on the 22nd floor,

161
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,168
I even started, they even started a pool

162
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,436
to see who's gonna be the first and you--

163
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,704
- It's not some chickie on the 17th floor.

164
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,106
I don't even know who you're talking about.

165
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,608
- It's not the tomato on the 17th floor?

166
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:36,442
- No.

167
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,779
It's someone else.

168
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:40,613
- I'm sorry to hear that.

169
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,048
That's too bad.

170
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:46,385
- Anna you have been married for seven, eight years

171
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,690
and do you really consider having an affair

172
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,358
with another man small issue?

173
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,927
- No, I,

174
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,162
I guess--

175
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,230
- Well, unfortunately, we have to stop now,

176
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,568
but I think we should discuss this next time.

177
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:03,603
Definitely yes.

178
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,041
- Phil, you guys used to have

179
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,679
something really, you know,

180
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,581
really, together,

181
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:20,920
really happening there, I mean, that was really quite

182
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,090
exemplary.

183
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,960
- Seems like another life now.

184
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,763
(chattering)

185
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:31,564
- Who is she?

186
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,267
- Some other woman.

187
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,938
Just someone else.

188
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,008
- Does Anna know?

189
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,780
(tense music)

190
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,570
(somber music)

191
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,813
(faint shouting)

192
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,772
(tense music)

193
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:19,732
- Hey, Sheila.

194
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:20,599
- Hey, Anna.

195
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:25,004
Jeff, your sister's here to see you.

196
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,472
- Really?

197
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,575
Send the most beautiful girl in the world right in.

198
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,576
- Thank you.

199
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:34,446
- [Jeff] Anna.

200
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,247
- [Anna] Hi.

201
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,081
- How are you?

202
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,583
- [Anna] I'm good, good.

203
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,285
- Such a nice break from all this stuff to see you.

204
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:40,786
Why the surprise?

205
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:41,720
- I don't know.

206
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,855
I ain't seen ya in a while.

207
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:43,889
Thought it'd be nice.

208
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,091
You know?

209
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:46,825
- Everything's okay, right?

210
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:47,760
- [Anna] Yeah.

211
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,261
- [Jeff] How's your shitheel?

212
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,131
- Don't make me defend him, okay Jeff?

213
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,566
I'm not in the mood lately.

214
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,767
- Really?

215
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,368
What's the model husband been up to lately?

216
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,337
- [Sheila On Machine] You guys, sorry.

217
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,672
Jeff, it's them on two.

218
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,472
(stammering)

219
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:01,707
- Sorry, hold on.

220
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,075
Yeah, put 'em on.

221
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:04,476
Hello?

222
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:05,844
Yes, Jack.

223
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,246
How are ya?

224
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,814
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about something

225
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,616
my people heard from Frank's people.

226
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,520
Those are not the figures we discussed, I believe.

227
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:16,956
No.

228
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,290
No, no, nobody's calling it that.

229
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,892
I think one of your people

230
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,193
might have slipped up somewhere.

231
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,462
(mumbling on phone)

232
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:24,530
No.

233
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,731
(chuckling)

234
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,132
Hey, you know I have nothing but the highest

235
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,134
regard for your people, but my people...

236
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:31,971
Wait, whoa, whose people?

237
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,173
No, no, no, his people never...

238
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,174
Wait, your people?

239
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,042
Whose people?

240
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:37,943
Hey!

241
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:38,777
(popping)

242
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:39,979
Look.

243
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,247
Lemme just get back to ya.

244
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,048
I got a big thing all over me, here.

245
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:45,284
When?

246
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:46,585
No, that's not gonna work.

247
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,588
Nope, that's impossible.

248
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:50,422
Hey!

249
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,792
Look, why don't you just have one of your people

250
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,561
get something out to my people outlining

251
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,962
when would be an acceptable point

252
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,297
to initiate a dialogue.

253
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,565
Jack, please.

254
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,100
Talk to me before you talk to Frank

255
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,835
because if he talks to...

256
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:03,802
(mumbling on phone)

257
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:04,637
Right.

258
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,805
Right, right.

259
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,309
- [Anna] Jeff, what do you do here?

260
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,011
- [Jeff] I work all goddamn day.

261
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,479
- [Anna] But what do you do?

262
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,915
- Make money for this goddamn company!

263
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:18,183
- What do you actually do?

264
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:18,984
I mean, when you get here in the morning,

265
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,252
what is it you do?

266
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,422
- Just get on the phone, generate correspondence.

267
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,923
- You generate correspondence?

268
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:26,258
- That's right.

269
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,793
- What do you talk about with these people?

270
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,595
Like, for example, what were talking about with that guy?

271
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,397
- Just trying to negotiate on what grounds

272
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,299
to have a meeting over drinks.

273
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,634
- You're trying to decide which restaurant to go to?

274
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,536
- Yeah, you could put it that way, yeah.

275
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,772
- And what would you discuss at this meeting?

276
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,407
(stammering)

277
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,976
- A lot of disagreement and shuffling papers.

278
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,945
I mean, usually we disagree first on exactly

279
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:48,947
which papers to shuffle and then

280
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:50,949
when we determine which papers are acceptable

281
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:53,919
to all parties, we just hah!

282
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,020
(popping)

283
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,255
Shuffle 'em.

284
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:57,423
- You certainly are making quite a bit

285
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,524
of headway in this office.

286
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,059
- Yeah well, someone's gotta do it.

287
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,694
Look, despite your interpretation,

288
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,228
I am a little busy here and I know

289
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,864
you didn't stop by to talk to me about this shit, so,

290
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,232
what is it?

291
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:08,467
What?

292
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,301
How's things with the model marriage?

293
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,703
What's goin' on?

294
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:11,637
- Nothing, you know.

295
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,871
We don't do anything.

296
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,873
Just sorta sit alone in the same room.

297
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,309
- Good, well I'd rather hear that than some

298
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,845
vile scene of him rubbing his naked sweatiness against you.

299
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:20,679
- All right, Jeff.

300
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,181
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

301
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:25,050
Listen, my lunch opened up, so let's grab a bite.

302
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,285
What do you say?

303
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,953
'Cause I wanna talk about this stuff.

304
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,154
- Okay.

305
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:29,988
- Okay, hold on.

306
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,893
Hey, you didn't cancel the table at Flotsam, did you?

307
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,028
- [Sheila On Speaker] No, not yet.

308
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:36,862
You want me to?

309
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:37,863
- No, no!

310
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,264
Anna and I will take it.

311
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:43,168
Fantastic, this is the hottest place in town for lunch.

312
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,937
You're gonna love it.

313
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,773
(traffic zooming)

314
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,812
It's nice, huh?

315
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,514
Took two months to get this table.

316
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:57,483
- It's lovely.

317
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,419
- [Chef] Go the fuck away, I told you that.

318
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,887
Why dishes are fucking coming out cold?

319
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:04,089
'Cause you are not serving them fast.

320
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:04,957
- No, I am serving them.

321
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:05,958
You are not hearing.

322
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,226
Where's Tommy, huh?

323
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:07,893
Tommy was supposed to be here today.

324
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:08,827
Not my entree.

325
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,029
- [Chef] Go the fuck away.

326
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:10,829
- [Waiter] You're giving me a very bad,

327
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:11,630
stop pointing at me.

328
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,564
- [Chef] Or what?

329
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:13,499
- [Waiter] Stop pointing at me.

330
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,199
- [Chef] Take it out the bitch.

331
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,033
Go on!

332
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,704
- Don't you think you coulda thought about this stuff

333
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,273
seven years ago before you married him?

334
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,341
- It's 10 years.

335
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:25,911
I've been with him 10 years, since we were in school.

336
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:29,047
- And it's taken you 'til now to realize he's a schmuck?

337
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:31,817
Jesus, I mean, you shoulda listened to me back then.

338
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,685
I mean, you should be out, you know?

339
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:34,520
Just out there.

340
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,354
- Out? Out where?

341
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:36,555
Playing the field?

342
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,456
- No, no.

343
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,426
I wouldn't want you to be doin' that, it's just,

344
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,728
I don't know, I just, I think you really

345
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,430
blew it with this guy.

346
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,498
- Okay, that's it?

347
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,233
That's the choice I have to make?

348
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,635
What guy to sell myself to?

349
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:50,903
It's like I'm a lee, sound like I'm one

350
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,471
of your goddamn papers being shuffled around

351
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,672
from schmuck to schmuck.

352
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:54,973
- Hey, all right, Anna, I wish there was

353
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,241
some way I could help, but up 'til now

354
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,143
I haven't been given the authority to change Phil

355
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:59,845
into a real person, but uh, you know,

356
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,915
I'll get a man on and see what we can come up with.

357
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,116
Hey.

358
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,451
Waiter, hah!

359
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:06,685
(popping)

360
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:08,153
- [Waiter] Yes, sir, yes, yes sir.

361
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:09,721
- This fork, one of the uh...

362
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,192
- That would be a spline.

363
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,426
That's what that is.

364
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,328
- Yeah, smart guy, one of the splines is bent.

365
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:17,896
- Yes, I see that.

366
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:19,098
- Do you realize what could happen

367
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,299
to your insurance rates here if someone

368
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,067
jabbed themselves with a crooked spline?

369
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,001
Through the fuckin' roof, I assure you.

370
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,102
- Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, it's okay.

371
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:25,337
- Hah! (popping)

372
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,605
- [Waiter] Please do not touch me.

373
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,840
- Sorry-- - Hah!

374
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,507
- Can we just have another, please?

375
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:29,174
- [Jeff] Hah!

376
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:29,942
(popping)

377
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,876
- Yes, ma'am.

378
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:31,777
- Hey, fuckin' dare he oughta.

379
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,611
Hah, so for--

380
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,545
- Jeff, Jeff--

381
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:34,346
- [Jeff] Goddamn splines.

382
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,714
- It's a utensil.

383
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,185
- I'm sorry, you're right.

384
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:43,088
Anyway, we were talking about Phil.

385
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,090
- I don't know.

386
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,425
We don't talk very much.

387
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,259
Anymore.

388
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,963
I don't know what he does.

389
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:51,964
- What?

390
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,433
- We don't really talk lately.

391
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,834
(traffic zooming)

392
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,002
- What the hell do mean?

393
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,937
Is that bastard fuckin' around on you?

394
00:18:58,937 --> 00:18:59,771
- I don't know.

395
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,106
I can't be sure.

396
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,641
- Oh, that fuckin' scumbag.

397
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,109
That really--

398
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,677
- Jeff, Jeff, I don't know that that's actually correct, so.

399
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:06,678
- I swear if he's, hah, God.

400
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:07,613
I swear, if he's fuckin' around--

401
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:08,780
- Please, please, please relax.

402
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,581
I hadn't even thought about it and now

403
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:10,249
it's making me sick.

404
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,049
- Shitheel.

405
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,050
I will, I will hah!

406
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,285
- Please, you're making me crazy.

407
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,086
- I will irreparably fuck him up, Anna.

408
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:14,620
- Stop, stop, stop.

409
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,354
Relax.

410
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,188
- Hah!

411
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,022
- Jeff!

412
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:17,856
- No, you relax Anna!

413
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:18,790
- Stop it!

414
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,058
- Relax, relax, fuck, sorry!

415
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:20,726
- Stop it, Jeff, please, please, please, please.

416
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:21,260
- [Jeff] Sorry!

417
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,194
Relax!

418
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:23,128
- [Anna] Geez please, relax.

419
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,296
- [Jeff] Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

420
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,697
- Stop! - Sorry!

421
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:29,034
- Stop fucking apologizing for it, sit down.

422
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,903
Jesus, come on.

423
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,206
You have got to start taking your goddamn medication.

424
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,341
That shit is way outta hand.

425
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,576
You know, I know-- - I wanna know--

426
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:38,810
- I knew you weren't gonna be any help.

427
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,045
I don't even know what the fuck I'm doing here.

428
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:42,648
- I wanna know if he's dickin' you around.

429
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:43,982
The thought of him doin' that and then

430
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:44,917
comin' home and sweating on you

431
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,451
makes me fucking nauseous.

432
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:47,286
Hah!

433
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,120
(popping)

434
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,954
- Jeff.

435
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:49,788
(popping)

436
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:50,622
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

437
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,724
I didn't mean, look.

438
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,159
I'm gonna--

439
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:54,960
- No, you know what, you're not gonna do anything.

440
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,894
Don't do anything, okay?

441
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,129
I can take care of myself.

442
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:58,764
I don't need you driving me further

443
00:19:58,764 --> 00:19:59,998
out of my fucking mind. - I just wanna know

444
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:00,866
and then we can do something about it.

445
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,234
- Jeff, please.

446
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,069
Listen, if there's any trouble like that,

447
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,003
just forget it, okay?

448
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,939
Everything is fine, I'm fine.

449
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,106
Just forget it, please.

450
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,207
(tires squealing) I gotta go.

451
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:10,075
- Anna.

452
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:11,310
Anna!

453
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,913
(excited chattering) (horns honking)

454
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,415
- [Man] Dumb shit!

455
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,922
(uptempo music)

456
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,695
- Wait a minute, it's tines, not splines.

457
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:30,529
It's tines.

458
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:31,363
Hey!

459
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:32,698
Waiter!

460
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,934
(tense dramatic music)

461
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,873
Look up Anna's husband's office for me, please.

462
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:51,683
- [Sheila On Speakerphone] I got him on line one

463
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:52,684
but he's left for the day.

464
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:53,952
Can I give him a message?

465
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,187
- No! No!

466
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,154
I just wanna know where they were again.

467
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:57,756
Don't leave any message.

468
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,058
- Oh, um sure, all right.

469
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:03,195
(tense dramatic music)

470
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:08,767
Here's the address.

471
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,269
- Hey, did you say he was out for the whole day?

472
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:14,539
- [Sheila] Yeah, they said he's out and to leave a message.

473
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,644
- Out for the whole day, huh?

474
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:21,146
(tense music)

475
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,033
- Hey, I had to threaten to sue to get these tickets, baby.

476
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,903
Goddamn, fuck I hope we don't miss this fight.

477
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:19,137
Oh fuck.

478
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,405
- Well, you were the one late meeting me here.

479
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,107
- Yeah well, you're gonna thank me, man.

480
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,610
This is just what you need to take the edge off.

481
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,647
After the fight, Atlantic City, no windows,

482
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:32,351
no clocks, drinks on the house all night long.

483
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,852
- Great.

484
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,421
You're the one actually paying $4,000 for a dozen drinks.

485
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,223
- So, have two dozen.

486
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:39,958
Listen, you gotta loosen up okay?

487
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,827
We are in for some serious battering tonight.

488
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,261
What is the problem with you?

489
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:48,133
- I think I'm losing my wife.

490
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,102
- Why do you say that, Phil, huh?

491
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,137
Is this marital rift a little wider

492
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,039
than we previously assessed?

493
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:54,873
- I don't know.

494
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:55,841
- What's goin' on?

495
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:56,908
She playin' someone sock?

496
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:57,876
- Well.

497
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,077
- Ooh, that little vixen.

498
00:22:59,077 --> 00:22:59,911
She is.

499
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:00,679
- I didn't say she was.

500
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:01,513
- Who is it?

501
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,447
Huh?

502
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:03,381
Don't tell me, it's her shrink.

503
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,549
I hope she's fuckin' her shrink.

504
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,184
It's costing you $600 a week.

505
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:07,519
Measures must be taken.

506
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,255
We need to nip this in the dick.

507
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:11,690
You want some helpful advice?

508
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,924
(blades whirring) (mumbling)

509
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,160
all hopped up on Zoloft (mumbling),

510
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,228
before you know it, your medicine cabinet

511
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,930
looks like some kinda E.R.

512
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,134
We have to take measure against this fuckin' parasite!

513
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,068
You hear me?

514
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,269
Watch your, watch your head.

515
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,738
Hey sweetheart, how you doin'?

516
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:30,976
- I never met the guy, but I don't think it's her shrink.

517
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,044
She never even talks about him.

518
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:36,047
- Who the fuck is it, huh?

519
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,082
Do you have an idea?

520
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,250
- Well...

521
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,652
(chattering)

522
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:45,857
- What?

523
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:46,691
What?

524
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,261
- Well...

525
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,329
- [Woman On Speaker] No smoking.

526
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:54,166
- Found a cigarette butt at home.

527
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:57,335
(mumbling on speaker)

528
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:05,610
- Phil.

529
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:10,715
Sheez.

530
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,085
This is it.

531
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:18,123
Phil, I'm sorry man.

532
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:21,693
I shoulda told you a long time ago.

533
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:22,994
I'm just a fuckin' coward.

534
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:29,634
She and I have...

535
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:37,843
Ah!

536
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:40,078
(laughing)

537
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:43,882
Nothing?

538
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,553
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

539
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:52,123
That's not very funny, really.

540
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:53,325
(laughing)

541
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,427
The look on your face was priceless.

542
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:56,995
You were like, ooh.

543
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,465
- Christ, you're a jerk.

544
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,200
You wonder why I don't talk to you about this shit.

545
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,101
- Okay, I'm sorry.

546
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:06,271
It is not funny, it's serious.

547
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,740
What kind of smoke was it?

548
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:14,980
- Dunhill, I think.

549
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,548
- Oh man.

550
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,617
Your wife is fuckin' some guy that smokes Dunhills?

551
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:19,951
I am sorry.

552
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:20,919
Must be her shrink.

553
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,388
- [Captain Over Speaker] We're sorry, folks,

554
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:25,991
but it's rush hour up here, too.

555
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:28,126
We're lookin' at a little delay before takin' off,

556
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,528
so as soon as traffic allows, we'll get moving.

557
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,164
- Take a shit on me.

558
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:34,933
We're gonna miss this fuckin' fight.

559
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:38,236
(excited chattering) (faint whooping)

560
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:41,439
Okay, Anna may be gettin' full filter

561
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,308
from cigarette boy here, okay?

562
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,076
There's no reason you guys have to end up in court

563
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:46,611
messin' around with a bunch of cocksuckers like me.

564
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:47,445
I have an idea.

565
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,349
Some gentlemen at my firm who deal in this kind of...

566
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:55,553
shit

567
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,124
sometimes use this guy who's very hot right now.

568
00:25:59,124 --> 00:25:59,958
He's a P.I.

569
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:00,759
- A what?

570
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:01,860
- Private investigator.

571
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,828
Private investigator.

572
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:07,232
Best people pay top dollar okay,

573
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,201
to have this guy go and look in on their spouse.

574
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:11,002
No, listen.

575
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:14,139
The best people.

576
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:15,407
I think he could really help you out.

577
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,209
- No, no, no.

578
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:19,377
- Why not?

579
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:19,978
- I don't need that sort of stuff.

580
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:20,912
- Why?

581
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:21,813
- I can handle this on my own.

582
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,048
- Phil.

583
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:25,183
Some fuckin' supermorph is pounding your wife

584
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:26,985
into your sheets and snuffing his cigarette out

585
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:27,852
in your little Snoopy cup and you don't

586
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,054
want to know about it?

587
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,422
- Hey, can you not talk about it like this?

588
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,157
Can we just dismiss the whole issue, please?

589
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,425
- Dismissed.

590
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,827
(chattering)

591
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,231
You're just gonna obsess about it though.

592
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,199
You know it.

593
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,734
I know you.

594
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:45,704
Phil, you have got to stay on top of all things around you.

595
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:46,972
You know what I'm saying?

596
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:51,042
Enough bullshit, okay?

597
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,412
I don't like to see you like this.

598
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,181
Even I'm concerned about you.

599
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,785
You are of no use to anybody 'til you get this shit--

600
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:04,055
(creaking) (blades whirring)

601
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:07,125
(excited chattering)

602
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,363
Hey, hey, hey!

603
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,164
(mumbling)

604
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:16,001
(blades whirring)

605
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,372
What the fuck?

606
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,941
- [Captain Over Speaker] Well, folks, we just,

607
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,276
I think we almost made the front page of the Post.

608
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:26,911
Sorry about the whoopsie-daisy.

609
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:28,380
We figured everything out up here,

610
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,915
but we missed our take off now so we're

611
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:33,118
looking at another little delay, sorry.

612
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:33,952
- Oh!

613
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:40,525
Jesus H. fucking goddamn cocksucking Christ!

614
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:42,093
What are these ass clowns doing up there?

615
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,062
Wha, gonna miss this fuckin'--

616
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:45,764
- We coulda fallen off the edge of this building.

617
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:47,732
- [John] Spilled my beer all over myself.

618
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:48,967
I'm Schlitzed.

619
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,201
- We could've, we coulda been smushed.

620
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,236
- We coulda fuckin' been there by now.

621
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,404
We coulda.

622
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:53,571
Ringside, that's where we coulda been.

623
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:56,207
- I gotta-- - What are you doin'?

624
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:57,142
- Get outta here.

625
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,543
I gotta get off this thing.

626
00:27:58,543 --> 00:27:59,911
- Phil, hey, hey, listen, hey take it easy.

627
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,279
Pull it together, will you?

628
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,148
- I'm being totally serious here, John.

629
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:04,115
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

630
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:05,517
Enough of this horseshit--

631
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,451
- You are not understanding me, John, all right?

632
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:07,852
- Hey, oh, all right, all right.

633
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:08,787
Rope it in okay?

634
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:09,821
Look, hey, we're takin' off.

635
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,556
- No, no, no, no!

636
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:12,424
Gotta get off!

637
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:13,291
Please!

638
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,125
I gotta get off!

639
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,060
- Okay, whoa.

640
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,794
Hold it, hold it, all right.

641
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,395
Hold it.

642
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:18,563
Miss, waitress, can you,

643
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,565
my associate, help me out.

644
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:24,069
(talking over each other)

645
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,871
- Sir, is everything all right?

646
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,373
- Okay, okay, let's, come on.

647
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,008
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

648
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,476
- It's all right, all right.

649
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,278
You're gettin' off, you're gettin' off for Christ's sake.

650
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,846
- [Man] Just throw him off.

651
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:37,082
- Okay, which one's having a seizure?

652
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:38,216
- [John] Uh no, ace, listen.

653
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,684
Everything's under control here.

654
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:42,454
We just need to get this gentleman out of here, okay?

655
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:43,288
- Fine.

656
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:44,222
Get him outta here.

657
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,790
- [John] Yes, sir.

658
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,725
Okay, here we go.

659
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:47,926
- Feel like a total asshole.

660
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:48,860
- It's all right, don't worry about it.

661
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,794
We're all okay, thanks a lot.

662
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:50,995
Sorry folks, nothin' to see.

663
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,163
- 'Preciate it, John.

664
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,098
- All right, all right, you're a bundle

665
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:54,332
of fuckin' nerves, all right?

666
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:55,667
Do me a favor, listen, I'm gonna call that guy

667
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:56,501
that I'm talkin' about.

668
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:57,469
- No, no, don't do that.

669
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,504
Just, just forget about it.

670
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,139
- Listen, take a few days off, okay, please.

671
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,341
You're making me fuckin' nervous.

672
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:06,177
(blades whirring)

673
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:14,953
Let's go, let's go, let's get this baby airborne.

674
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,455
(tense music)

675
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:22,260
(clattering)

676
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,094
- Hey.

677
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:25,463
What are you doing here?

678
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:26,431
I thought you were supposed to be in Atlantic City.

679
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:29,467
- I had a rough day, I decided not to go.

680
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,103
- Ah.

681
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,105
Oh.

682
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:38,276
- Can I come in?

683
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,412
- It's a real mess.

684
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:42,347
Can you--

685
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:43,548
- Can you let me in my house?

686
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,885
- I didn't clean up, that's all.

687
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:47,886
You're gonna be horrified.

688
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:48,720
- Horrified?

689
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:50,488
I'll bet.

690
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:52,891
What the hell's going on here?

691
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,425
- It's just a real mess, Phil.

692
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,361
- What, are you hosting a rodeo in our living room?

693
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,195
- [Anna] Phil.

694
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:58,029
- Let me in.

695
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:58,963
- Please.

696
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,665
- Anna, open the goddamn door.

697
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:03,168
(tense music)

698
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,108
Expecting someone?

699
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:13,645
What the hell you doing?

700
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,813
- I thought they might make me feel better.

701
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,283
- Feel better?

702
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,285
- Yeah, I lit candles, Phil.

703
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,053
Jesus, it's been hard on me lately, too, you know?

704
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,354
This reconstruction project--

705
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:24,822
- [Phil] Demolition, you mean.

706
00:30:24,822 --> 00:30:25,990
- [Anna] You know, please stop calling it that.

707
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,027
What's wrong with you?

708
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:29,861
You look sick.

709
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,864
Hey, what are you doing?

710
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,601
- [Phil] Nothing.

711
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:40,538
I'm sorry.

712
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:44,042
(tense music)

713
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:50,548
Sorry, I had a rough day, that's all.

714
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:52,951
- What happened to you?

715
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,419
(water rushing)

716
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,921
- I'm just, endless meetings at the office all day.

717
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,591
- Sounds miserable.

718
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,327
- Oh, I don't know.

719
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,736
Spending the whole day locked in hermetically sealed

720
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:13,805
cubicle under fluorescent lights,

721
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,508
listening to guys yell numbers at each other,

722
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,211
these huge numbers.

723
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,048
Such unbelievably large numbers.

724
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,322
- Why don't you stop doing it?

725
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,059
- What do you mean?

726
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,061
- I mean, why don't you do something else?

727
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:40,732
- I can't just do something else.

728
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:41,666
- Why not?

729
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:44,435
- Anna.

730
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:46,471
This is our life.

731
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:50,675
What, you think I can just suddenly shift who I am?

732
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:51,909
- Why not?

733
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:53,244
- Anna, what the fuck you talkin' about?

734
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:56,047
It's easy for you to say.

735
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,615
You're sitting around all day long

736
00:31:57,615 --> 00:31:59,984
waiting for a barge full of rocks to show up--

737
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:00,918
- What?

738
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:01,853
- I'm out there dragging my ass.

739
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,021
- Whoa, whoa, that's what I do.

740
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,423
- What, digging up some archeological site

741
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,457
to be sent here--

742
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:07,292
- Hey, hey.

743
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,293
- Stuffed in a museum--

744
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:09,527
- Hey.

745
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:10,194
- Some centerpiece for the cocktail party.

746
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:10,762
- Phil, stop.

747
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:13,965
We can't be this way.

748
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,334
This is killing us.

749
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:20,238
- Well, learn to live it.

750
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,108
- Come on, games aren't helping anymore.

751
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,176
They're consuming us.

752
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:27,378
- Games?

753
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,885
- Phil, do you know how scary it is

754
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,119
to think about your life so far

755
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,622
and have to stop because it bores you so much?

756
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:40,425
It's the next to worse feeling in the world

757
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,160
and do you know what the worst is?

758
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,461
- I have an idea.

759
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,829
- It's to see the rest of your life

760
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,864
and know exactly what it will be,

761
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,900
and to be so bored by that you can't stand it

762
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,401
and you can't stand it so much you're dying

763
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,136
to be someone else.

764
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,105
Phil, that's the scariest feeling in the world

765
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:55,940
and it's the way I feel all the time.

766
00:32:58,109 --> 00:32:59,577
- Do you want a divorce, Anna?

767
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:02,747
- What?

768
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:03,981
You're not even hearing me.

769
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:05,583
You're not listening to a word I'm saying.

770
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:06,884
- You could have someone else.

771
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:08,853
- That's not the point.

772
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:11,356
Phil, I feel like we're both just waiting for something

773
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,624
and these games aren't helping.

774
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:14,892
- These games.

775
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:17,395
(tense music)

776
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:24,635
Anna, are you seeing someone?

777
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,940
- Oh Jesus, Phil, please, please, please

778
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,609
stop for a moment and just be with me, okay?

779
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,279
- What do you mean, how?

780
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,114
- What do you mean how?

781
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,281
You don't remember?

782
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:39,117
- Who are you talking about?

783
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:40,952
- Us.

784
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:43,721
You don't remember us?

785
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:44,555
- Who?

786
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:46,557
- Oh Phil, please.

787
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,694
I'm really lonely like this.

788
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,196
Aren't you lonely?

789
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:55,500
- Never really think about it.

790
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:59,137
- [Anna] Please.

791
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,805
- [Phil] Please what?

792
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:03,307
(tense music)

793
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,944
- I don't know.

794
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:10,782
It's nothing, forget it.

795
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,284
(tense music)

796
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,271
- [Hal On TV] The crews will tear down

797
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:34,472
the (mumbling) ruins to make way

798
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,073
for the (mumbling) reconstruction project

799
00:34:36,073 --> 00:34:38,176
that should begin by this week.

800
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:39,310
Martin?

801
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,012
- [Martin On TV] Thank you, Hal.

802
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,481
Meanwhile, at City Hall, officials say injuries (mumbling).

803
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,818
(tense music)

804
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,519
could number in the hundreds but insist

805
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,188
the count could have been much higher

806
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:51,856
had officers not been (mumbling).

807
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:55,493
About 2,000 angry sanitation workers

808
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:58,095
gathered for a rally demonstration (mumbling).

809
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,239
But serious injuries were sustained by picketers

810
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,208
once tear gas was employed.

811
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:14,846
(whistle blowing)

812
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,347
- Black out, brown out, whatever.

813
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:18,216
The power's back up.

814
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,017
Guess we gotta go through with this, huh?

815
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:21,252
- Just because you said we're meeting

816
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,453
with this guy doesn't mean I'm gonna hire him.

817
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,387
- Hey, let's just see how it goes, okay?

818
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,122
Then we can make a decision.

819
00:35:25,122 --> 00:35:26,324
- What's this we stuff?

820
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,925
I didn't realize you'd married her, too.

821
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:29,494
- No, I did not and that's a good thing.

822
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:30,428
Hey, how you doin'?

823
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:31,596
We're here to see Lou Jordin.

824
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:33,331
- Yes, of course.

825
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:34,165
Right this way.

826
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,369
- [John] Can I get a couple of vodka tonics, no lime?

827
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:39,637
- [Maitre'd] I'll send your waiter.

828
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,205
- [John] Yeah okay, no lime, all right?

829
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:42,039
No lime.

830
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:45,543
Hey, Lou, how are ya?

831
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:48,579
I'd like to introduce my client, Mr. Milrad.

832
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:52,183
- Monsieur Milrad, how do you do?

833
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:54,685
(tense music)

834
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:57,688
- Mr. Jordin.

835
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:00,925
I have to admit, I was a little reluctant

836
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,393
about this meeting.

837
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:04,195
- Yes, I can understand this.

838
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:06,464
(laughing)

839
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,500
- Seems to me a strange recourse to have--

840
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,702
- Mr. Milrad was a little uncertain about

841
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:14,105
retaining your services (mumbling).

842
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,973
I've assured him repeatedly that

843
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:17,441
within your particular field,

844
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:19,911
your effectiveness is unmatched.

845
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:22,113
- 'Scuse me, fellas, Lou, you look great.

846
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:24,248
Just wanna tell ya I really appreciate

847
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:26,050
the way you handled that thing.

848
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,518
- [Lou] Oh not at all, of course.

849
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,554
- I appreciate it.

850
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,822
This guy, he's the best.

851
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:34,158
(chuckling)

852
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,662
- Monsieur Milrad.

853
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,132
How can I be of service?

854
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,203
- Well, to tell you the truth, I don't know.

855
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,404
- Let me help.

856
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:48,306
Phil, here, has been disturbed lately

857
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:52,376
over the possibility of extramarital activity

858
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,711
on the part of his wife.

859
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,545
- Yes.

860
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,614
Yes.

861
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:01,052
Monsieur Milrad, I must be clear at you, okay?

862
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,654
I'm not in a business of merely documenting

863
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:06,657
the illicit affairs of an unhappy marriage, okay?

864
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:09,794
- Well, I don't understand.

865
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:12,930
- My services go beyond the realm of

866
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,166
simple surveillance.

867
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,667
(speaking foreign language)

868
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:20,905
- Lou here, offers a slightly different kind of approach.

869
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:22,974
- What I do is...

870
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,247
I correct the problem, okay?

871
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,815
Not merely expose it.

872
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:35,886
- I'm sorry, Mr. Jordin, but could you excuse

873
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,922
my attorney and me for a moment, please?

874
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:38,789
- What?

875
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,224
What?

876
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,626
- Okay.

877
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,227
- Gimme a second, will ya?

878
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:45,896
(beeping)

879
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:47,064
(water rushing)

880
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:48,733
Phil, what the fuck are you doing?

881
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:50,368
I don't think you wanna piss this guy off.

882
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:51,302
- No kidding.

883
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:52,303
(mumbling) with a hit man.

884
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:53,237
- Oh come now.

885
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:54,472
- Who the hell is this guy?

886
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:55,806
Does he think I want to have my wife shot?

887
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:57,475
Crazy (mumbling).

888
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:58,476
- Listen, will you relax?

889
00:37:58,476 --> 00:37:59,677
His manner may be a little odd,

890
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,412
but he is the hottest in town.

891
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:02,446
- The hottest what?

892
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,347
Assassin?

893
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:04,882
- Come on.

894
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:08,552
Look, all he's saying is that his angle is a little steeper

895
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:10,454
than snapping a few photos of your wife

896
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,889
with some prick on a street corner, okay?

897
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:14,659
This guy is about remedy, not record.

898
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:16,394
That's what you want.

899
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:21,399
He employs surgically precise applications of intimidation.

900
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:23,534
Are you with me?

901
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:26,170
Negative motivational tactics in the interest of his client

902
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,139
in order to rectify a situation.

903
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,440
- John, this is getting really weird.

904
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,341
I think I'm through with it.

905
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:31,175
- Phil, Phil, listen.

906
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:32,410
What, all right.

907
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:35,112
What he does is stop the problem by scaring

908
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:37,148
the other guy away and nudging your wife

909
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:37,982
back into line.

910
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,216
- This is bullshit.

911
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:40,618
The guy's a thug and I'm not gonna get

912
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:41,852
involved with this stuff. - This is not like

913
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:43,054
hiring Joey No Thumbs, okay, from downtown

914
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,021
to break some guy's clavicles okay?

915
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,222
It is a lot more sophis,

916
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,926
it is a lot more sophisticated and discreet than

917
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:50,695
(laughing)

918
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:51,529
I mean...

919
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,899
The man is downright debonair goddammit.

920
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:57,635
(laughing)

921
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,704
He's a class act, man, except for his teeth,

922
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:01,072
he has an accent.

923
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,442
(laughing)

924
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,010
- Christ, you're weird.

925
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,179
- Come on, come on, let's go talk to him

926
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,847
and see what happens.

927
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:10,981
He's from Europe.

928
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:11,816
- You're weird.

929
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:12,783
- Come on, I don't see.

930
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:21,525
(mumbling)

931
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,794
(foghorn bellowing)

932
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:25,029
Listen, I apologize.

933
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,065
My client needed a little counsel.

934
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:30,468
He's still slightly hesitant about this.

935
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,403
- I understand, look, Monsieur Milrad,

936
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:33,637
I am a professional, okay?

937
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:35,106
I'm not playing games here, okay?

938
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:36,707
- Yes, okay.

939
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,043
- Perhaps if your situation becomes intolerable

940
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,311
we make a contract.

941
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:43,881
But please,

942
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:48,185
please don't waste my fucking time okay?

943
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,388
(tense music)

944
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,422
And your time, too.

945
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,360
- I don't think anybody's trying to waste anybody's time.

946
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,797
Mr. Milrad's just unfamiliar with your methods.

947
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,298
I think I think it's very possible

948
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:03,934
that we'll draft an agreement that we all find acceptable.

949
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,705
- Let me ask you a question, Monsieur Milrad.

950
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,841
Does the notion of your wife in bed

951
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,343
with another man bother you?

952
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:15,079
(tense music)

953
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:15,913
- What?

954
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,617
- Does the image of your wife making love

955
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,986
to another man, okay, locked together,

956
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,288
slick with sweat, crying out his name,

957
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:25,723
does this image...

958
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,761
Disturb you?

959
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:35,766
(tense music) (faint moaning)

960
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,369
- Phil?

961
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:39,236
- [Lou] Does this image--

962
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:41,272
- Does that image--

963
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,808
(faint moaning)

964
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,442
does that disturb you?

965
00:40:45,442 --> 00:40:48,112
(moaning)

966
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,680
- What kind of fucking question is that?

967
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,348
- Phil.

968
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:52,983
Hey Phil, let's go easy okay?

969
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:55,386
Hey, let's just try to answer Lou's questions.

970
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,189
- That's some kind of fucking question.

971
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,658
- Perhaps you like the idea, I don't know.

972
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,226
Perhaps it's a big, sexy thing for you.

973
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:03,427
I don't know.

974
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:08,332
- Yes, the notion does disturb me quite a bit, yes.

975
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:09,967
- Okay.

976
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:13,170
If your wife were to be doing something like this,

977
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,572
would you want it to continue?

978
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:15,706
- 'Course not.

979
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,443
- Does your wife smoke?

980
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:21,245
- What?

981
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:24,748
- Does your wife smoke?

982
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:25,950
- No, she doesn't.

983
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,785
- And you don't smoke either, do you?

984
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,622
Does your wife's psychotherapist smoke

985
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:34,358
the particular brand of cigarette that you have discovered?

986
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,761
- You told him that?

987
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:40,898
- Phil, Lou's services are in pretty high demand here, okay?

988
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,666
I had to make it clear that you weren't

989
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:46,036
just some jealous husband with an overactive imagination.

990
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:50,841
- Monsieur Milrad, we live in a disposable society.

991
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,309
Even marriages are disposable.

992
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:55,946
It's almost as easy as throwing out

993
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:57,815
your old air-conditioner.

994
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:00,117
(chuckling)

995
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:06,891
- I don't want to dispose of anything.

996
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:09,927
- This is where I can help you.

997
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:11,996
- All right, well, in an effort to avoid

998
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:14,565
wasting your time, Mr. Jordin,

999
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,368
I will have to think about it

1000
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,169
before I have anybody's office broken into.

1001
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:21,171
- Hey, hey, hey, let's go easy on that kind of language.

1002
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:22,006
What are you doing?

1003
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,474
- I'm leaving.

1004
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:26,277
Mr. Jordin, it has really been something, meeting you--

1005
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:27,444
- Phil--

1006
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:29,146
- But to be perfectly honest with you,

1007
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:31,749
I can't imagine that your services would prove productive--

1008
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:32,683
- Phil.

1009
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,251
- So, thank you for your time.

1010
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:36,287
John, I'll speak to you later, goodbye.

1011
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,357
- Poor, stupid bastard.

1012
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:42,493
- [John] Can I get a cigarette now?

1013
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:43,694
- [Lou] Please.

1014
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:45,229
- He'll come around.

1015
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,932
- [Lou] Yes, when he's up to his ass in cigarette butts.

1016
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:52,036
(exciting chattering)

1017
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,352
(traffic zooming)

1018
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:10,854
(tense music)

1019
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:01,065
- So, I'm starting to think,

1020
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:02,666
I know that this sounds ridiculous--

1021
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:04,168
- Uh, excuse me a minute.

1022
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:06,036
I have to close this.

1023
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,271
(speaking foreign language)

1024
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:08,705
(excited chattering) (traffic zooming)

1025
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:11,608
- Well, I just keep getting the feeling that maybe

1026
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:12,676
I'm being followed.

1027
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,580
- You know, these demonstrations are really

1028
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,948
getting out of hand.

1029
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:23,821
Anna, I know what you've been extremely bored lately

1030
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:26,190
and I just feel that you must

1031
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,825
try to keep yourself rational.

1032
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:29,393
- I know, I mean, I know.

1033
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,228
It sounds silly, but I really have been getting

1034
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,396
that feeling lately and I'm sure

1035
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,364
that I keep seeing this man wherever I go.

1036
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:37,668
That sounds dumb.

1037
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:39,870
- It sounds like perhaps you're feigning paranoia

1038
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,271
to justify your being here.

1039
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:43,874
- Well, I know what you're saying

1040
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:44,808
and I really don't think,

1041
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:45,843
why are you calling me paranoid?

1042
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:47,177
- I'm not calling you paranoid.

1043
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:48,846
I'm saying that perhaps you think that paranoid

1044
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:50,914
is an interesting thing to be.

1045
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:54,918
Anna, we're here to discuss some other issues.

1046
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,287
- Oh no, I don't wanna go into all that crap again.

1047
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:59,756
I really don't feel like talking about Phil.

1048
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:00,991
- I was not talking about him.

1049
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:02,893
You know who we are talking about

1050
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:05,295
and it does not directly involve him.

1051
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:08,899
- Oh yeah.

1052
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:11,635
Yeah.

1053
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:14,872
(phone ringing)

1054
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:15,873
- Excuse me, hel--

1055
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:16,740
oh.

1056
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,144
(staticky mumbling)

1057
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:20,978
Just a minute.

1058
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:22,146
I'll be right back.

1059
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:23,347
Consuela!

1060
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:25,082
(siren blaring)

1061
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:27,518
(tense music)

1062
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:29,253
(faint yelling)

1063
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:32,089
(traffic zooming)

1064
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:39,830
(subway clacking)

1065
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:42,332
(tense music)

1066
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:54,378
(excited chattering)

1067
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:09,226
- Jesus.

1068
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:11,995
(mumbling on P.A.)

1069
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,664
- [Man On P.A.] Across the platform.

1070
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,265
Through the doors.

1071
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:17,267
Everyone step in please.

1072
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:19,102
- You gotta let me use the phone, man.

1073
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:20,037
- Sorry, man.

1074
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:20,971
- What do you mean, sorry?

1075
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:21,905
You gotta let me use the phone!

1076
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:23,307
This is a fucking emergency!

1077
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:24,508
(mumbling)

1078
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:25,709
- Okay, let's just work out some kind of

1079
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:27,211
aggregate figure then we can talk about

1080
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:29,746
consequential damages after that (mumbling) whatever.

1081
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:30,581
(phone ringing)

1082
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:31,415
Uh huh.

1083
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:32,616
Right.

1084
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:33,917
Why?

1085
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:35,319
That's what I'm talking about.

1086
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:36,787
Uh huh, hold on.

1087
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:37,621
Shit.

1088
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:38,822
Yeah.

1089
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:39,923
Noice, go.

1090
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:41,258
- Hello?

1091
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:42,459
- I'm takin' a bath.

1092
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:44,127
Gettin' fuckin' harpooned here.

1093
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,196
- My cell phone is (mumbling).

1094
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,297
- [John] She's gonna fuckin' buy!

1095
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:48,232
- Gotta use the phone!

1096
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:49,166
- John, is that you?

1097
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,467
(talking over each other)

1098
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:51,301
- The phone!

1099
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:52,135
- Speak!

1100
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:53,203
- John?

1101
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,037
- Go.

1102
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:54,872
- God.

1103
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,073
- Is that you, John?

1104
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:56,874
It's me, it's Phil. - Come on, man.

1105
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:57,407
- No Phil here, bye bye.

1106
00:47:57,407 --> 00:47:58,408
- No!

1107
00:47:58,408 --> 00:47:59,209
It's me, Phil! - What, Phil?

1108
00:47:59,209 --> 00:47:59,876
- [Phil] I'm Phil!

1109
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:00,644
- Hold on, Mom.

1110
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:01,445
Phil?

1111
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:02,646
Hey, Phil!

1112
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:03,580
- John, don't dick me around, all right?

1113
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,748
I'm in the fuckin' I.R.T.

1114
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:05,716
- You're being a fucking asshole!

1115
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:06,650
- Leave me alone, man!

1116
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:07,784
- You're being an asshole.

1117
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:09,052
- You're at a phone booth?

1118
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:09,753
Hey man, cellular's back-- (buzzing)

1119
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:11,288
Ow!

1120
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:12,122
Belly up.

1121
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,024
Phil.

1122
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:14,958
- Listen, I'm in trouble here.

1123
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:16,159
- Hey, what is the problem?

1124
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:18,028
- Did you hire that guy without telling me?

1125
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:18,862
- Who?

1126
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:19,863
Who, Jordin?

1127
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:21,498
- Because I'm concerned here.

1128
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:22,399
I'm really, really concerned.

1129
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,333
- Okay, okay, listen.

1130
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:24,534
Hold on just a second.

1131
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:25,869
Could be better, could it be better?

1132
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,371
Come on, Mr. Chairman.

1133
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:28,905
Could you come over here and fuck me in the ass, okay,

1134
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:29,840
and then take my wallet--

1135
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,341
- John, John--

1136
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:34,611
- I did have a preliminary discussion with Jordin, okay?

1137
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:37,347
I have retained him preliminarily in your name

1138
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:39,149
by proxy as a gift to you, okay?

1139
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:40,384
- Don't (mumbling).

1140
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:42,319
There was a helicopter.

1141
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:46,356
Helicopter, it was an accident.

1142
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:47,824
- Go baby, go baby.

1143
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:50,560
(excited chattering)

1144
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,796
Please, I'll be really quick.

1145
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:54,331
- Is there any reason that he would

1146
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:55,332
have somebody tailing me?

1147
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:56,900
- Why, what do you mean?

1148
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,368
Go baby.

1149
00:48:58,368 --> 00:48:59,102
- They're following me and I'm really spooked here, John.

1150
00:48:59,102 --> 00:48:59,937
- Go baby, go.

1151
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,171
Who is it?

1152
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:02,406
- I don't know, that's what I'm asking you for.

1153
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:03,340
- Well, how the fuck am I supposed to know?

1154
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,041
Come on baby, come on baby.

1155
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:04,875
Come on baby.

1156
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:05,709
- John, look, you got--

1157
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:06,543
- Come on baby.

1158
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:07,377
- John you--

1159
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:08,211
- Come on baby.

1160
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:09,046
(mumbling)

1161
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:09,880
Yeah!

1162
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,081
You mother fucker.

1163
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:12,316
- John, you got me into this shady bullshit,

1164
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:13,417
now tell me what to do.

1165
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:14,885
(stammering)

1166
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:16,820
- Hey listen, I'm your broker, not your bodyguard, okay?

1167
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:17,654
You gotta relax.

1168
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:18,822
- Don't tell me that.

1169
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:21,758
(mumbling)

1170
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:22,993
- Okay, listen, listen.

1171
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:24,261
You're sounding hysterical, okay?

1172
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:26,063
There's no reason Jordin had you followed, okay?

1173
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:27,364
Phil?

1174
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:28,799
- Gotta go, John.

1175
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,167
- Phil?

1176
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,301
Phil?

1177
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:32,703
Phil?

1178
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:33,537
Phil?

1179
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:34,371
- [Jeff On Phone] Hello?

1180
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:35,305
- Hello?

1181
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:36,039
- [Jeff On Phone] This you?

1182
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:36,873
You little slut.

1183
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:38,041
- Who?

1184
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:38,842
- [Jeff On Phone] Whore, whoever you are.

1185
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:40,043
- Who is a whore?

1186
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:41,244
- You better forget about lover boy,

1187
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:42,045
because I'm about to break his goddamn neck!

1188
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:42,913
- Hey!

1189
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:44,014
Hey, company line.

1190
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:45,449
Hey, hey, hey.

1191
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:47,617
- Find you and I'm gonna burn your fuckin' house down.

1192
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:50,220
- Company line, company line, watch your language, buddy.

1193
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,388
- Slut!

1194
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:52,322
- [John] Hey, watch your language.

1195
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,490
Company line, you (mumbling).

1196
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,324
- Slut!

1197
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:55,492
- Fuck you, pal!

1198
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:59,129
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, pal.

1199
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:01,498
And lemme say how mother fucking dare you!

1200
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:02,833
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?

1201
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,434
I'm a professional!

1202
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:05,836
Huh?

1203
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,405
Hello?

1204
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:09,806
Hello?

1205
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:11,241
Jesus.

1206
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:12,442
(phone ringing)

1207
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:13,477
The tomato's married.

1208
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:17,748
(tense dramatic music)

1209
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:23,220
- [Phil] Help me!

1210
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,054
Help!

1211
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:26,923
Help me!

1212
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:27,758
Help me!

1213
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:31,261
Help me!

1214
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,029
Help me!

1215
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:35,232
Help!

1216
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:42,472
(thudding) (groaning)

1217
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:53,817
- Sleazebag, (mumbling) sleeps with my sister, huh, huh?

1218
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:56,186
(yelling over each other)

1219
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:57,254
Fucking kill you--

1220
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:59,022
- Crazy, man!

1221
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:03,427
(thudding) (grunting)

1222
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:06,430
(excited chattering)

1223
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:07,364
- [Man] Man.

1224
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:09,933
Ladies, what are you doing?

1225
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:11,935
Are you kidding me?

1226
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:16,940
(excited chattering) (sirens blaring)

1227
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,185
(chattering)

1228
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,923
(breathing heavily)

1229
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:49,139
- Could you send this to room 1132 please?

1230
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,776
- Oh yes, Ms. Johnson's room.

1231
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,111
- Yeah, yeah, right.

1232
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,879
- [Clerk] Yes sir, have a nice day.

1233
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:57,247
- [Phil] I have other plans.

1234
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:04,688
- Excuse me, sir.

1235
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:07,057
Excuse me, sir, he's in a very important meeting right now.

1236
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:08,458
You can't go in there.

1237
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,693
(excited chattering)

1238
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:11,528
You can't go in there!

1239
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:15,732
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1240
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:18,869
Carry on the negotiations without me.

1241
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:20,136
Thank you, Diana, way to hold the fort.

1242
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:21,071
- [Receptionist] My name's not Diana.

1243
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:22,038
- Phil, I'm working here.

1244
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:23,473
Hey, what happened to your face?

1245
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,641
- The guy that was following me caught up with me.

1246
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,842
- Holy shit.

1247
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:27,077
Listen, I wanted to talk to you about that.

1248
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:28,812
Now, I had a little chat with this charmer

1249
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:29,813
on the phone, okay?

1250
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,581
Your other little indiscretion,

1251
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:34,718
this is her husband, okay, or her squeeze or something.

1252
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:36,553
The guy's a little off somehow.

1253
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:38,622
He was quite unreasonable on the phone.

1254
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:41,525
I feared he was gonna do something rash, which,

1255
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:42,759
you all right?

1256
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:44,227
You look like a two dollar steak.

1257
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:45,295
- Thanks, I feel stupendous.

1258
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:46,530
Look, John.

1259
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:47,697
This shit has got to stop, all right?

1260
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:49,766
The whole thing is getting way out of hand.

1261
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:51,167
- How is that my fault, huh?

1262
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:52,869
You might wanna reconsider your involvement

1263
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:54,137
with this Asian chick.

1264
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:55,605
- I'm talking about this fucking frog.

1265
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:57,140
The whole thing is making me nervous.

1266
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,375
Let's just put an end to it, all right?

1267
00:52:58,375 --> 00:52:59,876
- What are you worried about Jordin for?

1268
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:02,779
- Look, I explicitly told you not to retain him.

1269
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:03,713
Besides that--

1270
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:04,648
- Okay, Jordin is going to--

1271
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:05,882
- Would you just listen to me?

1272
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:06,750
The thing is getting severely out of hand.

1273
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:07,918
- Okay, okay, listen.

1274
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:08,752
- All right.

1275
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:10,253
- Hey, hey, hey.

1276
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:11,621
You are the one who needs to stay on top of this, okay?

1277
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:14,224
Of all things at all times now, all right?

1278
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:16,159
Without me cradling your balls at every step.

1279
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,527
Christ, I'm your accountant,

1280
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:20,630
not your fuckin' marriage counselor, okay?

1281
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:21,798
What do I help you with?

1282
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:23,033
- I didn't, I never asked you to--

1283
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,234
- I know.

1284
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:25,168
- So, I'm gonna go away for a few days--

1285
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:26,403
- Good.

1286
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:27,637
- And I don't want to be worrying about

1287
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:28,838
who, whether I'm gonna come home--

1288
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:30,106
- You pull your shit together, okay,

1289
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:31,841
and everything will work out fine, okay?

1290
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:33,109
Pull your shit together.

1291
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:34,311
Everything will work out fine, all right.

1292
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:35,745
If I were you, I'd forget about you know,

1293
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:37,147
whoever she is, because obviously,

1294
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:40,183
her other little pull toy is a little,

1295
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:41,618
little displeased.

1296
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:43,887
I gotta get back to the second party of the first part.

1297
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,389
Call me when you get back, all right?

1298
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:49,259
(excited chattering)

1299
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:51,928
All right, all right, all right.

1300
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,098
(thudding) All right!

1301
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:56,466
Jesus, I step out for one moment

1302
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:58,268
and you guys get all confused.

1303
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:04,908
- [Anna] Hey, what are you doing home?

1304
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,543
- I'm sorry.

1305
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:07,877
Did I interrupt something?

1306
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:08,812
- [Anna] No, you just startled me.

1307
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:10,247
What happened to your face?

1308
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,148
- Oh, nothin', just (mumbling).

1309
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:15,819
- [Anna] You okay?

1310
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:18,221
- Yeah, yeah, I just, stupid accident on the subway.

1311
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:19,222
- You sure?

1312
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:20,223
- No, but...

1313
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:21,124
- My God.

1314
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:23,860
You're all right?

1315
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,794
- Yeah.

1316
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:25,929
- This, that came for you today.

1317
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:30,500
Someone you know staying there?

1318
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,168
- What?

1319
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:33,403
What?

1320
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:34,804
- The hotel the stationery's from.

1321
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:35,739
Who's staying there?

1322
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:37,207
Is that a friend or business?

1323
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:39,909
- Um...

1324
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:42,078
Business.

1325
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:44,748
(tense music)

1326
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:45,582
Wait.

1327
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,283
- Wait, what?

1328
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,219
You look confused.

1329
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:50,353
Are you sure you're okay?

1330
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:55,992
- Where did you get this from?

1331
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:58,628
- I told you, somebody dropped it off in the mailbox.

1332
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,999
- Oh.

1333
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:05,502
(tense music)

1334
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:12,676
If you ever stand me up again,

1335
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:14,244
I'm going straight to your wife.

1336
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:16,379
I refuse to be hidden away any longer,

1337
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:17,947
like the mad woman in the attic.

1338
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:19,916
You will meet me at Il Iaccahammero

1339
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:21,584
tomorrow night at 10 p.m.

1340
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:22,886
Don't disappoint me.

1341
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:23,920
The other woman.

1342
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,522
I can't do that.

1343
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:26,356
- [Anna] Hmm?

1344
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:27,624
What's the matter?

1345
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:30,126
(tense music)

1346
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,263
- I uh...

1347
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:34,531
- [Anna] Is something wrong with you?

1348
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:35,899
What's, is it bad news or something?

1349
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,868
- No.

1350
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:39,703
No.

1351
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:47,477
(clacking)

1352
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:48,745
(chattering)

1353
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:49,946
- [Woman] It is so fucking hot out.

1354
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:51,581
- [Anna] What the hell's going on here?

1355
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:53,550
- The heating system went berserk this morning

1356
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,285
and he won't let me go home.

1357
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:56,119
- [Anna] Oh, God.

1358
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:57,354
How's he takin' it?

1359
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,722
- Well, he didn't come in 'til after lunch,

1360
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:00,156
so he hasn't had a full day of it,

1361
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:02,592
but I'd be careful right now.

1362
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:03,993
- [Anna] He didn't get in 'til after lunch?

1363
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:04,828
- Nope.

1364
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:07,664
- 25,675.

1365
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:09,833
28,774.06.

1366
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:13,169
740.86.

1367
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:14,971
729.84.

1368
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:15,805
Hah!

1369
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:17,974
25,660.9.

1370
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:19,809
- Christ Jeff, you've gotta open a window at least.

1371
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:20,643
- Hold on, hee!

1372
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:21,644
They don't open.

1373
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:22,479
Hee!

1374
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:23,313
(popping)

1375
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:24,147
'Scuse me, Steve.

1376
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:25,682
I gotta go.

1377
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:26,616
Callin' back, hah!

1378
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:27,917
- Fucking ignite in here.

1379
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:28,952
- [Jeff] Told you they don't open.

1380
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:30,186
It's all glass.

1381
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:32,589
It's like a goddamn aquarium in here.

1382
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:33,423
(popping)

1383
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:34,357
Sorry!

1384
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:35,291
- Don't start with that stuff.

1385
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:36,226
Don't apologize every time.

1386
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,427
This is unbearable in here.

1387
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:38,762
- [Jeff] Yeah well, I'm fine, okay?

1388
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:40,063
- Jesus.

1389
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,531
- [Jeff] What, what is it Anna,

1390
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:42,966
'cause I got a ton of shit I gotta get done here.

1391
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:43,900
Chill out!

1392
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,034
Hah!

1393
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:46,503
Where the hell are the...

1394
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:47,670
- Top drawer.

1395
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:48,738
Top drawer.

1396
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,341
- Oh, chill out, chill out!

1397
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:52,642
Not these, the uh...

1398
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,645
- [Sheila] Have you checked up your asshole?

1399
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:56,613
- Hey, hey, hey!

1400
00:56:56,613 --> 00:56:57,447
Hey!

1401
00:56:57,447 --> 00:56:58,281
- Hey, hey, Jeff!

1402
00:56:58,281 --> 00:56:59,115
(thudding)

1403
00:56:59,115 --> 00:56:59,949
Jeff.

1404
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:02,285
Calm down, okay?

1405
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:03,620
Not everybody works as well under

1406
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:04,587
adverse conditions as you do.

1407
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:05,822
Let her go home already.

1408
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:07,690
- Anna, what do you want?

1409
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:08,958
- I came to ask you something.

1410
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:10,226
- What?

1411
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:11,161
Can't you see I'm fuckin' busy here?

1412
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:12,095
- Where were you this morning?

1413
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,029
Why did you come in late?

1414
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:14,330
- Meeting, meetings, meetings.

1415
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:15,732
Get off of me.

1416
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:16,733
Hah!

1417
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:17,567
- Look.

1418
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:21,237
Today, Phil came home, okay.

1419
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:22,839
- Oh, really, the shitheel actually came home.

1420
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:24,707
Now, that, I mean (stammering).

1421
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:25,909
- Jeff.

1422
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:26,576
- To see the measure of devotion a man can--

1423
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:27,710
- Jeff, stop.

1424
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:28,311
- Takes your fuckin' breath away.

1425
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:29,145
- Stop.

1426
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:30,346
- Hey, hey, I got it!

1427
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:32,549
- It looked like someone beat him up.

1428
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:34,751
- Oh, even better news.

1429
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:36,719
- Did you do something to Phil?

1430
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:37,921
- Me?

1431
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:39,389
Hey, I love the guy like a fuckin' brother.

1432
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:41,391
Why would I wanna harm a hair on his little pinhead?

1433
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:42,625
- Jeff.

1434
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:43,793
I asked you to stay out of my business

1435
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:45,361
and you end up pasting my husband?

1436
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:46,596
What is that?

1437
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:47,397
Who the hell do you think you are?

1438
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:48,064
My fucking father?

1439
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:49,532
- Hey! Hey!

1440
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:50,767
If I were Dad I wouldn't give a rat's ass about you,

1441
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:52,268
so don't, don't, don't come in here

1442
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:54,003
and attack me for caring about how you piss your life away.

1443
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:56,406
- Oh, would you rather I piss it away on somebody else?

1444
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:57,540
- Yeah, anybody.

1445
00:57:58,508 --> 00:57:59,509
Look, Anna.

1446
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:02,479
I watched him for a couple days and uh...

1447
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:04,881
I saw...

1448
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,318
I wasn't gonna tell you but,

1449
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:14,357
I saw him with someone else.

1450
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:16,559
- What?

1451
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:19,929
- I watched him meet another woman.

1452
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:22,832
I mean, you wanted me to let you work it out for yourself.

1453
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,969
- You saw Phil with another woman?

1454
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:28,571
- Yeah, at a hotel.

1455
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:30,506
I know you didn't want me to, but I had to.

1456
00:58:30,506 --> 00:58:31,441
Did it for you.

1457
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:32,909
Look, I know hah!

1458
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:34,143
(popping)

1459
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:35,511
I know I shouldn't have, but Anna.

1460
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:37,981
I'm sorry.

1461
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:39,916
I know this must be

1462
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:43,019
really tough for you.

1463
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:47,257
For some reason, hah! Hah!

1464
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:48,091
Hah!

1465
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:50,326
I'm sorry.

1466
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:52,629
- What did she look like?

1467
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:53,863
- What?

1468
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,598
- The other woman, did you see her?

1469
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:59,769
- No, not really, but you know, I mean,

1470
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:01,471
she was clearly some kind of tramp.

1471
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:03,640
- Really?

1472
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,474
- Yeah, heh!

1473
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:06,709
You get it.

1474
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:07,510
I mean, you're in another league.

1475
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:12,615
I'm sorry I had to tell you, but who better, right?

1476
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:15,151
I mean, so you can understand muh!

1477
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:17,253
My feelings about him now, can't you?

1478
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:19,756
- I don't feel so good.

1479
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:21,658
- [Jeff] Yeah, the whole thing makes me nauseous.

1480
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:23,026
Look, look how cute you were, look.

1481
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:23,860
- Actually, I feel pretty ill.

1482
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,161
- [Jeff] Look, hey!

1483
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:26,696
- I gotta go.

1484
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:27,664
- No, no, Anna don't.

1485
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:28,598
Don't cop out on this.

1486
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:30,433
We have to do something, Anna.

1487
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:32,201
Hah! Hah!

1488
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:34,103
(popping)

1489
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:34,904
Hmm.

1490
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:39,809
- Yeah, I got her leaving the brother's office.

1491
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:41,644
Should be on the way to the shrink's.

1492
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:45,081
Yeah, the shrink's out.

1493
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:47,216
No Dunhill, just a bunch of cigars.

1494
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:48,718
Nice ones, though.

1495
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:49,986
Delicious, in fact.

1496
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:52,221
Yeah, it's not the shrink.

1497
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:53,356
I can tell by now.

1498
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:54,657
- I think I'm beginning to hear what

1499
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:55,892
you're saying, though.

1500
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:57,827
Starting to realize that,

1501
00:59:57,827 --> 01:00:00,863
that maybe what I had with this other man is,

1502
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:03,599
is nothing, you know, maybe you're right.

1503
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:07,437
- Anna, do you have any idea why this would happen?

1504
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:10,540
- I think I was confronted with the reflection

1505
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,542
of what I'd been doing and I didn't like it.

1506
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:15,411
- I mean, why would anyone do this to me?

1507
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:16,379
I mean, they obliterate my office

1508
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:17,714
and only take a box of cigars?

1509
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:18,748
I mean, what is that?

1510
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:21,150
- [Anna] I don't know, it's--

1511
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:22,385
- I mean, but what's going on here?

1512
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:23,219
Everything just seems to be coming apart.

1513
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:24,454
- Well, exactly.

1514
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,455
Everything that I've built up to this point

1515
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:28,257
is crumbling and I think I see.

1516
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:29,659
I think I'm beginning to see.

1517
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:31,561
- Have you seen this man again?

1518
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:34,364
- I'm gonna see him today and I know what I have to say.

1519
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:37,033
I have to tell him it's over.

1520
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:37,867
This game--

1521
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:39,168
- Oh no, no, no.

1522
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:40,636
I mean the man who was following you

1523
01:00:40,636 --> 01:00:43,106
because I looked out that window

1524
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:45,608
and I saw a man standing on the corner

1525
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:47,610
staring up here and I thought,

1526
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:49,278
oh, he is watching this place, I mean,

1527
01:00:49,278 --> 01:00:51,581
something very strange is going on, I mean--

1528
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:53,483
- Dr. Grover, last week you ridiculed me

1529
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,852
for my pseudo-paranoia and I think you were right.

1530
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:57,653
I think it was, you know, just some sort

1531
01:00:57,653 --> 01:01:00,790
of strange expression of my own inner conflict.

1532
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:02,792
- Not, no, I mean, what does this look like to you?

1533
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:04,360
Does this look like an expression

1534
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,796
of your inner conflict?

1535
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:07,730
- I don't know, I think it's, it's--

1536
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:09,632
- I mean, look at these shelves.

1537
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:11,000
Look at my humidor.

1538
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,302
My second husband gave me that.

1539
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:15,605
(tense music)

1540
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:17,006
- Well you know, maybe I should just go.

1541
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,207
- No.

1542
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,709
You wait a minute, wait a minute.

1543
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:20,643
I wanna know about this man who's been following you.

1544
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:22,145
I wanna know what's going on.

1545
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:24,414
- What's the point of trying to talk to you about this?

1546
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:25,915
Fucking interiors are killing me.

1547
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:27,150
I've got to get out of here.

1548
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:28,017
- [Dr. Grover] Out?

1549
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:28,851
What, out there?

1550
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:30,520
Oh, oh no way.

1551
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:33,456
No way.

1552
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:35,958
(tense music)

1553
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:41,197
(breathing heavily)

1554
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:51,074
(moaning)

1555
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,711
- [Man] Is it like this with your husband?

1556
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,012
- [Anna] No.

1557
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:56,979
No.

1558
01:01:56,979 --> 01:01:58,281
- [Man] Tell me.

1559
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:00,683
- Only with you.

1560
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:01,984
Only with you.

1561
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:04,487
(tense music)

1562
01:02:33,783 --> 01:02:36,018
(clicking)

1563
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:40,289
My husband will be home soon.

1564
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:45,995
You better go.

1565
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:48,498
(tense music)

1566
01:03:13,856 --> 01:03:16,592
(rain pattering)

1567
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:37,446
(windchime clinking)

1568
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:39,949
(tense music)

1569
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:58,401
(rain pattering)

1570
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:50,019
(muffled grunting)

1571
01:04:50,019 --> 01:04:51,520
- You gotta have somebody's dick in you

1572
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,855
to make you feel like more than half a person, huh?

1573
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:53,956
Do ya?

1574
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:55,157
Because that's pathetic.

1575
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:56,626
It makes me fuckin' sick, and I'll tell ya,

1576
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:58,194
I don't think it'll make your husband

1577
01:04:58,194 --> 01:04:59,996
feel pretty good, either.

1578
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:02,431
(tense music)

1579
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:49,779
(groaning)

1580
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,381
We can do this the hard way, or the harder way.

1581
01:05:52,381 --> 01:05:53,949
(grunting)

1582
01:05:53,949 --> 01:05:55,584
(chuckling)

1583
01:05:55,584 --> 01:05:56,652
That's the hard way.

1584
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:57,887
You like that?

1585
01:05:57,887 --> 01:05:59,121
I think maybe you like that, huh?

1586
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:01,524
You're into the rough stuff, huh?

1587
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:04,026
(tense music)

1588
01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:18,307
- [TV Announcer] The finger pointing has already begun

1589
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,443
as officials try to explain why the barge

1590
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:22,345
was so far off course when it collided

1591
01:06:22,345 --> 01:06:25,614
with the other vessel, capsizing and dumping its cargo.

1592
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:27,116
- I'll just leave you with a little picture

1593
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:30,052
of your boyfriend eatin' through a tube up his nose

1594
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:31,954
held together with steel wire,

1595
01:06:31,954 --> 01:06:34,390
every tooth snapped out of his head,

1596
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:36,125
so you can clearly see me in a right tack

1597
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:37,360
for you to lay off, yeah?

1598
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,795
(mumbling)

1599
01:06:39,795 --> 01:06:41,664
Doing that boy between your legs 'cause you never will.

1600
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,432
I promise you, never.

1601
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:49,305
(weeping)

1602
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:51,140
- [TV Announcer] Started saying the 20 ton stone blocks

1603
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,908
that comprise the ancient temple,

1604
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:54,477
slated for reconstruction here,

1605
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:56,245
have sunk in the extremely deep waters

1606
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:58,114
just off the continental shelf.

1607
01:06:58,114 --> 01:06:59,615
- [Mink] And don't worry, I'm gonna have this very same

1608
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:01,650
conversation with your boyfriend.

1609
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:02,985
Ex-boyfriend,

1610
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:05,688
so you don't have to bother with any goodbyes

1611
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:07,256
and I'll be watching.

1612
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:08,424
You can count on it.

1613
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:11,827
(footsteps clunking)

1614
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:13,763
(tense music)

1615
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:16,198
(whimpering)

1616
01:07:37,853 --> 01:07:40,523
(siren blaring)

1617
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:52,668
(excited chattering)

1618
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:17,259
(staticky tuning music) (yelling)

1619
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:52,027
(retching)

1620
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:52,928
- Watch the car, okay?

1621
01:08:52,928 --> 01:08:53,929
Watch the car.

1622
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:55,364
- Yeah, yeah, excuse me.

1623
01:08:56,398 --> 01:08:57,867
Excuse me.

1624
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:00,269
(thudding)

1625
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:01,370
- Oh, fuck.

1626
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:03,405
- [John] What's goin' on?

1627
01:09:03,405 --> 01:09:04,773
- [Lou] They will be out in a moment, okay?

1628
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:05,908
Straight, here.

1629
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:07,343
- [John] I'm straight, I'm straight.

1630
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:09,044
Geez, what's takin' your man so long?

1631
01:09:09,044 --> 01:09:10,646
- He will be out, okay, he will be out.

1632
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:13,482
- He's takin' his sweet fuckin' time about it.

1633
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:15,084
Listen, I'm about to go in there myself

1634
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:16,519
and get a goddamn beer.

1635
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:18,888
- You don't want to go in there.

1636
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:20,022
- Why not?

1637
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:21,423
They got beer in there, don't they, huh?

1638
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:24,493
(yelling) (cheering)

1639
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:26,328
- Fuck me, fuck y'all!

1640
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,208
- [Man] Shit, asshole!

1641
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:41,377
(yelling)

1642
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:48,751
- What are we doing here?

1643
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:50,619
- You got my note?

1644
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:51,620
- I got your threat.

1645
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:54,423
- You feel threatened?

1646
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:55,724
- No, more like cornered,

1647
01:09:56,592 --> 01:09:58,460
but we do have to talk.

1648
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,329
- Yeah, it's a little late for that now, Phil,

1649
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:02,264
don't ya think?

1650
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:05,601
(scratchy tuning music)

1651
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:14,543
- Besides, I wouldn't mind seeing the look on her face

1652
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:16,445
when I walk in on her with this creep.

1653
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:19,114
And what a scumbag he must be.

1654
01:10:19,114 --> 01:10:20,683
Look at this fuckin' place.

1655
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:21,517
Fuckin' animals.

1656
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:26,855
- [Lou] Impressive sound system.

1657
01:10:26,855 --> 01:10:29,758
- I don't give a shit if they got a 10 jigawatt

1658
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:32,261
digital pornograph in there as long as they got a bar.

1659
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:33,095
I'll be back.

1660
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,531
- [Lou] I will be here, okay.

1661
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:37,666
- Christ all this trouble over a tomato.

1662
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:39,668
Can't believe you make a living at this horseshit.

1663
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:42,104
- Well, there is a demand, okay, and I fill it.

1664
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:44,607
Matter of simple economics, sir.

1665
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:46,508
- [John] Jeez, don't I know it?

1666
01:10:46,508 --> 01:10:49,378
- Civilization is based upon the exchange of women.

1667
01:10:49,378 --> 01:10:51,580
They are most valuable commodity.

1668
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:55,050
I function as a well, as a kind of bondsman.

1669
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:56,318
- That's fuckin' hogwash.

1670
01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:58,520
You're an overpriced hatchet man, Lou.

1671
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:01,457
But you're cheaper than any divorce litigator I know.

1672
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:03,826
You're a cost effective alternative is what you are.

1673
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:04,893
- Look, look.

1674
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,130
Look around you, Mr. Bigshot, look around you.

1675
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:10,933
Society is coming apart at the seams, okay?

1676
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:13,369
Without someone like me, soon they'll be no hope of order.

1677
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:14,203
No hope.

1678
01:11:15,638 --> 01:11:19,375
We must maintain, we must maintain or we will be lost.

1679
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:22,311
- Listen, this has got to stop.

1680
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:25,114
- What?

1681
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:25,948
- You, me.

1682
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:28,550
But,

1683
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:30,052
I can't do this anymore.

1684
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:30,953
I can't see you again.

1685
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:33,122
It's, my head is just--

1686
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,891
- What do you think you have to go back to?

1687
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:37,192
- What?

1688
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:38,027
- Your wife?

1689
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:41,664
- Yeah, I'm fucking married, remember?

1690
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:43,732
- I don't know, Phil.

1691
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,970
See, I had a little talk with your wife.

1692
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:48,771
- What?

1693
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:51,540
- She knows, Phil.

1694
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:57,413
- What are you doing?

1695
01:11:57,413 --> 01:11:58,313
- Don't you get it?

1696
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:00,082
She's left you.

1697
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:04,586
She's gone.

1698
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,723
Didn't you realize?

1699
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:11,794
(thudding)

1700
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:13,262
- You need to keep your fuckin' hands to yourself, Romeo.

1701
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:15,597
Now, we're goin' outside, have a talk right now.

1702
01:12:15,597 --> 01:12:17,866
And you, I'm very disappointed with you.

1703
01:12:17,866 --> 01:12:19,568
I thought we had an understanding.

1704
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:21,370
(grunting)

1705
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:23,005
Oh man, oh man, oh man.

1706
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:24,606
You should not have done that.

1707
01:12:24,606 --> 01:12:26,909
That's the second great fuckin' error you made tonight.

1708
01:12:26,909 --> 01:12:28,343
The first one was comin' here to meet her.

1709
01:12:28,343 --> 01:12:29,578
- Who the fuck are you?

1710
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:31,013
- I'm the last guy you're gonna look at

1711
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,315
from a standing position, you fuckin' insect!

1712
01:12:33,315 --> 01:12:34,583
Now, start movin' to the door, right now.

1713
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:36,585
- Get your fuckin' hands off me, man.

1714
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:37,953
I don't know you.

1715
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:41,957
- Last chance.

1716
01:12:41,957 --> 01:12:42,925
This is your fuckin' last chance to leave here

1717
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:44,560
on your own power, I swear.

1718
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,328
I will pull your legs right through your fuckin'

1719
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:47,830
ass in a heartbeat.

1720
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:48,664
- What is this about?

1721
01:12:48,664 --> 01:12:49,898
What do you want, huh?

1722
01:12:49,898 --> 01:12:51,166
I don't understand.

1723
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:52,634
- It's about you and your date, goddammit.

1724
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:55,137

- What the fuck is going on here?

1808
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:45,434
What the fuck are you people doing?

1809
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:46,835
- Monsieur Milrad.

1810
01:16:46,835 --> 01:16:49,938
I must apologize for Mink, I am sorry, but,

1811
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:51,406
he was acting in your service.

1812
01:16:51,406 --> 01:16:52,607
- What?

1813
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:54,042
What kind of fucking service is that?

1814
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:55,243
Christ, what is wrong with you people?

1815
01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:56,178
- Okay, Phil, listen to me, listen--

1816
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:57,579
- I can't believe you did this.

1817
01:16:57,579 --> 01:16:58,947
- Look, Monsieur Milrad,

1818
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:01,183
we were under the impression that your wife--

1819
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:03,485
- My wife, my wi, look all right.

1820
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:05,120
I don't need your fucking service.

1821
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,755
- Hey listen, mister, I followed your wife here--

1822
01:17:06,755 --> 01:17:07,689
- All right, all right, all right,

1823
01:17:07,689 --> 01:17:08,790
shut it, all right?

1824
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:09,725
Phil, listen to me.

1825
01:17:09,725 --> 01:17:10,993
Let me clear this up, okay?

1826
01:17:10,993 --> 01:17:13,295
This tower of shit here is, in fact,

1827
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:15,097
an agent of Mr. Jordin's, okay,

1828
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:17,099
and was acting within the parameters

1829
01:17:17,099 --> 01:17:19,568
outlined by the agreement I entered into on your behalf--

1830
01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:23,739
- Oh, Christ, John, just please shut up.

1831
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:25,574
You just, you talk too much.

1832
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:27,009
You've gone way too far, here.

1833
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:29,778
I've had my life threatened twice in the past week

1834
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:32,381
and you talk too fucking much, so please,

1835
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:34,950
just lemme sort my own shit out.

1836
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:42,057
- Okay.

1837
01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:44,126
Okay, gentlemen, what we have here is a minor,

1838
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:45,994
how you say, a minor snafu.

1839
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:46,828
(chuckling)

1840
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:47,663
Perhaps at this point--

1841
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:48,597
- Terminate it, okay?

1842
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:49,498
Terminate it, Lou.

1843
01:17:50,632 --> 01:17:54,136
You, your services, this giant colostomy bag,

1844
01:17:54,136 --> 01:17:57,239
all correspondence, any other fuckin' monies,

1845
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:59,341
all agreements, that fuckin' hat,

1846
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:01,176
fuckin' terminate it, okay?

1847
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:03,078
And you.

1848
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:06,181
There is just too fuckin' much of you.

1849
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:08,350
What the fuck was going through that big helmet of yours?

1850
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:09,584
- How can we perform our services

1851
01:18:09,584 --> 01:18:12,020
to the fullest extent under these conditions?

1852
01:18:13,321 --> 01:18:14,756
We need the fullest cooperation from our clients.

1853
01:18:14,756 --> 01:18:17,359
- Stop, just shut that fuckin' hole, okay?

1854
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:18,493
You're givin' me a fuckin' headache.

1855
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:20,595
- Oh, po, po, po.

1856
01:18:20,595 --> 01:18:21,963
- I don't think we uh, there's any need

1857
01:18:21,963 --> 01:18:23,532
to continue this discussion tonight, okay.

1858
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:24,766
That'll be all.

1859
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:27,335
You two can kindly go fuck yourselves.

1860
01:18:27,335 --> 01:18:30,605
Hey, your name is mud in this town, Lou.

1861
01:18:30,605 --> 01:18:31,873
I assure you.

1862
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:33,108
And don't call me, either one of you.

1863
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:35,043
You'll be hearing from my process server next.

1864
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:44,386
- Well, should I?

1865
01:18:45,987 --> 01:18:46,822
- Please.

1866
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:56,098
- [John] Hey, Phil.

1867
01:18:56,098 --> 01:18:58,767
Philip, Phil, Phil, Phil.

1868
01:18:58,767 --> 01:18:59,968
Hey, hey, Phil.

1869
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:02,437
- Please, I've had enough.

1870
01:19:02,437 --> 01:19:03,872
- Okay, listen, I'm just, I'm sorry

1871
01:19:03,872 --> 01:19:05,674
'bout that fuckin' nonsense back there, all right?

1872
01:19:05,674 --> 01:19:07,042
I'm just tryin' to help you out, man.

1873
01:19:07,042 --> 01:19:08,276
I'm just--

1874
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:09,511
- How come I don't buy that, John, huh?

1875
01:19:09,511 --> 01:19:11,480
How come it feels like it was all for you?

1876
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,714
- What?

1877
01:19:12,714 --> 01:19:13,949
- Anything you can do to feel like

1878
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:15,183
you're on top of all things around you.

1879
01:19:15,183 --> 01:19:16,585
How come it feels that way to me, huh?

1880
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:17,519
- [John] I don't know.

1881
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:18,887
- I mean, shit John, thanks.

1882
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:20,422
Thanks for the hand.

1883
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,390
You really helped the hell out of me there, you know?

1884
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:23,625
But since it's all about you,

1885
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:24,826
then maybe you're the one that needs help.

1886
01:19:24,826 --> 01:19:26,027
Take a look at yourself, would you?

1887
01:19:26,027 --> 01:19:27,262
- Hey no, I do not do that, okay?

1888
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:29,331
That I would find revolting, okay?

1889
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:31,133
I ignore, I'm good at ignoring, see.

1890
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:32,834
That's what I do, better than you.

1891
01:19:38,707 --> 01:19:40,075
- And that makes you happy?

1892
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:42,744
- Happy, what?

1893
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:43,578
What?

1894
01:19:43,578 --> 01:19:44,613
(chuckling)

1895
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:47,282
(siren blaring)

1896
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:52,220
It was you and Anna the whole time wasn't it?

1897
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:53,054
Shit.

1898
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:56,992
Jesus, you shoulda told me, man.

1899
01:19:56,992 --> 01:19:58,426
- Don't, don't, don't, don't.

1900
01:19:59,761 --> 01:20:01,229
This is about me and her.

1901
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:02,831
It's got nothin' to do with you or anybody else.

1902
01:20:07,269 --> 01:20:08,103
- Jesus.

1903
01:20:12,407 --> 01:20:13,308
I'm impressed, man.

1904
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:14,809
That is kinky.

1905
01:20:14,809 --> 01:20:16,545
You guys turned out to be pretty weird after all.

1906
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:17,913
- Weird?

1907
01:20:17,913 --> 01:20:20,482
Yeah, you dispatch this big bruiser boy

1908
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:22,350
to kick the shit outta me (mumbling).

1909
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:23,185
- Mink!

1910
01:20:23,185 --> 01:20:24,219
Mink!

1911
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:25,387
Those two fuckin' guys, man.

1912
01:20:25,387 --> 01:20:26,821
Even after that business in your apartment,

1913
01:20:26,821 --> 01:20:29,724
those two ass clowns, totally fuckin' bamboozled.

1914
01:20:29,724 --> 01:20:30,559
- What?

1915
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:31,893
- What?

1916
01:20:31,893 --> 01:20:33,562
- What business in my apartment?

1917
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:34,396
- What, the...

1918
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:37,065
Hey Phil, listen.

1919
01:20:38,533 --> 01:20:41,002
I told him that kinda shit was totally unacceptable, okay?

1920
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:41,903
When I first, when there was--

1921
01:20:41,903 --> 01:20:42,737
- Wait, wait, wait.

1922
01:20:42,737 --> 01:20:43,972
What did they,

1923
01:20:43,972 --> 01:20:46,208
was that mother fucker in our home?

1924
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:48,710
- Okay, I know it's profoundly fucked up, all right,

1925
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:50,779
but they insist it's part of some program, I--

1926
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:52,714
- What the fuck happened?

1927
01:20:52,714 --> 01:20:53,748
Did he touch Anna?

1928
01:20:53,748 --> 01:20:54,716
- No, I lick,

1929
01:20:54,716 --> 01:20:55,550
okay, I apologize, again--

1930
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:56,384
- What did you do?

1931
01:20:56,384 --> 01:20:57,352
Was Anna touched?

1932
01:20:57,352 --> 01:20:58,253
- Hey, I did not sign off on--

1933
01:20:58,253 --> 01:21:00,422
(grunting)

1934
01:21:00,422 --> 01:21:03,291
(heavy breathing)

1935
01:21:06,294 --> 01:21:09,297
(car alarm blaring)

1936
01:21:32,254 --> 01:21:33,488
- [Jeff] Hello?

1937
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:46,568
(tense music)

1938
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:52,941
(phone ringing)

1939
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:54,709
- [Phil On Machine] Hi, this is Phil and Anna's.

1940
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:56,378
Please leave a message at the beep.

1941
01:21:56,378 --> 01:21:58,713
(beeping)

1942
01:21:58,713 --> 01:22:00,815
Anna, pick up, if--

1943
01:22:00,815 --> 01:22:02,817
(coughing)

1944
01:22:02,817 --> 01:22:03,618
Anna.

1945
01:22:04,619 --> 01:22:06,221
Come on, please.

1946
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:08,723
(tense music)

1947
01:22:10,925 --> 01:22:13,295
(beeping)

1948
01:22:13,295 --> 01:22:16,064
- [Woman On Machine] You have five messages.

1949
01:22:16,064 --> 01:22:17,465
Message number one.

1950
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:20,702
- [Jeff On Machine] It's him, it's me, Jeff.

1951
01:22:20,702 --> 01:22:22,904
Listen, where the hell you been?

1952
01:22:22,904 --> 01:22:25,073
I've been calling you don't ah!

1953
01:22:25,073 --> 01:22:25,907
Fuck!

1954
01:22:25,907 --> 01:22:27,676
Please, call me back.

1955
01:22:29,177 --> 01:22:30,612
- [Woman On Machine] Message number two.

1956
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:32,147
(beeping)

1957
01:22:32,147 --> 01:22:33,381
- [Dr. Grover On Machine] Hi, Anna, it's Dr. Grover.

1958
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:35,517
I got your note and I think you're right.

1959
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:36,951
I'm taking a break myself.

1960
01:22:36,951 --> 01:22:40,522
I'm leaving my practice for a while.

1961
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:44,059
I think I'll just take a little time off and go away.

1962
01:22:45,226 --> 01:22:46,394
- [Woman On Machine] Message number three.

1963
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:47,629
(beeping)

1964
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:48,830
- [Man On Machine] Hey, are you there?

1965
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:49,631
- [Anna] Phil, I think you know what

1966
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:50,965
has happened to us.

1967
01:22:50,965 --> 01:22:52,233
I think we both realize that there's

1968
01:22:52,233 --> 01:22:54,235
no reason to go back.

1969
01:22:54,235 --> 01:22:56,871
There's nothing left, so I'm going,

1970
01:22:56,871 --> 01:22:58,673
and I don't know if I'll ever return.

1971
01:23:00,175 --> 01:23:02,477
Just know the person I was loved the person you were,

1972
01:23:03,611 --> 01:23:05,280
and that will always mean something,

1973
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:07,415
even if those voices are gone.

1974
01:23:07,415 --> 01:23:09,150
- [Woman On Machine] Message number four.

1975
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:10,652
(beeping)

1976
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:13,855
- [Jeff On Machine] Anna, hi, it's Jeff (coughing) again.

1977
01:23:13,855 --> 01:23:15,357
Wanted to talk to you but I don't know

1978
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:16,591
what happened to you.

1979
01:23:16,591 --> 01:23:18,860
Listen, (coughing) I wanted to tell you

1980
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:20,028
I quit my job.

1981
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:22,430
Sheila's filling (coughing) the position.

1982
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:24,299
I think my number was up.

1983
01:23:24,299 --> 01:23:27,335
Yeah, I was just generating ha ha!

1984
01:23:27,335 --> 01:23:28,737
(crashing)

1985
01:23:28,737 --> 01:23:31,239
(tense music)

1986
01:23:33,775 --> 01:23:35,410
(coughing)

1987
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:37,812
(clattering)

1988
01:23:40,281 --> 01:23:41,483
- Gin, up, now.

1989
01:23:43,284 --> 01:23:46,221
(faint chattering)

1990
01:23:53,161 --> 01:23:54,562
Again.

1991
01:23:54,562 --> 01:23:59,567
(horns honking) (siren blaring)

1992
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:01,503
Sequel.

1993
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:10,478
Encore.

1994
01:24:10,478 --> 01:24:13,148
(faint yelling)

1995
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:21,923
(horn honking)

1996
01:24:21,923 --> 01:24:22,757
Beer.

1997
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:28,396
(thudding)

1998
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:29,431
- Listen pal, we're closin' up here, all right?

1999
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:31,666
- Don't you fuckin' threaten me.

2000
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:32,500
- Hey,

2001
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:33,334
pal.

2002
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:34,536
These are the facts.

2003
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:36,271
It's late, it's gettin' real hairy out there

2004
01:24:36,271 --> 01:24:37,572
and I gotta close this place up

2005
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:38,973
before all hell breaks loose.

2006
01:24:38,973 --> 01:24:40,241
- Words.

2007
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:41,709
- Hey, pal.

2008
01:24:41,709 --> 01:24:43,711
- These are mere words goddammit, sticks and st,

2009
01:24:44,646 --> 01:24:46,314
while sticks and stones may--

2010
01:24:46,314 --> 01:24:47,882
- Yeah, I got those, too.

2011
01:24:47,882 --> 01:24:49,317
Now, drink up.

2012
01:24:50,985 --> 01:24:51,820
- Break my

2013
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:53,988
balls.

2014
01:24:53,988 --> 01:24:56,491
(tense music)

2015
01:25:14,108 --> 01:25:15,310
- [Phil] Are you okay?

2016
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:17,512
- Yeah, you?

2017
01:25:17,512 --> 01:25:18,713
- [Phil] Yeah.

2018
01:25:18,713 --> 01:25:19,814
Did that man hurt you?

2019
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:22,884
- What do you mean, I left.

2020
01:25:22,884 --> 01:25:23,818
- No, I mean at home.

2021
01:25:23,818 --> 01:25:25,987
I had no idea he was there.

2022
01:25:25,987 --> 01:25:27,188
I'm so sorry.

2023
01:25:27,188 --> 01:25:28,756
- You mean the man at the club?

2024
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:31,326
- No, no.

2025
01:25:31,326 --> 01:25:32,760
Wait a minute.

2026
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,429
We need to speak to each other.

2027
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:38,833
- Oh, did your wife send that guy?

2028
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:39,901
Is that it?

2029
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:42,070
(siren blaring)

2030
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:44,239
(yelling)

2031
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:49,844
(crashing)

2032
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:52,981
- Hah!

2033
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:55,483
(tense music)

2034
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:57,452
- Now it's gettin' a little blurry.

2035
01:25:57,452 --> 01:25:58,920
I mean, the wife,

2036
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,922
it's all fucked.

2037
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:02,624
Fucked up.

2038
01:26:06,294 --> 01:26:07,428
It's fucked up.

2039
01:26:09,597 --> 01:26:11,466
It's all gettin' fuckin' blurry, man.

2040
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:13,168
- All right, pal.

2041
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:14,369
Your number's up.

2042
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:15,837
Time to hit the bricks and beat it.

2043
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:16,504
- It's like we're all blurring into one another.

2044
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:17,238
I swear to God.

2045
01:26:17,238 --> 01:26:18,139
- All right.

2046
01:26:18,139 --> 01:26:19,474
Hey, Pete.

2047
01:26:19,474 --> 01:26:20,308
Come on.

2048
01:26:20,308 --> 01:26:21,175
- Hey, hey!

2049
01:26:21,175 --> 01:26:22,010
Hold it.

2050
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:23,344
Hold it, hold it.

2051
01:26:23,344 --> 01:26:25,046
Hold it, hold it!

2052
01:26:25,046 --> 01:26:26,414
Hold it.

2053
01:26:26,414 --> 01:26:27,749
(grunting)

2054
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:29,083
(mumbling)

2055
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:31,686
You guys do not stand a fuckin' chance.

2056
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:32,754
Understand me, huh?

2057
01:26:32,754 --> 01:26:33,955
Get your fuckin' hands off me.

2058
01:26:33,955 --> 01:26:35,290
You don't scare me.

2059
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:36,891
- [Bartender] Get the fuck outta here already.

2060
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:38,993
- [John] Yeah, you don't have a fuckin'...

2061
01:26:38,993 --> 01:26:41,863
(excited chattering)

2062
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:44,232
You don't have a fuckin' prayer, you know that?

2063
01:26:44,232 --> 01:26:45,633
(tense music)

2064
01:26:45,633 --> 01:26:46,734
Counselor, huh?

2065
01:26:48,403 --> 01:26:50,038
Fuck.

2066
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:52,073
(sirens blaring)

2067
01:26:52,073 --> 01:26:54,576
(tense music)

2068
01:27:17,265 --> 01:27:19,300
Can I fuckin' help you with somethin'?

2069
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,302
- [Mink] No, I'm gonna help myself.

2070
01:27:21,302 --> 01:27:22,937
(chuckling)

2071
01:27:22,937 --> 01:27:24,505
- Okay, you perfect asshole.

2072
01:27:25,974 --> 01:27:28,209
Why don't you either tell me what you need right now

2073
01:27:28,209 --> 01:27:30,745
or go fuck yourself and piss off while you're doin' it?

2074
01:27:30,745 --> 01:27:31,980
Your choice.

2075
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:33,414
- [Mink] I'll tell you what I need.

2076
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:34,849
I need you to park it right there

2077
01:27:34,849 --> 01:27:35,950
so I don't have to walk you down

2078
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:37,185
like a wounded animal.

2079
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:38,720
- [John] All right.

2080
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:39,854
I'm all yours, come on.

2081
01:27:41,289 --> 01:27:43,291
(thudding) (grunting)

2082
01:27:43,291 --> 01:27:46,561
(tense dramatic music)

2083
01:27:50,164 --> 01:27:52,834
(siren blaring)

2084
01:27:54,168 --> 01:27:56,237
- [Mink] Oh dammit, fuck.

2085
01:28:03,144 --> 01:28:04,379
(coughing)

2086
01:28:04,379 --> 01:28:07,115
(elevator music)

2087
01:28:11,352 --> 01:28:12,253
(clattering)

2088
01:28:12,253 --> 01:28:13,087
(coughing)

2089
01:28:13,087 --> 01:28:13,921
- Hah!

2090
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:16,090
(popping)

2091
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:18,059
Huh, sorry!

2092
01:28:21,696 --> 01:28:22,530
- Stop.

2093
01:28:23,665 --> 01:28:25,333
Just stop doing this.

2094
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:26,167
- Doing what?

2095
01:28:26,167 --> 01:28:27,368
- This, us.

2096
01:28:27,368 --> 01:28:28,970
- Us.

2097
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:29,971
Us who?

2098
01:28:31,472 --> 01:28:32,307
- All right, Anna.

2099
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:33,441
Come on, talk to me.

2100
01:28:34,475 --> 01:28:35,376
What are we doing?

2101
01:28:36,377 --> 01:28:37,211
How do we stop?

2102
01:28:38,212 --> 01:28:39,380
- And do what, go back?

2103
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:41,883
- [Phil] This whole thing has gotten away from us.

2104
01:28:41,883 --> 01:28:42,817
- Away from us?

2105
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:44,752
It was supposed to be for us.

2106
01:28:44,752 --> 01:28:46,954
It was supposed to be between us.

2107
01:28:46,954 --> 01:28:48,089
How could you violate that?

2108
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:49,357
You sent that man over.

2109
01:28:49,357 --> 01:28:50,658
How could you do that?

2110
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:51,926
- I didn't, I never would have.

2111
01:28:51,926 --> 01:28:53,194
Tell me he didn't hurt you.

2112
01:28:53,194 --> 01:28:54,395
- How could you bring a stranger between us?

2113
01:28:54,395 --> 01:28:55,830
- All right, let's just quit this

2114
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:57,198
and we'll go back and we'll start all over again.

2115
01:28:57,198 --> 01:28:58,466
- I'm never going back there.

2116
01:28:58,466 --> 01:28:59,767
When you sent that man, that was it.

2117
01:28:59,767 --> 01:29:00,735
- No, no, no.

2118
01:29:00,735 --> 01:29:01,903
Let's just go home.

2119
01:29:01,903 --> 01:29:03,137
- Home.

2120
01:29:03,137 --> 01:29:05,006
Place is like a fucking mausoleum.

2121
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:05,973
Home's where we've been entombed

2122
01:29:05,973 --> 01:29:07,408
since the day we got married.

2123
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:10,078
We've started to become those people,

2124
01:29:10,078 --> 01:29:12,313
those people I can't stand being for one more second.

2125
01:29:12,313 --> 01:29:13,648
- You don't like who we are,

2126
01:29:13,648 --> 01:29:15,583
so betrayal will set you free?

2127
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:16,517
- Betrayal?

2128
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:17,618
Who did I betray you with?

2129
01:29:17,618 --> 01:29:18,453
You?

2130
01:29:18,453 --> 01:29:19,487
- That's not me.

2131
01:29:21,222 --> 01:29:22,523
If you make it someone else for yourself

2132
01:29:22,523 --> 01:29:24,525
then it is and you did it.

2133
01:29:24,525 --> 01:29:27,028
It was someone else and you liked it.

2134
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:28,463
- Listen to yourself.

2135
01:29:28,463 --> 01:29:30,398
- You think you can stand being those people?

2136
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:33,601
I look in the mirror and I have to see

2137
01:29:33,601 --> 01:29:34,836
the guy who's fucking my wife.

2138
01:29:34,836 --> 01:29:37,638
- It was supposed to be exciting, Phil.

2139
01:29:39,941 --> 01:29:42,543
Even for a moment, if we could just get back.

2140
01:29:42,543 --> 01:29:43,945
- Back to what?

2141
01:29:43,945 --> 01:29:45,179
- To something.

2142
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:47,548
To feeling something, to feeling anything.

2143
01:29:51,819 --> 01:29:52,954
- Well, what are we gonna do?

2144
01:29:54,188 --> 01:29:55,189
Stay in this room?

2145
01:29:56,858 --> 01:29:58,426
It's exactly like the last one.

2146
01:29:59,594 --> 01:30:01,028
- I'm leaving.

2147
01:30:01,028 --> 01:30:02,130
- Anna, don't.

2148
01:30:03,431 --> 01:30:04,265
- Why?

2149
01:30:05,433 --> 01:30:06,667
Why not?

2150
01:30:06,667 --> 01:30:07,602
- I understand why you wanna leave.

2151
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:13,274
Believe me, I understand,

2152
01:30:14,609 --> 01:30:16,811
but if you can remember anything of me,

2153
01:30:16,811 --> 01:30:18,279
that you saw when we met...

2154
01:30:26,354 --> 01:30:27,188
Anna.

2155
01:30:28,756 --> 01:30:29,590
- Phil.

2156
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:33,227
Please I have to find a place to start over

2157
01:30:33,227 --> 01:30:36,464
because I won't make it here like this.

2158
01:30:36,464 --> 01:30:38,966
(tense music)

2159
01:30:52,914 --> 01:30:53,981
Come with me.

2160
01:30:55,216 --> 01:30:57,385
(clattering)

2161
01:30:57,385 --> 01:30:59,854
(tense music)

2162
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:20,908
(tense dramatic music)

2163
01:31:26,547 --> 01:31:28,783
(crashing)

2164
01:31:40,895 --> 01:31:43,164
(crashing)

2165
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:48,569
- Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man.

2166

2193
01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:56,337
That's the worst kind of news for you

Unless you're enjoying this horseshit.

2289
01:38:30,704 --> 01:38:32,006
One would expect a little discomfort
