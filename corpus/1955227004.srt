00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:49,910
Yes, sir.

3
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,281
We're going to view the
footage momentarily.

4
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:54,081
Yes, sir.

5
00:01:54,182 --> 00:01:55,115
I will, sir.

6
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:55,916
Immediately.

7
00:01:58,752 --> 00:01:59,887
Are we ready?

8
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:00,888
Any time.

9
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:01,955
Just hit the switch.

10
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:02,756
Thanks.

11
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:03,757
That'll be all.

12
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:04,758
We'll call when we're done.

13
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,075
You ready?

14
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:22,876
Yeah.

15
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:28,982
OK.

16
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,551

Trucker found her wandering
down the highway in a daze.

18
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:14,355
That's the girl's father, Duncan
Savage, the film's director.

19
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:30,103
Who's that?

20
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,940
It's the special effects
man, Harry Watson.

21
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,608
What's his status?

22
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:35,409
It's uncertain.

23
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,602
That's the movie's
producer, Frank Cohen.

24
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,471
His status hasn't been verified.

25
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,153

we recovered, except for this.

Savage girl's here, Chris.

00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:10,498
Good.

33
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:12,866
She's the only one that
can fill in the gaps.

34
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,034
Has she seen this film?

35
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:14,835
No.

36
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,737
Then keep it under wraps.

37
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:19,973
As of now, that
film does not exist.

38
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:20,908
Done?

39
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:23,343
Send in the girl.

40
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,445
Seal up that film and
put it back in the can.

41
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:33,887
Chris, this is a list of
the people we know about.

Come in, Kiersty.

43
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:48,468
My name is Chris Walters
and this is Mr. Stewart.

Hi.

45
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:52,706
Thank you for coming.

46
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,909
I don't really
understand why I'm here.

47
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,277
I've already talked
to the police.

48
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:00,347
I know.

49
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,015
I understand, dear.

50
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:05,953
But we need to hear
it one more time.

51
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,988
In order for us to
help you, we need

52
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:10,023
To know everything you know.

53
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,258
OK?

54
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,594
OK.

55
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:15,829
Would you care for
anything before we start?

56
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:16,697
No, Thank you.

57
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:22,469
Hold all calls.

58
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:28,709
Now, Kiersty, start at the
beginning and take your time.

59
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,911
There's no rush.

60
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,181
But please be as
accurate as you can.

61
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:39,419
We need to know every detail
that you can remember.

62
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,121
I was really excited
about spending

63
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:43,657
The summer with my dad.

64
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:46,627
I'd never been on
location with him before.

65
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:49,296
And the fact that he invited
me made it even better.

66
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,619
I remember we passed some no
trespassing signs on the way

67
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:14,521
To the location,
but dad said it was

68
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:17,157
OK, that we had
all of the permits

69
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:18,291
That we needed to shoot there.

70
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:28,368
The first few days I learned a
lot about how a film was made.

71
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:31,338
Everyone was real nice.

72
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:34,608
They all knew so much
about me, I felt like I

73
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,544
Had known then all my life.

74
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:40,547
Was there anything strange
going on between the cast

75
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:43,016
And the crew?

76
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:46,620
Just what you read in the
newspapers in the supermarket.

77
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,555
The man who was
playing the father

78
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:50,724
Was really sleeping
with the actress

79
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:53,727
Who was playing the daughter.

80
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:56,964
Busy, my ass.

81
00:09:57,064 --> 00:10:01,635
What kind of bullshit
scene is this anyway?

82
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:04,004
Sav's never written so
much mushy shit before.

83
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,541
It's not that bad.

84
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,644
I think it's essential
for my character to show

85
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:12,112
His true love for his daughter.

86
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:21,689
You wouldn't know what would
be essential to a god damn shoe

88
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,897
And by the way, stop
standing in my light.

89
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:34,101
Bad enough you can't act,
but don't ruin my close ups.

90
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:36,837
And stop trying to direct me.

91
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:41,675
I'm sorry.

92
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:43,944
I didn't mean it.

93
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,478
All right.

94
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,414
Just don't do it again.

me, I'll keep you happy.

A lot of that on the set?

99
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,661
No.

100
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:37,130
At least I don't think so.

101
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,833
Mr. Cohen would get real
mad whenever he saw it.

102
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:45,005
You know, angel, I
am really glad you

103
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,673
Could make it out here.

104
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:48,742
I'm really glad that
we could finally

105
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,643
Spend some time together.

106
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,512
Hopefully, I can
prove to you that I'm

107
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:55,282
Not a bad guy after all.

108
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:58,418
That's not what I've heard.

109
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:01,188
Don't believe
everything you hear.

110
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:01,989

you out to the desert?

00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,283
I gotta take a piss.

114
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,119
You come all the way out to
the desert to take a piss.

115

use the john, Frank.

most important thing.

during the stunts.

right after lunch.

last scene, Sav.

got there, I mean, Frank...

Are you all right, Kirsten?

152
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:10,951
Please go on.

there, Dad and Harry were

Actually, Harry was just
pulling up a lot of dirt.

156
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:26,366
Stan, I don't think
we're going to use

157
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:27,767
The dynamite on this one.

158
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,369
Maybe we'll use a flare gun.

159
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,203
I don't know yet.

160
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:36,809
Now, you can really
see your dad go to work.

161
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,580
Stan, we're ready with the
effects test any time you are.

162

going on out here?

effects, Mr. Cohen.

Oh, that stuff.

176

We do that stuff in the
business all the time.

I do mean the industry.

it wasn't such

182
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:44,344
Oh, give him three days.

183

If he hasn't finished
the movie, I'll fire him.

184
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,848
Then you guys will
have lots of time.

185
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,118
That may be the
only way, Mr. Cohen.

186
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:53,320
Mr. Cohen was my father.

187
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,288
Please, Kiersty, call me Frank.

188
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,457
I've produced films for
your father for eight years.

189
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:58,458
Call me Frank.

190
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:01,828
No one else offers
you that respect.

191
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:04,064
That's right, Frank.

192
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:05,198
Oh, Harry.

193
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,167
Harry, I want to talk
to you about some bills

194
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:07,967
For the effects.

195
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:08,935
Excuse me, honey.

196
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,976
It's strange that none of us
had any idea what was going on,

197
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:18,945
Just five miles away.

198
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,287
Let's go, you slimeball.

199
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,589
Ain't got all day.

200
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,058
Come on, mama's boy.

201
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:32,059
I bet you got to squat to pee.

202
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,260
Now, get up this mountain.

203
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,199
It's a long way down, girls.

204
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,136
All right, boy.

205
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:10,297
Don't think about it.

206
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:12,365
Just do it.

207
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,600
Forget about those
assholes up there.

208
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,469
Just... you can do it.

209
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:17,270
I can't.

210
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:25,178
I can't do it, man.

211
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:28,148
You gotta do it.

212
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:31,451
I can't with all
this shit on me.

213
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:35,288
What are you doing down
there, boy, whacking your meat?

214
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,423
You gotta do it.

215
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:39,392
Damn it, Parker, it's
going to be your ass.

216
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:40,360
These clamps.

217
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,461
I could pull myself up the rope.

218
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:47,360
Cowardice, gentleman, cannot
be tolerated in any company.

219
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,330
Especially, gentleman,
in the mission

220
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,933
We're presently confronted with.

221
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:56,369
You've got an attitude
problem, Grasso.

222
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,837
Now if you don't like
what we're doing here,

223
00:18:57,937 --> 00:18:59,005
You can take a walk.

224
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,278
Colonel, I seen firsthand
the need for what

225
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:08,014
We're doing in Central America.

226
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:11,150
What I can't swallow is
this bootcamp bullshit.

227
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:13,753
There's big money in
this supply mission.

228
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:17,990
I put it together and
we'll do it my way.

229
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,559
That's the trouble
with you, Parker.

230
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,660
Big money.

231
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,130
There's no trouble with money.

232
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:25,598
Do we understand each other?

233
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:30,503
Return to the formation.

234
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:44,016
Your deplorable and
embarrassing behavior earlier,

235
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:45,352
Which may have
resulted in taking

236
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:48,488
The life of another soldier,
is deemed insubordinate

237
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:52,024
By this company and any other.

238
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,760
Do you recognize the punishment?

239
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:58,465
Do you recognize the punishment?

240
00:19:58,565 --> 00:19:59,266
Yes, sir.

241
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:18,385
Let this serve as
an example to us all.

242
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:23,823
Adolescent behavior cannot
and will not be tolerated.

243
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:29,796
Dismissed.

244
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:38,271
Cowardice will not be tolerated.

245
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:42,742
Start walking now.

246
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:18,871
[Gun shot]

247
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:24,844
So you stayed on
the set all the time?

248
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:27,346
At first.

249
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:31,818
My dad got real busy and
didn't have much time for me.

250
00:24:18,725 --> 00:24:21,127
[Gun shots]

251
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,554
I was so scared.

252
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:50,056
Why are they doing this?

253
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,057
I don't know, angel.

254
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,027
It's OK.

255
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:57,530
Daddy's here.

256
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,632
Don't worry.

257
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:01,568
I'll never let anybody hurt you.

258
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:07,840
No, Daddy.

259
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,808
Don't leave me.

260
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:11,210
Help me.

261
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:15,314
I'll never leave you.

262
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:16,215
You're my little angel.

263
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:21,087
Ah, shit.

264
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:21,888
Cut.

265
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:26,158
What the hell are you doing?

266
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,126
I'm sorry.

267
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:28,494
I thought you said cut already.

268
00:25:28,595 --> 00:25:30,296
You guys never let me
get any stills anyways.

269
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:32,264
And then Frank gets all
over my shit about it.

270
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,438
Send them to lunch.

271
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,773
OK, people, that's lunch.

272
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:44,410
The next set up will be the
last scene, minus the still

273
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,579
Photographer, thank you.

274
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,548
OK, people that's lunch.

275
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:51,483
Remember, crew eats first.

276
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:02,061
One day I got bored and
left the set during lunch.

277
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:08,267
Oh, it looks like
the brains we blew

278
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:11,771
Out a guy's head in the last
horror flick I worked on.

279
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:12,639
No thanks.

280
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:13,439
Just some salad, please.

281
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:35,027
Hey, look at that sweet thing.

282
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:37,630
Shit, I got a better
bike than that at home.

283
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:38,597
Fuck the bike.

284
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:42,501
I'm talking about those legs.

285
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,604
Hands off if I were you.

286
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:47,707
Why, you doing her?

287
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:49,141
No, she's Sav's.

288
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:50,142
Sav's?

289
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:52,378
Bullshit.

290
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:54,346
I heard he's still
hooked on his ex-wife.

291
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,516
Sav's daughter.

292
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,787
Sav's daughter?

293
00:27:00,887 --> 00:27:02,388
Yeah, that's why I
wouldn't mess with her.

294
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,325
Ah, shit.

295
00:27:15,902 --> 00:27:17,804
How about a ride?

296
00:27:17,904 --> 00:27:19,205
You don't have to be scared.

297
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,974
I'm a safe rider.

298
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:23,342
Come on, at least sit on it.

299
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:24,143
It won't bite you.

300
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:32,484
[Bike fires up]

301
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:33,585
Oops, my foot slipped.

302
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:39,558
Bye.

303
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:49,435
[Bike starts]

304
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:03,275
We lost track of time
and Rick missed his scene.

305
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:05,077
Thank you for your
patience, people.

306
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:06,378
Stand by.

307
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,313
First positions.

308
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:08,114
First positions.

309
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:09,515
All tal on the set.

310
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:10,449
First positions please.

311
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:14,553
What's the hold up, Booby?

312
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:16,688
What is taking so long?

313
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:18,657
Relax, Frank.

314
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,326
How can I relax?

315
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:22,228
We're three fucking
weeks behind as it is.

316
00:29:22,328 --> 00:29:25,397
This is not the place to
talk about this, Frank.

317
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,366
Stan, what are we waiting on?

318
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:28,167
Rick.

319
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,401
Rick's not around.

320
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:30,436
Use someone else.

321
00:29:30,536 --> 00:29:31,437
Fire him.

322
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:34,040
Frank, you're bothering me.

323
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,475
Stan, let's find him.

324
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:37,643
Eddie, where's Rick?

325
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:41,814
He took off.

326
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:43,215
He'll be back.

327
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:45,317
Yeah and so will Jesus.

328
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:47,319
We gotta make a fuckin' movie.

329
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,355
Get someone else.

330
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:52,724
Frank, please.

331
00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:54,560
Eddie, where is he?

332
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,962
He took off with Kiersty.

333
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:58,764
They both took off on bikes.

334
00:29:58,865 --> 00:30:01,633
Eddie, take someone and
bring them back now!

335
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:06,973
I'm making a record of this.

336
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:06,798
Well, your costing
us a mint, Booby.

337
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:08,567
So?

338
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:09,902
So?

339
00:31:10,002 --> 00:31:11,170
Is that all you can say?

340
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:14,006
So?

341
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:16,408
[Sigh]

342
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,474
We've always made money.

343
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:50,276
So we're a few weeks
behind on this one.

344
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:53,279
I'll make it up in
the editing room.

345
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:56,015
How do you plan to do that?

346
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:57,116
I wrote it.

347
00:31:57,216 --> 00:31:58,084
I directed it.

348
00:31:58,184 --> 00:31:59,451
I know what to do.

349
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:07,126
I wish you'd share some
of these secrets with me.

350
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:10,029
I am the producer.

351
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:11,697
Hello, hello?

352
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:12,631
Anybody home, Sav?

353
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:15,501
Frank, get off my back.

354
00:32:22,008 --> 00:32:23,342
We were just
having a good time.

355
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:31,483
We had no idea what was going
on, when all of a sudden.

356
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:40,926
Sweetheart, you're on
government property.

357
00:32:41,027 --> 00:32:44,896
Now, I want you to go back down
there and tell those Hollywood

358
00:32:44,997 --> 00:32:49,368
Faggots that they got 10
minutes to pack up their shit

359
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:52,338
And get off this property.

360
00:32:52,438 --> 00:32:55,807
You understand me?

361
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:58,810
Now move!

362
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,779
[Gun shots]

363
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:01,880
We moved.

364
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,783
Did he specifically
say government property?

365
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:05,817
I'm almost certain.

366
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:12,158
Did you give your
dad the message?

367
00:33:12,258 --> 00:33:14,826
Of course.

368
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:17,729
They shot at us, for God's sake.

369
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,165
Then why didn't you leave?

370
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:25,637
Mr. Cohen, Frank, said
that he had too much money

371
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,939
Tied up in the film
already and that he

372
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,843
Had every right to be there.

373
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:35,114
That's when they showed
up the first time.

374
00:33:35,214 --> 00:33:36,615
It was like a nightmare.

375
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:42,054
Who showed up, Kiersty?

376
00:33:42,154 --> 00:33:44,022
The soldiers.

377
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:47,526
At least they were
dressed like soldiers.

378
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:49,328
They had the two
stuntmen that my father

379
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:51,330
Had sent after me and Rick.

380
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:27,733
You people have been
ordered to evacuate.

381
00:34:34,106 --> 00:34:35,006
But you refuse.

382
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:51,323
That's a pity.

383
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,262
[Gun shots]

384
00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:01,200
Daddy!

385
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:12,244
Hollywood.

386
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:18,317
Don't be here when I get back.

387
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:41,707
We're getting the
hell out of here.

388
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:44,376
I am three weeks behind
and three mil in the hole.

389
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,413
Frank, we got a
dead man over there.

390
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:49,315
Stuntmen get
killed all the time.

391
00:35:49,415 --> 00:35:51,550
Frank, I'll call the police.

392
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:03,629
Please, I have to
go to the bathroom.

393
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:04,430
Dan, go with her.

394
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,300
Damn it.

395
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,403
We should have never let
Parker pick his own people.

396
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,372
Hillary's a documented psycho.

397
00:36:13,472 --> 00:36:14,773
How did Parker to get
him out of the ward

398
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:15,907
At Washington Memorial?

399
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,677
Certain people
gave him the juice.

400
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:19,745
Damn it!

401
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:22,681
You know no matter
what happens, the man

402
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:24,483
Is not going to be pleased.

403
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:25,284
Would you be?

404
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:30,956
The poor kid's
throwing her guts up.

405
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:32,858
For Christ sakes,
Lauffers, how much longer

406
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:33,659
Does this have to go on?

407
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:35,427
As long as it takes, Dunne.

408
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:36,828
I didn't sign on to hurt kids.

409
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:37,929
Nobody did.

410
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:38,897
Now, just calm down.

411
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:46,505
I'm sorry.

412
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:47,706
It's all right.

413
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:49,841
Are you OK?

414
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,943
I'm OK now.

415
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,279
Do you feel like going on?

416
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:55,013
We can stop if you
don't feel like it.

417
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:56,415
No.

418
00:36:56,515 --> 00:36:58,350
I'm OK.

419
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,819
I'll be all right now.

420
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,488
Please go on.

421
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:05,156
It was horrible.

422
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:07,526
People were screaming
and yelling.

423
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:11,597
And no one knew what to do.

424
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:15,166
Somehow my dad got
everyone together

425
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:18,704
And we started to load up.

426
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:22,908
Dad told me to start
packing up his trailer.

427
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:24,676
There was a lot to do.

428
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:28,780
It took longer than
anyone thought.

429
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,051
Dad, Harry, and I
were in Dad's trailer.

430
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:35,053
Suddenly, there
was more gun fire.

431
00:37:49,535 --> 00:37:51,937
[Gun shots]

432
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:02,508
Over here.

433
00:39:02,608 --> 00:39:03,308
I got it.

434
00:39:03,409 --> 00:39:05,977
I got it.

435
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,979
[Rapid gun fire]

436
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:11,450
Pull out.

437
00:39:16,522 --> 00:39:18,624
Why do you think
he let you live?

438
00:39:18,724 --> 00:39:19,991
I don't know.

439
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,827
OK?

440
00:39:21,927 --> 00:39:23,995
I guess he was more
scared than I was.

441
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:44,382
I heard his fucking neck snap.

442
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:45,817
His body just went limp.

443
00:39:48,654 --> 00:39:52,624
You know the second and
third, knife went in so smooth,

444
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,226
I don't even think I hit a bump.

445
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:56,862
It all went so fast.

446
00:39:56,962 --> 00:39:59,297
I bet they don't even
know what happened.

447
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,231
I felt such power.

448
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:01,032
I just wa...

449
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,305
That's the way it is
on your first mission.

450
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:13,879
Look in some poor soul's eyes.

451
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:16,347
To be able to feel
his total fear.

452
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,253
To know that you
control his destiny.

453
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:28,126
It's the ultimate rush.

454
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:35,867
Makes you wonder.

455
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:41,607
Do you breathe or are you breath
for something much greater?

456
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:54,886
It's called the
full circle, boy.

457
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:59,658
You understand?

458
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:01,126
The full circle.

459
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:10,035
You live and you die and
hopefully you make your mark.

460
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:17,442
You live and you die
and you make your mark.

461
00:41:17,543 --> 00:41:19,778
You understand?

462
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:24,449
You live and you die
and you make your mark.

463
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,416
You understand?

464
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:33,224
These are innocent people.

465
00:41:36,762 --> 00:41:38,630
What have they done to us?

466
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,832
Their bodies are still warm
and you talk about them

467
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:41,800
Like their flies on the wall.

468
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:49,507
Hey.

469
00:41:49,608 --> 00:41:52,510
I wasn't hired to kill people.

470
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:54,980
I was hired to
try and save them.

471
00:42:00,085 --> 00:42:04,322
These people aren't
harming anyone.

472
00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:06,291
You fucking pussy.

473
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:25,410
I'm concerned about you, son.

474
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,946
You constantly refer to
the objects of your mission

475
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,448
In the present tense.

476
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,250
I'm not sure I like
the way that sounds.

477
00:42:36,588 --> 00:42:38,356
Did any of you men
witness this soldier's

478
00:42:38,456 --> 00:42:39,390
Performance in battle?

479
00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:46,364
I take it from the
silence, the answer is no.

480
00:42:46,464 --> 00:42:49,567
They're innocent.

481
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:52,003
They don't have anything
to do with our cause.

482
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:54,439
They had no reason to die.

483
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:57,709
And what's wrong with
the rest of you men?

484
00:42:57,809 --> 00:43:00,912
We don't celebrate
after bloodshed.

485
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:02,981
We mourn.

486
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:05,917
We wear black.

487
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:07,686
We don't laugh and drink.

488
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:21,366
My first mission
assignment, I froze up too.

489
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:27,372
I saw this poor woman with
this little baby in her arms.

490
00:43:30,876 --> 00:43:34,680
Tears filled my eyes.

491
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,816
I put down my gun.

492
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:38,650
I couldn't shoot.

493
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:44,022
I understand how you feel.

494
00:43:47,525 --> 00:43:53,098
Putting a bullet in
someone is very difficult.

495
00:43:53,198 --> 00:44:02,373
And when I saw that little
baby, and that woman,

496
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,875
I couldn't shoot.

497
00:44:08,914 --> 00:44:11,282
I couldn't pull the trigger.

498
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:19,357
That's why I used the bayonet.

499
00:44:31,903 --> 00:44:33,371
Warm up the vehicles.

500
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:35,306
It'll be daylight soon.

501
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:39,210
We've got to terminate
the rest of them.

502
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,412
Our friends from Central
America will be here tonight

503
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,148
To pick up the shipment.

504
00:44:43,248 --> 00:44:45,683
By then, I want those bodies.

505
00:44:45,784 --> 00:44:48,153
Nothing can stand in the
way of this transaction.

506
00:44:48,253 --> 00:44:51,656
There's too much at stake.

507
00:44:51,757 --> 00:44:54,392
Jones, Peters, Davis,
and Stellars, you

508
00:44:54,492 --> 00:44:56,494
Stay here and guard the crates.

509
00:44:56,594 --> 00:44:59,064
The rest of you, let's move out.

510
00:44:59,164 --> 00:45:00,231
All right, you
heard the colonel.

511
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:00,999
Let's move out!

512
00:45:19,317 --> 00:45:21,686
What did you do then?

513
00:45:21,787 --> 00:45:25,891
We waited until it got dark.

514
00:45:25,991 --> 00:45:30,628
Dad figured our chances
would be better at night.

515
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,899
When we came out, there
were bodies everywhere.

516
00:45:33,999 --> 00:45:36,835
And the cars were all shot up.

517
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:42,273
Daddy, I was so scared.

518
00:45:42,373 --> 00:45:45,243
Why are they doing this?

519
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,212
Why?

520
00:45:47,312 --> 00:45:49,180
I don't know, my angel.

521
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,149
But don't be scared.

522
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:54,619
Daddy's here to
take care of you.

523
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:55,586
Don't worry.

524
00:45:55,686 --> 00:46:00,058
I won't let anyone
ever hurt you.

525
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:05,964
No, please don't leave.

526
00:46:06,064 --> 00:46:08,433
Hold me.

527
00:46:08,533 --> 00:46:10,902
I'll never leave you.

528
00:46:11,002 --> 00:46:12,337
You're my angel.

529
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:13,138
I was so scared.

530
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:18,576
We walked all night.

531
00:46:18,676 --> 00:46:21,312
Did anyone else survive?

532
00:46:21,412 --> 00:46:24,149
We found Rick and Ron,
the sound man once we

533
00:46:24,249 --> 00:46:26,417
Reached this wooded area.

534
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:28,987
Dad started laying out
some plans to protect us,

535
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:31,456
Just in case they
came looking for us.

536
00:46:31,556 --> 00:46:33,291
All right, how much of
the blood do we have?

537
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:35,060
Got about two gallons left.

538
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,161
What else do we have?

539
00:46:36,261 --> 00:46:37,762
I got some great stuff on sound.

540
00:46:37,863 --> 00:46:39,797
I don't know what we can do
with it, but we've got it.

541
00:46:39,898 --> 00:46:42,700
I also grabbed a roll
of wire and a few tools.

542
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,801
Harry.

543
00:46:43,902 --> 00:46:45,436
Most of my supplies
got burned, but I still

544
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:47,438
Found a few squibs
and a couple low power

545
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:49,374
Explosives and some rope.

546
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:52,277
I got some rigging, but
nothing I think we can use.

547
00:46:52,377 --> 00:46:54,880
I don't even know why I took it.

548
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:55,680
Let's give it a go.

549
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:21,106
For you two, along the
tree line for three miles,

550
00:47:21,206 --> 00:47:23,108
Work your way down.

551
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:24,575
OK, now you two,
I want you to do

552
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,077
The same thing along the river.

553
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:29,080
Hillary, you take these two
men and follow their trail.

554
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,882
I'm going to take the
Jeep and go back to camp.

555
00:47:30,982 --> 00:47:32,783
Keep communications
open every 20 minutes.

556
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:47,165
If you find them,
I want them myself.

557
00:47:47,265 --> 00:47:48,333
I want to see them die.

558
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,469
Don't worry, angel,
everything will be all right.

559
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:26,371
Trust me.

560
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:29,174
I trust you, Daddy.

561
00:48:29,274 --> 00:48:30,341
Excuse us, angel.

562
00:48:33,478 --> 00:48:34,745
What's happening, Sav?

563
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:36,047
Listen, we've got to move fast.

564
00:48:36,147 --> 00:48:37,648
Maybe we can get lucky.

565
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,385
From this point on,
Harry, you go due north

566
00:48:40,485 --> 00:48:42,853
And continue to leave
a trail of blood.

567
00:48:42,954 --> 00:48:45,356
Ron, you do the
same and go south.

568
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:51,062
Each of you go for an hour and
then turn 135 degrees due west.

569
00:48:51,162 --> 00:48:54,432
When you meet, go north
another half hour,

570
00:48:54,532 --> 00:48:56,301
Where we'll meet you.

571
00:48:56,401 --> 00:49:00,138
Leave those explosives
and the tools.

572
00:49:00,238 --> 00:49:03,508
Anything here blow
off an arm or a foot?

573
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:08,379
No, but, you might try these.

574
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:09,780
Just combine the
red and the blue.

575
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,917
It may not do much damage,
but there's a possibility

576
00:49:13,018 --> 00:49:14,685
F blowing off a toe or two.

577
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,022
That might be all we need.

578
00:49:17,122 --> 00:49:19,057
Set your watches.

579
00:49:19,157 --> 00:49:22,427
It's now 10:00.

580
00:49:22,527 --> 00:49:26,197
I'll see you both at
12:30, God willing.

581
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:26,998
Be good, Sav.

582
00:49:30,235 --> 00:49:30,935
Good luck, pal.

583
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:38,876
The red and the blue.

584
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,845
Are you sure you're OK?

585
00:49:40,945 --> 00:49:43,214
Yeah, I'm fine.

586
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:46,184
Like I said, it's
going to be all right.

587
00:49:46,284 --> 00:49:48,553
Yeah, whatever.

588
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:51,022
So what are we going to do?

589
00:49:51,122 --> 00:49:53,158
We are going to try
and show those maniacs

590
00:49:53,258 --> 00:49:56,461
That they're not dealing with
some flakes from Hollywood.

591
00:49:56,561 --> 00:49:59,797
Kirsten, take this wire and
stretch it across to that tree.

592
00:49:59,897 --> 00:50:02,133
Rick, take this one to
that tree down there

593
00:50:02,233 --> 00:50:06,104
And fasten it
tight to the trunk.

594
00:50:06,204 --> 00:50:07,072
Come on, Kirsten.

595
00:50:27,392 --> 00:50:29,627
Hey, slow down.

596
00:50:29,727 --> 00:50:31,562
Take it easy.

597
00:50:31,662 --> 00:50:34,165
Let the other guys find them.

598
00:50:34,265 --> 00:50:35,266
What are you talking about?

599
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:36,067
Let's move.

600
00:50:42,607 --> 00:50:45,476
OK, that tension works good.

601
00:50:45,576 --> 00:50:48,379
Got to tighten this one
up so you bounce, Betty.

602
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:54,519
OK.

603
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:56,487
Leave a surprise for these guys.

604
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,970
God, I hope this works.

605
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:13,971
Me too.

606
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:14,972
All right, let's move.

607
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,107
It's too hot to run.

608
00:51:16,207 --> 00:51:19,009
So let's go quickly
and try not to stop.

609
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:56,581
River patrol to Parker.

610
00:51:56,681 --> 00:51:58,316
Come in, Colonel.

611
00:51:58,416 --> 00:51:59,250
This is Parker.

612
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:01,686
Go ahead, river patrol

613
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:03,454
No sign of anything.

614
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:04,755
Any further instructions?

615
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:06,424
Stay close to the water.

616
00:52:06,524 --> 00:52:07,825
Sooner or later the
heat will get to them

617
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:09,260
And they'll have
to come in to you.

618
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,195
Copy sir.

619
00:52:10,295 --> 00:52:10,995
Close to the water.

620
00:53:33,844 --> 00:53:35,246
Why are we doing this?

621
00:53:35,346 --> 00:53:36,447
I mean, the way
this pig's bleeding,

622
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:39,384
He's going to be dead
by the time we find him.

623
00:53:39,484 --> 00:53:42,553
Shit, if it makes
Parker happy, I'm happy.

624
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:43,488
Fuck it.

625
00:53:43,588 --> 00:53:45,089
Wait.

626
00:53:45,189 --> 00:53:46,524
A wire.

627
00:53:46,624 --> 00:53:48,893
Looks like some kind
of homemade booby.

628
00:53:48,993 --> 00:53:50,828
Recon the area.

629
00:53:50,928 --> 00:53:53,163
All right.

630
00:53:53,264 --> 00:53:54,632
Parker.

631
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:57,302
Come in, Parker.

632
00:53:57,402 --> 00:53:59,270
This is Parker.

633
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:02,607
Looks like we got us a
homemade mine here, sir.

634
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:03,408
Terrific.

635
00:54:03,508 --> 00:54:04,875
Let's see what they got.

636
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:05,876
Yes, sir.

637
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:19,824
You ready?

638
00:54:25,396 --> 00:54:28,633
What fucking Hollywood bullshit.

639
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:31,336
Parker, false
alarm on that mine.

640
00:54:31,436 --> 00:54:33,037
I got meaner farts than that.

641
00:54:33,137 --> 00:54:35,506
[Explosion]

642
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:36,974
[Moaning]

643
00:54:37,074 --> 00:54:40,611
Hillary, Hillary, come in.

644
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:41,712
Fucking shit.

645
00:54:41,812 --> 00:54:44,382
Man, they blew your
fucking foot off, boy.

646
00:54:44,482 --> 00:54:45,883
Shit.

647
00:54:45,983 --> 00:54:49,320
God damn it, Hillary, come in.

648
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:50,821
Colonel.

649
00:54:50,921 --> 00:54:52,289
Come in, Colonel.

650
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:54,258
They set us up.

651
00:54:54,359 --> 00:54:56,293
Yeah, there was a second one.

652
00:54:56,394 --> 00:54:59,997
They blew his fucking foot off.

653
00:55:00,097 --> 00:55:01,432
Continue without him.

654
00:55:01,532 --> 00:55:03,368
He's no good to us now anyway.

655
00:55:03,468 --> 00:55:04,435
Is he is great pain?

656
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:06,937
Yeah, fucking A he is.

657
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:09,407
Like a horse with a broken leg.

658
00:55:09,507 --> 00:55:10,775
You know what to do, Hillary.

659
00:55:14,345 --> 00:55:16,747
Yes, sir.

660
00:55:16,847 --> 00:55:18,749
Hillary.

661
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:20,751
Yes, colonel.

662
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:22,286
I want to hear it.

663
00:55:38,569 --> 00:55:39,404
No!

664
00:55:39,504 --> 00:55:40,337
[Gun shot]

665
00:55:40,438 --> 00:55:42,172
Hillary, please.

666
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:43,774
Please, Hillary, no.

667
00:55:43,874 --> 00:55:45,743
I want to live, Hillary.

668
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:47,412
I thought we were friends.

669
00:55:47,512 --> 00:55:48,212
Please.

670
00:55:48,312 --> 00:55:50,180
Jesus Christ.

671
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,682
Mother of God, no.

672
00:55:51,782 --> 00:55:53,651
Hillary, please, Hillary.

673
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:55,653
Please, Hillary.

674
00:55:55,753 --> 00:55:57,121
Oh, Hillary!

675
00:55:57,221 --> 00:56:02,092
[Gun shot]

676
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:02,893
Thank you, Hillary.

677
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:09,767
Now, I want you to get the rest
of those game players soon.

678
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:12,036
I don't want them
getting too cute.

679
00:56:12,136 --> 00:56:13,303
Do you copy?

680
00:56:13,404 --> 00:56:14,104
Copy colonel.

681
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:27,184
Do you think our little
surprise did any good?

682
00:56:27,284 --> 00:56:30,387
By the sound we heard,
it did something.

683
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:32,089
We're not going to make it.

684
00:56:32,189 --> 00:56:35,092
It's all my fault. It's
my fault Frank's dead.

685
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:36,393
It's my fault all
the others died.

686
00:56:36,494 --> 00:56:37,862
It's my fault
we're going to die.

687
00:56:37,962 --> 00:56:39,229
Stop it, Just shut up.

688
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:40,531
Grab hold of yourself.

689
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:43,133
You're not helping matters any.

690
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,636
Rick lost it.

691
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:48,873
He kept blaming himself
for everyone's death,

692
00:56:48,973 --> 00:56:51,609
Saying that if we hadn't
left the set, none of this

693
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:52,409
Would have happened.

694
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:58,649
Daddy and Rick had a fight.

695
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:01,151
We never saw him again.

696
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:05,022
You better just
kill me right know.

697
00:57:05,122 --> 00:57:07,892
They're going to kill us anyway.

698
00:57:07,992 --> 00:57:08,693
Water.

699
00:57:08,793 --> 00:57:09,494
I want some water.

700
00:57:09,594 --> 00:57:10,595
We have no water.

701
00:57:10,695 --> 00:57:12,329
Yes, there's a river I know.

702
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,363
It's three miles south.

703
00:57:13,464 --> 00:57:14,532
I'll bring some back.
No!

704
00:57:14,632 --> 00:57:16,501
We stick together until
Ron and Harry get back.

705
00:57:16,601 --> 00:57:17,334
No, I want some water.

706
00:57:30,881 --> 00:57:33,250
[Cry of frustration]

707
00:57:59,176 --> 00:58:01,579
Nothing new to report, sir.

708
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:04,348
No sign of any of them.

709
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:06,083
Shall we come back to base?

710
00:58:06,183 --> 00:58:09,253
Do not come near me until
these people are dead.

711
00:58:09,353 --> 00:58:10,888
Do you understand?

712
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:13,824
Found something.

713
00:58:13,924 --> 00:58:15,025
Hold on sir.

714
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:15,993
I think we found something.

715
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,044
Looks like more blood, sir.

716
00:58:39,416 --> 00:58:41,185
It appears to be branching
off in two directions there.

717
00:58:41,285 --> 00:58:42,419
Split up and find them.

718
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,821
We're losing light.

719
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:44,755
Keep me posted.

720
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:45,556
Out.

721
00:58:48,626 --> 00:58:50,861
You heard the man.

722
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:51,662
What's your opinion?

723
00:59:06,977 --> 00:59:09,346
[Tape tearing]

724
00:59:11,415 --> 00:59:18,488
This is a squid When in doubt
trigger it, then play dead.

725
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:20,825
There will be a thump.

726
00:59:20,925 --> 00:59:22,026
But it's better
than the real thing.

727
00:59:32,637 --> 00:59:34,739
Here.

728
00:59:34,839 --> 00:59:36,240
This will protect you too.

729
00:59:45,683 --> 00:59:47,718
Honestly, Dad.

730
00:59:47,818 --> 00:59:51,421
I wanted to spend time with you.

731
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:53,858
But I never imagined...

732
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:56,661
Some summer vacation.

733
00:59:56,761 --> 00:59:57,895
What do you think's
going to happen?

734
01:00:05,202 --> 01:00:07,537
Do you know when
you were born, I

735
01:00:07,638 --> 01:00:08,973
Used to go around
to all the neighbors

736
01:00:09,073 --> 01:00:14,011
Telling fantastic stories about
the times we had together.

737
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:14,812
What do you mean?

738
01:00:17,514 --> 01:00:19,116
When you were a baby,
I told our landlady

739
01:00:19,216 --> 01:00:22,419
At our first apartment that you
read to me when you were a year

740
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:24,354
Old and walked at five months.

741
01:00:27,024 --> 01:00:28,726
And she'd grab your mother
down in the laundry room

742
01:00:28,826 --> 01:00:30,594
And I'd get caught.

743
01:00:30,695 --> 01:00:35,766
And I'd just say, she walks
and talks only for me.

744
01:00:35,866 --> 01:00:39,369
And to this day, I
still believe you do.

745
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:42,907
You're still telling
stories today.

746
01:00:43,007 --> 01:00:46,176
Mom says you've never changed.

747
01:00:46,276 --> 01:00:47,878
I haven't.

748
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:50,915
You see in every
story I tell, there's

749
01:00:51,015 --> 01:00:53,884
A father who loves his
daughter more than anything

750
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:55,052
Else in the whole world.

751
01:00:59,556 --> 01:01:00,590
Get ready, angel.

752
01:01:00,691 --> 01:01:01,558

753
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:15,039

754
01:01:15,139 --> 01:01:15,840
Come in, Hillary.

755
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:22,646
Yeah, go ahead, Colonel.

756
01:01:22,747 --> 01:01:24,281
Just wanted to let you
know that Stevens might

757
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:25,149
Be doubling back your way.

758
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:31,121
Thank you, sir.

759
01:01:51,175 --> 01:01:53,077
This ain't my day.

760
01:03:46,523 --> 01:03:48,758
River patrol to Parker.

761
01:03:48,859 --> 01:03:50,227
You were right.

762
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:51,728
One of them was thirsty.

763
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:52,829
Now he swims with the trout.

764
01:04:07,711 --> 01:04:08,612
Parker to ridge platoon.

765
01:04:08,712 --> 01:04:09,579
Do you copy?

766
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:16,653
This is one half of the
ridge patrol, Colonel.

767
01:04:16,753 --> 01:04:19,656
Move in, then, ridge
patrol Close in tight.

768
01:04:19,756 --> 01:04:21,191
I read you.

769
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:23,627
Over and out.

770
01:04:23,727 --> 01:04:24,561
Parker to Stevens.

771
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:25,495
Come in Stevens.

772
01:04:30,434 --> 01:04:31,936
Parker to Stevens.

773
01:04:32,036 --> 01:04:32,736
Come in, Stevens.

774
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:42,246
Colonel this is Hillary.

775
01:04:42,346 --> 01:04:46,483
Stevens already
knows where they are.

776
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:48,052
He's got a better
view than any of us.

778
01:05:22,386 --> 01:05:24,754

This is Parker.

780
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:28,392
I've got two of them, sir.

781
01:05:28,492 --> 01:05:30,394
Are you sure, soldier?

782
01:05:30,494 --> 01:05:34,364
I'm standing over their
dead bodies now, sir.

783
01:05:34,464 --> 01:05:37,301
Mr. [inaudible] May he
respectfully rest in peace.

786
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:28,752
So Harry killed at least
three of the mercenaries.

787
01:06:28,852 --> 01:06:31,455
Is Harry still alive?

788
01:06:31,555 --> 01:06:32,622
Come on, honey.

789
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:34,058
I know it's rough.

790
01:06:34,158 --> 01:06:37,427
But we've come this far.

791
01:06:37,527 --> 01:06:40,164
Harry's dead.

792
01:06:40,264 --> 01:06:41,731
He thought we made it.

793
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:42,532

01:06:42,632 --> 01:06:43,900

We made it!

796

We got them all!

797
01:06:46,903 --> 01:06:47,804
We did it!

Mission accomplished, sir.

803
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:20,870
I'm going to be bringing
two back in a cage.

804
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,008
I've had my fun for today.

805
01:07:31,014 --> 01:07:33,417
You're sure Harry's dead?

806
01:07:33,517 --> 01:07:37,554
Yes, he's dead.

807

Why don't you leave me alone?

812
01:07:47,764 --> 01:07:49,699
It's OK, honey.

813
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:53,270
Just a couple more questions
and you can get out of here.

814
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:55,839
I swear no one will
ever bother you again.

815
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:04,514
They took us back
to their camp.

816
01:08:04,614 --> 01:08:07,083
What exactly did you see there?

817
01:08:07,184 --> 01:08:10,053
Soldiers.

818
01:08:10,154 --> 01:08:11,321
Some of them spoke Spanish.

819
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:14,958
And a lot of crates.

820
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:21,030
The soldiers were loading
crates and some kind of powder

821
01:08:21,131 --> 01:08:24,134
Into trucks.

822
01:08:24,234 --> 01:08:25,369
Do you know what
the powder was?

823
01:08:28,338 --> 01:08:30,106
I think it was drugs.

824
01:08:33,543 --> 01:08:35,779
What else did you see?

825
01:08:35,879 --> 01:08:39,015
Dad and I were dragged
inside of the tent,

826
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:41,551
Where there was a
general from somewhere

827
01:08:41,651 --> 01:08:45,422
In Central or South America.

828
01:08:45,522 --> 01:08:48,091
You see, Colonel
Parker, my people

829
01:08:48,192 --> 01:08:51,895
Would rather pay you in cash
for the help you are giving us.

830
01:08:51,995 --> 01:08:54,231
Business is business.

831
01:08:54,331 --> 01:08:56,666
Now you gave me the
choice of either cash

832
01:08:56,766 --> 01:08:59,035
Or the equivalent
in white powder.

833
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,104
My decision still stands.

834
01:09:01,205 --> 01:09:03,807
There's nothing you can say
that will change my mind.

835
01:09:03,907 --> 01:09:08,912
What to keep me from pulling
out of the deal completely?

836
01:09:09,012 --> 01:09:10,847
What's to keep me from
blowing your brains

837
01:09:10,947 --> 01:09:13,683
All over our fine duck.

838
01:09:13,783 --> 01:09:15,519
Then I keep the cash?

839
01:09:15,619 --> 01:09:17,287
I keep the white powder.

840
01:09:17,387 --> 01:09:19,556
And I take the guns and
I sell them to your enemy

841
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:22,292
And really make a killing.

842
01:09:22,392 --> 01:09:25,195
That is something you
would never do because deep

843
01:09:25,295 --> 01:09:26,530
Down you believe in our cause.

844
01:09:31,201 --> 01:09:34,338
Just in time, Hillary.

845
01:09:34,438 --> 01:09:40,109
To let our amigo here know how
we really feel about his cause.

846
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:46,850
You see, this man and this
is a luscious young woman

847
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:51,488

destroyed our plan today.

Had they succeeded, all
your little fighters

849
01:09:56,493 --> 01:10:00,497
Would have died without any
chance to defend themselves.

850
01:10:00,597 --> 01:10:02,332
What does this man do?

851
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:10,006
He takes what we do for
real and glorifies it

852
01:10:10,106 --> 01:10:12,576
For the screen.

853
01:10:12,676 --> 01:10:15,312

854
01:10:15,412 --> 01:10:18,648
You know, there are a lot
of problems in this world.

855
01:10:18,748 --> 01:10:22,619
And I'm one of them.

856
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,053

of this shipment

budget you'd ever have

But you gave us
good sport today.

860
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:36,433
So do you have any
final requests?

861
01:10:36,533 --> 01:10:39,068

and forgive us our trespasses

01:24:53,789 --> 01:24:57,926
Make sure all loose
ends are tied up.

914
01:24:58,026 --> 01:24:58,727
This job sucks.

915
01:25:13,309 --> 01:25:14,009
This is Stewart.

916
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:15,311
Put me through to him.

917
01:25:18,647 --> 01:25:21,150
I'll be in Washington
in the morning, sir.

918
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:22,218
Yes, sir.

919
01:25:22,318 --> 01:25:25,888
There's a company jet
waiting for me now.

920
01:25:25,988 --> 01:25:28,324
The film is secure.

921
01:25:28,424 --> 01:25:31,994
The girl was the only survivor.

922
01:25:32,094 --> 01:25:35,364
The company is tying
up all loose ends

923
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:38,100
Left by Colonel Parker.

924
01:25:38,201 --> 01:25:39,635
You'll have a full
report in the Oval Office

925
01:25:39,735 --> 01:25:41,904
In the morning, sir.

926
01:25:42,004 --> 01:25:42,705
Thank you, sir.

927
01:25:58,721 --> 01:26:00,155
