1
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:06,819
(birds chirping)

2
00:00:10,588 --> 00:00:13,088
(tense music)

3
00:00:14,754 --> 00:00:17,671
(Indians chanting)

4
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:58,702
(saw scraping)

5
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:06,817
(peaceful music)

6
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:20,778
(Indians chanting)

7
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:25,215
(tense music)

8
00:01:47,298 --> 00:01:49,881
(tree falling)

9
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,392
(geese squawking)

10
00:01:58,393 --> 00:02:01,310
(big cat growling)

11
00:02:03,059 --> 00:02:05,809
(bears grunting)

12
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:11,022
(birds squawking)

13
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:17,181
(tree falling)

14
00:02:19,465 --> 00:02:22,382
(Indians chanting)

15
00:02:24,429 --> 00:02:26,929
(tense music)

16
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,420
- If he gets this approved
by the mayor, Chief,

17
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,901
I don't know how we're gonna stop him.

18
00:03:02,902 --> 00:03:05,102
- The only thing we can
rely on, my brother,

19
00:03:06,704 --> 00:03:07,704
is prayer.

20
00:03:22,621 --> 00:03:24,707
(light playful music)

21
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:25,859
- [Man] Hey.

22
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,759
- Sorry, Dad.

23
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,369
- Let's go, Dylan, get
your mom and sister.

24
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,499
Come on.

25
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,573
We're hittin' the road.

26
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,005
- Let's go!

27
00:03:43,918 --> 00:03:45,442
- Oh ho, ho, ho, ho.
- Ugh!

28
00:03:45,443 --> 00:03:47,702
- Like we said, no basketball.
- Let me go.

29
00:03:47,703 --> 00:03:48,689
Come on, Dad!
- No TV.

30
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,749
- Let me down!
- Just you, the woods,

31
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,142
wild animals, poison oak and poison ivy.

32
00:03:53,143 --> 00:03:54,207
Get in the car.

33
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,206
- [Dylan] Ugh!

34
00:03:55,207 --> 00:03:57,789
(cheery music)

35
00:03:58,756 --> 00:03:59,799
Hold on!

36
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,193
I forgot my Walkman.

37
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,423
- [Dad] Uh uh, no turning back, Dylan.

38
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,879
(adventurous music)

39
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:25,025
(video game blasting)

40
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:27,549
- You can take the boy out of the city,

41
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,829
but you can't take the
city out of the boy.

42
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,130
- I consider getting
this far a minor victory.

43
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,597
- I'd consider changing your mind

44
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:37,931
about developing the mountain a victory.

45
00:04:39,107 --> 00:04:41,409
- Are there any wild animals up here?

46
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,243
- Sure.

47
00:04:42,244 --> 00:04:46,603
There's birds and squirrels
and even a raccoon or two.

48
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,273
That's the Mark's family
in the great outdoors.

49
00:04:54,022 --> 00:04:57,522
(light adventurous music)

50
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,700
There you go.

51
00:05:04,701 --> 00:05:07,033
- [Dylan] Okay.

52
00:05:07,034 --> 00:05:09,284
- Ugh, here you go, Nicole.

53
00:05:12,943 --> 00:05:14,863
Hey, bud, why don't you give
me a hand with the tent, huh?

54
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:15,810
Give me a hand with the tent?

55
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,643
- Okay.

56
00:05:16,644 --> 00:05:18,226
- [Dad] All righty.

57
00:05:20,383 --> 00:05:22,899
- So what kind of work do you
have to do up here, Daddy?

58
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,179
- Well, it's so beautiful up here

59
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,239
that I'm going to approve
a developer's plans

60
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,309
to build houses on the mountain

61
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,989
and stores and golf courses
and things like that.

62
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,701
- Can people go build a house
on any old mountain they want?

63
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,039
- (chuckling) No.

64
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,249
You see, a long time ago, in 1870,

65
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,879
that's before your
great-great grandpa was born.

66
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,929
The lease, which is the
right to use the land,

67
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,401
was given to the Indians for 125 years.

68
00:05:51,402 --> 00:05:52,235
(peaceful music)

69
00:05:52,236 --> 00:05:54,789
Well, this year, the
state gets the lease back

70
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,249
from the Indians.

71
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,939
So I'm gonna recommend selling the lease

72
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,479
to a developer after I survey his plans.

73
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,369
- See, I told you Daddy owns the mountain.

74
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,379
- No, sweetie, the state of
Oregon owns the mountain.

75
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,383
Daddy just decides what to do with it.

76
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,139
- Daddy better get some work done

77
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,959
so we have some fun later.

78
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,203
- Can we go exploring?

79
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,039
- Well all right, but
don't be gone too long.

80
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,390
I'm gonna fix a good lunch.

81
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,219
- Hey, hey, hey!

82
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,779
You two forgetting something?

83
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,666
(light music)

84
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,763
- [Both] Oh, our backpacks.

85
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,680
- You never know.

86
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:35,629
You always gotta be prepared.

87
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,059
- Say goodbye, Miss Betty.

88
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,930
Bye, Dylan.

89
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:38,933
Bye, Nicole.

90
00:06:42,824 --> 00:06:46,074
(light cheerful music)

91
00:07:07,122 --> 00:07:08,453
- [Dylan] Let's go up there.

92
00:07:10,739 --> 00:07:12,766
- Where are you going?

93
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:15,586
- I think I see a cave or something.

94
00:07:15,587 --> 00:07:18,254
(curious music)

95
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,379
- [Nicole] Don't bears live in caves?

96
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,423
- [Dylan] There's no bears up here.

97
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,263
Wow, it's so clear out.

98
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:39,729
- Is it safe in here, Dylan?

99
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,336
- [Dylan] Yeah, but I got
to check my batteries first.

100
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:43,170
- Come on.

101
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,537
- I'm right behind ya.

102
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:50,059
(light cheerful music)

103
00:07:53,002 --> 00:07:57,169
(video game blasting and booming)

104
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:01,439
- [Nicole] Dylan, come on.

105
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,620
It's dark in here.

106
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,217
- [Dylan] All right, I'm comin'.

107
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,560
(mysterious music)

108
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:15,942
- [Nicole] Hello?

109
00:08:15,943 --> 00:08:17,416
- [Dylan] Shh.

110
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:19,129
- [Nicole] I thought you said it was safe.

111
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,953
- [Dylan] It is, if you're quiet.

112
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,113
Come on, let's see where this goes to.

113
00:08:27,297 --> 00:08:30,214
(mysterious music)

114
00:08:39,098 --> 00:08:40,726
- [Nicole] Wow.

115
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:43,264
This is kinda spooky.

116
00:08:43,265 --> 00:08:48,265
- Yeah, this is cool.

117
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:52,077
(dramatic music)

118
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:55,139
What's happening?
- It's an earthquake!

119
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,069
Let's get outta here!
- Run, Nicole, run!

120
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,506
Come on!

121
00:08:58,507 --> 00:09:00,240
We gotta get outta here!

122
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:02,991
(dramatic music)

123
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,329
Whoa.

124
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,859
- What was that?

125
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,349
- I thought we were dead.

126
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,329
That must have been the
biggest earthquake ever.

127
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,269
- Let's go find mom and dad.

128
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,103
(curious music)

129
00:09:16,104 --> 00:09:17,529
- What the?

130
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,507
It was clear just a minute ago.

131
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,390
Come on!

132
00:09:27,754 --> 00:09:31,319
(dramatic music)

133
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,529
- [Nicole] Do you think we
came out on the wrong side?

134
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,609
- No, I know this is the right side.

135
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,910
Maybe they moved the tent.

136
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,880
Maybe it's this way.

137
00:09:39,881 --> 00:09:42,381
(tense music)

138
00:09:53,724 --> 00:09:54,724
Whoa!

139
00:09:58,355 --> 00:10:00,659
- [Nicole] Dylan, where are we?

140
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,510
- [Dylan] I don't know.

141
00:10:01,511 --> 00:10:03,009
- [Nicole] Where do we go?

142
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,060
- [Dylan] First we have to find the road.

143
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,519
- Whoa, kids.

144
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,533
Where's the fire?

145
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,554
Well, I'm sorry for surprising you two.

146
00:10:17,555 --> 00:10:19,389
(peaceful music)

147
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,299
Where are your kids from?

148
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,300
- Portland.

149
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,943
Isn't everybody up here from Portland?

150
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:26,720
- Well, not everybody.

151
00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:29,179
Could be a few folks from Portland.

152
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,309
- Our folks told us not talk to strangers.

153
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,979
- You're a smart boy.

154
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,319
Where are your folks?

155
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,189
- Well, we were in a
cave somewhere up there.

156
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,771
- You mean to tell me you
kids went into that cave?

157
00:10:41,772 --> 00:10:42,772
- Yeah.

158
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,520
It shook.

159
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:46,350
And then...

160
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:48,203
- And then you lost your folks?

161
00:10:50,186 --> 00:10:51,609
I tell you, you kids
are gonna need some help

162
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,359
finding your parents.

163
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,159
My name's Jeremiah.

164
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,773
I think the best thing you guys
would do would come with me.

165
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:01,607
Or you can stay here with the bears

166
00:11:01,608 --> 00:11:04,019
and the mountain lions if you want.

167
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,770
(peaceful music)

168
00:11:14,252 --> 00:11:16,499
- [Nicole] Well, where are we going?

169
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,703
- [Jeremiah] We'll head down
this way towards my cabin.

170
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,919
Look right out through there.

171
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,299
You ever seen anything so
pretty in your whole life?

172
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,623
- [Dylan] This is amazing.

173
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,089
- [Jeremiah] Were you kids
up by this lake before?

174
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,023
- [Nicole] No, we just got here today.

175
00:11:32,898 --> 00:11:35,029
- Well, the first time I saw this meadow,

176
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,030
I knew I was home.

177
00:11:41,444 --> 00:11:42,444
Come on in.

178
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,639
- Wow.

179
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,818
You must be old.

180
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:54,219
- (chuckling) I'm a few
years older than you are,

181
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,289
but I can still get around
the mountains all right.

182
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,319
- [Nicole] Do you have a car?

183
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,649
- A car?

184
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,623
- Yeah, so we can go find her parents.

185
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,769
- Well, I know we got
to find your parents,

186
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,073
but I don't know what a car is.

187
00:12:09,074 --> 00:12:10,729
I sure don't have one.

188
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,269
- Hey, mister, where are we?

189
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,749
- We're about maybe two or
three days ride from Portland.

190
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,999
- Two or three days?

191
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,759
It only took us two hours in a car.

192
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,589
- Two hours?

193
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,993
Well now, you're gonna
have to explain that to me.

194
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,560
Look, I've got some business

195
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:31,809
I got to take care of in town.

196
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,669
Why don't you kids stay here
and watch the fort for me,

197
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,049
and when I get back,

198
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,289
we'll see about getting
you back to your parents.

199
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,123
How about that?

200
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,599
- We have to find them now.

201
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,919
They'll be worried.

202
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,223
- I thought you said
you were gonna help us.

203
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:45,573
- I want you both to sit down.

204
00:12:45,574 --> 00:12:48,847
I want to tell you something.

205
00:12:48,848 --> 00:12:50,431
Sit down over here.

206
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:53,199
(concerned music)

207
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,029
Listen, kids, now there's
an old Indian legend

208
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,629
about that mountain.

209
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,623
When you go deep into those caves,

210
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,853
well, it takes you into another place.

211
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,459
And when you kids went into that mountain-

212
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,543
- You mean we're someplace else?

213
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,529
- I don't know everything
about this Indian legend.

214
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,980
- I want to find Mom and Dad.

215
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,549
- When I come back,
I'll do everything I can

216
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,229
to get you back to your parents.

217
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,230
I promise.

218
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:20,963
You'll be safe here while
I'm gone, both of you.

219
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,980
Okay.

220
00:13:36,408 --> 00:13:38,991
(sneaky music)

221
00:13:48,113 --> 00:13:50,613
(crate bangs)

222
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,946
- Well, I think that's enough
dynamite to blow this-here

223
00:13:57,947 --> 00:14:01,834
mountain sky high to the moon! (laughs)

224
00:14:01,835 --> 00:14:04,099
- You set that dynamite down any harder,

225
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,123
and next time you'll blow us to the moon.

226
00:14:06,124 --> 00:14:07,219
- Ugh!

227
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,409
- [Man] How many of
these things I gotta do?

228
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,119
- Oh, about 40 or 50 of 'em.

229
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,419
You never know how long it'll take

230
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,186
any of those fools to find any of it.

231
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:20,187
- Hey, hey, Roscoe, Jones,
fools to find fools gold.

232
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,847
Fools to find fools gold.

233
00:14:21,848 --> 00:14:24,431
(all laughing)

234
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,663
- What's so darn funny, Jones?

235
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,535
(funny music)

236
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:33,369
Ugh!

237
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,410
Now look what you've done.

238
00:14:36,345 --> 00:14:37,345
Ugh!

239
00:14:38,783 --> 00:14:43,289
I don't know why I even
work with you nit-wits.

240
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,689
Now Jones, I want you to start over,

241
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,550
and get it right.

242
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:48,700
I don't have any more
of those lead stones.

243
00:14:49,595 --> 00:14:51,289
- Where do you want us to hide 'em, ma'am?

244
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,332
- Where do you think?

245
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,166
- Well, I
- Well-

246
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:54,499
- Where people'll find 'em.

247
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,609
And don't you dare slip up
in front of my darling Burt.

248
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,059
Do you understand me?

249
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,883
I don't want him to worry his
little head about our plan.

250
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,720
Cover up that paint, Jones.

251
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,193
Why, hello, darling.

252
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,059
- Jones, what are you doing?

253
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,559
- Oh, he's just doing a
couple of things for me.

254
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,809
Don't trouble yourself.

255
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,699
How was your meeting with the mayor?

256
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,199
- Oh, I got him behind us all the way.

257
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,929
- Well isn't that just sweet then?

258
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,019
I'm gonna run into town, dear.

259
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,020
Bye-bye.

260
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,213
- Well, come on, men, step it up!

261
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:40,611
(men muttering)

262
00:15:40,612 --> 00:15:43,279
(air whooshing)

263
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:45,829
- [Woman] There's got to be
some animals up here, Bill.

264
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,659
- There haven't been any wild
animals up here for years.

265
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,570
Relax, honey.

266
00:15:49,571 --> 00:15:52,053
- Oh, did they leave their walkie-talkies?

267
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,039
- I already checked.

268
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,573
- I have my walkie-talkie.

269
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,073
In Nicole's backpack.

270
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,749
- Honey, they're kids.

271
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,353
I'm sure they just lost track of time.

272
00:16:05,354 --> 00:16:08,021
(air whooshing)

273
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,149
- Maybe we should've
said goodbye to Jeremiah.

274
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,129
- You're probably right,

275
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,723
but it's too late now.

276
00:16:19,582 --> 00:16:21,979
(tense music)

277
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,399
Do you think Dad and Mom
will really believe us

278
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,069
that we went back in time?

279
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,520
- Do you really think we did?

280
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,053
- [Dylan] Well, there's
only one way to find out.

281
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,459
- All right, men, we need to
blow a hole for the tunnel,

282
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,039
and we're gonna do it right
here under this old cave.

283
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,439
- We gonna b-blow it today, boss?

284
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,093
- As soon as you men get the
dynamite in place and wired.

285
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,237
Why, Jeremiah.

286
00:16:52,238 --> 00:16:53,908
(throat clearing) What brings you

287
00:16:53,909 --> 00:16:55,509
to our humble neck of the woods?

288
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,699
- I thought I'd just stop by

289
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,929
and make sure you gentlemen
weren't gonna blow

290
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,280
that mountain out from
underneath my house.

291
00:17:02,281 --> 00:17:06,704
- (laughing) What makes you
think a crazy idea like that?

292
00:17:06,705 --> 00:17:08,900
- Now come on, Burt.

293
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:10,699
The chief and I know what you
and your girlfriend are up to,

294
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,533
and I just want to let you know

295
00:17:11,534 --> 00:17:13,459
that the residents of this
mountain aren't gonna give up

296
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,179
without a good fight.

297
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,389
- Jeremiah, relax.

298
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,533
There's no need to talk about fightin'

299
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,188
The townspeople seem to be
behind our little railroad plan.

300
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:24,022
- Doggone it.

301
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:26,169
- The residents I'm talking about, Burt,

302
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,173
are the Indians and the animals and me.

303
00:17:29,184 --> 00:17:30,017
(men muttering)

304
00:17:30,018 --> 00:17:31,749
I have nothing against
these good town folks,

305
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,309
but you're a real smooth talker, Burt,

306
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,889
and they'll follow you anywhere

307
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,599
after you tell 'em how
rich they're gonna get.

308
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,943
- Jeremiah, I'm tryin'
to help these people.

309
00:17:41,202 --> 00:17:42,035
They have dreams.

310
00:17:42,036 --> 00:17:43,128
(melancholy music)

311
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:46,369
And we have plans to help the Indians.

312
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:50,013
- [Jones] Yeah, we got
plans, all right. (laughing)

313
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,153
- I know what your plans are.

314
00:17:55,035 --> 00:17:56,519
- Look, Jeremiah, we're
just trying to create

315
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,963
a little progress here.

316
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,113
And the people seem to agree with us.

317
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,063
Now, as much as I'd love
to have your support,

318
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,053
all due respect, we, we
don't really need it.

319
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,194
- Well, with all due respect, Burt,

320
00:18:13,195 --> 00:18:14,469
if you're still planning
on building that tunnel

321
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,309
for that choo choo, I'd reconsider,

322
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,299
slow down a tad.

323
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,343
If you know what I mean.

324
00:18:23,106 --> 00:18:25,773
(men muttering)

325
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:28,708
- Bye.

326
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,680
(cautious music)

327
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,663
- Maybe it's where we were standing.

328
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,673
- This is where we were standing.

329
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,593
- Keep trying.

330
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,423
- How can a cave take
us to some other time?

331
00:19:03,665 --> 00:19:06,079
- Oh, this is hopeless.

332
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,239
We better get back.

333
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,919
- Let's get Jeremiah to help us.

334
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,259
- Jeremiah?

335
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,360
We've been gone too long!

336
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,361
Come on.

337
00:19:22,557 --> 00:19:23,546
(Dylan gasps)

338
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:24,506
(mountain lion roars)

339
00:19:24,506 --> 00:19:25,506
Run, Nicole!

340
00:19:27,329 --> 00:19:28,746
Come on, run!

341
00:19:28,747 --> 00:19:30,330
It's gonna eat you!

342
00:19:32,225 --> 00:19:34,339
Faster, Nicole, run!

343
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,184
Come on!
- It's gaining on us!

344
00:19:37,185 --> 00:19:39,704
- [Dylan] Run! Faster!

345
00:19:39,705 --> 00:19:41,344
(horse whinnying)

346
00:19:41,345 --> 00:19:42,178
Whoa.

347
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:43,270
(Nichole gasps)

348
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:46,614
(horse whinnying)

349
00:19:46,615 --> 00:19:47,897
- [Nicole] Come on, Dylan.

350
00:19:47,898 --> 00:19:48,898
- Nicole!

351
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:54,148
(mountain lion roaring)

352
00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:55,149
Uh uh!

353
00:20:02,957 --> 00:20:05,790
(tentative music)

354
00:20:44,489 --> 00:20:46,219
This is good.

355
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,673
- It is snake eyes.

356
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,809
(all laughing)

357
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,504
It is a corn mix.

358
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:57,088
(all laughing)

359
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:05,711
(video game guns blasting)

360
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:18,731
(toy siren wailing)

361
00:21:20,765 --> 00:21:23,432
(serious music)

362
00:21:26,641 --> 00:21:28,079
- Where do you come from?

363
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,229
- From our parents' house in Portland.

364
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,999
- Did you come to our mountain on horses?

365
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,983
- No, through the cave.

366
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,069
- Quickly, get the chief.

367
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,533
- [Nicole] Will the chief know
where to find our parents?

368
00:21:45,176 --> 00:21:46,513
- You came through the cave?

369
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,879
Alone?

370
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,669
- Yeah, our parents were making lunch.

371
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:54,249
They trust us to go by ourselves.

372
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,300
- [Jeremiah] Yeah, at least
you'll listen to somebody.

373
00:21:56,301 --> 00:21:58,398
- [Dylan And Nicole] Jeremiah!

374
00:21:58,399 --> 00:21:59,250
- Been lookin' all over for you.

375
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,019
I was worried sick about you two.

376
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,239
It's not safe for you to be up

377
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,529
in these mountains, especially now.

378
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,680
You gotta listen to me.

379
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,013
- Very sad time, Jeremiah.

380
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,709
- I'm embarrassed for my people, Chief.

381
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,979
I'm sorry.

382
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,799
- I know they are not your people.

383
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,493
Together we must defeat them.

384
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,849
(gentle music)

385
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,459
- We're going to have to do
whatever we can to stop them.

386
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,113
- We won't run away again.

387
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,879
Please don't hurt us.

388
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,409
- We weren't talking about you.

389
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,310
Nobody's gonna hurt you

390
00:22:30,311 --> 00:22:31,410
as long as I'm around.

391
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,689
Those bad guys I was telling you about,

392
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,559
they came up here to
destroy the mountains.

393
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,359
They're gonna blow holes in the earth

394
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,169
and tear out the trees.

395
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:41,620
Till we stop 'em, it's
not gonna be safe for you.

396
00:22:43,765 --> 00:22:45,165
- What's going on, Jeremiah?

397
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,433
- I want you kids to stay
with these nice people.

398
00:22:50,428 --> 00:22:51,261
I'll get you home.

399
00:22:51,262 --> 00:22:56,261
I promise.

400
00:23:03,975 --> 00:23:06,558
(lively music)

401
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,809
- Looks perfect, Betty.

402
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:13,790
How'd you do it?

403
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:16,119
- Oh, just don't you
trouble yourself, Mayor.

404
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,159
You just make sure that
you're real convincing

405
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,769
when you tell those people it's real.

406
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,709
- Well now, if I do that,

407
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,039
there's gonna be a hailstorm
of people through here,

408
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,689
the likes of which this town
ain't never seen before.

409
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,779
- That's exactly right.

410
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,569
And whether there's gold or not,

411
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,729
we won't be able to count all the money

412
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,789
we're going to make from the railroads,

413
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,223
the boarding houses, the
hotels, the bars, the works.

414
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:46,106
Oh, and all because of
my wise old Mayor Bronch.

415
00:23:46,107 --> 00:23:47,533
- (laughing) Well, now.

416
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,129
I just hope for your sake

417
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,939
that you can make it all happen

418
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,409
before the bank needs the money

419
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,339
to close on all that land.

420
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,849
Or before somebody really
starts checking out

421
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,373
these rocks you been hiding.

422
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,639
- How sweet of you to worry, Mayor.

423
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,049
- Now, Betty, you know,
people around here,

424
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,929
they like old Jeremiah.

425
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:09,199
The Indians too, for that matter.

426
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,033
No, I think-

427
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:12,779
- I'm not payin' you to think, Mayor.

428
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,939
No more than those silly
people are gonna be thinking

429
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,809
whenever we ask 'em to do anything

430
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:19,653
for a chance to get rich.

431
00:24:20,997 --> 00:24:23,779
(Mayor chuckling)

432
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,197
(door opens)

433
00:24:29,096 --> 00:24:30,096
- Uh, no.

434
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,669
No, I don't see anything in here

435
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:35,339
about any Indian land rights.

436
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,239
- Oh, the Indians don't
care what land their on.

437
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,469
They're not gonna mind moving that little

438
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,479
village of theirs to
a new mountain either.

439
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,524
Especially when they see
what's happening to this one.

440
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:46,108
(all laughing)

441
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:51,019
- Well, thank you kindly,
Mayor, for checking for me.

442
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:51,957
- Oh, you're welcome, Miss Betty.

443
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:54,749
- And I guess I'll see
you at the town meeting.

444
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,590
- Oh, this town meeting
sure is exciting, isn't it?

445
00:24:57,591 --> 00:24:58,829
It's just rewarding to know that we're

446
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,429
helping all these fine townspeople.

447
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:04,053
Well, Mr. Mayor, good afternoon.

448
00:25:10,806 --> 00:25:13,389
(lively music)

449
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,500
(Betty sighs)

450
00:25:15,501 --> 00:25:17,699
Believe I got the mayor on our side.

451
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,500
- Probably more than you know, dear.

452
00:25:32,635 --> 00:25:35,369
- [Dylan] There's got to be
a road around here somewhere.

453
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,420
- [Nicole] I hope so.

454
00:25:47,656 --> 00:25:49,991
♪ Fake gold, fake gold ♪

455
00:25:49,992 --> 00:25:52,492
(man humming)

456
00:25:56,297 --> 00:25:58,630
♪ Fake gold ♪

457
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,263
Oh, this ought to be
perfect, right over there.

458
00:26:07,972 --> 00:26:09,305
I'm all right...

459
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:11,032
Whoa!

460
00:26:11,033 --> 00:26:12,969
(funny music)

461
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,325
Hey!

462
00:26:14,326 --> 00:26:15,858
Help!

463
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:16,859
Help!

464
00:26:18,023 --> 00:26:19,278
Roscoe!

465
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,315
Jones!

466
00:26:20,316 --> 00:26:21,316
Help me!

467
00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:23,659
Help!

468
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:31,499
- Jonesy, gimme some more of them things.

469
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,817
Come on, give 'em to me.

470
00:26:32,818 --> 00:26:35,287
(sneaky music)

471
00:26:35,288 --> 00:26:36,121
Come on, give me.

472
00:26:36,121 --> 00:26:37,110
Oh!

473
00:26:37,111 --> 00:26:38,469
I said give 'em to me,

474
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,738
not throw 'em at me.

475
00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:40,739
Geez!

476
00:26:53,905 --> 00:26:55,655
- What are you doin'?

477
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:00,219
- Well, isn't it just
like you to go swimming

478
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,269
while the rest of us is working.

479
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,419
- What are you talking about?

480
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,772
Swimmin'?
- Yeah.

481
00:27:05,773 --> 00:27:07,519
- I almost drowned out there.

482
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,906
- Drowned.
- What are you, crazy?

483
00:27:08,907 --> 00:27:10,129
- Oh boy, oh boy.
- You know I was yellin'

484
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:10,963
your name.

485
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:12,169
I don't know where the heck you was.

486
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,003
- I didn't hear a thing.

487
00:27:13,003 --> 00:27:13,836
I was working.

488
00:27:13,837 --> 00:27:15,349
- You know.

489
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,546
I wasn't swimming in my clothes.

490
00:27:17,547 --> 00:27:19,140
Now give me some more of them-there rocks.

491
00:27:19,141 --> 00:27:21,119
(men muttering)

492
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,489
- [Dylan] Hey, can we
get a ride into town?

493
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,596
(tense music)

494
00:27:25,597 --> 00:27:26,597
- Hide 'em!

495
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,419
- Will you give us a ride to town?

496
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,469
- Why sure, kids.

497
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,876
Jump on in.

498
00:27:33,877 --> 00:27:36,119
We's just on our way into town ourselves.

499
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,789
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

500
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,059
Well come on, right over here, little man.

501
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,018
Step right up.

502
00:27:40,018 --> 00:27:40,851
That's it.

503
00:27:40,851 --> 00:27:41,684
Come here, little lady.

504
00:27:41,685 --> 00:27:43,086
Right over here, step right up.

505
00:27:43,087 --> 00:27:43,920
That's it.

506
00:27:43,921 --> 00:27:45,746
Come on, little man.

507
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,312
Right there.

508
00:27:47,313 --> 00:27:48,313
There we go.

509
00:27:54,396 --> 00:27:57,239
(peaceful music)

510
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,689
- [Dylan] Thanks, mister.

511
00:27:58,690 --> 00:27:59,673
- Sure.

512
00:27:59,674 --> 00:28:01,999
- hat were you doing in the woods?

513
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,702
- Uh, well little man, I, uh,

514
00:28:04,703 --> 00:28:07,143
I was looking for
rattlesnakes in the grass.

515
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:10,720
Make darn good belts,
you know. (tongue clucks)

516
00:28:10,721 --> 00:28:12,899
- Were you throwin' rocks at 'em?

517
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,567
It looked like you had some shiny rocks.

518
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,039
(man spits)

519
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,919
- No, no, no, no.

520
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,459
Them's, them's my rattlers.

521
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,908
Yeah, see.

522
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,033
Right there, right there.

523
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,059
(Roscoe hisses)

524
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,947
Brings 'em out quiet, real quiet,

525
00:28:26,948 --> 00:28:29,280
shh, then wham! (laughs)

526
00:28:29,281 --> 00:28:30,173
You got 'em!

527
00:28:30,173 --> 00:28:31,173
Ooh.

528
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,629
- Are we almost in town yet?

529
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,703
- Oh, little lady, we're almost there.

530
00:28:38,623 --> 00:28:40,900
Ooh, gah, my hand.

531
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,363
- Where do you think them kids

532
00:28:43,364 --> 00:28:45,493
got those funny lookin' clothes?

533
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,119
- You know, Jonesy, you
shouldn't ought to make fun

534
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,722
of the less fortunate.

535
00:28:50,723 --> 00:28:53,473
(peaceful music)

536
00:28:55,751 --> 00:28:56,899
- So I say to you,

537
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,579
if you want your businesses to grow.

538
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,459
If you want progress, prosperity

539
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,929
and a thriving community.

540
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:08,239
If you want your children
to have a better life,

541
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,723
then vote for the railroad
and mountain development plan.

542
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,319
I thank you all.

543
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,370
- We're all behind you, Burt.

544
00:29:18,371 --> 00:29:21,967
(people cheering)

545
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:24,379
- Well, thank you, Burt.

546
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,373
Now we'll hear from Jeremiah.

547
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,452
- Thank you, Mayor.

548
00:29:36,453 --> 00:29:38,149
Well, I don't know all you folks,

549
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:41,689
so it'd be wrong of me to tell
you how to live your lives.

550
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,883
It's not my place.

551
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:47,369
But the ones of you that
I do know are good people.

552
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,639
You want the best for your families.

553
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,179
You like to be treated with respect.

554
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:56,629
All I want you to do is
to stick by your beliefs.

555
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,388
Progress comes from good hard work,

556
00:29:59,389 --> 00:30:00,819
(gentle music)

557
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,683
not from a get-rich-quick
scheme from a developer.

558
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,193
It comes with respect,

559
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,629
respect for future generations,

560
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:12,776
respect for the chief
here and for his people,

561
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,483
for this beautiful countryside,

562
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,133
respect for the animals.

563
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,283
This is their home too.

564
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,190
As far as the railroad

565
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,010
and building this little town

566
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:30,603
too quick, too fast will destroy it.

567
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:33,549
Think about your beliefs.

568
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,850
Then listen to your heart.

569
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,130
Thank you.

570
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,269
- Jeremiah's right.

571
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,994
I saw what happened in Calico.

572
00:30:49,995 --> 00:30:52,759
A lot of people you
don't want came around.

573
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,029
And when a boom town goes bust,

574
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,003
those kind of folks turn to crime.

575
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:04,940
- Well, we've, we've heard
quite a bit here tonight.

576
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,919
I suppose.

577
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,753
- Gold!

578
00:31:09,753 --> 00:31:10,586
Gold!

579
00:31:10,586 --> 00:31:11,479
I found gold!

580
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,798
(people shouting)

581
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,549
Jimmy's got some too.

582
00:31:16,632 --> 00:31:18,203
- Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen,

583
00:31:18,204 --> 00:31:19,187
some order, please.

584
00:31:19,188 --> 00:31:20,569
- We're gonna be rich, woo!

585
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:22,493
- Ladies and gentlemen, order, please.

586
00:31:24,543 --> 00:31:27,639
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
a little order here, please.

587
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,833
What I want to know is, is it real?

588
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:34,711
Virgil, let me see that rock.

589
00:31:34,712 --> 00:31:37,379
(anxious music)

590
00:31:55,603 --> 00:31:59,770
People, all we have here is

591
00:32:02,085 --> 00:32:04,326
100 percent pure gold!

592
00:32:04,327 --> 00:32:08,244
(people cheering and clapping)

593
00:32:13,904 --> 00:32:15,982
And if there are.

594
00:32:15,983 --> 00:32:19,049
Folks, folks, if there aren't anymore

595
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,979
unreasonable arguments,

596
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,299
I feel it my duty as
mayor to allow Burt here

597
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,045
to put the town of Saragosa on the map.

598
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:29,999
(people cheering)

599
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,609
And he can do that by
running that railroad

600
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,313
right by the edge of town!

601
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,159
And effective tomorrow,

602
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,979
you have every right to blow
that cave to dig your tunnel.

603
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,409
And you can continue logging the mountain

604
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,329
for all the lumber we're gonna need

605
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,249
for this coming gold rush and the building

606
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,438
of our new big city!

607
00:32:50,439 --> 00:32:54,356
(people cheering and clapping)

608
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:00,017
- We really did go back in time.

609
00:33:00,018 --> 00:33:01,591
- And if they blow up the mountain,

610
00:33:01,592 --> 00:33:02,642
we'll never get home.

611
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,265
- We gotta stop them.

612
00:33:05,266 --> 00:33:08,016
(dramatic music)

613
00:33:10,339 --> 00:33:13,006
(air whooshing)

614
00:33:15,116 --> 00:33:17,783
- Nicole, Dylan!
- Nicole, Dylan!

615
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,899
- [Mom] No luck?

616
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,900
- I'll gonna the police.

617
00:33:31,987 --> 00:33:34,654
(phone beeping)

618
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,853
- Did you get through?

619
00:33:38,854 --> 00:33:39,687
(phone beeping)

620
00:33:39,688 --> 00:33:40,759
- This thing isn't working out here!

621
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,822
How come these things never work

622
00:33:41,823 --> 00:33:43,173
when you need 'em the most?

623
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,770
We gotta look ourselves.

624
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:48,049
- And we need more people looking

625
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,700
or the police that know the area.

626
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:51,990
- You're right.

627
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:54,579
It should be dark soon.

628
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,629
By the time we get to the police station

629
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,630
or even find a phone out here who knows?

630
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,243
- Yeah, the kids are gonna
think we deserted them.

631
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,566
- Or they're walking into the hands

632
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:05,073
of the wrong kind of people.

633
00:34:08,905 --> 00:34:12,288
(air whooshing)

634
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:14,789
(tense music)

635
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:19,703
- All right.

636
00:34:19,704 --> 00:34:21,509
Take this to the marshal.

637
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,803
He's the only one that can stop 'em.

638
00:34:23,804 --> 00:34:25,099
It's gonna take you
half a day to get there,

639
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,883
So ride like the wind and be careful.

640
00:34:29,752 --> 00:34:30,954
- Ya!

641
00:34:30,955 --> 00:34:34,043
(horse whinnies)

642
00:34:34,044 --> 00:34:35,919
- The message will get there, my brother.

643
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,753
So now we wait.

644
00:34:48,126 --> 00:34:49,410
(animal roaring)

645
00:34:49,411 --> 00:34:50,641
- Whoa!
- What is that?

646
00:34:50,642 --> 00:34:52,892
- [Dylan] Nicole, get back.

647
00:34:55,253 --> 00:34:56,653
- [Both] It's a bear!

648
00:35:00,525 --> 00:35:03,119
(bear roars)

649
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,120
- [Dylan] He's huge!

650
00:35:05,379 --> 00:35:07,249
- (chuckling) Come on, Jack.

651
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,899
What are you doing scaring my new friends?

652
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,319
You stop it.

653
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,409
You leave 'em alone now.

654
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,809
You go off and play.

655
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:13,643
Come on, kids.

656
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:14,849
Come on.

657
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,022
Jack, go on, go on.

658
00:35:16,023 --> 00:35:17,423
Go down to the river.

659
00:35:18,812 --> 00:35:19,645
Sit down, kids.

660
00:35:19,645 --> 00:35:20,645
I'm sorry.

661
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,293
Jack's harmless.

662
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,889
So I guess you guys thought you'd leave

663
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:33,459
the chief's village and
bring Jack home to me, huh?

664
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,288
- He lives in your house?

665
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:36,699
(gentle music)

666
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,849
- Well, I wouldn't say he
actually lives in the house,

667
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:42,859
but he comes by to see me once in a while.

668
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,319
- His name is Jack?

669
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,869
He looks so mean.

670
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:47,740
- Ah, not Jack.

671
00:35:47,741 --> 00:35:49,049
He's not mean.

672
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,589
He looks mean when he's hungry.

673
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:55,159
He comes by to get a meal
from me once in a while.

674
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,738
- As long as it's from you and not me.

675
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:01,349
- (chuckling) Well, Jack
likes most everybody.

676
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,889
One guy Jack don't like though,

677
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:05,493
and that's that old boss man.

678
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,709
- Will he help stop boss man

679
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,099
from blowing up the mountain then?

680
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,409
- Well, you're a pretty smart little lady.

681
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,379
How'd you know he was plannin' to do that?

682
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,853
- Why didn't you tell us?

683
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,519
- Well, I figure you kids have
been through so much already

684
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,599
that I didn't want to scare you

685
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,389
once they started blowing
holes in all these mountains.

686
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,789
- Then we'll never get back.

687
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,596
Isn't there somebody
who can tell the mayor

688
00:36:27,597 --> 00:36:29,063
to not let 'em do it?

689
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,212
- Well, I've already taken care of that.

690
00:36:33,213 --> 00:36:35,026
I have a real good friend
of mine that's a marshal,

691
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:36,399
and I sent for him.

692
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,019
- Can he stop them?

693
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,153
- Well, he sure can.

694
00:36:40,008 --> 00:36:42,569
But we got to wait for him to get back.

695
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:45,469
While we're waiting,
I'm gonna figure out how

696
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:48,319
to keep you kids from going to those caves

697
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,073
and sneaking into town
every time I turn my back.

698
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,569
- We have to find our parents, Jeremiah.

699
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:58,119
- Yeah, and we want to
help you stop boss man too.

700
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,169
- We've got something that you can do,

701
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,939
but while we're waiting,

702
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,690
I got something I want to show you.

703
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:12,559
(peaceful music)

704
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,560
This is it.

705
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,490
Isn't this beautiful?

706
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,233
These are the mountains
where all the animals live.

707
00:37:21,476 --> 00:37:22,804
You know, the Indians have lived here

708
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:24,083
almost as long as the animals.

709
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,323
- This is beautiful.

710
00:37:51,324 --> 00:37:52,479
- Cool.

711
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,599
- Yeah, it is beautiful, isn't it?

712
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,650
Let me help you down.

713
00:37:57,605 --> 00:37:58,938
Can you make it?

714
00:37:59,925 --> 00:38:01,092
That's a girl.

715
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,169
You want to see something
really beautiful?

716
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:07,243
Look just up above that tree.

717
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:08,077
(bird screeching)

718
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:09,319
That's a golden eagle.

719
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,433
His name is Thor.

720
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,943
Let me see if I can call him down.

721
00:38:13,827 --> 00:38:15,101
(Jeremiah whistles)

722
00:38:15,102 --> 00:38:16,102
Yaw!

723
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,172
Yaw, Thor!

724
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,500
- [Nicole] Look at his wings.

725
00:38:26,507 --> 00:38:27,507
- Whoa.

726
00:38:29,425 --> 00:38:32,175
Look at him floating in the wind.

727
00:38:35,569 --> 00:38:36,569
- Yaw, Thor.

728
00:38:39,788 --> 00:38:41,927
(Jeremiah whistles)

729
00:38:41,928 --> 00:38:43,095
Here he comes.

730
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,033
How's my boy?

731
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
How you doing?

732
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,333
I've been missing ya.

733
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,969
- Do you know him too?

734
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,769
- [Jeremiah] (chuckles)
Old Thor's been my friend

735
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,139
for a long time.

736
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,049
- I bet Thor never stayed
at your house before.

737
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,019
- He did for a while when he was hurt.

738
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,619
I was helping him get better.

739
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,089
He stayed for a week or two.

740
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:13,989
- Did you ever do anything nice for Jack?

741
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,514
- Jack and I are good old friends.

742
00:39:15,515 --> 00:39:17,649
- Good, because here he comes now.

743
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:18,483
(Jack roaring)

744
00:39:18,484 --> 00:39:19,825
- Jack.
- Hello, Jack.

745
00:39:19,826 --> 00:39:22,576
(peaceful music)

746
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:28,119
Well, I heard this little
bear make this sound.

747
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,289
And I looked under the brush,

748
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:30,679
and there this bear was.

749
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,956
And his mama was laying
dead on the ground there.

750
00:39:32,957 --> 00:39:34,299
And I saw this little bear,

751
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,689
and I said, "Come here, little guy."

752
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:39,490
And I leaned down and all of
a sudden I heard this whoo.

753
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,889
Well, my heart was pounding.

754
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:43,929
I mean, I thought my heart was gonna jump

755
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,459
right out of my shirt.

756
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,539
And I turned around, and
I looked up at that bear.

757
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,579
I'm about six feet tall.

758
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:53,839
This bear must've been 10 feet tall.

759
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,589
That bear must have weighed 1,600 pounds.

760
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:00,099
I mean, his head was so
big that my shoulders

761
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,889
could fit in between his ears,

762
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:05,189
and his paw, when he stood
on a piece of wet earth,

763
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:08,289
his par was at least that big.

764
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:10,169
And his claws were that long.

765
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,516
Well, I picked up that little black bear,

766
00:40:11,517 --> 00:40:13,689
and I was running as fast as I could.

767
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:14,523
And I looked behind me,

768
00:40:14,524 --> 00:40:17,386
and I could hear that big
giant grizzly bear just whoo.

769
00:40:17,387 --> 00:40:19,739
And he got closer and closer to me,

770
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,846
and there was nowhere I could go.

771
00:40:20,847 --> 00:40:22,719
And all of a sudden that little bear,

772
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,670
he was so frightened,

773
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,159
he grabbed me and he bit me by the arm.

774
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,979
And I dropped the little bear.

775
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,749
And as I went to reach
for the little bear,

776
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:31,387
and I said, "We made it a
little Jack, we made it."

777
00:40:32,288 --> 00:40:34,705
(calm music)

778
00:41:16,934 --> 00:41:17,767
- Ya!

779
00:41:17,768 --> 00:41:20,517
(dramatic music)

780
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:33,498
(horse approaching)

781
00:41:33,499 --> 00:41:36,166
(curious music)

782
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,720
- Where can I find Marshal Jackson?

783
00:41:45,154 --> 00:41:47,654
- If you got any bad news,
he's gone till morning.

784
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,549
If you got some good news,
you're looking at him.

785
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,290
- I was sent by my chief Tuyonka

786
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,340
and by your friend, Jeremiah.

787
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,307
- How can I help you?

788
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,419
(horse whinnying)

789
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,837
(calm music)

790
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,879
Is Jeremiah all right?

791
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,880
- Yes, sir, he is.

792
00:42:12,659 --> 00:42:14,559
He wanted me to give you that message.

793
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,273
- How come he didn't bring it himself?

794
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,913
- [Man] He has his hands full, sir.

795
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,699
- And we find ourselves with
the gravely serious problem

796
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:32,599
of stopping them before
they destroy the mountain

797
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,233
and it's forest.

798
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:38,269
The mayor has approved
their destruction to serve

799
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:39,473
the reckless greed.

800
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,803
I can't do anything about this.

801
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,069
- [Man] Sir?

802
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:49,253
- Well, the mayor has jurisdiction here,

803
00:42:50,436 --> 00:42:53,386
and as long as they're not
doing anything illegal up there,

804
00:42:54,468 --> 00:42:56,250
well, I mean, it says right here

805
00:42:58,633 --> 00:43:00,283
that the mayor gave his approval.

806
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:03,653
- But it's our home, sir.

807
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,320
- Can't stop him.

808
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,248
I am sorry.

809
00:43:10,249 --> 00:43:12,665
(calm music)

810
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,903
- Jeremiah said to tell you
he was counting on you, sir.

811
00:43:20,705 --> 00:43:23,538
(horse whinnying)

812
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,300
- Come on, kids.

813
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:56,829
Why don't you leave those behind?

814
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:57,800
They're gonna slow you down.

815
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,633
- No.

816
00:43:58,633 --> 00:43:59,633
We're used to it.

817
00:44:00,623 --> 00:44:02,368
- It's okay with you, Nicole?

818
00:44:02,369 --> 00:44:03,207
- Yeah.

819
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:04,705
- Well, you kids know best.

820
00:44:04,706 --> 00:44:07,873
(light, lively music)

821
00:44:21,386 --> 00:44:24,386
(suspenseful music)

822
00:44:35,498 --> 00:44:37,131
(men laughing)

823
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:39,799
There they are right down there.

824
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,203
- [Burt] What in the blue
blazes is goin' on here?

825
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:45,969
Oh, Jones, get up.

826
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:48,509
- We're gonna have to stop these guys?

827
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:49,769
- Well, unfortunately, Dylan,

828
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,020
these guys are as
dangerous as they are dumb.

829
00:44:53,269 --> 00:44:54,465
Come on.

830
00:44:54,466 --> 00:44:55,466
Be quiet.

831
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:57,818
(sneaky music)

832
00:44:57,819 --> 00:45:00,720
- [Burt] Now load the dynamite
on the wagon and get going.

833
00:45:04,942 --> 00:45:06,339
- Now, I want you kids to stay here.

834
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,173
All right?

835
00:45:07,174 --> 00:45:08,529
Promise me you'll stay here.

836
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:10,580
I got some business I gotta take care of.

837
00:45:22,392 --> 00:45:23,988
- Come on, let's go.

838
00:45:23,989 --> 00:45:27,489
(light adventurous music)

839
00:45:32,754 --> 00:45:35,337
(sneaky music)

840
00:45:53,973 --> 00:45:56,390
(busy music)

841
00:46:46,287 --> 00:46:48,713
Come on, Jeremiah's going to be back soon.

842
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:53,999
- Where have you two been?

843
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,099
- We were watching the
mining company for you.

844
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,539
- You know, I can get Jack that old bear

845
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,239
to mind me better than you two.

846
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,769
Do you think you could follow me to town

847
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:02,833
without getting lost?

848
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:05,712
Come on.

849
00:47:05,713 --> 00:47:06,963
- We're right behind you.

850
00:47:07,805 --> 00:47:09,202
- Good.

851
00:47:09,203 --> 00:47:11,786
(gentle music)

852
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:29,119
All right, I want you to follow me.

853
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,120
Walk right behind me up past

854
00:47:30,121 --> 00:47:32,129
the mayor's office, you understand?

855
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:34,030
Wait for me out behind the barbershop.

856
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,173
Now, will you wait for
me this time, please?

857
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,140
Excuse me, Mayor.

858
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:50,043
- [Mayor] Where you off to

859
00:47:50,044 --> 00:47:52,343
in such an all-fire hurry, Jeremiah?

860
00:47:52,344 --> 00:47:54,299
- Howdy, Mayor and Mr. Mountain Man.

861
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,300
- [Nicole] Howdy.

862
00:47:55,301 --> 00:47:56,779
- Children.

863
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,239
- Kids.

864
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,929
- Cute kids.

865
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:01,179
Whose are they?

866
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:02,759
- Well, I'm not sure.

867
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,801
They look familiar, though.

868
00:48:04,802 --> 00:48:06,519
I was coming to see you anyway.

869
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,009
I need your help.

870
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,069
I need you to stop Burt for me.

871
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:11,355
- What?

872
00:48:11,356 --> 00:48:14,209
Now, now, Jeremiah, you
saw the town's folks'

873
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:15,769
reaction at that meeting.

874
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:17,799
Why, what they want, he can provide.

875
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,769
And who am I to stop it?

876
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,139
- Now listen, you know as well as I do

877
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:24,229
that nobody's ever taken any
gold out of these mountains.

878
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:26,799
Now, this is a mistake or it's a trick.

879
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,299
- Jeremiah, come on.

880
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,477
These good people, they
know what's right for 'em.

881
00:48:31,478 --> 00:48:33,615
- Oh, Mayor.
(people muttering)

882
00:48:33,616 --> 00:48:36,498
- Tell him, Mayor Bronch.
- We're behind ya.

883
00:48:36,499 --> 00:48:38,829
- You tell him.
- So, why haven't

884
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:40,739
you knuckleheads found any gold

885
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:44,185
like Cyrus here did, hmm, hmm, hmm?

886
00:48:44,186 --> 00:48:47,609
- [Man] Well, I guess
it's like you say, Roscoe.

887
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:49,157
We is just plain stupid.

888
00:48:50,422 --> 00:48:52,622
- [Jones] Who are you
callin' stupid, dummy?

889
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:56,919
- Why don't you jokers
go see if boss man's

890
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,029
back with the wagon so we can get the rest

891
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:00,229
of the dynamite set up hmm?

892
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:03,703
- [Man] I'm goin', Roscoe, I'm goin'.

893
00:49:03,704 --> 00:49:06,471
- Hard to believe my
looks is gonna get better.

894
00:49:06,472 --> 00:49:08,216
Ain't it, Cyrus?

895
00:49:08,217 --> 00:49:11,499
(townspeople shouting)

896
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,309
- Look here, look here, Jeremiah.

897
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:15,829
Now, that mountain don't belong to you

898
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:17,909
any more than it belongs to any one of us.

899
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:19,339
Ain't that right?

900
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:20,549
But that doesn't mean I can't stop 'em

901
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:22,029
from destroying this mountain,

902
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:24,059
from destroying the Indians' homes,

903
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,373
the animals land, and for what?

904
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,549
For some silly greed
that's gonna go up in smoke

905
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:30,819
just like this mountain is.

906
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,519
- But you don't know that, Jeremiah.

907
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,353
That's all we're saying.

908
00:49:33,354 --> 00:49:34,640
- Yeah, tell him.
- Yeah.

909
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,259
- Well, I do know that Burt doesn't have

910
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,357
to blow this mountain up
to build that railroad.

911
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:40,471
(dramatic music)

912
00:49:40,472 --> 00:49:43,570
(townspeople muttering)

913
00:49:43,571 --> 00:49:46,404
(horse whinnying)

914
00:50:01,371 --> 00:50:02,371
- Whoa.

915
00:50:04,742 --> 00:50:08,649
You know, Betty, once
we get this town going

916
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:13,650
and well, get ourselves
a nice little nest egg

917
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:15,343
and town people are all happy,

918
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,450
what do you say you and me get...

919
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:23,099
- Uh, Burt, I really think that we should

920
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,889
like turn this around
and head back to town.

921
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:27,049
- Well, I will, in a minute, Betty.

922
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:29,669
I just, well, I think there's some things

923
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:31,789
that we haven't really
stopped to talk about.

924
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:32,660
Like-

925
00:50:32,661 --> 00:50:34,139
- Like when to blow up the mountain?

926
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:34,973
Oh, I know.

927
00:50:34,974 --> 00:50:36,369
See, I really think that we should invite

928
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:37,203
all the townspeople.

929
00:50:37,203 --> 00:50:38,036
- No, no.
- I mean,

930
00:50:38,037 --> 00:50:39,076
I know how much you care about 'em,

931
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:40,126
and well, I mean, we all care

932
00:50:40,127 --> 00:50:41,509
- Betty, I-
- I care.

933
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:43,116
It's just well, you know,

934
00:50:43,117 --> 00:50:44,239
I just don't want to
see anybody in danger.

935
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,609
And then there's that darn Jeremiah.

936
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:48,279
I know he's gonna do anything
he can to try and stop us.

937
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,144
- Betty-
- So you know

938
00:50:49,144 --> 00:50:49,977
what I think we should do?

939
00:50:49,978 --> 00:50:51,049
I think we should just go
ahead and do it right now.

940
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:53,009
- Betty, I'm gonna blow the mountain.

941
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:53,843
- Burt!

942
00:50:53,844 --> 00:50:55,289
We should go ahead and do this now.

943
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:57,219
Now come on, honey,
turn this thing around.

944
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,422
- Betty, honey, I want
to talk to you about-

945
00:50:58,423 --> 00:50:59,423
- Burt!

946
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:01,370
Now.

947
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:05,493
Let's go, now.

948
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:09,830
- Ha!

949
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:19,629
(air whooshing)

950
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:21,639
- Well, I'm doing a final evaluation

951
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,969
for a proposed development
site for the state.

952
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:25,759
That's why we're here.

953
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,809
- Mighty pretty country up here.

954
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:29,979
I hate to see all this ruined.

955
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,680
- Actually, we hope to enhance it.

956
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:33,910
- Yeah, sure.

957
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:35,673
Anyway.

958
00:51:35,674 --> 00:51:37,605
(melancholy music)

959
00:51:37,606 --> 00:51:39,469
What we've got here is an
intensified search team

960
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:41,909
that's been in this area and
found absolutely nothing.

961
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:43,939
What we're going to have to do is fan out,

962
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:46,417
cover a lot more ground than we have.

963
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,969
- Megan, darling, Mom and Dad will be back

964
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:53,599
in a little while, okay,

965
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,050
with your brother and sister.

966
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:58,170
- Stay with the captain, honey.

967
00:51:58,171 --> 00:51:59,898
We'll be back shortly.

968
00:51:59,899 --> 00:52:00,899
Okay.

969
00:52:05,496 --> 00:52:08,163
(air whooshing)

970
00:52:10,088 --> 00:52:11,088
- Whoa.

971
00:52:11,906 --> 00:52:13,513
(man whinnying)

972
00:52:13,514 --> 00:52:15,153
(funny music)

973
00:52:15,154 --> 00:52:17,259
- I can't believe boss man stranded us.

974
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,409
- Well, you never can tell what he'll do

975
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:21,088
when he's with Miss Betty.

976
00:52:21,089 --> 00:52:21,922
(men laughing)

977
00:52:21,923 --> 00:52:24,517
- Or what Miss Betty'll do to him.

978
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,393
Hey, look, my nice comfy boots.

979
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,183
- [Roscoe] Ah, home sweet home.

980
00:52:34,811 --> 00:52:35,815
(slide whistle blowing)

981
00:52:35,816 --> 00:52:38,458
(Roscoe yells)

982
00:52:38,459 --> 00:52:40,292
- [Man] What happened?

983
00:52:41,753 --> 00:52:46,086
- (laughing) What a bunch of fools!

984
00:52:47,276 --> 00:52:51,621
You guys are the stupidest
people I ever saw.

985
00:52:51,622 --> 00:52:53,955
- [Roscoe] Oh, God, my nose.

986
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:56,392
(bucket rattling)

987
00:52:56,393 --> 00:52:58,079
- What's so funny, Jones?

988
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,957
What are you bone-headed
nitwits doing now?

989
00:53:05,886 --> 00:53:07,859
- [Roscoe] I think they got us, boss.

990
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,509
- Yeah.

991
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:11,763
- Stop fooling around and get over here!

992
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:16,620
All right.

993
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:19,670
Don't drip on me!

994
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,599
Go down the hill, get the wagon,

995
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,809
bring the horses up here,
and get 'em watered, will ya?

996
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:30,563
- Go down the hill, get the wagon,

997
00:53:30,564 --> 00:53:32,043
- No, you!
- And bring the horses.

998
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,239
- No!

999
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,240
Me.

1000
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:41,463
- You go inside and see how
much dynamite we have left.

1001
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:44,966
And Roscoe.
- Yeah.

1002
00:53:44,967 --> 00:53:47,129
- Get that dynamite away from me.

1003
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:48,409
- Sure, boss.

1004
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:50,493
- Today!
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

1005
00:53:51,867 --> 00:53:52,867
Goo!

1006
00:53:53,569 --> 00:53:56,319
(perilous music)

1007
00:53:58,439 --> 00:53:59,439
Gimme that.

1008
00:54:02,791 --> 00:54:04,041
I got it, boss.

1009
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:07,236
(playful music)

1010
00:54:07,237 --> 00:54:08,237
- What the?

1011
00:54:10,961 --> 00:54:12,128
- Oh.
- Oh, my.

1012
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:15,847
Boss man.

1013
00:54:15,848 --> 00:54:18,598
(Jones laughing)

1014
00:54:19,469 --> 00:54:20,469
- Shut up!

1015
00:54:21,705 --> 00:54:22,705
Idiots!

1016
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,873
- See, Mayor, what
could possibly go wrong?

1017
00:54:29,909 --> 00:54:34,909
- [Mayor] This.

1018
00:54:37,637 --> 00:54:39,274
- Shh.

1019
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:40,525
Here they come.

1020
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:46,549
You guys stay right here.

1021
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,629
Jack and I are gonna
go have a look around.

1022
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:49,592
Stay right there.

1023
00:54:49,592 --> 00:54:50,592
Be quiet.

1024
00:54:54,213 --> 00:54:55,676
- [Jones] Ugh.

1025
00:54:55,677 --> 00:54:57,344
- The dynamite, get.

1026
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:05,783
- [Dylan] Hurry, here they come.

1027
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:10,220
- [Nicole] All right, let's go.

1028
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,260
- Plant it here.

1029
00:55:18,261 --> 00:55:19,967
I'm going down by the river.

1030
00:55:29,903 --> 00:55:33,150
- [Jones On Recording] Dummy.

1031
00:55:33,151 --> 00:55:34,151
- What'd you say?

1032
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,650
- I didn't say nothing.

1033
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:48,219
- [Jones On Recording] Dummy.

1034
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,089
- Hey, who are you calling dummy?

1035
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:51,509
This is as good a place as any.

1036
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:53,233
- Well, I didn't say it wasn't.

1037
00:55:58,877 --> 00:55:59,828
- [Bailey On Recording] Stupid.

1038
00:55:59,829 --> 00:56:02,699
- Look, if you want to start something,

1039
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,879
rocks for brains, I'm ready to go.

1040
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:06,713
- Start what?

1041
00:56:06,714 --> 00:56:09,539
I ain't the d-d-dummy calling names, am I?

1042
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:10,814
Come on.

1043
00:56:10,815 --> 00:56:14,479
Come on now.

1044
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,194
You just come.

1045
00:56:16,195 --> 00:56:17,411
Hey, you come on now.
(kids giggling)

1046
00:56:17,412 --> 00:56:19,069
(Jack roaring)

1047
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:19,903
- Whoa!
- Hey!

1048
00:56:19,904 --> 00:56:21,022
- What's the matter boys?

1049
00:56:21,023 --> 00:56:23,209
- G-g-get that thing away from us.

1050
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:25,769
- Now, now, Jeremiah, you and that bear

1051
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:27,126
now take it easy.

1052
00:56:27,127 --> 00:56:29,469
(Jack roars)

1053
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,629
- You all think I can control this bear?

1054
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:33,629
- I'm serious, Jeremiah.

1055
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:36,252
Get that bear away from us.
- Just.

1056
00:56:36,253 --> 00:56:37,489
- Come on back, Jack.

1057
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:39,329
Let's leave 'em alone.

1058
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:41,389
Jack and I don't like the
mountains being destroyed.

1059
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:42,949
You understand me?

1060
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:44,289
So you guys be careful.

1061
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:46,690
Next time I might not be with him.

1062
00:56:46,691 --> 00:56:49,449
(lively banjo music)

1063
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:50,831
- Bye.

1064
00:56:50,832 --> 00:56:51,832
- Bye.

1065
00:56:52,828 --> 00:56:54,668
(Jack roars)

1066
00:56:54,669 --> 00:56:58,252
(Jones and Bailey yelling)

1067
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:05,584
- Hey, Bailey, Jones, I was just planting

1068
00:57:05,585 --> 00:57:07,074
dynamite over there...

1069
00:57:07,075 --> 00:57:08,075
Right over.

1070
00:57:08,968 --> 00:57:09,801
Dagnabbit.

1071
00:57:09,802 --> 00:57:11,369
Where is those two lame brains?

1072
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:12,719
I gotta do everything my.

1073
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,231
It's in plain view, lazy bums.

1074
00:57:15,232 --> 00:57:17,161
- [Dylan] Nicole, watch this.

1075
00:57:17,162 --> 00:57:21,663
Leave Grizzly Mountain alone.

1076
00:57:21,664 --> 00:57:24,081
Leave Grizzly Mountain alone.

1077
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:26,243
- Yes, sir.

1078
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:27,076
I'm leaving.

1079
00:57:27,077 --> 00:57:30,012
I was, I was, uh...

1080
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:31,013
Huh, huh!

1081
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:32,990
Huh, huh!

1082
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:38,989
Boy, these woods is
playing tricks on my mind.

1083
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:40,317
That's it, right on.

1084
00:57:42,565 --> 00:57:43,957
Dagnabbit.

1085
00:57:43,958 --> 00:57:46,959
- [Dylan] I said, leave it alone!

1086
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,266
- All right, you yellow belly.

1087
00:57:48,267 --> 00:57:50,079
You come out here and fight like a man.

1088
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:50,913
Come on.

1089
00:57:50,914 --> 00:57:51,979
I'm right here for you.

1090
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,527
Hiding in the trees is ya?

1091
00:57:53,528 --> 00:57:55,445
(all yelling)

1092
00:57:55,446 --> 00:57:56,943
What are you trying to pull?

1093
00:57:56,944 --> 00:58:00,527
(guns firing on recording)

1094
00:58:02,613 --> 00:58:04,023
- [Bailey] They're comin' for us, Roscoe!

1095
00:58:04,024 --> 00:58:05,389
They're comin' for us!

1096
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:06,223
- Shh.

1097
00:58:06,223 --> 00:58:07,056
Come on.

1098
00:58:07,057 --> 00:58:09,244
I think I see something up there.

1099
00:58:09,245 --> 00:58:10,078
What is that?

1100
00:58:10,078 --> 00:58:11,078
What's that?

1101
00:58:12,279 --> 00:58:15,493
(guns firing on recording)

1102
00:58:15,494 --> 00:58:16,994
- Get 'em, Roscoe.

1103
00:58:24,181 --> 00:58:25,160
- Do it again.

1104
00:58:25,161 --> 00:58:26,346
- Yeah.

1105
00:58:26,347 --> 00:58:27,848
(guns firing on recording)

1106
00:58:27,849 --> 00:58:29,614
(kids giggling)

1107
00:58:29,615 --> 00:58:32,198
(sneaky music)

1108
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:34,650
- Hey, you.

1109
00:58:34,651 --> 00:58:36,333
(kids struggling)

1110
00:58:36,334 --> 00:58:37,643
Oh no, no, no, no.

1111
00:58:37,644 --> 00:58:40,129
No more tricks from either
one of you. (laughing)

1112
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:41,339
Oh, kick and scream all you want.

1113
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:42,878
I don't think Jeremiah's
around to hear you.

1114
00:58:42,879 --> 00:58:45,629
No. (laughing)

1115
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:49,927
- Well, I hope you children
enjoyed your little pranks.

1116
00:58:49,928 --> 00:58:51,889
(men chuckling)

1117
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:55,283
You do know that trespassing
is against the law, don't you?

1118
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:59,620
Have you children ever been in
trouble with the law before?

1119
00:59:03,733 --> 00:59:06,566
(concerned music)

1120
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:14,920
- Dylan?

1121
00:59:16,932 --> 00:59:17,932
Nicole?

1122
00:59:18,683 --> 00:59:19,766
Where are ya?

1123
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:21,860
- Hey.

1124
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:27,069
Hey, how'd you do them there
things with your voices, huh?

1125
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:29,779
- Roscoe.
- Boss, he...

1126
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:31,199
- How do you know Jeremiah?

1127
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,219
- Should we tell him what
we did with the last little

1128
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:34,519
delinquents we caught? (laughing)

1129
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,719
- Jones, please.

1130
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:37,720
- What?

1131
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,921
What little delinquents was that?

1132
00:59:40,922 --> 00:59:41,922
Ow!

1133
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:45,659
Oh, those little delinquents.

1134
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:48,599
- We met him in the woods
a couple of days ago.

1135
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,883
- A couple days ago?

1136
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:52,689
Well, why the devil are
you helping him then?

1137
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:55,659
- Because he's nice, and he helped us.

1138
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:56,809
- Well, that's all well and good,

1139
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:57,680
but what I want to know-

1140
00:59:57,681 --> 01:00:00,149
- And what I want to know is

1141
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:01,389
what are you doing sitting around

1142
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:03,549
talking to two small children?

1143
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:06,804
- Darling, don't sneak
up on a man like that.

1144
01:00:06,805 --> 01:00:08,776
- Um hmm.
- Yeah.

1145
01:00:08,777 --> 01:00:11,180
- May I inquire as to why you four

1146
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:15,533
men have two small children bound here?

1147
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:19,169
- Well, they were the kids
that messed up our plans.

1148
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:20,050
- Untie them.

1149
01:00:20,051 --> 01:00:21,073
Untie them now.

1150
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:24,969
The men had the children
tied when I came in.

1151
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:25,837
I didn't, have-

1152
01:00:25,838 --> 01:00:28,449
- [Betty] And I'm working with you people?

1153
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:29,940
- Oh yes, ma'am.

1154
01:00:29,941 --> 01:00:30,949
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

1155
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:31,950
- Great.

1156
01:00:34,959 --> 01:00:35,959
- Dylan?

1157
01:00:37,263 --> 01:00:38,539
Nicole?

1158
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:40,503
(concerned music)

1159
01:00:40,504 --> 01:00:41,504
Dylan!

1160
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,300
Thor!

1161
01:00:50,003 --> 01:00:51,003
Yaw!

1162
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,839
Yaw, Thor!

1163
01:00:54,158 --> 01:00:56,991
(Thor screeching)

1164
01:00:59,332 --> 01:01:00,165
You're a good boy.

1165
01:01:00,166 --> 01:01:01,617
I knew I could count on you.

1166
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:04,203
This is Dylan's.

1167
01:01:04,204 --> 01:01:06,999
I need you to go find him for me, okay?

1168
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,050
All right, now go on.

1169
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:10,186
You're my eyes in the sky.

1170
01:01:10,187 --> 01:01:11,783
Don't let me down.

1171
01:01:11,784 --> 01:01:14,617
(Thor screeching)

1172
01:01:15,826 --> 01:01:16,826
Dylan?

1173
01:01:19,186 --> 01:01:20,186
Nicole?

1174
01:01:21,996 --> 01:01:22,988
- Dylan?

1175
01:01:22,988 --> 01:01:23,889
Nicole?

1176
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:27,066
(air whooshing)

1177
01:01:27,067 --> 01:01:28,067
Dylan!

1178
01:01:30,255 --> 01:01:31,255
Nicole!

1179
01:01:35,167 --> 01:01:36,167
Dylan!

1180
01:01:37,103 --> 01:01:38,103
Nicole!

1181
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:40,850
- Okay, Gordon, 10-4.

1182
01:01:42,389 --> 01:01:43,509
- Do you think they're okay?

1183
01:01:44,589 --> 01:01:47,230
- Megan, I'll make you a real big promise.

1184
01:01:47,231 --> 01:01:49,064
We'll find those kids.

1185
01:01:50,965 --> 01:01:52,100
- Anything?

1186
01:01:52,101 --> 01:01:52,934
- [Man On Walkie-Talkie]
Unit seven to base.

1187
01:01:52,934 --> 01:01:53,934
Come in base.

1188
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:56,136
- Go ahead.

1189
01:01:56,137 --> 01:01:56,970
- [Man On Walkie-Talkie] Yes, Captain,

1190
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:57,803
I just covered the north face

1191
01:01:57,804 --> 01:01:59,360
of Grizzly Gulch and got nothing.

1192
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,153
- Okay, keep at it.

1193
01:02:01,154 --> 01:02:02,379
Keep me advised.

1194
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:03,213
Over and out.

1195
01:02:03,214 --> 01:02:04,913
Base to unit six, base to unit six.

1196
01:02:05,837 --> 01:02:07,152
- [Unit Six] Unit six here.

1197
01:02:07,153 --> 01:02:07,986
- [Captain] What have you got?

1198
01:02:07,986 --> 01:02:08,819
- [Unit Six] Nothing, Captain.

1199
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:10,349
I'm circling around the lake.

1200
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:11,400
- Okay, over and out.

1201
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:15,139
Folks, just before you got here,

1202
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:17,069
I got a call that fire

1203
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:19,169
down on Juniper Canyon is
spreading out of control,

1204
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:21,449
and I've had to send most
of my people down there.

1205
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:22,939
- How many are left?

1206
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:23,800
- Well, I can only spare a couple.

1207
01:02:23,801 --> 01:02:25,249
- You gotta be kidding.

1208
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:27,239
Our children are out there.

1209
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,563
- Come on, you gotta help us.

1210
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:32,889
- All right.

1211
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:35,329
I'll call town, see if I can
round up a few more volunteers,

1212
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:36,944
but now that's all I can do at this point.

1213
01:02:36,945 --> 01:02:37,945
- Yeah!

1214
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:42,753
Okay, Megan, dear, you
have to come with us.

1215
01:02:54,752 --> 01:02:57,419
(air whooshing)

1216
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:02,619
- [Betty] Just how does Mr. Jeremiah

1217
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:04,339
plan to try and stop us?

1218
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:05,173
- Plan?

1219
01:03:05,174 --> 01:03:06,783
To stop what, ma'am?

1220
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:10,179
- Don't play dumb with me, young man.

1221
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:11,609
You may have outsmarted those dimwits,

1222
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:12,869
but you don't do it with me.

1223
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:13,913
- No, ma'am.

1224
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:17,113
- Such a polite boy.

1225
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,539
The parents of such nice children

1226
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:22,309
couldn't be that far away.

1227
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:25,449
- We, uh, they're gonna meet us here.

1228
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:26,600
- They're on their way.

1229
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:31,349
- Well, you may be nice children,

1230
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:33,159
but I don't believe that
you're helping Jeremiah

1231
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,339
out of the goodness of your hearts

1232
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:36,959
or that your parents are on their way.

1233
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,159
So unless you attempt to redeem yourselves

1234
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,719
by telling me what you
know about Jeremiah's plan,

1235
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:44,269
I'm gonna have the two of
you sent away at sunup.

1236
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:47,127
- And then you'll never
see old Jeremiah again.

1237
01:03:47,128 --> 01:03:50,219
(men laughing)

1238
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:53,969
- Darlin', would you mind if I spoke

1239
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:57,149
to the children myself
just a moment, please?

1240
01:03:57,150 --> 01:03:58,150
Thank you.

1241
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:04,543
Come on now, children.

1242
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:08,714
Old Jeremiah is just a silly mountain man.

1243
01:04:08,715 --> 01:04:11,731
(dramatic music)

1244
01:04:11,732 --> 01:04:15,393
- Well, if it in the rugged mountain man.

1245
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:20,689
- We caught your ill-behaved
little friends here, Jeremiah.

1246
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,529
I believe there is a
law against contributing

1247
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:24,359
to the delinquency of minors.

1248
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,059
- What are you up to, Burt?

1249
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:29,169
- Now, Jeremiah, you know
that better than anybody.

1250
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:31,519
And everything's gonna work out just fine.

1251
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,919
Best thing you can do is set yourself up

1252
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,999
to make a little money,
just like everybody else.

1253
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,209
- You try and destroy these mountains,

1254
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:41,469
the accidents around here are
gonna get a whole lot worse.

1255
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:42,993
- [All] Ooh.

1256
01:04:43,834 --> 01:04:45,094
- Oh, I'm scared.

1257
01:04:45,095 --> 01:04:50,095
- (throat clearing)
You must excuse my men.

1258
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:51,329
They don't seem to realize

1259
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:54,359
that in your own, albeit misguided way,

1260
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,549
you're trying to help the townspeople,

1261
01:04:56,550 --> 01:04:57,909
just like I am.

1262
01:04:57,910 --> 01:05:00,239
- And what about my people?

1263
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,839
- Well, we have contingency plans

1264
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,799
with alternate other possible-

1265
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,379
(Betty throat clearing)

1266
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:08,839
We're working on it.

1267
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,819
- Well, we intend to help you

1268
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:12,489
in any way that you need help.

1269
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:15,062
Uh, resettling, starting
new businesses in town.

1270
01:05:15,063 --> 01:05:17,839
- What we need is for you not to destroy

1271
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:21,189
our homes and the homes of the animals.

1272
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:22,598
- Well, we'll find you a new home.

1273
01:05:22,599 --> 01:05:24,379
There's a-
- That land is sacred

1274
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:25,609
to our people.

1275
01:05:25,610 --> 01:05:28,199
- What are you gonna
do, scalp us? (laughing)

1276
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:31,735
- Yeah, or do a war dance.

1277
01:05:31,736 --> 01:05:34,319
(men whooping)

1278
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:39,430
- Quiet, you lunatics!

1279
01:05:40,482 --> 01:05:41,649
- Sorry, boss.

1280
01:05:44,388 --> 01:05:46,599
- Jeremiah, I don't know what to tell you.

1281
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,959
The railroad is coming to town.

1282
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,859
- And the kids are going with me.

1283
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:54,069
- Ah, now, these children
have broken the law.

1284
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:55,759
They have trespassed.

1285
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,888
They have, have knowingly
sought to hurt my men.

1286
01:05:58,889 --> 01:06:01,889
(men muttering)

1287
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:04,090
And we have no parents
to turn them over to.

1288
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:07,369
- So you thought you'd just kidnap them?

1289
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:08,220
(serious music)

1290
01:06:08,221 --> 01:06:10,249
- Well, well, I wouldn't
say we kidnapped them.

1291
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:11,465
- [Jones] Pie.

1292
01:06:11,466 --> 01:06:13,279
- We more like borrowed them

1293
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,376
long enough to ascertain
who their parents were,

1294
01:06:15,377 --> 01:06:16,374
and where they-

1295
01:06:16,375 --> 01:06:19,041
(Jones screams)

1296
01:06:20,179 --> 01:06:22,679
(men yelling)

1297
01:06:40,914 --> 01:06:42,581
Shut up, you idiots!

1298
01:06:44,837 --> 01:06:45,837
- Ants.

1299
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:50,069
- Mr. Jeremiah, we will
entrust these children

1300
01:06:50,070 --> 01:06:51,070
into your protection.

1301
01:06:51,071 --> 01:06:54,739
We were just trying to take care

1302
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:57,883
of our interests and
look after their safety.

1303
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:03,289
- Something stinks around
here, and I don't like it.

1304
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:05,929
- Jeremiah, you make sure that you find

1305
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:08,129
those kids' parents by tomorrow,

1306
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:09,106
or else I'll see to it

1307
01:07:09,107 --> 01:07:10,999
that they're sent to an orphanage.

1308
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,068
- Come on, kids, you're going with me.

1309
01:07:13,069 --> 01:07:15,486
(grim music)

1310
01:07:35,744 --> 01:07:38,564
- What's gonna happen, Jeremiah?

1311
01:07:38,565 --> 01:07:41,399
- Ooh, I hope nothing does, honey,

1312
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,843
but people do crazy things
when they chase money.

1313
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:48,349
Dylan, you about ready?

1314
01:07:48,350 --> 01:07:49,450
- [Dylan] In a minute.

1315
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:54,519
- You find a way home we
don't know about, Dylan?

1316
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,866
- Not yet, but I'm workin' on it.

1317
01:07:56,867 --> 01:07:57,999
- Now look, tiger, I don't know how

1318
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,189
all those gadgets work,

1319
01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:02,649
but tomorrow's gonna
be a real serious day.

1320
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:03,819
I think maybe it'd just be best

1321
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:06,829
we leave 'em behind so
they don't slow us up.

1322
01:08:06,830 --> 01:08:09,149
- No, I gotta take 'em, Jeremiah.

1323
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:10,209
They'll help us.

1324
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:11,043
You'll see.

1325
01:08:11,044 --> 01:08:13,689
- Well, all right, but
let's get a move on.

1326
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:16,343
It'd be best we weren't here
if they come looking for us.

1327
01:08:17,241 --> 01:08:18,741
Come on, let's go.

1328
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:36,940
Thank you.

1329
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:40,049
- My men have tracked them closely

1330
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:42,569
and know where most of
the dynamite is hidden.

1331
01:08:42,570 --> 01:08:45,359
But surely not all of it.

1332
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:47,989
- I don't know, Chief, we're
just gonna have to tie 'em up,

1333
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:50,340
get rid of 'em, so they
can't blow up anything.

1334
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:54,079
- Hmm, and so tomorrow we may be in jail?

1335
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,999
- Who's going to jail?

1336
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,229
- You two are spending
too much time up here.

1337
01:08:58,230 --> 01:09:00,479
I can't even hear you guys
sneak up on me anymore.

1338
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:02,603
- Maybe we can use the kids to help us.

1339
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:11,635
- Where'd you get this?

1340
01:09:11,636 --> 01:09:12,469
(curious music)

1341
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:13,923
- I found it outside of boss man's.

1342
01:09:15,370 --> 01:09:18,299
Isn't it pretty?

1343
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:19,603
It was in an old bucket.

1344
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:24,940
- I think you're right, Jeremiah.

1345
01:09:26,949 --> 01:09:28,899
- But there's only one way to find out.

1346
01:09:35,401 --> 01:09:38,495
(gun fires)

1347
01:09:38,496 --> 01:09:41,310
(horse whinnies)

1348
01:09:41,311 --> 01:09:42,311
- Hey, look.

1349
01:09:45,909 --> 01:09:48,409
(tense music)

1350
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,649
- Tukayoo, take these fake
gold rocks to the marshal.

1351
01:09:57,650 --> 01:09:59,220
This time he'll have to help us.

1352
01:09:59,221 --> 01:10:01,971
(exciting music)

1353
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:07,703
- Ya, ya, ya!

1354
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:10,393
(horse whinnying)

1355
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:12,165
- Let's go.

1356
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:13,655
That Injun's got one of
them fake gold rocks.

1357
01:10:13,656 --> 01:10:15,239
- Oh, no.
- Come on.

1358
01:10:21,458 --> 01:10:23,291
- [Roscoe] Ya, ha, ha!

1359
01:10:24,746 --> 01:10:26,579
- [Bailey] Ya! Ya! Ya!

1360
01:10:27,699 --> 01:10:28,949
- [Tukayoo] Ya!

1361
01:10:33,502 --> 01:10:34,335
Ya!

1362
01:10:34,336 --> 01:10:37,085
(exciting music)

1363
01:10:42,267 --> 01:10:43,267
Ya!

1364
01:10:49,915 --> 01:10:51,094
(horse whinnying)

1365
01:10:51,095 --> 01:10:53,140
Ya, ha, ha, ha!

1366
01:10:53,141 --> 01:10:54,391
Ya, ya, ya, ya!

1367
01:11:23,453 --> 01:11:26,703
- Well, I think we can make this, guys.

1368
01:11:27,663 --> 01:11:30,379
- Short cut.
- Short cut.

1369
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:31,713
- [Tukayoo] Ya!

1370
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:37,192
- [Roscoe] There he is.

1371
01:11:37,193 --> 01:11:38,359
Let's get him.

1372
01:11:39,934 --> 01:11:40,934
- Yee-ha!

1373
01:11:43,131 --> 01:11:44,324
Roscoe, Jones!

1374
01:11:44,325 --> 01:11:46,648
Wait up for me, I'm comin'!

1375
01:11:46,649 --> 01:11:48,929
(Bailey yells)

1376
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:49,763
- He-ya!

1377
01:11:49,763 --> 01:11:50,763
Ya!

1378
01:11:54,026 --> 01:11:55,096
- Come on, you big oaf.

1379
01:11:55,097 --> 01:11:56,324
We got to get to head off that Injun.

1380
01:11:56,325 --> 01:11:57,158
Come on, boy.

1381
01:11:57,159 --> 01:11:59,338
(men arguing)

1382
01:11:59,339 --> 01:12:00,339
Ha! Ha!

1383
01:12:03,749 --> 01:12:04,655
- He-ya!

1384
01:12:04,656 --> 01:12:06,089
He-ya!

1385
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:07,090
He-ya!

1386
01:12:12,803 --> 01:12:15,203
- [Roscoe] W-Well, I still
think we can make it.

1387
01:12:16,713 --> 01:12:17,796
- Ooh, uh uh.

1388
01:12:19,898 --> 01:12:22,648
(exciting music)

1389
01:12:38,659 --> 01:12:40,742
- [Tukayoo] He-ya! He-ya!

1390
01:13:00,378 --> 01:13:04,673
- [Jones] (laughing) Yeah, this ought

1391
01:13:04,674 --> 01:13:06,757
to shake 'em up a little.

1392
01:13:15,536 --> 01:13:18,453
(Indians chanting)

1393
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:22,709
- Well, the mining
company was empty, Chief,

1394
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:23,789
when I got there.

1395
01:13:23,790 --> 01:13:24,990
There was nobody around.

1396
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:28,999
We can only hope that the
mayor didn't go to Portland

1397
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,739
for that big meeting.

1398
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:32,499
- Who else can stop him?

1399
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:33,949
- We can only pray

1400
01:13:33,950 --> 01:13:37,203
that Tukayoo can bring
the marshal in time.

1401
01:13:38,110 --> 01:13:40,810
- Too bad you guys haven't
invented the telephone yet.

1402
01:13:44,715 --> 01:13:46,079
(Roscoe laughing)

1403
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,080
- [Jones] Whoa!

1404
01:13:47,758 --> 01:13:50,258
(men yelling)

1405
01:13:55,239 --> 01:13:56,239
- Where you?

1406
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:58,993
Where have you been?

1407
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,919
- I just rigged a big one
over at old Jeremiah's place.

1408
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:05,089
Teach him a lesson.

1409
01:14:05,090 --> 01:14:06,090
- [Bailey] You what?

1410
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:13,239
- Relax, it was just a little one.

1411
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,907
(both laughing)

1412
01:14:18,285 --> 01:14:19,699
- [Bailey] Well, that's awful dangerous.

1413
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:21,839
Nobody's supposed to get hurt, you know.

1414
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:25,359
- No one's gonna get hurt, I told ya.

1415
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,269
Just gonna teach him a little lesson.

1416
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:29,836
You know, hit him close to home.

1417
01:14:29,837 --> 01:14:32,780
(both laughing)

1418
01:14:32,781 --> 01:14:35,719
- Yeah, that ought to
send old Jeremiah away.

1419
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:38,491
We don't need any more of his problems.

1420
01:14:38,492 --> 01:14:41,159
(air whooshing)

1421
01:14:42,166 --> 01:14:44,999
(concerned music)

1422
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:52,759
- Dylan, Nichole, can you hear me?

1423
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:53,760
Over.

1424
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,033
- Megan!
- Here, she's in the cave.

1425
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:04,130
(air whooshing)

1426
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,559
- This telephone, you can talk into it

1427
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:09,289
and people can hear you
anywhere in the world?

1428
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:12,209
- Well, the furthest I've
called is my grandma in Florida.

1429
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:14,369
- What about the people?

1430
01:15:14,370 --> 01:15:16,559
- They're basically like everybody here,

1431
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,149
but they have more modern stuff.

1432
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:20,533
- Do they still fight?

1433
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:24,509
- CNN shows wars all over the world.

1434
01:15:24,510 --> 01:15:26,579
It seems like there's a lot of them.

1435
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:28,919
- You mean you can watch people fight?

1436
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:30,639
- Yeah, on a TV.

1437
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:34,099
It's a little box with
moving pictures inside.

1438
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:36,743
- What about the Indian and the white man?

1439
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:40,149
- Well, they don't really fight anymore,

1440
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:42,529
but people still say mean things

1441
01:15:42,530 --> 01:15:44,563
about other people who are different.

1442
01:15:45,530 --> 01:15:48,159
And they argue about
stuff like cutting down

1443
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,099
all the trees in the world.

1444
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:51,609
Like my mom and dad.

1445
01:15:51,610 --> 01:15:53,673
My dad works for the state of Oregon.

1446
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:57,209
He's gonna hire a bunch
of guys to come cut down

1447
01:15:57,210 --> 01:15:59,439
all the trees on the mountain

1448
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:03,309
and build condos and
stores and golf courses

1449
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:04,839
and stuff like that.

1450
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,193
- I miss Mom and Dad.

1451
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:09,513
- It is almost sunup.

1452
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:12,753
We will pray for this day.

1453
01:16:14,301 --> 01:16:18,301
(speaking in foreign language)

1454
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,960
You two go with Oyakuee.

1455
01:16:28,242 --> 01:16:31,159
(Indians chanting)

1456
01:16:38,574 --> 01:16:41,157
(gentle music)

1457
01:16:50,490 --> 01:16:52,863
- Okay, make sure everything works.

1458
01:16:56,540 --> 01:16:58,071
Roadster.

1459
01:16:58,072 --> 01:16:59,866
(siren wailing)

1460
01:16:59,867 --> 01:17:00,850
Check.

1461
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:01,850
- Flashlight.

1462
01:17:02,770 --> 01:17:03,770
- Come on.

1463
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,299
- Walkie-talkie.
- Check.

1464
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:08,300
- Check.

1465
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:10,593
- Can't test these.

1466
01:17:11,592 --> 01:17:13,979
- [Megan] Dylan, Nicole, over.

1467
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:15,357
- Quick talk to 'em.

1468
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:17,399
- Megan?

1469
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,119
- [Megan] Dylan, Nichole, can you hear me?

1470
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,120
Over.

1471
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:23,828
- Megan, come out of here.

1472
01:17:23,829 --> 01:17:24,662
- Shh.

1473
01:17:24,662 --> 01:17:25,600
I found Nicole.

1474
01:17:25,601 --> 01:17:26,989
- You heard something?

1475
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:28,954
- Nichole, sweetie, is that you?

1476
01:17:28,955 --> 01:17:30,659
Is that you?

1477
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:33,379
Honey, quickly, where are you?

1478
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:34,739
- We're in an Indian village,

1479
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:36,632
but we went through the cave.

1480
01:17:36,633 --> 01:17:38,716
We went through the cave.

1481
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,439
- Dylan?

1482
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:46,895
Dylan, if you can hear
us, we're in the cave.

1483
01:17:46,896 --> 01:17:49,789
- No, get out of the cave!

1484
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:51,927
- Mom, Dad?
- Dylan?

1485
01:17:53,356 --> 01:17:55,183
Dylan.
- Mom?

1486
01:17:55,184 --> 01:17:56,834
- Dylan.
- Dad.

1487
01:17:56,835 --> 01:17:57,792
- Dylan?

1488
01:17:57,793 --> 01:17:59,023
(air whooshing)

1489
01:17:59,024 --> 01:18:01,883
- [Dylan] Get out of the cave!

1490
01:18:01,884 --> 01:18:04,634
(exciting music)

1491
01:18:25,283 --> 01:18:27,209
- Marshal Jackson will come,

1492
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:28,460
but he's hours behind me.

1493
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,339
- Thanks, Tukayoo.

1494
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:35,529
There's no way we can
wait for the marshal.

1495
01:18:35,530 --> 01:18:36,680
There's too much to do.

1496
01:18:37,711 --> 01:18:41,628
(speaking in foreign language)

1497
01:18:44,057 --> 01:18:46,129
I want the women, I want
the children to stay here.

1498
01:18:46,130 --> 01:18:48,159
We'll take turns going into the tepees

1499
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,839
if we have to pack our things and leave.

1500
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:52,719
Tukayoo, I want you to take your men.

1501
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:56,239
I want you to find
Roscoe, Bailey, and Jones.

1502
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:57,073
I want you to tie 'em up.

1503
01:18:57,074 --> 01:19:00,179
I want you to put 'em somewhere
where nobody can find 'em.

1504
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:02,429
The second anybody finds
a bundle of dynamite,

1505
01:19:02,430 --> 01:19:04,079
throw it in the lake,
throw it in the river,

1506
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,269
do whatever you can.

1507
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:07,879
Make sure these guys can't
find it and rewire it.

1508
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:09,119
All I can say is we gotta go.

1509
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:09,953
We got a lot to do,

1510
01:19:09,954 --> 01:19:11,339
and I wish you the best of luck.

1511
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:13,219
I know we can get 'em.

1512
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:14,560
(gentle music)

1513
01:19:14,561 --> 01:19:15,493
(speaking in foreign language)

1514
01:19:15,494 --> 01:19:16,669
Dylan, Nicole, come here.

1515
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:19,309
- [Dylan] Jeremiah,
what about our parents?

1516
01:19:19,310 --> 01:19:21,659
- I know, Dylan, I know.

1517
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:23,709
- But our parents are still in the cave.

1518
01:19:23,710 --> 01:19:25,115
We gotta get 'em out.

1519
01:19:25,116 --> 01:19:25,949
- We'll get 'em out of the cave,

1520
01:19:25,950 --> 01:19:28,303
but first I gotta find
that detonation box.

1521
01:19:43,392 --> 01:19:45,666
(men snoring)

1522
01:19:45,667 --> 01:19:47,067
- What in tarnation?

1523
01:19:47,068 --> 01:19:47,901
(door slams)

1524
01:19:47,902 --> 01:19:49,164
(men grunting and groaning)

1525
01:19:49,165 --> 01:19:49,998
- [Bailey] Mommy, Mommy.

1526
01:19:49,999 --> 01:19:51,329
- Get out of bed!

1527
01:19:51,330 --> 01:19:53,211
- Where you been, boss?
- I was just getttin' up.

1528
01:19:53,212 --> 01:19:55,462
- It's none of your
business where I've been.

1529
01:19:56,330 --> 01:19:57,942
You just better be able to tell me

1530
01:19:57,943 --> 01:20:00,150
that that mountain is ready to blow!

1531
01:20:01,089 --> 01:20:02,789
(Roscoe yawning)

1532
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:06,199
- Oh, we, we ran out of wire, boss.

1533
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,619
- You ran out of wire?

1534
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:10,359
There's enough wire in the wagon

1535
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:12,550
to reach from here to Portland!

1536
01:20:12,551 --> 01:20:15,599
- Y-y-y-you had the wagon, boss.

1537
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,713
- I had the wagon?

1538
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:19,680
I had the wagon.

1539
01:20:20,932 --> 01:20:21,765
(Bailey muttering)

1540
01:20:21,765 --> 01:20:22,598
- Wake up, wake up!

1541
01:20:22,598 --> 01:20:23,431
Yeah, boss is right.

1542
01:20:23,431 --> 01:20:24,264
We gotta hurry.

1543
01:20:24,264 --> 01:20:25,097
We gotta hurry.

1544
01:20:25,097 --> 01:20:25,958
Don't worry, boss.

1545
01:20:25,959 --> 01:20:27,729
All I gotta do is a get a couple of wires,

1546
01:20:27,730 --> 01:20:28,997
hook it up to a main.

1547
01:20:30,730 --> 01:20:32,009
A main detonation wire

1548
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:32,843
Put it into a-

1549
01:20:32,844 --> 01:20:37,307
- I want you men outside,
ready to go in five minutes.

1550
01:20:38,190 --> 01:20:40,729
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, five.
- Five, five.

1551
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:43,603
- Bone-headed, chicken scratchin',

1552
01:20:43,604 --> 01:20:46,933
gold frickin, gum flappin', flea-bitten.

1553
01:20:49,114 --> 01:20:50,729
(funny music)

1554
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:53,692
(men muttering)

1555
01:20:53,693 --> 01:20:56,109
- [Jones] Oh, dagnabbit,
that bed was itchy

1556
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:56,943
as all get out.

1557
01:20:56,944 --> 01:20:58,126
- I was itchin' all night.
- Boneheads.

1558
01:20:58,127 --> 01:20:59,127
Get over here!

1559
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:02,770
Now, show me where else you have to wire.

1560
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,517
- Right there and, uh.

1561
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:08,744
Ah!

1562
01:21:08,745 --> 01:21:09,803
Oh, I'm sorry, boss.

1563
01:21:10,790 --> 01:21:12,009
Right there.

1564
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:13,103
- Then b-b-boom.

1565
01:21:15,850 --> 01:21:18,433
(men laughing)

1566
01:21:20,372 --> 01:21:22,549
- Well, get going!

1567
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:23,550
Ow.

1568
01:21:24,279 --> 01:21:25,123
Ooh!

1569
01:21:25,124 --> 01:21:27,623
(funny music)

1570
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,409
I want you men to blow the mountain.

1571
01:21:44,410 --> 01:21:45,879
- [Man] Yeah.

1572
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:48,289
- Find a safe place.
- Yeah.

1573
01:21:48,290 --> 01:21:50,090
- Or don't worry about a safe place,

1574
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:53,073
just blow the mountain.

1575
01:21:54,519 --> 01:21:55,950
Blow the mountain!

1576
01:21:55,951 --> 01:21:58,701
(exciting music)

1577
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:10,075
- What are you waitin' for?

1578
01:22:10,076 --> 01:22:10,909
- I'll do it.

1579
01:22:10,909 --> 01:22:11,900
- Wait, wait.

1580
01:22:11,901 --> 01:22:14,369
Don't you think boss man want to see this?

1581
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:17,223
- [Jones] He said to blow it right now.

1582
01:22:19,113 --> 01:22:19,946
- Oh now, wait a minute.

1583
01:22:19,946 --> 01:22:20,779
Let me think about it.

1584
01:22:20,779 --> 01:22:21,779
He, uh.

1585
01:22:24,130 --> 01:22:27,426
Yeah, I think he did.
- Okay.

1586
01:22:27,427 --> 01:22:28,427
One.

1587
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,063
And two.

1588
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:34,253
And-

1589
01:22:34,253 --> 01:22:35,253
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

1590
01:22:36,270 --> 01:22:37,729
What if he's near the dynamite?

1591
01:22:37,730 --> 01:22:39,527
- He ain't that stupid.

1592
01:22:39,528 --> 01:22:40,989
- Yeah.

1593
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:42,723
We better find him.
- Yeah.

1594
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,593
- Hey, psst, this way!

1595
01:22:48,084 --> 01:22:51,476
(cheerful music)

1596
01:22:51,477 --> 01:22:52,420
(Jack grunting)

1597
01:22:52,421 --> 01:22:54,587
- [Nicole] Good job, Jack.

1598
01:23:07,171 --> 01:23:10,171
(toy siren wailing)

1599
01:23:14,746 --> 01:23:17,829
(squirrel squeaking)

1600
01:23:19,047 --> 01:23:21,880
(horse whinnying)

1601
01:23:31,307 --> 01:23:33,439
- Oh, the map said the fork in the road

1602
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:34,469
not the tree in the road.

1603
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:36,813
Shut up! (muttering)

1604
01:23:40,086 --> 01:23:41,506
Oh, keep it right here.

1605
01:23:41,507 --> 01:23:42,340
Yeah.

1606
01:23:42,341 --> 01:23:43,387
Yeah, that's it.

1607
01:23:43,388 --> 01:23:44,388
There now.

1608
01:23:45,329 --> 01:23:46,828
That's more like it.

1609
01:23:46,829 --> 01:23:48,246
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1610
01:23:52,131 --> 01:23:52,964
Boss man!

1611
01:23:52,965 --> 01:23:54,189
Boss man, I did it.

1612
01:23:54,190 --> 01:23:56,009
I put the plunger right there
in the fork in the road.

1613
01:23:56,010 --> 01:23:57,171
- Hey, boss!
- It's sittin' pretty

1614
01:23:57,172 --> 01:23:59,091
in the fork in the road.
- Boss, hey, boss!

1615
01:23:59,092 --> 01:23:59,925
- [Roscoe] Get out of my way.

1616
01:23:59,926 --> 01:24:01,289
Boss man, it's right there.

1617
01:24:01,290 --> 01:24:02,889
Buffalo breath, get in here.

1618
01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:04,490
Hey, boss man, it's right, boss.

1619
01:24:08,682 --> 01:24:09,515
- I don't believe it.

1620
01:24:09,515 --> 01:24:10,515
We came...

1621
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:16,370
Well, what are we gonna do now?

1622
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:20,167
- Hey, if, if...

1623
01:24:28,462 --> 01:24:29,905
- I got it!

1624
01:24:29,906 --> 01:24:30,906
I got it!

1625
01:24:31,628 --> 01:24:33,686
(man yelling)

1626
01:24:33,687 --> 01:24:34,854
- [All] Injun!

1627
01:24:39,191 --> 01:24:40,850
(all yelling)

1628
01:24:40,851 --> 01:24:43,684
(Indians yelling)

1629
01:24:44,774 --> 01:24:47,524
(dramatic music)

1630
01:24:53,619 --> 01:24:55,458
- [Nicole] Dylan!

1631
01:24:55,459 --> 01:24:56,459
Dylan?

1632
01:24:57,195 --> 01:24:59,778
(gentle music)

1633
01:25:09,143 --> 01:25:11,893
- Why do I have to do everything?

1634
01:25:12,997 --> 01:25:14,748
I'll blow it myself.

1635
01:25:14,749 --> 01:25:17,582
(dangerous music)

1636
01:25:19,336 --> 01:25:20,414
(Nicole gasps)

1637
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:21,415
You.

1638
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:25,494
- Uh!
- Wait.

1639
01:25:27,259 --> 01:25:28,782
(Dylan yells)

1640
01:25:28,783 --> 01:25:29,674
Get off me.

1641
01:25:29,674 --> 01:25:30,507
(Dylan grunting)

1642
01:25:30,508 --> 01:25:32,565
- [Nicole] Get him, Dylan.

1643
01:25:32,566 --> 01:25:34,399
- [Burt] Let go of me.

1644
01:25:36,063 --> 01:25:37,169
- [Nicole] Get him, Jeremiah.

1645
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:38,317
- [Dylan] Get him, Jeremiah.

1646
01:25:38,318 --> 01:25:39,579
Get him!

1647
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:41,649
- [Burt] Oh, my neck.

1648
01:25:41,650 --> 01:25:44,342
- So where do you think
you're goin' mister, huh?

1649
01:25:44,343 --> 01:25:46,161
- [Burt] I can't breathe.

1650
01:25:46,162 --> 01:25:48,065
Let go of me!

1651
01:25:48,066 --> 01:25:50,899
(dangerous music)

1652
01:25:53,589 --> 01:25:54,659
Betty.

1653
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:56,573
- Such a gallant effort by you both.

1654
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:01,803
- Like I said, railroad's comin' to town.

1655
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:05,992
- Don't do it, ma'am.

1656
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:08,320
I know everything, ma'am.

1657
01:26:11,382 --> 01:26:12,581
I said don't do it.

1658
01:26:12,582 --> 01:26:13,901
- Don't do it.

1659
01:26:13,902 --> 01:26:14,902
No!

1660
01:26:17,049 --> 01:26:20,049
(suspenseful music)

1661
01:26:24,578 --> 01:26:27,578
(explosion booming)

1662
01:26:30,383 --> 01:26:32,193
Isn't that your place, Burt?

1663
01:26:47,148 --> 01:26:47,981
- Nah!

1664
01:26:47,981 --> 01:26:48,981
- Lookin' for these?

1665
01:26:51,390 --> 01:26:55,848
- Ugh! (laughing)

1666
01:26:55,849 --> 01:26:57,281
(Jeremiah laughing)

1667
01:26:57,282 --> 01:26:59,865
(lively music)

1668
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:01,969
- That's funny.

1669
01:27:09,551 --> 01:27:11,086
- [Both] The cave!

1670
01:27:11,087 --> 01:27:11,954
(woman screams)

1671
01:27:11,955 --> 01:27:13,311
(dramatic music)

1672
01:27:13,312 --> 01:27:16,645
- [Bill] Right now, move it, move, move.

1673
01:27:19,298 --> 01:27:22,424
- [Nicole] Hurry up, Jeremiah.

1674
01:27:22,425 --> 01:27:25,175
(wondrous music)

1675
01:27:27,173 --> 01:27:29,064
- [Bill] Dylan! Nicole!

1676
01:27:29,065 --> 01:27:30,639
- [Dylan And Nicole] Mom! Dad!

1677
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:31,640
Megan!

1678
01:27:39,121 --> 01:27:41,704
(joyful music)

1679
01:27:58,882 --> 01:27:59,841
- [Bill] Thank you.

1680
01:27:59,842 --> 01:28:01,582
- No, it was my pleasure.

1681
01:28:01,583 --> 01:28:02,583
Thank you.

1682
01:28:06,741 --> 01:28:09,991
(townspeople shouting)

1683
01:28:11,310 --> 01:28:13,975
- Kill 'em.
- Hang 'em.

1684
01:28:13,976 --> 01:28:16,309
(gun fires)

1685
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:19,140
- Thank you, folks.

1686
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:22,529
Now, I do appreciate you coming out

1687
01:28:22,530 --> 01:28:26,029
to discuss politely the events
of the last day together.

1688
01:28:26,030 --> 01:28:27,710
And I do believe at this time

1689
01:28:28,690 --> 01:28:30,509
the honorable mayor has a few things

1690
01:28:30,510 --> 01:28:31,910
he'd like to share with you.

1691
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:34,747
Mr. Mayor.

1692
01:28:34,748 --> 01:28:36,414
- [Townspeople] Boo!

1693
01:28:40,081 --> 01:28:41,087
String him up!
- Hang him!

1694
01:28:41,088 --> 01:28:44,769
- Friends, neighbors, you all know me.

1695
01:28:44,770 --> 01:28:47,663
I'm not a dishonest man by nature.

1696
01:28:47,664 --> 01:28:49,730
(men groaning)

1697
01:28:49,731 --> 01:28:50,938
- [Dylan] Look. (laughing)

1698
01:28:50,939 --> 01:28:53,439
(funny music)

1699
01:28:55,141 --> 01:28:57,974
(people laughing)

1700
01:29:00,703 --> 01:29:01,786
- [Men] Whoa!

1701
01:29:07,490 --> 01:29:12,490
- But in conclusion, I would
just like to say that I am,

1702
01:29:12,570 --> 01:29:16,663
I am deeply, deeply, sorry.

1703
01:29:16,664 --> 01:29:19,581
(melancholy music)

1704
01:29:20,630 --> 01:29:21,630
- Burt.

1705
01:29:24,350 --> 01:29:26,479
- Although I was not personally aware

1706
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:30,737
of the so-called gold scam, my men

1707
01:29:30,738 --> 01:29:33,323
(men struggling)
and I were

1708
01:29:33,324 --> 01:29:34,889
indirectly involved,

1709
01:29:34,890 --> 01:29:39,890
and I wish to apologize for
our irresponsible actions

1710
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:44,889
as well as the actions of Miss Betty.

1711
01:29:44,890 --> 01:29:48,119
In an attempt to repay
those to whom we were

1712
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:50,683
so greedily disrespectful,

1713
01:29:51,670 --> 01:29:53,839
I'm hereby relinquishing my rights

1714
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,373
to develop the mountain area.

1715
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:58,859
And I am signing over the leasehold

1716
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:00,099
to the Indian community

1717
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:04,533
for the remaining 125
years left on the term.

1718
01:30:06,806 --> 01:30:08,319
- [Man] Here here here!

1719
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:12,599
- I'd like very much to
help develop this town,

1720
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:17,600
but, well, maybe Jeremiah
and I could do it together?

1721
01:30:24,430 --> 01:30:25,894
- [Man From Town] That a boy, Jeremiah.

1722
01:30:25,895 --> 01:30:28,728
(people clapping)

1723
01:30:33,426 --> 01:30:34,843
- Come on, ma'am.

1724
01:30:43,573 --> 01:30:45,502
(people talking)

1725
01:30:45,503 --> 01:30:48,086
(gentle music)

1726
01:30:54,445 --> 01:30:56,779
- Thank you so much for
taking care of our children.

1727
01:30:56,780 --> 01:30:58,279
We owe you all we have.

1728
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:00,003
- It's my pleasure.

1729
01:31:00,004 --> 01:31:02,704
It seems that they helped
me as much as I helped them.

1730
01:31:04,449 --> 01:31:07,608
I don't think we could have
saved the mountain without 'em.

1731
01:31:07,609 --> 01:31:09,479
I think there were the
answer to our prayers,

1732
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:10,480
that's for sure.

1733
01:31:11,785 --> 01:31:14,285
And I think the kids were
the secret to that cave.

1734
01:31:18,530 --> 01:31:21,939
- This is one mountain that
should remain untouched.

1735
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:22,940
Forever.

1736
01:31:25,263 --> 01:31:28,180
(Indians cheering)

1737
01:31:29,943 --> 01:31:31,518
(drums beating)

1738
01:31:31,519 --> 01:31:34,436
(Indians chanting)

1739
01:31:45,866 --> 01:31:48,318
(air whooshing)

1740
01:31:48,319 --> 01:31:49,573
- We made it.

1741
01:31:49,574 --> 01:31:50,516
We're back.

1742
01:31:50,517 --> 01:31:53,266
(peaceful music)

1743
01:31:58,771 --> 01:32:00,654
- [Captain] Megan.

1744
01:32:00,655 --> 01:32:02,480
Where have you guys been?

1745
01:32:02,481 --> 01:32:03,617
- [Mom] Oh, boy.

1746
01:32:03,618 --> 01:32:04,785
- Uh, Captain.

1747
01:32:05,695 --> 01:32:06,678
- Good to see you.

1748
01:32:06,679 --> 01:32:08,837
- You have no idea.
- Where did you find them?

1749
01:32:08,838 --> 01:32:12,235
- You would not believe
the stuff we saw, Captain.

1750
01:32:12,236 --> 01:32:13,219
There were, there were,

1751
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:14,306
there were Indians.
- Looked all over

1752
01:32:14,307 --> 01:32:15,419
these mountains for you people.

1753
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:17,670
- [Bill] There were tepees.

1754
01:32:18,507 --> 01:32:21,257
(peaceful music)

1755
01:32:45,511 --> 01:32:48,511
(adventurous music)
