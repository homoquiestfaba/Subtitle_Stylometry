00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:17,282
<i>Chuckie sol, a made man</i>

3
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:18,617

4
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:21,120

5
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:23,322
<i>Suspicion is high that</i>

6
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:24,790
<i>of the recent turf war</i>

7
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:27,359
<i>raging between the mob</i>

8

<i>composed of high-tech criminals</i>

9
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:30,896
<i>known to have crossed</i>
<i>paths with Batman.</i>

10
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,966
I don't know about any
weapon shipment, tusk.

11
00:00:33,968 --> 00:00:36,502
Mask don't tell us... ahhh!

12
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:38,704
You could do better
than that, Chuckie.

13
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:40,205
We ain't got all night.

14
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:49,048
Old electrocutioner here gets
mighty ticked when someone lies.

15
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:53,085
When is that
weapons shipment due?

16
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,671
Wait...

17
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:15,007
Batman doesn't use guns.

18
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:16,475
Batman doesn't.

19
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:18,510
But I do.

20
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,524
I'm just the accountant.

21
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:33,592
Shut it!

22
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,450
That's no way to treat a lady.

23
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:16,235
I could've handled
these c-listers on my own.

24
00:02:16,237 --> 00:02:18,770
Dressing like a bat
doesn't make you a hero.

25
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,472
It just makes you a target.

26
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,877
And using a gun makes
you just like them.

27
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,917
I want you out of here.

28
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,185
Now!

29
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,250
Whoa!

30
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,210
Down!

31
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:43,422
This wasn't a break-in.
Was it, firefly?

32
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:45,390
Of course not.

33
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,226
They're working
for someone new.

34
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:48,493
Who?

35
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,832
This is truly an honor, Batman.

36
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,835
I've waited so very long
for this moment.

37
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,938
Though the circumstances
are less than ideal.

38
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,341
Do I know you?

39
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:04,009
Intimately...

40
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:05,410
And not at all.

41
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,651
And you rag on me
for stealing your look.

42
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,377
Onyx, now.

43
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,847
Rest well, Batman.

44
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:00,959
<i>It's not like he punches</i>
<i>a time clock,</i>

45
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:03,028
<i>but I can assure you that</i>
<i>the Gotham police force</i>

46
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,465
<i>is more than capable of</i>
<i>keeping this city safe.</i>

47
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:08,767
<i>Even without a masked hero</i>
<i>to back us up.</i>

48
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,072
You're a bad liar, Gordon.

49
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:29,988
<i>So, are on your way?</i>

50
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,324
Yeah, babe.
You can't believe the traffic.

51
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,326
It's blockbuster!

52
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,703
<i>Can't wait to see you.</i>

53
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:46,872
<i>It's been weeks, dick.</i>

54
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:49,608
<i>I've almost forgotten</i>
<i>what you feel like.</i>

55
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,909
I'll remind...

56
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,347
<i>It's...</i>

57
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:56,915
What's all that noise?

58
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,049
Construction.

59
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,154
Hold on,
I think I see an opening.

60
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,125
Huh?

61
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,730
Yup. All clear, Kori.

62
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:13,365
I'll be at the tower in fi...

63
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:18,403
Babe, you have no idea
how sorry I am, but...

64
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,538
<i>But, what about our...</i>

65
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,373
Got a family emergency.

66
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,308
Nightwing out.

67
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,544
Your timing really sucks,
Alfred.

68
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:42,060
Well, your trip to the rainforest
seems ill-timed, Mr. Wayne.

69
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,062
With the world tech summit
coming up...

70
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:46,431
<i>It's not for another week,</i>
<i>Ms. bannister.</i>

71
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:47,999
<i>We're down here</i>
<i>studying rare herbs</i>

72
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,435
<i>that could prove revolutionary</i>
<i>for medical research.</i>

73
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:54,239
<i>And earn millions for our</i>
<i>pharmaceutical interests.</i>

74
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:55,774
All well and good.

75
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:58,643
But why did you have
to lead the team?

76
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,178
<i>Because it's my company.</i>

77
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,781
<i>And I can do whatever</i>
<i>the bloody hell I want to.</i>

78
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:06,017
<i>You still have to answer
to this board, Mr. Wayne.</i>

79
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,085
<i>And frankly...</i>

80
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:08,653
I think we're done here.

81
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,089
If any of you have
further concerns,

82
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:12,624
bring them to Lucius.

83
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:15,827
He's more than capable of
handling things while I'm gone.

84
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,468
Oh, dear.

85
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,104
I'd watch those
"bloody hells," governor.

86
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,039
Don't want to be
giving yourself away.

87
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,341
Master dick.

88
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:32,944
It's bad manners to sneak up
on a person like that.

89
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,680
Sneaking up on people is kind of
what we do around here, Alfred.

90
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,550
That's a joke.

91
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,721
We are not amused.

92
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:45,190
I'm not exactly in
a festive mood either.

93
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,560
How long has he been gone?

94
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:50,896
Two weeks, one day,

95
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:52,564
15 hours.

96
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,799
Wouldn't be the first time.

97
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,835
But he's never
been gone this long

98
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:59,704
without notifying me
in some way.

99
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,574
Last night, the signal
was up for an hour.

100
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,075
Third time this week.

101
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,745
And if the police are
aware of his absence,

102
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:10,248
then you can be certain
the criminal class is as well.

103
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,653
There's already been a sharp
uptick in underworld activities.

104
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:17,188
If Batman doesn't
return soon...

105
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,490
I know.

106
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:20,258
All bloody hell's
gonna break loose.

107
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,963
Even when you've disappeared,
I can't get away from you.

108
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,001
Oh, Mr. fox.

109
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,870
I think it's way
past time we...

110
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:33,505
Apologies, Ms. bannister.

111
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:36,608
I have an important visitor
who simply can't wait.

112
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,248
Huh! That woman!

113
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,516
What's wrong, dad?

114
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:46,284
Bannister's been barking
at you for years.

115
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,753
You never let her
get under your skin.

116
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,256
Maybe I'm getting
too old for this.

117
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,025
Come on. Let's get some grub.

118
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:56,061
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to cancel, Luke.

119
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:58,530
Too much on my plate
right here.

120
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:02,934
Of course, if you'd finally accept Mr. Wayne's
offer, we could do lunch every day.

121
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,102
Dad...

122
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,037
With your background
in physics and math...

123
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,540
Dad... -You'd be an
extraordinary asset.

124
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:10,108
Dad!

125
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,678
I said no before I went into
the service and it's still no.

126
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,380
Why?

127
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,315
You're the one who told me
to follow my own path.

128
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,820
Yes.

129
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,289
But I never thought it would
take you to Afghanistan.

130
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,808
I thought your doctor
told you to give that up.

131
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,815
I've decided
to live dangerously.

132
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,617
Like my daughter.

133
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,452
As I recall,

134
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,821
I picked up the art of dangerous
living from you, colonel Kane.

135
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,089
How are you, dad?

136
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,592
I'm more concerned with
how you are, Kate.

137
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:02,260
I haven't seen you in weeks.

138
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:06,431
I was hoping you'd
met some nice girl.

139
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:10,402
I've been trying to find out something,
anything, about my mystery man.

140
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,103
And...

141
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,272
It's like
he doesn't even exist.

142
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:15,840
What about his friends?

143
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,610
Vanished without a trace.

144
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:20,845
I watched that place
blow apart, dad.

145
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,213
There was no way
he could've escaped.

146
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,983
And I keep wondering if
there was something...

147
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:27,619
Anything that I could've done.

148
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:29,621
Are you sure he's dead, Kate?

149
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:31,956
This is Batman
we're talking about.

150
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,892
No one could've survived that.

151
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,695
I need your help on this one.

152
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,802
Your mother always thought
you'd be an artist.

153
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:46,204
Elizabeth was the one
with the real talent.

154
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,415
<i>Katey. Are you okay?</i>

155
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,087
Kate?

156
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,422
Huh?

157
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:07,425
I'll see what my network can
dig up on your mystery man.

158
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:12,597
They keep hoping for
an answer, don't they?

159
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:13,865
Why don't you give them one.

160
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,133
Not my style.

161
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,913
It seems reports of his death
have been greatly...

162
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,084
Exaggerated.

163
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,455
Watch your back, Kate.

164
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,968
New guy thinks he can move in.

165
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,638
I'm gonna show those punks
who's top dog around here.

166
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,373
Gotham's my bitch.

167
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,809
Which makes you mine, mask.

168
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:59,778
You're supposed to be dead.

169
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,346
Let me fix that for you.

170
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:21,800
Damn it!

171
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:29,507
I bet 50 grand that you
were dead this time.

172
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,243
You lost.

173
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:35,079
Always bet on black.

174
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,128
Robin?

175
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,163
Somebody kill
this freaking kid!

176
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:06,077
Damian?

177
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,724
What?

178
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,492
I could've handled this alone.

179
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:57,662
If that's your best, Batman,
you're not gonna fool anyone,

180
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,664
Grayson.

181
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,400
Maybe you'd like a megaphone
to announce that?

182
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:14,012
There's no way you're gonna
pull this off without my help.

183
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:15,280
Modest as ever, I see.

184
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:17,181
I'm more Batman
than you'll ever be.

185
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:18,950
Just follow my lead.

186
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,854
We're being tailed.

187
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:54,018
You've been
tracking me all night.

188
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,921
I want to know why.

189
00:15:56,923 --> 00:16:00,825
First, tell me why you're running
around Gotham playing dress-up.

190
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,393
I'm guessing nightwing?

191
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,130
Hmm! Busted.

192
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,933
Actually, I think he's more than
capable of fooling most people.

193
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:12,603
And you're certainly not gonna
pass for Batman, short stack.

194
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:13,738
Who the hell are you?

195
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,473
Easy, Robin.

196
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,009
Tell me what you want and
why you've been following me.

197
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,744
I just had to make sure.

198
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:22,313
You see, I was there
the night Batman died.

199
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,586
<i>He threw me clear</i>
<i>and saved my life.</i>

200
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:32,156
But before I could get back
up here it blew apart.

201
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,027
And we're just supposed
to believe that?

202
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,628
Believe what you want.

203
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,863
I don't trust her.

204
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,665
Oh, but you did trust Talon.

205
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,768
Shut up.

206
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,771
Who was it? Who were tusk
and firefly working for?

207
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:48,473
I don't know.

208
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:51,442
But when I find out, I'll
drop a note in your lunchbox.

209
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:54,846
If you're serious about hunting them
down then we should work together.

210
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,314
Just because I wear this,

211
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:58,516
doesn't mean I'm a part
of your little cult.

212
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,258
You really have a way
with women, Grayson.

213
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,035
Do you think he's really dead?

214
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,203
I don't know.

215
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,805
You'd like it, wouldn't you...

216
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,340
If he never came back?

217
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,208
Then you get to keep that suit.

218
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:34,018
I've struggled for years to
get out of Bruce's shadow,

219
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,319
to build a life for myself

220
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:37,855
as far away from
his world as possible.

221
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:39,357
And the last thing I want

222
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,626
is to be wearing
this damn thing!

223
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:44,996
<i>Um...</i>

224
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:48,833
<i>I've finally managed to locate
master Bruce's files on Batwoman.</i>

225
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:50,368
How come I never heard of her?

226
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,670
<i>She's kept a rather</i>
<i>low profile.</i>

227
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,572
Not low enough for Batman,
I'll bet.

228
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,843
<i>Investigative report</i>
<i>on Batwoman,</i>

229
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:00,411
<i>aka Katherine Kane.</i>

230
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,246
Katey?

231
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,681
You know her?

232
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,783
<i>Her father is</i>
<i>colonel Jacob Kane.</i>

233
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,019
<i>Military intelligence.</i>

234
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:11,889
<i>On Katherine's 12th birthday, she and her
twin sister Elizabeth were abducted,</i>

235
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,958
<i>along with their mother,</i>
<i>Gabrielle,</i>

236
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,793
<i>and held for ransom.</i>

237
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:18,963
<i>Colonel Kane led a rescue
mission that saved Kate's life.</i>

238
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:23,201
<i>But in the attempt both Gabrielle
and Elizabeth were murdered.</i>

239
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:27,038
<i>She would follow in her father's
footsteps, enrolling at west point,</i>

240
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,906
<i>but ultimately expelled.</i>

241
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,942
<i>Something broke inside Kate.</i>

242
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:34,145
<i>Two years later, Katherine</i>
<i>emerged as Batwoman.</i>

243
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:35,546
<i>She's impressive,</i>

244
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:38,049
<i>but her methods make her</i>
<i>a danger to this city.</i>

245
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:39,417
<i>And to herself.</i>

246
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:40,785
<i>It's time for me to decide if.</i>

247
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,820
<i>I'm going to take her</i>
<i>under my wing...</i>

248
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,190
<i>Or take her down.</i>

249
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,761
Poor katey.

250
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:53,231
It always begins with death.
Doesn't it, Alfred?

251
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:56,400
<i>I'm as astonished as you are,</i>
<i>master dick.</i>

252
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:58,302
Anyone mind filling me in?

253
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,570
How do you know her?

254
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,305
I just do.

255
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,020
I had to dig very deep,
my dear,

256
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:19,957
reach out to contacts that
even I find somewhat unsavory.

257
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,259
But here he is,

258
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:23,094
your mystery man.

259
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,796
The heretic.
That's his accomplice.

260
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,098
Onyx.

261
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,366
Heretic?

262
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,034
What kind of name is that?

263
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,136
One that invokes disbelief.

264
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:34,205
His accomplishments
certainly do.

265
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:38,676
In the last 10 months, he has quietly
forged some dangerous alliances,

266
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,312
as well as become a Thorn
in the side of black mask.

267
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:45,283
He may have gathered half the criminals
in Gotham under his command.

268
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:46,851
But who is he?

269
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:49,220
All I know is, that he's left
a trail of empty vaults

270
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:51,722
and dead bodies
across this city.

271
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:54,158
And as your experience attests,

272
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,727
he seems to have
a fixation with Batman.

273
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,964
With all due respect, dad,
that doesn't help much.

274
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,332
I'm sorry.

275
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:03,467
I just need to figure
this out on my own.

276
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,871
I'll see you back at the house.

277
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,541
Don't worry, Kate.

278
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,410
I won't let you down again.

279
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,823
If you're gonna keep standing
me up for dinner, dad,

280
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,258
you could at least call.

281
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,260
Oh, god. Luke, I'm sorry.

282
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:30,761
I'm just swamped.

283
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:36,934
It's not just the summit,
is it?

284
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,171
Excuse me?

285
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:42,573
This has something to do with
the fact that Batman's missing.

286
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,508
Batman?

287
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,745
Dad, you've been bringing
me here since I was a kid.

288
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,780
I've seen enough over
the years to figure out that

289
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:52,717
there's some connection between
Wayne enterprises and Batman.

290
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:55,553
Somehow I missed that in
the last stockholder's report.

291
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:58,856
In fact, if I was gonna make
an educated guess,

292
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:01,392
I'd say you supply him
with some of his tech.

293
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:03,094
That's some theory.

294
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,362
Dad, I just...

295
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:30,321
It's coming from Wayne tech.

296
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:31,622
The vault.

297
00:21:39,232 --> 00:21:40,898
Don't play games with me.

298
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,968
I don't know about any vault.

299
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,171
Fine.

300
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:48,472
Kill him.

301
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,322
Get us into the vault, Mr. fox,

302
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:07,024
or your son becomes a memory.

303
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:09,660
Stop!

304
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:39,523
Ooh, look at all these
magnificent toys.

305
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,459
You know what we need, Kuttler.

306
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:44,962
Yes. A fleet of trucks,
so we can take it all.

307
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:48,299
But for now, the components
will have to do.

308
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,649
How could you know?

309
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:08,652
This is the 21st century,
Mr. fox.

310
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:12,156
There are no secrets
in this world anymore.

311
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:15,393
Dad!

312
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:20,164
Except the ones
we take to our graves.

313
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,183
Ahhh!

314
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:58,536
You dare to wear
the mantle of the bat.

315
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,226
Get to the transport.

316
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,467
The boy.

317
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:33,137
Ahhh!

318
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,473
Electrocutioner, stop!

319
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:37,174
You're gonna fry up real good,

320
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:38,776
you stupid little...

321
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:46,550
Come back
and fight, you cowards!

322
00:24:58,196 --> 00:24:59,263
Damn it.

323
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:00,531
Help!

324
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:02,766
He needs an ambulance.

325
00:25:11,444 --> 00:25:13,010
You want more, Bruce?

326
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:17,114
Don't take it all for yourself.

327
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:18,115
Don't worry, ladies.

328
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:20,518
There's plenty of me
to go around.

329
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:22,786
Mother's pearls?

330
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:25,155
Where did you get those?

331
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,526
Where did you get them?

332
00:25:35,835 --> 00:25:37,535
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

333
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:47,471
Ah!

334
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:49,640
Still no progress, Tetch?

335
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,809
So much memory.

336
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:53,577
So much experience.

337
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:57,247
It's a delicate job, threading
my way through the layers.

338
00:26:57,249 --> 00:27:00,918
You, on the other hand, could
be reprogrammed in an hour.

339
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,054
You're like wet sand,
compared to this concrete.

340
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:07,057
His trauma runs so deep.

341
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:09,893
It's as if he defines himself
by his pain.

342
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,996
Such madness.

343
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:12,896
Huh?

344
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:14,331
You have to dig deeper.

345
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,302
Push past the trauma.

346
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:25,809
To the child he was, before
he lost his precious parents.

347
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,145
Then, you'll break him.

348
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,185
And then, he'll be ours.

349
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:38,422
You make it sound
so easy, Talia.

350
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:41,659
Easier than dying, Mr. Tetch.

351
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:46,363
We had the detonators. But the
bat was there, waiting for us.

352
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:47,498
Grayson.

353
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,766
Not just him.

354
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,267
The boy.

355
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:51,368
Of course.

356
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:54,104
He was nearly killed,
but I saved him.

357
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:55,706
I saved him.

358
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:57,675
I would expect no less.

359
00:27:57,677 --> 00:28:00,244
We should capture Damian.
Bring him here.

360
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:05,616
I prefer to keep my son
at arm's length.

361
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:07,184
For now.

362
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,520
But if we remove him from the
battle till it's over, then...

363
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,021
I've told you, no.

364
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:16,326
I know why you want
the boy, heretic.

365
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:19,797
I'd stay away from that
rabbit hole, if I were you.

366
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,965
Mind your own business, Tetch.

367
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:26,870
Nothing would give
me more pleasure.

368
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,652
I'm so sorry, Luke.

369
00:28:41,654 --> 00:28:43,821
That's all you have to say?

370
00:28:43,823 --> 00:28:46,690
I was in the vault, dick.
I know.

371
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:49,159
Listen, I don't think
this is the time.

372
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,896
My dad might feel differently,

373
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,164
if he could talk.

374
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:01,505
I came home from one war, only
to walk right into another one.

375
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:02,906
And I want to be a part of it.

376
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:07,277
Best way to help is right
here, at your father's side.

377
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,445
I'm a soldier, dick.

378
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:10,247
I need to be on
the front lines,

379
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,416
not stuck in some lab or boardroom
or freakin' bedside chair.

380
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:15,452
And last night, I saw the
weapons that could help me.

381
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:18,856
Weapons that my dad created
and almost got killed for.

382
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,891
No, Luke, listen.

383
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:23,460
I understand, I really do,
but it's not my call.

384
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:26,930
Not right now. Things are complicated.
Trust me, okay?

385
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:31,935
- Dick...
- Alfred.

386
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,272
I'm on it.

387
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,808
I got to run. I'm sorry.

388
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:55,159
God, I haven't laughed
like that in so long.

389
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:58,428
I noticed you were pretty
miserable when you came in.

390
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,963
One of those days?

391
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,266
One of those lives.

392
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:05,035
Excuse me!

393
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,239
So, you're a cop?

394
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:11,809
A detective.

395
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:14,578
You have a problem with that?

396
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,080
No, not at all.

397
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:19,750
You just don't look the part.

398
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:23,420
What's a cop
supposed to look like?

399
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:24,955
Not as hot as you.

400
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:27,424
Did I just say that out loud?

401
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:29,593
Uh... yeah, you did.

402
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:30,761
You're good.

403
00:30:30,763 --> 00:30:32,362
Actually, I'm terrible.

404
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:35,499
I haven't dated
in over a year and I...

405
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:43,273
- Is something wrong?
- What? No.

406
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:44,174
No.

407
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,610
No. Look,
I do have to go, but...

408
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:49,079
Can I give you my card?
Call me?

409
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:52,015
Yeah, right.

410
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,384
That's not a line, Rene, I...

411
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:56,553
I like you, I really do.

412
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:59,189
But something's come up.

413
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:13,904
Where's the kid?

414
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:19,476
I thought we could
talk alone, katey.

415
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:22,746
How long have you known?

416
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:24,481
Me? Not long.

417
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,984
But Batman's been on to you
from the start.

418
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,522
Look, just so you know,
I haven't given up. I just...

419
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:34,057
Needed to clear my head.

420
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,293
We all need to take off
the mask sometimes.

421
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,932
To remind ourselves that
we're people underneath.

422
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:44,201
Dick Grayson.

423
00:31:44,203 --> 00:31:48,572
You know, when we were kids and I'd see
you at all those society bashes...

424
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:50,007
I had quite a crush on you.

425
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:52,609
Really? I thought you
were totally annoying.

426
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,880
Took me a while to get a
hang of the girl thing.

427
00:31:56,882 --> 00:32:00,183
Yeah, me too.

428
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:02,019
Why reveal yourself?

429
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:04,855
Call it a hunch. Come on.

430
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:09,192
I don't have a concussion.

431
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:12,062
I wasn't aware you received
a medical degree

432
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:14,598
while you were in the
himalayas, master Damian.

433
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,035
I've been hurt worse than this
sparring with my grandfather.

434
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:20,370
I'd hardly hold Ra's al ghul up

435
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:23,974
as an example of
enlightened child-rearing.

436
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:26,543
Master dick was quite explicit.

437
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:30,147
At least 24 hours
of observation.

438
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:32,482
He's not my father!

439
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:33,650
And neither are you.

440
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:35,319
And for that, young man,

441
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:38,488
you should be
profoundly grateful.

442
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:50,200
He saved my life
once before, you know.

443
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:53,971
In a way, he created me.

444
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:56,673
Yeah, he does that.

445
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:58,608
He pissed me off.

446
00:32:58,610 --> 00:32:59,710
He does that, too.

447
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,348
<i>When I got</i>
<i>kicked out of the military,</i>

448
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:09,319
<i>my life was a blur of sex,</i>
<i>drugs and techno-house.</i>

449
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,989
<i>But I thought I could</i>
<i>take care of myself.</i>

450
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,928
How ya doin', gorgeous?

451
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,496
Out of my way, asshole.

452
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:20,664
I don't think so.

453
00:33:23,936 --> 00:33:26,203
You little bitch!

454
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,294
You're welcome.

455
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:05,475
After that night, I swore I'd never
need Batman or anyone saving me again.

456
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:09,413
My mother and sister were victims
of the animals out there.

457
00:34:09,415 --> 00:34:10,514
Not me.

458
00:34:10,516 --> 00:34:12,149
I get that, Kate.

459
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:14,317
But it doesn't mean
you have to be alone.

460
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:24,828
Ahhh!

461
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:41,111
You made a big mistake
coming here.

462
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:52,022
I was trained to never
make mistakes.

463
00:34:52,024 --> 00:34:53,824
Just like you.

464
00:35:04,036 --> 00:35:05,735
Don't fight it, Damian.

465
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:09,139
I've had the flaws
bred out of me.

466
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:12,809
But you... You're just a boy.

467
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,815
What was it like
growing up with him?

468
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,053
When I was a kid,
I idolized him.

469
00:35:23,055 --> 00:35:26,256
Hell, I wanted to be him.

470
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:28,158
But the older I got,
the more I realized

471
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,826
that I didn't know him at all.

472
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:31,895
How could I?

473
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:34,998
Bruce Wayne is as
much a mask as Batman.

474
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,169
And I think the only thing
behind those masks is pain.

475
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:41,505
A pain he refuses
to share with anyone.

476
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,474
So what was it like?

477
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,377
Lonely.

478
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:41,631
It's Alfred.

479
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:43,500
Your Butler
is a part of this, too?

480
00:36:43,502 --> 00:36:45,135
Trust me, he's a total badass.

481
00:36:45,137 --> 00:36:46,469
Yeah?

482
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:48,705
<i>Master Damian is gone, sir.</i>

483
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:21,938
Where am I?

484
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:28,778
What the hell are you doing?

485
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:33,250
Unfortunately, I have no more
choice in this than you do.

486
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,422
Who are you?

487
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:46,429
I'm you, Damian...

488
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:50,267
All grown up.

489
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:52,936
You're not me. You can't be.

490
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:55,905
I'm the product of
a program that your...

491
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:58,775
Our grandfather initiated.

492
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:01,511
He wanted to create
the perfect soldier.

493
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,747
They used your DNA

494
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:06,816
and put it through a process
of accelerated growth.

495
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:09,019
Most of the prototypes
died quickly.

496
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,388
But I survived.

497
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,624
I was the strongest
of them all.

498
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,559
Still...

499
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:18,595
I was an empty shell,
till Mr. Tetch here

500
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:21,398
brought me to
full consciousness.

501
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,667
And as good a job as he did,

502
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:26,369
there's always been
something missing.

503
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:28,838
A void.

504
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,641
And I'm going
to fill that void...

505
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:33,543
With you.

506
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,113
Everything in there

507
00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:39,382
is going in here.

508
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:42,085
You, brother,

509
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:44,688
will provide me with a soul.

510
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,857
The hell, I am.

511
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,929
I don't understand

512
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,831
why she just doesn't grow
another one of you.

513
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,767
- She's got a freezer full...
- Are you insane?

514
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,671
Mother.

515
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,147
How dare you!

516
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:12,682
It wasn't my idea.

517
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,851
This lunatic said
he'd kill me if I...

518
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:15,985
Shut up!

519
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:17,954
You'll suffer for this.

520
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:22,792
My entire life
I've been suffering!

521
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:26,563
Tell me, what is a man
without memories?

522
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:28,565
I want to know you,

523
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:31,301
and love you, as he does.

524
00:39:31,303 --> 00:39:34,037
I want to feel you in my heart.

525
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,538
In my blood.

526
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:39,342
I've always served you
without question.

527
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:41,878
I've never asked
anything of you.

528
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:46,416
Please, let me have this.

529
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,921
You poor tormented creature,

530
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:55,825
how could I not have felt
the depths of your pain?

531
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:58,828
How could a mother have
left her child so alone...

532
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,431
In the dark.

533
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,205
How could you
just kill him like that?

534
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:11,508
- He was...
- He was flawed.

535
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,877
What about me,
am I flawed, too?

536
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:15,845
Remove all memories
of this incident

537
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:18,348
and then make the other
necessary adjustments.

538
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,682
Adjustments?

539
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:21,518
You're of no use
to me like this.

540
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,787
Recalcitrant, emotional.

541
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:27,357
Your father's influence,
no doubt.

542
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,759
Onyx, get this
trash out of here.

543
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,698
Good thing Alfred
had the foresight

544
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,201
to put a tracker on
the kid's uniform.

545
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:40,370
The sisters of perpetual grace.

546
00:40:40,372 --> 00:40:43,373
A respected religious order
with missions across the world.

547
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:45,775
Perfect front
for criminal scumbags.

548
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,968
This isn't gonna be easy.

549
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,040
Nuns with m60s and katanas?

550
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,809
That would make them nunjas.

551
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:42,532
Kind of hate I let you talk
me into using rubber bullets.

552
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:00,083
Looks like you
could use a little help.

553
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:06,122
Hello, nurse.

554
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:07,490
Luke?

555
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:09,626
You want a megaphone
to announce that?

556
00:42:09,628 --> 00:42:11,060
Call me Batwing.

557
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:16,232
Batwing? That's original.

558
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:20,537
Can't say I'm not
glad to see you.

559
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:46,696
It's the bats.

560
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:48,064
Three of them!

561
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,732
Three?

562
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,001
We retreat.

563
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:53,136
Why?

564
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,573
The compound is expendable.

565
00:42:56,575 --> 00:42:59,275
We have more urgent matters
to attend to.

566
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:00,643
Come.

567
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:17,927
Kill him! Kill him!

568
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:43,953
Aah!

569
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:09,479
It's me, it's your son.

570
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:13,816
Come on, father.

571
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:24,360
Batman, we need you.

572
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,847
Can you blow those doors?

573
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,284
God's not going to like this.

574
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:50,720
I don't think she's
been here for a while.

575
00:45:13,645 --> 00:45:14,944
This way!

576
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:47,176
Come on, father.

577
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,217
How are you?

578
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:57,253
In one piece, which is more
than I can say for this place.

579
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:20,102
No.

580
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,454
Thanks for saving
our butts back there, Luke.

581
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:41,290
Yeah, too bad they got away.

582
00:47:41,292 --> 00:47:45,027
Well, dad always wanted me
to work with Bruce Wayne.

583
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:46,929
I'm proud to be
a part of your team.

584
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:50,566
We can handle this on our own.

585
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:54,570
Nightwing, Robin,
back to Gotham.

586
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:58,307
You're welcome.

587
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:09,752
You really should be resting.

588
00:48:09,754 --> 00:48:11,320
The summit's tomorrow.

589
00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:13,322
It's been a week, I'm fine.

590
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,392
Like father, like son.

591
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,062
All things considered,
master Bruce,

592
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:22,832
you're in surprisingly
good condition.

593
00:48:22,834 --> 00:48:25,534
She treated you...
Treated us...

594
00:48:25,536 --> 00:48:28,738
Like we were machines
that she could just program.

595
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,573
That's all we were to her.

596
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:33,376
After Bruce Wayne completes his
hosting duties at the summit,

597
00:48:33,378 --> 00:48:35,411
we'll gather any leads
we can to find her.

598
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:38,614
Why wait? I'll call in
Kate and Luke and then...

599
00:48:38,616 --> 00:48:40,182
No.

600
00:48:40,184 --> 00:48:42,051
You shouldn't have involved
them in the first place.

601
00:48:42,053 --> 00:48:44,387
Batwing pretty much
involved himself.

602
00:48:44,389 --> 00:48:45,955
And Batwoman?

603
00:48:45,957 --> 00:48:48,157
Did she force you
to reveal our secrets?

604
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,194
You weren't here, sir.

605
00:48:52,196 --> 00:48:55,131
Master dick made
a judgment call,

606
00:48:55,133 --> 00:48:57,166
and I think it was
the right one.

607
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:01,137
Maybe so, but from here on...

608
00:49:01,139 --> 00:49:02,505
It's only family.

609
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:06,976
Kate's going through the hard
drive we pulled from the convent.

610
00:49:06,978 --> 00:49:08,778
Fine, but when she's done,
that's it.

611
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,881
But we have to... -You're
not Batman anymore, dick!

612
00:49:11,883 --> 00:49:13,950
I call the shots around here.

613
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:21,924
He's been through an extraordinary
ordeal, master dick.

614
00:49:21,926 --> 00:49:24,293
Yeah? Well, so have we.

615
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:27,163
As the summit kicks off today,

616
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:29,398
politicians and dignitaries
from more than 20 nations

617
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,400
converge on Gotham, for what
promises to be

618
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:34,403
<i>a pivotal look at how technology
will shape our future.</i>

619
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:36,172
<i>Minutes ago, Bruce Wayne...</i>

620
00:49:36,174 --> 00:49:37,640
<i>arrived to deliver</i>
<i>the keynote address</i>

621
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:39,475
<i>that will kick off</i>
<i>the conference</i>

622
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:42,278
<i>and also unveil ground-breaking
technological advances.</i>

623
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,315
<i>Up next, researchers discover</i>
<i>mysterious findings on Mars...</i>

624
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:51,487
What do you mean he
doesn't want my help?

625
00:49:52,924 --> 00:49:55,157
He says he's grateful for
everything you've done, Kate,

626
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:57,159
but he just feels that...

627
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:59,161
Oh, hell, you know
what he's like.

628
00:50:04,469 --> 00:50:06,369
He just wants to keep it
in the family.

629
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:10,272
I thought you wanted me
to be part of the family.

630
00:50:10,274 --> 00:50:13,309
Yeah, what do I know?

631
00:50:13,311 --> 00:50:15,044
<i>Find anything on that</i>
<i>hard drive, yet?</i>

632
00:50:15,046 --> 00:50:17,213
No, I gave it to Batwing.

633
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,716
I figured his father's tech
could help us.

634
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:24,186
<i>I'm sorry about this, Kate.</i>

635
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:26,222
If it were up to me...

636
00:50:26,224 --> 00:50:28,691
Nothing to be sorry about.
Goodbye, dick.

637
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:43,372
Dad!

638
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:21,444
<i>As the co-chair of</i>
<i>Wayne enterprises,</i>

639
00:51:21,446 --> 00:51:26,048
<i>it is my profound privilege</i>
<i>to present our host.</i>

640
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,783
<i>A man of fellowship,</i>

641
00:51:27,785 --> 00:51:29,685
<i>a man of kindness,</i>

642
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:32,088
<i>a man of peace.</i>

643
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:34,023
<i>Mr. Bruce Wayne.</i>

644
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:55,444
Soon, we'll be through
the looking glass, gentlemen.

645
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:59,148
<i>You're all wearing beta</i>
<i>versions of Wayne tech's</i>

646
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:01,283
<i>latest breakthrough</i>
<i>in communications.</i>

647
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:02,918
<i>With these translators,</i>

648
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,387
<i>we hope to build Bridges</i>
<i>between language and culture.</i>

649
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:10,793
- Hmm.
- What?

650
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:13,062
We're about to take
over the world.

651
00:52:13,064 --> 00:52:15,564
Can't a man dress
for the occasion?

652
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:17,500
Idiot!

653
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:20,803
Walrus.

654
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:23,072
<i>The world has become</i>
<i>a more dangerous place.</i>

655
00:52:23,074 --> 00:52:25,508
<i>To meet these threats,</i>
<i>Wayne tech and S.T.A.R. Labs</i>

656
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:27,443
<i>have developed</i>
<i>the watchtower initiative.</i>

657
00:52:27,445 --> 00:52:30,646
<i>Prepare to embark</i>
<i>on the greatest adventure.</i>

658
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:34,143
Dad doesn't even
remember doing it.

659
00:53:34,145 --> 00:53:35,544
He was programmed.

660
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:37,646
But why?

661
00:53:37,648 --> 00:53:39,715
Somehow, they knew
I had that drive.

662
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:43,319
Like they knew about the vault
at Wayne enterprises.

663
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:44,653
Bruce told them.

664
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:45,654
Not my father.

665
00:53:45,656 --> 00:53:47,489
Talia had him
in there for weeks

666
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:51,160
and he suddenly snaps out of
it just because we show up?

667
00:53:51,162 --> 00:53:53,996
No, you're wrong. He's fine.

668
00:53:53,998 --> 00:53:55,731
No, he's not.

669
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:57,266
He's not fine.

670
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:58,934
She got to him.

671
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,670
She's not finished, is she?

672
00:54:01,672 --> 00:54:03,405
She's just getting started.

673
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:07,910
Found this on the hard drive.

674
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:12,181
There are vice-presidents
on this list.

675
00:54:12,183 --> 00:54:13,515
Military and corporate leaders,

676
00:54:13,517 --> 00:54:15,451
the vice-chancellor of Germany.

677
00:54:15,453 --> 00:54:17,419
So, why would Talia have this?

678
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:21,090
What if Talia got to the men and women
on that list, brainwashed them?

679
00:54:21,092 --> 00:54:24,426
Then that would place the league of
shadows' influence in every country.

680
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:27,296
She'd control the world.

681
00:54:27,298 --> 00:54:30,733
My god, kid,
your mom's got game.

682
00:54:30,735 --> 00:54:34,036
And all the leaders she would
need are at the summit...

683
00:54:34,038 --> 00:54:35,838
Along with Bruce Wayne.

684
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:49,985
Master...

685
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:56,825
Status?

686
00:54:56,827 --> 00:54:58,360
Just a second.

687
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:01,630
Activating power boost.

688
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:04,933
You're on, Tetch.

689
00:55:04,935 --> 00:55:07,936
Beginning brain wave
synchronization.

690
00:55:07,938 --> 00:55:09,972
<i>So many minds.</i>

691
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:11,407
<i>So little time.</i>

692
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:13,642
And a new age dawns.

693
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:16,512
Even Ra's al ghul
couldn't achieve this.

694
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:23,585
<i>Hey, Batwing,</i>
<i>need a ride in the... Batwing?</i>

695
00:55:23,587 --> 00:55:25,487
<i>Very funny.</i>

696
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:28,991
You sure they won't
know we're coming?

697
00:55:28,993 --> 00:55:31,527
<i>Not once we jam their radar and
shut down the alarm system.</i>

698
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:33,595
Good thing you got us
those schematics.

699
00:55:33,597 --> 00:55:34,997
<i>Hope my dad understands</i>

700
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:36,639
<i>when he finds out</i>
<i>I hacked his computer.</i>

701
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:39,601
Got 'em.

702
00:55:39,603 --> 00:55:41,070
Engaging auto-pilot.

703
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:12,701
Heads up, looks like
we've got company.

704
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:19,775
How long, Kuttler?

705
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:22,378
Twenty minutes at most.

706
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,779
Make it 10.

707
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:26,315
Get it.

708
00:56:26,317 --> 00:56:28,083
I brought you
a little something.

709
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:42,564
We've got to find the
dignitaries and evacuate them.

710
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:44,032
What about father?

711
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:46,201
Our first priority is
getting those people out.

712
00:56:46,203 --> 00:56:47,603
Not mine.

713
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:03,185
We don't have time
for this, Damian.

714
00:57:03,187 --> 00:57:04,853
Join us or die.

715
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:08,924
Father.

716
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:33,382
<i>The league of shadows</i>
<i>compels you to be one with us.</i>

717
00:57:33,384 --> 00:57:35,551
<i>There is no you.</i>

718
00:57:35,553 --> 00:57:37,219
<i>You have no home.</i>

719
00:57:37,221 --> 00:57:38,987
<i>You have no people.</i>

720
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:47,756
Ahhh!

721
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:32,234
That can't be good.

722
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:49,117
<i>You are the league of shadows</i>
<i>and it is your home.</i>

723
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,752
<i>We are your people.</i>

724
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:52,220
About time you came back.

725
00:59:52,222 --> 00:59:54,089
Indeed.

726
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:04,800
Come on!

727
01:00:07,071 --> 01:00:08,170
No!

728
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:14,543
Justice!

729
01:00:14,545 --> 01:00:16,845
Not vengeance.

730
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:26,321
Damn.

731
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:28,557
<i>Batwing to Robin. Uh...</i>

732
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:29,958
Got a situation here.

733
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:33,328
I need you to manually
transfer power

734
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:35,964
from the damaged thruster
to the remaining two.

735
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:39,468
Oh, crap!

736
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:41,003
Dad's gonna kill me.

737
01:00:51,348 --> 01:00:53,815
Big dirty...

738
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:35,657
<i>The league of shadows...</i>

739
01:01:35,659 --> 01:01:37,259
Shut it down.

740
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:44,733
<i>You have no...</i>

741
01:01:44,735 --> 01:01:46,368
<i>You are the league</i>
<i>of shadows...</i>

742
01:02:09,326 --> 01:02:10,826
Bloody hell.

743
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:17,666
Huh?

744
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:39,688
<i>Cutting it kinda close!</i>

745
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:41,089
<i>Hurry up, kid!</i>

746
01:03:32,074 --> 01:03:33,408
Well done, beloved.

747
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:35,877
We will at least
have this victory.

748
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:42,150
Finish him.

749
01:03:46,256 --> 01:03:49,591
Bruce! Don't.

750
01:03:49,593 --> 01:03:52,027
That's what
it's all about in the end,

751
01:03:52,029 --> 01:03:53,662
isn't it, mother?

752
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:55,030
Not the vision
of a better world

753
01:03:55,032 --> 01:03:56,932
my grandfather had.

754
01:03:56,934 --> 01:03:58,867
It's just about control.

755
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:00,502
Start with the bastard.

756
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:02,637
We can always make more.

757
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:05,607
Bruce, you don't kill.

758
01:04:05,609 --> 01:04:07,309
You've never killed.

759
01:04:08,879 --> 01:04:10,946
Don't let her win.

760
01:04:10,948 --> 01:04:13,148
Don't let her take your soul.

761
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:15,217
If anything,
I have cleansed it.

762
01:04:15,219 --> 01:04:17,886
I washed away his trauma.

763
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:19,421
Finish them.

764
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:22,457
You brought us all together

765
01:04:22,459 --> 01:04:24,860
because you
understood our pain,

766
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:27,796
our loneliness better
than anyone else could.

767
01:04:27,798 --> 01:04:29,831
We needed family.

768
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:31,233
We needed you.

769
01:04:33,803 --> 01:04:34,903
Shoot him!

770
01:04:34,905 --> 01:04:37,639
You're not just a mask.

771
01:04:37,641 --> 01:04:39,374
You're a man.

772
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:47,616
The best man I've ever known.

773
01:04:51,154 --> 01:04:51,987
No!

774
01:04:51,989 --> 01:04:53,655
Can't fight it.

775
01:04:53,657 --> 01:04:55,156
Yes, you can, damn it!

776
01:04:55,158 --> 01:04:58,159
For the little boy who
lost his world in that alley.

777
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:01,329
Enough!

778
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:12,274
I'm sorry.

779
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,310
I'm so sorry.

780
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:18,280
It's all right, father.

781
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:26,154
That's for what you did
to my father, bitch!

782
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:31,092
It's over, mother.

783
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:33,862
Your grand plan has ended.

784
01:05:33,864 --> 01:05:35,964
How is it I ever loved
either of you?

785
01:05:35,966 --> 01:05:37,766
I don't think you ever did.

786
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:40,702
Oh, beloved, you have no idea.

787
01:05:40,704 --> 01:05:45,240
I have thought of little else
for the last 12 years.

788
01:05:45,242 --> 01:05:48,777
But nothing, not my passion,

789
01:05:48,779 --> 01:05:51,046
not the death of my father,

790
01:05:51,048 --> 01:05:54,382
not even our child
could bring you to my side.

791
01:05:54,384 --> 01:05:57,886
I know now,
I will never have you

792
01:05:57,888 --> 01:05:59,254
in this life.

793
01:05:59,256 --> 01:06:01,056
But perhaps, in death.

794
01:06:01,058 --> 01:06:02,557
Get her!

795
01:06:18,607 --> 01:06:20,208
She played us again.

796
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:03,351
From what nightwing said,

797
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:06,187
once the programming
is broken, it can't be reset.

798
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:09,958
Not yours, not anybody's.

799
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:13,528
Well, I suppose Tetch could've done
it, if he hadn't lost his head.

800
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:17,665
I'm proud of you, Kate.

801
01:07:17,667 --> 01:07:20,301
Gabrielle and Elizabeth
would be proud, too.

802
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:23,405
I hope so.

803
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:29,577
I'm a... a little early.

804
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:31,980
No, no.

805
01:07:31,982 --> 01:07:33,415
You're right on time.

806
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:52,567
I'm heading to the tower.

807
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:56,071
Thanks for lunch, Alfred.

808
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:00,842
- What's going on?
- Master Bruce is having

809
01:08:00,844 --> 01:08:03,278
a heart-to-heart with Damian.

810
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,780
One can't help feeling bad.

811
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:07,882
Despite her madness,

812
01:08:07,884 --> 01:08:09,417
she was his mother.
