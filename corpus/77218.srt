1
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:58,171
Good evening, I'm Marci Feld.

2
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:01,008
Oh, thank you.

3
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,105
Please! Oh, please, stop it!

4
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,980
Enough. That's enough.

5
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,620
Tonight, the American Jewish
Federation...

6
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,591
You Jews, you wonderful Jews.

7
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,562
Who needs Santa Claus?
Am I right?

8
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,498
Tonight, the AJF presents
its highest honor,

9
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,900
its Global Humanitarian Award,

10
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,929
to the finest human being
I have ever known.

11
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:31,942
This award goes to my father,
Mr. Ben Feld.

12
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,817
We love you, bubby!

13
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,483
Ben! We're here for you!

14
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,958
Isn't he handsome?

15
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,188
And kosher, right?

16
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,330
Love you.

17
00:03:56,402 --> 00:04:00,668
Now, most of you may think of my
father as, first and foremost,

18
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,834
an incredibly successful
corporate legend,

19
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:09,109
but he has always taught me
about responsibility

20
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,116
and giving something back.

21
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:16,645
He would say, "Sweetheart, you
are the prettiest, the smartest,

22
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,419
"the most perfect girl
in the whole world,

23
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:23,394
so you must reach out
to all of those who aren't."

24
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,927
Powerful.

25
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,730
Doesn't Marci
look fabulous?

26
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:31,929
Ultra-Marci.

27
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,231
Mega-Marci.

28
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,500
The full Marci.

29
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,371
Ten years ago,

30
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,842
we opened our first
shelter for the homeless,

31
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:42,938
helping those in need
of a bed, counseling,

32
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,244
and shampoo and conditioner.

33
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:49,948
Next came a drug rehab program
called "Marci Cares,"

34
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:54,823
and today, there are 25
branches of Marci Cares

35
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:58,057
all across the tri-state area.

36
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,998
Can you imagine being
addicted to heroin?

37
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,500
Oh, it's heartbreaking.

38
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,765
But does the weight
stay off?

39
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:11,605
I only wish that my mother
Sheila could be with us

40
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,839
on this joyous occasion.

41
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:18,111
But, as some of you know,
six years ago,

42
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:21,915
while we were opening
a free clinic in Johannesburg,

43
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,253
she was tragically killed by
a savage South African leopard.

44
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,693
It is in her memory

45
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:35,928
that I would now like to present
this medal of mercy,

46
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,264
a medal from Marci.

47
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,102
Tonight, this award
goes to my father,

48
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,607
Mr. Ben Feld!

49
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,165
We have problems, sir.

50
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,073
Daddy?!

51
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:49,876
Daddy, where are you going?

52
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,144
Was it the entree?

53
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,209
Daddy...

54
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,447
Daddy...

55
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,453
What's going on?

56
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,750
Marci, incoming.

57
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,655
This way, Miss Feld.

58
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,086
Daddy, what is wrong? I...

59
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:06,597
Shh! Sweetheart, sit.

60
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,134
The corporate crisis
centering on Ben Feld

61
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,567
has begun to escalate
out of control.

62
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,035
I got here as
fast as I could.

63
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,538
Daddy, what is this?

64
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,267
Daddy's busy.

65
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,468
...include the notorious
urban record label

66
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,135
called Felony Assault.

67
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,339
Earlier today,
that label released

68
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:25,180
a new CD by controversial
gangsta rap star Dr. S.

69
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,843
Dr. S has been
a hard-core success...

70
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,181
I don't know this person.

71
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:29,846
He's a rapper.

72
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,583
His songs are known
for their extreme sexual

73
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:32,681
and often violent content.

74
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,693
His latest release, however,

75
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,695
is by far his most provocative.

76
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,231
Controversy is erupting,
protesters are converging

77
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,357
on Feldco headquarters
in Manhattan.

78
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:45,530
An angry mob is calling for
blood, specifically the blood

79
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:46,902
of mogul Ben Feld...

80
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,531
Oh, Daddy, is that your picture?

81
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:49,802
...honored tonight
as a great humanitarian.

82
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,571
I am here with senator

83
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:54,272
and leading media watchdog
Mary Ellen Spinkle.

84
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,336
Oh, no.

85
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,110
I am appalled.

86
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,048
Is she wearing
a helmet?

87
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,380
I am outraged.

88
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:03,013
I am so disgusted

89
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,557
that I can barely speak...
but I will.

90
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,559
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

91
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,721
This recording
is unspeakably offensive,

92
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,288
not just to all Americans,

93
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,732
but to all human beings
everywhere.

94
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,202
I will not quote the lyrics
because, as a Christian,

95
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,705
I cannot even pronounce
some of the words.

96
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,537
But let me just read you
some of the song titles:

97
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,906
"Shoot the Teacher."

98
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,069
Oh, my...

99
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,840
- Yes!
- Not good.

100
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,506
"I Am the King of Your Mouth."

101
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,243
- Very nice.
- Uh-oh. - Ooh!

102
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,807
"You My Special Bitch."

103
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,352
- Wait...
- Mmm!

104
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,752
"I Love You Because
I'm High."

105
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,620
"Six Grades Are Plenty."

106
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:42,650
Lane, did you ask Legal?
Do I really own this label?

107
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:45,390
You bought it years ago
as part of a package.

108
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,933
"It Ain't My Baby Because
I Don't Like You."

109
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,262
This is it.

110
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,700
...and "The Power in my Pants."

111
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,572
Has Dr. S gone too far?

112
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,937
I don't blame these rappers,

113
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,806
I blame the man who profits
from this perversion!

114
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,870
I blame the man who makes
his dirty millions

115
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,883
from the wholesale slaughter
of our children's innocence!

116
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,920
I blame an American Satan,
Ben Feld!

117
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,055
I am calling for a complete
boycott of all Feldco products

118
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:17,755
including movies, newspapers,
TV shows,

119
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,593
and DVDs!

120
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,997
A boycott?
A boycott?!

121
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,332
Are you listening to this,
Mr. Feld?

122
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:27,270
Or I should say "Mr. Filth."

123
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,739
Ben Feld...

124
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,799
you are a dead man!

125
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,043
- Ben?
- Uh-oh...

126
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,136
Ben!

127
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,145
Daddy!

128
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:36,613
Ben, don't die!

129
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:44,188
The moral firestorm
blazing around Ben Feld

130
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,919
has raged into a white-hot
economic inferno.

131
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,926
A what?!

132
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,689
Pickets have closed
record stores nationwide.

133
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:51,923
My God... I'm choking...

134
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,157
We have contacted Tubby Fenders,

135
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:54,426
the president of Felony Assault,

136
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,626
who is currently serving time

137
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,635
- in a penitentiary.
- Look...

138
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,102
Yo.

139
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,263
Mr. Fenders, what about Dr. S?

140
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,637
Dr. S would never apologize!

141
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,336
He would never bow down
to the white man's censorship!

142
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:08,471
Just like me, he has been
unjustly oppressed and accused!

143
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,847
Tubby Fenders, the president
of Felony Assault Records.

144
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,249
Give me that remote!

145
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,308
Big baby!

146
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:16,547
I can't believe this.

147
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,715
Everything I worked for
my whole life,

148
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,190
it's all going
to crumble.

149
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,386
Baby, I'm so sorry.

150
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:23,393
Daddy!

151
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:24,622
Because you
have to see all this.

152
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:27,131
Because I...

153
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,190
I just wish I had a son.

154
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,300
Why would you want a son?

155
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:35,431
Someone to take over,
to take charge,

156
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,738
so that you wouldn't
have to worry.

157
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,745
Someone we could trust.

158
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:45,182
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

159
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,583
I just two weeks, we are going
to put Ben Feld on trial

160
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:51,214
before the entire civilized
world and China...

161
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,814
That's it! That's it!

162
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:53,551
I'm out of here!

163
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:54,558
What?!

164
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:55,559
Uh-oh. Dr. Skellar!

165
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:56,595
I need Dr. Skellar!

166
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,359
Oh, Daddy! Look...
Look what's happening.

167
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,524
I can't stay here!
I... I...

168
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,932
You get back in that bed,
Your Highness.

169
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,503
Mr. Feld...

170
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,801
Mr. Feld, you are an
extremely sick man.

171
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,465
Now, no visitors,

172
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,942
and nurse, get rid
of that television

173
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,511
and I need 10 cc's
of Valium right now.

174
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:14,546
Oh, thank you.

175
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,581
For your father.

176
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:16,876
Oh.

177
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:17,916
- Ben...
- What?

178
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,781
I'm going to put you
in complete isolation

179
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,217
for two weeks
for your own good.

180
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,778
No cell phones, no faxes,
no Internet, nothing.

181
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,084
Like the '80s?

182
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,148
I'm warning you, Ben.

183
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,717
If you have any more
stress, it could kill you.

184
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,628
Sweetheart, please,
just go.

185
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,327
You don't think

186
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:39,496
the rules apply to you, do you?

187
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,199
Ben, you're in real danger.

188
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:42,900
You're a very sick man.

189
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,967
Thank God you're rich.

190
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,568
You're here in this hospital

191
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,514
and you're going to stay here
until I release you.

192
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,047
Sorry.

193
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,158
Marce!

194
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,597
Oh, Marci,
I can't believe it!

195
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,692
Are you all right?
Is your dad okay?

196
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:10,701
Have you bathed?

197
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,702
Look, chocolates!

198
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:12,760
Did you get a chance
to bathe yet?

199
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,169
They're for you...
and your dad.

200
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,800
But I feel so useless.

201
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:22,373
I love my father so much
and I can't even help him.

202
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,576
And he doesn't... he doesn't
really want me to try.

203
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,209
Why not?

204
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,983
He said he wished he had a son.

205
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,385
Maybe he's right.

206
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,554
Maybe I'm not strong enough
or smart enough.

207
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,621
Maybe I am just a socialite.

208
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,631
Excuse me?

209
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,894
Just a socialite?

210
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:45,232
You serve on the boards
of three major museums.

211
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:46,328
You are a guest editor

212
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,339
at Vogue, Vanity Fair,
and Mademoiselle.

213
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,841
And last year alone,
you raised over seven figures

214
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,969
for literacy, muscular dystrophy
and cancer.

215
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,842
In this town, you are cancer.

216
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,782
No, but this involves law suits
and spin control

217
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,684
and the whole worldwide
entertainment industry.

218
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,085
Which is your life.

219
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,749
You introduced Princess Diana
to Mother Teresa

220
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:06,917
at your bat mitzvah.

221
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:07,924
They had cake.

222
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,152
Well, not Diana.

223
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,820
Time Magazine has declared you

224
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,864
the most charming white woman
in America under 50.

225
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,924
Oh, except we're
talking about rap.

226
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,434
And, you know, the inner cities

227
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,165
and censorship and the cultural
legacy of black people.

228
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,675
Well, I happen
to adore black people.

229
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,675
- Word.
- Word up.

230
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,676
Word perfect.

231
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,770
You can get anybody
to do anything you want.

232
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,109
It's your gift.

233
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,113
Yeah, yeah,

234
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:32,343
yeah, and my dad
is being isolated.

235
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,046
But I've only got two weeks
until the hearings.

236
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,110
So get out there...

237
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,554
...and show your father
just what you're capable of.

238
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,956
You say, "Watch out, America,
here comes Marci."

239
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,960
Yeah, I'm going to go see
that Dr. S,

240
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,461
in person, on his own turf.

241
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,226
I'll explain everything
and we can work together.

242
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,323
Marci cares.

243
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,424
Marci loves.

244
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,935
Marci saves her father's life.

245
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,800
- Yay!
- Oh!

246
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,362
So where is this Dr. S?

247
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,372
Uptown.

248
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,874
- Uptown.
- All the way.

249
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,111
Yeah, someone call

250
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,519
for a doctor?

251
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,720
You say you want the power,
the power to see

252
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,457
You say you want the power,
the power to be

253
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,431
You want to see the power,
then give it a glance

254
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,263
Come on, I got the power,
the power in my pants

255
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,599
You say you want the power,
the power so fine

256
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,662
Screaming for the power,
the power that's mine

257
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,106
If I showed you all the power,
you'd go into a trance

258
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,406
I have you in my power,
with the power in my pants

259
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,207
We want the power

260
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,106
Try not to stare

261
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,811
We want the power

262
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,750
Give me some air

263
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,083
We want the power

264
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,417
Give, give, give

265
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,957
Give me some drums

266
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,719
We want the power

267
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,056
Here it comes

268
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,097
You say you want the power,
the power to come

269
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,155
You want to ride
the power to the maximum

270
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:57,134
You say you use the power
to enhance romance

271
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,103
Come on, take some power,
the power in my pants

272
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,230
You say you need the power,
the power supreme

273
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,298
You want to touch the power,
till you make it your dream

274
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,275
- You play with the power...
- Excuse... Hi.

275
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,402
You know it's your chance

276
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:07,775
Got a magic wand, yeah,
the power in my pants

277
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,644
Hold on to your purse.

278
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,182
We want the power

279
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,683
'Cause he got game

280
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:15,276
We want the power

281
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,753
You're playing games

282
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,813
- All right!
- Yeah!

283
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,155
Feel my song inside your thong

284
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,092
The power that stick,
that knows every trick

285
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:26,029
If you can't live with it,
then you don't know dick.

286
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,696
Thank you.

287
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,608
Sit down.

288
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,739
Sit your asses down.

289
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:44,942
All right.

290
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:46,075
How y'all feeling?

291
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,948
Sick!

292
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,918
Ain't y'all glad
there's a doctor in the house?

293
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,890
Yeah!

294
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,482
I want to give
a special shout out

295
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,585
to someone who is near
and dear to my heart.

296
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,653
I think you all know
who I'm talking about.

297
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,063
That's right.

298
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,658
She's a recording artist,

299
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,397
and she's got a workout video

300
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,598
and her own perfume.

301
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:11,234
And she got an ass you just want
to take pictures with.

302
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,175
You know who I'm talking about...

303
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,837
the Booty Monster herself...

304
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,276
Miss Yolanda Quinones.

305
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,143
Yolanda!

306
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,351
Am I late?

307
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,929
You're late,
but you're right on time.

308
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,059
Come on, sit down

309
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,070
while the Doctor
put on the clinic.

310
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,470
Hey, Medic, show 'em
how we operate.

311
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:47,542
Hi.

312
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,070
Go. Go talk to him.

313
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,411
For your father.

314
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:52,450
Mingle.

315
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,586
Spanky, here.

316
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:59,123
Coming off,

317
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,216
coming through
and going back.

318
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,760
Dr. S, hi.
Marci Feld.

319
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:03,886
It's a pleasure.

320
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,088
Really.

321
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,098
Who are you?

322
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,999
Um, I'm Ben Feld's daughter.

323
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,627
Anyway, I can see
you're very busy,

324
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,262
so I'm just going
to take a second.

325
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,601
But we really do have to chat

326
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,901
about, you know, your new CD.

327
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,303
Why?

328
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,436
Well, I'm sure you know
all about the hoo-ha.

329
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:21,740
Please. Ooh!

330
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,908
I'm also sure you're every bit
as upset about it as I am.

331
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,450
You know.

332
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,112
You're upset?
You're hot and bothered?

333
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,816
Um...

334
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,323
Anyway, I have a plan.

335
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,916
- You do, huh?
- Yeah.

336
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,255
You're just going to love it.

337
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,295
I bet I will.

338
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,625
Oh, yeah.

339
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,756
Ew, this is...
all covered with you.

340
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,767
You know, you could sell that.

341
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,859
Oh, yeah?

342
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:44,868
- On eBay.
- Oh...

343
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,029
30 seconds.

344
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,094
Oh, okay.

345
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,332
Well, here it is.

346
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,672
Um... next week,
you're supposed to appear live

347
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,609
at the MTVAwards.

348
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,204
Perfect... it's global,
millions of people watching.

349
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,509
Just the perfect place

350
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,677
for you to say to the entire
world, "I'm really sorry.

351
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,653
"I went too far.

352
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:05,781
Ben Feld is fabulous,
and I apo..."

353
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,655
I'm good. Thank you.

354
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,660
"...and I sincerely apologize."

355
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:13,687
Um, well, tomorrow morning
at 10:00...

356
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,257
I thought we could
kick things off, you know,

357
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:19,236
with a public relations
event, sort of, in a way.

358
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:20,396
Five seconds.

359
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:21,769
How do I look?

360
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,432
You look amazing.

361
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,737
I got to run.

362
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,742
Stick around, all right?

363
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,176
Okay. You're too sweet.
I mean that.

364
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,285
It went very well.

365
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:37,880
He said to wait here,
and I don't know why.

366
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,857
Y'all take five.

367
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:44,828
What's happening?

368
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,829
Check this out.

369
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,593
I don't know if y'all
been tracking it,

370
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,567
but a lot of people
been coming down on the Doctor

371
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:51,933
for speaking his mind.

372
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:56,266
Folks like Senator Spinkle,

373
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:57,433
and the media.

374
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:02,212
And Mr. Ben Feld.

375
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,875
Guess who we got
in the audience tonight?

376
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:07,976
Who?

377
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,020
We got his little

378
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,079
goddamn daughter,
Marci Feld is here.

379
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:12,521
Kick her ass!

380
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,525
Kill her!

381
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,855
And she wants me...

382
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:16,895
- No.
...to apologize...

383
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:19,122
Hell, no!

384
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:23,828
...and do some
public relation shit.

385
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,907
She wants me to change
who I am.

386
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,702
No!

387
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:32,236
Say, bitch!

388
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:33,642
Oh, my God.

389
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,339
Bring your pasty white ass
out here.

390
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:36,346
You get out there.

391
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,610
You tell him you are not
a bitch. Not always.

392
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,653
That's your answer
right there.

393
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:47,714
I'm a real nigger.

394
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,124
I don't change for no one.

395
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,320
I ain't changing shit.

396
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,327
Can I get an amen?

397
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,421
Amen!

398
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,796
You're out
of your element, baby.

399
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,232
You're out of your league.

400
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,064
And you're out
of your goddamn mind.

401
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,104
This is Harlem.

402
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,763
Get the hell out of my ghetto.

403
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,807
'Cause these people
ain't feeling you.

404
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,342
You know why?

405
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,001
'Cause you're not real.

406
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,045
You're unreal.

407
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,773
You're where real goes to die.

408
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,145
What do you mean I'm not real?

409
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,148
Authentic.

410
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,684
Talking about down.

411
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,310
Real is who you are.

412
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,321
And it's what you ain't.

413
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,357
Kill that bitch!

414
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,552
Shoot that bitch!

415
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,501
Whack, whack, whack,

416
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,195
whack, whack, whack, whack,

417
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,170
whack, whack, whack, whack...

418
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:34,830
Whack, whack...

419
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:35,896
Lauren.

420
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,008
I'm sorry.

421
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,303
...whack, whack...

422
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:39,435
Okay, okay!

423
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:44,312
If I can get real,
whatever the hell that means,

424
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,112
will you show up
tomorrow morning?

425
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,277
And how you going to get real?

426
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,115
What you going to do?
You going to rap for us?

427
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,880
No, I can't rap.

428
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,618
You can't rap?
Then I can't go. Bye.

429
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,624
Bye-bye.

430
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,251
All right, all right.

431
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,819
If I do rap,
do I have your word?

432
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,922
Word to your mother.

433
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,660
But you're going
to need a little beat.

434
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:03,792
Hold on.

435
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,063
What do you mean, a beat?

436
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:08,732
You can't rhyme if you
don't have no rhythm.

437
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,940
Hi, hi, hey, hey

438
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,315
Everybody have a nice day...

439
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,423
All right!

440
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:27,515
Okay.

441
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:28,890
It's okay.

442
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,589
Maybe she needs some bass.
Give her some bass.

443
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:32,925
Yeah, I need bass.

444
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:35,694
Give her some S! Yes!

445
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:36,961
Okay...

446
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,969
Hi, hi, I'm so real

447
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:41,198
Let me tell you how I feel...

448
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,377
God, this is so embarrassing.

449
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:48,378
She's so white.

450
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:49,379
I can't watch.

451
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,678
We know how you feel.

452
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,877
And I know what
you want to feel.

453
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:54,941
Oh!

454
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:00,550
But he's mine, bitch.

455
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,661
Okay, just give me another beat.

456
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,221
We're running out of beats.

457
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,857
Give her another one.
Go on.

458
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,198
Okay.

459
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,171
Now listen, I know
I suck at this, okay?

460
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,230
But it's my very, very
first time.

461
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,037
And I'm just not very musical.

462
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,873
Although I did love Lion King.

463
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:20,877
All right, so, but rapping.

464
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:21,878
Let me just think

465
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,245
for a minute, okay?

466
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:26,216
So, okay, so rapping,
it's about being...

467
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,377
about being honest...

468
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,215
"real," right?

469
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,222
Okay.

470
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,588
So, okay, okay, okay.

471
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,957
I would really like to talk
to all the women

472
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,052
in the audience...

473
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,391
in the house.

474
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,256
As you say.

475
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,823
Give me what you gave him.

476
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:49,063
Okay.

477
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,267
Mar-say!

478
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,434
Girlfriend.

479
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,772
Get down.

480
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:54,971
He says he's got the power

481
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,844
Somewhere in his pants

482
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,110
He says that I'm not real

483
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:01,675
That I don't stand a chance

484
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:04,347
Okay, I'm white, I'm blonde,
I'm Jewish

485
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,721
Could it get any worse?

486
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,419
But I have got a secret

487
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,085
The power in my purse

488
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,368
When I was very little,
my mom said to me

489
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,927
A man's just a man,
nothing comes free

490
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:21,767
Well, who can I trust
in this universe?

491
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,206
She said you trust the power,
the power in your purse

492
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:27,336
We've got the power

493
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:28,936
This one's Chanel

494
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,106
We've got the power

495
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,208
Mm, new purse smell

496
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,344
We've got the power

497
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,547
Yes, it's all right here

498
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,556
We've got the power

499
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,785
Come on, dawgs, get it in gear.

500
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,657
You tell it, girl!

501
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,356
Go on!

502
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,864
It's au courant,
just what you want

503
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,764
Hermes, Versace,
Saint Laurent

504
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,735
Please give me more

505
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,703
And Gucci, Pucci, Miss Dior

506
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,535
Louis Vuitton
just gets me gone

507
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:57,939
Ferra, Dolce, turn me on

508
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,170
Halston, Calvin, hip hooray

509
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,042
Herve Leger and Gaultier

510
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,843
Give me Ralph or give me Donna

511
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,906
Valentino, yes, I wanna

512
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,679
Lagerfeld, and in all candor

513
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,914

Badgley Mischka,

00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,929
Can I keep going?
Yes, I can

00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:19,930
De la Renta and Kamali

519
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,659
Lecroix, Bill Blass,
bravo, Cavalli!

520
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,894
Betsey Johnson, Anna Sui

521
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,834
I see me in a Givenchy

522
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,872
Von Furstenburg and Perry Ellis

523
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:30,271
Please, Mark Jacobs,
don't be jealous

524
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,606
I love them all,
it's like a curse

525
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,042
It's fashion power in my purse

526
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,046
She's got the power

527
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:38,344
Oh! I love this thing

528
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,112
She's got the power

529
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,914
Everyone, sing, sing, sing

530
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,921
She's got the power

531
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,253
God, what it stores

532
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,791
She's got the power

533
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,690
So come on now, what's in yours?

534
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,956

Thank you, Jesus
Thank you, Jesus

543
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:15,284
For my heavenly purse...

544
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:22,186
Me?

545
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:25,028
Okay, all right.

546
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:32,403
And I am telling you

547
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:36,100
I'm not going-ah...

548
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:37,471
That's all I know.

549
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,411
We've got the power

550
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:44,642
We cannot lose

551
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,513
We've got the power

552
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,553
Look, it matches our shoes

553
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,951
We've got the power

554
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:51,750
Come on, everyone dance

555
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,154
We've got the power

556
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,590
See, we don't need pants

557
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,354
Power

558
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:57,759
- Yeah
- Power

559
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,456
Power

560
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:02,659
Power, we've got the power

561
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,133
Power, Power

562
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:05,829
Power

563
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:08,998
Power, we've got the power

564
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:12,271
Power, Power

565
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,437
Power, we've got the power!

566
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,881
You my goddamn lawyer,
just get me out of here.

567
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,647
Dr. S is joining
a public service campaign

568
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,313
to promote sexual abstinence.

569
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:27,358
Still, Feldco stock
continues to plummet.

570
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,553
Yo, Tubby!

571
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,526
Go, mama.

572
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,658
Did you hear about that Marci?

573
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,635
How could you let
that happen to me?

574
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,898
Baby, I'm in the joint, boo.

575
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,573
Tubby, you and I have a deal.

576
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:50,843
You promised me total
personal management.

577
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:53,248
That is why I signed
with your label.

578
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,718
You gave me
your word on Dr. S.

579
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,846
You said that we could be
a power couple.

580
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,756
It's under control.

581
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:02,986
I know we got to do something
about that bitch.

582
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,824
When, Tubby?

583
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,126
I'm on it.
I'll let you know, baby.

584
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,329
But he'll be here any second.

585
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,494
He gave me his word.

586
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,902
He's already cost us
over two hours.

587
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,336
You know, he's on his way.

588
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,534
He's in the car.
His people called.

589
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,008
Yo.

590
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,066
Oh, Dr. S.

591
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,737
I told you.

592
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,144
Oh, you look great.

593
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:25,205
Doctor, this is
your director, Todd.

594
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,547
Okay, what is this shit?

595
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:30,281
Well, we're making
a public service spot

596
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:32,823
sponsored by the Save
Our Families Foundation

597
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:35,018
and you are going to
be its spokesperson.

598
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,253
Isn't that the best?

599
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:38,455
Hold on, spokesperson for what?

600
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,293
Yes.

601
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:42,265
Let me introduce you
to your costars.

602
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,359
This is so major.

603
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,098
Just last week they sold
over 12 million copies

604
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:48,605
of their new CD.

605
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:51,073
What are you doing?

606
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:52,871
Look, they are huge.

607
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:53,933
This way.

608
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,341
Parents love them

609
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,846
because they are
non-threatening.

610
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,644
Now if you appear with them,

611
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,878
people will see that
you're not so, you know,

612
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,318
filthy and evil and disgusting.

613
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:04,616
Not that those are bad things.

614
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:05,781
You know, last night,

615
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,722
I thought you were just
some crazy-ass bitch.

616
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,522
Now I have three little words
to say.

617
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:12,495
"Thank you, Marci"?

618
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,088
"Bye, bye, bye."

619
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:17,134
If you don't do this,
I will call Feldco

620
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:21,400
and we will stop
shipping your CDs today.

621
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,270
And you will be dead meat.

622
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:28,108
Which also describes abstinence.

623
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,204
Okay, what do I got to do?

624
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:32,909
Come on, the press
will be here soon.

625
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:36,010
We've got all the magazines
and the papers.

626
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,816
Don't you love this?

627
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:40,483
Oh, it reminds me of
my playhouse when I was little.

628
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:41,923
Did you have a playhouse?

629
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,891
- I did. - I did.
- I did. - I did.

630
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:45,930
Okay. Dr. S, this is Mikey,

631
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:48,589
Jonathan, Adam and Kelly.

632
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,259
Dr. S, may I present
Boyz R Us.

633
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,200
- What up?
- Props to the Doctor.

634
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,932
Okay, why don't we
run through the song

635
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,702
so Dr. S can see what it is
he'll be doing with you.

636
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,767
Okay.

637
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:00,674
Watch it. Here.

638
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:01,871
Bell, please.

639
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:04,982
Okay, this will be
a full rehearsal

640
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,381
with cameras and everything.

641
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:07,850
- You want to sit? No.
- Can I get some lights, please?

642
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,616
And... action!

643
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,714
"A" mark.

644
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,986
Sexual abstinence spot,
take one.

645
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,360
Hold on... Hold on

646
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,729
Let's wait... Let's wait

647
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,702
Let's hold hands in the sunset

648
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:26,896
Let's date

649
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:29,872
What I feel for you is special

650
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:32,136
So let's not spoil it

651
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,644
Our bodies are a temple

652
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,079
Not a public toilet

653
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:39,446
Take care... Take care

654
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:42,077
Say whoa... Say whoa

655
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:44,621
If you see me coming

656
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:47,180
Girl, it's time to go

657
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:49,920
Let's be patient
till our wedding day

658
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,428
Till God tells us that it's okay

659
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:55,022
Till then,
let's stay six feet away

660
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,034
Girl, shut that gate

661
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:59,764
Hold off... Hold off

662
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,170
Hold off,
Hold off

663
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,867
Let's wait

664
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:07,469
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

665
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:11,675
Let's wait.

666
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:14,782
Cut!

667
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:15,820
- Love of God.
- Perfect!

668
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,548
- Wonderful! - Beautiful!
- Wasn't that something?

669
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:19,556
Guys, that was really nice.

670
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:21,148
Can you get through?

671
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,887
Yeah, that was something.

672
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,619
Bravo.

673
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,254
Honestly.

674
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:27,821
And you're going
to introduce them.

675
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,059
Isn't that inspiring?

676
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,227
We have a responsibility
to our fans.

677
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:32,326
Yeah, we get so many
beautiful letters

678
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:33,233
from these sweet
little girls.

679
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:34,236
And their families.

680
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,603
And college-educated older men.

681
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,235
Dr. S?

682
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,743
Okay, I'm there.

683
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:43,076
But first, I'm gonna need
somewhere private to rehearse.

684
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:44,206
Of course.

685
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,408
With my dawgs.

686
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:52,917
Bell, please.

687
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,922
Okay.

688
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:55,925
You see?
I told you he'd be into this.

689
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:57,824
He's gonna make America say,

690
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,091
"Hey, let's give this guy
another chance."

691
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,462
- We're lucky to have him.
- Yeah.

692
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,465
"A" mark.

693
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:03,899
Sexual abstinence spot,
take two.

694
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,027
And action!

695
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:08,231
Hey, kids.

696
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,603
Gather 'round.

697
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,335
It's me, Dr. S.

698
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:14,401
And I know,
especially when you're young,

699
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,937
this world can be
a very complicated place.

700
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:20,414
So I want you to listen up

701
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,077
to some good pals of mine

702
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:26,783
'cause they got a very important
message for today's teens.

703
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:32,591
Hey, guy... Hey, guy

704
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,665
Let's date... Let's date

705
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,064
Let's date... Let's date

706
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:38,660
'Cause we're both
something special

707
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:40,363
Not straight

708
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:43,202
What I feel for you
is groovy

709
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,640
So let's enjoy it

710
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,178
I think your sister's pretty

711
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,373
But let's boy and boy it

712
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:52,643
I saw... I saw

713
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:54,708
You wink... You wink

714
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:57,983
And life is so much better

715
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,216
Now that we're in sync

716
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:01,189
Ah...

717
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,352
I really like
your smiling face

718
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:05,726
My beach house has a fireplace

719
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:08,357
We'll watch reruns
of Will and Grace

720
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,492
Let's fornicate

721
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:13,059
Hold on... Hold on

722
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:15,571
Hold tight... Hold tight

723
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,200
Let's date,
let's date, let's date

724
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,710
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

725
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:24,578
Let's date.

726
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,013
- That was so good.
- Wasn't it?

727
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:36,621
Now please keep in mind
this is your last chance

728
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:38,059
to clean up your act.

729
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:40,723
You're lucky I thought
of bringing you tonight.

730
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,734
This party is such a fabulous
idea for our campaign.

731
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:46,895
Now people will see
that you're really decent

732
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,438
and helpful and nice.

733
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,201
Nice, my ass.

734
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:53,438
When you gonna wake up
and smell the brother?

735
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:57,641
What is that, rabbit?

736
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:01,173
Siberian chinchilla, 300 Gs.

737
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,083
What's that you got on?

738
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:04,781
Lab rat?

739
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:07,290
This is classic white mink.

740
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,088
Is that platinum?

741
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,630
Yes, ghetto fabulous.

742
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,529
What about your earrings,
those real diamonds?

743
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,591
- Of course.
- Wow.

744
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:20,035
I didn't know they made them
that small.

745
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,600
You know, you remind me
of someone in that outfit

746
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,041
with the jewelry and the hair.

747
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,577
Yeah, who?

748
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:30,944
Biggie? Tupac? DMX?

749
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,279
My Aunt Esther.

750
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:39,914
Welcome.

751
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:41,959
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,

752
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:45,518
to our annual auction
to benefit CWNFITA,

753
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:48,895
Children With No Feeling
In Their Arms.

754
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,401
Okay.

755
00:32:54,472 --> 00:33:00,138
It is a terrible illness still
affecting far too many wee ones.

756
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:01,405
Wee ones?

757
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,411
It's tragic.

758
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,277
They can't dial.

759
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:26,503
Ouch! Stop it!

760
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,035
Marvelous.

761
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:35,945
Thank you.

762
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,945
That's great.
All right.

763
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:43,544
Our first item is something
truly, deeply exciting.

764
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:46,181
It's dinner for two
with the handsome,

765
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:50,694
the totally dreamy
Mr. Donald Trump.

766
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,194
I love Donald.

767
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:54,196
She can't be real.

768
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:55,960
Who wants dinner
with Donald Trump?

769
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,967
You don't have to touch him.

770
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:01,037
Maybe he's changed.

771
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:02,538
That's his real hair.

772
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,472
- This is whack.
- Whack?

773
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,533
Oh, that means "bad."

774
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:09,375
I do volunteer work,
teaching black teenagers

775
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,210
to wear the correct size.

776
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:13,512
I'll be back. Excuse me.

777
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:18,987
Is that Chuck Berry?

778
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:28,762
Wow.

779
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:29,891
What is he doing?

780
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,093
You need some help, baby.

781
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,636
I'm here to back you up.

782
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,933
I'm... I'm working, okay?

783
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,301
Just go back to your seat.

784
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:37,363
It's okay.

785
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:39,603
We're working together
as a team.

786
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:41,645
They're old.
They don't have much time left.

787
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:42,872
Look,

788
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:43,936
shout out to the wee one.

789
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:44,946
Throw your hands up.

790
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,607
Stop it.

791
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:47,776
Hey.

792
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:51,618
We got to get these
wee ones some arms.

793
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:53,350
My first item up,

794
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:56,723
I need to talk
to just the ladies.

795
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,159
Fellas, take five.

796
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,395
He is so sexy.

797
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:03,491
He's a gangsta.

798
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:06,128
He raps about guns
and bitches and hos.

799
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:08,229
That's what I said.

800
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:15,510
'Cause I know you ladies all
beautiful and bangin' and alone.

801
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,343
Are you alone, mama?

802
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:19,576
I'm with my husband.

803
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,379
Yeah, you're alone.

804
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,919
Bam.

805
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,612
And you're all here

806
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:27,590
with your husbands
and your ex-husbands

807
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:31,219
and future ex-husbands,
but you're all alone.

808
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:34,264
I see it in your eyes.

809
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:35,890
Who's dis?

810
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,400
He's my fourth husband.

811
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,436
Your fourth husband.

812
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:40,596
Is he rich?

813
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:42,229
Not rich enough.

814
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,235
Then you're still alone.

815
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,244
And what do we have here?

816
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:51,873
Look at these lovely creatures
over here.

817
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:53,109
Hi, ladies.

818
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:55,152
Tell me the truth,
y'all ever get it on?

819
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:59,246
One bed, four bitches?
Be honest.

820
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:02,826
I'm telling you,

821
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,863
this room is just full
of lush, Ionely,

822
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,989
lovely

823
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:09,032
ladies.

824
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,590
Hey!

825
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,693
Don't touch.

826
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,603
Now, who's wearing that perfume

827
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:19,109
that got me all worked up,
turned on, turned out, huh?

828
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,542
- Me. - Me.
- Me.

829
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:21,703
Hey, hey,

830
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:25,112
now, now, don't fight,
delight.

831
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,912
That's right, ladies,

832
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:30,715
because you all deserve
something mo' better,

833
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:33,723
mo' blacker, mo' me.

834
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,518
Late at night you
want something hot

835
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:41,258
and homey.

836
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:44,358
You're not homey.

837
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:49,429
So, right now,
I'm offerin' a house call

838
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:51,634
from the doctor of love.

839

$20,000.

841

Ladies... it's for the wee ones.

842
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,346
They can't touch themself
no place.

843
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,888
Do I hear 30 Gs?

844
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:05,978

00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:28,277
All right.

854
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,041
Thank you.

855
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,485
I'm so embarrassed.

856
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:38,544
Oh, stop it.

857
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:39,555
You made the bid.

858
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:40,556
He's got you.

859
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:41,557
That's true.

860
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:42,558
He's the man.

861
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:43,559
He's a player.

862
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:44,595
We're his bitches.

863
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,231
Yo, Yolanda, I just got word
they headed for the club.

864
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:52,360
Get over there.

865
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,425
Tubby?

866
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:54,436
What?

867
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:55,472
On the way, boo.

868
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:09,978
What is this place?

869
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:12,045
This is my club.
My hang.

870
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,647
Do you own it?

871
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,885
Damn right.
And I will open up

872
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:18,825
branches in L.A.,
Atlanta, and Miami.

873
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:21,490
Plus a hotel and casino
in Vegas.

874
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:22,827
He's a mogul.

875
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,889
Like your father.

876
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,002
Very nice.

877
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,127
Stop it.

878
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:28,000
Yo, S!

879
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:31,900
Ladies, may I present

880
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:36,036
to you T-Bill, Freekazoid
and Quantrelle.

881
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:39,276
They all have such funny names.

882
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,147
Kirsten Blatt.

883
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:42,549
Caitlin Mellowitz.

884
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,848
Lauren Farb.

885
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,821
Hey, baby.

886
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:58,030
You know,
I did make the winning bid

887
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:59,865
at the auction for a house call.
