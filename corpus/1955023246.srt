1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,200
(Calming music)

2
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:34,200
* So come with me,
we'll all go and see

3
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,867
* The Big Rock Candy Mountains

4
00:00:37,867 --> 00:00:41,833
* Yes, the Big Rock
Candy Mountains

5
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:45,733
* There's a land
that's fair and bright

6
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:49,367
* Where the handouts
grow on bushes

7
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:52,833
* And you sleep
out every night *

8
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:57,733
(Phone ringing)

9
00:01:10,467 --> 00:01:11,833
Hello?

10
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:13,767
[Voiceover] Where
have you been?

11
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:18,067
Oh just, just had to work
on the will, what's up?

12
00:01:18,067 --> 00:01:19,967
[Voiceover] What's up,
our little brother is

13
00:01:19,967 --> 00:01:21,333
Still missing.

14
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:23,533
Well I mean you
left him there.

15
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:27,633
[Voiceover] I'm not
making any of this up.

16
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:29,533
Oh God, why won't
you believe me?

17
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:31,467
Well, they're
saying it's a virus.

18
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:33,733
You sure you and Sam
didn't just hallucinate

19
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:35,400
All this ghost stuff
when you were there?

20
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,867
[Voiceover] So,
what, did I hallucinate

21
00:01:37,867 --> 00:01:41,267
My broken leg and the
claw marks on my back too?

22
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,500
No come, that's not
what I'm saying, okay,

23
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,133
I'm just saying that
sounds an awful lot

24
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:48,167
Like Sam's big imagination
going into overdrive here.

25
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:49,500
[Voiceover] Because
having an imagination

26
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,300
Is just such a
terrible thing, Dad.

27
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,800
All right come on,
look, after all this shit

28
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,133
I've been going
through, with the will,

29
00:01:57,133 --> 00:02:00,067
You really think that I
still regret Dad's death?

30
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:02,367
The only thing I regret
about our parents dying

31
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:03,900
Is that I didn't get to
tell Dad to go F himself

32
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,500
Before he died.

33
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,767
Okay now, I will go to
Tasmania and I will bring

34
00:02:07,767 --> 00:02:10,367
Our little brother
home, you understand me?

35
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:11,567
[Voiceover] Fine.

36
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:13,067
Just bring him home.

37
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:13,967
Fine.

38
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,967
(Anticipating music)

39
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:24,067
[Voiceover] Why isn't the
government talking about it?

40
00:02:24,067 --> 00:02:26,233
We know Tasmania is
quarantined, sure but,

41
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:27,633
What is being quarantined?

42
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:29,300
What if it is all
just a cover up?

43
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,667
Or worse, what if we're
dealing with something

44
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:34,167
The military doesn't
even understand?

45
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:36,767
[Voiceover] Oh come on,
the entire state of Tasmania

46
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:39,467
Evacuated for what, testing?

47
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:41,067
People have died.

48
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:42,467
(Sad music)

49
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:44,767
[Voiceover] Nah but,
people have gone missing.

50
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:46,367
Have you seen any
bodies, I don't know.

51
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:48,267
Now maybe they found
something, I'm telling you,

52
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:51,100
Maybe we're dealing with an
enemy here that can't be seen.

53
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,233
(Sad music)

54
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,067
[Voiceover] You see,
this is exactly the sort of

55
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:09,933
Conspiracy that brought
these people to doing

56
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:11,967
Wretched and horrible things.

57
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:14,633
It's this nonsense
that gets people killed

58
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:16,233
On a grand scale.

59
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:20,067
[Voiceover] Tell
the (mumbling), it's
been (mumbling),

60
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:24,967
Like days, and we haven't
heard a thing, (mumbling).

61
00:03:24,967 --> 00:03:29,667
(Sad music)

62
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:45,367
An entire state is empty.

63
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:47,800
When is someone gonna
tell us the truth?

64
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,300
[Voiceover] And
what is the truth?

65
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,900
Aliens, secret testing?

66
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,767
[Voiceover] See that's just
it, it could be anything.

67
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:59,133
(Sad music)

68
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,167
There's a lot of people like
you, turning the other way,

69
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,433
And pretend like
nothing is happening,

70
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:12,533
That nothing is
wrong, (mumbling)

71
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:16,633
May be on a path to extinction
if this is left unchecked.

72
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:18,600
[Voiceover]
Extinction, please.

73
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,567
The military says
there's a virus,

74
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:22,067
And they're containing it.

75
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:25,867
That is enough for me, I'm
well, my family is well,

76
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:27,767
I have no interest in digging
up something that could

77
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,967
Cost me or any other fellow
Australians their lives.

78
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:33,767
I say this is the military's
problem, let the military

79
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:35,167
Handle it, okay?

80
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:53,567
(Sad music)

81
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,767
[Voiceover] Hey
Sam, It's Molly.

82
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,167
My friend and I are here,
we're at your cabin.

83
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,933
It doesn't look like
you've been here for weeks.

84
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:18,833
Oh God where are you?

85
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:22,100
Look, I'm sorry to
just show up like this,

86
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,900
But I really need
you to come home,

87
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,133
So we can figure everything out.

88
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:29,467
I understand why you've
run away from all this

89
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:32,267
And I'm really trying
to support you,

90
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:35,067
But if the three of
us just finished this,

91
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:37,733
Then we can all finally
move on with our lives.

92
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:42,200
Anyway, please call me
back when you get this.

93
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,133
I love you Sam.

94
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,433
(Foreboding music)

95
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:01,900
(Coins rattling)

96
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,333
(Phone line beeping)

97
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:17,700
(Phone line beeping)

98
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:12,500
(Ominous music)

99
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,467
[Voiceover] Did you get
a hold of Brian today?

100
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:50,067
Is he gonna meet you out
here if you can't find Sam?

101
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:51,133
No.

102
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,067
I don't know where he is.

103
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,700
But Brian, he just
doesn't even care.

104
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,233
He used to be the
sweetest guy ever.

105
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:02,933
Like he would cry if
someone killed a bird.

106
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,067
Oh my God, he has just
become such an asshole.

107
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:08,767
I can't even remember
the last time he said,

108
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:10,067
"I love you."

109
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,867
What the hell is that?

110
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:15,067
[Voiceover] I don't know.

111
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:18,500
(Screeching)

112
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,667
Molly, we need to go!

113
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:23,700
We need to get
back to the cabin.

114
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,967
(Ominous music)

115
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:37,200
(Wind gushing)
(rumbling)

116
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:57,067
(Rattling)

117
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:05,633
(Hissing)

118
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:10,600
[Voiceover] Sam,
where are you Sam?

119
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:14,800
Where are you?

120
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:19,567
(Door opening)

121
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,467
(Door slamming shut)

122
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:27,433
(Wind gushing)
(ominous music)

123
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,200
(Foreboding music)

124
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:57,467
[Voiceover] The
news calls it a virus.

125
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,167
But Sam explains it differently.

126
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:11,167
January 24th, I received
a package from Sam

127
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:13,733
Two weeks ago,
asking me to return

128
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:15,867
To our family's
old vacation spot.

129
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,767
This is a message in a bottle
for humanity, he calls it.

130
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:28,367
(Spray can hissing)

131
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:35,733
Now first things first.

132
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:37,300
If you going out
into their territory

133
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,533
You have to make yourself
invisible to them.

134
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,167
Ash from the dead
conceals your presence

135
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:50,067
When they are near, never
leave home without it.

136
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:55,900
Surround the
perimeter of wherever

137
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,800
You may camp with
the ash as well,

138
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,533
It helps throw off your scent.

139
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,067
And make sure not to
stay at any spot longer

140
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:06,433
Than a night or two.

141
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:08,967
If you're ever unsure
of their presence,

142
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:10,600
Remember that they
communicate with one another

143
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,800
Using some sort of radio wave.

144
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,767
You can pick up their chatter
using a low-frequency radio.

145
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:17,467
But very rarely
will you actually

146
00:12:17,467 --> 00:12:19,800
Hear them, and more
commonly you'll pick up

147
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,700
Ghost radio waves,
this will let you know

148
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,867
You're in the clear.

149
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:28,267
(Swing music)

150
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:31,267
And if your radio should
fail you for any reason,

151
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:33,167
There is one other step
you can take to observe

152
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:34,467
Their presence.

153
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:38,300
Any camera with infrared
can pick them up,

154
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,767
They seem to be formed of light

155
00:12:39,767 --> 00:12:41,367
That the naked eye can't see,

156
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:43,167
Some type of energy.

157
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:45,867
They don't seem to have
a physical presence.

158
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:48,633
But perhaps almost a
form of light radiation,

159
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:50,367
Or a soul.

160
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:53,467
If you're here in
Tasmania, you are in

161
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:55,133
Enemy territory.

162
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:56,967
Never let your guard down.

163
00:12:57,933 --> 00:12:59,167
The frequency of
them seems to depend

164
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:01,567
On how many people
have died in the area,

165
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,367
And don't confuse this with
where people are buried,

166
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,400
Graveyards actually
seem to be safe houses,

167
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:10,100
And in closing, (mumbling),

168
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,067
Keep your use of
electricity to a minimum,

169
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:15,133
As it seems to attract
or even spawn them.

170
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:16,833
They seem to feed off of it.

171
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,700
He didn't seem sure
who would receive

172
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,333
This message, but, for
some reason it found me.

173
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,300
(Swing music)

174
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:34,700
Is what he says true?

175
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:40,067
He claimed he'd keep
moving and survive

176
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:42,667
For as long as he could
until he was rescued.

177
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,800
Do I still have
time to find him?

178
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:08,133
(Foreboding music)

179
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:11,067
(Fly buzzing)

180
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,133
(Radio static buzzing)

181
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:46,867
(Swing music)

182
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:54,567
* I met a girl the other night

183
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:56,967
* In fact she was divine

184
00:14:56,967 --> 00:14:59,233
* She lived out in the country

185
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,733
* Three miles from
the river line

186
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:03,900
* I called to see
her the other night

187
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,433
* Stayed late, I missed my train

188
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:08,133
* Her Pa discovers me

189
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:11,233
* And throws me
right out in the rain

190
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:14,067
* I got right up and walked
and walked and walked

191
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:16,067
* And walked and walked

192
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:17,933
* I did not have her number

193
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:20,733
* Or else I would
not have had hope

194
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:23,067
* Put down my head and in my bed

195
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:25,467
* Put all my hope
throughout my test

196
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,733
* And got right up
and walked along

197
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:30,133
* And walked, and
walked and walked *

198
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:15,067
(Radio static buzzing)

199
00:16:16,467 --> 00:16:21,100
(Television static buzzing)

200
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,633
* See that girl was by my side

201
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:42,067
* Least I now know, (mumbling)

202
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,400
* And I ain't say
call all over us

203
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,733
* My girl jumped in the air

204
00:16:46,733 --> 00:16:48,133
* She sits on the rooftop

205
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:52,600
(Foreboding music)

206
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:02,067
(Radio buzzing)

207
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:03,233
[Voiceover] Good
evening everybody,

208
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:05,733
Tonight's guest is Sam Everett,

209
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,700
A poor unfortunate soul
searching for his parents

210
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,367
Even though they're
already dead.

211
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:14,400
But then what are
you gonna find?

212
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,633
What brings (mumbling),

213
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:17,067
You're not looking in
the right places, buddy.

214
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:18,500
We're halfway
outside your house

215
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,067
At this very moment, waiting
to give you a big hug!

216
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:23,600
We don't bite Sam,

217
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,233
Now throw that crown upside down

218
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:26,967
And let us in buddy!

219
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:30,600
(Radio static buzzing)

220
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,567
(Calming music)

221
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:38,167
* I've traveled east,
I've traveled west

222
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:40,700
* I've been in every state

223
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,067
* A member of the
knights of rest

224
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:45,400
* With dues paid up to date

225
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,700
* There's just two
things that I despise

226
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,067
* Two things I always shirk

227
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:52,200
* The first thing
is a cake of soap

228
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,433
* The other one is work

229
00:17:54,433 --> 00:17:56,733
* My life to me is just as free

230
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:58,933
* I'm always on a lark

231
00:17:58,933 --> 00:18:01,067
* Somebody said
you're just a bum

232
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:03,400
* And I don't like that remark

233
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,700
* Who said I was a Bum

234
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,833
* Who said I was a Bum

235
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,067
* I haven't worked for 20 years

236
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:12,133
* I guess I'm not so dumb

237
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,233
* And as a tramp along the road

238
00:18:14,233 --> 00:18:16,533
* The people hear me hum

239
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:18,500
* I know I'm a hobo

240
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,100
* But who said I was a bum

241
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,100
* I must admit

242
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,400
* I never fit in any job and say

243
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,433
* Whenever I see a pile of wood

244
00:18:27,433 --> 00:18:29,700
* I look the other way

245
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,767
* I haven't shaved
in many a year

246
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:33,867
* I really am afraid

247
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:36,067
* Because I fear my wire beard

248
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:38,333
* Would break the razor blade

249
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,300
* The other day while on my way

250
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,433
* A cop gave me a chase

251
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:44,100
* I thought I heard him holler

252
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,700
* Take that mattress
off-a your face

253
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,733
* Who said I was a bum

254
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:50,833
* Who said I was a bum

255
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,867
* Of death and easy, go inside

256
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:55,067
* Of things that easy come

257
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,067
* A bum with
nickels, now and then

258
00:18:57,067 --> 00:18:59,167
* They keep me full of rum

259
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:01,067
* I know I'm a hobo

260
00:19:01,067 --> 00:19:03,900
* But who said I was a bum

261
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,500
* My coat is worn,
my shoes are torn

262
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,767
* There's holes in both my toes

263
00:19:10,767 --> 00:19:12,067
* And what is worse

264
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,900
* I always nurse a
blossom on my nose

265
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,167
* And with a glance

266
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:19,067
* You'll see my pants
are baggy at the knees

267
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:20,233
* They're worn so thin

268
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:22,067
* I feel the wind
blow through my BVDs

269
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:23,567
(Wind gushing)

270
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:25,233
* But there ain't
nothing that worries me

271
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:27,233
* Now what is that about

272
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,233
* There's never
something on my mind

273
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:31,300
* Except a dirty hat

274
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,200
* But who said I was a bum

275
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
* Who said I was a bum

276
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
* Don't think I'm a lonesome guy

277
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,333
* Because I look so glum

278
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,333
* I've got a lot
of cootie friends

279
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,500
* That keep me on the hum

280
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,367
* I know I'm a hobo

281
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:47,667
* But who said I was a bum

282
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:52,633
(Radio static buzzing)
(foreboding music)

283
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:54,467
(Screeching)

284
00:19:56,433 --> 00:19:57,967
[Voiceover] Come back Sam.

285
00:19:57,967 --> 00:20:00,800
You can't hide from me.

286
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,767
You can't hide from me, Sam.

287
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:05,300
Where are you going?

288
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:08,900
* I know I'm a hobo

289
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,933
* But who said I

290
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:14,533
(Radio static buzzing)

291
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,333
[Voiceover] January 25th.

292
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,700
I only have two weeks
left until the boat

293
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,500
I hired comes back for me.

294
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,267
And if I don't make
it back in time,

295
00:20:28,267 --> 00:20:29,567
He will leave without us.

296
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:33,733
(Ominous music)

297
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,000
Sam is here somewhere.

298
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,933
And I know for sure now.

299
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,867
I've picked up some
sort of trail of his,

300
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:03,100
But, where does it lead?

301
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:30,500
Whatever happened
here has somehow

302
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,367
Made the electricity come alive.

303
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:38,633
It seems to react to a
person's presence at will.

304
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:43,867
Or is this just the virus?

305
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:12,800
Keep hiding Sam, and stay safe.

306
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,200
I'm coming.

307
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:27,500
(Country music)

308
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,400
* Look up, look down

309
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,200
* That railroad line

310
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,533
* And bow your head and cry

311
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,433
* The longest train

312
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:44,067
* I ever saw

313
00:22:44,067 --> 00:22:48,467
* Was 80 coaches long

314
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,767
* The engine passed

315
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:54,300
* At eight o'clock

316
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:58,400
* And the cab went by at nine

317
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:01,800
* Look up, look down

318
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,233
* That railroad line

319
00:23:04,233 --> 00:23:08,800
* And bow your head and cry

320
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,700
(Humming)

321
00:23:18,767 --> 00:23:21,100
* Little girl, little girl

322
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,433
* Don't you tell me no lies

323
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:27,433
* Where did you stay last night

324
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,400
* I stayed in jail

325
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,633
* 99 days

326
00:23:32,633 --> 00:23:37,067
* With my face
turned to the wall

327
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:42,067
(Humming)

328
00:23:46,233 --> 00:23:48,500
* Little girl little girl

329
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,733
* What have I done

330
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:54,367
* You turned your back on me

331
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,533
* Take all my clothes

332
00:23:57,533 --> 00:23:59,467
* Throw them all outdoors

333
00:23:59,467 --> 00:24:00,600
* Farewell

334
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,800
[Voiceover] Help me!

335
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,933
Please.

336
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,067
This way Sam.

337
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,300
Hurry Sam.

338
00:24:08,933 --> 00:24:11,067
(Rumbling)

339
00:24:11,067 --> 00:24:12,433
[Voiceover] I've got you Sam,

340
00:24:12,433 --> 00:24:16,667
You little brat,
there is no escape.

341
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,700
It's no use Sam.

342
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,433
Sam you can't hide from me.

343
00:24:23,433 --> 00:24:28,167
(Rumbling)
(ominous music)

344
00:24:36,633 --> 00:24:40,833
(Screeching)

345
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:43,500
I'm going to stop you Sam.

346
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:46,200
I know you're here.

347
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,200
(Rattling)

348
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:56,233
(Distorted screeching speech)

349
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,667
(Foreboding music)

350
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,433
[Voiceover] January 26th.

351
00:25:30,633 --> 00:25:32,500
He began to stay
closer to the sea,

352
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,433
Away from civilization,
as he attempted

353
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:36,200
To figure out what
they actually were.

354
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,167
His research is
hard to understand,

355
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:52,567
He goes on and on
about several things,

356
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:54,467
Such as
inter-dimensional beings,

357
00:25:54,467 --> 00:25:57,300
Shadow people, and even aliens.

358
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,800
He claimed that
legends and history

359
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,933
Seemed to blend, to intertwine,

360
00:26:00,933 --> 00:26:02,733
And even lose focus.

361
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,067
He believed that
ghosts were simply

362
00:26:06,067 --> 00:26:07,300
A generalization.

363
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:09,567
Or a misanalysis of that.

364
00:26:12,133 --> 00:26:13,433
And they would
prey on the energy

365
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:15,200
Of misfortune and suffering.

366
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,500
They can come to our side

367
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,733
Through some sort of portals.

368
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,533
He seemed to think
that there are

369
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:26,667
These portals, or hot spots,

370
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,367
All over the world,

371
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,200
Where the spirits
can come to our side.

372
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,100
Is Tasmania really
one of those places?

373
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,700
He concluded that these portals

374
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,300
Explained the areas of the world

375
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,200
Where the foulness and
suffering of humanity

376
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,767
Never seemed to clear.

377
00:26:56,233 --> 00:26:58,400
His final note was
merely a question.

378
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:04,267
"Will there always be a dark
cloud over these places?"

379
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,300
"Or can the portals be closed?"

380
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,367
"And can the light return?"

381
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,067
Where are you Sam?

382
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:23,267
(Radio static buzzing)

383
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:26,467
[Voiceover] The whole
fury and might of the enemy

384
00:27:26,467 --> 00:27:29,467
Must very soon be turned on us.

385
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,600
Hitler knows that he
will have to break us

386
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,267
In this island or lose the war.

387
00:27:36,267 --> 00:27:39,733
But if we fail, then
the whole world,

388
00:27:39,733 --> 00:27:42,500
Including the United States,

389
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:47,367
Including all that we
have known and cared for,

390
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:51,400
Will sink into the
abyss of a new dark age

391
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,800
Made more sinister...

392
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,067
So these are your
ghosts huh Sam?

393
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:59,333
(Radio static buzzing)

394
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:00,800
[Voiceover] It's me again.

395
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,667
I really need to talk to you.

396
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:06,600
We've always got through
stuff like this together.

397
00:28:07,533 --> 00:28:11,200
I just wanted to make sure
that you got mom's necklace.

398
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,733
I left it in your mailbox.

399
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:16,200
Now...

400
00:28:16,733 --> 00:28:20,200
She came to, to
see me last night.

401
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:21,933
I couldn't even look at her

402
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:23,567
For about 10 minutes.

403
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,533
But when I finally
did, she gave a message

404
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:29,233
For you and Brian.

405
00:28:29,767 --> 00:28:32,100
She wanted you to keep
her necklace close.

406
00:28:32,767 --> 00:28:35,200
Because you will need it.

407
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,067
It's gotta feel
good if this is you.

408
00:28:38,067 --> 00:28:40,167
(Mumbling), please babe.

409
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,833
It's such a long
time since I've seen

410
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:44,467
Anything like this.

411
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:47,133
Am I going crazy?

412
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,933
Or do you see that too?

413
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,233
Have you seen Mom and Dad
yet since they've died?

414
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:59,733
(Radio static buzzing)

415
00:29:01,733 --> 00:29:06,733
(Camera static buzzing)

416
00:29:12,067 --> 00:29:17,067
(Foreboding music)
(wind gushing)

417
00:29:40,433 --> 00:29:42,267
[Voiceover] You can't
hide from me, Brian.

418
00:29:42,267 --> 00:29:43,367
[Brian] Oh shit.

419
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,633
(Car engine revving)

420
00:29:48,633 --> 00:29:50,967
[Voiceover] You can't
run from me forever.

421
00:29:55,267 --> 00:29:59,467
(Foreboding music)

422
00:30:23,533 --> 00:30:27,867
(Rattling)

423
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:32,433
(Growling)

424
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,300
(Cheerful music)

425
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:21,200
* Oh I'm going down
that road feeling bad

426
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,867
* Oh I'm going down
that road feeling bad

427
00:31:24,867 --> 00:31:28,900
* Oh I'm going down
that road feeling bad

428
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,767
* And I ain't gonna
be treated this way

429
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,067
* Oh I'm going where that
chilly wind never blows

430
00:31:52,067 --> 00:31:55,900
* Oh I'm going where that
chilly wind never blows

431
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,800
* Oh I'm going where that
chilly wind never blows

432
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,533
* And I ain't gonna
be treated this way

433
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:22,800
* Oh way down in
jail on my knees

434
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,467
* Oh way down in
jail on my knees

435
00:32:26,467 --> 00:32:30,300
* Oh way down in
jail on my knees

436
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,367
* And I ain't gonna
be treated this way

437
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,700
* Oh feed me on
cornbread and peas *

438
00:32:56,467 --> 00:32:58,433
(Relaxing music)

439
00:32:58,433 --> 00:33:01,100
* One evening as
the sun went down

440
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,167
* And the jungle
fire was burning

441
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:07,233
* Down the track
came a hobo hiking

442
00:33:07,233 --> 00:33:10,300
* And he said, boys
I ain't turning

443
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,500
* I'm headed for a
land that's far away

444
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,433
* Beside the crystal mountain

445
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:19,567
* So come with me
we'll all go and see

446
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:22,333
* The Big Rock Candy Mountains

447
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,333
* Yeah, the Big
Rock Candy Mountains

448
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:28,100
* There's a land
that's fair and bright

449
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,067
* Where the handouts
grow on bushes

450
00:33:31,067 --> 00:33:34,100
* And you sleep out every night

451
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,133
* Where the boxcars
all are empty

452
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:40,167
* And the sun shines every day

453
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:42,667
* On the birds and bees
and the cigarette trees *

454
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:46,800
[Voiceover] January 27th,
I now only see two options.

455
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,233
Either I'm affected, and
the virus story was real,

456
00:33:50,233 --> 00:33:52,733
Or it's the somehow
more frightening option.

457
00:33:52,733 --> 00:33:54,867
Sam was right.

458
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:57,467
Which would mean he was hiding

459
00:33:57,467 --> 00:33:59,267
Because something
was following him.

460
00:34:00,067 --> 00:34:02,867
Whatever the case, I'm amazed
he survived here this long.

461
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,900
I can explain ghost radio waves,

462
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,233
They're old radio broadcasts
that bounce around the world

463
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:11,100
For years, that's science.

464
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,167
But how did the radio find
something from my past?

465
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:17,200
Is this real?

466
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,100
Why is all of this
becoming so familiar?

467
00:34:23,733 --> 00:34:26,967
* In the Big Rock
Candy Mountains

468
00:34:26,967 --> 00:34:29,667
* You never change your socks

469
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:32,733
* And the little old
streams of alcohol

470
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:35,633
* Come a tricklin'
down the rocks

471
00:34:35,633 --> 00:34:38,767
* Where the brakemen
have to tip their hats

472
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:42,067
* And the railroad
bulls are blind *

473
00:34:42,067 --> 00:34:43,600
January 28th.

474
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,100
For some reason Sam
has decided to go to

475
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,733
The most haunted
island in Australia.

476
00:34:50,533 --> 00:34:54,667
I have no ordinary explanation
for why Sam would go there

477
00:34:54,667 --> 00:34:56,533
Of all places.

478
00:34:59,633 --> 00:35:03,700
* Every Monday morning
they've got 'em out on time

479
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,700
* March 'em down to Lone Rock,
said to look into that mine

480
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:12,067
* March you down to Lone Rock,
said to look into that hole

481
00:35:12,067 --> 00:35:16,067
* Very last word the captain
say, you better get your coal

482
00:35:16,067 --> 00:35:18,300
* Oh, buddy, won't
you roll down the line

483
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,800
* Buddy, won't you
roll down the line *

484
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,100
(Radio static buzzing)

485
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,433
[Voiceover] The outbreak
cannot be stopped.

486
00:35:24,433 --> 00:35:27,333
Evacuate from
Tasmania at all costs.

487
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,433
From Maria Island.

488
00:35:29,433 --> 00:35:31,667
We're going through
hell, just rescue us.

489
00:35:34,067 --> 00:35:38,200
* Way back yonder in Tennessee,
they leased the convicts out

490
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,500
* They worked 'em in the coal
mines against free labor stout

491
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,667
* Free labor rebelled against
it, to win it took some time

492
00:35:46,667 --> 00:35:48,800
* But while the
lease was in effect

493
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,167
* They made 'em rise and shine

494
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:53,733
* Oh, buddy, won't
you roll down the line

495
00:35:53,733 --> 00:35:56,400
* Buddy, won't you
roll down the line

496
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,500
* Yonder come my darlin',
comin' down the line

497
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,267
* Buddy, won't you
roll down the line

498
00:36:02,267 --> 00:36:04,400
* Buddy, won't you
roll down the line

499
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,167
* Yonder come my darlin',
comin' down the line

500
00:36:24,267 --> 00:36:28,100
* Every Monday morning
they've got 'em out on time *

501
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,167
(Radio static buzzing)

502
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:33,500
[Voiceover] Brian,
uh it's Molly.

503
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,400
I've been trying to
call you all night.

504
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,567
Why won't you just pick
up your goddamn phone

505
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:42,067
To (mumbling)?

506
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,133
Hey, in the bathtub.

507
00:36:46,733 --> 00:36:49,067
You know I wanna tell
you there's no point,

508
00:36:49,067 --> 00:36:54,067
But Dad was drunk-driving
and something,

509
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,600
Something just went wrong.

510
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,567
And now both of our
parents, they're dead.

511
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,467
No, please, please!

512
00:37:06,467 --> 00:37:09,200
I just, I need one minute!

513
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,600
Okay, I don't know
what to do here.

514
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,700
They're trying to
take them away.

515
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:18,633
I really need your help.

516
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,933
When I got here,
Mom was still alive.

517
00:37:25,167 --> 00:37:27,400
Maybe she (mumbling) with...

518
00:37:28,067 --> 00:37:31,533
No please, I just need,
I just need one minute.

519
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,800
Brian...

520
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,433
I need you!

521
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:38,867
And I don't know how
I'm gonna tell Sam

522
00:37:38,867 --> 00:37:40,133
Any of this.

523
00:37:40,867 --> 00:37:42,567
He really looks up to you.

524
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,900
We need you, (mumbling).

525
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,633
(Sighs) I have to go.

526
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,300
Please help me.

527
00:37:56,633 --> 00:37:58,633
* March you down to Lone Rock

528
00:37:58,633 --> 00:38:00,733
* Said to look into that hole

529
00:38:00,733 --> 00:38:04,600
* Very last word the captain
say you better get your coal

530
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,067
* Oh, buddy, won't
you roll down the line

531
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:09,467
* Buddy, won't you
roll down the line

532
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:13,600
* Yonder come my darlin',
comin' down the line

533
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,400
* Buddy, won't you
roll down the line

534
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,867
* Buddy, won't you
roll down the line

535
00:38:17,867 --> 00:38:21,100
* Yonder come my darlin',
comin' down the line *

536
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:25,667
(Foreboding music)

537
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:27,867
[Voiceover] This
outbreak cannot be stopped.

538
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,133
Evacuate from
Tasmania at all costs.

539
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:33,133
From Maria Island?

540
00:38:33,133 --> 00:38:35,700
We're going through
hell, just rescue us.

541
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,767
This outbreak cannot be stopped.

542
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,067
Evacuate from
Tasmania at all costs.

543
00:38:42,067 --> 00:38:44,067
From Maria Island?

544
00:38:44,067 --> 00:38:46,133
We're going through
hell, just rescue us.

545
00:38:46,133 --> 00:38:50,800
(Foreboding music)

546
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,633
[Voiceover] This
outbreak cannot be stopped.

547
00:39:57,333 --> 00:40:00,033
Evacuate from
Tasmania at all costs.

548
00:40:00,033 --> 00:40:01,667
From Maria Island?

549
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:04,300
We're going through
hell, just rescue us.

550
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:14,433
(Rattling)
(growling)

551
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:47,967
(Cheerful music)

552
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:49,433
January 29th.

553
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:52,167
I have one week
left to find Sam,

554
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:53,800
But I still need to
cross eight kilometers

555
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,067
Of ocean to get him.

556
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,067
Now if I'm going
into enemy territory,

557
00:41:08,067 --> 00:41:09,467
I need to find a way to stop

558
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,067
Whatever these things are
if I come into contact

559
00:41:11,067 --> 00:41:12,267
With one again.

560
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,300
(Electricity sparking)

561
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:32,933
They seem to
communicate in some way

562
00:41:32,933 --> 00:41:36,567
With ghost radio waves,
some sort of infra-sound.

563
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,333
Somehow the radios
can pick it up.

564
00:41:44,067 --> 00:41:47,200
Let's say they're
ghosts like Sam claims.

565
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,367
But what are ghosts, really,

566
00:41:49,367 --> 00:41:51,433
Scientifically, no fantasy.

567
00:41:51,433 --> 00:41:53,633
What are all people
at their core?

568
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,333
Energy.

569
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:00,467
And how do you destroy something

570
00:42:00,467 --> 00:42:02,300
That can neither be
created nor destroyed?

571
00:42:03,567 --> 00:42:05,467
You destroy its power source.

572
00:42:05,467 --> 00:42:07,467
Destroy what it feeds off of.

573
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,933
Sam claimed electricity
attracted them

574
00:42:10,933 --> 00:42:12,400
Or even responded to them.

575
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,067
So what do we do?

576
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,067
We turn off the lights.

577
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,567
An electromagnetic pulse.

578
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,400
* Oh I'm going down
that road feeling bad

579
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,333
* Oh I'm going down
that road feeling bad

580
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:48,133
* Oh I'm going down
that road feeling bad

581
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:51,733
* And I ain't gonna
be treated this way *

582
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,233
All right come on you bastards.

583
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,100
(Rattling)
(moaning)

584
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,167
There we go.

585
00:43:11,167 --> 00:43:15,400
(Foreboding music)

586
00:43:17,267 --> 00:43:18,267
[Voiceover] You wanna see Sam,

587
00:43:18,267 --> 00:43:19,667
I know you do Brian.

588
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,833
I can smell you.

589
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:25,300
You're coming back home
with your brother, Brian.

590
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,400
That's right you son
of a bitch, over here.

591
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,600
[Voiceover] You cannot
run from me Brian.

592
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:34,100
Brian, guess who's back?

593
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,333
Almost...

594
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:36,933
[Voiceover] I know
you're up here, Brian.

595
00:43:36,933 --> 00:43:38,967
I'm coming Brian.

596
00:43:38,967 --> 00:43:40,300
Almost...

597
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,167
[Voiceover] Your
soul is mine, Brian!

598
00:43:42,167 --> 00:43:42,967
Now!

599
00:43:42,967 --> 00:43:45,900
(Electricity crackling)

600
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,767
January 30th.

601
00:44:07,567 --> 00:44:09,300
If I don't make it back,

602
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,567
Whoever finds this,

603
00:44:11,567 --> 00:44:14,633
EMP is how you stop them.

604
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,900
It seems to send them back

605
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,433
To wherever they come from.

606
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,300
Hope trumps fear, Sam.

607
00:44:25,067 --> 00:44:26,167
I'm coming.

608
00:44:26,167 --> 00:44:30,733
(Foreboding music)

609
00:45:17,233 --> 00:45:19,933
(Radio static buzzing)

610
00:45:19,933 --> 00:45:21,533
[Voiceover] This
outbreak cannot be stopped.

611
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,867
Evacuate from
Tasmania at all costs.

612
00:45:24,867 --> 00:45:27,467
I must warn anyone
who hears this.

613
00:45:27,467 --> 00:45:29,733
Stay away from Maria Island.

614
00:45:29,733 --> 00:45:31,467
Something is here.

615
00:45:31,467 --> 00:45:33,400
We have accidentally
opened something.

616
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,300
Okay, do not try and rescue us.

617
00:45:44,767 --> 00:45:49,367
(Foreboding music)

618
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,900
I must warn anyone
who hears this.

619
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,067
Stay away from Maria Island.

620
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:25,333
Something is here.

621
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:27,633
We have accidentally
opened something.

622
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:31,067
Okay, do not try and rescue us.

623
00:46:32,067 --> 00:46:33,767
There is no escape.

624
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:37,533
Help yourselves and
evacuate from Tasmania

625
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:39,133
At all costs.

626
00:46:44,867 --> 00:46:46,467
January 31st.

627
00:46:47,133 --> 00:46:48,567
I've determined that either Sam

628
00:46:48,567 --> 00:46:50,467
Is still somewhere
on this island,

629
00:46:50,467 --> 00:46:52,467
Or he has at least been
here very recently.

630
00:46:53,433 --> 00:46:55,800
This distress call seems
to be getting clearer

631
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,333
The closer I get
to the mountain.

632
00:46:57,833 --> 00:46:59,300
So tomorrow I'm
gonna try to attempt

633
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,300
To hike to the summit and
see if I can find the source

634
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,567
Of the signal.

635
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,100
I think it's what
Sam would've done.

636
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,933
And it's really the only lead
I have at this point, so.

637
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,567
The boat leaves in five days.

638
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,067
[Voiceover] Hello
again everybody,

639
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:19,233
We have a special
guest with us tonight,

640
00:47:19,233 --> 00:47:20,967
Brian Everett!

641
00:47:20,967 --> 00:47:22,967
It must feel like
you're on Maria Island,

642
00:47:22,967 --> 00:47:25,133
All dressed up
with nowhere to go.

643
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,833
It's terrible being
invited to a party

644
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:28,233
When no one's home!

645
00:47:28,233 --> 00:47:29,533
Take it from us folks!

646
00:47:29,533 --> 00:47:30,933
(Laughing)

647
00:47:30,933 --> 00:47:32,500
Well you just need patience.

648
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,167
Rest assured, the welcome mat

649
00:47:34,167 --> 00:47:36,833
Has been laid out
too for you, Brian.

650
00:47:36,833 --> 00:47:39,833
Enjoy your home and
see you soon buddy!

651
00:47:44,467 --> 00:47:46,900
[Voiceover] Okay do
not try and rescue us.

652
00:47:48,233 --> 00:47:49,767
There is no escape.

653
00:47:51,267 --> 00:47:53,867
I must warn anyone
who hears this.

654
00:47:53,867 --> 00:47:55,900
Stay away from Maria Island.

655
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,500
Something is here.

656
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,667
We have accidentally
opened something.

657
00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:04,067
Okay, do not try and rescue us.

658
00:48:05,067 --> 00:48:06,667
There is no escape.

659
00:48:08,133 --> 00:48:10,467
Help yourselves and
evacuate from Tasmania

660
00:48:10,467 --> 00:48:11,967
At all costs.

661
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,167
[Voiceover] Go back, Brian.

662
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:21,533
Don't follow the river.

663
00:48:21,533 --> 00:48:22,633
Sam?!

664
00:48:25,133 --> 00:48:26,400
[Voiceover] Go back, Brian.

665
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,467
[Brian] Sam?

666
00:48:28,533 --> 00:48:29,700
Sam?!

667
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:30,600
[Voiceover] Don't
follow the river.

668
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:37,767
Sam?

669
00:48:38,767 --> 00:48:39,733
Sam?!

670
00:48:50,667 --> 00:48:52,467
Please goddammit no, no!

671
00:48:52,467 --> 00:48:54,133
Come on, Sam come on,

672
00:48:54,133 --> 00:48:56,167
Come on wake up, wake up.

673
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:57,233
Come on!

674
00:48:57,233 --> 00:48:59,233
Oh no goddammit, come on!

675
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,933
What, no man, come
on, wake up Sam,

676
00:49:02,933 --> 00:49:04,233
Come on wake up, wake up!

677
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:07,700
One, two, three!

678
00:49:08,933 --> 00:49:10,433
Come on, come on wake up!

679
00:49:10,433 --> 00:49:12,133
One, two, three!

680
00:49:14,733 --> 00:49:15,633
Come on you can't come this far

681
00:49:15,633 --> 00:49:17,200
Just to stop Sam, come on!

682
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,067
One, two, three!

683
00:49:19,867 --> 00:49:21,067
Come on!

684
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,367
One, two, three!

685
00:49:25,367 --> 00:49:26,733
One, two!

686
00:49:26,733 --> 00:49:31,233
(Sad music)

687
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,667
What the hell is the point?

688
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,700
Just come and get me assholes.

689
00:50:13,367 --> 00:50:14,767
Come and get me.

690
00:50:21,633 --> 00:50:23,700
[Voiceover] Brian, Brian?

691
00:50:24,433 --> 00:50:27,267
Oh come on, this is
the best you got guys?

692
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,600
Screw you.

693
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,767
[Voiceover] Brian it's
me, where the hell are you?

694
00:50:33,767 --> 00:50:35,467
Bullshit it's you.

695
00:50:35,467 --> 00:50:36,933
[Voiceover] Oh
you're here too?

696
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:40,433
Yup on Maria Island
like you told me.

697
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,633
[Voiceover] No, I
told you to stay away

698
00:50:42,633 --> 00:50:43,867
From Maria Island.

699
00:50:43,867 --> 00:50:45,600
There's something
there, a doorway.

700
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,167
A doorway?

701
00:50:48,433 --> 00:50:49,467
And where are you?

702
00:50:49,467 --> 00:50:51,033
[Voiceover] On the other side.

703
00:50:51,033 --> 00:50:52,367
I went through.

704
00:50:53,867 --> 00:50:55,600
That's funny because

705
00:50:56,467 --> 00:50:57,967
I'm looking at your
dead body right now.

706
00:50:57,967 --> 00:50:59,233
[Voiceover] What?

707
00:51:00,467 --> 00:51:02,433
I just found it lying
here next to the river.

708
00:51:02,433 --> 00:51:03,667
[Voiceover] Oh shit.

709
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:04,833
Yeah.

710
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,933
[Voiceover] I
don't understand.

711
00:51:06,933 --> 00:51:08,733
I'm still alive, I
followed this track

712
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:10,767
All up the river,
and found a cave.

713
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:12,233
But there's something
in that cave, Brian.

714
00:51:12,233 --> 00:51:15,067
It's some kind of electrical
doorway to another place.

715
00:51:15,067 --> 00:51:16,800
I think it's where
they came from.

716
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,300
Like an old house.

717
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,800
That's where I am now.

718
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,933
Then why the hell
did you go through it?

719
00:51:21,933 --> 00:51:23,533
[Voiceover] I
thought I saw our dad.

720
00:51:23,533 --> 00:51:25,233
I wanted to apologize.

721
00:51:25,233 --> 00:51:26,600
Apologize?

722
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,933
Mom is dead.

723
00:51:29,567 --> 00:51:31,100
Dad is dead.

724
00:51:33,167 --> 00:51:34,167
And now you're dead.

725
00:51:34,167 --> 00:51:35,233
[Voiceover] Do
you still really

726
00:51:35,233 --> 00:51:36,667
Only think in black and white

727
00:51:36,667 --> 00:51:38,067
After seeing what we've seen?

728
00:51:38,667 --> 00:51:40,667
Tell science to get
lost for just a second,

729
00:51:40,667 --> 00:51:42,267
Believe me Brian.

730
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,800
I have no idea what I've seen.

731
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,067
I don't even know what
the hell I'm talking to

732
00:51:47,067 --> 00:51:48,600
Right now, okay?

733
00:51:49,567 --> 00:51:53,367
All I know is that, Sam is dead.

734
00:51:54,933 --> 00:51:57,467
I have no idea what the
hell I'm gonna do now.

735
00:51:58,267 --> 00:51:59,533
[Voiceover] Keep going.

736
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,833
What?

737
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:04,533
[Voiceover] If you're going
through hell, keep going.

738
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,300
Are you really there?

739
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:08,767
[Voiceover] Yes, but
something is holding me here.

740
00:52:08,767 --> 00:52:11,167
I think it's Dad, or (mumbling).

741
00:52:11,167 --> 00:52:12,900
I need your help, Brian.

742
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,800
How am I supposed to
help you if you're dead.

743
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,100
[Voiceover] Go
through the doorway,

744
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,533
Find our old house.

745
00:52:17,533 --> 00:52:19,133
What the hell are
you talking about?

746
00:52:19,133 --> 00:52:20,867
[Voiceover] You'll
wake up in a pool,

747
00:52:20,867 --> 00:52:22,533
Go to the woods and
follow the signs for home,

748
00:52:22,533 --> 00:52:23,933
Through the abandoned buildings.

749
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:25,100
Please Brian.

750
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:26,800
Sam?

751
00:52:27,133 --> 00:52:27,900
Sam?!

752
00:52:28,433 --> 00:52:29,233
Sam...

753
00:52:31,633 --> 00:52:36,067
(Foreboding music)

754
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,700
So you're alive huh?

755
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,633
You know?

756
00:52:56,667 --> 00:52:59,533
I used to see ghosts
when I was a kid too.

757
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,200
Back before you were even born.

758
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:05,933
I never responded
to 'em or anything,

759
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:08,667
I just didn't want 'em to,

760
00:53:08,667 --> 00:53:10,500
Actually I didn't wanna
get near 'em you know?

761
00:53:12,467 --> 00:53:14,100
I thought maybe I
could trick 'em or,

762
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:16,233
Play stupid.

763
00:53:18,133 --> 00:53:19,633
I didn't even think I actually

764
00:53:20,567 --> 00:53:22,133
Ever knew what they were.

765
00:53:22,133 --> 00:53:23,500
Until right now.

766
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,133
I mean the last time I
saw them I was probably

767
00:53:27,133 --> 00:53:28,700
I don't know, four or five.

768
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:35,700
But what I saw was

769
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,400
You looking exactly
like you do right now.

770
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,967
And all you'd ever
say to me was,

771
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:45,633
"Save me."

772
00:53:46,767 --> 00:53:48,233
Over and over.

773
00:53:51,633 --> 00:53:55,100
I don't know if you
really are Sam or not,

774
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:59,100
And I don't know if
this is a trap or not,

775
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,833
But I'm coming for you.

776
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,100
All of you!

777
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,200
And I'm gonna send
every last one of you

778
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,067
Back to where you belong.

779
00:54:39,767 --> 00:54:41,800
This message is
for Molly Everett,

780
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,733
Her address is 4085,

781
00:54:43,733 --> 00:54:46,267
Chariot Lane, Santa
Barbara, California.

782
00:54:47,967 --> 00:54:51,067
Molly if you are watching this,

783
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,600
It means I've failed and
that both Sam and I are dead.

784
00:54:57,067 --> 00:54:58,167
I know that

785
00:54:58,867 --> 00:55:00,833
You had a really
hard time growing up,

786
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,367
And I know I was
never there for you

787
00:55:03,367 --> 00:55:04,533
When I should've been,

788
00:55:05,267 --> 00:55:07,200
And I know that
you've been mad at me

789
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,700
For, (mumbling),
coming down here

790
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:11,600
To try to save my brother, but,

791
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,067
In a classic Dad move,

792
00:55:14,967 --> 00:55:16,133
The problem with the will was

793
00:55:16,133 --> 00:55:19,167
That he didn't even
leave us anything.

794
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,467
He gave everything to some guy.

795
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,133
Some friend of his,
and I've been down here

796
00:55:25,133 --> 00:55:26,267
For a month.

797
00:55:26,767 --> 00:55:28,700
Trying to convince this guy

798
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,867
To give me some money

799
00:55:29,867 --> 00:55:31,867
So I can afford
to see my brother.

800
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:38,867
But it's okay...

801
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,533
If you do get this Molly,

802
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,733
Please just don't be afraid.

803
00:55:45,933 --> 00:55:49,533
Okay, fear, it's the
easiest emotion to have,

804
00:55:50,367 --> 00:55:51,567
You know that's why
Dad always used it,

805
00:55:51,567 --> 00:55:53,467
That's why he was
always addicted to it.

806
00:55:54,467 --> 00:55:55,667
He would always use it on us,

807
00:55:55,667 --> 00:55:57,333
Whenever his life
wasn't going his way.

808
00:55:58,233 --> 00:55:59,267
And...

809
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,067
Just nothing when we were kids,

810
00:56:04,067 --> 00:56:04,967
When you grew up, nothing

811
00:56:04,967 --> 00:56:06,967
Has ever been your fault, Molly.

812
00:56:06,967 --> 00:56:09,233
Okay, okay?

813
00:56:09,767 --> 00:56:11,967
Don't let Dad's
weakness ruin you,

814
00:56:11,967 --> 00:56:14,933
Don't, just don't let his
bullshit ruin your life.

815
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,400
Okay, because you're
better than that.

816
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,767
Mom and Dad were not our family.

817
00:56:22,667 --> 00:56:25,700
We were our family,
just you, Sam and I.

818
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:26,933
That's it.

819
00:56:27,867 --> 00:56:29,333
And it always will be.

820
00:56:30,667 --> 00:56:33,333
Just let your bullshit
go and go live your life.

821
00:56:34,133 --> 00:56:35,733
Because you were
always the smartest

822
00:56:35,733 --> 00:56:37,833
Of us, and you were
always the best of us.

823
00:56:38,933 --> 00:56:40,500
And I should've
told you more, but,

824
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,267
I just never did.

825
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,733
Please just go do
something great, Molly.

826
00:56:47,733 --> 00:56:49,367
Because I know you can.

827
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:53,567
And if you're looking
for Dad's ashes,

828
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,633
I've dig 'em up, in an effort

829
00:56:55,633 --> 00:56:56,833
To finally try to use him

830
00:56:56,833 --> 00:56:58,300
For something good for once.

831
00:57:00,767 --> 00:57:04,733
I wanna use him to help
me save our brother.

832
00:57:07,867 --> 00:57:09,200
Goodbye Molly.

833
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:13,567
(Sad music)

834
00:57:54,133 --> 00:57:56,467
[Voiceover] This
outbreak cannot be stopped.

835
00:57:56,467 --> 00:57:58,833
I must warn anyone
who hears this.

836
00:57:58,833 --> 00:58:01,367
Stay away from Maria Island.

837
00:58:01,367 --> 00:58:03,067
Something is here.

838
00:58:03,067 --> 00:58:05,433
We have accidentally
opened something.

839
00:58:05,433 --> 00:58:08,133
Some kind of portal
into another world.

840
00:58:08,133 --> 00:58:09,700
We're outside.

841
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:12,367
We're there now, and
there is no escape.

842
00:58:12,367 --> 00:58:14,267
Do not try and rescue us.

843
00:58:14,267 --> 00:58:16,933
Okay, do not try and rescue us.

844
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,767
This (mumbling).

845
00:58:20,333 --> 00:58:23,333
If you stay here in
Tasmania, you will die.

846
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,500
We are here (mumbling).

847
00:58:26,233 --> 00:58:30,067
Help yourselves to evacuate
from Tasmania at all costs.

848
00:58:30,433 --> 00:58:35,433
(Anticipating music)

849
00:59:01,733 --> 00:59:06,733
(Faint country music)

850
01:00:23,267 --> 01:00:24,533
[Voiceover] Save me.

851
01:00:24,533 --> 01:00:25,767
[Brian] Sam!

852
01:00:26,367 --> 01:00:27,267
Sam?

853
01:00:27,267 --> 01:00:31,967
(Foreboding music)

854
01:00:48,133 --> 01:00:49,333
[Voiceover] Brian?

855
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:50,600
Brian.

856
01:00:52,333 --> 01:00:53,800
Keep going, sweet.

857
01:00:54,933 --> 01:00:56,300
Follow my voice.

858
01:01:00,133 --> 01:01:01,467
Follow my voice.

859
01:01:04,333 --> 01:01:05,967
Keep going, sweet.

860
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,733
You need to hurry Brian.

861
01:01:13,233 --> 01:01:15,067
Your brother is in trouble.

862
01:01:23,833 --> 01:01:25,067
Hey Mom.

863
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,300
[Voiceover] Yes honey.

864
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:30,800
I don't have much time
before he takes me again.

865
01:01:31,633 --> 01:01:32,833
Who Mom?

866
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,133
[Voiceover] Listen to me.

867
01:01:35,633 --> 01:01:37,800
Your device will
not work as it is.

868
01:01:38,567 --> 01:01:40,367
It's not powerful enough yet

869
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:41,633
To destroy him.

870
01:01:41,633 --> 01:01:43,067
What are you talking about?

871
01:01:43,767 --> 01:01:45,533
[Voiceover] It
needs more energy.

872
01:01:46,067 --> 01:01:48,700
You must use my soul
as the catalyst.

873
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:49,833
What do you mean?

874
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:52,467
[Voiceover] Take my necklace.

875
01:01:54,733 --> 01:01:56,900
Now you have all that I am.

876
01:01:57,367 --> 01:01:59,867
Place that in your machine
when you activate it.

877
01:02:00,567 --> 01:02:02,867
Use me as your power source.

878
01:02:03,533 --> 01:02:04,800
I don't understand.

879
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,500
[Voiceover] Brian I
am his counterbalance.

880
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,333
You have to do this.

881
01:02:10,333 --> 01:02:12,233
It has to be you.

882
01:02:12,733 --> 01:02:14,767
Or we'll never be free.

883
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,767
What if I do this?

884
01:02:16,767 --> 01:02:18,267
What happens to you?

885
01:02:19,067 --> 01:02:20,567
Will you be gone forever?

886
01:02:21,067 --> 01:02:22,900
[Voiceover]
Nothing's gone, Brian.

887
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:27,100
It's just not there anymore.

888
01:02:27,667 --> 01:02:28,800
Honey?

889
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,767
Baby, I'm so sorry
for everything

890
01:02:30,767 --> 01:02:32,633
You kids had to go through.

891
01:02:33,767 --> 01:02:36,533
You must do this so that
I can finally help you,

892
01:02:37,067 --> 01:02:38,567
It's the only way.

893
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:40,967
I'm so proud of you Brian.

894
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:44,067
I love you Brian.

895
01:02:45,467 --> 01:02:47,333
I love all of you.

896
01:02:53,133 --> 01:02:58,133
(Phone ringing)

897
01:03:04,267 --> 01:03:05,467
[Voiceover] Save me.

898
01:03:22,133 --> 01:03:23,567
[Voiceover] Hey
Dad, it's Brian.

899
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,767
Look I know it's been
a really long time

900
01:03:25,767 --> 01:03:27,300
Since we talked, and,

901
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:28,967
I know the last time
didn't go so well,

902
01:03:28,967 --> 01:03:31,667
But, I just,

903
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:33,200
Look Dad, I can't
keep pretending

904
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,067
Like at you did to
us never happened.

905
01:03:35,833 --> 01:03:39,233
I've been trying for years, but,

906
01:03:39,233 --> 01:03:41,300
It just won't go away.

907
01:03:42,467 --> 01:03:44,100
Every time I see Molly and Sam

908
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:45,600
I can see them
where you left 'em,

909
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,267
And I can see

910
01:03:48,267 --> 01:03:49,533
How they can't
even look at people

911
01:03:49,533 --> 01:03:51,167
In the eyes anymore
because of you.

912
01:03:52,067 --> 01:03:53,167
And it kills me.

913
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,333
Because unlike you,

914
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,733
I actually care for
them more than anything

915
01:03:57,733 --> 01:03:59,100
Else in the world.

916
01:03:59,867 --> 01:04:02,400
And now since you
are what you are,

917
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,467
The job to protect
them has fallen on me.

918
01:04:06,367 --> 01:04:08,200
And I'm sure you'll just
call me overdramatic

919
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,867
Or a liar like usual, you know,

920
01:04:09,867 --> 01:04:11,267
Whenever I try to
bring up the truth

921
01:04:11,267 --> 01:04:12,833
About things you are
probably too drunk

922
01:04:12,833 --> 01:04:14,067
To even remember.

923
01:04:15,067 --> 01:04:16,900
But that doesn't mean
it didn't happen.

924
01:04:17,467 --> 01:04:19,767
You have done some
horrible things to us.

925
01:04:19,767 --> 01:04:21,867
And ever since I
remember, you've taught

926
01:04:21,867 --> 01:04:24,167
Me through your actions
that you were the one

927
01:04:24,167 --> 01:04:27,167
Thing I should fear more
than anything or anyone else.

928
01:04:27,967 --> 01:04:29,467
But I'm not a kid anymore,

929
01:04:29,467 --> 01:04:30,667
And I don't have
to bite my tongue

930
01:04:30,667 --> 01:04:31,667
And pretend like we deserved

931
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:33,067
What you did to us.

932
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:36,700
I may be your child, but,
I'm not your property.

933
01:04:37,733 --> 01:04:39,967
Now if you ever want to have
a relationship with me again,

934
01:04:39,967 --> 01:04:42,100
You need to call me and
finally apologize for what you

935
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:43,367
Did to all of us.

936
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:45,967
Otherwise,

937
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:47,767
This is it.

938
01:04:49,533 --> 01:04:50,767
Goodbye Dad.

939
01:04:57,933 --> 01:04:59,600
[Voiceover] Good
evening everybody,

940
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,100
Tonight we're going to explore

941
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,867
The dark history of
the Everett family.

942
01:05:03,867 --> 01:05:05,600
All of their ghosts and demons

943
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:08,567
Under the floorboard
will be revealed!

944
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:17,100
(Cheerful music)

945
01:05:30,333 --> 01:05:31,800
Here was the dreaded kitchen

946
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,267
Where Mommy and Daddy Everett's

947
01:05:33,267 --> 01:05:35,133
Drinking problem began.

948
01:05:35,133 --> 01:05:37,433
Daddy would stay up
all night drinking away

949
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:40,700
Both his problems
and Mommy's money.

950
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:42,300
The children could
be heard yelling

951
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:44,667
Into the wee hours
of the morning.

952
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:46,633
Poor little Molly, Sam and Brian

953
01:05:46,633 --> 01:05:48,567
Were defenseless,
and could only watch

954
01:05:48,567 --> 01:05:50,367
In terror as their parents would

955
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:53,467
Turn themselves into monsters.

956
01:05:58,667 --> 01:06:01,433
The living room, the
television was the children's

957
01:06:01,433 --> 01:06:04,567
Only friend in this
house of terror.

958
01:06:04,567 --> 01:06:06,533
A place of sanctuary for them

959
01:06:06,533 --> 01:06:08,567
To manage their
wounds and pretend

960
01:06:08,567 --> 01:06:10,833
They had different lives.

961
01:06:26,567 --> 01:06:28,733
And poor, poor, Sam.

962
01:06:28,733 --> 01:06:30,533
When he'd see things
his father couldn't

963
01:06:30,533 --> 01:06:33,233
Understand, he would
become a punching bag.

964
01:06:33,233 --> 01:06:35,533
This is the dreaded
room where'd he pray

965
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:38,967
Every night, not for
the safety of others,

966
01:06:38,967 --> 01:06:41,900
But the demise of
his own father,

967
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:43,400
Praying that one day he wouldn't

968
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,067
Have to wear long-sleeved shirts

969
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:46,467
For the rest of his life

970
01:06:46,467 --> 01:06:48,167
To hide his secrets.

971
01:06:48,167 --> 01:06:52,067
Where or where was
his big brother?

972
01:07:00,567 --> 01:07:02,600
Little Molly's bedroom,

973
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,300
She thought the
more toys she had,

974
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:06,233
The more friends she'd have!

975
01:07:06,233 --> 01:07:07,800
Unfortunately all they ever did

976
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,800
Was trap her in the
(mumbling) prison,

977
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:13,633
And constantly remind
her there was no way out.

978
01:07:13,633 --> 01:07:15,467
She became deaf to advice,

979
01:07:15,467 --> 01:07:17,600
Trapped in her own world.

980
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,667
No way Brian would
ever come home

981
01:07:19,667 --> 01:07:23,833
To save them, he'd
never be her hero again.

982
01:07:36,567 --> 01:07:40,367
And last but not least,
the oldest child, Brian.

983
01:07:40,367 --> 01:07:43,567
He was always so
quiet, they said.

984
01:07:43,567 --> 01:07:45,600
He handled their
troubled childhood

985
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,733
The best, they said.

986
01:07:47,733 --> 01:07:49,733
Brian was the strong one.

987
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:51,467
The devil's advocate.

988
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:54,100
Nothing ever got to Brian.

989
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:58,300
No one would ever expect
Brian to kill his own parents.

990
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:00,167
I didn't kill them.

991
01:08:00,733 --> 01:08:02,933
[Voiceover] Dad
is dead, Brian.

992
01:08:02,933 --> 01:08:05,833
(Audience booing)

993
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:08,067
It was an accident,
nobody was gonna miss them.

994
01:08:08,067 --> 01:08:10,833
[Voiceover] Except
poor little Brian.

995
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:11,967
What are the odds people

996
01:08:11,967 --> 01:08:14,333
That some cookie
eggheads opened the door

997
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:15,667
To another world,

998
01:08:15,667 --> 01:08:18,533
Brian here would enter
it after doing something

999
01:08:18,533 --> 01:08:20,600
So bad.

1000
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:21,900
It wasn't my fault.

1001
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:24,367
[Voiceover] Such
a shocking moment

1002
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:26,833
That changed the
Everett family forever.

1003
01:08:26,833 --> 01:08:28,767
But stay tuned folks,
after the break

1004
01:08:28,767 --> 01:08:30,967
We're going to the
most terrifying room

1005
01:08:30,967 --> 01:08:35,067
In the house, Daddy's room.

1006
01:08:38,233 --> 01:08:39,400
It wasn't my fault.

1007
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:44,267
(Foreboding music)

1008
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:50,967
[Voiceover] Hey Sam it's me.

1009
01:08:52,767 --> 01:08:54,633
Look I uh, I'm really sorry

1010
01:08:54,633 --> 01:08:56,067
I didn't show up to
the funeral today,

1011
01:08:56,067 --> 01:08:59,633
But, I just couldn't
bring myself to be there.

1012
01:09:00,567 --> 01:09:02,700
And I know you and
Molly needed me,

1013
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,567
I'm sure especially
today of all days,

1014
01:09:04,567 --> 01:09:07,867
But, I have something

1015
01:09:07,867 --> 01:09:09,567
That I need to tell you right.

1016
01:09:10,733 --> 01:09:13,100
Look, I saw Mom and Dad
the night they died.

1017
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:16,367
Oh it had been
years, and I figured

1018
01:09:16,367 --> 01:09:17,933
I tried to patch
things up with them,

1019
01:09:17,933 --> 01:09:19,967
See if I could salvage anything,

1020
01:09:19,967 --> 01:09:22,700
But, when I saw them,

1021
01:09:23,733 --> 01:09:25,367
Dad started drinking

1022
01:09:25,367 --> 01:09:28,067
And he starting hitting Mom.

1023
01:09:29,067 --> 01:09:30,733
I couldn't take it anymore,

1024
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:32,467
So I tried to make him stop,

1025
01:09:32,467 --> 01:09:34,733
But, of course he wouldn't.

1026
01:09:35,567 --> 01:09:37,067
Then I tried to take Mom away,

1027
01:09:37,067 --> 01:09:39,633
But, she wouldn't come with me.

1028
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:43,067
So I just let her
in the car with dad.

1029
01:09:43,067 --> 01:09:44,800
I watched them both drive away.

1030
01:09:46,167 --> 01:09:47,933
I knew how drunk Dad was.

1031
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:50,567
I couldn't come today because,

1032
01:09:51,433 --> 01:09:53,167
Because I let our parents die.

1033
01:09:54,233 --> 01:09:55,800
It's because I was angry.

1034
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,800
Because I love you guys
more than anything,

1035
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,533
And, I hope someday
you understand

1036
01:10:00,533 --> 01:10:01,867
Why I did what I did,

1037
01:10:01,867 --> 01:10:04,567
Because, my place in the world

1038
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:06,733
Is just to protect both of you,

1039
01:10:06,733 --> 01:10:08,033
From people like them.

1040
01:10:09,433 --> 01:10:11,100
I'm so sorry Sam.

1041
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:14,833
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

1042
01:10:16,533 --> 01:10:17,367
Goodbye.

1043
01:10:17,367 --> 01:10:21,900
(Distant country music)

1044
01:10:32,067 --> 01:10:32,833
(Growling)

1045
01:10:32,833 --> 01:10:34,567
[Voiceover] Brian.

1046
01:10:38,433 --> 01:10:39,867
Brian.

1047
01:10:42,767 --> 01:10:44,300
Brian.

1048
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:47,700
This way, Brian.

1049
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:55,867
How could you not
recognize your own father?

1050
01:10:56,467 --> 01:10:58,767
Your own (mumbling),

1051
01:10:58,767 --> 01:11:01,133
Your never-ending nightmare.

1052
01:11:01,867 --> 01:11:03,100
Right now...

1053
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:06,267
[Voiceover] Are you
not afraid of me, Brian?

1054
01:11:06,867 --> 01:11:08,233
Well in that case,

1055
01:11:08,233 --> 01:11:09,867
Apologize finally.

1056
01:11:10,567 --> 01:11:12,067
For what you did to us.

1057
01:11:13,067 --> 01:11:15,833
Or I will destroy all of you.

1058
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:17,833
[Voiceover] You
cannot destroy us.

1059
01:11:17,833 --> 01:11:20,167
Nor can you create us.

1060
01:11:20,167 --> 01:11:23,567
But soon, you will become us.

1061
01:11:23,567 --> 01:11:25,667
You will all be down here.

1062
01:11:25,667 --> 01:11:28,400
Your sister, your brother,

1063
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:32,333
Your friends, everyone
you've ever known.

1064
01:11:32,333 --> 01:11:35,867
You will all come down here.

1065
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:37,833
That's interesting.

1066
01:11:37,833 --> 01:11:39,167
What you just said.

1067
01:11:39,167 --> 01:11:40,100
That you can neither be created

1068
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:41,400
Nor destroyed?

1069
01:11:42,067 --> 01:11:43,500
Because on the other hand,

1070
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,867
Electricity, which
is what it seems like

1071
01:11:45,867 --> 01:11:47,933
You things feed
off of down here,

1072
01:11:47,933 --> 01:11:49,933
Actually can be destroyed.

1073
01:11:49,933 --> 01:11:51,867
(Laughing)

1074
01:11:51,867 --> 01:11:54,267
[Voiceover] You do
not have the power.

1075
01:11:54,267 --> 01:11:58,833
You can either try it
before you, (mumbling)

1076
01:11:58,833 --> 01:12:03,133
For the (mumbling).

1077
01:12:03,133 --> 01:12:06,300
You are forever
trapped down here.

1078
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:07,633
You know what I think?

1079
01:12:08,567 --> 01:12:10,067
I think Sam was right.

1080
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,533
I think that these portals
are all over the place.

1081
01:12:13,433 --> 01:12:14,867
I think there was
probably even one

1082
01:12:14,867 --> 01:12:16,600
Near this very house when
we were kids, wasn't there?

1083
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,233
You've been with us
forever, haven't you?

1084
01:12:19,733 --> 01:12:21,500
And now you're just
afraid of losing us.

1085
01:12:22,133 --> 01:12:23,900
You're just afraid
of losing our fear.

1086
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:25,733
[Voiceover] You think
you can destroy me

1087
01:12:25,733 --> 01:12:27,067
With that?

1088
01:12:28,267 --> 01:12:29,700
Seems simple enough.

1089
01:12:30,267 --> 01:12:32,067
I mean after all, how do
you turn off the lights?

1090
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,233
You just press the
off switch, right?

1091
01:12:34,233 --> 01:12:37,633
[Voiceover] Foolish boy,
you think it is that simple?

1092
01:12:38,233 --> 01:12:40,967
Yeah, it is that simple.

1093
01:12:41,967 --> 01:12:44,300
And I only have one
thing left to say to you.

1094
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,633
From the very,

1095
01:12:47,433 --> 01:12:49,100
Very bottom of my heart.

1096
01:12:49,967 --> 01:12:51,733
Fuck you, Dad.

1097
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:57,400
(Electricity crackling)

1098
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:15,167
(Laughing)

1099
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:09,067
(Radio static buzzing)

1100
01:14:09,067 --> 01:14:10,267
[Voiceover] It's
been nearly three hours

1101
01:14:10,267 --> 01:14:11,767
Since the strange
light was seen above

1102
01:14:11,767 --> 01:14:13,100
Eastern Tasmania,

1103
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:15,067
And so far, the
government is unavailable

1104
01:14:15,067 --> 01:14:16,267
For comment.

1105
01:14:16,267 --> 01:14:17,733
Rumors are spreading fast

1106
01:14:17,733 --> 01:14:19,567
That Tasmania's
quarantine may finally

1107
01:14:19,567 --> 01:14:21,600
Be lifted in the coming days.

1108
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,333
More info as it comes.

1109
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:25,700
Until then, more music.

1110
01:14:27,367 --> 01:14:32,133
(Calming music)

1111
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:40,633
[Voiceover] Hello?

1112
01:14:41,067 --> 01:14:42,333
[Voiceover] Hey
Molly, it's Brian.

1113
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:43,833
I found him.

1114
01:14:44,467 --> 01:14:45,667
[Voiceover] Is he okay?

1115
01:14:46,233 --> 01:14:47,633
[Voiceover] Yeah,
yes, he looks fine.

1116
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:49,567
[Voiceover] How did
you find him, Brian?

1117
01:14:50,067 --> 01:14:51,800
[Voiceover] I finally
did what I had to do.

1118
01:14:54,433 --> 01:14:56,067
Look Molly, sometimes,

1119
01:14:56,067 --> 01:14:58,733
We need to just stop trying
to explain everything.

1120
01:14:58,733 --> 01:15:00,167
Just say thank you.

1121
01:15:01,067 --> 01:15:03,633
[Voiceover] Fine, thank you.

1122
01:15:04,567 --> 01:15:07,333
I guess I'll see you
when you get back.

1123
01:15:08,233 --> 01:15:11,333
[Voiceover] Hey Molly,
I'm here all right?

1124
01:15:12,667 --> 01:15:14,900
From now on, I promise

1125
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:16,533
That we're all gonna be okay.

1126
01:15:19,333 --> 01:15:20,500
I love you Molly.

1127
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:24,467
[Voiceover] I love you too.

1128
01:15:24,467 --> 01:15:28,933
(Calming music)

1129
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:32,900
* And I

1130
01:15:34,067 --> 01:15:36,333
* Hope you can relate

1131
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,567
* And you've got lots

1132
01:15:42,567 --> 01:15:46,233
* Of worries that
you can't put to bed

1133
01:15:47,733 --> 01:15:51,567
* And I don't need
to be one of them

1134
01:15:55,367 --> 01:15:59,267
* And I can't seem to get her

1135
01:15:59,267 --> 01:16:02,067
* To tell me the truth

1136
01:16:03,433 --> 01:16:06,167
* And I don't want it to be

1137
01:16:06,167 --> 01:16:08,200
* Like that

1138
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:12,300
* When I'm sick

1139
01:16:13,567 --> 01:16:14,933
* And dying

1140
01:16:38,833 --> 01:16:42,800
* She told me that
you never raised

1141
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,233
* Your voice at her once

1142
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:47,900
* And now she runs

1143
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:50,333
* When it gets tough

1144
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,800
* When it gets tough

1145
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,700
* But I

1146
01:17:03,233 --> 01:17:05,667
* Made a mistake

1147
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:12,733
* And I

1148
01:17:13,533 --> 01:17:15,833
* Hope you can relate

1149
01:17:19,633 --> 01:17:22,167
* And I've got questions

1150
01:17:22,167 --> 01:17:26,267
* And I've got questions for you

1151
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:32,267
* And I've got questions

1152
01:17:32,267 --> 01:17:36,700
* And I've got things
you need to prove *
