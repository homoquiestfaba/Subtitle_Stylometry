00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:39,610

531
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,946
has never been taken
in the spirit it was intended...

532
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:44,515
which was a quote, a quote.

533
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:46,951
And that's what Adam Smith
was really saying...

534
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:48,286
in The Wealth of Nations.

535
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:50,288
At least,
that's what I've always thought.

536
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:53,458
- More tea, Oscar?
- Thank you, Abigail.

537
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,461
Now, most people
are going to tell you...

538
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,463
that Quine's belief
in the inherent goodness...

539
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:02,066
But, Oscar, I don't see how you
can dismiss Mirabeau so easily.

540
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:04,235
Mirabeau never even
got out of the gate.

541
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,971
Oh, you naughty girl.

542
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:09,674
- Where did you find him?
- Isn't he lovely?

543
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:13,778
He's so passionate,
and he really listens.

544
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,913
Do you mind
if I give him my number?

545
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:17,215
No. Go ahead.

546
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:19,884
Oscar, I'd love to chat
more with you...

547
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:23,421
about this sometime
or, um, about anything.

548
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:26,791
I'm pretty busy
with midterms and all.

549
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,460
Anything, anytime.

550
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,929
- Bye, Oscar.
- Bye, Samantha.

551
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:33,664
- Bye, Oscar.
- Abigail.

552
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:36,531
- Bye, Diane.
- Bye, girls.

553
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:44,008
Well, Oscar,
it was a pleasure to meet you.

554
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:45,276
Pleasure.

555
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:48,012
<i>You two be good Heh heh</i>

556
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:50,537
I'll call you tomorrow.

557
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,952
- Diane.
- Mm-hmm.

558
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:57,355
You didn't, uh, tell anybody...

559
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:59,790
about what happened last night,
did you?

560
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,727
Does it matter if I had?
You're a grown-up...

561
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,629
or close enough.

562
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,221
Did you?

563
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:12,703
I didn't say anything definite.

564
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:14,305
I may have hinted a little.

565
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:17,241
Hinted? Why do they need hints?
This isn't charades.

566
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,043
What if one of them tells Phil?

567
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:22,213
- Phil, schmil.
- "Phil, schmil?"

568
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:25,249
That isn't very nice. That
isn't very sensitive at all.

569
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:28,619
Oscar, please.
Phil and I are not an item.

570
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:31,989
Ahem. Excuse me.
There's no smoking.

571
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,491
OK.

572
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:36,227
Forget about Phil.

573
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:39,764
Diane, I'd like to ask you...

574
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,332
not to come to dinner tonight.

575
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:43,868
Not go to Cafe Balou?

576
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,503
Are you kidding?
Your father's paying.

577
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:46,704
I want to minimize
the likelihood...

578
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,262
of your blabbing to Eve.

579
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,343
Maybe you've already told Eve.

580
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,679
I haven't even seen Eve yet.

581
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,081
Yet?
Do you plan to tell her?

582
00:36:57,081 --> 00:37:00,651
Oscar,
Eve and I grew up together.

583
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:04,055
Jeez, the stories I could tell
you about Eve when we were 15.

584
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,489
You wouldn't have
recognized her.

585
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:06,657
I don't want to hear it.

586
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:10,228
When we were fifteen,
Eve had this thing for Elvis.

587
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,697
- Elvis Presley?
- Hmm.

588
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,699
Flipped for any guy
in sideburns.

589
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:18,069
Sideburns? What's so great
about sideburns?

590
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,237
I don't know.

591
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,572
The strangest things
made her happy.

592
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,175
She was always happy back then.

593
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:28,077
Back then?
Are you saying now she isn't?

594
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,050
No.
That wasn't my intention.

595
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,218
Look. You know what?

596
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:35,920
Let's just forget it.
I shouldn't have said anything.

597
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,088
No. We can't just forget it.

598
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,056
We're talking about
Eve's happiness here.

599
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,928
I guess I can confide in you.
We're close now, right?

600
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,397
In a manner of speaking.

601
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:47,932
OK. Ahem.

602
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,935
I don't think Eve is happy.

603
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,971
There's a void.
Something's missing.

604
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:55,740
What makes you say that?

605
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,943
It's a woman thing.
I sense it. I feel it.

606
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,379
Plus, last week,
she said there was a void...

607
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,414
and something was missing.

608
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:04,782
Did she say what?

609
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,580
Couldn't put her finger on it.

610
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:13,986
I wouldn't worry about it.
She'll get over it.

611
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:22,133
<i>CHARLIE:</i>
<i>So. Who is this girl?</i>

612
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,402
A friend of the family's.

613
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,003
You gonna see each other again?

614
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:30,007
Tonight. But her best friend's
gonna be there.

615
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:32,109
Well, is the friend cute?

616
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:34,111
I wouldn't call her cute,
exactly.

617
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,914
I mean, would I like her?

618
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:39,246
Well, you know,
I slept with her last night.

619
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:42,787
With the friend?

620
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,588
Damn!

621
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:46,857
<i>Yeah. With the friend</i>

622
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:48,926
But you don't like the friend.

623
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:52,096
Not really. Not like that.

624
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,865
But you're going to dinner
with both of them...

625
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:58,202
the woman you like
and the woman you slept with?

626
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:00,932
Yeah.
My dad's coming, too.

627
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,934
Nothing's simple
for the Grubber.

628
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:12,850
Talk to me, Oscar.

629
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,286
What's going on here?

630
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,254
I don't know, Charlie.

631
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:18,889
I found her.

632
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:20,391
The girl with the great hands.

633
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,193
Terrific hands.

634
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,524
Are you gonna tell me her name?

635
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:29,367
Eve.

636
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,736
Eve... like your mother.

637
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,537
Eve's not my mother.
She's my stepmother.

638
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,095
We're not blood relatives
at all.

639
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:42,380
Wait. So, your Eve is that Eve?
Your mother?

640
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,982
She's very wise...

641
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:47,985
and soft.

642
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:50,254
Are you out of your mind?

643
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:52,356
Do you want to end up in hell
or something?

644
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:54,258
Charlie, I love her.

645
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:58,229
Oscar,
Eve is married to your father.

646
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,265
I know, but I sense there's
a void there... something missing.

647
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:03,234
She needs something more
in her life.

648
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,795
Oh, and that would be you...
her stepson.

649
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:11,976
I mean, hey, I know you're
French, and you have, like...

650
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:15,513
a different idea
of family relations, but...

651
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:20,050
Wait.
This means you slept with Diane.

652
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:23,454
I realize that was a mistake.
She was wearing Eve's scarf.

653
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:26,157
It smelled of her perfume.
I got confused.

654
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,959
Uh... I mean...

655
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:33,431
Diane's pretty hot...
for that age group.

656
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,434
These look fake.

657
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,402
You really fucked up.

658
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:41,739
Charlie, help me.
I need sideburns.

659
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:44,731

<i>Oscar and I are lovers</i>

878
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,045
What?

879
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:24,114
What? Are you drunk?

880
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:27,217
Oscar, just relax.
I saw them in the mirror.

881
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:30,554
I just hope Miranda Spear
didn't see it, too.

882
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,989
Dad, there is no Miranda Spear.

883
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:34,891
There is no Mir...
What are you talking about?

884
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:36,059
I just shook hands
with her father.

885

<i>Last night?</i>

886
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,625
Mm-hmm.

Stanley...

888
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:44,734
Of course, you know,
it's not that uncommon.

889
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:46,903
In ancient Rome,
fifty-year-old men...

890
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:48,638
would marry
fourteen-year-old girls.

891
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:50,340
This is not ancient Rome.

892
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,976
I am nowhere near fifty!

893
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:55,445
Well, it is all very
The Graduate.

894
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,936
Except that Oscar
hasn't graduated.

896
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,069

897
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:20,536
Thanks.

898
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:23,940
So, you coming to bed soon?

899
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:28,211
Uh, in a while. I just have
to finish these chapter notes.

900
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:30,145
Good night, sweetheart.

901
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,700
<i>DIANE: I just don't see</i>
<i>why you're so upset</i>

902
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,303
I'm entrusted with his welfare,
Diane.

903
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:56,873
I mean, can you imagine
if Oscar's mother found out?

904
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:58,508
She's French, isn't she?

905
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:01,912
They're not all like that, OK?

906
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:03,580
You're taking advantage of him.

907
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,482
Oh, bullshit, Eve.

908
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:07,851
Oscar's a smart kid.

909
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,686
Now, there are
some forty-year-old men...

910
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:10,987
of whom I am taking advantage.

911
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:13,790
Am I overreacting?
He's fifteen!

912
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:17,661
Well, you and I were hardly
innocent when we were fifteen.

913
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:19,629
Who went to the Jefferson
Airplane concert...

914
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:21,998
and pulled down
their tube top and...

915
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:23,934
That's different, OK?

916
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:26,736
[Laughs]
All right, that's different.

917
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:30,473
I know why you're upset.

918
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:33,243
You're upset because you know
that deep down inside...

919
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:35,111
if our situations
were reversed...

920
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:37,347
you would have done
the exact same thing.

921
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:39,683
- Don't be ridiculous.
- You would have.

922
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:43,019
With a fifteen-year-old?
Not on your life.

923
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:44,354
Not just a fifteen-year-old.

924
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:48,425
A smart, sweet,
passionate person.

925
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:51,258
You're not the only one
with something missing.

926
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:56,866
Samantha Steadman
gave Oscar her phone number.

927
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:59,669
And you let her?

928
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:01,605
He can take care of himself.

929
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:04,040
I'm not his mother.
Neither are you.

930
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,842
What is wrong
with your friends?

931
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:07,577
- Nothing.
- Jesus.

932
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:11,081
And if you hadn't met somebody
in a really long time...

933
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,316
who was very excited
about life...

934
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:16,114

a fifteen-year-old.

is just too strong to...
No. Ugh.

953
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:55,852
So that's fifteen-forty, right?

954
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:59,253
A ratio
you seem particularly fond of.

955
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:06,896
And, yes, Eve,
true passion does still exist...

956
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:08,565
and I know this...

957
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:12,365

If you had met Eve
in, say, a coffee shop...

966
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,447
would you still be
attracted to her?

967

I mean, it's not just 'cause
she's your mother, is it?

968
