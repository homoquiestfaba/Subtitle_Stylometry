1
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:33,086
- Miss Marchetta.
- Hi.

2
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:38,728
Ava, this car is so hard to get out of.

3
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,026
That's the point.

4
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,998
Anyone who ever gained baby weight
can't fit.

5
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,194
- Thanks.
- Hi.

6
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:45,269
Okay. How do I look?

7
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:47,669
- Total rock star.
- Thank you!

8
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:48,967
- Liking?
- Loving.

9
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,838
- Oh, I love it!
- Loving it.

10
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,444
- Hey!
- Hi, how are you?

11
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,468
Hey, hey, over here! Come here!

12
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,300
You girls are so beautiful, beautiful!

13
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,100
Etienne!

14
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,302
Beautiful. Gorgeous.

15
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:24,978
Finally. I thought you said five minutes.

16
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,309
Finally. I thought you said five minutes.

17
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:29,142
My fingers were going arctic
holding your Borba water.

18
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,876
- Thank you.
- Cigarette?

19
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,212
Gross. Where's Mic?

20
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,048
He's over there making out
with some 12-foot-tall model.

21
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,417
What?

22
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,414
JK!

23
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,387
- I'm sorry. I love you.
- Babe!

24
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:43,919
Mic.

25
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,390
- What up, Tanz?
- What's up?

26
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,161
Johnny from the show wants to meet you.

27
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,203
He's gonna be on the cover
of <i>Teen Vogue</i> next week.

28
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,794
You should think about it.

29
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,932
- He's gonna be at my party.
- Your party?

30
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,600
Don't you mean our party?

31
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,941
And wait until you see the fierceness
that I'll be wearing.

32
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,577
Oh, my God!
Aren't you Razz from <i>Long Island?</i>

33
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:08,050
I cried so hard last week when you
caught Teanne doing it with your dad.

34
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,451
Is she gonna kill herself?

35
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:12,116
Tune in on Wednesday night
after <i>American Idol.</i>

36
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,419
Go, groupie.

37
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,188
- You want me to sign your abs?
- Oh, my God! Yeah!

38
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,820
That would be great!

39
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,297
I love the way that you spell your name.

40
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,268
You are such a creative genius.

41
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,904
Ava, don't let it bother you. He loves you.

42
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:29,941
- He's just used to random hounds.
- Whatever.

43
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,170
I just cannot wait
until we announce our engagement.

44
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,303
You have a little smudge.

45
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:37,042
Should've used
Daddy's smudge-free lip sealer.

46
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,018
Pure beauty genius.
I love it. I will make love to it.

47
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,645
- I know you would!
- I know I will!

48
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,585
Go have fun. Eat your man.

49
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,159
- Hey, Jose!
- Hey.

50
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,990
Tanzie! Tanzie!

51
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:57,196
Come with us. Tara Reid and Fred Durst
are gonna karaoke.

52
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:00,568
You guys, if I have to hear them
do Spice Girls one more time...

53
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,140
I hate classic rock.

54
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:06,244
Tanzie! You have been
such a downer lately.

55
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,313
Yeah.

56
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,405
I'm gonna have to give you
some of my Prozac if you don't chillax.

57
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,711
Guys, to be honest with you,
I didn't wanna come tonight.

58
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,277
- I wanted to stay home and finish...
- Are you insane?

59
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,222
You know Martinique feeds everything
to <i>Us Weekly.</i>

60
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:22,522
Do you really want them writing that you
wanted to stay home on a Thursday night

61
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,530
and fill out
some weird college application?

62
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:26,929
We are the face of Marchetta,

63
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:30,059
and the face of Marchetta
does not study chemistry.

64
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,864
Babe, I'm missing you out here!

65
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,462
- Come on!
- Come on, y'all, let's sandwich.

66
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,303
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

67
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,771
Come on, y'all!

68
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,782
<i>You would be amazed</i>

74
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,067

75
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,232

82
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,536
Good luck with the girl's bedroom, Ava.

83
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,737
...with this sad excuse of a breakfast.

84
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,571
I don't even think low carb is gonna cut it
this morning.

85
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,776
I am so bloated. Can I just have hot water

86
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,013
and cayenne pepper
and maple syrup and lemon?

87
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,088
I need to cleanse.

88
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,180
- I need an aspirin.
- Me too.

89
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:09,184
Hey! Tanz, give it a rest.

90
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,661
You can't keep sitting here
watching Dad's old TiVo'd shows

91
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,732
from two years ago
for the rest of your life.

92
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:17,496
- Plus that skin show's disgusting.
- I find it comforting, Ava.

93
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,231
Oh, that's so sweet. And creepy.

94
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:24,036
Plus I gotta clear up some space here.
Mic likes me to watch all of his shows.

95
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,906
And this week,
Razz and his dad get in a fistfight.

96
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,001
Ava, give it!

97
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,172
- We're talking Golden Globe material!
- No, stop!

98
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,544
<i>Do you have the X-rated version?</i>

99
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,981
<i>No, but I got</i>

100
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,483

<i>- Yeah.</i>

- And you're ripping people off!

104
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,957

105
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,122
Oh, goodie!

106
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,142
I'll take that, thank you.

108
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:05,483
"PS: Don't forget to watch me tonight
after <i>American Idol. "</i>I love him.

109
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:10,516
- Ava.
- It's my engagement ring!

110
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,285
Thank you very much. The gate is open.

111
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,463
- It's huge.
- How romantic is he?

112
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:22,193
Look at that! He has such great taste.

113
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:26,234
- Ava, you picked that out.
- Well, yeah, but he likes it.

114
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,499
- It's huge.
- Oh, girls.

115
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:28,801
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

116
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,239
Okay, come on, come on, come on.

117
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:34,503
- You have a meeting to go to right now.
- Can't we reschedule?

118
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,344
- Yeah, can't we go tomorrow?
- No!

119
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,816
- Tomorrow.
- No, no, we cannot do that again.

120
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,750
Not reschedule. This is charity.

121
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:45,984
Oh, that reminds me. I cleaned out
my closet for your church's clothes drive.

122
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:49,653
Thank you.
Homeless people love Dolce & Gabbana.

123
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,994
Hey, babe, we love this song!

124
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,154
- Let me take this.
- Thanks.

125
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:24,661
- Thanks.
- No problem, Miss Marchetta.

126
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,690
- Thanks.
- You said that already.

127
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,962
Right.

128
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,599
Tanzie?

129
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,411
I've gotta come to the office more often.

130
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:45,946
- Hi.
- Hi.

131
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,346
- Hey.
- Hello.

132
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,150
- How are you?
- Nice blouse.

133
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:52,949
- Hi, Jasmine.
- Good morning.

134
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,651
- Hi.
- Hey, hey, hey!

135
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,818
- Tommy!
- Tommy!

136
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,955
My gorgeous girls. Are you hungry?

137
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:03,191
Let's get some food, come on.
You're too thin. Both of you.

138
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:04,530
You're too nice.

139
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:07,731
Hey, let me ask you girls a question.
Seriously.

140
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:11,239
What do you think of this tie?
It's off the chain, right?

141
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,869
- This is Rocawear.
- Rocawear.

142
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,242
- And yes, it's nice. I like it.
- Are you...

143
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:18,340
- You look very handsome.
- Rocawear? Hey!

144
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:21,985
Can I get some snacks?
I want an assortment for these girls.

145
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,182
- This is Jaden. She's our new intern.
- Hi, Jaden.

146
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,519
Nice to meet you.

147
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,726
Hey, Jaden?

148
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,395
- I love your dress.
- Thank you.

149
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,427
Maybe when I'm done with it,
I'll give it to you.

150
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:41,870
Let's go in my office.
I need to talk to you about something.

151
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,269
On the DL. Look who I have here.

152
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:45,601
- Hi, Pam. How are you?
- Hi, Pam.

153
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,201
Hello, my darlings.

154
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,144
- Hold my calls, Pam.
- Sure thing.

155
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,510
Oh, Craig is waiting.

156
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,243
- Hi, Craig.
- Hi, Craig.

157
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,943
- How are you girls?
- Good. How are you?

158
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,645
- Great.
- All right,

159
00:10:55,755 --> 00:11:00,317
let me put this as delicately as I can.
Our future is in the crapper.

160
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,558
- Thank you, Pam. You may depart.
- Why not?

161
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,823
- Very nice.
- Thanks.

162
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:12,427
There's no new product.
The truth is, without Victor Marchetta,

163
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,130
there is no Marchetta Cosmetics.

164
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,340
And, so, this is what
you're going to inherit

165
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:22,312
when you take over the company in July
and I'm no longer your trustee.

166
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:25,179
I mean,
you girls even wanna run this place?

167
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:29,116
Well, I mean, you're gonna be, you know,
doing most of the running, right?

168
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,781
Yeah, sure. Yes, yes, of course.
Of course I am,

169
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:35,691
if you keep me on.
But there is another option.

170
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,259
No, I'm okay, thank you.

171
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:48,766
Jaden? Do me a favor, would you, please,
sweetheart, and split? Go. Out.

172
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,305
Thank you.
Oh, well.

173
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:56,109
We have information that Fabiella is
going to make an offer on this company.

174
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:59,710
Fabiella? That's Daddy's worst enemy.

175
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,515
All right, just listen
to what Craig has to say.

176
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,021
I prefer very, very hard pressure.

177
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:10,359
- Yes, I'm sorry. I'm scheduling a shiatsu.
- What?

178
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,326
- What did you say?
- The offer! Fabiella!

179
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,459
Yeah, right. Okay.

180
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:22,699
If the numbers come in from Fabiella
tomorrow where I expect them,

181
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:26,341
I mean, we could pay off our creditors
and still have a unit for each of you.

182
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:29,642
- A eunuch?
- Unit. 100 mil.

183
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:34,077
And you girls could spend that cheddar
however you'd like.

184
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,711
I could finance
Mic's independent movie with that.

185
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,119
- Ava?
- What?

186
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,956
He wrote a really good script, Tanzie.
It'd be like an investment.

187
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,586
This is Daddy's legacy
that we're talking about.

188
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:48,189
All right. Chill, chill.
Everybody, chill out. Just relax.

189
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,791
We'll think about it. There's no rush here.

190
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,402
We'll take our time.

191
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,201
In the meantime,
let's go see some charities

192
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:58,299
and earn ourselves a tax credit. Come on!

193
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:03,311
We specialize in making large-print books
available to seniors

194
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:06,543
who suffer from macular degeneration,

195
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:09,280
or just plain bad eyesight.

196
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:13,523
We also offer storytelling
to the very elderly.

197
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:18,291
Yet, for some reason,
this is not considered important

198
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,524
by the federal government,

199
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,898
which is why
we're in need of private funding.

200
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:29,206
Please, help our aged neighbors enjoy
the gift of reading.

201
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,534
Thank you.

202
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,713
That was very touching.
Thank you so much.

203
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,714
We'll let you know by the end of the week.

204
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,717
- Thank you.
- We're actually gonna take off, too.

205
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,746
Tanzie remembered
she has a really important appointment.

206
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:46,422
We like the breast cancer lady
and the animal cruelty lady.

207
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:50,188
And the animal cancer lady.
The rest is all up to you guys.

208
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:53,622
- Thank you.
- Was there an animal breast lady?

209
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,561
She was first.

210
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,105
- Do you think Tommy's going to be mad?
- No. How can he be?

211
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,436
He knows we only have six hours
to get ready for the gala.

212
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,237
Excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

213
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,307
Oh, no. Am I late?

214
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,679
I thought my appointment
was in 10 minutes.

215
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:15,117
Not bad for a guy in a suit
from Men's Wearhouse.

216
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:19,256
- You're one of the charity people, right?
- Yeah. Henry Baines.

217
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:23,086
- Greater Los Angeles Free Legal Clinic.
- Medical clinic?

218
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,925
No, we help people
who can't afford an attorney.

219
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,965
Let me give you my card.

220
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:31,298
Wait. So, you don't even help people
with terrible diseases?

221
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,396
No. We help people who are poor.

222
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,933
Right, but that's not a terrible disease,
per se.

223
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,808
I mean,
they don't even have a ribbon for that.

224
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,543
Okay. I guess
I'll have to look into that one.

225
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,153
By the way, a little Preparation H
under those eyes

226
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,689
- will really get rid of the puffiness.
- Tanzie!

227
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,180
- will really get rid of the puffiness.
- Tanzie!

228
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:06,866
Here they come! Okay, let's get them.

229
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,133
Will my Sidekick fit in your bag?
Sure.

230
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,335
Okay. Well, give me your lip gloss.
I'll put it in mine, and you put it in yours.

231
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:13,570
- Okay?
- Okay.

232
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,913
Okay, <i>Us Weekly</i> and <i>People</i> are first!

233
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:21,714
We're mad at <i>Gossip Weekly</i> because of
the byline they said about me being gay!

234
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,550
<i>People Magazine.</i>
Are you excited about tonight's events?

235
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:25,817
- We are.
- We are, of course.

236
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,723
We're just so excited just to be able
to remember our father like this.

237
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,318
Well, what I want to know,
how do you stay so toned?

238
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,557
- I mean, you've got runner's legs.
- Thank you.

239
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,031
So do you!

240
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,295
- Hi, Teri.
- Hi.

241
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,392
Where's Mic?

242
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:42,031
Mic is actually in Long Beach doing
a very special episode of <i>Long Island.</i>

243
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:45,440
- Is it true you're engaged?
- Wherever did you hear that?

244
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,005
Hi, we're the Marchetta Sisters,
and you're watching E!

245
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,113
I'm so bored of this.

246
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:55,345
If you make it into <i>People,</i>
we'll sell a lot of lipstick.

247
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,423
Phoebe, how are you?

248
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,452
- There's Jacqueline.
- Who?

249
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,494
You know, Joe Tweeney's daughter.

250
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:04,857
- Jacqueline, hi!
- Hi, Tanzie.

251
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,262
- You look stunning!
- So nice to see you.

252
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:10,028
- Beautiful outfit.
- Where did you get all this stuff?

253
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:13,161
We watched that episode.
It was so great. Ava!

254
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,433
Oh, my God! We love that show.

255
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,168
- We cried.
- We all cried.

256
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,710
- We should send her some...
- Oh, look. There's Fabiella.

257
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,746
Now, remember. Be charming.

258
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,213
But don't let her think you're too easy.

259
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,045
- Okay. Hi!
- Go, girls.

260
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,311
Look at you two. So hot, I am blinded.

261
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,982
- Thank you.
- Now, about the offer.

262
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:36,455
I knew Vic a long time, and let me tell you,

263
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:39,861
we had a relationship
that was built on mutual respect.

264
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:42,160
That's why I'm here.

265
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:45,395
To see you two so grown-up in charge.

266
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:51,401
Now, I've got the market cornered
on the 35 and ups.

267
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,341
And you've got the Gen-Y crowd.

268
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,936
Together we are unstoppable.

269
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,880
Oh, I'm sorry. I just saw
one of my ex-husbands over there.

270
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:07,823
Some advice, girls.
Never go younger. Even by a month.

271
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,460
A hard bod is no substitute
for wisdom, girls. Remember that.

272
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,592
Okay.

273
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,899
- Well, well, well.
- Tommy!

274
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:23,497
A powwow of squaws. Fabiella.

275
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:28,208
I'm sorry, but I can't have you
talking business with my girls tonight.

276
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:29,780
Of course.

277
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,740
Enjoy your evening, darlings.

278
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,147
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

279
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,379
And you as well. Come along, sweeties.

280
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:39,752
- Thank God you saved us.
- Keep smiling. She's still watching.

281
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,524
<i>From his early days in the South Bronx,</i>

282
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:45,961
<i>when he brewed his cosmetics in pots</i>
<i>on his own little stove,</i>

283
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,932
<i>to the rise at the top</i>
<i>of the cosmetics world,</i>

284
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:53,494
<i>Victor Marchetta always remembered</i>
<i>the words of Winston Churchill,</i>

285
00:17:53,605 --> 00:18:00,033
<i>"We make a living by what we get,</i>
<i>but we make a life by what we give. "</i>

286
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,271
Here.

287
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,369
<i>Before his tragic death two years ago...</i>

288
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,608
- Thank you, Tommy.
- Share with your sister.

289
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,017
It's so sad.

290
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,416
<i>His first product line</i>
<i>became a huge success.</i>

291
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,953
I have raccoon eyes.

292
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,654
You should have used
Daddy's waterproof mascara.

293
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,353
- Give me that. Give me that.
<i>- Family was always a top priority.</i>

294
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,726
- Let's check out the gift bags.
- Don't.

295
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:22,096
You do not understand
that this is supposed to be sad? Okay?

296
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,226
- Show a little respect.
<i>...so important to him.</i>

297
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:29,273
<i>They've become the beautiful, charming</i>
<i>young women we see here today.</i>

298
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,668
- Smell, smell.
- No, no. Night cream.

299
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:35,008
Dang, this is like $100 an ounce.

300
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,241
Hey. You guys, have some respect.

301
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:41,979
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>please welcome Marchetta 's CEO</i>

302
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:46,547
<i>and Victor's best friend,</i>
<i>Tommy Katzenbach.</i>

303
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,661
<i>Thank you.</i>

304
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,165
<i>Thank you, thank you, thank you.</i>

305
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,236
<i>- And thank you, Charlotte.</i>
<i>- Charlene.</i>

306
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,965
<i>Charmaine. Charlene, forgive me.</i>

307
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:06,137
<i>I was fortunate to know a side of Vic</i>
<i>that few others did.</i>

308
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,145
<i>We grew up together.</i>

309
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:13,174
<i>And for that, he brought</i>
<i>the old Tom Kat along as his number two.</i>

310
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:20,124
I'm all about this phone television.

311
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,256
- Oh, my God.
- I love things in mini.

312
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:25,353
<i>Then he creates Madonna 's first look.</i>

313
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:28,392
<i>Her second and third looks.</i>

314
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:32,230
<i>Not to mention Alice Cooper</i>
<i>and Marilyn Manson.</i>

315
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,539
<i>All beautiful, beautiful women.</i>

316
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:40,835
<i>But his two best girls</i>
<i>were always his daughters.</i>

317
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:48,084
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please give it up</i>
<i>for A va and Tanzie Marchetta.</i>

318
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,187
<i>Girls.</i>

319
00:19:57,462 --> 00:20:00,659
<i>- Thanks, Tommy.</i>
<i>- You've been like a second dad to us.</i>

320
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:04,759
<i>And you know he totally got stuck</i>
<i>with all of the tormented teen-angst years.</i>

321
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,894
<i>And the car accidents.</i>

322
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,562
Let's look through the channels.

323
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:08,697
What channels?

324
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:12,299
Hey, the Game Show Network!
I love it. I love it.

325
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,938
Go to Channel 10.
The girls are on television!

326
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,810
They're on the news.

327
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,942
Hey, Mom, Dad, check out your TVs.

328
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,886
<i>We wanna thank everyone so much</i>
<i>for coming out tonight</i>

329
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,514
<i>- and honoring our father.</i>
- What is he saying?

330
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,917
<i>But what if the cosmetics</i>
<i>you trusted to make you look good...</i>

331
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:33,759
<i>We're so proud of him, and we're proud</i>
<i>to be the face of this company.</i>

332
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:36,698
Hey, put it on the screen!
Yeah, put it up!

333
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:40,133
<i>The product gave them terrible scars</i>
<i>and infections.</i>

334
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,671
<i>- While developing their night cream...</i>
- What's happening?

335
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,002
I didn't approve this spot.

336
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,269
<i>... it appears the founder, Victor Marchetta,</i>

337
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,904
<i>deliberately covered up his discovery of</i>
<i>shocking and permanent side effects.</i>

338
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,005
<i>- What's going on?</i>
- Somebody!

339
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:55,576
<i>Until I started using</i>
<i>the Marchetta Everdew Night Cream...</i>

340
00:20:57,356 --> 00:21:01,224
<i>I put it on my nose!</i>
<i>Somebody, turn it off.</i>

341
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:06,130
<i>Excuse me, turn it off. Sit down!</i>

342
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,460
<i>Don't you know how rude it is to open</i>
<i>your gift bag before you leave?</i>

343
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:16,998
Come on, come on! Hurry up!
Come on, come on, come on, let's go!

344
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:21,205
- Stop looking at that.
- This is bad! The stock's gonna plummet!

345
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,804
- I can see the headlines!
- Don't quote them!

346
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,539
What's gonna happen with the company?

347
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,585
Go home. Take it easy.
Don't say anything to anybody.

348
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:28,983
I'll take care of everything. Here. Go!

349
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,987
What are we supposed to do,
just go home and sit there?

350
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,886
Eat something. Go!

351
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:40,363
<i>Drug companies have</i>
<i>gone out of business from similar scandals.</i>

352
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,558
<i>Though, at this hour</i>
<i>we have very few answers</i>

353
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:46,627
<i>to the questions raised by</i>
<i>the chilling images, one thing is certain.</i>

354
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,804
<i>For two of Los Angeles'</i>
<i>most celebrated socialites...</i>

355
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,776
- Turn it off.
<i>...life is about to change.</i>

356
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:13,360
- What are we...
- Ava, this is so weird. We're here all alone.

357
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,429
Stop creeping me out.

358
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,003
Well, how do regular people
deal with this?

359
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:21,395
They get pets.

360
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,272
I'm getting a tension headache.

361
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,909
Where's a spa when you need one?

362
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,292
This stuff smells so good.

363
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:56,397
I mixed rose water with tea tree oil
and avocados. It's very invigorating.

364
00:22:56,742 --> 00:23:00,075
- You're good at this stuff, just like Daddy.
- Thanks.

365
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,978
You're lucky you have a real skill.
Unlike <i>moi.</i>

366
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,448
- Ava!
- What?

367
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:09,981
- You have skills. Tons of them.
- Like?

368
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:13,351
Like commanding a room, for one.

369
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:17,124
You can get people to do anything for you.

370
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:21,259
- I think one day you could run Marchetta.
- Don't say Marchetta.

371
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,834
I never want to hear
about that company again.

372
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:26,961
You know, I don't think
Dad did anything wrong.

373
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:31,205
Maybe in a couple of days
this will all just die down.

374
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:34,710
Yeah, maybe. That feels so great.

375
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:38,806
There's nothing I love better
than getting my temples rubbed.

376
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,181
Except new shoes.

377
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,379
What was that?

378
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:50,385
There they are!

379
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:53,055
People. They're throwing things up here.

380
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,164
So much for this dying down.

381
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,935
I'm never gonna get into a college now.

382
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:05,571
Not everything is always about you,
Tanzie.

383
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:08,703
No, it never is!
Unless it's you telling me what to do, Ava!

384
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,941
All I do is try to help you!
And you know what?

385
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,483
- Sometimes it gets so annoying!
- You know what?

386
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:17,521
Don't even give me that
older-sister martyr act, okay?

387
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:17,956
- Ava!
- What?

388
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:18,980
- Ava!
- What?

389
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,684
- I don't wanna hear it, okay?
- Ew. Stop it!

390
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:25,194
Why don't you just go open a window
if the smoke bothers you so much?

391
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,322
And then you can see
how much everybody loves us.

392
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:29,923
- Stop it. Stop smoking! Stop, stop!
- Tanzie!

393
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:33,796
Shut up for a second! Oh, my...

394
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:36,135
- What did you do?
- Why'd you have to smoke?

395
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,641
You're the one who grabbed it
out of my hand.

396
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:40,142
Smother it!

397
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,371
Ava!

398
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,606
- Do something about this. I don't do this!
- I don't know.

399
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:47,549
- I don't know how to put it out!
- I don't know how!

400
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:49,718
Oh, Daddy's watch!

401
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:54,315
- My dress! Hurry, get out!
- Daddy's TiVo!

402
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,330
Call 911.

403
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:04,560
Fire!

404
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,741
Come on!

405
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:28,650
Go!

406
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:49,111
Hi. We need a suite.

407
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,273
And can you have the room service people
send up two orders

408
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,216
of your wasabi mashed potatoes
as soon as possible?

409
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,720
- We are in serious need of comfort food.
- Right away.

410
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,559
Mic still isn't answering.
Neither is Tommy.

411
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,765
So sorry.
Your credit card has been declined.

412
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,233
What? No.
This is a corporate platinum card.

413
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:14,832
It has no limit. Try it again.

414
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:27,114
- It appears your account's been closed.
- What?

415
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:30,585
Hey! What are you doing? Stop!
You know what?

416
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:31,986
I'm gonna take those scissors,

417
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,149
and I'm gonna
cut off your summer 2003 bangs!

418
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,717
- You little nasty little hotel troll!
- We are inside a hotel.

419
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,092
Okay. Everyone is staring at us.

420
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,166
Please, let's just go.
I just wanna get out of here.

421
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,632
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Craig!

422
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,794
What the hell is wrong
with our credit cards?

423
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:50,505
<i>Stop it. Oh, yeah, didn't I tell you?</i>
<i>I had to cancel all your cards.</i>

424
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,578
- No, you didn't tell us that.
<i>- The company's in trouble.</i>

425
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:58,047
<i>Everything's leveraged to the hilt.</i>
<i>That means no credit cards, no cash,</i> nada.

426
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:00,611
- We're broke?
<i>- Hey, can you hold on a sec?</i>

427
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:02,516
<i>I'm trying to swing myself...</i>

428
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,213
- He put us on hold.
<i>...on the back of Tiger Woods cart.</i>

429
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:06,790
Craig, if you put us on hold,
I'm gonna come over to that golf course,

430
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:11,123
and I'm gonna tee off on your face! Craig!

431
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:14,596
<i>One more thing. There's an emergency</i>
<i>board meeting set for tomorrow at 4:00.</i>

432
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:17,065
<i>Be there.</i>
<i>And wish me luck with Tiger Woods.</i>

433
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:19,636
I will not wish you luck with Tiger Woods!

434
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,438
- Ava!
- Come on.

435
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:24,833
Let's call Inez.

436
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:25,910
Turn around.

437
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:29,379
Man, we gotta get a better ride.

438
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,881
We can't be rolling up to the clubs
in a hoopty.

439
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:35,180
I know, man. I feel you.
Got what you got, you know?

440
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:36,310
Yeah.

441
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:47,454
- Hello, ladies. Let me help you with that.
- Thanks.

442
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,735
The keys are inside, okay?
Just try to be careful.

443
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:00,902
Thank you.

444
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:04,845
Let's go, man. Now.

445
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:07,315
At least it has valet.

446
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:11,449
I'm rich.

447
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:26,871
Inez.

448
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:27,972
Girls.

449
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,706
I'm so glad you're here. Look at you both.

450
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,808
I'm so glad you're here.

451
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:43,945
Considering we went from Tiffany's
to Target in one single night.

452
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:45,780
I make some tea.

453
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,553
Are you sure you have room for the two
<i>idiosos</i> that burnt down their house?

454
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:53,757
<i>Idiotas.</i> And you are not <i>idiotas.</i>
Here, let me help you with those.

455
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:56,991
I always have room for you two here,
my babies.

456
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:01,638
- You can stay in my daughters' bedroom.
- You have a daughter?

457
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,699
Yeah. I have two.
They live with my mother in Colombia.

458
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:10,907
- Nezy, how come you never told us that?
- Because you never asked. <i>Caliente.</i>

459
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,347
Well, why don't they live here with you?

460
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:16,784
Have you ever heard
of post-9/11 immigration delays?

461
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:22,759
The <i>terroristas</i> have won.
Okay, girls. Come on. Let's go to sleep.

462
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:25,961
It's very late. It's almost 2:00.

463
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,928
You're gonna feel very comfortable here.

464
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,637
Let me fix this for you.

465
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:50,354
Good night.

466
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:01,229
It's so weird not being at home.

467
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,226
It feels weird not having a home.

468
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:21,775
Ava, why does all this stuff
look so familiar?

469
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,989
'Cause it used to be ours.

470
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:30,353
Daddy must have given it to her.
I didn't even recognize it at first.

471
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:33,259
My puppy sticker collection is still here.

472
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:36,693
My popcorn scratch-and-sniff!

473
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,332
It still smells like popcorn.

474
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:48,239
I feel like Daddy's still alive,
and he's just gonna come and save us.

475
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,836
Well, he's not.

476
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:54,144
And Mic's still not answering his cell!
His battery must have died.

477
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,918
That's really not important right now, Ava.

478
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,683
I'm announcing
my engagement tomorrow!

479
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:04,194
My life is not ending just because Dad
screwed up some dumb Everdew formula!

480
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,922
What?

481
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,824
I'm never talking to you ever again.

482
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:13,696
Fine.

483
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:33,253
Who's gonna get the light, Ava?

484
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:45,698
Okay. Time to wake up.

485
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,567
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

486
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:52,006
And here. Practice your Spanish.

487
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:56,913
I am so glad I rescued my dress.

488
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:02,251
To have lost it would have been a tragedy.

489
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:03,877
Tell me about it.

490
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:07,754
I have no idea what I'm gonna wear
to the party. I have no clothes!

491
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,955
Yes, you do!

492
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:14,020
I still have the hand-me-downs
you gave me for the church drive.

493
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:17,957
There are not too many homeless
that are size 2, anyway.

494
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,404
Okay. I'm done here. I'm leaving.

495
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:24,270
- Where are you going?
- Yogalates.

496
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:28,036
And then I'm off to Sassy Maids
to see if they'll take me back

497
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:31,673
after all these years.
Some of us have to work for a living.

498
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:36,243
Oh, and girls, please behave.
Don't burn down the house.

499
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,753
Lock the door. See you later.

500
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,293
Do you remember this? This was yours.
Do you want it back?

501
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,356
No.

502
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,401
Not bad.

503
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:53,470
Cute.

504
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:58,375
Kids.

505
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:05,643
I feel so last year.

506
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,344
Calm down. Retro's really in right now.

507
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,387
Hi. It's the red Mercedes.

508
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:17,551
- What do I look like, a valet?
- Yes.

509
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,654
Honey, there's no valet here.

510
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,786
Oh, God. I'm God's personal joke.

511
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:48,016
I think he said we need to get on the 2

512
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,324
and then switch to the 37.

513
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:56,526
And then on the 6. On the 6!

514
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:58,864
Just like J. Lo.

515
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,531
And then...

516
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,803
And then we gotta get on the 2,
but a different 2 than the first 2.

517
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:09,402
This is ridiculous.
Somebody has gotta come pick us up.

518
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:13,873
You're right. You know, friends don't
let friends take public transportation.

519
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,715
Especially the bus. Ava.

520
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:20,052
I've heard about the bus.
People pee on the seats.

521
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:23,127
- Tanzie. They don't pee on the bus.
- They pee.

522
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:30,499
<i>Yo, it's Mic. Tune in Wednesday night.</i>
<i>Wait for the beep.</i>

523
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:34,196
Mic! Baby, it's Avie. Where are you?

524
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,231
What's going on? I mean,
I've called you, like, a million times.

525
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,374
We're announcing our engagement
in, like, two hours.

526
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,805
Call me, call me, call me. Okay?

527
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,406
But don't worry about Tanz and I.
We're on our way.

528
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:50,351
Our ride just got here. Bye. Love you.

529
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,585
- Lady.
- What?

530
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:59,060
I'm not tipping you
till I know how your service is.

531
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:02,826
It's $1.35 each.

532
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:05,798
- Fine.
- I've got change.

533
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:15,603
- We're going to 273 Benedict Canyon.
- Good for you.

534
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,242
Excuse me.

535
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,493
Why do they have to start like that?

536
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,994
- It smells in here.
- I know.

537
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,967
Hey! I could feel that.

538
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:43,373
Oh, my God.

539
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:47,605
Excuse me. I am not God's personal joke.

540
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:49,712
I'm his entire comedy routine.

541
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,578
That's why in Japan,
women have their own buses.

542
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,695
Wait, wait! This isn't Benedict Canyon!

543
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,735
- Where are you going?
- No tip for you!

544
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:17,636
Why aren't there any sidewalks?

545
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:23,171
Ava, I can't do this anymore.
I've got blisters.

546
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:26,409
- And I didn't even really wanna come.
- Tanzie?

547
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:29,686
This is
my engagement announcement party.

548
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:31,812
Everybody already knows you're engaged.

549
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,255
I mean, they knew when you started
wearing that promise ring

550
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,622
and saying you guys were just friends.

551
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:39,930
Come on.

552
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:41,932
Ow.

553
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:53,505
Yeah, all right.
I'll take care of that. Yeah.

554
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:55,408
- Hi.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

555
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:01,444
- It's Ava and Tanzie Marchetta.
- I'm sorry, you're not on the list.

556
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,721
I am Mic's fiancée, okay?
I wrote the freaking list.

557
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:08,451
It's Marchetta. With an M.
You know, like Manila.

558
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,651
Yeah, I know who you are.

559
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,751
My mama used to like
to wear your lipstick.

560
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:15,855
Yeah, but I bet if she had the same skin
shade as you, she'd like the raspberry.

561
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:18,959
Mama died last year.
Maybe now I know why.

562
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:24,574
Do you know how mad Mic is gonna be
when he finds out how you treated us?

563
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:28,236
- You're done. He is gonna be so pissed.
- Look! Look, it's Etienne.

564
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:32,774
- Etienne! Etienne, hey! Etienne!
- He can't hear you.

565
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:40,722
- Go!
- Etienne, it's us.

566
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:43,919
We're outside,
and this guy isn't letting us in.

567
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:49,030
Actually, I decided not to go to the party
because my throat is a little tender.

568
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:52,227
Turn around.
I am looking at you on the patio.

569
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:53,826
That's not me.

570
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:03,812
- We're being totally dissed.
- By Etienne?

571
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:06,041
- Yeah.
- He worships us.

572
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,084
- Well.
- He was gonna go straight for us.

573
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:09,914
You know what?
He's not straight for us anymore.

574
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,682
And you know what?
Etienne's not even Brazilian!

575
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:16,055
- Ava!
- Sol! Thank God.

576
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,458
I know, baby, I know.

577
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:20,826
We've been on this bus,
and we've been hiking around.

578
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:23,627
And then this guy won't even let us in!

579
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:25,702
Just take me to go and see Mic.

580
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,363
Yeah, actually,
that won't be happening now.

581
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:32,036
As his agent,
I have to look after Mic's best interests.

582
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:37,046
And the thing is, <i>Long Island</i> is
about to squeak into the top ten.

583
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:41,881
Let's face it. You're a liability now.
So, as far as the engagement goes,

584
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:44,548
I think we're gonna have to pass.

585
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:49,455
Pass? What are you saying?
Are you dumping me?

586
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,586
Well, technically,
Mic's dumping you. Look.

587
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:54,858
I have to think long-term,
and a career choice like...

588
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:56,364
Okay. Right.

589
00:38:57,468 --> 00:39:01,529
From a business standpoint, you know,
I get where you're coming from, okay?

590
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,969
But look, on the other hand,
this was my engagement day,

591
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,474
and I risked my life to save this dress.

592
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:12,015
So, you know
what you can tell your client? Karma!

593
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:15,483
- I'll let him know. And one other thing.
- What?

594
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:17,554
We're gonna need the ring back.

595
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:28,722
You know what else?
<i>Long Island</i> is a really bad show!

596
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,162
- I hate it.
- This is a disaster.

597
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:34,595
Our sales have plummeted
precipitationally.

598
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:38,664
And the retailers have already returned
almost 90% of our shipments.

599
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,911
- Hi.
- Hi.

600
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:48,478
Hi. Sorry.

601
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:52,386
Jaden, for heaven's sake,
get them a moist towel or something.

602
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,489
- What's going on?
- Carry on.

603
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,260
Carry on. Yes, well.

604
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:01,997
Fabiella did make us an offer.

605
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:06,435
It was lower than we hoped for,
but in light of present circumstances...

606
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,232
How much is it for?

607
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,636
How much is it for?

608
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,802
Sixty cents on the dollar
for all our private stock.

609
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,277
Sixty cents?

610
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,214
It's actually quite generous.
I mean, it could go down again next week.

611
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:21,718
What?

612
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:27,686
If we sell to Fabiella,
what happens to the Marchetta name?

613
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,927
If we're lucky, we disappear quietly.

614
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:34,859
Quietly disappear?
What about your investigation?

615
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:37,559
Well, I looked into the Everdew file...

616
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:39,662
Thank you, Pam.

617
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:44,071
And I don't know how to tell you this,

618
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:47,201
but there were some problems
in the testing stage.

619
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:52,441
And your father, for whatever reason,
decided not to deal with it.

620
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,545
What he's saying
is that the complaints are legit.

621
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:57,951
I'm sorry, girls.

622
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:02,288
But, Tommy, you're not just gonna, like,
accept this, right?

623
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:06,352
I mean, you're gonna track down
those people from the story.

624
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:10,093
Yes, yes. I'm gonna try.
I threatened to sue.

625
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:13,898
- But Nakamori won't give up his sources.
- People, can we pick up the pace here?

626
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:16,598
Yes. All right, let me be frank here.

627
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,509
This company was already a sinking ship.

628
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:25,605
With this new publicity scandal,
we're the <i>Titanic.</i>

629
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:28,677
It's disfortunate but true.

630
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:34,620
And this is an excellent opportunity
for the shareholders to save their hides.

631
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,720
It's a great opportunity.

632
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:39,760
I gotta pee.

633
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,733
Yeah. Thanks.

634
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:46,232
Thank you for sharing.

635
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:53,101
Oh, my God. I am a federal emergency.

636
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,270
- No wonder Mic dumped me.
- What are we doing in here, Ava?

637
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,372
I don't know.
I just needed a second to think.

638
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:03,379
Well, come on! Let's just go in there
and vote to sell this stupid company

639
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:08,618
- that Dad totally screwed up.
- Hey, look, Daddy wasn't perfect, okay,

640
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,851
but getting things right
was so important to him.

641
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:15,432
- What do you mean?
- I don't know. I haven't figured it out yet,

642
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:20,494
but I know I want
to get my hands on those test files.

643
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:25,874
We vote no. We don't believe our father
is guilty of any wrongdoing.

644
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:30,273
The board doesn't need your votes to
pass this. Now, let's get this thing done.

645
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:32,505
I've got a plane to Maui in an hour.

646
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:35,346
All those in favor of bringing this offer
to the stockholders for approval

647
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:37,750
with our recommendation to sell?

648
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,922
- I'm going to exstain.
- Yes.

649
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,227
I will see you all in 30 days
at the stockholders' meeting.

650
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:51,801
You...

651
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:03,312
Can I get a statement?
When can I get a statement?

652
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,349
Hey, hold back!
Come on, come on, come on! Step back!

653
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:08,681
Please, people. Step back.

654
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:13,382
Sir, if you could step back
just a couple of feet. Just stay back. Guys!

655
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,185
There they are.

656
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,701
What do I press?
Come, follow me.

657
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,209
- Four, three, two, one.
- Ava, come on.

658
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:37,109
This is Brad Tibe at E! and I'm actually
following the Marchetta sisters

659
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:39,512
right here in downtown Los Angeles!

660
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,113
Come on. Hurry.

661
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:47,881
- Ava.
- I think it's broken.

662
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:49,550
You have to leave it.

663
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:51,952
- No.
- Leave it.

664
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:53,290
- No.
- Yes.

665
00:43:58,535 --> 00:44:00,332
- Rick.
- Get in.

666
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:02,837
Can I get
a statement from you?

667
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,534
- Is it true your cosmetics cause cancer?
- No.

668
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,373
Come on! Give me an E! exclusive!

669
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,512
It should be on the left.

670
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:24,956
Thanks.
You're welcome.

671
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:26,029
Yeah.

672
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:29,054
It's so windy.

673
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:33,964
- Thanks.
- Sure.

674
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:45,143
Rick, you were amazing.

675
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:47,612
We owe you bigtime.

676
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:50,082
And I never welch on a debt,

677
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:54,082
despite what you might read
in the papers.

678
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,751
Don't worry. I'll collect on that later.

679
00:44:57,594 --> 00:45:00,563
And I never believe
what I read in the papers.

680
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:01,756
Good.

681
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:13,300
Bye.

682
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:21,610
Jeez. Tanz.

683
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:26,088
- He's a parking attendant.
- He's cute.

684
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:38,999
Los Angeles Free Legal Clinic.

685
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:41,961
Hi. Remember us?

686
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,971
Can we have a word with you
in your office?

687
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:49,636
You're looking at it.

688
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,045
But this is a really
embarrassing emergency.

689
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:56,711
I'm sorry. My private suite's being redone.
It's either here or the janitor's closet.

690
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,920
Okay, we need a lawyer.

691
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,318
A free lawyer.

692
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:03,120
Wait a second.

693
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:06,293
You two want me
to work for you pro bono?

694
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:10,624
- But you're rich.
- Haven't you been watching TV?

695
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:12,861
- We're destitute.
- I don't watch TV.

696
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:16,933
Besides, you're not destitute.
I mean, come on,

697
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,066
- you've got cars and houses.
- Yeah. We sort of burned the house down.

698
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:22,008
And our car got stolen.

699
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,478
Besides, everything we own
belongs to the company.

700
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:26,105
And they wanna sell us to Fabiella.

701
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:28,207
- For only $60 million.
- Each.

702
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,250
- Obviously, we need help.
- Look.

703
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:36,620
This is a place where
underprivileged people come for help.

704
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:39,958
Not privileged people
who don't wanna sell their company.

705
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:42,528
But our privilege got taken away from us.

706
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,796
Yeah! And don't you think that it's fishy
that Fabiella wants to buy us,

707
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:48,599
and then this scandal
just falls into her lap?

708
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,370
Yeah, but shit happens.

709
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,308
I mean, it's a coincidence
that I can't pay my phone bill

710
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:56,470
on the same day
that my student loan is overdue.

711
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,275
But that's the way it is.

712
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:02,009
Look, if Fabiella wants to buy
your company, why don't you just sell it?

713
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:05,452
Then you'll have all your money,
and everything'll be fine.

714
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:07,852
Henry, money doesn't buy happiness.

715
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:13,459
- I know that. Do you?
- I don't know, but that's not the point.

716
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:14,895
The point is that

717
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:19,302
we don't want our father's reputation
to just go down in ruins.

718
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:22,831
- And we need somebody to be on our side.
- Yeah.

719
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:33,349
What it sounds like you guys really need
is a private investigator to look into this.

720
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:36,351
Well, do they have
pro bono private investigators?

721
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:40,785
No. They're actually pretty pricey.

722
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:45,653
Look, you guys might want
to look into getting a job.

723
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,263
In the meantime,
I can look into some of the legalities here.

724
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,428
Yes!

725
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:57,473
She has a degree
in Medieval Literature from Harvard.

726
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:01,277
She'll make a great addition
to your staff at Medieval Times.

727
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,868
Yeah. Happy jousting.

728
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:07,143
- Oh, God.
- Bless you.

729
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:13,052
You girls have your résumés?

730
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:16,721
We had headshots,
but we lost them in the fire.

731
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:17,961
Okay.

732
00:48:19,696 --> 00:48:21,596
Doris, do you have any Motrin?

733
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:24,196
What are your skills, girls?

734
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:29,031
We can dance. You mean, like dancing?
We're really good dancers.

735
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:31,573
No, I mean, like, can you type?

736
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:35,203
Can we type? We're good.

737
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,744
We can do, like, ten IMs a minute.

738
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:43,184
- See?
- Yeah. Great.

739
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:47,314
Listen, girls. I don't think
that you need an employment agency.

740
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:51,360
I think you girls need an
unemployment agency and a typing class.

741
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:57,122
Feel better.

742
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:03,739
I cannot believe
we didn't get our unemployment money.

743
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,570
I mean, we've never even been employed.

744
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:09,472
Shouldn't that mean
that we would get more unemployment?

745
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,012
What a tragedy.

746
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,412
Right up there with the federal deficit.

747
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:16,782
You know, maybe we should launch
a congressional probe, huh?

748
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,879
And my feet hurt so bad.
I need new shoes.

749
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,984
How am I supposed to get new shoes
without unemployment money?

750
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:27,723
Hey, you wanna try my Easy Spirits?

751
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:29,696
You know, my cousin Costanza,

752
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,634
she walked all the way here
from Colombia in a pair of those.

753
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:36,729
- Really?
- No, but they're very comfortable.

754
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,502
Okay, you guys,
enough with the shoe talk already.

755
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:41,873
What are we supposed to do
about money?

756
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,438
Well, how about Sassy Maids?
They're always hiring people.

757
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:49,382
- Ava.
- Well, I guess not.

758
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,419
But do you know what, girls?
I don't work for you anymore.

759
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:57,857
So, while I am cleaning up
after bulimics in Bel Air,

760
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:01,590
I really would appreciate
a little bit of help around here.

761
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:06,263
See you later.

762
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,546
This doesn't seem like it's doing anything.

763
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,584
This is enough to make me go vegan.

764
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:33,925
<i>It's for my boss.</i>
<i>He's in this water dispute,</i>

765
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:39,128
<i>and he wants me to find all kinds</i>
<i>of papers just from all kinds of places.</i>

766
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:48,669
<i>You know, it would probably be easiest...</i>

767
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:52,480
Wow. It is amazing what you can do
with a really good push-up bra.

768
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:54,106
We should do that, Ava.

769
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:57,050
- Do what? Start wearing push-up bras?
- No.

770
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:01,088
Become investigators.
Then we won't have to pay anyone.

771
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:04,024
You were the one that said you wanted
to get your hands on those files.

772
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:07,187
Yes. Let's do it.

773
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,795
- Investigators.
- Yeah.

774
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:22,276
Inez was right. These babies are amazing.

775
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:24,876
They're so comfortable.

776
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,148
I'm never gonna wear Jimmy Choos again.

777
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,410
Bite your tongue.

778
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:31,078
These are gonna be my investigator shoes.

779
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,453
Just gotta get my size.

780
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:46,332
- Hi, Pam.
- Oh! You girls look nice.

781
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:49,064
Really? We're wearing
our charity hand-outs.

782
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:50,671
Fantastic.

783
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:53,140
- I'm taking off. Hey!
- Hi.

784
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:55,234
- Is something wrong?
- No, no, no.

785
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:59,008
We just came to help out and see if,
you know, anybody needed anything.

786
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,845
Tommy Katzenbach's office.

787
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,613
I wish I could stay awhile,
but damage control.

788
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,554
Fabiella's on line 1.
She'd like to speak to the girls.

789
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:09,147
- No.
- Talk to her.

790
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:12,322
- I think you go.
- No, no.

791
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,021
Now she's gonna know
we're fighting about her.

792
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,189
No.

793
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:16,822
You, you, talk to her.

794
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:21,838
Hi, Fabiella.

795
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,268
How are you?

796
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:29,209
- I've been so concerned. Are you well?
- We're fine.

797
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,301
Good.

798
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:33,075
I'd like you to come to the office
tomorrow for a little chat.

799
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:35,413
Businesswoman to businesswomen.

800
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:37,350
Katzenbach, too, of course.

801
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:39,621
I'll send my car.

802
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,124
I'll see you at 1:00.

803
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:48,254
What?

804
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:50,928
- No!
- What?

805
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:52,023
- No way!
- What?

806
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:55,070
I am not going anywhere near
that crazy's office. No.

807
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,571
- Maybe we should go.
- Ava?

808
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,004
Whatever you think, you know.

809
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:01,475
- We should go see what she has to say.
- It's up to you, if you wanna go.

810
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:07,881
- Have you seen Tanzie and Ava?
- No, I think they left.

811
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:09,281
Oh, thank God.

812
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:12,321
I asked them to change that toner
in the copier.

813
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:17,018
And they said, "Why does it need a toner?
Does a copy machine have large pores?"

814
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:20,523
I think that's a perfectly
reasonable question.

815
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:30,463
<i>Necesita</i> toilet paper in last stall,
<i>por favor.</i>

816
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:39,778
Oh, I look disgusting.

817
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:47,916
- And you got super serious.
- It's a disguise.

818
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:53,422
You know, I don't know why we didn't
just ask for the Everdew test files.

819
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:57,960
don't trust anyone.

820
00:53:58,335 --> 00:54:02,328
That's true when it comes
to dating B-list TV stars and in business.

821
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:07,302
- Walk like Lucy.
- Yep.

822
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:15,042
Ava? Come on.

823
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:18,848
- Hold on, they should be right here.
- Well, they're not. So, can we just go?

824
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:20,445
Come on, I'm geeking out here.

825
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:23,788
My autonomic nervous system
is launching stress hormones.

826
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:29,130
Come on, you know the biochemistry
calms me down. Come on!

827
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:35,102
They're not in here.
Maybe they're still in Tommy's office.

828
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:36,866
Okay, come on, let's go.

829
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:50,786
Shoot!

830
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:55,183
- Ava, come on, this is nuts. Let's go.
- Hold on. Wait, wait.

831
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:57,820
Do you know how to pick a lock?

832
00:54:57,927 --> 00:55:00,418
What you think I look like,
Ma, a gang banger?

833
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:04,597
- Nice outfits.
- Rick?

834
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:07,995
- We're interning.
- Obviously, I mean, with those bags.

835
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:11,297
Your hair looks really nice today.

836
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,734
Maybe you could help us with something.

837
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:16,812
- In Tommy's office.
- All right. Let's just make it fast.

838
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:24,520
- Do you have a bobby pin?
- I do.

839
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:28,317
Thanks.

840
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:34,391
- How'd you learn that?
- I was a gang banger.

841
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:36,859
Just kidding.

842
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,467
But I did have my juvie moments.

843
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:48,537
All right.

844
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:50,840
I can't believe
I let you guys talk me into this.

845
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:53,780
You know, I could get arrested.
I could get fired.

846
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:56,781
This whole thing was her idea.

847
00:55:56,886 --> 00:55:59,719
Look, I promise
you're not gonna get fired, okay.

848
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:03,623
In fact, whenever we're in charge again,
we're gonna promote you.

849
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:06,423
We're gonna make you
head of the whole parking lot.

850
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:09,589
Parking lot? Why do you think
I work in the parking lot?

851
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:13,732
Because you park our car.

852
00:56:13,837 --> 00:56:17,136
- We don't have a parking attendant.
- Really?

853
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,806
I parked your car because I'm nice.

854
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:21,706
I'm a lab technician.

855
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:24,705
That is so cool.

856
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:28,308
Look, I'm glad you two lovebirds
are having so much fun over there.

857
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:29,885
Meanwhile, I just found all the files.

858
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:34,514
Look, Everdew Night Cream formulas,
lab analysis, test results.

859
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:37,252
And names and numbers
of all the people we tested.

860
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,055
Oh, my God. We gotta get out of here!
Come on.

861
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:41,130
What? Why?

862
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:44,292
Yo, wait! Hold on, stop!

863
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:49,029
Wait!

864
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:54,735
Why do we have dogs?

865
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:56,402
We got them last year
after all the break-ins.

866
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:57,878
We had break-ins?

867
00:56:57,981 --> 00:57:00,006
You guys didn't pay any attention
to the business, did you?

868
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:02,516
- No, apparently not.
- No, kind of.

869
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,750
- I really like chemistry.
- Get out of here. So do I.

870
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:07,447
That's why I work down in the lab.

871
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:09,821
I love it. I've actually been filling out
all my applications...

872
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,553
- No way! Where?
- Okay! Hey!

873
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:14,653
While I can really appreciate
this whole exchange of sexual banter here,

874
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:17,130
there's dogs outside
that want to rip our faces off!

875
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:18,791
Yeah, let's go.

876
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:24,940
So, are we outside the fence now?
Yes. We're safe here.

877
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:26,303
Oh, good.

878
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:28,904
- Here, take this.
- What?

879
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:32,345
- Okay, here, give me your bags.
- Don't drop that.

880
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:33,976
Hold up.

881
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:37,719
- Come on.
- These shoes rock!

882
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:40,619
I don't even feel like I'm gonna plummet
to my death at any moment.

883
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:42,418
Speak for yourself.

884
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:44,686
- Okay, I'll go first.
- What? Go where first?

885
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:47,160
- Down there.
- No! Not into the trash.

886
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:51,025
- Rick, no!
- Tanzie, no. Wait.

887
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,431
Tanzie, I am serious!

888
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:54,059
- Do not! Do not!
- You can do it!

889
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:56,138
Just pretend you're diving in the ocean
in St. Bart's.

890
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:59,675
- No, I can't.
- This is so not St. Bart's.

891
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:02,074
- Come on, Tanzie.
- No!

892
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:14,151
You caught me. I guess that, like,
makes you my hero or something.

893
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,584
You bet.

894
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:20,552
- Get me out!
- Ava!

895
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:22,255
Get me out! Grab my hand!

896
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:23,332
Are you okay?

897
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,836
Whoa. Beam me up, huh?

898
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:40,848
I smell jasmine.

899
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:42,713
We have it piped in.

900
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:46,886
- I love Century City.
- The Marchettas are here.

901
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:51,521
- Please make yourselves comfortable.
- Thank you.

902
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,996
These are so ugly.

903
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,102
Velvet. Sweet.

904
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:05,970
Remember,
we have to speak her language.

905
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:07,133
Okay.

906
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:12,079
May I offer you some coffee?

907
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:16,447
Latte, espresso, cappuccino, mocha.

908
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:20,081
Caramel macchiato, chai tea?

909
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,852
I'd kill my first born
for a caramel macchiato.

910
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,726
Honey, if you knew my first born,
you'd kill him for a lot less than that.

911
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:29,695
- You?
- I'll take a chai tea.

912
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:31,664
- Janet, make it happen.
- Yes.

913
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:36,872
Now tell me. Tell me the truth.
Are you well?

914
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:38,701
Are you truly, truly well?

915
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:40,400
Because if you're not,

916
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:44,913
I have two of the most
<i>wunderbar</i> psychiatrists on my payroll,

917
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:47,608
and I'd be so pleased to lend you one.

918
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:51,445
Thanks.

919
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:03,991
I'll have one of those expressos, Janet,
with the chocolate shavings.

920
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:11,504
It must be easy coming to the office
every day when you have a spa like this.

921
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,168
Yeah, this way no one can pack heat, huh?

922
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:18,238
Just breathe. Relax.

923
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:23,475
Now, I know things have really
sucked bigtime for you lately, girls,

924
01:00:23,586 --> 01:00:27,317
but all that's about to change.
I want your company.

925
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:30,118
I want you to make the deal.

926
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,120
You want to be a chemist? Be my chemist.

927
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:35,989
Go to any college you want.

928
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:38,834
You want to travel?

929
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:41,165
The ancient ruins of Pompeii.

930
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:44,865
The bronzed island boys
of Mustique await you.

931
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,601
Do it on my dime.

932
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:51,110
I want you girls
to be the face of my new line.

933
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:53,507
A line we create together.

934
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:57,678
But our reputations
have been completely ruined.

935
01:00:57,887 --> 01:01:00,014
Oh, I'll clear his name.

936
01:01:00,123 --> 01:01:03,092
I'll make your father a hero again.

937
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:05,219
Listen up.

938
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:09,924
My father, Morris Farbrinsky,
pulled himself up by his bootstraps

939
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:12,900
to become mattress king of Atlantic City.

940
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:15,027
Everybody called him a crook.

941
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:17,766
But his memory means everything to me.

942
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:21,266
- I know what you're going through.
- Thank you.

943
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:25,072
Oh, Tran, Bob. Hurrah.

944
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,877
Why don't you give the girls foot rubs?

945
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:39,661
Tran? Better yet,
why don't you massage Ava's temples?

946
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:53,069
Remember, girls. I can give you
everything you ever wanted.

947
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:58,773
So, maybe Fabiella wasn't so bad after all.

948
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:00,212
- Ava!
- What?

949
01:02:00,316 --> 01:02:01,943
I cannot believe you.

950
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:04,315
I mean, one temple rub and you...

951
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,444
Wait.

952
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:08,353
How psychic was she
about how much you liked those?

953
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:10,392
So she did her homework.

954
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:14,191
But that doesn't just mean
we're gonna give up and sell, right?

955
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:15,423
JK.

956
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:18,796
Well, you're gonna help me
go through these lists, right?

957
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:21,631
Yes. But if Dad did it, we sell.

958
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,296
And if he didn't, we fight!

959
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:24,534
Okay.

960
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:30,001
Out of the thousand tested,
153 people had adverse reactions.

961
01:02:30,113 --> 01:02:33,480
- So I divided up all the phone numbers.
- Okay.

962
01:02:33,783 --> 01:02:35,842
And now we start calling people.

963
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:37,749
Let's do this!

964
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:46,453
Hi, Dinah? Ava Marchetta.

965
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:51,460
Thank you.

966
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:56,135
Actually, I was calling to talk to you
about your reactions

967
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:57,706
to the Everdew Night Cream.

968
01:02:57,807 --> 01:03:00,275
You're sure your skin was fine after that?

969
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:10,749
Hi, Ava Marchetta.

970
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:14,220
I was just calling to speak with you
about our Everdew Night Cream.

971
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,271
Thank you very much.

972
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:39,510
Yes, thank you.

973
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:44,447
- What?
- That's another one.

974
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:47,817
She said her rash
was nothing like the story on TV.

975
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:51,860
- What?
- Tanzie, wake up. 92 through 103.

976
01:03:53,262 --> 01:03:55,787
Thank you so much.
Okay, great. Thank you.

977
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:58,196
- Well?
- That was the last one.

978
01:03:58,301 --> 01:04:01,498
That woman's doctor said
she had nothing but a rash.

979
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:03,765
This is crazy.

980
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:06,774
Not one person
had long-lasting side effects.

981
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:11,780
Where did Ned Nakamori
find all these victims for his story?

982
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:13,839
<i>Teanne, no!</i>

983
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:16,384
<i>What did you do, baby?</i>
<i>What did you do? Huh?</i>

984
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:19,750
<i>Oh, Razz. I love you so much.</i>

985
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:23,451
<i>- I'm so sorry I slept with your dad.</i>
<i>- It's okay. It's okay.</i>

986
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:31,023
<i>I deserve to die!</i>

987
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:34,159
<i>No! Don't you die.</i>
<i>Don't die, baby. Don't die!</i>

988
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:37,097
<i>We have to get you to the hospital.</i>

989
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:42,504
<i>- What did you take?</i>
<i>- Three-months' worth of birth control pills.</i>

990
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:47,207
Oh, hey. What are you doing here?

991
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:49,511
Thought you were the pizza.

992
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:51,644
I brought you these.

993
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:52,846
And where's your sister?

994
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:54,718
I thought you two
were borderline Siamese.

995
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:57,258
I thought you didn't watch TV.

996
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:06,163
- It smells like beef in here.
- It's the <i>carnicería.</i>

997
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:09,972
Is that why you came here?
To smell my office?

998
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,239
Ha ha.

999
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:19,646
So, interesting books you've got here.

1000
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:22,916
What is this? Pleasure reading?

1001
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:24,884
My sister works
for <i>The New York Review of Books.</i>

1002
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:27,478
So, she sends me the ones
with the funniest titles.

1003
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:30,286
And, yes, I do read them. I like to read.

1004
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,052
So, sister, huh?

1005
01:05:33,462 --> 01:05:34,690
That's something we have in common.

1006
01:05:34,797 --> 01:05:38,358
Yeah, it's probably about the only thing
we have in common.

1007
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:41,368
Well, you're awfully quick to judge.

1008
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,963
As much as I'm enjoying
your spontaneous attack

1009
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:46,166
on my character and office smell,

1010
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:48,937
would you do me a favor
and get to the point?

1011
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:52,404
Just a second.

1012
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,576
- Hey, Tanz.
- Hey! Check this out.

1013
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:59,780
<i>I compared the formula in the testing</i>
<i>to the current Everdew formula.</i>

1014
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:01,322
<i>- And Dad changed it.</i>
- No way.

1015
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:04,359
Yes way.
He took the isopropyl lanolate out,

1016
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,485
but there's no records of this in the files.

1017
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:09,828
I'm telling you, Ava,
this thing is screwier than Courtney Love.

1018
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:12,924
<i>- Okay, well, just see what you can find.</i>
- Okay.

1019
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:16,266
- You don't have a case.
- What?

1020
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:19,205
Not one of these people
had a permanent reaction.

1021
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:22,038
And then we find out
that the formula was changed.

1022
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:24,339
Someone had to have fabricated
those testimonials.

1023
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:27,348
- You don't have any proof, though.
- Yes, we do.

1024
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:28,940
- No, you don't.
- Sure, we do.

1025
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:30,575
No, you don't.

1026
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:33,919
Okay, fine. We don't.

1027
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:35,718
<i>WOMAN ON TV:</i>
<i>With us today is Ned Nakamori,</i>

1028
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:38,953
<i>the reporter who first broke</i>
<i>that story in Los Angeles.</i>

1029
01:06:39,061 --> 01:06:42,326
<i>Ned, is it true that this is the end</i>
<i>for the troubled company?</i>

1030
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:44,729
<i>Is a sale to Fabiella Cosmetics imminent?</i>

1031
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:47,132
<i>That's right, Christiane. It's expected that</i>

1032
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:50,137
<i>when Marchetta Cosmetics' shareholders</i>
<i>vote in less than two weeks,</i>

1033
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:53,697
<i>they will overwhelmingly approve a sale</i>
<i>to archrival, Fabiella.</i>

1034
01:06:53,809 --> 01:06:56,437
<i>Let's hope new leadership</i>
<i>will prevent another atrocity</i>

1035
01:06:56,545 --> 01:06:58,536
<i>like the one I brought to light</i>
<i>a few weeks ago.</i>

1036
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:03,846
<i>I always had perfect skin.</i>
<i>All I wanted was a good moisturizer.</i>

1037
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:30,868
<i>- Information.</i>
- Yes! Hi.

1038
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:33,778
I need a Los Angeles number for KLAE.

1039
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:51,566
- Hello.
- Hey.

1040
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:53,969
- What's your name?
- Gene.

1041
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:59,633
- Hi, Gene. I'm Tina.
- Hey, Tina.

1042
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:02,836
Did anyone ever tell you
you look like Tanzie Marchetta?

1043
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:05,741
- Thanks.
- You're much prettier, though.

1044
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:07,975
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1045
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:10,245
I'm sure you're a lot nicer than they are.

1046
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:13,116
What spoiled jerks.
Screwing over all those people like that.

1047
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:14,519
Hey, Gene.

1048
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:18,992
Believe it or not, I'm actually on the prowl
for some of those release forms

1049
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:22,087
that people have to sign
before they go on television.

1050
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:25,757
I mean, everyone you air
has to sign one of those things, correct?

1051
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:27,597
Yeah, that's right.

1052
01:08:27,903 --> 01:08:32,863
So, I was wondering if I could just get
a little look-see in that file room.

1053
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:36,602
- Oh, I am not authorized to do that.
- Gene.

1054
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,971
I'm gonna be in so much trouble.

1055
01:08:40,716 --> 01:08:43,742
My boss needs them for a TV emergency.

1056
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:48,048
If you could just help me
this eensie-weensie little bit?

1057
01:08:57,266 --> 01:08:59,131
You're gonna be quick, right?

1058
01:09:17,019 --> 01:09:18,577
Hurry!

1059
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:26,259
What the hell's going on in here, Gene?

1060
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:30,698
Well, well. What have we here?

1061
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:33,734
Her boss is having a TV emergency.

1062
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:37,666
Gene, you must be a stone moron.
Do you know who that is?

1063
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:40,173
- That's Tanzie Marchetta.
- No.

1064
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:44,309
You're in big trouble.

1065
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:50,049
Sorry, it's not exactly Sushi Roku, but...

1066
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:53,519
Are you kidding?
This stuff is so much better than sushi.

1067
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:55,317
You haven't had Domino's before?

1068
01:09:55,424 --> 01:09:58,951
Well, once at Brigitta's
white-trash hoedown party.

1069
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:02,087
But, other than that,
our chef always made us low-carb pizza.

1070
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,597
Good Lord.

1071
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:10,202
Look. Thanks for helping us.

1072
01:10:11,307 --> 01:10:15,209
All of our so-called friends have treated us
like lepers since this happened.

1073
01:10:15,311 --> 01:10:18,610
Yeah, I know about the leper thing.
I was a debate team nerd in high school.

1074
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:21,205
- So...
- Really? That's cute.

1075
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:25,754
- Nerds are, like, really in right now.
- Yeah? They weren't back then.

1076
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:30,082
A beautiful girl like you
wouldn't have given me the time of day.

1077
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:32,491
I don't know about beautiful.

1078
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:35,189
I gained two pounds since I've been poor.

1079
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:37,891
I used to make fun of regular people
with their eye bags

1080
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,369
and their love handles,
but worrying about money is really tiring.

1081
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:45,100
I got my first eye bag yesterday.

1082
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:48,541
You could use a little
Preparation H for that.

1083
01:10:52,348 --> 01:10:54,942
You still look pretty great to me.

1084
01:10:56,485 --> 01:11:01,286
My mom was a model, so looking great
was considered a genetic requirement.

1085
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:05,827
Where is your mom, anyway?

1086
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:09,757
She's in Europe with an Egyptian prince.

1087
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:14,668
She changed her name to Isis,
and she calls us her cousins.

1088
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:17,302
We get e-mails every few years.

1089
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:21,071
You wanna know something
really funny, though?

1090
01:11:21,176 --> 01:11:25,272
I can remember living in
this teenie-tiny little walk-up

1091
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:27,576
and being really happy.

1092
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:33,154
I mean, Tanzie doesn't remember that,
but I totally do.

1093
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:39,316
You're different than I thought
you were, Ava Marchetta.

1094
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:47,392
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
I was just attacked by a vermin!

1095
01:11:47,503 --> 01:11:48,527
What happened?

1096
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:52,038
I can feel it! Get it off me! I hate rats!

1097
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:55,508
- That's my cat, Clarence Darrow.
- Oh, whatever! It was vomitous!

1098
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:58,307
- I hate cats!
- Well, excuse me!

1099
01:11:58,414 --> 01:12:01,178
- What? You think I'm overreacting?
- He's a cat!

1100
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:02,545
He looks like he has rabies!

1101
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,141
- Come on.
- How can you stand this?

1102
01:12:04,253 --> 01:12:05,686
This is like an episode of <i>Fear Factor!</i>

1103
01:12:05,788 --> 01:12:08,780
I'm sorry I don't live in a mansion
and have a Chihuahua with a pedicure.

1104
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:10,620
And, what,
because you work in a cesspool,

1105
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:12,125
you think you're like Gandhi or something?

1106
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:15,025
What about you?
You're all frosting and no cupcake.

1107
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:20,261
I am cupcake! Okay?
And you are pretentious and sloppy.

1108
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:23,998
Thank God I didn't kiss you!
You would've needed a tetanus shot.

1109
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:26,434
Because I would have let you kiss me.

1110
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:29,375
You were practically in my lap.

1111
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:32,811
- I was reaching for more pizza.
- Sure, you were.

1112
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:35,884
I was! And you know what?
You can't talk to me like that.

1113
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:39,317
You know why?
You work for me. You're fired.

1114
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:42,481
You can't fire me.
I'm helping you out for free.

1115
01:12:43,425 --> 01:12:45,416
You're still fired.

1116
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:51,299
What! Hello? What?

1117
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:09,743
- Hi.
- Hey, Sue, check it out.

1118
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:12,480
Looks like one of them
fancy prostitutes from

1119
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:15,921
<i>the Promenade Hotel</i>
<i>got herself cold busted.</i>

1120
01:13:16,658 --> 01:13:18,853
<i>- No. I'm not a hooker.</i>
<i>- Come on.</i>

1121
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:22,920
<i>Not that I don't respect</i>
<i>your entrepreneurial spirits.</i>

1122
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:25,625
<i>It's just that... I don't really...</i>
<i>It's not my thing. You know?</i>

1123
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:28,496
In fact, it's really a personal failing
on my part.

1124
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:31,334
You know, 'cause if I could
just get myself more organized...

1125
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:34,375
- You got some soft skin.
- Yeah.

1126
01:13:34,476 --> 01:13:37,343
It's like a baby's. How you do that?

1127
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:44,179
<i>Tanzania Marchetta.</i>
<i>Trespassing and attempted theft.</i>

1128
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:49,223
<i>- That's $20,000 bail.</i>
<i>- $20,000!</i>

1129
01:13:49,691 --> 01:13:52,888
<i>What kind of criminal has $20,000?</i>

1130
01:13:52,995 --> 01:13:54,860
<i>What is wrong with the justice system?</i>

1131
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:56,521
<i>It ought to be peanuts for you, missy.</i>

1132
01:13:56,632 --> 01:13:56,965
You know what? Henry, stop!
You can't drag me away like that, Henry.

1133
01:13:56,965 --> 01:14:00,526
You know what? Henry, stop!
You can't drag me away like that, Henry.

1134
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:01,625
And you know what else?

1135
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:04,171
The only reason that you're still here
is because Tanzie's in jail!

1136
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:06,468
Ava, there's a bail bondsman
around the corner.

1137
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:08,202
And what?
He's just gonna give me the money?

1138
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:11,507
No, he'll loan you the money.
You just have to give him some collateral.

1139
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:13,740
I don't have any collateral.

1140
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:21,048
- But that's my dad's watch.
- It's your sister, Ava.

1141
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:27,752
Sorry, Rolie. Time for you to go.

1142
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:32,357
Okay, the key to soft skin like mine
is exfoliation.

1143
01:14:33,368 --> 01:14:35,563
Exfoliation.

1144
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:37,832
- Exfoliation.
- Exfoliation.

1145
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:39,338
Yes.

1146
01:14:39,441 --> 01:14:43,468
Now, Laporscha, all of that makeup
is really hard on your skin.

1147
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:46,808
You need to be kinder to your pores.

1148
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:51,181
If only we had some kind of a scrub.
Something fine but grainy and...

1149
01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:54,847
Oh! I got an egg roll in my bra.
Just give me a minute.

1150
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:56,985
That's okay.

1151
01:14:57,092 --> 01:15:01,552
I got sand all up in my toe jam
running from the po-po.

1152
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:02,687
Great.

1153
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:06,631
Anything abrasive like this
will really get rid of those dead cells.

1154
01:15:06,735 --> 01:15:10,296
Okay, you want to use natural
hypoallergenic ingredients on your skin.

1155
01:15:10,405 --> 01:15:12,464
Stay away from formaldehyde.

1156
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:14,439
You don't even want to know
how much formaldehyde

1157
01:15:14,543 --> 01:15:17,068
a woman swallows a year
just from her lip gloss.

1158
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:21,639
Okay, you want to use, like, sea kelp,
oatmeal, natural lactic acid.

1159
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:24,548
Girl, we can't afford nothing
but the cheap stuff.

1160
01:15:24,653 --> 01:15:27,679
And nothing that costs two bucks is gonna
make your skin feel this good.

1161
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:31,054
Yeah, if they just sold something
like that at the Rite Aid, huh?

1162
01:15:31,827 --> 01:15:36,560
- Tanzania Marchetta? You made bail.
- Really?

1163
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:39,532
But we were just getting ready
to start a book club.

1164
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:54,977
- How'd you get so good at this?
- Practice.

1165
01:15:58,053 --> 01:15:59,850
How dare you sneak in like that?

1166
01:15:59,955 --> 01:16:02,185
What in the world are you wearing?

1167
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:04,452
- No wonder you ended up in jail.
- No!

1168
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,825
Girls, you're gonna drive me crazy.

1169
01:16:08,597 --> 01:16:13,398
You smell like Satan's armpit.
Go wash those things off! Go!

1170
01:16:13,502 --> 01:16:15,902
And you. Come here, young lady!
Where do you think you're going?

1171
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:19,167
Who do you think you are,
calling me and leaving a message?

1172
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:22,471
"Oh, Nezy, well, Tanzie's in jail,
but don't worry."

1173
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:24,045
Don't worry?

1174
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:26,546
- You almost gave me a heart attack!
- I'm sorry!

1175
01:16:26,648 --> 01:16:28,377
I didn't know
you were gonna be so worried.

1176
01:16:28,483 --> 01:16:30,383
What? Are you crazy?

1177
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:32,851
Who am I, if not your mother?

1178
01:16:32,955 --> 01:16:35,822
You're the one always telling us
that we act spoiled all the time

1179
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,324
and that we don't appreciate you.

1180
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:43,522
That's what mamas do.

1181
01:16:44,967 --> 01:16:48,698
- Don't you understand?
- I'm sorry, Nezy.

1182
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:52,030
I am. I'm sorry.

1183
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:58,306
You know, apart from my own two girls,
you're everything to me.

1184
01:16:58,413 --> 01:16:59,573
I know that.

1185
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:02,206
And I would never let you suffer.

1186
01:17:03,852 --> 01:17:08,346
- I love you.
- Nezy, we love you, too.

1187
01:17:11,593 --> 01:17:13,185
Look at you.

1188
01:17:15,664 --> 01:17:18,929
You remind me so much like your father.

1189
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:22,662
He was a very good man.

1190
01:17:25,107 --> 01:17:27,837
And he was gonna
bring my girls over here.

1191
01:17:27,943 --> 01:17:28,910
He was?

1192
01:17:30,846 --> 01:17:34,805
I wanna help you with that.
I wanna finish what he started.

1193
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:40,977
Hey!

1194
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:42,824
Could someone come and help me in here?

1195
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:45,616
The tattoo that Butch Brenda gave me
isn't coming off.

1196
01:17:45,727 --> 01:17:47,422
She said it was henna!

1197
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:58,164
Rural route 17.

1198
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:02,032
- How ghetto is that?
- This was your idea, Tanz.

1199
01:18:03,078 --> 01:18:04,045
Pothole.

1200
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:05,771
Told you we should've gotten the Beamer.

1201
01:18:05,881 --> 01:18:08,179
And I told you too expensive.

1202
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:12,015
Someone's been hanging out
with Henry a little too long.

1203
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:17,717
- Look, I went over there for help. For us.
- Yeah. You want him, Avie.

1204
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:20,551
Well, what about you?

1205
01:18:20,662 --> 01:18:24,393
You and Rick practically, like,
jump each other every time you see him.

1206
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:27,461
Admit it, Tanz. You think he's hot.

1207
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:30,663
- I'll admit it when you admit it.
- So, you admit it?

1208
01:18:30,772 --> 01:18:32,034
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

1209
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:33,732
Well, then, you did, too.

1210
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:40,506
Ava, I like Henry a lot more than I like Mic.

1211
01:18:42,017 --> 01:18:43,985
The thing I like about Henry is...

1212
01:18:44,086 --> 01:18:48,182
I mean, you know,
assuming that he ever talks to me again.

1213
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:52,157
- What?
- He takes me seriously. You know?

1214
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:56,822
Like Daddy did. And I used to resent that.

1215
01:18:57,632 --> 01:18:58,860
And I used to think, you know,

1216
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:02,698
all he wants me to do is be good
at everything and take care of you.

1217
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:07,741
But, now I think, wow!
You know, he really believed in me.

1218
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:15,178
Sometimes I wish Dad had've been
a little bit harder on me.

1219
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:17,649
- You do?
- Yeah.

1220
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:19,744
But look at you now, Tanz.

1221
01:19:19,855 --> 01:19:23,188
I mean, you're the one that got the clue
that's gonna get us out of this.

1222
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:25,691
And then you're gonna go off to UCLA,
and you are gonna be

1223
01:19:25,794 --> 01:19:29,025
the most genius chemistry major
that they've ever had.

1224
01:19:30,532 --> 01:19:32,523
Do you mean it? Really?

1225
01:19:32,634 --> 01:19:35,626
And, like, you know,
the hottest chemistry major, too!

1226
01:19:35,737 --> 01:19:37,261
You know.

1227
01:20:44,973 --> 01:20:46,374
Margo Thorness?

1228
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:50,868
So, after I had
those awful, awful side effects

1229
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:52,469
with the Everdew Night Cream,

1230
01:20:52,914 --> 01:20:56,372
the company offered to pay
for my reconstructive surgery.

1231
01:20:57,252 --> 01:20:59,720
- They did?
- Yes, ma'am.

1232
01:21:00,889 --> 01:21:04,154
Did you happen to have
any skin problems before?

1233
01:21:04,259 --> 01:21:07,228
Oh, no. No, ma'am.

1234
01:21:07,762 --> 01:21:11,493
It's funny, then, that I saw you
on the eczema documentary on KLAE.

1235
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:14,965
Oh, that?

1236
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:18,938
Well, see, at the time, I didn't know
it was the Everdew causing the problem.

1237
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,804
- So, I went to see a whole lot of doctors.
- I see.

1238
01:21:24,613 --> 01:21:26,080
Do you happen to have
any pictures of yourself

1239
01:21:26,181 --> 01:21:29,275
- before you had the reactions?
- No. I...

1240
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:33,480
You know, I'm a shy, delicate flower.

1241
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:37,514
I really don't like being photographed.

1242
01:21:38,126 --> 01:21:41,459
But you have all these pictures of you.
With all your cats.

1243
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:46,466
Yeah, but...
You know, that's more for my cats.

1244
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:48,493
Really?

1245
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:53,833
Oh, my! I need to get to church!

1246
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:56,809
- On a Wednesday?
- Yes, sugar pie.

1247
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:57,970
I run a Bible study,

1248
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:00,570
so I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to ask y'all to leave.

1249
01:22:00,682 --> 01:22:01,649
Now!

1250
01:22:02,951 --> 01:22:06,216
Does she think that we're complete idiots?
She was so full of it.

1251
01:22:06,321 --> 01:22:09,449
I saw her face, and you know what?
That was not an allergic reaction.

1252
01:22:09,557 --> 01:22:12,993
- That is severe eczema scarring.
- Tanz, we're screwed.

1253
01:22:13,395 --> 01:22:15,886
- What are you talking about?
- We don't have any time left.

1254
01:22:15,997 --> 01:22:20,127
- And we have no proof.
- We paid for those surgeries.

1255
01:22:20,235 --> 01:22:22,931
- We can find those records.
- Look, it doesn't even matter.

1256
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:26,906
The vote is on Saturday.
It's over. It's done!

1257
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:29,499
- You're just gonna give up like that?
- Yes!

1258
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:32,637
This is not fair! It's not right!

1259
01:22:32,747 --> 01:22:36,683
The world doesn't care, Tanz. Okay?
Would you just grow up?

1260
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:38,047
God.

1261
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:44,617
Bite me! Could this get any worse?

1262
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:47,526
We could die here.

1263
01:22:48,897 --> 01:22:51,889
You tell your friend Margo
if I catch one of her mangy cats

1264
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,596
spraying on my Vee-Dub one more time,
I'm setting the damn cat on fire!

1265
01:22:56,705 --> 01:22:58,798
You hear me? On fire!

1266
01:22:58,907 --> 01:23:02,240
- Oh, my God!
- Sick! I hate cats!

1267
01:23:02,344 --> 01:23:05,336
- Sir! Hey, sir!
- Tanz, wait!

1268
01:23:06,414 --> 01:23:10,180
- How long has Margo lived there?
- She grew up here with her mama.

1269
01:23:10,285 --> 01:23:13,118
Thank the Lord
she finally got her face fixed.

1270
01:23:13,221 --> 01:23:16,088
That Big Dipper mark scared me to death.

1271
01:23:16,191 --> 01:23:18,523
It did look like the Big Dipper.
That's what I said! Remember...

1272
01:23:18,626 --> 01:23:20,025
Priorities, Tanz.

1273
01:23:20,128 --> 01:23:24,462
- Excuse me? When did she get that mark?
- She was born with it.

1274
01:23:27,602 --> 01:23:30,332
That is lovely, sir! Just lovely.

1275
01:23:31,373 --> 01:23:35,537
- Can we get a jump?
- Sure.

1276
01:23:36,378 --> 01:23:38,471
Wait until Tommy hears
about this Margo stuff!

1277
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:40,480
- Screw Tommy.
- What do you mean?

1278
01:23:40,582 --> 01:23:43,779
You and I are taking care of ourselves
from now on.

1279
01:23:43,885 --> 01:23:45,250
Tommy hasn't done jack.

1280
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:48,322
All he's gonna do
is tell us that we need proof.

1281
01:23:48,423 --> 01:23:52,018
You know what? He wants proof? Fine.

1282
01:23:52,127 --> 01:23:53,185
You and I are gonna get it.

1283
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:56,526
Red leather, yellow leather.
Red leather, yellow leather.

1284
01:23:56,631 --> 01:23:58,531
Ned Nakamori?

1285
01:23:58,633 --> 01:24:03,661
Well, well, well.
Ava and Tanzie Marchetta in the flesh.

1286
01:24:03,805 --> 01:24:04,039
- What can I do you for?
- Well, have we got a scoop for you.

1287
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:07,531
- What can I do you for?
- Well, have we got a scoop for you.

1288
01:24:07,642 --> 01:24:09,667
Wait, let me guess. It was a hoax, right?

1289
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:13,236
Darling, I hear that from all my busts.
Everyone's innocent.

1290
01:24:13,348 --> 01:24:16,010
Sorry, I'm busy.
We're about to go to national feed.

1291
01:24:16,117 --> 01:24:18,984
Are you too busy to hear
about a high-powered CEO

1292
01:24:19,087 --> 01:24:20,748
involved in stock fraud?

1293
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:23,790
- You'll get the exclusive.
- Yeah.

1294
01:24:24,859 --> 01:24:28,386
All we need is just
this one teenie-tiny little thing.

1295
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:37,671
You're a regular Martha Stewart.
Well, except for the going to jail part.

1296
01:24:38,039 --> 01:24:39,404
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

1297
01:24:39,507 --> 01:24:42,408
- I'm sorry. I...
- More than anything in my whole life.

1298
01:24:43,678 --> 01:24:47,671
- And my office isn't too embarrassing?
- Absolutely not.

1299
01:24:47,782 --> 01:24:51,343
Besides, there's something
really comforting about this place.

1300
01:24:51,686 --> 01:24:54,382
I even came close
to petting Clarence Darrow today.

1301
01:24:54,489 --> 01:24:57,185
Wow. That's a big step.

1302
01:24:57,392 --> 01:25:01,089
And I was wrong about you.
You are cupcake.

1303
01:25:02,397 --> 01:25:05,332
Will you guys just kiss already
and get it over with?

1304
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:11,234
- Well, hello, hello!
- Hello?

1305
01:25:11,339 --> 01:25:14,797
Oh, cheese. Nice touch.

1306
01:25:14,909 --> 01:25:18,242
- I understand we're celebrating a merger.
- Great!

1307
01:25:18,913 --> 01:25:21,177
- Hi. How are you?
- We'll get together.

1308
01:25:21,282 --> 01:25:24,376
- Tommy, this is our attorney Henry.
- Henry. Pleasure.

1309
01:25:24,486 --> 01:25:27,080
- How are you?
- And this is Craig.

1310
01:25:27,188 --> 01:25:31,090
I love you very much. I'll talk to you later.
Hey, nice to meet you.

1311
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:33,950
- Hi.
- Hi.

1312
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:36,394
Tommy let me come
as his secretary today.

1313
01:25:36,898 --> 01:25:39,162
Pam's sick. Isn't that awesome?

1314
01:25:39,567 --> 01:25:40,591
Your nose.

1315
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:44,497
- It looks kind of like mine.
- Thanks.

1316
01:25:44,906 --> 01:25:46,874
You were my inspiration.

1317
01:25:49,744 --> 01:25:53,510
<i>Buongiorno,</i> chicklets. I'm over the moon.

1318
01:25:53,615 --> 01:25:55,879
- This is Nelson, my attorney.
- Fabiella.

1319
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:57,110
- Tanzie.
- I'm delighted you're here.

1320
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:59,709
- Nelson. Tommy Katzenbach.
- Good to see you.

1321
01:25:59,854 --> 01:26:00,821
- How are you?
- Hi.

1322
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:03,249
- Cheese?
- Thank you, no.

1323
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:05,826
No, no, no. Bad for the complexion.

1324
01:26:06,628 --> 01:26:09,791
- What is this place?
- This is our lawyer's office.

1325
01:26:09,898 --> 01:26:11,695
Bravo on the cost-cutting measure.

1326
01:26:11,799 --> 01:26:14,495
I always say, "Never spend
too much money on a lawyer.

1327
01:26:14,602 --> 01:26:17,070
"They always gouge you in the end."

1328
01:26:17,705 --> 01:26:20,401
I'm missing courtside Lakers for this.

1329
01:26:21,075 --> 01:26:22,804
This better be good.

1330
01:26:23,645 --> 01:26:25,875
Why don't we just all take a seat?

1331
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:27,845
- And we'll get started.
- I'll stand.

1332
01:26:27,949 --> 01:26:29,416
I'll sit.

1333
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:37,882
Tommy, you told us all along
that we needed proof

1334
01:26:37,992 --> 01:26:41,120
to convince the stockholders
to believe in us, and you were right.

1335
01:26:41,229 --> 01:26:44,494
Our father changed the Everdew formula
after the initial tests.

1336
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:46,226
He took out the isopropyl lanolate.

1337
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:49,303
Which we chem nerds know
can cause irritation.

1338
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:53,034
Girls, I'm absolutely enthralled
by the chemistry tutorial,

1339
01:26:53,141 --> 01:26:56,474
but I'm not quite sure I see the point.

1340
01:26:56,578 --> 01:26:58,341
We tracked down one of the victims.

1341
01:26:58,446 --> 01:27:01,643
The woman that we found wasn't scarred
by Everdew Night Cream.

1342
01:27:01,749 --> 01:27:04,684
She was born with a skin disease.
She lied.

1343
01:27:04,786 --> 01:27:07,755
And we found her with perfect skin,

1344
01:27:07,855 --> 01:27:11,222
thanks to the plastic surgeries
that Marchetta paid for.

1345
01:27:11,326 --> 01:27:12,918
Wait a minute.
How come I didn't know about this?

1346
01:27:13,027 --> 01:27:14,858
Why didn't you explain this to us,
Katzenbach?

1347
01:27:14,963 --> 01:27:17,727
What? This is the first I've heard of it.

1348
01:27:19,167 --> 01:27:23,627
Well, this has been quite a hoot, girls,
but I've got a company to run.

1349
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:26,332
When you're ready to talk merging,
I'll take your call.

1350
01:27:26,441 --> 01:27:27,465
Hold it!

1351
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:30,544
We also found the canceled checks
from all of the surgeries,

1352
01:27:30,645 --> 01:27:33,239
paid for out of our personal accounts.

1353
01:27:34,482 --> 01:27:37,076
No wonder we were overdrawn, Craig.

1354
01:27:38,653 --> 01:27:41,713
We also found the anonymous package
sent to Ned Nakamori.

1355
01:27:43,391 --> 01:27:45,018
It came from you, Fabiella.

1356
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,887
You don't think I'm so desperate
for this company that I'd plant evidence?

1357
01:27:48,997 --> 01:27:51,693
Fabiella, don't say one more word.

1358
01:27:53,501 --> 01:27:56,664
You're right. Someone did plant evidence.

1359
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:59,899
- But it wasn't Fabiella.
- It wasn't?

1360
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:03,143
Ask yourself this, Nelson.

1361
01:28:03,244 --> 01:28:06,145
Who would have access
to all of the Everdew test results,

1362
01:28:06,247 --> 01:28:08,943
or access to our personal bank accounts?

1363
01:28:13,588 --> 01:28:15,385
Tommy, our trustee.

1364
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:17,082
- What?
- What? What?

1365
01:28:17,759 --> 01:28:21,593
The messenger slip you signed.
You put the Marchetta zip code.

1366
01:28:22,597 --> 01:28:23,586
In your handwriting.

1367
01:28:30,738 --> 01:28:32,603
Girls, you know I'd never...

1368
01:28:32,707 --> 01:28:35,835
Can it, Katzenbach. You set me up.

1369
01:28:35,943 --> 01:28:38,173
You said you could get me Marchetta
on the cheap.

1370
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:41,442
And I said, "Spare me the details
and make it happen."

1371
01:28:41,549 --> 01:28:46,213
So what? I'm a little bit of a criminal,
but, hey, it's business.

1372
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:49,381
Daddy didn't leave you his company,
so you decide to steal it?

1373
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:52,323
You devalued our stock
and you framed Fabiella.

1374
01:28:52,427 --> 01:28:55,919
You'll be facing some
major SEC violations, Mr. Katzenbach.

1375
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:59,363
Katzenbach, you wannabe player.

1376
01:28:59,467 --> 01:29:02,698
Trying to step to these babies
like a cheap soothsayer.

1377
01:29:02,804 --> 01:29:05,534
But you've been kicked to the curb,
and your time is up.

1378
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:09,303
So, you gonna find yourself begging
with a little tin cup.

1379
01:29:12,046 --> 01:29:13,946
All right! So what?

1380
01:29:14,048 --> 01:29:16,642
You girls would have been set for life!

1381
01:29:16,751 --> 01:29:19,345
I built this company, too, you know?

1382
01:29:19,454 --> 01:29:22,946
Is it my fault that
I'm not some genius chemist

1383
01:29:23,057 --> 01:29:26,117
makeup man
that all the babes are hot for?

1384
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:35,069
Bravo, girls. You deserve your company.

1385
01:29:35,169 --> 01:29:39,503
Round one to you. I'm impressed.
You may be heavyweights yet.

1386
01:29:42,877 --> 01:29:44,037
Oh, my...

1387
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:48,140
Chairman Tweeney,
I hope I'm not overstepping my bounds

1388
01:29:48,249 --> 01:29:50,410
in asking to fire Mr. Katzenbach.

1389
01:29:50,518 --> 01:29:52,782
- Fire?
- Effective immediately.

1390
01:29:53,788 --> 01:29:56,313
Not at all, Ms. Marchetta.

1391
01:30:01,829 --> 01:30:05,731
Sweeties? Have a little simphatico, huh?

1392
01:30:07,468 --> 01:30:11,700
All I ever wanted
was an office in Century City.

1393
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,219
Your attorney's here, and Mic's on line 1.

1394
01:30:29,323 --> 01:30:32,622
I'm sure he's looking for a job
now that he's been killed off <i>Long Island.</i>

1395
01:30:32,727 --> 01:30:35,218
Take a message,
and also these have all been approved.

1396
01:30:35,329 --> 01:30:36,796
Thanks, Jaden.

1397
01:30:37,331 --> 01:30:39,993
- Hey, sexy.
- Hey, Counselor.

1398
01:30:44,839 --> 01:30:48,536
Did I ever tell you
you look so great in Men's Wearhouse?

1399
01:30:48,643 --> 01:30:52,511
Come on, it's Nordstrom's. Sales rack.

1400
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:06,717
More carotene oil.
We want nourishment with staying power.

1401
01:31:07,428 --> 01:31:11,694
I'm going like baby's-butt softness here.
And affordability.

1402
01:31:12,066 --> 01:31:14,830
- Good call, freshman.
- Thank you.

1403
01:31:35,189 --> 01:31:37,089
Good night.

1404
01:31:37,258 --> 01:31:39,351
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, Mama.

1405
01:32:00,548 --> 01:32:02,846
- You caught me.
- You bet.

1406
01:32:06,888 --> 01:32:08,048
That's not me.

1407
01:32:08,155 --> 01:32:10,123
<i>- I'm looking at you on the patio.</i>
- Duck!

1408
01:32:10,424 --> 01:32:12,324
I don't know what you're talking about.

1409
01:32:12,426 --> 01:32:13,757
- That's not me.
- Run!

1410
01:32:13,861 --> 01:32:17,456
- Give me that!
- Why don't you go open the window?

1411
01:32:17,565 --> 01:32:20,557
If the smoke bothers you so much
then maybe you can...

1412
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:23,667
I could taste it all in there.

1413
01:32:24,272 --> 01:32:26,172
Sorry. Don't do that.

1414
01:32:27,308 --> 01:32:29,401
All in... All in favor...

1415
01:32:31,178 --> 01:32:34,204
- All in favor of bringing...
- All in favor...

1416
01:32:37,518 --> 01:32:39,748
You told me
you could get Marchetta on the cheap.

1417
01:32:39,854 --> 01:32:42,448
And I said, "Spare me the details.

1418
01:32:42,757 --> 01:32:46,193
"Go ahead. Do it. Make my day."

1419
01:32:47,228 --> 01:32:50,823
But you been kicked to the curb.
Your time is up.

1420
01:32:50,932 --> 01:32:53,662
And I even forgot my line.
So whassup, whassup, whassup?

1421
01:32:53,768 --> 01:32:56,703
- Exfoliation.
- Exfoliation.

1422
01:32:56,804 --> 01:33:00,934
Yes! Now, LaFonda. LaFonda!

1423
01:33:01,442 --> 01:33:05,242
- I need something fine but grainy...
- Oh, I got a bagel in my bra.

1424
01:33:05,346 --> 01:33:07,906
- Just give me a minute.
- I can't look at your face.

1425
01:33:08,015 --> 01:33:09,346
Something fine but grainy.

1426
01:33:09,450 --> 01:33:12,851
Oh! I got a chunky
peanut butter sandwich in my bra.

1427
01:33:12,954 --> 01:33:15,946
- Just give me a minute.
- No, my gosh.

1428
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:21,588
I got a tube of toothpaste in my bra.
Just give me a minute.

1429
01:33:21,762 --> 01:33:22,990
That's okay.

1430
01:33:23,097 --> 01:33:25,861
Something fine and grainy...

1431
01:33:25,967 --> 01:33:28,458
I got a jar of maraschino cherries
in my bra,

1432
01:33:28,569 --> 01:33:30,434
if you just give me a minute.

1433
01:33:31,005 --> 01:33:32,734
No, that's okay.

1434
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:38,372
Would you just grow up, for God's sakes?

1435
01:33:46,153 --> 01:33:49,179
- This skin show's disgusting! Stop!
- I find it comforting.

1436
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:50,450
Well...
