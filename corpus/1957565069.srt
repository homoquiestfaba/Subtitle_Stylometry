00:00:10,523 --> 00:00:11,614
(birds chirping)
- [Man] Do you remember

3
00:00:11,614 --> 00:00:13,689
our trip to the Bronx Zoo?

4
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:15,835
- [Woman] Of course I do.
(gentle music)

5
00:00:15,835 --> 00:00:17,085
- [Man] Really?

6
00:00:17,953 --> 00:00:20,021
- [Woman] Yes, sweetheart.

7
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:21,797
- [Man] The chimpanzees.

8
00:00:21,797 --> 00:00:23,307
- [Woman] I said yes already.

9
00:00:23,307 --> 00:00:26,192
And no, I won't do the voice.

10
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,025
- [Man] Oh, please.

11
00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:27,858
- [Woman] No!

12
00:00:27,858 --> 00:00:28,836
- [Man] Please!

13
00:00:28,836 --> 00:00:29,669
- Oh!

14
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:31,148
(woman chuckling)

15
00:00:31,148 --> 00:00:31,981
Fine.

16
00:00:33,138 --> 00:00:34,131
Hello.

17
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:35,475
(man laughing)

18
00:00:35,475 --> 00:00:36,642
I'm Mr. Chimp.

19
00:00:37,592 --> 00:00:39,925
Come to me, other Mr. Chimp.

20
00:00:41,435 --> 00:00:44,769
I play with you, I get you, why you run?

21
00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:46,326
(man and woman laughing)

22
00:00:46,326 --> 00:00:49,030
I throw my poop at you.

23
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,489
Take my poop.

24
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:53,126
(man laughing)

25
00:00:53,126 --> 00:00:56,474

26
00:00:56,474 --> 00:00:57,503
- Hmmm.

27
00:00:57,503 --> 00:00:58,336
- Hmmm.

28
00:00:59,441 --> 00:01:00,941
I love that sound.

29
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:05,468
I could pick it out of a
crowd of people laughing.

30
00:01:05,468 --> 00:01:06,301
- Mmmm.

31
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,996
- [Woman] Do you remember
the first time we met?

32
00:01:12,996 --> 00:01:15,561
- And we were having such
a good time just now.

33
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:17,420
- [Woman] Oh, hush, you turd.

34
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,253
- Ow.

35
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:19,185
- [Woman] Oh, did that hurt?

36
00:01:19,185 --> 00:01:20,018
How about this?

37
00:01:20,018 --> 00:01:21,064
- Okay, okay, okay.

38
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:21,929
(man smooching)

39
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:22,762
Yes.

40
00:01:22,762 --> 00:01:25,377
Yes, I remember the first time we met.

41
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:28,511
How many different ways can I apologize?

42
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:30,703
You would think marrying you
was my act of contrition.

43
00:01:30,703 --> 00:01:32,370
- [Woman] It wasn't.

44
00:01:33,268 --> 00:01:34,101
- What?

45
00:01:35,585 --> 00:01:39,502
- [Woman] It was the walk
we took the next day.

46
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,918
I need you to walk, Elijah.

47
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,601
- What're you talking about, Robin?

48
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:54,684
- [Robin] Walk down the road, Elijah.

49
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:59,055
(birds chirps)

50
00:01:59,055 --> 00:01:59,888
Down the

51
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:02,314
road.

52
00:02:03,687 --> 00:02:06,770

(gentle piano music)

55
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:33,792
- We've got work to do.

56
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:35,872
(ominous music)

57
00:03:35,872 --> 00:03:38,539

(ominous music)

76
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:11,134
We've got work to do.

(door thudding)

78
00:07:20,318 --> 00:07:22,901
(wind howling)

79
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,502
Goddamn it.

80

(wind howling)

81
00:07:53,203 --> 00:07:54,870
God-fucking-damn it.

(door thudding)

83
00:08:02,063 --> 00:08:05,146

00:11:38,336 --> 00:11:41,169
(Elijah groaning)

101
00:11:42,515 --> 00:11:45,482
- [Robin] Sweetie, you
are gonna get lockjaw.

102
00:11:45,482 --> 00:11:48,058
You know that, right?

103
00:11:48,058 --> 00:11:50,062
- Like me being silent wouldn't make you

104
00:11:50,062 --> 00:11:51,827
the happiest woman in the world.

105
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:52,660
- [Robin] Oh yeah,

106
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,240
but you congregation may
take issue with that.

107
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,718
- Well, if someone had
broken off the exposed nails,

108
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,310
like she was supposed to.

109
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,576
- Oh my God, it's worse than I thought.

110
00:12:04,576 --> 00:12:06,304
Why didn't you tell me?

111
00:12:06,304 --> 00:12:07,748
- I didn't wanna worry you.

112
00:12:07,748 --> 00:12:08,691
- Oh.

113
00:12:08,691 --> 00:12:09,555
Does it hurt?

114
00:12:09,555 --> 00:12:11,763
- Only when you squeeze it like that.

115
00:12:11,763 --> 00:12:12,596
(Robin laughing)

116
00:12:12,596 --> 00:12:13,491
- [Robin] Sorry.

117
00:12:13,491 --> 00:12:14,679
What are you gonna do?

118
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,928
- I've got my first aid
kit down in the basement.

119
00:12:16,928 --> 00:12:17,761
- Oh yes.

120
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:19,957
I knew that.

121
00:12:19,957 --> 00:12:21,703
But did you?

122
00:12:21,703 --> 00:12:23,144
- What?

123
00:12:23,144 --> 00:12:24,811
- Did you?
- Did you?

124
00:12:26,909 --> 00:12:28,307
Did you?

125
00:12:28,307 --> 00:12:29,140
Did you?

126
00:12:30,636 --> 00:12:31,593
Why?

127
00:12:31,593 --> 00:12:33,166
Why did you?

128
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:33,999
What?

129
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:37,528
Where am...

130
00:12:39,432 --> 00:12:40,759
Oh, fuck.

131
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,592
Oh, shit.

132
00:12:42,822 --> 00:12:44,147
No, don't do that.

133
00:12:44,147 --> 00:12:46,846
Don't look at me like that.

134
00:12:46,846 --> 00:12:47,975
Don't look at me like that.

135
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,200
I walk, I need to walk.

136
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,200
I need to walk the path.

137
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:54,111
The path.

138
00:12:55,558 --> 00:12:56,391
Why?

139
00:13:00,552 --> 00:13:01,385
Father.

140
00:13:02,606 --> 00:13:04,226
Is that you, Father?

141
00:13:04,226 --> 00:13:05,091
Is that you?

142
00:13:05,091 --> 00:13:07,182
Forgive me, Father.

143
00:13:07,182 --> 00:13:09,590
Forgive me, I sinned.

144
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,052
I sinned, I watched...

145
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:13,712
I walked away...

146
00:13:13,712 --> 00:13:16,816
(man groaning)

147
00:13:16,816 --> 00:13:19,227
You have to forgive me.

148
00:13:19,227 --> 00:13:20,491
Let me go.

149
00:13:20,491 --> 00:13:21,954
Let me go.

150
00:13:21,954 --> 00:13:22,787
I saw...

151
00:13:23,852 --> 00:13:26,602
(Elijah huffing)

152
00:13:44,082 --> 00:13:46,499
- Don't do this to me, Robin.

153
00:13:50,722 --> 00:13:51,555
Please.

154
00:13:56,018 --> 00:13:58,601
(wind howling)

155
00:14:06,672 --> 00:14:09,339

156
00:14:15,653 --> 00:14:18,153

(man groaning)

160
00:14:55,215 --> 00:14:56,048
- Ah.

161
00:14:58,642 --> 00:14:59,809
What the fuck?

162
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:04,619
(man huffing)

163
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:09,766
Hey.

164
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:16,888
Hey, what the fuck?

165
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,287
Where the fuck am I?

166
00:15:26,103 --> 00:15:28,020
Hey, fucking answer me!

167
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:32,952
(man coughing)

168
00:15:35,128 --> 00:15:36,633
Hey.

169
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:39,216
(man coughing)

170
00:15:41,911 --> 00:15:45,398
(door clicking)

171
00:15:45,398 --> 00:15:48,861
(door thudding)

172
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:51,944
(footsteps thumping)

173
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:11,739
(Elijah sighing)

174
00:16:11,739 --> 00:16:14,822
(footsteps thumping)

175
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:27,219
- You're dehydrated.

176
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:51,140
(man groaning)

177
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,140
Not so fast.

178
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:55,722
(man gulping)

179
00:17:09,343 --> 00:17:10,926
I wouldn't do that.

180
00:17:12,036 --> 00:17:16,237
You're gonna need
something to pee in later.

181
00:17:16,237 --> 00:17:17,199
- Yo, where...

182
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,032
- No.

183
00:17:19,518 --> 00:17:20,351
Not where,

184
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:23,232
yet.

185
00:17:26,073 --> 00:17:28,406
You're gonna be hungry soon.

186
00:17:39,297 --> 00:17:41,880
(man groaning)

187
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:46,381
I wish...

188
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:51,354
If "how" had been your first question...

189
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:56,546
Two days ago,

190
00:17:56,546 --> 00:17:57,564
a mile or so down the road,

191
00:17:57,564 --> 00:18:01,284
your car went off the
side, down the embankment.

192
00:18:01,284 --> 00:18:02,924
Your shoulder's injured.

193
00:18:02,924 --> 00:18:04,513
There's a cut on your
head but not too deep.

194
00:18:04,513 --> 00:18:08,013
Your fibula's fractured but it's been set.

195
00:18:14,103 --> 00:18:16,186
- You carry me back here?

196
00:18:18,701 --> 00:18:21,557
- Bathroom's right over there.

197
00:18:21,557 --> 00:18:24,984
Fibula's not weight-bearing
but it's gonna hurt to walk on.

198
00:18:24,984 --> 00:18:26,203
A lot.

199
00:18:26,203 --> 00:18:28,953
That's why I gave you the bottle.

200
00:18:34,688 --> 00:18:38,688
I'll be back to change
the dressing on your leg.

201
00:18:39,941 --> 00:18:42,691
(fire crackling)

202
00:18:44,928 --> 00:18:45,761
- Oh shit.

203
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:09,901
(door clanking)

204
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:12,651
(lights buzzing)

205
00:19:21,825 --> 00:19:23,982
- [Robin] What do you think you're doing?

206
00:19:23,982 --> 00:19:25,156
- Don't ask me that.

207
00:19:25,156 --> 00:19:27,425
You know, this was your idea.

208
00:19:27,425 --> 00:19:29,329
- [Robin] No, no, I mean the sorting.

209
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:33,215
You know exactly what's in there, Elijah.

210
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:34,048
How is he?

211
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:34,881
- He'll live.

212
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:36,063
- [Robin] Is the fever down?

213
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,023
- He...

214
00:19:37,023 --> 00:19:38,709
He doesn't have a fever.

215
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:41,116
- [Robin] Oh, he's just a boy, Eli.

216
00:19:41,116 --> 00:19:42,699
It's not his fault.

217
00:19:46,472 --> 00:19:48,903
- We need to call the police, Robin.

218
00:19:48,903 --> 00:19:50,356
- What good would that do?

219
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,100
Another black boy in jail in the system.

220
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,933
- Black?

221
00:19:55,251 --> 00:19:58,298
- If you want this
ministry to mean something,

222
00:19:58,298 --> 00:19:59,570
what do you plan on doing about it?

223
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,487
- Not this.

224
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,907
- You thought this would
be easy, didn't you?

225
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:15,585
But I told you from day one

226
00:20:15,585 --> 00:20:19,386
what I wanted this to be, sweetheart.

227
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:20,219
Sorry.

228
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,770
(Elijah sighing)

229
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:34,250
(ominous music)

230
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,869
Hey, hey, hey, don't do that.

231
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:37,220
Lie back down, okay?

232
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,053
- Okay.

233
00:20:38,053 --> 00:20:40,398
- All right, everything's
gonna be all right.

234
00:20:40,398 --> 00:20:42,988
Pastor Frank is gonna
take care of it, okay?

235
00:20:42,988 --> 00:20:43,948
All right?
- Okay.

236
00:20:43,948 --> 00:20:45,198
- Pastor Frank.

237
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,689
- Okay.

238
00:20:51,689 --> 00:20:53,305
Young man, let me see.

239
00:20:53,305 --> 00:20:54,903
- It's okay, I promise.

240
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:56,807
He knows what he's doing.

241
00:20:56,807 --> 00:20:57,640
Okay?

242
00:20:59,903 --> 00:21:00,971
(Elijah wincing)

243
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:01,804
- Okay.

244
00:21:03,043 --> 00:21:04,081
Honey?

245
00:21:04,081 --> 00:21:06,284
I need you to put pressure right here.

246
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:07,117
- [Robin] Okay.

247
00:21:07,117 --> 00:21:08,203
- While I cut his jack away.

248
00:21:08,203 --> 00:21:10,582
- Not my jacket, man, I just
got this two days ago from...

249
00:21:10,582 --> 00:21:12,054
(Robin shushing)

250
00:21:12,054 --> 00:21:13,752
- It's okay.

251
00:21:13,752 --> 00:21:17,536
It's okay, just let him do it, all right?

252
00:21:17,536 --> 00:21:18,715
- Okay.

253
00:21:18,715 --> 00:21:20,855
Honey, put your hand right there

254
00:21:20,855 --> 00:21:23,386
and let's see what we can see.

255
00:21:23,386 --> 00:21:24,754
All right.

256
00:21:24,754 --> 00:21:26,094
Very good, young man.

257
00:21:26,094 --> 00:21:28,677
(bag thudding)

258
00:21:42,793 --> 00:21:43,626
(utensil clinking)

259
00:21:43,626 --> 00:21:46,459
(drawer thudding)

260
00:21:47,548 --> 00:21:49,215
They call you Chill,

261
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:53,718
the children that work for you.

262
00:21:55,403 --> 00:21:56,236
We met

263
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,958
once before.

264
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:01,149
You're a drug dealer in my
city, in my neighborhood,

265
00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:03,232
my church's neighborhood.

266
00:22:04,528 --> 00:22:05,864
You know this.

267
00:22:05,864 --> 00:22:07,171
We both know this.

268
00:22:07,171 --> 00:22:09,421
I'm just, I'm being formal.

269
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,077
Formal because this has to be done right.

270
00:22:15,077 --> 00:22:16,160
You had kids,

271
00:22:17,297 --> 00:22:18,483
children.

272
00:22:18,483 --> 00:22:21,771
Boys, young boys running drugs for you.

273
00:22:21,771 --> 00:22:22,827
Ha.

274
00:22:22,827 --> 00:22:26,942
We, our church, reached out
to the community, to the kids,

275
00:22:26,942 --> 00:22:30,415
to stop the drugs, to stop the violence.

276
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:32,715
To show them a different path.

277
00:22:32,715 --> 00:22:33,632
Better way.

278
00:22:35,816 --> 00:22:36,649
My wife,

279
00:22:38,144 --> 00:22:38,977
Robin,

280
00:22:41,726 --> 00:22:44,143
she insisted that we do more.

281
00:22:45,648 --> 00:22:47,315
More than just pray,

282
00:22:48,405 --> 00:22:50,072
more than just talk.

283
00:22:52,134 --> 00:22:55,232
We took care of those kids, those boys.

284
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,732
Boys injured in your violence.

285
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,512
She...

286
00:23:04,853 --> 00:23:08,088
Three years ago, she went out.

287
00:23:08,088 --> 00:23:09,846
You don't know this part.

288
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:14,483
She went out in the rain to
see one of your former boys,

289
00:23:14,483 --> 00:23:16,213
someone we got out,

290
00:23:16,213 --> 00:23:17,046
Marquis,

291
00:23:18,032 --> 00:23:20,115
gotten his life together.

292
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,303
She...

293
00:23:24,832 --> 00:23:26,999
Her car slid off the road.

294
00:23:29,747 --> 00:23:31,515
There was an accident.

295
00:23:31,515 --> 00:23:32,765
They called me.

296
00:23:36,718 --> 00:23:39,603
She was gone when I got there.

297
00:23:39,603 --> 00:23:41,131
You...

298
00:23:41,131 --> 00:23:42,381
You killed her.

299
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:49,301
She heard that boy, Marquis,
was gonna go back to the life.

300
00:23:49,301 --> 00:23:51,235
She was rushing to him,
gonna talk him out of it.

301
00:23:51,235 --> 00:23:52,318
She insisted.

302
00:23:53,754 --> 00:23:55,087
I, I couldn't...

303
00:23:58,219 --> 00:23:59,886
And now you're here.

304
00:24:09,168 --> 00:24:10,668
We are gonna pray.

305
00:24:12,713 --> 00:24:13,546
Together.

306
00:24:15,052 --> 00:24:17,179
I'm gonna save you.

307
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:18,762
That's why you're here.

308
00:24:18,762 --> 00:24:21,262
You've been delivered unto me.

309
00:24:23,793 --> 00:24:26,516
You're gonna repent your sins

310
00:24:26,516 --> 00:24:28,766
and ask God to forgive you.

311
00:24:36,626 --> 00:24:38,209
- Fuck you, nigger.

312
00:24:40,574 --> 00:24:43,324
(Chill coughing)

313
00:24:49,428 --> 00:24:50,305
Yeah, I remember you.

314
00:24:50,305 --> 00:24:52,055
So, who gives a shit?

315
00:24:53,031 --> 00:24:56,353
I ain't done shit to you or
anybody you know, so fuck you.

316
00:24:56,353 --> 00:24:58,100
And fuck your god.

317
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,068
And fuck your dead nigger wife.

318
00:25:01,068 --> 00:25:02,928
You know, the way I see it,

319
00:25:02,928 --> 00:25:05,582
you pulled me out of that car.

320
00:25:05,582 --> 00:25:08,892
You could've left me
to die but you didn't.

321
00:25:08,892 --> 00:25:09,725
So,

322
00:25:10,668 --> 00:25:14,501
this must mean more to
you than it does to me.

323
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,593
Oh yeah, here's my first bottle of piss.

324
00:25:23,582 --> 00:25:26,332
(Elijah gasping)

325
00:25:33,335 --> 00:25:36,168
(Elijah groaning)

326
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,767
(door thudding)

327
00:25:47,234 --> 00:25:49,984
(Elijah sighing)

328
00:25:53,866 --> 00:25:56,699
(Elijah groaning)

329
00:26:11,075 --> 00:26:12,742
- Giving up already?

330
00:26:17,003 --> 00:26:18,773
- Why are you doing this?

331
00:26:18,773 --> 00:26:19,793
(Robin chuckling)

332
00:26:19,793 --> 00:26:21,876
- I'm not doing anything.

333
00:26:23,504 --> 00:26:26,704
The job of a pastor's
wife is to be his rock,

334
00:26:26,704 --> 00:26:29,371
his foundation and support, yes?

335
00:26:30,876 --> 00:26:32,717
Well that was always bullshit to me.

336
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,360
(Elijah chuckling)

337
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,589
- A pastor's wife isn't
supposed to curse, you know?

338
00:26:36,589 --> 00:26:38,410
(Robin laughing)

339
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,493
- Screw that.

340
00:26:41,314 --> 00:26:43,303
When we got engaged,

341
00:26:43,303 --> 00:26:46,231
you told me this was what you
wanted to do with your life,

342
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:47,398
with our life.

343
00:26:48,366 --> 00:26:49,283
I said yes.

344
00:26:51,183 --> 00:26:54,139
But I told you then not to
expect me to sit quietly

345
00:26:54,139 --> 00:26:58,056
in the front pew to nod
and smile and say amen.

346
00:26:59,883 --> 00:27:00,871
- But you did.

347
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:02,823
(Robin and Elijah laughing)

348
00:27:02,823 --> 00:27:06,697
- A united front for
the congregation, honey.

349
00:27:06,697 --> 00:27:09,543
I knew what the old people expected.

350
00:27:09,543 --> 00:27:12,376
But I also knew what you expected.

351
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:18,479
You didn't want someone who
would walk 10 feet behind you.

352
00:27:18,643 --> 00:27:20,632
And I wouldn't have anyways, babe.

353
00:27:20,632 --> 00:27:23,873
(Elijah chuckling)

354
00:27:23,873 --> 00:27:28,722
When they offered you that
church in that neighborhood,

355
00:27:28,722 --> 00:27:31,844
I knew why you agreed to come.

356
00:27:31,844 --> 00:27:34,567
I could see it in your eyes.

357
00:27:34,567 --> 00:27:37,620
You wanted to do something.

358
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,567
And you knew that was the place to do it.

359
00:27:41,567 --> 00:27:44,484
My job was to make sure you did it.

360
00:27:46,778 --> 00:27:49,945
Even when you were your biggest enemy.

361
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:54,500
He's not your biggest enemy.

362
00:27:57,228 --> 00:27:58,061
- I...

363
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:01,045
can't.

364
00:28:02,652 --> 00:28:04,858
(Robin sighing)

365
00:28:04,858 --> 00:28:07,025
- Remember you built that?

366
00:28:08,655 --> 00:28:11,098
They dumped that huge load or rocks

367
00:28:11,098 --> 00:28:13,877
on the side over there and you,

368
00:28:13,877 --> 00:28:15,044
you got to it.

369
00:28:16,241 --> 00:28:18,241
Took you a couple weeks.

370
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:21,742
To pick the right one to lay next,

371
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:24,242
you wandered around that pile.

372
00:28:27,015 --> 00:28:29,755
You kinda looked like our
old dog, Buddy, used to look,

373
00:28:29,755 --> 00:28:32,687
wandering back and forth to
find the right place to poop.

374
00:28:32,687 --> 00:28:35,520
(Elijah laughing)

375
00:28:37,852 --> 00:28:41,352
That was my favorite sight in the morning.

376
00:28:44,871 --> 00:28:47,954
(upbeat organ music)

377
00:28:49,468 --> 00:28:51,542
(crowd cheering)

378
00:28:51,542 --> 00:28:53,655
- Hope will ruin your life!

379
00:28:53,655 --> 00:28:55,140
(crowd clapping)

380
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,691
I said,

381
00:28:56,691 --> 00:28:58,774
hope will ruin your life.

382
00:28:59,786 --> 00:29:02,149
- [Congregation] Yeah!
(people clapping)

383
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:05,827
- When you see the world as
dark and filled with dispar,

384
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,075
when you are at your lowest

385
00:29:07,075 --> 00:29:09,763
and all the walls are closing in one you,

386
00:29:09,763 --> 00:29:11,539
that's when Jesus has your back.

387
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:12,753
- [Congregation] Yes!
(people clapping)

388
00:29:12,753 --> 00:29:15,791
- Romans, Chapter Five,
Verses Three and Four.

389
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:17,755
"We glory in tribulations

390
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:20,153
"knowing that tribulation
worketh patience,

391
00:29:20,153 --> 00:29:23,315
"patience, experience
and experience, hope."

392
00:29:23,315 --> 00:29:24,403
(congregation chattering)

393
00:29:24,403 --> 00:29:27,048
We must glory in the knowledge that God,

394
00:29:27,048 --> 00:29:28,942
that Jesus will lift you up.

395
00:29:28,942 --> 00:29:29,775
(congregation chattering)

396
00:29:29,775 --> 00:29:33,057
We must rely on God's
provision, God's power.

397
00:29:33,057 --> 00:29:35,150
We must rely on hope.

398
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,390
- [Congregation] Yes!

399
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,369
- And once you rely on hope...

400
00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:39,557
- [Woman] Yeah!

401
00:29:39,557 --> 00:29:40,595
- There's no going back.

402
00:29:40,595 --> 00:29:41,451
- [Woman] That's right.
(congregation chattering)

403
00:29:41,451 --> 00:29:44,232
- There is no going back.

404
00:29:44,232 --> 00:29:48,790
So that is why I say,
hope will ruin your life.

405
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:52,157
If you've learned to live a
life comfortable with pain,

406
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,740
with dispar, with tribulations,

407
00:29:55,883 --> 00:29:58,835
then once the light of
hope as touched you.

408
00:29:58,835 --> 00:29:59,668
- [Woman] Uh-huh?

409
00:29:59,668 --> 00:30:02,459
- Oh, your old life is doomed!

410
00:30:02,459 --> 00:30:04,305
- That's right, that's right!
(congregation chattering)

411
00:30:04,305 --> 00:30:07,969
- Once the grace of God
has entered your life,

412
00:30:07,969 --> 00:30:11,282
once you have let the light walk with you,

413
00:30:11,282 --> 00:30:13,788
you can never sit comfortably again

414
00:30:13,788 --> 00:30:15,598
in the valley of the shadow of death.

415
00:30:15,598 --> 00:30:18,298
(congregation cheering and clapping)

416
00:30:18,298 --> 00:30:20,266
I'm gonna say it one last time!

417
00:30:20,266 --> 00:30:22,601
Once the Lord has given you hope...

418
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:23,434
- [Congregation] Yes!

419
00:30:23,434 --> 00:30:24,921
- It will ruin your life!

420
00:30:24,921 --> 00:30:26,905
Can I get another amen?
(congregation applauding)

421
00:30:26,905 --> 00:30:27,738
Yes!

422
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:30,855
- [Woman] Hallelujah, yeah!
(Elijah clapping)

423
00:30:30,855 --> 00:30:32,121
- Amen!

424
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:35,621
(congregation applauding)

425
00:31:05,713 --> 00:31:08,140
(Elijah clearing throat)

426
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,307
- After over a month away,

427
00:31:11,528 --> 00:31:14,104
I can't thank you all
enough for welcoming me back

428
00:31:14,104 --> 00:31:17,015
with such love and warmth.

429
00:31:17,015 --> 00:31:20,359
Eight years ago, you welcomed
me and Robin to this church

430
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:24,316
with open arms and that
love has never ceased.

431
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:28,068
With no children of our
own, you became our family.

432
00:31:28,068 --> 00:31:28,901
Now,

433
00:31:30,564 --> 00:31:32,873
now that she's gone,

434
00:31:32,873 --> 00:31:35,700
we all struggle to figure
out how to move on.

435
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,762
How do we pick up the pieces of our life?

436
00:31:38,762 --> 00:31:40,512
How do we keep faith?

437
00:31:42,939 --> 00:31:44,606
Psalms 34, verse 18.

438
00:31:46,423 --> 00:31:49,395
"The Lord is nigh unto them

439
00:31:49,395 --> 00:31:51,607
"that are of a broken heart

440
00:31:51,607 --> 00:31:55,357
"and saveth such as be
of a contrite spirit."

441
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,938
And Lamentations Three.

442
00:31:58,938 --> 00:32:01,798
"For the Lord will not cast off forever

443
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:04,397
"but though He cause grief
yet will He have compassion

444
00:32:04,397 --> 00:32:07,048
"according to the
multitude of His mercies.

445
00:32:07,048 --> 00:32:08,997
"For He doth not afflict willingly

446
00:32:08,997 --> 00:32:12,422
"nor grieve the children of men.

447
00:32:12,422 --> 00:32:15,296
(dramatic piano music)

448
00:32:15,296 --> 00:32:16,445
"Does not

449
00:32:16,445 --> 00:32:17,278
"afflict

450
00:32:18,347 --> 00:32:19,347
"willingly."

451
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,089
Does He not though?

452
00:32:26,197 --> 00:32:30,197
My strength and hope has
perished from the Lord.

453
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:35,021
I was going to get up here
and say a bunch of empty,

454
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:36,688
comforting nonsense,

455
00:32:38,476 --> 00:32:42,246
but instead, I'm going
to be honest and plain.

456
00:32:42,246 --> 00:32:45,446
I don't know how to move
forward with my life.

457
00:32:45,446 --> 00:32:49,363
I've lied to everyone
about how well I'm doing.

458
00:32:50,414 --> 00:32:55,414
I can't take care of myself and
all of you at the same time.

459
00:32:56,102 --> 00:32:56,935
I...

460
00:32:59,041 --> 00:32:59,874
can't.

461
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,637
(door clanking)

462
00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:10,470
(bandage tearing)

463
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,303
(Chill yelping)

464
00:33:11,303 --> 00:33:12,768
- He that covereth his sins...
- What the fuck, dude?

465
00:33:12,768 --> 00:33:13,771
Jesus Christ!
- Shall not prosper!

466
00:33:13,771 --> 00:33:14,646
- What the fuck?

467
00:33:14,646 --> 00:33:15,594
- But whoso confesseth

468
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:16,696
and forsaketh them...
- Fuck you, man!

469
00:33:16,696 --> 00:33:17,775
- Shall have mercy!
- Seriously!

470
00:33:17,775 --> 00:33:18,608
Hey!

471
00:33:18,608 --> 00:33:19,566
- Thus, it is written...

472
00:33:19,566 --> 00:33:20,399
- Hey!

473
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:21,232
(Chill groaning)

474
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:22,229
- Saith the Lord.

475
00:33:22,229 --> 00:33:23,571
- It's not gonna happen, man!

476
00:33:23,571 --> 00:33:24,654
- Saith the...

477
00:33:24,654 --> 00:33:27,219
- Hey, stop it, nigger, listen to me!

478
00:33:27,219 --> 00:33:29,380
I don't know what the fuck your deal is

479
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,171
and I don't fucking care,

480
00:33:31,171 --> 00:33:32,923
but you should've just
let me to fucking die

481
00:33:32,923 --> 00:33:34,947
because I'm not gonna lay
here and listen to you

482
00:33:34,947 --> 00:33:37,070
to preach some fucking sermon!

483
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:41,146
So save it for the niggers
in your church back home!

484
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:43,371
- Saith the nigger Lord for
I know the nigger thoughts

485
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:44,560
I think towards You.

486
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,526
Nigger thoughts of peace and not of evil...

487
00:33:46,526 --> 00:33:47,705
- Oh my...
- To give you an expected

488
00:33:47,705 --> 00:33:49,177
nigger end.
- Fucking God!

489
00:33:49,177 --> 00:33:51,152
- A nigger plans for a nigger hope

490
00:33:51,152 --> 00:33:52,949
and a nigger future.

(Elijah sighing)

511
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:53,567
- You're on Hawks Ridge in
the Blue Ridge Mountains.

512
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:56,548
This is the cabin Robin's
parents built 25 years ago

513
00:34:56,548 --> 00:34:59,014
and left us when they passed.

514
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:01,397
I've been here alone
for the past 18 months.

515
00:35:01,397 --> 00:35:03,444
This was our retreat.

516
00:35:03,444 --> 00:35:05,580
There's no phone here, no internet,

517
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,747
just books and boardgames.

518
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,142
With all the rain and flooding,
the road is washed out,

519
00:35:12,142 --> 00:35:15,110
which doesn't matter anyway
because I have no car.

520
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:18,473
It's 10 miles down the
ridge to the nearest town,

521
00:35:18,473 --> 00:35:19,917
so with all the mud,

522
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:24,667
you wouldn't make it down
there anyway on your leg, so...

523
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,707
You're stuck here with me.

524
00:35:31,192 --> 00:35:33,359
We have to make this work.

525
00:35:36,353 --> 00:35:37,186
- Fuck.

526
00:35:38,588 --> 00:35:40,988
Yo, where are my cigarettes?

527
00:35:40,988 --> 00:35:41,821
- What?

528
00:35:42,743 --> 00:35:46,257
- I had cigarettes on me, where are they?

529
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:47,608
- I threw them out.

530
00:35:47,608 --> 00:35:49,049
Do you understand what I just told you?

531
00:35:49,049 --> 00:35:50,505
I know why you're here.

532
00:35:50,505 --> 00:35:52,334
I know what I have to do.

533
00:35:52,334 --> 00:35:53,417
- Damn, dude.

534
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:58,472
Yo, you should've just
left me to fucking die.

535
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:01,692
You think I'm an asshole now,

536
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:04,977
just wait till I haven't
had a cigarette in a day.

537
00:36:04,977 --> 00:36:06,595
For real.

538
00:36:06,595 --> 00:36:08,687
- I have a routine.

539
00:36:08,687 --> 00:36:09,633
To get me through the day,

540
00:36:09,633 --> 00:36:13,305
to make sure that everything
works around here.

541
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:15,055
Especially in winter.

542
00:36:19,142 --> 00:36:20,725
I need you to shit.

543
00:36:23,674 --> 00:36:25,300
- What?

544
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,133
- To shit.

545
00:36:27,924 --> 00:36:29,925
I need to get you to that bathroom there

546
00:36:29,925 --> 00:36:34,193
to make sure that
everything's okay inside.

547
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:36,627
- Dude, you are not watching me shit.

548
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:38,627
- I have no desire to...

549
00:36:41,196 --> 00:36:43,394
I just need to get you there.

550
00:36:43,394 --> 00:36:44,227
Come on.

551
00:36:44,227 --> 00:36:47,532
- Get them nigger hands of me!

552
00:36:47,532 --> 00:36:50,115
I don't need your goddamn help.

553
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,443
I know where it is.

554
00:36:59,794 --> 00:37:01,985
(Chill groaning)

555
00:37:01,985 --> 00:37:03,522
(Chill yelping)

556
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:04,355
Fuck.

557
00:37:05,351 --> 00:37:06,184
Fuck.

558
00:37:09,696 --> 00:37:12,363
(Chill huffing)

559
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:16,706
That ain't nothing.

560
00:37:16,706 --> 00:37:18,829
That ain't shit.

561
00:37:18,829 --> 00:37:19,662
Oh fuck!

562
00:37:20,952 --> 00:37:23,781
(Chill groaning)

563
00:37:23,781 --> 00:37:26,531
(Chill wheezing)

564
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,553
Oh.

565
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,080
Oh shit.

566
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,423
(Chill huffing)

567
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:37,978
I'm okay.

568
00:37:37,978 --> 00:37:39,413
Motherfuck.

569
00:37:39,413 --> 00:37:40,893
Yeah, bitch.

570
00:37:40,893 --> 00:37:42,820
I'm too strong.

571
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,867
Too strong, motherfucker, oh God.

572
00:37:45,867 --> 00:37:46,700
Gah!

573
00:37:48,858 --> 00:37:50,501
(Chill groaning)

574
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:52,400
You motherfucker.

575
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,067
(Chill moaning)

576
00:37:55,922 --> 00:37:58,401
Yeah, I'm too strong, dude.

577
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,234
Oh yeah.

578
00:38:00,682 --> 00:38:02,071
Watch me!

579
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,404
Watch me, bitch.

580
00:38:04,341 --> 00:38:07,091
(Chill groaning)

581
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:11,438
Yeah, fuck you, nigger!

582
00:38:11,438 --> 00:38:13,191
(Chill moaning)

583
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:14,524
Oh shit, nigger!

584
00:38:15,688 --> 00:38:18,141
There ain't no lights in here.

585
00:38:18,141 --> 00:38:19,688
(Chill moaning)

586
00:38:19,688 --> 00:38:22,688
I'll shit in the dark, nigger, fuck!

587
00:38:25,714 --> 00:38:30,714
(wind howling)
(metal clanking)

588
00:38:30,864 --> 00:38:34,357
(birds chirping)

589
00:38:34,357 --> 00:38:37,107
(Chill coughing)

590
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:11,111
(dishwasher clanking)

591
00:39:11,111 --> 00:39:13,944
(dishes clacking)

592
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:19,800
(Chill coughing)

593
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,593
(Chill coughing)

594
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:04,671
(Elijah groaning)

595
00:40:06,687 --> 00:40:09,937
(dramatic piano music)

596
00:40:13,717 --> 00:40:16,467
(Chill coughing)

597
00:40:31,636 --> 00:40:34,386
(Chill coughing)

598
00:40:36,312 --> 00:40:40,145
(dramatic instrumental music)

599
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:03,783
(Elijah chuckling)

600
00:41:03,783 --> 00:41:04,700
- Menthols.

601
00:41:05,762 --> 00:41:06,595
Of course.

602
00:41:18,855 --> 00:41:20,522
Don't start with me.

603
00:41:23,342 --> 00:41:26,092
(match sizzling)

604
00:41:37,023 --> 00:41:40,856
(dramatic instrumental music)

605
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:01,463
(toilet flushing)

606
00:42:16,052 --> 00:42:18,607
I'll make a deal with you.

607
00:42:18,607 --> 00:42:23,140
You can have one of these
out on that porch here

608
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,348
but,

609
00:42:24,348 --> 00:42:25,763
but...

610
00:42:25,763 --> 00:42:28,282
as long as it takes you to smoke it,

611
00:42:28,282 --> 00:42:29,852
you gotta talk to me.

612
00:42:29,852 --> 00:42:31,852
You gotta talk honestly.

613
00:42:34,733 --> 00:42:35,566
- Nope.

614
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:39,367
(Elijah chuckling)

615
00:42:39,367 --> 00:42:41,989
- You've got nicotine withdraw.

616
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:44,823
The headache, the aches and pains.

617
00:42:44,823 --> 00:42:46,145
(Chill coughing)

618
00:42:46,145 --> 00:42:46,978
The cough.

619
00:42:47,996 --> 00:42:48,996
- I said no.

620
00:42:50,731 --> 00:42:52,110
(Chill coughing)

621
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,360
- Constipation?

622
00:42:54,472 --> 00:42:56,118
- Yo, is it possible to play some music

623
00:42:56,118 --> 00:42:58,256
up in here or something?

624
00:42:58,256 --> 00:43:00,923
You got a Nintendo or some shit?

625
00:43:02,507 --> 00:43:03,784
Damn.

626
00:43:03,784 --> 00:43:05,264
- It was a good plan, you know.

627
00:43:05,264 --> 00:43:08,550
(gentle piano music)
So,

628
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:09,383
now what?

629
00:43:10,675 --> 00:43:13,262
- There is no "now what."

630
00:43:13,262 --> 00:43:15,544
I don't know what else to do.

631
00:43:15,544 --> 00:43:17,286
What, are we both stuck
here until his leg heals

632
00:43:17,286 --> 00:43:18,967
and he hobbles away?

633
00:43:18,967 --> 00:43:20,794
- That is an option.

634
00:43:20,794 --> 00:43:22,717
- Tell me what to do.

635
00:43:22,717 --> 00:43:24,368
- What?

636
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:26,762
Big old preacher man can't
get the big bad drug dealer

637
00:43:26,762 --> 00:43:29,149
to come out and play with him?

638
00:43:29,149 --> 00:43:33,077
Get your head out your ass and
try something else, Elijah!

639
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:36,223
- Don't do that, this
was your fucking idea!

640
00:43:36,223 --> 00:43:37,657
Tell me what to do.

641
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:40,407
(dramatic music)

642
00:43:45,554 --> 00:43:48,221
(door thudding)

643
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:52,683
What?

644
00:43:56,869 --> 00:43:58,619
- Yo, where's my gun?

645
00:44:01,986 --> 00:44:04,349
You lied to me about the cigarettes.

646
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:09,182
You took them from me, I had
a gun on me too, where is it?

647
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:11,370
- It's gone.

648
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:15,082
I disassembled it

649
00:44:15,082 --> 00:44:17,695
and threw the pieces off into the ridge.

650
00:44:17,695 --> 00:44:20,528
They're rusting in the mud by now.

651
00:44:26,668 --> 00:44:27,941
- All right.

652
00:44:27,941 --> 00:44:29,311
Fine, deal.

653
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:31,427
But on one condition.

654
00:44:31,427 --> 00:44:33,913
One cigarette a day.

655
00:44:33,913 --> 00:44:36,735
That pack's gotta last me this winter.

656
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,568
All right?

657
00:44:39,223 --> 00:44:40,056
- Yeah.

658
00:44:40,056 --> 00:44:41,263
Also means I don't have
to talk to your ass

659
00:44:41,263 --> 00:44:43,930
for more than six minutes a day.

660
00:44:47,133 --> 00:44:49,716
(wind howling)

661
00:44:54,624 --> 00:44:58,037
(Elijah sighing)

662
00:44:58,037 --> 00:45:00,037
- I'm sorry for earlier.

663
00:45:03,232 --> 00:45:05,815
You are the stubbornest person.

664
00:45:06,671 --> 00:45:09,586
- This is important to me, Eli.

665
00:45:09,586 --> 00:45:11,007
- I know.

666
00:45:11,007 --> 00:45:13,235
- The kids in that neighborhood,

667
00:45:13,235 --> 00:45:14,318
they need us.

668
00:45:15,269 --> 00:45:16,102
- I know.

669
00:45:17,957 --> 00:45:21,858
- I was upfront about this
from the start, wasn't I?

670
00:45:21,858 --> 00:45:24,058
What's the point in doing missionary work

671
00:45:24,058 --> 00:45:27,042
in some other country when the third world

672
00:45:27,042 --> 00:45:29,519
is right outside of our door?

673
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:32,389
- Where do we even start?

674
00:45:32,389 --> 00:45:34,999
- I'm sorry we're not in
some cushy megachurch.

675
00:45:34,999 --> 00:45:36,415
I know part of you wanted that.

676
00:45:36,415 --> 00:45:37,915
- That's not true.

677
00:45:43,428 --> 00:45:45,845
- You were called there, Eli.

678
00:45:48,118 --> 00:45:48,951
Called.

679
00:45:49,883 --> 00:45:50,716
Sorry.

680
00:45:52,775 --> 00:45:57,066
There are black kids
selling drugs and worse.

681
00:45:57,066 --> 00:46:00,122
Right across the street from us.

682
00:46:00,122 --> 00:46:02,426
Their mothers come in every week

683
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,259
praying for help, for deliverance.

684
00:46:07,045 --> 00:46:08,706
We are that deliverance.

685
00:46:08,706 --> 00:46:09,873
We have to be.

686
00:46:17,557 --> 00:46:21,307
- So it really came down
to a coin toss, huh?

687
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:24,221
To determine whether your parents

688
00:46:24,221 --> 00:46:26,799
were going to build a house on the beach

689
00:46:26,799 --> 00:46:29,039
or up here in the mountains?

690
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:30,666
- Mmm.

691
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:31,499
Yes.

692
00:46:32,711 --> 00:46:36,034
But I think Mom may have
made it clear to Dad

693
00:46:36,034 --> 00:46:39,263
that no matter what
side the coin landed on,

694
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:41,039
it was gonna be heads.

695
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:43,186
(Elijah chuckling)

696
00:46:43,186 --> 00:46:44,967
- Yeah, of course.

697
00:46:44,967 --> 00:46:46,300
And here we are.

698
00:46:48,362 --> 00:46:51,871
- You won't be alone, sweetheart.

699
00:46:51,871 --> 00:46:52,704
- Hey.

700
00:46:55,661 --> 00:46:56,494
Hey.

701
00:46:57,746 --> 00:46:58,579
Hey!

702
00:47:01,477 --> 00:47:02,310
Well?

703
00:47:03,527 --> 00:47:06,110
(wind howling)

704
00:47:07,252 --> 00:47:08,903
Yeah.

705
00:47:08,903 --> 00:47:09,736
Yeah.

706
00:47:15,456 --> 00:47:17,956
Helped yourself to one, I see.

707
00:47:19,759 --> 00:47:22,509
(match sizzling)

708
00:47:31,681 --> 00:47:32,514
Yeah.

709
00:47:33,967 --> 00:47:37,051
- [Elijah] You addicted to anything else?

710
00:47:37,051 --> 00:47:37,884
- No.

711
00:47:40,033 --> 00:47:41,607
- I gotta know.

712
00:47:41,607 --> 00:47:44,676
I didn't see anything on
your arms when you were out.

713
00:47:44,676 --> 00:47:46,996
But I don't really know
what I'm looking for.

714
00:47:46,996 --> 00:47:48,330
I gotta know if I should expect

715
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:50,095
worse withdrawal than nicotine.

716
00:47:50,095 --> 00:47:51,916
- I said no.

717
00:47:51,916 --> 00:47:52,916
- All right.

718
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:58,199
I helped a few of your
customers get clean,

719
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:02,032
so I know you sold mostly
coke, scag and Tina.

720
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:04,020
Was there anything else?

721
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,898
(Chill laughing)

722
00:48:05,898 --> 00:48:06,731
- Dude.

723
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,410
Scag?

724
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:10,243
Tina?

725
00:48:10,243 --> 00:48:11,817
For real?

726
00:48:11,817 --> 00:48:13,716
This how you wanna get into this?

727
00:48:13,716 --> 00:48:16,270
By trying to impress me
with your street talk?

728
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:18,215
- [Elijah] Was there?

729
00:48:18,215 --> 00:48:19,452
- Yeah.

730
00:48:19,452 --> 00:48:21,634
Yeah, I also sold

731
00:48:21,634 --> 00:48:23,967
flimflam, boop and staplers.

732
00:48:25,854 --> 00:48:26,938
Hey man, there's a heavy demand

733
00:48:26,938 --> 00:48:29,204
for office supplies in the ghetto.

734
00:48:29,204 --> 00:48:30,960
(Chill laughing)

735
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,346
(Chill coughing)

736
00:48:34,346 --> 00:48:37,263
- You enjoying that Menthol, there?

737
00:48:39,106 --> 00:48:40,689
- No, nothing else.

738
00:48:41,951 --> 00:48:45,368
Just cocaine, heroin and meth, that's it.

739
00:48:46,206 --> 00:48:51,144
Your slang is about 800 years
out of date, by the way.

740
00:48:51,144 --> 00:48:51,977
- Why?

741
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:56,195
- Why what?

742
00:48:56,195 --> 00:48:58,424
- Why did you do it?

743
00:48:58,424 --> 00:49:00,289
Why destroy people's lives like that?

744
00:49:00,289 --> 00:49:02,356
Kids, families, why?

745
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:05,587
- Jesus, man, you gotta be kidding me.

746
00:49:05,587 --> 00:49:07,956
Their lives are already fucked, dude.

747
00:49:07,956 --> 00:49:09,420
I offered them escape.

748
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:10,648
- Escape?

749
00:49:10,648 --> 00:49:11,986
- Yeah.

750
00:49:11,986 --> 00:49:13,814
The ghetto sucks.

751
00:49:13,814 --> 00:49:15,339
- What the hell do you
know about the ghetto?

752
00:49:15,339 --> 00:49:16,172
- What the hell do I...

753
00:49:16,172 --> 00:49:18,330
What the hell do you
know about the ghetto?

754
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,826
You live in a literal
fucking castle on a mountain,

755
00:49:20,826 --> 00:49:22,231
you rich-ass motherfucker!

756
00:49:22,231 --> 00:49:24,988
- I grew up in a
neighborhood just like that.

757
00:49:24,988 --> 00:49:25,821
- So what.

758
00:49:27,193 --> 00:49:29,312
You got out, right?

759
00:49:29,312 --> 00:49:30,466
You didn't get to where you are now

760
00:49:30,466 --> 00:49:32,633
by staying there, did you?

761
00:49:33,492 --> 00:49:35,394
Someone got you out.

762
00:49:35,394 --> 00:49:36,227
No, wait,

763
00:49:37,486 --> 00:49:39,914
something got you out

764
00:49:39,914 --> 00:49:41,831
and I know what it was.

765
00:49:43,303 --> 00:49:44,136
Money.

766
00:49:45,579 --> 00:49:47,500
Who died, your grand mama?

767
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,917
Your grand daddy?

768
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:52,767
Yeah, someone died and you got the cash,

769
00:49:52,767 --> 00:49:54,716
so you got to leave and go to college

770
00:49:54,716 --> 00:49:58,528
and become a smarty art nigger,
preaching at me right now.

771
00:49:58,528 --> 00:49:59,445
Am I right?

772
00:50:03,187 --> 00:50:05,640
- It was a scholarship.

773
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,564
- Whatever, man, it's
the same fucking thing.

774
00:50:07,564 --> 00:50:08,981
It's still money.

775
00:50:11,052 --> 00:50:13,484
Hey, yo, that's why I did it.

776
00:50:13,484 --> 00:50:14,987
That's why I did it.

777
00:50:14,987 --> 00:50:16,596
Money.

778
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:18,713
That's why those boys work for me.

779
00:50:18,713 --> 00:50:20,241
Money.

780
00:50:20,241 --> 00:50:21,158
It ain't...

781
00:50:22,175 --> 00:50:24,051
Like I said, the ghetto fucking sucks

782
00:50:24,051 --> 00:50:27,552
and you either give up
or you get the fuck out.

783
00:50:27,552 --> 00:50:29,101
And, listen, I don't know
where the fuck you're from

784
00:50:29,101 --> 00:50:32,624
but I grew up three
blocks from that church.

785
00:50:32,624 --> 00:50:34,152
I saw a dude get stabbed
in front of my eyes

786
00:50:34,152 --> 00:50:36,152
when I was 11 years old.

787
00:50:38,152 --> 00:50:39,235
11 years old.

788
00:50:41,029 --> 00:50:43,878
Saw my first drive-by when I was 12,

789
00:50:43,878 --> 00:50:46,307
started dealing when I was 15.

790
00:50:46,307 --> 00:50:47,140
Money.

791
00:50:49,811 --> 00:50:51,343
Shit, nigger, ain't nobody getting

792
00:50:51,343 --> 00:50:53,396
a scholarship where we live.

793
00:50:53,396 --> 00:50:55,229
So this is what we do.

794
00:51:02,234 --> 00:51:03,671
- 15, huh?

795
00:51:03,671 --> 00:51:04,663
- Mm-hmm.

796
00:51:04,663 --> 00:51:08,553
- Well you're a really shitty
drug dealer then, aren't you?

797
00:51:08,553 --> 00:51:09,445
- [Chill] What?

798
00:51:09,445 --> 00:51:13,136
- Give up or get the fuck out, right?

799
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:14,803
What're you, 34, 35?

800
00:51:16,382 --> 00:51:18,899
So you've been at this almost 20 years

801
00:51:18,899 --> 00:51:20,949
and you're still in that neighborhood.

802
00:51:20,949 --> 00:51:22,532
Mmm, shitty dealer.

803
00:51:24,701 --> 00:51:26,383
- Smarty art nigger.

804
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:27,858
- So when did you give up?

805
00:51:27,858 --> 00:51:29,085
- Man, fuck you, nigger?

806
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:30,267
(Elijah chuckling)

807
00:51:30,267 --> 00:51:31,167
- Hey, you oughta know by now

808
00:51:31,167 --> 00:51:33,831
that that's not gonna get
a rise out of me, right?

809
00:51:33,831 --> 00:51:36,469
I've had better men than you call me that.

810
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:39,562
- All right then, suck my dick.

811
00:51:39,562 --> 00:51:41,597
- That sob story you just told,

812
00:51:41,597 --> 00:51:44,682
it's bullshit and we both know it.

813
00:51:44,682 --> 00:51:47,914
Robin and I got several
kids off the streets

814
00:51:47,914 --> 00:51:49,261
and into good schools.

815
00:51:49,261 --> 00:51:51,415
They got out without you.

816
00:51:51,415 --> 00:51:52,248
- Several?

817
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:55,855
You're talking about La
Von and Siquis, right?

818
00:51:55,855 --> 00:51:58,022
At the prep school uptown?

819
00:51:59,351 --> 00:52:03,302
Nigger, they're dealing
for me up there now.

820
00:52:03,302 --> 00:52:06,275
Oh damn, you didn't know that, did you?

821
00:52:06,275 --> 00:52:09,782
Yeah, takes money to hang
out with rich kids, bro.

822
00:52:09,782 --> 00:52:11,134
Let me guess, you and that wife of yours,

823
00:52:11,134 --> 00:52:15,467
you just send them off and
hope for the best, right?

824
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:19,823
Oh shit.

825
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:23,410
Oh shit, no.

826
00:52:25,082 --> 00:52:27,374
You did keep in touch with them

827
00:52:27,374 --> 00:52:29,679
and they lied right to
your face, didn't they?

828
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:32,267
Those bad little nigger boys.

829
00:52:32,267 --> 00:52:33,906
Mmm.

830
00:52:33,906 --> 00:52:37,156
So much for "Operation: Ghetto Rescue."

831
00:52:38,339 --> 00:52:41,487
(wind howling)

832
00:52:41,487 --> 00:52:43,890
We're done, by the way.

833
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:45,173
- No.

834
00:52:45,173 --> 00:52:46,450
- Yeah.

835
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:47,283
- No!

836
00:52:49,055 --> 00:52:49,888
- Do it.

837
00:52:49,888 --> 00:52:51,101
- I will.

838
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:52,836
- It ain't worth listening
to your bullshit.

839
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,726
- There's gotta be more to it than that.

840
00:52:54,726 --> 00:52:56,231
More than just money.

841
00:52:56,231 --> 00:52:58,682
There are other ways,
there's always another way.

842
00:52:58,682 --> 00:53:00,749
You think you're the only
one with a hard life?

843
00:53:00,749 --> 00:53:01,582
So what is it?

844
00:53:01,582 --> 00:53:02,459
Power?

845
00:53:02,459 --> 00:53:05,093
You a big man bossing kids around?

846
00:53:05,093 --> 00:53:07,149
- Yo man, why do you care?

847
00:53:07,149 --> 00:53:08,946
Seriously, dude, what the fuck is this?

848
00:53:08,946 --> 00:53:10,652
Why are we doing this?

849
00:53:10,652 --> 00:53:12,485
We fucking hate each other, right?

850
00:53:12,485 --> 00:53:14,506
I killed your wife, remember?

851
00:53:14,506 --> 00:53:15,339
So why the fuck do you,

852
00:53:15,339 --> 00:53:18,570
why do you give a shit
what I do or why I did it?

853
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,737
Seriously, man, fuck this!

854
00:53:23,102 --> 00:53:25,019
- Yes, I need it, okay?

855
00:53:26,331 --> 00:53:27,164
God.

856
00:53:30,122 --> 00:53:31,247
Yes.

857
00:53:31,247 --> 00:53:32,580
I need it, okay?

858
00:53:33,472 --> 00:53:35,496
After Robin, it was gone.

859
00:53:35,496 --> 00:53:39,113
All of it, faith, God, everything.

860
00:53:39,113 --> 00:53:42,030
If I'm honest, it left me long ago.

861
00:53:43,035 --> 00:53:44,275
You're right.

862
00:53:44,275 --> 00:53:46,840
For every kid we got off the
street, you found two more.

863
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,590
For every addict we cleaned up...

864
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:55,395
Counting the offering money
in my underwear at night.

865
00:53:57,301 --> 00:53:59,891
The church, it was just a business.

866
00:53:59,891 --> 00:54:01,058
After Robin...

867
00:54:03,936 --> 00:54:08,269
There's got to be a reason
you were sent here to me.

868
00:54:10,304 --> 00:54:11,637
This is my test.

869
00:54:16,368 --> 00:54:17,201
Here.

870
00:54:21,688 --> 00:54:22,521
Hate.

871
00:54:23,981 --> 00:54:25,148
You said hate.

872
00:54:26,749 --> 00:54:28,820
If I had no real effect
on you, on your business,

873
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:30,653
why would you hate me?

874
00:54:31,784 --> 00:54:33,951
What did I ever do to you?

875
00:54:41,699 --> 00:54:43,366
- Smarty art nigger.

876
00:54:47,773 --> 00:54:50,440
(door thudding)

877
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,287
- Welcome, everyone.

878
00:54:56,287 --> 00:54:58,987
So happy to see so many of
you here this afternoon.

879
00:54:58,987 --> 00:55:01,183
When Mrs. Frank and I
came up with the idea

880
00:55:01,183 --> 00:55:02,708
for this youth group here in the church,

881
00:55:02,708 --> 00:55:06,738
we struggled to come up with
a clever and cool name for it

882
00:55:06,738 --> 00:55:10,234
and then we realized the
very definition of uncool

883
00:55:10,234 --> 00:55:13,186
is anything thought of
by a pastor and his wife.

884
00:55:13,186 --> 00:55:14,154
(Robin chuckling)

885
00:55:14,154 --> 00:55:16,447
So here we are at the first meeting

886
00:55:16,447 --> 00:55:18,335
with no name for ourselves.

887
00:55:18,335 --> 00:55:19,868
And you know what, who cares?

888
00:55:19,868 --> 00:55:21,191
The name doesn't matter.

889
00:55:21,191 --> 00:55:23,898
What matters is what we
do with out time together.

890
00:55:23,898 --> 00:55:25,359
We know what's going on out there,

891
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:28,047
we know what you're going
through and the main thing

892
00:55:28,047 --> 00:55:31,396
that we want you to
feel in here is safety.

893
00:55:31,396 --> 00:55:34,094
During our time together,
you can say anything

894
00:55:34,094 --> 00:55:36,299
and talk about anything
as long as it is done

895
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:38,382
with respect and honesty.

896
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:44,364
Okay, I had some ideas for
some activities and games

897
00:55:44,364 --> 00:55:46,638
to start us off but that felt wrong to me.

898
00:55:46,638 --> 00:55:48,898
Instead, what I'd rather
do is go around the room

899
00:55:48,898 --> 00:55:50,386
and have each of you tell us your name

900
00:55:50,386 --> 00:55:52,228
and a little something about yourself.

901
00:55:52,228 --> 00:55:53,228
Who's first?

902
00:56:02,018 --> 00:56:03,685
Okay, I'll go first.

903
00:56:04,818 --> 00:56:07,066
My name is Pastor Elijah Frank

904
00:56:07,066 --> 00:56:08,647
and I grew up in a small town

905
00:56:08,647 --> 00:56:10,962
in the western part of this state.

906
00:56:10,962 --> 00:56:13,156
And when I was eight years old,

907
00:56:13,156 --> 00:56:16,978
my daddy got drunk and shot my mother.

908
00:56:16,978 --> 00:56:20,751
She died and my dad went
to jail where he also died.

909
00:56:20,751 --> 00:56:22,001
And after that,

910
00:56:22,908 --> 00:56:26,887
nothing in life ever
really felt right again.

911
00:56:26,887 --> 00:56:27,895
Yeah.

912
00:56:27,895 --> 00:56:31,554
They told me his name was
Chill, if you can believe that.

913
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:34,053
- [Man] Yeah, we know the name, white guy?

914
00:56:34,053 --> 00:56:35,522
- Well, if you know who it is,

915
00:56:35,522 --> 00:56:37,170
is there anything that can be done?

916
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:40,060
- [Man] Reverend, believe
me, if there was, we would.

917
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:41,866
But he keeps himself above it all.

918
00:56:41,866 --> 00:56:43,992
If you could get any
of those kids of yours

919
00:56:43,992 --> 00:56:44,870
to make a statement...

920
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:46,927
- I'm sorry, sergeant, I can't.

921
00:56:46,927 --> 00:56:49,290
I promised to keep them all safe, sorry.

922
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:51,578
- [Sergeant] Then I'm sorry too.

923
00:56:51,578 --> 00:56:53,457
All right, well thank you.

924
00:56:53,457 --> 00:56:54,557

925
00:56:54,557 --> 00:56:55,977
Hey, and reverend?

926
00:56:55,977 --> 00:56:56,810
- Yeah.

927
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:59,403
- [Sergeant] Keep doing what you're doing.

928
00:56:59,403 --> 00:57:00,236
- Thanks.

- If you weren't so deep
into church finances,

935
00:57:58,087 --> 00:58:00,630
you'd have heard me come
home 20 minutes ago.

936
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:03,248

heat that place, you know.

937
00:58:03,248 --> 00:58:04,665
- Well, lucky me.

938

00:59:10,061 --> 00:59:10,894

959
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:15,751
- What are you doing?

960
00:59:15,751 --> 00:59:19,317
- Goddamn, Jesus, don't do that, man!

961
00:59:19,317 --> 00:59:21,636
I'm fucking starving, dude.

962

I can't take this crap
you've been giving me, man.

Don't you got anything good in here?

(Chill gasping)

966
00:59:34,878 --> 00:59:36,128
- Nothing, man.

967
00:59:37,049 --> 00:59:39,017
(Chill groaning)

968
00:59:39,017 --> 00:59:41,966
(Chill vomiting)

969
00:59:41,966 --> 00:59:43,299
- What the fuck?

970
00:59:50,692 --> 00:59:52,310
Here.

971
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:53,393
Just in case.

972
00:59:56,193 --> 00:59:58,737
This is more than just nicotine.

973
00:59:58,737 --> 00:59:59,654
What is it?

974
01:00:01,446 --> 01:00:02,875
- Heroine

975
01:00:02,875 --> 01:00:04,125
- Jesus Christ.

976
01:00:05,324 --> 01:00:06,157
How long?

977
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:08,816
How long since you last used?

978
01:00:08,816 --> 01:00:10,660
- I don't know.

979
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:12,297
Six days, I think.

980
01:00:12,297 --> 01:00:14,793
- Okay, Jesus, okay.

981
01:00:14,793 --> 01:00:15,982
All right, you were unconscious

982
01:00:15,982 --> 01:00:18,323
for probably the worst of it.

983
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:21,656
Okay, so we just gotta ride out tonight.

984
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:28,107
You threw the cigarettes
off the back porch, so...

985
01:00:29,148 --> 01:00:29,981
Ugh.

986
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:35,817
This is probably the
stupidest decision ever

987
01:00:35,817 --> 01:00:37,900
but I don't care anymore.

988
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,636
I can get you drunk.

989
01:00:42,342 --> 01:00:43,693
You wanna get drunk?

990
01:00:43,693 --> 01:00:48,693
Because I could sure use a
drink myself, for damn sure.

991
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:51,049
- Are you fucking kidding me?

992
01:00:51,049 --> 01:00:53,998
Where the hell was this two days ago?

993
01:00:53,998 --> 01:00:54,831
- Yeah.

994
01:00:56,518 --> 01:00:59,851
(pleasant guitar music)

995
01:01:01,265 --> 01:01:03,193
- Yo wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

996
01:01:03,193 --> 01:01:04,499
Who the better man?

997
01:01:04,499 --> 01:01:05,974
- What?

998
01:01:05,974 --> 01:01:09,369
- The better man that called you nigger.

999
01:01:09,369 --> 01:01:10,383
- What?

1000
01:01:10,383 --> 01:01:12,633
- You said, earlier, you said

1001
01:01:12,633 --> 01:01:13,580
there was other better men...

1002
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:16,067
- Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1003
01:01:16,067 --> 01:01:17,547
Yeah, that.

1004
01:01:17,547 --> 01:01:18,380
Yeah,

1005
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:19,880
his royal highness

1006
01:01:22,316 --> 01:01:25,816
Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salim Al-Sabah.

1007
01:01:29,382 --> 01:01:30,715
- What the fuck?

1008
01:01:31,823 --> 01:01:34,849
Dude, that ain't no real name.

1009
01:01:34,849 --> 01:01:36,469
- The nine days ruler

1010
01:01:36,469 --> 01:01:40,626
of the sovereign country
of Kuwait in 2006.

1011
01:01:40,626 --> 01:01:42,889
Of course, when I met him he was in charge

1012
01:01:42,889 --> 01:01:46,040
of Kuwait's shitty excuse for a military.

1013
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:49,223
- Dude, what the fuck
are you talking about?

1014
01:01:49,223 --> 01:01:51,250
- The Gulf War.

1015
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,410
- In Afghanistan?

1016
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:54,243
- In Iraq.

1017
01:01:55,591 --> 01:01:56,674
Desert Storm?

1018
01:01:57,558 --> 01:01:58,391
1991.

1019
01:01:59,842 --> 01:02:02,116
- Nigger, I was like eight years old.

1020
01:02:02,116 --> 01:02:02,949
- Jesus.

1021
01:02:03,916 --> 01:02:05,534
- [Chill] So you was in the army?

1022
01:02:05,534 --> 01:02:07,035
- Yeah.

1023
01:02:07,035 --> 01:02:10,118
Combat Medic Specialist, third class.

1024
01:02:10,966 --> 01:02:11,883
- For real?

1025
01:02:15,026 --> 01:02:15,859
Oh damn.

1026
01:02:16,814 --> 01:02:18,370
Oh damn.

1027
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:19,818
This you right here?

1028
01:02:19,818 --> 01:02:21,674
Nigger Bob Ross?

1029
01:02:21,674 --> 01:02:22,788
(Chill laughing)

1030
01:02:22,788 --> 01:02:24,100
- Yeah, yeah.

1031
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:26,758
We were on the Kuwait, Iraq boarder

1032
01:02:26,758 --> 01:02:29,897
when a shell went off near us.

1033
01:02:29,897 --> 01:02:32,259
The sheikh was with us and he got wounded.

1034
01:02:32,259 --> 01:02:34,972
I went to help him and when I got to him,

1035
01:02:34,972 --> 01:02:36,596
his royal highness,

1036
01:02:36,596 --> 01:02:39,301
darker than my own brown ass, by the way.

1037
01:02:39,301 --> 01:02:40,551
- Ah.
- He says,

1038
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:46,018
he doesn't want some
nigger working on him.

1039
01:02:46,018 --> 01:02:47,518
- [Chill] Oh shit.

1040
01:02:48,892 --> 01:02:52,566
- Yeah, so you can understand
if I don't get upset

1041
01:02:52,566 --> 01:02:55,962
when some two-bit drug
dealer calls me that.

1042
01:02:55,962 --> 01:02:58,795
I have been "niggered" by royalty.

1043
01:03:01,716 --> 01:03:02,549
- Ah.

1044
01:03:04,087 --> 01:03:06,837
(Chill laughing)

1045
01:03:08,861 --> 01:03:11,694
(Elijah laughing)

1046
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,490
Oh shit.

1047
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:16,323
Oh shit.

1048
01:03:17,887 --> 01:03:22,887

1049

1050
01:03:29,855 --> 01:03:31,370
- Yeah.

1051
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:33,175
- Oh, so that's how you know how to...

1052
01:03:33,175 --> 01:03:34,258
- Yeah, yeah.

1053
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:42,103
- I bet you seen some shit then, huh?

1054
01:03:43,671 --> 01:03:46,838
(gentle guitar music)

1055
01:03:49,068 --> 01:03:51,068
- What's your real name?

1056
01:03:54,276 --> 01:03:57,276
You weren't born Chill, I know that.

1057
01:03:58,628 --> 01:04:00,290
- Nah.

1058
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:04,748
It's not like I gave
myself that name, you know.

1059
01:04:04,748 --> 01:04:07,245
I don't know, it just happened.

1060
01:04:07,245 --> 01:04:10,243
I guess when it came to
taking care of business,

1061
01:04:10,243 --> 01:04:12,548
I never got upset, you know.

1062
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:13,820
It's dumb as shit, man.

1063
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:16,567
Junkies not paying, shit like that.

1064
01:04:16,567 --> 01:04:18,662
I took care of that shit.

1065
01:04:18,662 --> 01:04:20,665
But I always stay...

1066
01:04:20,665 --> 01:04:22,665
- Chill, yeah, I got it.

1067
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,320
- Yeah, I got it, right.

1068
01:04:29,002 --> 01:04:29,835
Sam.

1069
01:04:31,531 --> 01:04:32,698
Samuel Malick.

1070
01:04:35,231 --> 01:04:36,064
- Hmm.

1071
01:04:36,988 --> 01:04:37,821
Malick.

1072
01:04:38,688 --> 01:04:42,167
- Yeah, you can see why I
didn't fight Chill, right?

1073
01:04:42,167 --> 01:04:44,940
- Doesn't sound Catholic.

1074
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:46,690
Raised Catholic then?

1075
01:04:50,078 --> 01:04:52,980
The first day I brought you here,

1076
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:56,288
you were bloody and out of it.

1077
01:04:56,288 --> 01:05:00,787
I was washing up and you stumbled
into that bathroom saying,

1078
01:05:00,787 --> 01:05:02,537
"Forgive me, Father."

1079
01:05:04,648 --> 01:05:06,481
- Yeah I was, so what?

1080
01:05:07,939 --> 01:05:09,996
- Explains a lot.

1081
01:05:09,996 --> 01:05:12,551
- Man, that doesn't explain shit.

1082
01:05:12,551 --> 01:05:16,051
You gonna slide into another God talk now?

1083
01:05:18,471 --> 01:05:19,804
Yeah, all right.

1084
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:24,166
So after my moms left and my dad ODed,

1085
01:05:24,166 --> 01:05:27,041
me and my sister went to
live in the fucking hell

1086
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:29,958
that is All Saints Children's Home.

1087
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:32,474
What?

1088
01:05:32,474 --> 01:05:36,141
You wanna know if I got
diddled by a priest?

1089
01:05:37,628 --> 01:05:38,461
No, man.

1090
01:05:41,311 --> 01:05:42,811
But my sister did.

1091
01:05:45,301 --> 01:05:48,551
Yeah, they fucked her up good in there.

1092
01:05:50,736 --> 01:05:53,347
So does that fit with your story?

1093
01:05:53,347 --> 01:05:54,540
- What?

1094
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:58,040
The why does Samiel Malick hate God story?

1095
01:06:00,367 --> 01:06:02,481
Yeah, pretty much.

1096
01:06:02,481 --> 01:06:04,564
- [Chill] Yeah, fuck you.

1097
01:06:07,676 --> 01:06:09,970
(Elijah sighing)

1098
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:13,530
- I'm sorry that happened to you.

1099
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:16,363
What happened to her, your sister?

1100
01:06:17,668 --> 01:06:18,585
- She died.

1101
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:22,754
Whore in a crack house, eight years later.

1102
01:06:22,754 --> 01:06:23,587
- Jesus.

1103
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:26,767
- Yeah.

1104
01:06:26,767 --> 01:06:28,184
Jesus, all right.

1105
01:06:30,322 --> 01:06:31,572
Fuck that dude.

1106
01:06:37,612 --> 01:06:38,862
- You're right.

1107
01:06:41,932 --> 01:06:43,091
Fuck

1108
01:06:43,091 --> 01:06:44,312
that

1109
01:06:44,312 --> 01:06:45,145
guy.

1110
01:06:47,058 --> 01:06:47,984
- What'd you say?

1111
01:06:47,984 --> 01:06:49,863
- You heard me.

1112
01:06:49,863 --> 01:06:52,079
He didn't help you.

1113
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:53,756
Didn't help your sister.

1114
01:06:53,756 --> 01:06:55,006
Didn't help me.

1115
01:06:56,484 --> 01:06:59,783
Horrible shit happens
to everybody, every day

1116
01:06:59,783 --> 01:07:01,450
and He does nothing.

1117
01:07:02,516 --> 01:07:05,599
There is no plan and He doesn't care.

1118
01:07:07,554 --> 01:07:08,887
There's just us,

1119
01:07:09,761 --> 01:07:11,292
here,

1120
01:07:11,292 --> 01:07:12,743
now,

1121
01:07:12,743 --> 01:07:13,826
by ourselves.

1122
01:07:15,135 --> 01:07:15,968
So, yeah,

1123
01:07:17,151 --> 01:07:18,151
F that dude.

1124
01:07:24,738 --> 01:07:25,738
- Holy shit.

1125
01:07:28,121 --> 01:07:30,676
Dude, that's for real.

1126
01:07:30,676 --> 01:07:32,009
That's for real.

1127
01:07:37,612 --> 01:07:39,330
So you stay in the army?

1128
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:40,620
- What?

1129
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:42,030
No.

1130
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:42,863
No.

1131
01:07:43,761 --> 01:07:45,996
Stayed through my early 20s,

1132
01:07:45,996 --> 01:07:48,125
left, discharged,

1133
01:07:48,125 --> 01:07:50,406
joined the Peace Corps.

1134
01:07:50,406 --> 01:07:54,875
And by the time I was 30,
was a radical liberal.

1135
01:07:54,875 --> 01:07:58,458
Pretty much the opposite
of the old saying.

1136
01:08:00,258 --> 01:08:03,258
- So you gonna tell me what changed?

1137
01:08:04,628 --> 01:08:06,688
Yo, what'd you see?

1138
01:08:06,688 --> 01:08:09,438
(fire crackling)

1139
01:08:11,706 --> 01:08:14,842
- You are a horrible human being, yes?

1140
01:08:14,842 --> 01:08:15,675
Yes.

1141
01:08:16,825 --> 01:08:18,713
You sell drugs to children, yes?

1142
01:08:18,713 --> 01:08:19,981
Yes.

1143
01:08:19,981 --> 01:08:22,245
You have them sell them to each other.

1144
01:08:22,245 --> 01:08:25,162
You hurt people who don't pay, yes?

1145
01:08:27,274 --> 01:08:29,274
Ever kill anyone though?

1146
01:08:35,552 --> 01:08:36,385
- No.

1147
01:08:37,556 --> 01:08:38,389
- Hmm.

1148
01:08:40,335 --> 01:08:43,168
(Elijah groaning)

1149
01:08:47,642 --> 01:08:49,059
Along the boarder

1150
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,210
was a large trench network,

1151
01:08:53,594 --> 01:08:55,594
the Saddam Hussein Line,

1152
01:08:57,495 --> 01:09:01,412
with giant plows mounted
on the front of tanks.

1153
01:09:03,956 --> 01:09:07,039
We buried thousands of Iraqi soldiers

1154
01:09:09,193 --> 01:09:10,026
alive.

1155
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:14,080
Some of them trying to surrender.

1156
01:09:15,218 --> 01:09:16,051
Thousands.

1157
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,728
- You was drawn on them?

1158
01:09:19,728 --> 01:09:20,561
- No.

1159
01:09:22,014 --> 01:09:23,764
But I was part of it.

1160
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:25,751
Yes.

1161
01:09:25,751 --> 01:09:27,592
(dramatic music)

1162
01:09:27,592 --> 01:09:32,186
Buried trenches with arms and
things sticking out of them.

1163
01:09:32,186 --> 01:09:34,784
One guy was halfway out, flailing.

1164
01:09:34,784 --> 01:09:36,234
(man speaking foreign language)

1165
01:09:36,234 --> 01:09:41,008
I went to pull him out and the
lower half of him was gone.

1166
01:09:41,008 --> 01:09:43,882
He was crying and babbling in pain.

1167
01:09:43,882 --> 01:09:44,945
(man speaking foreign language)

1168
01:09:44,945 --> 01:09:47,778
(gunshot booming)

1169
01:09:48,752 --> 01:09:50,002
I put him down.

1170
01:09:58,538 --> 01:10:01,463
- You met your wife in the Peace Corps?

1171
01:10:01,463 --> 01:10:03,906
(dramatic music)

1172
01:10:03,906 --> 01:10:04,739
- No.

1173
01:10:05,893 --> 01:10:10,202
At a protest against the
second Iraq War in '03.

1174
01:10:10,202 --> 01:10:11,035
- No shit.

1175
01:10:12,858 --> 01:10:13,691
- Yeah.

1176
01:10:14,999 --> 01:10:17,416
She turned everything around.

1177
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:20,877
Got me focused and direction.

1178
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:25,885
Nothing I did, everything after that,

1179
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:28,639
was because of her.

1180
01:10:30,632 --> 01:10:35,046
- Yeah, but you weren't
no saint, you know.

1181
01:10:35,046 --> 01:10:36,277
I bet you there was plenty of times

1182
01:10:36,277 --> 01:10:39,386
you were just sick of her shit, right?

1183
01:10:39,386 --> 01:10:40,969
- Watch your mouth.

1184
01:10:44,581 --> 01:10:47,733
- You got kids, you and her?

1185
01:10:47,733 --> 01:10:50,483
(dramatic music)

1186
01:10:52,096 --> 01:10:53,013
Thought so.

1187
01:10:55,786 --> 01:11:00,229
Yo, you remember that
night we saw each other?

1188
01:11:00,229 --> 01:11:01,646
- Of course I do.

1189
01:11:03,472 --> 01:11:04,738
- It's okay.
- Yeah.

1190
01:11:04,738 --> 01:11:05,775
- All right, I called your mom.

1191
01:11:05,775 --> 01:11:06,666
She's on her way.

1192
01:11:06,666 --> 01:11:08,725
- Oh my gosh, Marquis, my boy, my boy!

1193
01:11:08,725 --> 01:11:09,583
- Mom.

1194
01:11:09,583 --> 01:11:10,416
- Oh my God.

1195
01:11:10,416 --> 01:11:11,402
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- It's okay.

1196
01:11:11,402 --> 01:11:12,512
It's okay, Danitra.
- How did they...

1197
01:11:12,512 --> 01:11:13,922
- It's not that bad.

1198
01:11:13,922 --> 01:11:15,245
It's not that bad.

1199
01:11:15,245 --> 01:11:17,195
Elijah took care of him.

1200
01:11:17,195 --> 01:11:18,579
- Oh thank you, God.

1201
01:11:18,579 --> 01:11:19,412
- It's all right.
- I don't know

1202
01:11:19,412 --> 01:11:20,245
what I would've done.

1203
01:11:20,245 --> 01:11:21,078
Thank you, Jesus.

1204
01:11:21,078 --> 01:11:23,089
- I'm gonna go get cleaned up.

1205
01:11:23,089 --> 01:11:25,822
(Danitra crying)

1206
01:11:25,822 --> 01:11:28,572
(dramatic music)

1207
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,187
(ominous music)

1208
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:48,885
(door clicking)

1209
01:11:56,107 --> 01:11:59,524
(foreboding tempo music)

1210
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:16,988
- Yo, that is fucking bullshit.

1211
01:12:16,988 --> 01:12:18,324
- What?

1212
01:12:18,324 --> 01:12:19,532
- This.

1213
01:12:19,532 --> 01:12:22,638
This story you've been telling
yourself all these years.

1214
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:24,414
This is how you remember that night?

1215
01:12:24,414 --> 01:12:25,429
- This is what happened.

1216
01:12:25,429 --> 01:12:27,543
You shot that boy and then threatened me.

1217
01:12:27,543 --> 01:12:28,376
- I...

1218
01:12:28,376 --> 01:12:29,709
I shot that boy?

1219
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,796
Is that what he told you?

1220
01:12:32,796 --> 01:12:33,737
That boy?

1221
01:12:33,737 --> 01:12:36,000
- No, he wouldn't tell me
what happened, I just assumed.

1222
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,980
- Oh, I assumed.

1223
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:39,760
Who is that boy?

1224
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,714
Who is that woman?

1225
01:12:41,714 --> 01:12:43,322
- Marquis and his mother, Danitra.

1226
01:12:43,322 --> 01:12:44,650
Why, what does it matter to you?

1227
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:46,136
- Why does it?

1228
01:12:46,136 --> 01:12:46,969
Oh my god.

1229
01:12:47,978 --> 01:12:49,039
Yo, see it again.

1230
01:12:49,039 --> 01:12:50,031
- What?

1231
01:12:50,031 --> 01:12:51,281
- See it again.

1232
01:13:02,181 --> 01:13:05,264
(gentle piano music)

1233
01:13:47,856 --> 01:13:49,605
For the past three days,

1234
01:13:49,605 --> 01:13:52,805
I didn't know what the fuck was going on.

1235
01:13:52,805 --> 01:13:55,970
I thought this was some
sort of psycho mind-fuck

1236
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:58,941
to torture me or some shit.

1237
01:13:58,941 --> 01:14:00,191
But now I know.

1238
01:14:02,024 --> 01:14:03,357
You didn't know.

1239
01:14:04,962 --> 01:14:06,879
You really didn't know.

1240
01:14:08,194 --> 01:14:09,027
- You...

1241
01:14:10,557 --> 01:14:12,390
You shot your own son?

1242
01:14:14,837 --> 01:14:16,004
- Jesus, what?

1243
01:14:19,415 --> 01:14:21,998
It was a drive-by meant for me.

1244
01:14:23,056 --> 01:14:26,306
Marquis was at my house when I was out.

1245
01:14:28,885 --> 01:14:31,302
He was always hanging around.

1246
01:14:32,586 --> 01:14:35,792
Danitra hated that shit though.

1247
01:14:35,792 --> 01:14:40,493
She wanted to get him as
far from me as she could.

1248
01:14:40,493 --> 01:14:42,826
Of course, after that night.

1249
01:14:44,195 --> 01:14:45,362
- Danitra was?

1250
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,517
- I was 22, she was 18.

1251
01:14:49,762 --> 01:14:52,845
She was a customer, she paid in tail.

1252
01:14:54,353 --> 01:14:58,117
After she got knocked up
with Marquis, she cleaned up.

1253
01:14:58,117 --> 01:14:59,800
Found Jesus.

1254
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,125
And you.

1255
01:15:01,125 --> 01:15:05,412
Well now I know, not
you but your other half.

1256
01:15:05,412 --> 01:15:06,245
- My?

1257
01:15:08,442 --> 01:15:11,442
- Damn, not so smart after all, huh?

1258
01:15:12,318 --> 01:15:15,072
I wonder what else she didn't tell you.

1259
01:15:15,072 --> 01:15:16,704
- Who?

1260
01:15:16,704 --> 01:15:21,405
- Your dead wife who you talk
to all the time up in here!

1261
01:15:21,405 --> 01:15:25,480
(dramatic piano music)

1262
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:26,563
- We're done.

1263
01:15:40,306 --> 01:15:44,040
(crickets chirping)

1264
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:47,290
(dramatic piano music)

1265
01:16:20,989 --> 01:16:23,765
(door thudding)

1266
01:16:23,765 --> 01:16:24,682
- You knew.

1267
01:16:25,658 --> 01:16:27,839
You knew who they were,

1268
01:16:27,839 --> 01:16:28,756
who he was.

1269
01:16:30,765 --> 01:16:33,038
- How could you not?

1270
01:16:33,038 --> 01:16:34,085
No.

1271
01:16:34,085 --> 01:16:34,918
No.

1272
01:16:35,795 --> 01:16:38,461
Don't try to answer that.

1273
01:16:38,461 --> 01:16:39,826
Yes.

1274
01:16:39,826 --> 01:16:41,903
I knew who Danitra was.

1275
01:16:41,903 --> 01:16:43,783
I knew her past.

1276
01:16:43,783 --> 01:16:45,700
I knew who her son was.

1277
01:16:48,699 --> 01:16:49,949
And you didn't.

1278
01:16:51,621 --> 01:16:52,954
But that's okay.

1279
01:16:54,018 --> 01:16:57,015
From sermons to budgets to maintenance

1280
01:16:57,015 --> 01:16:58,623
to everything else,

1281
01:16:58,623 --> 01:17:00,206
you oversaw it all.

1282
01:17:02,063 --> 01:17:05,525
But who do you think
sweated the small stuff?

1283
01:17:05,525 --> 01:17:07,354
Who do you think ran interference

1284
01:17:07,354 --> 01:17:09,854
so you could stay big picture?

1285
01:17:11,909 --> 01:17:14,712
I knew what I was doing.

1286
01:17:14,712 --> 01:17:17,568
You were the face and I was...

1287
01:17:17,568 --> 01:17:18,552
- The brains.

1288
01:17:18,552 --> 01:17:22,157
- No, no, no, no, don't put that on me.

1289
01:17:22,157 --> 01:17:23,907
We did this together.

1290
01:17:26,044 --> 01:17:30,528
You decided to bring something
better into this world.

1291
01:17:30,528 --> 01:17:34,687
All I did was just take your
hand and said, let's go.

1292
01:17:34,687 --> 01:17:36,375
- And did we?

1293
01:17:36,375 --> 01:17:40,032
Bring anything better into this world?

1294
01:17:40,032 --> 01:17:41,292
- You tell me.

1295
01:17:41,292 --> 01:17:44,542
(dramatic piano music)

1296
01:17:52,215 --> 01:17:54,249
- They were just words.

1297
01:17:54,249 --> 01:17:56,409
Empty, useless words.

1298
01:17:56,409 --> 01:17:57,737
- No, no, Eli,

1299
01:17:57,737 --> 01:18:00,257
you don't get to decide that.

1300
01:18:00,257 --> 01:18:03,375
Just because the messenger
feels like a fraud,

1301
01:18:03,375 --> 01:18:06,180
doesn't mean the message can't be heard.

1302
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:07,013
Here.

1303
01:18:12,276 --> 01:18:16,026
It doesn't matter how
you felt inside, honey.

1304
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:20,705
All that matters is
that you did something.

1305
01:18:20,705 --> 01:18:23,679
At the end of the day, you
and I got off our asses

1306
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:26,096
and we tried to do something.

1307
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:30,953
- It's not fair.

1308
01:18:31,848 --> 01:18:33,916
Why does he get to have a child, a son,

1309
01:18:33,916 --> 01:18:36,065
and we get nothing?

1310
01:18:36,065 --> 01:18:37,788
- Because we didn't.

1311
01:18:37,788 --> 01:18:38,705
That's why.

1312
01:18:40,095 --> 01:18:41,532
If you knew who he was,

1313
01:18:41,532 --> 01:18:44,439
would you have done anything different?

1314
01:18:44,439 --> 01:18:46,889
Turned him into the police?

1315
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:48,806
Let him bleed to death?

1316
01:18:50,606 --> 01:18:52,178
Right.

1317
01:18:52,178 --> 01:18:54,845
So, what're you going to do now?

1318
01:18:57,038 --> 01:18:58,621
- What do you mean?

1319
01:19:06,521 --> 01:19:09,321
- You know why I sweated the small stuff?

1320
01:19:09,321 --> 01:19:12,121
Why you never saw what I just showed you?

1321
01:19:12,121 --> 01:19:15,617
- I assumed because my head
was up my ass again, yes?

1322
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:16,784
- Yes, that...

1323
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:20,190
And sometimes that caused you to see

1324
01:19:20,190 --> 01:19:22,551
only what you want to see.

1325
01:19:22,551 --> 01:19:25,634
- Well, it's a limited view up there.

1326
01:19:27,390 --> 01:19:28,323
- Now that I'm gone,

1327
01:19:28,323 --> 01:19:31,169
it's time for you to see
the details for yourself.

1328
01:19:31,169 --> 01:19:34,208
- No, no, you're not
gone, you're right here.

1329
01:19:34,208 --> 01:19:36,375
You're not going anywhere.

1330
01:19:37,748 --> 01:19:39,382
- I'm gone, Elijah.

1331
01:19:39,382 --> 01:19:42,132
(lights buzzing)

1332
01:20:04,344 --> 01:20:07,094
(dramatic music)

1333
01:20:11,874 --> 01:20:13,457
- Why are you here?

1334
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:16,353
I said...

1335
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:17,841
- [Sam] I heard you.

1336
01:20:17,841 --> 01:20:20,109
- That road is next to nothing.

1337
01:20:20,109 --> 01:20:21,967
We're in the middle of nowhere.

1338
01:20:21,967 --> 01:20:24,665
You didn't accidentally
end up on my doorstep.

1339
01:20:24,665 --> 01:20:26,756
Why are you here?

1340
01:20:26,756 --> 01:20:28,638
- I was sent here, remember?

1341
01:20:28,638 --> 01:20:30,043
I'm your test.

1342
01:20:30,043 --> 01:20:31,384
- Bullshit.

1343
01:20:31,384 --> 01:20:33,051
You knew I was here.

1344
01:20:34,575 --> 01:20:36,242
You came to kill me.

1345
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:40,341
- Kill you?

1346
01:20:41,802 --> 01:20:42,635
Kill you?

1347
01:20:44,574 --> 01:20:46,958
My god, man, you are
so full of fucking ego.

1348
01:20:46,958 --> 01:20:48,358
- Forgive me, Father?

1349
01:20:48,358 --> 01:20:50,654
With your gun waving around?

1350
01:20:50,654 --> 01:20:53,287
You knew who I was, you knew!

1351
01:20:53,287 --> 01:20:54,184
- We're done.

1352
01:20:54,184 --> 01:20:55,376
- Uh-uh.

1353
01:20:55,376 --> 01:20:56,931
Where are you going?

1354
01:20:56,931 --> 01:20:58,549
Where you gonna go?

1355
01:20:58,549 --> 01:21:00,550
It's just you and me up here, Sam.

1356
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:01,797
- Get the fuck out of my way, nigger.

1357
01:21:01,797 --> 01:21:03,728
- Oh, we're past that, Sam.

1358
01:21:03,728 --> 01:21:05,422
Why are you here?

1359
01:21:05,422 --> 01:21:06,944
You took everything from me.

1360
01:21:06,944 --> 01:21:10,010
My faith, my purpose, my wife.

1361
01:21:10,010 --> 01:21:12,007
You come to finish the job?

1362
01:21:12,007 --> 01:21:13,656
- Oh yeah, that's it.

1363
01:21:13,656 --> 01:21:14,952
Yeah, that's what I been looking for.

1364
01:21:14,952 --> 01:21:16,192
Let's go, come on now, nigger.

1365
01:21:16,192 --> 01:21:18,280
- You took everything from me!

1366
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:19,613
- You cursed me!

1367
01:21:22,478 --> 01:21:24,080
Since the minute you came in that church,

1368
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,531
you've been like a
fucking plague on my life.

1369
01:21:26,531 --> 01:21:27,430
- Dude, you said...

1370
01:21:27,430 --> 01:21:30,083
- Oh, enough with your
fucking bullshit self-pity!

1371
01:21:30,083 --> 01:21:33,587
You know exactly what you
did to me, to my business!

1372
01:21:33,587 --> 01:21:36,086
What that wife of yours did to my family!

1373
01:21:36,086 --> 01:21:36,919
- Robin?

1374
01:21:36,919 --> 01:21:39,895
- I was everything to that boy!

1375
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,090
Marquis was mine!

1376
01:21:42,090 --> 01:21:45,341
Everything I did was gonna be for him.

1377
01:21:45,341 --> 01:21:49,178
And then that wife of yours
got her claws into his momma.

1378
01:21:49,178 --> 01:21:52,376
She found Jesus, he found
your little fucking group

1379
01:21:52,376 --> 01:21:54,317
and I became shit!

1380
01:21:54,317 --> 01:21:57,067
I became the motherfucking devil.

1381
01:21:58,090 --> 01:22:02,239
And after that night that he
got shot, well that was it.

1382
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:03,456
They was gone.

1383
01:22:03,456 --> 01:22:05,400
Gone because of you.

1384
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,426
- No, that's not...

1385
01:22:06,426 --> 01:22:08,799
- Oh Jesus, you are so fucking blind.

1386
01:22:08,799 --> 01:22:12,803
- No, no, that night, Robin's
accident, they weren't gone.

1387
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:14,145
She got a call

1388
01:22:14,145 --> 01:22:16,751
saying that that boy, that
Marquis was in trouble.

1389
01:22:16,751 --> 01:22:20,251
That he was dealing again.
- Dealing again.

1390
01:22:21,918 --> 01:22:25,052
(wind howling)

1391
01:22:25,052 --> 01:22:27,552
- Who called Robin that night?

1392
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,562
(dramatic music)

1393
01:22:32,562 --> 01:22:35,562
- A junkie pretending to be Marquis.

1394
01:22:37,172 --> 01:22:38,089
He owed me.

1395
01:22:40,349 --> 01:22:43,480
Yo, man, I didn't have a plan.

1396
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:46,258
You know, I just wanted to scare her.

1397
01:22:46,258 --> 01:22:47,091
That's it.

1398
01:22:48,429 --> 01:22:49,262
- What?

1399
01:22:50,953 --> 01:22:52,286
What did you do?

1400
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,464
- I just wanted to scare her.

1401
01:22:56,464 --> 01:22:58,894
Make her think twice about
getting into my business,

1402
01:22:58,894 --> 01:22:59,727
my life.

1403
01:23:01,841 --> 01:23:02,674
God.

1404
01:23:03,618 --> 01:23:05,687
The road was slick, yeah.

1405
01:23:05,687 --> 01:23:08,437
The road was slick, she spun out.

1406
01:23:10,533 --> 01:23:11,616
I watched it.

1407
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:15,323
I watched.

1408
01:23:19,477 --> 01:23:22,394
(Elijah screaming)

1409
01:23:23,881 --> 01:23:25,398
(punches thudding)

1410
01:23:25,398 --> 01:23:27,264
(Sam coughing)

1411
01:23:27,264 --> 01:23:29,706
(Elijah groaning)

1412
01:23:29,706 --> 01:23:30,539
No!

1413
01:23:31,865 --> 01:23:32,946
Not here.

1414
01:23:32,946 --> 01:23:33,779
- Come back!

1415
01:23:33,779 --> 01:23:35,240
- No!

1416
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:37,823
(wind howling)

1417
01:23:47,159 --> 01:23:49,742
(wind howling)

1418
01:23:59,339 --> 01:24:00,172
Go.

1419
01:24:01,998 --> 01:24:05,091
Leave me, just go please, dude.

1420
01:24:05,091 --> 01:24:06,914
Please, just go.

1421
01:24:06,914 --> 01:24:08,758
Yeah, come on now.

1422
01:24:08,758 --> 01:24:10,536
Come on, nigger, do it.

1423
01:24:10,536 --> 01:24:11,869
Come on, please.

1424
01:24:13,001 --> 01:24:14,099
Come on, nigger, do it.

1425
01:24:14,099 --> 01:24:15,395
- [Elijah] Get up.

1426
01:24:15,395 --> 01:24:16,228
- Just do it.

1427
01:24:16,228 --> 01:24:18,228
- Get off her grave now.

1428
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:20,163
- Yo, please.

1429
01:24:21,083 --> 01:24:22,662
Please do it, make it go away,

1430
01:24:22,662 --> 01:24:24,224
dude.
- Get up.

1431
01:24:24,224 --> 01:24:26,731
- Yo, this is why I'm here.

1432
01:24:26,731 --> 01:24:27,731
You have to.

1433
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:34,537
Ever since that night,
I see her everywhere.

1434
01:24:37,931 --> 01:24:39,496
- You?

1435
01:24:39,496 --> 01:24:41,246
- You did this to me.

1436
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:44,770
She did this to me, man.

1437
01:24:46,292 --> 01:24:47,684
Everything's gone, man.

1438
01:24:47,684 --> 01:24:52,684
Yo, I wasn't even using till
Danitra took Marquis from me.

1439
01:24:52,848 --> 01:24:55,738
Goddamn it, now look at me.

1440
01:24:55,738 --> 01:24:57,184
Fuck.

1441
01:24:57,184 --> 01:24:58,017
- You.

1442
01:24:59,104 --> 01:25:00,800
You did this to yourself.

1443
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,806
You brought this on yourself.

1444
01:25:01,806 --> 01:25:02,639
You!

1445
01:25:04,326 --> 01:25:06,170
- I just wanted to scare her.

1446
01:25:06,170 --> 01:25:07,003
- Shut up.

1447
01:25:08,598 --> 01:25:10,091
- Now Danitra's gone.

1448
01:25:10,091 --> 01:25:11,254
- Oh.

1449
01:25:11,254 --> 01:25:13,766
- His momma's gone, dude.

1450
01:25:13,766 --> 01:25:15,359
She fuck...

1451
01:25:15,359 --> 01:25:18,500
She fucking shacked up with
some motherfucking psycho.

1452
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:19,333
He killed her.

1453
01:25:19,333 --> 01:25:20,192
- Shut up.

1454
01:25:20,192 --> 01:25:21,166
- Fucking killed her, dude.

1455
01:25:21,166 --> 01:25:22,071
- Shut up!

1456
01:25:22,071 --> 01:25:25,119
- Marquis, my boy is in foster.

1457
01:25:25,119 --> 01:25:26,936
In foster, it's shit!

1458
01:25:26,936 --> 01:25:28,126
It's all shit.

1459
01:25:28,126 --> 01:25:29,293
- God help me.

1460
01:25:33,609 --> 01:25:34,776
- I found her.

1461
01:25:36,342 --> 01:25:39,592
I don't know, I thought if I came here,

1462
01:25:40,694 --> 01:25:44,444
if I gave myself to her,
here, if I ended it,

1463
01:25:45,633 --> 01:25:46,966
she'd let us go.

1464
01:25:48,751 --> 01:25:50,928
She would let him go.

1465
01:25:50,928 --> 01:25:52,678
She'd let Marquis go.

1466
01:25:53,518 --> 01:25:55,268
- Tell me what to do.

1467
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:58,776
- You gotta do it.

1468
01:25:58,776 --> 01:26:01,702
That's what you gotta do, just do it.

1469
01:26:01,702 --> 01:26:02,702
Please, man.

1470
01:26:03,851 --> 01:26:04,768
Look at me.

1471
01:26:05,743 --> 01:26:07,990
I'm worthless, dude.

1472
01:26:07,990 --> 01:26:10,835
I'm fucking gone already.

1473
01:26:10,835 --> 01:26:11,668
Please.

1474
01:26:11,668 --> 01:26:12,501
- No.

1475
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:13,334
- For him.

1476
01:26:13,334 --> 01:26:14,167
- No!
- Please, for him.

1477
01:26:14,167 --> 01:26:15,014
- No!

1478
01:26:15,014 --> 01:26:18,248
You can't make me feel sorry for you.

1479
01:26:18,248 --> 01:26:19,081
No, no!

1480
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:23,372
You killed her and it killed me.

1481
01:26:23,372 --> 01:26:25,084
You killed me!

1482
01:26:25,084 --> 01:26:26,767
- Yeah, I did.

1483
01:26:26,767 --> 01:26:27,767
Yeah, I did.

1484
01:26:29,550 --> 01:26:30,967
I was there, man.

1485
01:26:32,515 --> 01:26:34,057
The accident?

1486
01:26:34,057 --> 01:26:37,851
It was right outside
my fucking house, dude.

1487
01:26:37,851 --> 01:26:38,838
- Shut up.

1488
01:26:38,838 --> 01:26:40,347
- I watched it.

1489
01:26:40,347 --> 01:26:43,614
I saw it happen through my
fucking window, I watched it.

1490
01:26:43,614 --> 01:26:44,771
- Shut up!

1491
01:26:44,771 --> 01:26:46,188
- I went outside,

1492
01:26:47,254 --> 01:26:49,717
she was still alive.

1493
01:26:49,717 --> 01:26:52,035
- Tell me what to do.
- She was still alive

1494
01:26:52,035 --> 01:26:54,176
when I walked over to her.

1495
01:26:54,176 --> 01:26:56,093
She looked right at me.

1496
01:26:58,204 --> 01:27:00,715
She looked right at me and I watched.

1497
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:01,548
- Oh God.

1498
01:27:03,459 --> 01:27:05,542
- And then I walked away.

1499
01:27:07,187 --> 01:27:09,323
- Where are You?

1500
01:27:09,323 --> 01:27:10,906
Tell me what to do!

1501
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,891
(Elijah crying)

1502
01:27:13,891 --> 01:27:14,724
- Elijah?

1503
01:27:17,502 --> 01:27:18,585
Elijah Frank.

1504
01:27:20,875 --> 01:27:21,792
Just do it.

1505
01:27:25,092 --> 01:27:26,425
Make it go away.

1506
01:27:28,931 --> 01:27:29,764
Please.

1507
01:27:32,571 --> 01:27:33,404
Please.

1508
01:27:35,816 --> 01:27:36,649
Please.

1509
01:27:38,201 --> 01:27:39,034
Please.

1510
01:27:40,270 --> 01:27:43,020
(Elijah gasping)

1511
01:27:45,974 --> 01:27:47,362
(gun cranking)

1512
01:27:47,362 --> 01:27:50,279
(Elijah groaning)

1513
01:28:03,173 --> 01:28:06,090
(Elijah screaming)

1514
01:28:07,163 --> 01:28:09,830
(Elijah crying)

1515
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,783
- I'm sorry, Robin.

1516
01:28:21,943 --> 01:28:23,776
I'm sorry, I couldn't.

1517
01:28:25,749 --> 01:28:27,314
I couldn't.

1518
01:28:27,314 --> 01:28:29,961
I'm sorry, Robin.
(dramatic music)

1519
01:28:29,961 --> 01:28:30,878
I couldn't.

1520
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:32,887
I couldn't.

1521
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:35,893
I couldn't.

1522
01:28:39,957 --> 01:28:42,707
(Elijah sobbing)

1523
01:28:48,392 --> 01:28:50,809
(Sam crying)

1524
01:28:54,267 --> 01:28:55,100
- Oh God.

1525
01:28:56,486 --> 01:28:57,653
Oh, I'm sorry.

1526
01:28:58,563 --> 01:28:59,563
- It's okay.

1527
01:29:01,309 --> 01:29:02,142
It's okay.

1528
01:29:03,764 --> 01:29:06,514
(dramatic music)

1529
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:09,927
- I'm...

1530
01:29:18,727 --> 01:29:21,477
(birds chirping)

1531
01:29:33,284 --> 01:29:35,867
(wind howling)

1532
01:29:56,087 --> 01:29:58,420
It's gonna be a long winter.

1533
01:29:59,682 --> 01:30:01,432
We've got work to do.

1534
01:30:07,053 --> 01:30:09,636
(wind howling)

1535
01:30:19,814 --> 01:30:22,897

(somber piano music)

1537
01:31:59,224 --> 01:32:02,474
(pleasant piano music)
