Katelin, voice over: Hi. My
name is Katelin Kingsford,

3
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:10,642
but my friends call me...
Dork.

4
00:00:10,727 --> 00:00:13,746
Katelin: Well, they're not
exactly friends.

5
00:00:13,863 --> 00:00:14,903
They're the competition...

6
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:17,866
Fall! Fall! Fall!

7
00:00:17,901 --> 00:00:19,968
Katelin:
And I'm the girl to beat.

8
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,839
Show-off.

9
00:00:23,907 --> 00:00:26,992
Katelin: I was told that jealousy
is the highest form of flattery.

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,911
Of course it hurts a little.

11
00:00:28,978 --> 00:00:30,378
But if they didn't hate me so much,

12
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:32,214
then how would I know how good I was?

13
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,650
These are 'rents, ed and Linda.

14
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:36,518
They're loving, supportive...

15
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:37,986
Whoo!

16
00:00:38,087 --> 00:00:39,488
Whoo!

17
00:00:39,556 --> 00:00:41,540
That's my girl!

18
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,144
Katelin: And incredibly
embarrassing.

19
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:45,577
The craniac next to them
is my brother Bradley.

20
00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:46,795
Sure he's a geek,

21
00:00:46,863 --> 00:00:49,198
but he also has the best
slap shot in the state.

22
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:52,100
Bradley has no respect for us twirl girls.

23
00:00:52,202 --> 00:00:54,036
Still, my parents always make him come.

24
00:00:56,339 --> 00:00:59,241
My coaches Bob and ginger
have trained me forever.

25
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,176
Ginger does my hair and makeup.

26
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:03,045
She makes me sparkle.

27
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,681
Bob, my choreographer, says
he has more moves in him

28
00:01:05,749 --> 00:01:07,349
than all the rockettes combined...

29
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:08,350
Whoever they are.

30
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:09,651
Pop and pop!

31
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:10,999
Katelin:
I love Bob and ginger.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,121
They are spectacular human beings.

33
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,723
But the truth is...

34
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,358
They're never gonna get my picture

35
00:01:16,426 --> 00:01:18,093
on the cover of a cereal box.

36
00:01:18,127 --> 00:01:21,296
For that, you need a Russian.

37
00:01:21,364 --> 00:01:24,199
Natasha Goberman makes
figure skating champions

38
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,585
as easily as I can fake a smile.

39
00:01:26,703 --> 00:01:28,754
It is my dream to one day
train with someone

40
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,607
of her caliber and nationality.

41
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,176
After all, I am the best.

42
00:01:35,612 --> 00:01:38,263
But I need a scrunchy.

43
00:01:38,297 --> 00:01:39,915
How about a barrette?

44
00:01:39,983 --> 00:01:42,951
Aah! Don't you know
anything about skating?

45
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,154
I do.

46
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:47,422
Here, take mine.

47
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,490
Really?

48
00:01:48,558 --> 00:01:49,591
Yeah, sure.

49
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:51,362
I'll just use my lucky rubber band instead.

50
00:01:51,363 --> 00:01:52,044
Thanks.

51
00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:54,263
No prob.
Now go get 'em.

52
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,330
Katelin: Let's face it.

53
00:01:55,398 --> 00:01:56,958
The karmic brownie points I just earned

54
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,167
would be invaluable in today's competition.

55
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:00,736
Not that I need any help.

56
00:02:00,804 --> 00:02:03,021
I'm a lock to win.

57
00:02:05,975 --> 00:02:07,976
Katelin: Or so I thought.

58
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:11,480
My lucky rubber band was kinda old.

59
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:15,417
And who knew that rubber didn't retain
its integrity as long as a scrunchy?

60
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:17,686
Oh, well.
The damage was done.

61
00:02:31,835 --> 00:02:34,903
[Applause]

62
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,980
Push!

63
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,883
Was it my Axel?

64
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:49,718
And your lutzes and your spins.

65
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:51,286
And that dress?
Come on.

66
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:53,234
Katelin: While the criticism
wasn't very nice,

67
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,489
it certainly wasn't unfounded.

68
00:02:54,557 --> 00:02:56,959
They say you're either
a Britney or a Christina.

69
00:02:57,026 --> 00:02:58,293
But here on the ice,

70
00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:00,596
you're either a Kristi
Yamaguchi or a Tonya Harding.

71
00:03:00,663 --> 00:03:01,747
Both have their merits,

72
00:03:01,864 --> 00:03:03,265
but only one has a gold medal.

73
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,533
Girl: Have you
seen her legs?

74
00:03:04,534 --> 00:03:05,854
Second girl:
She's such a klutz.

75
00:03:05,855 --> 00:03:07,703
Did you see her fall?
It's a sad fact.

76
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,671
Katelin:
They were all Tonyas.

77
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,073
It was a tiny
over-rotation,

78
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,008
not a bad perm on school picture day.

79
00:03:13,076 --> 00:03:14,116
Don't worry about a thing.

80
00:03:14,143 --> 00:03:15,727
I don't think anyone even noticed.

81
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:17,713
And besides, the rest of
your routine was ice.

82
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,932
The judges love you.

83
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:23,151
Katelin: Liars.
All of them.

84
00:03:23,252 --> 00:03:24,386
But what can you do?

85
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:27,723
We all need comforting at a time like this.

86
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,724
I was terrible!

87
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,360
I know, I know.
What was I thinking?

88
00:03:31,362 --> 00:03:32,594
Where's my scrunchy?

89
00:03:32,662 --> 00:03:33,862
Katelin...
honey...

90
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,770
with your technical
score and choreography...

91
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:38,233
they couldn't deduct a single point.

92
00:03:38,235 --> 00:03:41,036
[Applause]

93
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,841
Katelin:
They deducted 5 points.

94
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:49,378
So maybe I'm not the best
skater in the world yet.

95
00:03:49,445 --> 00:03:51,525
But with the right coaching
and the right scrunchy,

96
00:03:51,526 --> 00:03:52,581
one day, I'm going to be.

97
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,083
Let's break training.
Who wants a

98
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,985
frozen yogurt?!
Frozen yogurt?!

99
00:03:57,053 --> 00:03:59,054
[Russian accent] Excuse me, I'm...

100
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:01,189
Natasha Goberman!
Natasha Goberman!

101
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,192
Ah. You know my work.

102
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:08,630
There isn't a skater or a coach
worth her salchow who doesn't.

103
00:04:08,698 --> 00:04:11,266
You flatter me.

104
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,702
Do you mind if I have a word with the girl?

105
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,954
No.
Go right ahead.

106
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:17,505
You want to talk to me?

107
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:18,957
No.

108
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:21,476
I want to make you a star.

109
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,345
Oh!

110
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:33,789
Here you go.

111
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,758
Sputnik, you were a firecracker on the ice.

112
00:04:36,826 --> 00:04:39,761
Your jumps were Miles
above any girl out there.

113
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:41,663
Really? I'm that good?

114
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,765
Oh, no. Your artistry
is twitchy.

115
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:45,133
Your technique needs training,

116
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,502
and a little less with the jazz hands.

117
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,171
Oh.
But...

118
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,657
You could be that good.

119
00:04:53,142 --> 00:04:56,445
Let me ask you question.
Why do you skate?

120
00:04:56,512 --> 00:04:58,680
Well, that's easy.
Because of the glitter.

121
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,781
Oh.

122
00:04:59,783 --> 00:05:03,518
And because when my
blades touch that ice...

123
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:05,354
Wow.

124
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:07,923
[Sighs] Out there, I know
what I'm supposed to do

125
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,791
and how I'm supposed to act,

126
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:12,177
and no one can judge me.

127
00:05:12,261 --> 00:05:15,197
Well, except for the judges, of course.

128
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:17,599
Sometimes I feel like if I
don't skate, I'll scream.

129
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:22,371
And that, my little sputnik,
is why I'm here.

130
00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:24,973
It would be my honor to train you.

131
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,542
Katelin:
Am I dreaming this?

132
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,211
This is no dream.

133
00:05:29,213 --> 00:05:31,013
It's nightmare.

134
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,816
But those who survive it
are among the best in the world.

135
00:05:34,818 --> 00:05:37,152
I wanna be the best in the world.

136
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,205
Then you must train with me
at Buckston academy.

137
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:43,408
I'm the head coach
of the figure skating club.

138
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:47,062
And with the right coaching,
by yours truly,

139
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,897
you could be champion.

140
00:05:51,034 --> 00:05:53,234
Katelin: Champion. Hmm.

141
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,569
Boarding school?

142
00:05:54,637 --> 00:05:56,471
Yes, mom.
I have to go.

143
00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:57,399
No, you don't.

144
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,440
There's nothing wrong with

145
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,641
the high school you're at now.

146
00:05:59,656 --> 00:06:00,936
You're getting a fine education.

147
00:06:01,003 --> 00:06:02,403
Mom, this isn't about my education.

148
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:03,244
It's about my future.

149
00:06:03,245 --> 00:06:04,346
It's too expensive.

150
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,548
We could use my college money.

151
00:06:06,582 --> 00:06:07,883
Guess again, katelin.

152
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,918
[Pouts] Daddy, help.

153
00:06:09,986 --> 00:06:11,987
We're tapped out, kid.
The well is dry.

154
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,756
But I have to train
with her. She's Russian.

155
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,692
Natasha Goberman is the
toughest coach on ice.

156
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,161
You wouldn't last a day with her.

157
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:20,175
Mother!

158
00:06:20,176 --> 00:06:21,496
Now the only thing you have to do

159
00:06:21,497 --> 00:06:23,577
is go upstairs and bring
me down your dirty whites.

160
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:25,332
Could you hand me the remote before you go?

161
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:29,087
Katelin: Uhh! Do you believe they
actually let these two reproduce?

162
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:33,125
Hey, Brad. How goes?

163
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,876
Do you ever knock?

164
00:06:34,944 --> 00:06:37,245
Geometry homework.
Yeech!

165
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:40,615
Wrong again, Einstein.
They're hockey positions.

166
00:06:40,683 --> 00:06:44,619
See, hockey is just geometry on ice.

167
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:46,588
Whatev! I have
a serious problem.

168
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,373
[Sighs] What do you want now?

169
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:51,326
Your rare hockey puck collection.

170
00:06:52,428 --> 00:06:53,295
Get out!

171
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:55,080
Bradley, please?

172
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,099
I need the money for tuition...

173
00:06:57,233 --> 00:06:59,901
And you'd be the very first
person I thanked on the podium.

174
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:01,937
Hmm. No!

175
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,539
[Pouts] I can't believe
how selfish you are.

176
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,892
Me?!

177
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:08,976
You want me to give you
my most prized possession

178
00:07:08,977 --> 00:07:10,912
just so you can
flunk out of boarding school?

179
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,314
And win a gold medal.

180
00:07:12,316 --> 00:07:13,949
Katelin...

181
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,151
You're the most spoiled,
self-absorbed,

182
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:19,254
Prima Donna twirl girl I've ever met.

183
00:07:20,623 --> 00:07:22,124
I'm not self-absorbed.

184
00:07:22,126 --> 00:07:23,925
I did that walkathon.
Ha!

185
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,128
You walked a half a block

186
00:07:26,162 --> 00:07:28,497
and only raised $3.00
for "models without mascara."

187
00:07:28,564 --> 00:07:31,340
Ok! Ok! So the walkathon
wasn't my finest hour,

188
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:33,301
but you don't have to be
such a weenie about it.

189
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,270
[Sighs] I have to get to hockey practice.

190
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,339
Oh, big deal.
Hockey, hockey, hockey.

191
00:07:37,473 --> 00:07:38,840
Get out!

192
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,842
[Pouts] Not until I get my gold medal.

193
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,230
And there better not be one
puck missing when I get back,

194
00:07:43,231 --> 00:07:45,151
or there won't be
a safe place for you to hide.

195
00:07:46,315 --> 00:07:47,449
Uhh!

196
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:55,557
Miss Goberman, my well is dry.

197
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,865
Do you know what it's like
to be so close to your dream

198
00:07:57,866 --> 00:08:00,226
and then have it ripped out
from under you just like that?

199
00:08:00,227 --> 00:08:01,997
No...

200
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,784
But I do know what it's like to be shut out

201
00:08:03,785 --> 00:08:06,868
of the first 2 world championships

202
00:08:06,936 --> 00:08:08,470
and see your future slipping away

203
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:12,374
quicker than Pierogis at
Vladimir putin dinner party.

204
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:13,808
Huh?

205
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:17,028
Listen, sputnik,

206
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,481
I need champion again.

207
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:20,648
I need you.

208
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:24,536
Mmm!

209
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,054
I have idea.

210
00:08:26,122 --> 00:08:28,056
Wait here.
I be right back.

211
00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:35,697
Have you lost your mind?

212
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,550
No... And I hate
second opinions.

213
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:41,069
Look, I've got one scholarship
position to fill this year,

214
00:08:41,137 --> 00:08:42,704
and it ain't gonna be with her.

215
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:43,855
She's spunky.

216
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,590
She's too tiny to play hockey.

217
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,242
Ah, but that's her advantage.

218
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,244
She can get in and out of places

219
00:08:49,312 --> 00:08:51,379
your girls couldn't even dream of.

220
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:52,781
But those legs!

221
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:55,567
You are looking at the only
skater under 16 years of age

222
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:58,720
who has ever done a triple
Axel in competition.

223
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,772
Really?
Would I lie?

224
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:02,157
To get what you want?

225
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:05,327
Would I lie to you, morty?

226
00:09:05,394 --> 00:09:08,613
Natasha, my team is bad enough as it is.

227
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:11,899
This recruitment's my one chance to
get some fresh blood in the lineup.

228
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:13,535
I'd owe you.

229
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,537
What you say?

230
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:16,788
[Chuckles] Well...

231
00:09:16,905 --> 00:09:18,590
The way I see it, there are only 3 things

232
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:21,543
that are gonna get your
figure skater on my hockey team.

233
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:22,610
Yes?

234
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:26,014
You, me, and a restaurant by the sea.

235
00:09:26,115 --> 00:09:29,217
Pick me up at 8:00.

236
00:09:29,352 --> 00:09:32,020
A scholarship?
Oh, I can't believe it.

237
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:35,557
Welcome to Buckston academy.

238
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,559
You start hockey training in a week.

239
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,961
Hockey?!

240
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:41,613
Don't you mean figure skating?

241
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,064
No.

242
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,767
This school doesn't offer
scholarship for figure skating.

243
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:48,970
No high school or college
in the country does.

244
00:09:49,038 --> 00:09:51,640
How unfair is that, America?

245
00:09:51,642 --> 00:09:53,808
But I can't play hockey.

246
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:55,810
I'm only getting
a c-minus in geometry.

247
00:09:55,878 --> 00:09:57,779
What does that have to do with hockey?

248
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,548
You have to ask my brother,
although I don't recommend it.

249
00:10:00,616 --> 00:10:02,884
Plus, those uniforms are hideous.

250
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:03,952
I can't do it.

251
00:10:03,954 --> 00:10:05,987
Katelin, listen to me.

252
00:10:06,055 --> 00:10:11,760
Everyone knows you cannot pull
fish out of pond without labor.

253
00:10:11,827 --> 00:10:13,895
Do you want to train with me?

254
00:10:13,996 --> 00:10:15,063
Yes.

255
00:10:15,164 --> 00:10:16,631
Do you want to be the best?

256
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,665
Yes!

257
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,668
Do you want you face on cereal box?

258
00:10:19,768 --> 00:10:21,269
More than anything!

259
00:10:21,337 --> 00:10:23,238
Then there is no alternative.

260
00:10:23,306 --> 00:10:24,673
You will play hockey.

261
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,475
Here is your schedule.

262
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,327
When will I find time to train?

263
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:31,546
In the blocks I marked in red.

264
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,251
Now... Go get your fish.

265
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:40,188
[Dog barks]

266
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:43,708
Wow.
Ha ha!

267
00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:44,993
What's going on?

268
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,941
I though we couldn't play
hockey in the house?

269
00:10:46,942 --> 00:10:48,982
Didn't you hear? Katelin
got a hockey scholarship.

270
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:49,964
What?!

271
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:51,599
She doesn't even know how to play!

272
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,220
Come on, Bradley.
How hard can it be?

273
00:10:53,224 --> 00:10:54,584
I just scored 3 points off of dad.

274
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:56,338
You mean she...

275
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,139
But I'm the one...

276
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,274
Are you kidding me?!

277
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:00,809
It's no joke.

278
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,678
Oh, that's 4.

279
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,197
See? Ha!

280
00:11:06,282 --> 00:11:08,383
Wow. This
is so easy.

281
00:11:08,451 --> 00:11:10,452
[Laughs]

282
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,053
[Sighs]

283
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:14,122
Oh, mom, you're not still sad, are you?

284
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,524
I'm not sad.
I'm excited.

285
00:11:16,526 --> 00:11:20,195
I think this boarding school's
gonna be a great thing for you.

286
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,729
My little girl's growing up.

287
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,132
Yes, she is.

288
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,900
Ok, kids.
In the trunk.

289
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:28,736
What about leaving the plushies at home?

290
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,573
Mom, I can't go to school
without my old friends.

291
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,541
This is a chance for you
to meet new friends,

292
00:11:33,575 --> 00:11:34,909
real ones this time.

293
00:11:36,746 --> 00:11:39,431
Mom, I'm not going to Buckston
academy to make friends.

294
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:41,149
I'm going there to skate.

295
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,522
[Sighs]

296
00:11:42,523 --> 00:11:45,403
You're gonna learn that there's a lot
more to life than figure skating.

297
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:47,756
Not for me.

298
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:49,257
There could be.

299
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:51,325
No.

300
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:58,400
Katelin: I thought
balance was balance,

301
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,269
but I can barely stand
on these hockey skates.

302
00:12:01,337 --> 00:12:03,421
Life is a game, eagles!

303
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:05,240
Hockey is not.

304
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,026
And when you stepped onto this ice today...

305
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,078
Excuse me.
I'm totally lost.

306
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,266
Could someone please tell me

307
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:12,947
where the girls hockey team is practicing.

308
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:14,883
We <i>are the girls hockey team.</i>

309
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,887
Oh. Right on.

310
00:12:18,954 --> 00:12:21,439
Kingsford, you're late!

311
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:26,060
Where was I?

312
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:28,296
Life is a game, ladies.

313
00:12:28,364 --> 00:12:29,798
Hockey is not.

314
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:31,199
Is he for real?

315
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:32,834
Shh!

316
00:12:32,902 --> 00:12:35,837
...everything that you believe
to be truth is no longer true.

317
00:12:35,905 --> 00:12:37,105
I can do this.

318
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,741
If I wanna be the best, I have to do this.

319
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:41,810
They're just girls, just like me,

320
00:12:41,877 --> 00:12:43,778
except bigger and meaner

321
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,481
with unconditioned hair.

322
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:48,633
I can do this.
I can do this.

323
00:12:48,717 --> 00:12:50,084
We are a unit on this ice.

324
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,619
We all operate together.

325
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,721
And when you put those jerseys on,

326
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:57,458
you made a commitment
to give your lives to me.

327
00:12:57,493 --> 00:12:58,593
Now...
coach.

328
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:01,462
What? What? What, Spencer?
I'm on a roll here.

329
00:13:01,497 --> 00:13:02,730
What's up with number 36?

330
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:05,650
What's going on?

331
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:07,401
Oh. She's, um...

332
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:11,105
She's our secret weapon.

333
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,677
But she can barely keep her helmet up.

334
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,359
It's all part of the strategy.

335
00:13:14,476 --> 00:13:16,945
All part of the strategy, Spencer.

336
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:18,847
Now may I continue?

337
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:20,365
Proceed.

338
00:13:20,482 --> 00:13:23,818
That commitment began the moment
you stepped on this ice today,

339
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:28,022
and it won't stop until
you give me your last breath

340
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,674
or a championship ring.

341
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,528
Yeah. Well, why don't
we just make a promise

342
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:35,747
to do out best out there,
all right, ladies?

343
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:37,665
Didn't he say this last year?

344
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,000
Sorry.

345
00:13:39,002 --> 00:13:41,202
These shoulder pads are
so not from our generation.

346
00:13:41,204 --> 00:13:42,187
Here, katelin.

347
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,704
Why don't you try this on for size?

348
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,541
Uhh! Ok.

349
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:52,380
Oh, wow. I love the fit,
but do you have it in orange?

350
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:53,848
Yeah, that's on the top of my list.

351
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:55,550
All right, ladies.
Let's practice.

352
00:13:55,618 --> 00:13:57,085
[Blows whistle]

353
00:13:57,152 --> 00:13:59,187
Move, girls!
Move! Let's go!

354
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,722
Let's go, 36!
Move! Move! Move!

355
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,197
Coach: Come on, ladies!
Pick it up!

356
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:07,328
Spencer: What are you doing?
Let's go! Hustle!

357
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,333
[Pouts]

358
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:14,435
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

get her up.

Kid's got potential.

367

She's bootsy.

368
00:14:39,728 --> 00:14:41,696
I know. She's great.

369
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:44,082
Bootsy means terrible.

370
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:46,935
I know that.

00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:48,882

Let's move it! Move it!

36, you're a disaster out there!

374
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:54,776
You're not supposed to hit the cones.

375
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:59,581
You avoid the cones!

376
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,849
Yeah. They're just
in their way.

377
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:04,102
Ignore the cones.

Excuse me, but I am not a number.

I have a name, and it's katelin.

Oh, really? Well, I have
another one for you:

398
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:46,460
You did? But what about
hockey practice every day?

399
00:15:46,495 --> 00:15:47,845
How are you gonna do 'em both?

400
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,297
I'm not playing anymore.

401
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,665
But you love hockey.

402
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:52,233
Yeah, I know, but...

403
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:54,068
What's the point?

404
00:15:56,905 --> 00:15:58,873
Girl: Feels a little better.

405
00:15:58,974 --> 00:16:02,844

more rotation out of it?

[Slams clipboard on ground]

That could have gone better,

416

but I'm sure that's no indication

417
00:16:41,817 --> 00:16:43,618
of how the season will turn out,

418
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:46,154
right, eagles?

419
00:16:46,221 --> 00:16:47,205
Right, eagles?

All: Right.

00:16:49,906 --> 00:16:52,026
I thought you told me you
were training this summer?

423
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,213
Yeah, you'd never know by your skating.

Ronnie, don't even get me started.

428

As captain, you gotta keep
these girls in line out there.

429
00:17:09,311 --> 00:17:10,578
They look to you as an example.

430
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,930
Especially the freshmen.

431

How you feeling, kid?
A little tired?

If my legs could talk, they'd scream.

433
00:17:18,153 --> 00:17:20,655
You'll get better. You
just need a little rest.

she'd have bed sores.

schedules on the way out,

442
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:38,372
I don't know about that.

443
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,809
If I wanna be the best, I have to do this.

445
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,713
That's right, I'm quitting.

446
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:48,149
I don't think so, kid.

You're on the team until I say you're not.

448
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:52,887
You can't be serious.

449
00:17:53,021 --> 00:17:54,188
Oh, I am serious.

450
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:56,369
I broke a lot of rules
to get you that scholarship,

451
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,926
and if you quit now, people
will start asking questions.

452
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,195
And if people ask questions,
people get answers.

453
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:03,030
And if people get the right answers,

454
00:18:03,098 --> 00:18:05,900
I could be in a lot of trouble, you follow?

455
00:18:05,902 --> 00:18:08,603
You lost me at "oh,
I don't think so, kid."

456
00:18:08,605 --> 00:18:12,039
Ok, let me make this perfectly clear.

457
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:14,475
You keep coming to practice,

458

I keep my job.

459
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:19,747
So I have no say in this matter at all?

00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:21,615
None.

461
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,452
But you play your cards right,

462
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,120
you won't have to play a single game.

463
00:18:26,155 --> 00:18:28,756
You'd really bench me?

464
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,324
Oh, that's the nicest thing

465
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:32,426
anyone's done for me
since I've gotten here.

466
00:18:32,494 --> 00:18:33,894
Yeah, yeah.
I'm an angel of mercy.

467
00:18:33,895 --> 00:18:35,663
Go change, will ya?
Oh, hey.

468
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:36,931
And I would keep my mouth shut

469
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:38,733
about the figure skating
club if I were you.

470
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:40,134
Why?

471
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:41,769
Because you don't wanna give these girls

472
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,838
any other reason to skin you alive.

473
00:18:43,972 --> 00:18:46,574
I've always hated figure skaters.

474
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,342
I've got no idea why.

475
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,611
Maybe it's the leotards, I think,

476
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:53,214
or the glitter.

477
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:55,683
I love the glitter.
Ha ha!

478
00:18:57,686 --> 00:18:58,686
Yeah.

479

Well, you just do what I say,

480
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:01,639
and we'll both get through the season

481
00:19:01,756 --> 00:19:03,090
with our feathers intact.

482
00:19:03,158 --> 00:19:04,659
Feathers?

483

00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,214
Funny.

491
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:29,183
I saw you at practice today. You were...

492
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,985
Yeah, I'd rather not talk about that.

493
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:33,454
You were awesome!

494
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,223
Yeah, well, you'll get better.

495
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,210
Honestly, my plan is just to stay alive.

496
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:41,028
No worries, it's not so rough.

497
00:19:41,163 --> 00:19:43,264
Except for, like, the
checking, and the sticking,

498
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:45,816
and, oh, I should apologize
in advance for my snoring.

499
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:47,534
You snore.

500
00:19:47,569 --> 00:19:49,570
It's actually really more
of, like, a whistle.

501

Where did you get that?

502
00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:53,240

It's hysterical.

It is?

Those twirl girls?

509
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:05,019
They should not be allowed
to call that skating.

510
00:20:05,087 --> 00:20:06,287
I don't know, I mean,

511
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,189
sure looks like a lot of hard work to me.

512
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,240
Oh, please.

513
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:10,658
The skate club here is, like,

514
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:12,660
the biggest joke on campus.

515
00:20:12,761 --> 00:20:14,562
I mean, you should see some of those

516
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,264
puny, plushy-collecting
freaks.

517
00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:17,665
Ha ha ha.

518
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:22,570
So, where do we hang our new dart board?

I'm exhausted.

523
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:33,447
Rough practice
today. Really rough.

524
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:35,349
But I love it.
The rougher the better.

525
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:36,450
Yeah, whatever.

526
00:20:36,518 --> 00:20:37,678

527
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,955
Yeah. You sure
bruise easily.

528
00:20:41,023 --> 00:20:42,123
Thanks.

529

My lucky dance.

531
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:46,460
Huh?

532
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:48,029
You wanna win a game this season,

533
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:49,030
don't you?

534
00:20:49,097 --> 00:20:50,564
Sure, I guess.

535
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:52,633
Then leave me to my business.

536
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,035
So, Hollywood...

We are so doomed.

00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,207

00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:39,560
That's delinquent behavior, princess Ronnie!

723
00:29:39,627 --> 00:29:42,863
Maybe you'd like to think about it
on the bench for the entire season!

724
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:45,799
Would that
make you happy?! Huh?

725
00:29:45,934 --> 00:29:47,534
I knew you were gonna be trouble

726
00:29:47,602 --> 00:29:48,986
from the moment I saw you.

727
00:29:49,137 --> 00:29:50,471
Hey! She...

728
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,778
but I thought you were gonna
quit after the first week,

729
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:53,739
so I didn't say nothing.

730
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,142
But I...
spare me, 36.

731
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,010
[Scoffs] Hello?

732
00:29:57,012 --> 00:29:59,680
She jumped me. Oh!

733
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:03,267
You got off easy.

734
00:30:03,351 --> 00:30:06,136
What?!
She tackled me.

735
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,891
Compared to what she should've done to you,

736
00:30:07,892 --> 00:30:08,789
you got off easy.

737
00:30:08,857 --> 00:30:10,474
I wasn't even supposed to play.

738
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:11,992
You weren't?

739
00:30:11,994 --> 00:30:14,995
No. Uh, I... I mean,
I'm a freshman

740
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:17,831
and, uh, I didn't think I'd
get that much ice time.

741
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,366
You didn't?

742
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:21,969
[Groans] Why is everyone so mad at me?

743
00:30:22,036 --> 00:30:24,371
Because you were supposed to block for her.

744
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:26,540
You were her guard and you let her down...

745
00:30:26,608 --> 00:30:27,941
Literally.

746
00:30:32,113 --> 00:30:33,747
Let me see the bump.

747
00:30:35,383 --> 00:30:36,383
I'll go get a mop.

748
00:30:36,451 --> 00:30:38,719
No! I'll get it.

749
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:41,121
You wait here. Heh!

750
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,456
Just hurry.

751
00:30:48,196 --> 00:30:49,863
[Gasps] Aha!

752
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,999
Don't say it.
I knew it!

753
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:53,000
I said don't say it.

754
00:30:53,067 --> 00:30:54,568
You're a twirl girl?
Shh!

755
00:30:54,636 --> 00:30:55,636
Will you be quiet?

756
00:30:55,703 --> 00:30:57,538
This is not a soundproof booth, you know.

757
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:58,705
This is off the hook.

758
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,624
I cannot wait to tell...

759
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:03,393
no. I can't tell
anyone.

760
00:31:03,545 --> 00:31:04,394
Mm-mmm.

761
00:31:04,546 --> 00:31:06,026
Do you know what they would do to you

762
00:31:06,027 --> 00:31:07,187
if they found out about this?

763
00:31:07,188 --> 00:31:08,228
Yes. They'd skin me alive.

764
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,017
Ooh, if you were lucky.

765
00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:13,520
Come on, let's get out of here.

766
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:19,142
It's all so bootsy.

767
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,444
I know.

768
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:22,429
Why didn't you tell me?

769
00:31:22,497 --> 00:31:25,666
After what you did to my kristi
yamaguchi poster, how could I?

770
00:31:25,733 --> 00:31:27,100
Oh, that.

771
00:31:27,168 --> 00:31:30,571
That's just healthy rivalry
between the sports.

772
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,039
You threw darts at her.

773
00:31:32,106 --> 00:31:34,174
So it's not so healthy. Mmm.

774
00:31:34,242 --> 00:31:37,778
But it... it's just because
I've never met one before.

775
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:40,180
Now you have.

776
00:31:40,248 --> 00:31:41,982
Why put yourself through all that

777
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,850
just for figure skating?

778
00:31:43,918 --> 00:31:46,920
Because, unlike my performance
on the hockey rink,

779
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:50,090
I'm a great figure skater,
and I want to be the best.

780
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:53,093
When I'm on the ice, and I nail a routine

781
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:54,561
and I mean really nail it,

782
00:31:54,629 --> 00:31:57,731
and my heart is racing, and the
audience jumps to their feet,

783
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:59,066
it's like...

784
00:31:59,133 --> 00:32:01,253
like that hat trick I scored
back in pee-wee hockey.

785
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:03,537
Yeah. I guess.

786
00:32:06,207 --> 00:32:08,058
Look at Destructo go!

787
00:32:08,142 --> 00:32:10,711
Yeah. Let's see katelin
build one of these.

788
00:32:10,778 --> 00:32:12,079
What?

789
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,081
That's why you quit hockey, right?

790
00:32:14,148 --> 00:32:15,349
The competition?

791
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:18,285
No, I told you, I quit
because it was pointless.

792
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,420
[Dog barking]

793
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,756
What do you know?

794
00:32:22,824 --> 00:32:23,924
Watch out.

795

[Whimpers]

796
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,321
Uh-oh, it's coming back.

797
00:32:37,472 --> 00:32:38,905
Run, Hooner, run!

798
00:32:38,973 --> 00:32:40,841
Bradley, not responding!

799
00:32:40,843 --> 00:32:42,843
It's shooting.

800
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:45,445
Aaah!
Aaah!

801
00:32:47,915 --> 00:32:50,033
[Squeaking]

802
00:32:51,786 --> 00:32:53,420
Back to the drawing board.

803
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:02,262
There.
That's what I want.

804
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:03,997
Focus. Still.

805
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:06,199
Champion.

806
00:33:06,267 --> 00:33:07,534
Champion?

807
00:33:07,602 --> 00:33:10,003
Not on my watch.

808
00:33:27,355 --> 00:33:28,488
Katelin!

809
00:33:34,295 --> 00:33:35,896
Congratulations.

810
00:33:35,898 --> 00:33:37,664
You made the front page.

811
00:33:42,203 --> 00:33:44,003
Just say what you want
and get it over with,

812
00:33:44,004 --> 00:33:45,844
'cause I'm too tired
to fight everyone today.

813
00:33:45,845 --> 00:33:47,090
Oh, stop it.

814
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:48,842
I'm trying to apologize.

815
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,343
I know I've been hard on you,

816
00:33:50,411 --> 00:33:53,913
but, come on, you're my only
serious competition here.

817
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,249
Sorry, Heather.

818
00:33:56,317 --> 00:33:59,019
I have to be a little jealous, right?

819
00:33:59,087 --> 00:34:01,204
Of course you do.

820
00:34:01,322 --> 00:34:02,322
And to make it up to you,

821
00:34:02,323 --> 00:34:04,323
I'd like to invite you
to a party tomorrow night.

822
00:34:04,324 --> 00:34:05,826
A party?
Yeah.

823
00:34:05,926 --> 00:34:07,728
Oh, I can't.

824
00:34:07,762 --> 00:34:09,329
I have
a 9:00 workout.

825
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:10,731
At night?

826
00:34:10,865 --> 00:34:12,785
Yeah. Natasha's working
with my crazy schedule.

827
00:34:12,786 --> 00:34:15,335
How sweet of her.

828
00:34:15,403 --> 00:34:18,572
Well, it's too bad you're not
going to make the party.

829
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,023
The whole skate club will be there,

830
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:23,276
except for you, of course.

831
00:34:24,345 --> 00:34:26,430
Well, I guess I could go
for a little while.

832
00:34:28,249 --> 00:34:30,584
[Laughter]

833
00:34:32,019 --> 00:34:34,154
Oh. You can't
be serious.

834
00:34:34,222 --> 00:34:36,757
Yeah. Totally serious.

835
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,692
I'll catch up with you guys later.

836
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,227
Hurry up.

837
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,064
Hey, katelin.

838
00:35:02,817 --> 00:35:03,833
What are you doing here?

839
00:35:03,951 --> 00:35:05,302
I'm reading <i>the great gatsby.</i>

840
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:06,720
What does it look like I'm doing?

841
00:35:06,821 --> 00:35:08,255
I'm just surprised.

842
00:35:08,322 --> 00:35:10,522
It's not like you're the
team's most dedicated player.

843
00:35:10,523 --> 00:35:12,659
It's not dedication,
it's self-preservation.

844
00:35:12,727 --> 00:35:15,328
Don't you have anything better
to do than to harass me?

845
00:35:15,396 --> 00:35:16,596
No.

846
00:35:16,664 --> 00:35:19,266
Ok, what's it gonna take
to get you off my ice,

847
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:20,634
a restraining order?

848
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:21,768
No.

849
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,756
I got a better idea.

850
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,211
Ok, secret weapon,
you get that puck past me

851
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:34,014
and I promise I'll never say
another word about you again.

852

never say another word.

00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,199
Wow. That was...

858
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,568
you promised.
