00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:12,700
Subrip by DanDee

2
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:55,991
I made the last of the bacon.
Go ahead, eat.

3
00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:57,360
All right.

4
00:00:58,994 --> 00:01:00,262
Seems odd.

5
00:01:00,296 --> 00:01:03,600
First day of work,
me taking you.

6
00:01:03,632 --> 00:01:05,034
Like the first day of school,

7
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:06,402
only so different
than I remember.

8
00:01:06,436 --> 00:01:08,238
Come on, Ma, don't.

9
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:10,406
What?

10
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,808
I just wish things
were different, that's all.

11
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:14,411
I told you this is
what I wanted to do.

12
00:01:14,444 --> 00:01:15,811
Yeah.

13
00:01:15,844 --> 00:01:17,346
You know, I'm lucky to get on
at the warehouse.

14
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:20,149
It's good money.
Good job.

15
00:01:20,183 --> 00:01:21,318
Maybe I should
pick up more shifts.

16
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,751
What are you talking about?

17
00:01:22,784 --> 00:01:25,421
You're already working
too many hours as it is.

18
00:01:25,454 --> 00:01:27,423
What about Colleen and Bernard?
They need you.

19
00:01:27,456 --> 00:01:29,125
When did you get so smart?

20
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,594
Come on, Ma, we gotta go.

21
00:01:59,923 --> 00:02:01,591
I hate this place.

22
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:02,625
Ma.

23
00:02:04,193 --> 00:02:06,662
Well, I appreciate
your helping us out though.

24
00:02:06,695 --> 00:02:09,566
I know.
You told me 100 times.

25
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,700
I love you.

26
00:02:12,168 --> 00:02:13,871
I love you, too.

27
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:24,613
Hey, what's up?

28
00:02:24,614 --> 00:02:25,581
No worries, G.

29
00:02:25,615 --> 00:02:28,084
All right, man.
You're gonna love this job.

30
00:02:28,116 --> 00:02:29,485
Get up there.

31
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:31,354
Mr. Green is on the way.

32
00:02:31,387 --> 00:02:32,923
Your dinner will be
in the microwave.

33
00:02:32,955 --> 00:02:35,391
Just reheat it
for four minutes on medium.

34
00:02:35,425 --> 00:02:37,894
I'm gonna be at my sister's.

35
00:02:37,926 --> 00:02:39,562
Girls' night out.

36
00:02:51,206 --> 00:02:52,641
<i>I feel like such a failure.</i>

37
00:02:52,642 --> 00:02:54,076
<i>Well, you're not.</i>

38
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,912
<i>You are doing
the very best you can.</i>

39
00:02:55,944 --> 00:02:57,413
Well, he wanted to go
to culinary school

40
00:02:57,447 --> 00:02:58,782
and I stuck him
in that factory.

41
00:02:58,814 --> 00:03:01,151
Well, first of all,
he's not stuck.

42
00:03:01,183 --> 00:03:03,186
And B, it is not forever.

43
00:03:03,218 --> 00:03:05,955
I'm just afraid he's gonna turn to
stone in that place.

44
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:07,890
Oh, come on, turn your frown
upside down.

45
00:03:07,924 --> 00:03:09,426
Let's go wait tables.

46
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:11,194
I don't know how
to make this palpably clear.

47
00:03:11,227 --> 00:03:13,063
You know, I got a team of 10 Chinese
delegates coming here

48
00:03:13,096 --> 00:03:15,932
to inspect 20 fucking
layers going out to Beijing

49
00:03:15,965 --> 00:03:18,168
at $750,000 a pop,

50
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,735
and I'm missing two of them.

51
00:03:20,436 --> 00:03:22,038
I want accountability.

52
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,406
I'll take care of it for you.

53
00:03:23,438 --> 00:03:25,574
Hey, boss, this is Dave Willis.

54
00:03:25,608 --> 00:03:27,243
You know, I told you about him.

55
00:03:29,945 --> 00:03:32,115
All right, walk with me.

56
00:03:32,147 --> 00:03:34,049
Vardi says you do good work.

57
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:35,818
- Yes, sir.
- Anybody ask you around here,

58
00:03:35,852 --> 00:03:37,721
You make apprentice pay,
all right?

59
00:03:37,753 --> 00:03:39,688
I'm on good terms
with the union.

60
00:03:39,722 --> 00:03:42,092
I like the union.
They like me.

61
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,560
Let's not fuck it up.

62
00:03:43,592 --> 00:03:46,096
Okay, Louis,
two roast beef, one end cut.

63
00:03:46,128 --> 00:03:48,063
Louis, you're killing me,
I need the shrimp cocktail,

64
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:50,500
onion soup, green salad
with dressing on the side.

65
00:03:50,532 --> 00:03:52,268
Shrimp oregatano,
chicken rollatini,

66
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:53,435
- mushrooms on the side.
- Hey, wait a second.

67
00:03:53,468 --> 00:03:54,704
I'm still waiting on my order.

68
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:55,705
Wait some more.
Really.

69
00:03:55,706 --> 00:03:56,673
Really?

70
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:58,574
Don't keep me waiting, Louis.

71
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:04,448
Oh, and there's
no more end cuts.

72
00:04:06,883 --> 00:04:08,001
Eh, what's this?

73
00:04:08,002 --> 00:04:09,118
Roast beef.

74
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:10,352
I ordered an end cut.

75
00:04:10,353 --> 00:04:11,553
That's all they had left.

76
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:12,921
Well, why didn't you come back?

77
00:04:12,954 --> 00:04:14,390
Well, before you said
you were in a rush,

78
00:04:14,423 --> 00:04:15,824
and that's what they gave me.

79
00:04:15,858 --> 00:04:18,394
Look, honey, I'm used
to getting what I order.

80
00:04:18,427 --> 00:04:19,728
And when I order an end cut,

81
00:04:19,762 --> 00:04:21,230
I either get the end cut,

82
00:04:21,264 --> 00:04:23,600
or I'm given the opportunity
to get something else,

83
00:04:23,632 --> 00:04:26,068
because I don't like other people
making up my mind for me.

84
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:28,971
Come on, Ed.
She's just a waitress.

85
00:04:31,173 --> 00:04:32,608
Not bad, huh?

86
00:04:32,641 --> 00:04:34,911
Yeah, nice leather.

87
00:04:34,944 --> 00:04:37,247
Yeah, you know, you'll
be looking fresh, too,

88
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:39,181
if you just pay
attention to what I gotta say,

89
00:04:39,214 --> 00:04:41,375
keep your mouth shut,
and let me handle everything, huh?

90
00:04:41,384 --> 00:04:44,454
Yeah, I don't wanna be stuck here
for the next 30 years.

91
00:04:44,487 --> 00:04:46,590
Yeah, that's fucking right.
Let's go.

92
00:04:50,927 --> 00:04:52,495
Hey, Ma.

93
00:04:52,528 --> 00:04:54,463
Hey, what did you buy now?

94
00:04:54,497 --> 00:04:55,865
Look, we got...
We gotta cut back.

95
00:04:55,898 --> 00:04:57,934
I can't keep paying
for all the cell phones.

96
00:04:57,966 --> 00:05:01,036
You can keep yours,
but I'm gonna shut mine off.

97
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:03,939
Oh, hey, Ma, you're not
turning your phone off.

98
00:05:03,973 --> 00:05:06,643
Now that I got a job,
you know, you can keep it.

99
00:05:06,675 --> 00:05:08,110
Well, that's awfully
sweet, honey,

100
00:05:08,144 --> 00:05:10,646
but, look, and I don't
want you cooking tonight.

101
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,281
You should go out
with your friends.

102
00:05:12,314 --> 00:05:14,283
Nah, I gotta go in
at 6:00 tomorrow.

103
00:05:14,317 --> 00:05:15,134
Relax.

104
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,951
Relax?

105
00:05:15,985 --> 00:05:17,888
That's not a word
in my vocabulary.

106
00:05:19,588 --> 00:05:20,723
Ma, it's not your fault.

107
00:05:20,757 --> 00:05:22,257
Pops smoked three packs a day.

108
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,026
I can't even think about him
without filling

109
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,627
his coffin with bills,

110
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:28,064
including the one from the cemetery
and the funeral parlor.

111
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:32,534
Ma, come here.

112
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:33,936
Mmm.

113
00:05:33,937 --> 00:05:35,305
You know, look, I love you.

114
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:37,006
It's gonna be all right.

115
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:38,375
I love you, too.

116
00:05:40,442 --> 00:05:43,012
So, it's no big deal to
let me in then. Come on.

117
00:05:43,045 --> 00:05:46,383
You know, Dave, it's not a game,
you know?

118
00:05:46,415 --> 00:05:47,617
I know.

119
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:49,519
My mother's been
torturing herself.

120
00:05:49,552 --> 00:05:51,054
I gotta do something, man.
I gotta make some...

121
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:53,088
Look, man, you should just
be happy

122
00:05:53,122 --> 00:05:54,790
I got you the job here
in the first place.

123
00:05:54,824 --> 00:05:56,658
I know, and you said
if I did a good job,

124
00:05:56,692 --> 00:05:58,026
you'd talk about
something else.

125
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,528
God, you're busting me.

126
00:05:59,562 --> 00:06:01,097
All right, you know what?

127
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:02,966
Give me a few days
and I'll see what I can do.

128
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:04,501
I am.

129
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:06,002
All right, then
shut the fuck up.

130
00:06:06,035 --> 00:06:07,371
Jesus.

131
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,274
How you doing?

132
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:11,108
Yo, what's up?

133
00:06:14,976 --> 00:06:16,045
Hey.

134
00:06:25,454 --> 00:06:26,822
Right where your father sat.

135
00:06:26,855 --> 00:06:28,992
You don't even have
to check my ID anymore.

136
00:06:29,024 --> 00:06:31,026
Put that away.

137
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,062
I'm the man
in my house now, Dez.

138
00:06:34,096 --> 00:06:36,132
That's the only
way your father would want it.

139
00:06:36,165 --> 00:06:37,434
Yeah.

140
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,004
I miss him.

141
00:06:41,036 --> 00:06:44,640
Nothing's the same.
Not this place, the block...

142
00:06:44,673 --> 00:06:46,242
Nothing.

143
00:06:46,243 --> 00:06:47,810
Yeah, you got that right.

144
00:06:47,843 --> 00:06:49,411
Don't become a mess
like them punks

145
00:06:49,444 --> 00:06:50,947
I gotta deal with every night.

146
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,215
Not me.

147
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:53,483
I have to deal with my mom.

148
00:06:53,516 --> 00:06:54,751
She worries every second,

149
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:56,752
even when I'm doing
the right thing.

150
00:06:56,786 --> 00:06:58,387
She's a tough one.
Always was.

151
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,757
Yeah, she's pissed
I'm working at the metal factory

152
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,425
instead of being in school.

153
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,495
I know.

154
00:07:03,496 --> 00:07:05,496
I gotta make more money.
I gotta be the man.

155
00:07:05,528 --> 00:07:07,230
She's heartbroken
your father's gone.

156
00:07:07,262 --> 00:07:09,097
- I offered to help, but she won't let me.
- Hey, no, no, no.

157
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,666
I'm handling it.

158
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:16,506
She met your father
right here where you're sitting.

159
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:18,774
I know.

160
00:07:18,807 --> 00:07:21,177
I just wish he didn't
sit here forever.

161
00:07:22,245 --> 00:07:23,612
He loved you.

162
00:07:25,514 --> 00:07:26,849
He freaking had your
christening party here,

163
00:07:26,882 --> 00:07:28,383
left you sleeping in the booth.

164
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:31,887
Yeah.

165
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:34,690
Life flies.

166
00:07:35,824 --> 00:07:37,459
Just keep doing the right thing

167
00:07:37,492 --> 00:07:39,228
with your life, okay, kid?

168
00:07:43,165 --> 00:07:44,768
<i>Drink up.
Salud.</i>

169
00:07:55,877 --> 00:07:57,680
Yo.

170
00:07:57,713 --> 00:07:59,182
Time for your job interview.

171
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,185
All right?

172
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:07,691
Maybe I'll start
you out running bath salts.

173
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,529
Remember those crazy
fucking kids over there in the park?

174
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:16,832
Every now and then,
do a little a run.

175
00:08:16,865 --> 00:08:18,567
Little hole in the wall.

176
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:20,469
What a mess made.

177
00:08:21,937 --> 00:08:23,939
You just keepyour mouth shut
to everyone but me.

178
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,141
Are we clear?

179
00:08:29,778 --> 00:08:32,347
So, what's with
our friend, huh,

180
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,884
over there in the bar?

181
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,251
It's no good.

182
00:08:36,284 --> 00:08:37,804
Blabbing all over
the neighborhood now.

183
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,556
He's gonna clean
this place up with what?

184
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:41,191
Drug-free bullshit?

185
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,026
People ain't happy.

186
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:46,195
Yeah, I know,
I know. Me, too.

187
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,700
Maybe you ought to do
something about that.

188
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,404
Yeah.

189
00:08:55,437 --> 00:08:57,639
Yeah, you know, he called the cops
twice last week.

190
00:08:57,673 --> 00:08:58,774
It's not good for business.

191
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:00,509
You know why
you're here, right?

192
00:09:00,543 --> 00:09:01,912
Because of him.

193
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:07,783
We run a business.
We don't beat nobody.

194
00:09:07,817 --> 00:09:10,620
Move everything
at a good price.

195
00:09:10,653 --> 00:09:14,490
I put quality shit in the street
for a lot of years.

196
00:09:14,523 --> 00:09:15,992
You do the volume,

197
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,861
they come back.

198
00:09:27,403 --> 00:09:28,772
Thank you, Luige.

199
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:35,511
Hey, it's so good to see you guys
out as a family again.

200
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:36,778
- How you two doing?
- Good, hungry.

201
00:09:36,812 --> 00:09:37,980
Keep it up.

202
00:09:38,014 --> 00:09:38,798
And you, Ma?

203
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:39,581
We missed you.

204
00:09:39,615 --> 00:09:41,317
But, you know, things haven't
been so easy lately.

205
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,186
Yo, hey, everything's
changing though, right?

206
00:09:43,219 --> 00:09:45,021
I'm over there working
at the steel factory now.

207
00:09:45,053 --> 00:09:46,322
It's going good.
We're getting back on our feet.

208
00:09:46,355 --> 00:09:48,224
Yeah, but that's
only for a little bit,

209
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:49,791
because, you know,
he's going to college, right, Ronnie?

210
00:09:49,825 --> 00:09:50,910
Soon enough, Ma.

211
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:51,995
Well, it's all I wish for.

212
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:53,629
Good advice.
Listen to your mother.

213
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,798
Eat that. It makes
everything all right.

214
00:09:56,831 --> 00:09:58,867
Be careful, it's hot.

215
00:10:03,538 --> 00:10:07,177
Yo, yo, watch the master.

216
00:10:09,378 --> 00:10:10,630
What's up?

217
00:10:10,631 --> 00:10:11,881
What's good, my brother?

218
00:10:11,913 --> 00:10:13,298
Mmm, how you doing?

219
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:14,683
Good, man. And you?

220
00:10:14,716 --> 00:10:16,519
Two packets today
of the ivory wave.

221
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:17,553
Two.

222
00:10:17,554 --> 00:10:18,553
Yes.

223
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:20,539
One, two for you.

224
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,491
All right.

225
00:10:22,524 --> 00:10:24,026
Buckle my shoe.

226
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:27,162
Yo, Robbie, this is Dave.
He's my boy.

227
00:10:27,196 --> 00:10:28,965
He's good.

228
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:30,533
Well, enjoy your day.

229
00:10:30,534 --> 00:10:32,068
Yeah.

230
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,671
All right, yo, so, you sell
the crystal first,

231
00:10:34,703 --> 00:10:38,740
and then the ivory wave and
you start getting paid, huh?

232
00:10:38,774 --> 00:10:43,111
But you're gonna
make a lot of coin. A lot of coin.

233
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:44,980
Better start selling some shit.

234
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:48,851
Oh, man, this is quality.
Nothing finer.

235
00:10:50,219 --> 00:10:51,421
Yo, here we go.

236
00:10:52,587 --> 00:10:53,789
All right.

237
00:11:09,772 --> 00:11:11,107
I'm Blackie.

238
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:18,715
No mistakes.

239
00:11:19,447 --> 00:11:20,716
Yes, sir.

240
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,703
<i> Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

241
00:11:41,604 --> 00:11:43,773
<i> Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

242
00:11:44,606 --> 00:11:46,942
<i> Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

243
00:11:47,743 --> 00:11:50,046
<i> Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

244
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:52,648
<i> Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

245
00:11:52,681 --> 00:11:53,983
<i> Let me hear you say it</i>

246
00:11:54,015 --> 00:11:55,751
<i> Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

247
00:11:55,784 --> 00:11:57,086
<i> Let me hear you say</i>

248
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:59,055
<i> Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

249
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:02,024
<i> Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

250
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:04,927
<i> Your boat</i>

251
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,796
<i> My boat</i>

252
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:09,798
<i> My boat, your boat</i>

253
00:12:09,831 --> 00:12:11,201
<i> Everyone's boat</i>

254
00:12:12,802 --> 00:12:14,403
<i> Everyone's boat</i>

255
00:12:14,436 --> 00:12:17,874
<i> Yeah, you're doing your thing</i>

256
00:12:17,907 --> 00:12:20,942
<i> My thing, my thing</i>

257
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:24,480
<i> Your thing
all gotta thing, yeah</i>

258
00:12:24,513 --> 00:12:27,182
<i> And it's a very good thing </i>

259
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:56,711
What's this?

260
00:12:56,745 --> 00:12:58,114
For whatever you want.

261
00:13:02,618 --> 00:13:03,753
Is this your salary?

262
00:13:03,785 --> 00:13:06,488
It's table money, Ma.
Use it.

263
00:13:06,522 --> 00:13:08,091
Do something, go shopping.

264
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:11,161
Things are gonna
change around here.

265
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:15,365
We're not living
like dogs anymore.

266
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,936
There you go, man.
Try that on.

267
00:13:19,969 --> 00:13:20,987
These look great.

268
00:13:20,988 --> 00:13:22,004
This is so awesome.

269
00:13:22,037 --> 00:13:23,105
- You like that?
- They fit perfectly.

270
00:13:23,138 --> 00:13:25,074
Ma, look what Dave got!

271
00:13:25,106 --> 00:13:26,641
What is all this, Dave?

272
00:13:26,674 --> 00:13:28,777
I worked some overtime.

273
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:30,745
Well, you shouldn't
have done this.

274
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:32,215
Here, turn it on.

275
00:13:32,248 --> 00:13:34,684
No, no, no. You gotta take it back.
We've got bills.

276
00:13:34,716 --> 00:13:35,884
The bills are paid.

277
00:13:35,918 --> 00:13:38,153
Ma, you should be
happy. Smile.

278
00:13:38,187 --> 00:13:40,423
I mean, look at these, Ma,
they're brand new!

279
00:13:40,456 --> 00:13:42,024
Jeez, Ma, can't you
let them enjoy it?

280
00:13:42,057 --> 00:13:43,697
Don't you think we've
been through enough?

281
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:47,263
You know what, then?

282
00:13:47,296 --> 00:13:49,699
Fuck it.
Throw it away.

283
00:13:49,731 --> 00:13:51,567
You know, we'll just stay the fucking
depressed family

284
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,736
for the rest of our life.
That's what you want?

285
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:57,038
Man, looking to buy?

286
00:13:57,072 --> 00:13:58,474
You got the green?

287
00:13:58,506 --> 00:13:59,441
All righty, then.

288
00:13:59,442 --> 00:14:00,375
Don't worry about that.

289
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:05,014
Son of a bitch.

290
00:14:05,047 --> 00:14:08,151
I thought I was rid of these goddamn
fucking drug dealers.

291
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,856
Shit. I'm tired
of this shit.

292
00:14:15,423 --> 00:14:17,692
I'm tired of being
the fucking good guy.

293
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:20,897
<i> We are contained
We bring the pain</i>

294
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:22,197
<i> Fuck with your brain </i>

295
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,532
You kids get
the fuck outta here.

296
00:14:23,565 --> 00:14:25,600
You're ruining
the fucking neighborhood!

297
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,739
That's for your father, Davey!

298
00:14:30,972 --> 00:14:32,474
Fuck!

299
00:14:33,575 --> 00:14:34,710
Dave, you all right?

300
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:36,879
Fuck!

301
00:14:39,214 --> 00:14:41,284
I don't understand.
How could this have happened?

302
00:14:41,317 --> 00:14:43,952
I told you.
Steel girder came out of nowhere.

303
00:14:43,985 --> 00:14:46,355
Look how swollen it is.

304
00:14:46,388 --> 00:14:48,423
Maybe he should
get an X-ray.

305
00:14:53,062 --> 00:14:54,146
Davey?

306
00:14:54,147 --> 00:14:55,230
What?

307
00:14:55,264 --> 00:14:58,668
One little whack in the back
and you're out?

308
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:01,037
Look, that's no good for me.
See, I brought you in.

309
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,339
Well, maybe it's not the great idea
I thought it was.

310
00:15:03,371 --> 00:15:05,173
What the fuck
are you talking about?

311
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:06,975
I want nothing to do
with running this shit.

312
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:09,711
No, we gotta make a drop.

313
00:15:09,745 --> 00:15:11,913
Yeah, my mama keeps
asking about the money.

314
00:15:11,947 --> 00:15:14,482
You know what she's like when she
wants to get to the bottom of things.

315
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:16,418
No, see, I haven't been in your house
since she figured out

316
00:15:16,451 --> 00:15:19,522
I was the one who took the fiver
from her pocketbook.

317
00:15:19,554 --> 00:15:22,024
You came begging
to me, remember?

318
00:15:24,058 --> 00:15:26,361
We're making a fucking drop.

319
00:15:48,283 --> 00:15:50,686
What are you doing here?

320
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:54,290
I wanted to see if he's such a
tough guy without his little stick.

321
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:00,562
No, see, we gotta make peace.

322
00:16:00,596 --> 00:16:03,032
See, this is one
of our best spots.

323
00:16:03,065 --> 00:16:04,300
Yeah, I don't know.

324
00:16:04,332 --> 00:16:05,934
My back still kind of hurts.

325
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:08,337
All right.
Let me handle this.

326
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:18,713
Hey, Dezy,

327
00:16:18,746 --> 00:16:21,483
we just came by
to say you were right.

328
00:16:21,517 --> 00:16:23,519
We shouldn't have been doing
what we were doing.

329
00:16:23,552 --> 00:16:24,586
It was wrong.

330
00:16:25,354 --> 00:16:26,855
I'm sorry about it.

331
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:29,658
You didn't need
to beat on us like you did.

332
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:31,060
You could've talked to us.

333
00:16:31,793 --> 00:16:33,428
Right?

334
00:16:33,461 --> 00:16:35,230
But, hey, it's the past, right?

335
00:16:35,264 --> 00:16:38,201
Ancient history. So why
don't we forget about it?

336
00:16:42,004 --> 00:16:43,306
Have a beer.

337
00:16:44,072 --> 00:16:45,441
Look at that, huh?

338
00:16:46,475 --> 00:16:48,510
I told you my way
was best, Davey.

339
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:53,281
We don't want no trouble.

340
00:16:57,452 --> 00:16:59,588
Now, I want you to get
the fuck outta here.

341
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:02,792
When I'm ready.

342
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,328
All right.

343
00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:10,566
Have it your way.

344
00:17:12,968 --> 00:17:16,372
You know, I think I forgot
my smokes in the car.

345
00:17:16,404 --> 00:17:17,906
You need a cigarette?
I got it here.

346
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,875
No, you know,
I got a fresh pack in the car.

347
00:17:19,907 --> 00:17:21,676
Thank you.
Be right back.

348
00:17:28,683 --> 00:17:32,020
Look, Davey, why don't
you two guys try working?

349
00:17:32,054 --> 00:17:34,723
What you're doing out there
is destroying the neighborhood.

350
00:17:34,756 --> 00:17:36,192
Well, I got a job, Dezy.

351
00:17:36,224 --> 00:17:38,026
Where? Selling shit
in the park?

352
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:40,395
Come on, Davey,
that's not a job.

353
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:42,431
What shit are you
selling in here?

354
00:17:42,463 --> 00:17:45,701
My fucking father sat in this
bar for 20 years.

355
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:47,470
He pissed away
every dime he ever made.

356
00:17:47,502 --> 00:17:48,636
Your father was a good man.

357
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,406
My father was a piece of shit.

358
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:51,974
No, your father took care of you,
your mother,

359
00:17:52,007 --> 00:17:53,875
your brother, your sister.
He took care of you.

360
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:55,678
You never had to live with him.
You didn't have to...

361
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,313
Every day. I know I didn't have
to live with him.

362
00:17:57,346 --> 00:17:58,646
- But what do you...
- Shut the fuck...

363
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:08,724
Oh, God.

364
00:18:14,262 --> 00:18:17,599
This is Dave Willis.
Uh, yes, sir.

365
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:22,437
Yes, sir, I'm gonna
stand right here.

366
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:24,006
Okay, I'll be right here.

367
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:25,273
Bye.

368
00:18:27,476 --> 00:18:28,544
Fuck.

369
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:34,282
Mike went out for cigarettes.

370
00:18:35,517 --> 00:18:37,486
Cigarettes.

371
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:39,454
Detective, how many
times do I have to tell you?

372
00:18:39,488 --> 00:18:41,390
I mean, I already
told you in the other room.

373
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:44,393
I want to hear it again.

374
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:47,529
I went out to my car

375
00:18:47,563 --> 00:18:49,932
because I left
my cigarettes there.

376
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:51,399
So I had a cigarette.

377
00:18:53,902 --> 00:18:55,837
Must've been one hell
of a cigarette, huh?

378
00:18:58,973 --> 00:19:01,910
And that's when I saw the guy
come out of the bar.

379
00:19:05,047 --> 00:19:06,816
Can you identify this guy?

380
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:08,584
No.

381
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:10,920
He was wearing a ski mask.

382
00:19:12,721 --> 00:19:15,258
How about you?
You know who this guy is?

383
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:18,494
No.

384
00:19:18,527 --> 00:19:22,831
Do you, uh... Do you believe
your friend here?

385
00:19:22,864 --> 00:19:24,850
Yeah.

386
00:19:24,851 --> 00:19:26,835
Is that right?

387
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:32,508
So, nobody knows about this
mysterious masked man, huh?

388
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,409
I mean, how are we
supposed to know?

389
00:19:34,442 --> 00:19:39,214
It's probably some guy whose,
you know, drinks he watered down.

390
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,788
You know...

391
00:19:48,222 --> 00:19:50,326
If you had nothing
to do with it,

392
00:19:50,358 --> 00:19:51,859
there's a guy
out there wondering

393
00:19:51,893 --> 00:19:53,229
if you can make him.

394
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,865
And if you did have
something to do with it...

395
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:02,238
I've been at this game
a lot longer than you two.

396
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,675
Fucking cops, man.

397
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:09,546
Could have at least brought
my fucking car over here,

398
00:20:09,547 --> 00:20:10,547
leave it by the park.

399
00:20:10,578 --> 00:20:12,480
Somebody's gonna fucking
break into it. Jeez.

400
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:13,915
You don't ever stop.

401
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,118
You just fucking
killed somebody, Mike.

402
00:20:17,152 --> 00:20:20,489
Say that again and you will fucking
regret it, all right?

403
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:21,923
I wasn't even there.

404
00:20:23,592 --> 00:20:25,694
It's fucking...
It's over for me. I'm done.

405
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,979
Hey, Davey...

406
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,230
Don't fucking touch me!

407
00:20:28,262 --> 00:20:30,932
Hey! Come on, Davey.

408
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:33,101
Look, I've got... I've got some pure
stuff back in my house.

409
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:36,105
So, why don't we just go and
we forget about this, all right?

410
00:20:36,137 --> 00:20:37,572
Huh? What do you say?

411
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,708
Hey, where are you going?

412
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:41,876
I'm going home!

413
00:21:01,395 --> 00:21:03,565
Yo, you're doing
a pickup today.

414
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:05,000
Today, and that's it.

415
00:21:05,032 --> 00:21:06,834
Yeah, you better keep
your mouth shut.

416
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:07,869
I do.

417
00:21:07,903 --> 00:21:09,704
Yeah, I knew that
till last night.

418
00:21:22,851 --> 00:21:25,988
Dave, you wanna
try getting up? It's 12:30.

419
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,423
Just a second.

420
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,994
Want me to fix you
some breakfast?

421
00:21:33,028 --> 00:21:34,896
Nah, I'm okay.

422
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:38,334
Are you gonna come to Bernard's
football game with me?

423
00:21:38,366 --> 00:21:40,302
I can't today, Ma, I'm busy.

424
00:21:41,202 --> 00:21:42,503
What are you so busy with?

425
00:21:42,537 --> 00:21:45,074
All right, Ma.
Please don't start.

426
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:47,042
I gotta roll.

427
00:21:53,781 --> 00:21:55,350
32.71.

428
00:21:56,183 --> 00:22:00,888
I've got 53 and 40 cents.

429
00:22:00,922 --> 00:22:02,391
57.90.

430
00:22:02,423 --> 00:22:04,259
That's five dollars each
to the busboys.

431
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,327
We split the rest, 41 on each.

432
00:22:06,361 --> 00:22:08,263
I don't know, you keep
coming up short, Rita.

433
00:22:08,296 --> 00:22:10,833
- It's not fair.
- "Fare" is something I pay on the subway.

434
00:22:10,865 --> 00:22:13,067
In this restaurant we got rules.
We split the tips.

435
00:22:13,101 --> 00:22:14,803
It just seems like
a raw deal for us.

436
00:22:14,836 --> 00:22:16,404
You're an old lady.
What are you doing here?

437
00:22:16,438 --> 00:22:17,678
Hey. What did you
just call her?

438
00:22:17,705 --> 00:22:19,908
Hey. Here, take it.

439
00:22:21,143 --> 00:22:23,045
I got enough trouble
in my life as it is.

440
00:22:23,077 --> 00:22:25,047
Out here, everybody's
got trouble.

441
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:30,752
Hey, Bobby.

442
00:22:30,786 --> 00:22:32,204
Rough shift?

443
00:22:32,205 --> 00:22:33,622
Yeah.

444
00:22:33,654 --> 00:22:36,157
You look like you don't
punch back enough.

445
00:22:36,191 --> 00:22:37,558
I'm too tired.

446
00:22:37,592 --> 00:22:39,228
No, it's not that.

447
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,064
You look like you let people take
advantage of you.

448
00:22:43,365 --> 00:22:45,634
Just saying, Ann. Not me.

449
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:47,135
Nobody takes advantage of me.

450
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:50,172
If they want something,
I let them have it,

451
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:51,839
or I don't let them have it.

452
00:22:51,873 --> 00:22:54,477
The point is, I call the shots.

453
00:22:55,477 --> 00:22:57,012
You should try it sometime.

454
00:22:59,448 --> 00:23:00,566
Thanks.

455
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:01,684
Hey.

456
00:23:02,717 --> 00:23:04,420
Aw, looky, looky.

457
00:23:10,424 --> 00:23:13,095
Hey, Davey,
Vicki wants to re-up,

458
00:23:13,127 --> 00:23:16,999
so, uh, do me a favor
and drop off a bag.

459
00:23:17,031 --> 00:23:19,967
Oh, you know what? Actually,
drop off two bags. Why not? You know?

460
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:21,769
All right.

461
00:23:21,803 --> 00:23:23,372
Hey, by the way,
you locked the gate, right?

462
00:23:23,404 --> 00:23:24,572
Fuck.
You didn't...

463
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:26,174
- Come on.
- Go with him on the gate.

464
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,092
Jesus.

465
00:23:27,093 --> 00:23:27,876
Come on, guys.

466
00:23:30,144 --> 00:23:32,147
Fucking amateur hour, right?

467
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:42,790
Look at that.
John Hancock and all.

468
00:23:42,824 --> 00:23:44,092
I've gotta take care
of some things.

469
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:44,876
I'll see ya, yeah?

470
00:23:44,877 --> 00:23:45,626
Take it easy.

471
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,296
All righty, man.

472
00:23:47,328 --> 00:23:48,447
Lock the gate.

473
00:23:48,448 --> 00:23:49,565
Yeah, yeah.

474
00:23:49,597 --> 00:23:51,133
I always check the gate.

475
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:56,571
<i>Four years we've been here.</i>

476
00:23:56,605 --> 00:23:59,240
Now, 40 bags unaccounted for.

477
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:01,776
- I signed in for the full amount.
- Yeah, we see you signed.

478
00:24:02,544 --> 00:24:03,946
So where's the money?

479
00:24:06,548 --> 00:24:08,150
Do you find this cool?

480
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:12,788
You find it acceptable
for guys to steal?

481
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,355
I didn't steal from you.

482
00:24:14,356 --> 00:24:15,890
It's unacceptable.

483
00:24:15,923 --> 00:24:20,028
Hey, 200 bags
at 10 bucks a pop.

484
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:22,497
That's 2,000 cash.

485
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,198
We don't take
product back here.

486
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:26,201
We take cash.

487
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:27,903
He's gonna show you the books.

488
00:24:35,576 --> 00:24:38,346
Yo, maybe they
gave you a beat count.

489
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,482
How much you short?

490
00:24:40,515 --> 00:24:42,918
I don't know.
Fifteen hundred.

491
00:24:43,451 --> 00:24:45,287
Fuck.

492
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:50,792
You know, I could give you five, six,
but, you know, that's it.

493
00:24:52,727 --> 00:24:54,696
Come on, let's go to the park,

494
00:24:54,729 --> 00:24:56,198
get to work, you know?

495
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:59,134
No, no, I said I'm out.

496
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,102
I'll figure out a way
to get the money.

497
00:25:09,611 --> 00:25:12,180
Hey, Mr. Willis,
how you doing?

498
00:25:12,212 --> 00:25:14,115
You got a minute?

499
00:25:17,652 --> 00:25:19,288
Yeah.

500
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,622
Let's chat, all right?

501
00:25:21,189 --> 00:25:22,291
Step outside?

502
00:25:23,557 --> 00:25:26,261
Yeah, you know, just smoke?

503
00:25:27,962 --> 00:25:29,064
Sure.

504
00:25:36,938 --> 00:25:39,074
Fixing myself
a little pick-me-up.

505
00:25:41,108 --> 00:25:42,977
Yo, check it.

506
00:25:45,246 --> 00:25:47,182
Huh?

507
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:51,218
Stole this from, uh,
my landlord's garage.

508
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:53,221
Need something
to cook with, you know?

509
00:25:53,253 --> 00:25:55,557
The only way I'm gonna be able
to pay back this cash,

510
00:25:55,589 --> 00:25:57,158
is if I work the park.

511
00:25:57,192 --> 00:25:59,627
I'm only doing this
till I've got the money.

512
00:25:59,661 --> 00:26:01,897
Showing a little
brief intelligence.

513
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,332
Yo, let me talk to Canarsie.

514
00:26:03,365 --> 00:26:05,300
I'll work tonight
if you got anything to sell.

515
00:26:07,969 --> 00:26:09,671
No.

516
00:26:09,703 --> 00:26:12,173
Let me handle Canarsie.
He knows me better.

517
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,742
But, uh,

518
00:26:14,776 --> 00:26:17,179
yeah, you can work
for me tonight.

519
00:26:20,515 --> 00:26:23,118
This should help send you
on your road to recovery.

520
00:26:24,184 --> 00:26:26,954
<i> Squeezing her knees
We despise</i>

521
00:26:26,988 --> 00:26:29,758
<i> Blowing apart
Shaking her hair</i>

522
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:33,861
<i> Fuck you The promised land </i>

523
00:26:57,751 --> 00:26:59,387
Makes you feel like

524
00:27:00,855 --> 00:27:02,089
your lungs are expanding,

525
00:27:02,123 --> 00:27:05,027
and you're breathing
mountain air.

526
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:13,935
That's right. Yeah.

527
00:27:17,337 --> 00:27:19,106
Hey, you know, Dave, he...
He's all right.

528
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,009
What's your problem?
Huh?

529
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:23,945
He just walked in.
I'll call you back.

530
00:27:27,882 --> 00:27:30,052
You were saying?

531
00:27:30,085 --> 00:27:32,254
My boy, Dave, he's...
He's all right, yeah.

532
00:27:32,287 --> 00:27:34,789
Yeah?
What was he doing at the bar?

533
00:27:35,723 --> 00:27:36,591
A mistake.

534
00:27:36,592 --> 00:27:37,458
Yeah, a mistake?

535
00:27:37,491 --> 00:27:38,626
Been a lot of mistakes.

536
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,296
Come on. He's cool.
He's, you know...

537
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:42,830
He was talking to a cop.

538
00:27:42,864 --> 00:27:44,066
Nah. Dave?
Yeah.

539
00:27:44,098 --> 00:27:45,634
Now, come on,
he wouldn't do that.

540
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:47,001
I was there.

541
00:27:47,035 --> 00:27:49,037
And then Canarsie said
that you said

542
00:27:49,069 --> 00:27:51,239
that he was extremely
nervous at the bar.

543
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:53,741
Who told you to do
a fucking interview with a cop?

544
00:27:53,775 --> 00:27:55,877
You were supposed
to be out of there.

545
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,079
It's taken care of, isn't it?

546
00:27:57,112 --> 00:27:58,779
It's not taken care of!

547
00:27:58,813 --> 00:28:00,933
I'll say when it's fucking taken
care of, you hear me?

548
00:28:00,949 --> 00:28:02,884
When I say, not you.

549
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:04,685
Where's my money?
That's what I wanna know.

550
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:05,921
Where's my money?

551
00:28:05,953 --> 00:28:07,154
- He's working on it.
- Mmm-hmm.

552
00:28:07,188 --> 00:28:08,490
When am I gonna get
my two grand?

553
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:09,690
He's working on it.

554
00:28:09,723 --> 00:28:10,991
He's doing shit.
I'll handle it.

555
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:12,227
Get the fuck out.

556
00:28:13,161 --> 00:28:15,096
Get the fuck out.
Come on!

557
00:28:16,463 --> 00:28:18,599
You make me sick.

558
00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:20,001
Can't you borrow it?

559
00:28:20,002 --> 00:28:21,369
From where, Mike?

560
00:28:21,402 --> 00:28:22,671
Anywhere, fuck!

561
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:23,871
You keep fucking telling me

562
00:28:23,904 --> 00:28:25,307
that everybody's
making fortunes,

563
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:26,875
so why are they hustling me
so much for two grand?

564
00:28:26,907 --> 00:28:28,142
You want me
to tell you why, Davey?

565
00:28:28,175 --> 00:28:29,845
You want me to tell you?

566
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:33,380
Because they think maybe
you're doing this deliberately.

567
00:28:33,413 --> 00:28:34,516
What?

568
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:37,418
Yeah, they think maybe
you know too much.

569
00:28:37,451 --> 00:28:41,189
You know. You're in a position to
take advantage of them.

570
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:44,792
Yeah, look, Davey, you gotta clear up
that cash and fast.

571
00:28:44,826 --> 00:28:46,928
You gotta.

572
00:28:46,961 --> 00:28:48,430
I'd help you, but I'm strapped.

573
00:28:50,498 --> 00:28:52,100
Just meet me in the park
in a couple hours

574
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:53,936
and we'll work this out, okay?

575
00:28:54,803 --> 00:28:56,304
Okay.

576
00:28:56,336 --> 00:28:59,540
And, look, you gotta stop
talking to the cops.

577
00:28:59,574 --> 00:29:00,942
I said nothing.

578
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,412
Fuck.

579
00:29:11,952 --> 00:29:14,655
Hey, I'm glad you're here.

580
00:29:14,689 --> 00:29:17,392
Come on.
Give me a hand.

581
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:20,428
This is the one thing your father
always used to do.

582
00:29:21,395 --> 00:29:22,763
When he wasn't drunk?

583
00:29:22,797 --> 00:29:24,766
Ah, come on,
don't start with me.

584
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:27,969
All I remember is him drunk on
the couch, cigarette burning.

585
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:29,971
I made a noise,
he'd be screaming.

586
00:29:30,003 --> 00:29:32,106
He was your father.
He loved you.

587
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,109
You respect him no matter what.

588
00:29:34,142 --> 00:29:35,376
Respect him? Ma, everybody
on the corner's

589
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:37,077
still making jokes about him,

590
00:29:37,111 --> 00:29:39,214
saying he still owes them money,
my father.

591
00:29:44,685 --> 00:29:46,320
We never had a day's peace.

592
00:29:52,527 --> 00:29:56,164
People are still banging on the door,
threatening us.

593
00:30:03,503 --> 00:30:06,107
I had to hand over
my mother's wedding ring.

594
00:30:08,876 --> 00:30:10,479
Everything I had.

595
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:20,923
Hey, you pick that up.

596
00:30:22,056 --> 00:30:23,826
I said pick it up.

597
00:30:38,673 --> 00:30:39,942
Let's go.

598
00:31:16,678 --> 00:31:18,247
Are you a rat?

599
00:31:21,682 --> 00:31:23,585
I said, are you a rat?

600
00:31:24,751 --> 00:31:26,587
I never snitched on nobody.

601
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,893
Mike...

602
00:31:31,925 --> 00:31:35,329
Mike knows. Hey, tell him I never
snitched on nobody.

603
00:31:38,266 --> 00:31:40,368
Yo, Mike, the fuck do you...

604
00:31:40,401 --> 00:31:42,237
Honestly, I didn't say
a fucking thing, Mike.

605
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:45,205
Tell him I didn't say
a fucking thing.

606
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:47,159
I didn't talk to the police.
I didn't say a word.

607
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:50,912
Yo, Mike, say something, man.

608
00:31:50,944 --> 00:31:53,114
Mike, say something.
You got...

609
00:31:53,146 --> 00:31:54,649
You fucking say
something, Mike.

610
00:31:56,084 --> 00:31:58,853
Don't just fucking sit there.

611
00:31:58,885 --> 00:32:00,154
Yo, Canarsie,
I didn't do nothing.

612
00:32:00,188 --> 00:32:02,257
I never said nothing.
I swear to God.

613
00:32:03,891 --> 00:32:05,560
Yo, Mike, tell them.

614
00:32:05,593 --> 00:32:08,363
Mike, you fucking
tell them I didn't say anything!

615
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:15,036
Please, I didn't say nothing!

616
00:32:15,068 --> 00:32:16,637
Please!

617
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,075
Ah!

618
00:32:32,987 --> 00:32:34,456
Get the fucking car
out of here.

619
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:36,458
Come on, go.

620
00:32:50,671 --> 00:32:51,673
Fuck.

621
00:33:01,615 --> 00:33:03,151
Die, you fucking rat.

622
00:33:39,687 --> 00:33:40,456
Hey.

623
00:33:40,556 --> 00:33:41,256
Hey.

624
00:33:46,027 --> 00:33:47,461
Where did he go in?

625
00:33:47,494 --> 00:33:49,096
Picked him up
near the fence there.

626
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,732
Let's take a look.

627
00:33:58,138 --> 00:34:02,343
This is the, uh, kid from the bar
the other night.

628
00:34:05,012 --> 00:34:07,148
I tried to talk to him.

629
00:34:07,181 --> 00:34:10,085
I guess he didn't know how to stay
out of trouble.

630
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:15,423
Another dead body comes out
of this canal, huh?

631
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:21,730
All right.

632
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:41,733
Yes?

633
00:34:41,734 --> 00:34:43,051
Are you Mrs. Willis?

634
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:44,284
I am.

635
00:34:44,318 --> 00:34:47,522
I'm Detective Hogan
from the NYPD.

636
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:53,293
He was, unfortunately, killed.

637
00:34:53,327 --> 00:34:55,397
Oh, God.

638
00:35:45,012 --> 00:35:49,350
I keep feeling like this is a story
I'm watching on the news.

639
00:35:49,382 --> 00:35:51,519
You're gonna get
through this, you know?

640
00:35:52,186 --> 00:35:54,222
I'm right here.

641
00:35:54,255 --> 00:35:56,490
Thank you for
being here for me.

642
00:35:56,523 --> 00:35:58,759
You'd do the same for me,
are you kidding?

643
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:00,695
Come on.

644
00:36:00,728 --> 00:36:03,331
You got to be strong.
You have two kids.

645
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:06,467
They're strong.
They're going to be okay.

646
00:36:13,007 --> 00:36:15,643
Mrs. Willis, thanks
for coming in today.

647
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:19,047
Again, my condolences
for your loss.

648
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:21,348
Thank you.

649
00:36:21,382 --> 00:36:22,983
You're sure you're
up for this today?

650
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:24,985
Yes.

651
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:27,521
This came in from
the medical examiner.

652
00:36:31,025 --> 00:36:34,195
Born May 17, 1992.

653
00:36:34,228 --> 00:36:36,364
Died November 8th.

654
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,168
I guess this is all you get.

655
00:36:41,202 --> 00:36:45,073
Miss Willis, this type of crime
usually involves drugs,

656
00:36:45,106 --> 00:36:48,613
and I'm a bit concerned

657
00:36:48,614 --> 00:36:51,614
with the company your son kept.

658
00:36:51,646 --> 00:36:53,682
What company are
you talking about?

659
00:36:54,382 --> 00:36:56,284
My son was murdered.

660
00:36:56,317 --> 00:36:59,519
Did you realize that we had him in
here for questioning two weeks ago?

661
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:01,588
No, he never
told me. What for?

662
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:03,290
He was a witness to a murder,

663
00:37:03,324 --> 00:37:06,561
and we believed that he might be
protecting his friend.

664
00:37:06,594 --> 00:37:08,396
Who? Why would
he do that?

665
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:11,666
What do you know about his
relationship with a Michael J. Vardi?

666
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,702
Michael?

667
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:16,604
They've known each other
since they were kids.

668
00:37:16,637 --> 00:37:18,439
They worked together.
I never liked him.

669
00:37:18,472 --> 00:37:19,874
I always thought
he was trouble.

670
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:22,844
We believe that Vardi
was part of a drug gang.

671
00:37:22,876 --> 00:37:24,328
Do you know
anything about that?

672
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:25,779
No, of course not.

673
00:37:25,813 --> 00:37:28,449
What does any of this
have to do with Dave?

674
00:37:28,481 --> 00:37:31,418
That's what we're
trying to figure out.

675
00:37:31,452 --> 00:37:35,156
Detective,
my son was a good kid.

676
00:37:35,188 --> 00:37:36,824
You have to believe that.

677
00:37:38,693 --> 00:37:42,764
Yeah. Listen, I know
this is difficult,

678
00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:44,398
but if you remember anything,

679
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:48,402
no detail too small,
you give me a buzz, okay?

680
00:38:01,414 --> 00:38:02,617
Oh, come on, honey.

681
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:05,420
Don't you have something
better to do?

682
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:06,737
Where's your brother?

683
00:38:06,738 --> 00:38:08,021
Still sleeping.

684
00:38:08,054 --> 00:38:11,125
12:00 on a Saturday?
He's late for football.

685
00:38:11,157 --> 00:38:12,860
Mom, Bernard
doesn't want to go.

686
00:38:12,893 --> 00:38:14,628
He told me he can't
face anybody.

687
00:38:14,661 --> 00:38:15,962
I don't understand.

688
00:38:15,996 --> 00:38:17,932
The kids at school
are saying mean stuff.

689
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:19,567
Well, they don't know
what they're saying.

690
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,235
Dave was not some criminal.

691
00:38:21,268 --> 00:38:24,005
Bernard, you have to get up.

692
00:38:24,038 --> 00:38:26,641
Bernard, you have to get up
and go to football!

693
00:38:28,842 --> 00:38:31,745
Hey, Vardi, these guys
want to talk.

694
00:38:31,778 --> 00:38:33,882
I already talked to them, boss.

695
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:38,853
How are you doing, Michael?
How are you feeling?

696
00:38:38,885 --> 00:38:41,322
You don't, uh...
You don't look so good.

697
00:38:41,355 --> 00:38:43,791
Gee, thanks, Detective.

698
00:38:43,824 --> 00:38:46,193
I'd like to ask you again.

699
00:38:46,226 --> 00:38:49,329
You say you never
saw Dave that night, is that right?

700
00:38:49,362 --> 00:38:50,731
Just here.

701
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,467
How about after work?

702
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:57,105
Oh, see, I went home
and I went to bed.

703
00:38:57,137 --> 00:39:00,375
You know, he didn't tell
me what he was doing.

704
00:39:00,407 --> 00:39:02,009
That was it?

705
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:05,011
What do you want me to say?
I was in bed.

706
00:39:05,045 --> 00:39:08,849
You know, it's funny. We found a gun
in the sewer out back.

707
00:39:08,882 --> 00:39:10,684
The guy who came running in
right after the shooting

708
00:39:10,717 --> 00:39:12,452
said he didn't see nobody
going out the front,

709
00:39:12,485 --> 00:39:15,056
so what do you make of that?

710
00:39:15,088 --> 00:39:17,625
I told you what
I saw, Detective.

711
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:22,362
You sure you weren't
out for a cigarette?

712
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,804
I'll get back to you.

713
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:37,245
Okay, okay, I get that,
but what about Vardi?

714
00:39:37,277 --> 00:39:38,679
Have you questioned him?

715
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,080
Yeah, but he's not talking.

716
00:39:40,114 --> 00:39:42,483
But don't worry, something's
gotta give. It always does, right?

717
00:39:42,516 --> 00:39:44,952
It's not like these people are gonna
line up to chat with me.

718
00:39:46,353 --> 00:39:48,456
That's it.
Hey, Mrs. Willis,

719
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:49,540
how are you? Okay.

720
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:50,590
Okay, thanks.

721
00:39:50,623 --> 00:39:51,858
Ready?
It's time?

722
00:39:51,891 --> 00:39:52,959
Yeah.

723
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,027
We gotta run.

724
00:39:54,061 --> 00:39:55,863
Oh, good, where to?

725
00:39:55,896 --> 00:39:56,831
Berryville.

726
00:39:56,832 --> 00:39:57,765
Berryville?

727
00:39:57,797 --> 00:39:58,715
Yeah, we're hunting.

728
00:39:58,716 --> 00:39:59,633
Hunting?

729
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:00,867
Boom!

730
00:40:00,868 --> 00:40:02,068
Is something up there?

731
00:40:02,101 --> 00:40:03,336
Yeah, deer.

732
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:05,739
No, I mean with the case.
Who is in Berryville?

733
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:10,211
We are. We've got off
till Friday at 4:00.

734
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:11,612
Off? Why?

735
00:40:11,644 --> 00:40:13,980
Because we're off.
Come on, let's go.

736
00:40:14,014 --> 00:40:16,617
Listen, I'll call you when we
get back on Friday, okay?

737
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,885
Uh, um, can I just
use the bathroom?

738
00:40:18,918 --> 00:40:21,088
It's the second door
on the left.

739
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:41,224
Ooh, these look pretty good.

740
00:40:41,225 --> 00:40:42,709
Mmm-hmm.

741
00:40:42,742 --> 00:40:44,945
Mmm... Come on, why don't
you leave it alone?

742
00:40:44,978 --> 00:40:46,913
- Give it a rest for a while.
- No, I can't.

743
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:48,583
- Why?
- The police aren't doing anything to help me.

744
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:51,452
Yeah, but you're
not the police. Go on.

745
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:54,054
Wow.

746
00:40:55,889 --> 00:40:57,123
Looky, looky.

747
00:40:57,157 --> 00:40:58,459
Look at you.

748
00:40:58,492 --> 00:41:00,278
It's because you're so hot.

749
00:41:00,279 --> 00:41:02,063
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

750
00:41:02,096 --> 00:41:03,898
Why don't you go spend that?

751
00:41:05,431 --> 00:41:08,101
Hey, Rita!
Peg and I have decided

752
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:10,338
we're not gonna split our tips
with you anymore.

753
00:41:10,371 --> 00:41:11,573
You're on your own.

754
00:41:12,273 --> 00:41:14,008
Whatever, bitches.

755
00:41:16,543 --> 00:41:18,746
Good girl, you're doing
your homework.

756
00:41:19,746 --> 00:41:21,681
You going out, too?

757
00:41:21,715 --> 00:41:24,719
Just for a little bit.
Keep the door locked.

758
00:41:24,751 --> 00:41:25,736
What about dinner?

759
00:41:25,737 --> 00:41:26,721
I'll bring home pizza.

760
00:41:26,753 --> 00:41:28,722
Okay, pizza's fine.

761
00:41:28,755 --> 00:41:29,857
I love you.

762
00:41:29,858 --> 00:41:30,958
Love you, too.

763
00:41:43,971 --> 00:41:45,023
They're fucking late.

764
00:41:45,024 --> 00:41:46,074
Michael.

765
00:41:48,242 --> 00:41:49,544
Fuck.

766
00:41:51,445 --> 00:41:53,748
I gotta deal with this bitch
real quick, man.

767
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,215
Handle your business.

768
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:01,221
Need a lift?

769
00:42:02,655 --> 00:42:04,424
No, you know, I'm good.

770
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:05,593
You sure?

771
00:42:05,626 --> 00:42:09,497
Come on, get in.
It's raining.

772
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:13,034
Yeah, all right, why not?

773
00:42:24,744 --> 00:42:26,614
What's up?
Ten for 90.

774
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:36,990
I never sleep.

775
00:42:39,793 --> 00:42:41,329
I keep hearing Dave...

776
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:46,433
I keep hearing
Dave's voice crying out in the night.

777
00:42:46,467 --> 00:42:48,903
He's begging for his life.

778
00:42:48,936 --> 00:42:52,106
He keeps trying to tell me who
did this to him.

779
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:54,108
I fight really hard
to hear him,

780
00:42:54,141 --> 00:42:56,210
but I just can't
quite make it out.

781
00:42:57,911 --> 00:43:00,114
You were so close to him.

782
00:43:00,146 --> 00:43:01,782
You must hear him.

783
00:43:03,016 --> 00:43:04,784
Do you?

784
00:43:04,818 --> 00:43:07,589
Do you hear him
crying out in the night?

785
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:25,972
Yeah, I gotta get in.

786
00:43:26,005 --> 00:43:28,308
Why? What's your rush?

787
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:33,280
You know, I... I...
I didn't have a...

788
00:43:36,315 --> 00:43:38,852
It's just a shame
I wasn't around, you know?

789
00:43:38,885 --> 00:43:41,422
Yeah, why didn't you
come to his funeral?

790
00:43:41,454 --> 00:43:43,190
You were his friend.

791
00:43:43,222 --> 00:43:47,061
Yeah, I mean,
I wanted to, I just...

792
00:43:48,594 --> 00:43:51,131
I was too upset, you know?

793
00:43:51,164 --> 00:43:55,670
You sure you weren't,
I don't know, scared?

794
00:43:57,003 --> 00:43:58,121
What?

795
00:43:58,122 --> 00:43:59,239
Good night, Michael.

796
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,244
Oh, by the way,
hey, would you mind

797
00:44:03,277 --> 00:44:04,878
giving me your
cell phone number?

798
00:44:04,911 --> 00:44:06,847
You know, just in case
I ever need to call you.

799
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,152
My cell?
Uh, yeah, it's, uh...

800
00:44:11,184 --> 00:44:15,757
917-289-0796.

801
00:44:18,759 --> 00:44:20,228
Good night.

802
00:45:40,773 --> 00:45:43,210
<i>Yeah, I mean, I...
I wanted to,</i>

803
00:45:43,242 --> 00:45:46,480
<i>but, uh, I was too upset.</i>

804
00:45:46,512 --> 00:45:51,052
<i>You sure you weren't,
I don't know, scared?</i>

805
00:45:56,856 --> 00:45:58,726
Next time you
get a sleeve, all right?

806
00:45:58,759 --> 00:46:00,394
Get outta here.

807
00:46:04,898 --> 00:46:07,268
This shit's raw, all right?

808
00:46:19,512 --> 00:46:21,414
What are you
doing here, old lady?

809
00:46:22,615 --> 00:46:24,018
I wanna buy salts.

810
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:26,319
Well, there's a pharmacy
three blocks that way.

811
00:46:26,353 --> 00:46:28,489
I wanna buy salts.

812
00:46:28,521 --> 00:46:29,990
You a cop?

813
00:46:31,324 --> 00:46:34,828
Is Mike here?
He'd sell to me.

814
00:46:34,862 --> 00:46:37,865
Mike don't know
an old lady like you.

815
00:46:37,898 --> 00:46:40,201
I was also a friend of Dave's.

816
00:46:42,869 --> 00:46:44,438
I didn't like Dave.

817
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:46,840
Did you know I was the last one
to see him alive?

818
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,210
Really?

819
00:46:50,744 --> 00:46:53,146
That's what's been said.

820
00:46:53,179 --> 00:46:56,616
But Mike, really, was
the last one to see him.

821
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:58,519
I got things I gotta do.

822
00:46:58,552 --> 00:47:00,021
Good luck.

823
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,286

824

832
00:48:06,052 --> 00:48:07,454
Have a seat.

833
00:48:10,222 --> 00:48:12,293
Yeah, how's your day going?

834
00:48:14,728 --> 00:48:16,329
Good, thanks.

835
00:48:18,831 --> 00:48:20,268
Buy you a drink?

836
00:48:22,302 --> 00:48:24,472
Don't worry.
I don't bite.

837
00:48:26,139 --> 00:48:28,242
- I'll have what you're having.
- All right.

838
00:48:28,275 --> 00:48:30,443
Can we get two shots
of Patron, please?

839
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,516
So, what's your name?

840
00:48:36,615 --> 00:48:40,221
Big Tommy.
Big, Big Tommy.

841
00:48:40,987 --> 00:48:42,989
What's yours?

842
00:48:43,023 --> 00:48:44,308
Mary.

843
00:48:44,409 --> 00:48:45,592
Mary.

844
00:48:45,625 --> 00:48:47,460
I love that name.

845
00:48:47,494 --> 00:48:51,097
<i> Mary, Mary </i>

846
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:53,166
Look what we have here, Mary.

847
00:48:54,434 --> 00:48:56,370
Thank you very much,
sweetheart.

848
00:48:56,402 --> 00:49:00,039
That's for you.
Bottom's up, Mary.

849
00:49:00,072 --> 00:49:01,291
Here's to you, Big Tommy.

850
00:49:01,292 --> 00:49:02,509
Mmm-hmm.

851
00:49:03,909 --> 00:49:06,379
Ah. Whoo.

852
00:49:07,313 --> 00:49:09,315
Who's the guy with the kid?

853
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:11,418
Ah. What's it
matter, honey?

854
00:49:11,451 --> 00:49:13,586
Am I not what
you're looking for?

855
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:15,121
I'm a dynamo.

856
00:49:16,655 --> 00:49:17,874
Who is he?

857
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:19,092
That's Blackie.

858
00:49:19,126 --> 00:49:20,761
He's a wise guy.

859
00:49:20,793 --> 00:49:23,429
Hangs out at the social club
on President Street.

860
00:49:23,463 --> 00:49:25,265
You don't wanna talk to them.

861
00:49:25,297 --> 00:49:27,600
Let's discuss our future.

862
00:49:28,802 --> 00:49:30,170
Thanks for the drink.

863
00:49:30,202 --> 00:49:31,821
Wait. What?

864
00:49:31,822 --> 00:49:33,440
I gotta go.

865
00:49:33,472 --> 00:49:35,241
I gotta pick up
my kid at school.

866
00:49:35,275 --> 00:49:36,943
Next time it's on me,
Big Tommy.

867
00:49:36,976 --> 00:49:39,512
Ah! Tsk!

868
00:49:40,246 --> 00:49:42,015
Hey, sweetheart.

869
00:49:58,965 --> 00:50:00,867
Hey!

870
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,169
What are you doing?
Huh?

871
00:50:03,202 --> 00:50:04,905
What are you doing here?

872
00:50:04,938 --> 00:50:07,708
Obviously you wanna see your son
quicker than you think.

873
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,275
Am I making you nervous?

874
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:11,979
You're not making me nervous.
You're giving me a pain.

875
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:14,548
Why don't you get the hell outta
here? You don't belong here.

876
00:50:15,648 --> 00:50:17,417
I'm just drinking my coffee.

877
00:50:17,451 --> 00:50:18,652
You better behave yourself,

878
00:50:18,684 --> 00:50:20,753
'cause I don't
discriminate, okay?

879
00:50:20,786 --> 00:50:23,089
Take your cell phone
and get the hell outta here,

880
00:50:23,123 --> 00:50:24,724
if you know
what's good for you.

881
00:50:36,735 --> 00:50:40,007
Detective Hogan,
so how's it going?

882
00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:42,875
We had a cop killed from this
precinct over the weekend.

883
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:45,479
Yeah, I heard.
I'm sorry.

884
00:50:45,512 --> 00:50:47,815
I thought maybe
there was a connection.

885
00:50:47,847 --> 00:50:48,949
To what? Your son?

886
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:50,050
Yeah.

887
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:53,987
I have no idea. Right now my priority
is to catch a cop killer, okay?

888
00:50:54,019 --> 00:50:55,688
Well, I understand.

889
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:57,925
Really?
I don't think you do,

890
00:50:57,958 --> 00:51:00,059
'cause you keep waltzing in
here trying to stop everything

891
00:51:00,092 --> 00:51:02,395
to figure out who killed your son,
the drug dealer.

892
00:51:02,429 --> 00:51:04,565
Who the hell are you
to call my son a drug dealer?

893
00:51:04,597 --> 00:51:06,833
We've got other
priorities right now.

894
00:51:06,867 --> 00:51:08,669
Do you understand?

895
00:51:08,702 --> 00:51:10,771
We've had a rough
couple of days.

896
00:51:12,806 --> 00:51:15,641
Well, I'm sorry.

897
00:51:15,675 --> 00:51:19,278
Look, what about this Blackie guy?
What's his connection?

898
00:51:19,311 --> 00:51:20,563
Where did you get that from?

899
00:51:20,564 --> 00:51:21,815
Around.

900
00:51:21,847 --> 00:51:26,152
Look, I'm telling you,
stay away. Okay?

901
00:51:26,186 --> 00:51:28,655
Especially from this Blackie.
You understand?

902
00:51:28,688 --> 00:51:31,157
Well, does he have anything to do
with Dave's murder?

903
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:33,192
Ann, stop trying to play cop.

904
00:51:33,226 --> 00:51:35,662
You're in way over your head.

905
00:51:35,695 --> 00:51:38,565
Now go home,
take care of your kids.

906
00:51:38,597 --> 00:51:39,733
They need you.

907
00:51:43,503 --> 00:51:45,338
Excuse me,
are you Mrs. Grotze?

908
00:51:45,339 --> 00:51:47,173
Yes.

909
00:51:47,206 --> 00:51:49,775
Did you get
Detective Hogan's message?

910
00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:51,461
Are you with the police?

911
00:51:51,462 --> 00:51:53,113
I'm working this case.

912
00:51:53,146 --> 00:51:55,516
I fell asleep
watching television

913
00:51:55,548 --> 00:51:58,317
and so I got up
to take my medication

914
00:51:58,351 --> 00:52:02,422
and I heard screeching tires
and I looked outside.

915
00:52:02,454 --> 00:52:04,757
Yeah, I'm just gonna
tape this for our records.

916
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:09,062
A big truck bumped
into the light pole

917
00:52:09,094 --> 00:52:11,564
and the driver jumped off.

918
00:52:11,597 --> 00:52:13,599
Did you see what
he looked like?

919
00:52:13,632 --> 00:52:15,902
A small guy with a hat.

920
00:52:15,936 --> 00:52:17,905
Like those baseball caps
that the kids wear.

921
00:52:17,906 --> 00:52:19,873
Yeah, uh-huh.

922
00:52:19,905 --> 00:52:23,710
And then two other men
came from the canal.

923
00:52:23,742 --> 00:52:26,078
Can you tell me anything else about
what the car looked like?

924
00:52:26,112 --> 00:52:27,914
It was a big car, I remember,

925
00:52:27,947 --> 00:52:30,817
but it was too dark to see
the color of the car.

926
00:52:30,849 --> 00:52:33,886
And then I didn't know
the terrible thing that happened.

927
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,523
Right, well, thank you
very much, Mrs. Grotze,

928
00:52:36,556 --> 00:52:38,458
we'll let you know
if we need anything else.

929
00:54:14,153 --> 00:54:15,655
<i>Michael!</i>

930
00:54:16,822 --> 00:54:18,424
<i>Michael!</i>

931
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:39,278
Is Detective Hogan in?

932
00:54:39,311 --> 00:54:40,713
Ann, Ann, I really
need you now.

933
00:54:40,746 --> 00:54:42,615
I know you gotta do this.
I need help, we got people.

934
00:54:42,648 --> 00:54:44,233
Okay?

935
00:54:44,234 --> 00:54:45,818
Still at court?

936
00:54:45,851 --> 00:54:49,388
Okay. Can you tell him
that Ann Willis called?

937
00:54:49,422 --> 00:54:50,891
Thank you.

938
00:54:52,391 --> 00:54:55,494
What the hell
do I need him for?

939
00:54:55,527 --> 00:54:57,163
Hey, Ann, can I have
a word with you?

940
00:54:57,197 --> 00:54:59,499
Yeah, um, there were
a couple guys in here last night

941
00:54:59,532 --> 00:55:01,134
asking about you
and, uh, frankly,

942
00:55:01,166 --> 00:55:03,302
I don't think they were here
to ask you on a date.

943
00:55:03,335 --> 00:55:04,854
Don't worry about it.

944
00:55:04,855 --> 00:55:06,372
Seriously, these are
not nice guys.

945
00:55:06,405 --> 00:55:08,342
Wise guys.

946
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:10,177
- Can I help you with anything?
- No.

947
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:11,179
You sure?

948
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:13,180
No, it's fine, I can take care of it.

949
00:55:13,213 --> 00:55:15,115
Ann...

950
00:55:42,641 --> 00:55:45,678
Michael. I was just
coming to see you.

951
00:55:45,711 --> 00:55:47,581
I, uh... I'm heading out.

952
00:55:47,614 --> 00:55:49,416
No, just go in
for a minute, please.

953
00:55:49,449 --> 00:55:51,251
I'm just so upset
I don't know who to go to.

954
00:55:51,252 --> 00:55:53,052
For what?

955
00:55:53,085 --> 00:55:54,820
To find out
what's happened to Dave.

956
00:55:54,853 --> 00:55:57,623
Look, you were his best friend.

957
00:55:57,657 --> 00:55:59,226
Cops are useless,
you know that.

958
00:55:59,259 --> 00:56:01,894
Look, can we please just
go inside for a minute?

959
00:56:01,927 --> 00:56:03,730
I can't do this.

960
00:56:03,762 --> 00:56:07,333
Michael, I've known
you a long time.

961
00:56:07,367 --> 00:56:09,803
Come on. Please.

962
00:56:09,835 --> 00:56:12,071
Please, let's just
go in for one minute.

963
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:18,045
All right, one minute,
and that's it.

964
00:56:22,882 --> 00:56:25,018
You got a nice place here.

965
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:36,328
I bet you miss him.

966
00:56:36,362 --> 00:56:37,898
I know I do.

967
00:56:43,503 --> 00:56:45,572
Why don't you pour me a drink?

968
00:57:02,588 --> 00:57:03,956
Thanks.

969
00:57:09,329 --> 00:57:10,731
So, uh...

970
00:57:15,835 --> 00:57:16,869
So?

971
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:18,972
What's this about?

972
00:57:19,005 --> 00:57:21,108
Come on, talk to me, Michael.

973
00:57:24,277 --> 00:57:25,778
About what?

974
00:57:27,347 --> 00:57:29,615
About what happened to Dave.

975
00:57:31,784 --> 00:57:35,622
Look, Mrs. Willis, you know,
I told you I, uh...

976
00:57:37,657 --> 00:57:39,693
I don't know anything
about that.

977
00:57:44,063 --> 00:57:45,699
Tell me something.

978
00:57:49,601 --> 00:57:51,504
Is your car fixed?

979
00:57:53,306 --> 00:57:54,675
Yeah.

980
00:57:58,510 --> 00:57:59,980
What color is your car?

981
00:58:03,181 --> 00:58:04,617
Uh, it's red.

982
00:58:04,618 --> 00:58:06,052
Red.

983
00:58:06,952 --> 00:58:08,054
Yeah.

984
00:58:08,086 --> 00:58:09,655
That's a nice color.

985
00:58:12,224 --> 00:58:13,960
I like black cars.

986
00:58:22,434 --> 00:58:27,273
Like the black car you were in the
night that Dave was murdered.

987
00:58:27,306 --> 00:58:31,010
Yo, you're crazy. I, uh...

988
00:58:31,043 --> 00:58:34,413
No. No, I'm not.

989
00:58:34,447 --> 00:58:36,115
You and Dave were picked up

990
00:58:36,148 --> 00:58:38,551
in a big black car in the park,

991
00:58:38,585 --> 00:58:41,021
and then somebody killed him.

992
00:58:41,054 --> 00:58:44,124
I told you, I, uh...
I wasn't there.

993
00:58:44,157 --> 00:58:46,661
I didn't kill Dave if that's
what you mean.

994
00:58:46,662 --> 00:58:47,662
No.

995
00:58:47,693 --> 00:58:49,228
No.
I know you didn't.

996
00:58:49,262 --> 00:58:51,565
But, you see, I just wanna know
who did, so...

997
00:58:51,597 --> 00:58:53,166
I had nothing to do with that.

998
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:58,605
Look, Dave, uh...
Dave screwed up, okay?

999
00:58:58,637 --> 00:59:01,740
He owed big buck
and he couldn't pay.

1000
00:59:01,773 --> 00:59:03,743
Who couldn't he pay?

1001
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:06,478
Listen, listen.

1002
00:59:06,512 --> 00:59:10,115
Dave was short
on product, okay?

1003
00:59:10,148 --> 00:59:12,985
He was short on product
and these things happen.

1004
00:59:13,018 --> 00:59:15,421
Then he, uh... He got beat.

1005
00:59:15,454 --> 00:59:17,657
All right? He got beat.

1006
00:59:23,429 --> 00:59:25,231
You see this?

1007
00:59:25,264 --> 00:59:29,302
This is from the pole
that the car hit.

1008
00:59:29,335 --> 00:59:30,403
What, uh...

1009
00:59:30,436 --> 00:59:32,038
What are you talking about?

1010
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:34,440
You know, when
the headlight broke,

1011
00:59:34,474 --> 00:59:37,876
when the car hit the pole
when you were driving the car?

1012
00:59:37,909 --> 00:59:40,746
Whose car was it?
I know you were in it.

1013
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:42,349
- I saw your baseball cap.
- No.

1014
00:59:42,382 --> 00:59:44,717
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1015
00:59:46,686 --> 00:59:49,456
Look, you text me
and you text me.

1016
00:59:49,489 --> 00:59:51,324
You gotta stop.

1017
00:59:51,356 --> 00:59:53,125
You gotta stop...

1018
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:55,095
It's okay, Michael.

1019
00:59:55,128 --> 00:59:57,230
You told me everything
I need to know.

1020
01:00:32,699 --> 01:00:34,768
Just get it right
this time, Willy.

1021
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,402
Pink, not red.

1022
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:47,214
Hello?

1023
01:00:49,181 --> 01:00:50,317
Hello?

1024
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:54,453
Who is this?

1025
01:00:54,487 --> 01:00:56,106
What do you want?

1026
01:00:56,107 --> 01:00:57,724
<i>How many kids you got left?</i>

1027
01:00:58,623 --> 01:01:01,226
<i>You wanna see another missing?</i>

1028
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:04,297
Don't you threaten my children
when it's me you want.

1029
01:01:10,769 --> 01:01:11,604
Mike.

1030
01:01:11,605 --> 01:01:12,438
What up?

1031
01:01:12,472 --> 01:01:13,773
What you looking for, brother?

1032
01:01:13,806 --> 01:01:15,041
I need some shit for tonight.

1033
01:01:15,074 --> 01:01:16,409
Yeah, we can probably do that.

1034
01:01:19,911 --> 01:01:20,746
What's up?

1035
01:01:20,747 --> 01:01:21,580
What's good?

1036
01:01:21,614 --> 01:01:22,983
Chilling, chilling.

1037
01:01:25,184 --> 01:01:27,120
Michael, I want you
to listen to this.

1038
01:01:27,152 --> 01:01:29,254
- What the fuck are you playing?
- You know goddamn well what I'm playing!

1039
01:01:29,288 --> 01:01:31,824
Yo, man, get the fuck off of him!
Listen to your own shit.

1040
01:01:31,858 --> 01:01:34,260
You know what this is, Michael.
You listen to this.

1041
01:01:34,293 --> 01:01:36,663
Listen to this! You tell me who
murdered my son!

1042
01:01:36,695 --> 01:01:38,163
I don't know who
fucking killed Dave.

1043
01:01:38,197 --> 01:01:40,867
Your son was a fucking
loser just like you.

1044
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:42,535
- You listen to this!
- You're a fucking loser!

1045
01:01:42,568 --> 01:01:45,405
You listen to this. You tell me
who murdered my son!

1046
01:01:45,438 --> 01:01:47,240
Fuck!

1047
01:01:47,273 --> 01:01:49,909
Little shit.
You little shit. You tell me!

1048
01:01:49,942 --> 01:01:54,481
I know you know
who killed my son, Michael!

1049
01:01:54,514 --> 01:01:56,015
Oh!

1050
01:01:56,047 --> 01:01:58,350
What the fuck you doing, bitch?

1051
01:01:58,384 --> 01:01:59,452
Fuck!

1052
01:02:00,418 --> 01:02:01,754
Fuck!

1053
01:02:05,824 --> 01:02:07,559
She's making me
nervous, you know?

1054
01:02:07,592 --> 01:02:10,629
I mean, she bothers me
fucking day and night, and she knows.

1055
01:02:10,663 --> 01:02:11,867
She fucking knows that...

1056
01:02:11,868 --> 01:02:13,868
You're one crazy little fuck,
you know that?

1057
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,434
Things were perfect for you
till you brought

1058
01:02:15,467 --> 01:02:17,302
your little pussy friend in,
and now you're fucking up

1059
01:02:17,335 --> 01:02:18,904
and I can't have it.

1060
01:02:18,938 --> 01:02:21,206
You're supposed
to sell this shit,

1061
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:22,742
not use it.

1062
01:02:24,277 --> 01:02:26,211
I'm cool, you know,
there's no problem.

1063
01:02:26,244 --> 01:02:28,214
There is from where
I'm standing.

1064
01:02:35,253 --> 01:02:38,223
Did you talk
to that Willis woman?

1065
01:02:38,257 --> 01:02:39,525
No, I just...

1066
01:02:39,526 --> 01:02:40,793
Look at me!

1067
01:02:42,695 --> 01:02:44,264
- I didn't say nothing.
- Did you?

1068
01:02:44,297 --> 01:02:47,067
I didn't say nothing.
I swear, nothing.

1069
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,803
You better not have.

1070
01:03:01,847 --> 01:03:02,981
Fuck!

1071
01:03:26,405 --> 01:03:29,376
Hello? Hello?
Dave, is that you?

1072
01:03:32,711 --> 01:03:36,382
You fucking text and text
and text and text and text!

1073
01:03:38,717 --> 01:03:40,119
Fuck you.

1074
01:03:46,425 --> 01:03:47,928
Fuck you, you bitch!

1075
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:58,270
Fuck. Fuck.

1076
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:05,178
Fuck you! Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1077
01:05:06,105 --> 01:05:08,041
I thought I told you
to lay off Vardi.

1078
01:05:08,074 --> 01:05:09,426
I'm finished with him.

1079
01:05:09,427 --> 01:05:10,777
You're finished, huh?

1080
01:05:10,809 --> 01:05:14,447
When you get off work tomorrow,
go find me another witness, okay?

1081
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,982
What are you talking about?

1082
01:05:15,983 --> 01:05:17,483
He OD'd.

1083
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:22,387
He was our best shot.
You blew it.

1084
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:25,123
Well, I couldn't wait for you.
I had to go talk to him.

1085
01:05:25,157 --> 01:05:26,960
Like you had to go
talk to Mrs. Grotze?

1086
01:05:26,992 --> 01:05:29,996
It was great going over there
after you were through.

1087
01:05:30,028 --> 01:05:31,931
Well, why was it my job
to get there first?

1088
01:05:31,963 --> 01:05:36,034
You keep it up. You got a real knack
for this line of work.

1089
01:05:36,068 --> 01:05:38,871
Now, listen to me,
I need three things.

1090
01:05:38,903 --> 01:05:40,405
The car, the people in the car,

1091
01:05:40,438 --> 01:05:42,942
and to place your son
in that car with those people.

1092
01:05:42,974 --> 01:05:44,610
It's that simple.
One, two, three.

1093
01:05:44,643 --> 01:05:46,545
I don't have those three things,
I don't have a case.

1094
01:05:46,579 --> 01:05:48,615
We don't figure out
who killed your son.

1095
01:05:49,447 --> 01:05:50,849
You understand?

1096
01:05:50,850 --> 01:05:52,251
Fine.

1097
01:05:58,157 --> 01:06:01,059
<i>Come on, you gotta stop
with this detective thing.</i>

1098
01:06:01,092 --> 01:06:03,096
This is dangerous, all right?

1099
01:06:03,128 --> 01:06:05,163
I mean, look at you.
Look at your hands.

1100
01:06:05,197 --> 01:06:07,166
You have to serve people.

1101
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:09,400
Come on, stop this whole thing.
Why don't you just go...

1102
01:06:09,402 --> 01:06:11,104
Go get a manicure, all right?

1103
01:06:11,137 --> 01:06:13,072
I can't afford a manicure.

1104
01:06:13,105 --> 01:06:16,108
Well, I have a million certificates
my dumb boyfriend gave me.

1105
01:06:16,141 --> 01:06:19,111
You can have one,
all right? Come on.

1106
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:26,219
Hi, may I help you?

1107
01:06:26,251 --> 01:06:28,454
Yeah, I have a gift certificate

1108
01:06:28,487 --> 01:06:30,155
for a manicure and a pedicure.

1109
01:06:30,188 --> 01:06:31,323
Okay, we'll call, please.

1110
01:06:31,324 --> 01:06:32,458
Okay.

1111
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:43,168
This is good.

1112
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:02,889
Excuse me, aren't you
Mr. Canarsie's wife?

1113
01:07:02,922 --> 01:07:04,590
Yeah. So?

1114
01:07:05,958 --> 01:07:09,162
My son used to work
for your husband.

1115
01:07:09,195 --> 01:07:11,397
I saw you once
outside the warehouse.

1116
01:07:11,429 --> 01:07:13,865
Oh, oh, that's nice.

1117
01:07:13,898 --> 01:07:15,601
I'm Ann Willis.

1118
01:07:15,634 --> 01:07:17,737
You picked the best day
to be here.

1119
01:07:20,905 --> 01:07:23,708
What does your boy do now?

1120
01:07:23,742 --> 01:07:25,412
His name's Dave.

1121
01:07:26,144 --> 01:07:27,347
He's dead.

1122
01:07:28,914 --> 01:07:31,417
Oh, my God.

1123
01:07:31,449 --> 01:07:34,420
I... I didn't realize
that the boy that...

1124
01:07:35,554 --> 01:07:38,458
Oh, my God, that is terrible.

1125
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:42,427
First your boy
and then Mike Vardi.

1126
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:46,665
He was a nice boy. He worked for my
husband for close to two years.

1127
01:07:47,666 --> 01:07:49,302
Didn't seem like he was cuckoo,

1128
01:07:49,335 --> 01:07:52,271
but then, whew, what he did...

1129
01:07:52,304 --> 01:07:56,409
My husband was very upset
about what happened.

1130
01:07:56,442 --> 01:07:59,679
My neighbor, Mrs. Finito,
she called when she heard

1131
01:07:59,711 --> 01:08:03,382
what happened to Mike
because he rented her garage.

1132
01:08:04,349 --> 01:08:05,985
I can't bring any of this up.

1133
01:08:06,018 --> 01:08:08,253
I can't talk to my husband about
anything these days.

1134
01:08:10,456 --> 01:08:12,057
Do you live
in the neighborhood?

1135
01:08:12,091 --> 01:08:14,060
No, I live over in Bay Ridge.

1136
01:08:14,092 --> 01:08:18,296
I have a cousin who lives
on 80th near Shore.

1137
01:08:18,329 --> 01:08:20,932
I'm on 68th between Shore
and Narrows.

1138
01:08:20,966 --> 01:08:22,368
Oh...

1139
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:23,769
You know what?
I just remembered

1140
01:08:23,801 --> 01:08:27,339
I've gotta go pick up
my kids at school.

1141
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:30,275
It was really nice meeting you.

1142
01:08:30,309 --> 01:08:31,543
Yeah, yeah, it was
nice meeting you, too.

1143
01:08:31,577 --> 01:08:33,713
And I'm really sorry
for your loss.

1144
01:08:40,485 --> 01:08:42,354
Excuse me, do you know
where Mrs. Finito lives?

1145
01:08:42,387 --> 01:08:43,472
Yes, three doors down.

1146
01:08:43,473 --> 01:08:44,556
Thank you so much.

1147
01:08:48,661 --> 01:08:50,796
- Excuse me, are you Mrs. Finito?
- Yeah, why?

1148
01:08:50,828 --> 01:08:52,731
Uh, I'm a friend
of Mr. Canarsie's.

1149
01:08:52,765 --> 01:08:54,600
He said that the car
was in the garage,

1150
01:08:54,632 --> 01:08:56,135
and I left something
in there a couple of weeks ago.

1151
01:08:56,167 --> 01:08:57,135
Oh, sure.

1152
01:08:57,136 --> 01:08:58,103
Thank you so much.

1153
01:09:02,307 --> 01:09:04,743
Take a look.

1154
01:09:04,777 --> 01:09:07,380
You mustn't have needed
your purse for a while.

1155
01:09:07,412 --> 01:09:09,181
This car's been
in here for months.

1156
01:09:09,215 --> 01:09:12,251
No, I forgot that
I spilled my purse

1157
01:09:12,283 --> 01:09:14,819
until I was looking
for my insurance card.

1158
01:09:14,853 --> 01:09:16,922
Oh. You see it?

1159
01:09:17,989 --> 01:09:19,759
No.

1160
01:09:19,792 --> 01:09:22,328
Um, I just remembered
I was in the back seat.

1161
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:25,564
I remember when
I had my kidney problem,

1162
01:09:25,597 --> 01:09:27,432
those doctors won't
even look at you

1163
01:09:27,466 --> 01:09:29,235
without proof of insurance.

1164
01:09:31,703 --> 01:09:32,704
Any luck?

1165
01:09:38,610 --> 01:09:39,912
You got it?

1166
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:43,215
No.

1167
01:09:44,283 --> 01:09:45,752
Ah, tough.

1168
01:09:49,488 --> 01:09:51,524
Thank you very much
for your time.

1169
01:09:51,556 --> 01:09:53,858
I really appreciate it.

1170
01:09:53,891 --> 01:09:55,927
Sure. Uh...

1171
01:09:55,961 --> 01:09:59,199
What's your name again?
Oh, shit.

1172
01:10:16,148 --> 01:10:18,251
Oh, no!

1173
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:35,600
<i>Hi. This is Detective Hogan.</i>

1174
01:10:35,634 --> 01:10:37,936
<i>Please leave a message...</i>

1175
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:39,572
Damn it.

1176
01:10:39,604 --> 01:10:42,474
I found the car.
I found it.

1177
01:10:42,507 --> 01:10:44,443
It's in a garage in Bay Ridge.

1178
01:10:44,475 --> 01:10:47,045
There's a piece of David's
jersey in the car.

1179
01:10:49,881 --> 01:10:51,884
<i>I'm heading to the warehouse.</i>

1180
01:10:51,917 --> 01:10:54,587
<i>I wanna look into the eyes
of the man who killed my son.</i>

1181
01:12:58,342 --> 01:12:59,878
Did you rat me out?

1182
01:12:59,912 --> 01:13:03,349
Huh? Did you rat me out,
you little fucking bitch?

1183
01:13:03,381 --> 01:13:06,085
Is that what you did?

1184
01:13:06,118 --> 01:13:08,120
I'm going to put you where
your son is. How about that?

1185
01:13:08,153 --> 01:13:11,257
Police! Put the gun down.
On the ground.

1186
01:13:11,289 --> 01:13:12,958
Don't move!

1187
01:13:13,492 --> 01:13:15,962
Down. Down.

1188
01:13:27,639 --> 01:13:30,141
I ought to lock you up,
you know that?

1189
01:13:30,175 --> 01:13:32,545
What, do you think
this is a game, huh?

1190
01:13:32,578 --> 01:13:34,580
They killed my son.

1191
01:13:37,582 --> 01:13:38,850
You didn't trust me.

1192
01:13:44,456 --> 01:13:45,757
Give me the phone.

1193
01:13:50,395 --> 01:13:51,998
Get outta here.

1194
01:13:58,237 --> 01:13:59,905
Dave, my sweet boy,

1195
01:14:00,805 --> 01:14:03,174
you brought so much joy,

1196
01:14:03,207 --> 01:14:07,011
love and light
into all of our lives.

1197
01:14:07,045 --> 01:14:10,716
We are grateful for the time
God shared you with us.

1198
01:14:10,748 --> 01:14:14,653
And we will carry you
in our hearts forever.

1199
01:14:14,685 --> 01:14:19,192
So now, my beloved son,
I return you to our heavenly father.

1200
01:14:20,391 --> 01:14:22,661
I pray that you are at peace.

1201
01:14:22,694 --> 01:14:27,500
I will love you forever. And you
will always be in our hearts.

1202
01:14:28,233 --> 01:14:29,802
I love you, Dave.

1203
01:14:29,835 --> 01:14:31,671
I miss you so much.

1204
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:00,665
Ann.

1205
01:15:01,332 --> 01:15:02,127
Hi.

1206
01:15:02,132 --> 01:15:02,867
Hey.

1207
01:15:04,302 --> 01:15:08,673
I, uh, wanted to get
that back to you.

1208
01:15:13,612 --> 01:15:14,947
Thanks.

1209
01:15:15,479 --> 01:15:17,649
Maybe I'll...

1210
01:15:17,682 --> 01:15:19,585
Maybe I'll see you around.

1211
01:15:19,618 --> 01:15:20,953
Wouldn't that be nice?
