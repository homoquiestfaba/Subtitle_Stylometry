1
00:02:51,223 --> 00:02:54,768
- Hands in the head. - You do not need a gun.

2
00:02:54,851 --> 00:02:59,314
- Show me where my son. - Take a walk with me first.

3
00:02:59,398 --> 00:03:02,151
If you ask me, I will kill you.

4
00:03:04,778 --> 00:03:07,615
Do you kill someone feel better?

5
00:03:07,698 --> 00:03:12,245
Revenge ... it does not work like that.

6
00:03:12,495 --> 00:03:17,792
- Vengeance is all I have. - Hold on a bit in this case.

7
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:36,019
One more thing. I have to tell my story to you on the road.

8
00:03:42,902 --> 00:03:45,654
You kill me, you will never know what is.

9
00:04:03,381 --> 00:04:05,675
Story began in the water.

10
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,559
I do not know what you know about surfing, but I'll tell you what I know.

11
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,199
The poor become rich every day in the Pacific.

12
00:04:32,954 --> 00:04:38,001
I learned next to where I live in Sunset Beach, California.

13
00:04:57,146 --> 00:05:01,483
Look at those idiots. They dip their Mexican uniforms.

14
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:06,781
- Dad, they went bankrupt. - What does it cost to buy the rods?

15
00:05:06,864 --> 00:05:11,410
- Clearly a lot. - They can do nothing about the hidden.

16
00:05:12,537 --> 00:05:15,790
- They believe that the Pacific is the lake. - No, they do not respect.

17
00:05:15,873 --> 00:05:18,876
Surprisingly that they take off shoes and socks.

18
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:34,601
- Want to Mexico? - Shit Mexico.

19
00:05:36,645 --> 00:05:41,400
- Remember that ended with him. - Yes, but she knew that she was mine.

20
00:06:10,013 --> 00:06:15,060
- Hell! - Dad!

21
00:06:15,143 --> 00:06:19,773
- It is a family beach, stupid! - It? It used to be Mexico.

22
00:06:19,898 --> 00:06:22,359
Not anymore.

23
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,417
We fight. Give me support.

24
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,011
Damn!

25
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:54,309
Come on!

26
00:06:55,227 --> 00:06:58,188
Enter here!

27
00:07:02,234 --> 00:07:06,614
If I die, I would have hit my brother.

28
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:14,497
- To, Ben. - To, Jeanette.

29
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,126
- I love you. - And I love you.

30
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:23,131
- She was 16. - This is better than 14.

31
00:07:23,214 --> 00:07:26,176
Kevy! Hello ...

32
00:07:29,346 --> 00:07:33,350
- How are you? - Can you breathe?

33
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:39,648
Go to hell. Tell the mother that she gets when I'm ready, okay?

34
00:07:39,732 --> 00:07:44,403
- Certain. Going out? - My neck has been broken! You're there.

35
00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:49,992
- This is not funny. - Sorry.

36
00:07:50,076 --> 00:07:53,663
Look, I have trained a new trick and you get the picture.

37
00:07:53,746 --> 00:07:58,543
You might have 10 minutes before emerging surf photographers.

38
00:07:58,626 --> 00:08:03,089
You can contact Sam Mann Surfer Magazine. He likes the picture ...

39
00:08:03,173 --> 00:08:06,217
- I do not know, but maybe ... - good songs.

40
00:08:09,054 --> 00:08:12,516
Make no see you before me there.

41
00:08:14,434 --> 00:08:18,105
I'm not asking for anything special. I just want a livable wage.

42
00:08:18,188 --> 00:08:23,444
Why do we employ them? They will not succeed.

43
00:08:23,527 --> 00:08:29,033
It is okay. better we employ people at the regular price.

44
00:08:29,116 --> 00:08:32,411
Until then I have to protect the company - you know it.

45
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:35,915
Jim.

46
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:42,255
- I lost my home .... - I could lose my good.

47
00:08:42,338 --> 00:08:46,509
- Which of them? You've got five. - It's late, Trick.

48
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:51,473
Enjoy your spare time. In addition, a good wave in the street. I love you.

49
00:08:53,725 --> 00:08:57,187
Fuck him. It is still the beach for.

50
00:08:57,271 --> 00:09:00,274
You will help Kevy to pay the bills?

51
00:09:02,651 --> 00:09:05,154
Come on.

52
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:13,538
- What are you doing here? - How are you, Trick?

53
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:16,582
- Are you not in the north where the money is? - Where's Ben?

54
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,168
- Upstairs at Jalama. - Jalama?

55
00:09:19,252 --> 00:09:22,839
- Although I have to work. - Thank you.

56
00:09:26,176 --> 00:09:30,722
- How are you? Let us high. - Yes.

57
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,184
Kevy, hastily. There he is.

58
00:09:37,729 --> 00:09:43,569
- Should I do it for you? - I know what I'm doing. Silence.

59
00:09:43,652 --> 00:09:52,245
- Look. I got it the other day. - Good. Right either.

60
00:09:52,328 --> 00:09:55,206
- There he is. - No.

61
00:09:56,582 --> 00:10:00,336
- What? - Wait a wave.

62
00:10:01,421 --> 00:10:05,675
So he came there, doing and turned around.

63
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:08,678
- Kevy. - Photo, aku mengerti.

64
00:10:11,765 --> 00:10:15,268
- Good. - You can swear.

65
00:10:17,437 --> 00:10:21,400
- Dirt, which Ben! - Hell, you missed him.

66
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:25,905
- Trick, asshole. - Too late, motherfuckers.

67
00:10:28,491 --> 00:10:32,870
- There it is. - Evy, the beach takes care of itself.

68
00:10:32,954 --> 00:10:34,372
- Want one? - No.

69
00:10:34,622 --> 00:10:37,166
Buy a bottle of bubbles, but radiology extended.

70
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,502
We share here. It is pure gold.

71
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:42,172
- So valuable, Kevy. - No, you can take it anywhere.

72
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:46,343
- Attitude stillborn. - The waves come tomorrow too.

73
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:50,263
- Meanwhile ... - Where?

74
00:10:52,682 --> 00:10:55,227
- Martys house will be demolished. - You do not have to go there, Trick.

75
00:10:55,477 --> 00:10:59,356
- I'm not going to miss the party. - Stay away from trouble.

76
00:11:00,357 --> 00:11:04,904
- We go! We go! - Cecil! Do not forget your skateboard.

77
00:11:04,987 --> 00:11:09,450
- This is not mine. - Ok, I sell them online.

78
00:11:23,756 --> 00:11:29,137
- Here. - Think about the installment of the mine detector?

79
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:33,475
Then they said, "Surely you can afford it." I have no problem with it, -

80
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:38,897
- But once the house is now worth 850,000 dollars and possibly 4000.

81
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:42,526
Fire! They made me, I guess.

82
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:47,948
But you know what? Do they have a home so they can get it!

83
00:11:48,032 --> 00:11:48,991
Exactly!

84
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:56,290
I love this place. John, wait! I'll take care of it.

85
00:11:57,542 --> 00:12:01,296
It took three weeks to set up the dirt.

86
00:12:02,714 --> 00:12:04,591
Look at this.

87
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:11,348
That is all!

88
00:12:17,062 --> 00:12:20,274
- I board here destroyed. - Dirt.

89
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:25,654
- Only exist? - Yes, how many do you think?

90
00:12:28,032 --> 00:12:33,871
$ -40. -40? I have 40 bags here.

91
00:12:35,248 --> 00:12:40,003
Always. It smells good.

92
00:12:40,086 --> 00:12:45,717
- When can I pick it up? - I have a lot to do now.

93
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:51,765
- It might help. - You know what? Your first line.

94
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:54,601
We'll see.

95
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,730
- When was the same story again. - Mom wants everyone to see it.

96
00:13:38,814 --> 00:13:41,608
No, that's just me.

97
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,866
Hi, honey. No surfing?

98
00:13:57,667 --> 00:14:01,170
Wow.

99
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:06,009
Is Gerry? Some earn money somehow.

100
00:14:09,638 --> 00:14:13,809
- This is all I have. - Come on, you got it in two competitions.

101
00:14:13,892 --> 00:14:18,272
- Sometimes I want to surf without the crowds. - I understand.

102
00:14:18,355 --> 00:14:24,486
- You want to surf, make money ... - No, I want to surf when I want ...

103
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,657
-... With no one watching. - But if no one is watching, it has not happened.

104
00:14:30,534 --> 00:14:35,581
- Go to hell. - Come on, just two thousand.

105
00:14:35,665 --> 00:14:38,334
That's all I have.

106
00:14:40,003 --> 00:14:44,883
- He will go to the Maldives. - Nothing is heard about him there.

107
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:50,096
I had to smoke this up, it's good.

108
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:56,603
Damn! I never get out of this cage.

109
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,565
You will be out on tour again. That is what you are good at.

110
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:04,778
There, please do. I do not see you go around the world.

111
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:08,616
I do not like you. I do not surf all the waves, only my own.

112
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:13,287
You are not ready for when you arrive.

113
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:17,667
I'll go with you if that is what is needed.

114
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,629
- And do what? - I do not know. Everything you hate.

115
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:25,049
Pisse sponsoring down your spine pain ,, clean, real against the judge.

116
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:30,305
And when we go bankrupt? It is rigged. It is industrial and not waves.

117
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:35,686
Ben, we're all broke. We should go from here.

118
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:41,608
- Is that Donna? - Looks like.

119
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:46,530
- Who is he doing? - You let him go, remember?

120
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:48,866
- Ben ... - Protect me.

121
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:52,954
Ben! To hell! Ben!

122
00:15:53,037 --> 00:15:58,584
- You just left me there with him. - Donna, what the heck!

123
00:15:58,668 --> 00:16:04,591
God, Ben. I do not anymore. John, finally.

124
00:16:04,674 --> 00:16:08,345
- Relax. - Did he tell you wet?

125
00:16:08,428 --> 00:16:11,890
Go to hell! John, he'll kill you.

126
00:16:11,973 --> 00:16:14,726
Relax. Come on.

127
00:16:16,228 --> 00:16:18,939
Tuhan, Ben...

128
00:16:19,022 --> 00:16:22,693
You're dead, John. He has friends. Leave me!

129
00:16:27,615 --> 00:16:30,951
Shit. My God, it went well?

130
00:16:31,035 --> 00:16:35,873
- Do not touch me. - I can get you wet. Come here.

131
00:16:35,957 --> 00:16:41,004
- Are you wet now? I love you! - Stop lying.

132
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:45,925
- Lying me? - Ben, set me up. What are you doing?

133
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:50,305
- I love you. - Yes, on Friday, but not on Sundays.

134
00:16:50,388 --> 00:16:53,934
- No, I love you always. - You like the others.

135
00:16:55,769 --> 00:16:58,730
- I miss you. - Do not say like that.

136
00:16:58,814 --> 00:17:01,734
I got over you, let me not put me stuck here again.

137
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:04,987
- Just drop me a bit. - No, I told the father that.

138
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:10,201
What should he do? Fuck! When he returned from Iraq, we were married.

139
00:17:10,284 --> 00:17:12,745
- Married? - Yes, damn.

140
00:17:16,123 --> 00:17:18,501
- Say it. - I love you.

141
00:17:18,584 --> 00:17:21,921
- No, says you have to get married. - I will marry you.

142
00:17:22,005 --> 00:17:25,133
- Are you serious? - I swear, I love you.

143
00:17:29,888 --> 00:17:34,559
God ... Come here, baby.

144
00:17:42,901 --> 00:17:45,779
I love you so much.

145
00:17:45,863 --> 00:17:50,951
Are you okay? Whoa. Where did you learn to fight? In Malibu?

146
00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:56,457
- When someone beats you have to block. - The battle is always in its place?

147
00:17:56,541 --> 00:18:02,630
- They've been together since they were little. - Donna, is that ok?

148
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:08,845
Quiet, he took her home. I do you. He was a disaster.

149
00:18:09,804 --> 00:18:13,892
- He was my boyfriend. - She was the girlfriend of everyone.

150
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:20,065
That's what I mean. When you turn, you have to mean it.

151
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:23,235
- Go to hell. - I'm just trying to help you, ok?

152
00:18:23,318 --> 00:18:26,196
Will you beach minutes, should be the rule.

153
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,116
- This is not your beach. - Yes, that's it.

154
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,662
Whether it is water, it is mine. Do inland, the pipe.

155
00:18:33,788 --> 00:18:37,917
Cause he saw it, he was already dead.

156
00:18:39,544 --> 00:18:42,755
Carrying weapons, for you can not fight.

157
00:18:47,177 --> 00:18:53,350
- Dad will love Donnas. - Yes, if he comes home from Iraq.

158
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:56,687
If you are going to get along with the tour, had to leave all of this.

159
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:02,943
Forget it. Everyone is in need of repair. "Johnnys mobile board repair."

160
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:06,906
- You know the one in which Mexico? - Yes.

161
00:19:07,823 --> 00:19:12,411
- He belonged to a gang, El Rio Locos. - He does not fight like that.

162
00:19:12,495 --> 00:19:15,164
- But he wears the colors. - And?

163
00:19:15,248 --> 00:19:19,711
Did they kill you for a girl who had been taken?

164
00:19:19,794 --> 00:19:24,924
No ... I just borrowed it. She could have him.

165
00:19:36,186 --> 00:19:41,066
What do you do with it?

166
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:44,153
Will you play a member of the gang now?

167
00:19:44,903 --> 00:19:48,991
- What? - I think you want to get out of here.

168
00:19:49,074 --> 00:19:54,372
Jo. But now I do not know where it is.

169
00:19:55,998 --> 00:19:58,042
It is not ok.

170
00:20:00,837 --> 00:20:05,341
Tell Donna that I have benefited to Wainini if ​​he rings.

171
00:20:05,425 --> 00:20:08,261
What happened there?

172
00:20:51,598 --> 00:20:54,351
What?

173
00:21:04,486 --> 00:21:08,407
Benny Boy! It is time to stand up, ladies.

174
00:21:08,657 --> 00:21:14,205
- What is wrong with you? Come on! - Shit. This is the case, it's up to you.

175
00:21:16,332 --> 00:21:20,420
- What have you? - Dad!

176
00:21:20,503 --> 00:21:26,009
- This is a double gubbe there. - Please, tell me she was 18.

177
00:21:26,092 --> 00:21:28,136
Shit.

178
00:22:45,383 --> 00:22:49,387
We need to revive that way, see.

179
00:22:49,471 --> 00:22:52,307
We need to revive it.

180
00:22:57,396 --> 00:23:02,276
Is not he a little old to be playing with a hoop?

181
00:23:03,485 --> 00:23:07,072
- Think about her father seeing him now. - Say something.

182
00:23:07,156 --> 00:23:12,328
He will not listen to me. My mother, not the father.

183
00:23:12,411 --> 00:23:15,206
You little bastard.

184
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:21,337
Hey Jeanette. Apa kabar?

185
00:23:21,421 --> 00:23:23,715
- Hey taxes. - Can I tell the mother what?

186
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:28,386
- Tell me what? - Mamma. We're getting married.

187
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,226
- Ben, you change ever. - Come on, he loves her.

188
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:40,274
- Ben, you hang well with Jeanette? - What?

189
00:23:40,357 --> 00:23:45,321
- No, that's not true. - He married me. Really?

190
00:23:45,404 --> 00:23:50,409
Donna, sharpen. Ben, when did you do?

191
00:23:50,493 --> 00:23:57,750
- About four or five years. - You'll end up like a naughty girl.

192
00:23:57,834 --> 00:24:01,754
- What is needed in one to know one. - Three months and 14 days.

193
00:24:01,838 --> 00:24:04,883
- So we look at how you talk to me. - Dad comes home ...

194
00:24:04,966 --> 00:24:10,180
... But then he was back then. Why he will not be with you?

195
00:24:10,263 --> 00:24:13,225
Where you sleep tonight? For you do not sleep in my house.

196
00:24:13,308 --> 00:24:21,024
Hell! You're kidding? It's ok, I have everything spot.

197
00:24:21,108 --> 00:24:26,238
- Here, taste. - Hey, you in the parking lot?

198
00:24:27,156 --> 00:24:30,659
Okay, come and get me. I will call back. Yes, hurry up.

199
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:35,498
Wait! Donna!

200
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:47,260
- Woman! - Tunggu, Donna.

201
00:24:50,263 --> 00:24:53,642
- Donna, wait! - Go to hell!

202
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:57,104
Donna, come here. What is wrong with you?

203
00:25:00,274 --> 00:25:02,442
Go to hell!

204
00:25:03,986 --> 00:25:07,072
- Fuck her. - Yes, give me a beer.

205
00:25:10,868 --> 00:25:17,500
Whether to fix a drink, so drink it himself.

206
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:20,128
God, I'm sorry.

207
00:26:06,134 --> 00:26:08,428
Ben!

208
00:26:09,387 --> 00:26:13,433
Do you go to Magoo? Ronnie says that he can bring us to the bottom.

209
00:26:15,393 --> 00:26:17,396
It's better than this crap.

210
00:26:19,982 --> 00:26:22,151
Ben!

211
00:26:23,652 --> 00:26:26,697
Are you sleeping? Ben?

212
00:26:29,325 --> 00:26:31,327
Ben!

213
00:26:32,578 --> 00:26:36,415
Ben? Ben, bangun!

214
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:39,836
Ben!

215
00:26:41,671 --> 00:26:45,425
Help! You there, call the emergency services!

216
00:27:04,528 --> 00:27:07,489
- Your Move. - Sorry.

217
00:27:10,784 --> 00:27:13,954
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight ...

218
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:16,999
- You worked well, children. - To the left.

219
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:20,920
- Eight, nine, ten ... - You have been known to be here during the quarter.

220
00:27:21,003 --> 00:27:24,257
- Are you getting bored? - No.

221
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:29,429
- Can we try? - You certainly do not give up?

222
00:27:29,512 --> 00:27:33,183
- We will do everything we can. - Okay.

223
00:27:35,977 --> 00:27:38,814
Passed! One two three ...

224
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,238
Once again.

225
00:27:50,826 --> 00:27:59,460
End. Well, you do well again? This is Ben. Kind, just once.

226
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:08,595
Once again, please! Again ... Please ...

227
00:30:04,966 --> 00:30:09,929
John? John, menunggu.

228
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,518
Take this.

229
00:30:54,267 --> 00:30:56,520
Rest in peace, brother.

230
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:22,088
We are all dead now. Not only is Ben.

231
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:48,657
- What is this? - This is the other side of the power plant.

232
00:32:00,795 --> 00:32:04,590
- Sorry to interrupt again. - Do detective again?

233
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:08,928
- Where are you when you are needed? - Dad, let him do his job.

234
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:12,474
- I have some questions. - Come

235
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:15,685
I'll talk with John .. Join if you want.

236
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:21,733
- It could swear, it was my home. - We have three murders ...

237
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:25,863
... Only in El Rio. All had been killed with a shot in the head like Ben.

238
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:28,699
Damn Mexican gangs.

239
00:32:32,161 --> 00:32:34,955
- Want something to drink? - No, thank you.

240
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,042
- Should Ben relation to El Rio Locos? - No.

241
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:40,711
- Is your lawn? - Not them.

242
00:32:40,795 --> 00:32:43,840
- My son smoke no grass. - Mom, she blows the grass.

243
00:32:43,923 --> 00:32:50,680
- Our son is in all the pictures, see. - And the green Honda Civic?

244
00:32:50,764 --> 00:32:55,101
- Do you remember the registration number? - No, I think not even on it.

245
00:32:55,185 --> 00:32:59,398
- Just talk to Donna. - He does not know his last name.

246
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:02,651
He knew he was definitely not good. They met on the beach.

247
00:33:02,901 --> 00:33:05,487
- This is nonsense. - Calm down, we spoke with Donna.

248
00:33:05,571 --> 00:33:09,783
No, you do not. Not while the investigation is ongoing. Understand?

249
00:33:09,867 --> 00:33:17,583
- Ok, you have the names and the car. - You know how much the Civic here?

250
00:33:17,667 --> 00:33:22,296
What are you talking about? With the technology, satellite and dirt ...

251
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,967
- You can not find the damn car ?! - Yes we can.

252
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:30,638
But we have a plat or last name would help.

253
00:33:30,722 --> 00:33:34,643
How much work on this? Only you, huh?

254
00:33:34,726 --> 00:33:38,897
- I get help detectives. - And what have you done? Nothing?

255
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,608
I was fired I did not do anything.

256
00:33:41,692 --> 00:33:47,156
John, call me if you think of something. We will solve this.

257
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:52,077
- When? Next month? Next year? - As soon as we know anything, we'll call.

258
00:33:52,161 --> 00:33:54,622
I regret the loss.

259
00:33:56,165 --> 00:33:57,875
No chance that I wait one year!

260
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:32,828
- Johnny! Johnny!
- Apa?

261
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:38,960
You need to shine. Your father talked about killing children of Mexico.

262
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:41,003
He spoke to everyone about it.

263
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:52,724
- Are you okay? - Relax. Healey broke the drought.

264
00:34:54,851 --> 00:34:58,730
Are you kidding, Gloomy? Thursday, two years ago.

265
00:34:58,814 --> 00:35:01,900
- Do you not think I say that? - Dad does not drink, he drowned.

266
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:14,038
He said he would go home and grab a gun and shot Miguel.

267
00:35:14,288 --> 00:35:16,916
Do you have a weapon?

268
00:35:18,876 --> 00:35:20,795
Dad?

269
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,924
What are you doing with my gun?

270
00:35:26,134 --> 00:35:28,386
You know what we should do.

271
00:35:31,306 --> 00:35:33,600
- Mamma. - He was full. This ends now.

272
00:35:33,683 --> 00:35:37,938
It is ok, you're afraid. Do not worry, this is the case.

273
00:35:38,021 --> 00:35:41,942
- This is not right, Dad. - You know what? Wish I was there ...

274
00:35:43,485 --> 00:35:45,904
... I do not stand with hands in his pockets while my brother died.

275
00:35:45,988 --> 00:35:51,827
- I Asked always to Ben. - Ben needed no one did.

276
00:35:51,911 --> 00:35:56,499
- No, he was the golden boy. - What's wrong with you ?!

277
00:35:56,582 --> 00:36:00,920
He is dead, and you're still jealous.

278
00:36:01,003 --> 00:36:01,754
That is not true.

279
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,759
Daddy, stop! Please stop!

280
00:36:08,928 --> 00:36:14,142
You never can take advantage of the problem page. Like when a big wave came.

281
00:36:14,225 --> 00:36:21,024
What are you doing? You give it. You have no backbone. You do not have the ball.

282
00:36:22,776 --> 00:36:26,989
- I have. - Do You?

283
00:36:28,782 --> 00:36:32,119
- I'm going to kill that bastard. - You just said a full bar there.

284
00:36:32,203 --> 00:36:36,791
- My friends do not know. - Grim could not close his mouth.

285
00:36:36,874 --> 00:36:41,045
- To hell with Bleak! - You can not solve anything.

286
00:36:41,129 --> 00:36:44,090
- It is not even drunk. - You ...

287
00:36:45,466 --> 00:36:49,888
You have to come with me because I was all you got. And You ...

288
00:36:49,971 --> 00:36:53,516
How often went to the store and see pictures brother

289
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,145
- In any surfing magazine checkouts?

290
00:36:57,229 --> 00:37:04,945
I went there this morning and there she was. And I bought every magazine.

291
00:37:06,447 --> 00:37:09,241
Do you know why, John?

292
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:13,162
For it will never happen again.

293
00:37:16,415 --> 00:37:19,961
You have a tomb to cry.

294
00:37:20,044 --> 00:37:22,130
Do you want one spit on, too?

295
00:37:25,675 --> 00:37:32,766
- John. - Good. If that is what you want, Dad.

296
00:37:34,309 --> 00:37:38,814
Okay, I'll do it. I do it if that's what you want.

297
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:46,238
See? He must be a man.

298
00:37:46,321 --> 00:37:50,242
You later, Mom? Is that what you want?

299
00:37:56,499 --> 00:37:58,793
Eye for an eye.

300
00:38:06,676 --> 00:38:09,888
Why did you do that?

301
00:38:09,971 --> 00:38:14,184
You buried your brother, to the prize. You have to bury the bodies.

302
00:38:14,267 --> 00:38:21,566
I still believe that my son's life. Tell me what's behind all the sand.

303
00:38:23,151 --> 00:38:25,404
I can only show.

304
00:38:40,169 --> 00:38:42,338
Are you crying yet?

305
00:38:47,176 --> 00:38:49,220
Just as I browse.

306
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,605
- Is this for my father? - Yes.

307
00:38:59,731 --> 00:39:02,442
He called us.

308
00:39:04,486 --> 00:39:09,158
- Does my father called? - Yes, he was talking with my dad for a while.

309
00:39:09,241 --> 00:39:13,287
He could not say where she was.

310
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:17,750
- He did not call me. - Donna, it may not be time.

311
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:20,378
Father sent an e-mail.

312
00:39:21,796 --> 00:39:26,175
"Sorry Dear." That's all she wrote.

313
00:39:31,014 --> 00:39:34,643
I think that he was sorry for that he could not come to the funeral.

314
00:39:42,943 --> 00:39:47,281
- How to Miguel there? - Do not know.

315
00:39:47,531 --> 00:39:51,327
Do not lie. I know that you did not tell the police everything.

316
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:55,331
No, I do not. I say nothing.

317
00:39:56,332 --> 00:39:59,293
Miguel ring and say that you will meet.

318
00:40:01,295 --> 00:40:07,510
God ... So stupid of me.

319
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:12,307
I think that at least you'll give me a hug or something?

320
00:40:12,557 --> 00:40:16,311
Donna, I will.

321
00:40:16,394 --> 00:40:20,273
- No - John, I've seen your eyes.

322
00:40:21,191 --> 00:40:25,821
You love me. You always love me. Ben has been told.

323
00:40:26,113 --> 00:40:29,533
He said you were going to ask me out before he did.

324
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:33,579
- This is not true. - Want to see my body?

325
00:40:33,662 --> 00:40:39,126
Donna, stop! Your including Ben. You will always be his.

326
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:47,218
- This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. - We are friends. Just friends.

327
00:40:48,511 --> 00:40:52,724
You know, you're not so tough. You'll fit you.

328
00:40:55,310 --> 00:41:03,151
John ... you're just afraid to be in love with me and get your heart broken.

329
00:41:04,903 --> 00:41:08,532
That's why you do not have no boyfriend. You scared.

330
00:41:08,615 --> 00:41:13,621
- You are not alone now, Donna. - I'm not ashamed of who I am.

331
00:41:17,249 --> 00:41:20,419
I can touch you.

332
00:41:22,672 --> 00:41:28,094
I could turn it off. But you certainly can not.

333
00:41:30,472 --> 00:41:33,266
That's why you never touch anyone.

334
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:40,440
My way is better, so ... Call me if you want to know.

335
00:42:20,524 --> 00:42:22,651
What happened?

336
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:28,240
It was the best I'd ever surfedag.

337
00:42:29,575 --> 00:42:33,537
A day like this you forget everything.

338
00:42:34,663 --> 00:42:38,626
I would not kill anyone. Not that day.

339
00:42:41,337 --> 00:42:44,006
I would only be in the water.

340
00:43:03,694 --> 00:43:06,822
Beautiful waves today, Mom.

341
00:43:29,888 --> 00:43:34,100
I think that we can call the detective and told about Miguel.

342
00:43:36,603 --> 00:43:39,022
Then he will be arrested.

343
00:43:42,859 --> 00:43:44,778
The ...

344
00:43:47,781 --> 00:43:52,161
- And she was released on bail. - Yes.

345
00:43:52,244 --> 00:43:57,333
So want to go to Mexico, for that is what they do.

346
00:43:57,416 --> 00:44:00,002
No crime zone.

347
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:21,066
John. What happened, my brother?

348
00:44:21,149 --> 00:44:25,946
- Morning. - Council? Rincon tomorrow pump.

349
00:44:26,029 --> 00:44:31,452
- Yes. Here. - Good.

350
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:34,246
- Thanks, man. - Does not matter.

351
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:39,210
- Do you speak something about your cousin? - Transfer Listing every other Sunday.

352
00:44:41,003 --> 00:44:45,842
- If you ask how it is to sit in? - No waves.

353
00:44:47,343 --> 00:44:51,306
So you are planning to take advantage of it?

354
00:44:53,558 --> 00:44:56,269
- No ... - Do not be taken.

355
00:44:57,354 --> 00:45:02,693
Either way it's not so bad. He took the high school there.

356
00:45:03,777 --> 00:45:06,697
They have scholarships.

357
00:45:26,009 --> 00:45:30,847
I think you might use it again if I washed.

358
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:35,268
- But it does not. - Mom ...

359
00:45:35,352 --> 00:45:39,022
- Give me your shirt. - I'm going to cry, but ...

360
00:45:39,731 --> 00:45:46,780
... I was not able to finish. I would wake up and realize that it is more.

361
00:45:55,664 --> 00:45:57,458
I love you.

362
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:15,936
"I do not belong."

363
00:46:30,743 --> 00:46:35,748
- What the hell do you want? - Wash Mom t-jersey I got ...

364
00:46:35,831 --> 00:46:40,711
... When I find Ben. There was blood on the kitchen floor.

365
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:49,053
Dave has utility in the house.

366
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:53,433
This empty.

367
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:05,571
Wow.

368
00:47:25,007 --> 00:47:27,719
It may be too low.

369
00:47:36,978 --> 00:47:39,648
Do I get it? Thank you.

370
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:49,742
Here then? What are you thinking?

371
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,956
What are you talking about?

372
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:59,085
You know that.

373
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:08,511
It is probably too high. I do not want to fall.

374
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,536
Then here we go again.

375
00:48:38,584 --> 00:48:41,379
There is a disk.

376
00:48:42,088 --> 00:48:44,841
It is always a good choice.

377
00:48:46,092 --> 00:48:48,136
What do you think?

378
00:48:51,556 --> 00:48:54,017
I think so.

379
00:48:57,062 --> 00:48:58,897
It might be our best option.

380
00:49:01,316 --> 00:49:06,738
- What? - There is a lot to take in

381
00:49:06,822 --> 00:49:10,784
I love myself ..

382
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:16,624
- I do not know what this means. - Yeah, so are you.

383
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:20,795
- It is sick. - It is okay.

384
00:49:21,837 --> 00:49:25,633
- I see when you look at me and Ben. - What?

385
00:49:27,468 --> 00:49:30,930
When you are in a garage on the couch.

386
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:37,145
We were with each other, and you stand there and then fight a long time.

387
00:49:37,228 --> 00:49:42,401
- I have to go now. - Do not go.

388
00:49:47,072 --> 00:49:49,658
I loved it.

389
00:49:51,702 --> 00:49:57,792
I like that you see us. I know do not know how to explain it.

390
00:49:59,752 --> 00:50:06,884
But for the first time for a long time ...

391
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:12,390
... I feel like is not used.

392
00:50:49,637 --> 00:50:52,140
God ...

393
00:50:57,062 --> 00:50:59,731
god ...

394
00:51:01,775 --> 00:51:07,114
There are so many empty houses. Where is everyone?

395
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:12,953
- Inland. - I have to stay at sea.

396
00:51:16,415 --> 00:51:21,045
- Will I see you tomorrow? - If you call him?

397
00:51:22,046 --> 00:51:24,382
Who?

398
00:51:25,675 --> 00:51:29,512
God, Miguel? Is that what this is about?

399
00:51:29,596 --> 00:51:36,186
- Say that you will meet on the beach. - It is not that.

400
00:51:36,269 --> 00:51:39,689
Yes, you can. You can get that at any time to do anything.

401
00:51:39,814 --> 00:51:43,944
- Not her. Do it now. - Donna, she killed my brother!

402
00:51:44,027 --> 00:51:49,032
Did he really say that?

403
00:51:49,116 --> 00:51:52,244
Let's just say you want to meet him in the parking lot noon.

404
00:51:52,328 --> 00:51:54,955
So you stay away.

405
00:51:58,584 --> 00:52:02,380
- What are you doing to me? - What do you want.

406
00:52:07,051 --> 00:52:10,054
- Did you bring me? - Yes.

407
00:52:10,138 --> 00:52:14,392
- How long? - As long as you want.

408
00:52:24,194 --> 00:52:27,114
Dad. Dinner is ready.

409
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:31,118
No steak.

410
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:39,877
Duduklah, John.

411
00:52:49,304 --> 00:52:51,890
You can not kill him.

412
00:52:53,475 --> 00:52:56,561
- Surely you know? - Yes.

413
00:52:58,188 --> 00:53:01,441
- I know it. - Anything I say, I ...

414
00:53:03,443 --> 00:53:08,031
I do not mean it. It was just talk, I do not mean it.

415
00:53:08,866 --> 00:53:11,118
I love you, Daddy.

416
00:53:15,998 --> 00:53:20,211
You are better than all of this, John. You are a good boy.

417
00:53:22,296 --> 00:53:27,719
I think we could ledge brother by opening the surf school.

418
00:53:29,178 --> 00:53:37,771
Ben Pipers surf school. We can get the kids out of town and teach them about the sea.

419
00:53:39,773 --> 00:53:42,192
- Here? - No.

420
00:53:43,235 --> 00:53:46,655
Malibu or south where it's safe.

421
00:53:48,323 --> 00:53:51,744
It is a good idea, Dad.

422
00:53:51,827 --> 00:53:54,371
Ben had quite liked it.

423
00:53:57,416 --> 00:54:01,087
What are you saying? What did you say?

424
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:06,008
Wow, forget it.

425
00:54:38,334 --> 00:54:43,256
It is frightening how easy it is to kill someone.

426
00:54:45,091 --> 00:54:48,970
There you will find ... when you're doing.

427
00:54:50,638 --> 00:54:52,640
When the ball over my head.

428
00:54:52,724 --> 00:54:54,476
How are you?

429
00:54:54,726 --> 00:54:58,146
Wait and see. It was nothing, really.

430
00:56:03,631 --> 00:56:06,134
Mom, what happened?

431
00:56:08,344 --> 00:56:11,139
They come ... Donna and I.

432
00:56:13,391 --> 00:56:18,605
- Who? Is this Dad? - There is no danger.

433
00:56:20,315 --> 00:56:22,025
Why do you have a weapon?

434
00:56:25,779 --> 00:56:29,074
We solved it. I took care of it.

435
00:56:29,158 --> 00:56:32,244
- What do you mean? - That I shot Miguel.

436
00:56:35,372 --> 00:56:38,167
- Where? - In the parking lot.

437
00:56:39,502 --> 00:56:42,630
- Is he dead? - Yes.

438
00:56:44,507 --> 00:56:48,052
I do not think I would be that, but I just.

439
00:56:50,013 --> 00:56:52,307
Where is the father?

440
00:56:53,892 --> 00:56:57,062
- Poker di Scotty.
- Baik.

441
00:56:57,145 --> 00:57:02,400
- I must say that before I signed. - No, not the police.

442
00:57:02,484 --> 00:57:07,447
- Yes, Mom. Police. - No, I will not be in jail.

443
00:57:07,531 --> 00:57:12,453
- I have lost one of you. - I must.

444
00:57:12,536 --> 00:57:16,624
- Why? So someone in there? - Yes Ma'am. I saw it.

445
00:57:17,583 --> 00:57:19,376
I see it.

446
00:57:21,295 --> 00:57:28,469
It is ok. You can cry now, Mom. You can cry.

447
00:57:30,388 --> 00:57:34,768
Ben can rest in peace now. That may be what you want?

448
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,661
Okay! Good!

449
00:57:54,246 --> 00:58:00,002
It's never good enough. You know what? Most proud Dad.

450
00:58:00,086 --> 00:58:03,881
- Donna attempted suicide today. - What?

451
00:58:03,965 --> 00:58:10,430
Vicky found the diary, they quarreled and he was found bleeding on the floor.

452
00:58:10,513 --> 00:58:14,934
- Is he okay? - No, obviously she did not have it.

453
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:25,445
Listen. You can clear this before talking to Dad?

454
00:58:27,948 --> 00:58:32,411
- Yes, mother ... - I'm worried about Donna and me ...

455
00:58:32,661 --> 00:58:37,291
-... Will go. I understand? - Yes, just seared.

456
00:59:14,413 --> 00:59:20,294
- Vicky! Let me in! - Sorry.

457
00:59:21,671 --> 00:59:23,756
What are you doing?

458
00:59:28,428 --> 00:59:32,390
- I want no more children. - Run fast if you do not want Åke into.

459
00:59:32,473 --> 00:59:36,728
- One can be inseminated. - Just run, Vicky.

460
00:59:36,811 --> 00:59:40,190
- I can have more children. - No, you can not ...

461
00:59:41,858 --> 00:59:47,906
You are a terrible mother. As bad as I do.

462
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:52,494
Is It True? You are never more than Ben. It never felt better.

463
00:59:52,578 --> 00:59:55,581
You just have to deal with it.

464
00:59:56,790 --> 01:00:00,669
- Why? - Because there is no cure without scars.

465
01:00:00,753 --> 01:00:08,970
It was all of us. Two old scars to fat for our old jeans.

466
01:00:09,053 --> 01:00:13,892
- We have all been killed Donna. - That we did together.

467
01:00:32,828 --> 01:00:34,788
Mom!

468
01:00:46,717 --> 01:00:51,014
- Mom! Dad! - Let him remain conscious for the first.

469
01:00:51,097 --> 01:00:53,725
- I am calm. - Why did you hit me?

470
01:00:53,808 --> 01:00:56,603
Sit down.

471
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:58,730
What are you doing here?

472
01:01:00,106 --> 01:01:02,275
Fast, Vicky.

473
01:01:03,485 --> 01:01:07,531
- What the ... - He does not get into the house.

474
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:14,496
But then he hit like if someone were to replace him.

475
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:18,000
- He's going to kill himself, so ... - Tonight?

476
01:01:18,083 --> 01:01:22,922
- No... Juli 4.
- No

477
01:01:24,048 --> 01:01:26,259
Fast, Vicky.

478
01:01:26,342 --> 01:01:33,558
He went to the beach, but then came Ben up full.

479
01:01:34,851 --> 01:01:41,608
He laughed and teased and sang "This is where the bride dressed in white."

480
01:01:41,691 --> 01:01:45,028
You know how fucking nasty he can be when he is drunk.

481
01:01:45,112 --> 01:01:48,699
Do not blame it on Ben.

482
01:01:48,782 --> 01:01:52,453
He will not kill him. It was an accident.

483
01:01:52,536 --> 01:01:55,664
He sifted and weapons away.

484
01:01:57,374 --> 01:02:00,544
You said you saw. That you see Miguel shot.

485
01:02:00,628 --> 01:02:05,049
- I see him go. - It's not the same, John.

486
01:02:05,132 --> 01:02:09,762
What is the difference? We kept it in the family.

487
01:02:09,846 --> 01:02:15,393
- I'll call the police. - You did it, I cried assault.

488
01:02:15,477 --> 01:02:21,066
- We do it my way, Trick. - Dad, I shot the wrong person.

489
01:02:21,149 --> 01:02:29,741
There is no danger, John. I finished it. I just need to be more aware.

490
01:02:29,825 --> 01:02:34,747
I took care of arms and body. We do not need the police.

491
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:38,292
Vicky and I did it together to save our children, -

492
01:02:38,417 --> 01:02:42,088
- So please remember that we keep this between us.

493
01:02:42,171 --> 01:02:47,218
Do not include me in the "we". I have nothing to do with this.

494
01:02:47,301 --> 01:02:52,515
I killed him ... I killed him without further ado.

495
01:02:53,474 --> 01:02:56,895
- Where is Donna? - He's not here.

496
01:02:56,978 --> 01:02:59,356
- This is nonsense. - He is not here!

497
01:02:59,606 --> 01:03:02,776
John! John, kembali! Neraka!

498
01:03:38,146 --> 01:03:41,316
- I'm going to grow hibiscus. - Where is the body?

499
01:03:41,399 --> 01:03:43,985
Where was never found.

500
01:03:44,069 --> 01:03:49,908
Have you thought about the river? All flushed up sooner or later.

501
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:56,206
- But then too late. - You know what I would say.

502
01:03:58,083 --> 01:04:03,839
When they catch you, John. Me too, and Donna and Vicky.

503
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:08,928
Maybe your father too. So just call.

504
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:17,062
Please, John. And when his mother would have spit on the grave ...

505
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:23,026
- I would not blame him. - No, I killed the wrong man.

506
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:25,821
And everything else is just a bonus.

507
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:31,702
It happens to us all sooner or later. Welcome to the club.

508
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:33,871
You'll get over it.

509
01:04:48,177 --> 01:04:54,767
Sorry, Dad. I'm not going to affect not, but I surrendered.

510
01:05:00,649 --> 01:05:02,859
It is the right thing.

511
01:05:04,736 --> 01:05:06,989
It takes balls.

512
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:12,327
I hope that you got them from me.

513
01:05:16,206 --> 01:05:17,917
I will refresh me.

514
01:05:25,883 --> 01:05:32,307
I have been long enough to know that changes one's life forever.

515
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:51,201
This is not what I want for you, but that's all it was.

516
01:05:58,083 --> 01:06:05,299
The police did not come after you here. While you can learn something.

517
01:06:32,327 --> 01:06:35,039
Donna sent a letter to me.

518
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:41,212
I'm not a hero. I was just there.

519
01:06:54,183 --> 01:06:56,060
I do not see a lot of wars.

520
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:06,363
Honestly ... I saw everything.

521
01:08:29,283 --> 01:08:32,953
Donna sent my diary before he killed himself.

522
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:39,293
I had the same day because they found her dead.

523
01:08:41,837 --> 01:08:47,134
- She is a good girl. - Thank you for coming.

524
01:08:51,305 --> 01:08:53,808
Thank you.

525
01:08:53,891 --> 01:08:56,269
Where is he?

526
01:08:57,645 --> 01:09:01,441
His father home for burial tomorrow.

527
01:09:01,524 --> 01:09:06,238
Eventually I will let her dirty hands as well.

528
01:09:15,205 --> 01:09:20,211
Where is he? Everyone told me that she was a good girl.

529
01:09:20,294 --> 01:09:22,380
Pretend it's true.

530
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:02,129
- Who is it? - I do not know ...

531
01:10:02,213 --> 01:10:05,132
... But Donna liked Mexico.

532
01:10:50,888 --> 01:10:53,016
Hello.

533
01:11:00,815 --> 01:11:05,237
- I hear that your stay with Gerry. - How many bills.

534
01:11:05,487 --> 01:11:08,323
Give me a minute, okay?

535
01:11:09,783 --> 01:11:12,578
I want you to know that you can always go home.

536
01:11:14,037 --> 01:11:16,040
I have no home.

537
01:11:19,793 --> 01:11:23,672
I do not expect that you understand what I'm doing.

538
01:11:23,756 --> 01:11:30,513
Not now, but one day when you have kids. If so, you may call me.

539
01:11:31,764 --> 01:11:37,145
I will be a part of your life. When you come back.

540
01:11:46,488 --> 01:11:48,490
Hey, Dad.

541
01:11:54,872 --> 01:11:59,293
- Hello. How are you? - Good.

542
01:12:00,753 --> 01:12:04,548
- I can take care of their hands. - Good.

543
01:12:04,632 --> 01:12:11,597
- Do you take painkillers for it? - No, I survived.

544
01:12:11,681 --> 01:12:15,101
- Yes, it's probably for the best. - Yes.

545
01:12:16,102 --> 01:12:21,232
I have been aware for 287 days. Almost 10 months.

546
01:12:21,316 --> 01:12:24,402
- Is that true? - Yes.

547
01:12:27,447 --> 01:12:33,412
- Why are not you in Donnas it? - She and her mother ... you know.

548
01:12:34,663 --> 01:12:41,212
- I do not even know my wife. - Miguel's mother was at the funeral.

549
01:12:41,462 --> 01:12:45,633
I'll tell you what happened. I know where he lives, Dad.

550
01:12:45,716 --> 01:12:50,012
- Where? In Mexico? - Malibu.

551
01:12:50,096 --> 01:12:54,601
Donna knew it all along. He wrote in his diary.

552
01:12:56,227 --> 01:13:00,357
- Sounds like you'll be killed. - He deserves to know that, Dad.

553
01:13:04,861 --> 01:13:06,822
Juan, I took off the rest of the day. Should fix something with my son.

554
01:13:06,905 --> 01:13:10,033
- I'll go with you. - No.

555
01:13:10,117 --> 01:13:12,411
- I support you. - I have to solve this problem alone.

556
01:13:19,793 --> 01:13:26,676
I want to tell you that, so you know what I have in store.

557
01:13:32,724 --> 01:13:38,480
Besides ... it must just be a fight.

558
01:13:41,024 --> 01:13:46,196
Do not ask them for forgiveness, then you will not get.

559
01:13:47,322 --> 01:13:54,204
Tell your story and ask them to listen. Do not start with what you have done, -

560
01:13:54,455 --> 01:13:59,335
- Without you and Ben. Tell all about Ben for them.

561
01:13:59,418 --> 01:14:06,968
Tell the whole family. Tell about your mother and father demanding DIN

562
01:14:07,051 --> 01:14:12,140
- Which is a damn drunks who have no use for you.

563
01:14:12,265 --> 01:14:15,977
Do it. Tell the whole story.

564
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:20,648
Then they came to do one of two things.

565
01:14:20,732 --> 01:14:24,986
Do they kill you, or then leave you to the police.

566
01:14:26,363 --> 01:14:27,906
It does not end in any other way.

567
01:14:29,992 --> 01:14:32,786
And the story starts in the water, John.

568
01:15:07,697 --> 01:15:12,327
- Property Rivera. - Hey, I want to talk to Laura Rivera.

569
01:15:12,411 --> 01:15:14,830
He did not receive visitors.

570
01:15:16,331 --> 01:15:19,543
Can you tell him that I saw him at the funeral Donnas.

571
01:15:19,627 --> 01:15:21,504
Moment.

572
01:15:41,274 --> 01:15:44,236
- Go ahead, come in - Thanks ..

573
01:15:44,319 --> 01:15:46,738
She greets you here.

574
01:15:51,618 --> 01:15:54,788
- Do you want something? Mineral water? - No, thank you.

575
01:15:54,872 --> 01:15:58,000
Sit down. Ms. Rivera soon.

576
01:15:58,083 --> 01:16:00,211
Thank you.

577
01:16:11,556 --> 01:16:15,894
- If you make him angry? - No, I will not hurt him.

578
01:16:15,977 --> 01:16:20,857
I know you do not. I asked if it would make him angry.

579
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:23,693
I just ...

580
01:16:26,738 --> 01:16:30,409
- Can I offer you something? - No, thank you.

581
01:16:30,492 --> 01:16:33,036
- You see my funeral certain Donnas. - Yes.

582
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:36,707
- Are you a friend of Donna? - Yes.

583
01:16:37,791 --> 01:16:41,295
I'm sorry, I do not know him well. She is a lovely girl.

584
01:16:41,378 --> 01:16:45,132
- He knew my son. - I know.

585
01:16:45,216 --> 01:16:47,093
Do you know Miguel?

586
01:16:48,928 --> 01:16:50,805
Ya.

587
01:16:53,349 --> 01:16:59,773
He has been gone for almost a year. We have not heard from him. Do You Know?

588
01:17:03,526 --> 01:17:05,570
Ya.

589
01:17:06,613 --> 01:17:08,156
Do you know where he is?

590
01:17:12,202 --> 01:17:18,500
- I know what happened. - Happen? Is he alive?

591
01:17:24,548 --> 01:17:26,634
How do you know?

592
01:17:32,682 --> 01:17:36,227
- I know, but not here. - Please, tell me now.

593
01:17:36,311 --> 01:17:40,148
No ... I have to show you something.

594
01:17:41,066 --> 01:17:44,236
I'll take you there and then informed.

595
01:17:46,029 --> 01:17:48,573
I had to change.

596
01:17:52,911 --> 01:17:55,581
- Does he know anything? - Yes.

597
01:17:55,664 --> 01:17:59,126
- I can get it from him. - No, I'm going with him.

598
01:17:59,209 --> 01:18:02,296
- I joined. - No, I do not know what I should do.

599
01:18:02,379 --> 01:18:08,052
- You do not go with strangers. - Charles, he was not even here.

600
01:18:22,859 --> 01:18:26,071
You are driving. Ms. Rivera sat in the back seat.

601
01:18:40,794 --> 01:18:46,884
Donna did the right thing. She asked her mother to say where the body was.

602
01:18:50,596 --> 01:18:52,682
It is here.

603
01:18:53,433 --> 01:18:57,520
Only when the fence ... that they know that the sand will cause the crowd Up

604
01:18:57,604 --> 01:19:00,690
- And he will be buried.

605
01:19:00,774 --> 01:19:03,443
Set my son buried here?

606
01:19:46,196 --> 01:19:48,740
I ...

607
01:19:50,617 --> 01:19:55,289
You will kill me how you want. Only I could see the sea.

608
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,711
There, look at me.

609
01:20:02,922 --> 01:20:04,924
Look at me!

610
01:20:06,801 --> 01:20:13,683
I want you to know who he is, so you know what you have taken from me.

611
01:20:15,351 --> 01:20:21,316
I'll tell you about the day when he was born, but I was drugged.

612
01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:28,323
I will tell about the first words, but I was in Paris with his glove

613
01:20:28,615 --> 01:20:31,201
- And she with their caregivers.

614
01:20:31,285 --> 01:20:36,039
He played with the children in the street as if he is different from them.

615
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:43,214
I hate to see him play with them.

616
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:49,178
How can I protect him if he can not protect themselves?

617
01:21:01,691 --> 01:21:05,570
- Did you kill her? - Yes.

618
01:21:08,365 --> 01:21:13,745
And mother, and Vicky, too? And left his body to rot in here-

619
01:21:13,829 --> 01:21:21,253
- And dumped his car in the river? Told you to be forgiven?

620
01:21:24,215 --> 01:21:29,845
- I do not know if it's possible. - Tell me what a good day for you.

621
01:21:33,599 --> 01:21:38,021
- What? - I will shoot you as you shoot.

622
01:21:41,232 --> 01:21:46,488
But I will kill you in a better way. I will wait for a good day.

623
01:21:46,571 --> 01:21:47,989
Maybe tomorrow.

624
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:54,121
Why kill you now that you are so depressed?

625
01:21:54,204 --> 01:21:58,000
I will kill you when you have something decent life.

626
01:21:59,418 --> 01:22:05,174
Then I'll find your mother, wife and your children.

627
01:22:05,257 --> 01:22:10,304
And I will confess them as you did to me!

628
01:22:12,306 --> 01:22:19,606
If you are lucky you die abroad. If you do not die on the day when you will live.

629
01:22:19,689 --> 01:22:22,692
Do you revenge I can wait that long?

630
01:22:25,987 --> 01:22:29,908
I think it can wait forever.

631
01:22:29,991 --> 01:22:34,955
Go ... before I change my mind.

632
01:23:10,534 --> 01:23:13,745
Five years later

633
01:23:13,829 --> 01:23:17,207
Hey, Dad. I will, I will.

634
01:23:18,834 --> 01:23:23,339
Man in gray suit could take you. Haier like small children.

635
01:23:23,422 --> 01:23:27,969
Well said, Dad. Sheila, no beer whenever there for John?

636
01:23:28,052 --> 01:23:30,137
It was a great day.

637
01:23:34,809 --> 01:23:37,854
John, everything is fine. He noted in the water.

638
01:23:37,937 --> 01:23:39,439
Yes, the ban on your feet.

639
01:23:41,816 --> 01:23:45,111
Do you talk to your dad? He refused to speak to me.

640
01:23:46,196 --> 01:23:47,989
He probably will not hit.

641
01:23:48,073 --> 01:23:52,244
Tell him that he welcome when he wants to.

642
01:23:55,455 --> 01:23:59,209
Do you feel good? Is that your hand?

643
01:24:02,671 --> 01:24:07,927
Could not we have fun for one day at least?

644
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:11,222
- It may be raining. - It's not a cloud in the sky.

645
01:24:11,305 --> 01:24:15,101
I will listen to struggle in the car.

646
01:24:15,184 --> 01:24:18,771
No, do not come here. John!

647
01:24:19,022 --> 01:24:22,901
John, please, stay with us.

648
01:24:25,612 --> 01:24:29,157
- He had just returned from abroad. - Who are you trying to fool?

649
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:32,911
He was always like that.
