00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:32,519
She can feel all of it,

187
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,887
But you can't move a muscle.

188
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:38,725
(Man laughing)

189
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:45,665
Let me see that.

190
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:47,700
No.

191
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:49,068
Adam.

192
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,971
(Loud rock music)

193
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:53,740
Adam!

194
00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:58,978
Where'd you find her?

195
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:00,613
Where'd you find her?

196
00:23:00,647 --> 00:23:01,881
What difference does it make?

197
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:05,518
- She's a fuckin' nurse.
- She's a goddamn whore!

198
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:07,654
Fuck this.

199
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:11,424
Fuck that tight
ass fuckin' bitch,

200
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,560
She ain't no fuckin' nurse,
she's a fuckin' whore.

201
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:14,861
She's a fuckin' whore.

202
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:18,698
(Loud rock music)

203
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:23,570
(Man grunting loudly)

204
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:26,906
Get in there.

205
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:29,175
Come on.

206
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,678
(Man moaning)

207
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,951
(Door opening)

208
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:44,691
[Dr. Sgundud] Julia.

209
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:48,728
(Ominous music)

210
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,712
I understand you never
went to the police.

211
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:12,685
And, did you
document any of this?

212
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:14,587
The marks.

213
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,991
Go to the hospital?

214
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:25,064
May I ask why?

215
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:34,741
(Clock ticking)

216
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:39,612
I want those men to suffer.

217
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:45,918
[Dr. Sgundud] If personal
revenge is what you're after,

218
00:24:45,952 --> 00:24:48,921
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

219
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:54,694
Making it personal will
keep you in a victim mindset

220
00:24:55,562 --> 00:24:58,097
And will prevent
you from healing.

221
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,232
Julia. Julia.

222
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:03,169
Please understand we will
still tackle the problem

223
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:05,605
In the physical world.

224
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:08,274
We will cut it at its root,

225
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:13,045
But in a manner that helps
you transcend the ego

226
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:17,083
And brings you true
and lasting freedom,

227
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:19,151
Where I can assure you,

228
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:22,789
No one will ever hold
power over you again.

229
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:32,665
There are, however,
some conditions

230
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:36,603
You should be aware of, in
case you choose to proceed.

231
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:39,205
You will need to give
yourself over, completely,

232
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:41,173
To my methods,

233
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,976
And should you, at
any time, take matters

234
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,879
Into your own hands,
you must realize

235
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:49,616
There will be
severe consequences.

236
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,085
Do you understand?

245
00:26:55,882 --> 00:26:58,117
[Sadie] Your
training starts now.

246
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:16,736
Sit.

247
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,639
You wanna be a little
girl your whole life?

248
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,910
Sit down.

249
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:42,361
(Eyeglasses crunching)

250
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,932
You got contacts, I hope.

251
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:49,435
They weren't prescription.

252
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:09,455
Don't be mistaken.

253
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,126
You are perfect as you are.

254
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:17,930
We all are.

255
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:25,004
But to lure them, we play
society's little game.

256
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:31,377
Painted face,

257
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:37,784
Mask, complete denial

258
00:28:39,185 --> 00:28:41,754
Of our creatureliness.

259
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,058
You're stunning.

260
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:48,761
You don't need me
to tell you that.

261
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:53,332

(Heavy metal music)

264
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:40,913
We want the ones who think the
world revolves around them.

265
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:45,484
Their bank accounts,
their puny little dicks.

266
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:49,521
The pseudo-macho
corporate types who

267
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:55,561
Pop Viagra pills on the sly.

268
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:01,000
We want the ones with
their lady friends.

269
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:03,435
See, they'll follow
without letting on.

270
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:11,310
Now listen, no one can
see you make your move.

271
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:13,980
When you exit, you exit alone.

272
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,149
Observe.

273
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:21,220
(Exciting club music)

274
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:58,357
Wait for it.

275
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,393
Wait for it.

276
00:31:01,427 --> 00:31:05,264
(People talking)

277
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,503
Now.

278
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:15,441
Usually, we make them
follow us outside,

279
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:18,510
But just for show.

280
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:22,881

281

284
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:05,958
Shot of vodka.

285
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:11,363
I can get that for
ya. Make that two shots.

286
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,545
Hey so, what's your name?

287
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:28,981
Okay.

288
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,989
Look, you don't
wanna talk to him.

289
00:32:37,023 --> 00:32:40,092
You don't want any
direct contact.

290
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:43,462
People see you together,
you become a liability.

291
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:49,601
And you don't walk
right up next to him.

292
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:55,041
(Upbeat club music)

293
00:33:29,475 --> 00:33:34,146

Hey.

295

You little slut.

296
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,312
You wanna piece
of this guy, huh?

297
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:30,536
Sick bastard!

298
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,371
Fuck you, what the
fuck are you doing?

299
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:33,872
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

300
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,407
I didn't do nothin', I swear.

301
00:34:35,441 --> 00:34:38,644
- I saw you!
- It's nothin' baby, please.

302

(Somber music)

303
00:35:02,268 --> 00:35:04,670
She would stand there watching

304
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:10,609
As the pig breathed down on me

305
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:15,314
And it was my fault.

306
00:35:16,515 --> 00:35:19,251
He wanted me more than her.

307
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:23,555
His own wife?

308
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:28,460
My mother.

309
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:35,501
She's the one who told everyone.

310
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:40,806
Friends, school.

311
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:47,846
Julia is a whore.
Julia is a whore.

[Dr. Sgundud] Was that the
first time you cut yourself?

314
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:04,596
You never thought to...
Kill myself?

315
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:10,269
But I didn't.

316
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,443
And it wasn't out of fear.

317
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,581
It was something else.

318
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,553
It's like I,

319
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:31,557
It's like I knew

320
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:36,562
I was meant for something,

321
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:38,497
Something

322
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:43,302
Majestic.

[Dr. Sgundud] The next
stage of your therapy

330

Will be recorded.

331
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:53,605
In part, so we don't lose
sight of the clinical nature

332
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:55,674
Of the proceedings,

333
00:37:57,409 --> 00:38:00,045
But also for insurance purposes.

334
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:06,485
Some patients, they

335
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:09,287
Struggle with the ramifications.

336
00:38:12,658 --> 00:38:14,860
You'll forgive me for not
going into more detail

337
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:16,528
At this time,

338
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,932
But don't worry.

there to guide you.

340

There is one other thing.

342
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:34,813
[Dr. Sgundud] Yes?

343
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:37,649
I saw one of them.

344
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:40,952

345
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:48,627
I think he was looking for me.

346

[Dr. Sgundud] What
do you think he wants?

347
00:38:57,603 --> 00:38:59,605
[Julia] Forgiveness.

348
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:05,677
[Dr. Sgundud] How
does that make you feel?

349
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,454
Julia? Fantasizing
about the past,

350
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:17,756
Blaming others for
what's happened to you,

351
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:20,459
Goes against what
we're doing here.

352
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:26,832
It is imperative that
you not make it personal.

353
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:34,906
I can only say that would
be a very dangerous path.

354
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:37,576

00:45:56,054 --> 00:46:00,291
(Man breathing heavily)

371
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:27,252
(Man gasping)

372
00:46:28,954 --> 00:46:32,490
(Julia moaning softly)

373
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:34,826
Oh God, I'm gonna cum.

374
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:38,796
Oh wait.

375
00:46:39,965 --> 00:46:42,934
(Julia moaning)

376
00:46:47,906 --> 00:46:50,275
[Man] Oh shit, I'm gonna cum.

377
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:52,510
(Sinister music)
What the fuck?

378
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:54,479
Oh my God! What the fuck?

379
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:57,482
(Loud sinister music)

380
00:46:57,515 --> 00:47:01,386
(Man screaming)

381
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:39,557
(Chilling music)

382
00:48:18,196 --> 00:48:21,967
(Water running)

383
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,071
(Dramatic music)

384
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:06,477
(Gentle guitar music)

385
00:49:38,443 --> 00:49:42,613
(Steady drum beat)

386
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:06,171
(Upbeat music)

387
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:47,612
[Patient] Why don't we go
ahead and cut it out right now?

388
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:48,846
- Sorry, I should have...
- Yeah, nice of you

389
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,481
To join us, Julia.

390
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:53,551
Here just in time to
help remove a mole

391
00:50:53,584 --> 00:50:55,320
From Mr. Gordon's back.

392
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:05,530
Julia.

393
00:51:06,764 --> 00:51:08,566
Julia.

394
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:10,368
Scrub up.

395
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:24,582
(Water running)

396
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,144
She ain't no fuckin' nurse,

397
00:51:53,178 --> 00:51:54,679
She's a fuckin' whore.

398
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,518
Okay.

399
00:52:00,551 --> 00:52:03,654
Easy as pie.

400
00:52:03,688 --> 00:52:05,223
Now Julia will see to it

401
00:52:05,256 --> 00:52:07,658
That you're left without
so much as a scar.

402
00:52:35,553 --> 00:52:39,590
(Sinister music)

403
00:52:41,959 --> 00:52:43,594
(Door slams)

404
00:53:13,591 --> 00:53:17,695
(Keys clicking)

405
00:53:29,374 --> 00:53:33,844
(Ominous music)

406
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:50,461
(Sinister metal music)

407
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:03,401
Adam.

408
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,571
It's Julia.

409
00:55:14,379 --> 00:55:15,946
Julia, are you there?

410
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,415
[Julia] Yes.

411
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:19,584
Fuck, I can't
believe it's you.

412
00:55:19,617 --> 00:55:21,386
[Julia] I know.

413
00:55:22,453 --> 00:55:24,088
I really wanted
to talk to you.

414
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:26,090
I didn't mean to

415
00:55:26,123 --> 00:55:27,658
Show up at your
office like that,

416
00:55:27,692 --> 00:55:28,926
I just...

417
00:55:28,959 --> 00:55:31,429
I wasn't sure if you'd see me.

418
00:55:32,563 --> 00:55:33,964
Ever since that night,
I haven't stopped

419
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:36,000
Thinking about you.

420
00:55:40,137 --> 00:55:42,407
Something, I don't know,

421
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,542
Something inside me changed.

422
00:55:46,711 --> 00:55:49,380
Is there a chance we could meet

423
00:55:49,414 --> 00:55:51,081
Just to talk?

424
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:53,451
Please?

425
00:55:59,624 --> 00:56:00,758
(Thud)

426
00:56:01,526 --> 00:56:03,093
Fuck.

427
00:56:03,127 --> 00:56:05,396
Sorry.

428
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:12,637
(Door creaking)

429
00:56:20,845 --> 00:56:21,879
What the fuck?

430
00:56:21,912 --> 00:56:23,614
What?

431
00:56:23,648 --> 00:56:24,715
What is this?

432
00:56:26,451 --> 00:56:27,151
It's nothing.

433
00:56:27,184 --> 00:56:28,753
What the fuck?

434
00:56:28,786 --> 00:56:30,555
It's just a little blood.

435
00:56:30,588 --> 00:56:32,923
So why is it all
over your fucking coat?

436
00:56:32,957 --> 00:56:34,625
You can't go out on your own,

437
00:56:34,659 --> 00:56:36,527
It doesn't work like that.

438
00:56:36,561 --> 00:56:38,429
Didn't he tell you?

439
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,835
Julia, what did you?

440
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:49,540
I work in a plastic
surgeon's office.

441
00:56:49,574 --> 00:56:51,442
People bleed.

442
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:56,781
So I missed a little, so what?

443
00:57:18,035 --> 00:57:20,037
[Sadie] Forgive me?

444
00:57:34,919 --> 00:57:37,722
I need you to listen to me.

445
00:57:37,755 --> 00:57:40,658
You're one of his children now.

446
00:57:41,258 --> 00:57:43,594
He'll look after you,

447
00:57:43,628 --> 00:57:46,731
But God forbid you
go against him.

448
00:57:47,765 --> 00:57:50,535
You can't go against this man.

449
00:57:55,673 --> 00:57:57,007
Look at you.

450
00:57:57,608 --> 00:57:59,744
You don't understand.

451
00:57:59,777 --> 00:58:01,646
I've seen it.

452
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:05,650
He takes everything.

453
00:58:05,683 --> 00:58:09,654
(Sad music)

454
00:58:26,604 --> 00:58:28,706
Shh.

455
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:45,756
When this is all over,

456
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:50,260
I want us to get away.

457
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:55,232
Just Julia and Sadie.

458
00:58:58,068 --> 00:59:00,871
Far, far away.

459
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:11,115
(Distant sirens)

460
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:34,138
Sadie, what are you doing?

461
00:59:35,272 --> 00:59:38,876
(Television chatter)

462
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:42,747
(Water running)

463
00:59:47,685 --> 00:59:49,754
[Reporter] The body of a
33 year-old man was found

464
00:59:49,787 --> 00:59:52,356
Brutally murdered in the
early hours of the morning

465
00:59:52,389 --> 00:59:55,793
Near Brooklyn Sunset
Park, Chinatown area.

466
00:59:55,826 --> 00:59:58,362
Police report today that
the victim, Marcus Ryan,

467
00:59:58,395 --> 01:00:00,765
A recent Harvard
Business School graduate,

468
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:02,800
Was found with over
90 knife wounds

469
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:04,635
To the head and torso,

470
01:00:04,669 --> 01:00:07,938
And in a startling addendum
to the already vicious attack,

471
01:00:07,972 --> 01:00:11,408
We have recently learned
that Ryan was also castrated.

472
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,211
Police are currently scouring
surveillance video footage

473
01:00:14,244 --> 01:00:16,346
From the hours leading
up to the murder,

474
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:19,149
But as of yet, there are
no leads or witnesses.

475
01:00:19,183 --> 01:00:21,285
Ryan was last seen
at the Balcony bar

476
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:23,654
In Brooklyn's hip
Williamsburg area,

477
01:00:23,688 --> 01:00:25,355
When, at some point
in the evening,

478
01:00:25,389 --> 01:00:27,692
He was said to have
simply disappeared.

479
01:00:27,725 --> 01:00:32,730
(Sinister music)

480
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:58,923
(Glass bottles clinking)

481
01:00:58,956 --> 01:01:02,760
(Sinister music)

482
01:01:46,103 --> 01:01:47,437
Hey.

483
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:58,115
What am I gonna do with you?

484
01:02:22,539 --> 01:02:26,443
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

485
01:02:27,444 --> 01:02:30,280
Julia, what is
going on with you?

486
01:02:32,182 --> 01:02:35,252
Ever since you were
gone for that week...

487
01:02:42,526 --> 01:02:45,295
[Dr. Lin's assistant] Dr. Lin?

488
01:02:49,466 --> 01:02:52,002
I want you to come see me
in my office before you go.

489
01:02:52,036 --> 01:02:53,437
Okay?

490
01:02:54,404 --> 01:02:56,340
Yeah, Valerie.

491
01:02:56,373 --> 01:02:57,541
[Dr. Lin's assistant] Would
you mind taking a quick look

492
01:02:57,574 --> 01:02:58,976
At this?
Sure, sure.

493
01:02:59,009 --> 01:03:03,280
(Sinister music)

494
01:03:43,087 --> 01:03:46,991
(Train tracks squealing)

495
01:03:50,594 --> 01:03:54,999
(Sinister music)

496
01:04:09,313 --> 01:04:11,515
[Adam] I thought
you'd go to the cops.

497
01:04:11,548 --> 01:04:14,018
I thought, any day now.

498
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:18,222
Then, when nothing happened

499
01:04:19,389 --> 01:04:21,325
I had to find you.

500
01:04:28,232 --> 01:04:29,599
I was weak.

501
01:04:29,633 --> 01:04:32,102
I should have stopped them.

502
01:04:33,938 --> 01:04:38,608
Even if it... sorry.

503
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:44,614
Funny thing is, in a way,

504
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:47,517
It's the best thing
that could have

505
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:49,519
Ever happened to me.

506
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,990
Up until then, I was

507
01:04:54,158 --> 01:04:56,226
Hiding from the world.

508
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:02,967
Suddenly, I was forced
to look at myself.

509
01:05:05,002 --> 01:05:09,239
Any notion that I had
of myself, as a woman,

510
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,675
A victim,

511
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:16,246
Soft, defenseless.

512
01:05:20,017 --> 01:05:21,986
It vanished.

513
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:32,229
(Cars passing)

514
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:46,176
You are not like them.

515
01:05:48,578 --> 01:05:50,680
I saw that.

516
01:05:51,515 --> 01:05:54,318
I saw what they did to you.

517
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:02,659
Julia, I'll do
anything for you.

518
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:05,695
Whatever you say.

519
01:06:12,236 --> 01:06:14,538
Actually there is something.

520
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:20,477
I think it would be good for me

521
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:22,546
To see the other two

522
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:24,581
From that night.

523
01:06:26,683 --> 01:06:29,619
Well, not Piers.

524
01:06:32,189 --> 01:06:34,524
I think I need
more time for him.

525
01:06:36,093 --> 01:06:38,262
But the other two.

526
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:45,469
I think it would really help.

527
01:06:48,438 --> 01:06:50,340
Help me heal.

528
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:56,246
(Cars passing)

529
01:07:09,626 --> 01:07:14,264
(Mellow music)

530
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,502
[Adam] Be right back.

531
01:07:42,692 --> 01:07:44,328
[Dr. Sgundud] Love.

532
01:07:46,663 --> 01:07:48,365
Weakness.

533
01:07:54,504 --> 01:07:55,739
What did you think,
the two of you

534
01:07:55,772 --> 01:07:57,241
Were going to run away together

535
01:07:57,274 --> 01:07:59,343
And live happily ever after?

536
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:07,851
You will go to her apartment,

537
01:08:07,884 --> 01:08:10,854
And see what you can
find on a certain

538
01:08:10,887 --> 01:08:12,522
Adam.

539
01:08:12,556 --> 01:08:14,491
(Door creaking)

540
01:08:22,499 --> 01:08:24,534
Thank you, Sadie.

541
01:08:34,211 --> 01:08:37,113
I need you to watch
this Piers Malone

542
01:08:37,681 --> 01:08:39,683
Because something
is going to happen

543
01:08:39,716 --> 01:08:42,686
With him and my patient.

544
01:08:49,726 --> 01:08:53,763
(Suspenseful electronic music)

545
01:09:59,663 --> 01:10:03,967
(Thumping electronic music)

546
01:10:45,675 --> 01:10:47,744
Shotty, shotty, shot. Here.

547
01:10:47,777 --> 01:10:49,879
This shot is for you.

548
01:11:09,966 --> 01:11:12,402
[Julia] Vodka

549
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:22,579
(Frantic arguing)

550
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:26,750
(Intense electronic music)

551
01:12:33,517 --> 01:12:36,953
(Drawers rattling)

552
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:50,567
(Sinister music)

553
01:12:59,175 --> 01:13:00,410
Woo!

554
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:02,546
Yes, yes!

555
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:05,749

But I thought I saved...

you, at any time,

Take matters into
your own hands,

616

There will be
severe consequences.

617
01:22:10,459 --> 01:22:14,163

you not make it personal.

632
01:23:44,353 --> 01:23:46,455
Put on her makeup.

633
01:23:50,726 --> 01:23:53,496
But my father, he
could never accept

634
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:56,599
That a child of his
was not perfect.

635
01:24:02,805 --> 01:24:04,540
So he cut me.

636
01:24:17,186 --> 01:24:21,590
My child, did I not warn you?

we've been expecting her.

continue this festival.

get outta here.
