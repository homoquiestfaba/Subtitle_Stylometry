No, if a woman loves a man,
it doesn't matter what he has.

he's got to give

00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:42,767
You gimme the number, huh?

00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:45,437
Hey. What are you, a meatball?
Huh?

00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,472
This is Kathy, she,
she gets us the women,

00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:49,307
she sets us up with the women,
she's not a woman.

00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,042
Oh, thank you, Philipo.

00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,578
You know,
you know what I mean.
You know what I mean, dove.

00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,246
I'll be right back.

00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,514
Your English.

00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:59,484
I think it's very cute.

00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:00,952
-Oh, yeah?
-Mmm-hmm.

00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:08,059
What is this, eh...
What is a this "cute"?

00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,096
I said, what are you
lookin' at?

00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,464
Hey, hey, hey.

00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,332
Hey, come here.

00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:15,767
What's a matter?

00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,903
Huh? You're not having
a good time?

00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,372
Problems.

00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:21,806
Yeah, you bet too high.

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,508
You know, I see,
you get crazy.

00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:25,243
Hey, I'm talkin' to you!

00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,379
-Come here!
-(GRUNTS)

00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:30,148
Hey, you see we're
in the middle of a
conversation here?

00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,282
Get out of here!

00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,352
I like to work for you.

00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:37,422
See, I think I make
a good gigolo, like a Philipo.

00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:39,224
-(LAUGHS)
-He tell me all about you.

00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:40,291
All right.

00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,260
How much you owe?

00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,397
Fourteen.

00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,464
Fourteen hundred?

00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,401
Thousand.

00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,302
Fourteen thousand?

00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,713
I got an idea,
maybe I can help you out.

00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:03,782
How?

00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,817
Follow me.

00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,321
(GRUNTS)

00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,556
WOMAN: Oh, my God!

00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,995
The way you punched him
was beautiful.

00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,898
-(ALFREDO LAUGHS)
-Come here,
I wanna introduce you.

00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:22,267
This is my very,
very good friend, Nardo.

00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,137
And this is the most lovely
and beautiful Kathy Hamilton.

00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,207
Fredo, you and I are dancin'.

00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,042
Ba-ba-ba-bup! We're dancin'.

00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:32,844
Have a good time. Come on.

00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:36,047
That was a very
impressive performance.

00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,917
Sit down before you tear
the place apart.

00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:45,790
So, tell me about yourself.

00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:47,692
I'm a business man.

00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,993
Oh, really?

00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,663
So am I.

00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:53,531
You don't look like
a man to me.

00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,468
Money problems?

00:28:57,535 --> 00:29:00,271
It's normal
for business people.

00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,240
Some months
are better than others.

00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,943
But a handsome man like you.

00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:13,318
My, but you have bedroom eyes.

00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,288
-(SIGHS)
-(LAUGHS)

00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:21,693
Don't worry, I'm not coming
on to you. I just think
maybe I could help.

00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:24,462
I run a dating service
for rich women.

00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:26,731
I help them find escorts.

00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,933
Men to attend parties
with them.

00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:31,102
I, uh, know what an escort is.

00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:34,506
They pay a lot of money.

00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,509
A lot.

00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,745
To be with a handsome,
strong man like you.

00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:42,747
KATHY: Wait.

00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,049
You've had a rough night.

00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,452
Go home and rest
and tomorrow,

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,556
come by my office
and we'll talk, hmm?

00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:56,161
I'll think about it.

00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:14,846
Thanks.

00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:18,016
You no go to work today,
you stay home.

00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:22,320
Ma, I have a business to run,
I can't stay home.

00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:25,190
You see how your wife
don't stay home
and take care of you?

00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:28,426
All she care about
is her mother coming.

00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,328
Ma, I'm fine.
I just have a headache.

00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:36,067
I gonna make you some
chickie brodo.

00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,802
Gonna make you all better.

00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,837
Okay.

00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,128
(COUGHS AND CLEARS THROAT)

00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:08,199
I'm here to see Kathy.

00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:10,568
And you are?

00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,370
Leonardo.

00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:15,907
Sure. But you are...

00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,611
What? I'm a man.

00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:29,821
Kathy, there's a Mr. Leonardo
here to see you.

00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,160
Mmm. Well, take a seat.

00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:37,996
She'll be with you
in a minute.

00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,111
You're a jockey, no?

00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,079
Yep.

00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,282
You race Kentucky Derby?

00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:59,384
Oh, yeah, sure.

00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,753
I ride anything that whinnies.

00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:03,821
Let me ask you something,

00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:05,290
who do you think's
gonna win this year?

00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,025
(TELEPHONE BUZZES)

00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,526
How the hell
should I know, huh?

00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,528
RECEPTIONIST: Leonardo?

00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:19,470
Lehman Brothers?

00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,439
Date time.

00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:35,887
I was afraid
you wouldn't come.

00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:39,691
I decided I'm gonna listen
to what you have to say.

00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,426
Good.

00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,329
Look, Leonardo,
you're a handsome guy,

00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:46,364
mature, respectful,
European...

00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:48,866
I have a few clients

00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,935
very distantly
related to nobility,

00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,804
and they like to turn up
at social events

00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:54,505
with a European
aristocrat type.

00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:55,540
What do you think?

00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,077
I'm no aristocrat.

00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,578
Oh, yes, yes.

00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,581
But can you act like one?

00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:06,384
I don't know. Maybe.

00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:09,854
I need a count in my stable.

00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:12,323
I can keep you very busy.

00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,726
And I'd like to start you off
right away, interested?

00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:16,928
I think, yes.

00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,262
Good.

00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:22,100
A few rules of the house.

00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,469
One, never take
a client's number.

00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,537
If you try to set up
a date without me...

00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,940
Well, just don't do it.

00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,476
Okay.

00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,645
Two, never divulge publicly
that you are a paid escort.

00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,680
And three...

00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:39,050
Client is always right.

00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:42,520
Whatever she wants,
she'll pay you for.

00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:43,888
But she's not
to be turned down.

00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:44,922
That would humiliate her.

00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,427
What do you mean,
"Whatever she wants"?

00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,463
Well, if she wants to walk,

00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,233
don't insist on taking a taxi.

00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:58,369
If she wants to eat ice cream
mixed with caviar,

00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,304
then so do you, understand?

00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,940
-Okay. It's no big deal.
-Good.

00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,576
Now find yourself
a tux that fits.

00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,211
Tonight you'll be attending
the opera

00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:08,846
with Countess Fabiola.

00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:12,550
And let's see...

00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:15,820
Why don't we call you

00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:18,322
Count Favo Chandon?

00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:21,659
-Chandon. This is French.
-Yes.

00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:22,860
And Favo is Italian,

00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,630
that way we cover
the whole Euro thing, right?

00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:27,665
Okay. You're the boss.

00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:29,734
Mmm. That's the attitude.

00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:31,936
It's fun, Leonardo.

00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,371
You'll see,
just enjoy yourself.

00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:35,973
And remember,

00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,742
the client is always right.

00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:41,712
Nardo?

00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,381
Listen, will you be home
when I get back tonight?

00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,682
Oh, I'm sorry, baby, no,

00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,384
I'm going out
with Alfredo tonight.

00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,286
Okay, listen, well,
try not to drink too much
like you did last time,

00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:49,854
-I don't want you to get sick.
-No, no.

00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,089
-Okay.
-What time you coming home?

00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:52,156
Mmm. Around 10.

00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,925
If you stay home,
your husband stay home.

00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:56,227
If you go out,
your husband go out.

00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,262
You forgot
I was home last night.

00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:01,199
Men can go out with other men.
It's natural.

00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:03,568
My brother,
Father Vincenzo the priest,

00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,936
he always say,

00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:08,973
"An honest woman
belongs in the house
and not on the street.

00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:11,242
"The street belongs
to men and dogs."

00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,078
Hmm. And what does
Father Vincent know
about women, huh?

00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,180
He seems to know an awful lot
for being a priest.

00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:17,281
Anna, please.

00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:18,783
Well, wait, I'm sick
and tired of hearing

00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:20,384
how perfect Vincent is.

00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:21,953
If your family is so perfect,

00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:23,955
how come Lucia's knocked up?
Huh?

00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:26,224
What does knocked up mean?

00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:28,092
-(CRYING)
-Anna, go to class,

00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,228
and l, and I will talk to you
when you get back, please.

00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:31,362
-Enough is enough.
-All right.

00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:32,630
-Listen, I got to go,
all right?
-Bye.

00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:33,764
-I'll see you later.
-Yeah.

00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:35,967
Oh, Madonna...

00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:08,599
You were wonderful tonight.

00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:12,470
Did you enjoy the opera?

00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,205
Ah, yes, very much.

00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,509
Opera is exercise
for the heart.

00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:21,245
(LAUGHING)

00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:26,551
Oh, you are a charming man,
Favo.

00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:29,687
I'm sorry the Marquis
put you on the spot like that.

00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,724
I'd like to give you...

00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:35,826
A tip.

00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:38,663
Hmm?

00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,134
Thank you, Countess.

00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:50,007
Oh. I believe
I deserve a real kiss.

00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,548
Oh...

00:36:58,249 --> 00:36:59,550
Don't tell me...

00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,652
You don't know...

00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:05,323
How to kiss.

00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,069
Good boy.

00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:21,405
Now run along.

00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:24,275
-(LAUGHING)
-(COUGHING)

00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,010
ANGELO: You laugh, huh?

00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,579
(LAUGHING)

00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:31,849
ANGELO: Last man
who owe me money...

00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:34,819
I took his wife.

00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:37,455
I don't believe it!
What a despicable thing
to say.

00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,692
Who? From the neighborhood?
Whose wife, huh?

00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:43,761
No, no, no, I don't tell you.

00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:45,796
But I took her.
In my warehouse.

00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,200
Why you do that?

00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:50,234
ANGELO: Listen...

00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,804
A woman is like money, huh?

00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:55,339
You take her
for your pleasure.

00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:56,440
Hah.

00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,708
And this man,
he had no money.

00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:01,279
But he had a beautiful wife.
Beautiful.

00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,850
Like Leonardo, huh?

00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:14,292
That's ridiculous.

00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:16,193
Nardo would never
let you have Anna.

00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:20,765
What choice does he have? Hmm?

00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,035
You'll see.

00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:29,540
I only take
what is mine already.

00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:08,479
Hmm...

00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:12,249
I believe
I deserve a real kiss.

00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:20,591
Don't tell me
you don't know how to kiss.

00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,374
Oh, come on, don't worry.

00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:38,976
Don't worry,

00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,389
She told him...

00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,725
-About the baby, you know?
-Yes.

00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,127
He doesn't care!

00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:00,231

00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,702
You know in Italy

00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,237
he would have
had to marry her.

00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,538
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,307

I don't know what to do...

Oh, no, Lucia,

00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:26,223
she don't want
nobody getting involved.

00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,993
What, Lucia,
this is not her problem!

00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,529
Yeah, how...

How can we force, there?

I should be included.

-I don't know, some guy
she's been seeing.

00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:23,093
Oh, Anna, honey,
it's the holiday pressure.

of holiday depression.

Anna, I think she has a better
head on her shoulders, no?

00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:20,377
Maybe her and I, we can, uh...

00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:52,188
-What happened?
-Rose, he grabbed me!

00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:53,790
Who grabbed you?

00:59:54,824 --> 00:59:56,759
He grabbed me,
I couldn't stop him!

00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:58,895
He kissed me, he grabbed me,
he wouldn't let go!

00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:01,064
Okay, who grabbed you,
who? Who, sweetie?

01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,266
-Angelo! Nardo's friend.
-Okay.

01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:06,669
Oh, God, I'm gonna kill him.
l am.

01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:09,072
He's gonna kill him.
Rose, he's gonna kill him!

01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,407
What, you gonna tell Nardo,
what, are you crazy?

01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,276
-But...
-No, listen to me, listen,
listen!

01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:16,479
Now you listen to me.

01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:19,215
You tell Nardo,
and he's gonna kill him.

01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:21,718
A husband is no good in jail!

01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:24,654
I'm telling you.
Ask my mother.

01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,323
I don't know.

01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:29,859
All right. Look, you...

01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:32,095
You just pull yourself
together here, okay?

01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:34,397
Now look, you got
this schmutz over here...

01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:36,499
Let me just fix you up,
all right?

01:00:36,532 --> 01:00:38,434
Then you look fine
and you go home

01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,570
and you don't say nothin'!

01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:42,705
You hear me, sweetie,
I mean it.

01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,140
Okay?

01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:45,575
I don't know.

01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:50,513
Be careful,
don't break it.

01:00:50,546 --> 01:00:53,216
It's a sin to waste food.

01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,718
(DOORBELL RINGING)

01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:05,495
Ciao, Nina.

01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:08,865
Isabella, you are
not welcome in my house.

01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:13,603
Oh, I see you haven't changed
at all and I am happy
to see you too.

01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:16,139
-Grandma, Grandma
-(GASPS)

01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,940
Oh,  principessa!

01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:20,710
Look at you,
what a little lady you are.

01:01:20,743 --> 01:01:24,147
Joanne, darling,
it's time for you
to go to bed, dear.

01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:28,051
Well, I will put her
to bed but first,

01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:30,753
would you like to see
what Grandma brought you
from Italy?

01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:32,789
-Yeah
-Yes. Come, let's go.

01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,394
Your bags.

01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:02,819
-Nardo
-Yes, Mama.

01:02:02,852 --> 01:02:06,322
-Nardo, she's here. Isabella.
-Why? Why?

01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:08,124
-Mama, Mama, Mama.
-What are you gonna do?

01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:11,260
-Get her out of this house.
-Nardo, Nardo.

01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:13,796
Oh, thank God you're here.
I need to talk to you.

01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:15,598
Okay, turn around
you have a surprise.

01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:16,899
-Anna.
-Mama.

01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:18,801
Karina.

01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:22,305
-When did you get here?
-A few minutes ago.
I saw the baby.

01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:25,508
She is lovely.
She's such a big girl.

01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:26,809
And you're beautiful.

01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:28,444
-Oh, God, it's so good to...
-Hi.

01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:32,648
-Nardo
-How are you?
I'll see you upstairs, okay.

01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:35,651
-Well, I have so much
to tell you.
-Mama, tell me everything.

01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:38,020
-We're thinking of buying
the Borghese Museum.
-Really?

01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:39,822
(IMITATING)

01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:43,593
Nardo, you should see
Mom and I. We were...

01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:55,772
Tere, it's me.

01:02:55,805 --> 01:02:57,840
(TERESA SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

01:02:57,874 --> 01:03:01,277
She's here.
The son of a bitch
is in my house.

01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,717
She come dressed
like a
puttana.
No respect.

01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:11,454
Today, I'm gonna kill her.

01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:12,955
TERESA:  Mama mia...

01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:14,791
I call you after.

01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:24,200
-Nardo?
-Mmm?

01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,872
Are you seeing another woman?

01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:33,810
How can you say that
after...

01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,045
Come on.

01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:40,116
But passion and love
aren't the same thing.

01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:43,653
Oh, what are you
talking about?

01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:53,129
When I was growing up,
I was so alone.

01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:58,835
Everyone used to judge me
because of Mama.

01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:02,138
You're not alone now.
I'm with you.

01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:06,442
Yeah, but I don't wanna
feel that way anymore.

01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:13,616
Nina, when we get the
new creche in,

01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:16,419
we put the baby Jesus
in there in that...

01:04:17,253 --> 01:04:19,655
Ah, what's wrong?

01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:20,690
She's here.

01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:25,661
Isabella arrived last night
in my house.

01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:28,130
Dio.

01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:32,068
Father, what can you do
to send her back to Italy?

01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:36,405
I can only talk to her.

01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:40,243
I'll call her today
and see if she can
stop by to see me.

01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:41,878
Oh, Father.

01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:44,113
Make sure she go back
for good.

01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:47,617
And this is Grandpa and...

01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,820
-Is this Mommy?
-Yes.

01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:53,456
When she was a little girl
just like you.

01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:56,726
I wanna have
a little baby girl
just like that.

01:04:56,759 --> 01:04:58,594
And raise her in my own house.

01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:01,063
Oh, and you will,
my love, you will.

01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:06,002
I raised your Mama
all by myself
in this very house.

01:05:06,035 --> 01:05:07,837
Where was Grandpa?

01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:11,774
Oh, he was very,
very far away.

01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:16,178
I know Isabella
left the church
many years ago.

01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:20,082
When she came home
with the baby and no father.

01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:24,220
Yes, you know. You know.

01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:27,056
I know I told you
I would help you.

01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:29,992
But not in the way you think.

01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:34,897
I think I should help you
to forgive.

01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:39,201
-Forgive?
-Yes.

01:05:40,736 --> 01:05:42,004
Forgive?

01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:46,776
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:05:46,809 --> 01:05:51,280
If you could forgive Lucia,
why can you
not forgive Isabella?

01:05:51,314 --> 01:05:55,184
Because Lucia
is an innocent girl.
She was fooled.

01:05:55,217 --> 01:06:00,456
That man.
He has no fear of God.
He's not even a Catholic.

01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:01,991
-He's not Catholic?
-No.

01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:06,963
And Lucia, she is
an innocent child.

01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:12,368
And Isabella was innocent
once, too.

01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:15,638
(CRYING)

01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:17,840
You no help me, you help her.

01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:28,751
I wish my brother,
Vincenzo the priest,
could be here now.

01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:30,519
He would know the difference.

01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:35,157
-Yeah
-You never mind. Leonardo will
take care of Isabella.

01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:36,192
Mmm-hmm.

01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:38,694
Forgive?

01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:41,397
Never.

01:06:44,066 --> 01:06:45,701
(CRYING)

ROSE: Hey, where's your
Christmas spirit?

01:06:51,407 --> 01:06:53,642
I don't know, wherever I left
my Christmas money.

01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,811
Oh, there's always
credit cards.

01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:58,180
Why have them
if you're not gonna use them?

01:06:58,214 --> 01:06:59,682
You have enough of them.

01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:01,584
Ooh, this will cheer you up.

01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:06,655
Um, Victor was bragging
about the fact

01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:11,293
that he slept with me
to everybody,
all the other executives.

01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:14,530
-Wait a minute, Victor...
-Nah, nah, this was
a different guy.

01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:16,799
-So, you know what I did?
-What did you do?

01:07:16,832 --> 01:07:22,304
I told everybody in the office
he was... That big.

01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:25,041
-You didn't. You didn't.
-Wrecked his reputation.

01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:26,575
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:28,577
God, Rose you know
that's not so great
for your reputation, either.

01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:31,547
Oh, come on,
what do I look like,
your mother-in-law?

01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,749
Let her worry
about reputation.

01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:35,885
Yeah, she's so worried about
everybody else's reputation

01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:38,020
she's been cooking
like a maniac.

01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:40,122
You should see it,
all that stuff
in the refrigerator,

01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:41,991
she never throws anything out.

01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:44,960
I swear, she spends more time
in the oven than a suicide.

01:07:44,994 --> 01:07:49,565
-God... I swear this picture
looks like Nardo.
-What?

01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:53,102
But Nardo doesn't
wear glasses, right?

01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:01,577
Dammit.

01:08:04,313 --> 01:08:06,415
That son of a bitch is
cheating on me.

01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:16,192
-He's gonna deny it.
-What are you gonna do?

01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:26,769
He's been going
out constantly.

01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:29,371
Next time, he goes out,
you and I
are gonna follow him.

01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:32,208
-Okay.
-Okay, we'll take your car
and we'll follow him.

01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:35,144
And I'm gonna kill that bitch
and I'm gonna kill him, too.

01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:40,516
-Kill them both.
-Okay, okay, but I need
to get gas first.

01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:58,767
-Isabella.
-Father.

01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,137
-Thank you for coming.
-It's good to see you.

01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:05,274
-You look wonderful
-Thank you.

01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:07,710
-Come, let's sit and talk.
-Yes.

-(CLEARS THROAT)
-(SIGHS)

01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:12,081
So?

01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:17,887
So, well, it seems I irritate
a certain very frustrated
old woman

01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,889
(LAUGHS)

01:09:19,922 --> 01:09:23,959
I think I know.
But didn't you encourage it?

01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:26,695
Oh, come, Father.
I know you've known me
a long time

01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:29,265
but you don't really know me.

01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:32,401
No one does.
Certainly not Nina.

01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:35,037
And though you presided
at my wedding with Franco,

01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:37,540
you don't know Franco either.

01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:39,175
I know him
since he's a little boy.

01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:41,610
You do not know Franco's pain.

01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:50,386
Franco, deep inside,
loved man.

01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,556
-Not woman.
-Dio.

01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:57,826
Everyone thought
this was the perfect marriage.

01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:01,830
Beautiful Isabella and Franco,
son of the richest man
in town.

01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:07,236
That marriage
never really existed.
Thank God, along came Eduardo.

01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:09,371
-The painter?
-The painter.

01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:11,674
But that was not blessed
by God either.

01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:16,845
Ah, but he gave me something.
Franco could not,
he give me a child.

01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:22,117
Father, Franco was unable
to love a woman.

01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:25,321
Isabella, why didn't you tell
me? You could have had
an annulment.

01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:29,225
Oh, no.
I had to protect Franco.
I could not tell anybody.

01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:32,161
Besides, it was not his fault.

01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:34,730
I understand.

01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:37,433
You do?

01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:41,103
-Yes.
-Good.

01:10:41,136 --> 01:10:46,041
Because I think sometime soon
Nina also has to understand.

01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:48,143
But, why now?

01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:53,048
Because I come to this country
and I find Nina
tormenting my Anna.

01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:55,818
So it is time for Nina
to know the truth.

01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:57,620
Ah, the truth.

01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:03,259
-So hard to believe sometimes.
-Mmm, I know.

01:11:04,126 --> 01:11:05,327
I...

01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:08,330
Father, can you help me?

01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:13,035
-Of course.
-Grazie.

01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:15,070
Grazie tanto.

01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,875
Oh, by the way,

01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:25,080
-do you have all your money
yet for the nativity scene?
-Well, not all of it.

01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:28,450
Good. Now, you do.

01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:31,287
Merry Christmas.

01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,722
Merry Christmas to you, Bella.

01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:37,293
-Arrivederla.
-Arrivederla.

01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:52,274
-So you're leaving?
-Uh-huh.

01:12:00,282 --> 01:12:03,786
Rose, it's me.
Yeah, he left now,
come pick me up.

01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:05,788
Rose, your car
is a piece of shit.

01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:08,424
-Hey
-What is that noise?

01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:11,360
Come on, my car is okay.
It's good for surveillance.

01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:13,362
(SIGHS)

01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:16,332
I'm gonna kill him.
I'm gonna kill them both.

01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:19,368
All right, honey, look, just
come on, you know, relax

01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:21,303
let's just wait and see
what happens.

01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:24,506
The whole thing can be
this big mistake here,
you know.

01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:02,578
Didn't I tell you,
never turn down
a client's request.

01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:05,748
For Christ sake, who do you
think you are?

01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:07,616
Miss Worthy is one
of my best clients.

01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:10,619
She feels totally humiliated.
I may lose her altogether.

01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,188
What's your damn problem?

01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:15,624
I couldn't do it.

01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,829
I count on you to get it up
no matter who the client is.

01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:23,899
That's what I hired you for.

01:13:23,932 --> 01:13:26,101
If this gets out
to Fabiola or Mira...

01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:32,374
You don't seem to realize that
there are a dozen
two-bit Latino studs out there

01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:34,676
like yourself who would kill
for such a cushy job.

01:13:35,677 --> 01:13:37,513
Christ, Leonardo.

01:13:38,313 --> 01:13:40,182
I was easy-going
about the book,

01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:41,817
I gave you my best clients

01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:44,520
and this is how you reward me.

01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:47,489
Look, Kathy, I got a problem.

01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:51,059
I need to work.
It won't happen again.

01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:54,029
-I can't trust you
-I'm begging you.

01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:55,964
I'll go with anyone
that you say.

01:14:00,002 --> 01:14:04,306
If I give you another chance,
you swear you'll deliver.

01:14:05,507 --> 01:14:07,843
I swear on my family honor.

01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:16,819
Don't disappoint me, Leonardo,
or you're through.

01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:21,156
Thank you. Thank you.

01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:57,926
What are you fiddling with?

01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:00,896
I'm fiddling with this.

01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:05,167
Ahhh! What are you crazy?
Put that away.

01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,969
Well, it'll scare the shit
out of him don't you think?

01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:09,872
Yeah, well it's scaring
the shit out of me.

01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:13,742
-Listen, you just drive, okay?
-You are not using that,
you hear me?

01:15:13,775 --> 01:15:15,210
Listen, we're losing him.
Could you just...

01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:16,812
All right, all right,
we're not losing him.

01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:18,347
He's right there.

01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:13,368
Your cape is lovely.
Have a seat.

01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:22,778
-Is she dressing?
-What for?

01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:24,046
Would you like a drink?

01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:26,481
Er, no, thank you,
I'll just wait.

01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:30,118
Well, I can't wait too long.

01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:35,724
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Oh, hard to get,

01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:36,758
I love it.

01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:38,193
Hey, hey, hey

01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:45,400
I can't believe you.

01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:47,235
What the hell is going on?

01:16:47,736 --> 01:16:48,737
Duck!

01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:54,009
I don't have to kill you.

01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:56,712
Your shame will.

01:17:06,188 --> 01:17:08,490
Well, she's finally asleep.

01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:11,827
It's all your fault.

01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:14,396
You don't know how
to make a man happy

01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:16,431
and now my son has gone crazy.

01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:18,300
It's always the man's fault.

01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:21,637
You and your perfect son.

01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:24,906
I did everything
to please him.

01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:27,275
Anything he wanted.

01:17:28,577 --> 01:17:30,979
And now he humiliates me
like this.

01:17:32,914 --> 01:17:35,784
I've had it.
I have had it.

01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:39,855
The marriage is over.

01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:44,726
Anna, don't throw anything
away until you have
looked inside.

01:17:45,527 --> 01:17:48,196
Mama, I know what I saw.

01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:50,165
You lie, Anna.

01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:52,634
Tell me you lie.

01:17:54,202 --> 01:17:57,773
You lie to ruin my family.

01:17:57,806 --> 01:18:01,543
-Look, why don't we all
just...
-Shut up, shut up!

01:18:01,576 --> 01:18:05,480
-I don't want to hear nothing.
-Hmm, you never do.

01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:09,084
Father Martino
called again, mmm?

01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:14,556
I tell you, I don't
wanna talk to him.
He don't help me.

01:18:14,589 --> 01:18:16,224
(WHISPERS)
Nobody must know.

01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:20,295
Where's my son?

01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:22,564
-He's probably with his lover.
-(NINA GASPS)

01:18:23,765 --> 01:18:27,636
Anna, please, everybody's
in pain. Stop.

01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:31,807
-You see, what happened to
my family since they come?
-Putanas.

01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:34,676
Diavolo!
(SPITTING)

01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:39,648
They probably
put a curse on him.

01:18:39,681 --> 01:18:43,452
Oh poor  sorella, poor Nina.

01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:48,156
Anna, find out what is really
going on with your husband.

01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:50,392
Don't give up so easily.

01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:53,495
Cara, per favore,
do it for Joanne, huh?

01:18:53,528 --> 01:18:58,033
I mean, we got to make
some sense out of all of this
for everyone, huh?

01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:03,605
My son, maybe
he's another Michelangelo.

01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:06,775
-(EXASPERATED CRIES)
-Jesus Christ.

01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:09,711
Look. Why don't we
just hang some stuff
on the Christmas tree?

01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:12,514
-Let's hang some stuff
on the tree.
-Yes.

01:19:47,182 --> 01:19:48,750
Everything okay?

01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:53,655
Them spaghetti and meatballs,
that's our specialty.

01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,805
(I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS
PLAYING)

01:21:43,465 --> 01:21:45,200
Anna, let me explain,

01:21:45,934 --> 01:21:47,402
it's not what you think.

01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:52,140
Anna, Anna.

01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:09,858
I wish for peace for everybody
in this New Year.

01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:17,332
I don't know what to say.

01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:22,771
I don't have anything to give.

01:22:32,147 --> 01:22:33,715
Nardo.

01:22:45,527 --> 01:22:48,096
So, are you finished
with penance?

01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:50,966
My penance is only over
when Anna takes me back.

01:22:50,999 --> 01:22:55,870
Oh, Nardo, Anna cannot
take you back
unless you talk to her.

01:22:57,706 --> 01:22:59,607
She doesn't want
to talk to me.

01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:01,643
How do you know this?

01:23:01,676 --> 01:23:04,346
-I saw it.
-What? You saw what? What?

01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:07,916
Blank. Hate.

01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:10,986
Oh, you saw pain.

01:23:11,019 --> 01:23:13,688
You saw a woman
who feels betrayed.

01:23:13,722 --> 01:23:16,324
Nardo,
you've got to talk to her.

01:23:16,358 --> 01:23:17,959
She loves you.

01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:20,462
I love her.

01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:23,198
Well, then you must
talk to her.

01:23:23,231 --> 01:23:26,301
Show her that
you're no longer a boy.

01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:28,870
That you are a changed man.

01:23:28,903 --> 01:23:32,607
I mean, I do not see the point
of you standing here in a
church feeling guilty

01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,342
and feeling bad.
What's the point?

01:23:35,377 --> 01:23:37,145
What should I do?

01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:40,048
Well, first of all,
clean yourself up

01:23:40,081 --> 01:23:42,884
you look disgusting,
like a bum from the street.

01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:47,856
Look, this is for your life.

01:23:47,889 --> 01:23:51,026
It is not for poker,
you understand me?
No poker.

01:23:51,059 --> 01:23:53,128
-Understand?
-I understand.

01:23:53,161 --> 01:23:54,929
All right. Do you swear?

01:23:58,099 --> 01:23:59,501
I swear to God.

01:24:01,002 --> 01:24:02,670
Do you swear on your baby?

01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,875
I swear on my baby.

01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:11,112
I've done everything I can do.

01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:25,927
(I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS
PLAYING)

01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:09,204
Nardo sent something for you.

01:25:10,472 --> 01:25:12,474
Mama, I don't want it.

01:25:12,507 --> 01:25:15,844
Anna, don't harden your heart.

01:25:17,078 --> 01:25:19,481
Anna, he loves you.

01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:22,183
No, Mama, he doesn't love me.

01:25:24,486 --> 01:25:26,020
He just goes through
the motions.

01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:14,369
Sorry, Cesar.

01:26:39,427 --> 01:26:42,564
Thank God, thank God.

01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:47,669
My son.

01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:51,839
My son.
(CRYING)

01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:56,277
I never believed those stories
Anna said about you.

01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:05,286
-I love you.
-I love you.

01:27:06,621 --> 01:27:10,225
-But I have done wrong.
-Never.

01:27:10,258 --> 01:27:14,462
And you have contributed
as much to this unhappiness
as anyone.

01:27:14,963 --> 01:27:18,333
Me? What?

01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:20,435
I'm asking for
a second chance.

01:27:22,103 --> 01:27:24,806
-But I need you to back me up.
-Back you up?

01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:29,244
Now, that means that things
are gonna have to change.

01:27:31,779 --> 01:27:38,086
Now, I never wanna hear you
say one word

01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:40,555
against my wife

01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:43,524
-or her mother again.
-Leonardo...

01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:47,028
Mama, not one word,

01:27:47,061 --> 01:27:50,365
do you understand? Do you?

01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:53,501
NINA:  Si.

01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:58,573
Anna, everybody
makes mistakes in life.

01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:01,609
Nardo loves you.

01:28:02,944 --> 01:28:04,579
And I know you love him, too.

01:28:06,814 --> 01:28:08,483
Daddy, daddy.

01:28:10,084 --> 01:28:11,419
It's my daddy.

01:28:13,187 --> 01:28:14,355
Daddy.

01:28:15,556 --> 01:28:16,691
Daddy.

-(INHALES DEEPLY)
-Butterfly kiss.

01:28:22,497 --> 01:28:24,132
Yes.

01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:27,068
Come to Granny.

01:28:37,712 --> 01:28:38,913
Welcome home.

Grazie.

Anna,

01:28:58,299 --> 01:28:59,934
please forgive me.

01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:08,609
If there's any more fighting
in this house, I'm leaving.

01:29:08,643 --> 01:29:10,311

(ALL GREETING)

01:29:31,065 --> 01:29:33,701
And Happy New Year,
mia famiglia.

01:29:33,735 --> 01:29:37,805
I want you to meet
Lucia's fiance, Shawn, Shawn.

01:29:39,173 --> 01:29:41,109
ISABELLA: How do you do?
It's nice to meet you at last.

01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:49,083
Nina, can I come in?

01:29:49,117 --> 01:29:51,018
Ah, it's you.

01:29:53,721 --> 01:29:58,059
Nina, there's something
I have to tell you
about Isabella.

01:30:01,262 --> 01:30:02,764
Mama cooks like a crazy...

01:30:03,598 --> 01:30:04,632
Oh!

01:30:06,634 --> 01:30:08,703
We have three cakes and lamb

01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:10,905
and homemade fettuccini.

01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:14,475
A toast to the new couple,

01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:17,078
Lucia and Shawn,

01:30:17,111 --> 01:30:21,149
and to everyone here,
a new beginning.

01:30:21,182 --> 01:30:23,785
-Happy New Year.
-ALL: Happy New Year.

01:30:25,953 --> 01:30:27,522
Happy New Year.

01:30:27,555 --> 01:30:28,790
Buona salute.

01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,235
Uh, Madonna.

01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:42,970
It's a long time
until the spring.

01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:47,308
And all innocent women
are gonna be safe from you.

01:30:49,076 --> 01:30:52,613
Yo, Mike, Mikey!
When do you think
Nardo's coming around?

01:30:52,647 --> 01:30:55,349
I don't know.
I think he's gonna hole up
with his family right now.

01:30:55,383 --> 01:30:57,185
How are ya?

01:30:58,319 --> 01:30:59,821
Hey, boys,

01:30:59,854 --> 01:31:01,823
let's go to that pizzeria
and I'll buy you a slice
on the house.

01:31:01,856 --> 01:31:03,291
I don't think so.

01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:07,094
What, my pizza's
not good enough for you?

01:31:07,128 --> 01:31:09,730
No, Angelo, you're not
good enough for us.

01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:15,903
-Madonna...
-Oh, look at that fur.
(WHISTLING)

01:31:15,937 --> 01:31:17,271
Must be a rich widow.

01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:18,673
How do you know
she's a rich widow?

01:31:18,706 --> 01:31:21,142
Oh, it's my job to know,
Mikey.

01:31:25,713 --> 01:31:28,649
It's still Winter out,
but inside...

01:31:28,683 --> 01:31:32,453
I feel like, I feel like
the heat of Spring.

01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:33,988
PHILIPO: Alfredo,
you're desperate.
