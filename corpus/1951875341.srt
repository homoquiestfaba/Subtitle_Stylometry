1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:11,967
<i>Oh, what a tangled web we weave</i>
<i>When first we practice to deceive.</i>

2
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:16,081
<i>That's Bill Shakespeare.</i>
<i>He knew it 500 years ago.</i>

3
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:19,581
<i>The art of deception has</i>
<i>created wars, destroyed kingdoms...</i>

4
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:22,516
<i>... brought down the world's</i>
<i>greatest empires.</i>

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,921
<i>And it was a crude web of lies</i>
<i>that I wove that led to my downfall.</i>

6
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:30,028
<i>See that guy there?</i>
<i>That's me, Johnny Grand.</i>

7
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,426
<i>Not so long ago, I had it all.</i>

8
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:36,695
<i>Big house in the suburbs,</i>
<i>beautiful wife, plenty of dough.</i>

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,701
<i>The American dream.</i>

10
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:43,103
<i>And this is the story</i>
<i>of how I lost it all.</i>

11
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:05,063
<i>Meet my friend Carlos,</i>
<i>ex-client, another jailbird.</i>

12
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:09,065
<i>Only this one has just flown the coop</i>
<i>with a little help from yours truly.</i>

13
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,601
<i>I went to law school</i>
<i>with the right intentions...</i>

14
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:14,433
<i>... but I got lost</i>
<i>somewhere along the line.</i>

15
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,743
<i>Felonious Spinks, friend of Carlos.</i>

16
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,214
<i>Sometimes lover,</i>
<i>sometimes whipping boy.</i>

17
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:28,479
<i>Plays her almost as well</i>
<i>as he plays the saxophone.</i>

18
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,787
<i>This is my wife, Jane.</i>
<i>She likes it on top.</i>

19
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,929
<i>Always has to be in control.</i>

20
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,359
<i>Always did.</i>

21
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,225
Johnny.

22
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,759
Johnny.

23
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,369
Earth to Johnny.

24
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,432
What? What did you say? What?

25
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,240
We were making love and you just
drifted off in your own world again.

26
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:59,181
- Who are you fantasizing about?
- Concentrating, trying not to come.

27
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:02,752
I want you inside me.

28
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,660
<i>This is my best friend, Bill.</i>

29
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:11,126
<i>Bill fucked up. He trusted me.</i>

30
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,763
Come on, honey, I don't want
to be late again.

31
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:17,300
I haven't even put on
my goddamn makeup yet.

32
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,131
Can't you put it on in the car?

33
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,364
I don't want to be
Mr. and Mrs. Tardy.

34
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:25,341
All right, you know what?
Don't start with me.

35
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,639
Jesus Christ.

36
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:33,442
<i>This is Olivia, my ex-girlfriend</i>
<i>and the love of my life.</i>

37
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,185
<i>Next week she's marrying Bill.</i>

38
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,483
What are you doing? Let me go.

39
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,285
Let go.

40
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,237
What the hell was that?

41
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,474
I want a kid.

42
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,341
- I don't.
- Too bad, I'm ovulating.

43
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,208
You said you were on the pill.

44
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,147
I lied.

45
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,388
Did you just baby-rape me?

46
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:20,394
<i>Meet Gigi LaRush, exotic dancer.</i>
<i>Very gifted.</i>

47
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:21,864
<i>I plea-bargained my way...</i>

48
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:26,165
<i>... out of her third solicitation offense</i>
<i>by setting the judge up with a hooker.</i>

49
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,170
<i>Gigi owes me.</i>

50
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,178
Goddamn sink.

51
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,382
<i>Right now, Gigi's biggest problem</i>
<i>is her plumbing.</i>

52
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,246
<i>But by midnight it'll be murder.</i>

53
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,293
<i>This is Enrique.</i>
<i>He thinks God is on his side.</i>

54
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,762
<i>He kidnaps young girls,</i>
<i>sells them for profit.</i>

55
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:58,062
<i>A long time ago he left Carlos</i>
<i>for dead.</i>

56
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:01,705
<i>His past will catch up to him</i>
<i>before the night is through.</i>

57
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,866
<i>And this is my father, dear old Dad.</i>

58
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,774
<i>A master of deception</i>
<i>and a tower of corruption.</i>

59
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,312
<i>He's the perfect Republican.</i>

60
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:12,609
<i>He doesn't know it yet,</i>
<i>but he's in for a fall.</i>

61
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,119
The boat leaves in the morning.

62
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,919
Bring me another one tonight.

63
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,788
Just like the last one.

64
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,389
A cheerleader.

65
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,765
Nice and young.

66
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,295
A teenybopper.

67
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,335
<i>Introducing Tammy Snow.</i>

68
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:35,735
<i>All she wants is to follow</i>
<i>her dreams.</i>

69
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,311
<i>These are the players,</i>
<i>this is the night...</i>

70
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,252
<i>... of the grand tragedy</i>
<i>that changed my life.</i>

71
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:54,253
<i>And this is how it all began.</i>

72
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,492
Who were you thinking about?

73
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:58,759
When?

74
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:02,833
When we were making love
and you were lost in some world.

75
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,300
- Who were you fantasizing about?
- I told you...

76
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,632
...I wasn't fantasizing,
I was concentrating.

77
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,968
You fantasize about other women,
you said so.

78
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,010
Yeah, all men do that,
that's not the point.

79
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,044
I'd hope I'd be enough.

80
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,205
Don't take it personally,
none of us are.

81
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,551
What was the point
of getting married?

82
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:23,815
Marriage serves a perfectly useful
and reasonable sociological function.

83
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,184
Well, that's romantic.

84
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,283
It's necessary, what separates us
from the animals.

85
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,223
You're troubled, do you know that?

86
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:33,297
You need to take one of
those mood medications or something.

87
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:36,898
Why do you always invalidate my
point by suggesting I'm unbalanced?

88
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,571
- Well, aren't you?
- Who isn't unbalanced?

89
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,367
You're not the poster child
for mental health yourself.

90
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:46,508
Oh, so now I'm crazy.

91
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,978
See, manipulation. I'm damned if I do,
I'm damned if I don't.

92
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,140
That's how you work,
how women work.

93
00:05:58,224 --> 00:05:59,486
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Manny.

94
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,524
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hey.

95
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,595
- It's Mr. Grand.
<i>- Hey, Mr. Grand, good to talk to you.</i>

96
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,255
Good to talk to you too.

97
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,692
Remember that conversation we had
last week?

98
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,530
<i>- About the lamb?</i>
- That's right.

99
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,172
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>
- You score for me tonight...

100
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,104
...you got a thousand big ones
coming your way.

101
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,767
<i>- A thousand?</i>
- That's right, a grand.

102
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,573
- No problem?
<i>- No, no problem.</i>

103
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,079
That's what I like to hear.

104
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,910
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Okey-doke.

105
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,177
<i>Yeah, no problem, bye.</i>

106
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,578
Yes, dear.

107
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,748
I know what time it is.

108
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:34,552
<i>And this is my mother.</i>

109
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,719
<i>The day she filed for divorce,</i>
<i>she fell down the stairs.</i>

110
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:42,732
<i>- Dad claims it was an accident.</i>
- Till death do us part.

111
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,468
Well, now, that should
just about do it.

112
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,405
What seems to be the trouble?

113
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,810
Well, now, from what I could deduce
of the situation...

114
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,781
...your drainage system was
entangled with a prophylactic.

115
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,921
The good news is that your sink
was never the problem.

116
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,889
Here it was with your garbage
disposal all along. And this...

117
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,720
This little fellow right here.

118
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,196
Why, he was gumming up
all the works.

119
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,158
Listen, Jim...

120
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:19,827
...l'm a little low on cash right now.
Is there anything I can get...

121
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:24,334
...anything I can do for you?

122
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,637
I could use a glass of milk.

123
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,781
I don't have milk,
just cream for coffee.

124
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,145
That'd be just dandy.

125
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,015
- A coffee?
- No, just the cream, thanks.

126
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:39,487
- Just a glass of cream?
- Oh, boy, that'd be just dandy.

127
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,092
<i>Hey, sk8er boy.</i>

128
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,820
<i>Webcam's still out, huh?</i>

129
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:47,363
<i>You said we were gonna hang on</i>
<i>Thursday, and then you never called.</i>

130
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:52,027
<i>What's the matter? Mommy</i>
<i>and Daddy won't let you out to play?</i>

131
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,885
<i>- Tonight? Okay, you're on.</i>
- You little cutie-pie.

132
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,718
<i>You'd better be there. Hope you're</i>
<i>as good as you sound.</i>

133
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:16,157
- You know downtown?
<i>- Like the back of my litter box.</i>

134
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:21,324
You are a bad little kitty.

135
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:25,832
I live just east
of the convention center...

136
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,338
...at 8th Street and...

137
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:37,705
Goddamn useless piece of shit.

138
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,783
How's your cream, Jim?

139
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,754
- Yummy.
- You know, Jim...

140
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:49,520
...l'm running a little late
for work tonight, so maybe...

141
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,163
...just this once we could
take a rain check?

142
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,725
I know what you do for work.

143
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,870
You don't exactly have to "clock in."

144
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,097
I'm real sorry, but I don't take
rain checks.

145
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,936
I expect full payment upon completion
of each and every job I do.

146
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,373
And you know that.

147
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,849
Yeah, I know.

148
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,815
I'm sorry, it was wrong of me to ask.

149
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,010
What would you like?

150
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,823
A spit and a polish
would do the trick.

151
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,687
Okay.

152
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:34,536
Yes, baby. Thattagirl.

153
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,409
Get in the car, Carnelito,
you're driving.

154
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:51,883
Where's the girl?

155
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,549
I thought you said you were
getting me laid tonight.

156
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,594
Hold your horses, she's in the trunk.

157
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,960
- In the trunk?
- In the trunk.

158
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,359
Well, is she hot?

159
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:09,468
She's a real animal.

160
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,641
What are you doing?

161
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,809
- What do you mean?
- Fucking rush me...

162
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,511
...telling me how late we are...

163
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:26,249
...and you let that guy in front
like we had all the time in the world.

164
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,450
Jesus,
what difference does one car make?

165
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,927
Oh, that is what everyone says, Bill.

166
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:36,592
I mean, one car turns into another
car, and another, and another.

167
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,301
- That's not what this is about.
- What is it about, Bill?

168
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,602
Johnny and Jane.

169
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:45,937
You don't wanna go.

170
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:49,206
I am having... I'm having a hard time
dealing with them right now.

171
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,349
What? Why? Wha... I don't get it.

172
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:54,179
What, what?
You just suddenly outgrown them?

173
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:58,517
Yeah, kind of like Puff the Dragon,
and little Jackie Paper, you know?

174
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:01,023
It's just time to move on.

175
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:08,132
What the fuck was that about?

176
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,860
That jerk almost took off
the front end of our car.

177
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,699
Well, then, don't shout at me,
it is not my fault.

178
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,807
I'm not shouting at you!

179
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,169
I'm just frustrated.

180
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,811
Then don't let him get away with it,
you know?

181
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,674
God, do something about it.

182
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,873
- Like what?
- I don't know, something. Anything.

183
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,645
God. Give him the finger.
Tell him to fuck off.

184
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,381
Broadside him, whatever.
Just don't do nothing.

185
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:37,921
Come on, you fucking wetbacks!
You fucking lowlife losers!

186
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,190
Come on! Hey.

187
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,527
You trying to get us killed?

188
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,397
Have you ever heard of road rage?

189
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,571
The guy could have a gun.

190
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,868
You are always so careful.
Just so fucking predictable.

191
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:56,778
I mean, what in the hell
are you so angry about?

192
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,211
I don't know.

193
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,615
You know, I wish you'd figure it out.

194
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,779
Because we're getting married
next week...

195
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,187
...and I don't want to spend
the rest of my life defending myself.

196
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,921
<i>Wait, we can't fulfill each other's</i>
<i>every need. We marry who we marry.</i>

197
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,292
<i>Most people don't change.</i>

198
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,195
<i>Men and women will never</i>
<i>truly understand each other.</i>

199
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,131
We can try to make the best of it.

200
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,602
We can't possibly be everything
to each other...

201
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,298
...all the time.
- Hence your desire for other women.

202
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,567
That's not my desire.

203
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,804
That's just the man in me.
That's the nature of being a man.

204
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,880
What exactly is that? Do tell.

205
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,542
I'm just saying that I can't change
my animal desires. You understand?

206
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,711
That's the point
I'm trying to get across.

207
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,814
Good point.
I'm gonna get off this roller coaster.

208
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,425
I have potato salad to make.

209
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:52,836
Yo, Carlos, what's up, baby?

210
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:56,235
Your man is home,
and he gots presents for you.

211
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:01,470
You getting all clean
and fresh for Daddy, aren't you?

212
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,114
You got everything we need?

213
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,774
Yeah, I got the hot dogs,
the beer, the T-shirt, the jeans.

214
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:10,683
I even stopped over there at
Trashy Lancey's Lingerie on Flower...

215
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:14,622
...and picked up
some of the finest finery fit for a ho.

216
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,489
You're the pimp.

217
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,493
- I know, baby.
- You got the weapons?

218
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,292
I got everything in the trunk.
What's up with Enrique?

219
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,332
First of the month,
tonight's the night.

220
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:27,598
Tonight? Man,
you done had my ass running all day.

221
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:31,599
All right, I know how to do this.
I'm gonna take me a nap.

222
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:35,144
Get up off your lazy black ass.
It is D-day.

223
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,841
Hey, man, look.
Do not be bitch-slapping me like that.

224
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:42,647
You want a fucking life, huh?
You want the bling-bling?

225
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,155
You know it's not even about that.
We've had this conversation before.

226
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,816
I know you running the show,
and you got the booty...

227
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,555
...but don't ever treat me like some
lackey-ass nigger along for the ride.

228
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:55,723
- I treat you like a nigger?
- You call me "nigger" all the time.

229
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:59,200
Your black friends call each
other nigger. "Hey, nigger."

230
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:00,998
Don't bring my friends into this.

231
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,199
That's our culture
and that's our way of relating.

232
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,901
- You know that.
- That's called Ebonics, man. Right?

233
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,012
You need to check yourself.

234
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,741
Somebody's going to get hurt
and it ain't gonna be me.

235
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,750
- You going to hurt me, bitch?
- Oh, now I'm your bitch, huh?

236
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,014
- Yeah, you're my bitch.
- All right, I'm a show you a bitch.

237
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,171
- What's wrong?
- I can't, Kip.

238
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,574
Well, sure you can.

239
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,681
Stop.

240
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,443
I know I can, but I don't want to.

241
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,378
If you loved me, you'd do it with me.

242
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,113
If you loved me...

243
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,283
...I mean if you really loved me
in your heart of hearts, you'd wait.

244
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,725
You wouldn't push me.

245
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:01,430
Push you? We've been going out
for almost three weeks.

246
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,694
I already gave you more time than
other boys at school would've.

247
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,270
I mean,
we're gonna be seniors next year.

248
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,533
- I know.
- We're moving into adulthood. It's time.

249
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:13,234
Are you saying I should just do it?

250
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,779
You know, "it," because it's time?

251
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:21,413
- God tells you when it's time.
- Now, what are you talking about?

252
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,579
Take puberty, for example.
That's what God does to our bodies...

253
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,122
...so we know we're ready.

254
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:30,460
- God did it to us?
- Yes, in a manner of speaking.

255
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:33,154
If God made us,
then he must have designed us.

256
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,800
A girl can have her period,
she can have babies.

257
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:39,961
And once a boy can pop his rock,
he's got all the ammunition he needs.

258
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,006
Can I have that smoke?

259
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,408
It just figures that...

260
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:49,570
...if God wanted us to wait
until we were grown to have sex...

261
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,482
...then he would have made us
that way.

262
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,810
I want to make something of myself,
Kip.

263
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,580
God, I know it sounds crazy...

264
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:00,919
...but I feel like I'm special somehow,
you know.

265
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,186
And I don't want
to go getting pregnant...

266
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,626
...before I get the chance
to follow my dreams.

267
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:08,591
I don't want to ruin your dreams.

268
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,466
I just want us to feel good.

269
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,377
Better get your hands off her, boy.

270
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:23,845
Mr. Snow, it ain't what it looks like.
I was helping her with her...

271
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,644
I know what you were
helping her with.

272
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,446
Get on down here, little girl.

273
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:31,454
Hey, I'm not a little girl
anymore, Daddy.

274
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,382
Get your ass down here now!

275
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,958
Hurry up.

276
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,495
I hope you're proud of yourself.

277
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:50,039
Smoking cigarettes and slutting it up,
right here under my own roof.

278
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,336
Hey, I ain't no slut.

279
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,378
- You, I'm going to kick your ass.
- Daddy, leave him alone.

280
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,344
You dirty little dog. Get ready.

281
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,782
- Daddy, stop.
- This is it. I've had enough of you.

282
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:06,921
Goddamn it.
Yeah, you'd better run, you little turd.

283
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,652
About to get
the ass-whipping of your life, boy.

284
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:18,529
Kip! Kip! Kip!

285
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,331
Daddy!

286
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,838
Get back here, little girl.

287
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:25,566
Get...

288
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,178
- Hey. Come in.
- Hi, hi.

289
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,751
- How you doing?
- Good, good.

290
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,616
- Hi. Yeah.
- Yeah.

291
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,516
Hey, so where's Johnny?

292
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:43,559
Surprise!

293
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,331
Surprise, honey.

294
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,395
I've missed you.

295
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,595
- Yeah, me too.
- Oh, I'm so happy for you.

296
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,763
You are gonna make
such a beautiful bride.

297
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:58,774
Hey, wake up, buddy.
You're signing your death certificate.

298
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:02,072
The end of sex. The end of freedom.
It's all downhill from here.

299
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,579
You should know.
After all, you know everything.

300
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,617
You're catching on. Does this mean
it's all over between us?

301
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,949
Stop, all right?
Get your breath off my face.

302
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,750
You need to tame your beast.

303
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,256
- Bill, my man.
- Yeah?

304
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:18,089
You are one lucky lady.
You got yourself a keeper right here.

305
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,753
Oh, I love you so much.

306
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,093
We gotta get out of here.
Are we ready to go?

307
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,963
- This estrogen's gonna kill me.
- Where you guys going?

308
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,298
Boys' night out.
Bachelor party, you know...

309
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,338
- Bachelor party? I told you...
- Surprise.

310
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,499
I told you
I don't want a bachelor party.

311
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,736
Now, Bill,
you can't go against tradition.

312
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:37,678
This is your last opportunity to enter
that free world with your balls intact.

313
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,681
Well, thank you very much.
My balls will always be intact.

314
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:44,117
We took a lot of time to make sure
that you two had a night...

315
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,156
...that you would never forget.
So stick with the program.

316
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:51,194
Besides, we have plans of our own
that don't include you.

317
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:52,988
- What plans?
- Bye.

318
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:56,100
You're pussing out on me, Bill.
Don't puss out on me.

319
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:59,499
We've been through a lot together.
This is a big night.

320
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:03,266
I just don't want to disgrace
the whole point of the celebration.

321
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,376
- Being what?
- Our marriage.

322
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,375
What is the matter with you?

323
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,878
I seem to recall
at Phil's bachelor party...

324
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:13,882
...you were wrangling a dime out of
a stripper's ass with your canine teeth.

325
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,110
That doesn't count.

326
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,448
You know how I used to get
when I got wasted.

327
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:21,115
- You were the life of the fucking party.
- You know what? That wasn't me.

328
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:24,160
That was the booze, the blow.
That was before I got married.

329
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,854
- You're not married.
- Engaged. You know what I mean.

330
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,865
I don't know what you mean.
That's the point of this thing.

331
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:32,299
We're celebrating
the last of your singledom.

332
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:35,201
I will guarantee the girls
know how to have a send-off.

333
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:38,810
They make us out to be the animals,
but they want it worse than we do.

334
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,411
Indiscriminate seed,
it's in their biology.

335
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,741
I saw something
on <i>Animal Planet</i> about that.

336
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,644
They go into heat like dogs.

337
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,808
- Like bitches, right?
- That's right, Phil.

338
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:51,422
It's a proven theory, accepted
in the majority of scientific circles.

339
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,549
Men want sex, women need the seed.
And if you can't keep...

340
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:59,094
...the high, hard one coming,
she's going to be looking elsewhere.

341
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:02,597
- Well, I got no problems there.
- Yeah, you're a regular stud, are you?

342
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:05,259
Olivia and I make love every night,
no matter what.

343
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,671
Bullshit, you do not.
Give me a fucking break.

344
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,571
No couple makes love every night.

345
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,905
You got a better chance
to win the lottery...

346
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,072
...and get struck by lightning
on your way to cash the ticket.

347
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,048
Hate to burst your cynical bubble,
Johnny, but, yes, we do.

348
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,553
Olivia and I make love every night.

349
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,590
- What about when you're fighting?
- Doesn't matter.

350
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,956
What about if she's got a cold
or she's got a bronchial infection?

351
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:34,724
At the first sign of a sniffle,
I cut Jane off from all physical contact.

352
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,063
I don't catch cooties to prove
I love her. I'm sensitive enough...

353
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,068
...not to bump uglies
when she's sick.

354
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,297
You always do this.

355
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:45,374
You jump all over one trivial thing
and just run it into the ground.

356
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,068
It's what I do, I'm a litigator.

357
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,044
- I'm just going to turn around.
- Wait, you can't go back.

358
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:51,443
Why not?

359
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:55,018
The girls are back there,
and they got it going on.

360
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,014
What are they doing?

361
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,956
That is one funky-ass,
psychedelic sunset.

362
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:11,459
You should see the sunsets in Cuba.

363
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,188
You remember Cuba?

364
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,994
You never forget your first sunset.

365
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,136
So how'd you...?
How'd you get out of there?

366
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:19,531
How'd you get out of Cuba?

367
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:23,971
My mother. She sold her sex
on the streets of Havana...

368
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:28,211
...to get money to send me
and my aunts to the States.

369
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,239
She said she would come,
but she never did.

370
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,809
And then we came to Miami,
and we meet a man.

371
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:38,822
Enrique.

372
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,723
And he take us here.

373
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:43,919
He was a bad man.

374
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:47,257
Made us promises,
made a whore of my aunt...

375
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:50,026
<i>... and when he tried to do it to me,</i>
<i>I escaped.</i>

376
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:54,036
<i>And he found me.</i>
<i>And him and Spence...</i>

377
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,930
<i>... they did bad things to me.</i>

378
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,341
That's what all this firepower's for?

379
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,610
Wait, you said something
about some money.

380
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:11,415
You said we were going
to be breaking the bank tonight.

381
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:16,221
We are. Enrique and his brother,
they're the ones with the money.

382
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,297
It's a full moon.

383
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:28,235
And the full moon
brings out the lunatics.

384
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:36,110
Lunatics!

385
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,687
My Yankee Doodle Dandy.

386
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:55,324
Who is it?

387
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,766
Mr. Grand, it's me, Manny.

388
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,599
Oh, Manny.

389
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,468
Come in.

390
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,672
What the hell is that?

391
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:13,147
It's a surprise.

392
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,752
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da what?

393
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:21,324
It's a lamb.

394
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:25,657
It's a sheep. You want to tell me
what it's doing in my apartment?

395
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,456
You told me to bring you a lamb.

396
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,168
That was a metaphor.

397
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,168
What's a metaphor?

398
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:36,796
A comparison
not using "like" or "as."

399
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,466
By "lamb" I meant "girl."

400
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,770
A young girl.

401
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:43,938
It's just that...
You showed me that movie. I figured...

402
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,879
I mean, you said people get off on...
What you call it?

403
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,178
Bestiality?

404
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:50,981
Yeah. Exactly.
So we brought the lamb.

405
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:57,787
So you want me to film you
having your way with it?

406
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:01,857
Not me. Julio here's gonna do it.

407
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:05,969
So you want me to pay you
to film your one-eyed friend...

408
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:07,866
...fornicating with a dead sheep.

409
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,406
Necrophilia meets bestiality.

410
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:14,807
She ain't dead, she's sleeping.

411
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:17,812
Watch.

412
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:22,315
- Get back here, you wooly bitch.
- Hey. Watch the table.

413
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:24,045
Get that thing out of here.

414
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:27,988
Get him out of here!
Get that thing out of my apartment.

415
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,923
Watch the... Watch the table.

416
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,792
- Goddamn it. Goddamn. Stop it!
- Get him, Julio.

417
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,699
Get him out of here, goddamn it.
Grab him!

418
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,565
- Yes. Yeah.
- Hit it.

419
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:50,437
Clean hit. No blood.
She's sleeping like a baby.

420
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:53,243
And when she comes to,
she'll be easy as pie.

421
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:57,286
We just prop her up
and Julio buries the meat puppet.

422
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:59,855
What the fuck?

423
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:06,726
So what? What does it matter
if it's a he or a she?

424
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,623
I ain't no homo.

425
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:13,360
You would fuck a girl sheep,
but not a boy sheep.

426
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:16,769
- I would not fuck a boy.
- But you would fuck a sheep.

427
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:19,410
Gentlemen, could you please
curb your language?

428
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,809
My lovely wife is right there,
and she may seem out of it...

429
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:26,849
...but believe me,
she doesn't miss a fucking thing.

430
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:47,462
Manny,
could you come here a second?

431
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:56,178
Would you tell your one-eyed friend
to wait in the car?

432
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:59,748
Look, Julio, why don't you go on down
and wait in the car?

433
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:02,785
Oh, and, Julio,
take the sheep with you.

434
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,683
Sit down, Manny.

435
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,254
Now, Manny...

436
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,255
...I like you.

437
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,964
You have imagination.

438
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:20,093
But if we are going to work together,
it is imperative that you understand...

439
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:23,832
...the delicate balance
of supply and demand.

440
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,842
Eighty percent of the population
like the kind of things...

441
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:29,003
...that they find
on the Playboy Channel.

442
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:33,810
Sexy, sometimes even a little rough,
but always romantic.

443
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:39,317
There's about another 15 to 17
percent that like the nasty shit.

444
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:43,018
S&M, bondage, role-playing,
strap-ons.

445
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:47,324
They like it somewhat sick,
but they like it done tastefully.

446
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:52,163
The other three to five percent,
the clientele that I cater to...

447
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,396
...they want a rush.

448
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:58,872
They want it illegal,
they want it nastier than nasty.

449
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:03,071
This audience is comprised mostly
of men, as you might have guessed.

450
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:06,649
Men who have
their primal roots firmly in hand.

451
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:12,814
But even they, God bless
their pagan souls, have their limits.

452
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,487
No sheep?

453
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:23,157
No man wants to watch
another man fuck a sheep.

454
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,065
- This is something I'd never realized.
- I'm not surprised.

455
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,837
And what do you think my clientele
would like to see upon that screen?

456
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:38,776
- A beautiful woman?
- No, Manny.

457
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:42,544
A girl. A beautiful girl.

458
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,588
Like Hollywood, right?

459
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:49,352
They make all that sick shit
with them teen bitches...

460
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:50,926
...because that's what sells.

461
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:54,361
That's right, Manny.
We're talking box office here.

462
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:08,412
Oh, now, that's
what I'm talking about, baby.

463
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,548
Oh, shut up.

464
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:13,283
Why don't you put
the toilet seat down, huh?

465
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:16,215
Don't start with that shit.
Why don't you ever put it up?

466
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:19,083
Every time I go to take a piss,
the toilet seat is down.

467
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,248
- And?
- Why should I put it down for you...

468
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,088
...when you don't have the decency
to put it up for me?

469
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,730
R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

470
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:30,595
That's why you open the door.
I am woman, hear me roar.

471
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,999
Yeah, yeah,
well, check this out, woman...

472
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:36,231
...if each one of us
took responsibility for our own shit...

473
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:37,669
...we'd be better off.

474
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:42,774
- You got everything?
- I am locked and loaded, baby.

475
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,365
All right, come here.

476
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:08,105
Hey, Courtney, three Cuervo.

477
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:09,766
Check out those hooters.

478
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:13,809
Oh, damn, that right there...
That's the good shit, right there.

479
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,843
- That's silicone.
- Silicone?

480
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:18,175
Silicone,
that stands up like good soldiers.

481
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,510
No, that was a crime
when they outlawed that.

482
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:22,942
- Tits?
- No, the silicone...

483
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:25,021
...the good stuff, the hard shit.

484
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,221
You know, the saline?
The saline sucks.

485
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,792
Saline is like a baggie full of water,
you know?

486
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,986
I could buy a goldfish
if I wanted that.

487
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,063
I never thought about it like that.

488
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:41,195
- Well, what do you think about, Phil?
- Killing Cindy. Where I'd bury her body.

489
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,073
- Other stuff.
- All right.

490
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:46,142
I don't know why a woman
would do that to her body.

491
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:49,806
- What don't you understand?
- It's gotta hurt.

492
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:55,209
- Maybe she wants bigger tits.
- Yeah, is it the... He gets it.

493
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,013
I think you're on to something.

494
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:01,750
Or maybe she's a victim
of media-driven propaganda.

495
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:05,589
Maybe she thinks unless she has huge
tits she's not going to be good enough.

496
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:09,096
- Some aesthetic they can't live up to...
- "Blah, blah, blah, victim..."

497
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:12,532
Listen, you know, she's got fake tits.
You've got money.

498
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,569
You think that that
puts you in control?

499
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:17,708
End of the night, she goes home
with the tits and the money.

500
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,901
What do you go home with? Him.

501
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:24,076
Look at her. Look at her.

502
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,945
You see those tits?
You think those are tits?

503
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:30,382
No, that's not tits.
Meal ticket. Meal ticket.

504
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,456
The bigger the tits,
the better the prospects.

505
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:36,286
You get rid of those hooters,
what is she?

506
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,089
- Hooter-less?
- Yes, exactly, she's hooter-less.

507
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,528
Would you go to a place
called Hooter-less? No.

508
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,365
If they have a good buffet,
it could be popular.

509
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:53,209
I am so wasted. I gotta... We gotta go.
I'm wasted.

510
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:55,876
Why are we following the little dog...

511
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,413
...when the big dog
has all the money in the safe?

512
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,074
The little dog's got keys
to the big dog's apartment.

513
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,813
- Big dog's got big guns.
- That makes sense.

514
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:08,481
- So where is he going?
- The cash drop-off at the bus station.

515
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,820
- We gonna do him at the station?
- Come on.

516
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:14,089
- You think I put on this outfit for you?
- Yeah, doll, you know.

517
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,962
Come on, come on,
business before pleasure, let's go.

518
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:25,600
It's not easy at a time like this to
put into words what it means to me...

519
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,245
...to have the privilege
of knowing you.

520
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:31,314
To know that there will always
be someone there...

521
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:33,507
...no matter how tough times are.

522
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:38,815
Someone you can share your deepest,
most intimate feelings...

523
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:45,156
...fantasies, your disappointments,
your deepest desires.

524
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:50,367
Someone you could trust
with your life.

525
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:53,436
Someone like Olivia.

526
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:57,499
To my best friend.

527
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,108
Cheers.

528
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:25,030
Hey, boozie, let's get a chilidog.

529
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,666
Is he all right? Are you all right?

530
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,638
- You wanna pull over?
- I am seriously fucked up right now.

531
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,369
Here. How about a pick-me-up?

532
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:38,709
You really are the fucking devil,
you know that?

533
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:44,788
Let's just say
we run in the same crowd.

534
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,161
Attaboy, Billy.

535
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:53,491
Just like riding a bicycle.

536
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:58,933
Fuck.

537
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,376
- Why are we stopping?
- Food.

538
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,515
Soak up the alcohol before
we take you back. Come on, Phil.

539
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:13,775
- I'm gonna stay here.
- You don't want food?

540
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:17,352
- Yeah, I'll take some.
- Come on, I'm not carrying it myself.

541
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:20,958
Hey. Hey, you can't leave
the car started here.

542
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,093
Hey, you can't...

543
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,444
Can I do something for you?

544
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:49,711
That's funny. I was just about
to ask you the same thing.

545
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:52,720
Well, can you tell me what
the fuck you're doing in my car?

546
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:57,088
Surprise. You've won a trip for two
to the sleazy motel of your choice.

547
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:00,128
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I bought her for you.

548
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:02,892
You can do whatever you want to her.
Right, sweetheart?

549
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,160
Anything your little heart desires.

550
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:08,065
- I can't do that. I'm practically married.
- You're not.

551
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:12,107
Now, will you go easy on yourself?
Go out and have some fun?

552
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,068
- Hey.
- Taxi.

553
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:16,873
- Where the fuck are you guys going?
- Have fun.

554
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,450
I'm too wasted for this bullshit.

555
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,896
Everything is going to be just fine.

556
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,812
Is that a lamb, or is that a lamb?

557
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,949
That looks like
a very unhappy little lamb.

558
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:55,711
- Maybe she's lost.
- Maybe she's lonely.

559
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,187
Maybe she wants to be a star.
Come on, flip a U-ey.

560
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,419
- What?
- Flip a U-ey, <i>ése,</i> a U-ey.

561
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:14,029
Hey, are you okay?

562
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,208
- I'm fine.
- You don't look so fine.

563
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:22,471
I'm just a little upset, I guess.

564
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:24,845
Hey, are you a model?

565
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,708
What?

566
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:31,746
You know, one of those girls
in the magazines.

567
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:36,254
No, not really. Not yet, I guess.

568
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:40,419
Hey, I happen to have a friend.
He's a bigtime photographer.

569
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,862
He's always looking for new talent,
you know?

570
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,867
- Fresh faces.
- Really?

571
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:51,168
Yeah, he's hot. As a matter of fact,
he's looking for models right now.

572
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,867
And I think you'd be just right.

573
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,378
Wow, that would be amazing.

574
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,947
Do you have an address...

575
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:01,380
...where we could send you
some information?

576
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:05,750
Not right now. I ran away.

577
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:11,225
Well, I could just walk you over there,
see what he thinks.

578
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:15,527
Well, it's just that
I don't really know y'all.

579
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,136
And I mean, I'm sure you're fine
and everything, you seem real nice.

580
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:23,740
- But I kind of...
- I ain't gonna bite you or nothing.

581
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,976
What have you got to lose?
You could be the next Cindy Caulfield.

582
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:29,612
Who knows?

583
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:36,315
Okay, all right. Why not, right?

584
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:47,159
- Hey, you want a date?
- Not interested.

585
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:49,595
- You don't like the way I look, huh?
- Fuck off.

586
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:54,227
Or what? You a faggot, huh? What?
You don't think I'm sexy enough?

587
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:56,430
Pretty enough? Or young enough?

588
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,768
I can get them young for you,
real young.

589
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:06,640
- How young?
- Oh, you like the babies, huh?

590
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:09,843
That's right.
I got a boss who likes them young.

591
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:13,990
His name Enrique?
Your boss, Enrique.

592
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:17,093
- You know my boss?
- In the biblical way.

593
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:18,751
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah.

594
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:22,931
He gangbanged me
with a couple of his friends.

595
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,160
You know what?
You look like one of those guys.

596
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:29,970
I don't know what kind of game it is
that you're playing, huh?

597
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:34,840
But you better walk real fast
before I put a bullet in your head.

598
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,874
Keep walking, bitch.

599
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,879
I'm walking. I'm walking.
Look, I'm walking.

600
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:43,518
Drop your piece, motherfucker.

601
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,079
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah.

602
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:48,353
Fuck.

603
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:51,859
You fucking, stupid-ass nigger.

604
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:12,412
- Hey, driver, pull over at the corner.
- Whoa, where you going?

605
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:14,516
I got business to take care of.

606
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,984
If you're gonna pick up your wife
don't mention anything about...

607
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:20,419
Whoa, what are you thinking?
I'm going home.

608
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:22,489
I gots me a date with Miss May.

609
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,719
Here you go.
Take him home, keep the change.

610
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:27,557
Oh, thank you very much, very kind.

611
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,527
Forward ho.

612
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,398
Oh, God, I can't understand anything.

613
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,699
God, please.

614
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:42,045
That was not my cocaine.

615
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,910
I don't know her, I was...
I was just giving her a ride.

616
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,245
You gotta believe me.

617
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:53,289
Shut up.
2-Sam-4-3 requesting backup.

618
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:57,154
It's my bachelor party. Haven't you
ever had a bachelor party?

619
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:00,157
You have to listen to me,
I can explain this.

620
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:06,769
Officer, please,
this is going to ruin me.

621
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:08,700
I'm getting married next week.

622
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:13,236
Officer, please?

623
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,446
What are you going to do now, <i>puta?</i>

624
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:25,281
What the...?

625
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:32,992
Oh, Jesus.

626
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:36,424
Holy shit.

627
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:40,336
That hooker has a gun.

628
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:46,274
- What are you doing?
- This hooker's got a gun.

629
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,969
- Let's go.
- You can't take a cop's gun.

630
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:50,477
Shut up, let's go.

631
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:53,342
Shit, she's coming after us.

632
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,616
What are you doing?

633
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,849
Shit, go.

634
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,383
Passports.

635
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:31,288
I want the money tonight, Johnny.
Don't disappoint me.

636
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:33,320
Yeah, I'll be there.

637
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:43,996
What happened back there?
Look, I can't just keep walking.

638
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,136
We have to go to the police.

639
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:49,636
We gotta get off the street before that
bitch tracks our asses down.

640
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:52,071
- Why would she be after us?
- We're witnesses.

641
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:55,211
Don't worry,
my place is just around the corner.

642
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:59,315
- No need to see your brother like that.
- What the fuck happened, Joe?

643
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:05,712
I'm sorry, Sammy.

644
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,814
His piece is missing. IDs?

645
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:11,985
The hooker's is a fake, the john's
is a match with the car.

646
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:14,528
We already got an APB out on him.

647
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:18,862
- What's his name?
- Fox. William Fox.

648
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,402
Listen, Joey,
you find out anything new...

649
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:24,439
...you make sure
I'm the first to know. Got it?

650
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,937
Come in.

651
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,241
To what do we owe this honor?

652
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:37,046
I was in town doing some business,
and l...

653
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,553
Wanted to you see your daddy?

654
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:41,823
And Mom.

655
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:45,792
She's watching TV,
I'm sure she'd love to see you.

656
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,362
Come on.

657
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:55,904
Mother, we have a surprise for you.

658
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,571
You two have a chat,
and I'll get you a vase for the flowers.

659
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:07,211
Hi, Mom.

660
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:15,123
I know it can't be too easy
for you here.

661
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:19,120
I want you to know I'm doing
everything I can to get you out of here.

662
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,664
Here you go.

663
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,929
You always did
have a way with flowers.

664
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,935
Such an odd quality for a boy.

665
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:33,270
- Well, I'm not your average boy.
- You can say that again.

666
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:36,742
If anything happens to her again,
I'll kill you.

667
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:41,384
Okay.

668
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:44,444
Maybe you should say good night
to Mama.

669
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:48,285
We're expecting guests.
Having a little soiree.

670
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:58,933
I'll get it.

671
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:03,297
- Oh, my.
- Look at that.

672
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,964
Looking lovely.

673
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:09,768
Olivia?
There's an officer here to see you.

674
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:12,108
Are you the fiancée of William Fox?

675
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:13,949
I am.

676
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:17,009
- It's about your boyfriend.
- Bill?

677
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:20,281
- Is there a problem?
- Yes.

678
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:22,391
Yes, there is a problem.

679
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:26,996
Because once you go black,
you never go back.

680
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,739
Will you hold this for me
for a second?

681
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:22,375
Yeah. Sure. Why not?
I'm already an outlaw.

682
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,217
Hurry it up,
this is uncomfortable.

683
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,755
I can't pee
with you standing there looking.

684
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:30,189
Well, I can't turn any more than this.

685
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,726
There's nothing you've got
that I haven't seen.

686
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:37,423
Hey.

687
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,404
For fuck's sake!

688
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,210
Jesus Christ. You're not a girl.

689
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,143
That's a matter of opinion.

690
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:51,076
You pissed all over me.

691
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,443
Some people pay me for that.

692
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:56,780
- Hey, what the fuck is your problem?
- What is my problem?

693
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:59,281
Let's see, I've been arrested...

694
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:02,482
...I watched a cop get murdered
by some psycho bitch...

695
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:03,921
...who tried to kill me.

696
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,255
And to top it off
I'm handcuffed to a woman...

697
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,796
...who's got a bigger dick than I do.

698
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:11,059
Do you have a problem with my dick?

699
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:14,500
With my dipstick?
With my power tool?

700
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:17,799
- Yeah, I think that just about covers it.
- My throbbing membrane?

701
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:20,239
- My soap on a rope?
- Shut the fuck up...

702
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,277
...or I'll knock you out and drag you
to the police station.

703
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,915
If you didn't want the banana,
you shouldn't have shaken the tree.

704
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,108
All I did was ask for directions.

705
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:31,482
The rest was all your fault,
what you did to me, you fucking freak.

706
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:33,948
Freak? It's people like you...

707
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:37,321
...who make it impossible
for people like me to live in this world.

708
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:43,324
I am more man than you will ever be.

709
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:45,994
And more woman
than you will ever get.

710
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:03,019
- What's up, big man?
- Opposite of down.

711
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:07,716
- We got a deal?
- No. He wants more. 50,000.

712
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:12,389
- Fuck that, they said 25.
- I told you that was a ballpark figure.

713
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:14,291
I'm just the middleman
on this one.

714
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:18,696
If you want a new life in paradise, you
have to come up with the full amount.

715
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,540
Give me the money.

716
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:37,751
Here you go.

717
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:43,657
- Okay.
- You got my passports?

718
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:45,822
Yeah.

719
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:56,067
George and Louise Jefferson, huh?

720
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:58,436
You are a fucking comic.

721
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,709
Congratulations,
you finally got a piece of the pie.

722
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,369
Yeah.

723
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,649
Enjoy your new life in paradise.

724
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:13,247
You know, if this doesn't work,
I'm taking you down with me.

725
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:16,423
Good to see you too.
Glad to help.

726
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,791
Come on, let's go.
Let's get out of here.

727
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:32,906
Good luck to you.

728
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:45,116
No, I can't do that.
Just get me some ice.

729
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:48,383
- Trust me, there's nothing like a steak.
- Just get me some ice.

730
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:50,583
I don't understand
why you're so resistant.

731
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,729
It's so widely known, it's a cliché.

732
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:56,497
If you want a black eye to heal
properly, you put a steak on it.

733
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,328
Let's just say
I got a soft spot for animals.

734
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:01,334
I'll take my chances with the ice.

735
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:05,271
You really are a pussy,
aren't you, Bill?

736
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:08,673
What are you, a vegetarian?

737
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:11,905
Oh, if choosing not to eat animals
makes me a pussy...

738
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:14,448
...then yes, I guess I am.

739
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,415
You are a piece of work.

740
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:17,610
I need your phone.

741
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,279
- Oh, what are you doing?
- I'm calling the police.

742
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:23,017
- No, you don't want to do that.
- Give me the phone.

743
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:29,165
Stop. You need to face the fact
that you... That we are big news.

744
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:32,962
We are involved in the murder
of one of the city's finest.

745
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,330
If we show up downtown...

746
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:37,337
...there are gonna be reporters
and photographers all over.

747
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:40,874
And your face is going to be plastered
all over the papers tomorrow.

748
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:42,602
It might be in your interest...

749
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:45,339
...not to be handcuffed
to a transsexual prostitute...

750
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:48,450
...with a rap sheet
longer than her ding-dong.

751
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:53,750
I have a friend who lives upstairs,
he's a handyman.

752
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,121
Once he gets these handcuffs
off us...

753
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:59,262
...you get to do whatever you want.

754
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,691
Oh, God.

755
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:05,694
Hey, thanks for coming, you guys.
Hey, I'll walk you up.

756
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:07,393
Bye.

757
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:09,505
- Bye.
- Bye.

758
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,805
Oh, okay, honey.
I'll call you, okay?

759
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:16,377
Drive safe.
Bye, bye-bye. Bye.

760
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,515
Man, I thought they'd be back
by now.

761
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,553
Oh, they'll be back soon.
Come on, go relax.

762
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:29,488
- Well, I may just help you clean up.
- No, don't worry about that.

763
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:32,389
Come on, let's just kick back
for a little while.

764
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:36,498
What do you eat, Bill,
since you don't eat meat?

765
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,725
Good God, give it a rest, will you?

766
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:41,871
Do you eat rice, do you eat broccoli,
do you eat vegetables?

767
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:45,839
What exactly is it
that gives you your power?

768
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:49,372
Spinach.

769
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:54,882
- Spinach?
- Yes, spinach.

770
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,247
You know, my arms blow up,
I toot my pipe.

771
00:50:57,421 --> 00:51:00,720
- Then the bad guys take it up the ass.
- You're talking my language.

772
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,756
- Why is it okay to eat spinach?
- It's a plant, or a bush or something.

773
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:08,329
It's not a conscious being
with a conscious life.

774
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:11,460
Then why do they move
toward the sun?

775
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:13,398
It's warm and that's how they grow.

776
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,372
Well, but how do they do that?

777
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,737
These plants you gobble up
with such a clear conscience...

778
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,811
...how do they know to do that
if they have no consciousness?

779
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:24,879
Because that's how God
made the earth.

780
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:28,575
They are programmed to grow,
so that we have something to eat.

781
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,481
So we don't have to eat animals.

782
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:34,112
But animals kill other animals and
don't think twice about eating them.

783
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:35,918
How does your God feel about that?

784
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:39,153
That's different, they're animals,
they don't know any better.

785
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:40,659
God forgives them.

786
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:44,630
Well, if animals are so goddamn stupid
and cruel, why not just eat them...

787
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:47,497
...and get rid of the useless bastards
once and for all?

788
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:49,639
Why not rid the earth
of every single...

789
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:52,400
...stupid, unconscious,
meat-eating motherfucker...

790
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:54,840
...who doesn't have the sense
to understand?

791
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:58,276
Look, I don't want to play any more
of your goddamn mind games.

792
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:01,813
Is that what your God intended
when he created ice, Bill?

793
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:04,579
Was it made for you and your eye
and for the swelling?

794
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:06,483
- Yes, he did.
- Was it for you?

795
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:09,853
God made it for me so that I could
do whatever the hell I want.

796
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:12,460
So why don't you give me
some fucking ice?

797
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,256
I'll just get it myself.

798
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:17,398
So it is foretold, the ice man cometh.

799
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:25,472
- There's no ice. Where's the ice?
- There is no ice, Bill.

800
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:29,373
Do you feel let down,
that your God has deserted you...

801
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:33,380
...because of your meat-eating lust
for flesh? Is your God punishing you?

802
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,108
You fucking fruitcake.

803
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:38,646
Saved by the bell.

804
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,052
<i>- Who is it?</i>
- Yo, it's Manny.

805
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:44,625
I think I got
what's a new discovery for you.

806
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:47,194
Her name is Tammy.

807
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:48,729
<i>Come in.</i>

808
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:55,334
<i>Two, three, four.</i>

809
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:46,248
Marvin?

810
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:54,622
Yo, buddy.

811
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:15,407
Thanks.

812
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:08,198
<i>Back to the same thing</i>
<i>as you are, son.</i>

813
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:11,602
<i>- Want to draw straws?</i>
<i>- Not this time, this means too much.</i>

814
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:13,800
<i>How are we gonna handle it,</i>
<i>take turns?</i>

815
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:17,276
<i>I don't trust you Southern boys</i>
<i>in the moonlight.</i>

816
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:20,143
<i>All right, let's ask it again.</i>

817
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:27,490
Popcorn? Want some popcorn?

818
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:31,388
Hot buttery popcorn.
It's good for your colon.

819
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:33,993
Want some popcorn?

820
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:44,635
- Kiss him. Kiss him.
- Shut up, colonel.

821
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:53,880
Oh, Johnny, good boy. No wires.

822
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:04,483
- Holy cow.
- Twenty-five thousand, it's clean.

823
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:11,091
- And how are George and Louise?
- Jeffersons? They're moving on up.

824
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:14,862
You know, Johnny, I always say,
money talks.

825
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,632
And bullshit walks.

826
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:24,008
You sure you don't want
any popcorn?

827
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:40,195
So tell me,
what agency are you with?

828
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:42,854
Oh, I don't have one.
I'm just beginning.

829
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:47,765
Oh, well, then, I don't usually work
with unsolicited talent.

830
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:52,063
Unsolicited? I don't... What is that?

831
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:55,734
Talent. Artists like yourself...

832
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:59,609
...who aren't represented
by a major agency.

833
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:03,108
Oh, I didn't know. I'm sorry.

834
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:07,689
Of course,
this is a non-union production...

835
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:13,319
...and if you photograph
anywhere near as good as you look...

836
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:17,093
...we could always Taft-Hartley you.

837
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:20,326
Oh, yeah, that guy Taft.

838
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:24,303
He was like the president,
or the pope or something.

839
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:28,001
- He certainly was.
- Well, who was he? What did he do?

840
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:31,645
He made it possible
for unsolicited talent like yourself...

841
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:37,481
...to override the system if an
accomplished artist-slash-producer...

842
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:41,954
...like myself, is so inspired
by your physical attributes...

843
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:45,117
...and the sheer electricity of you...

844
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:48,991
...that he decides to make you
an immediate member of the club.

845
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:53,865
- How does that happen?
- Oh, well, I've got seniority, babe.

846
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:57,939
I'm union.
And when I shoot you, you'll be union.

847
00:57:58,107 --> 00:58:03,374
Really? Oh, my God. Okay,
what is it about me? I mean, why me?

848
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:07,049
You are beautiful.
One of a kind, trust me.

849
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:10,514
- How old are you?
- I'm 17.

850
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:14,052
Oh, this is freaky.
This shoot is for <i>Seventeen</i> magazine.

851
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:17,256
- No way.
- Way.

852
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:19,821
Oh, my God, that's unbelievable.

853
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:23,295
I don't believe it either.
I guess it was meant to be.

854
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:28,403
Okay. I'll do it. Let's do it.

855
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,999
Well, then, time's a-wasting.

856
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:34,041
- Let's skedaddle.
- Okay.

857
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:37,236
Your wardrobe is in the bathroom
at the end of the hall.

858
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:41,747
The white lacy one at the far end
will be the closest to your size.

859
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:44,910
Just go ahead and change and then
we'll take some photos, okay?

860
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:48,546
- Okey-doke? Okey-doke.
- Okey-doke.

861
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:58,865
So you had a little run-in
with the pigs, did you?

862
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,094
Yeah, I guess you could say that.

863
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:04,569
What makes them think they can
tell a man what he can or can't do...

864
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:07,073
...with his own dick?
- It was a mistake.

865
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:09,541
- How's that?
- I was just asking for directions.

866
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:12,112
- Asking who?
- From her.

867
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:16,342
That's a little insensitive. "Her,"
and point like that. She has a name.

868
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,386
I'm sorry to say
we haven't been properly introduced.

869
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:22,888
Well, perhaps I can be
of a little service in this department.

870
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:28,759
Gigi, this is...
What's your name there, Oswald?

871
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,932
- Bill.
- Oh, well done.

872
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:38,404
- Gigi, this is Bill. Bill, Gigi.
- Pleasure to meet you, Bill.

873
00:59:40,944 --> 00:59:43,970
- Are you almost done yet?
- Somebody's got ants in their pants.

874
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:47,114
I spent the last two hours
flushing my life down the toilet.

875
00:59:47,283 --> 00:59:50,411
- I think I've got to be edgy, don't you?
- Don't be dragging me...

876
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:54,148
...into it there, cowboy.
I am just an innocent bystander.

877
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:59,851
- Watch out for your wrist right now.
- Goddamn it! You cut me, man.

878
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,398
Had a tetanus shot lately?

879
01:00:03,566 --> 01:00:07,468
Trust me, that is the least
of my problems. I'm calling the police.

880
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:12,301
You know, Jim,
I've had a really rough night...

881
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:15,467
...and maybe I could just
take a rain check, just this once.

882
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:19,172
Because I just wanna
take a bath and rela...

883
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:23,481
All right, fine,
but we're doing it at your place.

884
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:25,951
Fair enough. I don't wanna
get down and dirty...

885
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:29,148
...in front of him, anyway.
Got way too many hang-ups.

886
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:35,488
- No, I can't.
- Come on, all the kids are doing it.

887
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:57,452
- Okay, yeah, first base, that's it.
- Oh, come on, that's not fair, is it?

888
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:05,689
It's been three months
since Puerto Vallarta. Come on.

889
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:08,057
I want you.

890
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:12,162
- God, I want you too.
- Yeah.

891
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:18,367
- I love you.
- Me too, you.

892
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:29,846
Okay. Yeah, I can't do this.

893
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,913
I just don't understand this.

894
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:40,052
Is this because you're engaged?
Getting married?

895
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:44,524
I'm pregnant.

896
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:53,566
Yeah. And you don't even know
the half of it, honey.

897
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,337
We gotta talk.

898
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:03,010
Hello?

899
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:22,132
- Hello.
- Hello yourself.

900
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:26,070
Hi. Where's Manny?

901
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:30,507
I sent him out for some pizza. Come.

902
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,914
Let's paint that pretty little face
of yours before he comes back.

903
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:38,884
Oh, don't worry about her.
That's just my wife.

904
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:42,024
We'll have a snack later. Come.

905
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,722
Meddler.

906
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,408
Sam here. Joey? What do you got?

907
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:06,244
Scumbag called it in himself?
Where are they?

908
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:09,475
Give me 30 minutes
before you move on him.

909
01:03:14,657 --> 01:03:18,684
Look at that mouth of yours.
The perfect pout.

910
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:23,956
- Everything okay, Tammy?
- I feel kind of strange.

911
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:27,193
You're probably
just a little bit nervous.

912
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:30,197
Here, take a sip of your soda.

913
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:35,369
All better?

914
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:38,570
- Are you done?
- Not quite yet.

915
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:47,816
There it is.

916
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:55,621
The face that launched
a thousand ships. Beautiful, no?

917
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:02,665
- I look kind of, you know, sad.
- And beautiful.

918
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:09,176
That's the look that sells.
The tortured teen with a tender heart.

919
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:13,372
It's what they're all looking for
and you've got it in spades.

920
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:16,416
- You really think so?
- I really do.

921
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:19,110
Of course, the real
proof of the pudding...

922
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:21,552
...will be to see how you look on film.

923
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:25,386
Okay.

924
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,949
- Who are you?
- Police.

925
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:58,720
Wow, I didn't expect you here
that quickly.

926
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:02,797
Obviously.
I found this in your pocket.

927
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:05,866
Oh, yeah. That was the cop's.
I took it for protection.

928
01:05:06,035 --> 01:05:10,028
- From who?
- That psycho bitch who killed him.

929
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:13,875
- The hooker.
- The one you picked up?

930
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:15,801
No, the other one.

931
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:20,108
- So where's your hooker?
- She's upstairs having sex with Jim.

932
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:24,618
He's the handyman.
That's how she pays him.

933
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,913
- For what?
- For whatever.

934
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:30,058
I mean, tonight he cut off
our handcuffs with that saw.

935
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,955
She goes up,
she blows him. I don't know.

936
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:37,161
Why do you have
that steak on your head?

937
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:41,997
It's on my eye.
She, he, the hooker, Gigi...

938
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:45,071
...the girl with the dick
sucker-punched me.

939
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:49,973
Arrest me, take me downtown and
I'll answer all the questions you want.

940
01:05:50,746 --> 01:05:52,839
Hello there, Billy-boy.

941
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:56,473
Did you happen to lose a little card
with your number on it?

942
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:58,745
You rocked my world tonight.

943
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:02,288
I just wanted to tell you,
you've never done me like that before.

944
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:07,326
I hope you enjoyed your big gulp.
Toodle-oo, kiss, kiss.

945
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:10,124
- Thanks for the loaner.
- How'd it work out for you?

946
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:14,099
A little tight in the shoulders,
but it was a kick.

947
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:16,271
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

948
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:19,865
- I forgot my saw.
- No, don't worry. Not with him up there.

949
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:22,442
- You can get it tomorrow.
- Righty-o.

950
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:28,449
- So, what's it gonna be?
- How about a hot sausage and mayo?

951
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:31,044
Coming right up.

952
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:34,613
Holy cow.

953
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:37,758
You're a real fucking scumbag,
aren't you?

954
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,861
- You cop-killing scum.
- Cop-killing what?

955
01:06:41,063 --> 01:06:44,863
- That was my baby brother.
- I didn't kill anyone.

956
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:22,236
Okay, Tammy.

957
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:32,379
Lights, camera, bubbles, action.

958
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:38,378
Come on, Tammy, put on your dancing
shoes and let's see what you got.

959
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:45,883
Up on your feet. Thattagirl.
Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my.

960
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,121
Hold it right there. Don't move.

961
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:52,598
You're gonna be a star,
I can feel it in my bones, yes, I can.

962
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:55,134
I'm gonna be a star.

963
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:26,834
- Excellent.
- I'm a star.

964
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:30,938
Yes, you are a star. A real Rockette.

965
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,370
Perfect, yes.

966
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:40,014
You're gonna be a star, a star.

967
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:49,390
I'm so tired.

968
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:53,354
Oh, it's all right, honey.

969
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:57,625
You probably just need a little rest.

970
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:08,540
Yeah.

971
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:10,645
What?

972
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:12,872
I can't... l...

973
01:09:13,048 --> 01:09:16,506
Jeez, I can't understand
a word you're saying. What?

974
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:20,646
That's not funny.

975
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:22,414
That's...

976
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:25,993
All right, shut up, shut up, wha...?

977
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:29,996
You know better than...
We're on a cell phone, for chrissake.

978
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:36,165
Meet me at the club. Yes, now.

979
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:43,477
Turn the car around.
We're going back downtown.

980
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:25,043
- I want my money.
- Isn't that fucking rich?

981
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,554
That's a real side-splitter. My best
friend is dead because of you...

982
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:30,783
...and now I'm supposed to
pay you for that?

983
01:10:30,993 --> 01:10:32,688
I did my part.

984
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:38,356
I set him up, I made the phone call
just like you told me to, and...

985
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:41,728
Then everything
went fucking haywire.

986
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:45,271
It wasn't my fault, Johnny.
I didn't plan it, you did.

987
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:48,035
To have my best friend killed?
No, I don't think so.

988
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:51,202
You wanted his wife.
You wanted to destroy their marriage.

989
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:54,907
You wanted to set him up.
It was your stupid fucking idea.

990
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,915
Now give me the money.

991
01:10:57,119 --> 01:11:00,452
If anybody has the right to be snippety
right now, I think it's me.

992
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:04,218
It's always about you, isn't it,
Johnny? What about me?

993
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:08,124
I have two dead men floating
in my bathtub.

994
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:11,960
You think you got problems?
How am I gonna explain that?

995
01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:15,262
Yeah, well, you got something right.
That's your fucking problem.

996
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:18,565
It's gonna be your fucking problem
if you don't give me my money.

997
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:20,971
That's right,
I will tell the cops everything.

998
01:11:21,143 --> 01:11:26,137
How you enticed me, an ex-client,
to do your dirty work for you.

999
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:29,681
You probably would lose your license
to practice, Johnny.

1000
01:11:35,157 --> 01:11:36,681
Well, there you go.

1001
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:39,924
There you go.

1002
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,267
I don't ever
wanna hear from you again.

1003
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:06,980
<i>Hello there, Billy-boy.</i>

1004
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:11,183
<i>Did you happen to lose a little card</i>
<i>with your number on it?</i>

1005
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,725
<i>You rocked my world tonight.</i>

1006
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:16,831
<i>I just wanted to tell you, you've never</i>
<i>done me like that before.</i>

1007
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:21,629
<i>I hope you enjoyed your big gulp.</i>
<i>Toodle-oo, kiss, kiss.</i>

1008
01:12:22,204 --> 01:12:24,695
What the fuck?

1009
01:12:24,873 --> 01:12:27,637
<i>I hope you enjoyed your big gulp.</i>
<i>Toodle-oo, kiss, kiss.</i>

1010
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:31,312
All right. Come in.

1011
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:35,647
Is this the home of William Fox?

1012
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:37,183
You know what?

1013
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:40,481
Right, it was funny the first time
and everything but...

1014
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:43,250
I'm not... I just... I can't do two of you.

1015
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:46,520
Excuse me? Ma'am,
there must be some misunderstand...

1016
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:49,493
I am not in the mood
for two big black dicks...

1017
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:53,192
...flying around in my face, all right?
So why don't you get the fuck out?

1018
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,427
Calm down.

1019
01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:58,231
Let's try this again.
Is this the home of William Fox?

1020
01:12:59,074 --> 01:13:01,770
Do you know William Fox?

1021
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:05,275
I'm... I'm his fiancée.

1022
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,677
I think you'd better take a seat,
ma'am.

1023
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:09,875
We have some difficult news for you.

1024
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:12,418
It's about your fiancé.

1025
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:34,665
Hey, Olivia, how are you?

1026
01:13:35,477 --> 01:13:36,967
What?

1027
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:42,740
Wait... Calm down, now.
I don't understand what you're saying.

1028
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:45,784
What do you mean, Bill's dead?

1029
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:49,748
No, no, that... l... That can't...

1030
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:52,553
Okay, just hol...
Just hold on a second, all right?

1031
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:54,559
Where are you?

1032
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:57,064
Identify the...?

1033
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:01,199
You want me to meet you where?

1034
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:10,712
Can I help you, bro?

1035
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:12,345
lt... It's him.

1036
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:16,951
Right.

1037
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:18,780
Shall we?

1038
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:24,122
I know this is difficult,
but just to prepare you...

1039
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:28,821
...he's been electrocuted, burned,
so this ain't gonna be pretty.

1040
01:14:31,233 --> 01:14:32,962
Is that him?

1041
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:35,035
Yeah.

1042
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:38,138
More or less, yeah.

1043
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:44,470
Could we...?
Could we just have a moment alone?

1044
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:48,177
Me and you?

1045
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:51,377
Me and everybody but you.

1046
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:56,246
Right.

1047
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:58,690
Time allotted for that.

1048
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:00,957
Grieve away.

1049
01:15:06,702 --> 01:15:10,160
Jesus, Johnny.
What the hell happened?

1050
01:15:10,906 --> 01:15:14,069
I came home to a message
on my machine last night...

1051
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:17,473
...that was clearly from a woman
who he had slept with.

1052
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:18,704
What, the hooker?

1053
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:20,372
The hooker?

1054
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:25,517
Look, we stopped to get a pizza,
all right? Phil and I went inside.

1055
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:27,985
Bill was fucked up
so we left him in the car.

1056
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:31,216
We came out, he was pulling
away with what looked like a hooker.

1057
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:32,758
That's just fucking great.

1058
01:15:32,928 --> 01:15:35,522
Yeah, a fucking hooker
a week before the wedding? God.

1059
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:38,556
Don't you think it's better
you found out now?

1060
01:15:38,734 --> 01:15:42,898
Oh, Jesus, it's my fault.
l... I pushed him away.

1061
01:15:43,071 --> 01:15:46,666
I would hardly call sleeping with him
every night "pushing him away."

1062
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:48,173
What are you talking about?

1063
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:52,245
Bill said the two of you slept together
every single night, no matter what.

1064
01:15:52,414 --> 01:15:55,872
I haven't had sex with Bill in three
months. Not since Puerto Vallarta.

1065
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:59,953
- I just couldn't.
- Okay, yeah, because l...

1066
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:04,090
I thought that l... I'm really glad
to hear that, that's a relief.

1067
01:16:04,259 --> 01:16:06,284
What's a relief?

1068
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:10,420
I'm just glad that Puerto Vallarta
meant as much to you as it did to me.

1069
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:16,896
Right, you think that because I haven't
had sex with Bill since you and I...

1070
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:19,903
Say it, all right? Say it. Made love.

1071
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:22,441
Oh, please, Johnny,
I was practically passed out.

1072
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:24,977
You can't make love to somebody
who isn't there.

1073
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:27,980
- Well, you can at least try.
- Oh, Johnny.

1074
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:30,778
What is the matter with you?
What about Jane?

1075
01:16:31,787 --> 01:16:33,482
I don't think Jane has to know.

1076
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:36,123
At least until we know
what the next move is.

1077
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:41,892
Well, there isn't really gonna be a
next move because I already told her.

1078
01:16:42,064 --> 01:16:44,498
What? Why would you do that?

1079
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:48,102
Because I don't want to have anything
to do with you anymore, Johnny.

1080
01:16:49,171 --> 01:16:50,297
What?

1081
01:16:53,008 --> 01:16:54,908
Jesus!

1082
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:00,348
That girl looks like
she just saw a ghost.

1083
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:02,745
- He just fricking moved.
- Rigor-mortal spasm.

1084
01:17:02,918 --> 01:17:04,249
Happens all the time.

1085
01:17:04,419 --> 01:17:08,321
So if that is Mr. William Fox,
and you're able to speak up for him...

1086
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:12,187
...l'm gonna need you
to sign on the dotted line.

1087
01:17:50,565 --> 01:17:51,998
You going somewhere?

1088
01:17:55,671 --> 01:18:00,472
Yeah, Puerto Vallarta.
Thought I might get a little action.

1089
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:06,879
So how was your swinging cock fest?

1090
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,480
It was good, fine.

1091
01:18:11,053 --> 01:18:13,214
Everything went fine.

1092
01:18:16,058 --> 01:18:17,685
How was the shower?

1093
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:21,454
Yeah, fine. Everything was fine.

1094
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:27,062
How long you going for?

1095
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:32,673
That's my suitcase.

1096
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:35,269
What?

1097
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:40,573
That's my suitcase.
It's not your suitcase. That's mine.

1098
01:18:40,982 --> 01:18:45,248
- Can I borrow it?
- No, it's part of a set.

1099
01:18:45,987 --> 01:18:49,252
- I really rather you didn't.
- I'll be careful with it.

1100
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:54,491
I don't think I wanna take the chance.

1101
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,230
- No, I am out of here.
- Jane.

1102
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:01,528
- Now, listen, okay?
- Please.

1103
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:04,228
Jane, listen, don't go.
Look, don't go, okay?

1104
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:06,772
I slipped up, I know.
I was drunk, I'm sorry.

1105
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:11,140
- Yeah, well, you got Olivia pregnant.
- What?

1106
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:14,578
So I think that qualifies
as a little bit more than a slip-up.

1107
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:17,048
- Olivia's pregnant?
- Yeah, that's right.

1108
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:19,153
Congratulations,
you're gonna be a daddy.

1109
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:22,552
Wait a minute.
Listen, listen, Jane, Jane, listen.

1110
01:19:22,724 --> 01:19:24,157
Let's work this through, okay?

1111
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:28,820
Let's just talk about it.
You don't wanna go, you shouldn't go.

1112
01:19:30,465 --> 01:19:35,300
Yeah, you know what? You're right.

1113
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:38,064
Okay.

1114
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,434
You should.

1115
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:42,441
Jane. Jane, come on.

1116
01:19:43,311 --> 01:19:45,472
It's Mr. Grand.

1117
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:49,178
Your parcel is wrapped
and ready to be picked up...

1118
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:52,514
...and I must say,
you'll be quite pleased.

1119
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:56,589
It's a very pretty little package.

1120
01:19:56,758 --> 01:19:59,352
Pretty little package, huh?

1121
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:05,661
See, like I was saying...

1122
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:08,992
...this guy, Enrique,
and a couple of his friends...

1123
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:13,801
...they put me up in the Hilton and they
had their way with me all weekend.

1124
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:16,273
No? No?

1125
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:19,440
Are you sorry? Oh, you're sorry?

1126
01:20:19,614 --> 01:20:22,481
You really scared that nigga,
he gave me the right code.

1127
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:24,619
Good. Bag it, let's go.

1128
01:20:24,786 --> 01:20:27,311
Sorry about this, brother,
you know how it is.

1129
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:31,356
- Go down and wait for me in the car.
- We'll be out of here, baby.

1130
01:20:31,526 --> 01:20:33,585
Leave the cash.

1131
01:20:38,366 --> 01:20:40,391
Baby, this is me.

1132
01:20:40,602 --> 01:20:44,003
I know you running the show but
this is me. You don't trust me by now?

1133
01:20:44,206 --> 01:20:47,369
Trust is for fools and virgins.

1134
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:48,702
Now, go.

1135
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:53,205
All right.

1136
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:57,745
I'll see you downstairs.

1137
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:02,019
So like I was saying...

1138
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:05,853
...then they put me in the trunk
and they took me downtown...

1139
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:08,655
...and they threw me in a Dumpster...

1140
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:10,729
...to die.

1141
01:21:10,932 --> 01:21:13,162
Can you imagine that?

1142
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:17,862
I was left there, bleeding to death,
to die, imagine that.

1143
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:21,406
It was lucky for me
the next day was trash day.

1144
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:26,705
So this isn't just for me.

1145
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,406
Do you believe in God?

1146
01:21:30,518 --> 01:21:34,386
I said, do you believe in God?

1147
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:40,084
Well, guess what.

1148
01:21:40,929 --> 01:21:44,023
He does not believe in you.

1149
01:22:06,288 --> 01:22:07,983
Mom?

1150
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:10,985
Mom, what's the matter?

1151
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:13,053
Mom...

1152
01:22:13,495 --> 01:22:14,723
...what's going on?

1153
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:22,061
Nigger this, bitch.

1154
01:22:33,415 --> 01:22:35,110
Meddler.

1155
01:22:37,852 --> 01:22:39,786
Mom?

1156
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:03,201
Damn, Carlos, baby,
you don't look so good.

1157
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:05,175
Do you know
what I was thinking today?

1158
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:07,975
I was thinking
that when I picked you up from jail...

1159
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:12,051
...I thought maybe, just maybe, that
you had learned something in there.

1160
01:23:12,787 --> 01:23:13,947
But you didn't.

1161
01:23:14,155 --> 01:23:17,522
The minute you got out,
you started with your "nigger" shit.

1162
01:23:17,692 --> 01:23:22,857
"Nigger" this, "nigger" that.
Same old shit.

1163
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:27,365
But guess what, baby.
This nigger is smarter than you.

1164
01:23:27,535 --> 01:23:30,197
That's right, because
I been sitting out here waiting...

1165
01:23:30,372 --> 01:23:34,832
...for you to bring your ass out here
so I could run you the fuck over.

1166
01:23:35,043 --> 01:23:37,341
One for you, two for me.

1167
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:40,003
One for you, three for me.

1168
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:42,342
Three for me, and none for you.

1169
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:44,883
- What the fuck is that?
- It's a split.

1170
01:23:45,587 --> 01:23:49,523
- You said we were going half and half.
- That's if you nailed that sheep, dude.

1171
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:53,525
I gotta go, Carlos.
I'm getting all emotional.

1172
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:55,890
I love you, baby.

1173
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:11,778
Shit. What was that?

1174
01:24:11,946 --> 01:24:15,848
Gunshots, homes, from over there.
Let's go check it out.

1175
01:24:17,252 --> 01:24:19,618
Fucking bitch.

1176
01:24:33,868 --> 01:24:36,268
Who's the bitch, huh?

1177
01:24:58,426 --> 01:25:00,621
<i>Fuck.</i>

1178
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:07,325
Look at this shit.

1179
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:09,868
Two dead people.

1180
01:25:14,242 --> 01:25:16,437
Look what I found.

1181
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:25,314
Shit, homey. We're rich, dude.

1182
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:13,558
Call for backup!

1183
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:29,711
Dad. Come on, open up.
I know you're in there.

1184
01:26:29,884 --> 01:26:33,479
Johnny, there are police
all over the place out there.

1185
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:37,350
- Dad, I need to talk to you.
- You need a lobotomy.

1186
01:26:37,525 --> 01:26:40,585
- Now go away.
- Open the goddamn door.

1187
01:26:40,828 --> 01:26:42,887
I wanna see Mom.

1188
01:26:44,165 --> 01:26:49,159
You march yourself right back down
those stairs and surrender.

1189
01:26:49,337 --> 01:26:51,271
Johnny, go away.

1190
01:26:53,107 --> 01:26:55,234
Johnny?

1191
01:27:00,682 --> 01:27:03,708
Johnny. Johnny, stop it.

1192
01:27:04,419 --> 01:27:07,684
Johnny, Johnny,
you're frightening your mother.

1193
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:13,220
- You sick...
- Stop it, John, no, no.

1194
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:35,244
Mom, what's going on?
I thought you were in trouble.

1195
01:27:55,236 --> 01:27:56,601
Oh, my God.

1196
01:28:02,543 --> 01:28:04,135
It's okay.

1197
01:28:05,246 --> 01:28:07,271
- What happened?
- It's okay, it's all right.

1198
01:28:07,448 --> 01:28:10,849
- Where am I?
- You're safe, you're safe.

1199
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:18,953
You stay right here, all right?

1200
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:23,564
I'm gonna make sure that this
never happens to anyone ever again.

1201
01:28:28,102 --> 01:28:30,434
Daddy?

1202
01:28:32,206 --> 01:28:34,504
Daddy?

1203
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:43,880
We're fucking loaded, little cousin.
Now we can get us some real bitches.

1204
01:28:44,085 --> 01:28:47,987
- The kind you have to pay for.
- We?

1205
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:54,356
I found it. It's mine.

1206
01:28:54,962 --> 01:28:58,454
We're partners, partners in crime.

1207
01:28:58,633 --> 01:29:01,864
You wasn't gonna share with me,
you cheated me.

1208
01:29:02,036 --> 01:29:05,403
- Why should I share with you?
- So that's how it's gonna be.

1209
01:29:05,606 --> 01:29:10,737
- Finders keepers, huh?
- Finders keepers.

1210
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:18,414
What in the hell is wrong with you?

1211
01:29:20,655 --> 01:29:23,988
I do the best I can, Johnny.
I'm not perfect.

1212
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:26,092
You really believe that, don't you?

1213
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:29,161
Okay, what do you want me to say?
I screwed up?

1214
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:33,198
I was a lousy dad?
That isn't gonna change anything.

1215
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:35,199
You're still gonna have your issues...

1216
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:38,533
...and your mother isn't
gonna be jitterbugging anytime soon.

1217
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:54,187
- This isn't about you and me, Johnny.
- Well, what is it about, Dad?

1218
01:29:54,355 --> 01:29:57,847
You wanna know what it's about,
Johnny?

1219
01:29:58,659 --> 01:30:01,287
This is what it's about, Johnny.

1220
01:30:01,462 --> 01:30:04,363
The American dream.

1221
01:30:04,532 --> 01:30:10,027
The land of the free,
the home of the brave, Johnny.

1222
01:30:10,204 --> 01:30:13,367
It's every man for himself.

1223
01:30:14,041 --> 01:30:15,770
You make me sick.

1224
01:30:17,211 --> 01:30:18,235
Stop.

1225
01:30:18,446 --> 01:30:19,743
Johnny.

1226
01:30:24,318 --> 01:30:28,880
I love you, hold on to me, boy.

1227
01:30:29,624 --> 01:30:33,390
I'm sorry, Dad.
I'm gonna have to let you go.

1228
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:36,256
Goddamn it, you hold on to me, John.

1229
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:38,092
You hold on to me.

1230
01:30:38,299 --> 01:30:42,565
Johnny!

1231
01:30:43,404 --> 01:30:46,066
Johnny!

1232
01:30:48,075 --> 01:30:51,636
<i>They say to move forward in life,</i>
<i>you gotta let go of the past.</i>

1233
01:30:51,813 --> 01:30:54,338
<i>Well, I did, literally.</i>

1234
01:30:54,515 --> 01:30:57,507
<i>And for me,</i>
<i>there ain't no going back.</i>

1235
01:30:58,119 --> 01:31:01,145
<i>So here I am,</i>
<i>paying my debt to society.</i>

1236
01:31:01,322 --> 01:31:03,415
<i>They found the cash,</i>
<i>traced the passports...</i>

1237
01:31:03,591 --> 01:31:05,456
<i>... got me on</i>
<i>first-degree manslaughter.</i>

1238
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:10,086
<i>But hey, I saved that little girl's life</i>
<i>and I set my mother free...</i>

1239
01:31:10,264 --> 01:31:13,256
<i>... so for once in my life,</i>
<i>I'm the good guy.</i>

1240
01:31:13,434 --> 01:31:16,460
<i>I guess no good deed</i>
<i>goes unpunished.</i>

1241
01:31:16,671 --> 01:31:19,139
- Hey, Johnny.
- Hi, honey.

1242
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:22,105
- Hi, Johnny.
- Hi, Oliv.

1243
01:31:24,278 --> 01:31:27,008
You look great. You both look great.

1244
01:31:27,181 --> 01:31:29,775
Yeah, how are you?

1245
01:31:29,951 --> 01:31:33,648
Oh, great. Peachy.

1246
01:31:33,888 --> 01:31:34,980
You?

1247
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:39,324
- Good, good.
- Yeah, yeah, we're doing okay.

1248
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:41,655
How's Mom?

1249
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:44,958
She's great.
Actually, she's living with us now.

1250
01:31:47,468 --> 01:31:49,197
- Us?
- Yeah.

1251
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:52,533
Olivia moved in to our house to...

1252
01:31:53,074 --> 01:31:56,475
You know, to help with Mom and...

1253
01:31:57,845 --> 01:31:59,472
Jane and l...

1254
01:31:59,647 --> 01:32:00,909
Well, we've decided...

1255
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:06,713
We've decided to have the baby,
Johnny.

1256
01:32:08,923 --> 01:32:10,185
Like a couple?

1257
01:32:12,894 --> 01:32:15,419
We're not rushing into anything.

1258
01:32:15,596 --> 01:32:18,724
Yeah, no,
we're just taking it one day at a time.

1259
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:20,060
Yeah.

1260
01:32:21,669 --> 01:32:23,364
What about me?

1261
01:32:24,505 --> 01:32:28,236
You made it clear that you didn't want
to have anything to do with children...

1262
01:32:28,409 --> 01:32:30,877
...so I didn't think
it was going to be an issue.

1263
01:32:31,045 --> 01:32:35,414
We don't know when you're gonna be
available to participate with him.

1264
01:32:35,583 --> 01:32:38,518
Him? It's a boy?

1265
01:32:38,686 --> 01:32:40,779
Oh, well...

1266
01:32:40,955 --> 01:32:43,617
...it's too early to know the sex yet.

1267
01:32:43,824 --> 01:32:48,921
But if it is a boy,
we've decided to name him Bill.

1268
01:32:51,532 --> 01:32:53,727
Yeah, I think that's fitting.

1269
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:57,530
And if it's a girl, so far we like Java.

1270
01:32:58,839 --> 01:33:00,238
Java?

1271
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:02,376
Yeah, Jane and Olivia.

1272
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:04,204
- Java.
- Java.

1273
01:33:07,148 --> 01:33:09,708
You do know that's a slang term
for coffee?

1274
01:33:09,917 --> 01:33:14,581
Yes, but it's also
an exotic island in Asia.

1275
01:33:14,789 --> 01:33:17,724
Why don't you just call her
Sex on the Beach, for chrissakes?

1276
01:33:17,892 --> 01:33:20,486
Johnny, do you always
have to be so goddamn sarcastic?

1277
01:33:20,661 --> 01:33:23,323
No, I just don't want my child
named after a beverage.

1278
01:33:23,497 --> 01:33:27,797
- Oh, so now it's your child?
- Well, yeah, biologically.

1279
01:33:27,969 --> 01:33:32,838
And I have to say, you know, I'm a little
hurt here and I feel a little left out.

1280
01:33:33,007 --> 01:33:35,567
Seems like there's been
a lot of decisions made...

1281
01:33:35,743 --> 01:33:38,268
...without any thought
of how I might feel about it.

1282
01:33:38,446 --> 01:33:40,641
- You haven't really been available.
- Yeah.

1283
01:33:40,815 --> 01:33:43,113
I don't know
how much more available I can be.

1284
01:33:43,284 --> 01:33:44,945
I'm pretty much here, you know.

1285
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:47,815
There's not really any
answering machine to get messages.

1286
01:33:47,989 --> 01:33:50,184
Every Wednesday from 2 to 6.

1287
01:33:50,391 --> 01:33:54,007
You know what, Johnny?
This isn't about...

1288
01:36:54,008 --> 01:36:55,008
