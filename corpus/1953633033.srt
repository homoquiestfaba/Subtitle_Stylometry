1
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,981
Are you okay, Mom?

2
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:33,015
It's just a little stomach ache.

3
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,088
Can you keep an eye
on the baby while I lay down?

4
00:01:37,088 --> 00:01:38,070
Yeah.

5
00:02:13,823 --> 00:02:15,961
Okay, it's okay.

6
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:17,759
Everything's gonna be okay.

7
00:02:25,247 --> 00:02:26,523
Good night, little brother.

8
00:03:37,757 --> 00:03:39,644
Give me strength, Lords.

9
00:04:03,003 --> 00:04:05,084
- Benjamin?
- Yes.

10
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:08,507
Something is wrong,
I need to go to the hospital.

11
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:11,067
You can't go to the hospital,
sweetheart.

12
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:12,212
Why not?

13
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:16,668
It's time for the final step.

14
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:18,577
What are you talking about?

15
00:04:40,507 --> 00:04:41,783
Elizabeth?

16
00:04:42,523 --> 00:04:44,017
Daniel?

17
00:04:45,914 --> 00:04:47,224
What's wrong?

18
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,535
9-1-1,
where is your emergency?

19
00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:16,145
Daniel.

20
00:06:21,432 --> 00:06:22,520
I'm sorry, Bryan.

21
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,632
Give me the baby, Daniel!

22
00:06:24,632 --> 00:06:25,973
It has to be finished!

23
00:06:31,383 --> 00:06:32,910
Daniel.

24
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,272
Daniel, it's the only way.

25
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:06,831
For the good of us all.

26
00:07:11,062 --> 00:07:13,266
You just don't understand.

27
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,655
Where is he, Daniel!

28
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,876
Hello?

29
00:08:25,876 --> 00:08:27,054
Anyone home?

30
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:04,488
Mr. Conroy.

31
00:09:26,258 --> 00:09:27,305
My God.

32
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,767
I was wrong.

33
00:09:44,657 --> 00:09:45,935
There's one more.

34
00:09:56,657 --> 00:09:59,697
Oh, my parents flipped when
they found out I applied out of state.

35
00:09:59,697 --> 00:10:02,609
But whatever, it's not like
they really have a say in what I do.

36
00:10:02,609 --> 00:10:03,951
Man, you're so lucky.

37
00:10:04,849 --> 00:10:06,417
I'd give anything to get outta here.

38
00:10:06,417 --> 00:10:09,232
What, Mary Mother of God
still callin' all the shots?

39
00:10:09,232 --> 00:10:13,297
She thinks colleges are, uh,
morally corrupt breeding grounds.

40
00:10:13,297 --> 00:10:14,759
Well, yeah.

41
00:10:17,553 --> 00:10:19,057
Damn it.

42
00:10:19,057 --> 00:10:20,202
Nothin' yet.

43
00:10:21,425 --> 00:10:23,056
Birthday present.

44
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:26,024
Ah-- jealous.

45
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:33,575
Hey.

46
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:35,375
What?

47
00:10:36,528 --> 00:10:39,024
Hey, eventually my mom's
gonna start to notice.

48
00:10:39,024 --> 00:10:40,365
Come on, she never notices.

49
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:43,696
She's gonna be home any minute,
so you gotta clear out.

50
00:10:43,696 --> 00:10:44,849
Why?

51
00:10:44,849 --> 00:10:46,704
Because you know I'm not
supposed to have friends over,

52
00:10:46,704 --> 00:10:47,718
especially you.

53
00:10:48,624 --> 00:10:49,572
Come on.

54
00:10:52,304 --> 00:10:53,776
Typical.

55
00:10:53,776 --> 00:10:55,215
What?

56
00:10:55,215 --> 00:10:57,743
Have you ever had a thought
that she didn't feed you?

57
00:10:57,743 --> 00:10:59,215
Uh, of course.

58
00:10:59,215 --> 00:11:01,583
Yeah, uh, let me see
your cell phone real quick.

59
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,831
You know I don't have one.

60
00:11:02,831 --> 00:11:04,591
Oh, right-- why is that again?

61
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:06,860
Because they cause brain tumors.

62
00:11:08,111 --> 00:11:09,135
Bingo.

63
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,375
See, it's like you're
a weird little clone.

64
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,652
Good-bye, Scott.

65
00:11:14,735 --> 00:11:16,976
I'm gonna come back
and find you and her

66
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,081
running a creepy motel
right off the Interstate, aren't I?

67
00:11:20,303 --> 00:11:22,442
Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!

68
00:11:24,303 --> 00:11:25,612
Get a TV.

69
00:11:45,742 --> 00:11:47,246
This is Andrew Judson.

70
00:11:47,246 --> 00:11:51,087
Hi, Mr. Judson, this is uh,
Johnny-- John Petrie.

71
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:53,454
Yes, yes, yes,
I've been waiting for you to call.

72
00:11:53,454 --> 00:11:55,470
Yeah, I think there's been
some kind of mistake.

73
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,582
I don't know
any Benjamin Conroy.

74
00:11:57,582 --> 00:11:59,885
Uh, it's no mistake,
the estate of Mr. Conroy

75
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,413
has been willed to you
as of your 18th birthday,

76
00:12:02,413 --> 00:12:04,142
which was a few days ago,
if I'm correct.

77
00:12:04,142 --> 00:12:06,126
Yeah, but uh, again I--

78
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,366
The property's worth
a substantial amount of money.

79
00:12:08,366 --> 00:12:11,053
I really need to go over
all the logistics in person.

80
00:12:11,053 --> 00:12:13,606
When's the soonest
you can come to Wellfield?

81
00:12:15,213 --> 00:12:17,293
See, that's the thing,
I can't exactly just leave.

82
00:12:18,285 --> 00:12:19,659
- Uh, Mr. Judson, I'll call you back.
- Yes, of course, but--

83
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:23,045
Hi, Mom.

84
00:12:24,621 --> 00:12:25,773
New doctor?

85
00:12:25,773 --> 00:12:27,661
I ran into Helen Sampson today

86
00:12:27,661 --> 00:12:30,125
and she told me about this new
medication her daughter was prescribed

87
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,172
for generalized anxiety
and mild depression.

88
00:12:32,172 --> 00:12:35,949
Dr. Webster said it was too dangerous
to take with my Klonopin and Valium.

89
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:37,891
So, I went to Helen's doctor and--

90
00:12:39,213 --> 00:12:41,164
he was more than happy
to prescribe it.

91
00:12:41,164 --> 00:12:42,828
That's great.

92
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,803
That's the last time I see
that Webster quack.

93
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:51,788
Hey, Mom, can I talk to you
about something?

94
00:12:51,788 --> 00:12:54,381
If this is about going to college
again, you can stop right there.

95
00:12:54,381 --> 00:12:57,004
Those communal showers
are nothing but state sanctioned

96
00:12:57,004 --> 00:12:58,764
homosexual bath houses.

97
00:12:58,764 --> 00:13:01,388
No, I-- I was wondering
if I could go, uh--

98
00:13:01,388 --> 00:13:03,180
to church?

99
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,124
Don't think I don't know how long
it's been since your last confession.

100
00:13:06,124 --> 00:13:09,035
No, Mom, to this town.

101
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:10,923
It's called Wellfield.

102
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,101
It's in Maine.

103
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:14,283
Pardon me?

104
00:13:14,283 --> 00:13:15,948
I got this letter today and--

105
00:13:15,948 --> 00:13:18,059
You're not going anywhere,
do you you hear me?

106
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:20,427
I am your mother and I make
the rules around here.

107
00:13:20,427 --> 00:13:21,867
So, not another word.

108
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:24,619
- But--
- Not another word.

109
00:13:24,619 --> 00:13:26,113
Who's Benjamin Conroy?

110
00:13:44,011 --> 00:13:45,931
- Are you Mary's son?
- Yes.

111
00:13:45,931 --> 00:13:47,498
I wanted to hold her
for a few days

112
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:50,219
for a more thorough
psych evaluation.

113
00:13:50,219 --> 00:13:53,318
Which, trust me,
sounds much worse than it is.

114
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,522
- A few days?
- Yeah.

115
00:14:14,058 --> 00:14:15,305
Mr. Judson?

116
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,240
Hey, man?

117
00:15:07,144 --> 00:15:08,360
Hi.

118
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,024
You look a little lost.

119
00:15:10,024 --> 00:15:11,079
No, I'm fine.

120
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:12,422
Sure about that?

121
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:17,000
Kind of looking
for this lawyer's office.

122
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,176
Well, Mr. John Petrie,

123
00:15:19,176 --> 00:15:20,360
it's just around
the corner there.

124
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,448
Great, thank you.

125
00:15:21,448 --> 00:15:23,144
If you want my advice,
which you do,

126
00:15:23,144 --> 00:15:26,855
you'll turn around and get
your sorry ass back on that train.

127
00:15:26,855 --> 00:15:27,847
Why would I do that?

128
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:28,903
Listen to him, okay?

129
00:15:28,903 --> 00:15:30,015
Nobody wants you here.

130
00:15:32,135 --> 00:15:34,919
Everything's been fine here
for 17 years.

131
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:37,288
You had no right coming back
and digging up the past!

132
00:15:37,288 --> 00:15:38,597
Listen, I don't know
what you're talking about.

133
00:15:42,055 --> 00:15:43,143
Hey.

134
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,967
Let him go, Mack.

135
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:48,744
Just so we're clear,
you don't belong in this town.

136
00:15:48,744 --> 00:15:50,020
Understand?

137
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:54,912
See you around.

138
00:16:17,734 --> 00:16:21,605
So, I'm glad you were able
to come up here so quickly.

139
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,174
The sooner we get
the ball rolling,

140
00:16:23,174 --> 00:16:26,086
the sooner both of us can be
on our way to the bank.

141
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:27,330
Uh-huh.

142
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:30,556
Your mother was okay
with you coming up here?

143
00:16:33,254 --> 00:16:36,036
Well, it's not like she really has
any say in what I do.

144
00:16:40,197 --> 00:16:41,893
Mr. Judson, I've still got
a few questions.

145
00:16:41,893 --> 00:16:43,868
Ah, here we are.

146
00:16:58,245 --> 00:16:59,845
Just look at it.

147
00:16:59,845 --> 00:17:01,220
Okay.

148
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,196
You have the house over here,
barn out back.

149
00:17:04,196 --> 00:17:06,405
Property stretches
far into the woods over there

150
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:09,307
covering approximately
125 acres.

151
00:17:10,117 --> 00:17:12,133
- Mr. Judson--
- I already have a developer lined up

152
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:14,052
who's been waiting years
to get a hold of the property.

153
00:17:14,052 --> 00:17:16,036
So, I was able to negotiate
a great price--

154
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:17,149
pending your approval.

155
00:17:20,965 --> 00:17:23,140
Wait, can you just--
hold on a second.

156
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,740
Yeah, what is it?

157
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,500
Who is Benjamin Conroy?

158
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,412
I'm sorry, I just--
I just thought you knew.

159
00:17:29,412 --> 00:17:30,884
No.

160
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,516
You should really talk
to your mother about this.

161
00:17:32,516 --> 00:17:33,860
Trust me, it's not my place.

162
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,717
Look, I tried--
she wouldn't tell me.

163
00:17:35,717 --> 00:17:37,443
More reason for me
not to get involved.

164
00:17:37,443 --> 00:17:39,652
Please, I'm just trying
to figure out why I'm here.

165
00:17:41,955 --> 00:17:44,411
Because you're next of kin
to the Conroy family.

166
00:17:45,604 --> 00:17:47,043
Next of kin?

167
00:17:47,043 --> 00:17:49,148
Was Benjamin
like a c-c-c cousin or somethin'?

168
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:52,739
No, not a cousin.

169
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,016
Well, what then?

170
00:17:56,803 --> 00:17:59,364
Benjamin Conroy was--

171
00:17:59,364 --> 00:18:01,054
Benjamin Conroy was your father.

172
00:18:03,075 --> 00:18:04,931
See, I knew this had
to be a mistake.

173
00:18:04,931 --> 00:18:07,298
My father's name was Ed Petrie,
he died years ago.

174
00:18:07,298 --> 00:18:10,243
Your mother...
was Benjamin's sister.

175
00:18:10,243 --> 00:18:12,315
She adopted you after
your family passed away.

176
00:18:13,379 --> 00:18:15,299
That's impossible,
I'd remember something like that.

177
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:16,673
You were only a year old.

178
00:18:21,218 --> 00:18:23,607
I'm sorry you had
to find out like this.

179
00:18:29,219 --> 00:18:30,402
Hey.

180
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:31,810
I don't know how tame he is.

181
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,834
Get outta here!

182
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:36,418
Get, go, go,
get outta here, go, go!

183
00:18:36,418 --> 00:18:38,434
You okay,
he didn't hurt you?

184
00:18:38,434 --> 00:18:39,546
No, I'm fine.

185
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,192
Let's go see the house.

186
00:18:48,322 --> 00:18:49,566
All right.

187
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,938
Had the power turned on
for showing the buyers.

188
00:18:55,938 --> 00:18:58,657
I also had an antiques dealer
put a quote together,

189
00:18:58,657 --> 00:19:00,833
assuming you want
to sell the furniture.

190
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,353
Minus a small percentage
for my finder's fee.

191
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:06,039
Is this my family?

192
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,631
Yes, I suppose so.

193
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:11,929
What happened to them?

194
00:19:14,273 --> 00:19:15,457
Mr. Judson?

195
00:19:15,457 --> 00:19:18,336
Honestly, I really don't know
that much about it.

196
00:19:18,336 --> 00:19:19,798
Some kinda accident.

197
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,816
I have a four o'clock,
so we need to get going.

198
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:32,507
- Already?
- Yeah.

199
00:19:34,816 --> 00:19:38,016
So, the property was
originally made in 1816.

200
00:19:38,016 --> 00:19:40,001
Back then it sat on 400 acres.

201
00:19:40,001 --> 00:19:41,756
It was originally farm country.

202
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:51,487
So, I booked you a room
at the hotel by my office.

203
00:19:51,487 --> 00:19:54,422
So, we can meet tomorrow morning
and go over all the paperwork.

204
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,672
Actually...I was kind of thinkin'
that I might like to stay here

205
00:20:00,672 --> 00:20:02,494
for a little longer.

206
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,831
Is that okay?

207
00:20:04,831 --> 00:20:06,080
I mean, it is your house,

208
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,096
but I wouldn't suggest
poking around in there.

209
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:09,279
Why not?

210
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,313
It's just...it's not sanitary.

211
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,192
I'd like to stay.

212
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,652
I mean, I'm staying.

213
00:20:19,775 --> 00:20:21,086
Fine.

214
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,327
Okay, here's my card,

215
00:20:23,327 --> 00:20:25,790
the number for a cab service.

216
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,095
Give 'em a call
when you're done,

217
00:20:28,095 --> 00:20:30,517
assuming you haven't caught
some sort of hepatitis by then.

218
00:20:35,647 --> 00:20:36,831
Enjoy.

219
00:20:36,831 --> 00:20:38,325
- Thank you.
- I guess.

220
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:43,166
Oh, and uh, Johnny...
happy birthday.

221
00:23:05,754 --> 00:23:07,063
Ow!

222
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,166
Great.

223
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:54,649
Hello?

224
00:23:54,649 --> 00:23:56,569
Hi, John, it's Andrew Judson.

225
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:58,552
I just called to let you know
I had the line turned back on.

226
00:23:58,552 --> 00:24:00,121
Oh, okay.

227
00:24:00,121 --> 00:24:01,528
Thanks, Mr. Judson.

228
00:24:01,528 --> 00:24:03,161
Is everything all right?

229
00:24:03,161 --> 00:24:04,728
Yeah, everything's fine.

230
00:24:04,728 --> 00:24:06,840
Okay, give me a call
if you need anything.

231
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,312
All right, I will.

232
00:24:08,312 --> 00:24:09,560
I'll see you tomorrow.

233
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,837
Sounds good, thank you.

234
00:24:19,193 --> 00:24:20,469
Hello?

235
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:23,664
Bryan Conroy.

236
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:46,991
Who's up there?

237
00:27:18,674 --> 00:27:19,689
Hey!

238
00:27:27,474 --> 00:27:28,620
Hello?

239
00:27:49,713 --> 00:27:51,698
Can I help you?

240
00:27:51,698 --> 00:27:53,389
I'm sorry I scared you.

241
00:27:54,865 --> 00:27:56,626
I didn't think anyone
would be coming back,

242
00:27:56,626 --> 00:27:58,152
so I kinda panicked.

243
00:27:59,186 --> 00:28:00,306
Okay.

244
00:28:00,306 --> 00:28:02,673
Though technically, I think
you're the one who barged in on me,

245
00:28:02,673 --> 00:28:04,817
so I don't think I should be
the one apologizing.

246
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:06,385
Why, I didn't barge in, I--

247
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:08,081
You didn't exactly knock either,
did you?

248
00:28:08,081 --> 00:28:09,361
No, I didn't knock--

249
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:11,946
Well, now that we've established that,
I'll be upstairs.

250
00:28:13,297 --> 00:28:14,738
Hey!

251
00:28:14,738 --> 00:28:16,114
Uh, who are you?

252
00:28:16,114 --> 00:28:18,704
See, I should be asking you
the same question.

253
00:28:18,704 --> 00:28:21,553
- Yeah, but this is my house.
- And?

254
00:28:21,553 --> 00:28:23,346
Not looking for a roommate?

255
00:28:23,346 --> 00:28:26,032
Not exactly, I'm supposed
to be selling it tomorrow.

256
00:28:26,032 --> 00:28:28,177
If I wasn't mistaken,
that would be your way

257
00:28:28,177 --> 00:28:30,097
of telling me I had to leave.

258
00:28:30,097 --> 00:28:32,113
Kind of-- sorry.

259
00:28:32,113 --> 00:28:33,193
No worries.

260
00:28:34,705 --> 00:28:35,784
Whatever.

261
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:39,272
- No, wait, slow down.
- No, thanks.

262
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,255
Do you have a name?

263
00:28:42,192 --> 00:28:43,824
I'm not a stray cat.

264
00:28:43,824 --> 00:28:45,936
Of course I have a name.

265
00:28:45,936 --> 00:28:47,920
Well, what is it?

266
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,025
- Emma.
- Emma, I'm Johnny.

267
00:28:51,025 --> 00:28:52,145
I'm sure you are.

268
00:28:52,145 --> 00:28:53,457
So, you've been living here?

269
00:28:53,457 --> 00:28:55,377
- You can say that.
- Why?

270
00:28:55,377 --> 00:28:58,576
It's been abandoned for years,
I didn't think anyone would mind.

271
00:28:58,576 --> 00:29:00,176
What, did you run away
or something?

272
00:29:00,176 --> 00:29:01,584
Something.

273
00:29:01,584 --> 00:29:02,631
Do you have anywhere to go?

274
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:04,970
All right, enough.

275
00:29:05,264 --> 00:29:07,600
- What?
- With the questions, okay?

276
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,839
I'm sorry, I didn't expect
anybody to be here.

277
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,199
Well, I'm leaving, so you can go ahead
and pretend like it never happened.

278
00:29:13,199 --> 00:29:14,093
Emma.

279
00:29:15,343 --> 00:29:16,270
What?

280
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:21,199
Would you mind showing me
around the place before you take off?

281
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:23,053
I think you can handle it yourself.

282
00:29:23,823 --> 00:29:25,038
Please?

283
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:26,315
I'd really appreciate it.

284
00:29:27,504 --> 00:29:29,226
I suppose.

285
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:32,143
Guess we'll start
with the basement.

286
00:29:32,143 --> 00:29:33,899
I saw some bulbs
down there a while back.

287
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:39,438
So, how long have you been here?

288
00:29:39,438 --> 00:29:40,654
I don't know, a day or two.

289
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:42,094
Watch your step.

290
00:29:42,094 --> 00:29:45,193
I didn't think I'd witness the return
of the prodigal son, though.

291
00:29:46,062 --> 00:29:47,823
What are you talking about?

292
00:29:47,823 --> 00:29:49,677
You're the long lost Conroy, right?

293
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:52,168
Wait, you know who I am?

294
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,559
The whole town knows
who you are.

295
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,350
Or at least they think they do.

296
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,292
Why do they know about me?

297
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:04,866
Again with the questions.

298
00:30:19,598 --> 00:30:20,940
Hey, Johnny.

299
00:30:31,853 --> 00:30:33,740
- Sorry.
- Relax.

300
00:30:36,397 --> 00:30:38,477
I was probably gonna be here
for a few more hours,

301
00:30:38,477 --> 00:30:39,916
if you wanted to stick around.

302
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:41,029
I don't know.

303
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:44,012
To be honest,
I could use the company.

304
00:30:44,012 --> 00:30:45,606
I don't really know anybody
around here.

305
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,286
Guess I don't have
anything else to do.

306
00:30:53,996 --> 00:30:56,069
Don't tell me there's somebody else
staying here too.

307
00:30:56,716 --> 00:30:57,764
No.

308
00:31:45,067 --> 00:31:46,376
Is there anybody up here?

309
00:32:09,258 --> 00:32:10,794
The upstairs is empty.

310
00:32:10,794 --> 00:32:12,554
Looks like the door blew open.

311
00:32:12,554 --> 00:32:14,314
Oh.

312
00:32:14,314 --> 00:32:18,536
Johnny...
do you believe in ghosts?

313
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,593
You should see
your face right now.

314
00:32:23,593 --> 00:32:25,088
Ohh.

315
00:32:47,113 --> 00:32:48,226
Emma.

316
00:33:06,344 --> 00:33:07,784
Hey.

317
00:33:07,784 --> 00:33:09,353
You can smoke in the house
if you want to.

318
00:33:09,353 --> 00:33:11,840
- I don't care.
- Shut up, I don't smoke.

319
00:33:13,512 --> 00:33:14,625
Give me a push.

320
00:33:23,336 --> 00:33:25,065
Have you been in the barn?

321
00:33:25,065 --> 00:33:27,272
Gross, no.

322
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:29,345
Just looking at it gives me tetanus.

323
00:33:32,712 --> 00:33:34,686
So, what are you going to do
when you sell this place?

324
00:33:36,104 --> 00:33:39,144
Probably head back to the city,
finish school.

325
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:40,647
Maybe use the money
to go to college.

326
00:33:40,647 --> 00:33:42,023
You're from New York?

327
00:33:42,023 --> 00:33:43,816
Yeah, born and raised.

328
00:33:43,816 --> 00:33:46,311
Well, raised.

329
00:33:46,311 --> 00:33:47,358
Don't you love it?

330
00:33:48,327 --> 00:33:50,088
You know, I honestly
never got out much,

331
00:33:50,088 --> 00:33:52,104
aside seeing
in school and church.

332
00:33:52,104 --> 00:33:54,308
Jesus, why the hell
do you want to go back?

333
00:33:56,136 --> 00:33:57,346
I don't know.

334
00:33:57,831 --> 00:34:00,700
Guess I always thought
I'd eventually have to.

335
00:34:01,127 --> 00:34:04,094
If I were you, I'd just pick up
and start over.

336
00:34:05,447 --> 00:34:08,936
New town, new place,
new name.

337
00:34:08,936 --> 00:34:10,244
New everything.

338
00:34:11,622 --> 00:34:13,607
Is that what you did?

339
00:34:13,607 --> 00:34:14,686
Come on.

340
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,014
Where?

341
00:34:19,014 --> 00:34:20,869
You said you wanted
to see the barn, right?

342
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,259
It's locked from the inside.

343
00:34:29,574 --> 00:34:30,784
I think I can get in
from the top.

344
00:34:42,662 --> 00:34:44,484
- You comin'?
- Absolutely not.

345
00:34:51,621 --> 00:34:52,701
Caw!

346
00:34:54,373 --> 00:34:55,617
Johnnie?

347
00:34:56,006 --> 00:34:57,052
Yeah.

348
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,636
You gotta see this!

349
00:36:38,979 --> 00:36:40,288
Johnny?

350
00:36:41,251 --> 00:36:42,363
Coming.

351
00:36:54,721 --> 00:36:55,649
What's wrong?

352
00:36:56,641 --> 00:36:57,656
I don't know.

353
00:36:58,657 --> 00:37:00,642
There was someone
behind me.

354
00:37:00,642 --> 00:37:01,689
Who?

355
00:37:04,129 --> 00:37:05,602
Anything upstairs?

356
00:37:05,602 --> 00:37:07,292
No, jus-- just junk.

357
00:37:14,977 --> 00:37:17,213
- We should probably go inside.
- Yeah.

358
00:37:26,848 --> 00:37:28,125
Go on, get away!

359
00:37:30,977 --> 00:37:32,089
Get away!

360
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,772
You owe me one.

361
00:38:09,024 --> 00:38:12,256
Don't step another foot
in this room, you pervert!

362
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:15,671
Michael Coffit, please call 8-4-0.

363
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:23,743
You've reached the Petrie's.

364
00:38:23,743 --> 00:38:25,855
Please leave your name
and a brief message

365
00:38:25,855 --> 00:38:28,383
and have a blessed day.

366
00:38:28,383 --> 00:38:30,975
Johnny, this is your mother again.

367
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,863
I don't know what kind
of joke you're playing,

368
00:38:32,863 --> 00:38:34,463
but I expect you here first thing
in the morning

369
00:38:34,463 --> 00:38:35,837
to get me out of this place!

370
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:47,615
So, do you know anything
about my family?

371
00:38:47,615 --> 00:38:48,927
That depends.

372
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:50,334
What do you already know?

373
00:38:50,334 --> 00:38:51,676
That there was an accident.

374
00:38:52,223 --> 00:38:54,526
I wouldn't exactly say that.

375
00:38:54,526 --> 00:38:56,255
Well, what happened then?

376
00:38:56,255 --> 00:38:58,294
How should I know,
it's your family not mine.

377
00:38:59,646 --> 00:39:00,766
I don't know.

378
00:39:00,766 --> 00:39:03,995
I just felt connected to this place
from the second I got here.

379
00:39:06,014 --> 00:39:09,182
There is this strong,
tragic energy, right?

380
00:39:09,182 --> 00:39:11,454
Just looking at the photos
you can tell.

381
00:39:11,454 --> 00:39:13,723
At one point the Conroys
were happy.

382
00:39:17,662 --> 00:39:20,158
Listen, it's getting pretty late.

383
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:21,534
I get it, time to go.

384
00:39:21,534 --> 00:39:25,277
No, wait, I was gonna say
I'm spending the night, so...

385
00:39:25,277 --> 00:39:26,936
if you wanted to stay another day.

386
00:39:27,773 --> 00:39:29,117
Thanks.

387
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,366
You're welcome.

388
00:39:30,366 --> 00:39:31,517
What's wrong?

389
00:39:31,517 --> 00:39:34,781
You know how I said I-- I thought I saw
someone outside earlier?

390
00:39:34,781 --> 00:39:36,155
I think they're back.

391
00:39:41,021 --> 00:39:42,712
- Did you hear that?
- Sh-hh.

392
00:40:31,452 --> 00:40:34,940
Go ahead, Mack, let 'em know
who's house this is!

393
00:40:36,315 --> 00:40:38,363
Why don't you come out,
Mr. John Petrie?

394
00:40:38,363 --> 00:40:39,963
We ain't gonna hurt you!

395
00:40:39,963 --> 00:40:41,756
What, you gotta be kidding me.

396
00:40:41,756 --> 00:40:43,097
Wait, what are you gonna do?

397
00:40:43,964 --> 00:40:45,109
I'm calling the cops.

398
00:40:47,483 --> 00:40:49,340
Open up, buddy!

399
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,556
We just wanna hang out!

400
00:40:50,556 --> 00:40:52,859
There are people trying
to break into my house.

401
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:54,458
No, I'm not sure
of the address exactly.

402
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:55,610
It's-- it's the Conroy farm.

403
00:40:56,603 --> 00:40:58,171
There's things you need to know.

404
00:40:58,171 --> 00:40:59,674
So, let us in this house.

405
00:40:59,674 --> 00:41:01,714
I just need you guys to send
somebody right away, please.

406
00:41:15,963 --> 00:41:17,108
What are you looking at?

407
00:41:18,842 --> 00:41:19,922
Mack?

408
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,538
It's for the good of us all.

409
00:41:24,538 --> 00:41:25,529
What?

410
00:41:25,529 --> 00:41:26,810
Thank you.

411
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,271
Okay, they should be here soon.

412
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:31,827
Emma?

413
00:41:35,482 --> 00:41:36,857
Where'd you go?

414
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:40,784
Oh, fuck.

415
00:41:42,778 --> 00:41:44,687
Mack, we gotta bail.

416
00:41:45,913 --> 00:41:47,161
What, why?

417
00:41:47,161 --> 00:41:48,282
There's someone out back.

418
00:41:48,282 --> 00:41:49,492
Yo, Mack, let's go, come on.

419
00:41:54,937 --> 00:41:56,311
Emma, is that you?

420
00:42:27,032 --> 00:42:28,952
You shouldn't a come back here.

421
00:42:28,952 --> 00:42:31,570
You let them out, you know that,
you let them out!

422
00:42:35,736 --> 00:42:38,070
All right, Henry, let's go,
come on, it's gettin' late.

423
00:42:42,167 --> 00:42:43,476
No, no.

424
00:42:44,888 --> 00:42:46,066
Watch your step.

425
00:42:47,032 --> 00:42:48,592
There you go.

426
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:51,733
Nice and easy now, okay?

427
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,911
We're just gonna
take him down to the station

428
00:42:53,911 --> 00:42:55,668
and throw him
in the drunk tank for the night.

429
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:57,650
Who-- who is he?

430
00:42:58,391 --> 00:43:00,725
Henry Depford,
he used to be a sheriff up here.

431
00:43:01,431 --> 00:43:03,406
Honestly, he's a pretty harmless guy.

432
00:43:04,854 --> 00:43:06,200
You might want to tell him that.

433
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,599
I think he wasjust trying
to scare you, is all.

434
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:11,730
Well, Henry became pretty
obsessed with this place,

435
00:43:11,927 --> 00:43:14,007
uh, after he discovered
the bodies in the barn.

436
00:43:14,007 --> 00:43:15,414
He found the bodies?

437
00:43:15,414 --> 00:43:17,654
Yeah, Bryan, he's the one who found you
hidden in the basement that night.

438
00:43:17,654 --> 00:43:18,774
I'm sorry, what did you call me?

439
00:43:18,774 --> 00:43:19,723
You're name's Bryan, right?

440
00:43:20,855 --> 00:43:22,797
Yeah, right, I'm sorry, I'm just, um--

441
00:43:23,895 --> 00:43:24,887
a little on edge.

442
00:43:24,887 --> 00:43:26,071
I can understand that.

443
00:43:26,071 --> 00:43:27,085
You stayin' up here by yourself?

444
00:43:29,174 --> 00:43:31,030
Uh, yeah, just for tonight.

445
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:32,119
Right, right.

446
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:34,870
Well, you want to press charges,
you come down to the station tomorrow--

447
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:35,894
No, no, it's okay.

448
00:43:35,894 --> 00:43:37,654
Uh, can you just make sure
that he doesn't come back?

449
00:43:37,654 --> 00:43:38,710
I'll have a talk with him.

450
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:40,277
- Thank you.
- All right?

451
00:43:40,277 --> 00:43:41,587
Be careful up here, all right?

452
00:44:00,245 --> 00:44:01,739
Eventful evening.

453
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:08,053
Hey, why did you disappear?

454
00:44:08,053 --> 00:44:09,718
Wow, what?

455
00:44:09,718 --> 00:44:11,026
Been here the whole time.

456
00:44:11,477 --> 00:44:12,854
No you haven't.

457
00:44:12,854 --> 00:44:14,992
You're right, fine, I lied.

458
00:44:16,117 --> 00:44:17,742
Yeah, you do that a lot,
don't you?

459
00:44:22,805 --> 00:44:24,629
I like you, Johnny.

460
00:44:24,629 --> 00:44:25,839
But you'll never know me.

461
00:44:27,669 --> 00:44:29,555
That doesn't mean
we can't be friends.

462
00:45:08,788 --> 00:45:10,484
Johnny?

463
00:45:10,484 --> 00:45:12,371
- Hi, Mom.
- Where the hell have you been?

464
00:45:12,371 --> 00:45:14,996
I've been trying to get
a hold of you all day.

465
00:45:14,996 --> 00:45:16,243
I'm home, Mom.

466
00:45:16,243 --> 00:45:19,113
Well, get back here immediately
and bring me my prescriptions.

467
00:45:19,411 --> 00:45:21,036
No, I mean I'm in my home--

468
00:45:21,683 --> 00:45:23,731
in Wellfield.

469
00:45:23,731 --> 00:45:26,516
I can't believe you deliberately
disobeyed me like this.

470
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:28,051
You better get back here, Johnny!

471
00:45:28,051 --> 00:45:30,066
No, I can't believe you didn't tell me.

472
00:45:30,066 --> 00:45:32,270
How could you hide the truth
from me about my family?

473
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:36,109
Mom?

474
00:45:37,746 --> 00:45:39,240
You don't understand, Johnny.

475
00:45:42,002 --> 00:45:43,731
Benjamin was an awful man.

476
00:45:43,731 --> 00:45:45,522
I couldn't let you
grow up like that.

477
00:45:45,522 --> 00:45:46,803
So, you lied to me instead?

478
00:45:46,803 --> 00:45:48,083
I didn't lie to you, I just--

479
00:45:48,083 --> 00:45:49,682
just left out the truth?

480
00:45:49,682 --> 00:45:52,048
Just come back here
and we'll discuss this.

481
00:45:53,874 --> 00:45:55,303
I don't know if I'm coming back.

482
00:45:57,650 --> 00:45:59,340
Johnny, please don't do this.

483
00:47:12,912 --> 00:47:14,438
Stupid.

484
00:47:52,687 --> 00:47:54,629
I'm sorry, did I say
you could come in?

485
00:47:57,519 --> 00:47:58,860
Johnny.

486
00:48:00,142 --> 00:48:01,670
That feels good.

487
00:48:27,917 --> 00:48:29,511
Sorry, Bryan.

488
00:49:31,404 --> 00:49:33,095
Save my dying soul.

489
00:49:46,187 --> 00:49:47,755
What's wrong?

490
00:49:47,755 --> 00:49:49,511
You saw something out there,
didn't you?

491
00:49:53,195 --> 00:49:54,307
Yeah.

492
00:50:02,027 --> 00:50:04,777
I didn't hear someone,
just a creak before you got here.

493
00:50:06,538 --> 00:50:08,065
You woke something up.

494
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:10,858
It's my family.

495
00:50:10,858 --> 00:50:12,288
I think they need my help.

496
00:50:13,354 --> 00:50:15,115
Something touched me
in the other room

497
00:50:15,115 --> 00:50:17,835
and it definitely wasn't
asking for help.

498
00:50:17,835 --> 00:50:19,466
Look, I get if you want to leave.

499
00:50:19,466 --> 00:50:22,184
But I'm not going anywhere
until I find out what happened to them.

500
00:50:22,698 --> 00:50:24,226
I never said I was leaving.

501
00:50:48,425 --> 00:50:50,530
You son of a bitch.

502
00:51:17,257 --> 00:51:23,464
# Will you walk into my parlor #

503
00:51:23,464 --> 00:51:27,272
# Said the spider to the fly #

504
00:51:27,272 --> 00:51:32,840
# 'Tis the prettiest little parlor #

505
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,392
# That ever you did spy #

506
00:51:36,392 --> 00:51:41,864
# The way into my parlor #

507
00:51:41,864 --> 00:51:45,353
# Is up a winding stair #

508
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:50,792
# And I have many
curious little things #

509
00:51:50,792 --> 00:51:54,952
# To show you when you're there #

510
00:51:54,952 --> 00:51:57,959
# Oh no no said the fly #

511
00:51:57,959 --> 00:52:00,775
# To ask me is in vain #

512
00:52:00,775 --> 00:52:03,655
# For who goes up
your winding stair... #

513
00:52:03,655 --> 00:52:05,378
...can never come down again.

514
00:52:09,383 --> 00:52:13,735
# I'm sure you must be weary dear #

515
00:52:13,735 --> 00:52:16,997
# With soaring up so high #

516
00:52:17,991 --> 00:52:23,622
# Will you rest upon my little bed #

517
00:52:23,622 --> 00:52:27,398
# Said the spider to the fly #

518
00:52:27,398 --> 00:52:32,198
# There are pretty curtains
drawn around #

519
00:52:32,198 --> 00:52:36,071
# The sheets are fine and thin #

520
00:52:36,071 --> 00:52:41,510
# And if you like to rest awhile #

521
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:44,998
# I'll snugly tuck you in #

522
00:52:44,998 --> 00:52:47,974
# Oh no no said the fly #

523
00:52:47,974 --> 00:52:50,214
# For I've often heard it said #

524
00:52:50,214 --> 00:52:53,563
# They never never wake again. #

525
00:52:57,509 --> 00:52:59,419
You sleep upon your bed.

526
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:22,040
Osiris.

527
00:54:59,458 --> 00:55:00,538
Emma?

528
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:08,536
Emma?

529
00:55:11,746 --> 00:55:13,240
Emma, is that you?

530
00:55:18,658 --> 00:55:20,218
Emma, what the hell
are you doing?

531
00:55:50,049 --> 00:55:51,259
Are you sure about this?

532
00:56:05,344 --> 00:56:06,905
Missed you, brother.

533
00:56:10,432 --> 00:56:11,479
Emma?

534
00:56:12,352 --> 00:56:13,661
What just happened?

535
00:57:41,726 --> 00:57:44,060
You don't actually believe
any of this stuff, do you?

536
00:57:45,725 --> 00:57:46,813
I don't know.

537
00:57:46,813 --> 00:57:49,147
It-- it might have something to do
with what happened to my family.

538
00:58:15,772 --> 00:58:17,404
Oh!

539
00:58:17,404 --> 00:58:19,260
Johnny, what's wrong?

540
00:58:25,371 --> 00:58:26,746
Grab the other side.

541
00:58:45,148 --> 00:58:46,424
You okay?

542
00:58:52,092 --> 00:58:54,972
I evoke thee,
oh God of Osiris

543
00:58:54,972 --> 00:58:58,681
in the virtue of the most holy
sacrament, Jesus Christ.

544
00:58:59,099 --> 00:59:04,379
Who, for our redemption,
was crucified, suffered death,

545
00:59:04,379 --> 00:59:07,098
was buried, and rose on the 3rd day

546
00:59:07,098 --> 00:59:10,414
by the power of the spirit
of the God Osiris.

547
00:59:11,867 --> 00:59:13,339
We pray to thee, oh Lords.

548
00:59:13,339 --> 00:59:14,418
Amen.

549
00:59:15,419 --> 00:59:16,730
Amen.

550
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:17,778
Amen.

551
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:37,882
I, Benjamin,

552
00:59:37,882 --> 00:59:41,013
share the gift of the afterlife

553
00:59:41,626 --> 00:59:43,130
with Bryan.

554
00:59:57,497 --> 00:59:59,866
I, Elizabeth,

555
00:59:59,866 --> 01:00:02,254
share the gift of the afterlife
with Bryan.

556
01:00:09,337 --> 01:00:11,065
I, Faith,

557
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:14,131
share the gift of the afterlife
with Bryan.

558
01:00:40,248 --> 01:00:41,175
Daniel?

559
01:00:43,704 --> 01:00:46,136
- Say it, Daniel.
-Johnny!

560
01:00:46,136 --> 01:00:48,111
Johnny!
What happened?

561
01:00:48,888 --> 01:00:52,088
It was-- they were--
they were all right here, all of them.

562
01:00:52,088 --> 01:00:53,528
- Calm down, okay?
- No.

563
01:00:53,528 --> 01:00:54,840
There's no one here but us.

564
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,343
Just you and me.

565
01:00:56,343 --> 01:00:57,976
It was right in front of me,
I could feel it.

566
01:00:57,976 --> 01:00:59,704
I could feel his breath
on my face.

567
01:00:59,704 --> 01:01:03,288
Just you and me, hear me?

568
01:02:04,886 --> 01:02:06,102
What is it?

569
01:02:06,102 --> 01:02:07,084
Do you hearthat?

570
01:02:22,293 --> 01:02:24,405
- Mr. Judson.
- Are you okay?

571
01:02:24,405 --> 01:02:26,614
Yeah, I'm fine.

572
01:02:26,614 --> 01:02:27,797
I called the hotel this morning.

573
01:02:27,797 --> 01:02:29,045
They said you never
even checked in.

574
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:32,886
You-- you know, I lost track of time
and I decided to crash here.

575
01:02:32,886 --> 01:02:34,827
Well, it would have been helpful
if you'd called to let me know.

576
01:02:36,532 --> 01:02:37,557
You're right, I'm sorry.

577
01:02:37,557 --> 01:02:38,677
I should have.

578
01:02:38,677 --> 01:02:41,013
All right, well,
we're both here now.

579
01:02:41,013 --> 01:02:42,835
What do you say
we get down to business?

580
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:46,675
Um, sure.
Come on in.

581
01:02:59,156 --> 01:03:00,204
Hold on, hold on.

582
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:18,292
The offer's well above
market value.

583
01:03:18,292 --> 01:03:20,595
So, probably, if I were you,

584
01:03:20,595 --> 01:03:22,734
I wouldn't even
bother negotiating.

585
01:03:24,724 --> 01:03:26,993
Just sign it,
be done with this dump.

586
01:03:28,531 --> 01:03:30,739
Yeah, I mean,
I'm sure it's great.

587
01:03:30,739 --> 01:03:33,139
Trust me, if you're holding out
for something better to come along,

588
01:03:33,139 --> 01:03:35,858
it will not be happening
in this economy.

589
01:03:35,858 --> 01:03:38,770
I trust you,
it's just I'm not really sure.

590
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:42,035
I know, real estate can seem
like a daunting task sometimes.

591
01:03:42,035 --> 01:03:44,752
But that's why I'm here,
walk you through it.

592
01:03:48,498 --> 01:03:50,483
What if I didn't want
to sell the house?

593
01:03:50,483 --> 01:03:51,730
Excuse me?

594
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:54,771
I just-- I sort of feel obligated
to keep it.

595
01:03:54,771 --> 01:03:56,274
It's my family's home.

596
01:03:56,274 --> 01:03:58,130
Johnny, you didn't even
know them.

597
01:03:58,130 --> 01:03:59,571
Yeah, I know that.

598
01:03:59,571 --> 01:04:02,482
Listen, kid, I took on this case
under the agreement

599
01:04:02,482 --> 01:04:03,911
that I receive a percentage
of the sale.

600
01:04:05,522 --> 01:04:06,834
I'm sorry, Mr. Judson.

601
01:04:06,834 --> 01:04:09,452
Then maybe you should rethink
making such a detrimental decision.

602
01:04:16,850 --> 01:04:18,890
This is the last thing
that I need.

603
01:04:20,402 --> 01:04:21,650
Who is that?

604
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:22,961
He's been harassing me.

605
01:04:22,961 --> 01:04:24,690
That's David Mackey.

606
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:26,033
Mack.

607
01:04:26,033 --> 01:04:29,969
Guess you could say he's your, uh...
half brother.

608
01:04:29,969 --> 01:04:30,918
What?

609
01:04:31,794 --> 01:04:35,569
Benjamin wasn't exactly the most...
faithful husband.

610
01:04:35,569 --> 01:04:37,361
But don't worry, he doesn't have
any claim to the estate.

611
01:04:37,361 --> 01:04:38,506
I'll handle it.

612
01:04:41,649 --> 01:04:42,827
My brother?

613
01:04:43,601 --> 01:04:45,650
Hey, David.

614
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:47,761
Yeah, this really isn't the time
or the place--

615
01:04:47,761 --> 01:04:48,753
I just want to talk to him.

616
01:04:48,753 --> 01:04:51,313
Yeah, from what I understand
you already talked to him yesterday.

617
01:04:51,313 --> 01:04:52,433
I want to talk to Bryan.

618
01:04:52,433 --> 01:04:54,768
Uh, yeah, he goes by Johnny now.

619
01:04:54,768 --> 01:04:56,017
I want to talk to Bryan.

620
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,162
Where'd Daniel put him?

621
01:05:00,049 --> 01:05:02,416
We can arrange a time,
a place, that's fine.

622
01:05:02,416 --> 01:05:04,208
Give me the baby, Daniel.

623
01:05:04,208 --> 01:05:05,361
Excuse me?

624
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,560
No, there's one more.

625
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:11,760
David, you really need
to get going now.

626
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,320
- Hi.
- Hey.

627
01:05:15,088 --> 01:05:16,592
What's going on?

628
01:05:16,592 --> 01:05:17,770
I'm not sure.

629
01:05:18,961 --> 01:05:21,200
Give me the baby, Daniel!

630
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,959
Bullshit!

631
01:05:22,959 --> 01:05:24,048
Oh, my God.

632
01:05:24,048 --> 01:05:25,200
David.

633
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,607
It has to be finished.

634
01:05:35,567 --> 01:05:36,975
Jesus!

635
01:05:47,696 --> 01:05:49,005
Bryan!

636
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:10,504
Behind the door.

637
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:17,382
Emma!

638
01:06:20,174 --> 01:06:23,279
Hey, just-- just let her go.

639
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:24,805
I don't want her.

640
01:06:26,606 --> 01:06:27,915
There's one more.

641
01:06:53,357 --> 01:06:55,277
Help me, please!

642
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:56,813
I'm sorry!

643
01:06:56,813 --> 01:06:58,733
Save our souls, Bryan!

644
01:06:58,733 --> 01:07:00,643
Ah!

645
01:07:12,492 --> 01:07:14,157
Hey, are you okay?

646
01:07:14,157 --> 01:07:15,532
Yeah, are you okay?

647
01:07:16,909 --> 01:07:18,476
He's dead.

648
01:07:18,476 --> 01:07:19,757
We gotta call the cops.

649
01:07:19,757 --> 01:07:20,909
You can't.

650
01:07:20,909 --> 01:07:22,285
We have to.

651
01:07:22,285 --> 01:07:23,430
No, Johnny, you can't.

652
01:07:26,892 --> 01:07:28,557
Judson had a--
had a cell phone.

653
01:07:28,557 --> 01:07:29,767
I'll go get it.

654
01:07:43,723 --> 01:07:45,228
He was right there.

655
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:47,432
Come on, Johnny,
let's go inside.

656
01:07:50,764 --> 01:07:51,690
Hey!

657
01:07:52,811 --> 01:07:53,964
What are you doing back?

658
01:07:53,964 --> 01:07:56,428
What the hell did you do
with the bodies out there?

659
01:07:56,428 --> 01:07:57,802
I didn't touch the bodies.

660
01:08:07,403 --> 01:08:08,908
What's going on?

661
01:08:08,908 --> 01:08:10,603
Look, I've been
investigating this case

662
01:08:10,603 --> 01:08:12,969
since even after they forced me
into retirement.

663
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:16,170
So, you know what happened?

664
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:18,572
Yeah, I was there.

665
01:08:18,572 --> 01:08:21,195
Your father was convinced
that there was a code in the Bible

666
01:08:21,195 --> 01:08:24,043
that-- that somehow linked
the resurrection of Jesus

667
01:08:24,043 --> 01:08:26,091
to the Egyptian God Osiris--

668
01:08:26,091 --> 01:08:28,164
that he used it to rise
from the dead.

669
01:08:29,066 --> 01:08:30,922
I found his Bible last night.

670
01:08:30,922 --> 01:08:32,682
Well, there was only one problem.

671
01:08:32,682 --> 01:08:34,282
They never completed the ritual.

672
01:08:34,282 --> 01:08:37,930
And so your family
is now trapped in limbo.

673
01:08:37,930 --> 01:08:39,140
Wait!

674
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:41,162
Why?

675
01:08:41,162 --> 01:08:42,634
They want the last survivor.

676
01:08:42,634 --> 01:08:44,074
Look, trust me.

677
01:08:44,074 --> 01:08:46,090
Until they have finished
what they've started,

678
01:08:46,090 --> 01:08:47,722
their souls can't move on.

679
01:08:47,722 --> 01:08:49,866
Your father told me
there was one more.

680
01:08:49,866 --> 01:08:52,553
One more?
That's what Mack said.

681
01:08:52,553 --> 01:08:54,569
Right now, they're out
looking for hosts.

682
01:08:54,569 --> 01:08:57,130
Now, the living,
they're very hard to control.

683
01:08:57,130 --> 01:08:59,136
But the dead,
free for the taking.

684
01:09:00,106 --> 01:09:01,354
What can I do to help?

685
01:09:01,354 --> 01:09:04,393
Years ago,
your brother Daniel saved your life

686
01:09:04,393 --> 01:09:06,089
by hiding you in the basement.

687
01:09:06,089 --> 01:09:09,351
And maybe if we contact him,
he'll do it again.

688
01:09:40,201 --> 01:09:41,477
Something's happening.

689
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:43,360
What?

690
01:09:45,353 --> 01:09:47,589
Oh, we better hurry.

691
01:10:26,662 --> 01:10:28,572
We need
the quality of the sitters.

692
01:10:30,823 --> 01:10:32,416
Something that belongs to us.

693
01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:05,316
And the purpose.

694
01:11:14,278 --> 01:11:15,390
Now what?

695
01:11:16,485 --> 01:11:20,742
The dead sometimes send a marker
to connect them to the living.

696
01:11:20,742 --> 01:11:22,596
Um, a gift.

697
01:11:23,461 --> 01:11:25,795
Did you receive
anything like that?

698
01:11:45,861 --> 01:11:49,505
Well, we couldn't have picked
a better location.

699
01:11:53,444 --> 01:11:55,778
Well, do we hold hands now
or something?

700
01:11:58,405 --> 01:12:03,041
No, uh...
wejust wait.

701
01:12:09,508 --> 01:12:11,134
Daniel, are you there?

702
01:12:22,435 --> 01:12:23,580
Daniel?

703
01:12:24,804 --> 01:12:28,068
Daniel, it's me, Bryan.

704
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:35,774
Daniel, we want to help you.

705
01:12:39,139 --> 01:12:40,153
He's here.

706
01:12:40,675 --> 01:12:42,649
Daniel, show us
how we can help you.

707
01:13:04,802 --> 01:13:06,012
Daniel, please.

708
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:26,432
Fifth what?

709
01:13:47,393 --> 01:13:49,666
Fifth nail, what does that mean?

710
01:13:49,666 --> 01:13:51,136
I've heard about it before--

711
01:13:51,136 --> 01:13:53,441
in school-- it-- it--
it's supposed to go in the heart

712
01:13:53,441 --> 01:13:55,713
during a crucifixion
to end suffering.

713
01:13:55,713 --> 01:13:57,153
It was withheld from Jesus.

714
01:13:57,153 --> 01:14:00,501
They Conroys only had...
four nails each.

715
01:14:01,985 --> 01:14:03,840
There's one more.

716
01:14:05,792 --> 01:14:08,320
It wasn't you, it was the nail.

717
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,953
Then why are they
still after me?

718
01:14:09,953 --> 01:14:12,033
Benjamin Conroy

719
01:14:12,033 --> 01:14:15,232
pledged the entire family
to Osiris.

720
01:14:15,232 --> 01:14:17,312
He has to fulfill his promise.

721
01:14:17,312 --> 01:14:18,970
But before he died,

722
01:14:19,777 --> 01:14:22,080
he didn't want
to finish the ritual.

723
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,000
He wanted to end it.

724
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,905
Oh, God,

725
01:14:27,905 --> 01:14:29,184
it worked.

726
01:14:29,184 --> 01:14:30,874
- Don't open it.
- It's my mother.

727
01:14:31,744 --> 01:14:34,400
- Come on.
- Hey, no, no, it's okay.

728
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:37,279
- What are you doing here?
- I needed to see my baby.

729
01:14:37,279 --> 01:14:39,551
I'm so sorry for everything,
I shouldn't have come.

730
01:14:39,551 --> 01:14:41,756
It's okay, it's okay,
everything's gonna be fine.

731
01:14:44,255 --> 01:14:47,712
# Will you walk into my parlor #

732
01:14:47,712 --> 01:14:50,330
# Said the spider to the fly #

733
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:53,055
You're not my mother.

734
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,111
Yes, she is.

735
01:14:54,111 --> 01:14:56,735
I am, Bryan,
I am your mother.

736
01:14:56,735 --> 01:14:58,430
It's time you joined
your real family.

737
01:14:58,430 --> 01:14:59,423
No.

738
01:14:59,423 --> 01:15:01,056
Don't you want to live
for ever, Bryan?

739
01:15:01,056 --> 01:15:03,295
Faith, we can all get
what we want here tonight.

740
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,953
All I want is my baby back.

741
01:15:09,950 --> 01:15:11,860
Share the gift
of the afterlife with me.

742
01:15:12,991 --> 01:15:15,129
You're not part of the final step.

743
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:29,973
Come here.

744
01:15:35,742 --> 01:15:36,734
Johnny, come on.

745
01:15:36,734 --> 01:15:38,590
You don't have
to be scared, Bryan.

746
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:40,150
We're all meant to be together.

747
01:15:41,277 --> 01:15:44,990
I just want to hold
my baby boy again.

748
01:15:44,990 --> 01:15:45,982
Come with us.

749
01:15:50,109 --> 01:15:51,419
Get off!

750
01:15:53,534 --> 01:15:54,908
Everything's gonna be okay.

751
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:07,415
Uh!

752
01:16:12,157 --> 01:16:13,269
Go, go, go, go.

753
01:16:28,157 --> 01:16:29,531
- We can go around.
- Okay.

754
01:16:31,708 --> 01:16:32,722
Now.

755
01:17:05,852 --> 01:17:07,259
Do you still have
those matches?

756
01:17:07,292 --> 01:17:08,371
Yeah.

757
01:17:09,628 --> 01:17:10,773
Okay.

758
01:17:15,419 --> 01:17:16,695
Now, get ready to run.

759
01:17:19,546 --> 01:17:20,539
- Ready?
- Yeah.

760
01:17:20,539 --> 01:17:21,521
Now!

761
01:17:28,090 --> 01:17:29,306
- Guy, come on.
- Spray him.

762
01:17:29,306 --> 01:17:30,234
Come on!

763
01:18:05,146 --> 01:18:06,291
Let's go!

764
01:18:20,218 --> 01:18:21,265
Go!

765
01:18:28,153 --> 01:18:30,389
The final step!

766
01:18:46,808 --> 01:18:48,150
Let her go!

767
01:18:54,584 --> 01:18:56,209
Good night, little brother.

768
01:19:07,448 --> 01:19:08,658
Emma.

769
01:19:53,110 --> 01:19:54,934
Please stop,
stop, let me go!

770
01:19:54,934 --> 01:19:57,334
Please don't do this!

771
01:19:57,334 --> 01:19:59,862
Don't, please, please,
please, let me go!

772
01:19:59,862 --> 01:20:01,846
Please like...
you don't have to do this.

773
01:20:01,846 --> 01:20:03,446
You don't have to do this,
it's not me.

774
01:20:03,446 --> 01:20:04,854
It's not me, it's the fifth nail!

775
01:20:04,854 --> 01:20:06,646
Daniel understands.
Please?

776
01:20:06,646 --> 01:20:08,470
You're making a mistake.

777
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:10,646
Stop, stop!

778
01:20:10,646 --> 01:20:13,365
Mom, Mom, let me go,
you don't need to do this.

779
01:20:13,365 --> 01:20:16,054
You're making a mistake,
please stop.

780
01:20:16,054 --> 01:20:17,334
Benjamin.

781
01:20:17,334 --> 01:20:20,022
Ben-- Dad, please,
Dad, please just stop!

782
01:20:20,022 --> 01:20:21,622
I can help you,
you don't have to do this.

783
01:20:21,622 --> 01:20:22,709
Just let me go!

784
01:20:22,709 --> 01:20:24,693
Please, please, just stop--

785
01:20:28,021 --> 01:20:29,493
Please?

786
01:20:29,493 --> 01:20:31,894
You don't have to do this.

787
01:20:31,894 --> 01:20:35,276
Mom, just let me go,
let me go, I can help you.

788
01:20:37,749 --> 01:20:38,868
Oh, God.

789
01:20:38,868 --> 01:20:40,789
Emma!

790
01:20:40,789 --> 01:20:43,210
Help, please, somebody!

791
01:20:45,653 --> 01:20:49,301
Just stop, you don't have to do this,
I can save you.

792
01:20:49,301 --> 01:20:51,604
Please, I know how to help you.

793
01:20:51,604 --> 01:20:54,229
I know what to do to save you,
just-- just let me go.

794
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:55,253
You don't have to do this.

795
01:20:55,253 --> 01:20:57,460
It's the fifth nail, it's not me.
Please?

796
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:59,252
Please, please, no, no!

797
01:20:59,252 --> 01:21:01,045
Just stop!

798
01:21:01,045 --> 01:21:02,388
Oh, God!

799
01:21:02,388 --> 01:21:04,885
Please don't, please, please,
please, Mom?

800
01:21:04,885 --> 01:21:06,707
Please, stop.

801
01:21:07,413 --> 01:21:09,779
No, no, please, Mom,
let me go.

802
01:21:09,812 --> 01:21:10,739
Let me go.

803
01:21:14,164 --> 01:21:15,888
Oh, God!

804
01:22:00,883 --> 01:22:02,159
Emma, look out!

805
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:05,330
Emma!

806
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:06,258
No!

807
01:23:09,041 --> 01:23:10,055
Emma.

808
01:23:14,449 --> 01:23:15,758
I can't believe you're okay.

809
01:23:16,336 --> 01:23:18,256
Oh, you saved my life.

810
01:23:18,256 --> 01:23:19,369
I'm sorry.

811
01:23:20,304 --> 01:23:21,711
Emma's gone.

812
01:23:25,968 --> 01:23:27,375
Emma's gone?

813
01:23:29,264 --> 01:23:30,475
Daniel?

814
01:23:36,176 --> 01:23:37,582
Hey, boy.

815
01:23:53,359 --> 01:23:55,399
No more suffering.

816
01:24:01,935 --> 01:24:03,341
Save my soul, Bryan.

817
01:24:05,295 --> 01:24:06,539
I can't.

818
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:08,652
It has to end.

819
01:24:09,807 --> 01:24:11,400
Please don't leave me alone.

820
01:24:17,102 --> 01:24:18,085
I'm sorry.

821
01:25:08,046 --> 01:25:09,833
So, how about you tellin' me
what happened here?

822
01:25:12,812 --> 01:25:14,154
I wouldn't even know
where to start.

823
01:25:17,453 --> 01:25:20,525
Sheriff Depford was
a good friend of mine.

824
01:25:20,525 --> 01:25:24,525
And after his retirement, I kept him
in the loop on the Conroy case.

825
01:25:24,525 --> 01:25:28,205
He shared the evidence
and he gave me his theories.

826
01:25:28,205 --> 01:25:29,252
And I'll tell ya...

827
01:25:30,284 --> 01:25:32,805
I thought
he'd completely lost it.

828
01:25:33,773 --> 01:25:35,245
He wasn't crazy.

829
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:39,852
Well, why don't we get you
to the hospital

830
01:25:39,852 --> 01:25:42,470
and then we can iron out this story
before you talk to anybody else.

831
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:45,285
Thank you.

832
01:25:47,725 --> 01:25:50,764
I'll tell you, kid, I just want to get
you on your way home, that's all.

833
01:25:54,380 --> 01:25:55,395
I am home.
