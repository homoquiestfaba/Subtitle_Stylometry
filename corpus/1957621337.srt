00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:28,549

(ghostly whooshing)

00:02:34,661 --> 00:02:38,213
- [Radio Announcer] KMJW
News and information radio.

4
00:02:38,213 --> 00:02:40,853
It's 7:30 a.m. Friday morning,

5
00:02:40,853 --> 00:02:43,704
we'll see a high of 86
today, plenty of humidity,

6
00:02:43,704 --> 00:02:45,704
and partly cloudy skies.

7
00:02:45,704 --> 00:02:47,443
It will stay warm through the evening,

8
00:02:47,443 --> 00:02:50,493
but then turn much cooler after midnight.

9
00:02:50,493 --> 00:02:53,264
Well, the flood waters
in many area communities

10
00:02:53,264 --> 00:02:55,712
are finally starting to go down.

11
00:02:55,712 --> 00:02:57,603
This means home and business owners are

12
00:02:57,603 --> 00:03:00,064
getting their first
indications of the damage

13
00:03:00,064 --> 00:03:02,181
caused by this disaster.

14
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,584
Unfortunately, it is now evident that

15
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,424
losses are double or sometimes triple

16
00:03:07,424 --> 00:03:09,203
the initial estimates.

17
00:03:09,203 --> 00:03:11,613
As the flood waters continue to recede,

18
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:13,624
property owners are realizing that the

19
00:03:13,624 --> 00:03:16,392
worst visions of chaos and destruction

20
00:03:16,392 --> 00:03:17,962
are yet to be seen.

21
00:03:17,962 --> 00:03:20,962
(upbeat rock music)

22
00:04:02,516 --> 00:04:05,016
(eerie music)

23
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:18,933
(soft guitar music)

24
00:04:43,556 --> 00:04:45,061
- Up until now, we haven't been able to do

25
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:46,882
a whole lot with the place, the old owners

26
00:04:46,882 --> 00:04:49,192
held their last day of
camp just last week,

27
00:04:49,192 --> 00:04:50,533
but now that they're on their way out,

28
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:52,362
we can get ourselves moved in.

29
00:04:52,362 --> 00:04:54,693
However, to start getting organized,

30
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:56,432
we really need to fill the position of

31
00:04:56,432 --> 00:04:58,432
associate camp director.

32
00:04:58,432 --> 00:04:59,565
- Trish, come on.

33
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:00,901
- Mikki, have a heart.

34
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,853
Where else am I gonna find
someone as reliable as you?

35
00:05:03,853 --> 00:05:06,122
It's a true miracle, the
timing of all of this.

36
00:05:06,122 --> 00:05:09,261
Your training in college, and
then an opportunity like this?

37
00:05:09,261 --> 00:05:11,501
- Reliable as you think
I am, I'm still pretty

38
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:13,773
young to be helping
around a children's camp.

39
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:15,661
- Look, you have your
training from college,

40
00:05:15,661 --> 00:05:17,821
so you are qualified, and you've been

41
00:05:17,821 --> 00:05:19,482
coming to Imperial Baptist since you were

42
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:22,421
a baby, so we trust
you, and two months ago,

43
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:23,872
when our Church Sunday pay person bought

44
00:05:23,872 --> 00:05:26,112
this place they had you in mind to

45
00:05:26,112 --> 00:05:27,661
help me run it.

46
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,828
- I know, Trish, I just...

47
00:05:31,202 --> 00:05:34,933
Look, there's gonna be a
lot of kids at this camp,

48
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:36,904
and it's just more responsibility than I'm

49
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:39,032
ready for right now.

50
00:05:39,032 --> 00:05:40,264
- Okay.

51
00:05:40,264 --> 00:05:42,381
Tell you what, things
won't be set in stone

52
00:05:42,381 --> 00:05:44,704
for another few days, so if you do change

53
00:05:44,704 --> 00:05:46,501
your mind, or if you wanna talk to me some

54
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:49,802
more about the job,
just let me know, okay?

55
00:05:49,802 --> 00:05:50,802
- All right.

56
00:05:55,336 --> 00:05:57,869
- Did the girls even
ask Jeff to go with us?

57
00:05:57,869 --> 00:06:00,400
- No, I think Mikki and
Jeff are fightin' again.

58
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,410
- Has Jeff always been a jerk?

59
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,680
- Well, I haven't known
Jeff all that long,

60
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,858
but I think he used to be pretty cool.

61
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:09,379
Of course, then he was born.

62
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:12,046
(water rushing)

63
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,299
(knocking on door)

64
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:20,295
- Hey, Karen?
- Loretta?

65
00:06:20,295 --> 00:06:22,517
Are you guys early, or am I runnin' late?

66
00:06:22,517 --> 00:06:26,684
- We're early, just wanted
to let you know we're here.

67
00:06:27,778 --> 00:06:29,386
- We still have to get Mikki, don't we?

68
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:31,826
- Yeah, we're picking her up at the camp.

69
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:35,337
- Have you, uh, talked
to Mikki's sister lately?

70
00:06:35,337 --> 00:06:36,337
- Mmm, yeah.

71
00:06:37,343 --> 00:06:39,026
A couple weeks ago.

72
00:06:39,026 --> 00:06:41,117
Mikki dropped by to return
some stuff she borrowed,

73
00:06:41,117 --> 00:06:43,218
and Diana was with her.

74
00:06:43,218 --> 00:06:45,226
Why? What's up with Diana?

75
00:06:45,226 --> 00:06:47,893
(phone ringing)

76
00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:52,778
- Hello?

77
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:55,178
Yeah Jeff, what do you need?

78
00:06:55,178 --> 00:06:57,077
Look, Jeff, nobody's sneakin'
round behind your back,

79
00:06:57,077 --> 00:06:58,647
if you wanna know something, just ask me,

80
00:06:58,647 --> 00:07:01,007
don't start in bitchin' about it.

81
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:02,498
Jeff, I have an aunt and uncle who live an

82
00:07:02,498 --> 00:07:04,138
hour south of here, they need some help

83
00:07:04,138 --> 00:07:05,727
cleanin' out an old barn, and they said if

84
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,026
I brought some friends down to help,

85
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:09,646
we can all camp out by
the lake for the weekend.

86
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:11,378
So that is what Mark, Loretta, Nathan,

87
00:07:11,378 --> 00:07:13,247
Mikki, and I are doing.

88
00:07:13,247 --> 00:07:14,527
Is this all right over the phone, Jeff,

89
00:07:14,527 --> 00:07:16,218
or would you like it all in writing?

90
00:07:16,218 --> 00:07:17,957
- Hey, tell him to mind his own business.

91
00:07:17,957 --> 00:07:19,418
- Jeff, we didn't ask you along because

92
00:07:19,418 --> 00:07:21,018
you and Mikki aren't
doing so hot together,

93
00:07:21,018 --> 00:07:23,266
and Mikki didn't ask if
you could come along,

94
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:24,386
so I think she's lookin' forward to

95
00:07:24,386 --> 00:07:26,887
a few days away from you.

96
00:07:26,887 --> 00:07:28,498
Well, that's between you and her, Jeff.

97
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:29,831
I gotta go, bye.

98
00:07:30,756 --> 00:07:33,756
(soft guitar music)

99
00:07:38,138 --> 00:07:41,978
♫ It didn't happen to us overnight

100
00:07:41,978 --> 00:07:45,786
♫ You took the car and I went on in spite

101
00:07:45,786 --> 00:07:49,466
♫ I read the letter that you sent to me

102
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:52,578
♫ It said that certain
things weren't meant to be

103
00:07:52,578 --> 00:07:54,578
♫ To be

104
00:07:57,258 --> 00:08:01,116
♫ When I returned from my heart's jet lag

105
00:08:01,116 --> 00:08:04,927
♫ I put your pictures in a plastic bag

106
00:08:04,927 --> 00:08:08,698
♫ I put your address,
but for some good names

107
00:08:08,698 --> 00:08:11,686
♫ Sat back and watched
the thing go up in flames

108
00:08:11,686 --> 00:08:14,019
♫ In flames

109
00:08:16,175 --> 00:08:20,186
♫ Take a bunch of memories
that you've gone somewhere

110
00:08:20,186 --> 00:08:23,858
♫ Throw away that caution
to the cold night air

111
00:08:23,858 --> 00:08:25,615
♫ Scatter 'em to the stars above

112
00:08:25,615 --> 00:08:27,250
♫ 'Cause I don't care

113
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,083
♫ The reasons why

114
00:08:31,658 --> 00:08:35,825
♫ In the moonlight from a night gone by

115
00:08:40,655 --> 00:08:42,164
- [Nathan] Hey Karen, isn't
this the first time you've

116
00:08:42,164 --> 00:08:44,284
been out doing anything
since the accident?

117
00:08:44,284 --> 00:08:45,634
- [Karen] Yeah, and it feels awesome.

118
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:48,399
I'm so glad to be out of that damn house.

119
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,916
Hey, you guys are gonna
love my uncle's place,

120
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,535
the lake is really pretty.

121
00:08:51,535 --> 00:08:53,914
- [Mikki] I can't wait, this
is gonna be really nice.

122
00:08:53,914 --> 00:08:56,305
- [Karen] Mikki, does it bother you that

123
00:08:56,305 --> 00:08:58,095
Jeff isn't coming along?

124
00:08:58,095 --> 00:08:59,345
- [Mikki] No, you left it pretty much up

125
00:08:59,345 --> 00:09:01,204
to me if I wanted to bring someone else.

126
00:09:01,204 --> 00:09:02,636
It'll probably do me and Jeff some good

127
00:09:02,636 --> 00:09:04,604
to stay out of each
other's hair for a while.

128
00:09:04,604 --> 00:09:06,084
- [Nathan] Maybe after
some time to cool off,

129
00:09:06,084 --> 00:09:08,044
you two can work things out.

130
00:09:08,044 --> 00:09:10,844
I mean, how bad has it gotten?

131
00:09:10,844 --> 00:09:13,274
- [Mikki] Well, it's just
the same stupid stuff.

132
00:09:13,274 --> 00:09:16,265
Dumb arguments over nothing, I don't know.

133
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:18,394
He certainly can be a jerk sometimes.

134
00:09:18,394 --> 00:09:19,585
- [Karen] Don't think about it, Mikki.

135
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:21,996
Just enjoy the weekend.

136
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:23,274
- [Gary] Jeff, I certainly appreciate you

137
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:24,945
comin' down to help us out.

138
00:09:24,945 --> 00:09:26,465
- [Jeff] It's not a problem,
Karen's a good friend,

139
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,444
couldn't pass up her
invitation to come down.

140
00:09:28,444 --> 00:09:29,855
- [Gary] Yeah, she's quite a young lady.

141
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,259
- [Jeff] So your property
goes back pretty far, huh?

142
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:34,234
- [Gary] Yeah, it does,
the road behind the house

143
00:09:34,234 --> 00:09:36,780
there goes back to the
old farm, and that's where

144
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,571
the barn's at that I
need to get cleared out,

145
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:41,284
and then, back about another half mile or

146
00:09:41,284 --> 00:09:43,035
so back to the lake.

147
00:09:43,035 --> 00:09:45,236
- Really, what do you need
to clear out of the barn?

148
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:47,236
- Well, see, this was my dad's property,

149
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:49,883
and he passed away a
little over a year ago,

150
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:52,403
left all this to my wife Linda and myself,

151
00:09:52,403 --> 00:09:54,231
and the lake back there is great,

152
00:09:54,231 --> 00:09:56,466
we really like it, but my dad's work area

153
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:58,223
around the barn and
everything back there is

154
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:01,846
really junked up, actually,
he was quite a tinkerer,

155
00:10:01,846 --> 00:10:05,211
and he worked on, repaired,
and stored just about

156
00:10:05,211 --> 00:10:08,581
everything from old cars
to kitchen appliances.

157
00:10:08,581 --> 00:10:10,093
- Really, what was his job?

158
00:10:10,093 --> 00:10:12,075
- Well, it had nothin'
to do with his tinkering.

159
00:10:12,075 --> 00:10:14,990
Actually, he was a researcher
for various museums.

160
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,737
He researched and wrote
about Native Americans.

161
00:10:17,737 --> 00:10:20,242
He actually had a few things published.

162
00:10:20,242 --> 00:10:22,134
Along with this property,
I sort of inherited

163
00:10:22,134 --> 00:10:24,442
that fascination with
Native Americans myself,

164
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:26,810
I like to study their myths and legends,

165
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,134
just as a hobby.

166
00:10:28,134 --> 00:10:29,286
- That sounds cool.

167
00:10:29,286 --> 00:10:30,951
- Yeah, it is, it really is.

168
00:10:30,951 --> 00:10:33,714
Anyway, I sold that part
of the property back there.

169
00:10:33,714 --> 00:10:36,382
Around the barn, Dad's
work area, and all of

170
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:38,741
his junk included, but the thing is,

171
00:10:38,741 --> 00:10:41,314
I have some things back
there that are not junk

172
00:10:41,314 --> 00:10:43,089
that I need to get moved out and moved up

173
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:45,370
to my basement, that's
why I called Karen and

174
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,613
asked her to come down with some friends,

175
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:51,590
and it looks like the rest of
the crew is here right now.

176
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:54,423
(car approaching)

177
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:10,725
- Gary, hi!
- Hi.

178
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:13,644
- Hello, Jeff.

179
00:11:13,644 --> 00:11:15,311
- How you doin'?
- Better than ever.

180
00:11:15,311 --> 00:11:16,675
- Good, good.

181
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,475
Ready to get back to
those physics classes?

182
00:11:18,475 --> 00:11:20,427
- Better than sittin' at home.

183
00:11:20,427 --> 00:11:21,882
- Hey, Mark, how are you?
- Real good, Gary.

184
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:22,715
- Good.

185
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,537
- Uh, these are your
hardworking volunteers,

186
00:11:24,537 --> 00:11:26,959
that's Loretta and Nathan.
- Hi.

187
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,473
- Mikki.
- Hi.

188
00:11:28,473 --> 00:11:30,600
- And I see you've met Jeff.
- Yeah.

189
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,220
Well, it's a pleasure
meetin' all you guys,

190
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,197
I appreciate you comin' down, my wife was

191
00:11:34,197 --> 00:11:35,580
lookin' forward to meetin' you as well,

192
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,663
but she has a touch of the flu,

193
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:40,648
and she'll probably be
out and about tomorrow.

194
00:11:40,648 --> 00:11:42,235
In the meantime, you
guys just make yourself

195
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,524
at home and go set up
your tent down by the lake

196
00:11:44,524 --> 00:11:46,550
or whatever you like,
I don't really see any

197
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,188
need to get started until tomorrow.

198
00:11:48,188 --> 00:11:49,688
- Great. Oh, Jeff?

199
00:11:51,696 --> 00:11:54,196
May I please speak with you alone?

200
00:11:54,196 --> 00:11:56,956
- Um, I wanna talk to you,
I'll be right back, okay?

201
00:11:56,956 --> 00:11:57,789
- Okay.

202
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:01,144
- What the hell are you doin' here?

203
00:12:01,144 --> 00:12:02,580
Does my uncle think I invited you?

204
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,201
- Now, calm down, Karen, I just wanted to

205
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:05,034
come down and see if I could stay with

206
00:12:05,034 --> 00:12:06,397
you guys this weekend.

207
00:12:06,397 --> 00:12:07,465
- How'd you find your way here?

208
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:09,342
- Your mom gave me directions, now listen,

209
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:10,457
I've been thinkin' about this stuff with

210
00:12:10,457 --> 00:12:12,527
me and Mikki and all these dumbass fights,

211
00:12:12,527 --> 00:12:14,147
and well, I just kinda wanted to see if

212
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:16,202
I could patch things up and I figured this

213
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,197
would be a good weekend to do it.

214
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:19,533
Now, if you want me to leave, I will,

215
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:22,616
but I'd like you to give me a chance.

216
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,562
- Well, you're down here now.

217
00:12:25,562 --> 00:12:27,536
I'm not gonna make you leave.

218
00:12:27,536 --> 00:12:29,613
But no bullshit this weekend, okay, Jeff?

219
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:31,946
- You got it, thanks, Karen.

220
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,880
(funky rock music)

221
00:12:40,145 --> 00:12:42,617
You know, I'm really glad
I came down this weekend.

222
00:12:42,617 --> 00:12:46,132
And I'm really glad you
were willing to talk to me.

223
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,489
- I think we should talk more often.

224
00:12:48,489 --> 00:12:50,906
- You're right, you're right.

225
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:55,402
(soft indie rock)

226
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,253
I want you to know I meant it when I said

227
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,229
I was gonna try harder, I mean, I really

228
00:13:09,229 --> 00:13:11,562
want you to understand that.

229
00:13:12,817 --> 00:13:14,525
- I think an elaborate
romantic evening out

230
00:13:14,525 --> 00:13:16,640
next weekend could convince me.

231
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,273
- Lady, you got a deal.

232
00:13:19,273 --> 00:13:22,606
(pleasant guitar music)

233
00:14:12,156 --> 00:14:14,656
(eerie music)

234
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,370
- What all did Gary's dad do back here?

235
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,754
- Oh, a little bit of everything.

236
00:15:06,754 --> 00:15:07,587
Obviously.

237
00:16:21,464 --> 00:16:22,540
- Looks like we've got a pretty big

238
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,083
job ahead of us tomorrow.

239
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,783
- Oh, great, that's just
what I wanted to hear.

240
00:16:26,783 --> 00:16:30,577
- So, we gonna do any of
the usual camping stuff?

241
00:16:30,577 --> 00:16:32,523
Roast marshmallows, tell ghost stories?

242
00:16:32,523 --> 00:16:34,360
- Get rained on, get poison ivy,

243
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,943
get bit by a snake?

244
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,497
- Hey, guys, mind if I join you?

245
00:16:41,497 --> 00:16:44,212
- Not at all, have a seat.

246
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,028
- I was lookin' through some of my stuff

247
00:16:46,028 --> 00:16:49,503
at the house earlier, including this here,

248
00:16:49,503 --> 00:16:50,836
thought I'd come down and see if you guys

249
00:16:50,836 --> 00:16:52,411
might wanna check it out.

250
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,796
- Oh, is this about the Indians?

251
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:55,396
- Yeah, it is, actually.

252
00:16:55,396 --> 00:16:57,076
I've made researching the history of this

253
00:16:57,076 --> 00:16:59,256
area sort of a hobby, and there's some

254
00:16:59,256 --> 00:17:01,060
pretty strange stories about the Indians

255
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,744
that once lived here.

256
00:17:02,744 --> 00:17:06,026
I mean, you know, it's all
just myths and legends.

257
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,981
- Sounds cool to me.

258
00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:10,216
- This place has a fascinating past.

259
00:17:10,216 --> 00:17:11,926
In the late 1830s, there were a tribe of

260
00:17:11,926 --> 00:17:14,222
Cherokee that settled this land.

261
00:17:14,222 --> 00:17:15,220
They were part of the Trail of Tears

262
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,140
that passed through here.

263
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,643
Well, there was a small
group of 'em managed to

264
00:17:18,643 --> 00:17:21,115
break away and bury themselves
deep enough into the

265
00:17:21,115 --> 00:17:24,340
hills that they weren't
discovered by the military.

266
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,446
And their primary religious
leader was their medicine man.

267
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,531
He was responsible for
the overall spiritual

268
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:31,255
well-being of the group.

269
00:17:31,255 --> 00:17:33,175
There were other religious
medical members of

270
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:35,863
the community that were
below the medicine man.

271
00:17:35,863 --> 00:17:39,280
They were called atigua,
like elders of the tribe.

272
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,067
They say it was an
elder who told the tribe

273
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:45,103
that the white man was good,
and that he could be trusted.

274
00:17:45,103 --> 00:17:48,626
Because of this elder, the
tribe did trust the white man.

275
00:17:48,626 --> 00:17:52,423
For their trust, they ended
up on the Trail of Tears.

276
00:17:52,423 --> 00:17:54,916
The elder felt extreme guilt.

277
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:59,179
He was taken blame for what
was happening to his tribe.

278
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:01,235
It was a nightmare.

279
00:18:01,235 --> 00:18:03,663
Many, many Indians died on the way,

280
00:18:03,663 --> 00:18:05,195
and the military would only let them bury

281
00:18:05,195 --> 00:18:07,819
their dead once every three days.

282
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:09,733
Boys were carryin' their dead sisters

283
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:11,245
and men were sleepin' at night with

284
00:18:11,245 --> 00:18:14,590
their dead wives lyin' next to them.

285
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:18,159
But, through all of this,
the Indians never cried.

286
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:21,054
And the people who saw this
happening to the Indians,

287
00:18:21,054 --> 00:18:24,795
the people who knew it
was wrong, they cried.

288
00:18:24,795 --> 00:18:28,270
Giving the Trail of Tears its name.

289
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:31,265
The Indians were a
very, very proud people.

290
00:18:31,265 --> 00:18:32,922
It's easy to see why the elder who had

291
00:18:32,922 --> 00:18:36,026
believed in the white man felt so ashamed.

292
00:18:36,026 --> 00:18:37,782
It was this elder who later instigated the

293
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:40,510
tribe's escape from the Trail of Tears.

294
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,210
He was trying to make up for his mistakes.

295
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,250
He wanted desperately
to lead the tribe from

296
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,218
the pain he thought he was causing them.

297
00:18:48,218 --> 00:18:49,990
Well, the tribe did settle in these hills,

298
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,194
and the elder continued searching for ways

299
00:18:52,194 --> 00:18:54,234
to help his people.

300
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:57,901
Until he stepped into
a world of dark magic.

301
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:01,464
See, it seems the elder saw a vision.

302
00:19:01,464 --> 00:19:04,314
A vision of a spirit called Retlawkoob.

303
00:19:04,314 --> 00:19:06,939
He was an evil spirit, a devil.

304
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:10,406
A devil the tribe thought
was made up of human souls.

305
00:19:10,406 --> 00:19:12,385
Souls of people that were bad.

306
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,442
I guess you could sort
of equate the Cherokee's

307
00:19:14,442 --> 00:19:17,730
belief in Retlawkoob to the
Christian's belief in Hell.

308
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,254
'Cause they believed
that if you were an evil

309
00:19:19,254 --> 00:19:21,850
person when you were
alive, that when you died,

310
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:24,574
that your soul would become
a part of Retlawkoob.

311
00:19:24,574 --> 00:19:27,042
The elder got caught up in the dark magic.

312
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,845
He began neglecting his
duties to the tribe.

313
00:19:29,845 --> 00:19:31,602
Soon the elder's life revolved around his

314
00:19:31,602 --> 00:19:34,164
communication with Retlawkoob.

315
00:19:34,164 --> 00:19:35,486
But soon it was time for the tribe to

316
00:19:35,486 --> 00:19:37,379
harvest their crops, crops that should get

317
00:19:37,379 --> 00:19:39,278
them through the winter and on through to

318
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,597
the following harvest.

319
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:45,107
Well, late one night, the
elder went off into the hills.

320
00:19:45,107 --> 00:19:47,342
He didn't come back until dawn.

321
00:19:47,342 --> 00:19:49,338
When he came back, just
as the rest of the tribe

322
00:19:49,338 --> 00:19:51,574
was getting up, they
were all standing there

323
00:19:51,574 --> 00:19:54,287
just totally shocked,
shocked to see that their

324
00:19:54,287 --> 00:19:57,928
crops had been turned into rows of stone.

325
00:19:57,928 --> 00:19:59,928
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.

326
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,914
- All their corn, their tobacco,

327
00:20:03,914 --> 00:20:06,222
their sunflowers, everything,

328
00:20:06,222 --> 00:20:08,555
just rows and rows of rocks.

329
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:15,193
Supposedly, these rocks
are from the cursed

330
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:17,213
fields of those Cherokee Indians.

331
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:18,474
- No way.

332
00:20:18,474 --> 00:20:21,920
Sorry, Gary, but that's
a little out there.

333
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,331
- What are those markings on the rocks?

334
00:20:25,331 --> 00:20:27,770
- According to legend,
the elder had gained

335
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,628
communication with a variety of demons.

336
00:20:30,628 --> 00:20:32,234
There were about 40 of
'em that he kept track

337
00:20:32,234 --> 00:20:34,649
of and wrote about.

338
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:37,634
He assigned a symbol to each demon,

339
00:20:37,634 --> 00:20:40,078
and all of the stones
that were found out in

340
00:20:40,078 --> 00:20:43,574
the cursed fields had one
of the 40 symbols on 'em.

341
00:20:43,574 --> 00:20:45,538
Now, the tribe was placed
in a lot of danger,

342
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:48,646
I mean, they could've all
starved without their harvest.

343
00:20:48,646 --> 00:20:51,348
And for such a serious
crime, the tribe decided

344
00:20:51,348 --> 00:20:53,686
that the elder should be killed,

345
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:55,966
and they threw him into
a hole in the ground.

346
00:20:55,966 --> 00:20:58,126
It's like a natural well.

347
00:20:58,126 --> 00:20:59,566
It's like a hole in the ground that's

348
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:01,394
sort of like a cave that's spring-fed

349
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:04,783
from the bottom, so it's
always full of water.

350
00:21:04,783 --> 00:21:07,219
As a matter of fact,
it's exactly that sort of

351
00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:09,374
spring-fed hole in the ground that feeds

352
00:21:09,374 --> 00:21:11,124
this lake right here.

353
00:21:12,058 --> 00:21:13,469
Now, I can't tell you for sure how these

354
00:21:13,469 --> 00:21:15,734
rocks got these symbols on 'em.

355
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:20,478
Maybe I did uncover some of
the elder's old magic tricks.

356
00:21:20,478 --> 00:21:21,636
But whether or not you believe that they

357
00:21:21,636 --> 00:21:23,676
just materialized out of thin air sort of

358
00:21:23,676 --> 00:21:27,156
depends on how many
bridges you've been sold.

359
00:21:27,156 --> 00:21:29,124
However, I have checked around,

360
00:21:29,124 --> 00:21:31,894
and this is the only lake in the area

361
00:21:31,894 --> 00:21:34,956
that's spring-fed from
the bottom, like that was.

362
00:21:34,956 --> 00:21:37,764
So, if they did actually
kill their elder and

363
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:40,176
throw him in a hole like
that, this very well

364
00:21:40,176 --> 00:21:42,908
may be where they dumped
the son of a bitch.

365
00:21:42,908 --> 00:21:44,408
They threw him in the hole, and then they

366
00:21:44,408 --> 00:21:47,108
gathered up all the stones
from the dead fields,

367
00:21:47,108 --> 00:21:49,401
and they threw them in the hole as well.

368
00:21:49,401 --> 00:21:50,748
This was all part of the ceremony that the

369
00:21:50,748 --> 00:21:53,388
medicine man was performing
to keep the elder's

370
00:21:53,388 --> 00:21:56,257
unclean spirit from rising up.

371
00:21:56,257 --> 00:21:58,384
The medicine man essentially
imprisoned the elder's

372
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:00,544
soul within the earth.

373
00:22:00,544 --> 00:22:02,132
They figured that if this elder was in

374
00:22:02,132 --> 00:22:04,984
communication with
Retlawkoob, then the elder's

375
00:22:04,984 --> 00:22:07,144
soul may actually be spared from becoming

376
00:22:07,144 --> 00:22:09,648
a part of Retlawkoob, and they were afraid

377
00:22:09,648 --> 00:22:11,568
that if this happened, that the elder's

378
00:22:11,568 --> 00:22:15,800
soul may come back and cause
trouble within the tribe.

379
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,732
Well, the tribe left the
area, considering the

380
00:22:17,732 --> 00:22:20,720
land to be cursed and unclean,

381
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,584
but most of them starved within months.

382
00:22:23,584 --> 00:22:25,862
Apparently, after the
tribe deserted this land,

383
00:22:25,862 --> 00:22:27,736
there was an earthquake, and an explosion

384
00:22:27,736 --> 00:22:30,680
from the natural well where
the elder had been thrown.

385
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,643
Spring water and hundreds
of stones marked with

386
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:35,597
the elder's demon symbols
were blown into the air,

387
00:22:35,597 --> 00:22:38,748
which would explain how
I have these rocks here.

388
00:22:38,748 --> 00:22:42,528
I found these after this
summer's flood waters went down,

389
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,420
and there may be a lot
more right under our feet

390
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,060
that just haven't been washed up yet.

391
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,024
Anyway, according to the translation of

392
00:22:49,024 --> 00:22:51,317
this elder's writings, these rocks are now

393
00:22:51,317 --> 00:22:53,808
passageways for the demons that the elder

394
00:22:53,808 --> 00:22:55,908
was in communication with.

395
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:59,648
Passageways for the demons
to possess living humans.

396
00:22:59,648 --> 00:23:02,372
A demon supposedly enters
your body when you make

397
00:23:02,372 --> 00:23:05,163
physical contact with one of the rocks.

398
00:23:05,163 --> 00:23:07,908
The demon whose symbol is on that rock

399
00:23:07,908 --> 00:23:10,292
is the one that possesses you.

400
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:12,228
This land is supposedly just teeming with

401
00:23:12,228 --> 00:23:14,792
these demons, but they're all asleep,

402
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:19,100
and when they're asleep,
they don't possess you.

403
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,500
- Well, what if they wake up?

404
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,432
- They can't; according to the legend,

405
00:23:23,432 --> 00:23:25,068
they'll only awaken if a descendant of the

406
00:23:25,068 --> 00:23:28,023
Cherokee elder that went
bad steps onto the land.

407
00:23:28,023 --> 00:23:30,963
And none of you look Cherokee,
so I think we're safe.

408
00:23:30,963 --> 00:23:33,482
But apparently, that's the
whole core of the legend.

409
00:23:33,482 --> 00:23:35,808
If a descendant of the
elder comes onto the land,

410
00:23:35,808 --> 00:23:38,044
a lot of things are supposed to happen.

411
00:23:38,044 --> 00:23:40,172
The demons wake up, the demons are able to

412
00:23:40,172 --> 00:23:43,282
possess a living person
through physical contact,

413
00:23:43,282 --> 00:23:45,503
and invisible barriers
will supposedly form

414
00:23:45,503 --> 00:23:49,670
around this land, created by
ripples in time and space.

415
00:23:50,668 --> 00:23:52,740
I don't know if the
barriers are to contain the

416
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,696
active demons or to contain
the demon's victims,

417
00:23:56,696 --> 00:23:59,520
but the only two ways the
barriers can come down

418
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,744
are when there are no more
living humans in the land,

419
00:24:02,744 --> 00:24:05,683
in which case the demons go back to sleep,

420
00:24:05,683 --> 00:24:08,908
or if Retlawkoob is conjured
up into physical form

421
00:24:08,908 --> 00:24:11,580
and his heart is removed from his chest

422
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,204
and pushed into the barrier.

423
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:15,780
According to his writings, the elder had

424
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,628
the power to keep Retlawkoob
alive in a physical

425
00:24:18,628 --> 00:24:21,943
state if Retlawkoob was conjured up.

426
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:25,483
- So, how do you conjure this Retlawkoob?

427
00:24:25,483 --> 00:24:28,827
- Again, the descendant of
the Cherokee elder is the key.

428
00:24:28,827 --> 00:24:32,693
Only a descendant can conjure him up.

429
00:24:32,693 --> 00:24:35,267
Well, I've gone on long enough, guys.

430
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:36,405
I'm gonna have to get back to the house

431
00:24:36,405 --> 00:24:38,572
and see how Linda's doin'.

432
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,191
- [Jeff] Now, when an
Indian scalps somebody,

433
00:24:42,191 --> 00:24:43,692
does the scalp come right off, or do they

434
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:45,191
gotta sort of yank on it
to get it to peel off?

435
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:46,540
- [Karen] Jeff, would you shut up?

436
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,144
- [Mark] Hey Jeff, I think
there's still room for

437
00:24:48,144 --> 00:24:49,901
you at the bottom of that lake.

438
00:24:49,901 --> 00:24:51,919
Mikki and Jeff seem to
be doin' pretty good.

439
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,254
Mikki actually seems content.

440
00:24:54,254 --> 00:24:56,050
- I don't think it'll last.

441
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:58,479
They're too different.

442
00:24:58,479 --> 00:25:01,039
- Yeah, they're a strange couple.

443
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,759
- Jeff's just not right for her.

444
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:05,176
He's such a dick.

445
00:25:06,835 --> 00:25:08,967
Mikki doesn't know it,

446
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:11,595
but Jeff slept with someone else.

447
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:12,579
- Really?

448
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:15,983
- He slept with Mikki's older sister.

449
00:25:15,983 --> 00:25:17,650
- Her sister, Diana?

450
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,919
And Mikki doesn't know?

451
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,292
- [Karen] Well, I think Diana
was either really embarrassed,

452
00:25:23,292 --> 00:25:27,995
or she thought she was helping
Mikki by keeping it quiet.

453
00:25:27,995 --> 00:25:29,915
- [Mark] How'd you find out about it?

454
00:25:29,915 --> 00:25:31,763
- [Karen] Diana told me.

455
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:34,179
She was dying to confess to someone.

456
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:36,937
She feels really guilty.

457
00:25:36,937 --> 00:25:38,631
- [Mark] Mikki needs to know about this.

458
00:25:38,631 --> 00:25:40,048
- [Karen] I know.

459
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:48,051
(insects chirping)

460
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:49,687
- Where's Loretta?

461
00:25:49,687 --> 00:25:51,470
- I don't know, she wasn't with us.

462
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,435
- Hey, Loretta's not in the house,

463
00:25:53,435 --> 00:25:55,759
and neither is Gary.

464
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:57,815
And neither is his wife.

465
00:25:57,815 --> 00:25:59,839
- Well, the cars are still here.

466
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:01,579
They wouldn't have all gone
for a walk, would they?

467
00:26:01,579 --> 00:26:04,267
- Not Linda, she's
supposed to be sick in bed.

468
00:26:04,267 --> 00:26:05,707
- Yeah, this is weird.

469
00:26:05,707 --> 00:26:07,699
- Look, I don't like this.

470
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,363
Something's wrong.

471
00:26:09,363 --> 00:26:11,299
We should all go look for 'em.

472
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:13,480
- Look, the last I saw of Gary and Loretta

473
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,601
was when they went in the direction of

474
00:26:14,601 --> 00:26:16,041
that junkyard and the lake.

475
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,209
- We just came from near the lake,

476
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:18,621
no one was there, and we went through

477
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:20,193
the junkyard, and we didn't see 'em.

478
00:26:20,193 --> 00:26:21,589
- You could've missed 'em.

479
00:26:21,589 --> 00:26:22,984
- I guess we could've.

480
00:26:22,984 --> 00:26:25,293
They might be out lookin' around the barn.

481
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:28,429
- They're probably fine, but
I'll go get 'em just in case.

482
00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:30,109
- I'm gonna go, too.

483
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:32,609
(eerie music)

484
00:26:36,449 --> 00:26:40,116
(suspenseful musical sting)

485
00:26:54,968 --> 00:26:55,801
- Loretta?

486
00:28:16,451 --> 00:28:18,900
- Shit!
- What, what is it?

487
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,483
- Didn't you see it?
- See what?

488
00:28:22,927 --> 00:28:23,760
What?

489
00:28:26,224 --> 00:28:27,057
- Shit.

490
00:28:28,739 --> 00:28:31,239
(eerie music)

491
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,073
Oh shit.

492
00:29:09,463 --> 00:29:12,130
(musical sting)

493
00:29:14,722 --> 00:29:18,889
(suspenseful music)
(screaming)

494
00:29:32,007 --> 00:29:34,757
(demon groaning)

495
00:29:57,568 --> 00:30:00,103
- It's Gary, he attacked us.
- Bullshit.

496
00:30:00,103 --> 00:30:01,560
- No, it was Gary.

497
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,044
I don't know what the
hell's goin' on, Karen,

498
00:30:03,044 --> 00:30:04,723
but we've got to get out of here.

499
00:30:04,723 --> 00:30:05,968
- We can't leave Loretta!

500
00:30:05,968 --> 00:30:07,492
- Loretta could've already gone for help!

501
00:30:07,492 --> 00:30:08,572
- You don't know that!

502
00:30:08,572 --> 00:30:10,708
- Look, Nathan, if Loretta
was attacked by Gary,

503
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,388
she would've ran off into
the woods or something,

504
00:30:12,388 --> 00:30:13,992
she wouldn't have stopped
to think about it!

505
00:30:13,992 --> 00:30:15,408
- But if she didn't run off, I mean,

506
00:30:15,408 --> 00:30:16,842
I just can't leave her here!

507
00:30:16,842 --> 00:30:20,695
- Nathan, if she's back there, she's dead.

508
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:22,431
- Fuck you!

509
00:30:22,431 --> 00:30:23,264
Fuck you!

510
00:30:23,264 --> 00:30:25,131
- Nathan, calm down and shut the hell up!

511
00:30:25,131 --> 00:30:27,034
- Karen, she's our friend!

512
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,414
- How can you act like this?

513
00:30:28,414 --> 00:30:30,663
- Fuck it, I'll go back there
with him and look for her.

514
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:32,683
- Okay, w-we'll go inside

515
00:30:32,683 --> 00:30:33,909
and call for help.

516
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:34,909
- All right.

517
00:30:36,618 --> 00:30:37,864
- Shit.
- What, what's wrong?

518
00:30:37,864 --> 00:30:39,033
- [Karen] The phone is still dead.

519
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:40,341
- [Jeff] Still dead, what
are you talkin' about?

520
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:41,699
- [Karen] There was a
storm a few days ago,

521
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:43,796
a tree hit my uncle's power lines.

522
00:30:43,796 --> 00:30:45,176
I guess they just haven't gotten out this

523
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,452
far yet to fix it.

524
00:30:46,452 --> 00:30:48,927
- Gotten out this far, how
many days ago was this storm?

525
00:30:48,927 --> 00:30:49,760
- Five or six.

526
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,652
- Five or six days, and they haven't

527
00:30:50,652 --> 00:30:52,259
gotten out this far yet?

528
00:30:52,259 --> 00:30:54,058
Jesus Christ, Karen, this
is Missouri farmland,

529
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:57,016
it's not some third world
country or somethin', is it?

530
00:30:57,016 --> 00:30:57,849
Well, is it?

531
00:30:57,849 --> 00:30:59,533
- I think the phones are
just dead here at the house,

532
00:30:59,533 --> 00:31:04,224
we can run up the road and
use a neighbor's phone.

533
00:31:04,224 --> 00:31:06,724
(eerie music)

534
00:31:13,385 --> 00:31:15,502
- What are you doing?

535
00:31:15,502 --> 00:31:18,305
Why didn't you come help me?

536
00:31:18,305 --> 00:31:19,388
What's wrong?

537
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:22,495
- Karen, you...

538
00:31:25,935 --> 00:31:28,518
You were running with us, well,

539
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,760
ahead of us, and then...

540
00:31:34,506 --> 00:31:36,839
Then all of a sudden, you...

541
00:31:38,538 --> 00:31:40,354
You were facing us.

542
00:31:40,354 --> 00:31:41,944
- No.

543
00:31:41,944 --> 00:31:44,510
I must've been in there five minutes.

544
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,343
I don't...

545
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,678
It's a barrier.

546
00:31:48,678 --> 00:31:52,233
From the stories that Gary told us.

547
00:31:52,233 --> 00:31:53,558
It's up.

548
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:55,862
- No, i-it, no, it can't, no...

549
00:31:55,862 --> 00:31:58,279
- I know, it, it doesn't fit.

550
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:01,953
- Are we trapped?

551
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:03,754
- No, no, no, no.

552
00:32:03,754 --> 00:32:05,913
Listen, none of us are descended of some

553
00:32:05,913 --> 00:32:08,027
fuckin' Indian elder, we didn't wake up

554
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:09,998
a bunch of fuckin' demons,
and we're certainly

555
00:32:09,998 --> 00:32:13,787
not trapped here by a bunch
of fuckin' invisible barriers!

556
00:32:13,787 --> 00:32:14,733
- Jeff?

557
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,818
- Karen, look, there's
absolutely nothing...

558
00:32:16,818 --> 00:32:19,651
(loud screeching)

559
00:32:58,947 --> 00:33:01,738
(coughing)
- That was real smart, Jeff.

560
00:33:01,738 --> 00:33:04,423
- No, that wasn't smart at all.

561
00:33:04,423 --> 00:33:06,923
(eerie music)

562
00:33:08,863 --> 00:33:09,696
- Nathan.

563
00:33:12,207 --> 00:33:13,290
- Oh, my God.

564
00:33:22,473 --> 00:33:23,306
Loretta?

565
00:33:24,894 --> 00:33:28,118
Loretta!
(Loretta moans)

566
00:33:28,118 --> 00:33:30,035
Thank God you're alive.

567
00:33:31,949 --> 00:33:34,431
- [Mark] What is this?

568
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:36,157
- I don't know.

569
00:33:36,157 --> 00:33:37,942
- [Mark] Let's get her down.

570
00:33:37,942 --> 00:33:39,714
- You're gonna be okay.

571
00:33:39,714 --> 00:33:41,602
You're gonna be all right.

572
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:45,435
- Nathan!
(loud musical sting)

573
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,920
(demon grunting)

574
00:34:16,851 --> 00:34:19,601
(Mark screaming)

575
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:25,949
(eerie music)

576
00:34:44,641 --> 00:34:47,308
(flesh ripping)

577
00:35:02,031 --> 00:35:03,967
- What's that, up there, you see that?

578
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:05,379
- Yeah.

579
00:35:05,379 --> 00:35:07,027
Mark?

580
00:35:07,027 --> 00:35:07,860
Nathan?

581
00:35:10,779 --> 00:35:12,029
- It's just me.

582
00:35:13,087 --> 00:35:13,920
Nathan...

583
00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:22,612
Gary bit Nathan.

584
00:35:25,655 --> 00:35:27,655
Gary isn't Gary anymore.

585
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:35,298
I think it's from him
touching one of those rocks.

586
00:35:37,454 --> 00:35:40,387
Loretta was back there, too.

587
00:35:40,387 --> 00:35:41,220
Alive.

588
00:35:42,999 --> 00:35:45,699
But she's hung up by this

589
00:35:45,699 --> 00:35:47,699
secretion-looking stuff.

590
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:51,307
I think Gary bit her, too.

591
00:35:51,307 --> 00:35:53,739
- Oh no, this is ridiculous,
this isn't happening...

592
00:35:53,739 --> 00:35:55,611
- Look, the quicker we
accept what's going on,

593
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:58,087
the quicker we can find a solution.

594
00:35:58,087 --> 00:35:59,287
Gary's got a lot of information on

595
00:35:59,287 --> 00:36:01,251
this stuff back at the house.

596
00:36:01,251 --> 00:36:03,982
I'm sure we could figure
a way out of this.

597
00:36:03,982 --> 00:36:05,676
But first, I think we should go back for

598
00:36:05,676 --> 00:36:07,259
Nathan and Loretta.

599
00:36:27,209 --> 00:36:28,959
- Oh, my God.
- Linda?

600
00:36:42,928 --> 00:36:45,678
(metal crashing)

601
00:36:55,785 --> 00:36:58,593
- Come on, you shit, come on!

602
00:36:58,593 --> 00:37:02,760
(flashlight thumping)
(suspenseful music)

603
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:09,291
(demon grunting)

604
00:37:12,121 --> 00:37:14,288
Karen, get out of the way!

605
00:37:18,009 --> 00:37:20,926
(flesh squelching)

606
00:37:22,885 --> 00:37:24,520
- You okay?

607
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,520
- Yeah, you?

608
00:37:27,607 --> 00:37:28,440
- Yeah.

609
00:37:29,905 --> 00:37:32,238
- Let's go get Loretta down.

610
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:46,660
Okay, let's get her out of this crap.

611
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,493
(Loretta moaning)

612
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:52,988
- Was Loretta hung up there a long time

613
00:37:52,988 --> 00:37:55,104
before Gary got Nathan?

614
00:37:55,104 --> 00:37:56,104
- Yeah, why?

615
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,340
- Could there be a
reason why Gary didn't...

616
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:03,216
Didn't finish the job on Loretta?

617
00:38:03,216 --> 00:38:05,883
Let's go, let's get out of here!

618
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:12,619
(demon growls)
(eerie music)

619
00:38:24,003 --> 00:38:26,753
(demon groaning)

620
00:38:50,045 --> 00:38:52,212
- Okay, tell us what's up.

621
00:38:53,537 --> 00:38:57,339
- Well, to kill them, we've
gotta get them in the heart.

622
00:38:57,339 --> 00:39:00,620
Destroy the heart, make it stop beating.

623
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,002
There's also somethin' here about the

624
00:39:02,002 --> 00:39:03,891
medicine man of the tribe.

625
00:39:03,891 --> 00:39:05,902
His last words before he
died became something of

626
00:39:05,902 --> 00:39:08,356
a common phrase, like a motto or somethin'

627
00:39:08,356 --> 00:39:10,273
to the remaining tribe.

628
00:39:11,658 --> 00:39:14,839
Uh, the translation of
his dying words reads,

629
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:17,435
"Forever beware his deceiving nature.

630
00:39:17,435 --> 00:39:19,503
"Petals of the rose can be masks that

631
00:39:19,503 --> 00:39:21,170
"hide an evil soul."

632
00:39:22,459 --> 00:39:24,467
Obviously, this was in
reference to an elder,

633
00:39:24,467 --> 00:39:27,634
a trusted religious leader turned bad.

634
00:39:29,476 --> 00:39:32,309
I guess they felt pretty betrayed.

635
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:35,207
Check this out, Gary made sketches of

636
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:38,763
all the symbols that were on the rocks.

637
00:39:38,763 --> 00:39:41,430
There's a spider and a scorpion.

638
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:43,736
A bobcat, a boar.

639
00:39:47,062 --> 00:39:47,895
A snake.

640
00:39:49,552 --> 00:39:50,385
Wolf.

641
00:39:52,254 --> 00:39:53,087
A vulture.

642
00:39:55,381 --> 00:39:57,721
Here's the creepiest one.

643
00:39:57,721 --> 00:39:59,138
The demon of man.

644
00:40:00,721 --> 00:40:03,645
Gary wrote a lot about this one.

645
00:40:03,645 --> 00:40:06,421
Um, "if someone touches a rock with the

646
00:40:06,421 --> 00:40:08,789
"man demon symbol on it, they're possessed

647
00:40:08,789 --> 00:40:11,337
"by the most dangerous demon of all.

648
00:40:11,337 --> 00:40:12,913
"Someone possessed by the man demon won't

649
00:40:12,913 --> 00:40:16,496
"attack and kill like
an animal, it thinks.

650
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:21,329
"It will plan as many ways to have as much

651
00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:24,823
"control over as many other
human beings as possible."

652
00:40:24,823 --> 00:40:27,293
- Sounds like us, all right.

653
00:40:27,293 --> 00:40:29,789
At least none of Gary's rocks
had the man symbol on 'em.

654
00:40:29,789 --> 00:40:31,627
- Also, according to Gary's notes,

655
00:40:31,627 --> 00:40:34,885
a possession will come on like a sickness,

656
00:40:34,885 --> 00:40:37,314
not necessarily all at once.

657
00:40:37,314 --> 00:40:38,785
It says here that a demon that possesses

658
00:40:38,785 --> 00:40:42,445
a body must first devour
the body's original soul

659
00:40:42,445 --> 00:40:45,565
before it can have total
control over the body.

660
00:40:45,565 --> 00:40:49,525
So it's sort of a
gradual process, I guess.

661
00:40:49,525 --> 00:40:51,189
It says here that the
time it takes for a demon

662
00:40:51,189 --> 00:40:53,141
to take over a body
varies from one type of

663
00:40:53,141 --> 00:40:54,956
demon to the next.

664
00:40:54,956 --> 00:40:56,800
- Oh, well, that's just fuckin' great.

665
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,525
So that means any or all of us could've

666
00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:00,325
touched one of those rocks and we may not

667
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:02,980
remember it, or we may
not want to admit it.

668
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,557
- Okay, who touched a rock?

669
00:41:04,557 --> 00:41:05,978
- I didn't.
- I didn't.

670
00:41:05,978 --> 00:41:07,811
- Wait, wait a minute.

671
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:10,941
When Gary brought the rocks out,

672
00:41:10,941 --> 00:41:13,761
Karen, I remember, you picked one up.

673
00:41:13,761 --> 00:41:15,543
- No, no, Mikki, you're wrong,

674
00:41:15,543 --> 00:41:17,043
I never touched one, I'm positive.

675
00:41:17,043 --> 00:41:18,620
- What if she doesn't know yet?

676
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,359
Or what if she does know,
and she's lying about it?

677
00:41:20,359 --> 00:41:22,429
- Damn it, Mikki, I know
we're in a lot of danger,

678
00:41:22,429 --> 00:41:23,759
and I would not lie if I thought it would

679
00:41:23,759 --> 00:41:26,024
end up making things worse!

680
00:41:26,024 --> 00:41:27,206
And I know we've all changed,

681
00:41:27,206 --> 00:41:29,427
we're survivors and we're killers.

682
00:41:29,427 --> 00:41:32,172
If I am one of those things,
and I just don't know it yet,

683
00:41:32,172 --> 00:41:35,352
I'm very confident in
your ability to kill me.

684
00:41:35,352 --> 00:41:36,507
Now, we're much stronger as a group than

685
00:41:36,507 --> 00:41:39,086
we are by ourselves, so stop
breakin' up the team, Mikki!

686
00:41:39,086 --> 00:41:41,366
- There is no goddamn team
here, Karen, you think...

687
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:43,507
(Mikki and Karen argue)

688
00:41:43,507 --> 00:41:45,092
If you flip out on us,
you're gonna be like

689
00:41:45,092 --> 00:41:46,819
extra baggage, and we
can't afford to let you

690
00:41:46,819 --> 00:41:48,902
drag the rest of us down!

691
00:41:55,901 --> 00:41:56,734
- Damn it.

692
00:41:58,035 --> 00:41:59,368
I'm just scared.

693
00:42:00,676 --> 00:42:02,259
- We're all scared.

694
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,019
- You know, we still don't even know

695
00:42:06,019 --> 00:42:07,831
why this is happening.

696
00:42:07,831 --> 00:42:09,137
- You're right.

697
00:42:09,137 --> 00:42:10,847
It doesn't fit with the legends.

698
00:42:10,847 --> 00:42:12,497
An Indian descendant of the elder is

699
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:15,997
supposedly needed to trigger all this off.

700
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,802
- [Mark] Wait a minute.

701
00:42:19,802 --> 00:42:21,437
Karen?

702
00:42:21,437 --> 00:42:24,227
When you were in the
hospital after the accident,

703
00:42:24,227 --> 00:42:27,091
they gave you blood, didn't they?

704
00:42:27,091 --> 00:42:28,187
Donated blood?

705
00:42:28,187 --> 00:42:30,104
- Yeah, why, what do...

706
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:33,362
You don't think that...

707
00:42:33,362 --> 00:42:36,195
- What are you guys talkin' about?

708
00:42:37,711 --> 00:42:40,682
- What if the descendant
of that Indian sorcerer

709
00:42:40,682 --> 00:42:42,856
gave blood at some time, and that person's

710
00:42:42,856 --> 00:42:45,019
blood got into you?

711
00:42:45,019 --> 00:42:47,982
- That's a slim chance, but
it would explain things,

712
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,782
I mean, we can't think of any other reason

713
00:42:49,782 --> 00:42:52,659
why this would all be happening.

714
00:42:52,659 --> 00:42:55,750
So that would mean the demons
think I'm the descendant.

715
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,833
- God, this is so fucked.

716
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,505
- Wait a minute.

717
00:43:00,505 --> 00:43:03,922
We may have found a way out of this shit.

718
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:06,954
Okay, here.

719
00:43:06,954 --> 00:43:10,074
"The barriers can be
knocked down only two ways.

720
00:43:10,074 --> 00:43:12,279
"First, if there are no living
people left within them,

721
00:43:12,279 --> 00:43:13,525
"the barriers come down."

722
00:43:13,525 --> 00:43:15,639
- [Jeff] I don't like that one.

723
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:18,070
- "But the other way is
by conjuring Retlawkoob,

724
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:21,137
"when he's called to physical
form, he can be killed.

725
00:43:21,137 --> 00:43:22,833
"According to the legends,
Retlawkoob's heart is

726
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,505
"made of stone, if the
heart is then removed,

727
00:43:25,505 --> 00:43:27,725
"it can be carried into the barrier,

728
00:43:27,725 --> 00:43:30,482
"and this will make the
barriers disappear."

729
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:31,385
Then we're all free.

730
00:43:31,385 --> 00:43:33,524
- Oh, that's just great,
that sounds real simple,

731
00:43:33,524 --> 00:43:34,833
well, we better get started so I can get

732
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:36,145
home in time for breakfast.

733
00:43:36,145 --> 00:43:36,978
- Jeff, shut up!

734
00:43:36,978 --> 00:43:39,669
- [Mikki] So, how is this
Retlawkoob conjured up?

735
00:43:39,669 --> 00:43:41,049
- Well, if we're right about the demons

736
00:43:41,049 --> 00:43:45,499
mistaking me for the descendant,
I can conjure him up.

737
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:47,498
See, it says here that
if the blood is spilled

738
00:43:47,498 --> 00:43:50,289
from the descendant, in this case, me,

739
00:43:50,289 --> 00:43:52,045
onto one of the rocks, it will bring forth

740
00:43:52,045 --> 00:43:54,187
Retlawkoob in physical form.

741
00:43:54,187 --> 00:43:55,511
- [Mikki] Are the rocks here in the house?

742
00:43:55,511 --> 00:43:58,928
- Yeah, I think they're up in the closet.

743
00:44:14,255 --> 00:44:18,422
(demon growling)
(suspenseful music)

744
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:37,616
- (shouting) Keep going!

745
00:45:26,158 --> 00:45:28,908
(demon groaning)

746
00:45:39,471 --> 00:45:41,971
(eerie music)

747
00:45:51,462 --> 00:45:53,734
- We're gonna kill the thing.

748
00:45:53,734 --> 00:45:56,900
We're gonna do what
Gary's notes say to do.

749
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,224
We're gonna conjure Retlawkoob,

750
00:45:59,224 --> 00:46:00,128
we're gonna conjure him up,

751
00:46:00,128 --> 00:46:02,094
and we're gonna kill the son of a bitch.

752
00:46:02,094 --> 00:46:05,977
- Get his heart, and knock
the barriers down with it.

753
00:46:05,977 --> 00:46:07,227
- That's right.

754
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,565
- We're gonna make it.

755
00:46:11,787 --> 00:46:14,109
- We're gonna make it.

756
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:14,942
(suspenseful rock music)
Mikki!

757
00:46:14,942 --> 00:46:17,609
(demon roaring)

758
00:46:32,676 --> 00:46:34,843
(gunfire)

759
00:46:46,477 --> 00:46:48,310
- May I?
- Be my guest.

760
00:46:51,453 --> 00:46:54,370
(chainsaw revving)

761
00:47:20,582 --> 00:47:23,082
(eerie music)

762
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:22,077
(car engine rumbling)

763
00:49:24,507 --> 00:49:25,840
- Piece of junk.

764
00:49:45,455 --> 00:49:48,122
(demon moaning)

765
00:50:04,531 --> 00:50:07,364
(loud screeching)

766
00:50:44,008 --> 00:50:46,758
(demon growling)

767
00:50:52,393 --> 00:50:54,976
(car starting)

768
00:51:09,211 --> 00:51:10,831
- A trap.

769
00:51:10,831 --> 00:51:13,292
We'll make our trap...

770
00:51:13,292 --> 00:51:17,240
And then I'll cut myself
and get blood on the rocks.

771
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,327
- We're gonna kill it, take its heart,

772
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,994
and get out of here.

773
00:51:24,647 --> 00:51:27,390
(hammer banging)

774
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:30,473
(soft ambient music)

775
00:52:02,528 --> 00:52:05,494
(electricity popping)

776
00:52:05,494 --> 00:52:07,436
- Well, the hook is ready.

777
00:52:07,436 --> 00:52:09,744
Now we just need to stick a worm on it.

778
00:52:09,744 --> 00:52:11,380
- Where will I be hiding?

779
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:12,903
- Down there by the box.

780
00:52:12,903 --> 00:52:14,468
- Well, I'm gonna go down now and figure

781
00:52:14,468 --> 00:52:15,393
out a way to hide myself.

782
00:52:15,393 --> 00:52:17,324
- Okay, I'll make sure this thing's ready.

783
00:52:17,324 --> 00:52:18,324
- All right.

784
00:52:22,346 --> 00:52:25,009
(suspenseful music)

785
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:25,842
- Mikki!

786
00:52:36,701 --> 00:52:39,284
(demon groans)

787
00:52:52,865 --> 00:52:53,782
Shit, shit!

788
00:53:00,575 --> 00:53:03,408
(demonic moaning)

789
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,945
(Retlawkoob roars)

790
00:53:28,207 --> 00:53:29,207
Mikki, help!

791
00:53:30,455 --> 00:53:34,622
(electricity firing)
(Retlawkoob groaning)

792
00:54:00,791 --> 00:54:01,791
- Its heart.

793
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:04,270
We need its heart.

794
00:54:19,948 --> 00:54:22,448
(eerie music)

795
00:54:23,997 --> 00:54:28,164
(Retlawkoob roars)
(suspenseful music)

796
00:54:59,978 --> 00:55:02,645
(chewing flesh)

797
00:55:22,471 --> 00:55:25,554
(Retlawkoob roaring)

798
00:55:39,339 --> 00:55:42,089
(Karen shouting)

799
00:56:09,554 --> 00:56:12,304
(bones cracking)

800
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,752
(flesh tearing)

801
00:56:33,846 --> 00:56:36,346
(eerie music)

802
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:45,577
(chewing flesh)

803
00:57:39,192 --> 00:57:42,109
(chainsaw revving)

804
00:57:50,484 --> 00:57:53,484
(suspenseful music)

805
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:03,541
(skull cracking)

806
00:59:09,311 --> 00:59:11,020
- [Gary] The medicine man
essentially imprisoned

807
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:13,471
the elder's soul within the earth.

808
00:59:13,471 --> 00:59:16,428
- [Karen] Forever beware
his deceiving nature.

809
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:20,231
Petals of a rose can be
masked to hide an evil soul.

810
00:59:20,231 --> 00:59:21,199
- [Gary] According to his writings,

811
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:24,059
the elder had the power
to keep Retlawkoob alive

812
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:28,226
in a physical state if
Retlawkoob was conjured up.

813
00:59:48,701 --> 00:59:49,534
- Linda.

814
00:59:50,794 --> 00:59:52,534
You got the vulture demon.

815
00:59:52,534 --> 00:59:55,117
(demon growls)

816
01:00:15,838 --> 01:00:18,588
(twigs snapping)

817
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:26,161
(metal clanging)

818
01:00:33,859 --> 01:00:36,776
(Retlawkoob roars)

819
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:49,180
(Retlawkoob groans)

820
01:03:06,483 --> 01:03:09,233
(loud whooshing)

821
01:03:34,403 --> 01:03:36,203
- [Radio Announcer] A
shocking and bizarre event in

822
01:03:36,203 --> 01:03:38,382
Jefferson County last night,

823
01:03:38,382 --> 01:03:41,705
Linda Lidanico, age 39, brutally murdered

824
01:03:41,705 --> 01:03:44,302
and partially devoured six victims,

825
01:03:44,302 --> 01:03:47,093
including her husband, Gary Lidanico.

826
01:03:47,093 --> 01:03:49,134
The mass murder took
place on the Lidanico's

827
01:03:49,134 --> 01:03:51,502
property in Dittmer, Missouri.

828
01:03:51,502 --> 01:03:53,014
Authorities were told of the killings

829
01:03:53,014 --> 01:03:55,014
by Mikki Lomack, age 22.

830
01:03:55,873 --> 01:03:58,043
Lomack was with the
party that was murdered,

831
01:03:58,043 --> 01:03:59,854
but managed to escape.

832
01:03:59,854 --> 01:04:02,443
Authorities who arrived
to take Mrs. Lidanico into

833
01:04:02,443 --> 01:04:05,393
custody say that Lidanico was obviously in

834
01:04:05,393 --> 01:04:08,254
a state of deteriorated mental health.

835
01:04:08,254 --> 01:04:10,825
Lidanico is currently
being held at Harrison

836
01:04:10,825 --> 01:04:13,803
Mental Institution in St. Louis.

837
01:04:13,803 --> 01:04:15,102
- Trish, thanks for
lettin' me come out and

838
01:04:15,102 --> 01:04:17,803
look around again, it
was really nice of you.

839
01:04:17,803 --> 01:04:19,502
- It's not a problem at all.

840
01:04:19,502 --> 01:04:21,633
I was a bit surprised at
your interest in this,

841
01:04:21,633 --> 01:04:23,342
pleasantly surprised, of course.

842
01:04:23,342 --> 01:04:25,053
Just what made you change your mind?

843
01:04:25,053 --> 01:04:26,773
- Well, I guess it was
just a self confidence

844
01:04:26,773 --> 01:04:28,734
thing holding me back.

845
01:04:28,734 --> 01:04:30,454
I see it differently now.

846
01:04:30,454 --> 01:04:32,433
I see it as an opportunity,

847
01:04:32,433 --> 01:04:34,822
not something I'm just sure to fail at.

848
01:04:34,822 --> 01:04:36,513
- You certainly have changed.

849
01:04:36,513 --> 01:04:38,843
I think it is a miracle,
a miracle for you,

850
01:04:38,843 --> 01:04:40,273
the Church, and all the children who'll

851
01:04:40,273 --> 01:04:42,003
be at this camp next summer.

852
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:45,262
So thank you very much
for accepting this job.

853
01:04:45,262 --> 01:04:47,713
I'm eager to see what you're
gonna do at this camp.

854
01:04:47,713 --> 01:04:50,403
- Thank you for putting
up with my indecisiveness.

855
01:04:50,403 --> 01:04:52,273
You're a great friend, Trish.

856
01:04:52,273 --> 01:04:54,043
As a matter of fact, I'm starting to look

857
01:04:54,043 --> 01:04:56,502
forward to all the new challenges.

858
01:04:56,502 --> 01:04:57,983
And by the way, how many kids will

859
01:04:57,983 --> 01:04:59,563
be staying here next summer?

860
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:02,443
- Mmm, it's hard to
say, around 100, maybe.

861
01:05:02,443 --> 01:05:05,233
- Wow, that's a lot of responsibility.

862
01:05:05,233 --> 01:05:07,153
- Like I've said before,
Mikki, I have faith

863
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:08,945
in your abilities, and
so does everyone else

864
01:05:08,945 --> 01:05:12,203
at Imperial Baptist, and
if you do have some doubts,

865
01:05:12,203 --> 01:05:15,248
just pray, this is God's
will for you to do this,

866
01:05:15,248 --> 01:05:16,974
trust in him, and he's gonna guide you

867
01:05:16,974 --> 01:05:18,843
through all the hard times.

868
01:05:18,843 --> 01:05:20,235
You'll do great.

869
01:05:20,235 --> 01:05:22,694
I'm sure you'll do everything just right.

870
01:05:22,694 --> 01:05:24,974
- [Mikki] Yeah, I'm sure I will.

871
01:05:24,974 --> 01:05:27,974
(upbeat rock music)

872
01:08:55,229 --> 01:08:58,562
(pleasant guitar music)
