you know, um,

62
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,470
these things happen,
and you know when they say,

00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,606
"Oh, you did a great job,
but we didn't have

64
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,908
enough room in the budget,"

65
00:03:35,942 --> 00:03:38,678
they actually mean it.

66
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:40,412
No, what that means
is I'm not worth

67
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:43,015

- Oh, my God, Payton, no.

That is not what they mean.

I know you hate hearing this,

72
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,063
but I can take care of things...

73
00:03:57,096 --> 00:03:59,431
- Mm-mm, no.

I don't know if she'd be
too happy right now.

115

That depends on what you did.

00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:24,223
It's Payton, right?

188
00:09:24,256 --> 00:09:27,193
Yes, yes, ma'am.

189
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:30,396
I would like for you
to be my father's caretaker.

190
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:33,899
Oh, well, I'm... I'm not
a trained nurse, ma'am.

191
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:37,436
You don't need training
to clean up a little piss.

192
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:39,438
Well, I'm not a trained piss...

193
00:09:39,471 --> 00:09:42,975
pisser-cleaner-upper either.

194
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:45,144
For $5,000 a month?

195
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:51,417
My father really needs someone,

196
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,253
and it's clear that he has
taken a liking to you.

197
00:09:57,022 --> 00:09:59,124
Yeah, so this lady
comes down the stairs,

198
00:09:59,158 --> 00:10:00,392
and she's like, you know,
"Who are you?

199
00:10:00,426 --> 00:10:02,094
What are you doing here?"

200
00:10:02,127 --> 00:10:04,029
And I just told her,
"Hey, I just, you know...

201
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:06,198
I'm bringing him home,"
you know?

202
00:10:06,232 --> 00:10:08,000
A lady, who?

203
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:11,203
Well, it was his daughter,
turns out it was his daughter,

204
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:13,472
and I met with her
for a meeting,

205
00:10:13,505 --> 00:10:16,475
and she ended up
offering me a job

206
00:10:16,508 --> 00:10:19,511
to work for her father.

207
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:25,317
Kay, doing what?

208
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:27,119
Well, she wants me
to be like, uh...

209
00:10:27,152 --> 00:10:30,122
like... like caretaking almost,
basically, she said.

210
00:10:30,155 --> 00:10:31,924
You know, she said
they fired a bunch of nurses,

211
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:34,460
and they couldn't keep anybody,
and if I could keep him company

212
00:10:34,493 --> 00:10:36,829
and spend some time with him,
'cause he likes me.

213
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:38,897
So, you know,

214
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:40,833
I'm probably gonna take the job.

215
00:10:45,037 --> 00:10:46,972
What?

216
00:10:49,008 --> 00:10:50,809
I think that it is great

217
00:10:50,843 --> 00:10:53,012
that you have your own
opportunities, Payton,

218
00:10:53,045 --> 00:10:56,482
but this seems a little shady.

219
00:10:56,515 --> 00:10:58,050

220
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,419

Look, look, I know that
you don't wanna use

223
00:11:03,322 --> 00:11:07,559
but there are other
jobs out there.

224
00:11:07,593 --> 00:11:12,231
I'm not being offered
other jobs, Shannon.

225
00:11:12,264 --> 00:11:15,401
It's... it's a good opportunity,
and it's my money.

226
00:11:15,434 --> 00:11:17,002
It'll be my money.

227
00:11:18,638 --> 00:11:22,541
Okay, so you are
going to be a nurse now.

228
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,212

nobody's nurse.

to have a child,

00:17:53,465 --> 00:17:55,835
to go over
some blood work with you.

369
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:58,503
(ringing)

370
00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:00,873
(indistinct remarks)

371
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:06,344
...which seems fine,
and everything else

372
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:08,915
seems pretty normal.

373
00:18:08,948 --> 00:18:11,416
Yeah, good job, we, uh...

374
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,418
- I'll see you next week then.
- Mhm.

375
00:18:13,452 --> 00:18:15,454
- All right.
- Thank you.

376
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:17,289
See ya.

377
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:27,265
Hey.

378
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,601
- How'd it go?
- Good.

379
00:18:29,635 --> 00:18:31,403
(grunting)

380
00:18:31,436 --> 00:18:32,772
Let's go eat.

381
00:18:32,805 --> 00:18:34,606
- Yeah, all right.
- Yeah.

382
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:41,981
(grunting)

383
00:18:42,014 --> 00:18:45,550
The doctor didn't say anything
that you need to know, okay?

384
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:47,920
(coughing)

385
00:18:50,555 --> 00:18:52,725
- Damn it.
- That cough doesn't sound good.

386
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:54,861
(coughing)

387
00:18:54,894 --> 00:18:57,429
(grunting)

388
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,870
Hey, Gregory, if you're so rich,

389
00:19:03,903 --> 00:19:05,872
why do you eat
at this diner here?

390
00:19:05,905 --> 00:19:07,874
(clinking)

391
00:19:07,907 --> 00:19:09,909
Why do you always eat here?

392
00:19:11,677 --> 00:19:13,946
My grandmother.

393
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,982
She used to bring me here
after service.

394
00:19:16,015 --> 00:19:17,784
(clinking)

395
00:19:17,817 --> 00:19:20,753
Mm, she passed?

396
00:19:20,787 --> 00:19:23,022
Yeah, two years ago.

397
00:19:23,055 --> 00:19:25,357
(clinking)

398
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,059
- Mom, dad?
- No, I didn't know

399
00:19:27,093 --> 00:19:29,695
my father at all growing up,
he... he wasn't around.

400
00:19:31,664 --> 00:19:34,700
And, uh, my mother
died of breast cancer

401
00:19:34,734 --> 00:19:36,903
when I was 6.

402
00:19:41,107 --> 00:19:43,676
My grandmother,

403
00:19:43,709 --> 00:19:46,478
that's who raised me.

404
00:19:46,511 --> 00:19:49,115
That's who taught me,
you know, to be a man.

405
00:19:49,148 --> 00:19:51,383
She taught me to...

406
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,986
to do good.

407
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,824
Well, she sounds like
my kind of lady.

408
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,430
I spent, like, every last dime
I had burying her.

409
00:20:05,463 --> 00:20:08,734
It was, like,
all I could do for her.

410
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,774
Kind of been climbing out
of debt ever since.

411
00:20:14,807 --> 00:20:17,810
Well,

412
00:20:17,844 --> 00:20:21,647
I eat here
because the gravy is thick,

413
00:20:21,681 --> 00:20:25,918
and the waitresses
call you by your first name.

414
00:20:25,952 --> 00:20:27,653
That's where it's at.

415
00:20:29,554 --> 00:20:31,157
Took me 80 years to realize it,

416
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:35,094
but, that's where it's at.

417
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:39,464
(overlapping conversations)

418
00:20:43,836 --> 00:20:45,905
That's where it's at.

419
00:20:45,938 --> 00:20:48,473
(coughing)

420
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:53,578
Hey, drink some water,
drink some water.

421
00:20:53,612 --> 00:20:55,948

425
00:21:27,713 --> 00:21:29,215
- Hi.
- I'm keeping the baby.

426
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:38,157
(♪♪♪)

427
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,624
I've decided.

(♪♪♪)

429
00:21:41,526 --> 00:21:43,561
Jenetta.

430
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:46,198
You can't... you can't
decide that on your own.

431
00:21:46,232 --> 00:21:48,734
I have family, I can.

432
00:21:48,768 --> 00:21:50,937
And look, I'm not trying to
mess up anything you got going.

433
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,570
What the fuck
are you talking about?

434
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:54,707
First of all,
do not curse at me.

435
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,944
Second, I did not come here

436
00:21:57,977 --> 00:21:59,245
for your permission.

437
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:01,147
I just wanted to come
and let you know

438
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,182
what I have to say,

439
00:22:03,215 --> 00:22:06,085
and that I apologize
for our misunderstanding.

440
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:07,987
Okay, listen,
I respect you, Jenetta,

441
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,989
and I respect your body,
but do I not have a say

442
00:22:10,022 --> 00:22:12,557
- in any of this?
- Go ahead, you got a say.

443
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,227
(♪♪♪)

444
00:22:15,261 --> 00:22:18,864
Do you just expect me to,
you know,

445
00:22:18,898 --> 00:22:22,969
fucking throw
my whole life away right now

446
00:22:23,002 --> 00:22:25,938
because, you know,
you're deciding to have a baby?

447
00:22:25,972 --> 00:22:29,175
(♪♪♪)

448
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,643
I'm gonna go.

(♪♪♪)

450
00:22:33,245 --> 00:22:36,849
Look, Payton.

451
00:22:36,882 --> 00:22:39,517
If you wanna be
in this child's life,

452
00:22:39,551 --> 00:22:42,755
you have that right.

453
00:22:42,788 --> 00:22:45,091
But, we both know
what you're gonna do.

454
00:22:45,124 --> 00:22:47,860
So, here's your permission.

455
00:22:58,337 --> 00:23:00,806
(coughing)

456
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,175
(birds chirping)

457
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:08,080
Well, what's going on with you?

458
00:23:08,114 --> 00:23:11,884
Clearly there's
something going on.

459
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:16,188
I fucked up,
and I got my ex pregnant.

460
00:23:16,222 --> 00:23:17,723
Oh, here we go.

461
00:23:17,757 --> 00:23:19,859
And I don't know
what to do, man.

462
00:23:19,892 --> 00:23:22,061
You know, things are just
turning around for me, Gregory.

463
00:23:22,094 --> 00:23:24,196
If Shannon found out
about this now,

464
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:28,067
- we'd be done for good.
- Well, she's gonna find out

465
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,770
as soon as
that child support kicks in.

466
00:23:30,803 --> 00:23:32,604
Well, that's the one good thing
is that Jenetta,

467
00:23:32,638 --> 00:23:35,174
she's not tripping, but Shannon

468
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:36,876
is a whole other kind
of situation.

469
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:39,879
You're not gonna raise
your own child?

470
00:23:39,912 --> 00:23:41,613
I mean, Jenetta has...

471
00:23:41,647 --> 00:23:43,249
Now look, I'm not asking you
about fucking Jenetta.

472
00:23:43,282 --> 00:23:46,752
I'm asking you, are you gonna
abandon your own baby?

473
00:23:46,786 --> 00:23:48,854
Abandon my own baby?

474
00:23:48,888 --> 00:23:51,290
I... I mean, are you...?

475
00:23:51,323 --> 00:23:55,027
Are you telling me
that your own child

476
00:23:55,061 --> 00:23:57,630
is not as important
as some rich girl's pussy?

477
00:23:57,663 --> 00:23:59,965
- Don't talk about her like that.
- Oh, here we go again.

478
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:01,901
Another young Black man

479
00:24:01,934 --> 00:24:03,803
making babies he won't raise.

480
00:24:03,836 --> 00:24:05,237
- Fucking around.
- You don't know

481
00:24:05,271 --> 00:24:07,605
- what you're talking about.
- And won't own up,

482
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,241
- won't be a man.
- Fuck you!

483
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:10,810
Oh, fuck me? Fuck me?

00:26:53,872 --> 00:26:56,308
(♪♪♪)

551
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,879
(birds and insects chirping)

552
00:27:02,548 --> 00:27:04,483
Would you like to like
to be alone for this?

553
00:27:04,516 --> 00:27:07,286
Oh, no, no.

554
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:10,122
He can stay.

555
00:27:10,155 --> 00:27:13,959
Well, the test results
from the biopsy came back,

556
00:27:13,993 --> 00:27:17,162
and, uh, the cancer
has metastasized

557
00:27:17,196 --> 00:27:20,899
further than we anticipated.

558
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:23,202
You have maybe five months.

559
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,315
Thank you.

560
00:27:36,348 --> 00:27:39,351
I'm sorry,
I'll give you guys some time.

561
00:27:53,132 --> 00:27:55,334
Ms. Barbara.

562
00:27:55,367 --> 00:27:59,271
He's your father, I mean,
do you not wanna be there?

563
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:00,973
Do you not wanna
take some time off work?

564
00:28:01,006 --> 00:28:03,075
- I mean...
- Yes, I know he's my father,

565
00:28:03,108 --> 00:28:06,345
but I pay you to take care
of him so that I don't have to.

566
00:28:06,378 --> 00:28:08,080
Do you need more money, Payton?

567
00:28:08,113 --> 00:28:09,415
Because that's no problem.

568
00:28:09,448 --> 00:28:12,151
He's very fond of you, okay?

569
00:28:14,053 --> 00:28:17,222
He doesn't have a lot of time.

570
00:28:17,256 --> 00:28:19,558
So,

571
00:28:19,591 --> 00:28:23,295
that's why I'm asking you

572
00:28:23,329 --> 00:28:25,531
to stay onboard.

573
00:28:25,564 --> 00:28:28,600
(♪♪♪)

574
00:28:28,635 --> 00:28:31,537
Okay.

575
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,972
Ah, baby,
look at our little girl.

576
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:36,108
Oh, she's so beautiful.

577
00:28:36,141 --> 00:28:38,077
(chuckling)

578
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,646
(♪♪♪)

579
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,081
- Think you look great.
- Yeah, you do, too.

580
00:28:42,114 --> 00:28:44,883
You look beautiful.

581
00:28:44,917 --> 00:28:46,218
Get a little closer.

582
00:28:46,251 --> 00:28:49,421
- There ya go.
- I can't believe it.

583
00:28:49,455 --> 00:28:51,924
- She's...
- They look great to me.

584
00:28:51,957 --> 00:28:54,927
Uh, hey, let's get
Shannon's solos now, okay?

585
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,528
(♪♪♪)

586
00:28:56,562 --> 00:28:59,098
- Uh, okay.
- You guys look wonderful.

587
00:28:59,131 --> 00:29:00,966
Wonderful, okay.

588
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:02,901
Wait till he gets this.

589
00:29:02,935 --> 00:29:07,573
(♪♪♪)

590
00:29:07,606 --> 00:29:09,241
You guys look great.

591
00:29:09,274 --> 00:29:12,311
Oh, thank you,
she... she looks great.

592
00:29:12,344 --> 00:29:15,114
Mm, no.

593
00:29:15,147 --> 00:29:17,116
You clean up well.

594
00:29:17,149 --> 00:29:19,518
Oh, thank you, ma'am.

595
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:21,620
It's almost like he's proposing.

596
00:29:21,654 --> 00:29:24,156
- Yeah.
- That's pretty good.

597
00:29:24,189 --> 00:29:26,125
Yeah, those are great.

598
00:29:26,158 --> 00:29:29,629
- Yeah, let's do that.
- Yeah, you girls go ahead.

599
00:29:29,662 --> 00:29:31,463
We can get the dishes, right?

600
00:29:31,497 --> 00:29:33,265
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

601
00:29:33,298 --> 00:29:35,100
All right.

602
00:29:35,134 --> 00:29:37,603
(clearing throat)

603
00:29:37,637 --> 00:29:39,605
All right, all right.

604
00:29:42,074 --> 00:29:45,611
All right, I wash, you dry,
or how you wanna do this?

605
00:29:45,645 --> 00:29:48,113
- Or you pass 'em, I'll dump 'em.
- Okay.

606
00:29:48,147 --> 00:29:50,983
Sounds good.

607
00:29:51,016 --> 00:29:52,618
Let me tell you something,
Payton.

608
00:29:52,652 --> 00:29:56,221
Something that
you need to get used to.

609
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:58,957
You gotta do the dishes
while she's showing off

610
00:29:58,991 --> 00:30:01,527
the jewelry
that you bought her, okay?

611
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,429
- Just remember that.
- Well, I don't know

612
00:30:03,462 --> 00:30:05,063
if they're just
showing off jewelry back there.

613
00:30:05,097 --> 00:30:08,233
They're probably deciding
our fates, you know?

614
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:12,171
This is not some
stupid infatuation.

615
00:30:12,204 --> 00:30:14,973
I'm not childish enough
to throw my life away

616
00:30:15,007 --> 00:30:16,942
on something like that.

617
00:30:20,546 --> 00:30:22,381
Shannon.

618
00:30:26,185 --> 00:30:28,520
- I'm not saying that, but...
- But what?

619
00:30:28,554 --> 00:30:32,090
This is another
pet project of mine?

620
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:34,727
You don't think so?

621
00:30:34,761 --> 00:30:36,962
That is so classist of you.

622
00:30:39,732 --> 00:30:42,434
Some men rise above
their upbringing,

623
00:30:42,468 --> 00:30:44,771
and some don't,

624
00:30:44,804 --> 00:30:46,438
and he hasn't.

625
00:30:48,373 --> 00:30:51,243
What he's done,
he'll probably do it again.

626
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:57,449
Well, all I'm trying to say is...

627
00:30:57,483 --> 00:31:00,486
Oh, no, no,
we got this, we got this.

628
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:04,657
That regardless what
reservations I had about you,

629
00:31:04,691 --> 00:31:07,259
I'm glad you're
part of the family,

630
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:10,329
and if you guys
ever need anything,

631
00:31:10,362 --> 00:31:13,198
don't be afraid to ask.

632
00:31:13,232 --> 00:31:15,200
Well, I appreciate that,
I appreciate that very much.

633
00:31:15,234 --> 00:31:16,502
- Okay?
- And I want you to know that

634
00:31:16,535 --> 00:31:19,238
I'm, uh... I'm gonna
work very hard

635
00:31:19,271 --> 00:31:22,107
to give Shannon
the life she deserves.

636
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,710
Promise you that, how's that?

637
00:31:23,743 --> 00:31:26,178
Yeah, but we'll help.

638
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,389
The service was nice.

639
00:31:37,422 --> 00:31:39,091
Yeah, yeah.

640
00:31:39,124 --> 00:31:40,693
Yeah.

641
00:31:42,494 --> 00:31:44,329
(clanking)

642
00:31:47,266 --> 00:31:49,601
(clinking)

643
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:04,550
(clinking)

644
00:32:12,157 --> 00:32:14,794
You just gonna stand there,
or you gonna sit down and eat?

645
00:32:14,827 --> 00:32:17,229
(ticking)

646
00:32:17,262 --> 00:32:18,597
Good night, Dad.

647
00:32:18,631 --> 00:32:20,633
Oh, wait, wait!

648
00:32:22,835 --> 00:32:24,737
I'm gonna be dead by June.

649
00:32:26,471 --> 00:32:30,309
Can't you just sit down
and fucking eat with me?

650
00:32:44,824 --> 00:32:47,359
(clanking)

651
00:32:51,764 --> 00:32:54,299
(clanking)

652
00:33:14,721 --> 00:33:17,155
There's onions in this.

653
00:33:17,189 --> 00:33:19,391
- So what?
- I don't eat those.

654
00:33:21,526 --> 00:33:26,699
Well, I don't want you just
sitting there watching me eat.

655
00:33:26,733 --> 00:33:29,802
If you aren't gonna eat,
well why'd you sit down then?

656
00:33:29,836 --> 00:33:31,638
Because you told me to.

657
00:33:31,671 --> 00:33:34,506
You don't do what I...
you don't listen to me.

658
00:33:36,408 --> 00:33:39,277
Here I am a dying old man.

659
00:33:39,311 --> 00:33:41,480
You're barely
in my fucking life, I...

660
00:33:43,716 --> 00:33:45,317
Sometimes I...

661
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:49,521
I think you'd be happier
if I were gone for good.

662
00:33:49,554 --> 00:33:52,257
(clinking)

663
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,226
Now you want me
in your fucking life?

664
00:33:57,262 --> 00:34:00,198
All right.

665
00:34:00,232 --> 00:34:02,334
You have never
been there for me.

666
00:34:25,357 --> 00:34:26,826
(creaking)

667
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:28,861

668
00:34:28,895 --> 00:34:31,430
Mm, dinner was so good.

669
00:34:31,463 --> 00:34:34,366
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and, uh,

670
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,602
you look so good.

671
00:34:37,637 --> 00:34:39,538
- Mm.
- Mm.

672
00:34:39,571 --> 00:34:40,873
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

673
00:34:40,907 --> 00:34:43,910
I, uh... I think I might
slip out of this.

674
00:34:43,943 --> 00:34:47,546
Ooh, okay,
well I'm right behind you.

675
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:49,916
(ringing)

676
00:34:52,451 --> 00:34:53,786
Hello.

677
00:34:55,655 --> 00:34:57,389
Hi, yeah.

678
00:35:00,693 --> 00:35:02,695
Really... really, right now?

679
00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:06,364
Uh.

680
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:08,668
Okay, I could be there
in about 20 minutes.

681
00:35:10,502 --> 00:35:13,472
Okay, all right, thank you, bye.

682
00:35:13,505 --> 00:35:15,273
Who was that?

683
00:35:15,307 --> 00:35:16,709
That was Ms. Devereaux.

684
00:35:16,743 --> 00:35:18,376
She said my direct deposit
ain't going through,

685
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,278
and she wants
to give me a check.

686
00:35:20,312 --> 00:35:22,048
Uh, now?

687
00:35:22,081 --> 00:35:24,784
Yeah, I mean,
she was pretty insistent, yeah,

688
00:35:24,817 --> 00:35:26,886
and I've been
waiting on this check.

689
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:29,989
So, you're gonna go all the way
to her office on a Sunday night?

690
00:35:32,324 --> 00:35:35,594
To her office, yeah,
I am, I mean...

691
00:35:35,628 --> 00:35:38,965
I mean, I guess I could
just wait till tomorrow, but...

692
00:35:38,998 --> 00:35:41,566
No, no, no, you, uh...

693
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,002
you work for them.

694
00:35:43,035 --> 00:35:45,838
I can wait.

696
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,843

- Hey, come on in.

705
00:36:30,016 --> 00:36:31,784
Okay, thank you.

706
00:36:33,618 --> 00:36:35,554
Do you want some wine?

707
00:36:35,587 --> 00:36:37,023
I was drinking a little earlier.

708
00:36:37,056 --> 00:36:38,958
I don't know if I should, uh...

709
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:42,028
Okay, well, indulge me.

710
00:36:42,061 --> 00:36:44,664
It's just a little taste.

711
00:36:44,697 --> 00:36:46,098

This is much more than...

I appreciate everything
that you've been doing,

717
00:37:11,489 --> 00:37:14,660
so that's
a little bit of a bonus.

718
00:37:14,694 --> 00:37:17,096
Well, thank you,
I really appreciate that.

719
00:37:17,129 --> 00:37:19,799
- That's sweet.
- Um, do you have anything else

720
00:37:19,832 --> 00:37:21,968

00:37:47,592 --> 00:37:50,462
Well, I think he does most
of the heavy lifting for us,

729
00:37:50,495 --> 00:37:51,697
you know?

730
00:37:51,731 --> 00:37:53,866
I'm just there
to keep him company.

731
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,500
Mhm.

732
00:37:57,469 --> 00:38:00,072
You know, um,
my mom used to tell me

733
00:38:00,106 --> 00:38:04,944
that he's very charming,

734
00:38:04,977 --> 00:38:08,814
and handsome, and funny even.

735
00:38:08,848 --> 00:38:10,582
I mean, I don't see it.

736
00:38:10,615 --> 00:38:13,152
(♪♪♪)

737
00:38:13,185 --> 00:38:15,922
Do you?

738
00:38:15,955 --> 00:38:17,589
Well, I don't know
about handsome.

739
00:38:17,622 --> 00:38:19,759
(chuckling)

740
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:21,160
No, but he's, uh...

741
00:38:21,193 --> 00:38:24,096
he's... he's a good person.

742
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:26,531
He's sharp.

743
00:38:26,564 --> 00:38:28,834
Hm.

744
00:38:28,868 --> 00:38:30,937
What happened...
what happened to your mother?

745
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:33,505
(breathing heavily)

746
00:38:33,538 --> 00:38:35,741
(♪♪♪)

747
00:38:35,775 --> 00:38:37,677
Cancer.

748
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,845
(♪♪♪)

749
00:38:39,879 --> 00:38:41,714
She died.

750
00:38:41,747 --> 00:38:43,581
(♪♪♪)

751
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:45,718
I was 19.

752
00:38:45,751 --> 00:38:47,753
(♪♪♪)

753
00:38:47,787 --> 00:38:49,088
I was there for the whole thing.

754
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:51,157
I saw the whole thing.

755
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,125
(♪♪♪)

756
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:56,561
And, um...

757
00:38:56,594 --> 00:38:58,864
and then she was gone.

758
00:38:58,898 --> 00:39:04,670
(♪♪♪)

759
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:07,273
Next thing I know, I'm working
for Gregory's company.

760
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:10,542
(♪♪♪)

761
00:39:10,575 --> 00:39:14,146
Is that why you're so distant,

762
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,582
because, you know,
he reminds you of your mother?

763
00:39:17,615 --> 00:39:21,120
(♪♪♪)

764
00:39:21,153 --> 00:39:22,587
Hm.

765
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,589
(♪♪♪)

766
00:39:24,622 --> 00:39:28,761
It's a little bit
more complicated than that.

767
00:39:28,794 --> 00:39:32,665
We're more like
business associates.

768
00:39:32,698 --> 00:39:36,135
We're not nearly as close
as you two are.

769
00:39:36,168 --> 00:39:39,705
(♪♪♪)

770
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:42,141
So I guess that makes me
a little jealous.

771
00:39:42,174 --> 00:39:47,612
(♪♪♪)

772
00:39:47,646 --> 00:39:50,716
No, I just think he sees
a little bit of himself in me.

773
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,584
That's all.

774
00:39:52,617 --> 00:39:56,689
What, charming, funny?

775
00:39:56,722 --> 00:39:58,324
Handsome.

776
00:39:58,357 --> 00:40:08,300
(♪♪♪)

777
00:40:22,715 --> 00:40:24,817
Oh, uh...

778
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:27,319
I don't think
we should do this.

779
00:40:27,353 --> 00:40:29,088
Are you sure?

780
00:40:29,121 --> 00:40:33,125
Yeah, I don't think
this is a good idea, Barbara.

781
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:36,629
(♪♪♪)

782
00:40:36,662 --> 00:40:39,065
I don't think we should do that.

783
00:40:39,098 --> 00:40:42,168
That might
get kind of complicated.

784
00:40:42,201 --> 00:40:45,071
(♪♪♪)

785
00:40:45,104 --> 00:40:46,906
I think I should go.

786
00:40:46,939 --> 00:40:48,074
(♪♪♪)

787
00:40:48,107 --> 00:40:49,041
I think I should go.

788
00:40:49,075 --> 00:40:59,018
(♪♪♪)

789
00:41:02,788 --> 00:41:05,291
I'm sorry.

790
00:41:05,324 --> 00:41:07,126
I'm in love with someone else,

791
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:10,362
and I think
this would be a mistake.

792
00:41:10,396 --> 00:41:15,634
(♪♪♪)

793
00:41:15,668 --> 00:41:18,003
Don't forget your check.

794
00:41:18,037 --> 00:41:27,980
(♪♪♪)

795
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:34,787
Goodnight.

796
00:41:54,106 --> 00:41:57,076
I'm sorry
about your friend, Gregory.

797
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,383
There's always something
in this life you didn't do.

798
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:11,090
Always something you didn't do.

799
00:42:13,325 --> 00:42:16,362
I was surprised that Barbara
took you to the service.

800
00:42:16,395 --> 00:42:18,764
That was nice of her.

801
00:42:18,797 --> 00:42:20,399
She didn't do it for me.

802
00:42:21,901 --> 00:42:24,036
Why you guys beefing, man?

803
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:25,871
Excuse me?

804
00:42:25,905 --> 00:42:27,907
Why do the two of you
have a problem?

805
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,009
That's none of your business.

806
00:42:33,913 --> 00:42:36,482
Has she ever
been married before?

807
00:42:36,515 --> 00:42:38,284
Who, Barbara?

808
00:42:39,818 --> 00:42:42,288
She's too bitter of a woman.

809
00:42:58,237 --> 00:43:00,306
Where the hell you going?

810
00:43:00,339 --> 00:43:04,376
I'm off, and I got
a couple errands I gotta run.

811
00:43:08,013 --> 00:43:09,014
You all right?

812
00:43:09,048 --> 00:43:11,850
I'm fine.

813
00:43:11,884 --> 00:43:13,419
All right.

814
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:20,092
Just fine.

815
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:31,470
(♪♪♪)

816
00:43:31,503 --> 00:43:33,839
Thanks for letting me come by.

817
00:43:33,872 --> 00:43:35,107
It's no problem.

818
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,775
(♪♪♪)

819
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:38,911
Look, Jenetta.

820
00:43:38,944 --> 00:43:42,881
I don't want it to be
like this between us.

821
00:43:42,915 --> 00:43:45,351
We've got history.

822
00:43:45,384 --> 00:43:47,786
And I know you can handle
everything on your own, but...

823
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:53,025
(♪♪♪)

824
00:43:53,058 --> 00:43:54,927
I don't wanna run away.

825
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,795
(♪♪♪)

826
00:43:56,829 --> 00:43:58,564
So you're not moving
to New York?

827
00:43:58,597 --> 00:44:04,103
(♪♪♪)

828
00:44:04,136 --> 00:44:05,204
Here.

829
00:44:05,237 --> 00:44:08,974
(♪♪♪)

830
00:44:09,008 --> 00:44:10,342
I thought you might want it.

831
00:44:10,376 --> 00:44:20,319
(♪♪♪)

832
00:44:33,198 --> 00:44:36,969
(door squeaking)

833
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:43,142
Payton.

834
00:44:43,175 --> 00:44:44,276
Hey.

835
00:44:46,512 --> 00:44:48,447
How you doing?

836
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,416
Uh, all right.

837
00:44:50,449 --> 00:44:51,850
Yeah, you okay?

838
00:44:51,884 --> 00:44:54,987
Yeah, um, just tired.

839
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,221
Yeah?

840
00:44:56,255 --> 00:44:58,357
Well, I wanted to take you out
if we could go out tonight.

841
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:59,591
I wanted to show you something.

842
00:44:59,625 --> 00:45:02,094
No, I'm just...
I had a really long day,

843
00:45:02,127 --> 00:45:04,096
- I'm just really tired.
- Just for a little while.

844
00:45:04,129 --> 00:45:05,531
I just wanna take you somewhere

845
00:45:05,564 --> 00:45:08,934
and show you something.

846
00:45:08,967 --> 00:45:10,302
Just come with me, please?

847
00:45:10,336 --> 00:45:12,371
(distant sirens blaring)

848
00:45:12,404 --> 00:45:14,406
Just come with me, please?

849
00:45:15,974 --> 00:45:17,309
Fine.

850
00:45:17,343 --> 00:45:18,410
Come on.

851
00:45:18,444 --> 00:45:20,179
It won't be long.

852
00:45:22,214 --> 00:45:25,250
You know, my grandmother,
she's still a mystery to me.

853
00:45:25,284 --> 00:45:28,554
(insects chirping)

854
00:45:28,587 --> 00:45:30,923
She'd bring us out here
when I was little,

855
00:45:30,956 --> 00:45:36,962
and we would just stare out
at the lights for hours.

856
00:45:40,366 --> 00:45:42,601
And I never knew why.

857
00:45:46,271 --> 00:45:49,676
And when she was dying,

858
00:45:49,709 --> 00:45:51,910
I remember her telling me,
"Payton,

859
00:45:51,944 --> 00:45:54,179
make something of yourself.

860
00:45:54,213 --> 00:45:56,649
Be somebody.

861
00:45:56,683 --> 00:45:58,350
Get out of here."

862
00:46:04,523 --> 00:46:05,557
And I'm gonna miss it here,

863
00:46:05,591 --> 00:46:09,161
but not as much
if I didn't have you, Shannon.

864
00:46:09,194 --> 00:46:10,596
And I know that.

865
00:46:12,965 --> 00:46:15,200
And I can't wait
to marry you, baby.

866
00:46:19,204 --> 00:46:21,907
But I have
to tell you something.

867
00:46:25,477 --> 00:46:26,445
- Shannon...
- I know you've been

868
00:46:26,478 --> 00:46:29,348
cheating on me, Payton.

869
00:46:29,381 --> 00:46:30,349
What?

870
00:46:32,418 --> 00:46:34,153
I checked your phone.

871
00:46:35,421 --> 00:46:38,323
Been seeing Jenetta again.

872
00:46:38,357 --> 00:46:41,661
- Shannon, I haven't...
- I saw the texts, Payton.

873
00:46:41,694 --> 00:46:43,362
I know that you have.

874
00:46:43,395 --> 00:46:44,664
Look at me.

875
00:46:49,468 --> 00:46:52,104
I haven't been seeing
Jenetta again, okay?

876
00:46:52,137 --> 00:46:54,373
Then why are you still
talking to her?

877
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:01,113
Because she's pregnant.

878
00:47:07,386 --> 00:47:08,987
And it's yours?

879
00:47:18,297 --> 00:47:21,400
(heavy breathing)

880
00:47:29,141 --> 00:47:30,342
Shannon.

881
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:40,252
How do you know?

882
00:47:40,285 --> 00:47:41,620
Hm?

883
00:47:41,654 --> 00:47:42,722
What do you mean how do I know?

884
00:47:42,755 --> 00:47:44,757
That baby could be anybody's.

885
00:47:46,793 --> 00:47:49,061
- She's not lying.
- She doesn't have anything,

886
00:47:49,094 --> 00:47:51,029
Payton.

887
00:47:51,063 --> 00:47:53,633
You are finally
making real money.

888
00:47:53,666 --> 00:47:56,703
Wake up, she is using you!

889
00:47:56,736 --> 00:47:58,738
Using me for what?

890
00:47:58,771 --> 00:48:01,573
To support a child
that she cannot!

891
00:48:04,109 --> 00:48:05,712
That's fucked up.

892
00:48:07,179 --> 00:48:09,281
No, what's fucked up

893
00:48:09,314 --> 00:48:12,618
is that you are just now
telling me she's pregnant.

894
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,060
I'm sorry.

895
00:48:23,863 --> 00:48:25,597
Sorry.

896
00:48:29,201 --> 00:48:31,436
You have to get
a paternity test.

897
00:48:35,274 --> 00:48:36,709
If you don't...

898
00:48:38,745 --> 00:48:40,245
we're done.

899
00:48:43,515 --> 00:48:46,618
My first child is not
gonna be somebody else's.

900
00:48:50,289 --> 00:48:52,357
I just wanna get out of here.

901
00:49:04,202 --> 00:49:09,508
What I'm gonna ask her for
is a paternity test.

902
00:49:09,541 --> 00:49:12,779
Well, we all know the answer
to that, don't we?

903
00:49:14,613 --> 00:49:16,214
I love Shannon, Gregory,

904
00:49:16,248 --> 00:49:18,250
and we're getting married,
all right?

905
00:49:18,283 --> 00:49:20,853
All I'm asking is
for you to be there for me.

906
00:49:20,887 --> 00:49:23,221
That's it.

907
00:49:23,255 --> 00:49:25,692
Is your newborn baby
gonna be there?

908
00:49:32,164 --> 00:49:33,733
Are you gonna be there or not?

909
00:49:33,766 --> 00:49:37,169
I'll be goddammed
if I show up to that wedding.

910
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:41,340
You're making
a terrible mistake, son.

911
00:49:41,373 --> 00:49:42,675
Gregory, you don't know me.

912
00:49:42,709 --> 00:49:46,178
I know you better
than your own father.

913
00:49:46,211 --> 00:49:48,547
He chose not to be
in your life.

914
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:52,752
He chose not to do
the right thing.

915
00:49:52,785 --> 00:49:55,487
Don't make
the same mistake, son.

916
00:49:57,322 --> 00:49:59,191
You're not my father, either.

917
00:50:00,592 --> 00:50:02,527
No, I'm not.

918
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:07,299
You never had one,

919
00:50:07,332 --> 00:50:10,135
and now neither will your kid.

920
00:50:29,956 --> 00:50:32,557
(grunting)

921
00:50:48,775 --> 00:50:51,276
(keyboard keys clacking)

922
00:50:56,415 --> 00:50:58,718
(cell phone ringing)

923
00:51:14,834 --> 00:51:16,501
- Hello.
- This is Barbara.

924
00:51:16,535 --> 00:51:17,637
Sorry I missed your call.

925
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:19,504
I'll get back to you soon.

926
00:51:49,601 --> 00:51:51,003
(groaning)

927
00:52:01,513 --> 00:52:05,383
(clattering)

928
00:52:05,417 --> 00:52:07,854
(groaning)

929
00:52:14,861 --> 00:52:16,863
Oh, shit.

930
00:52:18,898 --> 00:52:21,600
(clock ticking)

931
00:52:31,476 --> 00:52:33,345
I came as fast as I could.

932
00:52:33,378 --> 00:52:35,848
I'm so sorry.

933
00:52:35,882 --> 00:52:38,684
Is he all right?

934
00:52:38,718 --> 00:52:42,621
He'll probably die
a lot faster now.

935
00:52:42,655 --> 00:52:44,623
Oh, my God, man.

936
00:52:46,058 --> 00:52:47,160
I don't know what I done.

937
00:52:47,193 --> 00:52:49,762
Don't be emotional, Payton,
it's unattractive.

938
00:52:49,796 --> 00:52:52,531
What?

939
00:52:52,564 --> 00:52:53,598
It's my problem.

940
00:52:53,633 --> 00:52:55,768
It's my father,
you made that perfectly clear

941
00:52:55,802 --> 00:52:57,970
by vanishing
in the middle of the day.

942
00:52:58,004 --> 00:52:59,571
We got into an argument.

943
00:52:59,604 --> 00:53:00,673
Grumpy, shitty old men

944
00:53:00,706 --> 00:53:02,407
give their nurses hell
all the time.

945
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,510
I pay you to take it.

946
00:53:05,544 --> 00:53:08,580
Is this about
the other night, Barbara?

947
00:53:08,613 --> 00:53:11,416
(laughing)

948
00:53:11,449 --> 00:53:13,385
Don't flatter yourself, Payton.

949
00:53:13,418 --> 00:53:14,787
Well then what the hell
is your problem?

950
00:53:14,821 --> 00:53:16,022
- My problem?
- Yeah.

951
00:53:16,055 --> 00:53:17,924
I mean, he's dying
in the other room

952
00:53:17,957 --> 00:53:19,558
and you're sitting here
talking about him like that.

953
00:53:19,591 --> 00:53:22,128
There's no compassion
or loyalty or love.

954
00:53:22,161 --> 00:53:23,129
Anything.

955
00:53:23,162 --> 00:53:25,463
I don't owe him any of that.

956
00:53:25,497 --> 00:53:27,633
- But he's your fucking father.
- He's my fucking father.

957
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:30,770
He's my fucking father.

958
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:36,843
You spend a few months with him,
have a couple of drinks,

959
00:53:36,876 --> 00:53:39,544
and now all of a sudden
he's the father of the year?

960
00:53:42,648 --> 00:53:45,517
Well, guess what?
He was never there for me.

961
00:53:48,187 --> 00:53:50,723
He knocked up a waitress,
bought her a house

962
00:53:50,756 --> 00:53:52,792
as far away
from everyone as possible.

963
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:59,031
I didn't even meet him
until I was 19.

964
00:54:02,434 --> 00:54:05,638
And my mother is dying.

965
00:54:09,675 --> 00:54:11,610
In walks this man
in a glorious suit

966
00:54:11,644 --> 00:54:13,445
who says to me,
"You're smart,

967
00:54:13,478 --> 00:54:14,412
you can be something.

968
00:54:14,446 --> 00:54:17,817
Oh, and by the way,
you're my daughter."

969
00:54:22,554 --> 00:54:25,024
I guess he didn't have a son
worth saving.

970
00:54:29,561 --> 00:54:35,001
I changed my name to Devereaux
when my mother died.

971
00:54:36,736 --> 00:54:38,804
So I don't owe him nothing.

972
00:55:01,193 --> 00:55:02,929
Gregory.

973
00:55:02,962 --> 00:55:05,064
You finally made it.

974
00:55:05,097 --> 00:55:07,499
Is it true?

975
00:55:07,532 --> 00:55:09,567
I couldn't reach the albums.

976
00:55:09,601 --> 00:55:11,137
Is it true
what Barbara just told me?

977
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:13,538
An old man
can't do nothing anymore.

978
00:55:13,571 --> 00:55:14,974
Did you abandon her?

979
00:55:15,007 --> 00:55:16,208
What?

980
00:55:16,242 --> 00:55:18,945
Did you abandon her?

981
00:55:18,978 --> 00:55:21,147
Everything she is

982
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:23,615
is thanks to me.

983
00:55:23,649 --> 00:55:27,954
Oh, you're the same, Payton.

984
00:55:27,987 --> 00:55:29,855
Can't keep your dick
in your pants.

985
00:55:29,889 --> 00:55:31,523
Fuck you and all
your moral bullshit,

986
00:55:31,556 --> 00:55:32,959
- Gregory, okay?
- Listen.

987
00:55:32,992 --> 00:55:34,727
No, I'm not
some fucking millionaire

988
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,228
riding around here
banging waitresses

989
00:55:36,262 --> 00:55:38,064
- and leaving 'em.
- I'm just trying to keep you

990
00:55:38,097 --> 00:55:39,832
- from making the same...
- No, you're a liar,

991
00:55:39,865 --> 00:55:42,234
and you're a hypocrite,
and you're a cheat.

992
00:55:42,268 --> 00:55:44,804
And you're looking for somebody
to handle all your old sins,

993
00:55:44,837 --> 00:55:45,805
and it's not me.

994
00:55:46,872 --> 00:55:48,674
Get out.

995
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:49,675
I'm done, man.

996
00:55:49,709 --> 00:55:51,243
Get out.

997
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:06,025
I mean, yeah,
you're moving on now

998
00:56:06,058 --> 00:56:07,793
and you got the money,

999
00:56:07,827 --> 00:56:09,061
but Payton,
the last thing you need to do

1000
00:56:09,095 --> 00:56:11,529
is be yelling
at some old, dying man.

1001
00:56:11,563 --> 00:56:13,966
Especially this one
who does a lot for you.

1002
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,768
I think you should go back.

1003
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:19,705
- Jenetta.
- What is it?

1004
00:56:21,307 --> 00:56:23,541
I want a paternity test.

1005
00:56:27,947 --> 00:56:29,949
Yeah, I mean, it's not that
I don't trust you or anything,

1006
00:56:29,982 --> 00:56:32,617
but I think there's a lot
of legal liabilities with this,

1007
00:56:32,651 --> 00:56:36,689
and it'd be best
if we both just knew for sure.

1008
00:56:40,793 --> 00:56:42,828
- Did she ask you this?
- No.

1009
00:56:42,862 --> 00:56:44,730
- She told you to ask me that.
- No, I'm asking you that.

1010
00:56:44,764 --> 00:56:45,898
I wanna ask you that.

1011
00:56:48,267 --> 00:56:50,002
It seems like it's coming
from out of nowhere.

1012
00:56:50,036 --> 00:56:51,303
That's why I don't...

1013
00:56:54,173 --> 00:56:55,274
Okay.

1014
00:56:56,942 --> 00:56:57,810
Fuck you, Payton.

1015
00:57:01,847 --> 00:57:03,682
Jenetta.

1016
00:57:03,716 --> 00:57:05,017
Jenetta!

1017
00:57:05,051 --> 00:57:07,987
Jenetta. Jenetta.

1018
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,088
- Don't talk to me.
- I'm trying to talk to you,

1019
00:57:09,121 --> 00:57:09,989
Jenetta, come on!

1020
00:57:10,022 --> 00:57:12,024
- Jenetta, stop fucking...
- Do not touch me!

1021
00:57:12,058 --> 00:57:13,692
I'm not trying to talk to you,
not anymore.

1022
00:57:13,726 --> 00:57:14,559
Oh, really,
you don't wanna talk to me?

1023
00:57:14,592 --> 00:57:15,661
- No.
- You don't wanna talk to me?

1024
00:57:15,694 --> 00:57:17,363
You text me every single day
asking to come see me

1025
00:57:17,396 --> 00:57:19,098
and asking me
to feel your baby bump.

1026
00:57:19,131 --> 00:57:20,900
That's because I want you
to be in his life,

1027
00:57:20,933 --> 00:57:22,968
and I'm trying to give you
the opportunity.

1028
00:57:23,002 --> 00:57:24,203
No, you're trap...

1029
00:57:24,236 --> 00:57:26,072
I'm not... what you gon' say,
I'm trying to trap you?

1030
00:57:26,105 --> 00:57:27,873
You're trapping me
into being a fucking father.

1031
00:57:27,907 --> 00:57:29,208
You're guilt tripping me
into being a father.

1032
00:57:29,241 --> 00:57:30,643
I'm not ready to be a father,
Jenetta.

1033
00:57:30,676 --> 00:57:32,144
Did I do this shit myself?

1034
00:57:32,178 --> 00:57:33,312
Is that what you think?

1035
00:57:33,345 --> 00:57:36,882
- I don't want to be a father.
- Wow.

1036
00:57:36,916 --> 00:57:39,085
Well, get the fuck off my car.

1037
00:57:39,118 --> 00:57:41,353
Get the fuck off my car.

1038
00:57:41,387 --> 00:57:43,055
Get off my car!

1039
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:46,692
You coming at me
like I'm some whore,

1040
00:57:46,725 --> 00:57:47,860
and you known me
longer than that.

1041
00:57:47,893 --> 00:57:51,864
And your grandma would be
so ashamed of you right now.

1042
00:57:51,897 --> 00:57:53,899
You don't even fucking care.

1043
00:57:58,737 --> 00:58:01,006
You know, I hate you.

1044
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,342
Get on my nerves.

1045
00:58:03,375 --> 00:58:06,045
No, just run,
that's what you be.

1046
00:58:08,747 --> 00:58:10,382
Fuck this shit.

1047
00:58:10,416 --> 00:58:12,017
Fuck you, Payton.

1048
00:58:16,021 --> 00:58:18,023
(engine starting)

1049
00:58:21,927 --> 00:58:31,871
(♪♪♪)

1050
00:59:12,478 --> 00:59:14,246
I got the test.

1051
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,848
(♪♪♪)

1052
00:59:15,881 --> 00:59:16,982
Really?

1053
00:59:17,016 --> 00:59:18,817
(♪♪♪)

1054
00:59:18,851 --> 00:59:20,753
Yeah.

1055
00:59:20,786 --> 00:59:22,154
And it was negative.

1056
00:59:22,188 --> 00:59:26,725
(♪♪♪)

1057
00:59:26,759 --> 00:59:28,327
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1058
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:31,730
I'm so sorry, baby,
'cause I know I fucked up.

1059
00:59:31,764 --> 00:59:33,933
And I love you, Shannon.

1060
00:59:33,966 --> 00:59:35,167
I love you, too.

1061
00:59:35,201 --> 00:59:39,905
(♪♪♪)

1062
00:59:39,939 --> 00:59:41,440
I love you.

1063
00:59:51,984 --> 00:59:54,186
Shit.

1064
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:57,056
Piss.

1065
00:59:57,089 --> 00:59:59,258
You shouldn't have to do that.

1066
00:59:59,291 --> 01:00:04,129
Yeah, well, stop driving
every fucking nurse away.

1067
01:00:04,163 --> 01:00:06,765
(coughing)

1068
01:00:12,271 --> 01:00:13,906
Help me.

1069
01:00:13,939 --> 01:00:16,475
Help me,
can't you see I'm dying?

1070
01:00:25,351 --> 01:00:28,120
Where's... where's Payton?

1071
01:00:28,153 --> 01:00:29,421
Where's Payton?

1072
01:00:29,455 --> 01:00:31,457
Why isn't he here?

1073
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:33,759
(coughing)

1074
01:00:36,929 --> 01:00:38,197
We had an agreement.

1075
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:39,798
I never fired you.

1076
01:00:39,832 --> 01:00:41,000
I never said that you can go,

1077
01:00:41,033 --> 01:00:42,935
I never let you go.

1078
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:48,974
And he's asking for you,

1079
01:00:49,008 --> 01:00:51,110
'cause he says that I'm not you.

1080
01:00:53,012 --> 01:00:56,548
Payton, please call me back.

1081
01:00:56,582 --> 01:01:01,587
Man, I didn't realize
they have so many problems.

1082
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:04,123
(electric razor buzzing)

1083
01:01:04,156 --> 01:01:06,225
So you're gonna go, right?

1084
01:01:15,968 --> 01:01:18,170
It's the least you could do,
Payton.

1085
01:01:21,373 --> 01:01:24,209
(sighing)

1086
01:01:24,243 --> 01:01:27,379
It would be the right thing.

1087
01:01:34,153 --> 01:01:35,921
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1088
01:01:44,330 --> 01:01:46,298
(knocking)

1089
01:01:59,044 --> 01:02:01,046
(groaning)

1090
01:02:12,391 --> 01:02:14,259
I'm sorry.

1091
01:02:15,994 --> 01:02:18,163
That's what I wanted to say.

1092
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:22,935
I'm sorry, too.

1093
01:02:22,968 --> 01:02:24,970
Well, good.

1094
01:02:25,003 --> 01:02:26,238
You should be.

1095
01:02:26,271 --> 01:02:29,508
(chuckles)

1096
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:30,943
So...

1097
01:02:32,679 --> 01:02:35,381
You're still gonna
marry that girl, huh?

1098
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:40,586
Maybe it'll work out.

1099
01:02:42,388 --> 01:02:44,556
It's worth taking a shot.

1100
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:55,601
I met Barbara's mother...

1101
01:02:55,635 --> 01:03:00,406
in a little diner
called the Serving Spoon.

1102
01:03:03,409 --> 01:03:05,577
She called me by my first name.

1103
01:03:08,715 --> 01:03:12,652
Smiled a big smile.

1104
01:03:15,587 --> 01:03:18,023
Her name was Diana.

1105
01:03:21,728 --> 01:03:25,531
I wonder what she thought about

1106
01:03:25,564 --> 01:03:27,466
when she was dying.

1107
01:03:30,102 --> 01:03:32,070
I wonder if she...

1108
01:03:34,106 --> 01:03:35,708
if she was afraid.

1109
01:03:37,409 --> 01:03:39,511
If she blamed me.

1110
01:03:44,149 --> 01:03:46,351
I abandoned her.

1111
01:03:50,657 --> 01:03:54,226
I didn't give her a thing.

1112
01:03:54,259 --> 01:03:56,495
Are you afraid to die?

1113
01:03:59,699 --> 01:04:03,535
You gotta give to get, Payton.

1114
01:04:05,805 --> 01:04:09,007
You're a good kid.

1115
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:12,010
You might be a good man,
I don't know.

1116
01:04:14,246 --> 01:04:17,149
It doesn't have to be like this.

1117
01:04:19,218 --> 01:04:21,987
You don't have to be sorry.

1118
01:04:34,066 --> 01:04:35,300
You don't.

1119
01:04:43,843 --> 01:04:53,786

1120
01:04:55,621 --> 01:04:58,758

(♪♪♪)

1122
01:05:08,801 --> 01:05:11,303
Is it weird to beat yourself?

(♪♪♪)

1124
01:05:13,706 --> 01:05:15,541
You guys figure out
your shit yet?

1125
01:05:15,574 --> 01:05:17,276
You coming back?

1126
01:05:17,309 --> 01:05:19,545
(♪♪♪)

1127
01:05:19,578 --> 01:05:23,382
I'm moving, Barbara,
I'm getting married.

1128
01:05:23,415 --> 01:05:26,151
I see.

1129
01:05:26,184 --> 01:05:28,120
And you came here
knowing all that?

1130
01:05:28,153 --> 01:05:29,789
Well, it wasn't about that.

1131
01:05:29,822 --> 01:05:32,457
(♪♪♪)

1132
01:05:32,491 --> 01:05:34,526
So what?

1133
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:39,364
You feel better about yourself
for letting him fall?

1134
01:05:39,398 --> 01:05:41,266
For leaving when he needed you?

1135
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:42,134
Barbara.

1136
01:05:43,903 --> 01:05:46,305
He's sorry.

1137
01:05:46,338 --> 01:05:47,573
No, he's not.

1138
01:05:47,606 --> 01:05:50,175
(♪♪♪)

1139
01:05:50,208 --> 01:05:52,611
He's never been sorry
for anything in his entire life.

1140
01:05:53,846 --> 01:05:56,248
Well, what if he is?

1141
01:05:56,281 --> 01:05:58,785
What if for the first time
in his life he is sorry?

1142
01:05:58,818 --> 01:06:02,220
Wouldn't you love that?
Isn't that what you want?

1143
01:06:02,254 --> 01:06:04,691
For that old motherfucker
to be sorry?

1144
01:06:04,724 --> 01:06:10,697
(♪♪♪)

1145
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:13,465
Just come in
and see him, Barbara.

1146
01:06:13,498 --> 01:06:14,901
You know?

1147
01:06:14,934 --> 01:06:17,436
Just come in and just see him.

1148
01:06:17,469 --> 01:06:27,412
(♪♪♪)

1149
01:06:33,886 --> 01:06:36,622
You like seeing me like this,
don't you?

1150
01:06:38,825 --> 01:06:40,793
It makes you feel good.

1151
01:06:44,229 --> 01:06:45,832
She's seen it before, Gregory.

1152
01:06:45,865 --> 01:06:47,767
Oh.

1153
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,736
Of course she has.

1154
01:06:51,536 --> 01:06:55,507
She's held it over my head
for decades.

1155
01:06:55,540 --> 01:07:00,245
Like I killed her mother.

1156
01:07:00,278 --> 01:07:02,749
I didn't give her cancer.

1157
01:07:02,782 --> 01:07:04,616
I didn't do that.

1158
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:10,555
Just tell her
what you wanna tell her.

1159
01:07:12,257 --> 01:07:13,860
He's not gonna say it.

1160
01:07:16,829 --> 01:07:18,698
This is the last chance.

1161
01:07:19,999 --> 01:07:22,300
He'll die before he does.

1162
01:07:24,369 --> 01:07:26,873
You're not gonna have
another chance.

1163
01:07:29,307 --> 01:07:31,610
I wasted my life.

1164
01:07:36,248 --> 01:07:39,351
I wasted my life not loving you.

1165
01:07:41,586 --> 01:07:43,756
Not being there for you.

1166
01:07:45,958 --> 01:07:48,293
And it's my loss.

1167
01:07:50,029 --> 01:07:53,532
I lost my whole life.

1168
01:08:00,807 --> 01:08:02,909
I'm sorry to you.

1169
01:08:05,978 --> 01:08:09,581
I'm sorry to your mother.

1170
01:08:12,819 --> 01:08:14,319
Barbara.

1171
01:08:15,655 --> 01:08:19,458
Barbara, I'm dying.

1172
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,696
You don't have to forgive me.

1173
01:08:25,497 --> 01:08:27,967
I don't forgive myself.

1174
01:08:30,636 --> 01:08:32,939
But pl...

1175
01:08:32,972 --> 01:08:34,573
Please.

1176
01:08:36,943 --> 01:08:37,877
Stay.

1177
01:08:42,715 --> 01:08:43,883
Please.

1178
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:49,882

1180
01:10:11,603 --> 01:10:13,673
Hey, son.

1181
01:10:13,706 --> 01:10:15,074
Feels like the real thing, huh?

1182
01:10:15,107 --> 01:10:16,943
Oh, it sure does,
it sure does.

1183
01:10:16,976 --> 01:10:18,144
Have a drink.

1184
01:10:18,177 --> 01:10:19,946
It's gonna take them a couple
more hours to get ready,

1185
01:10:19,979 --> 01:10:21,513
and we'll head on over.

1186
01:10:21,546 --> 01:10:22,882
I'm actually gonna get
a cup of coffee.

1187
01:10:22,915 --> 01:10:25,517
- Do you wanna join me?
- I'm good.

01:11:00,887 --> 01:11:02,520
Hello?

1191
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:07,059
Hey.

1192
01:11:08,995 --> 01:11:13,565
Um... he's gone.

1193
01:11:13,598 --> 01:11:14,934
Dad's gone.

1194
01:11:26,611 --> 01:11:28,513
Were you with him?

1195
01:11:28,546 --> 01:11:29,649
Yeah.

1196
01:11:32,617 --> 01:11:34,053
The whole time?

1197
01:11:37,189 --> 01:11:38,891
Yep, the whole time.

1198
01:11:40,558 --> 01:11:42,560
I'm just glad
that I was able to be here

1199
01:11:42,594 --> 01:11:44,596
to walk him through.

1200
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:46,598
Did you guys get to talk?

1201
01:11:46,632 --> 01:11:47,934
Yeah.

1202
01:11:51,804 --> 01:11:54,941
Hey, thank you for everything.

1203
01:11:54,974 --> 01:11:57,542
Thank you so much.

1204
01:11:57,575 --> 01:11:59,611
Good luck with your wedding.

1205
01:12:02,048 --> 01:12:03,716
Thank you.

I need to talk to Shannon,

Do you really need
to do this now?

I need to talk to you.

1217
01:13:32,271 --> 01:13:34,140
Okay.

1218
01:13:34,173 --> 01:13:36,175
Just give us a sec.

1219
01:13:41,113 --> 01:13:43,049
Is everything okay?
What's going on?

1220
01:13:44,784 --> 01:13:46,986
Gregory passed away.

1221
01:13:47,019 --> 01:13:49,621
Oh, baby, I am so sorry.

1222
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,630
I'm here, though, I'm here.

1223
01:13:57,663 --> 01:13:58,998
Okay?

1224
01:14:00,332 --> 01:14:02,768
- Shannon.
- Yeah?

- I love you.
- I love you, too, baby.

1226
01:14:06,305 --> 01:14:09,942
And I wanna...
I wanna do right by you.

1227
01:14:09,975 --> 01:14:11,277
Okay.

1228
01:14:15,247 --> 01:14:17,349
I lied about the baby.

1229
01:14:19,952 --> 01:14:23,122
It's mine,
and I know it's mine.

1230
01:14:25,658 --> 01:14:26,992
What?

1231
01:14:28,427 --> 01:14:32,398
And I love you
and I wanna marry you,

1232
01:14:32,431 --> 01:14:35,234
but I also wanna be
in my child's life.

1233
01:14:35,267 --> 01:14:37,036
- No.
- No?

1234
01:14:37,069 --> 01:14:38,804
No, you...

1235
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:43,375
You have to choose, Payton.

1236
01:14:43,409 --> 01:14:45,111
It is either me

1237
01:14:45,144 --> 01:14:47,279
and the family
we're gonna have together

1238
01:14:47,313 --> 01:14:48,714
or that.

1239
01:14:48,747 --> 01:14:50,416
I want a life with you.

1240
01:14:50,449 --> 01:14:53,819
- That's all I want.
- I told you I cannot...

1241
01:14:53,853 --> 01:14:59,358
I can't have... I can't have
a child that is not mine.

1242
01:14:59,391 --> 01:15:01,927
No!

1243
01:15:01,961 --> 01:15:03,429
And I can't have a child
that I'm not there for.

1244
01:15:03,462 --> 01:15:05,364
No, this is supposed to be us.

1245
01:15:05,397 --> 01:15:07,867
What are you talking about,
Payton?

1246
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:10,803
I didn't have a father!

1247
01:15:10,836 --> 01:15:14,073
I can't do that to my kid!

1248
01:15:14,106 --> 01:15:16,442
Don't you understand?

1249
01:15:16,475 --> 01:15:18,811
I can't abandon my child.

1250
01:15:18,844 --> 01:15:20,412
It's not fair.

1251
01:15:23,415 --> 01:15:26,719
I didn't have a father, Shannon.

1252
01:15:26,752 --> 01:15:28,254
That hurt.

1253
01:15:28,287 --> 01:15:29,955
That hurt!

1254
01:15:31,757 --> 01:15:34,026
And I'm not gonna do that,
I'm sorry.

1255
01:15:34,059 --> 01:15:35,861
What?

1256
01:15:35,895 --> 01:15:38,697
This is our day.

1257
01:15:38,731 --> 01:15:40,266
This was supposed to be
you and me.

1258
01:15:40,299 --> 01:15:42,768
What are you doing?

1259
01:15:42,801 --> 01:15:44,103
What are you doing?

1260
01:15:44,136 --> 01:15:46,338
How could you do this to me?

1261
01:15:46,372 --> 01:15:47,339
I did...

1262
01:15:47,373 --> 01:15:49,141
(sobbing)

1263
01:15:49,175 --> 01:15:52,178
I did everything for you.

1264
01:15:52,211 --> 01:15:54,914
This was all for you!

1265
01:15:54,947 --> 01:15:57,016
How could you do this
to me, Payton?

1266
01:15:57,049 --> 01:15:59,752
How could you do this to me?

1267
01:16:03,055 --> 01:16:05,391
(heavy breathing)

(sniffing)

1269
01:16:32,184 --> 01:16:42,127
(♪♪♪)

1270
01:16:47,299 --> 01:16:50,936
Now, one thing to remember,
Gregory,

1271
01:16:50,970 --> 01:16:54,807
is to always leave a good tip.

1272
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:56,809
You always say that.

1273
01:16:56,842 --> 01:16:58,310
(♪♪♪)

1274
01:16:58,344 --> 01:17:01,447
Well, when you gonna start
doing it?

1275
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:04,049
Don't you think it's time
maybe you get a job?

1276
01:17:04,083 --> 01:17:05,851
I'm only five.

1277
01:17:05,884 --> 01:17:09,255
(♪♪♪)

1278
01:17:09,288 --> 01:17:11,123
That's true, that's true.

1279
01:17:11,156 --> 01:17:13,158
(♪♪♪)

1280
01:17:13,192 --> 01:17:14,126
All right, well,
let's get going.

1281
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:16,295
I gotta take you back
to see your mama, okay?

1282
01:17:16,328 --> 01:17:17,363
Mhm.

1283
01:17:17,396 --> 01:17:18,931
All right.

1284
01:17:18,964 --> 01:17:21,233
(♪♪♪)

1285
01:17:21,267 --> 01:17:23,202
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1286
01:17:23,235 --> 01:17:25,204
(♪♪♪)

1287
01:17:25,237 --> 01:17:27,139
- Would you like a refill?
- Oh, no, I'm okay,

1288
01:17:27,172 --> 01:17:28,140
but thank you so much.

1289
01:17:28,173 --> 01:17:29,541
Thanks, Payton.
We'll see you again soon.

1290
01:17:29,575 --> 01:17:32,111
Okay, we'll see you.

1291
01:17:32,144 --> 01:17:33,312
Uh-oh.

1292
01:17:33,345 --> 01:17:34,580
What color?

1293
01:17:34,613 --> 01:17:36,115
Woo!

1294
01:17:36,148 --> 01:17:37,449
Blue.

1295
01:17:37,483 --> 01:17:47,426
