Oh, no, Becky,
they're right here, right now.

41
00:02:36,098 --> 00:02:37,866
It's something to do with, um,

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,835
with the OTB people,
they're here right now.

43
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:43,805
A motion picture company
is right in here, right now,

44
00:02:43,938 --> 00:02:46,875
and they're taking my photograph
right now as we speak.

45
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:49,445
That's why I can't talk
too long, sweetheart.

46
00:02:49,578 --> 00:02:51,480
No, it's something about...

47
00:02:51,614 --> 00:02:55,050
all the girls that Jackie
has assembled at one point,

48
00:02:55,184 --> 00:02:57,620
you know, with the big tushies
and everything, I don't know.

49
00:02:57,752 --> 00:02:59,488
Some kind of scandal
or something.

50
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:01,290
I know, I have to go.

51
00:03:01,423 --> 00:03:02,690
This might help,

52
00:03:02,824 --> 00:03:04,226
maybe they're going
to get 'em off.

53
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,430
[laughing]
Oh, oh, you're so funny.

54
00:03:09,165 --> 00:03:11,467
I don't think
it's anything like that, though.

55
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,569
I know my dear boy.

56
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:15,837
Okay, goodbye.

57
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,606
Tell Ted I said hello.

58
00:03:18,507 --> 00:03:21,743
Oh, you know, Becky,
is just full of herself.

59
00:03:21,876 --> 00:03:24,413
She's as excited
as I am about everything.

60
00:03:25,147 --> 00:03:27,782
She can talk up a storm,
you know.

61
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,252
Anyways,
get back to my sandwich, here.

62
00:03:30,386 --> 00:03:32,988
Look at that, this beautiful
sandwich that I made.

63
00:03:33,122 --> 00:03:35,790
Jackie used to love when
I made sandwiches like this.

64
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,328
You know, he used to have
girls over all the time

65
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:41,330
in his bedroom and stuff,

66
00:03:41,463 --> 00:03:43,365
and they would always
be practicing.

67
00:03:46,168 --> 00:03:48,703
I would hear them
practicing all night.

68
00:03:48,836 --> 00:03:51,173
You know, na-na, na-na,
things like that.

69
00:03:51,706 --> 00:03:53,942
And I'd go, Jackie,
your father's going to kill you

70
00:03:54,076 --> 00:03:55,810
if you mess up
those sheets again!

71
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:00,282
And then I would realize
his father's not coming home.

72
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,518
He went out
for a pack of cigarettes,

73
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:03,885
and never came back.

74
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,324
Anyways,
let me get myself a drink here.

75
00:04:09,391 --> 00:04:11,126
[sighing]

76
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,195
Oh, yes.

77
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,499
Let's go watch Pat Sajak,
shall we?

78
00:04:19,734 --> 00:04:21,136
[sniffing]

79
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:25,541
[man] <i>Jersey-born,
I knew I was destined for fame</i>

80
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:28,244
<i>and fortune
when at the age of seven,</i>

81
00:04:28,377 --> 00:04:30,246
<i>I won a local talent contest.</i>

82
00:04:30,778 --> 00:04:34,516
<i>I dropped the mic and started
shouting "zing, pow wow!"</i>

83
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:37,720
<i>And a star was born, babies.</i>

84
00:04:37,852 --> 00:04:39,887
<i>Ah, those friggin' birds.</i>

85
00:04:40,022 --> 00:04:42,157
<i>Oh, right, we need the birds</i>

86
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,493
<i>or we're not
a legit documentary.</i>

87
00:04:45,694 --> 00:04:49,598
Let me show you what he looked
like when he was on that show.

88
00:04:50,232 --> 00:04:54,069
Here he was, little Jackie. Oh.
[cooing]

89
00:04:54,203 --> 00:04:58,007
He used to poop himself a lot,
Jackie did.

90
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,409
I think it was
God's way of saying,

91
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:03,445
you need to pay attention
to your little son.

92
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:06,248
And I would rub
his little tush.

93
00:05:10,753 --> 00:05:12,521
Did you want any sandwich?

94
00:05:12,655 --> 00:05:14,089
And then here's,

95
00:05:14,223 --> 00:05:16,292
Jackie sent me this
from Las Vegas.

96
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:19,728
He's a lovely boy,
he always enjoyed...

97
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,131
sending me things
from far away.

98
00:05:22,264 --> 00:05:25,401
And then,
I'm so proud of this,

99
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,403
he got me an award.

100
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,438
I don't know what it's for
'cause the plaque,

101
00:05:29,571 --> 00:05:32,074
it came off of it
but he said, 'ma,

102
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,344
he used to call me 'ma,
you're a star in my book.

103
00:05:35,477 --> 00:05:38,414
And I used to cry a lot
about things like that.

104
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:42,917
This was the 70s,
Jackie was hot.

105
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:45,521
Buster Guy was the hot show.

106
00:05:45,654 --> 00:05:48,524
Jackie was doing live shows
five nights a week.

107
00:05:48,657 --> 00:05:52,494
I don't know where he found
the energy, but boy,

108
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:55,464
he had it
and there was this...

109
00:05:56,432 --> 00:05:59,934
this other kid, this new kid
who had his own act.

110
00:06:01,036 --> 00:06:02,304
It was really taking off.

111
00:06:02,438 --> 00:06:04,373
It was like this
Yakov Smirnoff thing.

112
00:06:04,506 --> 00:06:06,542
Like, he was talking about
how his country was different

113
00:06:06,675 --> 00:06:07,810
from our country.

114
00:06:07,942 --> 00:06:09,311
Total rip off,

115
00:06:09,445 --> 00:06:12,548
but it was the 80s,
so nobody cared. [laughs]

116
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:14,916
[Jackie] <i>I brought
the kid into the lights</i>

117
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,053
<i>and I was the only one
who saw more than just</i>

118
00:06:18,187 --> 00:06:21,123
<i>a little purple-coloured
rat squeaky toy.</i>

119
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:25,694
He met that Clackity-Cloackity,
whatever his name was,

120
00:06:25,828 --> 00:06:27,229
that little furry thing,

121
00:06:27,363 --> 00:06:29,231
I don't,
to this day, understand...

122
00:06:29,365 --> 00:06:30,999
[Jackie]
<i>Now, here's a secret.</i>

123
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:33,202
<i>Kitchity Katchity
ain't got no papers.</i>

124
00:06:33,335 --> 00:06:35,471
<i>He got in the U.S. of A.
by being a mule</i>

125
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,206
<i>for his cousin, Cudai.</i>

126
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:40,942
<i>Word is Kitchity owes Cudai
a buttload of cash,</i>

127
00:06:41,076 --> 00:06:43,312
<i>no pun intended.</i> [laughing]

128
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,614
You know,
they met at my table.

129
00:06:46,248 --> 00:06:48,250
When they first come here,
they didn't know a soul.

130
00:06:48,384 --> 00:06:49,917
Mostly,
they'd just sit around

131
00:06:50,052 --> 00:06:51,487
trying to cheat each other.

132
00:06:52,721 --> 00:06:54,189
Hey, the gang's all here.

133
00:06:54,323 --> 00:06:56,225
I don't believe it.

134
00:06:56,358 --> 00:06:58,160
You two old cronies
are still alive?

135
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,828
- Oh my.
- [all chuckling]

136
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,929
They just didn't
get along all the time.

137
00:07:02,064 --> 00:07:03,298
Liquor, drugs
and booze and women...

138
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:04,533
Women!

139
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,135
Yeah, that's what was
the problem.

140
00:07:06,268 --> 00:07:07,569
The women,
the booze, the drugs.

141
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:09,304
And then they'd fight over
the women.

142
00:07:09,438 --> 00:07:11,306
Yeah, right, but I think
they loved each other.

143
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,144
Kitchity Katchity became
the fan favorite breakout star

144
00:07:15,277 --> 00:07:17,045
for the TV show Buster Guy.

145
00:07:17,179 --> 00:07:18,647
After a pay dispute

146
00:07:18,781 --> 00:07:22,284
at the end of the first year
as a series regular,

147
00:07:22,418 --> 00:07:24,820
he moved out to L.A.
and we took him on.

148
00:07:24,952 --> 00:07:27,022
He went commercial, man.

149
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:29,191
He really wanted
your Uncle Tom on his back.

150
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:33,128
Uh, he... he left us.

151
00:07:33,262 --> 00:07:36,365
We knew he didn't have
the right temperament

152
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,934
for a kid show,
but we had the opportunity

153
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:43,372
to replace Ranger Rob
on his TV show,

154
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:48,010
and we jumped on it
and he made it work.

155
00:07:49,077 --> 00:07:50,945
The statistics don't lie.

156
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:53,081
Kids love purple.

157
00:07:53,215 --> 00:07:55,950
He was miserable,
artistically.

158
00:07:56,618 --> 00:07:59,455
Spending money
as fast as he was making it.

159
00:08:00,122 --> 00:08:02,957
And word of the drinking

160
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:05,127
and the life he was living

161
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,564
was being put out
for the public.

162
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:11,467
So... mid-season

163
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,969
we replaced him
with the YouTuber Poopy.

164
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:19,475
He said he was never going
to share the spotlight again.

00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,631
[groaning]

173
00:08:42,764 --> 00:08:45,200
[Jackie]
<i>I had created a monster.</i>

174
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:46,969
[Kitchity groaning]

175
00:08:47,102 --> 00:08:48,203
Aw, yes.

176
00:08:48,337 --> 00:08:52,541
[mocking laughter]

177
00:08:53,475 --> 00:08:56,378
He was so done
doing anything with kids.

178
00:08:56,512 --> 00:09:00,349
He hated kids.
They made him sick.

179
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,886
So he flew off to Vegas

180
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,489
and...
went to find Jackie for help.

181
00:09:08,891 --> 00:09:11,193
That's when he wrote...

182
00:09:11,326 --> 00:09:15,764
Bible School Sluts
from Outer Space.

183
00:09:16,832 --> 00:09:19,501
He wanted to show off
his acting chops.

184
00:09:19,635 --> 00:09:22,204
He wanted to reinvent himself

185
00:09:22,337 --> 00:09:25,307
and he needed to do
something big, something...

186
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,277
like... like
Ten Commandments big.

187
00:09:34,082 --> 00:09:35,551
Oh? Heavenly star command?

188
00:09:36,652 --> 00:09:38,053
Do you copy?

189
00:09:40,222 --> 00:09:43,358
Oh, no. Kitchi-poo!

190
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:46,395
[panting]

191
00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:49,965
You there, girl.
Get me off!

192
00:09:50,098 --> 00:09:51,533
No one would touch him.

193
00:09:52,234 --> 00:09:53,635
No one.

194
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,640
He was broke when that flopped.

195
00:09:59,274 --> 00:10:01,310
He said he wanted
to go to Vegas

196
00:10:01,443 --> 00:10:04,047
and "relive the glory days"?

197
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:07,482
He said he had to go
hook up with Jackie again.

198
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:12,321
Oh, he left me with nothing.

199
00:10:12,955 --> 00:10:15,223
He left me with this.

200
00:10:15,992 --> 00:10:17,259
"Dear sweetness,

201
00:10:17,392 --> 00:10:19,528
as you well know,
I've messed up.

202
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:23,365
Unfortunately, the only solution
is to leave L.A. forever."

203
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,069
[Kitchity] I'm behind
six months on the utilities.

204
00:10:26,201 --> 00:10:30,238
I owe the bank 50k and I also
owe Rizzo a thousand,

205
00:10:30,372 --> 00:10:33,042
and Kermit 500,
I think.

206
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,543
As you well know,

207
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,012
I didn't spend it
on other women,

208
00:10:36,144 --> 00:10:37,479
but on the horse races.

209
00:10:37,613 --> 00:10:39,748
Please,
kiss the Corvette for me.

210
00:10:39,881 --> 00:10:42,351
I'm behind
on the car payments, too.

211
00:10:42,484 --> 00:10:44,186
I also owe 800 to Elmo.

212
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:46,089
Careful, he's shady.

213
00:10:46,221 --> 00:10:47,923
"Sincerely,
your Kitchi-pie."

214
00:10:48,057 --> 00:10:49,958
[intriguing music]

215
00:10:50,093 --> 00:10:51,426
[man] <i>Hey, hey, hey, now.</i>

216
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,528
<i>You questioning
the validity of OTB?</i>

217
00:10:53,662 --> 00:10:57,132
<i>You haven't the audacity
to make judgment</i>

218
00:10:57,265 --> 00:11:00,669
<i>of the existence of the very
affliction that has crippled</i>

219
00:11:00,802 --> 00:11:03,305
<i>so many of my friends
and colleagues?</i>

220
00:11:03,438 --> 00:11:05,041
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

221
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:07,376
<i>You're just like
all the other lame brains.</i>

222
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:10,846
<i>I bet you'd even go
as far as to accuse me</i>

223
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,183
<i>and Kitchity Katchity
of making this OTB horror up.</i>

224
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:20,056
<i>Well, I'll have you know that
OTB is as real as it comes.</i>

225
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:24,359
<i>Because in broken knee caps,
lost wages, divorce,</i>

226
00:11:24,493 --> 00:11:27,195
<i>and even degenerative
degenerate syndrome,</i>

227
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:31,166
<i>like that which has attacked
my buddy Kitchity Katchity.</i>

228
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:34,070
<i>Yes, he, my friends,</i>

229
00:11:34,202 --> 00:11:38,173

[laughs]
<i>Yeah, you go Google that.</i>

231
00:11:44,513 --> 00:11:47,349
Oh, yeah. That's nice.

232
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,885

Oh, I love that so much
entertainment is in our blood.

238
00:12:05,034 --> 00:12:06,768
[laughing] Yes, it is.

<i>You see, some time
after I lost my show,</i>

247
00:12:34,063 --> 00:12:35,964
<i>and started running
out of money,</i>

248
00:12:36,099 --> 00:12:37,866
<i>I wasn't feeling so well.</i>

249
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,501
<i>I went to my doctor</i>

250
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,703
<i>and that's when he said
"unfortunately...</i>

251
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,540

- <i>Not the OTB.</i>
- [dramatic musical flourish]

255
00:12:55,017 --> 00:12:56,651
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

256
00:12:56,785 --> 00:12:58,854
<i>Is there anything that Jackie
can do for you, huh?</i>

257
00:12:58,988 --> 00:13:00,522
<i>Yes, there is, Jackie.</i>

258
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:05,260
<i>You see, medical research
has come a long way...</i>

259
00:13:05,393 --> 00:13:07,196
<i>but they need funding.</i>

260
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:08,897
<i>So I thought to myself,</i>

261
00:13:09,031 --> 00:13:12,434
<i>what can I do to bring
awareness to OTB?</i>

262
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:14,036
<i>And I said to myself,</i>

263
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,671
<i>you do what you do best,
old boy.</i>

264
00:13:16,805 --> 00:13:20,542

- <i>Yes. Yes!</i>

Hi, folks,
Jackie Fontaine here.

321
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:42,118
And did you know that 60 percent
of the 20 percent of the people

322
00:15:42,251 --> 00:15:45,087
you just saw are dealing
with the awful affliction

of OTB in their lives?

324
00:15:47,256 --> 00:15:50,825
But did you also know
that stars and celebrities

I don't blame people</i>

344
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:42,411
<i>for saying that, after all,</i>

345
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,646
<i>it was being held for free</i>

346
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:47,083
<i>at our old stomping grounds
at Casino.</i>

347
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:50,086
Yes, we hosted
the Miss OTB Pageant.

348
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:51,753
We couldn't be happier
about it.

349
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:55,757
Jackie and Kitchity
were like prodigal sons,

350
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,593
a family returned to home.
[chuckling]

351
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:01,696
[Jackie] <i>Of course, nothing
is for free in this world.</i>

352
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,100
<i>Even if it is
the casino stage,</i>

353
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,501
<i>a stage that we had
to share the rental</i>

354
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:10,805
<i>of between the local junior
high production of Our Town</i>

355
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:14,043
<i>and the Vegas Ladies
Quilting Awards Banquet.</i>

356
00:17:14,176 --> 00:17:17,046
[laughing] <i>Also,
it didn't hurt that</i>

357
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:21,083
<i>the casino was owned and built
by an ex-smalltime bookie</i>

358
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:23,651
<i>from the rough side
of the tracks of Milwaukee.</i>

359
00:17:23,785 --> 00:17:26,055
<i>Butch,
the bookie of [indistinct],</i>

360
00:17:26,188 --> 00:17:28,823
<i>an old friend of ours
who it was rumored</i>

361
00:17:28,957 --> 00:17:32,094
<i>had passed away recently
from OTB.</i>

362
00:17:32,794 --> 00:17:35,398
<i>Now his son, Butch
the bookie took over.</i>

363
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:38,467
<i>And of course,
the bookie junior, Butch,</i>

364
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,870
<i>didn't seem to fall
too far from the Kratch tree,</i>

365
00:17:42,004 --> 00:17:44,572
<i>if you know what I mean.</i>

366
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:47,609
<i>I'm Butch Snyder, junior,</i>

367
00:17:47,742 --> 00:17:50,212
<i>and I run this magical place,</i>

368
00:17:50,346 --> 00:17:53,748
<i>the Casino
in downtown Las Vegas.</i>

369
00:17:53,882 --> 00:17:56,751
<i>You know,
all casinos have lobbies,</i>

370
00:17:56,885 --> 00:18:01,090
<i>but at the Casino,
have we got a lobby!</i>

371
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:07,929
<i>You know, all casinos
and all hotels have rooms,</i>

372
00:18:08,064 --> 00:18:12,700
<i>but at the Casino,
have we got rooms!</i>

373
00:18:14,537 --> 00:18:19,607
<i>And, of course,
all casinos have restaurants.</i>

374
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:21,444
[clears throat]

375
00:18:21,576 --> 00:18:26,215
<i>But at the Casino?
Have we got a restaurants!</i>

376
00:18:27,782 --> 00:18:30,685
<i>Yes, there's no casino
in the world</i>

377
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:35,690
<i>like the Casino
in downtown Las Vegas.</i>

378
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:37,493
I was Jackie's
personal assistant

379
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,062
for about 20 plus
wonderful years.

380
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:42,131
He liked to praise
the go-for women.

381
00:18:42,264 --> 00:18:44,533
Go for this,
go for that he would say.

382
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:48,670
Oh... it was just like one of
those baby hairless monkeys

383
00:18:48,803 --> 00:18:50,939
you want to roll around
on the floor with.

384
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:53,042
Linoleum, I might add.

385
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:55,777
I used to clean his home
and did his laundry,

386
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,779
hand-washed.

387
00:18:57,912 --> 00:18:59,681
No, Jackie never paid me back.

388
00:18:59,814 --> 00:19:02,617
He owed me money. [sobbing]

389
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:09,924
Hey, guys, thanks for coming
down here and waiting for us.

390
00:19:10,925 --> 00:19:13,728
Our little deer here,
she's not much of a day person.

391
00:19:14,563 --> 00:19:17,533
Sometimes I wake up
and I don't know where I am.

392
00:19:17,665 --> 00:19:18,833
You I had to be there.

393
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:21,070
[laughing annoyingly]

394
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:25,474
Yeah, but this pageant,
it's been really good for us.

395
00:19:26,509 --> 00:19:29,078
Except for the fact that
it's being hosted at the Casino.

396
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:32,747
But I mean, our girl here
she's, you know,

397
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,583
she's got a schedule
to keep now

398
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:37,153
and goals to strive and aim for.

399
00:19:37,286 --> 00:19:39,221
And she's meeting
a lot of new people.

400
00:19:39,355 --> 00:19:41,457
So I think
it's been really good for her.

401
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,926
- [sulty music]
- [crowd cheering]

402
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:55,337
Whoa.

403
00:19:55,471 --> 00:19:59,074
[cheering and whistling]

404
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,313
Oh, oh.

405
00:20:13,122 --> 00:20:15,291
I just love my life
as a dancer.

406
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:18,160
I've met some really
interesting people.

407
00:20:18,294 --> 00:20:20,563
And I've learned
a whole lot about myself.

408
00:20:20,695 --> 00:20:23,865
Yep, I just love it
when I learn important stuff,

409
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:26,768
all by accident.
[off-putting laugh]

410
00:20:27,403 --> 00:20:29,505
I never thought
I'd be in a pageant.

411
00:20:29,638 --> 00:20:32,675
So I wanted, I thought
it'd be a good idea to use it

412
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:35,211
as a platform to promote
my charity idea I came up with.

413
00:20:35,344 --> 00:20:38,581
We are a family
with standards, you see.

414
00:20:38,713 --> 00:20:40,882
And, um, as...

415
00:20:41,016 --> 00:20:42,717
And as a, as a charity...

416
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,286
- Mom...
- Give that to me.

417
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,688
Just going to show it.

418
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,489
As charity minded...

419
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:49,857
as charity minded people,

420
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:53,962
I just want to...
I just want to help people

421
00:20:54,096 --> 00:20:55,497
who are in difficult times.

422
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,066
So the... resource

423
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:58,701
that I came up with
for my charity is...

424
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,169
Charity.

425
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,671
Our family
has an obligation.

426
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:05,708
And if that involves
a noble charity,

427
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,809
well then I say, so be it.

428
00:21:07,942 --> 00:21:10,346
You know, I had actually
never even heard

429
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:15,251
of this Jackie Fountain before
or this itchy fellow.

430
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:17,785
His name is Kit Kat.

431
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,422
And, but I want to know because

432
00:21:20,556 --> 00:21:23,058
I wasn't allowed to watch
anything on TV where...

433
00:21:23,192 --> 00:21:26,195
Again,
we're a charity minded people.

434
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:30,099
And we are often blinded
by good intentions.

435
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,102
Oh, bullshit.

436
00:21:33,801 --> 00:21:35,638
Yeah, right.

437
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,506
Because you said
colleges for fools

438
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,708
and IT schools are scams.

439
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:41,176
All the commercials
late at night.

440
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:46,348
We'll have no talk
of trade schools on film.

441
00:21:46,482 --> 00:21:47,782
Young lady.

442
00:21:49,084 --> 00:21:51,120
So tell everyone then.

443
00:21:51,953 --> 00:21:54,223
Why is it such a crime
to work with your hands?

444
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:56,525
[giggling]

445
00:21:56,659 --> 00:21:58,893
Out of the mouths of babes.

446
00:21:59,028 --> 00:22:00,996
I blame this on her father.

447
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,465
Ugh, that Castilian
blood of yours

448
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:05,434
makes her say
the darndest things.

449
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:07,636
You say the darnedest thing,
do you.

450
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,238
- [cooing]
- Ew!

451
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:11,006
Don't make out with me on TV.

452
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,907
- [laughing] Make out.
- Stop it.

453
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:16,478
Oh, pretty.
[sighing in satisfaction]

454
00:22:19,348 --> 00:22:21,517
So I know you didn't get
to see it that well earlier,

455
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:26,488
but it says, ask me about OTB
and it has the guys on here

456
00:22:26,622 --> 00:22:29,591
and then, um, I research like,
what areas of the world...

457
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:31,760
That is lovely, dear.

458
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:34,862
Like I said,
charity minded.

459
00:22:34,997 --> 00:22:36,265
[Britney yelping]

460
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:39,967
Come this way. [chuckling]

461
00:22:40,102 --> 00:22:43,706
These are my prized possessions.

462
00:22:43,838 --> 00:22:45,074
Besides Britney, of course.

463
00:22:45,207 --> 00:22:46,775
Are you alright, honey?

464
00:22:47,376 --> 00:22:50,579
Here is my Lovely Eyes sash.

465
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:55,150
And here,
I won for bowling night queen.

466
00:22:55,284 --> 00:22:57,019
<i>♪ Gonna score tonight! ♪</i>

467
00:22:57,653 --> 00:23:00,456
And over here is,
we don't talk about that one.

468
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:02,890
And this is
healthy living queen.

469
00:23:03,025 --> 00:23:05,027
Still working on that.
[laughing]

470
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,863
And here
is my piece de resistance.

471
00:23:10,132 --> 00:23:12,934
Miss Nevada Supreème.

472
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:15,838
Nineteen-eighty...

473
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,373
Whoa, oh, look here!

474
00:23:17,506 --> 00:23:20,609
Here I am on my wedding day.
[laughs]

475
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:26,415
As you may know,
Mr. Tehran is no longer with us.

476
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:30,786
Oh look,
we were so in love.

477
00:23:30,918 --> 00:23:32,821
Our love was almost,

478
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:34,889
almost too much.

479
00:23:35,023 --> 00:23:37,059
The highs were so high.

480
00:23:37,826 --> 00:23:40,162
It was... intense.

481
00:23:41,096 --> 00:23:42,831
It was almost abnormal.

482
00:23:43,432 --> 00:23:46,668
Yes, it was, um...
it was so intense that I...

483
00:23:49,204 --> 00:23:50,606
I had him deported.

484
00:23:52,508 --> 00:23:56,311
I can't say that it was easy
being a single mother alone,

485
00:23:56,445 --> 00:23:59,882
raising a young daughter,
but rest assured friends...

486
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:02,651
my little girl
will grow up to know...

487
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:06,255
the most important thing
in this life...

488
00:24:06,388 --> 00:24:08,657
is being a beautiful woman.

489
00:24:11,527 --> 00:24:15,264
You all look so pretty,
it's a little intimidating.

490
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:19,334
What are you,
some kind of lesbian, bag lady?

491
00:24:19,468 --> 00:24:21,370
[laughing]

492
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:25,407
Oh, oh, no.
I mistaken for that a lot.

493
00:24:26,775 --> 00:24:28,877
I... This is for charity.

494
00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:31,013
Yeah. Charity's
what got you the dog.

495
00:24:31,146 --> 00:24:33,015
Oh, snap!

496
00:24:34,082 --> 00:24:36,585
[sighs]

497
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:39,954
Shh!

498
00:24:42,391 --> 00:24:44,393
Thank you all for coming
and trying out

499
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:47,496
for the first ever
pageant to benefit OTB.

500
00:24:48,263 --> 00:24:50,232
I'm Toby and I'll be
your coach for the run

501
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:53,202
of this magical experience

502
00:24:53,335 --> 00:24:55,204
that will change
your life forever.

503
00:24:56,171 --> 00:24:57,773
Now...

504
00:24:57,906 --> 00:25:00,776
please let me introduce you
to our co-founder

505
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:04,279
and local Las Vegas icon,

506
00:25:04,413 --> 00:25:06,081
Mr. Jackie Fountain.

507
00:25:06,582 --> 00:25:10,452
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Yeah, hello! Holy.

508
00:25:10,586 --> 00:25:12,020
Yeah, I just flew in
from Jersey.

509
00:25:12,154 --> 00:25:14,289
My you-know-
what's hurting.

510
00:25:14,423 --> 00:25:16,725
Hey, welcome, ladies
to the first annual

511
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:19,161
OTB Beauty Pageant
Cavalcade of Celebrity

512
00:25:19,294 --> 00:25:20,829
Super Spotlights Glued
to the Truth.

513
00:25:20,963 --> 00:25:22,931
And you're,
you right now

514
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:25,300
are meeting the host
with the most.

515
00:25:25,434 --> 00:25:27,035
Or maybe you ladies

516
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:28,937
are going to be the most
with the moist.

517
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:30,339
[laughing]

518
00:25:30,472 --> 00:25:32,374
I kid, I kid. Yeah, you know.

519
00:25:32,508 --> 00:25:35,410
But anyways, you're all
going to make history tonight.

520
00:25:35,544 --> 00:25:38,313
Maybe a hysterectomy.
[laughing]

521
00:25:38,447 --> 00:25:41,617
See that joke, stick that
right in there in-studio.

522
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,653
[applauding]

523
00:25:44,786 --> 00:25:47,022
Oh, oh.

524
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,660
Oh.

525
00:25:52,194 --> 00:25:54,229
- Really?
- [crumpling]

526
00:26:01,069 --> 00:26:02,337
[tense music]

527
00:26:02,471 --> 00:26:04,606
And where do you think
you're going?

528
00:26:05,307 --> 00:26:08,510
This is Miss Kelly,
personal trainer.

529
00:26:09,211 --> 00:26:11,213
I see why you called me here.

530
00:26:11,346 --> 00:26:14,349
We have a lot of work
ahead of us.

531
00:26:15,183 --> 00:26:16,552
What?

532
00:26:16,685 --> 00:26:18,220
Mom, I don't have time.
I'm going to work.

533
00:26:18,353 --> 00:26:20,355
- I'm going...
- There will be no work

534
00:26:20,489 --> 00:26:22,558
in this house, young lady.

535
00:26:23,725 --> 00:26:24,893
Come on, you...

536
00:26:25,028 --> 00:26:28,163
And what... is this?

537
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:30,632
- That's my ukulele.
- [stumming]

538
00:26:30,766 --> 00:26:32,167
I've been...

539
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:33,569
You thought
you were going to play this

540
00:26:33,702 --> 00:26:35,370
in the talent portion,
didn't you?

541
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:38,840
- Well...
- Didn't you?

542
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:42,110
- Yes?
- Let me guess,

543
00:26:42,244 --> 00:26:44,047
this is one of those
it's so lame

544
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:46,081
that it's hip things, right?

545
00:26:48,216 --> 00:26:50,385
Ugh, do you guys not get it,
you don't get the irony that...

546
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:53,855
Typical hipsters,
bacon diet with no definition.

547
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,457
- So sad.
- What?

548
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:00,063
Oh my, please.

549
00:27:00,195 --> 00:27:02,397
Mom, no. No!

550
00:27:02,531 --> 00:27:04,700
Let's get one thing straight.

551
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:08,037
Miss Kelly has agreed
to work with you on the side

552
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,073
and help mold you
into image

553
00:27:10,205 --> 00:27:12,240
of a perfect
pageant goddess.

554
00:27:12,374 --> 00:27:16,378
And there is no room
for ironic hipster garbage!

555
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:18,413
Mom, what are we going to do
about the talents?

556
00:27:18,547 --> 00:27:20,248
What are we going to do now?

557
00:27:20,382 --> 00:27:23,585
What all sexy and sophisticated
young women do.

558
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,788
Modern dance.

559
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:33,862
[funky music picks up]

560
00:27:39,468 --> 00:27:42,771
[indistinct chatter]

561
00:27:43,505 --> 00:27:45,874
- Thank you, yeah.
- [chattering]

562
00:28:06,762 --> 00:28:09,431
Will you excuse me,
just a minute please?

563
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:10,766
Thanks.

564
00:28:14,336 --> 00:28:15,704
[gasping]

565
00:28:16,471 --> 00:28:17,906
There is something
really special

566
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:19,741
about that girl right there.

567
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,612
[exhales]

568
00:28:39,128 --> 00:28:40,862
Watch and learn.

569
00:28:56,211 --> 00:28:57,345
Oh.

570
00:28:57,479 --> 00:28:59,281
Excuse me.

571
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:12,028
It's just a little something
I carry with me when I cry.

572
00:29:12,161 --> 00:29:15,497
[indistinct chatter]

573
00:29:16,132 --> 00:29:17,499
So...

574
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:19,367
Oh, yeah, yeah.

575
00:29:19,501 --> 00:29:21,070
You're pushing
the buttons there, Cece.

576
00:29:21,204 --> 00:29:23,371
You are a big button pusher.

577
00:29:23,505 --> 00:29:25,607
I don't know about big.

578
00:29:25,741 --> 00:29:28,243
Oh, yeah. No, no, no.
You're alright...

579
00:29:28,376 --> 00:29:31,813
Yeah, I was seeing
Kitchity on the side.

580
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:35,751
What of it?

581
00:29:37,486 --> 00:29:39,788
And let me tell you,
that little purple guy...

582
00:29:40,922 --> 00:29:42,691
who knows
how to please a woman.

583
00:29:43,425 --> 00:29:44,860
That little purple fur,

584
00:29:44,994 --> 00:29:47,395
he knows how to hit
all the right spots.

585
00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:51,566
That's something that Jackie,
could never do.

586
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,901
Mm.

587
00:29:53,035 --> 00:29:54,369
[Jackie] <i>Ah, bugger.</i>

588
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:56,072
<i>How could I let
my animal magnetism</i>

589
00:29:56,205 --> 00:29:57,639
<i>take over like that?</i>

590
00:29:57,773 --> 00:29:59,808
<i>How was I to know
that my love making</i>

591
00:29:59,941 --> 00:30:03,278
<i>would start the shit storm
of the century?</i>

592
00:30:03,411 --> 00:30:04,913
<i>Little did I know</i>

593
00:30:05,047 --> 00:30:07,549
<i>that this was the start
of my own undoing.</i>

594
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:10,019
<i>This was all
that purple little swifter</i>

595
00:30:10,153 --> 00:30:12,954
<i>needed in order
to put his plan into action.</i>

596
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:16,192
<i>He knew I would have
her plums up.</i>

597
00:30:16,324 --> 00:30:19,961
<i>And he knew I would be too busy
wheeling and dealing.</i>

598
00:30:20,096 --> 00:30:23,465
<i>He knew my musk, Man Breeze,
available at all drugstores</i>

599
00:30:23,598 --> 00:30:26,601
<i>for 29.99,
would fill the air</i>

600
00:30:26,735 --> 00:30:29,805
<i>with animalistic urges
and innuendos.</i>

601
00:30:29,938 --> 00:30:33,375
<i>I had her sexy long legs
with those black, new,</i>

602
00:30:33,508 --> 00:30:37,612
<i>whoa, stilettos from Kmart
shaking in the nether regions.</i>

603
00:30:37,746 --> 00:30:39,282
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

604
00:30:39,414 --> 00:30:42,018
<i>We all know that if you play
where your shit,</i>

605
00:30:42,151 --> 00:30:44,853
<i>you end up with a sandbox
full of turds.</i>

606
00:30:44,987 --> 00:30:46,289
<i>Oh baby.</i>

607
00:30:47,123 --> 00:30:50,392
<i>So why didn't I exercise
a little self-control?</i>

608
00:30:51,127 --> 00:30:55,931
<i>Why couldn't I see that Cece,
an amazing dreamboat of a woman,</i>

609
00:30:56,065 --> 00:30:59,068
<i>was after more
than just Jackie's manhood?</i>

610
00:30:59,935 --> 00:31:02,838
Psst! Camera boy, come here.
Come in here.

611
00:31:04,372 --> 00:31:06,541
Shh...

612
00:31:08,543 --> 00:31:10,679
Call it a mother's intuition,

613
00:31:10,812 --> 00:31:13,515
but there is something
not quite right here,

614
00:31:13,648 --> 00:31:16,152
and I am going to find out
what it is.

615
00:31:17,086 --> 00:31:19,721
[banging] Pipe down over there,
we're having a meeting.

616
00:31:19,855 --> 00:31:23,425
...cell phone backstage,
blowing up my stage. Okay.

617
00:31:24,459 --> 00:31:25,760
Britney!

618
00:31:25,894 --> 00:31:27,863
Honey,
you just look so fabulous.

619
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,366
Oh, I'm so nervous I think
I'm going to throw up.

620
00:31:31,499 --> 00:31:32,968
That just means
you're ready for office.

621
00:31:33,102 --> 00:31:34,836
But I tell you what,
if you need to do that,

622
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:37,405
go find the trash can,
okay sugar? Alright.

623
00:31:39,741 --> 00:31:42,477
Okay, girls,
it's about go to time.

624
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:44,379
Now, remember,
this is for charity,

625
00:31:44,512 --> 00:31:46,381
so suck 'em in
and stick 'em out.

626
00:31:47,149 --> 00:31:50,119
Where is that purple little rat?
When I get my hands on him...

627
00:31:50,253 --> 00:31:51,820
Who died
and made you Grand Puba?

628
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:53,655
Oh, well, speaking of Puba
How about this, queen?

629
00:31:53,788 --> 00:31:55,358
I had to discover
you and Kitchity

630
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,791
in the smut magazines, huh?

631
00:31:56,925 --> 00:31:58,493
What a girl
can't have a good time?

632
00:31:58,627 --> 00:32:00,428
- Oh, when I get my hands...
- [slapping]

633
00:32:00,562 --> 00:32:01,696
...on him.

634
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,398
Oh, I bet
you're nesting in there.

635
00:32:03,531 --> 00:32:04,599
You come out, right now.

636
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:06,401
- [slapping]
- Oh!

637
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:08,837
You've lost your mind.

638
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,605
Oh, I've lost my,
oh there you are.

639
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,975
Look at that perfect little
hideout right there, huh?

640
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,978
You come out right now
and face me like...

641
00:32:16,112 --> 00:32:19,581
[groaning & moaning]

642
00:32:24,387 --> 00:32:26,355
[pained cries]

643
00:32:27,123 --> 00:32:29,858
Where are you?
You're going to pay for this.

644
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:33,662
Jackie, you fuck...- giddy.

645
00:32:35,331 --> 00:32:38,466
You are going to get up
out of that chair like a man

646
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,202
and face me like a man,

647
00:32:40,336 --> 00:32:41,803
you little purple rag-wearing,

648
00:32:41,937 --> 00:32:44,006
gypsy cab driving,
son of a...

649
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,841
Oh, yeah, you piece of coal,
your white sheets are showing.

650
00:32:46,975 --> 00:32:48,777
What are you doing
with my Elaine, huh?

651
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:50,745
- [Elaine] Whoa, time out!
- You stay out of this.

652
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:52,614
Hey, at least someone around
here can still lay some pipe.

653
00:32:52,747 --> 00:32:54,083
Who? Your little pecker?

654
00:32:54,216 --> 00:32:55,717
You look like
the grimace of scot creek.

655
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,019
You look like a hate crime.

656
00:32:57,153 --> 00:32:58,620
You were nothing
but backup talent.

657
00:32:58,753 --> 00:33:00,755
No matter
how much you paid that lady,

658
00:33:00,889 --> 00:33:02,224
- that wig always looks fake.
- Oh, really?

659
00:33:02,358 --> 00:33:04,492
Well, I'll tell you,
you're a tough guy, huh?

660
00:33:04,626 --> 00:33:06,162
What do you think
about this, huh?

661
00:33:06,295 --> 00:33:08,297
- Yeah. Yeah, you like that?
- Stop it, I'm...

662
00:33:08,431 --> 00:33:10,166
I'm going to keep pushing it.

663
00:33:10,299 --> 00:33:13,035
[indistinct yelling]

664
00:33:13,169 --> 00:33:16,005
That's it, Jackie.
You get out of here.

665
00:33:16,138 --> 00:33:18,441
I swear if you screw up
this gig for me tonight,

666
00:33:18,573 --> 00:33:21,143
a wire brush
your saggy old man balls

667
00:33:21,277 --> 00:33:23,145
until you drop your Depends.

668
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,646
Do you get me, Fontaine?

669
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:26,948
Oh, you don't
talk to me that way.

670
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,750
Next wife,
or no one's wife.

671
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:32,620
You're a has-been, Fontaine.
Now and forevermore.

672
00:33:32,754 --> 00:33:34,656
I'm just getting started.
You understand?

673
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:37,892
You little purple
piece of crap, huh?

674
00:33:40,795 --> 00:33:42,831
[pages flapping]

675
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,170
[paper crinkling]

676
00:33:57,346 --> 00:33:59,982
So I'm, I'm really nervous.

677
00:34:00,116 --> 00:34:01,484
What about you?

678
00:34:01,616 --> 00:34:03,252
I don't get nervous.

679
00:34:03,386 --> 00:34:05,287
- I'm a dancer.
- Really?

680
00:34:05,421 --> 00:34:06,921
You don't get nervous?

681
00:34:07,555 --> 00:34:09,992
Look, this is my me-time
before the show.

682
00:34:10,126 --> 00:34:11,926
If you're looking
to make friends,

683
00:34:12,061 --> 00:34:14,963
why don't you take
your little lesbian dyke bag

684
00:34:15,097 --> 00:34:17,266
and your hairy little legs
and go down the street,

685
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,867
try the local dyke bar.

686
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:22,904
I'll even give you a topic,
power tools.

687
00:34:24,407 --> 00:34:26,975
No, I don't know
what your problem is with me,

688
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:29,744
but I've been really nice
to you and everyone here.

689
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:32,781
I mean,
we're here for charity.

690
00:34:32,914 --> 00:34:35,950
Reality check, honey.
I don't do charity.

691
00:34:36,085 --> 00:34:39,088
Butch, the bookie junior,
owns the Casino,

692
00:34:39,221 --> 00:34:41,991
and he made a deal
with Jackie and K.K.

693
00:34:42,124 --> 00:34:44,193
and all of Vegas
for this pageant.

694
00:34:44,326 --> 00:34:46,462
So, you see, I can't lose.

695
00:34:46,594 --> 00:34:49,065
So you see, this pageant

696
00:34:49,198 --> 00:34:52,134
isn't really about
charity, losers.

697
00:34:52,268 --> 00:34:55,371
It's about winners.
And that would be me.

698
00:34:55,504 --> 00:34:56,771
[all giggling]

699
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:59,241
You think I can't do this?

700
00:34:59,941 --> 00:35:03,112
Think again, because I can,
and I'm going to show you.

701
00:35:03,546 --> 00:35:05,147
I'll show all of you.

702
00:35:05,281 --> 00:35:08,184
Then you may want to shave
your upper lip, tuts.

703
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:10,119
[faux laughter]

704
00:35:11,686 --> 00:35:14,789
Ha, ha-ha, ha,
Ha-ha-ha...

705
00:35:15,257 --> 00:35:17,193
You all think
I can't do this?

706
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:18,693
Well I can.

707
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:20,795
I'm going to show you all.

708
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,266
[sobbing]

709
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,902
- Hey, what's wrong?
- [sobbing continues]

710
00:35:35,643 --> 00:35:38,080
Look what they did to you.

711
00:35:40,316 --> 00:35:42,784
[objects clattering]

712
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:46,288
This is it.

713
00:35:49,492 --> 00:35:51,793
Oh. Hello, Jackie.

714
00:35:53,095 --> 00:35:54,963
I was just looking for
something.

715
00:35:55,097 --> 00:35:56,965
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

716
00:35:57,765 --> 00:35:59,301
What'd you lose?

717
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:04,106
I was looking for a... condom.

718
00:36:06,342 --> 00:36:07,543
Really?

719
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:12,248
I thought maybe we could...
find a use for it.

720
00:36:13,815 --> 00:36:15,417
Call me Mrs. Robinson.

721
00:36:16,986 --> 00:36:20,755

00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:22,458
Coo-coo-cachoo.

723
00:36:22,591 --> 00:36:23,858
I'm what needs getting done.

724
00:36:23,993 --> 00:36:25,594
I bet you do.

725
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:27,396
Let me tell you something, baby.

726
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,830
Oh.

727
00:36:28,963 --> 00:36:30,798
You're going to take
a Jackie ride.

728
00:36:30,932 --> 00:36:32,268
Oh, there you go.

729
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:33,701
It's a neat ticket.

730
00:36:33,835 --> 00:36:35,703
- Oh, all the way.
- Oh. Alright, Jackie.

731
00:36:35,837 --> 00:36:37,439
Alright, Jackie.

732
00:36:37,573 --> 00:36:39,074
Oh, but first, but first...

733
00:36:41,277 --> 00:36:43,479
Let me prepare
the mood for you.

734
00:36:43,612 --> 00:36:45,648
Okay, come on.

735
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,318
Yeah touch me.
There you go.

- Oh dear.
- Oh, okay.

737
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,155
Let me, let me prepare
something, okay?

738
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:54,889
- Alright.
- Yes, Jackie. Prepare.

739
00:36:55,024 --> 00:36:56,292
Come with me.

740
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:58,227
I know you've been
waiting for this.

741
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,830
You know you want it.
Let's put some music on first.

- [Jackie] "Oh, my God?"
- [Cece] That wasn't me.

- No.

this is not what it looks like.

No, not at all.
I was not...

766
00:37:54,383 --> 00:37:57,419
I was teaching
that snatch a lesson.

- I was...
- What?

768
00:37:59,188 --> 00:38:01,756
- Shut up, you little man.
- You don't have to...

I think I'm going
to be sick.

770
00:38:03,993 --> 00:38:06,629
No, not in here.
This is brand new carpet I got.

No, no, no, no.

772
00:38:10,633 --> 00:38:15,571
Now look, okay, that's it.
No more dance moves.

773
00:38:15,704 --> 00:38:17,139
Mom, you're sick in the head.

774
00:38:17,273 --> 00:38:18,674
[Cece] No,
I did it all for you.

Mom, the 60s are over.

Britney, are you okay?

779
00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:37,026
I've been better, though.

780
00:38:37,726 --> 00:38:39,094
Huh?

781
00:38:39,794 --> 00:38:41,263
That was sarcasm.

00:38:41,397 --> 00:38:42,830
Oh. [chuckles]

00:38:42,964 --> 00:38:45,534

I got somebody here

784
00:38:45,668 --> 00:38:46,868
that wants to talk to you.

Oh, I bet they do.

00:38:49,937 --> 00:38:51,073
Oh?

787
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:52,708
That was, that was sarcasm.

788
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,377
Oh, right. I'm learning.

789
00:38:55,511 --> 00:38:58,514
Okay, so someone
wants to thank you

790
00:38:58,647 --> 00:39:00,416
for all your hard work.

791
00:39:01,183 --> 00:39:02,850
What? Who wants what?

792
00:39:03,419 --> 00:39:06,355
Go on, Ruby.
Tell her what you told me.

793
00:39:07,855 --> 00:39:09,857
Well, the other day,
I was over at Jackie's house

794
00:39:09,992 --> 00:39:11,859
doing yard work,
as he asked me to,

795
00:39:11,994 --> 00:39:14,829
when I gota touch of the heat
stroke and fell into the pool,

796
00:39:14,962 --> 00:39:17,232
but luckily
I had one of your bags,

797
00:39:17,366 --> 00:39:19,101
which I used
as a flotation device.

798
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:21,869
Oh, I screamed
for hours and hours,

799
00:39:22,004 --> 00:39:23,439
but no one could hear me.

800
00:39:23,572 --> 00:39:25,674
I think Jackie
had the television on too long.

801
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:27,743
If it wasn't
for the ramen noodles

802
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:30,346
in the water purifier again,
I would have surely drowned.

803
00:39:30,479 --> 00:39:33,615
Oh, are you okay?
Hope you're okay?

804
00:39:33,749 --> 00:39:35,017
I think so.

805
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,752
After I got
a bit of strength back,

806
00:39:36,884 --> 00:39:40,656
I kicked my legs like one
of the Rockets and made it out.

807
00:39:41,156 --> 00:39:44,693
You saved my life.
You and your wonderful bags.

808
00:39:44,827 --> 00:39:46,462
Oh, my gosh.

809
00:39:46,595 --> 00:39:49,365
Oh, my gosh. Wow.

810
00:39:49,498 --> 00:39:52,835
Well, I'll leave you
two kids alone now.

811
00:39:52,967 --> 00:39:54,136
Time for me to go take

812
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:56,004
a delicious bowel movement.

813
00:39:56,638 --> 00:39:57,706
Good luck, Rube.

814
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,308
Oh my gosh.

815
00:40:00,476 --> 00:40:03,045
Thanks for reminding me why,
why I got into this pageant

816
00:40:03,178 --> 00:40:04,646
in the first place.

817
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,015
Well, that's not all.

818
00:40:13,722 --> 00:40:16,658
Thank you. Oh, I mean,

819
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:20,496
thanks for this and for, um,
for bringing me home.

820
00:40:20,629 --> 00:40:22,564
Well, I thought someone

821
00:40:22,698 --> 00:40:26,535
might have forgotten about
their most beautiful feature.

822
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,037
Uh, my God, their boobs?

823
00:40:29,571 --> 00:40:31,573
No, their heart.

824
00:40:31,707 --> 00:40:33,975
Oh. [laughing]

825
00:40:37,446 --> 00:40:38,447
You play?

826
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,816
Oh, yeah.
I mean I played a little.

827
00:40:40,948 --> 00:40:42,618
Mostly I play guitar.

828
00:40:42,751 --> 00:40:45,087
But you work for that
Kitchity OTB creep.

829
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,656
I don't... You don't
look like L.A. trash.

830
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,324
What's your deal?

831
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:52,594
Well, first of all,
thank you for the compliment.

832
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:56,131
And second...
that's a good question.

833
00:40:56,265 --> 00:40:59,001
I mean,
I was an intern on his show,

834
00:40:59,134 --> 00:41:00,469
when he had a show,

835
00:41:00,602 --> 00:41:02,937
and you could say,
I work for him,

836
00:41:03,071 --> 00:41:04,706
but mostly I'm an actor.

837
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,776
That takes a lot of guts
to move out to L.A. and...

838
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,344
There's nothing more gratifying

839
00:41:09,478 --> 00:41:11,246
than filling the world's
hearts with joy.

840
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,515
I know I'm not
a big star or anything,

841
00:41:13,649 --> 00:41:15,751
and I probably never
will be one, but...

842
00:41:15,884 --> 00:41:17,419
[sighing]

843
00:41:17,553 --> 00:41:19,721
I got into this game
to fill those hearts with joy,

844
00:41:19,855 --> 00:41:23,425
and if I have to prop up
a glutton and drunk to do it,

845
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:24,893
then so be it.

846
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:26,462
I mean... I'm sure

847
00:41:26,595 --> 00:41:28,464
one day your dream
will come true and,

848
00:41:28,597 --> 00:41:29,998
and when it does,

849
00:41:30,132 --> 00:41:31,934
people will fall in love
with the real thing.

850
00:41:32,067 --> 00:41:33,502

876

880
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,548
[laughing connivingly]

881
00:43:26,682 --> 00:43:28,951
Hello, I'm here
with Butch Junior,

882
00:43:29,084 --> 00:43:30,652
owner of this fine
Nevada casino

883
00:43:30,786 --> 00:43:33,455
nestled in the heart
of the Las Vegas Strip.

884
00:43:33,589 --> 00:43:35,424
Thanks for joining us tonight,
Butch Jr.

885
00:43:35,557 --> 00:43:37,326
Thank you so much.
And you know what?

886
00:43:37,459 --> 00:43:39,461
I'm really glad that you said
that we are in the heart

887
00:43:39,595 --> 00:43:41,964
of the Las Vegas Strip
because we here at the Casino,

888
00:43:42,097 --> 00:43:43,532
we're all about heart.

889
00:43:43,665 --> 00:43:45,567
Some folks at home,
they might think that

890
00:43:45,701 --> 00:43:48,203
we in the casino business
are responsible for OTB,

891
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:50,006
but I'm here to tell you and all
of them

892
00:43:50,138 --> 00:43:51,740
that is simply not true.

893
00:43:51,873 --> 00:43:55,811
In fact, this evening,
I am going to donate $50,000.

894
00:43:55,944 --> 00:43:59,015
So not only good looking,
but also a giver as well.

895
00:43:59,147 --> 00:44:00,315
Well, we appreciate that.

896
00:44:00,449 --> 00:44:02,718
Oh, thank you.
You are too kind.

897
00:44:02,851 --> 00:44:04,653
[speaking quietly]

898
00:44:04,786 --> 00:44:06,421
Hey! Zing pow wow!

899
00:44:06,555 --> 00:44:08,690
I bet you have some
papaerwork to do.

900
00:44:08,824 --> 00:44:10,559
Hey, zing pow wow.
How you doing?

901
00:44:10,692 --> 00:44:12,427
Good Jackie, good to see you.

902
00:44:12,561 --> 00:44:16,398
It's a man of the hour,
Mr. Jackie Fontaine himself.

903
00:44:16,531 --> 00:44:18,433
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Yes, it is.

904
00:44:18,567 --> 00:44:22,105
Nobody can fill up a casino
like my buddy Butch, here.

905
00:44:22,237 --> 00:44:24,172
- Well, we do aim to please.
- Oh, yeah.

906
00:44:24,306 --> 00:44:25,941
Hey, speaking of aiming,
why don't you learn

907
00:44:26,075 --> 00:44:28,111
how to aim a little better
when you're in the men's room?

908
00:44:28,243 --> 00:44:30,013
- I look at my shoes. [laughing]
- Oh.

909
00:44:30,145 --> 00:44:31,580
- Made you look!
- This guy...

910
00:44:31,713 --> 00:44:33,382
You stepped right into that.

911
00:44:33,515 --> 00:44:35,851
But seriously, folks, I kid.
I kid all the time.

912
00:44:35,985 --> 00:44:38,121
We're just trying to kind of
clear up a few things.

913
00:44:38,253 --> 00:44:39,521
I'm just trying
to get an interview

914
00:44:39,655 --> 00:44:41,256
- with Kitchity Katchity tonight.
- Yes.

915
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:43,026
You know, we want to hear
a little bit more

916
00:44:43,158 --> 00:44:44,493
about his condition,

917
00:44:44,626 --> 00:44:46,395
about the response
from the community.

918
00:44:46,528 --> 00:44:48,897
We also want to know
where the proceeds are being,

919
00:44:49,032 --> 00:44:50,565
where they're being utilized.

920
00:44:50,699 --> 00:44:52,234
Oh, of course, yeah,
everybody wants to know that.

921
00:44:52,367 --> 00:44:53,969
And the community.
We love the community.

922
00:44:54,103 --> 00:44:55,737
Thank you, community. Yeah.

923
00:44:55,871 --> 00:44:58,273
You know, I've been trying
to get a hold of the OTB people

924
00:44:58,407 --> 00:45:00,509
'cause we need to know
how to put those things to use,

925
00:45:00,642 --> 00:45:02,444
but they don't want to answer
any of their phone

926
00:45:02,577 --> 00:45:04,147
or anything they don't know.

927
00:45:04,279 --> 00:45:06,615
It's like maybe they got
like a disconnect or something,

928
00:45:06,748 --> 00:45:08,884
like, We've been
looking for you, Jackie.

929
00:45:09,018 --> 00:45:11,386
Oh, sick. [chuckling]

930
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,188
We just wanted to thank you,
you know,

931
00:45:13,321 --> 00:45:14,690
for all the good
work you're doing

932
00:45:14,823 --> 00:45:16,291
- for the OTB community.
- Oh, well.

933
00:45:16,425 --> 00:45:17,859
Hey, thanks, guys. Yeah.

934
00:45:17,994 --> 00:45:20,862
You know, I tell you,
Rocco the Strangler,

935
00:45:20,997 --> 00:45:23,331
I didn't know you were
out of jail yet, huh?

936
00:45:23,465 --> 00:45:25,168
You too.
Hey, good to see you guys.

937
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,203
Hey, hey.
The whole gang's here.

938
00:45:28,336 --> 00:45:29,871
- Come on over.
- When we heard

939
00:45:30,006 --> 00:45:32,240
what you and Kitchity Katchity
were doing and, you know,

940
00:45:32,374 --> 00:45:34,443
you didn't contact us.

941
00:45:34,576 --> 00:45:36,678
And now here you are using
the name of your TV foundation.

942
00:45:36,812 --> 00:45:39,448
Yeah, you can understand why
we's a little upset with you.

943
00:45:39,581 --> 00:45:41,616
Thanks to this
good woman right here.

944
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:44,252
See, she contacted us
on behalf of Jackie

945
00:45:44,386 --> 00:45:46,521
and Kitchity Katchity
and the OTB pageant.

946
00:45:46,655 --> 00:45:48,490
She explained to us
there may have been

947
00:45:48,623 --> 00:45:50,859
a little miscommunication
between the two parties.

948
00:45:51,493 --> 00:45:54,796
Yes. I, Sissy Terrin,

949
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:56,865
Miss Nevada 19...

950
00:45:58,567 --> 00:46:01,137
I took it upon myself
to contact these

951
00:46:01,269 --> 00:46:05,407
fine gentlemen and their
little group. [chuckling]

952
00:46:07,809 --> 00:46:10,946
As the moral authority
of this state,

953
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,248
and with Jackie's blessing

954
00:46:13,381 --> 00:46:15,751
and the blessing
of Mr. Katch...

955
00:46:15,884 --> 00:46:18,487
[stammering]

956
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,589
...uh, Purple Thing...
[clearing throat]

957
00:46:20,722 --> 00:46:23,558
I offer a welcoming hand
to this pageant,

958
00:46:23,692 --> 00:46:26,129
which is based around
such a wonderful charity.

959
00:46:26,261 --> 00:46:27,562
As you may know,

960
00:46:27,696 --> 00:46:29,999
I come from
a charity-minded family.

961
00:46:30,133 --> 00:46:31,399
It's the way I was raised

962
00:46:31,533 --> 00:46:33,769
and the way
I raised my daughter,

963
00:46:33,902 --> 00:46:37,173
my beautiful little girl,
contestant number 13.

964
00:46:37,305 --> 00:46:39,008
Gorgeous kid at that.

965
00:46:39,142 --> 00:46:42,444
Young lady's not so bad herself,
a real class act.

966
00:46:42,577 --> 00:46:45,214
Oh, stop it.
You're too sweet.

967
00:46:45,914 --> 00:46:48,450
And I would like
to tell your viewers,

968
00:46:48,583 --> 00:46:51,220
if anyone thinks
that I am with Jackie

969
00:46:51,353 --> 00:46:53,055
just to benefit my little girl,

970
00:46:53,189 --> 00:46:54,923
well, that is simply a lie.

971
00:46:55,057 --> 00:46:57,559
Our love is true.

972
00:46:58,627 --> 00:47:02,531
As a matter of fact...
we're engaged.

973
00:47:03,166 --> 00:47:06,068
And your little TV audience
is the first to know.

974
00:47:08,703 --> 00:47:10,039

00:47:10,173 --> 00:47:12,374

zing pow wow,
I'm Jackie Fontaine.

996
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,869
Thank you very much for being
here at the first annual

997
00:48:14,003 --> 00:48:16,438
Jackie Fontaine
and Kitchity Katchity

998
00:48:16,571 --> 00:48:19,574
beauty pageant
to benefit the OTB Foundation.

999
00:48:19,708 --> 00:48:21,843
But first, let's bring it down.
Let's center ourselves.

1000
00:48:21,977 --> 00:48:23,912
Let's remember
exactly why we're here.

1001
00:48:24,046 --> 00:48:26,182
Not for glitz, not for glamour,
not for glitter.

1002
00:48:26,315 --> 00:48:29,918
We're here because of this
horrible disease, OTB.

1003
00:48:30,052 --> 00:48:31,887
That's right,
I got a phone call

1004
00:48:32,021 --> 00:48:34,123
from a very, very
high profile celebrity,

1005
00:48:34,257 --> 00:48:35,992
a good friend of mine
called me and said,

1006
00:48:36,125 --> 00:48:40,695
"Jackie, I got the OTB
and before those damn vultures

1007
00:48:40,829 --> 00:48:42,464
in the media picked me apart

1008
00:48:42,597 --> 00:48:45,467
like, like a Costco
rotisserie chicken.

1009
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,535
I want to come out
on my own on your program,

1010
00:48:47,669 --> 00:48:49,105
the Up All Night Show."

1011
00:48:49,238 --> 00:48:51,606
And he did,
and that's where we decided

1012
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:54,210
the whole world
needs to know about him.

1013
00:48:54,343 --> 00:48:55,710
And ladies and gentlemen,

1014
00:48:55,844 --> 00:48:58,513
that celebrity
is a good friend of mine.

1015
00:48:58,647 --> 00:49:00,283
Kitchity Katchity!

1016
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,883
[Jr. sobbing]

1017
00:49:02,018 --> 00:49:03,952
- Butch, Butch get over here.
- I'm sorry, Jackie.

1018
00:49:04,086 --> 00:49:05,954
- No, no. No, Butch.
- I promised I wouldn't cry.

1019
00:49:06,088 --> 00:49:07,956
You gotta suck it up,
you got to suck it up,

1020
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:09,958
just like your dad did,
Butch Senior.

1021
00:49:10,092 --> 00:49:11,927
You run a goddamn casino

1022
00:49:12,061 --> 00:49:13,695
and we're going to beat
OTB together.

1023
00:49:13,828 --> 00:49:15,864
Now you'll get over there,
control yourself.

1024
00:49:15,998 --> 00:49:17,565
But first,
ladies and gentlemen,

1025
00:49:17,699 --> 00:49:20,336
a lot of people
don't know shit about OTB.

1026
00:49:20,468 --> 00:49:21,569
But you know what?

1027
00:49:21,703 --> 00:49:23,039
These ladies right here,

1028
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:24,307
they know everything

1029
00:49:24,439 --> 00:49:26,175
there is to know about OTB.

1030
00:49:26,309 --> 00:49:28,710
And that's why
they're giving up tonight.

01:08:14,936 --> 01:08:17,139
Revenge is sweet.

1366
01:08:21,277 --> 01:08:23,611
Yeah! [chuckles]

1367
01:08:23,745 --> 01:08:25,281
Christmas!

1368
01:08:27,316 --> 01:08:28,683
[door shutting]

1369
01:08:28,817 --> 01:08:31,586
Jackie is like... chewing gum

1370
01:08:31,719 --> 01:08:33,122
on the bottom of your shoe.

1371
01:08:33,255 --> 01:08:35,291
You can never get rid of him.
[laughing]

1372
01:08:35,424 --> 01:08:38,060
The more you pull,
the more he sticks to you.

1373
01:08:38,194 --> 01:08:41,763
Jackie'll always make a comeback
and we'll be right there...

1374
01:08:41,896 --> 01:08:43,532
Yeah, we'll be there.

1375
01:08:43,665 --> 01:08:45,334
We'll be there
as long as we can.

1376
01:08:45,468 --> 01:08:49,338
You know, there's an old saying,
scared money never wins.

1377
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:55,244
But I'd tell you,
stupid money...

1378
01:08:55,377 --> 01:08:57,012
is an entirely
different subject.

1379
01:08:57,146 --> 01:08:59,048
And these two wrote
the book on stupid.

1380
01:08:59,181 --> 01:09:01,517
You know, Kitchity Katchity...
Which camera are we on?

1381
01:09:01,649 --> 01:09:03,651
Fuck you,
and fuck you, Jackie.

1382
01:09:03,785 --> 01:09:05,387
Fuck all of you.

1383
01:09:07,156 --> 01:09:08,524
Thank you. Good afternoon.

1384
01:09:08,656 --> 01:09:10,092
My name is Detective Johnson.

1385
01:09:10,226 --> 01:09:12,261
I'm from the crime scene unit.

1386
01:09:13,162 --> 01:09:14,629
This is where we found
the vehicle,

1387
01:09:14,762 --> 01:09:16,332
a Lincoln Continental.

1388
01:09:16,465 --> 01:09:20,469
We believe there was a struggle
inside the car...

1389
01:09:20,603 --> 01:09:23,972
that caused the car to go
off the road and flip over.

1390
01:09:24,106 --> 01:09:27,775
Mr. Katchity
was thrown from the vehicle.

1391
01:09:27,909 --> 01:09:31,046
Mr. Fontaine,
found a trail of blood,

1392
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:33,015
we believe crawled through

1393
01:09:33,149 --> 01:09:35,384
where the front window
would have been.

1394
01:09:35,518 --> 01:09:36,885
This was not unusual.

1395
01:09:37,019 --> 01:09:40,389
What was unusual...
was the impressions...

1396
01:09:40,523 --> 01:09:43,359
of a woman's high heel
stiletto footprints

1397
01:09:43,492 --> 01:09:46,028
all over where the body
would have been.

1398
01:09:46,562 --> 01:09:48,030
But when we found Mr. Fontaine,

1399
01:09:48,164 --> 01:09:50,366
we believe,
from the state he was in...

1400
01:09:51,467 --> 01:09:54,403
and obviously, the brutality
of this crime scene...

1401
01:09:55,870 --> 01:09:57,839
We believe Mr. Katchity, uh,

1402
01:09:57,972 --> 01:10:03,345
Mr. Fontaine killed...
and ate Mr. Katchity.

1403
01:10:10,885 --> 01:10:14,856
[cars passing]

1404
01:10:16,492 --> 01:10:18,793
[struggling]

1405
01:10:20,362 --> 01:10:22,464
Suck my dick,
cocksucker!

1406
01:10:22,598 --> 01:10:24,899
You don't know
what you're doing to me, huh?

1407
01:10:27,735 --> 01:10:29,371
Take this one,
I'm taking this with me.

1408
01:10:29,505 --> 01:10:31,106
Son of b.......

1409
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:33,442
[gagging coughs]

1410
01:10:36,412 --> 01:10:37,912
Fuck you.

1411
01:10:39,348 --> 01:10:40,616
[coughing]

1412
01:10:40,748 --> 01:10:46,322
[sentimental music]

1413
01:10:56,764 --> 01:10:58,300
[Jackie laughing]

1414
01:10:58,434 --> 01:11:02,204
Monkey, if I have to show you
that one more time...

1415
01:11:03,239 --> 01:11:04,939
Jackie, how do you come up
with that stuff?

1416
01:11:05,074 --> 01:11:06,442
I've heard that
a million times.

1417
01:11:06,575 --> 01:11:08,277
More times, matter of fact,
'member the time

1418
01:11:08,410 --> 01:11:10,179
I was talking about
Betty and her gal?

1419
01:11:10,312 --> 01:11:12,314
[laughing]

1420
01:11:12,448 --> 01:11:15,217
You know,
when Betty'd come over

1421
01:11:15,351 --> 01:11:17,620
and she'd pop
something on her foot.

1422
01:11:17,752 --> 01:11:19,221
[man] Murderer.

1423
01:11:19,355 --> 01:11:22,790
You killed Kitchity Katchity.

1424
01:11:23,825 --> 01:11:27,263
You killed Kitchity Katchity.

1425
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:30,898
It's nobody.
You got something to say?

1426
01:11:31,033 --> 01:11:32,301
You killed Kitchity Katchity

1427
01:11:32,434 --> 01:11:34,103
and left him
in the desert to die.

1428
01:11:34,236 --> 01:11:35,837
[Jackie] Listen here, pal.

1429
01:11:35,970 --> 01:11:38,207
You better keep your mouth shut,
you understand?

1430
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:41,909
[man]
You left wing fudge-packing...

1431
01:11:42,044 --> 01:11:43,646
- [man groaning]
- You son of a b.......

1432
01:11:43,778 --> 01:11:47,915
[man yelling, Jackie groaning]

1433
01:11:49,752 --> 01:11:52,187
[Jackie groaning]

1434
01:11:55,357 --> 01:11:57,393
[Jackie sobbing]

1435
01:11:59,628 --> 01:12:01,263
What's happened to me?

1436
01:12:02,897 --> 01:12:04,400
What have I become?

1437
01:12:05,668 --> 01:12:06,934
Oh, my God.

1438
01:12:09,672 --> 01:12:11,973
Sorry, guys. [sobbing]

1439
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:19,548
Oh, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

1440
01:12:19,682 --> 01:12:23,085
Zing pow wow.
Jackie Fontaine here. Hey.

1441
01:12:23,218 --> 01:12:26,322
Welcome to my new,
humble abode, okay?

1442
01:12:26,455 --> 01:12:29,191
We're downsizing, you know?
That's the best way to go.

1443
01:12:29,325 --> 01:12:31,694
That's what we, the corporate
people do it all the time.

1444
01:12:31,826 --> 01:12:33,162
I learned my lesson, okay?

1445
01:12:33,295 --> 01:12:36,098
We're downsizing
and and outsourcing

1446
01:12:36,231 --> 01:12:37,733
and all that stuff.

1447
01:12:37,865 --> 01:12:39,134
Matter of fact,
I got my very own

1448
01:12:39,268 --> 01:12:42,438
telemarketer man-boy
right here.

1449
01:12:42,571 --> 01:12:43,871
Julio, you're say,
hello, Julio?

1450
01:12:44,006 --> 01:12:44,972
- Hola.
- Hola.

1451
01:12:45,107 --> 01:12:46,475
I don't know if he said,

1452
01:12:46,608 --> 01:12:48,777
blow me a hello
or goodbye or whatever.

1453
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:50,279
But you know,
I'm learning.

1454
01:12:50,412 --> 01:12:52,448
He's teaching me,
I'm teaching him, you know?

1455
01:12:52,581 --> 01:12:54,650
Hey, El Morocco.

1456
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:57,186
[laughing]

1457
01:12:57,319 --> 01:12:59,621
Anyways, we're going
to be back in Vegas.

1458
01:12:59,755 --> 01:13:01,190
We're going to be everywhere.

1459
01:13:01,323 --> 01:13:03,592
Hey, you need to get that
out of there, okay?

1460
01:13:03,726 --> 01:13:05,694
Anyways, you know, um.

1461
01:13:05,828 --> 01:13:08,330
Would you put that paperweight
away too, Jesus Christ.

1462
01:13:08,464 --> 01:13:11,200
Anyways,
I tell you help nowadays.

1463
01:13:11,333 --> 01:13:14,703
You know, you can't buy help,
you can't get help.

1464
01:13:15,471 --> 01:13:17,072
I'll tell you what,
speaking of help...

1465
01:13:18,873 --> 01:13:20,376
Would you be quiet back there?

1466
01:13:20,509 --> 01:13:21,744
It's my moment.

1467
01:13:22,611 --> 01:13:26,615
I sure do miss my little pal,
Kitchity Katchity.

1468
01:13:28,016 --> 01:13:29,284
I'll tell you what,
that little guy,

1469
01:13:29,418 --> 01:13:31,787
he brought
so much joy to my life.

1470
01:13:31,919 --> 01:13:33,455
God rest his soul.

1471
01:13:34,189 --> 01:13:36,024
But, you know, he'd want us
to pick ourselves up

1472
01:13:36,158 --> 01:13:37,993
by our bootstraps
and continue on,

1473
01:13:38,127 --> 01:13:39,762
and that's what
we're going to do, okay?

1474
01:13:39,894 --> 01:13:41,830
All right. See you later.

1475
01:13:41,963 --> 01:13:43,632
Julio, let me show you
how it's, work.

1476
01:13:43,766 --> 01:13:45,467
We've got to start putting
this sh... back together, okay?

1477
01:13:45,601 --> 01:13:48,070
Okay, put the piñatas
in the place.

1478
01:13:48,203 --> 01:13:50,406
[moaning, groaning]

1479
01:13:53,108 --> 01:13:55,644
[moaning, groaning]

1480
01:13:55,778 --> 01:14:00,582
[muffled moaning, groaning]

1481
01:14:03,552 --> 01:14:04,919
[bleep]

1482
01:14:05,053 --> 01:14:06,688
- [gameshow flourish]
- Oh, hey.

1483
01:14:06,822 --> 01:14:08,190
[chuckling]

1484
01:14:08,323 --> 01:14:10,826
Zing pow wow.
Your old Uncle Jackie here.

1485
01:14:10,958 --> 01:14:13,529
You know, as long as I've been
in show business,

1486
01:14:13,662 --> 01:14:16,899
well, a night like this
is very difficult

1487
01:14:17,032 --> 01:14:18,400
because unfortunately,

1488
01:14:18,534 --> 01:14:21,837
this is Uncle Jackie's
last and final show.

1489
01:14:22,504 --> 01:14:25,140
I know, I know,
but don't worry. [chuckling]

1490
01:14:25,274 --> 01:14:28,010
Old Uncle Jackie'll
get by somehow, you know?

1491
01:14:28,143 --> 01:14:30,045
I'm like one of them
old dirty panties.

1492
01:14:30,179 --> 01:14:32,047
I mean pennies.

1493
01:14:32,181 --> 01:14:34,116
I'm going to show up somewhere.

1494
01:14:34,249 --> 01:14:35,851
You know it, but, you know,

1495
01:14:35,984 --> 01:14:39,421
before they pull the plug
on your Uncle Jackie here,

1496
01:14:39,555 --> 01:14:41,390
I want to share
something for you.

1497
01:14:41,523 --> 01:14:44,593
Okay? I got a letter from a fan

1498
01:14:44,726 --> 01:14:48,697
and this fan calls themselves
my number one fan,

1499
01:14:48,831 --> 01:14:50,599
and I believe 'em.

1500
01:14:50,732 --> 01:14:53,135
I'd like to read
this letter to you.

1501
01:14:54,336 --> 01:14:57,406
"Dear Jackie,
I'm just a small town kid

1502
01:14:57,539 --> 01:15:00,609
from one of those
crappy countries.

1503
01:15:00,742 --> 01:15:06,114
We don't get much like you
big shots out here in America...

1504
01:15:07,082 --> 01:15:09,117
but the goulash ain't bad.

1505
01:15:09,251 --> 01:15:11,286
But when I watched you on TV,

1506
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:15,057
doing one of your live
from Las Vegas shows...

1507
01:15:15,190 --> 01:15:16,692
[lips smacking]

1508
01:15:16,825 --> 01:15:19,261
...it makes me feel
like I could be someone.

1509
01:15:21,330 --> 01:15:23,465
You inspired me to dream.

1510
01:15:25,234 --> 01:15:27,236
And I know this is your
very last show,

1511
01:15:27,369 --> 01:15:30,772
but could you sing
the Buster Guy theme song

1512
01:15:30,906 --> 01:15:32,541
one last time?

1513
01:15:33,175 --> 01:15:36,778
Signed, best regards
your biggest fan."

1514
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:39,381
Why couldn't
all of you out there

1515
01:15:39,515 --> 01:15:41,917
take a lesson
from that true fan?

1516
01:15:42,684 --> 01:15:44,520
Well, I'll tell you what,
number one fan.

1517
01:15:44,653 --> 01:15:47,656
It's been a while,
I'm going to do my best.

1518
01:15:47,789 --> 01:15:49,625
Yeah, could you put
the cue card up there?

1519
01:15:49,758 --> 01:15:51,527
