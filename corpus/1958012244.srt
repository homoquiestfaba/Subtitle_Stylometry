00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:25,114
MALCOLM: Why'd you come back?

536
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,701
I mean, why come back now?

537
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,955
Like, you know, man,
six years in the air force,

538
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:34,624
little time out in Vegas.

539
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:36,066
Just trying to find my way.

540
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,713
Everything has just
led me back here, you know?

541
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:45,409
Led me back home to you guys
and Darious, my family.

542
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,430
HECTOR:
Can I get you anything, sir?

543
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,932
PORTER: I'll take a coffee, man.

544
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,684
HECTOR: Coffee.

545
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,811
PORTER:
It's good to see you, Hector.

546
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:56,145
Do I know you?

547
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,815
- It is Porter, man, you know.
Porter.

548
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,066
I used to come in here
with Malcolm.

549
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,150
HECTOR: Porter.

550
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,027
Of course,
I didn't recognize you

551
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,947
with your tattoos, your hair.

552
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,658
You got big. [both chuckle]

553
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,159
How good to see you.

554
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,060
PORTER: Good to see you, man.
HECTOR: Enjoy.

555
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,541
Surprised the old man
is still working here.

556
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:19,877
Well, he's a close friend
of ours.

557
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:24,090
I teach his granddaughter
violin, actually.

558
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:25,800
I see you're still playing.

559
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,218
Does Darious play?

560
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,344
I tried with him.

561
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,828
He doesn't have the patience.

562
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:36,227
So, uh, you know,
what does he, uh,

563
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,420
what does he know about me?

564
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,651
Why don't we
keep the conversation

565
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,529
on getting reacquainted for now?

566
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,156
All right, you say that
you're here for Darious.

567
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,474
What does that mean?
Can you explain that?

568
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,787
Meaning that I wanna be
in his life, you know?

569
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,623
I mean, if you guys
let me, of course.

570
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:03,046
Oh, Porter,
we appreciate your apology.

571
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,613
That means a lot.

572
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,594
But you walked out on us,

573
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:12,263
and you can't come back
after 12 years

574
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,164
and have it go back to normal.

575
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,394
Yeah, I understand that.

576
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,438
You know, I know it'll
take time to get warm,

577
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:23,357
but I'm willing to do
whatever it takes.

578
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:27,487
You know, everything is
on your terms completely.

579
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,864
All right, then.

580
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,182
You know, uh...

581
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:36,603
I was thinking about this
the other day.

582
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:41,167
Remember your nickname, Nini?

583
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:42,835
Yeah.

584
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,528
Yeah, I remember that shit
we used to get into.

585
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,758
Remember that Charger
you used to have, man?

586
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:52,470
I know you remember.
- Mm-hmm. I sold it.

587
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:53,846
Remember that time you was
in the front seat with him

588
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,389
and damn near broke your foot

589
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,433
'cause you stepped on the damn
floor 'cause it was all rusty?

590
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,810
Ugh.

591
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,061
PORTER:
I know you remember that.

592
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,312
I know you remember it,
too, why you trying

593
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,730
to hold that laugh, man?

594
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,732
That rusty piece of shit.

595
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,484
- I loved that car.
PORTER: Uh-huh.

596
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:07,944
It was hard for me to part
with it, but I loved it.

597
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,071
MONICA:
I told him there was no way

598
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,447
Darious was riding around in it.

599
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,325
Yeah, and I got rid of it,
thank you very much.

600
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,661
Actually, uh, since we're being

601
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:18,830
all open and honest
and everything,

602
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,355
I want to, uh...

603
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,502
I met Darious.

604
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:26,087
You know, it was...
It was a complete accident.

605
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,756
He just... he just
came by where I stay.

606
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,258
Excuse me?

607
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:33,636
Yeah, it was a couple of days
ago out by Jon's old place

608
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,304
and, like, he got
beat up by a kid

609
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,389
or something, all blooded up.

610
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,141
Did you tell him who you were?

611
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,433
PORTER:
When I introduced myself,

612
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,001
it didn't seem like
he knew who I was.

613
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:44,355
I told him my name and he...

614
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,149
I don't know why the fuck
you think he'd know your name.

615
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:48,359
You're irrelevant,
and I guess that's

616
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,777
for Nini to decide, right?

617
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,280
It was my decision to make.

618
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:53,865
He knows I didn't
have him with Malcolm,

619
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,199
and I didn't tell him about you,

620
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,242
and I'm sorry about that.

621
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:57,326
You don't gotta
apologize to him.

622
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,452
He wasn't here.

623
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,079
Did you tell him who you were?

624
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,373
No, I promise.

625
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,499
MALCOLM: And I don't know
how the fuck you think

626
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,042
he'd know who you are.

627
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,878
Don't know why the fuck you
let my kid get his ass beat...

628
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,254
It ain't got nothing to do
with you in the first place.

629
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:09,505
And the fact that
you think it does...

630
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,840
- Of course, it does.
Bruh, that's my son.

631
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:13,551
What you mean, man?
- He's your kid.

632
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:16,053
PORTER: That's my son.
MALCOLM: You believe that?

633
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,263
Is that what you think?

634
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,807
Okay, stop. Please stop it.

635
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,184
PORTER: I'm sorry.

636
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,186
I just wanna meet Darious.

637
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,438
You know,
I just wanna meet my son.

638
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:26,606
Well, unfortunately...

639
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,940
We would need
to discuss it together

640
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,234
between the two of us.

641
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,361
PORTER: Look, I get
the hostility, man.

642
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,887
I really do.

643
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,452
But I'm reformed, bro.

644
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,704
I ain't that little boy
you used to know.

645
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,081
I can promise you that.

646
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,375
I understand,
but you need to trust us

647
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,253
that we listened to you
and we need to go

648
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,380
and talk about it together.

649
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,697
Okay?

650
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:56,785
Yeah, I appreciate that.

651
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,287
Okay.

652
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:03,917
Okay.

653
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:25,790
MALCOLM: I don't think
this is a good idea.

654
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,625
I really don't think
we should let him in.

in the world.

00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,009
Let's just be good to Porter,

658
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,244
and the Lord will be good to us.

659
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,477
So he's my real father.

660
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,145
He is not your real dad.

661
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,481
Malcolm raised you.
Malcolm's your father.

662
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,924
Porter is the man I had
you with when I was young.

663
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,404
So why didn't you stay with him?

664
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,782
We were too young and he
wasn't ready to raise you.

665
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,409
Why?

666
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,286
Why wasn't he ready?

667
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,704
Because...

668
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,354
Because some people,
they run from their problems.

669
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,002
- I was a problem?
- No, honey, of course not.

670
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,753
No, no, no, of course not. No.

671
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,905
That's just how Porter
saw you, saw the situ...

672
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:21,012
Do you even want to see him?

673
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:24,473
Yeah, he's cool.

674
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:27,101
Okay. Okay.

675
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,187
Well, in that case, we all
need to be there as a family

676
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,481
because your dad and I,
we're still

677
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,816
getting reacquainted with him.

678
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,193
And I don't think we're ready
for all that yet.

679
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,779
And I know your mother and I
still gotta talk about

680
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:39,905
if we want to let you
around Porter.

681
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,657
I thought we talked about it.

682
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,785
And I think that we are not
ready for that yet, Monica.

683

What is there
left to talk about?

684

We don't know yet,
but when we decide,

685
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,793
we will let you know.
