00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,760
for CNN from the French
aircraft carrier Foch...

4
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,000
somewhere in the Mediterranean.

5
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,520
Six days ago,
as the rebellion in Chechnya...

6
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,280
spread to the neighboring Caucasus
republics, the Russian president...

7
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,600
ordered massive bombing strikes
against rebel positions...

8
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,360
around Rutul and Belokany.

9
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,240
Appalled at the loss of human life,
the President of the United States...

10
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,000
joined by the French president
and the British prime minister...

11
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,920
suspended all foreign aid
to Russia.

12
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,840
Ultranationalist leader
Vladimir Radchenko...

13
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,960
denounced the U.S. Pressure
as an act of war...

14
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,520
against the Russian Republic
and Russian sovereignty.

15
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,800
Denouncing his own president
as a U.S. Puppet...

16
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,120
he called on the Russian people
to join him in revolt.

17
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,480
He said, "This brutish and hypocritical
American intervention...

18
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,440
will not go unanswered."

19
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,520
On Tuesday, at 10:00
in the morning Moscow time...

20
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,080
the Russian parliament was suspended
and martial law was declared.

21
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,560
With the government in crisis,
the Russian Republic...

22
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,440
was entering into what can only
be described as a state of civil war.

23
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,760
Then yesterday at dawn,
Radchenko and rebel forces...

24
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,280
seized the region around Vladivostok,
including a naval base...

25
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,480
and a nuclear missile base
housing Russian ICBMs.

26
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,080
As regular Russian military forces
move in to encircle Radchenko...

27
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,520
allied military forces
are in a state of high alert.

28
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,680
These French planes
taking off behind me...

29
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,320
have been deployed near the Caucasus
since the beginning of the crisis...

30
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,360
and a crisis which started
in the Caucasus

31
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,080
has now spread to the Far East...

32
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,280
and appears to be turning into the worst
standoff since the Cuban missile crisis.

33
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,600
This is Richard Valeriani
reporting live for CNN...

34
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,880

backed by his rebel army...

50
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,120
threatened nuclear attack
on the United States and Japan.

51
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,040
The threats come as a response
to U.S. Involvement in Chechnya...

52
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,760
and are not considered idle.

53
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,680
Now sit on the board.

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,200

do you believe in magic?

00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,280
- Where'd he go?
- Good. Because if you believe...

56
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,200
- I'll get him.
- We can suspend you in the air...

57

- Be right back.

- Congratulations, Mr. Hunter.
- Thank you.

106
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,720
If one Russian citizen
is killed...

107
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,640
and I am president...

108
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,320
then I will kill 900,000 of the people
who are responsible.

109
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,600
- You'd use nuclear weapons?
- Yes, I would hit them...
- Attention!

110
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,520
With nuclear weapons.

111
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,440
- At ease. Be seated.
- [Reporter] Sir, such talk
is highly inflammatory.

112
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,160
[Radchenko] My dear young lady,
I do not engage in "talk."

113
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,240
These are serious threats, which I hope
to be in the position to carry out.

114
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,240
I take it you've seen enough?

115
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,240
Gentlemen, after a nice little vacation,
looks like we're back at it again.

116
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,120
I hope you enjoyed the peace, because
as of now, we're back in business.

117
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,280
In the good old days of Cold War, the
Russians could always be depended on...

118
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,760
doing whatever is in
their own best interests.

119
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,240
But this Radchenko's playing a whole new
ball game with a whole new set of rules.

120
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,080
Now I've heard people talk...

121
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,880
but I don't think this man's talking
to get his picture in the paper.

122
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,960
He seems to have a serious weed
up his ass and a legitimate gripe.

123
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,240
Always a dangerous combination.
And I think he's capable...

124
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,960
of doing every damn thing
he says he's going to do.

125
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,320
That's why we have to go out there
and give the man a moment of pause.

126
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,720
So ends theory.
Thus, let us begin the facts.

127
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,760
We've been informed by the NSA...

128
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,240
that an entire rebel corps
of the Russian Army is involved.

129
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,560
That's four armored divisions
numbering 60,000 men.

130
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,480
There seems to be
massive defections.

131
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,400
Vladimir seems to be winning the hearts
and minds of the Russian soldiers.

132
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,840
- Admiral.
- Thank you.

133
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,920
They've seized the region by the Chinese
and North Korean borders.

134
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,240
That includes a submarine base...

135
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,640
from which they've surged
four Akula-class attack subs.

136
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,040
They have acquired
a nuclear base at Artem...

137
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,960
that houses 25 hardened silos
for Russian ICBMs...

138
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,760
armed with up to
ten warheads apiece.

139
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,600
Now the Russian government has
assured us that talks are underway.

140
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,040
They claim that Radchenko forces
do not possess the launch codes.

141
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
But if Radchenko
were to crack them...

142
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,680
they could launch against
our west coast direct...

143
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,920
or come in over the Pole,
take out Washington and New York.

144
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,560
[Admiral] The Commander-in-Chief...

145
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,960
has directed U.S. Military forces...

146
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,880
to set DEFCON four.

147
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,400
We've been ordered
to get underway at 0600 hours...

148
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,280
to assume alert coverage, mid-Pacific,
the Far Eastern TVD target package.

149
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,240
Please keep your men informed.

150
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,600
Lieutenant Commander Hunter
is our new X.O.

151
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,080
Please bring him up to speed on
ship's personnel and supplies. Admiral?

152
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,200
- No, that's it.
- On your feet.

153
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,640

00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,240
- Here we go again, Commander.
- Thank you.

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,880
You bet. Hey, Bobby.
This is Bobby Dougherty. He's Supplies.

156
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,120
- Pleasure, Dougherty.
- Billy Linkletter, TSO.

157
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,000
- Mr. Linkletter.
- Commander.
- And you know Darik.

158
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,360
- Yes. Westergaurd. Long time no see.
- How's Julia?

159
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,280
- She's excellent.
- Good.

160
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,880
- And Roy Zimmer, Communications.
- Welcome aboard.

161
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,960
- Thank you.
- We served together on the Baton Rouge.

162
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,320
- Twice.
- That's right. We're lucky to have him.

163
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,720
- I think his dog gave me
the final seal of approval.
- He's crazy about that dog.

164
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,840
Takes him everywhere. The Navy looks
the other way 'cause he's Ramsey.

165
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,560
Navy looks the other way
'cause he's one of the few skippers
left who've seen combat.

166
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,840
- He took SEALS into Panama in '89.
- Tomahawks in the Gulf in '91.

167
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,640
- Took out eight or nine X.O. S in '94?
- Ouch.

168
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,720
- Last one caught what? Appendicitis?
- Yeah, right.

169
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,080
[Man Shouting]

170
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,080
- The Enemy Below.
- Robert Mitchum.

171
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,000
- And?
- And what?

172
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,240
- Robert Mitchum.
- Incomplete answer.

173
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,960
- The German guy with the white hair?
- Yeah. What's his name?

174
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,880
- Who was it?
- Curt Jurgens.

175

[Couple Shouting]

176
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,200
Hardy Kruger.

177
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,160
[Laughing] No way.

178
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,920
- Robert Shaw in his Nazi period.
- [Laughs]

179
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,920
Question is invalid.
We're even.

180
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
- Whoo.
- How you doin'?

181
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,200
- I'm fine. Thanks.
- Good. Address me as "sir"
when you speak to me!

182
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,480
Stand at attention, sailor!

183
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,240
Is he gonna fit in the sub?

184
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,200
Doubtful.

185
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,720
Who played the German sub commander
in The Enemy Below with Robert Mitchum?

186
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,680
- Was it Curt Jurgens or Hardy Kruger?
- Sir...

187
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,800
Wrong answer!
Drop down and give me 20! Now!

188

The guy with the ears
and a little moustache.

191

- Cary Grant.
- [Grunts]

192
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm worried about "T."

[Whining]

194
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,680
- Why?
- She doesn't know what's goin' on.

195
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,680
I think she thinks
I'm goin' away forever.

196
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,480
- I'll take care of her.
- You will?

197
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,400
- Yeah.
- You promise?

198
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,320
I promise.

199
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,720
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you too, son.

201
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,600
Okay.

202
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,760
[Sighs] You know
I don't know what to say.

203
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,120
Just say good-bye.

204
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,000
See you in my dreams.

205
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,760
Give me a kiss.

206
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,320

- How you doin', sir?

207
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,600

accounted for, sir.

208

Little ducks...

209
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,960
there's trouble
in Russia.

210
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,840
So they called us.

211
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,200
We're going over there
and bringing...

212
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,720
the most lethal killing machine
ever devised.

213
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,320
We're capable...

214
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,000
of launching
more firepower...

215
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,560
than has ever been released
in the history of war.

216
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,920
For one purpose alone:

217
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,480
To keep our country safe.

218
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,520
We constitute the front line...

219
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,400
and the last line of defense.

220
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,640
[Thunder Rumbling]

221
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,480
I expect and demand...

222
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,400
your very best.

223
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,600
Anything less, you should have
joined the Air Force.

224
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,800
[Men Laughing]

225
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,800
This might be our
Commander-in-Chief's Navy...

226
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,120
but this is my boat.

227
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,040
And all I ask is that
you keep up with me.

228
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,920
And if you can't...

229
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,800
that strange sensation you'll be feeling
in the seat of your pants...

230
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,280
will be my boot in your ass.

231

- Mr. Cob?
- Yes, sir!

00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,240
You're aware of the name of this ship,
aren't you, Mr. Cob?

233
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,200
Very aware, sir!

234
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,240
It bears a proud name,
doesn't it, Mr. Cob?

235
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,120
Very proud, sir!

236
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,680
- It represents fine people.
- Very fine people, sir!

- Who live in a fine, outstanding state.
- [Cob] Outstanding, sir!

In the greatest country
in the entire world.

- And what is that name, Mr. Cob?
- Alabama, sir!

- And what do we say?
- [Both] Go, 'Bama!

You knew to shut up
and enjoy the view.

Most eggheads want
to talk it away.

If you want
your own boat someday...

the very worst thing you can do is worry
about yourself or try to impress me.

I can't stand save-asses,
and I won't abide kiss-asses.

prepare to dive.

- Submerge the ship.
- Diving Officer, submerge the ship.

00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,920
- Make your depth 150 feet.
- Make my depth 150 feet. Aye, sir.

- [Dougherty] You don't understand?

286
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,080
Radchenko is a fanatic, okay?
He's a potential Hitler.

287
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,320
- Somebody should just shoot him.
- I have no problem with that.

288
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,120
- Good.
- Well, it's fanatics who make history.

289
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,280
- Colonel Patton was a fanatic.
- That's what made him great.

290
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,440
[Linkletter]
You think this guy is Patton?

291
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,520
He's a dangerous lunatic, threatening
nuclear war, and he means it.

292
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,560
What's that make us, since we're the
only nation to ever drop a nuclear bomb?

293
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,120
It makes us a prime target.
There's a half a dozen...

294
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,560
other Third World countries with
atom bombs who'd love to drop one on us.

295
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,520
[Dougherty] That's right.
That's why we should drop one on them.

296
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Are you a communist? You have a problem
with us dropping nuclear bombs on Japan?

297
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,080
- Shut up, Dougherty.
- You think it was a mistake, Mr. Hunter?

Using the bomb
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

- Interesting way you put that.
- How'd I put it, sir?

Very carefully.

00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,880
You do qualify your remarks.

Somebody asked me if we
should have bombed Japan...

306
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,080

Drop that fucker. Twice."

- [Men Laughing]
- I don't mean to suggest...

308
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,960
that you're indecisive,
Mr. Hunter.

309
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,880
Not at all.

310
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,560
Just, um... complicated.

312
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,240
Of course, that's the way
the Navy wants you.

313
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,040
Me, they wanted simple.

314
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,960
- Well, you certainly fooled them, sir.
- [Laughs]

315
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,880
Be careful there, Mr. Hunter.

316
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,720
It's all I got to rely on:
Bein' a simpleminded son of a bitch.

317
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,840
Rickhover gave me
my command...

318
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,920
a checklist, a target
and a button to push.

319
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,840
All I had to know
is how to push it.

320
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,880
They'd tell me when.
They seem to want you to know why.

321
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,480
I would hope they'd want
us all to know why, sir.

322
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,200
At the Naval War College...

323
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,200
it was metallurgy and nuclear reactors,
not 19th-century philosophy.

324
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,920
[Stifled Laugh]

325
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,200
"War is a continuation
of politics by other means."

Von Clausewitz.

327
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,080
I think, sir, that what he was actually
trying to say was a little more...

328
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,360
- Complicated?
- [Men Laughing]

329
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,200
Yes, the purpose of war is
to serve a political end...

330
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,400
but the true nature of war
is to serve itself.

331
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,600
[Laughing]
I'm very impressed.

332
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,120
In other words, the sailor
most likely to win the war...

00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,040
is the one most willing to part
company with the politicians...

334
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,080
and ignore everything except
the destruction of the enemy.

335
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,240
You'd agree with that.

336
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,640
I'd agree that, uh, that's what
Clausewitz was trying to say.

337
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,960
But you wouldn't agree with it?

338
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,080
No, sir, I do not. No, I just think
that in the nuclear world...

339
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,960
the true enemy
can't be destroyed.

340
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,160
[Chuckling, Tapping Glass]
Attention on deck.

341
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,560
Von Clausewitz will now tell us
exactly who the real enemy is.

- Von?

[Men Laughing]

344
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,080
In my humble opinion,
in the nuclear world...

345
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,520
the true enemy
is war itself.

[Martha And The Vandellas]
Everywhere I go your face I see

Got nowhere to run, baby

Nowhere to hide

I know you're no good for me

I'll never be, baby

00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,680
Move!

357
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,960
Fire in the galley! Chief of the watch,
sound the general alarm!

- Couldn't get to it. Too hot.

[P.A.] Attention, all hands.
Fire has been contained.

assess damage and report to Control.

367

- Initiate weapons system readiness test.
- Aye, sir.

[Tapping Keyboard]

369
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:25,080
All right, station a reflash watch.
This thing could flare back up again.

- Captain's in Control.

I agree.
The message is properly formatted.

- I concur, sir.
- Where's the X.O.?

- Sir.
- Good of you to make it, Mr. Hunter.

Get the authenticator.

Set condition 1Sq for WSRT. This is

could still flare...

- Very well. Commence hovering.
- Commence hovering. Aye, sir.

Marichek is undergoing cardiac arrest.

- We're beginning CPR.
- Chief of the watch, on the 1MC.

Gentlemen, may I have
your attention, please?

418
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,680
We've received word that a shipmate
is experiencing a medical problem.

419
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,440
We're terminating the drill. Mr.
Mahoney, take the conn. I'm going below.

00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,080
- X.O.
- [Mahoney] Aye, sir. I have the conn.

00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,440
It's okay, Chief.

424
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,440
Thank you, sir.
Sorry, sir.

[Classical]

426
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,960
[Classical]

427
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,080
[Softly] Hiya, boy.
Hiya, hiya, hiya.

428
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,440
How ya doin'?
Oh, boy. Yeah.

429
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,520
So, Mr. Hunter, do you think
I was wrong to run that drill?

430
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,480
Not necessarily, sir.

431
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,200
- Do you think I got that man killed?
- No, sir.

432
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,040
One thing had nothing to do
with the other. It was an accident.

433
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,680
- Would you have run the drill?
- No, sir, I wouldn't have.

434
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,000
Why not?

435
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,360
The fire in the galley
could have flared back up.

436
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,280
- I would have seen to it first, sir.
- I'm sure you would have.

437
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,600
Me, on the other hand, I tend to think
that's the best time to run a drill.

438
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,880
Confusion on the ship
is nothing to fear.

439
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,120
It should be taken advantage of.

440
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,160
Lest you forget, Mr. Hunter, we are
a ship of war, designed for battle.

441
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,800
You don't just fight battles
when everything is hunky-dory.

442
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,360
What'd you think, son? I was just
some crazy old coot putting everyone...

443
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,280
in harm's way
as I yell "yee-haw"?

444
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,520
That was not
my first thought, sir.

445
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,400
But there's no excuse. At the time
I was fighting the fire in the galley...

446
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,160
I did not agree
with your call, sir.

447
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,560
Take a seat.

448
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,840
[Sighs]

449
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,160
Just so we understand
each other...

450
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,320
I don't have any problems
with questions or doubts.

451
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,120
As I said to you before, I'm not
seeking the company of kiss-asses.

452
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,320
When you got somethin' to say to me,
you say it in private.

453
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,440
And if privacy doesn't permit itself,
then you bite your fucking tongue.

454
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,640
- Are we clear about that, Commander?
- As a bell, sir.

455
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,160
Those sailors out there
are just boys...

456
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,680
boys who are training to do
a terrible and unthinkable thing,
and if that ever occurs...

457
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,720
the only reassurance they'll have
that they're doing the proper thing...

458
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,600
is gonna derive from their unqualified
belief in the unified chain of command.

459
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,760
That means we don't question each
other's motives in front of the crew.

460
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,480
It means we don't
undermine each other.

461
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,480
It means in a missile drill...

462
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,080
they hear your voice right after mine,
without hesitation.

463
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,720
- Do you agree with that policy, sailor?
- Absolutely, sir.

464
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,000
We're here to preserve democracy,
not to practice it.

465
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,760
There'll be a memorial service in
the enlisted men's mess at 1100 hours.

466
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,200
- Go see to it.
- Aye, aye, sir.

467
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,120
Oh, Hunter.

468
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,040
Short of the outbreak
of World War III...

469
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,240
the ship sinking or being
attacked by a giant octopus...

470
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,560
I'd like to be undisturbed
for the next 30 minutes.

471
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,680
I'll see to it, sir.

472
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,440
By the way, it was Marichek's
300 pounds that killed him.

473
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,480
Not the fire.

474
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,400
Dismissed.

475
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,960
[Sighs]

476
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,280
One, two, three, four.

477
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,680
Back. Back.

478
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,720
One, two. One, two.

479
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,920
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

480
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,280
Does it make any sense to you to start
a drill in the middle of a fire?

481
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,960
- Fire was out, wasn't it?
- Yeah, and a man died too.

482
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,720
- Not 'cause of what the captain did.
- What?

483
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,080
Not 'cause of what
the captain did.

484
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,040
Weps...

485
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,360
a fire is a serious threat
to the ship.

486
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,600
- Now where was he? Why didn't
he check it out first, huh?
- That's his style.

487
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,640
- He's a hard-ass.
- So what?

488
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,560
So you wanna fight him,
go ahead.

489
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,280
You wanna get along, you gotta get
to understand him a little bit.

490
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,040
Two schools of thought here.
To him, you're Annapolis...

491
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,400
Harvard, expert on theory,
well-versed in world affairs.

492
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,440
Ha!

493
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,520
He's had his head up his ass
drivin' ships for the last 25 years.

494
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,320
He's probably
a little paranoid about that.

495
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,560
I mean, Navy's all he's got.

496
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,520
Navy and that little rat-dog of his.

497
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,960
That's why his wife left him.

498
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,440
So what are you saying?

499
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,600
I'm just sayin' watch out.
Give him a little room.

500
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,680
Let him get to know you.

501
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,080
You do pants too?

502
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,800
Conn/Radio:
Receiving emergency action message.

503
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,040
Recommend alert one.
Recommend alert one!

504
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,960
Alert one! Alert one!
Incoming emergency action message!

505
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,000
Alert one! Alert one!
Incoming EAM.

506
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,720
[Zimmer] Captain.

507
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,160
Captain has asked me to brief you...

508
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,320
on the emergency action message
we just received.

509
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,880
As you know,
before we got underway...

510
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,320
the Russian army was in position
and circling the rebel camps...

511
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:57,400
and Radchenko started making extravagant
threats should anyone move in on him...

512
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,960
that he would launch
his land-based nuclear weapons
at the United States and at Japan.

513
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,160
The only safeguard was that the Russian
government controlled the launch codes.

514
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,400
Intel now indicates that those
launch codes have been compromised.

515
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,320
U.S. Military forces have been
directed to set DEFCON three.

516
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,640
The last time we hit
this state of emergency...

517
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,160
was 32-and-a-half years ago
during the Cuban missile crisis.

518
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,520
So this is what it's all about,
gentlemen. It's what we train for.

519
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,520
Captain.

520
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,560
The NCA has determined that...

521
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,720
should our satellites detect
rebel missiles being fueled...

522
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,920
which means they could be
launched in just over one hour...

523
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,240
we'll be compelled to act.

524
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,120
Now given our patrol sector
here in the Emperor Sea Mounts...

525
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,480
it seems clear that our friends
in the Pentagon...

526
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,000
are setting us up for
a potential preemptive strike.

527
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,960
It's important
to remain focused.

528
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,400
Keep your men informed.

529
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,880
Any questions?

530
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,000
Dismissed.

531
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,880
- We lost that frying unit, and then...
- [Glass Shattering]

532
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,840
- We can't get the same capacity in...
- [Men Shouting]

533
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,760
- [Glass Shattering]
- Hey, man!

534
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,280
I'm gonna fuck you up!
Get out! Get...

535
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,200
Get out of here, man! Get him out!
Motherfucker!

536
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,840
- Fuckin' piece of shit.
- Bennefield, you crazy, man?

537
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,280
- Rivetti, what's up?
- I'm sorry, sir.

538
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,560
- It's just a difference of
opinion that got out of hand.
- What about?

539
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,160
It's really too silly to talk about,
sir. I'd rather just forget about...

540
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,880
I don't give a damn about
what you'd rather forget about.
Why were you two fighting?

541
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,040
I said that the Kirby Silver Surfer
was the only real Silver Surfer...

542
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,960
and that the Moebius Silver Surfer
was shit.

543
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,880
And Bennefield's
a big Moebius fan, and...

544
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,840
It just got out of hand.
I pushed him; he pushed me.

545
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,640
- I lost my head, sir. I'm sorry.
- Rivetti, you're a supervisor.

546
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,040
You can get a commission like that.

547
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,520
I know it, sir.
You're 100% right.

548
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,080
- It'll never happen again.
- It better not happen again.

549
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,400
I see this kind of nonsense,
I'm gonna write you up. You understand?

550
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,320
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

551
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,760
You have to set an example
even in the face of stupidity.

552
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,800
Everybody that reads comic books
knows that Kirby Silver Surfer
is the only true Silver Surfer.

553
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,600
- Now am I right or wrong?
- [Chuckling] You're right, sir.

554
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,640
- All right. Get out of here.
- Yes, sir.

555
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,400
- Captain.
- How can I help you?

556
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,440
Test results
from the missile drill.

557
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,160
This the best
they can do?

558
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,480
No, sir, but that's
what they did.

559
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,840
I want this down to five minutes.
Train on it.

560
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,680
Yes, sir.

561
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,160
Tell your buddy Weps
we're gonna do it again.

562
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,080
We're gonna keep on doin' it
until he gets it right.

563
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,480
Damn.

564
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,120
Feels like the whole crew
needs a kick in the ass.

565
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,480
Or a pat on the back, sir.

566
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,760
I just witnessed a fight down in
crew's mess. No big deal, but...

567
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,560
I think the men are a little on edge
with all we're going through.

568
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,560
- Morale seems to be a bit low.
- [Chuckling]

569
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,280
Well, you seem to have
the pulse of the men.

570
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,560
Thank you, sir.

571
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,600
May I have your
attention, please?

572
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,360
Summer's here and
the time is right

573
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,000
- Mr. Hunter has informed me...
- For dancin' in the street

574
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,000
that morale may be a bit low...

575
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,960
that you may be a bit...

576
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,960
- On edge.
- On edge.

577
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,400
So I suggest this:

578
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,840
Any crew member who feels
he can't handle the situation...

579
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,560
can leave the ship right now.

580
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,160
Gentlemen, we're at DEFCON three.

581
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,520
War is imminent.

582
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,840
This is the captain.

583
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,760
That is all.

584
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,280
Very inspiring, sir.

585
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,240
Come on, Bear.
Come on. Come on.

586
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,960
[Beep]

587
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,800
Sup?
Come here.

588
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,200
You hear that?

589
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,120
[Beeping]

590
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,680
I've got a broadband contact
bearing 047.

591
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,880
Assigning tracker sierra in ATF.

592
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,320
Conn/Sonar: We have a possible
submerged submarine bearing 047.

593
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,480
Designate contact: Master 28.

594
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,560
Sonar/Conn: Aye.
Man battle stations torpedo.

595
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,520
- Rig for ultraquiet.
- Make tubes one and four fully ready.

596
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,480
Make tubes one and four fully ready.
Aye, sir.

597
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,400
[Alarm Ringing]

598
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,320
[P.A.]
Man battle stations torpedo.

599
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,920
[Alarm Continues]

600
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,080
- All right, what do you got?
- Sir, we have
a possible submerged submarine...

601
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,840
bearing 049,
designate master 28.

602
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:42,080
- [Beeping]
- Best depth for evasion, sir,
is 831 feet to avoid that sub.

603
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,120
Lieutenant Mahoney,
this is the captain.

604
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,240
Increase your speed to standard.
Come left to course 270.

605
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,000
Make your depth
831 feet, smartly.

606
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,440
- You find out who that is.
- Aye, sir.

607
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,600
- Who are you, sweetheart?
- Helm, all ahead standard.

608
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,520
Dive. Make your depth
831 feet, smartly.

609
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,000
Aye, sir.

610
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,360

611
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,240

from National Command Authority
for strategic missile launch, Captain.

616
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,960
- I concur, sir.
- Get the authenticator.

617
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,280
Chief of the watch,

619

00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,320
- Man battle stations missile...
- Sir, request permission

621
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,560

628
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,760
Sir, your captain's
missile key.

629
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:55,400
This is the captain. Set condition 1Sq
for strategic missile launch.

630
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,480
- [Turns Radio Down]
- Spin up missiles 1 - 5 and 20 - 24.

631
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,000
The release of nuclear weapons
has been authorized.

632
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,000
This is not a drill.

633
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,280
X.O., take the conn. I'm going
to my stateroom for the launch keys.

634
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,320
X.O. Has the conn.

635
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,000
Set condition 1Sq
for strategic missile launch.

636
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,000
Spin up missiles 1 - 5,
20 - 24.

637

The release of nuclear weapons
has been authorized.

638
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,360
This is the X.O.

639
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,200
Conn/Weapons: Estimated time

640
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,160
is 14 minutes, sir.

641
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,600
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

642
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,480
Go, sailor, go.

643
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,640
[P.A.] Set condition 1Sq
for strategic missile launch.

644
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,600
- Comin' through!
- Spin up missiles 1 - 5...

645
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,320
and 20 - 24.

646
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,640
- I have the conn.
- The captain has the conn.

00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,800
Oh, Jesus. Oh, God.

653
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,480
Uh, Conn/Sonar: Uh, sir,
we have his classification.

654
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,160
Mark that tape.
Get the classification on your monitor.

655
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,720
- Rivetti, what the hell is going on?
- Sir, the master 28...

656
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,280
is classified as
a Russian Akula-class hunter-killer.

657
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:07,160
Bearing 196, sir! He's close,
but I don't think he's spotted us.

658
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,480
- Stay on him!
- Aye, sir.

659
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,400
- Captain has the conn.
- [Cob] Passing 800 feet, sir.

660
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,360
Continue to dive.
Give me five degree down bubble.

661
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,160
- Continue rigging for ultraquiet.
- Aye, aye, sir.

662
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,640
Five degree down bubble.
Rigging for ultraquiet, sir.

663
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,080
Gentlemen, this is the captain.

664
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,120
We have an Akula-class
submarine out there.

665
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:51,520
We know Radchenko controls at least four
submarines. This could be one of them.

666
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:55,800
Russian rebels have threatened
to launch against our country...

667
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,720
and are fueling right now.

668
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,120
They will have launch capability
in 60 minutes.

669
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:06,120
We have orders to launch our missiles,
which is exactly what we're going to do.

670
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,320
We are rigging for ultraquiet.
All hands, be ready.

671
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,600
This is as real as it gets.

672
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,080
We'll presume nothing,
defend ourselves at all cost.

673
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,560
If that sub even comes around or opens
up a tube door, we'll take her out.

674
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,680
Passing 900 feet.

675
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,280
- He's gone.
- Like hell he is.

676
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,200
He's up there.

677
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,920
950.

678
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,280
Conn/Weapons: Missile systems
ready to launch in 11 minutes.

679
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,520
[Beeping]

680
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,000
Conn/Radio: Receiving transmission on
extremely low frequency receiver, sir.

681
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,920
Very well.
Mr. Hunter, go to Radio, please.

682
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,600
[Beeping]

683
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,320
- Okay, pull up the code. X.O.
- What do you got?

684
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:11,120
Incoming EAM, but we're too deep
to receive any radio communication, sir.

685
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,000
[Signal Blaring]

686
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,600
- Captain.
- X.O.

687
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,360
We got a limited radio transmission
indicating an incoming EAM.

688
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,880
We need to go shallow
to reestablish communications.

689
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,320
With that sub still up there?

690
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,560
Mr. Hunter, it's my inten...

691
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,960
- Come up to conn, Mr. Hunter.
- Yes, sir.

692
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,680
- Zero bubble.
- Zero bubble. Aye, sir.

693
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,600
1275 feet, sir.

694
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,720
[P.A.] Conn/Weapons: Missile systems
ready to launch in ten minutes.

695
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,120
- Sir.
- [P.A.] Attention, all hands.

696
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,600
- Ship has been rigged for ultraquiet.
- Captain?

697
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:04,000
When our missile system
is ready, Mr. Hunter...

698
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,640
it is my intention
to rise to launch depth...

699
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,320
launch our birds
and then get the hell out of there.

700
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,720
Not until then.

701
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,160
I can't jeopardize
the safety of this ship.

702
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,520
Yes, sir.

703
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,800
May I suggest that we float
the buoy, sir? We have enough cable.

704
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,480
That should give us enough reach
to receive the EAM transmission.

705
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,400
Sir.

706
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,320
Very well.
Float the buoy.

707
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,920
Chief of the watch,
float the buoy.

708
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,320
Float the radio buoy.
Aye, sir.

709
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,800
[Chief Of The Watch]
Radio buoy deploying, sir.
Tension 2,000 pounds.

710
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,400
Very well.

711
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:55,360
Conn/Weapons: Estimated time to 1Sq:
8 minutes, 30 seconds, sir.

712
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,720
[Metal Grinding]

713
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,400
- [Panel Beeping]
- The winch!

714
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,880
- Conn/Sonar: We have a sound short
from the buoy winch!
- Stop the goddamn winch!

715
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,480
- [Grinding Stops]
- Winch is stopped, sir!

716
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,160
Goddamn it.

717
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,480
TSO, is that sound
still out there?

718
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,480
- Sonar/TSO:
Is that sound still out there?
- [Faint Radio Transmission]

719
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,000
Sound's gone, sir.

720
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,960
- [Sonar Bleeping]
- I'm getting something.

721
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,240
- [Bleeping Continues]
- Sup, he's comin' around!

722
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,600
Conn/Sonar: The Akula's
turning toward, sir!

723
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,960
Conn/Sonar:
Torpedo in the water! Bearing 241!

724
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,480
Conn/Sonar: Second torpedo
in the water! Bearing 242!

725
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,280
All ahead flank!
Right full rudder!

726
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,160
Conn/Sonar:
3,000 yards and closing, sir!

727
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,080
Maneuvering/Conn:
Cavitate! Cavitate!

728
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,840
- Sound the collision alarm!
- Sound collision alarm! Aye, sir!

729
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,480
- [Rivetti] 2,500 yards.
- Rig ship for impact!

730
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,840
Hang onto your ass, gentlemen!
2,000 yards.

731
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,240
1,500 yards.

732
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:44,240
Bearing 070! 071!
1,200 yards!

733
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,240
- 1,000 yards and closing fast!
- Conn/Radio:

734
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:55,520
Receiving emergency action message.
Recommend alert one!

735
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,960
- [Beeping]
- [Rivetti] 950 yards!

736
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,120
Launch a five-inch evasion device.
Launch the countermeasures.

737
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,600
- Countermeasures away, sir.
- Shift your rudder to left full.

738
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,600
[Rivetti] 500 yards and closing fast.

739
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,520
300 yards and closing, sir.

740
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,040
Sir, the first torpedo's going
after the countermeasures!

741
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,720
They missed!
They missed!

742
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,480
Sonar/Conn, Conn/Sonar: Second torpedo
incoming! It's gonna be close!

743
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,920
Conn/Sonar: The Akula's
disappeared in the thermal, sir.

744
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,320
All ahead standard!
Rudder amid ships!

745
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,800
- All ahead standard.
Rudder amid ships. Aye.
- All stations.

746
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,560
All stations, report damage.
Report damage.

747
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,160
[P.A.] Engine room reports
number one ASW pump failed.

748
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,120
Control/Torpedo Room:
Three feet of water in the bilge.

749
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,200
Request a team
with a submersible pump.

750
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,760
Control/Engine Room:
Request all E-division personnel...

751
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,160
lay to the engine room
to assist in ground isolation.

752
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,600
Sonar/Conn:
Report hostile contact.

753
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:26,360
- Conn/Sonar: Uh, we lost him, sir.
- Well, keep looking.

754
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,000
- He's out there looking for us.
- Aye, sir.

755
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,360
Weapons/Conn:
Estimated time to 1Sq.

756
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,800
Conn/Weapons: Missile systems
ready to launch...

757
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,880
- in six minutes.
- [Ramsey] Very well.

758
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,120
Main seawater pump
is out of commission.

759
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,880
Mr. Zimmer,
where's that EAM?

760
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,360
Mr. Zimmer,
where's that EAM?

761
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,800
- You all right, son?
- Yes, sir.

762
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,440
- That's it?
- Ah, uh-huh. It's incomplete, sir.

763
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,920
We lost it when the radio buoy cable
got severed.

764
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,320
All right.

765
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,760
All right, gentlemen,
let's get on with it.

766
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,320
All ahead one-third.

767
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,040
- [Bell Ringing]
- Steady as you go.

768
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,920
All ahead one-third.
Steady. Aye, sir.

769
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,440
Make your depth 150 feet.
Zero bubble.

770
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,360
Up slow and silent
to launch depth.

771
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,080
Up slow and silent to launch depth.
Aye, aye, Captain.

772
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:27,560
Captain?
Got the EAM.

773
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,320
- What do you think?
- I think there's nothing on this.

774
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,600
Yes, sir. It, uh, got cut off
during the attack.

775
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,680
Then it's meaningless.

776
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:40,160
Sir, this is an EAM
pertaining to nuclear missiles.

777
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,360
No, Mr. Hunter,
that's a message fragment.

778
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,680
Because it got cut off
during the attack, sir.

779
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,800
The message could mean anything.
It could be a message to abort.

780
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,840
- It could be a message...
- Could be a fake Russian transmission.

781
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,920
Which is exactly why
we need to confirm it, sir.

782
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,640
- All I'm asking for is the time
we need to get back on line.
- Calm down, Mr. Hunter.

783
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,040
- I am calm.
- You don't appear to be calm.

784
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:00,400
Conn/Weapons: Missile systems
ready to launch in four minutes.

785
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,320
- Step aside, seaman.
- Yes, sir.

786
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:07,440
[Faint Radio Transmission]

787
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:11,600
We have orders in hand, and those orders
are to make a preemptive launch.

788
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,840
Every second that we lose
increases the chances...

789
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,400
that by the time our missiles arrive,
their silos could be empty...

790
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,440
'cause they've flown their birds
and struck us first.

791
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,680
- Yes, sir.
- You know as well as I do...

792
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,400
that any launch order received without
authentication is no order at all.

793
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:25,320
- Captain... National Mili...
- That's our #1 rule.

794
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,280
That rule is the basis for the scenario
we've trained on time and time again.

795
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,920
- Yes, sir.
- It's a rule we follow
without exception.

796
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,880
Captain, National Military Command
Center knows what sector we're in.

797
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,760
They have satellites looking down on us
to see if our birds are aloft.

798
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,640
And if they're not, then they give
our orders to somebody else.

799
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,200
That's why we maintain more than one
sub. It's what they call "redundancy."

800
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,720
- I know about redundancy, Mr. Hunter.
- All I'm saying...

801
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,280
All I'm saying, Captain,
is that we have backup.

802
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:01,560
Now, it's our duty not to launch
until we can confirm.

803
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:06,240
You're presuming that we have other
submarines out there ready to launch.

804
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,000
But as captain,
I must assume...

805
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,720
that our submarines could have been
taken out by other Akulas.

806
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,240
We can play these games
all night, Mr. Hunter...

807
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,920
- but I don't have the luxury
of your presumptions.
- Sir...

808
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,440
Mr. Hunter, we have rules that are not
open to interpretation...

809
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,400
personal intuition, gut feelings,
hairs on the back of your neck...

810
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,600
little devils or angels
sitting on your shoulders.

811
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,400
- Captain...
- We're all very well aware...

812
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,480
of what our orders are
and what those orders mean.

813
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:30,520
They come down from
our Commander-in-Chief.
They contain no ambiguity.

814
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,080
- Captain, sir...
- Mr. Hunter, I've made the decision.

815
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,600
I'm captain of this boat.
Now shut the fuck up!

816
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,200
Damn.

817
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,400
Weapons/Conn:

818
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,880
Shift targeting
to target package SLBM 64741/2.

819
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,800
This is the captain.

820
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,800
- Captain, I cannot concur.
- Repeat my command.

821
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:06,000
Sir, we don't know what this means.
Our target package could have changed.

822
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,520
You repeat this order
or I'll find somebody who will!

823
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:12,560
- Hell no, you won't, sir.
- You're relieved of your position.

824
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,880
Cob, remove Mr. Hunter
from the control room.

825
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,840
- Get Lieutenant Zimmer in here now!
- No, sir, I do not concur...

826
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:21,640
and I do not recognize your authority
to relieve me on the command
under Navy regulations.

827
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,960
- Cob, arrest this man and get him out!
- Captain Ramsey...

828
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,480
under operating procedures governing
the release of nuclear weapons...

829
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:30,000
we cannot launch our missiles
unless both you and I agree!

830
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,440
- Cob, what are you waiting for?
- Now this is more than formality, sir.

831
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,120
This is why your command must
be repeated! It requires my assent!

832
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,840
I do not give it, and, furthermore,
you continue upon this course...

833
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:41,080
- and insist upon this launch without
confirming this message first...
- Son of a bitch.

834
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,800
- I will be forced,
backed by the rules of precedents...
- Chief of the boat...

835
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,720
- as captain and commanding
officer of the USS Alabama...
- authority and command...

836
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,600
- regulation 08150H6...
- I order you to place
the X.O. Under arrest...

837
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,200
- on the charge of mutiny!
- Of the Navy regulations...

838
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,120
- to relieve you...
- I say again, I order you...

839
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,040
- of command, Captain!
- To place the X.O. Under arrest...

840
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,280
on the charge of mutiny!

841
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,480
- Cob!
- Captain, please, the X.O. Is right.

842
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,600
We can't launch
unless he concurs.

843
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,840
"To the USS Alabama.

844
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,880
Rebel-controlled missiles
being fueled.

845
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,640
Launch codes compromised.
Dissidents threaten launch
at continental United States.

846
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:15,360
Set DEFCON two.
Immediately launch ten
Trident missile sorties."

847
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,680
They're fueling their missiles!
We don't have time to fuck around!

848
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,920
Sir, I think you need time
to think this over.

849
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,360
I don't have
to think this over!

850
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,160
Captain, I relieve you
of your command of this ship.

851
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,280
Cob, escort the captain
to his stateroom.

852
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,720
- I'm assuming command.
- You're not assuming anything.

853
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:37,640
Chief of the boat, Captain Ramsey's
under arrest. Lock him in his stateroom.

854
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,240
- Captain, please...
- Now, Cob!

855
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,800
Aye, sir.
Mitchell! Walker!

856
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:45,240
Take the captain below.

857
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,120
You're way out
of your league, Hunter.

858
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,560
You're not ready to make
tough decisions yet.

859
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,760
What the hell
we waitin' for?

860
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:52,640
Anybody here disagrees
with what I've done...

861
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:58,240
then you feel free
to relieve yourself of duty now.

862
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,240
Anybody?

863
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,800
All right.

864
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,800
- All stations.
- Aye, sir.

865
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:37,200
This is the Executive Officer.

866
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,640
I have assumed
command of this ship...

867
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:44,080
under authority granted me
by Navy regulations.

868
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,840
I have relieved Captain Ramsey of his
duties for acting in contravention...

869
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,480
of the rules and regulations
regarding nuclear weapons release.

870
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:55,280
It is my intention
to delay the missile launch...

871
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:59,120
maintaining our current state
of readiness...

872
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,600
pending confirmation
of an emergency action message...

873
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:05,640
- that was cut off during the attack.
- [Sighs]

874
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:08,360
Remain at battle stations missile.

875
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,280
Carry on.

876
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,200
[Locks Door]

877
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,120
What the hell
are we doin', Fred?

878
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,680
I don't know about you,
but I'm pissin' my pants.

[Bear Softly Growls]

880
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,040
Come on, boy.

881
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:50,880
Conn/Weapons: Russians will have
missile launch capability...

882
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,640
in 39 minutes.

883
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,480
[Hunter] Chief of the boat.

884
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,880
Sir?

885
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,800
Thank you, Cob.

886
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,560
"Thank you"?
Fuck you.

887
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:10,000
Get it straight, Mr. Hunter.
I'm not on your side.

888
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,040
Now you could be wrong.

889
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,920
But wrong or right, the captain can't
just replace you at will.

890
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,680
That was completely improper. And that's
why I did what I did, by the book.

891
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,600
I thank you anyway.

892
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:39,920
Radio/Conn: Mr. Zimmer, get
those communications back on line now.

893
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,440

Aye, aye, Captain.

01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:50,120
- Are you ready?
- Uh... ready. Go.

895
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,360
Jesus.
This fuckin' thing...

896
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,240
You know, this whole system is crashed;
radio buoy is severed.

897
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:58,080
- What the fuck does he want us to do?
- Shit electrons?

898
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,480
Hey, Vossler, we need communications,
not smart-ass remarks.

899
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:03,280
- Aye, sir.
- All stop, ten degrees up.

Sir, don't you want to fire back?
Torpedoes are ready, sir.

908
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,280
No, we're in too close.
Our weapons won't have time to arm.

- Damn it! Let's just shoot this fucker!

913
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:13,160
- What's 1,000 yards for?
- 'Cause it takes 1,000 yards
for the torpedoes to arm!

914
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,080
Jesus! Who'd you fuck
to get on this ship?

01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:55,960
They were too close to arm, sir.

You've got to come!

981
01:08:55,360 --> 01:09:00,000
Move, move! Barnes, come on, come on!
You can do it! Move it!

982
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,720
Bilge Bay/Conn:
Seal that bay.

983
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:05,440
Barnes, let's go! Come on!
I've got to close the hatch!

984
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,760
What the fuck
are we doing here?

985
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:13,400
Bilge Bay/Conn:
I say again, seal that bay.

986
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:16,040
Sir, there are men down there,
and they're gonna drown!

987
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,680
Lieutenant Hellerman,
you have your orders!

988
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,600
Now seal the goddamn bay
before we all go down!

989
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:25,280
Barnes!
Please get the fuck out!

990
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,080
Barnes!

991
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:38,360
Come on!
Barnes!

992
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:12,880
Conn/Bilge Bay:

993
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,240
Seawater hatch is sealed, sir!

994
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,600
Very well.

998
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,360
Conn/Maneuvering:

999
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:06,320
Main seawater cross valve repaired!

1000
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:16,960
- And rising.
- Propulsion limit! Ahead full, sir!

1001
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,200
- Take us up to periscope depth.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1002
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,760
Give me five.

1003
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,520
[Sobbing]

1004
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,960
All right, we're livin'.
We're livin', gentlemen.

1005
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,960
- Step aside, Tommy.
- I'm sorry, sir. The X.O. Ordered...

1006
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,360
Fuck the X.O.!

1007
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:14,480
This ship has been hit,
and I'm going in to see my captain.

1008
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,400
Now stand aside.

1009
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,960
Stand aside!

1010
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,400
[Unlocking Door, Knocking]
Captain?

1011
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:28,120
[Opera Playing]

1012
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:31,120
- Sir.
- How bad is it, Mr. Dougherty?

1013
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:36,520
- It's bad, sir.
- I've just been looking
at Hunter's file here.

1014
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,600
The closest to combat he's been
is a policy seminar.

1015
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:42,600
Give me an order, sir.

1016
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:47,360
As quietly as you can, you get
to Mr. Zimmer and Mr. Westergaurd.

1017
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,480
How about Linkletter?

1018
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:53,160
Nah, you won't be able to talk
to the TSO. He's at the conn.

1019
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:56,320
But you can get to Weps.
We got to have Weps. He's the key.

1020
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:01,120
You get me those men, a small security
force; then come back and get me.

1021
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:02,280
Aye, sir.

1022
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:03,840
Don't get overzealous and
try to recruit the whole ship.

1023
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:06,240
We'll lead from the top down.

1024
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:09,240
Aye, sir. Right away.

1025
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,880
[Opera Continues]

1026
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:13,800
[Door Closes]

1027
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,480
The radio's 50%.

1028
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,120
Can I talk to you
in the passageway?

1029
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,840
Right now, Pete.
Come on.

1030
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,640
[Sighs]
What's goin' on?

1031
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:43,240
We're not gonna let this go down
with the X.O. At the helm.

1032
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,800
- We're not?
- No, we're not. I've been
with the captain for years...

1033
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:49,120
and this asshole Hunter
shows up, and I'm supposed
to follow him 'cause he says so?

1034
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,640
You're not supposed to;
you've been ordered to.

1035
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:53,720
That's what this is about:
Proper orders.

1036
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:56,480
Proper orders? He has proper orders.
He won't act on them.

1037
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,840
He's in command now!

1038
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:03,000
If they order him to launch, we'll
launch, and we'll blow 'em all to hell.

1039
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:06,280
But I'd rather go down myself
than get this one wrong.

1040
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,200
Look, our procedures are clear.

1041
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:11,320
In the absence of a contravening order,
in a situation like this...

1042
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,880
- we follow the orders in hand.
- Exactly.

1043
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:16,040
You know how many checks we do to make
sure a launch order is authentic?

1044
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,680
The X.O. Agreed
with those orders.

1045
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,920
Now he just wants to throw them away?
They don't count?

1046
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,960
- He's lost his nerve.
- Bullshit! I know this guy, Bobby!

1047
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,880
Weps, we've been ordered to launch.

1048
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:29,440
Now why in the world would we do that if
they weren't prepared to launch at us?

1049
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:32,680
We don't know that for sure.
That's the whole point.

1050
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,920
That's why he wants time
to confirm the message.

1051
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,800
That's the whole fucking point is
we don't have time!

1052
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:41,000
Radchenko is fueling his birds.
Now why do you think he's doing that?

1053
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:46,240
Why? You don't put on a condom
unless you gonna fuck!

1054
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:49,440
Go back to your station.
Go back to your station and stay there.

1055
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,120
Come on, man.

1056
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:58,760
Peter, think about your family, man.

1057
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:02,680
I am. I am!

1058
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:11,160
I mean, what do you...
What do you plan to do?

1059
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:16,120
Nothing without you.
You're senior officer department head.
The TSO's with Hunter.

1060
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,280
And you have the keys
to the small arms locker.

1061
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:22,840
Now we want to recruit a few more men,
and then we're gonna open that arsenal.

1062
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,760
[Dougherty] I just talked
to the captain in his room.

1063
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,080
He specifically asked for you.

1064
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,640
He says we cannot go
without you.

1065
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:34,600
I don't believe this.
[Sighs]

1066
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:36,760
This is a mutiny, Peter.

1067
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,720
There's only two sides
to a mutiny.

1068
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:41,240
Now, your captain
is asking for your help.

1069
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,840
What are you gonna do?

1070
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:48,280
What are you gonna do?

1071
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,440
All right.

1072
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:07,800
Conn/Weapons: Russian missiles
will have launch capability...

1073
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,800
in 24 minutes.

1074
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,240

status on that radio repair?

1080
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:58,920
Conn/Radio: All systems are still
down, sir. Lieutenant Zimmer isn't here.

1081

- Where is he?
- [Vossler] I don't know, sir.

1082
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,120
Very well.

- Send a man and find Zimmer.
- Aye, sir.

- Get a side arm.
- Aye, aye, sir.

- Chief Young.
- Aye, Chief.

- I don't know, sir.

- Yes, sir.

No, I don't think you do.
Let me explain it to you.

If we launch and we're wrong...

1112

is gonna launch at us.

So it's all about knowing,
Mr. Vossler.

1115
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,880
We have to know whether or not our order
to launch has been recalled or not.

1116
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:12,240
The only way we're gonna know is if
you fix that radio. You understand me?

Yes, sir.

1118
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:17,000

- Yeah, I seen Star Trek.
- Star Trek. You know, Star Trek.
The USS Enterprise. All right.

1120
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,920
You remember when the Klingons
were gonna blow up the Enterprise?

1121
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:25,720
And Captain Kirk calls down to Scotty,
"Scotty, I gotta have more power."

1122
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:29,040
- He needs more, more warp speed. Yeah.
- Warp speed. Exactly.

1123
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,520
Well, I'm Captain Kirk.
You're Scotty. I need more power.

If you do not get this radio up,
a billion people are gonna die.

It's up to you. I know that's a shitty
deal, but you got it. Can you handle it?

1129
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,480
- No, Vossler.
- Then get on it.

01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:02,280
- I have the conn.
- [Mahoney] X.O. Has the conn.

Lock him up

1142
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:02,320
Of all the people.

1143
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:17,200
Weps, return to missile control.
Mr. Zimmer, you stay with me.

1144
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,120
- Aye, aye, sir.
- The rest of you,
return to your stations.

1145
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:22,560
Inform your men directly
that the captain is in command.

1146
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:25,000
- I have the conn.
- Captain has the conn.

1147
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,880
Diving officer,
make your depth 150 feet.

1148
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:30,880
- At 150 feet. Aye, sir.
- 1MC.

1149
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,800
[Radioman] Aye, sir.

1150
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:35,040
May I have
your attention, please.

1151
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:37,920
Crew of the USS Alabama...

1152
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:41,280

We'll maintain security alert.

Authorized movement

In the absence
of further radio communication...

1156
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:52,640
on orders from
the National Command Center...

1157
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:55,680
we'll achieve launch depth
as quickly as we can...

1158
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,760
for strategic missile launch.

1159
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,920
We all know what this means.

1160
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,560
It's not something
one would wish for...

1161
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:05,280
but we have the obligation
under authenticated orders...

1162
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:09,360
issued by our Commander-ln-Chief
to prevent the attack on our country.

1163
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:13,720
Russian missiles will have
launch capability in 15 minutes.

1164

Set condition 1Sq.

1165

Spin up missiles 1 - 5...

1166
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:21,520
and 20 - 24
for strategic missile launch.

1167
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,880
The use of nuclear weapons
has been authorized.

1168
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:29,200
This is the captain.
Mr. Zimmer is the new X.O.

1169
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:33,720
Set condition 1Sq.

1170
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:39,640
Spin up missiles

1171
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:42,320
for strategic launch.

1172
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,320
The use of nuclear weapons
has been authorized.

1173
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:46,280
This is the X.O.

1177
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,920

1181
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,720
Aye, sir.

1182
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:30,200
Look, it's not a mutiny.
I did everything by the book.

1183
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,680
It's not about the book.

1184
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:37,720
If the Russians are gonna launch
and we do nothing, who's gonna stop 'em?

1185
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:42,000
Half of me is glad the captain
came back. He could be right, you know.

1186
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:45,080
No orders are valid, Cob,
if they're wrong.

1187
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:48,200
- We don't know if they're wrong.
- That's true. We don't know.

1188
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:50,200
That's why we have
to find out first.

1189
01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:00,800
What if Radchenko surrendered
and it's over? Hmm?

1190
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:03,280
We launch. They see us.

1191
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,920
They launch.

in the air. Boom!

1193

- Nuclear war.

01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:14,280
Nuclear holocaust.

Come on. You know the drill.

an escort to take a shit?
- Shut up!

01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:49,440
- Mr. Rivetti, I'm impressed.
- I never liked him, sir.

1203
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:52,760
Rivetti, go to laundry. Get four sets
of coveralls and four caps.

- Don't worry about where I am.

You cannot proceed. We got other ships
out there that can handle this.

Don't do this.
Once you launch, they cannot come back.

They cannot come back, Weps.
And you know the repercussions

Get the radio fixed, Vossler.
I could have built one by now.

from personnel on board the Alabama...

and, in no small measure, to that
of the senior officer, Captain Ramsey...

my recommendations to SUBPAC.

1428
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:18,520
is the breakdown in the system.

1429
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:21,400
In this instance,
the system failed...

1430
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:26,200
because the two senior officers did not
work to resolve their differences...

Now you may have been
proven right, Mr. Hunter...

the letter of the law is concerned...

you were both right.

And you were also both wrong.

occupy this panel, this Navy...

as a whole...

nuclear submarine...

launch protocol.

1442
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:13,520
For the record, it is
the conclusion of this panel...

1443
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:16,440
that your actions
aboard the Alabama...

1444
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:19,280
were consistent with
the best traditions of the Navy...

1445
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:21,240
and in the interests
of the United States.

1446
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:26,000
As such, the recommendations
of this panel will be to accept...

1447
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:29,680
in a manner reflective of his long
and dedicated service to his country...

Captain Ramsey's request
for early retirement from active duty.

1449

And based, in no small part,
on Captain Ramsey's recommendation...

1450
01:44:40,760 --> 01:44:44,280
that Lieutenant Commander Hunter
be given his next command...
