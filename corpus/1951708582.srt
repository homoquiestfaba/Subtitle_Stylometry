1
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,598
Miz Kelty?

2
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:52,289
Miz Kelty?

3
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:32,797
You don't need me, Mr. Baring.
Just wasting my time again

4
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:37,438
You know where I am.
No square dancing!

5
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,173
Do you reckon he
ought to be in the hospital?

6
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:45,476
No, ma'am. My advice is

7
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:48,214
don't go near those places
unless they pay you a heap of money

8
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:53,447
Your father's eighty-seven years old, Janet.
Just be there for him

9
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,854
Don't worry,
I ain't a-gonna go nowhere

10
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,064
Been looking for you all over, Jerry

11
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,301
- Take care
- See ya

12
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,662
- Thanks for seeing Papa
- Sure

13
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:14,101
Billy Fisher found her.
He delivers the groceries out there

14
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,607
I guess she's what you'd call a hermit

15
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:24,951
She talked kinda funny, too.
She kinda like, uh, "Durr yurr mmm... "

16
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,959
Only one side of her face was working

17
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,290
You try talking out
of one side of your face

18
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,828
Oh, so you seen her then?

19
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:33,659
Just the once.
When I first moved out here

20
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,394
It seemed to me she was doing okay

21
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,230
Oh, sure now, she lived her own life

22
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,310
I didn't know there were
folks living this far out

23
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,748
Well, there aren't.
Just ol' Miz Kelty

24
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:04,186
God

25
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,028
It's beautiful

26
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,359
Well, look at that

27
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,437
Just laid herself down...
folded up her arms and died

28
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,935
Don't look like she's been gone long

29
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,033
No...

30
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,036
In this heat, you'd know
if she'd been dead more than a day

31
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,980
Well... anything
I should be concerned about?

32
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,210
Not that I can see

33
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,989
I guess she hasn't been
outside in a long time

34
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:35,225
Well, that figures. The last time I seen
her in town was more'n a year back

35
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,360
Is this for real?

36
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,532
No electricity, no phone...
no running water

37
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,883
She lived here all alone, huh?

38
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,214
Well, that's what hermits do, lovell

39
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,722
They live alone and they die alone

40
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,292
Peterson to Robbinsville base

41
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,037
Okay-ay-ay, we're outta here!

42
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,233
Let's get back to civilization

43
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,472
Billy Fisher found her when
he delivered the groceries?

44
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:31,808
Yeah, that's right

45
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,678
I'll catch up with you

46
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,477
Hi there

47
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,727
It's okay, I won't hurt you

48
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,238
- Stay back!
- Well, what the hell is it?

49
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,109
- Stay back!
- What the hell is it, Jerry?

50
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,873
- Put the gun away. Leave her alone
- Don't touch my gun, Jerry

51
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,506
- Come on, let's go. Come on
- What the hell is it?

52
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:13,643
- Get out. She's scared
- She's scared? Holy shit! What...?

53
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,320
Good God Almighty

54
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,858
You ever heard of
anyone else living out here?

55
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,791
No, never

56
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,193
- Are you all right? Did you get hurt?
- Fine. Fine

57
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,630
- Okay
- Jesus

58
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,971
Let's take this one step at a time.
Stay here. I'm gonna go back inside

59
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,211
Jerry, I can't let you go back in there.
We don't even know what that thing is

60
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,714
It's a human being.
And she's frightened

61
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,943
Well, what are you gonna do?

62
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,445
Talk to her. If I can

63
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,969
Please... don't be afraid

64
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:40,771
The Lord led you here, stranger.
Guard my Nell. Nell

65
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,033
Good child. the Lord care you

66
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:49,639
Man, did you see this? That crazy old
woman owned half of this damn woods

67
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,607
What kind a deal is this?

68
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,983
The first stranger who finds
her is supposed to look after her?

69
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,150
- Well, that means you, Jer
- Oh, sure. Just what I need

70
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,683
Well, "the Lord led you here".
There you go

71
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:00,848
You led me here

72
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,489
Well, you want the Lord
to take care of you or not?

73
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:09,232
The last time I saw the Lord
was in church on my wedding day.

74
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,133
And look how that turned out. Come on

75
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,339
Well, she's definitely over age

76
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:19,108
So I guess we notify
the Adult Protective Service

77
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:23,137
She doesn't need a social worker.
She needs a padded call

78
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,741
That is one seriously disturbed lady

79
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,121
Well, I'm afraid that's
gonna be your territory, Jerry

80
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:31,615
Thanks

81
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,319
Well, "the Lord led you here, stranger"

82
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:47,863
It's okay. It's okay. It's all right,
just calm yourself down. It's okay

83
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,441
Calm down, calm down

84
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,505
It's all right calm down.

85
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,850
No! Whackie!

86
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,944
No. Calm down

87
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:02,976
Come in

88
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,990
Nicole, you want to sing
"Open/Shut" then?

89
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:06,958
Doctor Olsen?

90
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,485
Could you close the door, please?
Thanks

91
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,960
They said it was fine to drop by

92
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,899
I'm Jerry Lovell. I've got a family
practice over in Robbinsville

93
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,093
Hi

94
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,770
This is my assistant, Diane

95
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,240
So what can I do for you?

96
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,277
Well... I could use some advice

97
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,556
This, uh, this woman speaks
an unknown language?

98
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:46,923
Her mother was paralysed down one side.
Apparently a series of strokes

99
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:50,335
It's possible the girl picked up
the speech distortions

100
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,596
Speech distortion's not
an unknown language

101
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,066
I know. It's more than that

102
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,574
Well, I want to see her right away

103
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,507
How about first thing
in the morning? Nine?

104
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,645
Thanks. If you're not too busy

105
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,949
Well, no known living next of kin

106
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:18,754
Violet Kelty was just about
as lone as a soul can get in this world

107
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,259
- Hmm. Except she wasn't
- Sheriff's Department

108
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:24,057
Well, now officially that
"creature" does not exist

109
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,330
Todd?

110
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,129
There, see what you make of that

111
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:32,367
Right here?

112
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,203
Perterson

113
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:39,506
Yeah, hey, Sally, what...

114
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:44,743
Where is she now?

115
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,178
I'll be right over.

116
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,081
Yeah, thanks, Sally,
I appreciate your trouble

117
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,088
You think that's how
she got pregnant? Rape?

118
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:55,290
I have to go

119
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,418
- Mary, huh?
- Yeah

120
00:14:58,631 --> 00:14:59,598
My Mary

121
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,946
You'll be all right now, honey.
He's on his way. He's a-coming

122
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,377
Thanks, Sally

123
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:26,247
It's okay, sweetheart.
It's okay. I'm here now

124
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,557
Why'd you get upset?

125
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:30,754
Hey!

126
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,935
Come on... come on.
There you go

127
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,806
Okay, folks, the show's over

128
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:49,344
- You guys okay?
- Yeah, yeah. We've been here before

129
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:54,875
Hi

130
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:58,513
You found me

131
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:00,458
Early

132
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,959
Yeah, I'm always early

133
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,250
Not a bad day

134
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,291
What happened to her?

135
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:06,924
Nothing and everything

136
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,031
It hits her once in a while

137
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,533
- Is there any obvious cause?
- You want a list? Life's touch

138
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:19,710
But she's luckier than some.
She's got a good husband there

139
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,004
Ready to head for the woods?

140
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,250
The things people
do to their kids. Jesus

141
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,259
She's not like that
when she's on her own

142
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,254
Strangers scare her

143
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:11,827
How do you know?

144
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,824
I've been watching her

145
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:23,604
She's been, uh, completely isolated.
Almost certainly mentally retarded

146
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:27,133
A blood test will pick up childhood
disease, any kind of metabolic disorder

147
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,905
Oh, you carry a blood kit?

148
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,747
You think she's gonna sit there
and let me stick a needle in her?

149
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,189
I'll hold her

150
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:44,225
It's okay, darling. It's okay

151
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,220
Do it

152
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,107
Do it

153
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:11,049
Shh... shh. It's okay

154
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,922
If you're right... a big if...

155
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:18,629
if she's never left this cabin
or this part of the forest

156
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,231
never known anybody but her mother...

157
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,931
never encountered any of
the images of the modern world,

158
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:27,334
never seen a car,
a television a gun, a Hershey bar...

159
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:31,436
never heard rock'n'roll music or
But now you said she can talk

160
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,903
Yeah, but it's some kinda
language of her own

161
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:37,782
Well, we haven't had a true wild child
in this country for sixty years

162
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,584
She's not a wild child

163
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:41,880
It's just a shorthand term, Dr. Lovell

164
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,987
She's not a child

165
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,984
No. That's what makes
this case so unique

166
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,583
This is not your field, I know

167
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,560
Bur let me tell you
what we're dealing with here

168
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,095
Some pretty fundamental issues

169
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,193
How was the personality formed?
We don't know

170
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,196
How much is innate,
how much is learned? We don't know

171
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,034
Where do gender roles come from?
We don't know

172
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,903
Because you can't take a baby
and have it grow up in a lab...

173
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:07,036
- and monitor and control every influence...
- You want to have her grow up in a lab?

174
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,512
Grow up in a lab? No

175
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:14,677
Dr. Lovell thinks you're gonna do
a Frankenstein number on her, Al

176
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,881
Oh, well, uh... all right...

177
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,886
Let me ask you this, Dr. Lovell

178
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,626
Can she survive on her own?

179
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,226
Well

180
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:27,463
I don't know

181
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,227
Yeah, well, all right,
suppose she cannot

182
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,362
Who's gonna look after her? You?

183
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,262
Me? Why me?

184
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,065
All right, so who's volunteering?

185
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,835
I can tell you this much

186
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,172
It's gonna be somebody
with an ulterior motive

187
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:44,407
Everybody who cares for
someone has an ulterior motive

188
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,177
Even Mother Teresa

189
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,454
She wants to know that her life
has been of some use to others

190
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,020
And so do I

191
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,415
Excuse me

192
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,713
Oh, shit

193
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,818
Yeah, I'm on my way

194
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,222
Well, Lovell, did I wake you up?

195
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,764
Hey, Todd, it's okay.
I overslept. What's up?

196
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:47,136
I'm looking at a commitment order
that's just been issued for Nell

197
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:50,999
What does that mean?

198
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,109
Well, it means they're
gonna take her away

199
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,114
It's a court order, Jerry.
I have to enforce it

200
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:58,446
When, now?

201
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,073
Well, that's what it says

202
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,180
Can you give me some time?

203
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:08,018
- I guess I could hold off till after lunch
- Try and make it a long lunch, will ya?

204
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,210
Well, what do you say there, Don?

205
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,312
Not fishing today?

206
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:35,518
Todd

207
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,387
Sorry about this, Jerry?

208
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:42,517
Hi

209
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:46,291
Well, we've...
come to pick Nell up

210
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:47,730
Yeah, I heard

211
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,500
I've got the court order

212
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:58,241
You do know it's in her
own best interests right?

213
00:22:58,643 --> 00:22:59,610
Did you ask her?

214
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:03,070
Well, you know that's impossible

215
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:05,483
Tell 'em, Don

216
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:08,309
Well, I have a court order
here that says...

217
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:12,553
if you don't get Nell's informed consent,
you're violatin' her rights

218
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:15,890
And if you do that, I'm gonna sue
you all the way to the Supreme Court

219
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,730
How can she give
her informed consent?

220
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,200
She doesn't even speak English!

221
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:31,809
If she doesn't speak English, she has to
give her consent through an interpreter

222
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,674
What interpreter? This is crazy!

223
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,008
There isn't anybody
who speaks her language!

224
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,644
Then I guess somebody's
gonna have to learn

225
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:03,440
Dr. Lovell's view seems to be that
this woman's natural habitat is...

226
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:07,536
a primitive cabin in the heart of
the forest. Well, I take a different view

227
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:12,472
I see... a victim of abuse... and neglect...

228
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:15,953
I see a mature woman who's
been robbed of half her life

229
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:21,149
Her mother never gave her a choice.
Isn't Dr. Lovell doing the same thing?

230
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,157
Hiding her away as his own
private pet in the woods?

231
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,858
We all know what happens to
these freak cases, Your Honor

232
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,530
They get a year of celebrity

233
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,369
A starring role in
a few academic papers

234
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:36,199
Then they get to spend the rest of
their lives in a state institution...

235
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:41,111
abandoned... by the very doctors and
scientists who claimed to be helping them

236
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:46,774
Nell has a home. She has a life.
She's not asking for any help

237
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:52,218
So just be sure she needs care...
before she gets cared to death

238
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:54,591
If she's ever gonna leave that cabin

239
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,093
she's gonna need skills
she doesn't presently possess

240
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,924
How do you know
she wants to leave the cabin?

241
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,056
You think that's the best
life we can give her?

242
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:01,827
I don't think her life is ours to give

243
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,733
People can help each other, Dr. Lovell. We
don't have to do everything on our own

244
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,464
Okay, I think I'm getting the picture

245
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:08,936
Here's what I'm gonna do

246
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,999
I'm gonna defer my decision
for three months

247
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:15,876
This time to be used for the proposed
of observation and assessment

248
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:20,046
And I hope that by the end of this period,
this court is better informed

249
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,315
Hey

250
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,375
You sure you can make it,
roughing it like this?

251
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,450
I don't see an air conditioning unit

252
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,289
You okay about breathing raw air?

253
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:11,199
Wow, who's paying for
this floating palace?

254
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,364
My department.
This project has very high priority

255
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:15,965
Oh, I bet it does

256
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,037
So how long are you staying?

257
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,113
Three months

258
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,210
Don't you have a life?

259
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:28,986
It can wait

260
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:32,421
How long're you staying?

261
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:34,859
I don't know

262
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,620
Well, won't your, uh, patient miss you?

263
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:40,324
I've got someone to cover for me.
Everybody's replaceable

264
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:45,634
so I guess you'll make full professor
on the back of this case, huh?

265
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,029
Sure, why not?

266
00:26:54,713 --> 00:27:00,242
Look, I'm here to do ajob. Anything
that helps me do thatjob is fine by me

267
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:02,316
If you want to be a Boy Scout, go ahead...

268
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,547
but I'd appreciate it if you could
do your best not to screw it up

269
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:18,871
What's all this?

270
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:24,051
What's it look like?

271
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,383
You never said anything
about video cameras to me

272
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:29,189
Well, it's the least
intrusive method of observation

273
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,592
Well, how'd you rig this up?

274
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,793
Well, she was asleep.
She sleeps most of the day

275
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:40,297
Mind if I dress?

276
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:14,962
Hi

277
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:20,311
I'm Jerry

278
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:35,525
You're Nell. I'm Jerry

279
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,157
Me

280
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,655
Me. That's right. Jerry

281
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,396
You're Nell

282
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,771
That's right. That's right

283
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,680
That's right

284
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:21,490
She has an objective self
and a subjective self that I

285
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,789
I've never seen such a
perfect projection before

286
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,761
That's, that's "me"...
me... in the mirror

287
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,162
You'd think it would be
the other way around

288
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:32,100
But that's "me" out there.
almost like she's displacing herself

289
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,728
Have you run any tests?

290
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:37,367
Only blood works,
and no abnormalities there

291
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,172
We'll have to run competency
tests before the court hearing, but...

292
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,607
I'd say it's still too soon

293
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:45,843
I want you to hear
this language she speaks

294
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:47,578
What is this gesture about?

295
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:51,718
I don't know.
It's some kind of self comforting

296
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,689
She did it when
she was saying "me"

297
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,223
You should explain the speech
degradation is misleading

298
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:01,256
That's right.
the mother was aphasic

299
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:05,892
but the idiosyncratic word
forms... you tell me

300
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,610
Incredible

301
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:58,084
You mind if I talk?

302
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,585
I like it here

303
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:07,257
It's a quiet place

304
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,062
You've got the right idea, Nell

305
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,734
You live with people,
you get problems

306
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:17,238
First they screw you up...

307
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:20,042
then they leave you, right?

308
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:27,350
You ever get lonely, Nell?

309
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,592
I never had any brothers
and sisters either

310
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:40,125
"Very unusual for
an Irish family, Dr. Lovell"

311
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:41,825
Oh, sure, you better believe it.

312
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,598
God, there was a family
lived next door.

313
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:49,704
The Connors. The Connors...
They had seven kids. Seven

314
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:53,109
Always yelling and screaming,
having a good time

315
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:55,145
Me watching...

316
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,277
over a fence, through a window

317
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,078
I heard music. A band

318
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:04,887
This parade was
coming down the street

319
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,818
I'm on our front steps

320
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:09,651
Jamie Connor grabs me
pulling me into the street

321
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:13,590
"No, no, no, no, no" My heart's
going ba-boom, ba- boom, ba-boom

322
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:17,289
The band's going bum-bum-bum,
bam, bam-bam-bam, bam.

323
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:21,669
Oh, but I was so excited.
Jamie's got me by my hand

324
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:26,071
We're doing this. Some kid's got my
other hand, the band right behind us

325
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,281
You get close to a band.
you know about it

326
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:39,454
I'm marching, I'm with the other kids.
I wasn't alone

327
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,550
You know what I'm saying?

328
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,217
We weren't talking

329
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:49,290
Just... just... enjoying
this wonderful spirit

330
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:16,511
Did you see that?

331
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:17,721
- Yeah, I saw it
- Did you see it?

332
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,188
- Yeah, I saw it
- She talked! To me!

333
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:20,689
- I know
- Hold out your hand

334
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:23,892
- I didn't ask for that. She did
- I know

335
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,828
- You know what it means?
- No!

336
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:34,032
Okay, so here's what I've been thinking.
Nell speaks English

337
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,366
English? Oh, come on

338
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,474
Yeah, most of the time anyway. Look

339
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:39,906
Come here. Take a look at this.

340
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:45,012
"Af'ah I done go, ga'inja come" There's
only one word of pure Nellish there

341
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:46,514
Sounds like language
analysis to me

342
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,074
- Dr. Olsen
- All right, o- okay

343
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,947
"Spee"... speak. "Af'ah"... after.
She's droppin' consonants

344
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:54,617
Yeah, but... what does "chickabee" mean?

345
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:57,286
She says, "Missa chickabee. "
What's "missa"?

346
00:39:58,863 --> 00:39:59,989
I don't know

347
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:03,733
When she's scared she says. "Tata, tata"
Wh-what's that?

348
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:05,393
I don't know yet

349
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:09,403
Where is she?

350
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,491
Look at that

351
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,798
- We shouldn't be watching this
- Why not?

352
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:17,265
She's naked

353
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:19,199
So?

354
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,668
I think she's beautiful

355
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:29,047
You think I'm planning to abuse
the doctor patient relationship?

356
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:32,453
- Are you?
- No

357
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:37,490
Just because I think she's beautiful
doesn't mean I want to have sex with her

358
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:39,796
I mean, I think you're beautiful, but...

359
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,132
Oh, thanks

360
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:43,366
You know what I mean

361
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:45,231
That's okay

362
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:49,897
- No, look, I didn't mean it that...
- It's okay. I'm a big girl

363
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,116
What is it with you and Nell?

364
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:09,816
It's like...

365
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:13,423
there's no one else in the world

366
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:21,397
Like she doesn't... need anybody

367
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,237
Can you live your
whole life that way or...

368
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:33,579
does it drive you crazy in the end?

369
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,981
I don't understand, Nell.
What, what's "missa"?

370
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:55,024
Oh, I've got it! "Missa"... little

371
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:59,027
Little. "Erna"... big. Huh?

372
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:01,364
So, so what's "t'ee"?

373
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:15,317
"T'ee"... tree. "Tree in the wind!"
You're a tree in the wind!

374
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:20,315
Hey, Nell, Nell.
Show me "t'ee"

375
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:22,354
Come on, show me "t'ee. "
Show me the trees

376
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,251
Come on, Nell, it'll be fun

377
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:26,152
Come on, we'll have fun

378
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:28,865
- Tata!
- Tata?

379
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:29,863
Tata!

380
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,501
Tata. What...? Tata? You're afraid?

381
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:36,304
What are you afraid of, Nell?

382
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,678
What's "eva'dur"?

383
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,342
You okay?

384
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:30,017
"Missa"... little

385
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:31,755
"Erna"... big

386
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,790
"Tata"... potato. Just kidding

387
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:39,096
Frightened... "tata"...
frightened. "T'ee"... "tree"

388
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:41,563
Hey

389
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:49,036
Well, how long has she been there?

390
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:42,258
Turn if off

391
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,908
Turn that thing off!

392
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:54,835
What the hell do
you think you're doing?

393
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:56,845
She's never heard
music before in her life

394
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,677
- Hey sometimes people just do things!
- Did you think of that?

395
00:46:58,882 --> 00:46:59,974
It's called impulse

396
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:02,517
- It's called doing what you want...
- You ought to try it some time!

397
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:04,917
whenever you want to and
not giving a shit about anyone else!

398
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:07,286
And I grew out of it
around about the age of six!

399
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:56,368
What the fuck is that?

400
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:01,875
What's wrong?

401
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:06,071
What... what's gone away?

402
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:14,552
Ah... word of the Lord.
I'll get it. I'll get it!

403
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:16,250
It's safe

404
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,634
I'm sorry.
We shouldn't have taken it away

405
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:46,785
You want... you want
me to read it to you, huh?

406
00:48:57,567 --> 00:49:04,166
a people... laden with iniquity,
a seed of evildoers

407
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:06,503
children that are corrupters...

408
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,968
they have forsaken the Lord

409
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:13,080
They have provoked the...

410
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,740
Eva'dur...

411
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:19,249
A seed of evildoers

412
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:21,181
Nell

413
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:22,423
Nell

414
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,354
Show me "eva'dur. "

415
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:30,598
Nell

416
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,059
Nell?

417
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,605
Nell. Nell

418
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:40,270
Show me "eva'dur. " Show me

419
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:42,635
Show me "eva'dur. "

420
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:00,954
It's okay

421
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:21,945
Nell, Nell... the "eva'dur"
hits you like this, huh?

422
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:25,711
Skoo'? "Skoo" in the belly?

423
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:26,688
Skoo'!

424
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:28,124
Skoo'?

425
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:43,670
Well, suppose your only close encounter
with men was terrifying violence?

426
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:47,239
Rape. You'd tell your daughter
they were monsters. Evil-doers

427
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,638
- "Eva'dur. "
- My God, of course!

428
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:53,308
You'd want to warn her what they do.
I think Violet told Nell about rape

429
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:54,674
Sure. but how?

430
00:50:56,553 --> 00:51:01,252
"Skoo' inna belly. "
Knife in the belly. Pardon me

431
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:03,123
Skewer

432
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:05,621
- Nell told you that?
- Yep

433
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:08,429
Well, that could be all that's keeping
her from coming out in the daytime

434
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,499
A deliberately-implanted phobia

435
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:12,860
And why is she more likely
to be raped in the daytime?

436
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,633
Well, she isn't, but she's more
likely to be seen in the daytime

437
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:17,668
And... Violet didn't
want anyone to see Nell

438
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:19,265
Yep. I buy that

439
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:22,172
So...

440
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:26,148
what do we do with phobics?
Get them to face what they're afraid of

441
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,274
Neutralize their fear

442
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:33,890
We could do that

443
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:43,430
Hey. Uh-uh. not so fast

444
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:47,168
- You're a man. You're an "eva'dur"
- Wait a minute, no, I'm not

445
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:51,571
Ye-yes, I'm a, I'm a man.
I'm g-, I'm "ga'inja"!

446
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:53,941
Ga'inja

447
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:59,046
Guardian angel!
I'm her guardian angel!

448
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:03,278
Well, that's great.
Now you have to help

449
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:12,218
Je'y!

450
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,434
Come on.
I want you right here beside me

451
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:24,403
- You want a chaperone?
- For the record. Come on

452
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:26,309
Okay

453
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:37,911
Okay

454
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:40,714
Now's as good a time as any

455
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:50,391
- Do I warn her, or what?
- Just do it. Act like it's no big deal

456
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:52,796
Believe me, it's no big deal

457
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:00,765
Turn around

458
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:51,357
He won't hurt you

459
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,222
Who's Tirzah?

460
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:17,738
Good, huh?

461
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:34,118
Je'y!

462
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:35,621
What, Nell?

463
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,358
These?

464
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:44,797
Come and get it

465
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:47,775
Come on

466
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,583
- Je'y!
- What, Nell?

467
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,423
Well, come on nobody's
gonna hurt you

468
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:08,223
Come and get some

469
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,470
See? No evil-doers. Just me

470
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:30,852
Come on. scaredy. Come on!

471
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:34,587
Well, what was you
doing back in that barn?

472
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:40,558
The Wild Woman of Lake Coweeta!

473
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,695
- Well, what kind of wild?
- She was like an animal

474
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:52,598
- She ain't got no clothes on?
- Butt fucking naked!

475
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:56,174
And she does like a dog

476
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:11,119
Hey, how are you doing?

477
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:15,820
What's going on?

478
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:23,228
You say you was sawing
the wild woman in the wood

479
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,410
And what if I did?

480
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:39,418
- Well, I'd be interested
- Well, I'd be interested

481
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:45,920
What's it called?

482
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:47,519
Pop what?

483
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,621
- Popcorn, Je'y
- Popcorn

484
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,400
- What are you doing?
- Getting her out in the daytime

485
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:02,267
- She's not a dog, for crissakes
- It works, doesn't it?

486
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:04,445
- Well, yeah, but...
- She's having a good time

487
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,673
She's discovered popcorn
Now she can go to the movies!

488
00:58:08,284 --> 00:58:09,114
Nell?

489
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:12,277
Nay tata. Reckon?

490
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:40,473
Oh, I knew she'd like it

491
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:51,551
T'ee... t'ee in the way!

492
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:11,711
T'ee... t'ee in the way!

493
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:16,978
Whoops

494
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:51,279
Nell!

495
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,338
Nell!

496
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:18,270
Damn it!

497
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:22,278
Je'y?

498
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:25,149
Come loo' Mi'i!

499
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:28,390
Where is "Mi'i", Nell?

500
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:31,022
Mi'i inna missa feliss

501
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:33,384
Missa feliss?

502
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:34,964
Come on

503
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,807
Nell

504
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:48,569
Oh, my God

505
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:53,604
Mi'i!

506
01:00:56,586 --> 01:00:57,712
Mi'i?

507
01:00:59,188 --> 01:01:01,122
"Mi'i" walks with the Lord

508
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,084
"Mi'i" walks with the Lord

509
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:06,585
The Lord!

510
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,029
Lor-d

511
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:12,790
That's it

512
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:24,480
Reckon

513
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:42,357
She's the survivor
of a pair of identical twins

514
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:45,798
That's where the private language
comes from. It's twin-speech

515
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:48,065
- And this repetitive gesture?
- You got it

516
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:50,698
So, how long ago did the twin die?

517
01:01:51,074 --> 01:01:55,977
Well, I'd guess the age of between six and
ten. We're looking at twenty years at least

518
01:01:56,612 --> 01:01:59,638
We want her in here, Paulajust
as soon as the court hearing's over

519
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:03,512
Jerry thinks she
should be left where she is

520
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:06,654
- Jerry?
- Dr. Lovell

521
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:10,689
You know, Al, Nell has her
own way of doing things

522
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,491
I'd say she can probably
handle it on her own

523
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:20,227
Let me give you a little,
uh, peek into the future, Paula

524
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:24,404
One day soon some... hiker or
fisherman is gonna come walking...

525
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:26,839
out of those woods with
a story about a wild woman

526
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:31,278
And, uh, that'll bring the news reporters.
The news reports will bring the crowds

527
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:35,373
The crowds will bring the talk show hosts.
Nell will find she's hired a lawyer...

528
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:38,209
an agent, a manager,
and three bodyguards

529
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:40,448
You think she can handle that?

530
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:01,869
Hello?

531
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:04,776
Anybody home?

532
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:10,811
Hello?

533
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:16,619
Anybody home?

534
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:45,413
Hi

535
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:53,056
Mike Ibarra. I'm ajournalist.
Charlotte Tribune

536
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:57,289
Um... I heard you were living up here

537
01:03:58,267 --> 01:04:00,701
Well, I, I hope you
don't mind me coming by

538
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:06,464
Look, is, uh... it okay if I...
I take a picture?

539
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:15,050
Have you ever seen
one of these before?

540
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,653
It, It's called a camera, see, and...

541
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:22,121
um, uhh, I look at you... through
this little window here, see? Now...

542
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,953
I'm looking at you through this...
window, and, uh...

543
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:29,588
Hey, no, come on, it's okay.
Really. It's okay...

544
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:35,302
You hurt her, you're dead, buddy!

545
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:37,829
Look, I never touched her!
All I did was take her picture

546
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:42,240
You press?

547
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:44,506
Charlotte Tribune

548
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:50,846
Okay. I'm sorry.
I guess I overreacted

549
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:55,720
Look, I'm her doctor. Do me a favor,
will ya? Forget you ever met her

550
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:58,518
Mike Ibarra

551
01:04:59,862 --> 01:05:00,760
Lovell

552
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:03,996
Well, it's like this, Dr. Lovell

553
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:05,956
I'm a newsman

554
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:10,432
Yeah, well find some other news.
You saw how you scared her

555
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,781
Nell? You okay?

556
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:29,191
- Nell?
- She's called Nell?

557
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:37,663
She's called Nell?
She's called Nell?!

558
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:41,703
Why can't she just be left alone
to live as she damn well pleases?

559
01:05:41,837 --> 01:05:45,398
You know why. Once word gets out,
we might as well start selling tickets

560
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:48,108
So what do we do, huh?
Build a wall around the woods?

561
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:50,971
Well, maybe she's gonna
have to go somewhere else

562
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:55,851
- Like where?
- Somewhere where she can be protected

563
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:57,977
Like a psychiatric unit, maybe?

564
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:00,918
So what's your suggestion?
Check her into a Holiday Inn?

565
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:03,755
Al Paley's the best man in the field

566
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,159
Great. Let him stay in his field.
Nell doesn't need him

567
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:09,091
- So who does she need? You?
- She could do worse

568
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:12,232
Well, what have you got to offer?
What's your big plan for Nell?

569
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:15,998
I don't make plans. That's your game.
Yours and Al's

570
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:18,364
Go play it somewhere else,
and leave us out of it

571
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:21,205
Oh, it's "us" now, is it?
Jerry and Nell, the happy couple?

572
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,035
What would you
know about happy couples?

573
01:06:24,613 --> 01:06:26,376
Well, what would you know about Nell?

574
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:30,615
I've spent more time
with her than you have

575
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:32,677
Oh, yeah, I noticed

576
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:34,918
What's that supposed to mean?

577
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:38,292
You ever ask yourself why you
like hanging around Nell so much?

578
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:41,655
- Great! Here we go again!
- She's not exactly a grown woman, is she?

579
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:44,494
- Not exactly a threat. Doesn't make any demands.
- You want to know what you problem is?

580
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:46,125
- I'll tell you what your problem is
- Just what every man wants!

581
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:47,396
- You're the big expert on men, right?
- You're not a man

582
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:49,427
- You're just a biob!
- What'd you do, read a book about it?

583
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:54,641
God!

584
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:58,236
Okay, Nell. It's okay

585
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:01,009
Nell, Nell, Nell.
It's okay, it's okay. Nell

586
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:06,816
Say something.
Make her feel it's okay

587
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:27,005
Mommy loves Daddy, really

588
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:52,764
Whatever I said back there...

589
01:07:54,136 --> 01:07:56,001
I'm sorry, I was just sounding off

590
01:07:56,138 --> 01:07:57,935
- It's okay
- What do I know?

591
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,810
So what are we gonna do about Nell?

592
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:13,785
She's gonna have to take some kinda
competency test before a court hearing

593
01:08:13,823 --> 01:08:15,791
Those tests don't prove a...

594
01:08:18,227 --> 01:08:19,159
I know

595
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:32,231
It's time to show her the big bad world
and see how she handles it

596
01:08:44,353 --> 01:08:46,583
Okay. Hold still

597
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:50,788
Loo', Je'y. Jus' like Pau'

598
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:30,458
Slow down

599
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:15,306
It's all right. It's noisy, though

600
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:44,433
Mommy

601
01:10:57,519 --> 01:10:58,747
This is it, Nell

602
01:11:00,155 --> 01:11:02,123
- Well, what do you say, Jerry?
- Hi, Todd

603
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:04,551
You know Doctor Olsen

604
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,887
- Oh, yeah. Hi
- Hey, how you doing?

605
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:09,896
- Well, look at this
- Nell this is Sheriff Peterson

606
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,825
Uh, welcome to Robbinsville

607
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:15,269
So how are you guys doing,
Todd? Okay?

608
01:11:15,971 --> 01:11:20,305
- Ah, well quiet. Uh, I've known worse
- Hi, Mary?

609
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:27,211
Hi. All this is kinda new to her

610
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:28,974
You scared?

611
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:32,852
You scared?

612
01:11:33,155 --> 01:11:34,986
Well, you sleeping pretty
good up there in the mountains?

613
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:36,819
I'm not as young as I used to be

614
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:41,828
Well, we better get on home. Uh, looks
like you're doing good work there, Jerry

615
01:11:41,997 --> 01:11:43,021
Just starting

616
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:57,531
I'm not getting her this

617
01:12:57,573 --> 01:13:00,474
She hasn't eaten junk like this yet,
and I'm not having her start now

618
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:02,443
Don't you remember
eating candy as a kid?

619
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:05,808
Saturday mornings, tearing
the wrapper off a Milky Way?

620
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:09,281
The first explosion of total sweetness?
Life doesn't get any better

621
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:11,485
- Right, Hazel?
- Yes

622
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:15,221
- You still got all your own teeth?
- Yeah, mostly

623
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:17,657
Wher2's Nell?

624
01:13:20,362 --> 01:13:21,420
Nell?

625
01:13:22,097 --> 01:13:22,654
Nell?

626
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,189
Nell?

627
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:31,571
Nell?

628
01:14:09,478 --> 01:14:10,502
Jim!

629
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:12,909
We got us a wild woman

630
01:14:14,683 --> 01:14:16,150
Flesh and blood

631
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:21,350
Well, what does she want anyway?

632
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:26,025
Well, I tell ya,
I believe she wants a little action

633
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:28,452
Get going, Billy

634
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:36,262
Hi there, baby

635
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:40,837
Anything I can do ya for?

636
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:54,287
Now, you'll have to excuse me.
Just correct me if I'm wrong here

637
01:14:54,423 --> 01:14:56,391
Miss... Miss Wild Thing, but you

638
01:14:58,293 --> 01:15:00,625
you don't understand
a word I'm saying, do you?

639
01:15:02,431 --> 01:15:03,363
That's right

640
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:10,571
You don't understand
a word that I'm saying, do you?

641
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,298
That's right

642
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:15,836
And it's getting a little bit
hot in here, Jim

643
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:19,871
Why don't you just light my fire?

644
01:15:21,316 --> 01:15:24,877
You light my fire darling, that's right
Oh, that's it

645
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,213
You want, you wanna
show me something?

646
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:32,516
You, you want to show me them tit...?
Them are titties. Can you say "titties"?

647
01:15:33,462 --> 01:15:36,431
Tit-, titties? Titties?

648
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:41,296
That's right, shake 'em up.
That's right, turn all about, right

649
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:45,462
That's a girl. Turn all around,
do the titty dance

650
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:51,770
That's right. Hey! I got an idea. You
want to see my body? What you want?

651
01:15:57,386 --> 01:16:00,014
Whoo, titties! Titties!

652
01:16:00,622 --> 01:16:04,956
Let's do the titty dance!
You put your left titty...

653
01:16:05,193 --> 01:16:11,189
Put your right titty... No, no...
Put your right titty in...

654
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:14,693
Nell?

655
01:16:16,338 --> 01:16:17,305
Nell!

656
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,577
What's going on here?

657
01:16:29,685 --> 01:16:31,516
What'd you do to her?!
What'd you do to her?!

658
01:16:31,553 --> 01:16:34,522
There don't have to be no ass-whupping.
You just take a look right over here

659
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,057
She's just crazy.

660
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:05,244
Nell, come on. Shh-shh-shh, Nell.
Shh. Come on. let's go, let's go

661
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:39,445
- She still looking at it?
- Yeah

662
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:46,184
Did your parents do this for you?

663
01:17:48,363 --> 01:17:52,197
You gotta be kidding me. My mother'd
die before she'd give me a book like that

664
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:54,135
No way. Uh-uh

665
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:56,293
So how'd you learn?

666
01:17:58,607 --> 01:18:00,734
Go on. Tell Dr. Lovell

667
01:18:03,645 --> 01:18:04,907
Girlfriends at school

668
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:10,443
So what about you?

669
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:18,849
- Well
- Come on, don't be shy. Come on

670
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:20,492
Bathroom walls

671
01:18:20,562 --> 01:18:22,462
- Bathroom walls?
- Je'y?

672
01:18:23,465 --> 01:18:24,397
Nell?

673
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:26,025
How yo' caw this?

674
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:38,505
Well making love

675
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:45,481
- Je'y?
- Well, not exactly

676
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:49,514
Pau'?

677
01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:53,926
Yeah, that's right.
That's Jerry and Paula

678
01:19:04,973 --> 01:19:07,635
Making love

679
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:58,684
It has to help Nell if we look on
as if we're getting along

680
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:02,287
That's why I let her identify us with
the pictures. I hope you don't mind

681
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:03,695
Nope

682
01:20:04,499 --> 01:20:09,493
Research shows that children who perceive
their parents as having a good sex life...

683
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:12,972
grow up to make far better
sexual relationships themselves

684
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:15,106
Is that so?

685
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:17,943
Yeah, that's so

686
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:26,587
Did your parents have a good sex life?

687
01:20:27,789 --> 01:20:28,756
Three guesses

688
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:32,816
What went wrong?

689
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:37,364
My daddy left home
when I was thirteen

690
01:20:38,733 --> 01:20:40,325
My mom still doesn't know why

691
01:20:41,136 --> 01:20:43,900
She was always laughing and smiling

692
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:47,099
We were all supposed to be
having such a good time

693
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:54,008
My dad liked happy people,
and so she was happy for him

694
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:58,712
She was so hurt. Shit

695
01:21:01,256 --> 01:21:02,553
You know what I hate?

696
01:21:04,426 --> 01:21:05,723
The way we're all

697
01:21:08,463 --> 01:21:12,490
we're all trapped in these cycles,
going around and around

698
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:26,942
I doesn't seem to me like
you're repeating the same pattern

699
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:33,578
Oh, sure. I'm just playing the flip side,
right? Nobody's gonna hurt me, so...

700
01:21:34,155 --> 01:21:35,281
so I don't...

701
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:38,283
I don't feel that much

702
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:40,956
Even when I want to

703
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:44,260
Shit!

704
01:22:06,955 --> 01:22:11,153
Nell, wha...?
Is anything the matter?

705
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:14,320
An'thin' a' matter?

706
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:18,231
An'thin' a' matter?

707
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,349
Donana kee

708
01:22:42,691 --> 01:22:44,420
I'm not, I'm not crying

709
01:23:04,946 --> 01:23:07,210
Oh, hell. Yes, I am

710
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:51,781
Paula?

711
01:23:56,498 --> 01:23:57,522
Paula?

712
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:00,191
You okay?

713
01:24:00,668 --> 01:24:01,532
Fine

714
01:24:31,299 --> 01:24:32,266
You wanna come?

715
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:37,270
Well, it's a pretty walk

716
01:24:41,709 --> 01:24:46,203
I just saw a T.V. news outfit in town.
It's not gonna take 'em long

717
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:47,574
Listen to this

718
01:24:47,816 --> 01:24:52,048
"The wild woman never spent a dollar
in her life, but she's worth millions"

719
01:24:52,587 --> 01:24:53,952
Where do they get this shit?

720
01:24:56,191 --> 01:24:57,749
We have to get her outta here

721
01:25:04,165 --> 01:25:05,257
The hospital

722
01:25:07,702 --> 01:25:10,398
You know it's the only place
where they can't get to her

723
01:26:13,868 --> 01:26:16,564
Get away!
Get those cameras the hell outta here!

724
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:21,399
Get away!

725
01:26:27,382 --> 01:26:29,873
Let her go, Mary. We have to go

726
01:26:33,154 --> 01:26:37,648
Nell, listen to me, Listen to me, Nell.
We have to leave! Just for a while

727
01:26:37,926 --> 01:26:42,659
Nell. I know you're scared... but I'll be
with you, I'll keep you safe. I promise

728
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:46,861
Nell... Jerry ga'inja

729
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:52,104
- Je'y ga'inja
- That's right. Come on,

730
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:53,837
Come on, we have to leave

731
01:26:54,142 --> 01:26:56,007
Okay? All right

732
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,189
Hold on

733
01:28:37,345 --> 01:28:38,334
Excuse me

734
01:28:41,949 --> 01:28:44,315
Almost there.
We're almost there

735
01:29:00,401 --> 01:29:03,928
Nell. Nell. Nell.
It's okay. Nell

736
01:29:09,444 --> 01:29:10,877
You'll have to carry her

737
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:16,506
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right...

738
01:29:17,485 --> 01:29:18,417
It's all right... it's all right, Nell

739
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:32,932
It's all right... Nell

740
01:29:35,737 --> 01:29:36,829
It's all right... Nell!

741
01:29:41,509 --> 01:29:42,669
Nell!

742
01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:48,242
All right, all right, now let us take her.
Easy, easy, easy

743
01:29:48,616 --> 01:29:50,447
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, easy, wait!
Come on...

744
01:29:53,454 --> 01:29:54,853
Back off! Back off!

745
01:29:58,826 --> 01:30:01,624
- Settle down, everybody, quiet!
- No sedatives

746
01:30:01,662 --> 01:30:02,651
We don't... want to set
the whole ward off here

747
01:30:02,697 --> 01:30:05,359
You can go in to see her
just as soon as you're... quiet

748
01:30:18,012 --> 01:30:20,572
Come on, Nell, It's Jerry

749
01:30:48,342 --> 01:30:50,640
This is not her normal behavior

750
01:30:50,845 --> 01:30:53,973
She hasn't freaked out like on this
for weeks, Al. You saw the damn tapes

751
01:30:54,315 --> 01:30:55,839
I'm not happy about this, Paula

752
01:30:57,752 --> 01:31:00,312
She's out of her familiar environment

753
01:31:00,688 --> 01:31:02,121
You've had almost three months

754
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:06,692
I want her in here, so we can begin what
we should have been doing from the start

755
01:31:06,994 --> 01:31:09,485
I must have been out of
my mind to bring her here

756
01:31:14,569 --> 01:31:16,196
She needs time, Al, that's all

757
01:31:20,741 --> 01:31:21,708
Come on

758
01:31:24,812 --> 01:31:27,747
Well, we've got the weekend

759
01:31:29,684 --> 01:31:31,811
Maybe by Monday I'll feel happier

760
01:31:35,256 --> 01:31:36,188
Maybe not

761
01:31:55,209 --> 01:31:56,574
They'll shut you away!

762
01:31:57,245 --> 01:32:00,078
Show them how you really are!
Please

763
01:32:13,661 --> 01:32:16,186
My beloved is gone
down into his garden

764
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:19,928
to the beds of spices,
to feed in the gardens

765
01:32:20,935 --> 01:32:24,564
and to gather lilies.
I am my beloved

766
01:32:25,139 --> 01:32:26,731
and my beloved is mine

767
01:32:27,975 --> 01:32:29,943
he feedeth among the lilies

768
01:32:32,246 --> 01:32:36,478
"Thou art beautiful, O my love...
"... as Tirzah...

769
01:32:37,451 --> 01:32:40,818
This isn't, uh, lower level autism,
that's for sure

770
01:33:14,288 --> 01:33:15,915
I want to take her out of here, Paula

771
01:33:16,557 --> 01:33:18,548
We can't. One more day, that's all

772
01:33:18,659 --> 01:33:21,457
You think the judge is gonna
say he knows better than Al Paley?

773
01:33:26,367 --> 01:33:28,665
- I'm taking her out
- Jerry!

774
01:33:28,703 --> 01:33:32,070
Come on, come on. You're gonna walk.
You're gonna walk. Here we go

775
01:33:43,384 --> 01:33:45,978
Come on. I'm talking you out of here.
I'm taking you out

776
01:33:54,428 --> 01:33:55,793
Hey, wait a second!

777
01:33:58,232 --> 01:33:59,824
- Move!
- Sorry

778
01:34:18,219 --> 01:34:19,652
No, not a word

779
01:34:23,290 --> 01:34:24,689
Yeah, I know

780
01:34:28,029 --> 01:34:29,155
Days Inn

781
01:34:31,699 --> 01:34:35,328
Six-oh-one North Tryon.
Room two-two-one

782
01:34:38,706 --> 01:34:41,072
No, we're not going anyplace

783
01:35:01,796 --> 01:35:03,889
I never meant it to be like this, Nell

784
01:35:08,169 --> 01:35:12,105
I'm not your guardian angel. Sorry

785
01:35:26,687 --> 01:35:29,383
But... Je'y feliss aw tye wi' Nell

786
01:35:35,429 --> 01:35:37,192
But I guess all that's over now

787
01:37:04,852 --> 01:37:09,949
Thou au beau'fu',
o ma love, as Tirzah

788
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:31,300
How long she been like this?

789
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:36,541
She's been out for over an hour now.
Just laid herself down and went to sleep

790
01:37:39,086 --> 01:37:39,984
Why here?

791
01:37:42,356 --> 01:37:43,948
I didn't know where else to go

792
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:58,031
So what are we gonna do now?

793
01:38:02,176 --> 01:38:04,644
I'm gonna have to take her
to court tomorrow morning?

794
01:38:06,947 --> 01:38:07,879
Yes

795
01:38:10,184 --> 01:38:11,310
So that's it

796
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,280
Shit

797
01:38:17,791 --> 01:38:22,558
I could... take it if she'd say something
to me. Anything but this silence

798
01:39:29,930 --> 01:39:33,923
Nell is on the threshold
of a hazardous journey

799
01:39:34,702 --> 01:39:36,499
We can guide her on thatjourney

800
01:39:36,770 --> 01:39:39,170
but what we can't do
is turn the clock back.

801
01:39:39,940 --> 01:39:41,669
She can never be a child again

802
01:39:42,910 --> 01:39:47,313
But, uh, we're not here to choose
between her new life and old life

803
01:39:48,048 --> 01:39:49,913
Her new life has already begun

804
01:39:50,417 --> 01:39:54,319
Our task here today is to determine
how we can best help her...

805
01:39:54,521 --> 01:39:57,490
as she takes her first steps
into a wilder world

806
01:39:57,791 --> 01:40:01,056
And in your opinion, Professor...
... Nell does need help?

807
01:40:01,795 --> 01:40:02,659
I don't think that's in doubt

808
01:40:02,696 --> 01:40:05,187
You don't think she's
capable of looking after herself?

809
01:40:05,399 --> 01:40:06,559
No, I do not

810
01:40:06,633 --> 01:40:08,897
What do you think she's been
doing for the last three months?

811
01:40:08,969 --> 01:40:11,802
It's my impression for the past three
months she's made no progress at all

812
01:40:11,839 --> 01:40:14,399
Your counsel will have the opportunity
to put questions to the profes...

813
01:40:14,475 --> 01:40:16,636
What do you call progress?
Turning into someone like you?

814
01:40:16,677 --> 01:40:21,740
- No need to be personal here, Dr. Lovell
- I happen to like Nell, Professor

815
01:40:21,915 --> 01:40:24,179
What you do to her
is personal to me, okay?!

816
01:40:24,218 --> 01:40:25,845
Counsel, you want to
control your client?

817
01:40:26,286 --> 01:40:29,346
You and Dr. Olsen have become
emotionally involved with your patient

818
01:40:29,423 --> 01:40:31,687
She is not my patient!
She is not sick!

819
01:40:31,725 --> 01:40:33,818
She throws fits.
She bangs her head against the wall

820
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:36,352
Oh, for God... It was a glass wall!
She didn't see it!

821
01:40:36,430 --> 01:40:38,022
Dr. Lovell, you will take your seat.

822
01:40:38,065 --> 01:40:40,363
She displays many of the symptoms of...
Asberger's Syndrome...

823
01:40:40,434 --> 01:40:42,698
Oh, bullshit!
She just doesn't want to talk to you!

824
01:40:42,736 --> 01:40:44,260
Does she want to talk to you, Dr. Lovell?

825
01:40:44,371 --> 01:40:46,032
Dr. Lovell, sit down!

826
01:40:58,118 --> 01:40:59,415
I... I'm sorry?

827
01:41:01,121 --> 01:41:02,145
Dr. Lovell?

828
01:41:05,325 --> 01:41:08,453
Je'y? Spee' fo Nell

829
01:41:20,874 --> 01:41:23,866
She says, since her mother died,
she's been alone

830
01:41:27,581 --> 01:41:28,775
She's been afraid

831
01:41:42,796 --> 01:41:44,696
Everyone's frightened, everywhere

832
01:41:45,966 --> 01:41:47,866
The sweet Lord soothes our tears

833
01:41:49,036 --> 01:41:50,025
Our many tears

834
01:41:59,313 --> 01:42:04,876
Our world has... many people in it, Nell.
People who can be your friends.

835
01:42:17,764 --> 01:42:19,959
But you have many things to learn

836
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:27,505
Don't you want that?

837
01:42:37,417 --> 01:42:38,884
You have big things

838
01:42:50,197 --> 01:42:51,459
You know big things

839
01:42:56,036 --> 01:42:59,199
But... you don't
look into each other's eyes

840
01:43:05,012 --> 01:43:08,971
And you're... hungry for quietness

841
01:43:14,788 --> 01:43:16,346
I've lived a small life

842
01:43:19,526 --> 01:43:21,050
I know small things

843
01:43:23,497 --> 01:43:24,589
I know...

844
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:27,026
loved ones

845
01:43:46,353 --> 01:43:47,752
I know everyone goes

846
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:54,791
Everyone goes away

847
01:44:13,413 --> 01:44:16,576
Yeah... I guess so

848
01:44:26,827 --> 01:44:28,385
Don't be frightened for Nell

849
01:44:31,598 --> 01:44:32,826
Don't weep for her

850
01:44:38,372 --> 01:44:39,703
I have no...

851
01:44:44,044 --> 01:44:45,739
greater sorrows than you

852
01:44:48,248 --> 01:44:49,408
Yo'kay?

853
01:45:01,528 --> 01:45:02,927
Yo'kay?

854
01:45:30,524 --> 01:45:31,923
Is Ruthie still asleep?

855
01:45:34,528 --> 01:45:35,495
Yep

856
01:45:36,763 --> 01:45:38,128
Almost there

857
01:45:43,770 --> 01:45:45,761
Well, has everybody
got everything they need?

858
01:45:52,813 --> 01:45:54,610
Hey! What'd I tell you?

859
01:45:54,981 --> 01:45:57,506
You just start eating and
they'll show up. It never fails

860
01:45:57,984 --> 01:46:00,509
We finally made it!
I don't believe it!

861
01:46:03,390 --> 01:46:04,948
Happy birthday, Nell!

862
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:07,752
Happy birthday

863
01:46:33,387 --> 01:46:35,355
Bass ain't hitting this stickbait today

864
01:46:35,822 --> 01:46:37,949
Well, it ain't gonna hit nothing
if you don't hush up

865
01:46:39,593 --> 01:46:40,992
What you using, Don?

866
01:46:41,361 --> 01:46:44,694
Old spinner.
You know Mister Bass can't resist that

867
01:46:45,699 --> 01:46:50,295
I can't tell you how many times I seen
Myrtle Jean and Clara and the little baby...

868
01:47:19,032 --> 01:47:19,999
See that?

869
01:47:20,901 --> 01:47:23,927
And to think I was the big shot
who was gonna change her life

870
01:47:24,271 --> 01:47:25,568
You're not the only one

871
01:47:25,605 --> 01:47:30,304
But you did. Didn't you know?
You were the first

872
01:47:31,545 --> 01:47:32,705
The first what?

873
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:34,540
To need her

874
01:48:00,874 --> 01:48:02,501
You remember that
