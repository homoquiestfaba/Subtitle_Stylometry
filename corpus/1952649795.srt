1
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,188
One silk handkerchief.

2
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:34,819
One necktie.

3
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,614
One watch.

4
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,410
One ring.

5
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,537
One gold money clip
with no money in it.

6
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,173
And one mobile phone.

7
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,811
Fifty cents a day,
minus what you spent inside,

8
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,733
and a train ticket
to the Big Apple.

9
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,437
Good luck, Gekko,
and don't come back.

10
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,696
You want to know what the
mother of all bubbles was?

11
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,994
It came out of nowhere.
By chance.

12
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:22,738
- How many you got, Mac?
- Five.

13
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,495
They called it
the Cambrian Explosion.

14
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,998
It happened around
530 million years ago.

15
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,077
Open the gate!

16
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,254
And over the next 70,
80 million years,

17
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,673
the rate of evolution
accelerated so fast

18
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,342
that we came along.

19
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,341
The human race.

20
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:43,930
They still can't explain how that happened,
except that it happened.

21
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,514
Here he is!

22
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,940
Daddy!

23
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,082
Some people say
it was by chance,

24
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,797
others, design.

25
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,634
But who really knows?

26
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:39,857
The dimming of the light
makes the picture clearer

27
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,948
It's just an old photograph

28
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:47,497
There's nothing to hide

29
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:53,542
When the world
was just beginning

30
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:02,593
I memorized a face
so it's not forgotten

31
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:06,341
I hear the wind whistlin'

32
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:10,554
Come back anytime

33
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:15,939
And we'll mix
our lives together

34
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,486
Heaven knows

35
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:28,163
What keeps mankind alive

36
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,035
Connecting

37
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,624
To places we have known

38
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,553
I'm looking for a home

39
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,383
Where the wheels are turning

40
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:53,063
Home
Why I keep returning

41
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:58,395
Home
With our bodies touching

42
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:04,112
Home
And the cameras watching

43
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,075
Home

44
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:11,123
Will infect whatever you do

45
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,629
We're home

46
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:21,925
Comes to life
from out of the blue

47
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,759
Stop sleeping.

48
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,594
You mean "wake up.""

49
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:36,022
""Wake up"" is positive.
""Stop sleeping"" is a negative.

50
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,522
Either way,
it's not my favorite part of the day.

51
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,854
It's the best
part of the day.

52
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,440
I feel bad for anybody
who feels that way.

53
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,490
It means their day
can't get any better.

54
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,954
You go to bed too late.
You don't sleep enough.

55
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,538
What's going on
with you today?

56
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,791
Did I tell you,
or did you forget?

57
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,790
I'm going to Washington
for the week.

58
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,091
Yeah.
New site, right?

59
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,797
We're launching
in 10 days,

60
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,549
so the whole site's down
starting tomorrow.

61
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,800
What are all
those angry liberals

62
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,472
going to do without
their daily fix, baby?

63
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,892
You're just as liberal as they are,
Mr. Green Energy.

64
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,683
No, no, no.
The only green is money, honey.

65
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,607
Oh, you're so Wall Street,
it makes me sick.

66
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,017
Baby, come here.

67
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,227
No.
What did I ever see in you?

68
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,482
Come here.
No.

69
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,983
My next guest, Gordon Gekko,

70
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,532
was one of the biggest names
on Wall Street in the '80s

71
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:31,157
before he went to prison for insider
trading and securities fraud.

72
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,081
He's out with a new book,
and it is a shocker, believe me.

73
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,374
It is called Is Greed Good?

74
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,746
The man himself
is here with us.

75
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,328
Gordon, good to have
you on the program.

76
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,003
Thank you, Maria.
It's nice to be out.

77
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,672
Turn it off.
One sec.

78
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,091
And I must tell you,
your show is a big, big hit in the can.

79
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,340
Oh.
You watched it in prison?

80
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,466
Your show?

81
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,344
Me and
a whole lot of others.

82
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,600
You wrote the book
in prison?

83
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,929
I did.
I outlined my drafts...

84
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,850
I'm taking a shower.

85
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:15,160
Everybody says
that the living is easy

86
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,914
I can barely see
'Cause my head's in the way

87
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,623
Tigers walk behind me

88
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,251
They are to remind me that

89
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:32,347
I'm lost, but I'm not afraid

90
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,841
Soul to soul

91
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,848
A kiss and a sigh

92
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,895
Sawed in half...

93
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,644
See you next week.

94
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,816
Good luck in Washington.

95
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:55,245
People on the outside
I remember sweet times

96
00:06:55,665 --> 00:07:00,125
This old rose
is always in bloom

97
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,996
Hello?
DR. MASTERS: Jacob.

98
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,080
Dr. Masters.

99
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,167
Good morning, sir.
Don't you get any sleep?

100
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:12,049
Jacob, it happened.
As close as we've come to burn yet.

101
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,592
Really?
How many lasers?

102
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:17,676
We fired 72 this morning,
and we're going to go for 96 next week.

103
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,513
That's fantastic.
That's a game changer, Doc.

104
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,767
So let me guess,

105
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,769
it means we're pushing the pace, right?
You need more money?

106
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,102
Well, it'd be good if we could
get another $100 million.

107
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:30,439
We could pick up maybe
six months on our schedule.

108
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,278
A hundred
million dollars?

109
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,448
As long as the price of oil stays high,
we'll get the money.

110
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,369
That would be nice.
That would be nice.

111
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,203
Because The Foundation says that they're
having some problems in the markets...

112
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,285
You don't worry about that, though, okay, Doc?

113
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,122
You just keep building
that baby star, okay?

114
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,800
Okay. Thank you, Jacob.
Thank you.

115
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,093
All right,
I'll talk to you soon.

116
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:57,592
Now I can say
Those three little words

117
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:02,771
And everyday
I'm dreaming a world

118
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,315
Life is long

119
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,985
If you give it way

120
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,984
So stay, don't go

121
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:15,192
'Cause I'm fading away

122
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:20,831
Soul to soul
Between you and me

123
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:26,332
Chain me down
But I am still free

124
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,838
Hydra Offshore.

125
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,511
Let me repeat this again.

126
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,429
A huge deep-sea
exploration play

127
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,508
off the coast
of Equatorial Guinea.

128
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,843
That's an oil field
that's barely been touched.

129
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:46,773
Remember, the stock's trading
roughly 31 % off the 52-week high

130
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,691
and it's part
owned and funded

131
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,609
by none other than,
guess who.

132
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,104
Churchill Schwartz.

133
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,689
So we know they won't let
anything too bad happen here.

134
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,945
My suggestion is
that we get aggressive.

135
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,573
Agreed?
- Yeah.

136
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,907
We all agree?

137
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,240
Ed, what do you think?

138
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,290
I don't agree.
Maybe it's just me.

139
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,790
Equatorial Guinea's
a pretty tough dictatorship.

140
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,712
This guy's already nationalized
the gold and diamond mines.

141
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,834
So what's your point?

142
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:11,960
I just don't think
it's a risk our desk

143
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,963
should be taking right now,
that's all. I'd wait.

144
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,210
Wait? Wait for what?
Yeah.

145
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,966
Your ""Beam me up, Scottie""
hydrogen fusion deal?

146
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,263
Now you're talking
about something else.

147
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,805
It's United Fusion
Corporation, Stan.

148
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:20,973
Come on.
It's apples and oranges.

149
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,141
Oh, really?
Yeah.

150
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,718
You mean the deal
that we already sank

151
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,895
$50 million into,
Mr. Brainiac?

152
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:29,315
Alternative energy is what
biotech was 15 years ago, Stan.

153
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,775
Come on. You were young once.
You know that.

154
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,727
Profits aren't quarterly.
The runs could be huge.

155
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,564
We'll all be dead by the time your
nutty professor makes us any money.

156
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,616
Right, this coming from the guy
who said Google was a bubble.

157
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,996
Anyway. Hydra Offshore.

158
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:47,872
It's priced right for us to make
three to five times on our money.

159
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,248
And better yet,
what we all love the most.

160
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,171
Big year-end bonuses.

161
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,011
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's make some dough!

162
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,178
What's up? You good?

163
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,980
I can't!
It's not up to me.

164
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,154
Maybe I can do it,
maybe I can't do it.

165
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,277
People are
telling me something.

166
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,110
Jesus!
Harry, you gave me your word.

167
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,865
You know I know!

168
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,114
You okay, Lou?

169
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,289
Good day, I'm okay.
Bad day, I'm okay.

170
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,745
What's the difference?

171
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,502
Do me a favor.
Don't ask me dumb questions.

172
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,125
You wanted to see me?

173
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,960
Steve, stay on
top of Harry, okay?

174
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,215
He's driving me crazy.

175
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,421
You got it, boss.

176
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,014
Follow me.

177
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,688
Why?

178
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,142
That's some ""Thank you."" What do you want,
a kiss, too?

179
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,649
I thought maybe the news out of
London would've wrecked the mood.

180
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,900
London?
Don't tell me London.

181
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,482
I take a look
at their sheets.

182
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:03,444
They tell me they got a $125 million profit, right?

183
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,199
I look at
the same lousy spread,

184
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,030
to me it looks like
a buck and a quarter loss.

185
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,911
Then they tell me,
""Don't worry about it.

186
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,708
""We're making money
on the losses.""

187
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,787
How do you make money on losses?
You tell me.

188
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,838
I'm just an old dinosaur.

189
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,961
Lou, I believe in Keller Zabel.
We're fine.

190
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,212
And you're not a dinosaur.
Come on.

191
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,669
It's no fun
anymore, Jacob.

192
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,593
I'm talking to some guy in Mumbai, Dumbai.

193
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,424
I don't know what
he's talking about.

194
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,475
I don't know what he's selling,
I don't know who he is,

195
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:29,973
I don't know
how much I'm putting up.

196
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,431
And my partners, they're in their graves.
They're laughing at me.

197
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,358
It's just a bunch of machines now,
telling us what to do.

198
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,812
That's why you got people like me here, Lou,
to lighten the load.

199
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,441
Getting old is
not for sissies, kid.

200
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,868
Take that money, huh?

201
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,575
You spend it on that pretty girl.
You deserve it.

202
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,209
I remember when
the pro sent me you.

203
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,916
This skinny kid
with crazy hair.

204
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,969
I said, ""Jimmy, what are you doing to me?
Give me a real caddy.""

205
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,677
I was having a bad day,
and you wouldn't shut up.

206
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,724
Twelve years old,
you're talking to me about

207
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:12,929
companies and
sectors and earnings.

208
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:20,946
You had the hunger, Jake.
I could smell it then. You still got it.

209
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,278
I've just never had a check
like this in my hands before.

210
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,737
You spend it.
Somebody has to keep our economy going.

211
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,372
Well, get out of my office.

212
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,380
Thank you.

213
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,351
Princess cut.

214
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,979
Platinum-banded,
one and a half carat.

215
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,894
There's nothing
quite like a ring...

216
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:02,355
Can you take me
to the money room?

217
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:07,529
You mean
the private client foyer?

218
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,489
That's it.

219
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,858
Olga from Russia,
with love.

220
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,614
How are you?

221
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,738
Shots
or champagne, guys?

222
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,843
She was scoping you
for the kill, bro.

223
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,046
Perfect. An 11, man.
Gisele time.

224
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,722
No. This is...

225
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,601
Wow. You're serious.

226
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:19,764
Yeah.

227
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:24,736
So young,
and already pricing yourself off the market.

228
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,609
'Tron?
Shots.

229
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,196
So when are you
gonna ask her?

230
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,152
She's not that crazy
about marriage, you know.

231
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,202
I mean,
look at her parents.

232
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,702
A girl's got to get it straight with her pop,
don't you think?

233
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:37,908
What if you have kids?

234
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,208
Yeah,
it's going be tough.

235
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,876
Did you hear what he said
on TV the other night?

236
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:45,006
""Home loan defaults are just the first
raindrop in the mother of all storms.""

237
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,841
Christ.
Sour grapes, this man.

238
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,511
The guy is a legend.
Gordon the Gekko.

239
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,681
He's speaking next week up at
your old alma mater, Fordham.

240
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:54,890
Watch yourself.

241
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,592
Hey buddy, get a cane.
Come on, come on.

242
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,687
A few of us are going up after work
to check him out. Come along.

243
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,560
I can't.
Winnie, you know.

244
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,141
The only God
you worship is Zabel.

245
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:07,070
I don't worship the man.
He got me a seat at the table.

246
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,862
The word is he's stuck with a ton of toxic

247
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,565
sub-prime debt off
the balance sheet.

248
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,571
Billions.
Can't find a bid for it.

249
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:13,822
Yeah, so what?

250
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,738
So, buddy,
it don't matter if the rumors are true or not.

251
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,915
Because in this climate,
it's what buyers believe.

252
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,491
And where there's smoke,
there's fire.

253
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,456
I'll make you a bet right now.
Go.

254
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,079
I got a million dollars left of
my bonus, okay? Mmm-hmm.

255
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,914
It's yours tomorrow a.m.

256
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,216
You put it in KZI shares.
You leverage that to the max.

257
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,418
That's how much I believe
in this company.

258
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:31,844
Did you not hear me?

259
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,671
Listen,
as your only friend left

260
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,427
from a place in Long Island
no one can remember,

261
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:36,849
Iet alone pronounce,

262
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,222
I'm telling you,
you're acting like your mama.

263
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,480
Don't do that.
Leave her out of this.

264
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:45,309
Plus, why would he spot-bonus me
right now if we were in trouble, huh?

265
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,438
It makes no sense.

266
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,736
Look, you don't want to
make any money on this, fine.

267
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,063
I'm sure Harry Shapiro
would love to.

268
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:51,113
Okay, okay.

269
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,282
I'm a hooker, too.
Send it to me.

270
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,825
You're still young enough
to recover.

271
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,075
I'll ream you
on the commission.

272
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,656
I'm gonna love
the look on your face

273
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,240
when I make
so much money off this.

274
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,041
I'll have no choice
but to walk away.

275
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,415
Guys, we're looking at an
unprecedented meltdown here.

276
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,000
I've never seen
anything like it...

277
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,254
Keller Zabel's loss today
was the worst in over a year.

278
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,634
And this big drop may be
just the beginning

279
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,887
of a much deeper correction.

280
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:22,725
It is an amazing story.
Keller Zabel stock is getting hammered.

281
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,807
How is it you've never been more
wrong in your life than right now?

282
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,109
You're losing all your money right now.
I see it, it's going down.

283
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:31,529
Somebody is betting big money that
Zabel's stock is about to collapse.

284
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:32,651
You wanna owe?

285
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,690
This stock's about to lose
its bar mitzvah, Jake.

286
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,697
Take the haircut and sell.
You're on a 50% margin, buddy.

287
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,951
I can still get you out now at a total loss,
but at least you won't owe.

288
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,828
...threatening
the firm's liquidity.

289
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:47,663
In one incredible week,
shares of KZI are down 52%.

290
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,831
I know where the stock is.
I have it in front of me.

291
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,008
What you got to do right now is relax,
take a deep breath.

292
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,959
T ell your banks
not to sell the stock.

293
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,216
The stock is overreacting
right now and...

294
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,717
Hey, what financial
stock isn't, right?

295
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,220
Listen, three months from now we're
going to look back on this and laugh.

296
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,471
You're angry? I'm angry.

297
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,642
Okay! We're okay.

298
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,970
Relax.
- Relax.

299
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:06,640
Jesus Christ.

300
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,565
I've known you
your whole life, Jake.

301
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,772
And I know when
you're lying to yourself.

302
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,731
Robby, listen to me.
Keller Zabel's been around a long time.

303
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,567
All right? It's one of the great
names in investment banking.

304
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,152
A month, a year,
it doesn't matter.

305
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,778
We'll be back to 65/70,
and I'll be fine.

306
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,363
You just gotta hold it, okay?

307
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,203
You're gonna owe, you know.

308
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,750
Not just the buck, but the margin, too.
We're talking another...

309
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,077
Tell me.

310
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,875
You don't
want to hear this today.

311
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,207
Robby.

312
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:33,624
How much?

313
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,050
At least another
half a buck.

314
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,971
Give me the okay
to sell, buddy.

315
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,640
Right now.

316
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,969
Sell. Sell!

317
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,472
Robby,
I got to call you later.

318
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,640
Have you seen Zabel?

319
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,359
Annica, where's Lou?

320
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,321
Not in.
Not answering.

321
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:05,994
Not happy.

322
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:13,914
Hey.

323
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,338
Lou.

324
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,681
Hey, Lou.
How's your day going, huh?

325
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:27,019
I told you. Good day,
I'm okay. Bad day, I'm okay.

326
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,098
Stop bugging me on my feelings.
They're irrelevant.

327
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:32,900
I wanted to come
see you face to face

328
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,397
and talk about these rumors,
you know.

329
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,069
Because it's getting crazy.
It's out of control now.

330
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,317
I'm hearing it
from all ends.

331
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:38,443
Our world is all bullshit.

332
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:43,411
Some TV bubblehead,
he gets up there like he knows something.

333
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,030
He sells fear, panic.

334
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,449
And morons, they love it.

335
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,206
They want it to end
because it sells.

336
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,458
There's no limits anymore.

337
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:57,299
Muriel knows how to walk this thing.
It's her damn dog.

338
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,377
Lou, I can help.
I can get to the bottom of these derivatives.

339
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,882
You just got to tell me.

340
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,463
There's so much
you don't know, Jacob.

341
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,345
What? What about
the bonus thing? Why now?

342
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:09,391
Because I know you.
You're holding out for something better.

343
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,933
Well, don't. Spend it.
Use the money.

344
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,983
Because one day, you're gonna
wake up and you're gonna be dead.

345
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,777
Lou, you got to get yourself together,
all right?

346
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,070
We're gonna be fine.

347
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,363
No matter how bad
this thing gets,

348
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,986
we have real equity
in this company.

349
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,283
We're gonna get through this.

350
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,826
Marry Gekko's daughter.

351
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,904
Make some kids with her.

352
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,613
And you spend
as much time as you can

353
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,035
with those kids
when they're young

354
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,162
because everything changes.
Everything.

355
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,211
I cannot help you if I don't understand
what you are talking about.

356
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,040
There's 15,000 jobs
on the line right now.

357
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,375
Somebody's after us, right?
Somebody's trying to hurt us.

358
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,712
There's a reason this is happening.
I need to know how and why.

359
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,172
You know that
dream you got about

360
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,131
that little energy company
in California?

361
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:49,344
You may not get there,
but you hold on to that.

362
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,928
Because everything else
is just noise.

363
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,856
It's not just noise.
There's 15,000 jobs on the line.

364
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,525
Fifteen thousand people here.
That's not noise.

365
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,692
Are we going under?

366
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,735
I never liked this damn dog.

367
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,814
Louis, are we going under?

368
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,651
You're asking
the wrong question, Jacob.

369
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,327
What's the right question?

370
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,071
Who isn't?

371
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:41,987
China's out.

372
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,773
You said...

373
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,859
I know
what I said, Bill.

374
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,404
Two months we negotiated
with these pikers.

375
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,738
They pulled out
at 7:00 p.m.

376
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,620
So what's new?
They're Chinese.

377
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,620
And while they were negotiating,
we lost the Koreans.

378
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:58,420
So you're saying
you don't have an out.

379
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:02,045
No, I'm saying,
just give me one week.

380
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:06,087
We're still talking to the British.
And the Arabs are back in,

381
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,093
and this time it's for real.

382
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,300
Lou,
we've heard this before.

383
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:14,353
Jesus. Paul,
we lost billions this week.

384
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,431
If the markets don't roll over
our paper Sunday night,

385
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,811
before Asia opens,

386
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,770
Keller Zabel cannot do business on Monday.

387
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,694
Tuesday, 15,000 people are
gonna be out of a job, worldwide!

388
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:29,528
Lou, you understated the
scale of your bad loans.

389
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,988
Your valuations
are no longer believable.

390
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,458
After all these years,

391
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,211
you say this to me?

392
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,250
Me?

393
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:46,169
Three-quarters of the
banking houses at this table

394
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:50,051
are holding the same paper,
and you're gonna let Keller Zabel fail?

395
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:55,348
You're all
committing suicide.

396
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,983
What do you say, Harry?
Will you come in on this?

397
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,858
Look, if you want us
to bail out Keller Zabel,

398
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,610
all of us
will have to participate.

399
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,820
Like Long-Term Capital, '98.

400
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:12,244
And we will need substantial
guarantees from the US Treasury.

401
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,332
Bill, I think
we should talk privately.

402
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,584
I think that's
a good idea, Bill.

403
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,458
Gentlemen,
give us a minute.

404
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,873
What about
moral hazard, Jack?

405
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,959
We bail out Keller Zabel,
who's to say

406
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,261
it's not gonna
happen again and again?

407
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,216
You vindictive bastard.

408
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,766
Who are you to talk
about moral hazard?

409
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:39,893
I'm sorry, Lou.

410
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,350
The Street needs to make a
statement here to the world.

411
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,980
It was eight years ago!

412
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,770
You just can't let it go,
can you, Bretton?

413
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,822
All right, Lou,
knock it off.

414
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,122
I'd like to speak with you, Bill. Jack.

415
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,120
And Lou.

416
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,250
Separately.

417
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,170
Thirty
of our people

418
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:06,749
have been through the Keller Zabel
books for the last three days.

419
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:10,177
And they still say it's impossible
to get to the bottom of this.

420
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,384
This could be a 1 0-billion dollar hole for us.

421
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,887
Or it could be
a 200-billion dollar hole

422
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:17,718
and there's no way
we can risk that money

423
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,974
without a backstop
from Treasury or the Fed.

424
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,147
You started this,
didn't you, Bretton?

425
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,351
I said knock it off, Lou.
Or this meeting is over, you hear me?

426
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,566
You're asking us to take
a large risk here, Bretton.

427
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,692
What are you offering?

428
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:33,276
Under these conditions,
and assuming

429
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,412
you refine your guarantee,

430
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,741
Jack, Julie and I,
and our partners who have been consulted,

431
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,045
are prepared to
risk $2 a share.

432
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:48,674
Two bucks?

433
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,678
Jesus.
You're out of your mind.

434
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:56,925
The stock was trading
at 79 a month ago!

435
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:00,765
Our building alone is worth
more than two bucks a share.

436
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:02,270
Julie.

437
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:05,725
If only we had
more time, Lou.

438
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:06,934
My board will
never accept this.

439
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,066
There is no way I'm gonna
sell for two bucks a share.

440
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,773
The government,
if we guarantee this deal,

441
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,154
could never justify a high
price for your company.

442
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,277
And if you don't sell,
Lou, you're in bankruptcy.

443
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,910
This is
a public spectacle now.

444
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,993
No, it's a public execution,
and you'll be leading it, Bill.

445
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:25,419
I built this company.

446
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,622
And your exit will
help restore faith in it.

447
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,957
Who the hell are you
to tell me to get out?

448
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:32,509
You're out, Lou!
One way or the other, you're out.

449
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,632
Then the hell with you!

450
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,760
I'll take my chances
in bankruptcy court

451
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,933
before I sell
to that barracuda.

452
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,741
Then we have nothing
more to talk about.

453
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,449
Six.

454
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:10,001
Three, and that's it.
If I can sell it to the board.

455
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:11,081
Five.

456
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,336
Three.
All right.

457
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:16,842
We'll call it an even four,
so it don't look so goddamn pathetic.

458
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,975
Three.

459
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,313
And not a dime more.

460
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,379
We have breaking news
right now.

461
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,173
Earlier this morning
in a New York City subway,

462
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:19,126
Keller Zabel managing partner

463
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,256
and head of
one of the biggest

464
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,962
investment firms
on Wall Street,

465
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,264
Louis Zabel, 75,

466
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,842
apparently jumped
in front of an oncoming train

467
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:28,768
in front of
hundreds of bystanders.

468
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,555
The stock is currently halted,
pending news...

469
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,187
Churchill Schwartz is making
out like a bandit right now

470
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:35,313
with government funding.

471
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,315
But Keller Zabel
as an independent

472
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:39,237
investment bank is
essentially finished.

473
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,857
Tom, this news
about Louis Zabel today

474
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,694
comes as a shock to everyone.
But how are you holding up there?

475
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,870
The guy was
an icon on Wall Street.

476
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:49,243
I always thought of him
as sort of a mentor to me.

477
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,326
So to see this happen under the
circumstances that it did happen,

478
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:53,627
it's devastating.

479
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,542
What's it mean to the
employees at Keller Zabel?

480
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,837
I think they've lost their leader.
They're going to be...

481
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,340
Frankly, financially,
a lot of them are gonna be badly hurt.

482
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:03,921
This is gonna hurt
on so many fronts.

483
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,802
I know it's still difficult to think about it

484
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,599
with this news just
coming out about Louis

485
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,971
but you have to
wonder what this means

486
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,268
for the future
of Wall Street.

487
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:14,106
Another firm gone,
it leaves very few players left on the Street.

488
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,516
One thing
I know for sure is

489
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,977
more competition is better
than less competition.

490
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,287
I just heard.
I'm so sorry.

491
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,296
Will you marry me, Winnie?

492
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,222
Will you marry me?

493
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:53,725
What's wrong?

494
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:01,065
It's just something Lou said
about not waiting, you know?

495
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,529
And I love you.

496
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,324
Yes.

497
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,289
Yes?

498
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:28,005
You know, I should tell you due diligence.
There's some...

499
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,342
I'm out of a job and probably on
the other side of broke, you know.

500
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,095
Awesome.

501
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:39,191
I'm looking for a home

502
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:43,195
Where the wheels are turning

503
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,692
Home
Why I keep returning

504
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:54,949
Home
Will infect whatever you do

505
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,459
In one of the harshest sentences ever given

506
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:01,380
to a white collar criminal at that time,
in 1993,

507
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:05,835
he was sent off to Otis Federal
Prison for almost eight years.

508
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:11,716
And so, here in person,
I welcome the man himself, Mr. Insider,

509
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,266
Gordon Gekko.

510
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:20,978
Thank you.

511
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,079
You're all
pretty much fucked.

512
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,420
You don't know it yet,

513
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,792
but you're
the NINJA generation.

514
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,298
No income.

515
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,422
No job.

516
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,510
No assets.

517
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,760
You got a lot to
look forward to.

518
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,641
Blood, buddy.
He's gonna be your blood.

519
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:07,279
Someone reminded me
the other evening

520
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,532
that I once said,
"Greed is good."

521
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,743
Now it seems it's legal.

522
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,082
But, folks,

523
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:22,036
it's greed that
makes my bartender

524
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,995
buy three houses
he can't afford

525
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,797
with no money down.

526
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,008
And it's greed that
makes your parents

527
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:33,050
refinance their
$200, 000 house for 250.

528
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,967
And then they take that extra 50
and they go down to the mall.

529
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:40,725
And they buy
a plasma TV, cell phones,

530
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:44,104
computers, an SUV.
And hey,

531
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:47,398
why not a second home while we're at it?
Because, gee whiz,

532
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:51,778
we all know that prices of houses
in America always go up, right?

533
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,909
It's greed that makes the
government in this country

534
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:58,705
cut the interest rates
to one-percent, after 9/11.

535
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,242
So we could all
go shopping again.

536
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,920
They got all these fancy names
for trillions of dollars of credit.

537
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:09,045
CMOs, CDOs, SIVs, ABSs.

538
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:13,174
I honestly think there's may
be only 75 people in the world

539
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,054
who know what they are.

540
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,758
But I'll tell
you what they are.

541
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:22,972
They're WMDs. Weapons of Mass Destruction.
That's what they are.

542
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:26,650
When I was away,
it seemed like greed got greedier

543
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,318
with a little bit of envy
mixed in.

544
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:35,193
Hedge funders were walking home with 50,
100 million bucks a year.

545
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,656
So Mr. Banker,
he's looks around,

546
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,033
and he says, "My life
looks pretty boring."

547
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:44,918
So he starts leveraging his interests up to 40,
50 to one

548
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,666
with your money.

549
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,747
Not his, yours.

550
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,378
Because he could.

551
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,544
You're supposed to be borrowing,
not them.

552
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,638
And the beauty of the deal,

553
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:00,138
no one is responsible.

554
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:04,225
Because everybody's
drinking the same Kool-Aid.

555
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,606
Last year,
ladies and gentlemen,

556
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:10,402
forty percent of all American corporate profits

557
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:12,445
came from
financial services.

558
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:13,856
Not production,

559
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,613
not anything remotely to do with
the needs of the American public.

560
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,910
The truth is,
we 're all part of it now.

561
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:24,700
Banks, consumers,
we're moving money around in circles.

562
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,834
We take a buck,

563
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:30,710
we shoot it full of steroids,
and we call it "leverage."

564
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,668
I call it
"steroid banking."

565
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:39,131
I've been considered a pretty smart
guy when it comes to finance.

566
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:40,215
That was fantastic, man.

567
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,680
And maybe I was
in prison too long.

568
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,520
But sometimes it's the only place to stay sane

569
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,438
and look out through
those bars and say,

570
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,983
"Hey! Is everybody
out there nuts?"

571
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:00,573
It's clear as a bell
to those that pay attention.

572
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:06,667
The mother of all evil
is speculation.

573
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,662
Leveraged debt.

574
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:12,464
Bottom line.

575
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,467
It's borrowing to the hilt.

576
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:19,175
And I hate to tell you this,

577
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:22,599
but it's a bankrupt business model.
It won 't work.

578
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:27,812
It's systemic, malignant,
and it's global.

579
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,307
Like cancer.

580
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,312
It's a disease,
and we got to fight back.

581
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,569
How are we gonna do that?

582
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,823
How are we gonna leverage
that disease back in our favor?

583
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,285
Well, I'll tell you.

584
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,075
Three words.

585
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,375
Buy my book.

586
00:34:58,138 --> 00:35:00,299
Prices and profits work.

587
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,016
This is the kind
of energy we need out there.

588
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,218
You just keep it up.

589
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,594
Mr. Gekko!

590
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,097
Excuse me for
a moment, sir.

591
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,852
Q and A's over,
all right?

592
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:15,523
Buy the book.
There's no more free advice.

593
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:18,154
My name is Jacob Moore.
I'm gonna marry your daughter.

594
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,197
Does she know that?

595
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:26,363
She pretended to.

596
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,040
All right,
I'll give you 10 minutes.

597
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:33,211
I'm a prop trader
at Keller Zabel.

598
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:34,708
I specialize in energy with a focus on...

599
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,380
Sorry about Lou.

600
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:39,050
One of the toughest guys
that ever wore shoes.

601
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,502
But when those
rumors start...

602
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,713
Yeah. I wish I
knew who started this.

603
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,887
I loved him very much.

604
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,302
Like a father.

605
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,883
He got me a scholarship here at Fordham

606
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,434
and hired me right out of business school.

607
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,261
Well, no one else
in this market's

608
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,605
had the balls
to commit suicide.

609
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,150
It's an honorable
thing to do.

610
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,817
Mr. Gekko, I'm in love
with your daughter.

611
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,523
And I'd be honored...

612
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,241
Why is that funny?

613
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:07,821
My daughter hasn't spoken to me in years,
and you know it.

614
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:10,407
She blames me for
her brother's overdose

615
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,585
and just about every other
disaster that's hit this world

616
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,378
since Nintendo.

617
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,584
You don't think
it's strange that

618
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,587
she's dating somebody
from Wall Street?

619
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:20,713
Why?

620
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,419
Because she hates it.

621
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:25,256
You don't think it's funny that
she'd fall in love with you?

622
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,305
I bet you don't
have one of these.

623
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,433
No. Can I see that?

624
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,597
Yeah.

625
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,692
It's when she was eight.

626
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,612
Can I have a copy of it?
She doesn't keep pictures from her childhood.

627
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,942
I don't even know you,
you already want something from me, huh?

628
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,577
So what do I get in return?

629
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:49,950
Don't you want
to make a trade?

630
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,872
Yeah, okay.
All right.

631
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,043
I'll give you this and you give
me another picture of Winnie.

632
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,462
Recent, without you in it.

633
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,210
I don't have one on me.

634
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,211
I guess this is
on margin, huh?

635
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,217
It's always
been energy.

636
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,261
I've been specializing
more and more in clean tech.

637
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,717
It's sort of a passion now.

638
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:13,303
That's smart.
That's the next bubble.

639
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:17,019
What are you, some kind of
energy freedom-fighter?

640
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,353
No, Mr. Gekko.
I'm in this game

641
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:19,810
to make money
like anybody else.

642
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,815
So what about money, Jake?

643
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,112
You like her?

644
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,614
Do I like...

645
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:28,239
I've never thought
about money as a ""she.""

646
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:29,570
Oh!

647
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,576
She lies there
in bed at night with you,

648
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,742
Iooking at you, one eye open.

649
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,504
Money's a bitch
that never sleeps.

650
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,923
And she's jealous.

651
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,297
And if you don't
pay close attention,

652
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,801
you wake up in the morning,
and she might be gone forever.

653
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,010
Respectfully,

654
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,185
Mr. Gekko,
I don't want to end up

655
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:56,646
where you are
because of money.

656
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,815
Oh, yeah.
So marry it instead, right?

657
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,229
What do you mean?

658
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:06,531
Winnie doesn't
have any money.

659
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:10,902
Right.

660
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,118
Here I thought
you were a gold-digger.

661
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,621
Does Winnie know
you came to see me?

662
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,043
No.

663
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:22,547
Well, not exactly.
I was gonna tell her.

664
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,460
I don't think
that's a good idea, pal.

665
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,795
See, I got a feeling you may
want to be seeing me again

666
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,302
and if she knew
we had this little pow-wow,

667
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,882
she's not gonna
let it happen.

668
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,475
You know what?
You're a smart kid.

669
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,807
You should just walk away.
You never met me.

670
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,392
I don't understand.

671
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,650
I think...

672
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,399
The man that
you loved like a father

673
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,276
who threw himself
under a subway?

674
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,107
I think you're angrier
than you think you are.

675
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:52,194
And I think you wanna be
in the family business.

676
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,324
Which is what?

677
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,621
Payback.

678
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,283
Except I'm not
in that business anymore.

679
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,039
Because the one thing
I learned in jail

680
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:03,417
is that money is not
the prime asset in life.

681
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:04,497
Time is.

682
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,082
And your time
is just about up.

683
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,678
Winnie needs to get past
the pain you caused her.

684
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:12,472
I caused her?

685
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,682
Look, she wants you
back in her life.

686
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,634
She just can't
handle it right now.

687
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,685
Okay? Maybe I can help.

688
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:23,142
Maybe you can, maybe you can.
That's what makes the market, Jake.

689
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,980
This is my station.

690
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,312
That is my email address.

691
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,870
By the way,
the rumors on Zabel?

692
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,167
Yeah?

693
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:43,540
It had to be someone with
enough clout to be believed,

694
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,373
somebody who made a fortune
shorting the stock.

695
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,423
An axe to grind.

696
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:53,171
Word has it that Bretton
James gutted Zabel at the Fed.

697
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:56,307
Just stuck that knife
right into his stomach.

698
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,104
Check out 2000.

699
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,900
The Internet bubble.

700
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,320
Churchill Schwartz,
they got hosed.

701
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:14,116
You know there's
fortunes to be made.

702
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:17,695
Hundreds of millions of dollars
betting against this bubble.

703
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,246
Just wish I had a million.

704
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,588
It checks out, baby.

705
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:32,295
Thirteen banks were approached in
2000 to rescue Churchill Schwartz.

706
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:34,178
Bretton James' division
was over-invested

707
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,926
in the Internet
bubble collapse.

708
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,388
Each bank was going to put up 100 million,
but Zabel said no.

709
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:40,810
Churchill Schwartz
almost went down

710
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:42,637
but was backstopped by a
conglomerate of nine banks.

711
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,768
Okay, so not only
did they survive this,

712
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,942
but they came back and ate our fricking lunch.

713
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:49,018
Moral hazard.

714
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,774
Unbelievable.
The man's a hypocrite.

715
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,240
Jacob Moore.

716
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:55,692
DR. MASTERS: Hey, Jake.
Hey, Doc.

717
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,779
I don't know, Jake. We're on hold here.
Now they're telling me...

718
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,990
Hold on just a second.
Hold on just a second.

719
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,374
I'll see you.
We'll have drinks. Okay.

720
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:05,289
It's not over.
All right, Olaf? Thank you.

721
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,415
Go ahead, Doc.

722
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:08,997
They're telling me
we have to cut staff.

723
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:13,005
We went back to Third Boston,
and they turned us down.

724
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,840
And since your firm, um...

725
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,509
Listen,
I totally understand, okay?

726
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,057
But I think I can keep this thing
going with minimal cutbacks.

727
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,224
Look, Jake.

728
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:24,308
I think we have to have a face-to-face
talk with my people, because...

729
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:25,388
I totally agree, Doc.

730
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,644
It's just that I'm walking into a
critical meeting right now. Okay?

731
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:31,568
But I'll definitely have it on your
desk tomorrow a.m., okay?

732
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:32,736
Okay.
Okay.

733
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,146
Robby, what do you got?

734
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,358
We got movement definitely
on Tuesday of that week.

735
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,443
There was some large shorts from
money out of the Cayman Islands.

736
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:39,869
Something called
Locust Fund.

737
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,074
Locust Fund.

738
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,200
What else?

739
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,327
Wednesday, they traded
another 500,000 shares.

740
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:45,625
Monday, two million.

741
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:47,953
Tuesday, one million more.
Total of 3.5 million shares.

742
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,208
These guys made
some serious money.

743
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,836
Who is that, though?
Who is the Locust Fund?

744
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,384
I don't know. And I don't want to find out.
It could be my ass.

745
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:58,297
It'll be your ass if I tell your girlfriend
about the pumps and heels.

746
00:41:58,391 --> 00:41:59,346
Which girlfriend?

747
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,390
Just find out, all right?
I got a hunch.

748
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,263
I hope it's better
than your last one.

749
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,969
Do I hear revenge here?

750
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,225
It's a dish
you stick to cold, pal.

751
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,599
I'm about to
serve it up hot, Robby.

752
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,658
I told you.
Guinea's pulling the plug.

753
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:22,863
This dictator, Ojukwa,
he says Western bankers are greedy.

754
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,663
What else is new?
Listen. Okay?

755
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:27,584
You will not lose on this.
Not on this.

756
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,251
Look, if there's one thing I know,
it's energy,

757
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,420
and that the Church
is gonna get hit on this.

758
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,172
Is this true?

759
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,879
Oh, yeah. I'm telling you,
it's gonna happen.

760
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:43,558
He's definitely gonna nationalize the oil.
I promise you.

761
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,055
Are you behind it?

762
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,353
No. Churchill Schwartz is.
They got a huge stake.

763
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,227
Can't get behind that size,
but you and your boys can.

764
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:51,979
You should.

765
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,518
All I'm asking

766
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:54,819
is you rent me
this beautiful thing

767
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,066
for the weekend,
and we're good.

768
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:57,397
Deal?

769
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,067
Deal. Super deal.

770
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,744
Can he just take over the oil like that?

771
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,750
The guy's out of his mind.
He's talking to witch doctors.

772
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:14,830
He's gonna murder the stock.

773
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,666
I know.
That's why you gotta get in.

774
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,679
Jake, that company,
Offshore African Oil...

775
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,090
Yeah. Hydra Offshore.

776
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:27,052
And you're saying Churchill
Schwartz is a part of it?

777
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,181
Mmm-hmm.

778
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:32,265
Over here is gonna be the most
expensive item by tomorrow.

779
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,105
It's Alice,
in Wonderland.

780
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,652
Churchill Schwartz has a
huge position in this thing.

781
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:40,822
I want to get
short that stock.

782
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,320
Churchill Schwartz
is behind that?

783
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,117
It's just a rumor.
It might take a hit.

784
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,790
Hear about
that African deal?

785
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,701
Yeah, I heard
they're gonna nationalize.

786
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:55,838
Churchill Schwartz!
Off the floor!

787
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:59,296
They're creating rumors
around the Hydra position.

788
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:01,628
None of it's true.
They're just trying to kill the stock.

789
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:02,962
Doesn't make any difference
what's going on.

790
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,423
Then start another
goddamn rumor is what you do.

791
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:08,225
MAN 3:... short quickly and quietly
without everyone figuring out...

792
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,686
I'm convinced what they're after is Churchill,

793
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,309
which has a big
position in this stock

794
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,561
because Churchill got the
sweetheart deal on Keller Zabel.

795
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,483
Churchill Schwartz has a
five-percent position in it.

796
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:18,653
Who knows?
Who's got the inside line on

797
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,730
some tin-pot
dictator in Africa?

798
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:33,208
House of pain.

799
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:34,581
The house of pain!

800
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,212
Hydra Offshore got taken
to the woodshed today.

801
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,171
This one's getting beaten
like a redhead stepchild.

802
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:44,425
Down a quick 19% on rumors
of oil nationalization...

803
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:46,180
No, no!

804
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,387
...in Equatorial Guinea.
There's a country for you.

805
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:50,513
Get them.

806
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:51,560
The shockwave from this one

807
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:55,356
extended all the way to investment
bank Churchill Schwartz.

808
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:58,776
Churchill Schwartz down eight
percent in pre-market trading.

809
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:03,610
Home builder confidence
falls to a record low in July.

810
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,613
The monthly indicator from the
National Association of Homebuilders

811
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,695
dropped for a third
consecutive month...

812
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,450
You got
your high ceilings.

813
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,538
Bonus playroom upstairs,
not that I'm rushing you.

814
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:17,378
Oh. Here.

815
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:21,878
This is going to be the sun room.
Perfect for reading.

816
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,459
It'll get great light.

817
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,216
And there's plenty of room for a pool

818
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:28,298
or a tennis
court. See?

819
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:32,185
What's going on with
Rainwater Road, Ma?

820
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,720
I'm showing it
tomorrow.

821
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,145
Yeah?
Yeah.

822
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,560
Sylvia,
I think it's lovely.

823
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:39,734
Long Island
always goes up.

824
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,732
Great schools, great shopping,
lots of doctors.

825
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,654
Everybody loves it here.

826
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,816
You ought to buy it.

827
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,820
There are quite a few choices on this block.

828
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,288
That's what I love about you, dear.
You call it like you see it.

829
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:58,711
I'd rather have this
down payment any day.

830
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,207
Ma, you got
three properties.

831
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:03,962
Two of the loans are resetting in a few months.

832
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:05,338
You got to sell
at least one.

833
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,878
Oh, don't tell me
my job, Jacob.

834
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:10,260
There are no buyers
out there right now.

835
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:12,433
The market's soft.
Everybody reads the same news.

836
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,181
I just gotta
wait it out.

837
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,558
It's like the two Florida properties five years ago.

838
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:20,483
I didn't get spooked,
and I flipped 190 grand from them.

839
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,145
What does Henry say?

840
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,650
Oh, Henry. Forget about him.
He's a wimp.

841
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:26,901
That's done?

842
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:31,953
Oh, if I listened to Henry,
I would have sold every house way too soon.

843
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,995
He's just like
your father was.

844
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:35,368
No. Dad had bad luck.

845
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,290
He took a shot and he failed.
But he took a shot, Ma.

846
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,710
Yeah, and then Jack Daniels took his shot,
and he succeeded.

847
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,253
Can we not have an argument about my father

848
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,375
every time I
come to see you?

849
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,082
So sensitive.
Forget I said anything.

850
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:49,592
God. Defending your father
is like defending smallpox.

851
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:50,880
Look.

852
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:56,978
The developers are on my ass, okay?
I just need you to bridge me.

853
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:59,313
What about the money
from Sagamir Road?

854
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,233
What do you think?
I put it into the new properties.

855
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,732
What did you think,
it was just gonna shoot up in perpetuity?

856
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,188
Don't patronize your mother,
Jacob Lawrence.

857
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:09,148
Of course I know
the risks involved.

858
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:12,326
Hey, you're buying diamonds.
You got the bonus, right?

859
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:14,199
I remember visiting you
when I was young

860
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:16,030
at the hospital
after school, thinking,

861
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:18,537
""How cool is this?
My mother is saving lives.""

862
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,663
Don't change the subject.
I'm not changing the subject.

863
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:22,291
I never saved any lives.

864
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,337
Yeah, but you did something,
and that's the point, Mom.

865
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:28,168
I make more in a month now than
I did in my best year as a nurse.

866
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,843
You made a difference.

867
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,843
Listen to the broker preaching
making a difference.

868
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:35,508
That's ironic.

869
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:38,102
How much?

870
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,646
Two hundred, tops.

871
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:45,275
You're killing me, Ma!

872
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:50,447
I'll wire it to you.

873
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:55,243
Can you stop, please?

874
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:57,617
You're not doing her
any favors.

875
00:47:57,917 --> 00:47:59,407
I know.

876
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:03,123
And you're not preventing it
from happening again.

877
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,377
I'll shut up.

878
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,133
Yeah?
- Guess what?

879
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,592
Your boy, Bretton James?

880
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:17,720
His assistant just called me and
asked if you can see him today.

881
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:18,801
You're kidding me.

882
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,096
Jake, you have an hour.
I told him you were on the island.

883
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:24,022
Yeah, but I'm in the middle
of Friday afternoon traffic.

884
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,896
But he said
after hours is okay,

885
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,977
because he left
his home address.

886
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:30,814
East 65th Street and Park Avenue, honey.
Up to 8 p.m.

887
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:31,943
Did he sound upset?

888
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,899
Screw him,
he destroyed this company.

889
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,610
You waltz in there like
Russell Crowe in Gladiator.

890
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:37,911
Thanks, babe.

891
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:42,040
Sounds like you're getting
your walking papers.

892
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:47,079
Jake, look,
I don't need this ring now.

893
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,039
Just give me one out of
a Cracker Jack box instead...

894
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:50,591
What are you talking about?

895
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:52,339
Are you crazy?
Everything's gonna be fine.

896
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,921
Jake, I grew up with a father
who only talked about money.

897
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,130
If you think I want to be
with the kind of guy

898
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:57,931
with his ego invested
in his bank account,

899
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,007
you really don't get me.

900
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:04,597
""I love it,""
was what I was expecting.

901
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:07,767
Return it.
It makes me uncomfortable.

902
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:09,648
Okay, Winnie.
I'll return it.

903
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:26,043
Jacob Moore to
see Mr. James.

904
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,037
He's expecting you.

905
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,450
Saturno Devorando A Su Hijo.

906
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:02,155
Goya painted 15 Black Paintings late in his life.

907
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,535
Fourteen of them are
on view in the Prado.

908
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:06,834
That's the missing 1 5th.

909
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:10,254
An early sketch
for Saturn devouring his son.

910
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:16,006
Do you collect?

911
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,336
No.

912
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:20,343
Only the obsessive-compulsive
and the insecurely egotistical

913
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,140
feel the need
to collect things.

914
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:30,266
Do you ride?

915
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:34,695
It's an avocation, yes.

916
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,696
You know the photograph.

917
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:39,491
Rollie Free, 1948.

918
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,739
He set
the world record at 150.

919
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,367
And wanted it so bad
he rode naked.

920
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:47,166
Why, you ride, Mr. Moore?

921
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,045
I'll put it to you this way.

922
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,464
If you rode
the rest of your life, right,

923
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,793
and really became
the best that you could be,

924
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,297
you would never ride
like I ride.

925
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:03,516
Well, then I look forward
to us riding together.

926
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:11,148
You a bee, Mr. Moore?

927
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,311
A what?

928
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:21,025
Do you like to
sting people?

929
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:27,866
You cost Churchill Schwartz
$120 million last week.

930
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:31,752
That's not
a great deal of money.

931
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:35,206
But people know
Hydra Offshore is ours.

932
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:46,426
I had dinner with the good Commander
Ojukwa in Paris last week.

933
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,854
He has no actual plans of
nationalizing any oil fields.

934
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:53,061
But I guess that doesn't
really matter to you.

935
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:56,188
No, it doesn't.

936
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,271
I checked you out
with the desks in town.

937
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,356
You didn't
make any money off it.

938
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:02,032
No, I didn't.

939
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,531
Then why?

940
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,121
Because you
destroyed my firm.

941
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,288
Your firm
destroyed itself.

942
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,707
You killed Louis Zabel.

943
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,293
Louis Zabel killed himself.

944
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,460
But you set the rumors.

945
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:15,537
The rumors were true.

946
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:17,794
You made them true.

947
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:19,545
No, Mr. Moore.

948
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:23,967
Putting 50% leverage on
toxic debt made them true.

949
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:26,720
Look, Zabel once knew
how to run money.

950
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,801
Dying because of it
was his choice.

951
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:31,603
As far as I'm concerned,
it's just money.

952
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:34,181
But when you don't know
what you're doing,

953
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:36,141
it's fatal, Mr. Moore.

954
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,443
Not knowing
what you're doing.

955
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,784
Come work for me.

956
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,325
What?

957
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,328
We fund most of the world's
integrated oil companies,

958
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:55,161
drillers, coal producers,
natural gas line providers...

959
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,836
I know who you are.

960
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:58,755
But where
we're a little light

961
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:02,418
is in alternative energy.

962
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,221
Why me?

963
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:08,553
Because your loyalty
demanded revenge.

964
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:12,353
Your balls actually attempted it,
and your skill pulled it off.

965
00:53:13,399 --> 00:53:14,730
And frankly,

966
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:19,526
because I'd love to beat the
crap out of you on a bike.

967
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,023
Fair enough?

968
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:26,863
You got my attention, Mr.
Moore. That's pretty rare.

969
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:30,871
If I were you,
I'd think seriously about it.

970
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:33,415
Because you'll have
a hard time elsewhere,

971
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:35,959
now that you've
captured our attention.

972
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:40,005
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm having a little fundraiser.

973
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,877
I got to get back to
shaking my tin cup.

974
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,219
What's your number?

975
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,637
I'm sorry?

976
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:50,766
We'd start you at 300,
like everybody else.

977
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:53,265
I mean, as a partner,
I only pull in 600. And the bonuses...

978
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,811
No, no, no.

979
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:56,392
Your number.

980
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,182
The amount of money
you would need

981
00:53:58,277 --> 00:54:00,643
to just walk away from it
and live.

982
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:02,069
See, I find that
everybody has a number,

983
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:03,396
and it's usually
an exact number.

984
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,481
So what is yours?

985
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:10,986
More.

986
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:32,011
How did you know
it was Bretton James?

987
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,343
Good morning to you, too.
Come in.

988
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:35,928
Good morning.
You hungry?

989
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:37,604
No. I'm okay, thanks.

990
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:43,105
Brett, as I called him in the old days,

991
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:44,312
used to run trades
through me.

992
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:47,523
We used to piggyback
off each other's ideas.

993
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,612
Then we had
a little discrepancy.

994
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,944
I won't bother you
with the details.

995
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:55,452
Just to tell you that
it cost me 200,000 bucks,

996
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,783
which was a lot of money back then.

997
00:54:57,878 --> 00:54:59,368
So when I got hot
in the '80s,

998
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:02,045
and I started giving
tastes to my friends,

999
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:06,171
I didn't invite James in,
and he didn't like that very much.

1000
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:07,801
So?

1001
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:11,088
So
it's no big deal.

1002
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:15,476
But when you're in prison,
you got a lot of time to think.

1003
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:22,232
In fact,
the best memory that I know is hurt.

1004
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:25,857
I did eight years, pal.
Five years before that in court.

1005
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:29,987
Nobody does eight years.
They give murderers five.

1006
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:34,244
I thought it was the kid with
the airline that gave you up.

1007
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,697
Blue Star? Stock Watch?
What was it?

1008
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:38,328
Who, Bud Fox?
Bud Fox.

1009
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,908
No, no, no.
He got a wire on him.

1010
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,493
He got me for
insider trading.

1011
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,250
But that's
12, 13 months, max.

1012
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,706
After the first charges,

1013
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:49,339
it was one of my co-conspirators
who tipped off the Feds.

1014
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:53,840
And that pious piranha,
Bretton James,

1015
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:56,926
he had just enough
information to sink me.

1016
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,636
You know, of course,
I'm never going to know it for sure.

1017
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:02,435
He offered me a job.

1018
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:10,732
Well, you just rocketed into
the center of the universe, pal.

1019
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:14,614
I think my daughter's future is
looking a hell of a lot better.

1020
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:16,908
I never made any money
shorting Hydra.

1021
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:19,289
You're kidding me.
You didn't trade it?

1022
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:22,410
That would've been insider trading,
Mr. Gekko.

1023
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:24,498
Remember, your daughter and I are engaged.

1024
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,501
You wouldn't want to
soil her name, right?

1025
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:28,503
Well,
you may not have traded,

1026
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:31,711
but you try telling the Feds
you didn't commit a felony.

1027
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:32,840
What do you mean?

1028
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:34,341
You know exactly
what I mean.

1029
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:39,177
You induced others to trade on
information that you knew to be false.

1030
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:47,108
Hard to prove that.

1031
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:53,698
A fisherman always sees
another fisherman from afar.

1032
00:56:57,164 --> 00:57:00,622
I think you ought to
start calling me Gordon.

1033
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:03,158
Well, I promised
you this,

1034
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,285
Gordon.

1035
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:06,453
Makes us even.

1036
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:08,580
There she is.

1037
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,290
But keep this
between us, though.

1038
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:14,169
How is that lefty
website of hers doing?

1039
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,674
Frozen Truth?
Yeah.

1040
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:18,758
It's doing well, actually.
They get about 50,000 hits a day.

1041
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,342
It's building.
Mmm.

1042
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,016
She was such a pisser.

1043
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:28,271
Relationships,
they're like bubbles.

1044
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:31,195
They're fragile.
It's like these tulips.

1045
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:34,774
This is the greatest bubble story of all time.

1046
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,985
Back in the 1 600s, the Dutch,
they get speculation fever

1047
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,036
to the point
that you could buy

1048
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,622
a beautiful house
on a canal in Amsterdam,

1049
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,701
for the price of one bulb.

1050
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,878
They called it
""Tulip Mania.""

1051
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:50,414
Then it collapsed.

1052
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:52,215
You could buy
10 bulbs for $2.

1053
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:55,544
People got wiped out, but,
you know, who remembers?

1054
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:57,800
What would you do
with your money?

1055
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,807
Me? Switzerland.
Still the best.

1056
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:04,144
Got a healthy distrust
for a big government.

1057
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:06,643
Is that where
you keep it?

1058
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:10,317
Yes, I did. Now I don't got
that kind of cash anymore.

1059
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:14,066
But you do have money.

1060
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,275
This is a rental.

1061
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:21,737
I'm pretty sure
James has invested

1062
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:24,073
in an offshore fund
in the Caymans.

1063
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,953
Your time,
you ever do anything

1064
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:27,750
with some company
called Locust Fund?

1065
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:31,501
Locust Fund. I never heard of it,
but it's possible. Yeah.

1066
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:34,003
James wants to build his
alternative energy sector.

1067
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:35,174
Sounds serious.

1068
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:36,752
I think I can get him
to put real capital

1069
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,303
behind this company
I told you about.

1070
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,096
United Fusion.

1071
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:43,596
James would probably want to
polish his resume a little green.

1072
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:45,143
He's in pole position
to be top dog

1073
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:47,012
when Julie Steinhardt
kicks the bucket,

1074
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:49,143
which, I hear,
could be any day now.

1075
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:52,351
This company could change not just the
energy market, Gordon, but the world.

1076
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,362
Idealism. Idealism,
pal, it kills every deal.

1077
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:57,861
The thing you got to know about James is,
he's a gambler.

1078
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,031
You know, like me.

1079
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:03,237
He's got an ego the size of Antarctica.
Like me.

1080
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,072
So now you got his attention.

1081
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:07,874
How are you going to shine
sitting on his sun?

1082
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:13,289
Make him money
and melt his ass.

1083
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:18,802
Just like the old days.
We slaughtered men for payback.

1084
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:24,304
Maybe it's time for us
to do our second trade?

1085
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:29,013
All right.
I'll dig around on James and this Locust Fund,

1086
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:30,722
and you see what
you can do about

1087
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,682
getting Winnie and me
back together again.

1088
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:36,316
Well, I never guaranteed
she'd forgive you, Gordon.

1089
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:39,864
Why don't we just start with her agreeing
to have dinner with you first, huh?

1090
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:43,785
Well, at my age,
I'll take anything I can get.

1091
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:48,702
I had two
beautiful children.

1092
00:59:50,212 --> 00:59:53,875
And then I went away,
and I didn't see them much.

1093
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,999
My ex made sure of that.

1094
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:01,052
And then when we lost Rudy,

1095
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:06,641
Winnie just
shut down on me.

1096
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:20,105
Except for
the exceedingly precious

1097
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,612
and depreciating
asset of time.

1098
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:25,448
Winnie's all I got left.
You understand that?

1099
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:27,825
I'll try, Gordon.

1100
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:32,876
Well, try harder.
Then you both can have a father.

1101
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:47,303
He chose this place?
Yeah.

1102
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:50,306
Yeah, we used to come here
every Sunday night.

1103
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:52,012
You're going to be fine.

1104
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:54,393
You do know I'm never
having sex with you again.

1105
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:59,028
Then what my friends say about
marriage is actually true. Five back.

1106
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:00,399
I'm only doing this
for you.

1107
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,651
No, baby. You're doing
this for you. Come on.

1108
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:04,449
Taxi!

1109
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:21,375
Hi.

1110
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:23,543
Hey.

1111
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,382
Mr. Gekko.

1112
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:27,930
Jacob Moore.
We spoke on the phone.

1113
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:29,261
Yeah.

1114
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:36,981
Okay.

1115
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:42,604
Drinks?

1116
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:45,273
No.

1117
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:47,280
What about you?
Heineken?

1118
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,576
Yeah, sure.

1119
01:01:57,297 --> 01:02:01,131
Let me guess.
The ginger-garlic lobster.

1120
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,964
I used to order that
every time.

1121
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:07,971
I guess so.

1122
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:14,636
I checked out that website.

1123
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:17,021
Frozen Truth.
It's impressive.

1124
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,895
Thanks.
We work hard at it.

1125
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:23,023
Although,
there was a bullshit blog

1126
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,854
blaming
the current administration

1127
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,611
for the entire mess
that we're in.

1128
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:28,237
I don't think
that's the truth.

1129
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:29,443
I agree with you.

1130
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:30,568
You do?

1131
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:31,699
Yeah.
Jack Salmon wrote it...

1132
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:32,820
Graydy.

1133
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:35,077
Congratulations.
Great to see you.

1134
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,533
You're doing
great work down there.

1135
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,457
Um. Thank you. Thank you so much.
Gordon. Gordon Gekko.

1136
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,037
Nice to see you.
Thanks so much.

1137
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,435
I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

1138
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,000
Winnie!

1139
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,211
Why did you make me
do that, Jake?

1140
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:23,960
You don't understand.
This is none of your business.

1141
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,460
It is my business.
Stop for a second.

1142
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:26,632
Look at
the real man in there.

1143
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,631
He's hurting.
He's desperate to get you back in his life.

1144
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:30,633
He's not who you
think he is, Jake!

1145
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:33,466
People change.
It was a long time ago. Winnie.

1146
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:39,228
He'll hurt us.

1147
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,641
Don't go back in there.

1148
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:53,067
Are we really going to lead
with this Babaco Solar?

1149
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:56,704
It's a hustle, Bretton.
I passed on it twice within the last two years.

1150
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:58,247
They spin a sexy story

1151
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:00,326
with these super-thin cadmium
telluride semiconductors,

1152
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,126
but the truth is,
the technology is not proprietary...

1153
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:04,670
We've been over this, Bretton.
You are unbelievable, Moore.

1154
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:06,464
Babaco is a cow.
It's dead in the water.

1155
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:08,291
The Chinese aren't stupid.
They're not going to go for it.

1156
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:09,341
Yeah, a cash cow maybe.

1157
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:11,590
They've been saying fusion is five
years away for the last 40 years.

1158
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:12,841
It is.
Laser fusion is the future.

1159
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:14,172
Can you prove that,
boy genius?

1160
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:15,427
Can you prove evolution,
girl genius?

1161
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:16,678
That seems to work,
though, right?

1162
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,351
Look, knock it off.
Both of you.

1163
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:20,394
These guys are parking
15 billion across the board

1164
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:21,517
in energy sectors

1165
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:23,644
and I want them here, okay?

1166
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:25,066
Carol's taking
the lead on this.

1167
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:28,145
Our recommend is Babaco.
That's final.

1168
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:33,366
Go ahead.
I'll take you to dinner some other time.

1169
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:34,989
Oh, eat me, Moore.

1170
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:38,454
Babaco is at the forefront of
developing thin film technology

1171
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:41,874
to incorporate solar cells
into pliable plastic sheets.

1172
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:45,419
We believe that within the next few
years we can approach the 20% level

1173
01:04:45,507 --> 01:04:49,045
making it a perfect match for the
explosion of growth and energy needs,

1174
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:51,501
which, as you know,
is growing at 40%.

1175
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:55,051
Thin film technology
is the breakthrough here.

1176
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,841
And in 2010,

1177
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:01,227
thin film is going to
surpass crystalline silicon.

1178
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:02,974
And that's about it.

1179
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,187
Go ahead.

1180
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:08,643
So, with the world
energy demand

1181
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:11,400
growing 40%
in the next 20 years,

1182
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:13,482
we at Church believe,
Mr. Xu,

1183
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,909
that Babaco Solar is a cutting-edge no-brainer.

1184
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:19,988
Good for a 20% return
in the next two years

1185
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:23,166
with a 30 to 40% upside
in the next five years.

1186
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:25,960
Thank you, Miss Carol.

1187
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:30,791
Solar will make an important part of our portfolio.

1188
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:36,088
But truthfully, we have seen similar
technology from another firm.

1189
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:39,386
As you know,
China's demand

1190
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:43,345
will more than double
before my daughter turns 21.

1191
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:48,108
So we are looking
for the next 100 years.

1192
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:51,812
Where even my grandson
can spend money.

1193
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:54,363
Do you have anything else
to present to us today?

1194
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:56,365
We've come a long way.

1195
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:00,741
Listen, Wang,

1196
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:04,871
now, we got a great new line
on this shale oil technology.

1197
01:06:06,254 --> 01:06:09,417
Let's just dig a lot deeper for a
price that we think is a good one.

1198
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:12,256
We'll have a complete workup
for you by the end of the month.

1199
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:15,301
All right, Bretton.
That sounds promising.

1200
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:16,844
What about fusion?

1201
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,217
We happen to be working
with a company right now.

1202
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:21,140
It's got all
the hardware in place.

1203
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:22,683
Started by
the Department of Energy.

1204
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:25,182
They share R&D facilities with
the University of California.

1205
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:27,556
It's got a market cap right now of about a billion.

1206
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:28,981
No earnings.

1207
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:31,935
Fusion has been around
a long time.

1208
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:36,527
"Good things takw time."

1209
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:38,741
The simple of it is,

1210
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,114
it's using the intense energy
of some 200 laser beams

1211
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:43,993
focused on a single target the
size of a few grains of rice

1212
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,664
filled with hydrogen fuel.

1213
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:48,118
So the idea being that
when that target combusts

1214
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:50,579
it produces more energy
than it took in.

1215
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:53,039
All the tests
they've done indicate

1216
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:54,590
that they can use
this ignition process

1217
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:57,419
to turn simple seawater
into energy.

1218
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:00,922
It's called Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion

1219
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,133
using the reaction between
hot water on the surface

1220
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:05,685
and cold water beneath
to power the lasers.

1221
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:08,521
So what you wind up with
is unlimited clean energy.

1222
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:11,224
How do you contain
the explosion?

1223
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:13,059
That's a secret I can't really
share with you right now.

1224
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:15,896
Not to be secretive,
but I could probably get you in there for a peek.

1225
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:18,447
Maybe next week,
on your way back to Beijing from DC?

1226
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:22,826
Mr. Wang,
I got you something.

1227
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:24,953
This is American baijiu.

1228
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,742
"Johnnie Walker Blue Label."

1229
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:32,287
Miss Chung, this is for you.
Oh, thank you.

1230
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:42,179
I used to
go with Zabel to China.

1231
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:45,725
Their culture's as much about
manners as it is about business.

1232
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:48,019
They're on the hook, Jake.
That's all I care about.

1233
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,224
Good.

1234
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:51,514
I'll send him
some bamboo flowers

1235
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:54,351
symbolizing continued
growth and prosperity.

1236
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:58,404
You don't always listen so good, Jake,
but you got fight in you.

1237
01:07:58,491 --> 01:07:59,856
I like that.

1238
01:08:13,298 --> 01:08:15,960
I think you might just have something on James.

1239
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:17,915
My friend in Switzerland,
he confirmed

1240
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:20,502
that this Locust Fund,
it exists and it's big.

1241
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:22,633
A billion dollars.
Mmm-hmm?

1242
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,716
It just might be
our friend Bretton

1243
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:27,425
was trading
through his own account,

1244
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,056
outside of
Churchill Schwartz.

1245
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:31,600
Can we get that
on the record?

1246
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:33,522
That's the hard part,
isn't it?

1247
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:40,772
So what are we going to do
about my daughter, Jake?

1248
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,903
I told you, I'm sorry
about the other night.

1249
01:08:42,994 --> 01:08:44,484
Gordon, I can't
control her, you know?

1250
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:45,701
Yeah.

1251
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:49,455
You know, they say
parents are the bones

1252
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:51,624
on which children
sharpen their teeth.

1253
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:54,286
Find another way for me
to get with her.

1254
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,540
You know,
there's got to be...

1255
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:57,793
That dinner that's coming up,
all the Street guys are going?

1256
01:08:57,884 --> 01:08:59,624
The Alzheimer's thing
at the Met.

1257
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:01,459
Yeah. I'm taking her.

1258
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:04,300
I wish I had 1 0K for a seat.

1259
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:07,052
A writer's got to
sell a lot of books for that.

1260
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:10,976
And we both know how
Winnie would react to the fact

1261
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:14,306
that you've been bonding
with your future father-in-law.

1262
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,061
Is that a threat?

1263
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:18,567
Absolutely.

1264
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,361
Huh.

1265
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:22,902
Well, consider it done.

1266
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:24,323
I just got to put you
at another table.

1267
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:25,695
It's got to look
like an accident.

1268
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:27,989
I like trading
with you, Jake.

1269
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:30,530
See you around campus.

1270
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:33,332
Hey.

1271
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:35,747
Get her a ring,
for Christ's sake!

1272
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:00,188
How are you, Bill?

1273
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:01,815
Julie, how nice to see you.

1274
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:04,238
Well, it's a pleasure
to see you, William.

1275
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:06,111
So nice to see you.

1276
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:09,827
Have you spoken to J.P.
about the conservancy?

1277
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:19,537
Hi, nice to meet you.
Hi.

1278
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:22,544
Congratulations.
Looks like you won this one.

1279
01:10:24,095 --> 01:10:25,881
Hi.
It's not over yet.

1280
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:28,387
Have you met Jake? Good to see you.
How's your husband?

1281
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:29,509
Very well.

1282
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:33,893
I gotta tell you,
Mr. Gekko,

1283
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,596
seeing you speak was
inspirational on so many levels.

1284
01:10:36,691 --> 01:10:38,227
Because, I'll tell you,
I'm on the outside.

1285
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:40,774
I'm looking at all my buddies
making all this money

1286
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:42,147
and I'm thinking, ""Fellas,

1287
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,980
""there's no there, there.""
You know?

1288
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,154
But listen,
I'm at your table.

1289
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:47,231
We can talk about this
all night.

1290
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:49,908
That's great, Robby.
I'll see you later then, all right?

1291
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:51,361
Hey, Gordon.

1292
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:54,364
Looking good.

1293
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:55,665
My God.

1294
01:10:56,627 --> 01:11:00,040
Bud Fox, huh?
I haven't seen you in years.

1295
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,205
This is
Erin and Christina.

1296
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:03,961
Hi.
Hello. Hi.

1297
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:08,386
What was that airline called?
Blue Star, that's right.

1298
01:11:08,473 --> 01:11:11,055
That must be keeping you
pretty busy now, huh?

1299
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:13,516
Excuse me.

1300
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:19,063
Well, after a little time away,
I actually turned it into

1301
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:22,859
one of the largest private jet
brokerages in the world and sold it.

1302
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:23,934
Made millions.

1303
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:27,147
That's great, pal. That's really great.
So what's up next?

1304
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:30,408
You're looking at it. Golf,

1305
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:34,411
winters in St. Barts,
philanthropy.

1306
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,990
Ah!
And how about you, Gordon?

1307
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:41,081
Does Blue Horseshoe
still love Anacott Steel?

1308
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:43,208
You know it.

1309
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,717
Well, I'll see you around
sometime, Gordon.

1310
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:50,674
Stay out of trouble.

1311
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:47,185
And the website's
called Frozen Truth.

1312
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,611
- Frozen Truth?
- Yeah.

1313
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:50,780
That's catchy.
I like that.

1314
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:53,734
What we really need
is some game-changing news.

1315
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:57,412
And now you can come out
of nowhere with one big story.

1316
01:12:57,498 --> 01:12:59,784
Since ""Mission Accomplished""
broke the Senator's affair,

1317
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:01,958
they've gotten
200,000 hits a day.

1318
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:03,952
Is it expensive to run?

1319
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:05,627
Not really.
It's a shoestring budget.

1320
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:09,082
Maybe Jake can find ways
to raise you some money

1321
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:10,632
flip it to the public?

1322
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:12,710
We don't really want
to go public.

1323
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:14,136
It would affect
our credibility.

1324
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,633
We want to stay non-profit.

1325
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:18,011
Non-profit? What is that?
I don't know what that is.

1326
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:19,558
I've heard the term before,
""non-profit.""

1327
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:20,725
That's very funny.

1328
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:23,429
You know what it is?
Isn't that when you came out of school

1329
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:24,684
and you had to do something
for the government,

1330
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:25,855
Iike it was mandatory?

1331
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:26,932
Very funny.

1332
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:28,268
It was called the draft.

1333
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:29,647
It was called the draft.
It's called the draft.

1334
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:31,525
So one day, Brett,
Churchill Schwartz

1335
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:34,483
is going to buy every table
at this jackal's ball.

1336
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:37,319
They're going to call it
""a religious revival.""

1337
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:41,576
Winn, you don't have to
leave on my behalf.

1338
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:43,203
I'm only going to be here
a couple of seconds.

1339
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:45,080
No. Stay. I'm just
going to get some air.

1340
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,715
If somebody took
this place out tonight,

1341
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:01,892
there'd be nobody left
to rule the world.

1342
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:08,107
But, Brett, congratulations.
I know how hard you worked for all of this.

1343
01:14:08,527 --> 01:14:10,734
I go by ""Bretton""
these days.

1344
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:14,772
It's a beneficiary of a few bull markets.
That's all it takes.

1345
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:17,116
So easy,
even a caveman can do it, right?

1346
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:18,443
That's right.

1347
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:21,870
You make modesty
a virtue, Bretton.

1348
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:26,414
The truth is, nobody needs inside
information anymore to get rich.

1349
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:30,959
All you have to do
is stay out of jail.

1350
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:33,295
Glad to be here, Bretton. Herb.

1351
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:37,629
Actually, jail was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1352
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:38,758
Oh, yeah?

1353
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:39,838
Got me to think.

1354
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,091
It centers a man.

1355
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:45,807
I probably should thank
whoever put me in there.

1356
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,601
You know,
I saw you on television the other night.

1357
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:54,562
You are quite the bear.

1358
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:56,572
You be careful, you know.

1359
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:59,321
Your daughter's financial
health is now in our hands.

1360
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:01,824
So it is, so it is.
Yeah, it is.

1361
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:04,906
But your firm knows
sub-primes are crap.

1362
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:09,335
The way you keep buying
Bernie's insurance swaps lately,

1363
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:13,415
I mean, I gotta worry about my
grandchildren's college education.

1364
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:15,837
We like insurance.

1365
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:17,134
What's not to like?

1366
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:20,679
Easy selling crack to kids
in a school playground.

1367
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,431
Credit default swap
is a good idea.

1368
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,179
It's the execution
that isn't.

1369
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:26,685
Well, you know
what they say.

1370
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:28,933
Bulls make money,
bears make money,

1371
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:31,182
and the pigs,
they get slaughtered.

1372
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:33,981
I thought this was
a charity event, Gordon.

1373
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:36,437
Why don't you go find some?

1374
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:40,449
Tell you what.
I'll make you a deal, Bretton.

1375
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,156
You stop
telling lies about me,

1376
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:45,371
I'll stop telling
the truth about you.

1377
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:56,544
That's sad.

1378
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:58,546
Isn't it?

1379
01:15:58,637 --> 01:15:59,592
It's pathetic.

1380
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,966
That he can't just take his ball and go home.

1381
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:04,470
He has to piss
on the whole game.

1382
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:08,431
I'm going to go find Winnie.

1383
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:10,353
Oh, look, by the way,

1384
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:13,061
I talked to Wang today.

1385
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:18,487
I think the Chinese
are close. Very close.

1386
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,816
In any case,
I want to talk to you about the future,

1387
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:23,902
about how we're going to
bring this over the top.

1388
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:25,236
Sure.
Okay?

1389
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:27,071
Tomorrow?
Possibly tomorrow.

1390
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:28,497
Okay. Okay.
All right.

1391
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:36,918
Hi.

1392
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:47,098
He's a good kid.

1393
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:49,598
He came from nothing.

1394
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:51,804
Hustler, like me.

1395
01:16:55,486 --> 01:16:58,068
You think he's
the one for you, Winn?

1396
01:16:58,739 --> 01:16:59,819
Yep.

1397
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:04,025
Well, just make sure
he's worthy of you

1398
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:07,738
because, whether you like it or not,
you're still a Gekko.

1399
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:12,537
And whether
you like it or not

1400
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:15,335
that name doesn't mean
anything anymore.

1401
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:21,042
Why do you say
something like that?

1402
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,676
We had an agreement.

1403
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:27,097
You remember?
Last time you came down to see me?

1404
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:29,300
We were going to
take a little trip.

1405
01:17:29,395 --> 01:17:32,558
When I got out, you remember that?
To Switzerland?

1406
01:17:32,857 --> 01:17:34,313
Yeah.

1407
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,186
That was before Rudy.

1408
01:17:40,781 --> 01:17:44,239
Some of the things that came
out after you went away,

1409
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:49,074
things you were recorded saying,
the affairs?

1410
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:53,199
That wasn't you. That wasn't my father.
It was some sociopath.

1411
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:54,909
It was nine years ago.
So?

1412
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:56,585
When are you going to stop?

1413
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:05,719
You got no idea what hell
I went through in there.

1414
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:08,343
Hell, for you?
It was hell for you?

1415
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:10,015
Do you know what
you did to Rudy?

1416
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:12,343
To all of us?
You drove Mom mad.

1417
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:13,473
Winnie,

1418
01:18:14,315 --> 01:18:16,055
he was my only son.

1419
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:21,773
I tried everything.
I put him in the 1 2-step deal.

1420
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:24,822
I never told you,
I borrowed money from hardcore guys.

1421
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:27,696
Tens of thousands of dollars,
which I didn't have.

1422
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:31,537
I gave it to the best therapist I could find.

1423
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:34,119
I even tried to pay off
one scumbag dealer

1424
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:36,622
not to sell any more
to my boy!

1425
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:40,708
But if you'd
been there, Dad...

1426
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:45,964
If you hadn't been in prison,

1427
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:48,304
it would've been different.

1428
01:18:49,808 --> 01:18:52,891
Winnie, you got no idea

1429
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:55,761
how much I beat myself up,

1430
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:58,472
how many mistakes
I made as a father.

1431
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,145
Rudy...

1432
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:04,145
He was a victim, you know.
Like, he had cancer.

1433
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,980
You cannot blame me.

1434
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:10,030
And you gotta stop
blaming yourself.

1435
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:23,130
You're all
I got left, honey.

1436
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:26,462
Nothing else

1437
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:28,961
matters.

1438
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:36,014
I cannot make it right again,
but I can make things better.

1439
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:39,851
I'm your dad.

1440
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:44,685
And whatever you say
till the day that I die,

1441
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:47,605
you're my gal.

1442
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:51,196
You're the only one.

1443
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:53,694
You're my baby.

1444
01:19:58,752 --> 01:20:00,208
Please.

1445
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:04,872
Winnie,
just try to forgive me.

1446
01:20:20,024 --> 01:20:21,059
Dad.

1447
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:40,873
It's done, Doc.

1448
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:43,289
Look, you're an older guy,
so I don't want you to have a heart attack.

1449
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:46,497
But Bretton James just said
we're gonna get a $100 million!

1450
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,627
DR. MASTERS:
Are you serious, my boy?

1451
01:20:47,718 --> 01:20:48,673
Yes!

1452
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:50,592
Bretton says
the Chinese are close!

1453
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:53,095
But look, you get some sleep,
all right? You deserve it.

1454
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:54,547
Thank you, Jacob.

1455
01:20:54,641 --> 01:20:55,972
I'll talk to you soon.

1456
01:21:34,765 --> 01:21:37,347
There is carnage
on Wall Street.

1457
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:39,971
The shares of the major
financial stocks plummeting.

1458
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:42,761
It's triggering a major sell-off in the markets.

1459
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:44,141
The damage, widespread.

1460
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:45,222
The NASDAQ's plunging.

1461
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:46,682
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is plunging,

1462
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:48,108
and oil is plunging.

1463
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:50,318
Literally a 180 points
just added to the decline.

1464
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:52,233
You can hear
the hollering on the floor.

1465
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:55,236
We're down 260,
literally in a split second.

1466
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:57,113
Right now,
the Dow Jones Industrial Average

1467
01:21:57,204 --> 01:21:59,911
is now 500 points
on the decline.

1468
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:02,156
The headline of the new housing report is grim

1469
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:04,199
that this is
shaping up to be the worst

1470
01:22:04,294 --> 01:22:06,080
real estate market
in a generation.

1471
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:08,127
We are now at
the highest point there, 724.

1472
01:22:08,215 --> 01:22:10,251
That was the biggest loss
we've seen today.

1473
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:11,957
We're now in
historic territory.

1474
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:14,634
Investors are getting
their heads handed to them

1475
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:17,758
as another US banking
institution nears collapse.

1476
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:20,683
The President's Working Group is
going into emergency meetings

1477
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,259
with the Secretary
of the Treasury

1478
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:23,844
and the Federal
Reserve Board.

1479
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:35,735
The President's Chief of Staff
is calling back in an hour.

1480
01:22:35,826 --> 01:22:37,111
He's with the President.

1481
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:40,786
And he's going to want to know
what I think we should do.

1482
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:43,993
This isn't
Keller Zabel, Bill.

1483
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:48,122
This is too big to fail.

1484
01:22:48,255 --> 01:22:50,086
This is just
an insane situation.

1485
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:51,459
This is now.

1486
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:54,587
There's about 70-plus trillion out
there in credit default swaps

1487
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:56,009
held by roughly 17 banks.

1488
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:58,303
And we do not know
where the bottom is.

1489
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:02,140
How much are
you guys thinking?

1490
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:04,183
At least five.

1491
01:23:04,271 --> 01:23:06,307
I think six.

1492
01:23:06,398 --> 01:23:09,640
Bill, I frankly think
Harry and Charlie are low.

1493
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:11,896
I think we're
talking seven, eight.

1494
01:23:12,029 --> 01:23:13,610
Hundred billion?

1495
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:21,531
Selling this to Congress
is the problem.

1496
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,492
They're going to want to know
where the money's going.

1497
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:26,790
They'll jawbone
this to death.

1498
01:23:29,796 --> 01:23:31,411
Scare them.
- How?

1499
01:23:32,299 --> 01:23:34,085
Tell them the truth.

1500
01:23:34,635 --> 01:23:37,593
The government's got to
restore confidence.

1501
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:40,554
If we don't stop the bleeding,
in three days,

1502
01:23:40,641 --> 01:23:43,257
half the banks in this room
are out of business.

1503
01:23:43,352 --> 01:23:45,764
And in five days,
we're all gone.

1504
01:23:47,564 --> 01:23:50,180
You men realize
what you've done here?

1505
01:23:52,277 --> 01:23:54,609
You are asking for
the biggest bailout

1506
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:56,982
in the history
of this country.

1507
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:00,775
You're talking
nationalization, Bretton.

1508
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:02,943
Socialism.

1509
01:24:05,499 --> 01:24:09,287
I have fought it all my life.

1510
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:12,832
And if we don't get it, Bill,

1511
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:15,130
there won't be any history.

1512
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:16,999
Music stops.

1513
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:19,880
Ball's over.

1514
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:25,052
Julie?

1515
01:24:26,812 --> 01:24:28,268
1929.

1516
01:24:30,357 --> 01:24:33,315
It'll get worse now,
because it'll go faster.

1517
01:24:34,111 --> 01:24:38,730
Money markets will dry up around
the world by the end of the week.

1518
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:41,816
ATMs will stop
spitting bills.

1519
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:46,070
Federal Deposit
Insurance will collapse.

1520
01:24:46,957 --> 01:24:48,948
Banks will close.

1521
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:50,748
Mobs, panic.

1522
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:57,456
It's going to be
the end of the world, Bill.

1523
01:25:01,888 --> 01:25:02,968
See?

1524
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:08,182
Huh!

1525
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,519
All right, boys.

1526
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:14,852
You'll hear from us tonight.

1527
01:25:17,195 --> 01:25:18,184
What is going to
happen here?

1528
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:20,271
Does government
have to get involved?

1529
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:23,232
Are we potentially at a point
where we might actually lose

1530
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:25,238
the financial system
as we know it?

1531
01:25:25,329 --> 01:25:27,285
If the government
doesn 't get involved,

1532
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:28,987
there is a risk of
a global meltdown

1533
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:30,663
of the global
financial system.

1534
01:25:30,751 --> 01:25:32,036
This is
a financial crisis,

1535
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:35,085
and anyone who doesn 't admit
that is just kidding themselves.

1536
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:37,044
We've seen something like this.
- Polly, I disagree.

1537
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:39,464
You've gotta get the government
to say no in a situation like this.

1538
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:42,258
True capitalism is about disaster and correction.

1539
01:25:42,346 --> 01:25:43,586
It's a natural cycle.

1540
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,136
Without it,
you create all kinds

1541
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:46,383
of artificial anomalies
in the market.

1542
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:47,555
But if we don 't
fix this now,

1543
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:49,133
you're going to have...

1544
01:25:49,227 --> 01:25:52,344
This is something this country
hasn 't experienced before.

1545
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:54,187
It's an economic Pearl Harbor.

1546
01:25:54,274 --> 01:25:56,014
We got to figure out some way
to put the fire out.

1547
01:25:56,109 --> 01:25:58,225
And that means government...

1548
01:26:03,617 --> 01:26:05,733
Your father
predicted this.

1549
01:26:08,955 --> 01:26:10,115
When I was little,

1550
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:13,828
I'd hear my dad in the kitchen late at night.

1551
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:16,580
His case was on appeal.

1552
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:22,336
I'd go and sit with him.
We'd eat ice cream.

1553
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:26,170
I never knew him
as a peaceful person.

1554
01:26:28,558 --> 01:26:30,298
It always scared me.

1555
01:26:31,395 --> 01:26:32,885
This is scary.

1556
01:26:34,106 --> 01:26:36,017
What's going to happen?

1557
01:26:38,235 --> 01:26:39,896
It'll be the end.

1558
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:45,901
Well, that's unacceptable.

1559
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:48,533
Why?

1560
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:51,244
Because I'm pregnant, Jake.

1561
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:03,794
You're pregnant?
Yeah.

1562
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:13,100
When the lake's on fire

1563
01:27:13,186 --> 01:27:14,801
That's fantastic.

1564
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:18,309
With all the world's desires

1565
01:27:18,984 --> 01:27:22,101
Compact, relaxed

1566
01:27:23,655 --> 01:27:27,819
Intact, give thanks

1567
01:27:28,452 --> 01:27:34,493
I'm counting
all the possibilities

1568
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:41,878
And we are talking
on the S&P 500

1569
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:44,672
a loss of almost
eight percent in one day,

1570
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,297
surpassing
September 1 7th, 2001.

1571
01:27:47,387 --> 01:27:50,754
That's the day markets opened
after the attacks of 9/11.

1572
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:52,259
...Iast night on Wall Street

1573
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:55,262
and swept through Japan, China,
India and Europe

1574
01:27:55,353 --> 01:27:59,517
after one of the worst days on global
stock markets in modern times.

1575
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:46,017
They said your office.

1576
01:28:47,906 --> 01:28:51,194
It's too depressing today.
This is my other office.

1577
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:54,951
This might be dangerous.
Think you can keep up?

1578
01:28:55,121 --> 01:28:57,237
World's crashing anyway.
We'll see, right?

1579
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:22,201
That's not bad, Jake.

1580
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:25,291
Though I think they might
have given you the faster bike.

1581
01:30:25,378 --> 01:30:27,494
I'm sure
that's what it was.

1582
01:30:29,007 --> 01:30:30,247
You know,

1583
01:30:30,926 --> 01:30:32,666
I've always believed
that a man should have,

1584
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:34,797
at one time or another
in his life,

1585
01:30:34,888 --> 01:30:37,220
both a mentor
and a protege.

1586
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:38,717
Who's yours?

1587
01:30:38,808 --> 01:30:40,844
The man who brought me
into Churchill Schwartz.

1588
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:42,142
Bill Clark at Treasury.

1589
01:30:42,228 --> 01:30:45,345
He's been a good friend to us during this crisis.

1590
01:30:46,066 --> 01:30:48,557
You got the makings
of a leader, Jake.

1591
01:30:48,652 --> 01:30:52,019
I just want you to know,
there's no hard feelings on this.

1592
01:30:52,781 --> 01:30:54,487
No one's going to lose.

1593
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:56,940
With Clark in,
I think we're in good shape.

1594
01:30:57,035 --> 01:30:58,775
You got a great future.

1595
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:00,576
I don't understand.

1596
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:03,121
Didn't you read this morning's
capital breakdown?

1597
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:06,541
No, I came right up to the roof.
Why? What happened?

1598
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:13,999
Look, the Chinese money,
it's going to Babaco Solar.

1599
01:31:16,054 --> 01:31:18,010
What?
We took another look

1600
01:31:18,098 --> 01:31:19,304
and we just don't
think United Fusion

1601
01:31:19,391 --> 01:31:20,801
is ever gonna
achieve what they claim.

1602
01:31:20,892 --> 01:31:23,258
Babaco needs this money to
build these three fabrications...

1603
01:31:23,353 --> 01:31:24,638
You might as well
just burn the money, Bretton.

1604
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:27,061
You told me, I told Dr.
Masters. He's expecting it.

1605
01:31:27,148 --> 01:31:29,184
The decision's been made.

1606
01:31:29,275 --> 01:31:31,311
Unless you
want it to die.

1607
01:31:32,445 --> 01:31:33,730
Of course.

1608
01:31:33,822 --> 01:31:36,985
Seawater is in a lot more supply than crude.
Right, Bretton?

1609
01:31:37,075 --> 01:31:38,781
You an idealist
or a capitalist, Jacob?

1610
01:31:38,868 --> 01:31:40,233
I'm a realist.

1611
01:31:41,079 --> 01:31:43,115
You're a real
piece of work, Bretton.

1612
01:31:43,206 --> 01:31:45,367
You're giving the money to
Babaco because it's a hustle.

1613
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:48,325
It's all inside.
That's why your oil companies are safe, right?

1614
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:50,627
The mentor-protege
relationship

1615
01:31:50,714 --> 01:31:53,421
is not emotional
over anything.

1616
01:31:54,426 --> 01:31:56,963
I thought you might be a good addition
to the Churchill Schwartz team.

1617
01:31:57,095 --> 01:31:58,710
Am I mistaken?
Let me tell you something, Bretton.

1618
01:31:58,805 --> 01:32:00,887
You are not my mentor.
Lou Zabel was.

1619
01:32:00,974 --> 01:32:02,089
And whether you
admit it or not,

1620
01:32:02,308 --> 01:32:05,266
your raid destroyed Zabel
and forced him to suicide.

1621
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:08,971
So you may talk about moral hazard.
You are the moral hazard.

1622
01:32:09,441 --> 01:32:13,434
You are the worst kind of toxic
debt this system's polluted with.

1623
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:16,523
Is this a threat?

1624
01:32:16,614 --> 01:32:17,694
Absolutely.

1625
01:32:25,665 --> 01:32:27,701
This is so disappointing.

1626
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:31,117
I really saw
so much in you, Jacob.

1627
01:32:32,756 --> 01:32:34,792
You should look in the mirror first.
See yourself.

1628
01:32:34,883 --> 01:32:37,499
It might scare you, Bretton.

1629
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:44,256
Consider the motorcycle
part of your severance.

1630
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:46,011
Fuck you, Bretton!

1631
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:54,182
- Here you are.
- Thanks a lot.

1632
01:32:54,277 --> 01:32:55,392
Hi. For Elise.

1633
01:32:55,487 --> 01:32:56,476
""For Elise.""

1634
01:32:56,571 --> 01:32:58,232
And can I ask you
a question, Mr. Gekko?

1635
01:32:58,323 --> 01:32:59,438
Certainly, Elise.

1636
01:32:59,532 --> 01:33:01,898
What exactly is
""moral hazard""?

1637
01:33:01,993 --> 01:33:03,028
He screwed me.

1638
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:04,154
Excuse me?

1639
01:33:05,288 --> 01:33:06,368
Shocker.

1640
01:33:06,456 --> 01:33:09,664
He saw that fusion was actually possible,
so he killed it.

1641
01:33:09,751 --> 01:33:11,833
Well, that's a little
far-fetched.

1642
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,332
But then, these days,
anything is possible.

1643
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:16,208
Well, I quit, Gordon.

1644
01:33:16,925 --> 01:33:20,838
That's really going to help.
I'll see you outside in 15 minutes.

1645
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:24,049
Moral hazard,
that's when somebody

1646
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:27,177
takes your money and is not responsible for it.

1647
01:33:28,228 --> 01:33:32,096
This guy James,
he must walk between raindrops.

1648
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:34,852
He's a monkey
dancing on a razorblade.

1649
01:33:35,777 --> 01:33:40,362
Not only did he start the rumors at
Zabel to get your bank for peanuts,

1650
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:43,110
the guy was trading for his own
account in this Locust Fund.

1651
01:33:43,201 --> 01:33:44,532
He was?
He was.

1652
01:33:44,661 --> 01:33:48,495
And he was betting against the
market that he was making.

1653
01:33:48,581 --> 01:33:52,415
But the kicker is,
so was his firm.

1654
01:33:52,502 --> 01:33:54,959
Churchill Schwartz
was shorting sub-primes?

1655
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:57,913
Yeah, for the last two years
they've been hedging.

1656
01:33:58,007 --> 01:34:01,750
Not just sub-primes.
Primes, indexes, the whole thing.

1657
01:34:03,346 --> 01:34:05,462
But they knew
this home loan fantasy

1658
01:34:05,557 --> 01:34:07,593
was going to
collapse the market.

1659
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:10,634
And when they did,
they got the Feds

1660
01:34:10,728 --> 01:34:15,688
to bail out their bad insurance swaps,
a 100 cents on the dollar.

1661
01:34:15,859 --> 01:34:19,397
I mean, talk about an evil empire.
This puts me to shame.

1662
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:22,566
And I'm small-time
compared to these crooks.

1663
01:34:24,367 --> 01:34:27,655
The system is insolvent if no
one knows what to do next

1664
01:34:27,745 --> 01:34:31,203
except repeat the insanity
till the next bubble blows.

1665
01:34:32,292 --> 01:34:34,624
That'll be the one.
The big one.

1666
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:38,662
The tipping point,
just like the tulip.

1667
01:34:38,756 --> 01:34:42,590
We could still go after James on this.
Just bring it all out.

1668
01:34:42,677 --> 01:34:44,417
Easy, Trigger.

1669
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:48,004
Media is not going to get in the
way of Churchill or the government.

1670
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:50,841
They want their profits
just like the rest of us.

1671
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:53,017
It's unethical,
but it's not illegal.

1672
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:56,596
When everyone's running for the lifeboats,
who's going to care?

1673
01:34:56,691 --> 01:34:59,228
Maybe some little
leftist website?

1674
01:34:59,319 --> 01:35:01,025
Your daughter will run it.
It'll get some play.

1675
01:35:06,451 --> 01:35:10,694
Look, Bretton is not an enemy a
kid like you wants to have for life.

1676
01:35:10,788 --> 01:35:11,948
Just get out
of this racket.

1677
01:35:12,624 --> 01:35:15,741
Settle down with Winnie.
Live a happy life somewhere.

1678
01:35:15,835 --> 01:35:16,870
What?

1679
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:18,872
Well, you know,
she's got enough money.

1680
01:35:18,963 --> 01:35:20,999
What do you mean?
You're smart.

1681
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:22,626
You'll come up with another way to slice bread.

1682
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:24,173
What money?

1683
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:25,295
My money.

1684
01:35:26,971 --> 01:35:29,257
Stop playing it dumb,
will you, Jake? I know you know.

1685
01:35:29,349 --> 01:35:30,680
Know what?

1686
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:33,800
Are you telling me that you're not the only one

1687
01:35:33,895 --> 01:35:36,511
in this relationship
keeping a secret?

1688
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:40,352
Hold on a second.
What money, Gordon?

1689
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:43,359
Switzerland.

1690
01:35:43,446 --> 01:35:44,561
How much?

1691
01:35:46,491 --> 01:35:49,358
It's close to
$100 million by now.

1692
01:35:53,915 --> 01:35:56,156
What do you say
we split a cab?

1693
01:36:02,423 --> 01:36:06,757
I set it up as a Swiss account
in the '80s before all the trouble.

1694
01:36:06,844 --> 01:36:07,879
Hey, chief.

1695
01:36:08,096 --> 01:36:10,553
Look, I'll pay you extra.
Just slow down.

1696
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:11,880
Can you... Can you...

1697
01:36:11,975 --> 01:36:15,058
When she was 18,
I told her she would come into it all

1698
01:36:15,144 --> 01:36:16,259
when she turned 25.

1699
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:20,267
And she agreed to stake me
when I got out.

1700
01:36:21,234 --> 01:36:24,692
Then Rudy died,
and she reneged.

1701
01:36:24,988 --> 01:36:26,353
She never visited me again.

1702
01:36:27,365 --> 01:36:29,276
She told me
she had a small trust

1703
01:36:29,367 --> 01:36:31,107
from you and her mom,
but she didn't care anything about it.

1704
01:36:31,202 --> 01:36:33,363
She was going to give it to
charity when she was 25.

1705
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:35,740
Well, it's easy for her to say.
She never earned it.

1706
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:40,291
And now you want it
for your fusion delusion.

1707
01:36:40,378 --> 01:36:42,289
But it's a trust. I mean,
she couldn't break into it

1708
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:43,961
before she was 25 anyway.

1709
01:36:44,048 --> 01:36:47,131
Are you as dumb as you sound?
Anything can be revoked.

1710
01:36:47,218 --> 01:36:51,427
They don't got trusts in Switzerland.
It's an account, that's all.

1711
01:36:51,889 --> 01:36:54,722
I know the bank well.
They'll work with me.

1712
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:58,180
But you still need
her signature, of course.

1713
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:03,849
When it comes to money, sport,
your eyes suddenly shine, just like mine.

1714
01:37:06,696 --> 01:37:08,778
Great!
Saved another life, huh?

1715
01:37:09,657 --> 01:37:10,817
Asshole!

1716
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:12,864
Are you crazy?
You want to die? Huh?

1717
01:37:17,623 --> 01:37:18,783
How do we do this?

1718
01:37:21,419 --> 01:37:23,000
She goes with you
to Switzerland,

1719
01:37:23,087 --> 01:37:25,123
she signs the account
over to your control

1720
01:37:25,214 --> 01:37:28,081
then you give me the money and
I'll get it to the States for you.

1721
01:37:28,843 --> 01:37:30,424
You mean launder it?

1722
01:37:30,928 --> 01:37:33,169
Look, pal,
you want the IRS on Winnie?

1723
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:37,348
Because you damn well know she
is complicit and seriously liable.

1724
01:37:37,435 --> 01:37:38,925
All right?
You want the money?

1725
01:37:57,038 --> 01:37:58,323
Hi. How are you?
Hi.

1726
01:37:58,414 --> 01:38:00,029
Can I talk to you
for a second?

1727
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:02,240
Yeah.
I'll be back in a sec.

1728
01:38:04,712 --> 01:38:07,624
Why didn't you tell me
about the $100 million?

1729
01:38:11,052 --> 01:38:15,546
How did you find...
How did you find out in the first place?

1730
01:38:15,807 --> 01:38:17,263
Did you talk to my father?

1731
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:19,557
I found out because Churchill
Schwartz's international trading desk

1732
01:38:19,644 --> 01:38:21,305
handles some of the money,
and your name came up,

1733
01:38:21,396 --> 01:38:22,511
along with Gordon Gekko.

1734
01:38:22,605 --> 01:38:26,723
I never considered it mine. I was 14.
I was a minor when he set it up.

1735
01:38:26,818 --> 01:38:27,933
Yeah, but you didn't do anything with the money

1736
01:38:28,027 --> 01:38:29,142
when you turned
into a major, did you?

1737
01:38:29,153 --> 01:38:31,064
I was going to give it to charity.
Really?

1738
01:38:31,155 --> 01:38:33,692
What were you gonna do,
launder the money yourself, Winnie?

1739
01:38:33,783 --> 01:38:35,023
What was your plan?

1740
01:38:35,118 --> 01:38:37,074
I didn't think about it.

1741
01:38:37,161 --> 01:38:39,026
You didn't think about it?
It was my father's money.

1742
01:38:39,163 --> 01:38:40,994
You know how he got it.
No, you're wrong. It's your money.

1743
01:38:41,082 --> 01:38:43,744
It's $100 million
of your money.

1744
01:38:43,835 --> 01:38:45,325
Do you know
what that means?

1745
01:38:45,837 --> 01:38:49,705
That's five years in jail.
You're gonna get busted with him for tax fraud.

1746
01:38:49,799 --> 01:38:51,755
This is serious, Winnie.

1747
01:38:59,142 --> 01:39:02,009
You could do something good
with this money.

1748
01:39:03,104 --> 01:39:04,969
This is more than
just charity, Winn.

1749
01:39:07,024 --> 01:39:10,266
You might want to wipe some
of the drool off your face, Jake.

1750
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:11,813
Winnie,
if it wasn't important,

1751
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:12,939
I'd totally understand,
but it is.

1752
01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:14,941
You know that
fusion just might work.

1753
01:39:15,032 --> 01:39:17,114
I know it sounds
like Star Wars, love,

1754
01:39:17,201 --> 01:39:18,441
but if it weren't
for crazy people

1755
01:39:18,536 --> 01:39:19,742
who thought
these crazy things

1756
01:39:19,829 --> 01:39:22,821
then where would we be
in this world? Nowhere.

1757
01:39:23,374 --> 01:39:24,454
Huh?

1758
01:39:24,876 --> 01:39:28,118
Winnie, Dr. Masters is a genius.
He's a pioneer.

1759
01:39:28,212 --> 01:39:29,998
They might just solve this thing.
It could change the world.

1760
01:39:30,089 --> 01:39:32,296
Yeah, okay. Is this about changing
the world or making money?

1761
01:39:32,383 --> 01:39:33,964
Because you come into my office,
pitching to me.

1762
01:39:34,051 --> 01:39:35,336
You sound like
a Wall Street guy.

1763
01:39:35,428 --> 01:39:38,420
Hold on for a second!
I am a Wall Street guy.

1764
01:39:38,514 --> 01:39:39,674
I am and I'm good at this.

1765
01:39:39,765 --> 01:39:42,677
And I believe in this.
And you know that I do.

1766
01:39:42,768 --> 01:39:45,054
What do you wanna do,
just report the news for the rest of your life

1767
01:39:45,146 --> 01:39:46,852
or do you want to make the news?
This is your opportunity.

1768
01:39:46,939 --> 01:39:49,225
It's your chance to shine.

1769
01:39:49,317 --> 01:39:51,182
To be Captain America.

1770
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:59,699
This is the most charitable
you could ever be in your life!

1771
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:08,582
You honestly believe in this?

1772
01:40:10,046 --> 01:40:11,582
Let's say I could...

1773
01:40:11,672 --> 01:40:13,663
Let's say I could get the money
now, hypothetically, right?

1774
01:40:13,758 --> 01:40:14,838
Not that you care
about the money.

1775
01:40:14,926 --> 01:40:16,166
But let's say I could take out a loan against it,

1776
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:18,967
minimize your risk
as much as possible.

1777
01:40:19,972 --> 01:40:22,338
Would you
do this for me, Winn?

1778
01:40:24,727 --> 01:40:26,718
Would you do this for me?

1779
01:40:53,005 --> 01:40:54,211
Very well, Miss Gekko.

1780
01:40:54,298 --> 01:40:55,663
We will have
your father co-sign

1781
01:40:55,758 --> 01:40:57,874
and we will see to it that
the funds are transferred.

1782
01:40:57,969 --> 01:40:59,834
Thank you.
Danke schon, Miss Gekko.

1783
01:41:00,263 --> 01:41:01,503
Mr. Moore.
Yes?

1784
01:41:01,597 --> 01:41:03,679
Mr.
Gekko asked that you call him in New York

1785
01:41:03,766 --> 01:41:05,222
as soon as
this meeting is over.

1786
01:41:05,309 --> 01:41:06,640
Thank you.

1787
01:41:08,312 --> 01:41:10,553
So I'll take care of the rest of this.
You go back to the hotel.

1788
01:41:10,648 --> 01:41:11,854
All right.
I just got the confirmation.

1789
01:41:11,941 --> 01:41:13,397
We're on the direct flight to
New York in the morning.

1790
01:41:13,484 --> 01:41:14,644
Great.

1791
01:41:15,653 --> 01:41:16,984
Great news on the loft.
Oh, yeah?

1792
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:20,029
Yeah, I got a buyer.
So one less thing in our lives, right?

1793
01:41:20,116 --> 01:41:21,401
I kind of
like the feeling.

1794
01:41:21,492 --> 01:41:22,572
Yeah, so do I.

1795
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:23,775
I'll see you over there.

1796
01:41:23,869 --> 01:41:24,984
Okay.

1797
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:35,411
Hey, anyone can
figure out life

1798
01:41:35,506 --> 01:41:36,996
when you're
looking back on it.

1799
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:40,504
But we got to live it going forward.
Right, Jakie?

1800
01:41:41,762 --> 01:41:45,254
Besides, four-and-a-half is great in this market.

1801
01:41:45,349 --> 01:41:46,759
Yeah, except I
owe six to the bank.

1802
01:41:46,851 --> 01:41:48,182
When do I have to
be out of here?

1803
01:41:48,269 --> 01:41:50,430
You got three months more.

1804
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:54,105
By the way, I had to
throw in the furniture.

1805
01:41:54,650 --> 01:41:56,481
What there was of it.

1806
01:41:57,820 --> 01:41:59,936
Did you want me to have
a yard sale here for you?

1807
01:42:01,157 --> 01:42:03,113
Here. Take it.
Here's your pen.

1808
01:42:11,751 --> 01:42:12,786
Jake...

1809
01:42:12,877 --> 01:42:14,208
Dolores was just leaving.

1810
01:42:15,046 --> 01:42:16,206
Oh.

1811
01:42:20,217 --> 01:42:24,586
Hello to you, too, honey.
Don't forget. Three months, honey.

1812
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:25,840
Mmm-hmm.

1813
01:42:30,061 --> 01:42:32,052
Bastards changed the locks.

1814
01:42:32,146 --> 01:42:33,477
You weren't
servicing the loans, Ma.

1815
01:42:33,564 --> 01:42:34,644
Well, they lied to me.

1816
01:42:34,732 --> 01:42:36,563
They told me they were
going to give me more time.

1817
01:42:36,651 --> 01:42:38,858
Well, they're not, okay?
They're panicking. Everyone is panicking.

1818
01:42:38,944 --> 01:42:40,150
They're gonna
throw it in the market

1819
01:42:40,237 --> 01:42:41,568
and take what they
can get for it, Ma.

1820
01:42:41,656 --> 01:42:43,817
But it's
not even finished yet.

1821
01:42:43,908 --> 01:42:46,570
And that's not all. Look.

1822
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:48,401
It's the other
properties, Mom.

1823
01:42:48,496 --> 01:42:50,828
No, but they said they were
gonna give me a little more time.

1824
01:42:50,915 --> 01:42:52,496
And all I need
is a 110 grand,

1825
01:42:52,583 --> 01:42:55,700
and then that way,
I can keep all three properties in play.

1826
01:42:55,795 --> 01:42:57,535
I know you have it, Jake.
I don't have it, Mom.

1827
01:42:57,630 --> 01:42:59,086
You have it, Jacob.
I don't have it,

1828
01:42:59,173 --> 01:43:00,754
and I wouldn't give it to you if I did have it.

1829
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:02,505
What am I
supposed to do?

1830
01:43:02,593 --> 01:43:03,924
You know what
moral hazard is, Ma?

1831
01:43:04,011 --> 01:43:05,126
You know what that means?
No.

1832
01:43:05,221 --> 01:43:06,802
It means that once you get bailed out,
what's to stop you

1833
01:43:06,889 --> 01:43:08,095
from taking another shot?

1834
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:09,262
But I...

1835
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:11,386
I'm in trouble, Mom.
I am in trouble right now.

1836
01:43:11,477 --> 01:43:12,683
I'm taking a huge hit
on the loft,

1837
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:13,885
I just sold my bike
for nothing

1838
01:43:13,979 --> 01:43:16,015
and now, again,
I'm writing you a check, Mom. Oh.

1839
01:43:16,107 --> 01:43:17,517
It's ridiculous.

1840
01:43:18,734 --> 01:43:20,941
This is $30,000
that I barely have.

1841
01:43:21,404 --> 01:43:23,190
But that's not enough, honey.
Ma, I love you,

1842
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,487
but I cannot keep hemorrhaging
money for your insanity.

1843
01:43:25,574 --> 01:43:27,235
What you need to do is you
need to go back to Henry.

1844
01:43:27,326 --> 01:43:28,736
You need to get
another job, okay?

1845
01:43:28,828 --> 01:43:32,195
But this is my job. I have a job.
What do you... Oh, my God.

1846
01:43:32,289 --> 01:43:33,654
You mean like
a real job with a boss?

1847
01:43:33,749 --> 01:43:34,829
Yes, a real job.

1848
01:43:34,917 --> 01:43:36,453
I'm too old to get a...
I'm sorry, Ma,

1849
01:43:36,544 --> 01:43:37,624
you got to
start at some point.

1850
01:43:37,712 --> 01:43:39,703
You got to start now.
I can't keep carrying you forever.

1851
01:43:41,132 --> 01:43:44,044
You're not the only one
who's in trouble, Ma. Please.

1852
01:43:44,135 --> 01:43:45,170
Hello?

1853
01:43:45,261 --> 01:43:47,468
DR. MASTERS: Hey, Jake.
We have a problem.

1854
01:43:49,056 --> 01:43:50,091
Go ahead.

1855
01:43:50,182 --> 01:43:53,970
I don't know what happened.
My CFO says the money hasn't arrived yet.

1856
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:57,936
Yeah, but it was
sent yesterday.

1857
01:43:58,023 --> 01:44:00,685
It should have been there before
the Fedwire closed at 6:00.

1858
01:44:01,527 --> 01:44:05,361
Well, maybe there's been some sort of mistake.
It was a large amount.

1859
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:09,482
Okay, just sit tight.

1860
01:44:09,827 --> 01:44:10,987
All right?

1861
01:44:11,162 --> 01:44:12,322
Jesus.

1862
01:44:19,128 --> 01:44:21,835
A few days?
In this city that's nothing.

1863
01:44:22,965 --> 01:44:25,251
Mr. Gekko is good tenant.

1864
01:44:25,843 --> 01:44:27,424
I appreciate it.

1865
01:44:48,115 --> 01:44:52,358
A fisherman always sees
another fisherman from afar.

1866
01:44:58,918 --> 01:45:01,876
Winnie's all I got left.
You understand that?

1867
01:45:04,089 --> 01:45:05,374
How much?

1868
01:45:05,549 --> 01:45:08,006
Close to $100 million
by now.

1869
01:45:10,596 --> 01:45:12,803
Don't go back in there, Jake.

1870
01:45:16,185 --> 01:45:17,846
This is who he is.

1871
01:45:20,564 --> 01:45:22,395
I did tell you, Jake.

1872
01:45:23,818 --> 01:45:25,354
I did warn you.

1873
01:45:26,821 --> 01:45:28,686
I lied to you, Winnie.

1874
01:45:34,578 --> 01:45:38,162
I've been in contact with your
father behind your back.

1875
01:45:42,503 --> 01:45:44,789
After we saw him
at the dinner,

1876
01:45:45,673 --> 01:45:47,880
before you
gave me the money.

1877
01:45:59,562 --> 01:46:00,927
Why?

1878
01:46:03,649 --> 01:46:07,767
Because I thought it was the best thing for you,
you know. For us.

1879
01:46:17,705 --> 01:46:18,945
I just wanted to...

1880
01:46:26,463 --> 01:46:28,044
You're like him.

1881
01:46:30,175 --> 01:46:32,291
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Winnie.

1882
01:46:35,264 --> 01:46:38,301
I'll make it up to you.
I promise I'll get the money back.

1883
01:46:38,475 --> 01:46:42,559
I don't care about the money, Jake!
This is not about the money.

1884
01:46:42,646 --> 01:46:45,433
This is about you and me,
and we are not good anymore.

1885
01:46:48,319 --> 01:46:50,776
Winn, we are good.
Come on.

1886
01:46:52,156 --> 01:46:53,145
We are good.

1887
01:46:53,991 --> 01:46:55,572
Come on, Winn.
We're good.

1888
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:56,694
No.

1889
01:46:59,079 --> 01:47:01,991
We're supposed to make each other feel safe.

1890
01:47:03,959 --> 01:47:06,075
Otherwise,
what's the point?

1891
01:47:12,217 --> 01:47:13,832
It's gone, Jake.

1892
01:47:15,012 --> 01:47:16,968
It's not.
Please don't.

1893
01:47:17,056 --> 01:47:18,512
Take it.

1894
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:26,470
Come on, Winn.

1895
01:47:27,691 --> 01:47:29,022
Please go.

1896
01:47:30,361 --> 01:47:31,521
Please.

1897
01:47:32,696 --> 01:47:33,731
Go.

1898
01:47:40,704 --> 01:47:42,035
I'm sorry.

1899
01:48:15,114 --> 01:48:20,234
China, India, Brazil.
Silver, oil, copper, I want to own it all.

1900
01:48:20,411 --> 01:48:22,948
Buy me Churchill Schwartz,

1901
01:48:23,038 --> 01:48:25,529
and get me updates
on the other financials.

1902
01:48:25,624 --> 01:48:28,411
I'm looking for deals.
Only good deals.

1903
01:48:28,502 --> 01:48:31,915
Just ride the trends.
Just don't try too hard for the turns.

1904
01:48:32,006 --> 01:48:34,122
It's just like
the old days, Bobby.

1905
01:48:34,216 --> 01:48:36,252
What do you feel about
California municipals, Gordon?

1906
01:48:36,343 --> 01:48:38,959
No way.
California has made more mistakes

1907
01:48:39,054 --> 01:48:41,716
than Yogi Berra
reciting Shakespeare.

1908
01:48:42,975 --> 01:48:46,138
Right now,
it is ugly times ugly.

1909
01:48:47,021 --> 01:48:49,512
And that's when
the ugly get going.

1910
01:48:50,607 --> 01:48:54,020
You tell them for me, babe,
Gordon Gekko is back.

1911
01:48:56,864 --> 01:48:58,820
I'm looking for
distressed securities.

1912
01:48:58,907 --> 01:49:00,192
I'm trying to
get a hold of them

1913
01:49:00,284 --> 01:49:02,991
before the government does.
You got that?

1914
01:49:03,704 --> 01:49:04,864
Okay.

1915
01:49:05,539 --> 01:49:06,904
Here you are, Mr. Gekko.

1916
01:49:06,999 --> 01:49:08,159
Nice, Harry.

1917
01:49:08,625 --> 01:49:11,583
Well, then, Alex,
you tell the Treasury Department for me

1918
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:14,912
that I'm willing to stand on
the other side of their auction.

1919
01:49:15,007 --> 01:49:17,544
Not too tight under the arms,
Mr. Gekko?

1920
01:49:17,634 --> 01:49:18,669
Jesus Christ.

1921
01:49:18,761 --> 01:49:20,717
I tell you,
the government's worse than a wife.

1922
01:49:20,804 --> 01:49:23,796
They got all the power,
they got half the money.

1923
01:49:23,891 --> 01:49:26,348
Now they're working
on getting the other half.

1924
01:49:26,685 --> 01:49:28,425
Hey, hey, stay positive, pal.

1925
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:31,307
Most people, they lose,
they whine and quit.

1926
01:49:31,398 --> 01:49:32,808
But you got to
be there for the turns.

1927
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:35,357
Everybody's got good luck,
everybody's got bad luck.

1928
01:49:35,444 --> 01:49:39,028
Don't run when you lose.
Don't whine when it hurts.

1929
01:49:39,114 --> 01:49:41,070
It's like
the first grade, Jerry.

1930
01:49:41,158 --> 01:49:42,898
Nobody likes a crybaby.

1931
01:49:42,993 --> 01:49:44,153
Whooshing sound.

1932
01:49:44,244 --> 01:49:45,825
I'll take four of these.

1933
01:49:59,468 --> 01:50:01,675
Feels good to be
back on top, huh?

1934
01:50:05,724 --> 01:50:08,511
Hey, champ.
What brings you to London?

1935
01:50:08,685 --> 01:50:10,676
You, Gordo.

1936
01:50:12,815 --> 01:50:15,101
You want to make
one last trade?

1937
01:50:15,192 --> 01:50:17,228
Well, that depends.

1938
01:50:18,779 --> 01:50:21,145
Did you ever really want
to reconcile with her?

1939
01:50:23,158 --> 01:50:24,523
I'm human.

1940
01:50:24,618 --> 01:50:25,983
Then why did you do it?

1941
01:50:26,078 --> 01:50:27,943
Well, it's
the same answer.

1942
01:50:28,038 --> 01:50:31,030
Look, I told you before,
Winnie was gonna stake me when I got out.

1943
01:50:31,583 --> 01:50:32,743
You remember,
she reneged.

1944
01:50:32,835 --> 01:50:33,950
Sure, she did.

1945
01:50:34,545 --> 01:50:36,957
It makes you feel better about
stealing from your own blood,

1946
01:50:37,172 --> 01:50:38,457
doesn't it?

1947
01:50:38,549 --> 01:50:40,585
Every thief has some excuse.

1948
01:50:40,926 --> 01:50:43,463
Hey, don't you
act so superior, kid.

1949
01:50:44,555 --> 01:50:49,549
They took 122 thousand hours
of my life for a victimless crime.

1950
01:50:49,726 --> 01:50:52,468
I ate my bitterness
every goddamn day.

1951
01:50:52,563 --> 01:50:54,224
And when I got out,
who was waiting for me?

1952
01:50:54,314 --> 01:50:55,520
Nobody!

1953
01:50:56,441 --> 01:50:58,432
Not even my own daughter.

1954
01:50:59,236 --> 01:51:02,194
I thought Bretton was slime
until I met you.

1955
01:51:03,031 --> 01:51:05,568
I just never believed that a man
would sell out his own daughter.

1956
01:51:05,659 --> 01:51:08,901
You die your way, I'll die mine.
Get the hell out of here.

1957
01:51:08,996 --> 01:51:10,156
You know,
she left me, Gordon.

1958
01:51:10,414 --> 01:51:11,494
Yeah?

1959
01:51:12,916 --> 01:51:15,032
I'm sorry about that.

1960
01:51:15,127 --> 01:51:17,243
Yeah? I bet you are.

1961
01:51:17,921 --> 01:51:19,912
You left it all in ruins.

1962
01:51:21,383 --> 01:51:25,217
But no matter how much money you make,
you'll never be rich.

1963
01:51:25,304 --> 01:51:29,138
See, that's what you never got, kid.
It's not about the money.

1964
01:51:30,225 --> 01:51:33,638
It's about the game.
The game between people.

1965
01:51:34,646 --> 01:51:36,432
And that's all it is.

1966
01:51:38,984 --> 01:51:40,349
Speaking of,

1967
01:51:42,029 --> 01:51:43,815
what's the trade?

1968
01:51:43,989 --> 01:51:48,278
You give back the principal to Winnie.
The $100 million.

1969
01:51:50,454 --> 01:51:52,615
And what do I
get in return?

1970
01:51:55,626 --> 01:51:57,036
Put this in.

1971
01:52:14,645 --> 01:52:16,431
That's your grandson.

1972
01:52:33,997 --> 01:52:37,489
You said,
""The most valuable commodity I know is time.""

1973
01:52:38,669 --> 01:52:40,534
You're looking at time.

1974
01:52:41,255 --> 01:52:42,540
Not money.

1975
01:52:45,509 --> 01:52:47,340
This is time, Gordon.

1976
01:53:00,232 --> 01:53:04,521
I'm sorry, Jake,
but this is simply a trade I cannot make.

1977
01:53:17,582 --> 01:53:19,743
You're a sad man, Gordon.

1978
01:54:34,117 --> 01:54:35,573
You really want to get this site on the map?

1979
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:39,369
You break this story.
It'll take some time, but it'll spread.

1980
01:54:39,456 --> 01:54:42,038
It's the single greatest transfer
of wealth in American history

1981
01:54:42,125 --> 01:54:44,491
from Main Street to Wall Street,
and it's all true.

1982
01:54:44,586 --> 01:54:47,578
And it will happen again because people
like you and me want to be lied to.

1983
01:54:48,256 --> 01:54:50,212
We like bedtime stories.

1984
01:54:53,303 --> 01:54:56,966
I miss you like crazy,
and I love you, baby, and I'm sorry.

1985
01:55:41,351 --> 01:55:46,345
Bretton James, the rumor is that
he was shorting Keller Zabel stock

1986
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:47,976
before he ended
up acquiring it.

1987
01:55:48,233 --> 01:55:50,724
Why would he do that?
This is the rock star of Wall Street.

1988
01:55:50,819 --> 01:55:51,854
Did you hear
about Bretton James?

1989
01:55:52,028 --> 01:55:55,065
CNBC will say he's hedging,
but if you ask me it's a fraud.

1990
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:58,698
It's a tiny website.
Who cares?

1991
01:55:59,077 --> 01:56:02,114
Gekko's daughter and that
smartass kid I fired, Moore.

1992
01:56:02,205 --> 01:56:03,820
What is this about
the rumor that led

1993
01:56:03,915 --> 01:56:05,496
to Louis Zabel
committing suicide?

1994
01:56:05,584 --> 01:56:08,621
Well, shorting his own company,
you can't bust him for that.

1995
01:56:08,712 --> 01:56:10,873
But they can get him for
running false rumors on Zabel,

1996
01:56:10,964 --> 01:56:12,204
that's serious.

1997
01:56:12,299 --> 01:56:14,085
It's gone viral, Bretton.

1998
01:56:14,176 --> 01:56:15,541
Bloomberg has
a summary out on it.

1999
01:56:15,635 --> 01:56:16,966
Reuters is
playing the story big.

2000
01:56:17,053 --> 01:56:20,170
It's become legitimate.
Congress is next.

2001
01:56:21,433 --> 01:56:23,549
This bank is bigger
than you, Bretton.

2002
01:56:24,394 --> 01:56:27,227
We know there's nothing illegal here, Jimmy.

2003
01:56:28,148 --> 01:56:29,228
Jack?

2004
01:56:32,736 --> 01:56:33,896
Julie...

2005
01:56:35,113 --> 01:56:36,944
Are you stupid or what?

2006
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:39,902
Trading for your account
in your position?

2007
01:56:40,494 --> 01:56:43,952
You pigged out, kid.
You were making a fortune here.

2008
01:56:44,206 --> 01:56:46,538
What the hell is
wrong with you?

2009
01:56:47,459 --> 01:56:48,699
Come on.

2010
01:56:50,587 --> 01:56:52,293
So I double-dipped.

2011
01:56:52,631 --> 01:56:53,871
Who hasn't?

2012
01:56:53,965 --> 01:56:57,173
Now, in your time,
you must have done some things.

2013
01:56:57,928 --> 01:56:59,839
You're retiring, Julie.

2014
01:57:00,764 --> 01:57:02,925
Why don't you step up
in front of this?

2015
01:57:03,225 --> 01:57:04,840
You can afford it.

2016
01:57:04,935 --> 01:57:06,675
I can still run this place

2017
01:57:06,770 --> 01:57:10,809
and make you more money
than you ever dreamed.

2018
01:57:13,568 --> 01:57:17,527
We both know that's not going to happen, kid.

2019
01:57:26,498 --> 01:57:27,658
Julie.

2020
01:57:28,375 --> 01:57:30,457
Think about this, please.

2021
01:57:30,544 --> 01:57:32,125
You look for the birds.

2022
01:57:33,630 --> 01:57:36,212
They're going to help you,
those birds. You'll see. Good luck.

2023
01:57:41,263 --> 01:57:45,882
I think I waited too long

2024
01:57:47,227 --> 01:57:52,096
I'm moving into the dollhouse

2025
01:57:52,691 --> 01:57:55,398
Some days we exercise

2026
01:57:55,485 --> 01:57:58,227
Some days we harmonize

2027
01:57:58,321 --> 01:58:03,406
Look away, look away
Look away, oh, yeah

2028
01:58:06,246 --> 01:58:09,204
I don't wanna sound like a rooster
taking credit for the dawn,

2029
01:58:09,291 --> 01:58:13,409
but turning $100 million
into $1. 1 billion

2030
01:58:13,503 --> 01:58:16,290
in this market,
takes some brains, right?

2031
01:58:17,173 --> 01:58:19,289
My guys are good.

2032
01:58:20,385 --> 01:58:23,673
And it's no wonder our new
fund is over-subscribed.

2033
01:58:24,556 --> 01:58:28,219
But for you,
I'm gonna initiate a third fund.

2034
01:58:29,519 --> 01:58:33,387
Because, frankly, Julie,
I couldn't be more excited about this.

2035
01:58:33,481 --> 01:58:36,644
To finally be in business
with you and your firm.

2036
01:58:39,362 --> 01:58:41,853
And us with you, Gekko.

2037
01:58:48,079 --> 01:58:48,989
Yeah.

2038
01:58:51,207 --> 01:58:53,698
What is
the definition of insanity?

2039
01:58:55,086 --> 01:58:57,953
It's doing the same thing
over and over

2040
01:58:58,048 --> 01:58:59,879
and expecting
a different result.

2041
01:59:01,885 --> 01:59:04,922
By that standard,
most of us are insane.

2042
01:59:05,013 --> 01:59:07,004
But not at the same time.

2043
01:59:08,266 --> 01:59:10,382
And on that basis we trust.

2044
01:59:12,145 --> 01:59:13,851
But can this
way of life endure

2045
01:59:13,938 --> 01:59:17,226
if more and more people
are insane at the same time?

2046
01:59:18,902 --> 01:59:22,645
It becomes,
as Gordon said, "Systemic."

2047
01:59:23,281 --> 01:59:24,396
Like cancer.

2048
01:59:27,035 --> 01:59:28,696
What happens then?

2049
01:59:31,039 --> 01:59:32,904
Like I said,

2050
01:59:32,999 --> 01:59:36,366
the mother of all bubbles
was the Cambrian Explosion.

2051
01:59:37,754 --> 01:59:40,666
And it happened by chance
over 500 million years ago.

2052
01:59:40,757 --> 01:59:41,997
Louis Zabel, Bretton?

2053
01:59:42,092 --> 01:59:43,252
Tell us about Louis Zabel.

2054
01:59:44,094 --> 01:59:45,755
Come on. Come on.

2055
01:59:45,845 --> 01:59:46,960
No!

2056
01:59:48,556 --> 01:59:51,673
Scientists will tell you
it was unprecedented,

2057
01:59:51,768 --> 01:59:53,099
it happened in a flash.

2058
01:59:56,106 --> 01:59:57,767
And from it,

2059
01:59:57,857 --> 02:00:01,441
suddenly the world had
millions of new species.

2060
02:00:01,528 --> 02:00:03,735
I'd love a coffee.
So be in, like, 10.

2061
02:00:03,822 --> 02:00:05,528
And from that...
Where are you going?

2062
02:00:05,615 --> 02:00:06,855
...was born us.

2063
02:00:06,950 --> 02:00:07,985
Look at you!

2064
02:00:08,076 --> 02:00:09,065
The human race.

2065
02:00:09,160 --> 02:00:11,947
Mr. Schwartz,
I hear you are leaving us.

2066
02:00:12,122 --> 02:00:14,329
No, that won't be
soon enough.

2067
02:00:14,416 --> 02:00:16,281
Oh. Have you thought about
a timeshare in Florida?

2068
02:00:16,376 --> 02:00:17,912
I could hook you up in Boca.

2069
02:00:19,003 --> 02:00:20,789
Sit down, Mr. James.

2070
02:00:21,548 --> 02:00:25,666
Now, in that sense,
bubbles are evolutionary.

2071
02:00:25,844 --> 02:00:27,926
This is only
a preliminary proceeding.

2072
02:00:28,012 --> 02:00:29,877
But I want you to know
you're under investigation

2073
02:00:29,973 --> 02:00:33,557
on accusations of tax evasion
and stock manipulation

2074
02:00:33,643 --> 02:00:37,556
through, among others,
an entity called Locust Fund.

2075
02:00:37,647 --> 02:00:40,810
Although, I want to first get
to the matter of Louis Zabel.

2076
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:43,141
I see here that you cooperated with this office

2077
02:00:43,236 --> 02:00:46,228
and with the federal
authorities in 1988

2078
02:00:46,322 --> 02:00:49,814
when the investigations
of one Gordon Gekko began.

2079
02:00:49,909 --> 02:00:51,524
They kill excess.

2080
02:00:52,579 --> 02:00:54,490
They lean out the herd.

2081
02:00:55,165 --> 02:00:56,905
But they never die.

2082
02:00:58,001 --> 02:01:00,413
They just come back
in different forms.

2083
02:01:10,096 --> 02:01:12,007
When they burst,

2084
02:01:12,098 --> 02:01:14,305
they give birth to a new day.

2085
02:01:28,990 --> 02:01:30,855
Always creating change.

2086
02:01:51,554 --> 02:01:53,215
Can I carry that?

2087
02:01:58,269 --> 02:02:00,385
You're not sleeping either?

2088
02:02:00,772 --> 02:02:02,763
He woke me up last night.

2089
02:02:06,569 --> 02:02:07,649
Yeah.

2090
02:02:08,404 --> 02:02:09,564
Can I?

2091
02:02:10,698 --> 02:02:11,904
Yeah.

2092
02:02:23,086 --> 02:02:24,246
There?

2093
02:02:24,921 --> 02:02:26,001
Yeah.

2094
02:02:33,555 --> 02:02:35,921
I just got off the phone
with Dr. Masters.

2095
02:02:36,015 --> 02:02:37,425
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

2096
02:02:38,351 --> 02:02:39,887
Very happy man.

2097
02:02:40,562 --> 02:02:42,803
Renewed interests
from investors.

2098
02:02:42,939 --> 02:02:44,770
Because of your story.

2099
02:02:45,358 --> 02:02:46,848
So, thank you.

2100
02:02:51,197 --> 02:02:52,937
I miss you, Winnie.

2101
02:02:54,409 --> 02:02:55,774
I miss you.

2102
02:02:58,746 --> 02:03:00,953
I don't know how to fix this.

2103
02:03:02,709 --> 02:03:04,165
Neither do I.

2104
02:03:06,629 --> 02:03:08,290
It's different now.

2105
02:03:08,381 --> 02:03:09,666
What can I do?
I mean, I...

2106
02:03:09,757 --> 02:03:10,997
Nothing.

2107
02:03:12,969 --> 02:03:14,175
Nothing.

2108
02:03:24,147 --> 02:03:25,262
Thank you.

2109
02:03:26,065 --> 02:03:28,021
Good night.
Good night.

2110
02:03:33,281 --> 02:03:35,237
Where are you two going?

2111
02:03:47,420 --> 02:03:50,503
What, nobody around here
believes in comebacks?

2112
02:03:56,304 --> 02:03:58,340
Winn, I owe you something.

2113
02:03:59,807 --> 02:04:02,514
I don't want it.
I never did.

2114
02:04:03,853 --> 02:04:05,434
No, I figured that.

2115
02:04:05,521 --> 02:04:09,434
But, you know,
when choosing between two evils,

2116
02:04:09,525 --> 02:04:14,360
I like to try the one
that I haven't tried before.

2117
02:04:16,157 --> 02:04:19,991
So I deposited
a check of $100 million

2118
02:04:21,287 --> 02:04:23,869
made out to United Fusion.

2119
02:04:27,210 --> 02:04:30,498
From some offshore fund
no one needs to know about.

2120
02:04:32,048 --> 02:04:35,085
Wouldn't you say green
is the new bubble, Jake?

2121
02:04:44,644 --> 02:04:46,726
You two make a nice couple.

2122
02:04:54,529 --> 02:04:58,067
You know,
Winn, human beings,

2123
02:05:00,576 --> 02:05:02,692
we got to give them a break.

2124
02:05:04,789 --> 02:05:06,575
We're all mixed bags.

2125
02:05:13,673 --> 02:05:14,708
But

2126
02:05:16,592 --> 02:05:18,173
my grandson,

2127
02:05:19,887 --> 02:05:21,218
and you...

2128
02:05:23,474 --> 02:05:26,807
And maybe, you know,
you'll let me be a father again.

2129
02:05:42,910 --> 02:05:48,780
The dimming of the light
makes the picture clearer

2130
02:05:49,208 --> 02:05:52,621
It's just an old photograph

2131
02:05:52,712 --> 02:05:56,705
There's nothing to hide

2132
02:05:56,799 --> 02:06:02,419
And we'll
mix our lives together

2133
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:07,473
Every hand

2134
02:06:07,727 --> 02:06:14,474
Goes searching for its partner

2135
02:06:16,319 --> 02:06:18,981
In crime

2136
02:06:19,072 --> 02:06:21,563
Connecting

2137
02:06:22,325 --> 02:06:26,318
To every living soul

2138
02:06:29,165 --> 02:06:30,905
I'm looking for a home

2139
02:06:32,585 --> 02:06:36,453
Where the wheels are turning

2140
02:06:36,547 --> 02:06:41,792
Home
Why I keep returning

2141
02:06:42,053 --> 02:06:48,470
Home
Will infect what ever you do

2142
02:06:53,356 --> 02:06:58,771
Home
With the neighbors fighting

2143
02:06:58,986 --> 02:07:04,401
Home
Always so exciting

2144
02:07:04,575 --> 02:07:10,662
Home Were my parents telling the truth?

2145
02:07:11,916 --> 02:07:14,157
What's the matter with you guys?
Come on, what's the matter?

2146
02:07:14,252 --> 02:07:16,038
You guys are like the last
two on a ship that is sinking.

2147
02:07:22,385 --> 02:07:23,545
That's pretty.

2148
02:07:23,761 --> 02:07:25,968
Isn't that
a Cracker Jack box ring?

2149
02:07:27,056 --> 02:07:32,517
Home
With our bodies touching

2150
02:07:32,687 --> 02:07:38,307
Home
And the cameras watching

2151
02:07:38,401 --> 02:07:44,488
Home Comes to life from out of the blue

2152
02:08:23,487 --> 02:08:27,230
Home
is where I want to be

2153
02:08:27,325 --> 02:08:30,783
Pick me up and turn me round

2154
02:08:31,454 --> 02:08:35,618
I feel numb
Born with a weak heart

2155
02:08:36,209 --> 02:08:39,576
I guess I must be having fun

2156
02:08:40,296 --> 02:08:43,288
The less we say about it
the better

2157
02:08:44,550 --> 02:08:47,087
Make it up as we go along

2158
02:08:48,679 --> 02:08:52,638
Feet on the ground
Head in the sky

2159
02:08:52,725 --> 02:08:56,058
It's okay
I know nothing's wrong

2160
02:08:56,145 --> 02:08:57,601
Nothing

2161
02:08:57,688 --> 02:09:02,148
Hi, yo
I got plenty of time

2162
02:09:05,988 --> 02:09:10,948
Hi, yo
You got light in your eyes

2163
02:09:13,120 --> 02:09:16,829
And you're standing here
beside me

2164
02:09:18,417 --> 02:09:21,500
I love the passing of time

2165
02:09:22,296 --> 02:09:26,335
Never for money
Always for love

2166
02:09:26,425 --> 02:09:29,542
Cover up and say good night

2167
02:09:29,637 --> 02:09:31,844
Say good night

2168
02:09:59,959 --> 02:10:03,577
Home
is where I want to be

2169
02:10:03,671 --> 02:10:06,788
But I guess I'm already there

2170
02:10:07,591 --> 02:10:11,800
I come home
She lifted up her wings

2171
02:10:12,388 --> 02:10:15,676
Guess that
this must be the place

2172
02:10:16,642 --> 02:10:19,600
I can't tell one from another

2173
02:10:20,980 --> 02:10:23,517
Did I find you
or you find me?

2174
02:10:25,151 --> 02:10:28,518
There was a time
before we were born

2175
02:10:29,238 --> 02:10:32,401
If someone asks
This is where I'll be

2176
02:10:32,491 --> 02:10:33,947
Where I'll be

2177
02:10:34,035 --> 02:10:38,950
Hi, yo
We drift in and out

2178
02:10:42,418 --> 02:10:47,128
Hi, yo
Sing into my mouth

2179
02:10:49,508 --> 02:10:53,592
Out of all
those kinds of people

2180
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:57,296
You got a face with a view

2181
02:10:58,934 --> 02:11:02,768
I'm just an animal
looking for a home

2182
02:11:02,855 --> 02:11:06,097
Share the same space
for a minute or two

2183
02:11:06,275 --> 02:11:10,359
And you love me
till my heart stops

2184
02:11:11,655 --> 02:11:14,112
Love me till I'm dead

2185
02:11:15,618 --> 02:11:19,202
Eyes that light up
Eyes look through you

2186
02:11:19,455 --> 02:11:21,571
Cover up the blank spots

2187
02:11:21,665 --> 02:11:23,701
Hit me on the head

2188
02:11:23,793 --> 02:11:25,124
Ooh

2189
02:11:36,305 --> 02:11:39,889
Home is where I want to be

2190
02:11:39,975 --> 02:11:43,092
Pick me up and turn me round

2191
02:11:44,105 --> 02:11:48,223
I feel numb
Born with a weak heart

2192
02:11:48,317 --> 02:11:51,354
I guess I must be having fun

2193
02:11:53,030 --> 02:11:57,114
The less we say about it
the better

2194
02:11:57,201 --> 02:11:59,533
Make it up as we go along

2195
02:12:01,455 --> 02:12:05,494
Feet on the ground
Head in the sky

2196
02:12:05,584 --> 02:12:08,621
It's okay
I know nothing's wrong

2197
02:12:08,712 --> 02:12:10,248
Nothing

2198
02:12:10,339 --> 02:12:15,254
Hi, yo
I got plenty of time

2199
02:12:18,722 --> 02:12:23,716
Hi, yo
You got light in your eyes

2200
02:12:25,771 --> 02:12:30,686
And you're standing
here beside me

2201
02:12:31,026 --> 02:12:33,859
I love the passing of time

2202
02:12:35,239 --> 02:12:38,731
Never for money
Always for love

2203
02:12:39,201 --> 02:12:42,193
Cover up and say good night

2204
02:12:42,288 --> 02:12:44,279
Say good night.
