00:02:53,477 --> 00:02:54,652
Bet you've never
seen this much land

9
00:02:54,826 --> 00:02:57,612
without people or freeways...

10
00:02:57,786 --> 00:03:00,789
- Or smog.

11
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:14,150
Where are the buildings?

12
00:03:14,324 --> 00:03:15,847
- Tell you what,

13
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:18,981
let's get a
closer look.

14
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:44,659
- Beautiful isn't it?

15
00:03:53,842 --> 00:03:55,800
- How much farther?

16
00:03:55,974 --> 00:03:58,934
- Look ahead.

17
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:05,767
- Are we that to land in that
little lake?

18
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:08,509
- Well we'll give it shot,
I've never done this before,

19
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:11,686
it's my first time.

20
00:04:12,817 --> 00:04:14,341
[LAUGH]

21
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:17,518
I'm just kidding.

22
00:05:16,925 --> 00:05:19,275
- Who's that?

23
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:21,973
- That's Pete.

24
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:24,454
- Who is he?

25
00:05:24,628 --> 00:05:27,588
- Pete's a ranger,
works with me.

26
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:45,345
- Welcome to Heartbreak Bay.

27
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,303
- Yeah.

28
00:05:47,477 --> 00:05:48,609
- I'm Peter.

29
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:52,003
- Hi Pete.

30
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:53,527
- Step on down there.

31
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:55,790
Whoa, buddy.

32
00:05:55,964 --> 00:05:58,749
There's plenty of time for a
swim later.

33
00:05:58,923 --> 00:06:00,708
- Yeah. Thanks.

34
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:04,494
- Uh, I never thought I'd see
the day,

35
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:07,671
your Dad got this bag
from our Dad

36
00:06:07,845 --> 00:06:09,804
the day he took off for college.

37
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:12,415
He called it his lucky bag.

38
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:15,636
- Mom tried to throw it away but
Dad said I should have it.

39
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,508
- Your Dad has always had a way
of getting whatever he wants.

40
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:21,642
Come on.

41
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:34,742
Watch your step.

42
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:43,794
- So Pete where's the town?

43
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:46,928
- It's through the trees.

44
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:52,934
- Through the trees, right.

45
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:02,465
- So what do you think?

46
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,077
- It's, uh,

47
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:08,819
it's rustic.

48
00:07:08,993 --> 00:07:10,125
I like it.

49
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:13,433
- [LAUGH]
Rustic.

50
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:14,608
- Any place to board?

51
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:15,826
- Well you could probably get a

52
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,611
few good runs on Main Street.

53
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:18,916
- Yeah it's got a couple of
hundred potholes

54
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,135
but there's not a lot of traffic

55
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:22,746
so you got that going for you.

56
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,008
Your room is over here.

57
00:07:24,182 --> 00:07:27,142
Check it out.

58
00:07:28,926 --> 00:07:29,840
I don't know a whole lot about
decorating

59
00:07:30,014 --> 00:07:31,320
so my friend Dakota

60
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:34,149
helped me fix it up
a little bit.

61
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:35,716
- Cool.

62
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:36,717
- Okay,

63
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:39,023
get settled in.

64
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:40,111
He likes it.

65
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:43,288
- Cool.

66
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:53,951
- All right now I'm very
well-known around these parts

67
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:57,607
for my gourmet trout.

68
00:07:57,781 --> 00:08:00,741
Dig in.

69
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,746
- Uh, I think I'm going
to be sick.

70
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,877
- What's the matter?

71
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:08,618
- It's looking at me.

72
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:11,142
- Oh come on I just caught this
bad boy, Mark.

73
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:13,014
This is bigger than you and me,

74
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:15,538
this is about man's triumphant
return from the hunt,

75
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:18,846
you gotta eat that.

76
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,674
All right look,
how about you just taste this

77
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:22,066
little bit right
here inside the cheek,

78
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,896
that's the best
part right there.

79
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,509
Just a tad?

80
00:08:29,683 --> 00:08:32,642
All right fine, you know what,

81
00:08:32,816 --> 00:08:33,904
I'll eat it.

82
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:34,905
I'm sure I've got some

83
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:38,126
leftover meatloaf.

84
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,303
I'll make you a sandwich.

85
00:08:43,827 --> 00:08:46,047
- Could have been anything

86
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:47,483
but must have been a
pretty big animal

87
00:08:47,657 --> 00:08:51,008
to carry off a full grown sheep.

88
00:08:51,182 --> 00:08:54,838
I heard a bear has been seen
around the old main road.

89
00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:57,101
- Looks like we got us
a bear problem.

90
00:08:57,275 --> 00:09:00,061
- Jack Wedloe is the
one for that job Fog.

91
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:03,238
- We'll see.

92
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:08,025
Have one of the boys keep an eye
on them sheep.

93
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:11,202
Let's go.

94
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:59,599
- Hey Jack how's your grandma
doing today?

95
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:02,732
- This is Dakota's.

96
00:10:07,432 --> 00:10:10,261
Hey Dakota, this is my nephew
Mark,

97
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:12,655
Mark this is Dakota.

98
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:13,917
- Is that your real name?

99
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:16,006
- That's what they call me.

100
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,008
- Just Dakota, nothing else?

101
00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:19,140
- Well if I told you

102
00:10:19,314 --> 00:10:20,315
then these two busy bodies

103
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:24,188
listening behind me would know.

104
00:10:24,362 --> 00:10:27,931
It's really nice to meet you
Mark.

105
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:30,847
- Hey Dakota how about a slice
of meatloaf?

106
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:33,981
- Why don't you grab a basket?

107
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:39,160
She's pretty nice, huh?

108
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:40,770
- Yeah.

109
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:43,251
Is she your girlfriend?

110
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:44,905
- What'd make you say that?

111
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:49,344
- Well she helped you guys fix
up my room.

112
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:53,043
And she cooks dinner for you
guys sometimes.

113
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:56,177
- Yeah sometimes.

114
00:10:56,351 --> 00:10:59,136
All right look,

115
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:04,054
I'll admit I think
she's pretty cool

116
00:11:04,228 --> 00:11:05,316
but she's not my girlfriend.

117
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,970
- Why not?

118
00:11:07,144 --> 00:11:08,276
You know, I mean, she's pretty

119
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,017
and she seems nice.

120
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:13,977
- Yeah well things aren't that
simple,

121
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:15,675
if you know what I mean.

122
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:17,894
[Fog] To tell you the truth
I was expecting

123
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:19,243
a little better turnout
too, are you boys
doing something outside

124
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:20,897
you're not telling
old Fog huh?

125
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:22,856
All right boys I got a little
problem here

126
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:27,164
and you're just the type of guys
who can help me get rid of it.

127
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:30,080
- That's just fine with me.

128
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:34,824
Make sure those dogs are all
tied up nice and tight.

129
00:11:34,998 --> 00:11:36,696
- You all know the score, right?

130
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,175
Now before you
get crazy out there

131
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:41,091
I want to make
one thing real clear.

132
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:43,093
- Collars is fine okay?

133
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:46,749
- You worry too much.

134
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:49,709
- This is not open season on
anything and everything that
crawls out there,

135
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:52,712
we are looking for one big mean

136
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:56,150
black bear that's
been attacking my sheep.

137
00:11:56,324 --> 00:11:58,892
Now for obvious reasons if
there's any dialogue

138
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:01,721
it is between you and me, you
and me.

139
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:04,941
We don't talk to
our friendly ranger.

140
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:06,856
- All you have
here is junk food.

141
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,423
How do you manage not to starve?

142
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:09,990
- We survive on the charity of
others,

143
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:11,382
like yourself.

144
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:12,557
- Uh huh charity is right.

145
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,733
Has he tried to make you eat

146
00:12:13,907 --> 00:12:15,735
some of his famous trout?

147
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:17,954
- I had the meatloaf.

148
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:19,913
- My trout is awesome.

149
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:24,091
Pete tell them how
good my trout is?

150
00:12:24,265 --> 00:12:28,051
[LAUGHTER]

151
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:29,749
- Ranger, Fog Benson is out here

152
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:32,882
he's talking
about killing bears.

153
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:34,362
He can't, oh here he comes now,

154
00:12:34,536 --> 00:12:36,103
you can't let him do this.

155
00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:39,062
- Wedloe, we have to talk.

156
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:40,194
- Okay.

157
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:41,369
- There's a bear out there

158
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:42,892
he's dragging my sheep off,

159
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:44,024
it's your job to do something
about it.

160
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:45,373
- I'll check into it right away.

161
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:47,244
- If you don't I will.
- Really?

162
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:48,680
- If you boys are going to get
into a shouting match

163
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:52,293
do you think you could take it
outside?

164
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:57,254
- Could you put this on my tab,
please?

165
00:12:57,428 --> 00:13:00,170
Thank you.

166
00:13:00,344 --> 00:13:01,868
If you have business with my
office,

167
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:03,913
I'll be back there shortly.

168
00:13:04,087 --> 00:13:07,047
Mark.

169
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:11,791
- All right I got a bear
problem,

170
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:13,923
I'm willing to pay to make it go
away.

171
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:16,491
- Jack's not going to like you
telling folks that, Fog.

172
00:13:16,665 --> 00:13:19,494
- What the ranger likes or don't
like really isn't much of a
concern to me, Dakota,

173
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:21,017
I got a right to protect my
sheep.

174
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:22,932
They come all the way from
Australia

175
00:13:23,106 --> 00:13:26,153
and they're a heck of a lot more
expensive than a bear hide.

176
00:13:26,327 --> 00:13:30,461
So 500 bucks Zeke, Maynard, get
me that bear.

177
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:33,290
Think about what you boys could
do with 500 bucks, huh?

178
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:35,292
Spread the word.

179
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:40,123
- Uh, excuse me Mr. Fog, uh,

180
00:13:40,297 --> 00:13:42,082
bears are a protected species.

181
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:43,518
You should let the ranger take
care of it.

182
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:45,215
- I don't need some, uh,

183
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:48,915
eco hippy from down South
telling me what to do.

184
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:50,525
- I'm just saying that a hot
temper

185
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:55,182
and a loaded gun are not a great
combination.

186
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:56,357
- Yeah.

187
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:58,185
Stick to your tree hugging.

188
00:13:58,359 --> 00:14:00,404
- It's Jack's job to deal with
animal problems.

189
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:03,146
- And it's my job to protect my
stock.

190
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,498
- Well you don't have to run
roughshod over people in the
process.

191
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:09,849
- Unfortunately there are people
out there like Fog

192
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:13,200
who believe that they can shoot
or trap whatever they want,

193
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:15,637
whenever they want

194
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:19,510
and we're responsible for over
1,000 square miles of prime
wilderness.

195
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:21,425
Pete, he was born here,

196
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:24,211
he knows this land better than
anybody.

197
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:27,475
- Yeah there's 300 humans
scattered throughout,

198
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:29,172
870 elk,

199
00:14:29,346 --> 00:14:30,478
78 moose,

200
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:32,175
maybe 100 wolves,

201
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:33,568
a couple hundred deer,

202
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:35,265
and 52 bears,

203
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:37,050
mostly black and a few
grizzlies.

204
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:38,355
- Where do the bears live?

205
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:42,011
- Everywhere, and anywhere.

206
00:14:42,185 --> 00:14:43,621
The biggest ones are
in Grizzly Valley.

207
00:14:43,795 --> 00:14:45,362
- Why do they call it that?

208
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:49,366
- Oh, that's a natural bear
habitat

209
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,021
and it's uninhabited by humans

210
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:53,849
except for poachers.

211
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:55,546
- Poachers?

212
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,114
- Yeah I suspect we got a couple
running around.

213
00:14:58,288 --> 00:15:00,073
Too young bears are missing.

214
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:01,291
- How do you know they're
missing?

215
00:15:01,465 --> 00:15:03,859
- They had radio collars,

216
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:05,817
we lost the signal.

217
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:09,473
Uh, I'd like to believe they
just moved out of the territory.

218
00:15:09,647 --> 00:15:12,607
- You see, Mark,
this is still some very wild
country.

219
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:16,611
So if you go hiking or exploring
the trails you have to be very,
very careful.

220
00:15:16,785 --> 00:15:19,657
You need to respect the land and
the animals that live on it.

221
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:24,184
Because even though they may not
mean to, it could hurt you.

222
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:26,055
Get it?
- Got it.

223
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:27,187
- Good.

224
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:30,364
Give me back my hat.

225
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:46,554
- Come on guys,
let's have some fun.

226
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:55,389
Hey kid, let me use your board.

227
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:04,615
What are you deaf or something,

228
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:07,140
I said give me your
board and your helmet.

229
00:16:07,314 --> 00:16:10,273
Now.

230
00:16:14,756 --> 00:16:16,366
- Leave him alone, Gunther.

231
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,500
- What's it to you, Benson?

232
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,248
- Get lost.

233
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:31,686
- Come on guys, let's get out of
here.

234
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,819
He even needs a girl
to protect him.

235
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:43,176
- Hi, I'm Ashley Benson.

236
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,351
You must be Mark.

237
00:16:44,525 --> 00:16:45,787
- How do you know?

238
00:16:45,961 --> 00:16:46,614
- Dakota has been
talking about you

239
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:48,137
for weeks now.

240
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:49,660
I couldn't wait for you
to get here

241
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:51,140
so she'd talk
about something else.

242
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:52,141
- Why would she
be talking about me?

243
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:53,534
- She's only, like,

244
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,144
completely in love
with your uncle.

245
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:57,277
- I saw the way she looked at my
Uncle Jack.

246
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,807
- Watch out.

247
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:09,637
- It's just Harvey.

248
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:11,639
He's tamer than a lap cat.

249
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:15,382
Shoo Harvey, get, shoo.

250
00:17:15,556 --> 00:17:18,515
- Right.

251
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:27,350
- Jack?

252
00:17:27,524 --> 00:17:30,701
You got an important phone call.

253
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,835
It's the State Department.

254
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:45,020
[Ashley] Do you like living in
Los Angeles?

255
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:46,935
- It's okay.

256
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:51,113
- Come on Los Angeles has got to
be a lot better than okay.

257
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:54,247
-[Fog] Ashley June.

258
00:17:56,553 --> 00:17:58,033
You finished with your chores?

259
00:17:58,207 --> 00:17:59,774
- I borrowed a book from Dakota.

260
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:02,168
- Are you done with your chores?

261
00:18:02,342 --> 00:18:03,821
- No sir.

262
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:06,346
- You're Jack Wedloe's nephew
aren't you?

263
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,609
- Yes sir.

264
00:18:08,783 --> 00:18:09,697
- Get in the car Ashley June,

265
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:11,046
you can play afterward.

266
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,221
- But Dad.

267
00:18:12,395 --> 00:18:14,876
- No butts, get in the car.

268
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:22,231
- Sorry Mark.

269
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:25,365
- Welcome to town, son.

270
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:35,505
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on
there.

271
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,204
It's best to stay away from
other people dogs, okay.

272
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:41,294
They're real protective
of our stuff.

273
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:52,653
- Hey Mark.

274
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:54,742
- Hi.

275
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,613
Who are those two
guys with the dogs?

276
00:18:56,787 --> 00:19:00,139
- Oh they're just some
conservationists doing studies.

277
00:19:00,313 --> 00:19:01,314
You here to see me?

278
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:02,750
- Actually I was going to have a

279
00:19:02,924 --> 00:19:05,144
milkshake with your friend
Ashley

280
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:06,841
but her Dad didn't seem to like
the idea.

281
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:08,277
- Well I guess you're
going to have to settle

282
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:09,583
on having that
milkshake with me.

283
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:12,760
- Cool.

284
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:19,810
So, um, when are you and my
uncle going to hook up?

285
00:19:19,984 --> 00:19:21,682
- What?
- Well it's not like the whole

286
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:23,292
town doesn't know that

287
00:19:23,466 --> 00:19:25,686
you and he totally like
each other.

288
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,687
And Ashley said...

289
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:28,297
- Ashley

290
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:30,169
should know better than
to spread gossip.

291
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:32,780
And you have an ice cream
mustache and should go wash up.

292
00:19:46,402 --> 00:19:48,187
- Jack?

293
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:50,885
- I just got a call from the
State Department,

294
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:54,802
Mark's parents are missing in
Indonesia,

295
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:57,544
they never came back from a
visit to the Rain Forest.

296
00:19:57,718 --> 00:20:00,199
- Oh Jack.

297
00:20:00,373 --> 00:20:03,332
- Whew.

298
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,726
- Hey.

299
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,903
What's up?

300
00:20:43,503 --> 00:20:44,547
- Hi.

301
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:48,812
- Hi.

302
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:53,208
- I, uh, made Mark a hamburger
and some chicken fingers.

303
00:20:53,382 --> 00:20:56,255
I thought you two may be hungry.

304
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:57,908
- Thanks.

305
00:20:58,082 --> 00:21:01,477
- How's Mark doing?

306
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:04,872
- Well, as soon as we got home

307
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:07,396
he locked himself in his room,

308
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:11,531
hasn't come out since.

309
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:13,794
- Is this a picture of you and
Mark's Dad?

310
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:15,317
- Yeah,

311
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:16,579
10 years ago.

312
00:21:16,753 --> 00:21:19,887
- [LAUGH]

313
00:21:20,061 --> 00:21:21,976
You want to talk about it?

314
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,413
- It's weird,

315
00:21:24,587 --> 00:21:28,504
Ben was always the
perfect one.

316
00:21:28,678 --> 00:21:32,595
High school valedictorian, now a
famous doctor.

317
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:35,294
I wish this hadn't happened to
him.

318
00:21:35,468 --> 00:21:37,470
What happens to Mark?

319
00:21:37,644 --> 00:21:41,430
Grandma May is 85 years old, she
can't handle a kid.

320
00:21:41,604 --> 00:21:43,606
He's got nowhere else to go.

321
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,304
I mean, it's one thing to be a
cool uncle

322
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:49,395
for a couple weeks but a
full-time Dad.

323
00:21:53,442 --> 00:21:55,270
I got to be honest, Dakota,

324
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:57,490
I don't know if I'm

325
00:21:57,664 --> 00:22:01,407
ready to be a father,

326
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:02,756
probably screw it up.

327
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,933
- No.

328
00:22:32,176 --> 00:22:35,136
- You know, I once made one skip
15 times.

329
00:22:45,102 --> 00:22:47,627
You know, my people believe
that, uh,

330
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:50,499
all animals have spirits and
souls

331
00:22:50,673 --> 00:22:52,066
and talk to us

332
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,895
in ways we
sometimes don't understand.

333
00:22:58,681 --> 00:23:01,467
She's leading you.

334
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:04,644
Go ahead, follow.

335
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:08,751
- Go on.

336
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:16,803
Go on

337
00:24:16,977 --> 00:24:19,936
follow her.

338
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:52,839
- You like animals boy?

339
00:24:59,193 --> 00:25:01,674
- Sure.

340
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:04,590
- Me too.

341
00:25:04,764 --> 00:25:06,156
That's Harvey there.

342
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,550
- We've met already.

343
00:25:08,724 --> 00:25:12,641
- And this is Andy.

344
00:25:12,815 --> 00:25:14,034
That's Arnold

345
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:17,559
and over there is Max.

346
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:19,082
- You got names for all of them?

347
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:20,954
- Well they all have their own
names,

348
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:22,825
except I don't even know what
they call themselves,

349
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:26,133
so I just give them
names that I know.

350
00:25:26,307 --> 00:25:27,526
What do they call you?

351
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,571
- Mark Wedloe.

352
00:25:29,745 --> 00:25:31,573
- Mark Wedloe.

353
00:25:31,747 --> 00:25:33,270
Name's Cully.

354
00:25:33,444 --> 00:25:36,099
Want to help me feed these guys
Mark Wedloe?

355
00:25:36,273 --> 00:25:37,492
- I should go.

356
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:38,711
Come on.

357
00:25:38,885 --> 00:25:41,844
It'll only take 10 minutes.

358
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,677
See as long as
animals have food,

359
00:25:48,851 --> 00:25:51,680
they don't fight.

360
00:25:51,854 --> 00:25:53,552
It's not like humans.

361
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:55,031
- What about bears?

362
00:25:55,205 --> 00:25:56,555
- Well bears are different,

363
00:25:56,729 --> 00:25:59,775
bears are kind of a solitary
animal.

364
00:25:59,949 --> 00:26:02,517
They spend most of their lives
by themselves.

365
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:05,172
They don't learn to trust much,

366
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:07,087
especially people.

367
00:26:07,261 --> 00:26:09,176
- Why should they when there's

368
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:12,658
poachers and people like Fog
hunting them?

369
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:15,835
- You catch on quick, Wedloe.

370
00:26:18,228 --> 00:26:20,317
Yeah I had me a bear once,

371
00:26:20,491 --> 00:26:24,583
big black beautiful bear.

372
00:26:24,757 --> 00:26:25,975
Got him when he was a cub,

373
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:28,282
that's why we got along so well.

374
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:31,720
- What happened to him?

375
00:26:31,894 --> 00:26:33,940
- Well the folks in town,

376
00:26:34,114 --> 00:26:36,072
they got kind of nervous

377
00:26:36,246 --> 00:26:39,859
forcing me to make a decision.

378
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:41,904
I took him put to a place that,
uh,

379
00:26:42,078 --> 00:26:45,168
well no one from around here
goes there much.

380
00:26:45,342 --> 00:26:48,563
A special little place called
Three Sisters.

381
00:26:48,737 --> 00:26:50,870
Three peaks that look alike,

382
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:53,960
it's called Grizzly Valley.

383
00:26:54,134 --> 00:26:55,788
- What happened to him?

384
00:26:55,962 --> 00:26:57,616
- Well I kind of like to think
that

385
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,749
he's still alive chewing on some
berries

386
00:27:00,923 --> 00:27:01,968
and maybe some fish,

387
00:27:02,142 --> 00:27:05,101
making himself fat for winter.

388
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:11,281
Well, I guess we're just about
done here,

389
00:27:11,455 --> 00:27:13,196
I guess you got to go?

390
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:17,200
- Yeah sure.

391
00:27:17,374 --> 00:27:19,986
- Mark Wedloe,

392
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,119
you come back here
any time you want.

393
00:27:25,252 --> 00:27:28,255
Family we got to see.

394
00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:34,653
- We took the rest of them up to
higher pasture.

395
00:27:34,827 --> 00:27:35,828
- You find anything?

396
00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:37,394
- There's nothing.

397
00:27:37,568 --> 00:27:38,526
- You guys stomped all over any
tracks

398
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,006
that might have been left here.

399
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,051
You can't be
sure of anything now.

400
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:45,141
- You know, bears seldom come
this close to livestock.

401
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:04,770
- Hey. I thought I could go
hiking.

402
00:28:04,944 --> 00:28:07,860
- I'm staying by the phone in
case they call about my folks.

403
00:28:08,034 --> 00:28:10,732
- Sitting here worrying isn't
going to do you any good.

404
00:28:10,906 --> 00:28:13,213
Come on keep me company.

405
00:28:13,387 --> 00:28:15,781
You never can tell when I might
need to be rescued

406
00:28:15,955 --> 00:28:18,784
from some fearsome wolf dog.

407
00:28:38,978 --> 00:28:41,720
- We can stay on this trail
until Wolverine Ridge,

408
00:28:41,894 --> 00:28:44,810
from there we can see
the whole valley.

409
00:28:50,424 --> 00:28:53,383
- You know, uh . . .
- Break.

410
00:28:56,038 --> 00:28:59,912
So, have you always
lived in the city?

411
00:29:00,086 --> 00:29:01,348
- Yeah.

412
00:29:01,522 --> 00:29:02,871
- Do you like it?

413
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:04,655
- Yeah.

414
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,266
- Dakota tells me that your
parents are doctors

415
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,094
that fly around the world and
help people.

416
00:29:08,268 --> 00:29:09,095
- They're part of a group
called, uh,

417
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:11,010
Doctors Without Borders.

418
00:29:11,184 --> 00:29:13,186
Every year they go to some
remote area and help people.

419
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,101
- Wow,

420
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:17,843
they must be very special
people to do that for others.

421
00:29:18,495 --> 00:29:21,455
- Yeah, they are.

422
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:27,287
When we going back?

423
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:31,378
- Hey, want to go see a real
gold mine?

424
00:29:31,552 --> 00:29:34,163
We're not suppose to go but I've
been there once.

425
00:29:34,337 --> 00:29:35,251
- Where is it?

426
00:29:35,425 --> 00:29:38,385
- Over this way, come on.

427
00:29:48,438 --> 00:29:49,918
- Let's go into the mine.

428
00:29:50,092 --> 00:29:52,312
- No way, it's too dangerous.

429
00:29:52,486 --> 00:29:54,270
All these old mines are ready to
collapse.

430
00:29:54,444 --> 00:29:57,099
- Come one maybe there's still
some gold.

431
00:29:57,273 --> 00:29:58,405
- I think not.

432
00:29:58,579 --> 00:29:59,885
[growl]

433
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:01,103
- What was that?

434
00:30:01,277 --> 00:30:02,975
- Uh, wind?

435
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:05,412
[growl]

436
00:30:05,586 --> 00:30:10,112
- That was not the wind.

437
00:30:10,286 --> 00:30:13,246
- Mark.

438
00:30:17,076 --> 00:30:17,946
What is it?

439
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,950
[growl]

440
00:30:22,124 --> 00:30:24,126
- You got to come see this,

441
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,301
it's way cool.

442
00:30:25,475 --> 00:30:29,001
[growl]

443
00:30:29,175 --> 00:30:32,047
- Oh my god!

444
00:30:32,221 --> 00:30:34,963
It's a bear.

445
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:36,312
- He's trapped.

446
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:40,403
- It's an old mine dig Mark.

447
00:30:40,577 --> 00:30:41,927
Come on we need to go back to
town right now

448
00:30:42,101 --> 00:30:42,971
and tell your uncle.

449
00:30:43,145 --> 00:30:46,235
- Yeah, right.

450
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:47,976
And your Dad will come out and
shoot him.

451
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:51,110
- What else can we do?

452
00:30:53,155 --> 00:30:54,896
What are you doing?

453
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:58,030
- He's hungry.

454
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:17,484
- Well, at least he won't be
hungry.

455
00:31:20,182 --> 00:31:22,054
We ought to get back,

456
00:31:22,228 --> 00:31:25,492
there's a storm front coming in.

457
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:26,493
- What about him?

458
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:27,537
- He's a bear, Mark,

459
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:30,671
he'll find a way out.

460
00:31:35,067 --> 00:31:39,419
Mark, come on.

461
00:31:39,593 --> 00:31:42,552
- Sorry buddy.

462
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:58,003
[growl]

463
00:33:52,813 --> 00:33:55,381
What do bears eat?

464
00:33:55,555 --> 00:33:58,079
- What?

465
00:33:58,253 --> 00:33:59,733
- Bears,

466
00:33:59,907 --> 00:34:03,302
what do they eat?

467
00:34:03,476 --> 00:34:06,957
- Uh, pretty much everything.

468
00:34:07,132 --> 00:34:09,134
Berries, insects,

469
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:10,178
bugs,

470
00:34:10,352 --> 00:34:12,006
fish,

471
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:15,227
honey if they can
get it.

472
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:17,272
I guess they'd probably eat
spaghetti.

473
00:34:17,446 --> 00:34:22,190
Pretty much anything, they're
like garbage disposals.

474
00:34:22,364 --> 00:34:24,671
Why this sudden interest in
bears?

475
00:34:24,845 --> 00:34:27,848
- Just interested.

476
00:34:29,676 --> 00:34:33,419
Uh,

477
00:34:33,593 --> 00:34:35,682
do you like my Dad?

478
00:34:35,856 --> 00:34:38,598
- He's my brother.

479
00:34:38,772 --> 00:34:41,166
- You don't see each other much.

480
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,256
- Well I guess we don't have
that much in common.

481
00:34:46,823 --> 00:34:49,696
- Wedloe.

482
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:52,655
What are you
doing about that bear?

483
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:54,527
- I'm eating, Fog.
- And I'm a taxpayer,

484
00:34:54,701 --> 00:34:56,137
my taxes are paying
for that meal.

485
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:57,399
- Fog...

486
00:34:57,573 --> 00:34:58,444
- I lost another
sheep last night

487
00:34:58,618 --> 00:35:00,837
up in my high pasture.

488
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:02,578
- All right well in the
morning, Pete and I, we'll go
check it out.

489
00:35:02,752 --> 00:35:04,276
And keep your men out of the
area this time,

490
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:05,929
they stomp all over
the good tracks.

491
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,409
- There is a bear out there
after my sheep,

492
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:08,671
if you don't do
something about it,

493
00:35:08,845 --> 00:35:10,238
I will,

494
00:35:10,412 --> 00:35:11,674
even if I have to go
in the preserve

495
00:35:11,848 --> 00:35:13,502
to get the job done.
Are we clear?

496
00:35:13,676 --> 00:35:16,636
- That's not a very good idea,
Fog.

497
00:35:29,431 --> 00:35:32,391
Let's get some air, come on.

498
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:42,488
Smell how fresh that air is?

499
00:35:42,662 --> 00:35:44,185
It's pretty amazing huh?

500
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:48,189
- Yeah.

501
00:35:48,363 --> 00:35:50,235
- Mark,

502
00:35:50,409 --> 00:35:53,281
your Dad is a

503
00:35:53,455 --> 00:35:56,806
tough man to live up to.

504
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:00,114
Everything is always a
competition with him.

505
00:36:00,288 --> 00:36:03,117
He always has to win.

506
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:07,643
I'm not built that way.

507
00:36:07,817 --> 00:36:09,819
I, I like it here,

508
00:36:09,993 --> 00:36:11,430
you know, things are

509
00:36:11,604 --> 00:36:12,431
simple,

510
00:36:12,605 --> 00:36:14,520
clear.

511
00:36:14,694 --> 00:36:18,132
This whole situation is,

512
00:36:18,306 --> 00:36:21,527
it's just very difficult.

513
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:24,312
- Don't worry about it.

514
00:36:24,486 --> 00:36:26,706
I can just go and live with
Grandma May.

515
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,490
- No Mark...

516
00:36:28,664 --> 00:36:30,318
- You know, it's okay.

517
00:36:30,492 --> 00:36:31,928
You don't have to tell me you
don't want me here.

518
00:36:32,102 --> 00:36:34,496
- That's not what I'm saying.

519
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,498
It's just

520
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:38,500
so new

521
00:36:38,674 --> 00:36:41,286
to me, this whole thing.

522
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,506
I, I'm, I'm probably going to
mess up now and again,

523
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,380
I just don't want you to think
that it's your fault.

524
00:36:48,554 --> 00:36:50,512
- Yeah.

525
00:36:50,686 --> 00:36:54,647
Mom and Dad used to say that if
we fought before they left,

526
00:36:56,736 --> 00:36:59,695
just this time they might not be
coming back.

527
00:37:12,404 --> 00:37:14,884
[Ben - growling and groaning]

528
00:37:15,058 --> 00:37:18,018
- Uncle Jack's not the
best cook but

529
00:37:21,021 --> 00:37:24,024
here you go.

530
00:37:25,721 --> 00:37:28,681
Do you say thank you?

531
00:37:30,073 --> 00:37:32,946
Sounded like you did.

532
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,340
I don't believe it
but I think I
can understand you.

533
00:37:35,514 --> 00:37:37,907
[Ben groans]

534
00:37:38,081 --> 00:37:41,041
Well, you're welcome.

535
00:37:46,568 --> 00:37:49,528
Book says you got to drink so.

536
00:38:06,545 --> 00:38:09,548
There you go.

537
00:38:16,163 --> 00:38:20,080
I know what it's like being
stuck in a place you don't want
to be.

538
00:38:21,647 --> 00:38:26,434
I'll get you out, I promise.

539
00:38:26,608 --> 00:38:29,437
I said I promise

540
00:38:29,611 --> 00:38:31,352
and I will.

541
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:34,486
I'll see you tomorrow.

542
00:38:48,848 --> 00:38:50,632
- Mr. Wedloe?

543
00:38:50,806 --> 00:38:54,375
- Hi Ashley come on in.

544
00:38:54,549 --> 00:38:55,811
- Is Mark here?

545
00:38:55,985 --> 00:38:58,423
- No, no,
I thought he was with you.

546
00:38:58,597 --> 00:39:00,947
- Well I haven't seen him for a
couple of days now.

547
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:02,340
- Really?

548
00:39:02,514 --> 00:39:03,515
- If you see him,

549
00:39:03,689 --> 00:39:05,908
tell him I'm still alive.

550
00:39:06,082 --> 00:39:09,129
- Okay.

551
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:18,965
[growls]

552
00:39:20,749 --> 00:39:23,970
- I can't figure out how to
get you out without telling
my uncle.

553
00:39:24,144 --> 00:39:25,537
But if I tell my uncle,

554
00:39:25,711 --> 00:39:27,582
Fog Benson might find out

555
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:30,324
and you really don't
want to meet him.

556
00:39:30,498 --> 00:39:33,849
He's not a big fan of bears.

557
00:39:34,023 --> 00:39:36,939
You know, if I wasn't sure,

558
00:39:37,113 --> 00:39:41,074
I'd say you and I do understand
each other, bear.

559
00:39:43,555 --> 00:39:46,514
You do want out, right?

560
00:39:50,692 --> 00:39:53,652
I don't know how.

561
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:03,836
I'll be right back.

562
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:23,769
Stay on one side, bear.

563
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:08,596
- Go on, climb up.

564
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:11,512
Uncle Jack gave me a book about
bears and it says you can.

565
00:41:11,686 --> 00:41:13,035
It's like a tree.

566
00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:15,908
The book says bears can climb
trees.

567
00:41:21,696 --> 00:41:23,568
All right,

568
00:41:23,742 --> 00:41:26,745
it's like this.

569
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,638
- Dee, knock it off.

570
00:41:50,812 --> 00:41:53,075
- Morning fellahs.

571
00:41:53,249 --> 00:41:54,468
- Hey ranger.

572
00:41:54,642 --> 00:41:55,948
- Hey you guys happen to see my,

573
00:41:56,122 --> 00:41:57,732
uh, my nephew exploring the
trails

574
00:41:57,906 --> 00:41:58,864
in the mountains or anything
like that, have you?

575
00:41:59,038 --> 00:42:01,997
- Nope.

576
00:42:02,171 --> 00:42:04,130
- Put your hand down.

577
00:42:04,304 --> 00:42:06,132
- He's doing my caricature.

578
00:42:06,306 --> 00:42:08,961
- Oh, how's your study going?

579
00:42:09,135 --> 00:42:11,572
- Good, probably be done in a
few weeks.

580
00:42:11,746 --> 00:42:14,706
- Ah thanks guys, appreciate it.

581
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,973
[growls]

582
00:42:28,154 --> 00:42:31,157
- Easy bear.

583
00:43:12,851 --> 00:43:16,245
- Cully says bears can be as
gentle as a lamb.

584
00:43:16,419 --> 00:43:19,161
Are you that way?

585
00:43:19,335 --> 00:43:23,296
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make
you mad.

586
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,868
You're out of the hole,

587
00:43:30,042 --> 00:43:33,045
so go home.

588
00:43:39,094 --> 00:43:42,707
It's better if you stay away
from this place

589
00:43:42,881 --> 00:43:45,797
so you don't get stuck
in a hole again.

590
00:44:01,377 --> 00:44:02,944
- Say why don't you and your
brother

591
00:44:03,118 --> 00:44:04,163
take a look at the trails up
around your place?

592
00:44:04,337 --> 00:44:05,381
Pete take a couple of men,

593
00:44:05,555 --> 00:44:07,557
do a wide circle around town.

594
00:44:07,732 --> 00:44:09,298
- Ashley took Mark up to the old
mine,

595
00:44:09,472 --> 00:44:11,997
he wanted to go inside.

596
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:15,087
- Yeah maybe he went down around
the lake area.

597
00:44:18,177 --> 00:44:21,136
- Jack, look.

598
00:44:26,141 --> 00:44:27,316
- Hi.

599
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:29,318
- Where you been?

600
00:44:29,492 --> 00:44:32,321
- I got lost up there, I'm
sorry.

601
00:44:32,495 --> 00:44:36,978
- We started a search party for
you, Mark.

602
00:44:37,152 --> 00:44:38,806
Uh, I'm sorry you guys.

603
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,155
Thank you guys for coming out,

604
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:43,289
I'm sorry about that.

605
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,989
- I needed to go for a walk.

606
00:44:48,163 --> 00:44:49,991
I needed to think about stuff.

607
00:44:50,165 --> 00:44:51,689
- I told you before,

608
00:44:51,863 --> 00:44:53,821
this is not a
city park out here.

609
00:44:53,995 --> 00:44:55,388
You get lost out here,

610
00:44:55,562 --> 00:44:57,172
you get yourself into some
serious trouble,

611
00:44:57,346 --> 00:44:58,173
do you understand that?

612
00:44:58,347 --> 00:45:00,132
- I'm sorry, okay?

613
00:45:00,306 --> 00:45:04,049
- You know what,
go to your room.

614
00:45:04,223 --> 00:45:07,182
Go.

615
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:11,970
- Mark.
- Hey, hey, hey, let him go.

616
00:45:19,368 --> 00:45:23,329
- Well that takes care of that.

617
00:45:23,503 --> 00:45:25,113
- He could have gotten into some
serious trouble, Pete,

618
00:45:25,287 --> 00:45:26,071
and you know it.

619
00:45:26,245 --> 00:45:27,725
- Yeah.

620
00:45:27,899 --> 00:45:31,163
- Besides Social Services is
coming out here,

621
00:45:31,337 --> 00:45:32,991
they're probably just waiting
for me to screw something up

622
00:45:33,165 --> 00:45:34,166
so they can send him back to
California

623
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,821
and stick him in a foster home.

624
00:45:36,995 --> 00:45:39,911
- Are you sure that's not what
you want?

625
00:45:50,573 --> 00:45:53,576
[knock]

626
00:45:57,102 --> 00:45:58,320
- Mark?

627
00:45:58,494 --> 00:45:59,757
Can I come in?

628
00:45:59,931 --> 00:46:03,064
- Yeah it's your place anyways.

629
00:46:03,238 --> 00:46:05,763
- I'd like to talk to
you for a minute.

630
00:46:05,937 --> 00:46:07,025
- I know,

631
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:09,331
I'm a big disappointment right?

632
00:46:09,505 --> 00:46:12,465
- No Mark that's not it.

633
00:46:14,162 --> 00:46:18,993
I just need you to be real
careful out there, okay?

634
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:22,214
- Mom and Dad were careful, it
didn't help them.

635
00:46:22,388 --> 00:46:25,521
- Let's not give up hope on
them.

636
00:46:25,695 --> 00:46:28,829
Tomorrow somebody from Social
Services is coming out

637
00:46:29,003 --> 00:46:31,353
to see if we're getting along.

638
00:46:31,527 --> 00:46:35,009
So maybe we ought to try to get
along,

639
00:46:35,183 --> 00:46:37,446
what do you think?

640
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,971
- I'm going to read now.

641
00:46:40,145 --> 00:46:42,843
- I, I, I'm sorry if I
overreacted,

642
00:46:43,017 --> 00:46:45,977
I was just worried about you.

643
00:47:13,656 --> 00:47:15,049
[Jack] It's been too hard,

644
00:47:15,223 --> 00:47:18,836
we haven't heard anything for
days.

645
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:21,926
Do you have any information
about my brother and his wife?

646
00:47:24,015 --> 00:47:27,148
- Honestly Mr. Wedloe that's not
my department.

647
00:47:27,322 --> 00:47:28,193
I'm just here to check on the
boy.

648
00:47:28,367 --> 00:47:29,194
- Yeah.

649
00:47:29,368 --> 00:47:31,457
- No offense.

650
00:47:31,631 --> 00:47:34,503
- Hey Mark, well this is, uh,

651
00:47:34,677 --> 00:47:36,288
this is Miss, Miss Washborough,

652
00:47:36,462 --> 00:47:37,550
she's from Social Services.

653
00:47:37,724 --> 00:47:40,727
- Hello Mark.

654
00:47:46,298 --> 00:47:48,866
So why don't we all go for a
walk?

655
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,824
- Great, show her the way.

656
00:47:50,998 --> 00:47:55,046
- Um hmm,
yeah good.

657
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:56,351
- Is there a,

658
00:47:56,525 --> 00:47:58,049
a time limit

659
00:47:58,223 --> 00:48:00,355
or some sort of a schedule where
they would,

660
00:48:00,529 --> 00:48:02,357
uh, tell me or determine...

661
00:48:02,531 --> 00:48:04,882
- We'll let you know as soon as,
information I,

662
00:48:05,056 --> 00:48:07,014
they're doing the best they can
that's all I can really say.

663
00:48:07,188 --> 00:48:09,277
Oh God.
- Oh, oh, no, no, no it's okay,

664
00:48:09,451 --> 00:48:13,238
that's just Harvey.

665
00:48:13,412 --> 00:48:15,980
- Shoo Harvey.

666
00:48:16,154 --> 00:48:19,157
Get.

667
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:26,468
It's okay, he's as tame as a lap
cat.

668
00:48:26,642 --> 00:48:30,864
- Honestly, I have strong doubts
about this place.

669
00:48:31,038 --> 00:48:32,300
Wild animals,

670
00:48:32,474 --> 00:48:34,563
wilderness,

671
00:48:34,737 --> 00:48:37,697
do you like being here Mark?

672
00:48:40,047 --> 00:48:44,530
- Uh, um,

673
00:48:44,704 --> 00:48:46,314
I, I, um . . .

674
00:48:46,488 --> 00:48:47,881
- Mark?

675
00:48:48,055 --> 00:48:49,970
- Well

676
00:48:50,144 --> 00:48:52,364
how do you like it here, Mark?

677
00:48:52,538 --> 00:48:53,974
- I got to go meet some friends.

678
00:48:54,148 --> 00:48:56,020
It was nice meeting you Miss
Washborough.

679
00:48:56,194 --> 00:48:58,457
- Mark, Mark.

680
00:48:58,631 --> 00:49:00,024
[LAUGH]

681
00:49:00,198 --> 00:49:02,722
Well at least he's
made some friends.

682
00:49:04,724 --> 00:49:07,335
- What are you doing here?

683
00:49:07,509 --> 00:49:09,990
I told you to go home.

684
00:49:10,164 --> 00:49:12,645
Yes.

685
00:49:12,819 --> 00:49:14,081
If anyone sees you here,

686
00:49:14,255 --> 00:49:17,215
it'll be a big mess.

687
00:49:19,608 --> 00:49:22,568
All right, come on.

688
00:49:25,788 --> 00:49:28,313
[Mrs. Washborough] Mr. Wedloe I
am not entirely impressed

689
00:49:28,487 --> 00:49:29,575
with your discipline skills.

690
00:49:29,749 --> 00:49:30,924
- Miss Washburn . . .

691
00:49:31,098 --> 00:49:32,447
- Washborough.

692
00:49:32,621 --> 00:49:34,928
- Washborough, I apologize.

693
00:49:35,102 --> 00:49:36,625
You seem to be somebody who is

694
00:49:36,799 --> 00:49:37,626
genuinely concerned with Mark's
well-being.

695
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,280
- Um hmm, and?

696
00:49:39,454 --> 00:49:41,282
- I have to be honest with you,
I'm not

697
00:49:41,456 --> 00:49:43,589
so sure that Mark
belongs here myself.

698
00:49:43,763 --> 00:49:48,463
And I don't know if I'm prepared
to be an instant father.

699
00:49:48,637 --> 00:49:50,117
- So you have doubts yourself?

700
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:52,076
- Yes ma'am.

701
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:55,949
- Knowing you have doubts is a
very serious matter to me.

702
00:49:56,123 --> 00:49:58,386
I'm glad you admitted it.

703
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,127
It means you're
thinking it through,

704
00:50:00,301 --> 00:50:02,347
grasping the importance.

705
00:50:02,521 --> 00:50:04,175
Anyone who doesn't feel the
rumble of contemplating

706
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:06,742
all that's stake is a fool.

707
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:09,006
Keep up the good work.

708
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,485
But I will monitor the situation

709
00:50:10,659 --> 00:50:14,141
and expect reports every week.

710
00:50:14,315 --> 00:50:15,795
- Yeah.

711
00:50:15,969 --> 00:50:19,973
- Listen, you got to
get out of this place.

712
00:50:20,147 --> 00:50:23,498
Even my uncle is
looking for you.

713
00:50:23,672 --> 00:50:25,587
And, and you couldn't have
gotten those sheep

714
00:50:25,761 --> 00:50:27,546
because you were stuck in the
hole, right?

715
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,201
[groaning]

716
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:34,553
I can't save you all the time.

717
00:50:34,727 --> 00:50:37,730
I'm planning on leaving this
place anyway.

718
00:50:37,904 --> 00:50:39,993
I hate these woods,

719
00:50:40,167 --> 00:50:43,475
and I hate this place.

720
00:50:43,649 --> 00:50:46,565
I'm all alone.

721
00:50:46,739 --> 00:50:51,309
[groan]

722
00:50:51,483 --> 00:50:54,486
But at least no one's hunting
me.

723
00:51:05,192 --> 00:51:06,672
Can you do that, bear?

724
00:51:06,846 --> 00:51:09,849
[quiet groan]

725
00:51:12,591 --> 00:51:15,681
No, all the way up like the
picture.

726
00:51:15,855 --> 00:51:18,858
[growl]

727
00:51:24,907 --> 00:51:28,215
Can you roll over too?

728
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:31,740
[dogs barking]

729
00:51:31,914 --> 00:51:35,048
Come on, let's go check it out.

730
00:51:35,222 --> 00:51:38,182
[dogs barking rapidly]

731
00:51:57,766 --> 00:52:02,162
- Mr. Wedloe I have a problem.

732
00:52:02,336 --> 00:52:05,296
[dogs barking]

733
00:52:07,472 --> 00:52:10,127
- Can't you shut those dogs up?

734
00:52:10,301 --> 00:52:11,563
- What difference does it make

735
00:52:11,737 --> 00:52:13,434
they'll probably missed
anyway.

736
00:52:13,608 --> 00:52:14,914
- Down bear.

737
00:52:15,088 --> 00:52:17,264
- There, right there.
- Get down.

738
00:52:17,438 --> 00:52:20,702
Thank you.

739
00:52:20,876 --> 00:52:22,269
- Hold those dogs back,

740
00:52:22,443 --> 00:52:24,619
we don't want them tearing into
this fox.

741
00:52:24,793 --> 00:52:26,317
Oh yeah he's just fine,

742
00:52:26,491 --> 00:52:27,840
he's dreaming.

743
00:52:28,014 --> 00:52:29,320
- Likely well and sleeping.
- Yeah.

744
00:52:29,494 --> 00:52:30,582
- That rings the bell for the
buyer,

745
00:52:30,756 --> 00:52:32,192
that's top cash right there,

746
00:52:32,366 --> 00:52:33,585
- That's good.
- Yes siree.

747
00:52:33,759 --> 00:52:35,326
[LAUGH]

748
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,850
- You know something strange
here,

749
00:52:38,024 --> 00:52:40,505
they're not even interested in
the fox.

750
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:43,290
I think there's something else
around here.

751
00:52:43,464 --> 00:52:46,424
Something big!

752
00:52:51,037 --> 00:52:53,996
- Let's get out of here.

753
00:53:01,047 --> 00:53:02,875
- You know,
there's something else here.

754
00:53:03,049 --> 00:53:04,137
There's something.

755
00:53:04,311 --> 00:53:07,271
[dogs growling and barking]

756
00:53:17,368 --> 00:53:20,327
[action music]

757
00:53:25,941 --> 00:53:27,508
- I can lead those guys away,

758
00:53:27,682 --> 00:53:30,642
you're going to have to cross
the water.

759
00:53:31,686 --> 00:53:35,212
I need you to get
your scent on me.

760
00:53:35,386 --> 00:53:37,431
I saw this in a movie once.

761
00:53:37,605 --> 00:53:39,912
The dogs will think I'm you.

762
00:53:40,086 --> 00:53:41,522
- Well he's got
something for us.

763
00:53:41,696 --> 00:53:43,698
Ho ho.

764
00:53:43,872 --> 00:53:46,832
- Go on bear, go.

765
00:53:58,017 --> 00:54:01,020
Go, go.

766
00:54:04,937 --> 00:54:06,243
[Ashley] It's true Mr. Wedloe,

767
00:54:06,417 --> 00:54:08,767
we found the bear in an old mine
hole.

768
00:54:08,941 --> 00:54:11,552
I think Mark's been going back
to feed it.

769
00:54:11,726 --> 00:54:13,685
It couldn't have killed Dad's
sheep.

770
00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:15,861
- Well maybe the bear got out of
the hole.

771
00:54:16,035 --> 00:54:17,341
- Ashley June.

772
00:54:17,515 --> 00:54:18,559
- I told him about the bear,

773
00:54:18,733 --> 00:54:19,691
he's real mad.

774
00:54:19,865 --> 00:54:20,866
- Uh, he's always mad.

775
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,216
Hey Fog.

776
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:25,827
- Ashley.
- Daddy I told you about the
bear so you wouldn't hurt him.

777
00:54:26,001 --> 00:54:28,613
- And I thought I told you to
stay home.

778
00:54:28,787 --> 00:54:31,790
I want you to get on your bike,
I want you to go home now!

779
00:54:31,964 --> 00:54:32,878
- Tell Mark I'm sorry.

780
00:54:33,052 --> 00:54:35,924
- Now!

781
00:54:36,098 --> 00:54:37,361
- Well it looks like your nephew

782
00:54:37,535 --> 00:54:40,886
just saved me a whole lot of
trouble.

783
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:43,541
- Hey Fog,
I'm responsible for the animals
around here.

784
00:54:43,715 --> 00:54:46,761
- Yeah, yeah.

785
00:54:46,935 --> 00:54:48,328
- Something's happened,

786
00:54:48,502 --> 00:54:49,677
I think they lost
the trail or something.

787
00:54:49,851 --> 00:54:51,113
One of them wants
to go this way,

788
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,767
the other one wants
to go the other.

789
00:54:52,941 --> 00:54:54,769
They're confused, come on.

790
00:54:54,943 --> 00:54:56,597
Come on dogs get up.

791
00:54:56,771 --> 00:54:58,773
Up hey we're back down now,

792
00:54:58,947 --> 00:55:00,645
come on let's go.

793
00:55:00,819 --> 00:55:02,647
[dogs barking]

794
00:55:02,821 --> 00:55:05,780
[action music]

795
00:55:42,643 --> 00:55:45,603
- Get on, faster.
Get on.

796
00:55:47,169 --> 00:55:50,129
Don't lose them,
old boy.

797
00:56:01,009 --> 00:56:05,057
- Ray, Ray.

798
00:56:05,231 --> 00:56:07,494
- Well why are we stopping here
Daddy?

799
00:56:07,668 --> 00:56:09,366
- Ray go get your gear

800
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,150
I'm going to pick up
or I'll meet you in 20 minutes.

801
00:56:11,324 --> 00:56:12,064
Because you're going to stay
here until I get back.

802
00:56:12,238 --> 00:56:13,587
- Back from where?

803
00:56:13,761 --> 00:56:15,023
- I got some unfinished
business.

804
00:56:15,197 --> 00:56:16,590
- I shouldn't have said
anything.

805
00:56:16,764 --> 00:56:19,419
- Honey you did the right thing,
now go on.

806
00:56:19,593 --> 00:56:22,030
Dakota said she'll
baby- sit you all right?

807
00:56:22,204 --> 00:56:25,164
Ray, get the lead out, go.

808
00:56:37,698 --> 00:56:40,658
- Baby-sitter?

809
00:56:43,791 --> 00:56:46,751
- Now what are you doing here,
hmm?

810
00:56:59,546 --> 00:57:01,896
- Mark?

811
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:03,768
Where you been?

812
00:57:03,942 --> 00:57:05,465
- Nowhere.

813
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:08,555
- Ashley told me about the bear.

814
00:57:08,729 --> 00:57:10,731
- What bear?

815
00:57:10,905 --> 00:57:12,080
- Apparently the kids found a
bear

816
00:57:12,254 --> 00:57:14,082
trapped in the old mine.

817
00:57:14,256 --> 00:57:15,693
- Uh, the old mine,

818
00:57:15,867 --> 00:57:18,130
do you want us to go down there
and, uh...

819
00:57:18,304 --> 00:57:19,914
- No, no that's my job.

820
00:57:20,088 --> 00:57:21,786
I was about to go
do that right now

821
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,615
but I think Mark and I have to
have a little talk first.

822
00:57:24,789 --> 00:57:28,096
Inside.

823
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:31,709
Thanks for finding him guys.

824
00:57:31,883 --> 00:57:34,799
- Uh, uh, it was a good thing we
found him, huh?

825
00:57:36,975 --> 00:57:39,934
A real good thing.

826
00:57:45,723 --> 00:57:47,202
[Mark] You're not listening to
me Uncle Jack,

827
00:57:47,376 --> 00:57:48,726
I think they're poachers.

828
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:51,555
- Mark,
Gittis and Norwood helped him.

829
00:57:51,729 --> 00:57:53,513
- I saw them shoot a fox with a
dart gun.

830
00:57:53,687 --> 00:57:55,820
- That's what they do, Mark.

831
00:57:55,994 --> 00:57:58,039
They tag animals so that we can
study them

832
00:57:58,213 --> 00:58:01,173
and the entire eco system.

833
00:58:01,347 --> 00:58:02,870
Well come on, Mark,

834
00:58:03,044 --> 00:58:05,438
I don't even know what to say to
you anymore.

835
00:58:05,612 --> 00:58:07,092
All right,

836
00:58:07,266 --> 00:58:10,661
so you say that you
and the bear can talk?

837
00:58:10,835 --> 00:58:12,140
- No not really talk,

838
00:58:12,314 --> 00:58:14,099
but we can understand each
other.

839
00:58:14,273 --> 00:58:15,796
- Cully put those ideas in your
head didn't he

840
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:17,711
with all those
bear stories of his?

841
00:58:17,885 --> 00:58:19,713
- No.

842
00:58:19,887 --> 00:58:20,801
- I want to believe you, Mark,

843
00:58:20,975 --> 00:58:23,021
I really do.

844
00:58:23,195 --> 00:58:25,153
But bears are just not friendly
to people,

845
00:58:25,327 --> 00:58:26,938
let alone little boys.

846
00:58:27,112 --> 00:58:30,942
- I am not a little boy.

847
00:58:31,116 --> 00:58:32,421
- I want you to stay here

848
00:58:32,596 --> 00:58:33,422
until I've had a chance to check
this out,

849
00:58:33,597 --> 00:58:34,162
do you understand me?

850
00:58:34,336 --> 00:58:37,296
- Fine.

851
00:58:49,047 --> 00:58:50,788
- Crazy kid,

852
00:58:50,962 --> 00:58:52,485
he could have gotten himself
killed.

853
00:58:52,659 --> 00:58:54,705
People and bears just don't
become friends.

854
00:58:54,879 --> 00:58:56,576
Not out here,
it doesn't happen.

855
00:58:56,750 --> 00:59:00,537
- I admit it sounds like a crazy
story, Jack,

856
00:59:00,711 --> 00:59:02,190
but it has happened.

857
00:59:02,364 --> 00:59:05,193
- Now is not the time for Indian
legends, Pete,

858
00:59:05,367 --> 00:59:06,673
this is ridiculous.

859
00:59:06,847 --> 00:59:09,110
It's dangerous.

860
00:59:09,284 --> 00:59:10,808
Maybe,

861
00:59:10,982 --> 00:59:13,245
maybe he would be better
off in a foster home.

862
00:59:31,089 --> 00:59:33,657
- Where you going?

863
00:59:33,831 --> 00:59:36,094
You're going to
go help the bear.

864
00:59:36,268 --> 00:59:38,139
- You don't understand.

865
00:59:38,313 --> 00:59:40,533
See you.

866
00:59:40,707 --> 00:59:43,667
- Try me?

867
00:59:57,245 --> 00:59:59,683
- How do you even know he's
going to be there?

868
00:59:59,857 --> 01:00:02,860
I think he lives at the mine.

869
01:00:22,401 --> 01:00:24,751
[knocking]

870
01:00:24,925 --> 01:00:27,885
- Mark?

871
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:41,725
- [LAUGH]

872
01:00:41,899 --> 01:00:44,815
Looks like we found us another
bear Norwood.

873
01:00:46,991 --> 01:00:49,950
Shoot.

874
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:52,866
- Kid must of got him out.

875
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,304
- I see that Nor.

876
01:00:56,478 --> 01:00:58,959
- They got a fresh scent.

877
01:00:59,133 --> 01:01:02,180
Go dog, get him dog.
Get him.

878
01:01:02,354 --> 01:01:05,313
Let's go.
Ow.

879
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,103
- Hey.
- Hello.

880
01:01:12,277 --> 01:01:13,844
- Did you happen to see Mark
come by here?

881
01:01:14,018 --> 01:01:16,977
- No, why?

882
01:01:18,849 --> 01:01:20,851
- I guess I
am screwing up,

883
01:01:21,025 --> 01:01:25,290
I think he ran away.

884
01:01:25,464 --> 01:01:26,639
Pete and I are up to the old
mine right now

885
01:01:26,813 --> 01:01:28,336
see if we can find him.

886
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:29,773
If he comes by here,

887
01:01:29,947 --> 01:01:30,817
hang onto him will you?

888
01:01:30,991 --> 01:01:32,253
- Yeah.

889
01:01:32,427 --> 01:01:35,474
- Thanks.

890
01:01:41,175 --> 01:01:44,352
- They beat us.

891
01:01:44,526 --> 01:01:45,745
They're after the bear.

892
01:01:45,919 --> 01:01:46,920
Come on,

893
01:01:47,094 --> 01:01:50,010
we got to get to him first.

894
01:02:04,546 --> 01:02:07,245
- All right I'm not waiting for
the ranger to take care of this,

895
01:02:07,419 --> 01:02:10,204
$500 to the man who brings that
bear down.

896
01:02:10,378 --> 01:02:11,379
We can split up.

897
01:02:11,553 --> 01:02:12,424
I'm going to head northwest.

898
01:02:12,598 --> 01:02:14,165
If you sight the bear

899
01:02:14,339 --> 01:02:15,209
I want you to call me on the
radio.

900
01:02:15,383 --> 01:02:18,343
- Yes sir.
- Go on.

901
01:02:21,041 --> 01:02:24,001
[ominous music]

902
01:02:42,889 --> 01:02:45,849
- There.

903
01:02:49,069 --> 01:02:52,029
- He's ahead of them.

904
01:03:12,353 --> 01:03:16,270
Bear.

905
01:03:16,444 --> 01:03:18,795
Bear we gotta go.

906
01:03:18,969 --> 01:03:20,884
- I don't believe it.

907
01:03:21,058 --> 01:03:24,104
I never saw a wild bear that you
could get this close to.

908
01:03:24,278 --> 01:03:25,366
- He's not any bear,

909
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:28,326
he's my bear.

910
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,242
We gotta go.

911
01:03:31,416 --> 01:03:33,505
- There's a cave right over
there that we can hide in.

912
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:36,334
- Okay but you're going to
have to lead them away.

913
01:03:36,508 --> 01:03:38,118
Rub your clothes on him.

914
01:03:38,292 --> 01:03:39,511
- What?

915
01:03:39,685 --> 01:03:40,686
- You got to get
your scent on him,

916
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,035
the dogs will follow his scent.

917
01:03:42,209 --> 01:03:43,297
It's worked before.

918
01:03:43,471 --> 01:03:44,472
- I, I don't know.

919
01:03:44,646 --> 01:03:45,952
- Ashley just trust me,

920
01:03:46,126 --> 01:03:49,086
I did it.

921
01:03:52,132 --> 01:03:55,135
Come on.

922
01:03:55,309 --> 01:03:58,269
It's okay.

923
01:04:11,238 --> 01:04:14,198
- Come on.

924
01:04:18,767 --> 01:04:21,727
Come on rub his scent
on you, come on.

925
01:04:24,164 --> 01:04:25,513
Good bear.

926
01:04:25,687 --> 01:04:29,126
- What's the matter?

927
01:04:30,518 --> 01:04:33,521
Find him.

928
01:04:37,221 --> 01:04:40,137
- What are we going to
do about the bear's
scent leading in here?

929
01:04:43,357 --> 01:04:45,098
- Insect repellant.

930
01:04:45,272 --> 01:04:47,231
To cover his trail.

931
01:04:47,405 --> 01:04:49,059
- Thanks.

932
01:04:49,233 --> 01:04:52,062
So where you going to take him?

933
01:04:52,236 --> 01:04:55,195
- Where all bears are safe.

934
01:04:58,024 --> 01:05:00,984
- Good luck.

935
01:05:27,488 --> 01:05:28,576
- Go on, boy.

936
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:29,621
Good boy

937
01:05:29,795 --> 01:05:32,798
Stay on it.

938
01:05:37,107 --> 01:05:38,978
- What?

939
01:05:39,152 --> 01:05:40,675
Norwood what?

940
01:05:40,849 --> 01:05:41,546
- I don't know they've lost it
or something,

941
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:42,547
they're confused.

942
01:05:42,721 --> 01:05:45,419
Just be patient.

943
01:05:45,593 --> 01:05:47,247
Oh they, they
found something there.

944
01:05:47,421 --> 01:05:50,381
Come on, let's go,
what are you up for?

945
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:58,563
Come on let's go.

946
01:06:20,106 --> 01:06:23,066
- We're going to Grizzly Valley.

947
01:06:48,439 --> 01:06:51,442
- Gittis and Norwood.

948
01:06:53,487 --> 01:06:56,577
Um, did you ever see a couple of
conservationists

949
01:06:56,751 --> 01:06:59,363
drive a ground ripper like this?

950
01:06:59,537 --> 01:07:02,627
- Nope.

951
01:07:02,801 --> 01:07:04,368
- Whoa, whoa,

952
01:07:04,542 --> 01:07:07,501
isn't that illegal search?

953
01:07:09,068 --> 01:07:12,115
- Just looking for my hat.

954
01:07:24,823 --> 01:07:27,173
- Lot of drugs here for
catch and release.

955
01:07:27,347 --> 01:07:30,089
- They're poachers Jack.

956
01:07:30,263 --> 01:07:33,179
Working for a
private zoo in Europe.

957
01:07:36,574 --> 01:07:39,229
Man.

958
01:07:39,403 --> 01:07:40,230
- Well I guess we know what
happened

959
01:07:40,404 --> 01:07:43,320
to our two missing bears.

960
01:07:55,549 --> 01:07:58,509
[ominous music]

961
01:08:28,408 --> 01:08:31,368
- That's my daughter's jacket.

962
01:08:46,557 --> 01:08:49,429
She's suppose to
be back in town.

963
01:08:49,603 --> 01:08:50,952
- What would she
be doing out here?

964
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,084
- I don't know but it
has something

965
01:08:52,258 --> 01:08:53,085
to do with that Wedloe boy,

966
01:08:53,259 --> 01:08:55,174
I can bet you that.

967
01:08:55,348 --> 01:08:58,090
I want to be the first person
that catches up with them kids.

968
01:08:58,264 --> 01:09:00,092
- Uh, let us find her for you,

969
01:09:00,266 --> 01:09:01,137
we, we can do that.

970
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:02,616
- I'm coming with you.

971
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:04,705
These dogs are going
to come in handy.

972
01:09:04,879 --> 01:09:06,272
- That wouldn't be
a good idea see...

973
01:09:06,446 --> 01:09:08,579
- Hey, hey see
she's my daughter.

974
01:09:08,753 --> 01:09:10,668
We're going to head back
the way you guys came

975
01:09:10,842 --> 01:09:15,542
until the dogs pick
up a fresh trail.

976
01:09:15,716 --> 01:09:17,109
Let's go.

977
01:09:17,283 --> 01:09:20,243
Go.

978
01:09:22,419 --> 01:09:23,420
- Where's Mark?

979
01:09:23,594 --> 01:09:25,596
- We're trying to save the bear.

980
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:27,815
- From Gittis and Norwood,
we know.

981
01:09:27,989 --> 01:09:29,469
- It'll be better for Mark

982
01:09:29,643 --> 01:09:34,213
and the bear if we find him
first.

983
01:09:34,387 --> 01:09:35,736
- All he told me was

984
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:40,132
that he was going
where bears are safe.

985
01:09:40,306 --> 01:09:41,394
- Grizzly Valley.

986
01:09:41,568 --> 01:09:44,528
- Yep.

987
01:10:05,418 --> 01:10:07,725
- I told you to hold onto him
Norwood.

988
01:10:07,899 --> 01:10:09,161
- Well wait,

989
01:10:09,335 --> 01:10:11,555
I'm sure they won't hurt people.

990
01:10:11,729 --> 01:10:14,297
- Now what are you boys really
looking for here?

991
01:10:14,471 --> 01:10:16,342
- Well we're going to help you
find your daughter.

992
01:10:16,516 --> 01:10:17,517
- That ain't the Wedloe boy.

993
01:10:17,691 --> 01:10:18,518
- Well hold it,
hold it,

994
01:10:18,692 --> 01:10:20,390
hold it a minute.

995
01:10:20,564 --> 01:10:22,392
That's all.

996
01:10:22,566 --> 01:10:24,698
- We're going to help you find
your daughter but, uh . . .

997
01:10:24,872 --> 01:10:25,917
- All right give it to me
straight here boys,

998
01:10:26,091 --> 01:10:28,398
what exactly are you after?

999
01:10:28,572 --> 01:10:31,531
- The bear.

1000
01:10:32,532 --> 01:10:34,012
- I'm going with you.

1001
01:10:34,186 --> 01:10:36,232
That way I can show
you where I left him.

1002
01:10:36,406 --> 01:10:37,885
- You already told us where,
I know the spot.

1003
01:10:38,059 --> 01:10:39,713
- Mr. Wedloe please.

1004
01:10:39,887 --> 01:10:41,411
- Ashley you're going to turn
your bike around,

1005
01:10:41,585 --> 01:10:42,847
you're going to peddle straight
to Dakota's

1006
01:10:43,021 --> 01:10:43,935
you understand me?

1007
01:10:44,109 --> 01:10:47,243
- But.
- No buts.

1008
01:10:47,417 --> 01:10:49,201
- Yes sir.

1009
01:10:49,375 --> 01:10:52,335
- Are you ready?

1010
01:10:54,467 --> 01:10:57,383
Well I guess that
means we're leaving.

1011
01:11:01,909 --> 01:11:03,824
- Come here, smell this.

1012
01:11:03,998 --> 01:11:05,696
Good boy.

1013
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:07,393
Good boys.

1014
01:11:07,567 --> 01:11:09,613
See I told you they'd wait.

1015
01:11:09,787 --> 01:11:10,962
All right let's get back on it.

1016
01:11:11,136 --> 01:11:12,224
Get the bear,
get the bear.

1017
01:11:12,398 --> 01:11:15,401
They're on it.
[LAUGH]

1018
01:11:15,575 --> 01:11:16,881
[groans]

1019
01:11:17,055 --> 01:11:20,058
- I know, I know I'm hungry too.

1020
01:11:39,599 --> 01:11:42,559
It's the last one.

1021
01:11:50,958 --> 01:11:53,961
Here.

1022
01:11:58,705 --> 01:12:01,882
You like it?

1023
01:12:02,056 --> 01:12:05,016
[dogs barking]

1024
01:12:07,671 --> 01:12:10,674
Come on we gotta go.

1025
01:12:11,544 --> 01:12:15,853
- So you think these kids are
with this bear, huh?

1026
01:12:16,027 --> 01:12:18,769
Well according to my GPS they
are, uh,

1027
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:21,511
headed north, what's up there?

1028
01:12:21,685 --> 01:12:23,295
- It's Grizzly Valley.

1029
01:12:23,469 --> 01:12:25,645
- I never seen a grizzly up
here, that's a myth.

1030
01:12:25,819 --> 01:12:27,386
- Uh, it's a
story people made up

1031
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,694
to keep everybody
away from the gold.

1032
01:12:30,868 --> 01:12:32,043
- Gold?

1033
01:12:32,217 --> 01:12:34,828
- Oh yeah, lots of gold

1034
01:12:35,002 --> 01:12:37,353
and lots of snakes.

1035
01:12:37,527 --> 01:12:39,137
- I don't like snakes.

1036
01:12:39,311 --> 01:12:40,573
- Well since you seem to know
where we're headed

1037
01:12:40,747 --> 01:12:43,663
why don't you head us to a
shortcut?

1038
01:12:43,837 --> 01:12:46,057
Come here you dang
things, come here.

1039
01:12:46,231 --> 01:12:49,190
Well they're pulling hard, they
want something.

1040
01:12:53,238 --> 01:12:54,500
- It's a deer.

1041
01:12:54,674 --> 01:12:56,372
- Yeah they got a little
excited.

1042
01:12:56,546 --> 01:12:59,679
- It seems a
little too excited to me.

1043
01:12:59,853 --> 01:13:01,028
- Come on let's go to Grizzly
Valley.

1044
01:13:01,202 --> 01:13:04,162
- I'm on your back Norwood.

1045
01:13:29,622 --> 01:13:33,017
- I can't go any farther.

1046
01:13:33,191 --> 01:13:36,194
I gotta rest.

1047
01:13:41,765 --> 01:13:44,724
I'm going to stay here tonight.

1048
01:13:47,988 --> 01:13:50,948
Good.

1049
01:14:02,916 --> 01:14:06,877
[wolves howl]

1050
01:14:10,794 --> 01:14:13,753
Let me know if they
get too close.

1051
01:14:23,589 --> 01:14:27,463
[wolves howl]

1052
01:14:27,637 --> 01:14:29,639
- These dogs, uh,

1053
01:14:29,813 --> 01:14:32,990
once they find a
bear they go after it?

1054
01:14:33,164 --> 01:14:34,774
- These dogs are all muscle,

1055
01:14:34,948 --> 01:14:36,254
can take down an elephant.

1056
01:14:36,428 --> 01:14:36,994
You'd be surprised what they
could do.

1057
01:14:37,168 --> 01:14:39,997
- Norwood.

1058
01:14:40,301 --> 01:14:43,217
This is all we need right here.

1059
01:14:43,391 --> 01:14:46,351
- What are you doing?

1060
01:14:52,966 --> 01:14:55,926
- See that?

1061
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:02,585
Put your hand down.

1062
01:15:07,894 --> 01:15:09,200
[wolves howling]

1063
01:15:09,374 --> 01:15:13,813
- Ah, that'll hold us.

1064
01:15:13,987 --> 01:15:17,034
Ah.

1065
01:15:17,208 --> 01:15:21,995
- Think Mark found a
safe place to sleep?

1066
01:15:22,169 --> 01:15:25,129
- I think the bear will protect
him from the wolves.

1067
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,655
- It's just so hard to believe.

1068
01:15:29,829 --> 01:15:32,615
[single wolf bark and howl]

1069
01:15:32,789 --> 01:15:35,182
- It's old wolf talking to his
relatives now.

1070
01:15:35,356 --> 01:15:38,534
- Indian legends.

1071
01:15:38,708 --> 01:15:41,667
- I was raised with them.

1072
01:15:45,671 --> 01:15:48,587
You know, my people have a story

1073
01:15:48,761 --> 01:15:51,242
about Jamickwa.

1074
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:54,506
The mother bear who found the
lost boy in the woods

1075
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:57,901
and raised him as her own.

1076
01:15:58,075 --> 01:16:00,164
One time on a hunt,

1077
01:16:00,338 --> 01:16:02,819
living in the woods,

1078
01:16:02,993 --> 01:16:04,603
my people called him Lamitta

1079
01:16:04,777 --> 01:16:07,693
Human who thinks like bear.

1080
01:16:07,867 --> 01:16:09,739
Oh when other humans came

1081
01:16:09,913 --> 01:16:13,220
I'll bet he could see that the
grizzlies would be destroyed.

1082
01:16:13,394 --> 01:16:15,614
So he gathered them all,

1083
01:16:15,788 --> 01:16:18,791
and he led them
to Grizzly Valley.

1084
01:16:18,965 --> 01:16:23,187
- Do you believe that?

1085
01:16:23,361 --> 01:16:25,842
- Well sitting out here

1086
01:16:26,016 --> 01:16:27,017
alone with the stars

1087
01:16:27,191 --> 01:16:30,063
and creatures of the night,

1088
01:16:30,237 --> 01:16:33,197
what do you believe?

1089
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:40,944
We'll find him, Jack.

1090
01:16:41,118 --> 01:16:44,077
I believe that.

1091
01:16:56,742 --> 01:16:58,570
[Ben quietly growls]

1092
01:16:58,744 --> 01:17:01,704
- Good morning, bear.

1093
01:17:08,972 --> 01:17:11,888
A jelly donut would taste good
right about now.

1094
01:17:19,025 --> 01:17:21,941
Come on, we got to get out of
here.

1095
01:17:43,441 --> 01:17:45,225
- How many?

1096
01:17:45,399 --> 01:17:47,619
- Three men,
two dogs.

1097
01:17:47,793 --> 01:17:50,100
- Gittis and Norwood.

1098
01:17:50,274 --> 01:17:51,623
- And by the looks of it,

1099
01:17:51,797 --> 01:17:54,757
Fog Benson.

1100
01:18:00,023 --> 01:18:02,634
- This dart could bring down a
rhino.

1101
01:18:02,808 --> 01:18:05,028
- There's a lot of footprints.

1102
01:18:05,202 --> 01:18:07,987
It's pretty obvious where
they're headed.

1103
01:18:08,161 --> 01:18:09,641
And there's wolf prints too.

1104
01:18:09,815 --> 01:18:12,862
- Let's go.

1105
01:18:28,181 --> 01:18:31,141
[dogs barking]

1106
01:18:50,116 --> 01:18:53,076
- Come on get the bear.
Come on move.

1107
01:18:58,864 --> 01:18:59,996
- The book says

1108
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:01,867
that this time of day

1109
01:19:02,041 --> 01:19:04,827
the shadow should
be pointing north.

1110
01:19:05,001 --> 01:19:07,917
Cully says the Three
Sisters are north.

1111
01:19:13,879 --> 01:19:16,360
That way.

1112
01:19:16,534 --> 01:19:18,014
Come on bear.

1113
01:19:18,188 --> 01:19:21,191
[bear grunts]

1114
01:19:26,936 --> 01:19:28,328
There it is.

1115
01:19:28,502 --> 01:19:31,418
The Three Sisters.

1116
01:19:31,592 --> 01:19:33,986
Once you're in Grizzly Valley,

1117
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:36,902
they'll never find you.

1118
01:19:37,076 --> 01:19:40,036
You'll be safe.

1119
01:19:42,908 --> 01:19:45,868
Come on bear.

1120
01:19:51,177 --> 01:19:52,831
- Do you see anything?

1121
01:19:53,005 --> 01:19:56,139
- Nothing moving.

1122
01:19:56,313 --> 01:19:58,010
- Well,

1123
01:19:58,184 --> 01:20:01,927
we'll catch them soon.

1124
01:20:02,101 --> 01:20:04,277
The trail is pretty fresh, isn't
it Norwood?

1125
01:20:04,451 --> 01:20:07,454
- It's not going to
get any fresher Gittis.

1126
01:20:07,628 --> 01:20:11,110
- What about the ranger?

1127
01:20:11,284 --> 01:20:14,244
- Well, we'll take care of that
when the time comes.

1128
01:20:20,685 --> 01:20:23,122
- Whoa, whoa, there,

1129
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,820
the ridge,

1130
01:20:24,994 --> 01:20:27,474
just below Three Sisters, right
there.

1131
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,911
- I don't believe it.

1132
01:20:29,085 --> 01:20:30,173
- I've never seen anything
like it

1133
01:20:30,347 --> 01:20:31,783
in my whole life
that's for sure.

1134
01:20:31,957 --> 01:20:35,091
The boy, the bear,

1135
01:20:35,265 --> 01:20:37,484
let's go.

1136
01:20:37,658 --> 01:20:38,964
- Come on,

1137
01:20:39,138 --> 01:20:42,098
come on dog get bear,
get bear.

1138
01:20:45,971 --> 01:20:48,931
[dogs barking very close]

1139
01:21:05,512 --> 01:21:08,254
- Grizzly Valley.

1140
01:21:08,428 --> 01:21:11,388
We made it.

1141
01:21:12,519 --> 01:21:15,479
This is as far as I go bear.

1142
01:21:15,653 --> 01:21:17,829
[bear groans]
No,

1143
01:21:18,003 --> 01:21:20,005
I can't go there.

1144
01:21:20,179 --> 01:21:22,007
It's your place.

1145
01:21:22,181 --> 01:21:23,617
I don't belong there any more

1146
01:21:23,791 --> 01:21:26,533
than you belong back where we
came from.

1147
01:21:26,707 --> 01:21:29,014
No.

1148
01:21:29,188 --> 01:21:31,103
We agreed.

1149
01:21:31,277 --> 01:21:34,454
I'd take you here but I can't go
with you.

1150
01:21:34,628 --> 01:21:37,893
I'm going to Los Angeles

1151
01:21:38,067 --> 01:21:39,372
and I don't belong
back there either.

1152
01:21:39,546 --> 01:21:42,506
[bear moans]

1153
01:21:43,637 --> 01:21:46,684
I gotta go now.

1154
01:21:57,129 --> 01:21:58,914
- Go.

1155
01:21:59,088 --> 01:22:02,134
Go you dumb bear.

1156
01:22:02,308 --> 01:22:05,224
I don't need you.

1157
01:22:05,398 --> 01:22:08,358
I don't need anybody.

1158
01:22:15,539 --> 01:22:19,543
[Bear Growls!]

1159
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:26,419
- There we go.

1160
01:22:28,726 --> 01:22:31,729
- Let's go.

1161
01:22:43,567 --> 01:22:46,613
Well Norwood look who we ran
into.

1162
01:22:46,787 --> 01:22:48,137
- Where's the bear boy.

1163
01:22:48,311 --> 01:22:50,748
- Keep them dogs away
from the boy.

1164
01:22:53,794 --> 01:22:57,407
Where's the...
[Bear roaring]

1165
01:22:57,581 --> 01:22:58,451
I'll shoot him,

1166
01:22:58,625 --> 01:23:00,323
get back, get him Gittis.

1167
01:23:00,497 --> 01:23:01,977
- Norwood.

1168
01:23:02,151 --> 01:23:05,632
- What are you waiting on, shoot
him.

1169
01:23:05,806 --> 01:23:08,984
- Bear stop.

1170
01:23:09,158 --> 01:23:09,941
Please stop.

1171
01:23:10,115 --> 01:23:13,118
- Dart him.

1172
01:23:13,292 --> 01:23:14,293
What are you waiting on?

1173
01:23:14,467 --> 01:23:16,252
- Stop.
Don't shoot him.

1174
01:23:16,426 --> 01:23:17,731
He's just protecting me.

1175
01:23:17,905 --> 01:23:20,517
- Now get out of the way son.

1176
01:23:20,691 --> 01:23:22,606
- No.

1177
01:23:24,825 --> 01:23:25,609
- Don't shoot Fog,

1178
01:23:25,783 --> 01:23:28,307
don't shoot.

1179
01:23:28,481 --> 01:23:30,701
- You don't need to shoot him,
it's okay.

1180
01:23:30,875 --> 01:23:31,963
- You're sure, Mark?

1181
01:23:32,137 --> 01:23:33,312
- Yeah, he won't hurt anybody

1182
01:23:33,486 --> 01:23:35,227
he's just protecting me.

1183
01:23:35,401 --> 01:23:37,664
- We were trying to protect the
boy, ranger.

1184
01:23:37,838 --> 01:23:39,405
- Yeah.

1185
01:23:39,579 --> 01:23:42,452
- Fog, you have no business
being up here.

1186
01:23:42,626 --> 01:23:45,368
- I'm here because that bear
attacked my sheep.

1187
01:23:45,542 --> 01:23:46,630
- Bear didn't hurt your sheep.

1188
01:23:46,804 --> 01:23:47,848
- Oh you don't,

1189
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:49,372
that boy doesn't know anything.

1190
01:23:49,546 --> 01:23:51,287
- Go ahead, Mark.

1191
01:23:51,461 --> 01:23:53,767
- We found the bear trapped in a
mine hole.

1192
01:23:53,941 --> 01:23:56,727
The bear was in the hole when
your sheep were taken.

1193
01:23:56,901 --> 01:23:58,337
- That's what Ashley said.

1194
01:23:58,511 --> 01:24:00,339
- The kids are lying to
save the bear.

1195
01:24:00,513 --> 01:24:02,385
- My daughter don't lie.

1196
01:24:02,559 --> 01:24:03,516
- The bear took your sheep.

1197
01:24:03,690 --> 01:24:04,561
- Something smaller than a

1198
01:24:04,735 --> 01:24:06,128
bear took your sheep Fog,

1199
01:24:06,302 --> 01:24:08,173
it was a wolf or dog.

1200
01:24:08,347 --> 01:24:09,783
- Yeah.

1201
01:24:09,957 --> 01:24:12,482
I saw their dog, he almost
killed a fox.

1202
01:24:12,656 --> 01:24:14,701
They had to pull him back.

1203
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:16,747
- You are such a little liar.

1204
01:24:16,921 --> 01:24:19,315
- No, honest.

1205
01:24:19,489 --> 01:24:22,492
- The boy is right Wedloe.

1206
01:24:24,363 --> 01:24:25,712
I've been studying these dogs,

1207
01:24:25,886 --> 01:24:30,369
they're out for blood.

1208
01:24:30,543 --> 01:24:31,762
- All right,

1209
01:24:31,936 --> 01:24:33,242
all right that's it,
that's it,

1210
01:24:33,416 --> 01:24:35,331
I got six CCs of tranquilizer in
this gun,

1211
01:24:35,505 --> 01:24:36,854
that's enough to drop an
elephant,

1212
01:24:37,028 --> 01:24:38,464
you can imagine what it can do
to a man.

1213
01:24:38,638 --> 01:24:41,380
- Show down is over,
put your weapons down.

1214
01:24:41,554 --> 01:24:45,602
- Put them down.

1215
01:24:45,776 --> 01:24:48,126
- Don't make it any worse than
it already is guys.

1216
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:49,693
- Norwood you and I are getting
out of here.

1217
01:24:49,867 --> 01:24:51,390
- Well you aren't
getting very far.

1218
01:24:51,564 --> 01:24:54,132
- I got 24 hours before they
miss you

1219
01:24:54,306 --> 01:24:55,655
and then I got another 24 hours
before they come

1220
01:24:55,829 --> 01:24:57,788
and they find you.

1221
01:24:57,962 --> 01:25:00,399
Norwood, would you give
me those dogs,

1222
01:25:00,573 --> 01:25:03,533
get their rifles.

1223
01:25:06,405 --> 01:25:08,190
- Now bear.

1224
01:25:08,364 --> 01:25:11,410
[bear growls]

1225
01:25:11,584 --> 01:25:12,672
- All right you,

1226
01:25:12,846 --> 01:25:15,806
let it go, let it go.

1227
01:25:21,681 --> 01:25:24,641
- Don't ever call my
daughter a liar.

1228
01:25:31,909 --> 01:25:35,347
- Come on.

1229
01:25:35,521 --> 01:25:37,610
- Good job, bear.

1230
01:25:37,784 --> 01:25:40,787
Good job.

1231
01:25:47,664 --> 01:25:49,492
- I see it,

1232
01:25:49,666 --> 01:25:52,625
I still don't believe it.

1233
01:25:55,454 --> 01:25:59,415
- In all my years I've only seen
one bear this friendly.

1234
01:25:59,589 --> 01:26:04,159
- I'm still not so sure about
this Cully.

1235
01:26:04,333 --> 01:26:06,683
- Tell them what you told me
about the eyes.

1236
01:26:06,857 --> 01:26:10,469
- Well I told you that when you
look into the bear's eyes,

1237
01:26:10,643 --> 01:26:12,819
you can see he's an old soul.

1238
01:26:12,993 --> 01:26:14,473
And the way he is with you,

1239
01:26:14,647 --> 01:26:18,782
I kind of think of him as a
gentle giant.

1240
01:26:18,956 --> 01:26:20,827
- He is.

1241
01:26:21,001 --> 01:26:22,133
Ben is a gentle old soul.

1242
01:26:22,307 --> 01:26:23,134
- Ben?

1243
01:26:23,308 --> 01:26:24,135
- Ben?

1244
01:26:24,309 --> 01:26:25,702
- Ben?

1245
01:26:25,876 --> 01:26:27,225
- It's Ashley's idea.

1246
01:26:27,399 --> 01:26:31,186
- I named him after Mark's Dad.

1247
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:34,319
- That's a good name.

1248
01:26:36,843 --> 01:26:37,801
- Come on Mark,

1249
01:26:37,975 --> 01:26:40,804
let's take Ben for a swim.

1250
01:26:44,024 --> 01:26:45,504
- That bear has no idea

1251
01:26:45,678 --> 01:26:48,638
what he's getting into with the
two of them.

1252
01:26:53,599 --> 01:26:57,386
- Ranger, are you going to let
that bear just hang around town?

1253
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:59,823
- The bear's name is Ben, Fog.

1254
01:26:59,997 --> 01:27:01,259
- Ben?

1255
01:27:01,433 --> 01:27:03,522
You named the bear Ben?

1256
01:27:03,696 --> 01:27:05,481
- That's right, so get used to
it.

1257
01:27:05,655 --> 01:27:06,482
- Wedloe,

1258
01:27:06,656 --> 01:27:07,700
you're an idiot.

1259
01:27:07,874 --> 01:27:10,268
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1260
01:27:10,442 --> 01:27:12,792
[LAUGHTER]

1261
01:27:12,966 --> 01:27:15,926
- Yeah, yeah.

1262
01:27:19,408 --> 01:27:21,540
- It seems as if Mark
and Ben came together

1263
01:27:21,714 --> 01:27:23,934
when they needed
each other the most.

1264
01:27:24,108 --> 01:27:27,198
I'm not sure how things are
going to end up for each of
them,

1265
01:27:27,372 --> 01:27:29,722
but what I am sure of is this,

1266
01:27:29,896 --> 01:27:33,857
it will be an
interesting journey.

1267
01:27:34,031 --> 01:27:37,034
