00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,510
We could seem them on eBay.

186
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,550
That's not bad.

187
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,660
But, if we take them to
 Vegas, we'd be a shoo-in

188
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,400
at blackjack or poker.

189
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,970
We'd be rich!

190
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,070
Do we dare?

191
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,540
We dare.

192
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,630

Ah!

194
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,220
So, finally, they sent
 the dreaded torturer Largo

00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,080
to extract Mao Myx's revenge.

196
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,700
Don't be so hasty, Natasha.

197
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,070
I have no intention
 of harming you.

198
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,770
By now Mao Myx is already on the
 trail of her missing property

199
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:06,250
and I have a feeling her mission
 will be a successful one.

200
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,590
Is that so?

201
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,970
Then why are you
 not here to kill me?

202
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,090
I have outlived my usefulness.

203
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:16,120
Mao Myx has special
 plans for you.

204
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,750
She intends to trade you for
 something that she wants.

205
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,570
But in the meantime, tell
 me the name of the operative

206
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,000
you sold the X-ray glasses to?

207
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,250
Why should you need
 that information now?

208
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,460
Mao Myx likes to know
 who her enemies are

209
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,130
and be thankful that
 you're not one of them.

210
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,320
If I tell you, how do I know
 that you will not kill me?

211

I would never kill
 anything as lovely as you.

 upon these decisions.

00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,460
Jesus, can't the
 guy just play one

364
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,840
honest game like everyone else?

365
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,340
Largo, you always
 know to make me purr.

366
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,680
It is my pleasure
 to please you.

367
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,900
Now, to our captives.

368
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,420
It's time to take out
 the trash as it were.

369
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,490
That meddling agent has
 been a thorn in my side

370
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:04,370
for way too long and the
 others just know too much.

371
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,410
Dispose of them in
 the usual fashion?

372
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,230
The usual fashion?

373
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:12,860
One shot to the head,
 saw up the bodies,

374
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,850
dissolve them in acid lime,
 then drive-through three states,

375
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,020
do-si-do.

376
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:21,320
Back through two states,
 then bury them, one third

377
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,850
each in separate
 baseball fields,

378
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,480
fly to Switzerland,
 legally change my name,

379
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,770
and then return to California,
 dressed as a woman.

380
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,680
Oh, please.

381
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,120
Nothing so routine.

382
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,240
No, kill the men and sell
 the women into white slavery.

383
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,160
That should bring in enough to
 at least pay for the Jacuzzi

384
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,050
I planned for the back deck.

385
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:44,490
Now, see to it immediately.

386
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:45,190
Drat.

387
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,430
Evil suits me.

388
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,810
It really suits me.

389
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:54,740
[LAUGHING]

390
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,290
Take it easy,
 psycho, take it easy.

391
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:12,990
Grab him!

392
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,400
You did it, baby!

393
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
Come on, everybody,
 let's go, let's go.

394
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,060
Taffy, come on.

395
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,500
I'm sorry, comrade.

396
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,480
I go my own way.

397
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,920
Catch you in the
 next Cold War, baby.

398
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,200
Yes, I'm very happy to report
 that the glasses are back

399
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,560
in my possession and
 ready for delivery.

400
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,660
Yes, the price is
 high, very high indeed.

401
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,520
But what do you expect?

402
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,470
There isn't another pair
 of X-ray glasses like them

403
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,650
in the entire world?

404
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:57,710
Shall I expect to see you later?

405
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,060
Excellent.

406
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,830
And please bring cash.

407
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:04,130
My bank puts a 10 day hold
 on checks over $30 million.

408
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,710
I look forward to
 finally meeting you.

409
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,110
Gimme me some.

410
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:37,110
Thank goodness we made it.

411
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,780
I thought we were
 goners for sure.

412
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,730
We're not out of
 the woods yet, Taffy.

413
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,320
What do you mean?

414
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,540
Well, the way I see it is
 that they know where you live.

415
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,540
So they probably think we
 would never be stupid enough

416
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,710
to come back here.

417
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,890
That's where they're wrong.

418
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:53,790
Right.

419
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:57,030
Now also, they know
 we know where they live

420
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:57,970
and what they're up to.

421
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:00,630
So, if we want to have
 any chance of catching

422
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,440
them and foiling them
 at their evil plans,

423
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,470
we're going to have
 to move quickly.

424
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,030
I don't have any
 hope of catching them

425
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,050
or foiling their evil plans.

426
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,500
How about you, Taffy, do you?

427
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,380
No.

428
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,180
Not me.

429
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,140
Hey, come on you two.

430
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,080
I just saved your lives.

431
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:20,480
Hey, we wouldn't have needed
 saving if it wasn't for you.

432
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,180
True, but if we
 don't do something,

433
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,960
you won't have any place
 to spend all that money.

434
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,060
Really.

435
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:28,760
Right.

436
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,460
Think about it.

437
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,110
It could happen.

438
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,010
Bank vault combinations
 would become useless,

439
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,410
national secrets compromised,
 lotto tickets would

440
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,320
become a thing of the past.

441
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,890
Lotto tickets?

442
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:40,790
Yeah, right.

443
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,590
Yeah, all right, well, I
 was stretching on that one.

444
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,820
But you get my point.

445
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,570
Look, even if we
 wanted to help you out,

446
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:51,270
what could the two of us do?

447
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,210
All right.

448
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:55,300
Intelligence thinks that Mao
 Myx's buyer is a wealthy Middle

449
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,310
Eastern man named Ram Singh.

450
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,510
We have not been able to
 produce a photograph of him,

451
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,780
but we don't think Mao
 Myx has met him either.

452
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:07,820
So I propose one of the two of
 you, Eddie, impersonate him.

453
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,420
Make the buy, get the
 glasses, bring them home,

454
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,620
and we're all heroes.

455
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,760
But could such a simple
 plan have any chance

456
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,950
whatsoever of working?

457
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,960
I don't have a better plan.

458
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,460
Oh, great.

459
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,610
[CRACK]

460
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:59,880
INTERCOM: Miss Mao Myx.

461
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,800
Yes.

462
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,520
INTERCOM: Your
 guests are arrived.

463
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,500
Excellent.

464
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,220
Show them in.

465
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:21,120
My dear Ram Singh, how
 delightful to finally meet you.

466
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,520
It is my pleasure.

467
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,200
Me too.

468
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,280
I see you brought the money.

469
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,040
It's all here.

470
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,260
It is quite a very, very lot.

471
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,160
$30 million is
 nothing to sneeze at.

472
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,000
Indeed.

473
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,530
Drink?

474
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,430
Yeah, I think we better--

475
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,010
by all means.

476
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,050
These X-ray glasses
 are very sought

477
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:02,260
after and you're very lucky
 to be able to afford them.

478
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,640
Everybody wanted them.

479
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,160
Yes, I would like to see them.

480
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:13,450
Of course.

481
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:16,120
My, my, my.

482
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,920
Oh, my.

483
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,830
They work exceptionally well.

484
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,440
I would not have
 believed it if I did not

485
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,540
see it with my very own eyes.

486
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,640
My dear Ram Singh,
 I do believe you're

487
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,940
undressing me with your eyes.

488
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,280
My glasses, please.

489
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,480
My apologies.

490
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,740
So, tell me, Ram?

491
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:45,250
What's it like in Moronico?

492
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,930
Moronico?

493
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:49,330
Yeah, where you live?

494
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:53,520
Oh, yes, yes, Moronico.

495
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,740
Well, it's a terrible
 place, full of sand

496
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,110
and camels and people
 that wear bed sheets

497
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,720
with towels on their head.

498
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,290
And oh, my god, the heat.

499
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:06,010
Such heat you would
 never believe it.

500
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:06,850
Sounds lovely.

501
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:09,460
You must send me a
 postcard sometime.

502
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,940
It does have its
 moments to be sure.

503
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,530
I'll bet.

504
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,490
Was it a long journey?

505
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:21,640
Ah, yes, yes, it was
 way, way over there.

506
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,680
My ass almost gave out
 on the plane ride here.

507
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,180
My ass did put
 out on the way here.

508
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,050
No, give out,

509
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:34,150
Yeah, give out.

510
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:37,060
You can remove that
 silly disguise, Ram Singh,

511
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,680
or whatever your name is.

512
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,320
Your little game has come
 to an unfortunate end.

513
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,910
You move over there.

514
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:45,340
Come on, move.

515
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,600
Ah!

516
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,420
Move it.

517
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,120
Keep going.

518
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,690
You too.

519
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:54,390
Keep moving.

520
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:01,210
Over there, get going, move.

521
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:03,340
Hey, what tipped you off.

522
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:07,040
Well, the real Ram Singh
 lives in Palm Springs

523
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,440
and would never be
 seen in the company

524
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,840
of such a cheap and common
 harem girl such as this.

525
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,710
Hey, I resemble that remark.

526
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:17,140
Well it's too bad that Largo
 isn't here to take care of you

527
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,070
personally.

528
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:21,730
But I have no problems
 killing both of you myself.

529
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,380
Whoa, whoa!

530
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,650
Don't you want to know who sent
 us or who were working for?

531
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,260
It's plain, don't you think?

532
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,180
You're obvious
 government agents.

533
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,980
They're all such bungling
 fools you couldn't even

534
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,270
find her ass with both hands.

535
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,100
That's a lie.

536
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,680
Either way, it's sayonara
 suckers for the two of you.

537
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,740
Better luck next time.

538
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,880
Hold it.

539
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,860
Not so fast, Mao Myx.

540
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,550
Hands up.

541
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,610
Taffy, grab the glasses.

542
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:48,310
Go.

543
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,010
Ooh.

544
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,740
To the left, to the right.

545
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,700
Right there.

546
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,420
Right there.

547
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,710
Good thing you showed up.

548
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,690
She was about to perforate us.

549
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,730
I had a feeling the two of
 you were going to blow it,

550
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:11,670
so I used you as a diversion to
 gain access into the mansion.

551
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:16,110
So we were just baiting
 your cleverly laid trap?

552
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,120
Sorry, Taffy.

553
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,110
Enough already.

554
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:20,750
Isn't talking something that's
 against the Geneva Convention?

555
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,660
Let's just get on with it.

556
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,410
Now what?

557
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,820
Here's where Largo
 creeps in behind you

558
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,070
and turns the table
 on all of you.

559
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:36,110
Very interesting, Mao
 Myx, but highly unlikely.

560
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:36,810
Hands up.

561
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,300
Drop the gun.

562
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,000
Ow.

563
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,570
Good work, Largo.

564
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:50,100
You will be rewarded.

565
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,580
I already have been.

566
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,030
You mean?

567
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,520
Yes, it's true.

568
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,270
Largo is going in
 business for himself.

569
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,640
And the money I make
 from selling these

570
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,800
I intend to buy small
 string of islands

571
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,090
off the coast of
 Southern Florida

572
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:06,840
and then probably name
 them after myself.

573
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,310
So, you'd betray me.

574
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,710
I like to call
 it diversification.

575
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,410
Ah!

578
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:47,730
Oh, no.

579
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:54,860
Busted.

580
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,880
Oh, dear.

581
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,920
Oh, dear, oh dear.

582
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,430
There goes my island.

583
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,800
There goes Vegas.

584
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,980
There goes Bachelor
 Parties Are Us.

585
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,770
Well, I guess there's
 nothing left to fight about.

586
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,940
Guess not.

587
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,680
I'm out.

588
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,270
I'm good.

589
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:26,080
So I guess we should
 all just go home.

590
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,100
That's a good idea, Taffy.

591
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,910
Let's get out of here.

592
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:33,250
Oh, beautiful house.

593
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,930
Really, it's lovely.

594
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:35,630
Thanks.

595
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,410
Next time.

596
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,160
I just wanted to
 thank the two of you

597
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,220
for risking your
 necks like that.

598
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,080
It's fun for
 about two minutes.

599
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,960
Not everybody would have taken
 the chances that you two did.

600
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,300
It's been quite
 an adventure, man.

601
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:20,980
I mean, finding the X-ray
 glasses, winning big in Vegas,

602
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:25,930
getting kidnapped, escaping,
 and finally turning the tables

603
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:28,780
on those evil bastards.

604
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,500
Yeah, we've had
 quite a busy week.

605
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,000
And we're grateful
 for all your help.

606
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,830
Ah, it was nothing.

607
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:38,300
I've been authorized by the
 agency to award the two of you

608
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,350
with this small token of your
 government's appreciation.

609
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,890
We'll treasure them forever.

610
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,570
Wear them with honor.

611
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,830
You can bet on it.

612
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:03,420
Now, for your
 bachelor party pleasure,

613
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:09,840
we have the sensuous,
 sweet, and sticky Taffy.

Who's phone number
 is that in your pocket?

615
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,020
I don't have any
 hope of catching them

616
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,460
or foiling their evil plans.

617
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,790
Oh, Largo, you always
 know how to make me purr.

618
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,800
Fly to Switzerland,
 legally change my name,

619
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,890
and then return to California,
 dress up as a woman.

620
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,360
I don't have a better plan.

621
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,320
Choose wisely.

What's in that case
 holds great power.

623
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,010
This is great news indeed.

624
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,880
I just might.

625
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,320
Got a long weekend coming up.
