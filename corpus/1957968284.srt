1
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:09,537
What do you want?

2
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,306
We're here to see Diego.

3
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:15,442
Well, everybody wants
to see Diego.

4
00:01:15,577 --> 00:01:17,144
Everybody doesn't get
to see Diego.

5
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:20,213
Just get Diego out here, man.
Time is money.

6
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,186
You wait right here.

7
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:28,556
And you better be on the level.

8
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:32,527
'Cause Diego gets really nasty
when people screw him around.

9
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:38,131
What the hell is this?

10
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,434
Keep cool, man. Just keep cool.

11
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:42,469
This could be a setup.

12
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:50,712
What about you, man?
You got the money or what?

13
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:52,647
Why don't you
show us the guns first?

14
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,583
Let's see the money first.

15
00:01:55,984 --> 00:01:57,417
Let's go. I'm wasting my time.

16
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,340
That's good.

17
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,175
-That's real good.
-Yeah.

18
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:26,179
Guess we're in business, man.
That's what I'm talking about.

19
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,447
Diego Montalban,

20
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:28,883
you're under arrest.

21
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,522
Shit! The feds!

22
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,730
Drop the gun!

23
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,934
Shit! Fuck!

24
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,110
Get down on your knees! Now!

25
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,278
Diego Montalban, drop your gun!

26
00:02:58,412 --> 00:02:59,479
Shit!

27
00:02:59,881 --> 00:03:01,181
Just take it easy.

28
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:04,052
Diego, you're
under arrest for murder,

29
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,319
arms dealing
and money laundering.

30
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,656
Sit your ass down.

31
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,361
That's funny, man.

32
00:03:15,063 --> 00:03:17,230
You guys know today's
my birthday?

33
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,666
Want me to sing you a song?

34
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,400
-Yeah, please.
-Get on your feet.

35
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:30,511
<i>The storm is</i>
<i>still hitting inland</i>

36
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:32,479
<i>at over 100 miles an hour.</i>

37
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,381
<i>The Coast Guard is</i>
<i>struggling to deal with</i>

38
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:37,417
<i>a large number</i>
<i>of vessels that</i>
<i>are in distress.</i>

39
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,592
<i>I'm sure it's been mentioned,</i>

40
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:46,293
<i>but it bears repeating,</i>

41
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,062
<i>this is not normal.</i>

42
00:03:48,196 --> 00:03:50,865
<i>Normally, water patterns</i>
<i>form so you can see the storms.</i>

43
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:54,168
<i>But this,</i>
<i>literally, came out of nowhere.</i>

44
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:55,803
Jimmy!

45
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,572
-My brother!
-How you doin'?

46
00:03:57,939 --> 00:03:59,439
Looks like a good party.

47
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:01,441
Let's go party,
it's our vacation time!

48
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:05,245
I want to
know what the problem is!

49
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,749
-Ma'am, I told you.
-Don't "ma'am" me.

50
00:04:07,882 --> 00:04:09,249
-There's inclement weather...
-Inclement weather?

51
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,852
...a storm
along the plane's path.

52
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:12,820
A storm?
Did you hear that? A storm.

53
00:04:12,954 --> 00:04:14,188
No, there's not.

54
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,624
Look outside,
it's perfectly sunny.

55
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:18,559
That's why
I said, "along the path."

56
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:20,427
Would you like me to
take your bags to be loaded?

57
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:21,863
There's a lot of guests
waiting behind you.

58
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:25,933
Fine, take my bag.
Come on, honey.

59
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,935
Thank you
for your understanding.

60
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:32,540
- Checking in?
- Yes, ma'am.

61
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:33,975
I have Chris Sizemore

62
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,342
and Michael Sizemore,
does that sound correct?

63
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:36,911
-That's correct.
-That's us.

64
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,646
All right, gentlemen,
if you want to put your bags

65
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,114
up here for me,
I can get those tagged for you.

66
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:41,448
Yeah, absolutely.

67
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:42,617
We'll definitely
be a lot less difficult

68
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,852
than the last lady.

69
00:04:44,986 --> 00:04:48,156
I greatly appreciate your
patience and understanding.

70
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:55,630
-Ooh! Right there.
-That's good.

71
00:04:57,732 --> 00:04:59,366
- Who's excited?
- Yeah.

72
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,638
Oh, can't wait. I'm so excited.

73
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:07,474
Check this girl out.

74
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:09,177
- Good to go?
- Yeah.

75
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,878
Have the few drinks.

76
00:05:11,012 --> 00:05:12,412
Oh, ooh, ooh!

77
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,414
- What?
- I'm so sorry.

78
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:15,950
I'm Brett.

79
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:18,286
Sorry, sorry.

80
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,353
I saw such a beautiful girl,

81
00:05:20,855 --> 00:05:22,990
I thought I'd come say hi,
you know what I mean?

82
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,894
Well, now you've said hi.
Are we done?

83
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,264
Don't bother with these types.

84
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,967
What do you mean by these types?

85
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,735
Lesbians.

86
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:36,938
What?

87
00:05:37,672 --> 00:05:40,842
Why don't you come here
and I'll tell you what I am.

88
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,713
I don't give a shit

89
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:47,982
if you think I'm gay, straight,

90
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:50,051
or the Virgin Mary.

91
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:53,120
Take a hint and fuck off.

92
00:05:57,592 --> 00:05:59,492
It's about
damn time you showed up.

93
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:01,461
I get it,
I get it. Everyone's sorry.

94
00:06:01,596 --> 00:06:02,864
I get it, I get it.

95
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:06,767
Oh, look, they're the pilots.

96
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:09,203
They must have
finished their vodka tonics.

97
00:06:09,337 --> 00:06:11,172
-Who knows?
-Maybe we can leave now.

98
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:12,773
Definitely.

99
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:14,242
Um, please take a seat,
make yourself comfortable.

100
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,643
We will be boarding shortly.

101
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:17,545
We'll go have a seat
and wait some more.

102
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,379
Like we haven't
been doing that all day.

103
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:20,615
Again, we are so sorry.

104
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:22,817
Yeah, I know. Everyone's sorry.

105
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,486
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

106
00:06:26,621 --> 00:06:28,055
<i>we are so sorry</i>
<i>for the extending delay.</i>

107
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:29,557
<i>Uh, we will be</i>
<i>boarding shortly,</i>

108
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,691
<i>so, please,</i>
<i>make yourself comfortable.</i>

109
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:32,093
<i>Have a great evening.</i>

110
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:43,004
Haven't escaped yet, I see.

111
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:45,640
Well, we got plenty of time,
so I'm not worried about it.

112
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:49,176
That's about all you do have,
is lots of time.

113
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,514
Gentlemen,
time to take the garbage out.

114
00:06:54,282 --> 00:06:55,816
Yes, sir. Let's go.

115
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:59,587
-I never forget a face.
-It's fine. Take a picture.

116
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:03,090
This looks like it
could be a lot of trouble.

117
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:06,761
Maybe we should skip this one
and get a later flight.

118
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:08,696
Nah.

119
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,097
They know what they're doing.

120
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:13,134
He looks real badass.
Must be famous.

121
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,635
Probably killed a lot of people.

122
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:15,803
I posted his photo already.

123
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:17,338
Somebody's going
to recognize him.

124
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,940
Better try to get
a seat next to him.

125
00:07:19,073 --> 00:07:21,409
-Good evening, ma'am.
-Are you on this flight, sir?

126
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:22,743
Afraid we are.

127
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:25,246
I'm FBI agent Victor Sweden

128
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:27,715
and that misfit
we just took through there,

129
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:30,952
is Diego Montalban,
convicted felon.

130
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:32,253
We're in the process

131
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:33,721
of taking him down
to the detention center,

132
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,488
now that he's legal
resident of Puerto Rico.

133
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:37,959
Hey, you guys haven't
heard of waiting in line,

134
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:39,193
like normal people?

135
00:07:39,327 --> 00:07:40,428
You're not special.

136
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,530
Only one that
sounds special here is you.

137
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:44,165
Hey, pig,
I said back of the line.

138
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,268
What, you want to
say something to me?

139
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:49,170
You have no idea what
I'd like to say to you.

140
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,771
Well, you're gonna have
to speak up.

141
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:52,139
Sir, please,
go back to your seat.

142
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:53,541
Let it go, Vic.

143
00:07:56,277 --> 00:07:58,846
- You might want to sit down.
- Plane, Vic.

144
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:01,349
-Lewis.
-Yes, sir.

145
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,584
I want you on that plane, too.

146
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,686
Think he might be some trouble?

147
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,789
I don't know.
Just in case, right?

148
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,158
Excuse me, um,

149
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:14,061
I need to talk to you, um,
about our newest passenger.

150
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:15,796
What exactly are
we dealing with here?

151
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,732
He's a very dangerous guy,

152
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,934
hence all the security detail.

153
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,736
You know,
it would have been nice

154
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:24,205
if we've been
briefed beforehand.

155
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:27,575
Please, rest assured,
my men are all professionals,

156
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,444
they're very well trained
in situations like this.

157
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:32,179
Okay, thanks.

158
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,017
Not to worry.

159
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,919
So, who do you think
is going to be the first one

160
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:42,023
to demand to see
the manager?

161
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:44,258
Who do you think?

162
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:47,928
So, what do you reckon
will be the cause?

163
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:49,830
Do you think it's
going to be the weather,

164
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:52,033
or do you think it's going
to be our friend over there

165
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,567
in handcuffs?

166
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:55,703
Amber Renée Sterling?

167
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,773
What have I told you
about talking to strangers?

168
00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:00,274
Sorry, Mom.

169
00:09:00,408 --> 00:09:02,109
Oh-- o-- oh, I'm sorry, ma'am,

170
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:05,980
I-- I really didn't--
I-- I'm sorry.

171
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:11,118
<i>Now boarding</i>
<i>flight PR 5623 to San Juan.</i>

172
00:09:16,424 --> 00:09:17,992
Good evening, gentlemen.

173
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:20,995
Thank you, enjoy your flight.

174
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:23,364
Hello, thank you.

175
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:25,466
Enjoy your flight.
- Jonas, is that you?

176
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,201
You haven't changed a bit.

177
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,569
Still as handsome as ever.

178
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,271
Oh, Irma,
thank you. How have you been?

179
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,206
I've been good, good.
Just going on vacation.

180
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:33,974
-What about you?
-The same, apparently.

181
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:36,043
Have you heard
anything about this hurricane?

182
00:09:36,177 --> 00:09:38,379
Just what I heard on the news,
so it should be over shortly,

183
00:09:38,513 --> 00:09:40,714
but by the time you get back
in the south, it'll be gone.

184
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:42,583
All right, sounds good.
I'll see you on the plane.

185
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:44,418
Enjoy your flight.

186
00:09:44,553 --> 00:09:46,654
- Hey, how you doing?
- Good, man, how you doing?

187
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:48,689
Hi.

188
00:09:48,823 --> 00:09:50,391
- Hi. Enjoying your vacation?
- Hi.

189
00:09:50,525 --> 00:09:53,794
Um, I hope so, I'm gonna
meet the guy I met online.

190
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:55,396
-What's his name?
-Matt.

191
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,797
And he's pretty hot, actually.

192
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:58,332
- Oh, really?
- Not as hot as you.

193
00:09:58,466 --> 00:10:01,235
Oh!
You're too kind, thank you.

194
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:08,175
County fair?
Sid, you're killing me.

195
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:10,177
I said arenas only.

196
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:12,780
We didn't have phones
back in the day.

197
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,982
The only cell was at the jail.

198
00:10:15,116 --> 00:10:17,084
We said goodbye in person.

199
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:19,653
Well, that's
a lovely story, Grandpapa,

200
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:22,223
but, uh, it was a quieter age.

201
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:23,891
A simpler time for sure.

202
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,759
Excuse me.

203
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:27,695
All this nostalgia is
just killing me. I mean,

204
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,430
"Oh, things were
better back in the day."

205
00:10:29,564 --> 00:10:31,165
- Blah, blah, blah, blah.
- Blah, blah, blah.

206
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,234
Yeah, you're not
really happy, I get it.

207
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:36,270
But we're going on
this trip to make you relax.

208
00:10:37,606 --> 00:10:38,973
He's my brother.

209
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:41,375
Uh, well, he's my stepbrother.

210
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:42,843
I'm Damon, by the way.

211
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,380
Forgive my careless brother.
I'm Jimmy.

212
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,917
-I'm Carolyn.
-Good to meet you.

213
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,853
I'll just leave
the two of you together.

214
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:58,025
So, uh, why are you
going to Puerto Rico?

215
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,394
I, uh...

216
00:11:01,262 --> 00:11:02,463
just need a break from work

217
00:11:02,597 --> 00:11:04,899
and some time to relax.

218
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,301
I understand.

219
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,574
-I got your phone call.
-Mm-hmm.

220
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,643
This is an
unprecedented situation.

221
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:15,743
Well.

222
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,778
If this hits social media,

223
00:11:17,912 --> 00:11:20,247
it will be really bad for us.

224
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:24,185
Well, look,
can we just re-- refuse to--

225
00:11:24,318 --> 00:11:25,386
to carry it?

226
00:11:26,387 --> 00:11:28,557
-No?
-No, I don't think so.

227
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,157
I mean, I would if I could.

228
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:33,427
-Um, I can go talk to him.
-Okay.

229
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:35,329
Is it that guy in first class?

230
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,199
He's hard to miss,
isn't he?

231
00:11:43,304 --> 00:11:45,706
-Mr. Montalban?
-Uh-oh.

232
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,341
I want you to know

233
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:51,011
this plane is equipped
to handle anything that you do.

234
00:11:51,412 --> 00:11:52,446
That's good.

235
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,016
Man, this--
this always makes me nervous.

236
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:57,484
Yeah? Why is that?

237
00:11:58,185 --> 00:11:59,654
You had a bad experience?

238
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:02,289
My dad was on a plane
that went down back in '83.

239
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:04,593
He happened to survive, though.

240
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:06,393
So, an event 40 years ago

241
00:12:06,528 --> 00:12:08,495
makes you nervous
for a flight right now?

242
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:10,431
I guess you got a point.

243
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:11,633
So, relax.

244
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:13,734
You got nothing to worry about.

245
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:16,770
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I guess you're right.

246
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:18,973
Hey, boy scout.

247
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:20,174
Wanna help me
with my seatbelt here?

248
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:22,544
-Huh?
-Do it your damn self.

249
00:12:22,677 --> 00:12:24,445
"Damn self?"
You from the south side?

250
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:26,280
-South side of Texas?
-The best side.

251
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,848
"The best side. The best side."

252
00:12:27,982 --> 00:12:30,685
Okay, uh--

253
00:12:31,686 --> 00:12:34,021
Hey, what about you, boy scout?
You want to help me out?

254
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:36,390
Jesus Christ.
What are you, a child?

255
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:38,325
My fucking
five-year-old can do this.

256
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,261
All right, well,
come and help me out, man.

257
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:43,297
- If this will shut you up.
- Yeah.

258
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:47,801
That's a good little girl scout
right there.

259
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,803
-Sit there--
<i>-Gracias!</i>

260
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:50,938
Sit there and shut up.

261
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,873
That's FBI right there, man,

262
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:54,441
to protect
and serve with a smile.

263
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:56,277
-Can I speak to you?
-Of course, you can.

264
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,445
-If I could just take this off.
-Shut up.

265
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:00,414
In the galley.

266
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:05,452
I'm Air Marshal Schneider.

267
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:07,689
I would appreciate
a heads up on the situation.

268
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:09,256
I come on the plane and find out

269
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,659
there's a convicted
felon on board.

270
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:13,060
Hope your men are
able to control him.

271
00:13:14,596 --> 00:13:15,597
We're good.

272
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,231
I see him causing you trouble,

273
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:18,633
I'm going to
restrain him myself.

274
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:20,301
Understood?

275
00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:29,977
Any sign of trouble from you,

276
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,412
I'll have no problem
duct taping you to that seat.

277
00:13:31,546 --> 00:13:33,380
-Do you understand?
-Okay.

278
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:35,482
We'll see how that goes.

279
00:13:35,617 --> 00:13:37,818
Yeah, I'll go eat a bag of nuts.

280
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,587
Not your nuts, hopefully.

281
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:40,789
Schneider.

282
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:43,157
I don't like this man aboard.

283
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:46,860
FBI Agent Sweden. Got ID on you?

284
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,929
Showed ID when
I went through security.

285
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:50,831
Obviously,
I'd like to see it again.

286
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:53,167
Is it against
law to go on vacation?

287
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,302
It's against law
not to give me your ID.

288
00:13:56,504 --> 00:13:58,138
California.
What is it you do there?

289
00:13:58,272 --> 00:14:00,874
A panel beater at a body shop.

290
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,209
Can you prove it?

291
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:05,112
Yeah, I'm on their websites.
Pure Paint Body.

292
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:08,982
What's this about?

293
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:10,384
Checks out.

294
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:12,587
Thank you. Have a good flight.

295
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:14,855
Always nice
helping law enforcement.

296
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:31,071
Autopilot is set.

297
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,207
What? Don't trust me
to get us there?

298
00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:38,112
You are a fine aviator, Francis.

299
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:40,247
-No doubt about that.
-Thanks.

300
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:42,950
It's me he doesn't trust.

301
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,119
Okay.

302
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:46,821
Get you guys
anything while I'm back there?

303
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:48,355
No, I'm good. Thanks, though.

304
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:49,923
- Soda, please.
- All right, what kind?

305
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,458
- Um, Sprite.
- All right. Great.

306
00:14:51,593 --> 00:14:53,360
-Excuse me.
-Oh, hey, Captain.

307
00:14:53,494 --> 00:14:55,162
- Hi. How are you?
- I'm doing well.

308
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:56,463
Are we expecting
any turbulence here?

309
00:14:56,598 --> 00:14:58,031
Oh, no. Actually,
we're doing pretty good.

310
00:14:58,165 --> 00:14:59,534
-All right.
-Take care now.

311
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:00,901
You, too.

312
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:03,805
-Excuse me. Was that the pilot?
-Yeah.

313
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,472
Are-- are we going to die?

314
00:15:05,607 --> 00:15:08,375
Oh, no, there's
another copilot in there,

315
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,578
it's just that he probably
had to use the restroom,

316
00:15:10,712 --> 00:15:11,979
or get a drink or something.

317
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,581
I assure you
that it's perfectly normal.

318
00:15:13,715 --> 00:15:15,349
Um, is there anything
else I can get either of you?

319
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:17,786
No, thank you.

320
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:19,319
I've got a screaming kid
in my ear.

321
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:21,221
I was hoping somebody
could help me with this.

322
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:22,791
Can I get an upgrade
or something?

323
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,759
Um, we have a couple of seats
in first class, sir,

324
00:15:24,893 --> 00:15:26,226
but I'm afraid they're reserved
for the prisoner transport,

325
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,695
so, I don't know
how you feel about that,

326
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:28,830
but are you interested?

327
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,264
Yeah, I'll take a pass on that.

328
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:31,900
I thought you might.
Okay, thank you.

329
00:15:46,714 --> 00:15:50,050
-Mom, where is he going?
-It's fine.

330
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,858
-What the fuck is going on?
-We got struck by lightning.

331
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,192
Is everything working?

332
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,027
Powers out just for--
Just a second.

333
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,129
How the fuck did you fly us
into a storm?

334
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:04,666
-I'm telling you, I didn't.
-It came out of nowhere.

335
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,837
Come on, baby.
Come on, you piece of shit.

336
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:12,072
Well, we're going to be fine.

337
00:16:13,575 --> 00:16:15,777
- Are we?
- What's happening?

338
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,077
Everything's gonna be all right.

339
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:19,346
Okay, just breathe.
Just breathe.

340
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,249
If every would just please,
sit down and relax.

341
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:24,084
We were waiting
for the storm to leave.

342
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:25,385
Why is this happening?

343
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,054
I don't--
I don't know why it's happening.

344
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:28,388
It's okay, honey.

345
00:16:28,523 --> 00:16:30,057
He's going to
do the best he can.

346
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,559
We need to do something.
People are scared.

347
00:16:31,693 --> 00:16:33,494
I understand you're
all very deeply concerned,

348
00:16:33,628 --> 00:16:35,195
but if you'll
please just take your seats,

349
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,130
I'll find out but
I need to get through here now,

350
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:39,132
please, just--
I need to get through here,

351
00:16:51,546 --> 00:16:54,314
Sit down!

352
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:59,419
Federal Marshal, folks.
Stay in your seats, stay calm.

353
00:17:00,955 --> 00:17:02,724
Hi, Vic.
Having a bad day, buddy?

354
00:17:02,857 --> 00:17:04,424
Fuck you.

355
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:08,262
Get me a first aid kit.
I'm a nurse. Get it now!

356
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:10,330
Help him!

357
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:13,033
Stay with me.

358
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:16,604
Don't close your eyes.

359
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:23,811
No! No!

360
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:31,151
Tower, this is flight PR 5623.

361
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:34,288
We have run into
severe weather up here,

362
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:36,123
and we have lost
our number one engine.

Tower, you've got to be looking
at the wrong screen.

379
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,422
What the fuck is going on?

380
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:10,592
Holy shit!

00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:12,060
Come on, baby.

382
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,669
Get back there.

383
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,370
Now, we're going down.

384
00:18:23,805 --> 00:18:25,707
- We're what?
- Just get back here.

385
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,042
We're going to
assume the brace position.

386
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:29,877
We're going to fucking crash.

387
00:18:31,813 --> 00:18:33,113
We are going to go down.

388
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:34,582
Put seat belts on tight

389
00:18:34,716 --> 00:18:35,950
and have them
assume the position, okay?

390
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:37,317
We're gonna crash?

391
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:38,953
- What?
- Did he just say crash?

392
00:18:39,087 --> 00:18:40,521
Everyone, please,
buckle your seats now!

393
00:18:40,655 --> 00:18:42,957
We're going down.

394
00:18:43,091 --> 00:18:44,257
Okay, everyone,

395
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:45,727
I need you to
remain in your seats

396
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,894
and stay calm.

397
00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:48,261
Buckle up
and assume the position.

398
00:18:50,064 --> 00:18:52,199
Ow!

399
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:53,467
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

400
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:54,869
Please, remain seated!

401
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:56,904
Shit!

402
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,643
Father, please forgive me.

403
00:19:01,776 --> 00:19:03,878
Thy kingdom come, it will be
done in the name of Jesus.

404
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:10,118
Check her pulse.

405
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:24,364
ID.

406
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:58,566
Oh, God!

407
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,474
That sure was a shitshow.

408
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,044
Been through worse.

409
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:20,447
At least
nobody's shooting at us.

410
00:21:20,815 --> 00:21:22,550
Kind of wish
we were in the shit.

411
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:24,752
At least we know
who the enemy is.

412
00:21:24,886 --> 00:21:26,687
We'd know where we're at.

413
00:21:26,821 --> 00:21:29,090
Hey, is this, uh, Puerto Rico?

414
00:21:29,223 --> 00:21:30,591
No, bro.

415
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:32,927
I've never seen this
part of the island before.

416
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:37,598
Who do I have to sue over this.

417
00:21:37,732 --> 00:21:39,200
Hold on.

418
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:40,668
This is unacceptable.

419
00:21:41,636 --> 00:21:42,904
Hey, are you all right?

420
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:46,541
Do I look all right? God.

421
00:21:46,674 --> 00:21:49,110
I-- I got makeup in my eyes.

422
00:21:49,777 --> 00:21:51,712
My hair dye is running.

423
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,615
My chest tattoos are melting.

424
00:21:55,183 --> 00:21:57,718
I got sand in my pits.

425
00:21:57,852 --> 00:21:59,587
Come on, let me--
let me help you, okay?

426
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,622
Just-- Come on.

427
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,792
Darling. Shall we?

428
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:09,831
One job.

429
00:22:10,598 --> 00:22:12,332
Couldn't even keep
the plane in the air.

430
00:22:14,035 --> 00:22:16,237
When we get
back to civilization,

431
00:22:16,771 --> 00:22:19,907
I'm filing
complaints with the FAA

432
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,408
and your superiors.

433
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:23,878
I'm telling
everybody about this,

434
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:26,581
starting with the news outlets.

435
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:29,482
Hell, I'm even
gonna tell the kids

436
00:22:29,617 --> 00:22:31,285
down at the burger shop.

437
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:34,188
What kind of asshole

438
00:22:34,689 --> 00:22:37,892
flies directly into a storm?

439
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:41,494
-We didn't.
-It came out of nowhere.

440
00:22:41,863 --> 00:22:44,732
The hell do
you mean it came from nowhere?

441
00:22:44,866 --> 00:22:47,268
Clear skies,
visibility, no wind.

442
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,637
Then bam. Rain, lightning.

443
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:50,805
I blinked, We were in the middle

444
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:52,773
-of a storm.
-Bullshit.

445
00:23:03,317 --> 00:23:05,720
You got a little bit
of wind on you, buddy.

446
00:23:06,187 --> 00:23:07,454
Would you give it a break?

447
00:23:07,588 --> 00:23:09,123
He probably
doesn't even speak English.

448
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:11,659
Oh, I speak English.

449
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:15,997
I just tend not to
address.

450
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,365
Hey, look.

451
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:19,000
That guy needs help. Come on.

452
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:25,438
I got you, homie.

453
00:23:30,211 --> 00:23:31,379
Almost there.

454
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:41,722
What happened?

455
00:23:42,523 --> 00:23:43,824
Where are we?

456
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:46,961
We crashed.
That's all we know right now.

457
00:23:47,395 --> 00:23:49,030
Something about a storm.

458
00:23:49,797 --> 00:23:51,565
I'm gonna
get you some drink of water.

459
00:23:51,699 --> 00:23:53,634
Yeah, I'll go get some.

460
00:23:53,768 --> 00:23:56,170
Anyone have directions
to the nearest bodega?

461
00:24:15,623 --> 00:24:17,692
First one that wins

462
00:24:17,825 --> 00:24:19,527
gets whatever we find to eat.

463
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,928
Yeah.

464
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:22,730
Card up.

465
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:24,966
-King
-I like it.

466
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:26,067
Two kings.

467
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:47,621
How you doing?
How you holding up?

468
00:24:48,055 --> 00:24:49,824
Pretty good. How about you?

469
00:24:50,424 --> 00:24:51,993
Mm. A little tired.

470
00:24:52,593 --> 00:24:55,196
You got a nasty wound here, pal.

471
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:56,330
Oh, yeah.

472
00:24:56,464 --> 00:24:58,265
Well, if you keep picking at it,

473
00:24:58,399 --> 00:24:59,767
it will never get better.

474
00:25:00,868 --> 00:25:03,137
That is a sick wound.

475
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,506
Would make for one
hell of an album cover.

476
00:25:06,607 --> 00:25:08,509
I'm in the industry.

477
00:25:10,277 --> 00:25:12,113
Name is Midnight.

478
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:15,649
Baphomet Records.

479
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,219
Great. Are you going to help?

480
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:19,920
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

481
00:25:20,421 --> 00:25:24,892
We want to survive
as long as we possibly can.

482
00:25:25,026 --> 00:25:26,927
I thought you people love death.

483
00:25:27,294 --> 00:25:29,296
Well, yes, it's true.

484
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,432
We do acknowledge death,

485
00:25:31,565 --> 00:25:33,968
but who doesn't, really?

486
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:36,737
We just realize

487
00:25:36,871 --> 00:25:40,174
that death is
a part of existence.

488
00:25:40,307 --> 00:25:43,044
I want to get as far
down that track as possible.

489
00:25:44,745 --> 00:25:45,813
Great story and all,

490
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,616
but I still got this issue,
the glass in my arm.

491
00:25:48,749 --> 00:25:50,217
Right, so...

492
00:25:51,052 --> 00:25:52,521
count of three, shall we?

493
00:25:52,953 --> 00:25:56,525
-One.
-One, two,

494
00:25:56,657 --> 00:25:58,159
three.

495
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:18,112
Oh, uh, Amber, look at me.

496
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:19,313
Look at me, please.

497
00:26:21,015 --> 00:26:22,583
She'll need to put a shirt on.

498
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:25,953
We've only been
here a couple hours.

499
00:26:27,088 --> 00:26:28,557
It's gonna get
a hell of a lot hotter,

500
00:26:28,689 --> 00:26:29,757
before it starts easing off.

501
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:32,093
Don't you think
it's a little late for that?

502
00:26:32,927 --> 00:26:34,261
You want to go for a walk?

503
00:26:34,395 --> 00:26:35,796
Check out the rest of the beach?

504
00:26:36,831 --> 00:26:38,567
Let's go, let's go.

505
00:26:38,699 --> 00:26:40,034
- Yeah.
- Hey.

506
00:26:40,868 --> 00:26:42,103
Get your ass back to work.

507
00:26:43,704 --> 00:26:45,005
That looks painful.

508
00:26:46,907 --> 00:26:47,975
Definitely.

509
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:49,276
- Hey.
- Yeah.

510
00:26:49,844 --> 00:26:51,345
Hey, I'm doing it.

511
00:26:52,246 --> 00:26:54,682
-It's not good.
-Nope.

512
00:26:56,851 --> 00:26:58,419
Did you find any of the others?

513
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,287
No one else.

514
00:27:00,688 --> 00:27:02,690
Everyone who survived
must have washed up here.

515
00:27:07,194 --> 00:27:08,896
How many people
were on that plane?

516
00:27:10,064 --> 00:27:13,033
-Hundreds.
-Look how many survived.

517
00:27:16,203 --> 00:27:17,371
Look.

518
00:27:17,506 --> 00:27:19,541
We're not out of the woods yet.

519
00:27:20,341 --> 00:27:22,409
And I fear our numbers
may drop further.

520
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,515
But we need Amber. Huh?

521
00:27:26,947 --> 00:27:29,618
We will light a candle
for those who have passed,

522
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,919
when we get
back to civilization.

523
00:27:32,621 --> 00:27:34,755
-All right?
-Okay.

524
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:37,958
I saw some horses.

525
00:27:38,092 --> 00:27:40,694
Well, now.

526
00:27:40,828 --> 00:27:42,496
I'm going to play cowboy,

527
00:27:43,063 --> 00:27:44,732
I'm going to need my hat.

528
00:27:48,102 --> 00:27:49,837
- Hey, a boat.
- Yeah.

529
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,372
Maybe we can get out of here.

530
00:27:51,506 --> 00:27:52,673
Let's check it out.

531
00:27:52,806 --> 00:27:54,308
Maybe we can fix it.

532
00:27:54,441 --> 00:27:56,377
Well, I'm going to go
see if I can find any supplies.

533
00:27:56,511 --> 00:27:57,778
Sure.

534
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:13,961
Yeah, I don't think
we can fix this.

535
00:28:16,598 --> 00:28:17,965
Mags?

536
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:20,334
Mags?

537
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:25,839
Mags?

538
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:33,214
Mags, where are you?

539
00:28:40,821 --> 00:28:42,056
What is that?

540
00:28:42,591 --> 00:28:43,824
Maggie?

541
00:28:46,193 --> 00:28:48,929
- Yeah.
- Mags, what the fuck?

542
00:28:49,063 --> 00:28:52,601
- Careful!
- Oh, my God.

543
00:28:54,969 --> 00:28:56,170
- Sorry.
- Let's go this way.

544
00:28:56,303 --> 00:28:58,506
Oh, my God. Dude.

545
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,274
What were you
looking for down there?

546
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:02,943
- For you.
- Why would I be down there?

547
00:29:03,077 --> 00:29:08,215
Get off of me, get off me.
Damn seagulls. Get away from me!

548
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:12,654
I-- I-- I was just
having a, um--

549
00:29:12,786 --> 00:29:15,222
-Having a nightmare?
-Yeah, uh--

550
00:29:15,624 --> 00:29:17,491
What happened to us?

551
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:20,327
If we had crashed
anywhere near town,

552
00:29:20,461 --> 00:29:22,329
there would be
people coming out here now.

553
00:29:23,998 --> 00:29:25,299
Looks like we're on our own.

554
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,536
We're going to
start surviving, okay?

555
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:32,773
I really want to help,
but I just don't know how.

556
00:29:32,906 --> 00:29:34,308
When do we get to eat?

557
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:36,143
If I had some food,
I'd give it to you,

558
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:39,380
but it looks like we're
all under the same circumstances

559
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,382
Now, what we need
the most is water.

560
00:29:41,516 --> 00:29:44,351
-Where did you get that?
-Right out there.

561
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,187
From the ocean?

562
00:29:48,322 --> 00:29:51,693
Dude, do not,
under any circumstances,

563
00:29:51,825 --> 00:29:53,260
drink ocean water, come on.

564
00:29:53,394 --> 00:29:55,563
We can walk around the island,
try to find a river.

565
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,600
You know, in a pinch...

566
00:29:59,366 --> 00:30:01,435
you can drink your own urine.

567
00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:02,570
Ew.

568
00:30:02,704 --> 00:30:04,539
I mean, it doesn't taste great,

569
00:30:04,673 --> 00:30:07,041
but it gets the job done.

570
00:30:07,709 --> 00:30:09,343
We just need to build something.

571
00:30:09,843 --> 00:30:11,111
Like what?

572
00:30:11,245 --> 00:30:13,180
Maybe we can build
something off the ground.

573
00:30:14,148 --> 00:30:15,717
Protect us from enemies.

574
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:17,552
We need to find a clear space.

575
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:20,921
It's a lot easier
than clearing it ourselves.

576
00:30:21,523 --> 00:30:23,857
Then, we build
a barrier around us.

577
00:30:24,258 --> 00:30:25,593
A man with a plan.

578
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:29,531
I like it. Let's do it.

579
00:30:51,285 --> 00:30:52,419
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

580
00:30:52,821 --> 00:30:54,689
we don't know how long
we're going to be out here

581
00:30:54,823 --> 00:30:56,423
on this island.

582
00:30:56,558 --> 00:30:58,425
Our first priority right now
needs to be to build a shelter.

583
00:30:58,793 --> 00:30:59,960
We need food.

584
00:31:00,094 --> 00:31:00,994
That should be
our first priority.

585
00:31:01,128 --> 00:31:02,463
There's no point in eating

586
00:31:02,597 --> 00:31:04,365
if our bodies are just
going to be left out here to die

587
00:31:04,498 --> 00:31:05,767
in this environment.

588
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:07,234
There's no point
in having shelter

589
00:31:07,368 --> 00:31:09,169
if we're just lying there,
starving to death.

590
00:31:11,105 --> 00:31:12,406
This is survival.

591
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,475
No one gives a shit
about your opinion.

592
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:17,579
Oh, girls,
put your claws away.

593
00:31:17,978 --> 00:31:20,280
I'd say you're both right.

594
00:31:20,414 --> 00:31:22,950
There's no reason
why we can't do both plans.

595
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,452
We have enough people here.

596
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:26,954
Fine.

597
00:31:27,087 --> 00:31:28,489
Two groups.

598
00:31:28,623 --> 00:31:31,258
You go find your food.
We can build a shelter.

599
00:31:31,626 --> 00:31:35,095
-Does that work for you?
-Oh, tip-top. Vicky.

600
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:36,930
Maybe we can build a raft

601
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:38,800
and try to get
the hell out of here.

602
00:31:38,932 --> 00:31:40,535
You gonna lend me your axe?

603
00:31:40,668 --> 00:31:43,571
How about enough of your sarcasm
and you do something important?

604
00:31:44,171 --> 00:31:45,906
Listen, even if we built one,

605
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:47,274
we still don't
know which way to go.

606
00:31:47,408 --> 00:31:49,343
All right, so what is the plan?

607
00:31:49,476 --> 00:31:52,479
Whatever it is,
we should get started.

608
00:32:27,214 --> 00:32:28,449
What are we looking for?

609
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:30,250
I don't know, just...

610
00:32:30,785 --> 00:32:32,654
anything that can
be considered food.

611
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:36,390
Careful where you step.

612
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:38,258
Could be snakes.

613
00:32:38,392 --> 00:32:41,028
If we step on one
and it doesn't bite us,

614
00:32:41,161 --> 00:32:42,730
we could always kill it.

615
00:32:42,864 --> 00:32:43,932
Snakes?

616
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:45,934
Keeps getting better and better.

617
00:32:46,366 --> 00:32:47,569
Don't worry about it, man.

618
00:32:47,702 --> 00:32:50,070
I had a friend
that collected snakes.

619
00:32:50,204 --> 00:32:51,906
He said you can
tell the poisonous ones

620
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:53,273
by the markings.

621
00:32:53,407 --> 00:32:54,642
But then again,
when you get close enough

622
00:32:54,776 --> 00:32:56,376
to look at them,
you're in the danger zone.

623
00:32:56,511 --> 00:32:58,412
I hate snakes.

624
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,651
Ow! Damn it.

625
00:33:04,218 --> 00:33:05,587
Amber Renée Sterling.

626
00:33:06,286 --> 00:33:07,856
What have I told
you about cursing?

627
00:33:08,021 --> 00:33:09,423
'Atta girl. Keep it up.

628
00:33:09,557 --> 00:33:11,593
We're going to need
that to stay warm.

629
00:33:17,264 --> 00:33:18,999
-Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.
-What?

630
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:21,636
-Do you know what that is?
-No.

631
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,772
All right, listen up, everybody.

632
00:33:24,906 --> 00:33:27,709
If you find something to eat
and you don't know what it is,

633
00:33:27,842 --> 00:33:29,476
just don't eat it, okay?

634
00:33:29,611 --> 00:33:31,713
There's plenty of stuff
out here that can kill us.

635
00:33:37,685 --> 00:33:40,320
So, how do we know if
anything's safe to eat here?

636
00:33:40,922 --> 00:33:42,322
How are we supposed to test it?

637
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,526
Just try it, I guess.

638
00:33:45,425 --> 00:33:47,394
If you're okay, tomorrow
we can come back for more.

639
00:33:48,328 --> 00:33:50,097
Well, we could draw lots

640
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,834
and loser has to eat shit.

641
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,637
Or, maybe, we could vote on it

642
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:58,338
and the loser
has to eat everything.

643
00:33:58,873 --> 00:34:00,842
Well, then,
you're probably screwed.

644
00:34:02,577 --> 00:34:05,145
Calm down. Calm down.
Let's just, you know, relax.

645
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,447
Calm down.

646
00:34:07,582 --> 00:34:09,483
Well, you're
our fearless leader.

647
00:34:09,617 --> 00:34:12,119
So why aren't you out
there volunteering, hm?

648
00:34:12,252 --> 00:34:14,656
I mean, what exactly
is the grand plan?

649
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:17,759
Is it just to stay here
and slowly starve

650
00:34:17,892 --> 00:34:20,728
and then go pick shit
off of the bushes willy-nilly?

651
00:34:21,328 --> 00:34:23,397
Look, I only know
so much about survival,

652
00:34:23,531 --> 00:34:25,365
and most of that is
the shit I've seen on TV.

653
00:34:25,499 --> 00:34:28,036
I don't think Vic,
or any of us for that matter,

654
00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:29,436
knows too much more.

655
00:34:32,372 --> 00:34:35,043
Guys, let's split into pairs.

656
00:34:35,543 --> 00:34:37,011
Stay close to your buddy,

657
00:34:37,277 --> 00:34:40,048
and if you find something,
say something.

658
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,149
And who put you in charge?

659
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:46,420
Do you have a better plan?

660
00:34:49,557 --> 00:34:51,893
All right, guys.
Just relax, okay?

661
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,928
I think it's a great plan.

662
00:34:54,294 --> 00:34:55,262
All right.

663
00:34:55,395 --> 00:34:57,297
I'll take as my partner,

664
00:34:57,431 --> 00:34:59,199
uh-- uh, what's your name again?

665
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:00,602
Akira.

666
00:35:00,735 --> 00:35:03,236
Yes, my good,
faithful companion.

667
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,506
Akira and I will
head over this way

668
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,842
and, uh, see what we can find.

669
00:35:09,077 --> 00:35:11,311
Shall we sally forth? Yes.

670
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,246
Let's go.

671
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:19,286
Hey, uh, do you know Amber?

672
00:35:19,419 --> 00:35:22,056
She says she saw
wild horses on this island,

673
00:35:22,189 --> 00:35:25,359
so maybe we can capture
one of them and eat it.

674
00:35:25,793 --> 00:35:28,630
Oh, do you have
any home recipes for horse?

675
00:35:30,163 --> 00:35:31,498
Why would I?

676
00:35:32,332 --> 00:35:36,070
I am joking, darling.
I'm joking.

677
00:35:36,203 --> 00:35:40,207
I-- it's just that once
I was in the Alps on tour,

678
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:44,144
and I had an exquisite,
<i>Hirschenrouladen</i>

679
00:35:44,277 --> 00:35:46,547
in a Bavarian farm village. Oh!

680
00:35:46,914 --> 00:35:48,950
Now, the Germans,
they sort of frown upon

681
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:51,819
that sort of thing,
but if you have enough of this,

682
00:35:51,953 --> 00:35:54,488
they'll let you get away with,
you know a little--

683
00:36:01,228 --> 00:36:02,630
Uh, let's see.

684
00:36:02,764 --> 00:36:04,999
Let's see if we
can find some more nuts.

685
00:36:05,133 --> 00:36:06,400
I mean,
I already got two myself,

686
00:36:06,534 --> 00:36:08,301
- but, you know--
- nuts.

687
00:36:08,435 --> 00:36:10,738
Hey, you got three.
You're doing well, man.

688
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:12,640
More than me.

689
00:36:14,742 --> 00:36:16,611
Let's see if there's
anything higher up.

690
00:36:16,744 --> 00:36:19,580
Maybe we'll be lucky
to find one of those lizards.

691
00:36:24,152 --> 00:36:25,953
- Is that a crab?
- Huh?

692
00:36:27,021 --> 00:36:29,489
-Hey, check this out.
-Oh, that's cool.

693
00:36:30,457 --> 00:36:31,859
Let me try to get it.

694
00:36:31,993 --> 00:36:33,260
-Okay.
-Okay.

695
00:36:35,997 --> 00:36:38,633
Careful.

696
00:36:40,267 --> 00:36:41,602
I think we can eat this.

697
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:43,638
Grab it.

698
00:36:49,544 --> 00:36:53,948
Akira,
look what I found! Shit.

699
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:58,418
What do we have here?

700
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,823
Here, horsey, horsey, horsey.

701
00:37:02,824 --> 00:37:04,224
Come to Midnight.

702
00:37:10,631 --> 00:37:12,166
So, you think there's any fish,

703
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:13,735
or anything
we can catch in there?

704
00:37:13,868 --> 00:37:15,402
Maybe piranhas?

705
00:37:15,536 --> 00:37:17,437
No, no, no, no, no.
There could be alligators.

706
00:37:17,572 --> 00:37:19,306
They like to lay and wait.

707
00:37:20,007 --> 00:37:21,408
Maybe we should split up.

708
00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:23,044
We'll cover
more ground that way.

709
00:37:23,443 --> 00:37:25,513
Okay. I'll go this way.

710
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:09,957
Wow.

711
00:38:19,634 --> 00:38:21,301
What is this place?

712
00:38:33,047 --> 00:38:34,314
Hello?

713
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,921
Akira.

714
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,410
No, no, no.

715
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,023
-Is that Dawkins?
-I think so.

716
00:39:57,397 --> 00:39:58,699
Hey, Dawkins?

717
00:40:00,835 --> 00:40:04,572
Dawkins!

718
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:08,142
What the--

719
00:40:10,477 --> 00:40:12,179
-Damon.
-Wait, hold on.

720
00:40:14,282 --> 00:40:15,783
I think there's
something out there.

721
00:40:20,955 --> 00:40:23,791
Is that an arm?

722
00:40:25,526 --> 00:40:28,162
Oh, oh, oh!

723
00:40:35,503 --> 00:40:37,004
Y'all should run.

724
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:39,373
Just-- Come on!

725
00:40:57,658 --> 00:41:00,728
What the fuck?

726
00:41:07,101 --> 00:41:10,137
It's gonna take more than you
to fucking take me down.

727
00:41:29,623 --> 00:41:30,891
Was that...

728
00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:33,361
Dawkins's arm?

729
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:35,296
I think so.

730
00:41:35,429 --> 00:41:36,897
All right.

731
00:41:37,031 --> 00:41:38,498
So, who are you people,
and what are you doing here?

732
00:41:38,632 --> 00:41:40,001
Where the hell
did you come from?

733
00:41:40,134 --> 00:41:41,936
Say, if I hadn't
just stepped in now,

734
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:43,437
every single one
of you would be dead,

735
00:41:43,571 --> 00:41:45,106
so I'd appreciate it,

736
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:46,774
if you would answer my goddamn
questions when I ask them.

737
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:48,809
We were flying to
Puerto Rico, when our--

738
00:41:48,943 --> 00:41:50,244
our plane went down and...

739
00:41:51,178 --> 00:41:54,115
-we wound up here.
-Shit.

740
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:57,785
I think now I'd give up
hoping for a rescue party.

741
00:41:58,552 --> 00:42:00,321
I'm sorry, man, but, uh...

742
00:42:01,622 --> 00:42:02,957
we're not a rescue party.

743
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:04,358
Didn't you see that
plane that went down?

744
00:42:04,825 --> 00:42:06,560
No, I, uh...

745
00:42:07,461 --> 00:42:08,796
I keep to myself.

746
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:12,700
Well, we're all that's left
of a full aircraft.

747
00:42:13,801 --> 00:42:15,369
Probably going to
be a lot more bodies

748
00:42:15,504 --> 00:42:16,871
washing up soon.

749
00:42:17,004 --> 00:42:19,040
We were hoping supplies
would wash up as well.

750
00:42:19,173 --> 00:42:21,108
Yeah, well,
you'd be better off fishing...

751
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:23,077
during the day.

752
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,012
We suddenly
just figured that out.

753
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,654
How many more
of those things are out there?

754
00:42:34,488 --> 00:42:36,057
There's enough.

755
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,691
- Oh, shit! Come on.
- Come on. Come on.

756
00:42:39,093 --> 00:42:41,395
Oh, shit!

757
00:42:45,366 --> 00:42:48,135
Look out! Over there!

758
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:49,670
I got one!

759
00:42:49,804 --> 00:42:51,372
Let's see what you have!

760
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,910
You have anything fire?

761
00:42:56,944 --> 00:42:58,813
Mommy, he ate me.

762
00:42:58,946 --> 00:43:00,581
Wait. Hold up.

763
00:43:01,282 --> 00:43:03,284
- Over there.
- Look out.

764
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:05,286
Keep firing. Keep firing.

765
00:43:28,075 --> 00:43:29,276
Run!

766
00:43:31,479 --> 00:43:32,613
Come on.

767
00:43:34,915 --> 00:43:36,617
Let go! I got you!

768
00:43:41,922 --> 00:43:43,791
Oh, shit. I go high, you go low.

769
00:43:43,924 --> 00:43:45,292
You already know.

770
00:44:06,013 --> 00:44:07,181
It's scared of us, look!

771
00:44:07,314 --> 00:44:09,216
Me and my brother
kicked your ass.

772
00:44:12,153 --> 00:44:14,589
Shit!

773
00:44:54,061 --> 00:44:55,429
This doesn't
look too good, bro.

774
00:44:55,564 --> 00:44:56,997
Oh, shit.

775
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,305
They don't like burning.

776
00:45:04,438 --> 00:45:05,839
Stay back, stay back.

777
00:45:21,188 --> 00:45:23,157
Where'd you come from?

778
00:45:23,658 --> 00:45:27,127
Those damn things just
took out half our group.

779
00:45:29,631 --> 00:45:30,898
Yeah.

780
00:45:31,932 --> 00:45:33,100
Yeah, they'll do that.

781
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,170
But didn't take
half your people.

782
00:45:36,571 --> 00:45:38,138
Not yet.

783
00:45:41,842 --> 00:45:43,911
Not friends of yours, are they?

784
00:45:45,312 --> 00:45:46,514
No.

785
00:45:46,648 --> 00:45:47,848
Killed my whole team

786
00:45:47,982 --> 00:45:49,883
on the very first day
we were here.

787
00:45:53,354 --> 00:45:55,557
-So this is your fault.
-My fault?

788
00:45:56,223 --> 00:45:57,758
You're the one that
took some of the group off

789
00:45:57,891 --> 00:46:00,327
- and got five of them killed.
- Look, we don't need

790
00:46:00,461 --> 00:46:02,129
any more fighting tonight,
all right?

791
00:46:02,263 --> 00:46:05,099
Man, to hell with this.

792
00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:07,868
Any of you guys
want to come with me,

793
00:46:08,002 --> 00:46:09,803
you can get up and come on.

794
00:46:09,937 --> 00:46:11,272
Or you can stay with him

795
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:13,807
and wind up dead.

796
00:46:14,174 --> 00:46:16,443
It's not a good idea
to split up the party.

797
00:46:16,578 --> 00:46:17,911
Did I ask you?

798
00:46:21,081 --> 00:46:23,217
-No.
-Good.

799
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:26,220
Come on, guys.

800
00:46:26,621 --> 00:46:27,888
I'm with you, boss.

801
00:46:30,759 --> 00:46:32,026
I'm with you. Vic.

802
00:46:32,993 --> 00:46:34,395
Wait. What?

803
00:46:35,029 --> 00:46:36,463
He's with the FBI.

804
00:46:36,598 --> 00:46:38,566
Seems like he knows
what he's doing.

805
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,933
As long as he doesn't have us

806
00:46:40,067 --> 00:46:41,536
running around
like headless chickens,

807
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,304
I'm gonna follow him, girl.

808
00:46:49,376 --> 00:46:52,012
-Wait, you can't be serious.
-Wait!

809
00:46:52,614 --> 00:46:53,947
Are you leaving us?

810
00:46:54,882 --> 00:46:56,116
Mags?

811
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,586
I just don't wanna
see anyone else die.

812
00:46:59,253 --> 00:47:02,222
Hey! We came here together,

813
00:47:02,356 --> 00:47:03,758
we're getting
out of here together.

814
00:47:03,891 --> 00:47:07,428
It's just-- It's not safe.
I have to.

815
00:47:12,701 --> 00:47:13,834
Where the hell are you going?

816
00:47:14,602 --> 00:47:18,372
Chance of survival seems
to be better with the FBI agent.

817
00:47:18,773 --> 00:47:20,407
I know we don't.

818
00:47:20,542 --> 00:47:22,777
-Good luck to you.
-Thanks, man.

819
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:23,944
-I'm rolling with them.
-No. No.

820
00:47:24,078 --> 00:47:25,379
What?

821
00:47:26,213 --> 00:47:27,515
Trust me.

822
00:47:28,982 --> 00:47:30,552
Well, fuck.

823
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:52,406
-Good morning.
-Hey.

824
00:47:52,906 --> 00:47:54,341
So, tell me...

825
00:47:55,643 --> 00:47:58,312
how much do you
really know about survival?

826
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,447
Um...

827
00:48:01,683 --> 00:48:02,883
Not much, really.

828
00:48:05,052 --> 00:48:06,621
All right, everybody, up.

829
00:48:08,823 --> 00:48:10,424
Come on, up.

830
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:17,464
So, I assume you all have...

831
00:48:18,332 --> 00:48:21,435
limited knowledge and experience
surviving in the wild.

832
00:48:23,971 --> 00:48:26,508
Well, I'm willing to teach you
if you're willing to learn.

833
00:48:26,974 --> 00:48:29,042
We have limited daylight hours.

834
00:48:29,176 --> 00:48:31,078
It starts to get dim,

835
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:32,913
those things get bolder.

836
00:48:33,615 --> 00:48:35,517
We have a lot to do
in a little time

837
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:37,719
if you all want to
make it through the night.

838
00:48:38,218 --> 00:48:40,588
So, we should
probably start with torches.

839
00:48:41,355 --> 00:48:45,392
These things fear fire.
Torches are priority number one.

840
00:48:45,527 --> 00:48:47,529
You always want
to have a couple on hand,

841
00:48:47,662 --> 00:48:49,129
in case it goes out.

842
00:49:07,181 --> 00:49:09,249
So, the sea is
fruitful and generous.

843
00:49:09,383 --> 00:49:11,985
She is also loaded with sharks.

844
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:14,254
So, we try to keep this
in the shallows.

845
00:49:14,388 --> 00:49:16,658
So the idea is
we create an inland.

846
00:49:17,224 --> 00:49:18,492
Tide moves in, traps the fishes,

847
00:49:18,626 --> 00:49:21,195
-it moves out.
-How long does that take?

848
00:49:21,328 --> 00:49:23,197
Check back later today.

849
00:49:23,932 --> 00:49:25,533
Tomorrow morning at the latest.

850
00:49:27,201 --> 00:49:28,803
And I think it's best

851
00:49:29,671 --> 00:49:31,573
we keep these
burning at all times.

852
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,642
So make extra.

853
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:47,054
What we're going to be doing
is making fish traps.

854
00:49:47,187 --> 00:49:48,155
Pretty simple concept.

855
00:49:48,288 --> 00:49:49,490
What we're gonna do is

856
00:49:49,624 --> 00:49:51,058
we're going to
take these rocks...

857
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:53,561
We're going to put them around
just like this.

858
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:59,132
Until we have one
small opening for a high tide

859
00:49:59,266 --> 00:50:01,201
so the fish can
come and swim in.

860
00:50:02,302 --> 00:50:04,772
Once the water goes down
and low tide comes...

861
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:07,675
we'll have fish.

862
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:11,445
Greatest danger
during the day is the sun,

863
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:13,848
so we need to build
some kind of shelter.

864
00:50:16,985 --> 00:50:18,686
Good. Good. There.

865
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:20,354
You can build it
as big as you like,

866
00:50:20,487 --> 00:50:22,724
but usually the smaller it is,
the more stable.

867
00:50:24,057 --> 00:50:25,560
Good. It's good.

868
00:50:26,995 --> 00:50:28,462
Got it. Good.

869
00:50:31,031 --> 00:50:32,165
All right, well...

870
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,167
let's get these torches up.

871
00:50:38,071 --> 00:50:40,207
This guy is a godsend.

872
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,809
You're right about that.

873
00:50:42,276 --> 00:50:43,678
We're so lucky.

874
00:50:44,812 --> 00:50:45,880
Hey.

875
00:50:47,214 --> 00:50:48,482
Come with me.

876
00:50:50,117 --> 00:50:51,519
-Come on.
-Okay.

877
00:51:44,304 --> 00:51:46,040
Isn't it beautiful?

878
00:51:46,608 --> 00:51:49,343
I found it when I was
looking for supplies earlier.

879
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,514
You're beautiful.

880
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:25,073
You guys having fun out there?

881
00:53:25,606 --> 00:53:27,307
I just figured if
you guys were done,

882
00:53:27,441 --> 00:53:29,911
maybe I could, uh, take over.

883
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:39,554
There's not a chance.
Why don't you beat it?

884
00:53:40,188 --> 00:53:42,523
Now, that's not nice.

885
00:53:43,591 --> 00:53:45,660
You want to learn how
to survive on this island,

886
00:53:45,793 --> 00:53:49,664
you need to learn how to share.

887
00:53:54,501 --> 00:53:57,071
Is that all you got?

888
00:54:23,263 --> 00:54:24,431
Where do you think you're going?

889
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:34,474
You fully have no idea.

890
00:54:38,613 --> 00:54:41,348
Get up, pretty boy.

891
00:55:15,382 --> 00:55:16,884
Come on.

892
00:56:16,878 --> 00:56:18,679
Oh, shit.

893
00:56:22,415 --> 00:56:23,818
Where the hell am I?

894
00:56:59,153 --> 00:57:00,354
Fucking bitch.

895
00:58:26,607 --> 00:58:28,709
I'm so sorry.

896
00:58:31,712 --> 00:58:33,547
It's not my fault.

897
00:58:59,373 --> 00:59:01,642
Is this what you want?

898
00:59:02,376 --> 00:59:05,546
Is this what you want?

899
00:59:06,113 --> 00:59:09,016
Did you kill my baby?

900
00:59:10,418 --> 00:59:12,353
Did you kill my Amber?

901
00:59:33,207 --> 00:59:34,642
Come on.

902
00:59:35,042 --> 00:59:36,210
Let's see what you could do

903
00:59:36,343 --> 00:59:38,279
when someone's
actually facing you.

904
00:59:47,556 --> 00:59:49,890
You're not so tough now,
are you?

905
01:00:25,759 --> 01:00:27,194
Maybe we could try again.

906
01:00:27,328 --> 01:00:28,963
I'm sure there are plenty
of other waterfalls around.

907
01:00:29,096 --> 01:00:31,198
Where'd you two sneak off to?

908
01:00:33,767 --> 01:00:35,636
It's all right. Hey.

909
01:00:36,605 --> 01:00:39,373
Y'all come with me.
I'd like to show you something.

910
01:00:39,508 --> 01:00:41,408
Where are you taking us?

911
01:00:42,409 --> 01:00:43,644
Home.

912
01:00:57,124 --> 01:00:59,193
Got a lot of rainwater
if you're thirsty.

913
01:01:01,162 --> 01:01:03,430
Hell, I even have
a little rum if it suits you.

914
01:01:17,546 --> 01:01:19,079
So, um...

915
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,650
what's your story, Bruce?

916
01:01:22,416 --> 01:01:24,218
I was out running maneuvers
with my crew

917
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:26,655
and out of nowhere,
our tech went haywire

918
01:01:26,787 --> 01:01:28,189
and we went down.

919
01:01:28,822 --> 01:01:29,990
We were in
the water for three days

920
01:01:30,124 --> 01:01:31,892
before we washed up
on the island.

921
01:01:32,426 --> 01:01:34,495
They all got picked off
on the first night.

922
01:01:36,598 --> 01:01:37,698
Then, I was alone.

923
01:01:38,132 --> 01:01:40,000
It must have been hard on you.

924
01:01:42,403 --> 01:01:44,271
Yeah. At first.

925
01:01:46,207 --> 01:01:48,409
Time is a funny thing, you know.

926
01:01:49,544 --> 01:01:53,280
I put marks in trees at first
to count the days.

927
01:01:54,014 --> 01:01:56,183
Forget a few times,
then why bother?

928
01:01:58,252 --> 01:02:01,590
After that, all the days
just run together.

929
01:02:01,722 --> 01:02:04,158
The nights,
they just bleed in, bleed out,

930
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:06,093
bleed in, bleed out.

931
01:02:07,962 --> 01:02:09,396
You lose track.

932
01:02:11,832 --> 01:02:13,000
After I figured out

933
01:02:13,133 --> 01:02:14,268
the creatures
are afraid of fire,

934
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:16,070
survival wasn't too difficult.

935
01:02:17,071 --> 01:02:19,473
I just wanted to
keep an extra torch lit.

936
01:02:20,642 --> 01:02:23,578
Oh, but Christ,
I do miss the world.

937
01:02:24,078 --> 01:02:25,879
Anybody back home?

938
01:02:26,548 --> 01:02:28,683
Yeah.

939
01:02:28,816 --> 01:02:30,217
Sure do.

940
01:02:31,185 --> 01:02:33,854
My wife, Sally. My boy, Steven.

941
01:02:39,893 --> 01:02:41,529
They're beautiful.

942
01:02:45,634 --> 01:02:47,868
Bruce, uh...

943
01:02:49,036 --> 01:02:50,871
which war were you in?

944
01:02:51,905 --> 01:02:53,874
What do you mean, which war?

945
01:02:54,942 --> 01:02:56,578
The war.

946
01:02:57,679 --> 01:02:59,213
The Great War.

947
01:03:00,981 --> 01:03:02,349
What?

948
01:03:04,753 --> 01:03:06,120
Oh, your accident.

949
01:03:06,253 --> 01:03:08,590
What was the date?

950
01:03:09,189 --> 01:03:10,858
September 19th.

951
01:03:10,991 --> 01:03:12,326
Uh, no, the year.

952
01:03:14,361 --> 01:03:16,230
1917.

953
01:03:19,601 --> 01:03:21,235
What?

954
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:23,203
Our accident, Bruce.

955
01:03:23,337 --> 01:03:26,807
May 16th, 2022.

956
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:30,578
The War ended,
like, 100 years ago.

957
01:03:33,013 --> 01:03:35,916
-He's right.
-You're fucking with me.

958
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:38,185
No, I'm not.

959
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:40,622
Well, it doesn't
make sense, it's...

960
01:03:43,792 --> 01:03:45,125
Here.

961
01:03:45,727 --> 01:03:46,994
Take a look.

962
01:03:47,696 --> 01:03:49,063
It's my driver's license.

963
01:03:49,196 --> 01:03:51,298
-Here.
-Oh.

964
01:03:52,734 --> 01:03:54,636
I was born in 1992.

965
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,609
I don't understand.

966
01:04:03,877 --> 01:04:05,379
I don't-- I don't--

967
01:04:13,788 --> 01:04:16,558
That would mean my wife...

968
01:04:20,795 --> 01:04:23,197
-my boy.
-I'm sorry.

969
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:28,435
Did we win?

970
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:31,205
What?

971
01:04:33,474 --> 01:04:34,542
The war.

972
01:04:35,643 --> 01:04:36,778
Did we win?

973
01:04:37,144 --> 01:04:38,445
Yeah.

974
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:40,347
We won.

975
01:04:50,491 --> 01:04:51,593
Good.

976
01:04:53,293 --> 01:04:54,529
That's good.

977
01:04:54,662 --> 01:04:55,963
Why don't you all
head back to the beach?

978
01:04:56,096 --> 01:04:57,532
And I'll, uh...

979
01:04:58,031 --> 01:04:59,466
catch up with you later.

980
01:05:00,467 --> 01:05:01,536
Bruce.

981
01:05:01,669 --> 01:05:03,270
All right. Come on.

982
01:05:04,739 --> 01:05:06,206
I think I know a way, okay?

983
01:05:07,141 --> 01:05:08,710
Let's give him some time.

984
01:05:13,748 --> 01:05:15,215
-Damon?
-Yeah.

985
01:05:36,838 --> 01:05:38,807
I don't think
we're gonna see Bruce

986
01:05:38,939 --> 01:05:40,307
for a few days.

987
01:05:41,241 --> 01:05:42,710
Yeah, I know.

988
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:45,045
Could you imagine
being told that?

989
01:05:46,013 --> 01:05:47,615
Not in a million years.

990
01:05:47,749 --> 01:05:49,517
How is he still so young?

991
01:05:50,217 --> 01:05:52,386
How is he over 100 years old?

992
01:05:52,754 --> 01:05:55,055
Honestly,
none of this makes sense.

993
01:05:56,256 --> 01:05:57,625
The triangle.

994
01:05:58,660 --> 01:05:59,960
It's real.

995
01:06:00,093 --> 01:06:01,696
Real as in?

996
01:06:02,797 --> 01:06:06,099
The disappearance of boats,
ships and planes.

997
01:06:06,534 --> 01:06:10,003
They enter the Bermuda Triangle
and then boom, they're gone.

998
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:13,440
They just vanish
into nothingness.

999
01:06:14,308 --> 01:06:15,743
Maybe this is where they end up.

1000
01:06:17,344 --> 01:06:19,413
And what science
makes sense for that?

1001
01:06:19,781 --> 01:06:22,049
I don't know.
I mean, maybe it's, uh...

1002
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:24,451
reality warping or...

1003
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:28,623
another dimension.
I-- I have no clue.

1004
01:06:30,525 --> 01:06:32,594
Yeah, well,
how do we get out of here?

1005
01:06:33,026 --> 01:06:34,027
You don't.

1006
01:06:44,706 --> 01:06:46,875
Apparently,
I have been stuck here

1007
01:06:47,007 --> 01:06:48,710
for over 100 years.

1008
01:06:50,778 --> 01:06:54,248
It's just like
one big, goddamn circle.

1009
01:06:55,048 --> 01:06:56,350
Well, the way I see it,

1010
01:06:57,050 --> 01:07:00,989
if we found a way in,
we can find a way out.

1011
01:07:01,121 --> 01:07:02,189
Yeah.

1012
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:05,660
But first, we gotta survive.

1013
01:07:17,037 --> 01:07:18,238
Wake up!

1014
01:07:30,484 --> 01:07:33,153
- I'm okay.
- Stay with us.

1015
01:07:33,287 --> 01:07:35,289
It's gonna be okay.

1016
01:07:46,768 --> 01:07:49,037
Hey. How is she?

1017
01:07:49,537 --> 01:07:53,407
I don't know, Damon.
I'm not a fucking doctor.

1018
01:07:57,144 --> 01:07:59,146
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1019
01:07:59,814 --> 01:08:01,549
I don't know if
she's going to make it.

1020
01:08:01,983 --> 01:08:04,318
Her injuries might be
too severe to save her.

1021
01:08:05,053 --> 01:08:06,754
I understand but...

1022
01:08:07,589 --> 01:08:09,624
right now,
I'm trying to save all of us.

1023
01:08:11,025 --> 01:08:12,961
Come on. We have a plan.

1024
01:08:13,661 --> 01:08:15,830
Can't you tell me here?
We shouldn't leave her.

1025
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:18,600
It won't take long, I promise.

1026
01:08:18,733 --> 01:08:19,767
Okay.

1027
01:08:29,476 --> 01:08:31,512
You really think
this is a good idea?

1028
01:08:31,646 --> 01:08:33,380
It's the best one we've got.

1029
01:08:35,482 --> 01:08:37,885
I can teach you
what you need to know.

1030
01:08:38,251 --> 01:08:39,854
But this is do or die.

1031
01:08:40,521 --> 01:08:42,489
All right?
There's no contingency.

1032
01:08:42,624 --> 01:08:44,826
There's no fallback option.

1033
01:08:44,959 --> 01:08:46,628
There's no cavalry.

1034
01:08:46,761 --> 01:08:49,296
It's us and them.

1035
01:08:49,664 --> 01:08:52,900
Yeah, dozens and dozens of them.

1036
01:08:53,367 --> 01:08:56,104
Maybe hundreds?
- No.

1037
01:08:56,236 --> 01:08:57,304
I've been
around them long enough

1038
01:08:57,437 --> 01:08:59,040
to get a general head count.

1039
01:08:59,172 --> 01:09:01,075
They're a tribal species.

1040
01:09:01,576 --> 01:09:03,477
Pack hunters like wolves.

1041
01:09:04,344 --> 01:09:05,546
But I'll warn you...

1042
01:09:06,246 --> 01:09:08,883
there is an alpha.

1043
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:14,421
A pack leader, and he will
be the hardest to kill by far.

1044
01:09:17,992 --> 01:09:19,661
But total?

1045
01:09:20,394 --> 01:09:22,730
Maybe two dozen.

1046
01:09:23,898 --> 01:09:25,198
Maybe.

1047
01:09:27,501 --> 01:09:28,736
There's a few weapons

1048
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:30,170
you'll have to
get comfortable with.

1049
01:09:30,303 --> 01:09:32,305
Spear, bow and arrow.

1050
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:34,676
A spear can be thrown,

1051
01:09:35,777 --> 01:09:39,514
but works great for
close-quarters combat.

1052
01:09:41,015 --> 01:09:44,451
It's the monsters,
you got to get close,

1053
01:09:44,952 --> 01:09:48,556
'cause they've got teeth
and they've got claws.

1054
01:09:49,057 --> 01:09:50,858
And the spear

1055
01:09:53,326 --> 01:09:55,495
will help keep that distance.

1056
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:57,497
Let's go through it again.

1057
01:10:08,475 --> 01:10:10,343
You have got to be kidding me.

1058
01:10:10,477 --> 01:10:12,212
Wrong.

1059
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:15,683
close-quarters combat.

1060
01:10:53,253 --> 01:10:54,254
Oh.

1061
01:10:56,224 --> 01:10:57,759
It's uh...

1062
01:10:58,258 --> 01:10:59,627
it's two fingers.

1063
01:11:03,564 --> 01:11:06,701
Oh, hell yeah, Carolyn.
That was awesome.

1064
01:11:08,335 --> 01:11:10,437
I threw javelin in college.

1065
01:11:12,106 --> 01:11:13,207
I gotta check on Dakota.

1066
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:14,675
Okay.

1067
01:11:17,377 --> 01:11:20,181
So, I'm thinking next, we'll
work on forging some weapons.

1068
01:11:20,548 --> 01:11:21,883
There's plenty
of materials out here

1069
01:11:22,016 --> 01:11:24,018
on this island we can use
to put some together.

1070
01:11:24,152 --> 01:11:25,987
Bows and arrows, spears.

1071
01:11:26,687 --> 01:11:28,156
We can even use
them for hunting.

1072
01:11:28,288 --> 01:11:31,358
And what about for silencing
overpromising assholes?

1073
01:11:31,926 --> 01:11:34,729
I'm sorry, what was that?

1074
01:11:34,862 --> 01:11:38,966
Oh, our great leader,
the honorable FBI agent,

1075
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:40,535
he's a con.

1076
01:11:40,668 --> 01:11:42,670
He's been lying
to us the whole time.

1077
01:11:42,804 --> 01:11:44,739
If it hadn't been
for him following Damon

1078
01:11:44,872 --> 01:11:47,508
and the rest of the group,
we'd probably be dead by now.

1079
01:11:47,642 --> 01:11:50,511
-What's she talking about?
-Man, look at her.

1080
01:11:50,645 --> 01:11:52,680
- She's confused.
- No.

1081
01:11:52,814 --> 01:11:55,616
Every single thing
you have done,

1082
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:57,785
you stole from that vet
in the other group.

1083
01:11:58,286 --> 01:11:59,720
Is that true, Vic?

1084
01:12:00,087 --> 01:12:02,023
What does it matter
where I got it from?

1085
01:12:02,455 --> 01:12:04,192
Because that
was the whole point.

1086
01:12:04,324 --> 01:12:06,761
You were supposed to
be this superior leader.

1087
01:12:06,894 --> 01:12:08,729
Your knowledge
and expertise were supposed

1088
01:12:08,863 --> 01:12:11,732
to save us
and get us off this island.

1089
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:35,823
I'm a liar.

1090
01:12:37,058 --> 01:12:39,660
You're alive, aren't you?
You could have left.

1091
01:12:40,261 --> 01:12:42,230
I never told you
I was a survivalist.

1092
01:12:42,362 --> 01:12:43,798
I never said follow me.

1093
01:12:43,931 --> 01:12:46,701
That's just your own damn fault.
You assumed.

1094
01:12:47,969 --> 01:12:50,271
-Hey, captain.
-Yeah?

1095
01:12:52,173 --> 01:12:53,274
Mutiny.

1096
01:12:54,242 --> 01:12:55,408
Mutiny.

1097
01:12:56,043 --> 01:12:58,913
For your crimes
of lying, misleading.

1098
01:13:00,748 --> 01:13:03,317
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1099
01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:04,552
What were you saying?

1100
01:13:04,685 --> 01:13:05,753
We never should
have trusted you,

1101
01:13:05,887 --> 01:13:07,521
you piece of shit.

1102
01:13:09,523 --> 01:13:10,825
What is he doing?

1103
01:13:11,993 --> 01:13:13,694
What was that about a mutiny?

1104
01:13:18,733 --> 01:13:21,135
I said I would do anything

1105
01:13:21,736 --> 01:13:23,571
to get us all out of this alive.

1106
01:13:25,106 --> 01:13:28,242
I guess that was
everybody but you.

1107
01:13:40,521 --> 01:13:41,856
It's my fault.

1108
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:43,591
How?

1109
01:13:43,724 --> 01:13:45,693
I forgot to make
sure the torch was lit.

1110
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,362
I mean, it's an honest mistake.

1111
01:13:48,863 --> 01:13:51,098
You don't get
the big picture, do you?

1112
01:13:51,232 --> 01:13:52,767
-We've got a plan--
-Do you really want to

1113
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,035
spend the rest of your life here

1114
01:13:54,168 --> 01:13:55,336
worrying about
having a fire lit?

1115
01:13:56,103 --> 01:13:58,606
And what happens
if the oil runs out?

1116
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:02,276
You're putting
a whole lot of faith

1117
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:03,811
in this plan of his.

1118
01:14:04,378 --> 01:14:06,147
And what if it doesn't work out?

1119
01:14:07,181 --> 01:14:08,649
Then what?

1120
01:14:09,617 --> 01:14:11,085
Then we die.

1121
01:14:13,688 --> 01:14:15,256
This is it.

1122
01:14:16,456 --> 01:14:18,292
Either we kill them all...

1123
01:14:19,393 --> 01:14:20,460
or we die.

1124
01:14:21,162 --> 01:14:23,931
God, I'm such an idiot.

1125
01:14:24,565 --> 01:14:26,267
Almost there.

1126
01:14:36,177 --> 01:14:38,312
Ah, Jesus.

1127
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:54,195
Jimmy, I'm getting
really tired--

1128
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:05,006
I hope you get food poisoning.

1129
01:15:10,711 --> 01:15:12,613
The monsters holed up here.

1130
01:15:12,747 --> 01:15:14,148
This is all open beach,

1131
01:15:14,582 --> 01:15:16,417
so they won't have
anywhere to go but the ocean.

1132
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:18,953
They're not as afraid
of that as they are of the fire.

1133
01:15:19,887 --> 01:15:21,689
We have a preset
booby trap waiting for them

1134
01:15:21,822 --> 01:15:23,391
with the oil encircling them.

1135
01:15:23,524 --> 01:15:25,926
Once we get them in there,
we just need someone to come up

1136
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:27,428
the back where they came in,

1137
01:15:27,561 --> 01:15:28,863
close off the circle.

1138
01:15:29,497 --> 01:15:32,733
After that, it's pretty
much just target practice.

1139
01:15:32,867 --> 01:15:35,770
So, how do we head them
into the trap space?

1140
01:15:38,939 --> 01:15:40,641
We're going to need bait.

1141
01:15:40,775 --> 01:15:42,009
What kind of--

1142
01:15:42,143 --> 01:15:44,478
Oh, my God.

1143
01:15:45,379 --> 01:15:47,681
- You son of a bitch.
- Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1144
01:15:47,815 --> 01:15:49,850
Go ahead, sweetheart.

1145
01:15:49,984 --> 01:15:51,285
Just give me a reason.

1146
01:15:52,353 --> 01:15:54,388
Where's Frank?

1147
01:15:56,424 --> 01:15:59,093
- No.
- Both of them traitors.

1148
01:15:59,226 --> 01:16:00,394
Frank...

1149
01:16:00,529 --> 01:16:02,663
and this little bitch.

1150
01:16:02,797 --> 01:16:04,198
Fuck you.

1151
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:07,268
What the fuck?

1152
01:16:07,968 --> 01:16:09,870
All right. All right.
What do you want?

1153
01:16:10,004 --> 01:16:12,873
I favored your plan.
Sounds good.

1154
01:16:15,042 --> 01:16:16,577
And you mentioned
something about bait?

1155
01:16:17,211 --> 01:16:20,247
Someone's gonna have to lead him
into the center of the circle.

1156
01:16:21,782 --> 01:16:23,984
Problem with that is that, uh--

1157
01:16:24,418 --> 01:16:25,753
Flames on one side...

1158
01:16:26,555 --> 01:16:27,621
creatures on the other.

1159
01:16:28,155 --> 01:16:30,658
- Exactly.
- I'll do it.

1160
01:16:30,791 --> 01:16:33,260
Jimmy, no.

1161
01:16:34,995 --> 01:16:37,231
Damon, let me do this.

1162
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:41,135
So touching.

1163
01:16:42,136 --> 01:16:43,270
So....

1164
01:16:43,704 --> 01:16:46,474
What's your plan on how we're
gonna get off this island?

1165
01:16:50,911 --> 01:16:52,913
First,
we need to set up the oil trap

1166
01:16:53,047 --> 01:16:54,215
from the outside.

1167
01:16:54,348 --> 01:16:55,616
Except the entrance, right?

1168
01:16:55,749 --> 01:16:57,051
That's right.

1169
01:16:57,952 --> 01:16:59,687
Somebody's gonna
have to come in from behind

1170
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:01,188
just to finish it off.

1171
01:17:01,556 --> 01:17:04,258
-They're gonna have to be fast.
-How fast?

1172
01:17:04,391 --> 01:17:05,860
Fast enough to get it
closed off,

1173
01:17:05,993 --> 01:17:08,195
but not so fast you
catch yourself on fire.

1174
01:17:08,329 --> 01:17:09,497
I'll do it.

1175
01:17:10,164 --> 01:17:11,999
I used to run track in college.

1176
01:17:12,766 --> 01:17:14,702
- I can handle it.
- All right.

1177
01:17:15,069 --> 01:17:16,470
I give you the signal,
you close it off.

1178
01:17:16,904 --> 01:17:19,273
Gonna have to be quick, though,
cause those fuckers are fast

1179
01:17:19,406 --> 01:17:20,374
when they wanna be.

1180
01:17:20,509 --> 01:17:22,009
You'll have seconds at best.

1181
01:17:22,443 --> 01:17:25,012
You have to make sure
you get them all in the circle.

1182
01:17:25,946 --> 01:17:29,483
All right? Blood, loud noises,
draw them out.

1183
01:17:30,117 --> 01:17:31,886
No fire anywhere near you.

1184
01:17:32,987 --> 01:17:34,421
Then Damon comes along...

1185
01:17:35,456 --> 01:17:36,857
closes off the circle.

1186
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:41,596
After that, we pick them off,
let them burn themselves up.

1187
01:17:42,496 --> 01:17:44,765
We have to make sure
we keep that fire going.

1188
01:17:46,667 --> 01:17:47,935
What if something goes wrong?

1189
01:17:49,837 --> 01:17:51,405
Well, then we'll deal with it.

1190
01:18:17,898 --> 01:18:19,634
Over here!

1191
01:18:39,688 --> 01:18:40,955
Go!

1192
01:18:41,088 --> 01:18:43,592
Jimmy!

1193
01:18:47,127 --> 01:18:48,395
Are you insane?

1194
01:18:55,769 --> 01:18:58,573
Where my plan starts
to differ from yours.

1195
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:48,956
You need to think about this.

1196
01:20:28,763 --> 01:20:32,634
Hey, I knew we couldn't
trust you!

1197
01:21:13,173 --> 01:21:15,175
-Mike!
-Go!

1198
01:21:15,677 --> 01:21:17,411
I can't.

1199
01:21:18,546 --> 01:21:20,180
Go.

1200
01:21:36,029 --> 01:21:37,498
What are you?

1201
01:21:38,533 --> 01:21:41,335
This is my island.

1202
01:21:41,468 --> 01:21:42,704
It looks like Paradise...

1203
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:47,441
...but we're as
far away from it as you can get.

1204
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:49,778
And I...

1205
01:21:50,244 --> 01:21:51,445
I am the closest thing

1206
01:21:51,579 --> 01:21:53,848
to the Devil that
you will find here.

1207
01:22:02,289 --> 01:22:03,591
Shit.

1208
01:22:45,299 --> 01:22:46,901
Eat well.

1209
01:22:47,702 --> 01:22:50,137
Who knows when
the next group is coming?
