1
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:03,655
Unfortunately,
I can't make this delivery myself.

2
00:02:05,907 --> 00:02:08,702
I have a reputation
with certain customs officials.

3
00:02:08,785 --> 00:02:10,453
But I'll be along later in the week.

4
00:02:10,537 --> 00:02:14,165
I don't think you'll have problems at all.
Not with Rasputin along.

5
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:28,221
The United States Government is trying
very hard to get its hand on these.

6
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:37,563
The most perfect plates ever created
for $100 bills.

7
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:16,161
I'm sorry, ma'am, they are not ready yet.

8
00:04:16,245 --> 00:04:19,790
Mr. O'Hanlon, you promised me
the shoes would be ready by tonight.

9
00:04:19,873 --> 00:04:22,793
I should have taken them
to a more reliable repairman.

10
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:26,171
That you should have, ma'am.
Because I'm not a shoe repairman.

11
00:04:26,255 --> 00:04:29,633
I'm a cobbler, an expert craftsman,
that cannot be rushed in his work.

12
00:04:29,716 --> 00:04:33,761
I came here because my granddaughter
insisted you needed the business.

13
00:04:33,844 --> 00:04:37,682
I need nothing from the likes of you,
especially it being so close to Christmas.

14
00:04:37,765 --> 00:04:40,476
- Give me my shoes back.
- Take them and be gone.

15
00:04:40,643 --> 00:04:42,103
Come on, Lisa.

16
00:04:42,853 --> 00:04:44,355
Wait, Grandma.

17
00:04:49,568 --> 00:04:52,613
I can't hear. I can't hear anything.

18
00:04:52,738 --> 00:04:55,157
- No tricks tonight, Lisa.
- What?

19
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:58,494
I can't hear you. Really.

20
00:05:00,496 --> 00:05:02,373
All right. Let's have a look.

21
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:07,503
No wonder you couldn't hear anything.
You had a coin in your ear.

22
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:10,881
Go on with you.
And keep that money out of your ear.

23
00:05:12,174 --> 00:05:14,677
- Good night, Pat.
- Good night, my darling.

24
00:05:16,845 --> 00:05:19,014
A shoe repairman indeed.

25
00:05:53,131 --> 00:05:54,925
What're you doing?

26
00:05:55,008 --> 00:05:58,553
No, I'm not going in there.
No! I'm not getting in there.

27
00:06:01,348 --> 00:06:02,349
Let's go.

28
00:06:07,312 --> 00:06:10,315
It's a poor cobbler you're kidnapping.
Don't you know that?

29
00:06:10,398 --> 00:06:12,859
Who's kidnapping?
All we want is your gold.

30
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:15,445
Gold? I haven't got any gold.

31
00:06:16,404 --> 00:06:19,574
- A friend of ours told us differently.
- Who might that be?

32
00:06:19,658 --> 00:06:22,786
Just hang on, my lad.
You'll be finding out soon enough.

33
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,790
That's not bad.
You ought to try out for The Gong Show.

34
00:06:31,878 --> 00:06:33,046
What the...

35
00:06:36,716 --> 00:06:39,552
- He's disappeared.
- He's gone. I don't believe it.

36
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,847
- Where did he go?
- How do I know?

37
00:06:56,277 --> 00:07:00,156
United British Airways
flight number seven from New York...

38
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:03,743
is now arriving at gate number 22.

39
00:07:07,622 --> 00:07:09,290
Passenger Richard Alexander...

40
00:07:09,374 --> 00:07:10,666
Flight to Washington.

41
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,085
...Richard Alexander...

42
00:07:12,168 --> 00:07:15,963
please report to New Continental Airlines
flight desk.

43
00:07:20,927 --> 00:07:24,931
Last call for Trans European
flight number 10...

44
00:07:25,097 --> 00:07:28,392
now boarding at gate number 16.

45
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,152
American International flight number four
from San Francisco...

46
00:07:39,737 --> 00:07:43,824
is now arriving at gate number 31.

47
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,041
United British Airways flight number...

48
00:08:55,228 --> 00:08:57,397
Your travels are over, Charlie.

49
00:09:07,282 --> 00:09:09,785
- Where are the plates?
- They're on the dog.

50
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,704
In the vest.
But you are too late, Wonder Woman.

51
00:09:30,512 --> 00:09:33,390
I can't believe some runt of an old man
got the best of you.

52
00:09:33,474 --> 00:09:35,267
We can't believe it either, Mr. Bonelli.

53
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:37,186
He just disappeared.

54
00:09:37,353 --> 00:09:38,729
The next time...

55
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,856
you better be more careful. Got that?

56
00:09:40,939 --> 00:09:43,442
Listen, why don't we
forget about O'Hanlon?

57
00:09:43,525 --> 00:09:45,694
He's just a poor old shoemaker anyway.

58
00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:48,614
That poor old shoemaker
has got a hoard of gold somewhere.

59
00:09:48,697 --> 00:09:51,909
And I need all the gold I can get
to buy those counterfeit plates.

60
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:54,161
$1,500,000 worth.

61
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,460
We've only got until Wednesday.

62
00:10:01,752 --> 00:10:04,296
If we blow this deal with Thackery...

63
00:10:04,796 --> 00:10:07,466
we'll all gonna be getting funerals
for Christmas.

64
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:10,052
Okay. So what do you want us
to do about it?

65
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:13,472
We hit O'Hanlon again.
And this time we make it good.

66
00:10:15,474 --> 00:10:16,725
In two days...

67
00:10:16,808 --> 00:10:20,729
I'm gonna be the guy dishing out
the funerals, and making people sweat.

68
00:10:22,814 --> 00:10:25,650
No one's gonna stop me
from getting those plates.

69
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:29,112
Especially not some stupid old shoemaker.

70
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:20,204
Lisa, you gave me a fright.
You mustn't sneak up on me like that.

71
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:21,372
I'm sorry.

72
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:25,543
Is this a new game?

73
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:30,048
I've got to go away, darling.
There's some bad men who're after me.

74
00:11:30,131 --> 00:11:32,008
Do they want your gold?

75
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,015
You're never to mention my gold again.
You hear me?

76
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,141
You had no business...

77
00:11:40,224 --> 00:11:42,477
peeking in the basement of my shop
like you did.

78
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,896
It was a mistake
you ever found out about my gold.

79
00:11:44,979 --> 00:11:48,232
I didn't mean to see it.
And I'm really sorry, Pat.

80
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:52,111
I want your solemn word
you'll never mention my gold again.

81
00:11:52,194 --> 00:11:55,406
I promised before.
I won't tell anyone. Ever.

82
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,909
All right, fine. Now, be gone.
I've got work to do.

83
00:12:03,873 --> 00:12:04,999
Hey, Pat...

84
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:09,086
- I can't hear anything.
- No, I have no time, Lisa.

85
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:13,799
- Aren't you gonna check my ears?
- Lisa, I don't have time.

86
00:12:21,432 --> 00:12:24,101
Okay. Goodbye, Pat.

87
00:12:37,948 --> 00:12:39,616
Lisa, darling.

88
00:12:48,876 --> 00:12:50,919
Thackery pulled a switch on me, Steve.

89
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:55,048
I caught up with Courier, but not before
he got the plates on the plane.

90
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:57,593
- What flight?
- Global Air, Flight 183.

91
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:00,762
Arrives in Washington at 10:25 a. m.

92
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,806
183, we'll be there.

93
00:13:03,473 --> 00:13:06,935
Yeah, there's one more thing, Steve.
The plates are on a dog.

94
00:13:07,603 --> 00:13:08,854
On a...

95
00:13:09,271 --> 00:13:10,397
A dog?

96
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:13,358
One of Thackery's attack dogs.

97
00:14:14,586 --> 00:14:16,462
Easy, boy, easy now.

98
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:40,485
Seal off all the exits.

99
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:35,206
Mr. Bonelli, I presume?

100
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,126
That's right.
Welcome to Washington, Mr. Thackery.

101
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,712
This really is a nifty idea.

102
00:15:40,795 --> 00:15:44,173
It doesn't do to be too far from
one's point of departure.

103
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:48,678
Good thinking. The boys and I have taken
accommodation just down the road.

104
00:15:52,306 --> 00:15:53,391
Nice.

105
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:56,978
- His Majesty's Light Horse Brigade.
- I saw the movie.

106
00:15:57,437 --> 00:15:59,897
Cannons to the right. Cannons to the left.

107
00:16:00,898 --> 00:16:02,316
You collect these?

108
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:04,610
In a manner of speaking.

109
00:16:04,694 --> 00:16:07,822
Only, when mine reach London
they won't be lead...

110
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:09,991
they'll be gold.

111
00:16:11,492 --> 00:16:12,910
I get it.

112
00:16:14,203 --> 00:16:18,624
You're gonna melt the gold down,
and pass it through as toy soldiers.

113
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:19,834
That's fantastic.

114
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:21,335
Mr. Bonelli...

115
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:25,256
they told me in London
that you weren't a really big operator.

116
00:16:25,381 --> 00:16:28,843
You had no leverage, you couldn't handle
a really big job. True?

117
00:16:28,926 --> 00:16:32,638
Let's wait and see how this operation
works out first. Okay, Mr. Thackery?

118
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:36,183
You want the gold and I want the plates.
It's that simple.

119
00:16:36,267 --> 00:16:38,727
We're to meet Wednesday
for the exchange.

120
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,730
The quicker this business is over,
the better for me.

121
00:16:41,814 --> 00:16:45,401
There is one thing, though.
I need another 24 hours.

122
00:16:45,484 --> 00:16:49,154
It would make things a lot easier
if we can deliver it on Thursday.

123
00:16:51,782 --> 00:16:54,535
Are you saying you don't have the gold?

124
00:16:54,618 --> 00:16:56,287
No. I have access to it.

125
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:00,040
It's just that it'd make things easier
if I can deliver it on Thursday.

126
00:17:00,124 --> 00:17:02,710
Mr. Bonelli,
as these gentlemen will attest...

127
00:17:02,793 --> 00:17:05,963
I've gone to great risk
in coming to this country.

128
00:17:06,046 --> 00:17:09,049
I didn't do so to be lied to
or trifled with.

129
00:17:09,842 --> 00:17:12,845
You've got it all wrong, Mr. Thackery.
Everything's ready.

130
00:17:12,928 --> 00:17:15,097
Wednesday, Mr. Bonelli.

131
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:19,142
Okay. You've got it. Wednesday.

132
00:17:20,185 --> 00:17:22,062
Very good.

133
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:27,901
Hush and be done with you.
"Where're my shoes, Mr. O'Hanlon?

134
00:17:27,985 --> 00:17:30,404
"Why aren't you working today,
Mr. O'Hanlon?

135
00:17:30,487 --> 00:17:33,365
"An irresponsible old man,
that's what you are, Mr. O'Hanlon. "

136
00:17:33,448 --> 00:17:35,993
I can't stand here
listening to that sound any longer.

137
00:17:36,076 --> 00:17:38,078
I won't be caged up with that.

138
00:17:41,498 --> 00:17:43,166
Going somewhere, Mr. O'Hanlon?

139
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,211
First, it's kidnapping.
Now it's breaking and entering, is it?

140
00:17:46,294 --> 00:17:48,922
You'll be getting coal in your stockings
this Christmas.

141
00:17:49,005 --> 00:17:50,507
Your gold, old man.

142
00:17:51,675 --> 00:17:53,802
Send help here right away, please.

143
00:17:54,427 --> 00:17:57,639
Like he said, the gold, old man.

144
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:02,352
Why do you think I've got any gold?

145
00:18:03,353 --> 00:18:05,939
We hit a very prominent
gold exchange outfit.

146
00:18:06,606 --> 00:18:09,776
And your name,
followed by several five-digit numbers...

147
00:18:10,318 --> 00:18:12,612
was on their preferred-customers list.

148
00:18:12,696 --> 00:18:15,490
You can't have my gold.
You'll have to take my life first.

149
00:18:15,573 --> 00:18:18,618
Maxwell, take him in the back
and use the silencer.

150
00:18:18,702 --> 00:18:20,995
And you, start tearing this place apart.

151
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,455
No, wait.

152
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,292
I'll take you to the gold.

153
00:18:26,376 --> 00:18:27,794
No tricks, old man.

154
00:18:28,294 --> 00:18:30,797
I'm not taking my eyes,
or this gun, off you...

155
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,632
till we see that gold.

156
00:18:33,258 --> 00:18:36,010
No tricks. It's at my shop.
In the basement.

157
00:19:08,751 --> 00:19:11,671
Jackpot. Okay, gentlemen, bring it up.

158
00:19:16,092 --> 00:19:18,678
I never look a gift horse in the mouth,
old man.

159
00:19:18,761 --> 00:19:22,682
That's why I'm not gonna ask you
how in the world you acquired all this.

160
00:19:23,015 --> 00:19:25,351
Or why in the world you haven't spent it?

161
00:19:25,434 --> 00:19:26,936
Let's go. Bring it up.

162
00:19:34,776 --> 00:19:37,862
We'll take this upstairs
and wait for you, Mr. B.

163
00:19:38,196 --> 00:19:40,490
Please. Can I get out of here now, too?

164
00:19:41,616 --> 00:19:44,536
What's the matter, old man?
Don't you like my company?

165
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:46,579
It's the basement I don't like.

166
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:50,208
Dark and secluded places
never did sit well with me.

167
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:52,043
That's just too bad.

168
00:19:53,002 --> 00:19:56,214
Because I don't know
what else I can do with you...

169
00:19:57,715 --> 00:19:59,259
except leave you down here.

170
00:19:59,342 --> 00:20:01,386
Please, Mr. Bonelli, don't do that.

171
00:20:01,469 --> 00:20:04,430
Use your gun, anything,
but please don't lock me up.

172
00:20:54,105 --> 00:20:56,107
- I'm back.
- You look beat.

173
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,983
I know. I am.

174
00:20:59,109 --> 00:21:01,111
I'll never make a jet setter, Steve.

175
00:21:01,195 --> 00:21:03,051
What's the latest on Thackery?

176
00:21:03,052 --> 00:21:04,907
Immigration says he's
still in the country.

177
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,284
I've got something
that's gonna lead us to him.

178
00:21:07,368 --> 00:21:09,328
- Great. What is it?
- Gold robberies...

179
00:21:09,411 --> 00:21:11,288
about a dozen of them in the past month...

180
00:21:11,372 --> 00:21:13,999
apparently done by
the same person or persons.

181
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,209
I get it.

182
00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:19,963
Thackery never negotiates for currency,
only precious metals or jewels.

183
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:23,592
Whoever's been stealing the gold
plans to buy the counterfeit plates.

184
00:21:23,676 --> 00:21:26,512
Find the gold thief,
chances are you'll find Thackery.

185
00:21:27,304 --> 00:21:29,014
It sounds good on paper, Steve...

186
00:21:29,098 --> 00:21:32,434
but do you think this person or persons
will try it again?

187
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,354
It's a long shot,
but we've arranged for a decoy.

188
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:38,607
A jewelry corporation is transferring
a small amount of gold...

189
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,733
this afternoon at 4:30.

190
00:21:39,816 --> 00:21:42,945
Our people made sure
the news got on the grapevine.

191
00:21:43,654 --> 00:21:45,697
Midland Security Transports.

192
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:57,668
What's a few more hours without sleep?

193
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,671
- Thanks.
- Welcome.

194
00:22:01,797 --> 00:22:03,382
- Have a good time.
- I will.

195
00:22:11,848 --> 00:22:15,852
Yeah, that's right. Like I said before
I want no foul-ups on your end.

196
00:22:19,481 --> 00:22:20,607
Yeah.

197
00:22:24,402 --> 00:22:25,528
Okay.

198
00:22:26,154 --> 00:22:27,614
Yeah. We got it.

199
00:22:28,198 --> 00:22:29,908
They're working a run as scheduled.

200
00:22:29,991 --> 00:22:32,702
- You got the uniforms?
- Yeah. But why the extra job?

201
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:35,789
I thought all we needed to pay Thackery
was the Irishman's gold.

202
00:22:35,872 --> 00:22:38,041
Deal with Thackery,
you've gotta be adaptable.

203
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:41,127
- Raucher, you ready?
- It'll be as good as the real thing, Mr. B.

204
00:22:41,211 --> 00:22:42,879
Figure it out for yourself, Maxwell.

205
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:46,216
In two weeks, tonight's gold
won't be worth what it was yesterday.

206
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:47,550
I don't get it.

207
00:22:47,842 --> 00:22:49,969
Thackery's discounting our gold.

208
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:53,139
You two guys get the doors, let's go.

209
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,437
As soon as you finish with that,
you better get changed.

210
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,232
You guys have got less than an hour.
Pick it up.

211
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:30,092
- Just can't get over it.
- What's that?

212
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:34,513
- A woman being an agent with the AIDC.
- It's the IADC.

213
00:23:34,597 --> 00:23:37,308
- What? You don't approve?
- Sure.

214
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:41,520
It's just gonna take some time
to get used to it.

215
00:23:41,604 --> 00:23:44,690
- Don't take too much time, Gino.
- Why not?

216
00:23:45,107 --> 00:23:47,234
You might get replaced. By a woman.

217
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:54,700
That's one of our trucks. We better stop.

218
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,416
- You have problem here?
- You do.

219
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:05,085
Hold it, sweetheart. Come on out.

220
00:24:12,301 --> 00:24:14,637
Right back there. Move.

221
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:23,062
Open the door.

222
00:24:25,481 --> 00:24:26,606
Let's go.

223
00:24:29,442 --> 00:24:30,943
Now get in.

224
00:24:42,455 --> 00:24:43,915
Okay, let's go.

225
00:24:51,464 --> 00:24:53,549
You're gonna do exactly as we say...

226
00:24:53,633 --> 00:24:57,094
or your family's gonna have
a very unmerry Christmas this year.

227
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:36,467
Thieves! They're stealing the gold!
Stop them!

228
00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:39,178
Halt!

229
00:25:41,138 --> 00:25:42,222
Come on!

230
00:25:55,194 --> 00:25:56,904
Now, back up.

231
00:26:11,084 --> 00:26:12,169
Move it!

232
00:26:16,048 --> 00:26:17,674
Come back.

233
00:27:30,705 --> 00:27:33,249
- He won't get out of the way.
- Run him down.

234
00:27:45,428 --> 00:27:48,931
- Are you all right?
- What did you do that for?

235
00:27:49,265 --> 00:27:52,768
- I just saved your life.
- You let them get away is what you did.

236
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,605
Interfering women.

237
00:28:00,318 --> 00:28:01,736
Thank you very much, miss.

238
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:02,862
- May I come in?
- No.

239
00:28:02,945 --> 00:28:04,196
Mr. O'Hanlon.

240
00:28:04,447 --> 00:28:08,492
Look, miss, I told the police
and Wonder Woman everything I know.

241
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:12,163
You didn't tell her what you were doing
in the back of that truck.

242
00:28:12,955 --> 00:28:16,792
I was going to rent the truck
and I accidentally locked myself in...

243
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:21,464
How would you know
what I told Wonder Woman?

244
00:28:21,547 --> 00:28:23,924
- Pat, you're back.
- Lisa, my darling.

245
00:28:24,258 --> 00:28:25,342
Hi.

246
00:28:25,593 --> 00:28:27,887
So, you know nothing about those men?

247
00:28:28,012 --> 00:28:31,265
- Like I said-
- Those men didn't catch you after all.

248
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,850
- What men?
- Well...

249
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:37,229
It's just a little game we play.
Isn't it, Lisa? Not now, darling.

250
00:28:37,813 --> 00:28:41,775
Yeah, Pat's right.
I was just playing our little game.

251
00:28:41,942 --> 00:28:45,029
Yeah. Listen, why don't you run along.
I'll talk to you later.

252
00:28:45,112 --> 00:28:47,281
Missy, thank you very much for the ride.

253
00:28:47,364 --> 00:28:48,907
- Yes.
- Goodbye.

254
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,785
Lisa, are you really good friends
with Pat?

255
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,690
Oh, yes.

256
00:28:58,167 --> 00:29:00,878
I like to think so.

257
00:29:01,462 --> 00:29:03,672
But I'm sometimes not sure about him.

258
00:29:05,174 --> 00:29:09,970
If you really care about him, you'll tell me
about those men who wanted to hurt him.

259
00:29:10,137 --> 00:29:11,638
But I promised not to.

260
00:29:11,722 --> 00:29:14,182
You don't want to see Pat get hurt,
do you?

261
00:29:14,516 --> 00:29:17,436
Are you a policeman?
I mean, policeperson?

262
00:29:18,895 --> 00:29:20,522
Well, sort of.

263
00:29:23,317 --> 00:29:25,402
Some men tried to take Pat's gold.

264
00:29:28,237 --> 00:29:30,781
- How much gold does he have?
- A lot.

265
00:29:31,198 --> 00:29:34,368
He has a big old-fashioned pot of it,
filled to the brim.

266
00:29:34,702 --> 00:29:36,620
I saw it by mistake once.

267
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,166
I shouldn't tell you this, but...

268
00:29:41,709 --> 00:29:45,296
I think Pat's a leprechaun.
They always have a pot of gold.

269
00:29:46,046 --> 00:29:47,464
A leprechaun?

270
00:29:48,173 --> 00:29:51,677
Forget it. I was just playing
another little dumb game.

271
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,391
You won't tell Pat I said that, will you?

272
00:29:57,474 --> 00:29:59,393
No, I won't say a thing.

273
00:29:59,643 --> 00:30:02,354
And I promise,
I won't let anyone hurt him, either.

274
00:30:02,604 --> 00:30:03,689
Okay?

275
00:30:13,365 --> 00:30:16,660
- Patrick O'Hanlon has a shoe shop where?
- Eighty-first.

276
00:30:16,785 --> 00:30:20,164
I'd like a full rundown on him
first thing in the morning, Ira.

277
00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:22,291
As you wish, Diana Prince.

278
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:25,878
- You think O'Hanlon's hiding something?
- Yeah.

279
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,797
- A pot of gold.
- A what?

280
00:30:29,256 --> 00:30:32,050
Steve, what do you know
about leprechauns?

281
00:30:32,134 --> 00:30:35,387
The wee people.
My grandmother told me all about them.

282
00:30:36,221 --> 00:30:38,056
It's an old Irish myth.

283
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:41,685
Magical little men
who've been given a pot of gold to guard.

284
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:44,187
Ifyou capture one,
he must give up his gold.

285
00:30:44,271 --> 00:30:46,690
And he has to get it back all by himself.

286
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:50,527
But if you take your eyes off him,
the leprechaun will disappear.

287
00:30:51,528 --> 00:30:52,821
Why do you ask?

288
00:30:52,988 --> 00:30:56,867
There's a little girl
who thinks that O'Hanlon's a leprechaun.

289
00:30:57,409 --> 00:30:58,660
Pure fantasy.

290
00:30:59,578 --> 00:31:03,206
As much fantasy, perhaps,
as Wonder Woman, Steve Trevor.

291
00:31:05,584 --> 00:31:06,710
Right.

292
00:31:10,505 --> 00:31:13,633
Gold's crated, all ready to roll,
Mr. Bonelli. But that old man-

293
00:31:13,717 --> 00:31:15,802
He must've hid in the truck
while we were here.

294
00:31:15,885 --> 00:31:19,013
- He knows where we are.
- I'm not worried about O'Hanlon.

295
00:31:19,264 --> 00:31:23,518
He's got something to hide or he would've
gone to the police long before this.

296
00:31:23,601 --> 00:31:26,980
But if he shows up again kill him.

297
00:33:47,494 --> 00:33:51,123
You just let us know where
you want the transaction to take place.

298
00:33:51,706 --> 00:33:53,083
Fine, we're on our way.

299
00:34:08,014 --> 00:34:10,559
All right, go on, back up, the both of you.

300
00:34:13,061 --> 00:34:16,481
- You're making one big mistake, O'Hanlon.
- Not me, boy-o.

301
00:34:16,606 --> 00:34:20,360
I'm not the one making the mistake,
you are, tangling with the likes of me.

302
00:34:20,443 --> 00:34:22,195
I'll just take what's mine and be gone.

303
00:34:22,278 --> 00:34:24,863
I don't think Mr. Raucher is going
to let you do that.

304
00:34:24,947 --> 00:34:26,824
Aren't you the sly one?

305
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:29,201
I'm not as big a fool as you think.

306
00:34:29,743 --> 00:34:31,036
I lost O'Hanlon.

307
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,498
One minute his car was right in front
of me, the next minute it was gone.

308
00:34:34,581 --> 00:34:36,708
You'd better put out an all-points bulletin.

309
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:40,254
That's not good news, Diana.
Right now we need any lead we can get.

310
00:34:40,337 --> 00:34:43,632
Thackery's apparently made arrangements
to leave the country tonight.

311
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:44,841
Tonight?

312
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:48,553
Which means he'll be passing
those counterfeit plates off today.

313
00:34:48,637 --> 00:34:52,599
And must have figured out a clever way
of moving the gold back to England.

314
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:56,561
It's rumored that there is a cheap hood
named Vincent Bonelli...

315
00:34:56,645 --> 00:35:00,023
who's negotiating a gold deal
that's going to put him in the big time.

316
00:35:00,107 --> 00:35:01,191
Bonelli?

317
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,902
He started out as a trigger boy in Philly.

318
00:35:03,985 --> 00:35:07,823
I should think a deal with Thackery
would put him in way over his head.

319
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:12,577
In any case, if a hood like that gets a hold
of those plates, we're in big trouble.

320
00:35:12,661 --> 00:35:16,414
Say no more.
I'll keep looking for Mr. O'Hanlon.

321
00:35:33,556 --> 00:35:36,476
Nail it up tight,
I don't want this guy getting out.

322
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:40,438
All right, now get him up, let's go.
Straight back.

323
00:35:44,234 --> 00:35:45,735
Straight back to the door.

324
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:48,404
There you go. Come on.

325
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:53,576
All right, open that door now,
and lock him in.

326
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:01,960
Yeah, that's it.

327
00:36:02,835 --> 00:36:07,006
That will get you out of my hair
and keep you out, old man.

328
00:36:07,548 --> 00:36:11,052
Anybody comes looking for you,
and opens that door...

329
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,348
you're gonna meet with
a very unfortunate accident.

330
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:30,339
Hey, what is this? Hello!
Where in the devil...

331
00:37:34,593 --> 00:37:37,179
Help! Get me out of here.

332
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:44,937
Help! Somebody help me.
Get me out of here.

333
00:38:02,788 --> 00:38:05,666
Would you be looking for someone,
Miss Wonder Woman?

334
00:38:10,545 --> 00:38:13,673
As a matter of fact
I was looking for you, Mr. O'Hanlon.

335
00:38:14,216 --> 00:38:17,302
You thought I was one place
when actually I was somewhere else.

336
00:38:17,385 --> 00:38:21,014
A common enough mistake. That thief,
Bonelli, thought the same thing.

337
00:38:21,348 --> 00:38:24,351
- What are you doing in here?
- Getting my gold.

338
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:27,646
If you had cooperated
with Diana Prince before...

339
00:38:27,812 --> 00:38:29,522
she might have been able to help you.

340
00:38:29,606 --> 00:38:31,733
Don't you bandy words with me,
Wonder Woman.

341
00:38:31,816 --> 00:38:35,487
You, of all people, should know the rules
under which I must operate.

342
00:38:38,406 --> 00:38:40,700
Do you have any idea where they went?

343
00:38:40,784 --> 00:38:42,869
If I knew that
do you think I'd be standing here?

344
00:38:42,952 --> 00:38:46,748
Mr. O'Hanlon, this is the center
of Bonelli's operations, isn't it?

345
00:38:46,831 --> 00:38:50,043
It is that. Would you care for a tour?
Follow me, ma'am.

346
00:38:54,798 --> 00:38:57,175
Here's where he conducted his business.

347
00:39:02,514 --> 00:39:06,226
I think I might have an idea
where Mr. Thackery is conducting his.

348
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:07,727
Where's that?

349
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:11,814
If we're lucky, it's near here,
and that's where the gold is headed.

350
00:39:12,482 --> 00:39:14,108
And so are we.

351
00:39:14,776 --> 00:39:17,904
By we I mean the IADC and
several squad cars, Mr. O'Hanlon.

352
00:39:17,987 --> 00:39:21,949
'Cause I'd like for you to call Steve Trevor
at the IADC, and...

353
00:39:40,258 --> 00:39:41,384
Rasputin.

354
00:39:48,391 --> 00:39:52,312
Pretty soon we'll be in possession
of over $1,500,000 worth of gold.

355
00:39:52,395 --> 00:39:54,522
As well as the counterfeit plates.

356
00:40:30,433 --> 00:40:32,518
- He's late.
- No, not likely, Bonelli.

357
00:40:32,602 --> 00:40:35,146
Because of you
it's I who am behind schedule.

358
00:40:40,943 --> 00:40:43,112
So let's see what you have. Get on with it.

359
00:40:43,196 --> 00:40:44,447
The doors, come on.

360
00:41:00,713 --> 00:41:01,923
This could take hours.

361
00:41:02,006 --> 00:41:05,134
Bonelli could be meeting Thackery
any place in the airport.

362
00:41:05,217 --> 00:41:06,802
Maybe we'd better split up.

363
00:41:06,886 --> 00:41:09,263
That's a good idea, I'll go with them.

364
00:41:09,555 --> 00:41:10,598
Steve.

365
00:41:20,983 --> 00:41:22,151
Let's go.

366
00:41:31,744 --> 00:41:33,037
It's all there.

367
00:41:33,704 --> 00:41:36,123
The question is, where are the plates?

368
00:41:36,332 --> 00:41:37,499
The plates?

369
00:41:37,583 --> 00:41:40,794
Why, they're where they've always been,
there in Rasputin's vest.

370
00:41:44,006 --> 00:41:45,382
Go get him, Raucher.

371
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:59,813
What are you trying to pull, Thackery?

372
00:42:00,606 --> 00:42:03,859
It seems to me as if Rasputin doesn't
want to give up the plates.

373
00:42:03,942 --> 00:42:05,652
I can't say I blame him.

374
00:42:09,156 --> 00:42:13,535
- Shoot the dog.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

375
00:42:27,507 --> 00:42:31,595
Your two friends will load this gold
into that helicopter. Now.

376
00:42:35,766 --> 00:42:37,809
You there, old man. Stop.

377
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:39,686
Hold it. Nobody moves.

378
00:42:44,274 --> 00:42:46,193
Everybody, drop your weapons.

379
00:42:49,362 --> 00:42:52,532
Pat, it's all right. Get down from there.

380
00:42:52,949 --> 00:42:56,036
I could've handled it myself, missy.
You're my witness.

381
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:03,376
Hold it there, Thackery.

382
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,340
Move very carefully. And very slowly.

383
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,263
Come on now, old man,
get in here quickly.

384
00:44:41,347 --> 00:44:42,432
Quickly.

385
00:44:43,766 --> 00:44:45,685
Come on, let's get out of here.

386
00:45:06,747 --> 00:45:08,332
Get out!

387
00:45:20,303 --> 00:45:21,971
Will you put me down?

388
00:45:22,388 --> 00:45:25,516
I'd just as soon not make it a habit
of saving your life.

389
00:45:30,646 --> 00:45:32,231
Let's get out of here.

390
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:43,033
What's going on? Get us out of here.

391
00:45:46,871 --> 00:45:48,247
Get out of here.

392
00:45:52,501 --> 00:45:53,961
Get us out of here.

393
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:32,791
Rasputin, attack.

394
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,587
Come on, old fellow.

395
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:39,881
You know better than that. Sit.

396
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,059
Charming puppy.

397
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:55,439
Mr. O'Hanlon, how did you do that?

398
00:46:55,814 --> 00:46:59,109
We all have our little secrets,
don't we, Miss Wonder Woman?

399
