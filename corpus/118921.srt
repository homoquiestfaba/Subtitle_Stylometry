1
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:28,868
lt isn't lucrative.

2
00:01:30,404 --> 00:01:34,932
Yeah, you got to always consider
the cost preparation. Ask Uri.

3
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:36,740
Hold on a second.

4
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:40,778
Hello? What's up?

5
00:01:57,931 --> 00:02:00,729
l'm good. l had a great meeting today.

6
00:02:00,934 --> 00:02:03,630
Damon Dash. Great meeting.

7
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:06,099
Yeah. Hold on a second.

8
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:08,465
Let me take this, man.

9
00:02:24,457 --> 00:02:28,188
Yes, Damon is definitely.... Hello?
Damon is definitely building the studio.

10
00:02:28,462 --> 00:02:31,659
l'm definitely producing,
and you are in.

11
00:02:58,992 --> 00:03:01,426
Listen to me very carefully.
This is my year.

12
00:03:01,495 --> 00:03:05,363
l have two guaranteed shots
at blowing up. Number one:

13
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:09,162
Damon Dash is buying a movie studio
and making me his top producer.

14
00:03:09,503 --> 00:03:13,530
And number two: if by some freak
accident his deal falls through...

15
00:03:13,507 --> 00:03:17,603
then Count Tommaso Lupo,
this billionaire ltalian media mogul...

16
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,240
is desperate to hire me
as his right-hand guy.

17
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:34,883
Yeah. Check out Belize.

18
00:04:35,588 --> 00:04:37,488
lt's off the coast of Mexico.

19
00:04:38,592 --> 00:04:41,584
lt seems to me
they've got very bribable cops.

20
00:04:41,595 --> 00:04:44,428
-Ford!
-l'll call you back.

21
00:04:44,598 --> 00:04:46,225
-Where have you been?
-Hey, sweetie!

22
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:48,260
-lt's been two years!
-How are you?

23
00:04:48,602 --> 00:04:51,162
No! Where have you been?
lt's been two years.

24
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:54,267
You remember $9,300, what l gave
you when you were a bum?

25
00:04:54,107 --> 00:04:57,167
Are you still a bum?
l want my money, $9,300.

26
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,602
-You seriously hitting me for $9,300?
-l called. l sent e-mails.

27
00:05:00,614 --> 00:05:03,481
You haven't returned
any of my messages. Are you crazy?

28
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:05,517
-This is incredible.
-Where is my money?

29
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:08,611
-l was talking about you...
-No! $9,300! Let's talk about that!

30
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:10,249
...with Damon Dash. Are you finished?

31
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:12,648
l don't care about Damon Dash.
No, l'm not finished.

32
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:14,924
-Go ahead, finish.
-l want $9,300. Remember that?

33
00:05:15,128 --> 00:05:18,188
-l gave it to you when l didn't have it.
-You should finish.

34
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:21,294
-And l felt sorry for you!
-l'm producing two films with Damon.

35
00:05:21,634 --> 00:05:25,161
-l want $9,300. l don't care about him!
-He's building a film studio.

36
00:05:25,138 --> 00:05:28,266
-l don't care!
-Showed him pictures, you'll be a star.

37
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:31,235
-l don't care about being a star!
-l was just talking about you.

38
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:34,375
-l want $9,300.
-And he loves the idea. This is classic.

39
00:05:34,147 --> 00:05:36,980
-l don't care. l want my money.
-You want $9,300?

40
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,416
-Get away from me. l want my money.
-l'm offering you $93 million.

41
00:05:41,655 --> 00:05:43,782
-l don't want it.
-And you go for chump change.

42
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:47,058
-We'll talk, after you show up with it.
-l used to think you're a moron.

43
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,857
-l'm wrong! You've got a psychosis!
-You are wrong. l want my money!

44
00:05:51,164 --> 00:05:53,189
lt's like a self-destructive disease!

45
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,225
-You're crazy!
-l wish you were a moron.

46
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:58,296
-l want my money. $9,300.
-Look around.

47
00:05:58,672 --> 00:06:02,164
-l am not looking around.
-You will always remember you blew it.

48
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:06,043
-l want my money now!
-A chance at fame for cigarette money.

49
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:09,876
You want it? l'm going to a meeting.
l've got $10,000 in my jacket.

50
00:06:09,682 --> 00:06:12,242
-Hand it over! l want it right now!
-Are you sure?

51
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:15,245
-Give it! Don't look at me like that!
-Are you positive?

52
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:18,249
-l want my money! Now!
-This is the moment.

53
00:06:18,191 --> 00:06:21,058
-The ship is sailing away.
-Give me my money!

54
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:24,459
-You're killing the golden goose. Fine!
-Right now! That's all l want.

55
00:06:24,197 --> 00:06:27,166
You're pissing me off so much,
l'm going to give it to you.

56
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,599
You don't have it. Liar!

57
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:33,104
-l'm not gonna 'cause you're a moron!
-You're such a liar, you make me sick!

58
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:37,575
-You're sick, destructive. Won't give it.
-l want my money!

59
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:40,271
Goodbye, moron!
Remember this moment.

60
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:43,580
Oh, my God!
Ford, don't walk away from me, Ford!

61
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:46,311
Excuse me,
are you Prof. Ben Rabinowitz?

62
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,248
Yes. You must be Vera. Great to meet
you. l had no idea you were this lovely.

63
00:06:51,224 --> 00:06:52,316
Thank you.

64
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:57,492
-What's up?
-You're late. That's what's up.

65
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,254
l had a meeting in the park.

66
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:01,359
-This is not a meeting?
-What you got?

67
00:07:01,234 --> 00:07:04,533
Listen. 1-900 phone calls.
Are you familiar with that kind of stuff?

68
00:07:04,737 --> 00:07:06,671
-l'm sure you made a couple.
-A few.

69
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,368
We could set up an account,
outside of the country.

70
00:07:09,242 --> 00:07:12,973
Let me ask, as l'm interested
when someone applies for a job...

71
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:16,943
as an assistant, because it's a job
that can be any number of things.

72
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,846
What do you want from this job,
and what do you want from life?

73
00:07:21,254 --> 00:07:22,915
Where are you in your life now?

74
00:07:22,756 --> 00:07:24,348
Wow, that's a big question.

75
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:26,783
You'll need bribe money
for the local cops.

76
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,160
lt's not a lot of money.
You know what l mean?

77
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:31,958
You got to check out
what's the best place. Bermuda....

78
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:35,792
lt's a safe common thing because
they're out of our jurisdiction out there.

79
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:37,532
l read the book you just published.

80
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:39,705
<i>-Horror of Horrors,</i> yes.
-Very interesting.

81
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:41,297
-Prof. Rabs.
-Hey.

82
00:07:41,274 --> 00:07:45,404
-Hey, how you doing?
-This your friend? How you doing?

83
00:07:45,778 --> 00:07:48,542
-This is, l hope, my new assistant.
-How you doing?

84
00:07:48,281 --> 00:07:50,511
-This is my guy l was telling you about.
-Yes.

85
00:07:50,784 --> 00:07:52,376
Ready to do the damn thing.

86
00:07:52,285 --> 00:07:55,584
Good. What l'm doing is these guys
are gonna come into my class.

87
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:59,691
-lt's open season. Trying to mix races.
-You're going to work for this guy?

88
00:07:59,793 --> 00:08:01,693
l'm going to try to.

89
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:04,559
Carol!

90
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:08,131
Gas, gasoline prices are going up
like crazy. l got a guy...

91
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:10,292
bringing in.... He owns
a gas station down in Brooklyn.

92
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:13,329
What we do is
mix a little water with the gasoline.

93
00:08:13,306 --> 00:08:17,470
They're gonna come in thinking they're
gonna get a lecture prepared by me...

94
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,438
and instead l'm going to step back
and turn over the hour to you...

95
00:08:20,814 --> 00:08:23,908
and just say to them,
''Experience this reality.''

96
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:26,377
Hey, Carol!

97
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,310
Not enough
to mess up the actual cars...

98
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:31,779
but just enough to make it worthwhile,
you know what l mean?

99
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:37,262
No, you get a layover on.... Listen.
You get a little layover on the money.

100
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,525
What are we, the consultants?

101
00:08:39,332 --> 00:08:43,462
The fucking thing adds up. We go in.

102
00:08:43,836 --> 00:08:46,964
We set up the guy.
Why is this funny to you?

103
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,242
lt's remarkable how one book
and one course...

104
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:54,836
can serve to bring out
all kinds of people...

105
00:08:55,348 --> 00:09:00,285
and connect and erase
artificial boundary lines.

106
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:03,481
-People are plagued by sexual--
-ls that Mike Tyson back there?

107
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:06,416
Hey, Carol! l don't believe this shit.

108
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:12,229
Excuse me. Mike Tyson.

109
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:17,996
l'm Hassan Al-lbrahim Ben Rabinowitz.
l'm a professor of African studies...

110
00:09:18,371 --> 00:09:22,831
at the university here. And l would
love it if you would come to my class...

111
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:26,936
to talk to my students because l think
they could benefit greatly from you.

112
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,749
Listen, brother, l'm not who you
believe l'm to be. l'm Buck, nigger.

113
00:09:31,884 --> 00:09:34,614
l'm Buck from Minnesota.
You don't know me.

114
00:09:34,387 --> 00:09:38,824
Take the finance pages. There were
two stocks with the same symbol.

115
00:09:38,892 --> 00:09:42,794
One was on NASDAQ. One was
on the American Stock Exchange.

116
00:09:42,896 --> 00:09:46,332
One was worth 50¢ a stock
and the other was worth $<i>7</i>5 a stock.

117
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,993
-You're not Mike Tyson?
-No, nigger. l'm Buck.

118
00:09:49,402 --> 00:09:52,769
-l thought you were Mike Tyson.
-l'm Buck. l don't give a fuck!

119
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:56,569
-Fucking Christ! Hold on a second.
-lt's perfectly legal. lf you got the....

120
00:09:59,913 --> 00:10:01,278
Shit. l'm sorry, Ford.

121
00:10:01,414 --> 00:10:05,111
lt's Buck, nigger.
l'm pimping in the light. Now, go on.

122
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:08,546
lf you knew better, you'd do better.
Get the fuck away from me.

123
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:09,786
All right. Okay.

124
00:10:09,923 --> 00:10:13,984
You know, bin Laden, Sharon,
intermediator, Midwest crisis!

125
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:16,293
Good luck, Buck.

126
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,057
l don't believe this bitch.

127
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:22,026
You should look into this other thing.
What are you looking at?

128
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:25,529
Look over here. Listen to me,
l got this porn thing happening.

129
00:10:25,438 --> 00:10:26,837
What do you got?

130
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,240
Distribution of porn. Bringing in these
beautiful girls from Kyiv...

131
00:10:31,444 --> 00:10:35,847
Moscow, Saint Petersburg.
These girls are working for nothing.

132
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:39,282
-What do you do?
-l'm retired, actually. l work out a lot.

133
00:10:38,951 --> 00:10:41,852
-You do. Where do you work out?
-Sport Club Reebok.

134
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:44,719
-Really? Me, too. Yes.
-Do you?

135
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:45,947
Your name is?

136
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,655
-Vera Barrie. And yours?
-Michael.

137
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:51,452
-Michael, right. Of course, yes.
-Nice to meet you.

138
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:58,528
l didn't want to interrupt anything,
but that turns out not to be Tyson.

139
00:10:58,971 --> 00:11:00,996
-At least he says he's not.
-Are you serious?

140
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:03,135
l don't know.
He says he's not Mike Tyson.

141
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:05,967
-He looks a lot like him.
-This is my daughter, Vera.

142
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:08,345
-Hi. How are you doing?
-Hi, pleased to meet you.

143
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:11,882
-That's an amazing bracelet.
-l bought it downtown in SoHo.

144
00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:14,954
-Would you like something like that?
-Yeah, it's nice.

145
00:11:15,488 --> 00:11:18,082
-So, uptown or downtown?
-l'm on the Upper West Side.

146
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,220
Okay. Maybe l'll see you there.

147
00:11:20,493 --> 00:11:22,688
-That would be great.
-Okay. Nice to meet you.

148
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,258
Nice to meet you.

149
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:27,591
That's a friend of yours?

150
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,163
Yes. lt's a friend, Michael,
l've known for a while.

151
00:11:32,004 --> 00:11:36,771
So, anyways l was saying
that actually.... Oh, God.

152
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:37,976
Prof. Rabinowitz.

153
00:11:44,017 --> 00:11:48,420
l'm jammed, overwhelmed. Maybe the
week after next l'd love to. l'm sorry.

154
00:11:51,524 --> 00:11:53,617
Could you set up,
like, a makeshift set?

155
00:11:53,526 --> 00:11:55,050
-You know?
-Yeah, sure.

156
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:57,087
These girls are working for free,
basically.

157
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,693
Then you gotta redistribute all over
North Hollywood and California.

158
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:03,331
There's a lot of competition for that.
But that's good.

159
00:12:03,536 --> 00:12:07,131
l will absolutely try to.
We'll have some surprises for you, too.

160
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,635
Okay? Sorry, l should have called.
But okay. Thank you.

161
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:14,741
-l don't know what to say.
-Pardon?

162
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:19,246
You don't have to know. What are you
doing today? You having a good day?

163
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:21,418
Just hanging around.
l had to go to class.

164
00:12:21,554 --> 00:12:24,022
Really?
Are you waiting for someone here?

165
00:12:24,557 --> 00:12:26,252
-You.
-No?

166
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:29,050
Do you think l can get
your number sometime?

167
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:30,859
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

168
00:12:30,563 --> 00:12:31,552
l got it.

169
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,265
Ended up being a beautiful day, huh?

170
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:40,664
Yes.

171
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:45,408
Beautiful weather, 80 degrees,
sunshine. You know what l'm saying?

172
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,842
You stay here in the country.

173
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:50,982
-You put a little suit on.
-l call from somebody else's phone.

174
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:54,849
Exactly. You go into a big business,
like a hotel, or something. Right?

175
00:12:55,088 --> 00:12:56,112
Hotel's good.

176
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:57,613
You doing anything tonight?

177
00:12:58,091 --> 00:13:00,525
l'm not sure yet. But l'll let you know.

178
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:02,220
-All right.
-Okay. Cool. Thank you.

179
00:13:02,095 --> 00:13:03,460
Nice meeting you.

180
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:07,964
Sorry about that.

181
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:10,432
Are those students of yours?

182
00:13:11,104 --> 00:13:14,540
-No, those are actually teachers.
-Oh, really?

183
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:15,596
Yeah.

184
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:20,101
And l assume
that's an old friend of yours?

185
00:13:20,113 --> 00:13:22,604
From about five years ago.
Haven't seen him in a while.

186
00:13:22,615 --> 00:13:24,276
Like the other guy, too?

187
00:13:24,617 --> 00:13:28,314
-Actually, it's weird l saw both of them.
-lt is weird.

188
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:33,490
l'm the mouthpiece. So l'm taking
most of the risk. lt's 60<i>l</i>40.

189
00:13:34,127 --> 00:13:35,526
When did you become a negotiator?

190
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:38,119
l'm taking the risk.
You're here in the country.

191
00:13:38,131 --> 00:13:39,928
-lf shit goes--
-l'm in the country?

192
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:42,192
lf shit goes down,
you get five months, tops.

193
00:13:42,134 --> 00:13:45,194
-l'm the one outside dealing with shit.
-Whatever.

194
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:46,935
That raises an interesting question.

195
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:50,438
Did you actually know
those two guys...

196
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:53,635
you strangely enough approached?

197
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:56,706
Or were they new?

198
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:01,985
No. Like l said, one of them, this
last guy, l haven't seen in five years.

199
00:14:02,155 --> 00:14:06,216
lt was a shock to see him. The other
l haven't seen in a couple of years.

200
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:08,923
Now, if we're going to work together...

201
00:14:08,661 --> 00:14:12,188
the only way to make it worthwhile
is if we're truthful.

202
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:17,364
So l am going to say something abrupt
to you. l think you're lying.

203
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,900
l think you took the occasion...

204
00:14:20,173 --> 00:14:23,142
of my odd sudden encounters...

205
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:26,440
to, in effect, explore the possibility...

206
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:30,047
of knowing two men on one street
whom you found attractive...

207
00:14:30,182 --> 00:14:34,744
and there's no reason you shouldn't be
able to admit that if that's the case.

208
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:36,916
Okay, you're right.

209
00:14:38,691 --> 00:14:41,592
No, l hadn't met them before.

210
00:14:41,694 --> 00:14:45,562
Forget it. Listen, mail-order brides,
are you familiar with that concept?

211
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:48,326
Nothing judgmental. ln fact,
to tell you the truth, it intrigues me.

212
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:51,670
And l believe that you're...

213
00:14:51,704 --> 00:14:54,070
obviously in your early-middle 20s.

214
00:14:54,206 --> 00:14:56,868
You're on a journey, as we all are.

215
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:58,574
And that journey is just beginning.

216
00:14:58,711 --> 00:15:00,235
l'm at a different stage of my life.

217
00:15:00,213 --> 00:15:04,149
l feel it necessary now to have
a social-philosophical context...

218
00:15:04,217 --> 00:15:08,551
to feel l'm doing good in bringing
races, colors, and creeds together.

219
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:12,384
You're finding out who you are,
and that's a legitimate place to be.

220
00:15:15,728 --> 00:15:17,753
What are you thinking right now?

221
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:22,724
l think that this...

222
00:15:23,736 --> 00:15:26,603
extremely wonderful sales pitch
that you're giving to me...

223
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:30,231
about how you might be able to help
my life or help me discover myself...

224
00:15:30,243 --> 00:15:33,974
might possibly, l don't want
to offend you, but might possibly be...

225
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:36,544
an intelligent ruse to see
whether l'll fuck you.

226
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:42,517
You are absolutely and completely
and totally wrong.

227
00:15:42,755 --> 00:15:43,915
-Really?
-Yeah.

228
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:45,588
l don't believe it.

229
00:15:45,258 --> 00:15:46,623
You're right.

230
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:50,751
lf you're making me admit something,
l'll make you admit something.

231
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:52,731
And you did. You're partially right.

232
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:57,202
The thing is,
it is a side benefit, maybe.

233
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,033
What l'm really interested in is...

234
00:15:58,771 --> 00:16:02,263
can l be of use
in some interesting way...

235
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:05,801
to somebody who is on a journey?

236
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:09,270
l like to feel connected to people
who are young. That's why l teach.

237
00:16:09,282 --> 00:16:14,219
And it fascinates me to take someone
who is smart and lovely...

238
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:18,417
and just starting out in life
and to be part of that journey if l can.

239
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:22,091
That's lovely, if that's the intention.
l would be grateful for that...

240
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:24,786
because l'm looking for that in my life.

241
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:30,099
l'm not looking for mentors who are
looking for something sexual from me.

242
00:16:29,802 --> 00:16:32,270
Okay.
Then we'll have a great relationship.

243
00:16:32,305 --> 00:16:34,205
Great working relationship, yeah.

244
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:37,572
-We'll start next week?
-Okay. Thank you.

245
00:16:38,311 --> 00:16:41,144
l cannot believe l allowed...

246
00:16:41,814 --> 00:16:44,248
you three to talk me into this.

247
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:48,185
You should be home
grooming yourselves.

248
00:16:49,322 --> 00:16:53,418
lnstead you're getting all messed up
and disheveled.

249
00:16:54,326 --> 00:16:56,191
Can we talk about this later?

250
00:16:56,829 --> 00:17:00,560
Okay, but l'm not introducing you
to Damon...

251
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,359
if you're not crisp and neat and clean.

252
00:17:41,374 --> 00:17:43,342
l'm not going. Okay?

253
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,177
Are you okay?

254
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:54,148
-You're Lori Singer, right?
-Yeah.

255
00:17:54,386 --> 00:17:58,413
-l thought l knew you from somewhere.
-l'm Vera. l love your work.

256
00:17:58,391 --> 00:17:59,415
Thank you.

257
00:17:59,392 --> 00:18:01,326
l've enjoyed it.
l liked you in <i>Short Cuts.</i>

258
00:18:01,394 --> 00:18:03,294
Thank you.
lt's wonderful working with--

259
00:18:03,395 --> 00:18:05,090
Was that your boyfriend?

260
00:18:05,898 --> 00:18:08,366
He's a friend of mine.
A very good friend.

261
00:18:09,402 --> 00:18:13,395
This is unbelievable.

262
00:18:15,908 --> 00:18:17,739
Look, there's no way...

263
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:22,244
you're meeting Damon today.

264
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:27,443
Your feet and your knees...

265
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:31,048
are muddy.

266
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:35,792
Your clothes are wet.

267
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:39,955
l love the right cheek...

268
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:42,764
of your ass.

269
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:44,698
What about the left one?

270
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:55,903
lt's good with your right cheek.

271
00:18:56,949 --> 00:18:58,416
lt's perfect.

272
00:19:01,453 --> 00:19:03,182
So what do you do?

273
00:19:03,956 --> 00:19:07,187
l'm just searching,
walking around and searching.

274
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,085
-Really?
-Yeah.

275
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:12,454
l haven't quite figured it out yet.
What have you been up to?

276
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:16,094
Actually, l'm going to work
on a Woody Allen film.

277
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:17,493
-You are?
-Yes.

278
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,596
-He's great.
-Yes.

279
00:19:18,471 --> 00:19:21,167
That's cool.
Have you worked with him before?

280
00:19:21,474 --> 00:19:25,205
Just spoken with him about a number
of things. And l like his work a lot.

281
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:26,740
-Nice.
-So l look forward to that.

282
00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:30,278
Fun, fun. So you're still doing films?
You're still acting?

283
00:19:30,482 --> 00:19:33,974
Yes. And l've got a couple of concerts
this summer and--

284
00:19:33,986 --> 00:19:35,578
-Concerts?
-That kind of thing.

285
00:19:35,488 --> 00:19:36,512
What kind of concerts?

286
00:19:36,489 --> 00:19:37,820
-l play cello.
-You do?

287
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,082
-Come on, let's go.
-Yes.

288
00:19:39,491 --> 00:19:41,220
-l'm sorry.
-lt was nice to meet you.

289
00:19:40,993 --> 00:19:43,325
-Nice to meet you.
-Good luck, whatever you choose.

290
00:19:43,496 --> 00:19:44,588
Thank you.

291
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:52,258
What are you looking at?

292
00:20:52,565 --> 00:20:53,589
What?

293
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:55,033
What are you looking at?

294
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:56,591
What am l looking at?

295
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,231
You were looking at that girl.

296
00:20:59,071 --> 00:21:01,505
l'm not. l'm looking at
the squirrels running around.

297
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:03,166
There are no squirrels.

298
00:21:33,605 --> 00:21:36,039
Why can't you let us come
and meet him now, Ford?

299
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:37,905
'Cause you're sweaty
and unpresentable.

300
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,101
l'll make it tomorrow.
Go home and get ready.

301
00:21:40,112 --> 00:21:41,704
l think we look great.

302
00:21:58,631 --> 00:22:02,226
Yeah, Ford Welles.
Yeah, l told Damon Dash.

303
00:22:02,134 --> 00:22:06,036
Damon and Biggs were going to meet me
at 1 1 :00, two-and-a-half hours ago.

304
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:10,302
l left three messages in the last hour.
Are they receiving the messages?

305
00:22:12,144 --> 00:22:14,704
Ford. F-O-R-D. Hold on.

306
00:22:25,157 --> 00:22:26,522
This Damon's car?

307
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:41,367
-What's going on, fellows?
-Hold on there, bro.

308
00:22:42,174 --> 00:22:43,232
Nice ride.

309
00:22:43,175 --> 00:22:45,769
-You were gonna let him get in?
-How's it going?

310
00:22:46,178 --> 00:22:49,272
-Ford Welles. How's it going?
-Hold on a second.

311
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:50,648
Can l call you right back?

312
00:22:50,682 --> 00:22:53,344
-Ford Welles. Nice to meet you.
-What's up? What you need?

313
00:22:53,686 --> 00:22:56,086
l was worried
that you weren't going to show up.

314
00:22:56,188 --> 00:22:59,783
What are you talking about? You want
an autograph? You have a pen?

315
00:22:59,692 --> 00:23:01,922
-No, 1 1 :00. Ford Welles.
-Who?

316
00:23:02,194 --> 00:23:04,924
Ashley set up a meeting with me
at 1 1 :00. Right here.

317
00:23:05,197 --> 00:23:07,256
l got a meeting here,
but it ain't with you.

318
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:11,067
She told me we would meet here
at 1 1 :00. About meeting some girls.

319
00:23:31,223 --> 00:23:32,383
Hello.

320
00:23:34,727 --> 00:23:36,319
-Hello.
<i>-Hey, sweetie.</i>

321
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:37,821
Hey, Mom.

322
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,527
<i>Did all the furniture arrive yet?</i>

323
00:23:39,731 --> 00:23:42,029
No, but they delivered the bed.

324
00:23:42,234 --> 00:23:44,361
<i>I hope it's a firm, hard mattress.</i>

325
00:23:44,737 --> 00:23:48,173
-lt's great.
<i>-Great.</i>

326
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,868
Yeah, really hard and really firm.

327
00:23:51,243 --> 00:23:54,041
<i>A firm, hard mattress</i>
<i>is essential for your back, honey.</i>

328
00:23:53,746 --> 00:23:55,270
-Hang on.
<i>-Okay.</i>

329
00:23:56,248 --> 00:23:57,180
Hello.

330
00:23:57,249 --> 00:23:59,877
<i>-Hey, Vera. What's up?</i>
-Hey, you.

331
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:02,015
<i>I'm actually in your neighborhood.</i>

332
00:24:02,254 --> 00:24:03,516
-Are you?
<i>-Yes.</i>

333
00:24:03,756 --> 00:24:04,984
What are you doing?

334
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:07,624
<i>-I'm done with class. Can I come up?</i>
-Of course.

335
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,990
<i>-Okay, I'll see you in five.</i>
-Come straight up.

336
00:24:10,763 --> 00:24:12,060
<i>-Bye.</i>
-Bye.

337
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:17,031
Sorry, Mom. How's Dad?

338
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:20,830
-l got a stable full of beautiful girls.
-What, you like a pimp?

339
00:24:20,773 --> 00:24:25,437
-l'm not a pimp. l'm a friend of theirs.
-That why your collar's like a pimp's?

340
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,712
You got a show going on?

341
00:24:29,281 --> 00:24:32,876
Seriously though, you have not seen
girls like these before. All right?

342
00:24:32,785 --> 00:24:34,582
l'm talking about models
and actresses.

343
00:24:34,787 --> 00:24:38,382
One of them was in <i>Vanity Fair.</i>
One was a daughter of a debutante.

344
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:40,088
l'm involved.

345
00:24:41,293 --> 00:24:43,090
l'm just gonna explain something
to you.

346
00:24:43,295 --> 00:24:46,628
These other people that do that.
l'm in the videos. l love the girls.

347
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:48,595
One of them raps.
Two of them, actually.

348
00:24:49,301 --> 00:24:50,700
Hey, mama.

349
00:24:52,304 --> 00:24:53,771
What are you doing?

350
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:55,967
Capturing your radiance.

351
00:24:56,308 --> 00:24:58,833
Great. ls this a new hobby?

352
00:24:59,311 --> 00:25:01,108
l'll make it one.

353
00:25:03,816 --> 00:25:05,841
-You're hot.
-Stop.

354
00:25:06,818 --> 00:25:08,046
You're hot!

355
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:11,084
-Stop.
-You are, look at you!

356
00:25:11,323 --> 00:25:15,123
-You're making me feel uncomfortable.
-You need to own it, girl.

357
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,491
So, we can have some lunch?

358
00:25:19,331 --> 00:25:21,299
Yes, we're going to have some lunch.

359
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:23,164
Okay, put the camera down.

360
00:25:24,836 --> 00:25:26,827
You're hot. Say it.

361
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:28,363
-Stop, Vera.
-No.

362
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:30,638
-Yes.
-l don't want to.

363
00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:32,470
l don't want to be filmed.

364
00:25:32,344 --> 00:25:34,107
Don't hide from me.

365
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:42,013
-Stop.
-l want to kiss you. Can l kiss you?

366
00:25:43,855 --> 00:25:44,913
Yes.

367
00:25:45,357 --> 00:25:46,449
Good.

368
00:27:09,942 --> 00:27:13,173
Listen, if you want to stop by,
like a 20-minute thing.

369
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:15,504
You meet these girls. You could help.

370
00:27:15,447 --> 00:27:18,245
Honestly, to be quite honest with you,
l don't need any girls.

371
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:22,910
l'm talking about rappers, singers,
actresses, multi-talented models.

372
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:26,220
He wants to know what you're selling.
This is my partner, Biggs.

373
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:27,755
How's it going? Great to meet you.

374
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,292
Weren't you talking
about somebody calling somebody?

375
00:27:30,462 --> 00:27:33,920
These girls are beautiful. l met
your girl Ashley.... What's her name?

376
00:27:33,966 --> 00:27:35,957
Hangs out at that club on Avenue C.

377
00:27:35,968 --> 00:27:38,129
Have a good time. Good luck.

378
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,735
l'm just talking about 20 minutes.
You could meet these girls.

379
00:27:41,473 --> 00:27:43,270
You'd be blown away.

380
00:27:45,477 --> 00:27:48,810
l'm talking about
setting up studio time.

381
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,505
l could produce films for you.
You're starting a studio.

382
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,440
Did l tell you you were hot?

383
00:29:00,552 --> 00:29:02,213
This window is hot.

384
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:10,927
lt's time to try that bed.
l'm not kidding.

385
00:29:14,232 --> 00:29:17,065
Excuse me, Count, l know
Richard Meyers is a great architect...

386
00:29:16,785 --> 00:29:18,946
but the place seems a bit high,
doesn't it?

387
00:29:19,287 --> 00:29:20,845
l'm not worried about the money.

388
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:25,692
l'm not so sure l want to be on display
so people can spy on me in the street.

389
00:29:26,294 --> 00:29:30,424
The Coleman deal is heating up.
l figure we make our move now.

390
00:29:30,298 --> 00:29:32,789
l'm sure the stock will be able to
clear six easily.

391
00:29:32,801 --> 00:29:33,859
lt'll clear ten.

392
00:29:34,302 --> 00:29:37,169
The word is the jackal is
gonna try to make a problem for us.

393
00:29:37,305 --> 00:29:38,465
Let him try.

394
00:29:38,306 --> 00:29:42,037
l've got the preliminary agreement
on the Franco-ltalian telecom deal.

395
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,538
Want to initial it?

396
00:29:43,311 --> 00:29:46,109
Not until l read it. <i>Pronto.</i>

397
00:29:48,316 --> 00:29:50,841
Just say in honor
of the Count Tommaso Lupo.

398
00:29:53,822 --> 00:29:55,483
What <i>Forbes</i> article?

399
00:29:55,323 --> 00:29:59,726
The 400 richest Americans. You're not
included 'cause you're not American.

400
00:29:59,828 --> 00:30:02,763
But they make reference
to you in 1 1 of the entries.

401
00:30:02,831 --> 00:30:06,494
-What kind of references?
-Partnerships, stock positions, etc.

402
00:30:06,835 --> 00:30:09,770
-Et cetera?
-l haven't actually seen the article.

403
00:30:09,838 --> 00:30:12,432
Well, get it for me today.
What about the CDs?

404
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,572
l got Bach, the Beethoven Emperor
<i>Concerto,</i> and the Beethoven sonatas.

405
00:30:16,845 --> 00:30:18,073
All played by Glenn Gould?

406
00:30:18,346 --> 00:30:22,112
Mostly. They didn't have
the Gould recording of the Beethoven.

407
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:26,412
lf l asked you for a Mercedes, would
you bring me a Lincoln Town Car?

408
00:30:26,354 --> 00:30:27,412
Of course not.

409
00:30:27,856 --> 00:30:32,486
lf l ask you to get a Gould recording,
it's because l want a Gould recording.

410
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,490
Give the others to a musical illiterate
who doesn't know the difference...

411
00:30:36,865 --> 00:30:38,457
and find me the Gould.

412
00:30:38,366 --> 00:30:39,560
Yes, sir.

413
00:30:39,868 --> 00:30:41,199
<i>Pronto.</i>

414
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,895
Tell him if he wants to fly in
from Tokyo tonight...

415
00:30:44,873 --> 00:30:48,172
l can discuss it with him at breakfast
Friday at The Regency.

416
00:30:48,376 --> 00:30:50,207
You have the mayor at 9:15.

417
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:53,609
8:30 to 8:45.
l can give him 15 minutes.

418
00:30:59,387 --> 00:31:00,684
Count, Richard Turley...

419
00:31:00,889 --> 00:31:04,381
an influential journalist wants to do
a cover story on you for a magazine.

420
00:31:04,392 --> 00:31:05,484
What kind of magazine?

421
00:31:05,894 --> 00:31:10,228
l don't know. He's a freelance writer,
but anything he writes will be good.

422
00:31:09,898 --> 00:31:10,956
What's his angle?

423
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:15,062
He's a respectful admirer
and he shares your politics.

424
00:31:14,903 --> 00:31:18,066
Does he? What are my politics?

425
00:31:20,408 --> 00:31:22,103
What do you want me to tell him?

426
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:26,643
Meet him. Make him understand l want
to see the article before he turns it in.

427
00:31:27,415 --> 00:31:32,284
Count. Forgive my rushing in,
but l know you appreciate initiative...

428
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,287
-and l was afraid l'd miss my chance--
-What do you have, Ford?

429
00:31:35,423 --> 00:31:38,517
The deal l was mentioning to you
before: models, movies, music...

430
00:31:38,426 --> 00:31:42,294
the entertainment company l'm putting
together. lt's on the verge of fruition.

431
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:45,593
l have these three
actress<i>l</i>model<i>l</i>rappers, all blonde.

432
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:47,264
Very highbrow. All beautiful.

433
00:31:47,435 --> 00:31:51,303
Unbelievably talented. Global appeal.

434
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:54,567
Like a higher breed,
like a more elegant breed of rap.

435
00:31:54,442 --> 00:31:56,933
-Not the kind of thing you usually--
-What's up?

436
00:31:57,445 --> 00:31:59,345
Sorry. Kendria,
what're you doing here?

437
00:31:59,447 --> 00:32:00,914
You told me to meet you.

438
00:32:00,949 --> 00:32:04,612
l said l have a meeting. You're
supposed to meet me at the restaurant.

439
00:32:04,452 --> 00:32:06,317
-Gentlemen. How are you?
-Hi, Michael.

440
00:32:06,454 --> 00:32:08,046
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you.

441
00:32:07,956 --> 00:32:11,585
The Count's running behind. He's only
going to have a minute or two for you.

442
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,020
Wait in the restaurant. The Count
and l have important business--

443
00:32:14,963 --> 00:32:18,057
A count! For real! Oh, my God!
l've never met royalty before!

444
00:32:17,966 --> 00:32:20,196
-This is not the time or place.
-That is so dope.

445
00:32:20,468 --> 00:32:23,096
-This is an important meeting.
-l rap. l'm good.

446
00:32:22,971 --> 00:32:27,635
Different style from what l was talking
about. She is more of a niche market.

447
00:32:27,976 --> 00:32:30,444
<i>Get you naked, can't wait to taste it</i>

448
00:32:30,979 --> 00:32:32,879
This is not.... The others are....

449
00:32:32,981 --> 00:32:37,714
Don't talk about blowjob rap in front of
royalty. You're screwing this up.

450
00:32:39,487 --> 00:32:42,251
Sorry.
My employees are like my children.

451
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:45,118
-He has my number.
-l'm too lenient with them sometimes.

452
00:32:44,993 --> 00:32:48,190
l'll meet you at the restaurant.
Have a good day.

453
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,437
l'm very pressed for time. l thought
l made it clear. Perhaps l didn't.

454
00:32:56,504 --> 00:33:00,338
l operate in secret, so l won't be
interested in your new ideas...

455
00:33:00,508 --> 00:33:04,137
until we resolve the matter that we
were talking about when we first met...

456
00:33:04,012 --> 00:33:06,947
which, frankly, is the reason
l'm standing here talking to you.

457
00:33:07,015 --> 00:33:08,482
l understand fully.

458
00:33:09,017 --> 00:33:12,783
So are you going to introduce me
to this person l wish to meet or not?

459
00:33:13,021 --> 00:33:15,114
-l am. l absolutely am.
-When?

460
00:33:16,024 --> 00:33:17,582
As soon as l....

461
00:33:17,525 --> 00:33:19,083
You haven't even mentioned it?

462
00:33:19,027 --> 00:33:22,394
l have. We've discussed it extensively.
She is dying to meet you.

463
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:25,499
She read all the articles l gave her.
Looked at the pictures.

464
00:33:25,533 --> 00:33:29,663
She said you were elegant and stylish
and dignified and distinguished.

465
00:33:30,038 --> 00:33:31,437
Did he speak to the senator?

466
00:33:31,539 --> 00:33:35,100
He had me speak to the senator.
He authorized me to tell you it was...

467
00:33:35,043 --> 00:33:37,204
economically and politically
a complete success.

468
00:33:37,045 --> 00:33:38,569
Did you get anything on paper?

469
00:33:39,047 --> 00:33:42,778
Nothing on paper in a real way.
The senator is averse to paper trails.

470
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,245
Are you happy with that?

471
00:33:45,053 --> 00:33:48,022
Well, if l can't count on the Count,
then who could l count on?

472
00:33:48,056 --> 00:33:49,387
My sentiments exactly.

473
00:33:49,557 --> 00:33:52,025
You showed her the spread in <i>GQ?</i>

474
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,118
She flipped. She went nuts.

475
00:33:54,062 --> 00:33:57,623
She said you wear clothes as if
they were tailored right on your body.

476
00:33:57,565 --> 00:34:01,262
So what's the delay? ls there
a problem you're not telling me about?

477
00:34:01,569 --> 00:34:03,230
Or a personal resistance?

478
00:34:03,071 --> 00:34:05,904
No. None at all. No way.
None. Zero. Nada.

479
00:34:06,074 --> 00:34:09,271
lf it were, l would understand.
l'm a man of the world, you know.

480
00:34:09,577 --> 00:34:11,772
Absolutely.
l mean, absolutely not. Zilch.

481
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:16,209
When will you do this? l'll be in Rome
and Saint Petersburg on Saturday.

482
00:34:16,584 --> 00:34:18,142
l won't be back for two weeks.

483
00:34:18,086 --> 00:34:20,247
l am with you fully and completely.

484
00:34:20,588 --> 00:34:21,748
When?

485
00:34:23,091 --> 00:34:24,149
Now.

486
00:34:24,592 --> 00:34:26,219
Now? Meaning?

487
00:34:27,095 --> 00:34:28,426
Now.

488
00:34:37,605 --> 00:34:38,936
lt's open.

489
00:34:40,108 --> 00:34:42,599
-Hey, angel.
-Hi, baby.

490
00:34:45,113 --> 00:34:46,546
Shit.

491
00:34:47,615 --> 00:34:49,583
This place is shaping up.

492
00:34:50,118 --> 00:34:52,712
You rich little daddy's girl.

493
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,986
What the fuck are you doing?

494
00:34:55,623 --> 00:34:58,786
How dare you provoke me like this.

495
00:35:05,633 --> 00:35:07,692
-How are you?
-Good.

496
00:35:07,635 --> 00:35:08,966
Nice bed.

497
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:13,699
Firm and hard, just like you like it.

498
00:35:14,642 --> 00:35:17,236
-That's what l said to my mother.
-l beg your pardon?

499
00:35:17,145 --> 00:35:19,113
My place is good, huh?

500
00:35:19,647 --> 00:35:24,016
Once everything's unpacked and the
furniture's in, it'll be a sensational loft.

501
00:35:24,152 --> 00:35:28,452
l am sure it is.
lt's nice when money is not an issue.

502
00:35:29,157 --> 00:35:30,784
l am going to whack you.

503
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:32,820
Where is your sense of humor?

504
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,651
Bend over and l'll look for it.

505
00:35:35,163 --> 00:35:37,063
-Bend over?
-Yes.

506
00:35:37,165 --> 00:35:38,564
Bend over?

507
00:35:46,674 --> 00:35:50,269
l saw this really interesting film
last night, by the way, on cable.

508
00:35:50,678 --> 00:35:52,509
Did you? What was it called?

509
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,843
l don't remember the name.
lt was an ltalian movie. lt was cool.

510
00:35:56,184 --> 00:35:58,175
lt was about this billionaire...

511
00:35:58,186 --> 00:36:01,212
who pays $1 million
to this other guy to fuck his wife...

512
00:36:01,189 --> 00:36:05,455
and the husband actually facilitates
the whole thing. Really interesting.

513
00:36:06,694 --> 00:36:08,389
How is that interesting?

514
00:36:09,197 --> 00:36:12,997
lt leads to some intriguing questions.
lt leads to...

515
00:36:14,202 --> 00:36:16,102
the fundamental existential question...

516
00:36:16,204 --> 00:36:19,401
we all have to face
before we can know who we are.

517
00:36:19,207 --> 00:36:21,732
Namely, what am l capable of doing?

518
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,439
Are you speaking sexually?

519
00:36:24,712 --> 00:36:26,771
Sexually and every other respect.

520
00:36:27,215 --> 00:36:31,311
Let's stick with sexually for now.
You're saying, for me to discover...

521
00:36:31,219 --> 00:36:35,588
who l am, l need to find out whether
l can fuck another man for $1 million?

522
00:36:36,724 --> 00:36:40,455
That's not what l'm saying.
Where did you come up with that?

523
00:36:40,228 --> 00:36:41,991
That's the last thing on my mind.

524
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,255
Yeah, the last. The absolute last.

525
00:36:44,232 --> 00:36:48,692
That's a figure of speech.
lt certainly wasn't a specific proposal.

526
00:36:48,736 --> 00:36:51,068
-lndecent or otherwise.
-Absolutely.

527
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:52,672
Conscious or unconscious.

528
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,799
-That's right.
-Why did you bring it up?

529
00:36:55,243 --> 00:36:56,505
Bring what up?

530
00:36:56,744 --> 00:36:58,735
The movie. Stop toying with me.

531
00:36:59,247 --> 00:37:01,579
-l'm not toying with you.
-Yeah, you are.

532
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,445
Now that you mention it.

533
00:37:04,752 --> 00:37:06,583
Now that l mention it?

534
00:37:06,754 --> 00:37:09,314
Now that you mention it...

535
00:37:09,257 --> 00:37:12,090
l did happen to have, coincidentally...

536
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:16,128
a conversation totally unrelated
to this particular subject...

537
00:37:16,264 --> 00:37:18,630
with Count Tommaso Lupo.

538
00:37:18,766 --> 00:37:20,461
Count Tommaso Lupo?

539
00:37:20,268 --> 00:37:21,929
The ltalian media mogul. Yes.

540
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:24,135
Yes, l know who he is. So?

541
00:37:24,772 --> 00:37:26,364
What do you mean, so?

542
00:37:26,274 --> 00:37:29,243
So where is this going?
What's it got to do with us?

543
00:37:29,777 --> 00:37:33,008
l've been working for him recently.
Odd jobs. He's a collector.

544
00:37:33,281 --> 00:37:34,475
Of what, women?

545
00:37:34,282 --> 00:37:37,774
Antique cars, rare manuscripts,
first editions, you'd be surprised.

546
00:37:37,785 --> 00:37:38,877
Drugs?

547
00:37:39,287 --> 00:37:43,781
He's one of the most legitimate men
in the Western Hemisphere.

548
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:44,917
Coincidentally.

549
00:37:44,792 --> 00:37:46,726
-Coincidentally?
-You said ''coincidentally''--

550
00:37:46,794 --> 00:37:50,252
Right. So the Count saw me
kissing you goodbye on the steps...

551
00:37:50,298 --> 00:37:53,756
of the Metropolitan Museum after
coming out of the Caravaggio exhibit.

552
00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:55,666
What's so coincidental about that?

553
00:37:55,803 --> 00:38:00,240
Because he'd seen you before
in the Air France Concorde lounge...

554
00:38:00,308 --> 00:38:03,471
a year ago, when you were returning
from Paris with your parents.

555
00:38:03,811 --> 00:38:06,507
And here you were again,
affecting him the same way.

556
00:38:06,314 --> 00:38:07,645
How coincidental.

557
00:38:07,815 --> 00:38:09,806
-Smitten.
-Smitten!

558
00:38:09,817 --> 00:38:12,445
That's the word he used.
He said he was smitten by you.

559
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,514
Fascinating.

560
00:38:13,821 --> 00:38:15,812
-That's my point.
-No, thank you.

561
00:38:17,825 --> 00:38:20,123
Leading up to
your own indecent proposal.

562
00:38:19,827 --> 00:38:21,488
l didn't make any proposal.

563
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:23,888
No, but you discussed me with him.

564
00:38:23,831 --> 00:38:25,025
Yes.

565
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:27,198
And money came up
in the discussion?

566
00:38:27,335 --> 00:38:29,701
Money always comes up in discussions
with the Count.

567
00:38:29,837 --> 00:38:32,305
-Did he say he wanted to meet me?
-Yes, he did.

568
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,705
And what did you say?

569
00:38:33,841 --> 00:38:37,607
l said l was sure you'd be fascinated
with the stories he has to tell.

570
00:38:37,845 --> 00:38:42,612
And you'd enjoy exposing yourself
to someone as accomplished as he is.

571
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:45,216
ls that the phrase you used,
''exposing'' myself?

572
00:38:44,852 --> 00:38:48,117
That's not the point.
Then he said something like...

573
00:38:48,856 --> 00:38:53,486
he said he would like to give you,
as a token of his appreciation...

574
00:38:53,361 --> 00:38:55,420
for your loveliness, $100,000.

575
00:38:56,364 --> 00:39:00,425
Which l assume you assume
l would give to you.

576
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:04,964
-l hadn't thought that far ahead.
-Take a shot, stretch your mind.

577
00:39:05,373 --> 00:39:07,739
Well, if you force me to think about it...

578
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:11,436
l'd probably say since you're
in pretty good shape financially...

579
00:39:11,379 --> 00:39:14,576
and l'm just getting started,
you might want to front it to me.

580
00:39:14,882 --> 00:39:18,875
That's not the point. Anybody can get
money. l could with my eyes closed.

581
00:39:18,886 --> 00:39:23,084
That's not what l'm about here.
l'm a mentor. l'm not a hustler.

582
00:39:23,391 --> 00:39:28,055
l'm a conduit. l'm a circuit.
Listen, listen to me very carefully.

583
00:39:28,396 --> 00:39:30,694
My whole mission
on this planet right now...

584
00:39:30,398 --> 00:39:32,866
in relation to you,
is to introduce you to yourself.

585
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,233
You know that.
You're a deeply sexual human being.

586
00:39:36,404 --> 00:39:38,634
You have major erotic power.

587
00:39:38,906 --> 00:39:41,272
The easiest thing,
and the most selfish...

588
00:39:41,409 --> 00:39:45,971
would be to convince you
to limit yourself to one person.

589
00:39:45,913 --> 00:39:50,475
That'd suffocate you and be ignoble
of me. A hustler would do that...

590
00:39:50,418 --> 00:39:55,253
l refuse to hustle. l want to lead you
down the path of Ovid and Sappho.

591
00:39:55,923 --> 00:39:58,551
D.H. Lawrence.
Edna St. Vincent Millay.

592
00:39:58,426 --> 00:40:00,951
To say nothing of
the whole hip-hop revolution.

593
00:40:01,429 --> 00:40:06,059
lt's the path of the Bible. ''Seek,
and ye shall find.'' ''Know thyself.''

594
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:08,925
You are so ready right now
to open yourself...

595
00:40:08,936 --> 00:40:11,734
to discover your capacity
for multiple men.

596
00:40:11,939 --> 00:40:16,239
Multiple in the sense of at least a few,
maybe not at the same time...

597
00:40:16,444 --> 00:40:17,672
but sequentially.

598
00:40:17,445 --> 00:40:20,881
l'm getting ahead of myself here,
and you might not want to hear this...

599
00:40:20,948 --> 00:40:22,882
since you're
a year away from being there...

600
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:25,885
but at some point, you're gonna
be ready to explore women...

601
00:40:25,953 --> 00:40:29,150
and enjoy them.
They already desire you all the time.

602
00:40:29,457 --> 00:40:31,015
You're just oblivious to it.

603
00:40:30,958 --> 00:40:33,688
But that's down the road.
Let's stick to the present.

604
00:40:33,961 --> 00:40:37,362
-All l ask is that you meet the Count.
-Set it up.

605
00:40:39,467 --> 00:40:40,559
Really?

606
00:40:40,968 --> 00:40:42,868
lt's what you want, isn't it?

607
00:40:44,472 --> 00:40:45,700
Yeah.

608
00:40:48,476 --> 00:40:50,876
l thought
you wanted to make love to me.

609
00:40:51,979 --> 00:40:53,571
l did. l do.

610
00:40:54,982 --> 00:40:56,540
Who's stopping you?

611
00:43:35,643 --> 00:43:38,476
You know what l love about
this building, sugar? Security.

612
00:43:38,646 --> 00:43:43,310
24-hour concierge, surveillance
monitors, a high-tech intercom system.

613
00:43:43,651 --> 00:43:46,051
Know what l also love?
The architecture.

614
00:43:46,153 --> 00:43:49,088
No one designs buildings like this
anymore. No one.

615
00:43:49,156 --> 00:43:53,183
Of course no one designs buildings
like this. We live in a different era.

616
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:57,119
l.M. Pei is not Stanford White,
and Rem Koolhaas isn't Mies.

617
00:43:57,665 --> 00:44:01,931
You're saying with a straight face any
contemporary architect can do this?

618
00:44:02,169 --> 00:44:04,603
-No one even comes close.
-Art isn't a competition.

619
00:44:04,672 --> 00:44:07,470
Of course art is a competition.
Everything in life is.

620
00:44:07,675 --> 00:44:10,200
l can't believe l'm married to
such a Philistine!

621
00:44:10,177 --> 00:44:12,702
Having high standards makes me
a Philistine?

622
00:44:15,683 --> 00:44:17,878
You can drop that stuff
wherever you want, Dad.

623
00:44:18,185 --> 00:44:21,052
-l'm starved. l've got to get something.
-How about over here?

624
00:44:21,188 --> 00:44:23,884
That's fine. l don't know
if l have much in the fridge.

625
00:44:23,691 --> 00:44:26,125
Hey, you got the curtains up.

626
00:44:26,193 --> 00:44:30,493
Yes, l did.
And l love them, and thank you.

627
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:35,794
What are we on this planet for?
To make our little girl happy.

628
00:44:36,203 --> 00:44:40,264
She's not a little girl, she's grown.
She's a woman. Get used to it.

629
00:44:40,207 --> 00:44:42,971
Thank you, Mom.
Thank you for noticing.

630
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:47,044
Hey, great mattress, pumpkin.
Firm and hard.

631
00:44:48,215 --> 00:44:51,207
l thought we'd have a nice lunch.
What are you guys up for?

632
00:44:51,719 --> 00:44:55,985
l can't. The man l am trying to get
a job with is coming over at 4:00.

633
00:44:55,723 --> 00:44:57,657
The professor from Columbia?

634
00:44:59,226 --> 00:45:00,693
He's black, right?

635
00:45:01,228 --> 00:45:03,162
No. What makes you think that?

636
00:45:06,734 --> 00:45:10,636
Your mother said something
about sub-Saharan Africa.

637
00:45:10,738 --> 00:45:11,966
That's not what l said.

638
00:45:11,739 --> 00:45:13,673
That's his book, Daddy,
not his skin color.

639
00:45:13,741 --> 00:45:15,231
<i>Horror of Horrors.</i>

640
00:45:15,242 --> 00:45:17,676
l don't care. You know me.

641
00:45:19,246 --> 00:45:22,147
l love black people.
Hey, l've got an idea.

642
00:45:22,249 --> 00:45:25,707
Why don't we have lunch with him?
Your mother and l can meet him.

643
00:45:25,753 --> 00:45:29,814
Dad, it's an interview. He's not going
to want to have lunch with all of us.

644
00:45:31,759 --> 00:45:36,128
Then your mother and l will wait here
until he comes. Get a little peek.

645
00:45:36,263 --> 00:45:37,389
No!

646
00:45:37,264 --> 00:45:39,061
For Christ's sake, Victor!

647
00:45:39,266 --> 00:45:42,167
She is trying to land a fucking job.

648
00:45:45,773 --> 00:45:50,210
At least, honey, l'd like you to take this
golden opportunity with this loft...

649
00:45:50,277 --> 00:45:54,509
and everything that we are trying
to give you to dump Ford.

650
00:45:55,282 --> 00:45:57,477
-Very funny, Daddy.
-Sugar....

651
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:07,283
l'm going down to the car. l get sick
when l think of that would-be hustler.

652
00:46:24,145 --> 00:46:25,407
Come in.

653
00:46:26,147 --> 00:46:28,843
You have to excuse the mess.
l just moved in.

654
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:32,176
l'm supposed to be a man of the world,
but all of a sudden...

655
00:46:32,153 --> 00:46:35,122
l must confess
l feel like a nervous schoolboy.

656
00:46:35,656 --> 00:46:37,624
Well, relax. Make yourself at home...

657
00:46:37,658 --> 00:46:40,218
as much as you can, considering....
Can l fix you a drink?

658
00:46:40,661 --> 00:46:42,094
What do you have?

659
00:46:42,163 --> 00:46:46,361
l have wine, champagne,
water, soda, juice.

660
00:46:46,167 --> 00:46:47,634
l'm a thirsty girl.

661
00:46:48,169 --> 00:46:50,660
-A glass of champagne sounds lovely.
-Okay.

662
00:47:16,697 --> 00:47:18,392
<i>Al nostro futuro.</i>

663
00:47:25,706 --> 00:47:29,836
l hope
the slightly artificial circumstances...

664
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:31,610
of this first encounter...

665
00:47:31,712 --> 00:47:34,180
don't make you feel too awkward.

666
00:47:34,215 --> 00:47:36,342
No. Why? Do l seem awkward?

667
00:47:36,717 --> 00:47:39,447
Quite the opposite. l was just....

668
00:47:40,721 --> 00:47:43,519
lt doesn't matter.
l'm still nervous, that's all.

669
00:47:43,724 --> 00:47:46,557
Tell me, did you have anything
particular in mind?

670
00:47:47,228 --> 00:47:48,320
About what?

671
00:47:48,229 --> 00:47:51,357
Where to go. What to do.
l have my driver outside...

672
00:47:51,732 --> 00:47:55,429
a boat docked at the <i>7</i>9th Street Basin
to take us out to sea...

673
00:47:55,236 --> 00:47:58,467
and my plane and my pilot on hold
to fly you anywhere in the world.

674
00:47:58,739 --> 00:48:00,434
You overwhelm me.

675
00:48:00,241 --> 00:48:02,141
You don't seem too overwhelmed.

676
00:48:02,243 --> 00:48:05,007
You're right, l'm not. l'm impressed.

677
00:48:06,247 --> 00:48:10,946
Actually, l'm not really impressed
either. l'm intrigued.

678
00:48:11,252 --> 00:48:12,913
Maybe l better quit while l am ahead.

679
00:48:12,753 --> 00:48:16,587
No, l don't want you to quit.
We're just getting started. Please, sit.

680
00:48:18,759 --> 00:48:23,253
So what should l call you?
Count? <i>Signor</i> Lupo? Tommaso?

681
00:48:23,764 --> 00:48:25,322
How about Tommy?

682
00:48:25,766 --> 00:48:27,131
Okay, Tommy.

683
00:48:27,768 --> 00:48:29,599
Did any of those options
appeal to you?

684
00:48:30,271 --> 00:48:32,136
Boats, planes, cars?

685
00:48:33,774 --> 00:48:36,402
Not really. You want to know why?

686
00:48:37,278 --> 00:48:41,078
Rushing off with you right now,
even somewhere exotic or exciting...

687
00:48:41,282 --> 00:48:44,649
although it might be a ball, to me
seems like it would be an evasion.

688
00:48:44,785 --> 00:48:47,982
Evasion? Evasion of what?

689
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:51,758
-Of what's going on.
-Going on?

690
00:48:52,293 --> 00:48:53,624
Between us.

691
00:48:54,295 --> 00:48:56,820
What do you want with me,
or from me?

692
00:48:56,797 --> 00:48:58,788
You mean for you.
That's how l look at it.

693
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,734
Okay, what would you like for me?

694
00:49:01,802 --> 00:49:03,963
Novelty. Pleasure. Enrichment.

695
00:49:03,804 --> 00:49:06,034
And where do you think
you can best provide those?

696
00:49:06,307 --> 00:49:07,740
Running around or right here?

697
00:49:07,808 --> 00:49:11,835
l see your point. Apart from being
beautiful, you're a very clever girl.

698
00:49:11,812 --> 00:49:12,870
Not girl. Grown woman.

699
00:49:12,813 --> 00:49:15,543
My mother just straightened
my father out on that today.

700
00:49:15,816 --> 00:49:17,215
-Oh, yes?
-Yes.

701
00:49:17,318 --> 00:49:18,842
What does your father do?

702
00:49:18,819 --> 00:49:20,377
He makes money.

703
00:49:21,322 --> 00:49:23,586
-There's nothing wrong with that.
-No.

704
00:49:23,824 --> 00:49:25,451
How, may l ask?

705
00:49:26,827 --> 00:49:28,192
How does he make money?

706
00:49:28,829 --> 00:49:31,764
A little of this, a little of that.
How do you make yours?

707
00:49:31,832 --> 00:49:33,629
Communications.

708
00:49:33,834 --> 00:49:35,392
Communications?

709
00:49:36,337 --> 00:49:37,668
Yes. Why?

710
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:41,365
We're communicating right now.
You won't make any money from me.

711
00:49:41,342 --> 00:49:44,641
That's okay. l make enough money
from the rest of the world.

712
00:49:46,847 --> 00:49:51,341
l'm curious. Ford told me
about your reaction to me. Your....

713
00:49:53,354 --> 00:49:54,651
Passion?

714
00:49:55,356 --> 00:49:57,517
Passion. My, my.

715
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,191
l hope you won't make light of it.

716
00:50:01,862 --> 00:50:03,557
Not at all. l'm flattered and curious.

717
00:50:03,364 --> 00:50:05,696
Can you tell me how you found
a passion for me?

718
00:50:05,866 --> 00:50:07,458
l mean, we haven't even spoken.

719
00:50:08,369 --> 00:50:10,860
You know the story
of Beatrice and Dante...

720
00:50:10,871 --> 00:50:13,601
the greatest poet in ltalian history?

721
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:18,368
He was seized by her, riveted.
Permanently enamored...

722
00:50:18,379 --> 00:50:22,907
and romantically fixated from nothing
more than one fleeting glance.

723
00:50:23,384 --> 00:50:25,648
l have always been
a creature of instinct.

724
00:50:25,886 --> 00:50:29,413
When something or someone
excites me, l know it immediately.

725
00:50:30,391 --> 00:50:34,225
What happened with you,
l won't say it never happened before.

726
00:50:34,395 --> 00:50:38,855
So in that sense it's not like Dante,
where the vision only happened once.

727
00:50:38,899 --> 00:50:42,733
But there was,
there is this urgency to knowing you.

728
00:50:44,905 --> 00:50:46,668
Knowing me in the Biblical sense?

729
00:50:46,907 --> 00:50:50,399
That's up to you.
As l said, l'm only here to please.

730
00:50:50,911 --> 00:50:54,438
Santa Claus, St. Francis,
Mother Teresa all rolled up into one?

731
00:50:54,415 --> 00:50:56,440
You say that with a touch of sarcasm.

732
00:50:56,417 --> 00:50:58,612
What else do you think
l might want from you?

733
00:50:58,919 --> 00:51:00,386
Want me to take a wild guess?

734
00:51:00,421 --> 00:51:02,321
The wilder, the better.

735
00:51:02,923 --> 00:51:06,484
Love. Sex. Romance.

736
00:51:06,927 --> 00:51:10,488
Someone to make you feel young.
Someone to make you feel desired.

737
00:51:10,931 --> 00:51:12,159
Are you married?

738
00:51:11,932 --> 00:51:13,399
l've been married for 42 years.

739
00:51:13,434 --> 00:51:15,868
42 years. Holy shit. How old are you?

740
00:51:16,437 --> 00:51:19,429
Sixty-nine,
if you'll pardon the expression.

741
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,431
You look pretty good for 69.

742
00:51:21,942 --> 00:51:25,343
Not the greatest compliment
l've ever received, but l'll accept it.

743
00:51:25,446 --> 00:51:28,438
l didn't mean to offend you.
l think age is irrelevant.

744
00:51:28,449 --> 00:51:29,882
You're saying that to be kind.

745
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:32,111
No, not really.

746
00:51:32,453 --> 00:51:35,650
l once saw Picasso on film,
and he was really appealing for 80.

747
00:51:35,456 --> 00:51:38,425
But then, Picasso was Picasso.

748
00:51:43,464 --> 00:51:45,056
How much money do you have?

749
00:51:44,965 --> 00:51:47,729
l'm not sure l follow that transition.

750
00:51:47,968 --> 00:51:50,664
l tend to skip transitions.
Are you avoiding my question?

751
00:51:50,471 --> 00:51:52,701
l have no idea
how much money l have.

752
00:51:52,973 --> 00:51:54,338
$1 billion?

753
00:51:54,475 --> 00:51:56,409
Depends on the day. lt fluctuates.

754
00:51:56,477 --> 00:51:57,876
Do you have a mistress?

755
00:51:57,978 --> 00:52:00,776
As a matter of fact, l do. A cellist.

756
00:52:01,482 --> 00:52:03,382
A lovely and gifted woman.

757
00:52:03,484 --> 00:52:05,315
And how old is she?

758
00:52:05,486 --> 00:52:07,511
Forty. Ancient.

759
00:52:07,988 --> 00:52:09,785
My mother is 44.

760
00:52:10,491 --> 00:52:12,118
May l ask you a question?

761
00:52:11,992 --> 00:52:14,483
Why do you need my permission
to ask me a question?

762
00:52:14,995 --> 00:52:19,796
l will only ask it, if you'll answer
without any fear of wounding my ego.

763
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,662
Do l seem fearful
of wounding your ego?

764
00:52:23,003 --> 00:52:24,698
Are you glad that l'm here...

765
00:52:24,505 --> 00:52:28,601
or would you prefer that l leave and
you never hear from or see me again?

766
00:52:32,513 --> 00:52:34,242
l'm still curious.

767
00:52:34,515 --> 00:52:37,780
What if l had no money? What if
l was a flight attendant for Alitalia?

768
00:52:38,018 --> 00:52:40,782
Aren't you too old to be
a flight attendant for Alitalia?

769
00:52:40,521 --> 00:52:42,352
Let's say
they made an exception for me.

770
00:52:42,523 --> 00:52:44,320
You wouldn't be you
if you had no money.

771
00:52:44,525 --> 00:52:47,688
You'd be you, minus $1 billion.
That's a big minus.

772
00:52:48,028 --> 00:52:50,861
ls it important to you to have
a lot of money yourself?

773
00:52:50,531 --> 00:52:51,998
No, not really.

774
00:52:52,032 --> 00:52:55,331
l'm more interested in the idea
of money, how it controls people.

775
00:52:55,536 --> 00:52:57,436
What they'll do to get it.

776
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:01,337
Ford, for example,
he'd do anything to get rich.

777
00:53:01,542 --> 00:53:04,978
He's a desperate, ambitious,
frightened guy.

778
00:53:05,546 --> 00:53:06,877
Why are you with him?

779
00:53:07,047 --> 00:53:08,708
Why do you ask?
What are you implying?

780
00:53:08,549 --> 00:53:10,813
That he's too young?
ls that what you're saying?

781
00:53:11,051 --> 00:53:14,646
That l need to find myself a good
octogenarian to liven things up?

782
00:53:17,057 --> 00:53:20,356
l'm sorry, that wasn't nice.
l'm being mean to you.

783
00:53:21,061 --> 00:53:24,155
All you're trying to do is please me.
l'm giving you a hard time.

784
00:53:24,064 --> 00:53:26,123
What an ingrate.
Maybe l should be punished.

785
00:53:26,567 --> 00:53:29,832
You're not giving me a hard time,
but you didn't answer my question.

786
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:31,333
Why am l with Ford?

787
00:53:32,573 --> 00:53:34,063
l don't know.

788
00:53:36,076 --> 00:53:38,101
You answer
a question like that rationally...

789
00:53:38,078 --> 00:53:40,342
it never sounds true,
even if you're not lying.

790
00:53:40,581 --> 00:53:43,277
You knew that. You've been around
longer. So let me see.

791
00:53:43,584 --> 00:53:45,415
He is incredibly beautiful...

792
00:53:46,086 --> 00:53:48,179
and he's a great lover.

793
00:53:48,589 --> 00:53:50,386
And he's funny and smart.

794
00:53:52,092 --> 00:53:54,322
And he would kill for me
if l asked him to.

795
00:53:54,595 --> 00:53:58,827
Who would you want killed?
You don't seem like a violent person.

796
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:03,058
You never know. When l get angry,
l really lose it sometimes.

797
00:54:05,105 --> 00:54:07,403
How much money do you have
in your pocket right now?

798
00:54:07,608 --> 00:54:09,075
About $10,000.

799
00:54:11,612 --> 00:54:13,239
Apart from this.

800
00:54:15,115 --> 00:54:16,241
What's that?

801
00:54:16,617 --> 00:54:18,278
$100,000.

802
00:54:18,118 --> 00:54:20,052
-What for?
-You.

803
00:54:21,121 --> 00:54:22,452
To do what with?

804
00:54:22,623 --> 00:54:24,352
Whatever you like. lt's yours.

805
00:54:24,124 --> 00:54:26,524
l get that part.
But what is the purpose?

806
00:54:26,627 --> 00:54:29,357
The purpose?
lt's a token of my esteem.

807
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:34,226
l thought Ford had spoken to you.
l hope l'm not embarrassing you.

808
00:54:34,134 --> 00:54:35,123
Embarrassing me?

809
00:54:35,135 --> 00:54:37,763
lf l were you, l'd be worried
about embarrassing myself.

810
00:54:38,138 --> 00:54:40,504
lt's not enough?
ls that what you're saying?

811
00:54:40,641 --> 00:54:44,099
How would l know if it's enough
when l don't know what it's for?

812
00:54:44,144 --> 00:54:47,443
For a really nice dinner, absolutely.
lt's more than enough.

813
00:54:47,648 --> 00:54:49,377
Maybe even 10 dinners, 20.

814
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:52,312
Twenty maybe even,
and a couple of lunches.

815
00:54:53,153 --> 00:54:56,645
But for something else, l don't know.
Why? What did you have in mind?

816
00:54:56,657 --> 00:54:59,490
l told you, to make you happy.

817
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,787
Yeah, so you say.

818
00:55:04,164 --> 00:55:08,157
Unfortunately, you'd come up a bit
short if that's your primary intention.

819
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:12,570
How much more might l need to...

820
00:55:13,173 --> 00:55:14,538
come up...

821
00:55:14,675 --> 00:55:15,869
<i>aumentare...</i>

822
00:55:17,177 --> 00:55:19,611
long enough for your satisfaction?

823
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,170
l don't know.

824
00:55:22,683 --> 00:55:26,210
Why don't you run out for a while
and come back and surprise me?

825
00:55:27,187 --> 00:55:31,123
-Are we talking all cash?
-l'm not talking. You are.

826
00:56:42,763 --> 00:56:45,391
Would $1 million interest you?

827
00:57:00,781 --> 00:57:02,180
What's your rush?

828
00:59:58,441 --> 01:00:00,909
There's no way to verify
that the painting is authentic.

829
01:00:00,994 --> 01:00:04,657
l'm asking is there any way to verify
that the painting is inauthentic.

830
01:00:04,497 --> 01:00:07,261
Well, find out. l'll talk to you later.

831
01:00:18,011 --> 01:00:19,137
Vera.

832
01:00:20,013 --> 01:00:22,573
Hey, what's going on? Vera!

833
01:00:25,018 --> 01:00:26,110
Hey!

834
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,011
What's the matter?
Hey, would you stop--

835
01:00:30,523 --> 01:00:32,013
Don't touch me!

836
01:00:32,025 --> 01:00:35,290
-l never want to see you again.
-What's the problem?

837
01:00:35,028 --> 01:00:36,655
-Fucking prick!
-What happened?

838
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:40,625
l can fix it, but l can't do anything
unless you tell me what's gone wrong!

839
01:00:40,533 --> 01:00:42,524
The only thing gone wrong
in my life is you...

840
01:00:42,535 --> 01:00:44,662
the only way you could fix it
is by disappearing.

841
01:00:45,038 --> 01:00:46,630
What happened? Did he hurt you?

842
01:00:46,539 --> 01:00:49,064
No, he didn't hurt me.
Get the fuck away from me!

843
01:00:49,042 --> 01:00:51,909
He did something to you,
or you wouldn't be acting like this.

844
01:00:52,045 --> 01:00:53,774
Get away from me
before l destroy you.

845
01:00:54,047 --> 01:00:57,107
l will, just tell me one thing.
Did he fuck you?

846
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:59,382
Yeah, he did
what you arranged for him to do.

847
01:00:59,552 --> 01:01:01,520
Okay. So where's the money?

848
01:01:01,554 --> 01:01:03,749
-What money?
-The $100,000.

849
01:01:03,556 --> 01:01:04,955
The $100,000?

850
01:01:05,058 --> 01:01:07,322
How about the $1,000?
How about the $100?

851
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,118
l don't follow.

852
01:01:09,062 --> 01:01:10,051
No, of course you don't.

853
01:01:10,063 --> 01:01:12,156
That's why we're having
this idiotic argument...

854
01:01:12,565 --> 01:01:14,692
you are who you are, you'll always be.

855
01:01:14,567 --> 01:01:16,762
The richest man in ltaly.
An international mogul?

856
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:18,094
That's what he is.

857
01:01:18,071 --> 01:01:20,130
That's not what he is.
He is a fraud. Like you.

858
01:01:20,073 --> 01:01:21,768
A fraud, how? What did he do?

859
01:01:22,075 --> 01:01:24,635
lt's not what he did.
lt's what he didn't do.

860
01:01:25,078 --> 01:01:28,514
-He fucked you and didn't pay you?
-l'm not telling you anything.

861
01:01:28,581 --> 01:01:30,071
l'm trying to get away from you!

862
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:33,109
Why didn't you get the money
before you had sex with him?

863
01:01:33,086 --> 01:01:36,487
Don't you dare blame me for this!
You set this up! You chose him!

864
01:01:36,589 --> 01:01:38,989
You promoted him
and l have to say, ''Cash up front!''

865
01:01:39,092 --> 01:01:40,218
What am l supposed to be...

866
01:01:40,593 --> 01:01:43,118
some streetwalker,
picking up derelicts for dinner money?

867
01:01:43,096 --> 01:01:45,428
Listen, this is a serious problem.
l can handle it.

868
01:01:45,598 --> 01:01:47,793
Go back to the apartment,
wait for further notice.

869
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,727
l'm going to drag this cocksucker
by his neck...

870
01:01:50,103 --> 01:01:53,004
and make him personally beg you
to accept the money.

871
01:01:57,110 --> 01:02:00,807
The Count excuses himself for being
so late. He's usually very punctual.

872
01:02:01,114 --> 01:02:03,014
He's just been delayed.

873
01:02:03,116 --> 01:02:06,643
There has been an emergency
with the ltalian government.

874
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:11,284
The Count is now busy meeting
with the ambassador here in New York.

875
01:02:11,624 --> 01:02:15,492
lt's very important.
The Count is on the phone right now.

876
01:02:15,628 --> 01:02:18,859
Perhaps we can take the chance
to get some background information...

877
01:02:19,132 --> 01:02:21,623
about the Count
while we are waiting for him to arrive.

878
01:02:21,634 --> 01:02:24,728
Absolutely.
He should be here in 15 minutes.

879
01:02:24,637 --> 01:02:25,763
This is Ford Welles.

880
01:02:26,139 --> 01:02:28,437
The Count asked for a favor,
l've taken care of it.

881
01:02:28,141 --> 01:02:29,768
Do you know where l could reach him?

882
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:31,633
Which marina?

883
01:03:04,177 --> 01:03:07,044
The Count will be absolutely delighted
to meet you.

884
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:09,410
Americans are very curious
about this man.

885
01:03:09,682 --> 01:03:12,310
He is the most mysterious man in ltaly,
right?

886
01:03:12,185 --> 01:03:13,482
Nobody knows anything.

887
01:03:15,188 --> 01:03:17,452
He's mysterious
because he's very private.

888
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:21,683
He never gives interviews.
There are a lot of questions to ask.

889
01:03:21,694 --> 01:03:24,959
Our readers want to know
about this man. He's so mysterious.

890
01:03:25,198 --> 01:03:29,191
Why is he going to the White House?
These secret trips to the White House.

891
01:03:31,204 --> 01:03:32,569
He doesn't really know anything.

892
01:03:32,705 --> 01:03:35,367
But what is he doing in China
with the satellites?

893
01:03:35,708 --> 01:03:37,972
He's amplifying his horizons.

894
01:03:40,713 --> 01:03:43,648
Of course the Count will need
final approval on the interview.

895
01:03:43,716 --> 01:03:47,117
l always give that assurance
to my special subjects.

896
01:03:49,222 --> 01:03:52,623
ls it true that he's actually
the most important man in ltaly?

897
01:04:24,257 --> 01:04:26,987
He's very busy. He comes very quickly.

898
01:04:29,262 --> 01:04:33,221
He apologizes for the Count.
He's usually very precise with time.

899
01:04:33,266 --> 01:04:34,494
This is an emergency.

900
01:04:34,767 --> 01:04:36,735
How long will he be
in New York this time?

901
01:04:36,769 --> 01:04:40,364
We're going to need a lot of time
to discuss his whole background...

902
01:04:40,273 --> 01:04:43,470
and the corporation
and the projects in America.

903
01:04:53,786 --> 01:04:57,153
He said we should be able to do
everything. He's very, very interested.

904
01:04:57,290 --> 01:04:59,758
Doesn't he own
every television network in ltaly?

905
01:05:35,828 --> 01:05:39,594
ls he an intermediary for the Vatican?
Does he represent the Vatican?

906
01:05:41,834 --> 01:05:44,769
He would rather not answer questions
to do with the Vatican.

907
01:05:44,837 --> 01:05:47,397
He's not authorized,
and l'm sure maybe the government--

908
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:49,900
-The Count.
-He's coming now.

909
01:06:02,855 --> 01:06:04,755
Michael Burke, the tax lieutenant.

910
01:06:04,857 --> 01:06:06,620
Nice to meet you, sir.

911
01:06:15,368 --> 01:06:18,337
-l notice you're looking at the boat.
-lt's gorgeous.

912
01:06:18,371 --> 01:06:19,633
-You like it? Here.
-l love it.

913
01:06:19,872 --> 01:06:21,533
-This is yours.
-Mine?

914
01:06:21,374 --> 01:06:23,365
For all the good work you've done.

915
01:06:23,376 --> 01:06:25,970
The Count is a very generous man.

916
01:06:26,879 --> 01:06:28,073
Lupo!

917
01:06:29,382 --> 01:06:31,577
Where's my $100,000?

918
01:06:32,385 --> 01:06:34,319
Take it easy! Take it easy!

919
01:06:35,388 --> 01:06:36,548
Hold it! You want to talk?

920
01:06:36,389 --> 01:06:37,447
Where's my $100,000?

921
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:39,824
Come with me, calm down, we'll talk.

922
01:06:40,393 --> 01:06:42,054
-You understand?
-Yeah.

923
01:06:42,395 --> 01:06:44,329
Just a minor misunderstanding.

924
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:48,333
l want my $100,000.

925
01:06:48,401 --> 01:06:49,527
That's between you and Vera.

926
01:06:49,902 --> 01:06:52,894
Don't play dumb, you prick.
Vera says you fucked and stiffed her.

927
01:06:52,905 --> 01:06:54,873
You didn't give her a dime.
Where's my money?

928
01:06:54,907 --> 01:06:56,807
l gave Vera $1 million in cash.

929
01:06:58,411 --> 01:07:00,811
You gave Vera $1 million?

930
01:07:03,416 --> 01:07:05,714
l want you to come right now
to Vera's apartment...

931
01:07:05,918 --> 01:07:09,445
and tell me in front of her
that you gave her $1 million.

932
01:07:31,444 --> 01:07:33,844
-Hello.
<i>-Hi, sugar, I'm in the car with Mom.</i>

933
01:07:33,446 --> 01:07:34,470
Hey, Dad.

934
01:07:34,947 --> 01:07:37,575
<i>How about dinner tonight</i>
<i>at the Tribeca Grill?</i>

935
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:39,714
No, l don't think l can tonight.

936
01:07:39,952 --> 01:07:41,681
<i>How about tomorrow?</i>

937
01:07:41,454 --> 01:07:43,479
-Can you hang on a second?
<i>-Okay.</i>

938
01:07:44,957 --> 01:07:46,185
Hello.

939
01:07:46,459 --> 01:07:48,120
<i>I'm downstairs.</i>

940
01:07:48,961 --> 01:07:50,758
l'll leave it open.

941
01:07:50,963 --> 01:07:52,931
Dad, that was my new boss.
l have to go.

942
01:07:52,965 --> 01:07:55,832
<i>Oh, yeah, you found a boss.</i>
<i>Sunday at 9.:00 at Elaine's.</i>

943
01:07:55,968 --> 01:07:56,957
<i>What're you banking?</i>

944
01:07:56,969 --> 01:07:58,334
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

945
01:07:58,471 --> 01:08:00,871
<i>-Okay.</i>
-Okay, bye.

946
01:08:56,529 --> 01:08:59,327
l don't feel like kissing you right now.

947
01:09:02,034 --> 01:09:05,970
Are you sure that there are no details
that you forgot to mention...

948
01:09:06,038 --> 01:09:08,438
about what happened
between you and Lupo?

949
01:09:08,541 --> 01:09:10,736
Nothing you want to add or subtract?

950
01:09:11,043 --> 01:09:13,739
There is nothing l want to add
or subtract, no.

951
01:09:24,056 --> 01:09:27,617
Now you say that this guy...

952
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:30,028
after you allow him
to do certain things with you...

953
01:09:30,062 --> 01:09:32,997
refused to show
any financial appreciation.

954
01:09:33,065 --> 01:09:36,557
And you say you gave my girlfriend...

955
01:09:37,069 --> 01:09:39,128
$1 million in cash.

956
01:09:39,071 --> 01:09:40,800
Am l right so far?

957
01:09:41,574 --> 01:09:44,202
You are right in saying
l gave a gift to Vera.

958
01:09:44,076 --> 01:09:45,509
As l made clear to her...

959
01:09:45,578 --> 01:09:48,979
it had nothing to do with anything else
that happened between us.

960
01:09:49,081 --> 01:09:50,412
lt was a gift.

961
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:55,349
Purely by an act
of appreciation and love.

962
01:09:57,590 --> 01:09:59,581
-Well?
-Well, what?

963
01:10:00,593 --> 01:10:04,154
What do you have to say
to what he just said?

964
01:10:05,097 --> 01:10:06,496
He's lying.

965
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,932
-Why are you doing this?
-Doing what?

966
01:10:10,102 --> 01:10:13,071
Standing up for my rights?
Refusing to play the fool?

967
01:10:14,106 --> 01:10:18,008
l think the best thing for everybody,
under the circumstances...

968
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:20,010
is for you to pay her $100,000,
or better yet...

969
01:10:20,112 --> 01:10:21,670
to pay me as her designated agent...

970
01:10:22,114 --> 01:10:25,379
the $100,000 you owe her,
and then get out of our lives for good.

971
01:10:25,117 --> 01:10:26,448
l gave Vera $1 million.

972
01:10:26,619 --> 01:10:30,282
l'm not giving her another cent, which
is the way she said she wanted it.

973
01:10:30,623 --> 01:10:33,751
You told me you felt certain things
with me, and for me.

974
01:10:33,626 --> 01:10:36,151
That we had an understanding
we'd see each other again...

975
01:10:36,629 --> 01:10:41,225
and that we would give each other
pleasure and go on. Privately.

976
01:10:42,635 --> 01:10:46,162
That sounds just like me, doesn't it?
Believable dialogue coming from me.

977
01:10:46,138 --> 01:10:49,869
''The sexual pleasure we gave to one
another, a private understanding.''

978
01:10:50,142 --> 01:10:54,078
l'd love to hear that in a court of law.
l'm sure many people would believe it.

979
01:10:54,146 --> 01:10:58,412
l might as well just stand next to you
there. We'd make a perfect couple.

980
01:10:58,651 --> 01:11:01,711
You can say anything you like now.
You could do what you like.

981
01:11:01,654 --> 01:11:04,919
But nothing can change
what happened between us last night.

982
01:11:05,658 --> 01:11:08,991
l think this little escapade
has gone on long enough.

983
01:11:08,661 --> 01:11:10,652
l am sorry that it had to come to this.

984
01:11:10,663 --> 01:11:13,131
l was ready to look to you
as my mentor.

985
01:11:13,666 --> 01:11:17,625
l was ready to do jobs for you,
to deliver for you, to share with you...

986
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:20,696
to bring a little youth and fun and light
into your life...

987
01:11:20,673 --> 01:11:22,265
in exchange for few simple favors...

988
01:11:22,174 --> 01:11:24,005
and some cash
that you can readily afford.

989
01:11:24,176 --> 01:11:26,940
But you turned out to be
exactly what Vera said, a fraud.

990
01:11:27,179 --> 01:11:28,942
And l have no respect
for you anymore...

991
01:11:28,681 --> 01:11:32,640
and l want
my fucking $100,000 dollars now!

992
01:11:50,703 --> 01:11:51,863
Lupo!

993
01:11:53,205 --> 01:11:55,105
Lupo, can you hear me?

994
01:11:56,709 --> 01:11:57,869
Fuck!

995
01:12:00,713 --> 01:12:02,203
Lupo, wake up!

996
01:12:05,217 --> 01:12:06,377
Shit!

997
01:12:13,225 --> 01:12:16,786
Yes, l'm calling
from 55, Niagara Street, Apt. 13.

998
01:12:17,229 --> 01:12:18,628
l need to report a homicide.

999
01:12:18,731 --> 01:12:19,891
Homicide?

1000
01:12:20,232 --> 01:12:22,757
-lt was an accident.
-My boyfriend killed someone.

1001
01:12:22,735 --> 01:12:24,293
lt wasn't a homicide!

1002
01:12:24,236 --> 01:12:25,669
Hello.

1003
01:12:38,751 --> 01:12:40,651
The Count is a major figure in ltaly.

1004
01:12:40,753 --> 01:12:42,380
This is fucking crazy.

1005
01:12:42,755 --> 01:12:45,690
Why am l in handcuffs right now?
lt was an accident.

1006
01:12:45,758 --> 01:12:47,988
An old guy fell down. That's it.

1007
01:12:53,766 --> 01:12:57,862
Ask Vera. Ask her. lt was an accident.
l'm innocent. He fell.

1008
01:12:58,270 --> 01:13:01,171
Death by a blunt trauma to the head.
He died instantly.

1009
01:13:01,273 --> 01:13:04,106
lt was an accident. He fell.
He hit his head on the thing.

1010
01:13:03,776 --> 01:13:05,403
You got anything else?

1011
01:13:05,778 --> 01:13:08,372
l got a witness, girlfriend.
Said she saw him do it.

1012
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:11,374
Saw me do it? lt was an accident.
He was an old guy who fell!

1013
01:13:11,283 --> 01:13:13,911
l'm innocent. This is crazy.
She's in a state of shock.

1014
01:13:14,286 --> 01:13:16,015
She doesn't know what she's saying.

1015
01:13:15,788 --> 01:13:17,346
Looks like you got it under control.

1016
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:18,950
-l do.
-Good work.

1017
01:13:18,791 --> 01:13:22,124
This is crazy. He fell and hit his head.
Why am l in handcuffs?

1018
01:13:22,294 --> 01:13:24,489
Why am l arrested?
l was here when she called 91 1 .

1019
01:13:24,296 --> 01:13:26,355
lf l were a killer,
why would l still be here?

1020
01:13:26,799 --> 01:13:28,790
l stayed to clear my name.
lt was an accident.

1021
01:13:28,801 --> 01:13:29,893
That's not what she said.

1022
01:13:29,802 --> 01:13:32,464
Anything she says otherwise
is because she's in a shock.

1023
01:13:32,805 --> 01:13:34,864
Look at her.
She doesn't know what she's doing.

1024
01:13:34,807 --> 01:13:37,776
He tripped. He fell. He hit his head.
There was no violence.

1025
01:13:37,810 --> 01:13:40,711
lt was a totally natural,
legitimate death.

1026
01:13:40,813 --> 01:13:43,281
Detective, look,
l can see by looking at you...

1027
01:13:43,315 --> 01:13:45,647
that you know your job,
know what you're doing.

1028
01:13:45,818 --> 01:13:47,410
Do l look like a killer to you?

1029
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:49,287
Nothing you say can help you now.

1030
01:13:49,321 --> 01:13:50,754
We're going to take you downtown.

1031
01:13:50,823 --> 01:13:52,757
Get an attorney, you talk to him.
That's it.

1032
01:13:52,825 --> 01:13:54,383
This is crazy, l'm in handcuffs.

1033
01:13:54,326 --> 01:13:56,419
You're taking me downtown.
All l'm saying is...

1034
01:13:56,328 --> 01:13:57,761
l was here when she dialed 91 1 .

1035
01:13:57,830 --> 01:13:59,661
lf l had killed him,
why would l be here?

1036
01:13:59,832 --> 01:14:01,356
l stayed so l could clear my name.

1037
01:14:01,333 --> 01:14:04,063
l could be on my way
to Canada right now. This is nuts.

1038
01:14:04,336 --> 01:14:07,931
l've never hurt anybody in my life.
l have no record at all. l'm a hustler.

1039
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,705
-Let's go.
-Maybe a little harmless hustler.

1040
01:14:09,842 --> 01:14:11,707
l've never been arrested in my life.

1041
01:14:11,844 --> 01:14:12,833
You have now, pal.

1042
01:14:12,845 --> 01:14:16,576
This is crazy! Vera, tell them! Don't let
them do this to me! This is nuts!

1043
01:14:16,849 --> 01:14:19,044
l'm innocent! Vera! l'm innocent!

1044
01:14:18,851 --> 01:14:20,318
l didn't do anything!

1045
01:14:20,352 --> 01:14:22,149
Vera, tell them!

1046
01:14:46,879 --> 01:14:48,176
Hi, Mom.

1047
01:14:51,383 --> 01:14:53,248
Not good, actually.

1048
01:14:55,387 --> 01:14:57,150
Yeah. ls Dad there?

1049
01:15:01,393 --> 01:15:04,191
l am going to come over
and talk to you guys, okay?

1050
01:15:06,398 --> 01:15:07,524
No.

1051
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:12,496
No, l'm going to take a shower
and get myself together.

1052
01:15:12,404 --> 01:15:15,237
l would rather tell you
when l get there. All right?

1053
01:15:16,408 --> 01:15:17,466
Okay.

1054
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:20,469
l love you, too.
