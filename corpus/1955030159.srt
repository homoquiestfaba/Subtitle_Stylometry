1
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,471
Shh. Hey.

2
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,387
<i>Bathsheba Everdene.</i>

3
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,431
<i>Bathsheba.</i>

4
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,984
<i>The name has always
sounded strange to me.</i>

5
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,585
<i>I don't like to hear it
said out loud.</i>

6
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,991
<i>My parents died
when I was very young,</i>

7
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,791
<i>so there's no one to ask
where it came from.</i>

8
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,624
<i>I've grown accustomed
to being on my own.</i>

9
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,750
<i>Some say even too accustomed.</i>

10
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,425
<i>Too independent.</i>

11
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,351
Miss!

12
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,146
Miss!

13
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,390
My scarf.

14
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,351
I lost it.

15
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,064
You must be Farmer Oak.

16
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,790
Gabriel, yes.

17
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,904
My aunt's told me about you.

18
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,789
I'm working on her farm
for the winter.

19
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,984
This is your land.

20
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,622
I'm trespassing.

21
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,543
You're welcome here.

22
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,025
Good afternoon, Farmer Oak.

23
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,189
Good afternoon, miss.

24
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,710
Come by, George.

25
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,627
George, away!
Enough, George!

26
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,185
Enough!

27
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,262
Stand. Stand.

28
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,065
George, stand.

29
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,021
Away!

30
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,621
Away!

31
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,067
George, away!

32
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,783
He doesn't know when to stop,
Young George.

33
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,665
What's this one called?

34
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,980
Old George.

35
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,230
Old George.

36
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,224
So you find me amusing, do you?

37
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,182
Goodness,
it's Mr. Oak.

38
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,300
...and after that
she was gonna be a governess.

39
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,791
But she was far too wild.

40
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,704
Always has been.

41
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,781
Oh!

42
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,382
Miss Bathsheba Everdene.

43
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,468
I've brought you a lamb.

44
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,869
Oh!

45
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,308
Thank you, Mr. Oak.
He's such a dear thing.

46
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,701
He's come too soon
and won't last the winter,

47
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,982
so I thought you'd
like to rear it instead.

48
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,581
Thank you, that's very kind.

49
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,587
I'll make some tea.

50
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,310
The lamb is not why I came.

51
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,150
Go on.

52
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,671
Well, Miss Everdene,
I wanted to ask...

53
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,989
Would you like to marry me?

54
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,830
I've never asked anyone before.

55
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,061
No.

56
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,029
I should hope not.

57
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,501
Well...

58
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,111
Perhaps I, erm, I should...

59
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,340
Perhaps I should leave.
Mr. Oak,

60
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,184
there are things to consider.

61
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,349
Is someone waiting for you?

62
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,863
No, but that doesn't
mean I'll marry you.

63
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,425
Good day to you, then.

64
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,024
Mr. Oak!

65
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,903
Mr. Oak! Wait!

66
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,465
I didn't say I wouldn't
marry you, either.

67
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,429
I haven't ever really
thought about it.

68
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,223
I have 100 acres and 200 sheep.

69
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,904
If I pay off the money,
the farm is ours.

70
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,667
You could have a piano
in a year or two.

71
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,068
Flowers and birds
and a frame for cucumbers.

72
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,945
A baby or two.

73
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,221
Mr. Oak...
Or more.

74
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,423
I will always be there for you.

75
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,262
Mr. Oak, I don't
want a husband.

76
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,466
I'd hate to be
some man's property.

77
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,384
I shouldn't mind being
a bride at a wedding

78
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,428
if I could be one
without getting a husband.

79
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,663
That's stupid talk.

80
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,581
You are better off
than I, Mr. Oak.

81
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,341
I have an education
and nothing more.

82
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,110
You could do much,
much better than me.

83
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,625
That's not the reason.

84
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,820
I'm too independent for you.

85
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,861
If I ever were to marry,

86
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,146
I'd want somebody to tame me

87
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,944
and you'd never
be able to do it.

88
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,862
You'd grow to despise me.

89
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,785
I would not.

90
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,345
Ever.

91
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,227
Good-bye, Miss Everdene.

92
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,750
What is it, old boy?

93
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,225
Stay here.

94
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,750
Stay here, Old George.

95
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,624
Stay here.

96
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,550
George!

97
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,902
George!

98
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,944
No!

99
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,746
It's all yours.

100
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,182
We take no pleasure in this.

101
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,382
We wish
you well, Mr. Oak.

102
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,581
Bathsheba.

103
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,945
What is it?

104
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:45,261
My love. It's your
poor uncle's will.

105
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,790
What does it say?

106
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,631
Read it.

107
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,231
Read!

108
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:59,065
He's left you everything.
It's all yours.

109
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,146
Oh!

110
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,908
Oh, my goodness.

111
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,662
Take care, you hear.

112
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,191
Walk on.

113
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,191
Bye.

114
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,707
So who will join us, lads?

115
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,945
Which one of you fine boys

116
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,670
will put on the scarlet uniform

117
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:54,148
and proudly serve
his Queen and country?

118
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,630
See the world.

119
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,624
Form an orderly line,
gentlemen, at the front.

120
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,981
This gentleman in the straw hat,

121
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,107
step forward, sir.

122
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,830
That's my sweetheart,
right there.

123
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,622
You, sir,
next to the pretty lady.

124
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,188
There's a good strong
figure of a man.

125
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,905
Join us, sir.

126
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,223
Go on. You'd make
a fine soldier.

127
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,189
Always room in the ranks for
a gentleman of your caliber.

128
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,904
It's a roof
over your head. Food.

129
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,707
Who wants a fine wage?

130
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,151
Excuse me.

131
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,905
You might try Weatherbury.
If you're looking for work,

132
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,108
there's a farm there
needs all the help it can get.

133
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,824
Yes.
The young lad there.

134
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,902
I will. Thank you.

135
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,266
And your
friend as well.

136
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,183
You should have a cloak
for a day like this.

137
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,545
Francis
will take care of me.

138
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,750
We are to be married soon.

139
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,111
Good-bye.

140
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,824
Come on,
a decent wage.

141
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,425
Make your family proud.

142
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,749
Food, shelter.
Who will join us?

143
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,907
Go and wake up
the other farms!

144
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,187
Get them down here!
We need more hands!

145
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,461
We need
more men now!

146
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,581
Wake them up!

147
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,820
Go and get
the Smith brothers first.

148
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,466
Protect yourself,
the fire's spreading!

149
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,151
Who's in charge here?

150
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,503
We're losing the ricks!
The rick is lost.

151
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,864
We need to save the barn.
Come on, help me!

152
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,908
Come on, get some more water!
Get some more water!

153
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,580
We need to push
this out. Come on!

154
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,986
Heave!

155
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,784
Heave!

156
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,431
Heave!

157
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,221
Come on, push!

158
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,631
Everybody out!
Everybody out!

159
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,261
Water!
More over here!

160
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,387
The barn's going up!

161
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,827
Get the sacks out,
the root's about to go!

162
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,989
What's he doing up there?

163
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,666
We lose the barn,
we lose everything.

164
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,511
Joseph,
bring those brooms over

165
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,230
and let's get this sorted out.

166
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,064
Look sharp, men,
the farmer's here.

167
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,222
Mr. Oak, is that you?

168
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,590
Perhaps you want
a shepherd, ma'am?

169
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,271
I owe you an immense
debt, Mr. Oak.

170
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,141
If I'd have lost all of this,
I'd have lost my farm.

171
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,307
Your farm?

172
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,980
My inheritance.

173
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,024
My home, too, for a while
when my parents died.

174
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,184
When my uncle passed away,
he left it to me.

175
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,945
Of course,
it's a little ragged now,

176
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,584
but this once used to be
the finest farm for miles.

177
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,260
And I intend
to make it so again.

178
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,300
Perhaps you find
the idea preposterous.

179
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,426
I no longer have that luxury.

180
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,865
I'm truly sorry to hear
of your loss, Mr. Oak,

181
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,430
but if our reversal of fortune

182
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,911
causes you any embarrassment...

183
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,381
Not at all, ma'am.

184
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,546
Billy Smallbury?
9 and 8 pence.

185
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,384
Joseph Poorgrass?

186
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,021
Go on, Joseph.

187
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,341
Go on, lad.

188
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,064
Hat off.

189
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,870
And what do you do, Joseph?

190
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,590
I does general things.

191
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,946
And in spring I shoot the rooks

192
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,180
and help at pig killing, sir.

193
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,347
I mean ma'am.

194
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,746
7 and 9 pence.
And another 9 because I'm new.

195
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,663
Thank you, ma'am.

196
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,862
Now, Fanny Robbin?

197
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,268
Where is Fanny Robbin?

198
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,021
Where is she?

199
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,382
She's run away, ma'am.

200
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,789
She's gone off
with a soldier, ma'am.

201
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,067
Not a soldier, a sergeant.

202
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,830
Bailiff Pennyways?

203
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,431
Here is 10 shillings
and a further 10.

204
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,385
Why?

205
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,946
This ends our association.
You are dismissed.

206
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,910
I beg pardon, miss?

207
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,021
When my uncle was alive,

208
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,228
this was a fine,
productive farm.

209
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,021
Since his death,
it has fallen into ruin.

210
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,030
I can only assume...
Now see here, miss.

211
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,261
You can't get rid
of people like that.

212
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,381
I have resolved
to have no bailiff at all,

213
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,507
I have decided
to manage everything.

214
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,582
Mr. Pennyways, if you'll
listen to me for a moment.

215
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,624
Mr. Pennyways, a fire
threatened to destroy the barn

216
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,862
and you are nowhere to be found.

217
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,789
I have no use for a man
like you, Mr. Pennyways.

218
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,947
You are dismissed.

219
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,300
Get out
while you can, if I were you.

220
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,263
Now you've all met
our new shepherd, Mr. Oak.

221
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,262
You understand
your duties, Mr. Oak?

222
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,462
If I don't, I'll ask, ma'am.

223
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,423
From now on, you have
a mistress, not a master.

224
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,700
I don't yet know
my talents in farming,

225
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,270
but I shall do my best.

226
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,620
Don't suppose,
because I'm a woman,

227
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,781
I don't know
the difference between

228
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,464
bad goings-on and good.

229
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,782
I shall be up
before you're awake.

230
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,104
I shall be a-field
before you are up.

231
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,785
It is my intention
to astonish you all.

232
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,305
Back to work, please.

233
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,509
Perhaps I should wait here?

234
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,906
No.

235
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,987
Nonsense, Liddy.
You're my companion.

236
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,061
All of these?

237
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,221
All of them.

238
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,541
Head high, Liddy.

239
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,503
If they stare, do not hesitate.

240
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,426
Remember, we have as much
right to be here as anyone.

241
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,980
Good morning.

242
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,385
Liddy, if you lay things out.

243
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,110
Yes, miss.

244
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,787
Gentlemen, shall we
get back to business?

245
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,745
There you go, sir.

246
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,460
If you feel it,
you can feel the quality.

247
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,021
This is fine grain, miss.

248
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,181
Thank you.

249
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,067
Perhaps we should leave, miss.

250
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,149
But none of it
as good as this lot.

251
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,381
It's good stuff,
I'll grant you that.

252
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,780
Well, it's up to you.
If you wanna go elsewhere...

253
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,981
No, no, no...

254
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,266
Farmer Stone?

255
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,382
It's Miss Everdene.
Farmer Everdene's niece.

256
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,221
He talked about you
with such great admiration.

257
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,744
Of course, you're welcome
to try elsewhere,

258
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,983
but I think you'll find the
grain as good as it's ever been.

259
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,945
Mr. Stone?
How much?

260
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,903
£5 a quarter.

261
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,949
£3-10 shillings.

262
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,460
It's the same grain,
Mr. Stone.

263
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,787
You paid my uncle £5.

264
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,743
£3-10.

265
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,021
This gentleman
will pay me the proper price.

266
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,423
Apparently not, no.

267
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,987
£4.

268
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,101
£4-10.

269
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,671
£4-05.

270
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,351
Perhaps I should move on.

271
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,342
Liddy, would you help me
with this gentleman?

272
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,865
Of course.

273
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,622
Perhaps you'd like a sample?

274
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,989
How much?
£5 a quarter.

275
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,464
Very well.

276
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,144
£4-10.

277
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,622
<i>Jerusalem the golden</i>

278
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:12,866
<i>With milk and honey blest</i>

279
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:18,990
<i>Beneath thy contemplation</i>

280
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:24,306
<i>Sink heart and voice oppressed</i>

281
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:30,386
He's rich, he's handsome.
He sends the local girls mad.

282
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:34,302
The Taylor sisters
worked on him for two years.

283
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,542
Jane Perkins spent £20
on new clothes

284
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,741
and might as well have

285
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,868
thrown the money out the window.

286
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,900
It's said, when he was young,
his sweetheart jilted him.

287
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,662
People always say that.

288
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:53,343
Women don't jilt men.
Men jilt us.

289
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,181
Did someone jilt you, miss?

290
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,389
Certainly not.

291
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,022
A man did ask to marry me once.

292
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,340
Some time ago.

293
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,226
But I was too restless
to be tied down.

294
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,708
What a luxury, to have a choice.

295
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,911
"Kiss my foot, sir, my face
is for mouths of consequence."

296
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,943
It wasn't like that at all.

297
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,225
Why?

298
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,745
Did you love him?

299
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,701
No, but I rather liked him.

300
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,067
Anyway, it's impossible now.

301
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,066
Mr. Boldwood.

302
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,741
Don't shoot me, please.

303
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,747
I had no intention
of shooting you.

304
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,586
It's Miss Everdene.
Your neighbor.

305
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,107
Farmer Everdene's niece.

306
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,387
I'm managing the farm alone now.

307
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,461
Perhaps you've heard?

308
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,941
Yes, I'm sure
you'll do very well.

309
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,821
In the circumstances.

310
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,062
Well, as you say,
we're neighbors.

311
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,703
Look what
I've got here.

312
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,941
What is it?

313
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,101
Listen to this.

314
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,944
"The rose is red The violet blue

315
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,104
"Carnation's sweet
And so are you"

316
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,669
It's a Valentine's card.

317
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,942
I'm going to send it
to Joseph Poorgrass

318
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,705
just to see the look
of panic on his stupid face.

319
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,664
Poor boy. It's a little bit
far-fetched, isn't it?

320
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,991
What about
Mr. Oak, then?

321
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,666
No. Not Mr. Oak.

322
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,824
Imagine if we sent it
to Mr. Boldwood.

323
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,306
Ignoring you like that,
all high and mighty.

324
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,550
Mr. Boldwood?

325
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,904
Perhaps not?

326
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,665
Why not?

327
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,300
Because I don't think
he'll see the humor.

328
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,981
Perhaps he wouldn't,

329
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,300
perhaps it's too much.

330
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,548
Mr. Boldwood.

331
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,828
You're right.
Perhaps it is.

332
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,744
So we're gonna toss for it.

333
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,821
Liddy!

334
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,265
Come on.

335
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,504
Open, Joseph.

336
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,389
No, Jan Coggan.

337
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:37,511
Open, Jan Coggan.
Closed, Boldwood.

338
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,744
Sergeant Troy, 11:00.

339
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,504
Yes, Sergeant Troy. And?

340
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,782
Miss Fanny Robbin.

341
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,147
Welcome. Step down the front.

342
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,505
Where is she?

343
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,071
I don't know.

344
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,751
Here she comes.

345
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,340
Oh.

346
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,544
Sorry I'm late, old boy.

347
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,151
Not long now.

348
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,862
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered here in the sight...

349
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,742
I can only wait
a few more minutes.

350
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,225
She'll be here.

351
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,823
What do you
think is happening?

352
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,106
I don't think
she's coming, old boy.

353
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,745
Come on. Go on, off you go.
That's it. Go on.

354
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,660
Morning, my love.

355
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,060
Come on.

356
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,864
Bring them in, John.

357
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,307
Grab this one.

358
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,620
Miss Everdene's here now,

359
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,781
so you better do your best work.

360
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,345
I'm looking at you, Coggan.

361
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,910
Yeah,
you keep quiet, Liddy.

362
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,987
What you doing?

363
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,709
Perhaps you'd care
to lend a hand?

364
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,071
You don't think I would?

365
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,631
No, you wouldn't.

366
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,470
Come here.

367
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,350
There,
she's getting in.

368
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,310
Well done, ma'am.

369
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,744
Gangway through.
Hey, Joseph. Joseph, look.

370
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,707
Good morning,
Mr. Boldwood.

371
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,900
Miss Everdene.

372
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,985
Mr. Boldwood wondered if
he might have a word with you.

373
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,789
Mr. Boldwood.
Of course.

374
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,349
One thousand acres.
A mix of arable and livestock.

375
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,385
Adjacent to Everdene.

376
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:56,227
An orchard. Glasshouse.

377
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,428
I have some interesting pigs.

378
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,182
Some other time, perhaps.

379
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,625
Thank you.

380
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,305
You have a very beautiful house.

381
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,111
Mr. Boldwood?

382
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,505
Miss Everdene.

383
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,865
I want

384
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,024
very much, more than anything,

385
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,909
to have you as my wife.

386
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,704
Miss Everdene, marry me.

387
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,901
I...

388
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,662
I feel...

389
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,389
Though I respect you very much,

390
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:10,062
I do not feel
what would justify me

391
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,981
in accepting your offer.

392
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,502
I have known
disappointments before,

393
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,943
but I would never have
asked in this instance

394
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,829
had I not been, er,

395
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,704
led to believe...

396
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,661
Unless...
Unless I am mistaken.

397
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,905
The valentine.

398
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,381
No, you're not mistaken,

399
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,588
but I should never have sent it.

400
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,710
Forgive me, it was thoughtless
to disturb your peace of mind.

401
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,305
So you meant it as a joke?

402
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,589
No. No, not as a joke.

403
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:59,071
Not exactly.
It was impetuous.

404
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,306
I see.

405
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,548
Perhaps you think I am too old?

406
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,630
But I will care for you
more than anyone your own age.

407
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,029
I'm sure you would...
I will protect you.

408
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,546
You shall have dresses,

409
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,823
a gig. Uh, a piano.

410
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,511
I amuse you?

411
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,665
No.

412
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,350
It's only...

413
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,502
I have a piano.

414
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,420
And I have my own farm.

415
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,190
And I have no need
for a husband,

416
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,309
no matter how honored
I am by the offer.

417
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,107
I think I'd like to return home.

418
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,184
Yes, er... I'll, er...

419
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,221
I'll get someone to drive you.

420
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,346
Mr. Boldwood,
I've made you miserable.

421
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,030
It was very wicked of me.

422
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,102
Will you reconsider?

423
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,743
Let me think.

424
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,506
Yes.

425
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,628
Yes, I'll give you time.

426
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,464
I will wait.

427
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,550
You're working
late, Mr. Oak.

428
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,623
Will you teach me?

429
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,151
Here.

430
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,145
Spin the wheel.

431
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,902
Incline it, like that.

432
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,422
And slide it gently.
Spin the wheel.

433
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:08,507
Bit faster. Like that.
Very good.

434
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,346
Now slide it.

435
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,865
I... It's...

436
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,267
Getting stuck.

437
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,949
I wanted to ask,

438
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,781
did the men say anything
today about Mr. Boldwood?

439
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,941
They did.

440
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,147
What did they say?

441
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:33,464
That you'd be married
before the end of the year.

442
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,305
Come on.

443
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,463
Well, I'd like you
to contradict it, to the men.

444
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,870
Well, Bathsheba...

445
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,585
"Miss Everdene," please.

446
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,667
If Mr. Boldwood did really
speak of marriage,

447
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,027
I'm not going to tell
stories just to please you.

448
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,782
I just said I wanted you
to mention to the men

449
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,101
that it might not be true
I was going to marry him.

450
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,342
I could say that if you wish.

451
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,388
But I could also give you an
opinion on what you've done.

452
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,424
I dare say, but I don't want
your opinion, Mr. Oak.

453
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,068
I suppose not.

454
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,422
Well, what is your opinion?

455
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,184
That you're greatly to blame
for playing pranks

456
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,422
on a man like Mr. Boldwood.

457
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,108
Your actions were
unworthy of you.

458
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:36,705
Unworthy? May I ask
where my unworthiness lies?

459
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,262
In rejecting you, perhaps?

460
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,150
I've long given up
thinking of that.

461
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,989
Or wishing it, either.

462
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,826
But I will say this.

463
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,506
Leading on a man you
don't care for is beneath you.

464
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,702
I cannot allow a man to
criticize my private conduct.

465
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,940
You will please leave the farm
at the end of the week.

466
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,182
I'd prefer to go at once.

467
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,026
Then go. I never want to
see your face again.

468
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,188
Very well, Miss Everdene.

469
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,670
Whoa, there we are.
There.

470
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,070
What's wrong with them?

471
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,184
They broke fence
and ate the young clover.

472
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,466
Makes their stomachs swell.

473
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,741
Well,
what do we do now?

474
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,822
Nothing.
The whole flock is blasted.

475
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,585
You mean they're
all going to die?

476
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,661
Most probably.

477
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,821
Another one gone here, ma'am.

478
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,028
Only one way of saving them.

479
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,865
You must pierce
their side with a tool.

480
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,150
A hollow tube.
Pricker inside.

481
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,989
Well, can you do it?

482
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,426
This one's still alive.

483
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:26,786
No.

484
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,868
Can I?
Oh, good Lord, no.

485
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,070
One inch to
the right or the left,

486
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,142
and you kill the ewe for sure.

487
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,151
Not even a shepherd
can do it, as a rule.

488
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,384
Well, who, then?

489
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,665
Gabriel!

490
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,671
Gabriel!

491
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,862
Gabriel Oak, wait!

492
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,626
Miss Everdene needs you.

493
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,981
Why are you alone?
Did you find him?

494
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,711
Yes, miss.

495
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:17,991
So what did he say?

496
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,311
He said...

497
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,191
Joseph?

498
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:26,580
He said you're to go in person

499
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,300
and request him civilly
in a proper manner.

500
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,267
Where does he get his airs?
I'll do no such thing.

501
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,470
He said you'd say that.

502
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,862
He said to reply,
"Beggars can't be choosers."

503
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,429
Mr. Oak.

504
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,346
Gabriel.

505
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,830
Gabriel.

506
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,062
Please don't desert me, Gabriel.

507
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,545
I need your help.

508
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,629
Make room for me.

509
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:08,587
I wanna see.

510
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:09,866
No, don't you start,
Liddy, be quiet.

511
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,869
Find the spot.

512
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,790
Between the ribs.

513
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,025
Oh, Lord!
No, no, no, no, no.

514
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:21,824
Now...

515
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,302
I can see
his heart beating.

516
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:29,980
Come on.
- Come on, girl.

517
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,426
Come on.

518
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,100
She'll be all right.
She'll be all right.

519
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,585
You all right?
You all right, Pixie?

520
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,145
Yeah, come on.

521
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,460
All right, Pixie! Pixie!

522
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,384
Hey! Come here!

523
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,986
<i>Lay me low</i>

524
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:18,061
<i>Lay me low</i>

525
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:22,985
<i>Where no-one can see me</i>

526
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:27,143
<i>Where no-one can find me</i>

527
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:32,586
<i>Where no-one can hurt me</i>

528
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,581
Get out.

529
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,583
Please, quiet.

530
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:54,269
<i>Oh, early one morning
As I was a walking</i>

531
00:47:55,700 --> 00:48:01,707
<i>The fields and the meadows
They looked so green and gay</i>

532
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:05,264
<i>The birds sang so sweetly</i>

533
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:08,828
<i>So pleasant and so charming</i>

534
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:11,547
<i>So early in the morning</i>

535
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:12,781
<i>At the break of day</i>

536
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:15,989
Miss. Mr. Boldwood is here.

537
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:19,223
Thank you. Thank you, Jan.
Jan, thank you.

538
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,225
Mr. Boldwood.

539
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,906
What a pleasant surprise.
Will you join us?

540
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,545
Nice to have you, sir.

541
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,865
A song, ma'am.

542
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,903
I have no voice.

543
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,621
Come on, ma'am,
you've got a lovely voice.

544
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:12,871
<i>Come all you fair
and tender girls</i>

545
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:19,063
<i>That flourish in your prime</i>

546
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:24,784
<i>Beware, beware
Keep your garden fair</i>

547
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:30,790
<i>Let no man steal your thyme</i>

548
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:36,391
<i>Let no man steal your thyme</i>

549
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:42,386
<i>For when your thyme
it is past and gone</i>

550
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:48,705
<i>He'll care no more for you</i>

551
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:55,388
<i>And every place where
your thyme was waste</i>

552
00:49:55,460 --> 00:50:00,671
<i>Will all spread o'er with rue</i>

553
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:06,101
<i>Will all spread o'er with rue</i>

554
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:12,581
<i>The gardener's son
was standing by</i>

555
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:17,664
<i>Three flowers he gave to me</i>

556
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:24,665
<i>The pink, the blue
and the violet true</i>

557
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:30,585
<i>And the red, red rosy tree</i>

558
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:35,948
<i>And the red, red rosy tree</i>

559
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:42,471
<i>But I refused the red rose bush</i>

560
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:48,460
<i>And gained the willow tree</i>

561
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:54,625
<i>That all the world
may plainly see</i>

562
00:50:55,700 --> 00:51:00,501
<i>How my love slighted me</i>

563
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:07,548
<i>How my love slighted me</i>

564
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,622
I thought we were
rather good together.

565
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:15,986
So did I.

566
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,984
We would make a fine duo.

567
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,029
I wanted to thank you
for not approaching me

568
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:22,983
on that subject again.

569
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:27,300
Well, it has not been easy.

570
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:37,822
Do you wish me to, er,

571
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,664
accompany you back to the house?

572
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:42,743
No, I like to walk around
the farm every night

573
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,549
to make sure all is safe.

574
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:49,028
Then I...
I can walk with you.

575
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,382
I've done it many times alone.

576
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,025
Good night,
Mr. Boldwood.

577
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,785
You've been very kind.
A pleasure to see you.

578
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:33,790
Who are you?

579
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,584
I'm sorry.
I seem to be lost.

580
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,785
We're entangled.
Are you hurt?

581
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,226
No.

582
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,460
I'm looking for Weatherbury.

583
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,701
I hope I didn't startle you.

584
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,908
We've got hitched
together somehow.

585
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,470
Here, allow me.

586
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,060
No. No. Please,
let me do it myself.

587
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:53,266
If you lift your
foot for a moment.

588
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,950
Please don't stare.

589
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,785
I don't think I've ever seen
a face as beautiful as yours.

590
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:20,106
You shouldn't be here.
Please let me have the lamp.

591
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,669
A mighty impressive
harvest this looks like.

592
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,461
Miss,

593
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,825
look.

594
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:54,305
Who is he, Liddy?

595
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,622
Sergeant Francis Troy.

596
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,863
Noble blood, full of promise.
Very sharp and trim.

597
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,140
Well-educated.

598
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:03,989
There was good things
expected of him.

599
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:07,145
He threw it all in
to be a soldier.

600
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:10,185
Well, I won't have it.

601
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:11,865
What are you doing, miss?

602
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:14,187
I'm going to tell him to leave.

603
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,631
Sergeant Troy,

604
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,226
I must absolutely insist that
you leave at this very moment.

605
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:24,830
I can't.

606
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,823
Will you follow me, please?

607
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:49,024
What angers you, exactly?

608
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:51,180
Please.

609
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,188
What I said
or the way I said it?

610
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:54,910
You must know.

611
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,506
There must be some man

612
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:57,980
who tells you
that you're beautiful.

613
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:00,148
Oh, not to my face, not...

614
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,984
But there is someone
who kisses you?

615
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:03,221
I've never been kissed.

616
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:13,109
Why couldn't you have just
passed by and said nothing?

617
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:15,781
Do you forgive me?

618
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,870
I do not.
Why?

619
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:22,506
Because the things you say...

620
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,469
I said that you were beautiful.

621
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:31,747
I wonder if you fight
as well as you speak.

622
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:33,106
Better.

623
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:42,302
Meet me. Tomorrow.

624
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,469
I can't.

625
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:46,826
You don't want to?

626
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,266
Yes, but...

627
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:49,751
Then you must.
I mustn't.

628
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:51,789
Nobody would know.

629
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,184
Please go now.

630
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,431
Tomorrow.

631
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,431
8:00.

632
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:03,622
The hollow in the ferns.

633
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:04,861
Do you trust me?

634
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,621
I do.

635
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,384
I give you my word as a soldier,

636
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,269
I will not harm you.

637
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,382
The sword is blunt,

638
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,744
but you must not flinch.

639
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,382
I'll try not to.

640
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,989
You cut my hair.

641
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,623
This sword could skin you alive.

642
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:20,620
But you told me I was safe.

643
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:23,226
And you were.
Entirely safe.

644
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:25,948
I gave you my word.

645
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:29,788
Now I will take this.

646
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:49,265
Miss Everdene.

647
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,464
Perhaps I could walk with you?

648
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:55,106
I'm quite happy
to walk by myself.

649
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:59,427
You should have nothing
to do with him.

650
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:01,782
He's not good enough for you.

651
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:04,388
He's a perfectly decent man.

652
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:06,906
That's not what I believe.

653
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:09,586
Why? What have you heard?

654
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:14,422
You don't know him at all.
It's all rumors.

655
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:16,380
Prejudice simply because
he's a soldier.

656
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:18,900
I like soldiers.
But not this one.

657
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:21,426
I believe him to have
no conscience at all.

658
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:24,827
Stay clear.
Don't listen to him.

659
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:26,584
Don't believe him.

660
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:28,271
Get rid of him.

661
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,469
And what is it to you?

662
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:35,184
I'm not such a fool
as to imagine

663
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:38,230
I might stand a chance now
that you are so above me.

664
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:42,146
But don't suppose I'm content
to stay a nobody all my life.

665
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:45,271
One day I will leave you.
You can be sure of that.

666
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:47,948
But for now,
I care for you too much

667
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:50,341
to see you go to ruin
because of him.

668
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:55,144
So if you don't mind, I'll...

669
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:59,262
I'll stay by your side.

670
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:03,462
Good evening.

671
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:23,382
<i>Mr. Boldwood,</i>

672
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:26,430
<i>you have been a dear friend
to me these past months.</i>

673
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,787
<i>And it is because
I value our friendship</i>

674
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:31,306
<i>so greatly that I am writing.</i>

675
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:35,024
<i>I am honored by your proposal</i>

676
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:37,302
<i>and have given it much thought,</i>

677
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,787
<i>but I must tell you that,
to my own surprise,</i>

678
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:42,067
<i>I have undergone
what can only be described</i>

679
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:44,507
<i>as a change of heart</i>

680
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:47,345
<i>and I'm afraid
I cannot accept your offer.</i>

681
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:13,066
I wasn't sure you'd be here.

682
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,587
Where else would I be?

683
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:19,704
You ready?

684
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:24,023
Are you sure?

685
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:30,542
How does this sound?

686
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:34,385
Mrs. Bathsheba Troy.

687
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,431
All right?

688
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:49,464
Walk on.

689
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:40,263
Gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen.

690
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:46,309
A short time ago,
I had the privilege

691
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:52,187
and the simple fortune
of meeting this angel.

692
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:54,550
Your mistress.

693
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:58,543
And now I stand before
you her husband,

694
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:00,911
your master,

695
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:04,825
and the proudest man
you will ever see.

696
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:09,385
So, please, charge your glasses

697
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:14,387
and sing out to
my most beautiful wife,

698
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:18,741
Mrs. Bathsheba Troy.

699
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:27,829
Miss Everdene,
there's going to be a storm.

700
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:31,740
Oak, you big lump.
To me.

701
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:33,743
There's going to be a storm.

702
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:36,983
We need to protect the ricks
or we'll lose the harvest.

703
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:39,981
I need five to six men
for an hour, no more.

704
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:41,784
Frank, perhaps we ought to...
No.

705
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:43,510
Darling, it's our
wedding celebration.

706
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:48,984
It will not rain tonight.
My wife forbids it.

707
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:51,628
Now if you'll excuse me.

708
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:54,463
Friends!

709
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:56,341
One more thing.

710
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:02,302
I may no longer
be Sergeant Troy,

711
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:06,391
But I remain a soldier
in this one respect!

712
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:11,301
The finest bottles
of French brandy,

713
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:15,509
a triple-strength dose
for every man.

714
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:16,781
Cheers! To your health!

715
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:02,347
<i>"Pretty Polly, Pretty Polly
It's I've come a-wooin"'</i>

716
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:08,066
<i>"Pretty Polly, Pretty Polly
It's I've come a-wooin"'</i>

717
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:12,065
<i>She says, "Creep and crawl
through the window, then</i>

718
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:14,024
<i>"And let's get doin'</i>

719
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:18,628
<i>"And lay your leg over me
Over me, do</i>

720
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:24,300

and I cannot undo 'em</i>

721
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:32,147
<i>"There's a knife
on the windowsill</i>

722
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:33,745
<i>"Love, take it to 'em</i>

723
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,951
<i>"And lay your leg over me..."</i>

724
01:09:56,300 --> 01:10:01,022
<i>About 40 weeks after,
the fine baby come bawlin'</i>

725
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:06,589
<i>Never regretted
that creepin' and crawlin'</i>

726
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:09,829
<i>"Lay your leg over me
Over me..."</i>

727
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:59,145
Gabriel!

728
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:02,821
Gabriel!

729
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,266
What can I do?

730
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:08,269
It's too dangerous!

731
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:09,865
I'm coming up!

732
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:21,266
Hold it down.

733
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,389
Still no rain.

734
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:26,504
It'll come.

735
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:44,464
Come on, hold me!
Come here. Come here.

736
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:52,228
Come here. Come on.

737
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,982
Gabriel, I've been a fool.

738
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:19,142
I've always had contempt
for silly girls

739
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:22,582
dazzled by flattery
in a scarlet uniform and...

740
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:25,790
And now I've done
what I swore I would never do.

741
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:30,466
But he told me
about another woman,

742
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:33,627
a woman more beautiful
that he'd loved before,

743
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:35,589
and I couldn't bear it.

744
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,343
So somewhere between
jealousy and distraction,

745
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:40,546
I married him.

746
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:43,990
I don't want an opinion
on the subject, I just...

747
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,423
In fact, I forbid it.

748
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:53,191
Go to bed.

749
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:56,821
I'll finish it on my own.

750
01:12:57,820 --> 01:12:59,504
Gabriel...

751
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:04,710
Thank you.

752
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:30,986
Sir?

753
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:36,506
Mr. Boldwood, sir!

754
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:40,429
I wanted to ensure your
mistress' crops were safe.

755
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:43,545
Good work, Gabriel.
She's lucky to have you.

756
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:46,509
Wait a moment, sir.

757
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:55,866
You seem unwell, sir.

758
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:58,344
You should go home.

759
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:01,261
Yes.

760
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:06,188
Yes, I will.

761
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:12,825
Oak.

762
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:18,029
You know that things have
not gone well with me, lately.

763
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:23,625
I was going to get a little
settled in life. But, er...

764
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:29,662
It was not to be.

765
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:34,907
I daresay I'm something of a...

766
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:37,902
A joke about the parish.

767
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:42,307
But I do wanna make
one thing clear.

768
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:45,824
There was no jilting
on her part.

769
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:51,548
We were never engaged.
No matter what people say.

770
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:55,063
She promised me nothing.

771
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:02,589
And yet,

772
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:04,670
Gabriel,

773
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:11,466
I feel the most terrible grief.

774
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:20,222
Not a word to her.

775
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:23,911
We understand each other, yes?

776
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:27,061
Yes, sir.

777
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:20,267
Damn and bother!

778
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:25,190
Sit.

779
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:27,741
Stay. Now, turn around.

780
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:35,106
Can you spare a coin, please?

781
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:36,500
No, no.

782
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:41,951
Hit him!

783
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,501
Come on!

784
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:46,584
Knock him out!

785
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:49,504
Hit him!

786
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:56,587
Pay up.
Pay up, Mr. Troy.

787
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:59,104
Just take it.

788
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:05,901
Sir, excuse me.

789
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:07,630
Could you spare a coin, please?

790
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:09,545
No.

791
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:13,261
Fanny?

792
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:22,471
Hello, Frank.

793
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:26,145
Hello.

794
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:29,826
You're so pale.

795
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:31,786
Oh, Frank.

796
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:34,022
Darling, your hands are shaking.

797
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:37,510
I thought you said
All Souls, not All Saints.

798
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:39,582
I went to the wrong church.

799
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:44,705
When I got there, you'd gone.
And I don't blame you,

800
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:47,181
but it's been very hard,
Frank. I...

801
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:48,591
Not now.

802
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:52,067
My wife mustn't see you.

803
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:54,111
Your wife?

804
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:07,227
Mrs. Troy is very beautiful.

805
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:10,624
No more than you.

806
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:17,743
Frank, I must tell you,
I'm carrying your child.

807
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:19,345
What?

808
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:34,703
What if I told you that
I'd made a terrible mistake,

809
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:38,507
but that I will make amends?

810
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:40,871
I swear on my life

811
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:43,830
I will find a home
for you and our baby.

812
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:46,103
You've sworn before, Frank.

813
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:48,143
No, this time... This time...

814
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:58,391
Go to Budmouth.
Stay at the Union.

815
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:00,349
The workhouse, Frank?

816
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:02,263
Tonight, just tonight.
One night.

817
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:05,184
And then meet me tomorrow
at 10:00 on the bridge.

818
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:07,702
I'll bring you
all the money I have

819
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:09,191
and I'll find a home for you.

820
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:11,349
You'll be safe, my darling.

821
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:14,867
And I promise you, I promise you

822
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:17,028
I will make amends.

823
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:24,024
Get back in the carriage.

824
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:26,269
Do you know who that woman is?

825
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:27,741
I do.

826
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:29,186
Who is she?

827
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:30,466
She's nothing.

828
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:33,708
Get back in the carriage.

829
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:36,025
Frank...

830
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:47,871
Could you let me have £20?

831
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:51,950
What for?

832
01:20:52,660 --> 01:20:54,230
I need it.

833
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:59,344
If you continue to gamble,
we will lose the farm.

834
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:00,541
It's not for gambling.

835
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:01,781
What's it for?

836
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:03,021
Why should it matter
what it's for?

837
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:04,431
It's my money.

838
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:07,028
I work for it, don't I?

839
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:09,671
No. You don't.

840
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:12,582
Not proper farm work.

841
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:16,906
Don't do something
you'll regret.

842
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:22,821
The money is required
for farm expenses.

843
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:11,344
No mistake, Mr. Oak.

844
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:14,071
This was Miss Robbin's
last known abode.

845
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:15,346
Fanny was
my uncle's servant

846
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:17,149
and we shall treat
her with respect.

847
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:20,188
Perhaps we should
take her to the church,

848
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:21,750
just for tonight.

849
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:24,187
No, bring her inside, please.

850
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:46,504
What did she die of, Liddy?

851
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:49,949
I don't know, miss.

852
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:53,824
There were rumors, but...

853
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:57,311
Fanny had a sweetheart,
didn't she?

854
01:22:57,780 --> 01:22:59,384
Yes, miss.

855
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:02,623
A soldier.

856
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:09,464
Please, come
and sit upstairs with me.

857
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:29,743
I seem to cry
a great deal these days.

858
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:33,865
I never used to cry at all.

859
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:45,461
Good night, Liddy.

860
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,389
'Night, miss.

861
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:45,785
What?

862
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:47,466
Who is it?

863
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:48,991
I can't say...

864
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:50,630
Stay, stay. Stay.

865
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:12,622
Don't kiss them, Frank.

866
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:15,381
I'm still your wife.

867
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:25,870
This woman, dead as she is,

868
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:31,868
is more to me than you
ever were, or are, or can be.

869
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:36,468
You are nothing to me now.

870
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:40,669
Nothing.

871
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:50,262
Mrs. Troy?

872
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:55,788
I'm afraid...

873
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:58,306
I'm afraid your
husband has drowned.

874
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:33,381
That's a great
responsibility, sir.

875
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:34,461
Nonsense.

876
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:35,905
No reason why a man
of your ability

877
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:38,506
shouldn't be able to
superintend two farms.

878
01:29:38,660 --> 01:29:39,866
And why shouldn't there
be stronger links

879
01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:41,590
between our establishments?

880
01:29:41,660 --> 01:29:45,346
Think of it. Two thousand
acres under your sole charge.

881
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:47,469
A share of my profits.

882
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:48,661
Miss Everdene needs me here.

883
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:50,151
And her farm will have priority.

884
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:51,631
I'd still need
Miss Everdene's permission.

885
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:52,781
But, of course.

886
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:54,021
Of course, I wouldn't
dare do anything

887
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:55,829
without her blessing. And,

888
01:29:55,940 --> 01:29:58,511
if it'll help
sway your decision,

889
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:05,266
there's an old comrade
of yours here.

890
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:08,221
Georgie!

891
01:30:08,380 --> 01:30:09,541
Had to go all the way
to Norcombe Hill

892
01:30:09,620 --> 01:30:10,667
to find this old fella.

893
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:12,021
You pleased?

894
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:14,064
Yes, sir, very much.

895
01:30:14,180 --> 01:30:17,024
And I'll have your
decision soon, yes?

896
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:18,985
You will, sir.

897
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:21,029
Hey, Georgie.

898
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:24,101
Come on. Come on.

899
01:30:35,460 --> 01:30:36,905
Come on! Come on!

900
01:30:38,740 --> 01:30:41,220
Gabriel, you're
getting on in the world.

901
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:43,908
Of course you must
accept the offer.

902
01:30:44,020 --> 01:30:46,148
Only with
your approval.

903
01:30:46,460 --> 01:30:48,269
If I lose the farm,
there may be no future

904
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:50,388
for any of us here.

905
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:53,067
You know where my loyalty lies.

906
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:57,662
You're a man of great talent.

907
01:30:57,980 --> 01:30:59,311
It's only natural
that you should rise.

908
01:30:59,380 --> 01:31:01,621
I've no desire to hold you back.

909
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:13,826
Thank you.

910
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:21,302
Come on, Georgie.
Come on.

911
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:30,591
Forgive me.
I understand there are debts.

912
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:33,624
Your late husband.

913
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:37,505
Perhaps... Perhaps we should
change the subject.

914
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:39,264
Perhaps I can help.

915
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:46,550
Mr. Boldwood,
that's a very kind offer,

916
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:49,146
but I would never dream
of accepting any money.

917
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:55,781
I am a middle-aged man

918
01:31:57,340 --> 01:32:00,628
willing to protect you
for the rest of your life.

919
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:06,786
You may run your farm,
if you wish. Without risk.

920
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:10,630
I'll pay your

921
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:13,782
departed husband's debts

922
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:16,062
and guarantee
its financial stability.

923
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:19,627
It can be your pastime.

924
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:24,585
Of course, we'd need to wait,

925
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:27,108
for propriety's sake.

926
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:29,584
But when you're ready,

927
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:32,508
I'm offering you shelter.

928
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:37,545
Comfort. A safe harbor.

929
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:42,384
As my wife.

930
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:49,187
You must at least admire
my persistence.

931
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:53,586
I do.

932
01:32:53,660 --> 01:32:54,661
And like me?

933
01:32:54,740 --> 01:32:55,821
Yes.

934
01:32:57,020 --> 01:32:59,421
And respect me?

935
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:01,468
Yes. Very much.

936
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:03,861
Which is it?
Like or respect?

937
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:10,549
It is difficult for a woman
to define her feelings

938
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:13,226
in a language chiefly
made by men to express theirs.

939
01:33:13,340 --> 01:33:16,184
If you worry about a lack
of passion on your part,

940
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:17,864
a lack of, er,

941
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:21,990
desire,

942
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:25,546
if you worry about marrying me

943
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:28,544
merely out of guilt,

944
01:33:28,860 --> 01:33:30,464
and, er,

945
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:35,624
pity and compromise, well...

946
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:38,504
I don't mind.

947
01:33:42,740 --> 01:33:44,469
When must you
give your answer?

948
01:33:44,580 --> 01:33:46,184
By Christmas.

949
01:33:48,020 --> 01:33:49,863
It's a terrible responsibility.

950
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:54,946
I hold that man's
future in my hands.

951
01:33:55,580 --> 01:33:57,708
His sanity, too, perhaps.

952
01:33:57,780 --> 01:33:59,066
Could you care for him?

953
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:01,507
You may suppose
love is wanting.

954
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:06,429
But love's a worn-out,
miserable thing for me now.

955
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:08,548
Why are you
asking me?

956
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:15,586
I need someone who's objective.

957
01:34:15,660 --> 01:34:17,264
Indifferent.

958
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:21,550
Then I'm afraid you're
asking the wrong man.

959
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:41,504
Good evening, Mr. Oak.

960
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:44,670
Good evening.

961
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:04,141
That's it.

962
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:05,347
Mind.

963
01:35:15,620 --> 01:35:21,104
<i>Rejoice</i>

964
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:25,185
<i>Emmanuel</i>

965
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:28,065
<i>Shall come to thee</i>

966
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:33,107
<i>O Israel</i>

967
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:40,225
<i>O come, Thou Rod of Jesse...</i>

968
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:43,347
I appreciate you
coming along, Oak.

969
01:35:43,420 --> 01:35:44,421
Ah!

970
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:46,901
Yes, very good.
Well done. Erm...

971
01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:48,027
Just more... More things.

972
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:49,181
Yes, sir.

973
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:56,583
So what do you think?

974
01:35:57,180 --> 01:35:59,865
I'm not in the habit of
organizing parties.

975
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:02,580
Perhaps we should make it
an annual event.

976
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:03,786
Every Christmas Eve.

977
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:05,865
I've invited the whole village.

978
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:07,021
Do you think they'll come?

979
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:09,102
Do you think
Miss Everdene will come?

980
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:10,745
I'm sure she will.

981
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:13,021
Yes.

982
01:36:13,780 --> 01:36:15,782
And you'll come too, I hope.

983
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:19,506
I know Miss Everdene
would like you to be here.

984
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:21,025
Perhaps, for an hour or so.

985
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:29,502
Look, I'm shaking.
I'm so nervous.

986
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:32,662
Gabriel, will you...

987
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:34,306
As well as you can, please.

988
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:35,825
I'll try.

989
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:38,904
Is there a knot that's
particularly fashionable?

990
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:43,028
You're asking the wrong man.

991
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:46,031
What about women?

992
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:49,102
Does a woman keep her promise?

993
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:51,984
She has promised?

994
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:54,742
An implied promise.

995
01:36:56,620 --> 01:36:58,031
Once again, I'm...

996
01:36:58,180 --> 01:36:59,545
Will she do what's right?

997
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:04,143
If it's not inconvenient to her.

998
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:07,467
Oak, you've become
quite cynical lately.

999
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:10,224
She never promised
that first time.

1000
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:13,702
Therefore, she has
never broken her promise.

1001
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:16,501
She hasn't promised
this time, either.

1002
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:20,828
But she will. Tonight.

1003
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:22,825
I know she will.

1004
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:26,270
And when she does...

1005
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:35,866
I wanted to tell you
in advance, Gabriel,

1006
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:40,424
because I... I believe
I know your secret.

1007
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:46,186
I've seen you together.

1008
01:37:47,620 --> 01:37:49,702
The way you speak to her.

1009
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:52,430
And watch her.

1010
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:56,148
And look after her.

1011
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:58,781
And I know her, er,

1012
01:38:00,220 --> 01:38:03,747
profound affection for you.

1013
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:06,587
You've behaved like a man,

1014
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:08,831
and as the successful rival,

1015
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:11,983
successful through
your kindness,

1016
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:13,061
I wish to tell you

1017
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:17,861
I am profoundly grateful.

1018
01:38:22,300 --> 01:38:24,871
The cook would like a word, sir.

1019
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:35,068
Kiss me. Joseph.

1020
01:39:35,140 --> 01:39:37,142
No, please don't.
Liddy, don't.

1021
01:40:00,700 --> 01:40:02,429
Would you excuse me?

1022
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:10,109
I've come to say good night.

1023
01:40:10,220 --> 01:40:12,427
Go back and talk to
the poor things.

1024
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:14,582
You've broken their hearts.

1025
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:17,501
I don't suit
this kind of affair.

1026
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:20,781
No. Nor do I.

1027
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:23,908
I wish I could go, too.

1028
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:34,746
I must go.

1029
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:37,750
Not before you've danced.
Both of you.

1030
01:40:37,860 --> 01:40:39,225
I insist.

1031
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:44,470
Mr. Oak?

1032
01:40:46,940 --> 01:40:48,430
Thank you.

1033
01:41:16,980 --> 01:41:18,982
Tell me what to do.

1034
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:25,305
Gabriel?

1035
01:41:32,580 --> 01:41:34,423
Do what is right.

1036
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:40,109
Sorry, excuse me.

1037
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:26,945
Frank.

1038
01:42:28,420 --> 01:42:30,548
Black suits you.

1039
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:34,462
Although a little premature.

1040
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:41,543
You're alive.

1041
01:42:42,140 --> 01:42:45,826
And here I am.
Pulled from the sea.

1042
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:49,422
Some fishermen found me
and brought me to shore.

1043
01:42:50,260 --> 01:42:52,661
Then I discovered I was dead
and found I preferred it.

1044
01:42:54,860 --> 01:42:56,510
For a while, anyway.

1045
01:42:56,780 --> 01:42:58,384
Why have you come back?

1046
01:42:58,540 --> 01:43:00,110
The strangest thing.

1047
01:43:01,340 --> 01:43:03,069
I missed you.

1048
01:43:04,740 --> 01:43:07,220
You don't seem very
happy to see me.

1049
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:09,901
You said I was nothing to you.

1050
01:43:10,220 --> 01:43:11,585
Did I?

1051
01:43:13,340 --> 01:43:17,789
Well, then.
Honesty at all times.

1052
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:21,464
I find myself in need of money.

1053
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:23,831
I gave up my profession for you,

1054
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:25,664
and it seems a little harsh

1055
01:43:25,820 --> 01:43:27,060
that you have a farm and a house

1056
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:29,182
while I'm living off nothing.

1057
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:30,751
There is no money.

1058
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:32,311
Then sell the farm.

1059
01:43:44,140 --> 01:43:45,505
Come home.

1060
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:51,745
No.

1061
01:43:53,860 --> 01:43:57,148
I said, come home.

1062
01:43:59,180 --> 01:44:01,786
I'm your husband
and you'll obey me!

1063
01:44:18,620 --> 01:44:20,031
Oh, my God.

1064
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:51,150
Let me see.

1065
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:54,981
If it's
any consolation,

1066
01:45:55,060 --> 01:45:56,903
his life will be spared.

1067
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:00,429
Crime of passion.

1068
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:28,945
Morning, Liddy.

1069
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:33,029
It's a
fine harvest, ma'am.

1070
01:46:33,100 --> 01:46:34,590
Best we've had in years.

1071
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:36,260
Will we have it all over
before the dew?

1072
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:39,702
We will indeed, ma'am.
Luck's been on our side.

1073
01:46:45,540 --> 01:46:48,749
Come, Liddy, give me a hand.

1074
01:47:14,260 --> 01:47:16,422
I'm sorry I startled you.

1075
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:19,585
I wanted to tidy up for them.

1076
01:47:19,660 --> 01:47:21,788
I haven't been here for so long.

1077
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:26,504
Are you going in?

1078
01:47:27,020 --> 01:47:30,183
Rehearsals.
I sing bass in the choir.

1079
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:32,303
Yes, I've heard you.

1080
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:35,425
Then I apologize.

1081
01:47:39,140 --> 01:47:41,984
I've been hoping to get
a chance to talk to you.

1082
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:46,546
We've... We've not spoken
as much as I'd have liked.

1083
01:47:47,700 --> 01:47:49,031
No.

1084
01:47:57,700 --> 01:47:59,941
I'm leaving England.

1085
01:48:03,860 --> 01:48:05,385
Leaving?

1086
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:08,662
Going to America.

1087
01:48:09,620 --> 01:48:12,146
There's a boat leaving
Bristol in four days' time.

1088
01:48:12,220 --> 01:48:13,710
I'll be on it.

1089
01:48:14,180 --> 01:48:15,864
Now that the farm is secure.

1090
01:48:17,060 --> 01:48:19,904
I understand I should
give you notice.

1091
01:48:22,060 --> 01:48:25,223
No. You must go
when you want.

1092
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:32,141
I'll leave first thing tomorrow.

1093
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:33,710
No fuss.

1094
01:48:35,540 --> 01:48:36,871
I think that's best.

1095
01:50:24,140 --> 01:50:25,187
Gabriel!

1096
01:50:30,660 --> 01:50:31,991
Gabriel.

1097
01:50:32,860 --> 01:50:34,271
Wait.

1098
01:50:51,940 --> 01:50:53,988
You'll think I'm strange, but...

1099
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:57,787
I've been worried.
Have I offended you somehow?

1100
01:50:57,900 --> 01:50:59,470
No, not at all.

1101
01:51:00,700 --> 01:51:02,304
Is it money?

1102
01:51:03,220 --> 01:51:04,904
I'll pay you whatever you want.

1103
01:51:05,020 --> 01:51:06,829
I don't need money now.

1104
01:51:07,860 --> 01:51:09,350
A formal partnership, then?

1105
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:11,025
Nor a partnership.

1106
01:51:12,020 --> 01:51:14,227
The farm belongs to you alone.

1107
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:16,661
It's the finest farm
for miles around.

1108
01:51:16,740 --> 01:51:18,822
Then why else are you leaving?

1109
01:51:18,900 --> 01:51:20,823
I said I'd leave you one day.

1110
01:51:24,860 --> 01:51:27,261
Well, you must not go.

1111
01:51:28,180 --> 01:51:29,420
You forbid me?

1112
01:51:29,580 --> 01:51:30,866
Yes, if you like.

1113
01:51:31,580 --> 01:51:33,105
I forbid you.

1114
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:38,424
It's time for you
to fight your own battles.

1115
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:41,024
And win them, too.

1116
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:46,068
So we should
say good-bye, then?

1117
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:49,264
I suppose so.

1118
01:51:59,940 --> 01:52:01,271
Gabriel, wait.

1119
01:52:06,060 --> 01:52:07,789
Thank you, Gabriel.

1120
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:11,907
You've believed in me
and fought for me

1121
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:13,900
and stood by my side when

1122
01:52:13,940 --> 01:52:16,591
all the rest of the world
is against me.

1123
01:52:18,540 --> 01:52:20,986
And we've been through
so much together.

1124
01:52:25,620 --> 01:52:27,748
Wasn't I your first sweetheart?

1125
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:32,149
Weren't you mine?

1126
01:52:38,380 --> 01:52:41,145
And now I'd have to
go on without you.

1127
01:52:45,620 --> 01:52:47,622
If I knew...

1128
01:52:52,660 --> 01:52:54,105
If I knew that you would

1129
01:52:54,180 --> 01:52:56,911
let me love you and marry you...

1130
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:58,784
But you will never know.

1131
01:53:00,780 --> 01:53:02,270
Why not?

1132
01:53:03,460 --> 01:53:05,827
Because you never ask!

1133
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:08,343
Would you say no again?

1134
01:53:10,300 --> 01:53:11,631
I don't know.

1135
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:15,030
Probably.

1136
01:53:21,940 --> 01:53:23,783
So why don't you?

1137
01:53:25,540 --> 01:53:27,190
Ask me.

1138
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:32,950
Ask me.

1139
01:53:37,540 --> 01:53:38,951
Ask me, Gabriel.

1140
01:56:26,540 --> 01:56:32,229
<i>Come all you fair
and tender girls</i>

1141
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:38,148
<i>That flourish in your prime</i>

1142
01:56:38,220 --> 01:56:44,148
<i>Beware, beware
Keep your garden fair</i>

1143
01:56:44,220 --> 01:56:49,220
<i>Let no man steal your thyme</i>

1144
01:56:57,540 --> 01:57:03,183
<i>For when your thyme
it is past and gone</i>

1145
01:57:03,260 --> 01:57:09,347
<i>He'll care no more for you</i>

1146
01:57:09,420 --> 01:57:11,661
<i>And every place</i>

1147
01:57:11,740 --> 01:57:15,426
<i>Where your thyme was waste</i>

1148
01:57:15,540 --> 01:57:20,540
<i>Will all spread o'er with rue</i>

1149
01:57:27,740 --> 01:57:33,349
<i>The gardener's son
was standing by</i>

1150
01:57:33,460 --> 01:57:39,183
<i>Three flowers he gave to me</i>

1151
01:57:39,300 --> 01:57:45,148
<i>The pink, the blue
and the violet true</i>

1152
01:57:45,220 --> 01:57:50,220
<i>And the red, red rosy tree</i>

1153
01:57:57,460 --> 01:58:02,466
<i>But I refused the red rose bush</i>

1154
01:58:03,420 --> 01:58:08,631
<i>And gained the willow tree</i>

1155
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:14,460
<i>That all the world
may plainly see</i>

1156
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:20,943
<i>How my love slighted me</i>

1157
01:58:22,940 --> 01:58:28,504
<i>How my love slighted me</i>
