I just...

188
00:15:47,637 --> 00:15:50,039
I just knew you wouldn’t lend it to me for that,

189
00:15:50,072 --> 00:15:52,442
and I had nowhere else to go.

190
00:15:53,443 --> 00:15:55,745
How do you know what I would’ve done?

191
00:15:55,778 --> 00:15:56,913
I’m a woman.

192
00:15:56,946 --> 00:15:58,815
I watch "The View."

193
00:16:02,952 --> 00:16:04,120
Where’s his daddy?

194
00:16:04,153 --> 00:16:06,155
His real daddy.

195
00:16:06,189 --> 00:16:07,957
What was his name?

196
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,926
Chip? Chuck?

197
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,561
Chet.

198
00:16:11,594 --> 00:16:12,663
Chet.

199
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,132
Last I heard, he was

200
00:16:15,165 --> 00:16:17,301
holed up drunk and high in that same shithole

201
00:16:17,334 --> 00:16:19,469
trailer we used to live in.

202
00:16:19,502 --> 00:16:21,637
And the one who done all that to you?

203
00:16:24,675 --> 00:16:25,676
No.

204
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:27,744
I know what you’re thinkin', Tess.

205
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,112
Tommy is different.

206
00:16:29,145 --> 00:16:30,781
He was good,

207
00:16:30,814 --> 00:16:32,149
and he is good.

208
00:16:32,182 --> 00:16:34,852
He’s really good when he’s not drinkin'.

209
00:16:34,885 --> 00:16:38,255
Yeah, I saw that big ol’ diamond ring on your finger.

210
00:16:40,591 --> 00:16:42,627
He loves me,

211
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,263
and he loves Kipp.

212
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:48,131
He insisted on adopting Kipp right after we got married.

213
00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:49,600
Chet didn’t even put up a fight.

214
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:52,770
Then one day out of the blue, Tommy just smacks you a good one

215
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,304
on his way to feed the homeless.

216
00:16:55,907 --> 00:16:57,709
That what happened, Murel?

217
00:16:57,742 --> 00:16:58,743
Hm?

218
00:17:00,512 --> 00:17:02,080
And the boy?

219
00:17:02,113 --> 00:17:04,282
Does his new daddy beat him?

220
00:17:05,116 --> 00:17:06,150
No.

221
00:17:06,184 --> 00:17:07,385
Hell no.

222
00:17:07,418 --> 00:17:10,189
I’d kill him if he ever laid a hand on him.

223
00:17:10,222 --> 00:17:12,290
What’s the police say about all this?

224
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,792
They don’t see me as nothing but a kooky bird.

225
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:16,794
[sighs]

226
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,731
So where you gonna go?

227
00:17:22,568 --> 00:17:24,102
Hell, I just wanna go somewhere

228
00:17:24,135 --> 00:17:25,871
there’s a crowd I can get lost in.

229
00:17:25,905 --> 00:17:26,872
Hm.

230
00:17:53,165 --> 00:17:54,300
[Murel] What is this?

231
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,869
-[Kipp] The sun. -[Murel] Oh, yeah?

232
00:17:55,902 --> 00:17:57,137
[Kipp] It’s like... [hums]

233
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,238
somewhere.

234
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,040
From California.

235
00:18:00,073 --> 00:18:02,409
[hums]

236
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:05,045
And what’s this?

237
00:18:05,078 --> 00:18:07,180
A seashell from California.

238
00:18:07,214 --> 00:18:09,549
[hums]

239
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,818
We’re invading the picture.

240
00:18:11,851 --> 00:18:13,987
-We’re invading the picture. -That’s the beach.

241
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,122
Good.

242
00:18:15,156 --> 00:18:16,656
I don’t even know what a mussel is though.

243
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,560
When we get to California, we’ll go find one.

244
00:18:20,594 --> 00:18:22,563
How about we put this stuff up now?

245
00:18:22,597 --> 00:18:23,397
No.

246
00:18:23,431 --> 00:18:24,865
Put your ship in.

247
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:27,335
-Okay. -There you go.

248
00:18:27,368 --> 00:18:29,604
I’m a little bit nervous about the earthquakes.

249
00:18:29,637 --> 00:18:32,239
They say it isn’t if, it’s when, you know.

250
00:18:32,273 --> 00:18:34,308
Oh. Well...

251
00:18:34,342 --> 00:18:36,344
don’t you worry, baby boy.

252
00:18:36,377 --> 00:18:38,613
We’ll get us a house on roller skates,

253
00:18:38,646 --> 00:18:41,983
and when the big one comes, we’ll just roll all around.

254
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:44,352
[both laugh]

255
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:53,495
Sweetheart, Kipp...

256
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,564
has Daddy ever hit you?

257
00:18:58,233 --> 00:19:00,469
No, Mama. Why?

258
00:19:02,604 --> 00:19:03,738
Good.

259
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:11,546
Eskimo kiss?

260
00:19:16,052 --> 00:19:17,854
So, till...

261
00:19:17,886 --> 00:19:21,289
[both] jellyfish walk and turtles fly,

262
00:19:21,323 --> 00:19:24,827
unicorns fart and eat booger pies,

263
00:19:24,861 --> 00:19:29,465
till gators drive cars and dolphins take flight,

264
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:31,868
I love you, I love you

265
00:19:31,901 --> 00:19:35,172
-till morning. Good night. -I love... morning. Good night.

266
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:36,973
[kisses] Oh!

267
00:19:37,006 --> 00:19:39,042
What was that?

268
00:19:39,075 --> 00:19:40,610
What the heck?

269
00:19:41,444 --> 00:19:42,846
Was that your tongue?

270
00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:45,015
Gross! Ew!

271
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:47,084
-Ew! -[laughs]

272
00:19:47,117 --> 00:19:48,851
Yuck!

273
00:19:48,885 --> 00:19:50,788
Inappropriate!

274
00:19:50,821 --> 00:19:52,922
-[laughing] -You don’t do that with your mom.

275
00:19:52,955 --> 00:19:54,625
It’s gross, okay?

276
00:19:54,658 --> 00:19:56,426
You save that for your girlfriend

277
00:19:56,459 --> 00:19:59,062
when you’re... 30.

278
00:19:59,096 --> 00:20:01,765
Ah, ah, ah.

279
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:02,834
Good night.

280
00:20:02,866 --> 00:20:06,003
And no more with that tongue. Bleck.

281
00:20:07,938 --> 00:20:09,073
Good night.

282
00:20:09,106 --> 00:20:10,708
I love you.

283
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,342
[chiming, purring]

284
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,444
[phone rings]

285
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:52,618
Hey.

286
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,420
[Tommy] Where the hell you been?

287
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,590
You just up and disappeared.

288
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,458
You beat the hell out of me again, Tommy.

289
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:00,526
What’d you expect?

290
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,994
I didn’t mean it.

291
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,830
Can I help it if I’m passionate?

292
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:07,634
I just got carried away in the heat of the moment.

293
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:10,003
Yeah?

294
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:14,140
You say that every time.

295
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:15,175
What?

296
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,010
Don’t be all dramatic now.

297
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,613
I said I didn’t mean it.

298
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:24,751
Come on home, baby.

299
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:30,557
Tommy, have you ever hit Kipp?

300
00:21:32,426 --> 00:21:33,927
Tommy?

301
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:36,997
Tommy, are you still there?

302
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:41,802
It was an accident, Murel.

303
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:44,872
We were boxing. I was...

304
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,608
showing him how to protect himself.

305
00:21:47,642 --> 00:21:49,911
He didn’t duck when I told him to.

306
00:21:49,944 --> 00:21:50,912
Tommy.

307
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,650
I’m trying to teach him how to be a man, Murel.

308
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:58,119
You’re always babying him.

309
00:21:59,654 --> 00:22:00,954
I knew you’d overreact.

310
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,957
That’s why I told him not to tell you.

311
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,425
[scoffs]

312
00:22:04,459 --> 00:22:06,928
You gotta tell me this stuff.

313
00:22:06,961 --> 00:22:09,063
There can’t be secrets between us.

314
00:22:09,096 --> 00:22:10,665
I know, baby. I’m sorry.

315
00:22:12,334 --> 00:22:14,603
Tell Kipp I’m sorry too.

316
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:17,972
If he comes home,

317
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:20,942
I’ll get him that puppy he’s been wantin'.

318
00:22:20,975 --> 00:22:26,214
A golden retriever, a lab, pit bull, whatever he wants.

319
00:22:29,218 --> 00:22:30,985
I got you somethin’ too, baby.

320
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:33,554
You did?

321
00:22:33,588 --> 00:22:34,823
Somethin’ sexy.

322
00:22:34,857 --> 00:22:36,258
[chuckles]

323
00:22:37,326 --> 00:22:38,660
[Tess] Give me that phone!

324
00:22:38,694 --> 00:22:40,230
You listen to me.

325
00:22:40,263 --> 00:22:42,798
You stay away from her and don’t you ever come near her

326
00:22:42,831 --> 00:22:44,466
or that boy again, do you hear me?

327
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,468
Do you hear me?

328
00:22:46,501 --> 00:22:48,971
-Turn this damn thing off. -[beep]

329
00:23:16,499 --> 00:23:17,834
Who is it?

330
00:23:19,135 --> 00:23:20,336
[knocking continues]

331
00:23:24,575 --> 00:23:26,543
Randall?

332
00:23:26,577 --> 00:23:28,312
Sorry to wake you, Tess.

333
00:23:28,344 --> 00:23:30,481
What the hell do you want so early?

334
00:23:30,514 --> 00:23:31,548
Can I come in?

335
00:23:31,582 --> 00:23:33,317
I guess so.

336
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:34,485
I wasn’t asleep.

337
00:23:34,518 --> 00:23:36,420
I was making coffee. You want some?

338
00:23:36,453 --> 00:23:38,856
Yeah, coffee’d be great. Thanks.

339
00:23:42,761 --> 00:23:47,165
So you know anything about a broke down Ford Extended Cab

340
00:23:47,198 --> 00:23:48,565
out on Highway 81?

341
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,701
Good grief.

342
00:23:49,734 --> 00:23:52,203
Every other car in Oklahoma is a pickup.

343
00:23:52,237 --> 00:23:54,673
Is that how come you came pounding on my door

344
00:23:54,706 --> 00:23:55,806
at the crack of dawn?

345
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:58,043
Well, this one here, it belongs to a man

346
00:23:58,076 --> 00:23:59,210
over in Cashion.

347
00:23:59,244 --> 00:24:00,278
We got a...

348
00:24:00,312 --> 00:24:03,580
got an Amber Alert out on it. A child abduction.

349
00:24:03,614 --> 00:24:05,417
Child abduction?

350
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,718
Yeah. A mama...

351
00:24:06,751 --> 00:24:09,354
took her son and run off.

352
00:24:09,387 --> 00:24:10,854
Her own son?

353
00:24:11,756 --> 00:24:13,892
Since when is that child abduction?

354
00:24:13,925 --> 00:24:15,460
It sounds more like a weekend getaway

355
00:24:15,493 --> 00:24:17,730
from a no good husband to me.

356
00:24:17,762 --> 00:24:19,398
[door closes]

357
00:24:19,432 --> 00:24:21,199
Who is that?

358
00:24:21,232 --> 00:24:23,668
Yeah, that’s my new partner, Conley.

359
00:24:23,702 --> 00:24:25,237
She’s just up from the city.

360
00:24:25,271 --> 00:24:27,674
Hm. Yeah, New York City.

361
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:30,576
Well, Officer Conley, welcome to my home.

362
00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:32,111
[whispers] Wake up, baby.

363
00:24:32,144 --> 00:24:33,846
Wake up. Wake up.

364
00:24:33,879 --> 00:24:35,115
Shh!

365
00:24:35,148 --> 00:24:37,049
[Tess] That would be my husband, Bob.

366
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:39,151
I expect you’ve heard a lot about him

367
00:24:39,185 --> 00:24:41,554
from Randall and anybody else in town.

368
00:24:41,587 --> 00:24:44,190
He was the sheriff here for 35 years.

369
00:24:44,223 --> 00:24:45,324
[thump]

370
00:24:49,296 --> 00:24:50,163
Hang on there.

371
