brought this if you had.

852
01:32:35,217 --> 01:32:39,588
There's one thing that
I can't quite get by.

853
01:32:40,589 --> 01:32:44,692
The initials. B-D.

854
01:32:44,693 --> 01:32:46,760
Beadie.

855
01:32:47,796 --> 01:32:51,334
Beadie was something else.

856
01:32:53,335 --> 01:32:56,366
When my husband was a boy,

857
01:32:56,367 --> 01:33:00,408
he had a friend who
was killed in an accident.

858
01:33:00,409 --> 01:33:05,179
It was a boy with... fantasies.

859
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:08,482
His name was Brian Delahanty.

860
01:33:08,483 --> 01:33:12,019
I guess he didn't like his first
name very much, because...

861
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:14,228
when my husband was a kid,

862
01:33:14,229 --> 01:33:17,591
- he used to call him...
- BD...

863
01:33:23,932 --> 01:33:26,367
Would you have caught him?

864
01:33:26,768 --> 01:33:28,969
Oh, yeah.

865
01:33:50,659 --> 01:33:52,852
It's blurred,

866
01:33:53,678 --> 01:33:56,731
like it's two pennies.

867
01:33:56,732 --> 01:33:58,866
Yeah.

868
01:33:58,867 --> 01:34:02,102
Some people are that way too.

869
01:34:07,309 --> 01:34:10,579
I'll go now. And uh...

870
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:14,881
You'll do what you have to do.

871
01:34:16,652 --> 01:34:19,218
Missus.

872
01:34:24,593 --> 01:34:28,497
The only thing I have to do...

873
01:34:29,498 --> 01:34:32,832
is pay my taxes.

874
01:34:34,036 --> 01:34:37,371
It's not for me to punish you.

875
01:34:37,372 --> 01:34:40,118
You know your kids are gonna...

876
01:34:40,119 --> 01:34:45,531
talk about how much they
miss dear old... Dad.

877
01:34:45,532 --> 01:34:50,586
And tell their grandkids about
what a fine fella grandpa was.

878
01:34:51,787 --> 01:34:56,789
You're just going to sit there
and listen. Nod, smile...

879
01:34:57,115 --> 01:34:59,168
once in a while,

880
01:34:59,169 --> 01:35:03,457
even have to talk about
the good old days.

881
01:35:05,033 --> 01:35:07,902
Mm.

882
01:35:07,903 --> 01:35:10,804
I can live with that.

883
01:35:12,107 --> 01:35:14,709
Darcy.

884
01:35:14,710 --> 01:35:18,778
Come over here, close to me.

885
01:35:30,859 --> 01:35:34,227
You did the right thing.

886
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:47,908
Now would you mind putting
my music on for me?

887
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:50,743
