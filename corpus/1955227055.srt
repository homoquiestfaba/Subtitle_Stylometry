00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:25,984
Make yourself useful?

545
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,267
Nelly, you gonna join me?

546
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,575
All right, now look.

547
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:52,411
Y'all be careful, cause
these are loaded, all right?

548
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:54,513
Especially you, Wiley!

549
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:57,283
And get rid of the
booze, will ya?

550
00:36:57,383 --> 00:37:00,686
Don't expect a man to
freeze to death, do you?

551
00:37:00,786 --> 00:37:01,553
Give me that!

552
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:03,255
I'm putting it away!

553
00:37:03,355 --> 00:37:04,890
I'm putting it away!

554
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,092
With you all drunk like that,
someone's likely to get hurt!

555
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:08,427
Probably shoot himself.

556
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:11,663
Come on, let's go.

557
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:14,466
Probably shoot himself.

558
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:21,273
[Laughs]

559
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:22,240
See anything you like?

560
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:23,575
Oh, I see two things I like.

561
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:41,360
[Coughs]

562
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,194
Shit.

563
00:37:43,295 --> 00:37:43,995
Wiley, come on!

564
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:52,738
Wiley!

565
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:54,239
I said, come on!

566
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,074
And watch where you're
pointing that damn gun!

567
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:56,875
Come on!

568
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:04,015
Wiley, come on.

569
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,653
Wiley, don't smoke, Wiley, watch
where you're pointing the gun.

570
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:09,388
They treat me like a
damn three year old.

571
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:11,390
JIM: Wiley, shut up!

572
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,458
Wiley, shut up.

573
00:38:12,558 --> 00:38:15,361
Wiley don't do this,
Wiley don't do that.

574
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,781
See, I told you!

575
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:36,882
Just like I said.

576
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,149
He's got one in there right now!

577
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,218
Now settle down, Jim.

578
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,987
Let's not go running
off half cocked.

579
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:43,021
We don't know what he's got!

580
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:44,155
The hell we don't know!

581
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,757
You heard those screams
just as plain as I did.

582
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:47,225
You didn't hear any screams.

583
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,026
Shut up, Wiley!

584
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:49,027
Goddamn it, Sam.

585
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:51,096
Why'd you have to
bring him anyway?

586
00:38:51,196 --> 00:38:52,398
He's all I could
get last minute!

587
00:38:52,498 --> 00:38:53,565
We'd be better off without him!

588
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,567
Now look, we can't
be too careful.

589
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,103
Last time they brought in
Jed, he had a stockpile

590
00:38:58,203 --> 00:38:59,237
Of arms in his place.

591
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,473
That is one crazy son
of a bitch, all right?

592
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:02,674
So we can't take any chances.

593
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:04,810
Now look, you're going
to go around to the left,

594
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,545
You're going to go
around back, Wiley, OK?

595
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:08,179
Now, I'm going to go over...

596
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:09,114
No!

597
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:10,649
Wiley.

598
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:11,617
Now Jim...

599
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:12,718
No!

600
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:14,686
Wiley, what the hell
are you talking about?

601
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:16,922
No, I'm... I said, I'm not going
to do what you say no more,

602
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,189
I'm not going!

603
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:21,693
You... you just can't stand
here and talk about a man

604
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:23,462
Like he wasn't here!

605
00:39:23,562 --> 00:39:25,664
You just can't treat
people like that, Jim!

606
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:26,465
You...

607
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:27,533
Wiley, shut the hell up!

608
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:28,366
Oh!

609
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:30,969
That's what mama always said!

610
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:32,303
Wiley, he didn't mean anything!

612
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:49,421
Look, Wiley, I'm sorry.

613
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:50,221
I'm sorry.

614
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:51,590
OK?

615
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,225
I mean, it... it's just I... I'm
nervous and all, being here.

616
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:57,729
That's all it is.

617
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:59,498
Are we all right, Wiley?

618
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:00,265
All right.

619
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:01,066
We're all right?

620
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,901
OK, we're all right.

621
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:04,870
All right, I'll tell you
what we're going to do.

622
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,204
You're going to go
around the left.

623
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:08,440
Wiley, you're just gonna stay
here and watch the front.

624
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,340
You OK with that?

625
00:40:09,441 --> 00:40:10,141
Mmm.

00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,879

00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,683
What, Wiley?

629
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:20,218
Oh, nothing.

630
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:21,219

Holy Christ, Jim!

What happened?

635
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:18,710
It's Jed Turner!

636
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,879
He attacked me,
but I-I shot him!

Yeah.

659
00:42:43,528 --> 00:42:44,696
There's this road down by
the sewage treatment plant

00:42:44,796 --> 00:42:45,764

they went to a dinner party.

669

Well anyway, this psycho
breaks in dressed like a clown,

00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:08,887
Rapes her, cuts her
up, and hangs her limbs

along the road.

heard about it?

and a leg hanging from a tree.

my cousin lives,

They got these ghost lights.

00:43:45,924 --> 00:43:48,393
Ghost light!

00:43:48,493 --> 00:43:51,429
It's this old confederate
railroad track,

And these lights appear.

693
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:58,804
When you get close to 'em, they
start moving away from you.

have lights on a train

I don't believe it, anyway.

00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,284
So what's the deal
with this creepy place?

701
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,286
My dad told me that
back in the 70s,

702
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,088
This place belonged to
this child rapist guy

703
00:44:17,188 --> 00:44:18,990
Named Jed Turner or something.

704
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:22,493
He snatched like 15 kids,
brought 'em out here,

705
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:25,964
And in that house, he would
rip out their spinal cords...

706
00:44:26,064 --> 00:44:26,998
Man, here, cannonball it, man!

707
00:44:38,143 --> 00:44:41,112
Anyway, this Jed guy
kidnapped a little girl

708
00:44:41,212 --> 00:44:43,949
That belonged to that priest
down... that Baptist church

709
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:45,050
On Center street.

710
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:47,652
You mean that crazy...

arrested for all sorts

00:44:55,093 --> 00:44:56,161
Anyway, that's the one.

715
00:44:56,261 --> 00:44:58,296
So this minister
goes nuts wanting

716
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:01,066
To come after this guy Jed,
but the cops get here first.

717
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:02,267
They catch the child raper?

718
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:03,634
Yeah.

719
00:45:03,735 --> 00:45:05,837
And the only thing they find
of the minister's little girl

720
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:07,405
Is her spinal cord
hanging in the shack.

721
00:45:07,505 --> 00:45:08,740
And this minister goes nuts!

722
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,309
Wanting to come here and burn
this place up, saying it's

723
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:12,243
Haunted and shit.

01:10:27,857 --> 01:10:29,659
What's up with you, Fax?

1088
01:10:29,759 --> 01:10:34,130
I don't know but I wish
they'd come something soon.

1089
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,799
The kid's still here?

1090
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:36,600
Yep.

1091
01:10:39,669 --> 01:10:42,539
You like comics?

1092
01:10:42,639 --> 01:10:43,707
What kinda comics?

1093
01:10:43,807 --> 01:10:44,508
Oh, I don't know.

1094
01:10:44,608 --> 01:10:49,513
Any comic books, really.

1095
01:10:49,613 --> 01:10:51,848
Sometimes.

1096
01:10:51,948 --> 01:10:52,649
I love comics.

1097
01:10:57,487 --> 01:10:59,889
Maybe you don't
understand how this works.

1098
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:02,258
You see, we ask you a question.

1099
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:04,494
You give us an answer, huh?

1100
01:11:07,464 --> 01:11:08,798
Come on.

1101
01:11:08,898 --> 01:11:13,770
What happened at the
truck stop restaurant?

1102
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:18,107
Human unhappiness
is [inaudible]

1103
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:21,645
If people have the ability
to control their soul, then

1104
01:11:21,745 --> 01:11:24,314
[Inaudible].

1105
01:11:24,414 --> 01:11:26,450
OK, smart guy!

1106
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:28,985
I've had about enough
of your bullshit.

1107
01:11:29,085 --> 01:11:31,355
Do you like it?

1108
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:34,223
That's it, pal!

1109
01:11:34,324 --> 01:11:35,158
Oh no, Randy.

1110
01:11:35,258 --> 01:11:38,362
I know what you're thinking!

1111
01:11:38,462 --> 01:11:39,596
Oh no, Randy!

1112
01:11:39,696 --> 01:11:40,397
You are...

1113
01:11:40,497 --> 01:11:43,367
[Yells]

1114
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:43,760
Who the fuck are you?

1115
01:13:39,983 --> 01:13:40,684
What do you want?

1116
01:13:40,784 --> 01:13:41,485
What do you want?

1117
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:47,957
[Gunshot]

1118
01:13:54,531 --> 01:13:57,400
[Wind whistling]

1119
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:31,067
She's a real winner.

1120
01:14:37,273 --> 01:14:42,478
If you have not seen this
life, you ain't seen shit.

1121
01:14:42,579 --> 01:14:43,279
Not yet.

1122
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:51,187
I've seen it all.

1123
01:14:51,287 --> 01:14:55,024
I was fucking cold as
the rest of the world.

1124
01:14:59,896 --> 01:15:02,265
Can't feel no more!

1125
01:15:02,365 --> 01:15:04,634
Guess it don't matter.

1126
01:15:04,734 --> 01:15:05,569
Can't feel my dick!

1127
01:15:16,412 --> 01:15:20,383
One cold fucker messes
someone up, you pass it on.

1128
01:15:24,888 --> 01:15:26,289
I don't care anymore!

1129
01:15:29,325 --> 01:15:30,393
Fuck!

1130
01:15:30,493 --> 01:15:31,194
They won.

1131
01:15:43,139 --> 01:15:45,041
I don't know what
fuels anything.

1132
01:15:51,615 --> 01:15:53,016
Got it figured out!

1133
01:15:56,119 --> 01:15:57,020
They're all dead!

1134
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:02,491
Or should be.

1135
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:12,501
I... I'm just a pawn on some
bitter artist's canvas!
