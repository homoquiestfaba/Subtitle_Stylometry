Jesus, Alex.

14
00:02:40,798 --> 00:02:41,798
Hello?

15
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:47,036
Yes, this is him,
but I'm at work.

16
00:02:57,947 --> 00:03:00,450
Used to have a freshman
roommate named Ben, but

17
00:03:00,451 --> 00:03:03,790
that asswad hasn't
called me in ages.

18
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,725
What?

19
00:03:09,726 --> 00:03:10,792
And no one was there?

20
00:03:10,793 --> 00:03:11,861
He was...

21
00:03:11,862 --> 00:03:14,196
Alone?

22
00:03:14,197 --> 00:03:15,565
Yeah, of course he was alone.

23
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:17,533
That was stupid.

24
00:03:17,534 --> 00:03:20,503
Yeah, I can probably
get up in a couple hours. I just

25
00:03:20,504 --> 00:03:24,046
need a little bit of time
to get out of here.

26
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,046
Well, he's gonna be okay.

27
00:03:30,047 --> 00:03:32,449
That's the most important thing.

28
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:34,550
Okay.

29
00:03:34,551 --> 00:03:34,818
I gotta take this.

30
00:03:35,018 --> 00:03:36,586
Hang on a sec.

31
00:03:36,587 --> 00:03:38,588
Babe?

32
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:39,689
Yeah, I'm fine.

33
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,690

him?

38
00:04:06,048 --> 00:04:07,783
Said it might be tonight.

39
00:04:07,784 --> 00:04:08,917
Might be in the morning.

40
00:04:08,918 --> 00:04:09,652
Do we call them?

41
00:04:09,653 --> 00:04:11,587
Because I feel like if we...

42
00:04:11,588 --> 00:04:12,955
I called them already.

43
00:04:12,956 --> 00:04:14,923
There's nothing else we can do.

44
00:04:14,924 --> 00:04:16,092
Yeah.

45
00:04:16,093 --> 00:04:18,233
Just keep straight.

46
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:23,800
Babe?

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,836
Mm?

48
00:04:26,837 --> 00:04:28,741
I got the fellowship.

49
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:32,944
Wow.

50
00:04:33,944 --> 00:04:34,776
Wow.

51
00:04:34,777 --> 00:04:36,545
Yeah, I know.

52
00:04:36,546 --> 00:04:38,280
When were you going to tell me?

53
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:38,961
What do you mean?

54
00:04:39,116 --> 00:04:40,249
I'm telling you now.

55
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,285
Yeah, h-how long
have you known?

56
00:04:42,286 --> 00:04:44,287
I found out yesterday.

57
00:04:44,288 --> 00:04:46,989
Yeah, I mean, it's, it's
great for you, right?

58
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,658
It's a great opportunity.

59
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:49,659
- Yeah
- Yeah.

60
00:04:50,226 --> 00:04:51,761
It is, but...

61
00:04:51,762 --> 00:04:55,263
And then about us
moving out there.

62
00:04:55,264 --> 00:04:58,000
I think we've had this
conversation like fifty times.

63
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,671
I can't just quit my
job and move to LA.

64
00:05:54,991 --> 00:05:58,360
Sarah's train should
be getting in.

65
00:05:58,361 --> 00:06:00,028
Okay.

66
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:01,901
I'm gonna stay here.

67
00:06:04,901 --> 00:06:06,735
Josh!

68
00:06:06,736 --> 00:06:07,369
Hey.

69
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,073
Hey, Sarah, uh, hi.

70
00:06:11,074 --> 00:06:14,843
Hi.

71
00:06:14,844 --> 00:06:15,684
It's good to see you.

72
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:18,247
Oh, yeah, it's good
to see you too.

73
00:06:18,248 --> 00:06:20,650
Have you talked to Alex?

74
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:23,352
No, but I can't wait to
ask that fucker what the

75
00:06:23,353 --> 00:06:25,720
hell he was thinking.

76
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:28,090
Um, you're not actually
going to say that to him,

77
00:06:28,091 --> 00:06:29,124
- are you?
- Why not?

78
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,005
Because he's fragile and
that's not appropriate.

79
00:06:31,006 --> 00:06:31,728
How do you know?

80
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:33,865
When was the last time
you talked to him?

81
00:06:34,865 --> 00:06:36,131
That's what I thought.

82
00:06:36,132 --> 00:06:37,332
What do you want to do, Sarah?

83
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,100
You wanna just tiptoe
around the whole thing?

84
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:41,369
Pretend like nothing happened?

85
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,006
No, no, I think we should...

86
00:06:44,007 --> 00:06:45,975
I think we should make
him feel safe and...

87
00:06:45,976 --> 00:06:47,009
Oh, okay.

88
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,076
Loved, and...

89
00:06:48,077 --> 00:06:49,278
Yeah, and I think he's
going to think that that's

90
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,014
bullshit, and I think he's
going to see right through it.

91
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:52,747
<i>Sarah!</i>

92
00:06:52,748 --> 00:06:53,449
What?

93
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,283
<i>Josh!</i>

94
00:06:54,284 --> 00:06:54,817
Hey.

95
00:06:55,017 --> 00:06:56,255
Hi!

96
00:06:58,255 --> 00:06:59,355
And you!

97
00:06:59,356 --> 00:07:01,790
We didn't even know
whether to expect you or not.

98
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,091
No, well...

99
00:07:03,092 --> 00:07:04,326
Where's Isaac?

100
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:06,028
Is he up here yet with
the new lady friend?

101
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:07,129
Is that happening?

102
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,097
With the who?

103
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:09,198
Isaac's bringing someone?

104
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:09,999
Yeah.

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,800
His girlfriend.

106
00:07:10,801 --> 00:07:12,167
I didn't know he
was seeing anyone.

107
00:07:12,168 --> 00:07:12,934
It's recent.

108
00:07:12,935 --> 00:07:13,968
It's recent.

109
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:14,903
She's 22.

110
00:07:14,904 --> 00:07:15,838
No she's not.

111
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:16,771
Mhmm.

112
00:07:16,772 --> 00:07:18,107
Is she?

113
00:07:18,108 --> 00:07:18,674
What's wrong?

114
00:07:18,675 --> 00:07:19,595
It's not like she's 11.

115
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:20,542
Calm down.

116
00:07:20,543 --> 00:07:22,583
Okay, first of all, you're
disgusting, and second of

117
00:07:22,584 --> 00:07:25,448
all, um, why does Isaac
think it's appropriate to

118
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:26,449
bring a date to...

119
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,484
How is it inappropriate?

120
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:28,718
I was this close to
bringing, I was this close

121
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:30,959
to bringing a date, and she
canceled at the last minute.

122
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
She had a thing.

123
00:07:36,358 --> 00:07:36,959
Hi.

124
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:39,261
It's okay that
I'm coming, right.

125
00:07:39,262 --> 00:07:40,261
Yeah, of course it's okay.

126
00:07:40,262 --> 00:07:41,329
You said you wanted to
come, I said it's fine.

127
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,130
Of course it's fine.

128
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:43,331
Wait, what?

129
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:44,652
No, I didn't say
I wanted to come.

130
00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:46,493
I said that I wanted to
be there for you if you

131
00:07:46,494 --> 00:07:47,737
wanted me to be there.

132
00:07:47,738 --> 00:07:49,658
Why would I tell you to
come if I didn't want you

133
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:50,159
to come.

134
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:52,006
I am so sorry, but we're
out of premium-class

135
00:07:52,007 --> 00:07:53,242
vehicles.

136
00:07:53,243 --> 00:07:54,443
Could we interest you in one
of our more affordable models?

137
00:07:54,444 --> 00:07:55,404
Yeah, yeah. That's fine.

138
00:07:55,405 --> 00:07:56,879
Anything with
wheels is fine. Thanks.

139
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,314
I shouldn't be here.

140
00:07:59,315 --> 00:08:01,252
Babe...

141
00:08:02,252 --> 00:08:04,887
I.. I wouldn't have
said you should come...

142
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,026
<i>I'm just saying it's
an objective truth.</i>

143
00:08:44,027 --> 00:08:46,896
Japanese are the most
wacked-out people on earth.

144
00:08:46,897 --> 00:08:48,830
Oh my God, you're like
an 8 year-old racist.

145
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:49,899
An 8 year-old racist...

146
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,860
Look, you cram that many
people on an island, it's

147
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:54,502
like a throbbing inbred
hothouse of cultural miasma.

148
00:08:54,503 --> 00:09:00,342
Frankly, I'm surprised
they don't have more fetishes.

149
00:09:00,343 --> 00:09:01,877
Oh shit.

150
00:09:01,878 --> 00:09:03,279
Ben Ben!

151
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,512
You came.

152
00:09:04,513 --> 00:09:09,117
Against my better
fucking judgment, I came.

153
00:09:09,118 --> 00:09:10,118
Get the fuck over here.

154
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:11,522
How you doing?

155
00:09:13,522 --> 00:09:15,491
Ben, get my back here please.

156
00:09:15,492 --> 00:09:17,292
We're not just going to
pretend with Alex like

157
00:09:17,293 --> 00:09:18,861
nothing happened here, right?

158
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:20,094
What are you going to say?

159
00:09:20,095 --> 00:09:20,996
"Hey Alex.

160
00:09:20,997 --> 00:09:22,832
Interesting choice
to commit suicide."

161
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,567
Thank you, Ben.

162
00:09:24,568 --> 00:09:25,601
Excuse me.

163
00:09:25,602 --> 00:09:27,035
- Hi!
- Oh my God...

164
00:09:27,036 --> 00:09:28,876
I can't believe that you
have her side on this.

165
00:09:28,877 --> 00:09:30,171
Hey, hey, hey.

166
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:31,372
There are no sides.

167
00:09:31,373 --> 00:09:34,008
Let's just let
this be about Alex.

168
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:35,109
Right?

169
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,012
And speaking of which, I
think we should watch him.

170
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:40,082
What?

171
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,284
What, do you want to
set up like a monitoring system?

172
00:09:42,285 --> 00:09:45,487
Yeah. Kind of, but it'd be
casual.

173
00:09:45,488 --> 00:09:48,189
You know, tag in, tag out,
have somebody with him at

174
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,290
all times.

175
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,526
How about you go first.

176
00:09:50,527 --> 00:09:51,593
You want to start?

177
00:09:51,594 --> 00:09:52,361
This is ridiculous.

178
00:09:52,362 --> 00:09:53,329
No it's not, Josh.

179
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:53,998
This, this is ridiculous.

180
00:09:54,198 --> 00:09:55,798
- Is this not ridiculous?
- I Googled it.

181
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,298
You what?

182
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:56,966
I Googled it.

183
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,367
Case in point.

184
00:09:58,368 --> 00:10:02,338
I'm gonna get some air.

185
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:06,276
Is there not air in here?

186
00:10:27,229 --> 00:10:28,363
You came.

187
00:10:28,364 --> 00:10:30,272
Of course I came.

188
00:10:36,272 --> 00:10:37,439
How you feeling?

189
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,373
I'm good.

190
00:10:38,374 --> 00:10:41,309
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

191
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,482
I mean I, you know, considering.

192
00:10:45,482 --> 00:10:47,382
Um, Alex look, about the call...

193
00:10:47,383 --> 00:10:48,684
Don't, no no.

194
00:10:48,685 --> 00:10:51,949
Don't tell me that we're having
a party in honor of my suicide.

195
00:10:52,222 --> 00:10:55,591
Attempted suicide.

196
00:10:55,592 --> 00:10:59,699
Geez, if it were a suicide
we'd both be wearing suits.

197
00:11:02,638 --> 00:11:04,165
Can't treat it lightly, okay?

198
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:07,169
Maybe we should get
him a muffin basket.

199
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,338
I'm serious, the
first 48 hours...

200
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:09,840
Alex!

201
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,109
- Hi!
- Hey.

202
00:11:14,109 --> 00:11:16,411
Jesus, Alex.

203
00:11:16,412 --> 00:11:18,332
If you wanted to see all
of us, you could've just

204
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,834
shot us an email.

205
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:25,087
Wow.

206
00:11:25,088 --> 00:11:26,454
We were going to pick you up.

207
00:11:26,455 --> 00:11:27,615
Oh, no, don't worry about it.

208
00:11:27,616 --> 00:11:28,524
This was...

209
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:30,726
Easy.

210
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:32,694
Well.

211
00:11:32,695 --> 00:11:33,562
Do you need anything?

212
00:11:33,563 --> 00:11:35,064
Do you want to sit down?

213
00:11:35,065 --> 00:11:36,030
Um, I'm good.

214
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:36,871
- You're hungry?
- No.

215
00:11:36,872 --> 00:11:38,352
Do you want me to
make you a sandwich?

216
00:11:38,353 --> 00:11:41,069
Um...

217
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,339
No, I uh, actually I
think I'm going to go get

218
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,275
changed.

219
00:11:45,276 --> 00:11:48,680
I feel a little gross,
you know what I mean?

220
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,649
Um, I'll keep you company.

221
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,086
Excuse me.

222
00:11:59,488 --> 00:12:02,458
Way to act normal, by the way.

223
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:04,126
Way to be an asshole.

224
00:12:04,127 --> 00:12:06,562
Real nice, just...

225
00:12:06,563 --> 00:12:08,363
Sandwich, what, you want
to offer him anything

226
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:09,698
else?

227
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:11,599
So why'd you leave LA?

228
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,270
Um, I don't know.

229
00:12:15,271 --> 00:12:20,242
I, I just, you know the
acting thing was only

230
00:12:20,243 --> 00:12:24,215
going okay, and the city's
a fucking soul killer.

231
00:12:25,815 --> 00:12:28,183
Yeah, I was running out
of cash, my mom was in

232
00:12:28,184 --> 00:12:32,556
fucking Bali, my dad left me
this, and you were, you know...

233
00:12:34,556 --> 00:12:36,494
We kind of lost touch.

234
00:12:38,253 --> 00:12:41,096
What I was going to say
outside, when you first came...

235
00:12:41,097 --> 00:12:44,699
Hey, the world's
got enough people.

236
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,437
You have to
explain yourself, too.

237
00:12:48,405 --> 00:12:50,772
Josh is still an asshole.

238
00:12:50,773 --> 00:12:52,733
If he's going to be like
this all weekend, I swear

239
00:12:52,734 --> 00:12:53,409
to God...

240
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,676
He's just dealing
with it, you know.

241
00:12:55,677 --> 00:12:56,712
In his own way.

242
00:12:56,713 --> 00:12:58,713
And shouldn't Isaac know
there's no such thing as a

243
00:12:58,714 --> 00:13:03,151
+1 to a friend's attempted
suicide weekend thing?

244
00:13:03,152 --> 00:13:04,392
It's not a fucking Bar Mitzvah.

245
00:13:04,393 --> 00:13:06,155
You know you sound like Josh.

246
00:13:06,156 --> 00:13:07,289
Oh my God, you're right.

247
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,824
Ugh...

248
00:13:09,825 --> 00:13:10,793
How are you?

249
00:13:10,794 --> 00:13:13,094
How are you and Ben?

250
00:13:13,095 --> 00:13:14,663
We're fine.

251
00:13:14,664 --> 00:13:18,567
Okay, so, not so good fine.

252
00:13:18,568 --> 00:13:22,103
What's going on?

253
00:13:22,104 --> 00:13:23,104
Hey?

254
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:28,510
I'm late.

255
00:13:28,511 --> 00:13:30,612
How late?

256
00:13:30,613 --> 00:13:32,782
Late late.

257
00:13:33,782 --> 00:13:36,084
Does Ben know?

258
00:13:36,085 --> 00:13:37,390
Nope.

259
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,256
Hey.

260
00:13:41,257 --> 00:13:41,557
Hi.

261
00:13:41,757 --> 00:13:42,591
How you doing?

262
00:13:42,592 --> 00:13:43,357
Good.

263
00:13:43,358 --> 00:13:44,078
You need anything?

264
00:13:44,194 --> 00:13:45,260
No, I'm still fine.

265
00:13:45,261 --> 00:13:46,462
What?

266
00:13:46,463 --> 00:13:47,030
Here.

267
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,131
Hey, where's the
bathroom in here?

268
00:13:50,132 --> 00:13:51,333
Use the one upstairs.

269
00:13:51,334 --> 00:13:52,368
Trust me.

270
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:57,872
Isaac is calling.

271
00:13:57,873 --> 00:14:01,676
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

272
00:14:01,677 --> 00:14:02,644
<i>Really?</i>

273
00:14:02,645 --> 00:14:04,612
Can your +1 not use a GPS?

274
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:07,140
I thought young people
were good at those things.

275
00:14:07,517 --> 00:14:09,286
Be nice, Sarah.

276
00:14:10,286 --> 00:14:12,223
Isaac is close, but lost.

277
00:14:13,054 --> 00:14:13,791
You know what?

278
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:15,491
I'll just drive
out and meet him.

279
00:14:15,492 --> 00:14:16,732
I'm gonna go get some firewood.

280
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:17,813
I'm gonna go pee in nature.

281
00:14:17,814 --> 00:14:19,346
I'll stay and watch Alex.

282
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:24,366
I mean I'll...

283
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:27,502
Put on some pasta for dinner.

284
00:14:27,503 --> 00:14:28,370
That sound good?

285
00:14:28,371 --> 00:14:31,173
That sounds great.

286
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:32,306
You want to come with me?

287
00:14:32,307 --> 00:14:33,342
Yeah, I'll come with you.

288
00:14:33,343 --> 00:14:34,483
Great.

289
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:43,919
You clearly have no idea
what you're doing, do you?

290
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,927
Fuck you.

291
00:14:51,927 --> 00:14:53,395
Here, give me it.

292
00:14:53,396 --> 00:14:54,642
I know.

293
00:15:06,642 --> 00:15:08,544
Let me try again.

294
00:15:08,545 --> 00:15:10,312
No.

295
00:15:10,313 --> 00:15:10,813
No?

296
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,680
No.

297
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:15,684
I thought you all of calc
21, and then you went off

298
00:15:15,685 --> 00:15:18,353
and you did better
than me on the exam.

299
00:15:18,354 --> 00:15:20,622
I'm not teaching you
how to chop wood.

300
00:15:20,623 --> 00:15:22,623
It's not my fault you
have performance anxiety.

301
00:15:22,624 --> 00:15:24,430
I perform just fine.

302
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,431
You don't have to
cook, you know.

303
00:15:30,432 --> 00:15:31,232
It's okay.

304
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:33,901
It's the only thing
that relaxes me.

305
00:15:33,902 --> 00:15:36,671
Really?

306
00:15:36,672 --> 00:15:38,240
It's just...

307
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:41,877
Been a while since
I've seen everyone.

308
00:15:41,878 --> 00:15:43,718
You know, if you need to
get something off your

309
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:44,646
chest, you should...

310
00:15:44,647 --> 00:15:49,318
I don't need you of all
people to give me advice on...

311
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:50,785
I'm sorry.

312
00:15:50,786 --> 00:15:52,688
No, it's...

313
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:53,689
I didn't mean that.

314
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,530
It's a fair point.

315
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:05,500
What?

316
00:16:05,501 --> 00:16:06,401
They...

317
00:16:06,402 --> 00:16:08,402
Are here.

318
00:16:08,403 --> 00:16:09,972
Oh.

319
00:16:09,973 --> 00:16:13,976
She's hot.

320
00:16:13,977 --> 00:16:15,276
Your...

321
00:16:15,277 --> 00:16:16,377
Your boobs are bigger.

322
00:16:16,378 --> 00:16:17,550
That's not true.

323
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,750
That's not true.

324
00:16:21,751 --> 00:16:24,422
Ugh.

325
00:16:27,422 --> 00:16:28,522
No they're not.

326
00:16:28,523 --> 00:16:29,992
Hey!

327
00:16:29,993 --> 00:16:31,693
Look who I found.

328
00:16:31,694 --> 00:16:32,861
Hey handsome.

329
00:16:32,862 --> 00:16:34,563
Oh, you didn't have to fly all
the way across the country.

330
00:16:34,564 --> 00:16:35,844
Are you kidding me? I wanted to.

331
00:16:35,845 --> 00:16:36,530
Alex, Kate.

332
00:16:36,531 --> 00:16:38,333
Kate, Alex.

333
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:40,702
Hey, I-I've heard
a lot about you.

334
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,969
I've heard a lot about you.

335
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,539
What the fuck are those?

336
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,675
That's how you say "hi" now?

337
00:16:46,676 --> 00:16:48,543
They're shiny and pointy.

338
00:16:48,544 --> 00:16:49,744
They're Italian, motherfucker.

339
00:16:49,745 --> 00:16:51,182
You look like a lumberjack.

340
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:55,129
Oh, dude, if you'd told us
you were coming out of the

341
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,268
closet we could've
thrown you a party.

342
00:16:57,487 --> 00:16:59,554
I told you my
friends are awesome.

343
00:16:59,555 --> 00:17:01,790
Um, is there a
bathroom I could-

344
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,724
upstairs!

345
00:17:03,725 --> 00:17:07,496
Dinner is almost ready.

346
00:17:07,497 --> 00:17:08,663
Hey.

347
00:17:08,664 --> 00:17:09,664
Yeah.

348
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:22,311
Sarah, this pasta is delicious.

349
00:17:22,312 --> 00:17:25,514
Mm, it is pasta and
sauce from a can.

350
00:17:25,515 --> 00:17:28,016
Tomorrow, I'll make
something real.

351
00:17:28,017 --> 00:17:30,651
Instagram tells me you're
still cooking a lot.

352
00:17:30,652 --> 00:17:32,586
Instagram lies.

353
00:17:32,587 --> 00:17:34,689
Unless Ramen counts.

354
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,425
So that's what being
a lawyer's like.

355
00:17:36,426 --> 00:17:37,493
Fulfilling all your
hopes and dreams?

356
00:17:37,494 --> 00:17:39,561
Not all of us can stand to
destroy the planet on the

357
00:17:39,562 --> 00:17:41,028
backs of hedge funds.

358
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:42,930
<i>That's not what I meant.</i>

359
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:45,766
I'm just saying, look, we
graduated, aside, aside

360
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:49,504
from you, at the onset of
the worst recession in 80 years.

361
00:17:49,505 --> 00:17:51,972
History says that most of
us will never regain the

362
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:54,709
income levels that we
might have otherwise enjoyed.

363
00:17:54,710 --> 00:18:00,681
Isaac here is a beautiful anomaly,
and for that, we salute him.

364
00:18:00,682 --> 00:18:01,749
Thanks pal.

365
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,018
Appreciate it.

366
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:06,822
How's the uh, how's your
PhD going?

367
00:18:06,823 --> 00:18:07,788
<i>Mm.</i>

368
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:09,056
What's that supposed to mean?

369
00:18:09,057 --> 00:18:10,425
It's just a simple question.

370
00:18:10,426 --> 00:18:11,493
Nah, it's had subtext.

371
00:18:11,494 --> 00:18:12,593
Oh, you want the subtext?

372
00:18:12,594 --> 00:18:13,754
Of course I want the subtext.

373
00:18:13,755 --> 00:18:15,195
Don't you know who
you're talking to?

374
00:18:15,196 --> 00:18:16,531
Did you forget who I am?

375
00:18:16,532 --> 00:18:18,532
<i>Okay, so how's life up on
your academic high horse,</i>

376
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:21,635
uh, looking down on the
rest of us and despairing

377
00:18:21,636 --> 00:18:23,940
about the decline
of our culture?

378
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,877
It's comments like those,
Isaac, that make me despair.

379
00:18:28,878 --> 00:18:30,918
Actually, Josh, sorry, but
I'd like to know what the

380
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:32,781
hell you're doing there too.

381
00:18:32,782 --> 00:18:35,414
<i>Yeah, all joking aside,
what are you writing about?</i>

382
00:18:36,796 --> 00:18:38,954
I'm writing about the
future of biography.

383
00:18:38,955 --> 00:18:43,891
How our ever-expanding
digital footprint, emails,

384
00:18:43,892 --> 00:18:48,497
texts, tweets, will inform
our understanding of

385
00:18:48,498 --> 00:18:50,064
history and ourselves.

386
00:18:50,065 --> 00:18:51,833
Which is ironic.

387
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:53,034
Why?

388
00:18:53,035 --> 00:18:56,103
Because I hate the modern world.

389
00:18:56,104 --> 00:18:58,172
Which era would you
rather have lived in?

390
00:18:58,173 --> 00:19:00,074
I'm sorry, what was
your name again?

391
00:19:00,075 --> 00:19:00,842
<i>It was Kate?</i>

392
00:19:00,843 --> 00:19:01,843
- Kate? Kate.
- Josh...

393
00:19:01,844 --> 00:19:03,564
I'm just saying,
I'm sorry. It's Kate? Kate?

394
00:19:03,565 --> 00:19:03,879
Yeah.

395
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,720
<i>The only thing I hate
more than the present is</i>

396
00:19:05,721 --> 00:19:07,094
nostalgia for the past.

397
00:19:12,121 --> 00:19:13,361
Hey, you don't have to do that.

398
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:14,656
No, no let me do something.

399
00:19:14,657 --> 00:19:15,524
Nope!

400
00:19:15,525 --> 00:19:16,725
You want to take shifts?

401
00:19:16,726 --> 00:19:19,795
He's compensating for the
fact that he can't chop wood.

402
00:19:19,796 --> 00:19:21,356
Oh my God, when'd you
get so mean, Josh?

403
00:19:21,357 --> 00:19:22,898
You're so mean.

404
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:25,967
Probably the same time you
traded in for those shoes.

405
00:19:25,968 --> 00:19:28,368
This whole footwear smear campaign
is really cutting me deep.

406
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:29,097
It's a real shame.

407
00:19:29,098 --> 00:19:30,874
Maybe you should commit suicide.

408
00:19:32,874 --> 00:19:34,708
What?

409
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:36,076
Is it too s-
Alex is laughing.

410
00:19:36,077 --> 00:19:38,447
Look at that.

411
00:19:38,448 --> 00:19:39,950
That's a good joke.

412
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,529
So how did you and Isaac meet?

413
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:44,952
Mm...

414
00:19:44,953 --> 00:19:46,455
It's embarrassing.

415
00:19:46,456 --> 00:19:47,523
Why?

416
00:19:47,524 --> 00:19:51,125
Well, I was an, I was an
intern at his office, but

417
00:19:51,126 --> 00:19:53,762
we didn't start dating
until after I left, of course.

418
00:19:53,763 --> 00:19:55,630
Of course.

419
00:19:55,631 --> 00:19:57,603
I think it's sweet.

420
00:20:00,603 --> 00:20:02,070
Hey, I found two.

421
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:03,839
Great.

422
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,076
Thanks.

423
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:10,010
So are you going
to go with that?

424
00:20:10,011 --> 00:20:11,011
Uh...

425
00:20:11,514 --> 00:20:13,834
There's a whole chapter
devoted to hair implants.

426
00:20:13,835 --> 00:20:15,075
You have to do it in his voice.

427
00:20:15,076 --> 00:20:18,786
Or, no. Exhibit B: The mature
man's guide to style.

428
00:20:18,787 --> 00:20:20,020
Oh my God, do not move.

429
00:20:20,021 --> 00:20:21,656
Hold that up right now.

430
00:20:21,657 --> 00:20:24,659
Please, just pose
with the cover please.

431
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,794
Oh yeah.

432
00:20:25,795 --> 00:20:27,755
<i>Would you like to hear
the section on hair plugs?</i>

433
00:20:27,756 --> 00:20:30,899
How's your novel, Ben?

434
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,633
It's good.

435
00:20:32,634 --> 00:20:34,535
It'll be done soon.

436
00:20:34,536 --> 00:20:38,773
Is it better or worse
than your New York story?

437
00:20:38,774 --> 00:20:42,009
It is, without a doubt, longer.

438
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,111
<i>God, I loved that story.</i>

439
00:20:43,112 --> 00:20:44,778
It was so good.

440
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:46,747
It's the only reason
Siri went out with me.

441
00:20:46,748 --> 00:20:47,681
That's not true.

442
00:20:47,682 --> 00:20:48,449
That's true.

443
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,950
<i>- That's not true.
- It's true.</i>

444
00:20:49,951 --> 00:20:51,521
Maybe a little bit.

445
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:56,858
I think I still
have a copy here.

446
00:20:56,859 --> 00:20:58,526
You know what we should do?

447
00:20:58,527 --> 00:21:00,795
We should stage a
dramatic reading.

448
00:21:00,796 --> 00:21:02,197
That is not going to happen.

449
00:21:02,198 --> 00:21:03,698
Can you imagine?

450
00:21:03,699 --> 00:21:05,166
Everybody would participate.

451
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:07,002
I'll be the roommate,
you could play...

452
00:21:07,202 --> 00:21:09,610
Josh, really it's fine.

453
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,310
Sarah.

454
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:15,912
What?

455
00:21:16,112 --> 00:21:17,797
Enough with the
fucking pictures.

456
00:21:18,213 --> 00:21:20,916
I'm sorry, I'm recording
this for posterity.

457
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:21,749
Is that okay?

458
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,484
By what?

459
00:21:22,485 --> 00:21:23,645
By ruining it in the present?

460
00:21:23,646 --> 00:21:25,019
No, that's your job.

461
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,086
Okay, come on.

462
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:27,288
Hold on, hold on.

463
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:27,891
That's okay.

464
00:21:28,091 --> 00:21:29,371
Sarah, let me ask you something.

465
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:30,926
What?

466
00:21:30,927 --> 00:21:33,127
What, what are you going
to do with these pictures, huh?

467
00:21:33,228 --> 00:21:35,964
Are you going to post
them on Facebook?

468
00:21:35,965 --> 00:21:36,898
I don't know, maybe.

469
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:37,966
Would that make you mad?

470
00:21:37,967 --> 00:21:39,047
<i>You're clinically obsessed.</i>

471
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,008
I like to see what
my friends are up to. Big deal.

472
00:21:41,202 --> 00:21:43,705
So what, your news feed
tells you that Isaac got a

473
00:21:43,706 --> 00:21:47,641
new pair of Italian
loafers or Ben, Ben wrote

474
00:21:47,642 --> 00:21:49,577
a, a funny headline for
the post, and that makes

475
00:21:49,578 --> 00:21:51,079
you feel like you
still know somebody?

476
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,649
Yeah, kind of, because
that's what people do now, Josh.

477
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,984
People who care, at least.

478
00:21:55,985 --> 00:21:57,745
Well, you know what,
I'm sorry, but maybe I'd

479
00:21:57,746 --> 00:21:59,746
rather be in the fucking
dark as to what people are

480
00:21:59,747 --> 00:22:02,189
up to than mistake some
false level of intimacy

481
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,624
for friendship.

482
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:04,726
That is such bullshit.

483
00:22:04,727 --> 00:22:05,794
We're still friends.

484
00:22:05,795 --> 00:22:09,029
Isaac is on his BlackBerry
sending emails to San

485
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,364
Francisco right now.

486
00:22:10,365 --> 00:22:12,100
Enough. Isaac...

487
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:13,134
Yeah?

488
00:22:13,135 --> 00:22:16,705
Remember when I got
stoned for the first time?

489
00:22:16,706 --> 00:22:18,707
When we went to the
natural history museum?

490
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:19,975
I remember you freaking out.

491
00:22:19,976 --> 00:22:21,110
<i>Yeah.</i>

492
00:22:21,111 --> 00:22:25,279
And you had to make me
dance and make me feel better?

493
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,983
And you did the devil dance?

494
00:22:27,984 --> 00:22:28,717
Oh my God.

495
00:22:28,718 --> 00:22:29,718
<i>Devil dance.
Devil dance?</i>

496
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:32,754
<i>- I totally
- it's my favorite thing.</i>

497
00:22:32,755 --> 00:22:34,355
I thought you hated dancing.

498
00:22:34,356 --> 00:22:37,891
Isaac doesn't d-, Isaac dances.

499
00:22:37,892 --> 00:22:40,295
Okay, so what was
Isaac like in college?

500
00:22:40,296 --> 00:22:40,962
Dorky.

501
00:22:41,162 --> 00:22:42,130
Uncultured.

502
00:22:42,131 --> 00:22:44,164
Pretty much exactly
what he is right now.

503
00:22:44,165 --> 00:22:45,165
I was pretty dorky.

504
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,235
Okay, so you were
really adorable.

505
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:49,208
Yeah, thanks.

506
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:54,676
So what do you do, Kate?

507
00:22:54,677 --> 00:22:56,811
I work at a suicide and
crisis hotline for teens

508
00:22:56,812 --> 00:22:57,950
in the bay area.

509
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,470
That sounded strange. I'm
sorry, I didn't realize

510
00:23:03,471 --> 00:23:04,919
until it came out of my mouth.

511
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,200
Shame I didn't have your number.

512
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:08,569
You could've solved
all my problems.

513
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:20,834
Why did you lie?

514
00:23:20,835 --> 00:23:22,937
When?

515
00:23:22,938 --> 00:23:26,373
Alex, about the book.

516
00:23:26,374 --> 00:23:28,677
I didn't lie.

517
00:23:28,678 --> 00:23:31,248
I said the book will be
done soon and it will.

518
00:23:32,248 --> 00:23:34,682
Why not just say it's
still in research.

519
00:23:34,683 --> 00:23:35,750
Just, you know?

520
00:23:35,751 --> 00:23:39,120
Because maybe this weekend
isn't about my problems.

521
00:23:39,121 --> 00:23:41,355
If you want to schedule
some time to do that, we can

522
00:23:41,356 --> 00:23:43,093
find it.

523
00:23:44,093 --> 00:23:46,127
She seems really sweet.

524
00:23:46,128 --> 00:23:47,762
Stop it.

525
00:23:47,763 --> 00:23:50,998
Tell us all about your
illicit office romance.

526
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:52,066
Hmm?

527
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:53,267
You're being so annoying.

528
00:23:53,268 --> 00:23:55,070
Did you play naughty intern?

529
00:23:55,071 --> 00:23:56,071
That's not what happened.

530
00:23:56,205 --> 00:23:58,172
What, I think it's hot.

531
00:23:58,173 --> 00:23:59,708
Go to sleep.

532
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:00,669
All of you, go to sleep.

533
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,942
Get out of here.

534
00:24:01,943 --> 00:24:03,410
I'm ready to go to sleep.

535
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:04,411
<i>I'm over it.</i>

536
00:24:04,412 --> 00:24:07,117
I'll go with you.

537
00:24:09,117 --> 00:24:09,918
Good night.

538
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:10,718
Good night.

539
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:11,452
Night guys.

540
00:24:11,453 --> 00:24:14,022
Night.

541
00:24:14,023 --> 00:24:15,890
Just gonna hang out?

542
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:18,293
How many times does she
wake up during the night?

543
00:24:18,294 --> 00:24:20,214
Like do you have to feed
her, like, I don't know,

544
00:24:20,228 --> 00:24:22,029
hour and a half?

545
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,031
You're such an asshole.

546
00:24:23,032 --> 00:24:24,792
Cause my friend, I have
some friends who have

547
00:24:24,793 --> 00:24:27,102
kids, and they say
it's like Vietnam.

548
00:24:27,103 --> 00:24:28,739
<i>Go fuck yourself.</i>

549
00:24:30,739 --> 00:24:34,141
He had been calling me a lot.

550
00:24:34,142 --> 00:24:36,076
Mm?

551
00:24:36,077 --> 00:24:40,180
Alex...

552
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:50,181
Not too much to talk
about, just checking in.

553
00:24:50,191 --> 00:24:53,229
Always asking about the book.

554
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,120
"How's the book?

555
00:24:55,163 --> 00:24:56,003
How's the book going?

556
00:24:56,004 --> 00:24:58,111
How you doing
on the book?"

557
00:25:03,005 --> 00:25:07,145
Got to the point where I
was screening his calls.

558
00:25:14,784 --> 00:25:16,553
The taste in my
mouth, it's good.

559
00:25:17,553 --> 00:25:18,553
Agh!

560
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:42,377
Isn't it so funny how
we're all breathing under

561
00:25:42,378 --> 00:25:44,078
the same roof again.

562
00:25:45,381 --> 00:25:48,550
Do you ever wish we
could just go back?

563
00:25:48,551 --> 00:25:51,585
Sometimes.

564
00:25:51,586 --> 00:25:53,487
Actually, no I don't.

565
00:25:53,488 --> 00:25:54,922
I really don't.

566
00:25:54,923 --> 00:25:55,856
Why?

567
00:25:55,857 --> 00:25:56,891
Not at all.

568
00:25:56,892 --> 00:25:59,026
Because I...

569
00:25:59,027 --> 00:26:04,064
I don't know, I guess I
was mainly just scared.

570
00:26:04,065 --> 00:26:04,932
Of what?

571
00:26:04,933 --> 00:26:07,101
Of you all.

572
00:26:07,102 --> 00:26:09,137
The possibility that
you didn't like me.

573
00:26:09,138 --> 00:26:10,404
That's ridiculous.

574
00:26:10,405 --> 00:26:11,372
It's the truth.

575
00:26:11,373 --> 00:26:16,276
I remember that that
feeling did not go away.

576
00:26:16,277 --> 00:26:20,547
Until, um, until junior
year when Ben had me at

577
00:26:20,548 --> 00:26:24,485
his parents' place for Easter.

578
00:26:24,486 --> 00:26:26,153
We took the train
there and back.

579
00:26:26,154 --> 00:26:30,024
Barely talked, but you
know, it was, it was

580
00:26:30,025 --> 00:26:31,159
better than talking.

581
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:37,031
It was just...

582
00:26:37,032 --> 00:26:38,911
Just nice.

583
00:26:49,911 --> 00:26:52,613
Hm?

584
00:26:52,614 --> 00:26:56,618
I don't know how to say this.

585
00:26:56,619 --> 00:27:01,421
But, have you ever thought
about going to therapy?

586
00:27:01,422 --> 00:27:04,258
Because, I've done
it a lot, and...

587
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:04,794
You have?

588
00:27:04,994 --> 00:27:05,494
Yeah.

589
00:27:05,495 --> 00:27:08,129
Why?

590
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,063
Seriously?

591
00:27:09,064 --> 00:27:10,198
Yeah, you're fine.

592
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:16,237
Oh, um, let me think, how
I'm constantly anxious and

593
00:27:16,238 --> 00:27:21,074
I can never pinpoint why,
and how ever since college

594
00:27:21,075 --> 00:27:24,012
I can only be with guys
who are assholes or

595
00:27:24,013 --> 00:27:25,947
married or both...

596
00:27:25,948 --> 00:27:27,481
Has the therapy helped?

597
00:27:27,482 --> 00:27:29,484
I mean, I take Xanax now.

598
00:27:29,485 --> 00:27:33,454
That helps, and also, you
know, the other stuff is

599
00:27:33,455 --> 00:27:34,354
helpful.

600
00:27:34,355 --> 00:27:35,875
It's through, it's
complicated, though.

601
00:27:35,876 --> 00:27:38,426
My therapist kind of
thinks that it's very deep

602
00:27:38,427 --> 00:27:42,964
rooted in my childhood and...

603
00:27:42,965 --> 00:27:46,234
I'm s-sorry I'm
talking about myself.

604
00:27:46,235 --> 00:27:47,267
I'm so self-absorbed.

605
00:27:47,268 --> 00:27:48,436
This is why I'm in therapy.

606
00:27:48,437 --> 00:27:49,437
No it isn't!

607
00:27:49,438 --> 00:27:50,270
No it isn't.

608
00:27:50,271 --> 00:27:53,006
You just need sleep.

609
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:55,176
I know, but are you okay?

610
00:27:55,177 --> 00:27:58,112
Do you need something
right now before we go to sleep?

611
00:27:58,113 --> 00:28:02,050
Sarah, you're going to have
to stop asking me that, okay?

612
00:28:02,051 --> 00:28:04,352
Mmm...

613
00:28:04,353 --> 00:28:06,454
You're very nice.

614
00:28:06,455 --> 00:28:09,556
Well, I think you're doing
a really good job, and I'm

615
00:28:09,557 --> 00:28:11,926
just going to wait here
until you fall asleep.

616
00:28:18,066 --> 00:28:19,066
Alright, forget it.

617
00:28:21,103 --> 00:28:23,004
Good night, thank you.

618
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:24,706
I'm glad you're here.

619
00:28:24,707 --> 00:28:27,240
Isaac.

620
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:28,609
Isaac.

621
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:29,110
Isaac!

622
00:28:29,178 --> 00:28:30,244
Uh huh?

623
00:28:30,245 --> 00:28:31,645
You're awake?

624
00:28:31,646 --> 00:28:34,450
Unh...

625
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:38,652
What do you like about me?

626
00:28:38,653 --> 00:28:39,554
What?

627
00:28:39,555 --> 00:28:41,689
You waited too long.

628
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,592
Baby, it's the
middle of the light.

629
00:28:44,593 --> 00:28:46,473
Well now, now I can't
trust what you say because

630
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:49,529
it didn't just come to you.

631
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:53,468
Wait can we, can we just
talk about this in the morning?

632
00:28:53,469 --> 00:28:55,109
No, we can't talk about
it in the morning.

633
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:58,472
I think, I think your
friends think I'm...

634
00:28:58,473 --> 00:29:00,274
Stupid and young.

635
00:29:00,275 --> 00:29:02,275
They don't think you're
stupid or young.

636
00:29:02,276 --> 00:29:03,194
You're neither.

637
00:29:03,211 --> 00:29:04,277
Go back to sleep.

638
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:05,712
We'll talk about this tomorrow.

639
00:29:05,713 --> 00:29:08,288
But...

640
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:15,422
Oh, hey.

641
00:29:15,423 --> 00:29:17,124
Hi.

642
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:19,028
Oh, you know what I
wanted to tell you?

643
00:29:19,228 --> 00:29:20,468
What's that show that you like?

644
00:29:20,469 --> 00:29:23,031
The one with, with all the
ladies and they're in a city.

645
00:29:23,032 --> 00:29:24,032
What is it? What is that?

646
00:29:24,033 --> 00:29:24,900
The real housewives?

647
00:29:24,901 --> 00:29:25,866
- Yeah, I don't
- the real housewives.

648
00:29:25,867 --> 00:29:27,668
No, no, no, but I was
watching that show.

649
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:28,768
No you weren't.

650
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:31,805
No, it was on, and I was
there, and I couldn't look

651
00:29:31,806 --> 00:29:33,126
away, and do you
want to know why?

652
00:29:33,127 --> 00:29:34,042
Oh, shut up.

653
00:29:34,043 --> 00:29:35,410
Sarah, do you want to know why?

654
00:29:35,411 --> 00:29:38,079
Because I realized why you
love that show so much.

655
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,689
Because at its core, it's
about the human condition.

656
00:29:47,689 --> 00:29:48,355
No.

657
00:29:48,356 --> 00:29:49,669
What?

658
00:30:04,605 --> 00:30:06,574
I thought they hated each other.

659
00:30:06,575 --> 00:30:07,641
They do and they don't.

660
00:30:07,642 --> 00:30:09,611
It's like a weird
game they play.

661
00:30:10,746 --> 00:30:13,847
Your friends are fucked up.

662
00:30:13,848 --> 00:30:16,384
They prefer complicated.

663
00:30:20,588 --> 00:30:21,823
Sarah and Josh.

664
00:30:21,824 --> 00:30:29,702
Just like old times.

665
00:30:34,702 --> 00:30:37,138
I wonder why I let
this keep happening.

666
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:37,939
I don't know, Sarah.

667
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,574
Maybe because you want it to.

668
00:30:39,575 --> 00:30:42,543
No, it's just something
I think I want and then

669
00:30:42,544 --> 00:30:48,282
later I feel awful about.

670
00:30:48,283 --> 00:30:49,316
You alright?

671
00:30:49,317 --> 00:30:50,317
Yes.

672
00:30:50,318 --> 00:30:53,487
Are Ben and Siri acting
weird, or is it just me?

673
00:30:53,488 --> 00:30:55,156
It's just you.

674
00:30:55,157 --> 00:30:56,690
You think they heard us?

675
00:30:56,691 --> 00:30:57,824
How would I know?

676
00:30:57,825 --> 00:30:58,659
Well, I don't know.

677
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,428
She's a light
sleeper, that Siri.

678
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:01,661
And you're very loud.

679
00:31:01,662 --> 00:31:02,763
You've gotten louder.

680
00:31:02,764 --> 00:31:05,466
What is that supposed
to mean "she's a light sleeper?"

681
00:31:05,467 --> 00:31:06,534
Oh, I thought you were
talking about the fact

682
00:31:06,535 --> 00:31:07,435
that you got louder.

683
00:31:07,436 --> 00:31:09,871
I don't, you know,
remember in college with

684
00:31:09,872 --> 00:31:11,805
those dorky little
orange earbuds?

685
00:31:11,806 --> 00:31:13,908
And she will still
complain about being woken

686
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:16,143
up by the church bells?

687
00:31:16,144 --> 00:31:17,144
You're still in love with her.

688
00:31:17,145 --> 00:31:18,385
I'm not still in love with her.

689
00:31:18,386 --> 00:31:18,980
Yes you are.

690
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,248
I'm not still in
love with her, Sarah.

691
00:31:21,249 --> 00:31:24,252
I just find it fascinating
that Ben seems to get

692
00:31:24,253 --> 00:31:25,820
everything that
he wants in life?

693
00:31:25,821 --> 00:31:27,755
Can I ask you a question?

694
00:31:27,756 --> 00:31:29,516
Where do you get off
thinking the whole world

695
00:31:29,517 --> 00:31:30,886
is conspiring against you?

696
00:31:31,226 --> 00:31:32,560
You want to go again?

697
00:31:32,561 --> 00:31:33,326
No.

698
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:33,962
What?

699
00:31:34,162 --> 00:31:34,762
You're a dick.

700
00:31:34,763 --> 00:31:35,696
Yeah.

701
00:31:35,697 --> 00:31:37,331
All men are dicks, Sarah.

702
00:31:37,332 --> 00:31:38,632
We're hardwired that way.

703
00:31:38,633 --> 00:31:40,433
Yeah, but you're a dick
who thinks he's better

704
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:42,269
than a dick because he
can back up his dickish

705
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,872
behavior with psychobabble
and pseudoscience.

706
00:31:44,873 --> 00:31:46,306
Yeah, blah blah blah blah blah.

707
00:31:46,307 --> 00:31:47,240
Let's go again.

708
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:48,241
I don't want to.

709
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:49,962
I think it would be a
good idea to go again.

710
00:31:49,963 --> 00:31:51,245
You can't go again.

711
00:31:51,246 --> 00:31:52,366
I can go again.

712
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:23,443
<i>There are three stages
of finding friends in college.</i>

713
00:32:23,444 --> 00:32:25,645
<i>The first is desperation.</i>

714
00:32:25,646 --> 00:32:27,747
<i>Second is panic.</i>

715
00:32:27,748 --> 00:32:30,985
<i>The third is fate.</i>

716
00:32:30,986 --> 00:32:32,706
<i>When you wind up at
the same table together</i>

717
00:32:32,707 --> 00:32:35,433
<i>somehow, then your
real life begins.</i>

718
00:32:58,313 --> 00:32:59,815
Busted!

719
00:33:02,985 --> 00:33:04,619
Does everyone else know.

720
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,653
Paper-thin walls.

721
00:33:06,654 --> 00:33:09,856
Perfect.

722
00:33:09,857 --> 00:33:11,993
No one is judging.

723
00:33:11,994 --> 00:33:14,394
Ugh, besides me.

724
00:33:14,395 --> 00:33:18,266
It's like I'm this mature,
successful, adult woman,

725
00:33:18,267 --> 00:33:20,147
except when I'm with Josh,
it's like I'm back in

726
00:33:20,148 --> 00:33:22,902
sophomore year and I'm
just total insecure, and...

727
00:33:22,903 --> 00:33:23,804
It's complicated.

728
00:33:23,805 --> 00:33:25,640
He was your first.

729
00:33:25,641 --> 00:33:26,841
It's not complicated.

730
00:33:26,842 --> 00:33:28,008
He's using me.

731
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:30,378
Who's to say you
aren't using him?

732
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:32,747
My therapist, actually.

733
00:33:32,748 --> 00:33:36,784
Josh is a man-child who
uses sex, I'm serious, as

734
00:33:36,785 --> 00:33:40,321
a means of processing
deep-seated emotional issues.

735
00:33:40,322 --> 00:33:42,657
And you are an overworked
tax attorney who could

736
00:33:42,658 --> 00:33:43,690
stand to get laid.

737
00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:45,660
I'm a...

738
00:33:45,661 --> 00:33:47,581
Mergers and acquisitions
attorney who could stand

739
00:33:47,582 --> 00:33:49,529
to get laid, thank you.

740
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,297
Whatever.

741
00:33:50,298 --> 00:33:51,439
Are you still...

742
00:33:57,439 --> 00:33:58,906
With...

743
00:33:58,907 --> 00:34:03,015
I think I might be a little...

744
00:34:07,015 --> 00:34:08,516
What?

745
00:34:08,517 --> 00:34:10,418
You don't run.

746
00:34:10,419 --> 00:34:11,819
Well, I'm thinking
of picking it up.

747
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,120
Alex, you're still recovering.

748
00:34:13,121 --> 00:34:14,421
Why don't you take it easy?

749
00:34:14,422 --> 00:34:17,325
I can always stop.

750
00:34:17,326 --> 00:34:20,695
I have been trying to get
motivated all morning.

751
00:34:20,696 --> 00:34:21,695
Come with me.

752
00:34:21,696 --> 00:34:23,930
Yeah?

753
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:25,398
How'd you sleep?

754
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:26,733
Fine, why?

755
00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:28,468
Really?

756
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:30,509
Just wanted to make
sure you weren't being attacked.

757
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:33,840
- There was a lot of...
- God.

758
00:34:33,841 --> 00:34:34,974
So how's Brooklyn?

759
00:34:34,975 --> 00:34:36,577
It's fine.

760
00:34:36,578 --> 00:34:38,012
Come visit.

761
00:34:38,013 --> 00:34:39,547
Sorry, sorry sorry.

762
00:34:40,681 --> 00:34:41,816
You okay?

763
00:34:41,817 --> 00:34:45,885
Yeah.

764
00:34:45,886 --> 00:34:48,688
You'd better be fine.

765
00:34:48,689 --> 00:34:52,559
I um, I saw the pictures
you posted the other day.

766
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,595
Yeah?

767
00:34:53,596 --> 00:34:55,516
Uh, were you and Ben went
to all the thrift shops

768
00:34:55,517 --> 00:34:56,063
and...

769
00:34:56,064 --> 00:34:58,465
Made your place
look so home-like?

770
00:34:58,466 --> 00:34:59,633
Yeah.

771
00:34:59,634 --> 00:35:01,101
Yeah I did.

772
00:35:01,102 --> 00:35:04,607
Now all you need is
a golden retriever.

773
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:09,809
What?

774
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,845
What's going on?

775
00:35:11,846 --> 00:35:13,747
I got a job offer in LA.

776
00:35:13,748 --> 00:35:15,148
<i>Alright!</i>

777
00:35:15,149 --> 00:35:16,717
It's a dream kind of offer.

778
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:19,086
That's great.

779
00:35:19,087 --> 00:35:23,657
So then what's the bad news?

780
00:35:23,658 --> 00:35:26,760
Ben's been resisting
at every turn.

781
00:35:26,761 --> 00:35:29,796
Fighting a lot about
going, fighting about

782
00:35:29,797 --> 00:35:33,867
staying, just, we haven't
even made love in...

783
00:35:33,868 --> 00:35:35,101
Weeks, and.

784
00:35:35,102 --> 00:35:37,171
Didn't need to know that part.

785
00:35:37,172 --> 00:35:40,576
I'm sorry, I...

786
00:35:41,498 --> 00:35:44,077
I just think some space
would be good for us both.

787
00:35:44,078 --> 00:35:46,884
Wait, wait, no, no, um...

788
00:35:48,884 --> 00:35:51,485
You and Ben are
going to be fine.

789
00:35:51,486 --> 00:35:52,420
Okay?

790
00:35:52,421 --> 00:35:54,101
Ben's probably just
stressed out right now.

791
00:35:54,102 --> 00:35:55,034
He'll figure it out.

792
00:35:55,035 --> 00:35:57,858
He'll finish his book and...

793
00:35:57,859 --> 00:35:59,827
What?

794
00:35:59,828 --> 00:36:02,829
Ben is...

795
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:08,034
Well, for starters he's blocked.

796
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:10,037
Blocked?

797
00:36:10,038 --> 00:36:14,642
Please, don't say
anything, obviously.

798
00:36:14,643 --> 00:36:16,907
He hasn't written
anything in almost a year.

799
00:36:21,783 --> 00:36:24,050
Ha ha, look who it is.

800
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:26,019
It's about time, you lazy bum.

801
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,588
Lazy?

802
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:31,727
It's not like you let
me sleep, you and Sarah.

803
00:36:32,727 --> 00:36:34,628
How's Siri?

804
00:36:34,629 --> 00:36:37,731
Siri...

805
00:36:37,732 --> 00:36:39,700
Is on a run.

806
00:36:39,701 --> 00:36:41,674
Okay.

807
00:36:45,674 --> 00:36:46,674
And she's back.

808
00:36:47,209 --> 00:36:50,010
Ben, can I ask you something?

809
00:36:50,011 --> 00:36:55,182
Was it difficult, as a couple,
when the iPhone 4s came out?

810
00:36:55,183 --> 00:36:58,818
Because I can imagine,
here you are, minding your

811
00:36:58,819 --> 00:37:06,194
own business, and then everybody's
asking her a question.

812
00:37:07,194 --> 00:37:09,167
You're a fucking idiot.

813
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:12,999
<i>Just a second!</i>

814
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Oh.

815
00:37:19,975 --> 00:37:20,907
It's all yours.

816
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:21,709
Thank you.

817
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,011
Hey, um...

818
00:37:24,011 --> 00:37:26,613
I'm sorry about what
I said last night.

819
00:37:26,614 --> 00:37:27,114
I'm...

820
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:28,249
It's okay.

821
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,383
Don't worry.

822
00:37:29,384 --> 00:37:31,751
You're not even 48 hours
removed from a traumatic event.

823
00:37:31,752 --> 00:37:34,072
You're suddenly the center
of love and attention and you're

824
00:37:34,073 --> 00:37:36,023
feeling mildly manic
and also oddly angry.

825
00:37:36,024 --> 00:37:37,864
I imagine you're also
experiencing mood-cycling

826
00:37:37,865 --> 00:37:39,785
and you're scared as hell
of the next time you'll

827
00:37:39,786 --> 00:37:40,927
crash, so, no.

828
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:42,665
I'm not taking it personally.

829
00:37:43,665 --> 00:37:44,165
Good.

830
00:37:44,232 --> 00:37:45,633
Don't worry, though.

831
00:37:45,634 --> 00:37:47,881
You'll level off.

832
00:37:59,881 --> 00:38:02,115
What, uh...

833
00:38:02,116 --> 00:38:03,851
What style of yoga is that?

834
00:38:03,852 --> 00:38:06,189
What, what form is that?

835
00:38:09,189 --> 00:38:12,726
I took a yoga class once.

836
00:38:12,727 --> 00:38:14,877
Yeah, but it wasn't for me.

837
00:38:29,877 --> 00:38:31,948
No, yeah, uh, mhmm.

838
00:38:33,948 --> 00:38:35,633
I'm going to give
you some space.

839
00:38:39,321 --> 00:38:40,427
You know what I miss?

840
00:38:40,428 --> 00:38:42,722
I miss living down
the hall from you.

841
00:38:42,723 --> 00:38:45,025
I could always pop over
whenever I wanted to talk.

842
00:38:45,026 --> 00:38:46,726
You just hate sleeping
alone and you needed

843
00:38:46,727 --> 00:38:48,929
somebody to talk to about Josh.

844
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:50,664
Don't be naive.

845
00:38:50,665 --> 00:38:55,034
Don't be naive about what?

846
00:38:55,035 --> 00:38:56,670
Isaac...

847
00:38:56,671 --> 00:38:58,871
Sarah...

848
00:38:58,872 --> 00:39:02,210
I always wanted
you to make a move.

849
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,614
That's funny.

850
00:39:06,614 --> 00:39:09,717
I'm serious.

851
00:39:09,718 --> 00:39:11,052
But you always,

852
00:39:11,053 --> 00:39:14,655
you always said that we shouldn't
because were such good friends.

853
00:39:14,656 --> 00:39:19,726
Oh, yes, that is what I
said, but that is not what

854
00:39:19,727 --> 00:39:20,727
I wanted.

855
00:39:22,046 --> 00:39:23,731
You're impossible,
you know that?

856
00:39:23,732 --> 00:39:24,465
I'm impossible?

857
00:39:24,466 --> 00:39:26,099
Yeah, you're totally impossible.

858
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,967
You're impossible!

859
00:39:27,968 --> 00:39:29,670
Shit!

860
00:39:29,671 --> 00:39:30,705
Sorry that...

861
00:39:33,608 --> 00:39:34,608
Oh, is that butter?

862
00:39:34,609 --> 00:39:36,089
No no no, don't wipe
it off, I got it.

863
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,450
- It's cream right there.
- Cheese.

864
00:39:37,451 --> 00:39:39,399
It's cream cheese! Perfect!
Thank you.

865
00:39:39,747 --> 00:39:41,116
I'm gonna go wash up babe.

866
00:39:43,917 --> 00:39:45,151
Morning.

867
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,158
Good morning.

868
00:39:51,158 --> 00:39:54,695
I've got great
Southern exposure, so I

869
00:39:54,696 --> 00:39:56,764
was thinking of
installing a solar array.

870
00:39:56,765 --> 00:40:00,434
And um, maybe a few
rainwater basins too.

871
00:40:00,435 --> 00:40:01,568
That sounds great, Alex.

872
00:40:01,569 --> 00:40:03,970
Then you'd have everything
you need to start a cult.

873
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:06,106
I'm in.

874
00:40:06,107 --> 00:40:08,809
Hey, what do you think the
girls are doing right now?

875
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,943
I don't know, their hair?

876
00:40:10,944 --> 00:40:13,380
What if we propose
an elaborate swap.

877
00:40:13,381 --> 00:40:15,048
Yeah, I think you'd be thrilled.

878
00:40:15,049 --> 00:40:16,784
The numbers aren't even.

879
00:40:16,785 --> 00:40:17,784
Ow!

880
00:40:17,785 --> 00:40:18,905
The numbers are plenty even.

881
00:40:18,906 --> 00:40:20,387
I've done, look...

882
00:40:20,388 --> 00:40:22,956
Alex, you get sweet nubile Kate.

883
00:40:22,957 --> 00:40:24,191
Oh great.

884
00:40:24,192 --> 00:40:25,291
Isaac, you get Sarah.

885
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:27,212
I get Siri, 'cause, well,
that's all that's left.

886
00:40:27,213 --> 00:40:30,430
And Ben, you get published
in the new yorker.

887
00:40:30,431 --> 00:40:31,435
That's hilarious.

888
00:40:37,906 --> 00:40:38,906
The fuck was that?

889
00:40:39,207 --> 00:40:41,710
I don't know, a dog?

890
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,914
Well, the boys better be
close, or they're gonna

891
00:40:46,915 --> 00:40:48,282
get drenched.

892
00:40:48,283 --> 00:40:50,883
You want to go on a food run?

893
00:40:50,884 --> 00:40:52,324
I've just been
feeling a little sick.

894
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:54,921
I'll go.

895
00:40:54,922 --> 00:40:56,055
Oh, would you?

896
00:40:56,056 --> 00:40:57,157
<i>Yeah.</i>

897
00:40:57,158 --> 00:40:58,925
Great.

898
00:40:58,926 --> 00:41:01,095
Would you, uh, pick
something up for me?

899
00:41:01,096 --> 00:41:03,097
Yes.

900
00:41:03,098 --> 00:41:03,930
- Now?
- Yeah.

901
00:41:03,931 --> 00:41:05,164
Let's go.

902
00:41:05,165 --> 00:41:06,099
Cool.

903
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,001
Have fun!

904
00:41:08,002 --> 00:41:10,003
Boy, where'd you come from?

905
00:41:10,004 --> 00:41:12,371
There aren't that
many houses over here.

906
00:41:12,372 --> 00:41:15,342
Hello?

907
00:41:15,343 --> 00:41:17,846
Anyone lose a dog?

908
00:41:18,846 --> 00:41:20,481
She looks hungry.

909
00:41:20,482 --> 00:41:21,362
You want some of that?

910
00:41:21,363 --> 00:41:22,563
Whoa, what are you doing, man?

911
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:23,983
You don't feed a strange dog.

912
00:41:23,984 --> 00:41:25,052
Why not?

913
00:41:25,053 --> 00:41:26,019
Cause you'll just confuse
it and make everything

914
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:26,987
worse.

915
00:41:26,988 --> 00:41:28,387
That's bullshit.

916
00:41:28,388 --> 00:41:30,348
Hey, look, as much as I
want to hang out with this

917
00:41:30,349 --> 00:41:33,392
dog all day long, um, has anyone
else noticed it's pouring?

918
00:41:33,393 --> 00:41:34,894
We can't just leave it here.

919
00:41:34,895 --> 00:41:36,335
Owner should've put
some tags on him.

920
00:41:36,336 --> 00:41:37,396
Owner should've what?

921
00:41:37,397 --> 00:41:39,432
Let me see your pen.

922
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:42,381
Okay, so the dog should be
punished for its owner's sins?

923
00:41:43,504 --> 00:41:46,173
Are you a republican now?

924
00:41:46,174 --> 00:41:48,175
So what if I am?

925
00:41:48,176 --> 00:41:52,546
So what if, what?

926
00:41:52,547 --> 00:41:55,381
Ben, did he tell you about this?

927
00:41:55,382 --> 00:41:56,950
Yum, grape...

928
00:41:56,951 --> 00:41:58,284
Hey, will this work?

929
00:41:58,285 --> 00:42:02,555
Uh, oh God no, that's not good.

930
00:42:02,556 --> 00:42:05,459
So, when did you and Isaac meet?

931
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,492
Freshman year.

932
00:42:06,493 --> 00:42:08,427
He lived down the hall from me.

933
00:42:08,428 --> 00:42:10,863
I was so nervous to
come on this trip.

934
00:42:10,864 --> 00:42:11,731
Really?

935
00:42:11,732 --> 00:42:13,934
Isaac looks up to
you guys so much.

936
00:42:13,935 --> 00:42:15,401
It's like...

937
00:42:15,402 --> 00:42:17,470
Meeting his parents but
worse, because there's

938
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,472
five of you.

939
00:42:18,473 --> 00:42:21,141
Well, be thankful you're
not meeting his parents.

940
00:42:21,142 --> 00:42:27,581
His mom is crazy.

941
00:42:27,582 --> 00:42:31,050
I'm so jealous of you.

942
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:32,052
Why?

943
00:42:32,053 --> 00:42:34,521
Because, you guys just
have all these shared

944
00:42:34,522 --> 00:42:37,356
experiences that
I'll never have.

945
00:42:37,357 --> 00:42:38,992
Well, you know Isaac.

946
00:42:38,993 --> 00:42:40,193
He was...

947
00:42:40,194 --> 00:42:42,563
Shy and sweet.

948
00:42:42,564 --> 00:42:43,564
Really sweet.

949
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:46,532
He's the only one of us
from the Midwest, so...

950
00:42:46,533 --> 00:42:50,436
He's the least neurotic
of the bunch by far.

951
00:42:50,437 --> 00:42:52,072
I can see that.

952
00:42:52,073 --> 00:42:53,072
Yeah.

953
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:54,993
He takes me out to fancy
dinners all the time and

954
00:42:54,994 --> 00:43:00,034
it's really nice, but
it's not why I like him.

955
00:43:00,582 --> 00:43:02,249
Why do you like him?

956
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:05,251
Because he's grounded.

957
00:43:05,252 --> 00:43:06,452
And he's so kind.

958
00:43:06,453 --> 00:43:08,387
And...

959
00:43:08,388 --> 00:43:09,668
The other day, we celebrated our

960
00:43:09,669 --> 00:43:11,490
quarter-year anniversary.

961
00:43:11,491 --> 00:43:12,544
Which is ridiculous.

962
00:43:13,227 --> 00:43:14,262
It's so ridiculous.

963
00:43:14,263 --> 00:43:18,999
But it made me really
happy, and I think he's

964
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,238
got the right priorities,
which is rare.

965
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:25,438
Everything okay.

966
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:26,907
Yeah.

967
00:43:26,908 --> 00:43:29,309
Ugh! So many mushrooms.

968
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,577
Ooh, watermelon.

969
00:43:30,578 --> 00:43:32,218
There you are.

970
00:43:37,218 --> 00:43:39,019
Hey, big news.

971
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:39,987
What?

972
00:43:39,988 --> 00:43:41,555
Isaac voted for bush.

973
00:43:41,556 --> 00:43:43,322
That's not the news.

974
00:43:43,323 --> 00:43:45,559
We found a dog.

975
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,327
Oh my God.

976
00:43:48,328 --> 00:43:50,030
Where did you guys find it?

977
00:43:50,031 --> 00:43:52,164
At the river in the woods.

978
00:43:52,165 --> 00:43:53,901
I'm going to go take a shower.

979
00:43:53,902 --> 00:43:56,222
Alex, hold on, would you give
me one second, I can come in.

980
00:43:56,223 --> 00:43:57,237
What, what, what, what?

981
00:43:57,238 --> 00:43:59,338
You're gonna come with
me and, and bathe me?

982
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:00,699
That's not what I
was going to say.

983
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:04,144
Okay, I'm fucking fine, okay?

984
00:44:04,145 --> 00:44:05,145
Okay?

985
00:44:05,212 --> 00:44:06,212
Everybody, I...

986
00:44:06,214 --> 00:44:08,548
Thank you for your
concern, but I am fucking

987
00:44:08,549 --> 00:44:12,019
fine, and just please,
stop following me around,

988
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,656
okay?

989
00:44:15,656 --> 00:44:20,293
What do we do?

990
00:44:20,294 --> 00:44:22,362
He said he's fucking fine.

991
00:44:22,363 --> 00:44:23,843
I'm going to check
on him in a minute.

992
00:44:23,844 --> 00:44:26,233
You know, I think he is, okay?

993
00:44:26,234 --> 00:44:28,968
How do you know?

994
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:30,674
I just know.

995
00:44:32,674 --> 00:44:34,006
Hey.

996
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:34,675
Ha!

997
00:44:34,676 --> 00:44:36,476
Sweet nectar and ambrosia.

998
00:44:36,477 --> 00:44:37,978
There's more in the car.

999
00:44:37,979 --> 00:44:39,515
Oh my gosh!

1000
00:44:40,515 --> 00:44:42,182
Who is this!

1001
00:44:42,183 --> 00:44:43,050
You know Josh.

1002
00:44:43,051 --> 00:44:46,087
He makes friends
everywhere he goes.

1003
00:44:47,087 --> 00:44:48,988
I missed you.

1004
00:44:48,989 --> 00:44:53,194
I missed you too.

1005
00:45:01,569 --> 00:45:02,668
Jeff Goldblum.

1006
00:45:02,669 --> 00:45:03,470
Done.

1007
00:45:03,471 --> 00:45:04,438
Jeff Goldblum!

1008
00:45:04,439 --> 00:45:06,039
Yeah.

1009
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,474
The dog was in the fly?

1010
00:45:07,475 --> 00:45:08,441
I think it's good.

1011
00:45:08,442 --> 00:45:09,976
You don't name
a dog "Jeff."

1012
00:45:09,977 --> 00:45:11,378
Why would it be
named Jeff Goldblum?

1013
00:45:11,379 --> 00:45:13,699
It wouldn't be named Jeff,
it would be named Jeff Goldblum.

1014
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,580
How do you know the dog
is Jewish, first of all?

1015
00:45:15,581 --> 00:45:15,916
How did you just assume?

1016
00:45:16,116 --> 00:45:17,196
How did you make that call?

1017
00:45:17,197 --> 00:45:19,385
That's the dog's name. You're
welcome.

1018
00:45:19,386 --> 00:45:20,653
Jeff Goldblum.

1019
00:45:20,654 --> 00:45:23,356
Then name the dog, please.

1020
00:45:23,357 --> 00:45:25,291
I think he likes the name Timmy.

1021
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:26,392
Timmy, you're good, huh?

1022
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:27,593
Timmy's a good name.

1023
00:45:27,594 --> 00:45:30,030
Come here, come here, come here.

1024
00:45:30,031 --> 00:45:31,700
Shh, shh.

1025
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,535
Wait, hold on guys, seriously.

1026
00:45:35,636 --> 00:45:37,637
I think I can hear
Timmy's thoughts.

1027
00:45:37,638 --> 00:45:41,641
Gee, I sure am glad I'm inside
right now.

1028
00:45:41,642 --> 00:45:44,116
Instead of being out there
in the cold and rain.

1029
00:45:44,316 --> 00:45:46,472
The mean man with the
effeminate shoes didn't

1030
00:45:46,473 --> 00:45:47,246
want me to come.

1031
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:48,782
Hey!

1032
00:45:48,783 --> 00:45:50,550
Timmy would kill
for these shoes.

1033
00:45:50,551 --> 00:45:53,452
But I'll bite his ass later.

1034
00:45:53,453 --> 00:45:56,356
Why do we just assume
that dogs talk like that?

1035
00:45:56,357 --> 00:45:58,277
I mean, it's not like a
dog just opened his mouth

1036
00:45:58,278 --> 00:46:00,126
one day and that's what
it sounded like and we

1037
00:46:00,127 --> 00:46:01,765
assigned that voice to it.

1038
00:46:04,765 --> 00:46:06,266
Ignore them, Timmy.

1039
00:46:06,267 --> 00:46:06,934
Timmy?

1040
00:46:07,134 --> 00:46:08,134
That's his name.

1041
00:46:09,486 --> 00:46:11,171
Hey, I just thought
of something.

1042
00:46:11,172 --> 00:46:12,171
What?

1043
00:46:12,172 --> 00:46:14,074
Um, I told Siri earlier
how much I loved your

1044
00:46:14,075 --> 00:46:16,443
place, and all you guys
were missing was a dog,

1045
00:46:16,444 --> 00:46:18,278
and now...

1046
00:46:18,279 --> 00:46:19,646
One appears!

1047
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:21,616
You have your chance.

1048
00:46:22,616 --> 00:46:24,517
We're not getting a dog.

1049
00:46:24,518 --> 00:46:25,485
Siri, it's not a dog.

1050
00:46:25,486 --> 00:46:26,485
It's Timmy.

1051
00:46:26,486 --> 00:46:28,021
<i>Yeah.</i>

1052
00:46:28,022 --> 00:46:31,525
I'm not just a dog, I need a
house, and I like you

1053
00:46:31,526 --> 00:46:34,360
guys the best.

1054
00:46:34,361 --> 00:46:35,761
<i>You guys have that
little backyard.</i>

1055
00:46:35,762 --> 00:46:37,097
It can run back and forth...

1056
00:46:37,098 --> 00:46:38,064
Yeah.

1057
00:46:38,065 --> 00:46:40,733
Timmy, where do you want to go?

1058
00:46:40,734 --> 00:46:43,537
He says, he says
he wants it too.

1059
00:46:43,538 --> 00:46:45,373
That's too bad.

1060
00:46:46,373 --> 00:46:48,775
So, uh, what are
we making Sarah?

1061
00:46:48,776 --> 00:46:54,280
We are making chilled
watermelon soup and sea scallop

1062
00:46:54,281 --> 00:46:55,247
Risotto.

1063
00:46:55,248 --> 00:46:55,748
<i>What?</i>

1064
00:46:55,917 --> 00:46:56,957
<i>What are we making again?</i>

1065
00:46:56,958 --> 00:46:58,558
<i>I'm sorry, can you
do something helpful?</i>

1066
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,485
Did you say Risotto?

1067
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:01,655
Can you please do
something helpful?

1068
00:47:01,656 --> 00:47:03,824
The joint's not going
to roll itself, Sarah.

1069
00:47:03,825 --> 00:47:06,126
And I'm making a magical
appetizer dish that's

1070
00:47:06,127 --> 00:47:09,162
going to make your
Risotto so much better.

1071
00:47:09,163 --> 00:47:10,363
Alright, please?

1072
00:47:10,364 --> 00:47:11,431
Please what?

1073
00:47:14,268 --> 00:47:15,534
Uh oh.

1074
00:47:15,535 --> 00:47:18,271
What?

1075
00:47:18,272 --> 00:47:20,372
Give me a break, I'm
not listening to that.

1076
00:47:20,373 --> 00:47:21,842
What?

1077
00:47:21,843 --> 00:47:24,311
It's like we're gripped by
this never-ending nostalgia

1078
00:47:24,312 --> 00:47:26,813
for our parents' music.

1079
00:47:26,814 --> 00:47:29,115
It's oppressive.

1080
00:47:29,116 --> 00:47:31,151
What about Bruce
Springsteen is oppressive?

1081
00:47:31,152 --> 00:47:33,112
Let me tell you something
about Bruce Springsteen,

1082
00:47:33,113 --> 00:47:33,353
okay?

1083
00:47:33,354 --> 00:47:35,621
Never, never trust anyone
who is that passionate

1084
00:47:35,622 --> 00:47:37,824
about the state of New Jersey.

1085
00:47:37,825 --> 00:47:39,659
<i>You are so full of shit.</i>

1086
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:42,295
<i>Okay.</i>

1087
00:47:42,296 --> 00:47:42,796
Hmm?

1088
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:43,823
What is he gonna do now.

1089
00:47:43,824 --> 00:47:46,166
What've we got.

1090
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:47,334
Arcade fire?

1091
00:47:47,335 --> 00:47:48,568
Yes. Arcade fucking fire.

1092
00:47:48,569 --> 00:47:49,069
What?

1093
00:47:49,136 --> 00:47:50,436
What's wrong with this.

1094
00:47:50,437 --> 00:47:52,238
Too Canadian.

1095
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:54,273
What does that mean?

1096
00:47:54,274 --> 00:47:56,510
Too Canadian, really?

1097
00:47:56,511 --> 00:47:57,843
Does, does this
look too Canadian?

1098
00:47:57,844 --> 00:47:58,811
Really?

1099
00:47:58,812 --> 00:47:59,746
But who knows.

1100
00:47:59,747 --> 00:48:00,680
I don't know.

1101
00:48:00,681 --> 00:48:02,581
Maybe it fits our
postmodern profile for a

1102
00:48:02,582 --> 00:48:05,385
Canadian band to best
express American anxiety

1103
00:48:05,386 --> 00:48:08,454
during this gradual
post-empire period of decline.

1104
00:48:08,455 --> 00:48:11,191
Blah, blah, blah,
bullshit, blah.

1105
00:48:11,192 --> 00:48:12,925
Miss Kate?

1106
00:48:12,926 --> 00:48:15,729
Oh I don't,
I don't normally smoke.

1107
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:19,699
Honey, it's not going to bite.

1108
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,867
Okay.

1109
00:48:20,868 --> 00:48:22,936
Fine.

1110
00:48:22,937 --> 00:48:25,774
<i>I like Kate.</i>

1111
00:48:27,774 --> 00:48:29,547
There you go.

1112
00:48:32,547 --> 00:48:33,547
<i>Alright.</i>

1113
00:48:39,453 --> 00:48:41,521
<i>Alex, where did you
get these records?</i>

1114
00:48:41,522 --> 00:48:43,490
<i>I feel like I'm
at a garage sale.</i>

1115
00:48:43,491 --> 00:48:46,497
I, I bought them at a garage
sale.

1116
00:48:49,497 --> 00:48:51,597
Babe?

1117
00:48:51,598 --> 00:48:53,669
I'm okay.

1118
00:48:54,669 --> 00:48:56,802
What's going on?

1119
00:48:56,803 --> 00:48:58,704
Come on...

1120
00:48:58,705 --> 00:49:00,840
Look, if now is not the
time to get fucked up, I

1121
00:49:00,841 --> 00:49:04,677
really, I don't.. I
don't know when is.

1122
00:49:04,678 --> 00:49:05,878
<i>Fuck it.</i>

1123
00:49:05,879 --> 00:49:06,880
I'm dancing.

1124
00:49:06,881 --> 00:49:08,914
I'm gonna dance too.

1125
00:49:08,915 --> 00:49:10,282
Oh, here we go.

1126
00:49:10,283 --> 00:49:15,255
You should prepare
yourself for this.

1127
00:49:15,256 --> 00:49:16,941
This is what you
call a home run.

1128
00:49:17,225 --> 00:49:18,699
- Turn it up!
- That's right.

1129
00:49:22,395 --> 00:49:25,664
See that? Isaac,
who's the dancer now?

1130
00:49:25,665 --> 00:49:28,534
That's right Kate, Isaac
don't know these moves.

1131
00:49:28,535 --> 00:49:30,114
He won't show you these moves.

1132
00:49:45,685 --> 00:49:46,519
Hello.

1133
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,387
What is up?

1134
00:49:48,388 --> 00:49:49,990
This looks terrible.

1135
00:49:49,991 --> 00:49:52,525
Thanks.

1136
00:49:52,526 --> 00:49:58,631
How serious were
you this morning?

1137
00:49:58,632 --> 00:50:00,566
About what?

1138
00:50:00,567 --> 00:50:03,769
You know what.

1139
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:07,907
I just thought...

1140
00:50:07,908 --> 00:50:10,010
No, you know what, I'm
sorry I said anything.

1141
00:50:10,011 --> 00:50:12,579
I shouldn't have said anything.

1142
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:15,750
I'm not sorry.

1143
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:17,750
I'm not sorry.

1144
00:50:23,491 --> 00:50:25,724
- Okay, then...
- Isaac!

1145
00:50:25,725 --> 00:50:26,526
Yeah.

1146
00:50:26,527 --> 00:50:28,061
Get your anti-government
ass in here.

1147
00:50:28,062 --> 00:50:29,866
Come on.

1148
00:50:32,767 --> 00:50:38,839
I gotta go show those
fools how to dance.

What's up?

1153
00:51:18,645 --> 00:51:19,945
Nothing.

1154
00:51:19,946 --> 00:51:22,048
Nothing?

1155
00:51:22,049 --> 00:51:23,951
Since when do you
turn down a joint?

1156
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:28,497
I'm just not in the mood.

1157
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:38,430

00:51:45,506 --> 00:51:48,041
It should just be about us.

1162
00:51:48,042 --> 00:51:50,044
Really.

1163
00:51:51,044 --> 00:51:55,749

1165
00:51:59,719 --> 00:52:00,686
I don't know.

1166
00:52:00,687 --> 00:52:01,755
Are you sure?

1167
00:52:01,756 --> 00:52:03,889
No, I'm not sure.

1168
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:05,492
Just...

1169
00:52:05,493 --> 00:52:07,026
Feeling.

1170
00:52:07,027 --> 00:52:10,131
I got a test today, but...

1171
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:14,535
What does that look mean?

1172
00:52:15,502 --> 00:52:18,438
I'm, um...

1173
00:52:18,439 --> 00:52:22,008
I'm imagining a baby that
looks half like you and

1174
00:52:22,009 --> 00:52:25,845
half like me.

1175
00:52:25,846 --> 00:52:26,845
That tends to happen.

1176
00:52:26,846 --> 00:52:31,654
No.

1177
00:52:34,654 --> 00:52:36,889
What if I moved to LA?

1178
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:38,825
I mean, sure when I got
there I'd be unemployed

1179
00:52:38,826 --> 00:52:42,128
and probably have to bus
tables or whatever those

1180
00:52:42,129 --> 00:52:45,063
people in LA do until they...

1181
00:52:45,064 --> 00:52:46,566
Make better money, but...

00:52:46,567 --> 00:52:49,468
And please don't say that
if you don't mean it.

1183
00:52:49,469 --> 00:52:52,938
Of course I mean it.

1184
00:52:52,939 --> 00:52:56,709
All I'm saying is let's try.

1185
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:58,978
You want to try with me?

1186
00:52:58,979 --> 00:52:59,912
Yeah.

1187
00:52:59,913 --> 00:53:02,148
Yeah?

1188
00:53:02,149 --> 00:53:04,491

You guys!

1194
00:53:47,027 --> 00:53:49,196
Thank you.

1195
00:53:50,196 --> 00:53:52,569
Wow.

1196
00:53:56,569 --> 00:53:59,613
Mm.

1197
00:54:05,613 --> 00:54:09,014
This food is so
incredible, Sarah.

1198
00:54:09,015 --> 00:54:10,017
Oh God.

1199
00:54:12,785 --> 00:54:14,586
You guys, you're welcome.

1200
00:54:14,587 --> 00:54:15,987
You are incredibly
stoned right now.

1201
00:54:15,988 --> 00:54:17,388
I would just like
to point that out.

1202
00:54:17,389 --> 00:54:19,959
Sarah, we are barely high.

1203
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,528
Come on.

1204
00:54:21,529 --> 00:54:25,564
Okay, some of us
might be a little high.

1205
00:54:25,565 --> 00:54:26,266
Oh, sweetie.

1206
00:54:26,267 --> 00:54:28,267
Oh, I'm sorry.

1207
00:54:28,268 --> 00:54:31,304
I just really like how
cold it feels on my tongue.

1208
00:54:31,305 --> 00:54:32,438
Okay.

1209
00:54:32,439 --> 00:54:33,606
How come you haven't opened
up your own restaurant yet?

1210
00:54:33,607 --> 00:54:34,740
What's the deal?

1211
00:54:34,741 --> 00:54:37,843
Mm, it's called
law school loans.

1212
00:54:37,844 --> 00:54:40,179
How come we didn't do
more drugs in college?

1213
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:41,246
That's a good question.

1214
00:54:41,247 --> 00:54:43,782
I figured that I would be
far less curious now if I

1215
00:54:43,783 --> 00:54:47,754
had just done a better job of
doing more drugs in college.

1216
00:54:49,256 --> 00:54:51,496
Well, you know we had a
good run freshman year.

1217
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:53,559
Mhmm.

1218
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,961
You remember that time
Siri ate that weed brownie

1219
00:54:55,962 --> 00:54:58,030
and ran through someone's
yard buck-naked?

1220
00:54:58,031 --> 00:54:59,197
Stop it!

1221
00:54:59,198 --> 00:55:00,833
Oh touchy!

1222
00:55:00,834 --> 00:55:01,834
It's true! You did!

1223
00:55:01,835 --> 00:55:03,001
Stop it!

1224
00:55:03,002 --> 00:55:05,171
What happened to us?

1225
00:55:05,172 --> 00:55:06,606
We got serious.

1226
00:55:06,607 --> 00:55:07,487
And we got girlfriend.

1227
00:55:07,488 --> 00:55:09,075
Oh, hey, okay.

1228
00:55:09,076 --> 00:55:11,577
You know what this is like?

1229
00:55:11,578 --> 00:55:13,845
This is like one of
those '80s movies.

1230
00:55:13,846 --> 00:55:14,847
<i>What?</i>

1231
00:55:14,848 --> 00:55:16,014
Like one of those movies
where there's like a big

1232
00:55:16,015 --> 00:55:17,316
group of people...

1233
00:55:17,317 --> 00:55:19,151
I just don't see why
everything in our lives

1234
00:55:19,152 --> 00:55:21,653
has to be like something else.

1235
00:55:21,654 --> 00:55:22,921
That's real deep Siri.

1236
00:55:22,922 --> 00:55:23,923
I'm serious.

1237
00:55:23,924 --> 00:55:25,804
It's like we can't just
experience something and

1238
00:55:25,805 --> 00:55:26,291
let it be.

1239
00:55:26,292 --> 00:55:28,795
'Cause that's the way
the people relate today.

1240
00:55:28,796 --> 00:55:30,476
They don't, they don't
talk about anything.

1241
00:55:30,477 --> 00:55:31,597
They just reference things.

1242
00:55:31,598 --> 00:55:32,764
Thank, thank you.

1243
00:55:32,765 --> 00:55:34,066
Oh yeah, I had a great weekend.

1244
00:55:34,067 --> 00:55:35,034
I went to this wedding.

1245
00:55:35,035 --> 00:55:36,795
You know actually, it
was a lot like "wedding

1246
00:55:36,796 --> 00:55:39,072
crashers," but
meets "memento."

1247
00:55:39,073 --> 00:55:40,872
That sounds like a good weekend

1248
00:55:40,873 --> 00:55:42,633
yeah, it probably does sound
cool. Who knows?

1249
00:55:42,634 --> 00:55:44,068
Or like, I don't know
how I was feeling, it was

1250
00:55:44,069 --> 00:55:46,311
probably, probably how
Rachel felt when Ross was

1251
00:55:46,312 --> 00:55:48,014
marrying that British girl.

1252
00:55:48,015 --> 00:55:49,148
Well, time out.

1253
00:55:49,149 --> 00:55:51,349
I'm pretty sure you just
admitted to watching "friends."

1254
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:53,086
Yes. You did. He did.

1255
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:55,822
There are Libyan refugees
who've seen "friends."

1256
00:55:55,823 --> 00:55:59,158
Oh, I have never felt this
stoned in my whole life.

1257
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:01,728
Wow, okay.

1258
00:56:01,729 --> 00:56:05,063
It's hot. It's hot. It's hot.

1259
00:56:05,064 --> 00:56:06,666
It's hot in here.

1260
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:08,066
It's pot.

1261
00:56:08,067 --> 00:56:09,267
It's pot?

1262
00:56:09,268 --> 00:56:10,903
Oh, that's a funny joke.

1263
00:56:10,904 --> 00:56:13,106
Well,

1264
00:56:13,107 --> 00:56:13,872
whoa!

1265
00:56:13,873 --> 00:56:15,108
Whoa, okay.

1266
00:56:15,109 --> 00:56:16,949
Okay, that's a fun game
we're not going to play

1267
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:17,744
right now.

1268
00:56:17,745 --> 00:56:19,112
Is this a joke?

1269
00:56:19,113 --> 00:56:20,413
Are you my dad?

1270
00:56:26,085 --> 00:56:27,253
Oh, that's me, sorry.

1271
00:56:27,254 --> 00:56:28,894
Are you sure you want
to answer right now?

1272
00:56:28,895 --> 00:56:30,923
<i>Maybe don't answer right now.</i>

1273
00:56:30,924 --> 00:56:32,090
And she answers it.

1274
00:56:32,091 --> 00:56:34,193
Uh huh?

1275
00:56:34,194 --> 00:56:36,128
Tonight?

1276
00:56:36,129 --> 00:56:37,430
Yeah, it's okay if..

1277
00:56:37,431 --> 00:56:38,398
Could be important.

1278
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,999
No, of course I'm okay.

1279
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:40,433
Okay.

1280
00:56:40,434 --> 00:56:41,401
Okay.

1281
00:56:41,402 --> 00:56:44,205
Bye.

1282
00:56:46,205 --> 00:56:47,439
Oh my God.

1283
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,307
<i>Hmm?</i>

1284
00:56:48,308 --> 00:56:51,144
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

1285
00:56:51,145 --> 00:56:53,179
Oh my God oh my God oh my God
oh my God oh my God oh my God.

1286
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:53,647
What is it?

1287
00:56:53,648 --> 00:56:54,313
Are you alright?

1288
00:56:54,314 --> 00:56:55,447
I'm so screwed.

1289
00:56:55,448 --> 00:56:57,608
They just asked me to cover
the crisis hotline tonight.

1290
00:56:57,609 --> 00:56:58,284
Now?

1291
00:56:58,285 --> 00:56:59,251
Yeah.

1292
00:56:59,252 --> 00:57:00,318
Wow.

1293
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:01,319
Can you say no?

1294
00:57:02,221 --> 00:57:03,389
I can't breathe.

1295
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:05,324
No, I think you're
going to do a great job.

1296
00:57:05,325 --> 00:57:07,726
<i>I agree, she is going
to knock 'em dead.</i>

1297
00:57:07,727 --> 00:57:08,607
<i>Hey! That's not funny.</i>

1298
00:57:08,608 --> 00:57:09,695
I can't breathe.

1299
00:57:09,696 --> 00:57:10,996
That's a little funny.

1300
00:57:10,997 --> 00:57:11,530
No it's going to be okay.

1301
00:57:11,531 --> 00:57:12,411
It's going to be fine.

1302
00:57:12,412 --> 00:57:13,965
No, it's not okay.

1303
00:57:13,966 --> 00:57:19,805
No it's not okay, it's
not okay, it's not okay!

1304
00:57:19,806 --> 00:57:21,173
Okay, hang on for a bit.

1305
00:57:21,174 --> 00:57:22,842
Isaac, this is a big deal.

1306
00:57:22,843 --> 00:57:23,876
People are going to die.

1307
00:57:23,877 --> 00:57:25,343
They're not going to die.

1308
00:57:25,344 --> 00:57:26,945
Hey, hey, Kate?

1309
00:57:26,946 --> 00:57:28,914
So, I have some
Xanax in my purse.

1310
00:57:28,915 --> 00:57:30,083
I'm going to go get it, okay?

1311
00:57:30,084 --> 00:57:31,117
I have Klonopin right here.

1312
00:57:31,118 --> 00:57:31,851
I've got one in my pocket.

1313
00:57:31,852 --> 00:57:33,132
Yeah, but Xanax kicks in faster.

1314
00:57:33,133 --> 00:57:34,186
Klonopin lasts longer.

1315
00:57:34,187 --> 00:57:36,088
Which one do you prefer, Timmy?

1316
00:57:36,089 --> 00:57:37,322
Timmy likes Klonopin.

1317
00:57:37,323 --> 00:57:38,891
Well Xanax gives me a headache!

1318
00:57:38,892 --> 00:57:40,026
It's going to be fine.

1319
00:57:40,027 --> 00:57:41,347
It's... you're going to be
talking

1320
00:57:41,348 --> 00:57:42,588
just like you're talking to me.

1321
00:57:42,589 --> 00:57:44,096
<i>But Klonopin has a little more
bite!</i>

1322
00:57:44,097 --> 00:57:48,133
Okay, so there you go,
and now you have the best

1323
00:57:48,134 --> 00:57:51,037
anti-anxiety medicine
money can buy.

1324
00:57:51,038 --> 00:57:53,171
That's debatable.

1325
00:57:53,172 --> 00:57:53,892
Not helping. Stop.

1326
00:57:53,893 --> 00:57:55,807
There we go. Let's get Upsies.

1327
00:57:55,808 --> 00:57:56,508
Ohoho.

1328
00:57:56,509 --> 00:57:57,443
<i>Ohh, alright!</i>

1329
00:57:57,444 --> 00:57:58,878
Hey!

1330
00:57:58,879 --> 00:57:59,912
<i>She's up!</i>

1331
00:57:59,913 --> 00:58:01,180
Okay.

1332
00:58:01,181 --> 00:58:02,481
Josh.

1333
00:58:02,482 --> 00:58:02,983
What?

1334
00:58:03,183 --> 00:58:04,816
When did you start taking meds?

1335
00:58:04,817 --> 00:58:05,751
What?

1336
00:58:05,752 --> 00:58:06,753
Prescription drugs.

1337
00:58:06,754 --> 00:58:08,086
When did you start taking them?

1338
00:58:08,087 --> 00:58:09,155
The Klonopin thing?

1339
00:58:09,156 --> 00:58:09,856
Yeah.

1340
00:58:09,857 --> 00:58:11,057
I don't want to talk about it.

1341
00:58:11,058 --> 00:58:12,124
Why?

1342
00:58:12,125 --> 00:58:14,327
Because I don't want
to talk about it.

1343
00:58:14,328 --> 00:58:16,929
I'm just curious.

1344
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:18,331
I'm not judging.

1345
00:58:18,332 --> 00:58:20,499
I went to a therapist
once, and I don't go

1346
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,434
anymore.

1347
00:58:21,435 --> 00:58:22,769
And they gave me that.

1348
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:23,737
Just once?

1349
00:58:23,738 --> 00:58:25,578
I started going when I
realized I was writing a

1350
00:58:25,579 --> 00:58:28,039
dissertation that probably
no one in their right mind

1351
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:31,181
is ever going to read.

1352
00:58:34,181 --> 00:58:35,414
Let's play a game.

1353
00:58:35,415 --> 00:58:36,016
<i>Yeah.</i>

1354
00:58:36,216 --> 00:58:37,983
<i>Yeah!</i>

1355
00:58:37,984 --> 00:58:42,454
Alright, I actually have a game.

1356
00:58:42,455 --> 00:58:44,157
Ready? Get out of there.

1357
00:58:44,158 --> 00:58:45,925
<i>What are the rules, then?</i>

1358
00:58:45,926 --> 00:58:47,827
Okay.

1359
00:58:47,828 --> 00:58:48,795
Good question.

1360
00:58:48,796 --> 00:58:52,130
The rules are that there
are no rules until you

1361
00:58:52,131 --> 00:58:54,535
write them on a card.

1362
00:58:55,535 --> 00:58:57,235
Okay, are we in?

1363
00:58:57,236 --> 00:58:58,156
<i>Yeah, let's do it okay.</i>

1364
00:58:58,157 --> 00:59:00,197
I'll go first.

1365
00:59:05,078 --> 00:59:06,077
Okay.

1366
00:59:06,078 --> 00:59:07,979
Everyone one must pat
their heads and rub their

1367
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:10,583
bellies before playing a
card, or they have to take

1368
00:59:10,584 --> 00:59:11,584
a drink.

1369
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:12,990
What are we doing?

1370
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,988
Playing an imbecilic game.

1371
00:59:15,989 --> 00:59:17,088
Sounds good, I'm in.

1372
00:59:17,089 --> 00:59:18,259
Woo hoo!

1373
00:59:19,259 --> 00:59:20,293
Okay.

1374
00:59:20,294 --> 00:59:23,262
Okay, that's great, but
you have to rub your belly

1375
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,503
and pat your head before you...

1376
00:59:24,504 --> 00:59:26,331
Can we stop saying belly?
It's...

1377
00:59:26,332 --> 00:59:27,400
Belly. Rub it.

1378
00:59:27,401 --> 00:59:30,570
Before you speak, you must
turn to the person on your

1379
00:59:30,571 --> 00:59:32,938
left, introduce
yourself, then hug.

1380
00:59:32,939 --> 00:59:34,840
Are you fucking kidding me?

1381
00:59:34,841 --> 00:59:35,575
Come on big guy.

1382
00:59:35,576 --> 00:59:36,510
Let's do this.

1383
00:59:36,511 --> 00:59:38,443
Absolute... get the fuck,
get away from me.

1384
00:59:38,444 --> 00:59:39,644
You didn't introduce yourself.

1385
00:59:39,645 --> 00:59:40,565
You just read the card.

1386
00:59:40,566 --> 00:59:42,380
You didn't introduce yourself.

1387
00:59:42,381 --> 00:59:43,821
You didn't introduce
yourself either.

1388
00:59:43,822 --> 00:59:44,822
That's fair, okay.

1389
00:59:45,218 --> 00:59:46,985
Hello, my name is Sarah.

1390
00:59:46,986 --> 00:59:48,887
It's really nice to meet
you, and now we are...

1391
00:59:48,888 --> 00:59:49,921
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

1392
00:59:49,922 --> 00:59:51,122
Hi, I'm Josh.

1393
00:59:51,123 --> 00:59:54,428
This game is slowly
making me stupider.

1394
00:59:55,428 --> 00:59:57,195
Okay, I'll do it.

1395
00:59:57,196 --> 00:59:57,631
No, I got you.

1396
00:59:57,632 --> 01:00:01,468
Hold on.

1397
01:00:02,068 --> 01:00:02,268
Okay, first off, I have to..

1398
01:00:02,468 --> 01:00:03,468
Yeah.

1399
01:00:04,835 --> 01:00:05,678
Hi, how are you.

1400
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:12,478
Hello.

1401
01:00:12,479 --> 01:00:13,613
Really?

1402
01:00:13,614 --> 01:00:14,734
Yeah. It's part of the game.

1403
01:00:14,735 --> 01:00:18,210
Why don't you read it?

1404
01:00:22,022 --> 01:00:26,925
Um, suicide.

1405
01:00:26,926 --> 01:00:30,662
Everyone take a turn and
explain what it means to you.

1406
01:00:30,663 --> 01:00:31,597
Good job, man.

1407
01:00:31,598 --> 01:00:34,076
Thank you.

1408
01:00:43,076 --> 01:00:46,612
Uh, this card makes all of
Josh's rules invalid and

1409
01:00:46,613 --> 01:00:48,046
can be played at any time.

1410
01:00:48,047 --> 01:00:49,048
You can't do that.

1411
01:00:49,049 --> 01:00:50,049
Just did.

1412
01:00:50,216 --> 01:00:51,249
Sorry, the card says you
can play the card at any time.

1413
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:53,351
It goes against the
underlying architecture of

1414
01:00:53,352 --> 01:00:56,155
the game of laying
cards and taking turns.

1415
01:00:56,156 --> 01:00:58,590
For being all strict about it,
you didn't introduce yourself.

1416
01:00:58,591 --> 01:01:00,626
Neither the fuck did you!

1417
01:01:00,627 --> 01:01:01,526
Okay, Josh.

1418
01:01:01,527 --> 01:01:03,162
Let's, uh, let's do that.

1419
01:01:03,163 --> 01:01:04,664
But you, you start.

1420
01:01:04,665 --> 01:01:05,497
Let's not.

1421
01:01:05,498 --> 01:01:08,467
No no, let's do it.

1422
01:01:08,468 --> 01:01:10,603
Okay.

1423
01:01:10,604 --> 01:01:11,970
Yeah.

1424
01:01:11,971 --> 01:01:14,639
I get sadness, okay?

1425
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,575
I certainly get anxiety.

1426
01:01:16,576 --> 01:01:17,675
I get depression.

1427
01:01:17,676 --> 01:01:20,278
I'm pretty sure that I'm
experiencing one of those

1428
01:01:20,279 --> 01:01:23,682
things at all times, but
what I don't understand

1429
01:01:23,683 --> 01:01:25,985
is, Alex, is suicide,
because never once have I

1430
01:01:25,986 --> 01:01:29,354
not been absolutely
terrified of my own death,

1431
01:01:29,355 --> 01:01:32,191
and what that might do
to everyone around me.

1432
01:01:32,192 --> 01:01:33,025
<i>I'm done.</i>

1433
01:01:33,026 --> 01:01:34,546
I don't want to play
this game anymore.

1434
01:01:34,547 --> 01:01:36,095
No, I think this is
a really good game.

1435
01:01:36,096 --> 01:01:38,264
We've been dancing around
the main point of this

1436
01:01:38,265 --> 01:01:40,700
trip all weekend.

1437
01:01:40,701 --> 01:01:43,135
I mean Jesus Christ.

1438
01:01:43,136 --> 01:01:45,503
Nobody would even talk
about the downstairs

1439
01:01:45,504 --> 01:01:47,273
bathroom, let alone walk
in there.

1440
01:01:47,274 --> 01:01:48,474
Alex, I've been in there.

1441
01:01:48,475 --> 01:01:49,976
It's a fucking mess.

1442
01:01:49,977 --> 01:01:51,443
So let's open that door.

1443
01:01:51,444 --> 01:01:53,979
Literally, metaphorically,
pardon the pun.

1444
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:55,146
Josh, stop.

1445
01:01:55,147 --> 01:01:57,450
Sarah, please shut up.

1446
01:01:57,451 --> 01:01:59,517
I think Alex should,
should give it to us

1447
01:01:59,518 --> 01:02:00,720
straight here.

1448
01:02:00,721 --> 01:02:01,820
You know?

1449
01:02:01,821 --> 01:02:04,657
Tell us all what a good
job we all did of fucking

1450
01:02:04,658 --> 01:02:06,392
him up when he was down.

1451
01:02:06,393 --> 01:02:09,061
How we all noticed his
increasingly erratic

1452
01:02:09,062 --> 01:02:12,030
tweets and status updates,
and how we all thought

1453
01:02:12,031 --> 01:02:13,716
enough to do something about it.

1454
01:02:14,201 --> 01:02:14,701
Alright.

1455
01:02:14,768 --> 01:02:15,735
Sarah...

1456
01:02:15,736 --> 01:02:17,702
Let her go, she'll be fine.

1457
01:02:17,703 --> 01:02:19,338
You're a piece of
shit, you know that?

1458
01:02:19,339 --> 01:02:20,773
I'm a truth teller.

1459
01:02:20,774 --> 01:02:23,742
Alex has been saying some,
no offense, you've been

1460
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:25,410
saying some weird
stuff for a while.

1461
01:02:25,411 --> 01:02:29,115
And you can't
blame us for not...

1462
01:02:29,116 --> 01:02:31,076
Being able to see that
there was a bigger problem.

1463
01:02:31,077 --> 01:02:32,418
Some weird stuff?

1464
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:34,285
I'm sorry, what was it
exactly Alex, that it...

1465
01:02:34,286 --> 01:02:35,487
Does anybody remember?

1466
01:02:35,488 --> 01:02:40,092
"Ask for me tomorrow and
you shall find me a grave man?"

1467
01:02:40,093 --> 01:02:42,360
Lot of ambiguity in that one.

1468
01:02:42,361 --> 01:02:43,461
Where the fuck were you?

1469
01:02:43,462 --> 01:02:44,102
That's my point?

1470
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:45,697
Where the fuck were any of us?

1471
01:02:45,698 --> 01:02:51,406
Okay, okay, um...

1472
01:02:52,406 --> 01:02:54,773
Alex called me a lot that day.

1473
01:02:54,774 --> 01:02:59,644
He called me a lot
that week, and uh...

1474
01:02:59,645 --> 01:03:02,514
And I didn't answer.

1475
01:03:02,515 --> 01:03:09,789
I didn't answer even though I
knew he wasn't doing well.

1476
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:14,726
The truth is, none of this
would've happened if I

1477
01:03:14,727 --> 01:03:19,298
would've been a better
friend to my friend.

1478
01:03:19,299 --> 01:03:20,231
No...

1479
01:03:20,232 --> 01:03:22,233
So, this one's on me.

1480
01:03:22,234 --> 01:03:23,550
No it's not, Ben, please.

1481
01:03:24,203 --> 01:03:28,340
No. It's not, I mean, I...

1482
01:03:28,341 --> 01:03:32,144
Yeah, I, I was upset that
you were not answering my

1483
01:03:32,145 --> 01:03:37,115
calls, but I...

1484
01:03:37,116 --> 01:03:42,755
I didn't want to die.

1485
01:03:42,756 --> 01:03:45,657
What?

1486
01:03:45,658 --> 01:03:48,461
Well, I, know, I mean, I...

1487
01:03:48,462 --> 01:03:51,563
I thought I, I
thought I did. I did. I...

1488
01:03:51,564 --> 01:03:53,499
If you didn't want
to die then, w...

1489
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,468
I did, but then I, I
changed my mind, and I

1490
01:03:56,469 --> 01:04:00,271
called the hospital
myself, and... you know,

1491
01:04:00,272 --> 01:04:03,541
I, I think...

1492
01:04:03,542 --> 01:04:08,216
I, I really think that I
just wanted to, you know,

1493
01:04:09,216 --> 01:04:11,819
to see you, and...

1494
01:04:13,819 --> 01:04:15,488
You wanted to see me?

1495
01:04:15,489 --> 01:04:17,755
Well yeah, I mean, no,
but, you, and everyone.

1496
01:04:17,756 --> 01:04:18,724
Right right, everyone.

1497
01:04:18,725 --> 01:04:19,724
Right.

1498
01:04:19,725 --> 01:04:21,459
You wanted to see
everyone, so you slit your

1499
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:24,863
wrists, but not enough so
you would die, but..

1500
01:04:24,864 --> 01:04:27,266
I'm not saying that it makes
sense, I'm...

1501
01:04:27,267 --> 01:04:29,501
You're right, it makes
absolutely no sense, Alex.

1502
01:04:29,502 --> 01:04:31,403
It makes no fucking sense.

1503
01:04:31,404 --> 01:04:35,141
Do you have any idea what
I've been going through?

1504
01:04:35,142 --> 01:04:36,542
What I've been
thinking and feeling?

1505
01:04:36,543 --> 01:04:37,809
- Yes, yes I do. I do.
- You do?

1506
01:04:37,810 --> 01:04:38,970
- Please tell me-
- I'm sorry.

1507
01:04:38,971 --> 01:04:39,811
Oh you're sorry?

1508
01:04:39,812 --> 01:04:41,313
I was trying to get
in touch with you.

1509
01:04:41,314 --> 01:04:41,994
I have a job man!

1510
01:04:42,181 --> 01:04:43,314
Fucking duties!

1511
01:04:43,315 --> 01:04:44,249
I have a fucking deadline!

1512
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:45,284
Oh yeah, you were so busy?

1513
01:04:45,285 --> 01:04:46,418
I have a fucking job! Yes I was
fucking busy!

1514
01:04:46,419 --> 01:04:48,499
When you were writing your
book that you haven't been

1515
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,155
writing for a year?

1516
01:04:50,156 --> 01:04:51,916
Is that what you were
doing that you couldn't

1517
01:04:51,917 --> 01:04:54,267
answer the phone one time?

1518
01:05:07,841 --> 01:05:09,216
Ben...

1519
01:05:16,216 --> 01:05:18,184
Hey.

1520
01:05:18,185 --> 01:05:19,185
Hey, Sarah, come here.

1521
01:05:19,218 --> 01:05:20,853
What?

1522
01:05:20,854 --> 01:05:21,820
Look at me.

1523
01:05:21,821 --> 01:05:23,255
Look at me.

1524
01:05:23,256 --> 01:05:24,956
Sarah...

1525
01:05:24,957 --> 01:05:28,526
I'm sorry, okay?

1526
01:05:28,527 --> 01:05:31,496
Sometimes things,
they need to be said.

1527
01:05:31,497 --> 01:05:38,906
And in those instances,
being an asshole comes in handy.

1528
01:05:39,906 --> 01:05:44,946
You okay?

1529
01:05:45,946 --> 01:05:47,246
Stop.

1530
01:05:47,247 --> 01:05:49,881
What?

1531
01:05:49,882 --> 01:05:51,650
Josh, stop.

1532
01:05:51,651 --> 01:05:54,420
Seriously.

1533
01:05:54,421 --> 01:05:56,488
Come on.

1534
01:05:56,489 --> 01:05:58,324
All that talk about death?

1535
01:05:58,325 --> 01:06:00,492
Eugh.

1536
01:06:00,493 --> 01:06:04,998
Tell me you don't want to.

1537
01:06:05,998 --> 01:06:07,666
No, stop.

1538
01:06:07,667 --> 01:06:09,568
What?

1539
01:06:09,569 --> 01:06:10,735
You know what I want?

1540
01:06:10,736 --> 01:06:14,907
I want you to have acted
like my boyfriend 7 years ago.

1541
01:06:14,908 --> 01:06:18,510
Taken me to a movie, bought
me a fucking ice cream cone.

1542
01:06:18,511 --> 01:06:20,378
That's what I want.

1543
01:06:20,379 --> 01:06:22,947
Instead of being the guy
who permanently fucked up

1544
01:06:22,948 --> 01:06:26,452
my expectations
for normalcy in a relationship.

1545
01:06:26,453 --> 01:06:28,820
The guy that made me
explain to my mom that

1546
01:06:28,821 --> 01:06:31,724
"no, Josh isn't exactly
my boyfriend, he is just

1547
01:06:31,725 --> 01:06:34,892
someone who sleeps with me
when he comes home pining

1548
01:06:34,893 --> 01:06:37,899
for my best friend, too
drunk to see straight."

1549
01:06:39,899 --> 01:06:41,867
Sarah, I was 20.

1550
01:06:41,868 --> 01:06:44,637
So was I.

1551
01:06:44,638 --> 01:06:45,771
I...

1552
01:06:45,772 --> 01:06:48,974
My dad had just left my mom.

1553
01:06:48,975 --> 01:06:50,709
Is that your excuse?

1554
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:52,744
I was angry.

1555
01:06:52,745 --> 01:06:54,412
Okay?

1556
01:06:54,413 --> 01:06:55,514
I was angry.

1557
01:06:55,515 --> 01:07:01,725
I was angry at my dad, I
was angry at fucking Ben.

1558
01:07:05,725 --> 01:07:11,350
What, you didn't even see
what you were doing to me?

1559
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:31,988
One minute.

1560
01:07:46,665 --> 01:07:48,599
<i>What's your name?</i>

1561
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,436
<i>Amber?</i>

1562
01:07:50,437 --> 01:07:52,671
<i>Wow, that's a pretty name.</i>

1563
01:07:52,672 --> 01:07:56,909
<i>How old are you?</i>

1564
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:58,543
What's up?

1565
01:07:58,544 --> 01:08:04,016
What's going on?

1566
01:08:04,017 --> 01:08:07,452
Man, I'm sorry about that Amber.

1567
01:08:07,453 --> 01:08:12,490
That's tough to feel like
you've finally found that

1568
01:08:12,491 --> 01:08:16,829
person, the right
person for you and...

1569
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:18,901
They don't feel the same.

1570
01:08:21,901 --> 01:08:23,402
Mm.

1571
01:08:23,403 --> 01:08:25,838
Hey, Amber, Amber, Amber.

1572
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:30,509
Most people I know, most
people in the world,

1573
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:34,112
they're actually really afraid
to feel what you're feeling.

1574
01:08:34,113 --> 01:08:36,749
They won't even let themselves.

1575
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:39,585
But you, you're...

1576
01:08:39,586 --> 01:08:42,086
You're willing to go there.

1577
01:08:42,087 --> 01:08:48,927
And to me, that means
that you're very brave.

1578
01:08:48,928 --> 01:08:50,728
And...

1579
01:08:50,729 --> 01:08:55,715
To me that means that you
are going to be just fine.

1580
01:09:09,715 --> 01:09:12,918
Hey.

1581
01:09:12,919 --> 01:09:13,919
<i>Hi.</i>

1582
01:09:16,589 --> 01:09:17,589
Hi.

1583
01:09:20,426 --> 01:09:23,528
Will you pinch me again?

1584
01:09:23,529 --> 01:09:26,598
What?

1585
01:09:26,599 --> 01:09:33,504
On why you want to try?

1586
01:09:33,505 --> 01:09:36,107
I want to.

1587
01:09:36,108 --> 01:09:37,215
I'm ready.

1588
01:09:43,215 --> 01:09:46,220
I know.

1589
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:51,089
Tell me more.

1590
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:54,793
I just need reasons.

1591
01:09:54,794 --> 01:09:57,595
Why?

1592
01:09:57,596 --> 01:10:02,835
Because it turns
out that I'm not.

1593
01:10:02,836 --> 01:10:06,671
It turns out it
was a false alarm.

1594
01:10:06,672 --> 01:10:09,540
I guess I was just worried
that maybe you got caught up in

1595
01:10:09,541 --> 01:10:11,381
the moment and said some
things that you didn't

1596
01:10:11,581 --> 01:10:13,501
really mean, and maybe
someday you'd regret them,

1597
01:10:13,502 --> 01:10:14,879
so...

1598
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,785
I just...

1599
01:10:18,785 --> 01:10:21,253
Ben...

1600
01:10:21,254 --> 01:10:23,688
Please say something.

1601
01:10:23,689 --> 01:10:26,926
I don't, I don't know.

1602
01:10:27,926 --> 01:10:32,134
It's not like I was
lying back there.

1603
01:10:35,134 --> 01:10:37,068
Um, maybe you're right.

1604
01:10:37,069 --> 01:10:39,279
Maybe...

1605
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:48,279
What?

1606
01:10:50,215 --> 01:10:53,184
Really?

1607
01:10:53,185 --> 01:10:57,188
I push you that
much and you fold?

1608
01:10:57,189 --> 01:10:58,189
You're not even fighting me.

1609
01:10:58,190 --> 01:10:59,230
I don't know what it is...

1610
01:10:59,231 --> 01:11:00,671
Come on please,
don't, don't do that.

1611
01:11:00,672 --> 01:11:02,760
You always pretend like
you're the one that's all

1612
01:11:02,761 --> 01:11:05,296
in, when you know like I
know if I was writing, if

1613
01:11:05,297 --> 01:11:08,066
I was on, we wouldn't even
be having this conversation.

1614
01:11:08,067 --> 01:11:09,547
You wouldn't even
be opting out of our

1615
01:11:09,548 --> 01:11:12,271
relationship and flying
across the country to LA...

1616
01:11:12,272 --> 01:11:14,071
- Wherever the
- can you even hear yourself?

1617
01:11:14,072 --> 01:11:15,840
This wouldn't
be happening. You know...

1618
01:11:15,841 --> 01:11:18,210
Do you really think
that's what this is about?

1619
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:20,044
This is not about you.

1620
01:11:20,045 --> 01:11:21,847
This has nothing to
do with your writing.

1621
01:11:21,848 --> 01:11:23,488
This has everything
to do with my writing.

1622
01:11:23,489 --> 01:11:26,466
It's always had everything
to do with my writing.

1623
01:11:49,142 --> 01:11:50,843
Busted.

1624
01:11:54,647 --> 01:11:56,915
That was a dramatic night.

1625
01:11:56,916 --> 01:11:59,084
Yeah.

1626
01:11:59,085 --> 01:12:00,619
I was serious about
dinner, by the way.

1627
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:01,719
It was so good.

1628
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,589
Oh, thank you.

1629
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:04,389
Shut up.

1630
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:06,592
You should open
your own restaurant.

1631
01:12:06,593 --> 01:12:09,327
Yeah, can you imagine that
conversation with my parents?

1632
01:12:09,328 --> 01:12:13,264
Fuck it. Do it anyway.

1633
01:12:13,265 --> 01:12:18,037
So what, you just give
up on what you want?

1634
01:12:19,037 --> 01:12:20,879
Who says that's what I want?

1635
01:12:28,781 --> 01:12:32,049
Okay, it's what I want.

1636
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:32,985
You happy?

1637
01:12:32,986 --> 01:12:34,991
Yeah, I totally am.

1638
01:12:37,991 --> 01:12:39,357
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1639
01:12:39,358 --> 01:12:40,925
I'm sorry.

1640
01:12:40,926 --> 01:12:42,126
No no, it's okay.

1641
01:12:42,127 --> 01:12:44,896
I'm sorry.

1642
01:12:44,897 --> 01:12:47,064
Hey, don't take that
personally, okay?

1643
01:12:47,065 --> 01:12:49,101
- It's kind okay.
- Of like...

1644
01:12:49,102 --> 01:12:51,103
A new policy of
mine, apparently.

1645
01:12:51,104 --> 01:12:52,104
What's that mean?

1646
01:12:52,205 --> 01:12:54,673
Um, I just did the
same thing to Josh.

1647
01:12:54,674 --> 01:12:55,906
Oh, great.

1648
01:12:55,907 --> 01:12:57,778
Great.

1649
01:12:58,778 --> 01:12:59,878
Isaac, I'm, come on.

1650
01:12:59,879 --> 01:13:02,181
I didn't mean it like that.

1651
01:13:03,181 --> 01:13:04,049
I'm sorry.

1652
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:04,930
That was embarrassing.

1653
01:13:04,931 --> 01:13:06,299
I thought that's
what you wanted.

1654
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:07,853
No, I did.

1655
01:13:07,854 --> 01:13:09,086
I do, believe me.

1656
01:13:09,087 --> 01:13:10,155
Apparently not anymore.

1657
01:13:10,156 --> 01:13:12,156
Well, for a long
time I did want that.

1658
01:13:12,157 --> 01:13:13,227
Okay.

1659
01:13:14,227 --> 01:13:15,227
But...

1660
01:13:16,328 --> 01:13:17,328
But...

1661
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:20,667
But that's, it's
not what you want.

1662
01:13:21,325 --> 01:13:22,747
You don't know what I want.

1663
01:13:22,748 --> 01:13:24,268
I-Isaac, you
don't want this.

1664
01:13:24,269 --> 01:13:27,408
Your 19 year-old
self wants this.

1665
01:13:29,408 --> 01:13:31,108
You want closure.

1666
01:13:31,109 --> 01:13:35,013
You want...

1667
01:13:35,014 --> 01:13:41,719
I think you're afraid that this
thing with Kate might be real,

1668
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,823
you think it could be real.

1669
01:13:44,823 --> 01:13:46,232
Sarah...

1670
01:13:53,232 --> 01:13:54,465
How did it go?

1671
01:13:54,466 --> 01:13:56,735
I don't think I have
any blood on my hands.

1672
01:13:56,736 --> 01:13:57,702
That's great.

1673
01:13:57,703 --> 01:13:58,703
That's good.

1674
01:14:08,246 --> 01:14:09,246
Hey.

1675
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:11,795
Hey.

1676
01:14:23,795 --> 01:14:26,430
You've been quiet all weekend.

1677
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:31,068
Everyone likes talking
more than listening.

1678
01:14:31,069 --> 01:14:32,937
Sometimes I just
get tired of it.

1679
01:14:32,938 --> 01:14:34,839
I prefer the opposite.

1680
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:38,242
Well, if that, that is not
a rare quality, I don't

1681
01:14:38,243 --> 01:14:39,348
know what is.

1682
01:14:42,348 --> 01:14:44,750
Ben didn't mean it.

1683
01:14:44,751 --> 01:14:48,786
What he said to you.

1684
01:14:48,787 --> 01:14:50,821
It's okay, I, I...

1685
01:14:50,822 --> 01:14:53,959
No it's not.

1686
01:14:53,960 --> 01:15:00,064
It's not okay, what they did.

1687
01:15:00,065 --> 01:15:02,546
It's not okay what I did either.

1688
01:15:14,546 --> 01:15:18,383
Can I see?

1689
01:15:18,384 --> 01:15:21,919
Why?

1690
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,421
I don't know.

1691
01:15:24,422 --> 01:15:26,058
Okay.

1692
01:15:59,058 --> 01:16:05,886
You know we both
have to let it go.

1693
01:16:27,886 --> 01:16:29,223
Where you been?

1694
01:16:30,223 --> 01:16:35,629
Oh, attempting to
have sex with Sarah.

1695
01:16:36,629 --> 01:16:38,530
Good for her for
turning you down.

1696
01:16:38,531 --> 01:16:43,142
Heh, thank you.

1697
01:16:50,142 --> 01:16:53,544
You know, I can't remember
what happened last.

1698
01:16:53,545 --> 01:16:58,456
Me writing something good
or me and Siri having sex.

1699
01:17:03,056 --> 01:17:05,423
So basically what you're
saying is that you're

1700
01:17:05,424 --> 01:17:08,660
blocked in more ways than one.

1701
01:17:08,661 --> 01:17:11,466
Yeah, that's one way to put it.

1702
01:17:14,466 --> 01:17:19,271
To think that I've been
jealous of you for 7 years.

1703
01:17:19,272 --> 01:17:21,510
Hm.

1704
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:27,178
Looks like someone
made a friend.

1705
01:17:27,179 --> 01:17:32,153
He's the only one
that understands me.

1706
01:17:34,153 --> 01:17:35,954
What happened to everyone?

1707
01:17:35,955 --> 01:17:37,621
Isaac and Kate went to bed.

1708
01:17:37,622 --> 01:17:41,492
I guess Siri did too.

1709
01:17:41,493 --> 01:17:43,260
And what about Alex.

1710
01:17:43,261 --> 01:17:47,710
I thought he was with you.

1711
01:17:57,710 --> 01:18:00,178
<i>Ben, wait wait wait.</i>

1712
01:18:00,179 --> 01:18:03,080
<i>Ben...</i>

1713
01:18:03,081 --> 01:18:04,584
Hey, did you find him?

1714
01:18:05,584 --> 01:18:07,384
Ben.

1715
01:18:07,385 --> 01:18:09,053
Ben!

1716
01:18:09,054 --> 01:18:10,287
What's going on?

1717
01:18:10,288 --> 01:18:12,357
Wait, wait, wait,
Ben, Ben, Ben Ben.

1718
01:18:12,358 --> 01:18:13,458
Please, please, please.

1719
01:18:13,459 --> 01:18:14,358
Just let me...

1720
01:18:14,359 --> 01:18:15,999
What can you possibly
say to me right now?

1721
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,461
That I, I love you.

1722
01:18:17,462 --> 01:18:18,495
I really I do, more than
anyone in the world.

1723
01:18:18,496 --> 01:18:19,563
Fuck you!

1724
01:18:19,564 --> 01:18:21,398
Please-oh!

1725
01:18:21,399 --> 01:18:22,742
Ow!

1726
01:18:29,742 --> 01:18:31,076
Wait, Ben Ben Ben.

1727
01:18:31,077 --> 01:18:35,312
Ben, please, please,
I'm sorry, okay, no!

1728
01:18:35,313 --> 01:18:36,313
Ben!

1729
01:18:36,314 --> 01:18:39,152
Ben!

1730
01:18:40,152 --> 01:18:42,286
Where are your keys!

1731
01:18:42,287 --> 01:18:44,656
Sarah, where are your keys?

1732
01:18:44,657 --> 01:18:48,759
I gave them to Ben.

1733
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:49,560
<i>The fuck's going on?</i>

1734
01:18:49,561 --> 01:18:50,629
<i>I don't know.</i>

1735
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:52,997
<i>I don't know. Everybody's
getting together with everybody.</i>

1736
01:18:52,998 --> 01:18:57,634
♪ I heard it was
a real good time ♪

1737
01:18:57,635 --> 01:18:59,036
♪ I heard it was... ♪

1738
01:18:59,037 --> 01:19:00,572
Fuck!

1739
01:19:09,581 --> 01:19:11,349
Shit!

1740
01:20:46,879 --> 01:20:51,683
<i>Judgment has a way of creeping
into every relationship.</i>

1741
01:20:51,684 --> 01:20:55,687
<i>Even the most intimate.</i>

1742
01:20:55,688 --> 01:20:57,608
<i>If we're lucky, somewhere
along the way we meet a</i>

1743
01:20:57,609 --> 01:21:07,232
<i>few people who listen to us
without criticism or reproach.</i>

1744
01:21:07,233 --> 01:21:09,602
<i>We call those
people our friends.</i>

1745
01:22:09,795 --> 01:22:12,897
Nice shiner.

1746
01:22:12,898 --> 01:22:16,800
Nice driving.

1747
01:22:16,801 --> 01:22:18,937
What are you doing?

1748
01:22:18,938 --> 01:22:20,215
Writing.

1749
01:22:29,215 --> 01:22:37,621
Um, I'm uh, I'm a
little fucked up.

1750
01:22:37,622 --> 01:22:40,758
No shit?

1751
01:22:40,759 --> 01:22:45,662
Can I play that card now?

1752
01:22:45,663 --> 01:22:48,305
Sure.

1753
01:22:54,305 --> 01:23:00,844
I um...

1754
01:23:00,845 --> 01:23:05,983
I know that uh...

1755
01:23:05,984 --> 01:23:06,951
That it's UN...

1756
01:23:06,952 --> 01:23:11,255
Unhealthy to...

1757
01:23:11,256 --> 01:23:14,625
To need, um...

1758
01:23:14,626 --> 01:23:18,295
T-just too much from
people, and I've been

1759
01:23:18,296 --> 01:23:21,598
working really hard on...

1760
01:23:21,599 --> 01:23:24,602
On, on trying to like...

1761
01:23:24,603 --> 01:23:31,041
Set up healthy, uh...

1762
01:23:31,042 --> 01:23:33,510
Ways of...

1763
01:23:33,511 --> 01:23:37,447
Communicating and...

1764
01:23:37,448 --> 01:23:39,717
I don't, I don't know,
I don't know why.

1765
01:23:39,718 --> 01:23:41,619
Hey, the world's got
enough people you've gotta

1766
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:43,703
explain yourself to, right?

1767
01:23:58,703 --> 01:24:02,752
Tell me if that's shit or not.

1768
01:24:14,752 --> 01:24:17,754
Thanks for last
night, by the way.

1769
01:24:17,755 --> 01:24:18,689
For what?

1770
01:24:18,690 --> 01:24:21,959
For rebuffing me.

1771
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:24,394
Hey, what are friends for.

1772
01:24:24,395 --> 01:24:26,763
I've been thinking a lot this
morning about investment.

1773
01:24:26,764 --> 01:24:28,366
Yeah, that's not
weird or anything.

1774
01:24:28,367 --> 01:24:29,007
No, I'm serious.

1775
01:24:29,135 --> 01:24:32,003
I think you should
open your place.

1776
01:24:32,004 --> 01:24:33,244
Eh, that's not going to happen.

1777
01:24:33,245 --> 01:24:35,505
What if I helped you get
on your feet, get set up,

1778
01:24:35,506 --> 01:24:39,576
get a little seed
money or something?

1779
01:24:39,577 --> 01:24:42,979
Okay, I don't need
anything from you.

1780
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:44,848
I don't need help
or a favor or...

1781
01:24:44,849 --> 01:24:46,409
It wouldn't be a
favor, it'd be selfish.

1782
01:24:46,410 --> 01:24:49,387
I'd be making money off of you.

1783
01:24:49,388 --> 01:24:50,588
You're not being serious.

1784
01:24:50,589 --> 01:24:52,022
I'm totally serious.

1785
01:24:52,023 --> 01:24:54,058
Believe it or not, I'm a
pretty savvy businessman.

1786
01:24:54,059 --> 01:24:55,960
I know, but...

1787
01:24:55,961 --> 01:24:57,321
But what? Come on,
think about it.

1788
01:24:57,322 --> 01:25:06,737
Small place, lower east side,
12 tables, food from upstate.

1789
01:25:06,738 --> 01:25:09,973
Well, naturally the food
would have to be from upstate.

1790
01:25:09,974 --> 01:25:12,509
The dishes would be a
tasteful nod to the area's

1791
01:25:12,510 --> 01:25:15,812
fading Jewish and
Chinese denizens.

1792
01:25:15,813 --> 01:25:16,580
That's perfect.

1793
01:25:16,581 --> 01:25:18,516
Like uh, egg drop
matzo ball soup?

1794
01:25:18,517 --> 01:25:20,418
Yeah.

1795
01:25:20,419 --> 01:25:21,986
Szechuan brisket.

1796
01:25:21,987 --> 01:25:23,888
Got sweet and sour Kugel.

1797
01:25:23,889 --> 01:25:24,856
Mm.

1798
01:25:24,857 --> 01:25:26,089
Kung Pao...

1799
01:25:26,090 --> 01:25:27,825
Latkes?

1800
01:25:27,826 --> 01:25:29,626
Mm. That sounds really good.

1801
01:25:29,627 --> 01:25:30,527
That sounds terrible.

1802
01:25:30,528 --> 01:25:32,996
That does sound terrible.

1803
01:25:32,997 --> 01:25:35,165
What do you say?

1804
01:25:35,166 --> 01:25:39,072
Shake on it?

1805
01:25:40,672 --> 01:25:42,792
<i>Hey, you've reached Ben Kaplan's
cell phone.</i>

1806
01:25:42,793 --> 01:25:45,465
<i>Leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

1807
01:25:47,446 --> 01:25:50,915
He's just blowing off steam.

1808
01:25:50,916 --> 01:25:53,017
Josh, I really fucked up.

1809
01:25:53,018 --> 01:25:55,486
I know.

1810
01:25:55,487 --> 01:25:57,955
He'll get past it.

1811
01:25:57,956 --> 01:26:00,090
It's ironic, though.

1812
01:26:00,091 --> 01:26:01,793
Why?

1813
01:26:01,794 --> 01:26:03,754
I just thought that if you
were ever going to slip

1814
01:26:03,755 --> 01:26:06,691
up, it would be with me.

1815
01:26:27,486 --> 01:26:28,585
Thanks for the ride.

1816
01:26:28,586 --> 01:26:30,888
Yeah.

1817
01:26:30,889 --> 01:26:33,191
So you'll, you'll
consider the offer?

1818
01:26:33,192 --> 01:26:36,594
Yeah, absolutely.

1819
01:26:36,595 --> 01:26:40,697
It's really fucking
good, you know?

1820
01:26:40,698 --> 01:26:44,002
Quite an auspicious start.

1821
01:26:45,002 --> 01:26:48,772
I guess I have you to
thank for that also.

1822
01:26:48,773 --> 01:26:51,920
Well...

1823
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:02,820
Good dog!

1824
01:27:02,821 --> 01:27:05,760
Hey Timmy.

1825
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:10,928
Thanks guys.

1826
01:27:10,929 --> 01:27:12,897
Happy I passed on the insurance.

1827
01:27:12,898 --> 01:27:16,867
Tell them it was an elk.

1828
01:27:16,868 --> 01:27:19,070
In the shape of a tree?

1829
01:27:19,071 --> 01:27:22,841
It jumped out like an elk.

1830
01:27:23,841 --> 01:27:25,282
<i>He really can't drive.</i>

1831
01:27:30,282 --> 01:27:32,782
Alex, you got any crazy
glue in the house?

1832
01:27:32,783 --> 01:27:35,058
<i>You won't even notice.</i>

1833
01:27:40,058 --> 01:27:42,559
So, do you hate me?

1834
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:43,827
No.

1835
01:27:43,828 --> 01:27:46,902
I could never do that.

1836
01:27:49,902 --> 01:27:53,005
Are you sure?

1837
01:27:54,005 --> 01:27:55,272
Yeah.

1838
01:27:55,273 --> 01:27:57,176
I'm sure.

1839
01:28:01,713 --> 01:28:03,873
You know, I couldn't
believe my luck freshman

1840
01:28:03,874 --> 01:28:07,117
year when I found out your
place was across the hall.

1841
01:28:07,118 --> 01:28:11,621
Then when we actually
spoke, it was like I

1842
01:28:11,622 --> 01:28:14,892
wanted to throw away all
ideas of dumb luck and

1843
01:28:14,893 --> 01:28:18,963
start invoking God and
fate and a bunch of other

1844
01:28:18,964 --> 01:28:19,964
capitalized words.

1845
01:28:20,232 --> 01:28:22,232
Ben why are you
saying this right now?

1846
01:28:22,233 --> 01:28:24,193
'Cause when good things
happen, you always want to

1847
01:28:24,194 --> 01:28:29,068
imagine them as fated.

1848
01:28:29,942 --> 01:28:33,777
And when bad things happen, of
course the world's this

1849
01:28:33,778 --> 01:28:40,151
cold and brutally random place.

1850
01:28:40,152 --> 01:28:42,986
I'm scared of what the
world'd look like without you.

1851
01:28:42,987 --> 01:28:47,625
You can't stay with me
because you're scared.

1852
01:28:47,626 --> 01:28:49,263
You're right.

1853
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:58,736
How was that for an
introduction to my friends?

1854
01:28:58,737 --> 01:29:02,674
A bigger disaster than I
could possibly imagine.

1855
01:29:04,376 --> 01:29:06,978
You're telling me.

1856
01:29:06,979 --> 01:29:09,112
Now you're going to dump
me as soon as we're not

1857
01:29:09,113 --> 01:29:12,049
stuck together at 30,000 feet.

1858
01:29:12,050 --> 01:29:14,151
What are you talking about?

1859
01:29:14,152 --> 01:29:15,752
What do you mean what
am I talking about.

1860
01:29:15,753 --> 01:29:16,819
You just said it yourself.

1861
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:17,820
I'm...

1862
01:29:18,223 --> 01:29:20,357
I've made a total
fool of myself.

1863
01:29:20,358 --> 01:29:22,192
Baby, my friends
are the disaster.

1864
01:29:22,193 --> 01:29:23,893
You're amazing.

1865
01:29:23,894 --> 01:29:24,794
That's not true.

1866
01:29:24,795 --> 01:29:25,795
That's totally true.

1867
01:29:25,796 --> 01:29:28,667
You're the only sane
person here and you know it.

1868
01:29:29,667 --> 01:29:31,072
Hey.

1869
01:29:35,072 --> 01:29:36,388
I'm really glad you came.

1870
01:29:39,277 --> 01:29:40,844
You ready to meet my parents?

1871
01:29:40,845 --> 01:29:43,848
I don't think so.

1872
01:29:43,849 --> 01:29:46,282
I don't blame you. They're
fucking crazy.

1873
01:29:46,283 --> 01:29:49,157
Good Timmy.

1874
01:29:52,157 --> 01:29:56,727
So, we are all doomed,
romantically speaking.

1875
01:29:56,728 --> 01:29:59,930
Only on like a
deep karmic level.

1876
01:30:01,233 --> 01:30:03,812
For whatever reason, I'm
strangely okay with that.

1877
01:30:05,269 --> 01:30:06,437
- Yeah?
- What?

1878
01:30:06,438 --> 01:30:09,406
Maybe I'm turning
over a new leaf.

1879
01:30:09,407 --> 01:30:11,287
Maybe we should make one
of those pacts where if

1880
01:30:11,288 --> 01:30:15,912
we're still single when we're
35, we all just get married.

1881
01:30:15,913 --> 01:30:16,914
Who, the three of us?

1882
01:30:16,915 --> 01:30:20,017
Yes, and Timmy of course.

1883
01:30:20,018 --> 01:30:22,820
We'll make a great
dysfunctional family.

1884
01:30:22,821 --> 01:30:23,821
How's that sound Timmy?

1885
01:30:23,822 --> 01:30:26,093
I'd consider it.

1886
01:30:28,093 --> 01:30:29,893
Oh, hey, you going so soon?

1887
01:30:29,894 --> 01:30:31,696
<i>Flight to catch.</i>

1888
01:30:31,697 --> 01:30:33,337
We'll see if I can
rustle up Ben and Siri.

1889
01:30:33,338 --> 01:30:35,031
Thanks for coming, man.

1890
01:30:35,032 --> 01:30:35,967
See you soon, I hear?

1891
01:30:35,968 --> 01:30:37,735
Yeah, hopefully at
the end of the month.

1892
01:30:37,736 --> 01:30:38,869
I'm excited.

1893
01:30:38,870 --> 01:30:39,969
What does that mean?

1894
01:30:39,970 --> 01:30:41,890
Alex asked if there was
any openings at the place

1895
01:30:41,891 --> 01:30:43,558
I work, and I told
him there was a strong

1896
01:30:43,559 --> 01:30:46,009
likelihood I could
get him a job.

1897
01:30:46,010 --> 01:30:47,745
That's awesome.

1898
01:30:47,746 --> 01:30:48,713
Congratulations.

1899
01:30:48,714 --> 01:30:50,080
Thanks.

1900
01:30:50,081 --> 01:30:52,383
I think I have a strong resume.

1901
01:30:52,384 --> 01:30:54,485
Is that a suicide joke?

1902
01:30:54,486 --> 01:30:55,487
Too soon.

1903
01:31:05,229 --> 01:31:07,298
I'm going to miss you guys.

1904
01:31:07,299 --> 01:31:07,932
Not me.

1905
01:31:08,132 --> 01:31:10,334
I'll be checking
on my investment.

1906
01:31:10,335 --> 01:31:12,036
Ha, what investment?

1907
01:31:12,037 --> 01:31:13,303
Sarah's opening a restaurant.

1908
01:31:13,304 --> 01:31:15,004
- No I'm not.
- Is.

1909
01:31:15,005 --> 01:31:16,439
- No, what?
- He's...

1910
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:17,374
Crazy.

1911
01:31:17,375 --> 01:31:18,010
<i>Sarah.</i>

1912
01:31:18,210 --> 01:31:19,210
What?

1913
01:31:19,211 --> 01:31:21,091
Take the money before he
gets an even worse idea

1914
01:31:21,092 --> 01:31:22,963
what to do with it.

1915
01:31:25,916 --> 01:31:27,220
Where's your stuff?

1916
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:30,787
Yeah, about that.

1917
01:31:30,788 --> 01:31:32,156
I uh...

1918
01:31:32,157 --> 01:31:33,790
I think I'm hanging
around a while.

1919
01:31:33,791 --> 01:31:36,393
Seems like Ben got a good
idea for a story last

1920
01:31:36,394 --> 01:31:40,263
night and, so I told him
he should stay and write.

1921
01:31:40,264 --> 01:31:41,965
So staying was an option?

1922
01:31:41,966 --> 01:31:43,000
You, you could stay.

1923
01:31:43,001 --> 01:31:43,867
I don't want to stay.

1924
01:31:43,868 --> 01:31:44,501
You want to stay?

1925
01:31:44,502 --> 01:31:45,503
No, I don't want to stay.

1926
01:31:45,504 --> 01:31:47,224
I'm sorry, can we take
a group photo please?

1927
01:31:47,225 --> 01:31:47,972
Yes.

1928
01:31:47,973 --> 01:31:48,505
I thought, I thought
we talked about this.

1929
01:31:48,506 --> 01:31:50,174
I know, but please.

1930
01:31:50,175 --> 01:31:52,442
You've got time for
exactly one photo.

1931
01:31:52,443 --> 01:31:53,376
Here, I'll take it.

1932
01:31:53,377 --> 01:31:54,245
Thank you Kate.

1933
01:31:54,246 --> 01:31:55,345
Thank you.

1934
01:31:55,346 --> 01:31:56,506
<i>The car is dying to be in it.</i>

1935
01:31:56,507 --> 01:31:58,148
<i>We have to.</i>

1936
01:31:58,149 --> 01:32:00,029
<i>Yeah, and don't forget
to get my shoes in baby.</i>

1937
01:32:00,030 --> 01:32:00,951
<i>Oho, please.</i>

1938
01:32:00,952 --> 01:32:02,519
<i>Frame up for the shoes, please.</i>

1939
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:04,402
<i>It's the most important part.</i>

1940
01:32:17,402 --> 01:32:18,335
Alex, right?

1941
01:32:18,336 --> 01:32:19,402
Yeah.

1942
01:32:19,403 --> 01:32:20,877
You can join us if you want.

1943
01:32:21,206 --> 01:32:23,879
Oh, cool thanks.

1944
01:32:27,879 --> 01:32:30,513
I send you on a mission
for sugar, you bring back

1945
01:32:30,514 --> 01:32:32,049
a lost boy.

1946
01:32:32,050 --> 01:32:33,150
Hey man, I'm Josh.

1947
01:32:33,151 --> 01:32:35,318
Hey, Alex.

1948
01:32:35,319 --> 01:32:37,287
Um, I don't think we met. I'm
Ben.

1949
01:32:37,288 --> 01:32:37,922
Siri.

1950
01:32:38,122 --> 01:32:38,688
Oh, I'm sorry.

1951
01:32:38,689 --> 01:32:39,956
Ben, Siri. Siri, Ben.

1952
01:32:39,957 --> 01:32:41,025
Nice to meet you.

1953
01:32:41,026 --> 01:32:43,027
I think we're in the same dorm.

1954
01:32:43,028 --> 01:32:44,161
Yeah. Yeah?

1955
01:32:44,162 --> 01:32:50,169
Exactly. That's... shocking I
haven't met you before.

1956
01:32:51,169 --> 01:32:53,403
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

1957
01:32:53,404 --> 01:32:54,237
Isaac.

1958
01:32:54,238 --> 01:32:55,472
Josh.

1959
01:32:55,473 --> 01:32:57,241
Did you get enough
macaroni and cheese?

1960
01:32:57,242 --> 01:32:58,442
Shut up, Josh.

1961
01:32:58,443 --> 01:32:59,576
Did you order the Mountain?

1962
01:32:59,577 --> 01:33:01,111
Sh-I got this. Shut up Josh.

1963
01:33:01,112 --> 01:33:02,215
Hi. I'm Sarah.

1964
01:33:03,215 --> 01:33:04,247
Hi, Alex.

1965
01:33:04,248 --> 01:33:05,249
Nice to meet you.

1966
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:06,536
Nice to meet you too.

1967
01:33:09,153 --> 01:33:11,554
Ignore him, anything he says.

1968
01:33:11,555 --> 01:33:13,389
Can you believe these guys?

1969
01:33:13,390 --> 01:33:14,929
I'm sure you'll fit right in.

1970
01:33:17,929 --> 01:33:21,464
Ben, want to just take a
solo, or do you want to

1971
01:33:21,465 --> 01:33:23,272
join the group?

1972
01:33:27,272 --> 01:33:28,506
Come on.

1973
01:33:29,506 --> 01:33:31,310
Alright, posture everyone.

1974
01:33:32,910 --> 01:33:35,178
Uh, I'm going to need
you to get a lot closer

1975
01:33:35,179 --> 01:33:37,582
together than that.

1976
01:33:38,582 --> 01:33:39,650
Okay.

1977
01:33:39,651 --> 01:33:41,184
Come on, come on.

1978

Alright.

1979
01:33:42,153 --> 01:33:43,753
I'm going to pose a

1980
01:33:43,754 --> 01:33:46,224

1981
01:33:46,824 --> 01:33:48,104

1982
01:33:48,126 --> 01:33:49,026

1983
01:33:49,027 --> 01:33:50,661

01:33:50,662 --> 01:33:53,665
