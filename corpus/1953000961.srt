1
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:29,124
It's just us now, guys.

2
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:32,493
I'll always love and protect you.

3
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:35,328
You'll always be my baby boys.

4
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,904
But I won't be around forever.

5
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,168
So you have to learn
to take care of each other.

6
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,402
You have to protect each other.

7
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,744
Don't ever forget that.

8
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,752
<i>You think you know what's real,</i>

9
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,627
<i>but you don't</i>.

10
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:48,070
Oh, maybe we should go back now.

11
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,108
You should relax.

12
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,609
Did you hear that?

13
00:01:56,749 --> 00:02:00,185
If you mean the blood rushing to my crotch,
then yes, I heard it.

14
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,720
I know you heard that.

15
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,333
- God, Lori.
- What if it's Travis?

16
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,834
- He knows we're together.
- We don't need to rub it in his face.

17
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,371
I'm not rubbing anything
in anybody's face.

18
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,498
I'm just making out
with my girlfriend.

19
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,610
Why are you so worried
about Travis?

20
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:27,110
I think he's been pretty cool
about everything.

21
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,772
I'm just finding it hard to believe
he's gotten over it so fast.

22
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:34,216
- Because there's just no getting over you?
- No. You jerk.

23
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,879
It's just stuff he used to say.

24
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,014
Like what?

25
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,093
It doesn't matter.

26
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:43,661
Look, I'm just not sure this little trip
was a good idea.

27
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,821
- Do you want me to do something?
- God, no!

28
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:48,490
- Don't make any trouble, okay?
- Then relax.

29
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,229
He's with Nadine now, all right?

30
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:54,067
He's over you, okay?

31
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:04,541
- Do you want me to take a look around?
- Yeah.

32
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:16,390
Jesus! Henry, you scared
the crap out of me.

33
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,164
Shut up.

34
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,274
I didn't say anything.

35
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,638
Did you... come here by yourself?

36
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,411
You like to keep
an eye on me, don't you?

37
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,790
There you are.
I'm sorry if he's bothering you, guys.

38
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,294
He must have wandered off
while we weren't paying attention.

39
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,456
No problem, man.

40
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,091
I was really worried
for a minute there, buddy.

41
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,868
What are you guys doing
all the way up here?

42
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,237
We just needed to grab
something from the car.

43
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,745
And... got it.

44
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,686
And it's okay, Henry.
I know you didn't mean to scare me.

45
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:27,962
Dude, I offered. Well, I said,
"Whose is this?" That's kind of like offering.

46
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,505
Are there bears around here?

47
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,074
Yes, there are.

48
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,074
- They're black bears.
- Tigers.

49
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,644
They won't eat much.

50
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,907
I don't think you have to worry about tigers
at this time of year.

51
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,516
They tend goats out here.

52
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,347
- That's scary.
- You afraid of goats, man?

53
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,287
I think maybe they should
be afraid of you.

54
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,795
Are you on crack?

55
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,489
Oh, sorry.

56
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,606
Let's play a game or something.

57
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,333
Yeah, that's a good idea.

58
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,273
- What?
- I don't know.

59
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,879
How about "Hide the Sausage"?

60
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,641
Perv.

61
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,516
How about "Flashlight Tag"?

62
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:55,314
Oh, my God! I haven't
played that in so long.

63
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,787
- Yeah, that'd be so fun.
- That'd be so gay.

64
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,915
- Come on.
- Comin' from a dude in those pants?

65
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,856
What? They're Levis.

66
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:05,657
I guess it's just how tight they are
that make 'em look like Jordache.

67
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,663
Come on. I want to play.

68
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,200
- I'll get the flashlight.
- Okay, come on.

69
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,235
Watch your step.

70
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,307
I got it.

71
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,209
You okay, pal?

72
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:34,057
Be careful! Oh, my gosh!

73
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,271
Uncle Greggie's comin' to town,

74
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,810
and he's liquored up
and pissed off.

75
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,310
Oh, we got a climber.

76
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,475
You suck.

77
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,859
Save some for Daddy.

78
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,863
Hey.

79
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:20,871
I love a woman that can hold her liquor,
you know what I'm sayin'?

80
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,206
So, you wanna go
back to the tent?

81
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,507
- Sure.
- All right.

82
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,923
God, I hate being "it. "

83
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:02,212
I can hear you.
You're gonna be "it," whoever it is.

84
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:28,666
Don't! It's cold.

85
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,776
So...

86
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,707
warm it up.

87
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,412
Hello?

88
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,784
We're done playin', man.

89
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,260
We're kinda busy in here.

90
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,260
Oh, shit!

91
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:00,895
- He killed them.
- What?

92
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,237
They're all dead.
He killed them!

93
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,038
What are you talking about?
What happened, Travis?

94
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,805
Henry... he killed them.

95
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,380
Henry?

96
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:12,245
Oh, God, Travis, you've got blood
all over you. Are you hurt?

97
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,579
I don't think so.

98
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,119
Let's get a blanket on him.

99
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:17,654
Are you sure they're dead?

100
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,314
I don't know.

101
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,723
Look, just stay with him.

102
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,329
What do you mean?
What are you doing?

103
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:26,590
Wait, where are you going?
We gotta get outta here.

104
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,166
- We gotta get some help.
- What if they're still alive, Sarah?

105
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,769
We can't just
leave 'em out there.

106
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,962
Travis, what happened?
Why would Henry do this?

107
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:34,902
Bobby and I got into a fight,

108
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,838
and Henry...
he just lost control.

109
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,273
Is he still up there?

110
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,971
He ran away.

111
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,775
Hike back to the car,
take Travis and get some help.

112
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,907
Wait a minute.
We're not leaving you here.

113
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,849
- All right. Just stay here.
- No, wait, wait.

114
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,251
- Take a weapon or something.
- We don't have any weapons.

115
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,619
What about that ax you guys
were using to cut firewood?

116
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,726
All right.

117
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,168
Where is it?

118
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,701
Travis, do you know
where the ax is?

119
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,101
Henry had it.

120
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:18,881
Who's there?

121
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,789
What happened?

122
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:35,728
Oh, my God, honey. It's gonna be okay.
We're gonna get you some help.

123
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:51,349
Oh, my God. Greg,
you gotta get us out of here.

124
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,510
I gotta find out if Bobby and Lori are still alive.
I can't just leave 'em out there.

125
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,622
Oh, my God.
This is so fucked up.

126
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,917
Just wait here.
I'll be right back.

127
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,196
It's okay.

128
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,997
I'm gonna help you.

129
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,365
There's nothing to be afraid of.

130
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:29,804
If I was gonna hurt you
or turn you in,

131
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,206
I would have already done it.

132
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:33,777
Right?

133
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,443
That's it.

134
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,347
Try to relax.

135
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,548
My name's Al.

136
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,857
I think you got a break
in that arm.

137
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:53,260
Put a in-bush cast on it.
Should do the trick.

138
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,866
Ever had any of this stuff?

139
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,835
Well, it's a good time to start.

140
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,702
Come on. Have a sip.

141
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:10,711
Sorry.

142
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,284
Not used to pouring
into someone else's mouth.

143
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,852
You okay?

144
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,720
Good. Have some more.

145
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,556
That was some fall you took.

146
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:31,699
With all that blood on you,
I thought you were dead for sure.

147
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,105
But that's not all
your own blood.

148
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,938
Is it?

149
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,711
It's okay. We can talk
about that later. Here.

150
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:52,086
Right now, we gotta
clean up these wounds.

151
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,020
Don't worry.

152
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,254
I've done this before.

153
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:34,366
Mostly to myself.

154
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,765
Whiskey should help.
But I'm not gonna lie to you.

155
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,427
It's still gonna hurt.

156
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:43,803
Not any worse than that fall though.
I can guarantee you that.

157
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,877
You just try to hold still.

158
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,741
If you move, it'll make it worse.

159
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,686
You're a tough kid, Henry.

160
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,957
Toughest I've ever seen.

161
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,877
Well, your modeling career
might be over,

162
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,511
but you're gonna
heal up okay I think.

163
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,889
Here.

164
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,097
Don't worry. It's just water.

165
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,330
Oh, you like that?

166
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,570
Be my guest.

167
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,180
We got something in common,
you and me.

168
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,216
I'm not talkin' about the whiskey.

169
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,915
Do you know what
I am talkin' about?

170
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,452
I'm talkin' about this.

171
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:18,196
I'm talkin' about what's behind that.

172
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,599
Oh, I got somethin' for you.

173
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,309
Some interesting stuff in there.

174
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,113
I like the ones of that woman.

175
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,887
Is she your mom?

176
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,397
They've already
started lookin' for you.

177
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,269
They'll be here soon.

178
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,205
Now...

179
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:01,506
as I see it,
you got three options.

180
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,376
You can keep runnin'.

181
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:06,484
If you do that, you'll either die out here
or they'll catch you.

182
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:07,983
You can turn yourself in.

183
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,987
If you do that,
they'll put you away for sure.

184
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:15,355
You won't go home to your mom,
I can guarantee you that.

185
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,485
Or you can stay with me.

186
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:24,127
I can hide you
so they won't find you.

187
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,761
They'll come and talk to me and
I'll tell 'em I don't know anything.

188
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:30,670
Then they'll take me to town
and ask me again

189
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,403
and I'll tell 'em
I still don't know anything.

190
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:36,309
And then they'll just
go away eventually.

191
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,474
I can teach you how
to survive out here.

192
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:45,022
I won't judge you, Henry.

193
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:48,854
That's what I heard them
call you, right? Henry?

194
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,628
Well, I won't judge you.

195
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,929
We can look out
for each other.

196
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:01,131
I got no time
for most people.

197
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:05,937
Most people are weak
and they judge you on... this.

198
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,305
Or they judge you
on one action...

199
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,849
rather than what's
in your heart.

200
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,515
I know what's
in your heart, Henry.

201
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,181
I saw it out there.

202
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,658
I see it in your eyes.

203
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,664
You gotta decide right now.
They'll be on top of us soon.

204
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,766
What's it gonna be?

205
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:57,120
I'll bring you
food and water when I can.

206
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:01,164
You can't ever step foot out of here
until I come and get you.

207
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,063
Okay?

208
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,730
Afterwards, no light at night.

209
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,034
And no fires ever.

210
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,234
The smoke will give away
your position.

211
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,471
It'll get cold in here at night,

212
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,514
but you're a tough kid.

213
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:20,083
Right?

214
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,821
You understand all that?

215
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:26,857
It's gonna be okay.

216
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:29,559
Trust me.

217
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,472
Come in.

218
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,206
Hey.

219
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,406
How you doin', man?

220
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,721
Did she talk to you?

221
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,756
Your mom?

222
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:35,257
She hasn't been talkin' much.

223
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:38,727
She didn't say much to us either.

224
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,860
We just stopped by to see
if you wanted to go grab a bite.

225
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:46,596
You know,
get out of the house.

226
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,307
You know how his face
got like that?

227
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,412
You mean Henry?

228
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:57,140
Yeah.

229
00:21:57,282 --> 00:22:00,683
No. I mean,
we know he got burned.

230
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:04,311
One of Mom's boyfriends
was fighting with her

231
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:08,483
and got pretty rough,
more so than usual.

232
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,686
He knocked her unconscious.

233
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:16,160
I wasn't here for this one,
but Henry was.

234
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:19,634
Henry jumped on him, started
really going into the guy.

235
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:24,938
Tore one of his ears nearly
all the way off his head.

236
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,045
The asshole
grabbed a pot of water

237
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,080
that was boiling on the stovetop
and tossed it into his face.

238
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,183
Oh, my God.

239
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,246
That was the only time I've ever seen
Henry do something violent.

240
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:38,583
The only time.

241
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,887
Hey, none of us saw it coming.

242
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:49,661
They stopped lookin' for him,
you know.

243
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:52,793
They found his shirt
and one of his shoes.

244
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,572
We're really
sorry about all this.

245
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,714
It's hard to know what to say.

246
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:10,550
But you know that you can call us anytime
and we'll be there for you.

247
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:13,487
Yeah, anytime.

248
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,616
Thanks.

249
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,721
You wanna grab something
to eat with us?

250
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:27,265
Okay, we'll stop by
later in the week.

251
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,839
Okay?

252
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,965
- Ow!
- Get over there!

253
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:05,592
Henry! Henry, what are you doing?

254
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,143
Thanks.

255
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,017
Travis.

256
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:01,791
Yeah?

257
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:04,259
It's not your fault, honey.

258
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:15,031
It's not your fault.

259
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:52,674
You better get that look
out of your eyes, boy.

260
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:55,371
You think I like doing that?

261
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:59,574
I would expect you to know the difference
between violence and discipline.

262
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,982
Some people got it comin'.

263
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,782
I told you no lights at night!

264
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,824
I told you that to protect you!

265
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,427
You said you understood,

266
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,962
but you still used the light at night!

267
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,588
I saw it, Henry!

268
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,633
That's disrespect!

269
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,565
That is disobedience!

270
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:27,478
We will not survive out here if you can't listen
to me and do what I tell you to do.

271
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:34,207
Do you understand that?

272
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:41,991
Okay.

273
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:50,299
You have to show me
some respect

274
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:53,563
and follow the rules
that I lay down.

275
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:57,072
It's the only way we'll
make it out here together.

276
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:19,691
It's been over three months now.

277
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:24,029
They're not even talkin' about it at the store
or on the street anymore.

278
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,933
They're on to the next headline.

279
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,999
Ah, they forget.

280
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:34,043
But they never forgive, Henry.

281
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,076
They never forgive.

282
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,780
That's why we're out here.

283
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:47,281
I want you to wear this
from now on.

284
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,818
At least when I'm around.

285
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,417
Go ahead. Put it on.

286
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,107
I did a lot of work in that.

287
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:15,337
It's not too uncomfortable, right?

288
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,519
You know I care about you, Henry.

289
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:30,292
And I like being around you.

290
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:34,228
But you don't have to look at that face
all the time like I do.

291
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:03,758
You okay?

292
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:06,295
When's it gonna stop?
Do they think I don't notice?

293
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,422
What were they doing?
Tell me what happened.

294
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:12,127
I didn't do anything and I don't want to be
treated like a fucking murderer!

295
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,830
- How long is this gonna go on?
- Were they staring again?

296
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:17,066
They don't just stare, Mom!

297
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,371
Okay, honey.
I'm not doubting you.

298
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:22,911
I'm at the store

299
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,505
and I can hear them
on the other side of the aisle.

300
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:32,285
I'm not making it up.
I'm not imagining it.

301
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,448
I believe you.

302
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,731
<i>You should leave here, honey</i>.

303
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:49,772
<i>You know,</i>
<i>you're done with school</i>.

304
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,500
<i>You could be closer to work</i>.

305
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:53,338
<i>There's no reason to stay here</i>.

306
00:31:56,848 --> 00:32:00,147
<i>You're not your father, Travis</i>.

307
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,617
<i>And you're still</i>
<i>young enough to start over</i>.

308
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,279
<i>You can leave all this behind you</i>.

309
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,851
Shit, you guys,
there's a weird man over there!

310
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,532
- Get off him right now!
- You're dead, dude!

311
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:20,763
Bobby, get off of him!
Stop it, you guys!

312
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,835
Get off him!

313
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:27,008
Henry!

314
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,740
- Here you go.
- Hey, thanks.

315
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,844
I can't believe
you actually have a pool.

316
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:36,879
Yeah, well, it's paycheck to paycheck
as long as I'm renting this place.

317
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,744
Well, you gotta let us come swim.

318
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,578
We promise we won't pee in it.

319
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:45,988
You guys can come over any time
you'd like for a small membership fee.

320
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,217
You picked
a great neighborhood, man.

321
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,419
We drove all around here
when we were looking for a place,

322
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:52,688
but there was nothing available.

323
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,628
You're gonna like it here.

324
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:58,793
- To new beginnings.
- Cheers, man.

325
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,591
Excuse me.
Sorry to bug you,

326
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,925
but I'm looking for this address,
and I can't find the street.

327
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,465
- I know I'm close.
- Let me see.

328
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,363
Oh, you are close.
It's a cul-de-sac.

329
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:35,302
Go down to the end of this street,
take a left and keep looking to your right.

330
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,567
It's the second or third street.
You can't miss it.

331
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,575
- You'd be surprised.
- Want me to show you?

332
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:43,043
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm sure I'll find it now.

333
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:45,911
- Okay.
- Have you lived here long?

334
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,211
A couple months. Why?

335
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:52,379
I'm supposed to be looking at a rental.
That's what this address is.

336
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,323
It's a pretty good neighborhood.

337
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,189
No problems so far.

338
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,296
You look like
you could be trouble.

339
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,097
Yeah, I'm wanted in 49 states.

340
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:06,601
This is my last hope.

341
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:10,806
How do you feel about roommates?

342
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:15,005
- Roommates?
- Just one.

343
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:18,673
I don't know. I just got
out of the roommate thing.

344
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:20,750
I have a pool.

345
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:23,319
I'm listening.

346
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,552
The bedrooms
are about the same size.

347
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:29,285
Right, so we can just
split it down the middle.

348
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:32,453
You don't have any unusual habits
I should know about, do you?

349
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:35,122
I'll only sell crack
from my side of the house.

350
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:36,528
Cool.

351
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:43,366
And even if one of us becomes
attracted to the other,

352
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:46,568
we keep things platonic
so it doesn't get weird.

353
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,440
Absolutely.

354
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,240
We have a deal then.

355
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:51,439
Deal.

356
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:30,279
Take off your helmet.

357
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:38,454
It's okay. Take it off.

358
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:50,766
You know what the hardest part
of bein' a father is?

359
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:56,298
It's bein' a second-class parent.

360
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:01,402
That's what we are, you know.

361
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:04,742
Fathers.

362
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,873
Second-class parents.

363
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,419
Get a divorce,
the kid lives with the mother.

364
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:18,995
Kid goes to jail,
it's the father's fault.

365
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:25,930
I swear to Christ, a woman could set her child
on fire and get a second chance.

366
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,630
We make one mistake...

367
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,400
and it's over.

368
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:39,378
I was a good father, Henry.

369
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:50,959
I know you don't know
where your father is, but I...

370
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:53,427
I'll bet you, at some point...

371
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,865
he was misinterpreted.

372
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:02,269
Forced to do something
he didn't want to do.

373
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:04,840
I can guarantee you that.

374
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,165
You're a smart kid, Henry.

375
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,068
I know you understand a lot.

376
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,384
I know you understand
that without me,

377
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:51,284
you'd be in a very
bad place right now.

378
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:56,985
I also know you understand how much
I've sacrificed to keep you here with me.

379
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:01,753
Most importantly,

380
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:06,529
I know how much you understand protecting
the people who treat you right

381
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,763
and love you,

382
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,397
and punishing the people
who treat you wrong

383
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,908
and hurt you.

384
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:24,083
I have a map
I want you to look at.

385
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:42,247
They'll be looking for me soon.

386
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,990
They'll wanna ask me
some questions.

387
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,768
You have to go back to the cave.

388
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:58,306
- What's happening, brother?
- How are you?

389
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:00,376
- Good to see you, man.
- Good to see you.

390
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:01,910
- Good to meet you.
- Finally.

391
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,446
- This is Greg.
- Hey, heard a lot about you.

392
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,947
Me too.

393
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:09,280
You look like hell, man.
Can I get you a beer?

394
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,944
Dude, I am beer, all right?

395
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,056
So you understand then?

396
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:16,057
Yeah, I guess. I just thought
you'd want to share it with her.

397
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:19,526
No, Lorraine's the first girl
I've met in a long time

398
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:21,654
who doesn't know
anything about it.

399
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,164
I love that.

400
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,359
I love the freedom to decide.

401
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:28,096
She just knows
what I want her to know.

402
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:29,933
And I like it that way.

403
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:33,810
That's why I moved down here.

404
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:38,213
She thinks Henry died
in a car accident?

405
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:39,907
Yeah.

406
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:45,446
Okay. It's your decision.

407
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:47,682
I'm behind you
whatever you want to do.

408
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:50,589
Thanks, man.
I better get back out there.

409
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,502
You can be anything
you want to be.

410
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:06,323
Come on, Dave.

411
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:09,091
Come on, man. We been hikin'
out here for over two hours

412
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:11,167
and we haven't even
seen a snake.

413
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:14,600
We're not even supposed to be huntin'
out here, let alone without a license.

414
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:16,763
Come on. Let's just go home,
all right?

415
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:19,842
Just admit this was a bad idea
and let it go, man.

416
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:24,380
Look, I don't hunt in some forest where there's
50 other drunk guys with guns, all right?

417
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:28,144
We're breakin' a few rules, but this is war,
man. There are no rules in war.

418
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,116
It's not war, it's sport killin'.

419
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:33,655
But I'm at war with Kim right now,
and I can't kill her so I gotta kill something.

420
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,850
Got any more of that gum?

421
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:39,952
I'm serious. I'm tired and I think
we may be lost. Let's get the hell out of here.

422
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:44,295
I'm not lost and I didn't come
this far to not kill something.

423
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,902
All right.
Well, here's the deal.

424
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:48,664
I'm staying right here.

425
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:52,207
I'm gonna park my ass against that tree
and have a little candy bar

426
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:54,071
and maybe take a little nap.

427
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:57,942
And since you're not lost,
you can find me on the way back.

428
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:02,752
And don't shoot me.

429
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:04,581
You got it.

430
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:30,505
Here, bunny, bunny, bunny.

431
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:32,410
Son of a bitch.

432
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:46,926
I'm sorry.
Is this your land?

433
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:13,886
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

434
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:21,329
Mikey! Mikey!

435
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:22,864
Get up!

436
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,594
Man. I did fall asleep.
What's up?

437
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,636
Dude, I think
we should get out of here.

438
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:30,365
I just ran into some fucked-up
looking guy with a hatchet.

439
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:33,533
- Well, so what? You got a gun.
- I don't wanna shoot him.

440
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:36,612
I don't even know if he's dangerous,
but what if it's his land?

441
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:40,046
- We should get out of here.
- Now look who wants to go home.

442
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:58,259
Help me!

443
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:01,065
Help me!

444
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,500
Help!

445
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:06,140
Help!

446
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:14,543
Help!

447
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,450
Oh, God. Come on.

448
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:19,817
Come on, come on!

449
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,391
Shit!

450
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:41,305
Oh, God. Thank God.
You gotta help me, mister.

451
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:42,969
There's some
fuckin' lunatic out there.

452
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:45,240
He killed my friend.
We gotta get some help.

453
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:48,818
Take it easy.
Everything's gonna be okay.

454
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,753
Sorry, pal. I really am.

455
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,325
But some people got it comin'.

456
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:06,926
I wanna go home.

457
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:15,328
People are gonna come
look for those men.

458
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:27,910
They had to have parked
somewhere around here.

459
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:31,919
Sooner or later, someone will find their car
and start lookin' around.

460
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,088
Good-bye, Henry.

461
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:35,417
We'll be partners and
you guys can be partners.

462
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:39,454
Well, actually, you're gonna need a teammate
because it says, "Choose teams. "

463
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:42,490
That's how you start.

464
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:47,359
Oh, God. Okay, okay,
the hint is... it's a thing.

465
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,397
That's very helpful.

466
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:53,060
- You can't spell it out! You're cheating!
- I'm sculpting.

467
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:55,296
- No! No, no, no, no.
- This is legal.

468
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:58,032
- You gotta sculpt...
- Take a guess!

469
00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:59,904
That was D.N.A.

470
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:02,273
How are you supposed
to sculpt D.N. A?

471
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:05,347
Well, obviously, you didn't.
Okay, okay, my turn.

472
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:09,548
- Really?
- He so totally has it.

473
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,654
- You're good.
- The colon?

474
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:13,312
Am I close?

475
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:16,516
The cheat book.
Hitler! It's Hitler!

476
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:19,128
Between the nose
and the mouth, that thing.

477
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:21,321
Oh, my God. You suck at this.

478
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:23,729
It's okay.

479
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,836
- Moustache?
- Yes!

480
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:29,268
- Is it our turn?
- Yeah.

481
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:31,601
- I got this one. I got it.
- Why does it look like Hitler?

482
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:36,508
He's got a very famous moustache.
I figured you'd be familiar with it.

483
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:52,788
Hello?

484
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,998
What?

485
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:58,100
Well, what happened?

486
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:02,064
What's wrong?
What happened?

487
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:06,198
- Mom's sick. She's in the hospital.
- What do you mean, sick?

488
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:09,244
She just collapsed.
They don't know what's wrong yet.

489
00:54:23,226 --> 00:54:25,694
Sooner or later
it catches up to you.

490
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:31,531
I saw it coming
and I just ignored it.

491
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:40,007
She's the only person who can make
me feel okay about everything.

492
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:05,100
- Hey.
- Hey. I made coffee.

493
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:07,294
Thanks.

494
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:21,449
She really wants
to be at home.

495
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:38,894
Your mom really wants
to be at home.

496
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:44,437
There's no reason for her
to be at the hospital anymore.

497
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:49,111
Should we call hospice?

498
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:54,978
Yeah, okay.

499
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:59,383
Do you want me to call
from work this afternoon?

500
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:04,225
Sure. Thanks.

501
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,056
Okay.

502
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:10,290
I gotta run.

503
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:21,367
This is what he told my dad.

504
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:24,446
That's my terminology for getting rid
of the birth controls...

505
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:26,105
pulling the goalie.

506
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:28,080
Yeah, of course.

507
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,277
Everything's in
hockey terms, you know.

508
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,285
At least you'll have
a good time going there.

509
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:35,220
Oh, dear.

510
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:37,849
Is that the names
you're thinking of?

511
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:40,258
Now what do you want?
Do you want a boy or a girl?

512
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:43,161
Just healthy.

513
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:45,859
- I'll give you a hand.
- Thanks.

514
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:51,496
So, I was thinking

515
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:53,836
that maybe we could do this
for you a couple times a week.

516
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:57,936
'Cause I know you've been spending
a lot of time with your mom lately.

517
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:01,312
I thought it might be easier for you
if you didn't have to worry about cooking.

518
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:06,055
That is unless you think
you'd get sick of us.

519
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:08,453
I mean, we'd understand
if you wanted to be alone.

520
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:19,468
You okay?

521
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:24,802
Yeah. I'll be right back, Sarah.

522
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:44,684
It's okay.

523
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:48,155
It's okay. It's nothing.

524
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,929
- We're gonna get home and be hungry again.
- You know it.

525
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:56,834
- I know it.
- You okay, honey?

526
00:57:56,973 --> 00:58:00,409
Yeah. Anybody
want some coffee?

527
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,300
What's wrong?

528
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:34,701
Nothing.

529
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,703
Travis, you're hurting me!

530
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:09,778
Travis, stop!

531
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:13,875
I'm sorry.

532
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:19,949
Would you please tell me
what's wrong?

533
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:24,150
God, I know you're upset about your mom,
but don't take your frustration out on me!

534
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:31,796
Ever since she got sick,
you've... you've shut down.

535
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:37,531
Would you say something,
please!

536
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:11,571
I am so sorry about last night.

537
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,437
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

538
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:18,240
I don't know why I did that.

539
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:21,839
But I promise you
it will never happen again.

540
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:30,058
Okay.

541
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:33,219
I just need you to talk to me and tell me
what's going on in your head, okay?

542
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:35,024
Okay.

543
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:25,571
- Hey.
- Hey.

544
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:27,649
How you feeling?

545
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:31,881
Oh, I feel fine.

546
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:35,957
Good. I want you to feel fine.

547
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,892
Where's Lorraine?

548
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:46,260
She's in the kitchen.

549
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:50,501
Oh.

550
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:54,141
You didn't kill her yet?

551
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:57,972
What?

552
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:03,784
You didn't kill her yet?

553
01:02:08,624 --> 01:02:10,751
Why are you saying that?

554
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:20,399
Mom?

555
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,938
'Cause you're a fuckin' murderer!

556
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:32,038
Is she talking today?

557
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:34,943
No.

558
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:57,934
Trav, can we talk for a minute?

559
01:02:58,074 --> 01:03:02,135
My head is killing me.
I really gotta get some sleep.

560
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:03,745
Okay.

561
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:07,577
I think I'm gonna
stay up for a little while.

562
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:09,685
Have a good night.

563
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:21,224
He has no idea what's going on.

564
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:32,236
Wait till he sees
what we have planned for him.

565
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,735
Lorraine?

566
01:03:40,883 --> 01:03:43,010
He doesn't know.

567
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:47,617
Lorraine, who are you talking to?

568
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,797
Lorraine?

569
01:03:58,601 --> 01:04:00,592
I'm not Lorraine.

570
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:18,349
No, I don't know why.

571
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:29,526
I really wanna talk to you
about all this.

572
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:37,898
No, he's still sleeping.

573
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:44,340
Can we get together later?

574
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:48,382
Thanks. God, I don't know
what I'd do without you right now.

575
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:53,551
I gotta go. Yeah, bye.

576
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:57,783
Hey.

577
01:04:57,927 --> 01:05:00,122
Who was that?

578
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:02,060
Just Sarah.

579
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,327
Oh.

580
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:07,834
How are you feeling
this morning?

581
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:11,129
Okay.

582
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:13,572
Are you going to your mom's?

583
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:17,235
Yeah.

584
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,974
I'll have to meet you there later.

585
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:23,711
I'm gonna get some groceries.
We're out of everything.

586
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:25,753
Sure.

587
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:16,434
Yeah, Mom, that's me.

588
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,169
I'm having...

589
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:23,676
a lot of trouble right now, Mom.

590
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:27,544
I really wish you had made me
get some help a long time ago.

591
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:33,085
I'm really scared.

592
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:36,891
Is he still here?

593
01:06:37,026 --> 01:06:39,324
Who?

594
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:41,396
Henry.

595
01:06:44,433 --> 01:06:48,494
No, Mom. Henry's been gone
a long time.

596
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:52,096
He came to visit me.

597
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:57,341
That's not possible.

598
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,311
Ah, sure it is.

599
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:02,911
He gave me this.

600
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:17,725
Have you been talking to Lorraine?

601
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:19,858
Did she put you up to this?

602
01:07:20,002 --> 01:07:21,492
No.

603
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:25,038
Who then? Greg?
It was Greg, right?

604
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:30,909
This is an old sketch.
Henry wasn't here, Mom.

605
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,412
Yes, he was.

606
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:34,914
No, he wasn't!

607
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,482
Is everything okay?

608
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:40,919
Has anybody else been
to visit my mom recently?

609
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,649
No. Why?

610
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:45,056
Are you sure
everything's all right?

611
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:50,630
Lorraine!

612
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:13,922
<i>You know how his face got like that?</i>

613
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:21,428
Lorraine!

614
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:25,293
- Hey, Tami.
- Hi.

615
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:28,926
- Is Travis back there?
- No. He left a little while ago.

616
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:32,063
Oh. Thanks.

617
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:03,396
<i>You better murder this woman</i>.

618
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:17,746
No!

619
01:10:07,436 --> 01:10:09,427
Who are you?

620
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:17,643
I know who they want me
to think you are,

621
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:20,874
but you can tell Lorraine and Greg
that it's not gonna work.

622
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:27,784
They think that if I lose it, they can just leave
me behind and live happily ever after.

623
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:29,584
Right?

624
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:33,126
Well, I know what's real
and what isn't.

625
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:38,128
I know you're not real!

626
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:56,609
I just wanted them to feel some
of the pain that I was feeling.

627
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:03,554
They don't understand
how we feel things.

628
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:10,588
I heard them.
They were planning something.

629
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:13,793
We had to do it, Henry.

630
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:19,570
I never wanted
Nadine to get hurt.

631
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:24,139
I never thought
you'd run like that.

632
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:29,408
It just didn't happen
the way I wanted it to happen.

633
01:11:36,492 --> 01:11:38,551
I'm sorry, Henry.

634
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:43,196
I swear, I'm so sorry.

635
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:45,993
I never wanted you to get hurt.

636
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:50,965
I always looked out for you.

637
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:54,742
I looked out for you!

638
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:14,495
We can't let them know
we're watching them.

639
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:20,400
They hate us, Henry. I heard them say it.
You have to protect me.

640
01:12:20,569 --> 01:12:22,537
That's my hiding place, dude.

641
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:26,072
Sorry to spoil your plans, Bobby.

642
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:28,369
- You're dead, man! You're fuckin' dead!
- Henry!

643
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:30,705
- Stop it!
- Henry!

644
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:34,145
What are you doing?
Look out!

645
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:02,139
Please, Henry.

646
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:09,114
I can make this right.

647
01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:31,529
Oh, shit.

648
01:13:38,213 --> 01:13:40,147
What time is it, Tami?

649
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:43,978
It's... It's a little after 1:00.

650
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:45,780
Thanks.

651
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:13,040
Hey.

652
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:15,640
Hey.

653
01:14:16,985 --> 01:14:19,010
What are you doing?

654
01:14:19,154 --> 01:14:21,520
Just taking care of some garbage.

655
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:26,255
At 3:00 a. M?

656
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:28,886
I don't feel much like sleeping.

657
01:14:33,335 --> 01:14:34,825
We need to talk.

658
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:37,837
We do need to talk.

659
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:40,407
I know what happened to Henry.

660
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,206
I don't think you do.

661
01:14:43,345 --> 01:14:45,313
I do, Travis.

662
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:49,406
I know about the camping trip...
Lori and Bobby.

663
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:52,816
- Been talking to Greg, huh?
- And Sarah.

664
01:14:54,056 --> 01:14:55,580
I know everything.

665
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:58,455
Not everything.

666
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,964
Look, this is it.

667
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:07,691
If you can't open up
to me right now,

668
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:10,031
then I'm leaving.

669
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:13,005
I need to know why
you're so angry with me,

670
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:16,167
why you won't talk
to me anymore.

671
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:18,575
I wanna know everything.

672
01:15:27,322 --> 01:15:29,256
You gonna get that?

673
01:15:33,562 --> 01:15:34,961
Hello?

674
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:40,701
No, he's not with us.

675
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:42,827
Okay, hang on.

676
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:47,707
Have you seen Greg?
Sarah hasn't seen him all night.

677
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:52,041
I'm sure he's around.

678
01:15:56,919 --> 01:15:59,479
No, he hasn't seen him either.

679
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:02,283
Okay, call us back.

680
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:08,496
She's pretty freaked out.
He never does this.

681
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:11,428
Well, you never know
what people are gonna do.

682
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:15,433
What does that mean?

683
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:18,369
It means you should never make the mistake
of giving someone your trust,

684
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:23,240
your heart, because you never know
what they're gonna do with it.

685
01:16:23,378 --> 01:16:25,812
Why are you being like this?

686
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:31,650
Will you please tell me what's wrong?
I can't help you if you don't tell me.

687
01:16:31,787 --> 01:16:35,382
Lorraine, there's so much wrong
I wouldn't even know where to begin.

688
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:37,492
Please just let me know
what's going on.

689
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:41,426
What kind of a fucking idiot
do you think I am?

690
01:16:42,564 --> 01:16:44,327
I don't know what you mean.

691
01:16:44,466 --> 01:16:48,163
- Oh, please, Lori.
- Lori?

692
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:51,966
You're really scaring me, Travis.

693
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:57,005
You say you know everything.

694
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:00,639
You know where my dad is?

695
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:05,786
You said you don't know
where he is.

696
01:17:05,921 --> 01:17:08,685
He left when you were little.

697
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:12,920
That's right.
He left when I was little.

698
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:16,553
Left us, left the state.

699
01:17:16,698 --> 01:17:20,031
Well, now he's
on death row in Texas.

700
01:17:20,168 --> 01:17:22,398
He murdered two women.

701
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,531
I have the same...

702
01:17:27,676 --> 01:17:29,871
problem that he has.

703
01:17:30,012 --> 01:17:31,877
We see things that
aren't there sometimes.

704
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:35,142
And the trouble is I don't always know
when it's happening.

705
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:42,146
So I thought maybe you and Greg weren't
fucking each other behind my back.

706
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:44,724
I tried really hard
to believe that, Lorraine.

707
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:47,385
But then he kept shoving it
right in my face.

708
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:49,861
You think Greg and I...

709
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:53,092
I'm never gonna
get away from this.

710
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:56,466
I know that now.
It's inside me.

711
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:03,206
Did you do something to Greg?

712
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,614
Did I do something to Greg?

713
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:12,585
Greg did something to me!

714
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:17,157
Did you hurt him?

715
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:21,955
You really care about him,
don't you?

716
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:26,534
Good. I want you to.

717
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:31,464
What did you do?

718
01:18:31,606 --> 01:18:33,699
You really wanna know?

719
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:39,074
Oh, God.
What did you do?

720
01:18:42,517 --> 01:18:44,508
See for yourself.

721
01:18:51,693 --> 01:18:54,059
Oh, my God.

722
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:58,265
You're wrong, Travis.
We didn't do anything.

723
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:01,863
I swear, there was
nothing going on.

724
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:05,530
It doesn't even matter
what's real now, Lorraine.

725
01:19:05,674 --> 01:19:08,040
I have to do this.

726
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:11,577
He wants me to.
I owe him that.

727
01:21:26,448 --> 01:21:28,541
I love you.

728
01:21:29,818 --> 01:21:32,378
My baby boy.

729
01:22:48,063 --> 01:22:51,226
- It's easier to take down my ass.
- It is.

730
01:22:58,873 --> 01:23:03,674
- Why don't you pack the tent?
- Why? I wanna stay here with you.

731
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:05,939
You all set?

732
01:23:07,048 --> 01:23:08,982
Did you have fun?

733
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:12,851
I don't mean to beat
a dead horse,

734
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:15,422
but you know we can't tell
Mom and Alan about this, right?

735
01:23:15,557 --> 01:23:19,152
Can I see? What, you don't want me
to look at them?

736
01:23:19,294 --> 01:23:21,660
He won't let you.
He's got volumes of those pads.

737
01:23:21,796 --> 01:23:23,730
He won't even let me
look at 'em.

738
01:23:23,898 --> 01:23:26,833
If you change your mind,
I'd love to see them.

739
01:23:39,814 --> 01:23:42,647
Oh, shit.

740
01:23:42,784 --> 01:23:44,979
I'm in trouble, Henry.

741
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:49,056
This is so messed up. You weren't
supposed to be back till tomorrow.

742
01:23:49,224 --> 01:23:53,285
- Well, that's not the point, Travis.
- That is the point!

743
01:23:53,428 --> 01:23:55,862
If you came back tomorrow,
you wouldn't know that we went camping

744
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:57,692
and you wouldn't be upset.

745
01:23:57,832 --> 01:24:00,426
We would have just had a good time
and everything would be fine.

746
01:24:00,568 --> 01:24:02,502
Well, everything wouldn't be fine.

747
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:04,831
You still did something
very irresponsible.

748
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:09,000
You should know better than to have him
around a bunch of drunk college kids.

749
01:24:09,144 --> 01:24:11,908
We weren't drunk.
We had a couple of beers.

750
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:14,572
I'm frickin' 23 years old.
What's the big deal?

751
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:18,345
Why don't you act like an adult once
in a while instead of a fuckin' baby?

752
01:24:18,486 --> 01:24:20,351
I don't know if
I could trust you now.

753
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:23,013
Have I ever messed up
before? Ever?

754
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:26,184
I don't know. I don't know what you've been
doing behind my back.

755
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:29,455
This is about you not doing
what your mom and I asked.

756
01:24:29,597 --> 01:24:32,691
- This is between Mom and me, Alan, okay?
- Hey!

757
01:24:32,834 --> 01:24:35,166
I live in this house now too, pal.

758
01:24:35,303 --> 01:24:37,737
Well, I can't do anything about that,
can I, asshole?

759
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:41,569
You better start showing me a little respect.
I'm only gonna put up with so much!

760
01:24:41,709 --> 01:24:44,109
Now look, I'll talk to him, Alan, all right?
I'll talk to him.

761
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:46,076
Please.

762
01:24:46,214 --> 01:24:48,910
Yeah, see what good that does.

763
01:25:23,751 --> 01:25:25,343
Hey.

764
01:25:33,528 --> 01:25:36,122
Your brother's really
getting it out there.

765
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:42,396
Some people got it coming.

766
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:45,132
Right?

767
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:58,717
You know, we're never
gonna make it as a family

768
01:25:58,853 --> 01:26:02,186
if you guys don't respect me
and listen to what I say.

769
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:10,188
Sometimes...

770
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:13,164
I think it's too late
for him and me.

771
01:26:15,203 --> 01:26:17,467
But you're different.

772
01:26:20,742 --> 01:26:23,142
I know you don't say much,

773
01:26:23,278 --> 01:26:25,212
but I can see it in your eyes.

774
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:31,315
We have a connection.
Don't we?

775
01:26:33,788 --> 01:26:36,052
An understanding.

776
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:45,690
I can work with you, Henry.

777
01:26:46,834 --> 01:26:49,302
Maybe you'll turn out all right.

778
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:55,634
You can go.

779
01:27:17,565 --> 01:27:20,864
Go get the phone, will you?
It's in the garage on the workbench.

780
01:27:39,387 --> 01:27:41,048
Thanks.

781
01:27:42,023 --> 01:27:43,615
Hey, Henry.

782
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,387
Hey.

783
01:27:49,564 --> 01:27:51,156
You know her?

784
01:28:00,174 --> 01:28:04,076
Hey, it's me.
You coming over or what?

785
01:28:04,212 --> 01:28:06,271
No, it's no big deal.

786
01:28:06,414 --> 01:28:09,281
He doesn't have to know then.

787
01:28:09,417 --> 01:28:12,909
She doesn't have to know.

788
01:28:13,054 --> 01:28:16,114
I just wanna talk to you
for a little bit about some stuff.

789
01:28:17,592 --> 01:28:19,219
Okay.

790
01:28:20,528 --> 01:28:22,462
She's coming over.

791
01:28:29,671 --> 01:28:31,605
Come on in.

792
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:36,902
Hey. What are you doing here?

793
01:28:37,045 --> 01:28:38,979
Lori told me you called her.

794
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:40,546
Yeah. So?

795
01:28:40,682 --> 01:28:44,812
- You gotta stop, man.
- Stop what, being Lori's friend?

796
01:28:44,952 --> 01:28:47,079
If that's why you're here,
you can leave now.

797
01:28:47,221 --> 01:28:50,019
I'm not leaving
until we talk about this.

798
01:28:52,193 --> 01:28:54,423
So that's it?

799
01:28:54,562 --> 01:28:56,427
He has to wash the car?

800
01:28:56,564 --> 01:28:59,089
Now he's having friends over
and everything's back to normal?

801
01:28:59,233 --> 01:29:03,135
I'm getting really tired of you questioning
the way I handle my own kids.

802
01:29:03,271 --> 01:29:05,967
You don't handle them.

803
01:29:06,107 --> 01:29:08,337
You don't even understand them.

804
01:29:10,878 --> 01:29:15,178
Travis wanted to go party with his friends and
his fucked-up brother was holding him back.

805
01:29:15,316 --> 01:29:18,046
So he dragged him in the woods
with a bunch of drunk college kids.

806
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:22,282
- That's your interpretation.
- No, it's the goddamn truth!

807
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:26,385
And you're doing
nothing about it.

808
01:29:32,433 --> 01:29:35,368
Henry is not a normal kid.

809
01:29:35,536 --> 01:29:38,096
You can't treat him that way.

810
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:41,504
You do, and he's gonna snap,
just like his old man.

811
01:29:42,577 --> 01:29:44,442
You should be quiet now.

812
01:29:44,579 --> 01:29:46,911
Lori's not comfortable
being friends right now.

813
01:29:47,982 --> 01:29:49,711
I'll believe that
when she tells me.

814
01:29:49,851 --> 01:29:52,183
What do you think I'm doing here?
You think I'm a mind reader?

815
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,982
She asked me to come
talk to you, Travis.

816
01:29:55,123 --> 01:29:57,648
He sits there all day
watching horror movies

817
01:29:57,792 --> 01:30:00,784
and making all those
fucked-up pictures!

818
01:30:00,928 --> 01:30:04,329
To normal kids,
Henry is a freak.

819
01:30:04,499 --> 01:30:07,696
Don't you ever call him that!

820
01:30:07,835 --> 01:30:10,133
You lost one family.

821
01:30:10,271 --> 01:30:13,035
I'm giving you a second chance.

822
01:30:13,174 --> 01:30:15,199
You gonna blow it again?

823
01:30:15,343 --> 01:30:16,833
Fuck you.

824
01:30:16,978 --> 01:30:19,538
No, fuck you, Alan!

825
01:30:20,615 --> 01:30:23,743
So, what?
You think I'm obsessed with Lori?

826
01:30:23,885 --> 01:30:25,910
You think I'm a stalker
or something?

827
01:30:26,053 --> 01:30:27,816
- If the shoe fits.
- Fuck you!

828
01:30:27,955 --> 01:30:31,254
I'm just telling you the truth.
That's how you're coming across.

829
01:30:31,392 --> 01:30:33,860
You're creeping her out.

830
01:30:34,028 --> 01:30:35,962
Do we have an understanding?

831
01:30:38,666 --> 01:30:41,226
You think I don't hear
what you guys are saying?

832
01:30:41,369 --> 01:30:43,667
What are you talking about?

833
01:30:46,507 --> 01:30:49,442
I know what
you're trying to do to me.

834
01:30:49,577 --> 01:30:52,375
Well, why don't you do it, Bobby?
See what happens.

835
01:30:52,513 --> 01:30:56,916
I don't know what the hell you're talking about,
but do we have an understanding or not?

836
01:30:57,051 --> 01:30:59,178
No, we don't.

837
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:02,016
Now get the fuck
out of my house!

838
01:31:19,207 --> 01:31:21,607
Henry, help!

839
01:31:34,222 --> 01:31:36,986
Yeah, well, why can't
you take care of it?

840
01:31:37,124 --> 01:31:40,491
Because I have something called a job, Kim.
You should look into it.

841
01:31:40,628 --> 01:31:43,859
All right, I'll take care
of it when I get home.

842
01:31:54,141 --> 01:31:55,733
Hey.

843
01:31:59,146 --> 01:32:01,137
Can I see, huh?

844
01:32:03,417 --> 01:32:05,385
Oh.

845
01:32:05,553 --> 01:32:08,317
Alan took off to go cool down.

846
01:32:09,757 --> 01:32:12,624
He actually put his beer down
and admitted

847
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:15,092
that he shouldn't argue
when he's drinking.

848
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:21,267
I think I might have been right
about this one.

849
01:32:21,435 --> 01:32:24,165
There could just be
a decent guy in there.

850
01:32:27,942 --> 01:32:31,742
Are Travis and Bobby
still in his room?

851
01:32:37,118 --> 01:32:39,177
It's really quiet in there.

852
01:33:30,605 --> 01:33:33,073
I know you've had
a tough time so far,

853
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:36,937
but that doesn't mean you guys
can't be happy from now on.

854
01:33:38,245 --> 01:33:41,703
<i>I love you so much</i>.
