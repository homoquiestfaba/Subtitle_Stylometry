1
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,659
Hello.

2
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,509
My name is Mona Screamalot

3
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,066
and welcome to my family movie night.

4
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:21,683
This is my pet grandpa, Oats.

5
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,603
This is my puppy, Shrimp.

6
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,229
This is my asshole druggie brother

7
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,049
and the rest of my druggie family,

8
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,905
my poor fucking grandma.

9
00:02:35,594 --> 00:02:36,863
Ew, Grandpa!

10
00:02:38,603 --> 00:02:41,839
And me and my crazy family
have plenty of things

11
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,593
lined up for you in our
Trashy Treasure Chest.

12
00:02:52,374 --> 00:02:56,541
And look, they're in
glorious HD, high defecation.

13
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,999
All right, one of my
favorite Christmas stories.

14
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,584
This little tidbit of terror

15
00:03:02,585 --> 00:03:04,335
is called "Trendish".

16
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,073
Put it in, Grandpa.

17
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:16,919
Man, oh man, today's the day.

18
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,078
I've waited and it's finally here.

19
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:22,139
The new Bank Money Double C video dropped.

20
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,449
That hat is gonna make me

21
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,933
the coolest kid in high school, finally.

22
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,603
Mom, dad, it's the best day ever.

23
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,259
What, did you sprout your first pubes?

24
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,260
Good one.

25
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,229
No, not yet, but the new Big Money

26
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,939
Double Z video dropped.

27
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,578
Can't wait to see that great new hat.

28
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:45,839
That's nice.

29
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,969
Hey, how about if he get outta here?

30
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,023
We're busy, can't you see?

31
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,239
Okay, well I'm out of this, pop Stan.

32
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,740
I'm gonna go watch that video.

33
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,461
Buzz off, numb nuts.

34
00:03:57,462 --> 00:03:59,715
Kid drives me fucking crazy, you know?

35
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:01,129
It's like, he sucks the
life out of me, you know?

36
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,083
Here, here, there you go.

37
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,909
What the fuck is with this kid?

38
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,679
I don't know.

39
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,739
I wish I understood
him, but I really don't.

40
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,519
These goddamn teenagers these days.

41
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,908
I'm so sick of all these trends.

42
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:36,559
Jesus Christ, why can't he
be more like his brother?

43
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,989
It's so much easier with Kyle.

44
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,499
He just wants what is easy and simple.

45
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,019
Nothing complicated about him.

46
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,602
Yeah, but the only problem is

47
00:04:46,603 --> 00:04:51,189
that he is a serious DVD
hoarder and you know it.

48
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,719
I love my DVD's, my sanctuary!

49
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,959
My kingdom of DVD's!

50
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,946
I have everyone, I have
everything, all of them

51
00:04:59,947 --> 00:05:01,543
but I still need more!

52
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,909
It's here, it's here.

53
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,599
The new Big Money Double Z.

54
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,739
I gotta see this new video

55
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,129
to see that great new hat.

56
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,130

That hat is glorious.

80
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,389
Think I know what I want for Christmas.

81
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,793
Wait, not want, need.

82
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,543
Oh, that new hat, I've
never seen anything like it.

83
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:31,179
Mom, that hat is unbelievable.

84
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,899
Better than I could have ever dreamed.

85
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,439
I need it for Christmas.

86
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,199
Do you think we are made of money?

87
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,429
I can't get you every little
thing that your heart desires.

88
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,408
I'm sorry, we just can't
afford all that junk.

89
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:47,649
But you get Kyle anything
that he ever wants.

90
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,590
Oh, come on.

91
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:52,099
I don't wanna go on and
on about this stupid hat.

92
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,239
Get over it!

93
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,399
But I need to know that I'm
gonna get it for Christmas.

94
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,408
I need to know that I'm
finally gonna be cool.

95
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:01,819
Oh, a come on, stupid hat
isn't gonna make you cool.

96
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,279
No, you don't seem to get it.

97
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,196
This hat makes anyone cool.

98
00:07:05,197 --> 00:07:07,999
Ask Big Money Double Z, he'll tell ya.

99
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,225
Get that your Double Z, number one, hat,

100
00:07:11,226 --> 00:07:13,869
big money, whatever out of here.

101
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,749
Tell your father about it.

102
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,323
You just don't get it, mom.

103
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,046
Dad.

104
00:07:22,047 --> 00:07:23,529
What the hell do you want?

105
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,029
I'm busy, can't you see me working?

106
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,549
Dad, dad, mom just told me to tell you,

107
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,309
I need that hat for Christmas.

108
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,399
She won't listen.

109
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,437
I think you'll get it, you'll understand.

110
00:07:33,438 --> 00:07:37,559
Goddammit, can't you
see me working here?

111
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,026
You're always asking for
some needy, needy, needy.

112
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,809
"I need this, I want this."

113
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,082
People in hell want a cold drink?

114
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,829
I'm so tired of hearing about this hat.

115
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,663
What?

116
00:07:51,664 --> 00:07:54,279
You know, you're an ass hat.

117
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,769
But I need the hat.

118
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,979
If I don't get the hat, I
don't know what I might do.

119
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,219
Oh, I'm shaking in my boots.

120
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,976
Why don't you get the fuck outta here,.

121
00:08:03,977 --> 00:08:05,549
"I need this, I want this."

122
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,609
I'm tired of it.

123
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,689
Get the out fuck out.

124
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,113
I don't wanna hear any more
about that goddamned hat.

125
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,489
They just don't understand.

126
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,423
I need it, to be cool.

127
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,430
Tired of being lame.

128
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:25,930
Hey Kyle.

129
00:08:29,244 --> 00:08:30,137
What do you want?

130
00:08:30,138 --> 00:08:32,589
I'm trying to look at my DVDs here.

131
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,219
Look, Kyle, can you please just try

132
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,079
and convince mom and dad that I need

133
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,219
the new Big Money Double Z hat.

134
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,009
It's the only way I'm ever gonna be cool.

135
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,369
I'll see what I can do.

136
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,439
I've got really important things
to do in here with my DVDs.

137
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,519
Like look at my DVDs,
like categorize my DVDs,

138
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,699
like review my DVDs, like kiss my DVDs,

139
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,799
like masturbate to my DVDs.

140
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,593
And maybe even try and fuck my DVDs.

141
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,319
Too much information.

142
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,659
Just please do.

143
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,999
You have everything you
could ever dream about.

144
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,349
Every DVD.

145
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,939
And this is all I really
need for Christmas.

146
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,863
Just convince them somehow, anyhow.

147
00:09:13,454 --> 00:09:16,089
Oh yeah, whatever, okay?

148
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,016
Oh, just a little lube

149
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:22,663
and I can finally lose
my virginity to a DVD.

150
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,480
I can't wait.

151
00:09:59,728 --> 00:10:02,739
Look at that, a glue gun.

152
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,029
Okay, boys, it's time
to open your gifts.

153
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,179
Mom, dad, can I open mine first, please?

154
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,619
Okay, if it's okay with
Kyle, then you can go first.

155
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,683
Sure, it's Christmas, go ahead.

156
00:10:20,749 --> 00:10:21,999
I can't wait.

157
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:32,719
Well, we know you
wanted a hat really bad.

158
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,453
So there you go, there's a hat.

159
00:10:36,853 --> 00:10:39,229
This wasn't the hat I wanted.

160
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,629
This isn't it.

161
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:44,029
You made a mistake, you
must've made a mistake here.

162
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,500
This isn't it.

163
00:10:45,501 --> 00:10:47,829
This isn't gonna make me cool.

164
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,054
It's a hat.

165
00:10:49,055 --> 00:10:51,067
A hat is a hat.

166
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,823
And besides, the one you
wanted was too pricey for us.

167
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,637
Thanks, mom and dad, just what I wanted.

168
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:13,539
But Kyle, over there, he
gets everything he wants.

169
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,503
He got everything he wanted this year.

170
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:18,239
It doesn't make any sense.

171
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,079
Well, Kyle is a straight C student.

172
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,193
He deserved those DVD's.

173
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,530
Well, I should be just
as a part of this family.

174
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
This isn't right.

175
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,113
You'll be sorry.

176
00:11:33,489 --> 00:11:34,771
What's with him?

177
00:11:34,772 --> 00:11:36,169
What's his problem?

178
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,432
We got him the stupid hat.
Yeah.

179
00:11:37,433 --> 00:11:39,279
And what's with that damn shirt?

180
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,399
He wears it every day.

181
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,639
Oh, Christ, it looks like
somebody threw up on it.

182
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,473
No, he made it...

183
00:11:43,473 --> 00:11:44,456
What, did he make it in arts and craft?

184
00:11:44,457 --> 00:11:46,053
He made it himself.

185
00:11:46,054 --> 00:11:47,571
With that hippy dippy art teacher?

186
00:11:47,572 --> 00:11:48,589
He thinks his gonna make them

187
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,336
and sell them on Ebay or something.

188
00:11:50,337 --> 00:11:52,499
He has to ask for the extra rubber bands

189
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,289
from all the family
members for the fucking...

190
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,632
I don't want one, I hope
he doesn't make me one,

191
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,993
I don't need either.

192
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,890
Well, at least I got my DVD's.

193
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,213
Jerk material for me.

194
00:12:13,172 --> 00:12:14,729
You know, I really thought

195
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:15,899
they were gonna come
through for me this year.

196
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,169
But I guess not, yet again.

197
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,069
Kyle gets his way and I get nothing.

198
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,483
They foiled me again.

199
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,819
This will not do, this won't do at all.

200
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,309
Kyle is the perfect son for them,

201
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:32,139
but somehow I just get shafted every year.

202
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,009
Well, they're gonna regret it this year.

203
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,143
I tell you what.

204
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,339
I'm gonna do something
unforgivable this year

205
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,689
for their presents

206
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,333
because they didn't come
through for me yet again.

207
00:12:45,158 --> 00:12:46,739
You know, I really feel bad.

208
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,589
He really wanted that hat, honey.

209
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,699
We should have gotten him that hat.

210
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,519
Wasn't that big of a deal.

211
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,799
It was expensive.

212
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,849
We couldn't afford that hat.

213
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:59,599
On top of all those
goddamn DVD's for Kyle.

214
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,449
He just has to have them.

215
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,639
So, you know, somebody has to suffer.

216
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,959
So it had to be him.

217
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,739
And he always gets
the bad end of the deal.

218
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,243
Oh well, that's how it is.

219
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,829
This will not do, not again.

220
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,409
This will not do.

221
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,509
This will not do at all.

222
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,419
Every year that tubby
bastard gets everything.

223
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,219
Every DVD he wants.

224
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,619
I, everything he wants.

225
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,599
I don't get one thing I need.

226
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,659
I need this to be cool,
without it I'm lame!

227
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,489
And after tonight,

228
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,919
I'm never gonna be lame again

229
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,113
because what I do, it's
gonna fix them good.

230
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,439
Hey, mom and dad.

231
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,129
Your favorite son is here, you know?

232
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,399
The one who got exactly what he wanted

233
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,529
for Christmas this year.

234
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,479
What the hell do you want?

235
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,663
Jesus, I just got to sleep.

236
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,799
Mother and father.

237
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,499
You didn't get me what I
wanted for this Christmas.

238
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,889
So you know what your present from me is?

239
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,723
Death!

240
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:13,592
The sweet release of death, you die.

241
00:14:13,593 --> 00:14:14,426
No!

242
00:14:14,426 --> 00:14:15,259
No!

243
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:16,259
No!

244
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:18,541
Oh, no!

245
00:14:22,538 --> 00:14:25,109
Where did I put that damn anal lube?

246
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,933
I need to try and do it with my discs.

247
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,653
Hello, brother.

248
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,989
Are you all right?

249
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,899
What happened?

250
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,458
They didn't get me what I wanted.

251
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:44,289
I just wanted to be cool.

252
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,769
What did you do?

253
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,579
They never cared about me.

254
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,549
They never thought anything of me.

255
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,469
It was always about you,

256
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,511
Kyle this, Kyle that,

257
00:14:53,512 --> 00:14:56,799
Kyle, Kyle, Kyle, Kyle!

258
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,406
Oh my God.

259
00:14:58,407 --> 00:15:00,503
What did you do to mom and dad?

260
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,629
Oh, you know, cut them up.

261
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,869
A little dicing and a little slicing.

262
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,119
And I'm gonna do the same to you, Kyle.

263
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,243
Forgive me, father for I have sinned.

264
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,489
Shalom.

265
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,349
DVD, Blu-ray Trading Stop?

266
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,706
Well, let's just say I
got a whole mess of DVD's

267
00:15:30,707 --> 00:15:33,343
and Blu-rays to trade in for y'all today.

268
00:15:34,406 --> 00:15:36,073
I'll see you later.

269
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:41,637
Oh man, with all that moolah,

270
00:15:41,638 --> 00:15:45,029
I'm gonna be able to afford
every hat I've ever wanted.

271
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:49,177
I'm gonna be the coolest
guy around.

272
00:16:00,549 --> 00:16:03,009
Well, I would have wanted a
barrel of acid for Christmas,

273
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:06,863
easier to dispose of your
parents' stinking corpses after.

274
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:15,899
And this blasphemous bowel
movement is "Baby Cakes."

275
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,445
Put it in, grandpa.

276
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:27,982
Things just really got out of control.

277
00:16:27,983 --> 00:16:29,719
I mean, he's a good baby and all,

278
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,588
it's just the things
he's been doing lately.

279
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:33,999
They don't make sense.

280
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,275
What she's trying to say is

281
00:16:35,276 --> 00:16:38,279
he just can't be left alone
with people he doesn't know.

282
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,092
That's why we brought you here.

283
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:41,099
You know, we heard a lot of good things

284
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,169
about you online or on television.

285
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,109
And you are a master
when it comes to putting

286
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,889
ill-mannered babies and
children in their place.

287
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,529
Well, listen, you know,

288
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,109
I'm gonna need a bigger picture.

289
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,962
If you could just kind of
flesh out a little bit,

290
00:16:53,963 --> 00:16:57,319
the little babies behaviors

291
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,053
so I can get a more tactile
sense of what's happening here.

292
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,068
Well, I don't even know where to start.

293
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,139
He only seems to eat
the female babysitters

294
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,117
and kill the male...

295
00:17:10,118 --> 00:17:12,076
Knock it off.

296
00:17:12,077 --> 00:17:14,241
What she's trying to say
is he's only a bad baby

297
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,693
when he's left alone with
people he doesn't know.

298
00:17:18,766 --> 00:17:20,443
I see, I see.

299
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,893
All right, here's what we'll do.

300
00:17:26,874 --> 00:17:28,719
Now tell me the incident.

301
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,529
And I want you to describe the incident

302
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:33,493
that led you to call me
at 2:00 AM in the morning.

303
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,819
Well, yesterday Buddy and I went out

304
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,769
for a nice candle lit dinner.

305
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,549
So I hired the next door neighbor, Sam

306
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,313
to come over for a few hours.

307
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:47,359
Thanks so much, Sam for agreeing
and babysitting Baby Cakes.

308
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,919
Buddy and I rarely get to go out.

309
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,359
Now remember, Sam do not go in that room

310
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,849
under any circumstances if you
hear any noises whatsoever.

311
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,683
All right?

312
00:17:56,684 --> 00:17:58,399
We have him under heavy sedation.

313
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,999
A big plane can crash down
this motherfucker right now.

314
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,609
And he won't wake up, you understand me?

315
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,499
Okay, but I've been your
neighbor for like two years now

316
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,349
and I still don't know what
little Baby Cakes looks like.

317
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,449
Well, let's just say

318
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,009
he doesn't like the outdoors that much.

319
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,439
And he's very malnutritioned

320
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,519
so we don't like taking him anywhere.

321
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,379
Well, the doctor's say he's special,

322
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,559
but anyways, we gotta go.

323
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,349
We're running late, we
gotta get to the restaurant.

324
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,949
I'm hungry as hell.

325
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,399
Just call us if you need us.

326
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,689
Right on Mr. Driscoll.

327
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,743
Don't worry, I'll make
sure he's safe and sound.

328
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,849
Oh yeah, I almost forgot.

329
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,969
Baby Cakes has been having
very bad diarrhea lately.

330
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,379
So if the air smells like shit,

331
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,849
just spray a little bit of air freshener.

332
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,950
When we get back, we'll change his diaper.

333
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,210
Bobby, Bobby, come here.

334
00:18:58,211 --> 00:18:59,993
I wanna see this thing already.

335
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,449
Did you see the baby yet?

336
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,149
Did you see the baby?

337
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,889
Relax. Relax, relax.

338
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:06,723
Why?

339
00:19:06,723 --> 00:19:07,556
Take your time.

340
00:19:07,557 --> 00:19:08,689
No, no, no, no, no.

341
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,269
I got the camera here.

342
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,829
You're we gonna be rich and famous.

343
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,099
We're gonna be all the national news.

344
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,309
We'll have hookers, sluts, Jacuzzi's.

345
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,159
We're gonna be famous.

346
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,829
We have all the time
in the world for drugs.

347
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:19,830
We only have a little bit of time

348
00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:21,330
until their parents come back.

349
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,370
Okay, let me get the camera.

350
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:28,569
Holy fuck!

351
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,072
The stories and rumors I
heard were true all along.

352
00:19:31,073 --> 00:19:32,629
Oh my God.

353
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,769
Did you know this thing
ate two babysitters before?

354
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,019
Two females, just gobbled them right up!

355
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,020
Have I heard what?

356
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,830
Okay, let's get this thing started.

357
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,166
Oh God.

358
00:20:30,546 --> 00:20:31,546
Get away.

359
00:20:53,973 --> 00:20:57,249
So Roy, you see, that's what
we came home to last night,

360
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,899
which was the final straw.

361
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,889
And I know you can help
us with little Baby Cakes

362
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,824
and his anger problems
towards the babysitters.

363
00:21:03,825 --> 00:21:07,879
Tell me, what did you
do with these bodies?

364
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,749
Well, we just stuffed
them in garbage bags

365
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,000
and threw them on their
family's front porch.

366
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,239
Okay, I think I've heard enough.

367
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,493
Let me see this baby of yours.

368
00:21:40,312 --> 00:21:41,469
Baby.

369
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,283
There's my piggy.

370
00:21:44,235 --> 00:21:45,235
Hi.

371
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,639
See what I mean?

372
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,883
He loves us, but he hates strangers.

373
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,299
Well, don't worry about it

374
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,919
after all that is my job,

375
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,873
taming these little bastards.

376
00:22:20,862 --> 00:22:22,445
You little, animal!

377
00:22:24,275 --> 00:22:27,189
You motherfucking piece of baby shit!

378
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:31,263
I am going to show you
who is boss around here.

379
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,269
Do you understand?

380
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,119
Do you understand?

381
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,194
You don't even speak English,

382
00:22:38,195 --> 00:22:42,084
you silly little infant of shit.

383
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,990
This is gonna be a bit more
difficult that I imagined.

384
00:22:52,616 --> 00:22:55,229
I'm gonna need you to leave me alone.

385
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,369
Finish your cookie.

386
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,979
No, no, thank you.

387
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,980
Leave.

388
00:22:59,844 --> 00:23:02,735
I'm gonna work a little magic.

389
00:23:02,736 --> 00:23:06,721
No, thank you.

390
00:23:06,722 --> 00:23:08,074
No, thank you.

391
00:23:08,075 --> 00:23:09,415
Goodbye.

392
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:14,416
Mr. Rumpeldickskin wants to play.

393
00:23:19,379 --> 00:23:24,379
Do you like it when Mr.
Rumpledickskin plays with you?

394
00:23:25,198 --> 00:23:27,703
Wants to play with you?

395
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,630
Baby, baby!

396
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:37,340
Get, get over here, you little baby!

397
00:23:37,341 --> 00:23:39,188
Get, get over here now!

398
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:54,973
Screw it.

399
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:59,789
That is the worst baby
I have ever dealt with

400
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:04,169
in my entire career of baby training.

401
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,609
Screw it.

402
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,769
You're getting her all flustered.

403
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,359
You're not gonna leave us, are you?

404
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,342
Because you know, Baby Cakes
needs some training here

405
00:24:11,343 --> 00:24:13,899
and you're the only professional we know.

406
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:18,433
Long before I was a
celebrity baby nanny guru,

407
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:25,370
I did some time in
Southeast Asia as a preacher

408
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:29,099
and I did some exorcisms there.

409
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,909
I think there are dark
forces at work here.

410
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:37,719
That thing in there is an
absolute cauldron of evil.

411
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,243
So I think we're gonna have
to perform an exorcism.

412
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,190
You don't think are baby's
possessed by demons, do you?

413
00:24:46,191 --> 00:24:47,379
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

414
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,389
You used to be an exorcist preacher?

415
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,669
Why did you stop?

416
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:53,679
Well, I was fired selling
dope in a nun's outfit.

417
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,250
That is immaterial.

418
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,306
You sure this is gonna work?

419
00:25:00,307 --> 00:25:02,059
No, it should.

420
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:07,060
Just remember, he who doth
tamper with the forces of nature

421
00:25:09,084 --> 00:25:12,605
open the door to disaster.

422
00:25:24,455 --> 00:25:26,376
What was that?

423
00:25:26,377 --> 00:25:27,549
Just a little saying

424
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,039
we used to say at the Brotherhood
of the Foreign Exorcism.

425
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,040
No biggie.

426
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:38,563
Let's see.

427
00:26:15,778 --> 00:26:16,611
You know what?

428
00:26:16,612 --> 00:26:20,048
I may have chanted the
wrong phrase in Latin.

429
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:25,049
So I may have just invited
Satan into his vessel.

430
00:26:27,108 --> 00:26:28,608
Yes, I am Satan.

431
00:26:29,947 --> 00:26:33,202
Come to me, come here, come here.

432
00:26:33,203 --> 00:26:34,734
Come here, come here.

433
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:45,089
Who's gonna change my diaper?

434
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,585
I'm covered in shit.

435
00:26:47,586 --> 00:26:49,101
Come to me.

436
00:26:49,102 --> 00:26:50,420
Come here.

437
00:26:50,421 --> 00:26:52,530
Hey, hey, hey.

438
00:26:52,531 --> 00:26:54,114
Let me the fuck in!

439
00:26:55,844 --> 00:26:57,832
Who's gonna change my diaper?

440
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:59,626
I have a big old shit.

441
00:26:59,627 --> 00:27:01,544
Now let me the fuck in!

442
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,149
Thanks Mr. Roy.

443
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,989
You've done everything we hoped you'd do.

444
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:14,223
All the years of practicing Satanism.

445
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:19,393
What the hell, are you talking about?

446
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:23,106
We brought you here because
of your exorcism powers.

447
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,459
Now me, Buddy and Satan's Baby Cakes

448
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,539
will take over the world

449
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,013
and everyone will bow down to us.

450
00:27:45,725 --> 00:27:47,313
Fuck me!

451
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,559
All right, well "Baby Cakes" is done.

452
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,089
Don't you love when the Satan
worshipers win in the end?

453
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,839
I do, it brings a tear to my brown eye.

454
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,613
All right, I'll do the next one.

455
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,329
Oh, "Bloody Hell."

456
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,953
We're watching "Bloody Hell".

457
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,689
What's this place like, Jake?

458
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:00,259
Well, it's a
little hard to get through,

459
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,219
but we got a little over 200 acres.

460
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,163
So perfect to camp.

461
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,220
Are we there yet?

462
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,873
No, about maybe 40 more miles.

463
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,563
Max, get your damn dog off me.

464
00:29:40,401 --> 00:29:45,234
Why don't you pay more attention
to that fleabag of yours?

465
00:29:47,216 --> 00:29:49,339
You really think it was a good idea

466
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,459
to bring that dog along?

467
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,283
Of course, she's the
best oil tracker around.

468
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,179
I need you guys to wait right here

469
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,389
while I take a look around.

470
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:24,239
I just gotta make sure that
we're on the right property.

471
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,240
All right?

472
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:28,969
While I'm gone, can you
guys unload the stuff?

473
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:29,970
Yeah.

474
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,330
I won't be long.

475
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,043
We'll get the stuff.

476
00:30:59,044 --> 00:31:00,263
We'll get the stuff, okay?

477
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,350
I'm back.

478
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:02,529
Yeah, we're on the right property.

479
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,645
I'll help you with that.

480
00:32:04,646 --> 00:32:05,479
Where did Max go?

481
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,730
He went to take a leak.

482
00:32:07,856 --> 00:32:09,456
Did he bring his dog with him?

483
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:11,863
I think.

484
00:32:11,864 --> 00:32:12,899
Yeah.

485
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,900
It's messed up.

486
00:32:17,941 --> 00:32:20,139
Okay, we'll be able to start prospecting

487
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,295
for some oil!

488
00:32:21,296 --> 00:32:22,296
Woo!

489
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,095
I think that's all of it.

490
00:32:25,096 --> 00:32:26,333
Okay.

491
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,868
Let's go.

492
00:32:28,868 --> 00:32:29,701
Okay.

493
00:32:29,701 --> 00:32:30,701
Yo, Max!

494
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:45,079
This should be far enough.

495
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,149
Emily, you dropped the shovel.

496
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,359
Go out there, and pitch a tent.

497
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,293
Thanks, see you in a bit.

498
00:32:54,967 --> 00:32:58,403
We should be up there
in about two hours.

499
00:32:59,836 --> 00:33:01,872
Thanks.

500
00:33:01,873 --> 00:33:02,873
Great.

501
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,373
It looks like a good
spot to start digging, men.

502
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,652
Oh, my hands are freezing.

503
00:33:15,653 --> 00:33:17,924
My hands are also freezing.

504
00:33:17,925 --> 00:33:19,063
All right.

505
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:26,669
And if you wanna take a break you can.

506
00:33:29,794 --> 00:33:32,442
Okay, Jeff, let's start.

507
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,800
Oh, sorry.

508
00:34:09,112 --> 00:34:11,069
Did you hear something?

509
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,820
No, just a feeling.

510
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,339
Max, can you get the oil rods ready?

511
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,270
We're getting deep.

512
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,270
Yeah.

513
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,920
Pretty soon, the filtration will kick in.

514
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,269
Hurry, we've implanted the oil rod.

515
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,820
What about the reinforcement?

516
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,902
We've got to pack this in, all right?

517
00:34:49,862 --> 00:34:52,109
Tomorrow, we'll try and
transplant the stuff.

518
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:56,123
The oil out of the ground, into our bags.

519
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:00,193
Hope Emily's got some nice
big supper ready for us.

520
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,670
Your idiot, sister.

521
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,619
I don't even know why
we brought her along.

522
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,109
Jake, Max, we had better
head back to the tent.

523
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:11,069
It's gonna be dark soon.

524
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,807
All right

525
00:35:12,808 --> 00:35:16,968
Let's do that.

526
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,865
Hey, Jeff.

527
00:36:09,866 --> 00:36:10,971
What?

528
00:36:10,972 --> 00:36:12,826
I think I heard
something out there.

529
00:36:12,827 --> 00:36:14,417
Can you check it out?

530
00:36:14,418 --> 00:36:16,430
Yeah.

531
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,750
Jake?

532
00:36:51,439 --> 00:36:52,539
Yeah?

533
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,593
Shine your light.

534
00:37:09,249 --> 00:37:10,582
What time is it?

535
00:37:15,074 --> 00:37:16,074
2:30.

536
00:37:19,449 --> 00:37:20,616
Where's Emily?

537
00:37:39,398 --> 00:37:40,481
Get out, run!

538
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:34,009
No, no, no!

539
00:45:33,371 --> 00:45:35,883
Oh, what a happy ending.

540
00:45:35,884 --> 00:45:38,793
That morbidly obese bowser
lost weight the easy way.

541
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,599
And this next one is "The Prom."

542
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,189
Starring Don and Murph.

543
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,393
Good find, Oats.

544
00:46:24,169 --> 00:46:25,352
Mail for me!

545
00:46:25,353 --> 00:46:26,353
Mail for me!

546
00:46:36,926 --> 00:46:38,199
Murph, Murph, we got a letter, a letter.

547
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,059
Our very first letter.

548
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:43,489
No, Don, you mean our second letter?

549
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:45,099
Don't you remember the first one we got?

550
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,098
You know, the one from the Mormon.

551
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:49,889
Murph, I don't know
what you're talking about.

552
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,729
I forget things within hours.

553
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:53,919
Sometimes within minutes.

554
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,379
Oh Don, that's fine.

555
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,923
Some people remember
things better than others.

556
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:00,010
What?

557
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,473
Don, may I please see the letter?

558
00:47:04,426 --> 00:47:06,176
What letter, Murph?

559
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:22,329
What's it say, what's it say Murph?

560
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:23,330
What's it say?

561
00:47:24,153 --> 00:47:26,139
It says dear Don and Murph,

562
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,609
we are pleased to inform you

563
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:29,339
that you have been invited to

564
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,394
a special prom just for you

565
00:47:31,395 --> 00:47:33,319
for an award ceremony

566
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,279
for all of the reviews that you've done

567
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,069
over the last few years,

568
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:42,073
the award ceremony will be held
at Saskatchewan university.

569
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:45,020
Wow, Murph!

570
00:47:45,021 --> 00:47:48,023
What are we gonna wear to
such an auspicious occasion?

571
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,799
I don't know.

572
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,879
It should be something elegant yet snazzy,

573
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,023
but not too formal at the same time.

574
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:01,903
Let's just ask my parents, Murph.

575
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:07,039
Mom, dad, me and Murph got
invited to a prom just for us!

576
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,590
What should we wear to such
an auspicious occasion?

577
00:48:11,258 --> 00:48:12,293
Oh, Don.

578
00:48:13,594 --> 00:48:15,763
Auspicious, what the fuck it that?

579
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:17,919
Prom?

580
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,719
Who gives a shit, you fat fuck.

581
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,979
Why don't you go to Omar the tent maker?

582
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,419
See if he's got a a tent to fit your ass.

583
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,069
That skinny bean pole,

584
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,539
he can go as a goddamn pole.

585
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,846
I don't know, Don, don't ask me.

586
00:48:31,847 --> 00:48:34,439
And don't ask me for any more money.

587
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,129
I just spent the last of my money

588
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:39,739
on my special shake making magic bullet.

589
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,929
So don't ask me for anything.

590
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:44,773
Oh, come on, come on,
we need something, please.

591
00:48:46,221 --> 00:48:48,489
Well, you know, on second thought,

592
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:50,619
I think there's a tarp in the basement

593
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,369
that I use to cover the car over

594
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:54,419
when we went on trips.

595
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:57,479
We could maybe make that fit your fat ass.

596
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,139
That gives me a good idea.

597
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,120
Why don't you get out

598
00:49:00,121 --> 00:49:02,819
our old graduation gowns and wear them?

599
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:05,699
That would be a perfect
thing to wear to the prom.

600
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,399
Yeah, yeah, he could wear those.

601
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,340
I don't know though.

602
00:49:08,341 --> 00:49:09,469
I don't think there's a hell,

603
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:10,999
I don't think they're big enough.

604
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,859
Maybe get down to the church
and get the whole church choir.

605
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:17,574
And sow them all together, that'd work.

606
00:51:38,658 --> 00:51:39,658
Don!

607
00:51:40,925 --> 00:51:43,698
This is a little strange.

608
00:51:43,699 --> 00:51:45,930
I think I'm gonna walk around the halls

609
00:51:45,931 --> 00:51:49,460
and see if there's anyone else around.

610
00:51:49,461 --> 00:51:51,794
Okay, Murph, have your fun.

611
00:51:51,795 --> 00:51:53,995
But come back soon.

612
00:53:32,745 --> 00:53:35,328
Oh no, I have to take a shit!

613
00:54:28,592 --> 00:54:31,660
Ah, someone's in here pooping.

614
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:41,389
Well, everyone, what a showdown.

615
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:43,066
If only my prom were like that.

616
00:55:43,067 --> 00:55:45,199
The only action I saw

617
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,449
was a bunch of baby
fetuses in the toilets.

618
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:50,039
Good times.

619
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,613
Onto the next one, "Caged Girl."

620
00:57:12,097 --> 00:57:14,513
That's the girl of my dreams down there.

621
00:57:15,351 --> 00:57:17,443
I want so bad to be with her.

622
00:57:19,557 --> 00:57:22,163
But she'd never go for a guy like me.

623
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:25,610
But she will be mine.

624
00:59:28,907 --> 00:59:30,490
What's happening?

625
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:42,662
Oh no, no, it's okay.

626
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:43,495
Don't be afraid.

627
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:47,339
You see, I'm your new boyfriend?

628
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:50,139
Boyfriend, I don't know who the you are.

629
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:52,733
So let me out of here
before I bite your dick off.

630
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:55,649
You're not going anyway.

631
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:57,769
You're mine now.

632
00:59:57,770 --> 01:00:00,493
And I'm gonna do do
whatever I want with you.

633
01:00:01,332 --> 01:00:03,489
If you don't let me out of
here my father will kill you.

634
01:00:03,490 --> 01:00:04,884
He knows karate.

635
01:00:10,018 --> 01:00:11,018
Karate?

636
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,633
I ain't afraid of that shit.

637
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:22,619
I'm going to bed, I'll see you tomorrow.

638
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:27,620
When I see you tomorrow, you
better be a better girlfriend.

639
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:31,983
Otherwise I don't even wanna say

640
01:00:31,984 --> 01:00:34,187
because I'm a good Christian.

641
01:01:01,884 --> 01:01:05,628
I should make the Dame some breakfast.

642
01:01:05,629 --> 01:01:09,229
Yeah, and something
that'll make her smile.

643
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:11,427
Make her allegiance tinkle.

644
01:02:14,908 --> 01:02:17,573
Young one, young one.

645
01:02:17,574 --> 01:02:20,319
Awaken from your dream state.

646
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,553
I brought you something to munch on.

647
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:54,813
All that did was turn me on.

648
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:11,469
You bitch.

649
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:14,009
You stupid bitch.

650
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:17,029
Just for that, you
don't get any more food.

651
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:20,399
You don't get any bathroom,
or any shower or anything.

652
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,833
You're gonna piss yourself for all I care.

653
01:03:35,081 --> 01:03:37,623
That bitch, that stupid bitch.

654
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:40,789
She doesn't like me.

655
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:42,736
I'm gonna make her like me.

656
01:03:42,737 --> 01:03:44,806
I'm gonna make her like me.

657
01:03:44,807 --> 01:03:45,640
You know what?

658
01:03:45,641 --> 01:03:46,973
I'm just gonna...

659
01:03:58,830 --> 01:04:01,529
All right, here's how it's gonna be.

660
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:06,199
If you want privileges,
you have to treat me right.

661
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:10,163
You have to treat me
like a real boyfriend.

662
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:12,579
That's it.

663
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:14,159
That's it, that's all you gotta do.

664
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:18,273
All you gotta do is treat
me like you really love me.

665
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:20,729
Can you do that?

666
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:22,797
Cause if not, then forget about it.

667
01:04:39,536 --> 01:04:40,819
Hello.

668
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:43,703
Yeah, hey, Mr Peterson,
Patterson, I'm sorry.

669
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:45,919
It's been a busy day.

670
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,039
This is the office of Hanson
and Sons, the realtors.

671
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,030
We just wanted to make sure

672
01:04:50,031 --> 01:04:52,019
everything's working
out with your new house

673
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:54,799
because we care here at Hanson and Sons.

674
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:55,640
This is what I do.

675
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:58,949
I follow up on all my
business transactions

676
01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:03,950
because I look forward
to a long relationship

677
01:05:04,172 --> 01:05:09,172
in the real estate realm
and continuing the business

678
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:10,600
of our relationship,

679
01:05:10,601 --> 01:05:12,813
it's just absolutely tantamount.

680
01:05:14,219 --> 01:05:15,692
Oh, the house is great.

681
01:05:15,693 --> 01:05:19,403
But I can't overlook the fact
that my daughters missing.

682
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:21,849
Yeah.

683
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:25,009
Yeah, I'm really concerned
about that, but you know

684
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:27,749
let me, let me just tell
you one father do another.

685
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:29,648
Don't worry, she'll be back.

686
01:05:29,649 --> 01:05:30,989
Girls will be girls,

687
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:32,639
plus they're all little bitches

688
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,189
and little fucking sluts anyway.

689
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:36,589
Just probably out sucking
neighbors dog's dick.

690
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:37,590
Little whore.

691
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:41,889
Goodbye, Mr. Peterson, it
was nice talking to you.

692
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:43,423
Just remember, you can always call

693
01:05:43,424 --> 01:05:47,633
the offices of Hanson and
Sons where we deeply care.

694
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,739
Hey there.

695
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:09,929
So, how you doing?

696
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:12,289
Oh, I'm doing fine.

697
01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:13,443
How about you?

698
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,609
I'm fine.

699
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:21,279
So, are you ready to get physical now?

700
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:26,280
You know when I put my male
thing in your female thing?

701
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:27,883
You know?

702
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:33,980
Oh no, I smell down there, like fish.

703
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:39,070
I haven't had a shower in days
and my clothes are filthy.

704
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:43,029
Oh no, don't worry about it.

705
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:45,269
Smells like that don't bother me.

706
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:48,919
I love fish.

707
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:51,919
Oh, well it bothers me quite much.

708
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,089
I want our first time to be special.

709
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:55,536
Something erotic, something you see

710
01:06:55,537 --> 01:06:58,669
on one of those movies
on TV, late at night.

711
01:06:58,670 --> 01:07:00,926
I don't wanna smell terrible for you.

712
01:07:00,927 --> 01:07:03,023
You'll always remember that.

713
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:07,823
All right, I guess that
makes sense in a way.

714
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:11,883
I really do love that smell.

715
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:15,309
So listen, I have an idea.

716
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:16,719
How about this?

717
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,889
You let me go upstairs
and let me take a shower.

718
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:21,759
Of course, you lock me in

719
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,499
and while you lock me in the shower

720
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,639
and I'm, you know, cleaning everything.

721
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:30,049
You go to the store and pick
me up some new accessories

722
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:32,889
for females and some new clothes.

723
01:07:32,890 --> 01:07:33,890
How about it?

724
01:07:34,931 --> 01:07:36,579
Huh?

725
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:37,919
That sounds fine to me.

726
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:38,920
Let's go.

727
01:08:58,505 --> 01:09:01,505
There you go, that's what I got you.

728
01:09:32,032 --> 01:09:36,468
So, you're all washed
up, no more fish smell.

729
01:09:36,469 --> 01:09:40,888
Nice, squeaky clean, new
clothes, feminine accessories.

730
01:09:40,889 --> 01:09:43,659
You're ready to get physical now?

731
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:44,983
Oh, I can't.

732
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:48,879
Why not?

733
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,249
I've done everything for you

734
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:52,818
and given you everything you've asked for.

735
01:09:52,819 --> 01:09:54,112
What else could there be?

736
01:09:55,889 --> 01:09:58,919
Well, I was thinking
about you in the shower

737
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:02,593
and I was feeling myself,
if you know what I mean?

738
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:08,243
Well, I'm not really sure, but continue.

739
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:12,740
What I'm saying is, I'm
all dried up and prunish.

740
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,723
All right, I'm gonna go in
my room and play with myself.

741
01:10:21,702 --> 01:10:22,702
I was so ready.

742
01:10:29,495 --> 01:10:31,245
I must dream tonight.

743
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,979
Hey, baby, you ready now?

744
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:02,713
Oh boy, I'm ready.

745
01:11:20,829 --> 01:11:24,459
Oh, you're making me so horny.

746
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:27,027
Oh, you're making me so wet.

747
01:11:28,321 --> 01:11:33,321
Oh baby, oh baby.

748
01:11:36,253 --> 01:11:40,213
Oh, you don't know what
you're doing to me.

749
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:50,240
Over here.

750
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:57,209
Kiss me, baby, kiss me.

751
01:12:12,430 --> 01:12:16,263
Gazooks, truly one of
my all time favorites.

752
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:21,303
That hottie had all the men after her.

753
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:25,749
I'm surprised you all managed
to stick around in one piece.

754
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:27,849
Well, this next one will definitely

755
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:29,793
leave a bad taste in your mouth.

756
01:12:30,969 --> 01:12:32,362
It's "A Pain In The Gums."

757
01:13:32,846 --> 01:13:36,096
What the hell is wrong with my mouth?

758
01:13:51,457 --> 01:13:53,540
Hello, Evan!

759
01:13:56,761 --> 01:13:57,761
Hello?

760
01:13:58,585 --> 01:14:01,335
I said hello, dummy!

761
01:14:03,202 --> 01:14:04,535
I said, hello.

762
01:14:05,645 --> 01:14:06,975
Well, my name's Beth.

763
01:14:06,976 --> 01:14:09,662
And I'm the bacteria inside of your mouth.

764
01:14:09,663 --> 01:14:10,949
And I don't have any place to go

765
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:14,673
so I'm gonna stay here and
eat out your gum, okay?

766
01:14:16,198 --> 01:14:17,365
In my mouth?

767
01:14:18,213 --> 01:14:20,816
I must have accidentally
ingested some LSD or something

768
01:14:20,817 --> 01:14:23,921
because this is not possible.

769
01:14:23,922 --> 01:14:26,968
Well, it certainly
is not an hallucination.

770
01:14:26,969 --> 01:14:28,652
Well, then what the hell is it?

771
01:14:28,653 --> 01:14:30,178
Where are you?

772
01:14:30,179 --> 01:14:32,399
I'm the bacteria that's living inside

773
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,852
your dirty water from last night.

774
01:14:35,853 --> 01:14:38,299
The water from the sink?

775
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:40,663
Oh, am I so calling my landlord.

776
01:14:41,639 --> 01:14:43,203
Don't be so drastic.

777
01:14:43,204 --> 01:14:46,410
As long as you keep me
fed, you'll be good.

778
01:14:46,411 --> 01:14:47,994
Look, look, look.

779
01:14:48,869 --> 01:14:50,119
I'm gonna humor you,

780
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:52,999
even though I think I'm
really loosing it right now.

781
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,723
I've gotta be out of my mind.

782
01:14:54,724 --> 01:14:57,089
Listen, this is gonna be a problem for me

783
01:14:57,090 --> 01:15:00,009
because I've got a really
important interview

784
01:15:00,010 --> 01:15:02,009
and I can't have you murmuring

785
01:15:02,010 --> 01:15:03,949
inside of my head the whole time.

786
01:15:03,950 --> 01:15:05,718
You're giving me a headache.

787
01:15:05,719 --> 01:15:07,779
You're just gonna
have to get used of me

788
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:09,773
because I'm not going anyway baby.

789
01:15:11,099 --> 01:15:12,738
That breakfast burrito was pretty good

790
01:15:12,739 --> 01:15:15,378
but next time, don't use anymore chilli.

791
01:15:15,379 --> 01:15:17,349
That ruins everything.

792
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:18,899
Shut up!

793
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:21,343
Jesus Christ, I'm talking to my mouth.

794
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:24,399
I'm really loosing it this time.

795
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,665
You're really loosing it this time.

796
01:15:26,666 --> 01:15:30,813
You're fucking batshit crazy.

797
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:34,403
Gotta get it together.

798
01:15:34,404 --> 01:15:36,379
Get it together, get it together.

799
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:38,769
You are not helping.

800
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:40,819
Just be quiet.

801
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:43,943
This interview is very important to me.

802
01:15:45,751 --> 01:15:47,519
Jobs are for losers.

803
01:15:54,561 --> 01:15:58,039
To our
next on the chopping block.

804
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:59,040
Hi.

805
01:16:00,370 --> 01:16:01,869
Hey, how are you sir?

806
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:04,119
Oh, Mr. Paisley.

807
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,879
Oh, it seems, you've been unemployed

808
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,709
for the last four years.

809
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:13,710
Well, yeah, but I've been
doing a lot of volunteer work

810
01:16:16,509 --> 01:16:17,983
and I babysit a lot.

811
01:16:19,324 --> 01:16:23,489
Well, that makes up for
a fun-filled four years.

812
01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:25,699
I've always kind of, you know,

813
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:28,109
wanted to be in broadcasting.

814
01:16:28,110 --> 01:16:29,819
Shut the up fuck up!

815
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:30,888
Excuse me?

816
01:16:30,889 --> 01:16:32,040
Who are you talking to?

817
01:16:33,288 --> 01:16:35,023
Who was I talking to?

818
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:37,993
Oh, nobody.

819
01:16:37,994 --> 01:16:39,819
I wasn't talking to anybody.

820
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:41,243
Shut the fuck up!

821
01:16:42,567 --> 01:16:44,293
Did you just tell me
to shut the fuck up?

822
01:16:44,294 --> 01:16:46,609
No, no, no, I didn't.

823
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:49,279
I didn't say, I didn't say anything.

824
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:52,689
No, go, go on, you were saying.

825
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:54,218
Well, my father's been
running this company

826
01:16:54,219 --> 01:16:56,053
for the last 22 years.

827
01:16:57,389 --> 01:16:59,599
Okay, you know what you
ungrateful piece of trash?

828
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,913
Get the hell out of my office.

829
01:17:00,914 --> 01:17:02,746
Have a nice day!

830
01:17:03,809 --> 01:17:05,243
Fuck my life!

831
01:17:06,271 --> 01:17:07,103
What a fucking nut job.

832
01:17:07,104 --> 01:17:09,449
I'd never hire anyone
with those work ethics.

833
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:11,753
Time to get back to business.

834
01:17:14,248 --> 01:17:17,392
Step inside, you're
letting all the flies out.

835
01:17:17,393 --> 01:17:19,504
Shut up!

836
01:17:19,505 --> 01:17:20,385
You gotta eat.

837
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:21,848
I don't wanna eat.

838
01:17:21,849 --> 01:17:23,760
You got to hell!

839
01:17:23,761 --> 01:17:25,676
You can't starve me.

840
01:17:25,677 --> 01:17:27,832
If I don't get rid of you now

841
01:17:27,833 --> 01:17:30,196
I'm gonna starve you until you die.

842
01:17:30,197 --> 01:17:33,908
I'm gonna fucking spit you
back out into the sink.

843
01:17:33,909 --> 01:17:35,674
You fucking bitch!

844
01:17:35,675 --> 01:17:37,028
Hurry up and feed me.

845
01:17:37,029 --> 01:17:40,140
I don't wanna feed you, leave me alone.

846
01:17:40,141 --> 01:17:41,141
No!

847
01:17:42,781 --> 01:17:43,781
Okay fine!

848
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:46,858
That's it, I've had it!

849
01:18:01,263 --> 01:18:03,013
I can still hear you!

850
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:13,387
Goddammit, that's it,
I'm gonna fuck you up!

851
01:18:45,764 --> 01:18:46,764
Fuck you!

852
01:19:01,934 --> 01:19:04,934
It's time to bring out the big guns.

853
01:19:16,552 --> 01:19:19,094
Fine, do whatever you want.

854
01:19:53,809 --> 01:19:56,689
Oh, how I love talking gum diseases.

855
01:19:56,690 --> 01:20:00,119
Just last week, I had
a periodontal disease

856
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:01,943
in a Gingivitis milkshake.

857
01:20:03,737 --> 01:20:05,520
I wanna watch another movie.

858
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,718
So sad, it's all done.

859
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:11,169
The show is all over.

860
01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:13,637
We have to get going to our second job.

861
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:30,303
Let's get the fuck outta here.
