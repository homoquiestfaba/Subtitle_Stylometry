2
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:28,232
To the mind that is still the whole universe surrenders - Lao Tzu

3
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:34,990
The unexamined life is not worth living - Socrates

4
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:45,840
You can not solve a problem from the same level of consciousness that created it - Albert Einstein

5
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:55,267
There is more to life than increasing its speed - Mahatma Gandhi

6
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:04,965
For thousands of years mankind has searched the world for meaning, happiness and contentment.

7
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,215
We've looked at the stars.

8
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,585
We've dug into the past.

9
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,664
We've turned to science.

10
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:21,077
We've looked for it in each other, and we've looked for it in our toys.

11
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:25,006
but still for most of us the search has been unfulfilled.

12
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,193
The key to happiness has remained elusive.

13
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:40,327
No matter who we are or what we do, most of us feel we're held back by something.

14
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:45,467
Whether it's stress or self doubt, anxiety, depression or addiction.

15
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,406
Financial worries or health concerns.

16
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:53,759
Negative feelings about our bodies, our relationships, our past experiences.

17
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:57,590
This all is based on belief that we are separate.

18
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:01,559
Which creates a feeling that we're not enough as we are.

19
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,506
We need something more to feel whole.

20
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:11,734
We need more money, more power, more drama, more drugs, more food.

21
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:17,466
We believe that we need to consume the world in order to be.

22
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:25,238
And that feeling that I’m not enough as I am is incredibly detrimental to our lives, and this Earth we share.

23
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:35,298
But what if we could actually stop the madness. Live in this moment.

24
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,322
And let go of our limitations.

25
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:45,875
What if you had a tool that could simply, quickly, easily and effectively transform your life.

26
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,061
It's not about changing who you are.

27
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:52,418
It's about letting go of the things that appear to be in the way.

28
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:00,721
Letting Go.

29
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,620
Right now the world is at critical turning point.

30
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:13,127
If we continue to do what we've done up until this point.

31
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:17,284
We'll continue to get results, that none of us are happy with.

32
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:20,615
But it doesn't have to be this way.

33
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:26,826
All over the world people like you, and me, are waking up to the truth of who we are.

34
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,124
And this film is one of those ways.

35
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:34,960
It's a way for you to have love and peace and joy in your life.

36
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:40,057
And it's a way for us all to work together to bring about a better world.

37
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:50,999
When I found this method I said: This is amazing, because anybody can experience,

38
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:55,290
what I now know people try to achieve over their whole lifetime.

39
00:03:55,485 --> 00:04:00,100
It didn't take me hours of meditation, relaxation, sitting somewhere

40
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:04,082
to get in a state of peace.

41
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,344
It allowed me to finally come to some peace.

42
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,365
I'm so fortunate .... to be free,

43
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,003
to be free.

44
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:17,346
It just feels great to not worry anymore.

45
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:19,027
That's what SEDONA method gives you.

46
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,279
The freedom to let life be as it is.

47
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,570
It changed my life.

48
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,940
Are you feeling overburdened by your life?

49
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,434
Do you feel like you have a little excess baggage?

50
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:33,122
Are you ready to let go?

51
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,890
I think it's time.

52
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:40,673
The SEDONA method is made up of a group of very simple and powerful tools.

53
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,842
And one of this tools is called welcoming.

54
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:46,733
Welcome - to greet or receive in a polite or friendly way.

55
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:51,434
To let go of the need to control or possess something.

56
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:57,315
In other words, what welcoming is, is simply allowing whatever your feeling to be in this moment.

57
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,539
But that's not what we usually do.

58
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,000
What we usually do is we usually push life away.

59
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,786
We hold our feelings back.

60
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:07,314
And when we do that they bow us over.

61
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,744
But if we do what's counter intuitive.

62
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:13,368
If we just simply open and allow our feelings to flow.

63
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:18,795
They pass right through us, and there's no place for them to stick.

64
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:24,086
And we'll be exploring a very specific
3 part process we call Triple Welcoming.

65
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,008
So let's explore it together.

66
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:32,892
Step one is welcoming the issue: the thoughts, the feelings, the beliefs, the memories,

67
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,049
Anything that's holding you back.

68
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:38,815
Step 2 is welcoming all your wanting to do something with it.

69
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,067
your wanting to fix it, you wanting to change it,

70
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:45,363
you wanting to control it, wanting to hold it close, or push it away,

71
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,187
Any attachment or aversion.

72
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:51,206
And step 3 is welcoming any sense that it's personal.

73
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:54,060
That it's about you, or who you are.

74
00:05:55,272 --> 00:06:01,272
When you welcome any sense that it's personal, you find that whole thing naturally dissolves.

75
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:08,000
I welcomed  all the feelings, all the sensations that comes with it.

76
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,402
I bring it all out. I feel like I trick it.

77
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,435
I trick all those into a little boat, that I have visioned.

78
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,992
And all of a sudden, all of the feeling are in there,

79
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,946
I just said Bye, Bye,  and they're gone.

80
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,692
Now lets explore triple welcoming together.

81
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:32,554
As you do releasing, know that you can do it with eyes open or eyes closed.

82
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:33,910
Both are effective.

83
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,625
And as you do releasing, as you let go  as you welcome what is,

84
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:41,382
Allow yourself to lead with your heart,

85
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,839
As opposed to your head.

86
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:48,596
Now allow yourself to think of a situation in your life,

87
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,768
that you've been wanting to change or improve.

88
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:57,018
Something with your relationships, something with your health,

89
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,842
Something with your money. Or something with the world.

90
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:06,110
And as you focus on this situation, could you allow yourself

91
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:11,867
to simply welcome, whatever thoughts, whatever feelings,

92
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:19,040
Whatever beliefs, anything at all associated with that particular issue.

93
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:25,031
Could you just simply open, and welcome, as best you can.

94
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:32,000
And could you also allow yourself to welcome any wanting to fix it,

95
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:35,586
Any wanting to change it, any wanting to improve it,

96
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,589
Any wanting to do anything at all with it.

97
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,526
any wanting to push it away, or hold it close.

98
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,239
any sense of attachment or aversion.

99
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,029
And remember, just simply do this inside.

100
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,720
Just simply open and relax, and welcome.

101
00:07:57,186 --> 00:08:02,119
And could you also allow yourself to welcome, any sense, that it's personal.

102
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,316
That it's about you or who you are.

103
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,802
Any sense of identity.

104
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,805
Again remember, just do this inside.

105
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,885
And then could you just simply, Let Go.

106
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,819
you discover the treasure of who you are.

107
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,985
It's like you open the box and the treasure is here.

108
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:32,542
It has always been here, and it's an endless treasure.

109
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:36,688
there's no limit to the richness of it. And you feel like,

110
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:41,618
wow, you know, that's such a gift.

111
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,127
One of the best ways to learn releasing or letting go,

112
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,951
is by sharing the experience with others.

113
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,342
As you watch others going through this process.

114
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:56,766
It invites you gently, but powerfully, into your own experience.

115
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,893
Into your own understanding. So the best way to view this film

116
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,584
Is as though you're one of participants.

117
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:08,304
View this as an invitation to get actively involved.

118
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:12,111
Now of course, you can simply watch this film for entertainment.

119
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:16,032
And you'll be entertained, but there's a deeper promise here.

120
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,034
there's something that if you allow yourself,

121
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:21,258
to at least keep an open mind and an open heart,

122
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:27,728
This whole process can engage you at a level that can make a huge difference in your life,

123
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,713
I'm an author of text books,

124
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:35,270
I write, just finished 8th edition of textbook in critical thinking.

125
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:38,847
And I’m a mother, grand mother, and grand grandmother.

126
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:42,138
I followed many paths, had many forms of therapy.

127
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:47,809
When one is releasing it's moving out of the mind and the thought,

128
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:53,164
Often the folly of thinking into direct perceptual experience.

129
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:58,186
It's given me this excitement about finding stuck places in myself.

130
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:03,329
That I hadn't realized were stuck. And having tools for a way through.

131
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,553
Through releasing.

132
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:10,299
We filmed an advanced course in San Francisco,

133
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,840
and then we decided there were so much goodness there

134
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:16,426
that we just had to share it with the world

135
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:21,450
Everyone in this film, including myself, are ordinary people, just like you

136
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:26,181
who had found real lasting happiness, and are living their dreams

137
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:32,127
and they did this by simply using this simple, powerful and easy to learn technique.

138
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,241
That we're about to explore together

139
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:40,244
This film is an invitation for you to discover the truth of who you are

140
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:45,330
To let go of everything inside you, that's holding you back

141
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:49,154
And the key to all of this in my experience is letting go

142
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:54,692
and allowing yourself to be, that what you already are.

143
00:10:55,864 --> 00:11:00,980
I'm a Vietnam veteran, and I was in Vietnam 40 years ago

144
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:04,265
This last year I was diagnosed with PTSD (Post Traumatic Syndrome Disorder)

145
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:08,956
and it made perfect sense that I've been angry for the last 40 years

146
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,689
irritable about what happened in that situation.

147
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:19,580
and I’ve suppressed it with alcohol, antidepressants and going to therapy.

148
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:25,564
nothing has worked to eliminate this irritability and anger that I’ve had inside me

149
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:29,249
about a month ago I stopped drinking I stopped taking anti-depressants

150
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:32,710
and I went to a Vet-Center and I said "I've stopped drinking and...."

151
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:38,467
the counsellor at the Vet Center said "Oh that's good, now you can let the PTSD come up"

152
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:43,263
The good news is that you now recognize that you have the PTSD.

153
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:47,225
He said that the bad news is that it will take another 40 years to heal

154
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:52,049
I don't wanna spend another 40 years having this PTSD or this anger heal

155
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,898
I've already spend 40 years with it.

156
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:58,322
About a month ago I started listening to Hale talk about releasing

157
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,738
and the different releasing methods,

158
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:03,449
and that's what I’ve been doing for the last month.

159
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:08,073
is releasing some of this anger, using some of the method to do that.

160
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:11,220
For me the Sedona Method has been helpful,

161
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:16,032
And what I'd like to say to other Veterans, it's a possibility,

162
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:20,128
it could help, it could help release some of the pain,

163
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:21,949
and anger, that's inside.

164
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,432
Those of you watching or listening at home do this with us,

165
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:30,310
Those of you here if you would pick up a pen or a pencil

166
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:37,000
So for the sake of this analogy, this object represents our unwanted emotions

167
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:41,446
it also represents our unwanted thoughts, our unwanted feelings,

168
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,114
our beliefs about ourselves.

169
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:47,938
and also all the roles, all identities that we've taken on for ourselves

170
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:54,210
And your hand represents your gut if you like, or simply awareness

171
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:58,791
So now take your hand, grip it tightly around the object,

172
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:06,939
now if we did this long enough it will start to feel really uncomfortable

173
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:12,737
and then really familiar, because this is what we do all the time with our emotions

174
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,127
now roll the object around in your hand.

175
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,572
Now is this object attached to your hand?

176
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:25,100
No, obviously not, but if you think about your relationship to your identities

177
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:31,848
and your emotions, we actually talk as though we are them.

178
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,753
When we're angry, what do we usually say?

179
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:40,966
I'm angry, exactly. When we're sad what we usually say: "I’m sad"

180
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:48,246
We actually believe that we are the emotion, that's actually what we believe.

181
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:52,809
Now when we take on this roles, and we take on this feelings as though

182
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:58,033
they are us, we forget that it's something that we're choosing.

183
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:02,152
We're holding on to it ourselves, so we can make a new choice

184
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:06,239
and we can get stuck, even in positive roles, positive identities.

185
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:09,701
but especially I think you can relate to the fact, that we all have all

186
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:15,165
this negative identities about ourselves, and negative beliefs, negative feelings,

187
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:21,000
that we've been doing this for so long, they feel like part of us

188
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:24,924
we can hardly move, and it’s kinda, we go through life like this,

189
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:29,012
we don't loose anything, you know, we're protecting them too.

190
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:33,703
if we have a particular role that we've identify with we're like this:

191
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,766
don't get anywhere nearer, especially if it hurts.

192
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:41,470
Did you notice what we do when something hurts:

193
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:46,154
we collapse around it, we go ughhhh, and then we're like this:

194
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:48,907
you not gonna get anywhere near my suffering,

195
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:51,951
How dare you even think of taking this away from me.

196
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,775
And that's all unnecessary.

197
00:14:55,562 --> 00:15:04,029
That suffering that we go through, in order to protect our suffering is craziness.

198
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,180
So getting back to this analogy, because this isn't attached to us

199
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:15,141
We have this amazing opportunity to just simply do this:

200
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:20,271
close your hand lightly around this object, by the way please do this at home,

201
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:21,428
and just drop it.

202
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:25,841
Was that hard to do?

203
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,343
NO.

204
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,862
Some of you are giggling because it was so easy.

205
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:35,432
Well that's how easy it could be to let go of even

206
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:45,587
beliefs, identities, feelings that we've absolutely with certainty believed we've always been.

207
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:50,635
Beliefs about ourselves, or feelings that we've thought we never ever could let go of.

208
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:54,859
Could be let go of that easily by simply deciding to let it go.

209
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:59,956
The person we're about to see is dealing with issues that we all face.

210
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,827
We're all playing roles that no longer serve us.

211
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,965
they are holding us back.

212
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,849
And this is a way to be free of all roles.

213
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:12,053
And to choose to be your authentic self.

214
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:19,523
I always felt this incredible responsibility to

215
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:28,280
do well, be excellent,

216
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,589
just to do my very best,

217
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:33,094
to represent (in quotes) "my race".

218
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:34,118
Yes.

219
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:37,844
And then of course being a black male in this country.

220
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:43,540
I've always felt this awesome responsibility to kinda brake this stereotype

221
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:50,400
and I had this moment in November, where I thought to myself

222
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:51,627
Oh, this is great.

223
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,797
And then I had this other moment that went:

224
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:58,358
Oh what's my race on....... now.

225
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:05,456
I don't have to do this anymore. Right.

226
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:16,371
But I’ve always felt this responsibility, you know that I had to be The Representative.

227
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:23,003
or a representative of my race, and be a good one of that.

228
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:24,293
Yes.

229
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:31,178
So ahm, everything I did in my life that revolved around that, you know.

230
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:37,502
And it just feels like really heavy load that I'd like to let down.

231
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:44,642
but at the same time ammm, have some benefit to others.

232
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:45,523
Sure.

233
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:53,033
.......I mean I feel very fortunate I have a wonderful, wonderful wife.

234
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:56,715
I decided to get married for the first time in my life

235
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,233
And she tolerates me.

236
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:08,804
Yes, most wives tolerate us.

237
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,444
So I fell a little bit more tolerable.

238
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:14,601
Yes, yes, great.

239
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:28,983
So in this moment could you just welcome that memory and all the burden that comes with it.

240
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,517
And all the memories,

241
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:42,805
And all the beliefs

242
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,217
And all that pressure

243
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:03,089
And all the desire to fix it or change it, or control it or be free of it

244
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:13,778
Good.

245
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:21,739
And then all the sense that's who you are, that's personal

246
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,857
And then notice what's beyond all that.

247
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,470
So what's actually here now?

248
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:22,871
Does it..... Nothing.

249
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,331
It worked, again, it's working now.

250
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:43,870
So in this moment, do you need to play any role in order to be?

251
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:45,161
No.

252
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:48,789
No.

253
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,585
Isn't that a relief?

254
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:06,665
Thank you, thank you.

255
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:16,711
So I think you can see we all have one or two issues, that we need to deal with

256
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:20,002
But you may be wondering, how did we lose our way

257
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:24,522
If we're already whole and complete and perfect within ourselves

258
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,085
how did we get so confused?

259
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:29,724
Well it's actually quite simple

260
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:34,548
If you allow yourself to simply be open to what we're gonna explore next

261
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:39,071
I think it may ring some bells and open some doors,

262
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,667
and help reveal to you how we got ourselves into this mess.

263
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:49,077
What I'm talking about is just another concept,

264
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:51,768
I'm not saying this is the truth, right.

265
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:55,959
But, in my experience, what happens in the first couple of years of life,

266
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:58,316
the thinking mind is in development

267
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:03,461
and it's a learned behavior to even think that you are your name

268
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:09,241
It looks kinda like this, if that was Laura and this was daddy it would be:

269
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:11,641
Daddy

270
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:12,665
Laura

271
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:13,685
Daddy

272
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:14,709
Laura

273
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:19,774
And if you hear that for about long enough, maybe two years or so,

274
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:23,531
you start to believe you are Laura, or a Paula or a Tony

275
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:27,352
or whatever your particular body mind is called

276
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:29,909
it's a learned behaviour, and it's actually

277
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:32,533
we started describing the body in the third person

278
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:38,914
but in around two or two and a half it goes from

279
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:43,006
Laura’s toy, Hale's toy, or Josephine’s toy

280
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,897
or again whoever we're call.

281
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:46,324
to My toy.

282
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:49,345
and as soon as it becomes my toy,

283
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:52,569
we're willing to defend our toys with our lives,

284
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:55,639
it becomes like, we think it's all about me,

285
00:22:56,418 --> 00:23:00,148
and then we spend the rest of our lives until we get tired of it,

286
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:02,972
what arises with that belief that I’m this

287
00:23:03,634 --> 00:23:06,446
is that everything besides this is a threat

288
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,823
then one of the words that we use a lot is

289
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:10,714
NO, No no , no , no , no, no

290
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:19,479
and as adults we've just gotten perfected our No's

291
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:22,587
and we try to make them very subtle,

292
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:26,078
as you let go and discover the truth of who you are,

293
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:30,448
you don't loose the wisdom gained from experience,

294
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:34,719
but what happens is you loose all that excess baggage

295
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:38,603
that's accumulated around believing that you are just that

296
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:40,827
that separate me, that separate I

297
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,580
That can fall away

298
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:45,860
And it falls away through all different forms of releasing

299
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:50,573
And it falls away very rapidly as you discover it's just a learned behaviour

300
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:53,264
It isn't the truth, it isn't who you are

301
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,569
I was going through difficult times in my life,

302
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:02,973
am in terms of my marriage, and ................

303
00:24:04,695 --> 00:24:08,695
I suddenly realized that the love that I’ve had been seeking

304
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:13,342
outside of myself was actually coming from inside.

305
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:15,970
And it was quiet a revelation.

306
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,523
And it was very much of relief.

307
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:24,643
And at that point I had gotten to knowing the marriage was in a lot of trouble.

308
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,473
And I was very concerned how my children are going to respond.

309
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:34,367
And I still remember what he said to me, I didn't even tell him much of a story.

310
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:36,536
He just looked at me and he said you know:

311
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,960
Could you let go of wanting to control your family's experience.

312
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:47,615
And that I really think was the beginning of what helped me start to release.

313
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:54,347
In our fast pace world, we're all so busy, we're all so plugged in,

314
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:59,353
That we become human doings instead of human beings

315
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:05,192
And that beingness is always right behind all this doingness.

316
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:07,889
And if you allow yourself to discover

317
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:10,624
that you don't need to be so caught up

318
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:12,661
In all the actions in life

319
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:16,480
there's a sense of flow, sense of ease

320
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:20,497
there's a sense of openness, and there's a sense of certainty

321
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:23,454
that reveals itself in action

322
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:26,748
and you can have this right here, right now,

323
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,710
and throughout your day

324
00:25:31,907 --> 00:25:33,259
I can't believe I'm doing this

325
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:35,283
what's that?

326
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:38,223
Most of the people can't believe when there up there

327
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:40,475
It's like, my hand went up and I'm on the stage

328
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:46,166
Oh my god, what did I do?

329
00:25:48,966 --> 00:25:52,278
Yeah, I'm in enough pain that I would like to be out

330
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:54,235
So Pain is a great  motivator

331
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:55,156
Yeah, I guess

332
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,180
Yeah, one of the things that keeps coming up

333
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:01,643
is my career, and what I do for a living

334
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,113
I've devoted a lot of my life to

335
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,773
and then on the very first day, when we did the pen

336
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:15,195
when I was grasping on to the pen it was my career

337
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,659
it was what I do for a living,

338
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:22,987
but it was really tight

339
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:25,228
Yes I can see even in your hand

340
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:27,647
you're a white knuckling it brrrraaaa

341
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:32,071
Don't you take that away from me, don't you even try kind of thing

342
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:39,861
and what's happening is, my body, there's been for the last year, or year and a half

343
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:43,909
my body is not, I don't know what is going on with it.

344
00:26:44,855 --> 00:26:49,388
but it's not letting me have as much energy, to do as much as I have

345
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:58,293
so I'm not able to meet all the demands of my worklife

346
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:02,286
and my way of dealing with that is to push through this

347
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:06,790
Yes, to push right through this, and that's not working

348
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:10,148
and I feel like, I'm really trapped there

349
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:13,105
and here I am in this really expensive space

350
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,400
and I can expand it to so many other

351
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:21,220
but this area I hit I am just holding on

352
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:26,164
I would really like to be released from that Please If you could help me

353
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:27,188
Sure

354
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:33,129
By the way, I just wanna remind you and everyone else that

355
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:38,220
It may appear I'm doing something, but I'm not

356
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:43,368
the releases that happen, the recognitions that happens

357
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:46,922
all that unfolds here has nothing to do with me

358
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,213
So before we even go there, could you just welcome all the energy

359
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,127
that's arising in this moment

360
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:02,831
there's a lot of emotion arising

361
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:07,768
so could you just simply welcome it

362
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:23,327
good

363
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:26,196
and could you just do this inside

364
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:40,347
so in this moment can you actually find the one

365
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:45,296
who thinks they need to work in order to be

366
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:46,161
no

367
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:47,185
right

368
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:50,821
but what is here?

369
00:28:52,024 --> 00:28:56,000
It's a very beautiful space

370
00:28:56,153 --> 00:29:02,000
right, now check, are you separate from that space?

371
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:03,052
no

372
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:04,076
right

373
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:07,770
do you rent that space out at your job?

374
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:13,852
I am not getting any money for it.

375
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:14,879
No.

376
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:20,300
We rent bodies not the space.

377
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:22,906
One of the things that happens, as you do this exploration

378
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:27,730
as you recognize that what you are is that

379
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:29,584
what is changelessly present

380
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:34,937
that starts to become a little more interesting than that what changes

381
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:39,839
the only reason we miss it is because we're more interested

382
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:44,300
we think the juice is in the suffering

383
00:29:44,326 --> 00:29:46,793
We think the juice is in the changing

384
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:50,247
and we believe in it

385
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:56,783
we believe in the changeful

386
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,000
and ignore that what is changeless

387
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:05,169
Yes, there's definitely element of that

388
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:10,000
the glamour, the drama, it feels very compelling

389
00:30:10,227 --> 00:30:15,000
right exactly, and plus what else you're gonna talk about?

390
00:30:15,107 --> 00:30:18,900
Mind also likes to have something to talk about

391
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:25,136
And there's not much to say about what you are

392
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:30,000
It is, beginning, middle, and end of the story

393
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:32,497
and even that's too many words

394
00:30:34,585 --> 00:30:37,052
Cause that what you are is worthless,

395
00:30:38,714 --> 00:30:41,714
is conceptless.

396
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,830
Thank you very much Hale,
Thank you!

397
00:30:51,143 --> 00:30:54,600
As you allow yourself to open to welcoming,

398
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:58,200
what happens is you get a sense of flow

399
00:30:58,275 --> 00:31:02,700
you get a sense of how life simply is happening

400
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:06,634
it's like a river, and it's always flowing through the now

401
00:31:06,658 --> 00:31:10,558
and as you allow yourself to open to the river of life

402
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:13,300
it carries you where you need to go

403
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:16,728
and all those obstacles that you've been creating in your life

404
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:19,397
when you allow yourself to welcome the river

405
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:25,288
it simply flows through, carrying away whatever it is you don't need

406
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:30,000
most of us have a long list of beliefs

407
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:33,453
of what we think we are, what we believe we are

408
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:36,144
what other people told us about ourselves

409
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,863
all these things that you believe about yourself

410
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:43,351
are not actually who you are

411
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:46,466
as you discover that all this things that you learned about yourself

412
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:48,801
all these things that you believe about yourself

413
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:53,600
aren't actually real it's actually a relief

414
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:56,476
now I know that you already invested a lot of time and energy

415
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,395
in that particular identity that you think you are

416
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:02,119
so some of you at first may hesitate

417
00:32:02,214 --> 00:32:07,900
seeing through all that work you invested

418
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:10,520
but what you find as you do this work

419
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:15,522
whatever time and energy and intent you invested

420
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:18,153
in that particular separate identity,

421
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:23,401
as you see through it, as you discover that isn't who you are

422
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:26,000
you'll get it back a million fold

423
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:31,000
because when you confine yourself to any particular identity

424
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:35,685
when you confine yourself to any particular point of view

425
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:41,756
what you discover is that you're murdering or eliminating or cutting of from

426
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:44,804
all other possibilities

427
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:49,556
But what you are right now is unlimited

428
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:54,569
there's nothing you need to do and Nowhere you need to go

429
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:57,433
in order to be that what you already are

430
00:32:58,687 --> 00:33:04,354
I found a way to survive what was very challenging: Depression

431
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:10,351
I found a way to overcome some sabotaging thought patterns and behaviours

432
00:33:10,866 --> 00:33:20,333
And I've had a good grace to be introduced to the nature of my mind

433
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:25,260
and that's something that is priceless

434
00:33:25,631 --> 00:33:29,964
Most of us are carrying deep burdens from the past

435
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:35,444
it could be old losses, old traumas, even abuse

436
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:38,266
and it's such a heavy burden to carry

437
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,955
and the problem that we carry this burdens

438
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:47,646
is that we reexperience these past traumas over and over and over again

439
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:54,986
and the invitation here is as you let go you keep the wisdom that you gain from experience

440
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:58,994
but you get rid of all the pain, all the suffering

441
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:01,017
all the stuff that's preventing you

442
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:03,908
from fully living life and really moving on

443
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:06,314
I realized I had a lot of very difficult memories

444
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:09,805
am that I needed to let go, and I didn't know how to

445
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:14,334
I was experiencing very strong emotions like panic attacks

446
00:34:14,805 --> 00:34:18,576
I found the way to be able to accept my feelings rather than reject them

447
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,867
and when you allow yourself to let go of what was

448
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:27,805
you discover the exquisite beauty of what is

449
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:32,311
When that one person dies slowly

450
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:37,031
And if that one person leaves behind a husband and maybe two daughters

451
00:34:37,578 --> 00:34:41,999
that, I become wracked with pain

452
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:45,765
Sure, so is it here now?

453
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:46,878
It seems to be

454
00:34:47,546 --> 00:34:50,579
Ok, so lets just start with the memory

455
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:55,357
there's all this memories about that whole time period

456
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:56,971
Yes.

457
00:34:57,681 --> 00:35:02,214
And there's also a lot of pain attached to all the memories

458
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:03,436
Yes

459
00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:07,229
But there's also a lot of sweetness

460
00:35:07,524 --> 00:35:10,837
Yes, and sometimes when we have a mixture like that

461
00:35:10,861 --> 00:35:13,798
we think we have to hold on to the whole package

462
00:35:13,822 --> 00:35:18,555
because if we let go of the pain we're afraid we will lose the sweetness

463
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:22,891
I've seen this so often, where we get caught when we're grieving

464
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:26,715
is we believe that the grieve, the suffering and the pain

465
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:30,886
actually connect us to the one that we've lost

466
00:35:30,923 --> 00:35:33,902
this is true when relationship brakes down, or someone dies

467
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:36,593
someone just simply goes out of our life

468
00:35:36,762 --> 00:35:40,617
we are afraid to let go of the pain and the suffering attached to us

469
00:35:40,641 --> 00:35:45,408
to the memories, because we're afraid we will lose the person

470
00:35:45,562 --> 00:35:48,395
or we lose our love for them,

471
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:52,215
but in my experience the opposite is true

472
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:56,049
to the degree we're holding on to the pain or the suffering

473
00:35:56,073 --> 00:35:59,640
we're cutting off from the love that we are

474
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:05,034
so in this moment, let yourself remember your wife

475
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:09,437
and can you feel just a little bit that love that you have for her

476
00:36:09,461 --> 00:36:11,461
Yes

477
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:15,763
and could you just let it shine,

478
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:19,677
and then let it shine into all those memories

479
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,997
it's actually coming from here out and through

480
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:26,412
and if you let it it will start to dissolve all these things that

481
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:29,169
you've been carrying around

482
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:32,752
and you notice that it just gets stronger as It does it

483
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:37,643
as it consumes it at the flame of that love

484
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:42,032
try just one memory that's painful

485
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:46,831
Okay, done

486
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:51,341
and could you just welcome the memory

487
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:58,217
Aha

488
00:36:58,594 --> 00:37:02,794
and then could you also welcome all your wanting to change it

489
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:07,265
all your wanting it to be different to the way that it was

490
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:12,262
and could you also welcome the feeling that it is personal

491
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:13,941
Yes,

492
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:21,002
you came up here wanting to let go something that you've been struggling for 20 Years

493
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:24,624
so now check in this moment, did you loose love

494
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:30,646
or is there a little more love available to you in this moment

495
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:33,419
a little, Yes

496
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:39,246
Yes, OK, so could you just welcome the love

497
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:40,343
Yes

498
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:46,220
and then could you welcome the remaining pain and suffering and memory

499
00:37:46,642 --> 00:37:47,642
yes

500
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:55,835
the love itself if you allow it to will simply wash away all the rest of the memories

501
00:37:55,859 --> 00:38:00,632
you don't have to sort through them, you don't have to remember each one

502
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:03,923
make sure you get every detail, it's not required

503
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:07,717
in this moment, there is this awareness

504
00:38:08,622 --> 00:38:12,268
now the awareness itself is that personal or it just is

505
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:13,228
it is

506
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:14,938
right, and does it have any boundaries

507
00:38:14,962 --> 00:38:15,814
no

508
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:19,238
right, and does it have even a beginning or an end?

509
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:21,861
no

510
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:26,418
right, now was she separate from that?

511
00:38:26,974 --> 00:38:27,974
no

512
00:38:29,101 --> 00:38:33,034
is what you are separate from that?

513
00:38:33,105 --> 00:38:34,105
no

514
00:38:35,065 --> 00:38:37,932
right, so there's no personal center there,

515
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:40,152
was there one in her

516
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:44,547
that I started to realize just a second

517
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:52,939
We live in a highly addicted society

518
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:57,981
most of us have addictions that we don't even realize we have

519
00:38:58,005 --> 00:39:01,738
we can be addicted to food, we can be addicted to drugs,

520
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:03,695
we can be addicted to alcohol

521
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:07,452
but we also get addicted to our stories, to our suffering

522
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:10,557
to whatever it is that's holding us back

523
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:13,442
but there's an invitation to allow yourself

524
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:17,029
to let go of whatever you run on automatic

525
00:39:17,649 --> 00:39:22,582
wherever you become addicted to something besides the truth of who you are

526
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:25,341
and when you let go of addictions,

527
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:30,305
it doesn't mean that you can't enjoy the same things that you were enjoying before

528
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:32,329
but you can do it in a new way

529
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:33,572
free of addiction,

530
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,590
free to do it or not do it

531
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:39,009
and free to discover what's beyond all addiction

532
00:39:41,256 --> 00:39:44,110
So do you have a particular habit in mind?

533
00:39:44,134 --> 00:39:44,986
Yes,

534
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,010
Okay

535
00:39:46,512 --> 00:39:56,912
I habit of using food for comfort, for energy, to calm things down,

536
00:39:58,232 --> 00:40:01,169
to excite things up, pretty much for many reason

537
00:40:01,193 --> 00:40:07,993
right, most of us have all purpose relationship with food

538
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:09,992
no limitation

539
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:13,977
right no limitation, well it's extreme limitation but...

540
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:16,184
yes that's great.

541
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:19,875
well in this moment could you just welcome that memory,

542
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:24,004
see right now are you using food for anything

543
00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:26,236
no

544
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,260
right

545
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:30,336
so could you just welcome that whole memory

546
00:40:30,556 --> 00:40:35,623
of how you used food for many things besides just simply supporting the body

547
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:38,145
yes

548
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:42,331
and could you just welcome the whole memory?

549
00:40:45,112 --> 00:40:46,112
yes

550
00:40:46,613 --> 00:40:53,946
okay, and could you also welcome any feeling of wanting to be controlled by food

551
00:40:57,749 --> 00:40:58,749
yes

552
00:40:59,168 --> 00:41:05,835
OK, good, and could you welcome too any wanting to get rid of the memory, your wanting to change it

553
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:08,092
yes

554
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:16,920
good, and then could you welcome any sense that that's about you or who you are.

555
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,060
Yes

556
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:22,356
Absolutely, yes

557
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:27,834
when we have a lot of memories associated with particular tendency

558
00:41:28,614 --> 00:41:34,814
there is the sense of "all those memories must belong to somebody

559
00:41:35,537 --> 00:41:41,404
right and I think because there is a sensation that arises

560
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:45,594
in you know ...I’ll be sitting here and I feel tired

561
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:49,235
and sensation comes up like "Eat something"

562
00:41:49,259 --> 00:41:50,259
right

563
00:41:51,386 --> 00:41:53,786
everyone's related to this very well

564
00:41:56,433 --> 00:42:00,788
and going through my day working on the computer and get stressed out

565
00:42:00,812 --> 00:42:04,042
it’s actually sensation "eat something", well that's a thought

566
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:06,666
but it kinda arises as bodily sensation

567
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,629
absolutely

568
00:42:07,653 --> 00:42:10,798
and so everytime that happens it reinforces the memory

569
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:13,955
right, but non of that is happening now, right?

570
00:42:15,285 --> 00:42:15,803
right

571
00:42:15,827 --> 00:42:16,721
ok

572
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:22,612
so, that, all those memories could you simply welcome them

573
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:29,799
yes

574
00:42:30,425 --> 00:42:35,958
and then could you welcome the rest of the sense that those memories are who you are

575
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:39,077
Yes

576
00:42:39,101 --> 00:42:43,834
right, could you welcome that sense of having constructed whole identity

577
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:47,415
around your relationship to food

578
00:42:48,902 --> 00:42:49,902
yes

579
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:56,232
now check, do you need that identity to be?

580
00:42:58,453 --> 00:42:59,453
no

581
00:42:59,538 --> 00:43:05,538
so If this arises again just simply notice it and welcome it

582
00:43:07,129 --> 00:43:11,229
notice the sensations notice the sounds in your head

583
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,500
"Oh, time to eat, what can I eat?

584
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,281
what should I eat now?

585
00:43:16,305 --> 00:43:18,838
we all have our favourite right there.

586
00:43:19,183 --> 00:43:20,183
"CHIPS"

587
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:23,277
and the body goes "OK"

588
00:43:30,152 --> 00:43:31,352
"Whatever you say"

589
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:45,108
so, when that comes up, or as that comes up you just let it be there

590
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:48,759
and you may a few more times eat the chips

591
00:43:49,546 --> 00:43:51,733
but if you fight eating the chips you'll just eat more

592
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:54,824
everyone in this room has experienced that too

593
00:43:55,302 --> 00:43:59,235
"Ohh! I am not gonna eat this!"

594
00:44:00,307 --> 00:44:02,107
"Ohh I'm really gonna stop"

595
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:08,311
but if you simply welcome that phenomena, you let it be there

596
00:44:09,066 --> 00:44:14,333
what happens is very quickly it starts to dissolve

597
00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:17,634
and you may go through the pattern few more times

598
00:44:17,658 --> 00:44:19,991
and then it just start to drop away

599
00:44:20,577 --> 00:44:24,777
and be open to the possibility that it will never come up again

600
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:29,667
ok, great, thank you

601
00:44:35,884 --> 00:44:40,817
all of us tend to have this self imposed limitations we've put on ourselves

602
00:44:41,306 --> 00:44:45,639
and this work helps you let go of this limitations

603
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:47,455
and when you put another one on yourself

604
00:44:47,479 --> 00:44:50,250
you could recognize that it's just a story

605
00:44:50,274 --> 00:44:52,074
and, and learn to let it go

606
00:44:52,818 --> 00:44:55,672
once you learn these tools it helps you to become liberated

607
00:44:55,696 --> 00:45:01,296
this really given me some basis stand on that I am here and only here

608
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:04,556
and that the story is gonna play itself out,

609
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,474
I don't have to play it out in my mind

610
00:45:06,498 --> 00:45:10,270
Tried it and did it with my kids 9 year old and 11 year old

611
00:45:10,294 --> 00:45:15,094
Enerke and Maria, and seeing the results on my kids was just overwhelming

612
00:45:15,174 --> 00:45:18,278
I started crying I said this is powerful stuff

613
00:45:18,302 --> 00:45:23,569
Anyone can do it and it's really something that has been transformational to me

614
00:45:23,682 --> 00:45:26,911
as you been experiencing what we've been exploring so far

615
00:45:26,935 --> 00:45:30,268
you may be wondering whether or not you can do this

616
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,013
you also may be experiencing some push or pull inside

617
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:36,967
that too is completely part of the process

618
00:45:37,571 --> 00:45:40,967
even though it's simple we don't always make it easy

619
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:45,324
we highly complicate everything that we do including this process

620
00:45:45,621 --> 00:45:50,221
so here's a humorous look at what we all do when we're not letting go

621
00:45:52,336 --> 00:45:56,536
we all have this coping mechanism or compensations for emotions

622
00:45:56,798 --> 00:45:58,465
but this what we're doing

623
00:45:58,884 --> 00:46:02,151
I'm gonna stand up to do this so everyone can see

624
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:06,349
yeah

625
00:46:17,194 --> 00:46:18,261
and you know....

626
00:46:22,407 --> 00:46:26,340
that takes a little effort so could you just do this inside

627
00:46:30,123 --> 00:46:31,123
just open

628
00:46:37,422 --> 00:46:38,422
ok

629
00:46:42,386 --> 00:46:43,279
Yeah it feels better

630
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:45,636
right, exactly, that's a little key

631
00:46:46,098 --> 00:46:52,165
the mind lies to us, it tells us that if we let the emotion up we're gonna be a basket case

632
00:46:53,605 --> 00:47:00,998
but most of us are walking around with one foot in the basket all the time

633
00:47:01,321 --> 00:47:03,988
and we wonder why we trip and fall a lot

634
00:47:05,033 --> 00:47:08,766
because we're so busy juggling the emotion believing that

635
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:11,596
if we just let it up and let it go

636
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:14,183
it's gonna be worse

637
00:47:14,877 --> 00:47:16,877
that's what the mind tells us,

638
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,053
and sometimes that's even what society tells us

639
00:47:22,718 --> 00:47:23,985
but it's never true

640
00:47:25,053 --> 00:47:28,053
As you let go one of the things you'll notice

641
00:47:28,098 --> 00:47:31,431
is that you laugh a lot more and a lot more easily

642
00:47:32,895 --> 00:47:35,498
you'll also notice that when you release

643
00:47:35,522 --> 00:47:37,322
it's accompanied by laughter

644
00:47:38,483 --> 00:47:43,216
cause laughter is already one of the natural ways that all of us let go

645
00:47:45,616 --> 00:47:47,927
I think the main thing that I have learned

646
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:55,000
is that the truth is that you don't have to understand

647
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:59,883
or comprehend, that the most perfect

648
00:47:59,963 --> 00:48:05,696
and the most grater things is the emptiness that we have

649
00:48:06,053 --> 00:48:09,186
that's like perfect, there's nothing more to it

650
00:48:10,516 --> 00:48:16,183
and that the trick of life is accepting that is nothing more in life than that is now

651
00:48:24,071 --> 00:48:26,404
what you'll find that as you let go

652
00:48:27,115 --> 00:48:29,782
as you discover the truth of who you are

653
00:48:30,452 --> 00:48:36,885
you'll find that you naturally and effortlessly think more positively

654
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:42,273
and so what happens is as you let go and allow yourself to be what you already are

655
00:48:42,297 --> 00:48:47,364
the mind gets quieter but you also discover that there is this

656
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:49,970
wonderful quiet with the mind

657
00:48:50,973 --> 00:48:53,973
you let the mind think whatever it does

658
00:48:54,142 --> 00:48:57,609
and by allowing the mind to simply do it's own thing

659
00:48:58,063 --> 00:48:59,930
and not taking it personally

660
00:49:00,649 --> 00:49:02,249
it seems to write itself

661
00:49:02,985 --> 00:49:08,385
it seems to naturally create more and more positive

662
00:49:09,116 --> 00:49:12,183
and the less you effort at this

663
00:49:12,494 --> 00:49:14,681
the more you allow it to be natural

664
00:49:14,705 --> 00:49:15,838
the simpler it is

665
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:20,716
and if you allow yourself to be open to what is

666
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:24,744
you find that it's very friendly, it's very compassionate

667
00:49:25,591 --> 00:49:28,858
it's very loving, and there's enough for everyone

668
00:49:31,263 --> 00:49:33,796
most of us live in a sea of "If only"s

669
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,800
If only we had more money, better relationships,

670
00:49:38,187 --> 00:49:41,987
more toys, then we would be happy

671
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:46,629
but if you haven't already notice when you postpone your happiness

672
00:49:46,653 --> 00:49:51,320
when you want something instead of having it you never seem to get it

673
00:49:51,575 --> 00:49:55,054
what you discover as you let go is that most of us have

674
00:49:55,078 --> 00:49:57,411
the way we live with life backwards

675
00:49:57,789 --> 00:50:02,522
we think we don't have what we want because we haven't wanted it enough

676
00:50:02,836 --> 00:50:04,769
but the exact opposite is true

677
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:11,946
the more you let go of wanting the more you feel like you have and the more you manifest in life

678
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:15,170
because want does not equal having

679
00:50:15,432 --> 00:50:19,099
want is a feeling of I can't have it or I don't have it

680
00:50:19,228 --> 00:50:23,374
and when you can see that and let go of wanting the more you discover

681
00:50:23,398 --> 00:50:24,665
you can have it all

682
00:50:28,862 --> 00:50:31,674
I've been doing the Sedona Method for 2 years now

683
00:50:31,698 --> 00:50:36,631
and prior to the Sedona Method everything in my life was all about wanting

684
00:50:37,412 --> 00:50:41,142
I wanted control, I wanted more money I wanted more success

685
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:44,366
I wanted, everything was wanting wanting wanting

686
00:50:44,711 --> 00:50:50,244
and things I wanted my whole life I've been never able to accomplish

687
00:50:50,634 --> 00:50:53,634
even though I had quite a few accomplishments

688
00:50:53,804 --> 00:50:56,658
but no the big ones that I really really wanted

689
00:50:56,682 --> 00:51:00,549
and am so just to share with everybody else

690
00:51:00,686 --> 00:51:04,619
by releasing all of that wanting, Constantly

691
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:10,266
I am now manifesting things that were beyond my imagination two years ago

692
00:51:10,487 --> 00:51:11,887
so it's just profound

693
00:51:13,615 --> 00:51:17,348
and I've made a lot of money because I'm very driven guy

694
00:51:17,452 --> 00:51:19,985
and totally goal oriented and all that

695
00:51:20,539 --> 00:51:27,339
but now I’m making more in a month than I would in a year just a few years ago

696
00:51:27,796 --> 00:51:31,860
and yet it doesn't matter to me because I'm released on it anyway

697
00:51:31,884 --> 00:51:39,000
you're a living example of how when you let go you gain more with less effort

698
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:44,332
you've been suggesting less and less
over the time we've known each other

699
00:51:44,771 --> 00:51:48,999
and gaining more and more with less and less effort

700
00:51:49,151 --> 00:51:50,284
and that's normal

701
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:54,883
we don’t realize it's normal because we're so busy doing something else

702
00:51:54,907 --> 00:52:02,440
and then the other thing is that
We do support people on working on goals

703
00:52:02,998 --> 00:52:05,560
what you're doing is you're setting a clear intention

704
00:52:05,584 --> 00:52:09,917
and then you are consciously inviting
 up all the thoughts and feelings

705
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:12,567
to the contrary and you're letting them go

706
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:17,739
and what you notice very quickly is all of the sudden you can see and feel and hear

707
00:52:17,763 --> 00:52:20,096
the goal already being accomplished

708
00:52:20,432 --> 00:52:26,099
and so all that unlimited energy that you are is flowing in that particular direction

709
00:52:29,858 --> 00:52:34,991
It's ironic I think I've had actually more success since I started letting go

710
00:52:35,364 --> 00:52:36,831
of wanting the success

711
00:52:37,282 --> 00:52:41,012
I used to take a lot of action steps, and there was a lot of doing

712
00:52:41,036 --> 00:52:44,569
and pushing and forcing and try to make things happen

713
00:52:44,915 --> 00:52:48,500
and this second I just let that all fall away

714
00:52:48,877 --> 00:52:52,210
was when things just started miraclessly showing up

715
00:52:52,548 --> 00:52:55,481
Life just flows to me now, life just happens

716
00:52:56,093 --> 00:53:00,360
a lot of people refer to me and say ??????? you're so damn lucky

717
00:53:00,514 --> 00:53:03,714
I say you know luck has nothing to do with this,

718
00:53:03,809 --> 00:53:07,831
luck is when opportunity and preparation collides, they meet each other

719
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:12,000
as you let go and open to the truth of who you are

720
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:15,964
you get all this little tickles inside that are really fun

721
00:53:15,988 --> 00:53:20,468
but you may get confused, you may think that you have to live life differently

722
00:53:20,492 --> 00:53:22,559
and that may or may not be true

723
00:53:22,828 --> 00:53:26,561
what you discover, as you let go is that life goes on

724
00:53:26,832 --> 00:53:30,032
but it goes on from a very different perspective

725
00:53:30,127 --> 00:53:33,460
you have greater ease, greater Joy, greater happiness

726
00:53:35,591 --> 00:53:40,058
and you know no matter what's happening around you that all is well

727
00:53:44,683 --> 00:53:51,950
So I feel fabulous,

728
00:53:52,357 --> 00:53:53,357
and

729
00:53:57,446 --> 00:54:00,999
I'm having these questions now

730
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:02,450
yes

731
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:10,834
the only things that are on the agenda are getting in a car and driving back to where I live

732
00:54:11,126 --> 00:54:12,126
and

733
00:54:13,253 --> 00:54:14,253
then what?

734
00:54:18,258 --> 00:54:20,125
I really like the way I feel

735
00:54:26,892 --> 00:54:30,892
9 of 10 things that were on my to do list before I left home

736
00:54:32,397 --> 00:54:36,864
I've already mentally crossed of the list coz I don't care any more

737
00:54:39,446 --> 00:54:40,446
Okay

738
00:54:52,042 --> 00:54:54,242
you just wonder around like this?

739
00:55:10,185 --> 00:55:12,789
Does that question doesn't even make any sense?

740
00:55:12,813 --> 00:55:14,680
Of course, it actually does.

741
00:55:16,275 --> 00:55:21,500
This is something that I'd like to point out to all of you

742
00:55:21,905 --> 00:55:23,466
this is what the mind does

743
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:28,012
as you start to discover what you are the mind wants to turn that into something

744
00:55:28,036 --> 00:55:30,473
special, meaningful and important to

745
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:33,630
and it thinks that the externals need to change

746
00:55:35,335 --> 00:55:39,935
nothing needs to change in order for you to be what you already are

747
00:55:40,757 --> 00:55:46,999
and the Joy, The Bliss, The Relaxation, The Knowingness

748
00:55:47,306 --> 00:55:55,839
all those things that most of you are experiencing in this moment are what's natural

749
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:58,990
It's what's always been here

750
00:55:59,484 --> 00:56:06,951
and life doesn't stop, life continues

751
00:56:07,117 --> 00:56:14,250
what stops is creating suffering

752
00:56:15,501 --> 00:56:16,478
that works for me

753
00:56:16,502 --> 00:56:17,502
good

754
00:56:21,215 --> 00:56:22,215
Okay

755
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:32,619
I had the privilege that I have been born in a country

756
00:56:32,643 --> 00:56:38,043
where I was very much exposed from a very young age

757
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:41,857
to Sufis and poets like Rumi and Huffet

758
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:45,423
we talked about all of the stuff that we talk about here at Sedona

759
00:56:45,447 --> 00:56:47,008
suddenly it just became very clear

760
00:56:47,032 --> 00:56:51,596
without really any effort, that you really don't need to go outside of yourself

761
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:53,056
to look for the answers

762
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,880
finally I got myself a tool to be able to stay in the now

763
00:56:58,210 --> 00:56:59,210
and it's lovely

764
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:03,817
I'm a different person, I know I am, I mean I feel it internally

765
00:57:03,841 --> 00:57:07,774
I have had 4/5 of my dearest closest friends

766
00:57:07,803 --> 00:57:10,198
have actually told me in the last 3 or 4 months

767
00:57:10,222 --> 00:57:13,159
it's just profound the changes that have taken place in my life

768
00:57:13,183 --> 00:57:16,329
I’m a completely different person that I was 3 or 4 years ago

769
00:57:16,353 --> 00:57:19,000
things don't seem like work any more

770
00:57:19,189 --> 00:57:24,256
things are just like a project, there just fun

771
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:26,070
and I like that

772
00:57:27,406 --> 00:57:32,539
I never imagine that I’ll could be making the kinds of radical

773
00:57:32,911 --> 00:57:37,244
once would have been terrifying changes in my life,

774
00:57:37,457 --> 00:57:39,324
and there's no fear any more

775
00:57:46,592 --> 00:57:50,350
as you let go one of the things you'll notice

776
00:57:50,429 --> 00:57:54,362
is that your heart opens and you're filled with compassion

777
00:57:54,516 --> 00:57:57,916
you're filled with love, you're filled with caring

778
00:57:58,437 --> 00:58:01,708
both for yourself, your friends, your relatives

779
00:58:01,732 --> 00:58:06,265
and the whole planet, and this will naturally move you into action

780
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,853
you'll do more to help your fellow man

781
00:58:09,448 --> 00:58:11,648
you'll do more to help the world,

782
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:14,283
and you'll do more to help yourself

783
00:58:14,661 --> 00:58:16,806
there is this Hope for myself personally

784
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,097
and for the Planet,

785
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:21,728
and what help I can give to the other people

786
00:58:21,752 --> 00:58:23,485
I work as a hospice chapel

787
00:58:23,587 --> 00:58:25,440
so I was looking for some more tools

788
00:58:25,464 --> 00:58:28,693
to work with people with different belief systems

789
00:58:28,717 --> 00:58:30,450
and also that it's gentle,

790
00:58:31,595 --> 00:58:34,741
because I work with some people in some really fragile states

791
00:58:34,765 --> 00:58:37,327
so I started reading about Sedona Method

792
00:58:37,351 --> 00:58:38,618
I went to a seminar

793
00:58:39,978 --> 00:58:43,178
and I found it really transformational in myself

794
00:58:43,273 --> 00:58:45,460
and so I started using it with patients

795
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:49,017
I ask people: "So you have this fear in your body?"

796
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:55,440
Do you wanna keep that fear or would you like to get rid of it?

797
00:58:56,078 --> 00:58:57,347
I'd like to get rid of it

798
00:58:57,371 --> 00:59:00,971
So will you just sit with me and answer some questions

799
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:04,854
so where do you find that fear in your body? How would you describe it?

800
00:59:04,878 --> 00:59:07,982
Often times they say, "Oh I feel some tightness here"

801
00:59:08,006 --> 00:59:10,443
Okay, so you feel some tightness here

802
00:59:10,467 --> 00:59:14,864
Is that something that you wanna to hang on to or would you like to let it go

803
00:59:14,888 --> 00:59:16,288
I'd like to let it go

804
00:59:17,391 --> 00:59:18,791
Could you let it go??

805
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,960
Some people look around and think "I guess I could"

806
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:27,340
Would you be willing to let that go?

807
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:29,610
Yeah, I would be

808
00:59:30,654 --> 00:59:31,987
Then I ask: "When?"

809
00:59:33,323 --> 00:59:34,323
Now?

810
00:59:35,242 --> 00:59:38,575
And then you're watching them just whhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

811
00:59:39,496 --> 00:59:42,851
and they finally realize they don't have to hang on to that

812
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:45,808
and then you just take them through it again

813
00:59:52,092 --> 00:59:54,959
In this moment can you feel the nothingness?

814
00:59:59,349 --> 01:00:06,349
See if you can find where nothing ends and something begins?

815
01:00:09,776 --> 01:00:12,709
or where everything ends and nothing begins?

816
01:00:14,323 --> 01:00:17,635
one of the questions that has been coming up in all of the minds in this room

817
01:00:17,659 --> 01:00:18,992
is now what do I do?

818
01:00:19,828 --> 01:00:21,695
first of all remember the basics

819
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:25,648
feelings are just feelings, they are not facts

820
01:00:27,002 --> 01:00:29,802
and they are not you, and you can let them go

821
01:00:30,172 --> 01:00:32,984
and you can let them go by simply deciding to drop them

822
01:00:33,008 --> 01:00:35,236
and using questions like Could I let this go?

823
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:36,460
Would I? and When?

824
01:00:37,095 --> 01:00:38,740
or you can say it in the third person

825
01:00:38,764 --> 01:00:41,534
Could you let this go? Would you? and When?

826
01:00:41,558 --> 01:00:46,825
remember that simple questions are incredibly powerful because they are simple

827
01:00:47,022 --> 01:00:50,084
it doesn't need to be hard, it doesn't need to be complex

828
01:00:50,108 --> 01:00:51,175
in fact it isn't

829
01:00:51,401 --> 01:00:55,534
and so the other thing you can do is to simply welcome what is

830
01:00:55,697 --> 01:00:57,964
which by the way is the same thing

831
01:00:58,367 --> 01:01:00,034
so as you welcome what is

832
01:01:01,286 --> 01:01:04,182
you can welcome simply whatever you are experiencing in the moment

833
01:01:04,206 --> 01:01:06,684
which is by the way great way to release in action

834
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:12,708
just simply do this inside, just simply stay open to what is

835
01:01:12,714 --> 01:01:15,527
the more open you are the more transparent you are

836
01:01:15,551 --> 01:01:18,818
the less there is any place for anything to stick

837
01:01:19,221 --> 01:01:21,888
and you can also take it a little deeper

838
01:01:22,182 --> 01:01:26,382
by welcoming what you believe is the problem of the moment

839
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:31,447
and then welcoming any wanting to fix it or change it

840
01:01:32,317 --> 01:01:34,917
and then welcome any identity with them

841
01:01:35,404 --> 01:01:38,337
if you've noticed, those three things combined

842
01:01:39,032 --> 01:01:44,499
when you welcome the appearance, the memory, the thought, the belief, the problem

843
01:01:44,997 --> 01:01:49,936
you welcome all the thoughts and feelings, and sensations and pictures and sounds

844
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,563
that are associated with it

845
01:01:51,587 --> 01:01:55,187
and then you also welcome all your wanting to meddle

846
01:01:55,591 --> 01:01:59,191
wanting to fix, wanting to change, wanting to force it,

847
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:02,490
wanting to control it, wanting to figure it out

848
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:05,447
when you welcome all of that what happens is

849
01:02:05,601 --> 01:02:07,201
there's an opening inside

850
01:02:08,812 --> 01:02:12,012
and then as you also welcome any sense of identity

851
01:02:12,482 --> 01:02:16,349
any sense that it's personal, it's about me, about who I am

852
01:02:16,987 --> 01:02:22,120
that unhooks it, you stop feeding that illusion

853
01:02:22,284 --> 01:02:25,951
and then it can spin freely and spin out of existence

854
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:30,313
and what you notice is that you are already the field

855
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:34,951
you're already the screen, you're already presence of awareness

856
01:02:35,714 --> 01:02:40,781
that allows for all experiencing yet is unaffected or uninvolved in any of it

857
01:02:42,262 --> 01:02:46,462
and then of course at any moment you can discover or reremember

858
01:02:48,185 --> 01:02:49,185
just two things

859
01:02:51,063 --> 01:02:55,263
that that presence of awareness, that beingness, that easiness,

860
01:02:55,317 --> 01:02:58,050
that truth, that love, that peace, that Joy

861
01:02:59,446 --> 01:03:05,246
that you are, is already here, already now

862
01:03:05,577 --> 01:03:07,444
already completely unencumbered

863
01:03:08,121 --> 01:03:12,521
and that what you often believe you were or you are in this moment

864
01:03:13,168 --> 01:03:15,235
doesn't bare direct examination

865
01:03:16,255 --> 01:03:19,922
what you discover is that If you try to find the separate me

866
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:23,154
you'll discover it's not there

867
01:03:23,178 --> 01:03:25,111
you can certainly remember it

868
01:03:26,139 --> 01:03:28,006
you can certainly imagine it

869
01:03:28,141 --> 01:03:30,741
but it's still doesn't make it real now

870
01:03:30,769 --> 01:03:34,541
one of the things you'll discover as you keep letting go is

871
01:03:34,565 --> 01:03:38,032
what you are requires no belief to be

872
01:03:38,694 --> 01:03:40,161
it's beyond all belief

873
01:03:40,612 --> 01:03:44,945
so if you find that you've turn something positive into belief

874
01:03:45,033 --> 01:03:46,633
just dig a little deeper

875
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:50,660
after all would you rather believe you have a million dollars

876
01:03:50,956 --> 01:03:53,768
or would you rather see it in your bank account

877
01:03:53,792 --> 01:03:56,688
would you rather believe that you have good health

878
01:03:56,712 --> 01:03:59,232
or would you rather be living it in every moment

879
01:03:59,256 --> 01:04:03,723
would you rather believe that there is no separation

880
01:04:05,095 --> 01:04:10,228
or would you like to have that be your living experience now

881
01:04:12,728 --> 01:04:16,728
and so don't settle for any belief, no matter who is peddling it


882
01:04:18,442 --> 01:04:23,175
settle for nothing less than what you are

883
01:04:23,363 --> 01:04:30,230
and also allow being what you are to be fun

884
01:04:30,662 --> 01:04:32,262
to be natural, to be easy

885
01:04:34,082 --> 01:04:36,149
it doesn't require effort to be

886
01:04:37,503 --> 01:04:40,903
so every moment allow yourself to be more interested

887
01:04:41,423 --> 01:04:43,356
in what's actually is here now

888
01:04:44,801 --> 01:04:51,401
nothing is required for you to be what you already are

889
01:04:51,683 --> 01:04:53,683
I love you all unconditionally

890
01:04:53,977 --> 01:04:55,977
thank you for sharing yourself

891
01:04:56,104 --> 01:04:58,904
thank you for your willingness to show up
 
892
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:00,900
and to be seen

893
01:05:01,902 --> 01:05:07,369
and to support this planet in this wonderful change

894
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,867
this wonderful unfolding

895
01:05:11,286 --> 01:05:14,286
every release you've done is not just for you

896
01:05:14,706 --> 01:05:15,839
it's for everyone

897
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:21,175
every release you'll ever do is not just for you  

898
01:05:21,713 --> 01:05:24,713
it's for everyone, we're all in this together

899
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:46,067
What you've just seen is an invitation for the healing of planet Earth

900
01:05:46,405 --> 01:05:51,272
and invitation for you to lead a happier richer and more love filled life

901
01:05:52,452 --> 01:05:57,852
an invitation for you to share what you've learned with those that you care about

902
01:05:58,375 --> 01:05:59,936
starting with each and everyone of us

903
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,693
letting go of all that is holding us back

904
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,413
and being all we can be

905
01:06:05,424 --> 01:06:07,424
starting right here, right now

906
01:06:09,636 --> 01:06:12,198
the Sedona Method shows you how to uncover

907
01:06:12,222 --> 01:06:15,889
and live that presence of awareness that is always here

908
01:06:17,102 --> 01:06:21,302
always now, shining in plain view

909
01:06:21,773 --> 01:06:25,999
as you let go, as you simply allow yourself to notice

910
01:06:26,111 --> 01:06:27,778
what is actually here now

911
01:06:28,822 --> 01:06:34,022
you'll discover that right here, right now you're already whole

912
01:06:34,536 --> 01:06:38,336
you're already complete, you're already enough as you are

913
01:06:40,292 --> 01:06:42,292
and all is well

914
01:06:44,882 --> 01:06:49,882
Letting Go
