1
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,714
<i>You ready?</i>

2
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:23,116
<i>No, just... Yeah, just-just</i>
<i>ignore the microphone.</i>

3
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,118
<i>Yeah, just-just act as if</i>
<i>it's not there.</i>

4
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:27,689
<i>Sing as if it's not there.</i>

5
00:01:27,722 --> 00:01:31,358
<i>Yeah, uh... </i>

6
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:40,902
<i>Okay?</i>

7
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:46,581
-Ready for them?
-Yes.

8
00:05:46,614 --> 00:05:47,815
Let's go.

9
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,725
<i>If you're here,</i>
<i>then you already know</i>

10
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:00,094
<i>who she is, and that is one</i>
<i>of the most important</i>

11
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,597
<i>musical figures of our time.</i>

12
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,665
<i>Lydia Tár is many things:</i>

13
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:08,002
<i>a piano performance graduate</i>
<i>at the Curtis Institute,</i>

14
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,605
<i>Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard.</i>

15
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:14,742
<i>She got her PhD in Musicology</i>
<i>from the University of Vienna,</i>

16
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:17,444
<i>specializing in</i>
<i>the indigenous music</i>

17
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:20,413
<i>of the Ucayali Valley</i>
<i>in Eastern Peru,</i>

18
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:22,449
<i>where she spent five years</i>

19
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,451
<i>among the Shipibo-Konibo people.</i>

20
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,955
<i>As a conductor,</i>
<i>Tár began her career</i>

21
00:06:27,989 --> 00:06:29,456
<i>with the Cleveland Orchestra,</i>

22
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,925
<i>one of the so-called</i>
<i>"Big Five."</i>

23
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,160
<i>A string of</i>
<i>important posts followed,</i>

24
00:06:33,194 --> 00:06:35,763
<i>including</i>
<i>the Philadelphia Orchestra,</i>

25
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:37,064
<i>the Chicago Symphony Orchestra,</i>

26
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:38,532
<i>the Boston Symphony Orchestra,</i>

27
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:40,467
<i>until she at last arrived here</i>

28
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:43,537
<i>at our own</i>
<i>New York Philharmonic.</i>

29
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:44,906
<i>With the latter, she organized</i>

30
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:47,608
<i>the Highway 10</i>
<i>refugee concerts in Zaatari,</i>

31
00:06:47,642 --> 00:06:51,913
<i>which were attended</i>
<i>by over 75,000 people.</i>

32
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:53,648
<i>She's become particularly</i>
<i>well-known</i>

33
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:55,516
<i>for commissioning</i>
<i>contemporary work</i>

34
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:58,686
<i>from, among others,</i>
<i>Jennifer Higdon, Caroline Shaw,</i>

35
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:01,055
<i>Julia Wolfe</i>
<i>and Hildur Gudnadóttir.</i>

36
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:04,191
<i>And she's made a point</i>
<i>of programming their works</i>

37
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:07,460
<i>alongside composers</i>
<i>of the canon.</i>

38
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,796
<i>She's been quoted as saying,</i>

39
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:11,666
<i>"These composers</i>
<i>are having a conversation</i>

40
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:14,669
<i>and it may not always</i>
<i>be so polite."</i>

41
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:17,171
<i>Lydia Tár has also written</i>
<i>music for the stage and screen.</i>

42
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:21,943
<i>She is in fact one of only 15</i>
<i>so-called EGOTs, meaning those</i>

43
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:26,213
<i>who have won all four</i>
<i>major entertainment awards:</i>

44
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:29,951
<i>an Emmy, a Grammy,</i>
<i>an Oscar and a Tony.</i>

45
00:07:29,984 --> 00:07:31,619
<i>It is, as you can imagine,</i>

46
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:33,988
<i>an extremely short</i>
<i>and shimmering list</i>

47
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:37,124
<i>that includes Richard Rodgers,</i>
<i>Audrey Hepburn,</i>

48
00:07:37,158 --> 00:07:41,062
<i>Andrew Lloyd Webber</i>
<i>and, of course, Mel Brooks.</i>

49
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:48,235
In 2010, with
the support of Eliot Kaplan,

50
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:51,238
she founded the Accordion
Conducting Fellowship,

51
00:07:51,272 --> 00:07:54,275
which fosters entrepreneurship
and performance opportunities

52
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:57,645
for female conductors,
allowing them residencies

53
00:07:57,678 --> 00:08:00,581
with major orchestras
around the world.

54
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:05,686
In 2013, Berlin elected Tár
as its principal conductor,

55
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,155
in succession to Andris Davis,

56
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:11,125
and she's remained there
ever since.

57
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,994
Like her mentor,
Leonard Bernstein,

58
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:16,130
Tár has a particular
affinity for Mahler,

59
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,265
whose nine symphonies
she recorded

60
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:20,634
during her Big Five stints.

61
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:23,104
However, she never managed
to complete

62
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:26,874
the so-called "cycle" with
a single orchestra until now.

63
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:27,942
Under her direction,

64
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:30,277
Berlin has recorded eight
of the Mahler symphonies,

65
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:33,147
saving the big one,
Symphony No. 5, for last.

66
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,216
Due to the pandemic,
that performance,

67
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:38,019
which was scheduled for
last year, had to be canceled.

68
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:39,887
But I'm told that next month,

69
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,656
she'll make a live recording
of Mahler's Fifth,

70
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,158
which will complete the cycle

71
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:47,895
and will be issued in a box set
by Deutsche Grammophon

72
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:50,031
just in time
for Mahler's birthday.

73
00:08:50,064 --> 00:08:53,934
As if that's not enough,
her new book, <i>Tár on Tár,</i>

74
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:57,772
will be published by Nan
Talese's imprint at Doubleday,

75
00:08:57,805 --> 00:09:00,908
just in time for Christmas,
a perfect stocking stuffer,

76
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:03,244
especially if you have
a very large stocking.

77
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:06,614
All of us at <i>The New Yorker</i>
welcome you.

78
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,282
Thank you for joining us,
Maestro, today.

79
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,151
Thank you, Adam. Thank you.

80
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:12,753
Thank you.

81
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:16,023
Lydia, I couldn't...

82
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:19,293
I couldn't help but see you
flinch just a little bit

83
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,995
as I was reading your bio.

84
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:23,064
Was it because I forgot
some other amazing achievement?

85
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:25,666
Or do you have
a slight self-consciousness

86
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,802
about the incredibly
varied things

87
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:29,837
that you've accomplished?

88
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:34,942
Well, in today's world,
"varied," it-it's a dirty word.

89
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,044
I mean,
our era is one of specialists,

90
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:39,980
and if you're trying to do
more than one thing,

91
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:41,816
it's, you know,
it's often frowned upon.

92
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:43,317
Every artist gets typecast.

93
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,919
Oh, yes. Aggressively so.

94
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,720
Well, do you think there'll be
a moment, though,

95
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,856
when the classical music
community,

96
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:52,226
uh, decides not to use
sexual distinctions

97
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,361
to differentiate artists?

98
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:56,730
I'm probably
the wrong person to ask

99
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:59,100
since I don't, uh,
read reviews.

100
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:00,768
-Never, really?
-No.

101
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:04,939
But it is odd, I-I think,
that anyone ever felt compelled

102
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:07,908
to substitute
"maestro" with "maestra."

103
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:11,178
I mean, we don't call women
astronauts "astronettes."

104
00:10:11,212 --> 00:10:12,980
Mm-hmm. Right.

105
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:16,817
But as to the question
of, uh, gender bias,

106
00:10:16,851 --> 00:10:19,253
I really have nothing
to complain about.

107
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:22,389
Nor, for that matter, should
Marin Alsop, JoAnn Falletta,

108
00:10:22,423 --> 00:10:24,825
uh, Laurence Equilbey
and Nathalie Stutzmann.

109
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:27,428
I mean, there's so many
incredible women

110
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:28,996
who came before us.

111
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,365
You know, women who did
the-the real lifting.

112
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:32,733
That-that's fascinating.

113
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,735
Can you... Who, for instance?

114
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:35,936
Uh, okay, sure.

115
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,105
Uh, first and foremost,
Nadia Boulanger.

116
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:41,075
I mean, that would be
the, uh, happy example.

117
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:44,278
Uh, the sad one would be
Antonia Brico,

118
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,214
who by all accounts
was an incredible conductor

119
00:10:47,248 --> 00:10:50,718
but was ghettoized
into the nonglamorous status

120
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,753
of a "guest conductor"

121
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:55,689
and essentially
treated as a dog act.

122
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:57,892
A dog...
Uh, she never got the chance

123
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,026
to lead a major orchestra?

124
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,095
Well, yes.
Yes, she did, uh, conduct

125
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:03,430
the, uh, Berlin Philharmonic,
as well as the Met,

126
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:06,767
but, again,
only as a guest conductor.

127
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,435
You know, at, I mean,
at that time it was...

128
00:11:08,469 --> 00:11:10,871
it was all gender spectacle.

129
00:11:10,905 --> 00:11:12,406
But fortunately, times change,

130
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,175
and-and the Pauline
conversion is...

131
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,043
- "Pauline..."
- ... if not complete,

132
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:17,778
then it's-it's evolving nicely.

133
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,314
N-No less, um,
having fallen off its horse.

134
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,750
Um, Lydia, could we talk
a little bit

135
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,852
-about, uh, translation?
-Mm-hmm.

136
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:26,353
'Cause I think
there's still people

137
00:11:26,387 --> 00:11:29,890
who think of the conductor
as a kind of human metronome.

138
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:33,894
Well, yeah,
that's-that's partly true.

139
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:35,763
-Yeah, but it's...
-But keeping time,

140
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:37,198
it's-it's no small thing.

141
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:39,366
But I suspect there's
a lot more to it than that.

142
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,968
Yeah, well,
I-I would hope so, yes.

143
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,804
-But time is the thing.
-Uh-huh.

144
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:47,975
Time is-is the essential piece
of, uh, interpretation.

145
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,810
You cannot start without me.

146
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,879
See, I start the clock.

147
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:55,216
Now, my left hand shapes,
but my right hand,

148
00:11:55,249 --> 00:11:59,820
the second hand, marks time
and moves it forward.

149
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:03,525
However, unlike a clock,
sometimes my second hand stops,

150
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:06,827
which means that time stops.

151
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,964
Now, the illusion is that,
like you,

152
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:12,166
I'm responding to
the orchestra in real time...

153
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,368
-Right, right. -... making the
decision about the right moment

154
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,970
to restart the thing,
or reset it,

155
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:18,839
or throw time out
the window altogether.

156
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,976
The reality is that right
from the very beginning,

157
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:24,078
I know precisely
what time it is...

158
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:26,013
-Really? That's...
-... and the exact moment

159
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:29,016
that you and I will arrive
at our destination together.

160
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:32,554
You know, the only real,
uh, discovery for me

161
00:12:32,587 --> 00:12:34,488
is in rehearsal.

162
00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:36,390
It's never,
never in performance.

163
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:40,427
Hard question, I know, but
if you could define one thing

164
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:43,364
that Bernstein gave you,
what would it be?

165
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:46,834
Kavvanah.

166
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,102
Yeah, it's-it's the Hebrew word

167
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:51,038
for attention to meaning
or-or intent.

168
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,940
You know, what are
the composer's priorities,

169
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:55,142
and what are yours, and how do
they complement one another?

170
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:57,144
Right, kavvanah. I think
that's a word that will have

171
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:59,313
a slightly different meaning
for many in our audience.

172
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:02,584
Well, yes, yes, I imagine so.

173
00:13:02,617 --> 00:13:04,084
Am I right in thinking
that a conductor

174
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:06,887
was not always, uh,
an onstage presence

175
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,255
-in classical music?
-No, that's right.

176
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:10,291
I-I think I read someplace
that it actually was

177
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:12,359
the first violin, for a long
time, who was responsible.

178
00:13:12,393 --> 00:13:15,229
Yes, the first violinist,
whether they had any interest

179
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:16,897
or-or skill in it or not.

180
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,567
Wh-When did that change,
and-and who changed it?

181
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:22,903
With the French composer,
Jean-Baptiste Lully,

182
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:26,907
who reportedly, uh,
used a, uh, rather enormous,

183
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,911
rather pointy staff to pound
the tempi into the floor.

184
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,146
It's not something I imagine

185
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:34,516
the players particularly,
uh, appreciated.

186
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:38,452
Uh, anyway, uh, that technique
ended during a performance

187
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,454
when Lully accidentally

188
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,923
stabbed himself in the foot
with the thing and died.

189
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,593
Yeah, of-of-of gangrene.

190
00:13:45,627 --> 00:13:47,529
But anyway...

191
00:13:47,562 --> 00:13:50,431
Yeah.

192
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:53,934
Anyway, but the conductor

193
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:57,539
really becomes essential
as the ensembles get bigger.

194
00:13:57,572 --> 00:14:00,174
And once again,
we go back to Beethoven.

195
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:03,210
♪ Buh, buh, buh, bum,
buh, buh, buh, bum. ♪

196
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:05,245
Now, that doesn't start
with the eighth note.

197
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,915
The downbeat--
♪ Buh, buh, buh -- ♪

198
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:09,551
it's silent, right?

199
00:14:09,584 --> 00:14:12,152
So someone had to start
that clock.

200
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:15,155
Someone had to, uh,
plant their flag in the sand

201
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:17,925
and say, "Follow me," you know?

202
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,228
And when that someone was
Lenny, the orchestra was led

203
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:25,366
on the most extraordinary
tour of pleasures.

204
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:28,435
'Cause he knew the music,
Mahler especially,

205
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:30,538
as well or better than anyone.

206
00:14:30,572 --> 00:14:33,974
And he would often play
with the form.

207
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:35,309
'Cause he wanted an orchestra
to feel

208
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:37,512
that they had never seen,
let alone heard

209
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:40,515
or-or performed
any of that music.

210
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:42,950
So he-he would do
radical things,

211
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:45,152
like, uh, disregarding
the tempo primo

212
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,589
or-or ending this phrase
molto ritardando,

213
00:14:47,622 --> 00:14:50,290
even though
it had no such marking.

214
00:14:50,324 --> 00:14:51,593
Was he over-egging it?

215
00:14:51,626 --> 00:14:53,193
Oh, no, no, no. Not at all.

216
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:57,030
He, he, he celebrated the joy
of his discovery.

217
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,465
You just told us a moment ago

218
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:01,068
that your discovery
takes place in rehearsal.

219
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:03,505
When will that process
begin again for you?

220
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:05,973
We start on Monday.

221
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:07,941
-Immediately?
-Mm.

222
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:10,277
With this one,
it really is about

223
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:14,716
trying to read the tea leaves
of-of Mahler's intention.

224
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:16,417
I mean, we know a great deal
about this

225
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,152
with his other symphonies.

226
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:20,354
You know, he was so inspired
by the poetry of Rückert

227
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:22,690
that for years he didn't set
another author to music.

228
00:15:22,724 --> 00:15:25,693
But all of this changes
with the Five.

229
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:28,162
The Five is a mystery.

230
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:30,998
And the only clue he leaves us

231
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:33,033
is on the cover
of the manuscript itself.

232
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:37,037
Yes, the-the dedication
to his new wife, Alma.

233
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,039
So if you're gonna partner
with Mahler

234
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,709
on his, uh, fifth symphony,

235
00:15:41,743 --> 00:15:43,343
the first thing you must do

236
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:47,715
is try to understand
that very complex marriage.

237
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:50,618
And would you say that you have
a different interpretation

238
00:15:50,652 --> 00:15:53,086
of that marriage
than Bernstein did?

239
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:59,159
You mentioned my ethnographic
fieldwork in the Amazon.

240
00:15:59,193 --> 00:16:01,995
Well, Adam, the Shipibo-Konibo

241
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:04,599
only receive an <i>icaro,</i> or song,

242
00:16:04,632 --> 00:16:06,400
if the singer is there, right?

243
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:10,304
On the same side of the-the
spirit that-that created it.

244
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:13,775
And in that way, the past
and the present converge.

245
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:17,377
It's the flip sides
of the same cosmic coin.

246
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:20,380
That definition of fidelity
makes sense to me.

247
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:23,016
But Lenny,
he believed in <i>teshuvah.</i>

248
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,352
The Talmudic power
to reach back into time

249
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:28,355
and-and transform
the, uh, significance

250
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:29,624
of one's past deeds.

251
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:34,127
So when he played the Adagietto
at Robert Kennedy's funeral,

252
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,263
it ran for 12 minutes.

253
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:38,633
He treated it as a mass.

254
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,502
And, you know, if you listen
to a recording of it,

255
00:16:40,535 --> 00:16:44,338
you will no doubt feel
the tragedy and-and the pathos.

256
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:47,074
And of course
that, uh, interpretation

257
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:49,176
was very true for Mahler
later in life,

258
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,245
after the professional bottom
dropped out

259
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:53,313
and Alma had left him
for Gropius.

260
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:58,520
But, as I said before,
we are dealing with time.

261
00:16:58,553 --> 00:17:03,190
And this piece was not born
into aching tragedy.

262
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:05,527
It was born into young love.

263
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,762
And so you chose...

264
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:09,396
Love.

265
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:12,432
Right, but precisely how long?

266
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:13,768
Well...

267
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:15,803
seven minutes.

268
00:17:19,841 --> 00:17:22,844
I was so taken
by what you said to Adam

269
00:17:22,877 --> 00:17:26,280
about, um, interpretation

270
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:29,684
and specifically about feelings,

271
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:32,152
and that you chose love.

272
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,489
And I know it's said
that you should leave the tears

273
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:37,559
for the audience, but...

274
00:17:37,592 --> 00:17:40,394
do you ever find yourself
overwhelmed by emotion

275
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:42,162
when you're up there
at the podium?

276
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:44,097
Yes.

277
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:45,867
Yes, that does happen.

278
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,169
There's an...
an expectation-reward cycle

279
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:51,271
with some works
and the spots in them

280
00:17:51,305 --> 00:17:54,207
that I find so incredible,
that when I'm conducting,

281
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:56,544
it's not that
I'm rushing exactly,

282
00:17:56,578 --> 00:17:59,313
but, oh, I just can't wait
to get to that spot,

283
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:01,683
and, yeah, it does it.
It does it every time.

284
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,319
So it's physical
as well as emotional.

285
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:07,321
-Hmm. Hmm.
-God, it must take hours

286
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:09,524
to come back down to earth.

287
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:12,894
You say things after others
remember, but you won't.

288
00:18:12,927 --> 00:18:15,295
And sleep, it's impossible.

289
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:17,397
It's like my freshman year
at Smith.

290
00:18:20,635 --> 00:18:22,469
Which piece does that to you?

291
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:23,838
Oh, I saw you.

292
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,239
I saw you conduct, uh,
<i>The Rite of Spring</i>

293
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:27,642
at the Met last year.

294
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:29,744
It was so powerful.

295
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:31,879
Thank you. Thank you.

296
00:18:31,913 --> 00:18:34,882
It's...
It's the 11 pistol shots--

297
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,383
it's a prime number--

298
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,786
that strike you as both victim
and perpetrator.

299
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,454
You know, it's not until
I conducted it

300
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:44,224
that I became convinced
we're all capable of murder.

301
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:46,861
That is a fantastic handbag,
by the way.

302
00:18:46,894 --> 00:18:49,496
Thank you.
I'm glad you like it.

303
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,198
Oh, I do. I do.

304
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:52,900
Sorry.
Your lunch with Mr. Kaplan.

305
00:18:52,934 --> 00:18:54,702
His driver is waiting.

306
00:18:54,736 --> 00:18:55,903
All right.

307
00:18:55,937 --> 00:18:57,237
I-I'm sorry,
I've forgotten your name.

308
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,740
-Whitney. Whitney Reese.
-Whitney.

309
00:18:58,773 --> 00:18:59,841
Whitney, of course.

310
00:18:59,874 --> 00:19:01,441
I'm, I'm so sorry,

311
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:03,210
and unfortunately
I've left things a bit late

312
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:04,512
-and there's something
I can't get out of. -Oh.

313
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:05,647
I understand.

314
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,215
Can I text you?

315
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,469
It's perfect, Aldo.

316
00:19:31,973 --> 00:19:34,575
Oh. I was hoping
we could celebrate.

317
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:36,678
No. So was I.

318
00:19:36,711 --> 00:19:38,412
I've got a class at Juilliard.

319
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:39,547
Oh, good.

320
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,782
I promised Ben.

321
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:44,585
I'm sure you'll have a few
elbowing for an Accordion slot.

322
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:48,288
We should open up
the fellowship.

323
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:50,558
-What, expand our numbers?
-No, our sex.

324
00:19:50,591 --> 00:19:53,828
I mean, it feels quaint
to keep things single-gender.

325
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:55,295
We've made our point.

326
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:56,931
And, honestly,
we've had no real trouble

327
00:19:56,964 --> 00:19:58,900
successfully placing
any of them.

328
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:00,835
Except one.

329
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:02,670
Oh, well.

330
00:20:02,704 --> 00:20:04,772
She had issues.

331
00:20:04,806 --> 00:20:06,473
So I've heard.

332
00:20:06,507 --> 00:20:08,576
The topic comes up
in every Citibank meeting

333
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:10,912
with her father.

334
00:20:10,945 --> 00:20:12,580
I'm sorry about that.

335
00:20:12,613 --> 00:20:13,748
It's fine.

336
00:20:13,781 --> 00:20:15,917
It's nothing I can't handle.

337
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:21,354
So, you want to torpedo
Accordion's founding principle?

338
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,390
We'd likely lose donors.

339
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,860
Yeah, I suppose that's true.

340
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:27,929
M-Maybe it's something
we revisit

341
00:20:27,962 --> 00:20:29,931
-down the line.
-Sure.

342
00:20:29,964 --> 00:20:32,533
Now, Bryant Park's locked
for the 25th.

343
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,602
Nan asked me
to help fill the place,

344
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:36,470
so the Kaplan Fund
is gonna buy some radio

345
00:20:36,504 --> 00:20:38,606
and outdoor advertising.

346
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:40,742
And claqueurs.

347
00:20:40,775 --> 00:20:42,009
It's too big, Eliot.

348
00:20:42,043 --> 00:20:43,644
She should have booked
the Strand.

349
00:20:43,678 --> 00:20:44,912
Relax.

350
00:20:44,946 --> 00:20:47,314
It'll be great.

351
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:49,650
And it almost falls
on your birthday.

352
00:20:51,586 --> 00:20:53,988
I was, uh, I was sorry
you weren't able to make it

353
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:56,256
to my Mahler Three in London.

354
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:58,693
Me, too.

355
00:20:59,961 --> 00:21:02,530
Uh, Petra had a school thing.

356
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:07,267
Uh, and I promised Sharon
I'd be there.

357
00:21:08,102 --> 00:21:10,370
Of course.

358
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:13,574
I was just hoping
for your honest opinion.

359
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:16,476
My player rating sheets
were off the charts.

360
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:18,445
Those are confidential, Eliot.

361
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:20,715
Well, the principal oboist
is a big fan.

362
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,383
On the way back,

363
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,052
I was listening to yours
with the Israeli Phil,

364
00:21:25,086 --> 00:21:27,054
and I was struck
by what you managed to pull

365
00:21:27,088 --> 00:21:29,524
from the strings
in the last movement.

366
00:21:29,557 --> 00:21:33,027
I mean, how did you
get them there?

367
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,662
Was it the hall?

368
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:36,363
Was it the players?

369
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:39,399
The players weren't
very obliging.

370
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:41,002
The principal violinist
came up to me

371
00:21:41,035 --> 00:21:42,402
after the first rehearsal

372
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,539
-and asked if I was a Jew.
-What?

373
00:21:44,572 --> 00:21:47,508
It seemed to him unusual, if
not suspicious, that a non-Jew

374
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:50,578
would be interested
in conducting Jewish music.

375
00:21:50,611 --> 00:21:53,581
Felt like Max Bruch.

376
00:21:53,614 --> 00:21:56,951
Well, big Jew that I am,
the Kaplan Fund has, uh,

377
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:58,953
committed a sizable
amount to them

378
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:00,655
-for a klezmer commission.
-Mm-hmm.

379
00:22:00,688 --> 00:22:02,657
Uh, maybe they'll invite me
to guest conduct.

380
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,692
Oh, well, they'd be lucky
to have you.

381
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:06,627
Oh, please.

382
00:22:06,661 --> 00:22:08,596
I know my place.

383
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:11,331
Money can't always
buy you everything.

384
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:14,467
You don't really believe that.

385
00:22:14,502 --> 00:22:16,571
I'll have you know
I tried to bribe Francesca

386
00:22:16,604 --> 00:22:18,139
to let me look at your notation.

387
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:19,807
She sent me packing.

388
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:21,441
Good girl.

389
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:24,011
That gentleman sitting
over there with the gnome

390
00:22:24,045 --> 00:22:26,514
is urgently focused
on our table.

391
00:22:26,547 --> 00:22:29,717
At first, I thought
he was looking at me,

392
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,953
but I think he's got
his eye on you.

393
00:22:31,986 --> 00:22:33,855
Please try and ignore him.

394
00:22:33,888 --> 00:22:36,057
I can excuse myself
and go wash my hands

395
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,859
if you'd like to be alone.

396
00:22:37,892 --> 00:22:40,761
And I would never forgive you.

397
00:22:40,795 --> 00:22:42,964
The last thing I need
is to be buttonholed in here

398
00:22:42,997 --> 00:22:44,932
by someone exactly like me.

399
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:48,536
Uh, what time are you
leaving tomorrow?

400
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:51,806
Francesca's looking
into flights.

401
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,074
Well, call her off.

402
00:22:53,107 --> 00:22:54,942
Leave when you like.

403
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,744
You don't have to do that.

404
00:22:56,777 --> 00:23:00,615
My motives are not entirely
altruistic.

405
00:23:00,648 --> 00:23:03,050
Just one peek. One peek
at your performing score.

406
00:23:05,887 --> 00:23:07,454
Fine.

407
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:10,558
-Would 5:15 be okay?
-Sure.

408
00:23:10,591 --> 00:23:13,527
Okay, I mean, I do... I have
to get turned around fast.

409
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:15,796
We're filling a vacant position.

410
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,932
Oh, please tell me
it's Sebastian.

411
00:23:17,965 --> 00:23:19,432
Now, be fair, Eliot.

412
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:21,802
Sebastian has decent technique.

413
00:23:21,836 --> 00:23:23,137
He has baton.

414
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,739
A month ago,
I dropped into Bunkamura

415
00:23:24,772 --> 00:23:27,909
to watch the Turing machine
trot out Chopin One.

416
00:23:27,942 --> 00:23:31,545
Ol' Sebastian really
is Mr. Tempo Rubato.

417
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:33,114
Robot-o is more like it.

418
00:23:33,147 --> 00:23:34,582
Why do you keep him on?

419
00:23:34,615 --> 00:23:36,851
Oh, he's Andris's man,
you know that.

420
00:23:36,884 --> 00:23:38,653
Exactly. You inherited
that decision.

421
00:23:38,686 --> 00:23:40,655
Seven years is a long time
to pretend you respect it.

422
00:23:40,688 --> 00:23:42,957
They have different
labor contracts over there.

423
00:23:45,192 --> 00:23:48,229
He's a... he's a strange guy.

424
00:23:48,262 --> 00:23:49,830
Who? Andris?

425
00:23:49,864 --> 00:23:51,832
No, Sebastian.

426
00:23:51,866 --> 00:23:54,201
He has, uh, fetishes.

427
00:23:54,235 --> 00:23:56,203
Fetishes? Like what?

428
00:23:56,237 --> 00:23:59,974
Nostalgia for prewar Kalmus
miniature scores,

429
00:24:00,007 --> 00:24:01,943
dead-stock pencils he's seen

430
00:24:01,976 --> 00:24:03,978
von Karajan hold in photographs.

431
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:05,947
You know, that sort of thing.

432
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,448
That's just sad.

433
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,956
Yeah, but you're not wrong.

434
00:24:14,989 --> 00:24:17,992
I am gonna have to rotate him
at some point.

435
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:22,730
For who?

436
00:24:27,001 --> 00:24:28,636
<i>What Love Teaches Me.</i>

437
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:30,871
That string notation.

438
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:34,608
Mahler gives it to you himself.

439
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:38,245
-Come on.
-Trust me.

440
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:39,847
You do not want to go to school

441
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,283
on someone else's
red and blue pencil.

442
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:43,985
Least of all, mine.

443
00:24:44,018 --> 00:24:45,586
Oh, but I do.

444
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:46,921
All right.
Will you quit pestering me?

445
00:24:46,954 --> 00:24:48,990
Yes.

446
00:24:49,023 --> 00:24:51,025
Free bowing.

447
00:24:52,593 --> 00:24:54,895
It's not pretty
for an audience to look at,

448
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:56,597
but if you can manage
to keep your players

449
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,532
out of the weeds...

450
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,569
... the sound's ferocious.

451
00:25:03,037 --> 00:25:04,972
Oh.

452
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:11,545
There's no glory
for a robot, Eliot.

453
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:17,051
Do your own thing.

454
00:25:19,153 --> 00:25:21,555
Hmm.

455
00:25:39,306 --> 00:25:41,942
All right, um...

456
00:25:41,976 --> 00:25:44,645
Let's... stop here.

457
00:25:44,678 --> 00:25:46,313
-Thank you, Max. Very good.
-Thanks.

458
00:25:46,347 --> 00:25:51,285
Um, just for my own
edification...

459
00:25:51,318 --> 00:25:53,654
why did you come to Juilliard?

460
00:25:56,891 --> 00:25:59,126
Uh, it's the best music
conservatory in the country?

461
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,229
People from Curtis, Eastman,
and others may beg to differ.

462
00:26:02,263 --> 00:26:04,799
I mean,
Juilliard's a brand, right?

463
00:26:04,832 --> 00:26:07,668
So, did you come to study
with a brand?

464
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:09,904
-No. -No, right.
So there's a teacher

465
00:26:09,937 --> 00:26:12,239
or graduate somewhere
down the line who, you know,

466
00:26:12,273 --> 00:26:13,841
conjured something
in your imagination.

467
00:26:13,874 --> 00:26:16,143
-Someone you aspire
to be yourself. -Mm-hmm.

468
00:26:16,177 --> 00:26:17,945
So, who was that?

469
00:26:17,978 --> 00:26:19,346
Sarah Chang.

470
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,282
Hmm. So you're a violinist?

471
00:26:21,315 --> 00:26:23,084
-Yeah.
-All right, okay.

472
00:26:23,117 --> 00:26:24,785
Well, I can see why

473
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:27,354
you would choose to conduct
a piece like this.

474
00:26:27,388 --> 00:26:29,890
Must be a familiar pleasure
in presiding over

475
00:26:29,924 --> 00:26:32,760
a bed of strings that behave
as if they're tuning.

476
00:26:32,793 --> 00:26:34,728
Now...

477
00:26:34,762 --> 00:26:39,233
this piece is very au courant.

478
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:41,836
I mean, here,
the composer tells us

479
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:43,971
to begin with "back-and-forth
tremolo strokes

480
00:26:44,004 --> 00:26:48,008
with wire brush and slowly
sliding crotales over skin."

481
00:26:48,042 --> 00:26:50,678
Sounds like René Redzepi's
recipe for reindeer.

482
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:54,982
It's exciting to play
new music, isn't it?

483
00:26:55,015 --> 00:26:56,050
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

484
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:59,753
Great. All right, please,
join the other fellows.

485
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:04,692
Now, I know you're all
conducting students

486
00:27:04,725 --> 00:27:07,294
of, uh, Mr. Wolfe's,
but how many of you

487
00:27:07,328 --> 00:27:10,664
are also studying composition?

488
00:27:10,698 --> 00:27:12,133
Right, what's your name?

489
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:13,701
Olive Kerr.

490
00:27:13,734 --> 00:27:16,137
All right, Olive. Uh...

491
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,739
What do you make of what
we've just been listening to?

492
00:27:18,772 --> 00:27:20,741
It's pretty awesome.

493
00:27:20,774 --> 00:27:23,811
I mean, there's incredible
atonal tension.

494
00:27:23,844 --> 00:27:26,080
I agree about the tension part.

495
00:27:26,113 --> 00:27:29,984
Now, you can intellectually
contemplate, or masturbate,

496
00:27:30,017 --> 00:27:33,921
about the felicity
of the so-called "atonal,"

497
00:27:33,954 --> 00:27:39,460
but the important question here
is: What are you conducting?

498
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:40,895
What is the effect?

499
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:43,898
What is it actually doing to me?

500
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:47,801
Good music can be
as ornate as a cathedral

501
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:50,004
or bare as a potting shed

502
00:27:50,037 --> 00:27:53,407
so long as it allows you to
answer both those questions.

503
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,776
Max.

504
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:58,078
Come on, what do you think?

505
00:28:01,015 --> 00:28:05,920
When... Anna Thorvaldsdóttir
gave her master class,

506
00:28:05,953 --> 00:28:09,957
she said she was often
influenced by the form

507
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:15,362
and structure of landscapes
and nature she grew up within.

508
00:28:15,396 --> 00:28:17,865
But I'm not sure
she was interested per se

509
00:28:17,898 --> 00:28:21,135
in, uh, describing
those actual sounds.

510
00:28:21,168 --> 00:28:23,804
Very <i>Punkt Kontra Punkt.</i>

511
00:28:24,972 --> 00:28:26,173
Yes.

512
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:31,212
The intent of her composition
is vague, to say the least.

513
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:36,150
So, if her intent is vague,
how do you, as a conductor,

514
00:28:36,183 --> 00:28:39,820
have a point of view
about anything?

515
00:28:39,853 --> 00:28:41,288
Now, to be fair, I mean,

516
00:28:41,322 --> 00:28:43,924
there are times when you will
simply have no choice.

517
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:46,327
And you will be made to stand
in front of an orchestra

518
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,763
and pretend that there are
these invisible structures.

519
00:28:49,797 --> 00:28:52,833
But my prayer for you

520
00:28:52,866 --> 00:28:55,002
is that you will be spared
the embarrassment

521
00:28:55,035 --> 00:28:57,238
of standing on the podium
with a 4'33",

522
00:28:57,271 --> 00:28:59,974
trying to sell a car
without an engine.

523
00:29:00,007 --> 00:29:02,243
Because now, my friends,

524
00:29:02,276 --> 00:29:05,412
now is the time to conduct music

525
00:29:05,446 --> 00:29:08,882
that actually requires
something of you.

526
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:10,384
You know,
music that everybody knows

527
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:15,122
but will hear differently
when you interpret it for them.

528
00:29:15,155 --> 00:29:19,026
For instance, Max,
why not a Kyrie?

529
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:24,198
You know, like, uh, something
like Bach's <i>Mass in B minor.</i>

530
00:29:25,866 --> 00:29:27,801
I'm not really into Bach.

531
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:30,404
-You're not into Bach?
-Mm-hmm.

532
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:32,306
Oh, Max.

533
00:29:33,207 --> 00:29:35,376
Have you read
the Schweitzer book?

534
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:37,177
No.

535
00:29:37,211 --> 00:29:38,546
Well, you should.

536
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,015
It's an important text.

537
00:29:41,048 --> 00:29:43,350
Now, Antonia Brico thought so.

538
00:29:43,384 --> 00:29:46,287
So much so that she shipped
herself to Equatorial Africa

539
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,156
and canoed up the Congo River
to track Schweitzer down

540
00:29:49,189 --> 00:29:52,293
and ask him to teach her
what he knew about Bach.

541
00:29:52,326 --> 00:29:54,295
I mean, somewhere,
I've got a picture of her

542
00:29:54,328 --> 00:29:56,497
in a, in a pith helmet.

543
00:29:56,531 --> 00:29:58,065
I mean, have you...

544
00:29:58,098 --> 00:30:02,102
have you ever played
or-or conducted Bach?

545
00:30:02,136 --> 00:30:07,841
Honestly, as a BIPOC,
pangender person,

546
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:09,577
I would say Bach's
misogynistic life

547
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:12,580
makes it kind of impossible
for me

548
00:30:12,614 --> 00:30:15,149
to take his music seriously.

549
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:18,252
Come on.

550
00:30:18,285 --> 00:30:21,221
What do... what do...
what do you mean by that?

551
00:30:21,255 --> 00:30:25,359
Well, didn't he sire,
like, 20 kids?

552
00:30:25,392 --> 00:30:27,494
Yes, that's documented.

553
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:31,165
Along with a considerable
amount of music.

554
00:30:31,198 --> 00:30:33,635
But I'm sorry,
I'm... I'm unclear

555
00:30:33,668 --> 00:30:36,337
as to what his prodigious
skills in the marital bed

556
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:39,473
have to do with B minor.

557
00:30:39,507 --> 00:30:41,041
Sure.

558
00:30:41,075 --> 00:30:43,944
All right, whatever.
That's-that's your choice.

559
00:30:43,977 --> 00:30:46,648
I mean, after all, "a soul
selects her own society."

560
00:30:46,681 --> 00:30:49,517
But remember, the flip side
of that selection

561
00:30:49,551 --> 00:30:52,353
closes the valves
of one's attention.

562
00:30:52,386 --> 00:30:56,957
Now, of course,
siloing what is acceptable

563
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:00,127
or not acceptable
is a basic construct of many,

564
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,630
if not most,
symphony orchestras today,

565
00:31:02,664 --> 00:31:04,566
who see it
as their imperial right

566
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:06,367
to curate for the cretins.

567
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,235
So, slippery as it is,

568
00:31:08,268 --> 00:31:12,106
there is some merit
in examining Max's allergy.

569
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:15,309
Can classical music
written by a bunch of straight,

570
00:31:15,342 --> 00:31:18,646
Austro-German, churchgoing
white guys exalt us,

571
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,148
individually
as-as well as collectively,

572
00:31:21,181 --> 00:31:25,185
and who, may I ask,
gets to decide that?

573
00:31:26,186 --> 00:31:28,556
You know, what about Beethoven?

574
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,525
You into him?

575
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:33,260
Because for me,
as a U-Haul lesbian,

576
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:36,497
I'm... I'm not too sure
about old Ludwig.

577
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:41,068
But then, I face him.

578
00:31:41,101 --> 00:31:43,270
And I find myself nose-to-nose

579
00:31:43,303 --> 00:31:47,975
with his magnitude
and inevitability.

580
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:53,147
Come on, Max. Indulge me.

581
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:56,551
Let's allow Bach a similar gaze.

582
00:32:01,288 --> 00:32:02,923
Sit.

583
00:32:05,593 --> 00:32:08,429
Now, this is all
filigree, right?

584
00:32:08,462 --> 00:32:13,300
I mean, it could be
a first-year piano student.

585
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:18,071
♪ Or Schroeder playing
for Lucy. ♪

586
00:32:20,007 --> 00:32:22,342
Or Glenn Gould, for that matter.

587
00:32:27,014 --> 00:32:29,416
Now, it's not until
it changes...

588
00:32:30,585 --> 00:32:32,085
... when you get inside it,

589
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,588
that you hear what it really is.

590
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:35,389
It's a question.

591
00:32:37,725 --> 00:32:39,993
And an answer.

592
00:32:41,495 --> 00:32:44,198
Which begs another question.

593
00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:48,469
There's a humility in Bach.

594
00:32:48,503 --> 00:32:52,439
He's not pretending
he's certain about anything.

595
00:32:52,473 --> 00:32:55,577
'Cause he knows
that it's always the question

596
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:58,613
that involves the listener.

597
00:32:58,646 --> 00:33:01,716
It's never the answer, right?

598
00:33:01,749 --> 00:33:05,319
Now, the big question
for you is:

599
00:33:05,352 --> 00:33:07,789
What do you think, Max?

600
00:33:13,661 --> 00:33:15,630
You play really well.

601
00:33:15,663 --> 00:33:22,069
But nowadays, white, male, cis
composers, just not my thing.

602
00:33:22,102 --> 00:33:26,273
Don't be so eager
to be offended.

603
00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:28,408
The narcissism
of small differences

604
00:33:28,442 --> 00:33:31,245
leads to the most boring
conformity.

605
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:33,280
I guess Edgard Varèse is okay.

606
00:33:33,313 --> 00:33:35,249
I mean, I like "Arcana," anyway.

607
00:33:35,282 --> 00:33:38,285
Oh, well, then you must be
aware that Varèse

608
00:33:38,318 --> 00:33:40,522
once famously stated that jazz

609
00:33:40,555 --> 00:33:45,125
was "a Negro product
exploited by the Jews."

610
00:33:45,158 --> 00:33:47,662
Didn't stop Jerry Goldsmith
from ripping him off

611
00:33:47,695 --> 00:33:49,797
for his
<i>Planet of the Apes</i> score.

612
00:33:49,831 --> 00:33:52,366
It's kind of a perfect insult,
don't you think?

613
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:56,169
But you see, the problem
with enrolling yourself

614
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:58,573
as an ultrasonic epistemic
dissident

615
00:33:58,606 --> 00:34:02,342
is that if Bach's talent
can be reduced to his gender,

616
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:05,547
birth country, religion,
sexuality, and so on,

617
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,248
then so can yours.

618
00:34:08,282 --> 00:34:11,553
Now, someday, Max,
when you go out into the world

619
00:34:11,586 --> 00:34:15,389
and you guest conduct
for a major or minor orchestra,

620
00:34:15,422 --> 00:34:18,526
you may notice that the players
have more than light bulbs

621
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,128
and music on their stands.

622
00:34:21,161 --> 00:34:24,264
They will also have been
handed rating sheets,

623
00:34:24,298 --> 00:34:27,267
the purpose of which
is to rate you.

624
00:34:27,301 --> 00:34:29,537
Now, what kind of criteria

625
00:34:29,571 --> 00:34:32,306
would you hope that they would
use to do this?

626
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:35,543
Your score reading and stick
technique, or something else?

627
00:34:38,445 --> 00:34:41,883
All right, everyone,
using Max's criteria,

628
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:44,719
let's consider Max's thing.

629
00:34:44,752 --> 00:34:47,454
In this case,
Anna Thorvaldsdóttir.

630
00:34:47,487 --> 00:34:51,291
Now, can we agree on two pieces
of observation?

631
00:34:51,325 --> 00:34:53,861
One, that Anna was born
in Iceland.

632
00:34:53,895 --> 00:34:56,330
And two, that she is,
in a, I don't know,

633
00:34:56,363 --> 00:34:58,766
Waldorf teacher kinda way,
a superhot young woman.

634
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,802
Show of hands.

635
00:35:00,835 --> 00:35:03,136
All right,
now let's turn our gaze

636
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:05,205
back to the piano bench up there

637
00:35:05,238 --> 00:35:08,408
and see if we can square
how any of those things

638
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:12,680
possibly relate to the person
we see seated before us.

639
00:35:17,552 --> 00:35:19,353
Oh, where are you going?

640
00:35:22,857 --> 00:35:24,491
You're a fucking bitch.

641
00:35:25,793 --> 00:35:27,929
And you are a robot.

642
00:35:27,962 --> 00:35:30,632
I mean, unfortunately,
the architect of your soul

643
00:35:30,665 --> 00:35:33,367
appears to be social media.

644
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,638
You want to dance the mask,
you must service the composer.

645
00:35:36,671 --> 00:35:37,905
You gotta sublimate yourself,

646
00:35:37,939 --> 00:35:40,808
your ego, and, yes,
your identity.

647
00:35:40,842 --> 00:35:43,645
You must, in fact, stand
in front of the public and God

648
00:35:43,678 --> 00:35:46,413
and obliterate yourself.

649
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:50,384
All right.

650
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:51,919
During the lockdown,

651
00:35:51,953 --> 00:35:54,287
you did something
I thought remarkable.

652
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:55,923
You made music for free.

653
00:35:55,957 --> 00:35:58,693
Anyone at all could stream
Berlin performances

654
00:35:58,726 --> 00:36:01,194
without ever paying a dime.

655
00:36:01,228 --> 00:36:03,296
Well, that-that was a...

656
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:06,466
it's a democratically made
decision by the players.

657
00:36:06,501 --> 00:36:10,638
And though I-I wish I could
claim the idea was mine,

658
00:36:10,672 --> 00:36:14,307
it really did spring from
the heart of Sharon Goodnow.

659
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:15,777
Sharon is your partner.

660
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,244
You have a child together,

661
00:36:17,277 --> 00:36:19,681
and she's also the
concertmaster for Berlin.

662
00:36:19,714 --> 00:36:21,816
-Does that ever...
-Yes, that's right.

663
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:23,518
... complicate things for you?

664
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:25,687
Your work getting into your
home or the other way ar...?

665
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:40,702
Jake said he was certain

666
00:36:40,735 --> 00:36:42,704
you'd be happy with the drape
of the seat.

667
00:36:42,737 --> 00:36:44,304
I will be...

668
00:36:44,337 --> 00:36:46,574
... if I can keep the fat off
until next month.

669
00:36:46,607 --> 00:36:49,476
You never gain weight.

670
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,016
Your... your mother texted me.

671
00:36:55,049 --> 00:36:57,652
She knows you're busy
but is hoping to drop by.

672
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,588
Next trip.

673
00:37:00,621 --> 00:37:02,890
What are you thinking
for dinner?

674
00:37:02,924 --> 00:37:04,625
Uh, no.

675
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:07,528
No, I'm-I'm gonna stay in
and put this piano to good use.

676
00:37:07,562 --> 00:37:11,331
I'm suspicious of the E natural
in the cello line.

677
00:37:11,364 --> 00:37:14,602
Doesn't it sound like
warmed-over Charles Ives to you?

678
00:37:14,635 --> 00:37:16,403
Not-not at all.

679
00:37:16,436 --> 00:37:18,405
But don't worry,
I'll call Houston.

680
00:37:18,438 --> 00:37:19,741
They'll be flexible.

681
00:37:19,774 --> 00:37:22,476
You must have
some New Haven friends

682
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,612
you want to see tonight?

683
00:37:24,645 --> 00:37:26,848
No. Not really.

684
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:31,753
Should I stop by later
for notes?

685
00:37:31,786 --> 00:37:33,755
No, that won't be necessary.

686
00:37:33,788 --> 00:37:36,657
Okay.

687
00:37:39,026 --> 00:37:44,532
Oh, I, I-I almost forgot, but...

688
00:37:44,565 --> 00:37:47,535
this was left for you
at the front desk.

689
00:37:47,568 --> 00:37:48,669
By who?

690
00:37:48,703 --> 00:37:50,671
They didn't say.

691
00:37:50,705 --> 00:37:52,540
Wh-What, no card?

692
00:37:52,573 --> 00:37:53,406
No.

693
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,710
Okay, just, just leave it
over there.

694
00:37:55,743 --> 00:37:56,878
Thanks.

695
00:38:07,722 --> 00:38:08,923
Good night.

696
00:38:08,956 --> 00:38:10,591
Night.

697
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:20,067
You're listening to

698
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:22,570
<i>All Things Considered</i>
from NPR News.

699
00:38:22,603 --> 00:38:24,337
<i>All Things Considered</i>
is brought to you

00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:25,740
by the Corporation

... and <i>I Eat Ears,</i>

703
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:32,079
-feeding the discerning
listener since 2008. -2008.

704
00:38:32,113 --> 00:38:33,614

<i>-I Eat Ears,</i>

705
00:38:33,648 --> 00:38:35,850
-and you should, too.
-and you should, too.

706
00:38:36,717 --> 00:38:40,021
And now, more from NPR.

707
00:38:40,054 --> 00:38:41,522
Over the next few weeks,

708
00:38:41,556 --> 00:38:43,624
we'll be hearing poems
from four finalists

709
00:38:43,658 --> 00:38:47,427
for the National
Youth Poet Laureate Award.

710
00:38:55,036 --> 00:38:57,505
When were you informed of this?

711
00:38:57,538 --> 00:39:00,107
Just this morning.

712
00:39:00,141 --> 00:39:02,510
Mr. Kaplan was very apologetic.

713
00:39:02,543 --> 00:39:03,845
I was able to get us on

714
00:39:03,878 --> 00:39:05,580
the 7:00 a.m. you like,
through Munich.

715
00:39:05,613 --> 00:39:06,714
The connection's short,

716
00:39:06,747 --> 00:39:08,850
but special services
are standing by.

717
00:39:08,883 --> 00:39:10,718
Where are things with DG?

718
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:13,420
Please tell me they've finally
woken up to see the wisdom

719
00:39:13,453 --> 00:39:15,723
of honest-to-God LPs
for this release?

720
00:39:15,756 --> 00:39:17,792
No movement there yet.

721
00:39:17,825 --> 00:39:19,594
Have you looked at the email
I drafted for you?

722
00:39:19,627 --> 00:39:20,928
-Sent it last night.
-Mm-hmm.

723
00:39:20,962 --> 00:39:23,764
-Well, just forward me
their response. -Mm-hmm.

724
00:39:24,765 --> 00:39:27,802
What's your take
on <i>The New Yorker</i> talk?

725
00:39:29,103 --> 00:39:30,538
It went well, I thought.

726
00:39:30,571 --> 00:39:32,139
Oh. You're hedging.

727
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:34,976
I was garrulous.

728
00:39:35,009 --> 00:39:36,443
No.

729
00:39:36,476 --> 00:39:38,478
No, not at all.
You, you were fabulous.

730
00:39:38,512 --> 00:39:40,815
Francesca.

731
00:39:40,848 --> 00:39:43,551
If you have any real interest
in conducting,

732
00:39:43,584 --> 00:39:45,485
you need to be able
to speak your mind.

733
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:47,588
Okay. Perhaps you...

734
00:39:47,622 --> 00:39:49,924
You could've made less
of the relationship with...

735
00:39:49,957 --> 00:39:51,559
-Lenny?
-No.

736
00:39:51,592 --> 00:39:53,861
I-I was thinking
about Mahler and Alma's.

737
00:39:53,895 --> 00:39:55,763
-Oh. Huh. -You implied
that she betrayed him.

738
00:39:55,796 --> 00:39:59,000
I'm not, I'm not sure
I agree with that.

739
00:39:59,033 --> 00:40:00,534
Oh, really?

740
00:40:00,568 --> 00:40:02,103
Alma was a composer, too,

741
00:40:02,136 --> 00:40:04,437
but he insisted
she stop writing music.

742
00:40:04,471 --> 00:40:05,973
He said there was
only room for...

743
00:40:06,007 --> 00:40:08,175
-One asshole in the house?
-One asshole in the house. Yes.

744
00:40:08,209 --> 00:40:10,044
And she agreed to those rules.

745
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:12,445
No one made that decision
for her.

746
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:15,516
#RulesOfTheGame.

747
00:40:18,886 --> 00:40:21,421
Okay.

748
00:40:28,495 --> 00:40:29,864
How was your evening?

749
00:40:29,897 --> 00:40:32,233
Yeah, was uneventful.

750
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:34,735
Are there any
of Sharon's pills left?

751
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:37,838
No, but Dr. Korovin
called these in.

752
00:40:37,872 --> 00:40:40,473
Ah, thanks.

753
00:40:47,715 --> 00:40:50,651
I received another weird email
from Krista.

754
00:40:50,685 --> 00:40:54,155
-Mm-hmm.
-How should I reply?

755
00:40:54,188 --> 00:40:55,923
Don't.

756
00:40:57,591 --> 00:41:00,928
Well, this one felt
especially desperate.

757
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:03,851
Do you have some kind
of profit-sharing deal

758
00:43:03,884 --> 00:43:06,320
with the utility company
that I am unaware of?

759
00:43:08,322 --> 00:43:10,958
The flutter's back.

760
00:43:10,991 --> 00:43:14,261
It's... It's racing.

761
00:43:14,295 --> 00:43:16,697
I can't find my Metoprolol
anywhere.

762
00:43:21,068 --> 00:43:22,736
Oh, fuck.

763
00:43:34,415 --> 00:43:38,152
Uh, I found this
lying loose in the drawer.

764
00:43:40,688 --> 00:43:42,957
Is this the right one?

765
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:45,960
Yeah.

766
00:43:50,931 --> 00:43:52,900
Thank you.

767
00:43:56,036 --> 00:43:58,139
Is that a new bag?

768
00:43:58,172 --> 00:44:00,441
Oh, it's just a gift from Eliot.

769
00:44:00,474 --> 00:44:01,976
You want it?

770
00:44:02,009 --> 00:44:03,644
No.

771
00:44:04,712 --> 00:44:06,147
Suits you.

772
00:44:07,982 --> 00:44:13,754
Let's slow this down
to 60 beats a minute.

773
00:44:37,745 --> 00:44:39,446
Actually, it's 64 beats.

774
00:44:44,018 --> 00:44:47,188
Tried calling you
on your mobile last night.

775
00:44:47,221 --> 00:44:48,923
Hmm.

776
00:44:48,956 --> 00:44:51,859
And again at the hotel.

777
00:44:51,892 --> 00:44:54,228
Must've been asleep.

778
00:44:55,329 --> 00:44:57,198
You never sleep that deeply.

779
00:44:57,231 --> 00:44:59,400
No, no, don't be a scold.

780
00:44:59,433 --> 00:45:03,170
♪ Feelin' a feelin' ♪

781
00:45:04,238 --> 00:45:10,844
♪ For somethin' there ain't
too much of... ♪

782
00:45:11,478 --> 00:45:13,747
I'm worried about Petra.

783
00:45:16,016 --> 00:45:19,186
She's starting to disappear
into herself.

784
00:45:20,354 --> 00:45:22,189
Be specific.

785
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:28,829
She keeps coming home
with bruises on her shins.

786
00:45:29,863 --> 00:45:33,033
And then when I ask her
about it, she gets quiet.

787
00:45:34,868 --> 00:45:37,371
I mean, I hope
it's just playground football

788
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:40,241
and not some <i>Biodeutsche</i> thing.

789
00:45:40,274 --> 00:45:43,077
Hmm, we talked about this.

790
00:45:44,278 --> 00:45:47,414
But maybe we just need
to put more effort

791
00:45:47,448 --> 00:45:50,384
into finding her a friend.

792
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,253
Last year was really hard

793
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:55,923
to be locked up alone
with two old ladies like us.

794
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:02,229
She's old enough to learn piano.

795
00:46:04,164 --> 00:46:06,033
I'll teach her.

796
00:46:10,572 --> 00:46:12,906
Yeah.

797
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,309
That might be good.

798
00:46:16,477 --> 00:46:18,879
How's your heart?

799
00:46:19,614 --> 00:46:22,016
Better now.

800
00:46:43,971 --> 00:46:47,041
Knock, knock. Who's there?

801
00:46:47,074 --> 00:46:49,443
Lenny?

802
00:46:49,476 --> 00:46:51,912
Walter?

803
00:46:51,945 --> 00:46:55,015
Oh, it's you, MTT.

804
00:46:55,049 --> 00:46:58,052
Why do you insist on holding
things up like that?

805
00:46:58,085 --> 00:46:59,887
Your business here is rejoicing,

806
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,357
not screaming
like a fucking porn star.

807
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:05,459
Michael Tilson
Thomas...

808
00:47:14,268 --> 00:47:16,236
Hello, Petra.

809
00:47:18,372 --> 00:47:21,241
Why are you lurking? Hmm?

810
00:47:22,109 --> 00:47:24,378
Tell me and I'll help.

811
00:47:25,145 --> 00:47:26,614
- Sharon?
- Hmm?

812
00:47:26,648 --> 00:47:29,116
Uh, I'm taking Petra to school.

813
00:47:29,149 --> 00:47:30,484
Oh, okay.

814
00:47:30,518 --> 00:47:33,153
-Come on.
<i>-Tschüss.</i>

815
00:47:53,073 --> 00:47:55,976
Who'll bear the pall?

816
00:47:56,009 --> 00:47:57,679
"We," said the wren,

817
00:47:57,712 --> 00:48:00,682
-"both the cock and the hen."
-The hen.

818
00:48:00,715 --> 00:48:02,617
"I'll..."

819
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:05,085
"We'll bear the pall."

820
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,954
And who'll sing a psalm?

821
00:48:06,987 --> 00:48:11,392
"I," said the thrush
as she sat on a bush.

822
00:48:11,425 --> 00:48:13,427
"I'll sing a song."

823
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,496
"Who'll toll the bell?"

824
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:16,997
"I," said the bull,

825
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:19,501
"because I can pull.

826
00:48:19,534 --> 00:48:21,034
I'll toll the bell."

827
00:48:21,068 --> 00:48:23,705
All the birds of the air

828
00:48:23,738 --> 00:48:26,974
fell a-sighing and a-sobbing

829
00:48:27,007 --> 00:48:29,977
when they heard the bell toll

830
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:34,047
for poor Cock Robin!

831
00:48:40,588 --> 00:48:43,023
It's gonna be okay.

832
00:48:47,327 --> 00:48:49,531
All right.
Okay, which one is she?

833
00:48:49,564 --> 00:48:51,932
The red one.

834
00:48:54,569 --> 00:48:56,504
-Bye.
-Go on.

835
00:49:07,582 --> 00:49:09,416
<i>Hallo,</i> Johanna.

836
00:50:03,638 --> 00:50:06,139
Hello. Hi.

837
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,649
They're all in the chamber hall?

838
00:50:14,682 --> 00:50:16,551
Yes.

839
00:50:16,584 --> 00:50:19,019
No.

840
00:50:58,693 --> 00:51:01,228
Good morning.

841
00:51:02,262 --> 00:51:04,699
Oh, I'm sorry, Maestro.

842
00:51:04,732 --> 00:51:06,501
We weren't sure you were coming.

843
00:51:06,534 --> 00:51:09,871
We were told there might be,
um, a scheduling conflict.

844
00:51:09,904 --> 00:51:11,839
- Would you like me
to take notes? -

845
00:51:11,873 --> 00:51:13,240
No, thank you, Sebastian.

846
00:51:13,273 --> 00:51:14,676
That won't be necessary.

847
00:51:14,709 --> 00:51:16,376
Do we all have
our rating sheets?

848
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:18,278
-We narrowed it down to three.
-Mm-hmm.

849
00:51:18,312 --> 00:51:20,582
So, unless anyone has
other business to discuss,

850
00:51:20,615 --> 00:51:22,550
let's bring in number one.

851
00:52:39,727 --> 00:52:42,429
Goossens stands, sounds his A.

852
00:52:42,462 --> 00:52:45,365
And of course, uh, Léon
was rather famous

853
00:52:45,399 --> 00:52:49,604
-for his, um, rather wide
vibrato, huh? -Hmm.

854
00:52:49,637 --> 00:52:53,273
Beecham looks up and says,
"Gentlemen, take your pick."

855
00:52:55,943 --> 00:52:57,945
How's the writing going?

856
00:52:57,979 --> 00:53:01,348
Ah, I never know how
to answer that question.

857
00:53:01,381 --> 00:53:02,449
No.

858
00:53:02,482 --> 00:53:04,986
Makes it sound like
a physical act.

859
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:06,954
Like, how's the shitting going?

860
00:53:08,756 --> 00:53:09,957
Okay.

861
00:53:09,991 --> 00:53:11,959
How's the thinking going?

862
00:53:11,993 --> 00:53:14,461
Yeah, not so well.

863
00:53:14,494 --> 00:53:16,964
I keep hearing something
and getting excited

864
00:53:16,998 --> 00:53:20,635
only to catch myself
in pastiche.

865
00:53:20,668 --> 00:53:22,235
Hmm.

866
00:53:22,269 --> 00:53:24,438
Uh, it's all pastiche.

867
00:53:24,471 --> 00:53:26,841
We all have the same
musical grammar.

868
00:53:26,874 --> 00:53:29,711
Uh, just look at Beethoven Five.

869
00:53:29,744 --> 00:53:32,880
The third movement's theme has
the same sequence of intervals

870
00:53:32,914 --> 00:53:36,651
as the opening theme of the
final movement of Mozart Forty.

871
00:53:36,684 --> 00:53:39,020
Mm, th-that could've been
a coincidence.

872
00:53:39,053 --> 00:53:41,022
No. Not in this case.

873
00:53:41,055 --> 00:53:43,891
If you examine
the sketchbooks he used,

874
00:53:43,925 --> 00:53:47,962
29 bars of Mozart's
finale appear.

875
00:53:47,995 --> 00:53:50,430
Copied out by Beethoven.

876
00:53:50,464 --> 00:53:54,602
Oh, my God. I find that
extremely depressing.

877
00:53:54,635 --> 00:53:56,470
I finished reading
your manuscript.

878
00:53:56,504 --> 00:53:58,271
It's very good, Lydia.

879
00:53:58,305 --> 00:54:00,340
One for the ages.

880
00:54:00,373 --> 00:54:02,577
And, I dare say,
will be available

881
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:04,311
long after my book
has been forgotten.

882
00:54:04,344 --> 00:54:05,813
Oh, yes, you're right.

883
00:54:05,847 --> 00:54:09,382
The entire first printing
will always be available.

884
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:11,619
Too modest, as usual.

885
00:54:20,327 --> 00:54:22,395
Thank you, Andris.

886
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:25,032
I'll cherish this.

887
00:54:25,066 --> 00:54:27,400
You may use it.

888
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:29,704
A-a blurb for the covers.

889
00:54:30,938 --> 00:54:33,541
Oh, thank you.

890
00:54:33,574 --> 00:54:35,543
I'll send it to the publisher.

891
00:54:35,576 --> 00:54:37,545
Hopefully, there's still time.

892
00:54:37,578 --> 00:54:39,914
I'm proud to call you my pupil,

893
00:54:39,947 --> 00:54:41,381
uh, even though there was really

894
00:54:41,414 --> 00:54:42,683
nothing I could teach you.

895
00:54:42,717 --> 00:54:43,818
Now, that's not true.

896
00:54:43,851 --> 00:54:46,954
I'd never have the position
here were it not for you.

897
00:54:46,988 --> 00:54:49,456
Then you'd be in London,
New York.

898
00:54:49,489 --> 00:54:51,491
They're not Berlin.

899
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,929
Besides, I'm not sure
what Sharon would do,

900
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:56,363
were we ever to leave.

901
00:54:56,396 --> 00:54:58,032
She's so close with her family.

902
00:54:58,065 --> 00:55:01,669
Ah, yeah, the Goodnow sisters.

903
00:55:01,702 --> 00:55:04,437
I remember the elder one
being an absolute ball-breaker

904
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:07,508
while she still held sway at DG.

905
00:55:07,542 --> 00:55:11,646
-Heike is a woman
of many opinions. -Oh.

906
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:12,479
And that voice.

907
00:55:12,513 --> 00:55:14,048
I mean, the signal-to-noise
ratio,

908
00:55:14,081 --> 00:55:16,416
it's unbearable.

909
00:55:16,449 --> 00:55:18,553
I've had to bolt-hole
at my old place in town

910
00:55:18,586 --> 00:55:21,088
to get any writing done.

911
00:55:21,122 --> 00:55:22,590
Schopenhauer measured
a man's intelligence

912
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:24,826
against his sensitivity
to noise.

913
00:55:26,527 --> 00:55:29,429
Didn't he once also throw
a woman down a flight of stairs

914
00:55:29,462 --> 00:55:30,932
who later sued him?

915
00:55:30,965 --> 00:55:32,099
Yes.

916
00:55:32,133 --> 00:55:33,734
Although, it's unclear

917
00:55:33,768 --> 00:55:35,435
this private
and personal failing

918
00:55:35,468 --> 00:55:38,072
is at all relevant to his work.

919
00:55:45,746 --> 00:55:47,782
You're late.

920
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:50,450
Here, give me your stick.

921
00:55:50,483 --> 00:55:52,086
-Thank you.
-I've got it.

922
00:59:38,412 --> 00:59:40,848
Okay. Uh...

923
00:59:42,249 --> 00:59:43,651
<i>Gut, gut.</i>

924
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,889
... Christian...

925
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,328
Okay?

926
00:59:54,361 --> 00:59:56,630
Uh, but it's also...

927
00:59:56,664 --> 00:59:57,798
It's like we're hearing it

928
00:59:57,832 --> 01:00:00,301
from a very, very great
distance.

929
01:00:00,334 --> 01:00:05,973
So it's...

930
01:00:06,006 --> 01:00:07,174
Ju... Uh...

931
01:00:07,208 --> 01:00:08,776
Sorry. <i>Ist</i> Harald <i>da?</i>

932
01:00:11,445 --> 01:00:13,714
Harald? I was just wondering
if you might, um,

933
01:00:13,747 --> 01:00:16,217
uh, quickly rig something up
for us?

934
01:00:47,314 --> 01:00:49,283
<i>Gut, gut, gut.</i>

935
01:00:49,316 --> 01:00:51,719
Harald?

936
01:00:51,752 --> 01:00:53,287
Uh, we'll want the same
backstage setup

937
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,455
for the live recording.

938
01:00:54,488 --> 01:00:56,757
One, two, one.

939
01:01:24,151 --> 01:01:27,188
Okay? Looks great, but...

940
01:01:27,221 --> 01:01:28,422
... we need to hear it.

941
01:01:28,455 --> 01:01:31,225
Okay? It's not...

942
01:01:32,893 --> 01:01:33,894
Hey.

943
01:01:41,168 --> 01:01:42,469
<i>Ja?</i>

944
01:01:42,504 --> 01:01:44,972
Okay?

945
01:01:58,252 --> 01:02:00,221
No.

946
01:02:00,254 --> 01:02:01,855
Bah!

947
01:02:02,489 --> 01:02:04,124
It's-it's much too slow.

948
01:02:12,567 --> 01:02:14,268
Mm-hmm.

949
01:02:14,301 --> 01:02:16,437
Okay.

950
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:18,205
Okay, tutti.

951
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:19,840
Uh...

952
01:02:21,842 --> 01:02:24,111
How are things feeling up here?

953
01:02:24,144 --> 01:02:25,312
Fine, yeah.

954
01:02:25,346 --> 01:02:26,981
Yeah, actually great, but, uh,

955
01:02:27,014 --> 01:02:29,250
it's a shame we don't record
this one direct-to-disk.

956
01:02:29,283 --> 01:02:32,219
Oh. It's criminal,
is more like it.

957
01:02:33,387 --> 01:02:34,989
Will you shoot me the MP3s?

958
01:02:35,022 --> 01:02:37,024
Yeah, sure,
but don't you want WAV files?

959
01:02:37,057 --> 01:02:40,394
No, just think what people
will actually be streaming.

960
01:02:40,427 --> 01:02:41,862
Uh, what about video?

961
01:02:41,895 --> 01:02:43,797
Yes, yes.
Uh, stage left A camera.

962
01:02:43,831 --> 01:02:45,165
-Okay.
-All right. Thanks, guys.

963
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:47,101
Okay. Uh, bye.
You're quite welcome.

964
01:02:49,169 --> 01:02:50,871
- There?
- Yeah.

965
01:02:50,904 --> 01:02:52,540
You want us to come,
to come in stronger there?

966
01:02:52,574 --> 01:02:54,008
- Okay, then yeah.
- Yeah.

967
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:55,543
Here, 'cause the reigning
dynamic is forte,

968
01:02:55,577 --> 01:02:57,077
which is not good.

969
01:02:57,111 --> 01:02:58,879
- Hmm.
- Yeah?

970
01:02:58,912 --> 01:03:01,949
Yeah. Um, just
one small thing, Maestro.

971
01:03:01,982 --> 01:03:04,885
During the scherzo, um,

972
01:03:04,918 --> 01:03:07,988
th-th-the clarinet solo's
still a bit too loud.

973
01:03:08,022 --> 01:03:10,024
It should really be
an accompanying figure

974
01:03:10,057 --> 01:03:13,093
- to the first violins.
- Hmm.

975
01:03:13,127 --> 01:03:16,497
But apart from that, I'd say
we're in very good shape.

976
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:18,399
Thank you, Sebastian.

977
01:03:18,432 --> 01:03:20,801
Thank you.

978
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,374
Accurate assessment?

979
01:03:27,408 --> 01:03:29,243
I don't think so.

980
01:03:29,276 --> 01:03:32,580
The clarinet is marked piano,
and we are marked pianissimo.

981
01:03:32,614 --> 01:03:34,516
Sebastian likes to sit
in the stalls,

982
01:03:34,549 --> 01:03:38,285
but there's no problem
with the balance in the circle.

983
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:40,154
Mm-hmm.

984
01:03:41,288 --> 01:03:42,856
Mm-hmm.

985
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:45,059
Something a bit more playful.

986
01:03:45,092 --> 01:03:46,360
Mm-hmm.

987
01:03:50,297 --> 01:03:52,567
Oh, and here's something
Tanya and I did with Gustavo.

988
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,234
I think it's very powerful.

989
01:03:54,268 --> 01:03:56,604
Yes, it's-it's really wonderful
work, uh, Karl.

990
01:03:56,638 --> 01:03:58,472
I'm just wondering
if we might try something

991
01:03:58,506 --> 01:04:01,408
a little less, uh, considered.

992
01:04:04,111 --> 01:04:06,480
Something simple like this?

993
01:04:06,514 --> 01:04:07,948
Hmm?

994
01:04:07,981 --> 01:04:10,351
I'm not sure how you would
want to light it.

995
01:04:10,384 --> 01:04:13,253
Have Harald dim
the houselights to half.

996
01:04:14,121 --> 01:04:16,957
Houselights down half, please.

997
01:04:20,595 --> 01:04:22,296
I mean, we could make it work,

998
01:04:22,329 --> 01:04:24,231
but we'd have to bring in
some lights.

999
01:04:24,264 --> 01:04:26,133
Mm-hmm.

1000
01:04:29,103 --> 01:04:30,938
If we want to do
something like this,

1001
01:04:30,971 --> 01:04:33,040
uh, we'll have to bring
the hot lights

1002
01:04:33,073 --> 01:04:35,109
next week, Tanya--
forget about the strobes.

1003
01:04:35,142 --> 01:04:37,344
Hmm.

1004
01:04:38,178 --> 01:04:39,581
Thank you for waiting.

1005
01:04:39,614 --> 01:04:41,248
Of course, Maestro.

1006
01:04:41,281 --> 01:04:44,318
How are we feeling
about today's rehearsal?

1007
01:04:44,351 --> 01:04:48,255
Well, Sebastian thinks
your solo in the scherzo

1008
01:04:48,288 --> 01:04:50,357
is, uh, a bit loud.

1009
01:04:50,391 --> 01:04:51,526
It's possible.

1010
01:04:51,559 --> 01:04:53,427
Hmm. I don't agree.

1011
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:56,664
Your dynamic marking is higher
than that of the first violin.

1012
01:04:56,698 --> 01:04:58,332
Yes, that's true.

1013
01:04:58,365 --> 01:05:00,033
Look.

1014
01:05:00,067 --> 01:05:03,638
Sebastian's getting old, Knut.

1015
01:05:03,671 --> 01:05:05,372
I'm rotating him out.

1016
01:05:06,373 --> 01:05:08,409
You're the first to know.

1017
01:05:11,445 --> 01:05:13,947
Well...

1018
01:05:15,449 --> 01:05:18,720
Then I will organize a caucus,
and we'll take a vote.

1019
01:05:18,753 --> 01:05:21,723
No. No, you won't.

1020
01:05:21,756 --> 01:05:24,291
A vote must be taken.

1021
01:05:24,324 --> 01:05:26,427
I am familiar with
the electoral conclave.

1022
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:28,663
But the appointment
of the assistant conductor

1023
01:05:28,696 --> 01:05:31,432
is entirely my decision.

1024
01:05:33,133 --> 01:05:34,134
Yes.

1025
01:05:34,168 --> 01:05:37,505
So, I can count on your
support with the others?

1026
01:05:39,473 --> 01:05:40,675
Yes.

1027
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:42,176
Good.

1028
01:05:42,209 --> 01:05:43,477
Who will you replace him with?

1029
01:05:43,511 --> 01:05:45,345
Oh. I'm considering a few names,

1030
01:05:45,379 --> 01:05:48,583
but the main thing is we
proceed with this immediately.

1031
01:05:48,616 --> 01:05:51,051
I understand.

1032
01:05:51,084 --> 01:05:53,220
Maestro, uh, the other players
would like to know

1033
01:05:53,253 --> 01:05:54,722
if you have chosen
the companion piece.

1034
01:05:54,756 --> 01:05:56,957

01:07:36,824 --> 01:07:40,093
I-I need someone to hold me.

1051
01:07:41,829 --> 01:07:44,464
This isn't the place, Francesca.

1052
01:07:45,867 --> 01:07:48,335
You're...
That's not about...

1053
01:07:49,571 --> 01:07:51,471
I just...

1054
01:07:51,506 --> 01:07:55,075
I just got this from someone
over at Accordion.

1055
01:08:06,754 --> 01:08:08,322
Oh, no.

1056
01:08:10,758 --> 01:08:12,627
When did this happen?

1057
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:14,629
Day before yesterday.

1058
01:08:16,396 --> 01:08:19,734
That email she sent you,
it felt like she was already...

1059
01:08:19,767 --> 01:08:22,737
Delete it. And the rest.

1060
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:26,206
There's no reason to get
caught up in any intrigue.

1061
01:08:31,378 --> 01:08:33,180
Now, now.

1062
01:08:34,481 --> 01:08:39,520
Come on. There's nothing
we could have done to stop her.

1063
01:08:39,554 --> 01:08:41,889
She wasn't one of us.

1064
01:08:57,404 --> 01:09:00,908
I can't stop thinking about
our trip up the Ucayali.

1065
01:09:00,942 --> 01:09:02,476
Hmm.

1066
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:04,512
-The three of us were so close.
-Yes.

1067
01:09:04,545 --> 01:09:08,148
But that was before
she started making demands.

1068
01:09:09,684 --> 01:09:14,689
There was just something
not quite right about her.

1069
01:09:14,722 --> 01:09:17,491
She had so much promise.

1070
01:09:17,525 --> 01:09:19,326
She did.

1071
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:20,962
Yes.

1072
01:09:20,995 --> 01:09:23,463
Almost as much as you.

1073
01:09:27,434 --> 01:09:30,672
Now, we have to forget
about her.

1074
01:09:34,307 --> 01:09:36,309
You understand?

1075
01:09:41,015 --> 01:09:43,316
Right?

1076
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,220
-I'm sorry.
-No.

1077
01:09:47,254 --> 01:09:48,690
I know you're working.

1078
01:09:48,723 --> 01:09:50,223
Oh.

1079
01:09:50,257 --> 01:09:51,559
Your...

1080
01:09:51,592 --> 01:09:54,562
Your keys are on
the kitchen table.

1081
01:10:58,793 --> 01:11:00,762
She went straight to sleep.

1082
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:05,767
Didn't even have
to hold her foot.

1083
01:11:10,505 --> 01:11:13,775
And she came home
in a much better mood.

1084
01:11:13,808 --> 01:11:15,676
Oh, attagirl.

1085
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:27,088
Met the new cellist today.

1086
01:11:27,121 --> 01:11:29,857
Oh, what was that like?

1087
01:11:29,891 --> 01:11:32,093
Olga Metkina.

1088
01:11:32,126 --> 01:11:33,928
Russian.

1089
01:11:33,961 --> 01:11:35,963
Strong player.

1090
01:11:35,997 --> 01:11:38,398
Good.

1091
01:11:38,431 --> 01:11:41,536
Her facial posture
is a bit much.

1092
01:11:41,569 --> 01:11:42,937
How so?

1093
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:44,605
Her legato.

1094
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:46,974
Looks like she's on
the verge of climaxing.

1095
01:11:51,444 --> 01:11:53,748
She is young.

1096
01:11:53,781 --> 01:11:55,583
Ah, so you've met her.

1097
01:11:57,585 --> 01:11:59,086
No, no.

1098
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,589
Uh, Francesca
mentioned something.

1099
01:12:01,622 --> 01:12:04,491
I think she's arranging
a welcome lunch.

1100
01:12:06,694 --> 01:12:09,496
You may want to hold off
on that.

1101
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:12,465
Her invitation is conditional.

1102
01:12:15,402 --> 01:12:17,939
You have reservations?

1103
01:12:17,972 --> 01:12:19,907
No.

1104
01:12:19,941 --> 01:12:22,475
Not really.

1105
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:25,345
We need to see if she fits in.

1106
01:12:28,916 --> 01:12:31,351
Did you take your pill?

1107
01:12:32,019 --> 01:12:34,589
No.

1108
01:12:34,622 --> 01:12:37,625
Thank you for reminding me.

1109
01:14:04,946 --> 01:14:07,148
How was Johanna yesterday?

1110
01:14:07,181 --> 01:14:09,951
She stays away now.

1111
01:14:09,984 --> 01:14:12,053
You let me know if that changes.

1112
01:14:15,256 --> 01:14:19,026
Petra, last night, you weren't,
by any chance, in my study?

1113
01:14:20,127 --> 01:14:21,829
-No, Lydia.
-Because you do know

1114
01:14:21,862 --> 01:14:24,098
you're not supposed to be
in there without me.

1115
01:14:24,131 --> 01:14:25,766
I know.

1116
01:14:27,635 --> 01:14:29,603
That's right.

1117
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:04,638
S...

1118
01:15:05,306 --> 01:15:06,741
It's not so simple.

1119
01:15:06,774 --> 01:15:08,242
It's got...
it's got to be messier.

1120
01:15:12,847 --> 01:15:14,115
Okay?

1121
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:25,159
A lot of pressure. Okay?

1122
01:15:28,129 --> 01:15:29,597
Okay?

1123
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:31,165
S-So familiar to everyone here.

1124
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:34,535
It really doesn't help you to
know this piece so well. Okay.

1125
01:15:35,603 --> 01:15:37,571
Same place.

1126
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:07,902
Please.

1127
01:16:07,935 --> 01:16:10,204
Please, please, please.

1128
01:16:10,237 --> 01:16:12,606
You must watch.

1129
01:16:16,844 --> 01:16:18,312
Okay?

1130
01:16:18,345 --> 01:16:19,780
It's got to be like, uh,

1131
01:16:19,814 --> 01:16:23,150
just one person
singing their heart out.

1132
01:16:25,386 --> 01:16:27,922
And...

1133
01:16:33,394 --> 01:16:35,096
Okay.

1134
01:16:43,404 --> 01:16:45,039
Okay.

1135
01:16:47,775 --> 01:16:50,010
Maestro.

1136
01:16:50,044 --> 01:16:50,945
What a surprise.

1137
01:16:50,978 --> 01:16:53,114
-I was just having
a spot of lunch. -Hmm.

1138
01:16:53,147 --> 01:16:54,381
C-Can I offer you anything?

1139
01:16:54,415 --> 01:16:56,117
Uh, no, thank you.

1140
01:16:56,150 --> 01:16:58,919
-Mm, well, some tea, perhaps?
-No, thank you, Sebastian.

1141
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,756
You know, I forget sometimes
just how impressive

1142
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:04,425
your collection is here.

1143
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:06,794
Is that Kalinnikov?

1144
01:17:06,827 --> 01:17:08,262
- Yes.
- Ah.

1145
01:17:08,295 --> 01:17:10,364
Isn't he marvelous?

1146
01:17:10,397 --> 01:17:13,701
He belongs in a museum.

1147
01:17:13,734 --> 01:17:16,070
I rescued him
for a hundred rubles

1148
01:17:16,103 --> 01:17:18,706
-from a Kyiv street fair
back in '90. -Huh.

1149
01:17:18,739 --> 01:17:20,708
Right after the Wall came down.

1150
01:17:20,741 --> 01:17:22,943
That must really
have been something.

1151
01:17:22,977 --> 01:17:26,046
-Oh, incredible to have
lived through it. -Hmm.

1152
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,716
I'd only just arrived here
with Andris,

1153
01:17:28,749 --> 01:17:32,052
and suddenly the impossible
was possible.

1154
01:17:32,086 --> 01:17:33,754
Yeah.

1155
01:17:34,922 --> 01:17:37,391
I'd like to talk about that.

1156
01:17:37,424 --> 01:17:39,293
-The reunification?
-Uh, no, no.

1157
01:17:39,326 --> 01:17:41,395
But please, sit down.

1158
01:17:41,428 --> 01:17:44,765
No, uh, about the possibility

1159
01:17:44,798 --> 01:17:48,302
of you fronting
a subscription orchestra.

1160
01:17:48,335 --> 01:17:49,737
But I already do.

1161
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:52,273
Yes, but not as Kapellmeister.

1162
01:17:53,741 --> 01:17:57,011
If not now,
then when, Sebastian?

1163
01:17:58,312 --> 01:17:59,947
You mean leave Berlin?

1164
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:03,184
Well, rotate somewhere, yes.

1165
01:18:03,217 --> 01:18:05,386
But this is my home.

1166
01:18:05,419 --> 01:18:08,756
Our only home is the podium.

1167
01:18:08,789 --> 01:18:11,192
We all live out of a suitcase.

1168
01:18:11,225 --> 01:18:13,227
You know that as well as anyone.

1169
01:18:19,366 --> 01:18:22,203
Just think about it.

1170
01:18:22,236 --> 01:18:24,772
Take your time. Mm?

1171
01:18:24,805 --> 01:18:27,841
It's not something
we need to decide now.

1172
01:18:30,444 --> 01:18:32,213
It's the girl, isn't it?

1173
01:18:32,246 --> 01:18:33,847
I'm sorry, what girl?

1174
01:18:33,881 --> 01:18:36,283
Y-You're not asking.

1175
01:18:36,317 --> 01:18:38,152
You're telling.

1176
01:18:38,185 --> 01:18:42,856
I knew as soon as she showed up
that my days here were numbered.

1177
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:45,426
Andris told me not to worry,
but...

1178
01:18:45,459 --> 01:18:47,127
... I knew.

1179
01:18:47,161 --> 01:18:50,998
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

1180
01:18:51,031 --> 01:18:52,132
Oh, please.

1181
01:18:52,166 --> 01:18:54,335
Just because
nobody dares breathe it.

1182
01:18:54,368 --> 01:18:56,437
We know the things you do.

1183
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:59,406
The little favors you grant.

1184
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:00,975
I'm...

1185
01:19:01,008 --> 01:19:04,278
I really don't know
what to say, Sebastian.

1186
01:19:04,311 --> 01:19:06,780
I mean, you of all people

1187
01:19:06,814 --> 01:19:08,916
have the temerity
to question my integrity?

1188
01:19:08,949 --> 01:19:10,384
No, no.
I-I'm-I'm sorry, Maestro.

1189
01:19:10,417 --> 01:19:12,119
I don't, I don't know
what I'm saying.

1190
01:19:12,152 --> 01:19:14,888
No, no, no, it's clear you know
exactly what you're saying.

1191
01:19:14,922 --> 01:19:16,991
I mean, if that's how
you really feel about me,

1192
01:19:17,024 --> 01:19:18,892
then wouldn't you say
that staying is

1193
01:19:18,926 --> 01:19:20,127
entirely out of the question?

1194
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,229
No, no, please, Maestro.
Please forgive me.

1195
01:19:22,263 --> 01:19:23,864
For what?

1196
01:19:23,897 --> 01:19:27,167
Your obsequiousness,
your hypocrisy, your misogamy?

1197
01:19:27,201 --> 01:19:30,371
-I'm not a misogynist!
-Misogamy.

1198
01:19:30,404 --> 01:19:32,906
It's a hatred of marriage.

1199
01:19:34,441 --> 01:19:37,344
Andris is still
very much married.

1200
01:19:38,479 --> 01:19:43,417
And you occupy an apartment
on the same floor, don't you?

1201
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:46,987
I just don't like
what he's implying.

1202
01:19:47,888 --> 01:19:51,025
It could lead to more than
Chinese whispers.

1203
01:19:51,058 --> 01:19:52,527
I know.

1204
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,128
We barely survived <i>Der Spiegel</i>

1205
01:19:54,161 --> 01:19:56,363
when you and I
came out together.

1206
01:19:58,032 --> 01:20:02,303
But with Francesca, no one
could point their finger.

1207
01:20:02,336 --> 01:20:04,905
It's not like you two are
in a relationship.

1208
01:20:04,938 --> 01:20:06,407
Yeah, that's true.

1209
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,876
I just...
Turns my stomach to think

1210
01:20:08,909 --> 01:20:11,378
the old robot will be right
about something.

1211
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:17,084
He's probably already run
to Andris.

1212
01:20:17,117 --> 01:20:20,555
Well, is there someone
other than Francesca

1213
01:20:20,588 --> 01:20:22,990
you feel is more qualified?

1214
01:20:25,627 --> 01:20:28,228
There are others
equal to the task.

1215
01:20:31,031 --> 01:20:32,933
Hmm?

1216
01:20:32,966 --> 01:20:35,202
Maybe wait to decide.

1217
01:20:44,378 --> 01:20:46,180
Where are we at with DG?

1218
01:20:46,213 --> 01:20:49,917
-Uh, I spoke to an assistant
in Boyd Muir's office... -Hmm.

1219
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:52,386
... who said they weren't sure
why they decided

1220
01:20:52,419 --> 01:20:56,223
on a digital-only set,
what the criteria were.

1221
01:20:56,256 --> 01:20:58,125
But I do know they just did

1222
01:20:58,158 --> 01:20:59,661
a full-vinyl pressing
for Long Yu.

1223
01:20:59,694 --> 01:21:01,495
Of course they did.

1224
01:21:01,529 --> 01:21:03,897
The Chinese market's incredible.

1225
01:21:03,931 --> 01:21:05,899
All right. Gloves off.

1226
01:21:05,933 --> 01:21:07,368
I'm going straight to Lucian.

1227
01:21:07,401 --> 01:21:08,636
Maybe he needs to be reminded of

1228
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:10,471
his Annenberg
Inclusion Initiative.

1229
01:21:12,172 --> 01:21:13,641
You've got
his contact details, right?

1230
01:21:13,675 --> 01:21:17,010
Mm-hmm.
I'll send it to you right now.

1231
01:21:18,078 --> 01:21:22,149
My machine's misbehaving again.

1232
01:21:22,182 --> 01:21:24,118
I've already spoken to I.T.

1233
01:21:24,151 --> 01:21:26,387
Just here-- let me borrow yours.

1234
01:21:33,494 --> 01:21:35,329
Thank you.

1235
01:21:38,432 --> 01:21:40,234
Where's the matcha?

1236
01:22:24,712 --> 01:22:26,648
Ah, I wasn't sure
where you were.

1237
01:22:26,681 --> 01:22:28,449
Was working out a kink.

1238
01:22:28,482 --> 01:22:31,018
The-the matcha's cold.
I-I'll get another.

1239
01:22:31,051 --> 01:22:32,352
It's all right.
I don't need it.

1240
01:22:32,386 --> 01:22:34,455
Let's just keep working.

1241
01:22:41,729 --> 01:22:44,064
Francesca, you did as I asked

1242
01:22:44,097 --> 01:22:47,602
and deleted any and all
correspondence with Krista,

1243
01:22:47,635 --> 01:22:49,369
correct?

1244
01:22:51,071 --> 01:22:54,141
Um, I'm not sure.

1245
01:22:55,108 --> 01:22:56,678
Uh, I'm-I'm... I'm not sure.

1246
01:22:56,711 --> 01:22:59,146
I-I'll double-check.

1247
01:23:06,153 --> 01:23:09,122
You know,
Sebastian's leaving us,

1248
01:23:09,156 --> 01:23:10,758
and I wondered if you might, uh,

1249
01:23:10,792 --> 01:23:14,995
compile a list
of suitable replacements.

1250
01:23:19,466 --> 01:23:23,003
Uh, of course, feel free
to add your own name.

1251
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,342
Thank you.

1252
01:23:29,544 --> 01:23:33,515
Oh, your-your lunch
with the new cellist.

1253
01:23:33,548 --> 01:23:34,749
Oh.

1254
01:23:34,782 --> 01:23:36,149
Meant to have you
reschedule that

1255
01:23:36,183 --> 01:23:37,785
'til after the orchestra votes.

1256
01:23:37,819 --> 01:23:40,120
I'll text her now.

1257
01:23:41,723 --> 01:23:44,091
No, wait.

1258
01:23:44,124 --> 01:23:46,761
Might as well
see what she's made of.

1259
01:23:55,202 --> 01:23:57,404
This food.

1260
01:23:58,873 --> 01:24:03,176
The cucumber salad's,
uh, very good.

1261
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:05,178
It's kind of the only
real option in this place

1262
01:24:05,212 --> 01:24:06,681
if you're vegetarian.

1263
01:24:06,714 --> 01:24:08,550
Uh, do you eat fish?

1264
01:24:08,583 --> 01:24:10,450
Not really.

1265
01:24:13,186 --> 01:24:16,558
You know, we can go
somewhere else.

1266
01:24:16,591 --> 01:24:18,292
L-Like the Store Kitchen.

1267
01:24:18,325 --> 01:24:21,696
I mean, it's... uh, it's kind
of a silly tradition really

1268
01:24:21,729 --> 01:24:23,765
that new members
are brought here

1269
01:24:23,798 --> 01:24:26,701
to sup with the ghosts
of the past.

1270
01:24:26,734 --> 01:24:29,737
I mean, at some point,
everyone from... from Napoleon

1271
01:24:29,771 --> 01:24:33,775
to Beethoven tucked in for
a meal at one of these tables.

1272
01:24:33,808 --> 01:24:36,243
Yes, and Clara Zetkin.

1273
01:24:36,276 --> 01:24:37,812
I wonder which one.

1274
01:24:37,845 --> 01:24:40,682
Who's that?
It's a, uh, musician?

1275
01:24:40,715 --> 01:24:42,517
No. She helped found

1276
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:45,520
Social Democratic
women's movement in Germany

1277
01:24:45,553 --> 01:24:48,890
and KPD until
Hitler came to power

1278
01:24:48,923 --> 01:24:51,759
and she was exiled
to Soviet Union.

1279
01:24:51,793 --> 01:24:53,360
Clara Zetkin?

1280
01:24:53,393 --> 01:24:54,428
Yes.

1281
01:24:54,461 --> 01:24:57,197
Every March 8th, we place
flowers at her plaque

1282
01:24:57,230 --> 01:24:59,734
in Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

1283
01:24:59,767 --> 01:25:01,301
Her birthday?

1284
01:25:01,335 --> 01:25:03,571
No, International Women's Day.

1285
01:25:06,841 --> 01:25:09,409
Are you ready, Maestro?

1286
01:25:09,443 --> 01:25:13,715
-Yes, uh... -Yes,
first shashlik, then veal.

1287
01:25:14,749 --> 01:25:17,250
-For you?
-Cucumber salad.

1288
01:25:17,284 --> 01:25:18,586
-Thank you.
-Good choice.

1289
01:25:21,789 --> 01:25:23,825
Some more bread?

1290
01:25:23,858 --> 01:25:25,693
Hmm.

1291
01:25:30,898 --> 01:25:32,634
It's good.
Would you like a bite?

1292
01:25:32,667 --> 01:25:34,535
Oh, no.

1293
01:25:34,569 --> 01:25:36,403
No. Thank you.

1294
01:25:37,404 --> 01:25:39,239
Have you lived in Berlin long?

1295
01:25:39,272 --> 01:25:41,174
No, not at all.

1296
01:25:41,208 --> 01:25:42,610
I have friends in Wicker I visit

1297
01:25:42,644 --> 01:25:45,312
-until I know decision
of orchestra. -Hmm.

1298
01:25:46,213 --> 01:25:47,915
Simonov will hold your place?

1299
01:25:47,949 --> 01:25:51,151
Yes, I think so.
He is my uncle.

1300
01:25:52,419 --> 01:25:53,453
Oh.

1301
01:25:53,487 --> 01:25:56,524
But my dream has always been
to play with Berlin.

1302
01:25:56,557 --> 01:25:58,559
Oh, me, too.

1303
01:25:58,593 --> 01:26:00,662
There's nowhere like it.

1304
01:26:04,398 --> 01:26:08,168
I imagine, uh, Rostropovich
is a hero of yours.

1305
01:26:08,970 --> 01:26:11,338
Well, of course, he was great.

1306
01:26:11,371 --> 01:26:13,473
We study him
at Moscow Conservatory,

1307
01:26:13,508 --> 01:26:17,712
but growing up, my favorite
is Jacqueline du Pré.

1308
01:26:17,745 --> 01:26:20,347
She made me want to play cello.

1309
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:21,783
Which record was it?

1310
01:26:21,816 --> 01:26:24,552
Not record. YouTube.

1311
01:26:24,585 --> 01:26:26,453
Elgar Concerto.

1312
01:26:28,255 --> 01:26:29,489
Oh, of course.

1313
01:26:29,524 --> 01:26:32,259
With Barenboim conducting
the London Phil.

1314
01:26:32,292 --> 01:26:34,996
I don't know who was conducting.

1315
01:26:35,029 --> 01:26:37,965
But she did something to me.

1316
01:26:37,999 --> 01:26:39,834
That's when I decide
to learn piece

1317
01:26:39,867 --> 01:26:42,436
and play it
with youth orchestra.

1318
01:26:42,469 --> 01:26:44,539
Quite a challenge.
How old were you?

1319
01:26:44,572 --> 01:26:46,339
Thirteen.

1320
01:26:47,675 --> 01:26:49,309
Wow.

1321
01:26:49,342 --> 01:26:51,278
I'd love to hear it.

1322
01:26:51,311 --> 01:26:54,214
They make video.
I will text to you.

1323
01:30:02,103 --> 01:30:03,905
Beautiful.

1324
01:30:13,681 --> 01:30:16,651
Now, um, just before we break,

1325
01:30:16,684 --> 01:30:18,719
I know many of you are wondering

1326
01:30:18,753 --> 01:30:21,722
what the companion piece
will be.

1327
01:30:21,756 --> 01:30:24,225
And I have been
thinking quite a bit about it

1328
01:30:24,258 --> 01:30:26,193
and was wondering
if we could just take

1329
01:30:26,227 --> 01:30:29,931
an informal poll about
possibly pairing the Five

1330
01:30:29,964 --> 01:30:32,867
with Elgar's Cello Concerto.

1331
01:30:58,859 --> 01:31:03,531
Oh, and, uh, given what
we've all been through,

1332
01:31:03,564 --> 01:31:05,099
what we're still going through,

1333
01:31:05,132 --> 01:31:09,770
and we're finally back
together as a family, I-I...

1334
01:31:10,905 --> 01:31:12,907
... I feel that
maybe the soloist

1335
01:31:12,940 --> 01:31:15,710
should come from
within our own ranks.

1336
01:31:15,743 --> 01:31:17,044
Yeah.

1337
01:31:18,612 --> 01:31:19,947
Good. Okay, good.

1338
01:31:19,981 --> 01:31:22,783
Just... Sorry.
One more question.

1339
01:31:22,817 --> 01:31:25,019
And this really is
just for you, Gosia.

1340
01:31:25,052 --> 01:31:26,721
I mean...

1341
01:31:26,754 --> 01:31:29,523
... as a practical matter,
I mean, this would

1342
01:31:29,557 --> 01:31:31,659
normally fall to you.

1343
01:31:31,692 --> 01:31:34,261
But given how much is gonna be
asked of you with the Mahler,

1344
01:31:34,295 --> 01:31:36,163
I-I wondered if you'd be
at all bothered

1345
01:31:36,197 --> 01:31:38,899
if we were to hold auditions?

1346
01:31:47,742 --> 01:31:51,112
Well, that's a bit unorthodox.

1347
01:31:54,181 --> 01:31:57,251
But, in theory,
I have no objection.

1348
01:31:57,284 --> 01:31:58,819
My only hesitation
will depend on

1349
01:31:58,853 --> 01:32:00,287
when these auditions
might take place.

1350
01:32:00,321 --> 01:32:01,889
I wouldn't want them in any way

1351
01:32:01,922 --> 01:32:03,224
to interfere with
our sectionals.

1352
01:32:03,257 --> 01:32:05,026
No, no, no.
That's a good point.

1353
01:32:05,059 --> 01:32:06,761
I mean, it is gonna
have to be a...

1354
01:32:06,794 --> 01:32:08,195
It's gonna have to be a sprint.

1355
01:32:08,229 --> 01:32:09,930
Um...

1356
01:32:11,298 --> 01:32:13,100
How about Monday?

1357
01:32:17,138 --> 01:32:18,873
All right.

1358
01:32:22,076 --> 01:32:23,344
Okay, good.

1359
01:32:23,377 --> 01:32:26,647
Knut, would you assemble
a quorum for Monday?

1360
01:32:41,362 --> 01:32:43,798
Let me see what she says.

1361
01:32:43,831 --> 01:32:45,766
Okay, I got, I gotta go.

1362
01:32:46,967 --> 01:32:48,803
Britta, hi.

1363
01:32:48,836 --> 01:32:49,804
Lydia.

1364
01:32:49,837 --> 01:32:51,672
-Just caught the end.
-Ah!

1365
01:32:51,705 --> 01:32:53,607
What'd you think? How's it, uh,
how's it sounding?

1366
01:32:53,641 --> 01:32:55,843
Oh, it's fantastic.

1367
01:32:55,876 --> 01:32:58,112
I can't wait
until the live recording.

1368
01:32:58,145 --> 01:32:59,847
Yes, well.

1369
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:02,316
I'll be happy when it's over.

1370
01:33:02,349 --> 01:33:04,118
It's always that way.

1371
01:33:04,151 --> 01:33:07,388
I know you're busy, and I don't
want to add to your load,

1372
01:33:07,421 --> 01:33:09,657
but...

1373
01:33:09,690 --> 01:33:11,826
Andris Davis called.

1374
01:33:11,859 --> 01:33:15,096
Look, he's upset
I'm rotating Sebastian.

1375
01:33:15,129 --> 01:33:16,363
No, no, no, no, no.

1376
01:33:16,397 --> 01:33:17,832
Something else.

1377
01:33:17,865 --> 01:33:19,133
But you will please
let Laura know

1378
01:33:19,166 --> 01:33:20,668
as soon as you have chosen
his replacement

1379
01:33:20,701 --> 01:33:22,002
so she can prepare
a press release.

1380
01:33:22,036 --> 01:33:23,304
Yeah, of course.

1381
01:33:23,337 --> 01:33:25,139
Uh, so what did he want?

1382
01:33:25,172 --> 01:33:27,708
To complain about
the punctuality of a driver

1383
01:33:27,741 --> 01:33:30,644
he seems to believe
the board supplies him with.

1384
01:33:30,678 --> 01:33:32,780
Do you know anything about this?

1385
01:33:32,813 --> 01:33:33,814
Yes.

1386
01:33:33,848 --> 01:33:37,017
No, it's just... it's just
something I pay for.

1387
01:33:37,051 --> 01:33:39,787
Then why does he believe
it's the board?

1388
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:43,090
Because he needs
to believe that.

1389
01:33:43,124 --> 01:33:44,925
H-He needs to b...

1390
01:33:44,959 --> 01:33:47,394
needs to believe he hasn't
been forgotten, Britta.

1391
01:33:47,428 --> 01:33:50,164
Uh, the academy
has von Karajan's name on it,

1392
01:33:50,197 --> 01:33:52,867
and there are love shrines
to Abbado all over this place.

1393
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:57,204
But the name of Davis, it's
essentially nowhere to be seen.

1394
01:33:57,238 --> 01:33:58,906
All right.

1395
01:33:58,939 --> 01:34:02,309
Then perhaps Francesca could
have a word with the driver.

1396
01:34:02,343 --> 01:34:04,745
Of course.

1397
01:34:04,778 --> 01:34:06,747
One other thing.

1398
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:08,415
It's unpleasant.

1399
01:34:08,449 --> 01:34:10,050
Oh, is it?

1400
01:34:10,084 --> 01:34:11,986
Operational shortfall?

1401
01:34:12,019 --> 01:34:14,455
Must I take Mrs. Sewing
out to drinks again?

1402
01:34:14,488 --> 01:34:16,457
No, no, no, nothing to do
with the orchestra.

1403
01:34:16,490 --> 01:34:18,792
Do you remember
an Accordion Academy fellow

1404
01:34:18,826 --> 01:34:21,228
named Krista Taylor?

1405
01:34:24,331 --> 01:34:26,467
Yes. Why?

1406
01:34:26,501 --> 01:34:29,170
Apparently,
she committed suicide.

1407
01:34:29,203 --> 01:34:32,306
Oh, God. Poor thing.

1408
01:34:32,339 --> 01:34:34,308
Her parents mu...

1409
01:34:35,242 --> 01:34:38,012
Wait, sorry,
I'm... I'm confused, Britta.

1410
01:34:38,045 --> 01:34:40,314
Why, why were you put
in the position

1411
01:34:40,347 --> 01:34:41,782
to deliver this terrible news?

1412
01:34:41,815 --> 01:34:43,851
Why didn't Accordion
contact me directly?

1413
01:34:43,884 --> 01:34:45,853
It's delicate, Lydia.

1414
01:34:45,886 --> 01:34:47,321
Mr. Kaplan thought
it might be best

1415
01:34:47,354 --> 01:34:48,856
if you contacted a lawyer

1416
01:34:48,889 --> 01:34:51,325
before speaking with anyone
at Accordion.

1417
01:34:51,358 --> 01:34:54,862
Well, presumably, that anyone
includes Eliot himself.

1418
01:34:56,864 --> 01:35:00,134
I'm, I'm sorry, why-why
would I need to do that?

1419
01:35:00,167 --> 01:35:04,705
Apparently, some accusations
have been made.

1420
01:35:06,173 --> 01:35:08,209
Accusations?
What kind of accusations?

1421
01:35:08,242 --> 01:35:09,910
He didn't say.

1422
01:35:09,944 --> 01:35:12,213
But they were brought
to Accordion's counsel.

1423
01:35:12,246 --> 01:35:15,282
Mr. Kaplan said he's certain
nothing will come of it,

1424
01:35:15,316 --> 01:35:17,985
but one can't be too careful.

1425
01:35:36,403 --> 01:35:39,039
I'm sorry about the hour.
It's Lydia Tár calling.

1426
01:35:39,073 --> 01:35:42,243
I need to speak to Mr. Singer
immediately.

1427
01:35:42,276 --> 01:35:43,777
Yes.

1428
01:35:43,811 --> 01:35:45,779
Yes, it's urgent.

1429
01:36:14,576 --> 01:36:16,810
Tired?

1430
01:36:19,847 --> 01:36:22,249
Sleep's elusive.

1431
01:36:23,150 --> 01:36:25,786
I was the same
before a recording date.

1432
01:36:27,354 --> 01:36:29,156
Lydia...

1433
01:36:29,189 --> 01:36:32,960
are-are you absolutely
certain about Sebastian?

1434
01:36:32,993 --> 01:36:35,329
Mm-hmm.

1435
01:36:35,362 --> 01:36:38,198
Who will you replace him with?

1436
01:36:38,232 --> 01:36:40,434
Possibly Andrew Crust.

1437
01:36:41,335 --> 01:36:44,838
He's been assisting
Otto Tausk at the VSO.

1438
01:36:44,872 --> 01:36:47,241
Not the girl?

1439
01:36:56,083 --> 01:36:58,185
Andris...

1440
01:37:01,355 --> 01:37:04,191
... have you ever had an issue

1441
01:37:04,224 --> 01:37:06,960
with a, a student or colleague,

1442
01:37:06,994 --> 01:37:09,063
where that person may have
misinterpreted your intention?

1443
01:37:09,096 --> 01:37:10,497
Has someone been complaining
about me?

1444
01:37:10,532 --> 01:37:12,567
-No, no, no, of course not.
-Because at this point,

1445
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:14,201
they've missed their chance.

1446
01:37:14,234 --> 01:37:16,370
-I'm out of the game.
-Yes, yes, I know, I know.

1447
01:37:16,403 --> 01:37:17,905
Course you are.

1448
01:37:17,938 --> 01:37:19,641
Thank God I was never pulled
from the podium

1449
01:37:19,674 --> 01:37:21,909
like Jimmy Levine.

1450
01:37:21,942 --> 01:37:25,613
Or-or hunted
like Charles Dutoit.

1451
01:37:25,647 --> 01:37:28,248
I take it you're asking
for a reason.

1452
01:37:28,282 --> 01:37:31,251
Well, there's just been
so much of this sort of thing

1453
01:37:31,285 --> 01:37:32,986
in the news lately.

1454
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:36,290
Well, nowadays, to be accused
is the same as being guilty.

1455
01:37:37,224 --> 01:37:38,926
But I suppose
that was also the case

1456
01:37:38,959 --> 01:37:41,995
all those years ago
with Furtwängler.

1457
01:37:42,029 --> 01:37:45,132
A bit with Karajan, too.

1458
01:37:47,635 --> 01:37:50,371
Who was the better conductor?

1459
01:37:51,238 --> 01:37:53,675
I never played
under Furtwängler.

1460
01:37:53,708 --> 01:37:56,176
Yeah, when I first arrived here,
the older members

1461
01:37:56,210 --> 01:37:59,413
had, uh, hmm, hushed opinions.

1462
01:37:59,446 --> 01:38:02,983
At the same time, they wanted
to leave that era behind.

1463
01:38:03,016 --> 01:38:04,418
What, the war?

1464
01:38:04,451 --> 01:38:05,653
-No, postwar.
-Ah.

1465
01:38:05,687 --> 01:38:08,088
Denazification.

1466
01:38:08,122 --> 01:38:09,657
Someone pointed a finger at you,

1467
01:38:09,691 --> 01:38:11,925
process started all over again.

1468
01:38:11,959 --> 01:38:14,495
Furtwängler never joined
the Party.

1469
01:38:14,529 --> 01:38:15,996
Refused to give the salute

1470
01:38:16,029 --> 01:38:18,132
or to conduct the
"Horst-Wessel-Lied."

1471
01:38:18,165 --> 01:38:21,001
Or to sign his letters,
"Heil, Hitler."

1472
01:38:21,034 --> 01:38:24,037
Even those he wrote to Hitler.

1473
01:38:24,071 --> 01:38:28,576
But he was obliged
to be denazified.

1474
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:31,412
Until then, he was semiretired,

1475
01:38:31,445 --> 01:38:34,081
playing corpses.

1476
01:38:34,716 --> 01:38:37,017
Playing corpses?

1477
01:38:37,050 --> 01:38:40,320
Secretly performing
in a graveyard.

1478
01:38:41,756 --> 01:38:44,158
You're not equating
sexual impropriety

1479
01:38:44,191 --> 01:38:46,427
with being an accused Nazi?

1480
01:38:47,461 --> 01:38:49,163
Either way, you had to be ready.

1481
01:38:49,196 --> 01:38:51,999
For years, I made sure
all the hangers in my closet

1482
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:54,201
were facing the same direction.

1483
01:39:04,646 --> 01:39:07,549
How many are auditioning
on Monday?

1484
01:39:11,753 --> 01:39:13,387
No one.

1485
01:39:14,354 --> 01:39:16,089
No one?

1486
01:39:17,491 --> 01:39:20,060
Maybe Martin.

1487
01:39:20,093 --> 01:39:21,763
He's never gotten along
with Gosia.

1488
01:39:21,796 --> 01:39:24,498
He would love to sit downstage
for once.

1489
01:39:26,233 --> 01:39:28,636
Well...

1490
01:39:28,670 --> 01:39:31,104
he's still gonna
have to audition.

1491
01:39:32,707 --> 01:39:34,709
Of course.

1492
01:39:34,742 --> 01:39:37,110
Have to follow the rules.

1493
01:39:38,780 --> 01:39:41,348
Aren't we being
a bit formal, Francesca?

1494
01:39:41,381 --> 01:39:44,084
From what I understand,
there's only one player, right?

1495
01:39:44,117 --> 01:39:47,054
No, Maestro, there are two.

1496
01:40:49,216 --> 01:40:51,184
Well, it's unanimous.

1497
01:40:51,218 --> 01:40:53,755
- Number two.
- Mm-hmm.

1498
01:40:53,788 --> 01:40:55,289
And we have a problem.

1499
01:40:55,322 --> 01:40:56,691
She's not officially
been invited

1500
01:40:56,724 --> 01:40:59,059
to become a member
of the orchestra.

1501
01:41:00,193 --> 01:41:03,531
Well, she wouldn't need to be
to solo for us.

1502
01:41:03,565 --> 01:41:05,700
I believe the criteria
of the audition

1503
01:41:05,733 --> 01:41:08,335
was all section members?

1504
01:41:08,368 --> 01:41:10,605
- Then her audition
gets thrown out. - No.

1505
01:41:10,638 --> 01:41:13,206
Francesca, please ask Martin
to come back in

1506
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:15,475
so we can give him the news.

1507
01:41:15,510 --> 01:41:17,512
Wait. Gosia, let's talk.

1508
01:41:19,814 --> 01:41:22,449
Shit!

1509
01:41:23,618 --> 01:41:26,186
Yeah!

1510
01:41:27,454 --> 01:41:30,825
I'll confirm solo rehearsal
dates with her.

1511
01:41:30,858 --> 01:41:32,794
Thank you.

1512
01:41:32,827 --> 01:41:35,195
Have a seat.

1513
01:41:39,366 --> 01:41:41,401
I have made a decision

1514
01:41:41,435 --> 01:41:44,271
regarding Sebastian's
replacement.

1515
01:41:45,372 --> 01:41:49,176
And I want you to know
it wasn't an easy one.

1516
01:41:50,444 --> 01:41:54,782
Uh, this position brings with it
enormous responsibility,

1517
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:58,352
- and my personal affection
for you aside... -

1518
01:41:58,385 --> 01:42:03,290
... I will have to go with
someone more, more experienced.

1519
01:43:02,950 --> 01:43:04,952
Oh, leave me alone.

1520
01:43:04,986 --> 01:43:07,487
I don't have your paper.

1521
01:43:08,388 --> 01:43:10,323
I've told you before, I...

1522
01:43:10,357 --> 01:43:12,527
Oh, I'm sorry. Please come in.

1523
01:43:58,539 --> 01:43:59,574
Good. Good.

1524
01:43:59,607 --> 01:44:02,844
I-I think the contrast is,
it's much better now.

1525
01:44:02,877 --> 01:44:04,444
-Don't you think?
-Hmm.

1526
01:44:04,478 --> 01:44:06,346
How do you take your coffee?

1527
01:44:06,379 --> 01:44:08,583
Black. Strong.

1528
01:44:10,084 --> 01:44:12,019
Is all right if I play?

1529
01:44:12,053 --> 01:44:14,655
Hmm? Oh, yes,
of course, of course.

1530
01:45:03,070 --> 01:45:05,706
That's as far as I've gotten.

1531
01:45:05,740 --> 01:45:07,809
But it's good.

1532
01:45:07,842 --> 01:45:10,511
Um, this part here.

1533
01:45:14,115 --> 01:45:16,617
Maybe change A to B-flat?

1534
01:45:20,387 --> 01:45:22,757
That's better.
I like that sound.

1535
01:45:24,457 --> 01:45:26,727
Come on. Take a break.

1536
01:45:26,761 --> 01:45:28,729
Okay.

1537
01:45:41,042 --> 01:45:42,643
<i>Sharon?</i>

1538
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:47,782
Hello.

1539
01:46:03,631 --> 01:46:05,498
Petra.

1540
01:46:31,125 --> 01:46:33,060
What are you doing in here?

1541
01:46:33,094 --> 01:46:36,097
I'm hiding from her.

1542
01:46:36,130 --> 01:46:37,698
Why?

1543
01:46:37,732 --> 01:46:40,835
Because she told me
to put my things in order,

1544
01:46:40,868 --> 01:46:43,738
but they already are.

1545
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:48,709
I can see that.

1546
01:46:49,710 --> 01:46:50,912
Come on.

1547
01:46:50,945 --> 01:46:52,914
They're all waiting for you.

1548
01:46:52,947 --> 01:46:56,217
I'm going to give
everyone a pencil.

1549
01:46:56,250 --> 01:46:57,652
All of them?

1550
01:46:57,685 --> 01:46:59,186
They can't all conduct, honey.

1551
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:02,857
It's not a,
it's not a democracy.

1552
01:48:08,589 --> 01:48:10,124
Okay, uh...

1553
01:48:16,263 --> 01:48:19,033
-Hey, that's good.
-Yeah. Good.

1554
01:48:19,066 --> 01:48:20,234
You happy?

1555
01:48:23,804 --> 01:48:26,741
How long were you acquainted
with Miss Taylor?

1556
01:48:26,774 --> 01:48:30,845
Oh, I'd have to double-check
with my assistant,

1557
01:48:30,878 --> 01:48:33,781
but cumulatively speaking,
I'd say

1558
01:48:33,814 --> 01:48:36,550
-not more than a few months.
-Hmm.

1559
01:48:36,584 --> 01:48:39,053
-Thank you for your time,
Maestro. -Not at all.

1560
01:48:40,187 --> 01:48:42,656
-This recording will exist on
a protected server... -Mm-hmm.

1561
01:48:42,690 --> 01:48:44,892
... under attorney-client
privilege with Mr. Singer.

1562
01:48:44,925 --> 01:48:46,694
-Great.
-He will follow up with you

1563
01:48:46,727 --> 01:48:48,629
to help prepare
for the deposition.

1564
01:48:51,866 --> 01:48:53,768
Deposition?

1565
01:48:53,801 --> 01:48:55,169
Yes.

1566
01:48:55,202 --> 01:48:57,038
I assumed you were aware.

1567
01:48:57,071 --> 01:48:59,173
Mr. Singer's office said
they'd been coordinating

1568
01:48:59,206 --> 01:49:01,208
with your assistant.

1569
01:49:01,242 --> 01:49:03,844
Francesca, you'd better get
your pretty little ass to work

1570
01:49:03,878 --> 01:49:05,579
right now.

1571
01:49:07,048 --> 01:49:09,016
The only communication
we've received from Francesca

1572
01:49:09,050 --> 01:49:11,252
was an email to my assistant
in the middle of the night

1573
01:49:11,285 --> 01:49:12,820
tendering her immediate
resignation,

1574
01:49:12,853 --> 01:49:14,655
stating she would be in contact

1575
01:49:14,688 --> 01:49:17,058
when she had more details
to provide.

1576
01:49:17,091 --> 01:49:18,659
What kind of details?

1577
01:49:18,692 --> 01:49:20,127
A new address, I suppose.

1578
01:49:20,161 --> 01:49:22,630
In the meantime,
we've been trying all morning

1579
01:49:22,663 --> 01:49:24,198
to find someone suitable
to assist you

1580
01:49:24,231 --> 01:49:25,666
on a temporary basis.

1581
01:49:25,699 --> 01:49:27,334
For now, perhaps
your new assistant conductor

1582
01:49:27,368 --> 01:49:29,003
would be the right fit.

1583
01:49:29,036 --> 01:49:31,605
No. No. He's not available
'til after the live Five date.

1584
01:49:31,639 --> 01:49:33,707
Yes, I'm ready. Let's go.

1585
01:49:37,711 --> 01:49:39,613
I know how much
you depended on her.

1586
01:49:39,647 --> 01:49:41,015
Two-faced little bitch.

1587
01:49:41,048 --> 01:49:42,683
Imagine her hurt, Tár.

1588
01:49:42,716 --> 01:49:45,086
-Don't you dare try to
defend her. -God, slow down!

1589
01:49:45,119 --> 01:49:46,821
She'll come galumphing back.

1590
01:49:46,854 --> 01:49:48,823
-I mean, I've got a dumb phone
like every robot. -Tár, s...

1591
01:49:48,856 --> 01:49:50,991
- How hard can it be to text
all day? -

1592
01:49:51,025 --> 01:49:53,627
Slow down!

1593
01:49:53,661 --> 01:49:55,930
Or let me out!

1594
01:50:16,851 --> 01:50:19,019
Francesca!

1595
01:50:52,052 --> 01:50:54,822
Fräulein?

1596
01:51:44,238 --> 01:51:45,507
Come.

1597
01:53:21,869 --> 01:53:23,437
Sorry I'm late again.

1598
01:53:23,470 --> 01:53:25,839
Oh.

1599
01:53:30,344 --> 01:53:33,180
D-Do you live here?

1600
01:53:33,213 --> 01:53:35,449
Not normally, no.

1601
01:53:35,482 --> 01:53:37,051
Uh, make yourself at home.

1602
01:53:37,084 --> 01:53:38,419
I'm just gonna put something on.

1603
01:53:38,452 --> 01:53:40,020
Do you have a towel?

1604
01:53:42,089 --> 01:53:44,391
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1605
01:53:49,496 --> 01:53:52,299
I got caught in the rain.

1606
01:54:03,410 --> 01:54:06,146
There is small concert
with musician friends.

1607
01:54:06,180 --> 01:54:07,448
You should come.

1608
01:54:08,650 --> 01:54:12,219
Thanks, but I-I...
really must get home.

1609
01:54:12,252 --> 01:54:15,356
-You have child, yes?
-Mm-hmm.

1610
01:54:15,389 --> 01:54:17,157
I will not do that.

1611
01:54:19,426 --> 01:54:21,261
Pets are better for some people.

1612
01:54:24,131 --> 01:54:26,967
Oh.

1613
01:54:34,174 --> 01:54:35,342
What... Oh.

1614
01:54:35,376 --> 01:54:36,611
-Sorry.
-Bye.

1615
01:54:36,644 --> 01:54:37,978
Oh, yes. Goodbye. Yes.

1616
01:54:38,011 --> 01:54:39,380
-Goodbye.
-Okay.

1617
01:54:39,413 --> 01:54:41,281
- Oh.
- Okay.

1618
01:54:48,255 --> 01:54:50,124
Oh, Olga!

1619
01:54:50,157 --> 01:54:51,258
Olga!

1620
01:54:59,266 --> 01:55:01,101
Olga?

1621
01:55:07,575 --> 01:55:09,910
Olga?

1622
01:55:38,172 --> 01:55:39,940
Hello?

1623
01:55:51,519 --> 01:55:53,287
Olga?

1624
01:56:11,773 --> 01:56:13,508
Olga?

1625
01:56:22,650 --> 01:56:24,218
Olga?

1626
01:57:11,599 --> 01:57:13,668
Why didn't you go to the police?

1627
01:57:13,701 --> 01:57:16,571
I fought. He ran.
What's to tell?

1628
01:57:20,307 --> 01:57:21,241
Oh, God.

1629
01:57:21,275 --> 01:57:22,644
I'm gonna get you something
for the pain.

1630
01:57:22,677 --> 01:57:23,678
No, I don't need anything.

1631
01:57:23,711 --> 01:57:25,813
No, I'm gonna get you something.

1632
01:57:31,886 --> 01:57:33,588
<i>Ja.</i>

1633
01:57:49,202 --> 01:57:51,606
Lydia!

1634
01:57:54,341 --> 01:57:55,342
Lydia!

1635
01:58:00,915 --> 01:58:03,083
What is it?

1636
01:58:05,152 --> 01:58:07,220
Hold my foot.

1637
01:58:15,495 --> 01:58:16,864
Is that better?

1638
01:58:16,898 --> 01:58:18,566
Yes.

1639
01:58:59,807 --> 01:59:01,643
Okay.

1640
01:59:01,676 --> 01:59:04,411
Let's, uh, shoo the elephant
from the room.

1641
01:59:05,513 --> 01:59:08,315
"What the hell happened
to her face?"

1642
01:59:08,348 --> 01:59:10,652
"Did she, uh, schedule
a nose and eye job

1643
01:59:10,685 --> 01:59:13,487
and bail before the surgeon
finished the other half?"

1644
01:59:18,559 --> 01:59:20,427
No.

1645
01:59:20,460 --> 01:59:21,963
I was, uh, I was attacked.

1646
01:59:21,996 --> 01:59:24,599
Thank you.

1647
01:59:24,632 --> 01:59:26,567
I'm fine. Really.

1648
01:59:26,601 --> 01:59:28,536
Should've seen the other guy.

1649
01:59:28,569 --> 01:59:29,570
All right.

1650
02:00:14,749 --> 02:00:16,450
Don't.

1651
02:00:16,483 --> 02:00:17,985
It burns.

1652
02:00:18,019 --> 02:00:20,320
You must see the doctor.

1653
02:00:20,353 --> 02:00:22,255
He's booked 'til next week.

1654
02:00:22,289 --> 02:00:23,524
I'll call them again

1655
02:00:23,558 --> 02:00:25,258
and tell them how much pain
you're in.

1656
02:00:25,292 --> 02:00:27,662
No, no, let's just,
let's just finish up here.

1657
02:00:27,695 --> 02:00:29,329
Okay?

1658
02:00:29,362 --> 02:00:31,364
Overall, the balance
feels right.

1659
02:00:31,398 --> 02:00:32,667
Other than a quick brushup,

1660
02:00:32,700 --> 02:00:35,302
we should concentrate
on the Elgar.

1661
02:00:35,335 --> 02:00:37,939
You're certain of that?

1662
02:00:37,972 --> 02:00:40,474
I think so. Yes.

1663
02:00:40,508 --> 02:00:42,375
<i>We're absolutely</i>
<i>rock-solid there,</i>

1664
02:00:42,409 --> 02:00:47,048
but I am going to try
to hold them back here.

1665
02:00:47,081 --> 02:00:48,883
Uh, they're just
getting caught up in the power

1666
02:00:48,916 --> 02:00:52,854
of your, uh, glissando
in there, trying to match it.

1667
02:00:52,887 --> 02:00:55,923
Um, probably...

1668
02:00:55,957 --> 02:00:58,626
Where were you attacked,
Maestro?

1669
02:00:58,659 --> 02:01:01,662
Oh, doesn't matter.

1670
02:01:01,696 --> 02:01:03,363
Here.

1671
02:01:03,396 --> 02:01:06,634
Thank you.

1672
02:01:06,667 --> 02:01:08,035
There you are.

1673
02:01:08,936 --> 02:01:11,438
-When did this fall happen?
-Uh, it's all a blur.

1674
02:01:11,471 --> 02:01:14,075
Three, four days ago.

1675
02:01:14,108 --> 02:01:15,710
It's just my shoulder. Yeah.

1676
02:01:15,743 --> 02:01:19,479
It kind of burns,
like I fell asleep by the pool.

1677
02:01:20,581 --> 02:01:23,785
Okay, you can
put your shirt back on.

1678
02:01:23,818 --> 02:01:25,052
You've damaged some nerves.

1679
02:01:25,086 --> 02:01:26,521
The burning sensation
you're feeling

1680
02:01:26,554 --> 02:01:28,055
is called notalgia paresthetica.

1681
02:01:28,089 --> 02:01:29,456
Nostalgia?

1682
02:01:29,489 --> 02:01:31,726
"Notalgia." No "S."

1683
02:01:31,759 --> 02:01:34,361
-Well, how do we treat it?
-You don't.

1684
02:01:34,394 --> 02:01:35,730
Eventually, it goes away.

1685
02:01:35,763 --> 02:01:39,299
An adjustment might help.
You're somewhat crooked.

1686
02:02:27,615 --> 02:02:29,584
Oh, well, then you must be

1687
02:02:29,617 --> 02:02:32,954
a Negro product
exploited by the Jews.

1688
02:02:34,522 --> 02:02:37,457
Now let's turn our gaze back
to the piano bench up there

1689
02:02:37,490 --> 02:02:39,694
to a superhot young woman.

1690
02:02:40,761 --> 02:02:42,864
That's-that's...
th-that was very good.

1691
02:02:42,897 --> 02:02:44,999
Now, you could masturbate,

1692
02:02:45,032 --> 02:02:48,736
but what are you
actually doing to me?

1693
02:02:54,208 --> 02:02:55,776
- Britta.
- Hi, hi.

1694
02:02:55,810 --> 02:02:58,679
-Have you seen it?
-Yes, yes. I've just seen it.

1695
02:02:58,713 --> 02:03:01,749
... gathering this afternoon.

1696
02:03:01,782 --> 02:03:03,784
-This afternoon?
-Is that a problem?

1697
02:03:03,818 --> 02:03:05,987
No, just...
No, it's no problem.

1698
02:03:39,687 --> 02:03:45,192
First of all, that class was
conducted in a tech-free zone.

1699
02:03:45,226 --> 02:03:48,996
And second,
whoever violated that rule

1700
02:03:49,030 --> 02:03:52,499
edited what we've all seen
to create linguistic traps

1701
02:03:52,533 --> 02:03:53,968
to completely redefine my words.

1702
02:03:54,001 --> 02:03:56,203
I mean, look at the
reverse shots on the students.

1703
02:03:56,237 --> 02:03:58,072
There's no way that was done
in real time.

1704
02:03:58,105 --> 02:03:59,640
It's a hatchet job.

1705
02:03:59,674 --> 02:04:01,709
I'm sure that's true, Lydia.

1706
02:04:01,742 --> 02:04:05,546
And were it just this video,
we would not be sitting here.

1707
02:04:05,579 --> 02:04:07,081
Unfortunately,
it's linked to an article in

1708
02:04:07,114 --> 02:04:09,717
the <i>New York Post</i> regarding
Krista Taylor's suicide,

1709
02:04:09,750 --> 02:04:12,653
which alludes to
other Accordion fellows

1710
02:04:12,687 --> 02:04:14,655
they claim to have interviewed.

1711
02:04:14,689 --> 02:04:16,824
Laura, can you tell us
about your conversations?

1712
02:04:16,857 --> 02:04:18,092
We haven't had any.

1713
02:04:18,125 --> 02:04:19,827
Obviously, we gave no response

1714
02:04:19,860 --> 02:04:22,563
-as we first wanted to meet
to discuss strategy. -Mm-hmm.

1715
02:04:22,596 --> 02:04:24,865
-Here's the article.
-Thank you, Laura.

1716
02:04:29,203 --> 02:04:32,673
"Enticed and groomed
multiple young women

1717
02:04:32,707 --> 02:04:35,676
"to engage in sex acts
for professional favors.

1718
02:04:35,710 --> 02:04:38,179
Blocked opportunities
to those who didn't comply."

1719
02:04:38,212 --> 02:04:40,715
This is total fiction.

1720
02:04:40,748 --> 02:04:43,084
And the <i>Post</i> is
a how-de-do scandal rag.

1721
02:04:43,117 --> 02:04:45,886
No serious person reads it.

1722
02:04:48,756 --> 02:04:52,593
And so far as
Krista Taylor goes,

1723
02:04:52,626 --> 02:04:53,995
she was disturbed.

1724
02:04:54,028 --> 02:04:56,097
I mean, she fixated on me.

1725
02:04:56,130 --> 02:04:57,999
In what way?

1726
02:04:58,032 --> 02:04:59,567
She sent me weird gifts.

1727
02:04:59,600 --> 02:05:01,102
She trolled me online.

1728
02:05:01,135 --> 02:05:04,038
-She tried to send me signals.
-Well, what kind of signals?

1729
02:05:04,071 --> 02:05:07,274
She vandalized my Wikipedia
page to say she was my muse.

1730
02:05:07,308 --> 02:05:09,777
I mean,
that's easily checked, right?

1731
02:05:09,810 --> 02:05:13,514
And did you ever report this
or file a complaint?

1732
02:05:14,982 --> 02:05:16,617
No.

1733
02:05:16,650 --> 02:05:19,186
No. And I... Look, I probably,
I probably should have.

1734
02:05:19,220 --> 02:05:21,789
I... I felt sorry for her.

1735
02:05:21,822 --> 02:05:23,591
Is this something
you shared with Sharon?

1736
02:05:23,624 --> 02:05:25,292
No. I didn't want
to burden her with it.

1737
02:05:25,326 --> 02:05:27,294
-Don't you think
you should have? -Yes. Yes.

1738
02:05:27,328 --> 02:05:29,063
Well, what-what do you advise?

1739
02:05:29,096 --> 02:05:31,766
Well, for now, it hasn't gotten
all that much traction.

1740
02:05:31,799 --> 02:05:34,335
None of the trades have linked
to it or called for comment.

1741
02:05:34,368 --> 02:05:36,804
-So I say let's see
what happens. -Mm-hmm.

1742
02:05:38,005 --> 02:05:41,642
We wanted to give you as much
warning as possible, Lydia,

1743
02:05:41,675 --> 02:05:43,711
before this Friday's
donor meeting.

1744
02:05:43,744 --> 02:05:45,646
Well, unfortunately,
I won't be there.

1745
02:05:45,679 --> 02:05:47,915
Well, I very much advise
that you are.

1746
02:05:47,948 --> 02:05:49,784
I have the book launch
in New York

1747
02:05:49,817 --> 02:05:52,586
and apparently a deposition.

1748
02:05:53,788 --> 02:05:56,791
Well, we'll fill you in
upon your return, then.

1749
02:05:59,226 --> 02:06:01,062
Enjoy your weekend.

1750
02:06:03,230 --> 02:06:05,366
Starving.

1751
02:06:05,399 --> 02:06:07,168
Finished my thing today.

1752
02:06:07,201 --> 02:06:10,171
Congratulations.
We should go out and celebrate.

1753
02:06:10,204 --> 02:06:12,139
I can't. I gotta pack.

1754
02:06:12,173 --> 02:06:13,974
- Hi!
- Hi, Lydia.

1755
02:06:19,313 --> 02:06:21,248
Sharon?

1756
02:06:21,282 --> 02:06:23,651
Yeah?

1757
02:06:23,684 --> 02:06:25,352
You seen my performance score?

1758
02:06:25,386 --> 02:06:27,855
No. Why?
Isn't it with the other ones?

1759
02:06:27,888 --> 02:06:29,890
No. No, it's not.

1760
02:06:29,924 --> 02:06:32,693
Are you sure
it's not in my office?

1761
02:06:34,962 --> 02:06:37,765
Yeah, what about
the orchestra library?

1762
02:06:39,266 --> 02:06:41,902
Yeah, can you
check again, please?

1763
02:06:44,705 --> 02:06:47,141
I don't know. Yes, exactly.

1764
02:07:04,158 --> 02:07:06,360
Lydia?

1765
02:07:08,929 --> 02:07:10,331
Yes?

1766
02:07:10,364 --> 02:07:13,234
When will you be back?

1767
02:07:13,267 --> 02:07:15,669
The day after tomorrow.

1768
02:07:15,703 --> 02:07:17,338
Will you promise?

1769
02:07:17,371 --> 02:07:19,874
Yes, I promise.

1770
02:07:30,184 --> 02:07:32,720
-Good night.
-Good night.

1771
02:07:46,834 --> 02:07:49,136
Thanks.
Do you have any bottles?

1772
02:07:49,170 --> 02:07:50,404
Of course.

1773
02:07:51,573 --> 02:07:53,774
Do you need anything else
before I close the cabin door?

1774
02:07:53,807 --> 02:07:56,877
Uh, yes.
Uh, we're waiting on one more.

1775
02:08:03,350 --> 02:08:04,885
<i>To all my questions</i>

1776
02:08:04,919 --> 02:08:06,720
pertaining to
your communications

1777
02:08:06,754 --> 02:08:09,323
with Krista Taylor and others,

1778
02:08:09,356 --> 02:08:11,959
your answers have always been

1779
02:08:11,992 --> 02:08:16,830
"I don't know"
or "I don't remember."

1780
02:08:18,966 --> 02:08:20,467
Is there anything
I could show you

1781
02:08:20,502 --> 02:08:23,470
that might help refresh
your recollection?

1782
02:08:23,505 --> 02:08:26,173
Any documents,
such as emails from you

1783
02:08:26,207 --> 02:08:28,842
or your personal assistant,
Miss Lentini,

1784
02:08:28,876 --> 02:08:32,880
that might help you recall
what you did and didn't say?

1785
02:08:40,921 --> 02:08:42,790
I guess you heard by now.

1786
02:08:42,823 --> 02:08:45,759
Bryant Park bumped you
to 53rd Street.

1787
02:08:48,862 --> 02:08:51,899
This is the Kaplan Fund's
prepared statement.

1788
02:08:53,934 --> 02:08:55,436
I'm sorry to say this is likely

1789
02:08:55,469 --> 02:08:57,037
the last time
we'll see each other.

1790
02:08:57,071 --> 02:08:59,373
Well, now I can buy
my own plane tickets.

1791
02:08:59,406 --> 02:09:00,975
And you can bother someone else

1792
02:09:01,008 --> 02:09:04,445
to try and teach you
to crawl to the podium.

1793
02:09:21,962 --> 02:09:24,331
Is there a back entrance?

1794
02:09:24,365 --> 02:09:28,802
"Indeed, the common metaphors
used to explain music

1795
02:09:28,836 --> 02:09:30,971
"are based on
the idea that music

1796
02:09:31,005 --> 02:09:35,543
"is a language,
albeit a secret one.

1797
02:09:35,577 --> 02:09:40,848
"And in this way,
holy and unknowable.

1798
02:09:42,349 --> 02:09:46,086
"These joyful noises we make
being the closest thing

1799
02:09:46,120 --> 02:09:50,090
"any of us might ever
experience to the divine...

1800
02:09:51,325 --> 02:09:56,330
"... yet something born by
the mere act of moving air.

1801
02:09:58,465 --> 02:10:01,168
No different than birdsong."

1802
02:10:09,977 --> 02:10:12,313
So, meet downstairs
in half an hour for dinner?

1803
02:10:12,346 --> 02:10:15,182
Thank you, but I am jet-lagged.
I go to sleep now.

1804
02:10:15,215 --> 02:10:19,286
Yeah, me, too.
I'll... probably do the same.

1805
02:11:18,045 --> 02:11:19,614
Yes, hello.

1806
02:11:19,647 --> 02:11:22,517
Yes, there's no water
in my room.

1807
02:11:22,550 --> 02:11:24,652
Yes, I've checked the minibar.

1808
02:11:24,686 --> 02:11:27,221
How long would it take
to get a bottle of water?

1809
02:11:27,254 --> 02:11:30,057
Uh, don't worry.
I'll just come down.

1810
02:11:32,993 --> 02:11:34,461
Lobby, please.

1811
02:12:01,355 --> 02:12:04,291
Oh, Jesus.

1812
02:12:16,470 --> 02:12:19,072
It was Britta.

1813
02:12:19,741 --> 02:12:21,643
Right?

1814
02:12:21,676 --> 02:12:23,611
I mean, that is
how you heard about

1815
02:12:23,645 --> 02:12:26,346
these millennial robots
trading in lies.

1816
02:12:26,380 --> 02:12:29,183
I couldn't care less about
the Juilliard thing.

1817
02:12:29,216 --> 02:12:31,318
Too much time on her hands.

1818
02:12:31,351 --> 02:12:32,620
She's fringe.

1819
02:12:32,654 --> 02:12:35,088
The worst kind.

1820
02:12:35,122 --> 02:12:37,257
Every time
I walk out of this house,

1821
02:12:37,291 --> 02:12:41,061
she's in your ear with intrigue
or she's asking me about

1822
02:12:41,094 --> 02:12:44,298
some other piece of fringe,
like Samantha Hankey.

1823
02:12:44,331 --> 02:12:47,367
God, a nobody
who has nothing better to do

1824
02:12:47,401 --> 02:12:51,739
than drop my name at lunch
and imply things.

1825
02:12:51,773 --> 02:12:53,541
I feel sorry for you.

1826
02:12:53,575 --> 02:12:55,577
Save it.

1827
02:12:56,578 --> 02:12:59,079
I tried calling you last night.

1828
02:13:00,815 --> 02:13:03,618
Did you have fun with her?

1829
02:13:03,651 --> 02:13:06,588
My back is killing me.

1830
02:13:06,621 --> 02:13:08,088
Francesca left,

1831
02:13:08,121 --> 02:13:10,558
and I simply needed someone
to carry my bags.

1832
02:13:10,592 --> 02:13:12,594
I mean, who was I
supposed to ask?

1833
02:13:12,627 --> 02:13:15,630
To go with me? Hmm? Knut?

1834
02:13:15,663 --> 02:13:17,297
Jesus fucking...

1835
02:13:17,331 --> 02:13:19,567
There are many things
I accept about you.

1836
02:13:19,601 --> 02:13:21,168
And in the end,

1837
02:13:21,201 --> 02:13:25,105
I'm sure I could get over
something like this.

1838
02:13:25,138 --> 02:13:28,041
But that's not what
we're talking about, is it?

1839
02:13:30,410 --> 02:13:31,746
These accusations

1840
02:13:31,779 --> 02:13:35,082
from the parents of the girl
who suicided?

1841
02:13:40,120 --> 02:13:42,590
You honestly believe
what they're saying?

1842
02:13:46,728 --> 02:13:48,462
They're lies.

1843
02:13:50,264 --> 02:13:52,099
Do you understand
what it was like

1844
02:13:52,132 --> 02:13:54,201
to walk into
my sectional yesterday

1845
02:13:54,234 --> 02:13:57,204
and to see everybody
whispering about me?

1846
02:13:57,237 --> 02:14:01,743
It's got nothing to do with
what they're accusing you of.

1847
02:14:01,776 --> 02:14:03,811
It's a simple matter

1848
02:14:03,845 --> 02:14:07,347
of not warning me
that our family is in danger.

1849
02:14:08,215 --> 02:14:10,417
And what good
would that have done?

1850
02:14:10,450 --> 02:14:13,487
I mean, what could you possibly
do to make things better?

1851
02:14:15,790 --> 02:14:18,225
Because I deserve that.

1852
02:14:18,258 --> 02:14:20,360
Those are the rules.

1853
02:14:21,328 --> 02:14:23,765
You are to ask
for my fucking counsel,

1854
02:14:23,798 --> 02:14:25,833
the way you always have.

1855
02:14:25,867 --> 02:14:27,702
The way you did
when you first arrived here

1856
02:14:27,735 --> 02:14:30,705
as a guest conductor looking
for a permanent position.

1857
02:14:30,738 --> 02:14:33,240
You asked me
what were the politics,

1858
02:14:33,273 --> 02:14:36,310
what were the moves,
how could we swing it.

1859
02:14:38,780 --> 02:14:40,582
Of course...

1860
02:14:40,615 --> 02:14:44,217
these conversations
took place in another bed.

1861
02:14:44,251 --> 02:14:46,888
Or rather, the couch

1862
02:14:46,921 --> 02:14:49,456
of that horrible place
you still can't let go of.

1863
02:14:49,489 --> 02:14:52,225
Old sorrow blows in.

1864
02:14:53,661 --> 02:14:58,231
How cruel of you to define our
relationship as transactional.

1865
02:15:01,368 --> 02:15:05,472
There's only one relationship
you've ever had that wasn't.

1866
02:15:05,506 --> 02:15:08,543
And she is sleeping
in the room next door.

1867
02:15:08,576 --> 02:15:11,646
Apparently, this hasn't even
crossed your mind.

1868
02:17:24,344 --> 02:17:26,413
Petra!

1869
02:17:28,883 --> 02:17:30,618
Come here, darling.

1870
02:17:32,920 --> 02:17:34,354
-It was good.
-Was it?

1871
02:17:34,387 --> 02:17:36,657
-Yeah.
-You want to go to the park?

1872
02:17:37,558 --> 02:17:39,727
Don't do this.
Please don't do this.

1873
02:17:39,761 --> 02:17:41,428
Please don't.

1874
02:18:07,454 --> 02:18:09,924
Hello. I am Anna Franzen.

1875
02:18:09,957 --> 02:18:12,827
This is
my late mother's apartment.

1876
02:18:14,394 --> 02:18:17,765
Oh, yeah, I'm so sorry
about your mother.

1877
02:18:17,799 --> 02:18:19,934
Thank you.

1878
02:18:19,967 --> 02:18:22,069
How's your sister doing?

1879
02:18:22,103 --> 02:18:25,438
Eleanor lives now
in a facility in Neukölln.

1880
02:18:25,472 --> 02:18:27,108
I'm sorry to trouble you,

1881
02:18:27,141 --> 02:18:30,545
but my husband and I
are selling the place

1882
02:18:30,578 --> 02:18:34,749
and couldn't help
hearing the music.

1883
02:18:34,782 --> 02:18:35,950
Oh.

1884
02:18:35,983 --> 02:18:37,552
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

1885
02:18:37,585 --> 02:18:39,120
We were wondering if there are

1886
02:18:39,153 --> 02:18:41,088
specific hours you rehearse,

1887
02:18:41,122 --> 02:18:43,891
so we can schedule showings
around them.

1888
02:18:44,892 --> 02:18:47,829
We don't want to scare
potential buyers off

1889
02:18:47,862 --> 02:18:50,430
with all the noise.

1890
02:18:50,463 --> 02:18:52,934
Oh, no.

1891
02:18:52,967 --> 02:18:54,035
No.

1892
02:18:56,137 --> 02:18:58,139
No, we wouldn't want that.

Come on, give me some eyes!

1905
02:21:46,874 --> 02:21:48,642
Lydia.

1906
02:21:49,310 --> 02:21:52,179
This is my score.

1907
02:21:52,213 --> 02:21:54,648
Lydia, you're confused.

1908
02:21:54,682 --> 02:21:56,617
It's my score!

1909
02:21:56,650 --> 02:21:59,987
You fucking little nothing!

1910
02:22:08,195 --> 02:22:09,296
I'm fine.

1911
02:22:38,959 --> 02:22:41,729
You sign CAMI voucher.

1912
02:23:03,651 --> 02:23:06,087
Good afternoon. CAMI.

1913
02:23:06,120 --> 02:23:07,788
Hold on.

1914
02:23:08,722 --> 02:23:10,224
Normally, I'd think Lisa Rich

1915
02:23:10,257 --> 02:23:12,927
in our booking department
would be a great fit for you,

1916
02:23:12,960 --> 02:23:15,262
but she's just got
too much on her plate.

1917
02:23:15,296 --> 02:23:18,833
So, I'd like to team you
with Jake here.

1918
02:23:18,866 --> 02:23:21,268
Jake, you want to,
you want to show Lydia

1919
02:23:21,302 --> 02:23:22,970
what you've prepared for her?

1920
02:23:23,003 --> 02:23:25,239
Well...

1921
02:23:25,272 --> 02:23:27,808
right now it's a reset.

1922
02:23:27,842 --> 02:23:29,410
What we're after is less,
not more.

1923
02:23:29,443 --> 02:23:30,811
We want to be selective

1924
02:23:30,845 --> 02:23:32,847
and rebuild this
from the ground up.

1925
02:23:32,880 --> 02:23:34,882
That means we need a new story.

1926
02:23:39,286 --> 02:23:41,122
Just here.

1927
02:23:41,155 --> 02:23:42,923
Here. Thank you.

1928
02:23:42,957 --> 02:23:44,992
Make it 40.

1929
02:23:45,025 --> 02:23:46,694
Thank you.

1930
02:25:20,087 --> 02:25:22,089
Didn't you feel triumphant?

1931
02:25:25,426 --> 02:25:29,230
Now we can really understand
what the meaning of music is.

1932
02:25:29,263 --> 02:25:33,467
It's the way it makes you feel
when you hear it.

1933
02:25:33,501 --> 02:25:36,538
Finally, we've taken
that last giant step.

1934
02:25:36,571 --> 02:25:39,139
And we're there.
We know what music means now.

1935
02:25:39,173 --> 02:25:42,009
And we don't have to know
a lot of stuff about sharps

1936
02:25:42,042 --> 02:25:44,378
and flats and chords
and all that business

1937
02:25:44,411 --> 02:25:49,350
in order to understand music
if it tells us something.

1938
02:25:49,383 --> 02:25:52,987
And the most wonderful thing of
all is that there's no limit to

1939
02:25:53,020 --> 02:25:57,191
the different kinds of feelings
music can make you have.

1940
02:25:57,224 --> 02:26:01,128
And some of those feelings
are so special and so deep

1941
02:26:01,161 --> 02:26:03,531
that they can't even be
described in words.

1942
02:26:03,565 --> 02:26:04,999
You see, we can't always name

1943
02:26:05,032 --> 02:26:06,333
the things we feel.

1944
02:26:06,367 --> 02:26:07,401
Sometimes we can.

1945
02:26:07,434 --> 02:26:09,003
We can say we feel joy,

1946
02:26:09,036 --> 02:26:12,873
pleasure, peacefulness,
whatever, love, hate.

1947
02:26:12,906 --> 02:26:15,075
But every once in a while,

1948
02:26:15,109 --> 02:26:17,945
we have feelings that are
so deep and so special

1949
02:26:17,978 --> 02:26:19,547
that we have no words for them.

1950
02:26:19,581 --> 02:26:22,550
And that's where music
is so marvelous,

1951
02:26:22,584 --> 02:26:24,985
because music names them for us,

1952
02:26:25,019 --> 02:26:27,921
only in notes
instead of in words.

1953
02:26:27,955 --> 02:26:29,356
It's all in the way music moves.

1954
02:26:29,390 --> 02:26:32,159
You must never forget
that music is movement,

1955
02:26:32,192 --> 02:26:35,029
always going somewhere,
shifting and changing

1956
02:26:35,062 --> 02:26:38,899
and flowing
from one note to another.

1957
02:26:38,932 --> 02:26:40,301
And that movement can tell us

1958
02:26:40,334 --> 02:26:43,538
more about the way we feel
than a million words can.

1959
02:26:43,571 --> 02:26:45,306
And here we're going
to play you a...

1960
02:26:59,621 --> 02:27:01,388
Tony.

1961
02:27:02,624 --> 02:27:04,325
Oh.

1962
02:27:04,358 --> 02:27:05,560
Hi, Linda.

1963
02:27:05,593 --> 02:27:07,094
Sorry.

1964
02:27:07,127 --> 02:27:09,263
Lydia.

1965
02:27:09,296 --> 02:27:11,566
Ma said you'd be over.

1966
02:27:11,599 --> 02:27:14,068
You must be hiding out.

1967
02:27:14,669 --> 02:27:17,371
Why would I be hiding out?

1968
02:27:17,404 --> 02:27:19,541
Beats the hell out of me.

1969
02:27:19,574 --> 02:27:21,975
None of my business anyhow.

1970
02:27:23,043 --> 02:27:25,446
Lot of loose ends,
you got to admit.

1971
02:27:27,247 --> 02:27:28,616
What do you mean?

1972
02:27:28,650 --> 02:27:31,018
Well, like I said,
it ain't my business.

1973
02:27:32,152 --> 02:27:34,355
But you don't seem to know
where the hell you came from

1974
02:27:34,388 --> 02:27:36,123
or where you're going.

1975
02:28:28,409 --> 02:28:30,177
May I come inside?

1976
02:28:31,412 --> 02:28:33,113
Thank you.

1977
02:28:45,058 --> 02:28:46,561
Um, I'm so sorry.

1978
02:28:46,594 --> 02:28:49,296
Uh, we just wanted to confirm
that the composer was in fact

1979
02:28:49,329 --> 02:28:51,365
not flying in from Osaka
to attend the concert.

1980
02:28:51,398 --> 02:28:53,033
Oh.

1981
02:28:53,066 --> 02:28:56,170
I-I must tell you that I-I
looked in the music libraries,

1982
02:28:56,203 --> 02:28:59,973
uh, for her score,
but I-I couldn't find anything.

1983
02:29:00,007 --> 02:29:02,176
-This just arrived.
-Ah.

1984
02:29:02,209 --> 02:29:04,378
That's great. Thank you.

1985
02:29:05,547 --> 02:29:08,182
Shirley and Cirio will be
most happy to show you

1986
02:29:08,215 --> 02:29:10,417
-the sights of our beautiful
country. -Oh. Thank you.

1987
02:29:10,451 --> 02:29:12,252
Thank you so much.

1988
02:29:12,286 --> 02:29:14,354
Oh, goodness.

1989
02:29:14,388 --> 02:29:16,156
Thank-thank you.

1990
02:29:47,254 --> 02:29:51,425
Maybe we could stop somewhere
and take a swim.

1991
02:29:51,458 --> 02:29:53,093
Yeah, at the waterfall.

1992
02:29:53,126 --> 02:29:55,195
But, mm, not in the river.

1993
02:29:55,229 --> 02:29:57,632
Why? Is there something wrong
with the water?

1994
02:29:57,665 --> 02:30:00,434
N-No. There are crocodiles.

1995
02:30:00,467 --> 02:30:02,402
Oh.

1996
02:30:02,436 --> 02:30:05,105
I didn't think
they'd be this far inland.

1997
02:30:05,138 --> 02:30:08,175
They escaped from
Marlon Brando movie.

1998
02:30:08,208 --> 02:30:09,644
Wow.

1999
02:30:09,677 --> 02:30:12,580
That was a long time ago.

2000
02:30:12,614 --> 02:30:14,448
They survive.

2001
02:30:48,650 --> 02:30:51,218
Lady. Lady.--

2002
02:30:53,220 --> 02:30:54,622
Here is prescription.

2003
02:30:54,656 --> 02:30:56,423
-Ten dollars.
-Oh. Thank you.

2004
02:30:57,491 --> 02:31:01,829
Uh, is there somewhere
around here-- thank you--

2005
02:31:01,863 --> 02:31:04,097
where I could get a massage?

2006
02:31:04,131 --> 02:31:06,568
Was hoping it might help me
with this jet lag.

2007
02:31:08,603 --> 02:31:10,572
Hmm.

2008
02:31:10,605 --> 02:31:11,806
Yes.

2009
02:31:11,839 --> 02:31:14,642
There is
the very nice place I know.

2010
02:31:14,676 --> 02:31:16,443
Thank you.

2011
02:31:29,524 --> 02:31:30,758
Thank you.

2012
02:31:30,792 --> 02:31:32,694
Please step over
to the fishbowl.

2013
02:31:32,727 --> 02:31:34,596
The... the fishbowl?

2014
02:31:34,629 --> 02:31:36,363
Yes, over there.

2015
02:31:41,769 --> 02:31:43,236
Um, I'm sorry, I'm confused.

2016
02:31:43,270 --> 02:31:45,439
H-How does this...
how does it work?

2017
02:31:46,273 --> 02:31:48,475
You just pick a number here.

2018
02:31:49,777 --> 02:31:51,813
I pick a number?

2019
02:31:51,846 --> 02:31:53,581
Yes.

2020
02:32:04,458 --> 02:32:06,661
Number five?

2021
02:32:49,971 --> 02:32:51,806
Good morning.

2022
02:32:51,839 --> 02:32:53,407
Good morning.

2023
02:32:53,440 --> 02:32:55,943
Now, before we begin,
let's-let's talk a bit about

2024
02:32:55,977 --> 02:32:59,580
the composer's intent
with this piece.

2025
02:33:00,848 --> 02:33:02,850
And what she might be after.

2026
02:33:21,869 --> 02:33:23,738
Five minutes.

2027
02:33:55,368 --> 02:33:57,370
Thank you.

2028
02:34:21,028 --> 02:34:25,298
Sisters and brothers
of the Fifth Fleet, it's time.

2029
02:34:25,332 --> 02:34:27,769
I'll keep my farewell brief.

2030
02:34:27,802 --> 02:34:30,470
Never was much with words.

2031
02:34:30,505 --> 02:34:34,575
Once you board this ship,
there's no turning back.

2032
02:34:34,609 --> 02:34:38,780
The next ground your feet touch
will be that of the New World.

2033
02:34:41,414 --> 02:34:43,383
If any of you
have lost your nerve,

2034
02:34:43,416 --> 02:34:47,688
then step away now
and let no one judge you.
