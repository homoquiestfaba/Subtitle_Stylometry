[Background talk]
[music]

2
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,760
A California man is getting ready
to launch himself into the air

3
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,400
in a home-made rocket to
prove that the Earth is flat.

4
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,200
Look, any idiot can sit in their bedroom
uploading conspiracy theories to YouTube,

5
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,480
but it takes a special idiot to launch
himself into space for the cause.

6
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,340
Shasta, Haley, Curtis.

7
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:53,120
He's done it before. He shot himself
like 160 miles into space, not really.

8
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,700
No he did. I think he did shoot
himself 1.6 miles into the air.

9
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,980
It might be something he said,
he might just be crazy.

10
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,540
- I wonder how this ends for this guy?
- Probably, you know how it ends?

11
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,500
- "Fuck. It's round."
- That's how this story ends.

12
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,000
Smart enough to build a missile from
scratch, yet stupid enough to climb inside,

13
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,220
- my kind of crazy.
- You may not learn whether the earth is round,

14
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,680
but I have a feeling you're about
to learn a lot about gravity.

15
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,880
[laughs]

16
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,369
I am Michael Hughes,
better known as Mad

17
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:41,504
Mike Hughes for some
unknown reason, I guess.

18
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,520
I live in Apple Valley, California,
which is in Southern California.

19
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,060
It's a place called The High Desert.

20
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,580
I live with my four cats,

21
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,489
and live a pretty quiet
existence considering

22
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:55,660
what I do, which is build rockets.

23
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,520
I'm a limousine driver,
and have been for about 21 years,

24
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,127
and a former NASCAR crew chief, I'm a

25
00:03:02,327 --> 00:03:05,384
daredevil, and self-taught
rocket scientist.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,100
Me saying I'm a self-taught
rocket scientist is a misnomer

27
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:15,080
because I really don't believe in
science. I believe in formulas, some math.

28
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,420
Not these things where the whole
chalk board's full of some formula

29
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,840
that no one knows, except three people.
I just want the raw truth.

30
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,280
And I believe in the Flat Earth model.

31
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,451
I'm not going to take
anyone else's word for it,

32
00:03:30,651 --> 00:03:33,080
or NASA, or especially
Elon Musk with SpaceX.

33
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,240
I'm going to build my
own rocket right here

34
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,940
and I'm going to see it with my own
eyes what shape this world we live on.

35
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,720
And that's Mad Mike is in a nutshell.

36
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,840
I got started at 6:30 this morning. This
is the first time I've sat down all day.

37
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:55,740
My back is done. My right shoulder
and both my knees are hurting.

38
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,080
I've got other interests,
other than this rocket, believe me.

39
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,420
There are other things
I want to be doing,

40
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,320
but to do something like this,
it takes everything

41
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,980
and it will take everything from you. This
is what a lot of people don't understand.

42
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,600
This is why a lot of guys get divorced
and it will tear a family up.

43
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,040
It will bankrupt you,
or do all that kind of nasty stuff.

44
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,400
We just ran across this. Some
guy did an artist's rendering of me.

45
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,520
My hair might look like
that first thing in the morning,

46
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,060
but after it's blow-dried, I think
it looks a little nicer than that.

47
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,382
My tongue's not that long,
where I'd be in porn,

48
00:04:36,582 --> 00:04:38,420
but he did a real good
job with the rocket.

49
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,020
But he's got my four cats right here.

50
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,440
This guy says I'm a plant to make Flat
Earthers look stupid. Is that what it is?

51
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,340
This is endless. You can spend one whole
day going through the internet

52
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:58,620
with people making drawings of me
with rockets stuck up my ass and now,

53
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,260
we've got cats in my video.
It's unbelievable,

54
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,710
but he did a good job
with the rocket, though.

55
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,060
Let's see what Haley thinks about it. Hey,
Haley, someone just sent a picture of you.

56
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,680
Which one is you? See?
It looks like shit, doesn't it?

57
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,200
See that really pisses me off.
You make fun of me and my hair,

58
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,623
I don't give a shit, but
don't make fun of my

59
00:05:18,823 --> 00:05:21,064
cats, ok? I draw the
line right there. Ok?

60
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,620
Most of the stuff I buy is remnants, or
scrap, or whatever from these metal places.

61
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,640
It's very rare I buy something new.

62
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,240
I'll have them cut this down

63
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,640
where I can even haul it
back to the rocket ranch.

64
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,980
Oh hey, Candice. This is part
of the platform for the rocket

65
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,900
because now it's on
its wing standing straight up.

66
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,660
Instead of being on the ground,
it's going to be on this.

67
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,260
And we already got the frame made.
Is this thing really on backwards?

68
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,260
You got it on backwards,
we were telling you that.

69
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,820
[laughs]

70
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,180
- I don't like to wear hard hats.
- I don't think it's good for my hair.

71
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,960
That's the big thing in my
life is my cats and my hair.

72
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,960
Mike is a good indicator
of never giving up.

73
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,200
Regardless of how hard
it is, he keeps going.

74
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,320
It's like this little pelican that has the
frog, and the frog is choking the pelican.

75
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,340
The picture says, 'Never give up',

76
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,640
that's what he reminds me of. He's the
little frog inside the pelican's mouth.

77
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,640
[laughs]

78
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,680
- I brought my own tape today.
- It'll be $42.44.

79
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:32,380
Being forced to be thrifty and frugal is
everything on this project, everything.

80
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,280
Basically, this is the perfect example

81
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,880
of how some of the parts have
transformed into my rocket.

82
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,880
This is some kind of an air filter.
No one really knows what it's off from.

83
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,660
There's numbers on it
and all kinds of crazy stuff.

84
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,742
I said, "Man, that's a
great shape for a rocket

85
00:07:49,942 --> 00:07:51,560
nozzle." I bought one
and brought it home.

86
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,680
It's on this stand, so I don't use
the stand, of course. It's useless,

87
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,140
but it's kinda cool to keep.
So here is the filter part.

88
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:04,000
No one knows what it filters, ok? But
now, luckily, when I took this apart,

89
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,820
there is nothing welded inside.
You can see the

90
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,300
shape is perfect for a
bell rocket nozzle.

91
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,160
That's the rocket nozzle
on the rocket right now, $50.

92
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,500
It may be around since
the 1950s, who knows?

93
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,391
Is this something that
NASA would use or SpaceX?

94
00:08:19,591 --> 00:08:21,940
I don't know, but for
my use, it's perfect.

95
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,920
This is one of the many examples of how

96
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,540
something that was scrap and used for
something else wound up on my rocket.

97
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,300
This is kind of funny.
I just noticed this, 'Gravity'.

98
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,340
It's on the sticker,
I don't believe in gravity. There it is.

99
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,875
I was never tempted to
get in the motorcycle

100
00:08:47,075 --> 00:08:48,680
stunt business because
I knew people in it,

101
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,680
only three or four guys
were making money.

102
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,140
I mean there was guys going
and jumping for $200, $300, or $500.

103
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,604
And you can get killed.
But, I thought, you know

104
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,820
I want to do something
crazy, and I thought,

105
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,520
"What can I do?" I sit
down, I watch TV. I

106
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,420
just turn the TV on and
the Teletubbies is on.

107
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,740
Remember that crazy show?
I fell asleep watching the Teletubbies.

108
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,180
I dreamed about jumping a limo

109
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,300
in the stomach of one of the Teletubbies.
When I woke up, I'm thinking,

110
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,100
"Wow! That's a hell of an idea.
Jump a limo, no one has done that."

111
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:25,720
[crowd cheering]

112
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,460
Let me out. Let me out.

113
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,260
- Can you raise your hand?
- Come on. Are you all right?

114
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:48,140
- There he is. Mad Mike Hughes!
- [crowd cheering]

115
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,780
I guess it was worth it. It didn't
put any money in my bank account,

116
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,040
I don't think,
but very few things ever has anyway.

117
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,420
The flat earth thing, this time,
has to go up and down

118
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,900
because the rocket is standing up now.

119
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,117
You're doing a vertical
large this time?

120
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:18,660
Yes, that's the only
way I can do it there.

121
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,760
From the highway, it's a quarter mile
from the road and all this area's flat.

122
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,440
Good deal. I tell some
of the media people this

123
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,200
launch is going to get more viewers
around the world than the Superbowl

124
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,860
is going to get and some of the guys go,

125
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,540
"Yeah, right." Some guys
go, "Wait a second.

126
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,740
No one in Finland
cares about the Superbowl."

127
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,240
This is what's wrong with the world
today, no one knows what's real.

128
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,520
I don't know. I just researched and I

129
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,320
try to research the research
and that's what I always do.

130
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,920
Well, I know I like climbing trees but

131
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,540
if I came from a monkey then
why the hell are monkeys still here?

132
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,200
You know what I mean?

133
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,820
- I think that [mumbles].
- It's okay right here?

134
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,260
- Yes.
- Okay. Cool.

135
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:24,280
Okay, so we'll watch another video
of some uninformed idiot

136
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,120
that's made one who's got
to much time on their hands,

137
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,500
who doesn't know me.
If they'd walked inside my living room,

138
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,899
they would shut them up
real quickly knowing,

139
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:34,940
seeing just half of my accomplishments.

140
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,420
Go get a life, okay? How
am I bothering you?

141
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,820
Because I may believe in
something you don't believe in?

142
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,940
It's just nutty that people actually
do this. Don't mess with me!

143
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,490
Go mess with someone else. Dude,
you don't know my background. Okay?

144
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,500
Have I beat up people? Yes. Have I pushed
people through plate glass windows? Yes.

145
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,400
Have I rammed people's-their head
into the quarter panel of the suburban

146
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,860
and then kick their ribs in? Yes.
And heard their ribs snap, yes. Okay?

147
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,920
But I'm a nice guy.

148
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:15,100
There is not an employee of NASA,
of Virgin Galactic,

149
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,620
of Blue Horizon,

150
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,080
that's ever designed, built,
and launched himself in a rocket.

151
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,200
So, there you go.

152
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,180
They started all this
space crap in the late '40s

153
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,740
and all the way through
the 50s. They're priming people, okay?

154
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:33,600
They will do a fake
attack through holographic images

155
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,262
in the sky, which they
can do, and they'll

156
00:12:36,462 --> 00:12:39,060
simulate attack from
UFOs to unite the world,

157
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,720
to fight these beings from another
planet or another solar system

158
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,040
so we need the one world government,
the one world religion,

159
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,785
and one world everything
and currency. That's

160
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:50,480
how they want to bring
some of that stuff in,

161
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,460
in my opinion.

162
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,140
I haven't had a steady girlfriend
in about, what? 11 years,

163
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,360
which is my choice also.
Do I want to live in Apple Valley?

164
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,580
Uh... no. It's not exactly
the Mecca of entertainment

165
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,280
but it's inexpensive to live
here and I've got a shop.

166
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,900
To have this down the hill where you're
close to everybody and everything else.

167
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,300
That is $1,500, $2,000, $2,200 a month.

168
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,180
There's some months,
I don't make that much money,

169
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,540
so now how do you eat?

170
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,200
And even worse, you can't buy cat food.

171
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:37,020
That's Jojo. That's my first cat.
Had her for 11 and a half years.

172
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:41,400
I grieved about this cat more
than the death of both my parents.

173
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,307
This is something I can't read.
It's about cats.

174
00:13:46,507 --> 00:13:49,404
It's about animals and
where they wind up.

175
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,180
They cross the rainbow bridge.

176
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,680
This was her leash.

177
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,960
She was an old soul.
People loved this cat.

178
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,620
In fact, some people loved
this cat more than their own cats.

179
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,880
That happened several times.
She was just a wonderful thing.

180
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,620
One of the few things in
my life I've ever loved.

181
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,300
This is her paw print.
This is a part of her fur.

182
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,980
My goal when I go to space,
is I'm going to take this with me.

183
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,600
Okay. Let's see here.

184
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,720
Here we go. There's one of them.

185
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,760
What's up, Waldo?

186
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,200
I think I want to do a round table
at 9:00 in the morning. Can you do that?

187
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,480
- Tomorrow?
- For the space thing?

188
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,540
- Yeah we can do that.
- What do you think about the colors?

189
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,020
I'll take a look at it as
soon as I fix this wire.

190
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:00,500
You've done a lot of work since I've
been gone. You've been a busy boy.

191
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,700
My name is Waldo Stakes.

192
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,200
I've been building flight rockets
since I was 10 years old.

193
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,540
I got interested in rocket-powered
vehicles when I was about 19, 20.

194
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,460
I'm a self-taught rocketeer, everything
I learned, I learned from books

195
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,640
and from experimentation pretty much.

196
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,620
I'm currently retired and so
I have more time for this kind of stuff.

197
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,720
If you come to my house,
you'll see rocket engines everywhere.

198
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,920
I've been collecting them for 40 years.
All kinds of rockets

199
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,400
from maybe 1,000 pounds
of thrust to 60,000 pounds of thrust.

200
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,860
I help people because I like to see
people succeed and most of them

201
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,740
have this dream and
nobody helps them out.

202
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,880
This guy, this Mike here,
I don't consider him a friend.

203
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:47,320
He's like a bad little brother,
that's what he's like, but we get along.

204
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,900
We work together.
We help each other out.

205
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,900
I read about him, something
or other, and I figured

206
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,420
it might be a way to make a few bucks. He
was going to build a rocket, steam rocket,

207
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,504
jump over the Snake River Canyon.
So I called him

208
00:16:00,704 --> 00:16:02,580
up, he's like, "Ya, ya. I'm
building this rocket."

209
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,880
And blah, blah, blah, and then he goes,
"I heard of you." And stuff like that.

210
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,080
I said, "How's the rocket coming along?"
I expected him to say,

211
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,860
"I'm going to get going
on it as soon as I get funded."

212
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,580
Which means, you'll never see
that rocket, but he didn't say that.

213
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:21,040
He goes, "Yes. It's coming along really
good. "He goes, "Do you want to see it?"

214
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,560
I said, "Ya, I want to see
it." I took a look at it

215
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,200
and he said, "What are you thinking?" I
said, "It sucks. It's going to kill you."

216
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,900
I said, "The balance is off.

217
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,600
The structure's okay but in my opinion,
if you're asking me,

218
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,600
it's going to kill you."

219
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,320
He goes, "Would you show me
how to have it not kill me?"

220
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,380
I said, "Ya, I will. I will."

221
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,560
- Hey, Waldo.
- Anytime, babe. Give me a countdown.

222
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:56,080
- Three, two, one.
- No. Got to go farther.

223
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,360
A rocket at 400 degrees
will become superheated water.

224
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,840
When it reaches the atmosphere,

225
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,380
when the plug is pulled and the water goes
shooting out the bottom, it becomes steam

226
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,377
and the steam expands 400
times its size and it gives

227
00:17:18,577 --> 00:17:20,940
thrust to the rocket and
pushes the rocket up.

228
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,940
That's how it works.

229
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:28,060
I keep this with me all the time.
This is ideas and concepts.

230
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,260
Let me see if I can find Mad Mike here.

231
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,140
Wait, I think it's here. It's right here.
See it started with napkin drawings.

232
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,980
This is the first rocket. I said,
"You're going to be tucked down inside.

233
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,820
You need to be tucked down so you can
make the fins anything you want,

234
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,680
shaped any way you want. You can shape
it like a penis. You can paint it tan."

235
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,420
I said, "You could go to Viagra,
or Cialis or one of these companies,

236
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,220
Pfizer, and have it
sponsored from them."

237
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,420
Did he tell you the story of the
launch that he actually did?

238
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,140
Mike goes, "I want to make
sure I beat Evil Knievel's record."

239
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,680
So what he did is when he put the
ramp on that shipping container,

240
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,520
he took a section out of it
and made the ramp 52 degrees.

241
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,220
Now when you're 45 to 50 degrees or so,
you're just in a ballistic arc.

242
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,394
You're at the same
velocity when you reached

243
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,280
here that you're hitting the ground at.

244
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,560
That's basic physics. I said "You
can't have that." But he didn't care.

245
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,440
Daredevils have a different mindset.
And I can't explain it to you.

246
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,755
I can just tell you I've
met dozens of them.

247
00:18:26,955 --> 00:18:28,920
All these guys they got the...
this is it:

248
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,280
If you can give them 50/50 that they've
got a chance of surviving, if they go,

249
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,363
"What do you think my chances are?
Are they 50/50?"

250
00:18:36,563 --> 00:18:38,500
"Yes, you've got 50."
"Okay, let's do it."

251
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,740
Where a normal person would go, "That's
crazy. I want 70/30. I want 90/10.

252
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,050
I actually want 100%."
See, once you get to 100%,

253
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,220
it's not a daredevil stunt
but in their hearts,

254
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,195
they have a different way
of looking at stuff,

255
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,080
see? So here's what
happened with the rocket.

256
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,980
Ok, we had rockets on both of
those chutes, to pull the chutes out.

257
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,860
He goes, 'I don't trust
them damn things."

258
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,740
What ended up happening was he
disconnected the rocket from one of them.

259
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,260
Just before he's ready to get
into the thing, he hears a noise,

260
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,610
and they're looking around
and the rocket has sprung a pin leak.

261
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,720
The pin leak means that's going to crack
the weld and it's going to go BOOM.

262
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,474
It's going to blow up and kill you.
You know

263
00:19:12,674 --> 00:19:14,140
what Mike does? "Everybody
out of the pit!"

264
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,520
He puts his helmet on,
he climbs up the thing, he gets in there

265
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,900
and he wants to beat the explosion.
This is true!

266
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,640
See a 5-point harness, it takes
10 minutes to put a guy into it."

267
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,040
You got to put him in there, keep
scooting him back. There's a pattern.

268
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,920
He goes click, "Get away! Get away!"

269
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,820
Everybody gets out of there, right?
Boom. He hits it.

270
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,910
Here's what happened with the rocket.
When the rocket come off the ramp,

271
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,267
it didn't have enough velocity
to rocket off the ramp.

272
00:19:46,467 --> 00:19:48,400
Instead, it hooked up off
the ramp and it did this.

273
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,900
Then it went into horizontal flight.
When it went into horizontal flight,

274
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,440
it wasn't fighting its weight in the climb
so it picks up another G of acceleration.

275
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,720
So now, he's doing 350,
370, 400 miles an hour,

276
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,860
and then he comes to. He said he
wasn't out, but he was fucking out.

277
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:08,060
Just so happens that when he came to,
he reached for it on the right

278
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,260
and pulled the one that had the rocket,
the chute went, BOOM!

279
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,635
When it comes out like
this and you're doing 400

280
00:20:17,835 --> 00:20:19,360
miles an hour and it's
designed for 100 or less,

281
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,780
it just starts shredding it. So
that's why the chute looked like shit.

282
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,100
It was a perfect chute. I packed it and
it was perfect. It was riddled with holes

283
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,698
but there was just enough there.
It slowed him

284
00:20:27,898 --> 00:20:29,180
down enough and we figured
he hit the ground

285
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,420
at 60 miles an hour.

286
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:46,640
When he hit the ground, I never looked, but
he said his balls were black for a month.

287
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,660
I had to get him a walker.
He could not walk.

288
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,891
He doesn't tell you all
that because he doesn't

289
00:20:54,091 --> 00:20:55,660
want to tell you the bad side of that.

290
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,360
Essentially, he was in a
walker for two months.

291
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,160
- Back up!
- Mike's dad neglected him.

292
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:07,300
He never got any attention as a kid.
He's been driving the limousine so long,

293
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,680
he wants to be in the back.

294
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,180
That gate's such a hassle.

295
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,500
I was tired of it five years ago.

296
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,999
I'd rather have an
eight-foot fence all way

297
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:33,599
around this place, you
couldn't even see through.

298
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,080
I'm going to go check my mail.

299
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,160
Fuck, it's like a maximum security.

300
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,580
They call my mailbox
'the rock' around here.

301
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,860
Alcatraz hasn't got
nothing on my mailbox.

302
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,919
No mail today.

303
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,700
If I still had my limo today, that's
what I'd be driving it right now.

304
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:05,580
I loved the car. It's just different,
people look at it. It's a fun car.

305
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:10,100
It looks like a cross between
a Batmobile and a gangster car.

306
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,620
And I miss it, I think about it every day.
I started making my own license plates,

307
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,000
which is nothing new.
A lot of people have done it.

308
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,080
The California highway patrolman walks
up, "What's with that license plate?"

309
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,820
"It's my license plate."
"Where's the real one?"

310
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,895
"It is a real one. I made it.
It's my private

311
00:22:24,095 --> 00:22:25,700
property. I don't
have to register it."

312
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,146
They called up the towing
company and that's

313
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:30,520
how I got two cars down in impoundment.

314
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,100
I'm just wanting to check on the
status of my '89 Lincoln

315
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,006
town car limousine that
was taken from me by

316
00:22:37,206 --> 00:22:39,720
force. Is it still
there on the property?

317
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,920
- Just one moment, okay?
- Okay.

318
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,660
- Hi, can I help you?
- Hey, how are you? It's Michael Hughes.

319
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,507
Just checking on the
status of my '89 Lincoln

320
00:22:50,707 --> 00:22:52,860
limousine to see if it's still there.

321
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,160
Your Lincoln limousine was taken to
a junkyard and destroyed over a year ago

322
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,280
when it became our legal property.

323
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,560
Okay - It hasn't been here
in a very, very long time.

324
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,080
You are aware that I am the equity
owner of that and you actually-

325
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,160
- No, you're not. No, you're not. We liened
the vehicle, it became our legal property

326
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,800
and we disposed of it legally.

327
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,685
What we're going to do we're going to

328
00:23:14,885 --> 00:23:16,660
citizen's arrest within
the next two weeks.

329
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,680
Good luck with that. Go fuck yourself.

330
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,861
We're going to ask for
the fucking death penalty.

331
00:23:47,061 --> 00:23:48,860
We're going to go for the
fucking death penalty.

332
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,440
I want people to fucking,

333
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
just lose their life over this.

334
00:23:56,165 --> 00:23:57,745
I wish I could have more animals.

335
00:23:57,945 --> 00:23:59,700
I've had two rabbits since I lived here,

336
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,800
they both passed away. Hoppy and Jazzy,
they're both buried on the property.

337
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,420
The thing with animals,
there's no ulterior motives with them.

338
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,380
They only ask for a very
few things and that's it.

339
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:18,440
Where a person or another
man or a woman or a girlfriend,

340
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,660
it's a lot more complicated.
A lot more complicated.

341
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,060
I wish my parents would have live
longer. I wish my dad could've seen this,

342
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,300
what I've done, what I've accomplished.

343
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,540
He'd probably be very proud.
I would like to think he would be.

344
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,340
He'd probably be very surprised.

345
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,880
I wish I could have stayed
closer with my sons.

346
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:47,020
Maybe this is the best time of my life,
this year, right now.

347
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,080
Maybe I'm living the
best time of my life.

348
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,130
A lot of the times we live the best
time of our lives, we don't know it.

349
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,920
And for most people, that
time's in high school.

350
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,580
Have the most fun, the most friends

351
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,040
and you don't realize it.

352
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:09,340
Within a few years, you're in some kind of
corporate job or some kind of profession,

353
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:13,960
I guess, seeking that security,
wanting the house,

354
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,780
and it's all downhill from then

355
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,520
because then your dreams
are sucked out of you.

356
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,740
[music]

357
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,560
- Hey, man. How have you been?
- Boy, busy as ever.

358
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,140
You've built these rockets, you've talked
to the media, people have called you insane

359
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,700
and crazy or a fraud
and that it'll never happen.

360
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,300
I was never trying to prove
the flat E arth with this rocket.

361
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,763
This is just a publicity
stunt to get publicity

362
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,920
to raise some money
to get me into space.

363
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,680
We have a valid plan
to get me 62 miles up,

364
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,735
but you would see that
Felix Baumgartner went

365
00:25:55,935 --> 00:25:57,880
up 130,000 feet, that is
not the edge of space.

366
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,500
They said it was, it's not even close.
It's another 40 miles away.

367
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,500
I'm planning on going up there.
We built a model of the rocket

368
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,400
and there's a valid, four-page
plan that explains this.

369
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,240
Guys, there's something
wrong with this model.

370
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,500
- What's wrong with it?
- It's round. It should be flat.

371
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,980
That's because we have
a different opinion on that.

372
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,860
The plan to get me up
to the space 62 miles up is,

373
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,020
of course, Waldo's plan because
that's above my pay scale,

374
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,000
but I guess I'm the
guy who is going to ride that thing up.

375
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,780
I'm looking forward to it. I wish
we could do it in the next 30 days,

376
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:36,000
but I think we're probably at least
10 to 12 months away from doing it.

377
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,944
The people we've got here
today is some people

378
00:26:38,144 --> 00:26:39,600
that will be part of the space launch,

379
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,240
I guess is what we're going to call it.

380
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,360
My buddy, Pat's here from
Carson City who worked incredibly

381
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,720
without pay at the launch site
in Amboy for at least four days.

382
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,160
And I'll never forget it.
I will never forget it, Pat, okay?

383
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,440
So he's with me from now on.
Of course, Danny, I met through Waldo

384
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,960
at the museum in Boron and he's
been nothing but a gentleman to me.

385
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,940
And I met this other gentleman
this morning, and Steve.

386
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,960
Who knows what this
world is shaped like,

387
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,340
but I think the only way to do it is one
man go up with a camera or several cameras

388
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:18,160
that you can talk to all the way up
and see what's up there.

389
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,120
These are oxygen bottles,
breathing bottles

390
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,575
because he's going to be
up there two to five hours

391
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:26,220
depending on the weather for
him to climb the altitude.

392
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:29,880
Two to five hours,
he's going to go up to 24, 26 miles.

393
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,073
Then, when the balloon
starts moving sideways,

394
00:27:33,273 --> 00:27:34,960
it can't lift him any higher anymore,

395
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,680
this essentially will trigger and
release him. The rocket will fire.

396
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,720
As you can see here, and I'll use
my hands here, the thrust lines

397
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,292
will pull this straight up.
He'll probably be doing,

398
00:27:46,492 --> 00:27:48,720
I don't know, maybe 18,
20 miles an hour a second

399
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,420
and he'll burn out somewhere
around 1,800 miles an hour.

400
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,959
So he goes from 24 miles to
62 miles, but just before

401
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,300
he gets there, there's a
sensor in this thing.

402
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,280
Just when it's just about out of fuel,
it disconnects Mike, boom.

403
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,340
Disconnects Mike like this.
It boogies away from him.

404
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:06,180
It'll reenter the atmosphere
automatically and have its own parachute.

405
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,820
It'll lower itself to the ground.
That's gone. This is helium.

406
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,660
This is a cylinder of helium. The idea
is he'll be flying upwards like Superman,

407
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,900
without a spacecraft.
He'll be doing the speed of a Blackbird,

408
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,460
but he won't know it because there's no air
there to ruffle his clothes or anything.

409
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,687
All he knows is he's just climbing up.
He'll hit apogee.

410
00:28:22,887 --> 00:28:24,960
This is where this
thing really comes in.

411
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,820
Then he'll start to fall.

412
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,900
As he falls, the air will
rocket around his suit

413
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:34,100
and go into this cone inside and
outside and it'll act like a parachute.

414
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,986
He will basically come
all the way down to

415
00:28:36,186 --> 00:28:37,960
10,000 feet where he'll
deploy his parachute

416
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,760
and he should just be able to stand
up and go, "Ta-da." That's the plan.

417
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,320
It's as simple as I can
think about it and make it happen now.

418
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,820
Will this get him to space?
Absolutely, this will work.

419
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,960
What do you think? You've seen all
this stuff. What do you think?

420
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,920
It's not pure O2 so there's no chance
of any fire or any issue like that,

421
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,640
which you have with pure O2 and
actually Buna o-rings in it too

422
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,420
- but with Viton and everything.
- So you're saying

423
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,720
what the O-rings are made of
can contaminate the oxygen supply?

424
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,700
- No. They can start a fire.
- If you had the pure O2, yes,

425
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:13,240
just a Buna o-ring can ignite and burn.

426
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,080
- Your face could start a fire.
- Yes.

427
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,980
- That's the truth.
- Oil on your body.

428
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:23,540
- Holy moly.
- Fellows, before we can start this project

429
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,660
and get it going, we'll have
to finish that one outside.

430
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,660
- All right. Beautiful.
- Let's go do it.

431
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,661
- Yes, let's do it.
- Thank you.

432
00:29:28,861 --> 00:29:30,400
Thanks, everyone. I appreciate it.

433
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,248
I wanted more water
because altitude is your

434
00:29:33,448 --> 00:29:36,340
friend. It gives you another
couple of seconds.

435
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,120
- [phone rings]
- Hello, it's Michael.

436
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,740
- Hello this is Nationwide Financing.
- Oh! Nationwide Financing!

437
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,660
Okay, great. I'm really
looking for some funding,

438
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,917
but what I'm looking for
is about $2 million to

439
00:29:47,117 --> 00:29:49,080
put me into space to
prove the earth is flat.

440
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,520
Can you help me with that?

441
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,060
No, sir. Actually,
I'm not offering any funding today.

442
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,897
Are you at the time making
any daily or weekly

443
00:29:56,097 --> 00:29:58,047
payments for the merchant cash advance?

444
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:02,460
I'm not a merchant because
that's an admiralty term. No,

445
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,620
I don't have any kind of
credit cards or anything like that.

446
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,880
I'm looking for $2 million if you'd
help, or maybe a rich girlfriend.

447
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,080
[laughs].

448
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,140
It's Monday before the proposed
and planned launch date.

449
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,980
We're just loading things up. The rocket
is already loaded on a flatbed trailer,

450
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,547
which is about two or
three blocks from here

451
00:30:24,747 --> 00:30:27,000
and he'll show up about
9:30 this morning.

452
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,800
I just wish we were
already there set up.

453
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,180
That'd be nice and just
do media stuff all week.

454
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,380
It's great. It's getting ready to happen

455
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,201
but you know I just know how much

456
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:40,400
work's got to happen in the
next four or five days.

457
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:45,880
It's nice to be rested up before you do
all this stuff instead of already worn out.

458
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,200
I don't know what that is.

459
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,024
I just wish all the stuff
was together. Hope

460
00:30:55,224 --> 00:30:57,840
we don't run into any kind of problems.

461
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,300
I'm hoping the motorhome's fine.
The rocket launcher,

462
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,800
hopefully, no one's broke into it stolen
stuff. I don't even know that yet.

463
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
See?

464
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,900
Boy that's a lot to
tie down, man. A lot.

465
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,960
When I started out to do this,
I just did it cause I wanted to do it.

466
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,840
That's a lot of things happen.
You just want to do it

467
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,940
and then pretty soon you get so much time
and money invested into something, you go,

468
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,560
"Wait a second man, I need to
recover something on the this."

469
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,740
Then, you start trying to monetize it
and that gets evil in itself.

470
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,090
You think, "How can I make money off this?"
When initially you just wanted to do it.

471
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:41,200
I blame myself a little bit
on that. Or maybe a lot.

472
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,040
Okay.

473
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,660
- Hello?
- Hey, how are you?

474
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,660
- How are you guys?
- Fine. We're ready to get on the road.

475
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,896
It is this weekend, isn't
it, the big weekend?

476
00:32:13,096 --> 00:32:14,540
Yes, that's the plan of Saturday.

477
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,680
We've asked people not to come
there but it hasn't done any good.

478
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,000
- Well, it's big news.
- They want to witness it.

479
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:27,120
We have some questions
if you're up for it.

480
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,360
All right, so tell us about what
you're doing. Why are you doing this?

481
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,159
You know the main reason
to do this is to inspire

482
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:35,520
people to do great
things for their lives,

483
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,220
that you can actually do something
with your bare hands in your garage

484
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:46,000
and with your own mind and affect
people's lives across the world.

485
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,500
I don't want to say around the
globe because I'm a Flat Earther.

486
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,440
[laughs]

487
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,680
I don't know if it is or not,
just I cannot dismiss it.

488
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,040
So, what is the most compelling
piece of evidence that

489
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,320
proves the Flat Earth theory to you?
What was the thing that was like, okay,

490
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,360
now I think something's up?

491
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,838
So, we gotta think about
this, if you're going around

492
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:09,980
the globe, the plane's got
to dip every 5 minutes.

493
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:13,014
They're telling you that it's following
the atmosphere, it's following the

494
00:33:13,214 --> 00:33:16,200
globe and this and that so
it keeps it the same height.

495
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:21,180
I don't buy it. Think about this,
if there's a big vacuum in space,

496
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,820
it should have sucked the
atmosphere off this planet anyway.

497
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:29,340
- There is a lot of things.
- Why should the general public trust you

498
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:34,720
- if they can't trust NASA or the government?
- NASA receives over $50 million a day.

499
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,220
Now, who's going to turn
that water faucet off?

500
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:43,000
People are born to really ridicule
anybody that thinks outside the box.

501
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,875
How high will you be going?

502
00:33:45,075 --> 00:33:47,580
We're thinking this should
reach three-eighths of a mile.

503
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,499
You are going to be
doing a launch that will

504
00:33:49,699 --> 00:33:51,460
send you higher up into space.
Is that correct?

505
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,620
We're just raising publicity, raising
awareness because to get me into space,

506
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,440
the edge of space, which is 62.8 miles,
it's called the Kármán line,

507
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,480
it would take about
$2 million to do this.

508
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,320
What if you get there
and you see the curvature of the earth?

509
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,680
It's round. Why would I lie?

510
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,500
- I have no agenda.
- Okay.

511
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:17,000
- Have no agenda? All right.
- I just want to know the raw truth

512
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,760
- about everything.
- Back to your plans for the weekend,

513
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,620
- Are you nervous or are you calm?
- I'm tired already.

514
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,696
I just wish I had the
energy I had 30 years

515
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:27,820
ago. That's what I wish.
I miss being young.

516
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,780
I miss being young because
I was unstoppable 30 years ago.

517
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,100
You're unstoppable now
by the sounds of it, Mike.

518
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,080
Maybe.

519
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,100
- Good luck with everything.
- Thank you so much.

520
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,780
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

521
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,540
Okay.

522
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,500
My name is Patrick Marquese,
CEO of Markzware software.

523
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:56,580
I came across Mike back in November
during his first rocket launch attempt

524
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:01,400
and it didn't work out so well. He needed
some help and I decided to come out

525
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,040
here and help him during this attempt.

526
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,640
- What about the taillights?
- Well, that's why I asked yesterday.

527
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,640
- I got them. I got it.
- What do I do plug that in there?

528
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,920
Yes. Oh, I've still got

529
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,424
to ground that. God damn.

530
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,773
- The jack stand pinched it.
- Did you get hurt?

531
00:35:24,973 --> 00:35:28,024
Yes, the jack stand
pinched my fucking hand.

532
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,660
- Fuck. I'll get a better one.
- That's okay.

533
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,760
That isn't the best one in the world

534
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,280
- Here's your...
- It's doing the same thing.

535
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,180
I don't even understand that.

536
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:04,860
[music]

537
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,400
This is the road, the back way to
Amboy from my home in Apple Valley.

538
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:21,860
There's less traffic and the
speed limit is not as fast so

539
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,340
that's the way to go.

540
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,560
Instead of getting on
I-40 and going through

541
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,564
Barstow and all that kind of stuff.

542
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,900
- These people behind those are going to hate us.
- That's okay, they can hate us.

543
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,780
We're going to get there safely.

544
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,956
You guys don't break
lights either cause I didn't

545
00:36:49,156 --> 00:36:51,456
have time to look up the
ground to the trailer.

546
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,220
I've never ever been involved
in something like this before ever.

547
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:02,460
- This is this a complete adventure.
- This is unchartered territory, right?

548
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:08,540
Anybody can go to a bar
or a restaurant at any time

549
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:12,140
but doing this? Gee whiz.

550
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:18,100
It's been three months ago now since
we made this journey with the rocket.

551
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,900
The first time we were trying to jump
right around Thanksgiving or whatever,

552
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,700
but it just didn't work out it.

553
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,180
You know, these things
are not easy to do.

554
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:41,500
Just trying to get it turned here guys.

555
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,940
Wait a second.

556
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,780
For me, it's about the man
versus machine thing.

557
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,180
That's what it is. It's
not about flat Earth.

558
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:03,860
If when they got up there into space
and it was flat would they tell us?

559
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:08,120
- I'm thinking no, they wouldn't.
- I guess understanding that the Earth is flat

560
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,600
gets people to know or realize
that there's a creator.

561
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,300
- Yes.
- Like a god, or in my case, God.

562
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,160
That brought me back to believing
in a creator because I was an atheist.

563
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,740
I just figured out everything was a lie.
Everything was a lie.

564
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:29,360
Bible, God, this. The only thing that got
me even believing in the Bible initially

565
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,570
was the mark of the beast.

566
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,240
That's the only thing that
grabbed my attention.

567
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,280
All these parables and
stories, I'm going, "I don't know."

568
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,860
That mark of the beast
thing that made sense

569
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,220
to me because once you
see these scanners

570
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,600
at the stores and whatever...

571
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,340
Maybe we all have the mark of the beast
already with a social security number.

572
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,240
- Who the hell knows?
- Well, the thing about the social security number

573
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,960
is that it's three sets of three.

574
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,640
- That's it? No.
- Yes.

575
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,694
One, two, three, one, three, it's four.

576
00:39:00,894 --> 00:39:02,640
It's nine digits

577
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:07,960
- Is it?
- Yes. It's nine digits and it's just a...

578
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,120
One, t-

579
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,780
So three, three, three.
If you have three, three, three.

580
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:16,980
- Well, mine is for 446...
- Well, no, no, don't say it.

581
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,780
But no, it's nine digits.

582
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,500
Several places in the Bible
talks about the Earth is flat.

583
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:34,120
Does not move and everything revolves
around it. It's the center of the universe.

584
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,160
Now there's a place where I guess
Lucifer had taken Jesus up to what the,

585
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,840
where did He take him?
Had the tallest mountain on the planet

586
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,720
and he saw all four corners,
which is impossible on a globe.

587
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,560
- There's a lot of places.
- Now do I think

588
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,480
at one time that it was possible that
big bang thing could have happened?

589
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,147
And then all these magnetic particles

590
00:39:56,347 --> 00:39:57,255
stuck together and

591
00:39:57,455 --> 00:39:59,080
formed these different
planets and whatever.

592
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,800
I thought, well fuck,
that could have happened, you know?

593
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,180
But then again, you're thinking
that everything started from nothing.

594
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:12,600
Everything was just a black hole. Nothing
existed all sudden this explosion.

595
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:18,580
And that was my hole in that thing all
along. What caused the explosion?

596
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:23,300
But really, you look at that sun right now
man, does that look 93 million miles away?

597
00:40:25,024 --> 00:40:27,024
Doesn't to me.

598
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,720
Now you've got to make
a wide sweeping turn here man.

599
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,100
- Still a little bumpy.
- Yes.

600
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,480
- I think I'm coming up on it.
- That's it. Is that right?

601
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,340
- Think it's what it is?
- Yes, that's it yes.

602
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,120
Yep, it looks like they did
some work right here.

603
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,340
- Right here.
- Holy shit, guys.

604
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,040
- That was something, wasn't it?
- I mean, seriously.

605
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,600
Okay let's start
disconnecting this thing.

606
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,940
Did we bring the jack stand
or did I leave it there for Waldo?

607
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,500
We want to put the rocket I guess
just right here where it's flat

608
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,880
and unload all that
stuff right here on this side.

609
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:48,680
Okay, let's go back down
to Amboy get the RV.

610
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,009
On launch day there will probably be a
bunch of people around here.

611
00:41:54,209 --> 00:41:56,300
I just don't want anybody
down by the launch site.

612
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,160
It's too distracting. Then you get
people doing things nefariously.

613
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,720
- So how's Manny doing?
- He lost his mom.

614
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,580
Oh, shit.

615
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:11,260
I know someone else who lost their
mom this last week who does my eyebrows.

616
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,285
Well, in the 1950s
only about 1 out of 10

617
00:42:14,485 --> 00:42:16,060
people died from it,
now it's 1 out of 3.

618
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,610
- So you go figure.
- Yes, well there's so many different types now.

619
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:24,040
Yes, do you think it's chemical
related or vaccine related?

620
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,860
Hey we're here.

621
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:33,500
Everything's still here man even bottled
water was still left there so that's good.

622
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:37,860
I think that my hammer at your house.

623
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,903
We want to remove this
part that's hanging

624
00:42:43,103 --> 00:42:44,500
down because we aren't going to use it,

625
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,800
it's gonna go to the scrap yard.
Just need a small uh,

626
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,040
small little something to beat with.

627
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,540
Beat with? Well, alright,
beat it with this.

628
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,564
- Okay, that'll work.
- If we start pushing

629
00:42:54,764 --> 00:42:56,300
it down we need to
have someone kind of,

630
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,860
I don't want to smash out the
windshield, you know what I mean?

631
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,600
- What are we doing now?
- We're going to remove this thing.

632
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,700
Is that what we're doing?

633
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,580
Fuck yeah, we're going to
leave it right here.

634
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:08,080
- Okay.
- Yes. Let's see if we can manhandle this.

635
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,120
Yes, all right.

636
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,000
Can you lift up on the end a little
bit? I don't know, see if that will-

637
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:28,940
- I need a hammer.
- Okay. All right.

638
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,680
- Wait a second.
- What?

639
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,500
Let me try this.

640
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,100
Yes, there you go.

641
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:52,240
Uh oh, watch out Mike, just
easy does it, don't hurt yourself.

642
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:56,200
- Okay, it's not working.
- Well, we need a hammer.

643
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:00,810
That ain't working. Let's figure
out another way to do this, okay?

644
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,520
- You hit your face?
- Yes, fucking busted my nose open.

645
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,709
Okay. This is - we're
going to get a

646
00:44:09,909 --> 00:44:12,104
fucking hammer, like we're gonna need.

647
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,460
All right.

648
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,820
- Well it didn't hit the window.
- [laughs]

649
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,200
That's so heavy, Mike.

650
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,605
It's going to have to
yank it off with the-

651
00:44:33,805 --> 00:44:35,705
-Yes, we're just move it forward here.

652
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,420
Fuck. That's what you wanted Mike?

653
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:45,220
Yes, well I wanted to do it with that.

654
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,760
Motherfucker.

655
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,760
- He needs my jump. Hold on Mike.
- Let me give you a jump.

656
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,220
- Let me give you a jump.
- I don't need a jump.

657
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:08,080
- All right.
- Okay, maybe I'll get us there.

658
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,480
Man that was some crazy stuff, huh?
[laughs]

659
00:45:38,604 --> 00:45:40,604
[crashing noise]

660
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,260
It's stuck.

661
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:02,180
You guys need help? Are you good?

662
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,240
Yes.

663
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,820
- Mike, where are your lights at?
- Let's set those up.

664
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,560
Staying up here just keeps the-

665
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:29,300
- All right. Sorry about that.
I didn't mean that.

666
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,660
Okay, forward.

667
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:46,080
Beautiful. Yes, good job man.
All right, we got that taken care of.

668
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,660
You guys missed a little excitement. Mike
was doing some welding, a spark flew off,

669
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:02,520
hit the blanket and started a fire.
I go, uh oh. The first thing was,

670
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,600
what do I do? How do I take
care of this problem, right?

671
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,167
The only thing I could think
of was ice. I got a bag

672
00:47:09,367 --> 00:47:12,600
of ice and I just dumped
it right on that blanket.

673
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,020
Then I thought I just wasted a
bag of ice that was not so smart but

674
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:22,500
I think that Mike got a little bit upset as
well. He threw his glasses in there and his

675
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,720
earmuffs or whatever and it's out.

676
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:31,580
This rocket, every time I've tested
it, or the time I jumped four years ago,

677
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,938
we took it apart right afterward.
We took the

678
00:47:34,138 --> 00:47:36,780
rocket nozzle off just knowing
what had happened there

679
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,652
and check the parts there the course of

680
00:47:38,852 --> 00:47:40,760
the parachutes were hanging
out of it everything

681
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,200
and just knowing what
this thing - it was exhausted.

682
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,364
It exhausted all the water vapor
out of it, it exhausted me.

683
00:47:48,564 --> 00:47:49,720
It exhausted itself,

684
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,820
and there's a certain,
there's something to that.

685
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:56,777
It reminds me of a
friend of mine told me,

686
00:47:56,977 --> 00:47:59,327
“We're supposed to come
to the end of our lives,

687
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,600
not with anything left but everything
exhausted. The tires are blown out,

688
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,340
you're out of gasoline,
you're coming to a screeching halt

689
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:09,020
and you've done everything
you can possibly do.

690
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,220
I guess there is some sense to that.

691
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,006
Anyway, we've got
someone coming up the road

692
00:48:14,206 --> 00:48:15,656
here, I don't know who it is.

693
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,620
Hopefully, it's not anyone official.

694
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,500
I'm tired of dealing with people.

695
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,760
And it is.

696
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:27,820
How’re you doing?

697
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:28,890
Fine buddy.

698
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:31,060
I heard you're going to
try again for this Saturday.

699
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:34,240
I just wanted to come out and see exactly
where so we didn't have any conflicts

700
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,740
- with the other properties.
- Oh yes, so

701
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,610
They relooked at the
property, of course, and

702
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:40,250
in fact even weirder he
says "Michael, at the edge of the prop-"

703
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:43,225
Charlie's the one who
used to run everything

704
00:48:43,425 --> 00:48:45,750
- for the most part for Albert here at Amboy.
- Mmmmhhm.

705
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:47,663
He was his righthand man,
now he's just hanging

706
00:48:47,863 --> 00:48:49,350
around in Barstow
running his restaurant.

707
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:50,351
Okay.

708
00:48:50,551 --> 00:48:53,330
He said even at the edge of this property
there's an abandoned car at the very edge

709
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,640
of this property. It has been there since
1963. Someone was killed in the car.

710
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,810
He thinks they hijacked
him for the gold he had.

711
00:48:59,010 --> 00:48:59,810
Oh, really?

712
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:00,811
Yes.

713
00:49:01,011 --> 00:49:03,371
They checked all this
property, this is the best way

714
00:49:03,571 --> 00:49:05,660
to build the road and
that's what they did.

715
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:06,661
Okay.

716
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:08,600
We needed a flat place and
that's where we're at.

717
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,930
We're actually going to go vertical up.

718
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:10,931
Okay.

719
00:49:11,131 --> 00:49:13,640
That way there's not, just like
I send an email to everyone,

720
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,240
there's a buffer for everywhere.

721
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,241
Okay.

722
00:49:16,441 --> 00:49:18,040
We just want to
get through this and move on.

723
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,041
Well, yes.

724
00:49:19,241 --> 00:49:20,750
So, it looks like this is all
on private property.

725
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:21,751
Oh, it is.

726
00:49:21,951 --> 00:49:23,790
- It's all off BLM so
- Yes.

727
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:25,595
I just wanted to come
out here and just make

728
00:49:25,795 --> 00:49:28,150
sure that there weren't
any issues with BLM Property.

729
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:29,151
Right.

730
00:49:29,351 --> 00:49:31,170
Well, good luck and I wish you well.

731
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:33,220
Okay, buddy, thank you for your time.

732
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:38,328
I've had people come up
here while I'm digging

733
00:49:38,528 --> 00:49:40,430
holes here 4 months
ago, on my hands and

734
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:41,431
knees, okay?

735
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,978
And they're asking me, “Can
I give you my number

736
00:49:44,178 --> 00:49:46,360
and you can text me
were you getting ready

737
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,360
to jump?”

738
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,361
Really?

739
00:49:48,561 --> 00:49:49,604
Yes, I'm going to stop
what I'm doing and text

740
00:49:49,804 --> 00:49:50,669
about 50 people who
wants to come out and

741
00:49:50,869 --> 00:49:53,370
see me where I'm asking
for people not even be here.

742
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:56,640
It's bizarre, it's bizarre.

743
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:00,051
We made a lot of progress
this morning, getting

744
00:50:00,251 --> 00:50:03,320
the ramp in a position
to lay the other rails

745
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,150
on to it so now we're just waiting
on the crane to help us out really.

746
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:09,890
So what are we getting here?

747
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:17,970
I think water and ice and a propane
little tank for maybe grilling something.

748
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,560
They have water.

749
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,020
Do you have ice here?

750
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,390
No we don't.

751
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:31,590
Okay, so we know that.

752
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:32,970
Do you need a bag?

753
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:33,970
A bag for what?

754
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:34,971
Do you need a bag of ice?

755
00:50:35,171 --> 00:50:37,810
Yes. I need a bunch of ice if you can.

756
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:40,530
- How many do you need?
- A lot.

757
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:43,910
I only got about four bags,
I can give you two of them at my place.

758
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:45,610
- Oh, really?
- Really!

759
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:47,610
- That's pretty cool.
- We'll take those two.

760
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:50,310
When I get done here, I'll go get them
and bring them back over to you.

761
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:53,610
- You will, will you? Okay. That's awesome.
- Thank you so much, really appreciate it.

762
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:54,611
I'm here to help.

763
00:50:54,811 --> 00:50:58,210
- You're awesome and you only have-
- Don't let it go to my head.

764
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:01,560
- Well, only God is awesome, really.
- You're good. How's that?

765
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,420
- [laughs]
- Will you take that one?

766
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:05,421
Okay.

767
00:51:05,621 --> 00:51:06,860
All right, great.

768
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:11,410
Amboy California rocket launch.

769
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:16,120
Bunch of these shirts right here.

770
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:23,410
And they have the neat Route 66 logo
in the front. Oooooo!

771
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:29,590
Neat, huh? So yeah, this is pretty cool.
And uh, I think if-

772
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:36,180
You want them maybe signed, Mad
Mike himself can sign them for you.

773
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:43,036
But they're only $20.
So get them while they're hot!

774
00:51:45,161 --> 00:51:51,130
Because I think February 3rd all these
are going to be gone without a doubt.

775
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:04,280
[background noise]

776
00:52:30,185 --> 00:52:32,185
This needs to be scooted this way.

777
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:38,770
Why isn't it going up?

778
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:41,650
Okay, there it goes.

779
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:49,670
Hey, Waldo, how are you doing?

780
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:51,980
- Good.
- Yes, good!

781
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:53,490
We're getting it.

782
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:54,730
It's good.

783
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:01,580
- He knows what he's doing. I know.
- Yep. Yep. Yep.

784
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:04,847
Now, what we got to do is,
we lash the whole thing together,

785
00:53:05,047 --> 00:53:08,240
then we lift the whole rocket
up, and slide it in here.

786
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,590
Yes, that's fine.

787
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,630
Okay, cool.

788
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,550
- Yeah, unwrap it. Take your time.
- Get all the shit clear.

789
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,460
- Here I'll help.
- Let me get up there and help.

790
00:53:49,589 --> 00:53:53,126
It almost looks like we know
what we're doing, you know? [Laughs]

791
00:53:57,302 --> 00:53:58,884
Almost.

792
00:54:00,881 --> 00:54:05,443
Let the crane do the work. Let's go.
Get ready. It's going to happen now.

793
00:54:05,643 --> 00:54:06,712
Come on!

794
00:54:07,129 --> 00:54:08,392
Let him lift it.

795
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,874
Easy. That's it.

796
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,673
Waldo, remind me to
recheck all this stuff

797
00:54:13,873 --> 00:54:15,690
tomorrow, Okay? I was in a hurry.
Please?

798
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:16,910
Okay.

799
00:54:19,421 --> 00:54:22,130
Thursday we put the water
and start heating all Friday.

800
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:23,430
Launch, Saturday.

801
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:25,280
We're there.
It's going to happen.

802
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,615
Yes.

803
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:28,415
What a fucking nightmare, huh?

804
00:54:29,335 --> 00:54:31,836
[laughter]

805
00:54:36,323 --> 00:54:40,049
[music]

806
00:54:54,617 --> 00:54:56,335
Man, what a day yesterday.

807
00:54:56,535 --> 00:54:58,491
You got that right.

808
00:54:59,132 --> 00:55:03,757
I have never seen so much stuff
to get done in six hours.

809
00:55:04,386 --> 00:55:06,851
That was a lot.

810
00:55:08,522 --> 00:55:13,507
Mike we have footage of
the lunar eclipse last night

811
00:55:13,707 --> 00:55:16,088
- Okay
- Which is the Earth's shadow, hitting

812
00:55:16,288 --> 00:55:20,840
the moon, from the sun from being back
behind the globe.

813
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,999
So you don't know what the
flat Earth explanation is?

814
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:28,550
Once again it's perception.

815
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:32,512
Some people think in the
flat Earth the moment

816
00:55:32,712 --> 00:55:37,390
that basically the moon
is just a disk facing us.

817
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:39,540
I don't know.

818
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:43,380
That's really interesting because
belief dictates behavior, right?

819
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,140
It does.

820
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:49,797
People may be walking
around in a false reality.

821
00:55:50,402 --> 00:55:52,010
Okay. Read what's in that right there.

822
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:54,650
One of the first ingredients.

823
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:57,260
High fructose corn syrup.

824
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:58,800
Your body don't know what to do with it.

825
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,490
How about with that sweeteners from
aborted fetuses and stuff?

826
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:05,100
I mean, that's in food and everything.

827
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,988
That's some really,
it is crazy, isn't it?

828
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,620
I don't subscribe to the flat Earth.

829
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:17,479
This whole flat Earth thing made
this whole thing a bit popular.

830
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:19,760
But I don't like to be played.

831
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,710
I don't like to be played
as a tool or whatever

832
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:26,710
and to believe stuff that isn't real.

833
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:30,879
To find the truth, a good
place to start would

834
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:34,870
be to look in the Bible
and to research some

835
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:36,990
of the things that are said there.

836
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:42,100
The word firmament is in
the Bible many many times.

837
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,530
It's sort of a snow globe analogy.

838
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:49,960
The sky, the stars, and the heavens,

839
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,720
Outer space essentially.

840
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,985
That's all encapsulated
in this thing that the

841
00:56:55,185 --> 00:56:58,250
King James Version refers
to as the firmament.

842
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:03,070
It leads people to the intelligent
design model of the universe.

843
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:07,166
This is Hebrews 11:1, Now faith

844
00:57:07,366 --> 00:57:11,842
faith is the substance,

845
00:57:13,241 --> 00:57:18,107
it's real, you can hold
on to it, right?

846
00:57:18,387 --> 00:57:21,190
Of things hoped for.

847
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:26,490
The evidence of things not seen.

848
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:30,028
Do you get what I'm saying?

849
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:35,340
That's Hebrews 11:1. I think
it's a very powerful verse.

850
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,920
It's beyond us.

851
00:57:39,928 --> 00:57:41,703
See you, Mike!

852
00:57:43,276 --> 00:57:45,401
With no services out there
in Amboy, you think

853
00:57:45,601 --> 00:57:49,210
that you bring everything, but
then you run out of stuff.

854
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:54,136
You need extra stuff or whatever
and it's back and forth, back and forth.

855
00:57:57,669 --> 00:58:00,519
How long it will you
take you to fill that thing?

856
00:58:00,781 --> 00:58:03,154
Look at all these tanks here.
It's pretty cool, huh?

857
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:11,082
Do you know if they sell those little
propane bottles, for a barbecue?

858
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:19,070
I need ten of these, and four
or five of these.

859
00:58:19,641 --> 00:58:20,891
I'm going to buy you out.

860
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:22,637
I'm going to get them
all, eight of them.

861
00:58:22,837 --> 00:58:24,790
I wonder what these things are.

862
00:58:26,517 --> 00:58:27,990
[laughs].

863
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:30,510
Oh, boy, huh?

864
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:32,659
This is so cool.

865
00:58:32,859 --> 00:58:34,950
It used to be peace out in the old days.

866
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:36,120
Now it's peace in, okay?

867
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,150
Yes, my man.

868
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:38,180
Peace in guys.

869
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:39,181
Pass it on man.

870
00:58:39,381 --> 00:58:41,066
If you guys need anything else
you know where to find us.

871
00:58:41,266 --> 00:58:42,058
- You betcha.
- Take care.

872
00:58:42,258 --> 00:58:43,070
All right, we'll see you.

873
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:45,593
Yes!
[laughs]

874
00:58:45,793 --> 00:58:48,041
I think a steel cable is
the way to go, don't you?

875
00:58:48,241 --> 00:58:51,800
I mean, this is important.
A life is on the line.

876
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,290
Where's your beer at?

877
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:54,560
Just one twelve pack?

878
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,160
Some kind of organic
crackers or what have you?

879
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,960
This stuff can go in juices too.

880
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,250
I got spinach.

881
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:02,530
I got a whole bunch of spinach.

882
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:04,882
I got two things of spinach.

883
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,878
I do.

884
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,181
Here we go.

885
00:59:10,381 --> 00:59:12,210
We found something!

886
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:15,326
That's what we're looking for, right?
[laughs]

887
00:59:15,526 --> 00:59:17,727
Peace in to you. It's not peace
out anymore. It's peace in.

888
00:59:17,927 --> 00:59:18,860
Peace in?

889
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:20,685
- Yes, it's peace in. Pass it on, okay?
- I will.

890
00:59:20,885 --> 00:59:21,957
All right.

891
00:59:29,152 --> 00:59:32,720
If it heats, nothing will stop it.

892
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:33,721
Think about that.

893
00:59:33,921 --> 00:59:36,381
You're doing 100 miles an
hour, boom you launch,

894
00:59:36,581 --> 00:59:38,820
you climb in fact,
you're going to arc over

895
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:39,880
my head a little bit.

896
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:43,451
You climb, you stall, your engine
cuts out a couple of seconds later.

897
00:59:43,651 --> 00:59:45,818
Now you are going to go
higher, you'll still

898
00:59:46,018 --> 00:59:49,080
climb, that's when
you'll start coming back.

899
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,480
What will happen is everything,
you'll tunnel vision.

900
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,538
In fact, you'll get two
little tunnels that go like

901
00:59:53,738 --> 00:59:55,390
this like you're looking
through binoculars.

902
00:59:55,590 --> 01:00:00,130
Then once it comes off
power, it will come back.

903
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:01,250
Look for the ground.

904
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:02,250
You'll know.

905
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:03,251
You'll know when you stop.

906
01:00:03,451 --> 01:00:06,350
You quit climbing, and
then you stop for a second.

907
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:08,030
If you're climbing
straight up, which you

908
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:09,870
could be because even
though we've got a tilt

909
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:15,650
on it, it might act like a model rocket
where it comes off and makes squirly

910
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:16,810
stuff and then climbs up.

911
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:17,880
It could do that.

912
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,169
When it stalls, you'll stop.

913
01:00:20,369 --> 01:00:22,108
It'll fall back like a
hammerhead stall like

914
01:00:22,308 --> 01:00:23,960
an aircraft does when
you're doing stunts.

915
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,700
It'll fall like this and it'll go.

916
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:28,870
When it does that, boom, hit the chutes.

917
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:29,870
One, two.

918
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:30,871
One, two.

919
01:00:31,071 --> 01:00:33,510
Do not use one.

920
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:35,120
Use two.

921
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:39,460
You're counting on something 10
years old to save your life, use two.

922
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:41,314
They won't jam up.

923
01:00:42,627 --> 01:00:45,800
You're planning on using
one chute, aren't you?

924
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,329
Well, it depends on how it comes
down initially.

925
01:00:47,529 --> 01:00:48,468
I knew it.

926
01:00:48,668 --> 01:00:50,896
- Depends on how it comes down.
- If it feels like I'm coming down slow.

927
01:00:51,096 --> 01:00:54,547
I wouldn't use one chute. You can do
it if you want. It's your life, man.

928
01:00:54,747 --> 01:00:57,314
Another thing too is you
don't have the hammock seat

929
01:00:57,514 --> 01:01:00,064
so you're going to take
all the loads of the impact.

930
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:05,850
If you use that back chute, she's
going to be hanging straight down.

931
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:07,232
Pop!

932
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:11,850
You know what, I'll tell you, if you
use one chute, it's not a good idea.

933
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:15,011
But if I were you, what I
would do is, put my feet

934
01:01:15,211 --> 01:01:18,240
against the floorboards,
put my head up against

935
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,190
the back 'cause you're going to hit like
a motherfucker.

936
01:01:22,866 --> 01:01:26,062
Sunday, your life is different.

937
01:01:26,789 --> 01:01:28,727
Sunday.

938
01:01:33,037 --> 01:01:35,012
Now, if we can get people
out of here, we're

939
01:01:35,212 --> 01:01:36,769
probably going to do it
before the ambulance shows up,

940
01:01:36,969 --> 01:01:38,494
like maybe noon or one o'clock.

941
01:01:38,694 --> 01:01:41,290
Someone starts circulating that it ain't
going to happen today.

942
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:43,130
No, we're not saying that it's not
going to happen.

943
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:44,480
But we don't want people by the
side of the road!

944
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:45,600
I want people to leave.

945
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:46,601
No, listen.

946
01:01:46,801 --> 01:01:48,070
We cannot say that it's
not going to happen today.

947
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:49,190
That's a lie.

948
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:50,191
I don't lie.

949
01:01:50,391 --> 01:01:53,350
Okay. Well, Pat, you got to
realize I don't want anyone here.

950
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:55,350
- I understand.
- Believe me.

951
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:58,130
I'll put that caution tape all
the way through so it's handled.

952
01:01:58,330 --> 01:01:59,830
Well it depends, if
there's 1000, 2000 people

953
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:01,740
on the side of this
road, it ain't handled.

954
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:03,770
There ain't going to be no 2000 people.

955
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,400
I mean, shoot, you only have $65
on GoFundMe.

956
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,410
Really, you think that the
whole world's looking at you?

957
01:02:09,610 --> 01:02:10,610
I don't think so!

958
01:02:11,689 --> 01:02:13,256
All I know is there's
been people from about

959
01:02:13,456 --> 01:02:15,030
6 to 10 different
countries come out here.

960
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:17,230
Yes, well, ya know, we'll see.

961
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:21,230
Something else you need to be
concerned about with is my safety, Pat.

962
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:24,580
My safety, someone may come out
with a fucking gun to shoot me.

963
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:27,750
Hey, wait a second, Mike.

964
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:29,030
Wait.

965
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:31,220
I just want to be clear, okay?

966
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:35,217
And I understand what you're
saying and believe you me,

967
01:02:35,417 --> 01:02:38,880
throughout this entire
process, your safety

968
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:44,690
has been my major concern in
every single way, shape, and form.

969
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:46,995
Someone could come here
with some weird thing

970
01:02:47,195 --> 01:02:49,300
and they could shoot the
rocket, they could

971
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,610
They're going to be all over here.

972
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:52,790
I promise.

973
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:53,840
I will make that promise.

974
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,820
If I have to be out here,
I'll make sure about it.

975
01:02:57,020 --> 01:03:00,580
Well, when people are wishing me dead,
I take that pretty seriously.

976
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:04,746
I guess they're going to have to
come through me first. How's that?

977
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:25,399
Pat, I'm going to put you in charge
of putting the water in the rocket.

978
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:28,380
Me and Mike, I'm going
to carry up the welder.

979
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:29,440
I brought the little welder.

980
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,441
It's here.

981
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:31,960
You're going to weld the other things.

982
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,109
Can you climb?
Are you going to be okay?

983
01:03:34,309 --> 01:03:35,121
I don't know.

984
01:03:35,321 --> 01:03:37,811
- Okay, well here's what I'll do.
- I'll go up there.

985
01:03:38,011 --> 01:03:40,494
I'll put the welder up there.
I'll hang it.

986
01:03:40,694 --> 01:03:42,070
Lord, Father, help me.

987
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:46,979
Give me the strength I need
to pull this shit off.

988
01:03:49,089 --> 01:03:52,547
We just got to balls up and go up there and
weld or trust me to weld it, I'll weld it.

989
01:03:52,747 --> 01:03:55,847
You always bitch about my weldings, so
I don't want to hear it.

990
01:04:11,544 --> 01:04:14,128
Nice job, Pat.

991
01:04:14,328 --> 01:04:16,219
I got to check the perimeter.

992
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:18,000
Who gives a shit what he believes?

993
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,050
He's launching something pretty cool.

994
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:23,224
This is America.
We can believe whatever we want.

995
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:28,301
Interesting theory but,
hey, get up there,

996
01:04:28,501 --> 01:04:31,669
find me some proof and
I'll become a believer

997
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:35,230
because this guy's really the true
Rocketman, not the guy in Korea.

998
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:39,260
If he's successful, Amboy will
always be known as Rocket Town.

999
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:42,800
- Let's get the water in the rocket.
- Yes, let's get the water.

1000
01:04:47,906 --> 01:04:49,890
- You okay, Waldo?
- Yes, I'm okay.

1001
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:53,510
I'll never use this hand
again, but I'm okay.

1002
01:04:55,051 --> 01:04:57,343
Stick it down in there, Mike.

1003
01:05:01,869 --> 01:05:04,745
- It's going to take a little while.
- Yes.

1004
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,990
The reason I love steam rockets so
much is they're just so stinking simple.

1005
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:19,021
I just love the fact
that you can get that

1006
01:05:19,221 --> 01:05:21,240
much propulsion out of
nothing more than water

1007
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,020
that's heated up that hot.

1008
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:26,590
Water has the unique ability
to store so much heat.

1009
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:30,970
You could do it with liquid carbon dioxide
but getting liquid carbon dioxide is a heck

1010
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:33,165
of a lot more complicated
than just opening

1011
01:05:33,365 --> 01:05:35,409
the faucet and filling
the thing with water.

1012
01:05:35,609 --> 01:05:39,550
This bottle right here is the last gallon
you're going to put into the rocket.

1013
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:41,965
I have a few drops of
water, that's holy water,

1014
01:05:42,165 --> 01:05:44,380
blessed by the Pope that
came from the Vatican.

1015
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:47,510
It's powered by the faith
of the Catholic Church.

1016
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:50,623
So when you put that in there, I'm hoping
it's going to add a little bit more

1017
01:05:50,823 --> 01:05:52,159
good luck to the project.

1018
01:05:52,359 --> 01:05:55,690
- Yes, we could use all of it.
- [laughs] I hear you.

1019
01:05:57,959 --> 01:05:59,190
Don't spill it.

1020
01:06:00,926 --> 01:06:02,853
Yes, we're going out
to the main road, put

1021
01:06:03,053 --> 01:06:04,790
up our barricades to
keep the public out.

1022
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:09,120
That's what Waldo and Mike asked me, at
least, people be back a quarter mile.

1023
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:12,748
That's close to a half mile on the
highway and that'll be just great.

1024
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:16,917
There we go. They know where
to come in. All right, back to the

1025
01:06:17,117 --> 01:06:19,216
- Back to drawing board
- Launch pad.

1026
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:36,743
That's all there is to it.

1027
01:06:51,159 --> 01:06:52,960
Now, it's all a matter of time.

1028
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:57,409
After the water hits 212 degrees, it'll
start turning into steam.

1029
01:06:57,609 --> 01:07:00,839
Then a few hours after that, it'll
start making really good pressure.

1030
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:03,112
Then he gets in and goes.

1031
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:21,800
I'm a science teacher.

1032
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,540
I teach at probably the closest
middle school to this place.

1033
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:29,010
Flat Earthers, they give knowledge
something to push off of.

1034
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:31,080
They're getting people to question.

1035
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,669
Hopefully, the real science
flies like a rocket.

1036
01:07:34,869 --> 01:07:36,828
If the moon's going
around in a circle, there

1037
01:07:37,028 --> 01:07:38,940
has to be a force that
makes it go in there.

1038
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:41,260
Why can't it just be
angels suspending it all?

1039
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:42,784
Why can't it be what?

1040
01:07:42,984 --> 01:07:47,553
Angels or why can't it be magic or God?

1041
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:54,723
Well, Kurt Vonnegut
said science is magic that works.

1042
01:07:54,981 --> 01:07:57,900
Like Mike, he had a scale rocket
he tested.

1043
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:00,314
He believes in science
because I know he has

1044
01:08:00,514 --> 01:08:02,620
force divided by mass
equals acceleration.

1045
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:07,240
Whether he walks away from this,
it's going to be based on science.

1046
01:08:11,765 --> 01:08:12,966
That's it.

1047
01:08:15,014 --> 01:08:17,564
- Danny, this is my daughter Stephanie.
- No way, hi!

1048
01:08:17,764 --> 01:08:19,231
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you!

1049
01:08:19,431 --> 01:08:21,510
There's never a dull moment with him
as my father.

1050
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:24,490
He's always doing some crazy project.

1051
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:30,950
This isn't his dream but he sees that same
thing in Mike and I think that he's here to

1052
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:33,389
support that as best as he can.

1053
01:08:33,589 --> 01:08:35,527
That's my biggest fear
today is that something

1054
01:08:35,727 --> 01:08:38,993
goes awry and he holds
it on his conscience.

1055
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:41,800
This one here on the side.

1056
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,804
When it comes down to
that last few moments,

1057
01:08:44,004 --> 01:08:47,948
there's going to be some hesitation,
I don't care how tough you are.

1058
01:08:55,857 --> 01:08:59,180
We came out to watch the rocket launch.

1059
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:02,329
A lot of people's got the idea
that he's just some kind of a nut.

1060
01:09:02,529 --> 01:09:06,215
This is the Wright
Brothers all over again

1061
01:09:06,415 --> 01:09:09,650
but it's 2018. This
is amazing stuff.

1062
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:12,110
Give it a little tap.

1063
01:09:13,687 --> 01:09:16,261
Danny, it's 150. The rocket's now taboo.

1064
01:09:16,461 --> 01:09:18,199
Tell everybody, okay?

1065
01:09:21,472 --> 01:09:23,869
None of you are allowed past this tent.

1066
01:09:24,069 --> 01:09:25,869
This is why.
It's a bomb.

1067
01:09:26,069 --> 01:09:28,889
It could spring a leak and it'll
explode so fast it'll tear you apart.

1068
01:09:29,089 --> 01:09:31,269
It'll kill everybody within
a few hundred feet of it.

1069
01:09:31,469 --> 01:09:34,023
Remember, that's a bomb.

1070
01:09:38,063 --> 01:09:40,540
All right, so I just got to
pull the pin on the big chute.

1071
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:43,820
You're going to pull the pins on those
inside and hand them to me, right?

1072
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:44,821
Yes.

1073
01:09:45,021 --> 01:09:47,220
I'll tap on the canopy and when
I tell you that,

1074
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:48,520
we're going to pull
the blue thing away.

1075
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:51,330
If there's any problem
It don't even seem real.

1076
01:09:54,725 --> 01:09:56,140
What do I do if shit goes south?

1077
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:58,970
Did you leave a letter or something?

1078
01:09:59,170 --> 01:10:01,252
What the fuck do you want me to do?

1079
01:10:04,077 --> 01:10:07,480
If worse comes to worst, do you
want me to give your shit to your son?

1080
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:11,040
Your son, okay. Whichever
son shows up, right? Okay.

1081
01:10:38,054 --> 01:10:40,502
We're about ready to make
some fucking history here.

1082
01:10:40,702 --> 01:10:42,615
That's what we're going to do.

1083
01:10:59,035 --> 01:11:03,015
You are armed and dangerous.
Are you ready?

1084
01:11:03,215 --> 01:11:06,065
I guess so.

1085
01:11:06,265 --> 01:11:08,283
I'm going to close the son of a bitch.

1086
01:11:11,844 --> 01:11:14,291
Here we go.
I'm leaving you now, okay?

1087
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:21,850
Take it to your right. Okay, Pat, let
it fall on your side. Let it go.

1088
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:23,681
Stay clear of it.
Let it fall.

1089
01:11:24,856 --> 01:11:26,090
Let's get out of here.

1090
01:11:26,290 --> 01:11:28,554
Let's go, Mike!

1091
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:33,170
- Come on, Mike.
- Hang in there, buddy.

1092
01:11:36,515 --> 01:11:37,462
We're all clear?

1093
01:11:37,662 --> 01:11:41,801
- Mike, launchpad is clear.
- Godspeed, my buddy. Take care.

1094
01:11:49,237 --> 01:11:52,269
- Oh, shit!
- Hey, tell him to hold one second.

1095
01:11:52,469 --> 01:11:55,360
Tell him to hold one second!
Tell him to hold one second!

1096
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,100
Mike, hold one second.

1097
01:11:59,272 --> 01:12:03,588
Waldo, he didn't acknowledge.
Get out of there!

1098
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:17,023
You're clear, Mike.
Go for it.

1099
01:12:26,938 --> 01:12:28,441
Mike, what is going on?

1100
01:12:29,241 --> 01:12:32,103
- [unintelligible]
- What did he say?

1101
01:12:32,407 --> 01:12:33,542
Say again.

1102
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:42,342
Mike, you got a copy?

1103
01:12:43,041 --> 01:12:45,095
It's not releasing!

1104
01:12:45,883 --> 01:12:49,130
I don't know what to do.
The ball valve is stuck!

1105
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,006
Did it move at all?

1106
01:12:52,206 --> 01:12:57,839
- No, it's stuck. [Unintelligible]
- Say again.

1107
01:12:58,039 --> 01:13:01,050
I think if it hasn't fired
by now, it's not going to fire!

1108
01:13:02,226 --> 01:13:05,640
- Okay.
- I'm going to come get you.

1109
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,499
Shit, I'm going to regret this.

1110
01:13:09,002 --> 01:13:10,919
- We're going to get him out of there.
- It's on hold right now.

1111
01:13:11,119 --> 01:13:13,220
Okay. What's the chance
of it blowing right now?

1112
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:15,220
- A lot!
- A lot?

1113
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:18,220
- Seriously. Honestly.
- Yes, I know. That's why

1114
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:21,758
What about, is there any way to
relieve pressure from somewhere else?

1115
01:13:21,958 --> 01:13:24,607
There's no safe way
to discharge this from inside

1116
01:13:24,807 --> 01:13:27,291
or I would already have done it.

1117
01:13:27,803 --> 01:13:31,480
Okay. Hang tight. We're going to
get the ramp up and get you out.

1118
01:13:32,321 --> 01:13:36,233
Get on that. Turn your back
in case the fucker launches.

1119
01:13:37,195 --> 01:13:38,600
- Relax.
- Don't jerk!

1120
01:13:39,295 --> 01:13:42,595
- Fucking give me a fucking break, would you?
- I'm sorry, Waldo.

1121
01:13:42,795 --> 01:13:45,472
I'm getting you out of a
fucking armed rocket.

1122
01:13:45,672 --> 01:13:48,890
Hold onto the back of my neck. Hold onto
my shoulders. I'm going to pull you out.

1123
01:13:49,090 --> 01:13:50,890
- Ready?
- No, no, no!

1124
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:52,855
- Be careful.
- Don't bitch. Come on.

1125
01:13:53,055 --> 01:13:56,655
Fucking do not touch that rocket.
I couldn't unarm that guy.

1126
01:13:56,855 --> 01:13:59,745
- Come on.
- Hoist me out.

1127
01:13:59,945 --> 01:14:01,990
Dude. Come on out. Here you go.

1128
01:14:02,190 --> 01:14:04,190
Step up on the platform.
Come on.

1129
01:14:05,515 --> 01:14:07,260
That was my worst fucking nightmare.

1130
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:11,283
- Get me away from this motherfucker!
- Okay. Hold on. Hold on.

1131
01:14:16,297 --> 01:14:21,406
- We won't be doing this today.
- The piston's locked inside.

1132
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,247
Back up, please!

1133
01:14:23,447 --> 01:14:25,430
The pistons locked inside
the rocket nozzle.

1134
01:14:25,630 --> 01:14:28,400
Come on, walk it off.

1135
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:32,862
I thought maybe I left in the plug
for the vent because it will not fire

1136
01:14:33,062 --> 01:14:34,844
if the vent's plugged.

1137
01:14:37,384 --> 01:14:39,600
I kept pulling and pulling.
It was behind my helmet.

1138
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:42,390
I finally got it through the tie
strap and there was no vent on it.

1139
01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:46,701
- That one rocket is still armed.
- Okay?

1140
01:14:51,402 --> 01:14:55,730
We're going to have to do
some reengineering here.

1141
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:59,641
What we got to do is, here's what we do.
We let the rocket cool down.

1142
01:14:59,841 --> 01:15:02,590
When it's down to
The Piston's stuck in the nozzle.

1143
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:06,280
I can't get it. I've armed it five
times. I yanked on the ball valve,

1144
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,390
I turned the, it's got
the proper pressure.

1145
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:11,025
Shit. Just kill me.

1146
01:16:04,789 --> 01:16:13,853
Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, three, two, one!

1147
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:15,716
Ignition.

1148
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:19,345
Liftoff. Go Falcon Heavy.

1149
01:16:19,545 --> 01:16:24,409
[applause]

1150
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:58,300
My life is basically
stopped until this happens.

1151
01:16:58,500 --> 01:16:59,830
Everything I got is into this thing.

1152
01:17:00,030 --> 01:17:02,908
I'm in the World Series Poker.
I'm at the final table, okay?

1153
01:17:03,108 --> 01:17:04,660
And all my chips are pushed in.

1154
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:08,135
I tell you that because I don't have my
rent money right now.

1155
01:17:08,335 --> 01:17:09,550
I was laid off from my job last Friday.

1156
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:11,210
I don't have a car.

1157
01:17:11,410 --> 01:17:13,240
Everything's on that
ramp right now, okay?

1158
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:17,820
So I'm going to take pretty big offense
to anyone who thinks I chickened out

1159
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:20,600
or didn't want to see this happen.
I've got to do this.

1160
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,070
Everything I've got is
in that rocket right now.

1161
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:26,170
So what happened is the actuator last
time was a little too small.

1162
01:17:26,370 --> 01:17:27,970
It wouldn't launch.
It didn't have the power.

1163
01:17:28,170 --> 01:17:31,070
Now, he's gone to a bigger actuator
which was set at four inches in diameter.

1164
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:32,460
Now it's six inches diameter.

1165
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:36,090
It's double the size so the
rocket should fire today.

1166
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:38,330
I got the whole inside of the
cockpit foamed and taped.

1167
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:41,539
'Cause, when he builds
things, he has bolts sticking out.

1168
01:17:41,739 --> 01:17:43,385
He doesn't realize when
he's going to hit so

1169
01:17:43,585 --> 01:17:45,190
hard, all this stuff
becomes a razor blade.

1170
01:17:45,390 --> 01:17:48,500
It'd be silly that he survives the launch
and everything happens and then he hits the

1171
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:50,708
ground and gets opened
up and bleeds out before

1172
01:17:50,908 --> 01:17:52,640
we get to him, so all
that stuff is foamed

1173
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,550
up the best I could figure out.

1174
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:58,297
I have lived with Waldo
and his rocket adventures

1175
01:17:58,497 --> 01:18:00,880
all these years, 20 years
almost, but to actually

1176
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:04,890
see a launch, I haven't
been a part of that.

1177
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:09,440
If anything happens to Mike, I
just didn't want that in my head.

1178
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,710
For some reason, today, I
just thought, "You know what?

1179
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:12,740
Today's the day.

1180
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:13,741
I need to come out."

1181
01:18:13,941 --> 01:18:14,960
I forgot my lucky jacket.

1182
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:17,980
It's time we're going
to rock and roll now.

1183
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:21,800
I can't launch a rocket or do
something crazy without lucky jacket.

1184
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,590
God does work in mysterious ways
especially here in the desert.

1185
01:18:25,790 --> 01:18:31,775
The whole reason for the faux pas last
time was just to get it right this time.

1186
01:18:31,975 --> 01:18:33,296
So, here we are.

1187
01:18:33,496 --> 01:18:37,452
We have all the right
stuff and it's countdown.

1188
01:18:37,652 --> 01:18:39,663
It's countdown to launch.

1189
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:43,775
Okay.

1190
01:18:49,144 --> 01:18:50,920
- Hang on.
- I got it.

1191
01:18:58,673 --> 01:19:00,001
- I'm touching.
- Too high.

1192
01:19:14,177 --> 01:19:17,427
Okay. Everyone away. Let's go!

1193
01:19:17,851 --> 01:19:19,213
All right. Here we go.

1194
01:19:22,807 --> 01:19:24,759
Everything clear?
Over.

1195
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:31,247
Is everything clear?
Over.

1196
01:19:31,859 --> 01:19:34,037
Everything is clear.
Go for it.

1197
01:20:05,378 --> 01:20:07,928
Go! Go! Go!

1198
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:24,208
[cheers]

1199
01:20:32,747 --> 01:20:37,117
- Chutes!
- Oh shit!

1200
01:20:43,357 --> 01:20:45,150
I love it!

1201
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:49,286
It's coming right down over here!

1202
01:20:56,197 --> 01:20:57,827
How am I coming down speedwise?

1203
01:20:58,027 --> 01:20:59,462
How am I coming down? Over.

1204
01:20:59,662 --> 01:21:02,289
- You're looking good.
- A little fast baby.

1205
01:21:02,868 --> 01:21:04,047
You think a little fast?

1206
01:21:04,247 --> 01:21:06,448
Chute! Say hit the chute!

1207
01:21:06,648 --> 01:21:08,485
Throw the other chute.

1208
01:21:23,493 --> 01:21:24,818
Let's go!

1209
01:21:26,662 --> 01:21:28,928
Mike, you there?
You got a copy?

1210
01:22:32,699 --> 01:22:33,860
This is something about dreams.

1211
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:36,260
It's got to be big enough to scare you.

1212
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:37,720
That's the first thing.

1213
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:40,470
And for that kind of dream,
it takes everything.

1214
01:22:40,670 --> 01:22:44,150
It takes all your time, your
income, emotionally, physically.

1215
01:22:44,350 --> 01:22:46,850
It takes everything from you.
And it's supposed to.

1216
01:22:47,257 --> 01:22:51,170
Is it worth it? I think that's
another thing I ponder every day.

1217
01:22:51,370 --> 01:22:54,587
I don't know.
We'll see in the end.

1218
01:22:59,283 --> 01:23:01,870
Mission accomplished
as self-taught rocket scientist

1219
01:23:02,070 --> 01:23:05,220
successfully launched himself into
the California sky.

1220
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:07,958
The Associated Press
reports 61 year old Mike

1221
01:23:08,158 --> 01:23:10,590
Hughes propelled himself
nearly 1900 feet into

1222
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:14,410
the air in the Mojave Desert
before landing pretty hard.

1223
01:23:14,610 --> 01:23:17,300
Other than injuring his
back, he should be fine.

1224
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,529
He says he's "relieved"
after the launch and

1225
01:23:19,729 --> 01:23:21,610
his ultimate goal is
to launch himself at

1226
01:23:21,810 --> 01:23:28,264
least 52 miles above Earth by the end of
the year to prove that the planet is flat.

1227
01:23:33,053 --> 01:23:35,595
All those naysayers were wrong,
weren't they?

1228
01:23:35,795 --> 01:23:36,960
Is that bizarre?

1229
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:38,760
You didn't want to miss that, did you?

1230
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:39,840
I wish I could've watched it.

1231
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:43,640
I'd have a stunt double but I can't find
anybody with the hair like mine.

1232
01:23:44,050 --> 01:23:46,040
You really kicked some A.

1233
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:49,120
Waldo I couldn't do it without you.

1234
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:50,330
Go, Waldo.

1235
01:23:50,530 --> 01:23:52,760
Of course, you couldn't.

1236
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,906
Now we go to space!

1237
01:23:55,940 --> 01:23:59,151
[cheering]

1238
01:24:33,268 --> 01:24:36,748
Michael Hughes, Mad Mike
to his fans, now has

1239
01:24:36,948 --> 01:24:40,890
a plan to go 62 miles up
to the edge of space

1240
01:24:41,090 --> 01:24:44,740
where he'll be able to see,
or not see the curve of Earth.

1241
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:47,337
My rocket will fire, pull me through
the balloon

1242
01:24:47,537 --> 01:24:49,990
and then actually once
the rocket quits firing

1243
01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:53,240
I will actually fly like Superman
for like another 30 seconds.

1244
01:24:54,273 --> 01:25:00,041
- [laughs]
- My favorite, barbecued moron.

1245
01:25:00,241 --> 01:25:01,950
- Where do you want me to put my money?
- I'm being honest.

1246
01:25:02,150 --> 01:25:04,910
I would think putting Mad
Mike in space for $2 million.

1247
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:07,390
You better make that motherfucker
a two seater and I want to sit in front.

1248
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:09,354
I don't want to sit behind
you because I don't

1249
01:25:09,554 --> 01:25:11,150
want the last thing of
us going into Earth

1250
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:13,575
is me penetrating through you.
[laughter]

1251
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:16,780
What would it take for me to
convince you that the world is round?

1252
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:18,820
I don't believe anyone
could convince me the

1253
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:20,769
world is round because
they have no proof.

1254
01:25:20,969 --> 01:25:22,328
Well, have you ever seen the
Queen of England?

1255
01:25:22,528 --> 01:25:24,720
- Not in person.
- Okay, then does she exist?

1256
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:25,769
I don't know.

1257
01:25:25,969 --> 01:25:30,213
Bet you've never seen the face of
a sexually satisfied woman. Burn!

1258
01:25:30,413 --> 01:25:31,849
[laughter]

1259
01:25:34,193 --> 01:25:36,145
Mad Mike, you done?
