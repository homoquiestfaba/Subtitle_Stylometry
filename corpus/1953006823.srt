1
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:58,651
- (seagulls cawing)
- (boat horn blows)

2
00:01:58,651 --> 00:01:59,675
- (seagulls cawing)
- (boat horn blows)

3
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,467
(cell phone rings)

4
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,964
I am just leaving Ice Cream Palace.

5
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,910
You'd better hurry up, 'cause I'm
getting ready to crack the first bottle.

6
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,105
What are you doing?

7
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,139
Well, I'm just hanging up these amazing
flyers that my best friend made me.

8
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:31,650
I should be getting
good at it by now.

9
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:33,845
I mean, this is
business number what?

10
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,515
I have no idea. I can't count
past 10 without my shoes off.

11
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,887
Why are you starting
without me?

12
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,551
I thought we were having
a fun girls' night.

13
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,617
I figured that we'd pop in

14
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,027
some "Sex and the City" DVDs
when you get home

15
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,793
and we can throw olives
at the screen

16
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,597
every time one of the girls gets
screwed over by some douchebag.

17
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,070
Okay, so I'm guessing
you're still not over Sean, huh?

18
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,665
It's my own fault, you know?
I should have never let you set me up

19
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,175
with one of your lowlife friends,
let alone one with a six-pack.

20
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,407
Okay, be nice. I just maxed out my credit
cards buying you Chunky Monkey.

21
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:01,811
(phone beeping)

22
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,874
I think this is my first client.
I'll see you at home.

23
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:07,517
Hello.

24
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,387
Yes, this is Wendy.

25
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,414
Yes, he's my father.

26
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,865
A heart attack.

27
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,732
Wow.

28
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,739
And you haven't seen him
or spoken to him in a long time, right?

29
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,173
Huh-uh, not since I was 12.

30
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,375
He cheated on your mom,
didn't he?

31
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,813
Yeah, she was never the same.

32
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,046
I mean, he always used to send

33
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,987
Christmas cards
and birthday cards

34
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:46,082
and my mom would just
send them back.

35
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,821
Well, at least he sent cards.

36
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,829
I mean, some dads
don't even do that.

37
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:53,263
Yeah, but sending cards...

38
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:57,235
not really a way to have
a relationship with your daughter.

39
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,499
Now I have all these papers
to sign.

40
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,067
I don't even know
why I'm crying.

41
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:08,171
Look, we'll make a girls' weekend
out of it.

42
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,411
I'll pack up all the junk food
we have in the house

43
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:15,387
and we'll get you nice and drunk
before you sign anything.

44
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,412
Sounds great.

45
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,618
Oh man, you're gonna kill me.

46
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:22,457
I left all the Chunky Monkey
in the street.

47
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,360
We'll get some more.

48
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,058
# Come on, come on #

49
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,862
# Hide and seek and find me #

50
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,561
# Come on, come on #

51
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,593
# Fast-forward, rewind me #

52
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,162
# Come on, come on #

53
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,937
# Before I'm gone gone gone #

54
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,305
# Go on, go on #

55
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,541
# Take a picture of me #

56
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,607
# Go on, go on... #

57
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,211
So I have an insensitive
question to ask.

58
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,447
Hmm?

59
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,683
Do you think you're gonna
get anything out of all this?

60
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,816
You know, I don't know.
From what I remember,

61
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,986
my dad was not so good
with money.

62
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,292
Sounds like the apple
didn't fall far from that tree.

63
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,491
Hey, I pay my rent on time.

64
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,193
Since when?

65
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,429
Okay, maybe I need to have

66
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,495
the occasional odd job to get me through
until I find something...

67
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:10,475
Wait, occasional?
Let's not rewrite history here, okay?

68
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,343
Since I've known you,
you've sold organic coffee,

69
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,280
painted landscapes,
told fortunes,

70
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,649
and my personal favorite...
juggled fire in the Castro district.

71
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,984
Hey, do you know how hard it was
to catch those batons?

72
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,581
You singed off
both of your eyebrows.

73
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:27,058
Look, my point is

74
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,084
you learned how to catch them

75
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,653
and then you moved on
to something else.

76
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,326
I'm barely in the second phase
of the grieving process

77
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,392
and you're already
barking at me.

78
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,896
I think we're close.

79
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:10,300
We just made a wrong turn
somewhere around that pizza stain,

80
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:12,327
which puts us

81
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,169
one fingernail away.

82
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,300
Okey-doke.

83
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,333
You are not still mad.

84
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,869
You called me
financially irresponsible.

85
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:23,245
Okay, fine.

86
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:26,513
I promise
under the penalty of perjury

87
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,782
to never give Wendy Rollins
monetary advice

88
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,813
unless it is expressly asked for.

89
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,917
Thank you.

90
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,020
Now go get us some trash mags
and I'll fill up your tank with gas.

91
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,587
Deal.

92
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,866
(beeps)

93
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,000
- (beeps)
- Oh, you stupid

94
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,740
devil-worshipping machine.

95
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,271
I'll give you one last chance.

96
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,942
- (beeps)
- Why?

97
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,384
You would not be beeping
if I had a hammer right now.

98
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,082
I swear to God, I would smash you
into a million pieces.

99
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,919
- Ugh.
- (beeps)

100
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:08,623
- (chimes)
- What did you just do?

101
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,563
Looked like you were having
some serious trouble.

102
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,691
I would have
figured something out.

103
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,032
Maybe try some panhandling
up at the interstate?

104
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:19,469
Hey, don't knock panhandlers.
They make more than minimum wage

105
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,473
and they don't pay taxes.

106
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,704
Well, sorry if I offended you.
I was just trying to help.

107
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,712
I see you're making friends.

108
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,043
Hi, I'm Jennifer.

109
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,479
Chris. Nice to meet you.

110
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,415
He just bought us
a tank of gas.

111
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,942
Oh, was your credit card
declined again?

112
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:36,284
I'm now officially mortified.

113
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:39,189
Well, at the risk of causing you
any more embarrassment,

114
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,557
I'd better go.
I didn't get your name.

115
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,221
You know, we're just
passing through.

116
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:46,231
And I don't really
give my name to strangers.

117
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:49,826
Okay, well, you two
have a good day.

118
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,894
- You, too.
- Bye.

119
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,575
- Ow.
- What is wrong with you?

120
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,275
- That really hurt.
- Never give your name to strangers?

121
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,477
- Really?
- What, you've never heard that before?

122
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:06,917
Um, when I was five.

123
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,615
He was nice and cute.

124
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,783
I don't care. I'm not gonna give my name
to some gas jockey.

125
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,792
Did you see his car?

126
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,731
That boy does not pump gas.

127
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,131
Seriously, you need to drop it.

128
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,159
No, not until you admit

129
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,603
you were stupid
for not getting his number.

130
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,701
Don't give me that look.
I could stand here all day.

131
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,042
Fine.

132
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,548
- I was stupid.
- Yeah, you were.

133
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,312
- You're pushing it.
- (giggles)

134
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,791
Wendy: Oh, my gosh.

135
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,770
Jennifer: Whoa. Why didn't you
tell me you were rich?

136
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,169
Wendy: I had no idea.

137
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,471
Jennifer: Well, just remember I'm your
best friend and I love you dearly.

138
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,636
Wendy: I'm sorry,
I've forgotten your name.

139
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,616
- I'm Roy Hutchinson.
- Hi.

140
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:17,987
You must be Wendy.

141
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,151
Yes. This is Jennifer.

142
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,490
- She's my entourage.
- Charmed.

143
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:24,758
Let me first offer
my condolences.

144
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,294
So what do you think?

145
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,325
It's amazing.

146
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,394
This is not
how I remember it at all.

147
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:35,066
Your father was very clear, Wendy.

148
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,166
He's left you everything...

149
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:41,043
the chateau, the winery...
everything here that you can see.

150
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,480
I don't know what to say.

151
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:47,418
I mean, my father and I
hadn't spoken in years.

152
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:48,977
Well, he spoke about you
constantly.

153
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,216
Jerry especially loved the story
about Wendy

154
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:55,057
running around the vineyards,
eating grapes and then throwing them up.

155
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,391
Yeah.

156
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,454
Let's go inside, shall we?

157
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,166
In accordance with
your father's wishes,

158
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,105
he was cremated.

159
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,700
He asked that his ashes be scattered
in the vineyard.

160
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,705
(clears throat)
Before you sign anything,

161
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,580
I thought you should know
a little bit about the chateau.

162
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:22,486
The premium label
is the Chateau Meroux merlot.

163
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:25,547
It's a bit pricey,
but consistently wins gold medals.

164
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,650
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

165
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,320
Due to the recession, however,

166
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,830
sales are less than a quarter
of what they should be.

167
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,526
The chateau has been surviving
drawing on your father's

168
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:38,025
- million-dollar line of credit.
- A million-dollar line of credit?

169
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,129
Well, it's almost as good
as a black card.

170
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,264
I don't know anything
about wine.

171
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,573
Your father didn't know
anything about wine either

172
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,602
when he first started.

173
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,911
Your head winemaker Francois...

174
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:53,180
he is a pro.
He's the key to the merlot's success.

175
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:56,518
The only question is, do you want
to go in the wine business?

176
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,921
I don't even know how to balance
a checkbook.

177
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,017
How am I supposed to
turn a winery around?

178
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,688
If you'd prefer, we could
put the chateau on the market.

179
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:07,028
But given the state of the debts,
you'd barely break even.

180
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,534
Okay.

181
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,559
The keys.

182
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,635
And the company credit cards.

183
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,144
I know this is a lot to digest.

184
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,078
Take some time to think it over.

185
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:24,339
I need to know by Monday.

186
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:29,415
- Did he say Monday?
- Today is Friday.

187
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,979
Okay.

188
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,026
Could you...?

189
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:38,155
Wait, I'm... I'm all over it.

190
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,195
Who the hell is that?

191
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,366
I have no idea.

192
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,675
Jennifer: Hey. Hey.

193
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,846
- Jennifer.
- I'm not gonna throw hard.

194
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,942
- (Wendy yelps)
- What the...?

195
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,850
What did you do that for?

196
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,548
You, out of the pool.

197
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:07,255
- What are you doing?
- I'll handle this.

198
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:10,091
I've dealt with vagrant freeloaders
all my life. You've met my brothers.

199
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,756
- Hi.
- Hi.

200
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,891
- I'm Wendy.
- And the ball thrower is?

201
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,164
Jennifer. What are you doing
in my friend's pool?

202
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,000
Your pool?

203
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,404
- Are you Jerry's daughter?
- Yes, she is.

204
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,840
Oh, great meeting you.

205
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,242
- I'm Romario.
- Of course you are.

206
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,576
I'm the assistant winemaker.

207
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,344
Your father invited me
to use the pool.

208
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:34,147
Must be nice to have a job
that lets you slack off all day.

209
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:35,778
Okay, don't listen to her.

210
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,982
You're more than welcome to use the pool
whenever you want.

211
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,820
That's very kind of you.

212
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,089
And you'll find out
we work really hard around here.

213
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:46,188
(speaking Portuguese)

214
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,233
- Really?
- Yeah.

215
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,238
Jen spent some time in Brazil
during college.

216
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,070
Ha. I'm from Sao Paulo.

217
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,700
How lovely for you.

218
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:01,907
Well, I'll get back
to my very hard work.

219
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:05,007
And I'll always be
at your service.

220
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,244
Thank you.

221
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,855
I need wine,

222
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,054
lots and lots of wine.

223
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,086
Food first.

224
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,826
- Let's restock that fridge.
- Yeah.

225
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:33,200
And you are?

226
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,873
Nathan Landry.

227
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,042
Wendy Rollins.

228
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,215
Ah, Jerry's daughter.

229
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,119
Yeah.

230
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,784
My condolences.

231
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,523
I own the winery down the road.

232
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:54,055
We were friendly competitors.

233
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:58,236
I was looking for Roy.

234
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,331
I thought I might make an offer
to buy the place,

235
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:06,071
now that Jerry has
ventured forth.

236
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:08,773
She really hasn't decided
what to do with it yet.

237
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,408
Oh, well, naturally.

238
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,180
Settle in.

239
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,280
Check out the books.
Give me a call.

240
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:21,020
I think you'll find
my price fair,

241
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,087
given the state of the winery.

242
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,634
Well, that was tacky.

243
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,466
Wendy:
Yeah, he's pretty bad, right?

244
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:35,908
I've been around enough dicks in my life
to know one when I see one.

245
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:41,836
Okay, why don't you deal
with the food?

246
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,644
I'm gonna go check out
the competition.

247
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,343
Why do I get stuck
with the food?

248
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,614
Because of my dad's
credit card.

249
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,416
Right.

250
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,514
Oh, Skittles.

251
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:06,697
Hey there.

252
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,275
Run.

253
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,104
Why are we hiding?

254
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:20,141
Because I don't want to go to jail
and get one of those prison showers.

255
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:22,847
I don't think they send you to prison
for breaking a bottle of wine.

256
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,981
Wendy: Anything's possible.

257
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,090
Wendy: Hmm.

258
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,186
You're kind of odd.

259
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,629
Oh, I'm odd? You're the one
who's been stalking me.

260
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,656
- Stalking you?
- Yeah.

261
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,260
And to be honest,
I don't really appreciate it.

262
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,567
Most of the women I stalk
are grateful.

263
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,573
Well, I'm not like most women.

264
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,575
You're not gonna get an argument
from me on that.

265
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,167
(chuckles)

266
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,475
Well, I never really got
to properly thank you for today,

267
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,277
so let me repay the favor.

268
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,977
I already have a tank of gas,
but thanks.

269
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,485
Not your gas, you moron.
Your groceries.

270
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,148
You want to buy
my bananas and...?

271
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,089
Wendy: Oh, condoms.

272
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,649
Are you teaching
a sex ed class later?

273
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,162
Look, I appreciate the offer,
but I don't think it's appropriate

274
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,664
for a woman I barely know
to pay for my prophylactics.

275
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,032
I have no idea what that means,
but I will take your word for it.

276
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:14,231
- What about dinner then?
- Weren't you just passing through?

277
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,265
I was, but I just inherited
a winery.

278
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,708
Really? Which one?

279
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,872
It's called the Chateau Meroux.
Have you ever heard of it?

280
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,245
Yeah, yeah,
I think I've heard of it.

281
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:26,877
Well, when you get hungry,

282
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,910
just give me a call.

283
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,751
I still don't know your name.

284
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,816
It's Wendy.

285
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:38,419
- Was that the guy from the...?
- Yep.

286
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,193
Were you actually
flirting with him?

287
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:44,134
I was. I broke a bottle of wine
and offered to buy him condoms.

288
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,727
Oh.

289
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,636
What's for dinner?

290
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,875
I don't know.

291
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,772
I'm offering you a lot of money,

292
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:00,216
Francois.

293
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:03,221
I don't make wine
that's served from a box.

294
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:05,689
I don't want you to.

295
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:09,717
But I'm about to buy
a premium winery

296
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,788
and I want a premium winemaker
to go with it.

297
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:15,095
What winery are you buying?

298
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,602
The Chateau Meroux, of course.

299
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,194
You're buying my winery?

300
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,502
It's not yours yet, my friend,

301
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,600
but it could be.

302
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:28,272
But what if it was?

303
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:31,805
Complete creative freedom.

304
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,576
The old vine Zin.

305
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:39,489
Oh, those grapes produce
three tons per acre.

306
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:42,050
I can replant with just about
anything else

307
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,755
and make 12.

308
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:49,793
And if you owned
an animal shelter,

309
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,826
you could bottle the piss.

310
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,360
(chuckles)

311
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,532
The old vine Zinfandel.

312
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,301
And if you want to bottle piss,

313
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:01,335
your son is the man for the job.

314
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,080
You're hiring the Chateau Meroux's
winemaker?

315
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,250
If I have to.

316
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:17,686
Well, you might want to know
that I met his new boss this afternoon.

317
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,562
- Wendy?
- Yeah.

318
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,000
How nice.

319
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:30,173
Ah, you're getting closer.

320
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,234
(rock song playing)

321
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,803
- Yum.
- Mm-hmm.

322
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,248
Here comes your man candy.

323
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,316
I'm so not interested
in a stupid farm hand.

324
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:47,018
Okay, a) don't be a snob;

325
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,050
b) this isn't a farm;

326
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,585
and c) that's what
farm hands are for.

327
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,962
He has a six-pack.
I don't trust him.

328
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,866
You threw something at him.
That's how I know you like him.

329
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,062
Hello, ladies.

330
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,503
Is there anything I can do
to help you?

331
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,500
Yeah, don't touch me.
Thanks.

332
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:07,068
So, what, you just went over there?

333
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:10,013
With Jerry Rollins dead,
we've got a good shot

334
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,845
at buying the place.

335
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,409
- Chris: Good grapes.
- Better than good.

336
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:18,082
I'm tired of boxed wines.

337
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:21,581
I deserve better.
We deserve better.

338
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,720
Now you want the Meroux?

339
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,753
I want the status

340
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:28,891
that comes with it.

341
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,424
Chris: Will she sell?

342
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,403
Nathan: I expect so.

343
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:35,565
She may need a little
friendly nudge.

344
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,131
No.

345
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,541
You want to start toying
with your little blends again?

346
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,571
Talk to her.

347
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,606
Get her to sell.

348
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,983
You'll get your little hottie back

349
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,114
and better grapes
to work with besides.

350
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,215
What about Francois?

351
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:57,420
I didn't hear him
agree to the offer.

352
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,521
Did you?

353
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:04,125
Hey, girls,
the grill is hot and ready.

354
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,194
That is so sweet of you, Romario.

355
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:07,796
Isn't that sweet of him?

356
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,171
He's a prince.
Thank you, Fabio.

357
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,268
(quietly) Don't you have
some grapes to pick?

358
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,176
As a token of our appreciation,

359
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,408
we would be honored
if you would stay for dinner.

360
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,473
"Honored" is overstating it
just a little.

361
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:22,613
Come on, why don't you show us
city girls how to heat up some meat?

362
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,645
Jen here will help you.

363
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:29,150
Oh, don't give me that look.
I could stand here all day.

364
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:33,927
(speaking Portuguese)

365
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,159
(cell phone rings)

366
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,670
Hello. This is Wendy.

367
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,039
Hey, it's Chris.

368
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,601
Oh, my stalker.
How's it going?

369
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,545
Well, I was getting
these sharp hunger pains

370
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,810
and I thought it might be a good time
to take you up on your offer.

371
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,841
Sure. We're actually having
a little barbecue.

372
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,045
We?

373
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,021
Yeah, Jen and Romario.

374
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,989
Why don't you come on by
and eat your face off?

375
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,651
You know where
the Meroux is, yeah?

376
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,024
I think I can find it.
I'll see you soon.

377
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,289
Okay.

378
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,092
Hey, boys,
I'm having a guy come over,

379
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:15,197
so I'm wondering if you could maybe
stop on by so it's not too awkward.

380
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,231
You want to help your boss out?

381
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,374
Free food.

382
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,251
How the hell are you supposed to know
when they're done?

383
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,811
Well, give me your hands.

384
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,846
Feel the skin here.

385
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,983
- This is rare.
- Mm-hmm.

386
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:37,018
- Here... medium.
- Mm-hmm.

387
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,121
And here is well done.

388
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,325
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

389
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,497
Hey, look at you,
grilling like a professional.

390
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,403
It's my business.

391
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,408
Man: Romario.

392
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,774
Excuse me, ladies.

393
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,403
Oh, yo, who the hell are they?

394
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,073
They're my workers.

395
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:59,106
It's hot out. They were thirsty.
So I invited them to join us.

396
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,517
We don't really have enough food
for all these people.

397
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:03,145
Just cut everything in half.

398
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,213
Oh, and Chris is coming.

399
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:09,489
Homeboy must really like you
if he's hightailing it over here.

400
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:12,361
What can I say?
I'm irresistible.

401
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,597
What are they whispering about?

402
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,438
Romario: I think they're all worried
about losing their jobs

403
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,444
now that you're here.

404
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:28,503
I would never do that.

405
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:32,244
Okay, 20 bucks to the guy
who could tell me the dirtiest joke.

406
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,013
Who's up first?

407
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,815
I'll take you up on that.

408
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,879
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

409
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:41,723
Um, stalker, this is everyone.

410
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,695
Everyone, this is my stalker.

411
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,459
- Hey, Stalker.
- Hey.

412
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,363
Looks like you guys
are having a good time.

413
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,891
Well, some of the guys... the workers,
they were hungry.

414
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:53,166
So I decided to invite them
to our mini-feast.

415
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,173
That's really nice.

416
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,107
We never did anything like that.

417
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,337
We?

418
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,711
Oh, well, my family
used to be in the wine business.

419
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:05,717
Well, I'll have to
pick your brain later.

420
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,413
All right, let's get you
some of this food, huh?

421
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:11,820
Fantastic. What started as hunger pains
are now full-on body spasms.

422
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,348
- Oh.
- This is it?

423
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,327
Wendy:
Okay, you know what?

424
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,090
I think food's overrated.

425
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,758
Booze... totally making a comeback.

426
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,429
It's a nice place.

427
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,937
Yeah, I grew up here.

428
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,667
Some of my favorite
memories of my family

429
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,265
are in these vineyards.

430
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:31,866
When my parents split up,

431
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,708
my dad and I really just didn't have
the best relationship.

432
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,976
I know a little bit
about that kind of situation.

433
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,018
I have to let them know on Monday
if I'm keeping the place,

434
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:43,282
and I just... I don't know
the first thing about wine.

435
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:45,721
Do you know how to drink it?

436
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,247
Right, right.

437
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,385
Well, that's a start.
The rest you learn as you go.

438
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,952
- Really?
- Yeah.

439
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:55,890
Take a sip.

440
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:00,866
The grapes are crushed into juice,
which turns into sugars.

441
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:04,899
And that sugar converts into alcohol.
Every one of these vines out here

442
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,843
turns out about eight
bottles of wine.

443
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:09,108
It can't be that easy.

444
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:11,138
Well, it's not,
but it's a start.

445
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:19,221
Wendy: Well, for a stalker,
you're pretty well-informed.

446
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:21,248
(Chris laughs)

447
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,488
I try.

448
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,189
Wendy: Sorry about dinner.

449
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,391
Let me make it up to you.

450
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:29,297
Yeah, sounds good.

451
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:30,631
How's tomorrow?

452
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:31,863
Great.

453
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,246
The dishes are done.

454
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,189
You didn't have to do that.

455
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,193
I ate your food, drank your wine.

456
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,092
I was happy to get my hands
a little wet.

457
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:59,255
(laughs) You know,
with lines like that

458
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:00,958
you should be writing
greeting cards.

459
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,991
Why don't you like me?

460
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:06,560
I don't know.
Maybe it's because you sound like

461
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,766
you just stepped out of
a bad romance novel.

462
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:10,741
And you don't like romance?

463
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,869
Sure, I like romance,
just not with men that wax their chests.

464
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:19,281
(speaking Portuguese)

465
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,249
Mm-hmm.

466
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,702
Oh, what the hell?

467
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,968
I just went to bed, like,
20 minutes ago.

468
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,339
Oh, did someone have
a little too much vino last night?

469
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,003
Yes.

470
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,306
Bite me.

471
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:49,074
Come on, I need to get down
to the winery

472
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:51,173
to see what's what if I'm going to
take this place on.

473
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,047
What does that have to do with me?

474
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:56,110
I need my trusty advisor to come with me
to make sure I'm not making a mistake.

475
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,151
You'll be fine.
I have complete faith in you.

476
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,497
You just lied
to your best friend.

477
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,559
- Go away.
- I'll meet you downstairs in 15.

478
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,594
(groans)

479
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:15,333
I hate you.

480
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:17,364
Wendy: I hate me, too.

481
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,815
- Wow.
- This is no joke.

482
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:34,214
- Hi, Fabio.
- Oh, hey.

483
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,420
- My friend has some questions for you.
- Yeah?

484
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:38,986
I don't really know anything
about the winemaking process.

485
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,396
Okay, well, why don't you let me
show you around?

486
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,991
- Great.
- Okay.

487
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:45,025
These are the barrels.

488
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,301
That's the bottling room.
That's the lab.

489
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,898
Francois: Take your hands
off the knobs...

490
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,409
Oh, and that's our
head winemaker Francois.

491
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,277
Well, let's not bother the man
if he's busy.

492
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:57,679
No, no, no, it's no bother.
Francois loves yelling.

493
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:59,707
Take your big hose
and pick it up, because...

494
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,242
Francois.

495
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,278
I mean it. I'm done.

496
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:06,654
Francois, this is Wendy.

497
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,318
Hi. Pleasure to meet you.

498
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,952
- You must be Jerry's daughter.
- I am.

499
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,555
- He was a very good man.
- Doesn't sound like my father.

500
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:16,192
Really? How well
did you know your father?

501
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,802
Uh, anyway, I'm here to learn.

502
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:24,331
Anyway, I don't have
that much time

503
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,537
to give lessons to amateurs.

504
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:28,671
Well, if I'm gonna be
taking this place over,

505
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:30,442
I need to know how things work.

506
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,575
What you need to understand
is the importance

507
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:35,085
of letting a professional
be alone

508
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,918
when he practices his art.

509
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,583
Maybe you need to understand

510
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:42,184
the importance
of the meaning of the word "boss."

511
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:48,463
In these vats
is the finest merlot.

512
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,435
I've won gold medals
five consecutive years.

513
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:54,097
You mean the wines have won?

514
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,107
They're one and the same.

515
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:57,904
- What's in here?
- Glorified grape juice.

516
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:00,308
- Is it ours?
- Unfortunately your father

517
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,473
sometimes had to press
other growers' grapes.

518
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,780
In this case the client was
as good as the grapes

519
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:08,945
and he didn't pay.

520
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:11,751
- (thud)
- Do not move the pallet.

521
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,815
I'm gonna ask you one more time

522
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,224
not to move the pallet.

523
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,161
He likes to yell.

524
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:21,654
This moves again and you will wish
you were under it.

525
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,531
It's a lot to take in.

526
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:25,399
Yeah.

527
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,769
So if I decide to keep this place,

528
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,706
I want you to be involved.

529
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:32,175
Obviously I'm great with people,

530
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,940
but I don't know the first thing
about marketing.

531
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,970
You want me to quit my job

532
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,313
and move out here
to run your marketing department?

533
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,012
Yeah, why not?

534
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:46,183
Well, for one thing,
it's completely irresponsible.

535
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:50,251
For another thing,
I have a job and a life in San Fran.

536
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:53,924
And you said yourself, you can
barely even balance your checkbook.

537
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:57,901
Boo on you for throwing my financial
ineptitude in my face.

538
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:01,463
And it's just a question.
You could say no.

539
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,768
Okay.

540
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:06,037
No.

541
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,772
(both chuckle)

542
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:10,576
All right, look,
maybe I can help out

543
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,845
on the weekends
like a consultant, you know.

544
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:15,318
I'll drive up here.
I have to go back to San Fran tonight,

545
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,913
but I'd be happy to come up
and help when I can.

546
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:20,390
No. Offer rescinded.

547
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,189
The offer was, like,
12 seconds ago.

548
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,423
Hey, you've got to act fast
on this stuff, honey.

549
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,761
Oh, thank you, Wendy,
for your very sound business advice.

550
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,699
Anytime.

551
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:32,168
So can I buy you a glass of wine

552
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,194
while I wallow in my missed
opportunity?

553
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,503
I wish, but I am having dinner
with Chris.

554
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,202
Oh, okay.

555
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:39,767
Well, enjoy.

556
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,836
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

557
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:47,912
(thud)

558
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,314
Are you kidding me?

559
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,024
Seriously?

560
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:02,965
It's good for stress.

561
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,764
You know, you should try it.

562
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,704
Right, only I'm not really stressed.

563
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,832
You're maybe more like repressed?

564
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,364
(chuckles)

565
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:12,967
When are you gonna give it up?

566
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:15,878
Oh, well, when I get what I want.

567
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:19,281
Right, well,
I'm leaving tonight, so...

568
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,114
No.

569
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,211
You shouldn't drive
while you're so tense.

570
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:25,415
- It's definitely not safe.
- Uh-huh.

571
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,515
Why not leave
when you're relaxed?

572
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:31,329
Wow.

573
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:37,130
(thuds)

574
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:48,438
(thumping)

575
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:49,639
(Jennifer moans)

576
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:54,316
Oh, come on.

577
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,683
Come on.

578
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:01,349
(thudding resumes)

579
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,397
(knocks)

580
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,332
Um... (chuckles)

581
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,308
You.

582
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,106
What, you've never seen
a girl in a dress before?

583
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,408
- Wow.
- Actually I found it in this dumpster.

584
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:25,314
Once I got all the mayonnaise
stains off, it's pretty hot, right?

585
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,942
You're not normal.

586
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:29,283
Yeah, not in the slightest.

587
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:33,521
So where are you taking me tonight?

588
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,287
Somewhere cheap and dirty

589
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:37,521
or expensive and downright filthy?

590
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,463
Is that a trick question?

591
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:43,160
Well, I just need to know
if I should bring my Mace in or not.

592
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,260
It's mint-scented.

593
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:48,898
Hopefully I won't have to
use it on you later.

594
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,238
- You'd better be a good boy.
- (laughs)

595
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,301
(quiet music playing)

596
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,347
Thank you.

597
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:04,378
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

598
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:12,520
Ooh, it's strong.

599
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:14,793
When wine has a lot of alcohol,
we say it's hot.

600
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:17,733
Well, it sure is hot, then.
I might be giving lap dances later.

601
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,862
You know, I knew I should have brought
more dollar bills.

602
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:22,031
Yeah, you really
messed that one up, huh?

603
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:25,531
So what do you do

604
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:27,544
when you're not lurking
around gas stations?

605
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:30,376
I'm in...
(clears throat)

606
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:32,815
Mergers and acquisitions.

607
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:36,377
We buy and sell companies, turn things
around and sell them for profit.

608
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,719
We're in the middle
of a big project right now.

609
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:42,089
It could be
a big promotion for me.

610
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,957
That's great.

611
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,986
Yeah, yeah.

612
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:49,932
Um, what do you say we order?

613
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,959
Ready whenever you are.

614
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,140
Mm-mmm.

615
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:03,877
You're really enjoying that.

616
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:06,850
This sauce is so good.

617
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:08,818
I could take a bath in it.

618
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,786
- Don't get any ideas.
- No, wouldn't dream of it.

619
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,815
Are you interested
in dessert tonight?

620
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,191
Normally I would say yes,
but I'm completely stuffed.

621
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,219
I'll just take the check.

622
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:20,958
Actually, it's already been
taken care of.

623
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,332
What? You might want to leave.
This could get ugly.

624
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,530
- Listen...
- No, don't you "listen" me.

625
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,402
I was supposed to be
taking you out to dinner.

626
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:30,669
Yes, I let you pick me up
and I shaved my legs

627
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:34,007
and got a bikini wax just in case,
but that does not negate the fact

628
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:36,411
that I was supposed to be
treating you.

629
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:41,383
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Dude, dude, dude,

630
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,444
you can't freak out
every time I yell at you.

631
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,479
Chris: Wendy, we can't do this
right now.

632
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,424
Wendy: We are definitely
not doing it later, I can tell you that.

633
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,518
What the hell are you doing
under the table?

634
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,461
- There's a woman. And she's...
- Your wife?

635
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:54,988
Your wife? I knew it.
I knew I couldn't trust you.

636
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,864
- How does it feel, huh?
- Wendy.

637
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,892
What?

638
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:01,200
Wendy, she's not my wife.

639
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:03,002
- She's not?
- No.

640
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,702
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
Are you bleeding?

641
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:06,733
A broken rib maybe.

642
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:10,179
Anyway, we dated a while back.
If she sees me with another woman,

643
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,341
she's gonna flip out.

644
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,907
- Where is she?
- That doesn't matter.

645
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:15,942
We just need to leave here
without being seen together.

646
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,921
Okay.

647
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:20,446
Wait, is she wearing
a red dress?

648
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,686
Um, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, sure, that's her.

649
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,955
Just meet me outside.

650
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,520
Okay, I'm on it.

651
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:30,123
Oh.

652
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,897
Thank you.

653
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:36,897
Hello, ma'am.
Excuse me, did you get the vodka tonic?

654
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:38,806
- The vodka tonic.
- All right.

655
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:41,744
- (gasps)
- Oh, no, I am so sorry.

656
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:53,256
I'm sorry about that.

657
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,588
Which part?

658
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:57,492
The part where you hid under the table
like a little girl

659
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:59,052
or when you hijacked
my thank-you?

660
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,258
Both.

661
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,267
How can I make it up to you?

662
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,326
You can't.
You're dead to me.

663
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:06,802
Come on.

664
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:09,102
Seriously, be a man for a second.

665
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,108
Why don't you pretend
like you've got a penis?

666
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,700
(chuckles)

667
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:14,734
Fine.

668
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,009
Give me a tour of your winery.

669
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:19,312
Right now? It's late.

670
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,875
Since when are you not up for
a little adventure?

671
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,890
This is quite the operation
you've got here.

672
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:30,325
Wendy: Yeah, it's not too shabby.

673
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:32,261
It's not doing so well, though.

674
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,821
Well, you're probably making
the wrong kind of wine.

675
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,028
What do you mean?

676
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,595
Well, I've had your wine.
It's good,

677
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,039
but it's expensive.
And that limits your options.

678
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:48,375
How many people want to buy
a $70 bottle of wine?

679
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:51,745
That's true.
I've normally only spent $10.

680
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:54,876
Yeah, plus your signature wine
is a merlot.

681
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,910
"Sideways" killed that market
years ago.

682
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,356
You should think about
branching out,

683
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:04,384
you know, come up
with some unique blends

684
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:06,225
that are less expensive.

685
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:09,290
So you're saying I could blend
our expensive wine

686
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,029
and put it together
with our cheaper wine?

687
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:13,832
Yeah.

688
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:15,930
I mean, if that's what you want.

689
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,841
So how would you market that?

690
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,914
The Oakvale competition's
coming up.

691
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:27,474
The winner gets a major
distribution contract.

692
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,043
Even the exposure itself
would bring up sales.

693
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,220
You know a lot about this stuff.

694
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:37,454
Yeah, a little bit.

695
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,397
It's too bad you're stuck
in mergers and acquisitions.

696
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:47,700
I'm kind of trapped
in my family business.

697
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:51,196
My father never understood
my passion for winemaking.

698
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:54,177
Well, I think you'd make
a great winemaker.

699
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,875
You know,

700
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,680
the more I learn,

701
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,846
the more I like this place.

702
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,220
Maybe I'll stay.

703
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,988
You know, it's late.

704
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:13,758
I'd better get going.

705
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:16,164
But in the interest of pretending
I have a penis,

706
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,134
I demand that you make me
dinner tomorrow night

707
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:19,659
- and it be ready by 7:00.
- Yes, sir.

708
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:21,501
And you'll be wearing
a French maid's uniform.

709
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,099
Okay, now you're pushing it.
Let me walk you out.

710
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,882
Really, Romario?

711
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,751
What's wrong with this picture?

712
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:40,814
Jennifer... she wore me out.

713
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:42,621
So I heard.

714
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,820
You did?

715
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:46,694
You see, big house
plus thin walls

716
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:49,393
equals lots of echoing.

717
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,593
I'm sorry.

718
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:53,331
I must tell you,

719
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:54,895
I really like her.

720
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,839
Is that so?

721
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:58,865
I'm surprised.

722
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:02,568
I think Jennifer will be as well.

723
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,104
- Good night.
- Good night.

724
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,651
Oh, you're here early.

725
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,092
I thought you were gonna call
when you were done with Wendy.

726
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,260
Well, it got kind of late.

727
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,100
- It wasn't like that.
- Uh-huh.

728
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,868
How did everything go?

729
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,632
Fine.

730
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,975
She's kind of odd,
but she opened up to me.

731
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:37,003
Uh-huh.

732
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:38,777
And?

733
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,841
She's starting to like the place.

734
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:44,048
Huh. Well, then...

735
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:51,690
We'll have to speed things up.

736
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,060
Argh!

737
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:54,758
Damn sciatica.

738
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,825
You're getting there.

739
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:01,201
- Right here.
- Okay. Great.

740
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:04,605
<i>- And alli.
- There.</i>

741
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:07,008
So is this the one
for the credit line?

742
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:10,844
Yes, we'll get it transferred
over to you real soon.

743
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,143
Super.

744
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,741
(cell phone rings)

745
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,017
Roy Hutchinson.

746
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:19,989
Roy, Nathan Landry.

747
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:24,051
Listen, I don't want to tell you
your job,

748
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,928
but don't you have
a professional responsibility

749
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:30,627
to tell your client she can't handle
the winery on her own?

750
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:33,000
Well, she's right here, Nathan.

751
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,062
Maybe you should tell her yourself.

752
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,131
Hello.

753
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:42,204
Miss Rollins,

754
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:46,615
how nice to talk to you again.

755
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,676
I just thought I'd catch you

756
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,622
before you did something foolish.

757
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:57,286
My offer on the Chateau Meroux
still stands,

758
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:00,695
but I will need to know today.

759
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,564
Well, that is very kind of you,

760
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:05,501
but...

761
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:07,834
I'm gonna keep the Chateau.

762
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,009
A bold decision.

763
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,509
I hope you know
what you're getting into.

764
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,875
Do I know what
I'm getting into?

765
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:28,317
We have to change
the game plan.

766
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:29,519
How so?

767
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,551
When are you seeing her again?

768
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,256
She's cooking me dinner tonight.

769
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:34,958
Perfect.

770
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,467
Just keep her busy.

771
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,594
Wait, what are you
planning to do?

772
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:43,505
Exactly what I have to do.

773
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:44,141
(cell phone rings)

774
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,371
(cell phone rings)

775
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,741
Hey, stranger.

776
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,336
Hey, how's it all going?

777
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,042
Well, I actually need you
to get your butt back here

778
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:54,744
because things are really heating up
with this whole wine madness.

779
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,252
I have a job.

780
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,118
Well, I'm gonna pay you.

781
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:00,783
It doesn't count when you pay
people in Twinkies.

782
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:02,486
I'll be back as soon as I can.

783
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:04,994
Okay, well, just remember
that I seriously need you

784
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:07,930
and you're gonna be plagued with guilt
until you get back here and help me out.

785
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,492
Is there anything else I can do for you
while I entirely uproot my life?

786
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:14,902
Oh, yes, can you get my yellow dress
and that cashmere sweater?

787
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:17,100
And then also by the door
I have these amazing

788
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,268
heels that...

789
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:23,746
No Twinkies for you.

790
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,912
I'm sorry I'm late.

791
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:35,653
I got held up
in a business thing.

792
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:37,661
Typical.

793
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:40,892
Well, you're gonna have to
sing for your supper now.

794
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:44,059
Well, I'm not the best vocalist.

795
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,001
I sound more like a dying dog.

796
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:49,164
Oh, okay.
Well, bark then.

797
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:50,468
Excuse me?

798
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,772
Just bark like the dog you are.

799
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,869
(chuckles)

800
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:57,005
I'm not barking for you.

801
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:59,038
Then you're not coming in.

802
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,881
Wait. Hey, hey, wait.
Wait a minute.

803
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:06,485
(barking)

804
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,949
That was pathetic.

805
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,661
(both chuckle)

806
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:25,038
You... you're gonna
get punished for that.

807
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:26,838
- I'm so not afraid of you.
- Oh, you should be.

808
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:41,548
(owl hooting)

809
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,665
(pop song playing)

810
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:00,908
(owl hooting)

811
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,615
- (quiet song playing)
- Mm.

812
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,991
That was surprisingly good.

813
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:26,053
Well, I guess we're even now.

814
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:28,121
Not if I do the dishes.

815
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:25,619
So if you're interested
in another home-cooked meal,

816
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:27,954
you're gonna have to clean
my whole house.

817
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:30,585
What does this give me?

818
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:32,060
A blueberry.

819
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:35,930
Wendy, there's been an accident.
Come, come quickly.

820
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:44,497
We've lost an entire tank.

821
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:46,839
That's half of our best wine.

822
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:48,708
Oh, my God, I can't believe this.

823
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,681
I checked the tanks yesterday
and they were fine.

824
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:54,206
All right, go get cleaned up.

825
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,276
I'm sorry.

826
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:02,618
Look, Wendy, I really am sorry.

827
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:04,786
Look, what do you say

828
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:06,762
we clean this place up, okay?

829
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:08,059
Okay.

830
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:23,436
(clears throat)

831
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,141
Is there a problem?

832
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:27,207
- Yeah, let me show you.
- Oh, okay.

833
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,510
But seriously, don't get me wet.

834
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:32,112
I see where this is going.
Don't get me wet.

835
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:34,317
No, I'm not.
I wouldn't do that.

836
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:36,417
Okay, good.
'Cause that's not...

837
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,291
- Stop.
- What?

838
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:40,728
- Don't get me wet.
- You walked into the spray.

839
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:42,527
No, don't get me wet.
Okay, give me that.

840
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:45,160
No, no. Look, just be careful
not to release the nozzle too quickly.

841
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:46,464
What, like that?

842
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:48,198
Oh, that's not funny.

843
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:49,466
What about like that?

844
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:51,531
Okay. Stop it.

845
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:56,034
# I want more #

846
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,378
# It's not easy #

847
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:02,078
# In your chain of love #

848
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:05,179
# Not easy #

849
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:08,089
# When you're all I think of #

850
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:13,461
# I want more. #

851
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:18,025
So what are you gonna do now?

852
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:20,059
I honestly have no idea.

853
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:24,096
I mean, I guess Francois is really
gonna have to produce for us.

854
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,868
You could always sell the place.

855
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:29,902
Oh, believe me, I thought about it,

856
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:32,973
but I've had enough defeat
for one lifetime.

857
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:36,815
You've got some serious
challenges here, Wendy.

858
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,515
I don't want to see
anything bad happen.

859
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:40,386
Nothing's gonna hurt me.

860
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:42,324
You're not gonna let
anything stop you.

861
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,452
No.

862
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:46,428
Good for you.

863
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:51,293
It's never boring
around you, is it?

864
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:53,667
Not if I can help it.

865
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:58,632
- Good night.
- Good night.

866
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,282
- Jennifer: Hey.
- Hey.

867
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:10,980
I told you I'd be back.

868
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:13,012
Oh. What happened

869
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,991
to the important job you just
couldn't pull yourself away from?

870
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:17,653
- I quit.
- Really?

871
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:19,389
- Yeah.
- Oh.

872
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:21,897
That crazy guilt trip thing you did
actually worked.

873
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:24,628
And, I mean, let's face it:
You need me something fierce.

874
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:26,659
Besides, what kind of friend
would I be

875
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:29,035
if I wasn't there for you
in your hour of need?

876
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:33,465
Okay, well,

877
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:36,911
in the interest
of full disclosure,

878
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:40,713
I should probably tell you
that our wine vats exploded tonight

879
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,878
and we lost about 50%
of our juice.

880
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:49,593
Come again?

881
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,452
(cell phone rings)

882
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:57,396
Nathan, why are you
calling me this late?

883
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:00,926
Francois, we need to talk.

884
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:03,565
I'm having a big problem right now.
It's not a good time.

885
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,632
I'm upping my offer:

886
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:06,973
Leave the Meroux

887
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:10,502
and I'll finance
your private label...

888
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:12,572
anything you like.

889
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,449
I want the old vine Zinfandel.

890
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:18,147
Whatever.

891
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:20,884
I need to know in 24 hours.

892
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,425
Half your stock?

893
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,460
Like as in 50%?

894
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:39,942
More like 60% or 70%.

895
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,945
You said half.

896
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:44,413
Well, that's, you know,
an expression

897
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:46,507
like "I've never really
done this before."

898
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,610
Wendy, this is a disaster.
How are you so calm right now?

899
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:53,282
Whoa, that's not a tequila shot.

900
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,450
Oh, my God.

901
00:49:57,227 --> 00:49:59,661
I quit my job.
I don't even have medical insurance.

902
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:02,529
How am I gonna be able to afford food?
How are you not freaking out right now?

903
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:05,626
Because I already freaked out and you're
making me freak out all over again.

904
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:08,365
- Jeez.
- Okay.

905
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:10,032
Okay, okay.

906
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:12,007
All right, so what do we do?

907
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:15,239
Okay, tomorrow morning we're gonna
start a whole new blend, okay?

908
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:18,270
We're gonna take the rest of what's left
of the expensive wine

909
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:20,977
and mix it with
the less expensive juice.

910
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,679
Do you have enough
to launch a new brand?

911
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:24,209
We'd better.

912
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:27,314
Francois and Romario are just
gonna have to really step it up.

913
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,984
How is the farm hand doing?

914
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,051
Apparently he really likes you.

915
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:32,288
Oh, no.

916
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:36,163
No, no, no, no, no.
It was only supposed to be physical.

917
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,258
Don't hurt his feelings, okay?

918
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:40,462
Yeah, I know.

919
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:43,337
I know. Hmm.

920
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:46,900
Okay, so tomorrow, 10:00 AM,
senior staff meeting.

921
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:48,308
I need you there.

922
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:49,607
Yes, boss.

923
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:52,046
I like the sound of that.

924
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:03,923
- Hey.
- Hey.

925
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,292
What took you so long?

926
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:09,992
What made you think
I was coming back at all, hmm?

927
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:11,933
Don't joke.

928
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:14,994
Every moment away from you
is like an eternity.

929
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:19,037
Maybe less talking for you.

930
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,101
Come here.

931
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:33,884
(sighs)

932
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:40,161
You know what?
I have a really busy day.

933
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:46,228
Sorry.

934
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,737
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Okay.

935
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:51,736
- We need to...
- (zips)

936
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:55,643
We need to turn this place around,
especially after last night's accident.

937
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:59,581
So we're gonna create
a less expensive blend.

938
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:02,050
Your father did not hire me
to make slop.

939
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:05,111
Of course not.
I'm not suggesting that you create slop,

940
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:08,022
but we need to enter
new markets.

941
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:11,084
I really don't care
about new markets.

942
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,926
And I don't really care
about your problems.

943
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:17,900
Well, you'd better start caring,
because as of today, I'm your new boss.

944
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:19,959
You are not my boss,

945
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:22,403
because I'm no longer
your winemaker.

946
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:27,503
Wendy: What just happened?

947
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:30,570
My dreams of owning a summer home
were just flushed down the toilet.

948
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:39,185
No. No.

949
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:40,985
We can do this.

950
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:43,549
We just need
to lock down the blend.

951
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:45,083
Right.

952
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:46,993
Jennifer, you're on marketing.

953
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:50,898
Romario, you go and do
whatever it is that you do.

954
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:54,700
And I've got one more favor
to call in.

955
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:56,228
Pull!

956
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:58,002
(gunshot)

957
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:01,676
- Shit.
- (cell phone rings)

958
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:03,201
- Pull!
- Now's not really a good time.

959
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:04,873
Wendy: 10 seconds.
I just want to tell you

960
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:07,475
we're launching a new wine
just like you suggested.

961
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,951
Jennifer is back.
We're full speed ahead.

962
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:11,248
- That's...
- Nathan: Pull!

963
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:13,381
- Congratulations.
- (gunshot)

964
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:16,915
Wendy: Yeah, the only teeny problem
is Francois just quit.

965
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,326
And I don't know anything
about blends.

966
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,624
Pull!

967
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:23,394
- (gunshot)
- Damn.

968
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:25,492
- Maybe I can help.
- Great.

969
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:28,003
Do you think you can come by
this afternoon?

970
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,063
I'll be there.

971
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:32,540
How's everything at Meroux?

972
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:34,976
You tampered with the vats,
didn't you?

973
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:36,273
Pull!

974
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:37,541
(gunshot)

975
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:41,039
Nathan: Damn.
I don't know what you mean,

976
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:43,314
but if I did,

977
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:46,982
it would be because
I have our best interests in mind.

978
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:50,025
Pull!

979
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:53,223
- (gunshot)
- She's launching a new wine.

980
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:56,060
Say what?

981
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:58,090
She's launching a new wine.

982
00:53:58,134 --> 00:54:00,398
(laughing) Really?

983
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:04,237
How's she gonna do that
without a winemaker?

984
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:09,271
This is business.

985
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:12,475
And in business
I leave nothing to chance.

986
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:15,245
I don't want to have
anything to do with this anymore.

987
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:17,276
It's wrong and you know it.

988
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,686
You've done
more than enough already.

989
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:23,716
Do that girl a favor.

990
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,126
Don't see her again.

991
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:29,222
When I own the Meroux,

992
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:32,133
I'll drop Francois

993
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:36,662
and you'll be
the head winemaker,

994
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:38,537
just as I promised.

995
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:41,373
(cocks gun) Pull!

996
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:43,174
(gunshot)

997
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:44,840
Chris: Ooh, almost.

998
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:47,317
God damn it.

999
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,260
How am I supposed to know
which one?

1000
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:07,293
We don't know exactly.

1001
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:10,864
It's trial and error and a little prayer
thrown in for a good measure.

1002
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:13,273
I don't have time
for trial and error.

1003
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:17,713
Okay, what do you say
we change things up a little?

1004
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:24,612
First, stop thinking.

1005
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:27,248
It's not about the grape.
It's not about the process.

1006
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:30,123
- It's about what you like.
- Okay.

1007
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,387
Smell.

1008
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:36,456
Now taste.

1009
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:42,997
(clears throat)
It's a little dry

1010
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:44,700
on the sides of my tongue.

1011
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:47,676
- Typical cabernet.
- Ugh.

1012
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,077
Now this.

1013
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:02,318
It's fruity.

1014
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,350
Is it fruity?

1015
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:06,453
That's your merlot,

1016
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:09,056
Chateau Meroux, 2006.

1017
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:11,567
<i>- Oui, oui.
- (both chuckle)</i>

1018
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:15,002
Okay, one more.

1019
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:25,342
Mm, I like this.

1020
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:28,249
It's... it's soft

1021
00:56:28,284 --> 00:56:30,218
yet kind of spicy.

1022
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:31,720
Is this mine?

1023
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:33,950
It's a Syrah, not yours.

1024
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:36,959
I wish it was.

1025
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:45,532
(phone rings)

1026
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:50,833
Adam, it's Landry here.

1027
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:53,399
I've done better.

1028
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:55,741
But compared to my neighbors,

1029
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:58,043
I'm doing well.

1030
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,174
What's that?

1031
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:02,844
You didn't hear what happened
over at the Meroux?

1032
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:08,050
Oh, they had a little accident.

1033
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:18,024
I like this one.

1034
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:24,439
- Compare with the next one.
- Okay.

1035
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:32,172
- This one is a little more Syrah.
- Yes. Now keep going.

1036
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:34,979
Now follow your instincts
until you find the one you like.

1037
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:37,009
Psst.

1038
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:39,817
It's her birthday next week.

1039
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:41,050
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1040
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:43,388
They're usually a disaster.

1041
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:46,054
Text me some gift ideas.
I'll see what I can do about dinner.

1042
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:48,495
Mm, you guys are the worst
whisperers in the world.

1043
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:51,432
I like this one.

1044
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:58,471
It's pretty good.

1045
00:57:58,508 --> 00:58:01,341
Let someone with a more
sophisticated palate be the judge.

1046
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:03,368
(sniffs) Hmm.

1047
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:07,174
(sniffs)

1048
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:09,549
(sucks in air)

1049
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:13,215
(all laugh)

1050
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:15,053
- So that's it?
- Almost.

1051
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:16,649
- Almost?
- A little secret...

1052
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:18,752
we strain it through egg whites
just to smooth it out.

1053
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:20,786
Sounds like a really
disgusting omelet.

1054
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,128
Trust me,
it's the finishing touch.

1055
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:33,199
How's the design coming?

1056
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:35,643
Why don't we just call it
Chateau Meroux Meritage?

1057
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:37,509
Huh-uh, we gotta rebrand.

1058
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:39,538
Apparently people see
the Chateau wine

1059
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:41,447
as this old-school
grandma wine.

1060
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:44,885
We want young, hip, trendy.
I get it. I just don't have it yet.

1061
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:46,980
- (phone beeps)
- Well, a girl can dream.

1062
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,014
(sighs)

1063
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:52,858
- How's Romario?
- He's been texting me all day.

1064
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:55,023
I mean, enough already.

1065
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:58,500
- Dirty texts?
- No, dirty texts I want.

1066
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:01,834
I get really stupid,
sappy love sonnets.

1067
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,862
(phone beeps)

1068
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:06,034
Just do me already.

1069
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:09,067
(sighs)

1070
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:12,478
What about a text abbreviation?

1071
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:13,812
For "do me"?

1072
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:16,011
No, no, no, for your wine... YN.

1073
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,542
Wine... YN.

1074
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:20,781
Oh, that's good.

1075
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:23,189
That's actually really good.

1076
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:26,923
YN... that's our new brand name.

1077
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:28,828
- (phone beeps)
- Love it.

1078
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:31,925
(sighs) Ugh.

1079
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:38,266
Romario, Romario.

1080
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:40,469
Uh, what is this?

1081
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:43,543
Shakespeare.

1082
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:47,210
I read books.

1083
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:51,448
Listen, what we did...

1084
00:59:51,487 --> 00:59:53,216
it was just physical.

1085
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,520
- But...
- Just physical. No, no, no.

1086
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:56,718
I can't do this.

1087
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:59,922
- But...
- I can't.

1088
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,767
What?

1089
01:00:05,635 --> 01:00:07,432
Wendy, this should just
take a second.

1090
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:10,598
I need you to sign
this amendment

1091
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,165
to the line of credit transfer
I filed.

1092
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:14,608
Amendment?

1093
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:16,976
Yeah, the bank found out
about the wine spill.

1094
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:19,345
- Oh.
- They want to do an asset check.

1095
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:21,873
Okay, this isn't gonna
mess anything up though, right?

1096
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:23,909
No, it shouldn't.

1097
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:25,250
Okay.

1098
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,620
It should all be settled
in a couple of days.

1099
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:31,286
You frighten me sometimes.

1100
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:33,352
I get that a lot.

1101
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:42,465
# Living the dream... #

1102
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:55,681
# Living the dream. #

1103
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:07,086
(cell phone rings)

1104
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:10,463
Hey.

1105
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,764
Wendy: Are you ready
for some madness tonight?

1106
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:14,827
We're just going to Shorty's,
not robbing a bank.

1107
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:16,998
You never know
where the night may lead.

1108
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,235
Well, that's true.
I'll see you in a bit.

1109
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:26,547
- Hey.
- Hey.

1110
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:28,914
Did you need something?

1111
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:33,786
Why don't we grab dinner later

1112
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:38,283
and go over what's going to happen
with the Meroux?

1113
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:42,696
Could we do it tomorrow?
I'm kind of beat.

1114
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:45,223
- Sure.
- Yeah.

1115
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:55,807
Oh, and, Chris,

1116
01:01:55,845 --> 01:01:58,609
I appreciate all you've done.

1117
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:02,007
I won't forget it.

1118
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:07,146
(starts engine)

1119
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:29,968
- (quiet music playing)
- (laughter)

1120
01:02:30,012 --> 01:02:32,537
You guys didn't have to
get me anything.

1121
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,209
Well, I thought
it would be apropos

1122
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,218
to open a bottle of YN
for your birthday.

1123
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,220
It's from all of us.

1124
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,347
Well, then to all of us.

1125
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:41,549
Happy birthday.

1126
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:43,752
Thank you.
Thanks for coming, guys.

1127
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:45,590
Did you get everything you wanted
for your birthday?

1128
01:02:45,628 --> 01:02:48,597
A new blend...
which is delicious...

1129
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:50,189
YN campaign

1130
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:52,201
and you.

1131
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:57,766
Wow, I think I just
threw up in my mouth.

1132
01:02:57,807 --> 01:02:59,968
Oh, why don't you just
leave them alone?

1133
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:01,567
At least they're in love.

1134
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:02,908
What's your problem?

1135
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:04,435
You are my problem.

1136
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,381
You know, I have feelings

1137
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:09,384
and they are broken.

1138
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:13,921
Jennifer: Okay.

1139
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:16,117
I can't believe I have to
keep explaining to him

1140
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,717
what friends with benefits are.

1141
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,057
Maybe one more time.

1142
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:20,858
Jennifer: Yeah, one more time.
Excuse me.

1143
01:03:20,897 --> 01:03:24,765
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

1144
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:26,996
Wow.

1145
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:29,095
Awkward.

1146
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:44,009
Isn't it lovely to see true love just
blossom right in front of our eyes?

1147
01:03:44,053 --> 01:03:45,543
More cake for us, right?

1148
01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:51,253
Is it the ex-girlfriend again?
Because I'm telling you,

1149
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:53,159
this time I'm not gonna be
as nice about it.

1150
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:02,565
Well, hello there, Wendy.

1151
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:03,765
Hello.

1152
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:06,036
How's everything at the Chateau?

1153
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:09,203
It's been a challenge.

1154
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:11,645
Oh, yeah, I tried to warn you.

1155
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,672
But we're gonna be okay.

1156
01:04:13,716 --> 01:04:17,584
My son tells me
you're launching a new wine.

1157
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:19,247
Who's your son?

1158
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:22,587
Oh, that one.

1159
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,951
He didn't tell you?

1160
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:28,395
Chris was quite eager
when I asked him

1161
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:30,991
to keep an eye on you.

1162
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:33,297
He's been a big help

1163
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:37,966
keeping me apprised
of all the goings on at the Chateau.

1164
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:40,498
But I must say,
launching a new wine...

1165
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:43,137
that will be difficult.

1166
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:45,170
It's not something
for an amateur.

1167
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:47,205
Stop, please.

1168
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,718
The farther you drive it
into the ground,

1169
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:51,686
the cheaper it will be
for me to buy it.

1170
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,315
I'm not gonna sit here
and listen to this.

1171
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:04,428
Hmm.

1172
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:06,731
- Wendy.
- No.

1173
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:08,760
- Wendy.
- Don't touch me.

1174
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:10,431
I trusted you.

1175
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:12,236
Look, I know and I'm sorry,
but my dad...

1176
01:05:12,275 --> 01:05:14,334
Please don't give me
that dad crap.

1177
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:15,901
Aren't you an adult?

1178
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:18,243
You lied to me.

1179
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:20,511
I didn't exactly lie to you.

1180
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:22,517
Spying on me?

1181
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:24,382
And what was that whole
romance thing?

1182
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:28,481
I mean, were you just trying
to get some ass on the side or...?

1183
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:30,549
- That's not true.
- Don't touch me.

1184
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:35,353
You wanted me to sell, right?

1185
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:38,367
I mean, that's why you
asked me out in the first place?

1186
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:44,798
When were you gonna
tell me the truth?

1187
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:48,435
It's complicated.

1188
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:51,037
Complicated? Okay.

1189
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:54,311
You know, that's something
that a little boy would say,

1190
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:56,944
not a grown man.

1191
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:59,011
Wendy.

1192
01:06:02,892 --> 01:06:04,917
(thunder rumbling)

1193
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:10,822
You'd better figure out
whose side you're on.

1194
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:19,500
# Every time fall comes around #

1195
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:22,102
# I picture #

1196
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:25,511
# The way we used to be #

1197
01:06:25,548 --> 01:06:28,949
# Before you lied #

1198
01:06:30,786 --> 01:06:34,916
# If forgetting you #

1199
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:39,917
# Really was that easy #

1200
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:44,359
# Why does falling in love #

1201
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:50,032
# Still seem so scary? #

1202
01:06:57,313 --> 01:06:59,178
(knocks)

1203
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:01,649
Please go away.

1204
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:04,346
Wendy, it's Roy Hutchinson.
We need to talk.

1205
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:06,753
Can we please do this tomorrow?

1206
01:07:07,757 --> 01:07:11,158
Wendy, this is serious.

1207
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:14,356
The bank has canceled
your line of credit.

1208
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:18,362
They've frozen everything.

1209
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:26,139
Who are you,
the harbinger of doom?

1210
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:29,570
With the loss of all that wine,

1211
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:32,581
they won't give you
any more money.

1212
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:37,407
We were so close.

1213
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:39,444
You've got to make a payment
to the bank,

1214
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:41,479
otherwise they're gonna
foreclose.

1215
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:46,927
The other option
is to sell to Nathan.

1216
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:53,499
I'm really, really sorry.

1217
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:04,837
(sighs)

1218
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:27,852
- Hey.
- Hi.

1219
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:29,387
What's all this?

1220
01:09:29,431 --> 01:09:30,921
Cards.

1221
01:09:30,966 --> 01:09:34,561
I guess my father kept them
after they were returned.

1222
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:37,162
Are you okay?

1223
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:39,333
No.

1224
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:44,841
I mean, I just started
to get to know him through all of this.

1225
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,007
Now it's gonna be taken away.

1226
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:49,176
You're not gonna lose the winery.

1227
01:09:49,218 --> 01:09:52,312
Yeah, I am.
Roy stopped by last night.

1228
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:55,016
Our line of credit
has been frozen

1229
01:09:55,057 --> 01:09:58,151
because we lost so much
of the wine stock.

1230
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:02,289
We have no money...

1231
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:03,992
literally.

1232
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:07,662
I'm gonna have to
let the workers go.

1233
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:11,935
Wendy, this isn't you.

1234
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:13,965
Of course it's me.

1235
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:17,035
Things get hard and I give up.

1236
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:19,172
No, the minute you walked
through that door,

1237
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,807
you had all sorts of garbage
thrown at you,

1238
01:10:20,849 --> 01:10:22,441
and you've made it work.

1239
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:24,349
There's always a way.

1240
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:27,715
You really believe that?

1241
01:10:27,756 --> 01:10:30,122
I wouldn't be sitting here
if I didn't.

1242
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:32,320
(sighs)

1243
01:10:37,032 --> 01:10:39,626
I really do love it here.

1244
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:42,660
So let's get you a cup of coffee,
maybe a shower,

1245
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:44,673
and we'll figure all of this out.

1246
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:46,197
All right.

1247
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,576
Wait.

1248
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:52,604
Let me see that.

1249
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:54,809
Winner of the Oakville
Premium Gold Medal.

1250
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:56,147
Yeah, so?

1251
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:58,278
The winner gets a contract
with a major distributor.

1252
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,345
That would be enough
to keep the bank at bay.

1253
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:02,914
And all we have to do
is win the gold medal.

1254
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:06,690
I didn't say it would be easy.

1255
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:09,493
# We probably shouldn't talk #

1256
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:11,999
# 'Cause talking leads to thinking #

1257
01:11:12,034 --> 01:11:14,025
# And eyes wide open #

1258
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:16,731
# Blank in the dark #

1259
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:20,268
# We probably shouldn't think #

1260
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:23,278
# 'Cause thinking leads
to questioning #

1261
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:27,942
# And circles you right back
to the start #

1262
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:31,943
# Everything used to make sense #

1263
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:36,788
# We're testing it
and all of our strength #

1264
01:11:36,825 --> 01:11:38,850
# Oh, no #

1265
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:42,091
# If we don't leave now #

1266
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:44,759
# We will fall #

1267
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,496
# We'll regret #

1268
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:49,868
# What we've done #

1269
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:55,275
# To ourselves. #

1270
01:12:26,308 --> 01:12:29,175
Announcer: Welcome to
the Oakvale wine competition.

1271
01:12:29,211 --> 01:12:33,170
Enjoy your day of tasting
the region's finest.

1272
01:12:34,249 --> 01:12:36,274
Come on.

1273
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:42,546
If they win the gold,
we'll never get the Meroux.

1274
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:45,219
You promised me those grapes.

1275
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:48,696
Don't worry, I've taken precautions.

1276
01:12:50,799 --> 01:12:52,790
Wendy: Tell me
we're gonna be okay.

1277
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:54,860
Jennifer: We're gonna be okay.

1278
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:56,928
Now make me believe it.

1279
01:12:56,972 --> 01:12:58,997
Do I look like a hypnotist?

1280
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:02,442
Announcer: Will entrants please
bring their wines to the judging booth?

1281
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:04,946
All wines to the judging booth.

1282
01:13:23,499 --> 01:13:26,991
- Thank you. Good luck.
- Thank you.

1283
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:30,266
So these are the judges
I have to impress?

1284
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:33,365
Yeah, the judges are
all major distributors.

1285
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:36,710
Okay, let's do it.

1286
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:38,235
All right.

1287
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,838
Hello.

1288
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:45,515
You're Jerry's daughter.

1289
01:13:45,554 --> 01:13:47,784
He was a good man.

1290
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:49,051
So I've heard.

1291
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:51,685
We are entering a blend
this year.

1292
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:53,627
He would be so proud.

1293
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:55,721
Thank you.

1294
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:57,755
Now we wait.

1295
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,825
And pray.

1296
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:15,947
Wait here.

1297
01:14:34,102 --> 01:14:36,366
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen,
the wine competition

1298
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:39,738
will begin in a few moments
at the main judges' tent.

1299
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:41,504
You have some balls,
showing up here.

1300
01:14:41,543 --> 01:14:42,601
I can't do this now.

1301
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:44,043
It's not enough
that you broke her heart?

1302
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:46,104
You have to destroy everything
she's worked so hard for, too?

1303
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:47,240
I don't have time for this.

1304
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:49,409
I'm seeing red, Chris.
When I see red, the claws come out.

1305
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:52,443
That's fine. Fine. Kill me later.
There's something I gotta do.

1306
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:57,290
- Hey, hey, hey.
- No, Wendy.

1307
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:58,793
- Give me the bottle, Chris.
- You don't understand.

1308
01:14:58,827 --> 01:14:59,987
- No, I do understand you.
- Stop.

1309
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:01,461
- What are you doing?
- Wendy.

1310
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:05,725
Look, serve a fresh bottle.

1311
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:07,792
You don't have much time.
Go. Go.

1312
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:12,133
Good luck.

1313
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:14,233
Give it to me.

1314
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:16,301
- Give it to me.
- What's going on?

1315
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:04,755
And the winner in the under-$10
white wine category is

1316
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:07,591
the Campus Oaks chardonnay.

1317
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:11,990
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1318
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:15,128
And in the under-$10

1319
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:17,536
red wine category:

1320
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:19,541
Bronze... Campus Oaks;

1321
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:26,709
silver... YN by Chateau Meroux;

1322
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:33,013
and gold...

1323
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:34,750
Rabbit's Leap.

1324
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:41,286
Gold is Rabbit's Leap.

1325
01:16:42,531 --> 01:16:45,227
- Congratulations.
- Nathan: Thank you. Thank you.

1326
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:47,292
Thank you.

1327
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:52,130
Today marks

1328
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:54,574
a new beginning
for the Landry family.

1329
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:57,579
Our family's legacy

1330
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:59,843
was built on honesty

1331
01:16:59,881 --> 01:17:03,078
and devotion to quality.

1332
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:09,220
Not a lot of old vine Zinfandel
at Rabbit's Leap, is there?

1333
01:17:09,257 --> 01:17:11,282
We all make sacrifices

1334
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:13,351
in order to get what we want.

1335
01:17:21,103 --> 01:17:23,128
You're right.

1336
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:26,164
Wow.

1337
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:28,540
Our tradition of excellence

1338
01:17:28,577 --> 01:17:32,411
has been handed down
from generation to generation.

1339
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:35,041
- Hold it. Hold it. Just stop.
- What?

1340
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:37,847
Rabbit's Leap can't win
a serious contest.

1341
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:40,480
All they make is boxed wine.
He cheated.

1342
01:17:40,522 --> 01:17:42,012
What? That's ridiculous.

1343
01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:44,457
He put one of his labels
on an expensive bottle.

1344
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:46,984
This is completely inappropriate.

1345
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,662
If Rabbit's Leap won fairly,

1346
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:54,465
then any of their bottles should taste
just as good as the one the judges got.

1347
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:55,993
Of course.

1348
01:17:56,038 --> 01:17:58,598
Chris: Choose another bottle
from his tent.

1349
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,438
- Tell me if it's the same wine.
- This is outrageous.

1350
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:03,137
Choose another bottle.

1351
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:12,410
Pick one.

1352
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:39,272
There has been a mistake.

1353
01:18:39,314 --> 01:18:42,112
The real winner is

1354
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:45,449
YN by Chateau Meroux.

1355
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:47,955
(cheering)

1356
01:18:57,766 --> 01:18:59,961
Your distribution contract.

1357
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:01,229
Wow.

1358
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:03,100
You know, we're actually
gonna be launching

1359
01:19:03,138 --> 01:19:05,106
a whole new line
with the Meroux's grapes.

1360
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:07,370
When you have a moment later,
young lady,

1361
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:10,071
come back to the booth
and we'll talk.

1362
01:19:10,112 --> 01:19:12,273
Great.

1363
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:14,748
You did it.
You saved the Chateau.

1364
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:18,184
Hey, you know we all did it...
you, Romario.

1365
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:20,381
Yeah, Romario.

1366
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,583
He's turned into a complete chick.

1367
01:19:22,624 --> 01:19:24,353
Oh, poor you.

1368
01:19:24,392 --> 01:19:25,586
Hey, it's not funny.

1369
01:19:25,627 --> 01:19:27,595
When did I suddenly become
the man in my relationship?

1370
01:19:27,629 --> 01:19:30,496
Maybe when you started
objectifying him.

1371
01:19:30,532 --> 01:19:33,126
That was so not nice.

1372
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:34,795
Will you just go talk to him?

1373
01:19:34,836 --> 01:19:36,963
- Do I have to?
- Yes. Move it.

1374
01:19:37,005 --> 01:19:39,735
(exhales)

1375
01:19:50,185 --> 01:19:52,710
I can't believe
you threw everything away

1376
01:19:52,754 --> 01:19:55,348
for some woman.

1377
01:19:59,027 --> 01:20:01,052
She's not just some woman.

1378
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:05,625
Consider yourself fired.

1379
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:08,932
No son of mine
betrays his own family.

1380
01:20:11,773 --> 01:20:14,298
Goodbye, Christopher.

1381
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:41,495
Romario, hey.

1382
01:20:41,536 --> 01:20:45,097
Listen...

1383
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:47,631
I've been listening
and you say the same...

1384
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,667
Don't. Don't say anything.

1385
01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:52,271
- Don't say anything.
- Okay.

1386
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:57,216
I've been treating you the way
that men have always treated me.

1387
01:20:57,252 --> 01:20:59,686
And the truth is

1388
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:02,087
I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

1389
01:21:02,123 --> 01:21:03,715
Are you sure?

1390
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:05,749
Yeah, I'm sure.

1391
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:08,519
I'm sorry.

1392
01:21:08,563 --> 01:21:12,522
I'm hoping that we can
put this all behind us and move on.

1393
01:21:14,202 --> 01:21:16,170
Say please.

1394
01:21:18,306 --> 01:21:19,830
<i>Por favor.</i>

1395
01:21:21,443 --> 01:21:23,434
All right.

1396
01:21:31,786 --> 01:21:34,949
# I will adore you #

1397
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:38,721
# When you are old #

1398
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:42,196
# I'll always be your blanket #

1399
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:45,393
# When you get cold #

1400
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:48,891
# I'd walk through fire for you #

1401
01:21:48,937 --> 01:21:51,997
# Even if it hurt #

1402
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:54,941
# 'Cause if food was
all there was to feed my soul... #

1403
01:21:54,976 --> 01:21:57,376
I thought I might find you here.

1404
01:21:57,412 --> 01:22:00,575
# You'd be my favorite dessert. #

1405
01:22:04,052 --> 01:22:06,111
There's no excuse
for what I did.

1406
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:11,551
It was horrible, despicable.

1407
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:14,061
Don't forget cowardly.

1408
01:22:16,865 --> 01:22:19,129
I really screwed up.

1409
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:24,735
Sorry about your dad.

1410
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,333
That couldn't have been easy.

1411
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:29,843
It was the right thing to do.

1412
01:22:29,878 --> 01:22:32,039
That made it a bit easier.

1413
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:38,681
I spent so many years

1414
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,120
just being angry at my father.

1415
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:48,821
I don't want to be angry anymore.

1416
01:22:57,172 --> 01:22:59,163
It sure is beautiful.

1417
01:22:59,207 --> 01:23:02,608
I'm gonna miss coming out here.

1418
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:04,737
Well, if there's one thing
I've learned,

1419
01:23:04,779 --> 01:23:06,804
it's never too late
to start over.

1420
01:23:08,016 --> 01:23:11,474
You don't happen to have
an indentured servitude program, do you?

1421
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:15,080
We're actually looking for
a new winemaker.

1422
01:23:15,123 --> 01:23:19,526
Why? Are you looking
to work off your debt?

1423
01:23:19,561 --> 01:23:22,291
It depends on how long
that will take.

1424
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:24,924
It's gonna take a long time...

1425
01:23:24,966 --> 01:23:27,400
a really long time.

1426
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:30,834
You might have to get
a little dirty.

1427
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,536
(chuckles)
I think I can handle that.

1428
01:23:34,576 --> 01:23:37,010
# You are my favorite dessert #

1429
01:23:37,045 --> 01:23:41,414
# How I adore you #

1430
01:23:41,449 --> 01:23:45,553
# You are my favorite dessert. #

1431
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,745
Chris: It's never boring
around you, is it?

1432
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:49,814
Wendy: Not if I can help it.

1433
01:24:02,237 --> 01:24:04,228
# I would love to be #

1434
01:24:04,272 --> 01:24:07,469
# The one you lean on #

1435
01:24:07,509 --> 01:24:09,875
# I would love to wear #

1436
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:12,209
# Your ring #

1437
01:24:12,247 --> 01:24:14,215
# You're the thing I need #

1438
01:24:14,249 --> 01:24:16,342
# You're the food that feeds me #

1439
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:18,375
# I need you #

1440
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:23,380
# More than anything #

1441
01:24:23,425 --> 01:24:25,416
# I would love to share #

1442
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:28,827
# Your world #

1443
01:24:28,863 --> 01:24:30,854
# Can I offer you #

1444
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:33,766
# The moon? #

1445
01:24:33,802 --> 01:24:38,865
# Are you ready to be loved #

1446
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:44,607
# Morning, night and afternoon? #

1447
01:24:45,613 --> 01:24:48,377
# There's only one thing
left tonight #

1448
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:50,646
# To satisfy this girl #

1449
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:54,553
# Walk beside me, follow, guide me,
get inside me #

1450
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:59,219
# I want to share your world #

1451
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:03,295
# I want to share your world #

1452
01:25:03,331 --> 01:25:05,629
# I want to share
your world. #

1453
01:25:19,914 --> 01:25:22,041
Are we gonna get "Action!"
Or are we supposed to just go?

1454
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:24,017
- I think we just go.
- We just go. Okay.

1455
01:25:24,052 --> 01:25:26,145
- Yeah.
- Okay, copy that.

1456
01:25:26,187 --> 01:25:27,586
All right.

1457
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:30,751
Is it way windier than ever
right now?

1458
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:32,817
It feels way windier.

1459
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:35,193
I'm eating hair.

1460
01:25:36,998 --> 01:25:38,260
Oh, my Lord.

1461
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:41,166
All right. And action!

1462
01:25:41,202 --> 01:25:42,999
Yeah, sorry, guys.

1463
01:25:43,037 --> 01:25:46,302
- I guess we forgot to do that.
- We're really smart.

1464
01:25:46,341 --> 01:25:48,172
(both laughing)

1465
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:50,973
That was a good rehearsal.

1466
01:25:51,012 --> 01:25:54,038
Well, honestly, I just need to know
if I should bring my Mace in or not.

1467
01:25:54,082 --> 01:25:56,107
Yeah, it's mint-scented.

1468
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:58,642
The guy before you...

1469
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:02,645
- (laughing)
- Whoa.

1470
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:05,716
I have something really funny to say,
but it's not appropriate.

1471
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,785
It's not appropriate.
Okay, sorry.

1472
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:11,856
So where are you taking me tonight?

1473
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:13,925
Somewhere cheap and dirty

1474
01:26:13,968 --> 01:26:16,436
or expensive and downright filthy?

1475
01:26:16,471 --> 01:26:19,031
- (yelps)
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

1476
01:26:19,073 --> 01:26:21,268
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

1477
01:26:21,309 --> 01:26:23,869
What happened? What happened?

1478
01:26:23,912 --> 01:26:25,846
I think that just came off...

1479
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:27,848
the camera just almost
came off the mount.

1480
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:31,341
Oh, dear Lord.

1481
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:37,590
Oh, the boat and the wine.

1482
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:39,650
Ooh.

1483
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:41,355
Man: And action!

1484
01:26:42,363 --> 01:26:45,093
Man over radio: Radio check.

1485
01:26:45,133 --> 01:26:46,725
10-4, baby.

1486
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:48,395
Copy that.

1487
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:52,673
Man over radio: Wait for this red light,
then go.

1488
01:26:52,707 --> 01:26:54,971
I think it's gonna turn green.

1489
01:26:55,009 --> 01:26:57,307
I'm gonna keep going.

1490
01:26:57,345 --> 01:26:58,812
See this? Watch.

1491
01:26:58,846 --> 01:27:01,371
Blink blink blink. Bitches.

1492
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:02,644
Man: Okay, and...

1493
01:27:02,684 --> 01:27:05,244
All right, dig on in.

1494
01:27:05,286 --> 01:27:07,447
Ooh, I think I'll have an olive.

1495
01:27:07,488 --> 01:27:08,648
That seems safe.

1496
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:10,351
Oh, okay.

1497
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:12,518
Man over radio: When you go,
"Not up for a little adventure?"

1498
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,551
Just kind of share
a little bit of a look.

1499
01:27:14,596 --> 01:27:15,893
I can't tell from back here.

1500
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:17,795
Oh, dude, dude, we're on it.

1501
01:27:17,832 --> 01:27:21,324
- I mean, it's (bleep) amazing.
- We're rocking the (bleep) out of it.

1502
01:27:21,369 --> 01:27:23,269
You look great.

1503
01:27:23,304 --> 01:27:24,828
(laughs, spits)

1504
01:27:24,872 --> 01:27:27,170
- (bleep)
- (laughing)

1505
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:30,507
- (bleep).
- I couldn't swallow.

1506
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:32,536
Man over radio: We'll go again.

1507
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:34,571
And on the, "Now it's late," just...

1508
01:27:34,616 --> 01:27:36,709
I have nothing to say.

1509
01:27:36,751 --> 01:27:38,742
(both laugh)

1510
01:27:38,786 --> 01:27:40,913
You did.
You had something to say.

1511
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:45,659
Hey, listen, after this
I'll take you out to...

1512
01:27:45,693 --> 01:27:47,684
I'll take you to the KFC
and the A& W.

1513
01:27:47,729 --> 01:27:49,720
(southern accent)
Can I get a root beer?

1514
01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:02,100
- Man: What are you doing?
- (crew laughing)

1515
01:28:10,818 --> 01:28:13,218
Sorry. Move along.

1516
01:28:13,254 --> 01:28:15,654
I still don't know your name.

1517
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:17,521
It's Wendy.

1518
01:28:24,265 --> 01:28:26,631
I still don't know your name.

1519
01:28:26,668 --> 01:28:28,659
It's Wendy.

1520
01:28:31,239 --> 01:28:34,265
It's Wendy. It's Wendy.

1521
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:35,503
Mark.

1522
01:28:37,245 --> 01:28:39,270
Man: Action!

1523
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:41,077
(laughing)

1524
01:28:42,083 --> 01:28:43,380
Man: Action!

1525
01:28:47,088 --> 01:28:49,181
- Oh.
- Amanda: That was close.

1526
01:28:49,223 --> 01:28:51,487
Man: Action!

1527
01:28:51,526 --> 01:28:53,585
(man laughs)

1528
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:56,722
- That ball was thrown (bleep) hard.
- Amanda: I didn't throw that one.

1529
01:28:56,764 --> 01:29:00,894
I did not throw that one.
I promise. That was so not me.

1530
01:29:08,743 --> 01:29:10,677
Oh. What the...?

1531
01:29:10,712 --> 01:29:12,543
What did you do that for?

1532
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:14,104
Amanda: You, out of the pool.

1533
01:29:14,148 --> 01:29:16,048
(laughing)

1534
01:29:16,084 --> 01:29:18,075
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1535
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:20,110
Amanda: Oh, no. Oh, no.

1536
01:29:21,489 --> 01:29:23,116
Man: And action!

1537
01:29:28,463 --> 01:29:29,725
(crew laughing)

1538
01:29:32,467 --> 01:29:33,627
I don't know.

1539
01:29:33,668 --> 01:29:36,535
Ooh. Argh. Friend.

1540
01:29:36,571 --> 01:29:38,562
(bleep)

1541
01:29:43,544 --> 01:29:45,136
Dad.

1542
01:29:46,147 --> 01:29:48,172
Man: Action!

1543
01:29:52,653 --> 01:29:55,019
(crew laughing)

1544
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:57,786
You guys are funny.

1545
01:29:57,825 --> 01:30:00,123
Man: Moving on. Moving on.

1546
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:04,922
(jazz music playing)

1547
01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:40,851
(pop song playing)

1548
01:31:45,533 --> 01:31:48,730
# I will adore you #

1549
01:31:48,769 --> 01:31:52,830
# When you are old #

1550
01:31:52,874 --> 01:31:56,674
# I'll always be your blanket #

1551
01:31:56,711 --> 01:31:59,976
# When you get cold #

1552
01:32:00,014 --> 01:32:03,074
# I'd walk through fire for you #

1553
01:32:03,117 --> 01:32:05,847
# Even if it hurt #

1554
01:32:05,887 --> 01:32:08,981
# 'Cause if food was all there was #

1555
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:11,321
# To feed my soul #

1556
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:15,022
# You'd be my favorite dessert #

1557
01:32:21,168 --> 01:32:24,626
# I will wait for you #

1558
01:32:24,672 --> 01:32:28,005
# If I die first #

1559
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:31,773
# I'll always be the water #

1560
01:32:31,812 --> 01:32:35,179
# To quench your thirst #

1561
01:32:35,216 --> 01:32:37,207
# If you were drowning #

1562
01:32:37,251 --> 01:32:39,242
# I'd jump after you #

1563
01:32:39,287 --> 01:32:41,278
# Head first #

1564
01:32:41,322 --> 01:32:44,291
# 'Cause if food was all there was #

1565
01:32:44,325 --> 01:32:46,725
# To feed my soul #

1566
01:32:46,761 --> 01:32:50,060
# You'd be my favorite dessert #

1567
01:32:55,436 --> 01:32:59,372
# I'll always #

1568
01:32:59,407 --> 01:33:02,103
# Remember #

1569
01:33:02,143 --> 01:33:04,043
# Who you are #

1570
01:33:04,078 --> 01:33:09,243
# And how this feels #

1571
01:33:09,283 --> 01:33:12,980
# 'Cause I memorized your soul #

1572
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:19,789
# And if I put you in a bowl #

1573
01:33:19,827 --> 01:33:24,628
# You'd be my favorite dessert #

1574
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:34,098
