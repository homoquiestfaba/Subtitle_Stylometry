1
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:37,297
Good morning, Constable.

2
00:04:42,059 --> 00:04:43,617
Well done, Steed.

3
00:04:43,739 --> 00:04:44,967
My pleasure.

4
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:49,298
But the nuns were a surprise.

5
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:50,573
We try.

6
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:58,378
You never can tell--

7
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:00,296
When the enemy will strike.

8
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:02,370
If we still have an enemy.

9
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:06,214
There's always an enemy, Steed.
You just have to know where to look.

10
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:10,055
Something's up at The Ministry.
They want you to meet somebody.

11
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:12,249
Well, they know where to find me.

12
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:14,567
Macaroons...

13
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:16,773
...for Mother.

14
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:36,136
Good morning, Prime Minister.

15
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:38,138
Yes, Prime Minister.

16
00:05:39,299 --> 00:05:41,859
The Prospero Program weather shield
is down.

17
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:44,447
Yes, all of it.

18
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:46,218
The entire grid.

19
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:50,338
Yes, it's bad.

20
00:05:52,179 --> 00:05:53,294
Right away.

21
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,614
Dr. Peel?

22
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:30,015
"Please answer the telephone."

23
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:39,651
Good morning, Dr. Peel.
We've scheduled an appointment for you.

24
00:06:39,739 --> 00:06:43,527
John Steed. Boodle's Gentlemen's Club.
One hour. Thank you.

25
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:02,738
May I help you, madam?

26
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,128
For Mr. John Steed, I'm Dr. Peel.

27
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,851
I'm afraid that's impossible.

28
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:08,770
-You are female.
-As you see.

29
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:10,897
Then you can't come in.

30
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:12,817
I have an appointment.

31
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:15,254
No women.

32
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:18,252
-Not in Boodle's. Not since 1762.
-Really?

33
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:33,211
Dr. Peel, I presume.

34
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:36,616
And you must be Steed.

35
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:39,976
-Please don't get up.
-And I was about to throw in the towel.

36
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,538
Spot of bother at the door.

37
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:44,929
Well, I shouldn't wonder.
Not a woman inside Boodle's since--

38
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:46,134
1762.

39
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:50,016
So what was all this? Some sort of test?

40
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:53,455
Congratulations. You've entered
a bastion of male privilege.

41
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,650
You're not someone
who plays by the rules.

42
00:07:55,739 --> 00:07:57,570
Rules are made to be broken.

43
00:07:58,539 --> 00:07:59,608
Not by me.

44
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:04,330
Play by the rules, Doctor,
or the game is nothing.

45
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:06,337
And just what is the game?

46
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:09,371
This is all terribly formal.
Must I go on calling you Dr. Peel?

47
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:10,414
No, no.

48
00:08:10,499 --> 00:08:13,571
Under the circumstances,
you may call me Mrs. Peel.

49
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:14,888
Much better.

50
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:16,890
Now that we've settled
the matter of titles...

51
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,288
...will you kindly explain
why you wished to meet me?

52
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,176
I didn't. Mother did.

53
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:22,854
"Mother?"

54
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:24,208
Mother.

55
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:27,930
Four o'clock. Mustn't be late.

56
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:28,929
Time for tea?

57
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:32,409
Word of warning: Don't take
the macaroon. Mother's favorite.

58
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:47,733
You are now entering a restricted area.

59
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:57,576
I always prefer a room with a view,
don't you? Tea?

60
00:08:57,819 --> 00:08:59,810
I know about the Prospero incident.

61
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:01,378
Sugar, one lump.

62
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:04,371
-Is that why I'm here?
-You're here for tea, Mrs. Peel.

63
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:06,927
Welcome to The Ministry. Macaroon?

64
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:19,417
Prospero. Prospero.
Shakespeare's magician.

65
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,174
Do explain.

66
00:09:21,619 --> 00:09:23,098
Top-secret research.

67
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:26,854
A government project I was working on
to create a weather shield.

68
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:28,652
A defensive umbrella.

69
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:30,414
I get it.

70
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:32,849
Someone attacks, we put up this...

71
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:34,974
...umbrella...

72
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:37,527
...everyone goes home for tea. Marvelous.

73
00:09:37,979 --> 00:09:40,493
Until someone blows up the research lab.

74
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:42,688
But did they just walk in?

75
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:45,498
-How did they get past security?
-That's what's interesting.

76
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:49,128
Security cameras at the Prospero lab
picked up a picture during the attack.

77
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:51,608
Something I'd like you to see,
if you have a moment.

78
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:52,768
After tea.

79
00:09:53,819 --> 00:09:54,888
Of course.

80
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:09,169
Well, she looks terribly familiar.

81
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:13,811
You're our chief suspect.

82
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:19,777
I'm innocent, of course.

83
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:22,129
Or guilty until proven innocent.

84
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,417
-Why would I sabotage my own project?
-You tell us.

85
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:28,773
Looks like me.

86
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:32,733
But it isn't.

87
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:38,096
You will be allowed the privilege
to prove your innocence.

88
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:41,490
If you didn't blow up Prospero,
find out who did.

89
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:44,447
Mother would like me
to show you the ropes.

90
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:46,935
He'd like us to work as a team.

91
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:50,176
You mean I have to trust you?

92
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:52,217
Absolutely, Mrs. Peel.

93
00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:55,974
Shall we?

94
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:10,329
Do you think Mrs. Peel is dangerous,
Father?

95
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,410
All in my report, Mother.

96
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:14,457
Why haven't I read it?

97
00:11:14,619 --> 00:11:16,689
Because I haven't given it to you.

98
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:19,978
My theory goes: Mrs. Peel may be ill.

99
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:21,488
Amnesia?

100
00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:23,132
Possibly a split personality.

101
00:11:23,219 --> 00:11:25,858
Maybe trauma. There was a husband.
Test pilot.

102
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:28,290
Missing over the Amazon. Presumed dead.

103
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:29,732
He was one of ours.

104
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:31,616
Revenge is a possible motive.

105
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:33,769
She certainly fits our profile.

106
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:38,329
-How could you have released her?
-Mrs. Peel is our only lead.

107
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,767
Either she'll lead us to the real enemy...

108
00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:43,577
...or they'll find her.

109
00:11:51,499 --> 00:11:54,536
We were bombarding protons and ions
to make antimatter.

110
00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:58,812
I shall have to start calling you
"Doctor" again.

111
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:04,207
Artificially creating new weather systems.

112
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:11,013
You're a lady of hidden talents, Mrs. Peel.

113
00:12:20,099 --> 00:12:22,408
A little more flexibility in the wrist.

114
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:30,568
Scientist...

115
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,013
...swordsman.

116
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:38,058
To what do you attribute
your overachievements?

117
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:42,173
-My father always wanted a boy.
-Oh, really?

118
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,018
I fail to see the connection.

119
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,374
I had a feeling you would. So did he.

120
00:13:00,219 --> 00:13:01,174
Touché.

121
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:06,697
The ebony handles are a touch heavy,
Trubshaw.

122
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,849
I'll stick to the rosewood.

123
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:12,093
Excellent, sir. If you'd step this way....

124
00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:17,414
Now my knight has chosen his armor.
Shouldn't we be on our way?

125
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:20,134
Well, Trubshaw's a man worth meeting.

126
00:13:20,219 --> 00:13:22,016
No point in setting out half-shod.

127
00:13:22,099 --> 00:13:24,932
That's why I ordered you a pair
of boots, Mrs. Peel.

128
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:26,088
Thank you.

129
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:29,418
I hope your shoes and waistcoat
please you, sir.

130
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:31,412
-Impeccable.
-Quite.

131
00:13:31,739 --> 00:13:34,537
Your items will be delivered
to the usual address.

132
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:36,938
Mrs. Peel's boots?

133
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,011
-Send them on.
-Of course.

134
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:44,375
Mother suggested we go for a spin.

135
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,848
-Do you always listen to Mother?
-That depends.

136
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:49,453
Marvelous weather.
Not the sort of day to be stuck in town.

137
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:51,450
-I think we ought to get away.
-"We?"

138
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,858
Yes, just the two of us.

139
00:13:52,939 --> 00:13:55,772
A weekend in the country,
long walks, the wind in your hair.

140
00:13:55,859 --> 00:13:58,054
-How about it?
-Depends what you have in mind.

141
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,528
I'm a nature lover,
so whatever comes naturally.

142
00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:02,177
Should we take my car?

143
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:14,614
That's odd.

144
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:16,618
Rusty, perhaps?

145
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:19,410
I hope I haven't lost the knack.

146
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:33,327
Is the pot warm?

147
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:34,408
Always.

148
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:37,649
-Milk?
-Lemon, just a twist.

149
00:14:38,619 --> 00:14:41,213
No cakes, I'm afraid.
You don't mind roughing it, do you?

150
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:42,527
On the contrary.

151
00:14:42,619 --> 00:14:45,292
-Should we be making plans for tonight?
-We are.

152
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:49,088
I thought we'd have time to pay a
social visit, since we happen to be passing.

153
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,498
I thought as much.

154
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:53,139
-Anyone in particular?
-Sir August de Wynter.

155
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,489
Former Ministry man,
head of Special Projects.

156
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:58,776
Ran our Strategic Deception lnitiative.
He's retired now.

157
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:00,208
Very rich.

158
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:01,528
Very odd.

159
00:15:01,619 --> 00:15:02,734
Intriguing.

160
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:05,532
-A wealthy recluse.
-More interesting than that.

161
00:15:05,619 --> 00:15:08,770
Sir August's a fanatical meteorologist.
It runs in the family.

162
00:15:08,859 --> 00:15:11,657
Mother called April, sisters: May, June--

163
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:13,292
July, August.

164
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,891
The family does have weather on the brain.
Any other vices?

165
00:15:16,979 --> 00:15:20,255
All of a piece, really.
Sir August's chairman of BROLLY:

166
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:23,259
British Royal Organization
for Lasting Liquid Years.

167
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,728
It's a private group
recruiting top scientists.

168
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:28,731
He thinks British weather has been
tampered with by aliens.

169
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:31,094
They're not too keen on him
at The Ministry.

170
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:33,010
-Mother tells me he left under--
-A cloud?

171
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:33,929
Naturally.

172
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:37,455
If it wouldn't be too much bother,
could you charm him a little?

173
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:39,417
I'll see what I can do.

174
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:41,048
More tea?

175
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:41,969
No, thanks.

176
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:43,128
I meant me.

177
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:50,452
I'll snoop around.

178
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:52,572
You distract him.

179
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:53,814
How?

180
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:55,014
Try...

181
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:56,493
...small talk.

182
00:15:56,619 --> 00:15:57,734
The weather?

183
00:15:57,819 --> 00:16:00,572
Maybe something more feminine.
A woman's touch.

184
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:03,415
-That should do it.
-Think so?

185
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:05,570
Your confidence is overwhelming.

186
00:16:05,739 --> 00:16:06,933
Such modesty.

187
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:09,454
A minor talent. Or hadn't you noticed?

188
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:31,008
Curious.

189
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:32,452
-Miss?
-Mrs.

190
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,208
Mrs.

191
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:40,658
-Thank you.
-Ma'am.

192
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:44,054
Hello?

193
00:17:56,459 --> 00:17:57,414
Hello?

194
00:18:05,939 --> 00:18:06,894
Hello?

195
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:14,254
Hello?

196
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,048
Peel.

197
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:20,848
Emma Peel.

198
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:25,127
You're all wet.

199
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:29,731
Have we met, or is it just the rain
that's familiar?

200
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:32,690
We share a passion, I believe.

201
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:36,128
I have always admired a woman who is...

202
00:18:36,459 --> 00:18:38,290
...meteorologically inclined.

203
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:40,218
Mutual, I'm sure.

204
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,217
The thrill of the monsoon?

205
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:45,017
Ah, yes, the monsoons.

206
00:18:45,339 --> 00:18:48,854
Even as a boy, when Nana taught me
the naming of the clouds....

207
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,693
-Cumulus.
-Yes.

208
00:18:50,979 --> 00:18:52,571
-Stratocumulus.
-Oh, yes.

209
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:53,688
Nimbus.

210
00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:56,858
I discovered then,
nothing beats a good lashing.

211
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:58,247
Mind your head.

212
00:18:58,419 --> 00:18:59,534
Take lndia.

213
00:18:59,979 --> 00:19:02,618
You can have a good ten inches
overnight there.

214
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:04,134
You know...

215
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:06,211
...one should never fear...

216
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:08,527
...being wet.

217
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:12,213
Come this way.

218
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:15,614
Allow me.

219
00:19:15,699 --> 00:19:17,052
These rapid climate changes.

220
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:19,812
-The Ministry needs some answers.
-Oh, that Ministry!

221
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:21,730
Dry enough, don't you think?

222
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:23,728
Do you mind?

223
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:25,248
Very well.

224
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:27,570
I need a specialist's opinion.

225
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:30,418
Theoretically speaking,
if I wanted to alter cloud patterns...

226
00:19:30,499 --> 00:19:32,410
...how would I power it?
By microtransmission?

227
00:19:32,499 --> 00:19:34,217
Yes, by microtransmission.

228
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,735
The military applications were never
looked into after the Cold War.

229
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:39,730
The hot and the cold war.

230
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:41,212
Hot and cold war?

231
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:42,408
An outdated theory.

232
00:19:42,499 --> 00:19:44,012
Intriguing, but impossible.

233
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,612
Nothing is impossible!

234
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:47,975
Only mathematically improbable.

235
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,129
My dear Dr. Peel, look here.

236
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:54,532
The twisted labellum.

237
00:19:56,579 --> 00:19:59,616
Note the upturned apiculus
on the dorsal sepal.

238
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:01,858
A genetic impossibility.

239
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:03,930
That flower should not exist...

240
00:20:04,219 --> 00:20:05,652
...yet there she is.

241
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:07,974
I did it.

242
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:13,973
Beautiful, no?

243
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:18,538
Touch it, Dr. Peel.

244
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:20,778
I feel I'm wasting my time.

245
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:22,292
No, please touch it.

246
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:25,771
I'm sorry to trouble you.
It's obvious you know nothing.

247
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:27,733
I know nothing?

248
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:32,248
I have forgotten more than those fools
at The Ministry ever knew!

249
00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:36,414
The ratio of protons to ions...

250
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:38,169
...me!

251
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:41,173
The entire Microtransmission Theory...

252
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:42,375
...me!

253
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:43,812
I did it all!

254
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:46,134
Tea?

255
00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:24,449
Hello?

256
00:21:26,139 --> 00:21:27,015
Hello?

257
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:29,533
Private property. No trespassing.

258
00:21:29,979 --> 00:21:31,458
Sorry! I can't hear you!

259
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:33,973
Private property. No trespassing.

260
00:21:39,739 --> 00:21:41,491
I say, this is a bit much!

261
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,727
Perhaps your friend would like to join us.

262
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:45,928
My friend?

263
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:48,569
Some rather nasty weather out there.

264
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:51,578
Perhaps he's lost.

265
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:53,812
I don't think so.

266
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:57,530
We don't get many trespassers up here.

267
00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:58,574
Really?

268
00:21:59,019 --> 00:21:59,974
Why not?

269
00:22:00,459 --> 00:22:01,653
We shoot them.

270
00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:05,174
Sugar?

271
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:50,211
Is that you, Mrs. Peel?

272
00:22:57,699 --> 00:22:59,132
Manners, Mrs. Peel.

273
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:08,134
Steed?

274
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:12,214
Steed?

275
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:17,373
There you are.

276
00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:18,654
Tea?

277
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:20,614
With lemon.

278
00:23:20,979 --> 00:23:23,095
Grape? I bought them specially.

279
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:29,097
I hope you don't mind me taking liberties.

280
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:30,692
I had to tuck you up in bed.

281
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:32,849
You didn't seem in good shape
when I found you.

282
00:23:32,939 --> 00:23:34,372
I was frozen stiff.

283
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:37,457
Now I feel much revived.

284
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:39,332
Not me you should thank for that.

285
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,729
Actually, I wasn't about to.
I recall a very strange thing.

286
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:45,089
You tried to shoot me, didn't you?

287
00:23:45,339 --> 00:23:46,977
I would never shoot you.

288
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:50,217
-Not without my reasons.
-I remember it clearly.

289
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:52,177
One shot to the heart.

290
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:54,052
But, luckily, my...

291
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:57,088
...Trubshaw waistcoat was bulletproof.

292
00:23:57,219 --> 00:23:59,858
Silly me, I thought you were
just overdressed.

293
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,257
"Be prepared." ls that your motto?

294
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:05,376
I thought it best to take precautions.
One never knows.

295
00:24:05,499 --> 00:24:07,854
I suppose Mother warned you
about women like me.

296
00:24:07,939 --> 00:24:10,294
Until now, I didn't know
there were women like you.

297
00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:13,735
Obviously, I'm the sort
that doesn't take "no" for an answer.

298
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:17,209
I think that would depend entirely
on the question, Mrs. Peel.

299
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:22,052
I say, you definitely are Mrs. Peel,
aren't you?

300
00:24:22,139 --> 00:24:23,367
You're delirious.

301
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:25,177
I should've abandoned you.

302
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:28,737
Nursing an invalid isn't my idea of fun,
after all.

303
00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:31,251
I could've taken up any amount of offers.

304
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:32,294
And?

305
00:24:32,379 --> 00:24:34,813
I did find a clue at Sir August's.

306
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:40,012
You see, Steed...

307
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:42,097
...a woman's touch....

308
00:24:43,419 --> 00:24:45,011
"Wonderland Weather."

309
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:51,814
Hello.

310
00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:53,298
Wonderland Weather?

311
00:24:53,379 --> 00:24:54,334
Yes.

312
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:58,657
You've been recommended by a friend who
said you'd know all about our problem.

313
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:02,289
We're awfully worried about our roses.

314
00:25:03,939 --> 00:25:05,372
I don't understand.

315
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:07,415
My colleague and I represent...

316
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,495
...a very influential group
of flower growers...

317
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:12,332
...working under
tremendously adverse conditions.

318
00:25:12,699 --> 00:25:15,338
For some years,
we've been breeding a special rose...

319
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:16,977
...the Crimson Monk...

320
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,897
...until in the past week
we've been plagued by...

321
00:25:20,139 --> 00:25:21,333
...ladybirds.

322
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:23,615
I thought ladybirds loved roses.

323
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:27,057
A little too much, apparently.
Now our flower show's coming up.

324
00:25:27,139 --> 00:25:29,892
We need a few more warm summer days
very quickly.

325
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:31,614
Yes.

326
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:36,375
Have you seen the seven-spotted ladybird
in the mating season?

327
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:39,017
Speckled grey larvae?

328
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:40,933
A month to...

329
00:25:41,699 --> 00:25:43,257
...pupate, then...

330
00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:45,892
...no more roses.

331
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:47,088
Voracious.

332
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:49,891
I hope I haven't come to the wrong place.

333
00:25:49,979 --> 00:25:52,288
I was recommended
by a member of BROLLY.

334
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:53,849
BROLLY?

335
00:25:53,939 --> 00:25:56,009
Don't say you haven't heard of it.

336
00:25:56,219 --> 00:25:58,687
I was speaking to my colleague,
Sir August.

337
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:01,494
You do know Sir August de Wynter?

338
00:26:01,819 --> 00:26:02,854
Of course.

339
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:08,932
Welcome to Wonderland Weather,
here in our London headquarters.

340
00:26:09,939 --> 00:26:12,658
Now, allied with our colleagues
from BROLLY...

341
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:15,369
...together we will make history.

342
00:26:22,899 --> 00:26:24,537
You all know who I am...

343
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:26,771
...and I know all of you...

344
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:29,214
...but you cannot know one another.

345
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:30,848
Security...

346
00:26:30,939 --> 00:26:32,531
...is still paramount.

347
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,854
Our organization now faces...

348
00:26:36,339 --> 00:26:37,977
...its greatest test.

349
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:40,688
Therefore...

350
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:43,174
...l demand absolute loyalty...

351
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:45,457
...absolute obedience.

352
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:48,815
But if anybody wishes to resign...

353
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:50,851
...he must do so now.

354
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:55,374
And in recognition of your work...

355
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:58,571
...a generous offer of $1 million awaits you.

356
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:06,488
Now...

357
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:09,011
...does anybody wish...

358
00:27:09,579 --> 00:27:10,728
...to resign?

359
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:15,571
Please don't be shy.

360
00:27:22,739 --> 00:27:23,694
Well.

361
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:27,688
Well, now.

362
00:27:28,859 --> 00:27:30,929
We owe so much to both of you.

363
00:27:31,219 --> 00:27:34,416
Without your work,
my humble project would perish.

364
00:27:36,379 --> 00:27:38,654
How can I show my appreciation?

365
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:48,212
Any other business?

366
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:51,329
-You actually sell weather here?
-Yes.

367
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:54,213
Our newest line: Summer or winter.

368
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:58,093
Tuscany or Gstaad. Natural weather
delivered down your phone line.

369
00:27:58,459 --> 00:28:00,450
All you'll need is a radio transmitter.

370
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:01,654
How real...

371
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:03,493
...will it feel?

372
00:28:03,579 --> 00:28:04,489
Very.

373
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:07,179
A whole new line
in personalized meteorology.

374
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:11,093
Imagine...an autumn mist, dappled
sunshine through an autumn glade.

375
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:12,809
Temperature--

376
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,218
Around 65°?

377
00:28:16,939 --> 00:28:18,258
Whatever you fancy, sir.

378
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:19,374
Marvelous.

379
00:28:19,499 --> 00:28:22,696
A solution to matters meteorological
and horticultural...

380
00:28:23,139 --> 00:28:24,857
...and to my roses.

381
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:30,695
Excuse me.

382
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:31,894
Hurry back.

383
00:29:09,139 --> 00:29:11,573
Babbington, head of Prospero Research.

384
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:13,168
And?

385
00:29:13,339 --> 00:29:14,135
Morton...

386
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,572
...his assistant.

387
00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:36,612
I'll take the high road.

388
00:29:36,699 --> 00:29:38,451
And I'll take the low road.

389
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:28,213
Good morning.

390
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:35,973
That was a very silly thing to do.

391
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:18,408
Mrs. Peel?

392
00:32:30,219 --> 00:32:33,131
-Just in time to save me from myself.
-Are you all right?

393
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:35,130
I thought I was seeing double.

394
00:32:35,939 --> 00:32:37,452
That makes two of us.

395
00:32:44,139 --> 00:32:46,289
So now you're saying
there are two Mrs. Peels?

396
00:32:46,379 --> 00:32:49,257
-Preposterous!
-Let me handle this. I'm in charge.

397
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:50,658
We both know who's responsible.

398
00:32:50,739 --> 00:32:53,094
This story is a complete red herring.
It's quite impossible.

399
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:57,138
Nothing is impossible. I often think
of six impossible things before breakfast.

400
00:32:57,219 --> 00:32:59,016
Thank you for your contribution.

401
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:01,659
And now will you kindly allow me
to continue?

402
00:33:02,979 --> 00:33:04,731
Steed, you were saying?

403
00:33:05,219 --> 00:33:08,256
I was saying someone's recruiting
your Prospero scientists...

404
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:10,250
...under a cover organization.

405
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:12,771
But it's not Mrs. Peel.

406
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:16,769
If you're so sure of her innocence,
do you have another suspect?

407
00:33:16,899 --> 00:33:17,888
I may.

408
00:33:18,379 --> 00:33:20,290
What makes you so sure of an attack?

409
00:33:20,379 --> 00:33:23,371
The World Council of Ministers is meeting
on St. Swithin's Day...

410
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,653
...the patron saint of weather--

411
00:33:24,739 --> 00:33:25,694
You see?

412
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:27,690
I do see. That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

413
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:30,532
I saw both Mrs. Peels, with my own eyes.

414
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:36,294
We can't waste any more time.
He has his orders.

415
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:37,812
I'm counting on you, Steed.

416
00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:39,571
The clock is ticking.

417
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:28,135
A perfect dress rehearsal.

418
00:34:34,299 --> 00:34:37,496
Mother and Father are convinced
an attack will take place.

419
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:41,848
Could someone like Sir August
really target a kind of weather bomb?

420
00:34:43,299 --> 00:34:44,732
Queen to rook five.

421
00:34:44,859 --> 00:34:48,898
If they knew what they were doing.
It's all a question of protons and ions.

422
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:50,134
Do explain.

423
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:53,257
Left on their own, they repel each other.
Very unstable.

424
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:54,852
Knight to knight four.

425
00:34:55,499 --> 00:34:58,809
To achieve fusion,
they require a little extra oomph.

426
00:34:59,899 --> 00:35:02,459
A gentle embrace, as opposed to a clinch.

427
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:05,533
Low excitation energy,
technically speaking.

428
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:06,688
Then, boom.

429
00:35:07,419 --> 00:35:08,374
Exactly.

430
00:35:09,259 --> 00:35:10,897
The pawn to knight four.

431
00:35:11,259 --> 00:35:14,012
Look, I've been charting
these weather outbreaks.

432
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:16,056
Pawn to queen's knight three.

433
00:35:16,459 --> 00:35:18,734
-Are you paying attention?
-Absolutely.

434
00:35:18,819 --> 00:35:20,730
A believer in firm discipline.

435
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:22,458
Do you always obey orders?

436
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:23,494
Always.

437
00:35:23,899 --> 00:35:25,332
Except when I don't.

438
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:27,732
Knight to queen five.

439
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:33,617
For example, if I were, perish the thought,
under orders to kill you....

440
00:35:34,259 --> 00:35:36,693
-Pity you never told me.
-You never asked.

441
00:35:36,899 --> 00:35:40,528
I can't mention everything.
Besides, we were getting along so well.

442
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:42,416
You didn't want to spoil the fun.

443
00:35:42,499 --> 00:35:45,059
It would've put a damper on things,
don't you agree?

444
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:46,333
I'm intrigued.

445
00:35:46,779 --> 00:35:48,656
Pawn to queen's bishop three.

446
00:35:49,219 --> 00:35:52,177
What did you have in mind?
Nothing too messy, I hope.

447
00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:54,733
No need to dwell on the unsavory aspects.

448
00:35:54,859 --> 00:35:58,135
After all, according to your file,
you're a psychopathic personality...

449
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:01,416
...with schizophrenic delusions,
suffering from recurring amnesia...

450
00:36:01,499 --> 00:36:03,137
...based on traumatic repression...

451
00:36:03,219 --> 00:36:06,450
...leading to outbursts
of antisocial and violent behavior.

452
00:36:07,939 --> 00:36:09,452
Knight to king seven.

453
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:10,729
Check.

454
00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:15,249
Is that really what you think of me?

455
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:17,094
Well...

456
00:36:17,379 --> 00:36:19,131
...just my type, Mrs. Peel.

457
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:24,094
Good, because I think I found something.

458
00:36:25,339 --> 00:36:27,250
You never fail to surprise me.

459
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:28,733
On this map...

460
00:36:31,259 --> 00:36:32,169
...here...

461
00:36:32,259 --> 00:36:35,137
...a cluster of microclimates
around a single area.

462
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:36,692
Very, very strange.

463
00:36:37,339 --> 00:36:39,569
Time to pay Sir August another visit.

464
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:43,768
Your move.

465
00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:47,212
Queen takes knight.

466
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:49,808
Checkmate.

467
00:36:52,779 --> 00:36:54,132
It's just a game.

468
00:36:57,139 --> 00:36:59,972
I can't hold off The Ministry much longer.

469
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:04,207
This Mrs. Peel, I'm warning you,
don't let her get too close.

470
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:08,333
Good shot.

471
00:37:13,579 --> 00:37:16,412
Don't worry. I'll take care of Mrs. Peel.

472
00:37:19,419 --> 00:37:21,853
You're playing rather well today, Father.

473
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:24,609
-Shall we double the bet?
-Yes.

474
00:37:26,139 --> 00:37:28,653
I've never been able
to refuse you anything.

475
00:37:32,299 --> 00:37:33,209
Pity.

476
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:34,808
Just missed.

477
00:37:40,499 --> 00:37:41,488
I win again.

478
00:37:59,899 --> 00:38:03,255
I thought you lived on the edge, Mrs. Peel.
Is this as fast as you can go?

479
00:38:03,339 --> 00:38:05,728
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?

480
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:08,052
We're being followed.

481
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:10,578
What's that noise?

482
00:38:19,659 --> 00:38:20,614
Insects.

483
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:22,138
Bigger every year.

484
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:29,095
Sir August thinks of everything.

485
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:35,694
Hold on.

486
00:39:44,779 --> 00:39:45,814
Let's go!

487
00:40:29,659 --> 00:40:30,728
Head down.

488
00:41:11,419 --> 00:41:14,172
Would you please be so kind
as to hit the ground...

489
00:41:14,259 --> 00:41:16,250
...if it's not too much trouble?

490
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:26,097
I hope he was a baddy.

491
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:28,774
My name's Alice.
Mother said you'd be on your way.

492
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:31,248
-John Steed.
-And this must be Mrs. Peel.

493
00:41:31,459 --> 00:41:32,812
Mrs. Peel, Alice.

494
00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:37,053
How do you do?

495
00:41:43,379 --> 00:41:44,858
Cocky little bastard.

496
00:41:45,259 --> 00:41:46,214
Indeed.

497
00:41:46,419 --> 00:41:48,649
-Are you with Mother or Father?
-Both, actually.

498
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:52,095
I'm glad to hear they're together at last.
They don't get along.

499
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:54,488
Promotion, top job, most unfair.

500
00:41:55,259 --> 00:41:57,250
-Quite a fuss at The Ministry.
-You don't say.

501
00:41:57,339 --> 00:41:59,330
I think we should be on our way.

502
00:42:01,059 --> 00:42:03,493
Someone didn't want you
to get to the party.

503
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:05,649
I expect we'll have to gatecrash.

504
00:42:11,419 --> 00:42:13,375
This way. I know a back way in.

505
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:31,688
Excuse me.

506
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:34,249
You are a Gemini, Mrs. Peel?

507
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:36,498
How did you guess?

508
00:42:45,859 --> 00:42:48,737
Let's take separate paths.
We'll meet in the middle.

509
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:49,808
Perfect.

510
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:56,775
Ah, yes, it's clear now.
A love maze in a trapezoid shape.

511
00:42:57,099 --> 00:42:58,293
A love maze.

512
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:01,332
Originally late-17th-century design,
then copied.

513
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:14,290
Over here, by your side.

514
00:43:15,019 --> 00:43:16,213
I was worried.

515
00:43:16,379 --> 00:43:19,689
-How touching. Afraid you'd lost me?
-No, that you might escape.

516
00:43:19,779 --> 00:43:21,053
Still suspicious?

517
00:43:21,139 --> 00:43:24,529
Just wondering if you'd brought me here
under false pretenses.

518
00:43:24,939 --> 00:43:27,578
Frankly, I'm amazed.
Perhaps I should run away.

519
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:29,777
I'll have to give chase.

520
00:43:30,139 --> 00:43:31,208
I'll hide.

521
00:43:31,299 --> 00:43:32,527
How romantic.

522
00:43:32,699 --> 00:43:33,654
Do try.

523
00:43:48,939 --> 00:43:50,452
Sir August de Wynter.

524
00:43:50,539 --> 00:43:51,654
John Steed.

525
00:43:56,419 --> 00:43:59,217
An old trick I learned
from a dervish in lstanbul.

526
00:43:59,379 --> 00:44:00,573
Turkish rules.

527
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:03,250
-If you insist.
-Then try this.

528
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:08,811
A man with an umbrella...

529
00:44:08,899 --> 00:44:10,571
...is a man praying for rain.

530
00:44:10,659 --> 00:44:14,447
And a man without one is a fool.
Never trust the weather, Sir August.

531
00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:16,853
Rain or shine...

532
00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:18,767
...all is mine.

533
00:44:50,459 --> 00:44:52,097
So glad you could come.

534
00:44:52,699 --> 00:44:54,417
I thought I'd drop in.

535
00:44:55,939 --> 00:44:57,088
Comfortable?

536
00:44:57,899 --> 00:44:58,934
How cozy.

537
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:01,172
Just the two of us?

538
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:03,494
Yes, like spoons in a drawer.

539
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:08,491
Perhaps I could help you,
if I knew what you wanted.

540
00:45:11,179 --> 00:45:12,817
The only thing I want...

541
00:45:13,299 --> 00:45:14,368
...is you.

542
00:45:15,059 --> 00:45:16,208
How touching.

543
00:45:16,499 --> 00:45:17,818
Join me, Emma...

544
00:45:18,219 --> 00:45:19,891
...and we have the world.

545
00:45:20,499 --> 00:45:22,455
You would have to say "please."

546
00:45:22,979 --> 00:45:24,128
But of course.

547
00:45:24,539 --> 00:45:25,733
If you insist.

548
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:30,774
Please.

549
00:45:33,499 --> 00:45:34,978
When you awaken...

550
00:45:35,459 --> 00:45:37,370
...you will remember nothing.

551
00:45:38,899 --> 00:45:40,537
Remember nothing.

552
00:45:41,779 --> 00:45:44,054
Steed? Steed, are you all right?

553
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:49,530
I thought I was seeing double again.

554
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:50,654
You were.

555
00:45:50,819 --> 00:45:52,411
A Gemini, definitely.

556
00:45:53,499 --> 00:45:55,569
No time to lose. Here's the plan.

557
00:47:17,139 --> 00:47:21,098
Raffle tickets? Church fete.
Could I possibly winkle a cake out of you?

558
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:22,738
Or perhaps a small donation?

559
00:47:22,819 --> 00:47:24,013
Not today, thank you.

560
00:47:24,099 --> 00:47:27,330
Do come. Tombola, Lucky Dip,
Pin the Tail on the Donkey--

561
00:47:27,419 --> 00:47:28,852
Nor any other day!

562
00:47:28,939 --> 00:47:31,817
If you're going to be difficult,
I'm afraid I'll have to insist.

563
00:47:31,899 --> 00:47:33,298
Where's Mrs. Peel?

564
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:05,688
Mrs. Peel?

565
00:50:14,299 --> 00:50:16,369
Don't worry, you're in my flat.

566
00:50:17,339 --> 00:50:18,374
Quite safe.

567
00:50:18,459 --> 00:50:19,972
What am I doing here?

568
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:21,128
Having tea.

569
00:50:21,939 --> 00:50:23,088
Is that all?

570
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:24,971
After a manner of speaking.

571
00:50:25,979 --> 00:50:27,173
Your boots...

572
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:29,458
...from Trubshaw.

573
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:36,612
They might be useful.

574
00:50:39,179 --> 00:50:40,214
Allow me.

575
00:50:44,179 --> 00:50:45,373
I was worried.

576
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:48,132
What happened to you?

577
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,370
I remember the maze, a house...

578
00:50:50,979 --> 00:50:52,173
...some music.

579
00:50:53,459 --> 00:50:55,415
-Then nothing.
-Try to remember.

580
00:50:56,979 --> 00:50:58,128
It's very important.

581
00:50:58,219 --> 00:51:00,335
I believe you're in extreme danger.

582
00:51:01,699 --> 00:51:03,576
You'd better stay here with me.

583
00:51:03,659 --> 00:51:04,614
Is that wise?

584
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:07,338
You'll be safer here.
We can talk things through.

585
00:51:07,419 --> 00:51:08,738
An official debriefing.

586
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:10,172
No interruptions.

587
00:51:10,539 --> 00:51:12,655
You live alone? No Mrs. Steed?

588
00:51:13,339 --> 00:51:14,977
Well, since you ask....

589
00:51:16,059 --> 00:51:18,289
Mrs. Steed lives in Wiltshire.

590
00:51:21,259 --> 00:51:22,328
My mother.

591
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:25,494
I had you down as a creature of habit.

592
00:51:25,939 --> 00:51:27,292
A bachelor's life.

593
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,177
It's worked quite well, until now.

594
00:51:29,259 --> 00:51:31,170
Don't tell me you never met the right girl.

595
00:51:31,259 --> 00:51:32,294
There's always the exception.

596
00:51:32,379 --> 00:51:33,414
That proves the rule?

597
00:51:33,499 --> 00:51:36,252
Quite. You're exceptional in many things.

598
00:51:37,179 --> 00:51:38,055
But duty...

599
00:51:38,139 --> 00:51:39,538
...comes first.

600
00:51:41,179 --> 00:51:42,737
Shall we make a start?

601
00:51:42,979 --> 00:51:44,970
A time and place for everything.

602
00:51:50,979 --> 00:51:51,889
Now...

603
00:51:52,899 --> 00:51:54,935
...is definitely the time.

604
00:52:00,499 --> 00:52:01,648
And the place.

605
00:52:05,819 --> 00:52:06,888
Too tight.

606
00:52:07,659 --> 00:52:08,648
Push.

607
00:52:17,899 --> 00:52:19,014
Do come in.

608
00:52:19,739 --> 00:52:20,808
I didn't hear you knock.

609
00:52:20,899 --> 00:52:24,858
We can dispense with formalities.
I want Mrs. Peel. Interrogation.

610
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:26,851
Nothing I could do about it.

611
00:52:26,939 --> 00:52:29,499
Security restrictions, Steed, applied to you.

612
00:52:30,139 --> 00:52:32,050
Mrs. Peel is under arrest.

613
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:36,768
In you go.

614
00:52:41,939 --> 00:52:43,133
Sorry, Steed.

615
00:52:43,339 --> 00:52:46,775
Father's taken control.
She always wanted Mother off the case.

616
00:52:50,139 --> 00:52:53,131
There's only one place to go,
but I'll need clearance.

617
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:54,568
I'll fix it.

618
00:53:36,819 --> 00:53:37,729
Hello?

619
00:53:37,819 --> 00:53:38,808
Hello.

620
00:53:39,699 --> 00:53:41,849
Brenda told me to expect you, Steed.

621
00:53:43,699 --> 00:53:44,609
Hello?

622
00:53:45,459 --> 00:53:46,494
Talk to the pipe.

623
00:53:46,579 --> 00:53:48,012
That usually helps.

624
00:53:48,979 --> 00:53:50,173
Colonel Jones?

625
00:53:50,739 --> 00:53:52,969
Don't worry about me being invisible.

626
00:53:53,459 --> 00:53:55,734
Other than that, I'm perfectly normal.

627
00:53:56,259 --> 00:53:57,214
I see.

628
00:53:57,459 --> 00:53:58,892
Or rather, you don't.

629
00:53:58,979 --> 00:54:03,211
Learnt the trick in camouflage, till
the accident made rather a mess of things.

630
00:54:03,539 --> 00:54:05,018
Now I'm stuck away in the basement.

631
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:06,612
Lucky if I even get the tea trolley.

632
00:54:06,699 --> 00:54:08,849
I'm afraid I don't have much time.

633
00:54:08,939 --> 00:54:11,328
I'd like you to take a look at this map.

634
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:17,410
I want to know something more about...

635
00:54:17,499 --> 00:54:19,171
...the Prospero Program.

636
00:54:20,939 --> 00:54:22,452
Where'd you find this?

637
00:54:22,539 --> 00:54:23,972
Wonderland Weather.

638
00:54:25,219 --> 00:54:26,937
Retail meteorology.

639
00:54:32,179 --> 00:54:34,613
I believe you've jogged my memory, Steed.

640
00:54:35,299 --> 00:54:37,767
I may have to dig a little deeper, though.

641
00:54:39,779 --> 00:54:40,734
Shall l?

642
00:54:41,019 --> 00:54:42,088
Follow me.

643
00:54:45,339 --> 00:54:47,978
Hello, Mrs. Peel.
Welcome back to The Ministry.

644
00:54:48,099 --> 00:54:49,578
Now, we're going to have a talk.

645
00:54:49,659 --> 00:54:51,650
About the weather? How topical.

646
00:54:51,939 --> 00:54:53,258
It'll help pass the time.

647
00:54:53,339 --> 00:54:55,648
Time would pass anyway,
if you think about it logically.

648
00:54:55,739 --> 00:54:57,809
But so few do think logically
or even anti-logically.

649
00:54:57,899 --> 00:55:00,732
Clockwise or anti-clockwise. Tick-tock,
tock-tick. Seesaw, Margery Daw.

650
00:55:00,819 --> 00:55:05,131
It amounts to the same thing. After all,
how do you know I'm the real Mrs. Peel?

651
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:07,528
How real do you feel, Mrs. Peel?

652
00:55:07,979 --> 00:55:09,094
I'll repeat the question...

653
00:55:09,179 --> 00:55:12,694
...bypassing the weather, which,
being British, we'll return to in a moment.

654
00:55:12,779 --> 00:55:15,168
Do I walk like Mrs. Peel?
Talk like Mrs. Peel?

655
00:55:15,259 --> 00:55:17,409
Am I witty, wise, wonderful to know?

656
00:55:17,779 --> 00:55:19,815
Or do I go around shooting
Ministry agents...

657
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:21,890
...attempting to rule the world
on my days off?

658
00:55:21,979 --> 00:55:23,935
Now you'rejust playing games.

659
00:55:32,699 --> 00:55:35,088
Of course! The Ministry cloning program.

660
00:55:35,459 --> 00:55:38,257
Sir August ran it,
but it appears he went too far.

661
00:55:38,539 --> 00:55:40,928
Some of his more advanced experiments...

662
00:55:41,459 --> 00:55:42,733
...are not too pleasant.

663
00:55:42,819 --> 00:55:44,537
So they pulled him off it.

664
00:55:45,539 --> 00:55:46,813
Anything else?

665
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:50,733
As I recall, there was some
former Ministry land used...

666
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:55,415
...as a secret military installation
and sold by us to Sir August years ago.

667
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:58,610
And authorized by Father.

668
00:55:59,819 --> 00:56:01,616
Eeny-meeny-miny-mole.

669
00:56:04,059 --> 00:56:05,651
And this is the site.

670
00:56:07,419 --> 00:56:08,738
But where is it?

671
00:56:08,899 --> 00:56:12,812
According to your map, it's an island
right here in the middle of London.

672
00:56:15,219 --> 00:56:17,813
It must be where he's controlling
the weather.

673
00:56:21,659 --> 00:56:23,217
Why did you never tell anyone?

674
00:56:23,299 --> 00:56:24,857
Nobody ever asked.

675
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:31,495
These changes in weather are controlled
and aggressive.

676
00:56:31,979 --> 00:56:34,891
Yes, Prime Minister.
We're monitoring the situation.

677
00:56:35,259 --> 00:56:38,171
The Council of Ministers is now
in emergency session.

678
00:56:40,579 --> 00:56:43,047
The weather is getting worse
by the minute.

679
00:56:53,459 --> 00:56:54,414
Now...

680
00:56:54,899 --> 00:56:57,049
...is the winter ofyour discontent.

681
00:56:58,579 --> 00:56:59,694
Above you...

682
00:57:00,259 --> 00:57:02,011
...the weather is changing.

683
00:57:02,859 --> 00:57:04,690
The temperature is dropping.

684
00:57:05,699 --> 00:57:07,371
Soon it will be freezing.

685
00:57:09,379 --> 00:57:10,368
Why?

686
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:14,935
Because the weather is no longer
in God's hands, but in mine.

687
00:57:19,259 --> 00:57:20,453
Those clouds...

688
00:57:20,539 --> 00:57:22,291
...all controlled by me...

689
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:24,450
...are recreating the weather.

690
00:57:25,499 --> 00:57:27,012
I have set off...

691
00:57:27,579 --> 00:57:29,137
...a chain reaction...

692
00:57:30,259 --> 00:57:33,695
...that will paralyze
and ultimately destroy the city.

693
00:57:37,299 --> 00:57:38,618
The countdown...

694
00:57:39,219 --> 00:57:40,732
...has already begun.

695
00:57:43,179 --> 00:57:45,568
And this is merely the beginning!

696
00:57:46,139 --> 00:57:48,016
This is outrageous! It's blackmail!

697
00:57:48,099 --> 00:57:49,452
Do shut up!

698
00:57:51,539 --> 00:57:54,292
Hundreds of millions will die.
They'll drown...

699
00:57:55,019 --> 00:57:56,088
...burn...

700
00:57:56,299 --> 00:57:57,368
...freeze.

701
00:57:59,339 --> 00:58:00,249
You...

702
00:58:00,779 --> 00:58:02,497
...and your governments...

703
00:58:02,699 --> 00:58:04,052
...have no choice.

704
00:58:06,499 --> 00:58:08,649
You will buy your weather from me...

705
00:58:10,459 --> 00:58:12,814
...and, by God, you'll pay for it.

706
00:58:13,579 --> 00:58:14,773
Unacceptable!

707
00:58:16,219 --> 00:58:20,451
Any attempt at interference will
only lead to automatic annihilation.

708
00:58:23,419 --> 00:58:24,818
And, by the way...

709
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:27,496
...you have until midnight...

710
00:58:29,659 --> 00:58:30,774
...tonight!

711
00:58:39,059 --> 00:58:40,731
Alice, are you all right?

712
00:58:41,659 --> 00:58:43,217
Sir August's demands.

713
00:58:43,379 --> 00:58:46,416
He wants them delivered
directly to the Prime Minister.

714
00:58:48,379 --> 00:58:51,974
"Ten percent of our gross national product
annually." That's preposterous.

715
00:58:52,059 --> 00:58:53,333
There will be no negotiation.

716
00:58:53,419 --> 00:58:54,898
His words exactly.

717
00:58:55,099 --> 00:58:58,978
He says unless we accept his demands,
the weather will get colder and colder...

718
00:58:59,059 --> 00:59:02,051
...until we'll all have to go to hell
just to warm up.

719
00:59:02,979 --> 00:59:05,174
Did Sir August torture you, Alice?

720
00:59:06,539 --> 00:59:08,291
No, he didn't have to.

721
00:59:08,619 --> 00:59:10,052
Knows everything already.

722
00:59:10,139 --> 00:59:12,016
Breach of security, top level.

723
00:59:14,059 --> 00:59:15,128
Father.

724
00:59:18,019 --> 00:59:19,247
Alert security.

725
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:24,653
Sorry, Father.

726
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:26,213
The game's up.

727
00:59:26,299 --> 00:59:29,097
Careful, it might go off.
We don't want another accident.

728
00:59:29,179 --> 00:59:30,851
Half-working, as you are.

729
00:59:31,419 --> 00:59:34,252
Poor Mother, finally figured it out.
But too late.

730
00:59:34,379 --> 00:59:36,335
Nonsense. Mother knows best.

731
00:59:36,779 --> 00:59:38,735
I want you to release Mrs. Peel.

732
00:59:39,059 --> 00:59:40,128
Certainly.

733
00:59:40,219 --> 00:59:41,447
But which one?

734
00:59:52,699 --> 00:59:54,894
It really isn't Mother's day.

735
01:00:24,859 --> 01:00:26,258
On course to base.

736
01:00:26,379 --> 01:00:29,052
Seven degrees east, north by northwest.

737
01:00:30,939 --> 01:00:32,372
Navigation control.

738
01:00:32,699 --> 01:00:34,610
Anti-cyclone. Pull the right.

739
01:00:34,979 --> 01:00:36,890
I have Mrs. Peel on board...

740
01:00:37,099 --> 01:00:38,691
...and heading back to base.

741
01:00:38,779 --> 01:00:41,168
We'll keep you informed of our progress.

742
01:00:41,539 --> 01:00:42,858
Message end.

743
01:01:11,939 --> 01:01:13,975
The balloon, Steed. The balloon.

744
01:01:14,059 --> 01:01:15,412
Don't mind me.

745
01:01:38,659 --> 01:01:39,978
You're drifting.

746
01:01:49,179 --> 01:01:52,057
You're drifting off course.
You're losing altitude.

747
01:02:00,459 --> 01:02:02,131
You've drifted off course!

748
01:03:54,099 --> 01:03:55,851
Prince Charming, I presume?

749
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:57,532
Hardly, I'm afraid.

750
01:03:59,659 --> 01:04:02,127
A micro-tag concealed in your boots.

751
01:04:03,379 --> 01:04:04,528
Thank you....

752
01:04:04,699 --> 01:04:05,848
Trubshaw.

753
01:04:07,939 --> 01:04:09,338
Are you all right?

754
01:04:12,699 --> 01:04:14,610
And the other Mrs. Peel?

755
01:04:15,379 --> 01:04:16,858
Dispatched, I think.

756
01:04:18,019 --> 01:04:19,213
Sad, in a way.

757
01:04:19,779 --> 01:04:21,337
Here, let me help you.

758
01:04:38,459 --> 01:04:39,687
I wonder....

759
01:05:11,899 --> 01:05:13,890
Unless I'm very much mistaken...

760
01:05:14,939 --> 01:05:16,657
...that was a kiss, Steed.

761
01:05:18,699 --> 01:05:19,654
Yes.

762
01:05:20,939 --> 01:05:22,088
Technically.

763
01:05:22,779 --> 01:05:23,928
"Technically?"

764
01:05:24,059 --> 01:05:27,369
Well, I would never presume.
It was more in the spirit of...

765
01:05:27,779 --> 01:05:29,337
...scientific inquiry.

766
01:05:30,779 --> 01:05:32,735
Hard evidence, you might say.

767
01:05:33,539 --> 01:05:35,177
I realized that immediately.

768
01:05:35,259 --> 01:05:36,658
Of course you did.

769
01:05:36,979 --> 01:05:38,935
I needed proof that you were...

770
01:05:40,499 --> 01:05:42,137
...definitely Mrs. Peel.

771
01:05:43,019 --> 01:05:43,974
I see.

772
01:05:45,219 --> 01:05:46,254
And...

773
01:05:47,659 --> 01:05:48,853
...convinced?

774
01:05:50,139 --> 01:05:51,288
Well, I'm...

775
01:05:52,179 --> 01:05:53,578
...still thinking.

776
01:05:54,499 --> 01:05:57,013
Dense cloud formations
moving northeast, sir.

777
01:05:58,459 --> 01:06:00,415
Some sort of radio transmitter.

778
01:06:02,139 --> 01:06:04,528
Of course we have it under control, sir.

779
01:06:06,619 --> 01:06:08,530
Not quite under control, but--

780
01:06:10,779 --> 01:06:11,814
Yes, sir.

781
01:06:12,459 --> 01:06:13,858
I understand, sir.

782
01:06:14,539 --> 01:06:17,007
Our agents are on the case right now, sir.

783
01:06:18,659 --> 01:06:20,012
Two of them, sir.

784
01:06:21,659 --> 01:06:22,614
A man...

785
01:06:23,339 --> 01:06:24,818
...and a woman, sir.

786
01:06:46,979 --> 01:06:48,128
According to Colonel Jones...

787
01:06:48,219 --> 01:06:52,098
...this is the site of a Ministry installation
sold off years ago to--

788
01:06:52,259 --> 01:06:54,295
-Wonderland Weather, I bet.
-Quite.

789
01:07:22,019 --> 01:07:23,452
Something up ahead.

790
01:07:31,259 --> 01:07:32,977
Alas, poor Teddy....

791
01:07:33,659 --> 01:07:35,058
I knew him, Steed.

792
01:07:35,539 --> 01:07:36,608
Penrose...

793
01:07:37,459 --> 01:07:39,450
...head of Antimatter Fission...

794
01:07:39,619 --> 01:07:40,813
...at Prospero.

795
01:07:41,819 --> 01:07:43,969
The teddy bears are having a picnic.

796
01:07:44,179 --> 01:07:45,612
We're getting warm.

797
01:07:54,059 --> 01:07:55,412
Seems familiar.

798
01:08:02,419 --> 01:08:04,091
Mrs. Peel, you're needed.

799
01:08:08,619 --> 01:08:09,688
Excuse me.

800
01:08:10,299 --> 01:08:12,210
Equipment needs adjusting.

801
01:08:12,699 --> 01:08:14,337
Nothing broken, I hope.

802
01:08:14,499 --> 01:08:15,727
My umbrella.

803
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:18,458
Tight fit in here.

804
01:08:18,979 --> 01:08:20,253
Allow me.

805
01:08:21,659 --> 01:08:23,377
How now, brown cow?

806
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:25,014
Welcome.

807
01:09:05,259 --> 01:09:07,011
There must be a hatch somewhere.

808
01:09:07,099 --> 01:09:10,296
I need to locate the circuits,
break the codes and disconnect the wires.

809
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:11,732
How will you know if it works?

810
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:13,616
I won't, until I make the right connection.

811
01:09:13,699 --> 01:09:15,212
So much for science.

812
01:09:16,539 --> 01:09:18,177
I'll stick to swordplay.

813
01:09:23,819 --> 01:09:25,093
This must be it.

814
01:09:29,739 --> 01:09:30,649
Don't wait for me.

815
01:09:30,739 --> 01:09:32,172
Perish the thought.

816
01:09:32,659 --> 01:09:33,887
Just one thing.

817
01:09:34,019 --> 01:09:35,088
Good luck?

818
01:09:35,299 --> 01:09:38,257
Something like that.
Not that you need it, of course.

819
01:10:05,899 --> 01:10:06,888
Bailey...

820
01:10:07,259 --> 01:10:08,453
...take her.

821
01:10:09,659 --> 01:10:11,217
I'll attend to Steed.

822
01:12:24,859 --> 01:12:26,053
Oh, fuck!

823
01:12:40,299 --> 01:12:41,652
Weather system...

824
01:12:41,779 --> 01:12:43,735
...level one and rising.

825
01:12:48,379 --> 01:12:49,494
Weather system...

826
01:12:49,579 --> 01:12:50,807
...level two...

827
01:12:51,099 --> 01:12:52,293
...and rising.

828
01:12:53,339 --> 01:12:55,057
Storm system activated.

829
01:13:12,859 --> 01:13:14,815
Weather system, level six...

830
01:13:15,419 --> 01:13:16,568
...and rising.

831
01:13:28,619 --> 01:13:31,417
John Steed. What a horse's arse
of a name.

832
01:13:32,379 --> 01:13:34,939
Clearly, you're not a racing man,
Sir August.

833
01:13:35,259 --> 01:13:38,649
Anyway, I have no time for pleasantries.
We have a score to settle.

834
01:13:38,739 --> 01:13:41,207
Are you sure you're up for this, dear boy?

835
01:13:42,699 --> 01:13:44,212
Absolutely, old chap.

836
01:13:52,059 --> 01:13:53,538
You'll pay for that.

837
01:14:02,059 --> 01:14:03,253
Target locked.

838
01:14:08,379 --> 01:14:09,368
Warning.

839
01:14:09,659 --> 01:14:11,490
Weather silo activated.

840
01:14:29,019 --> 01:14:30,452
Not bad for an amateur.

841
01:14:30,539 --> 01:14:32,052
I'm not one to boast.

842
01:14:32,139 --> 01:14:34,448
Modest. And much to be modest about.

843
01:14:50,459 --> 01:14:52,177
Unauthorized entry.

844
01:15:34,379 --> 01:15:35,573
Time to die.

845
01:15:36,619 --> 01:15:37,813
Not just yet.

846
01:17:02,459 --> 01:17:03,653
Was it red...

847
01:17:03,979 --> 01:17:05,412
...or was it black?

848
01:17:08,979 --> 01:17:10,173
Here it goes.

849
01:17:10,819 --> 01:17:12,537
Eeny-meeny-miny....

850
01:17:19,499 --> 01:17:20,534
Shutdown.

851
01:17:21,579 --> 01:17:22,614
Shutdown.

852
01:17:49,819 --> 01:17:50,774
Here...

853
01:17:51,339 --> 01:17:52,488
...Mrs. Peel.

854
01:17:53,259 --> 01:17:54,453
What kept you?

855
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:56,528
The weather.

856
01:18:00,339 --> 01:18:01,613
Auto destruct...

857
01:18:02,139 --> 01:18:03,970
...three, two, one....

858
01:18:08,699 --> 01:18:09,768
You must be joking.

859
01:18:09,859 --> 01:18:12,373
And I thought you had it all under control.

860
01:18:12,899 --> 01:18:14,252
Here. Into the pod.

861
01:18:14,339 --> 01:18:16,057
There must be a way out.

862
01:18:18,739 --> 01:18:19,967
Seal the hatch.

863
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:41,130
Yes, sir. Confirm reports
the storm is dropping.

864
01:18:42,659 --> 01:18:45,298
A spot of internal trouble.
I took a firm grip.

865
01:18:45,819 --> 01:18:47,377
One or two casualties.

866
01:18:47,899 --> 01:18:49,730
No word yet from our people.

867
01:18:51,099 --> 01:18:52,327
Thank you, sir.

868
01:18:53,899 --> 01:18:55,855
Pity about Steed and Mrs. Peel.

869
01:18:56,739 --> 01:18:58,092
Missing in action?

870
01:18:59,099 --> 01:19:01,977
Better send out a search party.
You never can tell.

871
01:19:34,459 --> 01:19:36,848
"The owl and the pussycat went to sea."

872
01:19:37,099 --> 01:19:39,169
"ln a beautiful pea-green boat."

873
01:19:39,699 --> 01:19:41,098
A perfect morning.

874
01:19:41,179 --> 01:19:42,248
Bit chilly.

875
01:19:42,539 --> 01:19:44,609
I think we deserve some champagne.

876
01:19:53,659 --> 01:19:54,728
A toast...

877
01:19:54,899 --> 01:19:56,457
...to a job well done.

878
01:19:56,619 --> 01:19:58,052
To a narrow escape.

879
01:19:59,739 --> 01:20:00,774
Macaroon?

880
01:20:02,779 --> 01:20:04,132
Thank you, Steed.

881
01:20:04,379 --> 01:20:05,334
No, no.

882
01:20:05,779 --> 01:20:07,417
Thank you, Mrs. Peel.
