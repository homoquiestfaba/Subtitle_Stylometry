1
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,552
<i>I can't say what made me</i>
<i>fall in love with Vietnam.</i>

2
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,392
<i>That a woman's voice can drug you?</i>

3
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,990
<i>That everything is so intense -</i>

4
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,037
<i>the colours,</i>

5
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,878
<i>the taste,</i>

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,956
<i>even the rain?</i>

7
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,833
<i>Nothing like the filthy rain in London.</i>

8
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,636
<i>They say whatever you're looking for</i>

9
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,320
<i>you will find here.</i>

10
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,271
<i>They say you come to Vietnam</i>

11
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,960
<i>and you understand a lot in a few minutes.</i>

12
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,835
<i>But the rest has got to be lived.</i>

13
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,190
<i>The smell,</i>
<i>that's the first thing that hits you -</i>

14
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,710
<i>promising everything</i>
<i>in exchange for your soul.</i>

15
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,149
<i>And the heat.</i>

16
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,475
<i>Your shirt is straight away a rag.</i>

17
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,239
<i>You can hardly remember your name,</i>

18
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,920
<i>or what you came to escape from.</i>

19
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,433
<i>But at night, there's a breeze.</i>

20
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,757
<i>The river is beautiful.</i>

21
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,031
<i>You could be forgiven for thinking</i>
<i>there was no war,</i>

22
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,469
<i>that the gunshots were fireworks,</i>

23
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,909
<i>that only pleasure matters.</i>

24
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,998
<i>A pipe of opium,</i>

25
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,635
<i>or the touch of a girl</i>
<i>who might tell you she loves you.</i>

26
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,114
<i>And then something happens,</i>

27
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,117
<i>as you knew it would,</i>

28
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,277
<i>and nothing can ever be the same again.</i>

29
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,876
Monsieur Fowler.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,991
Thank you for coming in.

31
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,680
I'm sorry to ask you at this hour.

32
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,030
I know about as much as you do.

33
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,991
He's an American. He's about 30.

34
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,111
He works for the Economic Aid Mission.

35
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,117
And I like him.

36
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,118
He's a very good chap. Serious.

37
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,836
Not like those noisy bastards
down at the Continental.

38
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,996
He's a quiet American.

39
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,908
Yes. A very quiet American.

40
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,474
He's dead, isn't he?

41
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,874
Not guilty.
I just put two and two together.

42
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,274
He was killed by a knife.

43
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,915
Can you identify him?

44
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,393
Yes.

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,833
He was... a friend.

46
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,198
To tell you the truth,
I'm not completely sorry.

47
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,278
These Americans are causing
a lot of trouble to us.

48
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,433
But still, a murder is a murder.

49
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,790
Anything to help us?

50
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,913
No.

51
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,031
Nothing at all.

52
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,398
Please.

53
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,151
Pyle...

54
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,837
<i>est mort.</i>

55
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,309
Assassinated.

56
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,351
How?

57
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,757
He was stabbed.

58
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,679
Yes.

59
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,634
He was in love with me.

60
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,594
Yes. He was.

61
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,551
I'm so sorry, Phuong.

62
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,634
I go to my mother's.

63
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,756
I must think.

64
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,716
<i>I met Pyle where you meet everybody -</i>

65
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,512
<i>at the Hotel Continental.</i>

66
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,359
<i>I'm there every morning at 11.00.</i>

67
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,632
<i>I'm English. I have habits. I drink tea.</i>

68
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,672
<i>I'm a reporter, so I listen.</i>

69
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,397
<i>I have a lover. I like to watch</i>
<i>her arrive at the milk bar.</i>

70
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,870
<i>And there was Alden Pyle.</i>

71
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,309
<i>A face with no history and no problems.</i>

72
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,317
<i>The face we all had once.</i>

73
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,510
- I'm Alden Pyle.
- I'm Thomas Fowler.

74
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,996
- The London Times.
- You've done your homework.

75
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,758
I've read your articles.

76
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,791
- May I join you?
- Please.

77
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,957
And what brings you to Saigon, Mr Pyle?

78
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,992
I'm with the Economic Aid Mission,
on the medical side.

79
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,636
Eye disease. Do know trachoma?
It's very common here. Very easy to treat.

80
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,469
- Are you staying at the hotel?
- No. I just dropped by for tea.

81
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,158
On the way to the office.

82
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,589
This is really a stroke of luck for me.

83
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,631
You're one of the few correspondents

84
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,718
who goes out into the field
to see what's happening.

85
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,470
Not any more. Besides, I have never
thought of myself as a correspondent.

86
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,319
I'm just a reporter.
I offer no point of view.

87
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,829
I take no action. I don't get involved.

88
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,678
I just report what I see.

89
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,679
- But you must have an opinion.
- Even an opinion is a form of action.

90
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,074
Still, I'd appreciate...

91
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,839
<i>Pyle was hungry for everything</i>
<i>I could tell him about Vietnam</i>

92
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,110
<i>and her fight for independence.</i>

93
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,879
<i>Why were the French losing the war?</i>

94
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,070
<i>And why were the communists winning?</i>

95
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,115
<i>Then he saw Phuong.</i>

96
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,596
<i>I should have realised how saving</i>
<i>a country and saving a woman</i>

97
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,314
<i>could be the same thing</i>
<i>to someone like Pyle.</i>

98
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,874
We've got to contain communism.

99
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,070
<i>What could be done,</i>
<i>what should be done,</i>

100
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,714
<i>what he thought, what he'd read.</i>

101
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,876
<i>He made me remember there was a time</i>

102
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,991
<i>when I had wanted to make a difference.</i>

103
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,157
- To watch liberty snuffed out?
- "Liberty" is a western word.

104
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,669
How do you define it
for the Vietnamese?

105
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,518
The freedom to choose.

106
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,553
OK, you give them that,
they vote and they elect Ho Chi Minh.

107
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,114
Things are more complicated
than they seem.

108
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,590
- What was that?
- A grenade.

109
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,470
- It sounded like a car backfiring.
- A week here, you'll know the difference.

110
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,795
It's been a genuine pleasure meeting you.

111
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,639
- Maybe we could eat dinner.
- I look forward to it.

112
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,159
Great.

113
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,554
Good morning.

114
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,158
Morning, Hinh. Anything new?

115
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,556
Oh, corruption, mendacity...

116
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,352
I said new.

117
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,232
There is a rumour
that the communists

118
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,272
are planning an attack
in the north, at Phat Diem.

119
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,470
One of your contacts?

120
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,471
Yes, sir.

121
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,309
And a telegram.

122
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,476
- From the London office.
- Mr Stemins.

123
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,149
He says the paper has conducted
a review of the foreign desk.

124
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,350
He wants you based in London.

125
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,909
Christ.

126
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,190
I thought you liked London, sir.

127
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,312
I do, but I like it just where it is.
I don't want to bloody go there.

128
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,556
For what? A desk job?

129
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,432
They probably think it's cheaper

130
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,869
to let the wire services cover Vietnam.

131
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,070
How many stories
have we given them?

132
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,838
This year?

133
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,235
- Yes.
- Three.

134
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,396
Oh, shit.

135
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,157
Maybe... I should go up there.

136
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,229
- Where, sir?
- Phat Diem.

137
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,478
It's not an easy place to get into,
with the communist attack.

138
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,478
Send a cable to Stemins.

139
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,512
Understand your current concern. Stop.

140
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,838
Am working on a story
of major proportions. Stop.

141
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,476
Suggest I remain in Saigon
until completed. Stop.

142
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,591
Fowler.

143
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,076
Which story is that, sir?

144
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,314
I don't know.

145
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,309
But I'm sure you know someone
who can get me in there.

146
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,593
Today our anniversary. Did you forget?

147
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,676
Can it be two years already?

148
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,439
- Yes.
- Yes?

149
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,030
Be careful with me. I'm old and fragile.

150
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,916
Not so old.

151
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,034
Not so fragile.

152
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,073
Tom!

153
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,636
Thomas.

154
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,830
- Hello.
- Hello again.

155
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,349
I'm here with some friends.
Care to join us?

156
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,472
- Phuong, this is Mr Pyle.
- Alden, please.

157
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,993
You know Joe Tunney,
from the American legation.

158
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,157
Yes, I know Joe.
Overthrown any small countries recently?

159
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,438
- Fowler sees conspiracies everywhere.
- That's for sure.

160
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,438
Is it true that the communists
are attacking Phat Diem?

161
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,916
How the fuck should I know?
We only report victories.

162
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,032
One of our medical teams wasn't
allowed past Phnom Penh.

163
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,630
- I was thinking of going up there.
- It's a Catholic town, isn't it?

164
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,389
- You got a date tonight?
- Bill...

165
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,317
She's got a date every night.

166
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,830
You got your piece of ass. I want mine.

167
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,909
Pyle, fellas, let's go to
the House of 500 Girls.

168
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,553
Oh, no thanks.

169
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,151
- I was planning on taking them to dinner.
- We've already booked at the Arc en Ciel.

170
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,477
That's great.
You go eat at the L'Arc en Ciel

171
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,750
and I'll get eaten next door.

172
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,838
Sounds like a plan. Come on, Bill.

173
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,394
Walk with me.

174
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,357
Seems like a nice young man.

175
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,837
- What does he do?
- Something with medical aid.

176
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,751
You go and get us a table and
I'll go and rescue our Mr Pyle.

177
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,549
Thank you.

178
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,678
I'm not staying. Just dropping him off.

179
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,068
Pyle! Let's get out of here.

180
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,749
Put your arm around this one.

181
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,872
If they think you've chosen one,
they'll let you go.

182
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,230
Put your arm around her.

183
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,555
- Night, Granger!
- Who wants the money most?

184
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,153
Miss Phuong, please forgive us
for keeping you waiting.

185
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,554
I forgive you.

186
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,195
- We had to make sure Bill got home.
- Home!

187
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,470
- Number 30?
- Sorry?

188
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,593
Tickets for the taxi dancers.
You buy a ticket for a dance.

189
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,713
Buy a ticket. Maybe I dance with you.

190
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,756
There you are.

191
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,272
Shall we?

192
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,877
Phuong is a very beautiful name.

193
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,432
It mean phoenix.

194
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,873
I thought it meant flower.
Like the ones in your hair.

195
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,275
Do you like my hair?

196
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,951
- This is traditional style.
- It's very nice.

197
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,833
- Do you know Vietnamese?
- Sure. Try me.

198
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,678
No. I don't...

199
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,756
I only know two words.

200
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,676
- Mr Fowler.
- Hello.

201
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,189
- May I?
- Of course.

202
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,151
Thanks.

203
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,953
Haven't seen you for a long time.

204
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,389
- I'm away a lot.
- Yes.

205
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,428
Who's he? Your friend?

206
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,358
His name is Pyle. He's with
the American Economic Mission.

207
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,948
He's from Boston. In America.

208
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,991
He's a very bad dancer.

209
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,599
Yes.

210
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:54,154
- He is married?
- Not that I know of, no.

211
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,713
This is Phuong's sister. Alden Pyle.

212
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,195
Very happy to meet you.

213
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,800
Your father is a business man?

214
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,989
No. He's a professor.

215
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,394
My sister is very good dancer, yes?

216
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,592
- She's too good for me.
- She's my only sister.

217
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,270
Your sister's a very pretty girl.

218
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,439
My sister is the most
beautiful girl in Saigon.

219
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,350
I don't doubt that at all.
Mr Fowler's a very lucky man.

220
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,754
My father was very sad
he had no grandchildren.

221
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,551
Would you like a drink?

222
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,432
No. Thank you.

223
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,120
My friends.

224
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,676
So pleased to have met you.
I hope we meet again soon.

225
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,712
- Perhaps you could arrange.
- When I get back from the north.

226
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,717
You are going north?

227
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,955
Yes.

228
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,991
Then you must come and have dinner

229
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,510
with me and my sister
when Mr Fowler is gone.

230
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,315
- To cheer her up.
- Thank you. I'd like that very much.

231
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,994
- What a nice woman.
- Absolute saint.

232
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,476
She used to work in office. Import-export.

233
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,795
- Really?
- She knows shorthand.

234
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,878
- Does she?
- Maybe you need someone.

235
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,833
Maybe we could work something out.

236
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,558
Please forgive me for dancing
with Miss Phuong so many times.

237
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,638
- I like watching her dance.
- She's a very good dancer.

238
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,638
She should be.
She used to do it for a living.

239
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,953
- What do you mean?
- She was a taxi dancer.

240
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,799
A hostess. Here at the Arc en Ciel.

241
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,109
I thought you said
she came from a good family.

242
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,756
She did, but the father died
so the sisters had to earn a living.

243
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,758
- Well, that's too bad.
- What?

244
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,678
Isn't that just a step up from
the girls across the street?

245
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,554
Good God, no. It took me six months
to get her to go on a date.

246
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,559
Grenade.

247
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,869
- So are you married?
- Yes, I am.

248
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,552
But not to her.

249
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,439
There's something I haven't told you.

250
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,712
I got a telegram from the paper,
asking me to go back to London.

251
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,756
So will you go?

252
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,751
I've cabled them,

253
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,713
asking them to let me stay, but...

254
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,674
if they stop paying me,

255
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,394
I'm not sure how we'll live.

256
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,955
I come with you to London.

257
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,716
I'd marry you if I could.

258
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,117
- You know that.
- Yes.

259
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,873
That's what I always tell my sister.

260
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,951
You think your wife will give divorce?

261
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,393
I doubt it.

262
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,758
<i>When did everything change?</i>

263
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,068
<i>Maybe there isn't one moment.</i>

264
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,558
<i>The cable from London calling me home?</i>

265
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,592
<i>Or watching them dancing together?</i>

266
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,951
<i>Or what followed between us,</i>
<i>she and I,</i>

267
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,230
<i>through the long night?</i>

268
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,636
<i>I was never brave.</i>

269
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,514
<i>But there I was, heading north,</i>

270
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,200
<i>the fear of losing Phuong more terrifying</i>

271
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,788
<i>than the fear of any bullet.</i>

272
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,273
The communists attacked four days ago.

273
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,994
We pushed them back only yesterday.

274
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,271
We think there is 300 in this village.

275
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,390
- But you will not see them.
- It's getting worse, isn't it?

276
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,829
How long can you keep going?

277
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,837
A few months, maybe.

278
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,430
My men are counting bullets.

279
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,669
No, no! Don't shoot!

280
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,278
What the hell are you doing here?

281
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,436
They wouldn't let my truck
out of Phnom Penh

282
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,028
so I figured I'd see
what was going on for myself.

283
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,679
You're lucky to get here alive.

284
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,957
It wasn't that hard after I hired a boat.
It wasn't expensive.

285
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,389
- In the end I just bought it.
- You are mad.

286
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,714
- I'm mad?
- Yes.

287
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,831
Have you ever seen anyone
with trachoma?

288
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,111
- Yes, I suppose I have.
- It's not that easy to remain uninvolved.

289
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,635
This way.

290
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,558
<i>"Not that easy to remain uninvolved. "</i>

291
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,158
<i>I had hidden for so long</i>
<i>behind a typewriter.</i>

292
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:01,159
<i>What we found there,</i>
<i>what we saw, in Phat Diem.</i>

293
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,589
<i>What did that do?</i>

294
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,919
<i>To his zeal, to my detachment?</i>

295
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,270
<i>The dead are not involved.</i>

296
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,880
<i>The dead have no zeal.</i>

297
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,798
<i>They are lying in wait.</i>

298
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,038
<i>You see them, all their tenderness,</i>

299
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,315
<i>and then they haunt you.</i>

300
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,355
- Communists?
- This is not the work of French soldiers.

301
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,794
It doesn't make sense.

302
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,957
The communists don't kill townspeople.

303
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,392
- It is not in their interest.
- Maybe another faction.

304
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,556
There are so many of them.

305
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,715
Each with their own army.

306
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,711
What's that book you're always reading?

307
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,434
York Harding.
<i>The Dangers To Democracy.</i>

308
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,074
- An American?
- Yeah.

309
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,509
He was out here a couple of years back.

310
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,029
- Was he here long?
- I don't know.

311
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,594
I heard him lecture once.
Joe actually met him.

312
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,518
He put forward the idea
of a third force to run Vietnam.

313
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,712
- Not the communists and not the French.
- Not the Americans?

314
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,070
No. We're not colonialists.

315
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,668
Something that could
really help these people.

316
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,110
- You have a gun, either of you?
- No.

317
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,674
They shall attack again tonight.

318
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,109
You don't want to be taken alive.

319
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,310
Believe me.

320
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,516
Shoot yourselves.

321
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,152
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

322
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,794
Stay inside that bunker.

323
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,912
- Do you want something to eat?
- No, thank you.

324
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,108
Come on.

325
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,993
You didn't come up
to check your medical team.

326
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,070
Joe Tunney sent you, right?
A little intelligence work.

327
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,591
I've never have been very good
at keeping secrets.

328
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,156
There is another reason
why I came up here.

329
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,312
- It's you.
- Me?

330
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,199
Yeah.

331
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,400
You said that you might be
coming up here.

332
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,192
The thing is, it's about Phuong.

333
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,753
Well, I guess it started
that night when we were

334
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,155
at the Arc en Ciel
and I was dancing with her.

335
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,274
I didn't think you ever got close enough.

336
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,710
And then I had dinner
with her and her sister

337
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,796
that Saturday and...

338
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,313
just when I was sitting there looking at her,

339
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,716
it all just became so clear to me.

340
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,990
I see.

341
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,350
Look, Tom, none of this was planned.

342
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,277
There's no way...

343
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,518
I never ever used to believe in
love at first sight.

344
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,429
But after seeing those other girls
in that awful place

345
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,109
and thinking that Phuong
could easily become one of them,

346
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,633
I want to protect her.

347
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,399
What did she say when you
offered her your protection?

348
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,636
- I haven't told her yet.
- You haven't?

349
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,877
No. I didn't think it would be right.
I wanted to speak with you first.

350
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,709
Look, if you two were married
that would be completely different.

351
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,035
I can never marry her. Oh, shit!

352
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,152
My wife would never give me a divorce.
She's a Catholic.

353
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,476
They're getting closer. They're walking in.

354
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,229
<i>Dear Thomas - I guess I'll be</i>
<i>back in Saigon ahead of you.</i>

355
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,796
<i>And I wanted to reassure you</i>

356
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,515
<i>that I won't go to see Phuong</i>
<i>until after you return.</i>

357
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,792
<i>If you can make the next transport out, you</i>
<i>should be back by the end of the week.</i>

358
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,037
<i>I can check in with your assistant</i>
<i>to see if you made it.</i>

359
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,119
<i>If so, I'll come around to see you</i>
<i>both together on Friday.</i>

360
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,151
<i>Say 5.00?</i>

361
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,912
Anyone due to go out to Hong Kong?

362
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,395
Someone from Reuters, I believe.

363
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,318
Type this up and ask him
to cable it to London for me.

364
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,317
- Your big story?
- Yes.

365
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,750
Massacre at Phat Diem.
Nobody did it, of course.

366
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,075
Not the French, not the communists...

367
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,717
But there are rumours.

368
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,360
- What's going on?
- I forgot.

369
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,630
- What?
- It's a rally.

370
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,911
- A new political party.
- Bloody hell.

371
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,749
I think I'd better leave your car here, sir.
We can walk.

372
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,516
- Isn't that Colonel Thé?
- General Thé.

373
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,517
- Who made him a general?
- He did.

374
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,837
He broke away from the French
and formed his own army.

375
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,956
- Hello.
- Hi.

376
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,836
You have a dog.

377
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,790
- Come in.
- Thanks.

378
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,557
- Where's Phuong?
- She's gone to see her sister.

379
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,871
- Would you like a whisky?
- Just a soda, thanks.

380
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,510
Does he have to do that?

381
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,269
Duke! Come here.

382
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,832
- You called him Duke.
- Yeah.

383
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,520
I found this guy in the street.

384
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,394
Didn't I? Who could turn
their back on a mug like that?

385
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,720
I saw you and Joe Tunney at the parade.

386
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,919
Did you go on to the rally?

387
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,510
Thanks. Yeah, I did.
It was really something else.

388
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,791
I thought only American politicians
went in for that nonsense.

389
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,797
All that was missing was the ticker tape.

390
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,514
They sure didn't forget the brass band.

391
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,311
Impressive guy, that General Thé.

392
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,000
It doesn't trouble you that
he's a complete egomaniac?

393
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,193
Look, I don't want to talk about
Phuong behind her back.

394
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,073
I thought she was going to be here, but...

395
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,715
- Her sister told me about her predicament.
- And what predicament is that?

396
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,151
I think you know.

397
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,157
You can't marry her,

398
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,193
and by living with you she can never have
a proper marriage to a Vietnamese man.

399
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,278
She doesn't need a proper marriage
with a Vietnamese man.

400
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,709
She's with me.

401
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,751
Here she is.

402
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,519
Hello, Phuong.

403
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,835
My sister is out.

404
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,434
- Hello.
- Hello. It's nice to see you.

405
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,599
It's you that Mr Pyle
has come to visit, Phuong.

406
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,517
So why don't we all sit down?

407
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,835
Unless, of course, you want me to leave.

408
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,837
No. That wouldn't be right.

409
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,031
We should sit down, then.

410
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,156
Fire away.

411
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:59,233
Ever since I met you
and danced with you and talked with you,

412
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,513
I haven't been able to get you out of
my thoughts for more than a moment.

413
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,996
I've fallen in love with you.

414
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,558
You fall in love with me?

415
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,275
Please believe me.
I've never behaved like this before.

416
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:29,269
I apologise. It is abrupt
and it is ill-mannered, but...

417
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,556
I'm in love with you.

418
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,156
Shouldn't you be on one knee?

419
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,953
Look... Phuong, I'm not a rich man

420
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,513
but I do have assets.

421
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,835
- Let's toss for her.
- What can you offer her?

422
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,555
- Oh, Christ.
- I don't expect you to love me right away.

423
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,955
You could always
make love to the chauffeur.

424
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,514
You have no right to insult her!

425
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,995
- Shut your bloody dog up.
- Come away with me.

426
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,998
Tell him to bugger off
and take his dog with him.

427
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,633
No.

428
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,114
Did you say no?

429
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,312
Yes. Sit down and have a scotch.

430
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,715
No. I should go. I'm so sorry.

431
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,354
- Do you want to smoke a pipe?
- A pipe?

432
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,357
Opium.

433
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,914
No. Why would I do that?

434
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,595
<i>I know before we married you warned me</i>

435
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,269
<i>beliefs meant that</i>
<i>there could never be a divorce.</i>

436
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,393
<i>All the same,</i>
<i>that's what I'm asking for now.</i>

437
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,796
<i>The fact is, I love someone very much.</i>

438
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,230
<i>I want you to feel affection</i>
<i>and act before you have time to think.</i>

439
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,239
<i>Just cable and tell me you agree.</i>

440
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,994
I've just asked my wife for a divorce.

441
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,916
Your sister...

442
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,112
Was she really out?

443
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,836
I told you.

444
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,033
I thought perhaps she sent you back

445
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,751
so that you could meet Pyle.

446
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,396
He's very young.

447
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,876
That's not so important.

448
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,314
Good news. They printed your story.

449
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,193
I got a cable from Stemins.
This got me a month's reprieve.

450
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,757
Page ten.
"French Break Communist Siege."

451
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,069
They didn't use much, did they?

452
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,634
Nothing here about
the villagers that were killed.

453
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,478
What did the French papers say?

454
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,831
Headlines blame it on the communists,
of course.

455
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,918
Well, a month is a month.

456
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,352
What else can you tell me
about this General Thé?

457
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,595
He's set himself up against both
the French and the communists.

458
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,317
Do you think he'd give me an interview
if I went up there?

459
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,158
Difficult to say.

460
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,590
Perhaps if he thought
he could get his message across.

461
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,280
The problem would be
getting it past the censor.

462
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,312
No, the real problem would be
to get close to the Cambodian border

463
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,873
and back before dark.

464
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,673
The communists control that road at night.

465
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,268
So many Europeans
have been killed out there.

466
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,640
I am Thomas Fowler of the London Times

467
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,550
and I'm here to interview General Thé.

468
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,798
I'm Thomas Fowler of the London Times.

469
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,595
I'm here to see General Thé.

470
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,228
<i>September, October, November...</i>

471
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,750
<i>I'd seen Pyle only once since</i>
<i>he'd asked Phuong to marry him,</i>

472
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,791
<i>at the Continental.</i>

473
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,759
<i>He'd been polite, of course -</i>

474
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,917
<i>how was I, how was Phuong?</i>

475
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,508
<i>He'd been busy, he said, out of the city,</i>

476
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,438
<i>working on his medical programme.</i>

477
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,358
<i>Though somehow,</i>
<i>I wasn't surprised to see him.</i>

478
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,268
<i>I was surprised to be pleased to see him.</i>

479
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,439
- What brings you out to these parts?
- I was hoping to interview the General.

480
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,313
But they've thrown me out of the place.

481
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,194
- What's your excuse this time?
- This is like a test run for us.

482
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,790
The French, in their typically French way,
have been very uncooperative

483
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:23,072
but General Thé has been good enough
to let us set up camp here.

484
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,396
I'll get them to let you in.

485
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,909
Joe Tunney's running aid programmes
with business people close to Thé.

486
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,996
- Mr Muoi.
- Mr Pyle.

487
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,276
- Hello. How are you?
- Good.

488
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,548
My name is Mr Muoi.
The General only has a few moments.

489
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,989
May I first ask you a question?

490
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,556
- Please.
- What is your relationship to the General?

491
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,240
I'm a businessman and a patriot.

492
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,512
Many of the supplies and aid you see
are the result of my efforts.

493
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,392
Shall we begin?

494
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,431
You say you've broken away from

495
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,473
the French and Vietnamese forces
with which you serve.

496
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,556
Do any ties remain?

497
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,636
The French are colonialists.

498
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,396
Not to be trusted.

499
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,795
It will take an independent
Vietnamese leader to rule our country.

500
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,117
How does the General expect
to launch a successful campaign

501
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,118
against the larger forces
of the communists and the French

502
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,310
with so few men and supplies?

503
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,513
And who is providing the means
for the General to achieve this?

504
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,350
Has he been fighting his war in the north?

505
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,952
There was a massacre at Phat Diem.

506
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,752
Were your forces present?

507
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,631
Regrettably the General has just recalled
that he has an urgent appointment.

508
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,796
- So, please.
- Thank you.

509
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,439
That was quick.

510
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,075
Things didn't go entirely according to plan.

511
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,839
Watch yourself with Joe.

512
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,793
I think he's up to something
with General Thé.

513
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,957
Can I get a ride to Saigon with you?
Something's wrong with my car.

514
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,957
Yes, of course you can.

515
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:23,358
Hello. Some kind soul
has had mine cleaned.

516
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,751
I heard a rumour
that you'd been recalled to London.

517
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,756
Really? Who told you that?

518
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,758
Phuong's sister.

519
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,993
- Shit.
- What is it?

520
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,634
We're out of petrol.

521
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,877
Some bugger up in the mountains
must have siphoned it off.

522
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,919
They might have some spare petrol
in that watchtower.

523
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,594
It looks like it's deserted.

524
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,711
I'll go in and have a look.

525
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,471
Hello?

526
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,111
- Is everything OK?
- Come up.

527
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,032
What are you thinking?

528
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,357
I was wondering
what she was doing right now.

529
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,318
This morning she met
her friends for elevenses

530
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,715
at La Fontaine.

531
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,069
Ice cream and the latest gossip.

532
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,158
On her way home
she stopped at the market

533
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,350
for fresh fish for dinner.

534
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:59,274
And now she's flipping through
the pages of magazines

535
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,712
Iooking at photographs of
the royal family and film stars,

536
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,231
listening to Bach's <i>Well-Tempered Clavier.</i>

537
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,149
I just got her started on Bach.

538
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,795
Have you had a lot of women, Thomas?

539
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,797
You start out by being promiscuous,

540
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,440
and end up like your grandfather -

541
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,118
faithful to one woman.

542
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:39,396
I know I'm not essential to Phuong.

543
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,799
But believe me when I tell you that

544
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,997
if I were to lose her,

545
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,036
for me...

546
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,234
it would be the beginning of death.

547
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,235
Somebody's had it.

548
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,669
There are 30 or 40 of these towers
between here and Saigon.

549
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,679
They only hit one or two a night
so our odds aren't too bad.

550
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,835
So what do you think they'd do
if the communists attacked?

551
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,793
These two? They'd fire a shot and run.

552
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,474
Why should they die for us? Or the French.

553
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,312
What's that?
I thought I saw something move.

554
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,756
Christ, they're here!

555
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,837
As far as I can make out,
he told them to give us up or else.

556
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,675
Stop! Give me that!

557
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,756
Come on, Thomas.

558
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,275
- What is it?
- I think I've twisted my ankle.

559
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,276
I'm gonna head up the road
to the next watchtower.

560
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,949
See if I can find a French patrol.

561
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,830
Sit tight, OK? I'll be back.

562
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:44,313
May I introduce myself? Thomas Fowler.

563
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,392
I found a patrol.

564
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,750
If I had died...

565
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,508
you could have had her.

566
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,518
And I think you should
inform your sources

567
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,553
that General Thé has a lot more men
than the hundred of their count.

568
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,399
He's a story we should take seriously.

569
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,829
Never underestimate a patriot, sir.

570
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,192
What do you know about Muoi?
Could he finance Thé's army?

571
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,515
He owns a bicycle factory!

572
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:44,668
Well, I think Joe Tunney
is plotting with he and Thé.

573
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,394
And it's more than
just foreign aid programmes.

574
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,159
I'll see what I can find out, sir.

575
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,791
Things are under control at the office.

576
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,275
- Try to get some rest.
- Thank you, Hinh.

577
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,349
I missed you.

578
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,153
- Are you all right?
- I'm all in one piece.

579
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,273
- You got a letter from London.
- Yes?

580
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,631
- I fetch it for you?
- No. Give me a kiss.

581
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,918
Big one.

582
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,199
I will get it.

583
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,991
You look afraid.

584
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,510
I think I'd better have a brandy and soda.

585
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,989
Pyle. Come in, come in.

586
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,549
Thought I'd drop by
and see how you were doing.

587
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,877
- Very well, thanks.
- How's the leg?

588
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,549
My tennis game will suffer,
but it wasn't much to begin with.

589
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,275
Thank you.

590
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,470
I'm glad you dropped by.

591
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,434
We have to thank Mr Pyle,
Phuong, for saving my life.

592
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,839
Thank you.

593
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,678
How's your sister doing?

594
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,518
- Sister?
- Yes.

595
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:07,235
Alden got her a job with Americans.

596
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,759
Oh, yes?

597
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,519
She likes it very much. Thank you.

598
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,835
Good. I'm very glad.

599
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,758
Since you're both here,
now is as good a time as any

600
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,112
to tell you that I have received
a letter from my wife

601
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,719
and she has more or less agreed
to give me a divorce.

602
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,069
That's wonderful.

603
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:41,633
- Come sit.
- Thank you. I've got plans.

604
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,557
Thank you for dropping by.

605
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,437
Bye.

606
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,432
Sir, I...

607
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,195
I trusted you, Thomas.

608
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,118
Always a mistake
when there's a woman involved.

609
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,151
Couldn't you have won without lying?

610
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,838
What is it, anyway?

611
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,474
My sister read the letter from your wife.

612
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,716
I show it to her

613
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:31,277
because... I was so proud.

614
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,472
- So happy.
- How could you treat her like this?

615
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,200
"Dear Thomas -
you always picked up women

616
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,436
like you picked up mud on your shoes."

617
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:46,028
I'm sorry, Phuong.

618
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,516
- So then why'd you lie to her?
- Because I wanted to keep her.

619
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,312
That's not love.

620
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,551
"Have you ever stopped to think how lonely
she'll be in England when you leave her?"

621
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,636
Shut up, for Christ's sake.

622
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,995
"I don't believe in divorce."

623
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:11,875
"My religion forbids it.
And so the answer is

624
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,433
no."

625
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,718
I was taught never to read
other people's letters.

626
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,957
- I was taught not to tell lies.
- Come on, Phuong.

627
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,836
I don't speak Vietnamese.

628
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,872
Get lost.

629
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,797
You were right about Muoi.
He does have connections.

630
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,150
Can we discuss this some other time?

631
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,033
Crates from overseas have been
moving through his factory,

632
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,230
bypassing French customs.

633
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,397
My sources have been unable
to determine what they contain.

634
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,788
He's probably got someone on the take.

635
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,391
He's an exporter, not an importer.

636
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,512
Yes, well, we'll do that tomorrow, OK?

637
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,108
No. A shipment just came in this afternoon.

638
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,435
It could be gone by the morning.

639
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,358
- What is this Diolacton?
- We must leave immediately.

640
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,038
- What are you doing?
- Trying to save your life. Go!

641
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:23,715
Good morning.

642
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,400
- Can I help you?
- You've done quite enough already.

643
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:32,159
- Where's Pyle?
- He's not in the office this morning.

644
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,999
- He does a lot of work at home.
- I know what he does at home.

645
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:38,795
- What do you mean?
- Ask her. She's fixed him up with my girl.

646
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,718
- We can't have scenes in the office.
- I know I am behaving badly.

647
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:44,195
But I have every intention
of behaving badly.

648
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:48,518
This is exactly the kind of situation
where one should behave badly.

649
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,438
- Could we please lower our voices?
- Why don't you bugger off?

650
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,357
Thomas, there is a lady here.

651
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,596
This lady and I know each other quite well.

652
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:58,917
She tried to get a rake-off from me,
but now she's getting one from Pyle.

653
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:02,350
- We have a lot of work to do.
- If Pyle phones, tell him I called.

654
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,278
It would be polite to return the visit.

655
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,393
How did he get in here?

656
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,958
This is Boston?

657
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:52,675
No, that's Niagara Falls. So is that.

658
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:57,158
This is Boston. That's Faneuil Hall.

659
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,875
I can't wait to take you to my country.

660
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,948
My friend from school.

661
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:19,270
She go to airport with her boyfriend.

662
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,231
He said he'd take her to France.

663
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,396
But in the airport,

664
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,479
he disappear, leave her there.

665
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:39,198
So many girls with French boyfriend,

666
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,033
no one to marry them.

667
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,471
Well, that'll never happen to you.

668
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,115
I promise.

669
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,919
- Hi.
- Have a nice Christmas?

670
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,110
One long party.

671
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,470
Did Phuong forget something?

672
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,909
Heard you came by the legation.

673
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,792
Yes.

674
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:29,639
- Who's this?
- Bodyguard. We all have them now.

675
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,955
Are you married yet?

676
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:34,958
No, I figured I'd wait until we got home
and do it properly.

677
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,594
You don't mind living here improperly?

678
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,509
It's hard to talk
if you're going to be so cynical.

679
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,234
I meant it'd be good to do it
with my parents there.

680
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,712
I had a cable from head office.
They want me back.

681
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:49,750
Oh, that's...

682
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,836
So it's good that Phuong went off with you.

683
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:56,078
She might have ended up as another
piece of arse for someone like Granger.

684
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,555
At least I know you'll treat her right.

685
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:03,310
So does this mean
that we can still be friends?

686
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,396
I don't see why not.

687
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:17,511
So what is Diolacton, anyway?

688
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,355
- You know about that?
- Shouldn't I?

689
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,438
Well... Diolacton is a milk-based plastic.

690
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:26,358
It's used for the frames in the eyeglasses.

691
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,233
Are you still in touch with General Thé?

692
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,514
- We keep the channels open.
- And Muoi?

693
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,995
Mr Muoi's helped
get our supplies through customs.

694
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:38,795
- The French have started to charge for...
- You asked me for advice once.

695
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:42,071
Here it is. Leave the bloody
third force to Joe,

696
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:45,829
forget York Harding,
and go home with Phuong.

697
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:52,312
And would you shut the door
on the way out, please?

698
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,670
Morning, Larry. What is it today?

699
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,109
You know,
some cockamamie assignment.

700
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:22,310
We should go. Joe Tunney said
to be out of here by ten to eleven.

701
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,510
- What is it, anyway?
- I'm not sure.

702
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,195
- Is it a demonstration?
- I don't know.

703
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,590
My friend is in there.

704
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,077
Did you cut your hand, sir?

705
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,276
Yes.

706
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,711
- How is it down there?
- 30 dead.

707
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,796
Probably 20 more by morning.

708
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:32,198
They've started arresting
communist sympathisers.

709
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:35,230
There was a woman.

710
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:38,111
With a baby.

711
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:45,113
She covered it with her hat.

712
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:01,152
This man... he died.

713
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,956
Right in front of his family.

714
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,432
Pyle...

715
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,919
Did you see him?

716
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,190
He spoke Vietnamese.

717
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:37,435
Like... like it was his,
you know, native language.

718
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,911
Murray! Come over here! Get this.

719
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,838
Move it. Right here. On this side.

720
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,474
Understand?
Go make yourself useful somewhere else.

721
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:13,149
<i>Diolacton is a milk-based plastic.</i>
<i>We used it for the frames.</i>

722
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,033
<i>- How many stories have we given them?</i>
<i>- This year?</i>

723
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,911
"Casein plastics."

724
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,553
"Made from milk protein."

725
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:29,878
<i>York Harding: "Dangers to Democracy. "</i>
<i>He put forward the idea of a third force...</i>

726
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,676
"Used in the manufacture
of imitation tortoiseshell and jade."

727
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,912
"Trade name: Diolacton."

728
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,748
"Also used as a plasticiser

729
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,516
in explosive compounds."

730
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:48,189
<i>Joe Tunney's running aid programmes</i>
<i>with business people close to Thé.</i>

731
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,673
Muoi.

732
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:52,874
And Thé.

733
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,515
<i>It will take an independent</i>
<i>Vietnamese leader to rule our country.</i>

734
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,870
<i>The Americans have been supplying them</i>

735
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:02,279
<i>with materials to make bombs.</i>

736
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,319
<i>Fowler sees conspiracies everywhere.</i>

737
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:12,514
I have some contacts who would
like to speak to your friend.

738
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,634
Joe Tunney?

739
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,515
Pyle?

740
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:24,915
They feel he can give them
important information about all this.

741
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:28,077
You're saying Pyle is OSS?

742
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,074
I believe the new name is the CIA.

743
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,072
- Anyone could speak to him.
- It's not so easy.

744
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,434
He's followed by protectors.

745
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:46,715
But if you asked to meet with him,
man to man,

746
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:50,075
he would come along.

747
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,909
These contacts. Are they communist?

748
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:02,238
Officially, no. Unofficially, yes.

749
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,191
I don't know.

750
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,834
Suppose you invite him to dinner
at the Vieux Moulin,

751
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:10,110
say between 9.00 and 9.30.

752
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,793
It's quiet near there.
My friends can speak to him undisturbed.

753
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:18,510
Maybe he's engaged.

754
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:24,878
At 6.30, my contacts will have someone
in the street outside your apartment.

755
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:30,236
All you have to do,
if you decide to invite him to dinner...

756
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:33,238
go to the window and open a book.

757
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,078
What will they do to him?

758
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:44,752
I promise you-my contacts will act
as gently as the situation allows.

759
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,036
Sooner or later, Mr Fowler,

760
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,912
one has to take sides

761
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,600
if one is to remain human.

762
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,953
<i>I need to speak to you about</i>
<i>what happened this morning</i>

763
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,831
<i>in the Place Garnier.</i>

764
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,229
- Phuong.
- A letter for you.

765
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,632
Thank you.

766
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:57,035
Just give me a few minutes, all right?

767
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,394
Come in.

768
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,351
I got your message.

769
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,357
So I see.

770
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:57,629
- I'd love a drink.
- I've only got hard liquor.

771
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:02,595
You're probably on duty. I've noticed
you're rarely off duty these days.

772
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,515
Whisky'd be fine. People change.

773
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:09,633
Or maybe they just never were
what we thought they were.

774
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,954
Who of us is, Thomas? Who of us is?

775
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,676
You want to talk about General Thé?

776
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,950
Yes. And Mr Muoi.

777
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,349
And Diolacton.

778
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:36,718
- We met with Thé this afternoon.
- He's in Saigon?

779
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,910
Come to see how his explosives worked?

780
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:42,157
His original target was a military parade.

781
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:44,316
We were pretty tough on him.

782
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:46,271
Did you tell him you wouldn't support him?

783
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:50,279
- We told him if he steps out of line again...
- He tried to kill you on the road to Saigon.

784
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,517
No. He tried to kill you.

785
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,635
You knew?

786
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,911
I suspected that he might try something.
Or one of his officers.

787
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,156
So I tagged along just in case.

788
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:05,840
You're a fool if you think
you can control General Thé.

789
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,235
In a war, you use the tools you've got.

790
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,635
Right now, he's the best we have.

791
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:13,752
And in the meantime,
even more people must die.

792
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,678
Last year the US government
gave $210 million

793
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,268
in military assistance
to the French in Indochina.

794
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:23,473
If we are going to stop communism
and underwrite a third way,

795
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,910
we need to give the people
a leader who they admire.

796
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,600
Tomorrow when Congress reads
the sees the photographs

797
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:33,110
of the communist atrocities,
they are going to give us that support.

798
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,037
The French won't stop the communists.

799
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:38,709
They haven't got the brains
and they haven't got the guts.

800
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,115
How did I fit into all this?

801
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,317
Am I part of your cover?

802
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,914
Or a source of information?

803
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:55,590
Or did you have your eye
on Phuong all the time?

804
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:59,474
You and Phuong? I never planned for
any of that to happen. Believe me.

805
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:03,070
It would have been easier
if I'd never met either one of you.

806
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:07,398
- But you did. And you lied to us.
- What do you want me to tell you?

807
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:11,516
That I took no action?
That I have no opinion?

808
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,239
Tell me that you don't mean any of this.

809
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:20,680
Tell me that you were only obeying orders.

810
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:24,315
Or tell me that after what you saw
in the square, those children,

811
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,237
who did nothing and hurt no one,

812
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:28,635
tell me that you were
so confused and horrified

813
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:32,150
at how brutal and insane
these actions are.

814
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:35,829
Tell me how your love for Phuong
has caused you to have some doubts.

815
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:39,669
But it's because of Phuong
that I am even more determined.

816
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:44,430
Let's just look at Phuong. There's beauty.
There's daughter of a professor.

817
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,154
Taxi dancer.
Mistress of an older European man.

818
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,748
That pretty well describes
the whole country.

819
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:53,793
Look, Thomas, we are here
to save Vietnam from all of that.

820
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:56,195
What happened in the square
makes me sick.

821
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,629
But in the long run, I'm going to save lives.

822
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:04,191
It's you, isn't it?

823
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,593
Joe Tunney, the staff at the legation,

824
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:10,188
Mr Muoi, General Thé.

825
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:14,437
They all take their fucking orders
from you, Pyle.

826
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:18,915
York Harding prattles on about a third
force in that book you carry around.

827
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:22,876
You've actually gone out and made one.

828
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:27,038
I don't think you see
the big picture, Thomas.

829
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:30,872
No, I do not see the big picture.

830
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:42,832
Do you know this poem?

831
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:46,475
"I walk down the street
and I don't give a damn

832
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,876
The people, they stare
and they ask who I am

833
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,231
And if by chance I should run over a cad

834
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,073
I can pay for the damage, if ever so bad."

835
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:03,228
We can disagree and remain friends,
can't we, Thomas?

836
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,593
Yes.

837
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,079
Look, I'm sorry.

838
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:15,829
Let's have dinner
and put all this mess behind us.

839
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:20,516
- 9.00, Vieux Moulin. OK?
- That sounds great.

840
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,238
I miss our conversations.

841
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,590
Vieux Moulin it is.

842
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:30,752
All right, then. I'll tell Phuong
she can have dinner with her sister.

843
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,277
I'll get her to meet me here afterwards.

844
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,999
Look, if you can't make it,
come straight here.

845
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,592
- I'll wait for you.
- All right.

846
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:48,234
I'll see you soon, Thomas.

847
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,996
Walk.

848
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,433
I need to talk to somebody
who speaks English.

849
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:48,473
You see, it's my son's birthday tonight.

850
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:58,479
We need to ask you some questions.

851
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:02,070
I'm from the American legation.
I just try and help people see.

852
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:07,959
The thing is, I...

853
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:11,356
I got a cable from my wife.

854
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:19,549
My boy has polio.
They don't know if he's going to make it.

855
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:24,832
I don't care if he's crippled.

856
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:27,110
I just don't want him to die.

857
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,789
I'm sorry. I've just got to get some air.

858
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:59,315
<i>At least 2,000 people were killed</i>
<i>and scores of others injured.</i>

859
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:01,590
<i>In the wake of last week's bomb blast</i>
<i>in Saigon,</i>

860
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,394
<i>French officials report...</i>

861
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,876
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

862
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,275
would you mind to come
downstairs with me?

863
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:20,835
- What do you want?
- I have something to show you.

864
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:26,679
It seems Monsieur Pyle came
to see you the night he died.

865
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:29,988
- So what, Vigot?
- You said he did not.

866
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,595
By the way, we found Pyle's dog.

867
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,950
They cut its throat.

868
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:44,071
You see here?

869
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:47,397
Pyle's dog had cement between its toes.

870
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:50,796
This was poured
on the afternoon of his murder.

871
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:52,876
So what does that prove?

872
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,272
And the patron of the Vieux Moulin told me

873
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:02,757
that night you asked for a table for one.

874
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:04,753
Not two.

875
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:09,077
I have nothing more to add
to my original statement.

876
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:13,673
Nothing?

877
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:20,676
You know I didn't kill him, Vigot.

878
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,355
There's a war on.

879
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:30,311
People are dying every day.

880
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:51,069
Ask another girl.

881
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:54,191
I don't want another girl.

882
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:27,157
Will you come back now, Phuong?

883
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,874
- Will you come back to me?
- To London?

884
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,514
No. Not to London.

885
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:37,955
Then I don't come back.

886
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,469
Please. I...

887
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:43,596
I can't take you to London.

888
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,749
Because I'm not going.

889
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:50,276
I'm not leaving you.

890
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,234
Never.

891
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,428
Will you come back to me?

892
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:40,191
- Will you take down my hair?
- Yes.

893
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:00,431
Do you miss him?

894
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,476
Yes.

895
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:12,352
I'm sorry.

896
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:17,154
Why are you sorry?

897
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,791
I don't know.

898
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:23,149
I just feel that...

899
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:26,317
I ought to apologise to... someone.

900
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:32,116
Not to me.

901
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,512
Never to me.

902
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,190
<i>They say you come to Vietnam</i>

903
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:48,915
<i>and understand a lot in a few minutes.</i>

904
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:53,352
<i>The rest has got to be lived.</i>

905
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:55,948
<i>They say whatever it was</i>
<i>you were looking for</i>

906
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:58,676
<i>you will find here.</i>

907
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:03,559
<i>They say there is a ghost in every house.</i>

908
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:06,794
<i>And if you can make peace with him,</i>

909
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:08,831
<i>he will stay quiet.</i>

910
