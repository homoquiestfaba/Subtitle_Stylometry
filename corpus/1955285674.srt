1
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,286
Esteemed citizens of Quartu,

2
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,844
I stand before you a proud Blarg,

3
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,845
for tonight, we will twist
the very fabric of reality.

4
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,686
We will defy nature with reckless abandon.

5
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,364
We have also broken 16 galactic
statutes and one star ordinance,

6
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,001
so I shouldn't see
anything about this online!

7
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,487
Beautifully worded, sir.

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,001
Hmm.

9
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,283
In just a few moments,

10
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,604
we will unleash a weapon
so powerful that it will take...

11
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,049
Stanley, are you seriously still
texting after what I just said?

12
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,442
Victor? If you please.

13
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,888
Uh...

14
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,201
Mommy.

15
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,129
Dialing Mother.

16
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,125
Hello, Horkelberg residence!

17
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,645
Hello? Who is this?

18
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,725
Herman, it's that man again.
I hear heavy breathing and...

19
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,485
Ew! And chewing!

20
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,846
That's it. I'm calling the police.

21
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,244
Does anyone else feel like texting? Hmm?

22
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,526
Show of hands?

23
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,809
- Anyone?
- Uh-uh.

24
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,645
Very well.

25
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,041
Commence deplanetization!

26
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,967
Ready the Deplanetizer!

27
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,881
Seriously?

28
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,521
496, 497, 498, 499, 500.

29
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,523
Come on. Is that all you got?

30
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,968
I need you to give me 2,000,010%.

31
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,560
One and two and three and four.

32
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,285
Remember, if you feel
the burn, that's good.

33
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,488
If you smell the burn, that's bad.

34
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,962
Three, two, one.

35
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,881
Okay, let's dig deep.

36
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,325
Don't quit on me now.

37
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,725
Can you feel it? Huh? Huh?

38
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,723
Can you feel the burn?

39
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,801
Are you kidding? I'm on fire.

40
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,005
I can take anything you can dish out,
so bring it on!

41
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,809
Okay, 2,000 more.

42
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,084
2,000?

43
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,925
One and two, three and four.

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,128
No pain, no gain.

45
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,165
And we'll be right back
after these messages!

46
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,085
Okay, bots! Let's do this!

47
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,242
And lunge! And lunge!

48
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,085
Ranger Workout will be right back!

49
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,400
Burn!

50
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,926
Planet Tenemule is no more.

51
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,241
What?

52
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,203
Hello. Dallas Wannamaker here.

53
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,285
Tonight at 5:00, another uninhabited planet
is destroyed without warning or cause,

54
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,604
marking the fourth in recent memory
of our once-peaceful galaxy.

55
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,245
As a result, the President has requested

56
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,484
our ever-vigilant Galactic Rangers
increase their numbers

57
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,688
from four to five.

58
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,680
Really? Just five? All right.

59
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,721
And now a message from the man himself,
Captain Qwark.

60
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,643
Space, a wondrous realm
full of adventure, and peril,

61
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,008
and, uh, big-ness.

62
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,406
Captain Qwark!

63
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,569
The Solana Galaxy is our home,
and as many of you know,

64
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,805
it's in a state of crisis.

65
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,404
The Galactic Rangers are looking for a new
recruit to help with the investigation.

66
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,563
So if you're a small-time nobody
in search of adventure,

67
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,725
come on down to the spaceport
and see me, Captain Qwark!

68
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,165
- Cue montage!
- Cue montage!

69
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,167
Our next stop,
Planet Veldin's Kyzil Plateau!

70
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,125
Kyzil Plateau?

71
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,326
That's right!

72
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,410
The Kyzil Plateau!

73
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,164
Ranger tryouts.

74
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,890
This is huge.

75
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,001
Galactic Ranger! Grab some sky.

76
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,447
Galactic Ranger, punk. Put 'em...

77
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,601
Whoa!

78
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,285
Ranger down!

79
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,604
Mission accomplished.

80
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,691
Hello?

81
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,522
I'm here to pick up my ship?

82
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,081
I'll be there in one minute.

83
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,521
Ah!

84
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,965
Give or take.

85
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,281
Hello? Hello?

86
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,965
Hello?

87
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,801
Hmm?

88
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,971
Are you ready to have your mind blown?

89
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,730
Eh. No.

90
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,241
Whoo-ho-ho! Yeah!

91
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,803
I'll take that as a yes.

92
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,405
Boom!

93
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,325
Protolux afterburners,
full Gadgetron weapon package,

94
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,562
and a high-intensity
mag-booster so powerful,

95
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,405
it can pick up a paperclip
from two kilocubits away.

96
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,403
I think there's been a mistake.

97
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,085
I came in to get my ejector seat repaired.

98
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,242
Why repair something
when you can improve it?

99
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,288
Come on, have a seat.

100
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,723
Now, let's fire up that mag-booster!

101
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,965
- Oh!
- Pretty sweet, right?

102
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,645
I guess, but why do I need it?

103
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,925
Well, you could...

104
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,843
I mean, you know, if you ever...

105
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,161
You know, I don't know.

106
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,241
Whoa!

107
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,685
No worries, I can buff that out.

108
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,525
Maybe we should just...

109
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,329
Power this sucker down.

110
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,322
Oh, boy.

111
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,402
Look out! Hello! Watch it!

112
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,605
Hey, I've been looking for that.

113
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,681
Greetings, Cadet!

114
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,085
- What was that sound?
- Nothing.

115
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,323
- Unrelated question, is your seatbelt on?
- Uh...

116
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,370
Hit the brakes! Hit the brakes!

117
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,287
Those aren't the brakes!

118
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,603
I'm too old to die!

119
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,125
You've got to be kidding me.

120
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,725
How did you get a license?

121
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,805
Whoa!

122
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,564
Can you hit the kill switch, please?

123
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,681
The fish witch?

124
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,000
The kill switch!

125
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,244
- Eh...
- On the dash!

126
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,807
The drill hatch on the dish!

127
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,084
Hang on, I can fix this.

128
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,483
Your tail's in my face!

129
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,483
Hey, the view's no prettier
down here, pal!

130
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,845
There's a wall!

131
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,967
Oh, boy.

132
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,081
Yes!

133
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,281
Whoa!

134
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,681
Phew!

135
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,603
That was a close one, huh?

136
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,923
I want a refund!

137
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,604
Yeah, that is going to
show up on my midyear review.

138
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,283
You seem especially brooding today, Victor.

139
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,608
Come! I have just the thing
to brighten your day!

140
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,282
Our next target!

141
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,203
Look at these waterfalls, the fjords,

142
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,126
the rolling hills of Corvoxian snodgrass!

143
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,565
This is exactly what I need.

144
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,921
But, sir, that entire region is heavily
patrolled by the Galactic Rangers!

145
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,811
We will have this planet!

146
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,608
And we will take it
by going on the offensive.

147
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,325
Our forces will strike
at the Galactic Rangers first

148
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,604
and remove them
from the equation altogether.

149
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,160
Wait. Real battle?

150
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,762
Metal hand against hand.

151
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,524
I trust this pleases you?

152
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,685
Of course it pleases me,
but we don't have any forces!

153
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,842
You let me worry about that.

154
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,681
In two days' time,
the Galactic Rangers will be destroyed

155
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,207
and I'll be able to
complete my masterpiece!

156
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,605
How many times, Ratchet? How many?

157
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,205
Come on, he's fine!

158
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,964
He landed in a pile of ivy.

159
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,041
Poison ivy.

160
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,689
Look, you're a great mechanic, you got
a lot of heart, but you're careless.

161
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,405
"Careless," it's such an ugly word.

162
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,528
I prefer "carefree."

163
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,362
Too soon? Yeah, it was too soon.

164
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,121
I know things haven't been easy for you,

165
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,044
but you can't keep acting out
like this when I have a shop to run.

166
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,204
What's with you lately?

167
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,121
I just feel like I'm supposed to do more.

168
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,202
I've always dreamt
of being a Galactic Ranger,

169
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,328
doing big things, like Captain Qwark!

170
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,321
You want an old mechanic's advice?

171
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,162
Dream smaller.
It leads to less disappointment.

172
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,325
Please, Grim.

173
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,643
I just need one hour off so I can go
to the spaceport for tryouts.

174
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,806
You promised you'd help me give proton
scrubs to every ship on the plateau!

175
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,165
It's almost summer.
These people depend on us!

176
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,445
First off, it's always summer.
We live in a desert.

177
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,921
And second, that promise
is still in effect!

178
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,403
It's a 100% valid promise,
and you can redeem it in one hour.

179
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,211
Yes! You! You are a great friend, Grim.

180
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,004
Don't let anyone tell you different.

181
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,051
I'll be back before you know it!

182
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,845
You're the best boss in the galaxy!

183
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,764
An inspiration to us all!
Don't ever change!

184
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,484
I'm okay!

185
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,969
Ladies and gentlemen,

186
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,205
get on your feet, put your hands together,

187
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,443
and give a big Planet Veldin welcome

188
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,286
to your Galactic Rangers!

189
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,125
First up, she'll shoot first and ask
questions when she's good and ready.

190
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,604
Cora Veralux!

191
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,487
You loved him in Grapplemania,
you'll love him more as a Galactic Ranger.

192
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:03,683
Get ready to feel the pain
of Brax "The Brute" Lectrus!

193
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,204
Yeah, baby!

194
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,245
And finally,

195
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,242
ladies and gentlemen,
the savior of Solana,

196
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,246
Captain Qwark!

197
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,085
Hello, Veldin!

198
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,650
Hello, Captain!

199
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,165
He's on fire again.

200
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,287
I know.

201
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,567
My name is Copernicus Qwark, and yes,

202
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,089
that was an impressive wall
of fire I just walked past.

203
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,445
I'm going to be real
with you folks for a moment.

204
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,603
When President Phyronix
recommended I take on a new ranger,

205
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,485
I knew just where to go.

206
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,245
That's right, we want you!

207
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,521
Yeah!

208
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,682
The galaxy is a perilous place.

209
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,805
Invasion, space pirates, supernovas!

210
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,203
I know what you're thinking,
"Do I have what it takes?"

211
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,125
After all, you may not have
prevented Dr. Nefarious

212
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,884
from atomizing Aleero City.

213
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,961
You may not have stopped Neftin Prog

214
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,362
from rendering the entire population
of Aridia color-blind!

215
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,161
Twice!

216
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,963
After all, you may not have this
chiseled jaw or godlike pectoral region,

217
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,170
but if you have heart,
then you have what it takes.

218
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,965
You don't have what it takes.

219
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,724
But I have heart.

220
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,320
Yes, but unfortunately
that heart is encased

221
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,165
in a weak, muscleless
mass of inexperience.

222
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,561
Plus, there's your history to consider.

223
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,085
You got a long line of citations here.

224
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,925
Possession of an illegal
gravity repulsor...

225
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,005
Oh, that was a misunderstanding.

226
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,889
I thought that space pirate
was on the level!

227
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,765
Operation of a black-market accelerator.

228
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,444
"Operation" is a strong word.

229
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,249
It blew up as soon as I turned it on!

230
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,767
Willful disruption
of the space-time continuum?

231
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,005
That is a funny story.

232
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,607
You're reckless, you're a loose cannon,
and you're dangerous.

233
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,888
That's my shtick.

234
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,004
Wait! Just give me a chance!

235
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,082
Sorry, no time! Galaxy in jeopardy!

236
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,091
Get back out there, and remember,
you can do anything...

237
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,921
As long as you're me. Next!

238
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,805
I have no less than three lethal katas

239
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,008
I would like to demonstrate for you today.

240
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,770
Get me out of these tiny blue-neck towns.

241
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,808
Dr. Nefarious!

242
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,445
The mad scientist who made
all of this possible!

243
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,126
"Mad" suggests cognitive impairment.

244
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,530
I'm more of a vengeful scientist.

245
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,805
I trust you're here to meet the troops.

246
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,800
Three hundred sentient warbots,

247
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,885
built using the finest raritanium
in the galaxy,

248
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,885
and programmed to assassinate
the Galactic Rangers.

249
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,725
Proton-powered, rust-proof,
and laser-guided.

250
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,723
Each of these perfect creations

251
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,085
is an efficient,
remorseless killing machine.

252
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,401
Remorseless killing machine...

253
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,767
Makes me want to have children of my own.

254
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,481
But will they get the job done?

255
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,685
I'd hate to have to send you
back where I found you.

256
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,245
State your prime objective.

257
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,005
Prime objective, destroy Galactic Rangers.

258
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,006
Inspection complete. Weapon issued.

259
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,920
My warbots know every offensive
tactic in the Ranger handbook.

260
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,765
They won't just kill the Rangers...

261
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,046
Target acquired.

262
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,244
They'll annihilate them!

263
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,520
Nice. They killed the lights, too.

264
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,247
Burn.

265
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,444
Repairbot!

266
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,684
- Ah!
- Now we're talking.

267
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,290
Target acquired.

268
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,686
Oh, my...

269
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,885
State your prime objective.

270
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,564
Destroy Galactic Rangers.

271
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,730
State your prime objective.

272
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,524
Destroy Galactic Rangers.

273
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,211
State your prime...

274
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,761
Hmm...

275
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,601
Hello.

276
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,845
Defect detected.

277
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,481
Preparing for immediate
destruction in three, two...

278
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,561
Hey! Wait!

279
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,365
Oh, a defect!

280
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,408
Go play, Victor.

281
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,001
No...

282
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,325
Ahh!

283
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,602
I'm coming for you, defect!

284
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,565
Oh! Ooh!

285
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,561
Hmm.

286
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,240
Defect!

287
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,604
Computer, set coordinates
for the Galactic Ranger home base.

288
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,920
Destination set.

289
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,651
We will never make it, but,
hey, what are you gonna do?

290
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,806
Oh, dear.

291
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,369
Sayonara, amigo.

292
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,161
Ratchet...

293
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,687
So, you're off to save the galaxy.

294
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,648
Turns out you were right.
I should dream smaller.

295
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,048
I'll never be a Ranger.

296
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,761
What?

297
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,921
Whoa!

298
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,402
Danger detected. Danger detected.

299
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,402
I told you we'd never make it,
but did you listen to me? No.

300
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,726
Hello?

301
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,405
Anyone in there? Whoa!

302
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,361
Prepare for imminent death.

303
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,727
There's got to be
a better way to say that.

304
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,321
Sorry.

305
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,080
Prepare for imminent death. How's that?

306
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,881
Five, four, three, two, one...

307
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,682
No vector shell damage.
Sister board appears to be intact.

308
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,805
Ah!

309
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,530
I must get to Aleero City!

310
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,601
They are in danger!

311
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,965
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Hey, who's in danger?

312
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,122
An army is coming. I must warn them!

313
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,010
Hang on, slow down.
You've been in a crash.

314
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,848
What do you say we get you
back to my garage?

315
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,691
I'll run a diagnostic
and have you fixed up in no time.

316
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,001
Thank you. I appreciate the assistance.

317
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,327
It's no problem. So what do I call you?

318
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,804
I suppose my proper designation
is Warbot Defect B5429...

319
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,120
Maybe I'll just call you Clank.

320
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,726
My name's Ratchet.

321
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,721
Uh...

322
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,803
Up and down.

323
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,161
Yeah, there you go. You're a natural.

324
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,089
Okay, that's enough.

325
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,802
Or just keep shaking. That's cool, too.

326
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,285
Almost got it.

327
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,283
And... There!

328
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,847
How do you feel?

329
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,487
Fully operational.

330
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,647
Sweet.

331
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,726
So, what are you doing
all the way out here in the sticks?

332
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,207
I am on a mission of galactic importance.

333
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,850
"Galactic importance"?

334
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,084
Okay. Oh, boy.
You must have ruptured your CPU.

335
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,525
How many fingers am I holding up?

336
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,526
Uh... Two. But I fail to see
the relevance of the question.

337
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,891
Chairman Drek has
built an army of warbots.

338
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,203
They're going to assassinate
the Galactic Rangers tomorrow.

339
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,005
Oh! That kind of galactic importance!

340
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,367
Well, why didn't you say so?
I can totally help!

341
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,601
Oh, I could not ask a civilian to get
involved in something so dangerous.

342
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,885
Well... No, I'm not just a civilian.

343
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,607
The Rangers are actually my friends!

344
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,123
Why do you think I have
so many pictures of them?

345
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,362
But why are you not in any of them?

346
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,841
Well, someone had to
take the picture, right?

347
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,888
I mean, come on. I even have a ship.

348
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,129
It disassembles so it can
infiltrate enemy strongholds.

349
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,241
So, what do you say?

350
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,601
I understand what the President wants,

351
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,446
but what are the odds of actually finding
a qualified Ranger way out in the boonies?

352
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,925
After all, there's nothing
the three of us can't handle...

353
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,045
Oh!

354
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,771
I am your biggest fan.

355
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,084
It's touching me. Get it off. Get it off!

356
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,725
Move it! Move it! We've got hostiles!
We've got hostiles!

357
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,801
Go! Go! Go!

358
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,441
Enemy warship! Take cover, citizen!

359
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,161
I love you!

360
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,811
Target acquired.

361
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,961
Hmm...

362
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,881
Hmm.

363
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,407
Hmm?

364
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,204
- What?
- Apologies.

365
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,807
I have not been able to locate
your species in my database.

366
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,365
I get that a lot.
There aren't many of us left.

367
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,010
Not in this galaxy, anyway.

368
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,846
I'm a Lombax.

369
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,485
A Lombax?

370
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,281
Fascinating.

371
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,565
Yeah. I crashed on Veldin
when I was just a baby.

372
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,006
No note, no message, no name...

373
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,370
Kinda like you.

374
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,484
Approaching destination.

375
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,765
Whoa!

376
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,245
Aleero City!

377
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,641
Yes, it certainly is.

378
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,405
No way!

379
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,691
It is the invasion. We are too late.

380
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,361
Target acquired.

381
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,411
You knocked on the wrong door, hombre.

382
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,525
How was that? Did that sound cool?

383
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,886
Oh, boy.

384
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,767
Target...

385
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,405
Target acquired.

386
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,406
Target...

387
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,247
Target...

388
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,723
- Brax to the max!
- Max!

389
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,561
Awesome!

390
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,281
Fire!

391
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,242
Bring me the captain's head,
or I'll take yours as a replacement.

392
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,846
Wilhelm!

393
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,246
I got these guys.

394
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,609
Welcome to the Hall of Heroes...

395
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,287
Oops. I must've forgotten
to install the targeting software.

396
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,925
Here, take the controls for a sec.

397
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,125
Oh. I... Um...

398
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,682
Ow! Hey! What's going on up there?

399
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,081
Well, unfortunately
my piloting skills are,

400
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,083
shall we say, slightly underdeveloped.

401
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,925
Yeah, I think we can
definitely agree on that.

402
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,201
- Whoa!
- You maniac!

403
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,362
Ratchet, we are clearly
not prepared for this.

404
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,405
We should have contacted the Rangers
to warn them of the attack.

405
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,045
Yeah, like they'd know who we are.

406
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,884
But you said they were your friends.

407
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,885
What?

408
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,122
I think you're quoting me out of context.

409
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,161
The Rangers are actually my friends!

410
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,408
Do you record everything I say?

411
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,648
Do you record everything I say?

412
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,283
We're going down!

413
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,320
Your sense of direction is impeccable.

414
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,121
I can fix this!

415
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,286
That was awesome!

416
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,007
Finish them!

417
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,605
Ratchet, I believe I may have an idea.

418
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,160
Your weapon package
includes a mag-booster.

419
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,046
I am rewriting the software to isolate the
raritanium alloy used to manufacture us.

420
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,321
Great idea, Clank!

421
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,125
Bring it on!

422
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,201
There's too many of them!

423
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,362
Hold steady, Rangers!

424
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,085
Prepare to die, Galactic losers!

425
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,366
Come on, come on!

426
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,723
Executing command, and engage mag-booster.

427
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,881
Is it working?

428
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,241
Oh!

429
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,210
I do believe it is.

430
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,730
Target acquired.

431
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,201
Huh?

432
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,361
No way.

433
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,090
- Yeah!
- Oh, yes.

434
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,805
You're getting this, right?

435
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,645
Two civilians are saving the city!

436
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,485
There are 300 heavily
armed warbots gaining on us!

437
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,164
I know! Isn't it great?

438
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,364
Get ready to return to sender!

439
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,044
Terminating mag-booster on my mark!

440
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,805
Three, two, one...

441
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,366
Mark!

442
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,205
No, no...

443
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,884
No!

444
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,761
What happened?

445
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,451
You got to be kidding me!

446
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,245
Get out.

447
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,731
Taxi!

448
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,124
Ah!

449
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,121
Hmm?

450
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,641
All right, everyone, let's give
these heroes some breathing room.

451
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,963
I'm happy to field all questions
on their behalf.

452
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,051
Captain Qwark!
Juanita Alvaro, HoloVid Nightly.

453
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,084
The Blarg have been underground
for over 50 years.

454
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,640
Could their return be linked
to the destroyed planets?

455
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,685
I think that's being a little alarmist,
don't you, Juanita?

456
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,843
Begging your pardon, Captain,
but Drek is responsible.

457
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,521
And his attack today proves
that he is only getting started.

458
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,965
Now, now! We must all stay calm.
Everything is under control.

459
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,804
Captain Qwark! Dallas Wannamaker here.

460
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,924
Does that mean you'll be asking
these two heroes to join the Rangers?

461
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,650
Say what now?

462
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,165
Well, I...

463
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,564
I... Well, I...

464
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,966
I don't see why not.

465
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,730
You heard it here, folks!

466
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,686
The search for a new
Galactic Ranger is over!

467
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,165
Aleero City will never forget
the day it was saved by a...

468
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,890
A cat thingy.

469
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,568
How did this happen?

470
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,805
Someone explain it to me! You!

471
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,281
You're supposed to
understand how they think!

472
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,044
How did you not see this coming?

473
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,844
And Victor!

474
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,445
Do you know how many candidates
you beat out for your position?

475
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,645
I could have hired the Zeezils Brothers!

476
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,849
It's enough to make me
want to vaporize someone!

477
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,525
We're putting our project on hold.

478
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,205
I'm ordering all remaining warbots to the
Deplanetizer until the heat dies down.

479
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,245
Before we make any rash decisions,

480
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,370
I wonder if you'd permit me
to troubleshoot this for you.

481
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,845
Go on.

482
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,570
Our question is simple.

483
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,808
How do you destroy a team of heroes?

484
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,845
Whoa! Whoa! Well, lots of ways, really.

485
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,481
Chains, knives, guns, an enormous rock?

486
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,841
Rock...

487
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,125
The answer is "from within!"

488
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,885
If we continue to fight them with muscle,
we'll lose every time.

489
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,567
But if we turn one of
their own against them...

490
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,441
Of course, we'd need a weak link.

491
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,405
A sad simpleton who'd believe
whatever we tell him.

492
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,847
A corruptible moron.

493
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,685
But who?

494
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,126
Who?

495
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,286
Who?

496
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,121
Hmm.

497
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,201
Ah!

498
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,725
I'm getting an idea, boys!

499
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,484
You're a genius, sir.

500
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,211
I know. I know!

501
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,004
Our training program
usually lasts a full year,

502
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,562
but we've been cleared to attack
Drek Industries in three days.

503
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,122
That means you two are getting
the accelerated course.

504
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,725
We're going to be trained by Brax Lectrus?

505
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,365
The guy's a legend!

506
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,565
I do not suppose you offer
introductory courses in aviation?

507
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,285
- No offense, little guy...
- "To the max!"

508
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,283
...but I don't think
flying's really your thing.

509
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,364
Captain Qwark suggested we put you
in a position a little less...

510
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,841
Dangerous?

511
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,161
Whoa!

512
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,805
Ha! That's right, LivesAtHome472.

513
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,451
What's the matter?
Don't like getting your butt kicked?

514
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,325
What are you going to do,
cry to your mommy?

515
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,602
Wait, are you really crying?

516
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,681
Hey, Elaris.

517
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,765
Hi, Brax! Is that my new assistant?

518
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,446
Greetings. Your office is most, uh...

519
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,481
Impressive.

520
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:17,485
Elaris here is in charge of developing
our gear and providing tactical support.

521
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,685
Usually it's the former.

522
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,325
The Rangers are
the shoot-first-think-later type.

523
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,448
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to sound like that.

524
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,201
Like what now?

525
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,045
Come on. I'll show you around.

526
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,201
Let's go, Cadet.
Time to make you a Ranger.

527
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,281
So, this is the...

528
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,121
Got to keep an eye on them.
Oh. And over here, over here...

529
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,281
I'll see you in a bit!

530
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,049
We're going to have so much fun!

531
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,285
Well, good luck.

532
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,164
Welcome, Cadet!

533
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,527
Let's get you into your new protosuit.

534
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,362
Your protosuit is the most advanced
combat armor on the market.

535
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,245
And it comes in
all the latest fall colors!

536
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,685
Sweet.

537
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,001
A neural sensor in your helmet
reads your thoughts

538
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,845
and telequips the desired
weapon into your hands.

539
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,968
Try equipping your Combuster.

540
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,325
There you go.

541
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,243
Combuster equipped.

542
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,525
Wicked.

543
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,165
The Combuster is the backbone
of the Rangers' arsenal,

544
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,050
allowing you to hit targets
in a short to medium range.

545
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,204
Whoa!

546
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,485
This is embarrassing.

547
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,643
The Alpha Disruptor
fires a deadly stream of plasma,

548
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,882
allowing you to hit
multiple targets at once.

549
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,648
- Whoa!
- See? He's got it.

550
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,001
Sort of.

551
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,681
This little baby's the Negotiator.

552
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,650
Fires multiple long-range,
high-impact rockets.

553
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,530
Great versus heavy armor.

554
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,880
Buzz Blades!

555
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,610
Hey, hey, hey! No, no, no!

556
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,721
Whoa!

557
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,290
The Warmonger.

558
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,281
Ah!

559
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,121
I dunno. The Spiral of Death?

560
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,165
Whoa!

561
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,201
Fusion Grenade?

562
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,005
- Wow.
- Dude.

563
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,491
How am I doing?

564
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,522
So this is really your office?

565
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,324
Eh. Budget cutbacks.

566
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,285
I don't mind it as much as
the last guy who had this job.

567
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,085
Dr. Nefarious.

568
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,445
Drove him crazy.

569
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,805
Literally. He turned evil.

570
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,963
Oh. But don't worry.
It won't happen to me.

571
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,961
Hmm.

572
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,725
That's strange.

573
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,925
What is it?

574
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,965
I'm running a simulation

575
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,765
based on the fragments we located
from each destroyed planet.

576
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,365
Each one is missing a famous landmass.

577
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,046
Well, perhaps the pieces
are still out there.

578
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,401
There is a lot of space in space.

579
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,641
I guess.

580
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,245
But it's worth bringing up to the captain,
don't you think?

581
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,321
- Out of the way!
- Hey!

582
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,724
Watch out! Heads up!

583
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,201
Coming through!

584
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,481
Whoa!

585
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,482
Just relax! Everyone, stay calm!

586
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,449
Something epic is happening!

587
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,125
Pretty cool, huh, Clank?

588
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,645
That's the stuff.

589
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,643
Flying in the air like a majestic bird,

590
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,044
a majestic bird who knows
every fighting style.

591
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,929
Watch the master.

592
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,325
Captain, Elaris and I...

593
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,965
- Can't talk.
- ...have some information.

594
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,644
Doing a flyby.

595
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,006
Sir! If you could come down and speak
to us for three minutes...

596
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,242
And there are the sprinklers.

597
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,805
But, hey, good news!

598
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,008
You already have a mop, huh?

599
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,730
So, there's that.

600
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,885
Please! If we could have just a minute
to discuss our findings.

601
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,725
The only thing I'm interested in finding
is the Hall of Heroes cafeteria.

602
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,044
Let's go, Cadet. It's three floors up
and it's meatloaf day!

603
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,005
Meatloaf!

604
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,767
Do they always treat you so poorly?

605
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,484
Oh! No!

606
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,411
Yes.

607
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,765
The new Galactic
Ranger Ratchet action figure!

608
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,125
There he is!

609
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,361
Guys, it's Ratchet!

610
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,845
Hey-hey!

611
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,684
Ratchet, we love you!

612
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,445
Boy, for a big city,
the people here sure are friendly.

613
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,727
And rather loud. Oh!

614
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,001
Sorry! Thought you were a trash can!

615
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,760
Indeed.

616
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,570
Wow. Look at that.

617
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,042
What do you know, Clank? I'm famous.

618
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,841
Yes. Though I am sure it is exciting,
my cultural database shows

619
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,685
that fame is highly overrated
and ultimately not rewarding.

620
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,847
Would you agree?

621
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,646
Oh, totally. Way overrated.

622
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,047
Hey, do you think
they'll name a street after me?

623
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,766
Or a cologne?

624
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,323
"Ratchet. Smell like a hero."

625
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,168
There he is!

626
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,801
Can I smell you?

627
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,325
Easy, now. There's no rush.

628
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,765
Believe me, I could do this all day.

629
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,841
Uh?

630
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:34,525
Sorry, folks, but, unfortunately,
we don't have time for this nonsense.

631
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,288
I'm about to reveal my awesome plan
for the attack on Drek Industries,

632
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,882
unless, of course,
anyone would like my autograph.

633
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,482
Good, because we don't have time.

634
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,971
You the man, Ratchet!

635
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,604
I love you all!

636
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,204
He's taller in person!

637
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,521
Hmm.

638
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,161
All right, Rangers,
our plan of attack is simple.

639
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,445
HALO drop into Skorg City,
fire a whole mess o' bullets,

640
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,366
and take Drek into custody so we
can be home in time for waffles.

641
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,325
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah! Yeah, waffles!

642
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,606
Oh, that's good.

643
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,008
Wait, that's our plan?

644
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,725
Yes, it is.

645
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,882
Pardon me, Captain,
but Chairman Drek is cunning.

646
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,685
He will be prepared for our assault.

647
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,202
Look, I think it is beyond adorable
that you decided to do all this homework.

648
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,203
But big heroes do big things.

649
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,163
Each second we waste talking is a second
Drek could use to destroy another planet.

650
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,403
But wouldn't it be worth taking
five minutes to review our plan?

651
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,766
We have holoschematics...

652
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,125
Does anyone else feel like we
should have shot something by now?

653
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,646
Because it really feels like we
should have shot something by now.

654
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,805
Thank you!

655
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,845
Let's take a vote.

656
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,082
All those in favor of
kicking in Drek's front door

657
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,483
with a massive arsenal and restoring
peace to a galaxy in turmoil, say "Aye."

658
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,805
Aye!

659
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,485
All those in favor of nerding it up here
with some pie charts, say "Nay."

660
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,045
- Nay.
- Motion passes.

661
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,202
We assault Drek Industries tonight!

662
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,965
Lock and load, Rangers!

663
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,168
Suit up and rally in the aft airlock.

664
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,405
Although I am happy to help
with the mission in any capacity,

665
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,565
I find this arrangement
slightly embarrassing.

666
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,522
I'm sorry, but you're the only one
who's been inside Drek's warbot factory.

667
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,807
Besides, this is the best way
for you to keep up.

668
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,525
Whoa!

669
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,647
Nice backpack.

670
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,764
Remember, your thrusters
are powered by Ratchet's suit,

671
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,205
so don't try any solo flights. Okay?

672
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,565
I shall endeavor to...

673
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,165
He's in good hands, Elaris.

674
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,085
You sure you want to take
the, uh, extra baggage?

675
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,605
No offense, but we're dropping
straight into a cauldron.

676
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,160
And do you know
what's inside that cauldron?

677
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,884
- Is it danger?
- It's...

678
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,329
Yes, it's danger.

679
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,611
Let's roll!

680
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,645
All right, team. Let's bring it in.

681
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,005
Remember, our target is Chairman Drek!

682
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,161
Ready, Rangers?

683
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,165
On the count of three.

684
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,641
Three!

685
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,571
Keep up, rookie!

686
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,843
All right, pal, you ready?

687
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,081
Well, I...

688
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,841
Whoo-hoo!

689
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,161
Yeah!

690
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,840
Yeah!

691
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,161
Yeah!

692
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,521
Whoo!

693
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,361
Ah!

694
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,646
I'm in. Any sign of Drek?

695
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,885
Negative.

696
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,724
Place looks deserted.

697
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,049
My internal coordinates system
indicates a right turn up ahead.

698
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,045
Eh. My gut says this way, Clank.

699
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,040
Glad you're getting in touch with your
feelings, newbie, but we're turning right.

700
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,405
Because?

701
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,041
Because I'm your senior Ranger
and I say so. That's why.

702
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,724
Okay! Okay.

703
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,645
Yeesh! Cranky.

704
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,605
- What's that?
- Huh? Oh.

705
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,401
I said, "thank ye" for
those words of wisdom.

706
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,561
Good save.

707
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,685
This feels too easy.

708
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,005
Why was there no alarm?

709
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,645
It is strange.

710
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,370
Everyone, stay sharp.

711
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,561
Initiate Phase One.

712
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,081
Let's scatter the cockroaches.

713
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,729
Just push the button, Zed!

714
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,601
Yoo-hoo!

715
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,125
Zurkon, zurkon.

716
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,891
Zurkon, zurkon.

717
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,130
Zurkon, zurkon, zurkon...

718
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,525
Anyone hear that?

719
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,090
Zurkon, zurkon, zurkon.

720
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,444
Engaging motion scan.

721
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,291
I'm getting something.

722
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,561
Yeah.

723
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,325
Me, too.

724
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,724
Zurkon, zurkon, zurkon.

725
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,723
Zurkon, zurkon, zurkon...

726
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,841
Huh?

727
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,201
Yoo-hoo!

728
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,645
Zurkons!

729
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,042
Mr. Zurkon is looking to kill you!

730
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,281
Yoo-hoo!

731
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,411
Boom, baby!

732
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,161
Yoo-hoo!

733
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,201
Yoo-hoo!

734
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,406
Yeah!

735
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,567
Three-time galactic champ up in here!

736
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,330
Ranger identified. Terminate!

737
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,605
What's a Zurkon?

738
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,763
Robotic bodyguards.
They protect whoever deploys them.

739
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,366
Mr. Zurkon has you now.

740
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,805
- Zurkon hates Galactic Rangers!
- Heads up!

741
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,641
Whoa!

742
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,843
Yoo-hoo!

743
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,450
Nice shot. Do that again,
and I'll shoot you myself.

744
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,484
What is this place?

745
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,765
Huh.

746
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,205
If I may...

747
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,401
Hmm.

748
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,643
Yoo-hoo!

749
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,690
Stupid Ranger. Time to die!

750
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,803
Mr. Zurkon delivers a symphony of pain!

751
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,405
Don't move.

752
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,405
I'm listening.

753
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,481
Captain Qwark.

754
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,005
I've been watching you
these past few days,

755
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,965
and I think it's simply dreadful what...

756
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,565
- Zed!
- Sorry.

757
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,769
Simply dreadful what
Ratchet has done to you.

758
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,688
He's made people
forget who the real hero is.

759
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:33,931
All you wanted to do was protect
the galaxy, and how do they repay you?

760
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,245
By dropping you for some...
Well, I don't even know what he is!

761
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:42,126
Even if that were true, I could
never betray the citizens of Solana.

762
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,609
My friend, betraying them is how
you get them to love you.

763
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:55,121
Allow me to introduce you to my personal
team of Blargian PR professionals.

764
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,680
Lads, tell him how we work our magic!

765
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,845
As far as I can see,
you're the victim here.

766
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,002
That Lombax pushed you to do this.

767
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,081
He did?

768
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,325
You were desperate,
emotionally scarred, depressed, even!

769
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,885
You didn't know what you were doing.

770
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,361
The betrayal was a cry for help.

771
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,363
- It was?
- It will be!

772
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,006
A tell-all book,
a few guest appearances...

773
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,281
A holo-film.

774
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,804
No! A trilogy!

775
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:24,405
In six months' time, you won't
just be Captain Qwark the hero...

776
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,962
You'll be Captain Qwark the survivor. Huh?

777
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,165
No one needs to get hurt, Captain.

778
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,844
We can evacuate the planet

779
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:37,084
and give these people a new place to live,
a better place to live.

780
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,250
Do we have a deal?

781
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,481
Huh?

782
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:46,841
Hmm.

783
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,891
Fascinating.

784
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:53,325
These are plans for something
called a "Deplanetizer."

785
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,851
Deplanetizer?

786
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,925
Why would Drek be destroying planets?

787
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,764
Not destroy.

788
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,730
It seems that Drek is trying
to build the perfect planet.

789
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,725
Come on, let's move out!

790
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,529
Hey! Wait for me!

791
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,281
Wait! Wait!

792
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,405
Sorry, Zed!

793
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,165
I'll write you an excellent
letter of recommendation!

794
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,202
You don't even have my email!

795
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,767
It's Spacegangsta_72@Zed.com!

796
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,685
Oh!

797
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,641
Hi.

798
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,643
Um...

799
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,291
Before you start in
with the, um, questioning,

800
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,166
it's important you understand
that I am faithful to my employer.

801
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,685
And that's how I found out
I was lactose intolerant,

802
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,485
though I think the parakeet
would've died anyway,

803
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,324
because he was always flying
into the window, which is...

804
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,445
She wouldn't drop him, would she?

805
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,521
Maybe.

806
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,483
When I said, "Tell us everything."
I meant Drek's target list.

807
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,005
Now, out with it!

808
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,321
Probably.

809
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,165
I would be more than happy to
supply you with the target list,

810
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,643
but, unfortunately, I signed a legally
binding non-disclosure agreement.

811
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,645
I want the rest of his targets.

812
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,165
- Now!
- Please.

813
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,530
This was supposed to be a temp job
until I got my singing career on track.

814
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,964
Okay, okay!

815
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,125
Novalis.

816
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,248
He wants Novalis.

817
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,845
Novalis?

818
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,684
Novalis is populated.

819
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:31,925
Yes, 43,618,924 people, to be exact.

820
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,685
The Schnorkelsons had twins this morning.

821
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,566
We've got to move.

822
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,684
Hey! Captain Qwark! Buddy!

823
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,645
Remember me?

824
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,166
From Drek's office?
Where you signed that contract and...

825
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,721
Shh!

826
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,046
Not the face!

827
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,325
Dear Diary... I mean, journal. Yes.

828
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,803
Dear Journal, I've been
having the mood swings again.

829
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,365
One minute, I'm laughing hysterically.

830
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,565
The next minute, I'm laughing maniacally.

831
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:35,245
I guess it's because everything
is going exactly according to plan.

832
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,605
Soon, I'll be long gone,

833
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,763
and the entire solar system
will be nothing

834
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,844
but a giant cloud of dust and gas.

835
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,042
Excuse me, Doctor.

836
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,845
Chairman Drek would like to see you.

837
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,604
How long have you been standing there?

838
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,524
I came in during the part
about dust and gas?

839
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,285
It's my dietary journal.

840
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:03,527
I keep a very strict record of everything
I eat and which foods give me...

841
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,040
Dust and gas?

842
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,885
Exactly.

843
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,885
Cool.

844
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,367
General Qwark moves into position.

845
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,201
Ooh.

846
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:25,205
Cleverly, he deactivates the weapons
system, and the crowd goes wild.

847
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,887
Yeah! Yeah! Qwark is the best! Yeah!

848
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:38,042
Novalis Control, evac shuttle
convoy 262 departing orbit.

849
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,128
Evacuation 82% complete.

850
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,687
Fighters ready to rock.
So what's the plan, Captain?

851
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,565
Uh? Oh... The plan?

852
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,644
Yes. Here's what
we're going to do, Rangers.

853
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,245
I'll go in first and try to reason
with this Drek character,

854
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:58,644
see if we can talk this out, mano-a-mano.

855
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,085
Talk? I don't follow, sir.

856
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,605
Sir, he's blown up five planets already!

857
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,364
I think we're done talking.

858
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,927
Captain, if we can just take 30 seconds,
I think I have an idea.

859
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,963
Sure. Go ahead.

860
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,168
Well, I was looking at the schematics
of the Deplanetizer...

861
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,725
- Yeah.
- ...and it occurred to me...

862
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,131
And mute.

863
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,325
I'm going in.

864
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,290
Captain, wait! Back-up is on the way!
We should...

865
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,565
Hostile ship on approach, sir.

866
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,290
Should we fire proton cannons?

867
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,851
Not yet.

868
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,487
I've got a shiny new puppet down there,
and I'm about to put on a show.

869
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,203
"Starting secret mission.

870
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,405
"Hero work ain't easy.

871
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,882
"#Humblebrag, #Killinglt,

872
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,045
"#NoFilter, #NotAMole."

873
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,205
- Ah!
- I'm not a sellout!

874
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,169
Captain Qwark!

875
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,245
You performed marvelously.

876
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,369
Be honest, are you a professional actor?

877
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,365
Well, I did dabble in my share
of theater back in grade school.

878
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,845
Every year, I'd play the dad...

879
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:08,766
Yes, an enthralling saga I'd love to hear!

880
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,004
But first, you've disabled
the weapons system

881
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,003
on the Rangers' fleet, right?

882
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,085
Oh, just as a safety precaution, mind you.

883
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:21,688
We wouldn't want a tense situation
to escalate out of control.

884
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,205
Of course, we wouldn't want that.

885
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,489
And I have your word that my team
isn't going to get hurt, right?

886
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,605
Oh, my dear captain!

887
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,489
Where's the trust?

888
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,681
Destroy them all.

889
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,529
Contact! Contact!

890
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,130
All units, engage.

891
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,364
Error. Error. Weapons system compromised.

892
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,805
Cannons! Missiles!

893
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,326
Weapon systems are negative
across the board!

894
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,525
Same here! I got nothing!

895
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,524
We've been sabotaged. Rangers, fall back!

896
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,324
Break off! Break off!

897
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,723
The Rangers are retreating, sir.

898
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:18,881
Brilliant.

899
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,041
Hmm.

900
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,048
Get me a holo-scan of that ship.

901
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,321
Right away, sir.

902
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,041
Well, lookee-lookee.

903
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,324
What have we here?

904
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,561
The defect.

905
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,325
Ah, yes, the one that got away.

906
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,084
Not this time.

907
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,925
Are you sure, Victor?

908
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,365
He looks awfully dangerous.

909
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,405
Teleport me to the ship.

910
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,125
It's impossible, sir. It's shielded.

911
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,611
Just get me close!

912
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,924
No, I can't leave him.

913
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,285
Ratchet, what are you doing?

914
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,606
I'm going in!

915
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,245
Ratchet, don't do this.

916
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,971
If you give us a minute,
we can work out an assault plan!

917
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,281
There's no time!

918
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,563
Captain Qwark is in there fighting
an entire army on his own!

919
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,125
Permission to land?

920
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,449
Permission granted.

921
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,445
Mmm.

922
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,765
Who's on foot duty?

923
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,127
Tootsie rub, come on.

924
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,041
Ah!

925
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,962
Their defensive fire is too strong.

926
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,008
Pull back! Your fighter won't make it.

927
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,925
I don't have to land!

928
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,809
I just have to get close.

929
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,443
Hull integrity at 2%.

930
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,085
Prepare to teleject.

931
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,322
Ratchet, please, listen to Elaris.

932
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:58,486
The odds of surviving a head-on assault
is roughly 600,993 to one!

933
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,768
Big heroes do big things.

934
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,248
Three, two, one...

935
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,849
He made it!

936
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,161
What was that?

937
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,647
I do not know. I will investigate.

938
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,244
Probably just the ship settling.

939
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,530
Nothing to be alarmed about.

940
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,001
Whoa!

941
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:29,921
Ah!

942
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,206
Defect!

943
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:32,805
Oh, my.

944
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,362
I am coming for you, Defect!

945
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,641
Uh, I believe we may have a problem.

946
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,644
Coming through!

947
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,925
Star Cracker Chamber,

948
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,209
47 meters southwest,
then slight right ahead.

949
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,845
Ratchet? Where are you?

950
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,481
Can't talk! I'm almost
at the control center.

951
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,763
Captain Qwark did something to the ship!
Nothing's working!

952
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,805
And I think Clank's in trouble!

953
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,565
Roger that! As soon as I stop
the Deplanetizer from firing,

954
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,801
I'll be right back to help.

955
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,289
Deplanetizer now online.

956
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,568
Bravo, my boy!

957
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,001
Bravo!

958
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:21,402
I deal with my share of
morons on a daily basis,

959
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,841
but this?

960
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,764
This is seriously next level!

961
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,441
Take him.

962
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,369
Where are you?

963
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,250
Come out and fight!

964
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,089
You want a fight? I'll give you a fight.

965
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,881
No free rides!

966
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,161
Hmm.

967
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,001
Die!

968
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,481
Get back here!

969
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:06,804
I'm going to make you wish
you were never created!

970
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,964
Thundersmack equipped.

971
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,042
You're nothing but a pathetic defect!

972
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,521
Perhaps. But I am waterproof.

973
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:46,404
Defect!

974
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,881
Hey! Over here!

975
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,330
Can I switch sides now?

976
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,887
I never had a proper planet.

977
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,085
I spent my formative years underground,

978
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:10,562
where everything was dark and wet and hot.

979
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:14,401
And I was like, "Warrior?
No, I said I was a worrier!"

980
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,485
I worry about everything!

981
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,369
I... Oh, hey.

982
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,401
Qwark?

983
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,802
This is awkward.

984
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:35,081
The next time you and those moronic
Rangers decide to play hero...

985
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,129
...plan better.

986
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,608
Toss him into one of the shuttles.

987
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,200
I want him to live to see his failure.

988
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,845
Drek, don't do this!
Novalis is home to millions!

989
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:52,003
Yes, yes, and they had
their time in the sun.

990
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,969
Now it's our turn.

991
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,925
Commence deplanetization!

992
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,525
Ready the Deplanetizer!

993
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:07,761
No!

994
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,443
Well, here's your I.D. Welcome aboard.

995
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,081
- Captain?
- Huh?

996
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,331
Oh. Yeah. Thanks.

997
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,004
Release the harvesters!

998
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,602
In the wake of Novalis' destruction

999
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,802
and Captain Qwark's shocking betrayal,
Galactic President Phyronix has issued

1000
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,325
a galaxy-wide alert
to all Solana citizens.

1001
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,684
Residents are to remain in their homes
while authorities manage the crisis.

1002
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,445
And though the planet
was successfully evacuated,

1003
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,525
the question remains,
did we put our trust in the wrong Lombax?

1004
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,609
Uh...

1005
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:38,886
Can I come in?

1006
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,248
That protosuit of yours keeps beeping.

1007
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,887
All day, all night,
voices asking you to come back.

1008
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,645
Those Ranger hotshots are persistent.

1009
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:51,884
Yeah. Thanks, Grim.
I'll turn it off in the morning.

1010
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,886
Hey. I remember this.

1011
01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:00,484
You wandered into the garage
and took my rocket sled for a test drive.

1012
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:06,845
No fear, no safety check, you just flipped
the switch, and off you went.

1013
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:10,805
Took three police bots to chase you
down and teach you how to stop!

1014
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,761
I guess I just wanted to do something big.

1015
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,644
I wanted to matter, you know?

1016
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,485
I ain't never been very good with advice.

1017
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,409
But I do know this.

1018
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,601
To be a hero,
you don't have to do big things,

1019
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,171
just the right ones.

1020
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,485
That's actually not bad.

1021
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:38,525
Thank you.

1022
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,965
I have my moments.

1023
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,607
I'm okay.

1024
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:49,408
My dear, sweet Victor.

1025
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,925
You were a wonderful friend and companion.

1026
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,844
Honest. Loyal. Rusty.

1027
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,806
I mean, really rusty. I could hear you
all the way across the station.

1028
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:05,923
But still, we honor you with
this silent moment of reflection,

1029
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,685
as thanks for your sacrifice.

1030
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,483
You will be missed.

1031
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,361
Let's get this show on the road!

1032
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,001
Bring in New Quartu!

1033
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:25,001
Bring in New Quartu!

1034
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,169
Uh, how are things at home, Jeff?

1035
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,486
Great!

1036
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,685
It's beautiful.

1037
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:51,363
I did it, Father. I did it!

1038
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,522
- It's beautiful.
- Uh...

1039
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,282
I thought I might find you here.

1040
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,486
Clank?

1041
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,883
I'm not going back, Clank.

1042
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,401
This is where I belong. You were right.

1043
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:19,925
Fame is overrated, especially when you're
famous for causing a complete disaster.

1044
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,889
It was not a complete disaster.

1045
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,965
Authorities are calling it
a "complete and utter disaster"...

1046
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,246
Sorry!

1047
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,564
The evacuation of Novalis was successful.

1048
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,762
No one was killed or injured.

1049
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,365
But those people lost their homes,

1050
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:38,728
and for that, I have to
take full responsibility.

1051
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:43,565
Blaming yourself and taking responsibility
are two very different things.

1052
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,003
If you truly want to be accountable,

1053
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,208
you will endeavor to make things
right the next time.

1054
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,041
Next time?

1055
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:52,845
Drek has one more target on his list.

1056
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,287
With Captain Qwark
now working for the enemy,

1057
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,880
the Rangers need you more than ever.

1058
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:03,244
And I would like to offer
my assistance in any way possible,

1059
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,046
partner.

1060
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,928
Earthquake!

1061
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,771
What's that?

1062
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,923
Oh, I brought some friends.

1063
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:30,811
Okay, pity party's over.
Time to get back to work.

1064
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:36,803
Listen, guys,
I'm sorry I ran out on you like that.

1065
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:42,442
Even though I messed up, I should've
stayed to fix it and see it through.

1066
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:46,242
Eh. We've all made bad choices.
Here, check it out.

1067
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:47,850
My cadet photo.

1068
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,605
Really? That's how we're playing?

1069
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:57,490
Okay, uh, there's no need
to embarrass anyone here.

1070
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,163
Okay, everyone, chill out!

1071
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:05,885
We have a job to do, and I need to start
shooting at something immediately.

1072
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:09,642
Well, before we just go off and start
shooting at things, I was thinking that...

1073
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,085
Yeah, get some.

1074
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,445
That's what I'm talking about.

1075
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,567
Forget it.

1076
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,762
No, wait. Go on.

1077
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:18,764
I think we need to hear
what you both have to say.

1078
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:22,850
Well, while we can't move
a planet out of the way...

1079
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,127
I was thinking, what if we could move
the weapon targeting that planet?

1080
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,363
Move the Deplanetizer?

1081
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,084
Knock it off course.

1082
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,083
Okay. Awesome.

1083
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,805
And just how are we going to do that?

1084
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,247
Not sure yet. But I'm working on it.

1085
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,041
Hmm.

1086
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,522
I might have an idea.

1087
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,205
So after you pick up my dry cleaning,

1088
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,925
you need to polish the Segway,
and after that...

1089
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,650
Drek, I want to talk to you.

1090
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:55,491
You tried to kill my Rangers!
You said you'd leave them alone!

1091
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:58,241
And I meant it at the time!

1092
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,728
I detest bloodshed as much as any Blarg,

1093
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:07,125
but sometimes, sacrifices are
necessary for the greater good.

1094
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,645
I know you're working
with Nefarious on this.

1095
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,802
Yes, isn't it wonderful?

1096
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,611
We're all part of the same dream team.

1097
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,205
We should make T-shirts!

1098
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,362
You're making a big mistake.

1099
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,603
You have no idea the kinds
of evil he's capable of.

1100
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,603
Oh, but I do.

1101
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,365
It's all right here on his résumé.
Special skills...

1102
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:31,240
Horrendous evil. Unspeakable evil.
Diabolical evil.

1103
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,970
He's very well-rounded.

1104
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:36,163
And apparently, he can juggle. Hmm.

1105
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,526
Oh-oh!

1106
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,446
Do I feel my ears burning?

1107
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:44,241
And there's our
little juggling psychopath now!

1108
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,809
You died in a prison escape.
There were witnesses.

1109
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:48,921
Oh.

1110
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:52,522
People will say and do just about anything

1111
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,204
for the right price.

1112
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,402
What was yours, Qwark?

1113
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:59,930
What was your price
for selling out your friends?

1114
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:03,283
Your face on another cereal box, perhaps?

1115
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,761
Why don't you run along

1116
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:08,684
so the Chairman and I can get back
to the business at hand?

1117
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:10,764
But what am I supposed to do?

1118
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,400
You can guard the Star Cracker
water cooler.

1119
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,087
Oh! But with fury! Mmm-hmm.

1120
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,885
That was fun!

1121
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:24,442
And T-shirts would be a good idea.
Good for morale.

1122
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,284
What do you think, Neffie? Should we...

1123
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:33,968
Sheepinator. One of my personal favorites.

1124
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:37,603
It's time for a change of management.

1125
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,482
Huh? Uh-oh...

1126
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:45,849
Okay, let's do this!
We only got so much time to get it all done.

1127
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,531
Use that, whatever that's called.
That's good. Okay.

1128
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,125
Right. Over here.

1129
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,443
Keep bringing it on in, ratcheting it on up,
electrifying everything.

1130
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:57,485
Make sure everything's got electricity
running through it, at least a little bit.

1131
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:00,445
That's good, too.
Whatever that is, you're doing great.

1132
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:01,681
Okay.

1133
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,044
Hey, everybody! Get in here now!

1134
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,210
Uh, please.

1135
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,764
You're not going to believe this.

1136
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:15,605
We finally decoded the Deplanetizer plans.

1137
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:19,002
We found his next target. It's Umbris.

1138
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,725
Well, at least he picked
an empty planet this time.

1139
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,531
Yes, however, it is a volatile planet.

1140
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:27,241
Its core is made up of pure melluvium.

1141
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:31,728
Blowing it up will result in a chain reaction
that will destroy the entire system.

1142
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,685
But why would Drek do that?

1143
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,842
I thought he was trying to
build the perfect planet?

1144
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:39,129
Well, because Umbris wasn't Drek's idea.

1145
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:40,401
Duh!

1146
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:41,606
What do you mean?

1147
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,045
It's Nefarious.

1148
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,360
Dr. Nefarious?

1149
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:47,563
No, Steve Nefarious.
Of course it's Dr. Nefarious!

1150
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:49,444
Oh, yeah, funny how
you didn't mention that

1151
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,285
when I was dangling you
over the edge of a building.

1152
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,249
Well, you didn't ask, now did you?

1153
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:55,044
Okay, that's it. I'm shooting him.

1154
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,525
What? Don't shoot him.

1155
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:00,127
I am confused.
I thought Nefarious was dead.

1156
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:01,525
Only on the inside.

1157
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,762
Otherwise, he's very much...

1158
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:05,763
Alive!

1159
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:07,891
Okay, shoot him.

1160
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,608
- You wanted New Quartu?
- Huh?

1161
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,485
I'll give it to you.

1162
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,085
Happy trails!

1163
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,927
Now entering Umbris atmosphere.

1164
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:38,884
Yes, it's almost here.

1165
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,811
The beginning of the end.

1166
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:42,967
The end of what?

1167
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,921
Let the games begin.

1168
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,248
Remote detonation now activated.

1169
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:55,449
It is about to get real.

1170
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,881
We're as close as we can get
without being spotted.

1171
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,281
Okay, so what's the plan, Elaris?

1172
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,129
Go on. We're listening.

1173
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,605
Well, I've been hard at work
on a little something called

1174
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,284
the Hologuise.

1175
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:20,968
It'll project a visual and audible
replication of Captain Qwark so realistic,

1176
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:22,844
it would fool his own mother.

1177
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:26,645
With Ratchet posing as Qwark,
they'll dock with the Deplanetizer

1178
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,802
by easily fooling the simpleminded Blarg.

1179
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,483
Yes, Captain. What can I do you for?

1180
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:34,564
Greetings, citizen.
Just returning from patrol.

1181
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,007
Copy that. Deactivating shield grid 24 A.

1182
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:40,284
Once inside, Ratchet and Clank
will make their way

1183
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,931
through the Star Cracker
chamber to the inner core.

1184
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:53,004
When Ratchet exposes the stabilizer,
it can quickly be disconnected...

1185
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,321
Yes. Got it.

1186
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,565
Meanwhile, Clank will disable
all the other weapons

1187
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:00,971
by hacking into the mainframe.

1188
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,084
Weapons system disabled.

1189
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:07,525
Leaving the Deplanetizer completely
vulnerable to any outside forces.

1190
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,011
Warning. Warning. Core stabilizer offline.

1191
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:14,367
Run away! Everybody panic!

1192
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,642
- Warning. Warning.
- What's happening?

1193
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,685
Warning. Core stabilizer offline.

1194
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,962
Dr. Nefarious, sir... I mean, Doctor!

1195
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:23,201
Where are you going?

1196
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:27,609
Me? Nowhere. Certainly not out
of a system-wide blast radius.

1197
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,165
- What?
- What?

1198
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:30,401
We've been infiltrated.

1199
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:33,125
The Galactic Rangers are trying
to shut down the Deplanetizer,

1200
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,282
and I can't find Chairman Drek anywhere!

1201
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:36,407
Ah!

1202
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:39,205
You want something done right,
you have to do it yourself.

1203
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,564
- Warning. Warning.
- Huh?

1204
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,887
Core stabilizer offline.

1205
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,206
Everybody panic!

1206
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:47,566
Ratchet...

1207
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,845
And we're clear. All units, move in.

1208
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:56,684
Yeah! Way to go, you guys!

1209
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,889
Ratchet!

1210
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,810
Greetings, Cadet.

1211
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:03,845
Captain Qwark, on behalf
of the Galactic Rangers,

1212
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,922
I'm placing you under arrest.

1213
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:09,290
You can't do that.
I'll just arrest you right back!

1214
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:10,965
On what charge?

1215
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,850
False arrest? Being annoying? Who cares?

1216
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:16,487
You stabbed your own team
in the back, Qwark!

1217
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,245
Just like you stabbed me in the back,

1218
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:23,525
taking my fans, my sponsors,
my lucrative endorsement deals,

1219
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,364
my parking space!

1220
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,169
You were my hero.

1221
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,845
Now you're no better than Nefarious!

1222
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,763
How dare you.

1223
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:34,771
I am way better-looking than Nefarious!

1224
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,405
I'm taking you in.

1225
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,282
By force, if necessary.

1226
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,171
Oh, wittle wombax with a wittle gun!

1227
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:46,601
Huh.

1228
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:53,725
Qwark, stop! You don't want to do this!

1229
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,928
Don't tell me what I want to do!

1230
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:00,123
On your left, Ratchet. Now your right.

1231
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,641
Huh?

1232
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,126
Enough, Qwark!

1233
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:15,881
Whoa!

1234
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:23,610
Nefarious is tricking you! He wants you
to destroy the entire system!

1235
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,406
Oh, that's right, you know everything.

1236
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:27,561
Uh-oh!

1237
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,241
Hey, why don't we all
just listen to Ratchet?

1238
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,205
Ratchet, look out!

1239
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:35,281
Whoa!

1240
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:36,881
Oh, my.

1241
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,764
Buzz Blades? I taught
you better than that!

1242
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:49,324
Some of it got in my mouth!
It's in my mouth!

1243
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,209
He's just too good.

1244
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,531
Oh, dear.

1245
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:58,966
Whoa!

1246
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,161
Clank!

1247
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:06,489
Tornado Launcher!

1248
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:11,288
Nefarious may be a homicidal lunatic,
but he sure can build a gun.

1249
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:14,444
Qwark, please! You're not a villain!

1250
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,725
You're not like Nefarious.

1251
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,007
This isn't you, and you know it!

1252
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:26,170
If Umbris is destroyed,
everyone will die, including us!

1253
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,406
Is that how you want to be remembered?

1254
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,005
I'm... I'm sorry.

1255
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:59,842
I don't know how things got this far.

1256
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,002
This is just pathetic!

1257
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,765
Nefarious.

1258
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,764
Give it up. It's over.

1259
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,925
As head of the Galactic Rangers, uh,

1260
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,645
he's here to place you under arrest.

1261
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:12,721
Me?

1262
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:13,845
Absolutely.

1263
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:18,205
Arrest this man for his speakable
crimes against the galaxy.

1264
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,685
My crimes?

1265
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,889
The real crime is how you treated me!

1266
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:26,523
The Rangers couldn't even
give me a proper laboratory!

1267
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,443
We have an operational budget!

1268
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:31,285
You called me "King of the Nerd Herd!"

1269
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,767
It was a term of endearment!

1270
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:37,282
Day after day, I slaved away,

1271
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:40,244
creating all the weapons and devices

1272
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,687
that made you look like a hero.

1273
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,448
But you're not a hero.
You're not even a good villain!

1274
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,807
You're the galaxy's biggest joke.

1275
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:50,366
Maybe.

1276
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:53,643
But now the last laugh is on you.

1277
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,241
Wait, what? That didn't make any sense.

1278
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:59,045
- Sure it did.
- No, it didn't.

1279
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,963
It sounded like you were combining

1280
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,566
"The joke is on you"
with "I'll have the last laugh."

1281
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:05,085
Take your pick.

1282
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,810
That's not how it works!

1283
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,321
Get ready to engage mag-boosters!

1284
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,528
Ratchet and Clank are still inside.

1285
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:20,162
Drek's going to fire at any moment!
We don't have any more time!

1286
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:27,925
My point is, if you're going to use
a one-liner, it should make sense,

1287
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,480
and be relevant to the situation!

1288
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:35,885
Look, I workshop thousands of these
a year, and they can't all be gold!

1289
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,564
Now, put your hands in the air!

1290
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,404
Over your dead body!

1291
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:40,881
Whoa!

1292
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,126
Incoming.

1293
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,163
Whoa!

1294
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,041
Mommy!

1295
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,965
Dialing Mother.

1296
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:06,042
Hello, Horkelberg residence!

1297
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,883
Mag-boosters engaged!

1298
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:19,886
Full power!

1299
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,160
It's working.

1300
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:34,401
Stay with it.

1301
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:37,326
Steady now! Steady!

1302
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,171
Whoa!

1303
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,651
What's happening?

1304
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:47,281
Whoa!

1305
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,364
Deplanetizer now online.

1306
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:53,041
Qwark! Don't let him turn it on!

1307
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,967
Get off me, you has-been!

1308
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,882
You know, maybe Drek was right.

1309
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,244
I am a mad scientist.

1310
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,961
Whoo-hoo! They missed!

1311
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:37,806
Lousy, insolent, idiotic...

1312
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,165
Break off. Break off!

1313
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:00,971
Copy that.

1314
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,321
Ratchet, you have to get out of there now!

1315
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:12,844
Weapon locker depleted.

1316
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:13,961
Hmm.

1317
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:18,164
Yeah. We're working on it.

1318
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:23,362
No! My plan! You've ruined my plan!

1319
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:28,522
You've had this one coming
a long time, Qwark!

1320
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:33,885
Of all my brilliant creations,

1321
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,725
it remains one of my favorites.

1322
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,325
Meet the RYNO,

1323
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:42,563
as in, "Rip You A New One."

1324
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:46,322
- Hey, Nefarious?
- What?

1325
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,642
Meet the Omniwrench.

1326
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,651
Warning. Now entering Umbris atmosphere.

1327
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,280
Any ideas?

1328
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,561
Hmm.

1329
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:20,325
Come on, guys. Get out of there. Come on!

1330
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,685
They'll never make it out in time.

1331
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,921
We've got to help.

1332
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,241
It's too late. There's nothing we can do.

1333
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,405
We must find one of Drek's teleporters!

1334
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,687
- I saw one on the bridge!
- Watch out!

1335
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,005
Hang on, boys.

1336
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,525
It's here! Hit the brakes!

1337
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,761
Relax, I know what...

1338
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:58,445
- Qwark!
- Oh, no.

1339
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,965
I can't reach you in time.
Just get out while you can!

1340
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:04,088
- Teleporter charging.
- Hmm.

1341
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:07,921
What are you doing?

1342
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:11,525
Improvising!

1343
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,761
Oh!

1344
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,647
Are we dead?

1345
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:46,761
Huh?

1346
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:48,925
We are alive.

1347
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,321
All Rangers alive and accounted for.

1348
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,251
Whoo! Welcome back, Rangers! Good job!

1349
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:58,609
How many planets do you think I'll have
to save for them to call me a hero again?

1350
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:01,885
You don't have to do big things
to be a hero, Qwark.

1351
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,689
Just the right ones.

1352
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:07,647
Oh.

1353
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:15,002
I don't know,
maybe it'll be worth something someday.

1354
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:18,361
Hmm.

1355
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:19,925
I must say that it is curious

1356
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,125
that the sudden cessation of velocity
relative to our inertia

1357
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,043
did not cause either of you to...

1358
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:26,567
Oh, dear.

1359
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:29,491
Don't worry, Cadet.
It happens to the best...

1360
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:34,811
Oh, that was terrible.

1361
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,003
Oh, boy.

1362
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,564
Make it stop!

1363
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:46,522
Should we go and join the others?

1364
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:50,844
I'd like to, but there's a promise
I have to keep to an old friend.

1365
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:54,731
I understand.

1366
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:59,525
Don't worry. I'm sure we'll run
into each other again someday.

1367
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,170
It's a small galaxy.

1368
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:05,005
Well, I suppose this is goodbye.

1369
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,968
You can let go now, Ratchet.

1370
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:14,845
Ah...

1371
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,402
Come on, what's the holdup?

1372
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,765
Paying good money for this.

1373
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:28,330
I haven't got all day!

1374
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:30,925
And that was the scene today

1375
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,365
as thousands gathered to welcome
home the Galactic Rangers,

1376
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:37,922
making their triumphant return
from saving our galaxy.

1377
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,885
Grateful citizens gathered
at the famed Hall of Heroes

1378
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:44,123
to mark this day that will live
in hearts and minds forever.

1379
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:46,485
As for Private Qwark,
the recently demoted Ranger

1380
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,245
will embark upon
his galaxy-wide apology tour

1381
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:51,685
while shamelessly promoting his new book,

1382
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,127
Listen, I Said I Was Sorry, All Right?

1383
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,929
When asked for a comment,
the former captain had this to offer.

1384
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:03,646
Prepare to be blown away
by my epic humility.

1385
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:09,485
There was, however, one curious
absence from today's festivities,

1386
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:13,724
that of new Ranger sensation
and media darling, Ratchet,

1387
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:16,325
leaving this reporter with one question.

1388
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:19,925
What does a Lombax do
after saving the galaxy?

1389
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,965
We may never know.

1390
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:25,886
And now, a story about a baby glypod
who can play the ukulele.

1391
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,442
Come on, we haven't got all day!

1392
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:32,964
We have 10 more proton scrubs to do before
lunch if we want to stay on schedule!

1393
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:37,205
I've got to be honest, I kind of thought
you'd be so touched by the gesture,

1394
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,123
you'd call us even.

1395
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:41,928
Well, you thought wrong, didn't you?

1396
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:46,842
Ah, keep your shirt on, I heard you.
You see these ears?

1397
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:53,246
Hey! Wait! Wait! Please wait for me!
I have abandonment issues!

1398
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:57,844
Might I offer a suggestion?

1399
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:04,925
Modifying that proton scrubber
with a Gadgetron quasar flash

1400
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,288
would increase your efficiency by 47.4%.

1401
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:11,690
A quasar flash, huh? Gee, I don't know.

1402
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:15,049
That kind of tech takes two to operate.

1403
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:18,040
And Grim's not as nimble as he used to be.

1404
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:21,443
Then perhaps I could
remain here and assist,

1405
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,841
if you do not mind me
staying around a while.

1406
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:24,921
You kidding?

1407
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,526
Things have been way too quiet
without you around.

1408
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:31,042
I do bring a certain level
of zing to the table, don't I?

1409
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:35,645
Yeah, Clank. You're a real wild one.

1410
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:36,925
Speaking of which,

1411
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,527
am I to assume that you have
retired from the Galactic Rangers?

1412
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:44,405
Nah. Once a Ranger, always a Ranger.

1413
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:48,725
Believe me, the minute somebody tries to
blow up another planet, I'll be ready to go.

1414
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,246
But, hey, what are the odds
of that happening?

1415
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:55,446
Precisely 87,534 to one.

1416
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,721
Yep. A real wild one.

1417
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,449
No! Get away from me!

1418
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:26,803
Do not stick that thing in...

1419
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,484
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1420
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:33,446
Quit trying to repair me, you moron!

1421
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:43,525
I am not a robot!

1422
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:30,043
Huh? Are you still here?

1423
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:33,522
All the logos and doohickeys
already went by.

1424
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:37,165
That means it's over. Move along.

1425
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:39,811
No extra little scene
at the end of the movie.

1426
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:45,288
If I find out who started that nonsense,
why, I'm going to plant my boot so far up...

1427
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,805
I said, beat it!

1428
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:48,881
Sheesh!
