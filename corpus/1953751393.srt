1
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,525
So he sat on a chair  go

2
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:41,236
Frank, I need you to do what he

3
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:44,469
Listen buddy,
I just say this once

4
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:50,306
Q2 him I really, really, but the
is not smooth

5
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,510
Department has invested a problem

6
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,256
And the loss of investments,
so I can feel better

7
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,359
is to kill someone

8
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:06,421
Hey! Lance Geverty, bloody career of trafficking in cocaine


9
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:10,335
I mean, look at what has happened in Pablo
Escaba view

10
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,531
Things like that should not

11
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,489
I moved to the City of Angels to pursue
dream

12
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,452
Like anything else, there are crossroads

13
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:40,233
I have pursued dreams of others,
guys partying, actor, director, editor

14
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:44,326
With the hope to improve the position
chain business

15
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:49,298
But most of them are unaware of the law
yourself playing games

16
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,499
The game begins with the following tricks

17
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,466
The smugglers

18
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,499
The only person can make this dream

19
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:29,448
First, we opened one strip bar, plenty of investors

20
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,378
more you get good feedback,
more people will be lining up to go on

21
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,287
Then to the drug, mass
large with numerous opportunities

22
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:42,485
Master  yourself, do not take taxes,
we turn it into your own kingdom

23
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:47,288
1 paradise with white sand and beautiful girl

24
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,394
But it was not enough

25
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:54,462
I need to go back to reality ,
to not like zombies

26
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:58,433
out only at night to make up the
belly and little cash

27
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:07,408
I find them adorable,
neighbor does not stick to medicine

28
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:11,321
Still living with their parents, hardworking college

29
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:16,294
Hot on the bed,
does not disappoint me

30
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:22,357
He really loves me.
I am a dream, that my berth

31
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:25,369
A sweet charm of reality

32
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,429
I call her Ashley

33
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:34,275
And for the future, I need to make sure that Eddie and I
can make this campaign

34
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,423
Boy, does nothing for me?

35
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,338
What the hell is this? Where is my money?

36
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,476
There is only that much, and all that

37
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,254
No missing. Where is my money?

38
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,357
That's gone

39
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,359
End already?

40
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,362
Wait 1 bit

41
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,391

42
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,531

Ok, I love you. Goodbye

45
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,475
All right, nowhere did I say that?
Oh, that's right.

46
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,440
Where is my money?

47
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,345
I swear it already

48
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:51,455
He dog  this, no money?

49
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,419
- Where's the Money?
- That's it, just barely making it

50
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,496
I do not add up

51
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:02,298
He can only cry

52
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:08,263
I do not claim to be,
I have to tell Frank that

53
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:13,243
Do not mention that Frank ,
I do not want any trouble here

54
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,510
I have to tell Frank that

55
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:21,320
I'm trying to help him but

56
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,356
Do you help? You are helping the stars?

57
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,517
Help something that helps?

58
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:32,424
I just say this once,
you go where the money for me.

59

Got that? Good boy.

60
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,232
Now go away.

00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,372
- I'm watching that.
- Leave the room now.

178
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,285
Bastard.

179
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:38,416
- Two people are not turned away, huh?
- Loudmouth bastard.

180
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,516
No different women.

181
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,520
Do you think it's funny how Frank?

182
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:49,267
- I do not laugh about it.
- Madsen Why did you kill?

183
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:52,394
- He is the source of it.
- Do not talk anymore.

184
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,473
- I need to remove brokers.
- Yeah.

185
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,510
I told you.
I have said many times before that.

186
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:03,338
I will seek cooperation, more money.
There is nowhere confusing you?

187
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:06,418
Well, I was trying to tell him, but he did not hear
.

188
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:11,313
- Should he kill him?
- He does not respect me.

189
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:15,484
Well, he does not respect him.
Why not say soon.

190
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,354
That's better then, Frank.

191
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,367
You know they will look to me?

192
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:26,361
No, not us.
Which is his only.

193
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,303
I did not kill anyone. As you do so.

194
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:33,377
Do not want to eat apples?
Or something well?

195
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:41,375
Frank... that they will kill you.

196
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:47,483
They do not kill, I die.
I will not live my life in my first hole in it.

197
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:52,227
I work we need to do.

198
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,365
Now what?

199
00:18:56,468 --> 00:19:02,498
I will adventure. Quickly
disperse some of this...

200
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:11,339
When they see the money we earn, they will be replaced by Franky
Madsen and Tony and Eddie.

201
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,509
He killed all star Tony?

202
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:18,355
Course. Buy 1 get 1 free that.

203
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:21,221
Frank, crazy map.

204
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,320
God.WWW.SUBTITRARI.PRO

205
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,458
Eddie, come on.

206
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:35,372
If done right, climb to the top.

207
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:40,275
There will be the day they catch us.

208
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:46,281
There will be a next  find you again, but
did everything possible before.

209
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,516
I will not die... someday.

210
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,517
But I will not die an anonymous way.

211
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,352
I will never be nameless.

212
00:19:56,495 --> 00:20:01,432
I was royalty there.
I am a descendant of kings.

213
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,366
That is it, this is the new Eddie.

214
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,461
Okay, listen.

215
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:11,504
All listen to me.

216
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:16,371
- Heck he is, Frank.
- Come on, cheer up going. Look at that view.

217
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:25,480
Thank you. Goodbye.

218
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:38,268
Those dogs. Investigating What okay.

219
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:47,410
Los Angeles.

220
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:07,422
How to call me so early?

221
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:11,491
I have no idle as you.

222
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:16,237
- What, still do not believe me?
- I do not trust anyone.

223
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,332
Some people will not like that.

224
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:22,470
- What say you?
- I said he was not wrong at all.

225
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:26,384
- There will be other days he was the only prick.
- Threatening me?

226
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:34,392
- Just a little advice for him alone.
- I advise you, sucking throat again.

227
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:41,426
Ferns which make regular payments to me.
Do not they know that you own.

228
00:21:55,514 --> 00:22:00,315
- Why?
- I went to check.

229
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,411
The name Reiley real problem.

230
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:10,489
A few months ago we have sent people to check
his place. Look.

231
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:16,365
Nothing looks suspicious?

232
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,466
Dispelling , it does not matter now.
Where's Department to the other?

233
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:26,343
- Focusing on services that go, ok?
- I understand.

234
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,484
Alo?

235
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:50,461
Hi, honey. Yes, he is only resting.

236
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:54,463
No, he did not forget. 7am right?

237
00:22:55,307 --> 00:23:00,472
Well, 6h. I, honey, I promise to you.

238
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:04,506
Yeah, I love you.

239
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:11,217
- Damn.
- There are people in trouble.

240
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:15,315
- Well, I was late already.
- I do not know, Frankie.

241
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:19,463
I do with her?

242
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:26,296
She  serious relationship only after the loss, a healthy girl
is genuine.

243
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:30,466
She finished? She is the only
certainly in my lifetime.

244
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:35,276
As a woman I want
format and with a family wedding.

245
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:46,348
- We're his family that.
- You think I want to live here all his stars?

246
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:56,460
Just to have the opportunity, I will take her...
Buy a farm.

247
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,362
- Farm?
- Born a team.

248
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:03,474
How can I help him  that.

249
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:07,378
No Where.

250
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,473
Let me say clearly.

251
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:17,347
- You make my take.
- No, my soldier is killed by it.

252
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:20,458
You do not have the money right?

253
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,318
You can earn more money, huh?

254
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:27,330
It's not my fault, it
is only an unfortunate accident.

255
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:32,267
Yes, it is bad luck.

256
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:40,274
I asked him that. No.

257
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,441
I beg you, I can not get kicked out like
. No way.

258
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,352
Stand up and fucking .

259
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:30,352
Putting the hell out of it.

260
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:34,398
Search on for my rows.

261
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:46,208
This is a commercial industry, and like every other industry
, it also has its own rules.

262
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:51,304
Nervous names, we selfish, stupid guys...
it's easy to trick goal.

263
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:57,388
I have to calm down, play by the rules,
market research and customer insights.

264
00:25:57,522 --> 00:26:01,253
I have to minimize risk and maximize
profit.

265
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,453
It is very basic laws, and also the
th most or forgotten.

266
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:09,266
To be frank, this is
industry worth billions.

267
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:17,501
Part of it is perfectly legal:
psychological treatment, medical care, prisons...

268
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,507
Only a small fraction of them are off to.
Less than 20%.

269
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:26,410
My question is:
eradicate this sector worth it?

270
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:29,316
I do not think so,
I support that government.

271
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:33,482
Without drugs, people are entitled to some people thought
would lose my job?

272
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:39,252
Government wants to increase the number of people
unemployment benefits?

273
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:45,270
Of course not. They just take advantage of it
to emphasize the fear among the people.

274
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:48,396
Corporations  opium traffickers smuggle drugs
in Mexico, the Russian mafia...

275
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,502
The message is very simple indeed.

276
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:54,376
Be careful with foreign men.
Yes, the United States.

277
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:59,347
Why
who can forget his roots?

278
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:02,419
By the way, who do not know the plant industry

279
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,355
opium growing pharmaceutical industry is the most you?

280
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:08,324
Yes. It was such garbage.

281
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,397
unrelated to morality or law.
Only economy is important here.

282
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:16,490
This is a commercial industry,
better than Wall Street.

283
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:19,428
Hope they sell, and I sell dreams.

284
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:22,301
Most of the time, I sold the dream
for those hoping to sell it.

285
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,399
Those are the people I do business,
Where to chew guys lip syncing.

286
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,336
We control this world.
At least I think so.

287
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:31,310
This place is great right .

288
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:36,378
But it will not make you forget everything where
Frank.

289
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:40,423
Why do I always scolded you?

290
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,452
Franky, he disappeared for a week there.

291
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:48,288
Where were you?

292
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:57,275
You know what you have not? Why
everything with him always the secret?

293
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:06,382
How can you believe him when he does not trust me
?

294
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,323
Yes, you're right. What he is doing...

295
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:21,364
Club  what there... Money is very stable, but it is not good for
a relationship.

296
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,529
Do you think so?

297
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:27,369
- I want to sell the club.
- No, do not.

298
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,508
- I do not want him to.
- Listen.

299
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,277
I want to do that.

300
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:38,272
I do not want to do this again, Ashley.

301
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,375
I want out of here and start over.

302
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:44,353
1 and buy horse farms.

303
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:49,315
Mews stars?
I do not want to live on the farm.

304
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,487
- Then I'll buy something else.
- Softly.

305
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:57,529
Yeah, I promise. But...
When he saw his family...

306
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:03,465
- I think that it's a bit boring.
- It was great.

307
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:11,506
Wonderful. He wants...
Franky us she wanted...

308
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:15,480
- They will have the same nose you.
- And his eyes.

309
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:18,448
Definitely like his right eye.

310
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:23,487
I get married.

311
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:28,465
Stars Are you serious?

312
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,459
Ask the children
a more dignified way to another day off.

313
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,297
Also.

314
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,424
- To not partying? Get in the car.
- What do you have?

315
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:05,401
There are things that are delicious.

316
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,407
- For a little baby?
- I do not want to inhale smoke at all.

317
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:23,453
- Come on.
- No, I only take cash only.

318
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:29,522
Come on, do it, do it.

319
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:32,329
- Get your hands.
- Come on.

320
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:34,431
Come on.

321
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,529
- Fool.
- Fuck off.

322
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,482
- As a guy, huh? - Yeah. Back then,
talk to him, bring him here.

323
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,291
Okay.

324
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,454
- Hey you.
- Hey.

325
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:09,426
I have a few questions to ask.
Back to the car over there.

326
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,290
Why did you do that?

327
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:36,225
- Damn.
- There are a few questions you need answered here.

328
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:40,355
- Bastards.
- Want to try me?

329
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:45,266
Now that clear?

330
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:49,399
- Know this guy?
- Dead guy.

331
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:53,505
's Right. Because who do you?

332
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:58,279
A guy that Eddie. Loud, partygoers.

333
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:03,480
- Find him where?
- He or take a bar in Madison 5.

334
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:13,424
- Thank you. - Do not get him done?
- All right, let's go.

335
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:24,468
God, then threw slide!

336
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,472
But almost hit it.
Is a little late.

337
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:34,508
Hey.

338
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,313
This is the lady asked him.

339
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:45,488
- She said to try it again.
- Well, is not it hot tonight.

340
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:59,307
For her, the princess.
God, again. Slide again.

341
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:03,279
Eddie, that's enough. Separated
my tank almost empty already.

342
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:07,211
What relation to me?

343
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:10,480
Calm down, it would be injured.

344
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:14,391
He just told me to calm you?

345

- I just remind you. - No, says
the get go. Do not tell me to calm down.

00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:29,466
Understand? I'll buy it off the bar, and for his

I know that. What is also approximate.

368
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,333
Almost right.

369
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:10,272
- Why are you here?
- Is due to my boyfriend.

370
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:16,344
- I do not want to cry anymore.
- So here she is right.

Under this huh?

393
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,221
Not okay?

394
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,481
Alright kid?

00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,321
Ashley, please do it. Do not seem like that.

436
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,223
Why?

437
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:13,428
I want you to be excited
2 girls sitting in the living room to the stars?

438
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:17,234
They are not related to him.
I know that they are people of Eddie.

439
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:21,468
Why would you want to stay with you, Frank?
His life, his friends...

440
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,506
Nothing like you.

441
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:32,286
Ashley, Ash...

442
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:58,438
Hey, they go that way.

443
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:04,443
- Eddie.
- You should understand these things

444
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,224
's business entirely.

445
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:09,488
Do not be afraid, Frank. On the go.

446
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:14,229
- What the hell is Eddie?
- Calm down son.

447
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:19,234
- Calm? Who are you?
- Frank, calmly.

448
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:23,304
Yeah, Frank slowly.
And not raise your voice.

449
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:30,310
- Fuck off. - Frank, calm down.
- Who is this guy right Ed?

450
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:36,351
Do not need violence that.
Just slowly stop talking.

451
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:42,248
Do you feel threatened, do not you?

452
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:47,328
Do not thoughtful.
Use your brain that thought away.

453
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:50,391
A chair for him to go.

454
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:57,340
Frank, do as he asked.

455
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:00,510
Listen, I have little trouble.

456
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:06,347
I enjoyed the two. It's there.
But I'm not happy.

457
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:11,380
Goods have been taken away.
And when I lose something,

458
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:15,390
I feel better if someone is killed.

459
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:22,423
Wait a minute. Before he came in,

460
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:29,500
I said we'll take his goods, sell it and get money
fill his pockets.

461
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:33,434
- Lots of money.
- Shut up.

462
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:37,275
There is a further problem.

463
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:42,350
I have 2 partners.
We are fed bullets to the head.

464
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:45,454
It's true that the real issue.

465
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:49,288
Listen, I can not make the dead live again...

466
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:54,329
But I can replace them.

467
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:59,368
More importantly, I can replace them.

468
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:03,396
You think you do it?

469
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:07,266
We were able to complete it.

470
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,293
This is because his buddies makes me angry.

471
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:29,330
You have to teach him how to behave, Eddie.

472
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:33,203
Listening to clarify this.

473
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:37,429
You'll have to sell my stock for 2 days.

474
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:42,538
No, I'll come back and kill you

475
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,281
with him.

476
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:51,445
- Clear?
- I get it.

477
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:54,480
Good.

478
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,231
2 single day that Eddie.

479
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:04,458
Two days.

480
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:09,499
Do not let me down.

481
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:14,444
Come .

482
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,510
Two days. There are two days.

483
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:30,255
- Is true or real.
- Or rather what this story?

484
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:33,490
I was alive, Frank.

485
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:40,232
His plan and effectively.

486
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:44,263
- You know...
- Why?

487
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,376
Stand up to.

488
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:50,504
- Hands are you okay?
- And he admits it.

489
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:57,409
- Then of course. - Home or good.
- And you like it that actor.

490
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,314
- Hey, it's okay with that?
- Damn.

491
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:03,393
Our plan  success then! Congratulations
.

492
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:23,239
Counting enough away.

493
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:30,380
Time differentiation.

494
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,311
Does anyone want to try?

495
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:17,393
I see?

496
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:26,236
Let's do it.

497
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,478
As for anything else?

498
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:39,243
Not much but it is enough to catch them then.

499
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:41,351
To me were Maxwell.

500
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:43,486
And Royce agent, why?

501
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:46,388
- She was waiting outside with a detailed report.
- Royce.

502
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,394
She does nothing for me?

503
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:57,231
I have infiltrated their group is
and build trust.

504
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:00,463
I was discussing business with Eddie.

505
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:03,339
Good.

506
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:10,245
I heard she had sex with one girl in it?

507
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:12,482
Tell me that.

508
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:16,309
It is in that report your boss.

509
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,446
Okay, I'll read it carefully.

510
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:24,460
I believe we have enough evidence thrown them in jail.

511
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:28,254
- I agree, we should do just that.
- It is easier to use?

512
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:33,327
If it fails to do from the first stars?
Maybe we should not hurry it.

513
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:40,301
But really, sir, we're not necessarily hiding anything
. They operate very intense.

514
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:44,371
Okay Maxwell. Please send 1 team closely monitored.

515
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:48,513
If nothing happens within 2 weeks, we will break into.

516
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:52,345
But no one is doing anything before.

517
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:55,482
I do not care what her actions. Got that?

518
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,294
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.

519
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,264
Okay, going to finish it.

520
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:04,334
- Beverly.
- Why?

521
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:08,362
He said what? I was paired up with someone?

522
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:10,497
Evan, you know the job is 1.

523
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:14,242
- I have no such right?
- There is not?

524
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:19,509
- I'm just worried about me.
- Yeah, ok...

525
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:23,218
- I know what you're doing.
- This is very dangerous,

526
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:25,448
I do not want you to stick to sprinkle
mess and can not get out.

527
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:29,253
You know how when he first met you before that.

528
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:32,419
Beverly, think carefully away.

529
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:37,494
You know, if he can not refrain from personal emotions
Job

530
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:41,293
then maybe we should think about this relationship.

531
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:44,407
O.

532
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:56,250
Frank, I like him, but I do not have time
to the day where...

533
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,388
I'm here to discuss the story, you hear me?

534
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:05,393
Heard you were always stocked, so I'll take half of
characters.

535
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:08,331
Half a sign huh?

00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:13,325
Yes, I am now expanding the business.
Out around the corner this.

537
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:16,262
- What are you doing?
- Why?

538
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:21,410
- I have to say I was star juicer?
- No, you're playing the game, and I'm hungry too.

539
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:25,506
- How dare you do that? - What are you doing?
- God, he also took another chocolate ice cream?

540
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:29,252
Only 1 bit that, but why are you so angry right?

541
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,388
- Calm down.
- Do not have to spend a map that people would rather not.

542
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:37,352
- Where Is Your Storage?
- I did not have one yet, I make it.

543
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:40,257
English drinking straight from the jug stars?

544
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:43,230
- Disgusting go.
- Depending on how you think.

545
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:49,397
Why would you do something so big?
Smoke a little bit and then go play the game and calm.

546
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,241
Everything's alright that.

547
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:55,277
- Really? I get in it?
- No.

548
00:51:55,412 --> 00:52:00,475
- Why not? - You can not just take half
Register here Heroin available. Is this where the level 3.

549
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:03,377
I took it to go right? Under the seat you?

00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:08,457
- But there will be tomorrow, 15 thousand semi signing.
-15 Thousand? Are you crazy?

551
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:11,352
Several other place full with 10 thousand only.

552
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:14,328
So by buying some other place to go.

553
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:19,293
Okay, tomorrow I'm going through. But there is no
samples?

554
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:25,340
Why are you laughing ? Prestige is doing that, I'm not sure
good restaurant instead.

555
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,376
This is my career, you know?

556
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:32,471
I understand, the better he should have known better, because he will not have
samples anywhere.

557
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:37,277
Okay, whatever, I'll be back tomorrow.

558
00:52:37,387 --> 00:52:41,289
- Yeah. Stay away from my refrigerator.
- Where do I have to close.

559
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:47,421
- I saw him driven to it.
- There was little trust as your brother.

560
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:49,431
BLT. That's his code.WWW.SUBTITRARI.PRO

561
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:51,400

00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:02,377
- Baby I go somewhere?
- Fuck off. - Why are you so?

564
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:05,305
- Crazy guy.
- Come on.

565
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:09,377
Hello.

566
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:15,350
- You're late Scott.
- Do not call me that, too rural. I've said many times before?

567
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:20,293
- Shut up Scottie. Can you believe I should know?
- I do not need this head start.

568
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,388
Did I say I know where to get paid right?

569
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:29,463
- What are you doing?
- I'll catch you.

570
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,472
- For possessing banned substances.
- TB go. - Listen.

571
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:37,405
I do not care about you or your name.

572
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:39,507
If you do not want to just point out
then perhaps you should think twice before.

573
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:45,320
Now you have the choice.
To be the only guy alive or dead?

574
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:48,414
- Okay. Calm down.
- I will ask only one time.

575
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:51,289
Who's going shipping?

576
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:16,319
- Enough all right?
- Yeah.

577
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,222
Do not ruin it.

578
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:24,316
This is a map of the apartment.

579
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:29,455
I'll be here. When have any of what happened, we started to move

00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,326
Please remember, that anyone run out

00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:37,303
Must  arrested, okay?

582
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:41,366
Team 1 and 2 bedroom 1 will take care of now.

583
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:05,234
Go.

584
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:26,422
Frank, are you all right?

585
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:30,393
I'm fine.

586
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:33,429
He's in there too long.

587
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:37,233
What's wrong?

588
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,468
You okay honey.

589
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,321
Come on.

590
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:06,256
- I do not think it's a good idea.
- I'm mad at you?

591
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,423
At dinner he worried that too.

592
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,428
- If not why do you want to do?
- Come on Ashley, you know...

593
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:16,497
This  him much stress.

594
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:20,408
- I know.
- So you want to go home with you?

595
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:26,382
Can.

596
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:42,431
Very funny, Frank.

597
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,301
Why not take it to talk?

598
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:48,437
I love this place.

599
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:54,206
Ever since that cheesy god?

600
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:57,302
The confessed to me?

601
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:00,374
Lm away. I have something to tell you.

602
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,343
Say.

603
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:08,491
I will quit.

604
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,453
Course.

605
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:16,465
Kidding?

606
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,241
Really?

607
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:27,476
Why would you want to quit?

608
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:31,403
Frank, he just killed two guys.

609
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,440
1 So great bargain.

610
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,287
I want to star?

611
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:41,357
I do not.

612
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:44,417
I know. I also do not want him to do so.

613
00:57:45,395 --> 00:57:47,420
That's what I want to say to him.

614
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,491
I just went over.
What happened?

615
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:57,465
Nothing. Just...
I do not like this future.

616
00:57:58,508 --> 00:58:03,468
I ruin the nostalgic,
do crazy things.

617
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:13,319
I do not know. It's as if I do not leave now
I'll do something stupid.

618
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:16,358
It's time to put this back then.

619
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,463
Favor but I still do not understand.

620
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,300
Do you want to come back as this honest?

621
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:29,371
- Is the goal.
- It will ruin our friendship.

622
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:32,339
- I know what will happen right?
- What's that?

623
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:39,380
I think I will visit,
dressed as Santa's bringing gifts for his children...

624
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:42,246
Then they will call me uncle.

625
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:48,288
Then will come when trouble occurs, Frank.
Since we will no longer be the same again.

626
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:53,423
So, why do not you try doing what I'm doing?

627
00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:56,465
So I'm doing a very good job of this already.
You too.

628
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:02,429
This is the end. Why I will withdraw.

629
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:10,309
I was very disappointed.
Do you remember when he asked me to do the same.

630
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:17,480
He had left  all in the mind.
He ​​is the latest build.

631
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:19,516
What do you want from me? I owe you.

632
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:26,360
I wish he
carefully recalculate his plan to not regret later.

633
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:28,453
What are you talking about? I have no plan at all.

634
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:36,328
Sometimes his actions will lead him to the path 1

635
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:43,342
What can I say?

636
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,448
Good luck, Frank.

637
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,387
Thank you.

638
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,249
Good luck.

639
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:03,431
But if something happens I will not run
Dum cleans you.

640
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:13,333
In the legal world, when he became a suspect
1 business ngech he just went bankrupt.

641
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:18,311
You could lose the license, reputation, property
. At most take home.

642
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:22,274
In my profession, often lose their lives.

643
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:25,445
So have a plan B is very important.

644
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:30,248
1 exit strategy.
My escape is Ashley.

645
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:33,386
Being alive  1
normal life free from all this.

646
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:38,262
I've always saving money.
Soon, I will be able to retire.

647
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:42,430
Maybe I'll remember, but once
action and excitement, but I will live.

648
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:47,242
And there may be more children.
1 3-bedroom house with a lawn,

649
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:52,373
and 1  pool. Where in the suburbs.
That would be my blessing.

650
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,450
Thank you. As my paradise.

651
01:00:56,519 --> 01:01:01,320
Listen  Frank, I'm sorry, I did not
lately sympathize with him.

652
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:06,258
- I know you have much to worry about in the beginning...
- Do not. Do not apologize.

653
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:09,231
Okay?

654
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,235
Summary neck you got you, you bastard.

655
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:37,512
- How are you boss?
- How you doing?

656
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,488
Fine. I in?

657
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:41,457
No, sorry, I was not invited.

658
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:48,297
Have fun.

659
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:25,264
Calm down, I know she's not all flowers.

660
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:31,240
Respect each other at all.

661
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:44,242
- Hey, no offense intended...
- Did you say that?

662
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:48,390
I am Jack Reiley.

663
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:56,457
- Jack is my name.
- Okay.

664
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,298
Why not go somewhere else to play?

665
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:03,338
He is Frank right?

666
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:11,278
What about the police?
Yes.

667
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:15,350
Now I'm off work then.

668
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:20,445
Really?

669
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:27,319
It's just work.

670
01:04:29,398 --> 01:04:31,366
I guess.

671
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:38,362
- So Reiley police...
- As inspection.

672
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:40,475
Really?

673
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:43,474
- How do you know me?
- I have inquired around here.

674
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:46,281
I want to meet you.

675
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,318
Then he met  Time.

676
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:56,391
What's this?

677
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:59,394
I have enough all you know?

678
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:04,329
- Money, women.
- I own the little brother to us, okay?

679
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:10,505
Come on.

680
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:15,433
- Hey!
- Mongolia's beautiful.

681
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:21,250
If I will not choose to become a police officer.

682
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,350
Then discarded.

683
01:05:23,352 --> 01:05:25,411
Maybe I should, but I kept thinking.

684
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:29,355
Pension...
This place burns hot right hands.

685
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:34,320
Everything I do is for dinner only.

686
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:36,465
Nor  aristocratic anything.

687
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:42,363
Yeah, amazing really. You buy from?

688
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:45,474
- Not mine.

01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:05,392
Not it? Do not remember anything?

693
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:09,498
Anyway he also died.

694
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:15,499
Why do not always go to?
He ​​made me fall inspired too.

695
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:18,499
Why? I think I caught him coming stars?

696
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:24,268
Why would I do that?
I know everything about him.

697
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:28,350
I know where you live, what time you wake up.

698
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:31,444
Knowing the toilet when he went.

699
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:35,518
And the beautiful girl he had met before coming here

01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,418

01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:43,298

My money .

01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:01,375

What are you talking about? $ 1000...

01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:49,459
To see, how much will this cost?

716
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:54,259
Dear inspector, for his mouth shut?

717
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:58,337

Okay?

756
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:23,337
OK, but when you find yourself losing control,

757
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:27,308
Just forget about the case and walked away.

758
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:29,477
Yes.

759
01:12:31,447 --> 01:12:33,415
Everything will be alright.

01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:44,519

762
01:13:14,356 --> 01:13:16,324
So Frankie, threatening him as well.

763
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:18,493
To him is not good.

764
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:23,398
I want to go to Mexico too.

765
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:39,247
What about you?

766
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,218
Um...

767
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:48,288
I like Mexico.

768
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:51,226
Let me make this clear,

769
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:58,358
He robbed,

770
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,459
then they took his gun and shot him in the hand.

771
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:05,400
What are you doing in this place?

772
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:09,277
That's where they put me.

773
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:12,347
So he kidnapped again.

774
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:16,317
Tell me how many names?

775
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:21,256
3.

776
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:25,450
- 3? White, black or latin?
- I have already said in the report.

777
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:29,363
Jack, with cocaine in his blood.

778
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:34,492
And 1 more cocaine in his jacket pocket.

779
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:41,341
I do not have any explanation, he also vowed
not tell me about the guy robbed.

780
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:47,313
If you have addiction problems, the Department can help you.

781
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:54,478
- Reiley Damn, he should tell me.
- The report is enough.

782
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:59,349
Okay, if you insist.

783
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:04,331
- He is suspended without pay indefinitely.
- She can not do that.

784
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:09,436
We know each other 20 years ago,
before she went next door to the boss.

785
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,307
I find it difficult to do much less then.

786
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,482
Deborah Sorry, I did not mean it.

787
01:15:21,283 --> 01:15:23,376
I just need a few more days.

788
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:30,384
I am doing one big case,
then everything will be clear only.

789
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:35,293
Ministry of Internal Affairs is investigating him that Jack.

790
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:40,491
I do not like him, but the superior data
eyeing him too. I give up then.

791
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:45,337
If I were you I would make one good lawyer.

792
01:16:34,389 --> 01:16:37,358
Since losing his gun and badge to put here.

793
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:40,395
Kidding me?

794
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,398
Look like I'm kidding?

795
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:48,301
I want to know who has a gun to rob
police, shot in his hand

796
01:16:48,403 --> 01:16:53,431
- And then still alive to tell.
- Life is full of crazy but, just look at him.

797
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:57,478
You know what I think?
I think I know who had shot him.

798
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:03,308
We also know he will not open up.
So stick your hand eczema is also available now.

799
01:17:03,385 --> 01:17:05,410
I do not care what you think.

800
01:17:06,254 --> 01:17:09,382
- I can not remember why I made the police?
- I shall have stars?

801
01:17:09,491 --> 01:17:17,227
Maybe he likes head 80 thousand 1 year,
wandering around the city running them shot in the butt

802
01:17:17,332 --> 01:17:20,233
- Work that.
- You're so weird.

803
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:25,268
Every self-righteous.
You think you are making a difference how?

804
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:30,275
No, he did not clean up the drug.
Once started 1 month 3 months others emerge.

805
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:35,340


806
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:39,310
True work is this funny. Look around to see.

807
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:42,313
Look at the truth. Although the initial goal of
he is, he is only failure.

808
01:17:42,524 --> 01:17:48,326
I just want to make enough to retire.
Escape to the tropics this place somehow.

809
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:51,263
Anywhere except here.

810
01:17:52,267 --> 01:17:57,295
My first case...
There is also one addict mother.

811
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:02,240
She was a seizure, but the crying baby
stirring constantly.

812
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:12,318
The bitch is positive that coach inserting
rag into her mouth to figure it shut.

813
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:18,452
When I arrived, the child was dead, his mother is
overdose is that I can not do anything.

814
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:25,400
In the beginning, my goal is
save the world, but after 20 years,

815
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:31,461
I just want to stop people like him to

Until then, Sam staggered around the matted surface.

01:20:59,487 --> 01:21:02,285
Cosmetic surgery will not be saved.

01:21:04,392 --> 01:21:10,490
Step back, do not let it show...

923
01:29:07,542 --> 01:29:09,510
Stay there!

924
01:29:11,512 --> 01:29:13,480
Do you hear me?

925
01:29:14,415 --> 01:29:17,282
I know, I know. Do not tell.

926
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:32,458
Do not, do that...

927
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,408
Agent Royce here, where is the relief?

928
01:29:59,293 --> 01:30:01,488
Look at me. Just do what I say.

929
01:30:02,263 --> 01:30:04,231
Just follow, will be okay.

930
01:30:04,432 --> 01:30:06,400
Come on, get up.

931
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:13,207
Okay, let's go.

932
01:30:13,474 --> 01:30:15,442
I catch her then.

933
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:17,478
Keep going.

934
01:30:20,515 --> 01:30:22,483
Stop.

935
01:30:26,387 --> 01:30:28,412
Go away, go away from here.

936
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:31,258
Go away.

937
01:33:11,352 --> 01:33:13,320
So you will not come to Costa Rica where eh.

938
01:33:13,387 --> 01:33:15,355
Bastard.

939
01:33:49,256 --> 01:33:51,224
I've calculated everything.

940
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:53,259
But I fail.

941
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:54,454
Is my fault.

942
01:33:54,495 --> 01:33:56,463
I should have known before.

943
01:33:57,465 --> 01:34:00,400
I said "I would rather do business with sharks

944
01:34:01,268 --> 01:34:02,394
rather than with fools."

945
01:34:02,403 --> 01:34:04,371
At least I know what they want.

946
01:34:05,339 --> 01:34:07,466
I understand the way they used to sabotage me,

947
01:34:08,509 --> 01:34:11,239
With idiots, you can not measure.

948
01:34:12,279 --> 01:34:14,406
I would rather do business with flood debris of this world rather than

949
01:34:14,515 --> 01:34:19,316
Flood said police are not corrupt control addiction.

950
01:34:20,521 --> 01:34:22,489
Supposed to kill him when I get a chance.

951
01:34:23,524 --> 01:34:25,492
Now Ashley, Eddie,

952
01:34:26,293 --> 01:34:28,261
the girls...

953
01:34:28,262 --> 01:34:30,230
Dead already.

954
01:34:31,232 --> 01:34:33,200
Money and all.

955
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:35,302
Plan A fails.

956
01:34:36,303 --> 01:34:38,271
Plan B as well.

957
01:34:41,442 --> 01:34:44,275
Maybe it's time to start planning C
