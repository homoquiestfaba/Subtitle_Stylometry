2
00:02:07,018 --> 00:02:10,078
-The a The army is of to war.
-The a on the march again.

3
00:02:19,997 --> 00:02:21,191
They're of to war again.

4
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,696
You know who's leading the troops?

5
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,630
Sir Tu'an Gu, surely.

6
00:02:27,505 --> 00:02:29,530
No. General Zhao Shuo has taken over.

7
00:02:31,843 --> 00:02:35,438
l was taking his wife's pulse
when l heard the news.

8
00:02:49,227 --> 00:02:50,626
She's pretty.

9
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:53,094
Very pretty.

10
00:02:54,732 --> 00:02:56,825
You took the pulse of Lady Zhuangji?

11
00:02:57,134 --> 00:02:58,158
No way.

12
00:02:58,736 --> 00:02:59,634
lt's true.

13
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:02,229
You saw she's pregnant?

14
00:03:03,241 --> 00:03:06,176
They couldn’t work out when she's due.
So they called me in.

15
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,744
She shouldn't be riding in a carriage

16
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,543
lt could hurt the baby.

17
00:03:13,851 --> 00:03:16,513
l said l'd treat you when l reoovered.

18
00:03:16,921 --> 00:03:18,479
Let's go for a drink.

19
00:03:18,556 --> 00:03:20,922
My wife's due as well.
l should stay with her.

20
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,161
After the birth, drinks are on me.

21
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:26,654
Thank you.

22
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:34,130
Grand Councilor Zhao Dun!

23
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:39,271
General Zhao Shuo!

24
00:03:45,182 --> 00:03:47,810
Lady Zhuangji!

25
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,915
What's my sister doing here?

26
00:03:54,825 --> 00:03:59,194
A woman of the royal family
is about to give birth to a Zhao.

27
00:03:59,764 --> 00:04:02,665
once he's born...
l'll be his uncle

28
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,092
Zhao Dun is Grand Councilor

29
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,664
His son is of to war,
and will return a hero.

30
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,634
How enviable!

31
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,104
Even l'm envious!

32
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:21,851
lf l'd known...

33
00:04:22,753 --> 00:04:24,948
l'd have married her to you.

34
00:04:30,294 --> 00:04:33,058
Then l'd be jealous of you.

35
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,168
Go to battle, fine.

36
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:42,972
Why put your heavily pregnant wife
on show, for the whole town to see?

37
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:48,073
A woman about to give birth,
seeing her husband of to war...

38
00:04:48,212 --> 00:04:50,077
Who wouldn't be moved?

39
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,915
And she's the elder sister of the king.

40
00:04:54,185 --> 00:04:56,176
lsn't it really just telling the world

41
00:04:56,287 --> 00:04:58,084
that the Zhaos are in charge?

42
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:01,886
Brother-The ain-The claw
l've come to see you of.

43
00:05:03,227 --> 00:05:06,060
Zhao Shuo, l can see...

44
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,026
Sister cares more about you
than she does about me.

45
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:13,932
The general is of to war,
and all you do is joke around.

46
00:05:13,971 --> 00:05:17,907
Everyone's saying
you should be in command

47
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:23,107
The king's sister
should've been married to you.

48
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:28,116
You tease.

49
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:31,015
They forgot my contribution long ago.

50
00:05:34,859 --> 00:05:37,225
When you return,
we'll drink to your victory

51
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:38,922
l'll prepare the wine.

52
00:05:39,196 --> 00:05:41,391
The Grand Councilor
will prepare the wine.

53
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,725
-The a Sir Tu'an.
-The a Present.

54
00:05:43,768 --> 00:05:46,362
When Zhao Shuo returns victorious,
what will you give him?

55
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:57,211
Felicitations
on your imminent fatherhood.

56
00:06:01,085 --> 00:06:03,178
You, Milady,

57
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,018
are the most fortunate of women.

58
00:06:12,363 --> 00:06:15,958
Who'd have thought his very first battle
would go so well?

59
00:06:17,201 --> 00:06:19,032
Wasn't that your hope?

60
00:06:20,905 --> 00:06:22,099
Why aren't they here yet?

61
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:26,371
M'Lord, when General Zhao
rode into town,

62
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,210
the townspeople thronged to welcome him.
They'll be some time.

63
00:06:30,281 --> 00:06:32,875
We've won! We've won!

64
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:34,817
Grand Councilor!

65
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:39,846
The Grand Councilor is suggesting
that M'Lord hurry over there as well.

66
00:06:40,725 --> 00:06:41,714
l'm not going.

67
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,455
Tell Zhao Dun we shall wait.
However late they are.

68
00:06:44,762 --> 00:06:46,696
We have a gift for him.

69
00:06:57,842 --> 00:07:00,072
M'Lord, they're here.

70
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:03,444
-The a l'll go welcome them.
-The a Good.

71
00:07:26,971 --> 00:07:30,839
There's an assassin!
Hurry, protest the Grand Councilor!

72
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,221
Take this.

73
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:47,115
Bravo on your victory, General.

74
00:07:55,366 --> 00:07:58,335
So this is how you reward my son
when he returns a victor?

75
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,338
Luckily it only hit my horse's eye.

76
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,240
This is surely a misunderstanding.

77
00:08:08,546 --> 00:08:11,879
We can testify that Sir Tu'an
didn't mean it.

78
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,879
Go on, apologize to the Grand Councilor

79
00:08:17,388 --> 00:08:20,050
l apologize.

80
00:08:20,157 --> 00:08:22,921
That was nothing...

81
00:08:23,427 --> 00:08:26,794
compared to leading the king astray.

82
00:08:28,465 --> 00:08:31,025
lt was only your horse.

83
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:47,049
Zhao Dun shouldn't have done that.

84
00:08:50,588 --> 00:08:51,850
This is my punishment.

85
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:40,690
The talisman oirole
painted on his skin...

86
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:43,326
contains cinnabar and oxblood.

87
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:48,165
These insects love that smell.

88
00:10:49,673 --> 00:10:51,106
ls this the best method?

89
00:10:51,141 --> 00:10:56,579
What could be better
than framing them for the crime?

90
00:10:58,315 --> 00:11:00,044
How can l thank you?

91
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,684
There are 300 in the Zhao clan

92
00:11:07,157 --> 00:11:09,421
You tell me.

93
00:11:24,341 --> 00:11:25,672
You're over forty.

94
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:28,201
How'd you manage to have a boy?

95
00:11:28,746 --> 00:11:30,145
Don't you get it?

96
00:11:31,515 --> 00:11:33,346
We'd have had one earlier if we could

97
00:11:34,218 --> 00:11:35,685
That it happened now...

98
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,180
is fate.

99
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,584
ls there some pill? l want one too.

100
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:45,358
Pill?

101
00:11:45,696 --> 00:11:47,527
Having a boy is just fate.

102
00:11:48,298 --> 00:11:51,199
She was soared
she wouldn't give me a boy.

103
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:54,361
l said don't worry...
And whoosh, out he came!

104
00:11:54,538 --> 00:11:55,732
l wasn't wrong, was l?

105
00:11:57,441 --> 00:11:59,671
The next will be a boy too.

106
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,099
Here's your medicine

107
00:12:04,448 --> 00:12:06,245
That'd be my wife. Take your time.

108
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:17,217
Three things.

109
00:12:17,795 --> 00:12:19,023
Tell me.

110
00:12:19,396 --> 00:12:21,227
First, l want fish soup.

111
00:12:22,232 --> 00:12:23,256
Easy.

112
00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:25,428
The seoond?

113
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:30,700
These names -The a l don't like any of them.

114
00:12:31,508 --> 00:12:33,305
You don't think any of them

115
00:12:34,144 --> 00:12:36,374
is good enough for our son.

116
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,712
l'll work on it.

117
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,044
There's one more thing.

118
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:48,354
Hand out 'birth eggs' to all and sundry,
and people will laugh at you.

119
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:51,628
Who doesn't know by now
that you've had a son?

120
00:12:59,136 --> 00:13:01,468
l have a feeling Lady Zhuangji's due.

121
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:03,766
l've never killed a woman.

122
00:13:04,608 --> 00:13:06,838
Even one with a Zhao ohild in her belly?

123
00:13:07,144 --> 00:13:08,475
l won't kill Lady Zhuangji.

124
00:13:08,612 --> 00:13:11,581
What about her ohild?

125
00:13:13,117 --> 00:13:14,311
Do we kill it?

126
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:30,857
Zhao Dun,

127
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,300
to oelebrate our viotory

128
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,132
and oongratulate your son,

129
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:36,801
what wine have you brought?

130
00:13:37,141 --> 00:13:39,336
Five Color God of State Wine.

131
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,740
lt represents the hopes
of all your people.

132
00:13:44,248 --> 00:13:45,237
Drink it...

133
00:13:45,582 --> 00:13:48,278
and let it inspire you to be

134
00:13:48,785 --> 00:13:51,845
a wise and virtuous ruler.

135
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:55,884
lt's just wine. What's it got to do
with wisdom and virtue?

136
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:59,323
lf l don't drink it,
it seems l wrong the people.

137
00:13:59,563 --> 00:14:03,226
lf l drink but l'm not wise,
l wrong the people.

138
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,296
So tell me, should l drink it or not?

139
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,405
-The a l won't drink.
-The a Don't drink it then.

140
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:10,633
You must drink it.

141
00:14:11,742 --> 00:14:14,870
l also have a gift for M'Lord.

142
00:14:16,346 --> 00:14:19,907
lt is also to remind M'Lord to be

143
00:14:20,584 --> 00:14:21,881
a wise and virtuous ruler.

144
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:24,513
You're oonspiring to make me unhappy.

145
00:14:24,555 --> 00:14:25,749
What is this gift of yours?

146
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:27,154
A Divine Beast of the Western Regions.

147
00:14:29,626 --> 00:14:31,287
Divine Beast?

148
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,460
lt's just a dog.

149
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:36,699
True.

150
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:38,632
lt's a dog.

151
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:39,636
What's so speoial about it?

152
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,297
lt oan tell a patriot from a traitor.

153
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,737
M'Lord,

154
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,502
though the palaoe is large...

155
00:14:48,445 --> 00:14:50,345
there's no room for an animal.

156
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,941
Suoh a big plaoe -The a
of oourse there's room for a dog.

157
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,914
Bring it in for us to see.

00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,800
Wise indeed!

159
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:27,747
Don't be angry.

00:15:28,986 --> 00:15:30,476
lt's just a dog.

161
00:15:31,788 --> 00:15:33,346
Don't be ridioulous!

162
00:15:34,825 --> 00:15:36,486
You don't need a sword

163
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,752
to deal with a dog.

164
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,804
Take it away.

165
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,229
Take it away.

166
00:16:20,904 --> 00:16:23,737

A boy.

170
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:33,279
Zhao Shuo, hurry, go see them.

171
00:16:40,357 --> 00:16:41,790
Felioitations, General.

172
00:16:42,926 --> 00:16:44,621
You're a father at last.

173
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:48,021
lf your son had lived...

174
00:16:48,332 --> 00:16:49,856
you'd be a granddad by now.

175
00:16:58,909 --> 00:16:59,807
Let's drink!

176
00:17:00,077 --> 00:17:01,908
We want the red one.

177
00:17:04,514 --> 00:17:05,811

M'Lady, oan you guess
why she won't let me do this?

180
00:17:18,028 --> 00:17:20,087
Your wife is surely thinking

188
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:50,745
The wine's poisoned.

189

the Zhao ohild.

362
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:10,971
By the way,

363
00:39:13,776 --> 00:39:17,177
our boy has a name.
Lady Zhuangji named him...

364
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,769
Cheng Bo.

365
00:39:19,782 --> 00:39:22,216
She said it signifies vigor and nobility.

366
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,217
Call him Bo'er.

367
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:29,084
That's all. Go get ready.

368
00:39:53,148 --> 00:39:55,275
Heaven proteots the Zhaos.

369
00:39:58,821 --> 00:40:02,188
Sir, l entrust you with the ohild and my wife.
Thank you, sir.

370
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:04,452
l'm not muoh for oeremony.

371
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:08,860
But for saving this ohild,
l'll make an exoeption.

372
00:40:09,832 --> 00:40:10,821
Cheng Ying.

373
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,699
This is on behalf of the Zhaos.

374
00:41:01,383 --> 00:41:02,975
Anyone there?

375
00:41:04,286 --> 00:41:06,413
Sir, l want to go home.

376
00:41:06,989 --> 00:41:09,787
We'll take the boy to my plaoe first.

377
00:41:15,864 --> 00:41:17,126
Master has returned.

378
00:41:25,507 --> 00:41:26,371
We're here.

379
00:41:27,209 --> 00:41:29,074
l've lied to you, Sir Gongsun.

380
00:41:30,479 --> 00:41:32,140
He's my ohild.

381
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,511
l gave the Zhao boy to the soldiers.

382
00:41:37,052 --> 00:41:39,919
Give the ohildren water.

383
00:41:40,455 --> 00:41:43,322
Give the ohildren water.

384
00:41:44,226 --> 00:41:47,423
lf it were me, l wouldn't give up
my own ohild either.

385
00:41:47,462 --> 00:41:51,398
But all the babies in town
are with Tu'an Gu now.

386
00:41:51,466 --> 00:41:53,024
So your boy...

387
00:41:53,068 --> 00:41:55,536
has beoome the one they're looking for.

388
00:41:55,571 --> 00:41:58,039
l'll go tell Sir Tu'an now that he's my son.

389
00:41:58,073 --> 00:42:00,337
That won't save him.

390
00:42:01,076 --> 00:42:04,443
Tu'an won't oare whioh is whioh.
He'll kill them both...

391
00:42:05,013 --> 00:42:06,139
just to be sure.

392
00:42:10,285 --> 00:42:12,515
Then l'll take him home and hide him.

393
00:42:12,588 --> 00:42:16,024
Hide a newborn?

394
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,520
-The a He just has to ory.
-The a l have medioine.

395
00:42:19,862 --> 00:42:21,386
He won't make a sound.

396
00:42:29,104 --> 00:42:33,234
You and your baby oan hide
inside the oompound wall.

397
00:42:37,613 --> 00:42:40,946
Will everyone please stand.

398
00:42:43,986 --> 00:42:46,318
Whoever took the Zhao ohild...

399
00:42:46,622 --> 00:42:49,250
is oausing trouble for everyone.

400
00:42:50,325 --> 00:42:51,917
Don't worry.

401
00:42:52,427 --> 00:42:55,396
Your ohildren are fine.

402
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,331
They're being fed rioe porridge.

403
00:42:59,534 --> 00:43:01,968
Like you l'm hoping...

404
00:43:04,573 --> 00:43:06,598
whoever took the Zhao ohild...

405
00:43:07,943 --> 00:43:11,879
will appear here by 3 A.M.

406
00:43:12,481 --> 00:43:14,210
lf he doesn't?

407
00:43:14,483 --> 00:43:16,474
Does suoh a person exist who,

408
00:43:17,986 --> 00:43:21,251
to save one ohild,
would saorifioe 100 others?

409
00:43:25,961 --> 00:43:30,489
l, Tu'an Gu, will by 3 A.M.,
find this person.

410
00:43:30,532 --> 00:43:32,557
Thank you, sir!

411
00:43:44,046 --> 00:43:46,139
When we oheoked the names,

412
00:43:46,214 --> 00:43:51,083
we found all parents present,
exoept those of one boy.

413
00:43:51,553 --> 00:43:53,578
Do you know whose ohild it is?

414
00:43:54,189 --> 00:43:58,148
The boy belongs to a dootor
oalled Cheng Ying.

415
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:03,027
Just before you returned,
he finally showed up.

416
00:44:03,999 --> 00:44:05,125
Dootor?

417
00:44:06,635 --> 00:44:08,193
And the mother?

418
00:44:08,603 --> 00:44:12,630
No. l must tell my husband
we haven't left town.

419
00:44:13,608 --> 00:44:16,168
otherwise, at 3 A.M.,
to save the other ohildren

420
00:44:16,211 --> 00:44:17,235
he'll definitely tell them

421
00:44:18,513 --> 00:44:22,244
the Zhao boy was taken out of town
by Sir Gongsun.

422
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,685
But we're still here.

423
00:44:26,488 --> 00:44:28,956
lf you tell him we're here...

424
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:31,217
your ohild will be safe.

425
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:36,156
But the two of you will have to witness
the slaughter of a hundred infants.

426
00:44:36,498 --> 00:44:38,363
one hundred will die so yours oan live.

427
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:39,695
Could you bear that?

428
00:44:40,602 --> 00:44:42,467
They'll definitely oome looking.

429
00:44:43,505 --> 00:44:47,305
What sort of mother abandons
her newborn infant?

430
00:44:47,576 --> 00:44:49,510
Something must be holding her up,

431
00:44:50,445 --> 00:44:51,742
don't you think?

432
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:55,173
Perhaps it's not their ohild.

433
00:44:56,084 --> 00:44:57,449
What's the dootor's name?

434
00:44:57,552 --> 00:44:58,712
Cheng Ying.

435
00:45:05,761 --> 00:45:07,592
You hide in this wall.

436
00:45:08,263 --> 00:45:10,128
l'll handle them.

437
00:45:10,732 --> 00:45:12,666
l'll tell Tu'an Gu

438
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:16,198
l took the Zhao ohild outside the town.

439
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,578
Heaven has preserved the Zhaos.

440
00:45:29,284 --> 00:45:32,310
But hasn't been kind to the two in hiding.

441
00:45:32,788 --> 00:45:34,619
You've not had it easy either.

442
00:45:42,697 --> 00:45:45,188
Send the servants away.

443
00:45:59,748 --> 00:46:01,443
lt's time.

444
00:46:02,417 --> 00:46:04,385
The one l'm waiting for...

445
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,682
is still not here.

446
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:23,598
Whioh one of you is Cheng Ying?

447
00:46:23,638 --> 00:46:25,071
l'm Cheng Ying.

448
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,414
ls this your ohild?

449
00:46:41,223 --> 00:46:42,315
lt is.

450
00:46:48,697 --> 00:46:49,686
Come.

451
00:47:02,477 --> 00:47:03,876
He's not your ohild.

452
00:47:04,146 --> 00:47:06,706
He is my ohild, sir.
There's a birthmark on his forehead.

453
00:47:10,218 --> 00:47:11,776
Look.

454
00:47:13,588 --> 00:47:16,421
Say he really is yours.

455
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:19,787
The other parents got here long ago.

456
00:47:20,562 --> 00:47:23,463
Why were you the only one missing?

457
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:27,367
What kept you?

458
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,540
This is the Zhao ohild, isn't it?

459
00:47:33,575 --> 00:47:35,668
He's not the Zhao ohild.
He's my son, really.

460
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:37,143
l believe you.

461
00:47:40,549 --> 00:47:42,176
But it's already 3 A.M.

462
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:44,350
More than 100 ohildren must die...

463
00:47:45,854 --> 00:47:47,913
unless l find the Zhao boy.

464
00:47:54,296 --> 00:47:55,228
Sir, l oonfess...

465
00:47:57,199 --> 00:47:59,724
l'm the one who took away
the Zhao ohild.

466
00:48:00,302 --> 00:48:02,167
l delivered him.

467
00:48:02,204 --> 00:48:03,671
That's not right either.

468
00:48:05,607 --> 00:48:08,371
lf she lived through the birth...

469
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:11,904
Lady Zhuangji would have fled
with him herself.

470
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,473
Why would she give him
to someone like you?

471
00:48:17,285 --> 00:48:19,879
She said only if she died
looking pregnant

472
00:48:19,921 --> 00:48:21,889
would l be able to esoape.

473
00:48:36,304 --> 00:48:38,465
Who'd you give him to?

474
00:48:40,408 --> 00:48:41,306
l oan't say.

475
00:48:42,944 --> 00:48:43,933
You must.

476
00:48:46,615 --> 00:48:49,516
Then l'll tell everyone out there...

477
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:52,819
their ohildren's murderer

478
00:48:52,854 --> 00:48:57,689
has been found.

479
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:04,765
l gave the boy to Sir Gongsun.

480
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:21,576
Your ohildren... may live.

481
00:49:59,487 --> 00:50:00,784
Dismount!

482
00:50:32,721 --> 00:50:35,019
The Zhao boy is somewhere
in this house.

483
00:50:37,092 --> 00:50:40,755
l was ourious to know who'd hide him.

484
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,923
You should've guessed.

485
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,964
But the Zhao ohild is already
far away from here.

486
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:52,003
l advise you to let him go.

487
00:50:52,607 --> 00:50:54,802
lf you do...
you'll release yourself as well.

488
00:50:56,077 --> 00:50:58,511
The Zhao boy is surely here somewhere.

489
00:51:00,115 --> 00:51:02,606
When Lady Zhuangji gave him to me,

490
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:06,120
she said let him grow up
never to know his parents...

491
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,345
or his enemies.

492
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:10,824
To let him live an ordinary life.

493
00:51:11,593 --> 00:51:13,959
Bring him here.
Let me have a look.

494
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:17,388
l'll let you take him far away.

495
00:51:18,466 --> 00:51:19,797
l told you,

496
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:23,561
he's already far away from here.

497
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:28,471
Well, l shan't be polite.

498
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:44,024
The louder the better.

499
00:52:20,128 --> 00:52:23,120
Sir Tu'an, Sir Tu'an!

500
00:52:29,003 --> 00:52:31,528
l'll never let you take the ohild.

501
00:52:31,639 --> 00:52:33,197
Sir Tu'an. Sir Tu'an!

502
00:52:47,121 --> 00:52:49,612
Lady Zhuangji was right to trust you.

503
00:52:52,594 --> 00:52:54,824
l stayed loyal to the Zhaos.

504
00:53:48,216 --> 00:53:49,911
Give me the boy.

505
00:53:58,026 --> 00:53:59,755
Please, spare the boy.

506
00:53:59,794 --> 00:54:01,989
l betrayed him.
Let me die in his plaoe.

507
00:54:02,897 --> 00:54:04,797
Who said l'm going to kill him?

508
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,894
Just let me have a look.

509
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:09,525
l oan't.

510
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:13,629
Who are you?

511
00:54:13,675 --> 00:54:14,937
She's my wife.

512
00:54:16,911 --> 00:54:20,039
Why are you holding a baby
who's not your own?

513
00:54:28,289 --> 00:54:30,280
Beoause his parents are dead.

514
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:36,754
lf you don't give him to me,
you'll foroe me to kill him.

515
00:54:47,008 --> 00:54:47,997
Give him to me.

516
00:54:50,244 --> 00:54:51,176
Give him to me.

517
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,613
Sir Tu'an.

518
00:55:04,892 --> 00:55:06,826
Just for a moment then.

519
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:12,785
Next.

520
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:15,827
Cheng Ying. Take your son.

521
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:08,367
Tu'an Gu, how oan l
make everyone fear me?

522
00:58:09,076 --> 00:58:10,373
Easy.

523
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,049
Remember the name of everyone
in your oourt.

524
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:17,880
So many names -The a
l have to remember them all?

525
00:58:17,919 --> 00:58:19,216
Every single one.

526
00:58:20,188 --> 00:58:24,249
Beoause any one of them
oould turn against you.

527
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,358
Do you have enemies?

528
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:30,488
Not anymore.

529
00:58:31,365 --> 00:58:33,390
How oan l avoid having enemies?

530
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:41,104
Tomorrow you'll hold oourt for the first time.
What should you do?

531
00:58:47,014 --> 00:58:48,845
-The a Tu'an Gu.
-The a Yes.

532
00:58:48,883 --> 00:58:51,283
What is this virtue they oall benevolenoe?

533
00:58:53,254 --> 00:58:55,814
lt's one of the highest moral virtues.

534
00:58:56,357 --> 00:58:57,824
lt means...

535
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:01,260
be a good person.

536
00:59:21,582 --> 00:59:22,879
lt's so sad.

537
00:59:23,217 --> 00:59:25,014
Raising the kid on his own.

538
00:59:47,241 --> 00:59:49,368
Hurry. Don't look.

539
00:59:59,954 --> 01:00:00,978
Hold on.

540
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,051
l don't want to see you.

541
01:00:06,427 --> 01:00:11,330
What do these blood feuds
have to do with a oommoner like you...

542
01:00:11,933 --> 01:00:13,525
to make you save the Zhao ohild?

543
01:00:13,567 --> 01:00:15,626
You let me get away.

544
01:00:16,037 --> 01:00:19,029
l knew that the ohild was doomed.

545
01:00:21,475 --> 01:00:23,443
But l regret letting you go.

546
01:00:24,445 --> 01:00:26,538
l thought they'd fled,

547
01:00:27,615 --> 01:00:32,143
or l'd never have led Tu'an
to Gongsun's home.

548
01:00:41,629 --> 01:00:43,119
l heard...

549
01:00:45,066 --> 01:00:47,591
that the woman who died with the boy...

550
01:00:49,337 --> 01:00:50,929
was your wife.

551
01:00:54,241 --> 01:00:56,334
l'll go make up your presoription.

552
01:00:57,545 --> 01:00:59,410
Your poor ohild.

553
01:01:00,214 --> 01:01:02,273
Just born and he loses his mother.

554
01:01:22,636 --> 01:01:24,194
Take your medioine and go.

555
01:01:24,238 --> 01:01:27,002
Give me some poison.

556
01:01:28,075 --> 01:01:30,134
Killing him would be too easy.

557
01:01:31,245 --> 01:01:33,509
l want him to live a life worse than death.

558
01:01:34,749 --> 01:01:36,614
You want to poison him?

559
01:01:37,118 --> 01:01:39,245
l'm a healer. l don't do that.

560
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:44,124
Don't touoh it.

561
01:01:44,692 --> 01:01:45,716
lt'll get better by itself.

562
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:49,721
But a life worse than death?

563
01:01:51,365 --> 01:01:53,424
Look olosely -The a who's this boy?

564
01:02:26,167 --> 01:02:29,136
From now on, use the baok door.
Ring the bell. l'll hear it.

565
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:36,532
Cheng Ying.

566
01:02:42,283 --> 01:02:43,807
This bow...

567
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:45,541
is for your son.

568
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:56,655
Who was the boy who died?

569
01:02:58,332 --> 01:03:00,061
My son.

570
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:02,767
lt was fate.

571
01:03:02,803 --> 01:03:04,134
Fate.

572
01:03:08,742 --> 01:03:11,404
l will raise him well.

573
01:03:12,146 --> 01:03:14,444
He will avenge my son.

574
01:03:15,216 --> 01:03:16,444
How long do you have to wait?

575
01:03:16,484 --> 01:03:18,213
As long as l have to.

576
01:03:24,792 --> 01:03:26,487
When he's older...

577
01:03:27,862 --> 01:03:30,797
l'll take him to Tu'an Gu

578
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,829
and reveal his identity

579
01:03:35,503 --> 01:03:37,095
and my own.

580
01:04:31,892 --> 01:04:34,224
My name is Cheng Ying.
This is Cheng Bo.

581
01:04:34,461 --> 01:04:37,157
Sir, please aooept us...

582
01:04:37,798 --> 01:04:38,730
into your retinue.

583
01:04:41,268 --> 01:04:46,331
To serve and follow
to the end of time.

584
01:04:50,244 --> 01:04:52,644
Tell me... how you helped me?

585
01:04:52,746 --> 01:04:54,805
l helped you kill one ohild...

586
01:04:55,583 --> 01:04:57,744
and save a hundred others.

587
01:05:04,225 --> 01:05:06,853
When you put it like that
it seems l owe you.

588
01:05:07,761 --> 01:05:09,228
You do.

589
01:05:23,444 --> 01:05:25,537
You saved your own boy too.

590
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:44,386
Come.

591
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:47,664
Come.

592
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:04,408
What do you say?

593
01:06:05,786 --> 01:06:07,344
Say 'Godfather'.

594
01:06:08,789 --> 01:06:09,653
Come on.

595
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:15,452
I'm going to kiII you.

596
01:06:45,059 --> 01:06:46,287
l've done it.

597
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:52,421
FATHER, SoN

598
01:06:54,935 --> 01:06:55,833
That's right.

599
01:07:10,684 --> 01:07:11,810
Bo'er,

600
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:14,446
Godfather's got two gifts for you:

601
01:07:15,356 --> 01:07:16,948
armor and a sword.

602
01:07:18,859 --> 01:07:20,884
Cheng Ying, help him with the armor.

603
01:07:22,596 --> 01:07:25,463
Without these two things,
you'll never be a man.

604
01:07:25,699 --> 01:07:26,859
He doesn't have them.

605
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:32,862
Your having them is good enough for me.

606
01:07:40,914 --> 01:07:42,973
Go up on the roof and find it.

607
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:51,722
Thank you, Godfather.

608
01:07:51,892 --> 01:07:54,725
Remember -The a
your sword is your best friend.

609
01:07:54,762 --> 01:07:56,059
l know.

610
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:57,929
-The a Jump down.
-The a No, don't.

611
01:07:58,031 --> 01:07:59,692
Bo'er, don'tjump.
Do you hear me?

612
01:08:03,003 --> 01:08:05,597
Jump. l'll oatoh you.

613
01:08:17,017 --> 01:08:17,949
Bo'er.

614
01:08:18,085 --> 01:08:20,110
l'll get you! l'll get you!

615
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:24,380
Bo'er, listen.

616
01:08:26,427 --> 01:08:27,917
Remember this advioe:

617
01:08:29,396 --> 01:08:31,489
Don't trust anyone.

618
01:08:33,434 --> 01:08:34,492
Bo'er,

619
01:08:35,803 --> 01:08:37,031
let's go home.

620
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:39,671
My sword.

621
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:52,477
Bo'er, jump.

622
01:08:53,086 --> 01:08:54,451
Dad will oatoh you.

623
01:09:20,581 --> 01:09:22,606
l didn't go to sohool either.

624
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:25,475
l'll teaoh you to read and write.

625
01:09:25,519 --> 01:09:27,043
You were poor then.

626
01:09:27,087 --> 01:09:30,716
Now you have money.
Why won't you let me go to sohool?

627
01:09:31,191 --> 01:09:33,557
l know.
You want to keep an eye on me.

628
01:09:33,594 --> 01:09:34,652
Not true.

629
01:09:37,164 --> 01:09:38,688
Pour some for your godfather.

630
01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:51,842
lf you drink wine with the medioine,
you'll never get better.

631
01:09:52,679 --> 01:09:55,773
lf you give up drinking,
you won't need the medioine.

632
01:09:57,818 --> 01:09:58,842
You'll be well again.

633
01:09:58,886 --> 01:10:00,478
Enough.

634
01:10:01,955 --> 01:10:06,051
My drinking is none of your business.
Yourjob is the medioine.

635
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:11,491
l've tested it.
Take it an hour after drinking.

636
01:10:11,565 --> 01:10:12,930
Heat it up first.

637
01:10:13,767 --> 01:10:17,567
Medioine a patient likes to take -The a
only you oould do that.

638
01:10:17,604 --> 01:10:18,866
He has medioine that oan
save anyone's life!

639
01:10:18,906 --> 01:10:21,067
-The a Rubbish.
-The a lt's true.

640
01:10:21,108 --> 01:10:23,269
And Godfather,
he won't let me go to sohool.

641
01:10:24,244 --> 01:10:25,836
We'll fine him a big oup of wine.

642
01:10:25,879 --> 01:10:27,540
l oan't -The a one sip and l'm drunk.

643
01:10:27,581 --> 01:10:30,709
He's lying. He oan drink!
And he never gets drunk.

644
01:10:35,789 --> 01:10:37,017
All right, l'll drink then.

645
01:10:46,199 --> 01:10:48,929
What'd you whisper in his ear?

646
01:10:53,974 --> 01:10:55,908
You'll find out tomorrow.

647
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:24,996
There he is!

648
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:36,242
You've been drinking?

649
01:11:36,950 --> 01:11:37,939
Yes.

650
01:11:40,621 --> 01:11:43,886
Now that you're in his retinue,
you've got good food, good wine.

651
01:11:43,924 --> 01:11:46,051
lt's quite not a bad life.

652
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:50,188
l hear you even oured his illness.

653
01:11:51,164 --> 01:11:54,133
-The a ls that true?
-The a lt is.

654
01:11:54,201 --> 01:11:57,136
lf he's taking your medioine,
oouldn't you have poisoned it?

655
01:11:59,072 --> 01:12:00,835
Wouldn't that be a good revenge?

656
01:12:02,909 --> 01:12:04,035
l told you before.

657
01:12:05,012 --> 01:12:06,104
When the boy's old enough,

658
01:12:06,146 --> 01:12:09,013
l'll take him to Tu'an...

659
01:12:09,616 --> 01:12:11,948
and tell him who we really are.

660
01:12:15,255 --> 01:12:17,883
l want them to be as olose as kin.

661
01:12:20,293 --> 01:12:22,318
Then the Zhao ohild...

662
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:25,698
will kill him with one thrust of his sword.

663
01:12:28,268 --> 01:12:30,133
Now that's revenge.

664
01:12:30,804 --> 01:12:31,998
You're dreaming.

665
01:12:33,206 --> 01:12:34,173
How old is old enough?

666
01:12:34,207 --> 01:12:36,368
When he's oapable of killing him.

667
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:39,902
What if something happens before then?

668
01:12:41,248 --> 01:12:45,048
Are you sure that when he grows up,
he'll be able to do it?

669
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:49,079
You want them to grow olose.

670
01:12:52,426 --> 01:12:54,394
lt's not fair to the boy.

671
01:12:59,766 --> 01:13:01,427
lt's very fair.

672
01:13:04,204 --> 01:13:05,193
And me?

673
01:13:08,075 --> 01:13:09,133
Eight years.

674
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:10,905
ls it fair to me?

675
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:18,410
Let me see the boy.

676
01:13:18,452 --> 01:13:20,852
Aren't you afraid your soar
will soare him?

677
01:13:21,755 --> 01:13:23,086
And he'll tell Tu'an about you?

678
01:13:23,123 --> 01:13:24,454
Aren't you afraid he'll tell Tu'an...

679
01:13:25,926 --> 01:13:29,692
that when a stranger visits,
you look him up in a dark room?

680
01:13:32,933 --> 01:13:34,696
We've a paot.

681
01:13:35,469 --> 01:13:39,997
The day after l see you,
l take him for a good meal.

682
01:13:42,242 --> 01:13:45,268
That's fine for now.
When he's a bit older,

683
01:13:45,912 --> 01:13:48,278
a bowl of noodles
won't buy obedienoe.

684
01:14:11,905 --> 01:14:14,032
Why does that man always
make you unhappy?

685
01:14:15,308 --> 01:14:17,868
l'll tell Godfather.
He'll arrest him!

686
01:14:26,353 --> 01:14:27,377
Where's Cheng Bo?

687
01:14:29,156 --> 01:14:30,748
What is it, sir?

688
01:14:31,124 --> 01:14:32,148
He's here.

689
01:14:32,959 --> 01:14:33,891
Bo'er.

690
01:14:34,127 --> 01:14:35,253
l'm here.

691
01:14:37,164 --> 01:14:38,222
Godfather.

692
01:14:38,999 --> 01:14:39,988
Bo'er.

693
01:14:42,169 --> 01:14:45,798
What you told me last night -The a
tell your dad.

694
01:14:47,207 --> 01:14:49,835
l oan't. He'll hit me.

695
01:14:55,515 --> 01:14:57,142
l won't hit you. Tell me.

696
01:14:57,918 --> 01:14:59,442
l told Godfather

697
01:14:59,519 --> 01:15:02,920
l wantjust one day
without you watohing me.

698
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:12,960
ls that all?

699
01:15:12,999 --> 01:15:14,830
No need to oall in the troops.

700
01:15:14,868 --> 01:15:16,460
Do you hear what he's saying,
Cheng Ying?

701
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:19,938
You've raised him these eight years.

702
01:15:20,874 --> 01:15:21,932
lt's not been easy.

703
01:15:23,176 --> 01:15:24,803
Have a rest today.

704
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,277
Godfather will take you to sohool.

705
01:15:29,416 --> 01:15:31,213
-The a Great!
-The a l'll go too.

706
01:15:32,085 --> 01:15:34,576
Do my soldiers have to tie you up?

707
01:15:35,922 --> 01:15:37,981
At least let me find him
a ohange of olothes.

708
01:15:41,494 --> 01:15:43,860
Forget the noodles.

709
01:15:45,365 --> 01:15:47,526
What if l let you go to sohool?

710
01:15:48,301 --> 01:15:49,529
How would that be?

711
01:15:49,603 --> 01:15:50,865
l'd keep my mouth shut.

712
01:15:50,904 --> 01:15:52,496
-The a Promise?
-The a Promise.

713
01:15:52,606 --> 01:15:53,834
Good.

714
01:16:25,906 --> 01:16:28,101
l didn't see Sir Tu'an bring any boy here.

715
01:16:28,341 --> 01:16:30,104
Go and see for yourself.

716
01:17:03,977 --> 01:17:05,410
Why was the sohool built here?

717
01:17:05,445 --> 01:17:09,176
lt's in honor of Lady Zhuangji's ohild.

718
01:17:09,249 --> 01:17:10,682
Whose idea was that?

719
01:17:12,118 --> 01:17:13,915
Sir Tu'an.

720
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:16,548
M'Lady - There are soIdiers everywhere!

721
01:17:20,193 --> 01:17:22,661
Tu'an hasn't been here.
Neither has your son.

722
01:17:39,579 --> 01:17:41,672
Bo'er!

723
01:17:41,982 --> 01:17:43,040
Cheng Ying -

01:17:45,051 --> 01:17:47,383
HeIp me deIiver my chiId!

725
01:17:58,298 --> 01:18:01,426
lf Dad looks for me at the sohool -The a
what then?

726
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:04,699
He'll be like an ant in a hot wok.

727
01:18:06,706 --> 01:18:09,675
Bo'er! Bo'er!

728
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:19,015
l want to oome again tomorrow.

729
01:18:19,285 --> 01:18:20,752
Easy.

730
01:18:21,187 --> 01:18:23,155
Come early.

731
01:18:23,656 --> 01:18:24,748
l'll be waiting.

732
01:18:27,427 --> 01:18:29,691
Godfather, do you have enemies?

733
01:18:29,729 --> 01:18:32,357
Enemies?

734
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,661
The year you were born...

735
01:18:36,369 --> 01:18:38,269
l killed them all.

736
01:18:40,073 --> 01:18:43,236
You know why your dad
keeps you in his sight?

737
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:47,412
lt was also that year.

738
01:18:48,481 --> 01:18:51,279
He almost lost you.

739
01:18:51,317 --> 01:18:53,342
Does my dad have enemies?

740
01:18:58,024 --> 01:19:00,083
Everyone does.

741
01:19:02,562 --> 01:19:05,725
Godfather, is it possible
not to have enemies?

742
01:19:08,068 --> 01:19:13,370
lf everyone oould do this -The a
not see their enemies as suoh -The a

743
01:19:14,474 --> 01:19:16,635
no one would have enemies at all.

744
01:19:18,478 --> 01:19:19,706
But it's not easy.

745
01:19:21,247 --> 01:19:23,374
l know l oan't do it.

746
01:19:25,118 --> 01:19:27,348
Come. l'll teaoh you...

747
01:19:28,388 --> 01:19:29,821
how to exterminate your enemies.

748
01:20:10,096 --> 01:20:13,395
You haven't told me what you learned
at sohool today.

749
01:20:16,369 --> 01:20:19,361
What it would take for a world
without enmity.

750
01:20:20,673 --> 01:20:23,107
lf you don't treat another as your enemy,

751
01:20:23,710 --> 01:20:25,234
he won't be your enemy.

752
01:20:25,278 --> 01:20:26,302
Liar!

753
01:20:26,346 --> 01:20:27,574
You never went to sohool!

754
01:20:28,748 --> 01:20:30,375
All you learned was how
to lie to your dad.

755
01:20:35,655 --> 01:20:36,644
Tell me.

756
01:20:38,124 --> 01:20:40,615
Did you spend the whole day
with your godfather?

757
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:41,718
Yes.

758
01:20:48,701 --> 01:20:49,690
What'd you tell him?

759
01:20:49,736 --> 01:20:52,227
l told you l wouldn't tell him anything.

760
01:20:52,272 --> 01:20:53,296
Liar.

761
01:20:53,339 --> 01:20:55,500
How'd the subjeot of enemies oome up?

762
01:20:55,542 --> 01:20:57,237
You drive me orazy.

763
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:03,274
You won't slip out of my sight again,

764
01:21:03,683 --> 01:21:05,617
and forget about sohool.

765
01:21:08,321 --> 01:21:10,619
You want one day
without me watohing over you?

766
01:21:11,591 --> 01:21:12,580
Have one.

767
01:21:18,231 --> 01:21:19,323
He won't tell me.

768
01:21:20,633 --> 01:21:22,726
He's hard to oontrol now
that he's older.

769
01:21:25,438 --> 01:21:26,530
He lied to me just now.

770
01:21:26,706 --> 01:21:28,640
lf he oan lie to you,

771
01:21:30,343 --> 01:21:33,540
maybe he's already gone behind your baok
and told Tu'an about us.

772
01:21:38,785 --> 01:21:40,650
We have to think of a way...

773
01:21:42,288 --> 01:21:45,587
to find out for sure if he's done so or not.

774
01:21:46,659 --> 01:21:48,820
And to ensure he doesn't in the future.

775
01:22:05,511 --> 01:22:07,502
He's not easy to soare.

776
01:22:07,547 --> 01:22:09,913
Play for real,
and we'll know for sure.

777
01:22:10,850 --> 01:22:13,284
He won't dare say anything after that.

778
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:42,411
This is my son, Cheng Bo.

779
01:22:42,448 --> 01:22:44,643
l know you. You're my godfather's enemy.

780
01:22:44,684 --> 01:22:45,742
Rubbish.

781
01:22:48,688 --> 01:22:51,282
You've told him, haven't you?

782
01:22:51,324 --> 01:22:53,258
l'll tell him tomorrow.

783
01:23:00,933 --> 01:23:02,594
-The a lf you dare...
-The a Dad.

784
01:23:02,635 --> 01:23:04,364
l'll kill you first!

785
01:23:11,277 --> 01:23:13,006
Touoh him again
and you'll have to fight me.

786
01:23:28,761 --> 01:23:30,058
Bo'er, run!

787
01:23:32,298 --> 01:23:35,756
Say anything
and l'll kill your dad, then you.

788
01:23:35,835 --> 01:23:37,325
Bo'er, run!

789
01:23:49,782 --> 01:23:52,046
How oould you let him esoape?

790
01:23:53,519 --> 01:23:55,453
This ruins everything!

791
01:23:58,624 --> 01:24:00,615
This is how you've taught him?

792
01:24:17,543 --> 01:24:19,033
You bit him?

793
01:24:32,658 --> 01:24:33,818
Dad.

794
01:24:38,097 --> 01:24:39,587
Let me go to sohool!

795
01:24:39,832 --> 01:24:41,561
Forget it.

796
01:24:41,834 --> 01:24:43,825
Then l'll tell about you and Soarfaoe.

797
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:45,735
You won't leave this house.

798
01:24:59,552 --> 01:25:00,450
Come baok.

799
01:25:01,654 --> 01:25:02,621
Halt!

800
01:25:04,157 --> 01:25:05,124
Halt!

801
01:25:06,659 --> 01:25:07,591
Halt!

802
01:25:09,495 --> 01:25:12,055
Godfather, Godfather!
l've got something to tell you.

803
01:25:20,973 --> 01:25:22,873
l'm taking you to sohool right now.

804
01:25:23,743 --> 01:25:25,176
l want Godfather to take me.

805
01:25:30,983 --> 01:25:33,076
-The a Let me go!
-The a Cheng Ying.

806
01:25:33,119 --> 01:25:35,451
Godfather, save me!

807
01:25:35,521 --> 01:25:38,456
Let me go! Let me go!

808
01:25:38,491 --> 01:25:39,856
You're out of line! Let him go.

809
01:25:39,892 --> 01:25:41,519
Let me go!

810
01:25:41,561 --> 01:25:43,620
Did you hear me? Hold it!

811
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:07,146
Whioh one of us do you want to kill?

812
01:26:34,247 --> 01:26:38,115
Why is my taking Bo'er to sohool
suoh a problem?

813
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:43,648
ls the subjeot of Bo'er's eduoation
worth drawing swords over?

814
01:26:47,159 --> 01:26:48,956
This isn'tjust grief.

815
01:26:49,095 --> 01:26:50,653
There's something else going on.

816
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:54,993
Tell me.

817
01:26:55,201 --> 01:26:57,226
What's wrong with you...

818
01:26:57,670 --> 01:27:00,537
that you oan't let him
out of your sight?

819
01:27:08,948 --> 01:27:11,542
Do you know, Bo'er?

820
01:27:13,953 --> 01:27:16,683
l'll tell you.
He's never known his mother.

821
01:27:18,257 --> 01:27:19,281
No.

822
01:27:20,026 --> 01:27:21,118
lt's not that.

823
01:27:27,066 --> 01:27:28,966
l oan see...

824
01:27:30,903 --> 01:27:32,029
that you hate me.

825
01:27:32,071 --> 01:27:33,038
True.

826
01:27:34,674 --> 01:27:37,268
Bo'er, your godfather's soldiers
murdered your mother!

827
01:27:39,011 --> 01:27:41,741
Didn't you promise
not to tell him that?

828
01:27:41,981 --> 01:27:45,280
You asked. l had to tell the truth.

829
01:27:50,156 --> 01:27:51,214
Bo'er...

830
01:27:52,725 --> 01:27:54,283
your dad hates me.

831
01:27:54,961 --> 01:27:56,622
But you're not allowed to.

832
01:28:17,950 --> 01:28:20,145
l don't want to be his godson anymore.

833
01:28:28,794 --> 01:28:30,887
lf you don't learn martial arts
from him,

834
01:28:31,063 --> 01:28:33,258
you'll never beat him.

835
01:28:33,799 --> 01:28:35,858
Dad, please don't follow me anymore.

836
01:28:35,968 --> 01:28:40,234
Your and Unole Soarfaoe's seoret
is safe with me.

837
01:28:41,974 --> 01:28:42,963
Not so loud.

838
01:28:47,913 --> 01:28:50,746
Eat up. Then you oan go to sohool.

839
01:29:02,094 --> 01:29:05,222
You oan go without me.
l don't need to take you.

840
01:29:43,002 --> 01:29:44,333
You oan't go.

841
01:29:45,071 --> 01:29:48,404
l didn't raise you for 15 years
so you oould go to war.

842
01:29:48,674 --> 01:29:49,800
Dad!

843
01:29:49,842 --> 01:29:52,140
You said you'd stop watohing over me.

844
01:29:52,912 --> 01:29:56,006
onoe l'm a hero,
you'd be known as Cheng Bo's dad.

845
01:29:56,082 --> 01:29:57,208
No one would dare touoh you.

846
01:29:57,283 --> 01:29:59,410
How do you know
you'll be the viotor?

847
01:29:59,452 --> 01:30:01,750
Beoause Godfather trained me
in martial arts.

848
01:30:03,055 --> 01:30:04,852
You think only of him.

849
01:30:07,827 --> 01:30:09,260
lt makes me so angry.

850
01:30:12,031 --> 01:30:13,123
You're upset again.

851
01:30:13,165 --> 01:30:14,689
He's going.

852
01:30:15,234 --> 01:30:18,795
What if he gets killed?
All this -The a for nothing.

853
01:30:19,438 --> 01:30:22,305
Cheng Ying, don't be selfish.

854
01:30:23,008 --> 01:30:27,775
Don't let your own feelings
prevent him from beooming a warrior.

855
01:30:29,949 --> 01:30:31,974
That's what he needs.

856
01:30:34,754 --> 01:30:36,051
Go somewhere.

857
01:30:37,022 --> 01:30:38,922
Let me talk to Bo'er.

858
01:30:46,332 --> 01:30:48,994
-The a Dad, where would you go?
-The a our old home.

859
01:30:52,772 --> 01:30:53,830
Put on your armor.

860
01:30:55,508 --> 01:30:57,840
You're his dad. You speak first.

861
01:30:59,044 --> 01:31:00,170
What'll l say?

862
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:01,974
That l'm not his dad?

863
01:31:02,014 --> 01:31:04,209
That Zhao Shuo was his dad
and Zhuangji his ma?

864
01:31:04,350 --> 01:31:06,045
Wouldn't that give him a fright?

865
01:31:06,786 --> 01:31:08,014
All right, l'll speak first.

866
01:31:09,054 --> 01:31:10,180
l'll begin with this soar.

867
01:31:10,222 --> 01:31:11,120
Forget it.

868
01:31:11,924 --> 01:31:14,415
He's never liked you.
He won't believe it.

869
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:16,860
Then l'll leave. You talk to him.

870
01:31:17,997 --> 01:31:18,964
You oan't go.

871
01:31:23,302 --> 01:31:25,327
Without you, he'd be dead.

872
01:31:26,906 --> 01:31:29,204
He needs to know you saved his life.

873
01:31:38,984 --> 01:31:40,212
To your wife.

874
01:31:41,954 --> 01:31:42,978
To Lady Zhuangji.

875
01:31:43,022 --> 01:31:45,047
To your son.

876
01:31:50,996 --> 01:31:52,190
To Sir Gongsun.

877
01:31:52,531 --> 01:31:53,555
Godfather.

878
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:02,871
lmpressive?

879
01:32:06,445 --> 01:32:07,537
Go baok...

880
01:32:08,547 --> 01:32:09,912
and oome out again.

881
01:32:37,343 --> 01:32:38,435
lmpressed?

882
01:32:46,018 --> 01:32:48,179
You remind me of someone.

883
01:32:48,254 --> 01:32:49,585
Not my dad?

884
01:32:51,223 --> 01:32:52,850
Yes, your dad.

885
01:32:53,259 --> 01:32:55,090
No, l have to go oheer him up.

886
01:32:55,861 --> 01:32:56,850
Go.

887
01:33:05,137 --> 01:33:08,197
l'll start with the story
of the medioine basket.

888
01:33:09,241 --> 01:33:11,106
All that's easy enough.

889
01:33:12,878 --> 01:33:14,368
But if Bo'er asks you...

890
01:33:15,114 --> 01:33:17,275
who was the boy
who died in his plaoe...

891
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:18,882
what'll you say?

892
01:33:18,918 --> 01:33:21,148
That he was my son.

893
01:33:21,453 --> 01:33:22,613
And he'd believe it?

894
01:33:24,156 --> 01:33:26,522
That you were oapable of that?

895
01:33:27,326 --> 01:33:29,419
You have to oonvinoe him.
Tell him...

896
01:33:30,529 --> 01:33:32,326
that the boy who died...

897
01:33:34,433 --> 01:33:36,128
was a foundling.

898
01:33:37,236 --> 01:33:38,328
Stolen.

899
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:43,137
Then my son died for nothing.

900
01:33:43,909 --> 01:33:45,900
lt was my son who died for him.

901
01:33:46,245 --> 01:33:48,509
He has to be Zhao Shuo's son.

902
01:33:50,149 --> 01:33:52,310
Fifteen years ago...

903
01:33:54,586 --> 01:33:56,611
when we knooked down the wall

904
01:33:56,922 --> 01:33:59,948
and found that woman and ohild,

905
01:33:59,992 --> 01:34:03,018
it was olear she was his mother.

906
01:34:05,097 --> 01:34:07,463
So you mean that...

907
01:34:08,067 --> 01:34:11,036
the boy you killed was Cheng Ying's son?

908
01:34:11,537 --> 01:34:14,665
That to save the Zhao ohild...

909
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:17,204
he'd saorifioe his own wife and ohild?

910
01:34:17,343 --> 01:34:18,503
ls that possible?

911
01:34:20,346 --> 01:34:21,540
Why not?

912
01:34:23,649 --> 01:34:29,417
ln the heat of the moment,
anything's possible.

913
01:34:47,172 --> 01:34:49,163
Dad has something to tell you.

914
01:34:50,142 --> 01:34:54,078
You'll see then why
l don't want you going to war.

915
01:34:54,646 --> 01:34:55,704
l'm listening.

916
01:34:56,181 --> 01:34:57,443
Your surname is Zhao,

917
01:34:58,384 --> 01:35:00,011
not Cheng.

918
01:35:01,754 --> 01:35:04,348
Your father was the hero Zhao Shuo.

919
01:35:04,757 --> 01:35:07,726
Your mother was the king's sister
Lady Zhuangji.

920
01:35:09,328 --> 01:35:11,387
The day you were born,

921
01:35:11,597 --> 01:35:14,589
your enemy exterminated
300 members of your family.

922
01:35:15,167 --> 01:35:16,327
Who was this enemy?

923
01:35:16,368 --> 01:35:17,357
Tu'an Gu.

924
01:35:19,738 --> 01:35:21,672
He killed your entire family...

925
01:35:22,408 --> 01:35:24,000
and would have killed you too.

926
01:35:24,676 --> 01:35:27,144
Beoause you were the last of the Zhaos.

927
01:35:29,014 --> 01:35:30,242
To resoue you...

928
01:35:31,250 --> 01:35:33,514
Cheng Ying let another boy
take your plaoe

929
01:35:34,053 --> 01:35:35,350
and saved your life.

930
01:35:37,056 --> 01:35:38,614
He is your true savior.

931
01:35:39,591 --> 01:35:40,785
Who was the boy?

932
01:35:45,731 --> 01:35:48,222
one fated to die,

933
01:35:50,035 --> 01:35:50,797
a foundling.

934
01:35:51,036 --> 01:35:52,503
Not true.

935
01:35:53,338 --> 01:35:55,033
-The a lt was his own son.
-The a Nonsense.

936
01:35:55,074 --> 01:35:56,405
He allowed his son to die
in your plaoe.

937
01:35:56,442 --> 01:35:57,773
l knew you were Godfather's enemy.

938
01:36:01,113 --> 01:36:02,603
But he's not my enemy.

939
01:36:02,781 --> 01:36:04,510
Don't think l'm going
to kill him for you.

940
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:06,142
l won't kill my Godfather.

941
01:36:09,488 --> 01:36:10,546
Dad -The a

942
01:36:11,557 --> 01:36:13,422
make up whatever story you like.

943
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:15,456
l'm going to war.

944
01:36:22,201 --> 01:36:23,168
Bo'er.

945
01:36:30,542 --> 01:36:33,272
Take this medioine.
lt oould save your life.

946
01:36:34,346 --> 01:36:36,075
lt's the last one.

947
01:36:38,550 --> 01:36:40,142
Keep it.

948
01:36:40,385 --> 01:36:41,750
l'm going to win my battles.

949
01:36:44,089 --> 01:36:45,784
-The a Bo'er.
-The a What?

950
01:36:46,391 --> 01:36:47,653
lf you're not winning, run.

951
01:36:52,097 --> 01:36:53,758
Well, that's 15 years wasted.

952
01:36:57,102 --> 01:36:58,364
You're right.

953
01:36:59,104 --> 01:37:00,628
Who'd believe that story?

954
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,702
There's always me.

955
01:37:03,575 --> 01:37:04,542
Prepare some poison.

956
01:37:06,411 --> 01:37:10,871
Arm yourselves.
The oavalry is assembled.

957
01:37:22,794 --> 01:37:24,421
Godfather's been thinking.

958
01:37:25,397 --> 01:37:26,557
l'm worried.

959
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:29,792
l'm going with you.

960
01:37:33,539 --> 01:37:34,801
You don't give me any oredit.

961
01:38:57,923 --> 01:39:01,791
Kill!

962
01:39:13,872 --> 01:39:14,964
Follow me!

963
01:40:10,362 --> 01:40:12,796
Don't let him esoape! Grab him.

964
01:40:30,515 --> 01:40:33,507
Halt!

965
01:41:36,014 --> 01:41:36,946
Halt!

966
01:41:44,156 --> 01:41:46,021
Godfather!

967
01:41:47,159 --> 01:41:49,650
Help me!

968
01:42:30,669 --> 01:42:31,636
Godfather!

969
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:49,885
Godfather, we've won!

970
01:42:54,226 --> 01:42:55,955
l oongratulate you.

971
01:43:03,134 --> 01:43:04,101
Let's go.

972
01:43:49,581 --> 01:43:50,912
Bo'er was viotorious.

973
01:43:56,021 --> 01:43:58,683
Dad, where's that medioine?

974
01:43:59,057 --> 01:44:00,081
Godfather's wounded.

975
01:44:00,125 --> 01:44:01,285
So you won.

976
01:44:01,526 --> 01:44:02,288
The medioine!

977
01:44:02,861 --> 01:44:05,853
Bo'er, l'm taking you away...

978
01:44:08,867 --> 01:44:10,892
to live an ordinary life.

979
01:44:10,936 --> 01:44:11,925
The medioine!

980
01:44:12,203 --> 01:44:13,636
Godfather's dying!

981
01:44:46,171 --> 01:44:47,661
Put that down.

982
01:44:52,677 --> 01:44:53,575
Give it to me.

983
01:44:53,778 --> 01:44:54,802
Let go.

984
01:44:54,913 --> 01:44:55,777
Give it to me.

985
01:44:55,814 --> 01:44:56,940
Let go.

986
01:44:57,582 --> 01:44:58,344
You want to save him. You...

987
01:44:58,583 --> 01:44:59,607
Let go!

988
01:45:00,118 --> 01:45:02,814
lt's time for all this to end.

989
01:45:07,659 --> 01:45:10,719
Refuse me this...
and l'll die with him.

990
01:45:22,807 --> 01:45:24,707
-The a Dissolve it in warm water.
-The a All right.

991
01:45:31,016 --> 01:45:33,246
Godfather, hold on.

992
01:45:33,284 --> 01:45:34,945
l've got the medioine.

993
01:45:53,638 --> 01:45:58,234
I've found him!

994
01:46:55,033 --> 01:46:56,022
Bo'er.

995
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:02,972
Bo'er!

996
01:47:06,878 --> 01:47:07,810
Godfather,

997
01:47:08,346 --> 01:47:09,404
you're shouting.

998
01:47:09,447 --> 01:47:11,438
l oan hear from your voioe...

999
01:47:11,950 --> 01:47:13,212
You're better.

1000
01:47:13,251 --> 01:47:16,778
lt happened as soon as l took that pill.

1001
01:47:18,189 --> 01:47:20,316
While resting these few days...

1002
01:47:20,992 --> 01:47:23,426
l thought everything through.

1003
01:47:27,065 --> 01:47:28,726
As for you...

1004
01:47:29,367 --> 01:47:33,770
l suspeot you're not really
your dad's son.

1005
01:47:36,941 --> 01:47:38,033
Then who am l?

1006
01:47:38,076 --> 01:47:39,475
The ohild of Zhao.

1007
01:47:41,412 --> 01:47:45,508
l believe he let his own son
die in your plaoe.

1008
01:47:51,322 --> 01:47:52,186
Call your dad here.

1009
01:47:53,525 --> 01:47:55,755
l want to thank him properly.

1010
01:48:21,186 --> 01:48:23,984
Han Jue said your son died in my plaoe.

1011
01:48:25,790 --> 01:48:27,951
Can you prove you had a son?

1012
01:48:31,362 --> 01:48:32,454
Easily.

1013
01:49:29,287 --> 01:49:31,619
This was his room.

1014
01:49:31,856 --> 01:49:33,847
So who am l, really?

1015
01:49:37,161 --> 01:49:40,221
l told you -The a the orphan of Zhao.

1016
01:49:42,500 --> 01:49:45,560
My own son was killed by Tu'an Gu.

1017
01:49:45,603 --> 01:49:48,071
Why'd you let me have the medioine?

1018
01:49:51,209 --> 01:49:52,608
You're a loser.

1019
01:49:53,211 --> 01:49:54,235
You always have been!

1020
01:49:56,247 --> 01:49:57,373
Don't talk to your dad like that!

1021
01:49:59,550 --> 01:50:01,108
You're not my dad.

1022
01:50:07,158 --> 01:50:09,524
How oan you say that?

1023
01:50:13,164 --> 01:50:15,928
You're my son.

1024
01:50:54,072 --> 01:50:56,370
My name is Cheng Ying.
This is Cheng Bo.

1025
01:50:57,075 --> 01:50:59,202
Sir, pIease accept us...

1026
01:51:00,011 --> 01:51:02,241
into your retinue.

1027
01:51:03,281 --> 01:51:06,341
To serve and foIIow...

1028
01:51:06,584 --> 01:51:08,176
to the end of time.

1029
01:51:16,561 --> 01:51:18,722
Dad, tell him who l am!

1030
01:51:22,967 --> 01:51:24,958
l advise you not to fight.

1031
01:51:25,169 --> 01:51:26,329
lt's no use.

1032
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:31,106
You oan go as far away as you like.

1033
01:51:32,010 --> 01:51:34,171
But first, l need to ask...

1034
01:51:37,615 --> 01:51:40,448
Who'd you get to shoot
this poison arrow?

1035
01:51:41,252 --> 01:51:43,186
Han Jue.

1036
01:51:45,456 --> 01:51:48,391
For 15 years,
we've been plotting your murder.

1037
01:51:50,495 --> 01:51:53,692
He helped me smuggle the boy
out to safety.

1038
01:51:53,731 --> 01:51:56,427
So l was right to slash him.

1039
01:51:58,669 --> 01:52:00,569
But why'd he do that?

1040
01:52:01,205 --> 01:52:05,141
We were both there
when Lady Zhuangji died.

1041
01:52:05,176 --> 01:52:07,110
She begged us to save her ohild.

1042
01:52:07,145 --> 01:52:09,579
oh. lt was an aot of oonsoienoe.

1043
01:52:10,515 --> 01:52:13,109
lf it were me...
maybe l'd do the same.

1044
01:52:15,186 --> 01:52:18,417
Han Jue never had the ohanoe to kill me.
But you oould easily...

1045
01:52:18,489 --> 01:52:20,320
have slipped poison in my medioine.

1046
01:52:20,792 --> 01:52:23,192
Why wait 15 years?

1047
01:52:23,227 --> 01:52:24,626
l made a vow...

1048
01:52:26,230 --> 01:52:28,664
to raise the ohild first.

1049
01:52:30,368 --> 01:52:33,166
I'II take him to Tu'an Gu...

1050
01:52:33,204 --> 01:52:37,265
and reveaI his identity...

1051
01:52:38,543 --> 01:52:40,204
and my own.

1052
01:52:51,222 --> 01:52:53,247
l see why you saved me now.

1053
01:52:55,093 --> 01:52:56,651
You didn't want me to die.

1054
01:52:58,096 --> 01:53:01,259
You wanted to make me a laughingstook.

1055
01:53:01,632 --> 01:53:03,623
-The a To live a life worse than death.
-The a No.

1056
01:53:04,102 --> 01:53:06,627
l saved you beoause Bo'er
wanted to repay you.

1057
01:53:09,207 --> 01:53:10,196
Cheng Ying,

1058
01:53:11,542 --> 01:53:14,670
when l killed that ohild...

1059
01:53:15,413 --> 01:53:19,349
you and your wife oould've told me
he was yours.

1060
01:53:22,253 --> 01:53:26,280
What did Gongsun do to persuade you

1061
01:53:26,324 --> 01:53:28,588
to saorifioe your own ohild for him?

1062
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:31,255
His death...

1063
01:53:32,663 --> 01:53:36,759
oonvinoed you that he was
the Zhao ohild.

1064
01:53:36,801 --> 01:53:38,166
l had my doubts.

1065
01:53:39,871 --> 01:53:44,171
only when you gave him to me
did l believe...

1066
01:53:44,842 --> 01:53:46,639
he was the Zhao ohild.

1067
01:53:49,380 --> 01:53:50,608
You trioked me.

1068
01:53:50,648 --> 01:53:52,639
No, you trioked me.

1069
01:53:59,190 --> 01:54:01,658
A man who would betray
his own ohild...

1070
01:54:02,426 --> 01:54:04,121
soares me.

1071
01:54:06,130 --> 01:54:09,497
our boy was not going to survive anyway.

1072
01:54:10,168 --> 01:54:11,692
We oouldn't drag another into the mess.

1073
01:54:15,306 --> 01:54:16,705
lf he knew...

1074
01:54:17,375 --> 01:54:19,673
how many lives he saved...

1075
01:54:24,415 --> 01:54:26,576
he wouldn't blame us.

1076
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:30,548
