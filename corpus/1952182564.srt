163
00:09:14,737 --> 00:09:15,965
JENNY:
Come on.

164
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,902
See? I knew there wouldn't be
any weirdness between you two.

165
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:23,239
- Connor, you remember Sandra?
- Yes, I do. How are you, Sandra?

166
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,640
You know, it's not too late
to get out, gorgeous.

167
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,078
He's joking.

168
00:09:28,251 --> 00:09:30,048
And you know the bridesmaids.

169
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:33,586
Oh, yes, I do. Deena, Donna.
How are you?

170
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:34,916
- And, uh...?
- Denice.

171
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:37,651
CONNOR: Nice to meet you, Denice. Ladies.
- Me too. How are you?

172
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,660
PAUL: My groomsmen.
Guys, this is my brother, Connor.

173
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,831
- We've heard the stories, man.
CONNOR: Oh, okay.

174
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,059
- An honor to be serving with you.
- And with you.

175
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:48,863
It's "mice" to "neet" you.
Damn it, I blew it.

176
00:09:49,038 --> 00:09:51,131
JENNY: Sorry to break up the bromance,
guys, but...

177
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:53,935
...I need you right here
where I can keep my eyes on you.

178
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,635
- Absolutely.
- Are we ready?

179
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:57,904
Yes, sorry, sarge.

180
00:09:58,414 --> 00:10:00,609
Sarge?
Are they getting married by a cop?

181
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:03,980
Sergeant Major Volcom,
United States Marine Corps.

182
00:10:04,153 --> 00:10:06,951
I am not a cop.

183
00:10:08,424 --> 00:10:12,258
- Where'd you find this ray of sunshine?
PAUL: He's Sandra's dad.

184
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:15,522
Sarge, this is my brother, Connor.
Connor, this is the sarge.

185
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,689
He was ordained right after the war.

186
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:21,234
Little war called Korea.
Perhaps you've heard of it, slick?

187
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:23,235
Lost more men than Nam.

188
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:25,772
We didn't get a wall.
We didn't get a movie.

189
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:29,399
We got a sitcom with Alan Alda
which was all nonstop laughs...

190
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:31,978
...unless you were the one
watching his friends die.

191
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:34,673
The war's over, Dad. It was a tie.

192
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,717
You know, we should probably try
to keep going on schedule.

193
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,253
- Hua.
- Hua.

194
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:44,484
Following the kiss at 1530 hours,
on my mark...

195
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,628
...groom will take bride's left forearm...

196
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:50,857
...rotate 180 degrees,
orienting north by northwest.

197
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:53,900
Then I will announce you
as husband and wife.

198
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,061
Following which...

199
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,901
Following which,
you will live happily ever after.

SANDRA:
Oh, Daddy.

00:11:05,781 --> 00:11:08,113
DENICE: So sweet. Oh, my God.
DEENA: That is sweet.

203
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,947
- I'm surrounded by huggers.
- There we go.

204
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:15,056
- No, we're cool, man.
- Come on.

205
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:29,805
Hey, Uncle Wayne.

206
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:36,802
Ah, the world's a lot less fun
without you in it, buddy.

207
00:11:41,584 --> 00:11:43,916
Oh, no. Oh, no.

208
00:11:44,086 --> 00:11:47,578
No decorations in here. No.

209
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:50,248
No. No.

210
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:52,656
And, yes.

211
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:53,852
No.

212
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:59,666
- No! Wha...? What did...? What the...?
- Something wrong?

213
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,629
I got over 30 scented candles
in my room.

214
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,537
- Oh, the wedding scent is lavender.
- The wedding scent?

215
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,645
- And people wonder why I'm not married.
- Not really.

216
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:14,510
I mean, seriously, Jenny, my Uncle Wayne
is rolling over in his grave right now.

217
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:16,651
No, come on. Wayne loved a good party.

218
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:20,880
Party, yes. A wedding? No.
Back in the day that man used this place...

219
00:12:21,056 --> 00:12:25,584
...for mind-numbing, clothing-optional,
weeklong orgies, okay?

220
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:28,059
Do you know Dean Martin
slept in that bathroom?

221
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,358
He drank from the bidet
and sang the Canadian national anthem...

222
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:32,831
...in Spanish.
- In Spanish.

223
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:38,599
- Yeah, I remember Wayne telling us that.
- Yeah. Now that, that was a party. Not this.

224
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:43,875
You know, people were taking bets
on whether or not you'd even show up.

225
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:46,446
- Miss my kid brother's wedding?
- That's what I said.

226
00:12:46,615 --> 00:12:50,073
The whole asshole thing you do
is to get insecure women to sleep with you.

227
00:12:50,252 --> 00:12:54,086
- Deep down, you're a big sweetheart.
- Oh. Look who's got me pegged.

228
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:58,056
And there's the sarcasm to cover up
the accidental display of affection for Paul.

229
00:12:58,227 --> 00:12:59,694
Hey.

230
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,053
I'm not covering anything up.

231
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:07,963
And I would also be more than happy to
take off the rest of my clothes to prove it.

232
00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:12,369
Then there's the cheap sexual innuendo.
All the old Connor Mead tricks are back.

233
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,704
Well, don't worry,
your secret's safe with me.

00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,870

- Dan Palumbo. Married.

Oh. Kids?

241
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:39,397
What? They're not really married
unless they have kids.

I'm a huge fan of your work.

- Gonna photograph your brother's wedding?

No. No, I'm not a wedding photographer.

- Right.

00:14:18,173 --> 00:14:21,870

with their clothes on.

00:14:46,502 --> 00:14:50,632
- Endive arugula salad. You did well...
- No, no, no. The salad I ordered had figs.

268
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:54,708
Yeah, because fruit is the new crouton.
This is...

- Come on.
- This always happens. All Scotch, no carbs.

Paulie, you know where I come out
on all this, buddy.

308
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:51,659
To me, marriage is an archaic
and oppressive institution...

309
00:16:51,827 --> 00:16:53,954
...that should a been abolished years ago.

310
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:58,828
And love? It's magical comfort food
for the weak and the uneducated.

311
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:01,196
Yeah, it makes you feel all warm
and relevant...

312
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:05,602
...but in the end, love leaves you weak,
dependant and fat.

313
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,771
- Yeah, that might not make the best toast.
- Are you saying I'm fat?

314
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,810
- No. Are you kidding?
PAUL: No, no, no.

I wish I could believe in all this crap. I do.

318
00:17:24,226 --> 00:17:26,694
And I also wish I could believe
in the Easter bunny...

319
00:17:26,862 --> 00:17:30,320
...the missile shield,
and strippers with a heart of gold, all right?

320
00:17:30,499 --> 00:17:35,061
But, unfortunately, I am condemned
to see the world as it really is.

321
00:17:35,237 --> 00:17:37,637
And love? Love is a myth.

00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:20,506
Makes them feel more powerful, which
in turn makes them feel more comfortable.

655
00:38:20,681 --> 00:38:23,616
Which in turn makes them prone
to massive errors in judgment...

656
00:38:23,784 --> 00:38:27,811
...like, having sex with a complete stranger
in the port authority bathroom. Ha, ha.

657
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:30,219
But I'm not even supposed
to talk to strangers.

658
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,655
No, that's good, that's good.
No talking is good.

659

No phone numbers, no last names.
Hey, no first names if you can swing it.

660

Will somebody please
call Child Protective Services?

661
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:41,062
Shh. Quiet, the prophet speaks.

662
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:44,762
See, kid, an ugly broad, you might as well
take her out behind the shed...

663
00:38:44,939 --> 00:38:47,499
...and put one behind the ear.
That dog won't hunt.

664
00:38:47,675 --> 00:38:50,235
But any dude with a johnson,
he's got a shot...

665
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:55,314
...because cool comes from the inside.
- God, I miss that man.

666
00:38:55,483 --> 00:38:56,950
WAYNE:
So here's a couple of tips.

667
00:38:57,118 --> 00:39:01,953
When you first meet a girl, you give her
two compliments, above the neck.

668
00:39:02,123 --> 00:39:05,581
You tell her she's got nice lips,
nice eyes, nice hair...

669
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,321
...she's intelligent, her moral ethics,
whatever crap comes to your mind.

670
00:39:09,497 --> 00:39:12,728
Then, just when she begins to think
that you're another, you know...

671
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,802
...vanilla-nice guy that she can tool around
with all night without getting naked...

672
00:39:17,638 --> 00:39:23,474
...you insult her. Flip the power dynamic,
and you let her know you're here to play.

673
00:39:23,644 --> 00:39:27,910
- Well, Jenny said she doesn't like games.
- Forget about that broad.

674
00:39:28,082 --> 00:39:31,779
- I thought all this was to get her back.
- That's why you gotta forget about her.

675
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:35,353
It's your feelings for her
that are killing your game.

676
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:39,724
If there's one thing
that you learn tonight, it's this:

677
00:39:39,894 --> 00:39:45,127
The power of a relationship lies
with whoever cares less.

678
00:39:47,334 --> 00:39:49,097
Amen to that, brother.

679
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:51,898
One day you're gonna wake up
with some chick, spooning...

680
00:39:52,073 --> 00:39:53,700
...you know, thinking about love.

681
00:39:53,874 --> 00:39:56,001
And at that moment,
you have gotta get up.

682
00:39:56,177 --> 00:39:59,078
Do not walk, don't get your shoes,
run the hell out of there.

683
00:39:59,246 --> 00:40:01,510
Because maybe not the next day
or the next week...

684
00:40:01,682 --> 00:40:05,413
...but sometime in the future,
you're gonna get crushed. Again.

685
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,211
- You don't wanna feel that way, do you?
- No.

686
00:40:08,389 --> 00:40:10,152
- No.
- Yep.

687
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:15,318
Okay, so, uh, let's get down
to brass tacks here.

688
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:20,299
Say I wanted to pick up
on that ice-cold blond at eight o'clock.

689
00:40:20,468 --> 00:40:23,403
Eight o'clock? How did you even see her?

690
00:40:23,571 --> 00:40:26,369
We'll deal with reflective surfaces
at another time.

691
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,373
Should I, uh, get a handful a daisies,
then go:

692
00:40:29,543 --> 00:40:31,511
"Hi, you wanna go to the disco with me?"

693
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,237
Uh...

694
00:40:33,414 --> 00:40:34,438
- No?
- No.

695
00:40:34,615 --> 00:40:37,982
No, because I might as well say,
"I'm a fag. Let's be friends."

696
00:40:38,152 --> 00:40:43,021
So, what would be a smart play?
Have some fun with it. What do you think?

I don't know. I mean...

698

...you could maybe
talk to the girl next to her?

699
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,293
You know, maybe make her feel jealous?

700
00:40:54,969 --> 00:41:00,908
Hand to God, kid, I never felt
like you were my son until now.

701
00:41:04,445 --> 00:41:08,347
Man, I don't know why we didn't have
this conversation years ago, huh?

702
00:41:08,983 --> 00:41:11,543
Well, that's enough for one night.

- No, no, no.

- Aah! Aah!

982
00:58:51,744 --> 00:58:53,678
VOLCOM:
He's not worth it, sweetheart.

983
00:58:53,846 --> 00:58:56,508
I'm fine. I'm fine.

984
00:58:56,683 --> 00:58:58,947
I am a lady.

985
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,712
I am a professional.

986
00:59:02,255 --> 00:59:04,485
And I'm fine.

987
00:59:05,158 --> 00:59:08,650
PAUL: Let's get out of here.
- Okay, see if you can stabilize the bride.

988
00:59:08,828 --> 00:59:12,093
I've got the cake and childcare.
Brad, some shiatsu for Sandra, please?

989
00:59:12,265 --> 00:59:13,823
Let's see some happy faces.

990
00:59:14,234 --> 00:59:15,292
Big happy, big happy.

991
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:17,493
Oh, where do you think you're going?

992
00:59:18,238 --> 00:59:20,331
- Breathe.
BRAD: Let me know if the pressure's okay.

993
00:59:20,506 --> 00:59:22,167
There you go.

994
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:25,368
- Thank you, Denice.
- Thank you.

995
00:59:25,545 --> 00:59:27,672
- Okay. Oh, that's good.
- She's freaking out.

996
00:59:27,847 --> 00:59:30,315
- I know.
- Connor is ruining the wedding.

997
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:33,509
He is also ruining
Operation Sex For Every Bridesmaid.

998
00:59:33,686 --> 00:59:35,586
- I almost hooked up with Connor.
- What?

999
00:59:35,755 --> 00:59:38,280
When he told me to go by his room,
the door was locked.

1000
00:59:38,458 --> 00:59:40,187
I could hear him talking to himself.

1001
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,952
Dude, that guy takes mind games...

1002
00:59:42,128 --> 00:59:44,096
...to the next level.
- Old school.

1003
00:59:44,264 --> 00:59:46,494
- So who's next?
- I'm up.

1004
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,964
Oh, wait. Are you the one
that slept with Paul?

1005
00:59:49,135 --> 00:59:50,830
- No.
- Because he won't go there.

1006
00:59:51,471 --> 00:59:54,838
- Ew. What?
- That would be me.

1007
00:59:56,309 --> 00:59:59,073
- Shut up. Shut your face.
- No. You never told us that.

1008
00:59:59,245 --> 01:00:02,772
Well, I'm paying the price. Looks like
I'm gonna have to get plastered...

1009
01:00:02,949 --> 01:00:05,611
...and downgrade
to one of Paul's desperate work friends.

1010
01:00:05,785 --> 01:00:08,345
I can transmit, page, pilot
and sync channels now.

1011
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:11,752
- What channel are you on?
- Hey, guys, holster them.

1012
01:00:12,592 --> 01:00:14,526
- Why?
- Women.

1013
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:15,854
Oh.

1014
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,054
- Say it isn't so.
- They're so weird.

1015
01:00:20,933 --> 01:00:25,666
- Yeah, somebody is enjoying this a little bit.
- Ha, ha. Are you kidding me?

1016
01:00:25,838 --> 01:00:29,604
Connor Mead, cleaning up his own mess.
I am loving it.

1017
01:00:30,643 --> 01:00:33,134
You know what? I'm sorry.

1018
01:00:33,746 --> 01:00:36,214
It's a cake.
There'll be a bakery open in town.

1019
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:39,249
I'm not talking about this.

1020
01:00:39,852 --> 01:00:43,754
I'm talking about us. You know?

1021
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:46,389
How it played out.

1022
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,891
You're actually apologizing, aren't you?

1023
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,963
Okay, we don't need
to make a production out of it, now.

1024
01:00:52,131 --> 01:00:54,793
How are things looking? Spick-and-span?
Any more spots?

1025
01:00:54,967 --> 01:00:59,666
You know, it was probably,
in some small way, partially my fault.

1026
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:02,637
- I was always attracted to assholes.
- Thank you very much.

1027
01:01:02,809 --> 01:01:06,609
Well, you know what I mean, though.
Projects. Guys that I thought I could fix.

1028
01:01:06,779 --> 01:01:09,247
Probably has something to do
with my dad.

1029
01:01:09,449 --> 01:01:12,384
- Probably.
- After you left, I made a vow to myself...

1030
01:01:12,552 --> 01:01:15,248
...to date only fully functional,
well-adjusted men.

1031
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:20,950
- No more works-in-progress. No dirtbags.
- So basically, women.

1032
01:01:21,127 --> 01:01:22,788
Basically women.

1033
01:01:22,962 --> 01:01:28,491
So how strong of a vow
is your no-dirtbags policy?

1034
01:01:28,668 --> 01:01:31,228
I had it tattooed on my ass.

1035
01:01:33,373 --> 01:01:35,568
- Can I see?
- No.

1036
01:01:36,976 --> 01:01:38,773
- Wait, what are you doing?
- What?

1037
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,344
- What?
- What am I doing? Wha...?

1038
01:01:40,513 --> 01:01:45,143
Okay, look. I know I dropped the ball
before a bit, but I have changed, I swear.

1039
01:01:45,318 --> 01:01:46,785
- No, you haven't.
- No, I have.

1040
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:51,151
Jenny, I'm seeing things
in a whole different way tonight.

1041
01:01:51,324 --> 01:01:54,919
All right? I love you. I think.
I mean, I always have.

1042
01:01:55,094 --> 01:01:58,552
- You're the one I was supposed to be with.
- Wait, Connor, stop it. Just...

1043
01:01:59,165 --> 01:02:02,828
I hear what you're saying,
and I think right now you actually believe it.

1044
01:02:03,002 --> 01:02:06,460
- Yeah.
- But I know you.

1045
01:02:07,774 --> 01:02:10,242
Tomorrow morning, I'll wake up.

1046
01:02:11,544 --> 01:02:13,307
You won't be there.

1047
01:02:14,247 --> 01:02:18,149
Okay, but, Jenny, I really, really don't
wanna be alone tonight, you know?

1048
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:20,649
- Okay. No, I get it.
- Will you please stay with me?

1049
01:02:21,387 --> 01:02:24,413
Seriously!
Jenny, I've got ghosts in my bedroom!

1050
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:30,386
WOMAN: Hello, Connor.
- Aah!

1051
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:33,593
Dude.

1052
01:02:33,766 --> 01:02:37,566
What does a girl have to do
to get laid at this wedding?

1053
01:02:40,606 --> 01:02:44,269
Yeah. Four Seasons, please.

1054
01:02:48,381 --> 01:02:51,373
- Come on, start. Aah!
- Where do you think you're going?

1055
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:58,419
Oh, Mel. God, you don't know
how happy I am to see you.

1056
01:02:59,225 --> 01:03:00,783
Aah!

1057
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,020
Really, did you learn nothing
from the last ghost?

1058
01:03:04,497 --> 01:03:06,522
- You're the ghost of girlfriends present?
- Mm-hm.

1059
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:09,031
- That makes no sense.
- Oh, tell me about it.

1060
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:12,433
But as sad as it is,
I'm the only consistent woman in your life.

1061
01:03:12,605 --> 01:03:16,803
So here I am,
just working on the weekend. Again.

1062
01:03:16,976 --> 01:03:18,466
But we never...

1063
01:03:18,644 --> 01:03:20,111
I mean, you...

1064
01:03:20,279 --> 01:03:22,338
- You're totally gay, right?
- What?

1065
01:03:22,515 --> 01:03:23,539
You're not?

1066
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:27,777
No. There was just one time in college.
I went to Barnard.

1067
01:03:27,954 --> 01:03:29,546
- Okay.
- I had no choice.

1068
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:31,314
Hey, I'm sorry, Mel.

1069
01:03:31,491 --> 01:03:34,051
If I'd have known,
I would of hit on you a lot sooner.

1070
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,127
Aw. Ha, ha.

1071
01:03:36,295 --> 01:03:39,958
- Ow! What was that for?
- Because tonight, I'm the boss.

1072
01:03:40,132 --> 01:03:41,599
You ready?

1073
01:03:46,272 --> 01:03:48,331
What are you doing?

1074
01:03:50,176 --> 01:03:53,805
Aren't we gonna, like,
fly off or something?

1075
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:57,746
It's the present, you idiot.
We're here already.

1076
01:04:03,055 --> 01:04:04,079
Mel.

1077
01:04:05,024 --> 01:04:08,016
PAUL: Okay, no. That is not what I said.
WOMAN: I don't care.

1078
01:04:08,194 --> 01:04:10,321
He's a beautiful piece of a man.

1079
01:04:10,496 --> 01:04:14,626
Hey, look at how much fun they're having
now that you're gone.

1080
01:04:15,067 --> 01:04:16,625
- He's not shallow.
- Shallow?

1081
01:04:16,802 --> 01:04:19,635
Honey, he spends every Christmas alone
at the Knicks game.

1082
01:04:19,805 --> 01:04:20,931
Yeah, he is all surface.

1083
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:24,702
Yeah, but in his defense,
it's a really hot surface.

1084
01:04:24,877 --> 01:04:26,970
- Well, yeah.
- Okay, he's not that bad.

1085
01:04:27,146 --> 01:04:30,582
- Thank you, Paulie.
DEENA: Paul, he hit on your mother in law.

1086
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:33,548
- I've banged worse.
- Thank you, Vonda.

1087
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:35,277
ALL:
Oh!

1088
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:38,685
You guys just don't know him like I do.
You don't.

1089
01:04:38,858 --> 01:04:41,190
You know, that guy practically raised me.

1090
01:04:41,661 --> 01:04:46,928
I was 2 when our parents died.
Connor was just 7.

1091
01:04:47,533 --> 01:04:52,994
You know, at an age when he's supposed
to be a kid, he's busy taking care of one.

1092
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:55,565
He taught me how to read.

1093
01:04:57,109 --> 01:04:59,873
He taught me how to ride a bike.

1094
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:04,973
He beat the crap out of any kid
who ever teased me.

1095
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:09,485
You know, he always said,
"Paulie, it's you and me against the world."

1096
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:16,060
My point is, I had the opportunity
to be a nice kid and Connor didn't.

1097
01:05:16,529 --> 01:05:20,056
Now, I know he seems like a joke
to you guys...

1098
01:05:20,232 --> 01:05:25,499
...and trust me, you all have fair points,
but that guy is the only family I've got.

1099
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:27,502
And if there's one thing family does...

1100
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:32,576
...it is believe, against all odds,
in the best of each other.

1101
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:39,110
I love him.

1102
01:05:39,285 --> 01:05:43,278
And as long as I live,
I'll believe he can change, because he's...

1103
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:46,258
He's my big brother.

1104
01:05:50,963 --> 01:05:52,954
I'm gonna call my brother.

1105
01:05:53,132 --> 01:05:54,690
It's been a while.

1106
01:05:56,102 --> 01:05:58,297
Of course,
that doesn't mean anything to you.

1107
01:05:58,771 --> 01:06:00,966
Because love doesn't exist, right?

1108
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:05,236
It's just, "magical comfort food
for the weak and uneducated"?

1109
01:06:05,411 --> 01:06:10,678
Wow, that is as close as I will ever come
to feeling something for Connor Mead.

1110
01:06:10,850 --> 01:06:13,284
- Kudos.
- I saw you chatting him up at the bar.

1111
01:06:13,919 --> 01:06:18,947
Well, I still wanna do him,
but now I'll be scrumping a tragic figure.

1112
01:06:19,125 --> 01:06:23,391
Ooh, like when Denice hooked up
with Gary Coleman at Lollapalooza.

1113
01:06:23,963 --> 01:06:28,161
I was drunk
and he had such delicate hands.

1114
01:06:28,768 --> 01:06:32,534
Denice, you think that's bad? I mean,
look at what Connor is doing to poor Jenny.

1115
01:06:32,705 --> 01:06:35,731
He has got that girl so twisted up
into a pretzel...

1116
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:39,173
...she can't even appreciate
that fine slice of wedding beefcake...

1117
01:06:39,345 --> 01:06:42,178
...that Sandy has flown in for her.

1118
01:06:42,348 --> 01:06:43,815
Hua! Ha, ha.

1119
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:48,019
Heard, understood, acknowledged?

1120
01:06:51,991 --> 01:06:53,185
Jenny, she's just...

1121
01:06:56,062 --> 01:06:57,723
Jenny.

1122
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:09,138
- Oh, Jesus. Is she okay?
- What do you think?

1123
01:07:09,308 --> 01:07:10,707
BRAD:
Jenny?

1124
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:15,277
Oh, of course.
Sensitive Brad to the rescue.

1125
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:20,010
Now, wait a second, are you actually trying
to repair this wedding cake?

1126
01:07:20,386 --> 01:07:22,013
Maybe.

1127
01:07:22,922 --> 01:07:26,722
- I mean, a little.
- I used to moonlight as a pastry chef.

1128
01:07:26,892 --> 01:07:29,884
- Tell me this guy's gay.
- He's not. Trust me.

1129
01:07:30,062 --> 01:07:32,121
- Really?
- No. Not really.

1130
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:34,698
[BOTH LAUGHING]

1131
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:36,863
You wanna talk about it?

1132
01:07:37,036 --> 01:07:40,028
As your designated wedding sex,
everything you say is privileged.

1133
01:07:40,206 --> 01:07:42,003
No, I just...

1134
01:07:42,174 --> 01:07:46,406
I mean, it's been like a decade
since Connor and l... You know.

1135
01:07:47,213 --> 01:07:50,649
But I see him again, and I am just right back
to where I was before.

1136
01:07:50,816 --> 01:07:54,047
My attending in med school used to say
that doctors never break up...

1137
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:58,520
...we just go into remission. We're naturally
drawn to the most hopeless patients.

1138
01:07:58,691 --> 01:08:01,592
The irredeemably screwed up.
The terminal cases.

1139
01:08:01,761 --> 01:08:05,754
- We get the point, Brad.
