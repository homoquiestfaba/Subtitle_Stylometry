Yeah, I missed you, too.

00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,637
Great! So then next year
you stay home!

42
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:25,540
- Maybe.
- Oh, come on, baby girl,

43
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:27,742
don't you think you're getting
a little old for that camp?

44
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,778
- If it's cause of Tommy...
- It's not.

45
00:03:30,812 --> 00:03:31,813
[Michelle] Well, if it is...

46
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:33,346
- It's not!
- I'm just saying,

47
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,850
it wouldn't kill you
to maybe dress a bit sexier

48
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:36,818
- every now and then.
- Okay, look, Mom!

49
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:39,954
Tommy is cute,
but he's not why I go there.

50
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:42,456
You know that.
So, please stop.

00:03:43,825 --> 00:03:45,392

You? Really?

00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,471
Sure!

60
00:04:31,506 --> 00:04:33,473
Don't I need like a permit?

61
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:34,742

Yes! Seatbelt.

- [seatbelt locks]
- [Michelle] Check, okay.

66
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,728
Hands at ten-two,
foot on the brake

67
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,563
and put the car into drive.

68
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:57,364
But che-check
your blind spot first.

69
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:58,566
And-and the mirror.

70
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,001
Oh, God!
You'll have to adjust those.

71
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:02,837
And the seat...
God, is it getting hot in here?

72
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,471
Wait!
But, don't forget to signal!

73
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:05,773
Mom!

74
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:07,008
Too much?

75
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,042
Okay.

76
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:20,688
Oh! Look at you. [sighs]

00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:23,758
Ah! [laughs]

78
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,893
You're doing great.

79
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:28,395
Okay, steady.

Libby, road! [breathes deeply]

81
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,401
- Mom!
- What?

82
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,738
It's just for
one of the vacant lots.

83
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:39,574
We talked about this!

84
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:41,709
Oh.

85
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:44,145
We're gonna need money
for college, baby girl.

86
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:47,447
The romance stories aren't
selling like they used to.

87
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,850
I know.

88
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:50,651
Betty said she's still
willing to show us

89
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:51,886
around at SUNY Adirondack.

90
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,089
SUNY.

91
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:56,791
[Michelle]
What? It's affordable.

92
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:59,126
[chuckles]
Yeah, affordable, huh?

93
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,494
What? Don't you dare!
It was a gift!

94
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:02,763
- Gi... gift?
- Yeah.

95
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:03,798
From who?

96
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:07,501
[sighs] Mm-mm.
You'll see

97
00:06:13,608 --> 00:06:15,943
- Um, whose...?
- Great job, baby girl!!!

98
00:06:15,977 --> 00:06:18,445

105

Mom?

106
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:31,626
Hello?

107
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:32,994
- What are you...?
- [John] Hey!

108
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,468
[Libby breathes deeply]

109
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:47,141
Holy crap.

110
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,851
[Michelle] I know.

111
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,719
I'm writing him constantly.

112
00:07:00,054 --> 00:07:01,689
Eww.

113
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:02,723
[Michelle] Hm-mm.

114
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:11,065
Who wears a speedo?

115
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:19,006
Libs, this is
my boyfriend, John.

116
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,242
Miss Wells,
[breathes deeply]

117
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:22,944
it's a pleasure
to finally meet you!

118
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,014
Libby? [giggles]

119
00:07:27,048 --> 00:07:28,049
Hey.

120
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,186
I hope you don't mind
that I'm here!

121
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,254
I know it's your Lake house

122
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:36,524
and I'm not trying to
take away time with your Mom.

123
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,592
So...

124
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:40,661
Oh! I've actually
got something for you.

125
00:07:40,695 --> 00:07:41,829
Can you give me just a minute?

126
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,002
You have a boyfriend?

127
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:49,170
I know!

128
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:51,672
Why didn't you tell me?

129
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:53,674
[scoffs]
I thought it was just a fling!

130
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,910
I mean, look at him.

131
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:58,546
Is he what you were "doing"
every time I called?

132
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:01,849
Okay.

133
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,551
This is for you.

134
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,992
Your mom told me

135
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,793
that you're really
into archeology.

136
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:20,968
This is the Navajo tribes'
"stone of life".

137
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:23,704
It's the only "object"
they really assign any value to

138
00:08:23,738 --> 00:08:26,207
outside of its utility.

139
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,976
And, if you look here,

140
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,779
the upside-down
crescent moon shape?

141
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:34,582
It's called a 'Naja'
by the Navajo,

142
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:39,720
but [chuckles] it's actually
Moorish in origin!

143
00:08:39,754 --> 00:08:46,327
It represents the Phoenician
goddess of fertility.

144
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,296
Basically,
this bracelet has origins

145
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:53,100
from the Western
and Eastern world

146
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:56,037
all the way back to the very
beginning of civilization.

147
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:58,639
So...

148
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,710
Thanks.

149
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:03,944
You're very welcome.

150
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:07,848
Oh, if you want

151
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:12,787
the gift receipt,
it's in the box.

152
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:18,926
Well, who's hungry?

153
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:41,949
[bangles clink]

154
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:47,254
[Libby breathing rapidly]

155
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,068
Hey
[breathes deeply]

156
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:04,972
[breathes deeply]
Yeah. Don't be a weirdo.

157
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:07,041
[breathes deeply] Please.

158
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:08,943
[John] Honey, dessert. What am I
gonna have for dessert?

159
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:10,411
[Michelle laughing]

160
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:13,781
[laughs] Hey!

161
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:14,815
Hi.

162
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,355
Hope you're hungry, baby girl!

163
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,629
You look nice.

164
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:32,099
You cooked?

165
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,100
Of course, I cooked!

166
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:36,170
Eh-eh-eh I'll get that.

167
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:37,271
- Oh, yeah?
- [John chuckles]

168
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,073
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

169
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:40,307
Mm-mm.

170
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:42,810
Oh, that tastes really good.

171
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:45,846
Mm-mm. [laughs]

172
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,383
[John] So, Libby?
How was camp?

173
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,818
Uh. It was okay.

174
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,319
- [John] Yeah?
- Yeah.

175
00:10:52,353 --> 00:10:54,922
I think it's getting like,
uh, a little routine.

176
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,160
How did you guys meet?

177
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:00,861
[Michelle breathes deeply]

178
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:02,329
I will let you
take that one.

179
00:11:02,363 --> 00:11:06,734
Well, uh, I-I came out
early this year

180
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:10,304
because some work needed
to be done to the back deck.

181
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,438
I swear!

182
00:11:12,473 --> 00:11:16,977
Anyways, I was outside
writing on the porch one day

183
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:20,848
when John just
kind of appeared!

184
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:24,752
[laughs] I... I've been
at the Lake all year.

185
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:27,421
I, uh, I'm studying
a few species here.

186
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,323
He's an aquatic geneticist!

187
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,325
- Wait, really?
- [John] Hm-mm. Yeah.

188
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,227
I'm part of
a small research team.

189
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,429
We're sort of scattered
around the region here.

190
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,131
What are you researching?

191
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:38,999
[John]
Mostly freshwater animals.

192
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:41,035
We're trying to solve
a problem in nature.

193
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:43,304
Hm-mm. Libs! [indistinct].

194
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:44,939
What problem?

195
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:45,973
Well

196
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:51,178
Can I borrow this, please?

197
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:53,847
- Of course.
- [John chuckles]

198
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:56,350
So the earth has
a finite amount of freshwater.

199
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,418
[water gurgles]

200
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:03,958
In fact, only 2.5%
of the Earth's water is fresh,

201
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:06,293
leaving 97.5%

202
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:09,430
- [clanking]
- as salt water.

203
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:14,435
And within those freshwater
ponds and streams,

204
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:17,505
and glaciers,
many, many species live.

205
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:20,975
Unfortunately,
due to continual increase

206
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:22,142
in the Earth's temperature,

207
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:26,347
there isn't enough rain to
supply these freshwater systems.

208
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:32,920
And there's more evaporation
in the oceans leaving a planet

209
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:34,355
[clanking]

210
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:36,323
with an overall
increasing level

211
00:12:36,357 --> 00:12:38,392
[clanking]

212
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,426
of salinity.

213
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:44,898
And now,
some of the species,

214
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:49,571
well, they can't survive
in such a rapidly changing world

215
00:12:49,604 --> 00:12:53,575
without some major adaptation.

216
00:12:53,608 --> 00:13:01,849
So, I am here
to speed up Mother Nature.

217
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,152
And

218
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,057
hopefully

219
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,425
in the end

220
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,395
[water flowing]

221
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:18,533
make it
so that certain species

222
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:22,036
can survive
in a saltwater world.

223
00:13:23,505 --> 00:13:26,206
[Michelle breathes deeply]

224
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:33,180
Hm-mm. So, basically,
he's saving the world.

225
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:34,281
[John] Oh, come on.

226
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:36,183
I'm definitely not. [laughs]

227
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:37,484
[Michelle laughs]

228
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,191
[John clears throat and coughs]

229
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:48,295
- Hon?
- [John coughs intensely]

230
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,440
[John] Oh, man.

231
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:01,275
Sorry. [coughs]

232
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:03,444
Ah, I coughed up
a lung there.

233
00:14:03,477 --> 00:14:04,945
You know that phrase.

234
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:07,047
- It's actually, well...
- Honey, honey.

235
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:09,216
[exhales] Mm.

236
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:16,256
[Libby gasps]

237
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:45,119
[Libby moans]

238
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:56,598
[Libby breathes deeply]

239
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,266
[clank]

240
00:15:01,636 --> 00:15:03,170
[in-can drink fizzes]

241
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:17,552
[Michelle] [moans] Ah!

242
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:23,691
[moaning] Aaaah!

243
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:26,594
[continues moaning
and breathing rapidly]

244
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:39,006
[floorboards creak]

245
00:15:49,717 --> 00:15:53,253
[continues moaning
and breathing rapidly]

246
00:16:04,766 --> 00:16:06,568
[bang]

247
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:08,202
[door hinges squeak]

248
00:16:19,514 --> 00:16:22,717
[water flowing]

249
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,722
[heavy footsteps]

250
00:16:49,611 --> 00:16:54,114
[tense music]

251
00:16:57,819 --> 00:17:00,320
[door hinges squeak]

252
00:17:04,258 --> 00:17:05,660
[door closes]

253
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:12,767
[Libby breathes deeply]

254
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,803
[birds chirping]

255
00:17:15,837 --> 00:17:18,205
- [banging]
- [Libby breathes deeply]

256
00:17:20,775 --> 00:17:22,209
[Michelle giggles and inhales]

257
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:23,778
[John] Oh, I like things
that are kind of wet.

258
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:24,812
- Oh, yeah.
- [John] Hm-mm.

259
00:17:24,846 --> 00:17:26,346
You're evil. [laughs]

260
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,481
[indistinct]. What?

261
00:17:27,515 --> 00:17:29,116
[Michelle]
[giggles] No, I didn't.

262
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:30,117
[John chuckles]

263
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,387
[giggles] Mm.
Scratch my arm.

264
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,421
Hm... mm.

265
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:40,127
Mm-hm.

266
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,130
- [far counter bangs]
- Oh. [shocked]

267
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:44,364
Morning, sunshine!

268
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:45,867
Morning.

269
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,135
How'd you sleep?

270
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:49,804
Well, thanks.

271
00:17:49,837 --> 00:17:51,338
You want some breakfast?

272
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:54,374
I was thinking we could
go for a hike later?

273
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:55,475
[chuckles] Mom?

274
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,844
[Michelle] What?

275
00:17:56,878 --> 00:17:58,546
It's the 28th.

276
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,180
Okay

277
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:01,516
August 28th!

278
00:18:03,551 --> 00:18:06,521
Oh. [chuckles]
We can go after breakfast.

279
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:12,392
Can John come?

280
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:17,565
Ahhh I-I don't know.

281
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,767
Okay, fine. Just us two.

282
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:22,704
[breathes deeply]
I'll explain later. Hm.

283
00:18:22,737 --> 00:18:24,237
- It's fine.
- [both kiss]

284
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:25,840
[Michelle] I'm gonna
make you some breakfast.

285
00:18:25,873 --> 00:18:28,308
- [both kiss]
- You'll love it.

286
00:18:28,342 --> 00:18:30,277
[heavy footsteps]

287
00:18:34,882 --> 00:18:37,317
[birds chirping]

288
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:41,556
So, what do you think
of John?

289
00:18:43,524 --> 00:18:44,859
Mom.

290
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:46,393
Ugh.

291
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:48,563
It's important to me
that you like him.

292
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,668
[sighs deeply]

293
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:56,203
[capsules clanking]

294
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,693
I don't have
anything this year.

295
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:22,396
Fine.

296
00:19:23,765 --> 00:19:24,766
What about Grandpa?

297
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:27,702
Mom!

298
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:29,604
It's been nine years, Libs!

299
00:19:29,637 --> 00:19:30,538
So?

300
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:32,472
Alright. I'm gonna
go back to the house.

301
00:19:32,507 --> 00:19:35,308
Fine. You never gave a shit,
anyways so...

302
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:38,445
Hey!

303
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:39,847
Hey, what?

304
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:42,315
You never have
anything nice for him.

305
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,251
And one year, you gave him
a roll of toilet paper!

306
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:47,755
[laughs] That was funny!
He was gassy!

307
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:49,456
Just go play
with your boyfriend.

308
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:56,463
Hm. I think I will.

309
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:57,899
No wonder
he gave me the house.

310
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:00,702
Excuse me?

311
00:20:02,804 --> 00:20:05,840
He gave you the house
because he loved you!

312
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:09,276
He loved you, Libby,
more than he ever loved me.

313
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:10,310
Yeah.
That's kind of my point.

314
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:11,846
No. No, Libby.
You don't get it.

315
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,881
He <i>never</i> loved me.

316
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:17,719
You wanna know why I don't
give him a note every year?

317
00:20:17,752 --> 00:20:18,820
You want to know why?

318
00:20:19,954 --> 00:20:21,723
Because after he died,

319
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:23,958
and I was cleaning out
this shithole house,

320
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:27,260
I found his divorce
agreement to Grandma.

321
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:28,963
He wrote to the lawyers
saying,

322
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:32,299
"She can have Michelle,
I'll take Marc."

323
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:35,435
That.

324
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:38,005
That was the last note.

325
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,008
That was the only note.

326
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:43,978
[heavy footsteps]

327
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:54,454
[insects chirping]

328
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:12,740
[gasps] Ow!

329
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:15,777
Ow! [groans softly]

330
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,079
[breathing deeply]

331
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:19,680
[John] No. Stop! Stop! Stop!

332
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:22,683
That's a Scolopendra!

333
00:21:23,818 --> 00:21:25,520
They're really rare!

334
00:21:25,553 --> 00:21:26,721
[gasps]

335
00:21:31,058 --> 00:21:32,359
Careful.

336
00:21:33,928 --> 00:21:35,362
Let's get back in there.

337
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:37,397
Alright, come on.

338
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,666
It bit me!

339
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:44,772
Well, I would guess, ah

340
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:49,010
It was protecting its offspring.

341
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:52,880
There we...

342
00:21:52,914 --> 00:21:54,715
Sorry, I didn't know
it was doing that.

343
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:58,052
That's all right.

344
00:21:58,085 --> 00:21:59,854
[Libby breathes deeply]

345
00:22:01,556 --> 00:22:03,724
[John breathes deeply]

346
00:22:03,758 --> 00:22:05,026
Where did she get you?

347
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,394
Right here.

348
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:08,596
[John] Let me see.

349
00:22:11,065 --> 00:22:12,399
Whoa!
I don't want to scare you,

350
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:13,901
but their bite is venomous.

351
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:33,588
Looks like
you're gonna be okay.

352
00:22:35,623 --> 00:22:38,559
Just put some ice on it
so it doesn't swell, okay?

353
00:22:38,593 --> 00:22:39,627
Okay.

354
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:45,533
What were you doing out here?

355
00:22:45,566 --> 00:22:48,069
Um, I like to come out here
after it rains.

356
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:52,039
See if anything gets unearthed.

357
00:22:52,073 --> 00:22:54,108
[water splashing]

358
00:22:55,776 --> 00:22:56,978
You?

359
00:22:59,446 --> 00:23:00,982
Came to check on you, actually.

360
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,918
Oh.

361
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:06,654
Everything okay?

362
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:09,891
Yeah. Fine.

363
00:23:09,924 --> 00:23:11,458
Hm-mm.

364
00:23:13,895 --> 00:23:16,463
I know it's not really
my business, but, uh

365
00:23:18,132 --> 00:23:19,867
your Mom came back
pretty upset.

366
00:23:23,671 --> 00:23:24,772
Oh.

367
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:32,079
I hope it's nothing
with me being here.

368
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:37,785
Maybe I should take off.

369
00:23:37,818 --> 00:23:39,486
Our team's almost done
around here.

370
00:23:39,486 --> 00:23:41,188
I can finish up at home.

371
00:23:42,056 --> 00:23:44,025
I don't want to cause
a rift between you two.

372
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,895
I know how much
she loves you.

373
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:51,732
[chuckles] You know,
the way she described you,

374
00:23:51,766 --> 00:23:53,500
the way she talked
about you

375
00:23:55,803 --> 00:23:57,672
it's what made me
fall in love with her.

376
00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:06,013
You love her?

377
00:24:08,582 --> 00:24:09,784
Very, very much.

378
00:24:12,954 --> 00:24:15,089
Well, I'll be in the basement
packing up my stuff.

379
00:24:16,223 --> 00:24:19,794
Oh, I have some of my things
down there for the low light.

380
00:24:19,827 --> 00:24:21,762
Sorry, I should
I should have told you.

381
00:24:21,796 --> 00:24:22,997
It's okay.

382
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:26,934
You know, you should stay.

383
00:24:30,805 --> 00:24:32,840
I'll go talk to her.

384
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:36,644
[John] Ah, I would maybe
give her a little bit.

385
00:24:36,677 --> 00:24:38,846
Last I checked,
she wasn't feeling real great.

386
00:24:47,955 --> 00:24:49,924
[loud whisper] Mom?

387
00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:52,560
[door hinges squeak]

388
00:25:00,768 --> 00:25:01,902
Ma?

389
00:25:01,936 --> 00:25:03,170
Hm-mm.

390
00:25:09,677 --> 00:25:10,945
[Michelle]
I'm not drinking.

391
00:25:12,947 --> 00:25:15,082
I've been good this summer.
I swear.

392
00:25:15,116 --> 00:25:17,618
[deep sigh] Hm.

393
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,088
Ah.

394
00:25:25,092 --> 00:25:27,795
[breathes deeply]

395
00:25:29,897 --> 00:25:30,998
What's wrong?

396
00:25:31,032 --> 00:25:32,833
[Michelle]
Ah. My stomach.

397
00:25:34,035 --> 00:25:35,269
Must've been my cooking.

398
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,838
[chuckles]

399
00:25:43,377 --> 00:25:46,180
I'm sorry, about before.

400
00:25:47,648 --> 00:25:49,650
I didn't know, so

401
00:25:49,683 --> 00:25:51,252
It's okay, baby girl.

402
00:25:53,054 --> 00:25:54,688
I'm sorry I told you.

403
00:25:56,657 --> 00:25:58,726
I know Pop-pop
meant a lot to you.

404
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,295
This doesn't change that.

405
00:26:04,932 --> 00:26:07,101
Did you find anything cool?

406
00:26:07,134 --> 00:26:08,636
- Sort of.
- [Michelle] Hm.

407
00:26:09,703 --> 00:26:11,005
You should show John!

408
00:26:12,206 --> 00:26:14,108
I think you two
have a lot in common.

409
00:26:16,744 --> 00:26:19,713
[inhales deeply]

410
00:26:19,747 --> 00:26:21,682
Libs, there's something
I got to tell you

411
00:26:21,715 --> 00:26:24,185
and I don't want you
to freak out.

412
00:26:26,387 --> 00:26:27,688
Okay.

413
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:29,990
Okay

414
00:26:30,024 --> 00:26:31,659
Ah, well

415
00:26:34,895 --> 00:26:38,966
John asked me to marry him,
and I said "yes." [chuckles]

416
00:26:38,999 --> 00:26:40,768
Well, "hell, yes"
to be exact.

417
00:26:40,801 --> 00:26:42,736
[chuckles]

418
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,205
What?

419
00:26:44,238 --> 00:26:46,340
I love him, Libby.

420
00:26:46,373 --> 00:26:48,075
I love him so much.

421
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:50,077
So, so much.

422
00:26:50,111 --> 00:26:52,146
He's amazing.

423
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:53,280
And I know you'll love him too.

424
00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:54,982
I promise you will.

425
00:26:57,351 --> 00:26:59,820
It's important to me
that you're okay with this.

426
00:27:01,122 --> 00:27:03,257
I need you to be okay,
baby girl. [exhales]

427
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:06,760
Please don't call me that.

428
00:27:08,796 --> 00:27:10,097
Okay.

429
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:15,836
I'm happy for you guys.

430
00:27:17,705 --> 00:27:18,806
I love you, Mom.

431
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:19,874
I want you to be happy.

432
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:26,413
Oh, I love you, baby...
I love you, Libs!

433
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:29,116
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

434
00:27:30,885 --> 00:27:33,354
[inhales deeply]
[chuckles]

435
00:27:35,222 --> 00:27:36,991
Just one more thing.

436
00:27:37,024 --> 00:27:38,759
Wh-what?

437
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:41,862
John doesn't really know
that I'm 42.

438
00:27:41,896 --> 00:27:42,897
What do you mean?

439
00:27:44,365 --> 00:27:48,169
He thinks I'm 35?

440
00:27:48,202 --> 00:27:49,170
Mom! That so...

441
00:27:49,203 --> 00:27:50,738
[Michelle] I know,
I know, I know!

442
00:27:50,738 --> 00:27:53,107
I'm-I'm gonna tell him.
I-I've been meaning to, just

443
00:27:56,143 --> 00:27:58,345
I-I can't lose him, Libs.

444
00:28:00,014 --> 00:28:02,149
I just, I can't.

445
00:28:02,183 --> 00:28:03,751
Hey, you won't.

446
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:06,453
You're incredible, so

447
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:09,423
[Michelle sighs]

448
00:28:10,424 --> 00:28:12,026
Hey

449
00:28:14,828 --> 00:28:16,030
I gotta... I should

450
00:28:16,063 --> 00:28:18,866
I should clean up. Yeah.

451
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:20,000
- Yeah.
- [Libby clears throat]

452
00:28:42,223 --> 00:28:43,891
[zipper screeching open]

453
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:25,199
[Libby breathes deeply]

454
00:30:01,168 --> 00:30:03,237
[door hinges squeak]

455
00:30:17,184 --> 00:30:18,285
[John] Hello?

456
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,987
[Libby] Ah. It's me.

457
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,255
[John] Oh, hey!

458
00:30:21,288 --> 00:30:24,058
But, turn that light off, yeah,
I'll-I'll come and get you.

459
00:30:31,899 --> 00:30:35,035
Hey, what an awesome surprise!

460
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,472
I tried knocking.
I'm really sorry.

461
00:30:38,506 --> 00:30:39,541
Oh, it's okay.

462
00:30:39,574 --> 00:30:42,042
I'll be, uh, the humidifiers,
they get really loud,

463
00:30:42,076 --> 00:30:45,079
so sometimes I don't hear.

464
00:30:45,112 --> 00:30:46,548
How's your Mom?

465
00:30:46,581 --> 00:30:49,283
[gasps] She's fine. Yeah.

466
00:30:49,316 --> 00:30:50,451
[John] Good.

467
00:30:50,484 --> 00:30:53,287
Um, I brought you
something to drink, so

468
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,556
Thank you.

469
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:58,425
Ah, I can't, uh,
I can't do the sodium.

470
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:03,665
Bad ticker.
But thank you.

471
00:31:03,698 --> 00:31:05,567
Hm-mm.
[whispers] Yeah.

472
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,201
[John] So, uh

473
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,606
you want to check out
my craziness?

474
00:31:18,379 --> 00:31:20,180
Right this way.
Come here.

475
00:31:23,585 --> 00:31:25,553
[water gurgling]

476
00:31:25,587 --> 00:31:26,588
Uhh.

477
00:31:27,988 --> 00:31:29,390
Uhh.

478
00:31:29,423 --> 00:31:31,458
What are those?

479
00:31:31,492 --> 00:31:33,994
[smirks] Lampreys.

480
00:31:34,027 --> 00:31:35,195
[Libby] Really?

481
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:37,965
Yeah. You're familiar?

482
00:31:38,966 --> 00:31:40,033
Yeah. Slightly.

483
00:31:41,335 --> 00:31:42,570
I figured you might be.

484
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:47,074
These little guys
are 360 million years old.

485
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:50,110
Right up your alley!

486
00:31:50,144 --> 00:31:51,478
Ah, yeah. They're, um

487
00:31:51,513 --> 00:31:53,447
mentioned a lot
in the fossil record.

488
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,516
Hm-mm.

489
00:31:55,517 --> 00:31:57,685
Yeah, these little guys
have survived it all.

490
00:31:59,353 --> 00:32:01,188
Meteors

491
00:32:01,221 --> 00:32:03,323
ice ages

492
00:32:03,357 --> 00:32:06,193
ever increasing and decreasing
salinity levels.

493
00:32:07,762 --> 00:32:11,465
In fact, they are
the only aquatic species

494
00:32:11,498 --> 00:32:15,002
to be found in the fresh
and saltwater records.

495
00:32:15,035 --> 00:32:16,303
Huh.

496
00:32:16,336 --> 00:32:18,205
They're parasitic.

497
00:32:18,238 --> 00:32:21,175
See the mouths? The teeth?

498
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:24,011
They latch onto their prey.

499
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:27,247
And they can adapt
to their host.

500
00:32:28,616 --> 00:32:32,386
So, even if they encounter
anadromous species

501
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:37,057
like Smelt,
or Salmon, or Bass,

502
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,660
spawning
in a freshwater pool,

503
00:32:38,693 --> 00:32:43,497
or stream, or river,
they can attach

504
00:32:43,531 --> 00:32:45,332
and then adapt.

505
00:32:45,365 --> 00:32:49,303
So even if they
end up in the sea

506
00:32:49,336 --> 00:32:50,437
they'll survive.

507
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:55,777
No other species on Earth

508
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,244
that can do that.

509
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,113
Not one.

510
00:33:02,316 --> 00:33:04,652
[water bubbing]

511
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,528
It's beautiful.

512
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,067
Beautiful?

513
00:33:22,436 --> 00:33:24,371
Hm-mm. [chuckles]

514
00:33:26,139 --> 00:33:27,207
Yeah.

515
00:33:30,344 --> 00:33:32,079
You're kind of a-a weird dude.

516
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,548
[John laughs]

517
00:33:35,617 --> 00:33:37,685
Yeah, I guess I am.

518
00:33:39,253 --> 00:33:40,454
But, I mean,

519
00:33:40,487 --> 00:33:41,789
weird is cool, right?

520
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,294
Yeah.

521
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:54,101
[Libby] Um

522
00:33:54,101 --> 00:33:56,604
So, I heard that you and
my mom are getting married?

523
00:34:00,474 --> 00:34:01,776
Yeah, yeah. Ah

524
00:34:05,345 --> 00:34:06,748
She told you, huh?

525
00:34:06,781 --> 00:34:08,716
Yep.

526
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,350
Yeah, we are.

527
00:34:13,688 --> 00:34:16,223
Libby, she's very,
very special to me.

528
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:19,493
Good.

529
00:34:21,161 --> 00:34:22,429
[John chuckles]

530
00:34:23,598 --> 00:34:25,600
We have to celebrate!

531
00:34:25,633 --> 00:34:27,134
You can have a party!

532
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:28,468
You can invite
some of your girlfriends.

533
00:34:28,503 --> 00:34:29,537
Ah, I don't... [chuckles]

534
00:34:29,571 --> 00:34:31,305
Maybe. [chuckles]

535
00:34:33,373 --> 00:34:34,809
Should I go check on your mom?
Or-or...

536
00:34:34,842 --> 00:34:37,311
Nah, no, no.
She's um, she's fine.

537
00:34:37,344 --> 00:34:39,379
Just let her sleep.

538
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:40,882
[John] Okay.

539
00:34:40,915 --> 00:34:42,550
In that case

540
00:34:45,687 --> 00:34:48,155
you want to help me pull
some samples from the lake?

541
00:34:48,155 --> 00:34:50,157
[water bubbling]

542
00:34:51,726 --> 00:34:53,695
Oh, okay.

543
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:04,772
How old are you?

544
00:35:06,507 --> 00:35:07,675
[John] How old do I look?

545
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:10,243
[Libby] Twenty-five.

546
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:12,412
Ho-oh, thank you.

547
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:13,514
[Libby] Twenty-six?

548
00:35:14,749 --> 00:35:15,783
Thirty.

549
00:35:15,817 --> 00:35:17,217
Oh.

550
00:35:19,486 --> 00:35:21,254
Where did you go to school?

551
00:35:21,288 --> 00:35:25,225
Uh, a little, private school
that no one has ever heard of.

552
00:35:25,258 --> 00:35:27,629
It probably explains
why I'm so well-funded.

553
00:35:27,662 --> 00:35:30,397
[boat groans]

554
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:34,267
Can you hold my legs
for a second?

555
00:35:35,837 --> 00:35:36,904
Yep.

556
00:35:38,873 --> 00:35:39,841
[John] Right there.

557
00:35:39,874 --> 00:35:41,676
[water splashing]

558
00:35:41,709 --> 00:35:42,810
Come on.

559
00:35:44,912 --> 00:35:47,247
- Yeah.
- [cage thuds]

560
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,517
Well, I'm applying
Early Decision

561
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,218
to Cambridge next year.

562
00:35:52,352 --> 00:35:53,453
Really?

563
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:55,657
[Libby] Yeah, I got, uh,
a perfect score on my PSATs

564
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:57,491
and, um, my counselor says

565
00:35:57,525 --> 00:35:59,961
I'm probably gonna be
Valedictorian, so

566
00:35:59,994 --> 00:36:01,963
Libby, that's amazing!

567
00:36:01,996 --> 00:36:02,964
Thanks. [chuckles]

568
00:36:02,997 --> 00:36:04,565
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

569
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:05,432
That's great.

570
00:36:05,465 --> 00:36:08,536
Yeah.
It's-it's really far but, um,

571
00:36:08,569 --> 00:36:11,706
the archeology programs there
are like the best in the world.

572
00:36:11,739 --> 00:36:13,373
- Yeah.
- And like the history there

573
00:36:13,407 --> 00:36:16,611
is just so awesome. So

574
00:36:19,312 --> 00:36:20,447
Very awesome.

575
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,649
Hm-mm, thanks.

576
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,451
Does your mom know?

577
00:36:25,653 --> 00:36:26,688
Kind of holding off on that.

578
00:36:26,721 --> 00:36:29,757
She's so attached.

579
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:30,758
[John] Right.

580
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:31,959
- Yeah.
- [John] Well

581
00:36:33,695 --> 00:36:34,829
Thank you. [giggles]

582
00:36:36,396 --> 00:36:38,733
Yeah, she wants me
to stay here,

583
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:42,269
but the state programs
are so awful.

584
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:43,270
Ahh!

585
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:46,373

[breathes deeply]
I'm sorry.

589
00:37:05,492 --> 00:37:06,861
Are you kidding me?
I'm sorry!

590
00:37:07,662 --> 00:37:09,296
I didn't want you
to ruin your dress.

591
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:10,531
And I-I just reacted.

592
00:37:10,565 --> 00:37:11,699
I didn't really know
what to do.

593
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:13,935
[Libby panting]

594
00:37:13,968 --> 00:37:17,772
Hey, hey, Libby, Libby.

595
00:37:17,805 --> 00:37:18,806
Listen

596
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:21,776
it's okay!

597
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:23,410
We're both scientists.

598
00:37:23,443 --> 00:37:24,411
Right?

599
00:37:24,444 --> 00:37:25,445
Hm-mm.

600
00:37:25,479 --> 00:37:27,582
This is totally normal.

601
00:37:27,615 --> 00:37:30,551
Look, it's
it's no big deal.

602
00:37:30,585 --> 00:37:33,588
[tense music]

603
00:37:38,726 --> 00:37:40,460

[Libby breathing rapidly]

606

610
00:38:27,909 --> 00:38:29,376
Are you okay?

Libby?

614
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:50,731
- Hey, Libby?
- I'm in the shower.

615
00:38:50,765 --> 00:38:52,099
Thank you.

616
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:53,835
Okay. Sorry.

617
00:38:55,503 --> 00:38:56,838
Just checking.

Libby?

660
00:47:30,317 --> 00:47:32,186
What are you doing out here?

661
00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:33,521
What are you doing out here?

662
00:47:35,623 --> 00:47:38,192
I don't know.
I just woke up out here.

663
00:47:38,225 --> 00:47:39,527
Ah, I saw you!

664
00:47:39,561 --> 00:47:41,495
I saw you walk into the lake!

665
00:47:41,529 --> 00:47:42,597
- What?
- Right here.

666
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:45,933
I saw you walk into the Lake.
Towards this like light!

667
00:47:47,368 --> 00:47:52,139
[scoffs]
I'm-I'm pretty dry.

668
00:47:52,172 --> 00:47:53,641
What?

669
00:47:55,543 --> 00:47:57,277
Libby, I should have
mentioned this earlier,

670
00:47:57,311 --> 00:47:58,613
and I'm really sorry.

671
00:48:00,682 --> 00:48:03,350
I suffer from somnambulism.

672
00:48:05,018 --> 00:48:06,220
It's sleepwalking.

673
00:48:07,555 --> 00:48:10,090
I'm really sorry
if I scared you.

674
00:48:13,695 --> 00:48:14,796
I feel like everything
that I have done

675
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:18,165
since you got here has been
an absolute catastrophe!

676
00:48:21,101 --> 00:48:22,570
I have this way of

677
00:48:26,073 --> 00:48:28,108
I just fuck everything up.

678
00:48:29,376 --> 00:48:31,513
Except for my research.

679
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:39,186
It's the one time
that I-I like I work.

680
00:48:40,588 --> 00:48:42,022
Does that make sense?

681
00:48:47,762 --> 00:48:49,062
Look, please,
come back inside.

682
00:48:49,096 --> 00:48:51,498
I got to keep
one of you healthy. I...

[John exhales]

685
00:48:54,301 --> 00:48:56,504
Do you always lock the doors
when you sleepwalk?

[Michelle]
Libby, in here!

692
00:49:25,667 --> 00:49:27,367
[Libby] Mom?

693
00:49:27,401 --> 00:49:28,603
What's wrong?

694
00:49:28,636 --> 00:49:30,103
Libby
[breathes deeply]

695
00:49:30,137 --> 00:49:32,574
I need you to take the car,
and go into town,

696
00:49:32,607 --> 00:49:34,408
and get me medicine.
Okay?

697
00:49:34,441 --> 00:49:38,613
Something called
cyclizine and Ginger Root.

698
00:49:38,646 --> 00:49:40,147
And whatever else.

699
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:42,149
- Everything!
- Mom, I can't drive!

700
00:49:42,182 --> 00:49:44,284
If somebody pulls you over,
tell 'em it's an emergency.

701
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:46,320
Well then, we-we need to
call an ambulance!

702
00:49:46,353 --> 00:49:48,055
[Michelle]
[labored breathing] Oh, God.

703
00:49:49,389 --> 00:49:51,793
It's not really an emergency.

704
00:49:51,826 --> 00:49:54,061
- What?
- [Michelle] I

705
00:49:54,061 --> 00:49:55,496
Mom?

706
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:57,665
I need you to also get me
a pregnancy test.

707
00:49:59,567 --> 00:50:02,302
- [whispers] Mom!
- Libby! Go! Please!

708
00:50:02,336 --> 00:50:03,237
[Libby] Why can't John do it?

709
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:05,472
Because John's on
one of his marathon jogs.

710
00:50:05,507 --> 00:50:07,140
He won't be back for hours.

711
00:50:07,174 --> 00:50:08,610
Please, just go, Libby.

712
00:50:08,643 --> 00:50:09,644
I need something.

713
00:50:09,677 --> 00:50:11,044
Marley's coming in an hour.

714
00:50:11,078 --> 00:50:12,079
I can just wait for her
and then

715
00:50:12,112 --> 00:50:14,516
Uh, Marley's come...

716
00:50:14,549 --> 00:50:16,116
[groans in pain] Ahhh!

717
00:50:16,149 --> 00:50:18,385

- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

Excuse me, Miss.

725
00:51:24,852 --> 00:51:28,221

730
00:52:00,622 --> 00:52:02,356
Hey!

731
00:52:02,389 --> 00:52:03,423
Hey!

732
00:52:04,592 --> 00:52:06,193
- Did you see?
- Yep. Wow.

733
00:52:06,226 --> 00:52:07,929
Yeah, okay.

734
00:52:07,962 --> 00:52:09,229
[heavy footsteps]

735
00:52:13,568 --> 00:52:16,269
[John inhales]

736
00:52:16,303 --> 00:52:18,573
Excuse me.

737
00:52:19,874 --> 00:52:24,779
Okay. I got you everything
you asked for.

738
00:52:24,812 --> 00:52:28,549
It's Ginger root,
cyclizine, and, um, the

739
00:52:29,951 --> 00:52:31,318
and the, um

740
00:52:34,689 --> 00:52:36,289
Oh. It's okay, Libby.

741
00:52:37,357 --> 00:52:38,926
We talked.

742
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,528
I know.

743
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:45,399
[Michelle] Thanks, baby.
Thanks, Libs.

744
00:52:47,669 --> 00:52:50,370
Do you need help
getting to the bathroom?

745
00:52:50,404 --> 00:52:51,839
[Michelle] No, no.
Not right now.

746
00:52:52,907 --> 00:52:55,943
John?
[breathes deeply]

747
00:53:01,448 --> 00:53:03,383
I'll be alright.
Go hang out with Marley.

748
00:53:05,753 --> 00:53:07,487
Maybe I should stay.

749
00:53:07,522 --> 00:53:08,823
[Michelle] No, I'm fine.

750
00:53:09,857 --> 00:53:11,526
John will take care of me.

751
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,294
I think that I should stay.

752
00:53:14,327 --> 00:53:16,531
Lib! Please!

753
00:53:16,564 --> 00:53:17,899
Marley's downstairs.

754
00:53:17,932 --> 00:53:18,966
I'm tired.

755
00:53:21,268 --> 00:53:22,537
[Michelle breathes deeply]

756
00:53:28,643 --> 00:53:29,777
It's okay.

757
00:53:30,978 --> 00:53:32,446
I'll take care of her.

758
00:53:34,549 --> 00:53:35,817
Promise.

759
00:53:37,051 --> 00:53:40,287
[tense music]

760
00:53:44,058 --> 00:53:45,727
Go hang out
with your friend.

761
00:53:49,463 --> 00:53:50,565
She looks fun.

762
00:53:52,533 --> 00:53:53,534
What?

763
00:53:55,837 --> 00:53:56,871
I got this!

764
00:53:58,806 --> 00:53:59,974
Don't worry!

765
00:54:02,877 --> 00:54:04,979
Use the card
if you want to order something.

766
00:54:06,681 --> 00:54:07,749
Okay.

767
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:10,685
[Michelle] Hm-mm.

768
00:54:12,385 --> 00:54:13,654
If you need me,
just yell.

769
00:54:13,688 --> 00:54:14,922
Will do!

770
00:54:22,563 --> 00:54:24,331
[door hinges squeak]

771
00:54:26,834 --> 00:54:29,837
[tense music]

772
00:54:36,811 --> 00:54:38,880
[Marley chuckles and sighs]

773
00:54:38,913 --> 00:54:39,914
Don't say it.

774
00:54:40,748 --> 00:54:43,416
- Don't!
- He's so hot. Oh, my God!

775
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:44,986
- Eeeek!
- Sshh.

776
00:54:47,121 --> 00:54:48,388
Is your mom okay?

777
00:54:49,891 --> 00:54:50,892
I don't know.

778
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:54,361
She thinks
that she is pregnant.

779
00:54:54,394 --> 00:54:55,530
Wait, what?

780
00:54:55,563 --> 00:54:56,764
- Momma-Dukes is preggo?
- Hm-mm.

781
00:54:56,798 --> 00:54:57,999
Oh, smells!

782
00:54:58,032 --> 00:55:00,400
Okay, so you're going to have
like a little brother or sister.

783
00:55:00,433 --> 00:55:01,969
Well, hopefully,
not a little sister though.

784
00:55:02,003 --> 00:55:03,905
That'll be annoying. [gasps]
Oh, a little boy though.

785
00:55:03,938 --> 00:55:04,939
He's gonna have like his thing

786
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:05,873
- all over the place...
- Marley!

787
00:55:05,907 --> 00:55:07,008
Although he'll probably
be pretty cute.

788
00:55:07,041 --> 00:55:09,376
Filter. Right now.

789
00:55:09,409 --> 00:55:10,945
Yeah. Okay.

790
00:55:10,978 --> 00:55:14,115
- Sorry. I'm done.
- [Libby sighs]

791
00:55:14,148 --> 00:55:17,384
So, tell me,
why is John such a freak?

792
00:55:20,988 --> 00:55:22,056
[Libby breathes deeply]

793
00:55:22,089 --> 00:55:23,925
Okay.

794
00:55:23,958 --> 00:55:29,429
[whispers] So, last night,
I saw him walk into the lake.

795
00:55:29,462 --> 00:55:32,133
Like completely
towards this like,

796
00:55:32,166 --> 00:55:34,401
orange light at the bottom.

797
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:36,904
Really?

798
00:55:36,938 --> 00:55:39,807
And I saw him
drink his own sweat...

799
00:55:39,841 --> 00:55:40,842
Ewwww!

800
00:55:42,977 --> 00:55:45,412
[whispers]
And he grabbed me.

801
00:55:45,412 --> 00:55:46,581
What?

802
00:55:46,614 --> 00:55:48,015
Like Donald Trump,
he grabbed me.

803
00:55:48,049 --> 00:55:49,951
Jesus.
Did you tell your mom?

804
00:55:49,984 --> 00:55:53,888
No! She's head-over-heels
in love with him.

805
00:55:53,921 --> 00:55:55,422
Like psycho-girlfriend
in love with him.

806
00:55:55,455 --> 00:55:59,927
Like [breathes deeply]
Jaime-Savard in love with him.

807
00:55:59,961 --> 00:56:01,762
Oh, God.

808
00:56:01,796 --> 00:56:03,463
Okay. Still,
you need to talk to her.

809
00:56:03,496 --> 00:56:05,633
Or call the cops!

810
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:06,534
I know.

811
00:56:06,567 --> 00:56:10,905
Um hey, can you
stay here tonight? Please.

812
00:56:10,938 --> 00:56:12,740
[inhales]
Okay, I'm going to sound

813
00:56:12,773 --> 00:56:14,842
like the worst friend ever,
but I can't.

814
00:56:14,876 --> 00:56:16,844
My Dad has this
'Behind the Book' charity event,

815
00:56:16,878 --> 00:56:18,546
and he has me working
live stream

816
00:56:18,579 --> 00:56:20,581
'cause he just can't get
anything, right?

817
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:24,085
But you should come.

818
00:56:24,118 --> 00:56:25,887
You need to get
out of this house.

819
00:56:27,622 --> 00:56:29,123
No, I can't leave her alone.

820
00:56:29,156 --> 00:56:30,157
Okay, okay.

821
00:56:30,191 --> 00:56:32,660
Well, what if I go up there
and tell Michelle?

822
00:56:35,897 --> 00:56:37,164
[whispers] I don't know.

823
00:56:37,198 --> 00:56:40,034
He didn't really grab me,
but I was-I was bleeding.

824
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:41,602
- Does that make me...
- Okay, no, Libs.

825
00:56:41,636 --> 00:56:43,037
Fuck that. I'm gonna
go tell her.

826
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:47,174
[heavy footsteps]

827
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:50,945
[sighs] Wait, he grabbed you
while you were bleeding?

828
00:56:53,214 --> 00:56:55,583
[mouths] What the fuck!

829
00:56:55,616 --> 00:56:58,619
[heavy footsteps]

830
00:57:06,093 --> 00:57:08,095
<i>Michelle?</i>

831
00:57:08,129 --> 00:57:10,731
[mumbling]

832
00:57:53,541 --> 00:57:55,176
[Libby exhales]

833
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:05,886
[child laughing on TV]

834
00:58:07,154 --> 00:58:08,189
Hm-mm.

835
00:58:11,292 --> 00:58:12,860
- [John] Mm.
- [Michelle giggles]

836
00:58:12,893 --> 00:58:15,763
- [John chuckles]
- Can you scratch my arm?

837
00:58:22,703 --> 00:58:24,572
- [John] Hm-mm.
- [live chatter on TV]

838
00:58:24,605 --> 00:58:26,273
Where's Marley?

839
00:58:26,307 --> 00:58:28,175
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

840
00:58:28,209 --> 00:58:30,644
Marley left a while ago.

841
00:58:30,678 --> 00:58:31,879
And why didn't you wake me?

842
00:58:31,912 --> 00:58:33,614
- [Michelle] Well, we tried.
- [John] Hm-mm.

843
00:58:33,647 --> 00:58:35,649
[Michelle]
You were passed out.

844
00:58:35,683 --> 00:58:36,951
Are you feeling okay?

845
00:58:38,219 --> 00:58:39,587
I'm fine.

846
00:58:40,621 --> 00:58:41,622
You?

847
00:58:45,092 --> 00:58:46,093
[John] Go ahead.

848
00:58:46,127 --> 00:58:47,128
Mom?

849
00:58:48,596 --> 00:58:51,265
We're pregnant. [chuckles]

850
00:58:51,298 --> 00:58:53,034
Oh.

851
00:58:53,067 --> 00:58:54,201
Oh?

852
00:58:55,703 --> 00:58:57,638
Congrats?

853
00:58:57,671 --> 00:58:59,673
[Michelle exhales]

854
00:58:59,707 --> 00:59:02,009
Libby, I-I need you
to be okay with this.

855
00:59:03,277 --> 00:59:04,712
[whispers] I'm really scared.

856
00:59:04,745 --> 00:59:05,846
[whispers] You're scared?

857
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:06,881
Yeah.

858
00:59:08,049 --> 00:59:09,083
Did Marley talk to you?

859
00:59:09,116 --> 00:59:10,117
Yes!

860
00:59:10,151 --> 00:59:11,952
Why would you tell her that?

861
00:59:11,986 --> 00:59:12,953
What?

862
00:59:12,987 --> 00:59:14,622
He apologized.

863
00:59:14,622 --> 00:59:15,656
He just reacted.

864
00:59:15,689 --> 00:59:18,659
- It was a mistake!
- Mom. No, Mommy! He licked it.

865
00:59:18,692 --> 00:59:20,995
- What?
- He

866
00:59:21,028 --> 00:59:22,363
He licked it.

867
00:59:22,396 --> 00:59:24,365
Oh, God.

868
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:26,934
I swear, every time, Liberty!

869
00:59:26,967 --> 00:59:28,869
What do you mean, every...?
What... Every time?

870
00:59:28,903 --> 00:59:32,373
Every time I date someone,
you come up with some BS.

871
00:59:32,406 --> 00:59:33,808
It was cute
when you were a kid.

872
00:59:33,841 --> 00:59:35,209
But, not anymore!

873
00:59:35,242 --> 00:59:38,813
I'm done putting my life
on hold for your feelings.

874
00:59:39,814 --> 00:59:42,883
John isn't going anywhere!

875
00:59:45,219 --> 00:59:46,187
- Really?
- [Michelle] In fact, I think

876
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:47,254
you should apologize.

877
00:59:47,288 --> 00:59:48,856
- No, no, no, no, no...
- No, she should apologize!

878
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:52,359
Babe, it's fine.

879
00:59:52,393 --> 00:59:54,361
Really.

880
00:59:54,395 --> 00:59:57,198
- Okay?
- Hm-mm. Hm-mm.

881
00:59:57,231 --> 00:59:59,667
[John]
If we're going to be a family,

882
00:59:59,667 --> 01:00:03,370
we have to learn
how to forgive and forget.

883
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:05,873
Right, Libs?

884
01:00:08,275 --> 01:00:10,878
[dramatic music]

885
01:00:10,911 --> 01:00:12,780
You're a freak.

886
01:00:12,813 --> 01:00:13,614
- Mom! Get off of him.
- What?

887
01:00:13,647 --> 01:00:15,282
- Hey, okay.
- Get off of him, now!

888
01:00:15,316 --> 01:00:16,817
Get off of him, now!

889
01:00:16,851 --> 01:00:18,252
- Get out of our house. Get out!
- Libby! Stop it, Libs!

890
01:00:18,285 --> 01:00:19,653
[Michelle slaps Libby]

891
01:00:19,687 --> 01:00:22,623
[Libby breathing rapidly]

892
01:00:24,058 --> 01:00:25,359
[Michelle] Are you okay?

893
01:00:25,392 --> 01:00:27,061
- I'm fine.
- I'm so sorry.

894
01:00:27,094 --> 01:00:29,997
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm so sorry.

895
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:31,699
She's not 35, by the way.

896
01:00:31,732 --> 01:00:33,200
- Libby!
- She's 42.

897
01:00:33,234 --> 01:00:35,669
So, sure hope you weren't
planning on having another one.

898
01:00:38,339 --> 01:00:39,773
I-I meant to tell you.

899
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,208
I'm I'm so sorry.

900
01:00:42,343 --> 01:00:44,812
John?

901
01:00:44,845 --> 01:00:47,448
Babe? Please say something.

902
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:49,350
Babe?

903
01:00:49,383 --> 01:00:52,153
Babe? Please, don't be mad.

904
01:00:52,186 --> 01:00:54,889
Babe? Please. John!

905
01:00:54,922 --> 01:00:57,358
Let. Go.

906
01:00:57,391 --> 01:00:59,793
[Michelle breathing rapidly]

907
01:01:03,831 --> 01:01:05,032
Mom?

908
01:01:06,734 --> 01:01:09,069
[angrily]
How dare you!
