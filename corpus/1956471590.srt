I brought you some coffee.

103
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,386
Oh, I can't.
I'm off caffeine, remember?

104
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,088
That's right.
Caffeine is so toxic.

105
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,456

I forgot.

talked about this.

Just because all the
other kids are in therapy

110
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,400
does not mean you need to be.

111
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:33,401

112
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:34,735

113
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:37,371
you are just as well-adjusted...

114
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:39,106
as anyone else your age.

115
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,609
Maybe more so.

116
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:46,914
Unless there's something
you haven't told me.

117
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,115
I mean, is there?

118
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,116
No.

119
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,384
Are you sure?

120
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:51,385
Yeah.

121
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:52,620
I mean...

122
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:54,021
you just don't understand

123
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:56,857
how hard it is to be
a senior these days, Mom.

124
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,833
So you think I should
pull a Frida Kahlo

125
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,868
over the fact
that he didn't call me?

126
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,970
Maybe he felt too vulnerable.

127
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:21,549
What the... Can you believe this?

128
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,488
How bad are my circles?

129
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,156
Very Kate Moss
during heroin chic.

130
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,525
My mother kept me up
all night last night

131
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,160
obsessing over whether
she should marry Irving

132
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,628
now that he asked her
to sign a prenup.

133
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:35,929
What did you advise?

134
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:37,164
I told her to hold out for more.

135
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,166
Marrying money is the only
thing she does well.

136
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,869
Why should she
sell herself short?

137
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:46,774
Curiously strong mint?

138
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,480
So now that you
and Chad have hooked up,

139
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:53,714
do you think you're going out

140
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,882
or just having sex?

141
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,718
I don't know.
I guess I should ask him.

142
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,020
What about you and Louie,
or you and Petrus?

143
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:03,657
Are you... going out
or just having sex?

144
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:05,125
We're definitely going out.

145
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,193
We're going way out.

146
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:08,562
Are you sure Petrus isn't a fag?

147
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:12,533
Yes, I'm sure.
He's just European.

148
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,535
Oh, crap, you guys.
We should go.

149
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:18,672
I respect your opinion, sir,

150
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:19,940
and I just can't fathom

151
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,109
why you would give me
such a low grade.

152
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:23,577
An A-minus?

153
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:26,179
Well, yeah. It totally
brings down my average,

154
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,215
and I fully intend on
getting into Yale, sir.

155
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,551
Hey, Nell.
Yeah, whatever.

156
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:32,019
"Yeah, whatever"?

157
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:34,221
Nell, every guy in this
school is hot for you.

158
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,223
Hey.
Darling.

159
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:39,593
And Petrus here
is missing a chromosome.

160
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:41,194
Why are you such a freak?

161
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:43,096
I'm not into beefcake.

162
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:47,200
Time management, girls.
Time management.

163
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,703
All right, let's wipe our minds

164
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:51,639
clear of fantasy,
if that's possible,

165
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:53,607
and get down to reality.

166
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:56,577
Jennifer Simon,

167
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,880
what did you do
to get into college today?

168
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:03,183
Well, I explored
cross-culture communication

169
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,218
with my maid, Maria Josefa.

170
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:08,556
Hmm. Good try, but, uh,
a bit transparent.

171
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,558
College admission committees
are trained

172
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:12,025
to sniff out bullshit.

173
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:13,661
Not that we couldn't blow
smoke in that direction,

174
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:14,928
that's what I'm here for,

175
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:16,864
but we have to start
with the basis of reality.

176
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:17,865
Anyone else?

177
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:20,033
Yeah, uh... well,

178
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,769
Senator Dimatto had dinner

179
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,604
at my parents' house last night,

180
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:26,640
and, uh, I got him to
write me a recommendation.

181
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:28,542
Ah. Now that's more like it.

182
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:29,777
Now, that's using your assets.

183
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,580
You mean your father's assets,

184
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,247
right? Yeah? Hmm?

185
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:36,283
Uh, what about you,
Mr. Rockefeller?

186
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,851
Rockefeller?

187
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:40,153
Do you plan to take
the SATs again?

188
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,288
I've told you.

189
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,891
I don't use
the name Rockefeller.

190
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:45,092
I go by Lipschitz.

191
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,327
Well, Henry D.
Rockefeller is a legacy.

192
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,598
Uh, Henry Lipschitz is, uh, not.

193
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,800
So I hope when the time comes,

194
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,569
there'll be no confusion what
name you put on your application.

195
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:58,138
He changed his name
freshman year.

196
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:00,073
So Emilio Estevez.

197
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:01,975
All right. Now let's begin

198
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,344
by reading the introduction
to my book,

199
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,013
warm off the press,

200
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,981
and I think it's an easy read

201
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:11,151
and very easy to understand,
I assure you.

202
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:13,621
And please take note
of the title:

203
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:16,323
Getting In.
Shall we begin?

204
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,025
Stream Hodsell.

205
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,594
"In my 15 years of experience

206
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:21,629

215
00:09:46,854 --> 00:09:48,656
Hey, gorgeous.

216
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:51,091
Hi.

217
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,661
Why don't you meet me
in the equipment closet

218
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:54,795
in a couple of minutes?

219
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,129
But I have calculus.

220
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:57,130
I know.
Why?

221
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:58,732
I know, but, uh...

222
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:02,169
I really need to talk to you.

223
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,961

I don't know.

He's the bomb, but...

247
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:34,294
I don't know. Maybe
I'm doing something wrong.

248
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:35,929
The whole sex thing
is kind of a drag.

249
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:39,332
A drag? I thought you were
in a total state of bliss.

250
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:42,836
Well, it's novel.

251
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,005
But I think I like
third base better.

252
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,940
Well, I mean, sure,
third base is great.

253
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:48,141
I mean, really doing it

254
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:49,810
takes a while to get used to.

255
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:50,944
But then you'll love it.

256
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:52,379
Really?

257
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:53,981
You guys love it?

258
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:56,249
Yeah.

259
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:58,085
It's sex.

260
00:11:58,118 --> 00:11:59,452
Jennifer, darling.

261
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:02,823
I couldn't help but overhear.

262
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,424
The intercom was on.

263
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,492
Mother, privacy, please.

264
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,260
You're not respecting
my boundaries.

265
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:08,929
Oh, darling, I think
it's just adorable

266
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,831
that you're exploring
your sexuality.

267
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,233
Really, I just love it.

268
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,535
Could you not be
so fucking patronizing?

269
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,205
Well, there's nothing to be ashamed
of, Jennifer.

270
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,307
Plenty of women don't enjoy sex,

271
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:24,111
and I'll tell you why right now.

272
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:26,880
Because they're not climaxing.

273
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:30,517
They've never experienced
the deepest female pleasure.

274
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,886
We don't need your
insight, Dr. Ruth.

275
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,221
I had countless lovers

276
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,789
who thought that female orgasm

277
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:38,992
was some sort of Chinese
paper folding.

278
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:41,461
Ha ha ha ha ha!

279
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:45,298
I mean, utterly without a clue.

280
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:46,900
What do you mean?

281
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:47,968
Look, it's the '90s, okay?

282
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,037
There's an article in Cosmo,
like, every month

283
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,305
about female orgasm, so...

284
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,407
Cosmo.

285
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,476
How do you expect
to learn anything

286
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:00,914

with breast implants?

287
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:03,283
Okay, out.
Out, out, out, out.

288
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:04,451
Oh, oh, Jennifer...

289
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:05,452
You're such a freak.

290
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:06,586

Est-que vous avais jamais
voyager en France?

310
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:17,891
Listen, Jen, I think
your mom's right.

311
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:19,459
I'm not orgasming.

312
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,660
What? No.

313
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,031
How can you have sex
without orgasming?

314
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:26,967
I don't think this is
appropriate conversation.

315
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,470
Non, non, non! En français!

316
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:33,506
We must be with the French.

317
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:37,610
Je veux l'orgasme.

318
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:40,180
That means I want an orgasm.

319
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,648
No shit.

320
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:45,652
Oh, là là!
Qu'est-ce que c'est, ça?

321
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,955
Maintenant...

322
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:49,289
Stream.

323
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,658
Oui, Renée, je suis
allé en France.

324
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,994
Très bien.

325
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,495
Maintenant...

326
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:56,529
Nell?

327
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,031
Moi aussi.

328
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:59,566
J'ai visité la France,

329
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,334
et je l'ai beaucoup aimée.

330
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:02,635
Bon.

331
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,537
Jenny.

332
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,039
Oui.

333
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:07,474
Uh...

334
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:08,976
Oui.

335
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:11,211

336
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,646
Non.

337
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:18,986
Non.

338
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,521
Pas bien.

339
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:23,090
Pas bien.

340
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,495
I don't know why I do
so badly in this class.

341
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,430
I have a real connection
with the French.

342
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:31,999
I mean, come on.

343
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:34,101
All my favorite shirts
are from Agnes B.

344
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:38,738
How can you be sure you do?

345
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,708
Stream, we've been having sex
a lot longer than you have.

346
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:43,643
We've been doing it
since we were 15.

347
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,146
When you were going
on hayrides in Vermont,

348
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:48,048
we were busy getting laid.

349
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,050
You mean every time
you guys have sex,

350
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:54,421
you experience "increased
heat and tingliness

351
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,457
"that leads to a feeling
of inevitability,

352
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,359
"and then a dam-breaking burst

353
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:01,995
"of piercing pleasure
and muscle spasms,

354
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:06,066
followed by trembling
and diminishing shudders"?

355
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:08,101
That about sums it up.

356
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,136
More or less.

357
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,404
I guess it's just me, then.

358
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:12,572
Don't feel inadequate.

359
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,574
You just need to loosen up.

360
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:17,177
Right. Well, according
to the experts,

361
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:21,114
I should increase my
relationships for my sensuality,

362
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:22,649
develop my fantasy life,

363
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:25,452
and more fully communicate
my needs to my partner.

364
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,021
Don't be too bossy and make
your partner lose his erection.

365
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:30,357
Mmm.

366
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,659
Dick, I know I'm just
a shareholder now,

367
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:34,094
but I love this company,

368
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:36,129
and you're running it
into the ground.

369
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:38,298
You got to be kidding
if you think

370
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,801
people are gonna buy
avocado-flavored toothpaste.

371
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,737
No. Yeah. I know
we're all-natural,

372
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,339
but this is disgusting.

373
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:48,408
No, I'm not wigging out.

374
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:50,043
I'm trying
to communicate with you

375
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:51,811
from a very centered place,

376
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,082
and save us all
from financial ruin.

377
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,151
Oh, really?

378
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:00,253
Well, you can just kiss my ass

379
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:02,422
if that's what I get
for trying to help.

380
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,127
He hung up.

381
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,295
Can you believe that?

382
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:10,763
Well, you did tell him
to kiss your ass.

383
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:14,501
Yeah. As if no one ever
told him that before.

384
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,404
Well, you're the one who's so
committed to communication.

385
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:19,339
Why don't you try
to be more diplomatic?

386
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,308
We don't negotiate
with terrorists.

387
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:24,477
All right. I have rage.
Sorry. I have rage.

388
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:25,678
Mom, you seem stressed out.

389
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,480
Maybe we should take a vacation,

390
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:29,116
go to Vermont for the weekend.

391
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,318
I can't be in the same
state as your father.

392
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:36,156
I'm sorry. No. Vermont is
a nest of bad memories.

393
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:38,825
Look at you.
You look so pretty.

394
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,693
Are you going out with that boy

395
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,762
whose father made
all those Mafia movies?

396
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,364
Yeah, Chad.
Chad.

397
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,166
Who's your date with?

398
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:49,469
A most cultured
and sophisticated man.

399
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:52,839
A potter from South Africa.

400
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,780
For an amateur, your mother
has a very good eye.

401
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,482
She was immediately
drawn to my work.

402
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:06,153
Bartholomew's quite
a successful artist.

403
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:08,155
I saw his show at MOMA,

404
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:10,757
and I just immediately... I felt,

405
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,693
I don't know. You just
have so much to teach me.

406
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:14,527
Oh, thank you.

407
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,196
But you want to be
a photographer.

408
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,330
Well, of course, Stream.

409
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:19,232
That's what's
so fascinating about it.

410
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:21,134
Yes. Very few people
understand

411
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:22,735
how difficult it is

412
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,305
to express human suffering
in ceramics.

413
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,407
That is true.

414
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,608
Very, very true.

415
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,143
Really, that's so true.

416
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:31,411
Extremely true.

417
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,479
Absolutely.

418
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:33,546
Absolutely.

419
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:35,715
Really true.

420
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:37,884
Yeah.

421
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,822
So, honey, what do you and Chad
have planned for tonight?

422
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,191
I'm not sure.

423
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,425
We might be going for drinks

424
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,160
with his dad
and Barbra Streisand.

425
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:50,163
Barbra Streisand.
Ooh!

426
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:52,131
I wonder if she
might sing a song.

427
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,202
You never know.

The people who write the SATs

436
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,601
are not as smart as I am.

437
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:29,702
Correct.

438
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:30,870

Yes.

He's fucking worth it, though.

449
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,227
My brother's scores went

Why? You got a 1450.

453
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:03,270
Yeah. My dad wants me
to break 1500.

454
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:04,871
He's got this fantasy

455
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,506
that somehow
I'll get a scholarship

456
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,508

some magical percentile.

457
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,709

Sure.

You know...

473
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:44,877

474
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,913

484
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:10,303

00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:41,047
Mmm.

547
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,015
Of course, we're
still great friends.

548
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:46,052
That's good.
That's very mature. Mm.

549
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:47,787
Oh...

550
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,622
Ohh!

551
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:53,125
I'm sorry I took so long.

552
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,561
Oh, that's okay.

553
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:12,679
You know, I have
this friend Stream.

554
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:15,014
Oh, my heart goes out to her.

555
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:17,717
She's so sexually unfulfilled.

556
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:22,555
She just can't climax.
It's awful.

557
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:24,557
I do the best I can
to give her advice,

558
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:28,628
but... I don't know.

559
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:30,597
Sometimes I feel like...

560
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,198
some people
are innately sensual,

561
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:35,067
and some just aren't, you know?

562
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:36,936
Does your friend masturbate?

563
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:38,705
Masturbate?

564
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:41,107
Well, no. She's not
desperate or anything.

565
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,676
I mean, she does
have a boyfriend.

566
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:46,979
Each section is timed

567
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:48,314
at 30 minutes.

568
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:50,316
We will give you
a five-minute warning

569
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:52,351
before each section is finished.

570
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,655
Do not work on any section

571
00:25:55,688 --> 00:25:58,725
other than the one you are
supposed to be working on.

572
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:10,637
Remember to breathe.

573
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,271
Thanks.

574
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:13,906
You're welcome.

575
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,941
All right.

576
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:17,610
You may now open
your test booklets.

577
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:43,135
Time's up.

578
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:46,138
Place your answer sheets
inside your test booklets

579
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:48,307
and pass them
to the end of the table

580
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,942
for a proctor to collect.

581
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:51,343
Do not leave your seat

582
00:26:51,377 --> 00:26:54,747
until a proctor has collected
your test booklet.

583
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:13,800
I did not expect
Allen Ginsberg to show up

584
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,134
in Reading Comprehension.

585
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:17,670
It was my happiest moment.

586
00:27:17,704 --> 00:27:19,806
The universe is a new flower.

587
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:22,274
The secrets
of individual imagination

588
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:23,943
are not for sale.

589
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,311
I love that.

590
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:27,847
Me, too.

591
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,448
Hey.

592
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,918
Let's celebrate.

593
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,754
Yeah, let's go.

594
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:52,104
Oh, you know, I think

595
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:53,740
that the thousand bucks
for Afshin

596
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:54,774
really paid off.

597
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:57,443
I just kicked ass in there.

598
00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:59,411
What made you think you blew it?

599
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:01,781
I totally forgot
what "quiddity" meant.

600
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:04,116
I thought it was what
makes things the same,

601
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,318
not what makes a thing distinct.

602
00:28:07,754 --> 00:28:11,824
Well, I've got something
that will cheer you up.

603
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:14,994
I got this
from a friend of mine.

604
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,162
Who?

605
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,097
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

606
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,398
What is it?

607
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,834
Is it ecstasy?

608
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:23,002
Yeah.

609
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,804
We take it now,

610
00:28:24,837 --> 00:28:27,039
and we have a really
wild time later.

Oh...

623
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:57,236
We can't go home.

624
00:28:57,269 --> 00:29:02,508
My... My dad is... Is
throwing a party for my mom.

625
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:03,409
It's what he does

626
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:06,745
every time she catches him
cheating on her.

627
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,549
Oops!

628
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,218
Oh, Dad!

629
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:18,157
So, uh, just, uh, drive around,

630
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,392
and we'll have some privacy now.

631
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:21,527
Yes, sir.

632
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:24,296
Ro-o-oap!

633
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,069
Well...

634
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:34,573
uh... this seems, uh,
pretty comfy.

635
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:39,145
Yes. This seat is...
so soft.

636
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:43,950
Feels fantastic.

637
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:48,955
Mmm...

638
00:29:48,988 --> 00:29:49,956
Ohh...

639
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:52,091
Oh, listen.

640
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,927
That thing I wanted to tell you.

641
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:56,428
Oh, right. That thing.

642
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:59,932
I've never had an orgasm.

643
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:01,200
Ah!

644
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:09,041
I don't get it.
You're kidding, right?

645
00:30:09,075 --> 00:30:10,910
Nope.

646
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:12,912
Whoa!

647
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:17,016
Whoa.

648
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,951
That's an ego blow.

649
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:20,219
No.

650
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:22,321
No, no, it's not your fault.

651
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:23,890
My... M...

652
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,862
Well, of course
it's not my fault.

653
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:33,632
Still, though, I think, uh...

654
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,068
I think maybe I should
do something about it.

Oh...

669
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:57,089
How does it... feel?

670
00:30:57,123 --> 00:30:58,557
Mmm, good.

671
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,960
This is the best...

672
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:03,662
carpet I've ever felt.

673
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,232
My ass is in heaven.
Yeah.

674
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:09,101
Ah! Ah! Ahh!

675
00:31:09,135 --> 00:31:10,970
Ahhh!
Wait...

676
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:12,171
Don't stop!

677
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:18,610
What? I think I was getting
closer, but...

678
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:19,678
W-W-What are you talking about?

679
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,915
You totally came.

680
00:31:22,949 --> 00:31:24,050
I did?

681
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,985
Congratulations.
Details.

682
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:27,319
How was it different?

683
00:31:27,353 --> 00:31:30,156
Well, it was a totally
heightened sense

684
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:32,491
of female pleasure.
That's right. Exactly.

685
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:34,160
It's all about being relaxed.

686
00:31:34,193 --> 00:31:35,928
We were definitely relaxed.

687
00:31:35,962 --> 00:31:37,396
We did X.
Oh.

688
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:40,132
Yeah, well, drugs
always help, I guess.

689
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:46,572
I'm doing it.

690
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:48,540
I will allow my parents

691
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:50,009
to live vicariously through me.

692
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:51,610
I'm applying for early
admissions to Yale.

693
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:55,014
Ah.
Very nice, very nice.

694
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:56,648
Harvard. Early.

695
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:57,950
Ah.

696
00:31:57,984 --> 00:32:00,152
Me, too.
Early to Brown.

697
00:32:00,186 --> 00:32:01,253
Oh.

698
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:02,989
Is it against the rules

699
00:32:03,022 --> 00:32:04,523
to have my stepfather's
secretary

700
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:06,258
type up my application form?

701
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:07,593
Uh, Jennifer, I don't think

702
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:10,029
your grades or your
scores on your SATs,

703
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:12,331
which you chose not to retake,

704
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:14,000
will get you in early to Brown.

705
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:17,003
It's okay. My father bought
me a learning disability.

706
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:18,137
What the hell is that?

707
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,239
It's an official statement

708
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:23,009
from a highly regarded
education specialist

709
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:26,278
that says my low SAT scores
and my mediocre grades

710
00:32:26,312 --> 00:32:29,615
are in no way a reflection
of my intelligence.

711
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:31,650
I have Attention Deficit
Disorder.

712
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:34,653
Oh, so that's
what they call people

713
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:37,023
who get distracted at the
winter sale at Barney's

714
00:32:37,056 --> 00:32:38,590
on the day of a physics test.

715
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:41,360
I saved thousands at that sale.

716
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:43,996
And what about you, sir, hmm?

717
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,998
What name have you
put on your application?

718
00:32:46,032 --> 00:32:47,633
My name is Lipschitz.

719
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:49,601
Well, I appreciate
your integrity,

720
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:52,038
but don't you think
that's a bit rash,

721
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:54,140
considering the importance
of the situation?

722
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:57,743
Look, if I can't get
into Yale on my own merits,

723
00:32:57,776 --> 00:33:00,079
then I...

724
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:02,114
I don't want to go.

725
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:04,716
Oh, well, I hope you're
happy with Sarah Lawrence.

726
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:08,120
Yeah, I hear they have a great
finger-painting department.

727
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:10,056
I don't have
to remind you, I hope,

728
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:12,158
that your early applications
are due November 15,

729
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:15,027
which means those of you
who get them in early

730
00:33:15,061 --> 00:33:17,729
will have a month to brush up
on your weak areas.

731
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:19,431
Uh, Stream, what about, uh,

732
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:22,234
what about your extracurricular
activities, hmm?

733
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:26,638
Uh, well, um...

734
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,143
How you doing?
Can I get a hot soup?

735
00:33:32,078 --> 00:33:36,482
Hey. So why did you
change your name?

736
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,084
I have a prison record.

737
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:39,118
You do?

738
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:40,686
No. I'm kidding.

739
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,088
I made it up.

740
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:43,589
Oh.

741
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:45,524
Actually, it's my mom's name.

742
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:49,095
I didn't want to ride my dad's
luxury train the rest of my life.

743
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:50,062
Barely know the guy.

744
00:33:50,096 --> 00:33:51,697
Oh. I see.

745
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:56,068
I'll take a doughnut.
Do you want a doughnut?

746
00:33:56,102 --> 00:33:57,803
No, thanks.

747
00:33:57,836 --> 00:33:59,071
One doughnut.

748
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,609
Listen, uh...

749
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:07,079
do you want to go hear
some music sometime?

750
00:34:07,113 --> 00:34:10,182
Uh, I don't think I should.

751
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:11,417
I'm kind of seeing Chad.

752
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:14,553
Why?

753
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:15,721
What?

754
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:18,090
Why would you want
to go out with that guy?

755
00:34:18,124 --> 00:34:20,292
Well... I like him.

756
00:34:20,326 --> 00:34:22,094
Do you?

757
00:34:22,128 --> 00:34:23,129
Yeah.

758
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:24,130
Really?

759
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:25,331
I do.

760
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,400
But maybe all three of us

761
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:30,769
could go hear
some music sometime.

762
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,608
Only if you promise he won't
name-drop once all night.

763
00:34:36,642 --> 00:34:38,277
I can't promise that.

764
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,545
See?

765
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:47,753
One coffee, black.

766
00:34:56,895 --> 00:34:58,364
Here you go.

767
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,634
Where's your drink?

768
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:04,903
I don't like to waste
calories on beverages,

769
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,772
but I'll have a sip of yours.

770
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:11,510
It is so great
to finally be orgasmic.

771
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:13,845
Does it show?

772
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:16,182
Well, where exactly
should I be looking?

773
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:18,150
At my face, bitch.

774
00:35:18,184 --> 00:35:19,751
Ooh, "bitch."

775
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:21,587
So urbane.

776
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,889
Well, you certainly
look self-satisfied,

777
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:26,158
if that's what you mean.

778
00:35:26,192 --> 00:35:28,660
So when you were trying
to have an orgasm,

779
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:30,629
did you ever masturbate?

780
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:33,199
Masturbate?
Not really.

781
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:34,933
I didn't think so.

782
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:35,967
I mean, it's so weird.

783
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:39,638
Every time I try, I just
get bored and fall asleep.

784
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:42,241
Yeah.
It's just not my style.

785
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:44,910
I think it's mostly for
people who never get out.

786
00:35:46,278 --> 00:35:48,180
Mmm.

787
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:50,216
Life is so unfair.

788
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:58,190
Oh, how can you stand

789
00:35:58,224 --> 00:36:00,759
to be in the same Jacuzzi
as my cellulite?

790
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:03,161
You are so nuts.

791
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:11,270
Hello.

792
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:12,738
Who is it?

793
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:15,741
Yes, this is she.

794
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:18,176
Look, I'm not interested.

795
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:23,715
I just went
on a cruise last summer.

796
00:36:26,252 --> 00:36:27,786
Mine went to Europe.

797
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:32,424
No, I'm not interested.

798
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:38,364
I'm in the middle of a Jacuzzi.

799
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:41,700
I am not interested.

800
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:44,970
I am gonna hang up on you.

801
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:46,738
I'm not interested.

802
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:51,343
Do you get paid
to be this obnoxious?

803
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:34,620
Oh, my God.

804
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:38,023
What the hell happened to you?

805
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:40,492
Guess what.

806
00:37:40,526 --> 00:37:43,329
I was wrong.

807
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:00,679
Hi, baby.

808
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:02,047
Look, Chad, did you really think

809
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,682
I had an orgasm in your limo,

810
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:05,016
or were you just ready to come?

811
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:08,053
What the fuck kind of question is that?
Well, I didn't, and I think

812
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:10,422
it's very manipulative
of you to tell me I did.

813
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:12,791
Yeah? Well, fuck you.

814
00:38:20,566 --> 00:38:21,767
Come on, Nell.

815
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,435
Don't you think
it's a little weird

816
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:24,870
that Stream needed aquatherapy

817
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:26,104
to have her breakthrough?

818
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,440
I mean, I go off like a rocket

819
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:30,409
the second Louie caresses me.

820
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:44,956
Ahem.

821
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,530
Excuse me.

822
00:39:36,942 --> 00:39:38,510
Oh!

823
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:41,480
Listen, Jen,

824
00:39:41,513 --> 00:39:44,750
I think maybe we should
stop seeing each other.

825
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:46,985
What? Why?

826
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:48,720
We're not connecting in bed.

827
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:50,656
It's like...
You know what I mean?

828
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:53,459
Our sex life's empty.

829
00:39:53,492 --> 00:39:54,793
Empty?

830
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:58,630
So then I told him it was over.

831
00:39:58,664 --> 00:40:00,832
I felt stifled.

832
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:02,934
Watch it!

833
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:05,537
Hey!

834
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:09,007
Anyway, so we were
just sitting there, and...

835
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,743
Stream, are you
even listening to me?

836
00:40:11,777 --> 00:40:15,213
Yeah. I'm stunned.
I thought you were in love with Louie.

837
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,548
Well, I wasn't.

838
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:17,883
Could you please stop staring

839
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,184
at Mr. Fashion
Nightmare over there?

840
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:20,786
I think he's funny.

841
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:21,987
I think he smells.

842
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,221
I've got a confession to make.

843
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,222
What?

844
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:32,464
Okay, ladies, come on,
chop-chop.

845
00:40:32,498 --> 00:40:33,732
Move it.

846
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,801
Sitting on your rumps
and yapping

847
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:37,536
ain't playing volleyball.

848
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:40,038
Urinary tract infections,
Mr. Neipris.

849
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:42,440
Urinary tract infection?

850
00:40:44,743 --> 00:40:46,845
Sorry.

851
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:49,581
So what's the confession?

852
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:51,950
I got to face reality.
I don't like sex, either.

853
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:56,522
What? Oh, God, don't tell me
you're not climaxing, too.

854
00:40:56,555 --> 00:40:58,524
It's just the sad truth.

855
00:40:58,557 --> 00:41:00,759
Wow, Jen. You're
the only one of us

856
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,828
who's gotten off with a guy.

857
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:05,497
Well...

858
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:08,500
I've been having doubts, too.

859
00:41:08,534 --> 00:41:09,935
I mean, to be honest,

860
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:12,070
sex with Louie
was kind of a drag.

861
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:15,006
Now that I think about it,

862
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,742
I think I spent most of coitus

863
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:18,176
figuring out what color I wanted

864
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,245
for my next manicure.

865
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:21,246
Oh, my God.

866
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:22,681
Prozac?

867
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:25,951
Wait.

868
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,887
If none of us has ever
had it with a guy,

869
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,689
then who has?

870
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,995
Well, those losers sure haven't.

871
00:41:38,597 --> 00:41:40,298
♪ It's time to go

872
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,300
♪ It's time to blast off

873
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,670
♪ It's time to go, go, go ♪

874
00:41:44,703 --> 00:41:46,304
♪ It's time to blast off

875
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,739
♪ It's time to go

876
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:49,541
♪ It's time to blast off

877
00:41:49,575 --> 00:41:50,776
Not that I'm impressed,

878
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:52,711
but Keanu Reeves just
walked through the door.

879
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:53,712
Where?

880
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:54,946
By the bar.

881
00:41:56,782 --> 00:41:58,016
Did we order that?

882
00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:01,853
It's a two-bottle minimum
at each table.

883
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:03,555
$500?

884
00:42:03,589 --> 00:42:05,023
Just put it on your dad's card.

885
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:06,558
It's only 200 each.

886
00:42:06,592 --> 00:42:09,661
200... I really shouldn't.

887
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:12,263
Stream, you have
to live in the now.

888
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:13,932
We're here tonight
to find butter boys,

889
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:15,734
and the best butter boys
come here.

890
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:18,103
We have to upgrade
the level of sophistication

891
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:19,337
of the guys we're dealing with

892
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,607
if we want to be
sexually fulfilled.

893
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,142
We're wasting valuable energy
with these high school kids.

894
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:32,584
How come no buttery boys

895
00:42:32,618 --> 00:42:34,185
are stopping by to visit us?

896
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,788
I know, and we look so hot.

897
00:42:36,822 --> 00:42:38,857
Hey, go out there
and get us some.

898
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,125
Why me?

899
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:41,627
You're the skinniest.

900
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,094
You're the richest.

901
00:42:44,763 --> 00:42:46,131
Oh, my God.

902
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:48,133
Keanu's friend's
coming over here.

903
00:42:49,735 --> 00:42:51,737
Excuse me.
Do you model?

904
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,338
Well, actually, yes.

905
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:55,173
I have done some catalog work.

906
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:56,842
Swimsuits, mostly.

907
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:58,343
Actually, I was talking to you.

908
00:42:58,376 --> 00:43:01,680
Call me.

909
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:02,914
What is this, a joke?

910
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:10,121
Elitist Models?
Wow.

911
00:43:10,155 --> 00:43:12,691
Probably a fake.

912
00:43:12,724 --> 00:43:14,159
Thanks.
Come back soon.

913
00:43:18,697 --> 00:43:20,732
This is the best kind.

914
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:24,736
Actually,
I would have to disagree.

915
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:26,404
Macouns are the best.

916
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,674
Are they?

917
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:31,309
I like a little tartness
to my apple,

918
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:33,144
just like the next guy...

919
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:35,280
Not quite to the degree
of Granny Smith,

920
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:38,850
but something more subtle,
like Cortland or Empire.

921
00:43:38,884 --> 00:43:41,720
Empire?
What about Fuji?

922
00:43:41,753 --> 00:43:43,254
Love Fuji.

923
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:44,656
Hard to find, though.

924
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:46,357
Check this out.

925
00:43:46,391 --> 00:43:49,627
Tell me this isn't the best
apple you've had all fall.

926
00:43:53,064 --> 00:43:54,165
Delicious.

927
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:56,301
But try the Macoun.

928
00:43:58,704 --> 00:43:59,671
Tame.

929
00:43:59,705 --> 00:44:01,372
Tame?

930
00:44:01,406 --> 00:44:03,041
Okay. It's...

931
00:44:03,074 --> 00:44:05,777
it's playful...

932
00:44:05,811 --> 00:44:06,912
zesty.

933
00:44:06,945 --> 00:44:09,915
See? You know a lot about
apples for a city boy.

934
00:44:09,948 --> 00:44:11,717
Well, I, uh...

935
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,719
I took Outward Bound...

936
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:16,354
twice.

937
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:17,723
Impressive.

938
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:18,790
Thanks.

939
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:20,959
Come on.

940
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:21,993
Sorry.

941
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,702
You ever go apple picking?

942
00:44:30,736 --> 00:44:32,738
You mean, uh, outside
of the farmer's market?

943
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:34,806
Yeah. It's fun.

944
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,807
I missed it this year.

945
00:44:35,841 --> 00:44:39,711
Well, there are still apples
on the trees, right?

946
00:44:39,745 --> 00:44:41,179
Let's go.

947
00:44:41,212 --> 00:44:42,447
What, you mean right now?

948
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,183
Yeah.
You and me, right now.

949
00:44:45,216 --> 00:44:46,752
Let's get on a train.

950
00:44:48,754 --> 00:44:50,956
Oh. Well...

951
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:53,925
What? You still got that
A-list boyfriend of yours?

952
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:55,426
No, I don't.

953
00:44:56,795 --> 00:44:58,797
But I'm supposed
to meet my friends

954
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:00,098
in a half an hour.

955
00:45:00,131 --> 00:45:01,332
They're waiting for me.

956
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:04,435
Oh, I forgot.

957
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:06,838
You do everything
by committee, right?

958
00:45:10,475 --> 00:45:12,944
Then I'm gonna go
check out the squash.

959
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:20,318
As I'm sure you're aware,

960
00:45:20,351 --> 00:45:22,821
this is the last week
before the holidays,

961
00:45:22,854 --> 00:45:26,992
and we still haven't written
anything on Othello.

962
00:45:27,025 --> 00:45:29,761
So I'm assigning an essay

963
00:45:29,795 --> 00:45:32,263
to be handed in on Friday.

964
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:35,967
In five to ten pages,

965
00:45:36,001 --> 00:45:40,138
present a careful exegesis
of the structure of the play

966
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:44,475
with an emphasis
on the dramatic tensions

967
00:45:44,509 --> 00:45:46,912
that lead to the climax.

968
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,319
Another essay before Friday?

969
00:45:54,352 --> 00:45:55,854
Doesn't she realize

970
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:58,489
we've got our own tensions
leading to climax?

971
00:45:58,523 --> 00:45:59,524
Channel it.

972
00:45:59,557 --> 00:46:00,892
All right.

973
00:46:00,926 --> 00:46:02,794
Now you can use
the rest of the class

974
00:46:02,828 --> 00:46:04,229
to prepare your positions.

975
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:07,833
What's this?

976
00:46:07,866 --> 00:46:09,534
Random midmorning vanity?

977
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:11,569
I have an appointment.

978
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:14,105
That agent's
sending me on a go-see.

979
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:15,106
Agent?

980
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,407
A go-see?

981
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:17,843
You're kidding, right?

982
00:46:17,876 --> 00:46:19,845
What, so now you're
dying to be a model?

983
00:46:19,878 --> 00:46:21,479
I know it's weird.

984
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:24,015
It's just my parents
got all excited about it,

985
00:46:24,049 --> 00:46:27,285
so whatever.

986
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:29,054
Studio.

987
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:31,089
Who's calling?

988
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:33,925
Let me check.

989
00:46:39,998 --> 00:46:41,833
Sorry, sorry, baby dolls.

990
00:46:41,867 --> 00:46:42,600
There's no time left.

991
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,870
I can only see one more.

992
00:46:44,903 --> 00:46:47,005
Um... you.

993
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:49,807
Uh...

994
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,111
Can I have him call you back?

995
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:57,615
Look back and tell me if my
ass looks fat in this saddle.

996
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,050
I refuse to be your enabler.

997
00:46:59,084 --> 00:47:00,485
Just look back and tell me

998
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:03,288
if my ass looks fat
in this saddle.

999
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:05,523
Whoa.

1000
00:47:09,027 --> 00:47:10,828
Jennifer Simon.

1001
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:12,898
What?

1002
00:47:12,931 --> 00:47:14,165
Is it Nell?

1003
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:15,566
You bitch.

1004
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,636
Oh, my God.
You are such a bitch.

1005
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,605
It's unbelievable.

1006
00:47:20,638 --> 00:47:22,373
Okay, bye.

1007
00:47:22,407 --> 00:47:24,042
She got a modeling job?

1008
00:47:24,075 --> 00:47:26,978
She's gonna be
on the cover of YM.

1009
00:47:27,012 --> 00:47:28,179
That bitch.

1010
00:47:28,213 --> 00:47:29,414
She's not even that pretty.

1011
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:30,481
Giddyup.

1012
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,920
Well, that's fine.
She'll never have an orgasm

1013
00:47:34,953 --> 00:47:36,321
with any of those male models.

1014
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:37,956
They're way too self-involved.

1015
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:39,124
Meow.

1016
00:47:39,157 --> 00:47:41,059
Well, it's not my fault
if I'm bitter.

1017
00:47:41,092 --> 00:47:42,393
My mother's in rehab.

1018
00:47:42,427 --> 00:47:45,096
Which reminds me,
her new sponsor Doug is so sexy.

1019
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:46,965
Ethically,
he can't go out with me,

1020
00:47:46,998 --> 00:47:47,966
but he's perfect for you.

1021
00:47:47,999 --> 00:47:49,134
Really? Why?

1022
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:51,136
He's older. He's single.

1023
00:47:51,169 --> 00:47:53,538
And I'm sure... Whoa.

1024
00:47:53,571 --> 00:47:55,473
I'm sure he has
a lot of knowledge

1025
00:47:55,506 --> 00:47:56,674
about female pleasure.

1026
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,244
Great. How old is he?

1027
00:47:59,277 --> 00:48:01,546
40-ish, but very well-preserved.

1028
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:04,482
Trust me,
he's really attractive.

1029
00:48:04,515 --> 00:48:05,483
Giddyup.

1030
00:48:05,516 --> 00:48:06,651
Okay.

1031
00:48:07,685 --> 00:48:11,256
Look, Dad, I'm really sorry

1032
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:13,458
I didn't break 1500 on my SATs,

1033
00:48:13,491 --> 00:48:17,662
but I'm not sure getting a
scholarship was a realistic goal.

1034
00:48:17,695 --> 00:48:18,596
I mean, I'll be lucky

1035
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:21,099
if I even get into
one of those schools.

1036
00:48:21,132 --> 00:48:22,433
What are you talking about?

1037
00:48:22,467 --> 00:48:23,701
You're a genius.

1038
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,036
I'm not.

1039
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:26,972
I'm just a good student

1040
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:28,306
at a good high school.

1041
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:31,509
I mean, I'm probably not
even eligible to get in.

1042
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:33,144
They look at what
your parents make...

1043
00:48:33,178 --> 00:48:34,412
Let 'em look, okay?

1044
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:35,680
After what I give your
mother every month,

1045
00:48:35,713 --> 00:48:37,682
I'm practically bankrupt.

1046
00:48:37,715 --> 00:48:38,950
Hi, everybody.

1047
00:48:38,984 --> 00:48:41,052
Hi, baby.
Oh, baby.

1048
00:48:41,086 --> 00:48:43,288
I thought it was
just gonna be us.

1049
00:48:45,056 --> 00:48:47,692
Oh. Do you mind if I just
put this on the floor?

1050
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:49,060
That's Stream's
Christmas present.

1051
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:50,228
Pretty good, huh?

1052
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:51,662
Oh, yeah, I love it.

1053
00:48:51,696 --> 00:48:55,000
So, Stream, have you
seen the new box?

1054
00:48:55,033 --> 00:48:56,501
Huh? What do you think,
Stream?

1055
00:48:56,534 --> 00:48:59,437
A lot hipper than that stupid
old shiny toothed squirrel.

1056
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:02,473
Well, uh, it's, uh, different.

1057
00:49:02,507 --> 00:49:05,043
Don't be shy.
I want your expertise.

1058
00:49:05,076 --> 00:49:07,045
We're targeting
a younger market.

1059
00:49:07,078 --> 00:49:08,713
Well, um...

1060
00:49:08,746 --> 00:49:10,115
to be honest, Dad,

1061
00:49:10,148 --> 00:49:12,984
I think it's
kind of... tacky.

1062
00:49:13,018 --> 00:49:13,884
Tacky?

1063
00:49:13,918 --> 00:49:16,988
Uh, she... she's a kid.
What does she know?

1064
00:49:17,022 --> 00:49:18,256
I, uh...

1065
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:21,526
Why, I appreciate
your opinion, Stream. I do.

1066
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:24,062
It's just... Well, you know,
I'm a little sensitive

1067
00:49:24,095 --> 00:49:25,196
because it's my design.

1068
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:27,765
And it's beautiful.
It's so creative.

1069
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,701
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.
Nobody told me.

1070
00:49:30,735 --> 00:49:31,769
No, it's okay.

1071
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,672
It's really okay.

1072
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:37,775
It's just...

1073
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:42,180
It's just... Oh, it really
hurt my feelings!

1074
00:49:42,213 --> 00:49:45,616
Oh, who am I kidding?
What do I know about design?

1075
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,385
Oh, everybody
misses that squirrel!

1076
00:49:47,418 --> 00:49:50,255
Not me. I hate
that fucking squirrel.

1077
00:49:50,288 --> 00:49:52,023
Sweetheart, sweetheart.

1078
00:49:52,057 --> 00:49:54,459
Count me out
of the older men idea.

1079
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:56,627
Girls who go out
with older men are freaks.

1080
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:57,462
No, they're not.

1081
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:58,696
They're sophisticated.

1082
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:01,632
Well, this chick Mimi has
obvious emotional problems,

1083
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:04,269
and the whole thing made
my dad look like a letch.

1084
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:06,404
Did you say Daddy's a letch?

1085
00:50:06,437 --> 00:50:08,806
Hold on.
Not really. Sort of.

1086
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,675
Boy, I think so, too.

1087
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:13,044
Where'd you get this?
It's so cute.

1088
00:50:13,078 --> 00:50:14,045
Stream...

1089
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,047
Anyway, I just can't cope

1090
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:17,782
with the whole
Doug the Sponsor strategy.

1091
00:50:17,815 --> 00:50:19,050
It's just too gross.

1092
00:50:19,084 --> 00:50:22,120
So how bald is your father?

1093
00:50:23,388 --> 00:50:24,655
On a scale of 1 to 10?

1094
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:26,791
Did he say anything about me?

1095
00:50:26,824 --> 00:50:28,626
Is your mom yakking
about your dad again?

1096
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:29,794
Okay, don't tell me.

1097
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:30,795
I don't want to put you
in the middle.

1098
00:50:30,828 --> 00:50:32,297
Tell your mother
to get of there.

1099
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:33,631
I hope you told him

1100
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:35,433
I'm seeing
a South African potter.

1101
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:37,402
Mom, please, I'm on the phone.

1102
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:39,170
You're always on the phone.

1103
00:50:39,204 --> 00:50:42,073
I never get to see you anymore.

1104
00:50:42,107 --> 00:50:43,774
What about our relationship?

1105
00:50:43,808 --> 00:50:44,842
My mother's driving me crazy.

1106
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,277
So what... What...

1107
00:50:46,311 --> 00:50:48,279
What did your father
give you for Christmas?

1108
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:52,783
Well, no kidding!

1109
00:50:52,817 --> 00:50:54,552
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1110
00:50:54,585 --> 00:50:58,223
How old does he think
you are? 10?

1111
00:51:00,858 --> 00:51:02,327
Anyway, go ahead.

1112
00:51:10,435 --> 00:51:13,771
It's 11:30. Clearly,
we've made a tactical error.

1113
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:16,141
I mean, none of the cool
people have arrived.

1114
00:51:16,174 --> 00:51:17,875
If I have to face the new year

1115
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,310
with no prospects for a climax,

1116
00:51:19,344 --> 00:51:21,246
I'm gonna go post
naked pictures of myself

1117
00:51:21,279 --> 00:51:22,880
on the damn Internet.

1118
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,850
Nell, didn't any of your
new male model friends

1119
00:51:25,883 --> 00:51:28,153
invite you
to a New Year's Eve party?

1120
00:51:28,186 --> 00:51:30,255
What new male model friends?

1121
00:51:30,288 --> 00:51:31,422
Yeah, Nell.

1122
00:51:31,456 --> 00:51:32,857
Where are Kate and Naomi going?

1123
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:35,226
Look, let's just go
to Betsy Bradley's.

1124
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,395
I mean, at least her
stepfather owns the Knicks.

1125
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,264
I'm gonna go get a drink.

1126
00:51:43,668 --> 00:51:45,236
A low-tech party, huh?

1127
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:47,838
Yeah.
How'd you end up here?

1128
00:51:47,872 --> 00:51:50,508
Uh, the guy's the bass
player in my band.

1129
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:51,609
What band?

1130
00:51:51,642 --> 00:51:53,110
Oedipus Wreck.

1131
00:51:56,647 --> 00:51:58,883
Oh, I guess I got to go.

1132
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:01,352
Why don't you stick around?

1133
00:52:01,386 --> 00:52:04,189
Rebel against
the committee for once.

1134
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:05,290
They're not a committee.

1135
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:07,158
They don't tell me what to do.

1136
00:52:07,192 --> 00:52:08,459
They're my friends.

1137
00:52:08,493 --> 00:52:10,261
Then let's go for a walk.

1138
00:52:10,295 --> 00:52:11,396
How do you know I want to?

1139
00:52:11,429 --> 00:52:13,631
Well, I'm asking.

1140
00:52:13,664 --> 00:52:14,665
Do you?

1141
00:52:15,733 --> 00:52:17,768
Fine.

1142
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:19,136
Fine.

1143
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,475
What the hell's she doing?

1144
00:52:24,509 --> 00:52:25,543
What?

1145
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:27,178
Where are you going?

1146
00:52:27,212 --> 00:52:28,679
Great.

1147
00:52:35,453 --> 00:52:39,257
So... what's
your first choice?

1148
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:41,959
Wouldn't it be great for once

1149
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,828
to spend an evening with someone

1150
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:46,831
and not talk about college?

1151
00:52:46,864 --> 00:52:48,433
Is that possible?

1152
00:52:48,466 --> 00:52:49,867
I mean, they make it seem

1153
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,302
like the college you get into

1154
00:52:51,336 --> 00:52:53,471
determines the quality
of the rest of your life.

1155
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:55,373
Well, it sort of does,
doesn't it?

1156
00:52:55,406 --> 00:52:57,575
No, not unless you see your life

1157
00:52:57,608 --> 00:52:59,410
like a line on a grid.

1158
00:52:59,444 --> 00:53:01,746
You can't plan out
the future anyway.

1159
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:06,584
The future's a...
figment of your imagination.

1160
00:53:06,617 --> 00:53:09,220
Whatever happened to chaos?

1161
00:53:10,488 --> 00:53:13,758
Rolling in the mud,
for fuck's sake.

1162
00:53:15,726 --> 00:53:17,395
I'd like to roll in the mud.

1163
00:53:18,729 --> 00:53:21,966
Now, that is a fine idea.

1164
00:53:21,999 --> 00:53:23,301
Come on.

1165
00:53:23,334 --> 00:53:25,870
W-What are you doing?

1166
00:53:25,903 --> 00:53:28,406
Wait. Where are you going?

1167
00:53:28,439 --> 00:53:31,309
Raagh! Come on!

1168
00:53:31,342 --> 00:53:32,977
But what about my outfit?

1169
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:35,413
Your outfit is just an illusion.

1170
00:53:35,446 --> 00:53:37,948
You see, the mud, that's real.

1171
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:43,020
Aah!

1172
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,489
Oh, God.

1173
00:53:44,522 --> 00:53:46,424
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1174
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:50,795
Ha ha ha! Oh, God!

1175
00:53:50,828 --> 00:53:52,229
Ha ha ha ha!

1176
00:54:01,706 --> 00:54:03,708
Do you want to kiss me?

1177
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,376
Do you want to kiss me?

1178
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:08,279
I don't know. I thought
you might want to kiss me.

1179
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:13,918
Well, that wasn't what I was
thinking about right then.

1180
00:54:16,053 --> 00:54:17,422
Why the hell not?

1181
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:20,825
It's the new year.

1182
00:54:20,858 --> 00:54:23,694
Don't you want to kiss
somebody for good luck?

1183
00:54:23,728 --> 00:54:26,831
I don't believe
in the traditional shit.

1184
00:54:26,864 --> 00:54:29,300
Do you want to always do
what everyone else does?

1185
00:54:29,334 --> 00:54:32,637
No. I don't,
as a matter of fact.

1186
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:35,973
I went on this walk
with you, didn't I?

1187
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:38,376
I mean, I have a lot
going on inside me

1188
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:39,710
that you don't know about.

1189
00:54:39,744 --> 00:54:42,313
Just because I happen to have
two very close friends

1190
00:54:42,347 --> 00:54:44,949
doesn't mean
I can't think for myself.

1191
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:53,624
Ohh...

1192
00:55:01,432 --> 00:55:02,933
Well, babe, that's what you get

1193
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:04,335
for ditching your girlfriends

1194
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:06,036
to go roll around in the mud

1195
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:07,572
with some self-hating blueblood.

1196
00:55:09,507 --> 00:55:11,108
I guess you're right.

1197
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,444
He wouldn't even come on to me.

1198
00:55:13,478 --> 00:55:15,580
That guy's a waste of your time.

1199
00:55:21,118 --> 00:55:22,987
Stream!

1200
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,122
Guess what, guess what,
guess what, guess what!

1201
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,792
Harvard! Ha ha ha ha!

1202
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:30,094
What does it say?
What does it say?

1203
00:55:30,127 --> 00:55:31,962
Yes?

1204
00:55:49,747 --> 00:55:51,616
It's only a deferral.

1205
00:55:51,649 --> 00:55:54,084
I've spoken with the people
at admissions at Harvard,

1206
00:55:54,118 --> 00:55:55,953
and they assure me
there's a chance

1207
00:55:55,986 --> 00:55:57,154
she'll be accepted in April,

1208
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,490
so she's still in the running.

1209
00:55:59,524 --> 00:56:01,158
But you saw her application.

1210
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,828
Wasn't it really special?

1211
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:05,663
Yes, but now she has
an opportunity

1212
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:07,565
to try other schools.

1213
00:56:07,598 --> 00:56:10,635
Is Stream terribly disappointed?

1214
00:56:11,669 --> 00:56:13,404
Well, she claims to be fine,

1215
00:56:13,438 --> 00:56:15,005
but, you know,

1216
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:17,942
how could she not feel
like a terrible failure?

1217
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:19,510
Not that I think that.

1218
00:56:19,544 --> 00:56:21,011
Well, of course not.

1219
00:56:21,045 --> 00:56:22,447
But, you know, it wouldn't hurt

1220
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,881
to have a talk with her

1221
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:25,783
just to make sure
that she realizes

1222
00:56:25,816 --> 00:56:27,852
you're all right with this.

1223
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:38,028
Mom, don't be so bummed out.

1224
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:40,030
Even if I don't get in anywhere,

1225
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:42,667
it doesn't determine the
quality of the rest of my life.

1226
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:43,901
Oh, I know.

1227
00:56:43,934 --> 00:56:45,570
It's just that you're
so much better

1228
00:56:45,603 --> 00:56:47,171
than all those other kids.

1229
00:56:47,204 --> 00:56:49,974
I don't see how Nell
got in early

1230
00:56:50,007 --> 00:56:51,041
when you didn't.

1231
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:53,511
Of course, I don't think
you should be competitive.

1232
00:56:53,544 --> 00:56:55,480
Well, Jenny didn't
get in early, either.

1233
00:56:55,513 --> 00:56:56,781
Well, Jenny's father can always

1234
00:56:56,814 --> 00:56:58,215
donate a library to Brown,

1235
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,485
and trust me, she'll get in,

1236
00:57:00,518 --> 00:57:03,220
whereas your father...
We'll be lucky

1237
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:06,691
if he buys you some sweaters
from L.L. Bean.

1238
00:57:06,724 --> 00:57:10,461
Maybe... Maybe I just
wasn't focused enough.

1239
00:57:10,495 --> 00:57:12,162
Maybe I... Whew...

1240
00:57:12,196 --> 00:57:15,199
Maybe I should have got you
more help, more support.

1241
00:57:15,232 --> 00:57:18,168
Maybe I should have done
your homework for you. I...

1242
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:22,039
But you know?

1243
00:57:22,072 --> 00:57:25,175
I'm really fine
about the whole thing.

1244
00:57:25,209 --> 00:57:27,512
And I... I feel totally confident

1245
00:57:27,545 --> 00:57:29,914
about the way
I brought you up. I do.

1246
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,682
It's no accident

1247
00:57:31,716 --> 00:57:34,251
that I sent you to a
Montessori kindergarten.

1248
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,186
You're a very bright young girl

1249
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:39,156
with a strong sense
of independence.

1250
00:57:47,231 --> 00:57:48,465
Condoms?

1251
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,604
Oh, my God.

1252
00:57:54,939 --> 00:57:57,508
I need to sit down.

1253
00:57:57,542 --> 00:58:00,978
Oh...
I'm... I'm struggling.

1254
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:03,047
Believe me, I'm struggling.

1255
00:58:06,016 --> 00:58:08,252
I hate sounding
like a conservative,

1256
00:58:08,285 --> 00:58:11,589
but I think it might be...

1257
00:58:11,622 --> 00:58:14,224
normal for... for...
For a loving parent

1258
00:58:14,258 --> 00:58:16,861
to have this reaction.

1259
00:58:18,796 --> 00:58:21,799
You're too young!
You're just a kid!

1260
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:23,167
I'm sorry,

1261
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,303
but I feel... I feel
100% judgmental.

1262
00:58:29,306 --> 00:58:31,609
Ow.

1263
00:58:39,316 --> 00:58:40,517
You're right.

1264
00:58:42,219 --> 00:58:46,190
I hate myself
for sounding judgmental.

1265
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:48,559
I guess I just have
to accept the fact

1266
00:58:48,593 --> 00:58:50,327
that you're...
almost an adult,

1267
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,898
and y-you have to take
responsibility

1268
00:58:53,931 --> 00:58:56,166
for your own decisions.

1269
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:59,336
So why are you here?

1270
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,639
My mother flipped her lid

1271
00:59:01,672 --> 00:59:03,674
when she found some condoms.

1272
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:06,577
I'm investigating sex.
Isn't that normal?

1273
00:59:07,344 --> 00:59:10,715
Who can say what's normal?

1274
00:59:10,748 --> 00:59:13,651
I mean, 70% of American
teenagers do it.

1275
00:59:13,684 --> 00:59:15,686
What's wrong with girls
wanting to have sex

1276
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,354
as much as guys do?

1277
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:20,057
I mean, I'm not...
obsessed with sex.

1278
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:22,126
Well, that's good.

1279
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:23,661
But...

1280
00:59:23,694 --> 00:59:26,797

1281

1282
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,869

1283
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:35,806
How do you think it happens?

1284
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,142
It seems like you...

1285
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:39,677

1286
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:41,679
Is the guy supposed to...

1287
00:59:41,712 --> 00:59:43,247
You tell him your needs,

1288
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,882
and he does stuff to you.

1289
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:47,652
Is it, uh, possible

1290
00:59:47,685 --> 00:59:53,390
that Stream is being
a little bit passive?

1291
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:56,593

01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:15,759
Fuck you.

1445
01:08:15,792 --> 01:08:19,263
Oh, I'd love to, but then
who'd take the photos?

1446
01:08:19,296 --> 01:08:21,131
What's that about?

1447
01:08:21,165 --> 01:08:22,866
Of course, I do have a tripod.

1448
01:08:35,912 --> 01:08:37,181
Hello.

1449
01:08:37,214 --> 01:08:39,349
It's for me.

1450
01:08:39,383 --> 01:08:40,850
What?

1451
01:08:40,884 --> 01:08:42,519
What credit card?

1452
01:08:42,552 --> 01:08:45,222
Dad, it... It was an emergency.

1453
01:08:45,255 --> 01:08:46,690
What's going on?
What's he talking about?

1454
01:08:46,723 --> 01:08:48,492
I thought you weren't
talking to me.

1455
01:08:48,525 --> 01:08:49,926
All right.
I'll rip it up.

1456
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:52,162
Dad, I said I would
rip it up, okay?

1457
01:08:52,196 --> 01:08:53,363
Now?

1458
01:08:53,397 --> 01:08:55,499
Oh, come on.

1459
01:08:55,532 --> 01:08:56,933
All right, fine.

1460
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:59,236
Is he abusing you emotionally?

1461
01:09:00,604 --> 01:09:03,173
Look, I'm destroying it, okay?

1462
01:09:03,207 --> 01:09:06,510
Look, Dad, I am
destroying the card, okay?

1463
01:09:06,543 --> 01:09:10,180
Do you hear that?
It's totally dead.

1464
01:09:10,214 --> 01:09:13,917
What? What do you mean
you can't pay for college?

1465
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:15,919
No, I can't get a scholarship!

1466
01:09:15,952 --> 01:09:18,522
Why are you torturing her?

1467
01:09:18,555 --> 01:09:21,891
If you can spend thousands
on that new bimbo of yours,

1468
01:09:21,925 --> 01:09:24,561
then you can cough it up
for your daughter's education.

1469
01:09:24,594 --> 01:09:25,962
Mom, please don't fight.

1470
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,931
You need to get
a hold of yourself, Dick.

1471
01:09:27,964 --> 01:09:30,534
You want her to have
to take out a loan

1472
01:09:30,567 --> 01:09:32,936
and be in debt for
the rest of her life,

1473
01:09:32,969 --> 01:09:34,904
just so you can buy
a new Range Rover?

1474
01:09:34,938 --> 01:09:35,905

Nell, stick your finger
down your throat.

1494
01:10:55,552 --> 01:10:57,787
Do it. I mean it.

1495
01:10:57,821 --> 01:11:00,457
I'm sneaking out
right now, okay?

1496
01:11:02,626 --> 01:11:06,530
Matisse's feelings for Loulou

1497
01:11:06,563 --> 01:11:08,732
are perfectly representing

1498
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:12,436
his pure, naked emotion.

1499
01:11:12,469 --> 01:11:16,773
It's as if she's floating
in a yellow sea,

1500
01:11:16,806 --> 01:11:20,377
her large breasts undulating

1501
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:23,012
in golden waves.

1502
01:11:23,046 --> 01:11:25,382
And then, on the right,

1503
01:11:25,415 --> 01:11:29,953
we have the angry
S-S-Soulio, who reminds me...

1504
01:11:29,986 --> 01:11:32,722
Good night.
I'm going to sleep now.

1505
01:11:32,756 --> 01:11:33,857
Good night.

1506
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:35,325
Look at her heart,

1507
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:38,662
which is like an angry,
meat-like globe.

1508
01:11:38,695 --> 01:11:41,631
This nun is so deep.

1509
01:11:44,668 --> 01:11:46,603
Jen, get in here!

1510
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:49,406
You're the one who knows
all about throwing up.

1511
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:51,875
Yeah, but I can't stand
watching anyone else doing it.

1512
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:54,544
Anyway, shouldn't we take her

1513
01:11:54,578 --> 01:11:55,979
to the hospital or whatever?

1514
01:11:56,012 --> 01:11:58,081
No, my parents are gonna
be home any minute.

1515
01:11:58,114 --> 01:11:59,383
They'll kill me.

1516
01:11:59,416 --> 01:12:00,950
I thought that was the point.

1517
01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:02,719
Jen, can you be sensitive?

1518
01:12:02,752 --> 01:12:04,988
My life is fucking hell.

1519
01:12:05,021 --> 01:12:06,089
What happened?

1520
01:12:06,122 --> 01:12:08,658
I thought everything
was going really well for you.

1521
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,128
Like when?

1522
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:14,431
Like when you were
on the cover of YM.

1523
01:12:14,464 --> 01:12:16,666
You said you got free
drinks at every club.

1524
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:19,068
Nell, you're, like, so beautiful

1525
01:12:19,102 --> 01:12:21,137
and so smart and...

1526
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,672
and blasé.

1527
01:12:22,706 --> 01:12:24,874
Everyone wants to be like you.

1528
01:12:24,908 --> 01:12:26,710
Nobody really knows me.

1529
01:12:27,744 --> 01:12:28,912
Oh, Nelly.

1530
01:12:28,945 --> 01:12:31,147
How many Prozacs did you take?

1531
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,617
I don't know.
Three.

1532
01:12:33,650 --> 01:12:34,718
Three?

1533
01:12:36,052 --> 01:12:38,154
I thought you took
the whole bottle.

1534
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:40,156
That's all that was left.

1535
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,691
Ahh...

1536
01:12:45,462 --> 01:12:47,163
I guess that's all of 'em, then.

1537
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,632
Gross.

1538
01:12:48,665 --> 01:12:50,700
Uch, plus the bird just shat.

1539
01:12:54,471 --> 01:12:56,440
Get away from me, bunny.

1540
01:13:01,778 --> 01:13:04,748
Of course, I'm aware that you
snuck out last night.

1541
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:08,752
But I want you to know

1542
01:13:08,785 --> 01:13:11,855
that I, uh, spent the whole
night meditating on it,

1543
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:14,924
and I, uh, I understand

1544
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:16,693
that you... You're probably upset

1545
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:20,697
about your father's
so-called financial crisis.

1546
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:23,800
So I've decided to move
beyond grounding

1547
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:25,735
as a means of discipline.

1548
01:13:26,803 --> 01:13:30,106
I still feel that you have
not behaved responsibly,

1549
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:33,710
but I... I can only advise you

1550
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:36,880
and hope that you
respect my opinion.

1551
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:38,615
Thanks.

1552
01:13:38,648 --> 01:13:40,416
You're welcome.

1553
01:13:49,225 --> 01:13:50,760
And now, for a special treat,

1554
01:13:50,794 --> 01:13:52,228
we're taking you

1555

01:13:53,897 --> 01:13:55,031

We could care less about Henry.

1584
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:39,335
We think he's a freak.

1585
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:41,270
But we understand your need

1586
01:15:41,304 --> 01:15:43,673
to find out if he's
a stud on stage

1587
01:15:43,707 --> 01:15:47,644
since he was such
a dud in the mud.

1588
01:15:47,677 --> 01:15:49,312
I thought he was off your list.

1589
01:15:49,345 --> 01:15:52,315
You know, I've got
this awful feeling

1590
01:15:52,348 --> 01:15:53,917

with that "ovulating

I don't know.

1645
01:18:48,324 --> 01:18:50,760
They do look kinda touchy-feely.

1646
01:18:50,794 --> 01:18:54,097
Whatever. All those
rock 'n' rollers are sluts.

1647
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:55,498
Maybe she's bi.

1648

1653
01:19:09,345 --> 01:19:10,980
I told you to wait out front.

1654
01:19:11,014 --> 01:19:14,784
Well, I didn't say you could
go get a cup of coffee.

1655
01:19:14,818 --> 01:19:16,853

1662
01:19:27,030 --> 01:19:28,798
She's all out of Prozac.

1663
01:19:28,832 --> 01:19:31,534
What's she gonna do,
O.D. on St. John's Wort?

Well...

1708

You were right.

1716
01:22:36,019 --> 01:22:40,289

It's great.

1729
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:48,091

1732
01:23:53,129 --> 01:23:55,164
now that I've finally freed Judy

1733
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:56,732

frustrated I've been.

1735
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:02,171

1736
01:24:02,205 --> 01:24:04,107
I'm a born businesswoman.

1737
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:06,442
Who was I trying to kid
with that photography idea?

1738
01:24:06,475 --> 01:24:08,544
A lot of your photos
are really good.

1739
01:24:08,577 --> 01:24:11,714
Thanks, but, you know,
I have to consider it, like, a hobby.

1740
01:24:11,747 --> 01:24:13,849
I mean, the minute I
start thinking about it

1741
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:15,651
as a professional thing,

1742
01:24:15,684 --> 01:24:18,454
I get so... I get so,
um, claustrophobic.

1743
01:24:18,487 --> 01:24:21,090
I can't go near a darkroom.

1744
01:24:21,124 --> 01:24:23,826
Mom, you are so self-actualized.

1745
01:24:23,859 --> 01:24:25,594
Well, it's about time.

1746
01:24:25,628 --> 01:24:27,796
You know, I've been
so overwhelmed

1747
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:29,398
with my own stuff,

1748
01:24:29,432 --> 01:24:33,236
I haven't really...
really understood

1749
01:24:33,269 --> 01:24:35,638
what you were going
through as a young woman,

1750
01:24:35,671 --> 01:24:37,806
and, you know, I'm sorry.

1751
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,808
I'm really sorry.

1752
01:24:39,842 --> 01:24:41,677

1760
01:25:12,241 --> 01:25:13,176
You're gonna love it.

1761
01:25:13,209 --> 01:25:14,510

1762
01:25:14,543 --> 01:25:15,711

1765
01:25:18,881 --> 01:25:21,217

1766
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:23,552
but he finally found the
right person to bribe.

1768
01:25:25,254 --> 01:25:26,722
Yes, I got in,

1769
01:25:26,755 --> 01:25:29,492
and my mom finally released
her inner-entrepreneur,

1770
01:25:29,525 --> 01:25:31,927
so now she's sure
she can help me pay for it.

1771
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,263
That's so good.
That's really nice.

1772
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:40,469
You know, he got
into Harvard and Yale.

1773
01:25:40,503 --> 01:25:43,339
So he'll either be in
my class or yours, Nell.

1774
01:25:43,372 --> 01:25:45,208
Oh, not mine.
I'm not going.

1775
01:25:45,241 --> 01:25:46,709
What?
You've got to be kidding.

1776
01:25:46,742 --> 01:25:48,177
After all that work?

1777
01:25:48,211 --> 01:25:49,945
Oh, God, Nell,
your poor parents.

1778
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:51,547
They're gonna commit hari-kari.

1779
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:53,216
I'm not doing anything

1780
01:25:53,249 --> 01:25:54,450
that feels wrong anymore.

1781
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:56,419
Maybe I'll join the Peace Corps

1782
01:25:56,452 --> 01:25:57,886
and go to school afterwards.

1783
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,489

01:26:45,334 --> 01:26:47,970
I was really, um...

1796
01:26:48,003 --> 01:26:49,872
I just wanted you to know

1797
01:26:49,905 --> 01:26:51,674
that I think
about you sometimes,

1798
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:54,677
and I'm sorry
if I acted like a jerk.

1799
01:26:55,911 --> 01:26:57,446
I'll go out with you.

1800
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,715
You will?

1801
01:26:59,748 --> 01:27:01,917
You want some time
to think about it?

1802
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:05,654
No. I don't need time
to think about it.

1803
01:27:16,465 --> 01:27:19,902
I mean, is commitment
a bad thing, you know?

1804
01:27:53,836 --> 01:27:55,070
So how come you never kissed me

1805
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:56,539
that night in the park?

1806
01:27:58,374 --> 01:27:59,875
I was nervous.

1807
01:27:59,908 --> 01:28:01,444
Really?

1808
01:28:01,477 --> 01:28:03,679
But you're a rocker.

1809
01:28:05,047 --> 01:28:06,449
Well, I don't...

1810
01:28:06,482 --> 01:28:08,817
I don't kiss people
I barely know.

1811
01:28:08,851 --> 01:28:11,754
Oh. Well,
that's a good policy.

1812
01:28:17,493 --> 01:28:19,027
Listen.

1813
01:28:19,061 --> 01:28:23,098
I've got some things
I want to show you, okay?

1814
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:25,033
Okay.

1815
01:28:25,067 --> 01:28:28,404
I've got some things
to show you, too.

1816
01:28:30,873 --> 01:28:32,541
Me first.

1817
01:29:48,150 --> 01:29:49,652
Mmm...

1818
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:56,525
Ohh...

1819
01:30:00,629 --> 01:30:02,097
Ahh...
