1
00:00:33,216 --> 00:00:35,595
Pumpkin, are you okay?

2
00:00:35,595 --> 00:00:37,329
Is that a truck?

3
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:42,851
Stephen. Stephen.

4
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,373
- Well, hello there, darling.

5
00:03:37,373 --> 00:03:39,418
I know you weren't expecting me.

6
00:03:41,984 --> 00:03:43,393
Yeah, that's right.

7
00:03:43,393 --> 00:03:46,623
I followed you up from that
trail a little while ago.

8
00:03:47,934 --> 00:03:51,407
I figured you were coming here
with your short boyfriend.

9
00:03:54,171 --> 00:03:55,100
- You're freaking crazy.

10
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,853
Where do you come up with this stuff?

11
00:03:56,853 --> 00:03:58,973
- A 10-hour workday is a long workday.

12
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,788
I get a little bored.

13
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,670
- So, you're taking me out
to, what is this place?

14
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,410
A place that was important
to your grandfather or?

15
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,440
You've been here before?

16
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,273
What was the deal?

17
00:04:10,273 --> 00:04:11,940
I wasn't really paying attention.

18
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,710
- When I used to live on the reservation,

19
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,640
my grandfather used to
take me to this place.

20
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,903
And we would get lost in
the woods for a few days.

21
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,463
He'd take me hunting and
fishing, and all that good stuff.

22
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,190
It's just the woods
that I used to play in.

23
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,540
I grew up here.

24
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,200
I made a lot of great memories
with my grandfather there.

25
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,780
I was just thinking we could
go make our own memories.

26
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,451
- Well, I like the sound of that.

27
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:43,658
All right.

28
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,357
- Are you really gonna wear those shoes?

29
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,483
- What are you talking about?

30
00:04:54,483 --> 00:04:55,316
These are my lucky chucks.

31
00:04:55,316 --> 00:04:57,500
I was wearing these when I met you.

32
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,663
- Well, I got you something.

33
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:02,683
- Oh.

34
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,800
Gray and brown, my two favorite colors.

35
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,020
- Yeah, I figured you could...

36
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,698
- And it's almost my size too.

37
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:13,466
- Almost.

38
00:05:13,466 --> 00:05:16,060
- So, you want me to hike in shoes

39
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,663
that are ugly and don't fit?

40
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,210
Well, this is the point of no return.

41
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,043
You know what I mean?

42
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:24,590
This is three effing
days in the wilderness.

43
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,310
Do you have, I mean...

44
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,120
Woo, that's a little heavy there.

45
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,360
We gotta carry this for three days?

46
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,000
We gotta small tent?

47
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,833
Are you sure this is okay?

48
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:32,960
Have you done this before?

49
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,150
How long has it been since
you done this before?

50
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,153
This is kind of-

51
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,013
- Hush.

52
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:50,014
- There's worse things to do

53
00:05:50,014 --> 00:05:51,320
than follow that around for three days.

54
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:24,978
hidden in the silence

55
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:39,125
I think it's all a show

56
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:45,049
to show you where to go

57
00:06:53,303 --> 00:06:58,303
over, it's over, it's over

58
00:07:01,183 --> 00:07:06,183
in the distant moonlight

59
00:07:12,914 --> 00:07:14,790
- Did I ever tell you
about the pro-wrestler

60
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,745
that I knew from Mississippi?

61
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:18,030
- No.

62
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,080
- Back in the '90s, anywhere you went,

63
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,190
no matter how shitty the wrestling was,

64
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,140
people would sell out.

65
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,350
'Cause Stone Cold and The
Rock were big at the time.

66
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,920
And I knew this guy,

67
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,040
and I don't even remember
what his real name was,

68
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,350
but he would show up to the matches

69
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,830
in a sleeveless black T-shirt

70
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,860
with matching black blue jeans.

71
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,660
And then he would have this plastic sack.

72
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,890
And in the plastic sack was
his outfit for the night.

73
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,230
You know what it was?

74
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,220
What?

75
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,130
It was another sleeveless T- shirt.

76
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,440
So he would get into the dressing room,

77
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,410
take that shirt off,

78
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,890
and put another black
sleeveless T-shirt on,

79
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,260
and now he was ready to fight.

80
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,337
So, this guy came up to
me once and he was like,

81
00:07:55,337 --> 00:07:57,440
"Hey Vinnie, I know your good

82
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,690
with all the gimmicks and everything,

83
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,950
and I got the look down.

84
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,660
I know I look good.

85
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,067
But I need an idea that's
gonna set me apart."

86
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,804
And this guy was the worst, he was a dork.

87
00:08:08,804 --> 00:08:11,120
He was a redneck dork.

88
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,910
If there is such a thing.

89
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,040
So I sat there for a few minutes,

90
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,873
and I said,

91
00:08:14,873 --> 00:08:17,850
"Hey man, have you ever
played mortal combat?"

92
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,500
He's like, "Yeah, man,
I love mortal combat."

93
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,630
And I said, "You know,
when you kill somebody,

94
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,970
and it says fatality?"

95
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,070
He said, "Yeah."

96
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:31,396
I said, "How about for
you, instead of fatality,

97
00:08:31,396 --> 00:08:33,810
because you look kind of like an animal,

98
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:36,917
how about you go by beastiality?"

99
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,333
He had no idea.

100
00:08:41,414 --> 00:08:44,177
- That's cool.
- His eyes got big as saucers.

101
00:08:44,177 --> 00:08:46,550
"Yes. Yes."

102
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,090
So that night, he's charged up,

103
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,690
he's excited, he's ready to go.

104
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:54,197
He goes outside the
curtain, place is packed.

105
00:08:54,197 --> 00:08:57,730
"Who's ready for some beastiality?"

106
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,520
The whole place goes sideways.

107
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,118
The women with their kids, they're like,

108
00:09:01,118 --> 00:09:02,790
"What in the hell are we about..."

109
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,623
They didn't know

110
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:05,280
if they're gonna bring
out a sheep or something.

111
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,930
They had no idea.

112
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,910
The college aged kids were
laughing their ass off.

113
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,380
He went in the ring, he got the guy down,

114
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,627
the guy was on all fours.

115
00:09:13,627 --> 00:09:16,547
"Who's ready for some beastiality?"

116
00:09:17,793 --> 00:09:21,470
And he never, ever, ever had
reaction like that in his life.

117
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,150
He came back, he hugged me.

118
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,320
He's not a hugger. He hugged me.

119
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,127
And he was saying, "Man,
this is the best shit."

120
00:09:27,127 --> 00:09:29,290
And he goes, "Man, thank you so much."

121
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,880
Word about this guy travels for weeks.

122
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,357
People are driving miles to see him.

123
00:09:34,357 --> 00:09:35,440
"Beastiality."

124
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,210
Place going crazy. "Beastiality."

125
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,780
He's so happy.

126
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,060
And I feel like an asshole,

127
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,470
because everybody's making fun of him.

128
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,303
- You're an asshole.

129
00:09:43,303 --> 00:09:44,136
- I know.

130
00:09:44,136 --> 00:09:46,343
Then six weeks later, I see him again.

131
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,290
Totally pissed off this time.

132
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,144
I said, "Hey, what's up, beastiality?"

133
00:09:51,144 --> 00:09:54,320
He said, "Shut up. You know what you did."

134
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,340
Apparently, he ran into
some promoter from Ohio

135
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,600
who was a born again Christian.

136
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,170
He did one of the church shows,

137
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,440
where they try to save everybody.

138
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,237
After the main event, they're like,

139
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:05,510
"There's no way in heck I'm letting you

140
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,940
go out there and say beastiality

141
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,570
in front of a bunch of
born again Christians."

142
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,713
And so, man, he had to give
up the gimmick,

143
00:10:15,268 --> 00:10:16,937
Beastiality.

144
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:20,312
- That's a great story.

145
00:10:20,312 --> 00:10:21,145
- Oh, thank you.

146
00:10:21,145 --> 00:10:22,645
- You are welcomed.

147
00:10:22,645 --> 00:10:26,310
Where are we going,
girl? You know I love you?

148
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,610
- I know you think you do.

149
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,443
- What you got?

150
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,653
- That is disturbing.

151
00:10:45,718 --> 00:10:48,318
- It's weird, being out
here in the woods like that.

152
00:10:50,402 --> 00:10:52,470
- Who would leave this out here?

153
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:55,373
- Obviously a guy, and he's
probably looking for it.

154
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,483
To this day

155
00:11:26,483 --> 00:11:28,175
you don't know the difference
between .

156
00:11:28,175 --> 00:11:30,200
I used to live upstairs
from this professor,

157
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,170
and every time I asked him,

158
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,043
he was like-
- Hey. What is that?

159
00:11:33,887 --> 00:11:35,650
- Oh, it looks like a woman's purse.

160
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,100
Could be full of cash.

161
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,150
Gold.
- It's very gender, isn't it?

162
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,013
- Okay. It's a gay man's purse.

163
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,550
You got very nice arms.

164
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:48,923
- Thank you.

165
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,030
- I'll take that for you.

166
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,073
Ooh. It's filled with Krabby Patties.

167
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,423
Think there's anything on there?

168
00:11:59,423 --> 00:12:00,256
- I don't know.

169
00:12:00,256 --> 00:12:01,559
- Nudie pics?

170
00:12:02,392 --> 00:12:03,940
- You wish.

171
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,640
See if there's a battery in there.

172
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,550
- Is that a battery?

173
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,273
- I think so.

174
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,023
- Beautiful.

175
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,400
I'm gonna eat these.

176
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,650
You want one? There's three left.

177
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,150
- No, and that's disgusting.

178
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,770
- They're very good for you.

179
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,623
Sponge Bob eats them. He's very thin.

180
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,450
These are like peaches children take.

181
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,283
- He's cute.

182
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:32,830
- I want to see boobs.

183
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,993
- Oh!

184
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,527
Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

185
00:12:43,717 --> 00:12:45,470
We have to get this to the police.

186
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,440
- Okay. But where's the police out here?

187
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,550
- I don't know. Check the map.

188
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,383
- Okay.

189
00:12:49,383 --> 00:12:50,630
Whoa, whoa, slow down
and think for a second.

190
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:54,420
You know where ranger
stations are and stuff, right?

191
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,770
- Yeah, I think so.

192
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,440
It's supposed to be on this trail.

193
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,943
If we just keep walking,
maybe we'll come across it.

194
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,173
- All right. Let's go, baby.

195
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,033
That's crazy.

196
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,753
Fuck this Krabby Patty.

197
00:13:26,781 --> 00:13:28,240
Hey man, you all right?

198
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,073
Need some help?

199
00:13:35,516 --> 00:13:36,950
Hey brother, you're all right, man?

200
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,783
What happened?

201
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:39,930
- Twisted my knee.

202
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,300
I come back to my car.

203
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,240
- Okay. Where's your gear?

204
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,680
- Ah, I left it up on the mountain.

205
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,180
I couldn't really carry it back with me.

206
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,314
- Well, I can go get that for you.

207
00:13:47,314 --> 00:13:48,940
Come here. What're you doing?
- Everything okay?

208
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,520
- Of course not. Call 911.

209
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,300
- We can't. There's no service out here.

210
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,240
- Go fucking to the clearing, and call.

211
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,210
We gotta at least try.

212
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,980
I mean, I don't know what else
to do with this fucking guy.

213
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,880
- I don't have my phone.

214
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,713
- You don't have your phone?

215
00:14:01,713 --> 00:14:03,978
I'm sorry, I got your phone.

216
00:14:11,294 --> 00:14:13,570
- She's a beautiful girl.

217
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,756
You're lucky, man.

218
00:14:14,756 --> 00:14:15,589
- I know, man.

219
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:17,890
I don't know what she's
doing with me sometimes bro.

220
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,810
I'm a lucky bastard.

221
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,993
- I don't either.

222
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,910
Cherokee should stick to their own kind.

223
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,810
Their blood's already polluted enough.

224
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,943
- What?

225
00:14:27,943 --> 00:14:29,930
- Don't get me wrong.

226
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,147
It's not like that.

227
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,930
The Cherokee breed out,

228
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,680
soon the whole nation will be gone.

229
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,453
Sad, really.

230
00:14:39,148 --> 00:14:40,443
I got no signal.

231
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,823
- Let me check with the Mrs.

232
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,810
- I have no signal.

233
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,250
- Well, I told you to go
to the fucking clearing.

234
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,760
And I know it's 30 minutes,

235
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,310
you've been gone for 30 seconds,

236
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,466
but let me tell you
something, that's okay.

237
00:14:54,466 --> 00:14:56,020
This guy's a freaking weirdo.

238
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,610
I don't know if he can hear me.

239
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,310
So be careful.

240
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:02,890
But this guy was talking
about you being Cherokee,

241
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,090
and talking about you wiping
out the Cherokee he mentioned

242
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,720
'cause your mom's half white or something.

243
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,553
I was like,

244
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:10,450
"Is this guy a racist or is
he a soothsayer or a witch?"

245
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,300
And dude, he's really freaking weird.

246
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,210
And here's the other thing,

247
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,610
he looks like my uncle Tony.

248
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,190
You met Tony, right?

249
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,809
- Isn't Tony 60?

250
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:21,403
- Yeah, but he looks like Tony did

251
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:23,120
when he used to bring
to me to these woods.

252
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,460
'Cause I know I hate hiking,

253
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,393
but I fished here before with Tony.

254
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,100
And he looks just like the guy.

255
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,300
It's fucking weird, but
he didn't talk like Tony.

256
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,376
Tony's a cool guy...

257
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,725
- Where the fuck did he go?

258
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,110
Did he take anything?

259
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,090
- I don't think so, man.

260
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,773
Where the hell did he go?

261
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,883
- I really don't even know
how to process this right now.

262
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:54,600
- I don't know how to process it, baby.

263
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,613
We getting the fuck out of this place.

264
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,560
- I wonder if that's who's
taking the Polaroids.

265
00:16:41,942 --> 00:16:43,800
- I wonder where the nest is.

266
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,900
- Honey, I think that's a rattlesnake egg.

267
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,385
- Don't tip the woods.

268
00:16:58,918 --> 00:16:59,751
I'm not gonna make it

269
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:02,950
the last two damn miles to the camp site.

270
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,873
- Well, why don't we just hike up there?

271
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,570
- Oh, and do a camp for tonight?

272
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,000
- Well, what I have in mind,

273
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,022
we might as well stay out
in the middle of nowhere.

274
00:17:14,022 --> 00:17:15,673
- Oh really?

275
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,810
Well then, hell yeah.

276
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,590
- Wait, what do you have in mind?

277
00:17:22,423 --> 00:17:23,360
- What do you have in mind?
- 'Cause I don't think

278
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,600
it's the same thing I have in mind.

279
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,820
- I just rolled my ankle.

280
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,940
9 million miles in this damn forest.

281
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,640
Oh!

282
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,450
- My bracelet broke.

283
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,283
- Who cares?

284
00:17:32,283 --> 00:17:33,900
That looks like your
grandmother's phone cord.

285
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,200
I was actually hoping that it would break.

286
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,680
Loaded bag.

287
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,810
You said you could put up
a tent by yourself, right?

288
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:40,643
- Yes.

289
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:41,787
- Gotta do manly. I love you.

290
00:17:41,787 --> 00:17:44,960
I'm gonna go secure the
perimeter with my manliness.

291
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,900
- Okay. Have fun.

292
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,635
- And testosterone.

293
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:48,468
- See ya.

294
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:49,422
- And my balls.

295
00:18:20,645 --> 00:18:23,728
- I have an idea, we could eat these.

296
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:29,210
The finest spawn guy that
cow shit has ever produced.

297
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,043
- Four years together,

298
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:32,800
and he finally talked me into eating shit.

299
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,810
- It'll be fun.

300
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,900
Shamans used to use these in ceremonies

301
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,870
when they would walk through the worlds.

302
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:38,790
- Really?

303
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,410
- Yeah.

304
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,120
I think you we could use them to connect.

305
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,070
Connect to the trees and the squirrels,

306
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,773
the spirits of the forest.

307
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,530
- You wanna do mushrooms out in the woods,

308
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,970
with Polaroid killer out?

309
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,580
- Can you think of anything better to do?

310
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,060
- Ah, yeah.

311
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,627
- We may do that too.

312
00:19:10,371 --> 00:19:12,730
I never felt my nipples like this before.

313
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,241
through the darkest night

314
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,383
when the wolves strike

315
00:19:39,383 --> 00:19:41,795
get your aim right

316
00:19:41,795 --> 00:19:45,823
pound on the fame right

317
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:54,132
that they ain't got paid

318
00:19:54,132 --> 00:19:58,539
gonna lose it out anyway

319
00:21:00,984 --> 00:21:05,340
of flesh and blood

320
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,593
- All hail Lord Leviathan.

321
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,910
Jesus! What are you doing?

322
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,524
- Oh, Hey man. How's it going?

323
00:21:18,524 --> 00:21:20,851
- Oh, hey, how's it going?

324
00:21:20,851 --> 00:21:22,360
Don't mind us.

325
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,110
You want a piece of this?

326
00:21:35,718 --> 00:21:36,551
- No!

327
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,869
- What the fuck.

328
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:48,702
Oh!

329
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:54,470
Jesus Christ, what the hell!

330
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,040
Are you okay?

331
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,207
- Yeah. I'm fine.

332
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,103
- Motherfuckers.

333
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,760
What the fuck?

334
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,660
Who was it? Are you okay?

335
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,220
- Yeah.
- What the fuck, motherfucker?

336
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,053
Come out here.

337
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,763
I'm from Baltimore, bitch.

338
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:31,730
Hey baby.

339
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,220
- Good morning.

340
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,053
- Good morning.

341
00:23:36,897 --> 00:23:38,580
You're beautiful.

342
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,500
What's on the agenda today, boss?

343
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,510
- I figured we could take the
camera bag and the Polaroids

344
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,050
to the ranger station.

345
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,750
- Ooh, that camera bag.
Do I still have that?

346
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,965
- Yeah. It's in your backpack.

347
00:23:47,965 --> 00:23:49,170
- Okay, cool.

348
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,605
Let's get going.

349
00:23:50,605 --> 00:23:51,813
- All right.

350
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:10,273
- I'm thirsty.

351
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,733
- Oh, my God!

352
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,793
- That was one for you.

353
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,480
- Because it's a guy?

354
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,168
- Oh, yeah.

355
00:24:23,168 --> 00:24:24,660
Unless you got something to tell me.

356
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,760
- This is really starting to creep me out.

357
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,450
- It's weird.

358
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,210
But it's just somebody
screwing around with us.

359
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,700
I bet it's an art house project.

360
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,890
I bet there's a candid
camera in the woods.

361
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,985
Rocky and Bullwinkle pulling one of-

362
00:24:37,985 --> 00:24:39,153
- I really hope you're right.

363
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,283
I feel like somebody is watching us.

364
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,620
- Somebody is watching.

365
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,920
I'd say that Indian voodoo witchcraft.

366
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,850
You feel it in your dreadlocks?

367
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,548
- Vinnie, I'm serious.

368
00:24:54,548 --> 00:24:58,290
- I know. I just joke when I'm worried.

369
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,190
- I have to pee.

370
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,023
- Okay.

371
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,783
Snapchat me.

372
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:52,983
- You can go now.

373
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,580
- Don't be like that, uh.

374
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,860
- Hey, come look at this.

375
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,090
- Baby, you're fine as
wine, but I ain't R Kelly.

376
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,410
I'm not into that shit.

377
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:32,610
- Not that.

378
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,933
I wanna show you something.

379
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,160
- Okay.

380
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,560
Why don't you bring it out to me,

381
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,713
so I don't have to break my damn neck.

382
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,893
- Just look.

383
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,147
It's made out of deer
hide and .

384
00:26:49,002 --> 00:26:51,010
It's like the one my
grandfather used to make.

385
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:51,843
- Cool.

386
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,730
You put it on, huh?

387
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,188
- Why not?

388
00:26:56,188 --> 00:26:58,357
- A bear could've crapped on it.

389
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,321
Thank you.

390
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:06,115
- You're welcomed.

391
00:27:06,115 --> 00:27:06,948
Be careful.

392
00:27:06,948 --> 00:27:08,080
This one's a doozy over here.

393
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:09,879
- You're a doozy.

394
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:10,712
- Thank you.

395
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,420
That's the nicest thing you've
said to me all day, I'm sure.

396
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,083
Where's this fucking forest ranger station

397
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:16,493
that I hear so much about?

398
00:27:17,372 --> 00:27:18,489
I don't know.

399
00:27:18,489 --> 00:27:19,890
Everything looks unfamiliar.

400
00:27:54,501 --> 00:27:56,217
- Oh, little buddy.

401
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:57,384
What happened.

402
00:27:59,395 --> 00:28:02,008
Oh, one cute little guy.

403
00:28:02,008 --> 00:28:02,841
You okay?

404
00:28:14,495 --> 00:28:15,328
Moron.

405
00:28:26,942 --> 00:28:28,859
- I'm not peeing there.

406
00:28:32,453 --> 00:28:33,286
- Freak.

407
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,220
How'd you get over there, Houdini?

408
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,330
What are you doing?

409
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,833
What are you wearing?

410
00:29:05,673 --> 00:29:06,720
This is crazy.

411
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,487
I'm not in the mood to screw around.

412
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:15,863
- Vinnie.

413
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,563
- What are you doing? Come here.

414
00:29:45,588 --> 00:29:46,421
- Vinnie.

415
00:29:48,032 --> 00:29:48,865
- Robin.

416
00:29:54,465 --> 00:29:56,882
I'm not in the mood for this.

417
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,320
What are you doing? Come here.

418
00:30:13,626 --> 00:30:14,459
I never want to hear that

419
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:16,615
I'm the one that screws around.

420
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:19,151
This is freaking ridiculous.

421
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,263
Robin.

422
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,500
How did you get up there?

423
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:08,389
Would you cut it out?

424
00:31:21,281 --> 00:31:22,570
Freaking time getting a role-play.

425
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,043
I ain't moving, my feet hurt.

426
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,550
Hey, what the hell was that?

427
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,460
What were you doing?

428
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,560
What were you wearing?

429
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,470
Why the fuck did you go off like that?

430
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,530
I thought you were peeing over there.

431
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,363
That was crazy.

432
00:31:57,363 --> 00:31:59,200
I almost fell off a cliff!

433
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,150
Some weird ass redneck saved
me, and he disappeared.

434
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,320
What in the hell is going?

435
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,780
And you're wearing that
damned necklace again.

436
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,087
- What are you talking about?

437
00:32:10,087 --> 00:32:11,863
- What do you mean you don't
know what I'm talking about?

438
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:13,970
I about died, about fell off a cliff,

439
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,040
a redneck had to save me.

440
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,080
You were leading me through,
wearing this Indian gab,

441
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,310
looking like Sacagawea,

442
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,530
and you're acting like gypsy Rose Lee.

443
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:24,470
What in the world?

444
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,970
I about died over here.

445
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,040
Then you're wearing-
- I have no idea

446
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,873
what you're talking about.

447
00:32:27,873 --> 00:32:29,040
- And you're wearing the thing again.

448
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,873
The knapsack.

449
00:32:29,873 --> 00:32:31,090
I'm telling you.
- Vinnie, calm down.

450
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,013
What are you talking about?

451
00:32:32,013 --> 00:32:34,770
- I about fell off a cliff.

452
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:35,913
I can't be gone.

453
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,490
Man, just get this stuff.

454
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,640
Let's start walking.

455
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,110
If you got to screw around, man,

456
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,610
somebody could get hurt, babe.

457
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,746
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.

458
00:32:48,746 --> 00:32:50,330
- I don't know what I'm talking about.

459
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:53,450
Have you ever almost fell
off of a cliff before?

460
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:56,280
God almighty! I saw the face of Thor.

461
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,100
It was insane, and Zeus.

462
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,200
- Maybe you should watch
where the hell you're going.

463
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,470
- Well, maybe you shouldn't be

464
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:04,497
sexually trying to entice
me off of a cliff face.

465
00:33:04,497 --> 00:33:05,804
Have you ever thought about that?

466
00:33:05,804 --> 00:33:07,592
- I'm telling you I have no
idea what you're talking about.

467
00:33:07,592 --> 00:33:08,425
I was peeing.

468
00:33:08,425 --> 00:33:10,696
- You know I have a thing for you, right?

469
00:33:10,696 --> 00:33:12,576
I'm gonna follow you follow you...

470
00:33:22,641 --> 00:33:23,800
I thought I said quit
wearing this stupid? -

471
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,070
- Don't touch me.

472
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,012
- Ouch! What's the
fucking matter with you?

473
00:33:29,735 --> 00:33:30,829
- Just leave me alone.

474
00:33:30,829 --> 00:33:31,662
- Hey.

475
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:29,789
Billy.

476
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,669
- Go for Billy.

477
00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:36,600
Hey Billy.

478
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,010
Remember you're gonna be on duty

479
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,210
by yourself all weekend.

480
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:42,537
Is there anything you
need before we take off?

481
00:34:48,441 --> 00:34:49,274
What?

482
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,010
- Nothing. I'll be fine.

483
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,903
Y'all just enjoy your big
holiday weekend, okay?

484
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,610
Yeah. Thanks Billy.

485
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,524
Oh, before I forget,

486
00:35:00,524 --> 00:35:04,441
.

487
00:35:04,441 --> 00:35:07,087
Let's see, it was near campsite...

488
00:35:07,087 --> 00:35:08,087
- Ah, would shut up.

489
00:35:22,778 --> 00:35:24,528
- This is disgusting.

490
00:35:27,176 --> 00:35:31,613
Baby, if you used tampons for
a tent, you're looking at it.

491
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,120
Don't touch it, man.

492
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,800
Hey, you're still a thing.

493
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,633
It's all over that.

494
00:35:36,633 --> 00:35:38,091
I'm not gonna touch it.

495
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:48,590
- Hey, it's forest ranger.

496
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,650
- We found this bag.

497
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:54,483
- Yeah.

498
00:35:54,483 --> 00:35:56,370
- A while back on the trail.

499
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,203
- Yeah.

500
00:35:57,203 --> 00:35:59,850
It's got suspicious pictures of...

501
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:03,063
Look there's these
Polaroids of people bound,

502
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,193
and naked chicks.

503
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,193
Yeah.

504
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,773
And this bag too.

505
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,539
There's a camera-

506
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:16,989
- Wait, that has my necklace.

507
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:19,160
- Oh.

508
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,420
Buddy, you're all right?

509
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,719
We're talking here.

510
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:22,552
- Uh?

511
00:36:22,552 --> 00:36:24,490
- You want us to leave
this stuff with you?

512
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:26,420
Are people in trouble or what's going on?

513
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,880
- You know, there's a ranger station

514
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,020
about a mile, mile and a
half way back up there.

515
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,897
Just take that with you.

516
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,720
- You're busy, huh?

517
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,553
- Yeah.

518
00:36:42,553 --> 00:36:44,760
I'm working on this big caper.

519
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,610
- I'm sorry, is it more
important than people in trouble?

520
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,620
Yeah, big forest caper. Big stuff.

521
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,240
- Hey, it's your job, right?

522
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,520
To protect people, and at
least give us peace of mind.

523
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,670
And these people may be in trouble, man.

524
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,510
Aren't you a cop?

525
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,150
I mean, you know what a forest ranger is?

526
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,630
Isn't this your job, sir?

527
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,463
- Look.

528
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,493
Just go up to the ranger
station, and leave a report.

529
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,430
I got stuff to do.

530
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,720
- Apparently.

531
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,770
Let's go, sweetheart.

532
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,443
Taxpayer money.

533
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,703
- All right.

534
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:31,663
You shoot him, and I cut him.

535
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:36,738
- What the hell did you say?

536
00:37:36,738 --> 00:37:38,073
- You shut the fuck up, Scott.

537
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,073
Damn, Scott.

538
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:57,117
You can cook anything.

539
00:37:57,117 --> 00:37:58,495
- Uh, he sure did.

540
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,030
Whose turn is it to follow?

541
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,280
Not me. I cook.

542
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,560
Well, I just got back. So...

543
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,750
I guess I'll go then.

544
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,583
The last that I saw,

545
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:14,440
they were headed towards
the old town of Proctor.

546
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,673
I'm gonna go take a nap.

547
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:19,883
- Baby.

548
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:23,630
Robin, look, man, with
everything that's been going on

549
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,680
here in the freaking
woods, I'm freaking out.

550
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,070
I don't want these freaking
photos anymore, men.

551
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,650
- We'll just take them
to the ranger station.

552
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:31,650
- I don't wanna touch them no more.

553
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,483
I mean, I really think...

554
00:38:32,483 --> 00:38:33,874
I thought it was a joke at first,

555
00:38:33,874 --> 00:38:35,970
but there's something really
fucking weird in these woods,

556
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,397
I don't want any of it.

557
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:02,412
- Devin?

558
00:39:04,473 --> 00:39:05,640
Is that Devin?

559
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:12,520
- If we're talking
about the craziest stuff

560
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,720
and the scariest stuff,

561
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,400
I'll tell you the scariest
thing I've ever seen.

562
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,850
When I first moved to Tennessee,

563
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,150
the first thing I did is

564
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:22,090
I was in a judo tournament in Memphis.

565
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:22,990
- Did you win?

566
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,160
Interesting story.

567
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,780
Basically, the guy in the
final, I got on his back,

568
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,740
arching his neck up like that.

569
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,440
And he was screaming going, "Arg!"

570
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,510
He didn't tap out.

571
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,060
And then the little Asian
guys all got around,

572
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,830
And they basically disqualified me,

573
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,810
'cause they said I was trying
to break the guy's neck.

574
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:49,564
And I was like, "The guy didn't tap out."

575
00:39:49,564 --> 00:39:50,810
And there are supposed
to be some rule in judo,

576
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:52,270
you can't break a guy's back.

577
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:55,958
So anyway, I was pretty
discouraged, I got second place.

578
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:00,240
Here's the scariest thing I've ever seen.

579
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,420
I go back to the hotel

580
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:05,570
I'm going to sleep it off
and cry all night long.

581
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,890
Head down the hall, get on the elevator.

582
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:09,723
What do I see?

583
00:40:09,723 --> 00:40:12,540
There must've been some sort
of freak convention in town,

584
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,920
because the elevator was suddenly filled

585
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,260
with a sea of furies,
six or seven of them.

586
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,333
All at once hop on the elevator.

587
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,480
I thought this was weird,

588
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,700
but they must have had
some sort of symbiosis,

589
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,190
because they all turned around

590
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,800
and looked at me at the same time.

591
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,560
And me being a judo guy in a bad mood,

592
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,714
What the hell was that?

593
00:40:39,714 --> 00:40:40,964
- I don't know.

594
00:40:42,126 --> 00:40:43,352
- Let's keep moving.

595
00:41:16,934 --> 00:41:19,143
do this.

596
00:41:21,903 --> 00:41:23,000
- Are you Devin?

597
00:41:26,601 --> 00:41:28,768
What are doing here, baby?

598
00:41:30,798 --> 00:41:31,965
What the fuck!

599
00:41:59,336 --> 00:42:01,550
- I don't think so.

600
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:04,883
Doesn't look like anybody's
been in here in forever.

601
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,467
I'd say about 150 years.

602
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:11,159
- Now what are you basing that off of?

603
00:42:12,762 --> 00:42:14,606
Is that some sort of expertize?

604
00:42:14,606 --> 00:42:16,379
Is it some sort of carbon dating?

605
00:42:16,379 --> 00:42:18,520
- Well, it's got a confirm foundation.

606
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,502
I think we should call
a real estate agent.

607
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,973
- Man, some ghetto dude
tried to spell Atlanta.

608
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:29,960
- Put that down.

609
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,574
- Why? It's got spiders on it?

610
00:42:31,574 --> 00:42:33,523
- No, don't try to say that name.

611
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,220
Vinnie, let's get out of here.

612
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,473
- Robin.

613
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:40,356
- I don't want to talk about it.

614
00:42:40,356 --> 00:42:41,591
- You don't want to talk about it?

615
00:42:41,591 --> 00:42:44,030
What are you talking about?
- Just drop it.

616
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:44,863
- Drop what?

617
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,950
.

618
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:46,783
- Drop it.

619
00:42:46,783 --> 00:42:49,930
- Hey. You keep your eye on these guys.

620
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,820
I'm gonna see if I will find other guys.

621
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:52,653
- Gotcha.

622
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,460
- Where the hell do you think
you're going off to, honey?

623
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,050
Baby we left our shit back there.

624
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,360
- I just had to get away.

625
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,420
- Okay. I got it.

626
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,050
Sit down. Talk to me for a second.

627
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,050
For the love of God.

628
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:10,130
What is going on, man?

629
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:11,190
Are you kidding?

630
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,023
Are you serious?

631
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,920
- My grandfather used to tell me a story,

632
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,713
when I was a kid, about
the legend of Spear finger.

633
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:24,600
They would just tell kids to scare them.

634
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,957
Keep them from going too far.

635
00:43:26,957 --> 00:43:28,410
"Don't go too far kids,

636
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:30,797
because Spear finger will get you."

637
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:35,280
She was a rock golem with
a spear for a finger,

638
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,260
made out of obsidian.

639
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,000
She would lure the kids
away from the tribes,

640
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,830
and stabbed them in the
hearts with her finger,

641
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,673
and eat their liver.

642
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:47,510
- Okay.

643
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:50,870
After that, white people
drove us out of our lands,

644
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:53,233
and her hunting technique changed.

645
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:56,890
She started dropping trees on people,

646
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:58,710
and mimicking your loved ones,

647
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,810
and luring you into the woods to kill you.

648
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:02,780
- Spear Finger.

649
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,280
This is what you're afraid of?

650
00:44:08,763 --> 00:44:09,660
That it's his name?

651
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:10,960
- It's not a real name.

652
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,410
- Well, what's her real name?

653
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,080
- That name on the board.

654
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:17,693
- Atlanta.

655
00:44:17,693 --> 00:44:18,830
How do you pronounce it?

656
00:44:20,601 --> 00:44:21,851
- We don't say that name.

657
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:24,500
- Okay. Let me get this straight.

658
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,850
So, we're afraid. You're afraid.

659
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:29,190
Your all attitude has changed,

660
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:32,400
because you're scared of a golem woman

661
00:44:33,247 --> 00:44:35,520
coming in and throwing a tree at us.

662
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,459
- Rock golem woman.

663
00:44:37,459 --> 00:44:38,853
- What did I say?

664
00:44:38,853 --> 00:44:40,436
- Rock golem woman.

665
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,668
.

666
00:45:45,057 --> 00:45:47,951
- Well, I saw some boobs.

667
00:45:47,951 --> 00:45:48,868
- So weird.

668
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,983
- They were man boobs.

669
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:12,373
- Somebody's been here,
like a male polish.

670
00:46:14,707 --> 00:46:16,787
Where Scott, out, huh?

671
00:46:16,787 --> 00:46:17,620
- Yeah.

672
00:46:18,673 --> 00:46:21,220
Neither you or him have
a problem with core, huh?

673
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,053
- No, man.

674
00:46:22,053 --> 00:46:23,800
You know I used to be a cop.

675
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,017
Oh, did I ever tell you the story?

676
00:46:25,017 --> 00:46:27,560
Do you know who Charlie Hodge is?

677
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,670
- No.

678
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:29,503
- He's the guy...

679
00:46:29,503 --> 00:46:30,792
Well, you remember Elvis, right?

680
00:46:30,792 --> 00:46:31,625
- Yeah.

681
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:33,440
- So, Charlie Hodge was the
guy that would hand Elvis,

682
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,420
the towels and the scarves on stage, okay?

683
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,183
So, one night when I was on duty,

684
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,330
this guy got stabbed at puckers.

685
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,650
He runs out the back runs cross street,

686
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:44,140
gets in an elevator at a hotel,

687
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,830
takes it up to about the fourth floor.

688
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:46,820
I was first on scene.

689
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,090
Obviously, it's easy to find them.

690
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:49,310
Just blood everywhere.

691
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:50,840
Just follow the blood trail.

692
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,440
Follow it, it's the elevator.

693
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,500
Second floor, no blood.

694
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,690
Got up to the fourth floor, blood bath.

695
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,880
Look off to the left, there's
this guy laying on the floor,

696
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,860
just bleeding out and gurgling.

697
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,540
So, I go over there, and
I'm putting my hands on,

698
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:04,373
getting all bloody.

699
00:47:04,373 --> 00:47:06,930
That's how I'm used to blood.

700
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:08,520
And I'm like, "Oh, I need help."

701
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,353
This guy's dying.

702
00:47:09,353 --> 00:47:11,010
I don't know how quick the
medics are gonna get here.

703
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:13,530
I look up and there's
an Elvis impersonator,

704
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:14,870
walking towards me.

705
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:15,880
Hair and everything.

706
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,967
.

707
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:23,380
With him, is Charlie
Hodge, believe it or not.

708
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,053
Charlie freaking Hodge, man.

709
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:28,617
So he walks up to me, and he goes,

710
00:47:28,617 --> 00:47:31,780
"Hey, officer Walks, is
anything I can do for you?"

711
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:35,860
Suspicious minds.

712
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,187
And Charlie Hodge said,

713
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,920
"Is there anything I can do to help?"

714
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,957
So I look at Charlie Hodges, and say,

715
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:42,967
"Charlie, give me that towel."

716
00:47:46,388 --> 00:47:47,835
- Oh God

717
00:49:33,347 --> 00:49:36,480
- What a fuck.

718
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,580
Mother fucker, where you at?

719
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:40,483
Where are you at?

720
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:43,170
Where are you at, mother fucker?

721
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:46,070
What the hell is that?

722
00:49:47,064 --> 00:49:48,410
Baby is this fucking normal?

723
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:50,493
- No, this is not normal.

724
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:54,260
- I mean, if people can do
this on hikes all the time,

725
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:55,170
this is insane.

726
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:56,003
I can't see...

727
00:49:56,003 --> 00:49:57,100
Where the fuck is the guy?

728
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,440
I don't see anybody.

729
00:50:00,605 --> 00:50:02,641
And what the hell is that thing?

730
00:50:02,641 --> 00:50:04,810
Did you hear that guy's voice again?

731
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:05,643
Or am I going crazy?

732
00:50:05,643 --> 00:50:06,570
- Yeah. No one heard it.

733
00:50:07,795 --> 00:50:09,630
- I got to fucking pee.

734
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:10,930
This is the worst time.

735
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:12,680
You're talking about vulnerability.

736
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,720
Baby, give me about a foot.

737
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,970
I'm gonna little pee shy.

738
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:26,650
Okay. All right.

739
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:28,260
This is your area of expertise.

740
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,573
What do we do first?

741
00:50:29,573 --> 00:50:31,357
- Well first of all,

742
00:50:31,357 --> 00:50:32,500
you tend your brass knuckles around,

743
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,450
the other way, dumb ass.

744
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:35,343
- Okay. Now what?

745
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:37,173
- It looks like...

746
00:50:37,173 --> 00:50:38,466
The sky looks like it's
gonna be dawn soon.

747
00:50:38,466 --> 00:50:41,300
So, I say we just sit outside,

748
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,600
and see if they come back.

749
00:50:43,698 --> 00:50:44,531
- Okay.

750
00:50:44,531 --> 00:50:46,494
That's a good idea.

751
00:50:53,101 --> 00:50:55,255
So, staying awake, okay?

752
00:50:55,255 --> 00:50:57,469
I don't think that would
be a problem at all.

753
00:51:12,581 --> 00:51:13,414
- Vinnie.

754
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:20,692
- Wait, wait.

755
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:35,130
- Y'all need to get out of these woods.

756
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:38,640
I don't think it's safe here.

757
00:51:39,613 --> 00:51:40,923
- Is that a threat?

758
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:42,720
- What do you mean?

759
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,110
- People are going missing.

760
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,820
Now, the cops ain't talking about it.

761
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,387
Maybe they aren't reporting it.

762
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:59,700
If they do, they're just
saying it's rock slides,

763
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,273
trees falling down on people.

764
00:52:02,517 --> 00:52:03,967
Or what are the odds of that?

765
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:09,050
There is something else
going on around here.

766
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:14,660
There's a killer.

767
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:15,790
You've seen the pictures.

768
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:16,934
- How do you know we've seen the pictures?

769
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:19,263
- Wait, are you the one
messing with our tent at night?

770
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,050
- I just got here five minutes ago.

771
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:28,423
As far as I know, you're the killers.

772
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:31,723
And as far as you know,

773
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:34,453
I am.

774
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:37,213
- That's really cute,

775
00:52:37,213 --> 00:52:39,203
coming from somebody out here by himself.

776
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,543
- I ain't alone.

777
00:52:55,419 --> 00:52:58,000
- Where'd you guys get that camera bag?

778
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,630
- We found it on the trail yesterday.

779
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:03,710
- Put the bag on the ground and walk away.

780
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:04,543
- That's okay.

781
00:53:04,543 --> 00:53:07,120
We're just gonna give it to
the ranger, if you don't care.

782
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,900
Look, we're armed to the teeth.

783
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,860
Just drop the camera bag, walk away.

784
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:16,509
We don't want anything to
happen to you or your girl.

785
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:48,990
- There's only two ways out of here.

786
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:51,933
We're going that way.

787
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:59,480
I better never ever see you again.

788
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:06,370
Okay. It's official.

789
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:10,000
Those guys are creepier than
an elevator full of furies.

790
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,400
- Let's just get our
stuff and get out of here.

791
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,860
- Wait. I didn't know...

792
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:16,220
Robin, this is the fucking
thing I was talking about.

793
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,580
The rednecks, hillbilly-

794
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,743
- They're not rednecks.

795
00:54:18,743 --> 00:54:20,730
- What do you mean?

796
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:22,253
- They had non-slip shoes on.

797
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,120
- What the hell does that...?

798
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,160
I didn't notice their shoes.

799
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,991
I was looking at a nine-foot
machete in my face.

800
00:54:26,991 --> 00:54:28,540
- I was waitress for eight years.

801
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:31,100
- So, you're saying rednecks
can't work in a restaurant?

802
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,503
- I only heard one of them
speak with a Southern accent.

803
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,300
- I don't care if they're the
bodyguards of Jesus Christ.

804
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,198
I'm not-

805
00:54:38,198 --> 00:54:39,031
- Let's just get our stuff and go.

806
00:54:39,031 --> 00:54:39,864
- All right.

807
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:45,653
- Hey do you want this?

808
00:54:49,426 --> 00:54:51,020
- I don't want to see that, man.

809
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,594
- Here, you take it.

810
00:54:53,594 --> 00:54:54,927
I don't want it.

811
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:01,900
- Robin, baby, stop.

812
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:03,905
I don't know what to do, man.

813
00:55:04,738 --> 00:55:05,930
I don't know what to freaking do.

814
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:07,882
These guys could be
following us right now.

815
00:55:07,882 --> 00:55:08,715
- Yeah.

816
00:55:08,715 --> 00:55:11,160
I know you've been saying
it for three hours.

817
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:11,993
- What?

818
00:55:11,993 --> 00:55:13,020
Am I supposed to kick three guys' ass

819
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,480
with machetes this freaking long?

820
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,900
- We can focus on the problem,

821
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,690
or we can focus on a solution.

822
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:18,523
There's just something

823
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,140
that the giant said that stuck with me.

824
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:21,120
- What is it?

825
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,510
- He said something about
trees, falling on people,

826
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:24,680
and rock slides.

827
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:25,680
- And?

828
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,100
- Well, do you remember
the story I told you,

829
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,500
that my grandfather told me?

830
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,730
- About the rock scrotum?

831
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,163
- About the rock golem.

832
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:34,883
- Robin, baby, we ain't got time

833
00:55:34,883 --> 00:55:36,500
to deal with his bullshit, man.

834
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,083
I'm gonna kick three
motherfucking men's ass.

835
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:51,953
- Really?

836
00:55:51,953 --> 00:55:52,800
Got the flashlight on

837
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,220
in the middle of the day, Travis?

838
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,053
- And it's fine.

839
00:55:56,053 --> 00:55:58,243
I'll just go down to the ranger
station and charge it later.

840
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:02,990
Hey man, you know what I miss?

841
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:03,823
- What?

842
00:56:03,823 --> 00:56:05,123
- Air conditioning.

843
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:07,820
- Hey, you know what
we'll be doing right now,

844
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,360
if we're back in the real world?

845
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,193
- Hmm?

846
00:56:10,193 --> 00:56:12,784
- I'd be telling your dumb
ass, to roll some silverware.

847
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,490
- I still wouldn't do it.

848
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:18,680
- Man, day shift 60, night shifts 75.

849
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,849
Get it done, son.

850
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:26,360
Did you look at the camera?

851
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,513
- Yeah.

852
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:39,150
As your friend, you don't need to see it.

853
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:40,283
- I have to know.

854
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:45,143
- Let's just go get those fuckers, man.

855
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:47,713
- Was it her?

856
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,593
- Yeah.

857
00:56:58,870 --> 00:56:59,703
Seriously, man.

858
00:56:59,703 --> 00:57:02,323
Let's just go get those
motherfuckers right now.

859
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:05,193
- It's fucking on.

860
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,327
Wait where the fuck is Scott?

861
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:12,850
- I thought he was with you.

862
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:13,823
- Shit.

863
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:25,893
- Beer.

864
00:57:45,439 --> 00:57:47,022
- You didn't drink.

865
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:49,200
- My nerves are shot.

866
00:57:53,193 --> 00:57:55,800
- Do you think these beers
belong to those guys back there?

867
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,650
- God, I hope so.

868
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:58,343
- Why?

869
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:03,374
- Because rednecks don't need more beer.

870
00:58:06,028 --> 00:58:07,747
Did you hear that?

871
00:58:07,747 --> 00:58:09,100
I think that's him.

872
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,100
We gotta go.

873
00:58:26,303 --> 00:58:28,030
- What the hell are you doing?

874
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:30,620
My brother escaped a bear
attack doing this once.

875
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:31,720
Just trust me.

876
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,100
He called this making a dummy of a dummy.

877
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,690
He's got them bad jokes.

878
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:38,300
All right.

879
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:41,290
That should slow them
down and confuse them.

880
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:42,123
Let's go.

881
00:58:56,889 --> 00:59:01,889
- What the fuck is this?

882
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,320
This is his clothes?

883
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,153
- Right.

884
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:08,733
- There is something in the pocket.

885
00:59:09,657 --> 00:59:12,453
- No, no, no, no.

886
00:59:21,645 --> 00:59:23,478
We are gonna kill you.

887
00:59:37,749 --> 00:59:38,582
- Hey, what are you doing?

888
00:59:38,582 --> 00:59:39,415
We got to keep moving.

889
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,085
Hey baby. What's wrong?

890
00:59:42,085 --> 00:59:44,010
- Oh my God! They're gonna kill us.

891
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:44,843
- Hey. Hey.

892
00:59:45,969 --> 00:59:47,940
Hey, babe. I got this.

893
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:50,170
Listen. Sweetheart, look at me.

894
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:51,653
Look at me, Robin.

895
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:54,457
I got this baby.

896
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:56,744
?

897
00:59:56,744 --> 00:59:58,897
I'm gonna isolate him, okay?

898
00:59:58,897 --> 01:00:01,880
I'm gonna hit him with one left hand,

899
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,900
and then two right hands.

900
01:00:04,733 --> 01:00:05,566
And then it's going to be on.

901
01:00:05,566 --> 01:00:07,203
- Please stay out of it.

902
01:00:08,303 --> 01:00:10,740
And I'm gonna reap his face a part.

903
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:12,070
He won't know what's up.

904
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:14,967
And then I'm gonna bite
him on that fathead of his.

905
01:00:14,967 --> 01:00:15,800
And then it's gonna be the time

906
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,063
to call bigy and the ball guards, baby.

907
01:00:18,063 --> 01:00:20,182
'Cause I'm gonna get him under the chin,

908
01:00:20,182 --> 01:00:21,939
and draw him on his bad ass.

909
01:00:21,939 --> 01:00:25,439
And then I'm gonna put him in figure four.

910
01:00:31,438 --> 01:00:32,745
I'm gonna break your leg.

911
01:00:32,745 --> 01:00:34,501
I'm gonna break your damn leg.

912
01:00:34,501 --> 01:00:36,029
You son of a bitch.

913
01:00:36,029 --> 01:00:37,173
And then the big guy is gonna see

914
01:00:37,173 --> 01:00:39,320
what I'm doing with the other guy.

915
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,807
And he's gonna say,

916
01:00:40,807 --> 01:00:44,227
"Not the figure four, I
don't want any of that."

917
01:00:44,227 --> 01:00:46,950
And he's gonna run away like a bitch.

918
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:47,783
Okay?

919
01:00:47,783 --> 01:00:49,336
We're always save.

920
01:00:49,336 --> 01:00:50,169
Everything's gonna be okay,

921
01:00:50,169 --> 01:00:51,002
but we gotta start moving.

922
01:00:51,002 --> 01:00:52,933
We gotta start moving now, okay?

923
01:00:52,933 --> 01:00:54,433
All right, baby. Get your bag.

924
01:00:56,102 --> 01:00:57,040
There we go.

925
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:57,873
We can make it.

926
01:00:57,873 --> 01:00:58,770
We're almost there.

927
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:02,380
Everything's gonna be okay.

928
01:01:06,466 --> 01:01:07,299
Run!

929
01:01:17,562 --> 01:01:18,395
- Shit.

930
01:01:20,737 --> 01:01:22,570
- I think we lost him.

931
01:01:26,369 --> 01:01:28,762
- Looks like he's going the wrong way.

932
01:01:45,951 --> 01:01:49,951
over here.

933
01:02:09,886 --> 01:02:13,573
like five minutes.

934
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,183
So, we're gonna have to kill them.

935
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:23,783
I mean, yeah, we have to.

936
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,330
I can't believe they got Scott.

937
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:29,203
Yeah. Her too?

938
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,570
I think she's
more dangerous than he is.

939
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:33,403
Yeah.

940
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:39,700
They could have turned off at the Canyon.

941
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:42,483
Man, if they hit
that Canyon, and they're gone.

942
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,277
There're caves on there.

943
01:02:53,303 --> 01:02:54,980
I don't do caves.

944
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:57,613
Tight spaces, bad shape.

945
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,687
And I don't like caves at all.

946
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:08,740
We could probably head
them up the .

947
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:14,653
I'm gonna head down to the cave.

948
01:03:16,784 --> 01:03:17,617
- What the fuck.

949
01:03:17,617 --> 01:03:18,530
- That's gotta be them.

950
01:03:33,548 --> 01:03:34,631
- Go, go, go.

951
01:03:39,514 --> 01:03:40,347
Let's go.

952
01:03:51,742 --> 01:03:53,199
- Hey, look. There's another Polaroid.

953
01:04:05,916 --> 01:04:07,381
Let's go hiding in here.

954
01:04:07,381 --> 01:04:08,840
- Sure.

955
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:16,393
No.

956
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:26,000
Man, we are
just walking in circles.

957
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,673
Man, this sucks.

958
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:31,550
- Oh, here's that Canyon
he was talking about.

959
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:33,050
They'll never find us in here.

960
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:46,950
- Which way back?

961
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:47,783
Do you remember?

962
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:49,940
- I think we go that way.

963
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,060
- Robin, wait, wait.

964
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:32,636
A big red dick.

965
01:06:04,691 --> 01:06:07,217
What the fuck is that?

966
01:06:12,649 --> 01:06:14,482
Come one. We gotta go.

967
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:25,112
What the fuck!

968
01:06:25,112 --> 01:06:26,030
- Oh, my God!

969
01:06:26,030 --> 01:06:27,277
- Is that the same dick?

970
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,373
This can't be the same dick.

971
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:33,370
- We're moving around in circles.

972
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:34,630
This cave is a straight line.

973
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:35,933
It doesn't make any sense.

974
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:39,820
- What the fuck do we do?

975
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:41,160
Which way do we go?

976
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,740
There's not been one turnover.

977
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:45,353
How are we in a fucking
circle over and over again?

978
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,033
Okay.

979
01:06:50,033 --> 01:06:52,510
We've been walking through
what feels like endless.

980
01:06:53,517 --> 01:06:55,803
This is flash drier spot.

981
01:06:58,650 --> 01:06:59,703
- I don't care.

982
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,500
Looks great.

983
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:04,800
- I lost the fucking tent.

984
01:07:06,281 --> 01:07:08,181
It's all we have is the sleeping bags.

985
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,480
Well, we've been running a mile, huh?

986
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:12,313
- I don't care.

987
01:07:12,313 --> 01:07:14,053
Let's just lay down, lay in it.

988
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:23,283
I ruined my brand new shoes.

989
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:29,743
- You know, one of us is
gonna have to stay awake.

990
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:34,580
- It's so quiet in here, man.

991
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:36,230
We'll wake up if we hear anybody.

992
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:39,090
- I can't sleep in the silence.

993
01:07:39,090 --> 01:07:40,980
So, why not just maybe...

994
01:07:42,990 --> 01:07:43,823
- Good luck.

995
01:07:43,823 --> 01:07:45,210
You know what happened last time?

996
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:51,963
I love you, Robin.

997
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:55,594
- I know you think you do.

998
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:59,990
- Even through all this stupid shit,

999
01:07:59,990 --> 01:08:02,750
if we live through the night...

1000
01:08:05,370 --> 01:08:07,170
This has actually been a lot of fun.

1001
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:12,390
It hasn't been fun, but you
know what I'm trying to say.

1002
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:14,790
I'm glad if I had to
do this shit with you,

1003
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:15,890
let's put it that way.

1004
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,153
- Me too.

1005
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,407
- All right.
- Good night.

1006
01:08:25,325 --> 01:08:26,908
- Good night, baby.

1007
01:08:48,306 --> 01:08:49,223
Sweetheart.

1008
01:08:52,521 --> 01:08:54,104
What are you doing?

1009
01:09:03,517 --> 01:09:04,350
Oh my God.

1010
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:07,425
You're beautiful.

1011
01:09:10,735 --> 01:09:11,902
So, beautiful.

1012
01:09:14,304 --> 01:09:15,887
What are you doing?

1013
01:09:26,763 --> 01:09:28,634
What's going on?

1014
01:09:28,634 --> 01:09:29,467
Come here.

1015
01:09:30,841 --> 01:09:33,258
Where are you going? Come on.

1016
01:09:38,229 --> 01:09:40,146
What's gotten into you?

1017
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:44,083
Okay. Where are you going? Come here.

1018
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:46,243
Let me touch it.

1019
01:09:48,030 --> 01:09:48,880
You look so good.

1020
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:50,940
What are you doing?

1021
01:09:53,099 --> 01:09:54,349
What has gotten into you.

1022
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:57,783
I like it, but it's weird.

1023
01:09:59,475 --> 01:10:00,308
All right.

1024
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:02,447
You look good.

1025
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:07,970
Where the fuck did you go?

1026
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:08,803
Robin.

1027
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:14,533
Robin.

1028
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:21,553
Where'd you go, baby?

1029
01:10:23,767 --> 01:10:25,243
Did you find the way out?

1030
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:30,793
Robin.

1031
01:10:36,571 --> 01:10:37,654
Did you fall?

1032
01:10:39,848 --> 01:10:40,765
Sweetheart.

1033
01:10:46,662 --> 01:10:47,495
Baby.

1034
01:10:54,915 --> 01:10:56,415
Thank God! Lights.

1035
01:11:07,771 --> 01:11:08,604
Robin.

1036
01:11:18,962 --> 01:11:19,795
Robin.

1037
01:11:32,449 --> 01:11:33,282
Robin.

1038
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:44,800
Robin, sweetheart.

1039
01:11:49,193 --> 01:11:52,526
How the hell am I gonna get out of this?

1040
01:11:54,137 --> 01:11:54,970
Robin.

1041
01:12:08,345 --> 01:12:09,178
- Vinnie.

1042
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:13,261
Vinnie.

1043
01:12:18,627 --> 01:12:21,294
Oh, my God! Where's the lighter?

1044
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:28,833
Vinnie.

1045
01:12:35,581 --> 01:12:36,414
Vinnie.

1046
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:43,323
Vinnie, this is not funny.

1047
01:12:47,014 --> 01:12:49,930
Vinnie.

1048
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:50,763
Vinnie.

1049
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:55,753
This is not funny.

1050
01:13:09,067 --> 01:13:09,900
Hello.

1051
01:13:51,121 --> 01:13:51,967
- Robin.

1052
01:13:57,652 --> 01:14:00,311
- I know that's not you.

1053
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:03,978
- Robin.

1054
01:14:07,263 --> 01:14:09,430
Come to daddy. Stupid bitch.

1055
01:14:24,930 --> 01:14:26,180
- Fuck! Oh, no.

1056
01:14:50,733 --> 01:14:51,566
Vinnie.

1057
01:14:53,371 --> 01:14:54,288
I found it.

1058
01:14:56,203 --> 01:14:58,490
I Found the way out.

1059
01:14:58,490 --> 01:14:59,990
Oh my God. Vinnie.

1060
01:15:09,653 --> 01:15:11,990
Vinnie, wake up.

1061
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:15,009
Vinnie, Vinnie.

1062
01:15:15,009 --> 01:15:17,009
Vinnie, wake up. Vinnie.

1063
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:22,140
You son of a bitch, you
took the flashlight.

1064
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,360
Where have you been?

1065
01:15:32,063 --> 01:15:34,960
- I don't know. Help me up.

1066
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,094
What happened?

1067
01:15:39,094 --> 01:15:40,344
- I don't know.

1068
01:15:45,037 --> 01:15:46,530
Now we found the exit,

1069
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:48,253
but how are we gonna get through it?

1070
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:53,363
There's another exit.

1071
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,593
It's just around this way.

1072
01:16:20,113 --> 01:16:22,921
The town should be half a mile this way.

1073
01:16:22,921 --> 01:16:23,754
Come on.

1074
01:16:23,754 --> 01:16:25,837
- Okay. You lead the way.

1075
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:41,876
You wouldn't have a
tail on you, would you?

1076
01:16:41,876 --> 01:16:43,343
- No.

1077
01:16:43,343 --> 01:16:44,208
- You know we travel a lot.

1078
01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:11,620
- Oh my God, it's a road.

1079
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:13,020
I think we're close to town.

1080
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:15,760
- Good, because I'm about to pass out.

1081
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:25,933
- Let's go.

1082
01:17:27,414 --> 01:17:28,957
- No baby.

1083
01:17:28,957 --> 01:17:30,093
This ends here.

1084
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:31,973
No more running.

1085
01:17:33,467 --> 01:17:34,300
- You can't, Vinnie.

1086
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:35,133
He's a giant.

1087
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:39,673
- Baby, I'm Baltimore bad.

1088
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:44,503
- I love you.

1089
01:17:46,530 --> 01:17:47,830
- I know you think you do.

1090
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:52,490
- Kick his ass.

1091
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,742
Com on, Vinnie.

1092
01:19:45,742 --> 01:19:47,825
- This ends when you die.

1093
01:19:52,364 --> 01:19:53,432
Move Vinnie.

1094
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:03,616
Get him, babe.

1095
01:20:33,555 --> 01:20:34,536
Get up, Vinnie.

1096
01:20:34,536 --> 01:20:35,369
Get up.

1097
01:21:17,846 --> 01:21:20,846
- You stay with me through the shit.

1098
01:21:38,274 --> 01:21:39,653
No!

1099
01:22:05,949 --> 01:22:08,366
- No! Please, don't kill him.

1100
01:23:23,522 --> 01:23:25,292
- I'm coming for you.

1101
01:23:27,950 --> 01:23:29,490
in the woods, messing
with me and my girlfriend.

1102
01:23:29,490 --> 01:23:30,940
What's wrong with you people?

1103
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:33,520
Come on!

1104
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,667
I took out your giant,
I'll take out you next.

1105
01:23:35,667 --> 01:23:36,500
- Vinnie!

1106
01:23:38,184 --> 01:23:39,101
No! Vinnie.

1107
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,630
Oh, my God! No!

1108
01:24:09,930 --> 01:24:11,013
Motherfucker.

1109
01:24:18,591 --> 01:24:20,091
You, motherfucker.

1110
01:24:29,445 --> 01:24:30,278
Vinnie!

1111
01:24:31,272 --> 01:24:32,105
Vinnie!

1112
01:24:46,717 --> 01:24:47,550
Vinnie!

1113
01:24:50,202 --> 01:24:51,035
No.

1114
01:24:53,249 --> 01:24:54,082
Vinnie!

1115
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:54,833
- At least we stopped you.

1116
01:25:56,073 --> 01:25:57,433
You can't kill anyone else.

1117
01:26:00,208 --> 01:26:01,041
- What?

1118
01:26:02,963 --> 01:26:05,520
- You had his daughter's camera bag,

1119
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:08,853
and we found the Polaroids.

1120
01:26:15,185 --> 01:26:17,673
- No, we didn't.

1121
01:27:02,271 --> 01:27:03,300
- Where the hell did you get that?

1122
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:05,250
- I found it down the river earlier.

1123
01:27:05,250 --> 01:27:07,610
- Oh, I thought it was
one of the Indian things.

1124
01:27:07,610 --> 01:27:08,483
- Such a dick.

1125
01:27:39,646 --> 01:27:41,813
- I told you we'd get out.

1126
01:32:05,730 --> 01:32:06,898
- I'm falling down!

1127
01:32:06,898 --> 01:32:07,731
Oh!
