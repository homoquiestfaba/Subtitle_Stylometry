CALVIN: Gus Delario--
the invisible man is Gus.

2
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:24,891
He's one of those guys...

3
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:27,560
who you feel like
you know them really well...

4
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,562
but when
you think about it...

5
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:31,731
you don't really know them
at all, you know what I mean?

6
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:33,566
And, you know, obviously...

7
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:35,568
you look at his track record
of all the movies he's done--

8
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,904
He's been very successful.
Almost every actor in town...

9
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:41,840
wants to work in, you know,
one of Gus's movies.

10
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:46,579
FRANCESCA: I've done
some mean things in my life.

11
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:51,551
Yeah. And sometimes,
the--ahem, ahem--

12
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,753
the worst part is
is that sometimes...

13
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:55,522
it doesn't bother me.

14
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,457
I just say, well,
yeah, this is mean.

15
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,193
I wanted to be mean,
and I was mean.

16
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:01,888
Period.

17
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,933
LEE: Well, I have to be
somewhat judgmental...

18
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,302
because of what I do,
you know...

19
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:11,171
so I don 't think
that it's such a bad thing...

20
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,106
to be judgmental.

21
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:17,010
I think that's
how you get through life.

22
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,845
You have to assess things...

23
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:22,549
and people do it
about you all the time...

24
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,484
and that's life,
and it's too bad.

25
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,223
CARL: I think there is
no amount of money...

26
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,058
I could have been paid--

27
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:34,094
there is no deal
that I could have made...

28
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:38,198
that she would not have felt
that I had been too passive...

29
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,934
and that--I think that...

30
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,636
her opinion of me
on that level...

31
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:47,073
was formed before
the movie was ever sold.

32
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:50,065
I think it has nothing to do
with the movie, frankly.

33
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,681
ARTHUR: It's frightening.
It's monstrous.

34
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,117
It's evil
to not have feelings.

35
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,752
So I spoke to Carl about it,
and we discussed it...

36
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,855
and we went immediately...

37
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,389
to the most monstrous
character...

38
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:04,991
we could think of in history--

LINDA: Yeah, they're always
trying to set me up...

41
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:11,731
Lee and Carl. They--

42
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,867
Well, they never have
introduced me to anyone...

43
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,536
but they always talk about
how I should be dating.

44
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,538
But they're
trying to set me up now...

45
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:23,042
with this producer friend
of theirs--a guy named Gus.

46
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:27,013
Uh... we'll see.
I don 't think...

47
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:30,312
a film producer's going to go
for me, but I don 't know.

-I'm good, How are you?

No, I'm his flunky,,,

you want me to write?

No,
No, you can write "sidekick,"

So, no,

I don't have a problem with it,

Look, if I'm going to make
the leap to the big screen,,,

67
00:05:06,271 --> 00:05:08,407
I expect to work for it,

expect to have to work
to make that leap?

where I can't continue
in this marriage.

was that every day
I would go into work,,,

I'm too committed to my work,,,

346
00:19:56,693 --> 00:19:59,529
to sustain a serious
relationship right now,

347
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:03,299
You know, I bring work
home with me, I'm distracted,

348
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:06,736
I'm taking a swim in Lake Me,
you know?

349
00:20:06,736 --> 00:20:10,940
And, you--hey, you deserve
better, believe you me,

350
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,309
I would only cause you pain,

351
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:16,045
Remember how I let you
twirl my key chain?

352
00:20:16,045 --> 00:20:20,416
Nice, right?
Hugging, kissing, all nice,

353
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:23,544
Now, go on, sweetie,
Go on, split, Come on, come on,

354
00:20:24,887 --> 00:20:26,354
I'll call you,

355
00:20:32,228 --> 00:20:35,098
If the phone doesn't ring,
it's probably me,

356
00:20:35,098 --> 00:20:36,866
[Sighing] Oh, man,

357

"Gone to get haircut,"

360
00:20:48,578 --> 00:20:50,569
What an asshole,

361
00:20:52,582 --> 00:20:54,584
LINDA: I don't know why,
I just started that.

362
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:57,086
I don't--I just don't want
them knowing me, you know?

363
00:20:57,086 --> 00:20:58,755
I don't want them knowing me.

364
00:20:58,755 --> 00:21:03,426
I give--I give the name "Ann"
all the time...

365
00:21:03,426 --> 00:21:05,027
because it seems like Ann is--

366
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:06,529
One,

367
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:09,198
And it's less invasive.

368
00:21:09,198 --> 00:21:11,701
It's less--
or more anonymous, you know?

369
00:21:11,701 --> 00:21:13,703
More invisible.
If they know me as Ann...

370
00:21:13,703 --> 00:21:16,035
they don't know who really
is in the room with them.

371
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,704
And for some reason,
that feels good to me.

-Yes,

-It's kind of personal,
-Shoot,

389
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,456
Is that your real hair?

390
00:23:13,456 --> 00:23:14,980
Absolutely.

391
00:23:16,492 --> 00:23:19,528
Hmm, I'm thinking of
getting some more,

392
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:21,664
Don't do that.

-Why not?
-You'll have doll head,

394

I don't care, I want more hair,

Low-level, free-floating
anxiety about it, you know?

396
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:34,543
I have anxiety about it,

397
00:23:34,543 --> 00:23:36,712
I see homeless guys
with a full head of hair,,,

398
00:23:36,712 --> 00:23:38,280

what the fuck--

00:23:41,317 --> 00:23:42,750

Uh, she says no,

00:23:46,288 --> 00:23:48,157
Well, that's a lie,

403
00:23:48,157 --> 00:23:51,594
She doesn't say anything,
and I assume that's a no,

to "and"s, See what happens,

-No,

00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:22,711
That Holiday lnn part--
that's kind of a little sad,

460
00:26:22,711 --> 00:26:25,147
-Why is that sad?
-Because, Tucson?

461
00:26:25,147 --> 00:26:28,017
-So what? He knows a good one,
-All right,

462
00:26:28,017 --> 00:26:30,052

a lot of thought into this,

-Kind of like a wedding?
-Sort of,

OK, I think that was good,
but I really, really think,,,

you guys shouldn't make
eye contact,

I'm giving my all, and
I'm really fucking worried, OK?

483
00:27:09,692 --> 00:27:11,494
Because last week you tell me,,,

484
00:27:11,494 --> 00:27:13,429
you want me to play it
like Danny Kaye, right?

485

you come in, and you say,,,

486
00:27:15,097 --> 00:27:16,899
"Hey, why don't you play it
like Alan Alda,"

487
00:27:16,899 --> 00:27:18,434
What am l, fucking Danny Alda?

488
00:27:18,434 --> 00:27:20,002
OK, I think

you're really distracted,

This is art,

the day we started rehearsals,

494

You're not here, man,

You're not present,

495

I am here, I am here,

496
00:27:34,483 --> 00:27:37,319
You're not, OK?

And I'm starting to question,,,

497
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:39,655
whether you and Carl know what
the fuck you're talking about,

498
00:27:39,655 --> 00:27:40,823
Because let me tell you
something,,,

499

Peter Ustinov said,

"To act is difficult,,,

500
00:27:43,392 --> 00:27:45,928
"but it's more difficult
to write a bad play,,,

"than to give
a bad performance,"

You know what? You know what?

503
00:27:50,532 --> 00:27:53,067
What a great fucking idea,
watching me squirm,

504
00:27:53,067 --> 00:27:55,136
What are you talking about?

505
00:27:55,136 --> 00:27:59,240
-Catherine,
-What are you talking about?

506
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,342
-The letter,
-What letter?

507
00:28:01,342 --> 00:28:03,435
Uh, the letter,

508

-May l?
-Oh, yeah,

509
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:13,214
You're acting crazy,

510
00:28:17,025 --> 00:28:18,356
Hmm,

511
00:28:20,528 --> 00:28:22,462
Wow, Well,

512
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,936
Pretty extraordinary,

513
00:28:27,936 --> 00:28:29,904
Really?

514
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:35,543
This is a prank, right?

515
00:28:35,543 --> 00:28:38,046
I mean, that's cool,

You can tell me,

516
00:28:38,046 --> 00:28:40,048
I don't think it's a prank, no,

517
00:28:40,048 --> 00:28:41,849
You didn't write this?

518
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:44,385
Is it your fantasy
that I wrote it?

519
00:28:44,385 --> 00:28:46,054
Oh, don't, Don't do that,

520
00:28:46,054 --> 00:28:47,722
I don't know what to tell you,

521
00:28:47,722 --> 00:28:49,223
OK, here's the deal,

522
00:28:49,223 --> 00:28:51,492
This right here,
you can't write about,

523
00:28:51,492 --> 00:28:53,928
-I can't?
-No, you cannot, It's not fair,

524
00:28:53,928 --> 00:28:55,229
You know, they really do
have ovens back there,

525
00:28:55,229 --> 00:28:57,131
I am onto you, girl,

526
00:28:57,131 --> 00:28:59,233
Well, I think I'm onto you,
all right?

527
00:28:59,233 --> 00:29:01,369
Look at me,

528
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:03,894
-Look at me,
-Oh, my,

529
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,232
Come on,

did you write the letter?

530
00:29:11,713 --> 00:29:13,010
It's OK,

531
00:29:17,518 --> 00:29:18,678
See?

532
00:29:20,955 --> 00:29:24,892
Ahem, I'm just not gonna play
this game with you anymore,

533
00:29:24,892 --> 00:29:27,452
I ain't even thinking about you,
Look,

534
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:38,706
You missed a piece,

535
00:29:38,706 --> 00:29:40,765
[Sighs]

536
00:29:42,944 --> 00:29:46,647
CARL: So, Tracy--
is that your given name?

537
00:29:46,647 --> 00:29:48,416
-Yes,
-Mm-hmm,

538
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,519
And what's your porn name?

539
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:52,687
I'm--

540
00:29:52,687 --> 00:29:54,488
Do you know about porn names?

541
00:29:54,488 --> 00:29:55,723
-No,
-OK,

542
00:29:55,723 --> 00:29:57,692
Your porn name
is your middle name...

543
00:29:57,692 --> 00:30:02,363
and the name of the first
street you grew up on.

544
00:30:02,363 --> 00:30:03,531
OK,

545
00:30:03,531 --> 00:30:07,168
So, like, my porn name
is Andrew Highland.

546
00:30:07,168 --> 00:30:10,471
[Laughs] It's terrible.
It's not very sexy.

547
00:30:10,471 --> 00:30:13,174
So, you're Tracy...

548
00:30:13,174 --> 00:30:15,443
I don't have a middle name,

549
00:30:15,443 --> 00:30:16,911
Oh, well, you can--

550
00:30:16,911 --> 00:30:21,782
Yeah, well, you can also use
the name of your first pet.

551
00:30:21,782 --> 00:30:25,252
We weren't allowed to have pets,

552
00:30:25,252 --> 00:30:27,855
Ivory Coast, Senegal,
Sierra Leone,,,

553
00:30:27,855 --> 00:30:29,190
LEE: Mm-hmm. Good.

554
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:31,993
Ghana, Mali,

555
00:30:31,993 --> 00:30:34,662
Have you ever--been tested
lately for the H,l,V, virus?

556
00:30:34,662 --> 00:30:39,000
No, Yes,
Morocco, Mozambique, Angola,,,

557
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,668
Good, My goodness,

558
00:30:40,668 --> 00:30:42,303
-Cameroon,,,
-Stay there,

559
00:30:42,303 --> 00:30:44,672
-Congo,,,
-God, you are good,

560
00:30:44,672 --> 00:30:46,374
Gabon, Angola,

561
00:30:46,374 --> 00:30:49,510
-Go east,
-Kenya, Somalia Republic,,,

562
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,178
-Jesus,
-Ethiopia,

563
00:30:51,178 --> 00:30:54,511
Time,
You are very impressive,

564
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:59,086
I don't think
you're allowed to do this,

565
00:30:59,086 --> 00:31:01,188
[Takes polaroid]

566
00:31:01,188 --> 00:31:02,790
Of course I am.

567
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:05,020
Get down from there.

568
00:31:06,494 --> 00:31:09,163
LEE: Just meet me
in the lobby, please.

569
00:31:09,163 --> 00:31:12,099
You'll have a great time.
I know you'll love Gus.

570
00:31:12,099 --> 00:31:14,301
I can't go to a party like that,
I have nothing to wear,

571
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:16,904
LEE: Wear the green dress.
You look great in it.

572
00:31:16,904 --> 00:31:18,873
It's too tight,
It doesn't fit me anymore,,,

573
00:31:18,873 --> 00:31:20,041
and it has a stain that's--

574
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:21,308
LEE:
You always have an excuse.

575
00:31:21,308 --> 00:31:22,910
It's not an excuse,
Lee, that's a reason,

576
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,245
There's a difference,

577
00:31:24,245 --> 00:31:25,646
Look, are we still

having lunch today?

578
00:31:25,646 --> 00:31:28,516
Because I have
a birthday present for you,

579
00:31:28,516 --> 00:31:30,551
LEE: It's tomorrow.

580
00:31:30,551 --> 00:31:33,087
You know what? I know
when your birthday is, OK?

581
00:31:33,087 --> 00:31:34,889
I'm not here tomorrow,

582
00:31:34,889 --> 00:31:36,724
LEE: Hey, Linda...

583
00:31:36,724 --> 00:31:38,559
Hello?

584
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,227
LEE: You're breaking up.
Call me back.

585
00:31:40,227 --> 00:31:42,596
Hello? Listen, if you can
hear me, call me back,

586
00:31:42,596 --> 00:31:44,598
LEE: Call me back.

587
00:31:44,598 --> 00:31:46,901
[Hangs up]
Fuck,

588
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:48,736
LINDA:
Yeah, I think about him a lot.

589
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:53,641
You know? It's hard.
I found him in the basement.

590
00:31:53,641 --> 00:31:57,044
And then I found Lee...

591
00:31:57,044 --> 00:31:59,280
who was outside, I think,
or somewhere else in the house.

592
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,481
I mean, I remember screaming...

593
00:32:00,481 --> 00:32:03,017
and then I remember her
appearing.

594
00:32:03,017 --> 00:32:06,153
Uh, and then, you know,
no one else was home...

595
00:32:06,153 --> 00:32:09,924
so she ran to a neighbor's...

596
00:32:09,924 --> 00:32:14,228
and, uh, I stayed with him.

597
00:32:14,228 --> 00:32:18,165
And then neighbors came, and...

598
00:32:18,165 --> 00:32:19,633
and then my mom was home.

599
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:23,034
They found my mom, and so...

600
00:32:25,139 --> 00:32:26,640
LEE:
It's pretty surprising...

601
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,010
when you see
somebody you know...

602
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:34,315
Iike your dad, you know,
in that state, you know?

603
00:32:34,315 --> 00:32:35,816
So, it was surprising...

604
00:32:35,816 --> 00:32:41,049
but I think that, you know,
in retrospect, he...

605
00:32:42,423 --> 00:32:44,525
[Groaning]

606
00:32:44,525 --> 00:32:48,696
He was pretty unhappy...

607
00:32:48,696 --> 00:32:51,062
most of the time.

608
00:32:52,099 --> 00:32:55,402
My friend Gus says that people--
the straight world--

609
00:32:55,402 --> 00:32:58,339
will always be fascinated
by gangster sagas,,,

610
00:32:58,339 --> 00:33:00,574
because, here are these guys,,,

611
00:33:00,574 --> 00:33:02,676
they say,
"We're not going to live,,,

612
00:33:02,676 --> 00:33:04,078
"by some unspoken rule,,,

613
00:33:04,078 --> 00:33:05,513
"that we don't take you
to the cleaners,,,

614
00:33:05,513 --> 00:33:06,680
"when you're not looking,

615
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,417
"We don't have any agreement
not to take advantage of you,"

616
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:12,753
And these people, they're
in the minority, fortunately,,,

617
00:33:12,753 --> 00:33:14,488
otherwise, there would be chaos,

618
00:33:14,488 --> 00:33:20,594
But we love watching them,
because--because,,,

619
00:33:20,594 --> 00:33:22,863
it's a walk on the wild side,,,

620
00:33:22,863 --> 00:33:25,232
without any real risk
of corruption,

621
00:33:25,232 --> 00:33:26,834
It's two-dimensional, you know?

622
00:33:26,834 --> 00:33:28,469
And it's always
going to be compelling,

623
00:33:28,469 --> 00:33:31,939
Uh, you know, sometimes,
we can't look away,

624
00:33:31,939 --> 00:33:33,941
But--and we should,

625
00:33:33,941 --> 00:33:35,142
[Door opens]

626
00:33:35,142 --> 00:33:38,145
-Hey, Carl, how you doing, pal?
-Good to see you,

627
00:33:38,145 --> 00:33:41,048
-You look great,
-Thanks, Uh,,,

628
00:33:41,048 --> 00:33:43,350
you know, that's amazing
that you called today,,,

629
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,920
because l--ahem--
I needed to see you,

630
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,412
I have an idea, I have an idea,
I think it's a cover,

631
00:34:03,637 --> 00:34:05,406
You got slobber
all up on your,,,

632
00:34:05,406 --> 00:34:06,998
Mmm,

633
00:34:08,175 --> 00:34:10,911
What time is it?

634
00:34:10,911 --> 00:34:13,314
Oh, I feel--I feel nauseous,

635
00:34:13,314 --> 00:34:15,816
Are you ready to talk
about this?

636
00:34:15,816 --> 00:34:19,453
Ohh, Nicholas,,,

637
00:34:19,453 --> 00:34:22,022
Iook, I think

that you're very talented,,,

638
00:34:22,022 --> 00:34:25,693
and I'll probably write
a very nice piece about you,,,

639
00:34:25,693 --> 00:34:28,896
but you're really annoying
about this whole letter thing,

640
00:34:28,896 --> 00:34:32,466
No, You're annoying,

641
00:34:32,466 --> 00:34:35,569
Mm-hmm, OK,

642
00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:39,340
CARL: You see, I think that is
worth discussing. I really do.

643
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,610
Well, Carl, I'll discuss

anything with you anytime,,,

644
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:45,145
because every time
you've come into my office,,,

645
00:34:45,145 --> 00:34:47,481
every time
I've asked to see you,,,

646
00:34:47,481 --> 00:34:49,883
or you've come to see me
with an idea,,,

647
00:34:49,883 --> 00:34:51,652
about a cover
or a feature story,,,

648
00:34:51,652 --> 00:34:53,220
or anything you want to do,,,

649
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,290
it always has validity,
It always has,,,

650
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,959
it's important to me
to hear your ideas, you know?

651
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:00,127
Thank you, thank you.

652
00:35:00,127 --> 00:35:01,629
Let me ask you a question.

653
00:35:01,629 --> 00:35:03,397
The reason I called you in
today, actually...

654
00:35:03,397 --> 00:35:05,399
Yeah, Sorry, Ahem,

655
00:35:05,399 --> 00:35:06,734
I have a question for you...

656
00:35:06,734 --> 00:35:10,971
and it's kind of important
to me to hear the answer,

657
00:35:10,971 --> 00:35:12,506
And the question is,,,

658
00:35:12,506 --> 00:35:16,210
when you go to your
refrigerator in your home,,,

659
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:20,080
and you open the door,
and you see a bottle of beer,,,

660
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,949
do you take
that bottle of beer,,,

661
00:35:21,949 --> 00:35:24,151
and pour it into a glass
and drink it,,,

662
00:35:24,151 --> 00:35:26,517
or do you drink it
from the bottle?

663
00:35:29,156 --> 00:35:34,361
Um, I--I--
well, I drink it from a glass.

664
00:35:34,361 --> 00:35:36,330
Ah, you see?

665
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:39,566
Ohh, That's the problem,

666
00:35:39,566 --> 00:35:45,527
You see, I want this magazine
to drink from the bottle,

667
00:35:50,145 --> 00:35:53,114
In talks? What the fuck, Alex?

668
00:35:53,114 --> 00:35:56,918
Tch, All right, in talks,

669
00:35:56,918 --> 00:35:58,545
I need this,

670
00:35:59,954 --> 00:36:01,623
All right, all right,

671
00:36:01,623 --> 00:36:04,192
NICHOLAS:
I suppose we've come a ways...

672
00:36:04,192 --> 00:36:06,761
since Sambo, Mr. Bojangles.

673
00:36:06,761 --> 00:36:08,596
"Step and fetch it, boy. "

674
00:36:08,596 --> 00:36:12,267
"What?
Man, call me Mr. Tibbs... "

675
00:36:12,267 --> 00:36:13,902
we've heard Poitier say.

676
00:36:13,902 --> 00:36:15,770
It's a new day, some say.

677
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:18,940
Because every now and then,
black men are even in.

678
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:23,111
Motion picture heroes.
It's the American way, Wesley.

679
00:36:23,111 --> 00:36:25,313
Be cute
and still save the world.

680
00:36:25,313 --> 00:36:27,115
Yes, we will, Will.

681
00:36:27,115 --> 00:36:29,817
Go from Boy in the Hood
to Man of Honor.

682
00:36:29,817 --> 00:36:31,519
Show 'em the money now, Cuba.

683
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:33,454
Give 'em funnies
like Chris Rock or Tucker,

684
00:36:33,454 --> 00:36:35,857
Or just cool it,
be anybody, like Denzel,

685
00:36:35,857 --> 00:36:40,128
But wait, He ain't even really
getting no loving,,,

686
00:36:40,128 --> 00:36:43,631
Iike Sidney before him
and whoever after him,

687
00:36:43,631 --> 00:36:46,100
Romancin' and dancin'
with amore's passion,,,

688
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,436
ain't in the script's equation,

689
00:36:48,436 --> 00:36:50,205
But can even Mr, Washington,,,

690
00:36:50,205 --> 00:36:52,106
briefly be seen kissing
a Pretty Woman,,,

691
00:36:52,106 --> 00:36:54,175
underneath a Pelican Moon?

692
00:36:54,175 --> 00:36:56,911
Can even he be a romantic lead?

693
00:36:56,911 --> 00:37:00,014
Check it, From Sambo to Sidney
to Denzel to me,

694
00:37:00,014 --> 00:37:02,717
Brothers ain't getting
nor giving no love now,

695
00:37:02,717 --> 00:37:06,321
I don't want to complain, but
my doctor says I'm suffering,,,

696
00:37:06,321 --> 00:37:08,990
from underloved syndrome,

697
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:12,627
Maybe it is a conspiracy,
But do folks still fear,,,

698
00:37:12,627 --> 00:37:16,064
the black man's sexuality
like that?

699
00:37:16,064 --> 00:37:20,301
A fear that could be wiped out
just by seeing us love,,,

700
00:37:20,301 --> 00:37:22,370
not by race, but by heart,

701
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:24,806
And can't a brother
get some love?

702
00:37:24,806 --> 00:37:26,874
Now, that, Catherine,,,

703
00:37:26,874 --> 00:37:29,344
is a question
for the screen pages,,,

704
00:37:29,344 --> 00:37:31,679
written by folks
who rarely look like me,,,

705
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:35,149
but want to see me
run and jump and shoot,,,

706
00:37:35,149 --> 00:37:39,220
but don't care to see me kiss
a woman with my skin tone,,,

707
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,624
and would shoot me if I were
kissing a woman of their hue,

708
00:37:42,624 --> 00:37:45,059
Who are you?

709
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:47,428
Who are you? Who are we?

710
00:37:47,428 --> 00:37:50,198
We are human, too,,,

711
00:37:50,198 --> 00:37:54,602
and we love loving, and,,,

712
00:37:54,602 --> 00:37:57,805
can't a brother get some love?

713
00:37:57,805 --> 00:37:59,574
That's the state of being,,,

714
00:37:59,574 --> 00:38:03,533
a chocolate leading man
in Hollywood today,

715
00:38:06,714 --> 00:38:07,882
[Click]

716
00:38:07,882 --> 00:38:07,948
I keep bringing it up,,,

717
00:38:07,948 --> 00:38:09,049
I keep bringing it up,,,

718
00:38:09,049 --> 00:38:10,216
because I don't want you
to think I forgot,

719
00:38:10,216 --> 00:38:12,085
Look, you just pay me back
when you have all of it,

720
00:38:12,085 --> 00:38:14,254
-I have half now, so--

-Keep it, I don't want--

721
00:38:14,254 --> 00:38:16,256
-lt just feels awkward,
-Please,

722
00:38:16,256 --> 00:38:19,392
-Hi,
-Right this way,

723
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,593
-Thank you,
-Thanks,

724
00:38:20,593 --> 00:38:21,761
What would you like
to start with?

725
00:38:21,761 --> 00:38:23,596
Some evian or pellegrino?

726
00:38:23,596 --> 00:38:25,999
-Thank you,
-You're welcome,

727
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:28,969
You still going on your weekend
with that guy from the internet?

728
00:38:28,969 --> 00:38:30,370
Mm-hmm,
No, I haven't cancelled,

729
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:32,038
I'm putting myself out there,
I'm going,

730
00:38:32,038 --> 00:38:33,573
Good,
You need money for that,

731
00:38:33,573 --> 00:38:35,508
You want me to meet men,

and I'm meeting men,

732
00:38:35,508 --> 00:38:36,676
You could meet men there,
There'll be plenty,

733
00:38:36,676 --> 00:38:38,845
I can't come tonight,
I can't,

734
00:38:38,845 --> 00:38:40,947
On the internet?
How is that meeting?

735
00:38:40,947 --> 00:38:42,141
It's encountering,

736
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:46,353
What airline are you flying?

737
00:38:46,353 --> 00:38:47,520
Southwest.

738
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,888
-Southwest?
-Yeah,

739
00:38:48,888 --> 00:38:51,458
That's a good airline,

740
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:54,561
Southwest, younger man,,,

741
00:38:54,561 --> 00:38:57,197
new underwear, Tucson,

Holiday lnn,

742
00:38:57,197 --> 00:38:58,365
What is your point?

743
00:38:58,365 --> 00:38:59,899
Have you ever stayed
at a Holiday lnn?

744
00:38:59,899 --> 00:39:01,368
No, Have you?

745
00:39:01,368 --> 00:39:02,969
I think that's what's
really bothering me.

746
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:04,170
You know what, Lee?

He's paying for it,

747
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,772
So if that's what's
really bothering you--

748
00:39:05,772 --> 00:39:07,774
-What does he do?
-He's an artist,

749
00:39:07,774 --> 00:39:09,242
-An actor,
-A painter,

750
00:39:09,242 --> 00:39:10,410
In Tucson?

751
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,178
Yeah, He says the desert
inspires him,

752
00:39:12,178 --> 00:39:15,382
-Lend me what?
-What is wrong with you?

753
00:39:15,382 --> 00:39:19,452
Seriously, what is wrong
with you right now?

754
00:39:19,452 --> 00:39:22,455
Friday. Fridays are good.
T. G. I. F. Fridays are good, Lee.

755
00:39:22,455 --> 00:39:24,480
You're acting insane.

756
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,729
I'm going to have the squash,

757
00:39:29,729 --> 00:39:32,699
But this is
a boundary issue, man!

758
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:37,637
What I do off-stage is
my process and my business, OK?

759
00:39:37,637 --> 00:39:39,305
And I don't care
what anybody thinks.

760
00:39:39,305 --> 00:39:41,408
And it's my business
to put on a play,

761
00:39:41,408 --> 00:39:44,144
And now I've got three hours
to find a new Eva Braun,

762
00:39:44,144 --> 00:39:46,413
Oh, OK, You know what?

Fuck her,

763
00:39:46,413 --> 00:39:48,548
And here's why, Number one--

764
00:39:48,548 --> 00:39:51,017
anyone who's offended
by drinking blood,,,

765
00:39:51,017 --> 00:39:52,819
obviously doesn't drink blood,

766
00:39:52,819 --> 00:39:55,855
Number two--anybody who drinks
as much blood as I do,,,

767
00:39:55,855 --> 00:39:57,757
knows it has no effect,

768
00:39:57,757 --> 00:39:59,592
Number three--

769
00:39:59,592 --> 00:40:02,062
there is absolutely
no scientific connection,,,

770
00:40:02,062 --> 00:40:03,897
between drinking
a shot of blood a day,,,

771
00:40:03,897 --> 00:40:05,799
and being
an extraordinary actor,

772
00:40:05,799 --> 00:40:10,370
And number 4--it is impossible
to prove number 3,

773
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,472
You know, do the words Masai

mean anything to you?

774
00:40:12,472 --> 00:40:13,873
Do you know who that is?

775
00:40:13,873 --> 00:40:16,042
Yeah, Herzog made
a documentary about them,

776
00:40:16,042 --> 00:40:18,278
The herdsmen of fire,
warriors of Africa.

777
00:40:18,278 --> 00:40:19,879
They drank blood.

778
00:40:19,879 --> 00:40:21,948
Jack fucking LaLanne
drank blood in the fifties.

779
00:40:21,948 --> 00:40:23,750
Yeah, granted,
his wife wouldn't kiss him...

780
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,285
but this is bullshit, man.

781
00:40:25,285 --> 00:40:27,353
I don't care what you do
outside of this theater,

782
00:40:27,353 --> 00:40:30,623
I don't give a shit, You could
eat the ass out of a dead wolf,

783
00:40:30,623 --> 00:40:32,525
I don't care,

784
00:40:32,525 --> 00:40:34,761
Just keep it to yourself, OK?

785
00:40:34,761 --> 00:40:37,163
Just keep it to yourself,

786
00:40:37,163 --> 00:40:39,599
I think it's fucking hysterical
that she walked,

787
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,601
And I know comedy,

788
00:40:41,601 --> 00:40:43,069
LINDA: I don't understand.

789
00:40:43,069 --> 00:40:44,737
I don't understand
what's wrong.

790
00:40:44,737 --> 00:40:46,239
I mean, birthdays are fun.

791
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:49,709
Well, OK, this is mom

when I was four,,,

792
00:40:49,709 --> 00:40:51,811
at my birthday
introducing me to people,

793
00:40:51,811 --> 00:40:57,217
"And this is Lee, She ruined
my body, didn't you, dear?"

794
00:40:57,217 --> 00:40:58,818
-There,
-Thanks,

795
00:40:58,818 --> 00:41:00,720
I won't be here tomorrow,
so happy birthday.

796
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,390
Oh, It's smaller than the gift
you gave me last year,,,

797
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,292
for my fortieth birthday,

798
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:08,228
You know what, Lee, you make
forty a bigger deal than it is.

799
00:41:08,228 --> 00:41:10,964
You have no idea about forty,

800
00:41:10,964 --> 00:41:12,799
I'll be forty.

801
00:41:12,799 --> 00:41:14,567
What did I give you last year?
I don't even remember.

802
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:18,605
You know, that--that thing,
That,,,

803
00:41:18,605 --> 00:41:22,942
-Oh, You didn't like it?
-No,

804
00:41:22,942 --> 00:41:25,445
Well, honestly,
I would have rather had...

805
00:41:25,445 --> 00:41:27,147
just, like,
a card or something.

806
00:41:27,147 --> 00:41:28,448
OK, God,

807
00:41:28,448 --> 00:41:29,849
It's just a weird gift
to give your sister...

808
00:41:29,849 --> 00:41:31,885
who's married,
on her fortieth birthday.

809
00:41:31,885 --> 00:41:33,887
You know what Gus gave me
last year for my birthday?

810
00:41:33,887 --> 00:41:36,823
First edition of Bernard Shaw's
The Sanity of Art.

811
00:41:36,823 --> 00:41:39,425
Did you get anything out of it?

812
00:41:39,425 --> 00:41:41,723
-Which?
-The gift I gave you,

813
00:41:44,063 --> 00:41:46,065
Are you kidding?

814
00:41:46,065 --> 00:41:49,068
No, I mean, yes or no,

815
00:41:49,068 --> 00:41:50,537
But for my fortieth birthday?

816
00:41:50,537 --> 00:41:53,439
Well, I have one, so,,,

817
00:41:53,439 --> 00:41:55,441
I used it once.

818
00:41:55,441 --> 00:41:59,078
OK, All right,
Well, what happened?

819
00:41:59,078 --> 00:42:01,239
Um, I got stuck in the chair,

820
00:42:02,916 --> 00:42:06,786
You used it in a chair?

821
00:42:06,786 --> 00:42:10,423
Well, yeah,
that's what's on the box,

822
00:42:10,423 --> 00:42:13,026
Different ways. I've never...

823
00:42:13,026 --> 00:42:15,361
Not in a chair. I've never...

824
00:42:15,361 --> 00:42:17,530
Well,,,

825
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:20,433
gift-giving--
you know, it's an art,

826
00:42:20,433 --> 00:42:22,802
You should have
the person in mind--

827
00:42:22,802 --> 00:42:25,338
OK, I'm sorry, I thought
you'd like it, I like it--

828
00:42:25,338 --> 00:42:27,607
Well, that's--
but you should give people...

829
00:42:27,607 --> 00:42:29,175
what you think
they would want--

830
00:42:29,175 --> 00:42:30,710
you know, something personal.

831
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,012
How much more personal
could that be?

832
00:42:33,012 --> 00:42:36,015
But then, you and that guy--
what was his name?

833
00:42:36,015 --> 00:42:37,317
-Tom,
-Tom,

834
00:42:37,317 --> 00:42:39,919
Yeah. You sat at
the other end of the table...

835
00:42:39,919 --> 00:42:41,788
and just stared
at each other the whole time.

836
00:42:41,788 --> 00:42:43,756
You didn't even
really socialize.

837
00:42:43,756 --> 00:42:46,059
Oh, my God, Oh, my God,
Lee, forgive me, OK?

838
00:42:46,059 --> 00:42:49,262
I happened to be in love--
for a brief period of time,

839
00:42:49,262 --> 00:42:50,897
Once--which happened
to include,,,

840
00:42:50,897 --> 00:42:52,265
the week of your birthday,

841
00:42:52,265 --> 00:42:53,833
-This is all a year later,
-You don't get it,

842
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:55,535
Christ!

843
00:42:55,535 --> 00:42:57,136
You know what?
Gift--it's a gift,

844
00:42:57,136 --> 00:42:58,805
A gift is a gift,
Don't question it,

845
00:42:58,805 --> 00:43:02,241
At least not to the giver
and out loud a whole year later,

846
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:05,002
Chr--

847
00:43:06,512 --> 00:43:08,381
-OK, now I know,

-What?

848
00:43:08,381 --> 00:43:09,949
Well, that it meant something
to you,

849
00:43:09,949 --> 00:43:11,918
What?

850
00:43:11,918 --> 00:43:15,285
Just the whole thing,
that you put thought into it,

851
00:43:21,027 --> 00:43:23,518
You know,
it's for your small change.

852
00:43:25,966 --> 00:43:28,535
FRANCESCA: So he gives me
this injection...

853
00:43:28,535 --> 00:43:31,338
and I become invisible.

854
00:43:31,338 --> 00:43:33,039
And I can do anything, right?

855
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:34,874
Because, you know,
I'm invisible.

856
00:43:34,874 --> 00:43:39,779
What do I do? I go to
one of my colleagues, Carl...

857
00:43:39,779 --> 00:43:42,782
and I make him
sign a confession...

858
00:43:42,782 --> 00:43:45,986
while I hold a knife
to his neck.

859
00:43:45,986 --> 00:43:50,156
Now, it's just weird,
because I really like Carl.

860
00:43:50,156 --> 00:43:52,392
He's a brilliant,

talented man,,,

861
00:43:52,392 --> 00:43:55,061
completely misunderstood
by his boss,

862
00:43:55,061 --> 00:43:59,866
Well, you know, I'm not
surprised he was in my dream,,,

863
00:43:59,866 --> 00:44:04,064
really, because
I think of him a lot,

864
00:44:06,006 --> 00:44:08,608
I think I'm actually--

865
00:44:08,608 --> 00:44:10,210
MAN: Wheel in Nicholas.
We're ready for him.

866
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:11,511
It's funny, because
he's one of these guys--

867
00:44:11,511 --> 00:44:13,213
You know what?
I want to tell you,,,

868
00:44:13,213 --> 00:44:16,583
what I think about that,

but I gotta go do this,

869
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:20,178
OK, I'll be here--listening,

870
00:44:22,355 --> 00:44:23,523
Hey, Pitty,

871
00:44:23,523 --> 00:44:25,525
[Laughs]

872
00:44:25,525 --> 00:44:27,027
Hey, man, What's going on?

873
00:44:27,027 --> 00:44:29,963
OK, exactly the same thing,
We're starting from over here,

874
00:44:29,963 --> 00:44:31,297
It took me a little bit--

875
00:44:31,297 --> 00:44:32,499
I needed to do this
with track,,,

876
00:44:32,499 --> 00:44:33,666
instead of just the walk-up,,,

877
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:35,368
so we're gonna do
a little bit of a push-in,

878
00:44:35,368 --> 00:44:37,203
There's probably
going to be some focus stuff,,,

879
00:44:37,203 --> 00:44:38,705
so we're gonna shoot a few,

880
00:44:38,705 --> 00:44:39,873
OK,

881
00:44:39,873 --> 00:44:41,541
But just split the extras
as they come through--

882
00:44:41,541 --> 00:44:42,876
don't be precious about it,

883
00:44:42,876 --> 00:44:44,377
Tell them we're coming through,

884
00:44:44,377 --> 00:44:46,679
I will, I will,

885
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:50,050
R-1 39, take one,

886
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:53,319
[Man muttering]

887
00:44:53,319 --> 00:44:55,755
And background action--action!

888
00:44:55,755 --> 00:44:57,457
Move! Move!

889
00:44:57,457 --> 00:45:00,560
-Out of the way!
-Goddamn it,

890
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,063
Uh, looks like we're late,

891
00:45:03,063 --> 00:45:05,131
Looks like,

892
00:45:05,131 --> 00:45:07,500
Back to square one,

893
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,469
That's what he thinks,

894
00:45:09,469 --> 00:45:12,338
You think different?

895
00:45:12,338 --> 00:45:14,507
Like the back
of my big ten-inch,

896
00:45:14,507 --> 00:45:17,010
-Oh,
-Come on,

897
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:19,412
[Sighs]

898
00:45:19,412 --> 00:45:21,414
CARL: One minute
I'm drinking a beer...

899
00:45:21,414 --> 00:45:23,349
and the next minute
I'm unemployed.

900
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:24,651
How does that happen?

901
00:45:24,651 --> 00:45:26,175
[Laughs]

902
00:45:34,861 --> 00:45:37,030
He said I have confused,,,

903
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:40,056
my personality quirks
with standards,

904
00:45:41,534 --> 00:45:44,037
What the fuck?

905
00:45:44,037 --> 00:45:47,507
CARL: You have no idea
what I have lost just now.

906
00:45:47,507 --> 00:45:53,179
This goes way beyond this job.
I could lose everything.

907
00:45:53,179 --> 00:45:55,748
The ripple effect.
It's the ripple effect.

908
00:45:55,748 --> 00:45:58,251
It's like, "Oh, yeah,
by the way, you're fired. "

909
00:45:58,251 --> 00:46:00,453
"Oh, yeah, honey, by the way...

910
00:46:00,453 --> 00:46:02,355
"uh, you don 't think
I'm so great.

911
00:46:02,355 --> 00:46:04,691
"Guess what? They don 't think
I'm so great at work.

912
00:46:04,691 --> 00:46:06,192
"Hey, maybe I'm not so great. "

913
00:46:06,192 --> 00:46:08,628
Hey, that's simple.
Well, there, I can write that.

914
00:46:08,628 --> 00:46:09,762
I can write,
"I'm not so great. "

915
00:46:09,762 --> 00:46:11,197
Maybe I can write it...

916
00:46:11,197 --> 00:46:12,899
a hundred-fucking-thousand
times on a blackboard--

917
00:46:12,899 --> 00:46:14,334
Oh, I can teach.
I used to teach.

918
00:46:14,334 --> 00:46:16,469
I love teaching.
I do love teaching.

919
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:20,006
R-1 39, take 49, mark!

920
00:46:20,006 --> 00:46:25,745
MAN: OK, here we go!
And background! Action!

921
00:46:25,745 --> 00:46:27,046
BRAD., Move!

922
00:46:27,046 --> 00:46:28,715
-Out of the way!
-Move!

923
00:46:28,715 --> 00:46:30,617
-Move!
-Out of the way!

924
00:46:30,617 --> 00:46:34,020
Ohh, Looks like we're late,

925
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,421
Looks like,

926
00:46:35,421 --> 00:46:38,358
Back to square one,

927
00:46:38,358 --> 00:46:40,193
That's what he thinks,

928
00:46:40,193 --> 00:46:42,529
You think different?

929
00:46:42,529 --> 00:46:44,931
[Both panting]

930
00:46:44,931 --> 00:46:47,100
I know different,

931
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:48,635
Come on,

932
00:46:48,635 --> 00:46:51,137
[Sighs]

933
00:46:51,137 --> 00:46:53,765
-Cut it!
-OK, we got.

934
00:46:57,043 --> 00:46:58,411
Nice one.

935
00:46:58,411 --> 00:46:59,946
Very nice, very nice,

936
00:46:59,946 --> 00:47:01,314
Check the gate, Check the gate,

937
00:47:01,314 --> 00:47:02,916
BRAD., Lunch?

938
00:47:02,916 --> 00:47:05,351
OK,

939
00:47:05,351 --> 00:47:08,655
So, David, David,

You need me for anything?

940
00:47:08,655 --> 00:47:10,857
No, no, Absolutely,
Lunch--go ahead,

941
00:47:10,857 --> 00:47:13,291
-Nice scene, man,

-Yeah, thanks, Brad,

942
00:47:20,333 --> 00:47:22,502
Thanks,

943
00:47:22,502 --> 00:47:25,338
Would you not take a role
if you felt,,,

944
00:47:25,338 --> 00:47:28,239
the people of the black
community wouldn't like it?

945
00:47:29,676 --> 00:47:31,010
Hmm,

946
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:33,513
This guy that lives
in my neighborhood--

947
00:47:33,513 --> 00:47:34,981
Iives right across the street
from me,

948
00:47:34,981 --> 00:47:37,183
And he dresses like--
yeah, yeah,

949
00:47:37,183 --> 00:47:40,220
He dresses like a vampire
twenty-four hours a day,

950
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:42,622
I don't know if he's got a job,
I don't know what he does,,,

951
00:47:42,622 --> 00:47:45,024
but I know
he dresses like a vampire,,,

952
00:47:45,024 --> 00:47:47,393
Iike Dracula all the damn time,

953
00:47:47,393 --> 00:47:49,028
-You want to go?
-Mm,

954
00:47:49,028 --> 00:47:50,863
I mean, look,

I see this guy at Pavilion's,,,

955
00:47:50,863 --> 00:47:53,032
buying romaine lettuce
dressed as Dracula,,,

956
00:47:53,032 --> 00:47:54,701
so you got to figure,,,

957
00:47:54,701 --> 00:47:57,704
he's an actor, right?
He's got to be,

958
00:47:57,704 --> 00:47:59,038
Well, you could find out,

959
00:47:59,038 --> 00:48:03,042
Yeah, The point is, the answer
to your question is,,,

960
00:48:03,042 --> 00:48:06,145
if I needed the money,
abso-fucking-lutely,

961
00:48:06,145 --> 00:48:08,147
Absolutely,
Now, am I proud of that?

962
00:48:08,147 --> 00:48:10,483
No,
But, yeah, I'd take it,,,

963
00:48:10,483 --> 00:48:12,951
'cause, look,

a brother's got to eat,

964
00:48:19,492 --> 00:48:23,258
-OK, Are they gonna say cut?
-I don't know,

965
00:48:25,999 --> 00:48:27,728
OK, what's going on?

966
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:33,806
-OK, can somebody--
-Did they call cut?

967
00:48:33,806 --> 00:48:35,508
Well, can somebody
communicate--OK,

968
00:48:35,508 --> 00:48:38,845
Bonnie, Bonnie, this is

itching me so bad today,

969
00:48:38,845 --> 00:48:40,680
Fran, listen, listen,

Hey, after lunch,,,

970
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,315
next time we do this,
could you give me...

971
00:48:42,315 --> 00:48:43,483
more to work with
on this whole attraction--

972
00:48:43,483 --> 00:48:45,518
What do you mean?
That was good, huh?

973
00:48:45,518 --> 00:48:48,354
We can't hear in there, though,
We can't hear anything,

974
00:48:48,354 --> 00:48:50,356
No, 'cause I'm not feeling
the whole sexual chemistry,

975
00:48:50,356 --> 00:48:51,524
No, no, but remember,,,

976
00:48:51,524 --> 00:48:53,760
you gotta leave yourself
somewhere to go,,,

977
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,828
for the second letter
at the airport,

978
00:48:55,828 --> 00:48:58,698
All right, Oh!
All right, all right,

979
00:48:58,698 --> 00:49:00,266
Right?

980
00:49:00,266 --> 00:49:01,668
In the way it's got to build,,,

981
00:49:01,668 --> 00:49:02,835
you got to give me
something to go on,

982
00:49:02,835 --> 00:49:04,704
-We had it going before,
-Did he call?

983
00:49:04,704 --> 00:49:07,640
-Yeah,
-It's not working for me,

984
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,142
OK, well, if you're
going to stay for lunch,,,

985
00:49:09,142 --> 00:49:10,643
Iet's talk about
whatever it is--

986
00:49:10,643 --> 00:49:13,479
No, I gotta run an errand,
so next time--and maybe it's me,

987
00:49:13,479 --> 00:49:14,647
All right,

988
00:49:14,647 --> 00:49:16,316
We'll figure it out,
Don't worry about it,

989
00:49:16,316 --> 00:49:18,151
All right. I think it was good!
Oh, thanks.

990
00:49:18,151 --> 00:49:20,920
No, it's the movie,

This is the only movie,

991
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,411
As far as he's concerned,

it's the only movie,

992
00:49:31,631 --> 00:49:33,633
CALVIN: Hey, can you
hold that door for me?

993
00:49:33,633 --> 00:49:34,835
-Sure,
-Thank you,

994
00:49:34,835 --> 00:49:36,097
Got it?

995
00:49:42,642 --> 00:49:43,973
Excuse me,

996
00:49:51,351 --> 00:49:53,887
CARL: Oh, the film.
Well, the film--

997
00:49:53,887 --> 00:49:55,622
Artie and I wrote this.

998
00:49:55,622 --> 00:49:57,123
We started working together--

999
00:49:57,123 --> 00:49:59,259
really writing together,
about a year ago.

1000
00:49:59,259 --> 00:50:01,261
We tossed around
a couple of ideas.

1001
00:50:01,261 --> 00:50:04,831
And Artie's a pretty good
playwright in his own right.

1002
00:50:04,831 --> 00:50:07,934
And we thought,
you know, maybe this--

1003
00:50:07,934 --> 00:50:11,371
sort of my understanding
of Hollywood and everything...

1004
00:50:11,371 --> 00:50:14,074
and his ability
to actually write...

1005
00:50:14,074 --> 00:50:16,076
would be a good combination...

1006
00:50:16,076 --> 00:50:18,144
and so we came up
with this idea...

1007
00:50:18,144 --> 00:50:20,647
for what is now
Rendezvous, the movie.

1008
00:50:20,647 --> 00:50:24,050
It's almost like a spy film
in the intrigue...

1009
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:27,287
of this romantic encounter...

1010
00:50:27,287 --> 00:50:32,058
between this guy
that Calvin plays--

1011
00:50:32,058 --> 00:50:34,390
I'm sorry, there's a...

1012
00:50:36,062 --> 00:50:38,064
Uh, and this woman.

1013
00:50:38,064 --> 00:50:40,433
And anyway,
I think it's a neat story.

1014
00:50:40,433 --> 00:50:44,070
And I think it's a great cast.

1015
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:49,075
Um, uh, but, uh...

1016
00:50:49,075 --> 00:50:52,078
Yeah. I'm sorry,
I have some--it's weird.

1017
00:50:52,078 --> 00:50:55,348
I'm really happy about
the project. I really am.

1018
00:50:55,348 --> 00:50:58,585
I got--you know, there's--
I've got issues with some of--

1019
00:50:58,585 --> 00:51:02,088
Actually, Calvin. Calvin is,
I think, I don 't know--

1020
00:51:02,088 --> 00:51:03,423
You know, other people...

1021
00:51:03,423 --> 00:51:05,859
get more excited about him
than I do.

1022
00:51:05,859 --> 00:51:09,796
It's not to say I'm not happy
having him on the movie.

1023
00:51:09,796 --> 00:51:12,666
I think that's great, and
I'm sure he's very good in it.

1024
00:51:12,666 --> 00:51:18,538
I just don't get what
the big thing is with Calvin.

1025
00:51:18,538 --> 00:51:22,809
I think--you know, you picture
a role in a certain way...

1026
00:51:22,809 --> 00:51:25,679
And sometimes it's--
I'm not always right, either.

1027
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:28,515
I know, you know, certainly
my wife thinks he's great.

1028
00:51:28,515 --> 00:51:31,313

You know why
they love the winner?

1241
01:02:23,634 --> 01:02:26,470
Because they think
he knows something,

1242
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:29,906
I mean, he had to know

something in order to win,

1243
01:02:32,276 --> 01:02:35,279
So, we admire him,

But the winner doesn't
learn anything from winning,

No, the loser--the loser

learns something about himself,

Losing teaches you
about yourself.

1247
01:02:49,827 --> 01:02:51,262
So, the loser's the winner.

Look, you liked it,,,

1368
01:10:32,656 --> 01:10:34,191
and you've told me
you haven't liked things,

1369
01:10:34,191 --> 01:10:36,693
You liked it, Man, listen,

I don't want you telling me,,,

1370
01:10:36,693 --> 01:10:37,861
you're not going to pursue
any more meetings...

1371
01:10:37,861 --> 01:10:39,229
because
this is what I want to do.

1372
01:10:39,229 --> 01:10:42,199
I'm serious, OK?

1373
01:10:42,199 --> 01:10:45,930
Hey, listen. Could you, like...

1374
01:10:47,037 --> 01:10:49,273
It's better now,
It's a lot better now,

1375
01:10:49,273 --> 01:10:50,440
Ed and l,

we've been working on it,

1376
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:51,608
We've been
beefing up the scenes,

1377
01:10:51,608 --> 01:10:52,876
And that whole thing
you mentioned...

1378
01:10:52,876 --> 01:10:54,511
I agree with you--
about me being in it.

1379
01:10:54,511 --> 01:10:55,846
I'm not going to do it.

1380
01:10:55,846 --> 01:10:59,383
Even if they ask about it,
we're not going to build it in.

1381
01:10:59,383 --> 01:11:01,685
I figure, you know,
in the long run...

1382
01:11:01,685 --> 01:11:03,420
it's probably a good thing,,,

1383
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:07,691
me trying to establish myself
as a writer instead of an actor,

1384
01:11:07,691 --> 01:11:10,627
Like Pinter. You know, Pinter,
he was an actor.

1385
01:11:10,627 --> 01:11:12,963
He started off as an actor,

1386
01:11:12,963 --> 01:11:15,454
He still acts, occasionally.

1387
01:11:19,069 --> 01:11:21,264
All right, this shit
is cyclical, you know that?

1388
01:11:26,844 --> 01:11:30,614
All right, don't.
Don't, don't, don't.

1389
01:11:30,614 --> 01:11:31,849
I got it,

1390
01:11:31,849 --> 01:11:34,318
OK, Thank you,

1391
01:11:34,318 --> 01:11:36,309
[Line ringing]

1392
01:11:45,929 --> 01:11:48,031
If you stop telling me
that that letter makes sense,,,

1393
01:11:48,031 --> 01:11:49,933
you can throw up all you want,
How about that?

1394
01:11:49,933 --> 01:11:51,635
Tch, Yeah, Aw,

1395
01:11:51,635 --> 01:11:53,003
Do you know her?

1396
01:11:53,003 --> 01:11:55,839
-Ahem, Who?
-Carl's wife,

1397
01:11:55,839 --> 01:11:57,774
Nuh-uh,

1398
01:11:57,774 --> 01:12:00,477
That's kind of funny, because
I've heard things, actually,

1399
01:12:00,477 --> 01:12:02,279
Yeah. Yeah.
A couple of them.

1400
01:12:02,279 --> 01:12:05,649
-Hey, how are you doing?
-Uhh,

1401
01:12:05,649 --> 01:12:06,717
Hey, Fran, listen,
I want you to meet--

1402
01:12:06,717 --> 01:12:09,820
Frannie, It's Lucy Morgan,
L,A, Magazine,

1403
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:12,155
-I'm sorry, l--
-The Sedona piece,

1404
01:12:12,155 --> 01:12:14,057
Oh, my God, Yes, Oh, wow,

1405
01:12:14,057 --> 01:12:16,326
Wow, You changed your hair
or something?

1406
01:12:16,326 --> 01:12:19,196
Yeah, How do you know Cal?

1407
01:12:19,196 --> 01:12:21,365
-Uh, we--
-It was a dinner.

1408
01:12:21,365 --> 01:12:23,300
Yeah.

1409
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:24,961
Excuse me,

1410
01:12:27,571 --> 01:12:29,402
Hey,

1411
01:12:30,407 --> 01:12:31,942
Hi,

1412
01:12:31,942 --> 01:12:35,545
Is it--is it upstairs,
or is it in there?

1413
01:12:35,545 --> 01:12:36,813
God,

1414
01:12:36,813 --> 01:12:39,082
-Oh, this is wrong,
-No,

1415
01:12:39,082 --> 01:12:40,784
-I'm overdressed,
-You look,,,

1416
01:12:40,784 --> 01:12:43,754
-I wasn't sure what,,,
-It's on the roof,

1417
01:12:43,754 --> 01:12:44,988
Where's Carl?

1418
01:12:44,988 --> 01:12:47,190
He's not here yet,
I just, um,,,

1419
01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:49,359
-We should go up and,,,
-OK,

1420
01:12:49,359 --> 01:12:50,360
-Wow,
-You OK?

1421
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:51,995
Yeah,

1422
01:12:51,995 --> 01:12:53,163
You know,

I wish I didn't have this on,

1423
01:12:53,163 --> 01:12:55,599
No, You look great,

1424
01:12:55,599 --> 01:12:57,401
Well,,,

1425
01:12:57,401 --> 01:12:59,670
You know, I have to admire you
for your belief,,,

1426
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:01,405
in this project,
but the reality...

1427
01:13:01,405 --> 01:13:03,307
is a whole different thing
altogether.

1428
01:13:03,307 --> 01:13:04,741
It's all marketplace shit,

1429
01:13:04,741 --> 01:13:06,176
And I don't think that
this is a good role for you...

1430
01:13:06,176 --> 01:13:07,444
so don't even push that.

1431
01:13:07,444 --> 01:13:09,012
When does this article
come out?

1432
01:13:09,012 --> 01:13:11,248
In a couple of months,

1433
01:13:11,248 --> 01:13:12,772
Well, you call me,,,

1434
01:13:14,651 --> 01:13:17,487
if you can't get any answers
out of this guy,

1435
01:13:17,487 --> 01:13:19,289
Thank you.

1436
01:13:19,289 --> 01:13:20,891
Nice to meet you,

1437
01:13:20,891 --> 01:13:22,552
Nice seeing you,

1438
01:13:24,594 --> 01:13:26,530
Huh?

1439
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:28,395
Huh?

1440
01:13:32,369 --> 01:13:33,603
"Meltzin. "

1441
01:13:33,603 --> 01:13:36,902
Name kind of suits him,
Oh, Nicholas,

1442
01:13:39,443 --> 01:13:39,610
No, it looks good,
Where'd you get that dress?

1443
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:42,446
No, it looks good,
Where'd you get that dress?

1444
01:13:42,446 --> 01:13:44,014
-Seaver,
-Where?

1445
01:13:44,014 --> 01:13:46,116
On Third, Do you know it?

1446
01:13:46,116 --> 01:13:48,051
-ls it good?
-Yeah,

1447
01:13:48,051 --> 01:13:51,418
-lt was on sale, I like it,
-No, it's,,,

1448
01:13:59,429 --> 01:14:00,760
Oh,

1449
01:14:01,898 --> 01:14:03,422
God,

1450
01:14:07,804 --> 01:14:10,440
All chromium is not bad,

though,,,

1451
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,242
because
I get Fitness magazine,,,

1452
01:14:12,242 --> 01:14:13,937
I need a drink,

1453
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:22,386
No, I'm saying there's
a lot of good chromiums,

1454
01:14:22,386 --> 01:14:24,388
-I read it in a magazine,
-Hey,

1455
01:14:24,388 --> 01:14:26,156
Hey, I wouldn't go
to the lengths,,,

1456
01:14:26,156 --> 01:14:28,158
of bathing in bottled water,
that's all I'm saying,

1457
01:14:28,158 --> 01:14:29,493
I believe what you're saying,

1458
01:14:29,493 --> 01:14:31,495
-Franny Davis?
-Yeah,

1459
01:14:31,495 --> 01:14:32,962
Sam Osborne.

1460
01:14:34,564 --> 01:14:37,634
-I'm sorry,
-The Duchess of Malfi,

1461
01:14:37,634 --> 01:14:39,970
-Birchers,
-Yeah,

1462
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:42,739
I was the lighting guy,

1463
01:14:42,739 --> 01:14:46,243
Mmm, Oh, my God, Oh, OK, Yeah,

1464
01:14:46,243 --> 01:14:47,944
-Sam Osborne,
-Osborne,

1465
01:14:47,944 --> 01:14:49,479
-How are you?
-Nice to see you again,

1466
01:14:49,479 --> 01:14:51,581
Oh, you, too, Wow, That's funny,

1467
01:14:51,581 --> 01:14:52,749
-Yeah,
-That's--

1468
01:14:52,749 --> 01:14:56,353
Do you remember when you said,,,

1469
01:14:56,353 --> 01:14:59,489
"l feel like a waitress
on vacation"?

1470
01:14:59,489 --> 01:15:00,824
Oh, God,

1471
01:15:00,824 --> 01:15:04,061
It was, like, just the cutest
thing I've ever heard, and,,,

1472
01:15:04,061 --> 01:15:05,262
I don't know why
that just stuck out,

1473
01:15:05,262 --> 01:15:07,864
I don't--yeah,
I just--um, well,,,

1474
01:15:07,864 --> 01:15:10,200
-I was going to go,,,
-OK,

1475
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,669
Jesus, You remember that?

1476
01:15:12,669 --> 01:15:14,471
Yeah,

1477
01:15:14,471 --> 01:15:16,707
Yeah, I do,

1478
01:15:16,707 --> 01:15:19,209
-I got a funny memory that way,
-Oh,

1479
01:15:19,209 --> 01:15:21,178
Anyway, hey,
l--I don't want to bug you,

1480
01:15:21,178 --> 01:15:22,579
I know you got
lots of people to see,

1481
01:15:22,579 --> 01:15:24,648
I just wanted to say
how happy I am for you, and,,,

1482
01:15:24,648 --> 01:15:25,916
Oh, thanks, Thank you,

1483
01:15:25,916 --> 01:15:28,385
It's--I always thought
you had something special,

1484
01:15:28,385 --> 01:15:30,120
This,,,

1485
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:34,391
You know, it's just amazing
what you've been able to do,,,

1486
01:15:34,391 --> 01:15:37,627
-well, from,,,

-From nothing, Ha ha ha!

1487
01:15:37,627 --> 01:15:39,463
Or, well,,,yeah,

1488
01:15:39,463 --> 01:15:41,932
No, I'm just--I'm--thank you,
Thank you,

1489
01:15:41,932 --> 01:15:44,167
Right, Good, Well, hey,,,

1490
01:15:44,167 --> 01:15:46,737
-Cheers, Good to see you,
-Thank you, Cheers,

1491
01:15:46,737 --> 01:15:48,105
I couldn't "Cheers" you,
I don't have a drink,,,

1492
01:15:48,105 --> 01:15:51,308
but, well, shit,

Sam Osborne,,,

1493
01:15:51,308 --> 01:15:54,144
Ha ha!
Birchers lighting guy,

1494
01:15:54,144 --> 01:15:55,312
Birchers,

1495
01:15:55,312 --> 01:15:57,647
Get me a--
why don't you come with me?

1496
01:15:57,647 --> 01:15:59,182
[Laughs]

1497
01:15:59,182 --> 01:16:00,951
-Yeah, OK,
-OK,

1498
01:16:00,951 --> 01:16:04,187
-Nicholas, Oh, my goodness,
-Oh, God,

1499
01:16:04,187 --> 01:16:06,189
-Uhh,
-Let's get you on the sofa,

1500
01:16:06,189 --> 01:16:08,425
-Oh, God, did I just--
-Yes, you did,

1501
01:16:08,425 --> 01:16:10,427
-Ohh,
-Go slowly,

1502
01:16:10,427 --> 01:16:12,829
Ah, Catherine, I'm sorry,

1503
01:16:12,829 --> 01:16:13,997
Are you all right?

1504
01:16:13,997 --> 01:16:15,699
-Here's some water,
-Oh, thank you so much,

1505
01:16:15,699 --> 01:16:18,769
-I feel a little light headed,
-Here, have some water,

1506
01:16:18,769 --> 01:16:20,498
-Yeah,
-Drink it,

1507
01:16:22,105 --> 01:16:23,874
Yeah?
Are you sure you're all right?

1508
01:16:23,874 --> 01:16:26,910
-Mm-hmm,
-Thank goodness,

1509
01:16:26,910 --> 01:16:29,936
-I need to ask you something,
-What?

1510
01:16:31,414 --> 01:16:34,384
I need you to come back
to New York with me,

1511
01:16:34,384 --> 01:16:37,120
-Nicholas, I can't--

-No, It's the letter,

1512
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:40,257
Catherine, it's that letter,

I can't get it out of my head,

1513
01:16:40,257 --> 01:16:41,591
Well, but that was--

1514
01:16:41,591 --> 01:16:44,461
I've never had anybody
write me a love letter,

1515
01:16:44,461 --> 01:16:46,129
-Never,
-But I just--

1516
01:16:46,129 --> 01:16:49,366
No, listen,

You come back to New York,

1517
01:16:49,366 --> 01:16:52,602
You're here,
You there just makes sense,

1518
01:16:52,602 --> 01:16:57,140
You write the article,

and--and we go from there,

1519
01:16:57,140 --> 01:16:59,472
Nicholas, these kind of things--

1520
01:17:01,978 --> 01:17:04,970
A moment of inspiration,,,

1521
01:17:06,315 --> 01:17:08,977
that's all
anybody ever really wants,

1522
01:17:11,487 --> 01:17:12,647
Mmm,

1523
01:17:14,056 --> 01:17:16,158
To have an original idea,,,

1524
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:18,527
to fall in love,

1525
01:17:18,527 --> 01:17:21,931
It takes courage,,,

1526
01:17:21,931 --> 01:17:24,433
to surrender these things,

1527
01:17:24,433 --> 01:17:27,603
Especially when you have
control issues,

1528
01:17:27,603 --> 01:17:29,264
I get that a lot,

1529
01:17:30,706 --> 01:17:32,697
[Sighs]

1530
01:17:39,548 --> 01:17:41,350
I know what
they're going to talk about,,,

1531
01:17:41,350 --> 01:17:42,942
when they talk about me,

1532
01:17:44,553 --> 01:17:47,456
They're going to talk
about the mustache,

1533
01:17:47,456 --> 01:17:51,360
People are so fucking petty,

1534
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,095
People say,
"God, what's up with that?

1535
01:17:53,095 --> 01:17:55,231
"Like, didn't you know

I think
my favorite Gus moment,,,

1579
01:19:46,876 --> 01:19:50,446
was when he called me
at 1:20 in the morning...

1580

I really thought about him.

whatever I think about you,,,

thing at 10.00 in the morning,"

and film acting,,,

1617

how being on stage,,,

1618

01:25:00,522 --> 01:25:03,391
and I came up and I knocked
and he didn't answer, OK?

1705
01:25:03,391 --> 01:25:05,126
What? What?
Lee, I don't know what!

1706
01:25:05,126 --> 01:25:06,294
-Just wait,
-Fuck!

1707
01:25:06,294 --> 01:25:09,431
Wait for what? Oh, my God!

1708
01:25:09,431 --> 01:25:12,734
A few hours ago he was alive,
OK? He was really alive!

1709
01:25:12,734 --> 01:25:14,436
-Oh, man!

-Gus?

1710
01:25:14,436 --> 01:25:17,439
-Fuck, fuck! Do not touch him!

-He's cold,

1711
01:25:17,439 --> 01:25:19,040
-Jesus Christ!
-Oh, my God!

1712
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,542
Of course he's cold!

ifyou can calculate...

1714
01:25:22,010 --> 01:25:26,247
I don't know
if you can quantify...

1715
01:25:26,247 --> 01:25:30,185
the effect that would have
on a ten-year-old girl.

1716
01:25:30,185 --> 01:25:33,188
I think Lee is like...

1717
01:25:33,188 --> 01:25:37,492
Have you ever seen
a dog get hit by a car...

1718
01:25:37,492 --> 01:25:40,462
but walk away?

1719
01:25:40,462 --> 01:25:44,499
And... there's this impact...

1720
01:25:44,499 --> 01:25:46,601
and you know
something terrible...

1721
01:25:46,601 --> 01:25:48,737
has happened to that dog...

1722
01:25:48,737 --> 01:25:50,972
but it walks away...

1723
01:25:50,972 --> 01:25:55,076
and it doesn't seem to even
realize the implications...

1724
01:25:55,076 --> 01:25:56,478
'cause it just goes on.

1725
01:25:56,478 --> 01:26:00,348
But you know
that something terrible...

1726
01:26:00,348 --> 01:26:02,350
has happened inside this dog.

1727
01:26:02,350 --> 01:26:05,086
LEE:
Why do you think he did it?

1728
01:26:05,086 --> 01:26:08,790
Oh, God, I don't know,

1729
01:26:08,790 --> 01:26:14,162
It's some weird sex thing,
I don't know,

1730
01:26:14,162 --> 01:26:17,154
LEE: No. Not this.

1731
01:26:21,069 --> 01:26:23,171
Ohh,

1732
01:26:23,171 --> 01:26:24,973
CARL: That's, I think,
what happened to Lee.

1733
01:26:24,973 --> 01:26:26,741
It's like--it's like--

1734
01:26:26,741 --> 01:26:29,310
She's a dog that got hit by
a car, and she walked away...

1735
01:26:29,310 --> 01:26:33,648
and she's still walking, but...

1736
01:26:33,648 --> 01:26:35,517
LINDA: I don't know.
I guess he was really sad.

1737
01:26:35,517 --> 01:26:37,852
CARL: Some very, very
important things...

1738
01:26:37,852 --> 01:26:40,616
inside her are damaged.

1742
01:26:53,501 --> 01:26:58,206
CARL: So... my wife and I
were having trouble...

1743
01:26:58,206 --> 01:27:01,709
and I said I thought
maybe we were in a rut...

1744
01:27:01,709 --> 01:27:03,778
and that maybe
we should try something...

1745
01:27:03,778 --> 01:27:07,449
to liven things up,
and she said, "Like what?"

1746
01:27:07,449 --> 01:27:13,388
And I said like maybe we should
tape ourselves doing it.

1747
01:27:13,388 --> 01:27:15,490
And she was
completely shocked by this...

1748
01:27:15,490 --> 01:27:18,093
and she thought
it was beyond disgusting...

1749
01:27:18,093 --> 01:27:21,096
and that was that
for, like, four months.

1750
01:27:21,096 --> 01:27:23,364
And then one night,
out of the blue...

1751
01:27:23,364 --> 01:27:26,768
she says, "Let's do it. "

1752
01:27:26,768 --> 01:27:29,938
Ohh,,, [Laughs]

1753
01:27:29,938 --> 01:27:35,677
So, we get it all set up, and
I'm ready and she's ready,,,

1754
01:27:35,677 --> 01:27:40,014
and, uh, and she has gone out
and bought herself,,,

1755
01:27:40,014 --> 01:27:44,185
a little toy to use
in the video,

1756
01:27:44,185 --> 01:27:45,353
Really?

1757
01:27:45,353 --> 01:27:50,291
Well, it's not a little toy,
It's a--it's a huge,,,

No one has a--you know, OK,

1761
01:27:56,197 --> 01:27:57,966
Well, anyway, I took one look
at this thing,,,

1762
01:27:57,966 --> 01:28:00,268
and I knew
I would not be able to--

I couldn't,

1766
01:28:14,315 --> 01:28:16,749
So we haven't,

1767
01:28:17,785 --> 01:28:21,089
And, you know,,,

1768
01:28:21,089 --> 01:28:25,627
you can't come back
from something like that,

1769
01:28:25,627 --> 01:28:29,297
I don't know whether
she lost respect for me,,,

1770
01:28:29,297 --> 01:28:34,997
or I lost respect for myself,
but something was lost,

01:28:41,876 --> 01:28:45,680
I mean, I know professionally,
I'm gonna go back to teaching.

1774
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:47,081

01:29:19,414 --> 01:29:21,115
I guess she thinks...

01:29:21,115 --> 01:29:25,253
everyone and everything
is against her.

1788
01:29:28,823 --> 01:29:31,348
it keeps her from being happy.

when you're in love

I know that you're thinking
about them all the time.

You want to be with them
and see things with them.

1838

I think it's impossible.
It's an ideal to just think...

that you can actually
be kind all the time...

1840

in them or by them.

It's hard. I mean, it's like
the dream is short-lived.

to keep hoping that...

a really long time ago.

that it's just fate...

Iike, in the food court,
I met this guy, um...

and then he sat next to me
on the plane...

the weekend together.

1920
