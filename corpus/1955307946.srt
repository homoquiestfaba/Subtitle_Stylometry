1
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:50,123
# ...Sheds His grace on thee... #

2
00:00:52,115 --> 00:00:53,123
Hey, Dad.

3
00:00:53,241 --> 00:00:57,168
Man, "F" this wannabe holiday!

4
00:00:57,287 --> 00:00:58,295
What?

5
00:00:58,413 --> 00:01:00,465
The Fourth of July?
You hate the Fourth of July?

6
00:01:00,582 --> 00:01:02,135
- Yes.
- It's America's birthday!

7
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,465
- You don't like birthdays?
- After the bottle-rocket smoke clears,

8
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:09,727
day after tomorrow, all these
mouth-breathers are gonna be in my store

9
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:13,981
buying half-off Christmas ornaments.
You know it and I know it.

10
00:01:14,095 --> 00:01:16,480
- I don't know if I know it.
- Oh?

11
00:01:16,598 --> 00:01:19,730
What are you looking at? Oh, wow!

12
00:01:19,851 --> 00:01:22,070
Fifty Shades of He-e-ey!

13
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,239
Go talk to him!

14
00:01:24,355 --> 00:01:29,196
- No. He's... He's busy.
- He should be gettin' busy with you.

15
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:32,284
I... I can't go over there. What if he...

16
00:01:32,405 --> 00:01:34,742
What if he slaps me?

17
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:38,828
What? What if? What if instead of writing
the Declaration of Independence,

18
00:01:38,953 --> 00:01:42,133
George Washington wrote the
Declaration of Suffering in Silence

19
00:01:42,248 --> 00:01:43,802
with Your Raging Lady-boner?

20
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:46,385
- Okay.
- What if instead of freeing the slaves,

21
00:01:46,503 --> 00:01:48,971
Abraham Lincoln said, "Ye shall not pass!"

22
00:01:49,088 --> 00:01:51,853
Okay, well, that's was Gandalf,
but I know where you're going.

23
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:53,556
Go talk to him.

24
00:01:53,676 --> 00:01:57,473
I can't go over to that guy. He's like an
angel that's come down from outer space.

25
00:01:57,597 --> 00:02:00,397
Yeah, so ask him to probe you. Miaow!

26
00:02:00,517 --> 00:02:02,853
- I can't... I can't do it.
- Yes, you can!

27
00:02:02,977 --> 00:02:06,323
Look. Mister Pretty's off the phone.
Come on, do it.

28
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,990
How many of those have you had?
You seem drunk.

29
00:02:09,108 --> 00:02:11,956
I'm drunk. Deb, I haven't had dinner.

30
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,991
Deb! Deb! Deb!

31
00:02:14,113 --> 00:02:17,993
Deb! Deb! Deb! Deb! Deb!

32
00:02:18,117 --> 00:02:21,250
- Okay! Here goes nothing!
- Deb! Deb! Deb! Do it!

33
00:02:21,371 --> 00:02:23,542
Deb! Deb! Deb! Deb!

34
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:25,551
- Oh, sorry.
- Deb...

35
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:28,253
Deb, do it now. Go.

36
00:02:30,046 --> 00:02:31,600
See you.

37
00:02:32,924 --> 00:02:34,846
Oh, fuck me!

38
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:20,309
What the...

39
00:03:21,806 --> 00:03:27,109
Well, I think... I noticed that
she had red hair and that's about it.

40
00:03:27,228 --> 00:03:29,447
Stacy and I had this fight,

41
00:03:29,564 --> 00:03:33,028
then this person and I started drinking

42
00:03:33,151 --> 00:03:35,832
and talking and drinking.

43
00:03:35,945 --> 00:03:38,282
And the rest is kind of a blur.

44
00:03:38,406 --> 00:03:40,826
No, now she's here. She's still here. Yeah.

45
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,047
And I don't know how to get rid of her.

46
00:03:45,455 --> 00:03:48,420
No, I can't force her out.

47
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:52,507
I'm not gonna pull the fire alarm.

48
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:55,808
- White Russian and a whisky neat.
- Thanks, Billy.

49
00:03:55,924 --> 00:03:58,011
Oh, by gosh!

50
00:03:58,134 --> 00:04:00,353
You know my drink? Whoa!

51
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,476
Well, here's to the long,
straight piece in Tetris. Clink!

52
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:08,478
So, uh...

53
00:04:08,603 --> 00:04:10,275
I'm upset, too.

54
00:04:10,396 --> 00:04:13,196
...what are you doing in this gin joint?

55
00:04:13,316 --> 00:04:15,570
Let me talk some sense into him.

56
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:20,617
Uh-huh. He looks drunk and ready to explain
himself. Yeah. We'll get back to you. Okay.

57
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:26,588
Ryan, that was your dad. Please explain to me
why you told him to take that job and shove it?

58
00:04:26,704 --> 00:04:28,460
- No, I never said...
- He said you did.

59
00:04:28,581 --> 00:04:31,595
I told him I thought long and hard,
but I had to turn him down.

60
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:35,221
- I was gonna tell you tonight.
- I am your fiancÃ©e, all right?

61
00:04:35,338 --> 00:04:38,517
You tell me before you make
any stupid decisions.

62
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:41,765
And what exactly can we do for you, Fraggle?

63
00:04:41,886 --> 00:04:47,106
I... I'm sorry. This gentleman bought me
a drink and we were having a conservation.

64
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:51,318
Are you drinking his White Russian?
I told you that was a girl's drink.

65
00:04:51,437 --> 00:04:53,573
This is your drink?

66
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,446
Well, it was.

67
00:04:55,567 --> 00:05:00,573
I'm sorry. I drink them, too. I just thought
you were being amazingly intuitive.

68
00:05:00,697 --> 00:05:03,995
Oh, good for you, sweetie. Why don't you
just take it with our compliments, all right?

69
00:05:04,117 --> 00:05:07,214
- Billy! Another Russian and a Bird over here.
- Coming up.

70
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:10,792
Ryan, you need to call your dad
right now. You can still get this job...

71
00:05:10,915 --> 00:05:13,003
Stacy, I'm not working
for my father's company.

72
00:05:13,126 --> 00:05:14,929
We have this all figured out!

73
00:05:15,044 --> 00:05:18,722
You and I are gonna get married, your dad
is gonna get old, we're gonna take over.

74
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,889
What is going on with you? Are you
still into this "helping" people thing?

75
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:26,020
I am done talking about this. Okay?
Like she said, we were having a conversation.

76
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:28,476
Really? What's her name then?

77
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,941
- Estelle.
- Deborah.

78
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:33,108
What? You... you know my name?

79
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:36,527
No, I... You looked like a Deborah,
so obviously I was wrong.

80
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:39,579
No, my name is Deborah. You were right!

81
00:05:39,694 --> 00:05:42,198
I just said Estelle because I wanted
to get you out of the doghouse.

82
00:05:42,322 --> 00:05:44,825
- How would that have helped me?
- You know what?

83
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:48,497
You two enjoy each other.
Happy Independence Day.

84
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,874
- Because we're through.
- Stacy, this doesn't have to mean...

85
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:54,509
Yes, it does, Ryan! This is a package deal.

86
00:05:54,626 --> 00:05:57,094
So you can say goodbye to these.

87
00:05:59,923 --> 00:06:01,975
Trixie and Mayberry.

88
00:06:03,676 --> 00:06:06,394
- I loved those cats.
- You'll see them again.

89
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:08,933
She seems like a...

90
00:06:09,057 --> 00:06:10,978
sweet girl.

91
00:06:12,602 --> 00:06:15,105
Kev, come on, focus. Help me.

92
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,947
That is a solid move. No, man!

93
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:20,450
- I'm not gonna... Yeah, but that's your move.
- So?

94
00:06:20,568 --> 00:06:22,823
Not everybody can pull that off.

95
00:06:22,946 --> 00:06:26,374
Kev, you're breaking up
or something. Go back to...

96
00:06:26,491 --> 00:06:29,397
- Kev, are you there?
- Ryan!

97
00:06:42,549 --> 00:06:43,889
Excuse me?

98
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:46,476
Mmmm!

99
00:06:46,594 --> 00:06:48,765
Mmm, morning!

100
00:06:48,888 --> 00:06:51,606
Uh! I slept in, didn't I?

101
00:06:51,724 --> 00:06:53,564
Yeah, you sure did.

102
00:06:53,685 --> 00:06:56,734
So, what's on the agend'? Brunch?

103
00:06:56,855 --> 00:06:58,065
Ah, no.

104
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:01,286
Ooh! A black-coffee man. I like it.

105
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:04,414
"I'm John Wayne, I don't need no breakfast."

106
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:08,242
Ah, I actually already had my coffee, but...

107
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:13,171
Anyway, it's the Fourth, so I'm gonna go
spend some time with my family.

108
00:07:13,288 --> 00:07:15,756
- And maybe you should, too, right?
- Oh, my God!

109
00:07:15,874 --> 00:07:19,468
Oh, God! I must look terrible,
but... so soon.

110
00:07:19,586 --> 00:07:21,757
But I... I guess I could meet your family.

111
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,597
No, no, I actually meant your family.

112
00:07:24,716 --> 00:07:28,062
But either way, I have to go right now, so...

113
00:07:28,178 --> 00:07:31,772
Okay, well, just... do what
you gotta do, Mr Magoo.

114
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:35,437
I've got a book and I'll just, uh...

115
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,067
stay here.

116
00:07:37,187 --> 00:07:38,942
I'll see you in a couple of hours.

117
00:07:39,063 --> 00:07:41,151
Oh, um... Hey, uh, look,

118
00:07:41,274 --> 00:07:44,620
I don't exactly remember
what happened last night...

119
00:07:44,736 --> 00:07:48,283
Oh? Well, do you want
the slow-motion instant replay?

120
00:07:48,406 --> 00:07:50,292
Oh, great! Okay. Hey!

121
00:07:50,408 --> 00:07:51,749
- That's a...
- Oh, no!

122
00:07:51,868 --> 00:07:56,044
That was a family heirloom, but, uh,
you know what? Don't worry about it, please.

123
00:07:56,164 --> 00:07:57,552
Uh, please.

124
00:07:57,665 --> 00:07:59,635
Okay. Well, uh...

125
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:01,507
As you wish.

126
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:06,634
Um... Well, look, I think we can agree
that this was a mistake.

127
00:08:08,176 --> 00:08:10,477
Oh, yeah. Of course, a mistake!

128
00:08:10,595 --> 00:08:13,359
What? I'm glad you said it before I said it.

129
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:18,228
Cos I was gonna say it. There's a load off!

130
00:08:18,353 --> 00:08:21,152
Great! Okay. So we can leave. Now.

131
00:08:21,272 --> 00:08:22,281
Now?

132
00:08:22,398 --> 00:08:24,285
Yes, now is... now is...

133
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,868
is even, uh, too late for me.

134
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:31,495
Like I wish we could go in a time machine
and go back five minutes, and then leave then.

135
00:08:31,616 --> 00:08:34,546
But we don't, we don't have that,
so we just have to walk. So here we go.

136
00:08:34,661 --> 00:08:36,333
Where's the DeLorean
when you need one, right?

137
00:08:36,454 --> 00:08:38,625
- Okay.
- Yeah! Hello!

138
00:08:38,748 --> 00:08:41,596
McFly? Anybody home?

139
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:44,557
- Okay, there you go.
- Much obliged.

140
00:08:47,257 --> 00:08:49,843
So, you know, if we run into
each other around town,

141
00:08:49,968 --> 00:08:53,349
it doesn't need to be weird.
We can just say hello or wave...

142
00:08:53,471 --> 00:08:56,817
What a nice morning. It's...

143
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:59,436
Holidays are so peaceful, don't you think?

144
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:02,194
- I guess I never really...
- Listen, my children.

145
00:09:02,313 --> 00:09:06,157
And you will hear
of the midnight ride of Paul Revere.

146
00:09:06,276 --> 00:09:09,906
A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door.

147
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:12,912
And a word that will echo forever more.

148
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:16,913
Wow, that was actually nice.

149
00:09:17,036 --> 00:09:18,543
- Um...
- Thank you.

150
00:09:18,663 --> 00:09:20,585
- Have a good one.
- Oh...

151
00:09:20,707 --> 00:09:24,053
It's Longfellow.
He's from here. Portland, Maine.

152
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:28,973
- Yeah, I know where we live.
- I used to recite it for my mom every Fourth.

153
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:32,137
She's in a better place now.

154
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,099
Oh, I'm sorry.

155
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,361
Virginia Beach. They have
a lot of activities for seniors there.

156
00:09:38,474 --> 00:09:42,401
I try to go, but I'm so busy
with work at the TV station.

157
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,151
Hence, alone for the holiday!

158
00:09:46,274 --> 00:09:47,781
Okay, well, uh...

159
00:09:47,901 --> 00:09:50,155
God bless... America!

160
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:52,365
Hey, God bless you!

161
00:09:55,158 --> 00:09:57,210
Whoever you are.

162
00:10:05,376 --> 00:10:07,049
Deb, it's Rubes.

163
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:12,343
Call me as soon as you drag yourself out
of that fine man's bed, you complete whore.

164
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:14,887
Did you ever know that you're my hero...

165
00:10:15,011 --> 00:10:19,520
Great! Somebody's coming in the store and
they look drunk and I feel like ass today.

166
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:22,820
Hey! You break it, you buy it, bucko!

167
00:10:22,936 --> 00:10:25,154
Shit! Aah!

168
00:10:33,404 --> 00:10:35,825
Happy holidays. You've reached Yule Mart.

169
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:38,997
We'll be open July 4th until noon
and all day on the 5th.

170
00:10:39,118 --> 00:10:43,338
You'll love our frankincense
and myrrh-chandise! Get it?

171
00:10:43,873 --> 00:10:46,710
Hi, I don't know if I should be your hero.

172
00:10:46,835 --> 00:10:50,097
Homeboy didn't want to
see me again after last night.

173
00:10:50,213 --> 00:10:53,891
I guess, in the light of day,
I seemed like some sort of monster.

174
00:10:55,093 --> 00:10:57,679
Rubes, you gotta tell me
what happened last night,

175
00:10:57,804 --> 00:10:59,476
cos I don't remember bupkis.

176
00:10:59,597 --> 00:11:01,899
- Was I some sort of jackhole or something?
- Why won't she leave?

177
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,401
Hello?

178
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:10,783
Piece of kaka phone!

179
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:14,040
Really?

180
00:11:14,153 --> 00:11:15,162
Uh!

181
00:11:46,477 --> 00:11:47,652
Hello?

182
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:52,323
Joe?

183
00:11:54,777 --> 00:11:56,201
Anybody?

184
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:58,041
Don't!

185
00:11:59,574 --> 00:12:01,211
Don't make me!

186
00:12:01,326 --> 00:12:03,746
The parade's really gone downhill this year.

187
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,634
Come on! Get off!

188
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:10,803
All right, Joe...

189
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:13,932
I got a large Casco Bay blend here.

190
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:16,347
Joe?

191
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:18,932
All right.

192
00:12:19,677 --> 00:12:22,939
Oh, hey, man. There you are. What's going on?

193
00:12:24,015 --> 00:12:26,067
Dude, why are you eating a foot?

194
00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:30,988
Joe!

195
00:12:32,357 --> 00:12:33,656
Joe!

196
00:12:35,026 --> 00:12:37,446
Help! God!

197
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:41,439
Oh, my God!

198
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:44,584
What is that? This is horrible!

199
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,087
Joe!

200
00:13:01,052 --> 00:13:02,938
Sorry, Joe.

201
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:24,084
Come on, come on, come on!

202
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,335
- No, wait, wait! My place, my place!
- Okay.

203
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:28,673
What is this...

204
00:13:28,788 --> 00:13:32,798
Well, I've never seen one before, but it
seems, sort of, like a zombie apocalypse.

205
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,213
Oh! You know, at least
they're not the sprinter type.

206
00:13:36,337 --> 00:13:38,971
They're more of the old-school,
cerebral palsy variety.

207
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,305
Hey, that's Manny, from up the street.
He really does have CP.

208
00:13:42,427 --> 00:13:45,191
Oh, I'm sorry! I was just trying to...

209
00:13:45,305 --> 00:13:46,692
Whoa!

210
00:13:48,141 --> 00:13:49,778
Okay, some of them run!

211
00:13:51,811 --> 00:13:53,532
So sorry.

212
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:56,824
- So what are we gonna do?
- I don't know!

213
00:13:56,941 --> 00:13:59,955
I don't have a whole lot of experience
with this type of thing!

214
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:03,949
- Why are you taking off your shoes?
- Because it's filthy outside!

215
00:14:04,073 --> 00:14:07,458
Okay, okay, calm down.

216
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:12,923
Okay. We need information. We need to
figure out if it's affecting everyone.

217
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,093
Okay. TV.

218
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:18,219
Okay.

219
00:14:18,338 --> 00:14:20,425
Where's CNN?

220
00:14:20,548 --> 00:14:22,518
I don't have it. I got rid of
cable a couple of months ago.

221
00:14:22,634 --> 00:14:26,514
Oh, that's cool. I have some friends
that did that and it sounded so liberating.

222
00:14:26,638 --> 00:14:29,272
Though not actually that helpful right now!

223
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,442
I still get the local stuff.

224
00:14:32,685 --> 00:14:35,948
The annual event drew famished foodies
from Bangor to Brunswick

225
00:14:36,064 --> 00:14:38,318
to support the fire department's
annual pancake breakfast...

226
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:40,197
Good! It hasn't spread across town.

227
00:14:40,318 --> 00:14:42,703
No, not necessarily.
This is yesterday's broadcast.

228
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,585
Which you know because
you were running the camera.

229
00:14:45,698 --> 00:14:48,035
Are you being weirdly sarcastic
or how do you know that?

230
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:50,579
You told me last night that
you work at the news station.

231
00:14:50,703 --> 00:14:55,093
- Now why would they rerun a news broadcast?
- That's what I don't understand.

232
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,928
Radio! Do you have one?

233
00:14:57,043 --> 00:14:59,843
...Area and wait for help.
Repeat message 5-B.

234
00:14:59,963 --> 00:15:02,182
Couldn't we have taken
the radio out of the...

235
00:15:02,298 --> 00:15:04,553
- Stay in your homes with the doors locked.
- This is it!

236
00:15:04,676 --> 00:15:08,603
The Governor has declared a state of
emergency and alerted the National Guard.

237
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:12,732
Symptoms of the ailment include
slurred speech, wild movement,

238
00:15:12,851 --> 00:15:16,991
an appetite for human flesh,
and both slow and fast walking.

239
00:15:17,105 --> 00:15:21,910
If loved ones display these traits, isolate
them in a secure area and wait for help.

240
00:15:22,026 --> 00:15:24,281
"Loved ones". I gotta call Stacy.

241
00:15:24,404 --> 00:15:26,623
- Repeat message 5-B.
- Wait!

242
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:29,160
You guys broke up, right?

243
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:36,091
- I think I left my phone at the coffeshop.
- You went to a coffeeshop?

244
00:15:36,207 --> 00:15:38,971
I thought that you already had your coffee?

245
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:41,470
- That's very interesting.
- Can I use yours?

246
00:15:41,588 --> 00:15:45,301
Oh, boy! I think that I should
conserve battery power.

247
00:15:45,425 --> 00:15:46,718
Please.

248
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:48,100
Oh!

249
00:15:48,219 --> 00:15:50,355
Okay. Make it snappy.

250
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:52,607
Wait. Seriously, this is
what you use to call people?

251
00:15:52,724 --> 00:15:55,523
- Okay, listen, if you don't want to use it...
- No, no. It's fine.

252
00:15:55,643 --> 00:15:57,731
I just, uh...

253
00:15:57,854 --> 00:15:59,989
- Uh...
- You don't know her number?

254
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:02,610
No! I... Ssh! All right? I'm trying to think.

255
00:16:02,734 --> 00:16:05,533
The prospects for your relationship
are not looking good.

256
00:16:05,653 --> 00:16:08,038
I always just use speed dial, all right?
Everybody does that.

257
00:16:08,156 --> 00:16:09,709
Listen, no one is judging you.

258
00:16:09,824 --> 00:16:13,170
I'm just saying that when I care about someone,
I commit their phone number to memory.

259
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:14,876
Like my mom.

260
00:16:14,996 --> 00:16:19,293
Oh, shark, my mom!
Gimme-gimme-gimme-gimme-gimme!

261
00:16:26,007 --> 00:16:27,644
- Hello?
- Mom!

262
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,891
- Are there zombies there?
- Gotcha! You've reached my voicemail.

263
00:16:31,012 --> 00:16:33,812
- Please leave a message.
- Jesus, Mom, I hate this gag.

264
00:16:33,932 --> 00:16:35,937
Just kidding, it's actually me.

265
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:38,906
Oh, oh... Mom, are you really there?

266
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,448
Well, of course, little Miss Magoo.
Happy Fourth of July!

267
00:16:42,565 --> 00:16:45,531
Uh, have you been outside yet today?

268
00:16:45,652 --> 00:16:47,573
Why, yes, I was just down
at the Pick 'n Save.

269
00:16:47,695 --> 00:16:49,747
And are there people
eating other people's flesh?

270
00:16:49,864 --> 00:16:51,704
I'm in Virginia Beach, honey, not Florida.

271
00:16:51,824 --> 00:16:55,621
Mom, listen to me. The people here
are infected with something.

272
00:16:55,745 --> 00:16:58,130
I'm trying to get down there,
but if I don't make it...

273
00:16:59,207 --> 00:17:01,010
- ...take care of yourself.
- Deb?

274
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,679
- I love you.
- Are you there?

275
00:17:02,794 --> 00:17:04,799
- Ma?
- Can you hear me?

276
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:09,265
- Still using that janky old phon...
- Dammit!

277
00:17:17,183 --> 00:17:18,441
Mm.

278
00:17:21,938 --> 00:17:25,681
Okay, let's take stock of
what we have and, uh...

279
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:31,875
Board up the windows. Way ahead
of you, chief. Pee corner's over there.

280
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,952
That end table was a matching set! And we
don't need a pee corner, I've got a bathr...

281
00:17:36,077 --> 00:17:38,708
You know what? We're getting out of here.

282
00:17:40,832 --> 00:17:43,382
Help me!

283
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:51,264
All right, they're drawn to the noise.
We'll have to leave quietly.

284
00:17:51,384 --> 00:17:53,436
But... you heard the radio.

285
00:17:53,553 --> 00:17:57,065
They said to hunker down and wait for
the National Guard or, you know, whatever.

286
00:17:57,182 --> 00:17:59,436
And, just some food for thought,

287
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:02,987
we might want to start bonding
in case we have to repopulate the world.

288
00:18:03,104 --> 00:18:06,486
- Just thinking out loud here.
- No, please don't, all right?

289
00:18:06,608 --> 00:18:10,321
Look, my fiancÃ©e, brother and father
are out there. They'll be expecting me.

290
00:18:10,445 --> 00:18:13,707
Breaking news... people are kind of
foregoing their holiday plans right now.

291
00:18:13,823 --> 00:18:15,460
You'll be no help to them
if you get infected.

292
00:18:15,575 --> 00:18:18,921
I'd rather take that risk than be
without the people I care about.

293
00:18:19,037 --> 00:18:22,964
- Okay, whatever you want. I'm staying put.
- But I need you!

294
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:30,181
It's weird. I know that we've only known
each other a short time, but I kind of feel...

295
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:32,766
- You have a car.
- Oh?

296
00:18:32,884 --> 00:18:35,684
What happened to yours, player?
It's in the shop?

297
00:18:35,803 --> 00:18:38,188
I don't have one.
I ride my bicycle everywhere.

298
00:18:38,306 --> 00:18:41,438
Everywhere except across town in
the middle of a zombie apocalypse, huh?

299
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,529
- Is that your one exception?
- Look...

300
00:18:43,645 --> 00:18:46,325
Help me collect my people,
then we can all leave town together,

301
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:49,120
and then you can get to your mom in Virginia.

302
00:18:49,234 --> 00:18:50,954
Oh, I can't stay mad at you!

303
00:18:52,237 --> 00:18:54,407
We're gonna need some road snacks.

304
00:18:54,531 --> 00:18:57,414
Oh! I foolishly thought
that you kept food in here.

305
00:18:57,534 --> 00:19:01,591
- Hey, we can survive on this stuff!
- Oh, for an hour, if we were rabbits.

306
00:19:01,704 --> 00:19:04,670
Why do you have coconut water?
Is this Maine or Gilligan's Island?

307
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,259
It's very hydrating.

308
00:19:07,377 --> 00:19:10,971
Okay, once we get in that car,
I am not stopping till we get to VA.

309
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:13,557
There's gotta be some place
around here that we can get food.

310
00:19:13,675 --> 00:19:17,732
I check in on Mrs Jones,
get her groceries once in a while.

311
00:19:17,846 --> 00:19:20,064
Oh, that's so sweet!

312
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:23,898
Oh, no!

313
00:19:25,895 --> 00:19:27,781
Oh, my God! Is she...

314
00:19:30,233 --> 00:19:31,823
So sad!

315
00:19:31,943 --> 00:19:34,078
To die alone on the Fourth.

316
00:19:36,573 --> 00:19:38,245
Shadows are trailing.

317
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:40,169
My heart is bewailing.

318
00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:42,586
And tolling within like a funeral bell.

319
00:19:43,788 --> 00:19:46,007
Rest in peace, Mrs Jones.

320
00:19:49,502 --> 00:19:51,472
What are you doing?

321
00:19:51,588 --> 00:19:54,684
Oh, I was just reciting some Longfellow.
I think it's nice to say...

322
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,018
No, no. Why did you open her eyes?

323
00:19:57,135 --> 00:20:01,975
That's what you do when someone dies,
to let their soul rise up to heaven.

324
00:20:02,098 --> 00:20:05,361
What? No, no. You close their eyes.

325
00:20:05,476 --> 00:20:08,525
Uh, okay, trust me on this one!

326
00:20:08,646 --> 00:20:12,241
No. Trust me. Okay? Nobody does it that way.

327
00:20:12,358 --> 00:20:16,238
Uh, you're gonna feel pretty silly
when the internet's back up.

328
00:20:16,362 --> 00:20:20,669
Please! This was a sweet old lady,
all right? Don't be weird.

329
00:20:20,783 --> 00:20:22,586
Just leave her in peace.

330
00:20:22,702 --> 00:20:24,375
- I...
- Stop it!

331
00:20:24,495 --> 00:20:26,465
Ooh, taking control!

332
00:20:26,581 --> 00:20:30,128
Yeah, I dig it!
But I've gotta do right by her.

333
00:20:30,251 --> 00:20:32,470
Let your soul be free!

334
00:20:32,587 --> 00:20:35,552
- You're being ridiculous.
- No, you're being ridiculous!

335
00:20:35,673 --> 00:20:38,141
And let go of my wrist, you're hurting me.

336
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:41,392
- I'm not touching your... Whoa!
- What is happening?

337
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,738
- A little help here, chief!
- I'm working on it!

338
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,903
Okay, I'm sorry, Mrs Jones.

339
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,698
- I'm really sorry to do this to you.
- Forget the lamp, Martha Stewart!

340
00:20:52,815 --> 00:20:55,236
Okay! Okay, okay! Jump away!

341
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,910
All right! Now, and...

342
00:20:58,029 --> 00:20:59,666
- Clear!
- What are you doing?

343
00:20:59,781 --> 00:21:02,249
What? Why isn't it working?
Deb, do something!

344
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:05,084
Please don't struggle, Mrs Jones!

345
00:21:05,203 --> 00:21:07,089
Oh! She's old!

346
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:17,182
- Yeah!
- All right!

347
00:21:18,842 --> 00:21:22,021
I mean, that was a terrible, actually,
cos she was my neighbour.

348
00:21:22,136 --> 00:21:25,066
But that's, uh... Let's get the food.

349
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,671
These are the crappiest snacks.
Didn't this lady eat any solids?

350
00:21:39,195 --> 00:21:40,406
Whoa!

351
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,116
At least they're three floors down.

352
00:21:44,617 --> 00:21:47,583
Aah! Fire escape! Fire escape!

353
00:21:54,043 --> 00:21:56,013
Wait! Slow down!

354
00:21:56,129 --> 00:21:58,430
What are you doing?
You should've left all that stuff!

355
00:21:58,548 --> 00:22:00,885
- Sorry. Fine!
- No, no, no, don't just...

356
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:02,765
Sorry.

357
00:22:02,886 --> 00:22:04,060
Shit!

358
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:06,266
Great! Now look what you made me do.

359
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:13,939
Well, that's it. We're toast.

360
00:22:14,063 --> 00:22:16,531
It's stupid for us both to die.

361
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:20,661
- I'm gonna give you a chance.
- What are you talking about?

362
00:22:20,778 --> 00:22:21,822
Ssh!

363
00:22:21,946 --> 00:22:24,165
Earn this. Huh?

364
00:22:27,076 --> 00:22:29,331
- Come on.
- When the moment is right,

365
00:22:29,454 --> 00:22:31,293
you grab your bike and go!

366
00:22:31,414 --> 00:22:33,336
Who wants a piece of this?

367
00:22:46,262 --> 00:22:48,564
Why are you hitting yourself?
Why are you hitting yourself?

368
00:22:48,681 --> 00:22:50,936
Why are you hitting yourself?

369
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:53,278
Here, guys. I'm right here.

370
00:22:53,394 --> 00:22:55,400
Come on, you guys, get over here.

371
00:22:55,522 --> 00:22:57,906
Come on, you guys. I'm just right here.

372
00:22:58,024 --> 00:22:59,282
Hey!

373
00:23:06,157 --> 00:23:07,450
Whoa!

374
00:23:07,575 --> 00:23:08,749
Aah!

375
00:23:08,868 --> 00:23:11,917
That was awesome! You were awesome!

376
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:13,960
I feel so alive!

377
00:23:14,082 --> 00:23:16,169
- Tell me you have your keys.
- Yes!

378
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:28,390
You saved me, Ryan! You effing saved me!

379
00:23:28,513 --> 00:23:31,941
I think we can be pretty sure
that you like me.

380
00:23:32,058 --> 00:23:33,944
Good, God! Do you live in here?

381
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,448
No!

382
00:23:37,522 --> 00:23:39,112
Not any more.

383
00:23:39,232 --> 00:23:41,284
Maybe there's something more
about this on the radio.

384
00:23:41,401 --> 00:23:43,904
Don't you ever touch a black man's radio!

385
00:23:44,028 --> 00:23:46,365
It's Chris Tucker, Rush Hour.

386
00:23:46,489 --> 00:23:48,743
Radio's busted. Tape player works, though.

387
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:51,999
Oh, well, that's completely useless.

388
00:23:53,496 --> 00:23:55,003
Ten points!

389
00:23:55,123 --> 00:23:57,258
W-w-what are you doing?

390
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,012
I know! Low hanging fruit, right?

391
00:24:00,295 --> 00:24:02,264
Aah! No, no! Stop that.

392
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,844
Don't worry about it! This is like
swatting mosquitoes for little Otis.

393
00:24:05,967 --> 00:24:09,561
No, no! You can't just murder these zombies.
These are people.

394
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,064
Um... maybe they were once.

395
00:24:12,182 --> 00:24:14,946
No. For all we know, some chemist
could be working on a cure right now.

396
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:16,447
- They could be turned normal again.
- Sure!

397
00:24:16,561 --> 00:24:18,981
And maybe we can all hold hands
and skip to Yum-Yum Town,

398
00:24:19,105 --> 00:24:21,739
where rainbows shoot
out of the butts of unicorns.

399
00:24:21,858 --> 00:24:23,199
I'm serious.

400
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:27,581
Ryan, even if you're right,
would they really want to come back?

401
00:24:27,697 --> 00:24:31,577
How would you deal with the fact that you
just ate your roommate's lower intestine?

402
00:24:31,701 --> 00:24:34,418
Okay, okay. I wasn't looking on that one.

403
00:24:34,537 --> 00:24:36,044
Please, Deb.

404
00:24:40,627 --> 00:24:42,762
Enjoy your life, zombies.

405
00:24:48,676 --> 00:24:51,891
I always knew this town was dead,
but this is ridiculous.

406
00:24:52,013 --> 00:24:53,686
Cha-cha-cha!

407
00:24:53,806 --> 00:24:55,609
How many miles does this boat get?

408
00:24:55,725 --> 00:24:57,944
Oh, you're gonna bust on my car now?

409
00:24:58,061 --> 00:25:01,525
No, no, I was just thinking about
when we need to fill up the gas again.

410
00:25:01,648 --> 00:25:05,871
No, no, I hear it in your voice.
"Otis is offensive. Otis is unclean."

411
00:25:05,985 --> 00:25:10,043
Do you know, like, what the emissions from
this car actually do to the environment?

412
00:25:10,156 --> 00:25:13,205
I'm sorry, I must have missed
that page in Ryan's Guide To Being

413
00:25:13,326 --> 00:25:15,627
- A Completely Perfect Humanoid.
- No, no!

414
00:25:15,745 --> 00:25:19,423
It's not about being perfect.
Clean energy is just the right thing to do.

415
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:21,343
Energy is messy, okay.

416
00:25:21,459 --> 00:25:26,098
I mean, it's really cute to eat organic millet
and drive around in a hovercraft or whatever,

417
00:25:26,214 --> 00:25:28,219
but look around you, dude.

418
00:25:28,341 --> 00:25:31,723
We lost. We tried to save the planet
and this is where it got us.

419
00:25:31,845 --> 00:25:34,977
- God, you sound just like my dad.
- Really?

420
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:37,518
The guy sounds awesome.
What are you, adopted?

421
00:25:37,642 --> 00:25:42,482
That's good. Nice one. That's actually the
family joke. My brother makes it all the time.

422
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:49,723
It's a good one. Look, I'm sorry.
My family is not a Hallmark card either.

423
00:25:51,406 --> 00:25:53,577
I remember every Fourth,

424
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,757
my dad would bring us all up to the roof
to watch fireworks over the eastern prom.

425
00:25:57,871 --> 00:26:02,841
And then, one year, around dusk,
the guy's nowhere to be found.

426
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:07,016
So we go up to the roof
and that's when we saw him.

427
00:26:08,965 --> 00:26:12,180
He was lying there in the backyard,

428
00:26:12,302 --> 00:26:14,888
right by the barbecue.

429
00:26:15,013 --> 00:26:17,065
He almost looked like he was asleep.

430
00:26:19,517 --> 00:26:23,777
He was changing out the propane tank.
It was the best cookout ever.

431
00:26:26,316 --> 00:26:28,403
- That's the end of the story?
- Mm-hm.

432
00:26:28,526 --> 00:26:31,243
That's a ridiculous... That was so strange.

433
00:26:31,362 --> 00:26:33,699
- It's all going one direction and then...
- But that was a good memory.

434
00:26:33,823 --> 00:26:35,875
It's not all like that.

435
00:26:35,992 --> 00:26:37,914
It's a mixed bag.

436
00:26:38,036 --> 00:26:40,372
Okay, well, anyway, um...

437
00:26:41,456 --> 00:26:44,884
My dad is pissed because
I won't work for the family business.

438
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:46,555
Really? What's wrong with it?

439
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:50,596
It's rated the most environmentally
unsound business in the state.

440
00:26:50,715 --> 00:26:53,396
Waverly Water Treatment?

441
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,930
You're a Waverly? Oh, my God!

442
00:26:56,054 --> 00:26:59,186
- How did you put that together?
- Because I work in the news, remember?

443
00:26:59,307 --> 00:27:03,816
Don't get me wrong, that company seems like
pure evil but the buckage must be pretty good.

444
00:27:03,937 --> 00:27:07,899
Yeah, well, not for me. I'm not gonna
work there, so my brother's gonna get it all.

445
00:27:08,024 --> 00:27:10,159
Mm, tough break.

446
00:27:10,276 --> 00:27:12,613
Where the fuck are we?

447
00:27:13,947 --> 00:27:15,749
Wait. What are you doing?

448
00:27:15,865 --> 00:27:18,001
Just gotta stop in here.

449
00:27:21,955 --> 00:27:24,885
Yule Mart? No, no, we agreed.

450
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:27,680
No more stopping. My dad's place
is just a couple of miles up the road.

451
00:27:27,794 --> 00:27:31,970
Yeah, and we're gonna get there. But my
friend's inside. I have to see if she's okay.

452
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:34,177
Fine. Five minutes.

453
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,720
Do we have anything deadlier
than a bike chain?

454
00:27:37,804 --> 00:27:38,896
Uh...

455
00:27:39,013 --> 00:27:40,686
This... thing.

456
00:27:40,807 --> 00:27:41,851
No.

457
00:27:41,975 --> 00:27:44,194
Oh, check the glove box.

458
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:50,319
Maybe that?

459
00:27:53,194 --> 00:27:56,540
You've had a gun this entire time?

460
00:27:56,656 --> 00:27:59,753
Yeah, it was in there when I bought the car.

461
00:27:59,868 --> 00:28:03,082
It's mostly for show, though,
it only has two bullets.

462
00:28:03,204 --> 00:28:06,004
If it comes down to it,
we'll use it to tap out.

463
00:28:06,124 --> 00:28:08,259
- "Tap out"?
- Yeah.

464
00:28:08,376 --> 00:28:10,713
You know, if we get infected.

465
00:28:10,837 --> 00:28:12,759
Tap. Poof!

466
00:28:12,881 --> 00:28:15,182
And then tap. Poof!

467
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,601
You just shot yourself first.

468
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:21,480
Oh, I'm sorry, Ryan! I haven't worked out
the math on our murder-suicide yet!

469
00:28:21,598 --> 00:28:23,816
Okay, let me be really clear about this.

470
00:28:23,933 --> 00:28:26,104
I do not want to be tapped out.

471
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,991
Right, you say that now!

472
00:28:29,105 --> 00:28:33,067
No, seriously, if I get infected, just let me
run off into the woods or something.

473
00:28:33,193 --> 00:28:36,491
You'll feel differently when you get
infected. I don't want you to suffer.

474
00:28:36,613 --> 00:28:40,290
No, I could not be more sure about this.
I do not want you to shoot me in the head.

475
00:28:40,408 --> 00:28:43,125
Sure, sure, sure. Okay, okay.
We'll see, though.

476
00:28:43,244 --> 00:28:44,336
Okay?

477
00:28:50,168 --> 00:28:51,758
Stay alert.

478
00:28:54,881 --> 00:28:57,680
# Jingle bells, jingle bells...

479
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:01,274
# Oh, what fun it is to ride... #

480
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:14,119
# Deck the halls with... #

481
00:29:17,695 --> 00:29:20,828
- Look at all this crap.
- You don't like Christmas?

482
00:29:20,949 --> 00:29:23,832
Are you kidding, me?
I freakin' love Christmas.

483
00:29:23,952 --> 00:29:27,629
Which is why I think these plastic trees
are for Tyre stores and...

484
00:29:27,747 --> 00:29:29,669
communists.

485
00:29:29,791 --> 00:29:33,718
When I have kids, I'm gonna take them
every year to cut down a real tree.

486
00:29:33,837 --> 00:29:36,802
You realise it takes ten years
for one of those trees to grow

487
00:29:36,923 --> 00:29:38,679
and only seconds to saw the life out of it?

488
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,481
If there's a bigger buzz-kill than you, sir,
I do not know what that looks like.

489
00:29:41,594 --> 00:29:44,892
I'm just saying that we should celebrate
planting a tree with the children,

490
00:29:45,014 --> 00:29:46,568
rather than destroying one.

491
00:29:46,683 --> 00:29:48,071
"We"?

492
00:29:48,184 --> 00:29:50,735
- Yeah, you know. I mean, people, Earth.
- A-huh.

493
00:29:50,854 --> 00:29:52,360
But you said "the children".

494
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,485
If you meant children in general,
you would've said something like...

495
00:29:54,607 --> 00:29:56,328
Oh, my God!

496
00:29:56,442 --> 00:29:58,448
That sweater!

497
00:30:01,322 --> 00:30:02,746
Ruby?

498
00:30:02,866 --> 00:30:05,250
Honey, are you okay?

499
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,876
Look out!

500
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:15,004
Well, it looks like she's
full-on zombie, let's jet.

501
00:30:15,128 --> 00:30:18,615
- Wait! We can't leave her like that.
- What do you suggest?

502
00:30:19,257 --> 00:30:22,894
- Tap, tap.
- Use our bullets on her?

503
00:30:23,011 --> 00:30:25,894
It's the right thing to do. Besides,
you said you don't want to use them.

504
00:30:26,014 --> 00:30:27,307
But the gun's in the car.

505
00:30:31,102 --> 00:30:32,490
Here.

506
00:30:32,604 --> 00:30:34,656
You distract her and lead her outside.

507
00:30:34,772 --> 00:30:36,445
I'll do the rest.

508
00:30:39,152 --> 00:30:40,326
Hey!

509
00:30:40,445 --> 00:30:42,913
Sale on flesh over here!

510
00:30:44,574 --> 00:30:45,867
Ruby?

511
00:30:51,414 --> 00:30:52,506
Deb!

512
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:56,881
- What's going on?
- Get on the roof! Trust me!

513
00:30:57,003 --> 00:30:59,055
I don't trust you!

514
00:31:07,847 --> 00:31:09,520
Yahtzee!

515
00:31:12,143 --> 00:31:14,647
Did I hurt you in a past life or something?

516
00:31:14,771 --> 00:31:18,199
I just thought maybe you're right.
Maybe they'll find a cure for this some day.

517
00:31:18,316 --> 00:31:19,988
- Well, if I can change one mind.
- Hey...

518
00:31:20,109 --> 00:31:23,452
You saved a zombie, kid,
you didn't undo apartheid.

519
00:31:24,989 --> 00:31:27,493
Okay, let's go find your peeps.

520
00:31:27,617 --> 00:31:29,587
Hang in there, Rubs.

521
00:31:29,702 --> 00:31:31,754
It's up here on the right.

522
00:31:34,874 --> 00:31:37,888
Good. That's Stacy's car.
I'm glad she knew to come here.

523
00:31:38,002 --> 00:31:41,466
Yay! So glad Stacy isn't dead.

524
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:44,852
Look, Deb, I hope this isn't going to...

525
00:31:44,968 --> 00:31:46,605
Are you out of your mind?

526
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:49,021
What? We both agreed we're
not going to leave this car again.

527
00:31:49,138 --> 00:31:52,602
Until we get here, yeah! Obviously,
we have to get out to collect them.

528
00:31:52,725 --> 00:31:55,490
- We don't even know if they're in there.
- Trust me, they are.

529
00:31:55,603 --> 00:31:58,617
We always get together on the Fourth.
It's my dad's favourite holiday.

530
00:31:58,731 --> 00:32:01,745
Well, prepare yourself.
They may not be the people you remember.

531
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,490
Oh, I have no doubt they'll be
unrelenting flesh-eating monsters,

532
00:32:05,613 --> 00:32:08,579
but I bet they won't be zombies. Okay.

533
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,797
I deserve the things I want.
My needs are worthwhile.

534
00:32:11,911 --> 00:32:15,008
I'm not hurting anyone by being myself.

535
00:32:15,123 --> 00:32:17,709
What are you doing, Rain Man?

536
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:21,630
I like to take a second to centre
myself every time I come here.

537
00:32:21,754 --> 00:32:25,812
I deserve the things I want.
My needs are worthwhile.

538
00:32:25,925 --> 00:32:29,140
- I'm not hurting anyone by being myself.
- Uh, uh... I want to be supportive, an' all,

539
00:32:29,262 --> 00:32:31,812
but is this mantra much longer?

540
00:32:37,677 --> 00:32:41,408
- Oh, man! What is it again?
- Well, why don't you try Stacy's phone number.

541
00:32:41,524 --> 00:32:46,199
Will you just give it a rest, all right?
You're like the Terminator of sarcasm.

542
00:32:46,321 --> 00:32:49,251
I drove you here, in my car,

543
00:32:49,365 --> 00:32:53,755
and you've been treating me like I'm just a bag
of wet diapers that you have to lug around.

544
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:57,298
Well, that actually sounds less shitty
than whatever we've got going on now.

545
00:32:57,415 --> 00:33:01,638
Oh, wow! You know, I thought that
you were a cool guy back at the bar,

546
00:33:01,753 --> 00:33:04,766
but now I find out you're
some spoiled pretty boy.

547
00:33:04,881 --> 00:33:09,104
Excuse me, "pretty boy"? I have
a very masculine set of features, okay?

548
00:33:09,219 --> 00:33:11,520
If anything, my look is "burnished rugged".

549
00:33:11,638 --> 00:33:13,477
Nobody who is that says that!

550
00:33:13,598 --> 00:33:16,232
- I do.
- Your hair has not moved this entire time!

551
00:33:16,351 --> 00:33:19,031
It's thick, it requires maintenance.
You have no idea!

552
00:33:19,145 --> 00:33:22,242
You haven't taken a shower since
yesterday and yet you still smell

553
00:33:22,357 --> 00:33:24,077
like sandalwood and lilac!

554
00:33:24,192 --> 00:33:29,365
Oh, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to distract you
from being the weirdest person in the world!

555
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,174
God, Chaz!

556
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:36,375
- Did you change the gate code?
- Depends.

557
00:33:36,496 --> 00:33:41,336
- How do I know you're not... one of them?
- Because I'm speaking in words.

558
00:33:42,627 --> 00:33:44,679
- What about her?
- Gimme a break, Chaz!

559
00:33:44,796 --> 00:33:47,133
Hi, I'm Deb.

560
00:33:48,925 --> 00:33:51,725
- Will you knock it off?
- You're Ryan's big brother?

561
00:33:51,845 --> 00:33:54,728
- You're so... different.
- Thanks. We think he's adopted.

562
00:33:54,848 --> 00:33:56,105
Oh, that never gets old.

563
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:59,072
Can we please come in?
We've had really a long day.

564
00:33:59,185 --> 00:34:02,732
So, wait, excuse me, wait.
What are you? Are you the rebound?

565
00:34:02,856 --> 00:34:04,825
Oh, busted!

566
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:08,405
How did you know, dude?
You're probably an uncle now.

567
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,875
- No! No, no, that's not...
- I knew it!

568
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:13,829
- Stacy's here, right?
- Oh!

569
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:16,999
She told me all about your big breakup, stud.

570
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,089
Looks like you didn't waste
much time moving on now, did you?

571
00:34:19,205 --> 00:34:21,756
No, that's not...
We're just helping each other.

572
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:23,714
I'm sure you are. Huh!

573
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:27,553
Deb, I'm Chaz.

574
00:34:27,672 --> 00:34:31,227
Clearly the more masculine
of the two Waverly brothers.

575
00:34:32,243 --> 00:34:34,479
- Good shot.
- I aim to please.

576
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:37,942
Okay! Open the gate!

577
00:34:38,057 --> 00:34:40,193
- You need the code, man.
- Okay.

578
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,066
- Do you want it?
- Yes!

579
00:34:42,187 --> 00:34:45,900
Okay, it's five, eight, zero, zero eight.

580
00:34:46,024 --> 00:34:48,195
That's... It's "BOOBS" upside down.

581
00:34:48,318 --> 00:34:50,489
- Wow!
- Yeah.

582
00:34:50,612 --> 00:34:53,245
A gentleman, too! Ooh-Ia-Ia!

583
00:34:53,364 --> 00:34:56,057
Thank you, Chaz.

584
00:34:59,996 --> 00:35:01,835
Oh! Shoot!

585
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:04,584
Dad?

586
00:35:04,709 --> 00:35:08,422
Whoa! This is, like,
straight out of Mitchell Black!

587
00:35:08,546 --> 00:35:11,560
Ryan! Oh, my Rye-bread, you're all right.

588
00:35:11,674 --> 00:35:14,308
- We thought for sure...
- No, no, I'm... I'm okay.

589
00:35:14,427 --> 00:35:17,310
Hey, Stacy, did you meet Deb?
She came here with Ryan, together.

590
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:21,606
- Where did you creep up from?
- Oh, I just... came with Rye-bread.

591
00:35:21,726 --> 00:35:23,612
They helped each other get across town.

592
00:35:23,728 --> 00:35:25,899
God knows what they had to do
to survive. Isn't that swell?

593
00:35:26,022 --> 00:35:27,825
So helpful.

594
00:35:27,941 --> 00:35:30,112
- Do we tip her or...
- It was nothing.

595
00:35:30,235 --> 00:35:35,585
It was just one hand stroking the other.
Friends with benefits, as they say.

596
00:35:35,698 --> 00:35:37,252
- I'm glad you made it.
- Oh!

597
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:39,039
Dad! Dad, look...

598
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,506
I've been thinking, I'm really sorry for
what I said on the phone last night.

599
00:35:42,622 --> 00:35:44,461
I've been thinking all day and I was worried

600
00:35:44,582 --> 00:35:46,587
those would be the last words
we ever said to each other.

601
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:50,932
Could I see you in the kitchen for a moment?
I need a little help with my brownies.

602
00:35:51,047 --> 00:35:53,135
Mr Waverly? Hi.

603
00:35:53,258 --> 00:35:54,385
Hi.

604
00:35:58,429 --> 00:36:00,814
I always help him with the brownies.

605
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:04,697
- Hey, Deb, how much you bench?
- Right now?

606
00:36:04,811 --> 00:36:07,065
- Yeah.
- Forty?

607
00:36:07,188 --> 00:36:09,276
How could you be so boneheaded?

608
00:36:09,399 --> 00:36:12,578
- Stacy's here. She's not family.
- Stacy's inner circle.

609
00:36:12,694 --> 00:36:14,865
She's been here since last night,
for God's sake.

610
00:36:14,988 --> 00:36:16,708
- She has?
- The point is,

611
00:36:16,823 --> 00:36:18,543
I spoke with the Governor on the shortwave.

612
00:36:18,658 --> 00:36:22,834
He's arranged a chopper evac at
the county line at 0900 hours tomorrow.

613
00:36:22,954 --> 00:36:27,130
- For the four of us, not five.
- I'm sure Deb can squeeze in.

614
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:31,177
Oh! You're a big man
now all of a sudden, huh?

615
00:36:31,296 --> 00:36:34,060
Why did I not get the memo?

616
00:36:34,174 --> 00:36:36,510
Well, this is bigger than you are, smart guy!

617
00:36:36,634 --> 00:36:38,722
And you'd know that if you'd
listened on the phone last night,

618
00:36:38,845 --> 00:36:41,016
instead of blathering on
about your principles.

619
00:36:41,139 --> 00:36:46,228
Wait, so you knew last night that
people were gonna turn into zombies?

620
00:36:46,352 --> 00:36:49,033
No, no, no, no.

621
00:36:49,147 --> 00:36:51,946
These people aren't... what you said.

622
00:36:52,066 --> 00:36:54,570
They're just ordinary citizens,

623
00:36:54,694 --> 00:36:57,375
who happen to have contracted

624
00:36:57,488 --> 00:37:01,546
a parasite-borne virus that makes
their corporal bodies decompose

625
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:03,961
and gives them an insatiable
appetite for human flesh.

626
00:37:04,078 --> 00:37:07,377
Oh, my God! The water.

627
00:37:07,498 --> 00:37:11,461
Now, Ryan, come on,
it's just a very complicated situation.

628
00:37:11,586 --> 00:37:14,434
All right? We haven't got our arms
around all the details yet.

629
00:37:14,547 --> 00:37:16,635
Well, get your arms around this,
Deb's coming with us!

630
00:37:16,758 --> 00:37:20,104
- That's not an option.
- If you leave her out, I go too.

631
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,897
I promised her I would get her out of town
and I'm keeping that promise.

632
00:37:32,273 --> 00:37:33,531
Mm!

633
00:37:34,943 --> 00:37:38,039
- You can't talk, Stacy, while I'm shooting.
- I didn't.

634
00:37:38,154 --> 00:37:41,618
So you're saying people became zombies
last night if they drank the city water?

635
00:37:41,741 --> 00:37:44,209
Or bathed in it,
which explains how you were spared.

636
00:37:44,327 --> 00:37:46,664
Stacy, Deb is my guest. Please!

637
00:37:46,788 --> 00:37:51,545
I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just going by
the look of her hair and face and clothes.

638
00:37:51,668 --> 00:37:56,591
But, Ryan, you take a shower, like,
every ten minutes. Why didn't you turn?

639
00:37:56,714 --> 00:37:58,186
Unless...

640
00:37:58,299 --> 00:38:00,435
I think I'm gonna be sick.

641
00:38:00,552 --> 00:38:02,023
Hi-ooh!

642
00:38:02,136 --> 00:38:06,313
- Longest walk of shame ever!
- No, no! That's not...

643
00:38:06,432 --> 00:38:08,651
Nothing happened, we both just passed out.

644
00:38:08,768 --> 00:38:12,280
- I mean, something happened.
- I'm sure it did!

645
00:38:12,397 --> 00:38:17,534
While you two were getting gross with each
other, I took care of Stacy and her pussy cats.

646
00:38:17,652 --> 00:38:18,826
Ryan...

647
00:38:20,029 --> 00:38:22,959
You were right and I was wrong.

648
00:38:23,074 --> 00:38:26,503
I have decided to keep the nutmeg in.

649
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:30,131
- Oh, I'm glad you see it that way.
- Mm-hm.

650
00:38:30,248 --> 00:38:35,172
Nutmeg can be a bit much at times,
but that's no reason to abandon it.

651
00:38:35,295 --> 00:38:38,509
You guys are what, trading recipes now?
And when did that start happening?

652
00:38:38,631 --> 00:38:40,719
Chaz, will you just give
your ears a rest, please?

653
00:38:40,842 --> 00:38:43,974
- Okay, yeah.
- The important thing is, we're safe.

654
00:38:44,095 --> 00:38:46,396
We're all safe!

655
00:38:46,514 --> 00:38:49,480
Oh! Holy frijoles!

656
00:38:49,601 --> 00:38:50,894
Oh, man!

657
00:38:51,019 --> 00:38:55,408
Topper? You still have that
giant boozehound on the payroll?

658
00:38:55,523 --> 00:38:56,650
Hi, Ryan.

659
00:38:56,774 --> 00:39:01,579
That giant boozehound saved your privileged
little ass numerous times when you were a boy.

660
00:39:01,696 --> 00:39:04,709
Topper, just keep walking the
perimeter or no brownie for you.

661
00:39:04,824 --> 00:39:07,707
Yeah, like when Leah Schiffer
discovered me at hide-and-seek

662
00:39:07,827 --> 00:39:10,710
and got put in the hospital?
She didn't walk right ever again.

663
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:15,172
Leah didn't play by the rules.
Society crumbles without rules.

664
00:39:15,293 --> 00:39:17,713
- Amen, Pop.
- And speaking of crumbling...

665
00:39:17,837 --> 00:39:20,803
I'm pretty sure my brownies
must be cool enough by now.

666
00:39:20,924 --> 00:39:23,392
Shall we all adjourn to the living room?

667
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,764
Leah Schiffer!

668
00:39:25,887 --> 00:39:29,767
Easy does it there. Mmm!

669
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:32,856
Will you look at that, huh?

670
00:39:32,977 --> 00:39:34,021
Sorry, I...

671
00:39:34,145 --> 00:39:36,649
I'm still stuck on this water thing.

672
00:39:36,773 --> 00:39:39,952
It's boring stuff, dear,
a little bit too technical.

673
00:39:40,068 --> 00:39:44,789
Does it have to do with the ultraviolet treatment
process that you're testing at Waverly Water?

674
00:39:44,906 --> 00:39:48,500
What? No. Not according to public record.

675
00:39:48,618 --> 00:39:51,583
Where did you ever hear
such a preposterous fabrication?

676
00:39:52,956 --> 00:39:55,927
I keep my ear to the ground for my job.

677
00:39:56,042 --> 00:39:58,593
Deb Clarington, News Channel Seven.

678
00:39:58,711 --> 00:40:03,717
Your system is supposed to cut the cost
of purifying our water by half, right?

679
00:40:03,842 --> 00:40:07,021
That's... brilliant and ambitious.

680
00:40:07,136 --> 00:40:10,185
Well, yes, it was supposed to be
a boon for the entire town.

681
00:40:10,306 --> 00:40:13,272
And we could sell the surplus
to the bottling companies.

682
00:40:13,393 --> 00:40:17,616
But weren't you supposed
to still be in beta on the process?

683
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:18,822
We... we were.

684
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,870
Then... why the rush, Frank?

685
00:40:21,985 --> 00:40:25,247
I told the Governor that we needed more time,

686
00:40:25,363 --> 00:40:29,160
that the pre-filters weren't
catching all of the bio-pathogens yet.

687
00:40:29,284 --> 00:40:33,127
But he... he insisted that we
roll it out before the holidays,

688
00:40:33,246 --> 00:40:35,714
so he could squeeze it into the Q2 budget.

689
00:40:35,832 --> 00:40:38,466
And by "insisted," I'm sure you
mean he gave you a huge kickback.

690
00:40:38,585 --> 00:40:42,642
How were we supposed to know it was going
to be a banner year for the Ichabod virus?

691
00:40:42,755 --> 00:40:46,101
The same thing that wiped out
the indigenous Wabanaki Indians?

692
00:40:46,217 --> 00:40:49,396
- Wobanaki Indians, Pop.
- Wobanaki Indians.

693
00:40:49,512 --> 00:40:53,605
I'm supposed to be proud of you that you
wiped out the entire population of our town?

694
00:40:53,725 --> 00:40:55,481
You see that? You always go to the negative.

695
00:40:55,602 --> 00:40:56,776
- I'm proud of you. Pop.
- Always!

696
00:40:56,895 --> 00:40:58,401
Population or no population.

697
00:40:58,521 --> 00:41:02,946
Oh, come on, relax now, babe.
We've got some catching up to do! Hm-hm!

698
00:41:03,067 --> 00:41:06,531
Okay. Well, jeez, it's been a hoot.

699
00:41:06,654 --> 00:41:10,000
- But I think I need to skedaddle down the road.
- No, Deb, wait!

700
00:41:10,116 --> 00:41:13,829
- Why, right?
- You can't go back out there.

701
00:41:13,953 --> 00:41:16,801
My dad arranged a helicopter
for us in the morning.

702
00:41:16,915 --> 00:41:19,963
Plus, you must be exhausted.
We hardly slept last night.

703
00:41:20,084 --> 00:41:24,011
You know those times when you can taste
your own stomach acid? I have that right now.

704
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:28,520
- I know what you mean.
- I'm going to be just fine, chief.

705
00:41:28,635 --> 00:41:33,391
This was the deal. We got you here,
now I'm going to get on to my own family.

706
00:41:33,515 --> 00:41:36,813
So... thanks for the mammaries.

707
00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:42,134
Nobody's going anywhere!

708
00:41:42,815 --> 00:41:45,864
Till they taste one of my freedom brownies!

709
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:49,119
- Chaz. Give this to Topper.
- I got it, Pop.

710
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:51,244
For close-range kills.

711
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:56,088
Stay.

712
00:41:56,204 --> 00:42:02,219
The brownies are a Fourth of July tradition
that we started when Ryan's mother was alive.

713
00:42:02,335 --> 00:42:06,132
- You remind me of her, in a way.
- I think we did that, like, twice.

714
00:42:06,256 --> 00:42:09,684
- If it means that much to you, of course.
- Yes.

715
00:42:11,594 --> 00:42:12,603
Oh!

716
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,013
Mm?

717
00:42:15,181 --> 00:42:17,505
Gosh! That is...

718
00:42:18,142 --> 00:42:19,982
...so good.

719
00:42:20,103 --> 00:42:23,068
I'm surprised Chaz hasn't added
creatine to his brownie yet.

720
00:42:23,189 --> 00:42:25,775
Hey! I'm just trying
to stay strong for all of us.

721
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:29,163
What are you gonna do when
the shit hits the fan? Huh, little brother?

722
00:42:29,279 --> 00:42:31,782
Are you going to come out with your
hair-dryer, is that what you're gonna do?

723
00:42:31,906 --> 00:42:34,077
- Huh, little brother?
- Whoa!

724
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,754
- Stop it!
- Hey, hey!

725
00:42:35,869 --> 00:42:38,289
Stop it! Get off me!

726
00:42:38,413 --> 00:42:40,382
Get off me!

727
00:42:40,498 --> 00:42:42,717
You guys are acting worse
than those things out there.

728
00:42:42,834 --> 00:42:45,799
Oh, I thought they were just ordinary
citizens who got a little wet.

729
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,633
- Oh, shut up, you little piss-ant.
- Pop, I got it!

730
00:42:49,757 --> 00:42:51,679
Come on, you numbskulls, you idiots!

731
00:42:51,801 --> 00:42:54,435
- If your mother... Stop it!
- I got him!

732
00:42:54,554 --> 00:42:56,144
- I can't get up!
- I got him!

733
00:42:56,264 --> 00:42:59,396
- He's trapped!
- Through the night rode Paul Revere.

734
00:42:59,517 --> 00:43:03,361
And so through the night
went his cry of alarm.

735
00:43:03,479 --> 00:43:06,943
Through every Middlesex village and farm

736
00:43:07,066 --> 00:43:09,368
a cry of defiance

737
00:43:09,485 --> 00:43:11,573
and not of fear.

738
00:43:11,696 --> 00:43:15,919
- What the bejeezus was that?
- That was Longfellow. Deb's favourite.

739
00:43:16,034 --> 00:43:19,711
Ah, Longfellow. You know,
he's from here. Maine. Portland.

740
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:23,673
You know, maybe it's not my place, but...

741
00:43:23,791 --> 00:43:26,128
you guys are with family.

742
00:43:26,252 --> 00:43:28,507
We're lucky we're even alive.

743
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:30,765
You see that, boys?

744
00:43:30,882 --> 00:43:35,188
The little redhead's right.
It's the Fourth of July, for God's sake.

745
00:43:35,303 --> 00:43:37,308
You're right. Yeah.

746
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:39,518
Let's blow some shit up. Yeah?

747
00:43:39,641 --> 00:43:41,313
Yeah?

748
00:43:44,896 --> 00:43:46,319
Wait for it.

749
00:43:46,439 --> 00:43:48,160
- Wait for it.
- Yeah.

750
00:43:48,274 --> 00:43:50,611
- Here comes the good part. There it is.
- Oh, wow!

751
00:43:50,735 --> 00:43:52,657
Check that out!

752
00:43:52,779 --> 00:43:54,072
- That's great.
- Sweet!

753
00:43:54,197 --> 00:43:58,289
Up next, I got a big aerial display. It explodes
and then a roaring bear face comes out.

754
00:43:58,409 --> 00:44:01,838
No, no, no. That's enough.
We don't want to attract too much attention.

755
00:44:01,955 --> 00:44:04,505
What? Dad, I got, like, all these M80's.

756
00:44:04,624 --> 00:44:08,136
- You don't want to see the bear face?
- No! No, I do not.

757
00:44:08,878 --> 00:44:10,673
I shouldn't let you do this one.

758
00:44:10,797 --> 00:44:14,593
Okay, everybody, drink up. I'm gonna turn in.

759
00:44:14,717 --> 00:44:17,850
We have to have our wits
about us in the morning, so...

760
00:44:17,971 --> 00:44:19,561
- Ooh, quick question.
- Yeah.

761
00:44:19,681 --> 00:44:21,732
Where's everybody sleeping?

762
00:44:22,725 --> 00:44:26,320
Well, Ryan and Stacy
will stay in Ryan's old room,

763
00:44:26,437 --> 00:44:30,495
and Deborah over there...
How you doing there, hon?

764
00:44:30,608 --> 00:44:32,863
- I'm fine.
- Okay!

765
00:44:32,986 --> 00:44:35,121
She's going to be in your room, all right?

766
00:44:35,238 --> 00:44:38,168
And you're going to stand watch with Topper.

767
00:44:38,283 --> 00:44:40,252
- Come on, walk with me.
- Hm!

768
00:44:40,368 --> 00:44:42,622
- Walk with me, Chaz. Come!
- Hm!

769
00:44:45,206 --> 00:44:46,796
Come on.

770
00:44:48,084 --> 00:44:51,347
- I'm so glad that you're safe, babe.
- Yeah.

771
00:44:51,462 --> 00:44:52,934
Thanks.

772
00:44:59,971 --> 00:45:02,522
I'm gonna need your help
with Ryan in the morning.

773
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,069
- How do you mean?
- His new friend isn't coming with us.

774
00:45:06,186 --> 00:45:09,069
- The adorable little ginger girl?
- I'm sure he'll throw a hissy fit.

775
00:45:09,189 --> 00:45:11,241
How are we gonna sneak out without her?

776
00:45:11,357 --> 00:45:15,664
I put enough horse tranquilizer in that
brownie to kept her asleep through August.

777
00:45:15,778 --> 00:45:18,199
I'm surprised she's even still on her feet!

778
00:45:18,323 --> 00:45:21,206
I'm sure she'll be going down
for the count soon.

779
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:25,253
Hey, don't go soft on me now, boy!

780
00:45:25,371 --> 00:45:29,547
She works for the news. We don't want her
doing some story on the water supply.

781
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:30,841
Uh-uh.

782
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,469
Sometimes... you gotta put
your own oxygen mask on first.

783
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,305
Put my oxygen mask on first.

784
00:45:39,427 --> 00:45:40,898
- Right, first.
- Ow!

785
00:45:41,012 --> 00:45:42,649
All right.

786
00:45:43,723 --> 00:45:45,645
- Uh, Chaz...
- Yeah, Pop.

787
00:45:45,767 --> 00:45:47,320
Stop trying to bang Stacy.

788
00:45:47,435 --> 00:45:51,066
- Once was enough.
- If only it was!

789
00:45:51,189 --> 00:45:54,535
Oh! Don't you tell me
you're falling in love with her?

790
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:57,616
Ryan's back. Be realistic.

791
00:45:57,737 --> 00:46:02,412
What? Is it totally unrealistic to think
that I could be the special one for once?

792
00:46:02,534 --> 00:46:06,045
I mean, what's he got that I don't got?
Besides your great eyes.

793
00:46:06,162 --> 00:46:08,214
- We gotta stay focused, boy.
- A-ha.

794
00:46:08,331 --> 00:46:09,754
- You hear me? Stay focused.
- Okay!

795
00:46:09,874 --> 00:46:12,175
We got to keep our shit straight
if we're gonna make it through this thing.

796
00:46:12,293 --> 00:46:14,215
- Yeah, keep our shit straight.
- Keep it straight.

797
00:46:14,337 --> 00:46:16,556
Keep it straight. Thanks, Pop!

798
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:18,345
- Thanks for the rap.
- Okay.

799
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:20,851
Okay.

800
00:46:20,969 --> 00:46:24,231
Okay! All right, you'd better
get back to your post.

801
00:46:24,347 --> 00:46:25,474
Okay.

802
00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:45,452
"Portland's water runs through him."
Oh! Gross!

803
00:46:49,956 --> 00:46:52,424
I think you can forgo your sit-ups tonight.

804
00:46:55,086 --> 00:46:57,138
I'll give you a workout.

805
00:46:57,255 --> 00:46:58,548
Wow!

806
00:46:58,673 --> 00:47:00,429
Uh, Stacy...

807
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:02,887
I'm talking about sex.

808
00:47:03,011 --> 00:47:05,146
No, I know. Um...

809
00:47:05,263 --> 00:47:07,944
I'm going to sleep here on floor, all right?
You take the bed.

810
00:47:08,057 --> 00:47:12,317
- A lot's happened since you broke up with me.
- Are you gonna keep throwing that in my face?

811
00:47:12,437 --> 00:47:17,241
No. Hey, look, we need to talk, all right?
I think you were right to dump me.

812
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:19,448
Ryan, you need to stop being a martyr, okay?

813
00:47:19,569 --> 00:47:22,950
This is a sure thing. Just relax.

814
00:47:23,072 --> 00:47:25,327
No, wait! I... I... I'm...

815
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:27,786
I'm saying we want different things.

816
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:30,959
Oh, really? And what do you want? That nerd?

817
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,094
- Could you keep your voice down?
- Well, what does she do for you, Ryan?

818
00:47:34,209 --> 00:47:38,385
She ride you like this? Like...
Oh, yeah! Oh, Ryan, you're the best!

819
00:47:38,505 --> 00:47:41,553
Oh, yes! Oh, Ryan! Oh, yes!

820
00:47:41,674 --> 00:47:45,186
- Cut it out!
- Oh, yeah, Ryan! Oh! Oh, yeah!

821
00:47:45,303 --> 00:47:46,857
Oh, yeah!

822
00:47:46,971 --> 00:47:49,901
Oh, yes! Oh, Ryan!

823
00:47:50,016 --> 00:47:52,602
- Oh, yes, you're the best!
- Cut it out, please!

824
00:47:52,727 --> 00:47:54,898
Oh... Oh, yeah!

825
00:47:55,021 --> 00:47:57,073
Oh, Ryan! Oh, yeah!

826
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:00,287
- Yeah, Ryan! I shop at Target!
- Cut it out. Ssh!

827
00:48:00,401 --> 00:48:03,830
Oh, yeah, Ryan! Oh, my gosh!

828
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:07,043
Oh, yes! Oh, Ryan! Oh, yes!

829
00:48:07,158 --> 00:48:11,334
- Cut it out, please!
- Oh, yeah, Ryan! Oh, my God! Oh, yeah!

830
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:17,505
- Oh, Ryan! Oh, yes!
- Cut it out!

831
00:48:17,627 --> 00:48:19,513
- Stacy, stop!
- Oh, yeah!

832
00:48:19,629 --> 00:48:21,966
- Stacy, stop! Stop!
- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

833
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:24,724
- Stop! Hey!
- Oh, yeah!

834
00:48:24,843 --> 00:48:27,428
Oh, yeah! Oh, Ryan!

835
00:48:27,554 --> 00:48:30,900
Stacy, you're acting insane!

836
00:48:32,892 --> 00:48:37,404
What the... If that cooz
let out my cats, so help me!

837
00:48:57,041 --> 00:48:58,678
Trixie?

838
00:48:58,793 --> 00:49:00,300
Mayberry?

839
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,047
Trixie?

840
00:49:04,851 --> 00:49:07,480
Oh! Chaz!

841
00:49:08,595 --> 00:49:11,228
Ryan! The bastards have surrounded the house.

842
00:49:11,347 --> 00:49:13,068
Time to put on your big-boy pants, son.

843
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:16,779
Dad, you don't have to talk to me
like I'm some kind of kid.

844
00:49:18,688 --> 00:49:21,820
Aim high, and I'm not talking
about life goals.

845
00:49:21,941 --> 00:49:24,029
Shoot 'em in the head. Let's move!

846
00:49:24,152 --> 00:49:27,580
Stacy, how could you do that to me?

847
00:49:29,282 --> 00:49:32,913
- Didn't last night mean anything to you?
- Well, of course it did.

848
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:34,922
I think.

849
00:49:36,831 --> 00:49:40,462
But, you know, Ryan's just so
good-looking, you know? It's...

850
00:49:43,171 --> 00:49:45,935
That one's coming fast, Chaz. Chaz?

851
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:47,970
Chaz, that one's coming pretty fast.

852
00:49:50,595 --> 00:49:53,359
Help! God, help me!

853
00:49:53,473 --> 00:49:55,941
Please, God! Don't let me die!

854
00:49:59,354 --> 00:50:01,544
Commie bastard!

855
00:50:05,318 --> 00:50:07,121
Attaboy! Good job!

856
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:09,957
Chaz! Look out behind...

857
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:15,416
- He's been bit.
- Oh, no, Chaz!

858
00:50:15,537 --> 00:50:19,000
He's been bit. Get him on the couch!
I'll take care of the door.

859
00:50:31,772 --> 00:50:33,492
Chew-a-dent!

860
00:50:34,556 --> 00:50:37,877
Oh! Oh, God! Ruby!

861
00:50:39,686 --> 00:50:42,900
Honey, I am so sorry.

862
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,118
I completely forgot you were in there.
What the...

863
00:50:49,487 --> 00:50:53,165
I must be the most
selfish person in the world.

864
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:59,455
Here I am, acting like I'm doing you
some kind of favour by keeping you alive.

865
00:50:59,581 --> 00:51:03,294
Deluding myself that there might
actually be a cure for this.

866
00:51:03,418 --> 00:51:05,921
But really I just...

867
00:51:07,005 --> 00:51:09,946
I can't bring myself to end it for you.

868
00:51:13,845 --> 00:51:17,024
I never would have talked
to Ryan without you.

869
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:20,402
And though I deeply regret

870
00:51:20,518 --> 00:51:22,819
meeting that...

871
00:51:22,937 --> 00:51:25,357
elitist man-whore,

872
00:51:25,481 --> 00:51:28,162
for one night, damn it,

873
00:51:28,276 --> 00:51:30,032
I lived, Ruby.

874
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:31,743
I lived.

875
00:51:38,244 --> 00:51:40,296
What the ding-dong?

876
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:50,053
Hi! Would you shut it off, please?

877
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:52,807
- Shut it down. Thank you.
- Hi.

878
00:51:52,926 --> 00:51:55,979
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

879
00:51:56,554 --> 00:52:00,777
So I... I guess you guys have heard
about the zombies in town?

880
00:52:00,892 --> 00:52:03,989
Zombies? Zombies!
Guys, she said there's zombies!

881
00:52:04,103 --> 00:52:06,868
Yeah, we heard about the zombies.
That's why we're here.

882
00:52:06,981 --> 00:52:10,825
So if you wouldn't mind taking the keys out
and coming inside that tent,

883
00:52:10,944 --> 00:52:13,708
we've got a little bit of coffee
and a whole lot of questions for you.

884
00:52:13,821 --> 00:52:16,123
If we're going to be honest here,

885
00:52:16,241 --> 00:52:20,855
I was really looking forward to putting
some distance between me and this town.

886
00:52:20,974 --> 00:52:22,589
I get it! I get it!

887
00:52:22,705 --> 00:52:26,466
You're like, "Who's this powerful
muckity-muck trying to cramp my style,

888
00:52:26,584 --> 00:52:29,514
when all I wanna do is try on
some lipstick and chase guys,

889
00:52:29,629 --> 00:52:33,307
and get as far as I can from those
gosh-darn flesh-eaters?" Am I right?

890
00:52:33,424 --> 00:52:35,726
If I say yes, will you let me go?

891
00:52:35,844 --> 00:52:37,896
Let me put it this way...

892
00:52:46,281 --> 00:52:48,582
That's a no.

893
00:52:56,698 --> 00:53:01,503
Hey, I've got some John Cougar Mellencamp.
That always used to cheer you up.

894
00:53:01,619 --> 00:53:06,128
It's just John Mellencamp now, Dad. I haven't
listened to him on purpose in 20 years.

895
00:53:07,375 --> 00:53:09,843
Son, I liked Stacy.

896
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:15,347
Although I'm not sure she was the girl your
mother would have wanted you to marry,

897
00:53:15,466 --> 00:53:17,935
I am sorry that she got her brains eaten.

898
00:53:19,012 --> 00:53:21,017
- Don't do this, Dad.
- Do what?

899
00:53:21,139 --> 00:53:24,104
- I'm just being real here.
- I'm not ready to be cool with you.

900
00:53:24,225 --> 00:53:28,615
Oh, good, good.
What, you think I wanted any of this, huh?

901
00:53:29,689 --> 00:53:32,074
Look at Chaz back there.

902
00:53:32,192 --> 00:53:35,905
When he turns, who do you think's
gonna have to put him down?

903
00:53:37,947 --> 00:53:41,459
For all of his faults, I loved that boy
like he was my own son.

904
00:53:42,785 --> 00:53:44,506
What do you mean?

905
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:47,835
Well, Chaz was adopted. You knew that, right?

906
00:53:47,957 --> 00:53:51,054
- Son-of-a-bitch. He was adopted?
- Bottom line is...

907
00:53:51,169 --> 00:53:52,759
you and I have to stay positive,

908
00:53:52,879 --> 00:53:55,216
remember how fortunate we are to be
in the Governor's good graces.

909
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,893
- Fortunate?
- Yes.

910
00:53:57,008 --> 00:54:00,721
If you weren't so deep in the Governor's
good graces, we wouldn't be in this mess.

911
00:54:00,845 --> 00:54:02,518
Well, we're almost out of it, okay.

912
00:54:05,808 --> 00:54:07,529
Ow! Gaa!

913
00:54:08,811 --> 00:54:13,367
- Buy a girl a drink first, will you?
- I'm sorry about that business there.

914
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:15,570
- Sincerely!
- I'm not infected.

915
00:54:15,693 --> 00:54:18,826
- I wasn't bitten.
- I know, Deb, I know.

916
00:54:18,947 --> 00:54:21,331
We just have protocols we have to follow.

917
00:54:21,449 --> 00:54:23,917
You guys aren't real military, are you?

918
00:54:24,035 --> 00:54:25,708
What is "real"?

919
00:54:25,828 --> 00:54:29,672
Is "real" like a construct
of our own subconscious or...

920
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:31,713
Is this real?

921
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:33,590
Is this real?

922
00:54:33,711 --> 00:54:35,384
- Are any of us real?
- Yeah.

923
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:37,344
The rest of us are real.

924
00:54:37,465 --> 00:54:40,051
All right, we're a private security firm
hired to handle this situation.

925
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:42,810
Whoa! You guys are doing a bang-up job!

926
00:54:42,929 --> 00:54:44,934
- Thank you.
- I'm being sarcastic.

927
00:54:45,056 --> 00:54:47,275
- What are you gonna do now, kill me?
- Kill you? Deb...

928
00:54:47,392 --> 00:54:49,728
That hurts me. Come on!

929
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:53,316
I am a father, all right?
Look, look at these.

930
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:55,491
Look at these little... Two little boys.

931
00:54:55,608 --> 00:54:59,037
- Those are my kids. They are adorable, right?
- Yeah.

932
00:54:59,153 --> 00:55:03,495
Could I go back and look at these little
angels in their eyes with murder on my brain?

933
00:55:03,616 --> 00:55:05,835
I don't think so, Deb.

934
00:55:05,952 --> 00:55:10,045
No, your test was negative.
You are free to go.

935
00:55:10,164 --> 00:55:11,292
Oh!

936
00:55:11,416 --> 00:55:13,421
Awesome sauce!

937
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:15,595
Okay, great! Um...

938
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:20,054
Oh, if you could just, uh, get rid
of that road block, I'll be... on my way.

939
00:55:20,175 --> 00:55:22,144
Uh... sorry.

940
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:25,225
I might have been a little confusing there.
You're free to go back.

941
00:55:25,346 --> 00:55:28,941
- Wait, I'm sorry, back?
- Yeah, back to where you came from.

942
00:55:29,058 --> 00:55:31,776
You can't ever leave that town on,
kind of, a forever-type basis.

943
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,567
Forever?

944
00:55:33,688 --> 00:55:37,235
So you're just gonna... you're gonna
wall us in with those things?

945
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:39,446
That's a fate worse than death.

946
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:41,989
You're gonna tell that to your two lamo kids?

947
00:55:42,113 --> 00:55:44,165
They're four and six, Deb.

948
00:55:44,282 --> 00:55:47,130
They wouldn't understand
the moral complexity of that situation.

949
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:50,837
Portland may be a small town, but people
are going to notice if we disappear.

950
00:55:50,955 --> 00:55:53,174
The official story is radiation leak.

951
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:55,759
I don't think people are going
to be champing at the bit

952
00:55:55,877 --> 00:55:58,214
to go check it out for themselves,
believe you me.

953
00:55:58,338 --> 00:56:01,435
You're not going to get away with this.
They're...

954
00:56:01,549 --> 00:56:05,974
People... people are going to talk.
There's social media, there's like...

955
00:56:06,095 --> 00:56:07,935
Twerking, My Face.

956
00:56:08,056 --> 00:56:12,196
I don't think you've noticed, but
the internet's shut down and cellphones.

957
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:15,822
Deb, you would have had a better chance
of getting out of here if you were infected.

958
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:18,157
They're looking for case studies
out there right now,

959
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:20,659
trying to figure out how to stop this thing.

960
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:21,951
Wait.

961
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:25,498
Wait! I know Frank Waverly.
The Governor is sending him a helicopter.

962
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:28,664
- And I'm supposed to be on it.
- You know Frank Waverly?

963
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:30,338
Yeah.

964
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:32,423
Yeah! I do.

965
00:56:34,666 --> 00:56:37,466
The rendezvous point's right up ahead here.

966
00:56:37,585 --> 00:56:40,433
Throw a blanket over your brother,
we don't want to scare anybody.

967
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:48,101
- Oh, God! He looks terrible.
- Oh, jeez!

968
00:56:48,221 --> 00:56:49,265
God!

969
00:56:54,936 --> 00:56:58,816
Whoa! Deb's car. She's here.
I hope she's okay.

970
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:02,238
Was that girl ever okay?
Now let me do the talking.

971
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:05,457
Some say shooting a gun's like an organism.

972
00:57:05,572 --> 00:57:07,873
That must be why it's harder
for women to shoot g...

973
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:09,912
- What the hell is going on here?
- Oh!

974
00:57:10,034 --> 00:57:13,747
- Well, if it isn't Don Juan Demarco.
- No, no, that wasn't what it sounded like.

975
00:57:13,872 --> 00:57:18,213
- Prop a squat here, One Direction.
- I have very classic masculine features, sir.

976
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:22,385
- Why is she restrained?
- Oh, you must be Frank Waverly.

977
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,593
And you must be fond of digging ditches,

978
00:57:24,716 --> 00:57:27,017
cos that's what you're gonna be doing
if I don't get some goddamn answers!

979
00:57:27,135 --> 00:57:29,769
- You know, the Governor...
- Is sending a helicopter, yeah?

980
00:57:29,888 --> 00:57:32,058
- I know.
- Hello, Frank.

981
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:34,650
I thought I owed it to you
to do this face to face.

982
00:57:34,767 --> 00:57:37,022
- You're not going anywhere.
- Governor.

983
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:40,657
- Why?
- We screwed the pooch, Frank.

984
00:57:40,773 --> 00:57:44,119
Well, you did. At least, that's how
history is going to show it.

985
00:57:44,235 --> 00:57:48,957
I have volumes of documentation.
This whole thing was on your demand.

986
00:57:49,073 --> 00:57:51,375
My people are at your home
and your office right now.

987
00:57:51,492 --> 00:57:54,078
I don't think documentation is going
to be much of a problem.

988
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:56,968
Why, self-serving son-of-a...

989
00:58:03,755 --> 00:58:05,724
Let the young ones go.

990
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,810
They had no part in this.

991
00:58:07,926 --> 00:58:09,895
I wish I could, Frank.

992
00:58:10,011 --> 00:58:13,808
Colonel Newton, I think you saw
these three try to rush the border.

993
00:58:13,932 --> 00:58:17,111
I think you had to use some
extreme measures to stop them.

994
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:19,029
And I think you succeeded.

995
00:58:19,145 --> 00:58:20,948
Sir.

996
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:22,985
Goodbye, Frank.

997
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:24,992
Wait!

998
00:58:25,109 --> 00:58:29,250
My dad has more than enough motivation
to keep quiet and I'm his son.

999
00:58:29,364 --> 00:58:31,001
- So?
- So...

1000
00:58:31,115 --> 00:58:33,701
the only wild card here is her.
She's a reporter.

1001
00:58:33,826 --> 00:58:35,499
What? I'm not a reporter!

1002
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:38,088
I mean, I would like to be a reporter.
I'm trying to be a reporter.

1003
00:58:38,206 --> 00:58:39,677
She films everything.

1004
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:43,753
She's documented this whole disaster
with this tiny little hidden camera.

1005
00:58:43,878 --> 00:58:46,049
Somebody's gonna find that footage one day.

1006
00:58:46,172 --> 00:58:48,260
Wouldn't you like to get
your hands on it right now?

1007
00:58:48,383 --> 00:58:51,064
I patted her down myself.
I did not find a camera.

1008
00:58:51,177 --> 00:58:54,274
Deb, just give it up.
They're going to search Otis eventually.

1009
00:58:54,389 --> 00:58:56,773
Otis? That's her car.

1010
00:58:56,891 --> 00:59:00,024
The footage is in her car.
Let's go! You, with me.

1011
00:59:01,187 --> 00:59:02,575
The car!

1012
00:59:03,898 --> 00:59:06,947
I got the glove box.
Dekker, you pop the hood.

1013
00:59:07,068 --> 00:59:10,532
- Try the trunk.
- What? No! Not the trunk!

1014
00:59:11,906 --> 00:59:13,033
Pop it.

1015
00:59:13,157 --> 00:59:15,922
Governor, sir. Mr Governor...

1016
00:59:16,995 --> 00:59:18,336
What the... Damn thing...

1017
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:25,881
What? Holy... Oh, man!

1018
00:59:26,004 --> 00:59:28,424
Get that... get that... get that...

1019
00:59:30,717 --> 00:59:34,015
Hey, man, that was an accident.

1020
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:36,521
That was a mistake, man.
Don't do it. Put your gun down.

1021
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:39,688
I didn't mean to shoot him.
Come on, we know each other!

1022
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:42,443
That was just a...

1023
00:59:42,562 --> 00:59:45,112
- Oh, this is all my fault.
- Ugh!

1024
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:48,660
It's customary to say something like,
"No, no, no, don't beat yourself up."

1025
00:59:48,776 --> 00:59:50,698
- Words to that effect.
- Don't beat yourself...

1026
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:53,205
Never mind. It really is my fault.

1027
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:55,743
But I'm going to make it right
for the two of you.

1028
00:59:55,867 --> 00:59:58,252
- What are you talking about?
- Frank?

1029
01:00:04,198 --> 01:00:06,037
Come on!

1030
01:00:09,797 --> 01:00:11,553
Ruby, no!

1031
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:12,718
Huh?

1032
01:00:13,801 --> 01:00:15,771
Go, go! Let's go.

1033
01:00:16,721 --> 01:00:17,773
Dad!

1034
01:00:17,889 --> 01:00:22,361
Ryan. Ryan, I should have been there
more for you when you were growing up.

1035
01:00:22,477 --> 01:00:24,316
I could have helped you
be a little more rugged.

1036
01:00:24,437 --> 01:00:26,489
Why are you talking like that?
You're coming with us.

1037
01:00:26,606 --> 01:00:28,576
No! Like this?

1038
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:30,198
I'm gone, son.

1039
01:00:30,318 --> 01:00:33,533
Bit by a zombie in a God-awful sweater.

1040
01:00:33,655 --> 01:00:36,953
Now listen up. You stay
with that girl Deb, all right?

1041
01:00:37,075 --> 01:00:40,005
She's good for you. She's got moxie.

1042
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:42,837
Head back into Portland and
stay alive till this blows over.

1043
01:00:42,956 --> 01:00:45,376
I'm gonna buy you some time.
You go take care of her.

1044
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,470
Go on! Go!

1045
01:00:47,585 --> 01:00:48,759
Go!

1046
01:00:54,801 --> 01:00:58,099
All right, come on!
End it for me, you piss-ants!

1047
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:08,858
My dad...

1048
01:01:08,982 --> 01:01:11,153
Chaz, Stacy.

1049
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:14,705
I can't believe they're all gone.

1050
01:01:15,947 --> 01:01:20,787
Nobody left to tell me
what to think or what to say.

1051
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:24,297
It's kinda scary, actually.

1052
01:01:29,669 --> 01:01:34,390
That time my family was up on the roof,
that Fourth of July, and saw my dad.

1053
01:01:34,507 --> 01:01:35,634
Yeah?

1054
01:01:36,885 --> 01:01:39,602
He wasn't fixing the barbecue.

1055
01:01:39,721 --> 01:01:43,019
He was in my neighbour's backyard...

1056
01:01:44,517 --> 01:01:46,522
with no pants.

1057
01:01:48,021 --> 01:01:51,283
He was exposing himself to their family dog.

1058
01:01:53,401 --> 01:01:54,908
Whoa!

1059
01:01:55,028 --> 01:01:57,364
Apparently, he'd been doing it for months.

1060
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:00,872
Basset hound.

1061
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:05,457
He moved out after that.

1062
01:02:07,874 --> 01:02:10,294
I've never told that story to anyone.

1063
01:02:14,339 --> 01:02:16,925
We've never going to get out of here, are we?

1064
01:02:18,009 --> 01:02:20,144
Does not look like it.

1065
01:02:20,261 --> 01:02:22,349
All the roads will be blocked
just like that one.

1066
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:24,607
- They'll be looking for us especially.
- Hmm.

1067
01:02:24,724 --> 01:02:27,821
On the bright side, no more lines at the DMV.

1068
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:29,987
Yeah.

1069
01:02:30,104 --> 01:02:33,568
I bet some of those workers
will be more lively as zombies.

1070
01:02:33,691 --> 01:02:36,372
Mmmm! Rrrgh!

1071
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:38,823
Organ donor!

1072
01:02:38,947 --> 01:02:40,584
Delicious!

1073
01:02:40,698 --> 01:02:44,162
- What was that? Is that...
- My zombie.

1074
01:02:44,285 --> 01:02:47,085
- I didn't know zombies sounded like that.
- Yeah. You've heard them, right?

1075
01:02:47,205 --> 01:02:49,697
No, I haven't heard them talk.

1076
01:02:51,292 --> 01:02:53,095
Oh, my God!

1077
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:57,800
Only you could make me laugh
at a time like this.

1078
01:02:59,467 --> 01:03:03,264
That's mostly what I remember
about the night that we hung out.

1079
01:03:03,388 --> 01:03:05,559
Was you just cracking me up.

1080
01:03:09,894 --> 01:03:11,484
No one thinks I'm funny.

1081
01:03:11,604 --> 01:03:14,238
They just think I'm strange or...

1082
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:16,991
awkward or...

1083
01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:19,329
I say the wrong thing.

1084
01:03:21,114 --> 01:03:24,495
I'm so dumb to think
that I could be an on-air anchor.

1085
01:03:24,617 --> 01:03:26,753
I think you'd make a great news anchor.

1086
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:31,211
Plus I've always wanted to slap the tan
right off of Brent Masters' face.

1087
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:44,598
Oh, my God, Ryan!

1088
01:03:44,721 --> 01:03:47,734
Ryan, we have to go, now.

1089
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:52,646
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where's the fire?

1090
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:55,072
You mentioning Brent Masters back there.

1091
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:57,111
If the outside world could see
what was actually going on here,

1092
01:03:57,233 --> 01:03:58,906
the government would have to do something.

1093
01:03:59,027 --> 01:04:01,032
The people would demand it.
We'd have a chance.

1094
01:04:01,154 --> 01:04:03,657
Yeah, but how? All communications
have been shut down.

1095
01:04:03,781 --> 01:04:06,118
Phone, cable, internet, cell towers.

1096
01:04:06,242 --> 01:04:07,535
Not satellite.

1097
01:04:17,795 --> 01:04:20,264
Get the lead out.

1098
01:04:20,381 --> 01:04:22,932
Our signal goes out to most
of the outlying counties,

1099
01:04:23,051 --> 01:04:24,937
sometimes as far as Canada.

1100
01:04:25,053 --> 01:04:27,188
- Where is everyone though?
- I don't know.

1101
01:04:27,305 --> 01:04:30,520
It would be a skeleton crew
because of the holiday, but...

1102
01:04:33,311 --> 01:04:36,159
The morning staff briefing.

1103
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:38,194
Livelier than usual.

1104
01:04:38,316 --> 01:04:42,112
Hey, that's Misty Raines.
Ah, they're still smiling.

1105
01:04:42,237 --> 01:04:46,080
She's got so much Botox in her face I don't
know if she's ever going to decompose.

1106
01:04:46,199 --> 01:04:48,334
And that's Jerry Chavez, sports.

1107
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:51,714
Oh, and he brought his wife's
famous cupcakes.

1108
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:54,836
Oh! Brent Masters.

1109
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:57,805
Even as a zombie, his hair is camera perfect!

1110
01:04:57,919 --> 01:05:00,339
- Oh, is he coming?
- Uh-huh.

1111
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:03,927
He was always mean to me,
but I'm going to do him proud.

1112
01:05:06,459 --> 01:05:08,759
Okay, let's... let's go.

1113
01:05:11,808 --> 01:05:15,025
Control room's in here. Oh?

1114
01:05:22,735 --> 01:05:25,583
We have to turn the signal back on.

1115
01:05:25,697 --> 01:05:29,707
- Wow, you really know what you're doing.
- Yeah, I have my moments.

1116
01:05:29,826 --> 01:05:32,839
- Despite my track record.
- Yeah, what does this do?

1117
01:05:32,954 --> 01:05:35,252
Okay, don't touch that.

1118
01:05:47,093 --> 01:05:51,565
And that's it! You just lock the camera off
on the anchor desk.

1119
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,484
On you, right?

1120
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,320
Ah, yeah.

1121
01:05:55,435 --> 01:05:57,107
Yeah, I guess.

1122
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:01,114
- What's wrong?
- Uh...

1123
01:06:01,232 --> 01:06:02,620
I'm just, uh...

1124
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:06,363
so used to working the camera.

1125
01:06:06,487 --> 01:06:09,371
Maybe I should do that and
you can do the announcement.

1126
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:10,701
- Deb.
- What?

1127
01:06:10,825 --> 01:06:15,963
Listen to me. Not only is this an insanely
perfect opportunity for you to live your dream,

1128
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:19,343
but people need to know
what's happening here.

1129
01:06:19,459 --> 01:06:23,136
What about you, Ryan Waverly?
Are you living your dream?

1130
01:06:23,254 --> 01:06:26,967
I want to be a personal life coach. So, yes.

1131
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:30,431
Well played, sir.

1132
01:06:33,014 --> 01:06:34,225
Okay!

1133
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:38,195
You know, I'm going to clean up.

1134
01:06:38,311 --> 01:06:41,111
I can't make my broadcast debut
with a scrunchie in my hair.

1135
01:06:41,231 --> 01:06:43,864
- Okay. I'll be here. Hurry.
- Okay.

1136
01:06:58,414 --> 01:07:00,217
Deb, are you all...

1137
01:07:01,584 --> 01:07:02,795
right?

1138
01:07:06,005 --> 01:07:08,888
What do you think? Is this okay for camera?

1139
01:07:10,051 --> 01:07:12,270
It's... uh...

1140
01:07:12,387 --> 01:07:14,273
You're perfect.

1141
01:07:15,932 --> 01:07:18,400
I raided the weather girl's locker.

1142
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:25,529
Are you ready?

1143
01:07:29,237 --> 01:07:30,957
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1144
01:07:31,072 --> 01:07:34,915
This is how I always see them do it.
In five, four...

1145
01:07:35,034 --> 01:07:36,588
Three...

1146
01:07:38,913 --> 01:07:41,796
Good afternoon. I'm Deb Clarington.

1147
01:07:41,916 --> 01:07:44,420
It was an Independence Day for the ages,

1148
01:07:44,544 --> 01:07:47,427
as a bizarre disease ran rampant
through this normally peaceful

1149
01:07:47,547 --> 01:07:49,634
seaside community yesterday.

1150
01:07:49,757 --> 01:07:53,435
Homes were destroyed,
countless family members lost

1151
01:07:53,553 --> 01:07:55,973
and thousands left to wander,

1152
01:07:56,097 --> 01:08:00,059
in search of the only thing that would
quench their now insatiable appetites...

1153
01:08:00,185 --> 01:08:03,091
live human flesh.

1154
01:08:05,899 --> 01:08:08,663
Unbelievable? Maybe.

1155
01:08:08,776 --> 01:08:12,869
It certainly would be easier to swallow
the cover-up story about a radiation leak.

1156
01:08:12,989 --> 01:08:18,588
Indeed, for all we know, there are only two
souls left uninfected in this once-happy hamlet.

1157
01:08:18,703 --> 01:08:24,302
Is it worth sending people in to save a fledgling
newscaster and her cameraman life coach?

1158
01:08:24,417 --> 01:08:27,632
Two days ago, I might have said no.

1159
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,300
But then another story broke.

1160
01:08:31,424 --> 01:08:33,844
This one easier to believe for most,

1161
01:08:33,968 --> 01:08:37,848
but for this reporter,
it's the headline of the decade...

1162
01:08:37,972 --> 01:08:40,523
woman falls in love.

1163
01:08:42,018 --> 01:08:46,775
Sure it happens every day,
all over the world, but not to me.

1164
01:08:46,898 --> 01:08:50,196
Maybe a crisis like we have here
speeds things up a bit, but...

1165
01:08:50,318 --> 01:08:53,746
I don't think it can create
something from nothing.

1166
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:59,036
And even though this person
may not return my affections...

1167
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:02,174
and... I am really not fishing here...

1168
01:09:02,288 --> 01:09:04,543
it's okay.

1169
01:09:04,666 --> 01:09:09,672
I'll always know, deep down,
that he felt something too.

1170
01:09:09,796 --> 01:09:13,308
So I'm Deb Clarington, saying yes,

1171
01:09:13,424 --> 01:09:15,595
I think these two are worth saving.

1172
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:20,108
So if you're watching out there, please tell the
authorities to send help to Portland, Maine...

1173
01:09:22,110 --> 01:09:25,295
No! No!

1174
01:09:27,146 --> 01:09:30,574
Deb. Deb, I'm here. Hey!

1175
01:09:30,692 --> 01:09:34,535
Listen to me, that's the greatest newscast
anyone's ever seen.

1176
01:09:34,654 --> 01:09:37,833
Seriously, you'll probably win
a Peabody or something.

1177
01:09:37,949 --> 01:09:39,669
Am I...

1178
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:42,546
better than Brent Masters?

1179
01:09:42,662 --> 01:09:44,501
Crazy better.

1180
01:09:45,874 --> 01:09:48,633
Wait, crazy, like I was,
like, a crazy person?

1181
01:09:51,838 --> 01:09:54,175
Can we get, like, two seconds!

1182
01:10:00,847 --> 01:10:03,184
I don't know how long I have left.

1183
01:10:03,308 --> 01:10:06,249
Yeah, I guess we've never seen
anyone turn before.

1184
01:10:12,734 --> 01:10:14,703
- Listen, Deb.
- Yes.

1185
01:10:14,819 --> 01:10:17,453
If you want me to, I could, um...

1186
01:10:18,698 --> 01:10:20,834
I mean, if you want.

1187
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:23,252
You would shoot me in the head?

1188
01:10:24,329 --> 01:10:27,093
Well, I... What? I thought...

1189
01:10:27,207 --> 01:10:29,508
I guess it would be one tap now?

1190
01:10:29,626 --> 01:10:31,382
It was your idea first!

1191
01:10:31,503 --> 01:10:36,216
Tonight's top story, a bizarre twist regarding
a reported radiation leak in Portland, Maine.

1192
01:10:36,341 --> 01:10:40,137
A broadcast, apparently originating
from within the quarantine zone,

1193
01:10:40,261 --> 01:10:42,765
went viral on the internet just hours ago,

1194
01:10:42,889 --> 01:10:46,401
promoting a lot of people to wonder
what exactly is going on there?

1195
01:10:46,518 --> 01:10:51,737
I'm Deb Clarington saying yes,
I think these two are worth saving.

1196
01:10:51,856 --> 01:10:56,049
So if you're watching out there, please tell the
authorities to send help to Portland, Maine...

1197
01:10:57,695 --> 01:10:59,451
No! No!

1198
01:10:59,572 --> 01:11:03,997
911 emergency centres in several
states report being flooded with calls

1199
01:11:04,118 --> 01:11:06,206
in response to the alleged zombie attack,

1200
01:11:06,329 --> 01:11:08,630
with some calling to ask if the video's real,

1201
01:11:08,748 --> 01:11:12,177
while many others are concerned
for the safety of these two people.

1202
01:11:12,293 --> 01:11:16,635
A background check on Deb Clarington
revealed that she is employed at the station

1203
01:11:16,756 --> 01:11:20,813
from which she's broadcasting,
but as a camera-person, not an anchor.

1204
01:11:20,927 --> 01:11:23,940
Prior to that, she was employed
at a Lady Footlocker,

1205
01:11:24,055 --> 01:11:26,226
until she was let go for staging

1206
01:11:26,349 --> 01:11:29,980
an unauthorised sock-puppet production
of Jesus Christ Superstar.

1207
01:11:30,103 --> 01:11:34,742
A lot has been said about videos going viral
but, for Deb Clarington, it's like an outbreak.

1208
01:11:34,858 --> 01:11:38,072
The hits on her zombie-attack clip
is impressive enough,

1209
01:11:38,194 --> 01:11:42,454
but it's the number of her viewers weighing
in and creating their own online videos

1210
01:11:42,574 --> 01:11:43,867
that's truly staggering.

1211
01:11:43,992 --> 01:11:46,672
As the chairman of the Zombie
Outbreak Authentication Society

1212
01:11:46,786 --> 01:11:51,792
I happen to know zombies
and that is not real. It's too tan.

1213
01:11:51,916 --> 01:11:54,171
I can tell bad effects work from a mile away.

1214
01:11:54,294 --> 01:11:56,180
This is the real deal, man. It's not bogus.

1215
01:11:56,296 --> 01:12:00,472
Oh, that girl is my new hero.
What is going on right now?

1216
01:12:00,592 --> 01:12:04,554
Deb, if you're still alive out there,
I want you to know, you are so hot!

1217
01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:08,061
They say they're in Maine?
That's not even a real state.

1218
01:12:08,183 --> 01:12:13,486
Deb, encouraged by your example, I told
a co-worker that he is the love of my life.

1219
01:12:13,605 --> 01:12:15,657
He's my boss, he's happily married.

1220
01:12:15,773 --> 01:12:18,822
So we both agreed it best
that I look for another job.

1221
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:22,158
Originally, I planned to debunk this vid
using basic physics.

1222
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,997
Then I thought about recreating
part of it with some friends.

1223
01:12:25,116 --> 01:12:27,501
Those idiots actually think
this thing is real.

1224
01:12:27,619 --> 01:12:30,668
Is the video real in your own opinion?

1225
01:12:30,788 --> 01:12:33,374
I believe that the woman in the video
believes it's real.

1226
01:12:33,499 --> 01:12:35,552
Now, how sure are you?

1227
01:12:35,668 --> 01:12:38,172
She exhibits all five signs of a person
who's speaking the truth.

1228
01:12:38,296 --> 01:12:42,970
I expound more on this, of course, in my book
The Five Signs Of Truth, which is available...

1229
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:45,263
What the fudge?

1230
01:12:45,386 --> 01:12:49,479
As night falls on Portland, Maine,
more questions than answers.

1231
01:12:49,599 --> 01:12:53,941
Repeated calls to the Governor's office from
this station and many others around the country

1232
01:12:54,062 --> 01:12:59,412
have gone unanswered, but we will not rest
until we get to the bottom of this situation.

1233
01:13:00,485 --> 01:13:03,119
Now how about this hilarious cat video?

1234
01:13:04,531 --> 01:13:06,203
Yes, Deb!

1235
01:13:06,324 --> 01:13:09,836
You did it! They'll have to investigate now,
they'll just have to.

1236
01:13:09,953 --> 01:13:12,717
Well, I'm really happy for you, Ryan.

1237
01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:17,671
Let's get real here. We both know in a few
minutes I'll be trying to eat your brains.

1238
01:13:17,794 --> 01:13:20,593
Well, the joke's on you then,
cos it will be a small meal.

1239
01:13:20,713 --> 01:13:24,936
Really? You are starting to look
so delicious right now.

1240
01:13:25,051 --> 01:13:27,732
And you're starting to look like
you've lost a lot of blood.

1241
01:13:27,846 --> 01:13:32,235
- Does it matter at this point?
- It matters to me. Where's the first-aid kit?

1242
01:13:33,434 --> 01:13:37,694
I think it's in the break room, but it's
too far unless we go through the studio.

1243
01:13:37,814 --> 01:13:40,033
- Then let's go.
- Okay.

1244
01:13:45,947 --> 01:13:48,166
No! No, no, no, no.

1245
01:13:48,283 --> 01:13:50,085
I have an idea.

1246
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:55,301
Hear me, undead!

1247
01:13:55,415 --> 01:13:58,879
This man is a friend to us. He means us no...

1248
01:13:59,002 --> 01:14:01,007
Oh, God! Oh, I regret that.

1249
01:14:05,175 --> 01:14:06,515
Ooh!

1250
01:14:11,556 --> 01:14:13,691
Oh, that was awesome!

1251
01:14:17,437 --> 01:14:19,572
Ladies first.

1252
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,156
Oh, wrong way!

1253
01:14:24,277 --> 01:14:25,997
Come on!

1254
01:14:30,095 --> 01:14:31,835
Stairs!

1255
01:14:58,478 --> 01:15:01,277
Deb, Deb! Come on, come on,
we've gotta get going.

1256
01:15:01,397 --> 01:15:05,241
No! Ryan, it's the end of the line for me.

1257
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:08,574
- Okay, I... I... I'll carry you. Come on.
- Where?

1258
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:13,203
Listen. We've had a good run.

1259
01:15:13,326 --> 01:15:16,672
But I'm starting to get hungry.

1260
01:15:16,788 --> 01:15:19,837
I can really see myself
going to town on your liver.

1261
01:15:19,958 --> 01:15:23,090
Your spleen, maybe a couple of pancreas.

1262
01:15:23,211 --> 01:15:25,892
Your pancreas is actually singular.

1263
01:15:26,005 --> 01:15:27,678
Oh, thank you, Bill Nye.

1264
01:15:27,799 --> 01:15:30,480
Ooh! Hey, hey! Stay with me, stay with me!

1265
01:15:31,636 --> 01:15:34,271
Ryan, what are you still doing here?

1266
01:15:34,389 --> 01:15:36,857
You could outrun Misty Raines easily.

1267
01:15:36,975 --> 01:15:40,937
And now you're bound to end up
like one of us or die a horrible death.

1268
01:15:41,062 --> 01:15:44,693
I'd rather take that risk than be
without the people I care about.

1269
01:15:44,816 --> 01:15:46,619
The people you...

1270
01:15:48,111 --> 01:15:52,334
Oh, you mean me? Duh!
I'm the people you care about?

1271
01:15:54,576 --> 01:15:58,110
I really wish we'd gotten to watch
the fireworks together on your roof.

1272
01:15:59,163 --> 01:16:01,442
That would have been awesome.

1273
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:04,379
But now I'm starving.

1274
01:16:04,502 --> 01:16:05,713
Okay, hey.

1275
01:16:05,837 --> 01:16:07,225
Here.

1276
01:16:07,338 --> 01:16:09,260
Do what you gotta do.

1277
01:16:11,134 --> 01:16:13,103
Thank you.

1278
01:16:19,934 --> 01:16:21,322
Got him!

1279
01:16:23,521 --> 01:16:25,111
- Hey.
- What's up?

1280
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:29,580
Deb, right? We are huge fans.

1281
01:16:31,863 --> 01:16:34,544
- Are you good to go?
- Oh! Wait. What?

1282
01:16:34,657 --> 01:16:38,370
You have a bite wound there. Just keep
it clean and change that bandage daily.

1283
01:16:38,494 --> 01:16:41,175
No, she was bitten by a zombie.

1284
01:16:43,791 --> 01:16:45,844
Are you talking about what
those people back there have?

1285
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:48,131
- Yeah!
- You can't get that from biting.

1286
01:16:48,254 --> 01:16:51,718
Yeah, that is really
an archaic way of thinking.

1287
01:16:51,841 --> 01:16:55,982
I mean, a biter would have to have an open
wound in his mouth literally gushing blood.

1288
01:16:56,095 --> 01:17:00,651
Even then, it's like a thousand to one.
What are you, some kind of zombie-phobe?

1289
01:17:00,767 --> 01:17:04,361
No, no. A lot of my best friends are zombies.

1290
01:17:04,479 --> 01:17:05,736
Probably.

1291
01:17:07,065 --> 01:17:09,615
We're just messing with you.
These things are hideous.

1292
01:17:09,734 --> 01:17:12,664
- Yeah, filthy!
- But you can't get it from a bite, so...

1293
01:17:12,779 --> 01:17:15,247
Turns out it was in the water or something.

1294
01:17:15,365 --> 01:17:16,753
Who knew?

1295
01:17:22,247 --> 01:17:26,304
- You said you wanted to eat me.
- Yeah, that's embarrassing.

1296
01:17:26,417 --> 01:17:29,265
You talked about internal organs.
I mean, it got really specific.

1297
01:17:29,379 --> 01:17:32,309
- Well, I was delirious, okay.
- You sure you don't want to now?

1298
01:17:33,925 --> 01:17:37,935
- Mm, you said some things, too.
- I know I did.

1299
01:17:38,054 --> 01:17:39,525
So...

1300
01:17:39,639 --> 01:17:42,818
It's safe to assume that you like me.

1301
01:17:45,645 --> 01:17:46,689
Hey!

1302
01:17:46,813 --> 01:17:49,862
How did you guys figure out
this virus so fast?

1303
01:17:49,983 --> 01:17:53,744
- Oh, we had a little help.
- Dad!

1304
01:17:53,862 --> 01:17:54,905
Ryan!

1305
01:17:55,029 --> 01:17:58,078
Hey, Deb. What a night, huh?

1306
01:17:58,199 --> 01:18:02,161
- Turns out biting doesn't turn you.
- Yeah, we heard!

1307
01:18:02,287 --> 01:18:07,341
- But how did you escape the troops?
- Well, like I said, biting doesn't turn you.

1308
01:18:07,458 --> 01:18:12,471
Come on! What are you waiting for?
I'm already bit, you dumb pansies!

1309
01:18:12,589 --> 01:18:14,973
- Drop the weapon!
- Come on, finish me!

1310
01:18:15,091 --> 01:18:17,595
- My head is killing me.
- We are approaching.

1311
01:18:17,719 --> 01:18:21,358
- Put it down!
- Make me, you dumb-ass!

1312
01:18:22,599 --> 01:18:25,446
Dale! Chowder! Mad Dog!

1313
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,114
Chaz.

1314
01:18:27,228 --> 01:18:30,076
Jazzy Chazzy. That's my Pop.
Be careful with him, okay?

1315
01:18:30,190 --> 01:18:31,945
- Oh?
- Son!

1316
01:18:32,066 --> 01:18:34,237
Pops, we play billiards.
Be cool! That's my Pops!

1317
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:36,116
- That's my boy!
- Yep.

1318
01:18:36,237 --> 01:18:39,619
Came to save you. I wonder where Ryan is?

1319
01:18:39,741 --> 01:18:42,244
Off with his new girlfriend probably.
I don't see him.

1320
01:18:45,622 --> 01:18:48,172
What's up, douche?

1321
01:18:48,291 --> 01:18:51,672
- We're alive and we're under arrest.
- That's my boy!

1322
01:18:51,794 --> 01:18:53,135
Yeah!

1323
01:18:53,254 --> 01:18:55,141
Now, come on.

1324
01:18:55,256 --> 01:18:57,511
Hurry up and kiss the girl.

1325
01:18:57,634 --> 01:18:59,805
- Oh...
- I've got a date with the Feds.

1326
01:18:59,928 --> 01:19:03,795
The towns overrun with zombies so they'll
be bombing the hell out of Portland soon.

1327
01:19:05,934 --> 01:19:07,939
Come on!

1328
01:19:09,979 --> 01:19:12,067
I'm sorry I tried to eat you.

1329
01:19:12,190 --> 01:19:14,527
You don't have to kiss me.

1330
01:19:14,651 --> 01:19:16,620
No, I was going to anyway.
