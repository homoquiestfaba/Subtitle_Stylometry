The first time we've ever
tried anything like this.

175
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,880
As juveniles.

176
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,240
It's our first offense,
you'll be fine.

177
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,400
Don't wimp out.

178
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,160
- Let's go.

179
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,680
What're you lookin' at them
for? They got you into this.

180
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,240
- Get up.

181
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,520
Now, come on!

182
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,920
- Your son is more serious.

183
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,600
He was in possession of a
loaded weapon.

184
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,720
- Officer, that's not
possession, the boy found

185
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,800
the weapon in the car, picked
it up and was arrested.

186
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,480
Transitory control
isn't possession.

187
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,240
You've got possible attempt,
possible mischief, okay?

188
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,120
- And you've got a problem,
lady, I wouldn't be so cool,

189
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,120
if my kid were arrested
for stealing a car radio.

190
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,400
- Stealing?

191
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,440
There's no evidence of
anything having been taken

192
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,600
from that vehicle.
- [chuckles] Alright.

193
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,040
It's not my problem, you
deal with family court.

194
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,080
- Thank you, officer.

195
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,120
I may not look it, it's
not my style...

196
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,800
I'm about as upset as
I've ever been.

197
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,400
I don't believe it.

198
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,400
Why?
- I don't know.

199
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,920
- That won't fly, Jeffrey.

200
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,640
- I mean it, I don't know
why I did it, I just did.

201
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,400
I thought it would be a kick.

202
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,600
- Was it?

203
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,880
[clock buzzes]

204
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,200
- Where you going?

205
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,520
- [sighs] They're cleanin'
the street.

206
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,040
I've gotta move the car.
- Mm, give me a kiss.

207
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,680
- Go back to sleep.

208
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,840
- Hurry back.

209
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,520
Okay?

210
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,840
[ominous music]

211
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,880
- God!

212
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,720
God!

213
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,920
- Did you find a spot?

214
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,440
What?

215
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,360
- They hit us again.

216
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,240
They ripped up the whole car
and they stole the cassette.

217
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,720
- Alright, don't get nuts,
did you call the police?

218
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,720
- [chuckles] They
left me a note,

219
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,840
telling me what I already know.

220
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,360
- Why don't we just put the
car in a garage already?

221
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,840
- [chuckles] A garage.

222
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,320
You know, why didn't I
think of that?

223
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,680
In a garage, which one?

224
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,040
The one up the street where
they want $385 a month,

225
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,440
while I'm bustin' my chops
to pay the rent here?

226
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,920
- The car runs, doesn't it?
- Yeah, it runs.

227
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,160
- So, just don't replace
the cassette player.

228
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,240
- I have to replace it, the
car is trashed, alright?

229
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,320
I can't drive a client
around like that.

230
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,720
I'm sorry.

231
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,160
- So, what are you gonna do?

232
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,280
- I'll take it to Mac.

233
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,400
And see what it'll cost
to repair it.

234
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,120
[knocks]

235
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,000
Yeah, hi, this is 237, do
you have anything for me?

236
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,680
Yeah.

237
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,440
Well, no, it's the first
time hearing about it.

238
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,560
I drove all the way out
here for nothin'.

239
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,240
I know.

240
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,120
Okay.

241
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,440
Alright, thanks.

242
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,000
[phone keypad bleeps]

243
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,880
[phone rings]

244
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,680
- Hi.
- Hey, you called?

245
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,800
- What's up with you?
[Tom chuckles]

246
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,280
- [Tom] My car got hit again.

247
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,720
- Get out.

248
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,360
- You should see the
number they did on it.

249
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,360
- Are you insured?
- Not for that.

250
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,600
They canceled me
after last time.

251
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,840
I've got collision,
it's all I could afford.

252
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,720
So, then I drive 40
miles to sell an annuity.

253
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,040
Turns out they're on
vacation, nobody told me.

254
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,280
- I'm tellin' ya.

255
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
It's time for you stop
knockin' your brains out.

256
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,400
I set up an appointment for you

257
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,480
to take the company
exam next week.

258
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,800
I knew you wouldn't do it.

259
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,080
You dead or what?

260
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,320
- No, no, I'm here.

261
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,400
- Look, you take the test,

262
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,720
and when they offer you
the job, you decide.

263
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,360
- Had another day like
today, it'd look pretty good.

264
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,760
- It is good, I've got a couple
openings in my department

265
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,840
in a month or so, I can
get you in there.

266
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,320
- Alright, alright, Jesus,
you nag like my mother.

267
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Honey?
[suspenseful music]

268
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,960
- Tom.

269
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,440
These officers are
here to see you.

270
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,120
- Mr. Casey, your car was
broken into last night?

271
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,520
- Yeah, you're tellin' me.

272
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,200
- Well, we caught the
kids that did it.

273
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,920
- You're kiddin'? [chuckles]

274
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
That's a first.

275
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,720
Yeah, 'cause you know,
I made a call.

276
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,920
There was just like a gang of
kids hangin' around the car.

277
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,560
- Mr. Casey, we've got a
problem, one of the kids

278
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,560
was arrested with a loaded
.38 caliber Smith & Wesson.

279
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,240
Said he found it under the
front seat of your car.

280
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,320
When we ran it, it was
registered to you.

281
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,120
- Geez, I forgot all
about that thing.

282
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,800
- I thought you got rid of it?
- I did.

283
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,440
Sort of.

284
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,840
You see, we were held up
about a block from here,

285
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,560
and the guy had a gun,
so I got a little crazed,

286
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,160
and I went upstate and I
bought that .38 and I brought

287
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,880
it home and, well, she got
a little bit upset with me.

288
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,840
- I hate guns.

289
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,520
- What was it doing in the car?

290
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,360
- She wouldn't let me
keep it in the house,

291
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,120
[chuckles] so I put
it in the car.

292
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,520
To tell you truth, I had
completely forgotten about it,

293
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,120
until just now.

294
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,440
- I'm sure that's true,
Mr. Casey, but having

295
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,080
a concealed loaded weapon
in your car is a felony.

296
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,320
- [chuckles] Come on.

297
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,520
- Mr. Casey, we need you to
come down to the station.

298
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,600
- Wait a minute, I'm
not under arrest, am I?

299
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,680
- That's about it.

300
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,880
- These little punks
break into my car,

301
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,920
tear it up, and I get arrested?

302
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,560
They get a slap on the wrist,
I've gotta get a lawyer?

303
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,160
- [Friend] Little bastards,
I'd like to break their faces.

304
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,480
- And then some, and
the lawyer I go to see,

305
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,600
wants five grand just to
say "not guilty."

306
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,480
2,500 a word, you
work your way up.

307
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,120
- Lawyers are scum.

308
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,560
Look, what about your
brother-in-law, Manny?

309
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,600
He would do it, wouldn't he?

310
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,280
- Oh, yeah, everybody
would love that.

311
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,240
The bum that Sally
married gets arrested

312
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,680
and the good son-in-law
has to bail him out.

313
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,960
- If the price is right.

314
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,440
- You know what kind of
a mouth her sister's got.

315
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,600
- You need representation.
- Not from them.

316
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,840
I don't want their nose
into my business.

317
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,400
Can you believe that all
of this has come down

318
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,360
because of those little...

319
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,160
So, is your brother gonna
get me their names or what?

320
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,360
- Let me give him a call.

321
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,200
[dark atmospheric music]

322
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,120
- [Jeffrey] That bastard
called the cops.

323
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,520
That's how we were nailed.
- Who cares how?

324
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,840
We were!

325
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,200
- [Jeffrey] You two are
making me sick.

326
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,480
So you were arrested, big
deal, those are the breaks.

327
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,320
If you can't take the heat,
don't hang with the man.

328
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,480
- Well, we've both
got records now.

329
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,680
- What records, Fats, you wuss?

330
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,760
You been listenin' to
your father?

331
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,280
He's a CPA, for cryin' out loud.

332
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,280
Do you trust me?

333
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,520
Have I ever conned you?

334
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,320
Have I?

335
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,560
I have researched this,
here's what'll happen.

336
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,480
The only charge that'll
stick is attempt.

337
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,560
We are underage, so the
family court,

338
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,120
not the criminal court,
has jurisdiction.

339
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,440
- So, what?

340
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,680
- So, the family court
guys are weenies.

341
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,560
You look scared, guilty,
remorseful, you may have to cry.

342
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,080
After that, they pass sentence.

343
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,720
Which, even if you're

345
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,480
we'll be suspended, or
probation, that is it.

346
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,720
But here's the good part.

347
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,840
This is the state penal code.

348
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,120
We get off, but the guy who
left a loaded gun in the car,

349
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,040
Mr. Concerned Citizen who
called the police on us?

350
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,080
He is guilty of a felony.

Hm?

352
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,160
- So, the hearing's in two
weeks, and Tom is crazed.

353
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,680
- You wanna tell me what's
wrong with your husband?

354
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,960
He buys a gun and keeps
it loaded in his car?

355
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,840
- Manny, stop it, she
feels lousy enough.

You keep coloring, big ears.

357
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,720
- I wouldn't let him keep
the gun in the house.

358
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,160
- Alright, maybe we
can get the whole thing

359
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,920
knocked down to a misdemeanor.

360
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,160
Take the position that his
car is his place of business.

361
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,960
Let me talk to him.

362
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,600
- He's not home, he's
visiting with a friend of his.

363
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,080
- Alright, have him call
me when he gets in, huh?

364
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,280
He doesn't know you're
calling, does he, Sally?

365
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,560
- Um, Manny, I just--
- Look.

366
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,480
I'm not gonna handle this
if Tom doesn't want me.

367
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,880
- No, no, no, it's not that,
it's just,

368
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,480
you know Tom, he's
embarrassed in front of family

369
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,960
that he got in trouble and...

370
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,120
Look, I'll call you back, Manny,
okay?

371
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,360
I really appreciate it,
so does Tom.

372
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,440
- Okay, don't get aggravated.

373
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,800
It'll work out.

The juveniles, they protect
them like the queen's jewels.

I don't know how Jim's
brother's got the stuff.

377
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,320
- What did you want their
names and addresses for?

378
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,760
- I wanted to know where
they were from.

379
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,880
What kind of families.

00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,360

You and your friends
like breakin' into cars.

- I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

386
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,480
- I think we should
talk about this.

- Don't even know who you are.

I'm the guy whose car
you tore up.

which one of your
friends took my gun.

Was it you?

394
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,760
Was it that tall, skinny one,
the one that they call Fats?

395

Or was it Jeffrey?

That's what I wanted,

I've got a message for

he lives, so don't let me

have to rerun it or something.

it's been reported stolen.

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,560
- Change my locks,
another 50 bucks.

516
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,440
Great.

517
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,680
- Thank you, officer.

518
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,080
- "Thank you, officer,"
for what?

519
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,520
What did she do?

520
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,520
- Look, there's a murder every
three minutes in the city.

521
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,720
I guess crank calls
aren't a priority.

522
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,960
- You know, it makes me sick.

523
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,480
You run a red light and
they're all over you.

524
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,800
- Listen, I'm gonna walk and
get some stuff at the cleaners.

525
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,600
We have to be at Angie's
by three, so why don't you

526
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,840
pick me up at 2:15, just honk
and I'll come down, okay?

527
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,840
- Come on, I'll give you a
lift, I don't want you walkin'.

528
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,560
- No, Tom, it's three blocks,
I'm supposed to walk anyway.

529
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,880
2:15, honk, okay?

530
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,080
[knocks]

531
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,360
- Yeah?

532
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,200
- [Man] CAE Locks?

533
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,080
Mr. Casey ordered your
locks changed?

534
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,760
- He didn't say anything
about it to me.

535
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,480
- [Man] I don't know,
I have the order here.

536
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,440
Your husband called my dad,

537
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,120
and my dad sent me over
to do the job right away.

538
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,400
Hi, um...

539
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,960
If you rather I came
back another time, I can.

540
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,840
- Well, my husband
didn't mention it.

541
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,600
He's on the road today, I
don't think I can reach him.

542
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,160
- Oh, that's okay, I can
come back another time,

543
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,400
after you've checked
with your husband.

544
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,520
- You're here, you
might as well.

545
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,320
- I don't need to come in,
I can do it all from here.

546
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,200
- Okay.

547
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,360
- When he called,
your husband said

548
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,160
you'd been having some problems.

549
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,360
It's probably a good
idea for you to do it.

550
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,360
This will only take a
few minutes.

551
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,520
Don't let me keep you
from what you were doing.

552
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,400
- No, I was just
cleaning the closet.

553
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,080
[suspenseful music]

554
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,400
- Got any power around?
- Oh, uh, over there.

555
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,120
- It's a good thing you
and your husband

556
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,840
decided to get rid of this lock.

557
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,640
- Why? It's no good?

558
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,680
- It's okay, but the one
I got's better.

559
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,240
My dad says, "if a pro
wants in, he's gonna get in,

560
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,560
"no matter what you have."

561
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,920
- That's comforting.

562
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,360
- Well, the one I got's
gonna slow him up a bit.

563
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,920
Noise drivin' you crazy?

564
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,920
- Nope!

565
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,920
Yes, but what can you do?

566
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,840
- Almost finished with
the drilling.

567
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,480
[drill whines]

568
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,040
You, uh...

569
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,880
You say your husband's on
the road, he a salesman?

570
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,960
I'm sorry.

571
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,640
My dad says I talk too much.

572
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,600
- No, it's okay.

573
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,760
No, he's in insurance.

574
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,680
But he's always home at night.

575
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,960
- He keep a car in town?

576
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,520
- Yeah.

577
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,000
- That must be a pain.
[Sally chuckles]

578
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,200
- It is, yeah.

579
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,800
[ominous tones]

580
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,680
- Done.

581
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,360
You wanna try these?

582
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,040
- [Sally] Oh, uh, they're fine.

583
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,000
[horn honks]

584
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,440
- Oh, uh, oh, it's my husband.

585
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,040
How much do I owe you?

586
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,480
- The call's 58, lock 29,
keys 2.50.

587
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,280
It's 89.50 plus tax is 97.10.

588
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,640
- Okay, I'll be right back.

589
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,440
- Oh, and ma'am, you were
right to be so cautious.

590
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,360
You have any trouble, you
give us a call.

591
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,760
The number's on the receipt.

592
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,120
[ominous tones]

593
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,320
- [Angie] Once the baby comes,

594
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,480
you're not gonna wanna
live in the city.

595
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,120
- But I love the city.

596
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,240
- You drag a carriage up and
down those curbs for a week,

597
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,960
and then you call me.

598
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,480
- It's awfully quiet in there.
- That's a good sign.

599
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,120
Relax, at least they're
not killing each other.

600
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,840
- Well, I think we're
gonna be fine.

601
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,200
- You do?
- Yeah.

602
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,840
They're not lookin' for
guys like him.

603
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,200
- Oh, god, I'm so relieved.

604
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,560
Are you sure we're
gonna be okay?

605
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,680
- Yeah, go home, relax,
it's old news.

606
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,680
- Thank you, Manny.

607
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,440
- Hey, sweetie, take care,
honey.

608
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,080
- Thank you.

609
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,960
[dark electronic music]

610
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,920
Hey, what happened?

611
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,360
- I can't get in, it's the
new lock, the keys don't work.

612
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,720
- What new lock?

613
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,160
- [Sally] Oh, the lock
people you called came today.

614
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,840
- I didn't call any lock people.

615
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,560
- No, this guy came
with an order from you.

616
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,160
He said you ordered the
locks changed.

617
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,920
- Some guy came here, who?
- I don't know, some kid.

618
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,240
- Kid?

619
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,480
What did he look like?
- I don't remember.

620
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,720
He was tall, he was dark,
he was the owner's son.

621
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,440
He knew what he was doing, Tom.

622
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,200
- Any idiot can put in a lock.

623
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,360
- Well, he said if we had any
problem, we should call him.

624
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,440
I've got the number
on the receipt.

625
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,360
- What was the name of
this company?

626
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,120
- I don't remember, just
some initials.

627
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,080
CB or BB Locksmith.

628
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,560
Where are you going?
- To call a locksmith.

629
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,720
- [Jeffrey] Of course he's
going to change his locks.

630
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,360
- [Fats] So, what was the point?

631
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,400
- Fats, I really
worry about you.

632
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,560
I was this close, this
close to the porker's wife.

633
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,040
I want him to know it
was us, that's the fun.

634
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,720
He knows it's us and he
can't do a thing about it.

635
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,080
- 185 bucks for a lock
I didn't need changed.

636
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,400
- The keys worked when I left.

637
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,880
- Well, he rekeyed it,
[chuckles]

638
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,160
this kid's got some nerve.

639
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,200
- Well, how would he do it?
- He's needling me!

640
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,800
He's gettin' in any way he can.

641
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,840
- I let him in.

642
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,600
He had an order from
you, he used your name.

643
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,840
He was in our house.

644
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,600
Oh, god.

645
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,360
Tom.

646
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,840
God.

[classical piano music]

648
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,440
- How's the trial going?
- The usual.

649
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,240
He did, he didn't, they're
both lying. [chuckles]

650
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,680
Jeffrey, did you cut study
hall this week?

651
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,200
I got a call from the school.
- Yeah.

652
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,200
It's just so boring
sitting there like a geek.

653
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,720
I study at night, I
know the stuff.

654
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,080
- Well, that's not the point,
is it?

655
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,960
You're supposed to be in study
hall, that's where you are.

656
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,840
- Yeah.

657
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,120
You're right.

658
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,960
[mother chuckles]

659
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,400
- Mr. Casey.

660
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,760
- [Tom] Mrs. Bateman, thank
you for seeing me so quickly.

661
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,800
- You sounded so upset
on the phone.

662
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,680
- [Tom] I am.

663
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,040
- Do you wanna tell me about it?

664
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,920
- Yeah.

665
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,720
About 10 days ago, I
was arrested for

666
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,320
criminal possession
of a firearm.

667
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,200
I go to court at the
end of the week.

668
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,440
The gun was under the
front seat of my car,

669
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,200
when some kids broke into it.

670
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,320
Now, the kids that did it have
gotten my telephone number,

671
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,200
my credit card number,
and my address.

672
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,480
They are making threatening
calls, they have canceled my

673
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,360
credit card, they have even
changed the locks on my door.

674
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,240
- How do you know it
was those kids?

675
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,120
- I know.

676
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,040
- Why did you come to see me,
Mr. Casey?

677
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,800
- I thought you could do
something about it, you see,

678
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,560
my privacy is being invaded
and I want it stopped.

679
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,240
And if it isn't stopped one
way, I will stop it another.

680
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,200
- I detect a threat.
- I'm just giving information.

681
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,640
Now, maybe you could do
something about this,

682
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,080
before I have to?

683
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,240
That is what lawyers

through this, by your reasoning,

to work in his own car,

in a bad neighborhood,
can arm his vehicle,

713
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,120
and if he's caught, hope
it's only a misdemeanor.

714

to keep firearms

He yells at every little thing.

going through.

You know, you just have
to know how to handle him.

because everything with you is

take my advice.

paid enough for that?

where he lives!

threatened the boys and me.

We can understand his
anger and we're prepared

00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,200
to make reparations for any
damages to his car, but,

937
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:48,800
I won't allow him to make
these kinds of accusations.

Mark on the street.

He dragged Mark into an
alley and he threatened him,

942

against a brick wall.

the incident?

happened to anybody,

away from it.

We had some kicks.

1029
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,080
- Okay.
[suspenseful music]

1030
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,480
- What're you doin'?
- I'm callin' old Tom.

1031
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:35,800
Tell him the whole thing's off.

1032
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,240
- What are you, crazy?
- No, I think you're right.

1033
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,560
I think we've gotta come
clean to clear our conscience,

1034
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,240
and tell him all the things
we've been doing, you know,

1035
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,080
the phone calls, credit
cards, changing the locks.

1036
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:47,000
- Quit it.
- He's not gonna do anything.

1037
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,640
- I really think I have to.

1038
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:50,800
I've been thinking about
all those stereos, too.

1039
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,280
Those ones that are
stowed at your house?

1040
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,360
And then I have to admit that
I didn't see him do anything

1041
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,920
to you in the alley, I was
lying the way you told me to.

1042
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,560
But the toughest part is
going to be telling him about

1043
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:02,320
the cradle, the way you two
left it in his bathroom,

1044
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,880
after you trashed his place.

1045
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,000
- He's not gonna believe that
crap, he knows it was you.

1046
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,680
- I don't think so.

1047
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,080
What if the police check the
fingerprints on the cradle?

1048
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:13,560
They're yours, both of
you touched them,

1049
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,600
after I wiped it clean.

1050
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,320
- Uh-uh, no, we didn't.

1051
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,200
- Are you sure?

1052
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:20,560
Are you sure?

1053
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,320
Are you sure?

1054
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,000
You're not?

1055
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:28,240
You were holding it and he
put the pig in.

1056
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:31,160
I mean, you better be real
sure before you want out.

1057
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:33,920
So?

1058
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,520
What do ya say?

1059
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,120
What?

1060
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,640
- I'm in.

1061
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:47,360
- Yeah.

1062
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,040
- Perfect.

1063
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,880
Hey, oink oink.

1064
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,200
[suspenseful music]

1065
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,040
- [Tom] I don't know
what's happenin' to me.

1066
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,960
I don't know what I'm doing.
- That's the problem.

1067
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,880
Don't do anything, back off.

1068
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:57,160
Look I don't blame you, this
whole thing's been a nightmare.

1069
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,360
But it's not about right and
wrong anymore, it's survival.

1070
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,960
And you've gotta focus
on what's right.

1071
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,240
Sally, you and the baby,
that's where it is.

1072
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:08,800
- I bought a gun.

1073
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,800
- Geez, Tom.
- I know.

1074
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,760
I don't know what else to do.

1075
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,640
- What you do is you
get rid of it now, man.

1076
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,240
Then you go home, you get Sally,

1077
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,680
and you go look for a
new apartment.

1078
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,720
Get away from this mess
and start clean.

1079
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:28,520
- Yeah.

1080
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,280
Yeah.

1084
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,080
Come on, come on!

[suspenseful music]

1086
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:20,560
- Honey?

1087
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:26,760
Honey?

1088
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,480
[phone rings]

1089
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,760
Hello.

want to find the treasure,

1091

follow the clues.

1092
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,160
- If you touch her,
I'll kill you.

1093
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,120
- [Robotic Voice] You'll
get the first clue

1094
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:51,600
from the phone booth at
the corner of 20th street

1095
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:55,080
and 10th avenue at exactly 5PM.

1098
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,360
- You makin' a call or what?
- I'm waiting for one.

1099
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:14,000
[man speaks foreign language]

[phone rings]

1101
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,200
- [Robotic Voice] The men's
room at the Penthouse Bar.

1102
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:21,360
Be there at six sharp or
the clue will be gone.

1103
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:31,760

[moody electronic music]

1105
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:54,960
- Give him 20 minutes.

[suspenseful music]
[knocks]

1107
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,520
- Alright, just leave it
outside the door.

1108
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,880
- [Man] No, I need a signature.

1109
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,360
- I don't understand why they
didn't sign for it downstairs.

1110
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,000
- Where's Jeffrey?
- I want you out of here.

1111
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:09,680
- Where is he?
- What do you want from us?

1112
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:10,680
- I want my wife!

1113
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,120
He's got my wife!
- Mr. Casey, that's not true.

1114
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,520
- Shut up!

1115
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:18,800
You have no idea what is going
on here, who your son is.

1116
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,600
- Mr. Casey--
- I know it's him!

1117
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:23,000
He uses a computer voice,
but I know who it is.

1118
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,000
[ominous tones]

1119
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:29,720
She's pregnant.

1120
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,560
- [Detective] Mr. Casey,
your wife's only been gone

1121
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:33,960
a few hours.
- Oh, please.

1122
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,480
She didn't leave her
underwear on the bed

1123
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,960
with a knife sticking in it!

1124
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,480
- Dan will check on that
when I take you downtown.

1125
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:41,560
- He knows where she is.

1126
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,120
- I don't!

1127
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,160
I wish I could help you.

1128
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,200
Look, maybe she just
went shopping.

1129
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:59,600
There's sales all over town.

1130
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:02,160
She'll probably just come
home loaded with packages.

1131
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:05,760
- You shut your mouth!
- He's crazy, he's crazy!

1132
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,200
Your wife probably never
even left the building.

1133
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:11,480
- [Detective] Let's go.

1134
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:34,800
[horn honks]
[dramatic music]

1135
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:38,000
Suspect's on the ground,
heading east!

1136
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,800
- We should have cuffed
him, okay, stay on him.

1137
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:43,000
He bolted, you stay put!
- Where are you going?

1138
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:43,960
- Maybe I can help.

1139
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,400
- You're not going
near that man.

1140
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,000
- He's heading to his house,
it's just through the alley.

1141
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,760
- What do you mean?
- I've gotta see this.

1142
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,400
- Jeffrey, what's going on?

1143
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,560

1144
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:12,440

- Secure the building, now!

1154
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,160
- We've got an incident here.

1155
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,640
Perp's somewhere in
the building.

1156
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:58,640
I want everybody cleared out
of the first and second floor.

1157
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:01,480
- [Officer] Clear
across the street.

1158
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:02,600
Make sure those
people stay back.

1159
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:06,040
- I want everybody out of
this area, now!

1160
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,280
- Who do we have?
- Male Caucasian, thirties.

1161
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,280
Got a record for firearm
possession, he's unbalanced,

1162
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,760
and may have weapons in the
building we don't know of.

1163
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:31,360
I'm gonna try and talk him out.

1164
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:40,560
Mr. Casey, Tom, this
is Lieutenant McKnight.

1165
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:43,280

[sirens wail]
[helicopter blades whir]

1169
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,160
- Anything you can tell
us about the building?

1170
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,240
- There's a hallway
that goes straight

1171
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,680
through to the back door.

1172
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,720
All the buildings that
were built at that time

1173
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,040
had the same floor plan.

1175
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:35,880

- Help her.

1177
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,400
Is she gonna be okay?
- She's in shock.

1178
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:57,440
She'll be alright.

1179
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,120
- She was in a closet
in the basement!

1180
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,640
- Gee, Mr. Casey.

1181
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:03,880
I am sorry I didn't believe
you about your wife.

I know what you did!
- No!

- Hey, Tom.

1191
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,920
Are you gonna shoot me in
front of all these cops?

1192
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:39,800

Jeffrey, get over here!

Oh, my god.

1197
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,280
- [SWAT] Alright, team
number one to the left.

1198
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,920
Team number two to the right.

1199
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:03,360
Move, move, move!

1200
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:13,640
Holding their position.

1201
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,280
- Hey.

1202
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:21,280
- Alright, we can see him,
has he got anyone else?

1203
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,880
- No, just the kid.

1204
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:26,040
There's a rear entrance,
but this guy could go.

1205
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,520
I wouldn't surprise him.

1206
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:55,720
Tom?

1207
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:57,800
Tom, the ambulance is here.

1208
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,360
So, your wife's
gonna be alright.

1209
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:01,960
Now, I know you'd like
to go with her.

1210
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:06,360
So, why don't you just put the
gun down and let the kid go?

1211
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,440
Okay?

1212
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:09,800
- Hey, Tom, you wanna be
with your wife.

1213
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:12,160
Look what she's been through.

1214
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:26,680
- Let the ambulance go, get
her to the hospital, now!

1215
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:37,440
- [Officer] Come on,
clear the way, let's go.

1216
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,800
- Alright.
[suspenseful music]

1217
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:43,760
Me and you.

1218
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,280
You looked me right in
the eye and you told me

1219
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:50,240
she probably never even
left the building.

1220
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:52,880
You knew she was here.

1221
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,560
I wanna hear you say it was you.

1222
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,440
- [Detective] This was
in Sally's hand.

1223
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:30,720
- Is this Jeffrey's jacket?

1224
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:33,360
- Yes.

1225
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:37,760
[suspenseful music]

1226
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:47,520
- Tom, I think you're
an obsessive-compulsive.

1227
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:52,040
You keep insisting that
I've done all these things.

1228
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,280
But you don't have any proof.

1229
01:18:55,320 --> 01:19:00,200
- That's the thing about a
gun, you don't need any proof!

1230
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,800
- Tom?

1231
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:02,880
Tom, you see what I have here?

1232
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:04,480
This is Jeffrey's jacket.

1233
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:08,080
A torn piece of it was
in your wife's hand.

1234
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,240
We got him, Tom.

1235
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,480
- That's not mine!

1236
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:17,520
- I saw you take it off.

1237
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:20,240
- I was wearing it, but
it's not mine.

1238
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:23,320
You see, Tom, here's
how it works.

1239
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,440
I could say to you right now,
I did it.

1240
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:29,760
How are you going to prove it?

1241
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:30,640
- Jeffrey!

1242
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:33,640
Tell him the truth.

1243
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:36,240
- See, they can't even talk
to me without my lawyer.

1244
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:46,080
- Then I don't know how
else to stop you.

1245
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:48,560
- Oh, god.

1246
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:53,640
Please!

1247
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,040
Mr. Casey.

1248
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:56,960
I believe you.

1249
01:19:59,000 --> 01:19:59,840
But, please.

1250
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,400
He's only a child.

1251
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:05,480
- Tom!

1252
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,000
Don't.

1253
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,520
It's for nothing!

1254
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,600
You're gonna ruin your
life for nothin'.

1255
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:11,480
- Please!

1256
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:14,920
- Tom, we got him, I
swear to you!

1257
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,960
- No, he'll get off!

1258
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,880
- No, he won't!

1259
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:22,720
He won't.

1260
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:31,880
I hope you never have to
say this about your child,

1261
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:35,080
but he won't get off.

1262
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:37,240
- [Robotic Voice] From the
phone booth at the corner

1263
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:41,560
of 20th street and 10th
avenue at exactly 5PM.

1264
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:47,360
The men's room at the
Penthouse Bar.

1265
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:50,520
Be there at six sharp or
the clue will be gone.

[suspenseful music]

1267
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,440
- Come on, come on, come on.

1268
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,040
- Tom!
[ominous tones]

1269
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,200
One last round.

[glass smashes]

1271
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:22,240
- Jeffrey!

1272
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,120
Jeffrey!

1273
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:26,280
Jeffrey!

1274
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:33,520
Jeffrey?

1275
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,680
Somebody, he needs help!

1276
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:42,600
It's alright, I'm here.

1277
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:43,480
Hey.

1278
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:45,600
Jeffrey.

1279
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:50,080
I'm sorry.

1280
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:55,640
I'm sorry.

1281
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:00,000
- Give me the gun, Tom.

1282
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,440
Give it to me.

1283
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:10,160
Your wife and baby are
fine, she's at Mercy.

1284
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,440
We'll drive you.

1285
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:16,720
- I'll walk.
