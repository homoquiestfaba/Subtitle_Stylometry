That's ridiculous.

184
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:44,624
Up you go. Up, up.
Good girl!

185
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,826
Anything useful?

186
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:48,661
Oh, not so far.

187
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,163
There's almost
no information.

188
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,700
But at least
this Professor Spatz
has been to the Congo.

189
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:57,737
Finally something by someone
who's actually seen gorillas
with his own eyes.

190
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:59,772
(SIGHS)
No, no,
stay here awhile.

191
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,710
There's no change.

192
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,079
We've done everything
humanly possible.

193
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:08,115
Except pull him
out of it.

194
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:12,085
As long as he's
still breathing,
we've got to keep trying.

195
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:14,754
Do you know I've figured out
what it is, Trudy?

196
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:16,689
You have to save
this gorilla

197
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:20,193
so we finally have someone
in the house who can wear
my hand-me-downs.

198
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,661
(LAUGHING)

199
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:23,997
Bill!

200
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:25,899
Oh, good. I can still
make you laugh.

201
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,269
Oh!

202
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,340
Yeah, that's it.
You hold on tight.

203
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,412
(LABORED BREATHING)

204
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,354
(BREATHING STOPS)

205
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,371
TRUDY: Buddy looked up at me
with such trust,

206
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,273
but I didn't know anything.

207
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,943
I didn't know how to raise
a baby gorilla.

208
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,680
So, I went for advice
to that most dangerous
of species,

209
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,083
the expert.

210
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:28,555
Every detail is perfect.

211
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:30,357
Look at the teeth.

212
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,330
TRUDY: Where
did you get these?

213
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:39,699
They're specimens
I collected myself.

214
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:41,468
They're from all over
the world.

215
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:52,145
Mrs. Lintz, my dear,
certainly you have
questions for me.

216
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:53,646
I need information,
Professor.

217
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,948
I have a gorilla
living in my house.

218
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,051
What do they eat?
How do they
groom themselves?

219
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:00,187
When do the mothers
wean their young?

220
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:02,655
What are their daily habits?
But most of all,
what is their play like?

221
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,157
(SMUG CHUCKLE)

222
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:07,394
My dear woman,
the gorilla is an
unfathomable mystery.

223
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,362
He's completely
taciturn.

224
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:12,099
He's humorless,
introverted,
unresponsive.

225
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:14,401
He utterly lacks
what we would call

226
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:16,203
"imaginative invention."

227
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:22,442
May I ask how long you
actually spent with them
in the jungle?

228
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:24,744
Ten astonishing days.

229
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:26,446
You're kidding.

230
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:29,482
I would never jest about
something like that.

231
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:33,120
Survival in the Congo
is not to be taken lightly,
Mrs. Lintz.

232
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,954
No, I'm sure.

233
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:38,125
Well, thank you
for your time,
Professor Spatz.

234
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,727
But Mrs. Lintz,
what do you intend on doing
with your gorilla?

235
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,895
I'll raise him
the same way
I raised my chimps.

236
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,264
Which is?

237
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:45,798
As far as possible
like human children.

238
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:48,235
Oh! That's
preposterous!

239
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:50,303
Revolutionary as it
might seem to you,

240
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,573
I have encountered
no limits or
even real difficulties.

241
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,576
When they catch cold,
do you have any idea
what they need?

242
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,212
Chicken soup.

243
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:02,215
Hmm.

244
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:10,257
Buddy, Buddy, Buddy,
Buddy, Buddy! Whoo!

245
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:15,528
(GRUNTING)
Take a little bite.
Come on, just a little bite.

246
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:17,764
Open your mouth.

247
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,332
Come on.

248
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,234
Oh, Mrs. Lintz,
thank heaven you're back.

249
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:22,435
What is it?

250
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:24,637
He won't eat,
not for anything.

251
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:27,607
Oh, what do you mean?
Of course he will.
Here, here, here.

252
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,110
Hmm.

253
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,381
EMMA: I got to
chew it for him?

254
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,816
Well, it's the only way
he eats. You know that.

255
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,722
I got enough to do
without chewing up food
for monkeys.

256
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,225
Come here, Buddy.

257
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:50,397

take off my coat.

keep yourself calm.

to say. Mmm-hmm.

hand now, exactly?

276
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:33,105

No, not for him.

and a gentle pull
should fix that.

his fingers, Emma.

that he'll bite.
