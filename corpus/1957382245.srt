[turn signal clicking]

360
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,750
- [Lilly] Oh.
- [woman] Hi. Thank you.

361
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:40,041
[woman] Goldfish. Oh gosh.

362
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:43,958
No, I... I think once they're done,
they're, you know...

363
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,666
Sorry for your loss.

364
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,000
- Okay. Bye.
- [muzak playing]

365
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,083
- [phone clatters]
- [receptionist] Can I help you?

366
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:51,916
Uh, no. I just think I've made a mistake.

367
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,291
Are you here to see Dr. Larry?

368
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:58,000
- Uh, well, is it... is it Larry Fine?
- We just go by Dr. Larry.

369
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:58,958
Oh.

370
00:22:59,041 --> 00:22:59,916
Lilly Maynard?

371
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,791
- Uh, yes. That's, uh...
- [dog barks]

372
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:04,916
- Oh! Okay. Wow! Oh!
- [receptionist] Helen.

373
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,541
Helen, please.

374
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:09,500
[Helen] All right. I can't help it.
What do you think I'm here for?

375
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:10,833
[receptionist] Sorry.

376
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:12,500
Uh, what's your pet's name?

377
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:15,875
Well, uh, that's just it.
I... I don't have a pet.

378
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:18,208
- No pet?
- No.

379
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:20,166
[receptionist] Uh, Dr. Larry,

380
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,750
uh, Lilly has an appointment but no pet.

381
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,583
That's a first.

382
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:25,500
- [dog barks]
- Oh.

383
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:28,083
Oh my. Hey! [laughs] Buddy, I'm married.

384
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:29,541
[woofs]

385
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,666
I get this 24 hours a day.

386
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:34,726
- I want his marbles knocked off.
- Helen, it's called neutering.

387
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:38,208
Nobody's here to get
their marbles knocked off, I presume.

388
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,083
Uh, I'm as advertised.

389
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,708
Did you have a question
about an animal or what?

390
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:45,791
Well, uh, no, I don't.

391
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:49,541
I... I had gotten a referral for you
from a gal.

392
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:50,625
A gal?

393
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:52,916
Regina Miller?

394
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,458
Is she still with the state?

395
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,541
Uh, she's at New Horizons.

396
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,791
Oh.

397
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:03,708
Oh.

398
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:07,375
Well, I have taken up enough of your time,
so thank you.

399
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:09,500
No, no, no. Why don't you come on back?

400
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:10,916
Come on back. Him too.

401
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,875
- [dog barks]
- [woman] Oh, that's how it is.

402
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:15,416
Not you.

403
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,916
Sit. Sit.

404
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:18,458
Down.

405
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,583
Stay.

406
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,750
- Come.
- Yep.

407
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:21,833
[dog growls]

408
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,541
[Lilly] Am I supposed to be in here?

409
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:29,666
He doesn't mind.
Don't understand why Regina did that.

410
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:34,041
I've been out of the mental health field.
I left it ten years ago.

411
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,166
To become a vet?

412
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,291
- [Dr. Larry] Mm-hmm.
- Isn't that kind of weird?

413
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:41,500
It's an easy explanation really,
but, uh, let's leave it at weird.

414
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:44,791
What were you doing at, uh, New Horizons?

415
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:48,333
Well, I wasn't. I mean, I was,

416
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:50,625
but my husband is, you know, there.

417
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,601
- Is he getting better?
- [Lilly] I guess.

418
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,500
- He says he's fine.
- Well, that's good.

419
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:59,291
- What about you?
- Me? Oh, I'm fine too.

420
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,208
Regina sent you to see me
because you're fine.

421
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:04,541
Well, it wasn't my idea. [chuckles]

422
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:06,208
- But you're here.
- [Lilly] Yeah.

423
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:07,291
I, uh...

424
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:11,375
You know,
she said it might help him a little

425
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:14,375
if I did some work, so...

426
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:18,708
I also... I also kind of traded in
some of my furniture,

427
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:23,416
most of my furniture,
for a pleather La-Z-Boy.

428
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:26,166
Um,

429
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,125
I mean, not all of it, but...

430
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,083
My daughter, our baby, died.

431
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:35,375
Just over a year ago now, so...

432
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:38,875
SIDS, that's what they told us.

433
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:40,458
[Dr. Larry] Oh. [sighs]

434
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,750
That's awful.

435
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,083
My husband Jack didn't handle it so good.

436
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:49,666
[Dr. Larry] And you did?

437
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:52,750
No. No, I...

438
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:54,833
No, I'm...

439
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:00,208
It's a good question.

440
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:04,166
[Dr. Larry] Okay, well...

441
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,333
[sighs]

442
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:09,166
I just don't do
this sort of thing anymore.

443
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,208
Well, no offense,
but you can kind of tell.

444
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:13,458
[monitor beeping]

445
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:18,333
[Dr. Larry] Maybe Regina can set you up
with someone else.

446
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:20,666
Yeah. Yeah.

447
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:22,208
Okay.

448
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:24,976
[Dr. Larry] If you have an animal problem,
you know where to find me.

449
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,041
Thank you.

450
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:29,541
Trigger, hang in there, pal.
It doesn't get better.

451
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:31,208
[door closing]

452
00:26:32,916 --> 00:26:34,625
[classical music playing]

453
00:26:35,666 --> 00:26:38,541
Sarah, that's very good, but<i>...</i>
Okay, okay, don't, um...

454
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:41,958
Relax. Treat it gently. You don't have to
beat it to death, darling.

455
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,958
Oh, Velma, that's... What is that?

456
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:47,166
- It's an emoji.
- [art therapist] Ah-ha.

457
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,601
- [Velma] The poop one.
- [art therapist] Looks very accurate.

458
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:53,250
- When do I get to put it in the oven?
- [art therapist] Soon, dear. Very soon.

459
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:54,708
Jack.

460
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:56,541
[chuckles] That's beautiful.

461
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:02,125
[whispering] I have some finer utensils
back behind the shelf over there.

462
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:07,125
Good work. It's more even this time.

463
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,375
Keep going. Keep going.

464
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:10,458
[classical music playing]

465
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:14,833
[utensils clattering loudly]

466
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:24,500
You found the utensils.

467
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:26,125
Yeah.

468
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:28,416
Um, what's that from?

469
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,416
It's just some old junk
from back when this was a school.

470
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:35,000
- What happened to it?
- The school?

471
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:37,416
Not enough kids.

472
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,333
Come on, let's go finish your vase.

473
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:42,708
It's done.

474
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:44,333
[utensils clattering]

475
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,625

- Go on! Get the hell out of here!
- [chirps]

483
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:29,375
- Go! This is my garden!
- [chirping]

[squawks, flutters]

485
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:32,458
And don't come back!

486
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:35,916
Hi, Lilly.

487
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:38,583
- Who are you talking to?
- You, Chuck.

488
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:39,666
Oh.

489
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:42,833
No. I'm sorry. Chuck, I was just mess...

490
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,458
- [bird trilling]
- Ow! [groans]

491
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:52,833
- [chirps]
- Oh.

492
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:55,000
[Dr. Larry] <i>Well,
it doesn't need stitches.</i>

493
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:57,750
- You got a tetanus shot recently?
- [Lilly] Do I need one?

494
00:28:57,833 --> 00:28:59,208
Just to be safe.

495
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:02,291
The bird obviously thought
you were a threat.

496
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:04,125
Well, I am now.

497
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:08,125
It's, uh, breeding season, you know?

498
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:11,958
Eggs, hatchlings, that sort of thing.

499
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:15,333
- You might wanna stay out of your yard.
- It's my fucking yard.

500
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:19,166
You always this angry?

501
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:22,083
[sighs] What am I supposed to do,
call the cops?

502
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:25,750
I mean, you said call
if I had an animal problem.

503
00:29:26,666 --> 00:29:29,708
Are you familiar with stage three
of the grieving process?

504
00:29:29,791 --> 00:29:33,291
I'm assuming that follows stage two?

505
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:34,625
Not, uh, necessarily.

506
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:36,000
But generally.

507
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:38,166
Uh, it's "bargaining and anger."

508
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,958
Nobody ever talked to you about this?

509
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:45,750
Nope. What comes after that?

510
00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:47,750
Depression.

511
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:49,791
Great. I can't wait.

512
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:53,041
- Mmm, you might not have to wait too long.
- [chuckles]

513
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,208
Jeez.

514
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:56,375
So you're done.

515
00:29:58,083 --> 00:29:59,083
Thanks.

516
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:02,416
- Look, um, sorry about the hassle.
- No hassle.

517
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:06,833
I guess I'm gonna try to find
one of those people doctors.

518
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:08,583
Okay.

519
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:11,625
[door opening]

520
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:16,083
[Dr. Larry] Um... Uh, excuse me.

521
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:18,083
What... What did the bird look like?

522
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:22,250
Um, I don't know. Dark, wings.

523
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:23,833
That... that narrows it down.

524
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:25,250
Why?

525
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:26,625
Um...

526
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:31,083
You know, if... if you...
if you would like to, you know,

527
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:32,833
talk about it.

528
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:34,625
Maybe talk<i>...</i> talk about the bird?

529
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,500
Yeah, the bird.

530
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:39,833
All right.

531
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:41,875
Yeah.

532
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:42,958
Okay, well...

533
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,916
see you later.

534
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,875
[Dr. Larry] Yeah.

535
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:49,541
In... In the meantime, stay away
from that new neighbor of yours.

536
00:30:50,041 --> 00:30:52,375
Yeah, new neighbor.
That... That's a good one.

Oh.

542
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:15,500
No, I don't... I don't want fungus peppers.

- Who does?
- [Lilly chuckles]

544
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:21,166
Do you have anything
that might, um, scare birds away?

545
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:23,291
- Bird deterrent?
- Yeah.

546
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:25,375
- Bird-go-away-ent.
- [woman] That's funny.

547
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:26,916
I like a good joke.

548
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,458
How do you feel about spikes?

549
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:33,333
No, I don't, kinda, need to kebab 'em.

550
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:35,208
Um,

551
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:36,875

554
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:45,041
Yeah. I got one by my pool. No birds come.

00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:46,791
No people either.

with your patients that often.

Oh, you mean 'cause they're animals?
Oh no, we talk all the time.

Tends to be a one-sided conversation

How's Jack doing?

616
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:37,916
Good. I guess.
Well, I have to see him tomorrow.

617
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,083
You have to?

618
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:42,625
Well, it's Tuesday.
Tuesday nights are, uh, family night.

619
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:45,500
So that's what I mean.
I have to go see him 'cause family night.

- Don't you want to?
- Well, yeah. He's my husband.

- [Dr. Larry] Mmm.
- I leave work every week early

622

just so I can be there on time.

623
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,541
But I think I'd go nuts

00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:58,041
if I was shut up in that place 24/7, but,

625
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:00,500
he doesn't seem to mind.

[chuckles]

627
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,875
So was it Jack's idea
to be admitted to the hospital?

628
00:36:04,958 --> 00:36:05,958
[Lilly] Sort of.

629
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,500
Sort of?

630
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:13,500
- Is this how it works?
- How what works?

631
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:16,416
- This.
- [Dr. Larry] Oh, you think...

632
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,500
No, no, no. If we were doing that,
I'd just say,

633
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:20,750
"Sorry our time is up. Take this pill."

634
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,625
Anyway, we're just talking.

635
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:31,291
You know, sometimes we push people away
just to see if they'll come back.

636
00:36:34,416 --> 00:36:35,500
Yeah?

637
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:38,458
Maybe it'll be better this time.

638
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:40,875
You think?

639
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:42,958
Maybe.

640
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:47,666
You sure it wasn't a blue jay?

641
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:51,083
I... I stitched up a cat once
who'd gone a few rounds with a blue jay.

642
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:53,666
Very aggressive avian, that.

643
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:56,750
Don't think it was a blue jay.
Oh. What's that?

644
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:59,125
- That's a hawk.
- No. It wasn't a hawk.

645
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:00,583
I know what a hawk is.

646
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:03,708
- You know, they used to be dinosaurs.
- Mmm.

647
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:05,083
- Birds did.
- Yeah.

648
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:07,000
You probably knew that
because you're a vet.

649
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:09,208
I knew that even before I was a vet.

[lighthearted music playing]

651
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:15,916
[Jack] What happened to your head?

652
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
[Lilly] Oh. Just...
There's a bird that thinks I'm a threat.

653
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:20,958
[Jack] Are you threatening it?

654
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:22,041
[Lilly] No.

655
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:25,583
No, I'm just minding my own business
in the garden.

656
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,500
[Velma] I don't care what she is.

657
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:31,875
You can tell she don't cook.
She's so skinny.

658
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,750
- We got a new recliner.
- [emotive music playing]

659
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:36,416
What was wrong with the old one?

660
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:40,708
Nothing. Just thought we needed a change.

[Dr. Larry] That is a starling.

674
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:33,666
You see the little white flecks
that look like stars?

675
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,750
Very territorial.

676
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:38,833
You won't be able to scare him
away easily. He's too smart for that.

677
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,875
- Smart?
- Oh, they're brilliant.

678
00:38:41,416 --> 00:38:43,875
They're, uh... [chuckles]
extraordinary mimics.

679
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:46,500
Mozart had one as a pet.

680
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:49,083
And, uh, they found in his notebooks

681
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:52,291
a melody from one of his concertos
that he wrote out, and next to it,

682
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:54,666
the melody as the bird sang it,

683
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:58,416
identical,
except for one or two sharps or flats.

684
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,375
Yeah. He was, uh, inconsolable
when the bird died.

685
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:03,833
Even gave it a funeral.

686
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:06,250
There's an idea.

687
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:08,333
[Dr. Larry] Two weeks prior to that,

688
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:11,416
Mozart did not attend
his own father's funeral.

689
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,750
Apparently, his father was an asshole.

00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:28,291
[sighs] Yeah, that's me.

694
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:30,416
Yeah, well, here are the traps.

695
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,708
This is really more for a coyote.

696
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:35,231
I can't sell you this one.
It's illegal... You have a license?

697
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:36,791
No.

698
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,625
I could rent it to you

699
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:40,750
if you got it back to me first thing.

700
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:47,083
- Oh, no. This is just for a little bird.
- Oh. Well, you could trap it with this.

701
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:50,875
But you better release it in Mexico,
or it's just gonna find its way back.

702
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:53,833
I do not want it to come back.

703
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:56,625
There's only one way to do that.

704
00:39:57,708 --> 00:39:58,708
Remediate.

705
00:40:00,166 --> 00:40:01,708
- You mean...
- Exterminate.

706
00:40:01,791 --> 00:40:02,791
Like...

707
00:40:03,666 --> 00:40:04,666
Like, kill it?

708
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,916
We don't like to use that word.
It's inhumane.

709
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,666
Yeah. Okay, that's...

710
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:13,625
I get... I get that. I mean,
it is what you mean though, right?

711
00:40:13,708 --> 00:40:17,125
There are 400 billion birds
on this planet, lady.

712
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,916
- That seems awfully high.
- It's not.

713
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:24,083
- It seems very high.
- It's not.

714
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:26,333
It's my business.

715
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:28,333
I will tell you this.

716
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:30,500
Lady came in last month.

717
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,000
Glass eye. Bird attacked her.

718
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:36,750
- Oh my God.
- I think it was a sparrow.

719
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:39,500
- [whispering] You serious?
- Extremely aggressive.

720
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:43,833
Never feel a thing.

721
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:50,041
[grunts] It's really 400 billion?

722
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:52,333
It's a plague.

723
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:56,625
[whimsical music playing]

724
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,000
[chirping]

725
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,791
[man] What if a raccoon gets at it?

726
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:30,708
Or a cute little bear cub.

727
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,500
Or, like, a baby koala.

728
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:37,625
It's a bird feeder. It's tiny.
Nothing's going to get inside of it.

729
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:40,916
And you know there's no koalas
in North America, right?

730
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,916
Oh yeah. That's true.

731
00:41:44,375 --> 00:41:47,250
I saw a possum shimmy up
a hummingbird water feeder thing one time,

732
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:48,458
a super skinny one.

733
00:41:49,416 --> 00:41:52,166
I mean, it was bent like a palm tree
in a tropical storm.

734
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:55,000
Okay. Well, that's not gonna happen here.

735
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:56,750
Probably not, yeah.

736
00:41:56,833 --> 00:41:58,416
It could, though. You know?

737
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,958
Animals will do anything for a snack.
And sugar water...

738
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:03,250
- Have you tried sugar water?
- No, Dickey.

739
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:06,083
I have not tried hummingbird sugar water.

740
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:07,875
It's really sweet.

741
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:11,333
Any animal would go
to great lengths to taste it.

742
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:13,833
Yeah, it's not sugar water. It's seed.

743
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:15,666
[Dickey] Right. Just seed.

744
00:42:16,916 --> 00:42:18,291
Mixed with poison seed.

745
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:23,458
[sighs] Crap. Now I've gotta go home
and take it down.

746
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,208
I'll clock you out at 5:00.

I'm sorry.

754
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,208
You didn't deserve this.

- [psychiatrist] <i>How are you sleeping?</i>
- [Jack]<i> Fine.</i>

756
00:43:32,666 --> 00:43:34,666
- Are you eating okay?
- Fine. Yeah.

757
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:40,000
- Are you feeling depressed?
- Okay. We don't have to go through this.

758
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:41,125
We don't... [chuckles]

759
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:46,375
- So you're ready to leave?
- [breathes deeply]

760

Believe me,

761
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:50,958
if I thought I could, I would.

762
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:53,291
Even if it meant pretending.

763
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:56,625
[chuckles] But I tried that.
I already tried to do that.

764
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,291
And I ended up here. So what am I...

765
00:44:00,541 --> 00:44:03,708
What am I supposed to...
I'm just supposed to go back to work?

766
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:06,791
Do you know what I do for a living?
You know what my job is?

767
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:08,291
Yes. You are a teacher.

768
00:44:08,375 --> 00:44:10,250
I'm a grade school art teacher.

769
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:13,333
So...

770
00:44:15,666 --> 00:44:18,291
So you go
and look at those kids every day.

771
00:44:19,416 --> 00:44:20,541
You try doing that.

772
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,791
And what about your wife?
I'm sure she'd like to have you home.

773
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:29,958
[breathes deeply]

774
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:35,375
You know, a few years back,

775
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:37,250
[chuckles]

776
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:40,166
I joined this Frisbee league.

777
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:41,833
I don't know.

778
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:43,250
[nostalgic music playing]

779
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:44,750
And Lilly, my wife,

780
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:46,625
she felt left out,

781
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:50,541
so she insisted that
she become our sole cheerleader.

782
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:54,708
Just to be clear, Frisbee leagues
do not have cheerleaders,

783
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:56,750
or indeed, spectators.

784
00:44:59,041 --> 00:45:01,250
But there she'd be with her pom-poms.

785
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,916
I'd make out like I was this jock.

786
00:45:05,416 --> 00:45:09,958
[laughing] She got me
this letterman jacket.

787
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,583
And we... [inhales]

788
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:13,791
It was so dumb.

789
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:18,416
I don't know how to get back there.

790
00:45:21,458 --> 00:45:22,833
I can't be

791
00:45:24,166 --> 00:45:25,708
who I was for her.

792
00:45:29,875 --> 00:45:32,458

Can we do that? We just...

801
00:45:54,291 --> 00:45:56,166
It's okay then? [sighs]

802
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:57,833
It's okay for me to stay?

803
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:03,375

for the record that I...

816
00:46:36,416 --> 00:46:39,375

That I killed her...

00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:36,125
[sighs]

867
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
This whole thing,

868
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:41,458
it... it's not about Katie.

869
00:49:42,083 --> 00:49:44,250
You'll talk about her, you know?

870
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:46,791
It's about Jack and you. Jack and you.

871
00:49:46,875 --> 00:49:50,000
How do you restart?
How do you have a marriage, now?

872
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:57,416
Why... Why was Jack admitted
to the hospital?

873
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:00,875
He, um...

874
00:50:04,416 --> 00:50:05,500
He... He was...

875
00:50:07,375 --> 00:50:11,333
[Lilly] <i>He hadn't been sleeping well. Um...</i>

876

<i>Yeah, he just wanted to go to sleep</i>

880
00:50:34,458 --> 00:50:35,708
and not wake up.

881
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:37,291
Like Katie.

882
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:42,333
You must've been pretty angry.

883
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,958
I wasn't angry.

884
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:47,333
No, he was depressed.

885
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:49,958
He... He had every reason to be.

886
00:50:50,583 --> 00:50:53,708
So did you,
and you didn't try to end your life

887
00:50:53,791 --> 00:50:55,916
and leave your husband behind.

888
00:50:56,583 --> 00:50:57,583
Alone.

889
00:51:00,416 --> 00:51:01,750
You blame yourself.

890
00:51:02,541 --> 00:51:04,458
Who's to say anybody's to blame?

891
00:51:04,541 --> 00:51:06,583
- I do.
- Oh, that's shitty, Larry.

892
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:10,541
Not 'cause it's right or wrong, or good
or bad, but because that's what we do.

893
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:16,375
We can't stand the idea of something
so tragic happening for no reason at all.

894
00:51:16,458 --> 00:51:19,333
So... You know, and...
and emotions have to find a way out,

895
00:51:19,416 --> 00:51:23,333
and they always do.
So we kick the cat, or we kick the dog,

896
00:51:23,416 --> 00:51:24,750
or poison a bird.

897
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:27,500
And worst of all,

898
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:29,916
we turn on ourselves.

899
00:51:31,666 --> 00:51:34,625

Does Jack know how you feel?

902

Bathroom's down the hall to the left.

903
00:52:05,041 --> 00:52:06,208
Talk to him, Lilly.

[Lilly] Do you like it, being here?

907
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,416
[Jack] Do I like it?

908
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,208
You know, is it helping?

909
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:34,750
Uh...

910
00:52:35,416 --> 00:52:36,583
Yeah.

911
00:52:36,666 --> 00:52:37,833
Yeah, I... I guess.

912
00:52:38,833 --> 00:52:40,791
I thought maybe
we could go up to the lake again,

913
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:43,041
when you get home.
You know, for the Fourth.

914
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:45,875
- Sure. Yeah.
- That's fun, right?

915
00:52:46,541 --> 00:52:49,291
Yeah, it'll be just like it was,
like nothing ever happened.

916
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:51,083
I didn't say that.

917
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:52,166
- No, I know.
- I...

918
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:54,333
No, but that is why I'm here,
isn't it? I'm...

919
00:52:54,416 --> 00:52:57,333
I'm supposed to just go back
to being my good old self,

920
00:52:57,416 --> 00:52:58,958
and we can all get on with our lives.

921
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:02,017
- It's just gonna take time, that's all.
- [Jack] Don't, don't, don't. Please.

922
00:53:02,041 --> 00:53:04,541
I mean... You really think

923
00:53:04,625 --> 00:53:07,916
that time is gonna make all of this okay?
It's gonna make us okay?

924
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,958
I'm not saying that. I'm just saying
that we can't stay here like this.

925
00:53:12,041 --> 00:53:13,666
- This is not good.
- I know.

926
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:17,458
But I don't know how I fit anymore.

927
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:21,083
I don't know how we fit,

928
00:53:21,916 --> 00:53:24,208
how any of it works. [chuckles]

929
00:53:24,791 --> 00:53:27,291
I... I'm... I'm just not like you, Lilly.

930
00:53:27,375 --> 00:53:29,041
You're not like me?

931
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:33,375
I carried her inside me for nine months.

932
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,416
So why are you here?

933
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:40,875
- Why did I sleep in that morning?
- Don't do that!

934
00:53:40,958 --> 00:53:43,083
I could've just gone over
and woken her up.

935
00:53:43,166 --> 00:53:44,708
I could've done something.

936
00:53:45,208 --> 00:53:46,916
But I overslept.

937
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:51,791
Every morning, when I wake up,
the first thing I hear is our baby crying.

938
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:54,541
And in that brief moment,

939
00:53:54,625 --> 00:53:56,958
I get to imagine that I just wake up.

940
00:53:58,041 --> 00:53:59,750
Like I always did.

941
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:03,500
That precious moment of agony,

942
00:54:03,583 --> 00:54:05,375
it's the highlight of my day.

943
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:10,083
So please, don't talk to me about time,

944
00:54:11,208 --> 00:54:13,416
because I've got loads of it, Lilly.

945
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:16,791
And I hate it. It never ends.

946
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:19,625
- [whispering] Honey, please.
- I wish I knew how to stop.

947

- I wish. I don't.

00:54:25,583 --> 00:54:27,291

I didn't know what to do.

I just kept staring at her closed door.

953
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,500
I got rid of all of her things.

954
00:54:43,375 --> 00:54:44,625
I just couldn't.

955

- You should go, I think.

- I'm sorry, I...
- [Jack] No, I think...

957
00:54:48,708 --> 00:54:50,791
I don't know why I did it. I...

958
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:52,541
I should've asked you.

I'm not a v... visitor. I'm his wife.

Did you look up

Yes. And maybe you could've mentioned
that he also treats poodles.

998

He'd never tell you this,

00:59:35,375 --> 00:59:36,541
What?

1036
00:59:36,625 --> 00:59:39,916
Give him his medicine.
Twice a day, with food.

1037
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,666
And no more truck-stop food.
Dry food only.

1038
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:44,833
- Okay?
- Okay, I got it.

1039
00:59:44,916 --> 00:59:45,833
I mean it.

1040
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:49,541
Okay, I will tell him.
Hey. Hey, you hear that?

1041
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:51,916
Hey, hey, no more nachos.

1042
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,833
No more corn bread. Huh?

1043
00:59:53,916 --> 00:59:56,333
No more corn dogs.
And no more Cheetos. [crying]

1044
00:59:56,416 --> 01:00:00,416
Don't look at me like that.
Why are you looking at me?

1045
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:06,625
- Your mom really isn't here?
- She's coming back to get me later.

1046
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:08,791
Yeah, well, let's wait for her, okay?

1047
01:00:08,875 --> 01:00:11,708
I know what you're gonna say.
She gets tired all the time.

1048
01:00:12,333 --> 01:00:14,750
My brother says she's getting skinny too.

1049
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:17,250
See, it's, uh...

1050
01:00:18,125 --> 01:00:19,125
[sighs]

1051
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,583
She's in a lot of pain,

1052
01:00:20,625 --> 01:00:22,916
and the quality of her life is...
is... is going to...

1053
01:00:23,416 --> 01:00:26,791
I'm talking about the quality of her life.
I'm talking about the quality of life

1054
01:00:26,875 --> 01:00:29,666
to a ten-year-old.
Did Howie's mom not say anything about...

1055
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:32,500
I told you. She signed off on it.
She's coming back later.

1056
01:00:32,583 --> 01:00:34,416
- Okay?
- [boy] It's not her fault.

1057
01:00:35,125 --> 01:00:37,125
She's not good with these things.

1058
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,500
[inhales deeply]

1059
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,708
Are you sure there's nothing?

1060
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:47,083
I'm sure.

1061
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,500
It's okay.

1062
01:00:54,166 --> 01:00:55,166
[kisses]

1063
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:59,041
[telephone ringing]

1064
01:01:00,416 --> 01:01:01,416
[door locks]

1065
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:05,708
You've got to stop
with the just-showing-up business.

1066
01:01:05,791 --> 01:01:07,750
I need a favor, Larry.

1067
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:10,458
He won't see me,
and they won't even let me talk to him.

1068
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:12,458
- Well, that's within his rights.
- So I hear.

1069
01:01:12,541 --> 01:01:15,500
But I... I... I was thinking that
you could call Regina or someone.

1070
01:01:15,583 --> 01:01:16,500
Doesn't work that way.

1071
01:01:16,583 --> 01:01:19,208
But you know how it does work,
and you must have some...

1072
01:01:19,291 --> 01:01:21,166
some kind of credentials still, right?

1073
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:24,083
- This isn't the best time, Lilly.
- Well, no shit, Larry.

1074
01:01:24,166 --> 01:01:28,333
I've been scratched off the guest list
in a mental hospital by my own husband.

1075
01:01:28,416 --> 01:01:30,958
- [drawer slams loudly]
- Here's what you do.

1076
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:33,250
Go and talk to Fawn
and make an appointment.

1077
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:34,375
Make an appointment?

1078
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:37,541
Aren't you supposed to be helping me?
Isn't that what this is?

1079
01:01:38,083 --> 01:01:40,750
Non-therapy therapy,

1080
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:44,041
pretend therapy, whatever?
Isn't that what we've been doing?

1081
01:01:44,125 --> 01:01:48,125
- What, am I on this island all alone?
- I'm not a therapist anymore.

1082
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:50,750
And I am certainly not your therapist.

1083
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:52,750
You got that right.

1084
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:55,166
Because you're a shit one.

1085
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,416
Maybe that's why you quit.

1086
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,833
I mean, what is it that makes

1087
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:01,833
this so much better, huh?

1088
01:02:01,916 --> 01:02:04,416
'Cause wha... Is it 'cause
cats don't talk back?

1089
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,500
[clattering]

1090
01:02:06,208 --> 01:02:09,625
[Dr. Larry] No, they don't.
They do, however, make appointments.

1091
01:02:09,708 --> 01:02:10,708
[taps table]

1092
01:02:11,458 --> 01:02:13,541
What do you want from me? [stuttering]

1093
01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:16,458
You... You want some kind of answer?

1094
01:02:16,541 --> 01:02:18,583
You want me to say
everything's gonna be okay?

1095
01:02:18,666 --> 01:02:19,666
Yeah.

1096
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:21,291
Yeah, Larry. I...

1097
01:02:21,791 --> 01:02:24,500
Answers are good. People want answers.

1098
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:26,291
I don't have the answers.

1099
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,625
I never did. I just talked.

1100
01:02:29,708 --> 01:02:33,291
And the moment I figured that out,
I quit and stopped pretending.

1101
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:37,166
You think you can fix Jack?
You think that's the solution?

1102
01:02:39,916 --> 01:02:41,416
What am I supposed to do?

1103
01:02:42,666 --> 01:02:44,000
I'm supposed to quit?

1104
01:02:44,791 --> 01:02:45,833
Like him?

1105
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Or like you?

1106
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:52,125
At least quitting is an active choice.

1107
01:02:53,041 --> 01:02:54,041
Why don't we quit?

1108
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:56,208
I'm so sorry.
I never should've started this.

1109
01:02:56,291 --> 01:02:57,291
It's my fault.

1110
01:02:57,833 --> 01:03:01,375
Let's just agree
to not do this anymore, okay?

1111
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:08,250
Sure thing, Larry.

1112
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:15,125
[slams chair loudly]

1113
01:03:16,208 --> 01:03:18,208

1120
01:03:53,416 --> 01:03:54,916
[starling continues squawking]

1121
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:57,416
You son of a bitch!

1122

[breathes heavily]

1123
01:04:01,125 --> 01:04:02,416

[starling warbles]

1125
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:11,583
Okay, you little shit.
Here comes the pain.

1126
01:04:13,666 --> 01:04:16,041
- [starling warbling]
- Ow! God!

1127
01:04:21,833 --> 01:04:22,958
[exhales]

1128
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:25,541

Oh God.

Hi, Jack.

[womanon TV] <i>That was
the takeaway for me.</i>

1154
01:05:53,708 --> 01:05:55,958
<i>Because there were so many men.</i>

- Can I play?
- [girl] Okay.

1176

- I'm the lion tamer.
- Oh, and a good one.

1177

How about I'm... I'm just another lion?

- [boy] I'm a tiger.
- Oh, you're a tiger!

Do you... Do you have a roar?

- Roar!
- [Jack] Oh!

1181
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,416
You frightened the life out of me.
That was really good.

1182
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,720
Well, if we're a circus, we're gonna need
some more animals, I think.

1183

Uh, I spy a giraffe.

1184

Hey, Mel. You're a giraffe.
[chuckles] Come on. You're a giraffe.

- All right, I'm a giraffe.
- You're a giraffe.

Okay, we've got our giraffe.

Oh! Who's that playing in the mud?

1189

I found our elephant!
We need an elephant, don't we?

1190
01:07:06,666 --> 01:07:09,625
Bob, you're gonna be an elephant.
[trumpets] Can you do it?

- Come on, giraffe.
- [Mel] All right.

1194
01:07:14,416 --> 01:07:17,166
We've got our lion tamer
to tell us what to do, okay?

1195
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:18,541
Can we do the sounds.

1196
01:07:18,625 --> 01:07:20,425
What's the sound?
What is the sound like, Bob?

How about our tiger? [roars, chuckles]

1200

01:15:58,333 --> 01:15:59,875
- No.
- What about a coffee stir straw?

1365
01:15:59,958 --> 01:16:02,125
- Good idea.
- Have you not done this before?

1366
01:16:02,208 --> 01:16:03,541
No, I haven't. Have you?

1367
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:06,041
- You wanna wait for a specialist?
- Is that an option?

1368
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:08,208
I'd love to,
cause you're talking coffee stir straws.

1369
01:16:08,291 --> 01:16:10,642
- Could you wait outside, Lilly?
- No! I won't wait outside!

1370
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:12,416
- Out, out, out!
- [Fawn] Go, please.

1371
01:16:12,958 --> 01:16:14,750
- What do you need?
- Uh...

1372
01:16:14,833 --> 01:16:19,083
[sighs] Well, uh, surgical soap,
sterile drape, and, uh, vodka.

1373
01:16:19,166 --> 01:16:20,208
Vodka?

1374
01:16:20,791 --> 01:16:22,208
Oh, for you.

1375
01:16:22,791 --> 01:16:24,750
- We have a bottle of gin.
- That'll do.

1376
01:16:34,875 --> 01:16:36,208
[nostalgic music playing]

1377
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:38,500
[nurse] Jack?

1379
01:16:59,333 --> 01:17:00,416

[inhales deeply]

1390
01:19:02,208 --> 01:19:06,416
[Regina] Tonight, I'd like to talk about
the importance of being honest.

1391
01:19:07,041 --> 01:19:08,333
With ourselves.

1392
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,625
Velma, would you like to start?

1393
01:19:11,666 --> 01:19:14,458
- I'm sick of all the damn talkin'.
- [Regina] Okay.

1394
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:15,833
That was honest.

1395
01:19:15,916 --> 01:19:16,916
[Jack] I'll go.

1396
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:19,916
If, uh, if that's okay.

1397
01:19:21,166 --> 01:19:22,708
- Yes, of course.
- [pulls chair]

1398
01:19:27,041 --> 01:19:28,041
Um...

1399
01:19:28,625 --> 01:19:29,708
[inhales deeply]

1400
01:19:34,041 --> 01:19:36,166
I'm depressed. That's why I'm here.

1401
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:41,666
[chuckles]

1402
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,500
[laughing]

1403
01:19:46,458 --> 01:19:49,333
Um, my little girl passed away.

1404
01:19:50,541 --> 01:19:53,833
And then I tried to pass myself away.

1405
01:19:54,583 --> 01:19:55,458
[chuckles]

1406
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:58,708
That's not funny.
But that is what I tried to do.

1407
01:19:59,458 --> 01:20:02,833
And I thought it was because of Katie.
Uh, that was my...

1408
01:20:04,541 --> 01:20:06,666
That is my daughter's name. Katie.

1409
01:20:09,458 --> 01:20:11,958
But if I'm being honest with myself,

1410
01:20:12,041 --> 01:20:15,583
I have been in and out of this state
since I was in my 20s.

1411
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:19,416
And I don't know how to get out of it.

1412
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
I, um...

1413
01:20:22,916 --> 01:20:26,000
I've been to therapists.
I've taken the medication.

1414
01:20:26,583 --> 01:20:30,041
And sometimes, it works.
It does feel a bit better.

1415
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:31,625
And then after a while,

1416
01:20:33,291 --> 01:20:34,291
I quit.

1417
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:40,583
Because I don't need that shit.

1418
01:20:40,666 --> 01:20:46,666
[chuckles] Because...
I can deal with my own life.

1419
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:47,750
[chuckles]

1420
01:20:50,791 --> 01:20:53,750
Quit on myself so fast.

1421
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:57,750
And then I quit on the people who love me.

1422
01:20:58,666 --> 01:21:00,958
I mean, my wife. [chuckles]

1423
01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:03,500
[imitating Borat] "My wife."

1424
01:21:05,041 --> 01:21:06,083
[chuckles]

1425
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:09,208
My wife wouldn't know how to quit.

1426
01:21:12,083 --> 01:21:13,916
Wouldn't know where to start.

1427
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:15,833
She just keeps at it.

1428
01:21:15,916 --> 01:21:18,833
Just keeps hoping and believing

1429
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:22,750
and moving around in the world.
And I hate her for it.

1430
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:24,833
[inspirational music playing]

1431
01:21:26,791 --> 01:21:30,208
And I love her so much for it
at the same time.

1432
01:21:32,833 --> 01:21:33,833
So much that...

1433
01:21:35,583 --> 01:21:38,416
I wanna not quit with her.

1434
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:42,125
Not <i>for</i> her.

1435
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:43,208
[sniffles]

1436
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:47,916
I wanna not quit with her.

1437
01:21:51,708 --> 01:21:53,708
[laughing]

1438
01:21:58,583 --> 01:22:00,166
Yeah, so that's my day.

1439
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:02,291
Um...

1440
01:22:04,791 --> 01:22:05,916
a happy day.

1441
01:22:09,416 --> 01:22:10,458
[chuckles]

1442
01:22:10,958 --> 01:22:12,166
[Velma sighs]

1443
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:13,916
Jack.

1444
01:22:15,083 --> 01:22:16,583
[crying] You asshole.

1445
01:22:17,708 --> 01:22:18,708
Tissue.

1446
01:22:19,833 --> 01:22:20,833
I know.

1447
01:22:22,083 --> 01:22:24,333
- [crying]
- Thanks for sharing, Jack.

1448
01:22:29,041 --> 01:22:32,333
Might as well take him home. There's
no point in staying here all night.

1449
01:22:32,416 --> 01:22:33,250
What do I do?

1450
01:22:33,333 --> 01:22:36,458
Uh, just try to get a couple drops of this

1451
01:22:36,541 --> 01:22:39,625
into his throat
every couple of hours if you can.

1452
01:22:39,708 --> 01:22:40,625
Will he wake up?

1453
01:22:40,708 --> 01:22:43,333
[crickets chirping]

1454
01:22:43,416 --> 01:22:44,666
It's hard to say.

1455
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:49,500
- What's on his wings?
- They're bound so he can't fly away.

1456
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,583
You know, even if he does wake up,
I... I might still have to...

1457
01:22:55,583 --> 01:22:56,416
[sighs]

1458
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:59,083
If the wound doesn't heal,
he won't be able to protect himself.

1459
01:22:59,166 --> 01:23:01,125
It wouldn't be fair to send him out there...

1460
01:23:01,208 --> 01:23:03,458
[breathes deeply] ...like this on his own.

1461
01:23:05,125 --> 01:23:06,125
Huh.

1462
01:23:06,916 --> 01:23:08,291
Funny how that works.

1463
01:23:08,875 --> 01:23:10,208
How what works?

1464
01:23:10,291 --> 01:23:12,833
Oh, just the idea of this little guy
trying to survive

1465
01:23:12,916 --> 01:23:15,333
out there in the cruel world
all by himself.

1466
01:23:15,416 --> 01:23:16,750
[inhales deeply]

1467
01:23:16,833 --> 01:23:19,250
Starlings are different than other birds.

1468
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:22,625
When they mate,
they... they build a nest together,

1469
01:23:22,708 --> 01:23:24,458
and they protect the nest.

1470
01:23:25,041 --> 01:23:26,041
Together.

1471
01:23:26,583 --> 01:23:28,875
They even feed the hatchlings together.

1472
01:23:29,458 --> 01:23:33,541
They're just not meant to exist
in the world alone,

1473
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:35,791
on their own.

1474
01:23:39,791 --> 01:23:41,500
Real subtle stuff, Larry.

1475
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,125
[Larry chuckles] I thought so.

1476
01:23:50,583 --> 01:23:53,625
[joyful classical music playing]

1477
01:23:53,708 --> 01:23:55,458
[whispering] Okay, that's enough.

1478
01:23:56,333 --> 01:23:57,333
Okay.

1479
01:23:57,958 --> 01:23:59,208
Maybe just a little.

1480
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:08,916
[humming]

1481
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:11,666
You know you like this.

01:24:17,083 --> 01:24:18,583
[Dickey cawing]

1483
01:24:20,833 --> 01:24:22,083
[cawing]

1484
01:24:25,916 --> 01:24:29,500
I read that if you talk to somebody
in a coma, it can help them heal faster.

01:24:29,583 --> 01:24:31,166
[music becomes louder and intensifies]

1487
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:38,208
Come on. Come on.

1488
01:24:39,958 --> 01:24:41,708
[cell phone ringing]

1489
01:24:44,291 --> 01:24:45,375
[switches off music]

1490
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Hello?

1491
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:50,000
[Jack breathing heavily]

1492
01:24:50,916 --> 01:24:53,500
- [inhales sharply]
- [Lilly] <i>I'm a little busy here, Jack,</i>

1493
01:24:53,583 --> 01:24:56,666
<i>so I don't really have time to listen
to you breathe.</i>

1494
01:24:57,291 --> 01:25:00,208
You know that you're not the only one
in pain, right?

1495
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:04,791
I mean, ever since Katie left us,
it's been...

1496
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:07,375
And then you did what you did.

1497
01:25:07,458 --> 01:25:09,416
Which is not okay, Jack.

1498
01:25:10,125 --> 01:25:13,916
<i>I've been holding down
the fort for a year and...</i>

1499
01:25:14,708 --> 01:25:16,041
I haven't had five minutes

1500
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:18,541
to think about my own feelings.

1501
01:25:18,625 --> 01:25:20,708
We never seem to
get around to that, right?

1502
01:25:20,791 --> 01:25:24,000
<i>Which is pretty fucking selfish,
isn't it, Jack?</i>

1503
01:25:24,083 --> 01:25:26,958
<i>So when you get back, shit's gonna change.</i>

1504
01:25:27,041 --> 01:25:28,333
Things are gonna be said,

1505
01:25:28,416 --> 01:25:29,625
tears are gonna be shed,

1506
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:33,250
and then we're gonna move on and move up.

1507
01:25:33,333 --> 01:25:35,708
And we're gonna find a different

1508
01:25:35,791 --> 01:25:38,416
but even better life than the one we had

1509
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:42,583
because I am not interested
in some kind of lateral move.

[soft classical music playing]

1511
01:25:45,583 --> 01:25:49,916
And you're gonna say sorry
to me for trying to take you from me.

1512
01:25:53,875 --> 01:25:56,000
You're gonna say it every day. [sniffles]

1513
01:25:56,083 --> 01:25:58,267
You're gonna say it every day
for the rest of our lives.

1514
01:25:58,291 --> 01:26:00,875
That's gonna be a very long, long time.
[chuckles, sniffles]

[inhales deeply]

1518
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:14,166
So I'm gonna hang up on you now,
because that'd make us even-steven...

1519
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:16,708
[sniffles] ...'cause you hung up on me, so...

1520
01:26:18,625 --> 01:26:20,125
Besides, I've gotta go feed...

You're married, right? I mean,
I'm assuming you're married.

1529
01:27:00,208 --> 01:27:03,041
[sniffles] At least, are monogamous?

1530
01:27:03,125 --> 01:27:04,291
At least? I don't know.

1531
01:27:04,375 --> 01:27:06,916
Are birds monogamous?
