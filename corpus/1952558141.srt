1
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:09,110
What's up?

2
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:11,150
Yeah!

3
00:01:11,751 --> 00:01:13,184
Yeah!

4
00:01:14,271 --> 00:01:16,785
What's up, Johannesburg?

5
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:20,548
What's up, New York?

6
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:24,181
What's up, London?

7
00:01:25,991 --> 00:01:30,382
Ah! Yes, I'm in Jo'burg!

8
00:01:30,471 --> 00:01:32,507
I finally made it!

9
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:38,789
Whoo! Now let's hope I make it
the fuck out of here.

10
00:01:40,871 --> 00:01:43,669
Cos it is violent right about now!

11
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:46,629
And I ain't talking about the jungle.

12
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:49,384
Man, oh, man, it's good to be here, man!

13
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:51,826
It is so good to be here.

14
00:01:55,631 --> 00:01:58,589
The first time
I'm ever playing Africa.

15
00:01:58,671 --> 00:02:01,231
Africa, first time playing
Africa, South Africa.

16
00:02:01,311 --> 00:02:05,020
I was on safari with my family,
out there taking pictures of the animals.

17
00:02:05,111 --> 00:02:09,946
And you're driving around, and you
got this guy what you call the tracker.

18
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:13,068
The tracker is amazing
cos you just driving around

19
00:02:13,151 --> 00:02:16,621
and the tracker goes,
"Stop, stop, stop, stop."

20
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:19,145
And you stop the jeep
and he leans down

21
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:22,541
and puts his finger
in some piss.

22
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:24,189
He's like...

23
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:30,546
"15 miles to the right should be zebra."

24
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:36,348
And you get there and there's zebra!

25
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:40,308
There's zebra! Wow! Zebra!

26
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:42,985
And you drivin' some more
and "Stop, stop, stop."

27
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:46,427
Then he leans down and picks up
a little shit pellet and...

28
00:02:47,271 --> 00:02:50,069
"Mmm! Ah! Mmm..."

29
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:54,383
"13 miles to the left, rhinoceros."

30
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:57,224
And you get there and
there's a rhino right there!

31
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,950
You're like, "How the fuck's he do this shit?"

32
00:03:00,031 --> 00:03:01,544
And it was beautiful.

33
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:05,544
I'm out there taking pictures of the rhino,
I took the pictures of the zebra.

34
00:03:05,631 --> 00:03:09,385
And I was having a good time and I'm out
there with my family and I felt great,

35
00:03:09,471 --> 00:03:11,268
till I looked over at another jeep

36
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:14,184
and I saw a bunch of white people
taking pictures of me.

37
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:26,745
I didn't see a...
Hey, I ain't no animal!

38
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:30,346
But they had a tracker
tracking my black ass.

39
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:34,947
Evidently, I musta dropped
some chicken or su'um at another spot,

40
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:40,788
and they're like, "Ah, chicken bone.
13 miles to the left, niggers will be there."

41
00:03:45,471 --> 00:03:49,384
This is a crazy time, man.
This is the time to be onstage.

42
00:03:49,471 --> 00:03:51,587
This is the time to do a special, man.

43
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:53,229
Cos this is a special time.

44
00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:55,779
A lot's going on right now, that's right.

45
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:59,022
Big election year in the United States.

46
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:03,821
It ain't your election, but you paying
attention. You damn right you are.

47
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,469
That's right.

48
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:08,509
George Bush has fucked up so bad...

49
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:12,550
he made it hard for a white man
to run for president.

50
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:28,622
People are like,
"Give me a black man, a white woman,

51
00:04:28,711 --> 00:04:33,660
"a giraffe, a zebra,
anything but another white man!

52
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:36,504
"That last one fucked up my roof."

53
00:04:37,191 --> 00:04:41,184
Now who do we have running for president?
Who the hell is running for president?

54
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:44,581
We got two guys, man.
We got John McCain.

55
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:48,505
John McCain, 72 years old.

56
00:04:48,591 --> 00:04:51,583
He was too old 10 years ago.

57
00:04:53,511 --> 00:04:55,388
72!

58
00:04:55,471 --> 00:04:58,508
He's so old, he used to own Sidney Poitier.

59
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:07,780
Come on, man. I don't need
a president with a bucket list.

60
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:15,300
72 years old!

61
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:21,580
My God. How many 72-year-old people
did you see today just doing shit?

62
00:05:23,911 --> 00:05:28,029
72... Old people don't even use old people
to do shit.

63
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:30,671
Seventy-fuckin'-two.

64
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:34,630
Two! You see he hired his nurse
to be his vice president too.

65
00:05:43,191 --> 00:05:45,546
What the fuck is on her mind?

66
00:05:45,631 --> 00:05:49,226
Sarah Palin, out there
shooting mooses and shit,

67
00:05:49,311 --> 00:05:51,825
and holding up the moose and shit.

68
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:53,424
I see her holding a dead moose,

69
00:05:53,511 --> 00:05:56,503
I'm like, "What the fuck is
Michael Vick in jail for?"

70
00:06:00,911 --> 00:06:05,621
She shot a moose!
What the fuck?

71
00:06:05,711 --> 00:06:07,429
My God!

72
00:06:07,511 --> 00:06:11,026
John McCain, how you gonna
make decisions about the future

73
00:06:11,111 --> 00:06:13,067
when you ain't gonna be here?

74
00:06:16,231 --> 00:06:18,222
He's old!

75
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,267
The motherfucker's too old.

76
00:06:20,351 --> 00:06:23,900
When you die at 72,
no matter what you die of,

77
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:25,663
it's natural causes.

78
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:31,464
Even if you get hit by a truck,
it's natural causes.

79
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:34,543
Cos if you was younger,
you'd have got out the way.

80
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:40,981
Then, you know, you got a real choice, man,
Barack or McCain.

81
00:06:41,071 --> 00:06:44,268
They tryin' to...
McCain just got that old story.

82
00:06:44,351 --> 00:06:48,663
This motherfucker been telling the
same story for 40 fuckin' years.

83
00:06:48,751 --> 00:06:50,707
He a war hero.

84
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,669
He a war hero.
He a war hero...

85
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:55,230
that got captured.

86
00:06:59,111 --> 00:07:01,625
There's a lot of guys
in jail that got captured.

87
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,183
Shit.

88
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:11,947
Fuck that. I don't want to vote
for nobody that got captured.

89
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:15,182
I want to vote for the motherfucker
that got away.

90
00:07:16,751 --> 00:07:18,548
That's what we got, man.

91
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:22,590
So who's he running up against?
Barack Obama.

92
00:07:27,391 --> 00:07:30,463
Barack Obama, man.

93
00:07:32,311 --> 00:07:35,064
Barack Obama!

94
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:37,711
Yes! Black man!

95
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,662
With a black name.

96
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:45,903
I know it ain't that black here, but in America,
that's about as black as a name could get.

97
00:07:46,951 --> 00:07:49,146
Barack Obama.

98
00:07:49,231 --> 00:07:51,870
That's right next to
Dekimbe Mutombo.

99
00:07:55,111 --> 00:07:58,945
That's right, Barack, man,
he don't let his blackness sneak up on you.

100
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:01,226
If his name was Bob Jones or something,

101
00:08:01,311 --> 00:08:05,145
it might take you two or three weeks
to realise he black.

102
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:08,223
But as soon as you hear
"Barack Obama",

103
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:11,667
you expect to see
a brother with a spear...

104
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:18,267
just standing on top of a dead lion.

105
00:08:19,871 --> 00:08:21,907
Barack Obama!

106
00:08:21,991 --> 00:08:27,111
You expect to see the bass player
from The Commodores come out.

107
00:08:37,031 --> 00:08:38,987
I'm not talking about Lionel Richie.

108
00:08:39,071 --> 00:08:41,869
I'm talking about them
shining niggers behind him.

109
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:51,903
Barack Obama. We ain't never seen a brother
like Barack Obama.

110
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:54,949
Nice-looking brother, young. Young!

111
00:08:55,031 --> 00:08:59,309
Every time I see Barack, I'm like,
"So when you getting back with New Edition?"

112
00:09:00,951 --> 00:09:03,067
This young brother. My God.

113
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:05,984
And Barack is so calm and cool.

114
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:11,099
Sometimes I think he doesn't even realise
he's the black candidate.

115
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:14,945
Like he thinks he could
win this thing fair and square.

116
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:20,706
Like he thinks having the most votes
is gonna mean su'um.

117
00:09:27,431 --> 00:09:29,228
Shit!

118
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:33,907
They will change this whole system
on his black ass overnight?

119
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:37,586
You better ask the Indians
about white men and rules.

120
00:09:38,991 --> 00:09:41,141
They will change all this shit.

121
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:44,303
With a straight face too.
"Hey, man, you got the most votes.

122
00:09:44,391 --> 00:09:46,188
"Too bad you lost.

123
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:50,143
"That's how we used to do it. Ha-ha!

124
00:09:50,231 --> 00:09:53,143
"We don't really count votes
that much no more."

125
00:09:53,231 --> 00:09:55,187
They don't give a fuck, boy.

126
00:09:55,271 --> 00:09:57,227
And they in Barack's ass.

127
00:09:57,311 --> 00:10:00,508
Whoever Barack know is being investigated.

128
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:05,062
If you know Barack Obama,
they are tapping your phone right now.

129
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:06,664
They are in your ass.

130
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:10,744
And that's where McCain has the advantage
cos all his friends are dead.

131
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:22,186
Yeah, man, but this whole election is so...
is so weird.

132
00:10:22,271 --> 00:10:25,661
Just the way they report on it,
the way they cover it.

133
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:28,424
Everything's so racial, racial, racial.

134
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:31,628
"How many white people are voting?
How many working-class white people?

135
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:34,669
"How many white people over 4'8"
are voting for Obama?"

136
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:36,901
You know?
And the crazy thing is,

137
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:41,860
whenever white people vote for Barack Obama,
which is a lot of the time, they go,

138
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:45,068
"Well, you know, they listened to the issues

139
00:10:45,151 --> 00:10:48,427
"and they felt Obama spoke to their issues.

140
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:52,220
"They went over the issues,
they weighed the pros and cons,

141
00:10:52,311 --> 00:10:56,065
"and they felt that Obama
spoke to their issues."

142
00:10:56,151 --> 00:10:58,790
And whenever black people
vote for Barack, they go,

143
00:10:58,871 --> 00:11:02,181
"Well, they black, he black,
I guess that's why."

144
00:11:03,191 --> 00:11:07,184
Like we don't even have
names on our ballots and shit.

145
00:11:07,271 --> 00:11:10,547
Like it's just scratch 'n' sniff on our ballots.

146
00:11:10,631 --> 00:11:13,020
Like it's just pictures of milkshakes.

147
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:16,706
"No. Strawberry?
No, chocolate! Chocolate.

148
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:20,384
"I vote chocolate.
That's what I want."

149
00:11:22,671 --> 00:11:24,627
Don't get me wrong.
Don't get me wrong.

150
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:27,623
We are very excited
about Barack Obama.

151
00:11:27,711 --> 00:11:31,067
Black people are very excited
about Barack Obama.

152
00:11:33,631 --> 00:11:36,543
But we're not just voting
for him cos he's black.

153
00:11:36,631 --> 00:11:39,907
We're voting for him
because he's black and qualified.

154
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,869
That's why we're voting
for the motherfucker, yeah!

155
00:11:42,951 --> 00:11:45,988
That's... That's why we behind him.

156
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:49,347
You know, it's not like
we're voting for Flavor Flav.

157
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:54,219
Yeah, boy!

158
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:57,826
Flavor Flav!

159
00:11:57,911 --> 00:12:01,221
I love Flavor. Loved him for 20 years.

160
00:12:01,311 --> 00:12:03,222
I love the Flavor Of Love show.

161
00:12:03,311 --> 00:12:05,461
I think it's quite entertaining.

162
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:08,861
But Flavor Flav must be killed.

163
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:14,546
In order for black people
to truly reach the promised land,

164
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:17,304
Flavor Flav has to be shot.

165
00:12:18,351 --> 00:12:22,139
These are important times.
We got a black man running for president.

166
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:27,589
We don't need a nigger with a fucking clock
around his neck and a Viking hat on his head.

167
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,340
Not this year, Flavor.
Put a suit on, nigger.

168
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,387
Put a suit on!

169
00:12:36,471 --> 00:12:39,702
Not this year, Flav.
Not this year.

170
00:12:40,911 --> 00:12:45,348
No, no, no. But we're very...
We're very, very, very excited, man.

171
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,662
I'll tell you this right now,
white people that are here.

172
00:12:48,751 --> 00:12:50,867
If Barack Obama wins,

173
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:54,626
if you have any activity in your life

174
00:12:54,711 --> 00:12:56,747
that involves black people

175
00:12:56,831 --> 00:13:01,063
that is supposed to happen
the day after election day,

176
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:03,585
it will not get done.

177
00:13:07,431 --> 00:13:09,467
Election day's a Tuesday.

178
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:12,941
That Wednesday,
don't schedule no black shit.

179
00:13:14,431 --> 00:13:18,470
Like, if you gotta fly,
ain't nobody carrying your bags.

180
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:21,861
You got to get your own
motherfuckin' bag.

181
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:24,385
We got a black president,
motherfucker.

182
00:13:25,951 --> 00:13:27,304
Shit.

183
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:39,466
It's going to be hard for Barack Obama
to be president, man.

184
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:42,588
Cos Barack Obama has to
overcome a handicap

185
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:45,504
that the other candidate
does not have to overcome.

186
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:49,789
That's right. It's gonna be hard
for Barack Obama to be president

187
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:53,784
because Barack Obama
has a black wife.

188
00:13:57,351 --> 00:14:02,300
And I don't think a black woman
can be first lady of the United States.

189
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:04,382
Yeah, I said it.

190
00:14:05,551 --> 00:14:08,111
I said it in Johannesburg,
I said it.

191
00:14:08,191 --> 00:14:11,501
I said it in London, England,
I said that shit.

192
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:15,186
I said it at the Apollo Theater,
I said that shit.

193
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,705
I don't believe a black woman
can be first lady.

194
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:22,990
You know why? Cos a black woman cannot
play the background of a relationship.

195
00:14:27,591 --> 00:14:31,027
Don't get me wrong - a black woman
could be president with no problem.

196
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:34,023
First lady? Too much shutting up in that job.

197
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:39,626
Can you imagine telling your black wife
that you president?

198
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:41,429
"Honey, I won. I'm president."

199
00:14:41,511 --> 00:14:42,785
"No! We president.

200
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:51,743
"And I want my girlfriends in the cabinet.

201
00:14:51,831 --> 00:14:55,062
"I want Kiki to be Secretary of Defense.

202
00:14:55,151 --> 00:14:57,426
"She can fight. She can fight."

203
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,828
No, no, you can't have
no black first lady.

204
00:15:03,911 --> 00:15:06,869
That's too much work
for the secret service.

205
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:10,744
"We can't let her through, sir.
We can't let her through."

206
00:15:10,831 --> 00:15:13,948
"It's my fucking wife, man.
She's gonna kill you!"

207
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:17,182
No, no, no.

208
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:20,741
That's right. Barack Obama
really want to be the president,

209
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,504
he got to get him a white girl.

210
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:25,980
Yeah, I said it.

211
00:15:26,071 --> 00:15:29,586
Why? Cos a white girl
will play her position.

212
00:15:29,671 --> 00:15:32,822
The black girl wanna play your position.

213
00:15:34,271 --> 00:15:36,865
You under the quarterback going, "Hike, hike!"

214
00:15:36,951 --> 00:15:39,419
She right next to you,
"Hike, hike!"

215
00:15:39,511 --> 00:15:41,069
"We can't both hike."

216
00:15:41,151 --> 00:15:42,903
"I don't give a fuck."

217
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:47,750
That's right. You get you a white girl,
she do exactly what you need her to do.

218
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:49,742
"I need you to run left, slant right."

219
00:15:49,831 --> 00:15:51,787
"OK, Daddy, I got ya."

220
00:15:59,911 --> 00:16:01,788
And you win.

221
00:16:01,871 --> 00:16:04,704
Whoo, black women get mad
when I say that shit, boy.

222
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:07,624
"Oh, you need a white girl?
You think you need a white girl?

223
00:16:07,711 --> 00:16:09,861
"Fuck you, motherfucker.

224
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:11,828
"You think you need a white girl?

225
00:16:11,911 --> 00:16:15,028
"As soon as you all get a little money,
you want a white girl.

226
00:16:15,111 --> 00:16:17,864
"Soon as you get a little money,
you want a white girl."

227
00:16:18,671 --> 00:16:20,627
"Actually, before we get money."

228
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:28,425
Oh!

229
00:16:29,551 --> 00:16:31,860
Oh, don't worry. I'm a bring it back.

230
00:16:33,551 --> 00:16:36,987
Black women get pissed off
at some interracial dating, boy.

231
00:16:37,071 --> 00:16:39,141
Black women get mad as a motherfucker.

232
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:42,223
Black women get angrier
than southern white men.

233
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:46,783
They get pissed the fuck off.

234
00:16:46,871 --> 00:16:50,625
Especially if they see, like,
a white girl with a famous black man.

235
00:16:50,711 --> 00:16:52,110
Ooh! They get fuckin' mad.

236
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:56,901
They see, like, a white girl with Denzel
Washington, they fucking start shaking.

237
00:16:56,991 --> 00:17:00,427
They ready to punch
that white girl in the face.

238
00:17:00,511 --> 00:17:03,264
"What the fuck you doing with Denzel?

239
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:08,381
"Trying to take our good black men.

240
00:17:08,471 --> 00:17:10,063
"We only got eight."

241
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:19,263
That's right.
Black women get mad.

242
00:17:19,351 --> 00:17:22,423
They get mad at us,
the black man. They get mad!

243
00:17:22,511 --> 00:17:26,345
They get mad at us
cos we like to exercise our variety.

244
00:17:26,431 --> 00:17:31,061
That's right, that's right.
Black men like to exercise their variety.

245
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:33,745
When the black man
is looking for a mate,

246
00:17:33,831 --> 00:17:36,584
we check out
the whole menu of women.

247
00:17:36,671 --> 00:17:39,139
We're like, "Uh, you got any specials?"

248
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:45,704
Sisters get mad. Sisters will get in your face,
like, "You don't like your mother."

249
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,941
They get all up in your grill.

250
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:51,103
That's right. But they act like
they mad at the black man.

251
00:17:51,191 --> 00:17:52,943
But no!
They're not mad at us.

252
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,226
They're mad at themselves.

253
00:17:55,311 --> 00:17:58,348
That's right, yeah. I said it, I said it.

254
00:17:58,431 --> 00:18:01,229
Yeah, I'm looking right at ya!

255
00:18:01,311 --> 00:18:04,109
I said it. You are mad at yourself.

256
00:18:04,191 --> 00:18:09,470
Cos I'm a tell you the real reason black
women get so mad at interracial dating.

257
00:18:09,551 --> 00:18:13,669
Oh, I'm a break it the fuck down tonight.

258
00:18:13,751 --> 00:18:17,539
The real reason black women get so mad
at interracial dating -

259
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:20,020
it ain't all black women,
but it's most black women -

260
00:18:20,111 --> 00:18:23,421
the real reason black women
get so angry

261
00:18:23,511 --> 00:18:26,389
at interracial dating is cos black women

262
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:28,666
are not attracted to white men.

263
00:18:36,311 --> 00:18:39,030
Don't get me wrong.
They'll fuck a pretty white boy.

264
00:18:39,111 --> 00:18:43,582
They'll fuck Matthew McConaughey
or George Clooney, Brad Pitt,

265
00:18:43,671 --> 00:18:46,390
they'll give Beckham some pussy, yes.

266
00:18:47,271 --> 00:18:51,867
But black men, our standards ain't that high.
We'll fuck any white girl.

267
00:18:58,351 --> 00:19:01,661
A matter of fact, the bigger, the better.

268
00:19:01,751 --> 00:19:04,140
It's just more white to love.

269
00:19:05,271 --> 00:19:11,221
There's white women in this room right now,
don't even have scales in their house.

270
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:15,384
They know they gaining weight when
too many black guys start hitting on 'em.

271
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:20,262
"It's like these black guys
are all over me.

272
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:21,784
"I gotta work out."

273
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:28,628
That's right. Black men
love a big white woman.

274
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:32,624
Shit, a black man will
drop-kick Keira Knightley

275
00:19:32,711 --> 00:19:34,986
to get to Rosie O'Donnell.

276
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:44,826
Boy, we will tear that Rosie pussy up, boy.

277
00:19:44,911 --> 00:19:49,780
Shit, move that gut to the side,
there's some good pussy under there.

278
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:55,390
We don't give a fuck!

279
00:19:55,471 --> 00:19:58,668
We'll fuck the whole View,

280
00:19:58,751 --> 00:20:00,230
Rosie, Barbara Walters,

281
00:20:00,311 --> 00:20:04,429
Joy Behar, it'd be "the view
from the back of that ass."

282
00:20:06,351 --> 00:20:09,548
Shit, we'll fuck Rachael Ray,
right after that shit.

283
00:20:09,631 --> 00:20:12,748
Fucking Rachael Ray
with her plump ass and shit.

284
00:20:12,831 --> 00:20:16,187
I'll fuck her right in
the arm fat, right here.

285
00:20:16,271 --> 00:20:19,024
Right in this motherfucker.

286
00:20:19,111 --> 00:20:22,786
Right in this motherfucker.
"Whose arm is this?"

287
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:28,347
Just need a crease.
That's all a nigger needs is a crease.

288
00:20:28,431 --> 00:20:30,820
Just a crease, nigger.
That's a crease.

289
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:37,383
I'll fuck her in the arm fat and have her make
me some biscuits when that shit's all over.

290
00:20:39,231 --> 00:20:43,986
That's right, man. That's right.
And that's what makes black women so mad.

291
00:20:44,071 --> 00:20:46,027
Cos they know Rosie O'Donnell

292
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:50,502
could walk into any black club
in Harlem tonight

293
00:20:50,591 --> 00:20:52,582
and get her a black man.

294
00:20:52,671 --> 00:20:55,026
She don't even like men...

295
00:20:56,671 --> 00:21:00,380
but she can get her a black man.

296
00:21:00,471 --> 00:21:02,427
And it don't work
the other way around.

297
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:07,824
There ain't a bunch of black women out there
trying to fuck George from Seinfeld.

298
00:21:08,911 --> 00:21:13,382
That's right. You see a black woman
with an overweight white man,

299
00:21:13,471 --> 00:21:15,985
that means her credit is fucked up.

300
00:21:24,631 --> 00:21:27,623
Like, she's in financial straits.

301
00:21:27,711 --> 00:21:32,341
"Girl, what you doing with him?"
"They was gonna take my car."

302
00:21:37,511 --> 00:21:39,820
Yes, yes, yes, man.

303
00:21:40,511 --> 00:21:42,502
Yes, yes, yes, man.

304
00:21:42,591 --> 00:21:44,104
I don't know, man.

305
00:21:44,191 --> 00:21:46,625
Let's go back to the election
for a second, man.

306
00:21:47,151 --> 00:21:49,381
It don't matter who wins
this election right now.

307
00:21:49,471 --> 00:21:55,706
It don't matter Barack or McCain, it don't
matter right now cos Bush is still in charge.

308
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,827
George Bush is still in charge.

309
00:21:57,911 --> 00:22:01,540
And nobody gives less of a fuck
than George Bush.

310
00:22:03,591 --> 00:22:05,309
You think you don't give a fuck?

311
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:10,624
Bush don't give a fuck. Nobody gives
less of a fuck than George Bush.

312
00:22:10,711 --> 00:22:12,827
If you was hanging from a cliff,

313
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:15,550
getting ready to fall to your death,

314
00:22:15,631 --> 00:22:18,384
that's right, and Bush
was at the top of the cliff,

315
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:21,827
and all you needed was
a fuck to save your life,

316
00:22:21,911 --> 00:22:25,267
and Bush had a pocket full of fucks,

317
00:22:25,351 --> 00:22:27,501
he wouldn't give you one.

318
00:22:29,111 --> 00:22:31,022
"Bush, I need a fuck!"

319
00:22:31,111 --> 00:22:33,306
"Oh, you know I don't give a fuck.

320
00:22:42,311 --> 00:22:44,700
"Here's a fuck. Psych!"

321
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:50,620
Bush is unbelievable, man.
This guy's unbe-fucking-lievable.

322
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:54,021
Just the things that have gone down
since he's been the president...

323
00:22:54,111 --> 00:22:57,547
It's unprecedented how bad this guy is, OK?

324
00:22:57,631 --> 00:23:01,260
He ain't the worst president of the US,
he's the worst president of presidents.

325
00:23:01,351 --> 00:23:05,139
He's the worst PTA president,
president of the block association,

326
00:23:05,231 --> 00:23:07,665
president of major league baseball,

327
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:11,869
World Wide Wrestling Federation...
The worst president ever!

328
00:23:11,951 --> 00:23:13,543
This motherfucker.

329
00:23:13,631 --> 00:23:19,467
Just the shit that has gone down since
he's been president is unbelievable, man.

330
00:23:19,551 --> 00:23:23,829
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
The mortgage crisis going on right now,

331
00:23:23,911 --> 00:23:25,663
people losing their houses.

332
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:28,424
One month your mortgage is 900,

333
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:31,628
the next month it's 9,000.

334
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:34,828
You got to look outside
to see if you moved.

335
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:39,147
"Shit, this can't be the same neighbourhood."

336
00:23:39,231 --> 00:23:41,699
Fucking gas is through the roof.

337
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:44,305
Gas is so expensive right now,

338
00:23:44,391 --> 00:23:48,179
soon they're going to
start selling gas in bars.

339
00:23:48,271 --> 00:23:52,901
It's gonna be like, "I want to send half a
tank to the little lady over there in the red."

340
00:23:55,151 --> 00:23:59,110
I think pretty soon
people are gonna be fucking for gas.

341
00:24:02,271 --> 00:24:05,024
I think people are already fucking for gas.

342
00:24:06,671 --> 00:24:10,061
Some of y'all in here tonight
are fucking for gas.

343
00:24:11,671 --> 00:24:14,868
Like, "Girl, why you with him?"
"He filled up my tank."

344
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:23,744
Ladies, if a man fills up your tank,
you gotta fuck him.

345
00:24:23,831 --> 00:24:25,708
A quarter of a tank?
Handjob.

346
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:34,304
You gotta get to work, right?
You gotta get to work.

347
00:24:37,471 --> 00:24:40,269
Gas is so fucking expensive.
I don't even get it.

348
00:24:40,351 --> 00:24:42,421
So let me get this straight.

349
00:24:42,511 --> 00:24:45,787
We invade a country with oil...

350
00:24:45,871 --> 00:24:49,750
With oil, but gas costs more?

351
00:24:49,831 --> 00:24:52,026
That don't make no fucking sense.

352
00:24:52,111 --> 00:24:55,262
Now I didn't go to
no fancy school or nothing,

353
00:24:55,351 --> 00:24:57,546
but I tell you this right now,

354
00:24:57,631 --> 00:25:01,385
if I invade Kentucky Fried Chicken,

355
00:25:01,471 --> 00:25:04,747
wings will be cheap at my house.

356
00:25:09,511 --> 00:25:11,308
Yeah.

357
00:25:11,391 --> 00:25:14,064
Like, gas is so expensive now,

358
00:25:14,151 --> 00:25:16,540
whenever I fill up my tank,

359
00:25:16,631 --> 00:25:20,340
I just whip out my dick and jerk off
right at the gas station.

360
00:25:20,431 --> 00:25:22,387
That's what I do, if I fill it up,

361
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:24,223
I jerk it off.

362
00:25:24,311 --> 00:25:27,348
You know why? Cos when
I spend that type of money,

363
00:25:27,431 --> 00:25:28,944
I'm used to coming.

364
00:25:37,951 --> 00:25:39,907
You ought to try it.

365
00:25:39,991 --> 00:25:43,142
Next time you're running low,
you'll get happy.

366
00:25:43,231 --> 00:25:45,699
"Holy shit, I'm almost out of gas. Good!"

367
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:49,067
That's right, man.

368
00:25:49,151 --> 00:25:51,619
Shit, fucking gas is through the roof.

369
00:25:51,711 --> 00:25:54,020
This shit is no joke, man.

370
00:25:54,111 --> 00:25:57,069
And you know,
they're just trying to get you, man.

371
00:25:57,151 --> 00:26:00,427
And they keep saying,
"Is America ready for a black president?

372
00:26:00,511 --> 00:26:04,584
"Is America ready for a black..."
I hope Barack wins, man. I hope he wins.

373
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:06,946
I really do.

374
00:26:07,031 --> 00:26:09,067
I hope he wins.

375
00:26:10,231 --> 00:26:13,223
I hope he wins, just so as a black parent,

376
00:26:13,311 --> 00:26:17,224
I could stop giving that "You could do
whatever you want to, baby" speech.

377
00:26:17,311 --> 00:26:19,586
That my kids could
just go out and shit.

378
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:22,583
I don't have to say it
every time they walk out the house,

379
00:26:22,671 --> 00:26:26,425
"No matter what they say,
you could be whatever you want to be."

380
00:26:26,511 --> 00:26:29,309
Cos white parents
don't have to say that shit.

381
00:26:29,391 --> 00:26:31,507
Cos it's obvious, that's why.

382
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:35,709
You try to say that shit to a white kid,
they go, "Yeah, I know. I know.

383
00:26:35,791 --> 00:26:38,225
"I know, I can be anything.
I know, I know.

384
00:26:38,311 --> 00:26:41,144
"I know, if I work hard, I can be anything.
Yeah, I know.

385
00:26:41,231 --> 00:26:45,907
"You know what? Even if I don't
work hard, I can be anything."

386
00:26:47,631 --> 00:26:49,428
Tired of that shit, man.

387
00:26:49,511 --> 00:26:53,345
But they keep saying the same thing,
"Is America ready for a black president?

388
00:26:53,431 --> 00:26:56,821
"Is America ready for a black president?"
Well, we should be.

389
00:26:56,911 --> 00:26:59,379
We just had a retarded one.

390
00:27:02,591 --> 00:27:04,263
America, man. Crazy.

391
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:06,342
So much going on right now.

392
00:27:06,431 --> 00:27:10,822
And race is the big issue,
the biggest issue in the world right now.

393
00:27:10,911 --> 00:27:12,822
Race. It's a big thing, man.

394
00:27:12,911 --> 00:27:14,902
Racism all over the world.

395
00:27:14,991 --> 00:27:17,186
It will never die,
it will never die.

396
00:27:17,271 --> 00:27:19,466
It will only multiply, baby.

397
00:27:19,551 --> 00:27:23,146
Racism all over the world.
Even in my life, there's some racism.

398
00:27:23,231 --> 00:27:25,984
People go, "Really?"
Yeah, yeah. Yes, in my life.

399
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:30,189
I will give you an example of
how race affects my life, OK?

400
00:27:30,271 --> 00:27:34,264
I live in a place
called Alpine, New Jersey.

401
00:27:34,351 --> 00:27:39,061
I live in Alpine, New Jersey, right?
My house costs millions of dollars.

402
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:46,021
Don't hate the player,
hate the game.

403
00:27:52,431 --> 00:27:56,026
In my neighbourhood,
there are four black people.

404
00:27:56,111 --> 00:28:00,423
Hundreds of houses, four black people.
Who are these black people?

405
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:03,821
Well, there's me, Mary J Blige,

406
00:28:03,911 --> 00:28:07,381
Jay-Z and Eddie Murphy.

407
00:28:07,471 --> 00:28:10,986
Only black people
in the whole neighbourhood.

408
00:28:11,071 --> 00:28:15,064
So let's break it down.
Me, I'm a decent comedian, I'm all right.

409
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,028
Mary J Blige...

410
00:28:17,111 --> 00:28:21,184
Mary J Blige, one of the greatest
R&B singers to ever walk the earth,

411
00:28:21,271 --> 00:28:24,741
Jay-Z, one of the greatest
rappers to ever live,

412
00:28:24,831 --> 00:28:28,619
Eddie Murphy, one of the funniest actors
to ever, ever do it.

413
00:28:28,711 --> 00:28:32,909
Do you know what the white man that
lives next door to me does for a living?

414
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:35,107
He's a fucking dentist.

415
00:28:39,671 --> 00:28:42,822
He ain't the best dentist in the world.

416
00:28:43,671 --> 00:28:46,629
He ain't going to the dental hall of fame.

417
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:49,464
He don't get plaques for
getting rid of plaque.

418
00:28:50,351 --> 00:28:53,741
He's just a yank-your-tooth-out dentist.

419
00:28:53,831 --> 00:28:56,743
See, the black man gotta fly

420
00:28:56,831 --> 00:29:00,141
to get something that
the white man could walk to.

421
00:29:01,551 --> 00:29:03,382
That's right, baby.

422
00:29:03,471 --> 00:29:06,622
Shit, I had to make miracles happen
to get that house.

423
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:10,260
I had to host the Oscars to get that house.

424
00:29:11,511 --> 00:29:15,265
And to this day,
I don't even believe it's my house.

425
00:29:16,191 --> 00:29:19,263
That's why I keep a bag
packed right by the door...

426
00:29:23,391 --> 00:29:28,306
just in case the white people
that really own the place show up one day.

427
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,222
"Time to go, blackie."

428
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:32,950
"Damn, I knew this day would come.

429
00:29:33,031 --> 00:29:35,181
"Good thing I'm packed."

430
00:29:35,271 --> 00:29:40,789
Do you know what a black dentist would
have to do to move into my neighbourhood?

431
00:29:40,871 --> 00:29:42,623
He'd have to invent teeth.

432
00:29:47,311 --> 00:29:50,030
Racism, man. Racism out there, man.

433
00:29:50,111 --> 00:29:53,069
Only thing that makes me more angry
than racism,

434
00:29:53,151 --> 00:29:55,904
only one thing makes me more angry
than racism,

435
00:29:55,991 --> 00:29:59,620
is black people that are shocked at racism.

436
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:01,588
Cos whenever something racist goes down,

437
00:30:01,671 --> 00:30:05,380
they always manage to find
one black person that can't believe it.

438
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:10,226
"I can't believe Imus would say that."
I'm like, "Where the fuck you from?"

439
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:14,981
There's nothing a white person
could ever say to me

440
00:30:15,071 --> 00:30:17,187
that will ever catch me off guard.

441
00:30:17,271 --> 00:30:21,628
Ever. I'm always looking for some racism,
no matter where the fuck I'm at.

442
00:30:21,711 --> 00:30:24,623
I'm like, "Where the racism at?
Where it at? Where it at?"

443
00:30:24,711 --> 00:30:26,064
No matter where I'm at.

444
00:30:26,151 --> 00:30:28,824
I could be sitting down with Regis Philbin,

445
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:32,062
doing an interview,
talking about Madagascar 2.

446
00:30:32,151 --> 00:30:35,188
Say, "Yeah, Regis,
Madagascar 2 is real good, man.

447
00:30:35,271 --> 00:30:38,024
"I play a zebra again.
This motherfucker's great."

448
00:30:38,111 --> 00:30:42,309
And in the middle of the interview,
Regis will pull a pencil out of his pocket,

449
00:30:42,391 --> 00:30:45,110
stab me in the neck, say,
"Take that, you fucking nigger!

450
00:30:45,191 --> 00:30:47,068
"Take that you dirty, greasy nigger!

451
00:30:47,151 --> 00:30:49,107
"Take that,
you fucking nigger!"

452
00:30:49,191 --> 00:30:51,659
And I'll be like,
"I should have seen it coming.

453
00:30:54,991 --> 00:30:57,459
"I let Regis get too close."

454
00:30:57,551 --> 00:30:59,621
I'll be mad at me. I'll apologise.

455
00:30:59,711 --> 00:31:02,623
"Hey, man, I left my neck all out, man.

456
00:31:02,711 --> 00:31:05,225
"I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry."

457
00:31:05,311 --> 00:31:09,429
Yeah, man. Race, man. Big, man.
We live in a crazy time, man.

458
00:31:09,511 --> 00:31:11,183
We live in an insane time, man.

459
00:31:11,271 --> 00:31:15,742
We live in a time where
if you say the wrong thing, you in trouble.

460
00:31:15,831 --> 00:31:18,743
This is the first time in
the history of the world

461
00:31:18,831 --> 00:31:21,948
where white men actually have to watch
what they say.

462
00:31:22,031 --> 00:31:25,341
White men are getting in trouble
for saying the wrong words.

463
00:31:25,431 --> 00:31:27,262
That's unbelievable, man.

464
00:31:27,351 --> 00:31:29,785
And a lot of white guys,
"Hey, that's not fair.

465
00:31:29,871 --> 00:31:32,908
"You can say whatever you want.
You can say nigger."

466
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:38,145
Yeah, when I last checked, that was
the only advantage I had to being black.

467
00:31:40,351 --> 00:31:42,626
You want to switch places?

468
00:31:42,711 --> 00:31:45,942
You scream "nigger"
and I'll raise interest rates.

469
00:31:53,191 --> 00:31:55,944
Yeah, this is the first time
in the history of the world

470
00:31:56,031 --> 00:31:59,387
where white men have to watch their tongue.

471
00:31:59,471 --> 00:32:01,621
And now, white guys, don't worry about it.

472
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,667
You know, that's how life works, man.

473
00:32:03,751 --> 00:32:05,469
That's how life works.

474
00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:09,510
Sometimes the people with
the most shit have to shut up

475
00:32:09,591 --> 00:32:12,185
and let other people talk shit about 'em.

476
00:32:12,271 --> 00:32:14,501
That's how life works. That's right.

477
00:32:14,591 --> 00:32:17,822
Sometimes the people with the most shit
get to say the least shit.

478
00:32:17,911 --> 00:32:20,823
And the people with the least shit
get to say the most shit.

479
00:32:20,911 --> 00:32:25,587
So if you want to say the most shit,
get rid of some of your shit.

480
00:32:25,671 --> 00:32:27,741
That's how the world works, man.

481
00:32:27,831 --> 00:32:32,063
Some people get to talk about other people,
and that's just how it goes, man.

482
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:36,906
For instance, like, fat girls can say
whatever they want to about skinny girls.

483
00:32:36,991 --> 00:32:40,586
Fat girls can talk about
skinny girls all day long,

484
00:32:40,671 --> 00:32:45,222
"Fucking skinny bitch,
fucking skinny-ass anorexic,

485
00:32:45,311 --> 00:32:48,747
"bulimic, fucking regurgitating bitch.

486
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:54,428
"Fucking Cheerio-belt-wearing bitch,
salad-eating motherfucker.

487
00:32:54,511 --> 00:32:56,979
"Hope she chokes on a crouton."

488
00:32:59,031 --> 00:33:02,740
But skinny girls can't talk about fat girls.

489
00:33:02,831 --> 00:33:04,787
That's just mean.

490
00:33:05,671 --> 00:33:08,026
"Look at these big bitches.

491
00:33:10,711 --> 00:33:13,020
"Do they freebase gravy?

492
00:33:17,311 --> 00:33:20,064
"Food is not your friend.
It's not your friend."

493
00:33:21,511 --> 00:33:23,820
For instance, you know...

494
00:33:26,391 --> 00:33:30,543
Short guys can talk about
tall guys all day long.

495
00:33:30,631 --> 00:33:35,227
Short guys can say whatever they want to
about tall guys, "You tall bastard.

496
00:33:35,311 --> 00:33:37,871
"You tall motherfucker.

497
00:33:37,951 --> 00:33:41,864
"I hope your head hits an air-conditioning vent.

498
00:33:41,951 --> 00:33:45,261
"I hope Bin Laden flies a plane into your lips."

499
00:33:50,031 --> 00:33:52,943
But tall guys can't talk about short guys.

500
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,226
That's just mean.

501
00:33:55,311 --> 00:33:58,826
"Look at these
midget motherfuckers.

502
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,027
"Fee fie foe fum!"

503
00:34:08,351 --> 00:34:12,947
Like poor people can talk about rich people
all day long.

504
00:34:13,031 --> 00:34:17,786
Poor people can say whatever they want to
about rich people, "You fucking rich bastard.

505
00:34:17,871 --> 00:34:20,829
"I hope your yacht hits an iceberg
in the summer.

506
00:34:24,351 --> 00:34:28,629
"Fucking ice... I hope your Picasso
falls off the wall and kills your mother.

507
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,545
"You fucking rich bastard."

508
00:34:33,631 --> 00:34:36,623
But rich people can't talk about poor people.

509
00:34:36,711 --> 00:34:38,781
That's just mean.

510
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:41,101
It's like, "Look at these broke bastards.

511
00:34:42,911 --> 00:34:47,348
"Perhaps we should raise the prices
so we don't have to see these people again.

512
00:34:50,071 --> 00:34:52,027
"Is that a Hyundai?

513
00:34:53,071 --> 00:34:55,539
"With cloth interior. Ooh!"

514
00:34:56,431 --> 00:34:59,309
Yes, man. That's right.
You gotta watch what you say.

515
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:03,430
Even some black people have to watch
what they say. Even some black people.

516
00:35:03,511 --> 00:35:05,820
What's my man on Grey's Anatomy?

517
00:35:05,911 --> 00:35:07,867
Got fired.

518
00:35:08,911 --> 00:35:11,345
Got fired for calling somebody a faggot.

519
00:35:11,431 --> 00:35:14,787
Yeah, we live in a crazy time.
You gotta watch what you say, baby.

520
00:35:14,871 --> 00:35:18,546
Between the internet and all these shows,
say the wrong thing, your career is over.

521
00:35:18,631 --> 00:35:22,590
But here's the crazy thing, man,
it's not about the words sometimes, man.

522
00:35:22,671 --> 00:35:25,822
It ain't about the words,
all bad words ain't bad.

523
00:35:25,911 --> 00:35:29,984
Sometimes it's about the context
in which the word is said.

524
00:35:30,071 --> 00:35:31,550
It's not always the word,

525
00:35:31,631 --> 00:35:35,783
it's the context in which the word is said.

526
00:35:35,871 --> 00:35:38,624
You know, depending on
what you're talking about,

527
00:35:38,711 --> 00:35:41,544
you say, "You the finest bitch I ever seen."

528
00:35:41,631 --> 00:35:43,587
That's a compliment.

529
00:35:44,871 --> 00:35:49,069
It ain't the word! It's the context in which
the word is being said.

530
00:35:49,151 --> 00:35:52,905
So my man on Grey's Anatomy,
it ain't that he called somebody a faggot,

531
00:35:52,991 --> 00:35:55,664
it's like, how did he say "faggot"?

532
00:35:55,751 --> 00:36:01,781
How did he say it? Did he come in
early one day and go, "Morning, faggot"?

533
00:36:01,871 --> 00:36:04,704
Cos if he did that, he should be fired.

534
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:07,225
But how did he say it?

535
00:36:07,311 --> 00:36:10,621
Was he having a fight with this person?
Was he having an argument?

536
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:14,226
Do they have a relationship of some sort?
How did he say it?

537
00:36:14,311 --> 00:36:17,144
And here's the other thing,
if they was having a fight,

538
00:36:17,231 --> 00:36:20,746
well, I just think personally,
if you having a fight with somebody,

539
00:36:20,831 --> 00:36:25,951
you should be able to say whatever you think
is gonna hurt this person the most.

540
00:36:26,031 --> 00:36:30,627
What, I gotta be politically correct
and mad at the same time?

541
00:36:30,711 --> 00:36:34,420
Like if I'm driving
and somebody crashes into me,

542
00:36:34,511 --> 00:36:35,864
and they got one leg,

543
00:36:35,951 --> 00:36:38,226
I'm a talk about the leg.

544
00:36:43,391 --> 00:36:48,749
"Hey, you one-legged bastard,
no wonder you can't brake.

545
00:36:50,231 --> 00:36:52,870
"I hope you got
some two-legged insurance."

546
00:36:55,711 --> 00:36:58,748
But how did he say "faggot"?

547
00:36:58,831 --> 00:37:01,584
Now here's the real question
nobody wants to ask.

548
00:37:01,671 --> 00:37:05,664
What if the person that he called a faggot...

549
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,825
was acting like a faggot?

550
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:15,981
I'm not trying to disrespect any gay people.
I have gay friends. I know I have gay fans.

551
00:37:16,071 --> 00:37:20,667
I know some of y'all are here tonight.
I just want to say... thanks for the money.

552
00:37:23,311 --> 00:37:29,227
I'm all for gay rights. I hope you get the
right to get married and buy cereal and...

553
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:32,542
whatever you being denied,
I hope you get it

554
00:37:32,631 --> 00:37:36,544
cos I think gay fans
are some of the best fans to have

555
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:39,543
cos they can buy tickets faster than anybody.

556
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:44,227
You know why? Cos they don't have
any fucking kids, that's why.

557
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:46,779
You never see no gay homeless people.

558
00:37:50,271 --> 00:37:54,059
There's no gay homeless people
and there's no Asian homeless people.

559
00:37:54,151 --> 00:37:57,063
That's just the homeless rules.

560
00:37:57,151 --> 00:37:59,790
The homeless discriminate. Yes, they do.

561
00:37:59,871 --> 00:38:02,465
You'd think they would be more understanding.

562
00:38:02,551 --> 00:38:03,700
But where was I?

563
00:38:03,791 --> 00:38:10,867
What if the person that he called
a faggot was acting like a faggot?

564
00:38:10,951 --> 00:38:14,546
Cos you don't have to be gay
to act like a faggot.

565
00:38:14,631 --> 00:38:17,668
You don't even have to
be a man to act like a faggot.

566
00:38:17,751 --> 00:38:20,219
Anybody can act like a faggot.

567
00:38:20,311 --> 00:38:22,302
Let me give you an example.

568
00:38:23,351 --> 00:38:25,785
I love Gwen Stefani.

569
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:30,023
I think No Doubt is one of
the best groups in the world.

570
00:38:30,111 --> 00:38:33,023
I keep a No Doubt CD in my car.

571
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:35,420
And I sing that shit to the end, I'm like...

572
00:38:42,511 --> 00:38:44,786
I won't even get out my car
until the shit's over. I'm like...

573
00:38:56,271 --> 00:38:59,661
I fucking love me some Gwen Stefani, right?

574
00:38:59,751 --> 00:39:02,663
Now if I'm driving my car
and I'm at the light,

575
00:39:02,751 --> 00:39:06,585
and you're in the car behind me,
and the light's red,

576
00:39:06,671 --> 00:39:09,310
and I'm blasting some Gwen Stefani
and I'm like...

577
00:39:15,671 --> 00:39:18,822
And you're in the car behind me
and the light's red, cool.

578
00:39:18,911 --> 00:39:21,061
But then the light turns green.

579
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:23,711
And I don't see it
cos I'm in Gwen Stefani heaven.

580
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:26,624
And I'm just goin'...

581
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:33,424
Now the light starts fucking blinking.

582
00:39:33,511 --> 00:39:35,900
It's getting ready to turn red again!

583
00:39:35,991 --> 00:39:39,427
And I still don't see it!
And I'm in my car going...

584
00:39:48,191 --> 00:39:53,424
Now if you're in the car behind me
and that light's getting ready to turn red,

585
00:39:53,511 --> 00:39:56,025
and I'm going...

586
00:39:58,271 --> 00:39:59,829
If you're in that car behind me,

587
00:39:59,911 --> 00:40:03,904
you have the right to go,
"Hey, faggot, the light's about to change!"

588
00:40:18,111 --> 00:40:21,501
Shit, even Elton John
would call me a faggot...

589
00:40:23,071 --> 00:40:24,982
at that moment.

590
00:40:27,431 --> 00:40:29,023
It's not the word,

591
00:40:29,111 --> 00:40:33,184
it's the context in which
the word is being said.

592
00:40:33,271 --> 00:40:36,661
That's what's going on.
It ain't the word, it's the context.

593
00:40:36,751 --> 00:40:41,029
Now, speaking of words, now they're trying
to get rid of the word "nigger".

594
00:40:41,111 --> 00:40:43,705
Trying to get rid of my beloved "nigger".

595
00:40:45,431 --> 00:40:51,870
Shit. Last year, the NAACP
had a funeral for the word "nigger".

596
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:53,589
Well, tonight is Easter.

597
00:41:03,911 --> 00:41:05,424
Shit.

598
00:41:05,511 --> 00:41:09,629
That's right. Whenever
the word "nigger" is spoken,

599
00:41:09,711 --> 00:41:15,308
it is always followed by the same question -
"Can white people say nigger?"

600
00:41:15,391 --> 00:41:17,347
And the correct answer is...

601
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:19,547
not really.

602
00:41:20,991 --> 00:41:23,903
You have to check
with your nigger consulate,

603
00:41:23,991 --> 00:41:26,869
talk to your nigger representative,

604
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:31,866
and they will tell you the nigger rules
where you are at that particular time.

605
00:41:31,951 --> 00:41:36,786
We live in a crazy time where Dr King
and Mr Mandela's dreams are coming true.

606
00:41:36,871 --> 00:41:41,342
Black and white people and Asians, Indians,
and everybody's hanging out together.

607
00:41:41,431 --> 00:41:44,901
Interracial posses.
It's unbelievable what's going on, man.

608
00:41:44,991 --> 00:41:46,743
Unbelievable.

609
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:50,066
Unbelievable. It's unbelieva...

610
00:41:50,151 --> 00:41:53,746
All my black friends
have a bunch of white friends.

611
00:41:53,831 --> 00:41:57,062
And all my white friends
have one black friend.

612
00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:08,061
Yeah, man.

613
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:12,463
But if you are in an interracial posse,
you have to figure out,

614
00:42:12,551 --> 00:42:15,748
you know, what are the rules
of the interracial posse?

615
00:42:15,831 --> 00:42:19,426
What are the Dr Dre rules of your crew?

616
00:42:19,511 --> 00:42:22,708
That's right, cos, you know,
what are the Dr Dre rules?

617
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:28,548
What are the rules when a Dr Dre song
comes on the radio or plays at a club?

618
00:42:28,631 --> 00:42:31,429
What is the procedure that goes into effect?

619
00:42:31,511 --> 00:42:36,983
Cos sometimes I'm with my white friends
and a Dr Dre song will come on.

620
00:42:37,071 --> 00:42:40,222
And there's a lot of "niggers" in a Dr Dre song.

621
00:42:40,311 --> 00:42:41,903
And they want to enjoy it,

622
00:42:41,991 --> 00:42:45,301
but they can't really enjoy it around me.

623
00:42:46,711 --> 00:42:50,624
So they start taking out the "niggers"
or mumbling the "niggers".

624
00:42:50,711 --> 00:42:53,464
And that's just a sad sight to see.

625
00:42:53,551 --> 00:42:56,827
It's just sad to see some white person

626
00:42:56,911 --> 00:43:01,826
trying to do a niggerless rendition
of a Dr Dre song.

627
00:43:01,911 --> 00:43:04,220
It's just fucking depressing.

628
00:43:04,311 --> 00:43:07,747
They're trying to rap along
without saying "nigger" and they're like...

629
00:43:11,471 --> 00:43:14,463
I don't know what the fuck to say.

630
00:43:22,551 --> 00:43:24,940
But I know when I'm not there,

631
00:43:25,031 --> 00:43:27,545
shit, they lean into that shit.

632
00:43:29,831 --> 00:43:32,550
"He's not here. Turn it up!"

633
00:43:33,591 --> 00:43:35,980
They're like...

634
00:43:51,951 --> 00:43:53,703
...On his back!

635
00:43:53,791 --> 00:43:55,383
And kill him!

636
00:43:55,471 --> 00:43:57,541
I hate niggers!

637
00:43:57,631 --> 00:44:00,429
"Say, hey, man, that's not even in the song."

638
00:44:01,751 --> 00:44:04,424
"I got a little carried away.
Sorry about that.

639
00:44:04,511 --> 00:44:07,184
"They should put it in.
They really should."

640
00:44:10,071 --> 00:44:12,824
Don't worry, white people, get your Dre on.

641
00:44:12,911 --> 00:44:16,187
Get your Dre on, get your J on,
get your Kanye on.

642
00:44:16,271 --> 00:44:21,299
It's all right, it's all good. It's gotta be
in the song, though. It's gotta be in the song.

643
00:44:21,391 --> 00:44:23,382
It's got to be in the song.

644
00:44:23,471 --> 00:44:27,828
So the question remains the same,
can white people say "nigger"?

645
00:44:27,911 --> 00:44:29,469
And the answer is the same.

646
00:44:29,551 --> 00:44:31,428
Not really.

647
00:44:32,071 --> 00:44:35,188
There's some exceptions,
like, "Fuck me harder, nigger."

648
00:44:42,391 --> 00:44:46,669
A lot of white women trying not to laugh
in front of their husbands right now.

649
00:44:49,911 --> 00:44:52,425
"Honey, I was in college.

650
00:44:53,511 --> 00:44:55,627
"I had to see what it was about.

651
00:44:55,711 --> 00:44:57,667
"He made me say it."

652
00:45:01,951 --> 00:45:07,662
But the question remains the same,
can white people say "nigger"?

653
00:45:07,751 --> 00:45:11,027
And the answer's the same - not really.

654
00:45:11,111 --> 00:45:14,626
But wait a minute. There's one exception.

655
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:16,588
There's one exception.

656
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:21,426
There's one instance where
white people can say "nigger".

657
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:23,581
And I'm a let it out tonight.

658
00:45:23,671 --> 00:45:26,663
I'm a let it out here in Johannesburg.

659
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:33,103
The one time that white people
can say "nigger"...

660
00:45:33,191 --> 00:45:36,149
The white people are like,
"This is what I paid for.

661
00:45:41,631 --> 00:45:43,826
"It's a fucking great night now."

662
00:45:44,711 --> 00:45:48,147
The one time white people can say "nigger"...

663
00:45:48,231 --> 00:45:49,584
Here goes.

664
00:45:49,671 --> 00:45:54,222
Listen closely,
cos I may never say this shit again.

665
00:45:54,311 --> 00:45:56,825
The one time white people can say "nigger"...

666
00:45:56,911 --> 00:45:58,310
OK.

667
00:45:59,671 --> 00:46:01,787
If it's Christmas Eve

668
00:46:01,871 --> 00:46:04,226
and it's between 4:30

669
00:46:04,311 --> 00:46:08,224
and 4:49 in the morning,

670
00:46:08,311 --> 00:46:09,710
if you white,

671
00:46:09,791 --> 00:46:16,708
and you on your way to Toys R Us
to get your kid the last Transformer doll,

672
00:46:16,791 --> 00:46:20,022
and right before you walk into Toys R Us,

673
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:22,705
some black person runs up beside you,

674
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:27,262
smacks you in the head with a brick, knocks
you to the ground, stomps you in the face,

675
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:30,548
"Take that, you cracker-ass motherfucker,

676
00:46:30,631 --> 00:46:34,909
"take that, you cracker-ass motherfucker,
motherfucker. Take that."

677
00:46:34,991 --> 00:46:36,788
Riverdances on your head,

678
00:46:36,871 --> 00:46:40,864
"Take that, you cracker-ass motherfucker,
cracker-ass motherfucker,

679
00:46:40,951 --> 00:46:45,945
"take that, you cracker-ass motherfucker,"
Takes your money, pisses on you...

680
00:46:46,031 --> 00:46:48,420
and runs away.

681
00:46:48,511 --> 00:46:51,344
If you white, at that moment, you can say,

682
00:46:51,431 --> 00:46:54,628
"Somebody stop that nigger!"

683
00:47:06,911 --> 00:47:09,664
As a matter of fact,
if you white and that happens to you,

684
00:47:09,751 --> 00:47:11,662
you can say "nigger" for a whole month.

685
00:47:14,951 --> 00:47:19,069
But you got to walk around
with the police report in your pocket.

686
00:47:19,151 --> 00:47:22,143
In case any black people
catch you saying "nigger",

687
00:47:22,231 --> 00:47:26,668
the police report will act
as your freedom papers.

688
00:47:26,751 --> 00:47:29,982
"I heard you saying 'nigger'.
Let me see your fucking papers.

689
00:47:30,071 --> 00:47:32,346
"Give me the papers! Show me the papers!"

690
00:47:35,231 --> 00:47:37,187
"Christmas Eve.

691
00:47:40,551 --> 00:47:42,507
"4:48.

692
00:47:43,991 --> 00:47:46,346
"You just made it, motherfucker.

693
00:47:50,871 --> 00:47:52,543
"Pissed on you!

694
00:47:53,431 --> 00:47:55,467
"I hope they catch that nigger."

695
00:48:06,111 --> 00:48:07,988
Oh, man.

696
00:48:08,071 --> 00:48:11,347
Having a good time up here, man.
Good time up here.

697
00:48:11,871 --> 00:48:13,509
Apollo.

698
00:48:15,111 --> 00:48:16,464
Apollo!

699
00:48:17,591 --> 00:48:19,024
Up here working.

700
00:48:19,111 --> 00:48:21,671
Up here working.
I'm up here trying to do my thing.

701
00:48:21,751 --> 00:48:26,620
This ain't really work, though.
This is not really work. This is my career.

702
00:48:26,711 --> 00:48:29,384
It's not really a job, this is my career.

703
00:48:29,471 --> 00:48:33,669
You know, some people have jobs,
some people have careers.

704
00:48:33,751 --> 00:48:36,823
Some of y'all in the audience,
some of y'all got jobs,

705
00:48:36,911 --> 00:48:38,822
some of you have careers.

706
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:43,348
Now the people in the audience with careers
need to learn to shut the fuck up

707
00:48:43,431 --> 00:48:46,070
when you're around people with jobs.

708
00:48:47,431 --> 00:48:52,710
Cos they don't want to hear your career
bullshit. Keep that shit to yourself.

709
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:54,588
OK?

710
00:48:54,671 --> 00:48:58,107
Don't let your happiness make somebody sad.

711
00:48:58,191 --> 00:49:00,068
Cos that's what it does.

712
00:49:00,151 --> 00:49:02,984
No, no, man.
But I used to work. I used to have a job.

713
00:49:03,071 --> 00:49:05,141
I used to work at a Red Lobster,

714
00:49:05,231 --> 00:49:08,860
I used to work at Red Lobster
in Queens Boulevard.

715
00:49:08,951 --> 00:49:10,543
I was...

716
00:49:10,631 --> 00:49:13,191
Oh, I served you? Good, good.

717
00:49:13,271 --> 00:49:15,865
No, no, I was a dishwasher.

718
00:49:15,951 --> 00:49:19,864
I used to scrape shrimp in the garbage cans
then load up the dishwasher.

719
00:49:19,951 --> 00:49:21,179
And that was my real job.

720
00:49:21,271 --> 00:49:24,946
I never got a raise, I never got a
promotion. They kept me in the back.

721
00:49:25,031 --> 00:49:28,262
They kept me back there
cos I had really fucked-up teeth

722
00:49:28,351 --> 00:49:32,742
and they didn't want people to think
that shrimp fucked up your teeth.

723
00:49:32,831 --> 00:49:35,026
And that's what they do at restaurants,

724
00:49:35,111 --> 00:49:37,386
they put the ugliest people in the back.

725
00:49:37,471 --> 00:49:42,420
So if you don't like the people in the front,
you don't want to see the people in the back.

726
00:49:42,511 --> 00:49:44,979
And that was my real job.

727
00:49:45,071 --> 00:49:49,587
I wasn't working my way through school,
or in telling jokes, that was my life.

728
00:49:49,671 --> 00:49:52,868
1989, I was scraping shrimp.

729
00:49:52,951 --> 00:49:55,704
OK? And people go,
"Chris, how'd you end up like that?

730
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:58,510
"How the fuck did that happen to you?
Minimum-wage job?"

731
00:49:58,591 --> 00:50:04,541
I'll tell you exactly how that happened.
I dropped out of school in the 10th grade.

732
00:50:04,631 --> 00:50:09,830
Dropped out in the 10th grade, which is
the dumbest thing you could ever fucking do.

733
00:50:09,911 --> 00:50:13,062
You know why?
Cos when you drop out in the 10th grade,

734
00:50:13,151 --> 00:50:17,667
you really might as well have dropped out
in the second grade.

735
00:50:17,751 --> 00:50:22,506
Why? Cos you qualified
for the exact same jobs.

736
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:26,027
Matter of fact, the person that
dropped out in the second grade

737
00:50:26,111 --> 00:50:30,229
is more qualified cos they have
eight years of work experience.

738
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,623
Yeah, man.

739
00:50:35,711 --> 00:50:39,181
I used to scrape those fucking shrimp, man.
It used to kill me.

740
00:50:39,271 --> 00:50:43,105
But I'll tell you, now I have a career.
I've been blessed with a career.

741
00:50:43,191 --> 00:50:45,102
So if you've got a career, thank God.

742
00:50:45,191 --> 00:50:47,830
If you've got a job,
I hope you get a career one day.

743
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:52,268
That's right. Cos when you got a career,
there ain't enough time in the day.

744
00:50:52,351 --> 00:50:53,784
There ain't enough time!

745
00:50:53,871 --> 00:50:57,102
You got a career, you look at your watch,
time just flies like,

746
00:50:57,191 --> 00:51:00,581
"God damn, whoa. It's 5:35.

747
00:51:00,671 --> 00:51:04,664
"Damn, I gotta come in early
tomorrow and work on my project."

748
00:51:04,751 --> 00:51:07,663
Cos there ain't enough time
when you got a career.

749
00:51:07,751 --> 00:51:12,302
When you got a job, there's too much time.

750
00:51:12,391 --> 00:51:16,543
That's right. You look at your watch like,
"Aw, shit, 9:08."

751
00:51:18,591 --> 00:51:20,946
You don't even trust the time
when you got a job.

752
00:51:21,031 --> 00:51:23,465
You're like, "What time you got?
What time you got?

753
00:51:23,551 --> 00:51:25,906
"What time you got? What time you got?

754
00:51:25,991 --> 00:51:29,620
"9:15?" Whoever got the latest time
is the right time.

755
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:32,544
"He got the right time.
He got the right time."

756
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:36,021
You ever play the time game
with yourself at work?

757
00:51:36,111 --> 00:51:39,148
You ever play the time game where you go,

758
00:51:39,231 --> 00:51:43,588
"I'm not gonna look at
my watch for two hours.

759
00:51:44,391 --> 00:51:47,940
"That's right.
I'm a sit here and scrape these shrimp."

760
00:51:48,031 --> 00:51:50,067
Scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape

761
00:51:50,151 --> 00:51:54,349
scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape,
scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape.

762
00:51:54,431 --> 00:51:56,342
"OK, an hour's passed.

763
00:51:56,431 --> 00:51:58,342
"Maybe I should look...

764
00:51:59,351 --> 00:52:01,148
"and feel good.

765
00:52:01,231 --> 00:52:04,189
"No, fuck that. I'm a
wait a whole another hour."

766
00:52:04,271 --> 00:52:08,787
Scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape,
scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape,

767
00:52:08,871 --> 00:52:13,422
scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape,
scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape.

768
00:52:13,511 --> 00:52:15,786
"All right, two hours passed.

769
00:52:15,871 --> 00:52:18,943
"Time to look and feel good about myself."

770
00:52:19,031 --> 00:52:20,942
And you look.

771
00:52:21,031 --> 00:52:23,147
"Fuck! 15 minutes."

772
00:52:27,991 --> 00:52:29,709
You ever been so miserable at work

773
00:52:29,791 --> 00:52:33,340
that you spend extra time
just sitting on the toilet?

774
00:52:34,631 --> 00:52:38,783
You don't even have your pants down,
you're just like...

775
00:52:38,871 --> 00:52:41,465
"I hate this fucking job.

776
00:52:42,151 --> 00:52:43,948
"I hate it!"

777
00:52:44,031 --> 00:52:48,183
People around you taking smelly shits.

778
00:52:48,271 --> 00:52:51,627
That don't even faze you.
You're like, "I don't give a fuck.

779
00:52:51,711 --> 00:52:54,703
"You keep shittin' cos I ain't quitting."

780
00:52:59,671 --> 00:53:02,504
You know how you can tell
you got a real bad job?

781
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:05,469
When they give you
that half-hour lunch break.

782
00:53:05,551 --> 00:53:11,387
Whoo! There's nothing worse than
a half-hour lunch break to a grown person.

783
00:53:11,471 --> 00:53:15,669
"Why don't you just get a little spoon and
give me some apple sauce while you're at it?"

784
00:53:15,751 --> 00:53:18,026
A half-hour lunch break.

785
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:20,579
By the time you put on your jacket,

786
00:53:20,671 --> 00:53:23,708
walk around the corner,
go to the sandwich spot,

787
00:53:23,791 --> 00:53:26,259
order a sandwich,
wait for them to make it,

788
00:53:26,351 --> 00:53:30,663
then get in another line to pay for it,
28 minutes have passed.

789
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,628
Now you rushing back to work,

790
00:53:32,711 --> 00:53:35,828
you're eating your sandwich,
spilling beer down your shirt.

791
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:39,950
When you get in, your boss got the nerve
to go, "Hey, you're eight minutes late."

792
00:53:40,031 --> 00:53:41,783
"Fuck you!"

793
00:53:43,991 --> 00:53:48,746
Do you realise even criminals in jail
get an hour lunch break?

794
00:53:48,831 --> 00:53:51,743
Like, "Can I at least eat like a murderer?

795
00:53:52,831 --> 00:53:56,267
"I bet if I shot your ass,
I could finish this sandwich."

796
00:53:57,991 --> 00:53:59,947
But you gotta work.

797
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:01,699
Gotta work. We all gotta work.

798
00:54:01,791 --> 00:54:03,270
We all gotta work. Why?

799
00:54:03,351 --> 00:54:07,344
We spend money on things
we used to get for free.

800
00:54:07,431 --> 00:54:10,503
We spend money on things
we used to get for free like...

801
00:54:10,591 --> 00:54:12,468
water.

802
00:54:12,551 --> 00:54:15,384
You could still get free water,
but nobody does it.

803
00:54:15,471 --> 00:54:18,065
That's right,
we spend money on water,

804
00:54:18,151 --> 00:54:20,221
buying bottled fucking water.

805
00:54:20,311 --> 00:54:23,860
Do you know how many people
on earth right now are dying of thirst?

806
00:54:23,951 --> 00:54:29,150
How many people walk 10 and 20 miles
to get some fresh water?

807
00:54:29,231 --> 00:54:32,746
And we so fucking spoiled,
we buy bottled water.

808
00:54:32,831 --> 00:54:35,470
Do you know what it means
if you buy bottled water?

809
00:54:35,551 --> 00:54:39,021
That means you only use tap water
on your ass.

810
00:54:39,711 --> 00:54:43,067
And you wonder why people
want to blow us the fuck up.

811
00:54:43,151 --> 00:54:45,870
We got ass water, that's why.

812
00:54:45,951 --> 00:54:51,025
They dying of thirst, we be like,
"I gotta wash my ass. I gotta wash it."

813
00:54:55,671 --> 00:54:56,899
Fuck, man.

814
00:54:56,991 --> 00:54:58,902
You know why they call it tap water?

815
00:54:58,991 --> 00:55:01,949
Cos you just tap it on your nuts, that's why.

816
00:55:03,151 --> 00:55:08,384
Man. Bottled water, man. You know
the craziest thing we spend money on?

817
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:12,862
The craziest thing... We all done it.
You done it. I done it. We all done it.

818
00:55:12,951 --> 00:55:15,385
The craziest thing we spend money on...

819
00:55:15,471 --> 00:55:17,701
ringtones.

820
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:21,147
The phone used to ring for free.

821
00:55:22,231 --> 00:55:26,668
But "bring-bring" just wasn't good enough
for some of y'all.

822
00:55:26,751 --> 00:55:29,026
"I need a ring that expresses who I am.

823
00:55:29,111 --> 00:55:32,626
"I need to hear SexyBack
when my phone rings."

824
00:55:32,711 --> 00:55:34,827
And now they got us. Now they got us.

825
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:37,584
We gonna have ringtones
for the rest of our lives.

826
00:55:37,671 --> 00:55:39,707
People, "No, we're not." Oh yes, we are.

827
00:55:39,791 --> 00:55:41,827
I'll tell you exactly what's going to happen

828
00:55:41,911 --> 00:55:45,699
in this crazy George Bush deregulated world
we live in.

829
00:55:45,791 --> 00:55:47,463
Here's what's going to happen...

830
00:55:47,551 --> 00:55:51,988
The phone company is going to buy
the ringtone company

831
00:55:52,071 --> 00:55:57,543
and then they gonna start selling us phones
that don't fucking ring.

832
00:55:57,631 --> 00:56:00,145
They gonna make you buy a ringtone

833
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:03,860
or else you're gonna have to guess
when your phone is ringing.

834
00:56:08,551 --> 00:56:10,303
"Hello? Hello?

835
00:56:10,391 --> 00:56:13,986
"Hello? Hello?
I pick it up every four minutes just in case.

836
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:15,860
"Hello? Hello?

837
00:56:15,951 --> 00:56:18,545
"Damn, I need to buy SexyBack."

838
00:56:18,631 --> 00:56:21,020
But you gotta get your money right.

839
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:22,669
You got to get your money right.

840
00:56:22,751 --> 00:56:25,982
Men, you must get your money right.

841
00:56:26,071 --> 00:56:28,904
Men, you hear me?
You have to get your money right.

842
00:56:28,991 --> 00:56:31,221
It's important for men
to get their money right.

843
00:56:31,311 --> 00:56:36,590
Women, it's important for you to get your money
right, but not as important as it is for us.

844
00:56:36,671 --> 00:56:40,710
Why, women? Cos no one
will ever not fuck you cos you're broke.

845
00:56:44,551 --> 00:56:49,022
Your pussy will never be turned down
for financial reasons.

846
00:56:50,791 --> 00:56:52,702
It ain't gonna happen.

847
00:56:52,791 --> 00:56:56,864
That's right. Pussy's like Visa,
accepted everywhere.

848
00:57:01,791 --> 00:57:06,865
That's right. Next time you don't got no cash,
go, "Do you take pussy?"

849
00:57:06,951 --> 00:57:09,545
"Of course we take pussy.

850
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:11,906
"Who doesn't take pussy?

851
00:57:11,991 --> 00:57:14,141
"How much pussy you got?"

852
00:57:14,231 --> 00:57:15,550
Shit.

853
00:57:15,631 --> 00:57:19,624
Brother, I love being a man,
but I just wish I had a pussy.

854
00:57:19,711 --> 00:57:24,466
I really do. I wish I had a pussy
just for negotiation purposes.

855
00:57:25,591 --> 00:57:29,425
Just so when I'm negotiating a deal,
I could put that motherfucker on the table,

856
00:57:29,511 --> 00:57:31,820
"What about now?"

857
00:57:37,271 --> 00:57:39,182
"It's a deal."

858
00:57:41,151 --> 00:57:42,220
Yeah, man.

859
00:57:42,311 --> 00:57:44,586
It's hard being a man today.

860
00:57:44,671 --> 00:57:47,060
Hard being a man today.

861
00:57:47,151 --> 00:57:49,426
Why's it so hard to be a man?

862
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:51,388
Cos nobody cares about men.

863
00:57:51,471 --> 00:57:53,382
Nobody gives a fuck about men.

864
00:57:53,471 --> 00:57:56,463
You see a homeless man
on the street with a dog,

865
00:57:56,551 --> 00:57:59,019
you feel sorry for the dog.

866
00:57:59,831 --> 00:58:02,550
Say, "We got to get that dog some food."

867
00:58:04,751 --> 00:58:07,185
"What about the man?"
"Oh, fuck him."

868
00:58:08,231 --> 00:58:11,382
Say, every night on TV,
I see there's a new missing woman.

869
00:58:11,471 --> 00:58:13,905
"We gotta find Carole. Where's Carole?

870
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:17,381
"We must find Carole.
Carole didn't come home last night.

871
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,507
"Where the fuck is Carole?"

872
00:58:19,591 --> 00:58:23,345
I never seen one of these things
for a missing man yet.

873
00:58:24,031 --> 00:58:26,306
It's like, "Bob didn't come home last night."

874
00:58:26,391 --> 00:58:27,870
"Good.

875
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,906
"I hope he never comes home.

876
00:58:31,991 --> 00:58:34,824
"Probably out fucking Carole somewhere."

877
00:58:36,351 --> 00:58:38,740
That's right, hard being a man today.

878
00:58:38,831 --> 00:58:42,460
Why's it so hard being a man?
Cos you got to deal with today's woman.

879
00:58:42,551 --> 00:58:46,180
Today's woman. And today's woman
is a hard one to deal with, boy.

880
00:58:46,271 --> 00:58:50,230
What's the show all the women watch today?
Desperate Housewives.

881
00:58:50,311 --> 00:58:55,146
Desperate Housewives.
Bunch of women living in nice houses.

882
00:58:55,231 --> 00:58:57,142
Some of them don't even work.

883
00:58:57,231 --> 00:58:59,461
They all cheat on their husbands.

884
00:58:59,551 --> 00:59:03,146
They need to change the name of that show
from Desperate Housewives

885
00:59:03,231 --> 00:59:05,222
to Ungrateful Bitches.

886
00:59:13,631 --> 00:59:16,862
Every week, they fuck the pool boy,
the gardener,

887
00:59:16,951 --> 00:59:19,021
and he can fuck real good too.

888
00:59:19,111 --> 00:59:22,865
You know why? Cos he don't have
a full-time job, that's why.

889
00:59:22,951 --> 00:59:28,264
Shit, I could fuck that good too if I had
an extra eight hours to work on my stroke.

890
00:59:30,871 --> 00:59:35,422
You know what? I'm not even that good in
bed. I don't give a fuck. My bills are paid.

891
00:59:35,511 --> 00:59:39,470
"You better let this security
make your titties tingle."

892
00:59:42,511 --> 00:59:46,948
Shit. I have never knocked out
the pussy in my life.

893
00:59:47,031 --> 00:59:49,750
I've never knocked out the pussy in my life.

894
00:59:49,831 --> 00:59:52,345
I've won by decision.

895
00:59:54,431 --> 00:59:58,504
That's right. Two out of every five times
I fuck you is good.

896
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:01,663
Two out of five.
Them other three are horrible.

897
01:00:01,751 --> 01:00:04,709
But just when you're ready to pack your shit,

898
01:00:04,791 --> 01:00:06,747
I give you a good one.

899
01:00:09,551 --> 01:00:13,066
"Where'd that come from?"
"Viagra."

900
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:15,790
That's right, man. What do women want?

901
01:00:15,871 --> 01:00:17,827
What the fuck do women want?

902
01:00:17,911 --> 01:00:20,584
Everything. Everything.

903
01:00:20,671 --> 01:00:22,343
Everything.

904
01:00:22,431 --> 01:00:24,740
All around the world,
it's the same answer -

905
01:00:24,831 --> 01:00:27,868
everything, everything, everything.

906
01:00:27,951 --> 01:00:31,864
That's right, man.
Only women could get away with that answer.

907
01:00:31,951 --> 01:00:34,306
Nobody else is allowed to say "everything".

908
01:00:34,391 --> 01:00:37,144
When a man wants something,
he goes, "Damn, I want that.

909
01:00:37,231 --> 01:00:42,464
"I want it bad. I got to figure out
what I got to do to get that."

910
01:00:42,551 --> 01:00:46,590
When a woman wants something, she goes,
"Damn, I want that. I want it bad.

911
01:00:46,671 --> 01:00:50,630
"I gotta figure out
who I could get to get me that."

912
01:00:52,991 --> 01:00:55,551
Big differences, man. Women want a lot, man.

913
01:00:55,631 --> 01:00:58,748
Women want you to get on one knee and go,

914
01:00:58,831 --> 01:01:01,629
"I love you more
than anything else in the world,

915
01:01:01,711 --> 01:01:04,987
"I think you're the most beautiful,
intelligent creature on earth,

916
01:01:05,071 --> 01:01:07,460
"and I wanna spend
the rest of my life with you."

917
01:01:07,551 --> 01:01:09,462
But we ain't saying that.

918
01:01:09,551 --> 01:01:14,147
We're not saying that
unless we really fucked up bad!

919
01:01:14,231 --> 01:01:16,825
We gonna keep that one in our back pocket.

920
01:01:16,911 --> 01:01:20,187
We're not gonna just break it out
on a Tuesday.

921
01:01:20,271 --> 01:01:22,831
Ladies, if you ever hear
a man talking that shit,

922
01:01:22,911 --> 01:01:25,220
he might have fucked your sister.

923
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:29,307
OK?

924
01:01:29,391 --> 01:01:33,748
Ladies, do you know what the most romantic
words a man could say to you?

925
01:01:33,831 --> 01:01:38,666
The most romantic words a man
will ever say to you are these words...

926
01:01:40,151 --> 01:01:42,107
"I ain't going nowhere."

927
01:01:43,671 --> 01:01:46,139
It don't get no more romantic than...

928
01:01:46,231 --> 01:01:47,869
"I ain't going nowhere."

929
01:01:47,951 --> 01:01:51,626
You know why? Cos when a man says,
"I ain't going nowhere,"

930
01:01:51,711 --> 01:01:53,622
what he's trying to tell you is,

931
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:57,181
"I've actually thought about going somewhere.

932
01:01:57,271 --> 01:02:00,308
"I talked to a lawyer. I looked at a place.

933
01:02:00,391 --> 01:02:04,066
"And I realised I'm gonna go through
this same shit with the next girl,

934
01:02:04,151 --> 01:02:07,507
"so why not just stay here
and be miserable with you?"

935
01:02:09,111 --> 01:02:11,545
"I ain't going nowhere."

936
01:02:11,631 --> 01:02:13,064
You in there.

937
01:02:13,151 --> 01:02:15,824
So much difference
between men and women, man.

938
01:02:15,911 --> 01:02:18,266
One of the biggest differences
between men and women,

939
01:02:18,351 --> 01:02:23,345
men are actually happy when women go out
with their girlfriends and have a good time.

940
01:02:23,431 --> 01:02:27,185
When you go out with your girlfriends
and have a good time, we're happy for you.

941
01:02:27,271 --> 01:02:30,502
You come home and go, "Me and my
girlfriends are gonna see Sex And The City."

942
01:02:30,591 --> 01:02:35,381
We're like, "Great!
Now I don't have to take you to see that shit."

943
01:02:44,751 --> 01:02:47,390
"Why don't you go see
Mamma Mia while you're at it?"

944
01:02:50,511 --> 01:02:55,141
And you go see it and you come back,
you're like, "Sex And The City was so good.

945
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:56,983
"You shoulda saw the wedding!

946
01:02:57,071 --> 01:03:00,063
"Carrie got married to Big.
I can't believe it!"

947
01:03:00,911 --> 01:03:02,867
And we're fucking happy for you.

948
01:03:02,951 --> 01:03:04,703
We're happy for you.

949
01:03:04,791 --> 01:03:07,100
But it don't work the other way around.

950
01:03:07,191 --> 01:03:10,661
Women never want us to have a good time.

951
01:03:10,751 --> 01:03:13,902
Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.

952
01:03:13,991 --> 01:03:18,109
Fellas, if your woman come home from work

953
01:03:18,191 --> 01:03:20,944
and you got a smile on your face

954
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:24,660
that she didn't put there,
she gets suspicious.

955
01:03:24,751 --> 01:03:26,548
"What the fuck you smiling about?

956
01:03:28,231 --> 01:03:32,019
"I ain't fucked you in three weeks.
What the fuck you smiling about?"

957
01:03:32,111 --> 01:03:37,344
That's right, fellas, when you go out with your
boys and your woman says, "How was it?"

958
01:03:37,431 --> 01:03:39,501
Just go, "It was all right."

959
01:03:39,591 --> 01:03:43,823
Cos if you go beyond "all right",
you gonna be in a fight.

960
01:03:43,911 --> 01:03:46,983
You can't be like, "Baby, it was unbelievable.

961
01:03:47,071 --> 01:03:48,948
"I had the best time of my life.

962
01:03:49,031 --> 01:03:51,499
"A-Rod hit a home run
in the bottom of the ninth.

963
01:03:51,591 --> 01:03:53,024
"I couldn't believe it!"

964
01:03:53,111 --> 01:03:55,022
Watch what happens the next day.

965
01:03:55,111 --> 01:03:58,501
You waitin' for your food. No fucking food.

966
01:03:59,671 --> 01:04:01,229
"Baby, what's up with the food?"

967
01:04:01,311 --> 01:04:04,144
"Why don't you tell
A-Rod to cook you some?

968
01:04:07,311 --> 01:04:09,745
"Your fuckin' boyfriend, A-Rod."

969
01:04:10,911 --> 01:04:12,867
Yeah, man, women want it all.

970
01:04:12,951 --> 01:04:16,068
So many fucking differences.

971
01:04:16,151 --> 01:04:18,745
A lot of dates tonight. A lot of dates.

972
01:04:18,831 --> 01:04:23,063
A lot of men took women out tonight
they haven't even fucked yet.

973
01:04:24,111 --> 01:04:26,579
Say, "I'm gonna take her to see Chris Rock.

974
01:04:26,671 --> 01:04:30,550
"I'm gonna close this deal
with some Chris Rock tickets."

975
01:04:36,071 --> 01:04:40,189
Yeah. Yeah. 10/ of that pussy is mine.

976
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:45,060
Save me a lick or something, OK?

977
01:04:49,431 --> 01:04:53,310
Every man in here
that's with a woman he hasn't fucked yet,

978
01:04:53,391 --> 01:04:55,985
is all thinking the same thing...

979
01:04:56,071 --> 01:04:58,346
"When do I whip it out?

980
01:04:59,711 --> 01:05:02,862
"Do I just shove her hand down there
when we kiss good night

981
01:05:02,951 --> 01:05:06,739
"and watch her move it
like she got cerebral palsy or some shit?

982
01:05:11,551 --> 01:05:14,668
"Do I put it on a tray like an appetiser?

983
01:05:16,071 --> 01:05:18,710
"Sprinkle some parsley around there?

984
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:21,146
"'Bone apptit! '

985
01:05:22,751 --> 01:05:24,343
"How should the lighting be?

986
01:05:24,431 --> 01:05:28,743
"Should I put some Vaseline
or some lotion on it?"

987
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:31,470
Can't just whip out an ashy dick, right?

988
01:05:36,031 --> 01:05:37,703
And then once you whip it out,

989
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:41,784
there's always the chance that
the woman goes, "Could you put that back?

990
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:46,262
"Could you put that?" Shit, you know
how hard it is to get a dick back in the pants?

991
01:05:46,351 --> 01:05:49,104
A fucking black dick? God damn!

992
01:05:49,191 --> 01:05:52,979
What the fuck?
Your dick is out there on a false alarm.

993
01:05:53,071 --> 01:05:56,950
Then your dick looks up at you like,
"What the fuck was you thinking?

994
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:00,590
"Got me out here for this bullshit."

995
01:06:01,951 --> 01:06:03,828
That never happens to women.

996
01:06:03,911 --> 01:06:07,870
Women never whip out a titty and hear,
"Hey, put that titty back.

997
01:06:10,711 --> 01:06:14,590
"If I'd known you was whipping out titties,
I wouldn't have come upstairs.

998
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:16,343
"Put the titty back.

999
01:06:16,431 --> 01:06:18,547
"Are we gonna watch this movie or what?"

1000
01:06:20,751 --> 01:06:25,029
The other fucked-up thing is, guys, once
we whip it out, we never know what we got.

1001
01:06:25,111 --> 01:06:26,942
We never know if it's big or not,

1002
01:06:27,031 --> 01:06:31,661
cos women lie to us about our dicks so much,
we don't know what the fuck we got.

1003
01:06:31,751 --> 01:06:35,141
Cos when a woman's in love,
your dick's huge.

1004
01:06:35,231 --> 01:06:39,190
And the more they hate you,
the smaller your fucking dick gets.

1005
01:06:39,271 --> 01:06:41,421
So you don't know what the fuck you got.

1006
01:06:41,511 --> 01:06:45,948
You all disillusioned. Your shit is bigger
and smaller. You don't know what you got.

1007
01:06:46,031 --> 01:06:50,866
You walking around with the big-dick walk
with the little dick and shit.

1008
01:06:54,351 --> 01:06:58,663
Walking like this...
when you should be walking like this...

1009
01:07:00,071 --> 01:07:03,347
We don't know what the fuck we got.
I don't know what I got.

1010
01:07:03,431 --> 01:07:06,867
I mean, I'm lucky.
I'm skinny, so I got a little backdrop.

1011
01:07:06,951 --> 01:07:10,739
And everything looks bigger
against a little backdrop.

1012
01:07:13,111 --> 01:07:16,865
Like if you wide,
it looks like your dick's at sea and shit.

1013
01:07:16,951 --> 01:07:19,226
I don't know what the fuck I got.

1014
01:07:19,311 --> 01:07:22,428
But you know how you can tell
if a woman think you got a big dick?

1015
01:07:22,511 --> 01:07:25,548
You know how you can tell if a woman
think you got a big dick?

1016
01:07:25,631 --> 01:07:29,146
After you whip it out,
she just starts looking at it.

1017
01:07:30,271 --> 01:07:33,069
And then she says under her breath,

1018
01:07:33,151 --> 01:07:34,664
"Hello."

1019
01:07:42,271 --> 01:07:47,709
That's the universal big-dick greeting.
Like, "Hey, hey, welcome to Pussonia.

1020
01:07:47,791 --> 01:07:50,430
"We got a lot of work for you."

1021
01:07:53,071 --> 01:07:57,144
Men and women, so many fucking...

1022
01:07:57,231 --> 01:08:01,304
differences between men and women, man.
So many fucking differences.

1023
01:08:01,391 --> 01:08:06,146
The biggest difference between men
and women, one of the biggest differences,

1024
01:08:06,231 --> 01:08:09,701
men cannot go backwards sexually.

1025
01:08:09,791 --> 01:08:12,863
Women cannot go backwards in lifestyle.

1026
01:08:12,951 --> 01:08:15,021
Can't fucking do it.

1027
01:08:15,111 --> 01:08:19,502
Women cannot go backwards in lifestyle.
They can't do it. That's right.

1028
01:08:19,591 --> 01:08:21,547
They can't do it.

1029
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:24,703
I don't care...
The best woman can't fucking do it.

1030
01:08:24,791 --> 01:08:27,066
Can't fucking do it.

1031
01:08:27,151 --> 01:08:28,743
They can't do it, can't do it.

1032
01:08:28,831 --> 01:08:32,107
Fellas, you ever gone through
some hard times with your woman?

1033
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:33,829
You lose your job or something?

1034
01:08:33,911 --> 01:08:38,621
Your woman tries to console you, "Hey, baby,
don't worry. We gonna get through this.

1035
01:08:38,711 --> 01:08:43,341
"I know we got bills, but if we gotta get rid of
some shit, we will get rid of some of this shit."

1036
01:08:43,431 --> 01:08:45,991
She's talking about you.

1037
01:08:52,471 --> 01:08:53,984
Can't do it.

1038
01:08:54,071 --> 01:08:56,631
Fellas, if you lose your job,

1039
01:08:56,711 --> 01:08:58,622
you gonna lose your woman.

1040
01:08:58,711 --> 01:09:03,421
That's right. She may not leave the day
you lose it, but the countdown has begun.

1041
01:09:07,911 --> 01:09:09,105
Women can't do it.

1042
01:09:09,191 --> 01:09:14,219
Ladies, remember the first time
you ever dated a guy with his own car?

1043
01:09:14,311 --> 01:09:18,782
Remember that shit? You was leaving the club,
your girlfriends got on the bus,

1044
01:09:18,871 --> 01:09:21,021
you were like, "Bye, bitches.

1045
01:09:21,111 --> 01:09:23,386
"I'll see y'all later.

1046
01:09:23,471 --> 01:09:25,621
"I'm getting in this warm-ass car."

1047
01:09:25,711 --> 01:09:28,862
And from that moment on, you were like,
"You better have a car.

1048
01:09:28,951 --> 01:09:31,226
"You ain't getting this pussy without a car.

1049
01:09:31,311 --> 01:09:34,383
"I am not getting on the fucking bus
in February. Fuck that."

1050
01:09:34,471 --> 01:09:37,349
And that's how the fuck you roll
for the rest of your life.

1051
01:09:37,431 --> 01:09:42,425
Ladies, remember the first time you
ever dated a guy with his own apartment?

1052
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:45,309
You got in there, you were comfortable,
you were like,

1053
01:09:45,391 --> 01:09:48,542
"I could really enjoy getting fucked in here.

1054
01:09:48,631 --> 01:09:52,943
"I can scream and holler and break shit,

1055
01:09:53,031 --> 01:09:54,783
"yell instructions.

1056
01:09:54,871 --> 01:09:58,420
"I will never fuck in
nobody's mama's house again."

1057
01:09:58,511 --> 01:10:00,103
And you never did.

1058
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:02,466
You never fucking did.

1059
01:10:02,551 --> 01:10:07,261
Ladies, remember the first time
you ever had a man take you on vacation?

1060
01:10:07,351 --> 01:10:10,024
Say, "Whoo! This is great."

1061
01:10:10,111 --> 01:10:14,024
And from that moment on, every man
you dated had to take you somewhere.

1062
01:10:14,111 --> 01:10:18,104
You let 'em know as soon as you met 'em,
"Hey, this is passport pussy.

1063
01:10:23,831 --> 01:10:28,951
"If you think you can handle this pussy in one
time zone, you are out of your fucking mind."

1064
01:10:31,631 --> 01:10:33,826
And women love to tell you how much better

1065
01:10:33,911 --> 01:10:36,664
the pussy gonna get
when you get to the destination.

1066
01:10:36,751 --> 01:10:40,266
"You ain't got nothing yet.
Wait till we get to Jamaica."

1067
01:10:40,351 --> 01:10:44,390
You get to Jamaica, it's the same pussy
you had in Johannesburg,

1068
01:10:44,471 --> 01:10:46,223
in London, in Brooklyn.

1069
01:10:50,911 --> 01:10:53,983
Only difference is
now it's got a little bit of sand in it.

1070
01:10:57,351 --> 01:11:01,469
And the crazy thing, the crazy thing,
women love to tell you...

1071
01:11:01,551 --> 01:11:05,226
Women got their own money now.
Women have their own fucking money now.

1072
01:11:05,311 --> 01:11:07,267
And women are like, "Hey..."

1073
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:12,262
Women are like, "Hey,
if you don't take me on a nice vacation,

1074
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:15,900
"I'm a find me a cute guy
and I'm a pay for shit."

1075
01:11:15,991 --> 01:11:18,789
But that only lasts for like 30 days.

1076
01:11:18,871 --> 01:11:21,260
Cos women don't like paying for shit.

1077
01:11:21,351 --> 01:11:25,105
That's right - pussy costs money, dick is free.

1078
01:11:27,391 --> 01:11:30,542
Any money you spend on dick
is a bad investment.

1079
01:11:32,111 --> 01:11:35,820
Cos when it comes to women and money,
I'll tell you right now,

1080
01:11:35,911 --> 01:11:41,508
nothing dries up a pussy quicker
than a woman reaching for her wallet.

1081
01:11:41,591 --> 01:11:44,822
There is something about
a woman reaching for her wallet

1082
01:11:44,911 --> 01:11:47,789
that just dries up the vagina.

1083
01:11:47,871 --> 01:11:53,423
It's almost like the wallet
is sending a signal to the pussy

1084
01:11:53,511 --> 01:11:57,709
that this man is not
worthy of getting wet for.

1085
01:11:59,311 --> 01:12:01,745
And later on,
when you go to the gynaecologist,

1086
01:12:01,831 --> 01:12:05,346
he's like, "Oh, my God,
you've been paying for shit.

1087
01:12:09,831 --> 01:12:12,868
"Another $500, you gonna be in menopause."

1088
01:12:14,911 --> 01:12:18,586
Women cannot go backwards in lifestyle.

1089
01:12:18,671 --> 01:12:22,027
Men cannot go backwards sexually.

1090
01:12:22,111 --> 01:12:23,783
Can't do it.

1091
01:12:23,871 --> 01:12:28,422
Once we get the sex we like,
that's how the fuck we roll.

1092
01:12:29,351 --> 01:12:31,103
We get stubborn in our old age.

1093
01:12:31,191 --> 01:12:33,751
We're like, "I like my coffee like this,

1094
01:12:33,831 --> 01:12:37,346
"I like my steak like this
and I like to fuck like this.

1095
01:12:37,431 --> 01:12:41,060
"And if you ain't fucking like I'm
fucking, then get the fuck out."

1096
01:12:42,911 --> 01:12:44,583
Ladies, don't get mad at us.

1097
01:12:44,671 --> 01:12:48,789
Don't get mad at us.
Get mad at our ex-girlfriend.

1098
01:12:48,871 --> 01:12:51,260
She's the one that spoiled it for everybody.

1099
01:12:51,351 --> 01:12:55,139
The ex-girlfriend that did everything,
she fucked it up for everybody.

1100
01:12:55,231 --> 01:12:59,941
Call up one day, you're like,
"You did what? You licked his ass?

1101
01:13:01,031 --> 01:13:05,866
"Now he want everybody to lick his ass.
Thanks a lot, bitch."

1102
01:13:07,391 --> 01:13:13,341
That's right. Ladies, your man is nastier
than you ever imagined.

1103
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:18,903
Your man has been watching porno
since he was 12 years old.

1104
01:13:18,991 --> 01:13:21,869
He has pornographic images in his head

1105
01:13:21,951 --> 01:13:26,502
and he wants to relive some of this shit
before he drops dead.

1106
01:13:26,591 --> 01:13:29,708
That's right, ladies.
Get up on it. Get up on it.

1107
01:13:29,791 --> 01:13:32,544
Listen to what the fuck I'm about to say, OK?

1108
01:13:32,631 --> 01:13:37,068
Just because he came
don't mean you made him come.

1109
01:13:44,151 --> 01:13:47,348
Did you hear what the fuck I just said?

1110
01:13:47,431 --> 01:13:51,902
Just because he came
does not mean you made him come.

1111
01:13:51,991 --> 01:13:56,906
Every man in this room
got two levels of come.

1112
01:13:56,991 --> 01:14:00,267
Every man in here got two levels of come.

1113
01:14:00,351 --> 01:14:02,228
And level one comes out easy,

1114
01:14:02,311 --> 01:14:04,984
it comes out like ketchup,
"Drip, drip, drip, drip,

1115
01:14:05,071 --> 01:14:07,949
"drip, drip, drip,
drip, drip, drip, drip..."

1116
01:14:08,031 --> 01:14:11,307
Just say "come" and it comes out.
"Drip, drip, drip, drip."

1117
01:14:11,391 --> 01:14:13,143
But level two?

1118
01:14:13,231 --> 01:14:17,190
If we got a woman doing
the precise nasty shit we like,

1119
01:14:17,271 --> 01:14:19,831
wearing the nasty shit we want her to wear,

1120
01:14:19,911 --> 01:14:22,505
saying the nasty shit we want her to say,

1121
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:26,425
it will shoot out like a civil rights hose...

1122
01:14:26,511 --> 01:14:28,945
"Free at last! Free at last!"

1123
01:14:31,111 --> 01:14:33,067
It'll take a fucking eye out.

1124
01:14:35,151 --> 01:14:36,903
That's right. That's right.

1125
01:14:36,991 --> 01:14:42,748
Ladies, that's right, that's why you got to be
very careful about what you introduce in bed.

1126
01:14:42,831 --> 01:14:46,426
Ain't no such thing as
one time when it comes to sex,

1127
01:14:46,511 --> 01:14:49,264
cos if we like it, it's on the menu.

1128
01:14:49,991 --> 01:14:52,744
That's right. You got to be very careful.

1129
01:14:52,831 --> 01:14:56,107
You can't be like,
"Ooh, I'm a wear high heels tomorrow."

1130
01:14:56,191 --> 01:14:59,422
No, you gonna wear high heels every day.

1131
01:14:59,511 --> 01:15:05,620
If I ever see the bottom of your
feet again, this relationship is over.

1132
01:15:05,711 --> 01:15:08,430
Like, "Ooh, I'm a do a girl for your birthday."

1133
01:15:08,511 --> 01:15:11,150
No, you gonna do a girl every day.

1134
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:14,985
You better get some
bunk beds in this motherfucker.

1135
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:21,021
Shit, I remember the first time I ever had a girl
suck the come out of my dick and swallow.

1136
01:15:21,111 --> 01:15:22,430
Oh!

1137
01:15:30,311 --> 01:15:33,587
That felt so good, I could read Arabic.

1138
01:15:38,791 --> 01:15:41,988
I was breaking down the Da Vinci code.

1139
01:15:42,071 --> 01:15:45,222
And right then, I said, "Spitters are quitters.

1140
01:15:45,311 --> 01:15:47,029
"Spitters are quitters!"

1141
01:15:47,111 --> 01:15:49,386
There are a lot of women in here grossed out,

1142
01:15:49,471 --> 01:15:52,065
"Come in the mouth?
That's fucking disgusting.

1143
01:15:52,151 --> 01:15:55,029
"You always want to come
in my fucking mouth.

1144
01:15:55,111 --> 01:15:59,229
"Get the fuck out.
You better call that ass-licking girl.

1145
01:15:59,311 --> 01:16:02,030
"You are not coming in my mouth.
Fuck that."

01:16:02,111 --> 01:16:04,830
Yeah, half the women in here are grossed out,

1147
01:16:04,911 --> 01:16:08,586
and the other half are
in loving relationships.

1148
01:16:10,471 --> 01:16:12,621
I'm out of here. Y'all take care.

1149
