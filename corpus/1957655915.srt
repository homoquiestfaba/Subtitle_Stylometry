1
00:01:41,537 --> 00:01:42,958
Look at the design of my watch.

2
00:01:43,058 --> 00:01:44,480
Open slit down the middle.

3
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,843
Look at the colour of my shirt:
salmon... open collar...

4
00:01:47,943 --> 00:01:50,686
I will make a point of
pulling out my wallet:

5
00:01:50,786 --> 00:01:53,789
Open it wide, reach inside...

6
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,091
Look at my cuff links:

7
00:01:55,191 --> 00:01:57,573
Open V design pointed back at me.

8
00:01:57,673 --> 00:01:58,254
Think about it.

9
00:01:58,354 --> 00:02:00,436
What do you think all of this
conveys to a woman?

10
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,322
Open your vagina to me.

11
00:02:07,883 --> 00:02:10,186
All right. We use the power
of suggestion all the time.

12
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:11,667
Why wouldn't I with women?

13
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:13,769
Why would you say that to me?

14
00:02:16,973 --> 00:02:17,473
What?

15
00:02:17,573 --> 00:02:19,575
Did you know I have
an 18 year old daughter?

16
00:02:22,138 --> 00:02:24,040
Did you know I have
an 18 year old daughter?

17
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,517
- No...
- No, I don't have a daughter.

18
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,323
But you didn't know that. Did you?

19
00:02:27,423 --> 00:02:28,761
So what you actually just showed me

20
00:02:28,785 --> 00:02:30,867
is that you're not aware
of what you're presenting.

21
00:02:31,187 --> 00:02:34,371
I don't care what you do
but maybe you should pay attention

22
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:38,395
to the actual image you're transmitting.

23
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:40,757
Hmm...

24
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:46,283
Now, where's the pussy at?

25
00:02:51,288 --> 00:02:52,549
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

26
00:02:52,649 --> 00:02:54,311
Keep it inside.

27
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:56,433
Keep it inside.

28
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:57,034
Sorry.

29
00:02:57,134 --> 00:02:58,555
I know who it is.

30
00:02:58,655 --> 00:03:00,657
You look like Jennifer Lawrence.

31
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:05,182
Hey, don't you think she looks
like Jennifer Lawrence?

32
00:03:06,904 --> 00:03:09,526
Uh, I don't think I know who that is.

33
00:03:09,626 --> 00:03:11,328
You don't know
who Jennifer Lawrence is?

34
00:03:11,428 --> 00:03:13,450
Can I bum one of those?

35
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,252
Yeah I've had that before.

36
00:03:15,352 --> 00:03:16,734
Actually, I was just in a movie

37
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:19,154
and the director made me
step out of the shot. It's hard...

38
00:03:28,886 --> 00:03:31,168
- How are you for money?
- I'm all right, Dad.

39
00:03:37,174 --> 00:03:39,937
How much can a gig at a dive bar pay?

40
00:03:43,821 --> 00:03:45,823
There's a saying, Denny:

41
00:03:46,704 --> 00:03:50,188
"It's not about finding yourself,
it's about creating yourself"

42
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:53,851
When I was your age I was so...

43
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:55,953
Oh, great.

44
00:03:57,555 --> 00:03:58,897
Fucking fantastic.

45
00:03:58,997 --> 00:04:00,999
Very mature.

46
00:04:48,607 --> 00:04:50,069
Hi

47
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:54,573
Sorry uh, did you just smile at me?

48
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:57,116
You just smiled at me.

49
00:04:57,216 --> 00:05:00,459
I don't know. We caught eyes.
I had to do something.

50
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,924
I don't know if that's all that it was.

51
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:05,604
Okay.

52
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:07,767
No, I'm just saying.
We don't have to apologise

53
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:11,010
for having a human interaction, do we?

54
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,573
I'm not going to fall
for this schtick. Sorry.

55
00:05:13,673 --> 00:05:15,615
Schtick? No there's no shtick.

56
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,658
I'm not... I don't know
if this looks like schtick,

57
00:05:18,758 --> 00:05:20,660
but actually I'm very anti-schtick.

58
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,061
I don't like the shtick.

59
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:23,182
- Oh!
- Fuck this schtick.

60
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,284
Okay.

61
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,427
Those your friends?

62
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,529
Uh, yeah. Work friends.

63
00:05:30,249 --> 00:05:31,311
Lawyer?

64
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:32,952
- Yes.
- Uh huh.

65
00:05:33,052 --> 00:05:35,094
Judging? I buy you a drink?

66
00:05:36,095 --> 00:05:37,095
No.

67
00:05:37,176 --> 00:05:38,478
No. Just one drink.

68
00:05:38,578 --> 00:05:39,658
We don't even have to talk.

69
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:41,681
We can just drink it in silence.

70
00:05:41,781 --> 00:05:43,323
No, thank you. I'm seeing someone.

71
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:44,423
So am I. I just...

72
00:05:44,464 --> 00:05:46,224
You probably shouldn't
be hitting on me then.

73
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:47,887
No, I'm not hitting on you.

74
00:05:47,987 --> 00:05:50,570
I just... You you had
a friendly face and I...

75
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,811
- Honestly I...
- This one?

76
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:54,814
Yeah, that one. It's very
friendly from across the way.

77
00:05:54,914 --> 00:05:56,536
Now I'm here, I'm a little scared.

78
00:05:56,636 --> 00:05:59,619
And this is not a big thing.
I can buy your boyfriend a drink.

79
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:01,061
My girlfriend isn't here.

80
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,163
Okay, cool, cool.

81
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:07,668
Can I be honest with you?

82
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:10,270
I'm having a weird moment.

83
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,512
I can't explain.

84
00:06:12,612 --> 00:06:14,875
It's like I'm talking
in tongues or something.

85
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,397
I must be having some
kind of religious experience.

86
00:06:17,497 --> 00:06:18,358
- I'd...
- What?

87
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,681
No I just... I... This is innocent.

88
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,783
I saw you.

89
00:06:23,303 --> 00:06:26,407
Um... I don't... I don't...

90
00:06:26,507 --> 00:06:28,208
Okay, hey listen, it's fine.

91
00:06:28,308 --> 00:06:30,010
Um, I know what you mean.

92
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,532
Do you? Because I don't.

93
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:33,334
I'm going to pretend
I know what you mean.

94
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,434
- Hi!
- Hey!

95
00:06:34,515 --> 00:06:36,517
- Thanks.
- Oh, you work here?

96
00:06:37,157 --> 00:06:39,159
- Play here.
- Cool.

97
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,023
Thank you for not hitting on me.

98
00:06:42,123 --> 00:06:43,864
I wasn't hitting on you.

99
00:06:43,964 --> 00:06:45,226
Okay.

100
00:07:23,445 --> 00:07:25,266
- Hey!
- Hey, Ryan!

101
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:27,068
Hey, it's your round.

102
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:28,910
Oh. Sorry.

103
00:07:34,095 --> 00:07:36,218
One more? Thanks.

104
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:39,341
That was good work on Kleiman.

105
00:07:40,021 --> 00:07:42,784
He's coming later.
Make sure you celebrate with him.

106
00:07:46,668 --> 00:07:49,631
You and me were cut
from the same cloth, Ryan.

107
00:07:50,872 --> 00:07:52,614
I'm going to help you.

108
00:07:52,714 --> 00:07:54,716
But you'll have to work for it.

109
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:00,022
You're with me starting
tomorrow. New case.

110
00:08:00,122 --> 00:08:01,263
The sexual harassment?

111
00:08:01,363 --> 00:08:02,945
Uh huh.

112
00:08:03,045 --> 00:08:05,387
You know Brian Townsend is? The producer?

113
00:08:05,487 --> 00:08:07,830
Yeah, exac-Kleiman's here.

114
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,932
Let's introduce you.

115
00:08:20,222 --> 00:08:22,285
Hey, good job.

116
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:24,046
Really good job.

117
00:08:24,146 --> 00:08:25,007
Thanks.

118
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:28,150
Denny, you looked fantastic tonight.
Really beautiful.

119
00:08:32,034 --> 00:08:34,137
Okay.

120
00:08:34,237 --> 00:08:36,239
Okay.

121
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,482
Good night.

122
00:09:19,443 --> 00:09:21,024
- Hey.
- Lawyer guy.

123
00:09:21,124 --> 00:09:24,448
That was great.
I mean that was fantastic.

124
00:09:24,928 --> 00:09:25,985
I was going to shout for an encore,

125
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:29,313
but I thought maybe
it would be frowned upon.

126
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:31,355
Frowning. I wouldn't want that.

127
00:09:31,455 --> 00:09:34,438
Do you want to stick around
for a little bit? Just… have a drink?

128
00:09:34,538 --> 00:09:36,540
Don't you have a girlfriend?

129
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:39,243
I had a girlfriend.

130
00:09:39,343 --> 00:09:41,345
Just one drink?

131
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:43,707
Sorry.

132
00:09:47,992 --> 00:09:54,959
Woo! Encore! Encore! Encore!

133
00:09:57,121 --> 00:09:58,783
Okay, beers are right here.

134
00:09:58,883 --> 00:10:01,145
All you have to do
is just stop, and drink.

135
00:10:01,245 --> 00:10:03,147
That's it.

136
00:10:03,247 --> 00:10:05,249
- You smiled.
- No I didn't.

137
00:10:12,016 --> 00:10:13,918
Okay. I know what it is.

138
00:10:14,018 --> 00:10:16,020
You don't drink, do you?

139
00:10:22,507 --> 00:10:24,889
You don't normally wear lipstick.

140
00:10:24,989 --> 00:10:26,291
Do you like it?

141
00:10:26,391 --> 00:10:28,393
Yes I do.

142
00:10:31,035 --> 00:10:33,037
Close your eyes.

143
00:10:46,451 --> 00:10:48,233
Why?

144
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,335
I like it on you too.

145
00:10:57,422 --> 00:11:00,045
Unfortunately there was
a problem with our accountant,

146
00:11:00,145 --> 00:11:02,147
so I can't right now.

147
00:11:02,507 --> 00:11:04,650
You said it was definitely
going to be today.

148
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,492
Yea, I'll tell you what...
Um, hang out,

149
00:11:06,592 --> 00:11:09,094
and after I lock everything up,
have a drink with me,

150
00:11:09,194 --> 00:11:11,196
and then I'll see what I can do.

151
00:11:11,757 --> 00:11:14,119
Yea. I'm not going to hang out.

152
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,842
I just want my money and then
I'll get out of your hair.

153
00:11:17,923 --> 00:11:20,606
Hey. Don't make this weird.

154
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:24,830
- Get the fuck off my property.
- Not until I get my money.

155
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,073
Look. You're a pretty
girl, with a pretty voice.

156
00:11:27,173 --> 00:11:28,594
I just wanted some fun songs.

157
00:11:28,694 --> 00:11:30,996
Not a no make up, hair not done...

158
00:11:31,096 --> 00:11:32,438
Fuck you. You fucking asshole!

159
00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:34,440
If you don' like it get the fuck out!

160
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,082
- Hi.
- Who the fuck are you?

161
00:11:36,182 --> 00:11:37,003
What are you doing here?

162
00:11:37,103 --> 00:11:38,103
You're not allowed here!

163
00:11:38,184 --> 00:11:39,605
No, I'm her friend.

164
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:41,888
- He's my lawyer.
- Lawyer?

165
00:11:41,988 --> 00:11:43,049
Um, what's going on?

166
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:44,891
He won't pay me three weeks pay.

167
00:11:44,991 --> 00:11:46,292
Oh, why not?

168
00:11:46,392 --> 00:11:48,915
Oh, I don't know. Maybe 'cause
FUCK OFF. That's why not.

169
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:54,460
When am I going to get my money?

170
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,778
You said you would play covers.

171
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:56,802
I didn't hear any covers.

172
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:57,784
Did you hear covers?

173
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,026
You said you would play
Katy Perry 'Fireworks'...

174
00:12:00,126 --> 00:12:01,628
- I was joking.
- I wasn't.

175
00:12:01,728 --> 00:12:03,550
I like Katy Perry Fireworks.

176
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,991
- Hey...
- Fuck off man!

177
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,953
I would like to help resolve this.

178
00:12:07,053 --> 00:12:08,310
I'm just going to be honest with you.

179
00:12:08,334 --> 00:12:11,117
I work with the Department
of Public Health all the time.

180
00:12:11,217 --> 00:12:12,839
I don't give a shit, man.

181
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:17,163
Listen, just out there I noticed five clear
violations of the food safety code.

182
00:12:17,263 --> 00:12:20,727
Cracked and chipped multi-use food
contact surfaces. Section 11473.

183
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:24,731
Bathroom inside minimum proximity
of a food preparation area. 11472.

184
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:25,132
Ew.

185
00:12:25,232 --> 00:12:27,694
Food preparation sink smaller
than minimum requirement.

186
00:12:27,794 --> 00:12:28,575
There's a lot.

187
00:12:28,675 --> 00:12:29,576
You could get shut down.

188
00:12:29,676 --> 00:12:31,654
Did you see the storeroom?
It's a shithole back there.

189
00:12:31,678 --> 00:12:33,780
You need to work something out.

190
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,882
So don't be a dick.

191
00:12:37,084 --> 00:12:38,505
Okay.

192
00:12:38,605 --> 00:12:40,347
You're right.

193
00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:43,770
I just... I get carried away sometimes.

194
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:51,138
I'll make it up to you.

195
00:12:56,303 --> 00:12:58,926
You think I'm a fucking idiot?

196
00:12:59,026 --> 00:13:01,408
Get the fuck out of here, you fucking...

197
00:13:01,508 --> 00:13:03,531
Motherfucker!

198
00:13:03,631 --> 00:13:05,613
- What a fucking dick.
- Yea, he is.

199
00:13:05,713 --> 00:13:07,174
Don't worry about it.

200
00:13:07,274 --> 00:13:08,892
That fucking piece
of shit's going to pay you.

201
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:12,239
- I'm going to come back. Fucking...
- Hey, it's... It's okay.

202
00:13:14,322 --> 00:13:16,324
So you're… you're good?

203
00:13:16,764 --> 00:13:18,025
Yea.

204
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,587
Alright. Catch you later.

205
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:20,988
Hey. Why'd you help me?

206
00:13:21,088 --> 00:13:23,171
- Huh?
- Why'd you help me?

207
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:25,533
'Cause you want to fuck me?

208
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:26,874
No.

209
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,976
Okay, why?

210
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:32,560
I don't know. No reason.

211
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,722
No reason?

212
00:13:34,822 --> 00:13:36,164
Because I'm not a shitty person?

213
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:39,027
A shitty person would say
they're not a shitty person.

214
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:44,312
But, you know, if you're not a shitty
person then that's a good thing.

215
00:13:47,155 --> 00:13:49,297
Okay.

216
00:13:49,397 --> 00:13:52,200
So you're cool?

217
00:13:53,121 --> 00:13:55,724
You just… waiting to get picked up.

218
00:13:56,124 --> 00:13:58,126
No.

219
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:02,170
You're just enjoying the sidewalk ambience?

220
00:14:04,853 --> 00:14:07,055
I'm waiting for someone to do something.

221
00:14:08,457 --> 00:14:12,621
But if they don't want to do something,
then I guess we won't do something.

222
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:28,397
I want a sandwich.

223
00:14:28,837 --> 00:14:30,839
What?

224
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:34,443
I want a sandwich.

225
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,948
Okay.

226
00:14:39,048 --> 00:14:41,030
Uh, do you want... ham? Turkey?

227
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,132
I'm a vegetarian.

228
00:14:44,413 --> 00:14:46,415
- Butter?
- No butter.

229
00:14:46,936 --> 00:14:48,557
Okay.

230
00:14:48,657 --> 00:14:50,660
PB&J it is.

231
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,965
Alright.

232
00:14:56,065 --> 00:14:58,207
You know you're an unusual date.

233
00:14:58,307 --> 00:15:00,450
How on earth is this a date?

234
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,811
This is not a date.

235
00:15:01,911 --> 00:15:06,736
Ah 'the Lady doth protesteth
much too much methinks'.

236
00:15:06,836 --> 00:15:09,819
(Okay. A) That is nowhere near the quote.

237
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:11,901
(B) I have no idea
what you're talking about

238
00:15:12,001 --> 00:15:14,284
(and C) No.

239
00:15:14,804 --> 00:15:16,546
So it's a 'non-date' then.

240
00:15:16,646 --> 00:15:18,228
Friends.

241
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:21,511
Friends... with a certain chemistry.

242
00:15:21,611 --> 00:15:23,513
- No.
- Friends with no chemistry.

243
00:15:23,613 --> 00:15:24,613
Yes.

244
00:15:24,654 --> 00:15:26,516
Friends with no chemistry who kiss.

245
00:15:26,616 --> 00:15:27,717
We haven't kissed.

246
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:30,060
- We haven't kissed?
- No.

247
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,382
We weren't just kissing?

248
00:15:34,664 --> 00:15:36,726
Okay.

249
00:15:36,826 --> 00:15:38,284
You know, I can still
taste your lip balm.

250
00:15:38,308 --> 00:15:40,310
How is my sandwich doing?

251
00:16:03,854 --> 00:16:06,817
What? What...
Are you kidding me?

252
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:10,421
Really, really.

253
00:17:25,017 --> 00:17:27,199
Hey!

254
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:30,162
Do you have to sit in the exact,
dead center middle of the park?

255
00:17:30,262 --> 00:17:32,264
Huh?

256
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:37,890
I mean is this like the exact furthest
spot from any access point or...?

257
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,613
Oh my god. Did you have
to walk a little to get to me?

258
00:17:40,713 --> 00:17:42,374
I'm horrified. I'm so sorry.

259
00:17:42,474 --> 00:17:44,476
You should be. Apology not accepted.

260
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,882
Um, Chase called.

261
00:17:50,482 --> 00:17:55,348
Some cosmetics company wants to use
one of my songs in a commercial.

262
00:17:55,448 --> 00:17:56,469
That's amazing.

263
00:17:56,569 --> 00:17:59,812
Yea he wants to use my stuff
to sell make-up to little girls.

264
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,615
Okay.

265
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:04,997
How's writing going?

266
00:18:05,097 --> 00:18:07,039
I don't know.

267
00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:09,562
I have pieces.

268
00:18:09,662 --> 00:18:12,485
I just can't put the pieces together.

269
00:18:12,585 --> 00:18:14,247
You play what you have?

270
00:18:14,347 --> 00:18:16,349
- No.
- Just play a little bit.

271
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:19,412
I've seen you play, like, 20 times.

272
00:18:19,512 --> 00:18:20,894
You play for complete strangers.

273
00:18:20,994 --> 00:18:22,976
- Just... Give me a little bit.
- It's different.

274
00:18:23,076 --> 00:18:25,458
Don't. Just stop it. You know
I'm a weirdo about this.

275
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:27,560
You're not a weirdo.

276
00:18:28,481 --> 00:18:30,483
You just play a tiny bit?

277
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:37,390
Turn around.

278
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,512
- Turn around?
- Turn around.

279
00:18:39,612 --> 00:18:42,075
- No, I'm serious. Face away.
- You know I can still hear you?

280
00:18:42,175 --> 00:18:45,559
Stop - Shh. I'm going
to pretend that you can't, so…

281
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:46,659
There you go.

282
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,682
Yea but look away.

283
00:18:48,782 --> 00:18:51,865
- Look away from... Please. Thank you.
- Oh...

284
00:19:28,222 --> 00:19:30,224
Oh, that's it. I don't know.

285
00:19:39,393 --> 00:19:40,414
- Amazing.
- Don't.

286
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:42,937
- Amazing!
- Stop it.

287
00:19:43,037 --> 00:19:45,039
What's it about?

288
00:19:50,244 --> 00:19:52,246
What's that?

289
00:19:53,367 --> 00:19:54,789
It's a four-leaf clover.

290
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:56,271
- Oh really?
- Uh hmm.

291
00:19:56,371 --> 00:19:58,309
- I've never seen one before.
- Hey, what are you doing?

292
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,373
I haven't seen one before.

293
00:19:59,414 --> 00:20:01,392
Oh, so you need to pick it because
you haven't seen one before?

294
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,837
It's a clover. I just...

295
00:20:02,937 --> 00:20:04,439
So? You don't need to pick it.

296
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:05,120
Just leave it.

297
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,342
So we're going to have
an argument about a clover?

298
00:20:08,102 --> 00:20:10,105
Yes.

299
00:20:13,108 --> 00:20:14,525
Fuck you! You're going to squash it!

300
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:16,551
I'm not going to squash it.

301
00:20:17,312 --> 00:20:19,314
I'm going to squash you.

302
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,842
I think I need you.

303
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:34,009
Okay.

304
00:20:36,171 --> 00:20:38,313
- Can I show you something?
- What?

305
00:20:38,413 --> 00:20:40,275
Come on.

306
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,377
- Grab your guitar.
- Okay.

307
00:20:43,098 --> 00:20:45,100
What are you doing?

308
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:50,646
Okay, so that's breaking and entering.

309
00:20:50,746 --> 00:20:52,728
I know a good lawyer.

310
00:20:52,828 --> 00:20:54,570
- Come inside.
- Are you crazy?

311
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,811
Yes.

312
00:20:55,911 --> 00:20:57,913
Watch your head.
Whoa, whoa.

313
00:20:58,394 --> 00:21:00,396
- You good?
- Yes.

314
00:21:08,204 --> 00:21:10,206
I want you to move in with me.

315
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:15,631
What?

316
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:17,393
I want you to move in with me.

317
00:21:17,493 --> 00:21:19,495
I can get the down payment.

318
00:21:21,217 --> 00:21:22,999
This could be...

319
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:25,181
I mean this could be our place.

320
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:31,127
Okay.

321
00:21:31,227 --> 00:21:35,171
If you want this to be your house,
for yourself, then that's amazing.

322
00:21:35,271 --> 00:21:36,929
You're half living
with me anyway. Why not?

323
00:21:36,953 --> 00:21:39,055
Because! Because it's too soon.

324
00:21:39,155 --> 00:21:43,620
And I don't think that I can live up
to the idea you have of who I am.

325
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,781
I don't know who I am.

326
00:21:44,881 --> 00:21:46,543
And you're going to get tired of me.

327
00:21:46,643 --> 00:21:47,780
And I don't want you getting tired of me.

328
00:21:47,804 --> 00:21:50,867
I live with myself 24 hours a day
and trust me, it gets tiring.

329
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:52,789
I'm not going to get tired of you.

330
00:21:52,889 --> 00:21:55,111
And you don't have to live up
to anything. At all.

331
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:56,793
And you've moved in with girls before.

332
00:21:56,893 --> 00:21:58,070
- What's the difference?
- It was different.

333
00:21:58,094 --> 00:21:59,916
- How?
- I don't know.

334
00:22:00,016 --> 00:22:02,058
Come here. Check it out.

335
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:06,143
It's got a little backyard
area where you can write.

336
00:22:38,135 --> 00:22:40,137
Is that fake grass?

337
00:22:40,898 --> 00:22:42,900
We'll replace it.

338
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:53,112
Sorry to do this, I need you
to take the Townsend meeting.

339
00:24:53,953 --> 00:24:57,057
Um, I'd really rather not
take it unprepared.

340
00:24:57,157 --> 00:25:00,500
I mean... The guy seems fucking crazy.

341
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,605
Well, when you're rich and powerful
you can be crazy too.

342
00:25:12,692 --> 00:25:14,514
Was there something else, Mike? Hm?

343
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:16,636
No. No…

344
00:25:16,736 --> 00:25:20,821
Well... my secretary is
getting on my nerves.

345
00:25:21,581 --> 00:25:23,283
Oh yeah? Why'd you hire him?

346
00:25:23,383 --> 00:25:25,405
Oh, he basically begged me.

347
00:25:25,505 --> 00:25:27,127
Why'd you hire her?

348
00:25:27,227 --> 00:25:28,368
Why? What's wrong with her?

349
00:25:28,468 --> 00:25:30,531
She's one of the first
people clients see, Ryan,

350
00:25:30,631 --> 00:25:32,973
and her face looks like
it's been hit by a shovel.

351
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,615
That's ridiculous. She's very good.

352
00:25:34,715 --> 00:25:36,915
No. Honestly, I accidentally
looked at her the other day

353
00:25:36,957 --> 00:25:38,499
and gave me a fright.

354
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:40,341
Okay.

355
00:25:40,441 --> 00:25:41,982
Anyway, you're doing good, okay?

356
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,424
Okay.

357
00:25:43,524 --> 00:25:44,104
Thank you.

358
00:25:44,204 --> 00:25:45,221
Call me with any questions.

359
00:25:45,245 --> 00:25:47,248
Yea.

360
00:26:14,435 --> 00:26:15,697
Yea.

361
00:26:15,797 --> 00:26:17,879
Um, there's someone named Denny calling?

362
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:19,661
Who are you?

363
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:22,283
I'm Randall. Mike said
I was needed here.

364
00:26:24,005 --> 00:26:24,626
Okay.

365
00:26:24,726 --> 00:26:27,629
So, anyway there's a lady named
Denny says she needs to talk to you.

366
00:26:27,729 --> 00:26:29,791
Okay. Put her through.

367
00:26:29,891 --> 00:26:32,413
- Do you have a minute?
- Not really.

368
00:26:32,854 --> 00:26:34,856
I can't stay here, Ryan.

369
00:26:36,378 --> 00:26:36,998
What?

370
00:26:37,098 --> 00:26:39,100
I don't know, I can't stay here.

371
00:26:40,021 --> 00:26:41,683
What does that mean?

372
00:26:41,783 --> 00:26:45,887
I'm... I'm... I'm telling you that
I tried and I can't do this thing.

373
00:26:45,987 --> 00:26:47,689
But why?

374
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:49,971
I don't know. It just
isn't me, I can't do it.

375
00:26:50,071 --> 00:26:52,073
What isn't you?

376
00:26:52,674 --> 00:26:55,017
Hey, sorry, can you just
give me one second?

377
00:26:55,117 --> 00:26:55,817
One sec.

378
00:26:55,917 --> 00:26:58,340
- Yea?
- Ah, Mr Townsend has arrived.

379
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,101
Oh f-

380
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,463
Okay. Just give me one minute.

381
00:27:01,563 --> 00:27:03,665
Okay, he'll be-

382
00:27:03,765 --> 00:27:05,767
Can we talk tonight?

383
00:27:06,088 --> 00:27:08,650
- I'm sorry if I interrupted.
- It's okay.

384
00:27:09,892 --> 00:27:11,193
Where's Mike?

385
00:27:11,293 --> 00:27:13,351
- He's going to be with us Friday.
- All right. Update me.

386
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:14,375
Okay. So...

387
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:16,538
I want to fucking bury
this little homo.

388
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:21,263
Okay?

389
00:30:12,638 --> 00:30:14,640
You don't like it?

390
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,622
No, I like it.

391
00:30:16,722 --> 00:30:23,449
I'm just... I'm not used to the idea
of drawing directly onto walls.

392
00:30:27,853 --> 00:30:29,995
Cool dishes.

393
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:34,520
Were you planning on doing a few,
or is that part of the art installation?

394
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,598
- I just...
- Do you want me to wear an apron, too?

395
00:30:36,622 --> 00:30:38,964
And just be waiting on my knees
for you when you walk in?

396
00:30:39,064 --> 00:30:40,926
Look, you don't have to...

397
00:30:41,026 --> 00:30:43,769
I mean you can just rinse them,
just before the food cakes on.

398
00:30:43,869 --> 00:30:44,971
It doesn't matter.

399
00:30:45,071 --> 00:30:46,652
Regretting having me here?

400
00:30:46,752 --> 00:30:48,754
No.

401
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:55,922
The best part of my day is seeing you.

402
00:30:56,963 --> 00:30:58,664
Shut up.

403
00:30:58,764 --> 00:31:01,387
You're pretty tough until you
get a compliment, aren't ya?

404
00:31:01,487 --> 00:31:02,624
Then you don't know what to do.

405
00:31:02,648 --> 00:31:05,111
- Shut up, dick head.
- So you insult me.

406
00:31:05,211 --> 00:31:07,674
- I said shut up!
- Oh, I'm so avant-garde.

407
00:31:07,774 --> 00:31:08,915
I don't close cabinet doors.

408
00:31:09,015 --> 00:31:11,818
It's better than being
a chauvinist dick, isn't it?

409
00:31:13,499 --> 00:31:14,561
Alright,.

410
00:31:14,661 --> 00:31:16,202
Do you want me
to play for you or not?

411
00:31:16,302 --> 00:31:18,304
Yes.

412
00:31:19,185 --> 00:31:21,187
This is what I've got.

413
00:31:22,228 --> 00:31:24,250
How about I teach you to play?

414
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,652
- No, I'm good.
- Yea.

415
00:31:25,752 --> 00:31:26,573
I'm going to teach you to play.

416
00:31:26,673 --> 00:31:28,010
- I'm fine, thanks.
- Take the guitar.

417
00:31:28,034 --> 00:31:28,575
I'm fine.

418
00:31:28,675 --> 00:31:30,413
I don't have a I don't have
a musical bone in my body.

419
00:31:30,437 --> 00:31:31,778
- Take the guitar
- I'm good.

420
00:31:31,878 --> 00:31:34,881
Or I will rain down on you
with moderate violence.

421
00:31:35,562 --> 00:31:37,564
Oh my god.

422
00:31:52,379 --> 00:31:54,381
I want to look at you.

423
00:31:55,702 --> 00:31:57,704
You want to look at me?

424
00:31:58,185 --> 00:31:59,967
Yea.

425
00:32:15,002 --> 00:32:17,004
Not yet.

426
00:34:04,594 --> 00:34:05,695
Yep.

427
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:07,336
Are you sitting down?

428
00:34:07,436 --> 00:34:08,498
No.

429
00:34:08,598 --> 00:34:10,179
Well sit down.

430
00:34:10,279 --> 00:34:12,281
- Are you sitting down?
- Yea.

431
00:34:12,922 --> 00:34:14,984
I've booked you a gig.

432
00:34:15,084 --> 00:34:16,306
Okay.

433
00:34:16,406 --> 00:34:19,809
Yea, someone dropped out
or some shit but wait for it.

434
00:34:20,249 --> 00:34:22,111
You're opening for Jason Mraz.

435
00:34:22,211 --> 00:34:25,595
- And we'll have reps from Universal,
Atlant- - Jason...? Jason Mraz?

436
00:34:25,695 --> 00:34:28,177
That's... weird.

437
00:34:28,658 --> 00:34:29,879
I said I was going to deliver.

438
00:34:29,979 --> 00:34:31,201
I deliver.

439
00:34:31,301 --> 00:34:33,563
I've had a lot of interest
in your demo.

440
00:34:33,663 --> 00:34:36,206
Shouldn't it be Chase,
you are fantastic.

441
00:34:36,306 --> 00:34:37,767
Or maybe a thank you?

442
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,170
Oh, okay, more reserved
than I'd expect.

443
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,771
But, I'm fine with that.

444
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,613
You can save your energy
for the show.

445
00:34:43,713 --> 00:34:45,715
I'll call you back with the deets.

446
00:35:06,056 --> 00:35:08,058
Babe.

447
00:35:13,343 --> 00:35:19,830
Hey. What did you do to... to your hair?

448
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,373
Nothing. I just wanted to cut it.

449
00:35:22,473 --> 00:35:24,094
Okay. What is going on?

450
00:35:24,194 --> 00:35:25,194
Nothing.

451
00:35:25,276 --> 00:35:29,060
- Really? 'Cause I mean it seems like...
- I just wanted to cut it.

452
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,697
Or should I have sent you
an email or something?

453
00:35:30,721 --> 00:35:32,943
Don't do that. I like it. I do. I just...

454
00:35:33,043 --> 00:35:35,186
I don't know. I just... I liked your hair.

455
00:35:35,286 --> 00:35:36,547
I know. I'm sorry.

456
00:35:36,647 --> 00:35:38,505
And we just... We have
the partner dinner coming up.

457
00:35:38,529 --> 00:35:41,292
- This is important.
- I'll wear a wig or something. It's fine.

458
00:35:42,453 --> 00:35:44,475
Alright. But what's going on?

459
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,313
What's going on is
I'm not your typical wifey,

460
00:35:46,337 --> 00:35:47,737
in case you hadn't noticed already.

461
00:35:47,819 --> 00:35:50,381
That's a cop out. I'm just...
I'm asking you to talk to me.

462
00:35:57,268 --> 00:35:59,771
I've got to run. Can we talk tonight?

463
00:35:59,871 --> 00:36:01,873
- Yea.
- Yea?

464
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:04,135
What's that?

465
00:36:04,235 --> 00:36:06,478
It's a bone. From the wing of a bird.

466
00:36:07,118 --> 00:36:08,900
I'm going to make it into a broach.

467
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,261
Morbid broach.

468
00:36:10,361 --> 00:36:12,444
Only if you consider it so.

469
00:36:13,164 --> 00:36:14,986
Cool.

470
00:36:15,086 --> 00:36:16,428
I've got to go.

471
00:36:16,528 --> 00:36:18,530
Ryan.

472
00:36:19,371 --> 00:36:22,294
I've got this big gig next month, the 26th.

473
00:36:23,775 --> 00:36:26,038
The 26th? That's the night
of the partner dinner.

474
00:36:26,138 --> 00:36:30,782
Yea but I go on at six-thirty
so it's fine, right?

475
00:36:31,263 --> 00:36:32,124
Can you come?

476
00:36:32,224 --> 00:36:34,766
You know what, I'm going to try
and figure something out. Okay?

477
00:36:34,866 --> 00:36:36,868
Okay.

478
00:37:08,981 --> 00:37:11,684
- Oh... Excuse me.
- Sorry.

479
00:37:11,784 --> 00:37:13,786
Didn't mean to surprise you.

480
00:37:15,348 --> 00:37:17,009
Can I help you?

481
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:21,314
No, I… I knew this place.

482
00:37:21,674 --> 00:37:23,416
Hmm.

483
00:37:23,516 --> 00:37:24,857
It's a mess.

484
00:37:24,957 --> 00:37:26,959
Huh, now it is, yea.

485
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,462
- What's it going to be?
- A bakery.

486
00:37:29,562 --> 00:37:31,945
We're going to specialise
in gourmet bagels.

487
00:37:32,045 --> 00:37:33,902
The whole thing's going
to open up through here.

488
00:37:33,926 --> 00:37:35,829
Glass walls there...

489
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:37,931
Yea, it's going to be real nice.

490
00:37:39,292 --> 00:37:41,294
You just... walking?

491
00:37:41,734 --> 00:37:43,316
Yep.

492
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:46,159
- I didn't mean to stop you.
- No, no, of course. No.

493
00:37:46,259 --> 00:37:48,902
I am going to be finishing up soon.

494
00:37:49,502 --> 00:37:51,200
Got a six pack in my truck
if you want to...

495
00:37:51,224 --> 00:37:52,846
Um, I'm okay.

496
00:37:52,946 --> 00:37:54,948
Thanks.

497
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,978
Denny.

498
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:27,741
Denny.

499
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,232
You okay?

500
00:38:38,672 --> 00:38:40,674
Yea.

501
00:38:43,517 --> 00:38:45,519
Let's talk.

502
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,141
We should talk.

503
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:48,422
I'm sleeping.

504
00:38:48,522 --> 00:38:51,165
You're not sleeping.
You're just laying there.

505
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:57,612
Come on we should talk.

506
00:39:00,094 --> 00:39:02,096
Say something.

507
00:39:02,617 --> 00:39:04,118
- Say something?
- Yea.

508
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:06,220
Just talk to me.

509
00:39:09,384 --> 00:39:11,386
- You want me to talk?
- Hmm hmm.

510
00:39:30,045 --> 00:39:32,047
I've never said this before.

511
00:39:33,328 --> 00:39:35,330
Okay.

512
00:39:37,452 --> 00:39:40,876
I'm going to need you
to laugh when I tell you this.

513
00:39:40,976 --> 00:39:42,978
You want me to laugh?

514
00:39:43,618 --> 00:39:45,620
Okay, I can laugh.

515
00:39:46,181 --> 00:39:48,183
Sure.

516
00:39:49,464 --> 00:39:51,466
For a long time,

517
00:39:52,988 --> 00:39:56,031
for a very long time I guess...

518
00:39:59,194 --> 00:40:01,196
Yea?

519
00:40:03,479 --> 00:40:06,041
It's really strange to say out loud.

520
00:40:07,563 --> 00:40:09,565
Okay.

521
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:18,374
I've been having thoughts
about my gender.

522
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,872
Say something.

523
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,602
- Morning.
- Hey.

524
00:41:26,523 --> 00:41:29,126
You want breakfast?
You should have something.

525
00:41:29,967 --> 00:41:31,969
No. I'm okay for now.

526
00:41:33,931 --> 00:41:35,933
Are you okay?

527
00:41:37,614 --> 00:41:39,697
Yea. Yea.

528
00:41:40,377 --> 00:41:43,460
Huh... Shit, I've got to get to work.

529
00:41:44,021 --> 00:41:48,666
Oh, uh, can you wear that black
dress to the partner dinner?

530
00:41:49,266 --> 00:41:51,008
I don't have it anymore.

531
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:54,151
Oh okay, we'll just buy another one.

532
00:41:55,392 --> 00:41:57,395
Bye.

533
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:10,949
- Hey.
- Hey.

534
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,652
How was your day?

535
00:43:13,752 --> 00:43:15,174
Was good.

536
00:43:15,274 --> 00:43:17,276
Great, actually.

537
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:21,600
How was yours?

538
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:24,043
It was okay.

539
00:43:26,725 --> 00:43:29,809
You know I think they might
give me my first case soon.

540
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:32,411
Oh wow, that's great.

541
00:43:32,932 --> 00:43:35,654
- Congratulations.
- Yea thanks.

542
00:43:40,259 --> 00:43:42,261
Thanks for doing the dishes.

543
00:44:23,463 --> 00:44:25,465
I got pizza.

544
00:44:25,986 --> 00:44:27,728
Got you your Hawaiian.

545
00:44:27,828 --> 00:44:30,630
- Extra pineapple.
- Great. Thanks.

546
00:44:56,577 --> 00:44:59,580
Hey, can we go to the uh...

547
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:05,105
Um...

548
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:29,873
Okay, this one.

549
00:47:29,973 --> 00:47:30,874
- I like it.
- Yea?

550
00:47:30,974 --> 00:47:32,115
- Yep.
- I do too.

551
00:47:32,215 --> 00:47:33,116
Cool, let's do it.

552
00:47:33,216 --> 00:47:34,558
- Alright.
- But wait, which one?

553
00:47:34,658 --> 00:47:36,960
- This or that?
- Um, I like this one.

554
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,060
- Better?
- Yea.

555
00:47:38,141 --> 00:47:39,439
- Okay.
- They're the same, but yea.

556
00:47:39,463 --> 00:47:40,924
Okay, I have one more.

557
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,066
- Okay.
- Alright, I'll be right back.

558
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:09,653
See anything you like?

559
00:48:10,134 --> 00:48:11,475
No. I don't see anything I like.

560
00:48:11,575 --> 00:48:13,577
Can you just pick something?

561
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:26,170
Do you need any help?

562
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,272
Yea.

563
00:48:39,764 --> 00:48:41,766
Well that was good.

564
00:48:42,727 --> 00:48:44,929
Good, good, good.

565
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:48,052
I'll be the belle of the ball.

566
00:49:09,394 --> 00:49:11,396
Hey.

567
00:49:34,019 --> 00:49:36,021
Come.

568
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,622
- You want to play?
- No.

569
00:50:35,722 --> 00:50:37,724
Keep practicing.

570
00:50:55,342 --> 00:50:57,084
Did you ever finish that song?

571
00:50:57,184 --> 00:50:59,186
The one you kept going back to?

572
00:51:00,107 --> 00:51:02,789
Almost. Maybe.

573
00:51:05,352 --> 00:51:07,254
Play it for me.

574
00:51:07,354 --> 00:51:09,176
No.

575
00:51:09,276 --> 00:51:11,278
Keep practicing.

576
00:51:44,232 --> 00:51:46,234
Why are you up?

577
00:51:48,075 --> 00:51:50,598
Because my alarm went off.

578
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,282
I didn't notice.

579
00:51:57,365 --> 00:51:59,407
You should get up too.
We could have breakfast.

580
00:52:01,009 --> 00:52:03,892
No. I want to keep dreaming.

581
00:52:08,696 --> 00:52:10,739
But it's wake up time.

582
00:52:15,704 --> 00:52:18,787
It's wake up time. Wake up time.

583
00:52:20,989 --> 00:52:22,991
Wake up time.

584
00:54:13,343 --> 00:54:15,405
Oh, Fuck!

585
00:54:15,505 --> 00:54:16,046
Hey.

586
00:54:16,146 --> 00:54:18,308
I'm never fucking working with her again.

587
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:25,416
Hey.

588
00:54:25,516 --> 00:54:30,561
You didn't tell me you were opening
for Jason Mraz. This is huge.

589
00:54:30,961 --> 00:54:33,184
I did tell you, but…

590
00:54:33,284 --> 00:54:35,706
Yea, but you didn't tell me what it was.

591
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:37,588
You didn't tell me it was Jason Mraz.

592
00:54:37,688 --> 00:54:39,350
Okay well…

593
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:41,152
I'm Ryan by the way.

594
00:54:41,252 --> 00:54:42,833
Hi.

595
00:54:42,933 --> 00:54:43,933
Who are you?

596
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:46,334
I'm Carly, Denny and I have
been friends since high school.

597
00:54:46,377 --> 00:54:47,718
Oh, nice, nice.

598
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:50,721
Um, I saw Chase.
He looked super fucking pissed.

599
00:54:50,821 --> 00:54:53,304
Yea well couldn't give
a shit about Chase, so...

600
00:54:56,107 --> 00:55:00,611
Okay... Well look,
I'm really sorry I missed it.

601
00:55:00,711 --> 00:55:02,814
Did it go okay?

602
00:55:02,914 --> 00:55:05,516
I didn't play. So, yea.

603
00:55:06,718 --> 00:55:08,720
Why?

604
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,862
Because I just didn't want to.

605
00:55:10,962 --> 00:55:15,867
I didn't feel like going out there
and pretending to be a star

606
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:18,890
or whatever the fuck I'm supposed to be.

607
00:55:19,491 --> 00:55:23,134
Okay. That's… bizarre.

608
00:55:24,135 --> 00:55:26,598
Oh. Well then I guess
I'm FUCKING BIZARRE.

609
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,940
I don't know if you've
been paying attention?

610
00:55:29,821 --> 00:55:31,883
- Would you mind just…?
- She can stay.

611
00:55:31,983 --> 00:55:33,525
No. It's okay.

612
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:35,627
I'll just be right outside.

613
00:55:41,633 --> 00:55:43,215
Who is that?

614
00:55:43,315 --> 00:55:45,357
She has nothing to do with this.

615
00:55:45,797 --> 00:55:47,919
I don't deserve this. Okay?

616
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,984
Oh. Oh, you don't deserve this.

617
00:55:52,084 --> 00:55:54,987
Oh, should we have another talk, then?

618
00:55:55,087 --> 00:55:56,108
Hmm?

619
00:55:56,208 --> 00:55:57,870
Is that what you'd like?

620
00:55:57,970 --> 00:55:59,551
I'm waiting, you can go first.

621
00:55:59,651 --> 00:56:01,313
Give me your 'opening address' counselor.

622
00:56:01,413 --> 00:56:03,031
It's going to be a tough crowd
but maybe you can win me over.

623
00:56:03,055 --> 00:56:05,858
You need to fucking stop this! Okay?

624
00:56:08,621 --> 00:56:13,465
Ryan, I cannot fucking stop this!

625
00:56:21,594 --> 00:56:23,596
What do you want me to do?

626
00:56:25,318 --> 00:56:27,320
I don't know.

627
00:56:31,444 --> 00:56:34,167
I'm sorry. We just... we have to get going.

628
00:56:35,848 --> 00:56:38,631
Yea. I'll just... I'll get my bag.

629
00:56:38,731 --> 00:56:40,073
- I'll be...
- Um...

630
00:56:40,173 --> 00:56:42,255
Would you mind…?

631
00:56:44,137 --> 00:56:46,299
I know it's...?

632
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,843
No, it's fine. Yea.
I'll just take a second.

633
00:56:49,943 --> 00:56:51,945
Okay.

634
00:57:01,114 --> 00:57:03,116
Okay.

635
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:37,491
Uh, do you want something?

636
00:57:37,591 --> 00:57:39,773
- I'm okay for now.
- Oh excuse me, excuse me.

637
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,335
This must be Denny.

638
00:57:41,435 --> 00:57:43,177
- Oh.
- I've heard so much.

639
00:57:43,277 --> 00:57:45,179
Enchanting as expected.

640
00:57:45,279 --> 00:57:48,382
Thank you for lowering
your standards for our boy here.

641
00:57:48,482 --> 00:57:50,482
- Yes, lovely to meet you, as well.
- Thanks, Mike.

642
00:57:50,564 --> 00:57:53,948
So, senator Vuletic and Jeffrey
have heard all about you.

643
00:57:54,048 --> 00:57:56,430
Kleiman's here and the partners
want to see you.

644
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:58,532
I set 'em up, you knock 'em down.

645
00:57:59,894 --> 00:58:01,676
- Come on.
- Hang on.

646
00:58:01,776 --> 00:58:02,957
I just met Denny.

647
00:58:03,057 --> 00:58:06,821
You talk business, we'll stay here.
I'll try to entertain our guest.

648
00:58:07,461 --> 00:58:09,584
I'll be right back? Sounds good.

649
00:58:11,105 --> 00:58:13,628
Well, look at this.

650
00:58:14,308 --> 00:58:16,130
- Here you are.
- Here I am.

651
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:18,473
- Can I get you a drink?
- I'm okay, thanks.

652
00:58:21,396 --> 00:58:25,300
Ryan tells me you're
a musician, painter, and writer?

653
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,303
Oh, it seems he has been telling tales.

654
00:58:28,403 --> 00:58:30,765
He is prone to delusions…

655
00:58:33,648 --> 00:58:34,648
I don't blame him.

656
00:58:34,689 --> 00:58:36,851
The best of us are
sometimes, don't you think?

657
00:58:37,572 --> 00:58:39,915
Reality is not always palatable.

658
00:58:40,015 --> 00:58:41,716
Hmm.

659
00:58:41,816 --> 00:58:43,558
You sure I can't get you a drink?

660
00:58:43,658 --> 00:58:45,680
Yea, I'm good thanks.

661
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:47,782
Oh, you missed a spot.

662
00:58:48,343 --> 00:58:50,445
Pardon me?

663
00:58:50,545 --> 00:58:52,627
The natural look. Interesting.

664
00:58:57,112 --> 00:58:59,114
Yea, no, I can't fucking do this.

665
01:00:55,913 --> 01:00:58,135
I saw you looking at my body.

666
01:00:58,235 --> 01:01:00,237
Did you like it?

667
01:02:27,806 --> 01:02:29,808
Hey.

668
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:33,412
I can be crazy too, ya know?

669
01:02:35,014 --> 01:02:36,876
You think I can't be crazy?

670
01:02:36,976 --> 01:02:38,978
What are you talking about?

671
01:02:39,618 --> 01:02:42,541
I could throw this bottle
at the wall right now.

672
01:02:42,982 --> 01:02:44,964
If you want to do it, then do it.

673
01:02:45,064 --> 01:02:47,066
But you wouldn't care, right?

674
01:02:49,068 --> 01:02:51,851
You know, that was my boss
you were talking to tonight.

675
01:02:51,951 --> 01:02:54,293
- Ryan, that guy is a complete-
- No, no, no...

676
01:02:54,393 --> 01:02:56,395
He's my fucking boss.

677
01:02:57,476 --> 01:02:58,618
Okay.

678
01:02:58,718 --> 01:03:01,360
I'm... I'm sorry.

679
01:03:01,761 --> 01:03:05,265
By the way, I don't think
I've ever complimented you

680
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:09,108
on the brilliant additions
to our living room wall.

681
01:03:09,208 --> 01:03:11,591
I mean I do just have one small thing...

682
01:03:11,691 --> 01:03:15,915
Cabinet doors, generally they're
attached to cabinets, not to walls.

683
01:03:16,015 --> 01:03:18,017
But other than that…

684
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,502
- Why?
- Ryan...

685
01:03:23,143 --> 01:03:25,705
No, no seriously. I want to know why?

686
01:03:28,108 --> 01:03:29,409
Because I like it there.

687
01:03:29,509 --> 01:03:33,573
I thought maybe there's something
or someone BEHIND the door?

688
01:03:33,673 --> 01:03:35,856
What do you think?
I don't know. Let's see.

689
01:03:35,956 --> 01:03:37,958
Hello? Anyone there?

690
01:03:38,438 --> 01:03:39,499
I don't hear anything.

691
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,181
Oh, hang on. Let's ask this guy?

692
01:03:41,281 --> 01:03:42,881
He's kind of like a next door neighbour.

693
01:03:42,923 --> 01:03:46,526
Uh, excuse me sir, can you help us here?

694
01:03:47,007 --> 01:03:49,429
Nope, no news there.
Fuck, I don't know.

695
01:03:49,529 --> 01:03:51,351
Uh, I know.

696
01:03:51,451 --> 01:03:54,595
Maybe there's a surprise
behind... THE DOOR.

697
01:03:54,695 --> 01:03:57,177
I think I'm going to do it.
I'm going to open it.

698
01:03:58,058 --> 01:03:59,978
I'm a little scared.
I'm going to count to three.

699
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:00,961
Okay ready?

700
01:04:01,061 --> 01:04:02,323
One…

701
01:04:02,423 --> 01:04:04,124
two…

702
01:04:04,224 --> 01:04:05,646
three!

703
01:04:05,746 --> 01:04:08,889
Oh! Wow! Wow!

704
01:04:08,989 --> 01:04:11,992
Nothing but completely blank fucking wall.

705
01:04:12,313 --> 01:04:13,214
What do you know, huh?

706
01:04:13,314 --> 01:04:15,636
Nothing but wall behind the magic door.

707
01:04:17,798 --> 01:04:19,800
What's the point?

708
01:04:26,847 --> 01:04:28,849
What's that?

709
01:04:31,732 --> 01:04:33,734
- Hm?
- What does it look like?

710
01:04:35,776 --> 01:04:37,679
Why wouldn't you tell me?

711
01:04:37,779 --> 01:04:39,641
What was I supposed to tell you?

712
01:04:39,741 --> 01:04:41,743
How?

713
01:04:44,585 --> 01:04:46,908
I tried to talk to you and just…

714
01:04:48,389 --> 01:04:51,372
Ryan, I'm not doing this to ruin your life.

715
01:04:51,472 --> 01:04:53,695
I'm not doing this to ruin our life.

716
01:04:53,795 --> 01:04:56,077
It's not because I think it's fucking cool.

717
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,602
I don't want this either.

718
01:05:01,923 --> 01:05:03,064
It's not that simple for me,

719
01:05:03,164 --> 01:05:05,367
it's not just a choice that I can make.

720
01:05:10,011 --> 01:05:14,576
I wish there was a way that I could
tell you that you would like.

721
01:05:15,016 --> 01:05:19,201
I wish I had the answers
you wanted to fucking hear.

722
01:05:19,301 --> 01:05:23,665
I wish… I wish, Ryan. I wish I did.

723
01:05:27,069 --> 01:05:29,071
Well now it's all out there, huh?

724
01:05:43,045 --> 01:05:45,047
I want you to fuck me.

725
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:50,172
What are you doing?

726
01:05:51,654 --> 01:05:53,656
I'm wearing your favourite fucking bra.

727
01:05:54,537 --> 01:05:55,998
What are you doing?

728
01:05:56,098 --> 01:05:59,342
- What you don't want to fuck me anymore.
- Stop it. Stop it.

729
01:06:01,304 --> 01:06:03,586
Look at me, Ryan.

730
01:06:05,468 --> 01:06:07,330
Yeah.

731
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:09,432
You afraid it's going to make you gay?

732
01:06:11,314 --> 01:06:13,496
Can't have the partners
at the office find out, right,

733
01:06:13,596 --> 01:06:16,519
Your girlfriend is not
really a fucking girl. Huh?

734
01:06:18,601 --> 01:06:20,743
You're lucky to fuck me.

735
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:22,845
You know that, right?

736
01:07:40,004 --> 01:07:42,006
Ryan.

737
01:07:43,367 --> 01:07:45,369
We should sleep.

738
01:07:54,339 --> 01:07:55,600
Ryan.

739
01:07:55,700 --> 01:08:00,505
Would play me that song that you
were working on forever?

740
01:08:01,346 --> 01:08:04,409
You know the one that you wouldn't
play for me? You finished it, right?

741
01:08:04,509 --> 01:08:06,091
Ryan, I need to talk to you.

742
01:08:06,191 --> 01:08:09,114
Just a couple of lines. Please.

743
01:09:09,495 --> 01:09:16,042
I have no problem with you
wearing men's clothes or whatever.

744
01:09:16,142 --> 01:09:16,562
I just...

745
01:09:16,662 --> 01:09:21,787
I am not going to stop
taking testosterone.

746
01:09:30,757 --> 01:09:32,759
I didn't know how to tell you.

747
01:09:40,807 --> 01:09:44,050
And I need to consider
my options for my future.

748
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:55,462
I need to figure it out.

749
01:09:58,064 --> 01:10:00,066
And I'm going to look different.

750
01:10:01,188 --> 01:10:03,190
I'm going to sound different.

751
01:10:03,710 --> 01:10:05,712
I'm going to be different.

752
01:10:10,877 --> 01:10:16,043
I just... I don't… I don't
fucking fit in this box.

753
01:10:17,564 --> 01:10:20,607
I don't fit in this body.

754
01:10:27,414 --> 01:10:29,416
Am I your box?

755
01:10:40,107 --> 01:10:42,109
Am I your box?

756
01:10:44,792 --> 01:10:46,794
Hmm?

757
01:10:51,519 --> 01:10:53,641
I mean, is this your box?

758
01:10:54,842 --> 01:10:56,844
Is this…?

759
01:10:58,486 --> 01:11:03,291
I mean, it's a pretty nice box.

760
01:11:05,213 --> 01:11:07,455
Am I your fucking box?

761
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:10,318
You know we can just break the box.

762
01:11:10,418 --> 01:11:11,799
Hey!

763
01:11:11,899 --> 01:11:14,182
We can just break the box.

764
01:11:36,485 --> 01:11:40,168
Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck.

765
01:13:19,389 --> 01:13:21,391
Hey.

766
01:13:32,202 --> 01:13:34,204
You look tired.

767
01:13:38,369 --> 01:13:40,371
I'm sorry for…

768
01:13:43,894 --> 01:13:47,938
I was surprised.

769
01:13:50,581 --> 01:13:52,583
That was unacceptable.

770
01:13:53,744 --> 01:13:57,308
I would never normally
do that. Act like that.

771
01:13:58,029 --> 01:14:02,033
I... I just...

772
01:14:02,753 --> 01:14:04,135
This isn't me.

773
01:14:04,235 --> 01:14:05,536
Yeah, okay.

774
01:14:05,636 --> 01:14:07,638
I know.

775
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,062
Thank you. Yea.

776
01:14:11,162 --> 01:14:13,104
Can you talk to me?

777
01:14:13,204 --> 01:14:16,127
- Please.
- Um... I can do my best.

778
01:14:17,969 --> 01:14:19,971
I miss you so much.

779
01:14:20,932 --> 01:14:22,934
Yea, me too.

780
01:14:24,776 --> 01:14:26,778
Come home.

781
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:33,425
You can talk to somebody?

782
01:14:35,066 --> 01:14:36,968
What does that mean?

783
01:14:37,068 --> 01:14:41,713
Nothing. Just this is a serious thing.

784
01:14:42,914 --> 01:14:46,638
Denny, I am not going to let you
get rid of me that easily.

785
01:14:49,681 --> 01:14:53,305
So what you really came here
to tell me is that I need help?

786
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:55,807
No. That's not what I meant.

787
01:14:59,531 --> 01:15:01,193
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

788
01:15:01,293 --> 01:15:03,295
That's not what the problem is.

789
01:15:04,897 --> 01:15:07,039
I can be there for you.

790
01:15:07,139 --> 01:15:09,221
Ryan, this isn't going to change.

791
01:15:10,342 --> 01:15:12,344
I'm not sick.

792
01:15:12,985 --> 01:15:16,749
You're saying these things but I don't
feel like you're saying them to me.

793
01:15:24,637 --> 01:15:27,380
I mean… do you… do you feel like…

794
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:30,523
do you want to…

795
01:15:33,366 --> 01:15:35,368
Do you feel like a man?

796
01:15:38,891 --> 01:15:40,893
No...

797
01:15:41,894 --> 01:15:45,338
But, you know, I'm not a man or a woman.

798
01:15:48,341 --> 01:15:50,343
Okay?

799
01:15:52,665 --> 01:15:55,388
And I'm not what you want me to be.

800
01:16:01,394 --> 01:16:03,096
We shouldn't see each other for a bit.

801
01:16:03,196 --> 01:16:04,057
Denny, listen, listen.

802
01:16:04,157 --> 01:16:06,639
Hey Denny, Denny.
Denny don't do that.

803
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:48,022
Denny.

804
01:18:01,716 --> 01:18:03,718
Hey.

805
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,261
What are you doing?

806
01:18:06,361 --> 01:18:08,363
Hi.

807
01:18:08,764 --> 01:18:10,261
Don't do this. Okay?
Don't make this...

808
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:11,542
I told you I was going to be here.

809
01:18:11,566 --> 01:18:13,108
I'm here.

810
01:18:13,208 --> 01:18:16,091
- Ryan
- Just... if you want me.

811
01:18:17,813 --> 01:18:19,815
Okay?

812
01:20:00,838 --> 01:20:02,840
You okay?

813
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:05,643
Yep.

814
01:20:07,605 --> 01:20:09,607
Okay.

815
01:21:44,863 --> 01:21:48,427
It's like I like you so much
that you being around...

816
01:21:49,989 --> 01:21:52,351
I just feel like I can't
do what I need to do.

817
01:22:08,167 --> 01:22:10,169
I love you.

818
01:22:11,771 --> 01:22:13,773
I love you.

819
01:22:22,902 --> 01:22:24,904
I think I need you.

820
01:22:45,645 --> 01:22:47,647
I know you're here to help.

821
01:22:49,569 --> 01:22:51,111
I can't see you anymore.

822
01:22:51,211 --> 01:22:53,213
What Denny...?

823
01:23:08,549 --> 01:23:11,191
- Hi.
- Hi. Um, Denny Weir.

824
01:23:14,595 --> 01:23:16,597
Please take a seat.
It won't be long.

825
01:23:37,898 --> 01:23:39,900
Are you waiting?

826
01:23:41,422 --> 01:23:44,225
I'm actually here with my brother.

827
01:23:46,667 --> 01:23:48,790
But he said Dr Kali's really nice.

828
01:23:53,114 --> 01:23:55,116
That's a really nice dress.

829
01:23:56,798 --> 01:23:58,800
Thank you.

830
01:25:18,521 --> 01:25:21,244
Oh, there you are. Are you ready?

831
01:25:21,804 --> 01:25:23,806
- Yea.
- Okay, let's go.

832
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:29,492
Just up on the left.

833
01:25:29,892 --> 01:25:31,894
Okay.

834
01:25:55,318 --> 01:25:57,461
You want a bagel, hun?

835
01:25:57,561 --> 01:25:58,582
Sure.

836
01:25:58,682 --> 01:26:00,784
Do you want it toasted?

837
01:26:00,884 --> 01:26:02,786
Uh, no.

838
01:26:02,886 --> 01:26:06,930
They're from that new gourmet
bagel place down the street.

839
01:26:09,212 --> 01:26:11,214
You want butter?

840
01:26:11,895 --> 01:26:13,997
Uh, no, thanks.

841
01:26:14,097 --> 01:26:15,799
Nothing?

842
01:26:15,899 --> 01:26:16,960
Nope.

843
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:19,002
You are so weird.

844
01:26:19,102 --> 01:26:21,165
Thank you.

845
01:26:21,265 --> 01:26:22,265
I got to go.

846
01:26:22,306 --> 01:26:23,927
Okay, you parked behind me?

847
01:26:24,027 --> 01:26:26,030
Yea.

848
01:26:34,038 --> 01:26:36,040
You okay?

849
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:37,701
Yea.

850
01:26:37,801 --> 01:26:38,622
See ya.

851
01:26:38,722 --> 01:26:40,724
- Bye.
- Bye.

852
01:26:51,175 --> 01:26:53,177
You look like you could use a drink.

853
01:26:54,338 --> 01:26:56,340
Way ahead of you.

854
01:26:57,021 --> 01:26:59,183
I like a man who drinks gin.

855
01:27:01,706 --> 01:27:05,309
It's not me. But it suits you.

856
01:27:09,754 --> 01:27:11,536
You're looking stressed lately, Ryan.

857
01:27:11,636 --> 01:27:13,578
I'm worried about you.

858
01:27:13,678 --> 01:27:16,621
I want to make sure you
take enough time to breathe.

859
01:27:16,721 --> 01:27:17,542
Have some fun.

860
01:27:17,642 --> 01:27:18,802
Are you getting any time out?

861
01:27:18,843 --> 01:27:21,426
- Uh, not really.
- Let's change that.

862
01:27:21,526 --> 01:27:23,528
You know I want to help you?

863
01:27:24,409 --> 01:27:25,911
Yea. Sure.

864
01:27:26,011 --> 01:27:28,013
I like helping you, Ryan.

865
01:27:29,214 --> 01:27:31,296
I want to keep being there for you.

866
01:27:34,139 --> 01:27:37,903
There are not that many people
in this world I deeply respect.

867
01:27:38,784 --> 01:27:41,486
But you... I deeply respect.

868
01:27:41,586 --> 01:27:43,588
Thanks.

869
01:27:48,794 --> 01:27:51,316
We set our own limits, Ryan.

870
01:27:53,238 --> 01:27:56,562
There are no limits,
but the ones we set on ourselves.

871
01:27:58,403 --> 01:27:59,745
What the fuck are you doing?

872
01:27:59,845 --> 01:28:01,182
- I'm asking you...
- What the fuck...

873
01:28:01,206 --> 01:28:03,989
I was going to ask if you think
you can take lead on Townsend!

874
01:28:04,089 --> 01:28:05,991
What do you...

875
01:28:06,091 --> 01:28:09,134
You misunderstood me, Ryan.
I'm trying to give you Townsend.

876
01:28:11,136 --> 01:28:13,138
What do you think I'm talking about?

877
01:28:16,101 --> 01:28:17,643
Jesus, Ryan.

878
01:28:17,743 --> 01:28:19,745
Get some sleep, alright.

879
01:28:20,226 --> 01:28:22,228
Don't lose it on me.

880
01:28:23,109 --> 01:28:24,250
You alright?

881
01:28:24,350 --> 01:28:26,052
Yeah, I'm fine.

882
01:28:26,152 --> 01:28:27,333
You sure?

883
01:28:27,433 --> 01:28:29,435
I'm good.

884
01:28:30,196 --> 01:28:32,198
Alright.

885
01:28:58,505 --> 01:29:00,407
- Yea?
- I've got Mike.

886
01:29:00,507 --> 01:29:02,208
Okay.

887
01:29:02,308 --> 01:29:03,370
Mike?

888
01:29:03,470 --> 01:29:06,333
I'm going to sit in on your meeting
with Townsend. How's it coming?

889
01:29:06,433 --> 01:29:07,694
I think it's fine.

890
01:29:07,794 --> 01:29:09,536
Hey! Never fear.

891
01:29:09,636 --> 01:29:11,918
- You've got me. Okay?
- Okay. Thanks.

892
01:29:16,923 --> 01:29:17,664
Yea?

893
01:29:17,764 --> 01:29:19,306
There's a visitor here for you.

894
01:29:19,406 --> 01:29:20,467
A visitor?

895
01:29:20,567 --> 01:29:23,690
Yes, uh 'Denny' is here to see you.

896
01:29:26,093 --> 01:29:28,095
Okay. Okay, sure.

897
01:29:45,913 --> 01:29:48,956
I went to your house...
and then I thought…

898
01:29:52,279 --> 01:29:53,981
Okay. Yea, maybe I shouldn't have come.

899
01:29:54,081 --> 01:29:57,204
- I understand if...
- No, no, no...

900
01:29:59,126 --> 01:30:01,128
It's good to see you.

901
01:30:11,579 --> 01:30:13,581
I'm sorry for the way things happened.

902
01:30:14,422 --> 01:30:16,404
You don't have to be sorry.

903
01:30:16,504 --> 01:30:18,506
I'm sorry.

904
01:30:21,189 --> 01:30:23,191
Okay.

905
01:30:35,083 --> 01:30:37,025
- Practicing.
- Oh yea.

906
01:30:37,125 --> 01:30:39,143
But you know, I don't have
a musical bone in my body.

907
01:30:39,167 --> 01:30:41,169
Don't do that.

908
01:30:47,816 --> 01:30:49,818
Play something?

909
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:53,822
No.

910
01:30:56,064 --> 01:30:58,066
I don't.

911
01:30:58,787 --> 01:31:00,989
I haven't played in a while.

912
01:31:06,475 --> 01:31:08,797
You're going to keep
practicing though, right?

913
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:12,701
Townsend's here. Let's go.

914
01:31:12,801 --> 01:31:15,524
- Oh, uh...
- Come on, let's go.

915
01:31:16,565 --> 01:31:18,067
I'm going to have to miss it.

916
01:31:18,167 --> 01:31:19,348
No. It's okay. Go on.

917
01:31:19,448 --> 01:31:22,371
Yes. Come on, let's go.

918
01:31:23,532 --> 01:31:25,534
No, I'm sorry. I can't.

919
01:31:26,135 --> 01:31:27,957
Ryan...

920
01:31:28,057 --> 01:31:30,395
Tell it to get out of your office
and get to the boardroom, now.

921
01:31:30,419 --> 01:31:32,421
Shut up Mike.

922
01:31:38,868 --> 01:31:43,012
So, are you going to take
another week off, sit in the corner?

923
01:31:43,112 --> 01:31:45,114
Don't be stupid.

924
01:31:45,755 --> 01:31:50,239
Get into the boardroom,
or leave and don't come back.

925
01:31:59,609 --> 01:32:01,511
- Let's go.
- What?

926
01:32:01,611 --> 01:32:03,613
- What are you doing?
- Come on. Let's go.

927
01:32:15,265 --> 01:32:16,967
There are critical elements
as you can see.

928
01:32:17,067 --> 01:32:19,990
1. Knock on the door, identify the...

929
01:32:52,302 --> 01:32:54,305
You feel like a beer?

930
01:32:54,825 --> 01:32:56,767
Sure, Denny.

931
01:32:56,867 --> 01:32:58,869
Actually, it's just Den.

932
01:33:00,511 --> 01:33:02,012
Den.
